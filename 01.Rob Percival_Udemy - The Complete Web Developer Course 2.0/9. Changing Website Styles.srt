1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:00,920
All right.

2
00:00:00,920 --> 00:00:04,950
So hopefully you're getting the idea of how Jay quivery works in this video.

3
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:10,750
We're going to move on from seeing how we can change content with Jake rary to how we can change styles.

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,850
So let's go back to just having our circle.

5
00:00:15,190 --> 00:00:23,250
So I'll get rid of my I-frame and as a quick challenge can you from scratch write a little bit of code

6
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:30,220
that will alert halo when you click on the circle using Jay queery of Coop's effort.

7
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:38,130
I hope you remember that.

8
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:40,090
We start with string.

9
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:50,830
And then in parentheses and double quotes we use hash and circle to select the object with idea of circle.

10
00:00:50,890 --> 00:00:58,380
You could use Dave there I guess as well as we've only got one Dave and then we want to set up a click

11
00:00:59,030 --> 00:00:59,860
function.

12
00:01:02,440 --> 00:01:10,420
Parentheses after function and then curly brackets and a closing parenthesis then there to contain our

13
00:01:10,420 --> 00:01:19,300
code and then it's just a lot like in good old fashioned javascript like.

14
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,560
Let's have a look.

15
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:22,280
Click on there.

16
00:01:22,300 --> 00:01:23,000
Hello.

17
00:01:23,380 --> 00:01:23,950
Fantastic.

18
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:30,550
So hopefully that reminded you the basic syntax for setting up a correct function.

19
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,250
What we're going to do now is change some styles of our circle when it is clicked and this is super

20
00:01:36,250 --> 00:01:41,440
easy today with Jake Weary as you might guess the first thing we need to do is select the thing that

21
00:01:41,440 --> 00:01:43,360
we want to change the style of.

22
00:01:43,900 --> 00:01:52,330
So again it's hash circle and then we use don't see SS to change the process.

23
00:01:52,990 --> 00:01:57,310
And then we just give the name of the property that we want to change and the value that we want to

24
00:01:57,310 --> 00:01:58,340
change it to.

25
00:01:58,720 --> 00:02:06,070
So if we want to change with for example we use width and then we set the width to whatever we want

26
00:02:06,070 --> 00:02:06,630
it to be.

27
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:12,740
So I'd say 400 pixels Let's have a look.

28
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:13,650
There you go.

29
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:15,120
It stretches out.

30
00:02:15,460 --> 00:02:18,380
So could you for example change the background color to red.

31
00:02:18,550 --> 00:02:20,440
When it's clicked Durford

32
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:26,900
you got it.

33
00:02:26,950 --> 00:02:33,490
It's just a matter of changing background color to red.

34
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:35,580
Simple as that.

35
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:36,600
There we go.

36
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,530
It's super simple and you can experiment as much as you like with changing different properties to different

37
00:02:41,530 --> 00:02:42,240
values.

38
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,420
We can also get the values of particular properties using exactly the same function.

39
00:02:47,470 --> 00:02:54,270
So if we wanted to know what the background color of a particular object was we could find that out

40
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,400
by just getting rid of the value of the property there.

41
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:06,390
So just like we did with HTL if we have a property and the value then that will change the value of

42
00:03:06,390 --> 00:03:12,550
the property to whatever you state if we just have the property that will return the value of that property.

43
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:22,640
So if we take a look we could alert that whole thing and get the background color that we get.

44
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:29,960
So it's in the form Oggi 0 1 2 8 0 which is another way of saying green So a quick challenge for you

45
00:03:29,960 --> 00:03:38,750
then can you get the width of the body of the page so the width of the body of this web page for

46
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:50,670
you got to remember to select elements we don't use a hash or a dot.

47
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,050
We just use the word or the name of the element that we want to select so body.

48
00:03:56,300 --> 00:04:02,540
And then if we want the width we just change the CSSA property to width.

49
00:04:02,660 --> 00:04:07,180
Let's take a look at 591 pixels.

50
00:04:07,490 --> 00:04:13,470
And interestingly that will change if we make the page wider on our.

51
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:16,090
So now we're up to about 21 pixels.

52
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:21,410
So that can actually be quite useful if you want to change your website layout depending on the width

53
00:04:21,410 --> 00:04:22,050
of the page.

54
00:04:22,070 --> 00:04:27,600
You can use J query to get that with for you and then do something with it if you want it.

55
00:04:28,310 --> 00:04:30,930
All right there's one more thing I want to show you in this video.

56
00:04:30,950 --> 00:04:34,790
And for that only my squares back.

57
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:48,050
So I'm going to bring in my divs with a class of squared and then I'll just recreate the CSSA for them.

58
00:04:48,140 --> 00:04:56,240
So we'll just change that to square and get rid of the border radius and set the background color to

59
00:04:56,360 --> 00:04:58,450
red.

60
00:04:58,460 --> 00:04:59,020
Take a look.

61
00:04:59,030 --> 00:04:59,600
There they are.

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:00,770
Wonderful.

63
00:05:00,770 --> 00:05:08,600
So what if we wanted to set up a function which made each of these disappear when they're clicked.

64
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:12,830
Why don't you have a quick go at attempting to do that.

65
00:05:12,830 --> 00:05:13,500
Best of luck.

66
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:25,680
OK I hope you found a little bit of a problem there because what I hope you are tempted to do rather

67
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:30,540
than have a separate function for each div and give these two an idea or something like that which is

68
00:05:30,540 --> 00:05:30,990
a bit messy.

69
00:05:30,990 --> 00:05:32,920
We want to do it in a single function.

70
00:05:33,030 --> 00:05:41,640
We might have tried something like Dave click function so that will action a function that will happen

71
00:05:41,910 --> 00:05:43,630
when any of those is clicked.

72
00:05:43,980 --> 00:05:48,670
And then you may have tried something like Dave and then to make it disappear.

73
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:56,180
We could use VSS and then you may have remembered setting display equal to none.

74
00:05:56,220 --> 00:06:01,590
Is there a way of making things disappear so that looks reasonably promising but let's have a look and

75
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:02,870
see how it behaves.

76
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:04,130
I click on the circle.

77
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:09,380
It makes all of them disappear which of course we should do because we're saying select everything that's

78
00:06:09,410 --> 00:06:11,980
cool the div and make it disappear.

79
00:06:12,780 --> 00:06:19,710
So how do we create a single function which somehow knows which element has been clicked.

80
00:06:20,010 --> 00:06:21,600
Well that's actually really easy.

81
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:29,130
And there's a very powerful javascript NJ query idea that I'm going to show you to do this and it is

82
00:06:30,320 --> 00:06:33,310
the very simple keyword this.

83
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,290
So on the surface of it this seems quite simple.

84
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:40,250
In practice this can be a little bit of a nightmare to figure out what it's actually referring to.

85
00:06:40,410 --> 00:06:48,690
But in this context all it is is in our case this is going to be the element that has been clicked.

86
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:51,610
So it's the element that we're dealing with at the moment.

87
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,760
So let's take a look and see what happens.

88
00:06:53,760 --> 00:06:59,810
Now if I click on the green circle that disappears if I click on one of the red squares that disappears.

89
00:06:59,970 --> 00:07:02,580
And obviously the final one does as well.

90
00:07:02,580 --> 00:07:08,070
So this is a really useful keyword if you want to have a single function that applies to a number of

91
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:09,600
different elements.

92
00:07:09,750 --> 00:07:16,650
But then but then it does something depending on which element is clicked or hovered or selected or

93
00:07:16,650 --> 00:07:17,740
whatever.

94
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:19,640
Then this is a great way to do that.

95
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,600
So I'll give you another quick example.

96
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:28,170
If we wanted to just alert whether the user had clicked on a circle or a square we could use this to

97
00:07:28,170 --> 00:07:29,200
do that.

98
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,700
And there's a number of ways that we could do that but I'll show you something like this.

99
00:07:34,100 --> 00:07:42,910
So if we weren't alert and then you clicked on.

100
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:51,270
And then we wanted the name of the shape then we could give the idea of the shape if it was a circle

101
00:07:52,230 --> 00:07:54,120
and we'd get that from

102
00:07:57,600 --> 00:08:09,780
this dot attributes and then Id say let's have a quick look about that in action.

103
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:12,020
There we go.

104
00:08:12,200 --> 00:08:13,840
You clicked on the circle.

105
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:15,610
So we've got the ID.

106
00:08:15,650 --> 00:08:19,880
Obviously that's not going to work for this one because they don't have an ID.

107
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:22,230
You clicked on a undefined.

108
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:23,840
That's not what we want.

109
00:08:23,860 --> 00:08:31,250
So to get the square in we need to add in an IF statement so we can look to see if

110
00:08:35,240 --> 00:08:40,570
the ID is equal to a circle.

111
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:41,730
Then

112
00:08:44,490 --> 00:08:52,710
alert that and it probably makes sense to change that out to just be plain text.

113
00:08:52,710 --> 00:08:56,520
We could then change it to green circle or something if we wanted to.

114
00:08:57,840 --> 00:08:58,830
And Else

115
00:09:02,940 --> 00:09:05,690
let you clicked

116
00:09:11,010 --> 00:09:11,490
on a square

117
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:15,110
Let's have a look.

118
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:18,140
We got fantastic.

119
00:09:18,510 --> 00:09:24,420
Obviously we could check for classes or other ways to distinguish between different elements if we wanted

120
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:28,830
to here as well if we wanted to search for more than two different types of elements.

121
00:09:29,190 --> 00:09:34,410
It's worth noting that this is a javascript keyword as well as everyone.

122
00:09:34,470 --> 00:09:37,240
So you can use it in plain javascript if you want to.

123
00:09:37,650 --> 00:09:46,440
OK so now we've seen the this keyword and also how to affect styles and to return the styles of particular

124
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,040
elements.

125
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,840
We're going to start looking at some jay Querrey Pacific features now and the first one I'll show you

126
00:09:51,840 --> 00:09:53,250
is fading content.
