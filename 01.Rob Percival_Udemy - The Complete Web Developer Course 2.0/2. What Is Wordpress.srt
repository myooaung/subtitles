00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:04,500
In this section we're going to be looking at a platform called WordPress.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,010
Wordpress is what's known as a content management system or CMOS and it's essentially a way of managing

3
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:15,450
your site which in theory avoids the need for code entirely.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:20,250
It was originally developed for blogging and allowed people very easily to add new blog posts.

5
00:00:20,340 --> 00:00:26,580
Change the style of their blog without any knowledge of HCM Eliseus as a tool it's developed since then

6
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:33,540
there are a whole web site management tool and now powers an astonishing 25 percent of all Web sites.

7
00:00:33,540 --> 00:00:36,410
I'm going to recommend that you get to grips with it because it's free.

8
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,620
It's easy to use.

9
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:42,450
There's a huge amount of support online and you can make great looking sites that your clients will

10
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:45,620
be able to update and manage themselves.

11
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:46,440
Excited.

12
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:47,560
I hope so.

13
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:49,420
Let's get cracking.

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:52,040
To use Wordpress you need a web server.

15
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:53,760
And of course you're very lucky.

16
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,020
That's with the complete web developer of course.

17
00:00:56,050 --> 00:00:56,640
Get a years.

18
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:57,930
Web hosting for free.

19
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,480
So if you haven't set up your first hosting package yet then go to the hosting section of this course.

20
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:10,950
Follow the instructions then if you've done that go to eco web hosting Dockerty UK slash C.P slash managed

21
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:15,090
hosting and that should list the domain names that you've set up.

22
00:01:15,090 --> 00:01:21,750
The one that I'm going to be working with today is one called a WordPress test domain dot com and if

23
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:29,370
I click on that it'll open up the control panel for this test domain and I'll be able to install WordPress

24
00:01:29,370 --> 00:01:31,420
directly from there.

25
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:36,420
Most web hosts do have this functionality so if you're already set up with a different web host I'm

26
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:38,420
sure you'll be able to do the same thing with them.

27
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,810
With the correct though.

28
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,420
Scroll down will be installing the full version of Wordpress which we can use for blogs or any other

29
00:01:45,420 --> 00:01:46,520
web site.

30
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,070
So the only option we need to put in is where we want to install WordPress so you may have already uploaded

31
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:56,030
some files to your hosting package.

32
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:02,190
So if you have I'd recommend installing WordPress in a subdomain so that can be anything you like it

33
00:02:02,190 --> 00:02:06,810
could be a blog or web site or whatever but I'm going to call it WordPress.

34
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,740
So just put web person that the slash at the end is optional but then click Install now and what that

35
00:02:13,740 --> 00:02:19,440
actually does is creates a database and some P-H piece scripts which will be looking at in the next

36
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:27,940
section to allow WordPress to run on your site so that you can complete the install process.

37
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:31,670
Now the first link will only work if you've purchased the domain.

38
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:35,860
If you haven't purchased the domain name you'll need to use the temporary u r l.

39
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:37,530
That is the second link.

40
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:46,670
And that will work regardless of whether or not you've purchased the domain name right.

41
00:02:46,690 --> 00:02:51,900
So if everything is going well you should see this WordPress installation page.

42
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,150
It's fairly straightforward.

43
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,770
You just put your site title.

44
00:02:55,770 --> 00:02:56,490
So I'm going to put.

45
00:02:56,490 --> 00:02:57,780
Example.

46
00:02:58,290 --> 00:03:00,920
WordPress site.

47
00:03:00,940 --> 00:03:06,810
But you can put whatever you like then use a name for replaceable.

48
00:03:06,850 --> 00:03:09,850
Again you can put whatever you like and then password.

49
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:12,790
So I've caught one automatically generated for me here.

50
00:03:12,930 --> 00:03:14,190
I'll leave that as it is.

51
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:17,450
And then your email address.

52
00:03:17,530 --> 00:03:20,560
Rob Percival Tokarev UK.

53
00:03:21,060 --> 00:03:25,080
If for some reason you want to switch off search engines then you can do that but probably you're going

54
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:26,470
to want people to find your site.

55
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:31,520
I would leave that text and then you just press install WordPress.

56
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:34,560
If you got last past caring it might remember your password.

57
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:37,840
So I will just do that

58
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:45,900
and then you log in.

59
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:48,280
Hopefully you remember the password.

60
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:54,100
I've got last boss here so I'm going to pop that in.

61
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:55,800
It's got the user name wrong.

62
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:58,510
I will just put his name and password that you entered.

63
00:03:58,510 --> 00:04:06,940
Remember me if you want to be remembered on this machine and then log in and this will take you to the

64
00:04:06,940 --> 00:04:08,340
Wordpress dashboard.

65
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:14,240
And this is where we're going to start looking through the functionality of Wordpress in the next video.

66
00:04:14,260 --> 00:04:14,930
See you there.
