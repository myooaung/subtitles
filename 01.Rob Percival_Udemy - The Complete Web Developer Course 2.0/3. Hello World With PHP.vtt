00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:06.190
So as BHP is a service side language we need to run it on a web server.

2
00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:12.380
We can't just use the text editor and the browser like we have for HCM El CSX and JavaScript and J.

3
00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.460
Query.

4
00:00:13.460 --> 00:00:19.550
So if you haven't set up your free web hosting yet then jump to the Web hosting setup section and go

5
00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:21.980
through the process to do that.

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:23.090
Well done.

7
00:00:23.090 --> 00:00:23.740
Great.

8
00:00:23.740 --> 00:00:24.060
Okay.

9
00:00:24.680 --> 00:00:32.860
So now you should be able to go to Fire FTB and to connect to your website and connect to your Web site.

10
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:33.740
And that's what I've done here.

11
00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:37.400
So I'm on complete web developer course dot com slash content.

12
00:00:37.410 --> 00:00:39.200
There's my previous sections.

13
00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:40.790
This is our new section.

14
00:00:40.790 --> 00:00:55.590
So I'm going to create a directory and we'll call this six dash BHP so that our next section missing

15
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:01.490
out WordPress because we didn't save anything on this section for that and then I'm going to double

16
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:13.260
click to go into six dash BHP and then I'm going to create a file and I'm going to call this index top

17
00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:23.080
BHP so remember the dot BHP extension means that we'll be able to run BHP scripts on this file if we

18
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.500
had to CML then it won't recognize the BHP by default and I'll show you in a minute why we use index

19
00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.540
top BHP rather than any other name.

20
00:01:31.550 --> 00:01:37.820
There's a particular advantage to using that file name so then I'm going to right click or control click

21
00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:43.890
and open and that will open up index stop BHP in brackets.

22
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:47.730
It should open up in your chosen text editor.

23
00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:52.390
If you've set that up as instructed in the hosting setup section.

24
00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:53.300
All right.

25
00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:57.350
So just to check that everything's connected and working I'm going to have just a simple not quite a

26
00:01:57.350 --> 00:01:57.980
Hello World.

27
00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:06.320
We're not there yet but just some text and then I'm going to go over in my browser and open that up.

28
00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:16.400
So remember this was complete web developer called dot com slash content slash six dash P HP and then

29
00:02:16.610 --> 00:02:19.860
index dot P. HP.

30
00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:23.210
So if we jumped to there we should get Hi there.

31
00:02:23.270 --> 00:02:24.370
Fantastic.

32
00:02:24.380 --> 00:02:31.370
Now's the time to show you why this index stop BHP file is a good file name and that's if we get rid

33
00:02:31.370 --> 00:02:39.020
of the file name completely and reload that you can see we still get that content and that's because

34
00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:45.560
the index file name by default displays if there's no file name at all.

35
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:50.000
So if you want your Web site to display a complete web developer course dot com slash blog for example

36
00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:55.030
then if you called your main file indexed top BHP then that would just work.

37
00:02:55.160 --> 00:02:57.510
It works as well for indexed or HDL.

38
00:02:57.980 --> 00:03:04.960
So generally the main page of the home page of your site will be called index dot BHP or HDL.

39
00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.210
If you're not using BHP so that's why we use index top BHP.

40
00:03:08.210 --> 00:03:13.650
You can of course use a different name if you like but we'll stick with our index.

41
00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:23.030
And now then it's time to run our first bit of BHP so remember with JavaScript we had to use the script

42
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:31.250
tag with a type of text slash javascript and then inside our script tags was where we put all our javascript.

43
00:03:31.250 --> 00:03:35.090
So this was an indication that we were going to start some javascript.

44
00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:44.180
We have a similar setup for PSP but instead of using script tags we use the less than symbol and then

45
00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:51.830
a question mark and then BHP and that's the the universal symbol for right we're gonna start writing

46
00:03:51.830 --> 00:04:01.820
some BHP code now and then when we're done writing our BHP code we use a question mark and a greater

47
00:04:01.820 --> 00:04:02.720
than sign.

48
00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:10.080
So this means start BHP and this means end BHP one of the most common mistakes I see early programmers

49
00:04:10.100 --> 00:04:16.880
making is putting text or HDMI all inside these HP tags and that won't work.

50
00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:24.690
So you need to put your HMO outside of those tax not inside them.

51
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.130
OK.

52
00:04:26.420 --> 00:04:29.110
So how do we get Hallowell to appear in BHP.

53
00:04:29.240 --> 00:04:34.250
Of course if we try and do something like that that's not valid BHP.

54
00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:39.650
So we'll get a nasty error of some sort of 500 error in this case or occasionally if you've got an error

55
00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:42.890
the script just won't run and you'll get a blank page.

56
00:04:42.890 --> 00:04:48.500
So if we want to display hello world we have to give the page code an instruction to print it.

57
00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:57.470
And the function for that NPA HP is echo so echo essentially means display on the page you could imagine

58
00:04:57.470 --> 00:05:04.160
it being an echo in from the script to the user's page and then we put the thing that we want to echo

59
00:05:04.580 --> 00:05:06.920
in quotes like that.

60
00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:13.930
And unlike javascript BHP insists on semicolons if you don't put a semicolon at the end of your line

61
00:05:14.030 --> 00:05:15.850
it won't run.

62
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:18.090
So you have to put semicolons.

63
00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.740
That then is your first line of valid BHP.

64
00:05:20.870 --> 00:05:22.030
Let's just have a look.

65
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:23.300
Excellent.

66
00:05:23.300 --> 00:05:23.750
There we go.

67
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.820
So that's your Hallowell then BHP.

68
00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:32.720
And essentially anytime you want to display some HDMI or text using BHP used echo and then surround

69
00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:36.050
what you want to display in quotes.

70
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:36.440
All right.

71
00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:42.820
So we're now going to go on and look at the key programming constructs in HP starting with variables.

72
00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:47.930
But just before we do that I'm going to show you one very important thing when you're learning BHP and

73
00:05:47.930 --> 00:05:50.480
that's how to display error messages.

74
00:05:50.570 --> 00:05:58.490
So if for example I forget the double quote at the end of hello world and we try to run the script we'll

75
00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.380
get a server error.

76
00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:03.160
So just like with JavaScript it won't run the code at all.

77
00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:06.400
If you've got a big bunch of code it can then be quite tricky to work out.

78
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:11.410
The error is and to do that we have to create a new file.

79
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:19.160
So go back to fire FTB and then control or right click and create file and this new file is going to

80
00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:23.180
be called P HP dot any.

81
00:06:23.310 --> 00:06:27.730
So it's a slightly different kind of file it's not a BHP file it's in any file.

82
00:06:27.810 --> 00:06:32.520
So essentially it contains the initialization options for BHP.

83
00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:41.400
So when HP runs your script we can put various options in the HP dot any file and then we open that

84
00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:47.100
up in the usual way and we want to set two variables here.

85
00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:59.130
The first one is error underscore reporting and we want to set that equal to e underscore pull and that

86
00:06:59.130 --> 00:07:07.040
essentially says we want to report on all types of errors and we don't put a semicolon at the end of

87
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:09.450
the line here because we're not writing normal BHP.

88
00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:13.430
We're writing dot any code doesn't require the semicolon.

89
00:07:13.430 --> 00:07:21.020
Then the other variable we want to set is display underscore errors and we want to set that equal to

90
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:32.800
on so those two variables combined will allow us to see the errors on our script when we run it.

91
00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:37.620
I should say that although it's a very good idea to display errors when you're developing a site it's

92
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:43.260
a very bad idea to display errors on a site which is being used in production because if something goes

93
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:48.660
wrong on your site hackers might be able to use the error messages to get access to your database or

94
00:07:48.780 --> 00:07:53.820
your file system or something secure they feel free to turn Arizona while you're developing but then

95
00:07:53.850 --> 00:07:58.970
remember to turn them off again when your site is done and it's out in the wild.

96
00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.030
Okay so we don't need to edit that anymore so I'm just gonna close that down and then let's put an error

97
00:08:06.030 --> 00:08:08.960
into our code and see what happens now.

98
00:08:14.050 --> 00:08:18.760
So it doesn't look beautiful but it's definitely better than the 500 error that we had before and it's

99
00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.170
actually reasonably precise.

100
00:08:20.170 --> 00:08:27.000
We've got a pass error so the script was unable to be passed that is understood by the computer.

101
00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:34.620
And we've got a syntax error unexpected end of file expected variable or this or that on line 6.

102
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:39.700
Often this variable this message Sorry won't be particularly useful.

103
00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:40.580
Sometimes it will.

104
00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:47.020
Is really useful is the line number although it's not quite as useful as you might think because you

105
00:08:47.020 --> 00:08:51.820
might be slightly confused here it says the error is on line 6 which is here but we can clearly see

106
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:53.630
the error is on line 3.

107
00:08:53.650 --> 00:08:59.200
Now the reason it's coming up with the error on line 6 is because we haven't actually got an error as

108
00:08:59.200 --> 00:09:08.410
yet here because what we could do is close the quotes down there and if we did that everything would

109
00:09:08.410 --> 00:09:16.860
be fine let's have a look you see we just get the semicolon as part of our code which is echoed.

110
00:09:16.920 --> 00:09:24.090
So the error doesn't actually appear until we try and P HP which we do on line 6 and it says wait a

111
00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:34.350
minute we can't NPA HP because we haven't closed this quote here so don't necessarily spend ages scouring

112
00:09:34.410 --> 00:09:41.560
the particular line that the compiler gives you the error message on because it might be that the error

113
00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:46.720
is on the line before that line or maybe even one or two lines before that line depending on how your

114
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.590
code is set up.

115
00:09:48.190 --> 00:09:52.240
So that's a bit of a warning for you but generally a message like this is going to be much more useful

116
00:09:52.270 --> 00:09:56.880
than the just plain 500 error as we saw beforehand.

117
00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.030
So I definitely recommend setting up error reporting as you're developing your site and definitely as

118
00:10:01.030 --> 00:10:05.540
you're learning HP as well because it'll help you with the challenges and you inevitably make mistakes.

119
00:10:05.650 --> 00:10:09.510
It will show you at least reasonably accurately where you've gone wrong.

120
00:10:09.520 --> 00:10:09.840
All right.

121
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:14.060
So now we're set up and running with BHP showing us a nice error messages.

122
00:10:14.050 --> 00:10:19.030
We're now going to work our way through the basic programming constructs in BHP starting in the next

123
00:10:19.030 --> 00:10:20.350
video with variables.
