00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:05.250
Now that you're familiar with the Wordpress press dashboard Let's take a look at how themes work with

2
00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.800
Wordpress and how we can use them to customize the look of our site and create a great looking Web site

3
00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:12.180
very quickly.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:19.620
So like with the plugin ecosystem WordPress has a huge theme ecosystem which we can see at Wordpress

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:23.700
dot org slash themes.

6
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:27.020
Now all of the themes on WordPress org are completely free.

7
00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:35.610
So any of these we can recreate with the touch of a button we can also look at the most popular themes

8
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:37.740
to get an idea.

9
00:00:38.280 --> 00:00:45.030
Of what some of the best themes might be and we can search by filter as well so we can look for specific

10
00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:52.900
color schemes specific layouts specific features or subjects or even just search for a general topic.

11
00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:59.250
So for example we were looking for a business theme that we could search for those and add whichever

12
00:00:59.250 --> 00:01:04.410
one we like the look of we can do that within WordPress itself.

13
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:11.340
So anything that we find on here we can search for within WordPress.

14
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:22.130
So to add a new theme we click Add in the Word Press appearance themes section and then we get all of

15
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:29.510
the search options that we just saw on wordpress to the org and we get a bunch of the most popular themes

16
00:01:29.510 --> 00:01:30.560
as well.

17
00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:38.480
I'm going to for the moment choose Zera light and we'll just see how we can customize this particular

18
00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:42.260
theme as an example.

19
00:01:42.290 --> 00:01:47.570
So just like with plugins and updates we can install themes without having to download any files.

20
00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:53.330
We can just click activate them and then that will make the theme happen.

21
00:01:53.330 --> 00:01:57.920
We can use live preview if you want to see what it looks like we're actually making it live.

22
00:01:58.190 --> 00:02:01.610
But as we're just developing we might as well go for the whole thing.

23
00:02:01.910 --> 00:02:07.060
So you can see that that's changed the look of our site but it hasn't changed the content already though.

24
00:02:07.070 --> 00:02:08.700
I think it looks a lot nicer.

25
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:11.020
So once you've chosen your theme it's time to get to work.

26
00:02:11.020 --> 00:02:12.880
Customizing it.

27
00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:21.730
So this particular theme has a get started link which has an F FAA cue about how to do various things

28
00:02:22.120 --> 00:02:24.050
which is one of the things I like about it.

29
00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.180
Some themes will have this some won't.

30
00:02:26.530 --> 00:02:30.400
But it also has some actions required to set it up.

31
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:31.990
So let's follow those steps.

32
00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:38.930
So first off a flight like a lot of things come comes with a home page template.

33
00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:44.700
But to see that we need to change the reading settings to your latest posts.

34
00:02:44.890 --> 00:02:54.510
So you might remember we change that to show our particular page.

35
00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:59.430
So we'll just change that back to front page displays.

36
00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:12.090
Latest posts say changes and then we'll do a refresh and we should now see the default Zera if home

37
00:03:12.090 --> 00:03:16.190
page and there we get.

38
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:22.100
So you can see this might not be the sort of site that we're looking for but if it is we do have something

39
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:26.490
that looks pretty impressive just from a couple of clicks.

40
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:29.180
We're going to want to customize the content here.

41
00:03:29.450 --> 00:03:31.990
So let's see how we do that.

42
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:37.760
We'll get back to appearance and about Zera flight and actions required.

43
00:03:37.870 --> 00:03:46.700
So some themes that come with specific plug ins and this one requests that we install pirate forms which

44
00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:52.260
is a particular form plug in that makes the form set up management process much easier.

45
00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:55.950
So I'm just going to go through the process and activate that particular plug in.

46
00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:02.970
And then let's go back to about Zera flight and see if we've done all the set up steps up we still got

47
00:04:02.970 --> 00:04:04.450
one more thing to go.

48
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:09.740
So that's actually just check that the contact form is working.

49
00:04:10.170 --> 00:04:12.110
So it will refresh and make sure it looks good

50
00:04:16.990 --> 00:04:17.420
there we go.

51
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:21.200
It looks really nice if we want to customize that form.

52
00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:28.620
Then once you install a plug in then usually under settings you'll see an option for that new plug in.

53
00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:35.990
So I get to settings and pirate forms and then we can see how to add our form to any page we just use

54
00:04:36.050 --> 00:04:37.210
that code.

55
00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:40.440
This is known as a short code and quite a few plug ins use this.

56
00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:48.260
So square brackets with some words inside to produce some content in this case a form and then we've

57
00:04:48.260 --> 00:04:49.300
got various options.

58
00:04:49.370 --> 00:04:54.340
So if I was going to use this I'd definitely want to change the email address.

59
00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.780
There are some other options I can change which fields are displayed and whether or not they required

60
00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:02.310
the labels for those fields.

61
00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:09.410
The messages that will be sent and any S-M T.P. settings if I want to use a particular email server

62
00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:11.200
to send your e-mails.

63
00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:19.990
All right so now that we've set up the pirate forms let's go back to parents and click on customize.

64
00:05:20.150 --> 00:05:23.090
So pretty much everything will have a bunch of options.

65
00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:27.100
And most of those will edit through the Wordpress customize.

66
00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:31.460
Now the great thing about this is that we can see the results of the changes that we make immediately

67
00:05:31.850 --> 00:05:34.100
before they're even published on the site.

68
00:05:34.610 --> 00:05:39.050
So if we click for example site identity then we could upload a logo.

69
00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:46.520
We can change the title and the tag line and we can upload an icon which is what appears in the browser

70
00:05:46.520 --> 00:05:47.430
tab up there.

71
00:05:47.630 --> 00:05:48.290
If we wanted to

72
00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:58.340
OK changing the section order and colors in this case is only available on the pro version of the theme.

73
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:02.540
And if you like this theme it's well worth buying the prairie version but we'll stick to the free options

74
00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:03.610
for the moment.

75
00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:11.720
So general settings you might want to change these to increase the performance of the sites or the scrolling

76
00:06:11.730 --> 00:06:16.150
behavior or indeed the accessibility and copyright.

77
00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:23.750
We could put whatever we like in there and then it will appear right down there at the bottom.

78
00:06:23.750 --> 00:06:28.040
If we wanted to put the copyright symbol we can use the H Tim L code.

79
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:32.760
Ampersand copy semi-colon and there it is

80
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:43.620
OK we can also edit the footer social icons so you could put in your own Facebook Twitter Linked-In

81
00:06:43.970 --> 00:06:48.930
be Hans dribble and Instagram links and if you don't want them to appear if you don't have a dribble

82
00:06:48.930 --> 00:06:53.390
account for example you can just make them blank and then they'll disappear.

83
00:06:56.240 --> 00:07:03.060
We can also change the footer content here so you can add your address the address icon.

84
00:07:03.350 --> 00:07:06.940
And similarly for the email section and the phone number.

85
00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.160
Now the special Tref here it's got a TTL in front of it.

86
00:07:11.360 --> 00:07:15.830
And that means that if you click on that on your phone it will actually phone that number.

87
00:07:16.470 --> 00:07:17.050
OK.

88
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:24.300
So that's the footer options I'm going to speed through the rest of the options.

89
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:28.690
So here we can edit the title on the home page

90
00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:36.460
something like that.

91
00:07:39.350 --> 00:07:41.450
We can change what those links say

92
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:49.390
and where they go as well.

93
00:07:53.010 --> 00:08:00.390
We can add extra images to the slide up and if we've got the pro version we can have a background video

94
00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:03.030
here as well.

95
00:08:03.030 --> 00:08:05.650
And then we can edit the particular sections.

96
00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:12.670
So here we've got our focus.

97
00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.180
So the title is currently features.

98
00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:18.040
And then you've got a subtitle here.

99
00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:29.340
And again you can edit it live and you can choose to hide that particular section if you want as well.

100
00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:39.850
And you could edit each of these content blocks just by changing the title text where you want the links

101
00:08:39.850 --> 00:08:43.740
to go and the logo image.

102
00:08:43.750 --> 00:08:46.510
That's all pretty straightforward.

103
00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:48.920
The other sections then work in a very similar way.

104
00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:54.120
So we might look at those specifically but we've got the About section which we can edit all of that's

105
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.070
your team section.

106
00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:01.430
Again we can customize that and hide it if we don't want it.

107
00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:04.170
Testimonials as well we can hide that.

108
00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.390
And then the latest news is where our blog posts will go.

109
00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:12.800
If we've got any then we've got the contact form.

110
00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:20.420
And then we can change the background image for the contact form section.

111
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:25.040
And I'm actually going to look at menus and widgets on a separate page so we won't look at those here

112
00:09:25.370 --> 00:09:30.350
and the static front page up just allows us to use our own page rather than this one as the home page

113
00:09:30.350 --> 00:09:31.140
if we want to.

114
00:09:31.370 --> 00:09:33.780
So not all themes will have all of those options.

115
00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:39.240
Some will have different options but all of them will have a customized that allows you to edit colour's

116
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:40.420
content.

117
00:09:40.780 --> 00:09:41.380
OK.

118
00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:43.700
So we're nearly there with our customizing.

119
00:09:43.700 --> 00:09:48.660
We're going to go back and just look at two more sections in appearance which are going to be relevant

120
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:50.960
Scarlet's of which theme you're working with.

121
00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:54.700
And the first of those is widgets here.

122
00:09:54.890 --> 00:09:59.610
Now most WordPress themes have two main sections for widgets.

123
00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:06.600
They have a sidebar which isn't actually visible here but other pages may well have it if I click some

124
00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:11.630
sample page for example that will jump to the sample page and you can see the sidebar here.

125
00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:15.260
And they also have a footer along the bottom.

126
00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:19.280
And usually you can edit the sidebar and the footer using widgets.

127
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:25.400
So here you can see we've got all these widgets in our Sidebar at the top we've got a search bar which

128
00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:33.740
is there and then we've got our recent posts which we can customize and give a particular title to comments

129
00:10:33.830 --> 00:10:36.900
archive's categories et cetera.

130
00:10:36.930 --> 00:10:42.070
So say we didn't want to give a metal section we could just delete that.

131
00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.830
And say instead of that we wanted to put some text at the bottom

132
00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:53.160
of our site but

133
00:10:58.100 --> 00:11:00.260
then we can just add a text widget

134
00:11:11.430 --> 00:11:13.920
and put in any HMO we like

135
00:11:17.630 --> 00:11:19.910
let's just have a quick refresh.

136
00:11:20.090 --> 00:11:20.870
There it is.

137
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:25.130
So there's our text and our text or email.

138
00:11:25.370 --> 00:11:29.810
So if there are custom things that you want to put in the sidebar like log in forms or something like

139
00:11:29.810 --> 00:11:30.280
that.

140
00:11:30.410 --> 00:11:33.090
Then there are plugins to allow you to do that.

141
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:40.950
But most themes will also come with a set of widgets like the Zera ones here as well.

142
00:11:43.770 --> 00:11:51.940
And then we can do the same thing in the footer So currently the footer section is blank but we could

143
00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:55.370
put an extra widget in there if we like.

144
00:11:56.020 --> 00:12:03.400
And then that will appear in the footer various superbly aligned would have to do a bit of work to make

145
00:12:03.400 --> 00:12:05.740
that look good but you get the idea.

146
00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:10.930
So widgets are how you customize the sidebar and the footer.

147
00:12:11.530 --> 00:12:15.670
And the last major bit of customization you're probably going to want to do is to play around with the

148
00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:17.280
menus.

149
00:12:17.380 --> 00:12:20.550
So some themes will have a number of different menus.

150
00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.500
We can see that this one has just a single menu along the top there.

151
00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:35.660
And the nice thing about menus in wordpress is that if we add a new page say just click Add new and

152
00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:38.410
then we might have an About Us page

153
00:12:43.950 --> 00:12:49.380
so I can just create there and publish see how quickly and easy it is to create a new page.

154
00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:55.420
Then not only do we then have that new page but it will automatically appear in the menu up here as

155
00:12:55.420 --> 00:12:55.880
well.

156
00:12:57.730 --> 00:12:58.800
So that's really handy.

157
00:12:58.870 --> 00:13:05.060
But if we want to customize our menus then we can edit that here.

158
00:13:05.080 --> 00:13:09.480
So say for example we don't want the sample page to appear in the menu.

159
00:13:09.690 --> 00:13:12.350
Just remove it there.

160
00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:20.160
We could also change that name that appears or change anything we like about that menu.

161
00:13:20.170 --> 00:13:22.270
We can also create a new menu if we want.

162
00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.150
And then it might appear in the footer for example or in the sidebar.

163
00:13:26.710 --> 00:13:28.170
All fairly straightforward.

164
00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:34.150
The last thing I want to show you about appearance is the editor here and we'll leave that page we won't

165
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:35.470
save our changes.

166
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.810
Now this is where the real coding gets done.

167
00:13:40.810 --> 00:13:48.880
So this is the theme code here which is mostly Page Pate but we've got a lot of styles as well.

168
00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:55.120
And this is where you would edit the theme if you want to do some custom restyling or changing the content

169
00:13:55.150 --> 00:13:58.270
in a way that you can't do using the customize or the widgets.

170
00:13:58.270 --> 00:14:00.550
Be aware though it's easy to break stuff.

171
00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:04.510
So why take a backup of your site before you start editing these files.

172
00:14:04.510 --> 00:14:05.170
All right.

173
00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:10.870
So PC then that had zero cost and just a few minutes of your time you can create a completely custom

174
00:14:10.870 --> 00:14:18.390
site which looks good is robust and is easily editable by someone who doesn't know any code.

175
00:14:18.580 --> 00:14:24.160
Sometimes you're going to find that the free themes either don't offer the exact look that you want

176
00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:31.090
or just a not quite good enough for you to use for a site of your own or make for a client.

177
00:14:31.210 --> 00:14:34.310
And the next stage up from that then are paid things.

178
00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:37.060
And if you're wanting to make a site look really good.

179
00:14:37.180 --> 00:14:39.370
I would go straight to page themes.

180
00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:47.310
There are lots of places to get them but the biggest directory of page themes on line today is theme

181
00:14:47.350 --> 00:14:51.550
forest dot net and they've got a bunch of themes for all sorts of platforms.

182
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:55.300
But we're particularly interested in the Wordpress ones.

183
00:14:56.190 --> 00:14:56.980
So I pay themes.

184
00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:59.480
Normally around 50 60 dollars.

185
00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:04.690
They're not big money and the amount of time and effort that they'll save you and the higher quality

186
00:15:04.690 --> 00:15:08.110
products that you'll end up with I think they're well worth it.

187
00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:16.650
So if we look as the best sellers and I'll just switch to the great view so we can get more on the screen

188
00:15:17.790 --> 00:15:23.680
than any of these very popular themes are likely to work really well for you.

189
00:15:23.750 --> 00:15:27.600
So if we hover over them then we can get a preview of how they look.

190
00:15:28.980 --> 00:15:35.310
Now the nice thing about the most popular themes is that they tend to have a range of different looks

191
00:15:35.370 --> 00:15:36.600
and styles.

192
00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:39.900
So you buy the theme as a whole but then

193
00:15:42.670 --> 00:15:47.590
you can customize it to such an extent that you could make a whole range of different looking sites

194
00:15:47.710 --> 00:15:49.180
using the same theme.

195
00:15:49.180 --> 00:15:54.470
Bear in mind though you will usually have to buy a separate copy of the theme for each site.

196
00:15:55.060 --> 00:16:00.970
So in short if you want to get good looking WordPress websites up quickly my advice would be to choose

197
00:16:01.150 --> 00:16:07.600
a premium WordPress theme that offers a range of different styles and become an expert in that particular

198
00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:08.120
theme.

199
00:16:08.140 --> 00:16:13.450
That will mean that you can use the various settings options and customization potential really quickly

200
00:16:13.690 --> 00:16:17.100
and get something that looks great up really fast.

201
00:16:17.230 --> 00:16:19.640
And although all of these themes will offer a great experience.

202
00:16:19.660 --> 00:16:23.560
The one that I'm going to work through with you is the X theme.

203
00:16:23.830 --> 00:16:32.920
So let's have a quick look at what the X does like all theme voice themes we can use live preview to

204
00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.360
take a look at it in action.

205
00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:37.950
Just remove that frame so we can see the whole thing.

206
00:16:40.310 --> 00:16:47.660
So you can see we've got a great looking site first off but we've got a number of sub themes within

207
00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:48.540
the main theme.

208
00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:54.020
So integrity is the first option which is the more sort of business a looking site.

209
00:16:54.320 --> 00:17:03.470
Renew is another more flat design icon for blogs and online magazines and ethos for more stylish looking

210
00:17:03.470 --> 00:17:05.670
sites like this country living one here.

211
00:17:07.770 --> 00:17:13.260
But where it gets really exciting is when we look at the huge range of demos that are available.

212
00:17:13.260 --> 00:17:17.420
And I'm just going to click just a few of these open them in a browser.

213
00:17:17.430 --> 00:17:21.710
So there are 10 or so demos for each of the main themes.

214
00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:27.710
And each of the themes supports with commerce an online shop which we'll be looking at in a couple of

215
00:17:27.710 --> 00:17:35.210
years time by the press which we saw in the previous video for social networks Web sites and beby press

216
00:17:35.330 --> 00:17:37.170
for forum type sites.

217
00:17:37.220 --> 00:17:40.070
So let's have a quick look at those demos.

218
00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:44.310
There's the integrity one.

219
00:17:44.510 --> 00:17:45.450
It's pretty good.

220
00:17:48.640 --> 00:17:55.580
That was the new theme again looks good but looks completely different.

221
00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:58.760
And then he has the icon theme as well.

222
00:18:01.390 --> 00:18:04.380
So none of those three may be perfect for your particular site.

223
00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:07.590
The chances are you'll find something in here that's pretty close to what you want.

224
00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:11.650
And all of these come with a huge range of content types as well.

225
00:18:12.010 --> 00:18:20.860
So for example if I pick another integrity demo we'll be able to use this slider on any of our sites

226
00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:25.630
and I counter like that's

227
00:18:28.820 --> 00:18:36.930
background images and buttons like this and block layouts like this.

228
00:18:38.110 --> 00:18:43.360
So while the X theme is by no means unique in offering these things I think the overall package is the

229
00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.070
most flexible that's available.

230
00:18:45.070 --> 00:18:49.480
And therefore if you're going to become an expert on one particular theme I'd go for the X theme and

231
00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:54.580
that's what we'll be using in the next few videos where we'll be creating and customizing a couple of

232
00:18:54.580 --> 00:18:57.420
completely different sites using the X theme.
