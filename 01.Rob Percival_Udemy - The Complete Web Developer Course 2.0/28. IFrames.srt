1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:06,050
OK so nearly at the end of the age DML section where we're going to be doing our big H D M L project.

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:11,040
But before we do that there's one thing I want to show you that is including content from other sites

3
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:15,820
in yours using eye frames and it's actually really easy.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:21,990
So first off let's say for example we wanted to include the Google home page for some reason in our

5
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:23,320
web page.

6
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:30,440
All we do is create an I-frame and then we set the SIRC.

7
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:34,980
So just the same as with an image to whatever we want to use.

8
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:39,360
And this time I'll use everyone's favorite web hosting sites.

9
00:00:39,630 --> 00:00:42,520
He care saying don't go to UK.

10
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:48,100
I'm actually using that because Google blocks I-frame usage of Google and it won't work.

11
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:52,480
But if we do it with web hosting it should work fine.

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,600
And there we go.

13
00:00:53,670 --> 00:00:57,180
You can see we've got the page in there it's obviously in a small box at the moment but we could change

14
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,540
the size of that with CSSA later on.

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,450
And you can interact with that Web site just in the normal way just clicking on legs etc..

16
00:01:07,220 --> 00:01:08,990
All right so that's a basic I-frame.

17
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:15,430
We can also if we want perts content from our own Web site in there.

18
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:23,560
So you remember this is an absolute link because it's got the HGT pay at the front but we had a relative

19
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,060
link as well.

20
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:28,310
So if we go back to our halo world that HDMI L

21
00:01:31,510 --> 00:01:35,000
then you can see we get the content from that page as well.

22
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,760
So this might not look like something you want to deregulate put a whole home page or different page

23
00:01:39,790 --> 00:01:44,440
in your site but it actually can be really useful if you want to use a translation service for example

24
00:01:44,440 --> 00:01:49,960
to translate words on your site could use an I-frame to get the data from that site and display it on

25
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:51,430
your web page.

26
00:01:51,820 --> 00:01:58,540
One other very common use for eye frames is including videos and embedding other media in your web site.

27
00:01:58,630 --> 00:02:03,360
And that is why you might have noticed I've got this great song from Brian Adams up on YouTube.

28
00:02:03,460 --> 00:02:05,010
It's not because I've been listening to it.

29
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:11,260
In between making videos it's because when we get to any video on YouTube and click the share button

30
00:02:11,290 --> 00:02:18,250
the Owerri then the second option along is in bed and then that gives you some code which you'll notice

31
00:02:18,340 --> 00:02:20,100
is an I-frame code.

32
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,640
So I'm going to select all of that using command or control on a PC.

33
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:31,270
Copy it to the clipboard using Komansky or Control-C and then paste it in right underneath the code

34
00:02:31,270 --> 00:02:36,730
that we've got there so that some I-frame code in the wild you can see we've got some extra attributes

35
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:42,040
that we've got a width and height setting so that the number of pixels wide and number of pixels high

36
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:49,170
and with also got a framed border equals zero setting which you're welcome to try out on these ones.

37
00:02:49,180 --> 00:02:51,760
In fact let's just pop it on there.

38
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:55,370
To have a look.

39
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:04,230
And as you can imagine that we'll get rid of the frame border and now we have a YouTube video right

40
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:09,890
there in our page and we can even listen to it right there if we want to.

41
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:14,760
Very exciting stuff.

42
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:15,170
All right.

43
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,160
So congratulations you've made it to the end of the first section of the complete web developer because

44
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:25,930
you've learned how web pages are put together with DML with headers and body tags.

45
00:03:26,010 --> 00:03:33,010
You've learned about paragraphs formatting text lists images forms tables links HTL entities.

46
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:36,490
And then finally I frames that for a lot of new information.

47
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:40,950
And as I said at the beginning of the section the best way to keep this new information in your head

48
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:43,520
is practice it as often as you possibly can.

49
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:48,090
So we're going to start that in the next video by giving you a challenge to put all of this together

50
00:03:48,350 --> 00:03:52,170
and make a fantastic first ever complete web page.
