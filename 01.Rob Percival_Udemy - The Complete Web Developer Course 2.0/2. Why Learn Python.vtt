00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:06.300
Python is a powerful fast and easy to learn computer programming language that you've probably heard

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:12.120
of but you might be wondering why we're learning a new language at this point in the course we already

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:16.860
know how to do client side programming with javascript and we know how to do service type programming

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:18.030
with HP.

5
00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.230
Why would we want to learn new languages.

6
00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:26.440
Well my reasons are conveniently summarized in this blog post on scaled up dot com.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.520
Now Python is of course not your first programming language because you've already learnt several.

8
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.360
So the fact that it's easy to learn is a bonus but not critical for you because you're already fairly

9
00:00:36.390 --> 00:00:40.420
comfortable with different programming languages.

10
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:44.180
But this is the real reason that I want to teach you some Python.

11
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:49.470
At the end of the complete web developer of course and that's that Python is a great stepping stone

12
00:00:49.470 --> 00:00:50.290
language.

13
00:00:50.290 --> 00:00:57.690
The syntax that it has is very similar to a number of key programming languages that are likely to encounter

14
00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.460
as a web developer.

15
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:07.030
So learning a little bit of Python will make learning languages like Swift Ruby or Perl much easier.

16
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:14.490
It's also your stepping stone in another way because Python can be run directly on a Raspberry Pi or

17
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:19.260
any one of the several tiny and very cheaply available computers out there.

18
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.260
So if you want to start working with the to build things like radios cameras and even pet feeders then

19
00:01:25.260 --> 00:01:27.190
Python is going to enable you to do that.

20
00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:32.910
The Internet of Things is very much an up part of technology and Python will enable you to be part of

21
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:35.080
that.

22
00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:40.910
Secondly it's definitely the case that pipe developers are more and more in demand and although HP is

23
00:01:40.910 --> 00:01:45.300
very much still the most widely used programming language it's not on the increase.

24
00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.450
Whereas Python very much is.

25
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.740
And finally as well as Python being a great link on things like Raspberry Pi You can use it on the web

26
00:01:55.280 --> 00:02:02.030
and in fact it forms the basis of the popular web framework Django which for the foundation of massive

27
00:02:02.030 --> 00:02:06.110
sites like Pinterest the New York Times and Instagram.

28
00:02:06.170 --> 00:02:08.540
So we're really just going to scratch the surface of Python.

29
00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:13.280
But I want you to know how it works so that you can be ready to use it to segue into other programming

30
00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:20.340
languages and maybe even start working on your own Raspberry Pi or Arduino based hardware projects.

31
00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:24.170
So hopefully that's convince you that Python is worth learning in the next video.

32
00:02:24.170 --> 00:02:27.330
We'll see how to get started with a Python script.
