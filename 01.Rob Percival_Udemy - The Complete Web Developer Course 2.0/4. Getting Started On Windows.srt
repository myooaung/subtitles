00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,070
On Windows there are just two pieces of software that I'd recommend you download for this course and

2
00:00:06,070 --> 00:00:11,420
they are the Chrome browser and notepad plus plus.

3
00:00:11,600 --> 00:00:21,060
So let's get chrome first on Windows just open up your browser and then type download chrome into your

4
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:22,830
browser window.

5
00:00:23,410 --> 00:00:29,130
That should get you a bunch of links which will lead to downloading chrome and that will get you to

6
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,900
this page where you click the download crame button.

7
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:38,760
It's optional whether you want to set Google Chrome as your default browser and whether you choose to

8
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:42,430
send the usage statistics as well.

9
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:49,380
The reason we're using crime is because it has great developer tools which will allow you to look at

10
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,800
the code of your pages and see what the errors are in your javascript or whatever language you're working

11
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:57,800
in at the time.

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:06,180
So once it's downloaded just click run to download the setup file say yes to allow it to make changes

13
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:07,380
on your PC.

14
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,040
And then that will go through the process of downloading the latest version of crime and installing

15
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:16,630
it on your machine as it happens.

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:20,210
I already have chrome running on my machine so I'm actually going to stop it there.

17
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:27,280
But you should just complete the installation and then you'll have chrome running on your computer to

18
00:01:27,300 --> 00:01:28,740
get crime running.

19
00:01:28,740 --> 00:01:34,950
Just click in the search box and start typing crime and there it will be.

20
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,900
If you're on a different version of Windows then it should appear on this start menu list as well.

21
00:01:43,780 --> 00:01:45,800
So this is crime if you haven't used it before.

22
00:01:45,830 --> 00:01:52,220
It works in the same way as all other Internet browsers so we can use it to download notepad.

23
00:01:52,340 --> 00:02:05,140
Plus plus there are a number of free text editors on Windows so I click download notepad plus plus I

24
00:02:05,140 --> 00:02:12,310
think is the most powerful and versatile and easy to use essentially the best one I think for people

25
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:15,280
to get started with when they're starting to carry.

26
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:21,670
So then just click the big download button and that will download it.

27
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:29,750
For you shouldn't take very long it's only four megabytes and then when that's complete click on the

28
00:02:29,750 --> 00:02:38,880
installer and this time I will go through the whole process with the click OK to select the language

29
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:43,600
and then next I agree.

30
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:46,870
Next I'd use all the default options there.

31
00:02:47,980 --> 00:02:54,210
Next And again all the different options you can change those if you want but I'm going to leave them

32
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:59,830
as they are and then we'll just let the install process do its job.

33
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:02,790
We get.

34
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:15,320
And finally it will run notepad plus plus and there we go and get an h t l file.

35
00:03:15,350 --> 00:03:22,600
I'm just going to get you started by using Save As in the File menu.

36
00:03:24,260 --> 00:03:31,970
And then I would just get started by going onto the desktop and choosing a file name like

37
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:40,830
web page dot h TNL.

38
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:50,800
And if you use the HDMI extension that will save as you directed him out page and then just clear out

39
00:03:50,800 --> 00:04:02,750
the text and use control s to save and then I'll just set you up with the view that will have for most

40
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:06,530
of this course which is the chrome browser on the left

41
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,680
if you drag that all the way over to the left.

42
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:20,880
It'll give you a beautiful split screen there with your HD M-L file on the right and chrome right there

43
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:30,100
for you on the left fantastic in the next video then we'll see how to set up your very first web page

44
00:04:30,490 --> 00:04:37,680
by creating an aged him file in your text editor and then viewing it in your browser.

45
00:04:38,020 --> 00:04:38,760
I'll see you then.
