1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:00,770
All right.

2
00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,880
So we're now going to say goodbye to Marge and get rid of our image and we're going to look at how we

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:13,080
can add forms to our web pages forms allow your pages to be interactive and the users to enter data

4
00:00:13,110 --> 00:00:14,970
tick boxes and click buttons.

5
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:17,410
So they're really powerful and really easy to use.

6
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:18,940
Let's see how we get started.

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,130
As you might guess there's a tag called form and that's what we're going to use to create our forms.

8
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,160
And then anything inside of form will be then part of that form.

9
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:37,110
So a very basic element to have in your form is an input element.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,040
Now this is one of those self-closing tags again so we don't need a closing tag.

11
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:46,170
But let's just have a look what input on its own looks like it's very simple.

12
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,540
It's just a box.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:48,130
So it's a box.

14
00:00:48,150 --> 00:00:52,100
And then you can start typing some text in there if you want to.

15
00:00:52,330 --> 00:01:01,260
So you might have something like name and then a colon and then your input and it looks like that.

16
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:05,520
Now the input tag here has several attributes that we can use.

17
00:01:05,530 --> 00:01:11,380
And the first one we'll look at is type so we can have different types of input and you can see quite

18
00:01:11,380 --> 00:01:12,900
a few of them being predicted.

19
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,160
For me there.

20
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,910
So the first one I'll just show you is not test but text.

21
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:21,040
So this is exactly what we've got.

22
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:22,630
So this is the default type.

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:28,660
But really if you're going to use an input you should use a type regardless of whether you're using

24
00:01:28,660 --> 00:01:29,980
the basic type or not.

25
00:01:29,980 --> 00:01:35,200
Just so it's clear in your code that you want this to be a text input but let's have a look then at

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,850
some of the other types of impact that we can use.

27
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:49,530
In fact we'll put that in a paragraph so that there will be on different lines so let's create another

28
00:01:49,550 --> 00:01:54,280
input with a type of.

29
00:01:54,360 --> 00:02:00,200
And we'll first look at checkbox.

30
00:02:00,290 --> 00:02:07,830
Let's see then what that looks like it's what you might guess a simple tick box.

31
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:14,210
So quite often you might see that next to for example if you're in a log in form there's often an option

32
00:02:14,210 --> 00:02:20,360
to stay logged in and then you can decide with your checkbox whether or not you want to stay logged

33
00:02:20,360 --> 00:02:22,980
in another type of input.

34
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:30,060
Is the radio input which is not necessarily so obvious as to what it is.

35
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:32,320
Let's take a look.

36
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:37,650
You will definitely have seen them while going round the web.

37
00:02:38,360 --> 00:02:44,510
So it's very similar to a checkbooks But the difference is with each set of radio buttons you can only

38
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:46,460
select one of them.

39
00:02:46,460 --> 00:02:58,340
So for example you might want to have one that says under-rating and then another that says overwriting

40
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:04,700
like that.

41
00:03:04,900 --> 00:03:09,550
Of course you could have a whole string of different sets of ages and they would only be able to check

42
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:10,440
one of those.

43
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,220
Now if you try that however at the moment we can select both.

44
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,780
And that's because we haven't linked these up in any way our code doesn't know that these are part of

45
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:26,250
the same set of radio buttons and we can link them up by giving them a name.

46
00:03:26,830 --> 00:03:32,170
So we might say age.

47
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:38,560
So now that they both have the same name if we now see how it works if we click one and then select

48
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,090
the other you can see we can only select one of them.

49
00:03:41,380 --> 00:03:46,060
And again if we had a whole string of these we would only be able to select one of them if they all

50
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,770
had the name age.

51
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:52,930
And in fact later on when we do more work with forms we'll see that pretty much every form elements

52
00:03:52,930 --> 00:03:58,380
should have a name so that you can refer to it and do something with it when the user submits the form.

53
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:01,630
But to do that you need a little bit more coding knowledge than we have at the moment.

54
00:04:01,630 --> 00:04:07,690
So we'll get that when we come to the next element We'll look at is the drop down and this actually

55
00:04:07,690 --> 00:04:13,820
works differently it's not an input it's a select.

56
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:15,870
So let's see how this works.

57
00:04:15,940 --> 00:04:17,940
You can see we've got a select tag there.

58
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:25,850
And then inside the tag we have our options.

59
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:31,270
So let's say for example that we want to get the favorite food

60
00:04:33,970 --> 00:04:34,780
of our user.

61
00:04:34,930 --> 00:04:37,200
And yes I am spelling that with you.

62
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:40,370
And let's just get out tabs looking nice.

63
00:04:40,420 --> 00:04:42,280
This is our first long bit of code.

64
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:48,350
So it starts becoming more important that we set up our tabs nicely you can see that's nice and clear

65
00:04:48,370 --> 00:04:51,540
now that everything here is inside these paragraph tags.

66
00:04:51,700 --> 00:04:56,060
And then there's the option tags are inside the select tags as well.

67
00:04:56,200 --> 00:04:59,050
So let's pop a few foods in there.

68
00:05:00,330 --> 00:05:00,810
Pizza

69
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:06,900
we'll have ice cream

70
00:05:12,030 --> 00:05:15,070
and sandwiches.

71
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:17,220
I sure do.

72
00:05:17,660 --> 00:05:19,470
So let's see what that looks like.

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:25,490
So you can see we've got a nice drop down there and the user can select whichever one they want.

74
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:27,520
Fantastic.

75
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:30,200
The last one I'm going to show you is the submit button.

76
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:34,690
So most forms are going to need this for the user to tell you that they finished.

77
00:05:35,350 --> 00:05:47,240
So that's just another input type and all we need to do is have a type of submit just like that.

78
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,820
And then let's have a look and then we got a nice submit button at the bottom that said this is a really

79
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:55,460
nice basic form that uses several different elements.

80
00:05:55,460 --> 00:05:56,930
We've got a text input.

81
00:05:57,020 --> 00:05:59,930
We've got a checkbox we've got a pair of radio buttons.

82
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:01,940
We've got to select or drop down.

83
00:06:02,090 --> 00:06:04,320
And then we've got a submit button at the bottom.

84
00:06:04,340 --> 00:06:08,750
There are of course some other form elements but these are the basic ones that you are using over and

85
00:06:08,750 --> 00:06:09,540
over again.

86
00:06:09,710 --> 00:06:13,860
Before we move on I'm just going to show you a little bit how to customize some of these.

87
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,920
So for example we might not want the submit button to have the word submit on it we might want it to

88
00:06:18,920 --> 00:06:22,070
have a different value or text.

89
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:32,310
And we do that using value to the value attribute so we might want to have click me something like that

90
00:06:32,460 --> 00:06:36,690
and that then changes the text on the button.

91
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:40,520
The value attribute can actually be used in most of these as well.

92
00:06:40,530 --> 00:06:47,560
So for example we might want to set a default username for some reason if we wanted to do that.

93
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,080
We just put it in

94
00:06:53,210 --> 00:07:00,560
has a value attribute on the user input like that and then it would appear there and the user can get

95
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:00,900
rid of it.

96
00:07:00,920 --> 00:07:02,090
If they want to.

97
00:07:02,660 --> 00:07:07,340
Similarly we could add a value attribute to the radio buttons.

98
00:07:07,460 --> 00:07:10,670
So that code will know which one they've checked.

99
00:07:10,670 --> 00:07:12,730
So we might have something like value.

100
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:20,560
He was under 18 and value equals over 18.

101
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:24,970
And then later on when we write some code to process that we'd know which one had been selected by the

102
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:26,500
user.

103
00:07:26,680 --> 00:07:32,440
Now setting the value of username into your username isn't particularly useful because most people are

104
00:07:32,440 --> 00:07:36,680
then going to have to click their select it delete it and then enter their username.

105
00:07:36,670 --> 00:07:40,290
So that's not a great way of guiding your users to do something.

106
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:46,210
But if you do want to give the users a hint as to what to type in the box you can use the placeholder

107
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:47,510
attribute.

108
00:07:48,110 --> 00:07:50,140
Let's just have a look and see what that does.

109
00:07:50,140 --> 00:07:53,290
So it still puts your user name in there but you can see it's a bit faded.

110
00:07:53,290 --> 00:07:58,010
And then when you click in the box and you can just start typing Rob.

111
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,080
And that disappears straight away.

112
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,810
So if you want to give the user a bit of guidance as to what to put in the box then the placeholder

113
00:08:04,810 --> 00:08:06,630
attribute is a great way to do that.

114
00:08:06,970 --> 00:08:07,290
All right.

115
00:08:07,300 --> 00:08:13,360
Two more things first off we might want to have this checkbox selected by default and we can do that

116
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:20,630
really easily by putting the word checked into the checkbox input as an attribute.

117
00:08:20,660 --> 00:08:22,810
It doesn't actually have a value just says checked.

118
00:08:22,870 --> 00:08:26,630
And then we have a list you can say it's checked by default.

119
00:08:27,100 --> 00:08:32,990
And finally we can change which one of the three options appears as the default.

120
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:35,510
So you can see pizza re-appears because it's at the top there.

121
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:41,980
But if I want ice cream to appear as the default when the user loads the page I just put an option of

122
00:08:42,340 --> 00:08:43,960
selected in there.

123
00:08:45,790 --> 00:08:52,630
And it's now have a look can the ice cream appears as the default one and that's it there for now.

124
00:08:52,630 --> 00:08:58,210
Obviously your form doesn't do anything when you click before me you can see the page is reloaded but

125
00:08:58,210 --> 00:09:02,440
we haven't written any code to actually process the form in any way and we'll do that later on in the

126
00:09:02,440 --> 00:09:03,360
course.

127
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:08,020
But you've learned about several different HDMI elements and put them all together to make your first

128
00:09:08,020 --> 00:09:08,980
form.

129
00:09:08,980 --> 00:09:09,810
Congratulations.

130
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:13,060
We're going to move on now to look at tables in HD M-L.
