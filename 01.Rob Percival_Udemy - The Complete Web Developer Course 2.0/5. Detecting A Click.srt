1
00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,580
Rights and other with set up with Jay queery we're going to use it to detect a click much in the same

2
00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:10,530
way that we did with javascript but we'll see Thursley how the syntax.

3
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:16,650
That is the code itself is a lot simpler but also how we can be a lot more flexible with the sort of

4
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:18,900
thing that we can click on.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:21,830
So first off very quick mini CSSA challenge for you.

6
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:29,280
Can you create a green circle and two red squares using divs and see.

7
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:30,270
Go for it.

8
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,340
All right I hope you managed it.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:47,010
I'm going to create a div with an ID of circle because there's only one circle and then I'm going to

10
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:55,780
create a div with a class of square because there are going to be two squares

11
00:00:58,630 --> 00:00:59,110
that we get.

12
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:01,270
And then let's pop in some style

13
00:01:07,540 --> 00:01:09,000
and then to make a circle.

14
00:01:09,070 --> 00:01:12,970
We use hash and then circle to select it.

15
00:01:13,660 --> 00:01:30,300
And we want a with of let's say 150 pixels a height of 150 pixels and border radius of 50 percent.

16
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:32,150
That's what makes it secular.

17
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:40,090
And then the background color of green.

18
00:01:40,180 --> 00:01:42,160
All right let's just check that.

19
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:42,830
Excellent.

20
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:43,600
Oh indeed.

21
00:01:43,610 --> 00:01:45,880
Jay query is still installed successfully.

22
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:46,750
That's great.

23
00:01:46,750 --> 00:01:49,290
We don't need that carrot anymore.

24
00:01:50,710 --> 00:01:51,370
All right.

25
00:01:51,400 --> 00:01:54,390
And now let's get the squares.

26
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:56,180
So don't.

27
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:01,900
Because with selecting a class this time and will have the width and height the same

28
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:18,200
and this time the there's no radius and the background color is red.

29
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:18,750
Have a look.

30
00:02:18,820 --> 00:02:19,210
OK.

31
00:02:19,230 --> 00:02:20,120
That's great.

32
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:22,260
The two squares have kind of gone together.

33
00:02:22,610 --> 00:02:28,650
So let's give everything a margin of 10 pixels.

34
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,150
To separate out everything.

35
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:35,170
Lovely.

36
00:02:35,710 --> 00:02:36,350
OK.

37
00:02:36,550 --> 00:02:42,490
So now we're going to write some jay Querrey which we'll just alert something when we tap on some combination

38
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:47,440
of these squares and circles.

39
00:02:47,540 --> 00:02:54,190
So remember with javascript there was only one way that we sought to select an object and that was by

40
00:02:54,190 --> 00:02:55,310
its ID.

41
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:00,730
There are other ways to select objects in javascript but we only looked at the get element by id command

42
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:01,820
NJ query.

43
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:03,720
This looks very different.

44
00:03:03,820 --> 00:03:10,730
So we start off with a string character and that is just shift 4 for me and probably for years well

45
00:03:11,100 --> 00:03:15,850
but it may be somewhere else on your keyboard and pretty much every j where instruction starts with

46
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:24,340
a string so the string here kind of says Right we're doing something with J query and then we put parentheses.

47
00:03:24,340 --> 00:03:29,720
And as you can see here on my text editor saying we need a string of selector.

48
00:03:30,320 --> 00:03:36,880
So inside these parentheses we enter a string and that's the thing that we want to select.

49
00:03:36,910 --> 00:03:41,760
So if we want to select this first circle we want to select it by its ID.

50
00:03:42,100 --> 00:03:46,960
So that's a hash just as it is in CSSA.

51
00:03:47,410 --> 00:03:52,260
And then the ID circle.

52
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:59,950
So what this does essentially means select the circle and then we want to do something when that circle

53
00:03:59,950 --> 00:04:01,650
is clicked.

54
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:06,090
So we use dot and then click.

55
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:09,430
So pretty similar to the unclick command but slightly different.

56
00:04:09,430 --> 00:04:17,620
We're just looking at Click here and then we want to do something when the circle is clicked and just

57
00:04:17,620 --> 00:04:23,070
like with javascript previously we create a function.

58
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:28,560
So you'll notice that there are bits of javascript that remain unchanged in Jay query and creating a

59
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,900
function is one of them.

60
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:39,540
As before a function pair of parentheses and then curly brackets to contain our function code.

61
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:47,600
So this is the equivalent of document don't get element by id circle dot on click equals and then function.

62
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,150
So it's a lot shorter.

63
00:04:49,350 --> 00:04:52,600
And as you'll see in a minute a lot more flexible as well.

64
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:59,690
So if we just let that circle was clicked something like that.

65
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:05,490
Let's see that in action.

66
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:06,660
So the circle was clicked.

67
00:05:06,690 --> 00:05:11,450
And obviously that doesn't work for squares.

68
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:17,970
Here's a challenge for you that can you change this code so that instead of selecting the circle it

69
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:20,450
selects the two squares.

70
00:05:20,610 --> 00:05:24,680
So when either a square is clicked we get an alert.

71
00:05:24,750 --> 00:05:26,100
How do you think we might see that.

72
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:32,130
I hope you got it.

73
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:35,910
It's just like in C S S instead of hash circle.

74
00:05:35,940 --> 00:05:44,760
We use dot square and then this selects both the squares and applies this function to both of them.

75
00:05:44,760 --> 00:05:46,320
So let's see that in action.

76
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:52,550
Let's change the alert to make it make sense first a square was clicked.

77
00:05:52,980 --> 00:05:54,010
That's how I look.

78
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:56,290
So now we click that square.

79
00:05:56,320 --> 00:06:00,270
We get the alerts we click the other square we get the alert as well.

80
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:04,080
We collect the circle nothing happens.

81
00:06:04,170 --> 00:06:10,380
So this is the second big advantage of using Jey query as well as the code being bit shorter neater

82
00:06:10,660 --> 00:06:19,460
is more flexible so I can just replace whatever goes in here with a class or an ID to select things.

83
00:06:19,500 --> 00:06:27,800
I can also select things by that type so I could select all of the divs for example just like that.

84
00:06:27,810 --> 00:06:34,050
So if it doesn't start with a hash or a dot then we will select all the elements with that name.

85
00:06:34,110 --> 00:06:38,320
So we are elements that are called a div.

86
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:46,600
So now we change the code to a div was clicked then it will now respond when any one of those three

87
00:06:47,740 --> 00:06:49,080
is clicked.

88
00:06:49,270 --> 00:06:53,320
And if I click anywhere else nothing happens because there's no divs over there.

89
00:06:53,980 --> 00:06:58,570
So this is an early taste of the power ease and flexibility of Jake Weary.

90
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:06,730
We can change our code by just a little bit and we can select both class ID and the type of element

91
00:07:06,730 --> 00:07:08,430
that we want to select.

92
00:07:08,430 --> 00:07:12,400
All right so now we've seen how to use a query to respond to a click.

93
00:07:12,460 --> 00:07:16,450
Let's use it to change and adjust our website content.
