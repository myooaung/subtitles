Welcome to Section 2 of the complete web developer course now that you're all set up with your text

2
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.940
editor and browser we're going to be cracking straight on with HVM L which is the basic language of

3
00:00:11.970 --> 00:00:13.210
every web site.

4
00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:19.080
I'll show you the structure of a basic DML page and we'll look at some of the key elements that make

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:25.750
up a web site such as headers paragraphs text forms tables and a lot more.

6
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:31.590
At the end of the section you'll be making a real web site as a challenge and also at the end of every

7
00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.290
video you'll find the code that you need and a coding challenge as well which gives you an opportunity

8
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:43.230
to practice what you've learnt in that video and get instant feedback from our coding exercises system

9
00:00:44.220 --> 00:00:45.140
at the same time.

10
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.730
I'd encourage you to download a copy of my book How to end $10000 while learning to code which comes

11
00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:55.230
with the course and just start reading the opening chapters and start thinking about how you're going

12
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:57.570
to put the skills that you're learning into action.

13
00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:01.680
Enjoy the section and I'll see you at the beginning of section 3.
