1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,500
So for in the Jaker section we've seen have Jay query is a little bit easier to read and write than

2
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:08,280
javascript.

3
00:00:08,460 --> 00:00:14,090
And it's a bit more flexible as well in that we can easily select classes or a range of element types

4
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:16,110
using exactly the same syntax.

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,120
But there's also a number of functions that are very easy to do with Jay equerry.

6
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,780
That would be very difficult to do with plain Javascript.

7
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:27,220
And one of those is fading content.

8
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,140
So let's see how easy that is to achieve with Jay query.

9
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,840
So let's try and find out whatever item is clicked when we click it.

10
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,740
Rather than making it disappear.

11
00:00:39,410 --> 00:00:45,810
So again to select the item we use this and then it's as simple as

12
00:00:48,630 --> 00:00:52,320
applying the function fade out to it.

13
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:55,020
Don't forget the parentheses.

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:55,850
Let's take a look.

15
00:00:57,350 --> 00:00:58,670
There we go.

16
00:00:59,390 --> 00:01:05,660
So a lovely face animation just by using a single key word there.

17
00:01:05,810 --> 00:01:11,560
We can also use hige just to show you which is effectively the same as setting the display to none.

18
00:01:11,570 --> 00:01:18,620
As we saw in the previous section that just does the fade but without any kind of gradual fighting as

19
00:01:18,620 --> 00:01:24,800
with pretty much all j queery functions we can apply a lot of parameters and settings to those functions

20
00:01:24,800 --> 00:01:25,560
if we want.

21
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:30,720
And the easy way to find out what those are is to do a quick search.

22
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:38,750
So if I start with something like Jay queery fade out likely the top result will be the Jay queery dot

23
00:01:38,750 --> 00:01:45,740
com Web site itself which I thoroughly recommend has some really good documentation and examples on

24
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:46,660
it.

25
00:01:47,450 --> 00:01:52,430
So if you want to find out for example you might want to make it fade out more slowly or more quickly

26
00:01:52,760 --> 00:01:54,810
or in a number of different ways.

27
00:01:55,160 --> 00:01:57,910
Then you'll get all of the options here.

28
00:01:57,920 --> 00:01:59,760
Let's just look at a couple of the examples.

29
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:02,350
So this shows you roughly what's going on there.

30
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:10,190
But we can also look at some direct examples like that one that you can see that that's a slow fade

31
00:02:10,190 --> 00:02:11,720
out.

32
00:02:12,050 --> 00:02:14,870
So we could try that ourselves if we want.

33
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:22,970
And there's some more complicated content here that looks like it's going to fade out when it's clicked

34
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:27,820
and say if I try that.

35
00:02:27,820 --> 00:02:28,900
There you go.

36
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:35,100
So the click is doing the fade out and then it's adding some text as well.

37
00:02:35,380 --> 00:02:36,880
So that's the next thing we're going to see.

38
00:02:36,880 --> 00:02:38,260
I'll just show you that again.

39
00:02:41,140 --> 00:02:44,130
When we clicked on really that it did the fade out.

40
00:02:44,170 --> 00:02:50,440
And then when the fadeout completed it did something else and that can be really useful not just with

41
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:53,930
fighting but with any function that might take a certain amount of time.

42
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:57,910
You often want to do something else just when it's completed.

43
00:02:58,240 --> 00:03:01,570
So let's see how we do that using our fade here.

44
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:15,160
So first off let's change it to a nice slow fade out so that we can see that we get to see it happening

45
00:03:15,220 --> 00:03:16,680
a little more slowly.

46
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:24,090
So how would we add a callback function i.e. a function that happens when the fadeout is complete.

47
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:30,310
Well we add it as a parameter in the function call itself.

48
00:03:30,310 --> 00:03:40,530
So just after we add the slow parameter we're going to add a function and then this will be defined

49
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,500
in just the same way that we set up a function on the click.

50
00:03:44,520 --> 00:03:49,780
So whatever I write here will now happen as soon as the fight is completed.

51
00:03:49,780 --> 00:04:00,310
So for now let's just do a night to let fade out has finished.

52
00:04:00,510 --> 00:04:03,110
All right let's take a look.

53
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:05,310
Fade out and there we go.

54
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:07,390
Feda has finished.

55
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:12,450
So one of the particularly useful situations for callbacks is when you're getting data from another

56
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:16,640
web site or another bit of your Web site which will see how to do it and a couple of videos time.

57
00:04:16,710 --> 00:04:17,760
And that could take a while.

58
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:22,440
If you've got a large bit of data and use an internet connection it's quite slow for example.

59
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:27,860
So you want to wait until you've got that data and then process it and do something with it and callback

60
00:04:27,870 --> 00:04:31,430
functions are the perfect way to do that.

61
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,940
All right let's have a few challenges then I'm going to get rid of all of this.

62
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:44,280
And the first challenge is going to be can you create a paragraph with some text and a button such that

63
00:04:44,340 --> 00:04:47,560
when the button is pressed the paragraph fades out.

64
00:04:47,780 --> 00:04:48,100
Bedford

65
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:57,070
OK I read that one well I'm going to get rid of my style's

66
00:04:59,890 --> 00:05:01,590
because I don't need them any more.

67
00:05:02,350 --> 00:05:03,550
So in my paragraph

68
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:09,270
this is some text from them and they don't.

69
00:05:10,090 --> 00:05:17,830
And then my button I'll give it an ID of fadeout

70
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:27,920
and then we'll call it fade out text.

71
00:05:27,980 --> 00:05:28,390
All right.

72
00:05:28,420 --> 00:05:31,600
And then I just need to select my button

73
00:05:35,200 --> 00:05:45,680
like that and then I want this to have a click function attached to it just like that.

74
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,680
And I want to find out the text when that button is clicked.

75
00:05:50,770 --> 00:05:59,410
So I'm going to select the text or I'll just do it using P because it's a paragraph and then fadeout

76
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:03,450
simple as that.

77
00:06:03,470 --> 00:06:04,760
Let's take a look.

78
00:06:04,830 --> 00:06:07,750
Fadeout text.

79
00:06:07,900 --> 00:06:08,940
I've made a mistake.

80
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:11,330
Anyone see what it is.

81
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,380
I forgot the parentheses.

82
00:06:13,780 --> 00:06:14,470
It's a function.

83
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,240
So you always have parentheses after it.

84
00:06:16,270 --> 00:06:22,910
Even if you're not going to have any options like slow or callback function.

85
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:26,380
I notice as well once it's faded out it's gone.

86
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,280
So the display property of the paragraph is made equal to none.

87
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:34,590
Just as we saw before and it's effectively not there anymore.

88
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:37,380
OK so challenge 2 is going to be.

89
00:06:37,390 --> 00:06:43,420
Can you have some text in a different paragraph which is initially hidden and then when you press another

90
00:06:43,420 --> 00:06:46,960
button it fades that text in different

91
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:55,120
writes.

92
00:06:55,140 --> 00:06:56,460
Have you managed to do that.

93
00:06:58,980 --> 00:07:09,300
So this text will be hidden initially and now we're going to need some ideas.

94
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,180
Differentiate between our two paragraphs

95
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:25,050
so we'll have text and hidden text and I'll change this to text so they're not confusing each other.

96
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:30,490
And then I need to make hidden text hidden initially so I'll bring some styles back in.

97
00:07:35,600 --> 00:07:40,840
I would get that I only need to style hidden text

98
00:07:44,130 --> 00:07:47,480
and the only style I need to give it is display.

99
00:07:47,570 --> 00:07:50,640
None that will make it hidden initially.

100
00:07:53,980 --> 00:07:58,000
And then I'm going to have a button.

101
00:07:58,110 --> 00:08:02,270
The ID is going to be fade in.

102
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:11,900
Which is a little clue as to what the function is that I'm going to use and that fade in text.

103
00:08:11,920 --> 00:08:14,080
Let's just check that that's all I care.

104
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:19,070
Yep obviously fade in text at the moment doesn't do anything for that.

105
00:08:19,090 --> 00:08:20,420
My semi-colon there.

106
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:27,780
So to make the fade in button do something I need to select it in the usual way.

107
00:08:27,780 --> 00:08:39,990
Fade in and I'm adding a click function to it in the same way as usual and then as I hope you figure

108
00:08:40,020 --> 00:08:44,760
it out to make something Faden you just select it.

109
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:58,200
So this is hidden text and we want to make it fade in and don't forget your parentheses.

110
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:59,080
Let's have a look.

111
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:03,330
Didn't Text fantastic.

112
00:09:03,350 --> 00:09:04,160
There it is.

113
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:09,050
All right now there's one more challenge for you and this one is a bit of a tricky one but I have given

114
00:09:09,050 --> 00:09:11,350
you a clue to it earlier in the video.

115
00:09:11,630 --> 00:09:21,130
So what I now want you to do is to go back to having just a single paragraph but instead of having just

116
00:09:21,130 --> 00:09:30,460
a fade out button we're going to have a toggle button on what that toggle button is going to do is if

117
00:09:30,460 --> 00:09:32,480
the text is there it will make it disappear.

118
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:36,080
And if the text is not there it will make it appear.

119
00:09:36,310 --> 00:09:38,370
So that's a pretty big challenge.

120
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:42,030
There's a number of different ways you could do it but give it a shot.

121
00:09:42,310 --> 00:09:42,700
Good luck

122
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:51,000
OK.

123
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:52,310
Did you manage him.

124
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,110
I'm going to show you a couple of different ways starting with what I think is the best method ending

125
00:09:57,110 --> 00:10:01,820
with a method that allows us to use callbacks which is quite nice.

126
00:10:01,820 --> 00:10:07,860
So let's do everything with a single function.

127
00:10:07,980 --> 00:10:13,490
And now we're working on the toggle button.

128
00:10:13,650 --> 00:10:18,210
So as I change quite a lot there let's just check at the moment if I click toggle text it should fade

129
00:10:18,210 --> 00:10:24,770
out great of course but it doesn't say yet is faith back in.

130
00:10:24,790 --> 00:10:31,120
So what I need is some way to know whether the text has faded out or not depending on what stage we

131
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,210
are on our page.

132
00:10:32,230 --> 00:10:35,350
There's no way I can know just with the code here.

133
00:10:35,370 --> 00:10:42,700
I need to look at some property of the page and what I can do as I hope some of you spot it is I can

134
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:50,810
use the display CSSA property to find out whether or not the text has been faded out.

135
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,190
So if the

136
00:10:56,650 --> 00:10:57,250
text

137
00:10:59,730 --> 00:11:03,390
element has got a display

138
00:11:06,090 --> 00:11:13,440
property of none then we're going to want to fight it in

139
00:11:17,980 --> 00:11:19,860
reps.

140
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:22,970
We want to take the text and fade it in.

141
00:11:23,310 --> 00:11:27,390
So that that's what I was hoping you would think of doing.

142
00:11:27,390 --> 00:11:30,690
Don't worry if you didn't but this is quite a neat way of doing it.

143
00:11:30,690 --> 00:11:38,090
So we're looking at the display property of the s of the text element if that's equal to none.

144
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:39,810
That means it's not displayed.

145
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:43,980
So we want to fight it in if it's not equal to none.

146
00:11:44,010 --> 00:11:45,740
That means it is displayed.

147
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,090
So we want to fight it out.

148
00:11:52,130 --> 00:11:53,790
That's that's look.

149
00:11:54,320 --> 00:12:02,560
So toggling it fades out suddenly again fighting are so very well done.

150
00:12:02,570 --> 00:12:08,360
If you did it that way I'll just show you another way that might be better in certain situations and

151
00:12:08,360 --> 00:12:14,590
that is to have a variable which keeps track of the state of the paragraph text.

152
00:12:14,810 --> 00:12:25,460
So we might call it something like text showing text displaying or something like that and will initially

153
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:32,250
set it to true because when we first read the page the text is going to show.

154
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:42,230
And then instead of looking at the CSSA property we can just look at if text showing is true.

155
00:12:42,230 --> 00:12:49,070
And in fact we can do a bit of a shortcut and we can just look at if text showing because remember the

156
00:12:49,070 --> 00:12:52,480
if statement is looking for something which is true or false.

157
00:12:52,610 --> 00:12:57,230
And one advantage of using Brillion variables is that they are either true or false so you don't need

158
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:00,140
to write is equal to.

159
00:13:00,260 --> 00:13:07,930
You can do if you want it'll work but you can leave it like just text showing.

160
00:13:07,940 --> 00:13:11,100
So let's have a quick look at that.

161
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,620
But of course if Tex is sharing I want it to fade out rather than fade in.

162
00:13:15,640 --> 00:13:18,140
So let's just make sure that's working for the fade out.

163
00:13:18,170 --> 00:13:18,730
It is.

164
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,200
Yes.

165
00:13:19,430 --> 00:13:23,780
It's not going to work for the fade in yet because we haven't updated text showing.

166
00:13:23,930 --> 00:13:28,940
So this is a little bit unnecessary but I like to use callback from actions whenever we can.

167
00:13:28,940 --> 00:13:32,240
So I'm going to add a callback function to our fade out

168
00:13:35,830 --> 00:13:43,710
such that when the fade out is complete we'll set text showing to fourths.

169
00:13:43,720 --> 00:13:45,640
So now it's no longer showing.

170
00:13:45,730 --> 00:13:52,270
So if we click it again it will fade it back in.

171
00:13:53,260 --> 00:14:02,650
And of course we'll need a callback function for that as well which resets text text showing back to

172
00:14:04,420 --> 00:14:06,820
true.

173
00:14:07,100 --> 00:14:09,560
OK let's check it out.

174
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,240
So it fades out fades back in fade out fades back in.

175
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:16,320
Fantastic.

176
00:14:16,340 --> 00:14:20,550
So as I say in this case I prefer the previous method just because it's a bit neater.

177
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:26,020
But you might have situations where you can't just grab the information you need from a CSSA property.

178
00:14:26,030 --> 00:14:30,830
And in those situations you're probably going to want some kind of variable which keeps track of the

179
00:14:30,830 --> 00:14:34,350
state of the various items on your page.

180
00:14:34,910 --> 00:14:39,370
Well then if you manage to do that challenge don't worry too much if you didn't it was a toughie.

181
00:14:39,830 --> 00:14:42,600
So now we know how to feed content in and out.

182
00:14:42,710 --> 00:14:48,830
We realized that fighting is actually a specific example of the more general animating content which

183
00:14:48,830 --> 00:14:50,510
we can do with Jay queery.

184
00:14:50,780 --> 00:14:52,360
So let's find out how we do that.

185
00:14:52,430 --> 00:14:56,750
We'll have our elements changing size shrinking growing moving all over the place.

186
00:14:56,750 --> 00:14:59,250
It's going to be a lot of fun and we'll do it in the next video.
