1
00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:04,540
So how does responsive web design with bootstrap work.

2
00:00:04,550 --> 00:00:09,680
Let's take a look back over at the bootstrap docs which are really good by the way.

3
00:00:09,680 --> 00:00:14,140
And I thoroughly recommend reading if you want more detail on anything that we're covering.

4
00:00:14,150 --> 00:00:19,910
Let's go over to lay out a quick look at the overview.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:27,440
So first off bootstrap has divs with classes of container and they do what you might imagine.

6
00:00:27,460 --> 00:00:29,960
They contain the content within them.

7
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,980
You can use contain a fluid to use a container which stretches the whole width of the user's screen.

8
00:00:38,540 --> 00:00:41,910
Now this bit here is where the magic really happens.

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,020
Bootstrap uses something called media queries to have what are known as break points.

10
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:53,580
Now breakpoints are device widths low which the layout of the page changes.

11
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,620
So if for example I take my screen and I make it narrower and narrower.

12
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:00,470
Nothing's really changing but something to change there.

13
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:08,890
Can you see so we have a breakpoint at that point which as we get narrower increases the margin on the

14
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:12,450
left eye makes everything a little bit smaller.

15
00:01:12,670 --> 00:01:15,340
If we keep going we should find another bright point.

16
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:17,780
There it is.

17
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:21,760
So that's changing the layout yet again if we keep going.

18
00:01:21,760 --> 00:01:25,340
I think there's one more there it is.

19
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:31,290
So there's a jump just that there it is.

20
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:32,920
And I think that's the last one.

21
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:40,150
There's another one even there as well and that's the the thinnest breakpoint there.

22
00:01:40,150 --> 00:01:45,190
So there's a number of breakpoints and the layout is then going to be different for screen sizes above

23
00:01:45,190 --> 00:01:47,150
or below those breakpoints.

24
00:01:47,240 --> 00:01:51,910
That's actually quite easy to achieve in CSSA using media queries.

25
00:01:51,910 --> 00:01:54,250
We have actually seen media queries before.

26
00:01:54,550 --> 00:02:01,010
You may remember them from our good old example the column where we started the H.T. M.S. if we control

27
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:10,030
the right click and view page source there's a media Querrey at the bottom of the stylesheet which I

28
00:02:10,030 --> 00:02:14,050
did mention but we didn't go into any great detail on it at the time.

29
00:02:14,170 --> 00:02:21,880
And essentially what this says is that this is a media query and these styles will then be applied as

30
00:02:21,880 --> 00:02:28,690
long as the width is less than 700 pixels and that's all a media query is it's a set of styles that

31
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:37,420
are applied at a certain width and we can see the effect that that has on example domain as I get narrower

32
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:40,970
and narrower some point round here I'll hit 700 pixels.

33
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:44,050
And then you'll see the design flip.

34
00:02:44,350 --> 00:02:44,900
Yeah.

35
00:02:47,630 --> 00:02:54,070
So that gray background only exists above 700 pixels.

36
00:02:54,890 --> 00:02:58,820
So you can see below 700 pixels the background color is white.

37
00:02:58,820 --> 00:03:03,250
F f f and we lose the border radius and padding and everything else.

38
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:06,990
So for example the comb is very slightly responsive.

39
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,730
You've got a kind of mobile version here and a desktop version here.

40
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,390
We can do a bit better than that.

41
00:03:14,430 --> 00:03:15,960
We don't just want to have two versions.

42
00:03:15,960 --> 00:03:17,840
We want to have several different versions.

43
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,160
However you're probably not keen on creating several different designs or layouts in your websites.

44
00:03:23,160 --> 00:03:27,470
That's where something like bootstrap comes in really handy because we can just have a single layout

45
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:30,060
which then readjust itself nicely.

46
00:03:30,070 --> 00:03:32,980
Each screen size using Gritz.

47
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,020
So let's have a look and see what the P-trap website has to say about griots.

48
00:03:39,090 --> 00:03:42,890
So the grid system definitely isn't unique to bootstrap.

49
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,950
It's become an extremely popular way of setting up a responsive web site.

50
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:53,420
So I'm going to look at a very particular example first off and then you'll see some more general examples.

51
00:03:55,340 --> 00:04:00,770
So here we've got three columns and this is the code that creates them.

52
00:04:00,800 --> 00:04:06,850
So I'm actually going to copy this code and we'll look at it in our own bootstrapped rechannel file

53
00:04:06,860 --> 00:04:14,600
I think it will be slightly clearer that will leave the hello world H-1 in and then we should really

54
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,830
put hello world inside the container.

55
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,560
Everything on a beach front page would ideally be inside a container.

56
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:28,790
So what we've got then is a div with a class of row and then another div inside that with a class of

57
00:04:28,820 --> 00:04:32,200
coal S.M. for an F is going on there.

58
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,990
Well call is short for columns.

59
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,380
S-M is short for small and 4 for presents for columns.

60
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:44,770
So the bootstrap grid system is split into 12 little columns.

61
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:51,560
So what we're essentially saying here is create a div that is for many columns wide and then another

62
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:57,770
one that formerly columns wide and then another one that's for many columns wide.

63
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:06,620
So now if we stretch that out four with we get three nice columns all nicely spread out there a third

64
00:05:06,620 --> 00:05:10,960
of the width of the whole page as we bring things in.

65
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:15,770
You can see we're seeing those breakpoints already.

66
00:05:15,830 --> 00:05:22,130
The main break point however is going to come in and the moment now and there it is.

67
00:05:22,130 --> 00:05:29,840
So you can see we've shifted from having three columns all the way across to having them stacked.

68
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,510
And that's the key idea of grids that the columns will arrange themselves differently depending on the

69
00:05:35,510 --> 00:05:41,420
width of the user's screen and that's really the key idea of how Gritz work is a little more subtlety

70
00:05:41,420 --> 00:05:41,750
to it.

71
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,320
As you might imagine and I'll show you just a couple of extra features now.

72
00:05:45,590 --> 00:05:51,340
Firstly you might be wondering what this S-M really means obviously for small but what does that mean.

73
00:05:51,380 --> 00:05:58,460
Well there are a number of different breakpoints that you can use within bootstrap and the small is

74
00:05:58,730 --> 00:05:59,960
the first break point.

75
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:04,190
So that's around here but we've seen that there are breakpoints.

76
00:06:04,190 --> 00:06:08,430
There's one there and there's one there as well.

77
00:06:09,010 --> 00:06:18,460
So if I want to use a larger breakpoint to be the point where this switches from horizontal to stacked

78
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:25,820
and I would just change that see M.D short for medium.

79
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,560
And if we have a look at that now.

80
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:32,640
So that will stack at the medium breakpoint.

81
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:34,640
So it's getting smaller and smaller and there we go.

82
00:06:34,640 --> 00:06:35,680
Now it stacks.

83
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,360
So the medium great point is around that.

84
00:06:38,610 --> 00:06:44,190
So that can be really useful depending on how much content you want to have in each of these columns

85
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:50,320
to give you the details of what the various options are.

86
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,750
So the small columns all stack at 576 pixels.

87
00:06:55,920 --> 00:07:01,540
So that's about this kind of with the first example that we looked at

88
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:13,270
then medium will stack at 720 pixels which was the second example and the large 940 pixels an extra

89
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:16,140
large at 1140 pixels.

90
00:07:16,570 --> 00:07:24,520
Now when you get really fancy you can start mixing the small widths with medium and large to create

91
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:28,660
really quite complex different layouts depending on screen size.

92
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:32,490
If you're interested in that then just have a look at some of these examples here.

93
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:36,970
I think they're quite complex so I'm not going to go into them in great detail right now but we will

94
00:07:36,970 --> 00:07:39,380
be looking more at them later on.

95
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:48,720
For now though I'm just going to give you a quick challenge and that is to create from scratch a 50

96
00:07:48,710 --> 00:07:54,940
50 with layout or two columns essentially 50 percent of the screen each which then collapse when my

97
00:07:54,940 --> 00:08:07,180
screen size is less than 720 pixels go for it.

98
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:09,920
All right I hope you managed it.

99
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,710
We start as always with bootstrap with a container div

100
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:26,150
and then we use I wrote Dave to say that we're creating a role

101
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:36,530
and then our first column is going to have a class of zero Alpha column.

102
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:40,810
Now we want this to collapse at 7:20 which is

103
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:47,480
the container with associated with medium.

104
00:08:47,670 --> 00:08:48,540
So.

105
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:58,210
So we're going to use Culham dash M.D and we want a 50 50 with that means out of the 12 columns.

106
00:08:58,410 --> 00:09:06,560
Each of our two halves is going to be six columns each.

107
00:09:07,350 --> 00:09:15,690
So we've got CIOL for columns M-Day because we want to switch at 720 pixels to a stacked view and then

108
00:09:15,690 --> 00:09:17,850
6 because we want this to be half the screen

109
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:30,750
and I'll just call it the first half and then we're going to use exactly the same code for the second

110
00:09:30,750 --> 00:09:31,320
half.

111
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:34,170
And that's it.

112
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:36,010
Let's take a look.

113
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:38,850
So it stacks there which looks promising.

114
00:09:39,090 --> 00:09:42,010
Once we move to 720 pixels which is around here.

115
00:09:42,030 --> 00:09:42,860
There we go.

116
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:45,360
The switches to

117
00:09:48,410 --> 00:09:49,490
horizontal.

118
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:50,660
Fantastic.

119
00:09:50,690 --> 00:09:56,590
So I had like give you a basic idea about how we use bootstrap to create responsive web sites.

120
00:09:56,690 --> 00:10:00,050
What we've got so far though doesn't look a lot like a web site and it definitely doesn't look that

121
00:10:00,050 --> 00:10:00,890
beautiful.

122
00:10:00,890 --> 00:10:05,720
So we're going to start looking at some of the bootstrap components that can help us create a professional

123
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,600
looking website in just minutes and the first of those that we'll look at is the nav bar.
