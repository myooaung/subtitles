1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:04,530
During the course you'll probably have a few problems with your code.

2
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:06,440
It won't work as you expect it to.

3
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:09,840
You'll get bugs and you'll probably be pretty frustrated.

4
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:14,520
So I'd like to take a couple of minutes right now to show you how best to deal with those situations

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:18,600
when they arise and how to get answers super quickly.

6
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,470
So step one is debug your code.

7
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:25,500
Usual thing is to check for error messages.

8
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,720
So I would have a look in the compiler in the browser wherever it is that you're working to see exactly

9
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:31,980
what's causing the problem.

10
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:37,140
You can normally get the line number as well and then you can just use that to hopefully work out where

11
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,030
the error messages had in that bracket or the semi-colon or whatever it is that's missing and move on

12
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:43,900
with the course.

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:49,830
Failing that my usual advice is to remove all the code that you just added until it works again and

14
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:56,180
then add it in gradually one line by line then you should find that at some point it will stop working.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:58,080
If it doesn't and you're problem solved.

16
00:00:58,080 --> 00:01:02,910
But if it does at least then you know exactly where the problem is and you can start to find solutions

17
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:03,650
to it.

18
00:01:05,030 --> 00:01:10,580
Finally if that doesn't help compile your code against my demo code all the lectures have code built

19
00:01:10,580 --> 00:01:16,250
in to them so that you can download and then you can see what is different in your code and hopefully

20
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,430
see if that is causing the problem.

21
00:01:20,050 --> 00:01:23,930
All right so what if you've done all this debugging and you still can't get it working.

22
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,290
Well step two and this is what makes you a real programmer is learning how to find solutions online.

23
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:35,260
So it's pretty straightforward really it is just googling my general approach is to google the specific

24
00:01:35,260 --> 00:01:36,730
error message that you've got.

25
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:41,950
And if you don't have an error message then get one either from the compiler from the browser from X

26
00:01:41,950 --> 00:01:47,620
code whatever it is and then Google that along with the name of the programming language almost certainly

27
00:01:47,770 --> 00:01:51,460
at least one person if not several people have had that exact same problem.

28
00:01:51,550 --> 00:01:55,390
And there's probably a solution right there on Stack Overflow for you.

29
00:01:55,390 --> 00:01:57,110
So that's issue number one.

30
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:00,820
If that doesn't help then you can always google how do I do.

31
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:03,010
And then whatever it is they are trying to do.

32
00:02:03,190 --> 00:02:08,140
Again put the name of the programming language in there as well and that will probably get you a few

33
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:10,720
lines of code which will achieve exactly what you want.

34
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:15,490
You can either paste those in and move on or you can see what was different about those to the code

35
00:02:15,490 --> 00:02:16,470
that you were using.

36
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:19,270
And then hopefully work out where you are going wrong.

37
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,030
And then once again move on with the course right.

38
00:02:24,050 --> 00:02:26,350
Occasionally of course you will have to ask them questions.

39
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:27,930
And that's absolutely fine.

40
00:02:27,950 --> 00:02:34,010
I love that we've got 200000 people in the forums for these courses and people are extremely helpful

41
00:02:34,070 --> 00:02:37,860
and I want to get answers to your questions as quickly as possible.

42
00:02:37,910 --> 00:02:40,860
So the main thing here is to ask good questions.

43
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:47,110
I've answered thousands of simple questions now over these courses and I know what makes a good question.

44
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:49,880
So first off Be positive.

45
00:02:49,880 --> 00:02:55,510
I know you're feeling frustrated and often that can leak out into when you're asking a question.

46
00:02:55,820 --> 00:02:59,250
But if you keep things positive you're much more likely to get an answer.

47
00:02:59,270 --> 00:03:00,920
So ask very nicely for help.

48
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:03,240
So you'd be very grateful for anyone that can help you out.

49
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:07,540
And you're much more likely to get a quick and helpful response.

50
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:09,360
Secondly be specific.

51
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:14,720
So don't just paste in a massive load of code and say this doesn't work what's wrong but once you've

52
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,070
done all the error checking and the debugging you should know exactly where your problem is.

53
00:03:19,160 --> 00:03:24,650
So I send a screenshot of that code or send the few lines of code that are not working along with the

54
00:03:24,650 --> 00:03:27,560
error message so that we know exactly where you're going wrong.

55
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:35,390
And then once again you should get a nice quick and accurate response to your question if you can give

56
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:36,830
a link to your code in action.

57
00:03:36,830 --> 00:03:40,870
So this is particularly useful for the web course but maybe for other courses as well.

58
00:03:40,970 --> 00:03:46,910
Either give a link on your web hosting or to just been dot com or another site where your code is actually

59
00:03:46,910 --> 00:03:47,600
running.

60
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:52,370
Then we can make changes and test it out and we should be able to get back to you even quicker with

61
00:03:52,370 --> 00:03:53,170
a solution.

62
00:03:54,940 --> 00:03:58,500
Finally once you've got your solution thank someone if they've helped you.

63
00:03:58,540 --> 00:04:03,340
I've looked back over the forms and the vast majority of helpful comments are not thanked at all.

64
00:04:03,340 --> 00:04:05,560
Which doesn't encourage people to help people again.

65
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:08,690
So please do just go back and say thanks that was really helpful.

66
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:11,020
So that they know that they've helped you.

67
00:04:11,620 --> 00:04:13,790
And last but not least while you're there.

68
00:04:13,900 --> 00:04:16,450
Why not see if you can answer someone else's question.

69
00:04:16,450 --> 00:04:21,640
If you've had help from me or from other people during the course then it's great to give back a little

70
00:04:21,640 --> 00:04:25,110
to the cause and then help a few other people as well.

71
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:29,650
So while you've asked your question just answer a couple of other peoples and then that will keep the

72
00:04:29,650 --> 00:04:36,590
love flowing and keep everyone happy and progressing in that coding Korea's so enjoy the course and

73
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:38,170
I'll see you in the forums.
