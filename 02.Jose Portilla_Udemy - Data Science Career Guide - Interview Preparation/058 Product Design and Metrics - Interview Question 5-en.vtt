00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:09.070

Welcome to interview question number five for product design metrics.



2

00:00:09.100 --> 00:00:14.260

So now we have a new situation here and this one is actually a little less of a conversation and it's



3

00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:18.550

a little more mathematical So you should be able to basically prove your correct answer.



4

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:21.140

So let's go over the situation that's occurring here.



5

00:00:21.190 --> 00:00:26.830

There's a car company that produces all the cars for a particular country and they produce two models



6

00:00:26.830 --> 00:00:27.690

of cars.



7

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:30.840

We'll go ahead and call them Car X in car Y.



8

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:34.380

Now 50 percent of the population drives car X..



9

00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.600

And the other 50 percent of the population drives car Y.



10

00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:42.970

So the population is perfectly split between these two models of cars.



11

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:48.580

Now what happened was two potential technologies have just been discovered that could help reduce gasoline



12

00:00:48.580 --> 00:00:49.430

usage.



13

00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.140

So there's two technologies.



14

00:00:52.140 --> 00:00:57.290

Technology and technology and they each apply to a particular model of car.



15

00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:06.150

So technology a increases the MPG or mpg of Car X from 50 miles per gallon to 75 miles per gallon.



16

00:01:06.170 --> 00:01:12.150

Technology increases the mpg of car Y from 10 mpg to 11 miles per gallon.



17

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.510

So the question is which technologies should be implemented to save the most gasoline for the entire



18

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:19.230

country.



19

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:20.370

OK.



20

00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:24.960

Let's do a quick little overview to make sure you understand the question and the situation.



21

00:01:25.610 --> 00:01:32.390

So again the situation is that a particular car company produces all the cars for the country Car X



22

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:38.100

and car Y and that half the population drives car X and half the population drives car Y.



23

00:01:38.120 --> 00:01:40.020

There's two technologies you can implement.



24

00:01:40.090 --> 00:01:44.060

You can only ambulant one of these either technology or technology.



25

00:01:44.060 --> 00:01:51.150

So currently the mpg of Car X is 50 mpg and the current mpg of car Y is 10 miles per gallon.



26

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.810

Remember half the population drives car X half the population drives car Y.



27

00:01:55.820 --> 00:02:03.560

Now the question is if you were to implement technology which increases car X from 50 mpg to 75 75 miles



28

00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:10.400

per gallon would that be better than increasing the mpg of car Y from 10 mpg to 11 miles per gallon.



29

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:14.870

And keep in mind what the question is asking is which technologies should be implemented to save the



30

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:17.160

most gasoline overall for the country.



31

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:24.110

So implemented technology or technology B which one of these overall is going to reduce total gas consumption



32

00:02:24.110 --> 00:02:25.550

for the entire country.



33

00:02:26.510 --> 00:02:26.910

OK.



34

00:02:26.910 --> 00:02:27.740

Best of luck.



35

00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.870

We'll go over the solution in the next lecture.
