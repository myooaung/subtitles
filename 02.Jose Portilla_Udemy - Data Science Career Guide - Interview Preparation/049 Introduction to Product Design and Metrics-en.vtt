Welcome to the product design and metrics interview questions section of the Course many times when



2

00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.880

it comes to the onsite stage of a data science interview the questions will start to be more open ended



3

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:21.590

and you're going to be asked to design or analyze possible products or features related to company metrics.



4

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:28.440

The best way to practice these questions is to literally talk out your thought process out loud because



5

00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.260

these questions are more open ended.



6

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.430

Don't take the provided solutions as the only possible correct answer if you're approaching these questions



7

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:36.470

with the right mindset.



8

00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:40.610

It should feel more like a conversation than a answer or monologue.



9

00:00:41.980 --> 00:00:43.420

Let's go ahead and get started.



10

00:00:43.420 --> 00:00:44.580

I'll see you at the first question.
