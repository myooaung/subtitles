Welcome to interview question about three design of experiments.

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:11,310
So here's the situation.

3
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:14,840
Facebook is testing different designs of their user home page.

4
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,220
They have come up with 50 variations.

5
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,120
They would like to test all of them and then choose the best.

6
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:22,880
How would you personally set up this sort of experiment.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:26,310
What metrics would you calculate and how would you report the results.

8
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:31,380
Keep in mind we're doing something that's a little different than just testing a Versus be here because

9
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:33,500
we're doing up to 50 variations.

10
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:36,800
So what kind of process should you use to set up this experiment.

11
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:41,100
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture where we go over an example solution.
