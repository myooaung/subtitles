00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:08.310

Welcome everyone to the work and with data using Eskew.



2

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:13.750

Interview Questions section of the course in almost every data science interview.



3

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:17.510

You're going to be tested in your knowledge of basic as well are basic sequel.



4

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:20.880

And typically this is done to test whether or not you know sequel.



5

00:00:20.890 --> 00:00:24.390

It's not really a test to check how advanced you are in sequel.



6

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:29.200

Again you should definitely check that job posting and see if they're really focusing in on sequel as



7

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.010

a skill.



8

00:00:30.010 --> 00:00:35.670

Maybe even mention specific flavors of sequel or a specific sequel engine but to some degree they really



9

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:40.570

want to test that you're able to do some sort of basic query because a lot of times you need to access



10

00:00:40.570 --> 00:00:43.670

that data as a data scientist.



11

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:47.230

We're going to start off with some simpler questions and then move on to harder ones.



12

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:51.450

So to start off we're basically going to be asking you what's wrong with a particular query.



13

00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:56.850

Later on we'll give you some images of tables and ask you to actually create a query and again take



14

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.690

careful note of job postings that require particular syntax of sequel.



15

00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:06.570

Sometimes if a job really requires something like Microsoft sequel server they may ask you specific



16

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:08.210

questions for that syntax.



17

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:09.370

Again that's a little more rare.



18

00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:12.570

It's usually general as cool questions but just keep that in mind.



19

00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:13.240

OK.



20

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.570

Our specific questions are going to be relatable to any major sequel engine.



21

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.050

Let's get started.



22

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:20.060

I'll see you at the first question.
