Welcome everyone to the solution for a sequel interview question number five.

2
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:14,340
So for this again we're considering these two tables below the Employees table in the manager's table.

3
00:00:14,440 --> 00:00:18,250
He needed to write a query that retrieves all employees that have no manager.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:22,570
And luckily since we're looking for employees that have no manager we actually don't even really need

5
00:00:22,570 --> 00:00:23,890
to consider the managers table.

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:25,860
We can do this without a joint.

7
00:00:26,230 --> 00:00:32,780
So the way we do that is we just say select name from employees where managed by is null.

8
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:38,860
Keep in mind certain sequel engines like my sequel post-crisis sequel Oracle databases Microsoft SQL

9
00:00:38,860 --> 00:00:39,580
Server.

10
00:00:39,700 --> 00:00:45,550
Sometimes there is slight variations or differences in how they approach actually calling a null value

11
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,460
from a column.

12
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:48,930
Sometimes it's not always just a keyboard a no.

13
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,070
Many times it is.

14
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:56,260
But keep in mind if the job posting is asking for a specific syntax of Eskew Well go ahead and double

15
00:00:56,260 --> 00:01:01,930
check to make sure that you know what keywords like null are for that particular Eskew or engine.

16
00:01:01,960 --> 00:01:05,440
In our case if you're just wipe Orting this should be totally fine.

17
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:08,110
Select name from employees were managed by is nil.

18
00:01:08,410 --> 00:01:09,190
OK.

19
00:01:09,190 --> 00:01:10,080
Hope you enjoyed that.

20
00:01:10,090 --> 00:01:11,320
I'll see you at the next lecture.
