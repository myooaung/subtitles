Welcome back to interview question number two for the probability theory section.



2

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:16.510

Here's the question What is the probability of rolling a total sum of four with two dice.



3

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.030

So you're given two dice.



4

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:20.150

You roll them add up the numbers.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:23.440

What's the probability that it's going to be 4.



6

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:24.330

Best of luck.



7

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:25.440
