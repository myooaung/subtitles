00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:10,560
Welcome to question the three for the statistics interview this question is actually pretty simple.

2
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:16,260
It's more of just a descriptive question and the question is what is the difference between a type 1

3
00:00:16,350 --> 00:00:18,720
versus a type 2 error.

4
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:22,830
What I would recommend for this question is that you tried a white board out your explanation so either

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:27,120
grab a piece of paper or if you have a little small whiteboard go ahead and wait for that out or try

6
00:00:27,120 --> 00:00:29,240
explaining that difference to a friend of yours.

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,820
Again what's the difference between a type 1 versus a type 2 air.

8
00:00:33,830 --> 00:00:35,540
Best of luck and we'll see what the solutions.
