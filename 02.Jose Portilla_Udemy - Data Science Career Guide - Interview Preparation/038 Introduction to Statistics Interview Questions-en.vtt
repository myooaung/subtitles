00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:10.670

Welcome everyone to the statistics interview questions section of the course.



2

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:15.270

So we're going to test your ability with statistics and keep in mind there is going to be some crossover



3

00:00:15.270 --> 00:00:17.190

here with just the basic probability.



4

00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:20.700

So you can expect a little bit of probability throughout these questions.



5

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:24.740

You should also note that a few of these questions will require knowledge of distributions.



6

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:28.640

Those are things like the normal distribution the binomial distribution etc..



7

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:31.370

So go ahead and use the resource guide book to help you out.



8

00:00:31.380 --> 00:00:36.180

In fact a few of the questions will actually require you to probably look something up in a table so



9

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:41.030

you can treat those as if they were a take home interview question or something of that sort.



10

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:43.320

All right let's get started.



11

00:00:43.320 --> 00:00:44.090

Best of luck.
