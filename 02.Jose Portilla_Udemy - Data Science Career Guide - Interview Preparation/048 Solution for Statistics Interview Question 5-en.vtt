00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:11.200

Welcome everyone to interview question number five for the statistics section of the course.



2

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:16.040

Now I would say this is definitely one of the most tricky questions in the section of the course and



3

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:20.840

that's probably because of the fact that you need to somehow map your understanding of the normal distribution



4

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:22.760

to a word problem.



5

00:00:22.760 --> 00:00:25.220

Now there are lots of hints here that help you out for that.



6

00:00:25.220 --> 00:00:29.170

But keep in mind it's not super clear and super obvious at first.



7

00:00:29.360 --> 00:00:33.290

So let's go out and take a closer look at this question we see here that we have the average life of



8

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.210

a certain type of motor is 10 years with a standard deviation of two years.



9

00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:41.450

So already there we can see that we're thinking in terms of a normal distribution.



10

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:47.330

We have an average life or mean in a normal distribution of 10 with a standard deviation that is the



11

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:49.340

sigma of two years.



12

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:54.660

Now if the manufacturer is willing to replace only 3 percent of the motors because of failures how long



13

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.320

a guarantee should she or he the manufacturer offer assume the lives of the motors following normal



14

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:02.430

distribution.



15

00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:07.200

So again to fully solve this we do need a z table so I told him to treat this as part of it take some



16

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:10.870

tasks so you can use those resources.



17

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:13.720

So let's go ahead and look up the valleys.



18

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:15.000

We're going to need a z table.



19

00:01:15.020 --> 00:01:17.190

Show you how to do that and solve this problem.



20

00:01:18.470 --> 00:01:23.060

So first off we're going to be using the standard normal curve which has a mean of zero and standard



21

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.230

deviation of one unit.



22

00:01:24.230 --> 00:01:26.870

So please remember that you have a normal distribution.



23

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:32.420

Here we have the minute zero stand the is one or sigma one with musical to zero.



24

00:01:32.510 --> 00:01:38.000

And what we can do given a standard normal distribution is we can transform all the observations of



25

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:44.180

any normal random variable x with mean myu and various Sigma to a new set of observations of another



26

00:01:44.180 --> 00:01:49.670

normal random variable z with mean zero and one using the following transformation.



27

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:54.840

Z is equal to that random variable x minus myu divided by Sigma.



28

00:01:54.950 --> 00:01:59.300

So the exact equation we're going to be using and we're going to plug some things in and try to solve



29

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:03.240

for how many years the guarantee should be.



30

00:02:03.430 --> 00:02:08.920

So here we're going to do is say X is the life of the motor and we're searching for that guarantee period



31

00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:14.890

and we'll call that small X. So really what we're searching for is where p of X less than x is equal



32

00:02:14.890 --> 00:02:20.770

to zero point zero or three and using a z table you can find out that the corresponding z score for



33

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:25.870

0.03 there is going to be z equals negative 1.8.



34

00:02:26.110 --> 00:02:31.450

So later on a little bit will show you how to look that up but for now once you have those results you



35

00:02:31.450 --> 00:02:35.970

know that the average lifespan is 10 years and seven standard deviations too.



36

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:39.720

So we have Z is equal to x minus over Sigma.



37

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.910

Plugging the numbers in.



38

00:02:40.930 --> 00:02:45.800

You get X minus 10 over 2 is equal to negative 1.8.



39

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:49.610

Solving that leads to x is equal to six point to four.



40

00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:53.200

So the guaranteed period should be six point to four years.



41

00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:57.010

We can see here mapped on a normal distribution itself.



42

00:02:57.190 --> 00:03:02.620

So basically what we're looking for is that corresponding the value of 6.2 for.



43

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:07.430

So let's go ahead and figure out what that z score is or how to look it up.



44

00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:10.600

How will we actually find out that negative 1.8.



45

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.730

And there's a really useful link called the Z table or Z that's table and we're going to go to that



46

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.290

right now.



47

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.480

It's also linked to you in your guide book.



48

00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:23.530

So let's take a look at that Web site which is essentially is the Z table with a lot of information.



49

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:27.350

OK here we are at this Zied dash table dot com Web site.



50

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:32.680

And if this Web sites were down you can always look up any normalcy table just google CSY table and



51

00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:34.780

you'll see something like this in Google images.



52

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:40.600

Those are really nice about this Web site is it has a Z score calculator you can use really easily here.



53

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:45.940

We're not exactly calculating the score directly like that but we're going to also show you how you



54

00:03:45.940 --> 00:03:52.240

can use the score table so what's really there says Step 1 step 2 etc. So actually shows you how you



55

00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:53.270

can do this.



56

00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.950

And what we're going to do is hop over the table and figure out what we need to know.



57

00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:02.120

So again we're looking for z here and this filled in the table entry.



58

00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:06.970

We know that's going to be needing to be equal to zero point zero or three.



59

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.000

So we're going to come over here and look up for these table entries.



60

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.380

The 0.03.



61

00:04:13.490 --> 00:04:19.100

So we'll come over here we see that there's point zero of three and if keep going down here all the



62

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:24.620

way on the right we see that there's point zero threes or a one we're going to go ahead and say it's



63

00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:25.320

close enough.



64

00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:28.840

Point 0 3 and then we look at the corresponding z score.



65

00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:32.100

So the first two digits are over here on the left hand side column.



66

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:39.350

We have one negative 1.8 and then grab that another decimal place to come up here and you see here that's



67

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:40.260

point zero.



68

00:04:40.330 --> 00:04:45.920

So you adding these together so that you end up getting negative one point eight eights and that's how



69

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:48.200

we actually grab that z score.



70

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.820

And I mean together may not be the right term to use you're basically kind of plugging that in.



71

00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.060

You're not really adding point 0 8 to negative 1.8.



72

00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.700

It's that you're just kind of tacking on that third decimal place number two negative 1.8.



73

00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:05.740

So that's how we got negative 1.8 as the corresponding z score.



74

00:05:05.780 --> 00:05:07.700

We went ahead as we knew the area.



75

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:13.790

We looked it up here first point 0 3 and then we saw negative 1.8 and we grabbed that final point 0



76

00:05:13.820 --> 00:05:14.350

8.



77

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:15.190

Okay.



78

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.670

So what's really nice about this Web site that's linked to your guide book that if you want more information



79

00:05:19.690 --> 00:05:24.480

you click here and how he uses the score table and they show you another example given an IQ test you



80

00:05:24.480 --> 00:05:29.800

convert of things Susy's score find the area corresponding to the score and then draw a valid conclusion.



81

00:05:29.810 --> 00:05:31.820

Here they're kind of going the other way around.



82

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:36.800

From what we did we essentially found the area first then found the corresponding z score and then we



83

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.050

know that a plug in to find X..



84

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:40.180

OK.



85

00:05:40.250 --> 00:05:46.970

So really useful website and this sort of problem isn't very common in an in-person or onsite interview



86

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:51.850

just because they're not really going to have a z score table ready for you but you may find that in



87

00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:56.840

some sort of take home test or even some sort of technical screening that's online.



88

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:58.430

So keep that in mind.



89

00:05:58.460 --> 00:05:58.800

Okay.



90

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.060

Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
