00:00:05.630 --> 00:00:06.520

Welcome back everyone.



2

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:12.450

The solution for machine learning Question number four so this question was what advantages the decision



3

00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:13.700

tree model have.



4

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:18.730

So there are actually a ton of advantages to decision trees and you can check out lots of links in the



5

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:23.980

guidebook where people list off basically like 20 advantages of decision trees.



6

00:00:23.980 --> 00:00:26.260

But I would say these are the main ones to get down.



7

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.150

So the first one is that they're very easy to interpret and understand.



8

00:00:29.170 --> 00:00:35.260

Basically anyone can just go up to a board draw decision tree or you can just see a decision tree written



9

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.210

down on a piece of paper and understand how it's working.



10

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:40.310

It's very easy to interpret.



11

00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:44.830

It also works really nicely on both continuous features and categorical features.



12

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:51.040

Other algorithms have issues with categorical features or continuous features being too largely scaled



13

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.000

against each other.



14

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:54.640

So decision tree doesn't need to worry about that stuff.



15

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.120

And that brings us to our third point.



16

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.570

We're really no normalization or scaling is actually necessary because each individual feature is considered



17

00:01:01.630 --> 00:01:06.680

separately from the other ones due to the way the node structure on the decision tree works.



18

00:01:06.680 --> 00:01:11.020

What's also really nice about a decision tree is that the prediction algorithm runs very fast and it



19

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:16.020

can work on a really large dataset relatively quickly compared to some other algorithms.



20

00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.240

So those are the key advantages of the entries.



21

00:01:18.250 --> 00:01:21.530

You can check out the links in the guide book if you're looking for more.



22

00:01:21.610 --> 00:01:23.180

Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
