Welcome everyone to the solution for a school interview question three.



2

00:00:10.330 --> 00:00:12.410

So this is another check what's wrong with a query.



3

00:00:12.410 --> 00:00:18.530

So here we're saying select user id average on the total column as average order total from invoices



4

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:22.620

having account Order ID greater than or equal to one.



5

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:24.160

So what's the problem here.



6

00:00:24.350 --> 00:00:29.810

Well notice that if we take a look at this we have a select statement from statement having statement



7

00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:32.300

and we're calling an average on the total.



8

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.360

Unfortunately here though we forgot the group by statement.



9

00:00:36.380 --> 00:00:40.000

So we're using having and we're using an average function.



10

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.650

However there's no company group by statement.



11

00:00:42.770 --> 00:00:45.480

So in other words that's what the school statement was missing.



12

00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:50.390

The actual group byline OK thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
