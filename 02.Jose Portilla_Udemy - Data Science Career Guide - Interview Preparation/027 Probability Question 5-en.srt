00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:12,330
Welcome to interview question number five for the probability theory section of the course.

2
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:19,950
So if the probability of seeing a car on a highway in 30 minutes is 95 percent chance or 0.9 5.

3
00:00:20,110 --> 00:00:25,930
The question is what is the probability of seeing a car on the highway in 10 minutes and you can assume

4
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:28,350
a constant default probability.

5
00:00:28,360 --> 00:00:34,690
So again in other words the question is if you're just sitting down at an empty highway for 30 minutes

6
00:00:34,780 --> 00:00:38,450
and the odds of seeing a car go by it is point nine five.

7
00:00:38,740 --> 00:00:40,460
If you only sat for 10 minutes.

8
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,050
What is the probability of seeing a car on that same highway.

9
00:00:44,050 --> 00:00:44,440
All right.

10
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:46,290
Best of luck and I'll see you at the solutions.
