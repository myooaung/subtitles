00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:09.310

Welcome everyone to the solution for Interview Question number two in the product design and metrics



2

00:00:09.310 --> 00:00:11.150

category.



3

00:00:11.170 --> 00:00:16.150

So this is the one where we're describing different aspects of the same situation where Google has released



4

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.680

a new version of their search algorithm.



5

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:22.990

They did some AB testing and during that testing the engineers realized that the new algorithm was actually



6

00:00:23.110 --> 00:00:28.060

incorrectly implemented and it was returning less relevant results which is not good.



7

00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:29.550

Now two things were happening here.



8

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.850

People in the treatment group were performing more queries in the control group.



9

00:00:33.010 --> 00:00:36.770

And also interestingly advertising revenue was higher in the treatment group as well.



10

00:00:36.910 --> 00:00:39.490

Even though there were less relevant results.



11

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:43.990

So the first question was what may be the cause of people in the treatment group performing more searches



12

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:47.040

than the control group.



13

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:49.410

Now keep in mind lots of different possible answers here.



14

00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:53.610

If you have a good interviewer This should be more of a conversation than just a one way dialogue or



15

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:54.720

one way monologue.



16

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:57.400

So here's what we do know.



17

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.710

We know the new algorithm is producing less relevant search results and if we kind of think about this



18

00:01:03.070 --> 00:01:08.500

this means that users may have to make additional searches in order to clarify what they are searching



19

00:01:08.500 --> 00:01:08.830

for.



20

00:01:08.860 --> 00:01:15.420

Using the new algorithm in order to test this hypothesis will be could do a study how close searches



21

00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:16.890

are to each other.



22

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:21.960

So if we notice that additional searchers are being done very soon after a previous search we could



23

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.900

classify them as clarifying searches.



24

00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.320

So what I mean by that is let's say you were searching for Apple computers.



25

00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:34.230

So you go to Google you search for Apple and it keeps giving you Apple the fruit.



26

00:01:34.260 --> 00:01:36.390

So this is not the relevant result that you wanted.



27

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:40.350

In fact more people are probably searching for Apple computers than Apple to fruit.



28

00:01:40.350 --> 00:01:45.470

So maybe you have to quickly clarify the search to Apple computer or Apple Mac books etc..



29

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:51.120

So what we can do to test this hypothesis is start measuring the time between queries into the search



30

00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:55.830

engine and then we can actually get some sort of measurement are these clarifying searches are happening



31

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:58.140

happening immediately after the first search.



32

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:02.820

Or are people just querying more in general using this new algorithm.



33

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:04.730

So that's something really important to keep in mind here.



34

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:11.790

More queries does not mean that the new algorithm is better or worse it just means that it's different.



35

00:02:11.790 --> 00:02:16.680

What we have to do is look at this analytically and the side is it better or worse given what we do



36

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:21.120

know and most likely since we do know that it's giving less relevant results.



37

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:26.220

It's likely that people are doing more queries and trying to clarify the results because the ones being



38

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.220

returned are in fact less relevant.



39

00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:30.680

Okay thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
