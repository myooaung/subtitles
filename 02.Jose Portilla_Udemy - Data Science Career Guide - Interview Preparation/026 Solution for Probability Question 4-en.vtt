00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:12.060

Welcome back everyone to the solution for probability Interview Question number four.



2

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:17.350

So just to review this question you had to jar's 50 red marbles and 50 blue marbles and you needed to



3

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:22.660

place all the marbles into the jars such that when you blindly pick one marble out of one randomly chosen



4

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:25.500

jar you maximize the chances that it will be red.



5

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:28.260

So how do we actually do this.



6

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:33.740

Well let's label the jars number one and number two in jar number 1.



7

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:39.170

You can go ahead and place just one red marble and then place all the rest of the marbles into a jar.



8

00:00:39.170 --> 00:00:42.570

Number two then the outcome red versus blue.



9

00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:44.350

It's going to take two steps.



10

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:51.160

First there are 50 50 odds or a 50 percent chance that your friend is going to select door number one.



11

00:00:51.470 --> 00:00:55.970

So if he does select juror number one then there's a 100 percent chance of a red outcome since there's



12

00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.960

only one red marble to pick from in that first jar.



13

00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.890

Then there's also a 50 percent chance that he will choose Jarre to instead.



14

00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:10.790

If your friend picks Juror number two then there are 49 to 50 odds or 49 out of ninety nine which is



15

00:01:10.790 --> 00:01:16.530

going to be forty nine point four nine for nine repeating percent chance of choosing red.



16

00:01:16.690 --> 00:01:21.370

So on a single trial the odds of picking a red marble outcome is as follows.



17

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:26.950

First there's the 100 percent probability multiplied by the half chance of choosing your number one



18

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.440

then you're going to add the probability for the second char which is going to be picking the red marble



19

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:37.300

out of the rest of them which is going to be for nine out of ninety nine marbles multiplied by the one



20

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.250

half chance of picking that char.



21

00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:43.750

So that gives you seventy four point seventy five percent chance and that's the way you can maximize



22

00:01:43.750 --> 00:01:46.110

your chances of picking the red marble.



23

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:51.040

It's a bit of a tricky question because sometimes intuitively you just think oh I will split them and



24

00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:54.760

the best chances I have are 50 50.



25

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.790

You can actually increase your chances by just taking that red marble and putting it into a single jar.



26

00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:05.050

That way you basically lock up that jar as a 100 percent red pick and you don't have to worry about



27

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:08.090

that anymore with the rest of them being in the other jar.



28

00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.600

So again this is the best way you can maximize your chances of picking a red marble.



29

00:02:13.230 --> 00:02:15.240

Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
