Welcome to interview question three for product design and Metrix.



2

00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:14.300

So again same situation here where Google released a new version of their search algorithm that did



3

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:15.770

some AB testing.



4

00:00:15.770 --> 00:00:17.690

There was a problem with the new algorithm.



5

00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:23.750

It was returning less relevant results and the two things that were occurring was people with that treatment



6

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:28.530

group they performed more queries and advertising revenue was higher for the treatment group.



7

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.150

So the second question regarding the situation is what do you think caused the new algorithm to generate



8

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:41.560

more advertising revenue even though the results were supposedly less relevant.



9

00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:46.960

Okay we'll go ahead and discuss a possible solution for this in the next lecture.
