00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:09.230

Welcome back everyone to the solution for Interview Question number three.



2

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:12.230

And these statistics section of the course.



3

00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:16.830

So this is actually a really basic question it's more of a discussion question and it's asking what's



4

00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:21.090

the difference between type 1 versus type 2 error.



5

00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:28.760

So we're going to frame this in the terms of a hypothesis test then type 1 error is the false positive



6

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.750

and type 2 error is the false negative.



7

00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:36.540

So let's go ahead and discuss these errors specifically in terms of the null hypothesis.



8

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.790

A type 1 error occurs when the null hypothesis is true.



9

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:48.330

But you ended up actually rejecting it and it is asserting something that is absent essentially a false



10

00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:50.790

hit which is why it's called a false positive.



11

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:51.700

So a type 1 error.



12

00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:54.880

It's also called a false positive basically a result.



13

00:00:54.890 --> 00:01:02.070

In the case that a given condition is present when it's actually not present now a type 2 error occurs



14

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.340

when the null hypothesis was actually false but erroneously fails to be rejected.



15

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.900

And notice I'm using the terms fails to be rejected.



16

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:13.670

You should be using that specific phrase fails to be rejected.



17

00:01:14.070 --> 00:01:16.760

It is failing to assert what is present or a miss.



18

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:22.440

And this is why it's also called a false negative or an actual hit was disregarded by the test and seen



19

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.430

as a miss in a test checking for a single condition with some sort of definitive result of true or false



20

00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.700

so let's go ahead and go over some examples in terms of hypothesis and null hypothesis.



21

00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:41.210

So let's say our hypothesis is adding water to toothpaste protects against cavities.



22

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:47.460

And the null hypothesis is then adding water to toothpaste has no effect on cavities.



23

00:01:47.790 --> 00:01:53.580

So this no hypothesis is tested against experimental data with a view to nullifying it with evidence



24

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:54.650

to the contrary.



25

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:01.790

So a type 1 error occurs when detecting an effect such as adding water to toothpaste protects against



26

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.540

cavities.



27

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:04.340

That is not actually present.



28

00:02:04.430 --> 00:02:06.740

Remember that's the false positive.



29

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:09.160

The null hypothesis is true.



30

00:02:09.230 --> 00:02:12.740

For example it is true that adding water toothpaste has no effect on cavities.



31

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.980

But this null hypothesis is rejected based on bad experimental data.



32

00:02:18.780 --> 00:02:21.770

Let's look at an example for the type to air.



33

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:26.340

Let's say our hypothesis was adding fluoride to toothpaste protects against cavities.



34

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:31.110

And the no hypothesis was adding fluoride toothpaste has no effect on cavities.



35

00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:36.420

So there's no hypothesis test against experimental data with a view of nullifying it with evidence to



36

00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.450

the contrary.



37

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:44.110

If a type 2 occurs when failing to detect an effect that is adding fluoride to base protects against



38

00:02:44.110 --> 00:02:48.490

cavities that is present the null hypothesis is false.



39

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:50.990

Adding fluoride is actually effective against cavities.



40

00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.020

But the experimental data such that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected.



41

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.070

So again I have a type 2 error or a false negative.



42

00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:04.480

So everything we just said before are really formal explanations in terms of hypothesis testing of what



43

00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:07.300

type 1 error is versus the type 2 error.



44

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.610

But if in case you ever want to just simplify things or have an easier way to remember the differences



45

00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:18.100

between type on error and type 2 error I really like this pretty funny image here of indicating a false



46

00:03:18.100 --> 00:03:19.800

positive versus a false negative.



47

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.940

So we can see here.



48

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.540

Here we have a man and the doctor saying you're pregnant.



49

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:25.350

So we definitely have a false positive.



50

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:31.420

We're seeing that some sort of hypothesis is true that the pregnancy was there when in fact it actually



51

00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:36.310

wasn't a false positive there and then and type 2 error we have a false negative.



52

00:03:36.310 --> 00:03:41.080

So here we see a woman who's clearly pregnant and the doctor saying you're not pregnant.



53

00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:46.630

So we have some sort of situation where we were testing for a condition and that happens to be true



54

00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:50.620

but we accidentally took it as not true.



55

00:03:50.620 --> 00:03:53.860

So that's different than a false positive and a false negative.



56

00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:54.640

OK.



57

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.540

Go ahead and check out the resources in the guidebook in case you're still a little more confused on



58

00:03:58.540 --> 00:04:01.090

type 1 error or type 2 error.



59

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:05.730

Honestly it's usually more useful to think of them in terms of false positive or false negative.



60

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.360

And I hope this image serves as a funny but useful reminder of that.



61

00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:11.020

Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
