00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:11.120

Welcome back everyone to this lecture on tools of the trade we're going to discuss just a few technical



2

00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:14.140

tools that people use and the data science industry.



3

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:19.400

So these are things like actual programming languages general frameworks and then also higher level



4

00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.610

software tools.



5

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000

So let's start off the basics programming languages.



6

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:29.560

So typically when you're doing a data scientist interview you're going to have to do some sort of coding



7

00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.300

in a programming language.



8

00:00:31.300 --> 00:00:37.690

Now these can go all the way from lower level languages such as C or C++ and Java to higher level languages



9

00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.110

such as Python or are now in the data science community.



10

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:43.500

Python and are definitely the most popular.



11

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:46.390

But again it really depends on what kind of role you're looking at.



12

00:00:46.390 --> 00:00:51.610

A lot of times if you're looking more for a role in the machine learning aspects of things or the data



13

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:56.290

engineering aspect of things you have to deal with lower level languages and then as you get more to



14

00:00:56.530 --> 00:01:01.840

the analysis side of the spectrum you end up dealing more with Python and R and a lot of times you'll



15

00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.850

have to know a little bit of everything especially things like sequel which are just general languages



16

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.520

for queering So those are the programming languages.



17

00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:14.130

Next we're going to have to know about frameworks and libraries.



18

00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.150

And these are actually going to depend on what your main programming languages.



19

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.240

So if you're interviewing as a data scientist and the position asked for knowledge in Python you should



20

00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:27.140

know the frameworks and libraries that are used in Python.



21

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:32.670

Now for instance machine learning frameworks for Python the most popular one is sikat learn.



22

00:01:32.670 --> 00:01:36.690

So the interviewer is probably going to expect you to know that if you're working with something like



23

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:42.240

Sparke they're going to expect to know what Madlib the machine learning library for Sparc is.



24

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:45.880

A lot of times there's a lot of other libraries depending on what language you're using.



25

00:01:46.050 --> 00:01:50.700

So again if you're using Python they're going to expect you to know things like Pancho's nut pie if



26

00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:57.990

you're working with are on other machine learning packages that are really popular are such as G-G plot



27

00:01:57.990 --> 00:01:58.290

too.



28

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:02.610

That's a visualization package that they'll probably expect you to know and things of that nature.



29

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:07.800

So you'll have to know not just the programming language but when you start diving deeper into whatever



30

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:11.640

language you prefer they'll expect you to know the most popular frameworks.



31

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:15.330

And if you've already dealt with these languages before you probably already are familiar with these



32

00:02:15.330 --> 00:02:21.440

frameworks and other higher level up from that is software tools.



33

00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:27.570

Now this really depends on the company and the position itself but sometimes beyond programming languages



34

00:02:27.870 --> 00:02:30.030

they'll expect you to work with software tools.



35

00:02:30.030 --> 00:02:32.850

And typically this is more in the analyst's position.



36

00:02:32.850 --> 00:02:37.680

So if you're looking at things like a business intelligence analyst or just a business analyst in general



37

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:43.580

or even a data analyst they work a lot more with software tools than programming languages themselves.



38

00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:48.930

So these are things like Tablo or H2O and some of these other services you may have heard of before.



39

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:53.820

Now keep in mind software tools come out all the time and a lot of times these companies are acquired



40

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:54.660

very quickly.



41

00:02:54.840 --> 00:03:01.770

So this list will change basically year to year as far as what the current trends are in software tools



42

00:03:01.830 --> 00:03:08.290

in the data science ecosystem now that we've gone over the three main levels of these tools of the trade.



43

00:03:08.340 --> 00:03:13.530

The first being the lower level of programming languages then one level up as frameworks and one level



44

00:03:13.530 --> 00:03:15.740

on top of that as general software tools.



45

00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.460

We want to figure out a strategy for picking which tools that you should study and become an expert



46

00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.280

in.



47

00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.740

And I would highly recommend that you just pick one programming language at first and learn it very



48

00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:26.360

well.



49

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.740

So for example you can just pick Python learn that very well learn the various frameworks for well such



50

00:03:31.740 --> 00:03:34.080

as Panchos and non-pilots I could learn.



51

00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:39.670

And then once you understand that then you can expand off to other programming languages.



52

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.990

Interviewers really like a expertise in one language and the ability to have those general skills in



53

00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:50.880

a programming language that you can then relate to the programming languages such as are or sequel or



54

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:55.230

other programming languages because really at the end of the day it's just a syntax change.



55

00:03:55.230 --> 00:04:00.090

Being a good programmer in one language usually means you're a good programmer in other languages as



56

00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:01.330

you pick up the syntax.



57

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:06.240

So that's really what interviewers look for in a lot of times company projects are going to switch frameworks



58

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:07.860

or switch languages.



59

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:11.610

So it's really important they have that general skill set.



60

00:04:11.610 --> 00:04:15.840

So again once you have that one language expertise then you can begin to expand to different languages



61

00:04:16.110 --> 00:04:18.700

and begin to become that T-shaped candidate.



62

00:04:19.080 --> 00:04:24.000

So you're also going to want to look up what specific tools are being used in your preferred companies



63

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.310

so that can help you pick that one language.



64

00:04:26.310 --> 00:04:30.570

Now if I had to recommend one language to pick if you were just starting off I would recommend either



65

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:36.750

Python or R and currently Python seems to be the most popular and most trending as far as language is



66

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:38.750

used in the data science ecosystem.



67

00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:43.890

But again maybe look up your preferred company jobless things and see what tools are being used.



68

00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:48.020

Some companies tend to exclusively use just one programming language such as are.



69

00:04:48.090 --> 00:04:52.000

So let's go ahead and take a look at what a example job posting would look like.



70

00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:57.270

This is actually from a job posting on you to me for a data science position so we can see here what



71

00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:58.980

qualifications are looking for.



72

00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.090

There are things like the years of experience in some sort of analytical or data science space.



73

00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:07.940

Then there's experiment with analyzing Abts.



74

00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:12.810

And then if you look at that fourth bullet point they say skill that extracting them manipulating large



75

00:05:12.810 --> 00:05:18.160

data sets using Eskew or sequel in a statistical language such as our or Python.



76

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:21.690

So you can see here they're only asking for two things.



77

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.170

One is that you have general knowledge of sequel or as well.



78

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:30.640

And that's going to be pretty much across the board for any sort of analyst position sequel.



79

00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:35.190

And as you all are definitely still the main types of ways that you interface with some sort of data



80

00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:36.000

warehouse.



81

00:05:36.030 --> 00:05:38.080

So you're pretty much always going to have to know that.



82

00:05:38.250 --> 00:05:42.420

But then once you actually get your data you're going to want to analyze it with face artistical language



83

00:05:42.670 --> 00:05:46.920

and here you can see this company is flexible either are or Python because they know that if you're



84

00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:50.890

good at are you'll be able to easily switch to Python and vice versa.



85

00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:54.840

Then some sort of familiarity with advanced visualization tools.



86

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.810

And if you're familiar are python and worked with them they do science.



87

00:05:57.810 --> 00:06:02.250

Hopefully you already understand some of the visualization frameworks such as Ju-Ju plot to for our



88

00:06:02.490 --> 00:06:04.480

or that plot live for Python.



89

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:09.510

And then the rest of these bullet points are basically just more generalized things such as being able



90

00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:11.340

to think strong mentality.



91

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:13.230

A teamwork mindset etc..



92

00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:16.560

Hopefully that gives you an idea of what to look for in a job posting.



93

00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.720

So if this was your dream company and dream job you would know that you would need to cover as well



94

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:27.600

and you would also need to become a really good skilled programmer in either or Python you don't necessarily



95

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.450

have to know both.



96

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.080

OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
