00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:10.240

Hello everyone and welcome to the solution to see first mystics interview question.



2

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.850

And this is the one where you're going to go to Seattle you called three random friends who lived there



3

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:18.150

and ask each of them independently if it's raining or not.



4

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.820

This is actually a question that used to get asked at Facebook and as a quick note when they were asking



5

00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.750

Facebook they actually wouldn't tell you the 25 percent chance it's raining on any given day in Seattle.



6

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:33.600

Instead you would have to make an assumption of what's the probability it's raining on any given day



7

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.290

in Seattle or ask your interviewer for that.



8

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:39.310

So we simplified it a little bit by actually giving that probability.



9

00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:43.950

But keep in mind in a real interview setting you may have to make some assumptions or ask your interviewer



10

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.400

if it's OK to make certain assumptions.



11

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.010

So let's try to figure out the probability it's actually raining in Seattle given that all three of



12

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.790

these friends said yes.



13

00:00:53.620 --> 00:00:57.910

So there are really only two situations where the friends can all say yes.



14

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:02.500

So if all the friends said yes that means it could be raining and that means they're all telling the



15

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:03.380

truth.



16

00:01:03.400 --> 00:01:08.220

So the probability of each of them telling the truth happens two thirds of the time.



17

00:01:08.230 --> 00:01:13.420

So all three are telling a truth has a probability of two over three to the power of three you're multiplying



18

00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.630

two thirds for each friend.



19

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:22.000

And that is equal to 8 over 27 the other possible situation is it's not raining in Seattle and that



20

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.940

means if all three of them said yes they're all lying.



21

00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:28.310

So recall that each Sly's one third of the time.



22

00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:34.360

So all three lie has a probability of one third one third one third or one third cube which is equal



23

00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:36.870

to 1 over 27.



24

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:42.140

So here's a probability theory of the situation and this probability tree assumes that no rain and rain



25

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.930

are equally likely in Seattle on any given day.



26

00:01:44.990 --> 00:01:49.700

Later on we'll see how to generalize that to any probability of raining in Seattle but if we just take



27

00:01:49.700 --> 00:01:55.260

a look at this probably tree here we can see that the probability that they all say yes given that they



28

00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:58.940

are lying is one over 27 probability that they all say yes.



29

00:01:58.970 --> 00:02:03.040

Given that it's truthful is 8 over 27.



30

00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.830

So the event that all three say yes happens one third of the time and this particular probability tree



31

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:16.360

because we're seeing eight over 27 plus 127 happens one time out of these times there's an eight point



32

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.370

nine percent chance that it's actually raining because it's going to be eight of the 27 member their



33

00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:22.260

ultimate truth.



34

00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:27.290

Divided by the total times of the event with all three of them say yes which is one third.



35

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:31.710

So that gives you eight or nine or one ninth chance that it's not raining.



36

00:02:32.490 --> 00:02:38.150

So that's what you do for a general case where rain and no rain are equally likely.



37

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.210

However we actually know that the probability of it raining on any given day was not 50 50.



38

00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:46.160

So let's go ahead and define a general case tree.



39

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:51.810

We're going to say that the probability that it's raining on any given day in Seattle is P which means



40

00:02:51.810 --> 00:02:54.880

the probability of it's not raining is 1 minus p.



41

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:57.240

And here we can go along our probability tree.



42

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:01.020

We can check out the guidebook in case you're unfamiliar with these kind of probability trees they're



43

00:03:01.020 --> 00:03:03.320

really useful when you're sketching out on a white board.



44

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:08.280

But continuing on here we just go ahead and multiply one minus three times probability that they're



45

00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:09.270

all lying.



46

00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.730

So we have all of them say yes and they're lying as one minus twenty seven all of them say yes.



47

00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:18.880

And it's actually raining is eight times over 27.



48

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:25.810

So this means the probability that they all say yes for any situation using this P is going to be equal



49

00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:35.290

to 8 over twenty seven plus eight times one minus 27 which is equal to 7 p plus 1 over 27 or P again



50

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:39.010

is a probability that on any given day it's raining in Seattle.



51

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:43.950

Which means that out of those times it was actually raining.



52

00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:48.220

We end up doing the same mathematics we did before AP over 27.



53

00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:54.540

Divided by 7 p plus 1 over 27 which is then equal to 8 p over 7 plus 1.



54

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:58.200

Just some fractional math there that's going on.



55

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:04.890

If we take that equation and plug in what we do know which is P is equal to 0.25 plug then into 8 over



56

00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:11.340

7 p plus 1 that results in around 0.72 chance that it's actually raining in Seattle.



57

00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:18.650

Given that all of your friends said yes OK this is a really complex problem that can be simplified.



58

00:04:18.690 --> 00:04:21.490

We use this strategy of these probability trees.



59

00:04:21.510 --> 00:04:25.640

So definitely check out the guidebook for more information on using probability trees.



60

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.660

It's a really useful tool especially when you have a white board handy.



61

00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.290

OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
