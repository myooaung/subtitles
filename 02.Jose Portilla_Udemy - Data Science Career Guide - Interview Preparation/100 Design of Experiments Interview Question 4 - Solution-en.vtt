00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:10.270

Welcome back for the solution for design of experiments Question number four Remember this question



2

00:00:10.280 --> 00:00:10.800

was asking.



3

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.130

What's the definition of power for a statistical test and what factors affect the power and how does



4

00:00:16.130 --> 00:00:19.380

the power relate to the P-value.



5

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:25.440

So the power of any test of statistical significance is defined as the probability that it will reject



6

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:27.840

a false null hypothesis.



7

00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:34.360

So statistical power is inversely related to beta or the probability of making a type 2 error.



8

00:00:34.590 --> 00:00:40.580

So in short power is equal to 1 minus beta statistical power.



9

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:45.930

Again is the likelihood that a study will detect that effect when there is an effect there to be detected.



10

00:00:46.260 --> 00:00:52.020

If statistical power is high the probability of making it type 2 error are concluding there is no effect.



11

00:00:52.130 --> 00:00:55.040

When in fact there was one goes down.



12

00:00:55.040 --> 00:01:00.600

So again it's the statistical power is high the probability of making a type 2 error goes down.



13

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:08.420

Statistical power is affected chiefly by the size of the effect and the size of the sample being used



14

00:01:08.420 --> 00:01:14.420

to detect bigger effects are easier to the tech than smaller effects while large samples offer greater



15

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:16.730

test sensitivity than small samples.



16

00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:23.660

So if you perform a test the P-value is the smallest Alpha for which the tests will reject the null



17

00:01:23.660 --> 00:01:24.870

hypothesis.



18

00:01:24.890 --> 00:01:29.690

It is of value the significance level for which the tests are autistic would have been on the boundary



19

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:36.380

of the rejection region then by comparing the value of the Type 1 error we can decide if we're going



20

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:42.680

to reject the null hypothesis if we see a larger Alpha we then in turn allow for larger p values to



21

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:47.450

be considered significant meaning we increase the power of the test.



22

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:53.780

And that's the basic idea behind how you calculate power how powers the fine number it's 1 minus beta



23

00:01:54.140 --> 00:01:56.650

and also how power is related to p values.



24

00:01:56.690 --> 00:02:01.880

In general this is definitely something that's kind of hard to comprehend the first especially I believe



25

00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:03.020

in a video format.



26

00:02:03.050 --> 00:02:09.050

It's a lot easier to just take the time sit down and read through the definition of statistical hypothesis



27

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:15.710

testing and how alpha beta power or type 1 error's type 2 hours and p values are all related to each



28

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:16.140

other.



29

00:02:16.220 --> 00:02:17.870

Definitely take your time with this one.



30

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.980

It's going to be extremely important for certain job postings and a lot of times you're going to be



31

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.210

just grilled on your understanding of hypothesis testing.



32

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:25.690

OK.



33

00:02:25.850 --> 00:02:26.600

Thanks everyone.



34

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.590

Hope that was helpful.



35

00:02:27.590 --> 00:02:30.100

Definitely check out the resources in the guide book for this one.



36

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:30.570

I'll see it there.
