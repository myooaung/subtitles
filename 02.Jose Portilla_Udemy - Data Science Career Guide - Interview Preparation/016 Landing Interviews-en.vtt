00:00:05.590 --> 00:00:12.190

Welcome everyone to this lecture on landing interviews earlier you mentioned that there is a well-reported



2

00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.960

shortage of good data scientists in the industry.



3

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:21.530

However there's often a lot more applicants than ever for each individual job which means you're going



4

00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:25.970

to find yourself applying to many many jobs and in a very competitive landscape.



5

00:00:25.970 --> 00:00:32.180

So let's go ahead and discuss what the general pipeline looks like for applying to jobs in landing an



6

00:00:32.180 --> 00:00:32.980

interview.



7

00:00:33.290 --> 00:00:37.440

And we're going to take this more from the approach that this is your first data scientist position.



8

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:42.780

As you already have a data scientist position and then begin the plant the jobs often.



9

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:47.000

Once you work as a data scientist the offers end up coming to you instead of you having to seek them



10

00:00:47.060 --> 00:00:47.560

out.



11

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.180

So keep in mind this sort of pipeline is for your very first data scientist position after you've studied



12

00:00:53.180 --> 00:00:54.880

after you have projects et cetera.



13

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.300

So let's go ahead and look at what the interview funnel may look like for you.



14

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.270

So this is what the interview funnel typically looks like for people who are applying for the first



15

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:11.000

data scientist position and at the top here as your actual job applications you're going to find yourself



16

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:15.680

applying anywhere from 100 to 200 job applications usually closer to 100.



17

00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.910

But it depends if you're applying to multiple cities that number may grow up to 200 job applications.



18

00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.780

And as you can imagine that is a ton of job applications so it's going to take you know one two three



19

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:28.880

weeks to actually go through all these applications.



20

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.200

Figure out companies and you're going to start off with the companies that are your top choices then



21

00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:35.980

top city choices and eventually go down down.



22

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:41.900

But expect to do a ton of job applications and these job applications you're going to realize you're



23

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:46.970

going into using multiple paths you're going to do some of them either cold applications straight on



24

00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:51.330

the Web site or hopefully in other applications will be your network etc..



25

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.270

After those job applications you can expect to have anywhere between 30 and 50 phone screens depending



26

00:01:56.270 --> 00:01:58.900

on how many job applications you actually did.



27

00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.000

So maybe somewhere around the 25 percent range of those actually go to a phone screen that may be a



28

00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.350

little high especially if it's your first data scientist position it really depends on your background



29

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.270

how good your resume is etc..



30

00:02:11.810 --> 00:02:16.490

After that you can expect about half of those to go through a technical screen.



31

00:02:16.490 --> 00:02:19.730

Again depends on how well your phone screen went with the recruiter.



32

00:02:19.730 --> 00:02:25.100

After that probably another half of those are going to go to take home tasks and then after that maybe



33

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.250

a third of those are half of those are going to go onsite.



34

00:02:27.260 --> 00:02:33.720

So you can see here eventually each of these gets diminished more and more so as we just saw it's going



35

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:38.030

to take many applications just to begin to actually even get a job offer.



36

00:02:38.310 --> 00:02:40.820

And I want to make sure you're not discouraged by these numbers.



37

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:44.460

You may have been kind of overwhelmed that the fact that you have to apply to so many jobs.



38

00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:49.770

But keep in mind even really great engineers really great product managers and really great data scientists



39

00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:52.830

get rejected all the time for no good reason.



40

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.640

It's actually well-documented problem within the technology space in general that the actual interview



41

00:02:59.640 --> 00:03:03.590

process often just rejects really great candidates.



42

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.310

Straight out the gate.



43

00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:11.630

So for example you have here some tweets and you may be wondering Who are these people.



44

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:14.380

Well you can see on the bottom right there is Max Howell.



45

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.340

And here he is sending a tweet that he's complaining.



46

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:24.030

He's actually the person who wrote homebrew with which if you've ever used some sort of technical programming



47

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:27.120

language on Mac OS you're probably familiar of homebrew.



48

00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:30.720

It's a really popular way to install software onto a Mac.



49

00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.800

So he wrote it and a ton of Engineers use it.



50

00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:38.630

Basically any software engineer that's using Mac has at least heard of homebrew and more likely they



51

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:39.390

are using it.



52

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:45.170

You can see here he's complaining that he wasn't able to do a very specific data structure task on a



53

00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:45.820

white board.



54

00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:48.110

So I've censored the rest of it.



55

00:03:48.190 --> 00:03:50.920

And so he was rejected from Google.



56

00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.560

Now there's also the case of Brian Akten and he was invited by both Twitter and Facebook.



57

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:02.130

And if you're wondering who he is he's actually one of the co-founders of what's app and Facebook later



58

00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:04.980

acquired WhatsApp for billions of dollars.



59

00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.970

So even these two fantastic candidates got rejected.



60

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:13.980

And one of them even went to go on to create a company that would later get acquired by the very same



61

00:04:13.980 --> 00:04:16.200

company he was rejected from earlier.



62

00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:22.110

So again since you know that you're gonna need to apply to many positions.



63

00:04:22.140 --> 00:04:26.250

Let's go ahead and learn some good strategies for finding available positions as well as the best way



64

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:33.300

to initiate the sort of contact in asking for a position so the very first thing you can do is use your



65

00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:33.770

network.



66

00:04:33.780 --> 00:04:39.030

And this is by far the most effective approach you can use your family your friends contacts on linked



67

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:41.820

in to check for available positions.



68

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:46.560

These sort of connections that get your resume in the Hanover recruiter are going to be the most effective



69

00:04:46.650 --> 00:04:52.710

approach and are going to have the highest probability of actually going through to a recruiter screening



70

00:04:52.710 --> 00:04:54.180

or a technical screening.



71

00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:56.910

So you always want to leverage your network as best as you can.



72

00:04:58.340 --> 00:05:03.740

You may be wondering well I how much of a network how to expand the personal projects are a really great



73

00:05:03.740 --> 00:05:08.190

way to expand your network or participating in competitions like those hosted on Kaggle.



74

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:11.760

That's another great way to expand your network and get your name out there get you noticed.



75

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:17.060

People began connecting a few especially if you start thing blog posts you'll end up getting LinkedIn



76

00:05:17.150 --> 00:05:21.100

invitations or connections if you want in-person expansionary network.



77

00:05:21.110 --> 00:05:23.040

I would also recommend that you check up meet ups.



78

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:27.640

There's tons of meet ups for things like Python for data science are using are for data science or in



79

00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:31.730

things like Big Data meet ups etc. especially if you live in a larger city.



80

00:05:31.730 --> 00:05:35.930

Those are really great opportunities to actually network in person and a lot of people going to the



81

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:40.830

meet ups are recruiters or managers looking to recruit people onto their team.



82

00:05:43.490 --> 00:05:47.180

Now if you cant find anyone in your network and you were able to expand your network then you have to



83

00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:52.080

apply what they call cold applying which is basically applying through the Web site directly.



84

00:05:52.310 --> 00:05:57.470

And this is actually probably the worst pass through rate but its kind of a necessary evil you will



85

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:02.300

have to do this for certain jobs where you just have a connection and I would recommend using sites



86

00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:07.100

like indeed lengthen jobs Stack Overflow jobs and monster that etc..



87

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:10.520

Thats your typical Google search find the job apply for it.



88

00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.980

Be prepared to get a lot of rejections this way and also be prepared to receive no reply this way.



89

00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.280

Theres also interview services and these are companies that are still generally new so keep an eye out



90

00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.230

for changes.



91

00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:29.490

But these are companies where they're basically jump you straight to the technical screening and some



92

00:06:29.490 --> 00:06:31.210

sort of automated process.



93

00:06:31.350 --> 00:06:35.820

And as you can imagine a technical screening is a lot more difficult than a typical technical screening



94

00:06:36.030 --> 00:06:40.780

but once you pass it you kind of immediately jump onto the availability of an onsite.



95

00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:46.440

Some of the more popular companies in this space are triple by interviewing the ISO and indeed prime.



96

00:06:46.530 --> 00:06:48.540

Again these companies really come and go a lot.



97

00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:54.400

So you may want to do your own google search for interview service companies of this nature.



98

00:06:56.140 --> 00:07:01.510

Remember that applications are one of the most difficult steps in the entire interview process it really



99

00:07:01.510 --> 00:07:03.120

takes a toll on you.



100

00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.600

Do not get discouraged don't litter frustrate you.



101

00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:06.690

They'll hold you back.



102

00:07:06.730 --> 00:07:07.990

Everyone has to go through it.



103

00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.810

And as we just saw even great engineers people who create great products they get rejected and they



104

00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.130

still succeeded later on.



105

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.980

So again don't let this process discourage you.



106

00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:18.790

OK.



107

00:07:18.880 --> 00:07:24.100

I hope that helped in giving you an idea of how to go through the interview process for a data science



108

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:24.720

position.
