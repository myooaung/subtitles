1
00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:10,080
This interview question number six for probability theory.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,070
Let's imagine again you're given a fair coin.

3
00:00:13,130 --> 00:00:17,870
The question is on average how many flips would you need to get two heads in a row.

4
00:00:18,140 --> 00:00:21,470
This is actually really similar to the first question in this section of the course.

5
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:26,780
But now specifically only want two heads on unlike the first time we ask this question where we didn't

6
00:00:26,780 --> 00:00:32,060
care if it was two heads in a row or two tails in a row now are specifically asking on average how many

7
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:36,710
flips would you need in order to get specifically two heads in a row.

8
00:00:36,710 --> 00:00:38,600
Best of luck and I'll see at the solutions.
