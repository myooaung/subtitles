00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:11.670

Welcome to your first statistics interview question the question is that you're about to get on a plane



2

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.490

to Seattle and you want to know if you should bring an umbrella.



3

00:00:15.620 --> 00:00:21.030

You call three random friends of yours who live in Seattle and you ask each of them in the alley if



4

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.910

it's raining.



5

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.290

So going to Seattle you want to know if it's raining or not.



6

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:26.370

You call up three random friends that live there.



7

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:28.680

Ask him if it's raining or not.



8

00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:32.880

Each of your friends however has a two thirds chance of telling you the truth.



9

00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.600

And a one third chance of messing with you by lying all three of your friends tell you that yes it is



10

00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:40.900

going to be raining there.



11

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:48.500

You also know that just in general there is a 25 percent chance it's raining on any given day in Seattle.



12

00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.120

The question is based off your friends responses and what you know about their behavior as far as telling



13

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.640

the truth or lying.



14

00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.390

What is the true probability that it's actually raining in Seattle based off the information.



15

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:01.520

No.



16

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:06.740

So again just to reiterate you know that on any given day there's a 25 percent chance training in Seattle.



17

00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:12.540

When you called each year friends who are in the pen of each other they have a two thirds chance of



18

00:01:12.540 --> 00:01:13.310

telling you the truth.



19

00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:18.110

And a one third chance of messing up few by lying all three of them said that yes it's raining.



20

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.500

And remember these friends are in the pen of each other.



21

00:01:21.350 --> 00:01:21.780

OK.



22

00:01:21.920 --> 00:01:24.990

So now what is the probability that it's actually raining in Seattle.
