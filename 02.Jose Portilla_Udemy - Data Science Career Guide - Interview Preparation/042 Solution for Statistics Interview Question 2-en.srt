1
00:00:05,660 --> 00:00:10,090
Welcomes the solution for the seconds to stick's interview question.

2
00:00:10,190 --> 00:00:15,680
So this question was about that quantum messaging system and you had a probability of 0.8 success in

3
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:18,240
any attempt to send the message through and you want.

4
00:00:18,250 --> 00:00:24,200
Luckily having seven successes and 10 attempts and the hint was to look at a binomial distribution and

5
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:28,910
a binomial distribution is a very common distribution to be tested on in an interview setting.

6
00:00:28,900 --> 00:00:33,580
So you definitely want to have this formula memorized going to show later on if you're in an interview.

7
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:38,000
He should also be aware of if you're ever in a situation where the question being asked gives you a

8
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:40,330
probability of either success or failure.

9
00:00:40,460 --> 00:00:45,080
You trying to figure out something happening and a certain number of attempts the binomial distribution

10
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:48,780
is typically going to be a really good way to tackle that sort of interview question.

11
00:00:48,830 --> 00:00:53,270
So keep that in mind in case you ever hear those key words of probability of success probability of

12
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:56,490
failure or attempts OK.

13
00:00:56,490 --> 00:01:01,290
So let's briefly discover what a binomial experiment actually is.

14
00:01:01,290 --> 00:01:04,810
So by no the experiment is one that possesses the following properties.

15
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:10,690
One experiment consists of and repeated trials so that works for us because we have and repeated messages.

16
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:16,220
Number two each trial results in an outcome that may be classified as a success or failure.

17
00:01:16,230 --> 00:01:17,590
That's also true for our case.

18
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:23,160
And then 3 the probability of success denoted by P remains constant from trial to trial and repeated

19
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:24,370
trials are independent.

20
00:01:24,550 --> 00:01:30,360
That's actually noted in the phrasing of the problem if we go back here in the probability of success

21
00:01:30,360 --> 00:01:32,540
and any attempt to send the message through.

22
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:37,350
So that's basically telling you that the messages are probability of success is independent of the previous

23
00:01:37,350 --> 00:01:38,080
message.

24
00:01:39,740 --> 00:01:45,980
So the number of successes acts in end trials of a binomial experiment is called by no middle random

25
00:01:45,980 --> 00:01:46,660
variable.

26
00:01:46,730 --> 00:01:52,520
And basically what we're getting at here is this binomial probability distribution actually has an equation

27
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:56,060
that you can use for the probability of X being equal to k.

28
00:01:56,180 --> 00:01:57,680
Has that formula right there.

29
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:01,590
And that's going to be for that little and overcame princes.

30
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:03,950
That's simply just the combination formula.

31
00:02:04,150 --> 00:02:07,430
Where and is the number of things to choose from.

32
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:09,010
And you're going to choose k of them.

33
00:02:09,020 --> 00:02:10,370
So there's no repetition.

34
00:02:10,400 --> 00:02:13,800
Or does it matter for combinations and it's equal to this formula.

35
00:02:13,820 --> 00:02:20,630
Right here and factorial over K factorial times and minus k factorial and then P remember the probability

36
00:02:20,630 --> 00:02:21,420
of success.

37
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:24,150
And you can think of one minus p as a probability of failure.

38
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,860
So that means if we're playing this and the probability of success is P equal 0.8.

39
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:33,560
So that means Q which is equal to one minus three.

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,500
Q Is the probability of failure is equal to 0.2.

41
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,420
So now we're looking for the probability of that random variable x equal to 7.

42
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:46,710
So we have seven successes and that's going to be the combination ten seven times 0.8 to the power seven

43
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,830
times probability of failure 0.2.

44
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:51,410
The power of ten minus seven.

45
00:02:51,450 --> 00:02:58,140
And if you calculate that all out you get 0.01 3 3 and hopefully the interviewer doesn't actually require

46
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:00,990
you to get out a calculator and actually calculate this out.

47
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,890
They're really just looking for that second line and seeing that you understand how you can convert

48
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:08,080
that word problem to the binomial distribution.

49
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:09,000
OK.

50
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:13,570
So if you do that by no is tradition formula that should have been a very straightforward problem.

51
00:03:13,710 --> 00:03:16,630
If you need a refresher on that go ahead and check the links in the guidebook.

52
00:03:16,670 --> 00:03:18,870
There are some great resources there for you.

53
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:20,400
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
