Welcome to interview question number one for product design and metrics.



2

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:16.300

So let's go ahead and give you the following case study in 2011 Facebook launched messenger as a standalone



3

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:18.280

app for mobile devices.



4

00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:20.680

And it used to be only part of the Facebook app.



5

00:00:20.680 --> 00:00:25.450

And basically what messenger is it's the part of Facebook where you can send direct messages to other



6

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:27.470

users or other friends on Facebook.



7

00:00:27.730 --> 00:00:32.000

And in 2011 they basically launched that as a separate application.



8

00:00:32.020 --> 00:00:37.000

So the question is how would you track the performance of this new application this separate messenger



9

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.430

application that's been separated from the main Facebook app.



10

00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.900

And what kind of metrics would you use.



11

00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:43.490

All right.



12

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:44.380

Best of luck.



13

00:00:44.410 --> 00:00:47.210

Again remember there's no 100 percent correct solution to this.



14

00:00:47.230 --> 00:00:49.490

It's just the general thought process and a conversation.
