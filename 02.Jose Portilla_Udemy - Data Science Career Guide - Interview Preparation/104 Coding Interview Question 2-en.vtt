Welcome everyone to coding interview trivia question number two.



2

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.790

So for this coding answer your question you're going to need to be given a string in the form of something



3

00:00:13.790 --> 00:00:17.900

that looks like this just a bunch of A's a bunch of BS bunch of CS a bunch of these E's etc..



4

00:00:17.900 --> 00:00:23.240

So just a bunch of letters in a row together and your job is to compress it in the following format



5

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:25.130

a for be for sci fi.



6

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:26.480

The two E-4.



7

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:31.370

So what's actually happening here is you're given a string a bunch of letters are repeating and they're



8

00:00:31.370 --> 00:00:37.250

always grouped together and you can see here that you're going to compress them by just putting the



9

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:40.940

letter and then the number of times it appears straight after it.



10

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:47.940

So for this fall for this problem you can falsely compress strings of single or double letters.



11

00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:56.440

So for instance what I mean by falsely compress is that if you have a B you can return a to b 1.



12

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.820

Even though this technically is taking up more space so it's not really a compression task it's more



13

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:02.600

of just a task.



14

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:07.570

Can you count how many letters there are in the sequence and then put them into a single letter.



15

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:13.200

Attack Iran as a number are going to be dealing of strings here with addition sums et cetera.



16

00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:19.880

And keep in mind the function should also be case sensitive so that a string capitally capitally capitally



17

00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:24.760

lower case a lower case lower case a returns capitally three lower case three.



18

00:01:24.990 --> 00:01:30.380

Again basically it's more of a counting compression than just pure true compression because you could



19

00:01:30.380 --> 00:01:37.070

get results that take up more space so that's what I mean by that example of WB giving a to be one.



20

00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:37.550

All right.



21

00:01:37.640 --> 00:01:38.940

Best of luck on this problem.



22

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:42.070

If you have any questions feel free to post the Q&amp;A forums.



23

00:01:42.230 --> 00:01:43.220

I'll see at the solutions.
