00:00:05.920 --> 00:00:11.380

Welcome everyone to the solution for design of experiments question number one says review.



2

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:14.770

This is where Google wanted to add a new button to their main search page.



3

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:18.890

How can they determine whether or not people enjoy this new button feature.



4

00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:20.640

So this type of question is really common.



5

00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:25.920

It's essentially just testing to see whether or not you understand the concept of an AB test and it



6

00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:32.190

may be framed in all sorts of manners but really just how do you test a new feature to your given user



7

00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.240

base then they're just asking you CAN YOU EXPLAIN A B testing to me.



8

00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:42.450

So AB testing it's a really wide and large topic so be sure to study it well at a position posting actually



9

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:44.000

asked for it specifically.



10

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:49.950

Or if you're working or you're going to be working for a company that specializes in AB testing or implements



11

00:00:49.950 --> 00:00:56.330

a lot of features this way you can check out the guidebook for a lot of great resources on this.



12

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.390

So as I just mentioned you can check out the resources for more details.



13

00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:02.800

You should understand hypothesis testing before studying AB testing.



14

00:01:02.820 --> 00:01:08.640

It's the more traditional statistical approach AB testing is basically building off hypothesis testing



15

00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:11.190

in an actual implementation approach.



16

00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:13.410

Foolishest over a few of the main concepts here.



17

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.540

Again lots of resources for you in the guidebook.



18

00:01:17.630 --> 00:01:22.610

So we want to actually first decide on metrics to compare across the dual versions of the site we're



19

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:23.940

going to be serving.



20

00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:30.200

So there's lots of common metrics to be using daily active users monthly active users click through



21

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.580

rate impressions engagement time spent on the web site etc..



22

00:01:34.580 --> 00:01:40.810

So this is where you may want to think about what the actual situation is and then decide on some metrics



23

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:42.120

the ones we give in here.



24

00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:47.300

This can work for almost any situation but for other more specific applications you may want to figure



25

00:01:47.300 --> 00:01:50.190

out metrics that are more specific to that application.



26

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:55.880

Maybe you're testing out an email service so something more specific than daily active users to an email



27

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:02.320

service maybe something like how many emails are sent on an average day before and after the change.



28

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:04.610

So lots of metrics you can choose.



29

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:09.740

It's always good to think of these basic ones such as daily active users monthly active users engagement



30

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:15.220

through time and then also add in some specific ones for whatever the actual question is asking about



31

00:02:17.130 --> 00:02:23.170

so the second step then is to prepare two or more versions of your site or page one for each additional



32

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.180

feature or each variation of the feature you're doing.



33

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:31.210

So again one feature is going to or one version is going to be without the feature change your control



34

00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:35.200

and then another version is going to be the new feature change in this case we're just doing a classic



35

00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:38.210

AB test where there's version A and a version B.



36

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:44.610

So you're going to be serving different versions of the page to the population and you're going to need



37

00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:49.980

to randomly split up the population being careful not to introduce biases when randomly splitting.



38

00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:52.410

So that's another careful consideration to make.



39

00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:58.950

You don't want to do something like split based off Geographic reason or geographic location because



40

00:02:58.950 --> 00:03:04.630

that could actually introduce some sort of bias as far as the populations are serving your site too.



41

00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:08.720

Or you don't want to do random split based off age of users.



42

00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:12.290

You want to try to make sure that your split is as random as possible.



43

00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:19.380

That way both populations are good representation of the entire population and you test.



44

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:24.460

So once this is set up where you can do is begin to find your sophistical hypothesis test.



45

00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:27.660

So you end up creating a null hypothesis for your hypothesis testing.



46

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.190

For example the metric chosen will be the same for both groups.



47

00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:37.290

So for instance maybe you're going to say daily active users is going to be the same for people seeing



48

00:03:37.290 --> 00:03:43.430

the new feature for people seeing the original web site page for the hypothesis test.



49

00:03:43.430 --> 00:03:46.140

You will pre-define your bold type 1 error.



50

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:51.050

So this is known as false positive rate or sometimes also known as alpha depending on how you frame



51

00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:57.700

this and using this you can use the p value of your test decide whether or not the results are significant.



52

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:02.640

You're also going to want to assess the power of these testicle test.



53

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.400

So this is known as one minus beta.



54

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:08.550

Mathematically where beta is just the type 2 error member that's the false negative rate.



55

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.400

And those are the basics behind the AB test.



56

00:04:11.410 --> 00:04:17.080

Remember that you can't look up hypothesis testing in general to get a better understanding of the statistical



57

00:04:17.080 --> 00:04:18.800

background behind the sort of testing.



58

00:04:18.820 --> 00:04:26.140

But basic idea behind the sort of questions is can the candidate explain AB test thoroughly enough to



59

00:04:26.140 --> 00:04:27.230

the interviewer.



60

00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:32.530

Now in practice you're also going to want to consider factors such as how long to run the experiment



61

00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:37.660

and you can use confidence intervals to actually do this mathematically and you're also going to need



62

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:41.760

to decide on a protocol for outliers so how do you actually deal with outliers.



63

00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.410

Are you just going to ignore them because they're not a big deal.



64

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:49.150

Given the size of your population or are you going to cut them off using maybe a box plot method or



65

00:04:49.150 --> 00:04:50.710

some sort of truncation method.



66

00:04:50.710 --> 00:04:51.040

All right.



67

00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:54.040

So that's the basic idea behind AB testing in general.



68

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.060

Definitely check out the resources in the guidebook.



69

00:04:56.080 --> 00:05:01.600

If you think the job posting is going to dive really deep into AB testing for some certain data science



70

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:04.120

positions it's a big part of your day to day work.



71

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.830

So having a really good understanding of AB testing and hypothesis testing in general is always a great



72

00:05:08.830 --> 00:05:09.820

idea.



73

00:05:09.860 --> 00:05:11.980

Okay thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
