00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.600

As you learn more about a possible career in data science one thing is going to become really clear



2

00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:16.280

and that's that data science is interdisciplinary.



3

00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.520

So what does that actually mean.



4

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.650

Well it means there's many skills or disciplines that you're going to need in order to continue a career



5

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:24.510

path down data science.



6

00:00:24.510 --> 00:00:26.090

Now there's three main skill sets.



7

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.520

One is computer science.



8

00:00:27.540 --> 00:00:29.700

The other one is Mathis's mystics.



9

00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:36.000

And then finally domain knowledge and the intersection of all three of these is where data science really



10

00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.180

begins to shine.



11

00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:43.370

Now computer sciences are things like coding or data structures and algorithms math and still sticks



12

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:47.430

that's just basics sticks and probability theory and then domain knowledge.



13

00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.730

That's actually your expertise in whatever field you're working in.



14

00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:56.130

So if you're a data scientist that Facebook your domain knowledge may be things like understanding social



15

00:00:56.130 --> 00:01:03.060

networks if youre a data scientist in some sort of candy bar or a factory that's going to be understanding



16

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:06.840

the different aspects of what makes a candy bar those kind of things.



17

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:10.810

And you can see these different intersections that kind of expand beyond data scientists.



18

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.570

So typically if you're just a computer scientist working in a specific domain that makes you a software



19

00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:20.790

engineer if you're more focused on the intersection of math and computer science without really caring



20

00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:26.520

about a specific domain then that's more of just pure machine learning and then applying math to sticks



21

00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:28.210

to domain's themselves.



22

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:33.150

That's just usually traditional research applies to to test two different data from a domain and the



23

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.110

intersection of all these ideas is really data science itself.



24

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.080

Now keep in mind this is a lot to learn.



25

00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:46.810

And employers are really looking for what they call T-shaped candidates and it T-shaped candidate is



26

00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.220

called that way because you'll have general knowledge about a lot of these topics.



27

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:55.270

Computer Science domain knowledge math statistics probability.



28

00:01:55.570 --> 00:02:00.900

And then you'll hopefully have some sort of expertise in a specific domain.



29

00:02:00.910 --> 00:02:07.710

Maybe you're one of the best at a particular library in Python or you're very good at data visualization.



30

00:02:07.750 --> 00:02:10.150

So that's what a ship can looks like.



31

00:02:10.150 --> 00:02:15.970

You have general knowledge of a lot of topics and then you have a key expertise that you can leverage



32

00:02:16.030 --> 00:02:19.520

for the potential employer.



33

00:02:19.710 --> 00:02:23.790

So again candidates who have a general standing of lots of topics and a deep expertise in one or a few



34

00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.500

topics are known as T shirt candidates and those are highly desirable candidates in the data science



35

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:29.420

field.



36

00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:33.680

So let's go ahead and move on by discussing data science positions and titles.
