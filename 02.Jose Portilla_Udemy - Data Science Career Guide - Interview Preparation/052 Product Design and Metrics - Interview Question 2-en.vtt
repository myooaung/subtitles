00:00:05.540 --> 00:00:10.130

Welcome to your second interview question for product design and metrics.



2

00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:14.750

So for the next few questions we're going to be discussing different aspects of the same scenario.



3

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:17.100

So let's go ahead and describe the situation.



4

00:00:18.250 --> 00:00:19.670

So here's the situation.



5

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:22.750

Google has released a new version of their search algorithm.



6

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:28.120

So when you go to their home page you type in a word to search and Google just released the new version



7

00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:31.570

of it and they're going to do some AB testing on this.



8

00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.000

Now they're in the testing process.



9

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:38.630

What the engineers realized is that the new algorithm wasn't actually implemented correctly and return



10

00:00:38.630 --> 00:00:40.350

the less relevant results.



11

00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:44.230

So two things happened during this testing.



12

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:47.820

People in the treatment group performed more queries in the control group.



13

00:00:47.950 --> 00:00:52.900

That is the treatment group got that new version of the algorithm that had less relevant results and



14

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:56.350

they were actually performing more queries than the control group.



15

00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:01.400

The other thing that happened was that advertising revenue was higher in the treatment group as well.



16

00:01:01.420 --> 00:01:07.390

So that means two things that are occurring here is that people who are receiving the search results



17

00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:12.960

of this less relevant new algorithm the one that had the mistaken it they are performing more queries.



18

00:01:13.030 --> 00:01:17.500

And there's also more advertising revenue to the treatment group versus the control group which was



19

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.660

receiving the base and correct algorithm.



20

00:01:21.860 --> 00:01:24.170

So the first question for the situation is the following.



21

00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.770

What may be the cause of people in the treatment group performing more searches than the control group



22

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:31.580

OK.



23

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:35.800

We'll go ahead and discuss possible ways of answering the question in the next solution lecture.
