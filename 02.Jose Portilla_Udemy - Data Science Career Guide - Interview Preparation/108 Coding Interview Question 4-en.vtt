Welcome everyone to coding Interview Question Number.



2

00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:14.170

So for this question you're going to need to consider an array of non-negative integers and then a second



3

00:00:14.230 --> 00:00:19.920

array is formed by shuffling the elements of the first array and deleting a random element.



4

00:00:20.230 --> 00:00:25.230

So given these two arrays you need to find which element is missing in the second array.



5

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:32.520

So for example let's say you're given the arrays one two three four five and the other array happens



6

00:00:32.520 --> 00:00:38.790

to be 1 3 4 5 and you can see that the missing value was 2 and sometimes the arrays are also going to



7

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.820

be shuffled so keep that in mind as well.



8

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:42.930

And you could try to solve this problem multiple ways.



9

00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:45.230

There's lots of different approaches you can take to this.



10

00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:49.110

There's actually a really simple clever approach you can take and maybe you've already discovered it



11

00:00:49.110 --> 00:00:50.330

just by looking at this problem.



12

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:54.960

Thinking about it but try to solve it in multiple ways because sometimes your interview is going to



13

00:00:55.260 --> 00:00:58.550

ask you to solve the same question different ways over and over again.



14

00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.880

So maybe they only come in a fun question but expect like three different solutions for it.



15

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:03.660

All right.



16

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.010

Hope you have fun with this exercise.



17

00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:06.120

I'll see at the solutions.
