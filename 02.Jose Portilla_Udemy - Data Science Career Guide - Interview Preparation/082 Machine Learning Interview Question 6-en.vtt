Well to machine learning Interview Question Number Six So here the question is if you're given a data



2

00:00:11.540 --> 00:00:16.910

set of features which will call X and corresponding labels for will call y.



3

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:21.240

What assumptions are made when using the naive Beys methods.



4

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:26.890

So basically the reason we say that a set of features X enables y is in case you want to describe the



5

00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:32.260

such assumptions in terms of the features and labels you can use the x and y terms to help explain your



6

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.400

understanding.



7

00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:38.680

So again just a basic question is What are the assumptions made when using naive Bates methods.
