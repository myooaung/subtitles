Welcome to interview question number one for design of experiments.

2
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:11,870
So here's the situation.

3
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:15,370
Google wants to add a new button to their main search page.

4
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,260
What's a way that they can determine whether or not people actually enjoy this new button feature.

5
00:00:20,510 --> 00:00:26,150
So try to elaborate as best you can of the different processes they could use to determine whether or

6
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:29,960
not people are enjoying this new feature on their search page.

7
00:00:29,960 --> 00:00:30,650
All right.

8
00:00:30,890 --> 00:00:35,530
I'll see you at the next lecture where we walk through and talk through an example solution.
