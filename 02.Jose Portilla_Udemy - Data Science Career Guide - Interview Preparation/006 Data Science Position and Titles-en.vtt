00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.600

By now you may have realized that the position title of data scientist is not the only title that pertains



2

00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:17.780

to data science ideas such as probability coding machine learning cetera.



3

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:23.310

Let's go ahead and go over at different positions and titles and what employers in general expect from



4

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.880

someone applying to that particular position.



5

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:32.430

So as I mentioned that data scientist is not the only job title that companies use and lots of companies



6

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:38.710

use different titles for different focuses for roles in the field of science and I should be clear here



7

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:41.860

at the companies also use the same term differently.



8

00:00:41.860 --> 00:00:47.980

So a data scientist at a small company may be called a data analyst at a larger company like Google.



9

00:00:47.980 --> 00:00:52.330

So we're going to go over a few titles under general descriptions and things that tend to differentiate



10

00:00:52.330 --> 00:00:53.110

these titles.



11

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.240

Again each company may be a different situation.



12

00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:03.450

So first off we have someone that's maybe called a product analyst or sometimes a product data scientist



13

00:01:03.990 --> 00:01:10.620

and this is a person who analyzes user data to create reports that generally go to their product managers



14

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:11.540

directly.



15

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:17.190

And typically they're using coding as their main tool but sometimes certain companies may prefer a pre-defined



16

00:01:17.190 --> 00:01:21.950

software tool something like Tablo for instance.



17

00:01:22.070 --> 00:01:26.870

Then there's the business analyst or someone who works in Business Intelligence and that's attempting



18

00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:30.620

to create insights and analysis from business data.



19

00:01:30.620 --> 00:01:32.310

So this may also be user data.



20

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:38.050

But specifically this data pertains to whatever the main business of this company is.



21

00:01:38.090 --> 00:01:44.030

And often a business analyst or business intelligence engineer is going to focus on using a specific



22

00:01:44.030 --> 00:01:48.360

tool such as Tablo or Excel or maybe using some internal tool.



23

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:53.570

And in fact if you're a business intelligence engineer your job may be to actually help develop an internal



24

00:01:53.570 --> 00:01:59.390

tool that mimics some of the features of Tablo or Excel but is more specifically designed towards whatever



25

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:03.770

this particular company's business data is.



26

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:06.500

Then you have the title of machine learning engineer.



27

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:12.180

Now machine learning engineer this tends to be a very technical role both in theoretical knowledge and



28

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:14.360

really good coding skills are necessary.



29

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.470

And in general the machine learning engineer is going to create custom machine learning algorithm models



30

00:02:19.470 --> 00:02:20.410

for the team.



31

00:02:20.550 --> 00:02:26.220

So they're not just going to do simple imports from some sort of pre-determine library like sikat learn



32

00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:28.670

or some of the models that already exist are.



33

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:33.360

If you're being hired on as a machine learning engineer it's likely that you're going to have to develop



34

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:37.910

some sort of custom machine learning algorithm model and it's going to be based on the fundamentals



35

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:43.350

things like rain forest or me regression models etc. but you're going to have to customize them to this



36

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:44.800

particular company's needs.



37

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:49.680

So again this is usually a very technical role and a lot of times companies are going to the man some



38

00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:52.940

sort of higher education to reflect that technical ability.



39

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:56.570

Not always but it is pretty common.



40

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:01.960

Then you have a data engineer role which differs from the machine learning engineer now a Data Engineer.



41

00:03:02.020 --> 00:03:07.990

It's again a technical role but it's actually focused more on coding and tools and not so much on theory



42

00:03:08.380 --> 00:03:09.150

and the Data Engineer.



43

00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:14.800

Typically a company is going to be building pipelines that connect the actual data warehouse to data



44

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.200

analysis or machine learning systems.



45

00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.090

So a lot of times you can think of the Data Engineer as the person that's building the systems that



46

00:03:22.090 --> 00:03:28.400

connect the actual data warehouse to the team that's going to analyze the data scientists themselves.



47

00:03:28.460 --> 00:03:33.920

Then you have this classic data scientist role and title and this generally requires a mix of coding



48

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.100

and theory skills and often companies are going to post a more detailed use case on the actual job posting.



49

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.510

So overall for many of these positions focus less on the actual title and focus more on the qualifying



50

00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:49.580

skills of the job posting itself.



51

00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:55.490

So you can use sites like Glassdoor dot com to find out more information about company job titles and



52

00:03:55.490 --> 00:03:59.990

what that job title actually relates to as far as day to day tasks are concerned.



53

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:01.230

At that company.



54

00:04:01.250 --> 00:04:03.140

Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
