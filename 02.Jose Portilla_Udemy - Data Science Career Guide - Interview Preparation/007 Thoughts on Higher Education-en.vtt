00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:06.500

Welcome back everyone.



2

00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:12.230

Before we end this section I just want to give some thoughts on higher education things like a graduate



3

00:00:12.230 --> 00:00:19.700

degree has such as a masters or a Ph.D. and how that may help in your job search and what that really



4

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:23.340

means for your job search as a data scientist.



5

00:00:23.510 --> 00:00:26.120

So it's a really common question that I get from students a lot.



6

00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:32.440

Do I need to get a master's or a Ph.D. to pursue data science and a lot of what is about to follow.



7

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:36.290

It's really just my personal opinions then you're going to need to take the time to reflect on your



8

00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.980

specific situation and maybe the specific company that you're applying to.



9

00:00:40.010 --> 00:00:44.730

So take that into consideration as you listen to what I had to say.



10

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:51.010

In my personal opinion it's going to be harder to get a job in a position where formal requirements



11

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:55.370

like machine learning engineer without an advanced degree in a larger company.



12

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.000

And often recruiters that these larger companies like Facebook or Google they're going to be given requirements



13

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:06.370

for candidates to actually have either a master's or a Ph.D. and there's not going to be really allowed



14

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:09.590

to consider you if you don't have those graduate degrees.



15

00:01:09.670 --> 00:01:14.230

Unless you've done something absolutely phenomenal like you created your own deep learning library that



16

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.460

has a lot of users.



17

00:01:17.530 --> 00:01:24.280

Now if you plan to go more of an entrepreneur route such as freelancing graduate degrees become less



18

00:01:24.280 --> 00:01:25.010

important.



19

00:01:25.180 --> 00:01:30.420

At that point it really matters what you've done and your portfolio of projects they can show for it.



20

00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:35.020

So no one's really going to care if you have a Ph.D. if you're just freelancing and you've already have



21

00:01:35.020 --> 00:01:41.040

a portfolio of satisfied customers and different projects you can show off.



22

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.070

Now keep in mind each individual situation is different.



23

00:01:44.070 --> 00:01:49.230

Many entrepreneurs come from graduate degree backgrounds and some employees at large companies that



24

00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:54.900

do work has machine learning engineers for example don't actually have graduate degrees so it's a spectrum.



25

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.850

There's definitely different cases for each situation.



26

00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:04.140

So I want to take a look at just two extremes on the spectrum of higher education so you can get an



27

00:02:04.140 --> 00:02:08.250

idea of what's actually in the real world out there.



28

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:12.300

Now keep in mind most people are going to be somewhere in between these two real life examples.



29

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:15.440

I'm going to give examples of two people kind of with the extremes of the spectrum.



30

00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:17.990

But again most people are going to be somewhere in between.



31

00:02:19.370 --> 00:02:19.580

OK.



32

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.030

So let's first look at Ian Goodfellow.



33

00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:25.680

I would say he's on the extreme spectrum of getting higher education.



34

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:30.400

So he has a bachelor's and master's in computer science from Stanford University and then continued



35

00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:33.340

on to get a Ph.D. in machine learning.



36

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:39.220

He's a co-author on a book on deep learning and more importantly he's one of the creators of generative



37

00:02:39.310 --> 00:02:46.480

adversarial networks which is a very popular and very trending type of neural network in the deep learning



38

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.800

space that allows you to basically generate examples of data now.



39

00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:56.050

Ian Goodfellow here he used to work at Google.



40

00:02:56.050 --> 00:03:00.160

Then he moved on to open AI and I believe now he's actually back at Google.



41

00:03:00.290 --> 00:03:05.080

As you can imagine someone of his skill set and his technical knowledge isn't really high demand so



42

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.490

by the time you listen to this maybe he works somewhere else but this will be an example of someone



43

00:03:09.490 --> 00:03:14.090

who's gone the graduate degree route and it's worked out very well for him.



44

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.910

And there are also a lot of opportunities to work with a lot of other talented people in some of the



45

00:03:18.910 --> 00:03:23.850

labs he was working in as well as getting an opportunity to co-author a book on deep learning.



46

00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:28.780

So that's one end of the spectrum of how pursuing a graduate degree can really help you on your path



47

00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:34.280

to becoming a data scientist or in this case an expert in machine learning bullets go ahead and take



48

00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:38.870

a look at someone on the opposite side of the spectrum and that would be Adam Gibson who is actually



49

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:45.230

a college dropout and yet he's the creator of a library called Deep learning for Jane which is a deep



50

00:03:45.230 --> 00:03:47.110

learning library for Java.



51

00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:51.700

He's also the co-founder of a Y Combinator backed company called Sky mind.



52

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:54.630

So this is someone without any sort of graduate degree.



53

00:03:54.650 --> 00:04:00.560

In fact total college dropout I believe he only did his first two years in undergrad.



54

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:07.280

So again other ops and the spectrum and he took a much more entrepreneur type route where he's actually



55

00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.270

creating his own libraries has a good portfolio and is actually able to start his own company.



56

00:04:12.290 --> 00:04:16.000

Now I should mention he dropped out of college to start his company.



57

00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:20.210

That doesn't mean I'm giving the advice of everyone dropped out of college and start you know a machine



58

00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:21.230

learning company.



59

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:27.470

But keep in mind it is definitely possible to become a you know renowned data scientist or entrepreneur



60

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:30.740

without the background of graduate degrees.



61

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.410

So again two ends of the spectrum here.



62

00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.560

Most people are not going to be one of these extremes are going to be somewhere in the middle.



63

00:04:37.610 --> 00:04:43.650

So I just want to get to real life examples of people who have done it one way or the other.



64

00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:48.900

So make sure you understand that the topics involved data science are complex and they're not easy to



65

00:04:48.900 --> 00:04:49.450

learn.



66

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:53.260

There's really no wrong or right path to becoming a data scientist.



67

00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:56.560

And you should really create your own path on your career journey.



68

00:04:56.970 --> 00:04:57.690

OK.



69

00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.550

Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
