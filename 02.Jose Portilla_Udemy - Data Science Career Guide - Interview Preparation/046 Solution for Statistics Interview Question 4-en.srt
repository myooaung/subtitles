00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:12,460
Welcome everyone to the solution for Interview Question number four in the statistics section of course.

2
00:00:12,470 --> 00:00:17,570
So again for this question you have this new medical test and this is a really common type of interview

3
00:00:17,570 --> 00:00:23,210
question especially to test your understanding of statistics and things like accuracy precision and

4
00:00:23,210 --> 00:00:28,370
recall and how to judge a experiment or the results of an experiment correctly.

5
00:00:28,460 --> 00:00:34,810
So you'll often see if is a medical test but be aware there's other kinds of ways to frame this question.

6
00:00:34,930 --> 00:00:37,360
At the end of the day you're trying to figure out some probability.

7
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:41,980
In our case we were trying to figure out the probability if a patient had tested positive that they

8
00:00:41,980 --> 00:00:43,190
actually have the virus.

9
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:47,550
So just yet another question or we can use Bayes Rule.

10
00:00:47,650 --> 00:00:52,960
Again very popular interview questions so let's walk through the steps how we would do this actual question.

11
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,520
So we know the probability of being sick in the population is 0.01.

12
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:04,120
And we also know that 99 percent of sick patients test positive meaning the probability of testing positive

13
00:01:04,150 --> 00:01:08,620
given that you're sick is going to be equal to zero point ninety nine.

14
00:01:08,620 --> 00:01:12,190
We also know that ninety nine percent of healthy patients test negative.

15
00:01:12,190 --> 00:01:14,840
So the probability of testing negative.

16
00:01:14,890 --> 00:01:17,950
If you're not sick it's going to be point nine as well.

17
00:01:18,160 --> 00:01:21,350
But we want to solve for is the probability of being sick.

18
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:28,340
Given that you tested positive so using Bayes rule we can frame this in the following manner.

19
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:33,990
The probability of being sick given that you tested positive is equal to the probability of being sick

20
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:37,980
multiplied by the probability of testing positive.

21
00:01:37,980 --> 00:01:43,600
Given that you were sick divided by the probability of testing positive.

22
00:01:43,660 --> 00:01:48,400
Now we can actually calculate some of these things that we need particularly the probability of testing

23
00:01:48,400 --> 00:01:49,220
positive.

24
00:01:49,480 --> 00:01:55,030
We know the probability of testing positive is going to be the same as will say of testing positive

25
00:01:55,100 --> 00:01:55,960
when they are sick.

26
00:01:55,970 --> 00:02:00,760
Multiplied by the probability that you were sick plus the probability of testing positive given that

27
00:02:00,760 --> 00:02:06,820
you were Nasik times the probability of being not sick basically adding up the populations of sick and

28
00:02:06,820 --> 00:02:09,900
not sick and that people tested positive with them.

29
00:02:09,910 --> 00:02:14,330
So if you do the math there that ends up being well to 0.01 9 8.

30
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:20,250
So if you plug that in back to the previous base rules that we had over here we already knew the probability

31
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:24,190
of being sick as well as a probability of testing positive given that you were sick.

32
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:27,290
We just figured out the probability of testing positive.

33
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:30,300
So that means we have probability of being sick.

34
00:02:30,310 --> 00:02:33,840
Given that you tested positive is equal to 0.5.

35
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:38,710
And the idea behind a lot of these questions is so that you realize that even though it seemed like

36
00:02:38,710 --> 00:02:45,250
it was 99 percent accurate we can see here that even this person who tested positive only has a half

37
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:47,250
chance of being actually sick.

38
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:48,520
OK.

39
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:51,080
Go ahead and check out the resources in the guidebook.

40
00:02:51,100 --> 00:02:53,300
There's a really common type of interview question.

41
00:02:53,380 --> 00:02:56,770
So make sure you understand really well how this is actually working.

42
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,630
Essentially just make sure you know Bayes Rule or base theorem.

43
00:02:59,650 --> 00:03:01,340
Very well thanks.

44
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:02,410
And we'll see you at the next lecture.
