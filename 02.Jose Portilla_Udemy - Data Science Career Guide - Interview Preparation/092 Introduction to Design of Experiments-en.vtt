Hello everyone and welcome to the design of experiments.



2

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:14.570

Interview Questions section of the Course the design of experiments is really related to statistics



3

00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:21.080

especially concepts like a P-value a statistical test a hypothesis test and those sort of things so



4

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:24.280

you should make sure to review those concepts before attempting these questions.



5

00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.520

Otherwise you may be pretty lost.



6

00:00:26.770 --> 00:00:31.190

OK so once you review those concepts and again you can always check the guidebook for great resources



7

00:00:31.190 --> 00:00:31.910

on that.



8

00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:33.320

Go ahead and get started.



9

00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.420

I'll see you at the first question.
