Welcome everyone to the machine learning interview questions section of the course this series of practice

2
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:15,480
questions will focus on your general knowledge of some machine learning algorithms.

3
00:00:15,520 --> 00:00:19,630
Now we're going to mainly be asking you about your understanding of different machine learning algorithms

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:22,830
a little more from a theory perspective.

5
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:26,230
Now the best way to approach these sort of questions is to white board them out.

6
00:00:26,370 --> 00:00:30,150
That is to try to explain out loud as you're also writing down some key notes.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,610
That way when you're actually in an interview setting you can talk out loud and also write on a white

8
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:35,320
board.

9
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:39,900
So use a white board or a piece of paper helping you to convey your understanding to whoever may be

10
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:40,560
listening.

11
00:00:41,790 --> 00:00:46,200
We're going to ask about the following algorithms linear regression logistic regression.

12
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,420
This is treason trees and ran the force entry methods in general as well as nave Beys support vector

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,460
machines and just general questions on model evaluation and training.

14
00:00:55,470 --> 00:00:59,370
So if you're unfamiliar if some of these topics or wants to review some of these topics go ahead and

15
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:01,890
do that first before heading out to the questions.

16
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:02,550
OK.

17
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:03,660
We'll see you at the questions.
