Hello everyone and welcome to the solution for design of experiments.

2
00:00:07,900 --> 00:00:10,010
Question number two.

3
00:00:10,140 --> 00:00:14,700
So this question was asking how can we know if a sample is biased and what different kind of biases

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:17,070
should you be aware of when using a sample.

5
00:00:17,070 --> 00:00:21,270
So let's start off with that first question how do we know if a sample is biased.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,160
Well sometimes it's just impossible to know because of the way you actually got your sample.

7
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:30,900
If someone just gave it to you and you're not having any information about the total population it's

8
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,650
just going to be impossible for you to know.

9
00:00:32,850 --> 00:00:37,650
But one way you can check if you do have some information about the population from what you've sampled

10
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,770
is for instance if you know the true mean of your population from which you sampled you can take samples

11
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,980
of your sample multiple times and check if the mean of these samples are normally distributed around

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,630
the true mean of the population.

13
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,350
And this is known as a form of bootstrapping.

14
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,000
Check out the resources for more information on bootstrapping.

15
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:01,930
But basically the idea here is you took your sample out of the total population.

16
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,100
You know the true mean of the population and which going to end up doing is constantly be taking out

17
00:01:07,170 --> 00:01:08,780
samples from your sample.

18
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,830
So basically some samples taking the mean of that plotting and then eventually after you do this many

19
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,160
times you should see a normal distribution around the true mean of your population.

20
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,640
If you do not see that then it means that you have some sort of bias so if you see that the average

21
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:29,160
sampling mean your sample is way off from the truing of your population you probably have some sort

22
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:32,430
of bias in the way you selected your sample.

23
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:33,540
So now that we know that.

24
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:37,090
Let's go ahead and take a look at different types of biases.

25
00:01:38,420 --> 00:01:40,280
So the first one is selection bias.

26
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:45,050
So this is when by some error you have excluded a specific part of the population.

27
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,420
So an example of this would be maybe you're trying to take a sample from which you're going to ascertain

28
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:54,300
the average weight of the United States population.

29
00:01:54,300 --> 00:02:00,440
However it did selection bias you decide it's only sample from one state that could lead to some errors

30
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:05,330
because you're only looking at a specific part of the population instead of the population as a whole.

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,050
So other ways this could happen is maybe only a sample of a certain age group and you're trying to do

32
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,000
average across all age groups.

33
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:15,790
For the true population lots different ways to perform a selection bias.

34
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,560
It's really one of the most common biases.

35
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:25,540
Go ahead and check out the links in the resource guide notes for more lists of selection biases.

36
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:27,030
All right now measurement bias.

37
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:31,920
This one's a little trickier but basically what happens is when the method of measurement creates observations

38
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,300
that are different than the true value that's actually coming in.

39
00:02:35,310 --> 00:02:37,350
So how can this actually happen.

40
00:02:37,350 --> 00:02:42,870
Well for example let's say you're sampling from a stream of information and your sampling rate is lower

41
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:44,950
than the rate of change in the stream.

42
00:02:44,970 --> 00:02:47,720
So you have some sort of device and you're taking information from it.

43
00:02:47,750 --> 00:02:48,750
It's streaming.

44
00:02:48,750 --> 00:02:56,460
And let's say every half second it jumps up to some high value and then after that half second it jumps

45
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,380
down to the average value.

46
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,290
So basically has this frequency jumping up and down jamming up tumbling down every half second.

47
00:03:03,480 --> 00:03:08,860
But for some reason your sampling rate may be lower so you're maybe you're taking a sample every second.

48
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:15,060
So you're sampling at a lower frequency you're never going to see those high peaks which means you have

49
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:21,780
a measurement bias because your actual measurement is not what's true to the actual stream of information.

50
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:27,090
So this doesn't always occur but it's definitely one to be aware of.

51
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,720
So those are the two main types of biases we're going to cover in this lecture.

52
00:03:30,730 --> 00:03:35,110
But definitely check out the guidebook resources for a great breakdown of the many other types of biases

53
00:03:35,110 --> 00:03:36,670
that occur in experiments.

54
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:39,370
Selection bias is a really large umbrella term.

55
00:03:39,370 --> 00:03:41,500
There's many different types of selection bias.

56
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:45,460
So there's a link in the guidebook there for you so you can check out the different ways selection bias

57
00:03:45,460 --> 00:03:46,190
can occur.

58
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:50,480
There's really too many of them for us to just list them off here instead of the resource in the guide

59
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:50,810
book.

60
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:51,970
It's very helpful.

61
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:53,780
Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
