Welcome back for the solution for machine learning question number nine.

2
00:00:08,990 --> 00:00:14,190
So this question I was just asking you to describe the differences between accuracy precision and recall.

3
00:00:14,290 --> 00:00:18,550
So let's go ahead and imagine the results of a model where we have an actual class and then the class

4
00:00:18,940 --> 00:00:24,520
that our model predicted and we'll end up getting some true positives some true negatives false positives

5
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:25,570
and false negatives.

6
00:00:25,660 --> 00:00:29,800
And also keep in mind sometimes these columns are switched so the diagonals go the other way.

7
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,510
For what we're explaining here it's not really important so let's start off with the most common metric

8
00:00:35,510 --> 00:00:38,900
which is accuracy for classification and accuracy.

9
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:40,870
Intuitively it's really simple to understand.

10
00:00:40,910 --> 00:00:47,000
It's just simply a ratio of correctly predicted observations to the total number of observations.

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:52,310
Accuracy is a useful measure but really only when you have a symmetric dataset where values a false

12
00:00:52,310 --> 00:00:54,960
positive and false negatives are almost the same.

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,320
That doesn't always happen so therefore he should also be considering precision and recall to more formally

14
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:02,060
describe what accuracy is.

15
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,850
It's the sum of the number of true positives and number of true negatives divided by the total number

16
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,860
of observations so that will be true positives false positives false negatives and true negatives.

17
00:01:12,860 --> 00:01:19,630
So again how many did you get right out of everything precision is the ratio of correctly predicted

18
00:01:19,750 --> 00:01:21,370
positive observations.

19
00:01:21,370 --> 00:01:26,110
So the total predictive of positive observations and the question that this metric is trying to answer

20
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:29,380
is Of all the points that labeled as positive.

21
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:31,310
How many were actually positive.

22
00:01:31,390 --> 00:01:37,090
That's precision and formely can describe that as the number of true positives divided by the number

23
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,830
of true positives plus the number of false positives.

24
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,130
Then finally we have recall which is also sometimes known as sensitivity and it's the ratio of correctly

25
00:01:46,130 --> 00:01:51,020
predicted positive observations to all the observations in the actual class.

26
00:01:51,020 --> 00:01:56,390
So that's going to be equal to formally speaking true positives divided by true positives plus false

27
00:01:56,420 --> 00:01:57,620
negatives.

28
00:01:57,620 --> 00:01:57,990
All right.

29
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:03,560
So those are the basics behind accuracy precision and recall it's a really good idea for you to practice

30
00:02:03,560 --> 00:02:09,060
drawing this diagram and practice the actual formulas and explanations for accuracy precision recall.

31
00:02:09,140 --> 00:02:13,730
Those are really common metrics especially in binary classification situations and you should understand

32
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:14,320
them well.

33
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,280
And what each of them is trying to answer.

34
00:02:17,300 --> 00:02:18,890
Thanks and I'll see at the next lecture.
