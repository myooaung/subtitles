Welcome to solution for the first sequel interview question.



2

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:12.130

So again we wanted to know what was wrong with this query.



3

00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:15.260

If we take a look at it it looks like we are saying select ID.



4

00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:20.810

So that's a column we're also griping the year from the trial date column saying as Trial year.



5

00:00:20.830 --> 00:00:26.290

Note that I'm assigning an alias to the year of the trial date column than from payments.



6

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.930

And this is where the mistake happens.



7

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:32.500

I'm saying where a trial a year is less than or equal to 2015.



8

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:39.520

So the problem here is that trial year that alias is not actually going to be assigned until the end.



9

00:00:39.610 --> 00:00:45.130

So you won't be able to use it as a filter on where instead you should be using on that where filter



10

00:00:45.430 --> 00:00:47.160

something in the terms of where.



11

00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:50.230

Year of trial day is less than or equal to 2015.



12

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:55.990

So a really common stake for beginners of Eskew our sequel is that they end up trying to use the aliases



13

00:00:55.990 --> 00:01:02.350

they assign in other filters or lines of code such as the WHERE statement or group by statements.



14

00:01:02.350 --> 00:01:03.940

Again you usually can't do that.



15

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:09.060

You need to actually put in the function and the column you're applying it to.



16

00:01:09.070 --> 00:01:09.570

All right.



17

00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:10.630

I'll see you at the next lecture.
