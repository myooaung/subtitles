00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.430

Welcome to the solution for the first machine learning question.



2

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.650

So we basically just wanted to discuss linear regression for this question.



3

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:18.670

What are the main assumptions and what are the most common types of linear regression so linear regression



4

00:00:18.670 --> 00:00:24.210

models the relationship between the dependent variable Y and the independent variable x.



5

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:27.670

So we can see here basically trying to use the features of x.



6

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.680

That's the independent variable.



7

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:33.420

And then see if there's a relationship between it with the dependent variable y.



8

00:00:33.430 --> 00:00:39.440

So why is dependent on x so some of the two main assumptions here are going to be that the relationship



9

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:45.080

between the dependent variable Y and the explanatory variable x is linear to some degree because of



10

00:00:45.080 --> 00:00:49.030

it's not linear a linear regression really is not going to be helpful.



11

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:53.950

The other main assumption is that the residual errors from the regression are normally distributed.



12

00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:01.040

And remember the residual error is the difference between the y value your regression line is predicting



13

00:01:01.190 --> 00:01:06.140

versus the true y value for whatever the explanatory variable value X was.



14

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:07.650

So that's the residual error.



15

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:09.830

And they should all be normally distributed.



16

00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:15.900

Now as far as the second part of that question which was the most common types of linear regression.



17

00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.010

This is basically just asking what kind of estimation the linear regression types are there.



18

00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.650

And there's lots of types but you should know about ordinary least squares generalized least squares.



19

00:01:25.650 --> 00:01:31.260

And then in a communist interview saying to be asked about the penalize versions basically the ones



20

00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:36.450

that use regularisation to some degree and that's L1 and L2 regularisation and those are also known



21

00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.440

as Lasser aggression and rage regression.



22

00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:44.190

So make sure you understand those concepts those topics and you can check out the guidebook for a lot



23

00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:47.490

of great resources on diving deeper into linear regression.



24

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:48.150

OK.



25

00:01:48.180 --> 00:01:50.080

I hope that quick overview is helpful.



26

00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:51.190

I'll see at the next lecture.
