00:00:06.050 --> 00:00:11.390

Welcome everyone to the solution for machine learning question number five So here the question is what



2

00:00:11.390 --> 00:00:15.510

is the difference between a random forest versus a boosting tree algorithm.



3

00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:19.410

So let's go ahead and discuss boosting trees.



4

00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:26.400

So what boosting trees ended up doing is they reassign weights to samples based on the results of previous



5

00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:28.550

iterations of classifications.



6

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:35.170

So what happens is you run your boosted tree one time and then the points that were hard to classify



7

00:00:35.310 --> 00:00:41.340

you end up giving those some sort of assign a weight that give them a heavier weight and then you reiterate



8

00:00:41.460 --> 00:00:45.960

and run it again with the heavier weights assigned to those harder to classify points.



9

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:48.600

So it's an iterative process.



10

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:55.120

So again iterative algorithm where each execution is going to be based on the previous results this



11

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.460

is actually quite different than a random force.



12

00:00:57.460 --> 00:01:02.600

Remember that a random force applies bootstrap aggregation to train many different trees.



13

00:01:02.620 --> 00:01:06.070

So this creates an ensemble of different individual decision trees.



14

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.980

In random forest algorithm instead of using information gain or gynie index for calculating the root



15

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:12.510

node.



16

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:16.780

What happens is the process of finding the root node and splitting the feature nodes will happen at



17

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:17.350

random.



18

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.390

So that's where it gets its name for us because we have many decision trees and then ran them because



19

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:25.450

these split points are actually being chosen randomly.



20

00:01:25.450 --> 00:01:31.120

So those are the main differences between using a boosting tree algorithm versus a random forest algorithm.



21

00:01:31.120 --> 00:01:35.230

If you want more information on those algorithms go ahead and check out the resources in the guidebook.



22

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:37.060

Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
