Hello everyone and welcome to coding a trivia question number three.



2

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:14.350

So for this question and this is a very popular question for whatever reason and coding interviews is



3

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:18.070

that you're given an array of historical stock prices per day.



4

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:24.280

So for example simple release prices number or prices dollar six dollars on the first thing.



5

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.420

Secondly is $13 third dates $2 $10 $3 $5 et cetera.



6

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:36.490

Your job is to write an algorithm or a program that figures out what days that is the index of the survey.



7

00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:41.280

You could buy and sell the stock for maximum profit.



8

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.860

Now you're only allowed to buy the stock once and sell at once.



9

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:46.640

And then also you can't short the stock.



10

00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:50.680

That is you always have to buy the stock before selling the stock.



11

00:00:50.690 --> 00:00:55.220

So let's walk through an example of this with the example array of stock prices we just posted earlier



12

00:00:56.230 --> 00:01:01.770

silts take a look at that array of prices go 6:13 to 23:5.



13

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.800

So what was your algorithm actually do.



14

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.760

Well it's going to go along this array of stock prices and it's going to figure out that if you can



15

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.690

only buy once and sell once then you can make the most profit by buying on day three at a price of $2



16

00:01:16.020 --> 00:01:20.870

and then selling on day four at a price of $10 and getting you an eight dollar gain.



17

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:26.900

There's no other larger profit to be made regardless of what you buy and what you sell on.



18

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:32.240

Now here's a hint you should actually be able to solve this problem by only going through the array



19

00:01:32.330 --> 00:01:33.620

once.



20

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:39.500

It's easy to do it naively by basically just checking every possible combination of selling and buying



21

00:01:39.530 --> 00:01:44.210

but you should be able to do it just by going for the beginning the re checking all the numbers down



22

00:01:44.210 --> 00:01:47.380

to the end of the array and doing some sort of clever programming.



23

00:01:47.810 --> 00:01:50.360

OK thanks everyone and I'll see you at the solutions lecture.
