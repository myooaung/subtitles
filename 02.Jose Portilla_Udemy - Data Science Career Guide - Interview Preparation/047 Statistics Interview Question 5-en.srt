00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:10,230
Welcome to question of five for the statistics interview section.

2
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:12,270
So this question is the following.

3
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,910
The average life of a certain type of motor is 10 years with a standard deviation of two years.

4
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,650
If the manufacturer of the motor is willing to replace only 3 percent of the motors because of failures

5
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,230
how long of a guarantee should she offer the manufacturer.

6
00:00:31,230 --> 00:00:33,100
So again you have a motor.

7
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:39,450
It's average lifespan is 10 years and has a standard deviation of two years and the manufacturer is

8
00:00:39,450 --> 00:00:43,540
only willing to replace 3 percent of the motors because of failures.

9
00:00:43,590 --> 00:00:49,910
So the question is how many years of a guarantee should they offer so you can assume that the lives

10
00:00:49,910 --> 00:00:53,200
of the motors follow a normal distribution.

11
00:00:53,480 --> 00:00:59,120
And as a quick note to fully solve this question you will need to do some sort of look up in a value

12
00:00:59,150 --> 00:01:00,170
of a z table.

13
00:01:00,170 --> 00:01:04,490
So if you're not familiar of Z tables You may also want to do a refresher on that because you need to

14
00:01:04,490 --> 00:01:07,820
do certain things like Look some stuff up in the z table.

15
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:10,390
I want you to treat this as part of a take home task.

16
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:13,040
So feel free to use any resources you want.

17
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,830
Go ahead and look up normal distributions on the internet look up how to look up stuff in Z tables etc.

18
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:23,330
so you will need to do a little bit of that sort of analysis for this question.

19
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:26,680
It's unlikely that you're going be able to just do it all in your head or on a piece of paper.

20
00:01:26,690 --> 00:01:29,140
You will need to do some references.

21
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:31,560
So again treat this more as a take on task.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:35,990
This one's pretty tricky so we'll explain it a little more fully in the solutions.

23
00:01:35,990 --> 00:01:36,780
Best of luck.
