Welcome everyone to the solution for skill in trivia question number four.



2

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:15.210

So here we had to consider the two tables below the Employees table in the manager's table and we wanted



3

00:00:15.210 --> 00:00:19.320

to write a query that retrieves all employees managed by Sandy Kim.



4

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.410

So what's the connection here.



5

00:00:20.430 --> 00:00:24.810

Well we can see that we have the employees managed by column and there's the number three there that



6

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.640

connects to the manager's ID column where Sannie Kim has the idea three.



7

00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:37.260

So if you knew that already you could just do a simple query in this fashion you could say select name



8

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.910

from employees where it managed by equals three.



9

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:46.830

Basically that is if you already knew the knowledge that Sandy Kym's ID in the employees column was



10

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:47.880

three.



11

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:51.840

Typically however you're not going to be able to know that because there's going to be so many IDs so



12

00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:54.590

many managers that you will have to join them somehow.



13

00:00:54.720 --> 00:01:01.170

So if you came up with this query first hopefully you're able to expand it to a query that uses joins.



14

00:01:01.170 --> 00:01:02.840

So let's go ahead and go to that query now.



15

00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:05.680

So what do we do here.



16

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.780

Well we're going to say select the employees names that's the name column from the Employees table.



17

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.950

And we want to say employees dot name because there's a name column in both tables so we need to specify



18

00:01:16.220 --> 00:01:18.370

what Name column we're actually referring to.



19

00:01:18.620 --> 00:01:24.620

So we're saying select employees that name from employees join the managers on and we're going to join



20

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:30.800

them together on the employees managed by column to the managers ID column and then we're going to say



21

00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.530

where the manager's name is like the string.



22

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:34.850

Sandy Kim.



23

00:01:34.850 --> 00:01:40.310

So that's a way you would be able to get the employee who is being managed by Sandy Kim without knowing



24

00:01:40.310 --> 00:01:42.310

Sandy Kym's ID number.



25

00:01:42.680 --> 00:01:45.130

And if you first solved it this way.



26

00:01:45.410 --> 00:01:47.500

Most likely an interviewer is going to ask you.



27

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:52.850

Let's assume that you don't know what the ID is and they're hoping for you to answer it in this fashion.



28

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.420

OK.



29

00:01:53.540 --> 00:01:55.430

Thanks everyone and I'll see you at the next lecture.
