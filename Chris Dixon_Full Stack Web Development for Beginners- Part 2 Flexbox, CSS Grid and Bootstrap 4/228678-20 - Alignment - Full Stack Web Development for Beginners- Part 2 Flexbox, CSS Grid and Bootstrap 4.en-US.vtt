00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
We now going to move away from our layout and focus on alignment.

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:10.080
Lots of what we cover in this video is similar to the flexbox,

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:17.155
where we align items at the start and center off stretch to fill space.

00:00:17.155 --> 00:00:21.290
Coordinate the items has taken up all the available space.

00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:25.095
We need to make the items a little smaller to align them.

00:00:25.095 --> 00:00:31.215
Let's first comment out the tracks and these are the ones in the main section.

00:00:31.215 --> 00:00:38.640
Template columns and template rows then set a size for the items.

00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.475
The Items class, which will have just here,

00:00:43.475 --> 00:00:46.415
let's first remove the padding and then add

00:00:46.415 --> 00:00:51.415
a height to the individual items of 60 pixels.

00:00:51.415 --> 00:00:57.695
Reload, we can see by default the items are set a stretch across the row.

00:00:57.695 --> 00:01:00.905
First we're going to look at justify items,

00:01:00.905 --> 00:01:07.445
which we add to the container to affect all child items as a group on the row axis.

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:09.905
A lot of these will be familiar already,

00:01:09.905 --> 00:01:15.665
such as end to place the items at the end of the row and also start.

00:01:15.665 --> 00:01:18.230
Go over to the main section,

00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:21.990
which is a container for these grid items.

00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:24.965
Just here we can add,

00:01:24.965 --> 00:01:32.295
justify items and set them to the end, refresh.

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:35.375
Now all items are pushed to the end of the row.

00:01:35.375 --> 00:01:40.290
We also have start and you can probably guess what this does too,

00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:43.520
this moves everything to the start.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:46.715
Remember the second item which is used here,

00:01:46.715 --> 00:01:50.130
if we scroll back down, has more text.

00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:52.890
Therefore it fills more the available space.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:57.375
We can reinstate this for all the items move the same.

00:01:57.375 --> 00:02:00.780
Let's rename this item two.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:04.305
There we go, all items are now equal.

00:02:04.305 --> 00:02:07.800
The default value for this is stretch,

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:12.000
select replace, start with stretch.

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.940
How much you get the same effect which you began with,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:17.565
we'll also have centered too.

00:02:17.565 --> 00:02:20.150
This will replace all the items in the center of

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.235
the row with width being determined by the content inside.

00:02:25.235 --> 00:02:30.425
We also have the option of baseline too if we're aligning the text.

00:02:30.425 --> 00:02:33.605
Next, we can also use align items.

00:02:33.605 --> 00:02:36.515
This also applies to the parent container,

00:02:36.515 --> 00:02:41.410
will affect the items along the column this time rather than the row.

00:02:41.410 --> 00:02:45.275
To say this, we need some more height to work with.

00:02:45.275 --> 00:02:47.315
Inside the main section,

00:02:47.315 --> 00:02:50.285
let's make the main a little bit higher.

00:02:50.285 --> 00:02:57.820
The height of 1200 pixels and then we can set align items.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:06.570
Let's begin with center over to the browser, refresh.

00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:12.155
Now we'll have a taller main section and all the items are aligned to the center.

00:03:12.155 --> 00:03:14.750
We can see at the top we have an equal gap at the top

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.845
here and also the bottom section too.

00:03:17.845 --> 00:03:21.260
I'm not going to go through all these options because we can use

00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:25.700
the same values as we have just looked at and all work the same way,

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.625
but this time on the opposite axis.

00:03:28.625 --> 00:03:34.415
The next two properties we apply to the child items to control them individually.

00:03:34.415 --> 00:03:37.825
Let's re-introduce our item one class.

00:03:37.825 --> 00:03:40.800
This can be any of the items.

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:45.965
Let's just add this in and then we can control these one individual item.

00:03:45.965 --> 00:03:49.190
Then backup to the main section, going to comment out,

00:03:49.190 --> 00:03:55.230
justify items, and also align items too so that they don't interfere.

00:03:55.430 --> 00:04:00.470
Now we can go back up to the item one and then we can

00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:06.035
align individual item but this time we use justify itself.

00:04:06.035 --> 00:04:10.665
Let's begin with end and then over to the browser,

00:04:10.665 --> 00:04:14.160
refresh and because this also works on the row,

00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:17.355
this pushes this blue item to the end.

00:04:17.355 --> 00:04:23.180
In fact I think this is being a little bit messed up with these grid columns.

00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.330
It is now we have all these items,

00:04:29.330 --> 00:04:33.800
set the stretch, and then this individual item on the end of the row.

00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:39.685
Center will also do as expected and move this one item into the middle of the row.

00:04:39.685 --> 00:04:41.805
Changes to be center,

00:04:41.805 --> 00:04:46.655
and remember we'll have all the same properties available as we just looked up.

00:04:46.655 --> 00:04:52.250
Save and then refresh and that's our item now in the center of this row.

00:04:52.250 --> 00:04:55.805
If one is to be centered on the column rather than the row.

00:04:55.805 --> 00:04:58.670
We also have align-self.

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:04.910
Let's give this a go and also set this to be the center.

00:05:05.370 --> 00:05:10.120
Now this is centered across the row and column.

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:14.660
Using both justify-self and align-self together is

00:05:14.660 --> 00:05:20.300
a really easy way to center an item both vertically and horizontally.

00:05:20.300 --> 00:05:24.745
This used to be a lot more complex before grid and flexbox.

00:05:24.745 --> 00:05:27.715
Let's go ahead and try one more,

00:05:27.715 --> 00:05:31.820
align- self, set this at the end.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:37.350
Take a look at this and now the item is pushed to the bottom.

00:05:37.350 --> 00:05:41.585
We can see we have lots of useful options when using the grid,

00:05:41.585 --> 00:05:46.560
which causes of pretty much any type of layout we will ever need.
