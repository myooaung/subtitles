00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:02.760
In the last few sections,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.880
we've learned a lot about how to create and change layouts.

00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:12.060
A lot of the historic ways of creating layouts involved using tables of loads.

00:00:12.060 --> 00:00:15.734
We've already talked about the limitations of these methods

00:00:15.734 --> 00:00:19.620
and why they are not ideal for laying out pages.

00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:24.765
In this section, we're going to be looking at both the flexbox and grid.

00:00:24.765 --> 00:00:30.180
These modern layer methods make laying out Web-pages so much easier.

00:00:30.180 --> 00:00:33.945
We're going to begin with the CSS Flexbox.

00:00:33.945 --> 00:00:39.045
Flexbox was designed to be used for one dimensional layout,

00:00:39.045 --> 00:00:42.445
meaning it deals with one axis at the time,

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:45.095
either a row or a column.

00:00:45.095 --> 00:00:47.020
Just like you can see here.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:49.980
Not only does Flexbox control the direction,

00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:55.160
but it also allows us to set the alignment to, like we have here.

00:00:55.160 --> 00:00:59.870
We can align an item or a group of items to the left or right,

00:00:59.870 --> 00:01:03.495
or even to the top or bottom.

00:01:03.495 --> 00:01:09.205
Flexbox also allows us to control the size of the individual items too.

00:01:09.205 --> 00:01:11.030
Here on the top row,

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:12.725
we have two boxes,

00:01:12.725 --> 00:01:17.285
taking up one part and then an item taking up two parts.

00:01:17.285 --> 00:01:18.860
Then for the second row,

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:20.735
we have two items.

00:01:20.735 --> 00:01:24.215
One item taken up three times the size of the order.

00:01:24.215 --> 00:01:30.079
These also flexible to meaning if there is more or even less space available,

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:34.330
these three parts will always be in proportion to the one part.

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:38.000
Another great feature of flexbox is the ability to

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.645
control the order in which the items appear on the page.

00:01:41.645 --> 00:01:46.690
Traditionally, elements appear in the order of a place them in the HTML file.

00:01:46.690 --> 00:01:50.760
Flexbox allows us to control this source order.

00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:56.225
This can be particularly useful when switching elements around for different layouts.

00:01:56.225 --> 00:01:59.510
We could have certain elements in one order,

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:04.540
for larger screens, and then a completely different order for smaller screens.

00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:07.550
Before we jump into building something with flexbox,

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:11.615
there is one important concept to first understand.

00:02:11.615 --> 00:02:14.780
This is the main and cross axis.

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:18.620
We define the main axis by setting the flex direction.

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:22.340
Row is at defaults and this places the items in

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.425
a left to right row on a standard left-to-right browser.

00:02:26.425 --> 00:02:28.425
As you can see on the right,

00:02:28.425 --> 00:02:33.240
row-reverse is the opposite and this appears from right to left.

00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:36.575
Then we have column which is the top to bottom,

00:02:36.575 --> 00:02:38.600
and then also column-reverse,

00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:41.705
which is opposite of bottom to top.

00:02:41.705 --> 00:02:44.285
When we set this flex direction,

00:02:44.285 --> 00:02:47.335
this will be considered the main axis.

00:02:47.335 --> 00:02:52.025
Then the cross axis runs perpendicular to the main axis.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:55.370
So if I had flex direction set to row,

00:02:55.370 --> 00:02:58.060
column will be the cross axis.

00:02:58.060 --> 00:03:01.115
Also, if we set the flex direction to column,

00:03:01.115 --> 00:03:04.195
then row would then become the cross axis.

00:03:04.195 --> 00:03:08.135
So if this is a little bit difficult to understand right now,

00:03:08.135 --> 00:03:12.170
just remember that the main axis is a direction we set,

00:03:12.170 --> 00:03:15.505
and then the cross axis is the opposite.

00:03:15.505 --> 00:03:19.850
This is a basic overview of how the flexbox works.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:25.860
In the next video, we will set it up in our text editor and see in action.
