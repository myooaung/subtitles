00:00:00.120 --> 00:00:07.150
The CSS grid also allows us to set a range for the truck size by adding the minimum,

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.830
maximum size, which should be.

00:00:09.830 --> 00:00:16.165
We do this with the min-max function and we can do this inside of our columns or rows.

00:00:16.165 --> 00:00:18.145
If we go to the Columns to begin,

00:00:18.145 --> 00:00:23.105
we can remove this repeats and then replace it with the min max function.

00:00:23.105 --> 00:00:27.490
Inside the brackets, this also takes in two values.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:30.500
The first is the minimum size of the column.

00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:36.805
Let's say 160 pixels and then the second value is the maximum size,

00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:39.535
let's go for 200 pixels.

00:00:39.535 --> 00:00:45.530
This section will apply to the first column and let's add a couple of more columns in.

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:47.930
The second mode can be one fr,

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:54.520
and then the third one will make it twice the size of 1fr, then over to the browser.

00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:57.755
This first one is the one we interested in.

00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:04.645
This is one using min-max and the size should be between 160 and 200 pixels.

00:01:04.645 --> 00:01:06.420
To check this is working,

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:11.280
we open up the developer tools and inspect the first column.

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:17.540
Let's go over to the inspector.

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:19.160
If we open this item,

00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.505
we can see the size is set to 200 pixels.

00:01:22.505 --> 00:01:24.540
Then the second one is 1fr,

00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:27.805
so we'll take one path of the available space.

00:01:27.805 --> 00:01:30.345
The third one is set it at 2fr,

00:01:30.345 --> 00:01:32.780
so it should be twice the available space.

00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:37.040
This is 518 and this one is 259,

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:38.905
which is exactly half.

00:01:38.905 --> 00:01:41.570
We can also better see this min-max in

00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:45.970
action by shrinking the browser down to smaller size.

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:48.930
Then let open over this first item again

00:01:48.930 --> 00:01:51.965
and you can see even though its browser is really small,

00:01:51.965 --> 00:01:55.990
we now have a minimum value of 160 pixels.

00:01:55.990 --> 00:01:59.870
This min-max function is really useful when we want to have

00:01:59.870 --> 00:02:05.910
fine control over the size our track display and this is how we can use it.
