00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:07.560
We now move on to another powerful technique for laying out websites called the CSS grid.

00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:10.170
Grid solves pretty much all of

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:14.970
the layout problems Web developers have had to work around in the past.

00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:18.000
The flexbox, which we just looked at,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:21.170
helps solve a lot of these layout problems too,

00:00:21.170 --> 00:00:23.885
but it is one dimensional.

00:00:23.885 --> 00:00:28.680
We can only work in either columns or rows at one time.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:34.775
Grid, on the other hand, is truly flexible and allows us to work in two dimensions.

00:00:34.775 --> 00:00:39.345
This means it can be easily used to layout a full website,

00:00:39.345 --> 00:00:45.120
whereas flexbox is generally better suited to smaller alignments and positioning.

00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.960
They can be both used together and actually work together very well.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:55.300
Let's waste no time in jumping straight in to learn about the grid.
