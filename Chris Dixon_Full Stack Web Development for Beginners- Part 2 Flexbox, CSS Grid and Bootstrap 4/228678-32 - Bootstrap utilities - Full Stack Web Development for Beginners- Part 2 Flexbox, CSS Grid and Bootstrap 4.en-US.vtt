00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.795
As we already know, Bootstrap is just HTML,

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:06.255
CSS, and some JavaScript.

00:00:06.255 --> 00:00:10.110
If we want to add any CSS such as margin and padding,

00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:15.690
we can still select any of our Bootstrap classes or elements and then add them to

00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:21.490
our own CSS file and then change the CSS properties as we've previously.

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.880
There is another way which Bootstrap provides

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.795
us and this is with some useful utility helpers.

00:00:27.795 --> 00:00:31.590
If we go of to the Bootstrap documentation and

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:35.805
then in the menu on the left-hand side, click on "Utilities".

00:00:35.805 --> 00:00:39.335
Utilities are basically a way for us to quickly add

00:00:39.335 --> 00:00:44.590
some styles to an element without even having to go to the CSS file.

00:00:44.590 --> 00:00:47.930
Starting with borders, we can see here we can add

00:00:47.930 --> 00:00:52.000
borders to an element with some descriptive class names.

00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.510
We have border, which will apply a border to all four sides.

00:00:56.510 --> 00:00:58.370
We also have border top,

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:01.555
right, bottom, and left too.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:03.995
If we take a look at the menu on the left,

00:01:03.995 --> 00:01:09.420
we can see these helpers are available for most common CSS properties.

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.475
In fact, we've already used some of these already in our project.

00:01:13.475 --> 00:01:15.750
If we click on "Flex",

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:20.045
we can take a look at the flexbox section and scroll down.

00:01:20.045 --> 00:01:23.680
We see some flex values we can add as a class.

00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:28.385
We've already used justify content between for our form section,

00:01:28.385 --> 00:01:32.605
who will have access to all of the flexbox utilities.

00:01:32.605 --> 00:01:38.595
If we also go down and click on "Text", just here,

00:01:38.595 --> 00:01:40.790
also looking at this text section,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.445
we've already used the tech center class,

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:45.525
which we can see just here.

00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:47.565
There's also text left,

00:01:47.565 --> 00:01:55.070
text right and also some utilities to only apply this on different viewport sizes.

00:01:55.070 --> 00:01:58.375
Scrolling further down, we have sizing,

00:01:58.375 --> 00:02:02.625
and we've already used this before inside of our carousel.

00:02:02.625 --> 00:02:05.535
We've used the W 100 class,

00:02:05.535 --> 00:02:11.160
which we have here and this set our images to be 100 percent of the available width.

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.315
There's also space in utilities

00:02:13.315 --> 00:02:17.135
here and this is what we are going to look at in this video.

00:02:17.135 --> 00:02:22.690
This is used to add some margin and padding values to our CSS.

00:02:22.690 --> 00:02:25.460
If we take a look at how we can use this,

00:02:25.460 --> 00:02:27.880
we need to construct a class name.

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:31.500
We build this up beginning with an M or a P,

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.915
which stands for margin or padding.

00:02:33.915 --> 00:02:36.270
Then after this m or p,

00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.580
we then specify which side of the element we want it to apply to.

00:02:40.580 --> 00:02:42.740
We can add T for top,

00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:44.810
B for bottom, left,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:46.735
right, and so on.

00:02:46.735 --> 00:02:49.850
If we wanted to add some margin to the right,

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.540
we start with m, r then after these letters,

00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:56.810
we then specify which size we want to add with

00:02:56.810 --> 00:03:01.975
a number from zero to five or we also have the option of auto.

00:03:01.975 --> 00:03:06.965
Zero will reset any default margin and padding back to zero.

00:03:06.965 --> 00:03:11.225
Two would give us a value of 0.5 rams and so on.

00:03:11.225 --> 00:03:15.335
We also have x which will apply the classes to the left and right,

00:03:15.335 --> 00:03:18.190
or y, which is for the top and bottom.

00:03:18.190 --> 00:03:22.495
Let's go over to our project and if we shrink the browser down,

00:03:22.495 --> 00:03:25.625
we're going to start inside of the navigation.

00:03:25.625 --> 00:03:30.775
Let's drop this down and we're going to begin getting to work on his form section.

00:03:30.775 --> 00:03:33.770
First, we want to add some classes to make this look a little

00:03:33.770 --> 00:03:37.760
nicer and then we use some of the spacing utilities.

00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:43.675
Let's open up our text editor and then get to work in our header section.

00:03:43.675 --> 00:03:47.530
We scroll down to our form inside this header.

00:03:47.530 --> 00:03:53.460
In fact, let's remove this carousel from the header and just place

00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:59.530
this afterwards so scroll route downs after these controls,

00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.620
cut this section out,

00:04:03.230 --> 00:04:07.115
then down at the bottom of our header,

00:04:07.115 --> 00:04:14.575
let's paste this outside and to make sure this is all okay, expand the browser.

00:04:14.575 --> 00:04:19.180
Great. Now we just have our navigation inside the header.

00:04:19.180 --> 00:04:24.045
Let's get to work with our form section by adding some Bootstrap classes.

00:04:24.045 --> 00:04:32.730
Just here we can add a form class of form-in line and then we can add some margin,

00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:34.410
we can use m y.

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:37.205
This will apply some margin on the y-axis,

00:04:37.205 --> 00:04:40.955
which is above and below and then the value of 2,

00:04:40.955 --> 00:04:44.430
save that, reload and

00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:49.070
the drop-down will now have some margin on the top and bottom of the form.

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:53.705
Then we can go ahead and make this look a little nicer with some Bootstrap classes.

00:04:53.705 --> 00:04:58.600
First of all, the inputs can have a class of form control.

00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:03.455
Then we add the type for the input of text,

00:05:03.455 --> 00:05:07.470
and then a placeholder value of search.

00:05:07.540 --> 00:05:11.290
Now, the button, we've got the type of submit,

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.265
let's just add some classes to this.

00:05:14.265 --> 00:05:16.400
The first one can be btn,

00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:22.425
which we've seen before, then btn outline-success.

00:05:22.425 --> 00:05:26.855
Outline will make sure that this color only applies as a border

00:05:26.855 --> 00:05:31.115
rather than a solid color and success will give us the green color,

00:05:31.115 --> 00:05:35.020
which we'll see just here.

00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:39.170
These are on separate lines because we're on a smaller view here.

00:05:39.170 --> 00:05:40.970
If we make this a little bit wider,

00:05:40.970 --> 00:05:44.260
we now get these components now in line.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:46.985
This my2, which we've added here,

00:05:46.985 --> 00:05:50.165
will apply margin for all screen sizes.

00:05:50.165 --> 00:05:54.880
We can also set a different margin value for other screen sizes too.

00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.380
For example, if we wanted to reduce this margin on medium-sized devices and above,

00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:08.770
we could add my-md medium devices and then reduce this down to be 1 rather than 2.

00:06:08.770 --> 00:06:12.000
If we save and refresh,

00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:14.424
now when we make the browser,

00:06:14.424 --> 00:06:19.745
the medium-sized devices, this margin is now reduced on the form.

00:06:19.745 --> 00:06:24.695
Great. Now we have different margin values for above medium sized devices.

00:06:24.695 --> 00:06:28.435
This search button is also a little too close to this inputs.

00:06:28.435 --> 00:06:31.565
It would look a little nicer with some spacing in between.

00:06:31.565 --> 00:06:35.455
To fix this, we can add some margin to this input too.

00:06:35.455 --> 00:06:37.935
This inputs just here,

00:06:37.935 --> 00:06:40.635
let's add a new class of mr,

00:06:40.635 --> 00:06:42.480
which is margin, right.

00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:44.670
Then small devices and above,

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:49.590
let's set this to be 2, refresh and there we go,

00:06:49.590 --> 00:06:55.235
so that's a margin on the right hand side and this should apply on smaller devices,

00:06:55.235 --> 00:06:58.050
which just here and above.

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:03.155
Good. If we shrink the browser down to the smallest size,

00:07:03.155 --> 00:07:04.715
which we've seen before,

00:07:04.715 --> 00:07:08.105
this button is also tight against the input.

00:07:08.105 --> 00:07:12.325
Let's add some margin to the button to space this out,

00:07:12.325 --> 00:07:14.310
so down to the button,

00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:16.875
after btn outline success,

00:07:16.875 --> 00:07:21.550
we can use my and then let's set this to be 2.

00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:24.375
Let's see this in action.

00:07:24.375 --> 00:07:26.820
Great. This looks good on the smaller screens.

00:07:26.820 --> 00:07:28.620
If we stretch this,

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.750
so the larger screens.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:34.520
We could also reset this margin for larger screens.

00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:37.895
But it does look fine so I'm going to keep it like this for now.

00:07:37.895 --> 00:07:41.510
Now onto the three images down at the bottom.

00:07:41.510 --> 00:07:44.870
We also need to add some space in to the section.

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.890
I'm going to add some padding to the inside of this elements.

00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.100
Let's go down to the container,

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:56.335
the three images below the carousel.

00:07:56.335 --> 00:08:00.755
It's this one here after container and text center,

00:08:00.755 --> 00:08:07.320
let's add some padding on the y-axis and this can be a value of 5, reload.

00:08:07.320 --> 00:08:10.895
Good. Now we've got some padding on the top and bottom.

00:08:10.895 --> 00:08:13.535
Let's make this container a bit taller,

00:08:13.535 --> 00:08:16.000
add some more equal spacing.

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.545
Finally, to finish off this homepage,

00:08:18.545 --> 00:08:20.845
let's add a footer area,

00:08:20.845 --> 00:08:23.460
back over to the HTML.

00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.435
Right down to the bottom and we'll close this div off.

00:08:27.435 --> 00:08:30.120
We can add a footer section.

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:33.565
This is going to be a simple footer area.

00:08:33.565 --> 00:08:38.580
We're going to begin by adding a back stop button so when the user clicks on it,

00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:41.360
they'll be taken back to the top of the page.

00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:46.160
Then afterwards we'll add a copyright symbol with the name of Gourmet Burgers.

00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.665
We add a home and locations link just to finish things off.

00:08:50.665 --> 00:08:54.440
Let's begin by adding some classes to this footer area.

00:08:54.440 --> 00:09:01.390
We can make this a container and bg-light to give it a light background color.

00:09:01.390 --> 00:09:07.055
To space things out, we an add some padding on the y-axis and a valley of 4,

00:09:07.055 --> 00:09:12.930
open up the p elements and this is going to be our text or back to top.

00:09:12.930 --> 00:09:17.000
In fact, we'll just cut this out and add this in as

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.185
a link with the a elements and paste this inside.

00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:24.530
The p tags can have a class and again,

00:09:24.530 --> 00:09:28.625
this is a utility class of float right,

00:09:28.625 --> 00:09:32.945
This will make the text float to the right-hand side of the page.

00:09:32.945 --> 00:09:38.575
This link can also have a href attribute with a value of a hash.

00:09:38.575 --> 00:09:41.450
This means when a user clicks on this link,

00:09:41.450 --> 00:09:43.430
they'll be redirected back to

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.630
this homepage and then it will start at the very top of the page.

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:49.775
Let's take a look at this.

00:09:49.775 --> 00:09:53.710
Refresh, click on back to top and

00:09:53.710 --> 00:10:00.160
then the page reloads right at the very top so there's our back to top link.

00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:04.070
Then just after this we can add a new set of p tags.

00:10:04.070 --> 00:10:06.620
This is going to contain our text of

00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.850
Gourmet Burgers with the copyright symbol and then add two links,

00:10:10.850 --> 00:10:14.230
which is going to be for home and locations.

00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:17.030
Just after this opening p tag,

00:10:17.030 --> 00:10:20.359
I'm going to add the HTML entity of copyright,

00:10:20.359 --> 00:10:23.889
which is ampersand copy and a semicolon,

00:10:23.889 --> 00:10:28.870
and then the textile of 2018 Gourmet Burgers.

00:10:29.990 --> 00:10:33.590
Then I'm going to add a second HTML entity,

00:10:33.590 --> 00:10:35.920
which is called mid dot.

00:10:35.920 --> 00:10:38.990
This is simply going to be a dot which will separate

00:10:38.990 --> 00:10:43.540
this text here from the links which we're going to add in next.

00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:50.665
Next up, we can add two links for home and locations still within this p tag here.

00:10:50.665 --> 00:10:55.025
Let's add our first link with the text of home.

00:10:55.025 --> 00:10:59.094
This can have a empty href attribute,

00:10:59.094 --> 00:11:01.790
as we don't have anything to link to.

00:11:01.790 --> 00:11:06.170
Just after this link, we can also add this mid dot once

00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:11.735
more to separate our two links and then we can add our last link,

00:11:11.735 --> 00:11:14.630
which is going to be for all locations.

00:11:14.630 --> 00:11:18.874
Again, this can also have the empty href,

00:11:18.874 --> 00:11:23.085
give that a save, out to the browser.

00:11:23.085 --> 00:11:27.065
Good. So if we zoom in and then scroll down to the very bottom,

00:11:27.065 --> 00:11:29.285
there's a link which is back to the top,

00:11:29.285 --> 00:11:33.020
which is floated to the right with this utility

00:11:33.020 --> 00:11:37.939
here then we have our copyright symbol and the text of Gourmet Burgers,

00:11:37.939 --> 00:11:43.675
a dot in between to separate our links of home and locations.

00:11:43.675 --> 00:11:48.470
This is it now for our project and also our spacing utilities.

00:11:48.470 --> 00:11:50.510
I hope you can now see how using

00:11:50.510 --> 00:11:54.590
Bootstrap can really give us a head start when building websites.

00:11:54.590 --> 00:11:59.840
Of course, all the default styles are not always going to be exactly what we're looking

00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:06.445
for and it is encouraged to override them and make customizations to suit your needs.

00:12:06.445 --> 00:12:11.830
This is it now for our lookup Bootstrap and I'll see you in the next section.
