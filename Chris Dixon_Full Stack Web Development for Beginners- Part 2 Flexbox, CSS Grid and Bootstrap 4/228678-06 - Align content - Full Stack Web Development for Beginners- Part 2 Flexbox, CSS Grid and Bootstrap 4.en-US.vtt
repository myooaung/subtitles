00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:04.365
Next up we're going to take a look at align-content.

00:00:04.365 --> 00:00:07.935
I know we're seeing quite a few terms to get our head around here.

00:00:07.935 --> 00:00:10.230
Though you can think of align-content as

00:00:10.230 --> 00:00:14.115
similar to justify-content, which we've already used.

00:00:14.115 --> 00:00:19.260
But this time it applies to the cross axis rather than the main axis.

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:23.085
For this, we need a few more rows of content.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:27.555
So let's move these styles which were added in last time.

00:00:27.555 --> 00:00:31.739
So the first one, the horizontal line,

00:00:31.739 --> 00:00:39.010
these two lines here and then the final two, style attributes.

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:47.895
Remove that. Then I'm going to copy the six items once more and then paste them in.

00:00:47.895 --> 00:00:53.340
In fact we paste these in two more times it goes 18 different items.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:56.505
Save that and then refresh.

00:00:56.505 --> 00:00:59.685
So we now have about three lines of content to work

00:00:59.685 --> 00:01:02.705
with if we shrink the browser down a little.

00:01:02.705 --> 00:01:06.980
It would also help for this demo if we set a background color to

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:11.900
the container and also set it to be the full height of the screen.

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.835
So within this container,

00:01:13.835 --> 00:01:16.305
let's add some CSS.

00:01:16.305 --> 00:01:19.215
First of all, the backgrounds.

00:01:19.215 --> 00:01:22.300
I want to go for light-green.

00:01:22.300 --> 00:01:27.600
Then set the height to be full screen with 100vh.

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:30.605
Remember vh is a relative size which

00:01:30.605 --> 00:01:34.350
just has to be a 100 percent of the view-port height.

00:01:36.230 --> 00:01:43.335
Finally, let's remove this align-items and justify-content from previous videos.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:45.180
I'm just going to comment this out.

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:48.315
So it's still there , then refresh.

00:01:48.315 --> 00:01:51.435
So now we can get to work on align-content.

00:01:51.435 --> 00:01:54.135
Remember we're still working on the cross axis.

00:01:54.135 --> 00:01:57.670
All this will be applying from top to bottom.

00:01:57.670 --> 00:02:00.755
Just like align-items which we looked at before.

00:02:00.755 --> 00:02:04.535
Stretch is also the default for align-content too.

00:02:04.535 --> 00:02:09.715
This is why all of our items and technically full height of the viewportt.

00:02:09.715 --> 00:02:14.930
We also have a familiar flex-start too and also flex-end.

00:02:14.930 --> 00:02:18.985
Let's see how these look in align-content.

00:02:18.985 --> 00:02:23.880
Flex-start to begin with, and then refresh.

00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:26.945
Now we don't have the default stretch value

00:02:26.945 --> 00:02:30.125
and all items that are at the start of the cross axis,

00:02:30.125 --> 00:02:32.125
which is the top of the page.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:33.945
As you probably imagine,

00:02:33.945 --> 00:02:39.245
flex-end pushes this to the bottom of the page and then rises up to the top.

00:02:39.245 --> 00:02:43.370
So let us demonstrate this with flex-end refresh,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.810
and now everything is down at the bottom of the cross axis.

00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:50.080
We also have center too.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:54.290
Which will push everything to the middle of

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.955
the height or the middle of the cross axis in this case.

00:02:57.955 --> 00:03:00.845
You should be starting to see a pattern here too.

00:03:00.845 --> 00:03:04.355
Most of the properties will looked at are pretty much the same,

00:03:04.355 --> 00:03:07.600
but just applied to a different axis.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:09.905
Just like justify content,

00:03:09.905 --> 00:03:13.910
there is also a space-between and space-around too.

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:17.610
Let's start with space-between.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.975
This applies all the space in between items.

00:03:21.975 --> 00:03:25.220
Like we just mentioned, we also have space-around

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:29.050
and this will give us equals space around all the items.

00:03:29.050 --> 00:03:30.795
From top to bottom,

00:03:30.795 --> 00:03:35.345
half of the space is on top of the item and the other half is below the item.

00:03:35.345 --> 00:03:40.715
This gives us the effect of having twice the amount of space in between each item.

00:03:40.715 --> 00:03:45.540
If we change the main axis is time to be column.

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:48.535
Then refresh the browser.

00:03:48.535 --> 00:03:51.975
Now column sets the main axis to be vertical.

00:03:51.975 --> 00:03:55.565
This means a horizontal is now the cross axis.

00:03:55.565 --> 00:03:59.630
This causes align-content and now apply across the page,

00:03:59.630 --> 00:04:02.695
since this is now the cross axis.

00:04:02.695 --> 00:04:08.020
So let's go ahead and change it back to row and then reload the browser.

00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:13.070
This is one of those things which just needs a bit of practice to get our head around.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:15.860
Once you start using it inside our CSS,

00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.360
more regularly, things will become a lot easier.

00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.540
This is it for now for spacing out the items and I will see you in the next video.
