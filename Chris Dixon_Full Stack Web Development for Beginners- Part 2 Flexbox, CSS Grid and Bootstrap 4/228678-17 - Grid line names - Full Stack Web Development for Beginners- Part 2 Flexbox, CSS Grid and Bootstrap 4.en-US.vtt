00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.290
In the last video, we looked at grid lines and how they're numbered.

00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:10.755
Grid also gives us the ability to name these grid lines to something more appropriate.

00:00:10.755 --> 00:00:16.140
You will often come across names such as row start or row end.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:22.905
Another useful way is to name them relating to the section of all page such as a header,

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.890
footer, sidebar and so on.

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.075
We're now going to return back to adding properties to the container.

00:00:30.075 --> 00:00:34.320
We can return item 1 to just being item.

00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.760
Let's remove the one off the end of here and

00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:41.450
now if we scroll back up to our container CSS,

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:44.255
we can go ahead and add our columns.

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:48.410
Let's remove this repeat from here and all we need to

00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:52.745
do is add a name inside the square brackets for each column,

00:00:52.745 --> 00:00:55.250
followed by the size of the track.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:58.250
We open up and close the square brackets.

00:00:58.250 --> 00:01:06.255
We can set our first one to be called first and then the size of 1FR.

00:01:06.255 --> 00:01:10.070
We can then repeat this with the square brackets again and

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:14.000
call this second and this can be 2FR.

00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:17.975
If we want the third column, exactly the same.

00:01:17.975 --> 00:01:22.520
Name is third, named 1FR and then at

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.775
the very end we can name this last and set this to be 2FR.

00:01:27.775 --> 00:01:32.755
Remember these names inside the square brackets, totally up to you.

00:01:32.755 --> 00:01:37.910
Let's see how this looks and let's see how we're four columns in action.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.790
Goodness, our four columns with 1FR,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:43.735
two, one and then two.

00:01:43.735 --> 00:01:48.005
Also rather than using individual names like we've just done,

00:01:48.005 --> 00:01:54.040
we can repeat the same name for each track such as col-starts and then col-end,

00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:56.745
col-start 2, col-end 2,

00:01:56.745 --> 00:01:59.160
start 3, end 3,

00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:01.710
start 4 and then end 4.

00:02:01.710 --> 00:02:07.510
To achieve this, all we need to do is to add col-start and also col-ends.

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:12.260
Then these numbers will be added automatically after each one to

00:02:12.260 --> 00:02:17.315
distinguish between each column and we can also do exactly the same for rows 2.

00:02:17.315 --> 00:02:22.010
We can achieve this by going back over to the project and using repeat.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:28.335
To begin to add this col-start and col-end to each column,

00:02:28.335 --> 00:02:30.950
we can go ahead and use the repeat method from

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:35.345
before and delete the four individual names,

00:02:35.345 --> 00:02:38.005
then go ahead and add repeat.

00:02:38.005 --> 00:02:41.465
Inside the brackets I'm going to add four columns.

00:02:41.465 --> 00:02:44.390
So add four separated by the comma.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:47.665
Then we can go ahead and add our square brackets.

00:02:47.665 --> 00:02:50.530
The first value we're going to set as

00:02:50.530 --> 00:02:56.035
col-start and this is the name for the start of each individual column.

00:02:56.035 --> 00:02:57.820
It will be col-start,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:01.835
then col-start 2, col-start 3, and so on.

00:03:01.835 --> 00:03:07.600
Then the size we want each column to be unless I want it to be 1FR.

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:13.795
Then a second set of square brackets to add the name to the end of each column.

00:03:13.795 --> 00:03:17.730
In our case we're going to use col-end and then

00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:21.655
save that and also do the same for the rows below.

00:03:21.655 --> 00:03:24.400
We can keep three rows, it's fine.

00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:27.545
We can add the name of row-starts,

00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:38.475
the size of 1FR and then our ending name of row-end give that save and then refresh.

00:03:38.475 --> 00:03:42.845
Then we're back to a standard for four by three grid layout.

00:03:42.845 --> 00:03:46.190
Now we can go ahead and add our item one class back in

00:03:46.190 --> 00:03:51.625
place and we can move the item to where we want using this grid names.

00:03:51.625 --> 00:03:55.575
The first one, it's under class of item 1.

00:03:55.575 --> 00:03:58.455
So we can see the blue item again.

00:03:58.455 --> 00:04:01.700
To make things more clear I'm going to comment out

00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:04.850
the grid area that we used here for item

00:04:04.850 --> 00:04:07.400
1 and then go back to using

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.725
these four individual values so it's a little bit easier to work with.

00:04:11.725 --> 00:04:15.335
Can you have the row to be starting at two and four?

00:04:15.335 --> 00:04:17.225
Let's just leave that for now.

00:04:17.225 --> 00:04:18.875
Instead for the columns,

00:04:18.875 --> 00:04:24.795
let's go for col-start and then end position to me col-end.

00:04:24.795 --> 00:04:28.585
Remember these are the names which we set above inside

00:04:28.585 --> 00:04:33.310
the square brackets. Reload the browser.

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:37.620
As expected, we have the row-start at position two,

00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:39.825
that's one and then two,

00:04:39.825 --> 00:04:45.495
and then it ends up position four which we start with these two values here.

00:04:45.495 --> 00:04:49.265
We then set the columns to be the column-start and column-end.

00:04:49.265 --> 00:04:55.595
Remember the col-starts and col-end is starting and ending position of our first column.

00:04:55.595 --> 00:04:58.490
This is why it has only taken up one section here.

00:04:58.490 --> 00:05:03.215
If we wanted this to span two columns such as over to this one here,

00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:07.110
which then changes to be col-end 2.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:13.910
Now, this starts at the beginning of the first column and ends at the end of column 2.

00:05:13.910 --> 00:05:15.725
Now we want the rows.

00:05:15.725 --> 00:05:21.270
If we set the first value to be row-start and then the second

00:05:21.270 --> 00:05:27.375
one to be row-end 4 of the browser.

00:05:27.375 --> 00:05:31.095
Now, this begins at row-start which is the first row here

00:05:31.095 --> 00:05:35.685
and then ends at row-end 4 which is the fourth one here.

00:05:35.685 --> 00:05:39.215
We do nothing different here than we've already learned.

00:05:39.215 --> 00:05:45.790
The only difference is we're referencing these grid lines by a name rather than a number.

00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:52.770
Next we're going to look at how we can use grid template areas to layout a full websites.
