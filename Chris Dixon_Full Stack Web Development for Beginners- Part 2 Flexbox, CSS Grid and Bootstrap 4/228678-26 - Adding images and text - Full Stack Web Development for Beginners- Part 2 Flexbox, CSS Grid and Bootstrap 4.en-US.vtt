00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.300
Since Bootstrap is just HTML,

00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.630
CSS, and some JavaScript behind the scenes.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:11.085
Adding text and images is just the same as we've already learned.

00:00:11.085 --> 00:00:15.255
Let's begin by setting up all three sections to be four columns,

00:00:15.255 --> 00:00:17.775
the medium devices and above.

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:23.020
So change the call to be MD-4.

00:00:23.270 --> 00:00:26.565
We could do this for all three sections.

00:00:26.565 --> 00:00:29.955
Add MD-4 into these two.

00:00:29.955 --> 00:00:33.680
We don't need these columns anymore so we can remove the background.

00:00:33.680 --> 00:00:37.500
Success, Primary and secondary.

00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:43.490
We'll have the content this time too see the difference between the three sections.

00:00:43.490 --> 00:00:46.025
If we go back over to the finished site,

00:00:46.025 --> 00:00:47.300
which we have just here,

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:52.344
we'll be building the images and all the text for these three sections.

00:00:52.344 --> 00:00:55.140
this is our first four column section,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:57.620
our second, and our third,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:00:59.810
making up the 12-column grid.

00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.660
I've included some images for you to download.

00:01:02.660 --> 00:01:04.760
If you want to use the same as me.

00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:06.710
If not, you can, of course,

00:01:06.710 --> 00:01:09.470
go ahead and choose your own if you prefer.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:11.980
I have these images saved on my desktop.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:16.315
I'm going to go over to the project folder and add these to it.

00:01:16.315 --> 00:01:18.375
Here is my images folder.

00:01:18.375 --> 00:01:22.765
So I'm going to drag these into the gourmet-burgers project.

00:01:22.765 --> 00:01:24.920
With these now inside the project,

00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:29.110
we can now get to work with adding this to our website.

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:34.980
So obviously the index our HTML we're going to work in this container section.

00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:38.970
First of all, this first call, MD-4,

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:41.260
we can move the text,

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.270
and then add to image elements.

00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:47.370
Just like normal HTML,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:49.745
we add the source attributes.

00:01:49.745 --> 00:01:52.840
I added these inside images folder.

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.560
If we open up the sidebar, and then images,

00:01:56.560 --> 00:02:01.455
we have carousel one and carousel 2 for the rotating slider.

00:02:01.455 --> 00:02:04.555
We have three different images down at the bottom here,

00:02:04.555 --> 00:02:07.370
which we're going to use for the three sections.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:11.235
If we close this down, the first one we are going to to add is open.

00:02:11.235 --> 00:02:14.525
This has the dot JPEG extension.

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:18.530
The old text, which we should always add.

00:02:20.210 --> 00:02:22.330
Just below this image,

00:02:22.330 --> 00:02:25.065
we can then go ahead and add some normal elements,

00:02:25.065 --> 00:02:27.310
such as H2 for the title.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:30.770
Let's say over 50 restaurants.

00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.190
Then below this some texts with the P tag 2.

00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.740
For this we add the text of treat yourself next time you're in the area.

00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:49.880
You can change it to any text which you prefer.

00:02:49.880 --> 00:02:51.755
It doesn't really matter.

00:02:51.755 --> 00:02:54.095
Now, over to our projects,

00:02:54.095 --> 00:02:56.315
and then reload the index page.

00:02:56.315 --> 00:02:58.520
You can see we have an image,

00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:02.270
we'll have H2 and then some text.

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:04.310
This image is really big at the moment,

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.490
but we'll fix that soon.

00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.600
Now, on to the middle section,

00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:10.820
we can also remove this text again,

00:03:10.820 --> 00:03:13.625
and replace this with an image.

00:03:13.625 --> 00:03:17.600
The image source is time, is images/challenge.

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:27.360
jpg. The alternative text of eat-in challenge image.

00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.124
Now, below the image.

00:03:34.124 --> 00:03:36.815
If we take a look at the finished site,

00:03:36.815 --> 00:03:38.570
this is what we're looking for now.

00:03:38.570 --> 00:03:41.375
The H2 of fancy challenge,

00:03:41.375 --> 00:03:47.125
and then the text below of why not try one of our famous burger eating challenges.

00:03:47.125 --> 00:03:50.230
Beginning with the H2,

00:03:54.440 --> 00:03:59.080
and then the text below with the p tags.

00:04:05.990 --> 00:04:09.880
So burger eating challenges.

00:04:12.980 --> 00:04:16.150
That's our first two now in place.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:18.415
Then the third one, remove the text,

00:04:18.415 --> 00:04:20.905
and add an image for this third one.

00:04:20.905 --> 00:04:24.990
The source this time is sign.jpg.

00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:27.185
In the images folder,

00:04:27.185 --> 00:04:34.680
sign.jpg, the old text or reputation image.

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:40.390
This is the first section which is over on the right-hand side,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:43.065
which is established 2003.

00:04:43.065 --> 00:04:45.440
Then some text below.

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:53.409
The H2, this will be any texts of your choice.

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:06.400
Over 15 years of high-quality.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:12.140
Once you've included this,

00:05:12.140 --> 00:05:13.735
let's go over to the browser,

00:05:13.735 --> 00:05:15.790
and we'll probably see quite a bit of a mess,

00:05:15.790 --> 00:05:17.535
to be honest if we refresh.

00:05:17.535 --> 00:05:20.055
So there are three different images,

00:05:20.055 --> 00:05:24.950
and the three sections, because the images are far too big to fit in place.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:31.205
To fix this, we can add our own CSS file to override any of the Bootstrap defaults.

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:34.130
So Courtney, if we remember in head section,

00:05:34.130 --> 00:05:36.800
we have the Bootstrap core CSS.

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.775
But this is just a base starting point for us to work with.

00:05:40.775 --> 00:05:45.535
Like we said earlier, there is encouraged to add our own style sheets.

00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:51.290
If we go over to our project folder and then we can add a new file.

00:05:51.290 --> 00:05:56.250
So styles.css for custom styles.

00:05:56.330 --> 00:06:02.400
Now, I'm going to target the call MD-4.

00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.620
Then all images which follow.

00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:09.955
We could of course add the custom class to this if we wanted to.

00:06:09.955 --> 00:06:12.380
But let's just stick with the classes that we have.

00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:20.980
So width will have 140 pixels to keep them quite small and a height of a 140 pixels too.

00:06:20.980 --> 00:06:25.705
Because remember these just intended to be thumbnail size images.

00:06:25.705 --> 00:06:29.590
Of course, we need to link this in index page.

00:06:29.590 --> 00:06:33.490
So our custom CSS always goes right to the bottom.

00:06:33.490 --> 00:06:37.385
So we can override any of these default styles for both.

00:06:37.385 --> 00:06:45.545
So the link relationship is style sheet, the href.

00:06:45.545 --> 00:06:48.895
So this is the same level as the index page.

00:06:48.895 --> 00:06:56.200
This can just go in the href as styles.css and then close this off.

00:06:56.200 --> 00:07:00.555
Once you have done that,

00:07:00.555 --> 00:07:03.255
let's see how this looks in the browser.

00:07:03.255 --> 00:07:08.635
Good. Now, all three columns are now side-by-side with the small images,

00:07:08.635 --> 00:07:11.750
page too and also the text.

00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:14.350
The next content to add to this section,

00:07:14.350 --> 00:07:16.450
if we go to the finished version here,

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:19.060
is these buttons which are down at the bottom.

00:07:19.060 --> 00:07:21.400
These bonds are pretty simple to add.

00:07:21.400 --> 00:07:23.155
These just anchor tags,

00:07:23.155 --> 00:07:26.450
which some Bootstrap classes to make them look nicer.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.650
Back over to the text editor,

00:07:28.650 --> 00:07:31.575
and then to our first section,

00:07:31.575 --> 00:07:34.245
just after these P tags here.

00:07:34.245 --> 00:07:39.095
I'm going to add some more P tags and next the link inside.

00:07:39.095 --> 00:07:43.054
This link is going to have some Bootstrap classes.

00:07:43.054 --> 00:07:45.980
So this is going to be btn.

00:07:45.980 --> 00:07:49.115
Then btn secondary.

00:07:49.115 --> 00:07:52.520
This will go as a gray color that we seen before.

00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:56.360
These primary, secondary is similar to what we use for

00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.185
the background colors when we look at the grids in the last video.

00:08:00.185 --> 00:08:04.955
These are default styles that Bootstrap provides for different elements.

00:08:04.955 --> 00:08:09.995
In this case, secondary is the gray color that we can see just here.

00:08:09.995 --> 00:08:13.830
Later we use a different color for this green section.

00:08:14.030 --> 00:08:16.515
Back to our button,

00:08:16.515 --> 00:08:19.335
btn and btn and secondary.

00:08:19.335 --> 00:08:22.920
Then we need a link. So the href.

00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:27.530
We can just leave this empty for now as we don't have any pages to link to.

00:08:27.530 --> 00:08:30.610
We'll add a row of button.

00:08:30.610 --> 00:08:35.609
Then the text inside of view details.

00:08:36.190 --> 00:08:39.650
After this, we're going to add this right arrow,

00:08:39.650 --> 00:08:41.845
which is this one just here.

00:08:41.845 --> 00:08:44.510
This is done with an HTML entity.

00:08:44.510 --> 00:08:48.185
Remember, HTML entities begin with ampersands.

00:08:48.185 --> 00:08:52.415
The entity code for the arrows is raquo,

00:08:52.415 --> 00:08:55.120
and this must end in a semicolon.

00:08:55.120 --> 00:09:02.095
Save that. Then there's our button with the arrows on the right hand side.

00:09:02.095 --> 00:09:07.345
I'm going to copy this button and paste it in to the other two sections.

00:09:07.345 --> 00:09:10.115
So copy this link that we just added in.

00:09:10.115 --> 00:09:14.910
Then next we cannot days at the end of our second area.

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:18.470
Then the third area,

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:22.350
just underneath our reputation does not lie.

00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.525
Add that end three times.

00:09:26.525 --> 00:09:29.785
Now, it's in our tree sections on the screen.

00:09:29.785 --> 00:09:32.270
These images now look a lot better.

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.774
Now, they fit inside the containers.

00:09:34.774 --> 00:09:38.900
But we can still take things even further with some Bootstrap classes.

00:09:38.900 --> 00:09:42.410
To make the corners rounded,w e can do this with

00:09:42.410 --> 00:09:46.475
a rounded circle class, which Bootstrap provides.

00:09:46.475 --> 00:09:50.510
The first section here for the restaurants inside

00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.990
the image at the class of rounded circle.

00:09:56.270 --> 00:09:59.740
The same for the second image.

00:10:03.740 --> 00:10:07.720
Then the third and final image.

00:10:12.530 --> 00:10:15.700
Let's see how this looks.

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:19.570
Seems there is a problem this middle one,

00:10:19.570 --> 00:10:22.990
we should add a dash inside of there.

00:10:22.990 --> 00:10:28.155
Okay, good. So these rounded corners are added with the CSS border-radius.

00:10:28.155 --> 00:10:31.855
Bootstrap allows us to add this radius to the top, right,

00:10:31.855 --> 00:10:34.914
bottom left, or circle,

00:10:34.914 --> 00:10:37.905
just like we just use there inside here.

00:10:37.905 --> 00:10:42.070
We can see these classes if we go to getbootstrap.com.

00:10:42.070 --> 00:10:45.415
Then if we go over to the documentation,

00:10:45.415 --> 00:10:49.630
and if we scroll down to utilities,

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:52.170
so have the borders,

00:10:52.170 --> 00:10:54.340
we can add bolder colors.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:10:56.150
This is one that we've just used,

00:10:56.150 --> 00:10:57.290
which is a border-radius.

00:10:57.290 --> 00:11:01.430
We use the rounded circle, which we see here.

00:11:01.430 --> 00:11:06.470
Finally, we can also align this new content to the center of each section.

00:11:06.470 --> 00:11:09.455
So it looks more aligned like these ones here.

00:11:09.455 --> 00:11:14.455
We can do this by adding a text center class to the container.

00:11:14.455 --> 00:11:21.615
So just after container add the class of tech center over to the browser.

00:11:21.615 --> 00:11:26.305
This now aligns all the content to each section.

00:11:26.305 --> 00:11:29.270
Great, so now all the content is centered.

00:11:29.270 --> 00:11:32.240
I'm going to leave this video there and move on to look it up.

00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.650
Bootstrap nav bars.
