00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.285
Welcome back to this brand new section.

00:00:03.285 --> 00:00:04.890
Here we're going to take a look at one of

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.470
the most popular frameworks for building websites,

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:09.420
which is called Bootstrap.

00:00:09.420 --> 00:00:15.605
Bootstrap Crony, at the latest version of version 4 is open source and free to use,

00:00:15.605 --> 00:00:18.560
is a library for HTML, CSS,

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.050
and also JavaScript, which we've not yet

00:00:21.050 --> 00:00:24.475
looked at but don't worry about that at the moment.

00:00:24.475 --> 00:00:27.940
You can find it at getbootstrap.com.

00:00:27.940 --> 00:00:30.710
Some of the components we'll use in Bootstrap,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:32.314
such as a carousel,

00:00:32.314 --> 00:00:34.010
require JavaScript to work.

00:00:34.010 --> 00:00:38.005
But we don't need to know any JavaScript at this stage to use them.

00:00:38.005 --> 00:00:42.005
Bootstrap allows us to quickly get started building projects,

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:47.090
and also allows us to take advantage of lots of pre-built components,

00:00:47.090 --> 00:00:49.340
such as navigation bars,

00:00:49.340 --> 00:00:53.630
image carousels, and forms, to name a few.

00:00:53.630 --> 00:00:57.020
Getting started is also really easy.

00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:03.055
We can just add Bootstrap to our project just like any other CSS file,

00:01:03.055 --> 00:01:06.305
and start writing our website as normal.

00:01:06.305 --> 00:01:13.880
We can then either use a pre-built components or write our own HTML as normal and then

00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.045
take advantage of the Bootstrap CSS classes

00:01:17.045 --> 00:01:21.625
provided to us to give us some base styling to build on.

00:01:21.625 --> 00:01:26.210
If we go ahead and open up the documentation from the navbar,

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:28.070
there is quite a lot to get through,

00:01:28.070 --> 00:01:31.070
and we'll cover lots of this for this section.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:33.110
First of all, I'm going to head over to

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.580
the components on the left-hand side and click on this.

00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.995
Inside here we can see all the different available components tools.

00:01:41.995 --> 00:01:45.400
For example, if we wanted a navbar,

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:48.140
we click on the navbar section and then

00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:51.190
we're given some more information about how to use it.

00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:54.285
We also then get lots of code examples,

00:01:54.285 --> 00:01:56.430
and also the demonstration.

00:01:56.430 --> 00:02:00.004
If we wanted to use this navbar in our project,

00:02:00.004 --> 00:02:02.350
we could copy this code below.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:07.550
This is all the section here which produces this navbar.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:12.680
There is usually some more different examples with some different layout too,

00:02:12.680 --> 00:02:15.400
and you can see all these as we scroll down.

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:17.670
There is also some forms.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.305
Click on the forms elements on the left,

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:22.490
and exactly the same as before.

00:02:22.490 --> 00:02:25.610
We'll then take a view of lots of different examples.

00:02:25.610 --> 00:02:29.450
This all takes advantage of standard HTML elements,

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:32.755
such as inputs, selects, and text areas.

00:02:32.755 --> 00:02:39.095
But Bootstrap then provides some CSS for us to then use by adding the Bootstrap classes,

00:02:39.095 --> 00:02:42.425
such as form-group and form-control,

00:02:42.425 --> 00:02:43.900
just like we can see here.

00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.620
We'll also take a closer look at some more of these components throughout this project,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.185
such as rotating carousels,

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:53.200
and also use modals.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.640
It's also worth noting too that all of these styles that

00:02:56.640 --> 00:03:00.240
Bootstrap provides is just a base starting point.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:05.665
We are free to go ahead and change any of the styles with some custom CSS.

00:03:05.665 --> 00:03:08.325
if you're still not sure what Bootstrap is,

00:03:08.325 --> 00:03:11.720
all you need to understand for now is we can take advantage of

00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:17.035
Bootstrap's predefined CSS to not only make our HTML look a lot better,

00:03:17.035 --> 00:03:20.100
but to also apply some best practices,

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:24.955
and keep our styling looking more consistent across different browsers.

00:03:24.955 --> 00:03:28.235
Now we have a little background into Bootstrap.

00:03:28.235 --> 00:03:32.580
Let's now move on to getting a Bootstrap project setup.
