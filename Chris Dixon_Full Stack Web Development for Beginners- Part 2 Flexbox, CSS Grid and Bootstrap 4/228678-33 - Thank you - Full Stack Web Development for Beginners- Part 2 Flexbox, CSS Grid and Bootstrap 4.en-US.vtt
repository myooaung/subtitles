00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.450
Congratulations on reaching the end of this course.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:06.870
I hope you are now a lot more comfortable laying out websites,

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.610
using the CSS Flexbox,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:10.590
Grid, and Bootstrap 4.

00:00:10.590 --> 00:00:12.570
We started at the very beginning,

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.405
taking a look at the CSS Flexbox.

00:00:15.405 --> 00:00:18.150
Then we moved onto the CSS Grid system,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:22.785
which is an amazing way to create almost any type of layout you could imagine.

00:00:22.785 --> 00:00:25.860
Finally, learned how to use a Bootstrap 4 framework

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:29.460
to allow us to create great looking websites really fast.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:32.459
Or while building a burger restaurant website,

00:00:32.459 --> 00:00:35.710
just put everything you learned into practice.

00:00:35.710 --> 00:00:39.215
Remember all this is just the second part of this course.

00:00:39.215 --> 00:00:41.435
So be sure to check out the next part,

00:00:41.435 --> 00:00:43.040
to gain a deeper knowledge,

00:00:43.040 --> 00:00:47.635
and learn everything you need to know to build full stack applications.

00:00:47.635 --> 00:00:52.620
Bye for now, and I will see you in the next part of this course.
