00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.970
In this video we'll look at the options for payment systems that we can use with newcomers.

2
00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:10.600
There are lots of integrated solutions for collecting payments with newcomers and we'll look at some

3
00:00:11.830 --> 00:00:17.540
We'll also learn how to manage inventory and product tracking directly in the Wordpress dashboard.

4
00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:22.150
By the end of this video you'll be able to set up a client with a simple payment and product tracking

5
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.350
Let's start by logging into the Wordpress dashboard where we've been working with our wew commerce site.

6
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:34.000
And let's check out the two menu items that newcomer's gives us when it's installed.

7
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:40.000
The one we've been working with is the custom post type called products and we've looked at all those

8
00:00:44.890 --> 00:00:52.330
This is where you would manage your tracking and looking at orders coupons reports etc. and under the

9
00:00:52.360 --> 00:00:59.220
Settings button that will open up a number of different settings that we can set.

10
00:00:59.230 --> 00:01:07.420
Now if we go over to check out that will give us our options for what kinds of payments that we might

11
00:01:12.720 --> 00:01:20.110
If you scroll all the way to the bottom of that checkouts tab page you can see that the payment gateway

12
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:30.630
Now a direct bank transfer is something that you can enable a check payment where they would send you

13
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.880
paid before you ship it out or allow the customer to download it.

14
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.240
Cash on delivery.

15
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.860
That's obvious if you have a physical location or if you just want to put in payments manually and then

16
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:57.060
Paypal Pay-Pal is a standard gateway that is really well used and popular.

17
00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.770
fees they charge a little bit per transaction.

18
00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:20.840
that they take as a fee from the seller or the person receiving the payment.

19
00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:27.960
And this is very comparable and even less expensive than having a built in merchant account and a gateway

20
00:02:28.710 --> 00:02:33.560
That is how current card payments were traditionally taken in the past.

21
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:40.650
Pay-Pal I think is the easiest way to get started with allowing you or your clients to take online payments

22
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:45.390
using either a PayPal account or a credit card.

23
00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:51.930
Lots of people feel more comfortable making online payments through a merchant like PayPal because you

24
00:02:55.950 --> 00:03:03.990
Paypal keeps that secure and then processes the payment for you and allows the commerce system to track

25
00:03:11.610 --> 00:03:18.750
are that it allows you to collect credit cards on an online site without charging an upfront fee at

26
00:03:19.770 --> 00:03:26.880
Pay Powles regular pay pal payment system is free to use except for the fees that they take out of payments

27
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:28.700
after you receive the payments.

28
00:03:28.770 --> 00:03:35.760
And at the same time the Pay-Pal standard extension for commerce comes with newcomer's plug in itself

29
00:03:36.040 --> 00:03:42.970
and you don't have to buy an extra extension or any kind of additional functionality so within the commerce

30
00:03:43.060 --> 00:03:46.890
settings page how do you enable people in the first place.

31
00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:54.910
If you click the Pay-Pal item here under the checkout tab you can see that there's an enable and disable

32
00:03:54.950 --> 00:04:01.930
checkbox so you can just click the checkbox to enable Pay-Pal standard and then you can choose the options

33
00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.560
You can edit the description and that's the great thing about Pay-Pal is you can pay with your credit

34
00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:13.100
And I think that's the standard message.

35
00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:20.470
You put an e-mail address that Paypal is associated with you and then you can go down and choose any

36
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:29.800
Generally with just the e-mail address you can set up PayPal standard to check take credit card payments

37
00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:36.900
bank account of yours.

38
00:04:37.730 --> 00:04:43.220
Now there's a number of ways that your web site can engage with PayPal in terms of different extensions

39
00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:50.090
that will comer's has to make your web site able to take payments through paypal Paypal standard is

40
00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.350
And I found this document the Paypal extension comparison by just searching for the word Pay-Pal in

41
00:04:58.730 --> 00:05:01.760
And let's just take a look at some of the different items.

42
00:05:01.790 --> 00:05:07.130
A lot of these extensions are third party extensions that have been made to connect with commerce and

43
00:05:11.420 --> 00:05:17.870
The main difference between Pay-Pal standard and many of these others is that with Pay-Pal standard

44
00:05:18.720 --> 00:05:26.360
if you don't keep the customer on your website when they make their final transaction and many customers

45
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:32.870
and online shoppers are very very familiar with this process we're using Pay-Pal standard when the person

46
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:41.150
in or use a credit card.

47
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.470
And then when they complete the transaction Paypal sends them back to your Web site.

48
00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:53.210
One of the advantages of using something like pay pal pro is that during the entire transaction the

49
00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:03.740
Many people are familiar with paypal and know that if they go and pay with pay pal they get redirected

50
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.400
And that page that you send your customers to can also have your logo and your business name embedded

51
00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:13.190
In the first place.

52
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.750
Another thing about using Pay Pal pro is that an SSL certificate or a secure sockets layer certificate

53
00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:27.610
is required to have people fill out credit card information on the Web site directly by using Paypal

54
00:06:27.650 --> 00:06:28.510
standard.

55
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:36.590
You can use a standard HTP site instead of the HTP s that comes when you use a secure sockets layer

56
00:06:36.620 --> 00:06:37.800
certificate.

57
00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:43.510
We'll talk about SSL certificates and the benefits of using those in the next chapter.

58
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:51.400
Now let's take a quick look inside the Pay-Pal dot com Web site itself so that you can or you can coach

59
00:06:57.910 --> 00:07:03.640
So when you click the sign up button on the right hand side click a business account and you can use

60
00:07:09.700 --> 00:07:16.180
So if you just click business account and then hit next you can see there's two choices you're presented

61
00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:28.810
And then the paper our payments Pro which does cost $30 a month but it allows your customers to stay

62
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:35.060
However it also requires that you have HGT P.S. which will learn about in the next chapter.

63
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.840
But if you click select standard then it'll ask you for some different information you'll verify an

64
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:53.020
you can go on and continue to set up your bank account information and other information paypal needs

65
00:07:54.310 --> 00:08:01.440
And then you'll be able to take credit card payments online with the paypal payments standard set up.

66
00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:06.980
All you need to know is the e-mail address associated with your client's paypal account and you can

67
00:08:14.340 --> 00:08:16.940
Let's take a look at check payments options.

68
00:08:17.250 --> 00:08:22.680
So if you click Check payments and you have that enabled basically there's just a description title

69
00:08:29.070 --> 00:08:31.720
it out anything you want in this field.

70
00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.230
Now of course if you are unable check payments you'll have to receive them in the mail.

71
00:08:36.300 --> 00:08:41.550
Open them and make that deposit and make sure that the funds have cleared your account before you enable

72
00:08:46.920 --> 00:08:50.910
And that's true of the direct bank transfer process as well.

73
00:08:56.340 --> 00:08:58.580
bank account through the wood commerce site.

74
00:08:58.740 --> 00:09:04.990
But again this is not an automatic payment gateway like PayPal or another credit card processor.

75
00:09:05.130 --> 00:09:10.950
You still have to make sure that your bank has received the funds before you open up the product to

76
00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:18.790
So how do you choose which payment option is right for you or for your customer.

77
00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:24.790
There are a lot of options and each has a different fee structure and a different type of setup.

78
00:09:24.910 --> 00:09:31.080
Pay-Pal and Strype are very similar to each other and are excellent payment processors to be able to

79
00:09:39.510 --> 00:09:40.890
documentation site.

80
00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.320
I just found this article by searching for payment options.

81
00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.890
And this is something that you could do some research on and see which types of payment gateways or

82
00:09:56.210 --> 00:10:03.050
The next thing to go over in this video is just the simple ability for Wu commers the in to track your

83
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:11.750
inventory and your customers or clients products inside of their e-commerce store under that Wu comer's

84
00:10:11.840 --> 00:10:19.460
menu item you can look at reports or orders Let's click orders and check out what we have to look at

85
00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:26.190
Basically we will see receive notification in this section when we receive a new order.

86
00:10:26.210 --> 00:10:32.090
You can click learn more about orders by using this button and it'll go to the documentation at newcomer's

87
00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:35.150
dot com under reports.

88
00:10:40.250 --> 00:10:43.430
And over here on the right side are stock reports.

89
00:10:51.650 --> 00:10:57.550
or when it's out-of-stock or what products are the most stocked in your stocking system.

90
00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:05.840
If you look inside of a product itself let's open products and we'll just choose a product right here.

91
00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:14.210
On the product editing page if you scroll down a little bit you can see that one of the items under

92
00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:24.260
If you check the check box it says and label stock management at product level.

93
00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:31.670
That means that you can put in the number of pieces that you have in stock and then you can either allow

94
00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:39.170
You can even choose to allow it but notify the customer that there's been a back order.

95
00:11:45.770 --> 00:11:48.740
item to be sold individually.

96
00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:59.420
In this lesson you learned how to set up credit card processing through paypal and commerce and also

97
00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:06.230
how to enable to other types of payment processing when using the A C S or bank account clearing system

98
00:12:06.380 --> 00:12:07.830
and accepting checks.

99
00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:13.100
The store owner must manually finalize the sale after payment has cleared as opposed to an automated

100
00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:20.780
It will be up to you and your clients to decide which methods are best in the next video will set up

101
00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.750
One of the great things about newcomer's is its ability to manage the downloading permissions for digital

102
00:12:33.620 --> 00:12:34.450
Let's check it out.
