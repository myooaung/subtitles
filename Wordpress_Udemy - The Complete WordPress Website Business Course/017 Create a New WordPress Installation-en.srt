1
00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,260
In this chapter we're going to be building a new website from scratch a simple brochure type site that

2
00:00:08,780 --> 00:00:14,300
We'll start fresh by installing WordPress again locally or at your site Ground server and preparing

3
00:00:19,610 --> 00:00:24,380
You'll be working on your local computer as a staging environment as if you were going to transfer the

4
00:00:26,150 --> 00:00:31,520
You can also use your live environment at site ground for this developing of the site at a new staging

5
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,140
Here's your challenge for this first video of chapter 3.

6
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:42,320
Make sure you've downloaded the latest version of Wordpress and then start map and install WordPress

7
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:45,170
in your local development environment.

8
00:00:51,080 --> 00:00:54,430
Pause the video now and get it set up.

9
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:57,720
If you're using the site Ground server instead.

10
00:00:57,850 --> 00:01:03,760
Your challenge is to set up a fresh WordPress installation manually instead of using the auto installer

11
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:05,320
to do this.

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,370
folder that you'll create under your student domain.

13
00:01:16,990 --> 00:01:23,950
Use the file manager and your code editor as well as the database section of the panel to manually install

14
00:01:23,980 --> 00:01:30,150
WordPress paused the video now and I'll show you how to do both processes.

15
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:34,120
Good luck OK.

16
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:40,030
The first thing I'm going to do is make sure that I have the latest version of Wordpress by going to

17
00:01:46,690 --> 00:01:56,300
and if I open windows explorer and open my wordpress folder you'll see that I do have WordPress 4 5

18
00:01:56,330 --> 00:02:01,790
1 and I did download the zip file and then unzipped it.

19
00:02:02,720 --> 00:02:06,200
And here are my wordpress files.

20
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:13,250
Now I'll go into Seacole and map in another Windows Explorer folder.

21
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:27,100
open data.

22
00:02:27,310 --> 00:02:33,070
Select all the files and hold down control and copy them over

23
00:02:36,950 --> 00:02:39,750
all right now that those files are copied over.

24
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:46,660
I know that they're in a folder called brochure Dasch site and I'm going to go ahead and start map and

25
00:02:47,290 --> 00:02:51,080
get myself ready to look.

26
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,760
That's going to open the map start page in my browser so that I can easily connect with the database

27
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:11,560
DHP my admin is available up at the top menu or down in the content area there and I'm going to create

28
00:03:16,570 --> 00:03:18,130
I'm going to call it brochure site

29
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,210
and hit create.

30
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:30,330
Great now that that's been created I can go ahead and connect the Wordpress WP dash config file

31
00:03:34,700 --> 00:03:37,860
and we are ok inside of brochures site.

32
00:03:47,580 --> 00:03:56,760
and then if I double click that it will open inside of my text and code editor there it is right that

33
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:05,730
I know that database name is the same

34
00:04:14,820 --> 00:04:22,350
if you remember the user name and the password are both in our local installation and the local host

35
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:25,860
needs to identify the port.

36
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,650
And so let's go back.

37
00:04:27,850 --> 00:04:37,670
Let's see we go back into the start page of map I can see that the sequel port is 33 0 6 and this is

38
00:04:45,860 --> 00:04:55,610
So I can define the host inside of the W.P. config file as localhost Colan 33 or 6.

39
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:06,280
Just going to hit control as to save it and now I can just open a new window new tab in my browser localhost

40
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:15,920
slash brochure Dasch site.

41
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,720
If everything is connected properly it should recognize that WordPress isn't quite installed yet and

42
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,130
And go ahead and set up the Web site.

43
00:05:29,410 --> 00:05:33,730
If you do use a password that you can remember for your local computer you have to confirm the use of

44
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:44,850
great.

45
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:52,900
of the Settings tab.

46
00:05:53,740 --> 00:05:56,980
The last few things that I want to do is under settings general

47
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:19,770
set up a few things like the tag line or else the same email address lets choose my time zone those

48
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:22,300
I can leave as the default and save changes.

49
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:33,360
Next under writing I don't think I'll have to change any of these for now but under reading I am going

50
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:47,680
under discussion in media I'm going to leave that as is for now and under Permalink.

51
00:06:47,770 --> 00:06:51,540
I'm definitely going to choose post name and then save changes.

52
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:54,120
Nice job.

53
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,320
Now I'm going to open them to the new site.

54
00:06:57,650 --> 00:06:58,740
In a new tab.

55
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:00,110
Take a look.

56
00:07:04,340 --> 00:07:05,620
One more thing.

57
00:07:05,630 --> 00:07:10,570
I still got the admin bar up at the top of the site here.

58
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:15,590
I'm going to remember to go ahead and go back under my profile and turn that off so that I can look

59
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,950
as the public will see it.

60
00:07:23,210 --> 00:07:23,540
Great.

61
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:29,090
like.

62
00:07:30,570 --> 00:07:36,300
Now for those of you that are using site ground and your live server environment let's manually set

63
00:07:40,770 --> 00:07:47,770
So log in to your site Ground hosting account and then click go to see panel up at the top left.

64
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:55,460
First we have to go into the file manager and create a fresh clean folder and we can call it brochure

65
00:07:56,990 --> 00:08:03,410
Usually I'll dismiss this button for the file manager by clicking show hidden files and also skip this

66
00:08:07,430 --> 00:08:13,470
So here I am in my public HTL mail original WordPress installation area.

67
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:21,170
What I'm going to do is add another folder right inside of public h DML by going up here and clicking

68
00:08:21,320 --> 00:08:23,020
new folder.

69
00:08:23,210 --> 00:08:29,970
I'm going to call it Rosher dash site and I'll create new folder.

70
00:08:30,070 --> 00:08:32,870
So now I have a new folder called brochure site.

71
00:08:32,890 --> 00:08:37,100
If I double click that folder you can see that the directory is empty.

72
00:08:37,160 --> 00:08:45,410
But what I'm going to do is just go to upload and I can hit browse at the top here and here is where

73
00:08:53,090 --> 00:08:54,260
I have saved.

74
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:03,280
So that will click that folder I had and open up the folder that I had unzipped and inside the Wordpress

75
00:09:07,510 --> 00:09:12,040
Now one thing you may have found is by uploading using the file manager.

76
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:21,320
You can't select multiple items and upload them all at once and so there is a solution here.

77
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:26,460
I'll cancel out of that for now and I'm going to open the windows explorer.

78
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:32,950
I've navigated to that WordPress folder and one way to do is select everything inside of it right click

79
00:09:32,980 --> 00:09:39,400
anywhere in there and I'm going to go send to compressed or zipped folder.

80
00:09:45,130 --> 00:09:51,550
file manager and then I can unzip using the file manager right on the server.

81
00:09:51,590 --> 00:09:56,890
So now I have a zip file which is named whatever I had right clicked up here.

82
00:09:56,900 --> 00:09:59,200
If you are on a Mac it'll be called archive.

83
00:09:59,260 --> 00:09:59,650
Zip.

84
00:09:59,690 --> 00:10:00,700
By default.

85
00:10:00,860 --> 00:10:07,880
I'm just going to click that once and then a second time and I'm going to rename it w.

86
00:10:08,150 --> 00:10:14,420
Doesn't matter what we call it just so that we know what it is and so it is a compressed zipped folder

87
00:10:14,750 --> 00:10:22,460
and when we go back to the uploading screen for the file manager we can go over there and find it and

88
00:10:22,490 --> 00:10:25,110
upload it as one file.

89
00:10:32,380 --> 00:10:39,230
There we go a pause the video while this uploads gives me a success message down at the right hand side.

90
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,530
If I just click go back it closes that tab in my browser and I go back and see it right here in the

91
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:52,400
If you highlight that file you can click the extract button up at the top right and then extract files

92
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:55,020
and it quickly extracts everything.

93
00:10:55,190 --> 00:11:02,090
Then you can say reload right here you can see that I got all my Word Press Corps files right inside

94
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:07,640
of my folder which is called brochure Dasch site.

95
00:11:07,810 --> 00:11:11,780
It basically made a copy of all the files that were within the zip file.

96
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:18,460
So if I highlight that zip file I can save a little bit of space by deleting that file.

97
00:11:18,580 --> 00:11:25,390
Now I can highlight the WP dash config dash sample that PSP file and click rename.

98
00:11:29,560 --> 00:11:37,490
And just rename it W.P. dash config dot ph P and click rename file and now we have the WP config file

99
00:11:37,730 --> 00:11:39,010
ready to go.

100
00:11:39,260 --> 00:11:46,800
If I double click this file I can download it to my computer edit it in my code editor and then upload

101
00:11:49,290 --> 00:11:55,980
However there's a feature directly inside the file manager where you can open up a file inside of a

102
00:11:56,190 --> 00:12:03,100
browser based code editor you click code editor with that file highlighted and click Edit.

103
00:12:03,130 --> 00:12:10,410
Now I can see my whole W.P. the ash config dot ph P file inside of the browser and I can go up here

104
00:12:15,250 --> 00:12:22,680
I know I'm going to need a database name a username password and a host name however.

105
00:12:31,660 --> 00:12:38,260
I'm going to create a new database and I'm just going to call this one brochure and the whole name is

106
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:45,230
And then the name that I place here.

107
00:12:45,400 --> 00:12:52,330
So I create the database and it's added the database so I can click go back and you do need to create

108
00:13:00,520 --> 00:13:06,400
And so here are my current databases and if I go down a little bit further you can see I can add a new

109
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:12,000
So I'm just going to use the same name for this user.

110
00:13:12,010 --> 00:13:18,730
It only lets me use 7 character so I'm missing the E on the end for the username and I'm going to type

111
00:13:24,430 --> 00:13:32,380
and type it again so that it knows that we are using the same password and I can click create a user

112
00:13:36,620 --> 00:13:38,210
could go back one more time.

113
00:13:38,390 --> 00:13:45,080
And now there's one more step I need to give this user permissions to use the certain database so if

114
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:01,320
and I want to click the all privileges button click make changes and now I've granted privileges to

115
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:11,000
So if I just clicked go back here and I can actually get right back to the see panel home.

116
00:14:11,010 --> 00:14:13,820
Now I know what those credentials were.

117
00:14:13,830 --> 00:14:20,340
So I can go back into my W.P. config file and enter them here.

118
00:14:20,380 --> 00:14:26,530
Now I've entered those three credentials and I know that when we're creating databases using the C panel

119
00:14:26,770 --> 00:14:30,320
we use localhost as the hostname.

120
00:14:30,370 --> 00:14:36,520
And so I can go up and click save at the top right and then I can just close that code editor and I

121
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:46,590
go ahead and close that.

122
00:14:46,750 --> 00:14:54,700
And inside of the C panel I can just grab my main domain and then hit control-C to copy open a new tab

123
00:14:57,940 --> 00:15:04,030
But I'm going to add the name of the folder that I created right at the end there and it looks like

124
00:15:08,170 --> 00:15:09,960
No worries this is very common.

125
00:15:09,970 --> 00:15:15,970
I can tell that WordPress is trying to see the database and so something is working.

126
00:15:19,510 --> 00:15:27,010
So let's look at the databases section of the C panel and it looks like it's Greg D 11 not Greg.

127
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,720
Very common error which may have happened to you as well.

128
00:15:43,870 --> 00:15:51,910
W.P. config Doppie HP and I'll go up and click the code editor and click Edit.

129
00:15:51,980 --> 00:15:59,160
Now as I look at the database credentials I can see that I'm just missing a number one here and a number

130
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:05,710
I'll just click save and then close and I can close the file manager now.

131
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:11,220
Now if I go back to this address and hit refresh great.

132
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:19,900
I can click continue and now I'll fill in my credentials and set up my wordpress site.

133
00:16:20,000 --> 00:16:22,180
I filled in all my credentials here.

134
00:16:22,190 --> 00:16:25,800
I used a password that I could easily remember which was a weak one.

135
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:28,620
So I had to click confirm use of weak password again.

136
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,300
But in my email address and I'll click install WordPress.

137
00:16:32,660 --> 00:16:34,520
I love that success message.

138
00:16:34,530 --> 00:16:38,680
I'll click log in just to go ahead and make sure everything is working.

139
00:16:38,970 --> 00:16:42,790
I think my is remembering my password.

140
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:45,290
It's one I often use and great.

141
00:16:52,070 --> 00:16:57,660
got a beautiful new WordPress installation that I installed manually.

142
00:16:57,910 --> 00:17:04,030
You can see that that takes quite a few more steps than it does to go into your C panel and use the

143
00:17:04,090 --> 00:17:06,270
Wordpress installer.

144
00:17:06,490 --> 00:17:12,290
But hopefully that gives you a good understanding of how WordPress works and connects to the database.

145
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:19,460
In this video you set up a new WordPress installation either on your local computer using map or your

146
