00:00:01,030 --> 00:00:06,700
In this video you'll make almost the same exact changes to a development site as you did in the last

2
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:13,120
But this time you'll let a plug in do the work will start from one of the migration copies of the previous

3
00:00:18,370 --> 00:00:23,370
You'll check out the plug in options in the Wordpress plugin repository for creating child themes.

4
00:00:23,440 --> 00:00:27,430
And use one of them to create the necessary files and configuration.

5
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:30,840
First to get started.

6
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:36,790
Open your local development environment like I have here and log into the Wordpress dashboard.

7
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:44,210
In the last local environment site that we worked on in my case it's called Live Dasch site.

8
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:50,780
This is the one we've got the affinity theme plugged into our original content that we edited within

9
00:00:51,050 --> 00:00:52,210
2014.

10
00:00:52,460 --> 00:00:58,730
And if you remember in the last video we edited the CSSA the style sheet to make these lines white in

11
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:13,750
under plug ins add new and I did a search for child theme.

12
00:01:19,030 --> 00:01:25,170
I can see it does have quite a few installs and is compatible with this version updated very recently.

13
00:01:25,180 --> 00:01:29,260
There are a couple more in here that I have used and get good reviews.

14
00:01:34,120 --> 00:01:41,380
Although it's been updated not so recently and says untested with this new version of Wordpress and

15
00:01:47,350 --> 00:01:48,970
and click Install now.

16
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:54,520
Now it doesn't start or click activate plug in.

17
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:01,280
Now that I have that activated I can look under Tools and child themes is where the settings are configured.

18
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:08,870
Before I do any change it's to create a child theme using the child theme configurator plug in.

19
00:02:09,130 --> 00:02:16,030
I want to go and make sure I look at what's happening now under appearance themes and label my original

20
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:21,680
child theme that I had created manually just so that I know which one it is.

21
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,710
The name of the theme is defined within the stylesheet and that's true of our child theme as well.

22
00:02:30,700 --> 00:02:36,220
Whichever theme that you have active you can just click editor and wordpress will navigate right to

23
00:02:38,610 --> 00:02:45,750
I can edit files within this WordPress file editor but it's best practice to bring them into your local

24
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:58,080
However just for this simple change I can label this affinity child one just so I know that's the one

25
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,590
that I updated manually and created the files for.

26
00:03:02,610 --> 00:03:08,790
And when that tells me the file was edited successfully I could go back to appearance themes and we'll

27
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:19,530
So that means that if I activate another theme say the original affinity theme.

28
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:27,760
Any changes that I made withinside that original child theme would be no longer valid.

29
00:03:34,150 --> 00:03:36,430
lines instead of white lines.

30
00:03:40,140 --> 00:03:46,530
So now let's use the plug in to create a new child theme and we'll make sure we label it affinity child

31
00:03:46,610 --> 00:03:49,170
2 or something where we can tell the difference.

32
00:03:50,810 --> 00:03:59,140
Go ahead and navigate to Tools child themes once again and let's get started making a child theme I'd

33
00:04:05,650 --> 00:04:10,370
to choose affinity and I'll click analyzed first.

34
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:21,180
The plugin gives me a message looks like it appears to be OK to use as a child theme.

35
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:24,540
And it loads additional stylesheets.

36
00:04:24,570 --> 00:04:30,840
So there are a couple of things that it recommends that I do.

37
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:36,510
If you look at the options here they are pretty straightforward and you can most likely leave the default

38
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:48,420
It did say that it loads additional stylesheets and I can choose to create a separate style sheet so

39
00:04:55,650 --> 00:05:01,350
And so I'm just going to leave it as the default primary style sheet and I'm going to use the word Press

40
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:02,100
style.

41
00:05:02,140 --> 00:05:02,590
Hugh

42
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,960
and I am going to go ahead and look at it wants to name it.

43
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:15,920
And actually if you look at the name of the folder it's going to use it already saw that I had an affinity

44
00:05:23,060 --> 00:05:25,100
We will call it affinity child.

45
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:32,300
Since I had a one in the last one and I can go ahead and use all these default settings that came from

46
00:05:38,180 --> 00:05:43,820
child theme so that all the settings if you have made settings to the menus and the widgets and customize

47
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,810
So create a new child theme.

48
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:50,610
Yes.

49
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:52,400
Great.

50
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:57,670
It says it's been generated successfully and it wants me to preview it before activating it.

51
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:08,230
and it opens the customize or previewing the child theme itself.

52
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:13,560
Looks normal I could add the footer.

53
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:30,310
And I think it's finished so I am going to come outside of the child theme configurator settings page

54
00:06:37,040 --> 00:06:43,680
And here it is affinity child too and with the plug in it's pretty nice that it puts the screen shot

55
00:06:43,700 --> 00:06:44,850
in there for you.

56
00:06:44,930 --> 00:06:51,430
But if I activate that child theme remember I previewed it which if you don't do that at first and you'd

57
00:06:58,510 --> 00:07:01,480
you can click live preview right at the bottom there.

58
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:03,150
Whoops.

59
00:07:03,220 --> 00:07:07,830
I'm just going to cancel that and leave 2015 inside of my folder.

60
00:07:07,990 --> 00:07:13,120
But now that I have the new theme activated I click click visit site or I do have the site open here

61
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:17,120
So I scroll back to the top and click refresh

62
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:24,230
remember it opens a different image at random.

63
00:07:29,040 --> 00:07:36,210
Remember this local site will still be the old style sheet and it also still says live there in the

64
00:07:43,080 --> 00:07:48,240
We changed that name so I'll just go in real quick to settings at my local site

65
00:07:51,930 --> 00:07:53,870
take it back to the normal name

66
00:07:59,220 --> 00:08:05,910
and now that we can see that child theme activated let's go look around and make that small edit inside

67
00:08:08,170 --> 00:08:11,480
So I'd like to pose a challenge to you at this point.

68
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:21,080
I want you to look at your theme files inside of the Wordpress directory and I'd like you to find your

69
00:08:29,510 --> 00:08:38,320
that we had used before in our manually installed child the stop the video now and give it a go well

70
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:47,890
I'm going to open the code editor that I had the other files open in and here's the footer widgets piece

71
00:08:49,810 --> 00:08:51,850
So I'm just going to copy that at first.

72
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:57,550
And inside my code editor I do have the whole file structure here and so I should be able to open W.P.

73
00:09:02,860 --> 00:09:09,490
Looks like I have them here it's the one labeled child too if you remember and it made the screen shot

74
00:09:14,260 --> 00:09:22,180
So if I open that one up all I have to do is go beyond the comment slash here and hit Control V to paste

75
00:09:23,080 --> 00:09:24,670
and I'll hit Control s.

76
00:09:24,820 --> 00:09:29,470
Now at that point if it were live I would have to upload this file to the server but since I can just

77
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:43,680
the page and see those footer title borders go to white instead of gray grade I've made a change.

78
00:09:52,830 --> 00:10:00,450
child to stylesheet file has my new code in there and I did that without using the word press code editor

79
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:08,670
but instead in my code editor on my local machine in this video you used a plugin to create the files

80
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:19,650
You also edited the style dot CSSA file on your own to change a color in the footer.

81
00:10:19,670 --> 00:10:20,780
Nice job.

82
00:10:20,810 --> 00:10:26,630
Next you'll edit the functions that BHP file inside your child theme to change something not on the

83
00:10:31,400 --> 00:10:31,840
Let's go
