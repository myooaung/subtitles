00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:06.290
In this video you'll add an interactive map to the website for a client that has a location.

2
00:00:06.580 --> 00:00:12.790
We'll use a Google Maps again to easily embed a map on the Contact page and in the footer content area

3
00:00:18.790 --> 00:00:22.300
them and you'll be able to set them up professionally with these techniques.

4
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:32.340
To embed a map on the Contact page what we'll do is put some contact information with the address that

5
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:45.230
And above the contact form so that it sits in here a nice interactive map of the location.

6
00:00:45.280 --> 00:00:51.790
So if we go to the dashboard and if the Google Maps plug in it's not already activated go ahead and

7
00:00:51.820 --> 00:01:01.220
activate it and then roll over maps and let's look at maps this Google Maps plug in allows you to have

8
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.750
But we only need one map on this.

9
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:19.060
So let's go ahead and open up the one called My first map and take a look at the settings

10
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.140
and the default settings are fine to leave for now.

11
00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:33.940
But it looks like we've got an indicator on this map that is California United States.

12
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:47.040
Put in a location with an address

13
00:01:49.610 --> 00:01:57.500
click add marker and then I can go down here and I can use the mouse to zoom in and pan around until

14
00:01:57.860 --> 00:02:04.900
I centered myself on the marker right where I want to be.

15
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:23.900
I want people to be able to find the location easily but also know where they are and be familiar with

16
00:02:26.940 --> 00:02:27.590
Great.

17
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:37.180
So as I've dragged the map around it's showing me the width at 100 percent for a responsive map and

18
00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.090
Let's save the map

19
00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:54.090
great you could see that it moved the zoom level to there that's where I had zoomed in.

20
00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:01.760
Now that I have that map I have my marker at 35 front street and it gives me a short code just like

21
00:03:04.060 --> 00:03:12.930
So if I copy the short code should be able to just open up the contact page and drop the map right in

22
00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:31.990
oh I'm excited let's open up the Web site contact page and once this is done loading I'll go ahead and

23
00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:39.490
Nice.

24
00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:43.130
So if I click on the marker it shows me the address.

25
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:51.210
It's an interactive map so I can zoom in and out I can locate the location.

26
00:03:51.220 --> 00:03:53.320
I can also use the mouse zoom in and out.

27
00:03:53.520 --> 00:04:00.540
And these are functions that you can either keep or limit using the plug in settings it's a little bit

28
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.660
form to set it apart just a little bit.

29
00:04:10.260 --> 00:04:13.780
And let's check the responsiveness to the screen size.

30
00:04:14.010 --> 00:04:20.940
If I drag this screen from the array a little bit and make it narrower I can watch the say and how it

31
00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:31.740
awesome.

32
00:04:31.790 --> 00:04:35.270
Go ahead and make that map for any address you like on your own.

33
00:04:45.110 --> 00:04:47.140
lay it out so that it looks good.

34
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:52.860
Puzzel video now and then I'll show you how I would do that.

35
00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:53.920
How do you do.

36
00:04:54.410 --> 00:05:00.170
Well if I were going to do that I would go back to the contact page and after the map but before the

37
00:05:11.610 --> 00:05:21.730
and then if you had shift enter it'll do a single line space instead of double line space.

38
00:05:21.930 --> 00:05:28.250
When actually put another space in there and then how about a horizontal line there.

39
00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:40.240
Now I'm going to go ahead and center that and make it larger.

40
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.500
Nice.

41
00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:46.220
And I probably should announce this contact for

42
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:00.270
an update.

43
00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:05.610
Nice

44
00:06:10.440 --> 00:06:10.970
okay.

45
00:06:10.980 --> 00:06:21.670
Now if we look at every page of the website there's a header there's a sidebar and there's two areas

46
00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:28.720
left and right that are located above the footer that you can use that are widget areas in the 2016

47
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:38.170
What I'd like to do now is put a Google map into one of the widget areas and the name address and phone

48
00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:47.050
Zagat on How'd that go.

49
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:49.170
Here's how I would do it.

50
00:06:49.180 --> 00:06:54.640
I'm going to go back to the contact page and just grab the address and phone number because I'll be

51
00:06:57.250 --> 00:07:04.240
And then when they do this using the custom Mizer so that I can see what it's looking like as I go now

52
00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:20.340
Let's go ahead and put a text widget into the content bottom one widget area.

53
00:07:20.430 --> 00:07:23.250
Title it.

54
00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:25.070
Find me.

55
00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:37.240
Now inside of widgets you can only put text you can style it with HDMI now but the HTL mail that came

56
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:45.670
page.

57
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:56.020
So it wasn't large if you remember this was heading to and it's centered so I could use some HVM l tags

58
00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:05.110
and close it with some tags and a slash in front of the command.

59
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:10.880
And if I have an entry here I can click automatically add paragraphs so it'll put a line break in.

60
00:08:11.050 --> 00:08:20.230
Where I where I have line breaks and let's see what it looks like if I put a heading to for the phone

61
00:08:30.010 --> 00:08:31.020
OK.

62
00:08:31.030 --> 00:08:32.780
Now this is going to be on the left side.

63
00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.590
If I use content bottom two because it's left and right.

64
00:08:38.260 --> 00:08:42.140
You know I think I'll use heading to for the address as well.

65
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.060
So I'll just check this heading to tag.

66
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:50.510
Cut it and pasted right there

67
00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.150
nice and hopefully that won't be too wide.

68
00:08:57.940 --> 00:09:06.030
You know what I could actually put a carriage return in there after Front Street.

69
00:09:06.140 --> 00:09:09.350
And I won't need the comma.

70
00:09:09.430 --> 00:09:09.880
There we go.

71
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:19.650
So if I have that on current can contact but I'm too for current applicants at bottom one rather in

72
00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:22.990
content bottom two loops.

73
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:35.370
I mean at one of my maps so the Google Maps plug in provides some widgets and it was the ID one that

74
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:42.590
I can have a title so that it matches

75
00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:50.350
nice and you could see it's responsive to the area of the widget.

76
00:09:50.510 --> 00:09:54.000
And then there's the address.

77
00:09:54.050 --> 00:10:02.390
So let's take a look at it say on the home page because those content areas at the footer of the Web

78
00:10:10.110 --> 00:10:14.860
So if somebody scroll to the bottom of any page of the website they'll be able to get the contact info

79
00:10:15.220 --> 00:10:18.870
and an interactive map if they like.

80
00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:21.710
So that's what the home page looks like.

81
00:10:22.030 --> 00:10:24.550
And so if we go to the About page

82
00:10:28.460 --> 00:10:32.120
great there is that footer area nicely done.

83
00:10:32.370 --> 00:10:38.160
Now something you may have noticed is that on the Contact page where we have our map embedded if you

84
00:10:45.540 --> 00:10:52.170
Also in terms of the plug in that we're using right here you're only allowed one map unless you upgrade

85
00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:59.820
So I've done a little research and I've moved over to this W.P. Google map plug in here by flipper code

86
00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:05.970
installed it and found it to be a little bit more user friendly and it has the ability to create more

87
00:11:12.400 --> 00:11:17.410
I've already installed and activated the plug in and I'll show you some of the differences and how I

88
00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:28.310
So you had a location separately from a map and then you can manage locations and manage maps.

89
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:33.470
The first thing I did was added a location with our address.

90
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:35.270
I called it fire weed photography.

91
00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:38.920
But if I go in and edit it you can see how this plugin works.

92
00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:47.060
And it also has a nice feature where you can display the info window message above the marker with whatever

93
00:11:52.430 --> 00:11:53.760
So that's what I placed here.

94
00:11:53.870 --> 00:11:59.220
I checked the info window the fall open box and then I saved my location.

95
00:11:59.570 --> 00:12:00.800
Then I added a map.

96
00:12:05.420 --> 00:12:06.460
across the map.

97
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:09.150
The same thing.

98
00:12:09.460 --> 00:12:11.090
And here are some of my settings.

99
00:12:11.110 --> 00:12:17.140
I did have to experiment a little bit and choose a zoom level between 1 and 19 by saving the map and

100
00:12:22.870 --> 00:12:27.610
on and I made the map the same amount of pixels high as we had before.

101
00:12:32.650 --> 00:12:35.680
it responsive to any screen size.

102
00:12:41.020 --> 00:12:49.780
But then I just save the map and once you save the map and you go to your managed maps page you can

103
00:12:55.940 --> 00:13:05.520
So I'm getting Control-C to copy that and then I'll go to the contact me page open it up and replace

104
00:13:08.520 --> 00:13:11.640
Now here's what the contact page looks like.

105
00:13:12.410 --> 00:13:18.790
You can see that I don't have a marker but if I click on it there's where I get my marker information

106
00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:26.350
and the map is zoom mobile as well as draggle.

107
00:13:26.420 --> 00:13:27.820
So let's replace the shortcut

108
00:13:31.410 --> 00:13:32.590
with the new one.

109
00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.240
Update the page and take a look as we refresh the contact me page

110
00:13:40.030 --> 00:13:46.120
nice that looks a lot better to me it already has the info graphic up there.

111
00:13:52.860 --> 00:13:56.910
And now the old map is now able to be embedded down here.

112
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.260
will be useful here.

113
00:14:10.590 --> 00:14:11.360
looks good.

114
00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:26.190
So let's go back and create a new map under WP Google map.

115
00:14:26.390 --> 00:14:27.560
This one I'm going to call

116
00:14:30.830 --> 00:14:36.570
fire weed footer so I can differentiate it 100 percent with this time.

117
00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:39.430
I'm going to make it 200 pixels in height.

118
00:14:39.740 --> 00:14:41.580
Let's go to the same zoom level

119
00:14:45.710 --> 00:14:50.120
and I'm actually going to use the same location on this map.

120
00:14:54.550 --> 00:15:02.250
And now all I have to do is go to manage my maps and find the short code for this one which I called

121
00:15:06.540 --> 00:15:17.050
Copy that and then paste it into the widget area this time other appearance widgets will look at content

122
00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:28.310
Now if you remember I dragged in the WP Google map right here and I'm going to go ahead and just drag

123
00:15:38.590 --> 00:15:41.530
And I mean to select the fire we'd foot or map

124
00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.480
title that map and click save in the widget.

125
00:15:48.270 --> 00:15:49.800
Let's go back and refresh the page

126
00:15:53.300 --> 00:15:54.350
nice.

127
00:15:54.410 --> 00:16:03.830
That looks much better and we can display both maps on the same page and review if I click about the

128
00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:10.830
And now I think it's laid out just a little bit better.

129
00:16:12.270 --> 00:16:17.430
The last thing I'm going to do is go ahead and keep my word press installation clean by going back into

130
00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.000
Install plug ins deactivating and then deleting that plug in.

131
00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:27.520
Let's see it's W.P. Google Maps.

132
00:16:27.730 --> 00:16:30.350
Not by flipper code but by W.P. Google Maps.

133
00:16:38.480 --> 00:16:44.500
Once you delete inside the Wordpress dashboard it'll give you a confirmation message.

134
00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.040
Yes delete these files.

135
00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:52.340
Great.

136
00:16:54.840 --> 00:16:59.940
And we've inserted some nice maps into our website.

137
00:17:00.150 --> 00:17:06.900
In this video you've configured a Google map to display an interactive location map to visitors of the

138
00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:15.080
information.

139
00:17:16.080 --> 00:17:21.420
In the next video we'll set up the Google Analytics plug in to begin tracking activity on the Web site

140
00:17:21.690 --> 00:17:24.070
and also to display the stats on the dashboard.
