00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:04,620
In this chapter you'll set up several different hosting and development environments for building your

2
00:00:06,090 --> 00:00:11,520
This video will introduce you to all the types of hosting and development systems including shared hosting

3
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:17,940
dedicated servers and cloud hosting managed WordPress hosting and local development environments.

4
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:26,270
as well as several different ways of building WordPress locally.

5
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:28,680
Without an internet connection let's get started.

6
00:00:30,020 --> 00:00:35,990
Shared hosting is an inexpensive way to get started with web site hosting its advantages in price but

7
00:00:41,900 --> 00:00:48,470
are sharing resources shared hosting means that if one site starts using all the available memory storage

8
00:00:54,650 --> 00:00:56,300
going down for a period of time.

9
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:02,890
Modern hosting companies have protocols in place like site monitoring resource limit warnings and other

10
00:01:05,950 --> 00:01:10,690
So shared hosting programs are a good place to start to keep a development environment that will not

11
00:01:18,310 --> 00:01:19,640
and file size.

12
00:01:19,660 --> 00:01:24,570
It may be smart to move to another type of hosting account and will get into migrating WordPress Web

13
00:01:28,120 --> 00:01:34,870
Some examples of popular and tested shared hosting environments are Rob Percival's own eco web hosting

14
00:01:36,110 --> 00:01:40,800
site grounds WordPress specific shared hosting programs.

15
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,650
If you're getting started these companies can offer you a space to build multiple Web sites and take

16
00:01:49,050 --> 00:01:53,920
Most of the hosting companies offer an upgrade from shared hosting splitting off the server space into

17
00:01:53,940 --> 00:01:59,530
private hosting areas called Dedicated or private servers.

18
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:03,630
There's a middle ground which is very effective at separating web sites from each other but doesn't

19
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,610
the hosting company has partitioned the hardware and disk space that holds the website hosting areas

20
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:24,740
into separate spaces so that each hosting space can't affect the others on the same master server to

21
00:02:26,960 --> 00:02:31,580
There's effectively no difference between a dedicated server and a virtual private server.

22
00:02:39,410 --> 00:02:44,840
stretch and grow instead of losing speed or going down in the event of a traffic spike or a need for

23
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:51,000
Cloud hosting is a good way to provide hosting for a group of clients in one place.

24
00:02:51,160 --> 00:02:58,060
As a web site designer in my business I use site grounds cloud hosting program so I can host and take

25
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:04,470
if they need it.

26
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,930
A control panel and pay one inexpensive price for the package.

27
00:03:09,190 --> 00:03:14,290
It lets We charge a monthly or yearly fee for web site hosting and maintenance without having to work

28
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:17,470
with a lot of different hosts that my clients have chosen.

29
00:03:17,650 --> 00:03:22,390
My hosting and Web site maintenance and care plans are what let me achieve a level of recurring income

30
00:03:30,170 --> 00:03:38,050
sandbox hosting account at site Ground specially made for W.P. of course students at the students W.P.

31
00:03:38,210 --> 00:03:41,230
of course dot com website down at their site.

32
00:03:48,020 --> 00:03:55,350
free hosting so that you can set up sites and work on them in the site ground environment another level

33
00:04:01,020 --> 00:04:07,190
the popularity of Wordpress grow and are filling a need for designers and developers managed WordPress

34
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,450
hosting is a server setup that has additional thought built into the server architecture and layers

35
00:04:19,260 --> 00:04:19,970
needs.

36
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:25,670
Manage hosting programs usually have a caching layer to drastically speed up the loading of Wordpress

37
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:36,370
Managed WordPress hosting companies also optimize the hardware and server programs for the way WordPress

38
00:04:38,890 --> 00:04:43,130
This is a little more expensive to use but there are a lot of advantages.

39
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:50,020
I use flywheel WordPress hosting for my own sites and client sites who expect to have more traffic where

40
00:04:52,600 --> 00:05:00,310
Flywheel is offering WP dev course students a special deal on a free development environment for working

41
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:14,500
Again the link to flywheel will open up a free 60 day trial where you can develop a site on the fly

42
00:05:17,260 --> 00:05:21,230
Course students will be setting that up in this chapter.

43
00:05:22,190 --> 00:05:28,070
Cloud ways is an interesting company as well and I use them for spinning up sites quickly for development

44
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,020
and very inexpensive hosting.

45
00:05:31,160 --> 00:05:37,010
They might be considered a hybrid between cloud hosting and managed hosting because you can easily install

46
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,460
But as far as security and a firewall for hacking attempts and traffic filtration it's more of a manual

47
00:05:48,200 --> 00:05:53,180
I found that I have to be diligent with sites hosted at cloud ways because they are more exposed to

48
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:03,170
The fully managed hosting companies provide a firewall between you and these potential attacks.

49
00:06:03,650 --> 00:06:08,570
You can do your own research to find which hosting company fits your vision for your business online

50
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:10,380
and reviews signal.

51
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:15,490
Dot Com has a lot of independent reviews and comparisons.

52
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:21,380
There is a WordPress hosting benchmarks test article that they've written for a few years in a row and

53
00:06:28,100 --> 00:06:29,960
use for your particular business.

54
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:31,800
Are other important considerations.

55
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:36,850
So review sites like this one are an important part of choosing a website hosting company.

56
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:43,970
The resource pages at WP dev course dot com and here in this course have special student discounts and

57
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:46,900
updated recommendations based on my experience.

58
00:06:46,970 --> 00:06:50,440
So be sure and check those out.

59
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:57,710
We took a tour in the last chapter of map available at map that info and how you can use it to set up

60
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:06,740
There are some other options as well that make it easy to set up Wordpress and play with it locally

61
00:07:07,100 --> 00:07:09,920
or without having to be connected to the Internet.

62
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:15,410
Each one of these options builds a server on your local computer just like map and they're all pretty

63
00:07:21,010 --> 00:07:28,530
Am P-P and it works exactly the same way as map but it was originally designed for Windows while map

64
00:07:28,550 --> 00:07:30,410
was originally for the Mac platform.

65
00:07:34,070 --> 00:07:41,780
It's available here at Apache friends dot work desktop server is a program that can set up local environments

66
00:07:45,990 --> 00:07:52,100
Another option is called Instant WordPress designed to set up WordPress local environments exclusively

67
00:07:52,460 --> 00:07:56,450
and available at instant W.P. dot com.

68
00:07:56,630 --> 00:08:01,970
I'll be teaching how to install a map for a local environment and will also be signing up for a free

69
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:17,910
In this video we explored hosting options and development environments from shared hosting to cloud

70
00:08:20,790 --> 00:08:23,960
There are options for every purpose in your business.

71
00:08:23,970 --> 00:08:28,740
We also looked at options for easily setting up local development environments for staging building

72
00:08:34,650 --> 00:08:37,370
in the next few videos you'll set up your own systems.

73
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:41,890
Many of these hosting environments as well as set up your own local development environment.

74
00:08:41,910 --> 00:08:42,510
Here we go
