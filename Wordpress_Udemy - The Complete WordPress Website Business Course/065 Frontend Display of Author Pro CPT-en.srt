1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:06,410
In this video we'll check out all the stuff that comes with the author pro custom post type plug from

2
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:16,810
in comes ready to organize and display customized information.

3
00:00:16,850 --> 00:00:22,980
You'll see that by using the author pro plugin which works with any HDMI L5 Genesis theme.

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:29,730
It can save you a lot of work trying to get that custom post type information to display nicely.

5
00:00:29,740 --> 00:00:36,250
Let's start by looking at the Genesis author pro plug in page inside of Wordpress dot org.

6
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:45,810
it's called Genesis author Pro.

7
00:00:45,820 --> 00:00:51,310
You can open this up and look at the plug in in more detail if you like but I'm just going to show you

8
00:00:56,620 --> 00:01:03,090
One of the things we have is that there are a there's a library created when you activate this plugin

9
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:09,970
that uses custom post types for information that is covered in all of these bullet points.

10
00:01:10,330 --> 00:01:16,360
So there's all these free set up custom fields where you can place information that gets stored in the

11
00:01:22,030 --> 00:01:25,720
There's a little bit more to this custom post types.

12
00:01:25,730 --> 00:01:35,910
Plug in there's output from a widget a featured book widget that comes within the Wordpress dashboard

13
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:46,140
Once you activate the author pro plugin now within the featured book widget it's very much like the

14
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:59,340
pro-team inside of Genesis and it gives you a lot of options with which to display the different custom

15
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,400
As you scroll down there's also some fields designed for authors who can have multiple authors within

16
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:23,940
of these are independent of a WordPress user as an author and it's independent of the date that a post

17
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:32,960
So it's a published date that's independent of that.

18
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:39,840
Finally there are these five templates built into the plugin and this is where the Genesis author pro

19
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:47,290
plugin gets really powerful and prevent you from having to program templates like this yourself while

20
00:02:47,310 --> 00:02:50,110
using something like the custom press plugin.

21
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:57,720
You can list a single book page a list of books which is an archive page and you can list the books

22
00:03:06,120 --> 00:03:11,390
of these taxonomies is independent of the categories and tags.

23
00:03:11,460 --> 00:03:14,120
Taxonomies built into WordPress.

24
00:03:14,220 --> 00:03:24,330
Now it should be mentioned that this author pro plugin works with any Agena HCM L5 Genesis child theme.

25
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:30,150
Any studio press theme that has the word pro in it like Author pro and all the themes that are present

26
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:38,190
within the student's sandbox are HVM L5 themes so you'll see that the author pro plugin will work with

27
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:50,310
And one last thing because we're in wordpress dot org you can see that this Genesis author Pro is a

28
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:57,850
However it only works with a theme that's running.

29
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:06,470
Genesis back inside the Wordpress dashboard in the author pro sandbox site that you've set up.

30
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,630
Let's take a look at the Customize her.

31
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:12,980
What will be doing is looking through the author pro theme.

32
00:04:13,050 --> 00:04:19,860
After making this content import that we've done and will look at all the different pages and custom

33
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:29,660
themes to display the content.

34
00:04:30,180 --> 00:04:36,660
As we've seen before the home page doesn't look exactly the same or as it should because I had it set

35
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,840
of course dotcom students sandbox area will deal with this home page later but for now let's open up

36
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:53,140
menus.

37
00:04:54,110 --> 00:04:57,730
And you can see that there's three menus created already.

38
00:04:57,760 --> 00:05:05,140
Follow me is a menu that came in with our SML import and has some social networking follow buttons Hetter

39
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:22,090
However these items here menu one menu to three and dropdown are the ones that I had but by importing

40
00:05:29,140 --> 00:05:35,810
of these navigation items that we can use to check out the author pro plug in content and how it's played.

41
00:05:35,920 --> 00:05:37,800
So we'll be using that hetter menu.

42
00:05:38,020 --> 00:05:45,280
And then there's also a secondary menu that appears within the author profe theme and is control with

43
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,850
That shows I'm a book author page and some book tag pages.

44
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:03,570
menu location and under secondary navigation menu location.

45
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:13,160
Let's set a secondary menu great so now what we have is a set of menus one across the top and another

46
00:06:21,340 --> 00:06:28,690
Now I'd like you to make one more change so that this hetter menu isn't so large it has too many items.

47
00:06:35,590 --> 00:06:39,670
to go ahead and remove menu one two and three.

48
00:06:40,840 --> 00:06:49,180
Go ahead and follow along and do the same as well as the dropdown menu item and then items 1 2 and 3

49
00:06:49,540 --> 00:06:58,270
that I had created when you created your sandbox at first and we have the standard Hetter menu that

50
00:07:05,770 --> 00:07:08,190
So now click save and publish.

51
00:07:08,770 --> 00:07:14,710
And now I'm ready to close the customize or I'll get back to the Wordpress dashboard here and I'll just

52
00:07:15,700 --> 00:07:18,520
Visit site right click and click.

53
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:27,640
I still have my old front page and will be editing later in this chapter.

54
00:07:27,760 --> 00:07:36,640
But I do have my menu items secondary menu right here and the header menu which has a few different

55
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:52,500
custom fields and custom taxonomies that are available here within the author pro theme and plug in

56
00:07:53,050 --> 00:07:57,340
most of them are available under sample page with the dropdown right here.

57
00:08:03,550 --> 00:08:10,780
like a traditional post it's got a title it's got an author listed here which is not actually the user

58
00:08:11,650 --> 00:08:16,660
within WordPress but actually an author listed as the author taxonomy.

59
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:19,500
There is an image on the right hand side.

60
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:25,480
And we'll talk about how this image looks like a book with this little bit of overlay on the left side

61
00:08:26,290 --> 00:08:30,700
and it's got some information in the body text area down on the left side.

62
00:08:30,850 --> 00:08:33,880
And then here are some of the custom fields over here on the right.

63
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:39,840
There's a price and then there's a publisher how the item is available.

64
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:45,970
There's an is vin number custom fields and there's two buttons that you can use for any link and there's

65
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:59,470
It's also got a tagged listing right here for any book tags that are associated with this particular

66
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:06,400
Now let's go back into the Wordpress dashboard and under our new custom post type area code library

67
00:09:06,620 --> 00:09:12,070
lets look at all books and we'll open that same book it's called across the bridge.

68
00:09:13,150 --> 00:09:18,000
And let's see how this is different from a traditional post within WordPress.

69
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:19,320
It looks very similar.

70
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:27,250
It's got your traditional editing area here at the top the ADD media button etc. and you can see that

71
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:41,350
the title or name of the book itself as we scroll down a little bit you can see some of the taxonomies

72
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:48,040
on the right hand side book authors is set up like categories in a traditional WordPress post.

73
00:09:54,580 --> 00:09:58,670
So it's like each book can have two different types of categories.

74
00:09:58,690 --> 00:10:02,550
One is for authors and one is for a book series.

75
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,190
And then finally there's a nonhierarchical taxonomy like tags.

76
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:14,650
And this one is called Book tags and it's independent from the tags that are available under posts because

77
00:10:14,710 --> 00:10:19,800
it's set up separately inside of the custom post type called books.

78
00:10:20,140 --> 00:10:26,110
As we scroll down a little bit lower There's the traditional featured image and it's designed to be

79
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:32,560
It places it on the right hand side.

80
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:39,150
And it also has a certain size and a certain thumbnail image size associated with it.

81
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:44,990
Back to the Wordpress dashboard as we scroll down we've got a few more items.

82
00:10:45,000 --> 00:10:49,930
Now these are all the custom fields under book details.

83
00:10:50,010 --> 00:10:57,310
There are a whole bunch of custom fields that we can use feature text is interesting.

84
00:10:57,390 --> 00:11:06,060
What if I say that let's see this one is featured text and if I update that now there was nothing within

85
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:21,090
the bridge it shows featured text as kind of a banner across the right hand side in an angle that lists

86
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:29,630
An interesting display of a custom field inside of wordpress.

87
00:11:29,650 --> 00:11:36,490
Now further down like we listed on the book page here we've got price is bin number publisher.

88
00:11:42,510 --> 00:11:49,830
There is a publication date that can be listed available in certain types of formats right here.

89
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:54,280
And then a place where you can have three up to three different buttons.

90
00:12:00,490 --> 00:12:06,790
two buttons one for Abai on Amazon and one to download the e-book can point these wherever you like

91
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:13,870
to have the customer go ahead and link through to either the publisher or Amazon or wherever they can

92
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,580
Well that shows us within the book custom post-time a lot of the stuff that's built into the Author

93
00:12:28,600 --> 00:12:31,500
good on any Genesis powered theme.

94
00:12:32,750 --> 00:12:35,500
Now there's just a couple more things to look at here.

95
00:12:35,510 --> 00:12:39,950
Let's look at what a series page might look like.

96
00:12:40,130 --> 00:12:49,400
Now within the travel series you can see that the URL is the the the L slash series slash travel which

97
00:12:52,070 --> 00:13:00,520
We've got a three wide way of displaying a grid so that it's a nice display in and it shows the featured

98
00:13:00,530 --> 00:13:05,760
image the title which both are clickable through to the single book page.

99
00:13:05,930 --> 00:13:10,610
You can see that this one has that feature text says Award-Winning on it.

100
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:16,670
If I hit back we're on a series page which is like an archive page here.

101
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:22,760
Now you might be able to put some information at the top to announce that this is actually the travel

102
00:13:28,640 --> 00:13:32,330
Let's look at that option quickly inside the Wordpress dashboard.

103
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:39,830
If we look under series I've clicked the series menu item and I have one series in here so far called

104
00:13:40,970 --> 00:13:48,500
And when you click that the author pro plugin has provided us with a book series archive settings section

105
00:13:48,920 --> 00:13:58,190
which gives you an opportunity to place a title as well as the archive intro text above that grid format

106
00:13:59,840 --> 00:14:09,350
So if I just turn a travel travel series and then anything I might put in here you can put images anything

107
00:14:11,330 --> 00:14:13,060
You could put right here.

108
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:18,590
So I'm just going to put a placeholder word called content scroll that about to the bottom and click

109
00:14:18,650 --> 00:14:22,180
update and then look at this travel page.

110
00:14:22,490 --> 00:14:27,530
And this is the real advantage of using the author pro plug in with Genesis themes.

111
00:14:27,590 --> 00:14:35,300
You can place anything you like up top here on any archive page for example on an author page you can

112
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:51,980
Let's go back and look at tag's which is one of the taxonomies inside of the library or books custom

113
00:14:53,120 --> 00:15:00,650
If you have say Award-Winning there's one book inside of the award winning tag.

114
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:07,880
There is a tag archive's settings section where you can have a headline and whatever text or images

115
00:15:08,690 --> 00:15:12,680
Above all the items that fall under that tag.

116
00:15:12,740 --> 00:15:19,700
Now having these archive page settings areas where you can have a headline and some intro text or even

117
00:15:27,110 --> 00:15:36,950
This is unique to Genesys or at least it differs from the standard WordPress way that they treat taxonomies.

118
00:15:45,890 --> 00:15:47,050
powered theme.

119
00:15:47,150 --> 00:15:55,520
And if I go under posts and look at tags for example and choose one of my tags you'll see that it only

120
00:16:02,870 --> 00:16:09,110
your theme but you don't have an archive page setting a place where you can put intro text or anything

121
00:16:09,140 --> 00:16:10,340
else.

122
00:16:10,370 --> 00:16:16,430
The last thing I'd like to show you has to do with menu items here in the author pro theme as well as

123
00:16:21,710 --> 00:16:28,550
hand programmed into templates if you were to use a simpler custom post type plug in in the secondary

124
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:34,850
Here we have traditional items that are floated left but then a special highlighted item that you can

125
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:46,790
I have the appearance menus area open and I also have the secondary menu selected here so that we can

126
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:58,610
I don't see any differences here but if we look at the top we open up screen options we can see that

127
00:16:58,950 --> 00:17:08,240
we can check CSSA classes and that gives us an additional option for our menu items now built into this

128
00:17:08,330 --> 00:17:10,580
author pro theme.

129
00:17:16,430 --> 00:17:21,980
You just put the word highlight there and it will float that menu item to the right and it will highlight

130
00:17:26,780 --> 00:17:34,520
And the last thing is that for menu items you can see that there's not just Pages posts and categories

131
00:17:34,550 --> 00:17:40,970
as in and custom links as well that a traditional standard WordPress installation has.

132
00:17:41,090 --> 00:17:46,500
But we also have lots of different menu items provided by the custom post type plug in.

133
00:17:46,520 --> 00:17:48,100
We have libraries.

134
00:17:48,110 --> 00:17:53,090
You can make a menu item out of any of the book custom post type items.

135
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:01,280
We also have book authors book series and book tags that we can make menu items with and that makes

136
00:18:09,230 --> 00:18:16,460
the author pro theme or with any studio press Genesys theme that's using the author pro custom post

137
00:18:20,020 --> 00:18:25,870
You explored the author pro theme within your sandbox site powered by the author pro Plug-In with content

138
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:34,760
You can see that the custom post-time taxonomies and custom fields provided by the author pro plug in

139
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,060
gives Genesis themes easy display of all that custom content.

140
00:18:39,490 --> 00:18:45,100
In the next lesson we'll build out the home page of the site by using the author pro layout configuration
