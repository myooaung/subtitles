00:00:00,790 --> 00:00:06,900
In this video I'll introduce you to marketing email systems the MailChimp marketing email service and

2
00:00:06,910 --> 00:00:12,550
email auto responders marketing e-mail is different than transactional email in that it's initiated

3
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,890
And it's sometimes called bulk e-mail because it generally involves sending the same exact e-mail to

4
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:32,140
A good example is an e-mail newsletter that goes out periodically to a list of subscribers and the list

5
00:00:36,070 --> 00:00:41,230
By the end of this lesson you'll have a marketing email service at MailChimp and you'll understand marketing

6
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,990
Let's start by checking out the MailChimp bulk e-mail or marketing e-mail service.

7
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,260
Go to the resources page from your Wordpress dashboard at the student's sandbox or just navigate to

8
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,740
WP of course dot com and click resources near the bottom.

9
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:05,160
There's graphics and miscellaneous and there's a link right to MailChimp.

10
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:12,750
There are a few other services but MailChimp is excellent because it allows you to have a list of up

11
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:24,120
They begin charging you above 2000 subscribers but this is a great way for starting up inexpensively

12
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:29,220
or starting your clients out without having to pay for an e-mail service.

13
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:41,570
There are a lot of third party services that work with Wordpress and MailChimp and it's very very powerful.

14
00:01:41,590 --> 00:01:48,540
They're well known in the industry for being able to successfully send and securely send bulk emails

15
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:56,910
to lists as large as thousands tens of thousands even millions of subscribers at a time on the MailChimp

16
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:09,910
All you need is to choose a valid email address which you'll need to open an email they send you and

17
00:02:17,480 --> 00:02:24,650
sign up and log in will direct you to set up the proper address and email fields so that you can comply

18
00:02:31,340 --> 00:02:37,160
Once you've created your account you'll be able to create different lists and you can use multiple lists

19
00:02:37,190 --> 00:02:43,640
within your MailChimp account and you can even create sub lists called segment's or groups within a

20
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:53,370
So a list in MailChimp is just a single series of email addresses and possibly other information like

21
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:05,550
addresses so that you can send particular emails to that group or that list all at once.

22
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:20,490
images and logos inside of those templates campaigns in MailChimp are single emails that have gone out

23
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:27,440
or you're making to go out to a single list so once you've got all your account information set up within

24
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:38,360
You can navigate to the lists page and then at the top right click Create a list and then create a name

25
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,020
Now once you have a list created click on the name of that list so that it opens itself into a page

26
00:03:45,260 --> 00:03:50,890
and let's go over what the different tabs are across the top here and take a look at what they do.

27
00:03:50,900 --> 00:03:55,900
First of all you can look at the stats of course for people that are signing up for your list.

28
00:03:55,910 --> 00:04:01,760
And when you can manage the subscribers in some different ways like you can unsubscribe multiple addresses

29
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:13,890
adding subscribers is not something we do because we're working with wordpress Web sites.

30
00:04:14,030 --> 00:04:21,050
But you can add UPSs subscriber manually or if you already have a list you can import subscribers using

31
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:29,370
a CXXVI file or an Excel spreadsheet file to get those names and e-mails onto your MailChimp list the

32
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:42,330
signed up the place that I use mostly is the sign up forms button.

33
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:49,450
Go ahead and click the sign up forms button and there's four different types of sign up form areas that

34
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,600
One is general forms where you build and design your forms adding or subtracting fields for collecting

35
00:05:00,070 --> 00:05:06,270
And this is also where you would define and edit your response emails.

36
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,470
This is the first place we're going to check out with MailChimp in this video.

37
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:16,540
But just to go over what the rest of the areas are inside of Sign-Up forms this embedded forms area

38
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:23,700
is where you would generate some code to embed into your web site to collect Sign-Up so sign up form.

39
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:29,110
You can get from MailChimp and you get a little bit of code and you can manually place that in your

40
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:37,510
We'll do that in the next video a subscriber pop up is very similar to an embedded form.

41
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:45,130
But as you can probably surmise it pops up in front of the Web site at a prescribed time and a form

42
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:57,730
can say that oh if a pop up comes up in front of someone and whether they join it or whether they close

43
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:08,850
And then finally there's some form integrations that MailChimp provides and you can then use forms on

44
00:06:11,990 --> 00:06:18,420
I generally don't use those but I really use the general forms to create forms and response emails and

45
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:28,590
Let's click general forms to get a look at how we create the fields for our forms for signing up for

46
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:36,510
of MailChimp.

47
00:06:36,690 --> 00:06:43,590
We can control both the forms that users will use to subscribe to the e-mail lists as well as the response

48
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:53,680
the commercial e-mail spam laws.

49
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:59,580
We call those auto response e-mails because they are e-mails that are generated automatically when the

50
00:07:07,980 --> 00:07:11,080
to send them e-mails in the future.

51
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:19,050
It's always a very good idea to use what's called a double opt in system where the person first fills

52
00:07:26,010 --> 00:07:31,240
If they don't click confirm in the e-mail address they won't join the email list.

53
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:38,280
But if they do then the website owner or the e mailing list owner knows that they've given express permission

54
00:07:38,490 --> 00:07:40,510
to send them e-mails.

55
00:07:40,650 --> 00:07:47,160
Also MailChimp provides a link at the bottom of every e-mail that's required by law which is an unsubscribe

56
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:58,920
The other thing that's required by law is to have an the name of a business and an actual address.

57
00:07:59,010 --> 00:08:04,890
In each commercial e-mail that gets sent are each bulk e-mail that gets sent to the user.

58
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:11,940
In doing this MailChimp keeps their email servers clean from fraud or from illegal activities and it

59
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:26,610
a little bit you can see that there is a default sign up form that's right here and on the right side

60
00:08:26,790 --> 00:08:30,030
you can see you can use these buttons to add fields to it.

61
00:08:30,060 --> 00:08:36,240
You can click on any of these fields and you can see that there's a plus or minus to add a field or

62
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:39,570
get rid of this field right here.

63
00:08:44,610 --> 00:08:47,020
content and put anything you like in there.

64
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:50,490
Which would be a message at the top of your form.

65
00:08:50,710 --> 00:08:56,950
And we don't always use these actual forms and have them designed this way later on in a future video.

66
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:06,890
even though you have forms styled a certain way with MailChimp.

67
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:13,000
But for now let's go back up and finish this video by looking at the drop down here under where it says

68
00:09:15,820 --> 00:09:22,300
If you click the arrow on the right hand side you can see there are a whole bunch of different forms

69
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:30,120
managing.

70
00:09:30,130 --> 00:09:34,220
The first thing we'll look at is a sign up thank you page.

71
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,730
Let's just take a look at that.

72
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,460
Now it does look like the form that we filled out but instead of fields to fill out all it has is some

73
00:09:46,840 --> 00:09:52,330
So the thank you page just tells the user that to complete the subscription process you need to click

74
00:09:55,660 --> 00:10:02,470
So if I go back up and I open up the dropdown again the next thing is the opt in confirmation email

75
00:10:03,700 --> 00:10:05,760
we can edit this content.

76
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:12,610
And now this is a web page but this is an email that goes out to the user that subscribed to a list

77
00:10:13,810 --> 00:10:17,070
It says Please confirm subscription and of course you can edit that.

78
00:10:17,260 --> 00:10:23,350
And it's there's a button that says yes subscribe me to this list and there's some other text that you

79
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:32,980
Now the next step would be if they click the button in the confirmation email they would go to a confirmation.

80
00:10:33,010 --> 00:10:36,270
Thank you page.

81
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:45,150
you can edit the content just a little bit.

82
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,760
You can put a link to a PBF download or something like that.

83
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:56,670
Or you can send them to a particular web you Arel at your Web site and you can provide whatever information

84
00:10:56,970 --> 00:10:58,200
that's there.

85
00:10:58,530 --> 00:11:05,240
We'll be making Thank you pages and customizing our optin e-mails in the next video.

86
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:08,520
So when they go to the thank you page.

87
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:11,360
There's one more item that always comes in.

88
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:12,550
If you choose to.

89
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:18,510
And once they confirm and go to the thank you page you might want to send them a final welcome email

90
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:23,240
and you can uncheck this box so that they don't get a final welcome email.

91
00:11:23,370 --> 00:11:29,880
But if you have it checked and the user will get a final welcome email in addition to the opt in confirmation

92
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:38,410
a link to the download.

93
00:11:38,450 --> 00:11:44,280
It also by law has to tell them what they signed up for and you can see that it provides the unsubscribe

94
00:11:52,380 --> 00:11:56,150
them on our WordPress Web site.

95
00:11:56,240 --> 00:12:00,610
In this lesson you set up a free account at MailChimp for sending marketing e-mails.

96
00:12:00,620 --> 00:12:05,240
Otherwise known as bulk e-mail and you created a list within your MailChimp account.

97
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:10,660
You also checked out the Sign-Up up form system MailChimp provides and the auto responder e-mails that

98
00:12:10,670 --> 00:12:16,610
get sent to provide a double often system to get permission from subscribers to send them e-mails in

99
00:12:22,860 --> 00:12:29,440
site and explore the thank you pages and in emails that MailChimp uses as a part of the sign up process.

100
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:30,050
Let's go
