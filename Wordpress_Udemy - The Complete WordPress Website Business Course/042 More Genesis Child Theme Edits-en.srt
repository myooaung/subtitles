00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:06,520
In this video we'll continue editing the parallax pro-child theme in the Genesis framework while making

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:12,520
We'll try to preserve the integrity of the child theme by not editing the files as we did before with

3
00:00:19,270 --> 00:00:24,150
frameworks like Genesys use child themes to connect their extra functions to working themes.

4
00:00:24,340 --> 00:00:30,430
You can't create your own child theme to hold your code at its will learn how to edit the C S S without

5
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:41,590
Let's start by looking at the sample page and talk about how this Genesys theme provides a CSSA class

6
00:00:50,380 --> 00:00:58,000
of your sandbox site at W.P. of course dot com and go to pages all pages and then let's look at that

7
00:01:02,080 --> 00:01:03,270
within the sample page.

8
00:01:09,430 --> 00:01:11,980
But it's a nice imitation of it.

9
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:18,840
If you look at any of the images you can click one and click the little pencil edit button and it doesn't

10
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,690
Anything is different.

11
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:25,730
We have a medium sized defined with no link.

12
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:32,850
But if you open the Advanced Options dropdown you'll see that there is an image CSSA class here called

13
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:34,850
pull left.

14
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:41,970
If I remove that class and update the image and then update the page it doesn't change very much inside

15
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:53,520
it doesn't pull the image outside of the border like it does with these others but instead places it

16
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:58,100
in line to the column with next.

17
00:01:58,220 --> 00:02:04,570
Let's go down to the footer and this footer area which is present on every page of the website.

18
00:02:04,580 --> 00:02:14,660
Like I said is a Genesis standard will use a plugin to access the content on this footer and easily

19
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:15,550
change it.

20
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:20,420
So go back to the dashboard and click plugins.

21
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:27,700
There's a large assortment of plug ins available to you that will be using to customize and experiment

22
00:02:27,940 --> 00:02:30,400
with premium themes and plug ins.

23
00:02:30,550 --> 00:02:33,640
But I want you to go down and find Genesis.

24
00:02:33,670 --> 00:02:43,030
Simple edits just click activate now this plugin is designed for sites that are using Genesys framework

25
00:02:49,480 --> 00:02:50,520
repository.

26
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:55,210
This is a freely available plug in but it is only designed for Genesys sites.

27
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:02,960
Now that we have it activated under the Genesis menu there is a simple edits button under simple edits

28
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:10,680
you could see that it's got an area to edit the Mehta which is above and below the title on post and

29
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:15,340
the footer credits text is also editable here.

30
00:03:15,630 --> 00:03:23,610
If I want to get rid of the child theme link and the Genesis link because I'm customizing this for a

31
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:34,550
client I might take out the Wordpress link as well but leave the footer log in and log out button since

32
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:45,980
I'll usually put the name of the business and let's just use the name of the site that I'm using here.

33
00:03:46,340 --> 00:03:57,420
Right after the copyright save settings and let's go back and refresh the page the footer is available

34
00:03:59,520 --> 00:04:01,540
That would be the name of the business.

35
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:06,600
And then there is a log in and a log out button which can be a convenience for clients that want to

36
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:15,270
Back in the dashboard.

37
00:04:15,460 --> 00:04:22,090
Let's open the Customize again and look at some of the extras that Genesis themes and particularly the

38
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,740
is a standardization of different types of layout.

39
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:42,080
When you're looking at content within the theme this would be besides the home page but inside on perhaps

40
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:56,070
But if you wanted to have content and then a sidebar then you could present the site in that way where

41
00:04:56,190 --> 00:04:59,190
the pull images don't work the same way.

42
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,440
But there's room for a sidebar that could run down the length of the page.

43
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:11,100
And then there's a layout that is provided with the theme where the sidebars on the left and the content

44
00:05:14,620 --> 00:05:16,490
I'm going to leave it at for with content.

45
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:19,780
And let's go back and look at the next one.

46
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:27,720
Under content archives Genesys always gives us a lot of different options for how we want to display

47
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:39,120
say category pages or tag archive pages pages that show lists of posts or lists of pages we want to

48
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:53,280
excerpts instead that way we don't have to manually put in a read more link into each post in a blog

49
00:05:54,660 --> 00:06:01,650
We can let the theme take care of our excerpts for us and we can choose how many characters we want

50
00:06:03,270 --> 00:06:04,860
Excerpts.

51
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:22,140
to do as well as whether you want the featured image to the left or the right or with our alignment.

52
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:28,880
And then at the bottom of a list of posts there will be some navigation and within Genesys there is

53
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,500
to the Web site to navigate to different pages.

54
00:06:40,690 --> 00:06:48,230
That's just some examples of how the Genesis framework uses its parent theme and the child themes available

55
00:06:48,250 --> 00:06:53,950
and built on top of it to use some different functionality that the developers can place within the

56
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:56,560
customized.

57
00:06:56,790 --> 00:06:58,660
Let's go back to the dashboard.

58
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:04,830
And since I don't want to save my changes I'm going to go ahead and click the leave page button but

59
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:10,440
my browser is telling me you haven't saved your changes and so is asking me whether I want to stay on

60
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:20,160
In any case let's go to plug ins and what I'd like to do is to make a custom change to the style sheet

61
00:07:20,370 --> 00:07:24,690
without editing the child theme called parallax pro here.

62
00:07:33,510 --> 00:07:41,450
to put custom styles that don't get affected or don't get placed within the child theme style sheet.

63
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:51,440
Under appearance custom CSSA you can see it's a very simple editing window and you just enter your custom

64
00:07:58,430 --> 00:08:05,240
Now what simple edit could we make using CSSA to our parallax site.

65
00:08:07,640 --> 00:08:14,050
Maybe we could make the bread crumbs all caps instead of upper and lower case just then.

66
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:19,580
As an example of the kind of change that you could make it could be the same colors if you wanted to

67
00:08:24,320 --> 00:08:30,140
All kinds of different things you can control with the style sheet and making edits using simple custom

68
00:08:33,350 --> 00:08:40,160
But one thing I need to do is find where are the CSSA selectors that I need to use and what are they

69
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:42,510
to edit the bread crumbs.

70
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:48,760
Well I'm going to open tools web developer under Firefox and use the inspector.

71
00:08:49,100 --> 00:08:55,280
The Chrome Web Developer Tools are also available if you're using that browser and if I want to select

72
00:08:55,340 --> 00:09:04,060
the breadcrumbs area I can look down here under the styles and I can see that it's a class called breadcrumb

73
00:09:04,070 --> 00:09:12,580
dot breadcrumb And here's the a little block of code that I can use if I just select it here and hit

74
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:21,670
Now I can close that and just place that whole piece of code in there.

75
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:27,710
I know that I want to leave much of this the same in fact I'm leave all that the same so I can just

76
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:33,740
But for now I'll just leave it there if I hit enter.

77
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:36,350
Use one more tab to line up my code.

78
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:40,880
I could use a text transform.

79
00:09:43,910 --> 00:09:50,840
But if you look up in Google or another search engine something like Tex transform you can look up all

80
00:09:54,470 --> 00:10:01,160
It's a text transform colon uppercase and then with a semicolon after Zardoz copy that

81
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:10,700
plays it back into my text block my code block and hit update custom C Ss.

82
00:10:10,710 --> 00:10:16,620
Now this is adding this C-s as property not within the child theme but within this plugin that I am

83
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:27,510
But if I refresh the page there we are all uppercase.

84
00:10:27,550 --> 00:10:33,910
So we've made a fundamental change to the breadcrumbs on the website without editing the CSSA or the

85
00:10:33,960 --> 00:10:35,400
stylesheet of the child.

86
00:10:35,410 --> 00:10:43,950
The now I know I added an additional line to the CSA selector here but what if I wanted to change something.

87
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:57,720
I could just change it from 20 to 10 and these CSSA selectors are going to overwrite the original ones

88
00:10:58,020 --> 00:10:59,750
so that I can make that change.

89
00:10:59,880 --> 00:11:04,460
And I don't have to change the stylesheet of the child theme.

90
00:11:04,470 --> 00:11:10,080
Now that's a little small so I might just go ahead and revert back to something like 16

91
00:11:14,070 --> 00:11:17,800
say that and let's see how it looks great.

92
00:11:17,870 --> 00:11:18,840
That looks nice.

93
00:11:20,220 --> 00:11:27,120
One more change I'd like to make is to go back to the home page and if you recall when we changed to

94
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:37,640
here to that same color.

95
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:45,120
So if I just open up the tools again and the web developer toolbar look at the Inspector I can choose

96
00:11:48,510 --> 00:11:51,460
Yep that's the simple search social icons.

97
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:02,760
So if I go down to something that turns blue and select that whoops click inspector again select that

98
00:12:04,170 --> 00:12:10,000
I can see that the blue color here is 4 for a c e 8.

99
00:12:10,150 --> 00:12:16,890
So I'm just going to hit control-C and copy that and I know that I can get out of here and if I don't

100
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,240
area I know that I'm using a.

101
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:41,610
This plugin comes activated the simple social icons plug in again for Genesys.

102
00:12:41,730 --> 00:12:47,580
If you look under the widgets it gives you a widget that you can drag into agenesis widget area and

103
00:12:49,890 --> 00:12:54,870
You can see that over here it's a simple social icons widget that I dragged over here and then it's

104
00:13:02,760 --> 00:13:05,790
had copied the color number.

105
00:13:08,460 --> 00:13:12,090
Looks like it's that same blue that I want and I'll hit save

106
00:13:14,980 --> 00:13:16,240
as simple as that.

107
00:13:16,270 --> 00:13:18,490
Another Genesys powered plug in.

108
00:13:18,520 --> 00:13:22,960
That's easily editable and if I go to the bottom of the page.

109
00:13:23,170 --> 00:13:28,430
Now I've got blue icons that match my rollover colors all over the rest of the site.

110
00:13:31,090 --> 00:13:37,060
In this lesson you made further edits to the Genesis child theme parallax pro and even went as far as

111
00:13:43,450 --> 00:13:49,090
the chapter by exploring other options for adding code to child themes without editing their file structure

112
00:13:49,330 --> 00:13:51,880
which is useful for using frameworks like Gen.
