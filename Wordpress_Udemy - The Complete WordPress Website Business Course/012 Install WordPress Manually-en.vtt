00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.370
A great way to play with wordpress for your coursework and for building WordPress sites is to install

2
00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.570
I introduced several free options that make it easy to install WordPress locally in this video.

3
00:00:15.660 --> 00:00:21.150
You'll use the free program called Map to install a local server on your computer and create a local

4
00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:28.560
Then you'll learn how to install WordPress manually because everyone's computer is different.

5
00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.600
If you have any issues with map working on your computer.

6
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:42.300
You can also use desktop server instant W.P. or even your free site Ground hosting account to install

7
00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:52.530
You'll learn about how WordPress works between its file structure and connection to a database which

8
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.420
Let's get started.

9
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:03.450
Start by opening up your browser and navigating to map that info.

10
00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:08.470
The installation and setup process might be slightly different depending on whether you are on a Windows

11
00:01:15.080 --> 00:01:21.020
make sure that Windows is the box that's checked down here and then I'm going to download the correct

12
00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:27.530
It usually will detect the type of operating system that you're on and when you hit the download button

13
00:01:28.100 --> 00:01:32.200
it'll open a dialog box and you can click save file.

14
00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:39.050
It's going to take a few minutes here and I'll pause the video while that downloads now that it's downloaded

15
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:46.130
you can just double click the easy button or whatever the file was that it downloaded and click run

16
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.090
in Windows.

17
00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:57.390
It wants my permission to start and installing package and I'll just keep keep clicking next.

18
00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:01.230
I don't want map pro because we don't really need it for our purposes.

19
00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:05.550
Except the license agreement.

20
00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.760
You don't want to install it right directly onto your C-drive

21
00:02:11.990 --> 00:02:18.890
and I'm going to install it anyway because I already did have a map folder installed previously.

22
00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:26.510
Sure you can create a desktop icon and click install plus the video while this happens and then we'll

23
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:37.360
Ok now that it's finished installing I can click the finished button and now all that's left is to go

24
00:02:37.510 --> 00:02:49.700
and open map it either put an icon on your desktop or you can use the start window and map is opening

25
00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.790
And when those two green lights light up I'll know that it's activated and I'll go look at the preferences

26
00:03:06.820 --> 00:03:13.800
start page Yareli slash map that's fine and let's look at what we have for the web server H.T. docs.

27
00:03:13.810 --> 00:03:23.110
I'm going to put the Wordpress files into this folder see and map HD docs so that I can access it as

28
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:28.990
the web server and then I'll set up the database and install WordPress.

29
00:03:29.090 --> 00:03:37.670
So let's get started first by going to get get rid of this settings preferences screen and or click

30
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:41.910
Open start page.

31
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.730
I know that I am installed and map is running in the background.

32
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.300
Now I've got a server set up on my local computer and I can install WordPress along with the database

33
00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:07.830
and get it going so I'll navigate to WordPress dot org.

34
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:15.690
And up at the top right click the download button and they'll take me to this download page the latest

35
00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:24.830
At this point is down is WordPress 4.5 newly released yesterday and click save file.

36
00:04:25.130 --> 00:04:29.280
And those are all the word press corps files.

37
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:34.480
So now open up windows explorer and I'll move these files around to where I want them.

38
00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:37.090
First let's go to the downloads page here.

39
00:04:37.240 --> 00:04:39.180
My downloads folder I mean.

40
00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:46.720
And then I'm going to just navigate on my computer to my Web site company folder and my wordpress folder

41
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:54.070
now make a new folder for Wordpress 4.5

42
00:04:58.630 --> 00:05:09.480
usually use a dash instead of a dot or just word for 5.

43
00:05:09.510 --> 00:05:13.560
Here it is.

44
00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:21.800
Now if I right click in Windows and click extract all I can unzip the zip file

45
00:05:27.610 --> 00:05:29.480
has the video where that happens.

46
00:05:31.960 --> 00:05:32.780
There we go.

47
00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:37.390
Now I've got a folder that contains another folder called WordPress.

48
00:05:37.630 --> 00:05:41.020
And inside that folder are the word press corps files.

49
00:05:47.140 --> 00:05:51.960
bunch of PH P files that are part of the word press corps files.

50
00:05:54.720 --> 00:06:05.490
Now what I'm going to do is go to that map folder under Windows see Colin and map and here are all the

51
00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:16.890
And I know that H.T. docks is where we keep documents and actually have some from a previous map installation

52
00:06:17.130 --> 00:06:22.350
some WordPress installation folders that I have here from different versions of Wordpress I've been

53
00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:26.090
But I'll create a new one.

54
00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:34.800
And as you can see I usually call these local one local to I'm actually going to call this repeater

55
00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:41.870
of course one I repeat of course one.

56
00:06:42.780 --> 00:06:53.140
And inside that folder I want to put all the word press core files and folders and I want to keep my

57
00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:04.480
So as I drag them across my windows machine I get to hold control and copy these over to the HD Docs

58
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:21.500
map but slash charity of course one

59
00:07:25.250 --> 00:07:26.530
there's going to be an error.

60
00:07:26.810 --> 00:07:32.750
We haven't connected the Wordpress installation with its configuration file to the database yet.

61
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:37.670
Now it seems that WordPress is there and it wants to begin the installation.

62
00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:42.990
And if I start they need some information from the database.

63
00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:48.490
So I'm going to need these and they're going to try to create the W.P. config file.

64
00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:50.450
Now you can use this.

65
00:07:50.540 --> 00:07:58.370
But let's do this completely manually using a text editor so that you guys know how to set up WordPress

66
00:08:04.310 --> 00:08:08.970
So I'm just going to go ahead and go back to this screen and leave it there for now.

67
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:12.350
And let's go ahead and open our files up again.

68
00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:20.470
Now the file I'm looking for is called W.P. dash config dash sample and it's a PDP file so I know it's

69
00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.810
Hopefully you got set up with a code editor like Notepad plus plus or Adam.

70
00:08:30.850 --> 00:08:36.120
And if I just right click on it in Windows I can open it with the file I want.

71
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:37.630
So do that.

72
00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:46.840
And we're actually going to save it as W.P. dash config dot ph p.

73
00:08:47.110 --> 00:08:51.750
That's the file that WordPress is configured to use for its configuration information.

74
00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.130
It's where we put the credentials for the database.

75
00:08:54.310 --> 00:08:56.610
Among other security issues.

76
00:08:56.710 --> 00:09:08.100
So I've got this open in Adam and I'm in a click File Save As and I do want to save it in the exact

77
00:09:18.690 --> 00:09:20.360
have the right extension on there.

78
00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:27.310
So here we go I have got the desk config that HP and up here it shows me where it's located so I know

79
00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:33.740
There it is.

80
00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:40.800
So as we go down here we have a place we can enter the database name the database username password

81
00:09:41.220 --> 00:09:48.210
and then the database host which in a lot of cases even on a live server is called localhost.

82
00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:54.270
So now I need to set up the database within map so that I can put the credentials here and let WordPress

83
00:09:54.480 --> 00:09:56.160
connect to the database.

84
00:10:01.560 --> 00:10:08.320
And then I can click Open start page and again that'll open my browser

85
00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:14.620
and it should open the start page in another tab.

86
00:10:16.630 --> 00:10:17.140
It goes.

87
00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.760
I can verify that here up here localhost slash map.

88
00:10:21.890 --> 00:10:28.520
Great now that I'm at a map start page down here under my sequel my Escudo I have a little button called

89
00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:36.450
my admin if I click that button it'll open up an administrative panel for the database.

90
00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:42.380
You can see that there's some other database segments in there from other installations.

91
00:10:42.610 --> 00:10:51.640
But what you need to do from this page that first opens up the server server can local host you click

92
00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.730
And it says that it's loading.

93
00:10:56.830 --> 00:10:59.840
What that's doing is creating a new database.

94
00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.440
And I need to name it.

95
00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:04.290
I'm going to name it

96
00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:15.910
the same thing as my wordpress installation folder and click Create gives you a success message database

97
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:16.810
WB.

98
00:11:16.870 --> 00:11:18.720
Of course one has been created.

99
00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:25.540
And if I click on it you can see that there's no tables found in the database.

100
00:11:33.470 --> 00:11:41.660
So now that we have the database created map uses a standard set of credentials and that's what we'll

101
00:11:48.410 --> 00:11:50.870
The database name that I just created

102
00:11:54.050 --> 00:12:01.970
and the username and password you'd never want to use this in a live site because it's not secure but

103
00:12:09.230 --> 00:12:12.780
the word root and the password is the word root.

104
00:12:12.800 --> 00:12:15.220
There is one more configuration you might check.

105
00:12:15.290 --> 00:12:17.060
And that's the database host.

106
00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:24.830
Just go back to P-H PMI admin and look at your empty database and look at it says localhost right up

107
00:12:26.230 --> 00:12:35.170
Mine is localhost Colan 3 3 0 6 and so I'm going to use that credential for the database first.

108
00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:44.170
And control S and save where you can use file save.

109
00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:51.520
Now these credentials are also visible back in the map start page under my sequel.

110
00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:59.060
The host is there and the port is what you have to put coal in 3 3 0 6 and then user and password are

111
00:13:02.130 --> 00:13:12.220
Now I should be able to go back to my browser navigate to localhost slash the repeat.

112
00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:23.190
So I continue and it's connected to the database.

113
00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:33.250
I could just make a title for the site choose my user name make sure I remember this password.

114
00:13:34.050 --> 00:13:45.750
I just hit Control C for copy put an email address in and click install WordPress.

115
00:13:45.910 --> 00:13:48.090
I am going to open up Notepad.

116
00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:55.610
Just make sure that while I have that password on my clipboard that I have control V and just save it

117
00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:58.300
right there make sure I don't get rid of that success.

118
00:14:09.740 --> 00:14:10.490
Click log in

119
00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:15.260
great.

120
00:14:15.410 --> 00:14:23.600
I have a new fresh WordPress installation on my local computer and if we take just just real quick.

121
00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:31.460
Need to open it up open the site up a new tab and look at the front end of a fresh installation and

122
00:14:33.770 --> 00:14:34.950
Not on the internet.

123
00:14:35.030 --> 00:14:36.260
Just on my local machine.

124
00:14:39.350 --> 00:14:42.450
In this video you installed a map on your local computer.

125
00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:43.760
Set up a database.

126
00:14:43.880 --> 00:14:48.890
Edited the WP dash config file and install WordPress.

127
00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.050
totally in private as much as you want.

128
00:14:56.060 --> 00:15:02.030
Next we'll explore the inner workings of your new local WordPress installation to get to know how everything

129
00:15:03.530 --> 00:15:04.070
See there
