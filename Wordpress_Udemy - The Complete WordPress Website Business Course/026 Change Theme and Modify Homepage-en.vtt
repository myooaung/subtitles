00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:08.120
In this video you'll activate the 2014 theme and rearrange three posts as sample posts for the photography

2
00:00:09.650 --> 00:00:14.990
Since we've imported the sample content SML File we're able to see how all content types look in the

3
00:00:16.100 --> 00:00:22.100
Now we'll edit a couple of the posts to look how we predict the client will use them plus we'll configure

4
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:32.240
In this lesson you'll experience how creating some sample content can help steer the design process.

5
00:00:32.270 --> 00:00:38.420
As you can figure a particular theme for the client first open up your local WordPress installation

6
00:00:42.740 --> 00:00:49.190
Make sure you're logged into the dashboard and rollover appearance themes and lets activate the 2014

7
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:55.980
Now we'll just take a look at it.

8
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:07.020
Gray

9
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:10.270
OK.

10
00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.530
The first thing we'll do is rearrange the home page just a little bit.

11
00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:20.680
Right now if you remember we've got the hello world sample post that was created when we installed Wordpress

12
00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.260
and we've got some imported posts from the sample SML file.

13
00:01:27.270 --> 00:01:30.360
Let's create a few posts as if we were the photographer

14
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:40.400
let's go over to the dashboard and roll over posts and create add new I think what I'll do is create

15
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:48.390
I'll speed up the video while I go through this process.

16
00:01:57.810 --> 00:02:07.510
And now I'd like to do on each of the three posts is at a featured image.

17
00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:10.110
I'm going to go ahead and use the image we've been using

18
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:23.460
and here I'm speeding up the video again as I add an image to each one of these posts.

19
00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:42.230
Now instead of having these posts in the Uncategorized category I'm going to create a new category for

20
00:02:54.090 --> 00:03:00.270
Great now that I have that category I can go to the all posts page and I'm going to add each of these

21
00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:04.570
three posts into that category by using the quick edit button

22
00:03:10.110 --> 00:03:17.720
and I'm going to take them out of the Uncategorized category as well by using the quick edit button.

23
00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:25.140
You can edit a few different items for each post quickly without having to open each post.

24
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:50.210
Here we go now within the sample content.

25
00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:08.050
so that all I'm showing are the latest posts and if you remember from the last video we chose to show

26
00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:13.020
three posts in one on the archive pages and the home page.

27
00:04:19.680 --> 00:04:22.080
Now we're starting to look good.

28
00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:29.190
Now I don't have any content on each of those pages but I'll paste some Lorem Ipsum text if you remember

29
00:04:37.200 --> 00:04:43.560
And let's go to each one of those pages and paste a little text so that we can see what text would look

30
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:23.160
Great now that I've got some text in all three posts let's refresh the page and see what that looks

31
00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:31.900
Nice.

32
00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:38.120
You may have noticed that the featured images are not reaching all the way to the far right side of

33
00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:46.250
These diagonal lines are an overlay that appears on top of the featured image and it has to do with

34
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:48.400
the image ratio.

35
00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:54.740
The standard size image 6900 by twelve hundred is a little bit tall and so when it places it in the

36
00:05:58.930 --> 00:06:04.470
Let's go back into the dashboard into the media library and see what we can do about that.

37
00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:13.230
I'm going to go ahead and pick one of these sample images that came with our ex-MIL upload.

38
00:06:13.620 --> 00:06:21.480
If I choose big sur you can see that I've gone ahead and I've actually edited the images from 6900 by

39
00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:33.570
Now by doing this it's going to fit inside of this content area in terms of the featured image very

40
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:47.130
I'll click a featured image to edit which one I'm choosing.

41
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.720
Let's go down to that big sur image 16:00 by 800.

42
00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:59.190
That's a ratio of two to one.

43
00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.670
I'll update the page and let's see what it looks like.

44
00:07:05.980 --> 00:07:11.770
Now you can see that the image reaches to the far side of the page and wraps around the post area.

45
00:07:15.550 --> 00:07:22.000
Now let's take a look back inside the media library and I just want to show you that editing an image

46
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.230
It always saves the old image so that you can get back to the original if I open up that image.

47
00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:51.230
And the added image button is where I went below in order to edit the image and there is restore original

48
00:07:51.290 --> 00:07:52.700
image right here.

49
00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:06.800
update you can see dimensions will go back to 6900 by twelve hundred.

50
00:08:06.810 --> 00:08:14.570
And if I go back and refresh the page now that image will revert back to being the wrong proportions.

51
00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:21.030
So let me show you how to go in and edit an image inside the media library and we'll fix this so that

52
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:23.470
it fits inside the featured image area.

53
00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:28.850
Go ahead and open the media library and open an image.

54
00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:36.410
One of the samples or even the original image that you downloaded from W.P. of course dot com.

55
00:08:36.770 --> 00:08:41.880
And let's go ahead and click Edit below the image.

56
00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.580
Now there's a few different options that you have here.

57
00:08:44.600 --> 00:08:50.810
One of the things you can do is if you just place the mouse inside the image itself and drag a square

58
00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.500
open.

59
00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:54.050
We're going to be using the cropping function.

60
00:09:02.450 --> 00:09:06.220
the right over here I can make this 6900 by 800.

61
00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:14.040
If I like I can even place it as a 2 to 1 ratio if I want.

62
00:09:14.030 --> 00:09:16.690
And it creates it into 6900 by 800.

63
00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:23.720
And now just drag that into the place I want to crop and hit the crop button at the top left.

64
00:09:29.060 --> 00:09:37.540
And now that made my changes there and I can hit update under the media library.

65
00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:48.310
Great now if I go back and refresh the page you can see that that makes a nice big featured image.

66
00:09:48.540 --> 00:09:56.750
So I'll go through and change post to and post one as well and you can go ahead and do the same.

67
00:09:56.790 --> 00:10:03.050
Now I went in and used another of the sample images and I cropped it the same way I showed you how before

68
00:10:03.290 --> 00:10:07.880
this one was an 800 pixel wide image so it's 800 by 400.

69
00:10:08.150 --> 00:10:16.190
And I wanted to go ahead and use the firewood image in post one here but I don't want to lose the larger

70
00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.780
proportion of image that I already have.

71
00:10:19.790 --> 00:10:25.550
So one of the things I'm going to do go back into the media library I'm going to find that image and

72
00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:39.520
pull another version of this image into my browser save it and then read upload it into the media library

73
00:10:42.790 --> 00:10:50.680
If I just click right here and copy with Control-C and then open and place that you Arel into the browser

74
00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:57.600
the browser will open the image Zarmina right click and say save image as.

75
00:10:58.160 --> 00:11:00.800
And then I can go and save that image wherever I want.

76
00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:08.320
So I'm going to label it large image too and save that image.

77
00:11:08.330 --> 00:11:12.800
Now if I go back into the media library I can go ahead and hit add new

78
00:11:16.740 --> 00:11:23.080
select files and I can find that in my downloads folder.

79
00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:25.770
There it is great.

80
00:11:36.710 --> 00:11:41.660
and I'll still have the original version in a separate place inside the media library.

81
00:11:44.700 --> 00:11:54.050
Go ahead and make my Krop approximately two to one and that I'm going to go ahead to two one.

82
00:11:54.060 --> 00:11:54.480
Enter

83
00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:59.080
16:00 by 800.

84
00:11:59.250 --> 00:12:03.300
I'll hit the button and hit save

85
00:12:07.180 --> 00:12:14.770
now I need to go into the posts and find post one and replace the featured image with the newly cropped

86
00:12:17.390 --> 00:12:19.480
That way I have the original size.

87
00:12:19.490 --> 00:12:23.600
If I ever want to use it inside of a post or somewhere else.

88
00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:38.790
There it is 6900 by 800 set featured image is the correct proportions.

89
00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:41.430
Quick update and then let's look at the result

90
00:12:49.860 --> 00:12:50.530
nice.

91
00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.640
That looks much better.

92
00:12:54.600 --> 00:13:01.710
Now let's configure the featured area that's included with the 2014 theme at the top of the page.

93
00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:09.300
If we take a look under appearance themes and just take a look at the preview again you can see that

94
00:13:10.380 --> 00:13:18.540
There's a grid of featured images and posts that we can place at the top of the home page the featured

95
00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:30.560
featured content.

96
00:13:30.670 --> 00:13:37.130
Then you can choose a grid or a slider and it says tag name featured.

97
00:13:37.190 --> 00:13:44.570
So all I have to do is label my three posts with the tag featured and I'll be able to put them up on

98
00:13:51.830 --> 00:13:59.460
It shows nothing up there yet because I need to label those posts with the tag featured.

99
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:03.430
So if I hit posts I'll post.

100
00:14:03.710 --> 00:14:07.280
I can use the quick edit button to add tags.

101
00:14:18.320 --> 00:14:18.890
Now quick.

102
00:14:24.970 --> 00:14:26.770
categories right here.

103
00:14:33.790 --> 00:14:40.200
you can click on them and click add.

104
00:14:40.210 --> 00:14:46.130
Now that I've updated all three posts with the featured tag let's take a look at the home page.

105
00:14:49.350 --> 00:14:49.830
Nice.

106
00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.870
the home page.

107
00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:07.420
Just a couple of last things to point out in this video that you may notice first this smaller 800 pixel

108
00:15:07.450 --> 00:15:14.260
image isn't large enough to fit the full image area in the featured posts so I might use a larger 6900

109
00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:26.740
Secondly 2014 is designed so that any posts in the featured area up top does not repeat itself down

110
00:15:26.770 --> 00:15:28.660
in the content area.

111
00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:34.670
You can replace this image if you like or just leave it alone.

112
00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:40.150
In this video you changed the theme of the website while keeping the existing content.

113
00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:46.580
Then you created three sample posts to conform to the style presented in the 2014 theme and then use

114
00:15:50.780 --> 00:15:56.240
By using the built in image editor inside the Wordpress media library you were able to change some of

115
00:15:59.210 --> 00:16:05.360
Next you'll revise the navigation and remaining widgets to adjust the content even further for the theme

116
00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:07.120
making the site look great.
