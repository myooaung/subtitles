00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.940
In this video what configured the contact form plug in and insert it into the contact page.

2
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:15.570
web site using a contact form like this is a professional untidy way of communicating with web site

3
00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:23.460
You'll learn how to use the contact form 7 plug in its many possible configurations and how to embed

4
00:00:26.810 --> 00:00:30.140
First taking a look at the dashboard you know we keep seeing this.

5
00:00:32.190 --> 00:00:36.680
You know welcome screen but you can dismiss it and then it'll go away.

6
00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:44.150
Now under screen options there's always checkboxes for what you need or what you don't need on your

7
00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:46.940
desktop dashboard for wordpress.

8
00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:53.790
And so if you check that box that will come back when you dismiss it it and checks it.

9
00:00:53.810 --> 00:00:55.810
Here's your challenge for this video.

10
00:00:55.880 --> 00:01:02.630
Since we have the contact form 7 plug in activated we have the contact menu bar over here on the left

11
00:01:03.530 --> 00:01:11.090
Go ahead and add a contact form configure it a little bit and inserted into the contact page for the

12
00:01:14.570 --> 00:01:15.960
How to go.

13
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:17.130
Here's how I'd do it.

14
00:01:17.930 --> 00:01:27.640
Go over to contact forms and you can see that contact form 7 also has a dismissable message but it already

15
00:01:27.910 --> 00:01:33.240
populates the plug in with a contact form that's been made already.

16
00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:49.030
But if I look at the contact form one I might just open that and use it for my contact form.

17
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:02.430
contact form and then you can see contact form 7 gives you a few tabs across the top.

18
00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:10.620
One is the form the next is the mail tab and this will show you how your message is going to be mailed

19
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:22.530
to the person that filled out the form showing them what they sent you.

20
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:29.010
Messages are when the form gets sent.

21
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.790
whether the form was sent and then there are some additional settings.

22
00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:47.550
If you need customisation code snippets that you've gotten from around the internet or other things

23
00:02:52.110 --> 00:03:00.040
But for now the simple form is probably find a name and email a subject a message and a send button.

24
00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:08.180
I might leave it as is for now and when I come here I can see that I would like to receive the messages

25
00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:09.730
at this email address.

26
00:03:10.850 --> 00:03:12.350
My name Sure.

27
00:03:12.380 --> 00:03:23.210
The subject and then it'll put all these things in the body of my message and the default message sounds

28
00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:31.730
I'll just hit save since I changed the form name and if I just click once in a shortcut here I can hit

29
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:38.760
this looks like.

30
00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:48.600
With a short code that surrounded by brackets the way that that that is you don't have to place it in

31
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:51.640
either the text tab or as text right here.

32
00:03:52.700 --> 00:04:02.180
What you can do is just paste the contact form as it is with the brackets straight into the body area.

33
00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:12.570
Refresh the page

34
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:19.340
create a nice looking contact form the button looks nice.

35
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:22.820
Tell me which fields are required.

36
00:04:25.820 --> 00:04:27.820
Great.

37
00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.030
Now if you're building this site in your local development environment using map the way that I am We're

38
00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:38.980
not going to be able to actually test what this e-mail looks like when it sends because we don't have

39
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:42.790
a mail server installed on our local computer.

40
00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:50.080
But when I'm building web sites I'll generally build them at my live server either behind a maintenance

41
00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:57.610
And that way I can test that the contact form works if I am building a site in a local environment like

42
00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:03.120
I'll just place the contact form here and then once I migrate the site to the live server I'll make

43
00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:08.460
If you do happen to fill it out

44
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:19.170
and test it let's go ahead and look at what the message says.

45
00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:24.310
Once we hit the send button it's got some little.

46
00:05:24.370 --> 00:05:26.480
Ah there was an error trying to send your message.

47
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.100
Please try again later.

48
00:05:28.530 --> 00:05:33.810
And that's because we're not attached to the Internet and there's no mail server here in my local environment.

49
00:05:35.670 --> 00:05:41.460
In a later chapter we'll be going over transactional emails that WordPress sends from the server marketing

50
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:49.450
e-mails through a service like MailChimp and other ways of e-mailing through Web sites.

51
00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:04.130
form 7 plug in back under contact contact forms.

52
00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:14.970
I can edit this form and if you remember there were a bunch of different buttons for the form tab here.

53
00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:24.890
Things like e-mail telephone Jor-El's a number a date a text area a dropdown menu and these pieces of

54
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:38.000
But suppose I wanted to do something like a dropdown or maybe radio buttons I wanted to have I wanted

55
00:06:47.220 --> 00:06:48.260
just an example.

56
00:06:48.420 --> 00:06:51.870
But if I hit insert tag There we go.

57
00:06:58.590 --> 00:07:00.220
Male and female.

58
00:07:00.750 --> 00:07:10.600
And so what I usually do is just copy and paste other sections so that I have the line break and the

59
00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:11.610
text here

60
00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:17.060
that I want.

61
00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:20.670
And then you've got to close the paragraph tag

62
00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:25.730
right now if I save that contact form.

63
00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:33.620
Because it's pasted into my contact page using this sure code once I change it here it will be changed

64
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:42.170
But there's one more thing I need to add and that is in the mail area when I send myself an email from

65
00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:57.170
I also want to know the answer to that other question the gender.

66
00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:04.100
And so if I just scroll up just a little bit since I created another field inside of the contact form.

67
00:08:09.950 --> 00:08:15.270
Once the users answered that question so I'll just copy paste it here.

68
00:08:17.030 --> 00:08:17.930
And save the for

69
00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:22.700
great.

70
00:08:23.570 --> 00:08:30.800
So in this way you can really build a contact form for any purpose using so many different types of

71
00:08:34.170 --> 00:08:39.960
There's quizzes recapture to prevent comment spam and things like that.

72
00:08:41.330 --> 00:08:47.620
Now suppose I wanted to place that contact form on the sidebar of every page on the site.

73
00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:52.080
It's as simple as placing a short code inside of a widget on the side bar.

74
00:08:52.250 --> 00:08:58.130
Let's go ahead and do that real quick grab copy the short code again.

75
00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:02.670
Let's go to appearance widgets.

76
00:09:03.140 --> 00:09:10.850
And then to place any kind of item HDMI out or text or even images inside of a sidebar widget you can

77
00:09:20.870 --> 00:09:22.090
I can title it.

78
00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:31.930
and that's just place that shortcut there.

79
00:09:33.010 --> 00:09:35.530
Now refresh the page here and we'll see what it looks like.

80
00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:44.960
Great Again a nice looking form formatted for the text widget.

81
00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:49.600
Now I don't think I want to have the contact form on the sidebar and be present on every page of the

82
00:09:53.620 --> 00:10:00.100
One thing is that there's an available widgets section on the page and then in active widgets section

83
00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:03.590
that you can use to save widgets with their current settings.

84
00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:07.540
If you like so I'll take that.

85
00:10:12.160 --> 00:10:15.090
Now the inactive widgets will keep their settings.

86
00:10:15.130 --> 00:10:21.790
So if I just drag the contact me text widget across WordPress we'll save it there for me if I ever want

87
00:10:24.550 --> 00:10:31.560
So if I refresh the page I can see that that will be removed from the sidebar in this lesson.

88
00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:36.760
You've configured a simple contact form using the contact form 7 plug in and checked out the different

89
00:10:42.580 --> 00:10:47.280
Contact page as well as in a sidebar widget in the next video.

90
00:10:47.300 --> 00:10:52.040
We'll continue to build out the contact page with an interactive location map using the Google Maps

91
00:10:52.140 --> 00:10:53.530
Forgan Let's go
