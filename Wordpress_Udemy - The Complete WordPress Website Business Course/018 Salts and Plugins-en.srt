1
00:00:00,590 --> 00:00:06,200
The word assault or a series of encryption codes that keep the Administrator account and dashboard area

2
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:13,580
secure in this video you'll learn how to add these security codes to the W.P. config file and you'll

3
00:00:19,430 --> 00:00:20,300
Let's get started.

4
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:31,340
As you remember to set up this WordPress installation we went into the map area opened up the database

5
00:00:33,230 --> 00:00:42,980
And we also had to customize the WP dash config file in order to attach the website installation to

6
00:00:44,990 --> 00:00:50,750
If you've got your site Ground manually installed site open you can go to the see panel and use the

7
00:00:53,990 --> 00:01:00,050
When that opens you can see that I have the core installation files here and then of course the brochure

8
00:01:04,550 --> 00:01:11,210
Let's just open the W.P. config file right here in the auto installed WordPress installation.

9
00:01:13,670 --> 00:01:19,760
That opens the W.P. config file inside my code editor here and down below the database information you

10
00:01:24,740 --> 00:01:32,100
The auto installer has taken care of using specific Salt's that it got from the wordpress site automatically.

11
00:01:32,390 --> 00:01:36,430
If we go back I'll just close that in the file manager.

12
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,130
in the code editor.

13
00:01:45,180 --> 00:01:49,570
This is the same thing as looking at it in our text editor like Adam.

14
00:01:49,940 --> 00:01:55,100
If I scroll down a little bit you can see that it just has a blank statement puts put your unique phrase

15
00:01:56,090 --> 00:02:02,330
So like in our local environment we can do the same thing inside the code editor here at Control-C to

16
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:15,710
Paste it into there and now it's loading me up a nice fresh set of keys.

17
00:02:15,790 --> 00:02:22,990
I hit control-C to copy that and back into the document and code editor I'll select it again that whole

18
00:02:25,810 --> 00:02:26,140
Great.

19
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,470
Now I can close that editor and everything is done.

20
00:02:35,620 --> 00:02:41,950
We can go through that same process in our code editor on our local machine to edit the WP config file

21
00:02:41,980 --> 00:02:44,290
in our local installation.

22
00:02:44,510 --> 00:02:51,020
Go ahead and make that edit of your WP config file in both installations puzzle video now and give it

23
00:02:52,220 --> 00:02:53,760
Did you get that done.

24
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:54,140
Great.

25
00:02:55,670 --> 00:03:00,880
The control as to save and to prove that it worked.

26
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:04,470
If I go back to the dashboard try to refresh the page.

27
00:03:04,490 --> 00:03:05,060
Oops.

28
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:14,850
That proves that the secure keys are working.

29
00:03:15,770 --> 00:03:20,900
And if you ever have any fear about the security of your site or your dashboard you can go ahead and

30
00:03:23,960 --> 00:03:27,480
And then you'll be forced to log back in again.

31
00:03:27,500 --> 00:03:33,080
The reason we didn't set up the assault and authentication keys inside of our flywheel sample account

32
00:03:33,350 --> 00:03:39,510
is that the managed WordPress hosting at flywheel manages your W.P. config file privately.

33
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:44,840
They don't let you access it yourself to make changes because they're editing it for best practices

34
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:48,080
and security within their hosting system.

35
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,600
in the W.P. config file but flywheel keeps it secure and manages it for you.

36
00:04:07,880 --> 00:04:17,480
sites that camp is right here and as recommended in the previous chapter I can open up Firefox and fire

37
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:33,770
So I'll go up to the top of my list here and click Create an account and paste that host right in here.

38
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:42,380
And I'm going to use my username and my password.

39
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,230
choose security as FGP which is secure FGP and hit OK.

40
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:02,900
And now that I have done that I can click connect and it will connect to my Web site files at flywheel

41
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:09,500
via my FCP program over here on the right hand side I can use the little arrows to click below my site

42
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:17,550
side as it opens up on the server.

43
00:05:17,810 --> 00:05:26,120
Now if I click that W.P. config file and I go over here on my computer side under users there is my

44
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:39,650
it on the right and clicking that left arrow button gives me a message down here that it's place it

45
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:42,470
Great.

46
00:05:42,590 --> 00:05:53,190
Now over in Adam my code editor I can open a file and navigate to the desktop where I just save that

47
00:05:53,220 --> 00:05:54,460
under a brochure site.

48
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:58,540
There's the W.P. config file there click open.

49
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,090
And here's my W.P. config file at flywheel.

50
00:06:05,010 --> 00:06:09,660
It says this is automatically generated by flywheel and you will not be able to edit this file yourself.

51
00:06:09,750 --> 00:06:15,690
And if you make an edit of this local version of the file for instance to choose new songs and keys

52
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:23,710
It won't actually replace the flywheel generated W.P. config file.

53
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:33,070
We'll be setting for plugins up in order to give some functionality to this brochure site and for all

54
00:06:37,960 --> 00:06:39,040
life server.

55
00:06:39,370 --> 00:06:49,370
So under plug ins add new I'd like you to go in and look for for free plugins from the repository.

56
00:07:00,140 --> 00:07:03,810
Go ahead and search around the plugin repository and see what you can find.

57
00:07:06,650 --> 00:07:14,150
All right what you may have done is gone into the search window on the top right there and perhaps you

58
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,550
one you choose.

59
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:35,670
and choose from the plug ins and themes in the repository to make sure you're getting one that's going

60
00:07:41,550 --> 00:07:43,440
Now there's so many contact forms here.

61
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:47,790
I know the one that I like is called Contact form 7.

62
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:54,530
It's probably the most popular and most well used contact form plug in inside of wordpress.

63
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:56,150
So I just click Install now.

64
00:07:58,670 --> 00:08:01,820
It'll give me a message after the plug it has been installed.

65
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:10,880
And I can hit activate plug in right from that installation screen if I want to.

66
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:17,950
And just to verify that we know what's going on under the folders of this brochure site.

67
00:08:26,140 --> 00:08:32,620
and we've downloaded it off the Internet out of the Wordpress darg plugin repository.

68
00:08:32,650 --> 00:08:39,370
So under what WordPress darg under plug ins Here's a very similar screen to what we find inside our

69
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:48,940
And if I search for that same plug in it should come right up.

70
00:08:49,180 --> 00:08:55,670
If I open the page for that plug in I can get a lot of information here across these tabs.

71
00:08:55,690 --> 00:09:01,500
You can download it directly and then upload it into the plugins directory of your Wordpress installation.

72
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:10,210
But all this information here is also available inside of the installed plug in screen which is right

73
00:09:11,350 --> 00:09:17,080
And then if you hit view details on any of the plug ins that's going to pull up information directly

74
00:09:23,980 --> 00:09:27,890
different information that the plugin authors give to you.

75
00:09:29,050 --> 00:09:35,440
One of the things I always look for is that I make sure that this plug in has been updated recently

76
00:09:35,740 --> 00:09:38,830
it's compatible with the version of Wordpress that I'm using.

77
00:09:44,260 --> 00:09:50,940
know that the developers support the plug in that I want to use.

78
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,940
Now when I said an email protection plugin you might not have known exactly what I meant there but one

79
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:05,750
by spam bots across the Internet.

80
00:10:05,790 --> 00:10:13,110
In the case that they actually type their email address into a page or a post or place it on the Contact

81
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:25,970
from being harvested by spam bots.

82
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:28,520
But I appreciate this one.

83
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:30,850
Plug in

84
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:40,790
ah here it is email address and coater by till Kreutz.

85
00:10:40,870 --> 00:10:46,750
It is a lightweight plug in which means it doesn't take any bandwidth or space at all inside of your

86
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:54,370
All it does is it converts the e-mail address when it recognizes it to a hexadecimal so that the bots

87
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:56,010
can't harvest it.

88
00:10:57,640 --> 00:11:04,910
So I usually click Install now and activate the plug in the e-mail address and coater doesn't take any

89
00:11:05,990 --> 00:11:13,020
It automatically recognizes e-mail addresses inside of the Web site and converts them to hexadecimal.

90
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:18,790
Let's take a quick look at how that works.

91
00:11:18,840 --> 00:11:26,580
I'm just going to go ahead and put an e-mail address straight into the front page of the Web site and

92
00:11:33,030 --> 00:11:36,710
it won't be harvestable by spam bots.

93
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:42,120
Even if I were to make it and link and have it be clickable it won't be harvestable.

94
00:11:42,540 --> 00:11:44,140
So let's go ahead and update this page

95
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:57,790
great a real email address that's visible on the front page of the Web site.

96
00:11:57,840 --> 00:12:02,610
There it is.

97
00:12:02,760 --> 00:12:07,680
Let me open my web developer toolbar and then click view source

98
00:12:10,240 --> 00:12:18,250
and if I scroll down to the source of this page let's see if I go into the body and I can see the site

99
00:12:18,280 --> 00:12:19,310
header header.

100
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:20,850
And here's the entry content.

101
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:25,990
The first line look at all that hexadecimal code.

102
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:33,650
It basically converts every few letters or many of the letters in the email address to hexadecimal codes

103
00:12:34,080 --> 00:12:36,750
instead of the actual lettering.

104
00:12:38,900 --> 00:12:44,030
So it makes it readable by the browser but not readable by the spam bots.

105
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:57,580
At the same time if that e-mail address potentially I want it to be a mail to link like that

106
00:13:00,360 --> 00:13:05,520
that would make an email address clickable.

107
00:13:05,730 --> 00:13:07,470
So let's see I refresh the page.

108
00:13:09,810 --> 00:13:15,420
That means that it will open up my email program and send an e-mail to that web address.

109
00:13:15,810 --> 00:13:19,430
When I click the link.

110
00:13:19,520 --> 00:13:20,920
But if we do the same thing

111
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:33,110
look at the source of that page even when it's a clickable link I can see that even inside of the link

112
00:13:39,410 --> 00:13:50,290
as well so that it's not harvestable by the spam bots.

113
00:13:50,410 --> 00:13:53,080
I'm going to go ahead and take that e-mail address out now.

114
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:03,090
Update the page there's plenty of Google Analytics plug ins and you can actually depending on the way

115
00:14:09,150 --> 00:14:15,620
But it's easier to use a plugin in this case perhaps you were and found a number of Google Analytics

116
00:14:21,620 --> 00:14:28,850
their web site.

117
00:14:34,020 --> 00:14:37,840
Well there's a lot of Google Analytics plugins.

118
00:14:37,910 --> 00:14:45,980
One of the best ones is the Google Analytics Hayter by sumo me I often use that Sukhumi as often a free

119
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:53,170
service that I use for social sharing and networking which we'll get into in a later video as well.

120
00:14:54,180 --> 00:15:01,800
But you can activate that plug in right away and then set up the code directly with your clients.

121
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:03,170
Google Analytics account

122
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,050
one more to go.

123
00:15:08,410 --> 00:15:10,540
Let's search for Google Maps plugin

124
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:21,390
great.

125
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:27,840
First thing I'm looking at is the number of active installs and the number of positive reviews.

126
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:38,550
300000 active installations as I scroll down I don't see anyone quite as popular.

127
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,840
Here's a good one.

128
00:15:39,950 --> 00:15:41,530
Looks like compatible.

129
00:15:41,570 --> 00:15:44,800
Updated four days ago 100000 installs.

130
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:48,410
But boy this one updated six hours ago.

131
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,460
That one looks good.

132
00:15:55,820 --> 00:15:56,120
Great.

133
00:15:56,160 --> 00:15:57,300
I'll activate the plug in

134
00:16:00,810 --> 00:16:06,480
and later in this chapter will configure each one of these four plug ins and customize it for the brochure

135
00:16:09,100 --> 00:16:15,550
In this lesson you used the word press encryption keys and salt's generator to paste security codes

136
00:16:15,580 --> 00:16:20,000
into the WP config file and saw how it logged you out of wordpress.

137
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:25,780
Then you went and found for free plug ins from the Wordpress plugin repository that will be using in

138
00:16:30,520 --> 00:16:36,550
Next will customize the home page of the site choosing the layout will also look at the difference between
