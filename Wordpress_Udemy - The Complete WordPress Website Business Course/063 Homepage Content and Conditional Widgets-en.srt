1
00:00:00,860 --> 00:00:06,560
In this video we'll wrap up the Cafepress site with some finishing touches organizing our new content.

2
00:00:06,810 --> 00:00:12,570
You'll organize the photography content into the home page sections and you'll create a dynamic footer

3
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:24,210
by the end we'll have finished our site with display of the custom post type content and created a widget

4
00:00:29,050 --> 00:00:35,080
Looking at our site that I have open in another tab I'm looking at the photographs archive page which

5
00:00:40,060 --> 00:00:48,490
An excerpt of the content on the right along with the category or photo type and the tags over on the

6
00:00:49,450 --> 00:00:56,650
Now when we're looking at an archive page or the home page we've got three widgets across the bottom

7
00:00:56,890 --> 00:00:58,890
the middle one is recent posts.

8
00:00:59,050 --> 00:01:06,820
But what I'd like to do is for one we have a single post open and looking at a single photo.

9
00:01:06,910 --> 00:01:12,940
I want this center widget to display the image data like I have right here.

10
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:22,230
Well if I go back into the Wordpress dashboard under plug ins one of the plug ins that I have which

11
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,740
Go ahead and navigate to plug ins and click activate so that you activate the custom sidebars pro plugin

12
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:42,510
that will enable us to display any widget inside of a widget area conditionally or only on certain pages

13
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,180
so that I have that plugin activated.

14
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:54,150
Let's go back into appearance widgets and you'll see that this plug in makes the widget page look slightly

15
00:01:56,140 --> 00:01:59,530
It's got all of our standard widgets over here on the right side.

16
00:02:00,010 --> 00:02:03,000
And we've got custom sidebars here.

17
00:02:03,310 --> 00:02:10,930
So if I want to make under custom sidebars or create a new one and this one is going to be image data

18
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:13,780
and you can follow along and do the same thing.

19
00:02:13,950 --> 00:02:22,330
I'll just create that sidebar which is basically a widget area called image data inside of the image

20
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:27,890
I'm going to scroll down here a little bit and put a text widget inside.

21
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:34,450
I'm going to call it image data and then the content is going to be a short code that displays that

22
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:35,430
image data.

23
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:43,790
So when we save this for now then I'm going to go back and find inside of my custom press content types.

24
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:53,190
I'm going to look for my custom fields and if I click Custom fields block with the brackets and could

25
00:02:53,270 --> 00:02:58,230
Control-C to copy it I've got that short code and I can stick it wherever I want.

26
00:03:07,190 --> 00:03:12,460
text widget place that shortcut by control the copying it right in there.

27
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:19,320
I'll scroll down just a little bit so I can see the bottom of this widget area and I'm going to click.

28
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:37,220
to and I'd like to only place it in footer too when I have a separate post type of photographs.

29
00:03:37,320 --> 00:03:44,910
And so when I'm looking at a photograph post type it's going to replace what I have in footer to stand

30
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:50,510
as a standard with this image data widget and I click save changes.

31
00:03:50,520 --> 00:03:58,190
Now if we go over to the single post prairie truck and refresh the page I'm looking at a photograph.

32
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:14,620
So if I go to an archive page like landscape go down to the footer it's got whatever I had as a standard

33
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:23,730
But if I choose any single image which is a photograph post type I go down and I've replaced that widget

34
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:26,320
with the camera image data.

35
00:04:26,920 --> 00:04:34,510
So by using custom sidebars pro we're learning about conditional formatting or dynamic content that

36
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:47,980
There is another free dynamic widgets plugin that I've found that works well it's just not quite as

37
00:04:48,010 --> 00:04:54,860
easy or powerful but in wordpress dot org I'll show you what that plugin is under.

38
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:00,400
Plugins we can do a search for dynamic widgets

39
00:05:04,230 --> 00:05:06,010
here it is by Kerl.

40
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:07,750
It's called Dynamic widgets.

41
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:15,330
80000 plus active installations and it lets you dynamically show or hide widgets on WordPress pages

42
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:20,910
It works real well and is a free plug in within the Wordpress repository.

43
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,200
Here's a challenge for you.

44
00:05:24,230 --> 00:05:32,690
Back in our home page I want you remember that I made a five widget widget area and I changed it to

45
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,860
We went through and we left a single widget in this front page for widget area.

46
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:52,790
Your challenge is to replace the three home page background images with three images that we just imported

47
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:54,410
into our new site.

48
00:05:54,440 --> 00:05:56,410
Good luck.

49
00:05:56,460 --> 00:05:58,220
That should have been easy enough for you.

50
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:00,180
But here's how I would do it.

51
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:14,940
images so I've clicked background images and I can see that I've got three background images here and

52
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:28,350
third I'll refresh the page and our site is really starting to look customized now.

53
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:42,260
Now down in this front page for widget area I'd like to put all of our photograph categories as links

54
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:53,200
is now before I do that.

55
00:06:53,210 --> 00:06:56,870
I'm going to look up on my desktop here under demo content.

56
00:06:57,080 --> 00:07:00,950
The cafe pro Genesis layout configuration.

57
00:07:01,100 --> 00:07:07,910
So open the cafe pro layouts document again and I want to make sure that by showing four different widgets

58
00:07:11,990 --> 00:07:12,260
Great.

59
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:22,480
two three four in a nice four widget grid.

60
00:07:22,630 --> 00:07:30,010
So I'll show you how I go about creating one photo type category widget and placing it in here.

61
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:35,590
And then your challenge will be to create all four for our four photo categories.

62
00:07:41,710 --> 00:07:53,260
as we make them and I'm going to go and click widgets I'm going to be focusing on that's the front page

63
00:07:53,380 --> 00:07:59,640
for widget which right now is is containing one text widget.

64
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:06,940
I can continue to just use that text widget and I'm going to change the content so maybe I just call

65
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:16,000
And in the content area one of the things I'm going to do is put a little description.

66
00:08:16,010 --> 00:08:23,660
So I'm going to use a little Lorem of some text here I've grabbed just a single sentence of Lorem if

67
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:33,200
If I paste it just within the content area I will show how much text I might have of course these are

68
00:08:38,960 --> 00:08:41,990
So I don't have to worry about how wide that is at the moment.

69
00:08:43,010 --> 00:08:44,770
So what else do I need here.

70
00:08:44,810 --> 00:08:50,650
We need to have something that's clickable to the dog category page or photo type page.

71
00:08:50,840 --> 00:08:59,150
Well first I'll just automatically add paragraphs Yes and I'll put two line breaks and then I'm going

72
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:03,400
Are a couple of little arrows.

73
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:10,700
Piece of text and I know that that needs to be a link to the category page so it'll be easy enough for

74
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:22,580
I know that if I go to a slash photographs I can find the photographs and you know I need to go to and

75
00:09:31,340 --> 00:09:39,170
But that is the URL so I'm hitting Control-C and under my with my read more link here.

76
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:45,740
I really just need to build a little piece of it to your mail to contain that link.

77
00:09:53,150 --> 00:10:01,560
And then I'm hitting control V to paste the URL and then I'm going to end quote and greater than symbol

78
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:13,110
anchor tag by putting a slash a within the tag symbols.

79
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:18,240
There it is there you can see that will be clickable to that category.

80
00:10:18,290 --> 00:10:18,730
Great.

81
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:25,150
One more thing I'd like to put a thumbnail image above the text here that has one of the dog pictures

82
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:29,350
so up here I would do this.

83
00:10:29,910 --> 00:10:32,840
And I'm just going to put a little placeholder here.

84
00:10:32,850 --> 00:10:39,660
Call it dog image and then I've got to arrange what my thumbnail sizes are and find a clickable link

85
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:50,190
So I'm going to save and publish and customize her because I'm going to get out of the Customize her

86
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:57,510
first thing I'm going to do is look at my media settings and I see that I've got a medium size of 600

87
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:04,770
but that's going to be too big a thumbnail size of 300 by 100 which we created before and I really like

88
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:06,900
inside of this cafe pro theme.

89
00:11:07,170 --> 00:11:08,850
So I'm going to use that thumbnail size.

90
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,870
But one thing I want to do is I'm just going to open a random page.

91
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,820
In fact I'm actually going to just create a new page that I'm not going to use for anything and I'm

92
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:29,910
Let's see what's a cool dog picture that could be cropped.

93
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:35,960
And I'm going to choose the 300 by 100 thumbnail.

94
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:40,510
I'm going to make it link to a custom You are RL and that you are.

95
00:11:40,530 --> 00:11:45,100
I'm going to paste which is our photo type slash dogs.

96
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:46,070
You are.

97
00:11:46,350 --> 00:11:52,650
And I also want it to be centered so I'm going to insert that into the page which is making my image

98
00:11:52,860 --> 00:11:54,920
the way that I want it and clickable.

99
00:11:54,940 --> 00:12:01,950
And now if I hit the text tab at the top right of my content area I can grab that entire anchor tag

100
00:12:08,340 --> 00:12:14,760
create a widget image links and save this as a draft that will be published on the web site but I can

101
00:12:20,820 --> 00:12:26,640
Well now that I've copied it to the clipboard I'm going to go back to appearance customize and I'll

102
00:12:33,420 --> 00:12:36,400
Scroll down so I can see my results.

103
00:12:38,310 --> 00:12:45,720
Instead of dog image I'm going to put that piece of text that I copied and paste it right there.

104
00:12:46,350 --> 00:12:53,640
Now I can see that image will be nicely arranged in a widget that's half this width great.

105
00:12:53,700 --> 00:13:01,090
So let's make this year challenge follow the instructions that I just gave you and create 4 widgets

106
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:07,750
that can sit inside the front page for widget area and flush out the home page with links to the four

107
00:13:10,600 --> 00:13:13,050
Good luck How did it go.

108
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,070
Read more link.

109
00:13:18,300 --> 00:13:29,820
Well you could go back into your saved image links page and by using a visual editor like go to another

110
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:41,820
And if I want to type read more and my two arrows select that click add a link and then I could copy

111
00:13:44,930 --> 00:13:47,970
Paste it in there click apply.

112
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:56,520
And now when I go to the text editing I can get that piece of text copy it and then place it under the

113
00:14:04,920 --> 00:14:14,820
at from page 4 and my dog's widget if I replace my hand typed anchor tag with the one that I got from

114
00:14:19,750 --> 00:14:27,280
Just to show you my process as I create the last widget in my front page for widget area here's my widget

115
00:14:27,310 --> 00:14:30,510
image links page that I'm using to get my code.

116
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:36,550
I've got the four thumbnails for each of the categories that I want to use and the read more link done

117
00:14:37,840 --> 00:14:39,770
Well here's the text version.

118
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:48,230
So for my last widget I first need to get copying that code for the image and I have widgets appear

119
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:50,720
it's widgets open in another tab.

120
00:14:50,980 --> 00:14:58,840
So I can go down here and I'm creating my last one called Still Life paste that there hit automatically

121
00:15:00,010 --> 00:15:05,980
So two carriage returns right there and I can just go back here and I can actually go to my Lorem if

122
00:15:06,040 --> 00:15:11,120
some page hit copy and copy that into the middle.

123
00:15:11,200 --> 00:15:14,410
Another two enters go back here.

124
00:15:15,110 --> 00:15:22,090
And grab my read more link paste that in there and hit save.

125
00:15:22,160 --> 00:15:24,800
And that's what I've done for all four widgets.

126
00:15:30,620 --> 00:15:39,840
Hopefully yours had a similar look down in front page for nice and looks great.

127
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:52,470
and then here are my landscape posts three pages of them.

128
00:15:52,600 --> 00:15:57,970
And one last check showing the regular recent posts widget in the footer.

129
00:15:58,180 --> 00:16:06,960
But if I click any of my individual photographs as I scroll down and look at it I've got my image my

130
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:14,850
content category and tags and there's my image data for this particular photograph.

131
00:16:15,030 --> 00:16:21,450
In this final video in the chapter you used the custom sidebars pro plugin from WPA you dev to create

132
00:16:24,780 --> 00:16:30,750
And on the home page you replace the default background images and created for text widgets for the

133
00:16:36,350 --> 00:16:40,880
You'll use the author pro plugin for setting up another site with a custom post type.

134
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:46,430
This time taking advantage of the fully featured plugin will explore how studio press has created a

135
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,360
plug in we just used
