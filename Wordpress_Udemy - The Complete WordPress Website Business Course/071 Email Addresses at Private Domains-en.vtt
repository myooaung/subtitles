00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:06.090
In this video you'll be learning about setting up email addresses for web site owners at their own private

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.420
You'll learn about different hosting and server setups and how different server environments need certain

3
00:00:14.010 --> 00:00:19.470
Sometimes e-mail should be managed at a different server than the Web site itself and you'll learn when

4
00:00:19.530 --> 00:00:20.630
and how to do it.

5
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:26.670
You'll know what's needed for setting up new email addresses changing the DNS so that the domain points

6
00:00:26.760 --> 00:00:32.820
e-mails to the right place and about incorporating existing email addresses into the web site using

7
00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:34.850
Let's get started.

8
00:00:35.980 --> 00:00:43.660
Let's look at a site I own at Greg Davis dot com within its See panel that I have at the site Ground

9
00:00:43.870 --> 00:00:52.210
hosting account inside the see panel I've gone to the home page now of the control panel and one of

10
00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:59.640
And let's just look at e-mail accounts and how they're controlled inside of the panel.

11
00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:08.470
Now if I were using site ground for my e-mail accounts I could just add another e-mail address right

12
00:01:08.890 --> 00:01:15.490
Choose a password and choose a mailbox quota and click Create account.

13
00:01:23.950 --> 00:01:31.690
that email would work and I can then set up an email client or log in to webmail via any browser and

14
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:35.380
I could use an email address at my private domain name.

15
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:44.860
Now I don't use site ground for managing my email addresses at Gray Davis dot com and I've mentioned

16
00:01:45.910 --> 00:01:54.490
But I use the Rackspace apps email provider to control email addresses where I want a little bit more

17
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:09.550
If I look under mailboxes at the Rackspace app's control panel you can see that I've got several domain

18
00:02:17.230 --> 00:02:28.150
Rackspace for email is that you get 25 gigabytes for storage of emails and attachments with your email

19
00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:36.340
Now if we go back to the control panel you can see that by default the control panel urges us to use

20
00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:44.860
Now it's a good idea to do this if you choose unlimited for an email address.

21
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:48.680
It's possible depending on how the client uses email.

22
00:02:48.820 --> 00:02:53.560
You might fill up your allocated storage inside of your web site's server.

23
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:02.560
than the Web site itself.

24
00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:09.900
Behind the scenes of this setup I can show you how the DNS records for the domain name.

25
00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:17.990
Greg Davis dot com differ from if I was holding my email at the web server I need to point certain DNS

26
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:25.600
Greg Davis dot com.

27
00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:33.380
Go to the Rackspace email servers and those entries inside of DNS records are called MX entries their

28
00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:46.580
Now if I look at Greg Davis dot com you can see that I'm using a remote mail exchanger set so that when

29
00:03:46.670 --> 00:03:54.800
the domain points email or web traffic to Gray Davis dot com one of the things that it does it uses

30
00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.380
name servers.

31
00:03:56.420 --> 00:04:04.100
If you look at my site Ground account you can see that my DNS name servers are a private location inside

32
00:04:06.440 --> 00:04:12.920
Now I'm the only one that uses these name servers because I have all my client sites as I've shown you

33
00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:28.040
However when my domain registrar go daddy points all web traffic towards siker round I need to change

34
00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:32.970
the MX records inside of my subpanel for Gray Davis duck.

35
00:04:33.410 --> 00:04:41.660
So I've got a remote mail exchanger selected here and I added two MX records recommended by Rackspace

36
00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:43.370
over here.

37
00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:51.130
Now the recommended MX records to point mail at the Rackspace servers as you can see our M-x one dot

38
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:55.790
email server dot com and MX to the email server dot com.

39
00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:04.550
server provider that you're using.

40
00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:21.090
I can see that at Rackspace you know I have a $2 a month charge for every e-mail box that I use that

41
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:27.830
I do set up a client sites at Rackspace.

42
00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:36.520
email from the server as it comes in.

43
00:05:36.810 --> 00:05:43.860
Most of your clients will most likely not need an upgraded service like this but they can use email

44
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:51.540
at the actual server where you host the Web site as long as they have a setting where they limit the

45
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:06.070
clients to set up their email clients like Outlook or Thunderbird from Mozilla.

46
00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:12.000
You coached them to delete the emails off of the server when they come in.

47
00:06:12.150 --> 00:06:17.490
Potentially you can have them keep several thousand emails on the server if they'd like to go back and

48
00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:27.210
But it's a best practice to delete all the emails off the server so it doesn't just continually build

49
00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:37.390
Now at the managed WordPress hosting company flywheel that I highly recommend and use for my high end

50
00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:50.710
It's a real positive piece of advice that they do not host email because they believe in working with

51
00:06:54.580 --> 00:07:01.750
That just means that they are really good at hosting Web sites and HTP traffic but they don't specialize

52
00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:08.200
in being an email provider and so they recommend that you point your DNS at an external e-mail provider

53
00:07:08.410 --> 00:07:10.600
like I've been talking about in this video.

54
00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:14.490
And they do recommend Google Apps which has a charge for it.

55
00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:22.240
Zoho mail which actually has free e-mail for up to 25 users per domain name and then Rackspace email

56
00:07:28.020 --> 00:07:34.860
Now I do use Zoho mail for several of my clients because it's free to setup and you can point your DNS

57
00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:45.220
at Zoho mal.

58
00:07:45.370 --> 00:07:52.390
You'll find if you research it that the highest end and the more expensive managed WordPress hosts recommend

59
00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:58.720
hosting your email externally from the web site instead of having it hosted at the same place when you're

60
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:07.930
And if you use best practices for setting up email say a shared account at site ground or shared account

61
00:08:12.250 --> 00:08:18.750
Well you are able to set up using best practices so that your server doesn't get filled up and shut

62
00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:26.950
One of the reasons I kept my mail at Rackspace even though I don't host my websites there anymore is

63
00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:34.000
that I had e-mail addresses and aliases set up at Greg Davis dot com for several years before I moved

64
00:08:40.930 --> 00:08:47.380
One of the things that email aliases can do for you is that you can create email addresses to use for

65
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.420
I think what do I have here.

66
00:08:52.480 --> 00:09:00.660
I have 321 different email addresses that are aliases of my Greg Davis e-mail address.

67
00:09:00.670 --> 00:09:08.470
Now each one of these e-mail addresses for example can Tasia at Greg Davis dot com if someone sends

68
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:17.230
However I can't send from that address.

69
00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:25.720
And what this gives me is that if I get spammed or if any of these email addresses get added to a spammers

70
00:09:33.550 --> 00:09:35.800
I will not be getting any spam.

71
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:49.660
I create or use one of these email addresses so that if at any time my e-mail address gets sold or placed

72
00:09:52.660 --> 00:09:58.800
And I never share my real base email address with anyone in the online communities.

73
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:06.670
One of the great things about Rackspace apps and Rackspace email services is that you can have an unlimited

74
00:10:14.340 --> 00:10:17.090
Ground Gray Davis dot com a see panel.

75
00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:22.020
I'll go back home and finish by showing you what e-mail forwarding is about.

76
00:10:22.110 --> 00:10:29.280
If I do have an e-mail address at a private domain like Greg Davis dot com I can set up an email forwarder

77
00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:36.660
which will forward email automatically when sent to an address I create at Greg Davis dot com to any

78
00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:46.350
For example if I have a special e-mail address say Greg at Greg Davis dot com.

79
00:10:46.440 --> 00:10:52.960
But I don't want to set up that email to be checked with Outlook or use the webmail interface.

80
00:10:53.010 --> 00:11:00.300
I can have that email forwarded to my Gmail account for example or my yahoo account that I know I check

81
00:11:01.500 --> 00:11:07.260
I'll often use email forwarding to make it easy on my clients so they can have an email address they

82
00:11:11.310 --> 00:11:16.860
That is a private email address at their domain name but then they want that email to be forwarded and

83
00:11:20.850 --> 00:11:25.860
In this lesson we would have a private domain name email addresses and some of the different ways to

84
00:11:31.530 --> 00:11:37.980
to learn about email hosting for clients DNS and MX records at the domain name and email forwarding

85
00:11:38.670 --> 00:11:39.660
in the next video.

86
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:45.390
We'll go back to setting up systems within WordPress Web sites to take control of transactional email

87
00:11:47.220 --> 00:11:47.730
