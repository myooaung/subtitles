00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.930
In this video you'll go back to your live development site and use a different free plug in to set up

2
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.760
From there you'll expand the functionality to include synchronizing WordPress users with your MailChimp

3
00:00:14.630 --> 00:00:18.910
This system will come in handy for any sites you create which allow registration.

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:24.260
It could be a membership site with protected content or an e-commerce store like the one we'll be setting

5
00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.160
By the end of this lesson you'll have the knowledge to set up and manage marketing lists customer lists

6
00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.120
and user registration through Wordpress and connected to the power of MailChimp for sending bulk email

7
00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.740
back at your Wordpress dashboard.

8
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:44.660
Live site and your Wordpress live site from two videos ago.

9
00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:47.690
I'm going to present you with a challenge right away.

10
00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:57.800
As you recall it's at my web site Greg Davis dot com but it's a separate WordPress installation under

11
00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:07.550
I'm also logged into the dashboard in the background and your challenge is to install a new plug in

12
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:18.010
Now here is the list that I've been working on.

13
00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.870
And you could see it's called Gray Davis notifications.

14
00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:27.370
I did go through and erase all of the subscribers that were just fake subscribers within my list.

15
00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:33.710
But make sure you have your MailChimp account open and open to your list that you're managing inside

16
00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:42.680
If you go back to the Wordpress Web site that we created before this mailing list sign up form is the

17
00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:50.450
If you notice scroll a little bit further down.

18
00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:56.170
And I have a second sign up form for that same list.

19
00:01:56.180 --> 00:02:02.060
Now I set up this sign up form with a different free prologue in from the repository that I've used

20
00:02:04.940 --> 00:02:07.310
Let's go to WordPress dot org.

21
00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:11.530
And under plug ins you can do this within your Wordpress dashboard as well.

22
00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:13.280
But I wanted to show you the name of the plugin.

23
00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:20.340
And at this time it's got more than 700000 active users.

24
00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:23.890
It's by the plug in developer Iberia code.

25
00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:28.290
And here's what it looks like inside the Wordpress repository.

26
00:02:28.310 --> 00:02:36.290
Your challenge is to log into your live WordPress test site go to plug ins and click add new find that

27
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:53.060
website and create another Sign-Up form for that MailChimp list using the API code similar to the way

28
00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.170
Pause the video now and give it a go.

29
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:04.020
I'm sure that went smoothly for you as if you've noticed.

30
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:09.900
You might have seen your selection where you can choose to have the plug in use the styles that are

31
00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.830
You could see that this has the nice blue rollover.

32
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.180
The fonts are the same inside of the form as inside of this 2016 theme.

33
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:29.580
Unlike the MailChimp text widget when we used the specific code for MailChimp it styled itself and so

34
00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:32.620
I'll just go through my steps very quickly.

35
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:41.010
Inside the Wordpress dashboard go to plug ins and I can click Add new and I'll look through these plugins

36
00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:44.590
but I'll just do a search for MailChimp.

37
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:49.170
Just quickly show you what it would look like within the Wordpress dashboard and you probably found

38
00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:57.000
I may have searched for it directly by name but here it is MailChimp for Wordpress by your code and

39
00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:59.480
it's already installed as you can see.

40
00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:09.420
So if I go under their settings panel here I can click MailChimp and as I look my API code or API key

41
00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:11.590
is connected already.

42
00:04:11.700 --> 00:04:15.610
Just to review you would have had to go back into your MailChimp account.

43
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:22.620
Maybe you had to look around a little bit but if you go under your name and click account and you can

44
00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:33.600
There you can copy the API key and then paste it into the MailChimp API settings under the MailChimp

45
00:04:39.360 --> 00:04:43.780
then you can go down here and click forms now in forms.

46
00:04:43.790 --> 00:04:48.950
You may have spent a little bit of time figuring out how to make your form say first name and email

47
00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:55.460
I had to place my cursor right here in fact this stuff was not here.

48
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:02.470
field.

49
00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:10.550
It may as well put first name in the placeholder and it's the label called first name and yes I want

50
00:05:11.690 --> 00:05:18.960
And sure I'll wrap it in the paragraph tags just like these other forms are inside the form and there

51
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:24.590
was it just placed it in there for me and I hit the save changes down here at the bottom.

52
00:05:30.890 --> 00:05:32.210
settings right here.

53
00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:38.120
I wanted to go in here and I need to choose which list I want these users to be subscribed to and do

54
00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:46.520
Yes very recommended and I could redirect them to a special thank you page although I just left that

55
00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:50.100
empty to leave it as the MailChimp default.

56
00:05:50.170 --> 00:05:56.030
Then I hit save changes right here and really those were all the changes I needed make inside of the

57
00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.640
Then I went under.

58
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.610
and I just used the MailChimp sign up form widget that is provided by the plug and I brought it over

59
00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:21.760
And as I go up here and you look at the Web site you can see that it used those words for the title

60
00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.230
and then it's styled nicely.

61
00:06:24.250 --> 00:06:25.570
You know it's got me.

62
00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:32.650
I actually had put your first name as the placeholder text and then right here and I did test this form

63
00:06:33.010 --> 00:06:39.460
I filled out to an e-mail address and my name clicked sign up and I had gotten my verification and was

64
00:06:39.550 --> 00:06:41.380
opted into the list.

65
00:06:42.610 --> 00:06:43.990
And really nothing new.

66
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:47.580
Just using a different plug in at this time.

67
00:06:47.620 --> 00:06:53.310
Let's take a look at how we might register users as subscribers to this Web site.

68
00:06:53.380 --> 00:07:00.100
Even though we don't have a membership or an e-commerce plug in activated yet we can still allow new

69
00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:03.600
users to register an account on our WordPress site.

70
00:07:03.610 --> 00:07:09.310
Now they won't be administrators but we can just give them the default roll of subscriber and then they'll

71
00:07:14.770 --> 00:07:16.960
site password.

72
00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:25.170
And so back in the Wordpress dashboard one thing we can do under settings and under general is look

73
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:37.950
box that says anyone can register and for new users their default role will just be subscriber.

74
00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:45.870
to be activated.

75
00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:50.850
So anyone can click register and find and register for the Web site.

76
00:07:50.910 --> 00:07:55.820
So I'll just leave that box checked and click save changes.

77
00:07:55.870 --> 00:08:02.950
Now how can I find the registration page fact let's just experiment here if I log out.

78
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:10.420
We can see that the log in form page comes up and it's at you know whatever you are is slash W.P. dash

79
00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:20.350
And if you see now that I've checked that users can register in addition to the last year password link.

80
00:08:26.710 --> 00:08:31.980
a little piece on the end of the URL that has action equals register.

81
00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:35.950
So if I click that I can register a new user.

82
00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:41.470
So I'm going is going to choose a random username and an e-mail address.

83
00:08:46.900 --> 00:08:52.840
And so if you have a separate e-mail address use that one or create a new e-mail address at gmail or

84
00:08:56.110 --> 00:09:02.820
So I'm just going to use my testing e-mail address that I know I have and I'll click the register button.

85
00:09:03.010 --> 00:09:06.880
Now it says registration complete Please check your e-mail.

86
00:09:06.910 --> 00:09:12.250
Now there might be more complex registration systems for customers of an e-commerce site like we're

87
00:09:19.240 --> 00:09:23.630
system that comes with Wordpress is pretty simple and it works well.

88
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.650
Get you verify that the person is a real person by having them check their email and then confirming

89
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:37.970
and choosing their password so over in my email program I receive this email just a simple welcome and

90
00:09:38.110 --> 00:09:42.420
click this first URL that it gives me to set my password.

91
00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:49.540
So it opens up a page where it's going to give me a nice strong password or I can type in a simple one.

92
00:09:56.500 --> 00:10:03.180
remember the password of the new user and I can click reset password and there we go.

93
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:05.940
Then it gives you a nice log in button.

94
00:10:05.950 --> 00:10:09.060
Now again here's the log in page.

95
00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:16.990
So if I use the log in and password that I was just given I log in as a new user.

96
00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:23.050
You can see that I don't have all of the Wordpress administration links and menu items on the left hand

97
00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:25.520
I just have a profile page.

98
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:30.100
I can change things like my password and my profile information.

99
00:10:35.170 --> 00:10:36.440
Dashboard widgets.

100
00:10:36.610 --> 00:10:39.310
But I don't have any of the controls over the site.

101
00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:49.420
We'll give those users special permissions for certain places like check out or for protected content

102
00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:57.930
So one of the great things you can do with this plug in or with another MailChimp integration plug in

103
00:11:05.460 --> 00:11:11.730
wordpress site you can actually let them join your MailChimp list and get double opted into the email

104
00:11:18.390 --> 00:11:20.100
And so it's very convenient.

105
00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:34.880
synchronization inside of my dashboard or log back in as the administrator and I go over here and look

106
00:11:42.110 --> 00:11:42.620
I put in.

107
00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:57.110
Now if I go under MailChimp for WP and I look at integrations one of the things that it offers as a

108
00:12:02.630 --> 00:12:08.720
So you could ask them if they'd like to join the MailChimp list or join to get the newsletter.

109
00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:13.730
Anytime somebody either fills out the registration form or a comment form.

110
00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:20.000
And so if we activate the registration form integration it'll bring up a settings page for that and

111
00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:30.260
And I do want to ask them if they want to subscribe using a checkbox and so I click no here and then

112
00:12:33.830 --> 00:12:36.580
I want to choose that specific list.

113
00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:42.740
Sign me up for the newsletter is fine for now we're just testing this integration and this user synchronization

114
00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.100
and then let's have the checkbox pre-selected let's just leave the regular default settings here.

115
00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:55.990
And I don't want need to do anything for existing subscribers at this point.

116
00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:05.560
So if I just hit save changes now as I have this MailChimp settings integrated because I have set up

117
00:13:13.750 --> 00:13:22.450
my MailChimp list right now if I go to lists in my MailChimp account and I'll go down and choose the

118
00:13:25.150 --> 00:13:29.200
You can see that I've got zero subscribers as I showed before.

119
00:13:34.150 --> 00:13:41.350
So if I want to register a new user if you need to you can log in and look at the users and delete the

120
00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:51.430
But you can see this register page now slightly different it's got a checkbox which says Sign me up

121
00:13:55.630 --> 00:13:58.090
And of course that will be coming from MailChimp.

122
00:13:58.450 --> 00:14:04.300
So great if I just create another user you can delete that old user if you're going to reuse this email

123
00:14:04.810 --> 00:14:16.150
but I'll use my other e-mail that I have Cobbe testing to get Greg Davis and let's register this user

124
00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.110
great registration complete Please check your email.

125
00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:30.920
If I go to my email and let's see if I look under my e-mail address and click get messages.

126
00:14:31.130 --> 00:14:33.780
I should have two different e-mails now.

127
00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:41.060
So I have my regular e-mail that came in from WordPress but I also have my e-mail confirmation opt in.

128
00:14:42.680 --> 00:14:47.710
So if I just click yes subscribe me to this list I'll go to that default.

129
00:14:47.720 --> 00:14:49.730
Thank you page.

130
00:14:49.790 --> 00:14:52.280
Excellent that's what we tested a couple of videos ago.

131
00:14:52.430 --> 00:14:59.030
And if I go back to my MailChimp account now if I refresh the page you can see it's going to add that

132
00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:05.660
There's the e-mail address testing to Greg Davis dot com.

133
00:15:05.870 --> 00:15:07.010
And excellent.

134
00:15:16.190 --> 00:15:19.280
let's just take a look at our users here users.

135
00:15:21.370 --> 00:15:23.050
Now I've got three users.

136
00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:38.290
verify and get my passwords so this user won't be able to log in until they go ahead and get their password.

137
00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:42.900
But that new user is or is also a user on the account.

138
00:15:43.030 --> 00:15:48.520
But if you look back in MailChimp they're not actually on the mailing list because we just activated

139
00:15:55.130 --> 00:16:01.490
Not only just MailChimp for Wordpress allow you to register users on your MailChimp list through registering

140
00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:07.160
in wordpress but it can also synchronize a little more powerfully through some synchronizations and

141
00:16:07.190 --> 00:16:10.400
add on plugins that they offer for free as well.

142
00:16:10.460 --> 00:16:15.690
The MailChimp user sync plug in is one you can get for free from the repository.

143
00:16:15.830 --> 00:16:22.070
And once it's installed gives you the option within the settings of MailChimp for Wordpress to synchronize

144
00:16:22.160 --> 00:16:24.050
via a synchronized button.

145
00:16:30.230 --> 00:16:35.540
through your wordpress site and you can have back and forth users synchronization so that when people

146
00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:45.450
from the Wordpress installation as well.

147
00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.530
In this lesson you used a free plug in to integrate user accounts in wordpress with a MailChimp email

148
00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:58.340
I'm sure you can see the power of setting it up like this for sites that allow users to register.

149
00:16:58.350 --> 00:17:03.690
It allows you to properly send e-mail to a large group and build that email list through your Wordpress

150
00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.650
Speaking of user accounts in wordpress in the next chapter we'll be setting up an e-commerce Web store

151
00:17:10.800 --> 00:17:15.450
which will be allowing registration and tracking of customers through WordPress.

152
00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:21.120
We'll be bringing concepts from several past chapters in this course to light through building our store.
