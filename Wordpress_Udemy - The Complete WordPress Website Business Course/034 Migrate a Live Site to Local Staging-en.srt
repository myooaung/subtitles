00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:06,000
In this video you'll set up a new local development environment and then migrate a copy of the live

2
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,230
in the local staging area.

3
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,600
Then upload the new version to the live server.

4
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,610
In this way the updates will be instant with no downtime for the live site.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:27,990
You'll learn how to safely edit a live web site without risk of damaging or losing the live site and

6
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,770
without your changes visible to the public during your process.

7
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:38,530
a safety net.

8
00:00:38,580 --> 00:00:45,620
If something goes wrong let's start by making a quick edit to our site that's live on the internet.

9
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:52,960
Whichever hosting service you used and I'll just go back into the dashboard where I'm logged in and

10
00:00:52,990 --> 00:01:00,150
I'm going to go ahead and choose settings general and just go and change the title of the site as a

11
00:01:01,740 --> 00:01:11,780
This one is live at flywheel so I scroll scroll down and just click Save changes and if I refresh the

12
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:24,170
Now here's a challenge once again create a new WordPress installation and activate it in localhost.

13
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:26,810
Start map if you don't have it already.

14
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:28,290
Copy the files over.

15
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,970
site into it.

16
00:01:37,150 --> 00:01:38,640
I hope that went well for you.

17
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:47,310
I installed mine under map and I called it live Dasch site.

18
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:55,140
Now that I've installed WordPress I can populate that and refresh it and under W.P. options.

19
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:03,950
Great.

20
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:06,750
And I bet you can guess your next challenge.

21
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:24,550
and import it into your live site locally and make the two sites complete duplicates of each other.

22
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:28,490
Has a video now and give it a go.

23
00:02:28,700 --> 00:02:32,440
This time I will demonstrate going through the process.

24
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:42,000
So here's my live site and over here is my site on flywheel so I've got all in one WP migration.

25
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:50,160
I'm going to do an export to file great that's created my downloadable backup and I'll click download

26
00:02:50,610 --> 00:02:55,220
and save it to the downloads folder.

27
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:58,090
Here it is.

28
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:05,120
Open up my downloads and in Windows Explorer I can go to my live site folder.

29
00:03:11,960 --> 00:03:19,690
This one is called Live site and it's just seperate from that map installation place.

30
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:23,310
Download backup right there.

31
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:23,690
Great.

32
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:33,760
This is my local development area or you might call a staging site.

33
00:03:34,780 --> 00:03:42,140
And I'm going to install the all in one WP migration plug in as before

34
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,510
and I'll import the backup that I just made from the life site.

35
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:05,340
Looks like it's important I'll click continue on the warning

36
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:13,000
great.

37
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:22,590
I'm going to go over to the permalink settings and click twice to save those as the plug and instructs

38
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:33,300
of course we've got to log in again once we've uploaded and and restored a site from backup because

39
00:04:41,990 --> 00:04:44,420
And then one more time as the plugin instructs

40
00:04:48,610 --> 00:04:52,020
and let's take a look right click open in a new tab

41
00:04:55,090 --> 00:05:02,110
looks like the site is the same exact copy fire lead photography live looks like everything's working

42
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:06,380
Great.

43
00:05:06,430 --> 00:05:15,090
So what we have here is a perfect copy in our local environment of the site that is live up on the Internet

44
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:17,110
right now.

45
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:22,320
What that means is that when you're working on your local development environment you can change the

46
00:05:28,950 --> 00:05:31,680
you're working on it no one can see your changes.

47
00:05:38,710 --> 00:05:47,220
like this with a totally new theme and revised footer widgets and everything you could do that while

48
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:56,130
One minute they'll be looking at the old site next minute when they reload it or somebody new comes

49
00:05:56,940 --> 00:05:57,630
It's brand new.

50
00:05:57,660 --> 00:05:58,620
No downtime.

51
00:06:00,670 --> 00:06:05,500
In this video you've set up an entire local development environment for staging working copies of a

52
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:11,110
And you migrated to an exact copy into your staging environment.

53
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,120
the theme and editing some of the content areas.

54
00:06:20,230 --> 00:06:22,340
Then you'll take your new design life.

55
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,310
Let's do it.
