00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:06.390
In this video we'll make sure you understand the custom post type that newcomer's uses as well as the

2
00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:13.650
chapters.

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:20.010
The newcomers products custom post type allows for the organization of data separate from the Wordpress

4
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:27.210
By the end of this video you'll understand how to work with the newcomers custom post type and why it

5
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:34.700
This will enable you to customize the plug in if you need to for any WordPress e-commerce project.

6
00:00:34.890 --> 00:00:41.520
In the last video we took a quick look at the products page and we looked at a single product.

7
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:55.740
post or page every page on the web site gives you an opportunity to control how it functions with the

8
00:00:57.030 --> 00:01:03.300
For now just to get that out of our way you can close the little tab by pushing that up a little bit

9
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.280
So if you look at the different parts under one of the products.

10
00:01:22.900 --> 00:01:30.370
taxonomy in that you can have something like Hoodie's which is under clothing you've got a parent and

11
00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:42.300
And so there's categories and then there's product tags as well which is a non hierarchical taxonomy.

12
00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:49.630
You got an image and then it does offer a gallery so you can put a product gallery of a multiple set

13
00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:04.480
And so each of the products in the custom post type can have its own set of images defined and then

14
00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.370
And so what else did we have right down here.

15
00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:15.610
We have a product short description.

16
00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:27.740
But if you remember when we went over this section before we've got the product which is the custom

17
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:42.850
And then if we look at attributes attributes just like categories it's a hierarchical taxonomy and it

18
00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:52.930
So Ill be able to list what color you can define what type or what attribute the product you're buying

19
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:54.280
should have.

20
00:02:54.550 --> 00:02:59.260
And so it's got an attribute settings page you can create a new one you know.

21
00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:13.990
And in another way you can see that when you click on one of them it actually gives you an opportunity

22
00:03:21.130 --> 00:03:25.010
us an opportunity to choose a parent taxonomy for it.

23
00:03:25.150 --> 00:03:26.620
So parents and child.

24
00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:41.780
And as you can see there are some sections that have custom fields.

25
00:03:41.850 --> 00:03:48.730
There it is now at the bottom here the custom field section is called product data and it has a number

26
00:03:53.620 --> 00:04:01.060
If we click attributes we can actually select a custom product attribute and add it right here or we

27
00:04:03.130 --> 00:04:09.700
So if this attribute if this product could have more than one attribute might have some different colors.

28
00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:13.530
You can then add that to that product itself.

29
00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:17.420
And there's a few more that will go over later in this video.

30
00:04:17.440 --> 00:04:23.980
There's also a product a short description I made a quick change and I labeled the short description

31
00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.650
under this product that we're looking at right here.

32
00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:33.170
The short description under the Wu album number two.

33
00:04:33.190 --> 00:04:36.430
And so I'm actually looking at the flying Ninja.

34
00:04:40.270 --> 00:04:40.690
Oops.

35
00:04:40.750 --> 00:04:42.700
That's the home page that I have to find here.

36
00:04:51.030 --> 00:04:54.010
And I might have to go to the next page.

37
00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.330
The shop pages have a pagination.

38
00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:06.470
Or you can click the whole listing really to look at the product page itself.

39
00:05:06.630 --> 00:05:13.050
And I can see that I have put a short description down here under that product I put the word short

40
00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:21.310
So the short description is the one right next to the item right here.

41
00:05:21.570 --> 00:05:27.510
And as you scroll down you can see that the full product description is right here so you can leave

42
00:05:30.030 --> 00:05:35.470
And you can have the short description kind of even with the small image right up here.

43
00:05:36.660 --> 00:05:41.160
Another couple of things as you scroll down a little bit next to this product description.

44
00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:55.860
e-commerce plugin is the ability for it to use a revues system that's separate from the Wordpress commenting

45
00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:10.590
to give it a star rating and to write a review right here and then to submit that review and those reviews

46
00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.200
can come up and be published on the site itself.

47
00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:20.580
So somebody browsing the product can look at the description and then can get some social proof or some

48
00:06:26.790 --> 00:06:33.000
Let's go back to the shop page and let's take a look at this flying ninja poster.

49
00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:41.640
And just as I noticed down here at the bottom when you go down and look below the actual image there's

50
00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:50.340
So if you click the image will give it a lightbox display word enlarges the image and then it shows

51
00:06:57.390 --> 00:06:59.520
that's associated with this product.

52
00:06:59.670 --> 00:07:07.320
And that's an example that we were looking at before of having a gallery product gallery down underneath

53
00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.720
So let's just take a look at that.

54
00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:17.560
We look at the products page again and let's scroll down and look at this flying ninja product which

55
00:07:26.050 --> 00:07:27.620
Scroll down a little bit.

56
00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:31.210
Right we've got an initial product image right here.

57
00:07:31.320 --> 00:07:38.150
And then there's another image down under the gallery so you can add product gallery images and that'll

58
00:07:38.190 --> 00:07:43.100
enable your product page to show multiple images of the same product.

59
00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.140
Let's take a look at the rest of our custom fields.

60
00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.810
Inside one of the product pages and just identify what they are.

61
00:07:51.850 --> 00:07:55.560
So in the general tab here this is under product data.

62
00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:02.650
We're either offering a simple product a grouped product an external or affiliate product meaning that

63
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:10.680
to be getting an affiliate commission on that product.

64
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:16.310
And then a variable product is something different that we can look up its more advanced insight of

65
00:08:16.470 --> 00:08:17.400
Commerce.

66
00:08:17.740 --> 00:08:23.980
Here's an example of using the excellent commerce documentation and just this documentation page and

67
00:08:28.630 --> 00:08:33.910
I've got a page called variable product and it's a product type in which commerce it lets you offer

68
00:08:40.550 --> 00:08:47.110
And inside the documentation they have a nice intro three minute and 52 second video which would be

69
00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:54.910
another type of product.

70
00:08:55.030 --> 00:08:56.810
Let's keep this a simple product.

71
00:08:57.040 --> 00:09:04.090
And there's also the virtual and the downloadable checkboxes here and we'll be using these specifically

72
00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:11.800
And there's a description under these when you roll your mouse over it.

73
00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:26.110
commerce plugin will take care of downloads and private access to the files that you want to give people

74
00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:28.080
once they're purchased.

75
00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:32.920
And so you can also see that there's a regular price and a sale price.

76
00:09:32.980 --> 00:09:36.250
And if there's a sale price you can actually set a schedule.

77
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:49.820
scheduled sale and then it will come off of the sale automatically when the date comes up.

78
00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:57.920
Under inventory you can use your Wordpress e-commerce store to manage how much inventory is left.

79
00:09:57.940 --> 00:10:04.330
For instance if someone buys the last product in your inventory list it will disable sales for that

80
00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:13.910
Shipping is obvious it gives you the shipping information for each of your products if you have size

81
00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:24.030
Calculate your shipping costs and charge the customer linked.

82
00:10:24.050 --> 00:10:29.220
Products are about having like a grouped product here under the product type.

83
00:10:29.330 --> 00:10:31.380
And so if you link certain products.

84
00:10:31.580 --> 00:10:38.890
If somebody buys this product and you want to offer them the next higher cost type of product that's

85
00:10:38.900 --> 00:10:44.930
like that you can choose to do and up upscale across sell is a product that's similar but maybe in a

86
00:10:52.070 --> 00:10:56.290
products that you might want to sell together attributes.

87
00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:02.280
We talked about like as in the color of a shirt or a sweatshirt something like that.

88
00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:09.260
And then under advanced There's a few more you have a purchased note for this particular product a menu

89
00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:22.610
number and then you can either enable or disable the reviews tab that we went over on the products page

90
00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:24.500
a little bit earlier.

91
00:11:24.590 --> 00:11:32.150
Now I'm sure you can see that if I had given you the challenge to create an e-commerce store with one

92
00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:46.640
required and the custom fields for all of these items and then figure out how to display all of that

93
00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:49.880
in a nice looking way on your theme.

94
00:11:50.060 --> 00:11:53.730
Well that would have been a big undertaking.

95
00:11:53.970 --> 00:12:01.600
The Commerce e-commerce plug in gives us all this stuff pre-built and it even works in almost any theme.

96
00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:06.200
So the last thing we'll do in this video is just make a couple of fundamental changes just to start

97
00:12:06.350 --> 00:12:08.450
trimming up our store a little bit.

98
00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:12.820
And the first one is let's change the name of our store if you haven't done that already.

99
00:12:12.890 --> 00:12:14.670
And the tag.

100
00:12:14.750 --> 00:12:18.650
And so if you can remember where to change the name and the tagline.

101
00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:22.660
Pause the video now and go ahead and do that.

102
00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:28.940
I'll just go back to the dashboard and I might as well go into the appearance customize her so that

103
00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:38.450
So site identity is where we have a logo as well as the site title and the tag line.

104
00:12:50.270 --> 00:12:56.470
products for you with an exclamation point and I'll publish that change.

105
00:13:00.730 --> 00:13:08.890
First customize this menu and make sure that it shows whatever you think the menu items should be up

106
00:13:09.880 --> 00:13:16.230
For instance we use that thank you for confirming page for our MailChimp configuration.

107
00:13:16.240 --> 00:13:22.030
And of course if we do have a MailChimp sign up as a part of our website or we don't want to just publish

108
00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.720
We'd want to hide that from the menu.

109
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:40.350
site is actually the shop has a video now and give it a go that went well for you I'll show you how

110
00:13:46.110 --> 00:13:47.590
those two changes.

111
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:56.460
First I'll go into menus and menu locations and it looks like this is just a default menu showing every

112
00:14:00.600 --> 00:14:00.930
Let's see.

113
00:14:03.510 --> 00:14:10.680
Let's add a menu and I'm just going to call it the Hederman and you as I usually do and click create

114
00:14:18.300 --> 00:14:19.920
in this storefront theme.

115
00:14:20.190 --> 00:14:21.150
But I can test that.

116
00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.460
then I'm going to add items to this menu.

117
00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:39.810
For instance let's see if I go down here and look at pages I do want to put the home page and here it

118
00:14:39.960 --> 00:14:41.430
Changing it as I watch.

119
00:14:43.050 --> 00:14:49.540
And I do and I have a button for my account and I would like to have a cart.

120
00:14:49.600 --> 00:14:53.400
A shopping cart ready for users to use.

121
00:14:53.730 --> 00:15:00.000
I think home is actually going to be the shop so I might just leave that blank or leave it off and maybe

122
00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:07.540
So I'll leave it to those four and I'll click save and publish.

123
00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.380
And now the second thing I want to do is change the home page itself.

124
00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:18.370
So if I go back over to here I can see it's a static front page and I don't want it to be the latest

125
00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:25.390
I want it to be a static page and I'm a choose that shop page as my front page.

126
00:15:26.020 --> 00:15:29.020
Now just click save and publish.

127
00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:31.410
And I think I'm all set.

128
00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:41.200
So if I go back to the site in my tab I just click the home page here which goes to the base.

129
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:44.170
Now I can tell that that is the shop page.

130
00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:44.890
Great.

131
00:15:47.830 --> 00:15:49.630
And let's leave it at that.

132
00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:57.130
In this lesson you explored the newcomers custom post-time which is called products and it's associated

133
00:16:01.300 --> 00:16:05.260
You also check out all the custom fields options for each product.

134
00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:15.790
Adding some specific web store type displays like multiple images for a given product and the product

135
00:16:17.410 --> 00:16:24.940
Also nice job customizing the title tag line and menu items in the next video will explore and customize

136
00:16:29.470 --> 00:16:35.920
These are all dynamically generated pages that display different data depending on who's logged in.

137
00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.380
site.

138
00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:48.880
In that it creates user accounts in wordpress and allows visitors to maintain a profile a purchase history

139
00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:50.770
and log in credentials.
