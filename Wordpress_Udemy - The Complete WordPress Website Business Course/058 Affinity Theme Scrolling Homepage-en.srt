00:00:00,680 --> 00:00:06,080
In this video I'll show you how I went about following the affinity themes instructions at Wordpress

2
00:00:09,980 --> 00:00:15,270
Hopefully you were successful at setting it all up at your own local development environment website.

3
00:00:15,530 --> 00:00:22,100
Regardless here's the steps I took this lesson reveals how I changed the home page of our affinity themed

4
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:35,790
Remember before you can navigate to your local host your URL you have to activate map and make sure

5
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:47,570
When I navigate to the Wordpress dashboard I can see that I've got a few updates ready for me.

6
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:52,610
Let's look at the updates page under dashboard and I'll see what I have going on.

7
00:00:56,150 --> 00:01:02,650
That's one update that I can do great and I know that there's one more so if I return to the Wordpress

8
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,730
updates page I can see that it's actually the affinity theme.

9
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:10,970
Now if you remember and you still have the same setup.

10
00:01:11,110 --> 00:01:17,870
We probably have one of the two child themes that we set up in previous lessons activated.

11
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:26,530
So I still have the affinity child too which was the one formed by that plug in called Child configurator

12
00:01:26,980 --> 00:01:34,770
and affinity child one is still here but it's the affinity theme it has an update available.

13
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,250
That's fine because any of the changes that we made to the functions that ph profile were done inside

14
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:47,580
It looks like a small update.

15
00:01:58,120 --> 00:02:03,580
Let's go back to our site that I have open in another tab and refresh.

16
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,810
I just make sure that everything is working well.

17
00:02:06,850 --> 00:02:09,690
Nice looks good.

18
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:15,690
Now this has the recent blog posts as the home page which were going to be changing and if we scroll

19
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:24,840
white instead of gray is still there.

20
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:40,590
has a style sheet and just a theme functions functions that BHP file and in the style sheet is where

21
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,010
of gray.

22
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:55,370
One last change that I made before we get to editing our home page panels is.

23
00:02:55,510 --> 00:03:02,020
I went in under appearance header and you can change this in the customize or which is going to open

24
00:03:10,330 --> 00:03:14,930
the theme I just chose one of the images inside the theme.

25
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,780
I'm not really changing it so I can close out that.

26
00:03:25,460 --> 00:03:30,570
I'm actually making a change here and let's get to changing our home page.

27
00:03:30,740 --> 00:03:36,490
From reading the instructions I know that it has to do with pages that we use for those front panels.

28
00:03:36,860 --> 00:03:42,770
If I open the affinity theme page instead of Wordpress dot com you can see that the key information

29
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:48,940
Setting up your front page and it talks about creating a page and then choosing it in the customize

30
00:03:51,230 --> 00:03:57,560
Then you can also have a blog page that can display a list of the latest posts as you scroll down.

31
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:10,190
page and then identifying that page inside of the customize or under theme options.

32
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,200
I'll go back here in looking at my pages.

33
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,840
I know that I have one called front page that was brought in as a part of that import that we made for

34
00:04:24,020 --> 00:04:31,280
It's got just a little bit of content and a page title and so I'll go into the appearance customize

35
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:37,490
or right at the bottom of the customize or is a panel called theme options and you can see I have a

36
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:50,640
If I open general my only selection is the image opacity so that if I use different images say I wanted

37
00:04:53,450 --> 00:04:59,900
I could darken it and have that white copy should show up really well if I have a lot of light images.

38
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:03,470
For now I'll leave it at 70 percent and see how that looks.

39
00:05:07,910 --> 00:05:14,620
I want the home page to scroll behind or do I want it not to.

40
00:05:14,690 --> 00:05:18,380
It doesn't show it in the customize or it said in the instructions here.

41
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,720
so I'm leaving that checked.

42
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:35,640
Now if I choose Panel 1 and Open panel content I can see that I can find my front page now looking at

43
00:05:42,390 --> 00:05:44,900
set up my front page first.

44
00:05:44,910 --> 00:05:52,620
So inside the customize or I can go back into it's the static front page then instead of latest posts

45
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,530
Now if I save and publish that I can look at it inside the custom Mizer I can really see what it looks

46
00:06:13,430 --> 00:06:21,980
when that refreshes you can see that I have the front page content inside of the white panel down below.

47
00:06:22,430 --> 00:06:26,230
Now why do I have two versions of the front page content here.

48
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:34,220
I didn't need to activate that front page inside of the customize or as one of the panels because it's

49
00:06:38,780 --> 00:06:45,110
I want to use a second page and let's just use the About page that we have inside of the system for

50
00:06:49,670 --> 00:06:55,340
So if you look at the demo site as you scroll down you can see they have their front page content and

51
00:07:01,310 --> 00:07:02,660
is in the white area.

52
00:07:04,220 --> 00:07:09,830
So if you follow instructions here you know that it says in order to have a background image you need

53
00:07:13,010 --> 00:07:18,080
Obviously I don't have a featured image in the About page so if I just save and publish this inside

54
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:27,930
Open this about page and assign a nice big background image as the featured image.

55
00:07:27,990 --> 00:07:30,750
So let's go back to all pages.

56
00:07:30,920 --> 00:07:38,450
If I open about I'll just go down to the featured image area on the right hand side and click Set featured

57
00:07:43,900 --> 00:07:46,100
What's that big image that I like.

58
00:07:46,150 --> 00:07:49,420
How big is this on a 6500 pixel image.

59
00:07:57,370 --> 00:07:59,540
the About page.

60
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:06,680
Let's go back to the site and refresh the home page and we'll see if that about page has loaded its

61
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:09,260
background image.

62
00:08:09,270 --> 00:08:12,720
All right I'm scrolling down front page.

63
00:08:12,710 --> 00:08:19,520
There's a beautiful background image and then the content of that about page is down below grade.

64
00:08:19,530 --> 00:08:25,060
I'll go through and activate some more pages as a part of the panel structure here.

65
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:30,870
And you can also see that our diamonds are starting to appear as automatic navigation inside of this

66
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:36,430
OK so how did you get on with that.

67
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:40,690
I chose some different pages and created some different pages.

68
00:08:40,740 --> 00:08:42,810
Adding a featured image to each one.

69
00:08:42,990 --> 00:08:45,770
And now I've got a nice long page here.

70
00:08:45,930 --> 00:08:48,660
If I open up one of the panels

71
00:08:51,420 --> 00:08:53,520
it'll show me which one is which.

72
00:09:01,450 --> 00:09:06,890
that I chose for panel two was a page I had in there I had to create the name sample page.

73
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:14,080
It was already created from our previous lessons but it had an image and it had a black quote here inside

74
00:09:15,010 --> 00:09:19,920
We'll be able to see what that looks like in the site or the rest of em or down here.

75
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:26,630
Let's go ahead and refresh the homepage and take a look at the site.

76
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:30,280
Now I've got all these navigation buttons over here.

77
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:31,740
I can use them.

78
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:34,600
To go down to the next section.

79
00:09:35,700 --> 00:09:40,560
Nice about there was my sample page so I scroll down.

80
00:09:46,130 --> 00:09:46,620
Right.

81
00:09:46,630 --> 00:09:48,470
This one's on another page.

82
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,670
Looks great with those large images.

83
00:09:52,020 --> 00:09:54,010
Here's yet another page.

84
00:09:54,180 --> 00:09:59,850
You can tell that with the taller images they show the whole image.

85
00:09:59,970 --> 00:10:04,530
And if you had a smaller one that was say not quite as tall as this one.

86
00:10:04,590 --> 00:10:06,760
It shows a little bit less of the image.

87
00:10:06,870 --> 00:10:13,380
You could choose in your design process to make an image that's wide like 6500 or 2000 pixels but maybe

88
00:10:23,490 --> 00:10:24,220
rate.

89
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:29,840
And I was just pasting some Lorem some text inside of each page.

90
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:36,140
I open up my wordpress dashboard and close the customize or you'll see this is the last page that I

91
00:10:42,780 --> 00:10:48,180
Now when we go back to here you could see that the navigation has populated itself.

92
00:10:48,210 --> 00:10:53,010
I go back to the top and it goes to the very top of the page.

93
00:10:53,220 --> 00:11:01,410
And we got a really nice functional scrolling home page.

94
00:11:01,450 --> 00:11:06,430
I hope you did well with that challenge by following the theme instructions and creating your own scrolling

95
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:15,400
In the next video we'll go back to the cafe pro theme inside your students sandbox and arrange the home
