00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:06.400
In this video we'll go behind the scenes to see all the plug ins I'm using at W.P. of course dot.com

2
00:00:06.960 --> 00:00:12.280
some plug ins are the premium plug ins that you'll be using as we create more Web sites in the sandbox

3
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:14.200
in the upcoming chapters.

4
00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:21.580
I'm using to manage the Wordpress multi-site installation that powers the students sandbox.

5
00:00:21.910 --> 00:00:27.010
In this lesson you'll begin to see the possible applications for premium plug ins as well as Wordpress

6
00:00:28.150 --> 00:00:29.040
Let's get started.

7
00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:34.640
Lets start by logging in at students dot W.P. of course dot com.

8
00:00:34.770 --> 00:00:42.210
If you're not already you can log in to the button at the upper right and use your own username and

9
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:48.380
log in into your Wordpress dashboard at the student sandbox area.

10
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:54.360
Go ahead and click plug ins and you can browse the plug ins with me.

11
00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:59.600
I'm just going to introduce a few of the premium plug ins in this list that we'll be using in the next

12
00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:09.980
Building web sites and then will transfer over to the WPA dev area inside of the Administrator account

13
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:16.850
WP of course dot com and I'll show you around some of the plugins I'm using to run this multi-site installation

14
00:01:18.540 --> 00:01:24.660
First of all we've played with the contact form 7 plug in a little bit and I mentioned in one of the

15
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:42.650
promotional freebies on their code Kanyon brand at the enviro market will be playing with this in the

16
00:01:45.650 --> 00:01:51.770
Custom presses another one from W PMU death and we'll be talking about that later in this video.

17
00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:00.950
few chapters inside the sandbox.

18
00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.480
Google maps again from WPA.

19
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:14.930
Udev is a premium maps plugin that offers some additional features on top of the one that we've been

20
00:02:17.940 --> 00:02:24.570
Layered pop ups I gave a tour of in one of the previous videos and again this is a pop up plug in that

21
00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:30.550
I've purchased from and Vado market as we scroll down.

22
00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.760
There's a couple of free plug ins here like regenerate thumbnails that will go over in future videos.

23
00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:47.430
You've experienced the soliloquy plug in and all of its add ons in the previous chapter and that's it

24
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:52.230
For now I'll be adding more premium plug ins to this list.

25
00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:09.340
sandbox area and I'm going to go log in to the master super admin account at the WP dev course dot com

26
00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:16.160
and give you a small tour of how I'm using premium plug ins to run this multi-site installation.

27
00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:22.900
This looks very similar to your sandbox site dashboard but I've got of course a few other items that

28
00:03:25.810 --> 00:03:32.500
I'm using the code snippets plugin that I introduce to you in a previous chapter to manage some of the

29
00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:39.780
areas inside of the administration dashboard in the Wordpress multi-site installation.

30
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:50.050
If I go up to the dashboard this is the WP at Dev course site itself but if I rollover this network

31
00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.830
admin drop down and then click dashboard.

32
00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:01.120
This is the network administration dashboard area for the entire multi-site network.

33
00:04:02.280 --> 00:04:07.800
Here you can see that I've got the branding plug in that I went in that I went over earlier with you

34
00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:16.700
up here.

35
00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:26.720
I'm customizing the admin bar by adding a resources button and the WP 101 tutorial videos button up

36
00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:30.950
Using the admin bar add on.

37
00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:39.320
I'm using the text change add on to the branding plug in and I've changed the word howdie the standard

38
00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:50.200
I've also changed the word blog within the entire admin area to the word site.

39
00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.540
In terms of images I have easily added an image to the top of the log in page as you can see over here.

40
00:05:01.590 --> 00:05:03.060
This is a custom image.

41
00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:11.490
They allow you to use the official logos from WordPress for any branding you might be doing.

42
00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:17.230
And I use that as an image inside of the multi-site Sarah.

43
00:05:17.380 --> 00:05:23.890
I'm not using it now but I'm able to use an admin message where I can place that in the administration

44
00:05:28.510 --> 00:05:34.750
So if you ever see a message from me with a little green bar at the top I'm using this admin message

45
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:39.780
add on to the branding plug in in order to deliver that message.

46
00:05:39.880 --> 00:05:44.460
I have eliminated the permalink menu down here.

47
00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:47.690
Under settings Permalink.

48
00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:53.680
For you as the student because I don't want you to be able to change the permalink around inside of

49
00:05:59.780 --> 00:06:06.020
I don't have any custom styles for the admin but I could I could change the colors or brand this a little

50
00:06:11.670 --> 00:06:20.970
In terms of widgets I'm eliminating some of the widgets from the dashboard home page the at a glance

51
00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:30.570
and some other ones I'm a limiting activity the CEO posts and the quick drafts and the Wordpress news.

52
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:36.650
That is a RSS feed from the Wordpress news repository.

53
00:06:36.850 --> 00:06:43.240
And finally I've added a link to the bottom that says hosting theme and plug in resources page it's

54
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:49.780
Up at the top but I figured I would place a link down there at the bottom that links to the resources

55
00:06:51.970 --> 00:06:59.380
You can see I've used the branding plugin from WPA udev pretty extensively to customize the Wordpress

56
00:07:03.150 --> 00:07:11.380
Let's look at the WPA you dev dashboard plug in and it's settings panel here under the plugins tab.

57
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:20.190
It first shows me which WBM udev plug ins I have installed and I have either an activator or deactivate

58
00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:34.480
bit about the plug in and I can link over to the plug in directions and the description over at WBM

59
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.230
you dev dot org.

60
00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:43.350
Of course you can see right here I'm using the dashboard plugin to manage my updates.

61
00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:50.310
And other information and organization of these plug ins ultimate branding is the one that I just went

62
00:07:51.060 --> 00:07:59.400
I'm using WPA devs backup plug in called snapshot pro and I use that time to set up periodic backups

63
00:07:59.430 --> 00:08:06.750
of all the sites in the student's sandbox as well as are my own sites within that which is the W.P.

64
00:08:06.890 --> 00:08:07.370
of course.

65
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:17.470
And the students of course dot com site I have pop up pro activated for you guys to be able to go ahead

66
00:08:22.450 --> 00:08:28.960
I've introduced the W PMU dev videos earlier in this course and I have that network activated so that

67
00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:44.740
inside of the plugins area on each of the students sites Google Maps.

68
00:08:44.750 --> 00:08:46.280
I just discussed ultimate.

69
00:08:53.990 --> 00:08:59.090
web site and we'll be playing with that in the social networking chapter later in this course.

70
00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:07.130
Membership 2 is a premium plug in for making membership sites and you can see it has a whole lot of

71
00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:15.890
features for making exclusive membership content within your site and protecting that behind a paywall

72
00:09:16.070 --> 00:09:22.170
or an opt in while things like that are going to be playing with that pretty soon in the course I'm

73
00:09:22.290 --> 00:09:29.800
using new blog templates and in the background you don't see availability of this because I'm using

74
00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:36.600
It means that when someone signs up for a new student's sandbox it loads.

75
00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:44.860
Whichever theme I have enabled with the content that's within that example Blug template or new site

76
00:09:44.920 --> 00:09:45.500
template.

77
00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:53.310
So when you first signed up you were able to have the parallax pro site activated within your students

78
00:09:56.300 --> 00:10:04.430
Custom press is an excellent plugin that makes custom taxonomies like categories and like tags you can

79
00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:16.160
That means that if your client or if your site needs some different categories besides just the Blug

80
00:10:24.770 --> 00:10:32.090
and organize their content in terms of another taxonomy like T-shirts or T-shirts sizes something like

81
00:10:32.750 --> 00:10:37.220
It's a very powerful plug in for creating new poster types and taxonomies

82
00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:48.420
pro sites is for multi-site so that you can sell additional access through your multi-site setup.

83
00:10:48.440 --> 00:10:55.070
And I'm not using it within W.P. of course dot com right now but it's possible that I may want to upgrade

84
00:10:55.280 --> 00:11:02.270
some of the student sites with some different you know unpaid areas that are only accessible to certain

85
00:11:04.510 --> 00:11:05.530
When you sign up.

86
00:11:05.570 --> 00:11:13.930
I for a student website I have this MailChimp sync plug in activated so that you get on the news and

87
00:11:13.990 --> 00:11:17.630
updates list so I can email the group whenever I need to.

88
00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:25.950
I'm using the multi-site privacy plug in to make sure that only administrators of their own sites can

89
00:11:27.930 --> 00:11:34.680
Since this is a private student sandbox network I don't want any of the sites to be open to the Internet

90
00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:37.100
and gain extra traffic that we don't need.

91
00:11:38.370 --> 00:11:44.940
Multi-site theme manager is a way to organize the themes inside of your themes page and I may decide

92
00:11:48.610 --> 00:11:51.480
Default theme is currently just in the background.

93
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:56.910
It allows you to select a new default theme for new sites that are created on the network because I'm

94
00:11:56.950 --> 00:12:03.790
using the new blogs templates and I can get more granular control over what new sites look like.

95
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:15.640
Pretty plug ins is a way to organize all the plug ins once we have more and more plug ins that are premium

96
00:12:19.600 --> 00:12:26.060
I'll probably organize them into categories using this great plug in I do allow you to set your own

97
00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:33.080
And this this plugin allows me to do that.

98
00:12:33.090 --> 00:12:39.440
Also this plug in remove email verification allows you to get started right away and get logged right

99
00:12:39.470 --> 00:12:46.100
into your new site as soon as you sign up without having to open an email and verify your account.

100
00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:52.980
This one admin adds another way for me to communicate to the entire network with a block on top of your

101
00:12:54.540 --> 00:13:03.450
If I ever need to and finally sign up code this is how I limit the sign ups to the students inside of

102
00:13:10.590 --> 00:13:12.370
student's sandbox.

103
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:20.130
Below that though the WBM dev dashboard plugin allows me to see available plug ins that I don't have

104
00:13:27.930 --> 00:13:36.800
You can see that there are a ton of premium plug ins that I have available to me with my WPA dev membership

105
00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.160
Well that about does it.

106
00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:51.810
Those are the premium plug ins that I'm using within the WPA udev student's sandbox area and you have

107
00:13:58.370 --> 00:14:03.430
In this video we went over the list of premium plug ins you can use as you build your sites in the student's

108
00:14:09.710 --> 00:14:15.750
the Wordpress multi-site setup that powers the students sandbox itself in the next few chapters.

109
00:14:15.830 --> 00:14:20.690
We get into building some more sites in the student's sandbox creating them using premium themes and
