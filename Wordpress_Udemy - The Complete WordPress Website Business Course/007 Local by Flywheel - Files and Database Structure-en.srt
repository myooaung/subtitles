00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:06,310
In the previous lesson you installed local by flywheel and started your first practice WordPress Web

2
00:00:07,190 --> 00:00:13,580
Now we'll do a little tour of both the Wordpress installation and how local by flywheel sets it up.

3
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,860
and database while using local other local development environments like map for example work in similar

4
00:00:26,990 --> 00:00:32,600
By the end of this video you'll know where to find the files that WordPress uses as well as the database.

5
00:00:32,750 --> 00:00:38,920
Plus you'll start to get more familiar with how WordPress works as a CIMS or a content management system.

6
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,860
Let's go while you have your first website open and running.

7
00:00:44,010 --> 00:00:50,220
Let's take a look at how adding content in the Wordpress dashboard affects what it looks like on the

8
00:00:53,040 --> 00:00:59,190
So with the dashboard open let's just take a look at a few of the different places we have content.

9
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:12,240
And this first post is a default post from WordPress.

10
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:19,750
We look at it it's got a content area and a title and if we go back to the settings in the dashboard

11
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:27,130
I just want to show you under how in settings and reading we have the Web site set so that the home

12
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:37,520
Now if we go back to pages WordPress also comes with a sample page.

13
00:01:37,650 --> 00:01:40,380
And if I click on the title of that page.

14
00:01:41,490 --> 00:01:48,030
They don't have categories and tags associated with them like posts do and they're designed to be more

15
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,470
And so if we wanted the home page of the Web site to display not the latest blog posts but to display

16
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:10,920
One is under settings and reading can see that if I click a static page and then I choose one of my

17
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:20,770
and refresh.

18
00:02:20,880 --> 00:02:22,130
You'll see that as I scroll down.

19
00:02:22,140 --> 00:02:28,890
Now I have the contents of that sample page as the home page instead of the latest blog posts.

20
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,470
in the customize or that's under appearance customize in the Wordpress dashboard.

21
00:02:40,620 --> 00:02:47,100
And if you go there it actually shows you a live representation of what the Web site could look like

22
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,990
as you make changes over here in these items.

23
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,830
So if we look at home page settings that's the same exact information as we have under settings and

24
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,970
reading settings.

25
00:03:05,580 --> 00:03:08,030
Now that's a little bit different isn't it.

26
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:14,810
And if you look this is a different layout than we had on the live site right here.

27
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:21,030
I I've defined the sample page as the home page but over here under the homepage settings in the customize

28
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:34,450
content with static images in the background.

29
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:43,860
Now I'm scrolling down a homepage section and about page and a section of blog posts and you can see

30
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:57,390
Now if I click under home homepage and I click sample page that looks more like the web site looks right

31
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:09,430
Now let's leave it as the customized or as set up and click the publish button.

32
00:04:09,730 --> 00:04:13,920
And now let's go back to the Web site and refresh that page.

33
00:04:13,930 --> 00:04:21,780
You can see that the 20:17 theme allows you to use these homepage sections which have these big wide

34
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:37,260
And this is a way that theme's not just 20:17 but all themes have an opportunity to give you kind of

35
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:47,580
So let's go back into the Wordpress dashboard because I've published under home page settings this static

36
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:57,090
Now if I just click the button on the left and I go under page and all pages you can see that the theme

37
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:05,130
It defines our front page which is the home page is the one called home and that sample content just

38
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:15,510
When we go back to all pages now the blog page doesn't have any content at all.

39
00:05:20,730 --> 00:05:29,670
Ok so here's the you rl or the permalink for that part of the Web site it's the domain name slash blog.

40
00:05:29,730 --> 00:05:35,680
If I right click that and click open in a new tab I could take a look at what that would look like.

41
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:40,150
It has part of the home page image at the top with the site title.

42
00:05:40,170 --> 00:05:41,910
It has some navigation.

43
00:05:45,320 --> 00:05:48,650
Of course we only have one in a list.

44
00:05:51,690 --> 00:05:57,840
Let's go back to the practice site and since we've made that change in the customized You can also see

45
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:03,920
that the theme has given us a sample navigation menu that wasn't there before.

46
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:09,600
One of the great things about this theme is how it sets up the sample content but also how it has this

47
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:18,900
at the bottom of the page.

48
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:25,410
If you click it it rings you up to the next section and then the navigation stack sticks to the top

49
00:06:28,830 --> 00:06:35,160
So no matter where you are on the Web site you can go back and click one of these navigation items.

50
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:43,010
Now I clicked contact and there's some sample page content on a particular page called contact.

51
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:49,950
This gives you a nice starting point so that you can go ahead and start editing those existing pages

52
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:56,520
in the pages section of the Wordpress dashboard and begin getting your theme and the look and feel of

53
00:06:58,410 --> 00:07:04,560
You can stop the video now and start playing with your own site and figuring out how things work including

54
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:09,720
pages post content and the menu items.

55
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:15,600
Now I told you that the menu was already created from the sample content in this theme and if you want

56
00:07:23,790 --> 00:07:24,730
menus.

57
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,200
The top menu is the one that was created for us and you can play with changing that around a little

58
00:07:32,670 --> 00:07:38,760
Come on back here and we'll look at how the local development environment works with wordpress in the

59
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:48,100
Now let's take a look at how the local buy flywheel local development environment uses the Wordpress

60
00:07:48,180 --> 00:07:55,460
files and a mystical database to make WordPress into an effective content management system.

61
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:02,620
First the Wordpress files or the Wordpress core files as they're sometimes referred to.

62
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:10,930
These are the HP files that make up Wordpress and let it work in the browser to connect to the database.

63
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:18,990
So if I go up to my browser I've navigated here to WordPress dot org the Web site for the open source

64
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,090
And you can see that there's a download WordPress button at the top right and if you open that page

65
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:36,030
to download the zip file.

66
00:08:42,510 --> 00:08:48,630
one of the messages we got across the bottom was downloading WordPress flywheel was downloading it from

67
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,550
this very server on our behalf.

68
00:08:51,570 --> 00:09:00,120
It always gets the latest version of Wordpress and we don't have to then download these files because

69
00:09:00,210 --> 00:09:03,590
local by flywheel does that for us.

70
00:09:03,750 --> 00:09:10,170
Now on your own computer if you look at local buy flywheel I remember when we were setting it up we

71
00:09:13,530 --> 00:09:20,550
So right now let's navigate on our computer to where those files are located for our practice site.

72
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:28,740
If you ever was called practice site 1 and now whether you're on Windows or on a Mac it'll be slightly

73
00:09:29,210 --> 00:09:36,370
On a Mac you can use the Finder but in Windows I'll be using the File Explorer whether you're on Windows

74
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:40,270
or a Mac the files are located in a similar location.

75
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:54,550
users and then my own username I go down to a folder called local sites that was created by local by

76
00:10:00,970 --> 00:10:02,920
Here's practice site 1.

77
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:10,150
And then there's a folder called app for application and then the public folder is where the actual

78
00:10:10,280 --> 00:10:13,930
WordPress core files are located.

79
00:10:20,410 --> 00:10:27,930
file structure itself and we're going to be installing WordPress manually at a later time in the course.

80
00:10:28,070 --> 00:10:36,640
And if I go back to the file explorer and look at these this set of 19 or 20 files there's one particular

81
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:47,740
Now from WordPress darg the default comes with a file called W.P. config dash sample.

82
00:10:47,890 --> 00:10:54,520
And if you do install WordPress manually you're you're meant to rename or copy this file and rename

83
00:10:58,030 --> 00:11:05,860
You can see that it's showing in my windows or file explorer that it's a Ph P file and so that file

84
00:11:06,010 --> 00:11:11,020
is already configured to connect to the database in local by flywheel.

85
00:11:16,540 --> 00:11:18,730
But that's where the files are located.

86
00:11:18,910 --> 00:11:25,430
And now let's take a look back into local buy flywheel and look at where the database is located.

87
00:11:27,020 --> 00:11:31,910
Local by flywheel comes with a database utility called admin.

88
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:35,620
And it will install it the first time you click add Mynor.

89
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:46,100
But if you connect the admin or software it opens up a database browser and editor in your browser whether

90
00:11:49,670 --> 00:11:57,680
If you look you can see that it's opened up the database associated with my web site.

91
00:11:57,830 --> 00:12:03,650
And so what I have here are the different tables inside of the database.

92
00:12:07,090 --> 00:12:15,270
Now if I click that table heading and then I go up and I hit the select data button.

93
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:22,640
You can see that there is one user created in wordpress and there's my username name and of course my

94
00:12:31,980 --> 00:12:38,250
And there's one more table that I'd like to show you with some of the data that is in the database in

95
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:48,120
If I select that table and then click select data you can see that there's there's actually quite a

96
00:12:57,000 --> 00:13:05,070
But as you can see it's not stored inside of the actual file structure in wordpress it's stored separately

97
00:13:06,330 --> 00:13:12,780
And that's what makes WordPress a content management system with a database holding all of the content

98
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:24,040
stored as new pages in the files they're stored in the database.

99
00:13:24,090 --> 00:13:30,040
And then WordPress puts it together as a web site directly from the server to the user's browser.

100
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:39,000
And so in options the first two rows are called the site you are l and the home rows and you could see

101
00:13:44,340 --> 00:13:49,970
So that's a small tour of the database and the file structure in wordpress.

102
00:13:50,010 --> 00:13:56,520
Let me show you just one more thing and I'm going to go back to the file explorer in Windows and show

103
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:07,050
This is where you would store any themes that you have installed in wordpress and there's three currently

104
00:14:07,230 --> 00:14:13,080
that come as default themes 2016 2017 and 2015.

105
00:14:13,770 --> 00:14:14,620
I go back.

106
00:14:14,700 --> 00:14:16,900
There's also the plug ins folder.

107
00:14:17,100 --> 00:14:21,790
There's no plug ins installed right now as a default plug in in my installation.

108
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:23,960
And then the uploads folder.

109
00:14:24,030 --> 00:14:32,580
Now I have the year and the month but the only media or images that I have in that uploads folder are

110
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:36,930
have been added by default from the theme itself.

111
00:14:37,080 --> 00:14:41,610
And so I showed you that to show you that inside of the Wordpress file structure.

112
00:14:41,670 --> 00:14:49,410
The only thing that's going to change in this file structure is when you upload themes or plug ins or

113
00:14:49,620 --> 00:14:58,110
media content into the media library and those are in the WP content folder all these other files never

114
00:14:58,170 --> 00:15:06,210
change and shouldn't change in terms of your Wordpress installation We'll get into more detail about

115
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:13,390
Just using the Wordpress dashboard.

116
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:20,490
But for now that gives you an idea of where the files are stored and how you manage the database using

117
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:32,040
In this lesson we took a tour of how WordPress works as a content management system and also how to

118
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:43,890
I'll show you how I would install WordPress manually using local by flywheel.

119
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:44,700
Let's go.
