00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:06.350
In this lesson you'll customize the Wordpress page used as the front page of the brochure site.

2
00:00:06.510 --> 00:00:13.620
You'll also explore the differences between posts and pages in wordpress and add a site logo and icon

3
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:16.760
using the customize or by the end of this video.

4
00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:21.660
You will have already set the brochure site apart and branded it for your client and you'll have an

5
00:00:25.560 --> 00:00:30.220
Plus you'll understand when to use posts and when pages are more appropriate.

6
00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:32.440
Let's get started.

7
00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:40.480
Let's start with editing this front page that we have inside of Word Press called sample page.

8
00:00:40.750 --> 00:00:44.600
For now I think I'd just like to get rid of this title.

9
00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:53.370
Add a nice big image and maybe keep some of this descriptive text in here so I'll go back to that page.

10
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:59.170
Inside the Wordpress dashboard which I have opened here and the first thing I'll do is if you look at

11
00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:06.390
you are l.

12
00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:14.280
That's the permalink here but I'm going to go ahead and just get rid of that page title and click update.

13
00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:24.590
And that once that saves I can go back to my other tab and hit refresh and you'll see that that title

14
00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:30.550
Now I can trim this text a little bit down to what I want.

15
00:01:30.610 --> 00:01:36.310
Let's see I'm just going to select a bunch of this text and hit backspace delete.

16
00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:40.370
Get rid of that and get rid of this text as well.

17
00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:48.890
If I select it you can see that this quotation called blockquote is selected.

18
00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.350
If I get rid of it it's just the regular text but I kind of like that the way that styled as what's

19
00:01:56.990 --> 00:01:59.210
Here is where I'm going to put an image.

20
00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:03.370
Let's just hit update and we'll take a look at that.

21
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:07.170
Once the page refreshes up here we go.

22
00:02:07.210 --> 00:02:15.230
I'll hit refresh great Now if this is a descriptive piece of text about my Web site now I can put a

23
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:22.670
Now I've prepared a huge image for you to use if you like or you can use your own.

24
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.800
It's a seven megabyte image.

25
00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:41.990
And as I introduce to you in chapter one I'd like you to go ahead and open an image editing piece of

26
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.570
Let's say 6500 pixels wide and preferably under 200 kilobytes in size.

27
00:02:56.950 --> 00:03:04.200
So pause the video right now and see how you get the so if you click the image you can click save image

28
00:03:04.230 --> 00:03:07.050
as and then go ahead and save that image.

29
00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:25.170
I've got the image and now I'll open that image in Photoshop and first thing I want to do is click image

30
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:29.400
image size and size that to 6800 pixels wide.

31
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:35.850
There it is at 100 percent so that we can see how large it really is.

32
00:03:39.450 --> 00:03:45.900
Click file save for web and devices and that set on jpeg.

33
00:03:45.970 --> 00:03:49.880
Hi I drag around I can see what it looks like.

34
00:03:52.910 --> 00:03:56.130
Let's see what it looks like with the mediums setting.

35
00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:10.410
It does look just as good on medium and it's only 119 K so I'll hit save and I've got a folder on my

36
00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.410
Call it large image and save

37
00:04:25.230 --> 00:04:25.650
now.

38
00:04:25.670 --> 00:04:34.370
If I go back into WordPress one thing I'll do is just put my cursor there inside of the page where I

39
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:44.760
Open

40
00:04:48.110 --> 00:04:49.590
you can see that's opening.

41
00:04:53.870 --> 00:05:00.440
The full size image is 6300 pixels wide and 123 kilobytes.

42
00:05:00.470 --> 00:05:04.090
I might leave this as a left aligned image.

43
00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:10.310
I don't need to link it to anything and if I look at the sizes these are the sizes I have set in the

44
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:27.500
I can see that since it's left aligned it's placed it inside of the block what line that's right here

45
00:05:27.530 --> 00:05:34.100
if I want to sit that image above that block quote I might change it to no alignment.

46
00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.350
Now it sits above there nicely.

47
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:41.360
Update the page and let's take a look at it on the site.

48
00:05:45.790 --> 00:05:46.210
Nice.

49
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:50.740
Looks great.

50
00:05:52.550 --> 00:05:59.450
Next let's make some edits to the site title and the tag line and add a small logo up here on the left

51
00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:10.440
I go back to my dashboard go ahead and under appearance click customize.

52
00:06:10.500 --> 00:06:18.930
This will open up a live editor will where we'll be able to see the live site here on the right and

53
00:06:18.990 --> 00:06:24.620
a customizing window over here on the left hand side under say identity.

54
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:26.970
You can see that there's a few options here.

55
00:06:27.030 --> 00:06:31.660
The site title which of course is also available under settings general.

56
00:06:31.950 --> 00:06:37.540
But what if I called this fire weed photography.

57
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.110
That's a fire weed plant there.

58
00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:46.050
Potentially this could be a photographer's site

59
00:06:58.300 --> 00:06:58.920
great.

60
00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:03.780
You could see it updating in real time as we update the site title and the tagline here.

61
00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:12.030
Of course we could uncheck the site title and tag line and have that not visible in the case that we

62
00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:24.750
For now let's leave that visible there and we can click save and publish

63
00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:28.470
and there it goes.

64
00:07:29.400 --> 00:07:36.600
So if we look over here at the site on a different tab for fresh air it is fire weed photography up

65
00:07:38.970 --> 00:07:45.540
And then the home link is clickable to that to the home page site title

66
00:07:48.300 --> 00:07:51.030
lets out a logo.

67
00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:59.830
Now it says a suggested image dimensions of 240 by 240 and you might think of going into Photoshop and

68
00:08:00.430 --> 00:08:03.950
or your image editor and preparing an image of that size.

69
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.210
I've already prepared an image that's 240 by 240.

70
00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:13.650
I call it logo image so I'll go ahead and upload that.

71
00:08:19.140 --> 00:08:19.650
to.

72
00:08:19.950 --> 00:08:26.740
To any size I like but I can skip cropping and we'll see what 240 by 240 looks like.

73
00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:28.450
It's nice and square.

74
00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.270
Great.

75
00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:35.240
However you know what I might prefer if it's maybe I don't know about half that size so it doesn't push

76
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:41.410
Well I suppose I wanted to change the logo.

77
00:08:41.510 --> 00:08:46.460
I could actually select that same image and crop it differently.

78
00:08:47.490 --> 00:08:54.200
So I wanted to bring it up like this and then hit Krop image.

79
00:08:54.440 --> 00:08:56.150
I could size it appropriately.

80
00:08:56.680 --> 00:09:06.090
Now I would save and publish and I've got a nice logo that's also clickable to the home page.

81
00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:07.760
Let's add an icon.

82
00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:13.910
Or what we might call a favor on like this w from the wordpress site over here that appears in the browser

83
00:09:14.330 --> 00:09:23.660
using the customize or if you look down here the site icon wants it to be 512 pixels wide and tall a

84
00:09:26.540 --> 00:09:35.360
Well I'll just open up Photoshop maybe do file new years where I am getting into a little bit of graphic

85
00:09:41.800 --> 00:09:46.810
Let's see maybe I'll just choose a background color of a nice dark green

86
00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:57.670
and let's see let's do have a big F for fire weed.

87
00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:04.640
See if I make that let's just make the color of the font nice black

88
00:10:09.030 --> 00:10:15.740
try to find maybe a sort of an elegant capital F

89
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:20.430
You know it's going to show up better.

90
00:10:20.550 --> 00:10:26.180
I think if I make it white instead of black

91
00:10:30.380 --> 00:10:31.490
and here we go

92
00:10:34.820 --> 00:10:35.370
sure

93
00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:44.870
it's going to have to be pretty large to fill it up area.

94
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:50.470
How about even larger than that.

95
00:10:53.240 --> 00:11:01.630
Six hundred point at a little too arch you know that fits nicely for a site icon you've got to keep

96
00:11:07.300 --> 00:11:09.510
on mobile and things like that.

97
00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:10.760
Great.

98
00:11:21.630 --> 00:11:25.360
I'm just going to call this one icon.

99
00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:32.000
Now let's go back to WordPress and I can select the image I'll have to upload it.

100
00:11:45.470 --> 00:11:51.290
Great care it shows with rounded corners and I can save and publish and you can see what it looks like

101
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:58.540
up inside of the site title inside of my tab.

102
00:11:58.550 --> 00:12:02.870
Great nice for fire weed photography.

103
00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:09.200
For the last part of this video let's take a look at the difference between pages and posts in wordpress.

104
00:12:09.650 --> 00:12:15.950
Here in the sidebar by default you'll see that we've got a couple of widgets here on the sidebar one

105
00:12:18.170 --> 00:12:21.360
Let's go ahead and click that hello world.

106
00:12:22.690 --> 00:12:24.800
Let's take a look at this post now.

107
00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:30.570
The header which contains the logo and the site title and the tag line is the same.

108
00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:37.900
But what we have here is a post that contains a few extra things more than what that page contained

109
00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:43.340
that we made as the front page of the Web site it looked virtually the same.

110
00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:49.920
But what we've got is a site title and some content but then to the left side of this theme is an author

111
00:12:50.040 --> 00:12:57.290
name and a Gravatar or an image avatar for the author a date.

112
00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:01.800
And then there's an edit button if you're logged in many pages on your site will give you that edit

113
00:13:07.210 --> 00:13:12.520
But then as you scroll down you can also see that it says one thought on hello world this is a comment.

114
00:13:19.210 --> 00:13:27.120
a reply button and a reply comment field down here in the bottom and the ability to post comments.

115
00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:31.900
These are a few of the differences between pages and posts.

116
00:13:40.150 --> 00:13:47.990
always use the blogging functionality but when you look at posts inside of Wordpress you'll see it we

117
00:13:48.990 --> 00:13:55.600
Hello world post some of the differences we have are the ability to have that day.

118
00:13:55.950 --> 00:13:57.490
And that's called meta data.

119
00:13:57.600 --> 00:14:08.340
Over here on the side or under the header of the post title and then there are post formats that a site's

120
00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:15.110
theme are able to use and define posts in certain different ways.

121
00:14:15.150 --> 00:14:16.350
Also a big difference.

122
00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:20.240
Posts can be categorized and posts can be tagged.

123
00:14:20.610 --> 00:14:28.140
And these are all navigation and find ability conventions so that users can browse different posts and

124
00:14:30.510 --> 00:14:35.990
Otherwise the editing area is virtually the same in a general sense.

125
00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:44.410
Posts are designed to be news or blog areas on a web site somewhere that you post where people can comment

126
00:14:44.750 --> 00:14:50.350
and that you put newer content and ever changing or periodical content on a Web site.

127
00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:57.540
Pages on the other hand are designed to be static and maybe containing some information that doesn't

128
00:15:05.070 --> 00:15:12.000
pages on a Web site like an about page a contact us page and other pages like that and then we might

129
00:15:19.650 --> 00:15:28.270
so that in May 2016 you can see that there was one post the default post posted on this day.

130
00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:32.910
That way users can go through the website and find content they're looking for.

131
00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:39.800
Or look at the blog section of the Web site and see the latest content in this video.

132
00:15:47.900 --> 00:15:57.380
as well as uploaded and configured a logo image edited the site title in the tag line all using the

133
00:15:57.410 --> 00:16:01.920
custom Mizer and the site identity section.

134
00:16:04.550 --> 00:16:13.140
And you learned a little bit about the differences between pages and posts in wordpress in the next

135
00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:26.640
pages that users might like to navigate to like and about page and a contact us page and we'll also
