00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:05.620
In this video you'll be comparing a premium plug in to it's light version.

2
00:00:11.650 --> 00:00:16.630
the premium version inside your students sandbox site and check out the differences.

3
00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.030
this.

4
00:00:23.050 --> 00:00:26.580
It's fine to use the light version if it serves the needs of the project.

5
00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.670
First make sure that your local development environment is open and you're logged into your Wordpress

6
00:00:42.670 --> 00:00:47.640
light plug in should be one of the first that comes up and go ahead and click Install now.

7
00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:55.080
Once you've activated the plug in you can see that it gives you a control menu down here and if you

8
00:00:55.410 --> 00:01:02.010
roll over and click soliloquy it will bring you to your soliloquy sliders page one of the ways that

9
00:01:09.690 --> 00:01:15.960
for photographers and those that want to display groups of images and sliders in different places on

10
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:31.350
short codes to insert them anywhere you want into posts into pages into the sidebar widgets of your

11
00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:40.780
You'll get a feel for what I mean as we play with the plug in here in our local environment.

12
00:01:42.130 --> 00:01:49.870
Click Add new at the top or down under the menu where it says add new under soliloquy and we'll create

13
00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:55.470
a slider by titling it slider one or anything you like.

14
00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.850
And let's just publish that slider for now to save it.

15
00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:05.570
Great It shows you where you can get the codes to place the slider in different places on your website

16
00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:08.600
by opening this overlay dialog here.

17
00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:16.270
And one of the things you'll notice right away is that the soliloquy pro version lets you access the

18
00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:29.290
our media library into the slider's and save them and associate them with different sliders in the light

19
00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:44.690
So how can we easily get the images that we need on our computer to upload right here.

20
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:56.770
They're not at an external server that we would need to FCP over to to download the images.

21
00:02:56.780 --> 00:03:04.760
So if I just go select images I can go directly into where I have Seacole and under map as you'll be

22
00:03:13.850 --> 00:03:20.050
Ah I see they're divided into folders by the year.

23
00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:20.840
There we go.

24
00:03:28.340 --> 00:03:30.000
Let's see what I have here.

25
00:03:30.050 --> 00:03:37.990
I might go and look and see which of these images is the right size 12 80 by 960.

26
00:03:38.010 --> 00:03:40.190
That final one looks like the large one.

27
00:03:45.070 --> 00:03:47.220
These have the sizes on them here.

28
00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:50.610
The biggest one is the 600.

29
00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.970
So it's looks like it's the last image in each of the lists.

30
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:59.900
Control and select these two first and had open.

31
00:04:00.060 --> 00:04:08.080
OK so I found those two images and now hit select Let's go and do a few more maybe I'll make six images.

32
00:04:08.770 --> 00:04:19.480
For this slider 0 in 2011 0 7 there were some more yes I recognize these images OK now that I have all

33
00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:32.440
can look at the configuration if we just look at the default configuration.

34
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:42.680
I'm just going to leave all the settings as they are grab from this overlay.

35
00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:52.590
One of the short codes I'm hearing Control-C to copy it and then I'm going to go into pages all pages

36
00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:58.990
and I want both of these open in my browser so I'm going to open the pages tab inside the dashboard

37
00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:09.550
in another tab and open the portfolio page and I'll put my slider there below the portfolio that we

38
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:17.800
So if I just put my cursor there and it enter I'll just head it put a heading

39
00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:22.070
of the name of the slider.

40
00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:30.390
I'll take control V and copy that slider code and hit update.

41
00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:34.880
And let's open that portfolio page and see what it looks like.

42
00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:51.340
There it is looks like I've got navigation below it begins to play and I can also use.

43
00:05:51.460 --> 00:05:59.080
Now you can see that the size of this is as we had seen in the configuration area.

44
00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:06.810
And if you notice the slider dimensions 960 by 300 and that's designed for say a page header or something

45
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:15.820
You can click through to any of the dots.

46
00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:19.560
The images are cropped instead of stretched or shrunken.

47
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.920
So that's good it keeps the proportions the same.

48
00:06:22.900 --> 00:06:24.720
And that is a nice looking slider.

49
00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:33.040
Let's fix it to fit it on this page so if we wanted to have a slider of our correctly proportioned or

50
00:06:40.810 --> 00:06:41.820
like this.

51
00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:45.410
Let's see we have to make this a little bit wider.

52
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:48.440
And I would make them taller as well.

53
00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:56.470
Now I kind of find out the width of my column here as I got it set to full screen instead of having

54
00:06:57.610 --> 00:06:59.920
That's how what I want the slider to be.

55
00:07:08.660 --> 00:07:09.720
that area.

56
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:17.650
It's a paragraph type format and 10 68 by 144 is that.

57
00:07:22.500 --> 00:07:30.450
I can put 10 68 pixels inside of the width but what should I have as the height if I want to find out

58
00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:44.420
Photoshop and open an image and do a little resizing.

59
00:07:44.460 --> 00:07:49.000
So it's the inside of my computer.

60
00:07:49.960 --> 00:07:58.940
In the map folder in Seacole and HD docs live site W.P. content uploads.

61
00:07:58.990 --> 00:08:00.090
Here we go.

62
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.170
Now if I find this large one.

63
00:08:03.190 --> 00:08:12.540
Let's go ahead and open it in Photoshop and what I'll do is change it to ten sixty eight pixels wide

64
00:08:12.840 --> 00:08:19.580
and then look at the height and this will work best if all of the photos are the same proportions.

65
00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:29.440
But even if they're not you don't make the slider a consistent width and height.

66
00:08:29.560 --> 00:08:39.340
So if I make it 10 68 and the height is 8 0 1 so 8 800 is probably a good height to keep this in its

67
00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:50.540
So I'll go back to the silly little soliloquy slider configuration screen and choose 800 and I'll go

68
00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:05.830
There you go that's the right width and it looks like I have the full height you can make it whatever

69
00:09:14.410 --> 00:09:14.740
it.

70
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:25.720
A couple of more of the features I can see here in the soliloquy light of plug in is under the images

71
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:33.010
tab if you click the edit or this eye button under any of the images you can change the title the alt

72
00:09:33.070 --> 00:09:33.810
text.

73
00:09:33.940 --> 00:09:40.420
And this is an interesting thing to work with with an image slider especially if you use it for advertising

74
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:52.150
You can make a link happen for each of the slaughter images that links to a specific place that you

75
00:09:52.510 --> 00:09:54.710
You can even have it open in a new tab.

76
00:09:54.850 --> 00:10:03.130
And it's there's also an image caption area that you can do for each of your images in the slider.

77
00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:18.550
the image slider the image slider starts out with an automatic slideshow happening.

78
00:10:18.850 --> 00:10:25.630
Now the images wait a certain amount of time and they fade into the next image and we can control the

79
00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.700
speed are all possible to set.

80
00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:40.500
But we can't turn off that automatic slide show from working.

81
00:10:40.690 --> 00:10:43.620
Some of these features we'll see in the Pro version.

82
00:10:44.550 --> 00:10:51.590
Now let's move over to your student sandbox at whatever your user name is Dot W.P. of course dot com.

83
00:10:51.600 --> 00:10:59.700
You can go to students W.P. of course dotcom and then log in with your username and if you open up your

84
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:08.940
Let's open up plug ins and let's just look at the list of plug ins to start with.

85
00:11:09.050 --> 00:11:16.160
You may have noticed in this list as you get down to the S's the soliloquy is already active and that's

86
00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:26.150
But then there are these additional soliloquy add ons that come with the premium version where you can

87
00:11:29.780 --> 00:11:36.890
There's some other scheduling there's different themes there so newcomers add on if you're doing e-commerce

88
00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:45.500
There's Instagram you can pull images from an external service like Instagram or Pinterest and that

89
00:11:46.370 --> 00:11:52.100
So there's a lot of different add ons that you can add to soliloquy if we just look in the soliloquy

90
00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:02.670
That is my developer license key so don't erase that you won't be able to get it back.

91
00:12:02.890 --> 00:12:09.480
Then if we click add ons and click refresh add ons you'll see that all of these are present within the

92
00:12:12.690 --> 00:12:21.420
So with any of these premium add ons you can actually add these as one offs instead of adding every

93
00:12:27.810 --> 00:12:32.280
Let's start by creating a soliloquy slider of our own.

94
00:12:38.030 --> 00:12:42.340
And this is slightly familiar.

95
00:12:42.440 --> 00:12:49.760
I'll call this one slider one and you can see that you can either select files from your computer just

96
00:12:56.300 --> 00:13:02.900
the media library load more images from the library.

97
00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.940
Of course I only have these three images within the media library here at my students Sandbach site.

98
00:13:08.070 --> 00:13:14.490
But if I click this one and that one and I can just click insert slides into the slider and there they

99
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:20.490
You can see this looks fairly familiar.

100
00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:23.990
There's a few more slighter transition options.

101
00:13:24.060 --> 00:13:30.900
There's a few other options here and these checkboxes are all not present in the light version.

102
00:13:37.470 --> 00:13:44.040
interesting if your mouse is hovered over the slide and you want to look at it it'll pause the slide.

103
00:13:44.070 --> 00:13:49.830
I'm not starting the slide show automatically so I don't need that one but there's a lot more options

104
00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:57.850
inside of this premium version of soliloquy rather than just the other light version.

105
00:13:59.450 --> 00:14:02.500
So I'll just hit publish to start with.

106
00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.430
And let's look at what that default soliloquy slider looks like.

107
00:14:07.510 --> 00:14:16.550
I'll just hit control-C to copy the short code and then I'm going to create a new page inside of my

108
00:14:19.370 --> 00:14:24.870
I'll just call it slider and I'll paste that code directly in there and hit publish.

109
00:14:27.950 --> 00:14:30.210
And let's see what that looks like.

110
00:14:30.230 --> 00:14:38.060
I can just click the permalink right here and I'll clip right click and open it in a new tab and there

111
00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.530
here.

112
00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:58.180
I want to take a look at my open web developer inspector again let's see what I have here.

113
00:14:58.230 --> 00:15:09.930
This is only 740 pixels wide 740 is the width of the parallax Parow main column and so that shows that

114
00:15:10.710 --> 00:15:19.550
this slider is mobile responsive if you drag your your window to the left you'll see that it conforms

115
00:15:27.490 --> 00:15:34.060
of the differences between the light plug in and the pro or commercial premium version if I go back

116
00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.930
or go into the slider one and under config.

117
00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:57.170
I'm going to leave that fact I'm going to go to the same proportions as I had before.

118
00:16:00.510 --> 00:16:09.240
And update that slider now to make my image taller but most likely if I refresh the page right now it'll

119
00:16:09.250 --> 00:16:17.920
stay constrained within the 7 140 pixel wide column and sliders will always do that so that they don't

120
00:16:18.250 --> 00:16:25.660
go over sidebar content or make the theme look bad by overlapping some other content that might be on

121
00:16:27.400 --> 00:16:30.040
But let's add one of the add ons.

122
00:16:42.420 --> 00:16:43.850
is activated now.

123
00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:55.940
And so if I go to my soliloquy slider list again and hit slider one I can go to the carousel tab which

124
00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:05.910
So on slider one just this one slider I can enable the carousel add on if I want to.

125
00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:09.650
And let's see the slide with the slide height

126
00:17:13.710 --> 00:17:16.630
so Max with let's take a look.

127
00:17:16.700 --> 00:17:22.770
Ten sixty eight point eight hundred and update and let's just see what that looks like.

128
00:17:26.050 --> 00:17:31.120
I'll go over to the page and refresh the page.

129
00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:35.570
Now that is a carousel that is doing the same proportions.

130
00:17:35.580 --> 00:17:44.560
But now if I had a long list of items they could be within that carousel inside of the page OK.

131
00:17:44.570 --> 00:17:47.000
But how about one more option.

132
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:52.120
Actually I didn't save that but that's OK.

133
00:17:52.160 --> 00:17:57.600
Let's go back into the add ons and let's look at the light box add on.

134
00:17:57.620 --> 00:18:05.900
So I've activated light box and I'll go back to the soliloquy page and choose my slider one.

135
00:18:06.140 --> 00:18:12.770
If I go back to carrousel and disable it and go over to light box and enable the light box slider let's

136
00:18:21.530 --> 00:18:24.340
Now let's take a look at how that has configured itself.

137
00:18:27.890 --> 00:18:35.770
Right now that's the normal slider like we've had without the light box but if I click the photo it

138
00:18:35.830 --> 00:18:43.700
opens some thumbnails at the bottom and a light box display right out of that slider.

139
00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:50.660
That's a good way to make a small thumbnail slider to be clickable and open up larger versions of the

140
00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:59.800
In this video you explored both the light version and the premium version of a plug in the soliloquy

141
00:19:04.270 --> 00:19:08.650
The premium version might be the answer for our client sites specific needs.

142
00:19:08.890 --> 00:19:14.230
However because the premium version exists the light version gets the benefit of updates and developer

143
00:19:17.920 --> 00:19:22.350
In the next video will tour the premium plug ins inside your students sandbox.

144
00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.350
We'll be using them throughout the rest of the course as we build more Web site projects in the sandbox.
