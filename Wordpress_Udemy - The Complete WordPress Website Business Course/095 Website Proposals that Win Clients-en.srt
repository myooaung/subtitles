00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,000
In this chapter we'll wrap up the course with lessons on client proposals and Web site care plans and

2
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:16,860
We'll go into some detail about how to describe the value you bring to a project and how to write proposals

3
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:22,850
money.

4
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:28,560
Knowing the value you bring to their businesses plus you'll have a framework for easily reading proposals

5
00:00:30,860 --> 00:00:32,260
So how do you get clients.

6
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:39,230
And once you find some how do you give them proposals that have tons of value and make them want to

7
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:42,170
You're agreed on price.

8
00:00:42,290 --> 00:00:46,550
Well in the students dot W.P. of course dot com Web site.

9
00:00:52,670 --> 00:00:56,100
down a little bit lower under graphics and miscellaneous.

10
00:01:01,550 --> 00:01:07,640
Now if you click the up work link this is where I started in my web design business.

11
00:01:14,930 --> 00:01:24,790
with people that need work 100 percent of the work I do nowadays comes from referrals from other clients

12
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,690
and friends and people that know that I make Web sites and get me in touch with people that have a need.

13
00:01:30,940 --> 00:01:36,880
But when I was first starting out I used Elance dot com which is now up work to sign up and become a

14
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:45,010
You can see that up here.

15
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,760
But as a freelancer yourself you can find jobs.

16
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:55,690
Browse them and then bid on them for free.

17
00:02:03,760 --> 00:02:05,230
developers.

18
00:02:11,650 --> 00:02:17,860
it's really easy to get your first few jobs and browse the jobs and only select ones that you know you

19
00:02:22,490 --> 00:02:29,900
Now I've logged into my account at work and if I click view my profile you can see that I've got job

20
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:44,930
that I've earned as well as some reviews that people have given me about my work that I've done on their

21
00:02:48,650 --> 00:02:55,970
You can see I started you know back in 2009 all the way up through 2012 but I haven't done much work

22
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:13,170
Before we leave up work for this lesson I'll show you under Jobs if I just look for the word WordPress.

23
00:03:13,300 --> 00:03:17,070
You can see that there's going to be thousands of jobs available.

24
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,070
Eleven thousand six hundred ninety four jobs found that have the word WordPress in it.

25
00:03:22,210 --> 00:03:28,420
Now I can browse these and I can narrow my search and filter it over here and I can look at what people

26
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:38,920
need and it's free to bid on these jobs and you can win work gain experience make money and start out

27
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:52,130
W.P. of course dot.com resources page is called W.P. elevation.

28
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:59,790
If you click that link I have it open already here their home page is W.P. elevation and this is created

29
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:08,090
Along with this person Christina Romero and is really the world's largest business community for Wordpress

30
00:04:08,100 --> 00:04:15,030
consultants WordPress developers WordPress implementor's anyone that works with wordpress in a business

31
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:26,610
They also have a paid membership that is very worth joining where they have a Facebook community a very

32
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:36,490
And if you scroll down a little bit on the WP elevation website you can read about what its all about.

33
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:42,020
But even right here these blog posts are very very valuable.

34
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:48,360
I'm going to direct you to click more articles and open a little bit lower down and this article the

35
00:04:52,470 --> 00:04:59,040
Now I don't usually do this within the course but I'm going to have you read a very long blog post which

36
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:11,570
this mini course of a blog post.

37
00:05:11,610 --> 00:05:20,010
They allow you to download some PTF guides and worksheets and they can really train you to win clients

38
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:22,050
at higher prices.

39
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,690
I've been able to charge higher prices because of it.

40
00:05:35,190 --> 00:05:43,170
Now in this post Troy talks about winning clients by giving them the best proposal possible.

41
00:05:49,320 --> 00:05:52,680
instead of the features in this e-commerce example.

42
00:05:52,740 --> 00:05:58,830
You know we're going to have integrated marketing with an email list et cetera but that doesn't really

43
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:10,320
We'll have a streamlined checkout using a certain plug in and an e-commerce system of course that you've

44
00:06:13,980 --> 00:06:20,760
The benefit to that is faster sales lower cart abandonment rate and other benefits that having an excellent

45
00:06:20,790 --> 00:06:26,040
e-commerce system give you sales and promo capability is another feature.

46
00:06:31,260 --> 00:06:33,490
and sales for the client.

47
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:40,080
So the whole idea is that in your proposal you address the potential clients business and there are

48
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,460
So after you've read this whole blog post you know you're going to get a lot of value out of just doing

But if you join with your name and your e-mail and join the waiting list you'll be able to participate

52
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:16,270
in a prerecorded webinar and get a whole lot of benefits even without joining the paid membership for

53
00:07:18,650 --> 00:07:26,840
By just participating in the pre-launch videos and other releases that Troy Dean and his partner Christina

54
00:07:27,020 --> 00:07:34,160
put out when they're gearing up to start the W.P. elevation and Rollman process I've been able to create

55
00:07:34,520 --> 00:07:43,190
and win clients with a proposal that looks like this is an actual proposal that landed me a job worth

56
00:07:53,750 --> 00:08:01,220
website proposal blueprint in the form of a word document that you can take and customize for yourself

57
00:08:01,580 --> 00:08:05,670
and use to win clients over here.

58
00:08:05,660 --> 00:08:07,890
I've got a copy of his proposal.

59
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:14,680
Example This comes directly from W.P. elevation and Troy Dean and it's just a sample proposal.

60
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:20,490
You can see how much it looks like the one that I used to win that large client for myself.

61
00:08:20,640 --> 00:08:28,590
And you can feel free to edit this your own purposes and use it to win clients.

62
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:31,050
Let's go through what this proposal entails.

63
00:08:31,220 --> 00:08:37,060
You can even take this information and simply use it to put together a proposal of your own.

64
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:43,610
It starts out with a snapshot and after interviewing the client you can see that you can write something

65
00:08:49,940 --> 00:08:55,990
you can get a little bit more specific here and then as you go down they've got a target audience.

66
00:08:56,180 --> 00:09:02,450
And by again interviewing the client looking at what their business is you can identify what their target

67
00:09:05,390 --> 00:09:11,660
Once you define that you can state a solution that you'll be providing them with a few paragraphs and

68
00:09:20,210 --> 00:09:25,790
There's further considerations that you can model and then a project timeline where you have a period

69
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:39,200
Troy talks about using the word investment instead of cost or something else because really they're

70
00:09:42,440 --> 00:09:50,930
And then some by having a profitable Web site there's also extra options that you can add.

71
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,070
This here is a $10000 proposal.

72
00:09:54,300 --> 00:10:02,160
And Troy advertises that he gives you this $10000 proposal template that you can use to create your

73
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:09,490
And then he's got this really informative and valuable frequently asked questions section.

74
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:16,740
People really don't know or care what Wordpress is necessarily or information architecture an interactive

75
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,200
prototype but you can define why we use Wordpress.

76
00:10:21,240 --> 00:10:27,600
Something about hosting and also about after the Web site is launched you can talk about your Web site

77
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:36,300
these in the next video in this course.

78
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:45,250
Well that's a summary of this project winning proposal and hopefully you'll get in there and take a

79
00:10:51,380 --> 00:10:56,900
Lastly of course you'll want to have a section of your own web site that tells about your website design

80
00:11:02,900 --> 00:11:08,600
If you're just starting out you won't have these yet but you can talk about Wordpress and how ubiquitous

81
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:10,640
it is throughout the whole Internet.

82
00:11:10,820 --> 00:11:17,200
And as you start making web sites you can put links to your own designs straight on your Web site here.

83
00:11:17,240 --> 00:11:22,790
I encourage people to contact me through my contact form here on the Web site and because I'm usually

84
00:11:29,240 --> 00:11:31,540
page or the contact form all that much.

85
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:38,930
I generally make emails or phone contacts directly to the potential clients in this video.

86
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,760
You learned how I started out using a freelancer's online Web site to find new jobs and build my experience

87
00:11:44,790 --> 00:11:48,050
and ability by building on small jobs to start with.

88
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,240
Now I get almost all of my work through referrals.

89
00:11:51,420 --> 00:11:57,300
If you haven't yet go back and read the informative blog post by Troy dean of W.P. elevation and join

90
00:11:59,070 --> 00:12:02,450
There's a lot of valuable information there in the next lesson.

91
00:12:02,490 --> 00:12:07,620
We'll move on to ongoing revenue through web site care and maintenance plans and how to present them
