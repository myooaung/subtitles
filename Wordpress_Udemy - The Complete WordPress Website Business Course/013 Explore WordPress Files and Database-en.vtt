00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:04.710
Now that you have a local WordPress installation let's mess with it.

2
00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:09.220
We'll check out the file structure play with how WordPress connects to the database by changing the

3
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.800
RL breaking Web site and then fixing it again by editing the database tables.

4
00:00:20.140 --> 00:00:22.930
something that's not possible through WordPress itself.

5
00:00:23.230 --> 00:00:28.840
In this video you'll learn several skills that can help you save a hacked or broken web site and learn

6
00:00:31.900 --> 00:00:33.570
Sweet.

7
00:00:33.730 --> 00:00:40.180
Make sure you have map open and the servers are running before you can navigate to your local development

8
00:00:46.810 --> 00:00:54.070
the users area at a dot site Ground dot com and click the log in button and go ahead and log in with

9
00:00:56.110 --> 00:01:03.420
Once you're there in the user area you can go down to the right hand side and click go to admin panel.

10
00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:10.540
Usually right click and open a new tab so that I can maintain the site Ground user account area in a

11
00:01:12.100 --> 00:01:18.850
When you go to that new tab by using that go to admin panel button skycraft will log you into your Wordpress

12
00:01:21.190 --> 00:01:29.500
Alternatively as you know you can navigate opening a new tab to the U r l of your site ground site and

13
00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:40.150
and you'll be right there.

14
00:01:40.210 --> 00:01:46.960
Of course if you do that first before logging in using the site Ground dashboard you'll get this log

15
00:01:54.390 --> 00:02:01.470
Outside of the provided students sandbox you can either use your site Ground live site or your local

16
00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.120
Using map whichever you prefer.

17
00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:12.420
Go ahead and log in and let's explore where themes and plug ins are located.

18
00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:20.990
Appearance themes is where we see the default theme 2016 active and a couple of other themes that come

19
00:02:21.110 --> 00:02:30.230
with Wordpress and then if you click plugins installed plug ins you'll see that they're located in a

20
00:02:37.130 --> 00:02:46.160
Let's play with Hello Dolly activate that plug in an original plug in by founder of Wordpress Matt Mullen

21
00:02:54.350 --> 00:03:01.610
We look at the file structure under map H.T. docs WP of course one where the plug ins and the themes

22
00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:09.720
Now it's important to know that you don't want to change any files under W.P. dash admin though the

23
00:03:09.830 --> 00:03:15.520
dash includes or any of the files in the core structure besides the config file.

24
00:03:16.100 --> 00:03:22.240
But the WP Dasch content file is where all your content including uploads.

25
00:03:22.610 --> 00:03:28.820
Once you upload a file to the media library it'll create an uploads folder here and the plug ins and

26
00:03:33.170 --> 00:03:38.390
And if you're using your site Ground live environment you can go back into the site Ground user area

27
00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:45.380
and click go to see panel the control panel will give you access to that file manager that we used in

28
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:53.870
So inside the see panel go down a little bit further to where I can see files and click file manager

29
00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:02.230
under W.P. content you can see that I have plug ins and themes and this time I have upgrade and uploads

30
00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:03.080
as well.

31
00:04:03.190 --> 00:04:09.460
Upgrade is created automatically by WordPress for updates of the software and uploads is created for

32
00:04:10.940 --> 00:04:15.790
But under plug ins there is my list of installed plugins.

33
00:04:15.820 --> 00:04:20.860
Now if you end up with a plug in conflict where you have an active plug in or you activate one that

34
00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:29.320
An easy way to go in and rectify that situation is to go in via FCP.

35
00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:36.400
If you're on a live web server or here using Windows Explorer you can go in and see which plugins are

36
00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:42.890
Here this one instead of being in a folder being a very simple plug in is just a single file.

37
00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:51.340
If you go in and just rename a plugin file I'll just put Dasch rename after it.

38
00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:04.440
I've have activated and it says the plug in Hello duppy HP has been deactivated.

39
00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:06.230
The plugin file does not exist.

40
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.970
the plug in and then that can bring your website either back live or eliminate the plug in conflict.

41
00:05:20.050 --> 00:05:22.080
If you are having one.

42
00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:29.670
So now if I go back and into Windows Explorer I just go back and rename that plug in back to what it

43
00:05:32.790 --> 00:05:37.820
This is one way to troubleshoot conflicts with your web site as you're building it.

44
00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:45.540
You can see it if I refresh the page here in the Wordpress dashboard that plug in is now D activated

45
00:05:46.530 --> 00:05:50.970
and this is a good way to make your web site and your dashboard back active again.

46
00:06:00.950 --> 00:06:05.980
settings here we could see that one of the first couple of things we have is the title and the tag line

47
00:06:06.290 --> 00:06:13.790
but the word address on the site address are the third the fourth fields in the general settings panel

48
00:06:14.120 --> 00:06:17.410
and you could see that the URLs are the same.

49
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:24.700
But let's explore where these your L's are located within the database and find out how to change those

50
00:06:24.820 --> 00:06:26.830
and why we would in the first place.

51
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:35.350
So if you navigate to the map start page again you can right click and open the PMI admin panel in a

52
00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:42.360
new tab which I've already done up here and here we are in the database and I can click the WP.

53
00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:49.930
WordPress.

54
00:06:50.230 --> 00:06:56.620
And if you are using the same ground live site you can go down to the database sections in the see panel

55
00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:58.360
and open Ph.

56
00:06:58.390 --> 00:06:59.440
My admin.

57
00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:06.250
It's the same exact utility that map uses and databases on the live site are located right here.

58
00:07:13.810 --> 00:07:15.460
options.

59
00:07:22.670 --> 00:07:28.720
and the first two are the site you are and the home.

60
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:39.500
Over here you can double click right here and change that to what you want.

61
00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:56.580
change the row inside of the table.

62
00:07:57.820 --> 00:07:58.240
In

63
00:08:01.260 --> 00:08:06.420
the database.

64
00:08:08.010 --> 00:08:17.560
Now if I change those two I can go back and if I just refresh the dashboard here you can see that the

65
00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:27.760
Now of course I cannot access my website dashboard or the website itself through this domain name.

66
00:08:27.910 --> 00:08:35.050
Of course one dot com unless I own that domain name and I have the domain pointed to the server using

67
00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:46.090
This is something you might run across as you migrate sites from either a staging environment into the

68
00:08:53.080 --> 00:08:59.430
building in one place under a testing you are all over to another live.

69
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:01.290
You are all on the server.

70
00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.030
As well as if you're building a site and testing your L and then you point the domain finally to the

71
00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:16.530
building the web site.

72
00:09:16.550 --> 00:09:22.730
Now if you can't navigate to the Web site or the dashboard because the DNS settings are already pointed

73
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:34.290
What happens if I try to go to localhost where I know the site is located local or slashed of.

74
00:09:34.310 --> 00:09:39.450
Of course one slash W.P. the admin.

75
00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:46.310
If I navigate there there's a problem loading the page server's not found because it wants to redirect

76
00:09:46.640 --> 00:09:50.730
to wherever the database tells it to redirect so.

77
00:09:50.740 --> 00:09:55.880
On the server or in your home development environment your local development environment you can navigate

78
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.320
so that I can actually continue building the site.

79
00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:13.060
If you remember that would be local host slash W.P. of course one

80
00:10:17.170 --> 00:10:20.320
and then I'll do the same thing with the home Yoro

81
00:10:28.950 --> 00:10:39.710
and now I can be sure that if I want to go to local host there would be that of course one my web web

82
00:10:39.730 --> 00:10:41.260
site should be back working again.

83
00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.620
Yes here it is.

84
00:10:42.750 --> 00:10:55.140
And I'm still love them so I can actually go to the dashboard and continue working on the site.

85
00:10:55.230 --> 00:10:56.800
So give that a try yourself.

86
00:10:56.970 --> 00:11:04.590
Break the website and then fix it again by editing the site you are l and the home your URL in the database

87
00:11:07.980 --> 00:11:08.410
OK.

88
00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:26.280
Now let's take a look at some more of the file structure under themes and I'm going to navigate to the

89
00:11:34.470 --> 00:11:38.870
Let's go ahead and just verify that here it is.

90
00:11:47.250 --> 00:11:56.010
And one of the main files that performs lay out functions and defines how the content is displayed in

91
00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:08.850
Sometimes this will be a file that you might make changes on to customize a web site but there's a best

92
00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:23.160
Let's take a look inside WordPress by default the Wordpress dashboard comes with under the appearance

93
00:12:26.540 --> 00:12:32.270
This is a place where you can successfully edit things like the style sheet but let's take a look over

94
00:12:34.490 --> 00:12:39.850
Here is the function Scott ph P file.

95
00:12:39.890 --> 00:12:48.410
Now we'll discuss creating child themes to successfully and properly edit the functions stop DHP file

96
00:12:49.530 --> 00:12:54.810
without breaking the theme or even changing the parent theme at all.

97
00:12:55.200 --> 00:13:03.560
But for now if we look at the function stoppie HP file it's got some ph p code in here that usually

98
00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:13.720
has depending on the theme that you have open.

99
00:13:13.730 --> 00:13:20.690
But what if we come down here to the very bottom of the theme and what if I go over here and by accident

100
00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:25.050
I get rid of a semi-colon and then I update that file.

101
00:13:27.270 --> 00:13:29.760
Now here we go I have a white screen.

102
00:13:38.490 --> 00:13:38.910
screen.

103
00:13:40.890 --> 00:13:43.500
I wonder if my live Web site lets refresh the Web site.

104
00:13:44.980 --> 00:13:46.000
Oh boy.

105
00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.460
I just broke my website completely.

106
00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:55.510
The live site if I was working on it is now producing a white screen for visitors and I can't even get

107
00:14:03.010 --> 00:14:10.060
Well similar to renaming a plug in you can edit that functions that file outside of the Wordpress dashboard

108
00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:12.640
and you can fix what you just broke.

109
00:14:14.830 --> 00:14:17.570
So let's go back into the file structure.

110
00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:20.450
I'll do this with Windows Explorer on my local machine.

111
00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:27.570
But in a live site I could go in via P via FCP and I could look for the files I need to edit.

112
00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:37.480
So under H.T. docs Here's my EPD of course one site under W.P. content theme's 2016.

113
00:14:37.780 --> 00:14:41.940
Here's the function Zappy H-P file that I just edited in the Wordpress dashboard.

114
00:14:42.100 --> 00:14:46.740
If I right click that I'll open it in my text editor Adam my code editor

115
00:14:50.010 --> 00:14:55.640
and as that's opening up here it is the file I was just looking at inside of WordPress.

116
00:14:55.740 --> 00:15:00.620
I can now access via FCP or using Windows Explorer.

117
00:15:00.690 --> 00:15:05.700
If I go to the bottom I can see my missing semi-colon.

118
00:15:05.790 --> 00:15:12.150
Now if I was adding some code maybe copying and pasting some code into my functions that BHP file to

119
00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:25.850
and get back to where I was or hopefully I'd had made a backup of a working function stop the HP file

120
00:15:33.260 --> 00:15:42.520
in control as to save the file and since that's just located here on my local machine I don't have to

121
00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:45.190
It's already here.

122
00:15:50.890 --> 00:15:52.070
Cross your fingers.

123
00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:53.830
Ah.

124
00:15:54.140 --> 00:15:55.710
I'm back in OK.

125
00:15:55.910 --> 00:15:57.880
I say is back working again.

126
00:15:57.890 --> 00:16:00.760
If I refresh the actual site.

127
00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:02.350
Great.

128
00:16:02.420 --> 00:16:04.410
Take a deep breath.

129
00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:06.880
I've just fixed the site.

130
00:16:06.950 --> 00:16:12.020
So go ahead and break your own site open the functions that the HP file.

131
00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:21.030
Remove a semi-colon and then save that update the file and then go ahead and go in via Windows Explorer.

132
00:16:21.070 --> 00:16:30.310
Open the functions that THP file in your code editor replace what you changed and then go back into

133
00:16:33.820 --> 00:16:34.490
Nice job.

134
00:16:35.960 --> 00:16:36.950
One more thing.

135
00:16:37.190 --> 00:16:39.990
Let's go ahead and look at user accounts.

136
00:16:41.090 --> 00:16:47.720
You should probably be the only user within your account in wordpress and you can see your Wordpress

137
00:16:47.750 --> 00:16:48.620
email there.

138
00:16:48.770 --> 00:16:50.750
Your role as administrator.

139
00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:58.650
name.

140
00:16:58.820 --> 00:17:05.420
Maybe my site was getting recognized and trying to get hacked and they've recognized my username and

141
00:17:07.730 --> 00:17:13.850
Perhaps you're editing someone else's WordPress installation that's older and is using the traditional

142
00:17:14.090 --> 00:17:21.290
admin as a user name which is best practice not to use because it's too recognizable for hackers.

143
00:17:26.450 --> 00:17:32.330
Well let's go ahead and change the user name using the database so navigate back to the database or

144
00:17:32.510 --> 00:17:34.530
go back there if you already have it open.

145
00:17:34.550 --> 00:17:37.210
Let's look at our WordPress tables again.

146
00:17:38.270 --> 00:17:48.760
And let's see under W.P. users I can see that there's a user here user log in is where the user name

147
00:17:48.790 --> 00:17:50.480
is located.

148
00:17:50.500 --> 00:17:58.860
Now if I just double click that row I could change that to a different username.

149
00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:03.010
What if I just add my middle initial and hit enter.

150
00:18:03.770 --> 00:18:04.170
Great.

151
00:18:09.170 --> 00:18:11.970
Oh it's logged me out because there is no more.

152
00:18:18.810 --> 00:18:20.760
So I wonder if I can log in.

153
00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:22.030
Whoops.

154
00:18:23.310 --> 00:18:33.890
Using the same username and password except I've added an s my middle initial Great let's look at my

155
00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:42.380
So if you need to change the user name from admin to something different or do that you don't have to

156
00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:53.010
You can go into the database and edit that username in this lesson.

157
00:18:58.230 --> 00:19:02.300
The database and the themes functions dopy H-P file.

158
00:19:02.550 --> 00:19:09.960
First you edited a plugins name to deactivate it in case of a plug in conflict breaking the Web site.
