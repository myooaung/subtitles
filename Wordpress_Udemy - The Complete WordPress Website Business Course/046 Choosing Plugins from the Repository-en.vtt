00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:03.850
Sometimes the best plug in for what you need is free.

2
00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:08.280
There might be a light version of a plug in that has all the functionality you need for your project

3
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:14.370
or a developer or team of developers who routinely release and update their free plugins.

4
00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:28.460
Let's start by looking at the Wordpress plugin repository at Wordpress dot org slash plugins.

5
00:00:28.580 --> 00:00:35.450
We've been here before in one of our earlier chapters when we were first setting up our brochure site

6
00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:44.020
with a few free plug ins with forty thousand six 630 plug ins inside the repository.

7
00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:50.660
It's not that easy to narrow down what you need and what are the best plugins in the repository.

8
00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:04.400
they started reporting how many active installs there are on each of these plugins as opposed to how

9
00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:13.790
That shows us that plugins will climb to the top which have more and more active installs as opposed

10
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.500
And if the plugin has been abandoned then that number wouldn't have gotten any smaller.

11
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.990
There's a few things we're looking for within a plug in.

12
00:01:26.010 --> 00:01:33.910
And if I load the acus met plug in from automatic and wordpress this is a comment spam filter plugin

13
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:41.730
that ships with wordpress it comes with every press WordPress org download we would look for in any

14
00:01:45.270 --> 00:01:48.440
Let's look at the number of active installs.

15
00:01:48.630 --> 00:01:57.220
When it was last updated what version of Wordpress it's compatible to and what version of Wordpress

16
00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.540
it requires.

17
00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.320
Hopefully you're only using the latest version of Wordpress and you keep your clients and your sites

18
00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:07.340
updated.

19
00:02:07.360 --> 00:02:13.210
You can also look below at the ratings and look at the total ratings and you can rate how much value

20
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.760
there are compared to five star ratings.

21
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:34.260
programming of the plug in.

22
00:02:34.630 --> 00:02:37.850
You can click through to their profile page on WordPress dot org.

23
00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:43.210
Matt Mullenweg one of the original founders and inventors of WordPress.

24
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:54.450
And you can do a little bit of research on the plug in developers or development teams by going through

25
00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.080
those links there.

26
00:02:58.810 --> 00:03:02.980
You can also look at the support page within WordPress dot org.

27
00:03:03.220 --> 00:03:11.590
These tabs across the top of the content area but below the image and the tagline of the plug in can

28
00:03:18.670 --> 00:03:26.710
plugin actually support it and reply to these posts which are questions and topics by the public who's

29
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:38.160
Let's go back to the Wordpress or plug ins page and do a search for a common type of plug in contact

30
00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:47.070
Here you can see that there are a whole slew of contact form plug ins available for free in the Wordpress

31
00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:56.060
Now if you go through and browse them the first thing I usually look at are how many active installs

32
00:03:56.570 --> 00:03:57.430
does it have.

33
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:07.140
And I can see that I've got a hundred thousand here on the contact form seven honeypot that the contact

34
00:04:13.330 --> 00:04:14.490
Here's 8000.

35
00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.530
Not bad.

36
00:04:17.690 --> 00:04:25.570
I'm looking at 10 right here 40000 30000.

37
00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:29.740
So if we only pick from the ones that have the most active installs.

38
00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:37.850
The second thing I'd look at is the last updated date this contact form 7 pop up response plug in has

39
00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:41.760
last been updated 2 years ago.

40
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:42.500
Not so good.

41
00:04:51.170 --> 00:04:54.950
Not even for version 4 of WordPress.

42
00:04:55.160 --> 00:05:02.350
This one is a contact form 7 pop up response for when somebody hits the submit button.

43
00:05:02.510 --> 00:05:10.350
It will display a validation message like your message was sent successfully in a pop up interesting

44
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:21.810
I just got a free version of a plugin that does this exact thing pop up messages for a contact form

45
00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:29.040
As one of their freebies I think it costs 17 bucks or something.

46
00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:35.070
Anyway if you do click through to a plug in that's been updated more than two years ago it will even

47
00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:43.830
The plug in has not been updated in more than two years and it may not be supported by the developer

48
00:05:46.790 --> 00:05:49.610
Let's look at another category of plug ins.

49
00:05:49.700 --> 00:05:53.360
We've done this before.

50
00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:03.200
For Google Analytics there's another group of plug ins where there's a lot of different plug ins in

51
00:06:03.290 --> 00:06:12.230
this plug in type again a lot of them have thousands or hundreds of thousands of active installs.

52
00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:16.020
And those are the ones that I would choose.

53
00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:22.490
I know that we used Google Analytics by monster insights in our earlier video.

54
00:06:22.550 --> 00:06:31.010
We also have the Google Analytics editor which if we open up the Google Analytics later is powered by

55
00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:44.060
company and we get into using them later in this course.

56
00:06:44.270 --> 00:06:47.280
But this is an example of an excellent plug in.

57
00:06:47.300 --> 00:06:49.390
That's got plenty of installs.

58
00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:55.510
They spend their own time and money keeping it updated compatible with the latest version of Wordpress

59
00:06:55.790 --> 00:07:03.400
because they hope that by using this plug in you'll also look at their other paid offerings.

60
00:07:03.710 --> 00:07:10.040
This is how a lot of the greatest plugins inside the plugin repository get support from development

61
00:07:11.020 --> 00:07:17.900
There are either light versions that have a limited set of functions or not every function is powered

62
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:29.650
and they also might have ADD ons that you can place if you look at the new commerce plug in which commerce

63
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:38.380
But in any case it's still a plug in at this time.

64
00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:48.220
are also a lot of paid add ons from wew.

65
00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:56.390
of the add ons that you need later.

66
00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:04.490
So there's nothing wrong with using a light version of a plug in as long as it gives you the functionalities

67
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.550
that you need.

68
00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:13.410
It's usually supported by a development team that will keep it updated with updates in wordpress.

69
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.580
Here's one that we're going to be able to experience in this course.

70
00:08:23.750 --> 00:08:26.330
with my own sites and with client work.

71
00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:38.210
sandbox and we'll be playing with it later in this course.

72
00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:44.210
But Thomas Griffin here does offer a light version and it is an excellent plug in.

73
00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:49.550
It just doesn't come with every add on that you might want inside of a slider plug in.

74
00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:59.290
That's supported by a development team and it's updated often as Wordpress updates.

75
00:08:59.330 --> 00:09:04.940
One more thing you should know you don't necessarily have to go to the Wordpress dot org slash plug

76
00:09:09.290 --> 00:09:15.760
But if you're within Wordpress and logged in if you go to plug ins and add new it's going to open all

77
00:09:15.780 --> 00:09:22.940
the same information as you can find in the Wordpress dot org plug in repository itself including if

78
00:09:28.820 --> 00:09:32.820
It will open up a modal window in front of your own WordPress installation.

79
00:09:32.990 --> 00:09:39.140
Pulling information from the Web site like the description and some of those tabs across the top the

80
00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:53.630
well as all this essential information when the plug in was last updated and what version it requires

81
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:03.250
Then of course you can install it right into your Wordpress installation with the button right there.

82
00:10:03.260 --> 00:10:06.310
I've already got the latest version of acus met installed.

83
00:10:06.410 --> 00:10:13.400
But what if I wanted to install a bird jetpack by WordPress dotcom I could hit the install but now or

84
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:20.840
Right within my wordpress dashboard and then I can scroll down and install.

85
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:30.160
free plug in from the Wordpress repository.

86
00:10:30.290 --> 00:10:36.530
We looked at a few of the most popular plugin types and found a couple of the best and you saw how you

87
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:49.760
Next we'll return to the locally hosted photography site we've been working with and do some assessments
