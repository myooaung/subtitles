00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.840
In this video you'll get an additional site set up inside your students sandbox area.

2
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:15.070
content for the theme at the end of this lesson.

3
00:00:15.140 --> 00:00:21.230
You'll be ready to begin customizing of themes home page inside your new sandbox site.

4
00:00:26.030 --> 00:00:31.220
You can open this on your own computer to take a look at it while you're setting up your site by going

5
00:00:40.610 --> 00:00:43.660
press will have a demo site for us to look at.

6
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:50.480
So it's filled out with images and content on the home page has been configured so we can see what the

7
00:00:53.210 --> 00:00:58.100
Now if we look at the executive pro theme right here we can see starting at the top.

8
00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:06.890
We have a nice navigation menu with drop downs across the top as well as an example of theme colors.

9
00:01:13.760 --> 00:01:21.240
example the orange will load the themed demo with that orange color which is built into the theme settings

10
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:29.510
as we scroll down you can see that there is a slider here not powered by the soliloquy slider but by

11
00:01:36.710 --> 00:01:38.110
the Genesis themes.

12
00:01:39.090 --> 00:01:47.670
You can use the arrows here to go across and you can click Continue reading or click on the actual slider

13
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:55.280
itself and it opens a post which is associated with that slider image.

14
00:01:56.950 --> 00:01:59.220
I'll hit back and go back to the home page.

15
00:01:59.340 --> 00:02:06.610
But as we go down you can see that the next section is a group of three thumbnail images and content

16
00:02:06.880 --> 00:02:13.030
with the read more link and each of these is associated with a page on the Web site

17
00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:23.550
and you can see each of these interior pages has a main column and a sidebar column one has an e-mail

18
00:02:26.970 --> 00:02:33.630
And here's a list of recent posts and you can see that this footer area that it has the gray background

19
00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:37.330
is also visible on every page of the Web site.

20
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.030
I'll hit back again.

21
00:02:39.180 --> 00:02:47.160
And so you can populate this with any three pages that can call out the benefits or different services

22
00:02:54.230 --> 00:02:56.280
call a call to action banner.

23
00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:02.540
This might be hey contact us today over to the contact page or anything that the business needs that

24
00:03:05.870 --> 00:03:12.830
But as people read and go down they might want people to go to a product page or contact us page or

25
00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:23.930
They can be Pages posts or just fixed content along with thumbnails as well.

26
00:03:24.130 --> 00:03:31.990
And then the footer which is three widgets populated with anything we want but in this case a text widget

27
00:03:39.490 --> 00:03:47.220
So that navigation is easy from the bottom of every page of the Web site sign into your student sandbox

28
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:53.170
students that W.P. of course dotcom offers a lag in button at the top right.

29
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:57.900
Or if you're just at W if you want to go to WAPT of course dot com.

30
00:04:10.790 --> 00:04:16.790
And what we're what we'll be doing is creating an additional site in addition to the site which you

31
00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:23.660
That was your first site at the student's sandbox area.

32
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:39.690
that you set up first and then there's an Add New button by the my site's heading.

33
00:04:39.750 --> 00:04:45.380
You can see the names of sites you're already a member of your first one might be just your name.

34
00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:47.540
WP of course dot com.

35
00:04:47.580 --> 00:04:55.620
And to add another site to your account just choose a domain which should probably have your name and

36
00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:08.310
So it should be your name and then the name of the theme potentially your name executive.

37
00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:14.810
And then you can call it whatever you like for this one I'll call it executive pro and create site large

38
00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:16.590
green button at the bottom.

39
00:05:18.690 --> 00:05:19.140
Great.

40
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:29.670
Your name executive W.P. of course dot com and so you log in as your name and your existing password.

41
00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:42.960
You'll have the same user account that will work for each one of your sites inside of the student's

42
00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:52.540
Now if I go under my sites I can see that I have the parallax pro original and the executive pro right

43
00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:58.250
And so I'm already logged into the executive pro dashboard area.

44
00:05:58.450 --> 00:06:04.960
And the next thing we want to do is download the theme demo files appear at the top.

45
00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:10.330
I've added a themed demo files link where if you click that it's just going to go ahead and download

46
00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:19.600
a zip file that contains all of the theme demo files that we need to import into each of our sites to

47
00:06:22.090 --> 00:06:26.120
This is just a zip file that you can uncompress or unzip.

48
00:06:26.140 --> 00:06:33.070
Once it's downloaded onto your computer it's downloaded into my downloads folder and I'll just click

49
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.390
it into another spot on my computer.

50
00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:48.950
Here on my desktop as you know I've been creating folders for some of the sites that we've been working

51
00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:59.090
And so I've created a new folder called Demo content and I'll just drag that zip file over into that

52
00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.950
folder onto my desktop.

53
00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:08.600
If you're on Windows you can right click and click extract all and that will unzip or uncompress the

54
00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:21.040
open it open the archive utility and you'll be able to unzip that zip file.

55
00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:26.720
Now that zip file that you just unzipped you may have noticed contains just a bunch of files with the

56
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:38.480
Those are SML files that we use to import sight sample content into WordPress using the Wordpress importer.

57
00:07:38.630 --> 00:07:44.840
If you remember when we created our brochure site originally we imported some content into our local

58
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:57.920
This time we'll be activating the executive pro theme inside of your new students sandbox site and using

59
00:08:06.130 --> 00:08:16.240
your new site at the sandbox go over to appearance themes and go down and find the executive pro theme

60
00:08:16.300 --> 00:08:17.690
and activate it.

61
00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:21.800
There it is.

62
00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:23.140
I can just click activate

63
00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:35.950
and now this theme has not been has not been configured and the home page him page hasn't been customized

64
00:08:35.980 --> 00:08:40.870
or anything like that but he'd be a good idea just to look at the theme itself.

65
00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.560
Just so I can have a starting point.

66
00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:58.650
Now this is the content that I placed inside the original new site that I have you guys download every

67
00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:09.870
Obviously the widgets are probably in the wrong places and we don't really want to use all of this widget

68
00:09:14.630 --> 00:09:21.120
Now that the executive pro theme is active Let's go ahead and import the sample content.

69
00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:30.140
Under tools you have a button called import and this is very much like the way that we imported content

70
00:09:32.210 --> 00:09:38.700
A few chapters back but I've got the Wordpress importer available to you here inside the student student

71
00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:54.190
Now while I do that I found the executive Procol SML file from that zip file that we unzipped on my

72
00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:05.740
one thing that we do want to do is download and import the file attachments so that we have all the

73
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:15.130
And I might as well select myself as the author on any of these authors that come in for any of these

74
00:10:16.930 --> 00:10:19.270
So I hit submit great.

75
00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.840
All done have fun.

76
00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:27.730
Now there won't be any changes visible on the site yet because we have it switched around the home page

77
00:10:29.800 --> 00:10:36.250
But if we go into our dashboard and look at pages for example there'll be some new pages that have been

78
00:10:44.950 --> 00:10:46.090
theme.

79
00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:58.660
and that they're all just grey squares.

80
00:10:58.840 --> 00:10:59.940
Let's look at one of them.

81
00:10:59.950 --> 00:11:03.490
This is to keep the file size down as we can figure the files.

82
00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:21.040
are just gray instead of having beautiful imagery but they are very small file sizes and you can also

83
00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:28.420
use those images to configure the different pages and the different places on the Web site that need

84
00:11:28.510 --> 00:11:30.090
imagery.

85
00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:36.440
If we look at the demo content when we fill out our home page all of these images here will be filled

86
00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:49.510
And you may have noticed that there's a new type of post called portfolio that Genesys executive pro

87
00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:03.580
If you look at the theme demo you can see that there's a portfolio page accessible here under page templates

88
00:12:04.030 --> 00:12:09.000
templates and called Portfolio page and it has featured items.

89
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:17.110
If you click one it opens a portfolio section that is displayed in a certain way with the featured image.

90
00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:23.600
Larger in this video you sign up for a new sandbox site inside your account at W.P..

91
00:12:23.670 --> 00:12:30.270
Of course dotcom and activated the executive pro theme then you downloaded the theme demo files and

92
00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:41.770
Next you'll build out the home page using the themes provided widget areas and explore other theme options
