1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:07,730
Like category's tags are a taxonomy or a way to place content into a group or a type tags are generally

2
00:00:09,530 --> 00:00:14,770
And this video will experiment with them and set up a navigation convention called a tag cloud.

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:20,210
By the end of this video you'll understand how and why to use tags by setting them up in your own local

4
00:00:23,060 --> 00:00:23,960
Let's get started.

5
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,810
We'll first explore how tags are displayed in our existing 2014 say in the photography site.

6
00:00:30,870 --> 00:00:37,740
So make sure that map is running and you can open up the Wordpress dashboard and the site in a different

7
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:47,370
Navigate to the home page and if you scroll down some of the posts that we imported using our ex-MIL

8
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:57,350
And these are down here at the bottom of each displayed area of each post.

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,330
They have a slightly different looking little graphic background like a little tag on there.

10
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:09,780
And if I roll over one of them and you look at the bottom left hand side of the screen you can see that

11
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:17,170
it's the R L slash tag slash alignment to is what this one is called.

12
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,610
Sometimes if you have a category for example by the name of alignment and then after creating that category

13
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:25,460
you create a tag called an alignment.

14
00:01:25,470 --> 00:01:28,100
It will make the u r l have a dash too.

15
00:01:28,170 --> 00:01:30,950
So there's no conflicting yourselves.

16
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:39,300
If I click on one of the tags here this will show me an archive page of all the posts that are tagged

17
00:01:49,080 --> 00:01:51,990
image horizontal so it looks like I have.

18
00:01:52,230 --> 00:01:59,700
Well it shows me 3 on a page and I have 3 pages so I'm up to nine different posts are tagged with the

19
00:02:03,060 --> 00:02:12,060
Now let's go back into the Wordpress dashboard and look under the posts menu item and click tags.

20
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:23,770
We imported a bunch of posts that are tagged through our sample SML import so we can use these existing

21
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:31,590
This on the left is an example of a tag cloud.

22
00:02:31,690 --> 00:02:37,720
They use font size as a hierarchy with the larger fonts for tags with more posts.

23
00:02:43,330 --> 00:02:47,970
will place a tag club like this on the sidebar of our Web site.

24
00:02:48,550 --> 00:02:50,140
Similar categories.

25
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:55,210
A tag is added through this add new tag field right here.

26
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:07,170
The real name for the web address and they can also have a description one of the general differences

27
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:18,300
You can see that there's a hundred and eleven items here.

28
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,630
content within a post.

29
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:38,700
Generally posts that are tagged will have a whole lot of tags that describe very specific types of content

30
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:48,330
about the posts that they describe and post will also be categorized in one or maybe two categories.

31
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:57,600
So if we look inside these existing category tags you can see that some of them have one two or three

32
00:03:58,320 --> 00:03:58,920
posts.

33
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:09,410
And as we go down you can see that there's just a whole lot of different tags.

34
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:18,900
And once you begin to tag posts you can really start to use existing tags to tag other posts that you're

35
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,110
Or if the client is using a blog it's a really good way to provide a different intuitive reference as

36
00:04:35,180 --> 00:04:38,750
or does not have some tags let's just go ahead and open one that doesn't.

37
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:46,250
The HELLO WORLD post that we have on the front page of our site and under a post editing page tags are

38
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:56,840
And this one does not have any tags but it has a couple of different conventions that allow you to choose

39
00:04:59,150 --> 00:05:02,660
You can click Choose from the most used tags.

40
00:05:02,780 --> 00:05:09,590
Now that'll give you a tag cloud of some of the most used tags just like was on the tags page at the

41
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,740
And if you click any of these it will go ahead and use that tag.

42
00:05:20,030 --> 00:05:27,380
Go ahead and say OK this one is in the content tag and it's also in the love tag are tagged with the

43
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:34,280
And if you're looking for a specific tag it may not be in this list if there's a whole lot of tags in

44
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:43,140
But if you just start typing a series of letters if there's a tag that starts with those letters it

45
00:05:43,270 --> 00:05:44,730
will show you.

46
00:05:44,930 --> 00:05:45,440
There we go.

47
00:05:47,260 --> 00:05:51,100
And you can separate tags with commas or you can just click add.

48
00:05:51,290 --> 00:05:54,070
And here's this group of tags for my post.

49
00:05:54,200 --> 00:05:55,460
Hello world.

50
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,160
world post here can see that now.

51
00:06:08,360 --> 00:06:10,480
It's populated with these tags.

52
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:18,140
I can see what other posts have been tagged with the word love and that can help users to you to be

53
00:06:22,760 --> 00:06:29,120
Again tags are a taxonomy that are navigated in a certain way and it's another way besides categories

54
00:06:29,450 --> 00:06:37,360
to put each of the posts in a web site or a blog into a certain type.

55
00:06:37,450 --> 00:06:40,190
I do have a challenge for you in this video.

56
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:49,620
What I'd like you to do is populate this content sidebar with a tag cloud see how you get on and I'll

57
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:55,240
How do you do with your tag cloud.

58
00:06:56,260 --> 00:07:02,680
Well you may have found that there's actually a widget type built into WordPress called tag cloud.

59
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:10,460
You may have actually seen it in earlier video but if I just go to appearance widgets I know that that

60
00:07:10,640 --> 00:07:17,180
sidebar is called the content side bar and look and see that that's where I have the photo categories

61
00:07:17,270 --> 00:07:25,090
widget and right over here is a tag cloud widget that I can drag in and place below the categories widget.

62
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:32,170
I can give it a title maybe I just call it tags or if I don't want to do that I might even just call

63
00:07:34,180 --> 00:07:42,190
Now the taxonomy when you use a cloud you can actually choose from tags categories or link categories

64
00:07:42,760 --> 00:07:44,950
and tags is what we're going to use now.

65
00:07:45,040 --> 00:07:52,780
But you could arrange categories if you had a lot of them into a cloud like font size type of display.

66
00:07:58,030 --> 00:08:05,290
And if I refresh the page as you know these these sidebars show on every page of the Web site and so

67
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:08,660
There it is.

68
00:08:08,710 --> 00:08:11,360
Let's see how it looks on the home page as well.

69
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:14,480
Great.

70
00:08:15,490 --> 00:08:23,150
Now it doesn't give you that many choices for how many tags that it's going to display and which tags

71
00:08:24,740 --> 00:08:30,600
You can find plugins that manage tags and display of tags in some different ways.

72
00:08:30,620 --> 00:08:34,830
We're going to get into some more of that advance stuff later in the course.

73
00:08:35,090 --> 00:08:42,320
Also by rolling over the tag and letting the little tool tip come up it'll tell you how many topics

74
00:08:42,410 --> 00:08:46,810
are tagged how many posts are tagged with that word.

75
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:56,320
So the small font only has one largest post formats has 16 medium one is to this one over here is 6.

76
00:08:56,340 --> 00:08:57,840
So you can see how that works.

77
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:04,450
And if you click one of the tags it of course brings you to the tag archive's as I mentioned before

78
00:09:04,820 --> 00:09:06,960
and it'll show you a list.

79
00:09:07,130 --> 00:09:13,190
And of course in my settings and previous video we chose to show no more than three posts on a single

80
00:09:19,580 --> 00:09:20,450
and I've got.

81
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,420
In this video you learn how tags are different from category's even though they are both taxonomies

82
00:09:34,630 --> 00:09:40,810
within WordPress for displaying and navigating to different types of content and you place your own

83
00:09:46,490 --> 00:09:52,700
In the next lesson we'll wrap up this chapter and this website by adding two more footer widgets to

84
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:03,380
We'll finish with a discussion about what to do with all that extra stuff we brought in with the content

85
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:04,970
Once the Web site's done
