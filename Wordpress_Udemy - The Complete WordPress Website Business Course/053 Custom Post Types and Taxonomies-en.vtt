00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.210
In this video we'll dive into the custom post type that's built into the executive pro theme called

2
00:00:13.740 --> 00:00:15.920
a plugin and you'll discover why that is.

3
00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:17.760
And check out a powerful plugin for this.

4
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:25.320
By the end of this video you'll understand custom post types why you can and should use them for certain

5
00:00:29.430 --> 00:00:34.710
Let's start by opening our second site we've been working with inside the student's sandbox and the

6
00:00:41.370 --> 00:00:47.310
was I selected under dashboard my sites where you could click up here in the admin bar and I looked

7
00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:56.390
clicked Save Changes that way when I log in.

8
00:00:56.410 --> 00:00:58.850
It will always open the latest site.

9
00:00:58.860 --> 00:01:04.170
The one that I've been working on you can go in and make that change in your own student's sandbox area

10
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.010
if you like.

11
00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:12.660
And as we experimented with and checked out in the last video let's look at this portfolio section and

12
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:26.520
because we imported the executive pro SML file for sample content with these items and we've looked

13
00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:39.420
If you remember in the demo under page templates there was a portfolio page sample and these each of

14
00:01:47.970 --> 00:01:49.950
a portfolio page.

15
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:57.000
And that is a post type if we go and look back inside of the Wordpress dashboard we've got a certain

16
00:02:00.390 --> 00:02:06.720
Another post type called pages built into Wordpress and now there's been a custom post type created

17
00:02:07.020 --> 00:02:12.360
as a part of the executive pro-team called portfolio.

18
00:02:12.470 --> 00:02:19.760
Now as we've learned the posts post type built into WordPress has two taxonomies associated with it

19
00:02:20.060 --> 00:02:27.750
categories which is a hierarchical type of taxonomy as compared to tag's which is non hierarchical.

20
00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:33.740
Basically it just means that Ketterer categories can have a hierarchy where there can be parent categories

21
00:02:41.690 --> 00:02:45.670
so they're a non hierarchical type of taxonomy.

22
00:02:45.890 --> 00:02:53.350
Inside the custom portfolio post type there is actually only one hierarchical taxonomy.

23
00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:59.390
So it's just like categories but it's called types or portfolio types.

24
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:10.310
a second type in here called portrait's.

25
00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:25.250
The archive is just the listing page of all portfolio items and there is a in an archive page template

26
00:03:25.460 --> 00:03:30.280
built into the theme that displays all the portfolio items in a certain way.

27
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:32.410
It's called the portfolio archive.

28
00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:37.510
And if you roll over the link here you can see the URL at the bottom left.

29
00:03:37.730 --> 00:03:43.280
And if you just right click and open that in a new tab we've looked at this before the portfolio page

30
00:03:43.550 --> 00:03:47.780
displays a full width page with three items across.

31
00:03:55.730 --> 00:03:59.110
WordPress template built into the theme itself.

32
00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:07.820
There's a few different fields built into the portfolio archive template that are editable and this

33
00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:20.700
If I want a headline for my portfolio page this might just say portfolio items.

34
00:04:20.900 --> 00:04:29.660
And then here would be a description and if we just save settings and take a look at the portfolio archive

35
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:35.310
we'll see where that archive headline and archive intro text appear.

36
00:04:35.330 --> 00:04:36.930
I've just hit back and there it is.

37
00:04:36.980 --> 00:04:44.490
So I can have an announcement at the top of all the portfolio items for its archive page if we go back

38
00:04:52.170 --> 00:04:58.280
settings provided by the theme in this custom post type and taxonomy system where you can have an archive

39
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:01.590
headline and an archive intro text.

40
00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:18.630
portfolio Desch type that is the builtin you are l and then you could put slash landscape's.

41
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.590
Now we've opened up all the portfolio items in the landscape category or the landscape portfolio type.

42
00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:31.380
Here's the URL and I did place this information inside of the archive settings.

43
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:37.210
And this is the description on the archive page.

44
00:05:37.330 --> 00:05:43.740
So having seen how custom post types works a little bit inside of this theme.

45
00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:48.560
Let's take a look at what WordPress has about custom post types.

46
00:05:51.010 --> 00:05:55.040
I just search for post types and I found this post types page.

47
00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:59.710
And if you read this it gives you a little bit of detail about how to create those types in terms of

48
00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:09.130
But there's an important piece of advice down here after the descriptions a word about custom postholes

49
00:06:09.220 --> 00:06:10.610
as a plug in.

50
00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:16.660
The thing about custom post types is that you're most likely going to create different types or categories

51
00:06:22.930 --> 00:06:24.880
within your client's Web sites.

52
00:06:32.740 --> 00:06:37.900
types system is built into the theme when they change their theme they're going to lose their customisations

53
00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.970
and all their custom post types.

54
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:52.120
types as a plug in and instead of inside of the theme.

55
00:06:52.270 --> 00:06:57.790
Now executive Frot is a little bit of an older theme that does define custom posed types within the

56
00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:06.000
And if we wanted to create our own custom post types within any type of theme we can use a certain plug

57
00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:13.300
There are some free plug in and there's also a premium plug in that I'll show you in this video.

58
00:07:21.980 --> 00:07:30.140
up appearance themes inside of the student's sandbox you'll see the assortment of all of the pro studio

59
00:07:31.130 --> 00:07:36.200
And there's one called Author pro and the author pro theme there.

60
00:07:40.730 --> 00:07:49.010
And there's a custom post type and custom taxonomies built in to the author pro plugin which is associated

61
00:07:52.820 --> 00:08:00.170
They've produced a plugin called Author pro plugin that can produce custom taxonomies as well as custom

62
00:08:06.110 --> 00:08:13.430
However the author pro theme is the one that it was designed to work with first now inside my client's

63
00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:21.870
I'm in the Wordpress dashboard under plug ins and you can see one of the first ones here that I have

64
00:08:26.070 --> 00:08:31.380
If we look under WordPress dot org we can see that it's one of the plug ins in the plug in repository

65
00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:40.220
Genesis author pro is designed to attractively display book details in single pages and archive pages.

66
00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.610
And so there's a description of what it does here.

67
00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:51.090
It creates a post-it custom post type called books and a library and it creates some different taxonomies

68
00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:55.200
and it has some different display that it does on the Web site.

69
00:08:55.290 --> 00:08:56.770
And I'll show you how that works.

70
00:08:57.730 --> 00:09:04.450
Let's look at the Custom post type inside of the fun middle school plays WordPress dashboard.

71
00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:13.810
And while it's normally called books I've done a text change here using the ultimate branding plugin

72
00:09:14.170 --> 00:09:19.000
to change the word books to plays just because she writes plays scripts.

73
00:09:19.270 --> 00:09:23.310
But it's the same thing there's a custom type called plays.

74
00:09:23.410 --> 00:09:25.300
And let's look at that here.

75
00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:28.400
I just clicked all place and she's got some.

76
00:09:28.410 --> 00:09:36.580
All of these plays in here and it looks just like a post listing page or pages listing page but it's

77
00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.760
Now there's some different taxonomies.

78
00:09:48.910 --> 00:09:50.770
book's web site.

79
00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.280
There is a play series or this would be the book series.

80
00:09:58.060 --> 00:10:07.580
Now series is a hierarchical taxonomy just like categories if you can see down here Western melodrama.

81
00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:15.520
This is one taxonomy or you could call it a category one play series and then these two trilogies sit

82
00:10:15.580 --> 00:10:18.220
within this category.

83
00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:30.190
If you look at the live Web site that I'm building and we look at the menus here under Uplay scripts

84
00:10:30.280 --> 00:10:38.710
holiday plays there's Western melodramas and then there's two more subcategories or sub series under

85
00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:49.540
If I just click the holiday place category which is a place series it will list all the players in the

86
00:10:54.990 --> 00:10:58.920
Let's go back to the dashboard and we can look at authors as well.

87
00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:08.930
Authors are also a hierarchical taxonomy built in to the author pro Plug-In And then there is just a

88
00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:21.870
And there's also a separate tag's system built in to the posts post type which comes with wordpress

89
00:11:22.310 --> 00:11:24.090
But these tags are separate.

90
00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:30.260
And then there's also an archive setting's page just like we explored inside the executive profe theme.

91
00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:39.150
some Lorem some text.

92
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.500
If I go to the plays archive page let's go back to the live site.

93
00:11:44.510 --> 00:11:51.970
Now if I just click all play script that gives me that archive headline and this is the archive intro

94
00:11:56.920 --> 00:12:01.840
Part of the library back in the Wordpress dashboard.

95
00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:08.860
I just want to point out in this case because I'm using a plugin that controls these custom posed types

96
00:12:16.390 --> 00:12:22.720
to I could change to a totally different Genesys theme and configure this Web site within a totally

97
00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:35.040
And I will still have all of these custom prototypes and taxonomies available to me inside of the Web

98
00:12:42.990 --> 00:12:50.200
One is a premium plug in that I use through WBM you Dev and it's called Custom press custom press plug

99
00:12:57.180 --> 00:13:00.870
press is a very powerful custom post types plug in.

100
00:13:08.340 --> 00:13:15.700
it into any theme using short codes as well as theme files for styling each custom post type.

101
00:13:16.080 --> 00:13:22.590
If you go to WordPress dot org and the plug in directory or the plugin repository and search for custom

102
00:13:23.730 --> 00:13:30.510
One of the top ones will be a very popular probably the best free custom post type plug in there is

103
00:13:30.810 --> 00:13:36.530
by web dev studios the custom post type UI plug in.

104
00:13:36.630 --> 00:13:45.330
Now their free version here isn't quite as powerful as the custom press plugin or as powerful as their

105
00:13:47.290 --> 00:13:54.300
There's actually the custom post type extended costs I think $19 at this time and it gives you an easy

106
00:14:00.150 --> 00:14:03.590
That's the power of this premium plug in from WPA udev.

107
00:14:03.690 --> 00:14:10.530
It makes it easy for styling and fitting your custom post types into any theme.

108
00:14:10.760 --> 00:14:15.950
In any case the custom pulse type UI is a great one to start with you can bring it in to your local

109
00:14:16.130 --> 00:14:25.260
environment or into your life sites and play with creating custom post types for free using this plugin.

110
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:30.910
In this video you saw some different applications for custom post types in wordpress and we looked at

111
00:14:33.250 --> 00:14:38.140
You also explored the custom taxonomies that can come along with a post type and learn the difference

112
00:14:40.990 --> 00:14:48.490
Taxonomies I also introduced three options for a ACP or custom post type plug in the Genesis author

113
00:14:57.430 --> 00:15:02.850
Don't worry we're not done with custom pulse types will be diving into them in detail in another chapter.

114
00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:08.730
In the next lesson we'll begin to wrap up our corporate style website using the executive pro theme

115
00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.420
by formatting the home page differently and configuring a blog archive page
