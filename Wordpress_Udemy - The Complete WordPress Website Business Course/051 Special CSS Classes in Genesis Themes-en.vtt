00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.350
In this video we'll explore a set of styles built into Genesis themes for creating different column

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:09.050
layouts in any content area.

3
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:21.440
we use them to style the content in the call to action section of the executive pro home page.

4
00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:26.630
By the end of this lesson you'll understand how to use the predefined column classes to make it easy

5
00:00:30.850 --> 00:00:33.910
Let's start by opening up the site we've been working on.

6
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.640
to the correct site because by now you should have two sites within your students sandbox.

7
00:00:49.690 --> 00:00:52.400
So if your original one is the one that opens first.

8
00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:57.610
Make sure you navigate to executive pro or the second one that we've been working on in this chapter

9
00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:01.250
and click dashboard.

10
00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:08.890
Now that that's open let's take a look at a certain page that we used the importer to import into our

11
00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:12.510
It's called Kollam classes in my installation.

12
00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:17.190
It's the first one because it starts with the letter C.

13
00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:24.480
Now if we open that page and edit it you can see that there's not really any columns visible inside

14
00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:32.630
In fact there's just you know four sections of text and six sections of text.

15
00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:39.690
But if you right click on the permalink and open in a new tab and take a look at the column class's

16
00:01:47.450 --> 00:01:55.870
is three and there's four and then there's six columns so the column classes are defined in a CSSA style

17
00:01:58.110 --> 00:02:05.400
And once you know how to use them you can arrange your content in a widget area or in the content area

18
00:02:10.210 --> 00:02:17.380
Back inside of the Wordpress dashboard on the editing page for the column classes page if we go to the

19
00:02:25.990 --> 00:02:30.720
and you can see that this is the way that the column classes are defined.

20
00:02:30.910 --> 00:02:38.320
They're defined with what's called a div and then you define a class with an equal sign a quotation

21
00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:47.860
And if it's the first one a space and then the word first with a closing quote and a closing carrot

22
00:02:56.710 --> 00:03:04.800
to then close the div when you're done by using a slash inside of the carrot's before the word div.

23
00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:08.980
And so the whole piece of code looks like this.

24
00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:23.620
the door of using a slash div inside of greater than and less than characters in on your keyboard.

25
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:30.340
Now you don't always have to type all of your code when you're defining some different classes within

26
00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:38.330
Genesis or any WordPress theme or framework but this page has been imported in here to make it convenient

27
00:03:44.670 --> 00:03:51.290
Now studio press provides some code snippets when you're a member of studio press.

28
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:59.130
You can log in and get all the theme instructions and a whole bunch of code snippets and different instructions

29
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:10.530
But even without being a member studio press does post inside of get hub as a just which is basically

30
00:04:10.740 --> 00:04:17.220
just a section of code that they can make available at the get have Web site Web site for people to

31
00:04:18.810 --> 00:04:26.240
But inside of the studio press account get Herb their just's are listed here and there's 82 of them

32
00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:34.950
and there's just an assortment of ones some of her specific themes like atmosphere author pro alt. pro

33
00:04:35.790 --> 00:04:42.150
and on the third or fourth page I think as you scroll down that you can go to older gests and look at

34
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:53.910
Sometimes there's actually more than one file within a just if I click these three files or click the

35
00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:09.860
down through to the third or fourth page and I found this a set of just two of them for the executive

36
00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.820
The call to action banner has this piece of content inside it.

37
00:05:16.070 --> 00:05:23.020
I'm going to go ahead and copy it by highlighting the whole thing and having control-C.

38
00:05:23.140 --> 00:05:31.810
Now this is located at just dot get hub dot com slash studio press and you can browse through and find

39
00:05:32.080 --> 00:05:38.740
the executive projects on the third or fourth page or you can have this inside the address bar the number

40
00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.580
6 6 0 2 8 1 1 to find this piece of code.

41
00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:49.030
I'll also make these pieces of codes and every piece of code that we use within the course available

42
00:05:49.270 --> 00:05:56.940
in the course material and on the resources pages so I've copied this piece of code and I'm going to

43
00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:06.630
we were working before in the customized.

44
00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:14.520
So I've hit appearance customize and as that opens I'll go to the widgets areas if you remember we were

45
00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:22.590
And here's the call to action section.

46
00:06:24.630 --> 00:06:31.440
I just have a text widget here with a contact us for a title and then the content here I'm just going

47
00:06:37.950 --> 00:06:39.630
click paste.

48
00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:47.340
And here's the divs with the class three fourths first and then the second one the second div is one

49
00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:56.310
So not only can you do a set of two columns or a set of three columns or a set of four but you could

50
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:13.050
do a four six and then a one sixth and another a one sixth and will experiment with that just a little

51
00:07:21.340 --> 00:07:26.550
So I hope you're following along and you found this piece of code in one of the two places I outlined

52
00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:33.600
and pasted it into the call to action widget in a text widget and call that what you want let's just

53
00:07:35.940 --> 00:07:44.220
We've got a carrot and a div and then a space and we've defined a class by stating the word class equals

54
00:07:44.250 --> 00:07:52.740
quotation and then we're working with three fourths and then a space is that space and then the word

55
00:07:53.820 --> 00:08:01.620
And so we're telling Genesys that we want this piece of content that is inside the div to take up three

56
00:08:09.330 --> 00:08:15.350
So three fourths is first and then the next div will define the next piece of content.

57
00:08:15.510 --> 00:08:23.220
So then there's just plain text inside the div characters with these little greater than and less than

58
00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.220
symbols.

59
00:08:24.450 --> 00:08:31.960
And then we've closed the div with a slash before the word div inside of the carrots.

60
00:08:32.490 --> 00:08:37.590
So by doing that we're saying OK that's all for the content in the three fourths area.

61
00:08:44.710 --> 00:08:51.340
You know we use the lessons symbol and div with a space and class equals quotation.

62
00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:59.130
One fourth and these are defined with a either plural or not and with a dash as is appropriate for the

63
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:05.150
So it's three fourths first and then one fourth is the next.

64
00:09:05.550 --> 00:09:10.050
And then there's an ending quotation and an ending greater than symbol.

65
00:09:10.230 --> 00:09:16.800
And then inside of here is another class that has been defined for us inside of Genesis.

66
00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.800
different styles of the theme are button classes.

67
00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:32.840
So we've defined a link by putting a as for anchor.

68
00:09:32.880 --> 00:09:38.880
An anchor is a link that is clickable and it's anchored to something it's anchored to an HIV M-L page

69
00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.950
or some kind of a web you r l so that when you click it the site will do something.

70
00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:47.460
We're learning a little bit of HVM L here.

71
00:09:54.930 --> 00:09:55.430
class.

72
00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:58.380
The class here is button.

73
00:09:58.650 --> 00:10:00.650
And then we want it to be aligned right.

74
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:05.840
What if I arrange that to align left.

75
00:10:05.910 --> 00:10:09.930
Is it going to come all the way over here on the Contact Us section.

76
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.230
But you can see that it's shifted to the left there.

77
00:10:18.710 --> 00:10:26.240
There's another class for buttons and I can do all one word line center and you can see that it places

78
00:10:32.690 --> 00:10:33.820
the bottom.

79
00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:39.710
So when we align a button to the center not only does it a line in the content area left and right but

80
00:10:43.050 --> 00:10:49.190
So I'm going to just go ahead and change that back to align right and you'll see that this whole block

81
00:10:49.220 --> 00:10:53.360
becomes a little bit shorter because it's just placed right there.

82
00:10:53.390 --> 00:11:02.240
If I extend C I'm just going to copy that piece of text and repeat it a couple times.

83
00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:09.600
If I put more text there it will just extend the content area down lower and you can see with this button

84
00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:14.880
It places it at the top of the content area.

85
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.490
But if I had a lot of copy here and I thought boy I want that button to be centered up and down I could

86
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:30.770
Great.

87
00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:38.140
So the way that you finish a an anchor tag which is a link is that after you define the class you close

88
00:11:43.690 --> 00:11:49.900
The first one because you close and open an anchor tag a little bit differently but HGF is for the hyperlink

89
00:11:50.590 --> 00:11:52.330
This is where you put the link.

90
00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.620
to anything.

91
00:12:01.800 --> 00:12:03.790
And so that's just kind of a placeholder there.

92
00:12:03.930 --> 00:12:10.980
I would actually place my contact page if I knew my contact page if it was up here and I could right

93
00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:27.360
So then you close the initial carrot or the initial less than symbol with a greater than symbol to define.

94
00:12:27.370 --> 00:12:34.230
OK here's the anchor and then right after the greater than symbol you place whatever text you want to

95
00:12:35.910 --> 00:12:41.790
And by defining it like this that whole button is clickable wherever you roll your mouse over even just

96
00:12:47.220 --> 00:12:52.700
you hover the cursor or your mouse over it you can see that it changes color just a little bit.

97
00:12:54.350 --> 00:13:01.010
And then after you have the text that you want inside the button you close the anchor tag again with

98
00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:07.840
a slash before the inside of the open and close or the greater then the lesson symbols.

99
00:13:08.150 --> 00:13:14.780
And then of course we've got to close the div as well so that we were finishing out with the last one

100
00:13:22.170 --> 00:13:26.820
So I hope you followed along a little bit takes some time and pause the video if you need to and arrange

101
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:30.000
your contact us call to action area.

102
00:13:30.090 --> 00:13:37.620
Experimenting with that button code and with the columns code just a little bit I'm going to go in and

103
00:13:45.030 --> 00:13:50.260
makes sense and connect this to our contact page in a later video.

104
00:13:50.340 --> 00:13:52.190
But I'm going to leave it at a line right.

105
00:13:52.380 --> 00:13:59.470
And just a small amount of text up there and I've got a nice pretty call to action right here and I'll

106
00:13:59.490 --> 00:14:04.490
hit save and publish inside the Customize her and then I can just close that customized.

107
00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:10.830
And let's go back to the column class's page and create a new page of our own.

108
00:14:16.230 --> 00:14:24.120
and you're like well I want I want to divide it up into thirds so I'm going to go ahead and take everything

109
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:36.280
And now go ahead and follow along and let's add a new page to the Web site.

110
00:14:38.360 --> 00:14:42.300
I'm just going to name it something obvious like three columns.

111
00:14:44.280 --> 00:14:50.010
And when I paste some code into here I've got to make sure that I'm on the text editing.

112
00:14:50.040 --> 00:14:57.090
I can tell because I've just got a few little buttons here where I can use this to make bold bold h

113
00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:04.880
DML tag and then I could type something and then I can close the tag with these HVM l buttons up here.

114
00:15:05.160 --> 00:15:07.200
I'm just going to take out make sure that I'm on the text.

115
00:15:14.490 --> 00:15:15.460
processor.

116
00:15:15.480 --> 00:15:21.690
This is how you open up the second line the toolbar toggle to get to your headings and things like that

117
00:15:22.260 --> 00:15:24.690
for any of your code or any of your text.

118
00:15:24.720 --> 00:15:28.400
But let's go to the text editing tab.

119
00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:35.630
And I'm going to put the cursor there and hit Control V and paste my ONE-THIRD first one third and then

120
00:15:38.690 --> 00:15:40.620
And it's got some example text.

121
00:15:40.640 --> 00:15:48.700
So really I could just publish this and then take a look at it on the page by clicking here I'm going

122
00:15:54.740 --> 00:16:03.030
There you go so there is a page that's got three columns inside of this content area and a sidebar on

123
00:16:04.290 --> 00:16:05.800
Now what's the difference here.

124
00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:11.310
McCollam classes page here is set up a little bit differently.

125
00:16:14.730 --> 00:16:21.410
Let's just look at how that set up and we'll finish with this lesson I'm going to go ahead and get two

126
00:16:29.030 --> 00:16:40.300
OK copy and I'll go back to the page where I was here and now drove to paste by Laura amid some text

127
00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:43.090
and then if I hit update I can save it.

128
00:16:44.650 --> 00:16:47.280
See that it's within the ONE-THIRD first.

129
00:16:47.380 --> 00:16:49.160
And the closing div..

130
00:16:49.180 --> 00:16:49.990
Perfect.

131
00:16:53.890 --> 00:17:03.410
And then I can see that if I go to my three columns page and refresh it I've got all my text just in

132
00:17:08.120 --> 00:17:15.110
Now if I open up that page to edit as well I can see that as I scroll down Genesis gives me some layout

133
00:17:20.690 --> 00:17:25.040
It's actually set at using the primary sidebar because I can see that it's set at the default settings

134
00:17:25.430 --> 00:17:32.720
and we're using the sidebar widget area here and we can arrange that how we want if I wanted to actually

135
00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:35.070
override the default layout.

136
00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:42.500
I could just click that one on the right which is a full width and update the page and I can just override

137
00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:51.680
screen.

138
00:17:57.410 --> 00:18:03.470
You experimented with the Genesis column classes that are defined by default in the Genesis framework

139
00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:11.140
and you used a version of the classes to arrange the content of the call to action section of the site.

140
00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:17.990
So it looks nice in the next lesson you'll arrange content in the header and footer areas of the site

141
00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:20.070
including creating the navigation buttons
