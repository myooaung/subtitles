00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:06.910
In this video we'll start organizing the cafe pro theme as if we're building it for a photographer with

2
00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:20.180
can use the site to organize images in a specific way by planning how the site needs to arrange and

3
00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:28.040
You'll have a roadmap for how to create your custom post type by going through this process you'll see

4
00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:34.160
No matter what theme you are using WordPress can manage content however the client or web site visitor

5
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:37.090
needs it to be organize.

6
00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.510
Let's start by taking a look at a test site I've made on my local development environment.

7
00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:46.760
The WP dev course to WordPress installation.

8
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:53.120
It's a Genesys site with the cafe theme which should look pretty familiar to you here but it's not on

9
00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:55.230
our students sandbox area.

10
00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:01.460
I've been playing with it in my local environment to show you how you can set up custom post types using

11
00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:12.530
I'll be logging back in to the student sandbox area and going through the steps with you so that you

12
00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:20.970
like.

13
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.870
We're going to be setting this up as if we're doing it for a photographer and as we scroll down on the

14
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:43.400
add one of them I activated with an image and some copy and a link to a photo type.

15
00:01:43.490 --> 00:01:50.190
I made a custom post type called photographs and I made a taxonomy called Photo types.

16
00:01:50.210 --> 00:01:56.540
We're basically going to be categorizing the photographer's photographs into four different categories.

17
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:15.250
So I just clicked that button that led me to the category page or the custom post type page called dogs.

18
00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.350
You can see that it's W.P. of course to slash photo underscore type and then slash.

19
00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:25.730
Dogs and dogs is the name of the custom taxonomy.

20
00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:38.090
But if you look at the display page what I've got is a certain individual post which is one of the photographs

21
00:02:40.790 --> 00:02:46.210
I've got a photograph of a dog some content here and you can see down on the left hand side.

22
00:02:46.310 --> 00:02:47.740
It's filed under dogs.

23
00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.760
This is the page we're looking at right now.

24
00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.080
And on the right hand side it's tagged with a couple of tags.

25
00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.470
So I've got three posts here so far each of them is clickable through the title or the link.

26
00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:16.210
width image as well as a footer that comes up with some data about the image itself.

27
00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.550
Now these are using custom fields.

28
00:03:19.610 --> 00:03:25.330
We haven't gone over custom fields very much but if you remember in a previous chapter in the author

29
00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:32.570
pro theme there were some custom fields that the user could use to define different types of information

30
00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:41.330
In this case we've got custom fields for the type of camera the type of lens and the date the photograph

31
00:03:43.070 --> 00:03:50.300
So that was just a small tour of how I've set up custom post types within the cafe pro theme using custom

32
00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.170
Now let's go back and start setting it up ourselves in the student's sandbox.

33
00:03:57.020 --> 00:03:59.320
Go ahead and log into the student's sandbox.

34
00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:05.360
Make sure you're in the cafe pro theme site that we've been working on and it'd be a good idea to open

35
00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:15.090
Inside the student's sandbox in the cafe pro theme WordPress dashboard.

36
00:04:19.210 --> 00:04:26.170
Scroll down just a little bit and find custom press and click activate.

37
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:32.000
Great now that that plugin is activated you'll see a toolbar item on the left hand side called Custom

38
00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.600
settings for the plug in itself.

39
00:04:40.610 --> 00:04:46.540
We won't be using it but it also enables you to import and export custom both types from site to site.

40
00:04:48.100 --> 00:04:54.250
Another thing you'll notice is an additional menu item on the left side called photographs with some

41
00:05:01.330 --> 00:05:05.430
The posts button add new categories and tags.

42
00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:09.010
If you look at photographs again we've got to add a new photograph.

43
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:18.820
We have a standard tags taxonomy and then a custom photo types taxonomy which is just like categories

44
00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:33.980
new sandbox site when you activated the custom press plug in all the data was already in the database

45
00:05:34.250 --> 00:05:43.010
from the 30 posts that I created and I connected 30 media images as well with 4 different categories

46
00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:48.160
called Photo types in the categories of still life people.

47
00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:57.780
Landscape and dogs go ahead and open up under photographs click photographs so we get a list of posts

48
00:06:00.270 --> 00:06:05.970
You'll see that there's 30 items and they're all titles and they have a little bit of information across

49
00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:14.630
Follow along as I show you how I created this post type as well as some other items.

50
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.930
If you look under can custom press content types.

51
00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:26.340
We've got a photograph post type as well as a taxonomies tab and custom fields that I'll be customizing

52
00:06:26.460 --> 00:06:27.530
for you.

53
00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.980
And I've already created it's already live inside of your sandbox site.

54
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:39.330
So if you have the custom press content type screen open follow along as I show you how I created the

55
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:55.500
editing post type screen you can see that I've used photograph up here.

56
00:06:55.540 --> 00:06:59.970
Now I'll cut to the footage where I created this post type itself.

57
00:07:00.130 --> 00:07:06.880
So let's use the word photograph right here as the post type and once you name it you can't change it

58
00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:14.750
It doesn't matter if you capitalize it or not.

59
00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:17.960
It'll change it to all lowercase.

60
00:07:23.390 --> 00:07:27.790
That's the post editors so that we can add content to this custom post type.

61
00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:34.860
We're going to be using the featured image so we'll click thumbnail and we'll also allow an excerpt

62
00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.910
for a new post and then we can scroll down and leave the rest unchecked.

63
00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:50.100
But we're going to be assigning a custom category to this as a separate taxonomy so we'll leave categories

64
00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:57.640
unchecked as we go down leave the default settings for capability type and leave make sure that map

65
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:05.930
medicate abilities is checked as true and as we go down we're going to be choosing how WordPress displays

66
00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:19.150
So we have photographs usually plural for the name the singular name is going to be photograph and new

67
00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:24.440
and add new item should be add new photograph.

68
00:08:24.770 --> 00:08:28.970
And I'm just going to keep going down and I've done this before you can see that it's filling in the

69
00:08:30.630 --> 00:08:35.750
There's a little bit of text gives you some a suggestion about what the default is.

70
00:08:35.870 --> 00:08:44.060
And so you can define it for your own post type name so it will be new photograph here view photograph

71
00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:49.820
if we want to search photographs you can see that it's usually plural

72
00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:57.540
no photographs found no photographs found in trash.

73
00:08:57.890 --> 00:09:04.610
This one we can see that it's not used on nonhierarchical types which is what this is but you can put

74
00:09:15.030 --> 00:09:16.980
as we go down the left hand column.

75
00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.150
hand side.

76
00:09:25.230 --> 00:09:26.850
I'm just going to place it here below.

77
00:09:33.750 --> 00:09:35.940
the default icon for posts right here.

78
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:44.740
It'll be public so we leave that as true.

79
00:09:44.940 --> 00:09:49.990
These aren't changeable right now since it's public will go down to the next election.

80
00:09:50.010 --> 00:09:56.910
This isn't going to be a hierarchical post type but when we do go up and choose a taxonomy for it we're

81
00:10:03.810 --> 00:10:06.450
for these photographs if we need to.

82
00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:08.820
So I'll leave this as false.

83
00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.730
It has an archive.

84
00:10:10.920 --> 00:10:11.880
True.

85
00:10:12.150 --> 00:10:23.070
And I'd like it to be called photographs also I'll have to rewrite as true and just leave this as the

86
00:10:23.190 --> 00:10:24.320
default.

87
00:10:24.870 --> 00:10:31.730
And in terms of IP mask and point mask this is more advanced but we can just leave none checked leave

88
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:34.000
True.

89
00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:36.360
And this export import.

90
00:10:37.830 --> 00:10:44.940
And then click Add post type and now by doing that I've created a post type called photograph and therefore

91
00:10:51.950 --> 00:10:55.820
Basically a category as well as a series of custom fields.

92
00:10:56.130 --> 00:11:03.380
Let's click the next tab across called taxonomies and we're going to create a taxonomy for our custom.

93
00:11:03.740 --> 00:11:10.920
So click add taxonomy and we've got again a two column lay out of a whole bunch of different settings

94
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.650
for this custom taxonomy.

95
00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:15.110
It's the same type of thing.

96
00:11:15.330 --> 00:11:22.470
So use photo underscore type and we're going to make this available for the photograph.

97
00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:40.150
usually plural so we need this one to be photo types and the singular one is called photo type and knew

98
00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:44.900
would be add new photo type and new photo type.

99
00:11:44.910 --> 00:11:53.200
This is what it will say when we want to edit the photo type update photo type search photo types.

100
00:11:53.250 --> 00:11:56.320
Usually it's a plural.

101
00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:59.470
This one will be popular photo types.

102
00:11:59.490 --> 00:12:02.330
This one is all photo types.

103
00:12:02.440 --> 00:12:11.710
This be parent photo type and with a colon this will be parent photo type with a colon add or remove.

104
00:12:11.730 --> 00:12:15.250
Now this isn't used on hierarchical taxonomies.

105
00:12:15.360 --> 00:12:18.870
We are going to define this taxonomy as a hierarchical one.

106
00:12:25.200 --> 00:12:26.030
blank.

107
00:12:26.310 --> 00:12:32.220
And I'm also leaving choose from most used blank because this is going to be a hierarchical taxonomy

108
00:12:32.430 --> 00:12:37.400
basically similar to categories almost finished.

109
00:12:37.410 --> 00:12:40.320
Now we can click true for show admen column.

110
00:12:46.980 --> 00:12:50.870
It'll show us information about each of our taxonomies if we like.

111
00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:55.160
We want to leave it public and then these are just automatically selected for us.

112
00:12:57.470 --> 00:13:04.700
We're going to make this true so that our custom taxonomy here is like categories not like tags.

113
00:13:05.010 --> 00:13:12.350
So we can leave the rest the same as the default rewrite it needs to be true EPM mass can be none.

114
00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:14.660
And then add taxonomy type

115
00:13:17.880 --> 00:13:22.670
one more setting inside of custom fields.

116
00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:28.450
We're going to add a custom field for our post type.

117
00:13:28.530 --> 00:13:36.090
Now we'll just create three different custom fields one for the type of camera and I found using this

118
00:13:36.810 --> 00:13:42.680
It's nice to have a colon at the end of the title because the display is a little bit easier.

119
00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:50.340
So if we look over at my example here remember in our single post if we scroll down it shows some image

120
00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:58.710
So camer a colon and then whatever the photographer filled in inside the pots and then lands and then

121
00:14:05.850 --> 00:14:10.970
So use camera Colan it doesn't necessarily have to be required.

122
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:18.610
I think I did require the type of camera but then leave the lens and the date open leave the default

123
00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:28.780
Now this one I have used a radio button with two different cameras so you can put anything you want

124
00:14:37.680 --> 00:14:43.300
So two types of cameras one or the other makes it easy for the user to choose from the two.

125
00:14:43.740 --> 00:14:49.820
And we're going to be using this custom field in one of our post types and it's the photograph posts

126
00:14:59.380 --> 00:15:02.590
So now we'll do lens.

127
00:15:02.930 --> 00:15:09.500
Colin you don't can make that non required because obviously if you're going to use the iPhone you might

128
00:15:13.580 --> 00:15:21.110
We can leave it as a text box or they can fill in whatever lens and we need to then add it to this post

129
00:15:21.650 --> 00:15:22.860
And that's our last step

130
00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.220
last one.

131
00:15:30.910 --> 00:15:37.630
Just in case the person is adding a bunch of photographs into their web site and it's all on a certain

132
00:15:45.190 --> 00:15:47.910
so that the photograph was taken on a certain date.

133
00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:50.960
And in this way we can use any of these elections.

134
00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.270
And let's experiment with the date picker.

135
00:15:54.370 --> 00:15:55.740
And so this is good.

136
00:16:01.630 --> 00:16:04.650
For us it's usually like this in the USA.

137
00:16:04.990 --> 00:16:12.150
So I select that one and go down and select for this custom post type again and click add custom field

138
00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:14.160
in this video.

139
00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:19.290
You've followed along with the set up steps for creating a certain custom post type called photographs

140
00:16:19.590 --> 00:16:25.800
using the custom press plugin since you activated the plug in however I've populated your Sandbach site

141
00:16:31.410 --> 00:16:32.570
your content.

142
00:16:32.610 --> 00:16:37.270
That way you won't have to create each of the posts yourself in the next video.

143
00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:42.450
You'll start by creating a few new posts for your custom post type then you'll customize the display

144
00:16:45.510 --> 00:16:46.160
Let's do it.
