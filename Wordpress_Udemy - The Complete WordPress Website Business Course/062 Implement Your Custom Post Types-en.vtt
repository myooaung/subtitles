00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:05.340
In this lesson you'll import or create 30 posts in our custom post-time.

2
00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:11.340
You'll organize lots of posts images categories and tags and make sure they display well within the

3
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:17.580
By the end you'll have the skills to set up custom post types for any website project no matter what

4
00:00:19.620 --> 00:00:27.800
Let's go let's go and just take one more look at my sample site which is showing a single photograph

5
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:34.020
So this one is Jake the dog.

6
00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:41.330
It's got a little bit of copy and a full size photo inside of the single post and then below it's got

7
00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.700
where the category which is our custom taxonomy called dogs.

8
00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:53.190
And then whatever words that it's been tagged with back in the student's sandbox in the Wordpress dashboard

9
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.410
press and we set up a content type called photographs and a custom taxonomy as well as some custom fields

10
00:01:10.490 --> 00:01:17.390
let's create four posts in our photographs custom post type and let's create one post for each of the

11
00:01:20.990 --> 00:01:26.540
So under photographs click Add new and you can see over on the right.

12
00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.760
We've already got four photo types that are available.

13
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:36.210
Let's start with dogs and just choose any name for your dog.

14
00:01:39.400 --> 00:01:46.490
And now since these posts are already inside our photographs custom post hope and we've created those

15
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:50.090
post types taxonomies and custom fields.

16
00:01:56.030 --> 00:02:04.320
as well as below the content editing area a photograph information section which is our custom fields.

17
00:02:04.390 --> 00:02:06.340
Here's a small challenge for you.

18
00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.460
Choose a camera.

19
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.580
Fill in a type of lens and choose a date using the date picker and over on the right hand side.

20
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:30.580
Choose two or three tags if you click the button choose from the most use tags you'll see the tags that

21
00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:43.750
Choose one of the photo types for each of the four posts and then use the same image for the featured

22
00:02:45.010 --> 00:02:48.240
You'll see that there's 30 images here.

23
00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:57.320
Some are landscapes some are dogs some are people and others are still life so you can choose a dog's

24
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:13.360
And lastly inside the body text area click Add media choose the same image that you did for the featured

25
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:25.080
Use no you are l and let's make it the large size and click insert into post and now the cursor is right

26
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:43.320
You might go to Lipscombe dot org as I've instructed you before and grab maybe one sentence really of

27
00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:57.940
So I'll just grab one sentence here and click copy that will be a little bit of content below each of

28
00:03:59.530 --> 00:04:02.410
And now we've got all the information that we need.

29
00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:15.080
And you can click publish so pas the video now create all four posts one for each photo type and populate

30
00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:23.100
I didn't choose the tags for this one.

31
00:04:23.120 --> 00:04:32.080
I think this is it's a dog I would call this summer.

32
00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:34.020
Is that a dog sweater.

33
00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:35.820
Sure.

34
00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.270
That sounds fine and a quick update.

35
00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.570
How did that go for you.

36
00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:47.520
It should have been relatively straightforward.

37
00:04:47.860 --> 00:04:52.360
If you open one of your four posts you created and open the permalink.

38
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.760
And as I open up that page you can see that I've got the title of full with image.

39
00:05:06.100 --> 00:05:08.150
Some copy that I placed below.

40
00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:10.510
Here's where we have the Filed under.

41
00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:22.260
Let's take a look at the L slash photographs.

42
00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:35.330
image and their text and filed under still live.

43
00:05:35.340 --> 00:05:37.150
And here are the tags.

44
00:05:37.200 --> 00:05:37.720
Great.

45
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:45.390
And as I go down I'm showing four items on a page and then I've got a pagination here via number and

46
00:05:47.010 --> 00:05:53.340
One thing I'm seeing that I want to change is that I'm showing this full with image and the text below.

47
00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:59.730
And I'm just going to make a quick Genesis change and you can follow along and do this on your own sandbox

48
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:03.220
site under Genesis and theme settings.

49
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.810
archives when I list different posts in a list instead of showing the entry content.

50
00:06:14.820 --> 00:06:24.010
I'd like to show an excerpt as well as the featured image and I think 300 for my medium is probably

51
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:27.810
Image alignment left.

52
00:06:27.910 --> 00:06:28.310
Great.

53
00:06:28.330 --> 00:06:32.210
And let's go down and click save changes.

54
00:06:32.290 --> 00:06:40.040
Now let's look at that photograph page again by refreshing and yeah I like it except I'd like this image

55
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.980
to 600 pixel thumbnails.

56
00:06:50.540 --> 00:06:52.210
Here's a nice challenge for you.

57
00:06:52.280 --> 00:07:01.520
Go back into settings and media settings and change your medium thumbnail size to 600 by 600 and then

58
00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:09.140
now and give it a go.

59
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:11.530
How they go for you.

60
00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:19.930
Well I mean settings media and I just need to change my Macs with to 600 by 600

61
00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.550
and then I'll click save changes.

62
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:33.430
And the last step as I suggested use the regenerate thumbnails plug in and just regenerate all the thumbnails

63
00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:38.300
that will create those 600 pixel wide images from the originals.

64
00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:44.230
So we maintain quality instead of enlarging the 300 pixel size.

65
00:07:44.290 --> 00:07:47.830
Great now that that's 100 percent finished it's open.

66
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:53.940
The photographs archive again and take a look at our 600 pixel white images.

67
00:07:55.040 --> 00:08:02.030
Nice So we're listing for posts and then we can click next page and we've got four more.

68
00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:02.990
Great.

69
00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:10.450
Now if we look at one of our photo type categories one called Still Life.

70
00:08:10.460 --> 00:08:15.500
I've got all the still lives in one list again for at a time.

71
00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:16.420
That's great.

72
00:08:16.460 --> 00:08:19.540
And what happens if I go to one of my tags.

73
00:08:19.610 --> 00:08:21.830
I'm going to click antique.

74
00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:28.760
Now if you get this problem we may have to change the settings under the custom press plugin for how

75
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:39.480
You can see that I'm trying to view the tag page for the tag antique and no posts are matching my criteria.

76
00:08:39.740 --> 00:08:45.740
Well go back into the Wordpress dashboard and you can see I do have all these tags and the antique tag

77
00:08:50.270 --> 00:08:53.360
Well under custom press and settings.

78
00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.510
tags or categories.

79
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:09.770
Instead of checking default to uncheck default and we want to check photograph and that way when we

80
00:09:16.310 --> 00:09:17.560
like to select here.

81
00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:25.410
So if I click save changes now when I go back to the antique tag page if I refresh the page I should

82
00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:30.900
Great.

83
00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:35.910
And on the next page I think this should just be one more awesome.

84
00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:42.720
Now when we're looking at any archive page if we click the image or the title it'll bring us to a full

85
00:09:51.810 --> 00:09:58.080
which is our photo type or category as well as the tags that we're using for each image.

86
00:09:59.770 --> 00:10:06.910
In this lesson you imported or created 30 posts in our new photographs custom post type and make sure

87
00:10:06.940 --> 00:10:10.080
they contain all our custom data and images.

88
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:17.110
Then you arranged the post type display in the cafe pro theme to look good inside archive pages.

89
00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:28.720
in each photograph post and we'll arrange some of our new custom post type content on the scrolling

90
00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:30.270
See there
