00:00:00.740 --> 00:00:05.980
In this lesson you'll embark on some challenges to customize the executive pro theme in ways you've

2
00:00:11.710 --> 00:00:17.050
Create and upload a small Hetter logo and customize the bottom footer as well.

3
00:00:21.760 --> 00:00:24.390
your skills to use in the student sandbox.

4
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:33.160
First make sure you have the executive pro theme site open and have the actual site open in one tab

5
00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:36.160
and the dashboard open in another.

6
00:00:36.430 --> 00:00:43.060
I called mine executive Pro and it's the second site that we've been working on for this one let's go

7
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:53.590
This is the default menu that I created as a demo as a part of that Parallax theme with one drop down

8
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.700
and each menu item is actually just a placeholder with the hash tag as the you.

9
00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:07.000
What I'd like you to do now is create a menu across the top with some appropriate links probably to

10
00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:16.160
And let's create a contact us page and put that page link up at the top right as well.

11
00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.940
So a few pages a Contact Us page.

12
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.860
And how about a button that links back to the home page.

13
00:01:22.870 --> 00:01:26.840
Good luck Well I hope that went well for you.

14
00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:33.380
As you remember there's two places where you can go within the Wordpress dashboard to edit menus and

15
00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:41.550
a live preview.

16
00:01:41.570 --> 00:01:51.590
I'm going to go into appearance menus this time and I know that we're using one called Hetter menu right

17
00:01:52.490 --> 00:02:00.860
And just like the parallax theme the location of that Hetter menu is in a custom menu item in the header

18
00:02:02.810 --> 00:02:08.840
Let's just take a look at that for now and come back to the menus area.

19
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:14.870
If we look under Hetter right we can see there's a custom menu widget that has been pulled across from

20
00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.270
So I'll go back into appearance menus.

21
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:32.850
And I'm going to create a new one for pressing this button right here create a new menu.

22
00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.780
I'm going to name it.

23
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.660
So I know what it is.

24
00:02:40.670 --> 00:02:43.820
It create menu and then you'll be able to pull items into it.

25
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:52.260
Well I first knew that I wanted to go ahead and put in our if you view all the pages I want to put in

26
00:02:53.910 --> 00:03:03.840
Now when you just hit home and click Add the menu and put it in there I'm going to put a few pages from

27
00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:06.440
the theme that are in here.

28
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.580
Let's see the telecommunications page

29
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.050
development and design so that all of three of those pages to the menu.

30
00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:29.060
And now I notice that there already exists a contact page that we had imported using the executive pro

31
00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:32.020
sample content XML file.

32
00:03:32.280 --> 00:03:35.330
So I'll bring in that contact page that already exists.

33
00:03:35.430 --> 00:03:39.620
Knowing that I need to go in there and edit it how I like it.

34
00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:46.070
Now if I click save menu that 5 items in my menu I've saved that menu.

35
00:03:53.180 --> 00:03:58.150
just made executive Hederman new I had to save that.

36
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.910
So I should be able to go right to my site and in the Other tab and hit refresh.

37
00:04:03.200 --> 00:04:04.170
And there we go.

38
00:04:05.180 --> 00:04:12.620
The page this year on shows the accent color button as our full height and then if I click design for

39
00:04:17.210 --> 00:04:20.330
Let's look at this contact page.

40
00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:27.270
All right so the the folks at Studio press recommend using a plugin called gravity forms which is excellent

41
00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:39.000
page that we brought in with the sample content import is not working because we don't have the gravity

42
00:04:39.040 --> 00:04:41.800
form plug in enabled.

43
00:04:41.870 --> 00:04:42.750
Here's a link to it.

44
00:04:42.860 --> 00:04:45.760
So I know I'm going to have to go in and edit that contact page.

45
00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:51.380
Make sure our home page works.

46
00:04:51.490 --> 00:04:53.740
Don't worry about the contact page for now.

47
00:04:58.420 --> 00:05:06.280
Can you remember an parallax pro theme how we changed it from just the text appear to having a logo

48
00:05:07.510 --> 00:05:08.920
That's your next challenge.

49
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:25.050
And go into your image editing program and create a an image and save it as a ping file and upload it

50
00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.490
and convert this text logo to a graphic logo.

51
00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.690
Good luck.

52
00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:34.890
Now this time it will go into the customized.

53
00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:39.820
And look at all of my theme options for using that hetter logo.

54
00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:53.410
In fact in our brochure site and our other site that we made in our local development environment we

55
00:05:58.060 --> 00:06:06.040
The executive theme and many Genesis themes use a custom area here under Hetter image to put a logo.

56
00:06:06.340 --> 00:06:11.140
And so you could see it tells me to 60 by 100 is the size I want my image.

57
00:06:11.290 --> 00:06:18.010
So I'll open Photoshop and go ahead and create a 260 by 100 pixel image.

58
00:06:26.200 --> 00:06:27.700
it as a Photoshop document.

59
00:06:27.790 --> 00:06:35.830
But then I also went saved it for web and devices in Photoshop a transparent background is noted by

60
00:06:41.890 --> 00:06:46.910
I left it as a transparency background and PNB or ping files.

61
00:06:47.090 --> 00:06:53.410
And Jeff says well can maintain a transparent background so I left the transparency box checked and

62
00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:00.710
It was only about 3.6 kilobytes by using a transparent background.

63
00:07:00.820 --> 00:07:07.060
If I change the color from white slightly in the header or the background of this logo I can still use

64
00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:16.440
I've already saved that inside a folder on my desktop called Executive Pro.

65
00:07:16.550 --> 00:07:24.450
And so now I can go back to my website that I'm customizing here click add new image upload files and

66
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:38.400
file select and crap since I did it to the exact size.

67
00:07:38.440 --> 00:07:44.870
I'm just going to skip crapping and use that logo right up there at the top.

68
00:07:44.880 --> 00:07:45.200
Nice.

69
00:07:45.210 --> 00:07:47.190
And it's clickable to the home page.

70
00:07:47.220 --> 00:07:48.500
I'll hit save and publish.

71
00:07:48.540 --> 00:07:50.420
And let's go on to our next challenge.

72
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:55.100
Let's finish up with the bottom footer of the site.

73
00:07:55.520 --> 00:08:00.330
As you know we customized the footer widgets one two and three.

74
00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:07.640
This is the footer that appears on every page but this is the default footer area that comes with Genesis

75
00:08:07.670 --> 00:08:09.590
and studio press themes.

76
00:08:09.770 --> 00:08:16.470
And I'd like you to go in and get rid of the links to executive and to Genesis and to WordPress.

77
00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:22.490
You can leave a log in and log out button but place the name of the business here after the copyright

78
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:24.050
and the little dot.

79
00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:38.120
You could put something like site by Colin and your name or your business name and then make that a

80
00:08:40.310 --> 00:08:48.310
And if you don't have a domain already just use a hash tag to make that link active but not going anywhere.

81
00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:53.720
So there's a challenge for you and pause the video now give it a try and then I'll show you how I did

82
00:08:53.810 --> 00:09:01.780
When you come back have to go with the site fliter that went well for you I'll go back over into the

83
00:09:02.620 --> 00:09:07.880
Wordpress dashboard and exit out of the Customize are there.

84
00:09:08.470 --> 00:09:13.480
And the one thing I want to make sure is that I have the appropriate plug in activated if I roll over

85
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:21.630
the Genesis.

86
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.570
Simple edits plug in.

87
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:30.190
That's what we used inside the parallax pro-team to make the edit to the bottom footer there so I'll

88
00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:43.150
And then once once that's activated that gives me a simple edits button under Gen..

89
00:09:43.300 --> 00:09:47.050
So the footer credits text is what I'm editing here.

90
00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:51.270
And I go over to the side here I know I'm going to leave the footer log in and log out.

91
00:09:51.550 --> 00:09:55.380
I leave that little dot there but I want to take out the Wordpress link.

92
00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:02.060
The Genesis studio press link and the footer child the link.

93
00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:08.910
I'm going to leave the copyright and the little dot.

94
00:10:09.100 --> 00:10:12.250
So if I just hit backspace there I could put

95
00:10:14.950 --> 00:10:16.810
the name of the CIA.

96
00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:22.040
Let's just call it executive pro and then there's going to be another die.

97
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:34.810
You know what I'll do is select the space dot space Control-C to copy that way I can hit Control V and

98
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:36.400
right in the middle there.

99
00:10:36.490 --> 00:10:48.910
I can put a space and then I could type all about that site by Colin Greg Davis if Greg Davis is what

100
00:10:53.290 --> 00:10:56.600
It's already used the less than symbol a.

101
00:10:56.740 --> 00:11:00.010
And then ATF equals quote.

102
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:03.890
And my my you are ELF for now can just be a hashtag.

103
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:10.030
End quote and then close the tag with the greater greater than symbol and then the other side of my

104
00:11:11.110 --> 00:11:15.280
Just close the anchor tag by hitting less than slash.

105
00:11:15.310 --> 00:11:20.550
A greater than and I click save settings.

106
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.930
Great now that that's saved I'll just open up my site and the other tab

107
00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:30.140
refresh the page site.

108
00:11:30.150 --> 00:11:32.310
By Greg Davis looks like it's clickable.

109
00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:44.270
But that's a whole that's a placeholder for a link and it can tell it's a link by the way that it underlines

110
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:47.080
nice in this lesson.

111
00:11:47.090 --> 00:11:54.020
You created a new navigation menu a header logo for the site and edited the bottom footer adding a link

112
00:11:56.150 --> 00:11:59.150
Nice job on the challenges in the next video.

113
00:11:59.210 --> 00:12:05.270
Will check out the custom post type called portfolio that comes with the executive pro theme and a custom

114
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:07.270
Like a category.

115
00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:09.040
That's part of it as well.

116
00:12:09.050 --> 00:12:14.080
You'll also get a feel for how you can create your own custom post types and taxonomies using a plugin
