1
00:00:00,670 --> 00:00:06,140
In this video we'll finish up the photography site by populating the last two footer widgets.

2
00:00:06,490 --> 00:00:10,360
We'll also explore post formats in the 2014 theme.

3
00:00:15,760 --> 00:00:20,770
process so we can deliver a clean website to the client by the end of this video.

4
00:00:25,780 --> 00:00:28,150
customizing with it later in the course.

5
00:00:29,270 --> 00:00:37,690
Post formats are another standardized way in wordpress that you can place posts into certain types.

6
00:00:44,150 --> 00:00:50,540
list of formats that are available to all themes that support the feature.

7
00:00:58,940 --> 00:01:06,110
the format of image and the only change that does is it displays the post in almost exactly the same

8
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:20,600
Post archive if you looked at the bottom left there it's the URL slash type slash image a theme can

9
00:01:26,480 --> 00:01:28,820
post type the person has defined.

10
00:01:29,060 --> 00:01:34,430
If you look in the Wordpress dashboard I've got this hello world post open and over on the right hand

11
00:01:41,330 --> 00:01:45,110
doesn't use the post format types.

12
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:59,810
actually nine different kinds of formats and theme developers and developers on WordPress can't change

13
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,150
As I said there are standardized lists that are available to all themes.

14
00:02:06,350 --> 00:02:13,830
If I click image under hello world you can see that that's going to show me a list of posts that are

15
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:34,790
or a list of tags on a tag archive page the other thing that 2014 offers is a widget that you can use

16
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:46,750
And it's called the 2014 ephemera widget just to take a look at it.

17
00:02:50,990 --> 00:02:56,270
It would be a listing of a certain post format.

18
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:06,260
However many posts you want to show and then you could say I might call this one images and it should

19
00:03:14,540 --> 00:03:16,530
images.

20
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:25,950
So if I just refresh the page any page again I'm on the image type page but if I go down and look looks

21
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,140
name and the date the author and how many comments.

22
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:46,730
And then it actually shows the the actual image and then a more button which would show this image is

23
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:48,710
post format archive.

24
00:03:50,210 --> 00:03:54,270
Now you can see that the hello world post is not showing an image.

25
00:03:54,500 --> 00:03:58,000
And this post format image has this one.

26
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:06,140
And the post format image with a caption is showing this one we can fix that by going in and opening

27
00:04:16,100 --> 00:04:20,060
And then we can just take a look at what that looks like.

28
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:27,790
and I'll add the same image.

29
00:04:31,160 --> 00:04:41,680
As the one that I was using Let's see how should I display it or display it with a large size and no

30
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:48,740
great if I update that post.

31
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:54,680
And then I can go back and refresh the page I might go and just look at the home page

32
00:04:58,210 --> 00:04:59,450
let's take a look.

33
00:04:59,730 --> 00:05:04,190
Great at showing the image and then the titles clickable through to the post.

34
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,180
And these images are also right here.

35
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:16,640
Another way that these put post formats and enable you to organize your posts a little bit is in the

36
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:30,650
it shows you a little image link right here and if you look at the bottom left hand side of the screen

37
00:05:37,640 --> 00:05:43,760
So if I click that inside of the post list inside the Wordpress dashboard I'm going to get a list of

38
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:51,930
all the posts that are inside that image post format for now I'm just going to go ahead and revert back

39
00:05:51,960 --> 00:05:56,620
and not use the post formats for now on our 2014 site.

40
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:02,100
But I wanted to make sure that you saw what that was inside the editing window and the types of things

41
00:06:05,470 --> 00:06:10,810
One more thing I'm going to go back to a perience widgets and just get rid of that widget in the content

42
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:22,880
Great that should revert my site back to the way that it was.

43
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:26,480
And let's do a couple of more things to finish up.

44
00:06:26,500 --> 00:06:29,080
We'll check that everything is working right.

45
00:06:29,090 --> 00:06:38,020
Will fill these two footer widget areas with some more appropriate content and call it good.

46
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:42,250
There's two slight issues I've noticed as I've been working on the site.

47
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:51,600
One is that I do have this search bar in side of the primary sidebar but I also have this search area

48
00:06:55,050 --> 00:07:01,020
It's a nice looking magnifying glass search icon with a green bar that opens this nice search window.

49
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:11,640
I've noticed that sometimes when I click this home button it's actually taking me instead of taking

50
00:07:15,090 --> 00:07:20,670
Now this used to be the home page when we were creating our brochure site and we made the navigation

51
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:29,890
time which was the sample page.

52
00:07:29,910 --> 00:07:36,710
Now the logo or the title of the site name over here always points to the home you are l.

53
00:07:36,810 --> 00:07:43,360
But over here I've got the wrong menu navigation and so let's make those two changes right now.

54
00:07:43,470 --> 00:07:44,890
Go ahead and stop the video.

55
00:07:44,910 --> 00:07:47,890
Get those changes done if you haven't already and then come on back.

56
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:53,150
We'll have that work.

57
00:07:59,960 --> 00:08:09,740
Secondly I'm going to go into menus under appearance and I want to go to manage locations just to find

58
00:08:10,760 --> 00:08:12,140
my Hederman you here.

59
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:16,440
And then I can get at it.

60
00:08:16,590 --> 00:08:23,750
I also could have gotten there by opening this one and clicking the header menu but instead of.

61
00:08:23,900 --> 00:08:26,770
Now this is a page called home.

62
00:08:34,820 --> 00:08:35,730
area.

63
00:08:35,810 --> 00:08:45,690
So I'm actually going to make a custom link I can go back here to get the URL just Control-C copy.

64
00:08:53,540 --> 00:09:03,220
Now I don't want at the very end so I'm going to drag it up to that original spot and click save menu.

65
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,280
Let's take a look.

66
00:09:08,230 --> 00:09:09,850
Here's the home page of the site.

67
00:09:09,910 --> 00:09:17,020
If I roll over home it's taking me the home page it also shows that it's green instead of white showing

68
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,600
Also I've gotten rid of that search bar here because it was a duplicate search bar that was available

69
00:09:24,610 --> 00:09:27,000
up here.

70
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:32,380
Now there's a lot of different things that you could do with the two remaining footer widgets.

71
00:09:32,790 --> 00:09:39,860
Let's go ahead and go over to the customize or and let's see what appropriate content we could put in

72
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:47,540
We already have a map with our location and the name address and potentially you could put the phone

73
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:53,570
It's there already.

74
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,350
But we just have to text widgets over here for now let's see what else we can use.

75
00:10:04,860 --> 00:10:12,440
We're going to go ahead and remove one of the text widgets and let's just click Add a widget.

76
00:10:18,110 --> 00:10:20,700
maybe they've gone to the bottom of a long post.

77
00:10:26,990 --> 00:10:32,310
in the site from down here without having to scroll all the way back up.

78
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:39,130
Now in this theme the header navigation actually stays at the top of the page no matter where you're

79
00:10:40,690 --> 00:10:46,330
We don't want to necessarily duplicate these pages down here in the footer but one of the things we

80
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,480
a different category page there.

81
00:10:54,910 --> 00:11:02,390
So it's like add a widget and I'll just click a category's widget as it is.

82
00:11:04,010 --> 00:11:07,390
Each one of those clickable.

83
00:11:07,670 --> 00:11:14,090
And if I remove all the posts from the Uncategorized category then that one won't appear there and we

84
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:27,510
So what are we going to replace this text widget with.

85
00:11:27,550 --> 00:11:30,310
I was going to go through and remove it.

86
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,320
And let's see what else we can choose

87
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:42,840
the pages we already have appear in the regular navigation so I don't want to replace that.

88
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:49,530
But for now I think it's a good idea to place a little detail from the about page just down here at

89
00:11:51,570 --> 00:11:59,100
So I think I will use a text widget here and if we just have an About Me section over here on the right

90
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:07,260
go ahead and get some of the content.

91
00:12:13,770 --> 00:12:21,350
maybe just the first say two sentences something that's appropriate for someone to see at the footer

92
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:24,720
of the Web site that's going to be on every page of the Web site.

93
00:12:25,170 --> 00:12:38,040
Maybe I'll do a sentence and then there's a hit enter and then enter here too and automatically add

94
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,670
Nice maybe I want to put another space in there.

95
00:12:47,290 --> 00:12:51,740
I can lay it out how I like.

96
00:12:51,890 --> 00:12:52,810
That looks great.

97
00:12:54,030 --> 00:12:55,580
One last thing though.

98
00:12:55,770 --> 00:12:56,420
Let's just.

99
00:12:56,440 --> 00:12:58,740
Well I have to hit save and publish Of course.

100
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:06,330
But let's talk about within the site you know that we imported that SML file which gave us a lot to

101
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:14,760
It gave us a bunch of menus give us posts a lot of media in the library that we've been using to arrange

102
00:13:17,520 --> 00:13:19,500
There were comments in there.

103
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:30,330
There were categories and tags that we've used and I don't often bring in a whole slew of sample content

104
00:13:30,420 --> 00:13:36,360
in that way unless it's the first time that I've worked with a certain theme for many client sites.

105
00:13:36,450 --> 00:13:41,150
All I need to do is make a couple of sample posts sample pages.

106
00:13:41,250 --> 00:13:46,420
Bring in a few pieces of media and I've got what I need to make the site look great.

107
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:52,410
So when you're done doing the site build How do you get rid of all that content.

108
00:13:57,150 --> 00:14:02,910
One of the things that you might consider doing is just going inside of Wordpress and going to each

109
00:14:09,870 --> 00:14:19,660
they're using the bulk actions dropdown here's a challenge for you go in and delete all the extra posts

110
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:30,660
And then under Post's tags let's get rid of all the tags except for the one called featured that we

111
00:14:36,150 --> 00:14:40,620
And just go in and remove the tag cloud widget from the content sidebar.

112
00:14:42,150 --> 00:14:47,870
Pause the video now and get rid of all that extraneous content and then come back and watch me do it.

113
00:14:48,860 --> 00:14:53,860
How to go I hope you were able to get rid of a bunch of extra stuff that you didn't need.

114
00:14:54,810 --> 00:14:59,850
One of the things that we did in a previous video that I hope you're able to do is instead of going

115
00:15:07,500 --> 00:15:12,790
seeing them all on a single page.

116
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:19,580
So in terms of pages there's only six pages that I want to save here and I want to get rid of all of

117
00:15:23,540 --> 00:15:24,470
I don't need them now.

118
00:15:28,960 --> 00:15:35,350
So what I'll do is check all of them and now I don't want to delete all of them so I'm going to uncheck

119
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:47,100
And then in book actions I could say move to trash apply.

120
00:15:47,320 --> 00:15:53,440
I've sped up the video here while I delete all the posts and then all the remaining tags except for

121
00:15:57,520 --> 00:16:03,040
When I deliver a site to a client I normally delete all the posts and pages that I used in design out

122
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:11,310
One more thing to clean up the site.

123
00:16:11,430 --> 00:16:19,670
I've got to get rid of that tag cloud widget that we had in the sidebar because I've got no tags.

124
00:16:22,760 --> 00:16:23,030
Great.

125
00:16:24,930 --> 00:16:26,700
I have a lot less posts.

126
00:16:26,760 --> 00:16:29,470
I still have post one two and three.

127
00:16:29,670 --> 00:16:38,420
I still have the three posts for the home page that I saved the tag clouds gone gray and my footer content

128
00:16:38,450 --> 00:16:39,110
as well.

129
00:16:42,020 --> 00:16:43,860
Nice job in this video.

130
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:50,060
You finished up your client site by cleaning up the extra Post's pages and tags and using two more widgets

131
00:16:51,590 --> 00:16:56,130
You also learn how post formats can be used as long as the theme supports them.

132
00:16:56,600 --> 00:17:01,320
Congratulations you made it to the end of chapter 4 in the next section.

133
00:17:01,400 --> 00:17:04,230
We'll do some technical work with the site we just created.

134
00:17:04,310 --> 00:17:07,190
Migrating it from one server to another.

135
00:17:12,740 --> 00:17:16,570
for staging a site to make changes without affecting the live site.

136
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:17,540
Let's go
