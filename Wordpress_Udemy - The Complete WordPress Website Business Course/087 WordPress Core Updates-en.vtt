00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:05.760
In this video you'll learn about WordPress updates to the core files and why it's important to keep

2
00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:14.870
There are two levels of Wordpress core updates major feature releases and minor and security updates.

3
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.240
Both types of updates can be made to be completely automated or initiated by the administrator and they

4
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.590
By the end of this lesson you'll have an understanding of how each type of update is referenced and

5
00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:36.510
functionality.

6
00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:43.030
Let's start by just taking a look at what the Wordpress Codex says about updating WordPress.

7
00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:48.270
I'm at Wordpress dot org and I just did a search up here at the right for updating WordPress.

8
00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:54.460
There's a page called updating Wordpress and it has a little bit of detail that you can read about even

9
00:01:00.190 --> 00:01:07.180
The main paragraph that we'll look at right here is the fact that automatic background updates are now

10
00:01:07.450 --> 00:01:09.600
in wordpress built in.

11
00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:16.660
Starting at versioned 3.7 you don't have to apply minor and security updates and they are set to actually

12
00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:19.930
automatically apply in the background.

13
00:01:20.730 --> 00:01:24.870
It's definitely a best practice to leave this set as is.

14
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:36.870
Now these are referred to with a third decimal place within the version numbers.

15
00:01:36.930 --> 00:01:45.270
So we have 3.7 comes out at a certain time 3.7 point one will be a security update that can be automatically

16
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:50.280
activated just in the background as soon as Wordpress issues it.

17
00:01:55.860 --> 00:02:02.660
they want to patch that immediately so that the risk of your site being hacked or compromised is minimized.

18
00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:12.290
The next kind of update is called a major feature release and that would be to a new feature version

19
00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.350
inside of the version that's currently active.

20
00:02:18.320 --> 00:02:26.490
We just upgraded from version four point five point three to four point six.

21
00:02:27.050 --> 00:02:30.410
And now 4.6 was a major feature release.

22
00:02:30.530 --> 00:02:39.180
It was put out to add a lot of different features to WordPress and it's not necessarily a security update.

23
00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:47.990
So these major feature releases do not automatically update but you can use one click instead of the

24
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:53.950
updating area inside of the Wordpress dashboard to update your version.

25
00:02:54.180 --> 00:03:00.900
On the other hand some hosting companies provide automatic updates of the major feature release versions

26
00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:12.990
In fact flywheel has an upgrade schedule that's about two to three weeks beyond when the new version

27
00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.430
They do this for a reason and that's just in case there are any errors or security issues that immediately

28
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:25.820
All the sites on flywheel are as secure as they possibly can be.

29
00:03:25.830 --> 00:03:31.970
So now in one of my sites wild food girl dotcom in my flywheel account is out of date.

30
00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:41.940
It's got the previous latest version four point 5.3 but the version 4.6 was the newest version released

31
00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.730
a couple of weeks ago.

32
00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:49.350
Now you can see down here in their message they're going to be automatically upgrading sites starting

33
00:03:53.640 --> 00:04:00.300
But if I wanted to manually upgrade to 4.6 through my flywheel dashboard I could just click this button

34
00:04:00.390 --> 00:04:04.350
right here inside the see panel site ground.

35
00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:10.540
If you scroll down towards the bottom they have their special software and services section where they

36
00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:21.130
I just clicked it and it's loading the sites that I have and enabled it this domain and I can choose

37
00:04:27.940 --> 00:04:28.740
at all.

38
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:37.100
I could disable auto update right here if I want to now you probably have an old version of a WordPress

39
00:04:43.250 --> 00:04:47.980
and see that older version and be able to make some updates.

40
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.040
I've got our fire weed photography site open inside of my local development environment.

41
00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:57.270
So I do have map running like this.

42
00:04:57.440 --> 00:05:02.500
And if I open that WordPress dashboard I can see this little nag at the top says WordPress.

43
00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.840
And there's a link there.

44
00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:13.850
Also inside of the dashboard area the at a glance which it says what version I'm running of Wordpress

45
00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:16.240
as well as what theme I'm running.

46
00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:24.210
So right now pause the video and find an older version of one of the sites that we've created together

47
00:05:27.870 --> 00:05:34.590
Whether it's in your local development environment using map or another service or whether it's on one

48
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:42.420
is.

49
00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.610
Once you have your Wordpress dashboard open there are a few places to check out to see information about

50
00:05:55.940 --> 00:06:03.500
First on the dashboard admin bar at the top there's a little recycle or circular icon at the top that

51
00:06:05.930 --> 00:06:12.120
And this links through to this Updates page right here within the Wordpress dashboard.

52
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:17.780
Also you can see under plug ins there's a little indicator that tells me I have 10 plug ins that are

53
00:06:21.560 --> 00:06:27.950
For now let's take a look at the updates page in the Wordpress dashboard and that'll give you a message

54
00:06:35.420 --> 00:06:42.860
Now I could just click Update now right now and update that WordPress version internally within my local

55
00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.110
But the first thing you want to do and this is important.

56
00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:50.240
You want to back up your database and files.

57
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:58.250
It's always a recommended best practice before updating any WordPress versions plugins or themes that

58
00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:08.180
were to go wrong you could revert back to your backup files.

59
00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:21.020
corps in quite a long time a number of years but it's always a best practice to keep a current backup

60
00:07:21.170 --> 00:07:22.380
on file.

61
00:07:22.460 --> 00:07:29.540
What I've done inside my local host and I'll ask you to do is to create a full backup that's dated today

62
00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:35.070
so that you can always restore that backup in the case that this update goes wrong.

63
00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:43.250
The way I did that was I activated the all in one W.P. migration plugin and I clicked export and I saved

64
00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.650
And here you can see the file name of my double you press backup file has the date and that's today's

65
00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:07.850
So back on the site now that I have my whole site backed up including files and the entire database

66
00:08:10.550 --> 00:08:14.730
Now go ahead and follow along and do that on your own site.

67
00:08:15.570 --> 00:08:16.250
OK great.

68
00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:29.220
There's always a welcome video and there's some notes about what's been added in these major feature

69
00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.010
updates.

70
00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:34.430
I hope that worked well for you if you are in your local environment.

71
00:08:34.500 --> 00:08:35.460
As I was.

72
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:40.690
It took a few minutes probably about three or four minutes to update to this version.

73
00:08:40.710 --> 00:08:46.890
I find that when I'm on a live server like at flywheel or at say ground the updates that I do from the

74
00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:55.920
Of course my server is connected to the Internet probably in a faster way than I am at home.

75
00:08:57.090 --> 00:09:03.840
You may get a notification that a database update is required if you get a white screen inside the Wordpress

76
00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:12.660
Now it's a good idea to do that as soon as possible and you should just hit that blue button and update

77
00:09:12.900 --> 00:09:15.450
the database right away.

78
00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:24.660
database require to keep up with security threats and future releases.

79
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.510
through the dashboard.

80
00:09:31.530 --> 00:09:36.570
If not I'm sure you'll have a chance to update WordPress soon as they usually release three to four

81
00:09:42.810 --> 00:09:47.640
These are a little bit different in that themes and plug ins are for the most part provided by third

82
00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:56.190
This means that updated versions should be tested to make sure they were correctly either before or

83
00:09:57.450 --> 00:09:58.250
Let's get to it.
