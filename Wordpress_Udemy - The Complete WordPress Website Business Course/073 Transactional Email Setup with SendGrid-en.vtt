00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.410
In this video you'll set up a transactional email sending system within your live WordPress web site

2
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:08.020
using send grid.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:13.380
There are two major advantages to using a service like send a grid instead of Google's Gmail servers

4
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:15.400
like we learned in the last video.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:21.820
For one you're able to send email from the Web site's actual domain name instead of the gmail address.

6
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:28.650
Secondly dedicated email delivery companies like send grid allow more e-mail volume and are true experts

7
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:36.090
By the end of this lesson you'll set up the most professional and secure transactional email system

8
00:00:39.420 --> 00:00:46.170
First of all let's go into our WordPress dashboard and take a look at the ad plug ins page and just

9
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.540
work inside of your Wordpress installation.

10
00:00:55.890 --> 00:01:02.400
So to set up sended the first thing you'll have to do is look at your installed plug ins list and just

11
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.900
deactivate the postman s m t p plug it in.

12
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:14.430
By clicking de-activate this will reset WordPress to be sending by the traditional method again and

13
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:22.140
when you install the send grid plug in and activate it they won't conflict with each other.

14
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:30.050
Now I should tell you that I was successfully able to use the postman S-M T.P. plug in to set up a send

15
00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:31.140
grid.

16
00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:39.370
If you notice inside of the postman plug in page if you look at the description it's designed for G-mail

17
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:42.400
and others including Sun Grid.

18
00:01:44.410 --> 00:01:52.180
I just had to put my API credentials from center grid inside of the postman plug in settings and it

19
00:01:53.650 --> 00:02:01.150
But since postman is made by a third party and if I wanted to keep using send grid into the future I

20
00:02:08.470 --> 00:02:14.830
makes an update to their API or anything like that you'll be able to have send grid's plug in update

21
00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:23.620
So if I just show you very quickly if I activate the postman S-M T.P. plug in at the same time that

22
00:02:26.020 --> 00:02:28.940
You can see that send good gives me an error message here.

23
00:02:29.110 --> 00:02:37.090
WP mail is the default mail sending system that's instead of Wordpress and it says that since WP mail

24
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.580
As empty people again you won't be able to use cent..

25
00:02:44.770 --> 00:02:50.350
Right now I already have 7 grids set up inside Gray Davis dot com and I'm going to show you how to set

26
00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.950
So for now I'll just go back down to the postman S-M T.P. settings page and I'll show you that I had

27
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:12.950
So when I clicked that I went down here and I was able to reset the plug in.

28
00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:15.730
This doesn't have any settings anymore because I've already reset it.

29
00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:21.190
But usually this button will appear red and you can just get rid of all of the S-M T.P. settings that

30
00:03:24.470 --> 00:03:29.810
So since this is having a plugin conflict and show me these this error I'm just going to go back to

31
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:46.400
MCP great now you can see that I do have this grid plug in activated and if I go to the settings page

32
00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.610
it's just a single page and it has two authentication methods.

33
00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:57.830
And I found that the API key that I got from my second grade account was easy to set up.

34
00:03:57.820 --> 00:04:02.530
I just placed that code inside of here and chose API here.

35
00:04:02.570 --> 00:04:11.840
Now one thing to note if you do use user name and password instead of API then you have to use this

36
00:04:11.990 --> 00:04:15.940
external swift plug in to send via S.M. t.p.

37
00:04:15.950 --> 00:04:21.030
So I think it's easiest to set it using the API key and it's also the most secure.

38
00:04:21.290 --> 00:04:28.280
So I can choose my e-mail that I set up send grid with to use as the sending address and then I can

39
00:04:33.350 --> 00:04:39.170
And that was it I clicked update settings and it was ready to go and I was able to go down here and

40
00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:42.990
So let's go through that process together.

41
00:04:43.920 --> 00:04:46.860
Go ahead and go to send grid dot com.

42
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:48.290
And this is their home page.

43
00:04:48.330 --> 00:04:55.140
You can see that even at cent. They do both kinds of e-mail transactional e-mail and marketing e-mail

44
00:04:55.410 --> 00:04:57.350
and they differentiate the two.

45
00:04:57.360 --> 00:05:02.820
In fact when you're using their service for transactional e-mail it's a different side of their business

46
00:05:08.010 --> 00:05:14.010
So first thing you want to do is to go and click sign up if you don't have an account already.

47
00:05:14.070 --> 00:05:20.190
Basically you enter an e-mail address and any other information they need and you click the sign up

48
00:05:23.460 --> 00:05:28.260
And then they will go ahead and confirm your e-mail address.

49
00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.120
You can use this try for free button right here.

50
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:38.490
And after you've confirmed your e-mail address you can log into send grid and then set up your free

51
00:05:43.870 --> 00:05:49.420
Now since I've already signed up for send good I'm going to go back to their home page and click the

52
00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.620
signed up for sended and it opens up my send dashboard one of the great things about using sand grid

53
00:06:04.650 --> 00:06:10.190
is it has all of these great e-mail analytics when the dashboard is set up.

54
00:06:10.260 --> 00:06:16.080
It tells you your your different e-mails that have been sent in your recent activity could see that

55
00:06:23.610 --> 00:06:28.500
Well once you're inside of your central dashboard there are some important things to set up to get your

56
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:29.210
AP.

57
00:06:29.250 --> 00:06:35.850
I key that you need to put into your wordpress site down on the left hand side if you just click Settings

58
00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:39.240
you can see that there's an API keys button.

59
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:45.180
Now I already have an API key that I set up with a name of postman API.

60
00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.610
Greg Davis.

61
00:06:46.860 --> 00:06:51.340
Now I use that same API key after getting it to work with postman.

62
00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:58.200
I turned off the postman plug in and installed the send good plug in and I was able to use that same

63
00:06:58.500 --> 00:06:59.780
API key.

64
00:06:59.790 --> 00:07:07.440
Now it's important to note that this is an API key ID and this is not my actual API key when they give

65
00:07:08.550 --> 00:07:16.200
They have a warning on the page that says that you better copy and paste and save this API key in a

66
00:07:17.610 --> 00:07:23.210
I saved it into a document on my computer and remembered where it was so that I could retrieve it later.

67
00:07:23.490 --> 00:07:30.510
If I go to the settings here I could edit the details of this API key and this is something that you'll

68
00:07:34.110 --> 00:07:41.430
What I did was I named the key and then I basically gave send grid through this key full access to all

69
00:07:49.170 --> 00:07:50.560
of the other places.

70
00:07:50.610 --> 00:07:57.510
So I'm getting myself full access through this API key for the send grid service to work through my

71
00:08:03.280 --> 00:08:05.230
my API key.

72
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:12.880
Well I do have that API key and so there is if you look in the documentation at send grid you'll see

73
00:08:17.830 --> 00:08:23.170
If you click that it just takes you to WordPress dot org where you can look at the send grid plug in

74
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:28.200
page back inside of the Wordpress dashboard.

75
00:08:28.210 --> 00:08:34.780
You know I just went to plug ins and knew I searched for censored and I was able to install this plug

76
00:08:36.370 --> 00:08:43.780
So once you've copied the API key go back into the settings send grid and this is the send grid plug

77
00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.780
Paste your entire API key into that field set.

78
00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.660
Click sendmail with API.

79
00:08:59.020 --> 00:09:04.710
you'd like to send mail and you can choose a couple of other optional fields if you like.

80
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:11.770
I choose text slash HTL which would enable me to send H.T. e-mail based e-mails if I have that enabled

81
00:09:18.610 --> 00:09:19.790
was set up.

82
00:09:19.870 --> 00:09:26.260
So once you send a test mail you could send this potentially to the same address that you used at the

83
00:09:28.570 --> 00:09:35.860
And I sent it to a different e-mail address that I have at my domain name and I just made a little test

84
00:09:40.330 --> 00:09:46.270
And now if I go back to my e-mail account you can see that I've got an e-mail open.

85
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.020
So the e-mail came through correctly it came from the address I had placed in the field inside that

86
00:09:56.860 --> 00:09:58.180
And like we did before.

87
00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.920
Now you're looking at all the headers up here.

88
00:10:04.060 --> 00:10:09.520
And if you scroll down and just look at the authentication results which is important stuff you can

89
00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:22.540
And you know if you scroll to the right just a little bit on that line there's a little bit extra.

90
00:10:22.660 --> 00:10:28.930
There is a scroll across just a little bit further and you can also see that there's a secondary type

91
00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:38.590
see that there's three kinds of e-mail authentication.

92
00:10:38.620 --> 00:10:41.980
One is SPF and that's the first and most simple.

93
00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:48.010
And the second one is called DKIM and sender it has that automatically set up through their servers

94
00:10:48.370 --> 00:10:53.490
and there is a third type of authentication that actually failed here.

95
00:10:53.560 --> 00:11:00.880
But it's no big deal because I have the first two using at least an SPF record is the best idea if you

96
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:05.130
All the better to set up D-mark.

97
00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:12.160
You have to set up another series of DNS records inside of your domain name so that recognizes that

98
00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:17.170
email sent from the Greg Davis dot com domain name is also authenticated.

99
00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:22.840
I'm not worried about that very much right now but you can see that this has been sent through the send

100
00:11:29.740 --> 00:11:33.630
S.M. T-P test that I sent through the send grid's servers.

101
00:11:33.670 --> 00:11:39.210
Earlier I mentioned that I successfully set up send a grid through the postman plug in as well.

102
00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.820
This is just what their sample e-mail looks like when you send it to yourself.

103
00:11:44.890 --> 00:11:50.000
And if I look at a view source again I have authentication results.

104
00:11:50.020 --> 00:11:57.090
SPF equals pass as well as you can see that it's coming from the send grid dot net servers.

105
00:11:57.130 --> 00:12:06.400
Several places here in the header and I also have those same results in terms of authentication.

106
00:12:06.460 --> 00:12:07.490
Let me find that again.

107
00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:10.660
There's the DKA I am signatures.

108
00:12:10.690 --> 00:12:11.080
Here we go.

109
00:12:20.950 --> 00:12:23.060
little bit further there it is.

110
00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.510
at the domain or the server level.

111
00:12:33.580 --> 00:12:34.620
And so that's OK.

112
00:12:34.870 --> 00:12:41.560
But again that was successfully set up through the post-event S M T-P plug in which is referenced right

113
00:12:48.810 --> 00:12:54.720
own life site checking your emails being sent through the send good service your rate caught up to me

114
00:12:55.230 --> 00:12:58.950
Now if you are using flywheel to set up your life sites guess what.

115
00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:08.670
Again as I indicated in a previous video flywheel uses send good to send e-mails and they're already

116
00:13:11.310 --> 00:13:17.940
So you don't need to install the plug in or any other third party service except just let WordPress

117
00:13:17.970 --> 00:13:26.140
do its job because flywheel has already upgraded your wordpress site to send through Send good.

118
00:13:26.280 --> 00:13:34.110
One last quick piece of info I looked up inside the documentation of Sen grid about the D-mark authentication

119
00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:36.330
and you can read a little bit about it here.

120
00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:53.490
SPF and DKIM which stands for domain keys identify file mail and SPF and DKIM must be implemented before

121
00:13:55.920 --> 00:14:02.910
They also have an implementing D-Mark link right here in this little description and that opens up some

122
00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:11.010
set up.

123
00:14:16.710 --> 00:14:22.860
One important thing to note is that D-Mark is a powerful way to help prevent malicious entities it says

124
00:14:22.890 --> 00:14:25.250
but D-Mark isn't for everyone.

125
00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:27.750
If you own a small domain you're probably OK without it.

126
00:14:32.730 --> 00:14:35.970
financially oriented it might be right for you.

127
00:14:45.690 --> 00:14:47.670
is even looked at.

128
00:14:48.670 --> 00:14:54.340
In this lesson you set up a more secure and robust email sending system for transactional email sent

129
00:14:56.260 --> 00:15:02.830
You can see that the additional layer of DKIM authentication is used as well as the first layer called

130
00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:05.350
SPF or sender policy framework.

131
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:10.900
Standard also gives the website the ability to send more emails per day and per month than the Google

132
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:19.210
Sparke post like standard.

133
00:15:24.820 --> 00:15:29.740
has a free level that allows for up to 100000 emails per month.
