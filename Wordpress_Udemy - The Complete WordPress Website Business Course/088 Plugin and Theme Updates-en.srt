00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,550
In this video you'll explore the different ways to update WordPress plugins and themes how you can be

2
00:00:11,150 --> 00:00:16,470
After an update because plugins and themes are the responsibility of the author and developer and are

3
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:23,700
or other errors.

4
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:27,180
Still it's best to update as soon as there's a new version available.

5
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:33,560
properly.

6
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:39,430
The first thing I'll do and suggest that you do also is go back into our WordPress dashboard at the

7
00:00:45,550 --> 00:00:46,850
on before.

8
00:00:46,870 --> 00:00:50,080
Here I am on the Welcome to WordPress 4.6 page.

9
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:55,810
After doing an update of the word press corps files from the last video I can still see that I have

10
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:58,080
14 updates available.

11
00:00:58,190 --> 00:01:04,540
If I roll over this arrow here it says 10 plugin updates for theme updates.

12
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:18,520
You should get a notification on your dashboard here and sometimes via email if you're monitoring security

13
00:01:20,890 --> 00:01:26,500
We'll talk about monitoring security for multiple Web sites for yours and client sites in a future video.

14
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,200
But for now let's talk about updating plugins and the different ways that you can do so.

15
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,760
First let's talk about updating plugins individually.

16
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:42,200
If you roll over the plugins area and just click installed plugins that will show you all your plug

17
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,060
You can see there's a yellow and orange indicator here under each of the plug ins that are due for an

18
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:58,670
update whether they're active or not on the Web site.

19
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:04,650
First thing I'll do is just go down to one of the plug ins I have that's due for an update and if you

20
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:11,940
latest version.

21
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:20,010
So this plug in version 5.4 9 for all in one WP migration has been tested up to 4.6.

22
00:02:20,130 --> 00:02:27,180
So now that I have version 4.6 installed of Wordpress I can go ahead and feel comfortable updating this

23
00:02:27,220 --> 00:02:34,290
plugin so I can update just this plugin by going over here and clicking update now you'll see that it'll

24
00:02:41,420 --> 00:02:47,870
I often like going in and updating plugins one at a time like this because I can go back and check the

25
00:02:55,490 --> 00:02:59,150
error or a conflict when I make my update.

26
00:02:59,300 --> 00:03:02,500
For now that was just a backup and migrations plug in.

27
00:03:02,570 --> 00:03:05,310
So I'm not too worried about it now.

28
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:10,910
If I update the code snippets plug in for example I just hit update now and let it update.

29
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:17,570
If I have any code active on my website I go and check the functionality of that code right away and

30
00:03:24,620 --> 00:03:28,970
Now what if I update a plug in and it breaks the website.

31
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,820
What can you do.

32
00:03:37,130 --> 00:03:39,470
And I hope you're thinking oh that's easy Greg.

33
00:03:46,130 --> 00:03:53,420
file folder thereby deactivating a plug in and getting back into the Wordpress dashboard to deal with

34
00:03:54,590 --> 00:03:55,820
And that would be correct.

35
00:04:03,650 --> 00:04:10,310
and look at my WP content folder and my plugins folder and I can look at the plug ins folders that are

36
00:04:10,550 --> 00:04:16,670
there that I can rename and deactivate manually try that on your own site.

37
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:31,280
structure either via FCP inside of the site Ground file manager via the see panel or using Windows Explorer

38
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:37,240
or the finder on a Mac I hope that went well for you.

39
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:49,030
it's an activated plug in on this Web site and since it's my local development environment is easy for

40
00:04:53,890 --> 00:04:59,470
So inside of Windows Explorer I know that in my local development environment it's under Seacole and

41
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:08,980
under the map folder and if I look under H.T. docs I have the live Desch site site which is the one

42
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:17,540
You can see in the U R L It's right there open up windows explorer one more time inside W.P. content.

43
00:05:17,730 --> 00:05:24,750
I have my plug ins folder and there's the all in one W.P. migration folder that contains the plug and

44
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,200
So I've clicked a second time to highlight the name of the plug in and I'm just going to type Dasch

45
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:35,790
rename and that'll deactivate the plug in for me.

46
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:42,060
So if I go back into the Wordpress dashboard I'm on the plugins page I can just refresh the page and

47
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:50,410
Here it is here it's showing it inside the database but it shows me an error.

48
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:52,350
It's been deactivated due to an error.

49
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,710
That just means that it's looking for it under the original name and it can't find it.

50
00:05:59,760 --> 00:06:01,490
So it's deactivated this plug in.

51
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:07,380
And if that were causing the problem if my site had gone down or something I couldn't restore my wordpress

52
00:06:12,510 --> 00:06:16,470
So I'll just quickly go back and re activate this.

53
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:26,280
automatically reactivate the plug.

54
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:31,710
You have to do that through the Wordpress dashboard so I can leave that plug in de-activated and try

55
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:39,600
If it's the one causing the problem but I know it wasn't so I can re-activated again if I want to.

56
00:06:39,630 --> 00:06:46,260
Now another way to update your plugins is to go under dashboard to the updates page and this shows you

57
00:06:53,820 --> 00:07:00,270
So I can see that I have all of these plug ins that are scheduled to be updated and if I want to I can

58
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:08,740
Update plugins.

59
00:07:08,760 --> 00:07:14,850
Now this could take a little bit of time depending on how large the plug ins are and how fast the server

60
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:27,540
As you can see I have a nice complete report after all of my plugin updates and a green line for each

61
00:07:30,150 --> 00:07:33,900
Hopefully you'll have each of them update successfully for you.

62
00:07:33,910 --> 00:07:38,190
You can see that it gives you a report at the top that it is enabling a maintenance mode and that's

63
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:45,360
progress.

64
00:07:47,100 --> 00:07:52,650
And then at the bottom it disabled maintenance mode and all updates have been completed.

65
00:07:57,090 --> 00:07:59,980
But sometimes because this takes a little while.

66
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:06,120
I'd rather do each plug in individually and periodically test the Web site to make sure that there's

67
00:08:13,230 --> 00:08:19,800
Another issue potentially is that the longer you wait over time the more plug ins need updates and the

68
00:08:27,270 --> 00:08:28,510
in that you're updating.

69
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:33,040
I like to update plug ins as often as possible and is convenient.

70
00:08:33,210 --> 00:08:40,530
And then the next video will talk about ways to monitor multiple sites from one dashboard like here.

71
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:50,590
In any case let's return to the Wordpress updates page and we can look at what's left and I can see

72
00:08:53,860 --> 00:09:01,190
It says that all plug ins are up to date and it shows that I have four themes ready for an update.

73
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:03,240
Now let's talk about themes.

74
00:09:03,260 --> 00:09:09,470
I have three default WordPress themes that came with my wordpress installation originally that are here

75
00:09:09,650 --> 00:09:11,950
and I know I'm not going to be using it all.

76
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:18,920
So instead of clogging up my web site and my file structure and database with themes that I don't need

77
00:09:19,280 --> 00:09:23,900
I'll often go ahead and delete these themes when they're ready for an update and they're giving me that

78
00:09:27,320 --> 00:09:35,030
And so what I'll do is go under appearance and themes and unfortunately it still takes a couple of clicks

79
00:09:37,580 --> 00:09:38,980
But here's how it's done.

80
00:09:38,990 --> 00:09:40,960
I'll just go here and click theme details.

81
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:46,490
And once it shows me the big detail screen I can click delete and I have to confirm that I want to delete

82
00:09:46,820 --> 00:09:49,890
that theme takes just a couple of seconds.

83
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:50,920
And there we go.

84
00:09:50,960 --> 00:09:56,570
So I go into each of these themes that is not active and that I don't need and I'll make these three

85
00:09:56,840 --> 00:10:04,270
clicks per theme just to delete them out of my system the details delete and OK

86
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:07,310
great.

87
00:10:13,790 --> 00:10:20,840
we created in one of our previous chapters and we have another child theme that we created using the

88
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:29,550
And I have the parent theme called affinity which has a new version available.

89
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:37,700
Now here's where updating our themes is important and it's just good to point out that since we're using

90
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:43,940
a child theme we don't need to update the child theme because it's not made by anyone else but ourselves

91
00:10:44,090 --> 00:10:50,660
but the parent theme can be updated and we won't overwrite any of the changes we've made in the child

92
00:10:53,960 --> 00:10:59,750
So it's a good idea just to click Update now that will leave us on the same screen and when the parent

93
00:11:06,620 --> 00:11:11,720
I've got a success message read appear at the top you know I could have done that theme update just

94
00:11:17,840 --> 00:11:18,570
the bottom.

95
00:11:18,860 --> 00:11:24,920
Well now I don't have an update Knag right here at the top nor any notifications down on my side menus

96
00:11:27,950 --> 00:11:34,580
And if I go to this Updates page you could see that everything is updated and there now I do want to

97
00:11:41,990 --> 00:11:44,270
or on my Web site at all.

98
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:48,210
This looks great just like we had set it up before.

99
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:53,600
Excellent and I'll go down to the bottom and make sure my customization here in the child theme is still

100
00:11:56,220 --> 00:11:57,300
That looks great.

101
00:11:58,350 --> 00:12:04,530
Now it's worth noting that you can deactivate a theme if you introduce an update and it does break the

102
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:13,230
You would just go back into your file structure either via FCP or via the Explorer or the finder.

103
00:12:17,100 --> 00:12:23,550
Open up themes and identify which theme you just updated that's causing the problem and you can go through

104
00:12:30,940 --> 00:12:35,980
In this lesson you worked on one of your previous WordPress installations either locally or at your

105
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,190
You also looked at how you would go about deactivating a plug in or theme.

106
00:12:43,270 --> 00:12:48,310
In the case that the update has caused a problem in the next video we'll look at some different options

107
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:56,620
There are a bunch of different third party services many free with paid upgrades that can make it easier

108
00:13:00,250 --> 00:13:05,470
You can manage a group of Wordpress sites for yourself or for your clients saving time by accessing

109
00:13:09,670 --> 00:13:10,180
