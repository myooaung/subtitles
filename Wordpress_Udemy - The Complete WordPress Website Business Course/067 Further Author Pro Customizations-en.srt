1
00:00:00,940 --> 00:00:05,220
In this video we'll finish up some specific customisations to the author pro-side.

2
00:00:05,230 --> 00:00:10,690
We've been working on will populate the footer widget areas with content and explore the use of the

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:18,700
By the end of this lesson you will have explored all the author pro plug ins custom content display

4
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:28,690
Let's start by opening up the dashboard and again going into appearance widgets we'll be looking at

5
00:00:33,310 --> 00:00:37,440
Each one can have whatever we want in there and in the first one.

6
00:00:37,450 --> 00:00:45,070
Lets open up and looked look at this one is just a title that is a text widget that has something to

7
00:00:48,100 --> 00:00:54,910
And then secondly there is the genesis simple social icons a plug in that is free and the repository

8
00:01:00,520 --> 00:01:04,500
parallax pro sample inside your students sandbox.

9
00:01:04,510 --> 00:01:09,760
Lets open up the site inside another tab and take a look at what we have going on.

10
00:01:15,370 --> 00:01:22,660
nice blue color which is a secondary color or alternate color that weve got set inside the author proceeds

11
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:24,980
theme at the moment.

12
00:01:25,120 --> 00:01:33,130
So the first thing we want to do is basically arrange these icons so that they'll fit all in one line

13
00:01:33,370 --> 00:01:39,320
or in two lines we can control the size of these icons and the color of these icons.

14
00:01:39,340 --> 00:01:41,800
So that's your first challenge for this video.

15
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,690
or larger to make them lay out in a nice layout.

16
00:01:59,810 --> 00:02:05,590
The first thing I look at is how are these icons going to display at the widest size.

17
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:10,730
You're looking at my screen here on my large 22 inch desktop monitor.

18
00:02:10,850 --> 00:02:17,360
So I know that if I drag my window across and make it smaller I can look at how the mobile responsiveness

19
00:02:17,690 --> 00:02:20,270
works within this theme.

20
00:02:20,450 --> 00:02:28,400
So I don't like the way it looks with the single icon below the 4 in the first or the second iteration

21
00:02:35,420 --> 00:02:36,270
and two.

22
00:02:36,500 --> 00:02:41,960
And as I get smaller Yeah that's going to look good.

23
00:02:49,910 --> 00:02:57,580
a row so I'll either make this a little bit larger so that it shows in two rows in my larger screen

24
00:02:57,820 --> 00:03:01,140
or I can make them smaller so that it shows in one row.

25
00:03:01,330 --> 00:03:02,590
Well how go about that.

26
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,740
and you can see it under simple social icons.

27
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:20,980
I've got both a size and a radius some information that I can choose to to work on the size and the

28
00:03:32,230 --> 00:03:36,740
colors what color it's going to turn when I roll my mouse over it.

29
00:03:37,060 --> 00:03:43,900
And then each time I put a link or in this case a placeholder I can choose how many social I kind of

30
00:03:46,030 --> 00:03:52,600
So for me I'm going to leave it at the number 5 5 items and I'm going to make those I think a whole

31
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:01,000
I've got plenty of room inside of my footer widgets and really let's see what happens if we double the

32
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:10,790
look.

33
00:04:13,910 --> 00:04:14,490
Now.

34
00:04:14,650 --> 00:04:14,960
OK.

35
00:04:18,230 --> 00:04:23,070
I don't want my footer widget area to get too tall.

36
00:04:31,340 --> 00:04:36,010
90 pixels.

37
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:42,800
Hope this was the process that you went through just trying to make your layout look good.

38
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:43,460
I like that.

39
00:04:43,470 --> 00:04:45,720
I like the five different ones.

40
00:04:45,950 --> 00:04:51,450
Now let's find out what this blue color is and let's make the roll over of our social sharing icons

41
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:54,400
that same blue color.

42
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:55,620
So how am I going to find that out.

43
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:05,910
One thing I know is that under a perience customize inside of the customize or I'll have some controls

44
00:05:09,810 --> 00:05:15,090
Here's the site colors and there's my accent color and that's where it is being used for the menu items

45
00:05:18,450 --> 00:05:28,740
So if I just select that I'll choose the color number without the hash tag symbol and that's just close

46
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:34,200
Let's change the color

47
00:05:37,010 --> 00:05:39,740
in my simple social icons widget.

48
00:05:40,750 --> 00:05:48,540
So I get to select that and hit Control V to paste that color and then I'll save it

49
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:52,050
great.

50
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:58,410
And I don't need a second text widget to push the size up.

51
00:05:58,830 --> 00:06:01,000
Boy I like the way that blue looks.

52
00:06:01,170 --> 00:06:03,630
So I'm going to go and see.

53
00:06:12,140 --> 00:06:15,480
I mean the title the simple social icons widget

54
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:24,350
and I'm going to get rid of that second text widget that I had over here just by dragging it across

55
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:27,280
and letting it go by deactivating it over here.

56
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:29,580
Right.

57
00:06:29,630 --> 00:06:33,960
Let's take a look at our results and then we'll go to the next stage.

58
00:06:33,980 --> 00:06:34,760
It looks great.

59
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:47,300
Let's use one of the Genesis featured book widgets and placed them here with a link and maybe just a

60
00:06:54,530 --> 00:06:57,260
that a try.

61
00:06:57,270 --> 00:06:58,190
How did it go.

62
00:06:58,200 --> 00:06:59,680
Should've been pretty simple for you.

63
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:01,620
I would think here's how I'd go about it.

64
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:16,830
I'm going to play a Genesis author pro featured book widget and again this is pretty easy to do.

65
00:07:16,980 --> 00:07:23,910
And this widget is provided by the author pro plugin which gives us a real easy way to go ahead and

66
00:07:28,110 --> 00:07:34,440
So if I just pick one of the books we have that one featured above on the homepage so maybe I'll choose

67
00:07:34,860 --> 00:07:35,670
a different book.

68
00:07:37,830 --> 00:07:44,950
I use the author pro image thumbnail size leave it none and then it'll be just centered within the widget.

69
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:50,310
I want to show the featured text if it has it and show the title.

70
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:03,800
any content and just have a button that says View book it's time let's show the price to see what that

71
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:08,590
Click save and then I'll refresh the page over in my other tab.

72
00:08:10,980 --> 00:08:13,620
Great now that's pretty large.

73
00:08:17,550 --> 00:08:18,570
And here is the view book.

74
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,950
Maybe the 150 by 150 thumbnail and click save

75
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:35,960
that looks a little bit better.

76
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:42,360
That shows only partially the book cover but it does give me a nice small widget to go alongside my

77
00:08:45,690 --> 00:08:51,810
Now what if I wanted to have that thumbnail instead of a square thumbnail actually have the proportions

78
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:58,470
of the book itself and show the title of the book the entire book cover that would be a good challenge

79
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:08,820
And if you can remember how to regenerate your thumbnails you can change the thumbnail from being cut

80
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:18,860
Plaza video now and see if you can figure that one out.

81
00:09:20,650 --> 00:09:22,730
How'd it go with changing the thumbnail size.

82
00:09:23,550 --> 00:09:25,420
Back inside the Wordpress dashboard.

83
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:26,950
I'll show you what I would do.

84
00:09:27,030 --> 00:09:31,110
First I'm going to check my settings media.

85
00:09:31,220 --> 00:09:38,000
You know I look like I want to see it says Krop thumbnail to exact dimensions and leave it proportional

86
00:09:40,700 --> 00:09:42,230
But then it's the right size.

87
00:09:49,030 --> 00:09:51,950
This is only for newly uploaded images.

88
00:09:57,050 --> 00:09:59,570
to plug ins and activate it.

89
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:07,980
in.

90
00:10:18,250 --> 00:10:20,410
the video here and let that finish.

91
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:21,320
OK.

92
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:22,650
My message is success.

93
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:27,110
All 45 images were so successfully resized.

94
00:10:27,300 --> 00:10:29,890
So what happens when I refresh the page.

95
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:35,670
It will be pulling the thumbnail in and there it is a nice book cover that shows the entire book cover

96
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:38,870
and it's not cut off at the top.

97
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:46,310
Now if I wanted this to be slightly larger I think 150 pixels is a little bit small for this.

98
00:10:46,500 --> 00:10:53,310
So I might just quickly go in and change my media settings once again and it's OK to regenerate your

99
00:10:55,050 --> 00:11:00,100
I'd like to see this it 200 pixels instead of 150.

100
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,450
It save changes undermine media settings and then I can just go into tools and regenerate the thumbnails.

101
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,850
Once again I'll pause the video here and let it finish.

102
00:11:10,950 --> 00:11:11,220
Great.

103
00:11:11,230 --> 00:11:17,580
That just took a couple of quick seconds and I'm going back to my live page and refreshing it.

104
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:20,160
And that looks like a better size to me.

105
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:27,180
What happens when I go back to appearance with it's just one more thing I know that that's justified

106
00:11:34,300 --> 00:11:40,380
I'm going to take my image alignment instead of none and make that centered and click save and let's

107
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:46,770
That looks better.

108
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:57,330
Now this footer is going to appear on every page of the website below whatever content we're working

109
00:11:57,940 --> 00:12:05,100
So let's place a recent posts with you here that will update when the author or authors create a new

110
00:12:11,900 --> 00:12:17,730
and lay it out so that the number of posts showing fits with the height of these other widgets in the

111
00:12:19,330 --> 00:12:21,290
Give it a go.

112
00:12:21,340 --> 00:12:23,360
I'm sure that was super easy for you.

113
00:12:23,710 --> 00:12:26,300
Let me show you I'd go back into widgets here.

114
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:30,540
Close up footer number two and under footer three.

115
00:12:30,700 --> 00:12:35,100
I'm just going to bring a recent posts widget over here.

116
00:12:35,250 --> 00:12:42,850
I think maybe I'd be able to show 10 and if I don't have a post title here I'll just use the default

117
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:46,100
recent posts and that's fine for now.

118
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:51,690
So as I save that widget and give a refresh or was it laid out.

119
00:12:51,730 --> 00:12:52,530
Great.

120
00:12:52,660 --> 00:12:57,370
Nice links that over with the beautiful blue color.

121
00:12:57,380 --> 00:13:04,910
Now if I look at a single post behind Iceland eats as I go down here the next thing after the post is

122
00:13:06,710 --> 00:13:14,300
The last thing will do in this lesson is to use the Genesis powerd after entry widget area and what

123
00:13:18,440 --> 00:13:25,580
In this case and the author pro-team and it shows some content that we might want after every blog post

124
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:40,490
web store or something like that would be a very appropriate piece of content for this widget.

125
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:55,020
entry and most Genesys powered studio press themes there's an after entry widget says right here widgets

126
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:05,990
Now just quickly inside of this after entry widget I'm going to drag across a special Gensis widget

127
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,050
Very useful for this area.

128
00:14:11,090 --> 00:14:18,950
You can just say about the author or something similar and then what it's doing is it's pulling data

129
00:14:19,160 --> 00:14:28,040
from the user's account within Wordpress and so which you can choose whichever user you'd like to use

130
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:36,230
and then it's using a Gravatar which is a visual account which brings an image in Gravatar as a company

131
00:14:42,650 --> 00:14:48,200
and it's a good place to associate your email address with an image so that you can use that same image

132
00:14:51,380 --> 00:14:55,820
But you can choose the size of the Gravatar of course if there is none it will show the little mystery

133
00:15:01,190 --> 00:15:05,870
You can use the author bio which is one of the items inside of your profile here.

134
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:13,160
Or you can use custom text below and then you can use one of your pages as a linked page within this

135
00:15:13,250 --> 00:15:14,470
widget here.

136
00:15:14,750 --> 00:15:18,610
Read more perhaps about the author.

137
00:15:18,650 --> 00:15:21,950
I'm just going to use this is about me.

138
00:15:22,400 --> 00:15:29,300
Just as some sample text right here and then we can click save an author archive link we'll link to

139
00:15:33,980 --> 00:15:40,650
So let's go down and see what that looks like if I open a particular blog post like this one.

140
00:15:41,060 --> 00:15:48,050
When I scroll down to the bottom and I've got yes there's the Gravatar image and a read more link goes

141
00:15:51,170 --> 00:15:58,010
In this lesson it used existing content to populate the footer and after entry widget areas some of

142
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:06,740
Some of it provided by the author pro plugin like the featured book widget and some conditional like

143
00:16:13,760 --> 00:16:17,060
post pages in the Web site in the next video.

144
00:16:17,150 --> 00:16:22,190
You'll use the book cover Photoshop image that's provided by Studio press with the author pro theme

145
00:16:22,520 --> 00:16:28,370
and learn how it uses an overlay within its layers to make the left side of the image look like a bookbinding.

146
00:16:28,580 --> 00:16:29,280
Let's check it out
