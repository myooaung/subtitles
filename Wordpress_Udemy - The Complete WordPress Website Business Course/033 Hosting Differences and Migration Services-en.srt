00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,120
Taking a WordPress site live on the Internet is slightly different depending on which hosting company

2
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,220
I'll go through the hosting companies I use and recommend and show their differences.

3
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:18,930
And the best way to migrate existing sites to their platform will also go over how to set up staging

4
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:26,130
On each of the live platforms by the end you'll have a feel for several different types of hosting and

5
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,000
Let's get going.

6
00:00:31,400 --> 00:00:37,430
Let's start by opening our local development environment as usual by starting map making sure the server

7
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,340
And then let's take a look at our brochure dash site.

8
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:52,840
site to a live environment.

9
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:02,220
As we've done before the first thing we're going to do is log into Wordpress the original site and we're

10
00:01:09,650 --> 00:01:16,170
So I'll just go ahead and export to file and when that's finished I'll be back.

11
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:21,150
Now that it's finished I'll click download and we'll save it.

12
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:36,390
as usual I open two different windows in Windows Explorer one to my downloads and another where I want

13
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:43,410
I already have one backup.

14
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,660
And I also have that sequel file.

15
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:56,940
One of the things you may want to do is just label them by date so that you know which are the latest

16
00:01:57,330 --> 00:01:59,520
backup files.

17
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:13,430
And so that's also a good way to conveniently keep track of your downloads and your backups.

18
00:02:13,460 --> 00:02:20,900
So now that I know where that backup file is on my desktop inside of the folder called brochure site

19
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:30,400
and then inside of that folder by date now I can go to a new WordPress installation and I can download

20
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:37,360
and install and activate that plug in called All-In-One WP migration and then import the backup into

21
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:42,360
Here's a challenge for you.

22
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:48,680
Go to your site Ground account and create a new fresh WordPress installation using the Wordpress installer

23
00:02:48,770 --> 00:02:51,260
in the see panel.

24
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:53,000
I hope doing that was easy for you.

25
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:54,230
Here's a quick review.

26
00:02:54,340 --> 00:03:00,570
Hit the Wordpress installer and you know you're going to install it into a new directory on your main

27
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:01,290
site.

28
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,270
and create that folder like you would when you were installing WordPress manually.

29
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:19,440
What we're going to place it in any directory and then fill out the rest of the information and install

30
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:26,570
Now that it's installed I can just click the admin you are el link right in that see panel soft tactless

31
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:29,560
installer and I'm already logged in.

32
00:03:29,670 --> 00:03:36,260
I can go into plugins and add new and find all in one migration and get my migration done.

33
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:43,500
You can also use your free flywheel staging area to migrate your local site into but either way grab

34
00:03:54,490 --> 00:04:00,190
now down here I'll click Import and I'm importing it from a file locally.

35
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:09,800
Where I Put It was on my desktop inside of the brochure site folder.

36
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:19,470
Now this might take a little bit of time because I'm uploading directly to the internet on my server.

37
00:04:21,080 --> 00:04:23,550
That took about 10 minutes to upload.

38
00:04:23,620 --> 00:04:30,020
I'll continue and it's going to go ahead and restore it and again I'll pause the video and I didn't

39
00:04:36,530 --> 00:04:42,940
Save button twice.

40
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:44,160
There we go.

41
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:49,730
And save changes one more time.

42
00:04:49,740 --> 00:04:55,910
Gosh I can really sense the speed of this flywheel hosting when I go to any page it's no time at all

43
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:07,680
I think I have an exact copy restored version of the site that we had locally but this one is live on

44
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:16,910
Under this you are now since we're talking about hosting staging areas and site migration.

45
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:23,900
I thought I'd show you how automated staging at the hosting level can be very convenient for making

46
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:36,800
Your free server environment is equivalent to their startup which is only good for one domain at a time.

47
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:43,440
And when you go down to the staging feature it's only accessible through there.

48
00:05:43,450 --> 00:05:49,910
Third level on the shared program the go geek which on sale is four thousand ninety five a month and

49
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:57,180
the regular price is almost $30 a month but you get unlimited web sites and a lot of other features.

50
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:05,150
Let me just show you very quickly my staging area at my personal site ground site in my cloud hosting

51
00:06:08,840 --> 00:06:15,500
If I just go to the see panel This will give me a see panel where I'm accessing every account that I

52
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:30,680
You can see that it will automatically create a staging copy for any of the websites I have installed

53
00:06:32,060 --> 00:06:39,560
So for Greg Davis dot com For example if I just click Create a staging copy I can choose to make a copy

54
00:06:42,740 --> 00:06:48,650
But I don't have to I could just click Continue to the username and password for the staging environment

55
00:06:54,560 --> 00:07:02,890
live using one single click after I've made my changes and tested them over at flywheel.

56
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:09,860
There is a similar staging feature that I'll just give you a quick tour on.

57
00:07:10,300 --> 00:07:18,580
And once you have one of your web sites open for example wild food girl if I go over into staging You

58
00:07:24,940 --> 00:07:31,470
And then I can bring it back live using just a single click in this video.

59
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,720
to our live development environment.

60
00:07:40,750 --> 00:07:48,490
I went over the hosting companies that I use that are all available to you free or inexpensively.

61
00:07:48,590 --> 00:07:54,530
Next we're going to set up a local staging area so that we can make changes to the live web site without
