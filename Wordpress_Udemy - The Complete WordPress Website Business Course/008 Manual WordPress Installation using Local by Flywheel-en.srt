1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,310
Every server including local environments and live hosting servers on the internet works a little bit

2
00:00:07,210 --> 00:00:13,310
And so this is an example of how WordPress could be installed manually using local by flywheel.

3
00:00:13,510 --> 00:00:19,180
Coming up in this chapter I'll show you how I installed WordPress manually using another local environment

4
00:00:20,590 --> 00:00:23,970
But you should follow along in whichever environment you have.

5
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,810
You can refer back to this video later or follow along now.

6
00:00:27,880 --> 00:00:33,010
And in doing this you'll get a feel for how WordPress works and the way it connects the core files to

7
00:00:34,330 --> 00:00:41,270
Let's go now I'm going to create a new WordPress installation in local by flywheel and I suggest you

8
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:50,600
So I'm going to go ahead and log out of my practice site one close the tabs and I'm going to close that

9
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,270
on this site instead I'm going to turn this site off.

10
00:01:03,320 --> 00:01:10,400
So practice site one is now turned off and I have a second one called practice site 2 that I've just

11
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:20,560
And I did a very default installation with no changes at all and I called it practice site too.

12
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:27,410
So stop the video if you like and hit the plus sign and set up a second site that we're going to do

13
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:33,060
Or you can just follow along here.

14
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:40,440
The reason I use local by flywheel to create the installation first and then go ahead and change it

15
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,860
by flywheel sets up the config file so that it's already connected to the database.

16
00:01:54,930 --> 00:02:00,600
That way when we install WordPress manually We know that all the credentials are correct.

17
00:02:01,510 --> 00:02:09,000
Now let's first take a look at the file structure for this practice site to give you an open file explorer

18
00:02:09,010 --> 00:02:18,010
again and I'll go back to my local sites folder in my username under users on the main hard drive and

19
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:29,270
You can see that these are the files that are the Word Press Corps files.

20
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:36,580
And like I mentioned in the last video if we go to WordPress dot org and we download this zip file and

21
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:45,280
These are the exact files that will end up with from that zip file with the exception of the WP config

22
00:02:46,030 --> 00:02:48,860
file that was created from the sample.

23
00:02:49,090 --> 00:02:58,260
Let's open the WPE could fig dash sample that ph file in a text or a code editor.

24
00:02:58,270 --> 00:03:02,210
Now I have it open in my Adam code editor right here.

25
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:09,150
And you can see that it's just got some default data for the database name and the user and the password

26
00:03:09,160 --> 00:03:14,230
and what the host name is which by default might be localhost.

27
00:03:24,490 --> 00:03:30,890
has been created by WordPress when local by flywheel installed it.

28
00:03:30,970 --> 00:03:32,080
So you can see the difference.

29
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:40,190
The password is root and the host name is localhost.

30
00:03:40,540 --> 00:03:48,100
And also there are some salts or unique keys and phrases down here that we will set up in a later video

31
00:03:48,370 --> 00:03:52,100
when we do a manual installation in the next section.

32
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:58,150
That's just to show you what you would get if you downloaded WordPress from WordPress dark instead of

33
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:10,990
I'm just going to make the assumption that this is the file these are the same files and the W.P. config

34
00:04:11,980 --> 00:04:16,130
file is already set up for this server.

35
00:04:16,150 --> 00:04:21,910
However the main change that we're going to make so that we can go through the Wordpress installation

36
00:04:29,620 --> 00:04:32,390
database as we did in the last video.

37
00:04:32,530 --> 00:04:37,820
Click the database tab here and click add Mynor for this Web site.

38
00:04:38,140 --> 00:04:42,330
Now you can make sure you're in the right Web site up in the address bar of your browser.

39
00:04:42,340 --> 00:04:49,480
This one is my practice site to local and so I know I'm in the right database and what I'm going to

40
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,590
There's 12 in total.

41
00:04:59,470 --> 00:05:05,170
And then after that I'm going to come down here and click drop when I click a drop gives me a window

42
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:13,280
to leave the database intact.

43
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,270
We're just erasing an existing database.

44
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:17,640
OK.

45
00:05:17,710 --> 00:05:20,110
And now the message in admen or tells me OK.

46
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,050
In this database there are no tables.

47
00:05:23,210 --> 00:05:27,450
So how are we going to get the tables back and get this working.

48
00:05:27,490 --> 00:05:37,060
If I go right now to local buy flywheel with the empty database and I click say View site and I click

49
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:48,330
Now the Wordpress files are in place and the Word Press W.P. config file is correct.

50
00:05:48,340 --> 00:05:51,390
It's actually communicating with the database correctly.

51
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:57,150
The reason I know that is because this is the first step of setting up WordPress manually.

52
00:05:57,580 --> 00:06:03,340
So now I'm going to go through this process which is a script they use called the famous five minute

53
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:11,410
Now so many hosts and local environments install WordPress automatically that you may not have to go

54
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:23,290
And now since we're already connected to the database it just needs a little bit of information about

55
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:25,600
what the word press is going to entail.

56
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:37,240
And this is the welcome message Welcome to the famous five minute WordPress installation process.

57
00:06:37,330 --> 00:06:39,010
And so let's see.

58
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:51,840
I use my standard username and then I'm going to choose a password that I know I'll be able to remember.

59
00:06:51,940 --> 00:06:53,380
It doesn't have to be that

60
00:06:55,870 --> 00:07:00,730
difficult or that strong of a password since this isn't a public facing Web site.

61
00:07:00,970 --> 00:07:03,180
Nobody can access this on the web.

62
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,800
And then there needs to be an email address

63
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:13,190
for each user account.

64
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:18,410
And then you can choose discouraging search engine visibility on a live server.

65
00:07:18,460 --> 00:07:23,710
You might do that in order to develop the site or hide it behind a maintenance screen.

66
00:07:23,860 --> 00:07:30,640
In either case you don't need to check that box and I'll click install Wordpress and I can save that

67
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,500
And that was it success.

68
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:40,000
WordPress has been installed so I can click the logon button which brings me to that standard log in

69
00:07:45,370 --> 00:07:47,310
And here we are our practice site 2.

70
00:07:47,590 --> 00:07:50,000
And I can right click.

71
00:07:50,060 --> 00:07:57,190
Visit site and open that new tab and I have my standard default fresh and clean WordPress installation.

72
00:07:57,250 --> 00:07:58,300
Ready to go.

73
00:07:58,360 --> 00:08:05,560
Now let's take a look at the database that's still open and let's just refresh the page and you could

74
00:08:08,650 --> 00:08:12,800
Let's just verify under W.P. options and select data.

75
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:13,550
Yeah.

76
00:08:13,570 --> 00:08:20,960
There's the practice site to local same Yoro that I have up here and so that worked for me.

77
00:08:20,980 --> 00:08:30,040
The quick quick quick WordPress five minute installation process and that's how we do it in the next

78
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:37,390
You'll see that I teach you how to install WordPress manually using the map local development environment

79
00:08:37,810 --> 00:08:44,230
and I've added this local by a flywheel system in ahead of that because I find that it's much easier

80
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:55,870
But follow along if you like you can continue to use local by flywheel instead of map and in the next

81
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:06,670
In this lesson I showed you how you can use local by flywheel to experiment with installing WordPress

82
00:09:07,750 --> 00:09:13,240
It's a good exercise just to get familiar with how WordPress works to connect the files to the database

83
00:09:13,870 --> 00:09:14,770
in the future.

84
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,570
automatically in the next video.

85
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:28,630
We'll explore different types of hosting environments for Wordpress including another local development

86
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:37,450
Feel free to just follow along with the map lessons but keep using local instead.
