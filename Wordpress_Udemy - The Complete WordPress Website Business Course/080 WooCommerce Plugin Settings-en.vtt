00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:06.670
In this video you'll install and activate the newcomers plug in as well as import a sample set of products

2
00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:08.340
and check out the settings.

3
00:00:08.530 --> 00:00:13.420
We'll be preparing a storefront website to display products and provide a shopping cart and check out

4
00:00:20.410 --> 00:00:25.830
And there are plans to eventually incorporate it into the core files instead of being a separate plugin.

5
00:00:25.960 --> 00:00:31.000
By learning to work with wordpress e-commerce functionality through the WU comer's plug in you'll be

6
00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:43.480
Let's start by just checking out the newcomers Web site and finding out where the support documents

7
00:00:45.670 --> 00:00:47.250
Have to look something up.

8
00:00:47.290 --> 00:00:53.050
So if you navigate to new comers dotcom you'll see their Web site right here and you can get some good

9
00:00:54.570 --> 00:00:59.320
Newcomer's powers over 30 percent of all online stores.

10
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:11.410
and they do have commercial plug ins that are add ons for certain functionality for wude comer's that's

11
00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:22.390
over with commerce up in the menu here.

12
00:01:22.510 --> 00:01:26.050
You can see that this is where the documentation is.

13
00:01:26.140 --> 00:01:32.260
Now I went and searched the documentation for how to import some sample data so that we have something

14
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:41.860
It says that it's located inside of the newcomers zip file but if you've already installed the plug

15
00:01:45.310 --> 00:01:52.750
File Manager to go and find that ex-MIL file just in the same way that we did in a previous part of

16
00:01:56.040 --> 00:02:03.980
SML file using the Wordpress importer will want to work with one of our live Web sites for this one

17
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:11.750
and so I'm going to use my MailChimp test site and just repurpose it for the WU commerce plugin and

18
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:13.830
set up that we're going to be making.

19
00:02:13.910 --> 00:02:21.290
I can just remove these sidebar widgets will be using a different theme provided by newcomers and I

20
00:02:27.620 --> 00:02:32.990
those two MailChimp widgets for now and just drag them over this way.

21
00:02:33.110 --> 00:02:39.230
That way I'm getting rid of those two MailChimp widgets and I can just leave MailChimp for W.P. activated

22
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:44.180
as it has a new commerce extension which is an integration that they provide.

23
00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.740
Here are the newcomers check out integration is available.

24
00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:56.330
Once you get the new comers plug in.

25
00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:03.820
hosting.

26
00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:10.370
Or go ahead and log in to the MailChimp WordPress dashboard that we were using in the last chapter.

27
00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:16.100
Then you can just do what I've done and reverse a couple of our changes that we made including going

28
00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:25.550
And go ahead and save your changes.

29
00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:29.770
Now that that's done.

30
00:03:29.830 --> 00:03:37.180
Follow along with me as we go to the plug ins add new page and will search and install and activate

31
00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:46.180
Just do a search for commerce.

32
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:46.980
There it is.

33
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:53.740
Now I already have it installed and so if you don't click install but I am going to go over to my install

34
00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.960
plugins page and activate it

35
00:03:59.290 --> 00:03:59.450
here.

36
00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:00.820
Just activate

37
00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:04.190
great now.

38
00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:10.320
One thing that newcomer's does that makes it really easy to get started is that they have a set up wizard.

39
00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.840
Now you can skip the setup and look at all the settings manually.

40
00:04:13.940 --> 00:04:19.460
But let's go ahead and run the setup wizard and we'll get started that way.

41
00:04:20.230 --> 00:04:26.500
So follow along on your own website and let's see what the set up wizard does for us to get us started

42
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:28.220
with newcomers.

43
00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.220
All right.

44
00:04:29.230 --> 00:04:34.190
So it's going to give us a little welcome message and you can click Let's go.

45
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:41.680
And then the pages your store needs a few essential pages so these pages the store will use and they're

46
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:51.340
And if they're not already created then the plugin will be creating these automatically.

47
00:04:51.370 --> 00:04:52.510
It's a good convenience.

48
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:06.070
Great so we can set up a few questions and you can fill out your answers for yourself here.

49
00:05:06.090 --> 00:05:18.450
My location is Colorado and I use the U.S. dollar and I'll use pounds and I'll use inches shipping and

50
00:05:19.170 --> 00:05:24.450
No I'm going to be setting up a digital downloads product instead of a physical goods product.

51
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:33.600
going to be charging sales tax just to make it easy and convenient.

52
00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:43.340
Now I do use Paypal already but Strype is another very good payment processor and so I'll be choosing

53
00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:46.100
whichever one is convenient for me.

54
00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:49.620
You know Pay-Pal standard check payments are available.

55
00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:51.950
Bank Transfer etc..

56
00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:02.090
And let's allow check payments as well.

57
00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:08.400
And I'll just hit continue great the store is ready already.

58
00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:11.700
That's OK for me to give it some diagnostic data or you can hit.

59
00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:12.830
No thanks.

60
00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:17.770
And then the next steps would be to create your first product.

61
00:06:23.710 --> 00:06:26.520
data that newcomer's will provide for us.

62
00:06:26.860 --> 00:06:32.230
So from here we can just click return to the Wordpress dashboard and the wizard has made some essential

63
00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:41.440
Let's open the pages and you can see that we've got four extra pages here cart and a checkout page and

64
00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:46.880
Sounds good.

65
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:54.190
Now as I mentioned there's two ways to get the ex-MIL file that we're going to be using to import the

66
00:06:58.270 --> 00:07:04.630
First of all just on the home page of newcomer's dot com you could see there's a free download button.

67
00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:11.320
This is probably the easier of the two ways if you just download the zip file and then uncompress or

68
00:07:11.350 --> 00:07:13.390
unzip it onto your computer.

69
00:07:13.570 --> 00:07:20.130
You can then go into the location they recommended and find that SML final file.

70
00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:22.670
So it's under plug ins.

71
00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.710
Woo commerce.

72
00:07:26.890 --> 00:07:33.700
And then there's a dummy data folder and there's a dummy dash data dot ex-MIL file that we're looking

73
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:43.910
If you'd rather you can use FCP or a file manager within your C panel and find the file yourself.

74
00:07:45.580 --> 00:07:49.920
Go ahead and do that and then come back and we'll import that file.

75
00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:59.260
Now in my C panel for Greg Davis dot com inside ground I go down to the file manager and it opens this

76
00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:05.950
It's very convenient.

77
00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:17.110
And now you can recognize and I'm sure you're familiar with these different word press corps files and

78
00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:20.620
So NWP dash content.

79
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:30.670
Here's the dummy data folder.

80
00:08:30.930 --> 00:08:36.530
And now I've got the dummy data dot ex-MIL file.

81
00:08:36.690 --> 00:08:45.750
So if I just double click that file it'll download it I click click save file and now I've got that

82
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:48.840
file right there in my downloads folder.

83
00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:56.870
I can get to it through going to Windows Explorer or if you're on a Mac you can find it using the Finder.

84
00:08:56.930 --> 00:09:00.710
What about themes for this chapter.

85
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:07.970
We're going to be working with newcomers and one of the newcomers themes that has a deep integration

86
00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:16.760
It's designed to work with any theme but there are some theme features in the theme we're going to be

87
00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:24.860
So if you roll over themes that newcomers dot com go down to e-commerce themes.

88
00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:27.550
The first one there is called storefront.

89
00:09:27.770 --> 00:09:34.060
Now storefront is a theme that like I said is integrated deeply with the newcomers plug in.

90
00:09:34.070 --> 00:09:43.040
It's made by wew themes and the newcomers company but they also sell child themes for the new comers

91
00:09:43.100 --> 00:09:45.090
storefront theme.

92
00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:50.500
But we're going to just customize and work with the storefront theme itself.

93
00:09:50.630 --> 00:09:56.960
And of course you can make your own child theme of storefront and do customisations within that child

94
00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.890
But we know that it's called storefront.

95
00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:10.880
So if we go back into our WordPress dashboard and then roll over appearance and click themes we'll be

96
00:10:17.330 --> 00:10:18.700
and activating it.

97
00:10:19.010 --> 00:10:25.090
So I just click Add new and when it comes up with my list of themes I can go to the right hand side

98
00:10:25.600 --> 00:10:33.870
and I'm just going to do a search for e-commerce storefronts for that search term.

99
00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:39.070
It pops up at the top left and then I can just click the install button.

100
00:10:39.130 --> 00:10:39.400
Great.

101
00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:51.590
Now that that theme is activated you can check it out by looking at this.

102
00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:03.280
It needs Wu commers to be activated and there's a little bit of news and different things that you can

103
00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:09.190
You can see that they advertise their child themes that they sell here if you're looking for something

104
00:11:10.390 --> 00:11:17.220
But for this chapter we're just going to be using the straight storefront theme all by itself.

105
00:11:17.290 --> 00:11:20.100
So a small challenge for this video.

106
00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:25.450
Go ahead and get the WU commerce dummy data SML file.

107
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:37.300
Pozza video now and then I'll show you how to do it.

108
00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.560
That was probably pretty easy for you if you recall.

109
00:11:40.580 --> 00:11:47.770
You need to go under Tools and click the import button and if you haven't already you need to install

110
00:11:50.350 --> 00:11:57.890
If I just click the browse button and go to my downloads I can see that I have that dummy data SML file

111
00:12:05.810 --> 00:12:08.530
file and import great.

112
00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:15.980
Sure.

113
00:12:16.030 --> 00:12:22.760
And then I'm going to click download an import file attachments and click submit lets go under products

114
00:12:23.150 --> 00:12:28.410
and click products and just take a look and see if we have any products.

115
00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:28.850
Nice.

116
00:12:30.110 --> 00:12:32.070
I have 23 items.

117
00:12:32.270 --> 00:12:39.170
And in fact I want to see them all on the same page so I'm just going to go up and use my screen options

118
00:12:43.760 --> 00:12:46.460
I've got they've got images on them.

119
00:12:54.830 --> 00:12:58.980
Now it looks just like a posts or a Pages editing screen.

120
00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.540
It's got a description something right here.

121
00:13:01.550 --> 00:13:08.750
It has a permalink and you can see that it uses a u r l with the word product and then the name which

122
00:13:11.660 --> 00:13:16.430
We've got a few more options down here it looks like there's product categories that you can use and

123
00:13:21.470 --> 00:13:25.100
This is a new custom post type called a product.

124
00:13:25.210 --> 00:13:27.330
And so it's got category's tags.

125
00:13:27.470 --> 00:13:30.050
And it's also got something called attributes.

126
00:13:30.110 --> 00:13:35.410
And so as we scroll down we can see that it's got a product image which is like a featured image.

127
00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:41.330
And then there's some product data down here at the bottom that the plug in gives us inside of this

128
00:13:41.540 --> 00:13:42.860
custom post-time.

129
00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:48.230
It's got a short description and it's got a lot of stuff that we'll explore in later videos in this

130
00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:56.220
The last thing under the name of your site.

131
00:13:56.240 --> 00:14:01.850
Mine is called MailChimp test site still you can see that you have a visit site button which is the

132
00:14:04.790 --> 00:14:11.050
But you also have a visit store button and so it's the r l of your site right here.

133
00:14:11.090 --> 00:14:12.710
Slash shop.

134
00:14:12.770 --> 00:14:19.160
So it's just right click and open that link in a new tab and see what our shop looks like for now.

135
00:14:19.430 --> 00:14:20.990
This looks excellent.

136
00:14:25.380 --> 00:14:33.350
The my account and the shop button and you can see I've got a grid lay out with buttons prices ratings

137
00:14:33.380 --> 00:14:37.710
and images for each of the products inside of the store.

138
00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:41.530
Awesome in this lesson.

139
00:14:41.630 --> 00:14:48.320
You set up a live site with the newcomers plug in as well as an e-commerce theme made for Commerce called

140
00:14:48.470 --> 00:14:49.680
storefront.

141
00:14:49.820 --> 00:14:55.940
You also imported a file from commerce that loaded your site up with products and product attributes

142
00:14:56.150 --> 00:15:01.410
so that you can work on setting up and customizing your web store in the next video.

143
00:15:01.430 --> 00:15:07.340
We'll explore the custom post types that the new comers plug in provides as well as the taxonomies and
