00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:04.020
Hi we didn't this lecture we going to learn about the subject.

2
00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.950
Cold gesture recognizes.

3
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:13.920
So we will be able to recognize the gestures that users do when they use their phone like swiping or

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:15.180
tapping on the phone.

5
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.880
So we're going gonna see have to do that.

6
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.290
So let me create this project and called his gesture recognizes.

7
00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:23.170
Okay.

8
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.200
And list.

9
00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:31.030
Let's just go with swift and do not check switch UI or card data.

10
00:00:31.110 --> 00:00:34.820
So let me create this on my guess complete folder.

11
00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:36.320
Okay.

12
00:00:36.510 --> 00:00:43.420
And in this project I'm actually going to finish what we have started in our first app.

13
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:51.350
Remember in the first app we have brought in an image inside of an Image view and we have created that

14
00:00:51.350 --> 00:00:52.260
button.

15
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:56.760
And then the user clicked on that button image we changed.

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.480
So we're going to do the exact same thing in here.

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.710
But right now instead of a button we want the user to click on the Image view itself.

18
00:01:07.020 --> 00:01:07.960
OK.

19
00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.230
And then the image will change.

20
00:01:10.230 --> 00:01:17.880
And also I'm going to make it in a way that I if user taps on the Image view one more time the user

21
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:21.050
will see the previous image one more time.

22
00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:28.470
So the image will be constantly changing when user taps on this image.

23
00:01:28.470 --> 00:01:34.880
So we're going to do that and we will not use a button for that.

24
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:39.770
So far we have been writing our actions the inside of buttons.

25
00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:44.730
So right now we're going to see how to write some new actions.

26
00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:52.170
So let me go to Google and for usual I'm going to go for Metallica or James Hetfield OK let me go for

27
00:01:52.170 --> 00:02:00.600
James Hetfield In case you don't know he is from Metallica so I'm going to save this image to my downloads

28
00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:06.540
and I'm also going to go for another picture which is Lars Ulrich.

29
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:07.810
OK.

30
00:02:07.830 --> 00:02:13.800
So just find two images that you want to change and display in your app.

31
00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:15.750
So this is in my case.

32
00:02:15.750 --> 00:02:17.540
James and Lars.

33
00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:26.290
So let me go to my downloads and let me make these images somewhat readable like James Stock JP last

34
00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:27.280
up JP.

35
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:28.130
OK.

36
00:02:28.270 --> 00:02:30.790
I'm going to take both of these pictures.

37
00:02:30.820 --> 00:02:36.150
I'm going to put those pictures in my SS folder so that's it.

38
00:02:36.150 --> 00:02:44.640
So we're now ready to get these images to display in our image view inside of our we've controller.

39
00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.320
So let me just take an image view from the library and drag and drop from here.

40
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.770
OK.

41
00:02:52.210 --> 00:02:56.790
And we're going to make this a little bit bigger so we can see it better.

42
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:03.300
We're not even going to have a button over here so we can make it bigger It doesn't matter.

43
00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:07.140
So let me start with James first and that's it.

44
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:08.290
That's our image view.

45
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:09.530
OK.

46
00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:16.380
So I'm going to create a label as low and in this label I'm going to display the name of James.

47
00:03:16.380 --> 00:03:21.780
And when I click to change the James the label will change it as well.

48
00:03:21.810 --> 00:03:27.320
So the image will turn to Lars and the label will also turn to.

49
00:03:27.330 --> 00:03:37.320
Laughs So for a starter I'm going to make this James Hetfield so make this into a central way like this.

50
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.100
And that's it.

51
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:39.250
That's our app.

52
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.950
We don't need anything else.

53
00:03:41.340 --> 00:03:49.530
So I'm going to go to my controller dot swift in and another editor and I'm going to drag and drop this

54
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:52.550
image of you in here like this.

55
00:03:52.660 --> 00:03:53.690
OK.

56
00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:58.820
I'm doing this fast because we have done it so many times right.

57
00:03:58.890 --> 00:04:00.820
So you can do it on your own.

58
00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:05.850
So this is my label and we're done for this.

59
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:10.680
So let me close these down and before we forget let's give some constraints.

60
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:18.360
Let's click here and say reset to suggest that constraints and then we can go to coding section.

61
00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:27.530
Now what we want to do we want to create a set up in which view recognize when a user taps on the image.

62
00:04:27.570 --> 00:04:28.450
Right.

63
00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:36.210
So we have defined our image view in here as an outlet not as an action.

64
00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:41.940
So we do actions in buttons but in regular reviews we do not do that.

65
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.590
Instead we create something called gesture recognizes.

66
00:04:46.590 --> 00:04:52.840
So let me first say Image view dot is user interaction enabled.

67
00:04:53.400 --> 00:05:00.820
So this defines whether we can better a user can actually interact with this you are not.

68
00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:02.590
So this has to be true.

69
00:05:02.650 --> 00:05:09.100
If this is false then Vedder I just as a gesture recognize or not.

70
00:05:09.100 --> 00:05:10.390
It won't work.

71
00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:16.360
So this can be clickable this can be terrible before we create a tap recognized.

72
00:05:16.510 --> 00:05:21.750
OK so I'm going to create my gesture recognized like this.

73
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:29.440
I'm going to of course I sign it to be a variable and I'm going to say you I tap gesture recognized.

74
00:05:30.070 --> 00:05:32.740
So as you can see we have other options as well.

75
00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:39.300
But this is a recognized that looks for a single or multiple taps.

76
00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:45.200
So I can decide what will happen when a user taps on this.

77
00:05:45.220 --> 00:05:52.230
So if you open the parenthesis it will ask me for a target and then action just like we did before.

78
00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:53.520
Remember.

79
00:05:53.560 --> 00:05:56.050
So remember what was the target.

80
00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.390
So target is.

81
00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:03.690
So let me open the documentation actually so you can see where the target is in here as well.

82
00:06:03.970 --> 00:06:12.970
So Target is D class or D place that the selector function is going to be called from.

83
00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:13.770
Okay.

84
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:17.910
In our case this target is actually the view controller itself.

85
00:06:17.980 --> 00:06:19.000
Because why.

86
00:06:19.060 --> 00:06:22.260
Because we're going to create an action here.

87
00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.680
So we're going to actually write a function and re going to select that function in this action.

88
00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:32.980
And this function will be called from view controller.

89
00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:41.560
So I'm going to write something targeted and I'm going to say hash selector in order to give my objective

90
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:43.330
c method over here.

91
00:06:43.390 --> 00:06:47.220
So how do we do that remember Objective C func.

92
00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.690
Okay and then you write your own function.

93
00:06:52.690 --> 00:06:55.850
So in my function I want to change the picture.

94
00:06:55.850 --> 00:07:01.470
Okay so I'm going to name it change pick and open curly braces.

95
00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.240
So right now I can come here and say this selector is change pick.

96
00:07:07.270 --> 00:07:17.060
So this is not very different than what we have seen when we deal that you a button creation with code.

97
00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:18.010
Right.

98
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:22.870
So the target is self and the action is this selector.

99
00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:28.270
So now we have to assign this gesture recognizing here to our Image view.

100
00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:34.540
So I'm going to say add gesture recognize and it will ask me for a one and I will give you what we have

101
00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:35.320
created.

102
00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:42.370
Now they are connected and while they were I right here like tapped will be happening when I tap on

103
00:07:42.370 --> 00:07:43.480
that Image view.

104
00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:46.960
So first let me try this.

105
00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:54.490
Let me run this in our simulator and then we're going to tap on the picture to see if we can see the

106
00:07:54.490 --> 00:07:58.590
tapped log in our logs.

107
00:07:58.630 --> 00:08:00.040
Here we go.

108
00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:05.020
So tap on James Hetfield and as you can see we see the tap logs here.

109
00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:09.930
So I can't just change the picture inside of my function.

110
00:08:10.150 --> 00:08:15.420
So let me close these down and come over here and you know how to change it right.

111
00:08:15.430 --> 00:08:23.770
That is the first thing that we have done in this course Image view that image UI image and it will

112
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:30.130
ask us for a name and they have the other options as well but where are you going to go for names.

113
00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:35.450
And we are going to say laughs because that's the name that we have saved here.

114
00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:39.890
So this will display the last when it's clicked.

115
00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:41.080
So that's good.

116
00:08:41.080 --> 00:08:46.060
I am going to change my labeled text to Lars Ulrich as well.

117
00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:48.720
So this is good.

118
00:08:48.730 --> 00:08:49.890
This is going to work.

119
00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:55.180
When I tap on the picture I will see the image going to Lars.

120
00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:55.740
Yes.

121
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:59.010
And the name is going to be Lars salary.

122
00:08:59.080 --> 00:09:07.210
So what I want next is when I click on this image view one more time it will revert back to James and

123
00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.400
I if I click one more time it will go back to Lars so back and forth back and forth.

124
00:09:12.670 --> 00:09:16.060
So I had to come up with that algorithm that does that.

125
00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:20.610
And in fact to you and you have all the information to do that.

126
00:09:20.610 --> 00:09:23.840
Right now you just have to be creative in the stage.

127
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.100
So I suggest you pose the video and try to do it on your own.

128
00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:29.240
Yeah.

129
00:09:29.260 --> 00:09:36.760
That can be done in various ways you can check to see if current label is less Larry and you can change

130
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:37.860
accordingly.

131
00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:41.710
But the classiest ways to do that is to create a billion.

132
00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:42.840
Okay.

133
00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:50.560
So I'm going to create a boolean in which I will define whether it's James right now or Lars.

134
00:09:50.710 --> 00:09:57.730
So my billion is going to be is James and this is initially going to be true because we start with James

135
00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:05.680
and I'm going to start by controlling if James is true if is James It's true that I'm going to do this

136
00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:13.420
I'm going to change the image view to be Lars okay and I'm going to change my label Tax that tax to

137
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:22.590
be Lars Hilary but if it's not true else I'm going to do the exact same thing in reverse order so I'm

138
00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:28.390
going to do James here and for tax I'm going to say James Hatfield.

139
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:31.310
So that's great right.

140
00:10:31.450 --> 00:10:35.200
And this won't even work because you will see why in a minute.

141
00:10:35.410 --> 00:10:37.930
So let me try this.

142
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:45.980
So if I click on this it will be Lars but if I click on this one more time it won't go back to James.

143
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:46.860
Why.

144
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:52.310
Maybe you think that you forgot to say is James false in here.

145
00:10:52.310 --> 00:10:53.110
And that's correct.

146
00:10:53.110 --> 00:10:55.550
The ad to say is James false in here.

147
00:10:55.690 --> 00:10:56.620
And actually we can't.

148
00:10:56.650 --> 00:11:04.120
We have to say he's James true in here as well in order to let the swift that has been changed but that's

149
00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:05.290
not the real problem.

150
00:11:05.290 --> 00:11:11.690
So if I click on this you will see that it will go to Lars.

151
00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.280
But again this won't go back to James.

152
00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.350
So why does this happen.

153
00:11:18.250 --> 00:11:26.450
If you go back to your coats you will see that we are starting with Barr is James e true.

154
00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:34.900
So when I start a function like this every time I click on this button it will create a variable called

155
00:11:34.990 --> 00:11:39.090
is James and it will assign this value to be true.

156
00:11:39.100 --> 00:11:48.790
So even though I later changed this to be false if I do it in like this it will just make is James e

157
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:52.240
true every time I click on that button.

158
00:11:52.570 --> 00:11:57.470
So this will be never executed as it warns me.

159
00:11:57.520 --> 00:12:03.720
So what I want to do I want to create this is James outside of this function.

160
00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:04.460
OK.

161
00:12:04.510 --> 00:12:12.370
I'm just going to initialize this in here so I can actually reach is James from we did load and I can

162
00:12:12.370 --> 00:12:21.870
actually reach is James from here as well right now in the change pic I can just change is James to

163
00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.510
falls and is James to true whenever I want.

164
00:12:25.510 --> 00:12:32.950
