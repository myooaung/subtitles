00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,130
Hi.

2
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:07,530
We didn't this lecture we're going to learn how to store data in the phone's memory.

3
00:00:08,130 --> 00:00:11,420
So far we have been collecting input from the user.

4
00:00:11,520 --> 00:00:18,750
For example users gave us some numbers in the calculator and we know how to get them right.

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,810
We then text feels or some other views but we don't know how to stored them.

6
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:30,720
What happens when a user closes the phone and what happens when they open it back.

7
00:00:30,750 --> 00:00:36,730
If we don't start the data in that small database then we would lose it.

8
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:43,800
So we're going to learn about a good technique so that we can actually save small information into small

9
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:49,580
database so that we can reach that value whenever we need it.

10
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,460
I'm going to create an X SCOPE project for that.

11
00:00:52,470 --> 00:00:57,460
I'm going to go for a single view app and we're going to build a bird.

12
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,980
They not take her.

13
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,210
Okay so I'm going to call this birthday note taker.

14
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:07,300
And again we're not going to use swift UI.

15
00:01:07,310 --> 00:01:09,030
We're going to go like this.

16
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:17,040
So hits next and places on your desktop or any folder you want.

17
00:01:17,070 --> 00:01:23,450
So in fact this app will let us only store one person's birthday as a note.

18
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:30,930
So this is not very useful because we're going to see how to Virg how to store in small amounts of data

19
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:31,940
right now.

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:41,400
Later on within the course we're going to see how to use large databases to save large datasets into

21
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:44,910
memory and then we can reach them whenever we want.

22
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:51,900
But right now we're going to learn a very practical technique so that we can start Data's and we can

23
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:54,750
just reach them whenever we want.

24
00:01:54,750 --> 00:02:02,790
For example we can store high score data tells us we can score other No user name information in order

25
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,770
to reach them.

26
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:11,720
When a user closes their app and opens them one more time so I'm done to keep it simple I'm going to

27
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:19,420
gonna ask for a name and a birthday so I'm going to have a save button over here and I'm going to leave.

28
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:28,020
I'm going to put two labels on the below so that I will show the storage information in those labels.

29
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:33,100
OK so it's gonna be simple maybe you can try to do that on your own as well.

30
00:02:33,880 --> 00:02:34,350
OK.

31
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:43,290
So two tacks feels button and the labels just do it and connect everything to the V controller dot Swift's

32
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:47,370
I hope you managed to do that.

33
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:49,240
So it's fairly easy right.

34
00:02:49,250 --> 00:02:51,560
We're going to use tax fuels.

35
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:56,920
So let me open the library and search for tax fields.

36
00:02:57,010 --> 00:03:03,460
We have worked with this before so I'm going to drag it and drop it over here and I'm going to make

37
00:03:03,460 --> 00:03:13,260
this a little bit bigger so maybe our friend has a long name or some think OK so let me go to attributes

38
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:16,380
inspector and give you the place holder.

39
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,390
So first we can ask for a name for example.

40
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,790
And I'm going to copy this with command C. And I'm going to pass this below with command V.

41
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:33,720
And you can do it from the library as vote but copying and pasting actually makes it very easy.

42
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:38,060
So in the place holder this time I'm going to go for birthday.

43
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:38,940
OK.

44
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:44,440
So birthday we ask for a name and we ask for the birthday.

45
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:50,590
Right now I'm just gonna add some bottom to save this information to our database.

46
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:53,500
So let me go and do this.

47
00:03:53,600 --> 00:03:54,320
OK.

48
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,600
By them.

49
00:03:55,710 --> 00:04:01,830
So let me name this button save and let me make this a little bit bigger.

50
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:03,350
So here you go.

51
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:04,690
Save.

52
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,170
And again we will have two labels in which we will display this stored data.

53
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,160
So search for label and put it over here.

54
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:15,510
OK.

55
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:21,610
And make does a little bit bigger and put it in the place center replace.

56
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:25,730
And yeah I believe that's good.

57
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:28,550
Maybe we can make this a little bit bigger.

58
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:29,790
Yeah.

59
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:36,570
So let me make this in line centrally and the far label I can go like this.

60
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:40,010
I can just say name column with a space.

61
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:42,350
I'm going to write naming here.

62
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:51,470
So let me copy and paste this and we're going to display the birthday in this label again by the way

63
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:56,630
of course we could have just displayed this chart labels sort tax in here as well.

64
00:04:56,630 --> 00:05:04,250
But I just want to display this in an obvious way so we don't lose track when we try to learn about

65
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:08,770
these saving into small database.

66
00:05:09,350 --> 00:05:10,650
So this is OK.

67
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:11,650
Right.

68
00:05:11,660 --> 00:05:13,970
We have what we need in here.

69
00:05:14,090 --> 00:05:23,090
We can just go ahead and try and connect every one of these buttons into buttons and other views into

70
00:05:23,090 --> 00:05:24,560
we control the dots.

71
00:05:24,590 --> 00:05:31,850
So here we have controller that swift in here and we already have mean that sorry Bert over here.

72
00:05:31,850 --> 00:05:40,130
So I'm gonna hit control on my keyboard and drag and drop to this class and I'm going to call these

73
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:41,750
name tax fields.

74
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:42,300
OK.

75
00:05:42,620 --> 00:05:49,990
I'm going to go and open some new lines over here and again do the same thing for a birthday.

76
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,540
So birthday tax fields.

77
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:54,540
OK.

78
00:05:54,620 --> 00:05:59,650
And we have to define our labels as well so let's go for a name label.

79
00:05:59,870 --> 00:06:00,710
OK.

80
00:06:00,770 --> 00:06:02,570
This is name label.

81
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:08,110
And lastly the BR they label will show birth the label.

82
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,930
I hope you managed to do that on your own by the way.

83
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:20,390
So let me just take this action by them and just save button clicked or save clicked.

84
00:06:20,480 --> 00:06:23,560
So this is OK we have connected everything.

85
00:06:24,380 --> 00:06:31,950
And before we forget let's add some constraints to here saying to reset to suggest constraints.

86
00:06:31,970 --> 00:06:34,900
So they will be in the right place.

87
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:40,760
And let's run this actually and see if everything seems to be in order.

88
00:06:40,850 --> 00:06:44,650
If not we can come back here and do some changes.

89
00:06:45,290 --> 00:06:51,220
It's always wise to do that before we go to we've controller that's first.

90
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:59,870
And again here in the save button that we want to do is actually we want to save this information into

91
00:06:59,870 --> 00:07:06,790
a very small database like structure but we don't know how to do that yet.

92
00:07:06,920 --> 00:07:13,580
Before we do that I'm just going to go and display this value using the name label on birthday label

93
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:16,670
anyway because we're going to do that later on.

94
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:17,380
Right.

95
00:07:17,390 --> 00:07:20,170
We're going to need it eventually.

96
00:07:20,330 --> 00:07:26,300
So it works fine by the way so we don't have to change anything with the view.

97
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:29,290
So let me tidy up here a little bit.

98
00:07:30,090 --> 00:07:30,980
OK.

99
00:07:31,190 --> 00:07:34,280
So I think we're good to go.

100
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:41,410
So how do I take name label and show the name text fields value over here.

101
00:07:41,420 --> 00:07:42,440
So yeah.

102
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:42,950
Correct.

103
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:44,680
Name labeled up taxed.

104
00:07:44,810 --> 00:07:47,380
Name text field dot text.

105
00:07:47,390 --> 00:07:53,340
So I'm taking the name text field out text and make it equal to name label dot text.

106
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:56,800
So we're going to do that for birthday labels right.

107
00:07:56,810 --> 00:07:58,720
You know how to do that.

108
00:07:59,060 --> 00:08:02,210
We have worked with this kind of thing before.

109
00:08:02,210 --> 00:08:05,310
So a birthday text field that text.

110
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:08,210
So all this app will do right now.

111
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,470
I will write something in the name and birthday text fields.

112
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:13,610
It will display them over here.

113
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,480
But again it started with name in our examples right.

114
00:08:17,780 --> 00:08:20,010
So how do I do that.

115
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,040
I don't want to just show the name tags feel.

116
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:31,660
I want to show it like this name column and the name text fields and if I come over here and if I tried

117
00:08:31,660 --> 00:08:38,510
to say something like this birthday text field text it doesn't work because it thinks that this is a

118
00:08:38,510 --> 00:08:45,920
string it is a text and this is in fact a text in order to treat this as a variable.

119
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:54,590
I have to use a spatial signed text in this quotation marks and in order to achieve this we are going

120
00:08:54,590 --> 00:08:58,250
to use a reverse slash in here.

121
00:08:58,280 --> 00:08:58,870
OK.

122
00:08:58,940 --> 00:09:03,010
And then open the parentheses and then close the parentheses.

123
00:09:03,020 --> 00:09:06,280
So between here I'm still writing a code.

124
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:08,990
I'm not writing any text.

125
00:09:09,030 --> 00:09:12,170
Actually I'm just writing my variable.

126
00:09:12,170 --> 00:09:19,910
So this will be displayed like name and the name text field that texts and again in here.

127
00:09:19,910 --> 00:09:24,280
So this will be birthday birthday text field text.

128
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:32,840
So you can use this reverse slash and then open and close parentheses think in order to use variables

129
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:35,700
inside of strings.

130
00:09:35,990 --> 00:09:43,100
So yeah we have to make this first our up and we're pretty certain that this text is going to give us

131
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:49,840
something because even if user doesn't give anything it will return an empty string.

132
00:09:49,840 --> 00:09:54,260
Not the values so this will be ok to force unwrap.

133
00:09:54,280 --> 00:10:00,570
Remember the optional as I remember the calculator team that we have built.

134
00:10:00,670 --> 00:10:06,280
And if you haven't bought those sections I suggest you go back and do that.

135
00:10:06,310 --> 00:10:11,840
So I believe we are ready to test and see if this works fine.

136
00:10:11,850 --> 00:10:21,190
OK let me open this in simulator run more time and let's see if we can get the values and display them

137
00:10:21,190 --> 00:10:24,010
in name label and birthday labels.

138
00:10:24,220 --> 00:10:31,450
So let's say Dave here and for his birthday I'm going to go for Jan 20.

139
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:41,440
And if I say save then I see both Jan 20 in the name and the birthday because I accidentally put birthday

140
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:48,790
tax field that taxed in here maybe you have realized my mistake when I was writing this code.

141
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:54,470
So maybe you already have corrected this so this should be named text field dot text.

142
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:04,900
So let me call this one more time and in fact you will see that this Dave and Jan 20 Van TV right.

143
00:11:04,900 --> 00:11:07,860
We cannot see them right now.

144
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:11,640
And I hit the save button I see this over here.

145
00:11:11,650 --> 00:11:18,610
But once user closes these down and opens it again this information will go away.

146
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:23,740
So how can we make certain that this information will stay here.

147
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:25,750
Yeah that's right.

148
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,960
We have to write this into a very small database like structure and that's what we have been trying

149
00:11:31,960 --> 00:11:37,030
to learn about and we're going to do that within the next lecture.
