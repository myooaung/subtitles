Hi.

2
00:00:01.420 --> 00:00:09.240
We didn't lecture regrowing to see how we can use Reiki UI kits so that we can create some really good

3
00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:09.990
designs.

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:12.560
We do using IRS kits.

5
00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:17.970
So if you come over here to file meaning as you can see there is an option saying that get UI kits.

6
00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.350
Now of course I'm gonna go for Apple Io s in this course.

7
00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.360
But you can use Google material as well so it provides us with some different icons different UI kids.

8
00:00:28.380 --> 00:00:32.610
It's a very good archive it's a very good hard tool.

9
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:33.960
It's a very good website.

10
00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:40.410
Actually you can just visit Google material that I know in order to see everything they got.

11
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:43.850
But right now I'm just going to go for this website.

12
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.920
So this is developer dot that pulled out come one more time.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:54.090
But right now we are in the design tab under resources so here they provide us with the resources that

14
00:00:54.090 --> 00:01:01.520
are commonly used in us so that we can get them and we can use them in our own designs as well.

15
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:10.270
For example you see the adobe Steve file over here and has some other sketch or Photoshop or keynote

16
00:01:10.770 --> 00:01:12.080
projects as well.

17
00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:14.200
But in fact we're going to go for it.

18
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:15.050
They'll be Steve.

19
00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:22.350
And as you can see they have some other UI kids for some other platforms as well like Mac also watch

20
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:24.010
AWS.

21
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:31.860
So right now I'm just going to discard this I'm just going to close this down because we're going to

22
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:34.840
use the downloaded UI kits.

23
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:39.160
So let me just bring this into my desktop so we can't see better.

24
00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:46.560
As you can see it's kind of a DMV file it's actually at the AMG file it's kind of an installation file

25
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:49.530
but actually we're not going to install anything.

26
00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:55.830
We're just going to open this up and we're just going to unzip them and I'm I will bring them into my

27
00:01:55.830 --> 00:01:57.670
desktop so we can use them.

28
00:01:57.680 --> 00:01:58.330
OK.

29
00:01:58.470 --> 00:02:01.220
So we can just delete this.

30
00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:05.230
We are done with that and I'm just going to inject this.

31
00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:06.690
So here you go.

32
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.100
Now let me open this up and let's see what we got over here.

33
00:02:11.100 --> 00:02:15.120
So for example we have this app icons IO Us.

34
00:02:15.210 --> 00:02:18.260
So if you double click on that it will provide a layout.

35
00:02:18.270 --> 00:02:22.710
It will provide a frame for you to design IRS icons.

36
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:23.310
OK.

37
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.700
So you can actually design your icons in this frame and you can use them later on in your project.

38
00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:36.190
And don't worry we're going to see how we can actually design some logo some icons in order to use in

39
00:02:36.210 --> 00:02:40.320
our apple IRS projects in the next lecture.

40
00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:48.270
But this is also a nice way it gives out pixels it gives out some frames so that we can create some

41
00:02:48.270 --> 00:02:52.080
good icons using that guidelines.

42
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:58.590
So that's one of them but actually it has much more to provide in this case.

43
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.480
And don't worry about this again.

44
00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:05.870
We're going to see how we can do do this in our own projects later on.

45
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:11.460
So let me close this down and let me go for something like tab borrower here I believe.

46
00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:18.930
So as you can see it provides us with some tab bar icons we can actually use those in our tab bar.

47
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:25.770
So we can just export them and use them in our own projects or we can edit them and use them one more

48
00:03:25.770 --> 00:03:26.940
time.

49
00:03:26.970 --> 00:03:32.720
So let me go for those guidelines and in the guides I'm going to go for iPhone.

50
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:37.890
IPhone X actually and you have some iPads or iPhone 8 as well.

51
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:45.320
So in the iPhone X and Steve file as you can see we have a lot of resources.

52
00:03:45.390 --> 00:03:50.610
So over here we see some color schemes we see some layouts.

53
00:03:50.610 --> 00:03:56.600
We see these menus like navigation virus like navigation buttons like this.

54
00:03:56.790 --> 00:03:57.750
OK.

55
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:09.280
So as you can see we see some color schemes like stars some buttons some titles some sliders and everything.

56
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:18.900
We see some UI elements we get some we use some menus and everything we see some error messages and

57
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:20.520
so much more.

58
00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:28.110
And the point here is that you can actually get these UI kits and you can easily use them in your Adobe

59
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.400
DB projects.

60
00:04:29.610 --> 00:04:35.990
Of course if you don't want to get anything out of these resources you're more than welcome to do so.

61
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.750
But in most of cases it's actually a good idea to come over here and just take some of these buttons

62
00:04:42.750 --> 00:04:50.670
take some of these views over here to using your own projects so it will be consistent with IRS guidelines.

63
00:04:50.670 --> 00:04:56.580
So we're going to stop here and we're going to see how we can create icons in the next lecture for our

64
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.630
own apps.
