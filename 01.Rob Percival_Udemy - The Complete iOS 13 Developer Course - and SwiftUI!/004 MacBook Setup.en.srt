00:00:00,770 --> 00:00:01,540
Hi.

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:05,610
Before we go on and learn about U.S. development.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:14,810
We have to make sure that we have necessary tools available in our Mac books in order to do that.

4
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:22,380
We are going to download something called X code from the Apple Developer Web site so that we can write

5
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:26,190
our codes inside of that software.

6
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:34,290
So you have to open a browser and go to this Web site developer that's Apple dot com.

7
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,920
So this is a fantastic Web site by Apple.

8
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:46,230
They let developers know the latest technologies latest developments latest available tools like X code

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,180
or other operating systems as well in this Web site.

10
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:57,750
And we can actually browse through this Web site to see the documentation how we can leverage the latest

11
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,130
technologies how we can use the latest news in our own apps.

12
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:08,010
But right now we're interested in this development tap.

13
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:14,220
And if you click on here you will see the latest technology is available for the developers.

14
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:15,440
OK.

15
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,960
And you can browse this in your own spare time.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,330
But right now you have to go to this download tab.

17
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:30,990
So if you click on this download tab it will bring you to a Web site in which you can download the necessary

18
00:01:30,990 --> 00:01:31,900
tools.

19
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:38,320
But first you have to give your Apple I.D. in order to reach those tools.

20
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:47,520
And this is a basic Apple I.D. So if you're using an iPhone or an iPad or a Macbook I I believe you

21
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:56,280
have one Apple I.D. If you don't have one you can create here to create yours and create your Apple

22
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,790
I.D. for free and you have to give your password and you have to love this.

23
00:02:01,800 --> 00:02:05,800
And then it will take you to this download section.

24
00:02:05,820 --> 00:02:06,100
OK.

25
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:11,650
So if you don't have an Apple I.D. yet please create one and sign in.

26
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:17,530
So in here you will see an operating systems tabs an application tab.

27
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:25,890
So not only we have the ability to reach the applications but also we see these operating systems here

28
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:26,400
as well.

29
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:35,230
So if you click on the applications you will see the x codes and in the operating systems we have like

30
00:02:35,250 --> 00:02:37,290
Mac US Catalina and others.

31
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:45,680
So in here we have two options one is beta and the other one is release release means it's open to public

32
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:53,340
now it means that we have completed the development phase and now the public is using it.

33
00:02:53,710 --> 00:03:01,290
But generally they provide the beta version to developers much earlier than the public because developers

34
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:10,080
might need to adjust their apps to upcoming features upcoming technologies for example every September

35
00:03:10,460 --> 00:03:13,830
ISIS launches a new version of the IRS.

36
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:14,360
Right.

37
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,720
Like all U.S. wildfire I 13 I years 14.

38
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,220
So they get we get these releases in September.

39
00:03:22,410 --> 00:03:30,990
So around like June or July we have to download the beta version of The X code to see how to implement

40
00:03:30,990 --> 00:03:38,130
the new technologies to our apps so that we will be ready when the release is there so that we can push

41
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:42,420
our new apps new version apps to the public.

42
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:47,950
So by the time I'm recording this X called eleven is in the beta.

43
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:50,640
So I'm going to download it from here.

44
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,690
If you see it in the release done it's going to be okay.

45
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:02,880
You will have to download it from the release tab then but I suggest you go for X Code eleven and beyond

46
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:11,370
X code 10 is the old news now because we have to be working with X Code eleven swift five and a U.S.

47
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:14,340
13 and upwards.

48
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:20,160
So I'm going to show you how to download this and how to is sold us.

49
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,750
And if you click on this download it will just start the download process and it's a little bit big.

50
00:04:26,760 --> 00:04:31,070
So it's kind of eight or seven point five gigabytes right now.

51
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:32,560
So it's going to take time.

52
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,620
So feel free to pause the video and come back after your download is finished.

53
00:04:37,620 --> 00:04:39,820
Of course I downloaded it before.

54
00:04:39,900 --> 00:04:44,160
In order not to make you wait but feel free to pause the video.

55
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:52,620
OK so after it's done what you have to do you have to come to your Downloads folder and you will see

56
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:53,820
something like this.

57
00:04:53,970 --> 00:05:02,500
So let me move this to trash so you will either see the zip or it will direct you to the App Store or

58
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,950
items connect.

59
00:05:04,030 --> 00:05:05,770
So I'm gonna show you both ways.

60
00:05:05,770 --> 00:05:14,440
Don't worry if you get the zip rather than App Store or ife ice I TOS then you just have to double click

61
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:20,210
on the zip and it will bring this exe code beta out in your folder.

62
00:05:20,220 --> 00:05:28,720
OK all you have to do then just take this EXCO beta and move it into your applications folder here.

63
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,100
So let me open my applications folder in another finder.

64
00:05:33,170 --> 00:05:41,860
OK so let me go to your applications and as you can see my ex code beta is already there so I'm not

65
00:05:41,860 --> 00:05:44,890
going to move it again but only add to this.

66
00:05:44,890 --> 00:05:51,700
Just move it then place it over there and then after you can just double click on this and I'll put

67
00:05:51,700 --> 00:05:53,920
it to use the x code beta.

68
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:55,810
We're going to see that in the next lecture.

69
00:05:55,810 --> 00:06:01,180
Don't worry as well and you can find it in your Launchpad as well.

70
00:06:01,220 --> 00:06:04,480
And I believe mine should be here.

71
00:06:04,480 --> 00:06:05,890
Yep it's here.

72
00:06:05,890 --> 00:06:10,080
I can open the ExCo beta from my Launchpad as well.

73
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:17,320
So what happens if you click on that download button and instead of starting downloading it brings you

74
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:25,480
at the App Store page like this then all you have to do is just click on this get and then install the

75
00:06:25,480 --> 00:06:26,390
app.

76
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:31,220
It will ask you for your password and this is the password for your macbook.

77
00:06:31,480 --> 00:06:34,920
Or you can just do a fingerprint scan as Vo.

78
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:39,420
It will start installing the X code for you after it completes.

79
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:46,690
You can find the X code in your applications folder or your Launchpad one more time so that's it.

80
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:53,710
That's all you had to do to install the X code but there are some questions there may be some questions

81
00:06:53,710 --> 00:07:02,050
in your mind regarding the operating systems as you can see I'm using Mac OS Catalina in my computer

82
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:03,020
right now.

83
00:07:03,040 --> 00:07:05,760
Do you have to install Mac OS Catalina.

84
00:07:05,860 --> 00:07:07,390
Not necessarily.

85
00:07:07,390 --> 00:07:12,710
You can use Mac OS mahogany or Catalina with X code eleven.

86
00:07:12,760 --> 00:07:18,970
Of course if you have a newer version you're more than welcome to use it as well but it has to be at

87
00:07:18,970 --> 00:07:20,640
least Mac OS more Harvey.

88
00:07:20,650 --> 00:07:30,010
OK so if you have an old mac book like you can not upgrade to MacOS Catalina or Mac or Somali then you

89
00:07:30,010 --> 00:07:35,870
will have to find an X code 10 version and use it instead of X code eleven.

90
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:44,530
But the latest one is X code eleven and there might be some changes in the codes like in the 94 95 percent

91
00:07:44,530 --> 00:07:45,300
of the time.

92
00:07:45,380 --> 00:07:46,900
There are still the same.

93
00:07:46,990 --> 00:07:55,420
But I suggest you upgrade to the latest version and if you encounter any problem using one of the old

94
00:07:55,420 --> 00:07:57,570
Mac books with X code 10.

95
00:07:57,730 --> 00:08:03,850
Just post your questions in the Korean a section and I will be more than happy to help you because I

96
00:08:03,850 --> 00:08:06,130
know all the older versions as well.

97
00:08:06,130 --> 00:08:07,810
Don't worry about that.

98
00:08:08,230 --> 00:08:14,410
And at the near of the end of this course we're going to learn something called SWIFT UI and it actually

99
00:08:14,410 --> 00:08:16,470
requires MacOS Catalina.

100
00:08:16,810 --> 00:08:24,100
So if you're waiting for to upgrade to make us Catalina I suggest you do that with X code eleven so

101
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:27,460
that you will have a complete set up to start with.

102
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:28,670
So that's it.

103
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:34,480
If you're done by now let's stop here and within the next lecture we are going to discuss how to create

104
00:08:34,480 --> 00:08:36,670
our first X code projects.
