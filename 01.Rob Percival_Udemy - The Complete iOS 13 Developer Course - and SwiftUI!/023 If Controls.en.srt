00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:01,050
Hi.

2
00:00:01,200 --> 00:00:09,120
We didn't this lecture regrowing to see what our if controls so we're going to control some condition.

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:12,600
Okay we're going to see if a condition holds or not.

4
00:00:12,600 --> 00:00:17,180
And we are going to define what to do if it holds or if it doesn't hold.

5
00:00:17,430 --> 00:00:19,850
So let me create the new playground.

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,290
I'm going to name this if controls OK.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:30,880
And let me put it in my playgrounds folder over here so that I can share it with you guys later.

8
00:00:31,620 --> 00:00:38,430
So let me start by deleting this automatically generate a line and we're going to start by creating

9
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,570
our own variable to work upon.

10
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:43,180
So we're gonna go like this.

11
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:51,360
We're going to create an integer and we're going to control to see if it is under some certain level

12
00:00:51,450 --> 00:00:55,620
or if it is below or abot some certain level.

13
00:00:55,790 --> 00:00:56,790
Okay.

14
00:00:56,850 --> 00:00:57,750
What do I mean.

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:00:59,220
Let me just do it.

16
00:00:59,220 --> 00:01:10,290
So why my age 32 and I'm going to check to see if my age is actually less than 30 or more than 30.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,900
So we use the keywords if and it's fairly easy.

18
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,700
You just write it like this.

19
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,620
If my age is less than 30 then do this.

20
00:01:23,640 --> 00:01:24,570
OK.

21
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:34,720
So like print 30 minus me if I run this you will see that this doesn't print anything.

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,820
Because whatever you write inside of this code block will get room.

23
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:43,210
If only this condition holds.

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,990
Right now as you can see my age is not less than 30 my age is 32.

25
00:01:49,950 --> 00:01:52,790
And so we're not doing anything.

26
00:01:52,790 --> 00:01:53,940
We're not printing up.

27
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:59,910
We're not executing the code like in the while loop or in the for loop.

28
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,870
What happens if the condition doesn't hold.

29
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,710
We got out of the loop right.

30
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:06,480
So this is the same thing.

31
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:12,450
So if I print something in here for example you will see it on the logs.

32
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:12,780
OK.

33
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:21,960
It doesn't affect anything beside itself but if I write something inside of my code block it will only

34
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:26,420
get executed if the condition holds.

35
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,110
So this is great right.

36
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:36,540
It gives us the power to run codes whenever we want when a condition holds one some number exceeds something

37
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,830
when I don't know when the time runs out.

38
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:41,730
OK.

39
00:02:41,820 --> 00:02:48,170
So we can check to see these conditions and they can't say else.

40
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,170
OK.

41
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:54,250
If you say Ellis and I'll put a new curly braces you can't say it.

42
00:02:54,270 --> 00:02:58,580
What do you want to happen if this condition doesn't hold.

43
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:03,240
For example you can say 30 plus.

44
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:10,920
And as you can see we will see the turn a pause in the logs as you can see it's here because my age

45
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,900
is now turning to this didn't hold.

46
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:22,240
And since I have given an L statement it's printed out the statement it got executed the end state.

47
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,780
And in fact this isn't the only way to go with the F controls as well.

48
00:03:28,890 --> 00:03:34,530
We can have as many as control points in an if statement.

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:39,540
I can check for if my age is 32 e my age is 33.

50
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:50,220
If my age is 34 OK and to do that rather than saying LS I'm going to say else if.

51
00:03:51,060 --> 00:04:03,060
So if my age is less than 30 print this but if my age is not less than 30 hours if my age is actually

52
00:04:03,060 --> 00:04:04,530
greater than 30.

53
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:14,190
But also we can use a combined statement in here like N and or or operation.

54
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:16,850
So what do I mean by that.

55
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:21,400
I can go and do something like this with double ends.

56
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,150
I can just add one more statements.

57
00:04:25,380 --> 00:04:30,110
So let me tell you about this a little bit so we can continue.

58
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:38,370
So we have less than greater than and we have seen the equal or not equal.

59
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,040
OK.

60
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,190
We have even seen less than an equal to greater than equal to.

61
00:04:43,200 --> 00:04:51,330
But we haven't seen and and ah so how do we use an or in an.

62
00:04:51,360 --> 00:05:03,410
And operator we say dad both conditions must hold OK and in or operate tears we say dad one of the conditions

63
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,860
must hold.

64
00:05:04,860 --> 00:05:14,540
And in order to do this or operators sign you have to press option or alter in your keyboard with the

65
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,170
dash.

66
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:25,210
So this is piping by the way a pipe sign double pipe double and so double pipe stands for R and double

67
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:26,180
lines stands for.

68
00:05:26,210 --> 00:05:38,000
And so in an ends situation you just control to see if both of the conditions hold like as if my age

69
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:39,550
is greater than 30.

70
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:46,630
And as if my age is actually less than 35 or something.

71
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:55,100
So this doesn't make sense right now because my age is greater than 30 and it should be 40 then I can

72
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:56,960
breed something like it's like.

73
00:05:56,960 --> 00:05:58,430
I mean the 30s.

74
00:05:58,430 --> 00:06:04,860
Okay so else now I can't say that I was else means right now.

75
00:06:04,910 --> 00:06:15,740
If this condition doesn't hold okay and if these conditions do not hold as though then come back to

76
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,170
do whatever I write in the else.

77
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:27,740
If these conditions hold it will do what it that we told the if statement to do an ls it will print

78
00:06:27,740 --> 00:06:31,640
out 40 plus for example.

79
00:06:31,730 --> 00:06:33,670
Let's try this a little bit.

80
00:06:33,710 --> 00:06:38,010
Let's run this and we will see turkeys because our age is thirty two.

81
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:38,980
OK.

82
00:06:39,320 --> 00:06:42,820
And let me change the value and test is more so.

83
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:49,220
Let me do this something like forty five if I run this I will see 40 plus.

84
00:06:49,220 --> 00:06:52,420
Right here you go we see the 40 plus.

85
00:06:52,430 --> 00:06:55,520
So over algorithm does work.

86
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:05,780
And if I do something like ls if the age is between 40 and 50 50 and 60 I can add as many as I want.

87
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:11,420
Like as if my age is between 40 and my age is less than 50.

88
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:19,730
OK so I can do some I'll say again and I can print out 50 plus if I want.

89
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:28,740
Now if I run this rather than saying yeah I will say again for the plus because we're in the forty five.

90
00:07:28,790 --> 00:07:29,510
One more time.

91
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:34,100
So let me do this something like ninety eight will say 50 plus.

92
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,740
OK here you go.

93
00:07:37,110 --> 00:07:45,120
So we can check to see if a condition holds with if controls on we can say whatever we want to do if

94
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:46,350
that condition holds.

95
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:52,500
So this is actually great things to learn in programming languages.

96
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:59,840
So let me talk a little bit about this and or operator in a little bit more detail.

97
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:04,620
So if I say something like this tree's less than 5 which will give me true.

98
00:08:04,620 --> 00:08:05,700
Right.

99
00:08:05,700 --> 00:08:16,320
But if I add some and operator and if I say five is less than seven if I run this it will give me true

100
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:16,730
again.

101
00:08:16,890 --> 00:08:17,980
Because why.

102
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,290
Because both sides of the condition holds.

103
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:27,360
So tree is actually less than five and five is actually less than seven.

104
00:08:27,450 --> 00:08:36,540
But if I change one of this and if any of this doesn't hold it won't give me true because and means

105
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,360
both side of this equation is true.

106
00:08:39,370 --> 00:08:44,390
OK so if I do it like this eight is less than seven.

107
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:51,230
This won't give me true even though tree is less than five because this is Ms.

108
00:08:51,660 --> 00:09:00,600
And the logic brings us this if I want to use it in a way that if one of the conditions hold give me

109
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:10,900
true anyway then I have to use or K not and I can just say tree is less than five.

110
00:09:10,930 --> 00:09:11,330
Okay.

111
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:20,730
For example this is ends and this is or so in here let me do something like this tree is less than five

112
00:09:21,030 --> 00:09:28,070
or Okay double pipes eight is actually less than seven.

113
00:09:28,170 --> 00:09:31,230
So this will give me true because why.

114
00:09:31,230 --> 00:09:36,900
Because we didn't say and this side of the condition holds the other side doesn't hold.

115
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:42,570
But it doesn't matter for us because we used or in this case.

116
00:09:42,570 --> 00:09:51,780
So you can use and operations and or operators in your if controls if statements to check and see if

117
00:09:51,780 --> 00:09:59,190
a condition holds if you want both sides of the equation true you must use and if you just want one

118
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:07,800
side then you should go with R so do v use if statements with numbers are integers only of course not.

119
00:10:07,800 --> 00:10:10,050
We can use it with strings as well.

120
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:17,400
For example let me create a string called James I can check to see if my string is actually James or

121
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:17,820
not.

122
00:10:17,850 --> 00:10:27,140
So let me open my curly braces and I will just print out something like two ok and or yes.

123
00:10:28,050 --> 00:10:36,270
So as you can see we see the s if I change some letter or here rather than making this capitalized if

124
00:10:36,270 --> 00:10:43,980
I make this lower case it won't say yes because it has to be exactly the same in order these two strings

125
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,800
to be equal.

126
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:55,110
OK so we can use if statements with strings with billions with numbers whatever we want we are going

127
00:10:55,110 --> 00:11:02,070
to use if if statements most of the apps that we were going to build obviously and we will practice

128
00:11:02,070 --> 00:11:03,780
them much more later on.

129
00:11:04,380 --> 00:11:11,670
So right now we're going to stop here and within the next lecture we're going to continue with the functions.
