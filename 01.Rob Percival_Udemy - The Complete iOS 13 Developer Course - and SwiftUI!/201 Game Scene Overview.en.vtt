00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi.

2
00:00:01.530 --> 00:00:02.940
We didn't this lecture.

3
00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.990
Where are you going to deep dive into a game scene that is chaos.

4
00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:11.560
So far we have seen that this is our frame and this is very design our game.

5
00:00:11.840 --> 00:00:19.840
And as you can see we have this hell over a label inside of this and we don't have anything else.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:27.210
So what we can do over here for example we can't change the background color from here right.

7
00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:28.910
We can do this white.

8
00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:36.540
If I do this White I believe we cannot see anything in here so I'm going to go for another color like

9
00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:41.960
black or you can't try something like blue or green or red.

10
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:49.790
In order to see it's better we're going to change the background to a picture to an image anyway.

11
00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:56.550
So you're more than welcome to choose whatever you want from here for right now to see it better.

12
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:02.530
I believe you will see my screen better if I do it like this with a black or gray.

13
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:06.350
So we're going to work with this color.

14
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:13.410
And in here you see the frame and actually you're not going to be using this with that portrayed mode.

15
00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:21.240
So I believe we should change this in this design section as well so that we will design our app with

16
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.160
a landscape mode.

17
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:30.270
So in the right hand side you see the width is 750 and height is charting 44.

18
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:35.590
So I'm going to reverse this to be thirteen forty four and seven fifty.

19
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:38.950
And as he can see now my frame is reversed says vote.

20
00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:42.980
So I have a landscape frame to work on.

21
00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:50.250
So I'm going to choose this hallowed label and I'm going to delete it by pressing backspace or delete

22
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.990
on my keyboard.

23
00:01:51.990 --> 00:02:00.240
And if you open your library you will see you have a lot of different options than you used to like.

24
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.750
We don't have labels we don't have buttons we don't have text fields over here but we have something

25
00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:15.680
called sprites and we have other objects as well but we generally work with sprites in the sprite kids.

26
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:22.810
So sprite is some object some view that you can change its background to an image or a color.

27
00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:29.190
So we're going to use sprites a lot during this section and you you will know what I mean.

28
00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:32.030
Don't worry about right now.

29
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:38.840
Before we go on and work with sprites we have to understand game scene comprehensively.

30
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:44.290
For example we have some anchor points over here and this is the anchor point.

31
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:49.530
So it defines the 0 0 coordinates in my system.

32
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.210
So remember in the layout section we define some views with code.

33
00:02:54.210 --> 00:03:02.460
So we defined some label for example when it asked for some size and some position to put that label

34
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:04.680
in our view controller right.

35
00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:07.500
So this is what we're going to do in this section as well.

36
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:09.610
We were going to create sprites.

37
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:17.340
So it will ask us for some size and some position to put that view into our scene.

38
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:21.960
So if we say 0 0 it will put it on our anchor.

39
00:03:21.970 --> 00:03:27.660
And as you can see we can actually change the anchor point using this pain.

40
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:36.870
So if I say 0 0 it means that it will put my anchor points in the left hand side on the bottom.

41
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.520
So this is my y axis and this is my x axis as you know and it defines the 0 0.

42
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:49.250
And if you have worked with Sprite kid before this was the default anchor point.

43
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:51.670
So this was the 0 0.

44
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:59.860
But right now we get it in 0 point 5 0 point 5 which refers to the middle of the scene.

45
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:10.500
So when we say x 0 y 0 in the code it will place our values inside of the middle of the screen right

46
00:04:10.590 --> 00:04:11.740
now.

47
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:18.900
So this is kind of a choice that you want to make if you want to put your views into into the middle

48
00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:19.640
of the screen.

49
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:26.400
When you say 0 0 to the x axis and y axis now you can use anchor point like this.

50
00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:33.030
If you don't like this if you're meant to magical person that you may want to put everything in the

51
00:04:33.030 --> 00:04:41.450
0 0 axis then you say 0 0 in the positions in the coordinates then you are more than welcome to change

52
00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:42.980
this anchor point.

53
00:04:43.230 --> 00:04:51.090
But if you're not very experienced with Sprite kids or somewhat medical operations I believe you watch

54
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:55.850
me I'm going to use this as 0 point five four point five.

55
00:04:55.890 --> 00:04:59.420
You will know what to do with 0 point 5.

56
00:04:59.430 --> 00:05:00.390
Anchor Points.

57
00:05:00.530 --> 00:05:01.400
And if you want.

58
00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:03.920
You can just change them later on.

59
00:05:04.070 --> 00:05:09.470
And as you can see we have a gravity over here which is a minus nine point eight.

60
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:15.980
So this represents literally the gravity because we're going to have a physical world working with Sprite

61
00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.540
kids.

62
00:05:16.580 --> 00:05:23.660
We're going to use it later on you will understand what I mean right now as you can see this checkboxes

63
00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:28.340
define what we're seeing in the preview or rough we're not seeing.

64
00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:31.190
So I'm going to keep all of this things checked.

65
00:05:31.220 --> 00:05:33.410
So I want to see the camera boundaries.

66
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:36.530
So I want to see the physics boundaries and everything.

67
00:05:36.770 --> 00:05:39.450
So this is only related to preview.

68
00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:44.390
This is not related to the app itself or game itself.

69
00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:51.620
So I believe we are ready to go over here and uncheck this part traits because we're only going to use

70
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:55.550
this in landscape right or the landscape left modes.

71
00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.740
And this is not actually enough.

72
00:05:57.740 --> 00:06:04.220
So you have to go to the info that P lists and as you can see we have some supported interface orientations

73
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:09.830
and we have some interface orientations for IPD as well.

74
00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:17.180
So if you're developing your game to use it in AI pads as well you have to make sure you delete this

75
00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:19.140
portrayed much from here.

76
00:06:19.190 --> 00:06:24.100
So in our case I believe IPD is checked and I want to keep it that way.

77
00:06:24.350 --> 00:06:32.030
But in order to keep this you have to come down over here and choose this portrait and hit on this minus

78
00:06:32.030 --> 00:06:39.810
button to delete the portrayed modes so that our app will only support landscape mode.

79
00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:42.780
So here we are ready to use the game see.

80
00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.660
Now we have our anchor point.

81
00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:50.180
We have our landscape orientation in design and in the real app as well.

82
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:57.200
Now we are ready to go and bring in the first design in our game scene so that we can start working

83
00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.150
on our angry birds clone.
