Hi.

2
00:00:01,300 --> 00:00:04,610
We didn't does lecture regrowing to learn about breakpoints.

3
00:00:04,970 --> 00:00:11,060
So breakpoints are literally the points that we want to take a break from running the code.

4
00:00:11,690 --> 00:00:19,850
So it's spelled like this and I'm going to show you a showcase and in here I believe we have to comment

5
00:00:19,850 --> 00:00:25,660
on the sprints so that we worlds have a clear lock cat over here.

6
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:26,020
OK.

7
00:00:26,060 --> 00:00:28,500
So let me comment on this as well.

8
00:00:28,610 --> 00:00:33,470
And let me come over here to have a very simple example.

9
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:40,020
And this gives me an error because we have to have some statement in this switching case.

10
00:00:40,070 --> 00:00:43,610
So let me live this as it is.

11
00:00:43,730 --> 00:00:44,710
We will see this.

12
00:00:44,720 --> 00:00:47,770
It's one two three thing but it won't matter.

13
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,540
For example I'm going to create a variable over here.

14
00:00:51,620 --> 00:00:52,510
OK.

15
00:00:52,550 --> 00:01:00,380
And I'm going to assign this to be a number and then later on I'm going to change this number and I'm

16
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:04,490
going to try to figure out that I am changing this number.

17
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,810
So let me say that.

18
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:13,550
Let x is five and let's make it variable rather than constant because we're going to change it.

19
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:20,900
And let's bring it up does X and then later on I'm going to add the wanted as X and printouts one more

20
00:01:20,900 --> 00:01:29,720
time for example let's suppose that I have a very complex code in my project and I'm trying to put the

21
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,420
value of x in a label.

22
00:01:32,810 --> 00:01:36,980
So it prints out six as it's supposed to.

23
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:40,300
As you can see it prints out five and then six.

24
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:47,900
And because it's really six but for some reason suppose that I cannot figure out why it's printing out

25
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:51,860
six or why it's showing six in the labels.

26
00:01:51,860 --> 00:01:56,930
So I'm trying to find that I'm adding one to this.

27
00:01:56,930 --> 00:02:03,040
For example if I click over here in the line 158.

28
00:02:03,050 --> 00:02:07,280
Now when I run this it will stop my code.

29
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:15,860
It will stop executing my code at the break point like I have crashed the application of course it's

30
00:02:15,860 --> 00:02:23,150
not a crash it's just a breakpoint and it will give me a perch unity to debug this code.

31
00:02:23,660 --> 00:02:31,700
And as you can see now we see all the variables all the objects that we have created in this file and

32
00:02:31,700 --> 00:02:38,270
also we see the values we see the current values that are assigned to those variables.

33
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:43,590
So this is a very good very comprehensive information to debug.

34
00:02:44,030 --> 00:02:49,980
Now I can just see that my ex is 5 for example.

35
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:59,850
So I know before line 1 Von 58 I believe Yep before line 58 158.

36
00:02:59,930 --> 00:03:00,970
It was okay.

37
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:02,730
It was still five.

38
00:03:03,260 --> 00:03:11,900
Now if I come over here to 159 and I can just drag this and drop over here to delete it and if I run

39
00:03:11,930 --> 00:03:21,730
this one more time then I will see old values one more time and now I see my ex is six.

40
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:29,860
Now I can know that I know that before line 1 58 it was 5.

41
00:03:29,870 --> 00:03:34,150
Now I'm having this issue in line 158.

42
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:40,850
Of course this is too obvious and you cannot understand the importance of this but in a very complex

43
00:03:40,850 --> 00:03:50,540
code you would find this very helpful to stop the code and see all the values assigned to all the variables

44
00:03:50,870 --> 00:03:56,480
because maybe you're not looking for a single value maybe you're looking for a data that you download

45
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,760
from the Internet or maybe you're looking for a very complex set of areas.

46
00:04:01,790 --> 00:04:02,330
OK.

47
00:04:02,930 --> 00:04:10,940
So either case this will be very helpful when you try to debug your code and begin there is actually

48
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:16,820
by accident tap on these lines and they add breakpoints and they don't know how to delete them.

49
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,860
So you can beat them by dragging them out of your code.

50
00:04:20,990 --> 00:04:21,950
So that's it.

51
00:04:21,950 --> 00:04:25,580
Let's stop here and continue within the next section.
