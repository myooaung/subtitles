00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.970
Hi.

2
00:00:01.300 --> 00:00:02.450
We did this lecture.

3
00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:07.160
We're going to take care of our upload functionality first of all.

4
00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:14.640
We're going to do it in a basic way so that we will display the uploaded image in the feed we've controller.

5
00:00:15.100 --> 00:00:22.350
OK but later on we are going to change our algorithm so that we can display all the pictures grouped

6
00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:31.890
in one post so that every snap owner has only one post so that we can consolidate all the snaps and

7
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.340
display them in an image slider within another view controller.

8
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:38.330
OK.

9
00:00:38.730 --> 00:00:41.640
So first of all we are going to do the basic way.

10
00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.760
However we're going to upload our images to the storage eventually.

11
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.120
So first we going to write that function.

12
00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:55.590
And you know how this goes we're going to create a storage instance.

13
00:00:55.590 --> 00:01:02.010
And are we going to upload everything to the storage and get the respective your URL so that we can

14
00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:03.370
work on that your URL.

15
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.710
OK.

16
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:08.400
So in fact we can start to create our storage area for us.

17
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:15.450
So this will drive from storage and we have to import the firebase in order to do that.

18
00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:15.820
OK.

19
00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:22.610
So let me import defy your base and then come down here then I can call this storage.

20
00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:24.030
That's storage.

21
00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.700
So this is my storage instance.

22
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.610
And remember I have to create a storage reverse right.

23
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.190
So this will be storage.

24
00:01:32.190 --> 00:01:35.540
That reference now using data for us.

25
00:01:35.540 --> 00:01:43.230
I can't specify the folder that I'm working in so this will be storage referenced dot child.

26
00:01:43.230 --> 00:01:48.300
Remember we have to give a name over here to specify the folder name.

27
00:01:48.300 --> 00:01:54.050
So we will be saving our pictures inside of a folder called media.

28
00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:54.450
OK.

29
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:56.400
So you can choose this name.

30
00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:59.420
You can call it images you can call it media.

31
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:06.200
You can call it storage whatever you want but you have to have a folder in order to be more structure.

32
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.130
OK.

33
00:02:07.170 --> 00:02:10.170
Later on I'm going to create my data.

34
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:14.630
Remember we have to convert our image to a data in order to upload it.

35
00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:18.600
And this will be Jay Peak data and the compression quality.

36
00:02:18.690 --> 00:02:20.580
I'm going to go with 0 point 5.

37
00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:25.850
So I'm going to use this data to save in my media folder.

38
00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.200
So how do we do it.

39
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:35.010
We're going to do it exactly like we did in the Instagram clone section first of all we have to give

40
00:02:35.010 --> 00:02:39.870
it a name and this name will be coming from you you I.D..

41
00:02:39.870 --> 00:02:42.710
Remember when we say you you I.D. string.

42
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.060
So let me delete this and you can see it better.

43
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.460
It will give us and made up a string like that every going to use it as a name for our images so that

44
00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.240
we will have a unique name every time we upload an image.

45
00:02:57.870 --> 00:03:05.480
So I'm going to call this imagery for us and this will be again drive from media folder.

46
00:03:05.490 --> 00:03:06.080
Ok.

47
00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.480
Media folder dot child and the name will be the you you IDG pack.

48
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:15.950
So we have to go like this you you I.D..

49
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:25.680
And we have to specify Of course this quotation marks and say J pack so that it won't be uploaded as

50
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.590
a veered file it will be uploaded as a j peg file later on you can just say image reference that's put

51
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:42.870
data and it will ask you for a data and then meta data and in return it will give you a completion block.

52
00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:43.790
OK.

53
00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:44.810
So we want.

54
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:53.810
We don't want that but we want this upload data meta data and the completion block so data will be data.

55
00:03:53.820 --> 00:04:01.620
I don't need any meta data to upload to the server but in completion I'm going to get a major data and

56
00:04:01.950 --> 00:04:03.050
an error.

57
00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.110
So of course I'm going to start to check if error is not nil and if it area's not there I'm just going

58
00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:13.010
to display an error message to the user.

59
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:19.560
So I believe we don't have this make a left function so I'm going to copy it from other controllers

60
00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:27.690
and paste it over here so that I can call s that's make Eliot and call this error and the message will

61
00:04:27.690 --> 00:04:30.480
be error dot localized description.

62
00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:34.110
And if this is nailed down I'm going to call something like error.

63
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:35.760
OK.

64
00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:41.160
And else and else I'm going to take the image you're out.

65
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.270
So remember you have to say image reference that download the url.

66
00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:49.030
So this will give you either a new URL or an error.

67
00:04:49.110 --> 00:04:56.910
And this time you can just go for if error is nil and go for the URL over here.

68
00:04:56.910 --> 00:05:04.330
So let me close this down so we can see whether in this case I'm just going to create my image your

69
00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:09.180
url and it will be something like your URL that's absolute string.

70
00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:10.440
This is not absolute.

71
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:12.150
Your URL absolute string.

72
00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.330
OK.

73
00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:21.630
So later on in fact we are going to save this image here along with the other parameters that we want

74
00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.250
to defy your star.

75
00:05:23.850 --> 00:05:27.290
So first I'm going to create my file your story instance.

76
00:05:27.290 --> 00:05:34.080
So this will be far your story not far your store that I can come over here and decide where to save

77
00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:41.820
it something like fire store data collection and I'm going to call the snaps again I'm going to add

78
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:42.650
a document.

79
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:50.870
It will ask me for a dictionary and a completion block it will give me a completion block actual so

80
00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:56.300
you can choose this one and you can create your snap dictionary over here.

81
00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.260
So what will be in our snap dictionary.

82
00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:06.140
First we have to specify the image you arrow and the user name of the user.

83
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:12.370
And along with those I'm going to go for a date as well so that we can delete them.

84
00:06:12.380 --> 00:06:14.300
Then 24 hours is passed.

85
00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:16.860
So let's go for image URL.

86
00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:18.340
An image url.

87
00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:24.020
So I'm first unwrapping this so if you want you can use a flat in order to be more secure.

88
00:06:24.470 --> 00:06:25.700
OK.

89
00:06:25.760 --> 00:06:30.710
And I'm going to call my user name snap owner.

90
00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:31.190
OK.

91
00:06:31.220 --> 00:06:33.340
So this will be the snap owner.

92
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:40.450
I remember we can get the user name from user Singleton that shared user info dot user name.

93
00:06:41.330 --> 00:06:44.090
So that's how we use singletons.

94
00:06:44.090 --> 00:06:48.200
And over here I'm going to specify the date as well.

95
00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:55.760
Again in order to order everything by date or in order to just delete them after 24 hours.

96
00:06:55.760 --> 00:07:03.560
So remember how we got date in Instagram clone field value dot server time stamp.

97
00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:11.090
So I'm gonna cast as a string to any dictionary so that I can come over here and say snap dictionary

98
00:07:11.750 --> 00:07:15.550
and if I hit enter over here it will give me an error.

99
00:07:15.770 --> 00:07:20.630
So you can check to see if areas not nil or if if error is nil.

100
00:07:20.630 --> 00:07:25.700
So if is not nil it's your call to display an error message to the user.

101
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:27.490
I'm going to do it.

102
00:07:27.610 --> 00:07:28.510
Ants.

103
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:31.160
Let's say a double question mark.

104
00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:31.610
Error.

105
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:39.530
And if that's the case then what we want to go to what we want is to go to feed we have controller and

106
00:07:39.770 --> 00:07:41.270
reset this view.

107
00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:46.460
But just let me tests to see if it's working or not.

108
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:49.600
We're going to need two images anyway.

109
00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:57.380
So let me upload the first one so I'm going to say upload and I want to know if this is uploaded or

110
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:02.940
not because I didn't specify like going to feed the view controller or something.

111
00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:04.340
So let me do it anyway.

112
00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:05.830
You're going to do it eventually.

113
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:08.890
So I'm going to say self dots.

114
00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:15.350
Remember we're working with a tab bar controller over here so I can just say South tab bar controller

115
00:08:15.350 --> 00:08:17.840
dot selected index is zero.

116
00:08:17.870 --> 00:08:20.970
It's going to take us to the feed we have controller.

117
00:08:21.290 --> 00:08:28.490
And of course I'm going to change the upload image view image as well to its original image which is

118
00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:30.480
our select image.

119
00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:33.590
So let's say select image.

120
00:08:33.980 --> 00:08:38.260
So let's see if this was select image or select.

121
00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:46.010
Yep it's select image so you can come over here as a select image that PSG and let me run it one more

122
00:08:46.010 --> 00:08:46.600
time.

123
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:52.650
We're going to need two images anyway because I'm going to show you something.

124
00:08:52.760 --> 00:09:02.170
So let me open this OK and let me come over to my upload and upload another picture over here.

125
00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:04.900
So let's choose this and say upload.

126
00:09:05.090 --> 00:09:10.760
Once we hit that it will get uploaded to the server and it will take us to the feed we have controller.

127
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.890
So let's go back to our five star so you fire refresh does.

128
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:18.120
Then we are going to see the steps.

129
00:09:18.140 --> 00:09:19.230
All right.

130
00:09:19.340 --> 00:09:21.170
So let's see.

131
00:09:21.170 --> 00:09:21.860
Here you go.

132
00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:24.020
Now we have the snap collection.

133
00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:27.620
And as you can see we have two documents over here.

134
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:34.310
So we have the snap over there of James Hetfield and we have the image you're line everything so far

135
00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:38.360
this is working good but in fact we don't want that.

136
00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:39.220
Right.

137
00:09:39.260 --> 00:09:42.980
What we want is to have one single document.

138
00:09:43.250 --> 00:09:50.880
So if you can adjust Pate paste is your url to your browser you will see that this is in fact working.

139
00:09:51.050 --> 00:09:51.940
OK.

140
00:09:51.950 --> 00:10:00.650
And I have no objection to that but I don't want to do documents for only one snap owner because remember

141
00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:08.000
our prototype then we have seen the Snapchat clone in the first lecture of the section.

142
00:10:08.120 --> 00:10:14.960
We have consolidated every snap of one user to one post that.

143
00:10:15.180 --> 00:10:20.950
That means we have to get every step inside of only one document.

144
00:10:20.990 --> 00:10:23.500
So how can we do that.

145
00:10:23.540 --> 00:10:28.000
I will show you a way to do that but it's only my way.

146
00:10:28.010 --> 00:10:36.470
You can't come up with a better one later on actually but you will see how to work with arrays inside

147
00:10:36.470 --> 00:10:39.560
of the collection inside of a document as well.

148
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:40.100
Right.

149
00:10:40.310 --> 00:10:46.370
So let's stop here within the next like we're going to do that and we're going to see these advanced

150
00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:47.970
usages of fire sir.

151
00:10:48.290 --> 00:10:53.340
And then we will complete our by retrieving all data to show them in Ft.
