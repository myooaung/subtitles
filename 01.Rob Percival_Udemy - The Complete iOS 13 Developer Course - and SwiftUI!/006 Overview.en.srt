1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,180
Hi.

2
00:00:01,470 --> 00:00:08,160
Welcome to The X code within this lecture regarding to see the overview of the X codes.

3
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:16,110
For example we're going to see what does this left brain do or what does this right pain do.

4
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:24,990
And if you don't see the space over here the left little windows over here you can just go to this button

5
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,770
and if you click on this you will see it will hide or show the left pain and the right pain.

6
00:00:32,060 --> 00:00:32,460
Okay.

7
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:41,670
So if you don't see any of these windows over here you can always come and show and hide over this bottom.

8
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:50,520
So these are generally the helper pays in the left pane we see the files and folders on in the right

9
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:54,580
pane we journalists see these options and attributes I'm going to show you.

10
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:55,740
What are they.

11
00:00:55,740 --> 00:00:56,860
Don't worry.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,230
And in here we have the files and folders.

13
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:03,090
So let's start with the first one.

14
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:07,740
If you click on the top you will see this general settings page.

15
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:08,630
Okay.

16
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:13,530
This is where we do the general settings of our app like display data.

17
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:23,370
So whatever I write here it will appear when I actually upload my app to the App Store and then somebody

18
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:27,720
downloads it it will see this name on their iPhone.

19
00:01:27,830 --> 00:01:32,200
Okay so this will be literally the display name for me.

20
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,720
And in here we can see the bundle identifier that we have chosen.

21
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:44,810
Let me create this app of course we can choose a new bundle identifier if you want from here.

22
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:52,560
So we have something like a U.S. church in order here and on the right hand side you can see iPad or

23
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:53,010
iPhone.

24
00:01:53,010 --> 00:02:00,710
So if if I want to disable this app to be working on my iPad I can just uncheck and check again.

25
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:06,990
And the important thing to do is right now just go here to signing and capabilities in which you will

26
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:09,660
see this checkbox.

27
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,960
So make sure this is checked.

28
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:12,500
Okay.

29
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:14,590
Automatically manage signing.

30
00:02:14,610 --> 00:02:23,460
So this will sign you in using your Apple I.D. so you can say you enable automatic and in here if you

31
00:02:23,460 --> 00:02:26,500
don't see anything you can just say edit count.

32
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:35,520
And over here it will pop up a window asking you to just enter your Apple I.D. And if you don't have

33
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:41,610
an apple either you can create just click on this create a I thing and then you can create a free Apple

34
00:02:41,610 --> 00:02:43,400
I.D. for yourself.

35
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,740
Later on we're going to see how to create a developer account as well.

36
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:56,650
Right now I have my I.D. signed in so I can just select one and it will just automatically manage the

37
00:02:56,650 --> 00:03:04,920
signing for me and this will associate my Apple I.D. with my project so that X code and the apple will

38
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:08,700
know this project actually belongs to me.

39
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:14,320
So do this for general settings right now where are you going to come back here later on.

40
00:03:14,330 --> 00:03:18,520
Then we need something for these projects settings.

41
00:03:18,540 --> 00:03:19,380
OK.

42
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:23,400
And in here the most important file is the view controller.

43
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:24,880
That's first.

44
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,630
So this is very right.

45
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:27,600
Our code.

46
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:28,140
OK.

47
00:03:28,140 --> 00:03:31,970
This is where we're going to code our app.

48
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:34,860
This is where we're going to do our stuff.

49
00:03:34,860 --> 00:03:37,040
This is where we're going to do everything.

50
00:03:37,160 --> 00:03:42,570
And in here we see some semantically generated swift files like app delegates.

51
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:46,200
So we have a lot of codes here.

52
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:49,420
And right now you don't understand any of this.

53
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:51,930
We're going to come back to here later on.

54
00:03:51,930 --> 00:03:53,470
Don't worry about it.

55
00:03:53,490 --> 00:04:02,190
So this is another automatically generated file called Scene delegate in which we actually define the

56
00:04:02,340 --> 00:04:09,300
UI window the window that we're seeing in our app and where you going to come back here later on just

57
00:04:09,450 --> 00:04:14,620
for right now know that we're not going to do much in the app delegate or seen delegate.

58
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:22,200
We're just going to write our codes inside of our view controller dot swift and in here you will see

59
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:25,020
something called me in that storyboard.

60
00:04:25,050 --> 00:04:31,400
If you click on this file it will open an empty iPhone screen for you.

61
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:37,580
So in here we do the design of our app user interface of our apps.

62
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:47,160
So we drag in images we drag in texts we create some user interface in this file.

63
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:48,150
OK.

64
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:53,870
And D file this file is actually connected with the view controller dot Swift.

65
00:04:54,090 --> 00:05:01,690
It means that we get to design our app in this mean storyboard you can zoom in out like this in here

66
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:04,970
and we get to write our codes in the view controller.

67
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,820
That swift.

68
00:05:06,910 --> 00:05:12,940
And actually it's very easy to work with main story boards and we're going to see that later on.

69
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:22,030
And here we have some folder called a SATs and we play some images we play some icons in this folder.

70
00:05:22,070 --> 00:05:28,710
Okay we have some launch screen that Storyboard So this is a welcome screen for you.

71
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:35,620
If you put something over here it will be shown in the Vulcan section of your app like a logo of your

72
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:36,700
icon off your app.

73
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:37,650
OK.

74
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:41,290
And in here we have an info that peerless this file.

75
00:05:41,320 --> 00:05:45,210
We're going to change some of these options over here.

76
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:47,380
This is for general settings.

77
00:05:47,380 --> 00:05:52,590
Again we're going to use all of those files during government court.

78
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:57,670
So don't worry about it right now know that we're going to use you controller.

79
00:05:57,670 --> 00:05:58,540
That's Swift.

80
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:02,470
And we're going to use main that storyboard and lots.

81
00:06:02,790 --> 00:06:03,840
OK.

82
00:06:03,910 --> 00:06:04,540
Because why.

83
00:06:04,540 --> 00:06:08,240
Because this is very rewrite our code.

84
00:06:08,410 --> 00:06:15,160
So let me go over these buttons over here you will see something called Ed options adjust just Ed options

85
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:17,190
at just EDS.

86
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,450
So this is the main page.

87
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:24,520
This is the main section in which we write our code but we can change the screen.

88
00:06:25,060 --> 00:06:28,870
So if you click on Ed only nothing will change.

89
00:06:28,870 --> 00:06:37,000
But if you click on Ed and canvas if we were building for a swift UI it will open a preview layout for

90
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:37,630
you.

91
00:06:37,630 --> 00:06:45,340
Right now we don't have to worry for that because in the regular programming way without the swift UI

92
00:06:45,580 --> 00:06:46,980
we don't need.

93
00:06:46,980 --> 00:06:51,250
We won't have any canvas instead of cameras.

94
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:54,770
We have main storyboard in this project.

95
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:55,720
OK.

96
00:06:55,900 --> 00:07:02,680
And in here we have some other options as well like editor assistant if you click on this it will open

97
00:07:02,740 --> 00:07:04,120
another editor for you.

98
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:11,950
So you get to write code in the both screens right now and we're going to see how to leverage this to

99
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:19,210
Ed. think in our apps because you can't choose any file over here so you can compare the files or you

100
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:24,970
can work with view controller that swift on the one hand side and on the other hand you can work with

101
00:07:24,970 --> 00:07:33,130
the storyboard and we're going to do all of those things so we can closes Ed right now and we can continue

102
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,810
actually seeing the other options over here.

103
00:07:36,820 --> 00:07:43,390
So if you go to your main that storyboard and if you click on this you can just say editor and assistant

104
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:49,460
so you can work with the main storyboard on the one side and we have controller on the other side.

105
00:07:49,540 --> 00:07:56,810
So you get to design your app here and you get to write your code over here and we will connect our

106
00:07:56,820 --> 00:08:03,250
viewers connect our objects like images to the code using this technique later on.

107
00:08:04,120 --> 00:08:08,380
So again in here we see an ad editor below bottom.

108
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:10,970
So this does exactly the same thing.

109
00:08:10,990 --> 00:08:18,120
You add another editor over here so that's it for the main section actually.

110
00:08:18,130 --> 00:08:22,350
So on the left hand side we see the folders files on the middle side.

111
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:27,730
We see the coding section or design section on the right hand side.

112
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:34,120
We generally see the properties OK of the chosen object our Chosen View.

113
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:40,230
So for example in the main that storyboard if you choose something from this section.

114
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:40,940
OK.

115
00:08:40,960 --> 00:08:49,260
Like a weave controller or a view and we will have some images or texts or we're hearing later on.

116
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,900
You can see the properties of that V you can see the properties of that object in this page.

117
00:08:55,960 --> 00:09:02,810
For example we see something called history over here and this is related to get that.

118
00:09:02,830 --> 00:09:10,630
We have talked about so does like save point checkpoint control in the first place you will see where

119
00:09:10,630 --> 00:09:13,320
it is located on your computer.

120
00:09:13,330 --> 00:09:15,790
So in here we have help section.

121
00:09:15,790 --> 00:09:19,390
So this is the official documentation of Apple.

122
00:09:19,390 --> 00:09:27,550
We can read on that always and in here we see the identity Inspector code just connecting we use with

123
00:09:27,580 --> 00:09:30,610
each other we're going to see what this does later on.

124
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:38,020
So in here we see these attributes Inspector it's really gives you the options to choose the like if

125
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,380
you're working with a taxi you can check change the forms and the size of the text color of the tags

126
00:09:44,380 --> 00:09:45,640
and everything.

127
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:55,450
And for the fifth one we have this V over we're here in which we can choose the place and the size of

128
00:09:55,450 --> 00:09:56,980
the related object.

129
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:04,240
And on the last one we have something called Connections Inspector K we going to connect some of the

130
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:09,580
views with the code and we can break them or change them if we want to later on.

131
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:15,210
And this doesn't make any sense to you right now because you don't know anything yet about U.S. programming

132
00:10:15,210 --> 00:10:24,720
or swift but I'm just trying to explain the options the bodies the veil of this X scope to right now.

133
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:25,680
Okay.

134
00:10:26,020 --> 00:10:31,540
In here you will see a button called library if you click on this you can see these objects you can

135
00:10:31,540 --> 00:10:39,610
see the views that you can take and drag and drop on your view controller in the main that storyboard

136
00:10:40,450 --> 00:10:47,920
just for an example you can choose any of this and tried to drag and drop on your iPhone screen for

137
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:53,770
example is a button you can't click on those and you can write that code the inside of a button and

138
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:54,820
this is a label.

139
00:10:54,820 --> 00:11:00,510
This is just a tax you can write whatever you want inside of your labels.

140
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,180
So for right now for example just take this label and drag it on your screen and as you can see we can

141
00:11:07,180 --> 00:11:10,770
place the tax anywhere we want.

142
00:11:10,840 --> 00:11:16,980
And right now if you click on these attributes Inspector we can change the color of this label.

143
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:21,000
We can change the font size of the labor.

144
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:22,830
We can do whatever we want.

145
00:11:22,930 --> 00:11:30,310
So this is actually very easy you can change the alignment you can make it black you can make it bigger

146
00:11:30,310 --> 00:11:33,680
you can make it smaller whatever you want.

147
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,760
And this is actually fun.

148
00:11:35,770 --> 00:11:40,500
And this is very easy to create user interfaces.

149
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:49,210
And again if you double click on this you can change the size or you can change the actual text or here

150
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:52,310
like we can write helo Swift.

151
00:11:52,450 --> 00:11:54,580
So this is cool right.

152
00:11:54,580 --> 00:12:03,480
This is very easy to work on so we can create some stunning user interfaces using this mean that storyboard.

153
00:12:03,850 --> 00:12:12,940
If you go to hear X code preferences you can access the settings of the X code we can change the settings

154
00:12:12,940 --> 00:12:15,730
of X code using display over here.

155
00:12:15,940 --> 00:12:16,270
Okay.

156
00:12:16,300 --> 00:12:22,390
If you come to general or let me closes down line go to weave controllers so you can see it better because

157
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:27,500
I'm going to change the font size of X code and you will see how to do that.

158
00:12:27,520 --> 00:12:36,340
So let me go to X code preferences one more time if I come to general I will see the general settings

159
00:12:36,340 --> 00:12:38,080
of the X code.

160
00:12:38,470 --> 00:12:42,140
It's actually why still leave those as it is.

161
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:45,710
And in the accounts tab you can see your own applied.

162
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:51,460
Because you have already connected to your app lighting designing and capabilities section.

163
00:12:51,460 --> 00:12:59,230
So I'm going to just skip these behaviors and navigation and I'm going to go for fonts and colors because

164
00:12:59,770 --> 00:13:06,280
you can start with the basics and the most verbal be you will start with the basic one.

165
00:13:06,610 --> 00:13:08,650
And this is too small for me.

166
00:13:08,650 --> 00:13:17,200
So I'm going to go for presentation light or dark so since I'm recording this video I'm not going to

167
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,540
go for presentation large.

168
00:13:19,540 --> 00:13:20,170
OK.

169
00:13:20,260 --> 00:13:26,180
I'm going to go for presentation because the presentation large will be too big for me.

170
00:13:26,410 --> 00:13:29,590
If you like darker things you can go for dark.

171
00:13:29,590 --> 00:13:32,590
I'm not going to do that since I'm recording this.

172
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,630
If I wasn't recording I would have definitely gone for the dark.

173
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:49,000
OK so presentation light is the choice for me you can choose your own from here and you can just go

174
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:50,910
over these other settings as well.

175
00:13:50,920 --> 00:13:57,940
But if we need something from here in one of our projects I will definitely show you have to do that

176
00:13:57,940 --> 00:13:59,170
later on.

177
00:13:59,170 --> 00:14:03,500
But right now I'm going to leave all of these settings as it is.

178
00:14:03,550 --> 00:14:09,670
So let's stop here and continue building our first app within the next lecture.
