00:00:00.460 --> 00:00:01.040
Hi.

2
00:00:01.180 --> 00:00:02.600
We within this lecture.

3
00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:06.930
You going to take care of our signing in and signing up process.

4
00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:15.750
So let's go in our sign in we you comptroller and we're going to impart the higher base first of all

5
00:00:16.020 --> 00:00:19.990
because we're going to use the firebase modules over here.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:20.720
Right.

7
00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:27.510
And then we're going to use this password tags user name tags and email text because we want to check

8
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:30.070
to see if they're empty or not.

9
00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:39.390
So I'm going to say if user name text that text is not an empty string and if password tags that tax

10
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:47.420
is not an empty string Caswell and this time we're going to have the email tax as well.

11
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:55.440
In fact we're going to use user name text text for the first time over here because we're going to sign

12
00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:02.750
the users up and then we're going to use this user name to save their user name as well.

13
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:09.660
So let me create my make alert function over here because we're going to need it so much.

14
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:17.010
So I'm going to take in a title and a message as a string variable and I'm going to create my alert.

15
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.860
So this will be a UI alert controller.

16
00:01:19.950 --> 00:01:25.680
This will ask me for a title and I'm going to give it the title that I am taking as an input.

17
00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:33.210
And the message as well and the style will be an alert then I'm creating an okay button and this will

18
00:01:33.210 --> 00:01:35.330
be a UI alert action.

19
00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:43.490
This will ask me for a title which is OK and the style which is default and we don't need any handler.

20
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:50.670
So later on I'm going to add this as an action to my alert and I'm going to present this.

21
00:01:50.700 --> 00:01:51.240
OK.

22
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:54.000
Alert here with an animation.

23
00:01:54.120 --> 00:02:01.590
And without that completion I'm doing all of this very fast because we have been doing it for a long

24
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:03.170
time right now.

25
00:02:03.210 --> 00:02:10.440
So for a title I'm going to say error and for message why don't you give me a user name password or

26
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:11.330
e-mail.

27
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:13.130
OK.

28
00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:21.670
So over here if this are if these conditions hold then I'm going to sign my users up.

29
00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:24.680
So I'm going to use off in order to do that.

30
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:28.290
And remember we have to go for create user.

31
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:33.440
So when we say create user it will ask us for an e-mail and a password.

32
00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:39.800
So e-mail will come from e-mail text the text and I can for as I wrap this.

33
00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:47.970
And for password I need password text that text right now for completion block I will hit enter.

34
00:02:48.030 --> 00:02:51.600
It will give me either an old they tell results.

35
00:02:51.630 --> 00:02:55.380
I'm going to call this off and or an error.

36
00:02:55.380 --> 00:03:04.440
OK so let me close this down and if error is not nil then I'm going to display this air to the user.

37
00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:10.920
So I'm going to say South stop make Ellard and title will be error and the message will be error dot

38
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:12.410
localized description.

39
00:03:12.510 --> 00:03:19.530
And if this is actually not an error message I'm going to display only the error message.

40
00:03:20.490 --> 00:03:25.770
So else if there is not any error what do I do.

41
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:34.980
I want to perform I Segway way actually OK to feed we see and of course I'm going to do this eventually

42
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.820
anyway.

43
00:03:35.820 --> 00:03:43.610
But before we do that I want to go ahead and save my user name to defy your base file your sir.

44
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:51.300
So there's no way there is no space to save our user name in the authentication module.

45
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:53.620
So I'm going to use five sir.

46
00:03:53.760 --> 00:04:02.490
Of course other down besides the end user name you can just say whatever you want like user gender user

47
00:04:02.870 --> 00:04:08.850
other specifications user location user country using phone number.

48
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:12.600
But I I'm just going to go for user name.

49
00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:15.270
But you will understand how this works.

50
00:04:15.660 --> 00:04:20.010
So first of all I need to create my father's store variable.

51
00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:28.700
OK so this is fire started out fire store and I will use this fire as store to create a collection.

52
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:32.180
So remember we have worked with posts before.

53
00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:35.120
Right now I'm going to call this user info.

54
00:04:35.190 --> 00:04:39.700
After that I'm going to say user info dot adds document.

55
00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:46.770
So this will ask me for a string to any dictionary and I'm going to call this user a dictionary in which

56
00:04:46.770 --> 00:04:50.850
we will have the email address of the user.

57
00:04:50.850 --> 00:04:59.070
And I can get this from email text and why I'm saving this because I'm going to search for our user

58
00:04:59.070 --> 00:05:05.990
name this email later on so I can get this from off as well.

59
00:05:05.990 --> 00:05:12.530
But since I have this on my user email text texts it's easier to get it from there.

60
00:05:12.530 --> 00:05:16.950
So email text that's text okay.

61
00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:22.520
And then later on I'm going to just save the user name as well.

62
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:26.300
And this will be from the user name text not text.

63
00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.790
So this is the dictionary that I'm looking for.

64
00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:35.000
So come over here and say user dictionary and as you can see there's a strength to strength you dictionary

65
00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:40.370
and I'm going to cast is as to be a string to any dictionary.

66
00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:40.970
OK.

67
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:42.920
Once I do that.

68
00:05:43.040 --> 00:05:43.210
Yeah.

69
00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.740
It asks me to put stuff over here and it's right because we are in a closure right.

70
00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.730
And then later on I believe this will give us an warning saying that.

71
00:05:58.010 --> 00:05:58.240
Yeah.

72
00:05:58.250 --> 00:06:04.620
Why don't you use just an S. rather down first casting this.

73
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.910
Yeah we can do that as long as we have string to any dictionary.

74
00:06:08.930 --> 00:06:15.890
Doesn't matter for us and in here I'm going to hit enter because I'm going to get an error over here

75
00:06:16.250 --> 00:06:20.840
and I'm going to check to see if this error is nil or not.

76
00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:27.920
So in this case it's your choice to display any error message to the user since you have been doing

77
00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.230
that already.

78
00:06:29.270 --> 00:06:37.280
You may want to do that over here as well or you may just skip it but at this point the user connection

79
00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.990
may get lost or something.

80
00:06:39.290 --> 00:06:44.780
So maybe you can just go ahead and display this error message over here as well.

81
00:06:44.850 --> 00:06:50.630
And if this works well then it will just save my user name to defy your star.

82
00:06:50.660 --> 00:06:58.540
So let me test this and let's see if we can see the user name and email in the fire star.

83
00:06:58.640 --> 00:07:05.620
So once I hit the rumba then you will see some warnings over here which are related to failure your

84
00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:07.130
base modules mostly.

85
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:13.760
So I'm going to ignore them and this will take some time as you can see it's trying to build 9000 tasks

86
00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:18.850
because we have so much task because we have imported firebase.

87
00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:25.740
So we have to wait until it's finished and then we're going to try our code.

88
00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:32.430
And if this works out then we will see the email and our user name in the fires sir.

89
00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.810
So let's test this.

90
00:07:33.830 --> 00:07:40.100
I'm going to say James that Metallica that's come over here and James Hetfield has user name and I'm

91
00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:43.470
going to give some one two three four five six password.

92
00:07:43.610 --> 00:07:48.540
If I had sign up button it will sign me up and bring me into the feed.

93
00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:58.160
So if I go over here if I refresh this and we're not in the database I'm just refreshing this search.

94
00:07:58.190 --> 00:08:01.730
So let me go into the database and here you go.

95
00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:08.860
Now we see the user info collection and once it loads we will see the details like documents.

96
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:12.670
And here you go we see the email and the user name.

97
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:17.120
Now I can try to get this user name by just providing the email.

98
00:08:17.210 --> 00:08:21.540
And of course in the authentication I have my user as well.

99
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:23.960
Now it's all good.

100
00:08:24.170 --> 00:08:31.340
So we have our email I user name start in the user info collection.

101
00:08:31.340 --> 00:08:34.580
Now where are you going to use that later on in the feed.

102
00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:35.810
We have a controller.

103
00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:38.950
But right now let me go to sign in.

104
00:08:38.960 --> 00:08:40.020
We have controller.

105
00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:44.360
OK because we are going to take care of this signing clicked function as well.

106
00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:53.120
So I'm going to copy and paste this because we're going to check to see if these are empty or not again.

107
00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:59.480
And if these are empty we're going to display the same error message and in here we're going to call

108
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:06.170
the authentication one more time and rather than creating the user we're going to sign the user in that

109
00:09:06.290 --> 00:09:13.970
email and password and completion block so e-mail will come from e-mail text and password will come

110
00:09:13.970 --> 00:09:16.380
from Password text.

111
00:09:16.400 --> 00:09:19.270
So let's say e-mail tax not text.

112
00:09:19.310 --> 00:09:20.520
OK.

113
00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:27.800
And for passwords say password tax that text I'm for signing up this and completion hit enter.

114
00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.410
This will give me either a result or an error.

115
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:39.040
So as a result an error if error is not nil then I'm going to display this error message to the user.

116
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:45.250
So I'm going to say self-taught make alerts and title will be error the message will be errors that

117
00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:47.060
localised description.

118
00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:55.620
And if this is empty I'm going to say error owls owls I'm going to do a Segway and I'm going to do the

119
00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:57.110
say grade to feed.

120
00:09:57.190 --> 00:10:05.140
We have controller OK there will be Neal and in fact at this point we don't need to check to see if

121
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:10.640
the user name text is empty or not because you're not going to use this user name.

122
00:10:10.690 --> 00:10:14.180
We can just sign in the user with email and password.

123
00:10:14.290 --> 00:10:21.880
Even though we're going to use the user name in the real app at this point we just need the email and

124
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.840
password.

125
00:10:22.840 --> 00:10:28.860
If they are signing in in the sign up of course we have to check it because we want to save it to the

126
00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.330
fire star.

127
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:38.610
So let me open it one more time and try to do as sign in from here so I'm going to say James said Metallica

128
00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:46.360
dot com and for password I'm going to give one two three four five six and sign him in as you can see

129
00:10:46.390 --> 00:10:50.930
now you're signed in and we're in the feed we've controller.

130
00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:56.090
Of course we have to take care of this out and remember user functions.

131
00:10:56.170 --> 00:10:59.260
That's what we're going to do within the next lecture.
