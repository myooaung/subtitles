00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:08.110
Hi within these two sections we have been working on design and Adobe Steve for some time and we have

2
00:00:08.110 --> 00:00:12.130
learned the basics the essentials of the Adobe Steve.

3
00:00:12.310 --> 00:00:18.730
But if you don't feel yourself comfortable by creating a design from scratch so that you can use it

4
00:00:18.730 --> 00:00:26.410
on your own app you can actually go and Google for some free resources so that you can download them

5
00:00:26.620 --> 00:00:34.540
and edit them and adjust them to your own app so that you can have really good looking apps.

6
00:00:34.540 --> 00:00:37.050
OK so let me show you an example.

7
00:00:37.060 --> 00:00:45.280
I'm just going to search for Adobe the U.S. resources as you can see we have a lot of results showing

8
00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:46.750
up in here.

9
00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:54.070
So the first ones are actually the Apple design resources that we have seen before and we have the adobe

10
00:00:54.070 --> 00:00:55.630
dot com as well.

11
00:00:55.630 --> 00:00:59.920
I'm just going to skip all of this and scroll down a little bit.

12
00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:05.330
For example we're going to go for these extreme resources dot co.

13
00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:13.380
And let me go for something else like SD grew dot com and don't worry that it's saying that IRS twelve

14
00:01:13.390 --> 00:01:14.140
for us.

15
00:01:14.140 --> 00:01:16.040
LEMON You get fined.

16
00:01:16.040 --> 00:01:18.460
The latest ones here as well.

17
00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:26.950
For example let me go over here to the group and here you see some free UI kits so you can just click

18
00:01:26.950 --> 00:01:30.970
over here and you will see you have a lot of options.

19
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:37.120
So for example we can search for IRS or we can just browse is and as you can see we have some UI kit

20
00:01:37.120 --> 00:01:46.930
for bookstore sample and we have some restaurant sample as well and we can just go for does extra resources

21
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:47.960
doubts Co.

22
00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:52.300
And here we see DHS 12th but we're not interested in IRS to us.

23
00:01:52.300 --> 00:02:01.330
So let me come over here and just take a look around in this Corwin app I believe this is this has something

24
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:05.110
to do with bitcoin or other crypto currencies.

25
00:02:05.230 --> 00:02:10.290
So maybe we can actually download this to see how it looks like.

26
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.260
So here you go.

27
00:02:11.260 --> 00:02:12.210
This is an app.

28
00:02:12.220 --> 00:02:17.040
So this is a design for specifically cryptocurrency apps.

29
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:21.240
But for example let's suppose that we're building a cryptocurrency app.

30
00:02:21.250 --> 00:02:27.850
So we see this and we can just download this and we can use this on our apps.

31
00:02:27.850 --> 00:02:28.870
OK.

32
00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.060
So let me find another example like we have Apple Pay or here.

33
00:02:34.330 --> 00:02:38.860
And I believe this is too simple so let me go something.

34
00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:44.100
Let me go for something more complicated like this answer Lee app OK.

35
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:49.990
You can just download this one as well to see if we can get it.

36
00:02:49.990 --> 00:02:51.070
So let me see.

37
00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:53.050
Do we have a download button over here.

38
00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:53.850
Yep.

39
00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.200
So let me just click on that.

40
00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:57.020
Yep.

41
00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.920
This is actually in the dropbox.

42
00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:06.370
So let me direct download this so that I can just use it on my computer.

43
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:11.580
And let me open the downloads folder so let me start with code in app.

44
00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.210
So let's see how it looks like.

45
00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:14.380
So here you go.

46
00:03:14.380 --> 00:03:17.470
We have a web app and we have an ISIS app.

47
00:03:17.470 --> 00:03:23.200
So we're interested in this particular one and here that we have some buttons.

48
00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:24.890
We have some graphics.

49
00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.810
We have some labels over here we can actually use those.

50
00:03:28.810 --> 00:03:35.950
So if you're not actually building and cryptocurrency app but somehow you managed to get this in your

51
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.090
computer maybe you're particularly interested in this bottom.

52
00:03:41.470 --> 00:03:48.520
So maybe you can edit this button or maybe you can just export this bottom as it is if you click on

53
00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:54.700
this button you can just say mark for export and you can just export this one if you want and you can

54
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:56.420
use it on your own app.

55
00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:57.260
Right.

56
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:03.470
You can try to change the color you can try to use some view elements from here.

57
00:04:03.610 --> 00:04:10.240
And it's cool because you have a lot of options in the internets and they're actually free.

58
00:04:10.240 --> 00:04:12.160
So let me open this one as well.

59
00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:19.270
So this is as early app so maybe I'm interested in the search bar or does micro form icon or the search

60
00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.070
icon.

61
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:23.910
I can easily take those and use it on my own app.

62
00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:32.560
So make sure you read the documentation from here and make sure it's actually free to using your own

63
00:04:32.560 --> 00:04:38.110
app in order to avoid any patterns or any other license issues.

64
00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:38.950
OK.

65
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:43.510
But after you make sure you can actually use it you can actually change it.

66
00:04:43.570 --> 00:04:47.350
You can edit it and use it on your own apps.

67
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:53.970
And for example if you're building your restaurant app it's a good idea to search these Web sites for

68
00:04:53.980 --> 00:05:02.330
restaurant UI kits and find a related one so that you can easily adjust it to use your own apps using

69
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:03.250
your own apps.

70
00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:07.030
Okay so I hope you enjoyed this cars.

71
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:09.770
So this is the last section.

72
00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:16.880
Don't forget to write and review the cars and if you managed to build something good out of these cars

73
00:05:17.180 --> 00:05:22.550
don't forget to send it to me so that I can share with other students as well.

74
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:29.510
In order to promote your app and in order to celebrate your success all together so take care and see

75
00:05:29.510 --> 00:05:31.220
you in another class.
