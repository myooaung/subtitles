00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:08,670
Hi within this lecture we're going to see how to create a bottom using this kind of code once more so

2
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:16,830
we're not going to be using main that storyboard again but doing that requires some other techniques

3
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:17,430
as well.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:22,020
So we're going to learn how to work with selector functions.

5
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:27,280
OK so let me start by creating my you I bottom.

6
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,440
So this is not different from UI label.

7
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:38,070
So this is the bottom object that we need to use in order to create our bottom.

8
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:45,580
So I can just reach the attributes of my button like I can just say my button that set aside.

9
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,530
So and that's how you write something inside of a bottom.

10
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:59,820
So in here you can say for example my bottom and in this case it asks you for a controlled state if

11
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,920
you hit enter and hit dot you will see some options.

12
00:01:04,950 --> 00:01:09,810
I'm gonna go for normal but there are some states like highlight.

13
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,050
OK so this brings up as a button in a highlighted mode.

14
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:23,760
So you really don't go for highlighters or other options generally but you can try to see what are the

15
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,320
other options and how does it look when you at the next thing.

16
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,390
I'm gonna go for a set titled color.

17
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:39,960
So in here I have to define a color and in order to define a color you just call you a color as you

18
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,330
can see this is an object that stores colored data.

19
00:01:43,730 --> 00:01:44,430
OK.

20
00:01:44,550 --> 00:01:49,800
If you do that you can hit dot and reach black blue brown.

21
00:01:50,130 --> 00:01:53,030
So I'm going to go for blue.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,940
And in here again it asks for a state.

23
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,100
And I'm going to go for normal.

24
00:01:58,230 --> 00:02:04,080
So normally we have blue colors in buttons as you might already know.

25
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,080
So after that I have to give a frame as usual.

26
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:11,090
OK.

27
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,140
So I will call frame and see direct once more.

28
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:22,950
And it will ask me for x y width and height so we can do the same thing that we have been doing in the

29
00:02:22,950 --> 00:02:24,540
previous lecture right.

30
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:28,160
So we can do this relative to the width and height.

31
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:34,610
So I can just say with our multiplied by 0 point four ends.

32
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:38,920
So let's go for y we begin to see how does it look.

33
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:41,720
And then we can change those values.

34
00:02:41,790 --> 00:02:47,630
So for y I'm going to go for height multiplied by 0 7.

35
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:56,950
Now for the vids it embodies actually we can have some say tick numbers like a hundred or two hundred.

36
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:04,230
So I'm not going to create this relative to the screen size because Reagon I have my bottom tied to

37
00:03:04,510 --> 00:03:04,930
anyway.

38
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:13,550
So if it fits then it will be okay for us later on you can add this to yours view by calling this.

39
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:18,570
And if I run this we will see the button appearing on our view.

40
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:20,520
Let's see where does it appear.

41
00:03:20,520 --> 00:03:29,070
As you can see all point seven VI height multiplied by 0 point 7 brings us to this place.

42
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:36,420
So it's a little bit of maybe we can make this a little bit lower or something like 0 point 6 and let's

43
00:03:36,420 --> 00:03:39,800
make this 0 point five minus one hundredth.

44
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:49,710
So I'm deducting D width divided by two one more because I want to make this in a central way.

45
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:58,050
So if I do this that I will see my button is placed right under my text right under my label.

46
00:03:58,100 --> 00:04:06,440
OK then that comes the question How can I add an action to my bottom in order to do that.

47
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:09,140
I want to add that target.

48
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:15,130
So this is very you might get confused in order to do this.

49
00:04:15,300 --> 00:04:19,230
We have to understand what the target is.

50
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:26,160
So for Target I'm gonna go for S and S refers to weave controller itself.

51
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:27,000
Okay.

52
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,590
As you can see when I write self it sees that this is we've controller.

53
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,950
And why would I do that.

54
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:40,430
Because I'm going to call and function as an action next.

55
00:04:40,490 --> 00:04:42,060
Okay.

56
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:46,020
And I will explain this with the documentation in a moment.

57
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:48,930
So you will down their son much better.

58
00:04:48,930 --> 00:04:56,230
Let me first write this down and then we were very going to go over it one more time.

59
00:04:56,550 --> 00:05:05,440
So if it asks Senate selector as an action it means that we have to create a function in which we going

60
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:13,830
to call from view controller gave from self and then where are you going to assign this as a selector.

61
00:05:13,830 --> 00:05:16,980
So let me create a function that you will see what I mean.

62
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:19,340
Let me called is my action.

63
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:20,160
Okay.

64
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:28,670
So I'm creating a basic function over here and in this function I'm just gonna go for tapped.

65
00:05:28,690 --> 00:05:32,040
Okay I'm just going to print something I will see it's in the logs.

66
00:05:33,090 --> 00:05:38,780
So right now I can come over here and I can just call my action.

67
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:47,100
But as you can see I cannot do that because it asks for a selector in order to make this work.

68
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:56,930
I I can't do this selector and it asks for an object to see method as you can see over here.

69
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:06,720
Now I can come here and just write my action but in order to make this work I have to go and say we

70
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:07,590
have controller.

71
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:09,440
That's my action.

72
00:06:09,510 --> 00:06:18,000
Now I have to come to my action and put at object to see in the from in the beginning of this function.

73
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:25,890
OK so this is now an object to see function and it can be called as a selector.

74
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:34,350
So whenever somebody taps on my button dysfunction we'll get called and I will see the printing values

75
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:35,970
on the logs.

76
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:45,810
So and in here it asks for an event if if you hit enter and then he does it you will see some events.

77
00:06:45,900 --> 00:06:49,060
It asks for them to call this.

78
00:06:49,170 --> 00:06:53,280
So you will see something like touch up inside.

79
00:06:53,550 --> 00:06:58,890
Touch up inside means whenever somebody touches up that's by them.

80
00:07:00,270 --> 00:07:06,940
So right now I'm going to go over this one more time so we can see it better.

81
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:14,160
If you press command on your keyboard and click this you can go to the documentation like this.

82
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:22,990
It saves in the target parameter that this target object it is the object whose action method is going

83
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:24,540
to be cold.

84
00:07:24,550 --> 00:07:29,150
So we're going to call the function of a view controller right.

85
00:07:29,230 --> 00:07:34,460
And then you write self you refer one up class.

86
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:37,540
So we're inside of our v controller.

87
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:47,020
So if I say self it will refer to the V controller as you can see so I can add this as a target.

88
00:07:47,140 --> 00:07:52,240
Then the action that I'm going to specify should be in that target.

89
00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:02,260
So that's why I'm creating this my action inside of my class and this will be called if I touch up inside

90
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:03,310
to that button.

91
00:08:04,540 --> 00:08:10,850
So let's testers as you can see if I touch my button it prints out tapped.

92
00:08:11,590 --> 00:08:13,490
So this works right.

93
00:08:13,510 --> 00:08:20,020
I can do whatever in I want in this function right now.

94
00:08:20,170 --> 00:08:21,640
So what can I do.

95
00:08:21,910 --> 00:08:30,130
Maybe all you want to change these labels text but I cannot reach my label from here because why.

96
00:08:30,130 --> 00:08:32,710
Because it's not in the scope of this function.

97
00:08:33,610 --> 00:08:38,610
And what should I do to reach that label form here.

98
00:08:38,620 --> 00:08:46,450
Of course I have to define my label not in the reloaded load but I have to define my label outside of

99
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:49,980
the functions inside of my class.

100
00:08:50,110 --> 00:09:01,140
So I'm going to take let my label UI label line up in the class and then I can reach it down my function.

101
00:09:01,180 --> 00:09:08,560
So cut this line or just write it over here like wah my label UI label.

102
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:13,940
OK and then you can delete this line.

103
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,100
And then there's my label.

104
00:09:16,110 --> 00:09:22,690
VILA referred to the pre newly created variable over here as you can see taillights.

105
00:09:22,690 --> 00:09:29,290
When I click on it now I can call these my labels from with the ad load.

106
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:31,000
And from here as well.

107
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:37,460
Now I can say my label text is something new like tapped.

108
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:47,360
OK so this is how you connect to used together you have to define those v variables inside of your class.

109
00:09:47,370 --> 00:09:49,660
But outside of your functions.

110
00:09:50,410 --> 00:09:52,290
So let me test this.

111
00:09:52,330 --> 00:09:57,250
So if I click on this you will see it's tapped.

112
00:09:57,250 --> 00:10:04,120
Now you have learned how to create views just by using code without using mean that storyboard.

113
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:11,560
And it gives you great power it gives you power to create views relative to the screen sites.

114
00:10:11,770 --> 00:10:16,340
And again there is actually a better way to achieve this result.

115
00:10:16,340 --> 00:10:18,470
Now it's called SWIFT UI.

116
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:24,310
We're going to see what is swift UI in the next lecture but we're not going to deep dive into this because

117
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,340
you have to understand swift in an advanced way before we move on to that.

118
00:10:30,430 --> 00:10:33,040
We're just in the beginning right now.

119
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:35,000
We're just learning about swift.

120
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,350
We're going to have intermediate swift takes a section.

121
00:10:38,360 --> 00:10:44,100
Are we going to have advanced swift section and then we will move on to swift UI.

122
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:52,810
Right now I'm going to go and create all our applications with storyboards because why.

123
00:10:52,810 --> 00:11:03,070
Because swift UI will be effective as AOS 13 and we're shooting for a starting design IOW 13 cars.

124
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:10,000
I know that but the migration to IO is 13 will not be completed in a month.

125
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:18,010
So people will have to download IO is 13 people will have to migrated like 80 90 percent of the people

126
00:11:18,280 --> 00:11:23,800
will migrate it and then we will be ready to write applications purely in swift UI.

127
00:11:24,760 --> 00:11:32,770
So that's why we're focusing on storyboards in these cars and we're going to learn about swift design

128
00:11:32,920 --> 00:11:36,090
anyway in order to be ready for the future.

129
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:37,890
So let's do that in the next lecture.
