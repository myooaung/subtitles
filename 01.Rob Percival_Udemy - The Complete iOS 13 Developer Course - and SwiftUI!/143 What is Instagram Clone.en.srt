Hi within this section we're going to be building this fantastic app in which we're going to create

2
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:08,460
a clone of Instagram.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,190
So let me log out from here and I'm going to start telling buy from scratch.

4
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:20,790
So we have a log in page in which our user can give their email address and password and if they match

5
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:30,030
with the server they can log in to the app and let me show this by example if I say last at Metallica

6
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,500
dot com and this user does not have this password.

7
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:41,040
As you can see we cannot sign it and we can't try with a user that doesn't even exist on the database

8
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:47,700
like Kirk hit Metallica dot com and it won't even sign in again if the passwords match of course we

9
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:49,100
can't sign it but we.

10
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:50,000
But we can do.

11
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:56,250
We can create a user called Kirk at Metallica dot com by clicking the sign up as you can see we are

12
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:59,910
inside and I can go to log out whenever I want.

13
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,290
So in the upload section if I choose a picture from the gallery I can write a comment and I can share

14
00:01:07,290 --> 00:01:10,840
it to see it on my feed later on.

15
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:16,650
So if I say upload it will upload this picture and the comment to the server and it will immediately

16
00:01:16,650 --> 00:01:24,100
download it and show me in the feed as you can see there are different kinds of users sharing this page

17
00:01:24,100 --> 00:01:30,960
is sharing this posts and we can see them all we can even like them if we want like here.

18
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:39,750
So Bambi tap on this like it goes to the firebase database it uploads the current value and then just

19
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:44,610
downloads it and immediately refreshes the like label.

20
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:52,650
So in here you can see my database we're using Firebase and in the authentication we can see the users

21
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:57,270
and we we we're going to learn how to work with database where you're going to learn how to work with

22
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:58,270
storage.

23
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,080
We're going to learn how to work with authentication as well.

24
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:06,560
So if I can open this one more time.

25
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:13,350
Furthermore aside from firebase we're going to be learning how to work with Tab bars how to create custom

26
00:02:13,350 --> 00:02:16,760
use surely this app will teach us a lot.

27
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:24,150
After completing this section you're going to be much more confident in U.S. developments and you will

28
00:02:24,150 --> 00:02:32,940
be able to come up with an idea to create your own dream app on your own using this kind of technique.

29
00:02:33,630 --> 00:02:40,410
So if you're ready let's get started in the next lecture because we have a long way to go in this section.
