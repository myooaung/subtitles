00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.860
Hi within the lecture we're going to take care of data problem so that we can actually save the current

2
00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:15.500
day that we are into to defy your store database so that we can retrieve all those values ordered by

3
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.860
dates later on.

4
00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:24.390
So if you come back here too far you're supposed to right now you're just writing the value of date

5
00:00:24.480 --> 00:00:27.180
as a date as a dummy value.

6
00:00:27.180 --> 00:00:31.520
Now I'm going to delete this and I'm going to write field value.

7
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:40.020
Okay so this form field value and we're going to say field value dot server timestamp.

8
00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:46.920
So this is like a current timestamp that we can store to the five year star database and it gives us

9
00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:56.700
the year and the month they our minutes and seconds as well so that we can use this safely when we try

10
00:00:56.700 --> 00:01:04.410
to order everything by date and in fact there are lot of other techniques to generate data and save

11
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:12.030
them to the server as well so we can use swift techniques to generate data to get data in a format that

12
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:12.780
we want.

13
00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:15.480
But I just don't want to complicate things.

14
00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.110
And if you use this field value that server timestamp it will take the current date and save it to your

15
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:27.900
file your store and we're going to test this and you will see what does it look like when we upload

16
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.990
our first past after this.

17
00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:37.410
So in here in the owl section if this succeeds what do we want to do.

18
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:44.100
Remember we're just now sitting in the upload we've controller of course we want to reset the comment

19
00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:49.170
and UI image and then go back to first we have controller.

20
00:01:49.370 --> 00:01:55.650
And in order to go to the feed we have controller we are going to use the tab bar controller.

21
00:01:55.780 --> 00:02:01.260
If you say selected index that you can't specify an index.

22
00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:03.410
For example if you say zero.

23
00:02:03.450 --> 00:02:06.780
Let me open our apps from here.

24
00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.380
If you say 0 it will take you to the first index.

25
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:16.270
If you say 1 it will take you to the upload and if you say 2 it will take you to the settings.

26
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:22.290
So when you work with a tab part controller you can change the index only by writing this one simple

27
00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:23.360
line of code.

28
00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:24.510
OK.

29
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:31.830
And then we have to make sure tapped to select image is placed into the image view and uncommon text

30
00:02:31.830 --> 00:02:34.500
is reset in order to do that.

31
00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:42.540
I'm going to go over here and say south that image view that image is now a UI image and we will just

32
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.880
give it a name.

33
00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:52.400
And I believe we have named this as select that PSG right and we can just come over here and say South

34
00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:57.250
Dad's comment tax that text is now an empty string.

35
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:00.820
So this will make everything right.

36
00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:01.400
Here you go.

37
00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:03.320
Now we can test this.

38
00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:12.080
So we're testing if we can actually provide the dates value to our five year store and for some reason

39
00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:14.120
my fire year base is closed.

40
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:22.220
So let me go to council from here and we're going to have to click on and choose the current project

41
00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:23.870
that we're working on.

42
00:03:23.870 --> 00:03:27.250
So in my case this is this to qualify your base.

43
00:03:27.260 --> 00:03:35.180
Now I can go to my database here and in fact we can see the changes in the database in real time if

44
00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:39.680
you just open it and live it like this.

45
00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.540
You're going to see what I mean.

46
00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:47.570
So let me choose a picture from here and let me write something like my favorite picture.

47
00:03:47.620 --> 00:03:48.070
Okay.

48
00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:54.790
If you hit upload just it will just upload the storage and take back to your URL.

49
00:03:54.800 --> 00:04:02.010
And as you can see it took me to the feed and in the real time it added my data to here.

50
00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.140
So here you go.

51
00:04:03.140 --> 00:04:04.390
We have the data here.

52
00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:07.540
Let me zoom in a little bit so you can see better.

53
00:04:07.550 --> 00:04:12.080
So this is the day and the year and the hour.

54
00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:15.560
So we have everything up till these seconds.

55
00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:17.090
So it works.

56
00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.350
OK.

57
00:04:18.410 --> 00:04:22.720
And I believe we can test this one more time.

58
00:04:22.730 --> 00:04:31.370
We don't have to rerun this simulator because we are not changing anything as you can see it is reset

59
00:04:31.670 --> 00:04:41.210
because we have made it so we have reset the command text and we made Image view in the way that we

60
00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:41.790
want.

61
00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:49.340
And as you can see we do it again it just creates the past so we can see the information in here as

62
00:04:49.340 --> 00:04:50.360
well.

63
00:04:50.360 --> 00:04:52.820
So that's good.

64
00:04:52.820 --> 00:04:58.800
That's working so we actually completed the process of uploading.

65
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:06.170
Now we're getting the data we're getting the image likes comments and post owner and I'm going to delete

66
00:05:06.260 --> 00:05:09.470
this one because we don't have any data in here.

67
00:05:09.500 --> 00:05:18.890
OK so we only have two posts in which we all have dates and within the next picture we're going to get

68
00:05:18.890 --> 00:05:21.560
these information from the five year star.

69
00:05:21.560 --> 00:05:23.930
So we want them to be consistent.

70
00:05:23.930 --> 00:05:24.230
OK.

71
00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:31.910
So if you have any other dummy values tests pass in here make sure you delete everything and start from

72
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:32.570
scratch.

73
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:33.510
OK.

74
00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:36.710
So we want to add a feed in here.

75
00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:42.980
Basically a custom table we we need we can display all of this information to the user.

76
00:05:43.010 --> 00:05:44.570
We haven't done it yet.

77
00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:48.050
So where are we going to learn a new technique as well.

78
00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:50.200
And it's a little bit long.

79
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:57.110
So we have to stop here and within the next lecture you're going to see how to customize table use cells.
