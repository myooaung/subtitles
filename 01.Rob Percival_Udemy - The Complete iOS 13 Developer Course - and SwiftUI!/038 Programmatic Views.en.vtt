00:00:00.500 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:09.210
Following this re going to focus on creating views not with sorry words but with code.

3
00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:17.340
Okay so I'm going to create a new project I'm going to go for a single weave app and I'm just going

4
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:22.380
to name this project objects with code.

5
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:29.340
So we will be creating objects with called rather than Main storyboard.

6
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:36.110
So I'm going to go and save this on my eyes complete folder.

7
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:43.350
Ok so let me say create and we will be building our app in this project.

8
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.230
So why do we use code.

9
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:52.290
Why do we want to use code instead of mean that Storyboard So mean storyboard is actually pretty good

10
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:52.560
right.

11
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:59.370
We can do everything we can just see the options we can see the attributes and everything and we can

12
00:00:59.370 --> 00:01:02.430
change them in here we can see the design.

13
00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:07.320
Why do we want to create some V with code.

14
00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:16.090
Because with code we get to create some views with respect to to screen size.

15
00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:16.520
OK.

16
00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:25.050
So we can do something like this create a button and calculate the distance of the width of the current

17
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:33.540
screen size and create the button respective to that value or just calculate the height of the current

18
00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:38.140
screen size and create the button according to that value.

19
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:42.720
So in order to do that I'm going to go for my of the load.

20
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:44.220
So what is with the load.

21
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:45.330
Again remember.

22
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:49.930
So this is what happens when the first we have loads.

23
00:01:50.160 --> 00:01:57.650
So this is what happens by users sees when user actually opens the app.

24
00:01:57.780 --> 00:02:00.030
So I'm going to do my things here.

25
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:08.820
So I'm going to say my label is a UI labels so our labels that we drag and drop to a view is actually

26
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.040
a UI label objects.

27
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.560
So I can say my label the text is a test label so I can reach the attributes of label from here rather

28
00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:23.000
than the attributes pane on the right hand side.

29
00:02:23.010 --> 00:02:32.570
For example I can just change the text alignment here right so I can just say text alignment dot center.

30
00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:38.340
So it means that just make it center or you can choose left and right as well.

31
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.730
So I'm gonna go for center.

32
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:48.100
So it's nothing different than adding the label and clicking over here to change the attributes.

33
00:02:49.470 --> 00:02:53.630
Okay so we're okay with does my label think.

34
00:02:53.970 --> 00:03:01.860
And we're getting some error if you do comment B it will build your current app and if you're getting

35
00:03:01.860 --> 00:03:05.900
an error for no reason it will go away.

36
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.550
So again what do we want.

37
00:03:08.550 --> 00:03:10.770
We want to specify right.

38
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.600
This label is going to be located on my v cape.

39
00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:20.920
So right now I created it but I don't know where it will be.

40
00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:21.420
All right.

41
00:03:21.420 --> 00:03:27.750
I cannot drag and drop this imaginary object right now in order to do that.

42
00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:36.720
I'm going to go for fraid so I'm going to give a frame to this view and it describes the view's location

43
00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:46.110
and size so the size is important as well I didn't specify I haven't specified the location I haven't

44
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:50.270
specified the size yet that's what frame is for.

45
00:03:50.310 --> 00:04:01.170
So after you do that frame you have to do C direct and open parentheses because this is what I expected

46
00:04:01.170 --> 00:04:06.990
from us this is asking for an x and y value and the width and height value.

47
00:04:07.350 --> 00:04:16.230
Okay so the X stands for the place in the x axis and Y Y is actually standing for the y axis.

48
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:24.600
Okay the vertical axis is Y and the horizontal axis is X and that is actually the width of the object

49
00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.720
height is actually the height of the object.

50
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:34.830
So for example I'm going to go for hundred two hundred and I will see what does this label look like.

51
00:04:35.780 --> 00:04:40.370
And I'm going to be okay after this.

52
00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:49.500
I can just add this to my view and in order to do that I'm going to call value that add sub view.

53
00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:55.400
Okay you can do it like this view and it refers to the UI view itself.

54
00:04:55.470 --> 00:04:56.090
Okay.

55
00:04:56.190 --> 00:05:01.440
The view remember when you choose the app from here.

56
00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:05.970
The view itself is located inside of this view controller.

57
00:05:05.970 --> 00:05:11.330
So are we referring to this view by typing viewing the view controller.

58
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:23.520
So I will say view dot at some view interval ask me for a view to add my label will be my sub view.

59
00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.180
Now let's go and try this.

60
00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:34.600
Let's see where our label is going to be located so that we can optimize it later on.

61
00:05:34.650 --> 00:05:40.770
Let me run this into simulator as you can see that this advantage of this method is that I cannot see

62
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:44.130
it unless I run it in my simulator.

63
00:05:44.130 --> 00:05:53.340
So we have to work with simulator very often in this case if we choose to place our we use place create

64
00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:01.250
our views and labels and buttons on image you use and everything with this methods and later on we're

65
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:07.620
going to see an other method called SWIFT UI but we're going to see it later on because it's kind of

66
00:06:07.620 --> 00:06:12.680
an advanced topic and came to our lives with a U.S. church chain.

67
00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:18.560
It's a very good framework but we have to learn a lot before we move on to that.

68
00:06:18.630 --> 00:06:31.530
So as you can see x 100 y 100 actually brought us here so we have to adjust these values a little bit

69
00:06:31.530 --> 00:06:32.130
more.

70
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:37.340
For example 100 width and 100 Height worked pretty good.

71
00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:48.750
But if I did it like this k then it wouldn't work because I can only see T right now with 10 is actually

72
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:52.330
very small I have to go with hundreds or plus.

73
00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:57.140
So 100 is good for this kind of purpose.

74
00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.880
Okay.

75
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:04.160
So I'm trying to understand what can I do with this with height and X and Y.

76
00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:11.970
But there is a very good way to work with those values but you have to go a little bit mathematical

77
00:07:12.060 --> 00:07:16.110
on this thing but it will work out pretty good.

78
00:07:16.110 --> 00:07:24.360
We will calculate the current screen size within height and make our views according to those values

79
00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:28.080
we get to do that in the next lecture.
