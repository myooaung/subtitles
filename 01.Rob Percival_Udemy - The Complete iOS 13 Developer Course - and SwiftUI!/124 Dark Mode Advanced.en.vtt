00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.130
Hi.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:09.090
We didn't lecture Regan to see how we can handle this style changes in a better way using a built in

3
00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:10.280
function.

4
00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:16.460
Of course there is a built in function for that as you can see we can do it in some sort of way and

5
00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:23.250
we will appear or the load but we have to find a more efficient way in order to do that.

6
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:25.920
And let me show you how it's done.

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.990
It's cold trade style trade collection actually did change.

8
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:40.140
OK so once a user changes some of the trades dysfunction will get cold and we can do the same check

9
00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:42.120
on their dysfunction as well.

10
00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:44.390
So let me copy and paste this.

11
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:54.480
So now when user change is this it will automatically get cold so we will instantly change the color

12
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:58.380
the color of this button or color of whatever we re want.

13
00:00:58.570 --> 00:01:06.450
OK so let me run this and test is as you can see now we are in dark mode and we see the button in white.

14
00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.110
Now let me go back to settings and make it into the light mode.

15
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:16.860
If we go back right now as you can see we see the button in blue form.

16
00:01:17.070 --> 00:01:19.120
Now it's working.

17
00:01:20.010 --> 00:01:25.380
So I believe this is exactly what we wanted right.

18
00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:29.700
So let me test as one more time let me make this into dark mode.

19
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:30.660
And here you go.

20
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:32.510
We have the white button.

21
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:37.200
So this is exactly the behavior that we've wanted.

22
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.470
So you can use this trait collection the change but maybe you're thinking that.

23
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.710
Yeah.

24
00:01:43.710 --> 00:01:45.110
Do I have to do that.

25
00:01:45.110 --> 00:01:50.010
Do I have to bother just thinking about all of this.

26
00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:51.410
Then I build an app.

27
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.140
So what if what if I don't want the users to use my app in dark mode or lights mode.

28
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:07.500
So let's suppose that you build an app and in a specific controller if you take this into a dark mode

29
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:09.690
it would look so bad.

30
00:02:09.690 --> 00:02:16.230
So you don't want users to switch to the dark mode even if they switch to the dark mode.

31
00:02:16.290 --> 00:02:24.310
You don't want it to affect your controller or you don't want to affect it your all whole app.

32
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:27.170
OK so is it possible.

33
00:02:27.190 --> 00:02:27.520
Yep.

34
00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:28.980
This is possible.

35
00:02:28.980 --> 00:02:37.170
So you can ignore these changes and you can actually start your app in dark mode or in light mode as

36
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:38.070
always.

37
00:02:39.120 --> 00:02:40.500
So how it's done.

38
00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:42.330
It's actually very easy.

39
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:50.110
You can override the choice of the user if you want to do that in a specific way you controller.

40
00:02:50.190 --> 00:02:50.880
It's very easy.

41
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:59.100
You can do it with one line but if you want to do that in the whole app then you have to go for info

42
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.160
P lists.

43
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.180
So I'm just going to show you both ways.

44
00:03:03.180 --> 00:03:10.230
So let me come over here to we did loads because I'm just going to do that in this view controller and

45
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:20.520
I'm just going to say override user interface style and the style that I want is dark or light so maybe

46
00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:26.710
I don't want my app or my weave controller to be supporting the dark mode.

47
00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:35.610
So if I override this interface style with lights then regardless of the user's choice I will just show

48
00:03:35.610 --> 00:03:37.060
it in the light mode.

49
00:03:37.230 --> 00:03:43.800
As you can see I mean the dark mode in this phone so my navigation bar actually is in the dark mode

50
00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:49.940
and this second view controller is in the dark mode but this one controller is not.

51
00:03:49.950 --> 00:03:52.470
So let me come over here to settings.

52
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:53.260
OK.

53
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.910
And I just want to make this into light mode.

54
00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.930
And if I go back here.

55
00:03:59.940 --> 00:04:00.450
Here you go.

56
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:04.810
Now I'm in the lights mode in the other we have controller as well.

57
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:08.840
But let me try this one more time if I can.

58
00:04:08.850 --> 00:04:11.990
Let me come over here to dark periods.

59
00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.330
And here you go.

60
00:04:13.350 --> 00:04:21.630
Now I'm not in the dark mode again because I have overridden the user's choice over here so I'm light

61
00:04:21.670 --> 00:04:26.570
mode in the first week controller and dark mode in the second view controller.

62
00:04:26.790 --> 00:04:29.750
But then again the other question may arise.

63
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:34.380
So you may think that you I don't want to support dark mode in the whole app.

64
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:36.000
So what do I do.

65
00:04:36.330 --> 00:04:38.350
Then let me comment then.

66
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:42.060
Then we would be certain this is working properly.

67
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:46.940
Let me go into the NFLPA list and I'm just going to add a new line.

68
00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:49.050
No way to do that.

69
00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:54.410
You just have to go into any line and hit the small button over here.

70
00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:56.360
We have done that before right.

71
00:04:56.430 --> 00:05:04.570
Travel Book section for example v asked her mission to from the user to get their location.

72
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.160
So let me add this.

73
00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:13.410
Let me add the new line and scroll down a little bit so that we can find user interface style.

74
00:05:13.490 --> 00:05:20.560
So we're here after you choose user interface style you can come over here so you'll you go either for

75
00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:28.260
light like that with uppercase owl or dark like death with the uppercase the.

76
00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.000
OK.

77
00:05:29.230 --> 00:05:32.380
So it has it has to be the exactly the same.

78
00:05:32.470 --> 00:05:33.190
OK.

79
00:05:33.190 --> 00:05:35.970
Dark or Light meets upper case.

80
00:05:36.210 --> 00:05:40.470
And if I run this right now as you can see I mean the dark mode.

81
00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:42.880
So let's see if we were in the dark about the up.

82
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:44.530
We were already in the dark mode.

83
00:05:44.530 --> 00:05:47.360
So let me put this into light mode.

84
00:05:47.530 --> 00:05:49.280
If I come over here.

85
00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:50.060
Here you go.

86
00:05:50.060 --> 00:05:55.060
Now I'm in the dark mode even though this phone is in the light mode.

87
00:05:55.090 --> 00:06:01.630
So in order to be certain I am running it from scratch and it's still in the dark mode even though my

88
00:06:01.630 --> 00:06:04.450
phone is in the light mode.

89
00:06:04.510 --> 00:06:08.950
So here you go now you know how to handle these situations.

90
00:06:08.980 --> 00:06:12.610
So again you may think that the I don't want to bother all of this.

91
00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:12.960
OK.

92
00:06:12.970 --> 00:06:17.510
So my adverts perfectly fine with dark mold or light mode.

93
00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:19.560
Do I have to override anything.

94
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:21.070
No you don't.

95
00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.280
But if you want to customize your app depending on the style choice you're more than welcome to do so

96
00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.180
with this functions.

97
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:35.290
If you don't want to support dark mode or light mode in your apps then you're more than welcome to do

98
00:06:35.290 --> 00:06:35.800
so.

99
00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.730
But Apple suggests to go for both ways.

100
00:06:38.730 --> 00:06:45.280
So supporting dark mode and supporting light modes so beared out in mind and try to understand how to

101
00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:47.160
handle these situations.

102
00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:50.730
So let's stop here and continue within the next lecture.
