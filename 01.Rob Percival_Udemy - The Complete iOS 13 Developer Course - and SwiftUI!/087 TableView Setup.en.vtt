00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:08.610
Hi within this lecture we're going to set our table view up so that we can use it in our view controller

2
00:00:08.880 --> 00:00:14.640
and also we're going to find some Simpson images and names and jobs.

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.910
So first of all I suggest you pause the video and do the table view set up on your own.

4
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:27.170
This is going to be exactly the same way that we have done in the landmark book application.

5
00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:32.630
So pulls the video and tried to do it on your own.

6
00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.980
I hope you made it.

7
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.190
If so congratulations.

8
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.240
If you couldn't.

9
00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:39.880
Just don't worry I'm going to show you how it's done.

10
00:00:40.630 --> 00:00:48.490
So remember we had to add the UI table view delegate and UI table view data source in here.

11
00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:56.350
So this will make our real controller at delegates and data source of our table view and this will give

12
00:00:56.350 --> 00:01:02.650
us a chance to reach those functions related to table views.

13
00:01:02.650 --> 00:01:08.770
And remember we have to call two functions in here in order to make this work.

14
00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:15.060
And those are number of rows in section and S4 for row at index path.

15
00:01:15.550 --> 00:01:16.480
OK.

16
00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:20.420
And that's how we set our table view up.

17
00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:28.810
Later on when we create our model we will do the related adjustments so that we can display the data

18
00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:32.680
in table view as well.

19
00:01:32.830 --> 00:01:34.240
So how do we do it.

20
00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.940
Remember we can come over here and say a number of rows in section.

21
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.860
OK so this one double click on this and we'll bring up the function.

22
00:01:44.950 --> 00:01:47.640
And here we have to return the number.

23
00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.620
So this number will be 10 right now.

24
00:01:50.740 --> 00:01:59.280
Later on we're going to adjust it and we have to call for cell for all at index path.

25
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.230
Okay.

26
00:02:00.340 --> 00:02:03.470
That's where we have to return this cell.

27
00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:11.080
So I'm going to create a cell first and in order to create a cell you can just say right left so is

28
00:02:11.080 --> 00:02:13.320
a UI table view cell OK.

29
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:23.930
UI table to use cell and we can just display it taxing here by saying out tax labeled up text is test

30
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.450
our Simpson or Homer Simpson.

31
00:02:26.440 --> 00:02:27.260
Okay.

32
00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:30.510
And then we can return this cell.

33
00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.620
And of course this is going to be adjusted later on according to our race.

34
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:40.620
Right now we are done.

35
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.290
But let us see if this works and this won't work.

36
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:49.950
Maybe you realize that I forgot something.

37
00:02:50.410 --> 00:02:56.790
So let's run and see if this display Homer Simpson ten times.

38
00:02:56.980 --> 00:03:07.420
And as you can see we're just seeing some empty rows because I forgot to make our day table with data

39
00:03:07.420 --> 00:03:14.040
saws and table view delegates to equal to self to weave controller in order to do that.

40
00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:24.400
Come over here and say Say believed that data source is self and table we you dot delegate is again

41
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:25.270
self.

42
00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:32.820
So this will make our controller to day delegate and data source off our table view.

43
00:03:33.520 --> 00:03:39.580
So now if I run this on my simulator I will see Homer Simpson ten times.

44
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:43.930
So this is exactly what we want.

45
00:03:44.020 --> 00:03:52.180
Now it's time to really find some Simpsons and show them in our table view rather than having some test

46
00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:55.690
dummy variables in here.

47
00:03:56.020 --> 00:04:03.610
And even though we're just going to display the names in the tables view we're going to need some images

48
00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.680
and jobs as well.

49
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:13.670
Remember in our details view controller we're going to display the name and the job and the image.

50
00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:22.930
So here comes the boring part we have to go to the Google and find some images and names and jobs.

51
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:26.630
So re going to do that step by step again.

52
00:04:26.710 --> 00:04:33.450
So let me go to Google and you can just search for Simpsons or Simpsons characters.

53
00:04:33.460 --> 00:04:34.310
OK.

54
00:04:34.450 --> 00:04:38.860
So it's not going to be South Park characters.

55
00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.830
It's going to be Simpsons characters.

56
00:04:41.830 --> 00:04:47.890
Of course it doesn't necessarily matter so you can just go for South Park as well.

57
00:04:48.010 --> 00:04:53.700
But I'm going to go for a Simpsons because we made something with South Park right.

58
00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.750
And this is good.

59
00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:57.730
So we're looking something like this.

60
00:04:57.730 --> 00:04:59.850
Something like this image.

61
00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.930
So let me go to this Homer Simpson are out.

62
00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:09.200
I believe there is a Vicky for Simpsons here weakest Simpsons.

63
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:15.970
OK so I'm going to go to this weekend Simpsons so maybe we can get a lot more information regarding

64
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:18.790
two Simpsons like we going to need the job.

65
00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:27.940
But maybe you want to display other features like birth place or I don't know maybe birth day as well.

66
00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.830
So I'm going to save this file.

67
00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:38.140
So let me see Homer Simpson is in my downloads and we can get the jobs and other information here from

68
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:40.180
this Web site as Vo.

69
00:05:40.380 --> 00:05:47.590
If you cannot find this Web site you can just go for Google and just search for Homer Simpson and find

70
00:05:47.860 --> 00:05:49.170
a related image.

71
00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:50.960
So let me search.

72
00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:53.510
Do we have some characters here.

73
00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:55.000
Yeah I believe so.

74
00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:03.190
Let me click on the characters and we have so much characters in the Simpsons.

75
00:06:03.230 --> 00:06:06.300
Yeah I believe Simpson weekly I believe so.

76
00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:09.640
I believe you have to search one by.

77
00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.290
For example we have Bart Simpson over here.

78
00:06:12.400 --> 00:06:20.020
Let me click on that one and this doesn't display the Bart Simpson as I wanted to be.

79
00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:21.360
So yeah.

80
00:06:21.370 --> 00:06:22.660
This this one does.

81
00:06:22.660 --> 00:06:25.360
So let me save this file.

82
00:06:25.390 --> 00:06:25.770
OK.

83
00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:27.910
Let me save it to downloads.

84
00:06:28.090 --> 00:06:30.700
And here we go.

85
00:06:30.700 --> 00:06:35.430
Actually job of Bart Simpson should be just students.

86
00:06:35.440 --> 00:06:40.180
So let's go for other characters and just find the images.

87
00:06:40.180 --> 00:06:42.160
We can't really make up the Japs.

88
00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:44.530
You know we're just doing this for an example.

89
00:06:44.530 --> 00:06:46.720
So let me search for Marge Simpson.

90
00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:47.940
OK.

91
00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:50.180
I'm going to download this.

92
00:06:50.410 --> 00:06:53.680
And let me go for Lisa Simpson.

93
00:06:53.830 --> 00:06:54.790
OK.

94
00:06:54.880 --> 00:06:59.630
Let's go for Lisa and save it to downloads.

95
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:01.200
Let's do one more.

96
00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:04.120
We have Homer Marge Bart and Lisa.

97
00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:06.130
So let's go for the baby.

98
00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:09.840
Her name was Maggie I believe Maggie Simpson.

99
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:17.650
So not this film maybe we should just write it like Maggie with Jenny.

100
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.450
Yeah.

101
00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.780
Maggie Simpson.

102
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:20.250
Yes.

103
00:07:20.250 --> 00:07:22.260
MARGARET Alan Simpson.

104
00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:24.730
I should have done this in Google really.

105
00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:28.810
So the Simpson weekly thing is a nightmare.

106
00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:34.300
So we have five images I believe that's OK for right now.

107
00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:38.230
So let me rename all of them so this is going to be Bart.

108
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:40.320
This is going to be Lisa.

109
00:07:40.390 --> 00:07:42.430
This is going to be Maggie.

110
00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:44.850
And this is March.

111
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:47.530
And finally we have Homer.

112
00:07:47.890 --> 00:07:49.690
So that's good.

113
00:07:49.690 --> 00:07:57.910
And I'm just going to take all of this and I'm going to embed them in my assets folder or here.

114
00:07:57.910 --> 00:07:58.330
OK.

115
00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:01.330
So let me open this drag and drop.

116
00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.140
And here we go.

117
00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:04.300
We are ready.

118
00:08:04.330 --> 00:08:06.220
So what are we going to do.

119
00:08:06.230 --> 00:08:12.730
We're going to create a model we're going to create a Simpson class in which we can have these images

120
00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:17.290
in which we can have the jobs and the names as well.

121
00:08:17.290 --> 00:08:19.180
And we know how to do that right.

122
00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:25.060
Because we just got out of objective oriented programming lectures.

123
00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:31.120
So are we going to stop here and then the next lecture where are you going to do this class of Simpson.
