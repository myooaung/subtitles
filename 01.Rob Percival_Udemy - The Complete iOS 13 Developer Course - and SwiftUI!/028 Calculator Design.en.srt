00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:05,250
Hi I hope you made it on your own in your first assignment.

2
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:12,390
If so congratulations if you got stuck at that point don't worry you're going to learn how to do that

3
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:21,390
you haven't practiced anything so far so don't worry you're just going to see how would stump some creating

4
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:23,130
a new project over here.

5
00:00:23,200 --> 00:00:26,000
I'm going to name Dale simple calculator.

6
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,980
OK and of course I'm going to go swift and then hit next.

7
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:41,250
Then I'm going to create my simple calculator or you can call it the Versed calculator ever as pho and

8
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:43,910
place it on your own folder.

9
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,820
So let me start by designing my app.

10
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:55,170
OK so let me go to mean that sorry over here because we're going to need some text fields and we are

11
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,690
going to need some buttons and labels.

12
00:00:59,070 --> 00:01:04,320
So far we haven't even created the project except our first app.

13
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:12,270
So you may have experienced some difficulties doing all these operations by yourself if you tried to

14
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:14,440
do these assignments.

15
00:01:14,490 --> 00:01:22,740
So how do we drag and drop some views over here maybe you remember you hit your shift Allen comments

16
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:30,470
in your keyboard or you can just click over here to this plus bottom and we going to go for text fields

17
00:01:30,500 --> 00:01:31,280
OK.

18
00:01:31,440 --> 00:01:38,250
So if you just search for text you can take this and put it on your own view.

19
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:43,710
So as you can see it displays around the direct tangle that can contain editable text.

20
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:52,040
It means that users can edit this tax and we can get what's going to be inside of this tax feel either

21
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:52,350
way.

22
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,990
So let me just put it and make it a little bit bigger like this.

23
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,280
So let me zoom in so you can see better ends.

24
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:02,850
Here you go.

25
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:05,740
This is our first text field right.

26
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,170
So let me put it this into the center.

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:18,000
So let me go to attributes pain over here and you don't know the attributes the options of this tax

28
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,330
feel at this moment but let me show you how it's done.

29
00:02:21,450 --> 00:02:23,900
So there is a place holder text here.

30
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:29,910
It means that this while they were I right here we'll be staying as a place holder or like this first

31
00:02:29,910 --> 00:02:30,660
number.

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,650
And if somebody or if user type something over here.

33
00:02:34,650 --> 00:02:36,030
This will be deleted.

34
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:40,110
OK so this is automatically handled by Swift.

35
00:02:40,110 --> 00:02:41,830
So this is the place holder.

36
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,720
If there is a tax it won't show off if there is not a tax.

37
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:46,530
It will show off.

38
00:02:46,530 --> 00:02:49,100
So it's a cool feature.

39
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,010
So let's try to play with this tax feel a little bit.

40
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:56,860
So we have seen why the place holder is right.

41
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,430
But we have other options as well and we don't need to change any of this I'm just trying to make you

42
00:03:02,430 --> 00:03:05,320
comfortable with X called a little bit.

43
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:08,940
So here you see the color you may choose whatever color you want.

44
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,490
So this is going to be your text color.

45
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:14,190
You'll see the alignment you see the farms.

46
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:15,630
You can change the font.

47
00:03:15,950 --> 00:03:16,490
OK.

48
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:27,480
So in here we have some text input traits over here so for example in content type you may choose if

49
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:36,540
you're expecting a name input from the user or if you're expecting a job title from the user or location

50
00:03:36,930 --> 00:03:39,060
or a street address.

51
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,720
And we're not going to do that.

52
00:03:40,750 --> 00:03:49,710
OK I'm just going to go for unspecified but if this text field is specifically put for something you're

53
00:03:49,710 --> 00:03:56,670
more than welcome to choose this for example or organization name for example telephone number.

54
00:03:56,670 --> 00:03:58,130
OK.

55
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:04,800
And we don't need this right now we're just expecting a number from the user.

56
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:05,940
OK.

57
00:04:06,430 --> 00:04:16,770
So I'm going to leave this here on unspecified ands let us see if there is some important trade yet

58
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:18,640
we have this keyboard type.

59
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,660
For example I can't go for default and it will bring the default keyboard.

60
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:24,320
OK.

61
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:32,870
If I choose anything like numbers or here like a number pad user will only see the numbers actually

62
00:04:32,870 --> 00:04:41,310
it makes sense for us to choose in this app because we are just expecting numbers from user but I'm

63
00:04:41,310 --> 00:04:42,430
not going to do that.

64
00:04:42,440 --> 00:04:45,720
I will show you why later on.

65
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:48,170
So for first No that's okay.

66
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:54,170
But I have to copy and paste is in order to create my second numbers so you can do that with comments

67
00:04:54,220 --> 00:04:57,030
see and comment V in your keyboards.

68
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:05,460
So once you copy the text field I can change this place holder to be second number.

69
00:05:05,760 --> 00:05:12,390
And by the way of course I could have dragged another text field from this library as well but I can

70
00:05:12,390 --> 00:05:15,620
just copy and paste so whatever pleases you.

71
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,340
So the next thing I'm gonna need that button right.

72
00:05:19,350 --> 00:05:27,780
Because as you might to remember user w clicking the plus button and it will just some user of us quit

73
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,480
clicking the minus button and it will just subtract.

74
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:33,600
So we're going to do that.

75
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:40,500
I'm just going to copy and paste these four times and I'm going to change the size accordingly.

76
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:47,820
So first form will be some and this form deduction and this one multiplication.

77
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,800
Yeah this one.

78
00:05:50,040 --> 00:05:51,910
And let's see.

79
00:05:51,930 --> 00:05:52,880
Copy and paste.

80
00:05:52,890 --> 00:06:00,260
One more time and this will divide the first number into seconds so that's OK.

81
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,670
So you can choose four of them together and just drag it like this.

82
00:06:05,670 --> 00:06:06,880
Okay.

83
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:12,590
And after all we're done with this I'm going to display the results in a label.

84
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:13,440
OK.

85
00:06:13,710 --> 00:06:19,690
So let me take a label and you remember we just put some tax in labels.

86
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,140
So this is nothing fancy if you want to show a tax.

87
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:25,950
You can use labels.

88
00:06:25,950 --> 00:06:34,320
So let me make this a little bit bigger and put it over here let me just try and make this into center.

89
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:45,000
Yeah that's OK and for label we can just actually make this something like a results OK or we can just

90
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,690
leave this empty as well.

91
00:06:46,710 --> 00:06:55,370
But in order to be clear I'm not going to do that because we cannot even see the label over here.

92
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:58,230
It's the same color as background.

93
00:06:58,230 --> 00:07:01,140
So I'm going to leave this as their results.

94
00:07:02,010 --> 00:07:04,430
So I think that's OK.

95
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:05,660
OK.

96
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:15,630
And you can work with this line break think in order to wrap the result or in order to have two different

97
00:07:15,630 --> 00:07:17,940
lines but it won't fit.

98
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:19,760
But we're not going to go over.

99
00:07:19,750 --> 00:07:24,530
That's right now I'm just going to go for dessert reset to suggest the constraints.

100
00:07:24,540 --> 00:07:31,160
Remember we have to do that in order to make sure our views will stay in their places.

101
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:40,230
When we played them in simulators in actual phones so that they will be displaying similar in different

102
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:41,370
kinds of sizes.

103
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:45,320
So in the next section actually we were going to deep dive onto this.

104
00:07:45,330 --> 00:07:51,720
But for right now you can just click on that and say rear it's head to suggest that constraints and

105
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,930
in fact I believe we're done with our design right.

106
00:07:54,930 --> 00:08:03,870
We got what we need in here so the next step will be the just defining these into coding section and

107
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:11,370
then working with those views in order to reach our goal of doing four basic operations in a reverse

108
00:08:11,370 --> 00:08:12,180
calculator.
