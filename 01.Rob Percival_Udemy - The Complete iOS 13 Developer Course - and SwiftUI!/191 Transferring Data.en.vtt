00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:07.890
Hi within this lecture we're going to pass our information from places where you Controller two details

2
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:14.730
we controller and the information that we're passing to is the place chosen.

3
00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:21.660
The idea of the place chosen because we're getting the name of the location and idea of the location

4
00:00:21.690 --> 00:00:27.780
and where the user taps on that location where you're going to have to pass that I.D. so that we can

5
00:00:27.780 --> 00:00:34.730
use that I.D. to retrieve further information from pass in the details of you controller.

6
00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:42.240
And we're going to use the old way of doing that so we're going to use the prepare for Segway and pass

7
00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:50.520
this information because we're just passing one tiny little bit of data in here which is I.D. of the

8
00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.720
chosen location.

9
00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.800
OK.

10
00:00:52.980 --> 00:00:56.070
So I'm gonna call this preparing for Segway.

11
00:00:56.360 --> 00:00:57.590
OK.

12
00:00:57.720 --> 00:01:05.940
And what we do here is to prepare the Segway but also we have to call the deed select roll as well so

13
00:01:05.940 --> 00:01:09.590
that we know which index was chosen.

14
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:11.180
Right.

15
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:18.000
Of course in order to make this work we need some variables inside our details we have controllers so

16
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:25.970
that we can reach the details we have controller from here and I'm going to call this chosen place.

17
00:01:26.730 --> 00:01:29.590
So chosen place idea actually.

18
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:36.570
This will be a string type object and you can try to make this initialize as an optional string or you

19
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:42.170
can just create an empty string as well because it really doesn't matter.

20
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:49.560
You're going to pass this information from our places we see to here anyway and you have seen the both

21
00:01:49.560 --> 00:01:51.470
ways of doing this so far.

22
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:55.280
So I'm going to go for this empty string OK.

23
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.420
Under places where you controller we going to define our details we controller as a variable I reached

24
00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:08.190
at the information but in order to do that of course we need a Segway.

25
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.350
Right now I believe yep we have our Segway right to details we have controller.

26
00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:15.000
Now we can use it.

27
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:22.510
So underprepared for Segway I'm going to check to see if Segway identifier is actually two details we

28
00:02:22.510 --> 00:02:23.090
see.

29
00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:24.100
Right.

30
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:32.130
If that's the case then I'm going to create my place details we see as a variable.

31
00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.180
So I'm going to say let destination we see.

32
00:02:36.690 --> 00:02:40.440
OK destination we have controller is going to be Segway.

33
00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:45.530
That destination and I'm going to first cast this as my details.

34
00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:53.160
We have controller and then later on I'm going to do a build with command B so that I can reach the

35
00:02:53.160 --> 00:03:00.300
variables of this destination we see and the variable that I'm want to get is the chosen place I.D.

36
00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:05.860
So if I say destination we see Dot I will get to see this chosen place I.D..

37
00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.890
And how will I get this chosen place i.e. I have to create some other variable here so that I can get

38
00:03:13.890 --> 00:03:14.840
it.

39
00:03:14.970 --> 00:03:18.820
So under here I'm going to say selected place I.D..

40
00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:19.910
OK.

41
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:27.910
And this will be an empty string initially but once a user clicks on here I'm going to assign its value.

42
00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:36.750
So come over did select row and I'm going to say select the place I.D. is place idea array index path

43
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:45.780
data row and then later on we're actually going to perform the Segway snuffed out performed Segway here.

44
00:03:45.780 --> 00:03:46.380
OK.

45
00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:49.350
So what was the Segway identifier.

46
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.100
It's two details of easy.

47
00:03:51.270 --> 00:03:52.680
And the sender will be new.

48
00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:54.420
So that's it.

49
00:03:54.420 --> 00:04:02.060
That's how we passed this information in our places model places details we have controller sir.

50
00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:08.660
So here let me try to print this and see if we can get these results.

51
00:04:08.670 --> 00:04:14.250
So let me run this from scratch so that we can run this print statement as well.

52
00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.160
So let me click on this James.

53
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:17.130
And here you go.

54
00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:24.300
Now we see this I.D. So we're going to use that I.D. to get the details from PA server.

55
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:26.820
So let me import the pass in details.

56
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:27.900
We have controller.

57
00:04:28.050 --> 00:04:28.890
OK.

58
00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:33.130
And there we did load rather than just printing out this result.

59
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:40.110
I'm going to have another query in here this time this will be again a P.F. query actually and the class

60
00:04:40.110 --> 00:04:42.840
name is again the places.

61
00:04:42.840 --> 00:04:44.550
This is all good.

62
00:04:44.610 --> 00:04:50.760
But this time I'm going to add and Neil Viki to filter the results.

63
00:04:50.760 --> 00:04:56.550
So I'm going to say query that very key and the key that I'm looking for is place.

64
00:04:56.550 --> 00:04:57.840
I did not place I'd.

65
00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.160
Let's see what this is object I.D..

66
00:05:01.370 --> 00:05:08.350
OK so object I.D. and this will be equal to chosen place I.D..

67
00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.970
So let's try this.

68
00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:16.100
Let's say that Curry dots find objects in background with block OK.

69
00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:23.330
And this will give me an objects and error and if error is not nil of course I'm going to show some

70
00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:30.750
message again later on else I'm going to print out these objects for right now.

71
00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:36.920
Let's see let's see if we can get the James restaurant I.D..

72
00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:41.000
James restaurant details using that idea actually.

73
00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:42.200
Let's click on this.

74
00:05:42.190 --> 00:05:43.970
James restaurant.

75
00:05:43.970 --> 00:05:48.610
And here you go we get the James restaurant details.

76
00:05:48.890 --> 00:05:54.570
Now of course we only have one way alley but it means that this is working right.

77
00:05:54.590 --> 00:05:58.690
Because we have a filter and we have the result back.

78
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:04.490
So it must be working of course at the end of the section we're going to try it.

79
00:06:04.610 --> 00:06:08.960
Try this with another variables another rows and now their values as well.

80
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:15.980
Don't worry but right now we know that this is working and we have to pass this information we have

81
00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:23.900
to actually process this information to show the name the type the atmosphere the image and the coordinates

82
00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.380
to the user.

83
00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.290
Let's do that in the next lecture.
