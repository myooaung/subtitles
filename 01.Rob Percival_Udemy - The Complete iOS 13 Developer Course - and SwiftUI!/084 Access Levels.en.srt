00:00:00,780 --> 00:00:05,730
Hi we this lecture we going to learn about access levels.

2
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,470
So what are those.

3
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,440
They define very we can reach the variable or functions that we have created.

4
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:16,380
OK we have five of them.

5
00:00:16,380 --> 00:00:18,660
It starts with private.

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:21,260
And it goes down to the open.

7
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:25,320
So let me start with the open and public.

8
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:27,680
We don't generally use them.

9
00:00:27,690 --> 00:00:28,260
Why.

10
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:31,500
Because they're not kind of safe to implement.

11
00:00:31,590 --> 00:00:39,750
If you make something you open it means that it can be reached from anywhere in the project and it can

12
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,220
be changed from anywhere in the project.

13
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,440
Public also can be reached from anywhere but they cannot be changed.

14
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:57,690
So why are we not using them and who uses them anyway within the next sections we're going to work with

15
00:00:57,690 --> 00:00:59,490
external libraries.

16
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:08,250
So we're going to just download some software kid development kits as the case to our project for example

17
00:01:08,300 --> 00:01:10,890
order to work with a cloud server.

18
00:01:10,980 --> 00:01:15,390
In the case of fire base we are going to see how we're going to do that.

19
00:01:15,390 --> 00:01:16,820
Don't worry about it.

20
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:23,850
But right now know that we're going to implement and download some project files into our own project

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:32,310
and this file your base developers make their files public so that we can reach them and use them in

22
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,220
our own project.

23
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:43,350
But other than that there is no way there is no actually a logic to implement public and open rather

24
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:50,460
regrowing to Burke private file private and internal mostly so private means.

25
00:01:50,540 --> 00:01:52,000
This is actually private.

26
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,300
This is spatial to the class that we have created in.

27
00:01:56,550 --> 00:02:00,230
It cannot be reached from anywhere else.

28
00:02:00,660 --> 00:02:07,200
So if you're want to make it private then you have to be careful because you cannot reach it from somewhere

29
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:15,150
else and internal is the default one and file private means you get to reach it from the file.

30
00:02:15,150 --> 00:02:22,590
For example you get to reach it from these musicians that swift file not in the class only but from

31
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:24,090
this file.

32
00:02:24,490 --> 00:02:25,250
OK.

33
00:02:25,620 --> 00:02:31,190
So let me make an example because you will understand it much better this way.

34
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,910
For example let me make this function sync private.

35
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:44,700
So if I make this private it means that I can only reach this sync function within my musicians class.

36
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,480
I cannot reach it from anywhere else in my project.

37
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,290
So let's try.

38
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:55,200
Actually I met made this private right.

39
00:02:55,230 --> 00:03:04,440
So can I call this from Maine that's first or can I call this function from other classes or other service

40
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:05,580
files.

41
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:12,480
I cannot do that if I do command B or if I try to run this as you can see it gives me an error and it

42
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:17,350
says that Singh is inaccessible due to private protection levels.

43
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,820
So James cannot sing right now because I made it private.

44
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:30,910
And in the Super musician class also even though I'm inheriting this I cannot reach the function sync.

45
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:39,470
So if I make this private data they cannot call this sync function from anywhere in my project.

46
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:45,850
So it doesn't make sense to make this private because I am inheriting this function.

47
00:03:45,850 --> 00:03:48,890
I am using this function in my objects.

48
00:03:49,320 --> 00:03:58,980
So I believe we should delete this but there will be some cases that you may want to make things private.

49
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:05,160
For example if you tried to come up with a variable inside of your main that swift or inside of your

50
00:04:05,460 --> 00:04:12,090
controller and if you're not going to use that variable inside of this nother class for example you

51
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:16,590
can make it private and you can make it for functions as well.

52
00:04:16,590 --> 00:04:19,240
For example in my musician that Swift.

53
00:04:19,360 --> 00:04:25,510
Let's suppose that I have a test function OK I am just testing something.

54
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:28,190
So I can print out test.

55
00:04:28,200 --> 00:04:34,530
For example let's say that we are again working in a big group.

56
00:04:34,530 --> 00:04:42,960
So I'm duping musician's class and I'm testing something but I don't want anyone to create a musician

57
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:45,750
object and reach the test function.

58
00:04:45,780 --> 00:04:50,430
So as you can see they cannot call test for a main that's fifths.

59
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,720
So let me do a command B as you can see they can call sing but they cannot call tests.

60
00:04:58,050 --> 00:04:59,200
So this is good.

61
00:04:59,310 --> 00:04:59,740
Right.

62
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:07,700
We can make things private if we want to make them really private if we want to use them only within

63
00:05:07,700 --> 00:05:15,410
the current class and we can make it failed private if we want to use it inside of that particular pop

64
00:05:15,470 --> 00:05:16,970
file.

65
00:05:16,970 --> 00:05:23,930
So this is all we want to talk about access levels and this is all we want to talk about object oriented

66
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:24,990
programming.

67
00:05:25,040 --> 00:05:26,520
So Regan gonna stop here.

68
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,840
I mean did the next picture re going to create a model and display all of this information in a real

69
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:33,200
app.
