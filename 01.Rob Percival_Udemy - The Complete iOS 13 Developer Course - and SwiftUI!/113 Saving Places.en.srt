1
00:00:00,830 --> 00:00:01,430
Hi.

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:07,890
We didn't this lecture we going to save all this information into our core data database.

3
00:00:07,890 --> 00:00:10,490
So in order to do that we are going to need a save bottom.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:17,100
We can bring the save button on the bottom of this page or we can just put it on the top of this page

5
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:20,860
on the navigation controller bar like we did before.

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,400
I'm gonna do it on the bottom of this wave controller because it will be more clear like this is step

7
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:26,970
one.

8
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:31,100
The map is step two and step three will be the same bottom.

9
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:38,220
Of course you can do it on the navigation bar as well if you want but I'm gonna go for the bottom of

10
00:00:38,220 --> 00:00:39,880
this page.

11
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:40,390
OK.

12
00:00:40,560 --> 00:00:48,180
So I'm gonna decrease this height a little bit as well this time upwards and I'm going to bring in the

13
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,990
button on the bottom of this view controller so drag and drop bombard them not here but at the bottom

14
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:56,370
here.

15
00:00:56,460 --> 00:01:00,630
So let me zoom in and let me make this a little bit bigger.

16
00:01:00,810 --> 00:01:07,770
So like that and put it in the center of the view controller then we can call it save.

17
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:10,620
So this will be our Save button.

18
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,720
Let me open my assistant editor here and let me call the view controller.

19
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:24,780
Now we're gonna call the same button as an action in here so let me click control and drag and drop

20
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:27,930
over here and call the say Button Clicked.

21
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:28,990
Here you go.

22
00:01:29,010 --> 00:01:30,680
Let me close this down.

23
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,910
And before we go home don't forget to add the constraints.

24
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:41,430
So choose the view controller and come to the bottom and say you reset to suggest it's constraints.

25
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,950
Let's check if everything has constraints.

26
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:45,330
Yes it seems so.

27
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:51,410
So let's run this and see if we have anything suspicious.

28
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:59,220
If we have anything distorted so we can come back and see the constraints but everything seems to be

29
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,060
fine right now so I believe we can move on with this kind of view.

30
00:02:04,140 --> 00:02:08,760
Where you going to get named we're going to get the comment we get we are going to choose the map and

31
00:02:08,760 --> 00:02:15,990
save it and remember when we click on this the keyboard will open in a real app and we have to make

32
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:24,430
sure that we have the necessary code in order to tap anywhere in the view and closed down the keyboard.

33
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:29,850
We have learned how to do that so I'm not going to implement this all over again because I don't want

34
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:34,230
to make this longer than it should be.

35
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:38,700
So in a real app maybe you may want to implement it yourself.

36
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:45,450
So right now I'm going to go to X called Data Model okay and I'm going to add a new entity.

37
00:02:45,450 --> 00:02:52,980
And this time I'm going to call this places or something places or locations I before we called this

38
00:02:52,980 --> 00:03:00,170
paintings and remember the entity name can be changed by clicking in here and saying whatever you want

39
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:07,710
like places and in the attributes where you're going to get the title or the name of the location that

40
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:15,030
we have chosen and then we're going to get a commands and then of course we need to save a latitude

41
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:17,330
and longitude.

42
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:25,050
So let's say title for the name and I'm going to call this it's going to be a string and then we're

43
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,280
going to have a subtitle and this will be string as well.

44
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,790
Later on we're going to get a latitude and longitude.

45
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:35,780
So what will be the type of latitude.

46
00:03:35,790 --> 00:03:37,750
Is it going to be an integer.

47
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:42,620
Of course not because we have decimals on decimals actually matter in this case.

48
00:03:42,660 --> 00:03:44,990
So I'm going to go for a double OK.

49
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,400
We save latitude and longitude as double in here and in the coding section as well.

50
00:03:51,460 --> 00:03:56,610
And we create a latitude variable for example it should be a type of double.

51
00:03:56,610 --> 00:03:59,770
So it's it's the same thing for longitude as well.

52
00:03:59,790 --> 00:04:02,250
Let's choose longitude double.

53
00:04:02,250 --> 00:04:09,340
And for the last one I'm going to go for I.D. and this will be a you you I.D. If you haven't watched

54
00:04:09,340 --> 00:04:15,960
the previous section I suggest you go back and watch because we have discussed why are we using an I.D.

55
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:22,990
what is an universally unique I.D. And how do we leverage those I.D. things in our code.

56
00:04:23,250 --> 00:04:27,600
OK I'm not going to go over that one more time.

57
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,920
So in the same building correct.

58
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,020
Remember we have to use card data.

59
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:33,470
OK.

60
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,530
So I have two important core data and come down to say by then click.

61
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:42,720
And first thing we're going to do where you're going to create the app delegate variables.

62
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:51,840
Remember we have to use app delegates in order to reach and use automatically generated Core Data functions

63
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:53,060
for us.

64
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,250
And then we're going to create this context and then we're going to use that context in order to save

65
00:04:59,260 --> 00:05:02,690
delete are retrieved the values that we want.

66
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:06,100
So I'm going to say let's Abdullah delegate.

67
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:15,860
It's going to dry from UI application dots shared dot delegates and later all I'm going to say let's

68
00:05:15,860 --> 00:05:22,080
context this is going to drive for a map delegate that's persistence container.

69
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:22,760
OK.

70
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:24,180
Doesn't show up.

71
00:05:24,260 --> 00:05:25,880
Let me see you one more time.

72
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,240
So this is going to be persistence container.

73
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:29,500
Yeah.

74
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:36,650
It doesn't show up because I didn't cast this previous value as to be our app delegate.

75
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,020
Remember we have to force cast as app delegate.

76
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,570
Now wi fi say app that I get.

77
00:05:42,710 --> 00:05:43,330
Okay.

78
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:49,140
That now I can see persistent container and then view context.

79
00:05:49,430 --> 00:05:54,970
So I'm going over this very fast as we have done there's like a billion times right now.

80
00:05:55,130 --> 00:06:01,340
I'm not explaining why I'm doing this because we are already seeing how to deal with card data in the

81
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:02,530
previous section.

82
00:06:02,570 --> 00:06:08,270
Again if you haven't watch please go back and watch the previous section or else you wouldn't understand

83
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,160
what I'm doing right now.

84
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,860
So while I'm going to do I'm going to create an variable called new place like we did a new art before.

85
00:06:16,970 --> 00:06:24,500
So I'm going to call this an N S entity description and insert new value he certain you object to my

86
00:06:24,770 --> 00:06:31,250
entity and the entity name that I'm looking for is the places we're going to use this context in order

87
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:35,280
to save and retrieve information here.

88
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:42,410
So next thing is very easy we're going to say new place that set value and we have to provide a value

89
00:06:42,410 --> 00:06:47,260
for some certain keys and keys our period defined for us by eyes.

90
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:54,350
Actually we have defined title subtitle latitude longitude to remember and we can get this title from

91
00:06:54,350 --> 00:07:02,040
named text not text easily and we can get the comments subtitle from common texts right.

92
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:10,670
So this is going to be comment text that's text and the key will be subtitle maybe we should have used

93
00:07:11,270 --> 00:07:18,500
comment to name four keys as well but since we have defined it I'm not going to change it later on the

94
00:07:18,500 --> 00:07:22,510
next thing will be to get the latitude and longitude.

95
00:07:22,610 --> 00:07:28,590
Right now I don't have any variables to reach out and get the latitude and longitude.

96
00:07:28,610 --> 00:07:35,480
So what I'm going to do I'm going to create a chosen latitude and chosen longitude variables and I'm

97
00:07:35,480 --> 00:07:44,090
going to define those variables as doubles and then later on then somebody chooses a coordinate from

98
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:53,060
the map in our app I'm going to get that chosen latitude and longitude from DUI gesture recognizing

99
00:07:53,090 --> 00:07:54,630
that we have created.

100
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:55,980
Okay.

101
00:07:56,030 --> 00:07:58,060
It's fairly easy to do that.

102
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,330
So we have worked with that kind of operation before.

103
00:08:02,420 --> 00:08:05,590
What we want to do we have to come over here.

104
00:08:05,630 --> 00:08:13,160
We already have our touch coordinates so we can get touch cordons that latitude touch cordons that longitude

105
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:21,680
and a sign those values to newly created variables like touch cardinals that longitude latitude as you

106
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,160
can see we can reach those variables.

107
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:35,060
OK so let's create our variables as doubles so let's go to our class and let's say we're going to use

108
00:08:35,060 --> 00:08:37,910
var because we're going to change this after all.

109
00:08:37,910 --> 00:08:41,720
So I'm going to say chosen latitude is at double okay.

110
00:08:41,990 --> 00:08:47,680
And I'm going to say chosen longitude as a double.

111
00:08:47,690 --> 00:08:52,570
So this will be our latitude and longitude variables.

112
00:08:52,880 --> 00:09:02,570
And then in here we can just say chosen latitude is now touch coordinates that's latitude so chosen

113
00:09:02,570 --> 00:09:09,790
longitude that's chosen longitude is actually touch the coordinates that longitude.

114
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,640
So that's perfect that's what we wanted.

115
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:21,050
So we are creating this chosen latitude and longitude from here we're assigning new values under our

116
00:09:21,260 --> 00:09:27,920
chosen location function and when the save button gets clicked we can just put those information into

117
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:29,470
our car data model.

118
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:38,210
Of course I believe in order to be safe maybe you can check for if named taxis is empty if actually

119
00:09:38,460 --> 00:09:46,370
and our notation has been created or not you can have different kinds of check points for that but I'm

120
00:09:46,370 --> 00:09:52,370
not going to go into that kind of operation because we have already seen how to do that before.

121
00:09:52,370 --> 00:09:54,050
Right.

122
00:09:54,290 --> 00:10:03,630
And the last thing to be at is actually the I.D. itself and here we already have created I.D. and the

123
00:10:03,630 --> 00:10:10,970
type will be you you I.D. So it's very easy to do that because X code takes care of this.

124
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:19,110
Then we write you you I.D. OK and it means that we have completed the setting value process.

125
00:10:19,110 --> 00:10:24,630
Now remember we can just say context not save in order to save this into core data.

126
00:10:24,630 --> 00:10:27,210
And then we say that it chose an error.

127
00:10:27,210 --> 00:10:28,590
So we have to do that.

128
00:10:28,590 --> 00:10:36,810
We do try catch structure so do try contexts about say and we going to catch if there is any error.

129
00:10:36,810 --> 00:10:37,570
OK.

130
00:10:37,620 --> 00:10:41,790
So let me cut this from here and paste is in here.

131
00:10:41,790 --> 00:10:47,080
And if we have a problem we're we're going to just print out an error.

132
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:53,190
So if we don't have any problem we're just going to print out success right now.

133
00:10:53,250 --> 00:11:00,300
If we even if this works we don't have any method to see if it works or not because we're not retrieving

134
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,220
the data yet.

135
00:11:01,470 --> 00:11:05,380
So I'm printing out success just to test it.

136
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:06,390
So here you go.

137
00:11:06,390 --> 00:11:11,090
Let me just go zoom in in the Eiffel Tower a little bit.

138
00:11:11,100 --> 00:11:13,320
Are we going to save this.

139
00:11:13,350 --> 00:11:19,590
So when I click over here without giving name and comment it will bring me a new annotation about it

140
00:11:19,590 --> 00:11:24,210
doesn't it won't have any name and comment for this kind of thing.

141
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:31,310
I believe you should check if name Tuck's name Tax that tax is empty comment tax that tax is empty.

142
00:11:31,470 --> 00:11:35,090
But I will assume that you can do it on your own.

143
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:41,130
So I'm going to give this Eiffel Tower and I love Paris here manually and then I'm going to zoom in

144
00:11:41,130 --> 00:11:48,060
a little bit more so I can give it another annotation and it won't matter because every time I add a

145
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:51,690
new annotation the coordinates will get changed.

146
00:11:51,690 --> 00:11:57,110
So why they were I did before won't matter man I add the new one notation.

147
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:01,870
This will change the chosen latitude and chosen longitude.

148
00:12:01,950 --> 00:12:07,350
So I will be saving the latest coordinates that I have chosen in this app.

149
00:12:07,650 --> 00:12:16,710
OK so then you come over here as you might remember chosen latitude and chosen longitude gets near values

150
00:12:16,740 --> 00:12:19,040
every time I click on this.

151
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:25,460
So right now I have my name I have my command and I have my notation.

152
00:12:25,620 --> 00:12:27,500
So I have my coordinates.

153
00:12:27,630 --> 00:12:33,150
And as you can see that I hit save it gets saved on the card data.

154
00:12:33,780 --> 00:12:39,600
So in order to be sure of course we have to implement that fetch request and get the information on

155
00:12:39,600 --> 00:12:42,060
display to the user table view.

156
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:47,360
So let's stop here and we're going to do those things in the following lectures.
