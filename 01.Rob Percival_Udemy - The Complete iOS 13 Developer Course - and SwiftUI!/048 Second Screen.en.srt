00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:01,360
Hi.

2
00:00:01,440 --> 00:00:02,690
We did this lecture.

3
00:00:02,740 --> 00:00:06,710
We're going to see how we can work with more than one screen.

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:11,080
So far we have been working on a single screen apps.

5
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:14,310
We haven't added new we controllers.

6
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:17,850
We haven't added new screens to our apps.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,040
And in this lecture we are going to see how to do that.

8
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:28,740
And this is basically going to show you how to create new wave controllers have to create new Swift

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:35,130
files and connect them together so you can add as many as you want.

10
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:36,810
Then you build an app.

11
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:37,470
OK.

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,740
I'm really going to need that information in the upcoming apps of course.

13
00:00:43,740 --> 00:00:49,080
So choose single view app and I'm going to name this Segway app.

14
00:00:49,230 --> 00:00:56,340
OK so you're going to see what the Segway is but it's basically connection between view controllers

15
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,950
in your swift projects.

16
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:06,510
OK so I'm not going to check in and swift UI or core data over here and I'm going to hit next and I'm

17
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:15,520
going to places under IRS complete and we're just going to go into the main storyboards in order to

18
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,970
add our four new controllers.

19
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:20,170
OK.

20
00:01:20,590 --> 00:01:29,710
So let me go to main sorry Bert over here and we're going to see what we usually see you and me create

21
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:32,870
a project an empty iPhone screen.

22
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:35,320
So let me zoom out a little bit.

23
00:01:35,320 --> 00:01:37,540
So this is our view controller right.

24
00:01:37,540 --> 00:01:39,260
And this is our storyboard.

25
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:48,550
We can have as many as we want in here as many as screens we won and we can actually order the screens.

26
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:56,080
The first will be the second will be this charge will be this hey we're just creating the blueprints

27
00:01:56,170 --> 00:01:59,420
of what we're building here.

28
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:08,380
So can I add a label over here and just make this a little bit bigger because I want to call this first

29
00:02:08,380 --> 00:02:10,540
screen or first view controller.

30
00:02:10,570 --> 00:02:11,470
Okay.

31
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:14,750
Because we're going to be working with more than one.

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:20,380
So I'm just going to differentiate you controllers using labels.

33
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:22,810
So this is first we have controller.

34
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,650
OK.

35
00:02:24,830 --> 00:02:27,430
And let me make this central.

36
00:02:27,430 --> 00:02:29,180
That's great.

37
00:02:29,230 --> 00:02:33,420
So I'm just going to need another one to call second controller.

38
00:02:33,940 --> 00:02:39,020
And how do we add a view controller over here how do we add a second screen.

39
00:02:39,550 --> 00:02:40,700
It's fairly easy.

40
00:02:40,690 --> 00:02:47,110
We're going to use library one more time and we're going to look for a real controller.

41
00:02:47,110 --> 00:02:50,180
So you can just drag and drop this as a view.

42
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:51,610
So here you go.

43
00:02:51,610 --> 00:02:54,460
This is view controller that we are looking for.

44
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:56,020
Just drag and drop here.

45
00:02:56,170 --> 00:03:05,140
So here at this our second screen second view controller so I can just drag and drop whatever I want

46
00:03:05,140 --> 00:03:08,460
to in the screen as all I can use library.

47
00:03:08,470 --> 00:03:13,660
And as you can see in the left hand side I have a different view hierarchy right now.

48
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:21,970
So if I drag it label as you can see I can drag and drop it and I can just design it in a way that I

49
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:27,370
want exactly like I'm doing in the first view controller right.

50
00:03:27,370 --> 00:03:33,280
So let me name the second wave controller and that's OK.

51
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:39,730
So here we go we have first V controller we have second we controller.

52
00:03:39,790 --> 00:03:46,240
Now when I click on does this yellow dot over here in the controller it means that I'm choosing the

53
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:48,220
view controller itself.

54
00:03:48,220 --> 00:03:54,280
And let me add and then another assistant editor over here and choose which controller from here.

55
00:03:54,280 --> 00:04:00,730
And let me go to my first view controller and tried to drag and drop this view and as you can see I

56
00:04:00,730 --> 00:04:01,870
can do it right.

57
00:04:01,870 --> 00:04:05,520
I can call this my label and connect it.

58
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:10,460
So can I connect my second view controller label to here.

59
00:04:10,510 --> 00:04:11,440
So let's try.

60
00:04:11,710 --> 00:04:20,180
Let's see it's control and try to drop it as you can see we can not do that because this view or here.

61
00:04:20,180 --> 00:04:25,480
This view controller is not connected to my view controller.

62
00:04:25,480 --> 00:04:27,130
That's first.

63
00:04:27,130 --> 00:04:32,570
So this controller is actually connected to this swift file.

64
00:04:32,590 --> 00:04:33,440
OK.

65
00:04:33,670 --> 00:04:36,470
And the second one is not connected.

66
00:04:36,790 --> 00:04:43,150
So we can create a new Swift file and assign it to be connected to this view controller right.

67
00:04:44,050 --> 00:04:45,100
And how do we do that.

68
00:04:45,130 --> 00:04:50,750
If you click on this yellow dot one more time you can drag and drop anytime you want.

69
00:04:50,860 --> 00:04:52,420
By the way to a line.

70
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:57,820
This view controllers and it doesn't mean anything but it's good to be aligning this.

71
00:04:57,820 --> 00:05:07,660
So let me create the view controller file first so let me go to file new file and here I'm not going

72
00:05:07,660 --> 00:05:08,920
to go for a third file.

73
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:15,150
I'm going to go for cocoa touch class so we haven't seen them yet.

74
00:05:15,160 --> 00:05:18,810
This is the first time we're seeing it and I'm going to explain what is this.

75
00:05:18,820 --> 00:05:25,900
So basically cocoa touch class is the way to go when you try to create something like we have controller

76
00:05:25,930 --> 00:05:29,860
if you click or here you will see a lot of view type.

77
00:05:29,860 --> 00:05:36,670
So you either you controller table view cell we're going to see what our deals later on but if I want

78
00:05:36,670 --> 00:05:45,760
to create a view every related file you need to go with the cocoa touch class and you need to choose

79
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:52,370
what kind of you you're trying to create let's kind of class you are trying to create from here.

80
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:59,560
And after that of course you can choose whatever name you want just make sure that your subclass is

81
00:05:59,800 --> 00:06:07,570
you either you controller OK and make sure Swift is chosen and for class name we already have a view

82
00:06:07,570 --> 00:06:08,200
controller.

83
00:06:08,200 --> 00:06:11,640
So I'm going to the second wave controller.

84
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:14,370
OK so that's it.

85
00:06:14,370 --> 00:06:22,670
I'm going to create hit next to create this and it will just make sure that this target is selected

86
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:27,250
and it will just put this inside of my project folder.

87
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,370
As you can see now we have another controller file.

88
00:06:31,530 --> 00:06:39,120
So we have another Swift file and we can use the swift file with our newly created weave controller

89
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:39,870
right.

90
00:06:39,870 --> 00:06:48,570
So let me delete this comment lines and let me go to main story about because right now I've created

91
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:51,460
this but does X code.

92
00:06:51,470 --> 00:06:52,250
No.

93
00:06:52,380 --> 00:06:56,230
This is going to be connected to this file right now.

94
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:57,900
Of course not.

95
00:06:57,930 --> 00:07:01,640
I have created this but I didn't connect it.

96
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:06,100
So far maybe I have created five Coco touch classes on file.

97
00:07:06,120 --> 00:07:10,590
We have controllers it's called couldn't know which one is which.

98
00:07:10,590 --> 00:07:13,470
So I need to manually connect.

99
00:07:13,530 --> 00:07:20,380
So again this is you either you controller as you can see because we have chosen to be bound we create

100
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:29,860
a Coco touch class so let's connect it let's use these yellow dots one more time choose we have controller

101
00:07:29,900 --> 00:07:30,610
OK.

102
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:32,730
It has to be view controller itself.

103
00:07:32,730 --> 00:07:41,190
So make sure you touch this yellow button and here I'm going to go for this identity Inspector rather

104
00:07:41,190 --> 00:07:42,580
than attributes Inspector.

105
00:07:42,590 --> 00:07:43,040
Okay.

106
00:07:43,530 --> 00:07:49,920
So if you go to this identity Inspector you will see something called class.

107
00:07:49,920 --> 00:07:57,240
So if you click this dropdown Biden over here you will find the second view controller that we have

108
00:07:57,240 --> 00:07:58,650
created.

109
00:07:58,680 --> 00:08:04,890
So make sure this is selected and make sure when you click on it one more time you will see secondary

110
00:08:05,010 --> 00:08:06,090
controller.

111
00:08:06,090 --> 00:08:12,950
Now this view is connected to the real controller file that we have created.

112
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:14,310
So let me test.

113
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:20,520
Let me go to a second wave controller that swift and let me go to say can we even controller main storyboard

114
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:29,550
and drag and drop as you can see now I can actually create my label here so you can call it my label

115
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:36,140
one more time or you can call it whatever you want because these are completely different swift files.

116
00:08:36,270 --> 00:08:41,070
You can just use the same names or you can just use completely different names.

117
00:08:41,130 --> 00:08:42,970
It doesn't matter.

118
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:51,450
So that's how you create new use but we don't know yet how to connect these two together right.

119
00:08:51,510 --> 00:08:55,610
How to reach second view from the first few.

120
00:08:55,650 --> 00:08:58,920
That's what we're going to do within the next lecture.
