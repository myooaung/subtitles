Hi.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:03.120
Following this lecture.

3
00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:06.340
Where are you going to start building this favorite book app.

4
00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:13.080
As you can see we're listing some favorite bands and favorite movies of our developer.

5
00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:19.560
And as you can see they have their own titles rather than just displaying all the values inside of the

6
00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:20.180
list.

7
00:00:20.190 --> 00:00:22.150
We now have sections.

8
00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:22.960
OK.

9
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.140
And this data comes from structures we are working professionally over here.

10
00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:30.880
We're just not creating some arrays.

11
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.060
We are using models.

12
00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:40.530
And when we hit one of them it will take us to another screen which has some navigation as you can see

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:47.550
so that we can see the details of these models as well like image like a description.

14
00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:49.070
And like a title.

15
00:00:49.530 --> 00:00:55.470
And as you can see it works for all the elements regrowing to create this app where you're going to

16
00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.570
work with models.

17
00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:03.450
We we're going to work with sections we will learn how to navigate between views and we are going to

18
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:07.800
learn a lot regarding swift UI during this process.

19
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:10.020
So if you're ready let's get started.
