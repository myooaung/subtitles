1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:08,280
Hi within this lecture we are going to see how we can create our own views inside often lamented reality

2
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:09,500
project.

3
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:15,690
So in order to do that I'm going to create a new X code project because eventually we are going to create

4
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,840
our own solar planet app.

5
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,000
In this project as well so I'm not going to use the old one.

6
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,990
I'm just going to create a new one.

7
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,650
Okay.

8
00:00:25,860 --> 00:00:32,040
So come over here to create a new project and make sure you select augmented reality app.

9
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,360
One more time and this will be our solar system app.

10
00:00:36,690 --> 00:00:44,100
So I'm going to name the solar system a market and make sure seen KID IS SELECTED THIS TECHNOLOGY AND

11
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,010
I'M GOING TO PLACE IS UNDER MY AOS app folder.

12
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:48,930
So here you go.

13
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:57,900
Now our app is created so let me bring this up and let me make this into a full screen mode.

14
00:00:58,040 --> 00:01:03,800
So let me come over to my real controller and I'm going to delete everything because we're going to

15
00:01:03,800 --> 00:01:05,720
create everything from scratch.

16
00:01:06,260 --> 00:01:09,140
So let me get rid of this as well.

17
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:15,650
All we had to do is just leave the scene with that delegate to solve in the we did load because we are

18
00:01:15,650 --> 00:01:20,990
going to create all the Cs nodes and everything in here.

19
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:27,950
So first of all we're going to see what the node is and we're going to see how we can add our nodes

20
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:29,730
to the scene we use.

21
00:01:29,750 --> 00:01:35,380
And of course in order to create nodes we have to create other objects as well.

22
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:40,310
As I said before nodes by themselves do not do much.

23
00:01:40,340 --> 00:01:44,160
They just actually specify the coordinates.

24
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:48,450
The materials that we're using inside of our seat.

25
00:01:49,250 --> 00:01:57,800
So as you can see fire right ACM I can see there are some options like ACM bucks ACARS fear and other

26
00:01:57,800 --> 00:01:58,560
things as well.

27
00:01:58,570 --> 00:02:00,950
We're going to work with all of this things.

28
00:02:01,670 --> 00:02:05,450
So first of all I'm going to create an ACM bucks.

29
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:07,000
So this is a view.

30
00:02:07,010 --> 00:02:15,140
This is and box view that we can create and as you can see it has some width and height and length and

31
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:22,400
on as the fourth parameter we have some radius as well maybe you can think that this isn't even a sphere

32
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:24,260
why we have.

33
00:02:24,530 --> 00:02:26,790
Why do we have a radius over here.

34
00:02:26,870 --> 00:02:31,960
But in fact ACM bucks is not a rectangle or a cube by itself.

35
00:02:31,970 --> 00:02:38,300
It can be a polygon all think so that we can have more than 4 dimension over here.

36
00:02:38,990 --> 00:02:46,760
Okay so for width I'm going to go with 0 point 1 and for height and length I will do the same thing

37
00:02:47,090 --> 00:02:53,660
and for radius I'm not going to go for something big I'm just going to go for all point 0 1 and remember

38
00:02:53,930 --> 00:02:56,390
all these measures are in meters.

39
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,380
So don't go crazy in here you have to specify something less than one meter most of the time.

40
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:09,270
OK I'm going to assign this to be a variable called my box.

41
00:03:09,410 --> 00:03:12,110
So this will be my box.

42
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:18,730
You have to do that I have to specify the texture the material that this box will have.

43
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:26,420
So if you say my box starting materials as you can see it asks us to create an ACM material array in

44
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:35,390
which we define the contents of this box and I'm going to say this will be equal to some array but in

45
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:39,710
order to do that of course I have to create that material first.

46
00:03:39,740 --> 00:03:46,120
So let me create this and I'm going to call this something like Box material okay.

47
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:49,280
And of course you can call it whatever you want.

48
00:03:49,610 --> 00:03:55,190
After that it will be an ACM material like this.

49
00:03:55,190 --> 00:03:57,740
And this will be not sufficient.

50
00:03:57,740 --> 00:04:03,290
Of course if you have to specify the texture or image that this material will take.

51
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:08,400
But eventually we will come down to here and say this will be box material.

52
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:08,780
OK.

53
00:04:08,800 --> 00:04:17,420
Inside of an array just like it asks later on we can specify the image that this material will take.

54
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,230
So in order to do that let us find some images let us find some textures that we can use.

55
00:04:24,260 --> 00:04:29,700
So I'm going to go over to this open game art that's or one more time.

56
00:04:29,700 --> 00:04:34,340
Remember that's what we used in the sprite kid section as well.

57
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:37,910
So we have some free images over here to use it.

58
00:04:37,940 --> 00:04:44,510
Use them in our games in our augmented reality apps and in other apps as well.

59
00:04:44,510 --> 00:04:49,480
For example we can see the 3D art we can see the textures over here.

60
00:04:49,700 --> 00:04:57,500
So I'm going to create a box and I want to wrap this box with some texture and I will just look around

61
00:04:57,500 --> 00:05:00,050
over here to find a good texture.

62
00:05:00,150 --> 00:05:02,300
I'm just doing this randomly.

63
00:05:02,810 --> 00:05:06,140
So you can try with other textures as well.

64
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:09,950
For example I see a wood texture over here.

65
00:05:09,950 --> 00:05:12,820
It would be good to wrap my box around.

66
00:05:12,850 --> 00:05:20,190
So let me open this in another tab and I will continue to find other textures textures as well.

67
00:05:20,210 --> 00:05:23,010
For example we have something over here.

68
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:28,280
It kind of looks like a vol that I don't believe it's good.

69
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,740
So I'm moving over Yeah I see a grass over here so it may be interesting.

70
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,710
So let me open it as well.

71
00:05:35,990 --> 00:05:39,120
And over here I see some ball.

72
00:05:39,290 --> 00:05:41,090
I'm going to take this as well.

73
00:05:41,090 --> 00:05:47,600
So if you don't want to do the steps you can just take them out of my github a counter as well but I

74
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,510
will download those and I will try them one by OK.

75
00:05:52,750 --> 00:05:59,930
So let me take this grass and I believe we have a lot of grass options alternatives over here.

76
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:06,580
It doesn't matter let me just download it and we have two walls over here I'm going to go for the first

77
00:06:06,580 --> 00:06:07,230
one.

78
00:06:07,390 --> 00:06:10,370
So let me download this as well.

79
00:06:10,390 --> 00:06:11,520
And here you go.

80
00:06:11,530 --> 00:06:12,510
Now we're ready.

81
00:06:12,520 --> 00:06:20,080
Let me open my downloads folder and I'm going to create a new folder called A R kit visuals and I'm

82
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,080
going to bring all of these images inside of my folder so that we can see it better.

83
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:34,300
OK so under this folder now I have a zipped file I'm going to open this with archive utility or any

84
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:37,960
other unzipping software that you have.

85
00:06:38,020 --> 00:06:42,370
For example we have different kinds of grasses over here.

86
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:43,140
OK.

87
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:45,190
So let me name this wall.

88
00:06:45,190 --> 00:06:50,310
Let me name this wood and let me choose the grass from this list.

89
00:06:50,470 --> 00:06:52,750
And yep I believe this is good.

90
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,720
Let me name this grass and we bring.

91
00:06:56,060 --> 00:07:01,170
We're going to bring them in to our art that the SAT's folder.

92
00:07:01,810 --> 00:07:06,590
So let me choose everything from here and bring them in like this.

93
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:07,400
OK.

94
00:07:07,410 --> 00:07:07,930
Great.

95
00:07:07,930 --> 00:07:15,190
Now we're going to use those visuals in order to wrap our box around.

96
00:07:15,190 --> 00:07:20,410
So way to do that is to give this as a content to our materials.

97
00:07:20,410 --> 00:07:26,830
So you have to come over here and say box material that diffuse and if you say diffuse you get to change

98
00:07:26,830 --> 00:07:28,800
the content of this material.

99
00:07:28,810 --> 00:07:29,500
Okay.

100
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:35,460
So after that you can say contents like this and it will ask you any objects.

101
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:45,200
And I'm going to give it a UI image object and it will have the name of our newly brought involved up

102
00:07:45,200 --> 00:07:53,680
PMG or other things but we cannot come over here and say Waldock PMG we have to say art that is an asset.

103
00:07:53,720 --> 00:07:56,130
So whatever we see over here.

104
00:07:56,130 --> 00:08:00,170
So it has to be exactly the same as it is.

105
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:00,610
Okay.

106
00:08:00,610 --> 00:08:08,110
And then a slash and then something like Waldock PSG say if you're doing this with another visual then

107
00:08:08,110 --> 00:08:14,800
you're more than welcome to do so but you have to specify art that a CNS it's folder first.

108
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:22,510
And after that we are going to create our node because we want to specify the position that this box

109
00:08:22,510 --> 00:08:24,130
will take in our scene.

110
00:08:24,640 --> 00:08:26,780
So it will be an ACM note.

111
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:29,430
And this note will have a position.

112
00:08:29,620 --> 00:08:35,950
And if you're right position like this you can see that this asks for an ICM vector 3d dimension.

113
00:08:36,040 --> 00:08:36,840
OK.

114
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:38,630
So let's choose this.

115
00:08:38,710 --> 00:08:45,270
And if you open parentheses you will see that it asks you to give some x y and z coordinates.

116
00:08:45,370 --> 00:08:50,250
Again I'm going to give 0 4 x and 0 point one for Y.

117
00:08:50,260 --> 00:08:53,520
So it will be 100 centimeters above us.

118
00:08:53,710 --> 00:08:56,590
And I'm going to say minus 0 point 5.

119
00:08:56,620 --> 00:09:00,950
So it will be 500 centimeters away from us.

120
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,140
OK.

121
00:09:02,150 --> 00:09:07,190
After that we are now ready to add this to our scene view actually.

122
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:16,230
But let me give this geometry first because we have to connect our node with our ACM box.

123
00:09:16,330 --> 00:09:18,570
So that's the way to do it.

124
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:24,300
Now I can come over here and say seeing view that's seen Dodd's root note.

125
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:25,090
OK.

126
00:09:25,150 --> 00:09:26,770
So remember the root node.

127
00:09:26,830 --> 00:09:33,520
That's how we add Charles to the root node so Ed child node and this will be the node so that's why

128
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:40,630
we have done this for loop before in the previous lecture remember I told you you will understand it

129
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:42,400
much better once we do that.

130
00:09:42,520 --> 00:09:44,310
And now you see why.

131
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:51,070
Because we can reach all the nodes each side of the scene with that loop that we have done in the previous

132
00:09:51,070 --> 00:09:52,060
lecture.

133
00:09:52,060 --> 00:10:01,600
So let's run this on our fold so that we can see how we rolled up PSG we look like in our living room.

134
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,380
So let me run this.

135
00:10:03,490 --> 00:10:05,390
And here you go.

136
00:10:05,410 --> 00:10:08,710
So I'm going to bring in my phone to my screen.

137
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:09,760
OK.

138
00:10:09,820 --> 00:10:15,220
And once I open the app you will see the Bucks wrapped around the world up PSG.

139
00:10:15,250 --> 00:10:16,480
And here you go.

140
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,030
Now we can see every aspect of this.

141
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:24,370
And as you can see it's looking good right.

142
00:10:24,370 --> 00:10:25,230
It's a cube.

143
00:10:25,660 --> 00:10:29,330
And it has the world that PSG wrapped around.

144
00:10:29,470 --> 00:10:31,710
Now I believe we can test this video.

145
00:10:31,840 --> 00:10:34,180
Other visuals as well.

146
00:10:34,180 --> 00:10:36,900
For example let's go for the grass.

147
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:44,380
OK so let me run this one more time to see grassed up PSG wrapped around my bucks.

148
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:48,520
So let's run this with our phones again.

149
00:10:48,520 --> 00:10:54,420
So here you go build succeed it's and once we open it we will see the grass.

150
00:10:54,430 --> 00:10:54,730
Yeah.

151
00:10:54,760 --> 00:11:02,890
It doesn't look good because this image is not very suitable for our bucks I believe but this is working

152
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:04,740
well at least yeah.

153
00:11:05,530 --> 00:11:08,930
So let me test this with other visual as well.

154
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:14,390
I believe it's called Wood but wood that JP rather than PMG.

155
00:11:14,530 --> 00:11:17,350
So make sure you change the extension as well.

156
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:19,030
So once we do that.

157
00:11:19,030 --> 00:11:19,630
Here you go.

158
00:11:19,660 --> 00:11:21,470
Now this is better.

159
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:25,810
So this is a cube wrapped around with wood that JP.

160
00:11:26,710 --> 00:11:30,870
So as you can see we can bring in our own wheels.

161
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:35,650
We can create the we use we can set some materials and contents.

162
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:41,140
We can assign them together to show them in our A C so that's cool.

163
00:11:41,380 --> 00:11:47,290
So let's stop here and within the next lecture we're going to create a sphere rather than a box and

164
00:11:47,290 --> 00:11:53,140
we will wrap this sphere with our contents so that we can see how it looks like.
