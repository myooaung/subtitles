00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:00.540
Hi.

2
00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.260
We didn't lecture regrouping to send our first manual push notification using one signal dashboard.

3
00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:12.180
So now we have everything we need in our app.

4
00:00:12.180 --> 00:00:16.750
We have configured our app to be capable of sending push notifications.

5
00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:18.190
And now we're ready.

6
00:00:18.990 --> 00:00:23.250
So in order to test this we have to use a real iPhone device.

7
00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:24.780
As I said before.

8
00:00:24.990 --> 00:00:31.950
So as you can see there is this final option to install the SDK zombie I've already done that.

9
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:37.370
And here you will see a box saying that you have to check this out scribed users.

10
00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:40.640
So it's kind of optional but it's nice to do that.

11
00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:43.440
So what does it mean to be subscribed.

12
00:00:43.680 --> 00:00:51.570
So when you accept some push notification service from some app you get subscribed to the push notifications

13
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.440
of that particular app.

14
00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:55.530
So it's kind of a YouTube.

15
00:00:55.530 --> 00:01:02.730
So you subscribe to that app you subscribe to the push notifications and the developer in this case

16
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:11.220
v will publish some apps for some push notifications and you will receive that push notifications once

17
00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:12.330
we publish.

18
00:01:12.330 --> 00:01:12.740
OK.

19
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.740
So this is kind of a publisher's subscriber relationship.

20
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.650
So let me come over here and plug my iPhone.

21
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:30.000
OK with USP and as you can see it appears over here so that I can choose it and I can run it on my phone.

22
00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.450
And also I'm going to bring in my phone using quick time players so that you can actually track what's

23
00:01:36.450 --> 00:01:38.820
going on inside my phone as well.

24
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:46.260
And the app this is my dog and it will take some time because we are doing this for the very first time

25
00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:51.710
and it's actually building a lot of tasks as you can see.

26
00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:58.410
Now we have run this in our simulator before but it's the first time that we're running this on our

27
00:01:58.410 --> 00:01:58.980
phone.

28
00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:05.430
So it may take some time so feel free to pose the video and come back when it's done.

29
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.340
So after it's done I'm going to open my app and it's going to ask me for a push notification per mission

30
00:02:12.570 --> 00:02:20.730
as you can see once I see the app running on my phone it asks me for a permission.

31
00:02:20.820 --> 00:02:28.890
So once I hit the yellow button on my phone I will get subscribed to the push notifications.

32
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:31.820
And in fact I can see them over.

33
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.980
I did one signal dashboard.

34
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:34.820
OK.

35
00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:43.260
So once you do that you can go back to your want signal and try to see if this is logged in or not.

36
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.460
So let me log in by the way with James in my phone.

37
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:50.870
So James that's Metallica dot com.

38
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.870
OK.

39
00:02:52.910 --> 00:02:54.360
And yeah.

40
00:02:54.780 --> 00:03:01.300
It's seeking a little bit time as you can see because I'm really typing on my phone rather than my simulator

41
00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.240
over here.

42
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:07.530
So I'm going to click on this sign in button and it will just take me inside of my app.

43
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:13.660
And as you can see now I'm seeing everything that we have built in the previous section.

44
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:18.180
Now I can come over here to upload something and so.

45
00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:24.420
Now let me go back because we are not interested in the Instagram features right now but we are interested

46
00:03:24.510 --> 00:03:26.610
in the push notification features.

47
00:03:27.870 --> 00:03:34.190
So it's time to test if we can I V cooled subscribe or not.

48
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:41.430
OK you can do that over the first screen that we have seen over here.

49
00:03:41.510 --> 00:03:45.910
And if you have closed this for some reason I will show you have to do that.

50
00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:53.960
And as you can see once I say check subscribed users it couldn't find the subscribe to users even though

51
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.710
I am sure I have given the permission to do so.

52
00:03:57.710 --> 00:04:04.550
So if you didn't get this error if you have seen Yep successful you have one subscribed user then it's

53
00:04:04.580 --> 00:04:05.510
okay for you.

54
00:04:05.780 --> 00:04:13.640
But if you didn't see it if you didn't see and subscribed users like me I will show you how to handle

55
00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:14.470
this.

56
00:04:14.570 --> 00:04:20.600
So I'm going to come over here and I'm just going to say check subscribed users one more time and it's

57
00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:22.950
clearly not working for me.

58
00:04:23.060 --> 00:04:30.560
So I'm going to leave the set up and I'm going to go into my dashboard and in here this is the dashboard

59
00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.390
of my insta clone firebase.

60
00:04:32.390 --> 00:04:39.260
You can just click on the app name and if you come into the main dashboard for some reason you can click

61
00:04:39.260 --> 00:04:44.270
your app name as well in order to reach your apps dashboard.

62
00:04:44.270 --> 00:04:49.660
And here you will see we really don't have any subscribed users.

63
00:04:49.850 --> 00:04:54.850
So we have only zero subscribed users so it clearly doesn't work.

64
00:04:55.400 --> 00:05:03.320
So I'm going to update my paths I'm going to update my repository so that if there is any change in

65
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:10.790
the paths and so that I can just update it and I can use the latest version and you can come across

66
00:05:10.790 --> 00:05:15.530
with this kind of problems especially when it's transitional periods like this.

67
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:23.630
So now we're moving into I.S. 13 and I believe there is some sort of bug but we're going to come over

68
00:05:24.290 --> 00:05:25.070
this problem.

69
00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:30.920
So I'm going into my IRS complete folder to find my e quantify your base.

70
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:39.290
So I'm going to Rampart update over here or you can't run path install repo updates.

71
00:05:39.370 --> 00:05:39.970
OK.

72
00:05:40.070 --> 00:05:48.050
So this will update your pots and if it doesn't work for you again please run pod install repo update

73
00:05:48.320 --> 00:05:57.200
like this so that it will update your pods it will update your current project folders and again please

74
00:05:57.200 --> 00:06:04.910
make sure you select the latest version you see over here rather than using mine so that you won't be

75
00:06:05.210 --> 00:06:07.880
using an outdated version.

76
00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.240
So if the codes changed by time of course I'm going to update this lesson anyway.

77
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:22.420
But if it doesn't change you have to use the latest version in order to ensure stability in your app.

78
00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:31.010
So after this is completed I'm going to delete my application from my iPhone because I'm going to install

79
00:06:31.010 --> 00:06:35.150
it one more time and it will ask me to give some permissions.

80
00:06:35.270 --> 00:06:40.220
And once I do that I will see if this is subscribed or not.

81
00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:41.060
So here you go.

82
00:06:41.060 --> 00:06:43.040
Now it's updated 4B.

83
00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:52.430
So let me plug in my iPhone and after you delete the existing app from your phone you can just try to

84
00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:54.020
run this one more time.

85
00:06:54.650 --> 00:07:03.740
So let me run this OK and let me go back to my phone to see it and I believe it's going to be fast this

86
00:07:03.740 --> 00:07:09.580
time because we have already built this but we have updated the pods as well.

87
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:11.430
So I'm not sure yet.

88
00:07:11.510 --> 00:07:15.860
It's building from scratch so it's going to take some time again.

89
00:07:15.980 --> 00:07:22.010
But these things happen when you develop your big applications.

90
00:07:22.010 --> 00:07:29.380
So this kind of a big project we have firebase we have one signal we have some social media features

91
00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:31.460
push notifications features.

92
00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:38.910
So it's common for us to wait for this to be build up occasionally.

93
00:07:38.930 --> 00:07:39.380
OK.

94
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:48.050
So after this is done you're going to be displayed with this push notification permission one more time

95
00:07:48.220 --> 00:07:50.070
and I am going to allow this.

96
00:07:50.090 --> 00:07:50.770
OK.

97
00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:55.550
And let's see if we get this subscribed user right now.

98
00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:04.520
So let me go back to my I want signal dashboard and what we want to do is to refresh the page to see

99
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.480
if subscribed users is one right now.

100
00:08:08.510 --> 00:08:09.400
So here we go.

101
00:08:09.410 --> 00:08:12.230
Now it's subscribed and it's working.

102
00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:18.620
So now I can receive push notifications in my actual iPhone.

103
00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:22.070
So here you will see a send the push message.

104
00:08:22.070 --> 00:08:22.490
Come on.

105
00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:23.000
Action.

106
00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.770
So it's under common actions.

107
00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:30.010
So if you cannot see it you can find it from the menu as well as you can see there.

108
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:37.580
There is a message as menu over here and you can come over to that and you can just say need push in

109
00:08:37.580 --> 00:08:40.280
order to create a push from dashboard.

110
00:08:40.490 --> 00:08:47.030
So this is very you can send a push message to all of your users manually by manually.

111
00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:51.950
I mean you get to write the title you get to write the message and everything.

112
00:08:52.010 --> 00:08:54.480
And by automatic I mean right.

113
00:08:54.500 --> 00:09:00.670
Sending it inside of X code so you can send it to all subscribed users.

114
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:04.610
And I'm going to give some test titles over here okay.

115
00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:09.570
And we will see how it will look like on our form on the right hand side.

116
00:09:09.590 --> 00:09:17.570
For example I can just write my first push in my title and let's write something in the subtitle like

117
00:09:17.570 --> 00:09:20.270
a test like my insta clone.

118
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:21.020
Okay.

119
00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:25.360
And in the message by the I'm going to just say test test test test.

120
00:09:25.490 --> 00:09:26.270
And here you go.

121
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:31.700
Now we see how this will look like and you will see some other options over here.

122
00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.210
So for example badge counts.

123
00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:36.850
So what is a badge count.

124
00:09:36.890 --> 00:09:40.910
So this indicates how many notifications you have.

125
00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.460
So let me show you some badge count up representation.

126
00:09:45.470 --> 00:09:51.130
So like this the seven is the badge count of my e application.

127
00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:51.680
OK.

128
00:09:51.740 --> 00:09:55.250
So I have unread seven notifications.

129
00:09:55.520 --> 00:10:02.280
So if you increase it by one it will display one in our app later on.

130
00:10:02.330 --> 00:10:04.430
You will see a sound option here.

131
00:10:04.430 --> 00:10:11.990
So if you want to do a sound file to push notifications which is not very suggested which is not very

132
00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:15.530
encouraged by Apple but you can use it if you want.

133
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:23.360
And in here you can provide the media like your URL or an image to the to be displayed in the push notifications.

134
00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:31.100
And under here you can schedule your push notifications as well you can just send them at a particular

135
00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:35.300
time if you want or you can just send them immediately.

136
00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:41.780
Now I'm going to confirm this and I'm going to send this message as you can see we have only one recipient

137
00:10:42.080 --> 00:10:43.220
in this case.

138
00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:50.660
And once I sent that let me open my phone and you will see we have this push notifications here you

139
00:10:50.660 --> 00:10:51.190
go.

140
00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:57.250
My first push my is the clone and we have this test test test.

141
00:10:57.320 --> 00:11:03.340
Now if I hit on that push notification it will just take me to our app.

142
00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:08.320
So let me open this with face recognition and let me try to click on that.

143
00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:09.390
And here you go.

144
00:11:09.410 --> 00:11:12.400
Now we are inside of our app.

145
00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.020
So this is very cool.

146
00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:20.840
Now we have seen how to send notifications and how to receive them.

147
00:11:20.870 --> 00:11:27.320
And we're here in the messages section you can actually track the statistics of your push notifications

148
00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:28.000
as well.

149
00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:35.600
For example if you're working with a really big application you can just send the message and under

150
00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:38.960
deliver a tab you can just see the statistics.

151
00:11:38.990 --> 00:11:46.850
And in the users tab you can see all the users as you can see you can actually categorize or segmented

152
00:11:46.850 --> 00:11:49.210
by the users as you want.

153
00:11:49.220 --> 00:11:56.780
For example you can have a gender segmentation or you can have an active or none active segmentation.

154
00:11:56.780 --> 00:12:05.300
You can just try to come up with other segmentation as well and you can just sense some push notifications

155
00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:08.180
to only one segment at one time.

156
00:12:08.600 --> 00:12:14.300
So it's kind of a serum tool for your customer relationship management tool for you as well.

157
00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:19.720
And in the all users tab you will see all subscribed to users.

158
00:12:19.850 --> 00:12:24.580
For example this is our current form and we have this play your I.D..

159
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:33.860
So this is a unique I.D. that is specific to our subscribe to users every going to use that player I.D.

160
00:12:33.890 --> 00:12:39.140
in order to send push notifications to a specific user later on.

161
00:12:39.950 --> 00:12:45.380
So we're going to stop here and within the next lecture we're going to deep dive into this play your

162
00:12:45.380 --> 00:12:46.190
I.D. think.
