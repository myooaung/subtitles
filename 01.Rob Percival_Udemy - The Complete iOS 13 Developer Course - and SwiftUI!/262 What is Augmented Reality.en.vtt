00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi.

2
00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:07.710
We didn't the section we're going to focus on augmented reality and we're going to use a market for

3
00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:08.610
that.

4
00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.960
So maybe you wonder what is augmented reality.

5
00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:18.630
So this is a way to bring in the virtual life into our rooms by using the camera.

6
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:27.270
If I were from so as you can see this kid actually gives us opportunity to create user experiences that

7
00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:35.370
add to these or treaty visuals 3D elements to the live view from my device camera.

8
00:00:35.370 --> 00:00:43.410
So for example we can create a spaceship or we can create a Star Wars Death Star or we can create some

9
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:47.040
image to show it in our live camera.

10
00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:47.710
OK.

11
00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:55.740
So that we will think that this image this object is actually sitting inside of our living room.

12
00:00:56.070 --> 00:00:58.470
So this is like a PokÃ©mon Go game.

13
00:00:58.680 --> 00:00:59.120
OK.

14
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:06.990
So if we beings bring virtual things into our real life by using these augmented reality and I really

15
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:13.590
suggest you come around and take a look at the arcade documentation after you complete the section because

16
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.480
there are a lot of features which you may want to learn later on but now I'm just going to close this

17
00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:28.170
down and I'm going to create our projects so that we can start learning about a augmented reality.

18
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:33.750
And as you can see I'm not going to go for a single view at this time but rather I'm just going to choose

19
00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:38.860
the augmented reality app and this will create the framework for us.

20
00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:41.210
So after you choose it here next.

21
00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:44.870
And as you can see we have some different options over here.

22
00:01:44.910 --> 00:01:48.630
I'm going to call this a market first project OK.

23
00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.290
We're going to learn about the basics in this lecture any here we have some options.

24
00:01:54.330 --> 00:01:58.630
In fact we have seen these options before when we work with Sprite kids.

25
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:06.420
And as you might already remember medal is for hard core training hardcore creating game old engines.

26
00:02:06.570 --> 00:02:15.410
Then you really work with graphic car units OK graphical processor and the sprite kid.

27
00:02:15.420 --> 00:02:22.470
We have heard before it's for creating to these games or to these scenes and seeing kit is for 3d scenes

28
00:02:22.710 --> 00:02:30.450
and reality kit is actually it is to create is created to work with augmented reality in which you can

29
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:37.400
create some 3D apps like AI if you want to play a bowling game inside of your living room.

30
00:02:37.470 --> 00:02:39.730
You can do that with the reality kit.

31
00:02:39.900 --> 00:02:46.440
But in this section where you're going to focus on seeing kit because it provides us very good tools

32
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:49.430
to learn about the essentials the basics.

33
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.600
These are most fundamental things about augmented reality.

34
00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:59.460
So I'm going to go with sink it and we're going to work with 3D objects.

35
00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:02.710
OK so that's what we're going to do.

36
00:03:02.730 --> 00:03:11.280
In fact after we complete some of the introductory lectures we're going to create a 3D planets and solar

37
00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:13.380
system inside of our living room.

38
00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.300
So this is going to be fun.

39
00:03:15.750 --> 00:03:24.900
So let me create this OK and let me make this into a big full screen and maybe you realize there are

40
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:31.530
some differences in our project and I'm going to explain what our Joes don't vary but I just want to

41
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:34.710
take note over here to show you something.

42
00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:35.490
OK.

43
00:03:35.510 --> 00:03:38.160
So let me come over to our real controller.

44
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.560
I'm going to tell you what are those later on.

45
00:03:40.560 --> 00:03:41.460
Don't worry.

46
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:45.360
Just right now I just want to tell you about an a nine chip.

47
00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:53.180
So you need an eight nine chip in your phone in order to efficiently work with augmented reality apps.

48
00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:56.580
And this is included in iPhone s and both.

49
00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.230
OK.

50
00:03:57.270 --> 00:04:05.390
So if you don't have any phone that his iPhone 6 S and a bow then you may not be able to work this work.

51
00:04:05.430 --> 00:04:11.760
This projects with your phone because obviously we're going to use our phones we're going to plug our

52
00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:19.070
phones with USP to connect them to the X code because we will be using our cameras in the section.

53
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:25.850
But if you don't have one of these phones then it may not work for you because you need a nine chip.

54
00:04:26.010 --> 00:04:28.320
And I'm going to explain why do you need.

55
00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:35.310
Does a nine chip later on but just know that you have to have an iPhone and you have to connect it to

56
00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:41.460
your X code and you have to have an iPhone 6 S or a ball.

57
00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:49.470
So let me come over here we have these arts contents and in here we have our 3-D objects and other objects

58
00:04:49.470 --> 00:04:52.530
that we are going to use in our projects for example.

59
00:04:52.650 --> 00:05:01.180
This space ship is given to us by Apple in order to test these augmented reality app as you can see

60
00:05:01.180 --> 00:05:05.160
this is completely a treaty and I can't see every dimension of this.

61
00:05:05.410 --> 00:05:11.820
When I go around when I go up when I go down I can't see every aspect of it.

62
00:05:11.920 --> 00:05:13.260
So it's kind of cool right.

63
00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.670
And we have the texture or years so this is the image wrapped around in my ship.

64
00:05:18.670 --> 00:05:20.860
So this is the same image as you can see.

65
00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:25.260
So this texture is wrapped wrapping around my ship.

66
00:05:25.330 --> 00:05:29.300
So in the view controller let's see what we have.

67
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.870
First we have the scene like we did in the sprite kit.

68
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.130
So we're working with scenes again.

69
00:05:35.290 --> 00:05:41.830
And in this scene we have the delegate ourself as usual and we are showing the statistics like frames

70
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:46.260
per second and timing later on I'm going to get rid of that.

71
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.510
Remember we don't need that.

72
00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.800
And over here we're creating a scene.

73
00:05:51.970 --> 00:05:54.780
And it this is an ACNC.

74
00:05:54.820 --> 00:06:01.070
So we're going to work with a Sienna objects over here and it gets its texture.

75
00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:09.060
It gets its image from our ship that a scene and we're setting this scene to be seen.

76
00:06:09.150 --> 00:06:16.930
I believe we can call this ship scene so it might be much better because calling this scene is actually

77
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:18.450
a little bit confusing.

78
00:06:19.420 --> 00:06:22.100
If he called his ship scene it won't matter.

79
00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:29.320
So seeing we've got seen we'll be ship scene later on we're going to see how we can create our own objects

80
00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:34.000
or how we can find some textures to work on 3D objects.

81
00:06:34.570 --> 00:06:38.240
OK so that's what we're doing in the we've added loads.

82
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.570
And over here in the view will appear it creates a configuration.

83
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:45.600
So this is very it gets important.

84
00:06:45.610 --> 00:06:48.320
So a our work tracking configuration.

85
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:55.690
So this is kind of a configuration that lets you track your object in your augmented reality app for

86
00:06:55.690 --> 00:07:00.210
example we're creating this ship and then we open our cam camera.

87
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:06.380
We will see the ship inside of our living room and the way to do that.

88
00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:14.200
We will just stabilize the ship in one point even even if we move it will not move with us it will be

89
00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:16.190
standing on that point.

90
00:07:16.390 --> 00:07:19.950
So it will really give us the feeling of reality.

91
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:20.600
OK.

92
00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:26.650
So these air bird tracking configuration is what makes it two.

93
00:07:27.130 --> 00:07:30.410
And in order to run this we need a nine Chip.

94
00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:37.060
OK so a eight and below doesn't support this air bird tracking configuration.

95
00:07:37.060 --> 00:07:45.820
So that's why we need an iPhone 6 S or a bow and under here we we're not doing so much and I believe

96
00:07:45.820 --> 00:07:52.150
now we are ready to test this because we have seen what's going on in here and of course we're going

97
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.400
to change this ship.

98
00:07:53.410 --> 00:07:59.050
We're going to bring in some new views are we going to see how we can create our own we use.

99
00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:05.520
But right now I want you to feel how augmented reality feels like.

100
00:08:05.530 --> 00:08:14.830
So take your iPhone and plug it on your X code plug it on your Mac and you will see your simulator.

101
00:08:14.890 --> 00:08:19.890
You will see your phone popping up in the simulator list over here like this.

102
00:08:19.900 --> 00:08:24.050
So choose it and run this in your own phone.

103
00:08:24.070 --> 00:08:31.600
So let me do it with you and you're going to see it will ask you to give some permission.

104
00:08:31.660 --> 00:08:33.120
And here you go.

105
00:08:33.130 --> 00:08:39.200
So this is my living room and I have my dog and dog is real but this ship is not.

106
00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:46.630
And as you can see when I come over here and there I can see all the aspects of this ship.

107
00:08:46.630 --> 00:08:52.660
So this really feels like I have a spaceship in my living room and this is cool.

108
00:08:53.260 --> 00:08:55.740
So as you can see we can see the right.

109
00:08:55.750 --> 00:08:56.770
We can see the bottom.

110
00:08:56.770 --> 00:08:59.520
You can see the top and left and everything.

111
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:01.870
So this is cool right.

112
00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:05.080
We're going to work on that later on.

113
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:11.770
So let me come back and as you can see now we're going to do a lot more cool things like this in this

114
00:09:11.770 --> 00:09:12.700
section.

115
00:09:12.730 --> 00:09:20.020
I believe you're ready to stop and continue within the next lecture to see how we can move our views

116
00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:21.310
inside of our app.
