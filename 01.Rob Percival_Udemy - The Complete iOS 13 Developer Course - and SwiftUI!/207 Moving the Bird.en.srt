00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,290
Hi.

2
00:00:01,400 --> 00:00:08,550
We didn't this lecture regrowing to see how we can actually move the bird around the scene in a free

3
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:16,260
way because I want to give him an initial push to throw him off the air right in order to do that.

4
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:24,990
I want to take him and drag him around the screen in a free way so that I can stretch him in the sling

5
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:26,280
shot.

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,370
So how do we do that.

7
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:35,220
Of course we're going to use touches began and touches moved functions but we also want to make sure

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:44,460
that we have a control in order to understand if the game is started or not because we want to do that

9
00:00:44,550 --> 00:00:47,830
only if the game is not started.

10
00:00:47,880 --> 00:00:52,160
So after game starts of two we push him off the air.

11
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:56,770
We don't want to grab him and move him around accidentally.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,890
So we have to have a boolean controlling if the game is started or not.

13
00:01:03,290 --> 00:01:05,810
And it's easy to have right.

14
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:13,230
So we can't come over here and we can just create a boolean called game started and it will be false

15
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:18,950
initially because game will not be started when you first open the app right.

16
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:21,720
We can just change it to be true.

17
00:01:21,750 --> 00:01:30,300
After we push the bird to the air so let's come over here and rather than flying the bird I'm just going

18
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:38,310
to move him around so I'm going to comment this so that you can have this as a note in the Github page

19
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:45,260
and over here I'm going to start by checking to see if game is started or not.

20
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:48,710
If game is not started then I'm going to do it.

21
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,270
If game is actually started then I'm not going to do this.

22
00:01:54,660 --> 00:02:03,870
And here I'm going to work with both touches begin and touches moot because not only user will tap was

23
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:11,400
but he or she will drag the bird around the screen so touch his mood will be necessary in this case

24
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:12,010
as well.

25
00:02:12,930 --> 00:02:18,660
So I'm going to write my function over here and then I'm going to copy everything on their touches moves

26
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,200
so I'm going to start by checking to see if game started is false.

27
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:24,810
Right.

28
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:29,700
So if this is false I'm going to do what I have to do.

29
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:37,980
So what I have to do is to understand very user touched so I'm going to say if that touches and as you

30
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,380
can say if that touch is touches dot first.

31
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:53,730
So this will give me the first touch that user has done so this touches come from the function itself.

32
00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:02,370
So this is kind of a UI touch object and it actually tells us the point that user has touched so I can

33
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:12,120
create a touch location out of that touch and it will drive from touch that's location and it will ask

34
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:13,580
before a scene or view.

35
00:03:13,590 --> 00:03:22,950
I'm going to say self and this will create my touch location later ohm I'm going to see what nodes that

36
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,100
the user touch arm.

37
00:03:25,170 --> 00:03:34,470
So if you say nodes as you can see it asks you for a CGI point you can give a touch location over here.

38
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:43,200
So this will give me the touched notes so I can understand if the user has touched on the bird so I'm

39
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:50,670
going to come over here to the touch nodes and I'm going to check to see if they're empty or not.

40
00:03:51,090 --> 00:03:59,940
If this is not empty it means that user has tapped on some notes and I'm going to go into a for loop

41
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:03,360
in that touch nodes as K node area.

42
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:10,140
And in here I'm actually going to check to see if the node is actually the bird.

43
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:15,780
So if this is in fact the bird then I'm going to move the bird around.

44
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,390
So if user touches on bucks I'm not gonna do that right.

45
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:25,080
I'm not going to move around the boxes I just want to move around the bird.

46
00:04:25,080 --> 00:04:32,600
So let me say that if let's sprite node as an S K sprite node because this is an escape note now that

47
00:04:32,630 --> 00:04:40,830
this case bright note then as you can see my birth is an escape sprite nodes that I can check to see

48
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:44,410
if my escape sprite node is actually the bird.

49
00:04:44,790 --> 00:04:51,860
So come over here I'd say if sprite is Bert then do this.

50
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:57,270
So what I'm about to do here to move the bird's position.

51
00:04:57,480 --> 00:05:05,190
So I want to move the bird to the current point that user has touched so you can just come over here

52
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:06,330
as a bird.

53
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:11,850
That position is now touch location.

54
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:12,980
Here we go.

55
00:05:12,980 --> 00:05:18,020
Now you moved the bird to the touched location.

56
00:05:18,020 --> 00:05:21,100
So of course you have to do that under touch.

57
00:05:21,100 --> 00:05:25,920
Moved as well because we just don't want to do it once.

58
00:05:26,030 --> 00:05:33,290
We want to do it continuously until user just lets off the touch.

59
00:05:33,290 --> 00:05:38,700
So let me try this on my simulator and let's see if we can move the bird around.

60
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,140
So here we go.

61
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:47,990
Now we can drag the bird around as we want freely and we cannot do that for boxes because we're checking

62
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:52,310
to see if our sprite is actually the bird.

63
00:05:52,370 --> 00:05:53,990
So this verse.

64
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:02,990
Now I can stretch this bird around and I can push him off the air so that it will just go off the air

65
00:06:03,290 --> 00:06:07,870
and it will just hit on or hit to the boxes.

66
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:14,540
Of course we're gonna have to figure out a way to understand if the user let go of their finger from

67
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:15,660
the bird.

68
00:06:15,740 --> 00:06:18,060
Let's do that in the next lecture.
