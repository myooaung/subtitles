00:00:00.060 --> 00:00:07.560
Hi within this lecture where you going to complete our model and we're going to have our list with sections

2
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.900
so we have created our favorite bands.

3
00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:18.000
Now I'm going to copy all of this because we are going to create the same thing with our favorite movies.

4
00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:23.320
So this will be the bends and this will be the movies.

5
00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:29.060
OK so the first movie that I'm going to create is the pulp fiction.

6
00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:35.610
This will be again a favorite elements and this time I'm going to call this pulp fiction and the image

7
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.010
name will be pulp fiction as well.

8
00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:46.170
So rather than saying no one music band I'm going to call this number one movie and I'm going to do

9
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.350
the same thing for others as well.

10
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:57.270
Of course in a real time real life example you may just call something like the director name or DRM

11
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:03.060
DV rating or some other explicit description as well.

12
00:01:03.130 --> 00:01:05.790
The second one will be The Dark Knight.

13
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:09.900
OK so the image name will be again The Dark Knight.

14
00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:20.240
So this way Dark Knight and this will be number two movie and the third one and the last one will be

15
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.060
Kill Bill.

16
00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:26.130
So this is again a Tarantino but let's go for it.

17
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:28.240
The name will be Kill Bill.

18
00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.480
Okay.

19
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:37.080
And the image will be again Kill Bill and the description will be number one movie number three movie

20
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:38.220
sorry.

21
00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:45.360
And rather than saying favorite bands I'm going to call those favorite movies and favorite model will

22
00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:48.080
be titled as favorite movies.

23
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.450
And this will have Pulp Fiction and The Dark Knight instead of Megadeth.

24
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:55.200
THIS FILM.

25
00:01:55.200 --> 00:01:56.480
Yep The Dark Knight.

26
00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:00.830
And rather than I remain and I'm going to call this Kill Bill.

27
00:02:00.990 --> 00:02:05.650
So after dads I'm done with creating my models.

28
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.090
I'm going to go ahead and find some related images for my models.

29
00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:17.680
So we already have a Metallica image over here so I'm going to search for another one.

30
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.830
And I believe the second one is Megadeth.

31
00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:23.120
So let's go for images.

32
00:02:23.180 --> 00:02:30.960
OK and I'm going to take this one and download it and the third one will be Iron Maiden.

33
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:32.540
OK.

34
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:38.810
And we have some fancy images over here so let's go for this one.

35
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:39.330
Yep.

36
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.270
Bring this in.

37
00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.680
And this is it's for favorite bands.

38
00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:45.730
Now let's move to movies.

39
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:51.180
So I'm going to search for Pulp Fiction and I believe this one is good.

40
00:02:51.180 --> 00:02:53.430
So let me choose this one.

41
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:55.180
I'm going to download this.

42
00:02:55.180 --> 00:02:58.580
OK and let's go for The Dark Knight.

43
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.740
So let's find a cool Batman picture.

44
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:04.650
OK this looks good.

45
00:03:04.650 --> 00:03:07.770
But I believe this is too small.

46
00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.230
Let's go for this one.

47
00:03:09.240 --> 00:03:11.190
Yep this is too small as well.

48
00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:11.910
Yeah.

49
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:13.020
This is good I believe.

50
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:15.650
So let me bring in does a batsman.

51
00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.400
And finally I'm going to go for a Kill Bill.

52
00:03:20.310 --> 00:03:21.090
So let's say.

53
00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:25.910
Kill Bill and let's find some good humor.

54
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:29.460
Turman picture like this or this one.

55
00:03:29.870 --> 00:03:30.100
Yep.

56
00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:30.810
This is good.

57
00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:32.830
Let's bring this in.

58
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:39.900
So after downloading all of this let me close this down and let me rename everything in my downloads

59
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:40.780
folder.

60
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:43.470
So I'm going to call this Kill Bill.

61
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.240
OK.

62
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:48.340
So it has to be the exact thing that I have called in my model.

63
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:53.090
So this is Dark Knight OK and this is I remained in.

64
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:59.780
And this is Megadeth and we have to have one more YEP THIS ONE Pulp Fiction.

65
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:04.900
So let me go into my assets folder and bring everything in.

66
00:04:04.920 --> 00:04:07.790
So this has to be like that.

67
00:04:07.820 --> 00:04:08.090
Yep.

68
00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:09.170
Five of them.

69
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:15.190
Now I have six images and my model is complete.

70
00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:22.170
Now I have to bring this favorite bands and favorite movies inside of an array so that I can display

71
00:04:22.170 --> 00:04:23.860
them inside of a list.

72
00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:31.430
So I'm going to call my array my favorites and this will have only the favorite bands and the favorite

73
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:32.730
movies.

74
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.330
OK.

75
00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.710
That's it.

76
00:04:34.710 --> 00:04:43.530
Now I can use this my favorite arrays and inside my inside of my list is a parameter to display all

77
00:04:43.540 --> 00:04:47.070
these titles and all those elements.

78
00:04:47.070 --> 00:04:51.970
So let's do that in our content view right.

79
00:04:52.020 --> 00:04:54.070
So let's go back to our content.

80
00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.820
We re going to display everything one by one and we're going to display the site Mills as section names

81
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:10.070
and we're going to display these names as regular names so we're going to use for each to do that.

82
00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:17.840
So rather than having texts and let me open my canvas so that we can see all the change over here and

83
00:05:17.930 --> 00:05:19.250
let me say resume.

84
00:05:19.810 --> 00:05:20.460
OK.

85
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:25.620
Once we see the preview we can go ahead and change this.

86
00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:28.330
So let's wait for Bill succeeds.

87
00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:28.760
Yep.

88
00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:30.620
Everything seems to be working.

89
00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:34.310
And let's delete this text rather than tax.

90
00:05:34.310 --> 00:05:42.170
I'm gonna have a list so I can give my favorites array as a parameter inside of my list.

91
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:49.550
And now I don't have to give a manual I.D. because my favorites is already identifiable.

92
00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:58.280
I can just call this favorite and have my own closure and display this favorite inside of a text like

93
00:05:58.280 --> 00:05:59.620
this right.

94
00:05:59.660 --> 00:06:07.930
So if I say a favorites it won't display it because my favorite is not actually a strange right.

95
00:06:07.940 --> 00:06:10.550
It's modeled it's this track.

96
00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:17.570
Let's meet let me just come over here it's an instance of a struct rather than a struct and I have to

97
00:06:17.570 --> 00:06:22.280
say favorite that title in order to get this straight.

98
00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.900
So I can come over here and say favorite that title and it will just display the titles of this favorite

99
00:06:29.900 --> 00:06:30.940
models.

100
00:06:31.130 --> 00:06:32.160
As you can see.

101
00:06:32.450 --> 00:06:35.520
But that's not quite what I had in mind.

102
00:06:35.570 --> 00:06:44.640
I want to have this as a section title and then under the sections I want to have my related elements.

103
00:06:44.690 --> 00:06:46.680
So how do we do that.

104
00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:53.060
I'm going to use for each loop and inside of that for each loop I'm going to call for each one more

105
00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:56.190
time to list the elements.

106
00:06:56.330 --> 00:06:58.300
So how do we do that.

107
00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:02.840
Of course I'm going to delete this and I'm going to work with the lists.

108
00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.480
So this will be a list.

109
00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:08.630
But under that list I'm going to have a for each loop.

110
00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:15.110
So I'm going to give my favorites as a parameter one more time and in fact I'm going to open my curly

111
00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:18.460
brace and I have my favorite closure.

112
00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:23.950
And rather than favorites I'm going to call it favorite because it will be an individual favorite.

113
00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:24.910
Right.

114
00:07:24.980 --> 00:07:32.630
And rather than showing this inside of a text I'm going to show this inside of a section so section

115
00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:37.280
is to create a hierarchical v content.

116
00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:43.340
So that's how it goes you either create a footer or you create an header.

117
00:07:43.670 --> 00:07:51.110
So we want the header because we want to show the titles in the beginning of a section K not the end

118
00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:52.280
of a section.

119
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:53.920
So choose this one.

120
00:07:53.930 --> 00:08:02.870
And for header I'm going to go for favorite title and for content if you hit enter over here it will

121
00:08:02.870 --> 00:08:09.000
create a coding block for you in which you will have your second for each loop.

122
00:08:09.260 --> 00:08:13.040
And this I believe gives us an error.

123
00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:16.920
And in order to solve this error let me see.

124
00:08:16.920 --> 00:08:27.080
Yes we we didn't actually write text over here so let me just delete this and come over here to my header

125
00:08:27.770 --> 00:08:32.640
and say something like text and show favorite that title.

126
00:08:32.830 --> 00:08:33.680
OK.

127
00:08:33.920 --> 00:08:38.060
And this will show us the favorite titles as a title.

128
00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:43.280
And again under these titles we are going to have our for each loops.

129
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:49.380
So let me close this left brain and right brain down and call our for each.

130
00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:56.370
Now I have to give the second array as a parameter in order to reach that I'm going to say favorite

131
00:08:56.370 --> 00:09:01.190
that elements remember inside of our favorite elements like this.

132
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:04.030
So come over here to your struct.

133
00:09:04.130 --> 00:09:06.350
So if you say favorite that elements.

134
00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:10.670
This will give you favorites elements array and that's what we want.

135
00:09:10.670 --> 00:09:17.960
That's what we want to give as a parameter so that we can reach the individual elements inside of that

136
00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:19.070
list.

137
00:09:19.070 --> 00:09:28.730
So let's go and say element in and this time I'm just going to call text OK and display element dot

138
00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:29.440
name.

139
00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:39.230
So once I do that I will get this beautiful view with section headers section titles and related items

140
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:42.170
inside of that section titles.

141
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:44.210
So that's cool.

142
00:09:44.240 --> 00:09:52.430
Now what I want to do when I just hit on one of the items it will take me to another view in which we

143
00:09:52.430 --> 00:09:56.750
will display the details of the selected elements.

144
00:09:56.750 --> 00:10:04.180
Let's do that within the next lecture and see how to do navigation how to have a second view and pass

145
00:10:04.180 --> 00:10:06.040
information between views.
