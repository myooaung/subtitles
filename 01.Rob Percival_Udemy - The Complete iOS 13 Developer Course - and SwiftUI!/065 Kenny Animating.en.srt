00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:06,090
Hi within this lecture we are going to find a way to estimate our candy.

2
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,980
And as I said before the way I'm going to do this is to hide all of these candies and then select the

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:24,990
one to display it only are we going to just change this selected one in a second or in a half a second

4
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:31,350
so that Kenny will be animating two discrete and in order to do that.

5
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:38,730
Of course we're going to use time we say again because that's an operation that we want to do in a given

6
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:46,530
preview of time and we want it to be working on the background without blocking of all the user interface

7
00:00:47,630 --> 00:00:55,400
but before we go ahead and do that I believe first we have to create a function to test and see how

8
00:00:55,400 --> 00:00:57,290
to hide Kenny's.

9
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,620
So we're going to take steps one by one.

10
00:01:00,620 --> 00:01:02,620
First hide all the kidneys.

11
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:07,490
Second find a way to randomly choose one of the kidneys and display it.

12
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:12,650
And then later on turned make this into a timer.

13
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:19,970
So I'm going to create a Kenny array in which we will have a UI Image view.

14
00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:27,590
OK so with in this array I will just add all of these candies.

15
00:01:28,460 --> 00:01:30,640
So why am I doing that.

16
00:01:31,160 --> 00:01:36,340
Why am I adding all the KDE inside of this category.

17
00:01:36,530 --> 00:01:42,270
Because actually that's a lot easier to do when you have on the array.

18
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,550
We can have for loop right with Missouri.

19
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:47,900
You will see what I mean.

20
00:01:47,900 --> 00:01:49,870
Let me just create disarray.

21
00:01:49,910 --> 00:01:51,330
I will say Kenny won.

22
00:01:51,350 --> 00:01:57,340
Kenny to Kenny tree and I will add all of the image views in this area.

23
00:01:58,160 --> 00:02:05,450
So we're already working with a lot of variables a lot of images so I'm trying to make this as simple

24
00:02:05,450 --> 00:02:08,090
as possible as efficient as possible.

25
00:02:08,240 --> 00:02:09,010
Okay.

26
00:02:09,290 --> 00:02:13,170
So I'm going to show you a good way to do this.

27
00:02:13,340 --> 00:02:23,390
So if I want to I can actually make all of this Kenny arrays with that append as well but it's not very

28
00:02:23,390 --> 00:02:23,900
efficient.

29
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:26,330
So you can just write it this way as well.

30
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:26,810
Right.

31
00:02:27,500 --> 00:02:30,950
So right now wi fi call one of these elements.

32
00:02:30,950 --> 00:02:32,010
What will I get.

33
00:02:32,060 --> 00:02:35,380
I will get the image view itself right.

34
00:02:35,390 --> 00:02:41,140
So if you're right Kenny you will see that this Kenny array is actually a UI Image view.

35
00:02:41,210 --> 00:02:48,110
So if I get one of these elements I can reach their properties and attributes and do whatever I want

36
00:02:48,110 --> 00:02:48,620
with them.

37
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:51,930
So let me create another function over here.

38
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:59,340
OK I'm going to call this function height Kenny and let me write it this way.

39
00:02:59,420 --> 00:03:04,790
So if I call one of the caddies I can make it invisible.

40
00:03:04,790 --> 00:03:06,460
So how do I do that.

41
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:11,080
There is a method to do that and you can just say is hit them.

42
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:12,780
So it's fairly easy.

43
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:18,700
So if you say Kenny one is here then OK this way.

44
00:03:18,830 --> 00:03:26,270
And if you set it to true then Kenny one will be here then Kenny one will be invisible.

45
00:03:26,270 --> 00:03:32,510
So I can do that for all of the kidney's one by one but I don't want to do that one by one.

46
00:03:32,510 --> 00:03:34,520
I want to do that with a loop.

47
00:03:34,670 --> 00:03:37,070
That would be much more easier for me.

48
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,070
That's why I created this category.

49
00:03:40,070 --> 00:03:49,010
I'm going to say for Kenny in Kenya Ray now I can't reach all of this Kenny's one by one in a loop and

50
00:03:49,010 --> 00:03:56,360
I can assign all these elements to a variable called Kenny and I can just say Kenny dots as you can

51
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:05,550
see this is still a UI image you can see that is hidden true so rather than doing this in nine lines

52
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,060
now I'm doing this inside of a loop.

53
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:10,310
So it's kinda cool.

54
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:11,440
Let us test this.

55
00:04:11,450 --> 00:04:19,680
So let me call the height kidney function in our we load because if we don't do that it won't even get

56
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:22,310
cold and it won't be executed.

57
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:29,570
So let me run this simulator and let's see if we managed to hide the kidneys.

58
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:30,480
So here we go.

59
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:36,450
We don't see any kidneys right now but we see the countdown timer and we see the score.

60
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,490
We cannot tap on anything because they are hear them.

61
00:04:40,590 --> 00:04:41,610
So that's good.

62
00:04:41,610 --> 00:04:42,930
That's step number one.

63
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,650
We we have hit them all the kidneys.

64
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:53,370
Now step number two I want to have a way to select a random kidney and make it visible.

65
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,570
So how do we do that.

66
00:04:56,570 --> 00:05:05,350
First of all if you don't know how to create a random number that's perfectly okay.

67
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,980
It's ask for random OK.

68
00:05:08,010 --> 00:05:14,820
If you just call out for a run the method is a built in method that you can use in swift and this will

69
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,330
ask you for an upper bound if you choose to ask for a random uniform.

70
00:05:19,530 --> 00:05:29,220
And if you say 9 for example to this upper bound it will return a value between 0 0 9 randomly so you

71
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:38,080
will get zero you will get two you will get three depending on totally random algorithms.

72
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:46,070
So for our upper bound of cause I want something between zero and 8 Y 8.

73
00:05:46,260 --> 00:05:47,790
You will see in ten minutes.

74
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:52,380
But right now it asks me for a UI internally to bits.

75
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:53,940
So this is an integer.

76
00:05:53,940 --> 00:06:03,300
So these are regular integer but it's 32 bit k if you just write a number in here it will be accepted

77
00:06:03,690 --> 00:06:14,730
like 10 but rather than saying 10 or 8 or 0 or 5 I'm going to go for Kenny array that count because

78
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:16,650
it will make much more sense.

79
00:06:16,650 --> 00:06:25,380
So if I say Canada or a dots count minus one this will be the exact number that I need because Tony

80
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:33,570
Kenny array that count will give me nine and I don't have an index nine indicate the array I only have

81
00:06:33,790 --> 00:06:38,570
0 1 2 3 4 5 6 8 7 8.

82
00:06:38,820 --> 00:06:45,480
So I can call it like this I can say Kenny array that I can erase 0 and it will give me Kenny 1 and

83
00:06:45,480 --> 00:06:52,870
I can say Kenny 3 8 and it will give me Kenny 9 so I have to have something between 0 and 8.

84
00:06:52,920 --> 00:07:02,240
There is no Kenny or a 9 K. So I'm not going to go for category that count but rather minus one.

85
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:06,680
So this will give me a number between 0 and 8.

86
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:17,370
So I'm going to use this a random number to call the Kenny in a random fashion and let me creates a

87
00:07:17,370 --> 00:07:20,880
variable in order to assign this as a value.

88
00:07:20,930 --> 00:07:28,080
OK I'm going to call this random and you have to convert this into an integer because that's not going

89
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:32,140
to give you an integer it's going to give you a UI in 32 bit.

90
00:07:32,290 --> 00:07:44,220
OK and I can't call this random number inside of Kenya array and I can just say dot is here the true

91
00:07:44,460 --> 00:07:47,280
right or is he them false.

92
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:47,680
Right.

93
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:51,290
This will make it reasonable one more time.

94
00:07:52,590 --> 00:07:55,160
So step two is actually complete.

95
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:04,440
So I'm choosing your random Kenny and I'm making it visible so I am hiding everything in here and then

96
00:08:04,440 --> 00:08:07,120
I'm making one reasonable.

97
00:08:07,710 --> 00:08:09,720
So let's try this.

98
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:11,840
So we're gonna see one Kenny.

99
00:08:12,090 --> 00:08:13,430
Yep that's working.

100
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,080
And we can click on it.

101
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:17,070
Let's run this one more time.

102
00:08:17,070 --> 00:08:21,840
So most probably we'll see another Kenny visible like this.

103
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:23,810
So it works.

104
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:31,780
Now we have to come up with a way to make this constantly rather than doing this manually over here.

105
00:08:31,980 --> 00:08:33,000
So far so good.

106
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:35,640
We have completed step 2.

107
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:39,560
Now we're heading towards Step 3 in Sep tree.

108
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:47,130
We're going to use timers one more time and I'm going to create another timer for that and I'm going

109
00:08:47,130 --> 00:08:49,640
to call this height timer.

110
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:58,130
So can we do that within the same timer here yeah actually we can do that but I'm not gonna.

111
00:08:58,140 --> 00:09:00,180
And I'm going to explain you why.

112
00:09:00,690 --> 00:09:04,060
So let me choose scheduled time moreover here.

113
00:09:04,170 --> 00:09:12,230
So in the schedule timer I'm going to give you time interval as all point five target as cells and for

114
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,890
selector I'm going to go for height Kenny right.

115
00:09:17,010 --> 00:09:21,090
Because I have already my function in here.

116
00:09:21,090 --> 00:09:25,050
That's what I want to run with this height timer.

117
00:09:25,170 --> 00:09:31,660
And as you can see we have to add Objective C so user in for Neal and repeats true.

118
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:35,310
So this is going to get run once I run this.

119
00:09:35,310 --> 00:09:41,460
So why am I writing this into a completely separate timer.

120
00:09:41,460 --> 00:09:45,770
And don't forget to invalidate this as well or else does.

121
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:49,470
Kenny will be circulating Kenny will be animating all the time.

122
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:58,350
So we're going to call his height Kenny and the reason they're doing this in a different timer is basically

123
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,270
I need another time interval.

124
00:10:01,650 --> 00:10:08,250
So as you can see in all points five seconds Kenny animates so this is cool.

125
00:10:08,250 --> 00:10:11,530
So this is what we wanted from the beginning.

126
00:10:11,530 --> 00:10:15,850
And as you can see once the timer is done Kenny stops.

127
00:10:16,020 --> 00:10:18,060
And of course I can hit.

128
00:10:18,150 --> 00:10:18,780
Okay.

129
00:10:18,780 --> 00:10:24,870
And Kenny still there so I can tap onto Kenny and it's kind of a bug in our game.

130
00:10:24,870 --> 00:10:27,690
So we need to fix this as well.

131
00:10:27,900 --> 00:10:35,580
And I believe the easiest way to fix this would be to copy all of these hiding things hiding for loop

132
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:38,010
and pasted in our if control.

133
00:10:38,010 --> 00:10:41,210
So if timer is ended.

134
00:10:41,220 --> 00:10:48,570
If timer has reached to zero then I'm going to validate all of the time present I'm going to hide Kenny

135
00:10:48,570 --> 00:10:49,920
over here.

136
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:58,780
Now we need to go and actually write a replay function and then high score function as well.
