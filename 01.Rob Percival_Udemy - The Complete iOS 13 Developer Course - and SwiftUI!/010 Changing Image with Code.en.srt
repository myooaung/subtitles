00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:06,270
Hi within this lecture we are going to write our first SWIFT code.

2
00:00:06,270 --> 00:00:08,790
So this is a big thing for us right.

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:16,800
So far we have connected our views to button clicks function over here and we have our image view right

4
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:19,530
below our view controller.

5
00:00:19,530 --> 00:00:23,580
So when you see this curly braces it means the coding block.

6
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:31,830
OK so we have a coding block in the class and we have a coding block inside of this button clicked.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,390
So we write our codes inside of these blocks.

8
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:45,210
So right now this button clicked created coding block for us and we're going to write what will happen

9
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:45,800
then.

10
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:52,570
And button is clicked inside of this function and here you see something called V did load.

11
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:57,040
This is automatically generated for us as you can see.

12
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:02,690
And this is what will happen when I open the app first.

13
00:01:02,700 --> 00:01:08,110
So this is the first time a real controller is loaded.

14
00:01:08,250 --> 00:01:17,130
So you five want something to happen then user opens their app I write it here but I don't want something

15
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:17,570
to happen.

16
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,930
When we first opened the app I want something to happen.

17
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:23,150
When I first click the button.

18
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:24,410
Right.

19
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:30,610
So I'm going to write my code under this coding block rather than did loads.

20
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:36,170
We're going to go into the details of we did load later on for right now.

21
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:42,450
Come over here to button clicked and we're going to call the image to you that we have defined as you

22
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:48,720
can see Image view refers to the image view that has been defined by us.

23
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,780
If you say Image view dot you can see the properties you can see the methods and attributes of the image.

24
00:01:56,910 --> 00:01:59,490
What do I mean by attributes.

25
00:01:59,490 --> 00:02:08,490
For example when we were doing something in the main that storyboard V can change we changed actually

26
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:10,670
the attributes from the attributes pane.

27
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:17,660
Right now I can reach all of these attributes and even more from here from the code.

28
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:28,470
Now if I say Image view dot I can see the ad too is like image in here Nancy can see it gives us a description.

29
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:31,890
So this is the image displayed in the Image view.

30
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:38,060
So if I choose this property I can just change this.

31
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:38,760
OK.

32
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,840
Inside of the coat.

33
00:02:41,370 --> 00:02:48,240
And again this is going to change the image view that image.

34
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,700
Van I right.

35
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:52,250
So let me show you what else.

36
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,730
So this will ask us to create an you eye image.

37
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,960
So this is kind of an object type.

38
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:08,910
OK we're going to need a UI image type object in order to change this.

39
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:17,970
So I'm going to type UI image and open parentheses so you don't understand by the UI image right now

40
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:25,260
because you don't know what the classes and you will understand this code later on very clearly.

41
00:03:25,260 --> 00:03:29,450
But for right now let me write the code and you will see what I mean.

42
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:33,880
If you open parentheses you will see some different options here.

43
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:42,600
I'm going to go for names because I'm going to create my image from a name I own already have my Metallica

44
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:44,670
to image over here.

45
00:03:44,790 --> 00:03:52,860
If I say Metallica to here in the quotation marks OK so open a quotation and this is double quotation

46
00:03:52,860 --> 00:04:01,050
marks not a single quotation so double quotation marks if I say Metallica to it will find the Metallica

47
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:10,110
to imaging my project it will convert it to be an image and it will display this image in my Image view.

48
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:16,550
So that's what it stands for Image view is the object that I have created.

49
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,500
So let me run in this simulator by the way.

50
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:26,670
So while it compiles I will explain the code one more time Image view is the object that I have defined

51
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:27,430
over here.

52
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,020
That image saying that change the image attribute.

53
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:41,850
And if I click on change as you can see the image actually changes to you I image named Metallica too.

54
00:04:42,140 --> 00:04:48,240
So if I clicked on the change again it won't change my march time because it's already Metallica to

55
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:56,220
image and you may think at this point how do I make an app that if I click on this change it will change

56
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,670
the image to Metallica one if I could that it will change the Metallica too.

57
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:05,050
And we're going to do that later on.

58
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,220
Don't worry about that.

59
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:09,190
We are going to see how we can achieve this result.

60
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:13,300
But for right now you don't know anything about swift yet.

61
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,920
So we have to learn the basics first.

62
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:22,640
This is just to get you comfortable with X code and congratulations on your first app.

63
00:05:22,660 --> 00:05:29,500
By the way you have just written an app in which you can change the favorite band image of yours.

64
00:05:29,590 --> 00:05:33,300
So let's step here and we're going to continue with the next one.
