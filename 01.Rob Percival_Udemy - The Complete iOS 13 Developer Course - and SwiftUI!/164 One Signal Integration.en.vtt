00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.250
Hi.

2
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:07.280
We didn't this lecture we're going to continue our configuration so that we can bring in the Von signal

3
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.770
SDK case to our project.

4
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:17.730
So far we have uploaded our P. twelve file and we are ready to go and select DSD case to download.

5
00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.350
OK.

6
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:21.190
So I'm going to say save ants.

7
00:00:21.290 --> 00:00:21.680
Yeah.

8
00:00:21.750 --> 00:00:26.250
We forgot to give the password that I have mentioned in the previous lecture.

9
00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.350
So remember we have created this P twelve file with a password.

10
00:00:31.350 --> 00:00:38.790
So come over here to production private key section and make sure you give the exact same password that

11
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.150
you have chosen.

12
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:47.430
And then after you can just say save an hour here you have to choose your SDK.

13
00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:50.430
And in our case it's of course native U.S..

14
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:58.830
OK after that you can just say next and it will ask you to install the SDK and it will give you an app

15
00:00:58.890 --> 00:00:59.440
I.D..

16
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:02.700
So we're going to need that app idea as well.

17
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:09.740
So make sure you're take note of this copy and paste it somewhere in your project as a note for example.

18
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:14.790
Because we are going to use it to enable the server and project connection.

19
00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.700
So let me open the documentation for IRS SDK setup.

20
00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.150
So as you can see we have a lot to do in this lecture as well because we are not going to just create

21
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:34.620
a path file and it will take care of everything for us but rather we are going to add a service extension.

22
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.190
So we have worked with this kind of thing before.

23
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:38.780
Right.

24
00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:44.970
So we have created some kind of keyboard extension but this time it's going to be a push notification

25
00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:45.840
extension.

26
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:52.680
So come over here to file new and rather than file say Target because we're going to work with that

27
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:58.350
extension and we have worked with this custom keyboard extension before.

28
00:01:58.350 --> 00:02:04.400
But right now we're looking for this notification service extension.

29
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.250
OK.

30
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.400
So you can't do that by following this documentation as you can see it says that please choose this

31
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:20.040
notification service and then come over here and just give some name and the name should be one signal

32
00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.270
notification service extension.

33
00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:27.450
So you have to give the exact same name because were you going to use it in code as well.

34
00:02:27.900 --> 00:02:34.910
So let me just choose that name copy it and choose Chilton notification service extension and paste

35
00:02:34.940 --> 00:02:42.420
over here and make sure the projects and target is selected and then you can just come over here and

36
00:02:42.420 --> 00:02:51.780
say activate or cancel In fact you can just say cancel because you're not going to use this to run in

37
00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.580
our simulator right.

38
00:02:53.610 --> 00:03:01.290
So as you can see it now has this as a target but rather we just want our project to be target our project

39
00:03:01.290 --> 00:03:03.780
to be displayed in the simulator.

40
00:03:03.780 --> 00:03:10.770
And in fact if you come over here to documentation you will see that it's actually suggests to click

41
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:13.670
on cancel rather than activating it.

42
00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.660
So that we won't deal with this problem.

43
00:03:17.730 --> 00:03:19.170
But it's fairly easy.

44
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:26.100
You can come over here to your project and select the iPhone X hour from here so that it will be reversed.

45
00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:28.050
So that's it.

46
00:03:28.050 --> 00:03:37.690
So now we have implemented these extension in our projects and we can see the extension in menus.

47
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:38.680
OK.

48
00:03:38.790 --> 00:03:41.970
Now let's continue come over here.

49
00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:50.290
And as you can see it asks us to go into the signings and take care of this deployment target think.

50
00:03:50.430 --> 00:03:56.170
And it suggests us to lower our deployment target to 10.

51
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:02.130
But since we have two teams over here I don't think we need to do that.

52
00:04:02.130 --> 00:04:02.460
OK.

53
00:04:02.460 --> 00:04:05.270
Because we are already working with 13.

54
00:04:05.310 --> 00:04:07.230
We don't need to lower it to 10.

55
00:04:07.470 --> 00:04:11.770
I believe it suggests not to use it below 10.

56
00:04:11.790 --> 00:04:13.890
So we are using it with 13.

57
00:04:13.890 --> 00:04:15.570
So it will be okay for us.

58
00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:25.150
I'm going to leave that asked her T and later on we're going to have to bring in this code in order

59
00:04:25.150 --> 00:04:26.530
to initialize the app.

60
00:04:26.620 --> 00:04:33.850
As you can see there is an objective c and swift files over here and we need to create that file and

61
00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:37.260
bring in this as it is.

62
00:04:37.270 --> 00:04:41.950
So let me do that let me open this extension okay.

63
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:48.750
The file is already created for us but we are going to delete everything inside of that extension and

64
00:04:48.750 --> 00:04:52.810
we are going to replace it with the given code.

65
00:04:52.930 --> 00:04:54.190
So let's do that.

66
00:04:54.190 --> 00:04:56.720
Let me copy everything from here.

67
00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:57.540
OK.

68
00:04:57.610 --> 00:05:00.310
And select everything first.

69
00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:05.850
So I believe we can do some commands a or we can just hit copy over here.

70
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:07.540
So it will copy everything.

71
00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:13.600
So I'm going to do a command and delete everything from here and paste the codes in.

72
00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:21.340
So that's that's what we're going to be using to connect our app to that one signal.

73
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:27.690
And as you can see we cannot imparts one signal yet because we haven't downloaded the SDK case.

74
00:05:27.730 --> 00:05:29.860
That's what we're going to do now.

75
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:36.730
So after you do that you have to download the parts to your project.

76
00:05:36.850 --> 00:05:42.580
It's free and easy to do that now because we have already done all the setup that we need.

77
00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.840
Now we need to create a path file like we did before every going to use that part file in order to bring

78
00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:54.840
in the projects they want signal into our projects.

79
00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:00.930
So as you can see we have a path file over here and make sure you copy the latest version.

80
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.880
So I'm going to copied this one over here so it's kind of like 2 6 2 2 3 versions and make sure you

81
00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.830
copy the latest version that are shown in the documentation.

82
00:06:14.830 --> 00:06:15.460
OK.

83
00:06:15.550 --> 00:06:23.740
So let me close this down and let me go to my project folder because I already have a pop filing my

84
00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:24.840
project folder.

85
00:06:25.030 --> 00:06:32.300
So if you're doing this with a new project you have to Rampart in it and you know how this works.

86
00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:35.680
So let me zoom in so we can see it better.

87
00:06:35.710 --> 00:06:40.870
So as you can see I have this firebase base paths and I have this as the web image pops.

88
00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:44.300
So I'm going to bring in the pods as of this.

89
00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:50.320
So we have to change something over here but I'm just going to show you what will happen if we don't

90
00:06:50.320 --> 00:06:51.360
change it.

91
00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:57.610
So it's actually good idea to read what you're doing before you do it.

92
00:06:57.640 --> 00:06:59.810
So I'm going to show you how this works.

93
00:06:59.890 --> 00:07:07.180
After copying and pasting and saving it in the pilot file I'm going to open my terminal because as you

94
00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.370
know I'm going to move into my folder with change directory comments.

95
00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:20.170
So my folder is under downloads so if yours is like in the desktop you have to run see the desktop and

96
00:07:20.170 --> 00:07:28.420
then you can find your insta clone file your base folder and then later on I'm going to run party install

97
00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:37.140
and it won't install these parts for me because I haven't configured it in a very proper Ray.

98
00:07:37.270 --> 00:07:45.610
As you can see it says that you how Target named a project name over here and it doesn't make sense.

99
00:07:45.610 --> 00:07:51.210
So yep we have to change that and we have to change something else as well.

100
00:07:51.220 --> 00:07:57.430
So let me come over to my pop file one more time so that we can try to change it.

101
00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:01.630
So let me go over to my OS complete.

102
00:08:01.690 --> 00:08:07.230
Let me go to my Easter chrome file your base to my pod file and open it.

103
00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:08.300
OK.

104
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:13.260
So let me zoom in so that we can see it better.

105
00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:18.940
And over here we're going to see something called Project name.

106
00:08:18.940 --> 00:08:21.860
And we have to change this project name.

107
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:27.330
Because we don't have this project name we have is a clone file your base.

108
00:08:27.330 --> 00:08:31.690
So let me copied this and let me paste it over here.

109
00:08:31.780 --> 00:08:35.140
So we have to change this target.

110
00:08:35.230 --> 00:08:41.660
And here we have this one signal notification service extension as you can see.

111
00:08:41.710 --> 00:08:48.460
So this board to resolve our issue I believe because a free run path to install one more time you will

112
00:08:48.460 --> 00:08:53.070
see we get the same problem because we need to do one more thing.

113
00:08:54.160 --> 00:09:01.990
So targeting the app and targeting the Von signal notification separately makes sense but you have to

114
00:09:01.990 --> 00:09:09.700
just cut this pub and paste it over here because we already have this target over here right.

115
00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:16.030
So now I just say Paul the want signal and 2 6 2 3 point 0.

116
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:22.980
And in the Von signal notification service I have the same exact versions again.

117
00:09:23.330 --> 00:09:28.830
You have to use the latest version K and the round potty install.

118
00:09:28.850 --> 00:09:34.050
And this time it will just install all the related dependencies for me.

119
00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:41.540
As you can see I have already filed your base on other ones in my computer so it shows in black but

120
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:48.590
I'm downloading the one signal as a new pod so it shows in green and I believe it won't take much time

121
00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:54.860
because we already have Firebase and we're just downloading one single pod over here.

122
00:09:55.010 --> 00:09:57.280
As you can see it's already finished.

123
00:09:57.320 --> 00:10:00.000
Now I'm ready to use one signal.

124
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:06.390
OK so let me close this down and let me open my workspace project.

125
00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:14.390
Not the projects filed but workspace file OK after that as you can see we have to let me come over here

126
00:10:14.390 --> 00:10:14.690
yep.

127
00:10:14.750 --> 00:10:16.110
We already did that.

128
00:10:16.220 --> 00:10:20.840
We already imported this in our extension.

129
00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:27.340
And let me go to extension and as you can see in Port one signal doesn't give any error right now.

130
00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:33.100
It's already indexing so everything seems to be synchronizing and working in my project.

131
00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:36.050
So there is not any issue.

132
00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:45.170
So let me go back to the commentator one more time and yeah we did that and now we have to add the required

133
00:10:45.170 --> 00:10:49.100
capabilities inside of X code as well.

134
00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:55.600
So here it is shown how to do that but it's actually changed in the U.S. 13.

135
00:10:56.210 --> 00:11:04.620
So if you're using x code eleven and a bow you will just have to follow my lead rather than this.

136
00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:07.550
So let me come over here and show you how it's done.

137
00:11:07.550 --> 00:11:13.740
If you come over here to signing and capabilities you won't see any capabilities.

138
00:11:13.910 --> 00:11:20.450
So you know we're going to add one you have to come over here and drag and drop something.

139
00:11:20.510 --> 00:11:21.160
Okay.

140
00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.400
As you can see it's my target over here selected so make sure your target project is selected rather

141
00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.280
than your extension.

142
00:11:30.500 --> 00:11:36.620
And if you cannot see a menu like this let me show you how to find this.

143
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:43.070
So you have to come over here to capability section a if you hit over here it will open something like

144
00:11:43.070 --> 00:11:51.260
a library and you will see the push notifications over here and bring in that one and it doesn't end

145
00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.740
there unfortunately we have to bring in one more thing.

146
00:11:54.740 --> 00:11:58.390
And it's called background services background modes.

147
00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:05.280
So bring in the background modes and under background most you have to find this remote notification.

148
00:12:05.310 --> 00:12:11.420
OK so make sure you select the remote notifications and make sure you bring in the push notifications

149
00:12:11.420 --> 00:12:12.960
as well.

150
00:12:12.980 --> 00:12:17.030
Finally we have to add the required code.

151
00:12:17.270 --> 00:12:25.010
So as you can see we have a required code in order to start this under did finish launching with options

152
00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:27.440
in the app delegate as usual.

153
00:12:28.040 --> 00:12:35.390
So you have to just copy and paste this code but this time you have to give your f ideas value your

154
00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:37.160
one signal idea as well.

155
00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:41.400
So let me come over here to app delegates and paste everything here.

156
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:42.440
OK.

157
00:12:42.470 --> 00:12:49.100
As you can see this is something like running firebase that configure but it's actually a little bit

158
00:12:49.100 --> 00:12:49.950
longer.

159
00:12:49.970 --> 00:12:57.920
So let me import the one signal so that these errors will go away and we have to change only one single

160
00:12:57.920 --> 00:13:02.730
item over here which is our app one signal app I.D..

161
00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:05.180
So we have this before.

162
00:13:05.210 --> 00:13:06.710
Remember the.

163
00:13:06.710 --> 00:13:08.770
Had this given over here.

164
00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:17.090
So you have to copy this app idea and come back to your X code project where you can just paste in the

165
00:13:17.090 --> 00:13:19.340
app I.D. over here.

166
00:13:19.790 --> 00:13:27.300
So I know this is a lot and this is taking too long but right now we are ready to use it.

167
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:33.670
Right now we have brought in the search goods we have done area set up that we want to do.

168
00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:40.920
The last thing that we want to do is to come over here and just import the one signal.

169
00:13:40.970 --> 00:13:41.200
Yeah.

170
00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:43.130
We already done that.

171
00:13:43.230 --> 00:13:47.500
As you can see it asks us to pace design under Abdullah.

172
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.520
Did finish launching with options.

173
00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.140
Yeah we already done that and now we're done.

174
00:13:52.200 --> 00:13:56.300
Now we're ready to send our first push notifications.

175
00:13:56.360 --> 00:14:02.780
Finally let's stop here and within the next picture we're going to see how to send our push notifications

176
00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.080
manually from the one signal dashboard.
