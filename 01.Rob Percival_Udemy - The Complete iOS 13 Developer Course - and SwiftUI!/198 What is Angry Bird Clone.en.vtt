Hi within this section regrouping to build an Angry Bird clone.

2
00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:11.720
Where are you going to use something called sprite kids in order to do that in this Sprite kid.

3
00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:15.000
In this game we actually have a physical world.

4
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.280
For example we have a gravity going gone.

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.790
We have a mess in this bird.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.790
We have a mess in these boxes.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:31.950
So we use some force as we use some techniques in order to make our bird go away like this.

8
00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.640
So when a bird hits on one of the boxes or any other boxes.

9
00:00:36.780 --> 00:00:40.270
It just moves the boxes just intersects.

10
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:45.530
It just collides with the boxes and as you can see them we hit some boxes.

11
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:54.630
Our score increases and we're living inside of a physical world right now and we can't change its attributes

12
00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:56.580
in a way that we want.

13
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.570
We can make it.

14
00:00:57.570 --> 00:00:59.190
No gravity zone.

15
00:00:59.190 --> 00:01:02.660
We can increase the gravity we can decrease the gravity.

16
00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:10.110
We can increase the mass of this bird or we can decrease the mass of these boxes in a way that we want.

17
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:12.170
We can make the birds fly.

18
00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.420
We can push the birds in a way that we want.

19
00:01:15.420 --> 00:01:17.050
We can rotate the bird.

20
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:20.030
We can rotate the boxes and everything.

21
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:28.620
Once you master the sprite kids you will be able to build the games that you want in US.

22
00:01:28.620 --> 00:01:35.280
Furthermore we are not only going to see how to build these games we are also going to learn how to

23
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.210
find images so that we can use freely in our own games as well.

24
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:46.310
So if you're ready let's stop here and continue within the next lecture.
