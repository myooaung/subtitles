00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.360
Hi.

2
00:00:01.500 --> 00:00:09.780
Once you complete your app and once you ensure that your app meets the expectations of Apple then you're

3
00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:14.550
ready to sign your app and upload it to the App Store in order to do that.

4
00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:17.700
You have to go developer dot apple dot com.

5
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:22.820
One more time to go into your account in order to upload your app.

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:25.480
You have to have a developer account.

7
00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:26.230
Okay.

8
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:33.750
In case you don't have you can click over here and sign in with your Apple I.D. and then come over here

9
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:41.010
to membership tab in order to sign up for Apple Developer account membership.

10
00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:44.280
Unfortunately you're going to have to pay for that.

11
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:48.220
It costs a hundred dollars per year right now.

12
00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:50.530
So it's kind of expensive.

13
00:00:50.640 --> 00:00:58.230
For example in Google Play we only pay twenty five dollars just for once but here we pay one hundred

14
00:00:58.230 --> 00:01:00.000
dollars annually.

15
00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:02.190
So that's the policy for Apple.

16
00:01:02.220 --> 00:01:08.490
But if you want to publish your app to the App Store unfortunately you're going to have to do that.

17
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:14.400
So after you get your developer account then you will reach this menu.

18
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:23.740
Okay and make sure after you get this developer account come over here to preferences and under a council

19
00:01:23.740 --> 00:01:24.320
tab.

20
00:01:24.420 --> 00:01:30.660
Make sure that your Apple I.D. your developer I.D. is connected over here so you can just connect by

21
00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:38.150
selecting Apple I.D. and signing in with your gmail or any other mail account and your password.

22
00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:39.420
They polite password.

23
00:01:39.450 --> 00:01:47.040
Okay so make sure your developer I.D. is connected to your ex quote because that's what you will need

24
00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:53.970
bi you try to upload your app to the App Store so after that you're going to have to go to decertify

25
00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:03.030
Gates identifiers and profiles after you click over here you will see some menu and in this menus you

26
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:08.040
will see some search of goods identifiers devices profiles.

27
00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:12.270
And don't worry we're going to work with most of them anyway.

28
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.320
And in fact in push notifications section we have worked with them but in case you missed them Don't

29
00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.220
worry we're going to do everything from scratch.

30
00:02:23.220 --> 00:02:30.600
First of all we are going to create an identifier and this certificate and together with the search

31
00:02:30.690 --> 00:02:34.410
get an identifier we were going to create a profile.

32
00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:37.590
So that's what we going to use to upload our app.

33
00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:39.990
We're going to need a profile.

34
00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:43.280
First step would be to create an identifier.

35
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:47.660
So if you hit this plus button you will see some big menu.

36
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:54.480
So we're looking for app I.D. and menu choose your app I.D. you will see some bucks asking for your

37
00:02:54.480 --> 00:03:02.280
bundle I.D. So come over here to your general settings and copy your bundle identifier from your project

38
00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:04.080
and pasted in here.

39
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:11.040
And in this description bugs you're going to have to give some description for your identifier.

40
00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:16.600
You can just write your app name like this and just hit continue.

41
00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.510
And of course over here don't forget to Choose your platform.

42
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:27.300
And under here these capabilities if you're looking for a capability you're more than welcome to choose

43
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:27.450
it.

44
00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:34.170
So remember we have done that in the push notifications section but right now I'm going to register

45
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:38.340
this so that I can see my app in this list.

46
00:03:38.340 --> 00:03:45.900
As you can see now I see the app store test over here and it means that it's registered to my developer

47
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.840
account.

48
00:03:47.130 --> 00:03:51.630
After doing the identifiers we're going to have to create our shirt.

49
00:03:52.290 --> 00:03:58.100
So go over your certificates in which you can see your existing certificates as well.

50
00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.560
For example I have some distribution and development certificates over here but I'm not interested in

51
00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.250
those.

52
00:04:05.250 --> 00:04:12.130
I'm just going to create a new certificate because I want to have a April distribution search for kids

53
00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:17.510
in which I can publish my app for X called eleven and a bowl.

54
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:24.420
So in here you can see some push notification services but I'm not interested in that anymore.

55
00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:29.130
I am rather interested in this apple distribution service.

56
00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:36.540
So come over here to software and find some distribution certificate which lets you upload your apps

57
00:04:36.540 --> 00:04:44.270
sign your app and which lets you upload an app that is created with X Code eleven and a.

58
00:04:44.370 --> 00:04:48.500
So as you can see the second choice is for me.

59
00:04:48.510 --> 00:04:54.430
So I'm looking for does X called eleven and a bow and I'm not looking for development.

60
00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.250
I'm looking for distribution.

61
00:04:56.370 --> 00:05:04.090
Development means I'm still in the development phase so I want to test my app so that I can just upload

62
00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:08.630
it and use it something with something called test flight.

63
00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:10.160
So I don't need that.

64
00:05:10.210 --> 00:05:15.630
I'm just trying to distribute my app in the app store because I'm finished.

65
00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:16.090
Right.

66
00:05:16.630 --> 00:05:23.740
So rather than development I'm going to go for distribution and this this is actually true for other

67
00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.630
steps as well.

68
00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:32.920
You will see some sort of development and distribution differentiation in other steps.

69
00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:40.180
And in here it asks us to create a CSR file and if you click on this learn more think it will give you

70
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:44.740
a documentation to create your signing requests.

71
00:05:44.890 --> 00:05:51.490
And if you haven't done this yet you can of course follow this documentation but I'm going to show you

72
00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:52.270
anyway.

73
00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:57.790
So open your search box and search for a key chain access.

74
00:05:57.790 --> 00:05:59.060
So this is key chain.

75
00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:01.200
Remember we store our passwords.

76
00:06:01.210 --> 00:06:07.300
We saw our assertive kids inside of our mac book in the key chain access.

77
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:13.710
So we are going to use this key chain access to create a new certificate signing to request.

78
00:06:13.720 --> 00:06:18.270
So this will know this search good will come from us.

79
00:06:18.280 --> 00:06:25.810
So after you come over here to certificate assistant find and this option request the certificate from

80
00:06:25.810 --> 00:06:27.270
a certificate authority.

81
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.470
So it will ask you to provide an email address and then name.

82
00:06:32.470 --> 00:06:40.930
So make sure you save this to disk and then again after you provide your email address you're more than

83
00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:46.620
welcome to write your own name or your organization's name in the coming name section.

84
00:06:46.630 --> 00:06:47.420
OK.

85
00:06:47.590 --> 00:06:55.000
So after you do that make sure you don't provide any CIA email address and save it to the disk.

86
00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:01.660
I'm going to save it to my desktop so that I can easily reach it later on because we're going to need

87
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:04.170
it to upload over here.

88
00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:10.870
So if you choose that file that's certs forget signing your request that we have just created.

89
00:07:10.900 --> 00:07:13.030
You can hit continue.

90
00:07:13.270 --> 00:07:18.520
And here it will create a new certificate for you as you can see.

91
00:07:18.520 --> 00:07:25.870
Now you can download your certs for good and it will appear in your developer account any time you are

92
00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:31.000
you try to create something like provisioning profile.

93
00:07:31.060 --> 00:07:36.070
So let me bring in bring this into my desktop as well.

94
00:07:36.070 --> 00:07:44.260
And then I can go back not the third step would be to go into the profiles tab to create a provisioning

95
00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.760
profile.

96
00:07:45.760 --> 00:07:50.890
So in here regrouping to create what we need to upload our app to the App Store.

97
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:51.600
Finally.

98
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:54.130
So after you create your shirt.

99
00:07:54.130 --> 00:07:55.120
Good.

100
00:07:55.150 --> 00:08:01.000
And after you register your identifier then you're more than welcome to come over here and hit this

101
00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.350
plus sign.

102
00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.300
And in here as you can see there is a development section and distribution section.

103
00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:13.900
And for the reasons that I have explained before I'm going to go for distribution and I'm going to choose

104
00:08:13.900 --> 00:08:15.140
the App Store.

105
00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:20.560
So once I continue I can choose my app from this app idea list.

106
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:24.760
So I'm going to choose my app store test and I'm going to continue.

107
00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:31.790
So this will ask me for my distribution certificate and I'm going to choose the latest one.

108
00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:35.470
And as you can see this is X Code eleven or later.

109
00:08:35.470 --> 00:08:40.040
So I'm going to proceed with this and say continue.

110
00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:44.890
And once I provide the provisioning profile name I can generate this.

111
00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:49.930
So I'm going to call this app store test profile and it will.

112
00:08:49.970 --> 00:08:58.180
Jen it will generate this provisioning profile for me that I can download this and move this to my desktop

113
00:08:58.210 --> 00:08:59.360
as well.

114
00:08:59.470 --> 00:09:00.850
So that's it.

115
00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.970
That's all you have to do to complete your procedures about search forgets identifiers and profiles.

116
00:09:08.980 --> 00:09:09.680
OK.

117
00:09:09.730 --> 00:09:14.210
Once you do that now you're done with developer dub Apple dot com.

118
00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:21.790
Actually now we want to go to another Web site in which we will manage our uploaded apps or in which

119
00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:28.450
we will just upload a new app and it's called App Store connect that Apple dot com.

120
00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:35.980
Maybe you have heard this as items connect that Apple dot com before but now it's renamed.

121
00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:42.590
So if you go to I tos and I connect dots Apple dot com it will redirect you to the App Store connect

122
00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:44.420
dot the apple dot com anyway.

123
00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:51.070
So this is a great platform by Apple in which we can interact with our apps.

124
00:09:51.070 --> 00:09:54.830
So if we don't have any app we can upload any one.

125
00:09:54.910 --> 00:10:02.160
And if we have existing apps we can check for their statistics by clicking on this app analytics.

126
00:10:02.190 --> 00:10:09.860
OK in this account I don't have any pre installed apps so I believe you're going to see an empty page

127
00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:14.330
in which we will have some empty tables like this.

128
00:10:14.330 --> 00:10:14.650
OK.

129
00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:21.320
So you can see the impressions you can see the downloads numbers and everything over here.

130
00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:28.190
So let me go back to app store that's Apple dot com so that we can add a new app.

131
00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.380
OK.

132
00:10:29.720 --> 00:10:38.300
You will see my app section if you click over here it will take you to your pre-existing apps or if

133
00:10:38.300 --> 00:10:41.330
you want to add a new app you can do it from here as well.

134
00:10:41.960 --> 00:10:48.930
So if you come over here to plus sign if you say new app it will let you create a new app.

135
00:10:49.070 --> 00:10:52.780
And as you can see I believe there is an agreement update.

136
00:10:52.850 --> 00:10:56.660
So we have to accept that agreement first.

137
00:10:56.660 --> 00:11:02.960
So let me click on that agreement and here you will see some agreements from the apple.

138
00:11:03.320 --> 00:11:05.260
And I'm just going to sign them.

139
00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:12.860
So I'm going to say a view and come over here and say I have read and hit on this a green button.

140
00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:18.870
So that's how I can agree to this and go back to create my app.

141
00:11:18.890 --> 00:11:22.830
So once I do that now I believe that's OK.

142
00:11:22.840 --> 00:11:28.900
And it's asking me for for some tax and banking and contact information.

143
00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:35.270
So if you want to solve your app for a price on AppStore then of course you're going to have to provide

144
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.430
that information but in my case I'm going to make my app free.

145
00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.560
So I'm not going to fill in those numbers like banking and taxing and everything.

146
00:11:45.950 --> 00:11:51.650
So I'm going to go back to my app and I'm going to say new app one more time.

147
00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.130
And here you go.

148
00:11:53.180 --> 00:12:00.920
Now I can just choose the platform from here as I U.S. and give it a name like app store test.

149
00:12:00.920 --> 00:12:04.630
And here I have to choose my primary language.

150
00:12:04.790 --> 00:12:08.630
So let's choose English U.S. for example.

151
00:12:08.630 --> 00:12:12.010
And of course you can choose your own language as well.

152
00:12:12.020 --> 00:12:19.240
If you're just targeting a specific language and then later on in the bundle the section you're going

153
00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:21.370
to have to find your app.

154
00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:28.620
And this is by provisioning profile comes into play since we managed to complete that.

155
00:12:28.730 --> 00:12:30.760
It displays over here.

156
00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:31.930
OK.

157
00:12:32.030 --> 00:12:40.100
So under Eskew this stands for stock keeping unit and you have to provide the unique value to differentiate

158
00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:42.970
your app from the others in the App Store.

159
00:12:43.070 --> 00:12:46.360
So you can't just write whatever you want from here.

160
00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:50.610
I'm just going to go for something like app store test RTL some.

161
00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:51.440
OK.

162
00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:56.160
