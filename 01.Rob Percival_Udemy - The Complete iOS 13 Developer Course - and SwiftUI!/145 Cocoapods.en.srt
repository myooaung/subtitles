1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:01,530
Hi.

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:08,910
We didn't this lecture we going to see how we can connect this firebase project with our X gold project.

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:09,570
Okay.

4
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:12,770
In order to do that I'm gonna go for IRS here.

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:15,480
By the way they can't change these images.

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:21,630
They can change the layouts from here and you're just going to have to find the U.S. icon and click

7
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:21,960
on it.

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:23,430
That's all you have to do.

9
00:00:23,450 --> 00:00:24,420
Okay.

10
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:29,010
And after that it will ask you for your IRS bundle I.D..

11
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:35,280
So this is the bundle idea of the project that you want to contact your file your base.

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:35,920
Okay.

13
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:44,160
So this is going to register our app and it asks for a unique I.D. like a bundle I.D. in order to connect

14
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:46,380
the two projects together.

15
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:53,580
So remember if you click on this you can see your bundle identifier and you can copy it and then paste

16
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:57,650
it here so that it will be registered to your bundle I.D..

17
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,260
So if you want you can give it you these app a nickname.

18
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:09,660
So I'm gonna go for D instead cologne firebase one more time and it's optional you don't have to do

19
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:10,780
that.

20
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:15,510
And later on it will ask for an app store I.D..

21
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:22,910
Since we haven't put our project in the App Store yet we can just skip this and say registered.

22
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:23,920
Yep.

23
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:30,660
So this will be registered and then it will create a configuration file for us.

24
00:01:30,660 --> 00:01:37,950
So now you'll see the configuration file and this is called a Google service info that piece lists all

25
00:01:37,950 --> 00:01:43,910
we have to do is just downloading this file and add this to our project.

26
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,050
OK.

27
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,930
So let me click on here.

28
00:01:47,050 --> 00:01:49,950
Download Google's service info dot P lists.

29
00:01:50,460 --> 00:01:58,410
And if there is any bug or something if this doesn't work you can't always come back later on to download

30
00:01:58,410 --> 00:02:01,020
it from the settings of your project.

31
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:09,630
OK so let me drag and drop in here and make sure that you drag and drop inside of your insta glowing

32
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,720
file your base folder and make sure that this copy items if needed.

33
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:22,380
And Target is selected and you can just click on finished to import this file as you can see if you

34
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,200
click on it.

35
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:32,070
We have some credentials here and we have some API keys client I.D. and other some important stuff in

36
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:40,370
order to connect our service connect our firebase server so these values are actually just for us.

37
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:43,550
Derek created uniquely for our project.

38
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:51,120
So if you don't have this Google service that info or if you have a bad Google service that info file

39
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,810
your app won't connect to defy your base.

40
00:02:54,810 --> 00:03:01,940
So make sure you do this step and then later on you have to add firebase SDK case.

41
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:03,910
So there is a guide to do that.

42
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:04,730
OK.

43
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,100
So I'm going to click on that guide and it will take me back to our dashboard.

44
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:20,010
So in here in the documentation we're going to how to find how to download how to integrate file based

45
00:03:20,010 --> 00:03:24,020
software development kits to our X code project.

46
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:29,680
And as you can see their documentation for IRS Android flatter and lap.

47
00:03:29,790 --> 00:03:37,110
So we're going to go for IRS obviously and we have a very good documentation here later on we're going

48
00:03:37,110 --> 00:03:45,460
to see the cloud fire sir authentication storage and they're explaining everything we need to know actually.

49
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:53,810
In fact you could have just come over here and try to understand everything by reading from this documentation.

50
00:03:53,910 --> 00:03:56,910
But don't worry I'm going to explain everything.

51
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,030
So right now we have to come up with a way to integrate SDK case.

52
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:10,360
If you follow here you you will see some steps like a project register your app you have already done

53
00:04:10,360 --> 00:04:11,140
this right.

54
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,260
We have created an X code project.

55
00:04:13,320 --> 00:04:21,530
We have registered our app using our bundle app I.D. And we even have integrated this config file.

56
00:04:21,540 --> 00:04:26,340
The step forward would be to add the file your base the case.

57
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:29,460
So that's what we're looking for.

58
00:04:29,460 --> 00:04:32,030
So let's see how it's done.

59
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:35,260
As you can see there are steps in here as well.

60
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:43,730
And it asks us to create something called part file and it says that you have to run this comment part

61
00:04:43,730 --> 00:04:44,290
in it.

62
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,480
So what is a part.

63
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,660
So it's kind of a tool.

64
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:56,650
It's kind of a technology that lets us integrate this kind of SD case external libraries into our code.

65
00:04:56,940 --> 00:05:04,900
So whenever we deal with this kind of external libraries the code that is written by other people that

66
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:12,130
we want to integrate in our project we are going to use parts and in order to do that we are going to

67
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:14,770
learn something called Cocoa pots.

68
00:05:14,770 --> 00:05:22,930
It's a tool to utilize pores easily because we had to have this in our computer in order to work with

69
00:05:22,930 --> 00:05:28,440
parts so that we can easily integrate every project in our own project.

70
00:05:28,990 --> 00:05:32,270
And this is not only valid for a fire base as well.

71
00:05:32,290 --> 00:05:37,510
We are going to use this a lot in other libraries from now on.

72
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:44,830
So we have to just deal with this part and then we have to call this bomb line like fire firebase app

73
00:05:44,840 --> 00:05:49,410
that configure and I'm showing you all this documentation.

74
00:05:49,420 --> 00:05:57,310
I can easily come and do this by on my own I show you how it's done but I suggest you follow the documentation

75
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:04,930
as well so that you get the habit of following documentation because you're going to be working with

76
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:12,370
other libraries later on when you're in AoS developer than but we have seen in the course.

77
00:06:12,940 --> 00:06:16,710
So here we have something called Coco Pops as I say.

78
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:19,820
So the web address is Cocoa Puffs dot arc.

79
00:06:19,940 --> 00:06:27,810
If you come to this website you will see how to install cocoa pods on your computer on your Mac OS.

80
00:06:27,910 --> 00:06:30,740
So here we see our comments.

81
00:06:30,820 --> 00:06:34,240
And remember we have used terminal before.

82
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,120
So that's what we're going to use in this lecture as well.

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:45,340
We're going to use terminal to run this install cocoa pods comment and we're going to use terminal to

84
00:06:45,370 --> 00:06:48,710
initialize pods and integrate everything.

85
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:55,450
So make sure you close your X code project because we will be integrating some new files to it and then

86
00:06:55,450 --> 00:06:58,630
search for terminal as we have done before.

87
00:06:58,660 --> 00:07:03,630
All you have to do is just press command and space on your keyboard on his terminal.

88
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:08,510
And we have seen how to use this terminal right in the get section.

89
00:07:08,590 --> 00:07:15,310
So if you have skipped it I really suggest you go back and watch it so that you know how to work with

90
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:16,230
terminal.

91
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,430
But I'm going to explain the basics one more time in case you missed it and if you don't want to go

92
00:07:21,430 --> 00:07:25,080
back and but I'm going to do this fast.

93
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:33,460
OK so this is a terminal and if you write a command here like clear it gets executed it's as long as

94
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:35,330
it makes sense of course.

95
00:07:35,590 --> 00:07:42,840
And either need to work in order to make this cocoa pods work in our computer we have to download it.

96
00:07:43,570 --> 00:07:51,670
And it asks us to run this comment pseudo GAM is still cocoa pots if you write these and hit enter it

97
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:54,770
will download the cocoa pods for you.

98
00:07:54,850 --> 00:07:56,770
It will ask you for your password.

99
00:07:56,770 --> 00:07:58,400
This is your Mac password.

100
00:07:58,420 --> 00:08:04,000
You type it and it will show as if it's not writing but it's for security.

101
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:11,260
If you write it and hit enter it will accept it and it will just start downloading the cocoa bots in

102
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:12,750
your computer.

103
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:20,200
So this is kind of going fast for me but it was already installed on my computer so I believe it's just

104
00:08:20,200 --> 00:08:22,630
get it just got updated.

105
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:29,650
Maybe it will take a little me time for you and this come out goes like this pseudo gaming stole cocoa

106
00:08:29,650 --> 00:08:36,690
pods and this is the comment that we use actually to install repositories in our mac.

107
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:43,670
Like if we if I want to add something else I could either say pseudo game install something else.

108
00:08:44,500 --> 00:08:44,870
OK.

109
00:08:44,890 --> 00:08:51,160
Since now we have the cocoa pods we can actually initialize the pod file and download the file your

110
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:53,980
base as the case to our computer.

111
00:08:53,980 --> 00:08:58,720
So let me clear the screen and go back to our firebase documentation OK.

112
00:08:58,750 --> 00:09:01,280
We're down with the cocoa pods right now.

113
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:06,460
It says that you have to see in your project directory and what is a seed.

114
00:09:06,520 --> 00:09:08,030
We have seen it before.

115
00:09:08,050 --> 00:09:16,300
It stands for change directory so we can go from one directory to another and we can see the content

116
00:09:16,300 --> 00:09:24,390
of that folder and we can initialize a pod and we can write whatever we want inside of that pod and

117
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:31,620
then we can run this pod install command to install these pods in our current folder.

118
00:09:31,810 --> 00:09:33,580
So let's do that.

119
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:41,860
Remember if we run unless or C.D. we can go back and forth between the folders and file system for example

120
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:42,720
if I write that.

121
00:09:42,730 --> 00:09:46,450
It will show me the available content inside of that folder.

122
00:09:46,570 --> 00:09:52,640
For example I want to go to downloads folder because that's via my I s complete folder is.

123
00:09:52,750 --> 00:10:02,400
So I'm going to write CDE downloads and now I mean site to download so now wi fi say unless I will just

124
00:10:02,400 --> 00:10:07,890
see the downloads contents and remember if you want to go to desktop for instance you have to write

125
00:10:07,890 --> 00:10:13,050
desktop that capitalized D as you see in here.

126
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:19,520
So if I say unless if I open my downloads you will see this contents.

127
00:10:19,530 --> 00:10:26,370
As you can see if I open my downloads folder These are the real contents that I see my downloads folder.

128
00:10:26,400 --> 00:10:34,050
So I want to go to these IOW complete folders so if I write IRS and hit tab it will auto complete it

129
00:10:34,050 --> 00:10:43,050
for me because for spaces we have some kind of extra spatial syntax in here as a reverse slash I can

130
00:10:43,050 --> 00:10:46,030
just hit tab I need to load to complete it for me.

131
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:49,190
Now I'm inside of IO is complete.

132
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:56,640
Now if I say unless I will see all of these files and folders but I just want to go to insta clone firebase.

133
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,290
If I write ins and a tablet follow to complete it for me.

134
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:02,870
And now I clicked here.

135
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:12,660
I mean side of this folder and this is where I want to actually you run this pod in its combatants.

136
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:15,930
And remember we have to say pod in it.

137
00:11:15,930 --> 00:11:23,840
It will initialize a pod File for us so that we can edit this file and we can download whatever we want.

138
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:31,170
So if you run this part in it then let me go back to here one more time.

139
00:11:31,170 --> 00:11:35,040
Let me go back to Io complete the clone firebase.

140
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,040
Now as you can see we have the pod files.

141
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:39,820
OK.

142
00:11:39,960 --> 00:11:47,390
We can actually open this file right now and edit it in a way that we want in order to do that.

143
00:11:47,400 --> 00:11:50,370
I'm going to right click and say open with texted said it.

144
00:11:50,400 --> 00:11:51,630
OK.

145
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:55,470
So this is our default pod files.

146
00:11:55,590 --> 00:11:59,250
So let me zoom in a little bit so we can see better.

147
00:11:59,490 --> 00:12:03,930
OK so let me make this a little bit bigger.

148
00:12:03,960 --> 00:12:04,620
Yes.

149
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:10,410
This is what we want to use frameworks line hit some entries.

150
00:12:10,440 --> 00:12:19,440
So we will have some place that is very I want to copy and paste the SDK names pod names so here for

151
00:12:19,440 --> 00:12:23,640
example it asks us to import firebase analytics.

152
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:27,130
I'm going to copy and paste it in here.

153
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:36,600
So whatever I want to download I'm going to paste in this pod file and this is not the only module that

154
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:39,670
I want to go ahead and get why.

155
00:12:39,810 --> 00:12:45,000
Because firebase actually provides modules you know separate parts.

156
00:12:45,030 --> 00:12:51,290
For example we will have a pod for fires stored for storage for authentication.

157
00:12:51,330 --> 00:12:53,130
Vi will de do that.

158
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,030
Why does it even bother to provide us with different pots.

159
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:04,100
Because maybe we're going to use only authentication feature or firebase in our app.

160
00:13:04,110 --> 00:13:06,660
We're not going to use the fi your store.

161
00:13:06,660 --> 00:13:12,670
We're not going to use storage so we don't want to make our app too big.

162
00:13:12,780 --> 00:13:15,160
So that's in a very logical way.

163
00:13:15,160 --> 00:13:20,700
They just provide us with different parts so that we can get whatever we want.

164
00:13:20,820 --> 00:13:28,210
We shouldn't get everything in the fire base in order to limit our AB size.

165
00:13:28,260 --> 00:13:35,730
So if you go to authentication and I guess you can say get started or you can just click on the first

166
00:13:35,730 --> 00:13:44,490
line here and you're going to find the necessary parts in order to integrate firebase authentication

167
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,110
in our project.

168
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:48,870
We have already got analytics.

169
00:13:49,110 --> 00:13:55,410
So I'm going to go for old and in the five years store as well if you come over here to introduction

170
00:13:55,410 --> 00:14:01,460
and get started and not a real time database by the way we're going to go for five years sir.

171
00:14:01,490 --> 00:14:04,430
And I'm Max I'm going to explain the difference between them.

172
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:12,660
But for right now just know that fire stories never so far your store is the how technology available

173
00:14:12,960 --> 00:14:14,880
real time data bases old new.

174
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:17,450
So we're going to go for five years sir.

175
00:14:17,790 --> 00:14:23,040
So let me copy these parts and paces in my project here.

176
00:14:23,040 --> 00:14:26,510
So we're downloading car and fire sir.

177
00:14:26,670 --> 00:14:30,450
And then the last thing that we want to get is this storage.

178
00:14:30,450 --> 00:14:31,370
OK.

179
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:35,010
So let's click on get started and see if we can get this.

180
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:37,280
Yes we already have analytics.

181
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:40,880
So I'm going to go for a storage and that's it.

182
00:14:40,890 --> 00:14:42,890
That's all I want to get.

183
00:14:43,140 --> 00:14:47,610
Firebase analytics old car fires storage storage.

184
00:14:48,270 --> 00:14:50,340
So let me causes after saving.

185
00:14:50,640 --> 00:15:00,540
OK so let me go back to my original documentation here by clicking on the back button so let me hit

186
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:00,990
tab.

187
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:01,520
Yeah.

188
00:15:01,650 --> 00:15:04,920
So this is what we want to run next.

189
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,860
So we have to run.

190
00:15:06,940 --> 00:15:10,480
Party installed make sure that you save and close the party file.

191
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:15,930
Make sure your ex code is closed and right party install and hit enter.

192
00:15:16,470 --> 00:15:25,740
So this will download these dependencies DNC case one by one and we will need to do that just once.

193
00:15:25,740 --> 00:15:32,640
By the way we're going to do that once and then we can go back to our ex growth project so that we can

194
00:15:32,640 --> 00:15:35,240
work on that every time you open the project.

195
00:15:35,430 --> 00:15:42,870
And this is going to take some time by the way because firebase is big and we're going to be downloading

196
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,130
five modules.

197
00:15:44,130 --> 00:15:48,510
So feel free to pause the video and come back when you're done.

198
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:55,950
So when you download a dependency for the first time it will show its line in green.

199
00:15:56,400 --> 00:16:02,610
So as you can see we're seeing this in green and we're seeing the others in green when they're done.

200
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:04,660
So we are seeing everything in green.

201
00:16:04,710 --> 00:16:08,610
If I run poly install one more time they will be all in black.

202
00:16:08,640 --> 00:16:09,340
Okay.

203
00:16:09,630 --> 00:16:18,180
So these are all integrated in my ex called Project right now we are done that those terminals so I'm

204
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:25,710
going to close this and I'm going to come back to my I guess folder so in instead closed file your base

205
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,040
here.

206
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:29,350
Now we have two files.

207
00:16:29,580 --> 00:16:35,370
These are going to use this workspace rather than the X code project.

208
00:16:35,370 --> 00:16:38,500
So what are what is the difference between those two.

209
00:16:38,700 --> 00:16:44,680
So X workspace actually contains both the project and the parts.

210
00:16:44,700 --> 00:16:46,740
So make sure you open the workspace.

211
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,290
If you open the project from now on it won't work.

212
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:57,840
So make sure you select the right files so we won't have a problem in here.

213
00:16:57,870 --> 00:17:05,460
So let me make this into a full screen so that we can see what's in in the left hand pane as you can

214
00:17:05,460 --> 00:17:10,310
see we still have the view controller and the old files that we used to have a right time.

215
00:17:10,410 --> 00:17:13,770
But we also have the pause here and as well.

216
00:17:13,770 --> 00:17:19,290
So if you open this frameworks if you open the files and folders you're going to see this.

217
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:20,720
These are the files.

218
00:17:20,730 --> 00:17:29,990
These are the firebase project that we have downloaded so we can use it in our app so that's all for

219
00:17:30,020 --> 00:17:32,870
integrating fire base in our app.

220
00:17:32,900 --> 00:17:36,000
We're going to have to do a little bit of configuration.

221
00:17:36,050 --> 00:17:38,650
We're going to do it in the next lecture.
