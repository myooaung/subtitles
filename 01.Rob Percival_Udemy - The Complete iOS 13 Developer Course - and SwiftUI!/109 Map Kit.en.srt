Hi.

2
00:00:01,420 --> 00:00:07,570
We didn't this lecture re going to start building our travel book and first thing to do will be to learn

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:08,950
how to work with maps.

4
00:00:08,950 --> 00:00:09,970
It's fairly easy.

5
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,120
You just bring in one view and you just start working with maps.

6
00:00:14,170 --> 00:00:18,080
Thanks to something called Map kits in the swift.

7
00:00:18,290 --> 00:00:26,380
Okay I'm just going to go ahead and create my project and I'm gonna go for a single weave app as usual.

8
00:00:26,440 --> 00:00:27,310
Okay.

9
00:00:27,580 --> 00:00:34,150
And then here I'm gonna check the used car data one more time because we we will be saving all of this

10
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:37,950
information into car data and for product name.

11
00:00:37,960 --> 00:00:47,390
I'm gonna go for chaebol book so click next and placed is under my OS complete folders.

12
00:00:47,390 --> 00:00:50,080
You can place it wherever you want.

13
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:55,370
And then I'm going to make it into a full screen mode so that we can see better.

14
00:00:55,660 --> 00:01:00,680
And I'm just going to go ahead and show you that we have this travel book.

15
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:06,940
It's called data model but we're not going to go into that right now.

16
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:14,590
We first have to learn how to work with maps then we can just go on and save our information into car

17
00:01:14,590 --> 00:01:18,340
data model because we already know how to work with car data.

18
00:01:18,340 --> 00:01:19,290
Right.

19
00:01:19,330 --> 00:01:27,070
So let's go to storyboards because in order to work with maps we are going to need a map view and it's

20
00:01:27,070 --> 00:01:28,810
fairly easy to work with maps.

21
00:01:28,810 --> 00:01:35,560
You just open your library search for a map and you will see something called Map kit view.

22
00:01:35,760 --> 00:01:36,570
OK.

23
00:01:36,820 --> 00:01:45,100
Just drag and drop the map view as you can see this is a regular view like we used to work with other

24
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:46,910
races before like UI imagery.

25
00:01:46,930 --> 00:01:55,420
You can just drag and drop here and you can stretch it out for the all edges for example you can come

26
00:01:55,420 --> 00:02:02,490
over here and just say 0 0 0 4 all constraints it will stretch out all to the edges.

27
00:02:02,530 --> 00:02:09,820
Now when we run this when we set this up we will see a whole huge map covering up all the view controller

28
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:12,060
in order to set this up.

29
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:20,050
I'm going to open my weave controller in an assistant editor and I'm going to define his map by dragging

30
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:23,740
and dropping here and I'm going to call this map for you.

31
00:02:23,950 --> 00:02:24,980
OK.

32
00:02:25,090 --> 00:02:28,550
And once we do that we'll get an error.

33
00:02:28,630 --> 00:02:31,080
So we have to do some set up first.

34
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:33,820
And it's fairly easy to do that.

35
00:02:33,970 --> 00:02:42,190
So we get to how to use we did load because we have to set the delegate of this map view to the view

36
00:02:42,190 --> 00:02:44,940
controller like we do in the table to use.

37
00:02:44,980 --> 00:02:45,940
Right.

38
00:02:45,940 --> 00:02:54,100
So this is all we have to do to make this work as you can see this is saying undeclared type.

39
00:02:54,100 --> 00:03:02,020
So let me just say map we have that delegate is south and this is not going away because we have to

40
00:03:02,410 --> 00:03:08,800
make our view controller delegates of map and K map kids view as Vo.

41
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:18,310
But in order to do that we first have to import map kit so import the map kids make map we've got delegate

42
00:03:18,550 --> 00:03:29,710
equal to south and then come over here to we have controller and just say I'm j k I'm K map yes this

43
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:32,970
form M.K. map view delegate.

44
00:03:33,310 --> 00:03:38,020
So this is exactly like what we do in the table we use right.

45
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:45,310
So we set delegate to solve and we make our way controllers an actual delegate of the related view.

46
00:03:45,310 --> 00:03:52,910
So part map kit say this is an M K map view delegate and then map you that delegate is south.

47
00:03:54,460 --> 00:04:01,270
So later on we're going to use another delegates as well because we're going to need a lot of functions

48
00:04:01,510 --> 00:04:09,140
to be called in our wheel controller but for right now this is all we need to make this map run.

49
00:04:09,220 --> 00:04:17,530
So if I run this in my simulator that I will get a map and it won't show me any location of the user

50
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:24,100
it won't show me in a specific location we're just going to see the map and we can wander around the

51
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:32,310
map we can zoom means zoom out whatever we want but it won't do any action because we haven't defined

52
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:33,400
one yet.

53
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:35,260
For example we're in the Europe.

54
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:37,540
We can zoom in we can zoom out.

55
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:43,390
We can do whatever we want with this map but we're just displaying the map right now.

56
00:04:43,390 --> 00:04:46,220
We're not doing anything fancy.

57
00:04:46,480 --> 00:04:53,380
And let me zoom in so let's see if we can see the details over here as you can see the see names are

58
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,870
appearing here right now.

59
00:04:55,870 --> 00:04:57,920
So it seems fine.

60
00:04:58,180 --> 00:05:06,150
I believe this is all for this lecture we're going to stop here and within the next following lectures

61
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:13,980
we're going to learn how to get the user location so we can start this map actually at the user's location.

62
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:22,590
And then after that we going to learn how to pin this map view in order to tag the view and get the

63
00:05:22,590 --> 00:05:28,920
coordinates of that specific view so that we can later on at the navigation to it.

64
00:05:29,010 --> 00:05:31,470
Let's do all of this in the following lecture.
