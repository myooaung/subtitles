00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,780
Hi within this lecture re going to start building our catch the Kenny game.

2
00:00:06,030 --> 00:00:11,610
I hope you managed to build it yourself or I hope you tried at least.

3
00:00:11,610 --> 00:00:16,930
So I'm going to show you my way of doing this so I'm going to go for a single recap.

4
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:24,630
I'm going to name this catch the Kenny K so this is going to be our game and I'm going to create this.

5
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:32,210
So before he starts I should tell you that this is not the only way of doing this game so I'm going

6
00:00:32,210 --> 00:00:33,990
to show you the easiest way.

7
00:00:33,990 --> 00:00:41,190
This is not the most efficient way or this is not the optimum way of doing this but this is the easiest

8
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:41,520
way.

9
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:48,680
So maybe you came up with a completely different idea that works and that is perfectly OK.

10
00:00:48,930 --> 00:00:49,350
All right.

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:57,050
So I'm going to go for my main story board because we're going to start that the design of this app.

12
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:04,800
So basically we're going to need a kidney image and I'm not going to use one image in this app.

13
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,890
I'm going to use nine of them.

14
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:12,870
And in order to estimate the kidney I'm just going to hide them all.

15
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,670
Make them even visible.

16
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:24,090
And then I'm just going to select one and make that visible and this invisible and visible images will

17
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,490
change in time.

18
00:01:25,590 --> 00:01:28,340
And we are going to do that randomly.

19
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:29,020
OK.

20
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:35,880
So you haven't learned how to work with the random numbers but it's fairly easy it's just one line of

21
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:36,770
code.

22
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,290
And I'm going to show you how to do that later on.

23
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:41,190
Don't worry.

24
00:01:41,730 --> 00:01:46,260
So we're going to go for Kenny and we're going to find an image on line.

25
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:47,040
OK.

26
00:01:47,670 --> 00:01:49,590
So any image will do.

27
00:01:49,590 --> 00:01:57,100
But I'm trying to find something that is not too big so that's it.

28
00:01:57,170 --> 00:02:03,480
We're going to use nine of them in our app so that it won't take so much space.

29
00:02:03,480 --> 00:02:04,560
So that will do.

30
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:12,360
I'm going to name this Kenny and I'm going to go to a sets and that I'm going to drag this into my assets

31
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:20,240
and put that over there so I can reach this if I have an image view in my main storyboard.

32
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:22,620
So let me create an image for you.

33
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:29,790
Let me go to library or here and just search for Image view and drag and drop one or here.

34
00:02:29,790 --> 00:02:32,580
So we had to make this a little bit smaller.

35
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:33,020
OK.

36
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:40,780
Because we're going to use nine of them as I said to let me go to attributes and try to choose Katy.

37
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:42,950
So that's good right.

38
00:02:42,960 --> 00:02:48,040
We can make sure that this will fit three in a row.

39
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:51,500
So let me copy and paste and see if that fits.

40
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:55,520
So let me copy one more and that's OK.

41
00:02:55,520 --> 00:02:59,370
Right so we can have our row like this.

42
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:04,410
And then later on I can select three of them and copy and paste one more time.

43
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:07,520
So this looks good right.

44
00:03:07,530 --> 00:03:08,920
This is in line.

45
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:10,980
And let me do that one more time.

46
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:15,020
So we have nine caddies.

47
00:03:15,270 --> 00:03:16,680
So this is perfect.

48
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,530
So what do we need else.

49
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,970
Let me make this a little bit central over here.

50
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:26,140
So we need our score label.

51
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:33,240
You need our time label and in here I'm going to select one of them to show to the user.

52
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:42,140
And I'm going to hide the other kiddies so that in real time it will look like the Caylee is animating.

53
00:03:42,750 --> 00:03:51,690
So let me bring this label ebb and let me make this a little bit bigger so that I can display the time

54
00:03:51,690 --> 00:03:53,250
and I can display the score.

55
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:55,610
So first will be our type.

56
00:03:56,100 --> 00:03:59,880
So it can start with Turkey for example.

57
00:03:59,880 --> 00:04:06,270
I'm not going to go for a turkey I'm just going to go for 10 in our app because I don't want to wait

58
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:11,430
30 seconds just to try just to test this app.

59
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:20,040
So let me copy and paste and make this one a little bit smaller this time rather than time I'm going

60
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:22,650
to display our score.

61
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,220
So this is OK.

62
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:25,210
I believe.

63
00:04:25,260 --> 00:04:29,400
Time as score will be sufficient at this point.

64
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:36,910
So maybe we can just show the number of the time so rather than save time.

65
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,340
I believe this way.

66
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:39,800
This will be more catchy.

67
00:04:39,830 --> 00:04:45,330
So this will get the focus off the user when he or she plays the game.

68
00:04:46,230 --> 00:04:51,540
So here I'm going to copy and paste because we need another label.

69
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,440
And in this label I'm going to display the high score.

70
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,580
So we're going to have a high score as well.

71
00:04:59,190 --> 00:05:05,820
And this will star the highest score that has ever been made by the users.

72
00:05:05,820 --> 00:05:07,460
They are playing this game.

73
00:05:08,130 --> 00:05:10,140
So let me select this view.

74
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:16,440
Okay and then give the constraints so a reset to suggested constraints.

75
00:05:16,620 --> 00:05:24,780
And in this kind of game where you have a lot of views like this maybe you may want to go with width

76
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:32,160
and height constraints as well so that it will look the same in different kinds different sizes.

77
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:32,800
Okay.

78
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,370
In order to do that you can come over here and just select the width and height as well.

79
00:05:38,370 --> 00:05:46,170
But right now I'm not going to deal with the layout so much because I want to focus on coding side of

80
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,500
this game.

81
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,290
So let me play this on my iPhone X are if it looks good on my iPhone X are.

82
00:05:52,290 --> 00:05:56,580
That would be sufficient for me at least at this moment.

83
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:04,680
Okay so run this on your simulator and see how it looks like on your phone.

84
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:08,820
So it seems like it's going to take a.

85
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:16,620
So meanwhile let me open the assistant editor on the right hand side so we can define these views into

86
00:06:16,620 --> 00:06:17,840
our coding sections.

87
00:06:17,850 --> 00:06:21,920
So let me choose we have controller for the right hand side.

88
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,100
And let me go to main storyboard.

89
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:33,330
So we're going to have to define all of these images and labels so simulator didn't even start yet.

90
00:06:33,330 --> 00:06:39,210
So let me start by dragging in this time label.

91
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,700
So this is where we display the time so I'm going to call this time label.

92
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:45,170
OK.

93
00:06:45,330 --> 00:06:50,070
And again we cannot see the game yet.

94
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:54,120
I believe it's taking it's time to open the simulator.

95
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:54,750
Oh yeah.

96
00:06:54,750 --> 00:06:58,830
Now we see it and as you can see it looks fine to me.

97
00:06:58,920 --> 00:07:02,700
We can see the total game we can see the kidneys and everything.

98
00:07:02,730 --> 00:07:06,690
So I'm going to focus on coding side as I said before.

99
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:14,310
So let me defined my score label over here and for the last label I'm going to go for high score.

100
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:22,020
So this is going to be high score label and then later on I'm going to bring in the images.

101
00:07:22,020 --> 00:07:26,280
So there are nine of them and we have to do this one by one.

102
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:29,100
So I'm I'm just gonna name them.

103
00:07:29,100 --> 00:07:34,190
Kenny one Kenny to Kenny tree because we want to make things simple.

104
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:38,160
K we're going to work with all of these images.

105
00:07:38,310 --> 00:07:46,470
So I believe we can just call them Kenny 1 Kenny to Kenny 3 game and then again there are some other

106
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:54,410
ways to make this app with only one Kenny but by using animation by using other techniques.

107
00:07:54,510 --> 00:07:57,730
But this is the easiest way to go.

108
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:04,710
So I'm just going to focus on that one for right now after you complete this whole course you will be

109
00:08:04,710 --> 00:08:12,420
able to do whatever you want with swift and IRS development maybe then you can come back and have a

110
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,780
complete different way to do this on your own.

111
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:23,140
OK so Kenny eight and Kenny nine so the last one.

112
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:26,440
So here we go are ready I believe.

113
00:08:26,520 --> 00:08:28,160
So let me close this.

114
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:33,520
We have already given the constraints so I can go back to my we controller.

115
00:08:33,840 --> 00:08:39,240
So let me delete all of the spaces in here so we can have a decent look.

116
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:42,990
We are going to have a lot of code have a lot of variables in this.

117
00:08:43,050 --> 00:08:47,280
So we have to make teams in a tidier Ray.

118
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,180
So let's stop here and continue within the next lecture.
