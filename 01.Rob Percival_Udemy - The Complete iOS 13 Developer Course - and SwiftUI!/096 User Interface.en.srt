00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:01,580
Hi.

2
00:00:01,670 --> 00:00:02,750
We didn't this lecture.

3
00:00:02,750 --> 00:00:07,410
We're going to go ahead and create our user interface in the main that storyboard.

4
00:00:08,310 --> 00:00:10,530
So what do we have in the ZAP.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:15,960
First we need to have a table view in which we can display the names of the yards.

6
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:16,710
Right.

7
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:20,650
So let's open our library and drag and drop one table view.

8
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:28,060
So it will have the constraints of 0 0 0 so that it will reach out to the edges.

9
00:00:28,110 --> 00:00:28,990
Right.

10
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:36,120
And are we not going to have anything else in this view controller actually we're just okay.

11
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:38,570
Too good to go with this table view.

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,910
And then of course we going to add another UI view controller in which we will display the details.

13
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:51,150
But for right now let me give the zero zero zero constraints so that our first free controller will

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:51,960
be ready.

15
00:00:52,710 --> 00:01:00,270
So remember we had this UI navigation bar over here in which we have this plus button when we click

16
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,740
on this the new details we have controller opens.

17
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:12,040
So let me embed in an aviation controller to my view controller so that we will have this bar.

18
00:01:12,370 --> 00:01:15,030
OK I'm going to add a button here.

19
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:17,730
I'm going to show you how to do that later on.

20
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:27,420
But right now I need another wi controller so that if I make a Segway from this to another one it would

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,730
have the UI tab bar as well.

22
00:01:29,730 --> 00:01:39,300
So let me drag and drop from your controller over here and let me align this a little bit so I can do

23
00:01:39,300 --> 00:01:42,070
a Segway from here to there.

24
00:01:42,090 --> 00:01:43,840
I'm going to make it show.

25
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:47,170
And as you can see we got the back button here.

26
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:50,810
So let me give you an identifier to this Segway.

27
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,420
I can call these details wi controllers I'm going to go for two details V.S. and I'm all doing this

28
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:02,450
kind of fast because we have been doing this for a lot of times right.

29
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:06,910
So let me create another file in here.

30
00:02:06,970 --> 00:02:08,000
Okay.

31
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,650
And it's going to be a cocoa touch glass because I'm going to create this as a UI view controller subclass.

32
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:18,910
I'm going to connect this to my newly created view controller.

33
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:21,080
So let me name those details we see.

34
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,170
OK.

35
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:24,460
And make sure the target is selected.

36
00:02:24,790 --> 00:02:29,840
And then I can create and put those files in my folder.

37
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:37,750
So let's go to main storyboard so that we can connect that file to our details view controller.

38
00:02:37,750 --> 00:02:43,750
So let's choose this view controller and let's go to the identity inspector in which we will find the

39
00:02:43,750 --> 00:02:45,450
class and assign it to it.

40
00:02:46,870 --> 00:02:52,100
And we cannot see the details view controller.

41
00:02:52,180 --> 00:02:54,700
And here we have a question mark.

42
00:02:55,240 --> 00:03:00,980
So I believe there is something going on something like a bug in X code.

43
00:03:01,020 --> 00:03:04,030
I'm going to show you have to come over this problem.

44
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:07,650
So let me click and manually write this.

45
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:12,020
So if I click on this button it takes me to details we see.

46
00:03:12,010 --> 00:03:18,910
However I am still suspicious that if if there is a question mark in here it's never a good sign.

47
00:03:19,510 --> 00:03:26,510
So best way to understand is to create our views and try to connect them with our real controller file.

48
00:03:26,860 --> 00:03:28,900
OK so let's do that.

49
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,460
What do we have in details we see we have to have an image right.

50
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:42,490
First of all so let me drag and drop one image view to here and make it a little bit bigger so that

51
00:03:42,490 --> 00:03:45,150
our art will be displayed in here.

52
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:52,600
And the next I'm going to need some text fields right in which I will display the name of yards and

53
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:55,600
the artists and the year.

54
00:03:55,600 --> 00:04:02,500
So let me make this a little bit higher over here and a little bit bigger.

55
00:04:02,670 --> 00:04:04,540
So that's good.

56
00:04:04,540 --> 00:04:05,590
Let me go to you.

57
00:04:05,590 --> 00:04:09,250
Attributes and find place holder and called his name.

58
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:11,890
So this will be the name of the art.

59
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:13,240
That's law.

60
00:04:13,240 --> 00:04:20,740
Let me zoom in a little bit so I have to copy this on pace this because I'm going to go for an artist's

61
00:04:20,740 --> 00:04:22,200
name in here OK.

62
00:04:22,300 --> 00:04:31,660
I'm going to call these artists and also I'm going to copy and paste one more time to go for year.

63
00:04:31,690 --> 00:04:35,290
So are we going to take note of the year as well.

64
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,230
So let's say a year.

65
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:38,310
OK.

66
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:42,390
And finally we we need actually a save bottom right.

67
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,230
So that we can save all this information into core data.

68
00:04:46,300 --> 00:04:51,680
So drag and drop a button and make this a little bit bigger and make it central.

69
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,740
And then I'm going to call this save and hit enter.

70
00:04:56,770 --> 00:04:58,930
So that looks good.

71
00:05:00,220 --> 00:05:09,100
So here we go who we re going to reset to suggested call strains and this kind of setup in which our

72
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:14,590
user actually chooses their own pictures rather than we're providing them.

73
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:19,170
I suggest you try div width and height constraint as well.

74
00:05:19,630 --> 00:05:26,580
Because we cannot know the size of the picture that is going to come from the user.

75
00:05:26,590 --> 00:05:27,240
OK.

76
00:05:27,310 --> 00:05:35,620
So if you go for a fixed with height constraint in here by checking these two boxes and adding these

77
00:05:35,620 --> 00:05:39,640
two constraints it would be much more concrete.

78
00:05:40,090 --> 00:05:44,660
So as you can see it breaks up the view a little bit.

79
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:51,160
So in order to overcome this problem I'm going to manually drag and make this a little bit bigger.

80
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:52,210
OK.

81
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:59,530
And then it will show us some orange constraints which means that these constraints are not yet updated.

82
00:05:59,530 --> 00:06:05,190
So let me go over here and say update constraints constants.

83
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:09,450
So let's see if we have another problem.

84
00:06:09,490 --> 00:06:14,590
This is the UI image view is now okay with width and height constraints.

85
00:06:14,980 --> 00:06:18,640
But I believe we have some problem in below.

86
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:19,960
Let me see.

87
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:21,400
Do you have problem in here.

88
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:22,160
No.

89
00:06:22,180 --> 00:06:24,670
Let me see the Web problem in text fields.

90
00:06:24,670 --> 00:06:27,610
No but we have some in Save button.

91
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,370
So it's a little bit to the left.

92
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:38,710
So let me go over here and make this a little bit bigger and drag it to the central.

93
00:06:38,710 --> 00:06:40,740
And let me do update constraints.

94
00:06:40,750 --> 00:06:45,130
Constance again so that's good.

95
00:06:45,130 --> 00:06:51,640
Of course we can make this view much better but I'm not going to spend any more time on this because

96
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:55,090
we may still have a bug in here.

97
00:06:55,150 --> 00:07:02,770
Let me try to understand thus by adding this assistant editor and choosing details we see from the right

98
00:07:02,770 --> 00:07:03,730
hand side.

99
00:07:03,820 --> 00:07:06,570
And let me delete all of these comments.

100
00:07:07,150 --> 00:07:09,600
And let me have some room in here.

101
00:07:09,700 --> 00:07:13,860
And on the left hand side we have our details we have comptroller.

102
00:07:13,900 --> 00:07:17,170
So let me drag and drop image view.

103
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:18,560
Yeah it seems okay.

104
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:19,480
Yeah right.

105
00:07:19,510 --> 00:07:26,470
So we have the imagery we have this circular thing that is filled up so it means that everything is

106
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:27,230
OK.

107
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:30,250
So let me bring up the name text.

108
00:07:30,640 --> 00:07:32,110
So far so good.

109
00:07:32,260 --> 00:07:33,690
It's going on.

110
00:07:33,730 --> 00:07:38,410
Let me bring in the artist's text.

111
00:07:38,860 --> 00:07:43,180
And for the final thing I'm going to bring in the year tax as well.

112
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:46,180
So that's working.

113
00:07:46,180 --> 00:07:50,530
Let me try to define the save button as an action.

114
00:07:50,530 --> 00:07:59,800
So say button clicked OK and here we go we have a problem in here as you can see the circle is not filled

115
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:07,690
as in here it means that these outlet is not connected even though I made this connection it doesn't

116
00:08:07,690 --> 00:08:11,140
work because this is a bug actually.

117
00:08:11,260 --> 00:08:19,050
And in order to make this right I'm going to go for outlets here and as you can see it seems connected.

118
00:08:19,060 --> 00:08:22,900
Let me choose these details we see and go to the outlets.

119
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:23,590
And here you go.

120
00:08:23,590 --> 00:08:25,660
We have a lot of warnings.

121
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:30,220
So there is no reason to get this warning that unless there is a bug.

122
00:08:30,470 --> 00:08:30,930
OK.

123
00:08:30,940 --> 00:08:37,770
Because we made everything right and we should solve this problem before we proceed because.

124
00:08:38,650 --> 00:08:46,870
And by the way if you're not experiencing this kind of problem that we see this outlet is not being

125
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:52,330
connected or something you should not do what I'm about to do I'm just going to delete all of these

126
00:08:52,330 --> 00:08:55,770
connections and define this from beginning.

127
00:08:56,050 --> 00:09:03,640
However you should learn how to solve this problem because you may experience this bug for some time

128
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:07,390
because it's been going on for some years right now.

129
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:10,390
It's not related to latest version.

130
00:09:10,390 --> 00:09:15,550
So I believe this is good for you to understand what causes this problem.

131
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,270
So I'm going to delete every connection in here except the Segway.

132
00:09:20,290 --> 00:09:21,550
OK.

133
00:09:21,550 --> 00:09:25,410
And as I delete as you can see this is not field anymore.

134
00:09:25,420 --> 00:09:28,090
It means that the connection is broken.

135
00:09:28,090 --> 00:09:36,430
So I'm going to delete all of these functions and outlets and I'm going to solve this problem by coming

136
00:09:36,460 --> 00:09:39,830
over and fixing the details V.C..

137
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:48,940
OK so if you right click on the main story board if you go to open as we're opening this as an interface

138
00:09:48,940 --> 00:09:49,540
builder.

139
00:09:50,170 --> 00:09:56,200
But right now I'm not going to open this as interface builder but I'm going to open the source code

140
00:09:57,010 --> 00:10:00,370
and the source code is actually an E email code.

141
00:10:00,460 --> 00:10:08,110
So if you work with Android Studio for Android development you know what an example is this kind of

142
00:10:08,110 --> 00:10:12,340
a code representation of the main storyboards.

143
00:10:12,490 --> 00:10:20,020
But we don't generally used this because it's not necessary to use this and it's not very user friendly

144
00:10:20,020 --> 00:10:28,360
in the X code but if you come across a situation like this we have to come to the source code and define

145
00:10:28,360 --> 00:10:32,190
some values ourselves in order to solve this problem.

146
00:10:32,200 --> 00:10:36,130
For example we see the view controller definition in here.

147
00:10:36,220 --> 00:10:44,800
We have some custom module custom module provider under the V controller and below we have the details

148
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:52,480
we see and again we have the view controller custom class and scene member I.D. but we don't have some

149
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,140
of the members some of the values that we had about.

150
00:10:56,950 --> 00:11:05,110
So I'm going to add those values manually and in order to do that I'm going to copy this and paste this

151
00:11:05,110 --> 00:11:09,310
below so we can compare them side by side.

152
00:11:09,790 --> 00:11:11,140
So let me paste here.

153
00:11:11,170 --> 00:11:13,360
I'm going to delete this later on.

154
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:21,010
As you can see both has ideas both has custom class but deep details we see doesn't have this custom

155
00:11:21,010 --> 00:11:23,650
module and custom module provider.

156
00:11:24,340 --> 00:11:30,470
So I'm going to copy these values from here okay and I'm going to paste is in the same place that he

157
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:32,530
has to be in here.

158
00:11:33,850 --> 00:11:35,870
So that's now OK.

159
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:44,110
It has seen member I.D. so I'm going to delete this and this is how this bug gets fixed.

160
00:11:44,110 --> 00:11:49,560
So if I do product clean and product builds it will get synchronized.

161
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:57,800
OK and then we can try to define our outlets and define our action in the details we have controller

162
00:11:57,800 --> 00:11:58,790
now.

163
00:11:58,790 --> 00:12:03,240
So let me go over here I say open as interface builder.

164
00:12:03,620 --> 00:12:09,040
And again if you're not experiencing this problem you should not bother doing this.

165
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:14,660
But as a general information I believe it's good to know for you.

166
00:12:14,690 --> 00:12:16,900
So let me go to details of you.

167
00:12:17,240 --> 00:12:26,930
And let me try to bring this save in here as an action and call this Save button clicked OK and here

168
00:12:26,930 --> 00:12:27,350
you go.

169
00:12:27,380 --> 00:12:29,690
Now this is Connect.

170
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:33,440
So I believe the bug has now been fixed.

171
00:12:34,010 --> 00:12:39,600
So let me create my other outlets as well like image for you.

172
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:48,200
And let's go for a name text OK name text and let's go for artists.

173
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:49,090
OK.

174
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,310
So let me drag and drop here.

175
00:12:51,450 --> 00:13:00,430
Artists text and then finally year text so year text.

176
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:02,020
So this is now OK.

177
00:13:02,090 --> 00:13:03,200
Right.

178
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,980
Of course we have to make sure that this works.

179
00:13:07,340 --> 00:13:14,450
And in order to do that you can come over here and go to the outlets and you still see these those warnings

180
00:13:14,450 --> 00:13:15,220
here.

181
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,270
But I believe the actual problem has now been resolved.

182
00:13:20,270 --> 00:13:23,460
But we're able to see it.

183
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:26,960
So let me print something here so we can test this.

184
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:34,040
OK in the site button clicks and if it's not fixed it's going to crash because it will not find the

185
00:13:34,040 --> 00:13:35,970
necessary function to call.

186
00:13:36,110 --> 00:13:37,790
Then we hit on save.

187
00:13:38,510 --> 00:13:47,030
So we have to make sure that we define the table view in the we did vote in the controller not in we

188
00:13:47,060 --> 00:13:47,910
did load.

189
00:13:47,960 --> 00:13:49,650
So table view here.

190
00:13:49,700 --> 00:13:50,480
OK.

191
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:52,650
And we are done with this.

192
00:13:52,760 --> 00:14:00,440
Now I have to add a button on the bar site here on the right hand side of the bar so that I can click

193
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,820
on this button and it will perform a Segway to bring me here so that I can test if the saved bottom

194
00:14:06,860 --> 00:14:08,040
works.

195
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:10,790
So we're going to do that in the next lecture.
