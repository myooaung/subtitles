Hi within this section we going to create a Foursquare clone beat using pass instead of fire.

2
00:00:08,660 --> 00:00:11,280
So let me show you how this looks.

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:17,940
As you can see there is a username and password text fields here and this is our sign up our sign in

4
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:18,870
page.

5
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:24,620
So if you give any user that you have created previously you can sign it.

6
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,460
Of course you can sign up as well.

7
00:00:26,940 --> 00:00:35,280
So in the stable view we see the previously created places like a restaurant or a pub or a diner or

8
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:37,870
any place that you may want to add.

9
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:45,140
So if you click one of them you will see the image the name the type and some description of that the

10
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:54,090
restaurant doors or that place and in below we see the map and we see where it is located on the map

11
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:02,450
so that we can click on that place and we can navigate from our current place to that place.

12
00:01:02,460 --> 00:01:08,520
This looks like our travel book but it works on cloud server.

13
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:16,260
So if we want to add another place from here we can do it by clicking on this ad buy them and we get

14
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:19,280
to choose a name like Rob Cafe.

15
00:01:19,470 --> 00:01:19,820
OK.

16
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:24,770
So this will be a cafe and for example this will be a student Cafe.

17
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:25,440
OK.

18
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:33,830
If we can select a picture from here then we can click on Next to choose a place from our map.

19
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:34,310
OK.

20
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:42,270
So let me zoom in a little bit so that we can choose a place from here for example if I click over here

21
00:01:42,270 --> 00:01:50,250
for three seconds then it will just add a location here and I can just save it and this will be saved

22
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:52,070
and displayed in my table view.

23
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:54,780
And again this works in cloud.

24
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:55,170
OK.

25
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,110
So this is not specific to my iPhone.

26
00:01:58,110 --> 00:02:04,950
This is not with core data but now we are doing this with cloud server and for cloud server purposes

27
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:07,830
we use parts rather than fire base.

28
00:02:08,310 --> 00:02:14,790
So in here as you can see we have our database we can access all the data's we can change anything that

29
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:15,870
we want.

30
00:02:15,930 --> 00:02:21,900
We are going to see the differences between fiber based on past and we are going to understand why we

31
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,900
choose one on another.

32
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:30,660
And we are going to learn how to use parse and it's back end services in our apps.

33
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:34,860
So now if you're ready let's get started on build our Foursquare clone.
