00:00:00,990 --> 00:00:08,190
Hi within this lecture regarding to set our map we see up so that we can get the current location of

2
00:00:08,190 --> 00:00:15,780
the user so that we can zoom that location and people that will get to choose to create whatever place

3
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:16,470
they want.

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,350
By choosing from the map.

5
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:25,440
OK so you know how this works we're going to have to create a location manager we're going to have to

6
00:00:25,440 --> 00:00:27,160
work with M.K. map delegates.

7
00:00:27,170 --> 00:00:30,570
So let me just bring all of this things in.

8
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,880
So this is going to be m M K map.

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,640
We have delegates and see our location manager delegates.

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:43,770
So if you haven't watched the map section I suggest you go back and watch because we're going to do

11
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,170
some maps specified corporations and lots in this lecture.

12
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,340
So I'm going to say map view that delegates is going to be our turn.

13
00:00:54,500 --> 00:01:01,950
Delegates our we have controller and remember we have to come up with a location manager so that we

14
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:05,120
can actually get the location of the user.

15
00:01:05,130 --> 00:01:12,390
So this is going to be a single location manager and this location manager will again have the delegates

16
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:14,510
of self.

17
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:22,560
So now we can use this map view and the location manager now location manager will have the desired

18
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:24,630
accuracy of the best.

19
00:01:24,630 --> 00:01:32,830
So remember if we write Casey out we have the options here and we wanted the best available accuracy

20
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,830
before and we wanted to write.

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,760
Now remember we have some other reasons to choose other options as well.

22
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:47,900
But right now we don't have them so if you say location manager that request I'm going to request one

23
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:50,000
in use authorization.

24
00:01:50,270 --> 00:01:58,730
So later on I can just say location manager dot start updating location and when we do that.

25
00:01:58,730 --> 00:02:06,230
Remember we have to give some description to let people know why we are even asking for this permission

26
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:07,460
in order to do that.

27
00:02:07,460 --> 00:02:15,680
I'm going to had to you for police and search for privacy location when in use description.

28
00:02:15,950 --> 00:02:21,590
So you have to come up with a good description over here for right now I'm just going to say to see

29
00:02:21,590 --> 00:02:22,760
your location.

30
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:27,420
OK but in your own apps you have to be more explicit.

31
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:36,800
And after that we have to call another function to actually specify what will happen once we update

32
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,210
the location.

33
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:45,050
So this will start the updating location process and we are going to call this did update location function

34
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:52,310
this one in order to specify what will happen once the location gets updated.

35
00:02:52,310 --> 00:02:58,270
So I'm gonna create a location and this will be SC a location coordinate to the.

36
00:02:58,340 --> 00:03:05,930
So this will ask us to give a latitude and longitude so latitude will and longitude will come from these

37
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:16,580
locations array and I'm going to say this locations locations zero to get the first location out of

38
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:24,880
that location and not let to do the actual location zero that coordinates that's latitude.

39
00:03:25,130 --> 00:03:28,280
OK we're going to do the same thing for longitude.

40
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,320
So location zero dot coordinate dots longitude.

41
00:03:33,320 --> 00:03:38,360
So this will give us the current latitude and longitude of the user.

42
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:43,620
And remember we have to create a spend and this will be m k Cardinal spend.

43
00:03:43,670 --> 00:03:47,960
And this will ask us for latitude Delta and longitude Delta.

44
00:03:47,990 --> 00:03:54,490
Remember this defines the width and height of the current map so that we actually defined the zoom level.

45
00:03:54,770 --> 00:03:58,130
And I'm going to go for all point 0 5.

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:06,190
Later on we can adjust it if we want and we have to create a region which is and I'm okay cause in that

47
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:14,050
region this will ask us for a center and the span and the center will be our location.

48
00:04:14,320 --> 00:04:14,640
OK.

49
00:04:14,660 --> 00:04:19,960
Not locations but the location and spend will be the spend.

50
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:27,590
And finally we can just call the map view to say map view that set region and the region that we want

51
00:04:27,590 --> 00:04:30,790
to focus on the region that we created.

52
00:04:30,790 --> 00:04:31,860
Animation.

53
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:34,040
Of course true.

54
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:41,980
So let me try this in our simulator and let's see if we can get the current location of the user.

55
00:04:42,040 --> 00:04:42,470
OK.

56
00:04:42,470 --> 00:04:43,160
Here you go.

57
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:51,470
Now we see the table we we see this and I'm going to click next I cannot click ness next because it

58
00:04:51,470 --> 00:04:54,890
will give me an error so I'm going to give some dummy values.

59
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:56,220
And here you go.

60
00:04:56,300 --> 00:05:01,250
It asks us to give the location permission.

61
00:05:01,340 --> 00:05:04,230
And once I do that it just zooms in.

62
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:12,830
Remember in the debug section we can give a custom location and in the last section I have given Paris

63
00:05:12,860 --> 00:05:14,940
as custom location.

64
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,360
So let me find another location to have a variety.

65
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:26,500
So we have been working in Paris for some time and I'm going to go for Amsterdam this time.

66
00:05:26,540 --> 00:05:34,430
So let me choose Amsterdam floor from Google Maps to see the latitude and longitude of Amsterdam.

67
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,950
So this is I believe yep this one the latitude and longitude.

68
00:05:39,950 --> 00:05:42,400
So I'm going to copy both of these values.

69
00:05:42,500 --> 00:05:45,080
I'm going to change my custom location.

70
00:05:45,080 --> 00:05:46,750
Of course you don't have to do that.

71
00:05:46,760 --> 00:05:53,520
I'm just doing it so that you won't come across with same examples over time.

72
00:05:53,540 --> 00:05:56,150
So let me change those values.

73
00:05:56,150 --> 00:05:58,730
It has to be common up dots.

74
00:05:58,810 --> 00:05:59,490
OK.

75
00:05:59,570 --> 00:06:04,740
In this a simulator and this has to be common as well.

76
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:07,520
Once I do that the location got changed.

77
00:06:07,640 --> 00:06:09,890
And here we are in the Amsterdam.

78
00:06:10,010 --> 00:06:17,900
I'm going to make this a little bit zoomed in so I'm going to say oh point all three five and I'm going

79
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:19,060
to try that.

80
00:06:19,860 --> 00:06:24,820
So I believe it's will be much better because we will be choosing cafes restaurants.

81
00:06:24,830 --> 00:06:27,700
We have to be as close as possible.

82
00:06:27,710 --> 00:06:28,130
Right.

83
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:30,060
So let me try this.

84
00:06:30,170 --> 00:06:37,010
And here you go we're in the Amsterdam we're more zoomed in and I believe this is better.

85
00:06:37,010 --> 00:06:40,370
So the point is one user opens this map.

86
00:06:40,370 --> 00:06:47,900
They will see their current location but they may want to wander around like this in the maps and if

87
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:55,160
they change their location if they're walking or something they did update locations may camp may get

88
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:03,470
cold again and they will actually be relocated so resumed in the current location.

89
00:07:03,530 --> 00:07:09,890
So if you come across in a situation like that you can just call a location manager that stopped updating

90
00:07:09,890 --> 00:07:11,850
location in here.

91
00:07:11,870 --> 00:07:20,060
Under deal update locations so that you would get the current location but you will stop updating locations

92
00:07:20,780 --> 00:07:27,030
in this did update locations functions so that they can actually wander around the map freely.

93
00:07:27,380 --> 00:07:32,560
And of course you're going to have to try this on your own in your own phone.

94
00:07:32,570 --> 00:07:39,440
I suggest you try that with a real iPhone rather than simulator to see how your app behaves.

95
00:07:39,620 --> 00:07:42,390
And it's fairly easy to do.

96
00:07:42,410 --> 00:07:50,960
You just have to put your USP in in an iPhone and just try that on your own phone.

97
00:07:51,160 --> 00:07:51,840
OK.

98
00:07:51,980 --> 00:07:59,030
And you don't have to do that immediately you just try that when you want to publish an app on the App

99
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:06,550
Store so that you will actually try that on a real device so I'm going to comment this out right now

100
00:08:06,580 --> 00:08:09,300
because I don't seem to be having that problem.

101
00:08:09,730 --> 00:08:12,240
But just keep that in mind.

102
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:13,840
So let's stop here.

103
00:08:13,860 --> 00:08:18,450
I'm within the next lecture we're going to see how to select a location from this map.
