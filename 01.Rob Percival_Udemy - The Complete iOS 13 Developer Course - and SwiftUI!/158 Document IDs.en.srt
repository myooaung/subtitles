00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:09,480
Hi within this lecture regrowing to take care of our problems by figuring out how to start this pulse

2
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,110
by date and starting to implement like function as VO in order to do that.

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:25,860
We are going to use a native method of Firebase so when we get this information from the five star database

4
00:00:25,890 --> 00:00:28,670
we just add the snapshot listener.

5
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:34,800
So if you hit enter or we're here before we add the snapshot listener we gonna add in other methods

6
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,600
called that order.

7
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:37,000
OK.

8
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,330
This will enable us to order data in any way we want.

9
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,760
So if you say that order you will see that it will ask you for a field path or a string.

10
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:55,830
So if you give a date here OK you can specify whether it's going to be a descending or ascending.

11
00:00:56,130 --> 00:00:56,830
OK.

12
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,040
So we want this one at descending boolean by field path.

13
00:01:02,130 --> 00:01:08,730
OK so I'm going to say data here and for descending it's going to be true for me.

14
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:16,800
So it's going to take the data and it's going to order all of these posts by descending structure so

15
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,940
that I will see every passed by descending order regarding to day or dates.

16
00:01:23,940 --> 00:01:31,060
So let's test this and let's see if we can get the last supper in the first position when we run this.

17
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:31,400
OK.

18
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:36,060
You remember this is the last post that we have posted and here you go.

19
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:41,520
Now we see all of this posts in order by day or date.

20
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,230
So let me try this.

21
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:44,780
Let me add another one.

22
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:45,220
OK.

23
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:50,920
Let me choose starry nights this time and for comments I'm going to say.

24
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,100
Let's say one go or test.

25
00:01:53,100 --> 00:02:01,230
I don't know let's say one go ok and hit the upload button it will upload this and download then in

26
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:06,420
the feed and as you can see we see the one go in the first position.

27
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:11,160
So our Instagram clone actually works at this point.

28
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,240
So these dots are their works.

29
00:02:14,250 --> 00:02:16,980
So this is how you order your queries.

30
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:23,630
This is how you order when you try to retrieve information from the database.

31
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:30,610
And we re going to have to filter the results as well.

32
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,560
And in order to do that we are going to implement like function.

33
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:34,940
OK.

34
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:39,260
In order to learn that actually in the like button clicked.

35
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:46,730
Now we're just going to print like button clicked and you will see whenever we tap one of the like bundles

36
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:51,240
it will print out this statement in the logs.

37
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:51,540
OK.

38
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:55,250
So we're we will be certain that this works.

39
00:02:55,380 --> 00:03:02,890
So you can just click one of the like buttons here as you can see in the logs like button click appears.

40
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:10,680
So let's try this one as well as you can see wherever retype wherever we hit on the like button it just

41
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:13,740
prints out in the logs.

42
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:16,990
So what do we want to do in the light by them.

43
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:21,270
When we tap on that we want to increase this likes.

44
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:21,830
Okay.

45
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:26,120
By one and then upload the net value to the server.

46
00:03:26,190 --> 00:03:33,540
So we're going to see how we can filter our results just by the roulette related posts.

47
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:33,930
OK.

48
00:03:33,930 --> 00:03:41,700
So if I click on this post I just want to take this like value from here or I just want to upload to

49
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:44,280
it is like well not the other post.

50
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,100
OK.

51
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:54,630
And it's also I want to not touch the other values from here I just want to update the likes.

52
00:03:54,630 --> 00:03:57,440
So we're going to see how to do that.

53
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:06,060
And this is important information because if you don't know what you're doing you may end up by uploading

54
00:04:06,060 --> 00:04:14,540
likes a value to the all of the posts or you can delete everything in a post by mistake.

55
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:22,260
So we're going to see how to do that properly working with some other methods of firebase.

56
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
So let's see how we can do it.

57
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:26,040
Let's go into the light by them.

58
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:27,130
OK.

59
00:04:27,150 --> 00:04:34,410
And in here we're getting all of this information and we're getting the like array and we're getting

60
00:04:34,410 --> 00:04:42,450
this document I.D. as well but we're not using this document I.D. We didn't save this document I.D.

61
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:44,600
into any area yet.

62
00:04:44,820 --> 00:04:52,350
So let's do that because we will need that document I.D. in order to differentiate posts from each other.

63
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,510
We have to know how to get the current passed.

64
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:01,630
So I'm going to use a technique in order to do that.

65
00:05:01,640 --> 00:05:09,920
I'm going to add another label here and assign my document I.D. area to that label so that I can reach

66
00:05:10,190 --> 00:05:14,600
that value inside of my feed cell as well.

67
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:22,820
Because that's where I want to write my like function inside of my feed so OK you will see what I mean.

68
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:24,620
Let me just write this.

69
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:29,790
So this is going to be a document idea array and this is going to be a string array.

70
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,630
And in here I'm going to remove all the values to prevent duplicating.

71
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,760
OK.

72
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:44,420
And in here in the for loop I'm going to appoint this document I.D. to my document ideally.

73
00:05:44,510 --> 00:05:45,640
So far so good.

74
00:05:45,650 --> 00:05:47,520
You know how to do this.

75
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:50,940
But now let me add this.

76
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:55,650
Now I have to reach this document I.D. from the feed cell.

77
00:05:55,790 --> 00:05:57,450
So that's the trick.

78
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:02,120
So it gives me an error because I misspelled it.

79
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:02,470
Yes.

80
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:05,070
This one I want this one.

81
00:06:05,330 --> 00:06:12,950
So inside of freed cell how can I reach the related document I.D. I don't have an index path in my feed

82
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:13,640
cell.

83
00:06:13,700 --> 00:06:19,450
So how can I know which a user tapped on which picture.

84
00:06:19,660 --> 00:06:19,960
OK.

85
00:06:19,970 --> 00:06:21,550
Which passed.

86
00:06:21,620 --> 00:06:25,060
So I'm going to add a hidden label in here.

87
00:06:25,070 --> 00:06:33,350
OK so that I can reach from the feed cell user won't be able to see that label but we know the document

88
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:35,010
I.D. label is there.

89
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:39,150
So I can get the current value from the document I.D..

90
00:06:39,500 --> 00:06:45,100
This is a technique that you can use of course you can come up with another solution as well.

91
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:48,270
But I believe this is the easiest one.

92
00:06:48,290 --> 00:06:50,270
So let me show you how it goes.

93
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:53,510
So you had to bring in a label.

94
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:57,360
You can put it wherever you want because it's going to be hidden.

95
00:06:57,410 --> 00:07:06,230
If you go to properties here DIY property inspector OK you can check this hidden box and it will be

96
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:07,960
hidden from the user.

97
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:10,970
So let me add the missing constraints as well.

98
00:07:11,330 --> 00:07:19,580
And in fact it doesn't matter if I add the constraints or not but it's good to add this because we will

99
00:07:19,580 --> 00:07:22,550
be getting errors if we don't do it.

100
00:07:22,550 --> 00:07:26,340
So let me bring in this label to my feet so.

101
00:07:26,330 --> 00:07:35,420
So let's say that this is document I.D. label OK document I.D. label so let's connect this.

102
00:07:35,420 --> 00:07:37,550
So now I have this label.

103
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:45,080
Let's go back to our feed we have controller not feed your controller feed Sal actually in here rather

104
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:55,760
than printing out now I'm going to increase the like label by 1 and create a post create a like post

105
00:07:56,060 --> 00:08:04,610
like a firebase post ok for your store pulse and upload the current value to the five your base of course

106
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:13,440
in the South for a row at index parts we have to say Soledad document I.D. label zip code to document

107
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:15,010
array in order to do that.

108
00:08:15,020 --> 00:08:18,620
I'm going to do a comment B to synchronize everything.

109
00:08:18,620 --> 00:08:24,920
So when I say Sal dot it will see the documents I.D. label as well.

110
00:08:24,920 --> 00:08:33,680
So this one Yep document I.D. label dot text is actually document I.D. array index path Doctorow.

111
00:08:33,740 --> 00:08:41,390
So all the values will be assigned to this label and we will see the texts in here.

112
00:08:41,390 --> 00:08:48,020
Actually we're not going to see them because it's hidden user will not be able to see those but we will

113
00:08:48,020 --> 00:08:54,300
be able to get those information using that label inside of our feet so.

114
00:08:54,590 --> 00:09:01,100
So let's stop here and within the next picture we're going to continue implementing our like feature.
