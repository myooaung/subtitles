00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:06.150
Within this section we're going to learn about push notifications and you know where to do that.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.980
We're going to leverage the Instagram clone that we have previously made.

3
00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:16.950
So if you haven't watched the last section I really suggest you go back and watch it so that you can

4
00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:19.820
comprehend what's going on in this section.

5
00:00:19.920 --> 00:00:22.460
Better if you haven't watch.

6
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:28.560
So it really doesn't matter you can still understand what's going on but it will be much more complete

7
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.540
if you watch it.

8
00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:36.880
And I have to warn you this will be pretty boring within this two lectures.

9
00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:39.900
Because we will not be coding.

10
00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:45.090
We will be doing some procedural stuff to enable push notifications.

11
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.830
But if you want to have push notifications you have to learn how it's done.

12
00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:58.200
So if you have to integrate push notifications in your apps and if you're ready to wash this section

13
00:00:58.410 --> 00:01:00.180
now let's get started.
