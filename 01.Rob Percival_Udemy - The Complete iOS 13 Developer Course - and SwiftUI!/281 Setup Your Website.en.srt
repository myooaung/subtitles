00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,080
Hi.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:08,240
We didn't this section regrouping to focus on how to build a website in order to market our app.

3
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:15,810
Right now you know how to create mobile apps in the U.S. and you know how to upload them to the App

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:16,860
Store as well.

5
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:24,240
But it doesn't end there unfortunately you got to market your app so that you can have in stone once

6
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:26,910
you have enrolled using your app.

7
00:00:26,910 --> 00:00:27,270
Right.

8
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:35,340
And we are going to see how we can build this website with the Web hosting package that comes free with

9
00:00:35,340 --> 00:00:36,270
this cars.

10
00:00:36,810 --> 00:00:45,060
And we are going to see how we can use vert press in order to customize this page so that we can change

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,540
whatever we want whenever we want.

12
00:00:48,540 --> 00:00:56,070
And also remember we had to have a privacy document to show to the user in argued to upload our app

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,460
to the App Store as well.

14
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,740
So we're going to learn how to do that in this section as well.

15
00:01:03,330 --> 00:01:07,530
And in the Eco Web hosting that code at the UK.

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:14,010
Now you should have a free count if you haven't watched the second lecture of discourse in which you

17
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,020
learn how to get free stuff.

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:22,800
I suggest you go back and watch it and sign up in the Eco Web posting that the UK so that you can have

19
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,560
your free back posting.

20
00:01:24,660 --> 00:01:31,620
Of course you don't have to use eco Web hosting but since you have a free vote posting for one year

21
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:32,550
why not.

22
00:01:32,550 --> 00:01:39,450
We use it as you can see we have a lot more features in eco Ecolab posting but right now we're interested

23
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,300
in creating and hosting package.

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:42,870
OK.

25
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,210
So click on this hosting package and you you get that come up with a domain name.

26
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,330
For example I'm going to go for cat years 2016.

27
00:01:53,380 --> 00:01:59,210
Let's suppose that I'm building an app showing the cat years OK the age of the cats.

28
00:01:59,310 --> 00:02:07,950
So I'm going to name this cat years 2016 dot com and fact the domain name and housing are completely

29
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:09,220
different things.

30
00:02:09,240 --> 00:02:10,220
So domain name.

31
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,720
Is this the name of your Web site and hosting is value save your Web site.

32
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:22,750
For example we're going to go forward this advanced unlimited linux server to save our Web site.

33
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:30,150
So after you choose this just click on this create hosting package and this may take a few moments to

34
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:36,330
create your server and create everything that you're going to need in order to have your Web site.

35
00:02:36,330 --> 00:02:37,470
OK.

36
00:02:37,600 --> 00:02:42,090
Now after that you will be presented in a page like this.

37
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:45,480
And it will be e-mailed to you how to log in.

38
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:48,120
But let me show you how to log in easily.

39
00:02:48,120 --> 00:02:53,910
All you have to do is just go to this Web site code that UK CB list domains.

40
00:02:53,910 --> 00:03:00,450
This will list the domains that you have created hosting for and as you can see I have a lot of domains

41
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:05,760
over here but you will just on the sea once and that is the one that I'm looking for.

42
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:06,370
OK.

43
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:14,340
So after you click on this domain it will take you to the set up page and in the setup page you're going

44
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,250
to be presented with a lot of options.

45
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:24,540
That's going to look for wordpress because remember we're going to use WordPress to create our Web site

46
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,520
and you're going to see what WordPress is.

47
00:03:26,520 --> 00:03:27,780
Don't worry.

48
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:28,560
So here you go.

49
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:35,690
We now see these options like files e-mail and Web states sigs and logs and everything.

50
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,220
But we're looking for work press tools.

51
00:03:38,250 --> 00:03:44,060
So scroll down until you see wordpress blog after you see it just click on it.

52
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:47,240
It will take you to this Web site.

53
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:54,320
And in fact we're going to do only one thing over here we're just going to activate the word press install

54
00:03:54,330 --> 00:04:00,030
it on our servers so that we can set it up and start using it immediately.

55
00:04:00,030 --> 00:04:09,780
But in fact you have to wait like maybe an half an hour or end up to an hour in order to activate this

56
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:18,500
because this will require scripting to be effective scripting to be active on your hosting.

57
00:04:18,520 --> 00:04:22,830
It generally takes something like an hour to be active.

58
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:23,300
OK.

59
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:31,590
So after you are sure that you waited for an hour or an half an hour you can just click on install.

60
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:35,360
If you get an error just you have to wait a little bit more.

61
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:38,020
But if you don't then you're OK.

62
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:45,520
So here you have to choose your domain name and domain name is actually something that you should buy.

63
00:04:45,750 --> 00:04:46,530
OK.

64
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:50,500
This is a service provided by eco Web hosting as well.

65
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:57,570
But you can just get your domain name from other services as well and use the free hosting that comes

66
00:04:57,570 --> 00:05:04,430
with Ecolab posting if you want to buy a domain name you can't just go to Ecolab posting that calling

67
00:05:04,430 --> 00:05:07,770
out the UK C.P. and sign up.

68
00:05:08,170 --> 00:05:13,510
And again you don't have to do this at this point if you don't want a domain name you can just go for

69
00:05:13,510 --> 00:05:16,410
it is say 1 9 1 7 0.

70
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,840
Think and this is completely free.

71
00:05:18,850 --> 00:05:22,310
This is the IP address of our hosting.

72
00:05:22,310 --> 00:05:30,360
OK but if you want to have a domain connected to your IP address then you're going to have to buy it.

73
00:05:30,370 --> 00:05:33,380
So here I'm just going to install the WordPress buzz.

74
00:05:33,490 --> 00:05:39,490
But as you can see it tries to go to these domain names which we don't have at this moment because we

75
00:05:39,490 --> 00:05:40,600
didn't buy it.

76
00:05:40,630 --> 00:05:44,430
So I'm just going to cope with this I'm pasted over here.

77
00:05:44,470 --> 00:05:45,210
OK.

78
00:05:45,400 --> 00:05:50,100
With slash index that BHP in order to make this work.

79
00:05:50,110 --> 00:05:57,310
Once I do that it will take me to the set up page initialization page of the WordPress.

80
00:05:57,340 --> 00:05:58,450
So here you go.

81
00:05:58,450 --> 00:06:06,040
I'm going to choose a site title which is can't years and I'm gonna go for a user name admin and it's

82
00:06:06,040 --> 00:06:13,390
actually not a good idea to go with admin user names so just write your own name over here and use a

83
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:15,160
strong password.

84
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:21,400
And I'm just going to go for the default one and after you give your email you can just hit those safe

85
00:06:21,530 --> 00:06:25,570
Wordpress and let me say this to lust past.

86
00:06:25,570 --> 00:06:30,120
This is just the software that I use in order to save passwords.

87
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:36,850
You don't have to do that and I'm just going to say log in and it will take me to the log in page.

88
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:38,440
So we're here.

89
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:43,980
I'm just going to say admin and I'm just going to use the password that I have created.

90
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,100
OK.

91
00:06:45,250 --> 00:06:50,330
So after you do that you can just say you remember me and tried to log in.

92
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:57,390
So once you do that it will take you to the dashboard of the work press.

93
00:06:57,580 --> 00:07:04,840
So in order to reach the dashboard you can use this slash WP dash admin think and if you see something

94
00:07:04,840 --> 00:07:11,920
like this saying please update now you can just click on this please update now in order to update your

95
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:19,450
WordPress I really suggest you do that before you dive into anything because of WordPress is so commonly

96
00:07:19,450 --> 00:07:22,210
used and hackers know that.

97
00:07:22,210 --> 00:07:28,930
So they try to hack the websites they are using Wordpress and work presses constantly releasing security

98
00:07:28,930 --> 00:07:29,920
updates.

99
00:07:29,920 --> 00:07:34,080
And if you update your work press it won't be a matter for you.

100
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,170
It won't be a problem.

101
00:07:35,170 --> 00:07:37,710
But don't forget to update it.

102
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,420
So once you do that you can just go over to these dashboard one more time in which you will see some

103
00:07:43,480 --> 00:07:44,570
options.

104
00:07:44,620 --> 00:07:47,790
So WordPress started as a blogging template.

105
00:07:47,830 --> 00:07:48,370
OK.

106
00:07:48,460 --> 00:07:54,910
So you will see a lot of write your first blog create your first post and everything but in fact we

107
00:07:54,910 --> 00:08:00,480
can use this word press in order to create Web sites as well.

108
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:07,540
For example if you click on visit your Web site you will see our Web site is currently something like

109
00:08:07,540 --> 00:08:14,260
an empty block but we are going to take care of that and make it look of some like this using this free

110
00:08:14,500 --> 00:08:18,220
team that we can gather in WordPress as well.

111
00:08:18,220 --> 00:08:24,190
Now let's stop here and within the next lecture we're going to use this Apps team in order to make a

112
00:08:24,190 --> 00:08:25,420
stunning Web site.
