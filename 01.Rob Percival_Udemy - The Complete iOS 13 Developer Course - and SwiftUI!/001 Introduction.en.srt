Hi.

2
00:00:01,170 --> 00:00:04,300
Welcome to the complete US developer course.

3
00:00:04,420 --> 00:00:11,770
I'm a tool and I teach more than 150000 students so new to me on mobile programming and cybersecurity

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,280
courses along with co-stars by Rob Percival.

5
00:00:16,310 --> 00:00:20,830
These are more than 1 million students on line with this experience.

6
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:28,170
We bring you one of the most comprehensive and one of the most up to date us courses ever created.

7
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:35,010
So first let me start by saying that you don't have to have any prior knowledge in order to take this

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:38,020
course because you're going to start from scratch.

9
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,100
And then you finish the scores.

10
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,020
You will be advanced in swift and US development where you're you going to teach you Terry.

11
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:51,290
But we're going to do it in a practical and interactive way.

12
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:57,720
We are going to build an Instagram clone at Foursquare as long as Snapchat clone and an Angry Birds

13
00:00:57,720 --> 00:01:00,810
clone along with so many other apps.

14
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,530
So we're going to work in the real life examples.

15
00:01:04,530 --> 00:01:08,780
You will learn how risk development by doing it yourself.

16
00:01:08,790 --> 00:01:10,710
This course has it all.

17
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:17,100
Not only you will be able to build your own apps but also you will learn how to make money out of your

18
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:17,610
apps.

19
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:21,130
How to put them to the App Store and how to design your own.

20
00:01:21,140 --> 00:01:28,350
Perhaps we are even going to provide you a one year loan that cost to you so that you can create an

21
00:01:28,350 --> 00:01:34,860
marketing website for your apps on the top of that you're going to have a three hundred dollars worth

22
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,090
of visuals and images to use in your own apps.

23
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:46,890
Finally you will be able to participate the examinations of Cambridge sort of authority for swift level

24
00:01:46,890 --> 00:01:48,630
1 and swift Level 2.

25
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:50,670
So that's it.

26
00:01:50,910 --> 00:01:57,810
So if you want to be a professional US developer or if you want to build the app of your dreams then

27
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:00,150
it's time to enroll to the course.

28
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:06,840
If you have any questions during the course you can reach me in the Q and A sections all your questions

29
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:09,980
will be answered within 24 hours.

30
00:02:10,020 --> 00:02:12,510
Now if you're ready let's get started.
