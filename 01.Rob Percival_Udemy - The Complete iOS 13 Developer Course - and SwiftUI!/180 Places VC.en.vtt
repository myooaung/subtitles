Hi.

2
00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.680
We didn't this lecture re going to add our Neal we controllers so that we can really see the effects

3
00:00:07.680 --> 00:00:10.440
of signing in and signing up the users.

4
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.730
And so that we can move on to create our Foursquare clone.

5
00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:20.980
So let's go to our main story Bart because we need the wheel controller.

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:25.490
So let's open our library and search for a real controller.

7
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:26.270
OK.

8
00:00:26.490 --> 00:00:29.430
We're going to bring in one were you controller.

9
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:36.570
Every going to use this we have controller as at places we have controller in which we display the places

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.350
that has been saved to the server in the table view.

11
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:48.010
So this is going to be a very basic weave controller in which we will only have one table view after

12
00:00:48.010 --> 00:00:48.300
this.

13
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:55.500
We have controller we're going to have multiple more view controllers as well because we need some other

14
00:00:55.500 --> 00:01:02.100
wi controllers to choose the image choose the location choose the type and the name of the places that

15
00:01:02.100 --> 00:01:10.350
we are going to save every going to say great from here to other view controllers later on.

16
00:01:10.380 --> 00:01:18.330
So first thing that comes to my mind is to have a navigation controller over here so that we can navigate

17
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:21.690
between this and the other we have controllers.

18
00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:22.810
OK.

19
00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:32.550
So choose this we have controller over here and go to your menu to Ed and come into this embed and then

20
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:35.010
say navigation controller.

21
00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:36.730
So you have seen this before.

22
00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:39.540
This brings in and navigation bar.

23
00:01:39.660 --> 00:01:47.400
And when we do a Segway from here to another view controllers they have automatic back buttons in the

24
00:01:47.400 --> 00:01:49.010
left hand side.

25
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.310
So let's do the Segway from here to navigation controller.

26
00:01:53.310 --> 00:02:00.090
And once we do that as you can see it's kinds of these starts here because it does the Segway as a pop

27
00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:03.870
over Segway and we don't need that that's right.

28
00:02:03.960 --> 00:02:09.330
And we don't need any navigation controller in the sign in.

29
00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:11.340
We have controller as well.

30
00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:18.410
So we're going to have to change the type of the Segway in order to overcome this problem.

31
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:26.100
So click or we're here and rather than push I'm going to present Model T and to remember if we change

32
00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:31.830
this presentation to full screen then we're going to solve this problem.

33
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:33.220
So here you go.

34
00:02:33.240 --> 00:02:42.480
Now I am ready to come over here to this Segway and give some identifier so I'm going to call these

35
00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:49.750
two places we see because I'm going to name my new controller as places where you controller.

36
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.780
OK.

37
00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:52.530
And here you go.

38
00:02:52.530 --> 00:02:55.770
Let's bring in some we we're using here.

39
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:01.420
So open the library and search for table view and that's all we're going to need in this.

40
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:03.470
We have controller anyway.

41
00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:10.650
So let me give some constraints and we're going to do 0 0 0 because we want to stretch out this table

42
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:14.810
all the way to the edges so that it will fill up all the screen.

43
00:03:16.110 --> 00:03:17.350
So that's good.

44
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:25.200
Let's come over here and create a new file so that we can have our cocoa touch class and bind it to

45
00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:27.150
our new controller.

46
00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:29.820
So this is not going to be a table we'll sell.

47
00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:33.050
This is going to be something UI we you.

48
00:03:33.050 --> 00:03:34.960
Yep UI we have a controller.

49
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:43.590
And here I'm going to call this places we see and hear next to places under my Foursquare clone project

50
00:03:43.590 --> 00:03:44.810
folder.

51
00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.410
So here you go.

52
00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:54.000
If you come over here to means sorry Bert you can connect your weave controller from identity inspector

53
00:03:54.270 --> 00:04:02.730
to your places we Coco touch class so that we can define all the views using our assistant editor.

54
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:09.110
And let me bring in my table view from here and call this table view.

55
00:04:09.990 --> 00:04:10.550
Yep.

56
00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:15.320
Now we're ready actually because that's all we need.

57
00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:23.190
And in the places we have controller I want to have a navigation Biden as well because I need a button

58
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:31.760
to add to new places as you have seen in the initial lecture of the section where I have introduced

59
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:32.850
the Foursquare clone.

60
00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:34.350
That's where you're going to build.

61
00:04:34.350 --> 00:04:43.380
Remember we had the one button on the right hand side just a plus button allowing us to add a new place.

62
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.110
So remember how we do that.

63
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:51.760
We can't call the navigation controller Dot's navigation bar Dot's top item.

64
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:55.530
And this gives us the type of item of the navigation bar.

65
00:04:55.830 --> 00:04:56.860
If you say right.

66
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.410
Bar button item.

67
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:01.710
That's all we need to add a new bottom.

68
00:05:01.710 --> 00:05:07.530
So we want a button and we want it on the right hand side of the top navigation bar.

69
00:05:08.130 --> 00:05:15.450
So this is going to be a UI bar button item and I'm going to go for this system item and Target and

70
00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.310
action as usual.

71
00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.120
So let me close this down and for system item.

72
00:05:21.120 --> 00:05:23.480
I'm going to go for at again.

73
00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:27.630
And Target will be self of course and selector.

74
00:05:27.630 --> 00:05:28.680
We don't have it.

75
00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:34.460
So let me just say so like her and we're going to have to create that selector function.

76
00:05:34.500 --> 00:05:40.970
So this is going to be an object to see function add new place or add button clicked.

77
00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:41.930
OK.

78
00:05:42.930 --> 00:05:50.610
So now I can come over here and say Add button clicked and this will be displayed in my navigation bar.

79
00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:52.160
So this is where I will.

80
00:05:52.170 --> 00:05:57.030
USA way to my ads places where you controller.

81
00:05:57.210 --> 00:06:04.290
So let me run this actually do we have to do anything else to test this.

82
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:08.490
No I don't think so because we have our Segway right.

83
00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:08.980
Yep.

84
00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:14.120
We we have to actually because in sign in and sign up clicked.

85
00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:14.430
Yep.

86
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:16.470
You're not doing it and say Gray right now.

87
00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:19.220
So I'm going to say perform Segway.

88
00:06:19.980 --> 00:06:22.200
So perform Segway.

89
00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:25.400
And the identifier will be two places we see.

90
00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:27.900
And the sender will be nil.

91
00:06:28.350 --> 00:06:36.420
And we have to copy and paste this to sign up clicked as well so that we can take people to the places

92
00:06:36.420 --> 00:06:39.930
we have controller when they sign up.

93
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:46.320
So we get some kind of error Yeah we have to say self-taught perform Segway and we have to say soft

94
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:48.680
power from Segway from here.

95
00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:56.670
So let me run this and test to see if we can take the users in by signing them in or signing them up

96
00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.440
and let's see if we can't see the ad button as well.

97
00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:01.990
So let's go for James.

98
00:07:01.980 --> 00:07:03.960
One two three four five six.

99
00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:04.580
Here you go.

100
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:09.190
When I click sign in now I'm in the places where you controller.

101
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.140
That's nice.

102
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.590
Now I have my ADD button as well.

103
00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:17.760
Once I click it and nothing happens because I haven't read to my function yet.

104
00:07:17.760 --> 00:07:22.340
And one problem that we have right now wi fi open this from scratch.

105
00:07:22.410 --> 00:07:26.070
It will ask me for a user name and password one more time.

106
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:30.170
And this is not good because nobody will use my app.

107
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:34.230
If I ask user name and password every time they open the app.

108
00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:40.260
So I have to find a function to remember if the user is logged in or not.

109
00:07:40.260 --> 00:07:45.290
So if the user is logged in I'm going to take them to the places we see if they are not.

110
00:07:45.390 --> 00:07:49.010
I'm going to take them to this signing receipt.

111
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:51.570
So that's what we're going to do in the next lecture.
