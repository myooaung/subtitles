00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:08.850
Hi within this lecture re going to finalize our solar system app with finding some planet textures in

2
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.660
order to do that.

3
00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:18.480
I'm going to go read is open game that are one more time and I will see if we can find some verbs textures

4
00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:26.880
like mask textures or Venus textures to show in our app so we can just start by searching over this

5
00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.440
website.

6
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.440
If that doesn't work of course we can move to other Web sites as well.

7
00:00:31.440 --> 00:00:39.570
So I'm going to go into browse textures and under textures I'm just going to search for world or planet

8
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:44.650
or galaxy so that we can see the options that we can gather here.

9
00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.760
So we have some kind of options but I believe they are not good.

10
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:58.770
So very looking something like this like a world map but in a flat way so that we can wrap this around

11
00:00:58.770 --> 00:01:01.860
our sphere and it would look good.

12
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:05.160
But I believe this is not the one that we are looking for.

13
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.220
So let me go to Google and I'm just going to search for Planet textures.

14
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.870
OK so if you do that you will see a lot of options over here as well.

15
00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:20.070
And there is a website called textures for planets.

16
00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.510
So it's simple.

17
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.830
Planet textures OK textures for planets.

18
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:32.100
So if you come over here to downloads I believe we have the option of downloading a software which is

19
00:01:32.100 --> 00:01:36.950
not we want but we can go for this texture packs.

20
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:43.950
And over here you will see some packs like habitable work pack or inhospitable work pack for example

21
00:01:43.960 --> 00:01:45.870
inhospitable per rogue pack.

22
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:53.850
I believe we have Martians so I'm going to download this and over here there is a terrorist serial world

23
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:54.910
with clouds.

24
00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:01.830
So let me download this as well and we will see what we get in those textures.

25
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:03.300
So this is one of them.

26
00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.270
So let me bring those in.

27
00:02:05.310 --> 00:02:11.220
If you cannot find them online you can just use mine over my github account.

28
00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:19.140
OK so let's see the marks and yep I believe we can work with this PMG as you can see this represents

29
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.080
the Mars and Venus.

30
00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.790
So yeah we can use that.

31
00:02:23.790 --> 00:02:28.470
So let me name this Venus and let me name this Mars.

32
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:32.000
And let me delete this because we don't need it.

33
00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.210
And let me come over here.

34
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.530
So it kind of looks like earth.

35
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:40.910
I don't know what it is actually but we can use it right.

36
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:42.900
Because it's looking good.

37
00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:46.790
Yeah I believe this is roadmap so we can go along with this.

38
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:54.240
And if it doesn't look good of course we can just find another one and just changed as later on so something

39
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:55.650
to go for this one.

40
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:03.360
So let me bring in this by changing its name to vote and let me bring over here and take everything

41
00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:06.450
in here and I believe we don't need that.

42
00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:16.020
So let me open my art that CNN sets and bring all of this visuals in now rather than creating disappear.

43
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.750
I'm going to create the vote.

44
00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.010
Mars and the Venus.

45
00:03:20.010 --> 00:03:20.650
OK.

46
00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:28.440
So let me comment this out of course in your own time you can search for other planets as well.

47
00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:32.410
So for a world I'm going to give a radius of 0.01.

48
00:03:32.610 --> 00:03:34.990
And I'm going to save our dog PMG.

49
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:40.580
So this will have the SVM vector of let me choose this for x.

50
00:03:40.590 --> 00:03:44.360
I'm going to go for zero for y 0.01.

51
00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:47.240
And for is that minus 1.

52
00:03:47.250 --> 00:03:53.920
So right now I'm just going to create the others but of course I have to change this my sphere to work.

53
00:03:54.510 --> 00:04:01.970
So if you create Mars for radius you can go something like all point 2 or point 3.

54
00:04:01.980 --> 00:04:08.320
But I suggest if you're really building this app for educational purposes for like kids.

55
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:09.240
OK.

56
00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:17.940
You have to see if you can find the real dimensions of world and Mars for example if Mars is twice as

57
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:19.090
big as world.

58
00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.280
You can go for 0.01 0 point 2 in this case.

59
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:31.050
So I'm going to say Mars stopped PSG and for vector I'm going to open this and I'm just going to move

60
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:34.110
this a little bit further away from world.

61
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:42.660
And again you can actually decide to do this relative to day your own sizes own distances in the real

62
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.250
solar system.

63
00:04:44.250 --> 00:04:45.100
OK.

64
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:50.390
So let me add this to our scene and the route.

65
00:04:50.400 --> 00:04:51.070
No Dad.

66
00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:58.020
Ed child node and rather than work I'm going to go for Mars and let me create the Venus.

67
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:06.030
So let's cold this creates fear and I don't know the actual size of wieners or her relative size to

68
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:13.590
the world so I'm going to go for oh point fifteen and call this Venus stop PSG and for vector let me

69
00:05:13.590 --> 00:05:17.060
just move this further away from Mars as well.

70
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:25.380
And again in a real app you will just calculate the distance between Earth and Mars and Mars and Venus

71
00:05:25.410 --> 00:05:28.800
and make this relative to the actual distances.

72
00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:29.790
Okay.

73
00:05:29.910 --> 00:05:40.010
And let me call these same Zs like minus one and we will add this to our scene as we have done before.

74
00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.520
So moment of truth.

75
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:47.790
Let me run this on my iPhone and see how it looks like in our living room.

76
00:05:47.790 --> 00:05:48.630
So here we go.

77
00:05:48.630 --> 00:05:50.220
Now I have the earth.

78
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:57.240
I have the Mars and I have the Venus and as you can see Mars is much bigger than the Earth and Venus

79
00:05:57.240 --> 00:05:59.780
is much bigger than the Earth again.

80
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:02.390
So my Mars is the biggest one.

81
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:05.360
I believe that's the case in real life as well.

82
00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.520
And we can see the top.

83
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.510
We can see the bottom and we can see every aspect of this sphere.

84
00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:18.180
So this is actually very cool and my dog is still sitting over there.

85
00:06:18.210 --> 00:06:19.480
So here you go.

86
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:25.080
Now we managed to create this solar system app with just field lines of code.

87
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:32.670
Thanks to the market you can actually create this as an educational app so that you can just publish

88
00:06:32.670 --> 00:06:35.520
it on the app store or you can educate your own kids.

89
00:06:35.520 --> 00:06:36.480
I don't know.

90
00:06:36.480 --> 00:06:38.650
So I hope you enjoyed this one.

91
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:42.450
Where are you going to stop here and continue within the next section.
