00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:08,040
Hi within this lecture regarding to process this information that we got from PARS so that we can show

2
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:15,220
the place name the place type the place Utmost Fear and accordance to the user in our details we've

3
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,790
controller.

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:19,840
So how do we do that.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,790
Of course I will start to see if objects is not normal or not.

6
00:00:25,050 --> 00:00:29,350
So if objects is not nil I can go and do my thing.

7
00:00:29,790 --> 00:00:34,440
If objects are nil then there is no point of doing that at all.

8
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:40,440
In most of the times we have to go in a forward looping here because we are working with individual

9
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:41,220
objects.

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:46,110
But in this case I expect to see only one object right.

11
00:00:47,220 --> 00:00:54,170
So I can't try to create this object by saying let my objects objects zero.

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:56,960
So this will give me the first objects.

13
00:00:57,060 --> 00:00:59,930
First element of this area.

14
00:00:59,970 --> 00:01:07,890
This will ask me to first cast this and I believe it's kind of safe to do it in here because we have

15
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:15,480
already checked to see if objects is not nil but maybe in order to make the safer we can check to see

16
00:01:15,490 --> 00:01:16,440
if it objects.

17
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:20,160
That count is greater than zero.

18
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,820
So that we know the objects is not nil.

19
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:31,830
And there are some elements inside of our objects array and this asks us to first cast this but it doesn't

20
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,750
make sense to do it like this.

21
00:01:33,750 --> 00:01:40,920
So I can just control like those if objects not count is greater than zero then I believe this is much

22
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:41,950
more safer.

23
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:50,050
OK so that I can create my individual object like this without having to have a for loop because we're

24
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:55,830
going to be dealing with only one object and let's call this chosen place object.

25
00:01:55,850 --> 00:01:56,270
OK.

26
00:01:56,290 --> 00:02:00,740
My object is not a very good choice for a variable name.

27
00:02:00,870 --> 00:02:09,120
So in this chosen place object if we say something like object for ki I can just get whatever I want

28
00:02:09,120 --> 00:02:10,230
out of this.

29
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:10,660
Right.

30
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:16,120
Like if let's place name then I can just say for key name.

31
00:02:16,320 --> 00:02:18,780
Remember we have defined this as name.

32
00:02:18,870 --> 00:02:26,100
I will cast is optionally a string and if that's the case I'm going to change little name label details.

33
00:02:26,100 --> 00:02:28,140
Name labels so details.

34
00:02:28,140 --> 00:02:37,430
Name label DOB taxed is now the chosen place place names are so I'm going to do this for other variables

35
00:02:37,430 --> 00:02:37,850
as well.

36
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:42,400
So let me corporatism pasted so I did this for place name.

37
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:44,220
Let's do that for a place type.

38
00:02:44,600 --> 00:02:53,070
So this will be type again this will be a string and details type label dot tax going to be place type.

39
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:54,950
So far so good.

40
00:02:54,980 --> 00:02:57,350
Let's go for the third one.

41
00:02:57,350 --> 00:03:01,030
So rather than type I'm going to go for atmosphere.

42
00:03:01,340 --> 00:03:08,900
Okay so this will be place atmosphere rather than place type atmosphere.

43
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:17,430
So this will be place utmost fear and this will be details utmost for your labels are tax so that's

44
00:03:17,460 --> 00:03:19,280
all for labels I believe.

45
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:24,080
Now are we going to have to get the results from our yes.

46
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:26,990
It asks us to use s I believe.

47
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:29,370
Inside in front of everything.

48
00:03:29,370 --> 00:03:34,510
So let's first scrap this and let's say self in front of this.

49
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:44,100
Yep because we're in a closure and then later Owen we're going to have to get the image and also the

50
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:52,680
latitude and longitude first go for latitude and longitude if left place latitude chosen place I.D.

51
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:56,840
chosen place object sorry that object.

52
00:03:57,330 --> 00:04:04,290
And four key I'm going to go for latitude and we're going to have to convert this to double later on

53
00:04:04,290 --> 00:04:06,420
because we saved it as a drink.

54
00:04:07,470 --> 00:04:13,890
So let's create some chosen latitude and longitude over here as doubles.

55
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:14,500
Okay.

56
00:04:14,510 --> 00:04:17,670
We gonna need the doubles eventually.

57
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:19,680
So let's say chosen longitude.

58
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,600
This is a double as well.

59
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,830
And we're going to convert this gem convert them in here to be double so I'm going to say if let's place

60
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:36,870
latitude double Okay double parentheses place latitude.

61
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:46,380
So this one if I can make this string into a double then I will say self-taught chosen latitude is place

62
00:04:46,380 --> 00:04:48,060
latitude double.

63
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:53,640
So that's how you actually convert double to string and string to double right.

64
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:58,520
You know this every going to do the same thing for longitude as well.

65
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:05,670
If that place longitude is chosen place object object for key and the key that I'm looking for is the

66
00:05:05,670 --> 00:05:13,950
longitude I'm going to cast is optional as string and say placed longitude double again double with

67
00:05:13,950 --> 00:05:23,790
parentheses place longitude and then later on I'm going to say self that chosen longitude is now chosen

68
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:34,110
longitude is now place longitude double and the last thing that we have to do is just to get the image

69
00:05:34,500 --> 00:05:41,970
and we know how to upload the image but we don't know how to download it yet it's fairly easy to do

70
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:49,380
we just get the data and we download the data and if we can make it then we're going to convert it to

71
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:57,000
an image so let's see how we can do that first of all I'm going to create something called Image Data

72
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:05,180
right because we have saved this as data another UI image and we're going to download this as data again

73
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:09,980
now we're going to use that data to displayed in an image view.

74
00:06:10,830 --> 00:06:19,050
So let's say that if that image data is chosen place objects dots object and the key that I'm looking

75
00:06:19,050 --> 00:06:20,420
for is image.

76
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:21,100
OK.

77
00:06:21,210 --> 00:06:32,100
Remember we saved this column as image and I'm going to cast this as PR file so PR file objects and

78
00:06:32,820 --> 00:06:37,370
I'm going to check to see if we can actually download this.

79
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:44,300
So after you get your variable you have to manually download this to get the data.

80
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:52,170
So you're going to have to say image data dot image data that gets data.

81
00:06:52,470 --> 00:06:53,230
OK.

82
00:06:53,310 --> 00:06:58,380
As you can see if you say get data we have something in background.

83
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,450
So get data in background.

84
00:07:00,450 --> 00:07:08,130
It's either gives us data or an error in this time I'm not going to check if error is not nil and maybe

85
00:07:08,130 --> 00:07:11,710
we can just check if error is nil like this.

86
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:12,630
OK.

87
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:18,000
If error is nil then you can check to see if data is not nil.

88
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,970
One more time but I'm just going to go for data.

89
00:07:23,310 --> 00:07:27,630
Not this one s dots details imagery.

90
00:07:27,670 --> 00:07:27,940
Yep.

91
00:07:27,960 --> 00:07:29,850
This one dot image.

92
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:32,280
So this will be a UI image.

93
00:07:32,370 --> 00:07:33,100
OK.

94
00:07:33,450 --> 00:07:38,700
And this will ask you for a data and the data that I'm looking for is the data itself.

95
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:43,060
So if you do that it will ask you to first cast this.

96
00:07:43,110 --> 00:07:43,830
OK.

97
00:07:43,950 --> 00:07:46,080
You can do that of course.

98
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:55,350
But again you can check to see if data is not nil like this to be extra cautious so that you won't crash

99
00:07:55,350 --> 00:07:57,060
your app.

100
00:07:57,510 --> 00:07:58,830
So far so good.

101
00:07:59,040 --> 00:08:06,780
So rather than just zooming in the map I believe we have done everything right.

102
00:08:06,870 --> 00:08:16,100
So let's cut everything from here because we made that we did load we have filled up so let me create

103
00:08:16,100 --> 00:08:22,940
another function called get data from pass and paste everything under that function and call that function

104
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:25,220
under my we did load.

105
00:08:25,220 --> 00:08:28,530
So I believe now we are ready to test this.

106
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:36,890
We want to get the map animating to this selected location but I believe we can do that in the next

107
00:08:36,890 --> 00:08:37,830
lecture as well.

108
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,390
Let's see if we can get the other details so let's open our simulator.

109
00:08:43,390 --> 00:08:46,370
Now let's choose the only place that we have.

110
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:47,030
Here you go.

111
00:08:47,030 --> 00:08:53,150
We see the image we see the image name the restaurant name the type and everything.

112
00:08:53,210 --> 00:08:57,080
So we don't see the data in my maps yet.

113
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,510
But we are going to see it in a minute in the next lecture.
