00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:09.630
Hi within this lecture we want to make our game so that then we show our birth it will return to its

2
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:17.260
original position and we want to do it in a way that we will check for its velocity.

3
00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:21.030
So when it slows down so when it's about to stop.

4
00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:26.400
We can just take the bird and put it on the original position.

5
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:33.750
For example if I run my simulator one more time my birth will return to its original position.

6
00:00:33.790 --> 00:00:42.090
But I want it to be happening go to manically then the bird slows down and we're going to do that under

7
00:00:42.090 --> 00:00:44.580
this update function.

8
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.690
So this is a function.

9
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.150
This is getting cold each every time.

10
00:00:50.310 --> 00:00:52.350
Each frame is rendered.

11
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.960
So every time we do something in our game the frame is being rendered.

12
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:00.600
So it's happening continuously.

13
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:06.910
So if I check something over here it will be checked continuously during the gate.

14
00:01:07.080 --> 00:01:14.580
So when my when I just trolled my bird up in the air then it rolls around when it hits on something.

15
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:22.470
The frame is getting rendered so I can check to see if my physics body is changing over here and by

16
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:30.090
the way we can just do and if let bird physics by the over here in order to make our physics buddy not

17
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:31.240
optional.

18
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:39.390
Okay so far we haven't needed it but if you need it any time in your app you can just do it to have

19
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:49.830
a non optional physics body and again in here I want to check to see if birds physics body okay Dot

20
00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:52.770
Physics body data velocity.

21
00:01:52.770 --> 00:02:01.920
So we have some sort of velocities over here like our fellow city of x axis velocity of y axis and angular

22
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:03.180
velocity.

23
00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.340
So I'm going to control all of them and I'm going to see if they're actually less than 0.01 for example

24
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.270
this is a very low number.

25
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:19.860
It means that it's about to stop so you can do it like this less than or equal to 0.01.

26
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:31.350
And again Burt physics body data velocity that Devi meaning the y axis the velocity of the y axis is

27
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:32.820
less than 0.01.

28
00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.250
And again Burt physics body that's angular velocity.

29
00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:38.750
Okay.

30
00:02:38.760 --> 00:02:40.200
This one.

31
00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:46.530
So this is the angular speed of the bird is less than 0.01.

32
00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:54.780
If these conditions hold and on the top of that we have to check to see if game is started or not because

33
00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:57.690
games should be started at this point.

34
00:02:57.690 --> 00:02:58.270
Right.

35
00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:05.700
Because by me first open the app the angular relaxed the end the velocity of the other axis are all

36
00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:10.590
already zero but we have to be certain that game is started.

37
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.220
So they are not zero and they are about to be zero.

38
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:17.160
So that we can reset the game.

39
00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:21.110
We can just take the bird to its original position.

40
00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:31.050
So if every condition holds now I can just take my bird to be its own the original position so I can

41
00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:38.940
come over here and rather than using bird physics by the I believe we should use birds that physics

42
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:44.720
by the over here and say I affected by gravity is false.

43
00:03:44.730 --> 00:03:53.610
Not to it's false OK because we we're going to reset this and birds physic body that velocity is zero

44
00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.830
and.

45
00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.080
That physics body and it has to BCG vector not zero.

46
00:04:00.090 --> 00:04:10.610
We have to go like the 0 0 over here again and Bert that physics body that's angular velocity is zero.

47
00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:13.860
And we have to reset the position as well.

48
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:27.450
So Bert that z position is 1 and Bert dots not be for Bert DOT's position is actually the original position

49
00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:38.160
and then later on I can just say game start it is false because this will be the starting point of my

50
00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:43.200
app so D asks me if I want to force unwrap this.

51
00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:51.340
Yep I'm going to do that and ans here I believe we have to have one equals sign only.

52
00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.410
Let's try this.

53
00:04:52.410 --> 00:04:54.060
Let's test this.

54
00:04:54.180 --> 00:05:01.080
So if this works when I throw my bird in the air when it slows down it will reset the bird and put it

55
00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:05.460
eat put it in the original position like this.

56
00:05:05.460 --> 00:05:06.360
So here you go.

57
00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.190
Now it's working.

58
00:05:08.190 --> 00:05:09.930
Now let's try one more time.

59
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:15.060
It's kind of rotated but it doesn't matter when I chose this.

60
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.990
It will come back to its original place when it slows down.

61
00:05:18.990 --> 00:05:23.620
So this is exactly what I wanted in the first place.

62
00:05:23.670 --> 00:05:25.140
So here you go.

63
00:05:25.140 --> 00:05:31.540
Now all we have to do is just to find a way to understand the collisions.

64
00:05:31.590 --> 00:05:40.140
So when I hit on the boxes I want to understand that operations so that I can increase my score.

65
00:05:40.170 --> 00:05:43.470
That's what we're going to do within the next lecture.
