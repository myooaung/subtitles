00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:00.950
Hi.

2
00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:08.510
We didn't this lecture we going to see how to create users have to manage users using far your base.

3
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:12.910
So we're past boring stuff creating user interface and everything now.

4
00:00:12.940 --> 00:00:19.080
We're going to learn the real deal with five your base in order to do that.

5
00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.780
We gonna have to go back to our dashboard and go to authentication module.

6
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:30.110
Every time we use a module we have to initialize it just for once.

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:30.760
OK.

8
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:36.210
So click here to set sign it signing and sign up methods.

9
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:39.680
And as you can see we have various methods over here.

10
00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:42.660
We're going to choose the email and password.

11
00:00:42.660 --> 00:00:46.850
So this is the most basic one but this is the most used one as well.

12
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.240
So I'm going to say enabled and then save.

13
00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:51.330
And that's it.

14
00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.280
That's all you have to do.

15
00:00:53.310 --> 00:01:00.930
Just you initialize the authentication module then we can go back to our code and start writing code

16
00:01:01.080 --> 00:01:03.510
to start creating users.

17
00:01:03.510 --> 00:01:10.110
So in the database out into storage we're going to do the same thing initialize for the first time and

18
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:11.160
just one time.

19
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.290
But we're going to do that later on.

20
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:21.850
So in the view controller we have our assigning click and sign up clicked methods functions right.

21
00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:28.290
So in this sign up clicked we have to start with signing up because that's where we register a naive

22
00:01:28.290 --> 00:01:31.700
user without having a user we cannot sign them.

23
00:01:31.720 --> 00:01:34.020
And first we have to sign them up.

24
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:38.370
So how do we sign up a user.

25
00:01:38.430 --> 00:01:46.140
Of course we going to use Firebase modules firebase classes in order to use that you have to come over

26
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:50.700
here as a import firebase base and in the sign up click.

27
00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:52.860
I'm going to call this off.

28
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.020
So this is the authentication class for firebase apps.

29
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:01.060
And as you can see it shows up in the description as well.

30
00:02:01.130 --> 00:02:07.370
We're going to use this class in order to create an authentication method in five your base.

31
00:02:07.710 --> 00:02:12.420
Maybe you will have to call this firebase auth as well.

32
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:20.370
Before we had to do it this way we have to call firebase end on base authentication but now we don't

33
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:24.030
have to do that they just combined it in the file your base.

34
00:02:24.060 --> 00:02:30.090
But for a reason if you cannot see us maybe you will have to come back and say import firebase auth

35
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:30.870
as well.

36
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:37.340
And here for the second thing I'm going to call these off the small off.

37
00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:38.040
OK.

38
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:41.560
So this is the instance of the old class.

39
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.230
So this is kind of creating the object out of all the class.

40
00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:54.810
And if you say create user you will see this option create usable with email password and the completion

41
00:02:54.810 --> 00:02:55.100
block.

42
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.800
And that's exactly what we are looking for.

43
00:02:58.960 --> 00:03:01.650
We're going to provide an e-mail and a password.

44
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:05.010
It will give us a completion block in return.

45
00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:05.890
OK.

46
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:12.210
So how are we going to get this e-mail we are going to say e-mail text that text and I can put these

47
00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:19.100
exclamation points in here because I can't force to wrap this and in the password tax that text will

48
00:03:19.110 --> 00:03:21.040
give us the password.

49
00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:22.150
Right.

50
00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.650
So are we going to give the email and password to the user.

51
00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:34.690
Of course before we do that we can check to see if e-mail and password is actually not an empty string.

52
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:35.600
Right.

53
00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:41.190
Because if the user gives us an empty string we don't want to create anything for him.

54
00:03:41.190 --> 00:03:44.280
We really want an e-mail and a password.

55
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:53.610
So I'm going to check to see if e-mail dot text is not equal to an empty string and password that tax

56
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:58.440
password tax law tax is not equal to an empty string as well.

57
00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:04.830
I'm going to open and close this parentheses curly braces I mean I'm going to cut everything in the

58
00:04:04.830 --> 00:04:12.210
authentication method I'm passing in here and else I'm going to display an alert message to the user

59
00:04:12.210 --> 00:04:17.910
saying that you have to give me some password or you have to give me some user name.

60
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:21.810
So let me do that quick because you know how to do that right.

61
00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:30.680
You say Let's alert UI alert controller title will be error message will be maybe username and password

62
00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:32.210
missing or something.

63
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:33.020
OK.

64
00:04:33.150 --> 00:04:39.840
So you can write whatever you want in the message and preferred style hit enter and say dot alerts.

65
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:44.260
And next thing we have to create and button here.

66
00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:50.340
So I'm going to say OK button this is going to be a UI Elliott action as you might remember.

67
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:52.360
So title will be OK.

68
00:04:52.470 --> 00:04:58.290
And sale will be default or cancel and we don't need any handler.

69
00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:03.520
And later on I'm going to add this to my alert saying that Eller doubt add action.

70
00:05:03.620 --> 00:05:09.470
OK button and fight for the final thing I wouldn't say soft dog present.

71
00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.420
I'm going to present the alert.

72
00:05:11.460 --> 00:05:15.510
We've done animation and without any completions.

73
00:05:15.890 --> 00:05:21.580
So that's what we have been doing so far in order to create alerts.

74
00:05:21.590 --> 00:05:24.680
And in here it will give us our results.

75
00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:30.920
So this is kind of a closure and it gives back and completion block for us.

76
00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:32.390
We have seen that before right.

77
00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:37.750
We give some inputs and we get some outputs as a result in here.

78
00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:46.310
And this is the old theater data result an error so you can call this old state our data and you can

79
00:05:46.310 --> 00:05:48.360
call the error error.

80
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:55.310
So of course you can choose whatever name you want in here but I'm going to go for some explicit names

81
00:05:55.310 --> 00:05:57.450
like all data and error.

82
00:05:57.450 --> 00:06:06.320
Now I will begin to check if error is not nil because if the error is not nil then it means that I cannot

83
00:06:06.350 --> 00:06:15.020
even get an au theta where I couldn't create that user for some reason in order to get this error.

84
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:22.910
You can just say errors out localized description and in this block actually error is not nil.

85
00:06:22.910 --> 00:06:26.180
We have to display an alert message to the user as well.

86
00:06:26.300 --> 00:06:30.720
And this time error message will come from the fire base.

87
00:06:30.730 --> 00:06:37.070
We're not even going to bother writing any error messages in here firebase will take care of that for

88
00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.240
us.

89
00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.450
And in Aus we are going to perform a Segway.

90
00:06:41.450 --> 00:06:41.920
Why.

91
00:06:41.990 --> 00:06:44.260
Because we have created the user.

92
00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:47.540
Now we want to go to the feed we have controller right.

93
00:06:47.570 --> 00:06:51.870
So I'm going to say to feed we see and send there will be nil.

94
00:06:52.250 --> 00:06:59.840
And I believe we can copy and paste is alert to the error message in here.

95
00:06:59.840 --> 00:07:07.670
And since we can have so much error messages we can just create an error message function for us as

96
00:07:07.670 --> 00:07:12.590
well and we have some kind of thinking here error message.

97
00:07:12.620 --> 00:07:16.990
We have to say South Park perform Segway because we are enclosure.

98
00:07:17.060 --> 00:07:22.120
Remember enclosures we have to add this SDK up thing.

99
00:07:22.640 --> 00:07:29.540
So rather than copying and pasting this I'm going to create another function here saying make Ellard

100
00:07:29.810 --> 00:07:33.540
I'm going to cut everything in here and paste everything.

101
00:07:33.740 --> 00:07:37.460
So whenever I called his make killer it will call it for me.

102
00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:46.190
So I'm going to take an input of title and message as string because I'm going to pass these parameters

103
00:07:46.610 --> 00:07:47.890
to here.

104
00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:54.710
I don't need any third one so I'm going to come over here on a title and in order to avoid any confusion

105
00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:58.550
I'm going to call this title inputs and message input.

106
00:07:58.820 --> 00:08:04.520
So a title will be title input and the message will be message inputs.

107
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:11.860
We have done this before so you might remember right from the essential spark the beginning of discourse

108
00:08:11.900 --> 00:08:12.890
actually.

109
00:08:12.890 --> 00:08:20.540
So in the make Ellard I'm going to say error and the user name and password missing here but in the

110
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:25.910
above block above us we have the error from the fire base itself.

111
00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:34.160
So I'm going to say make Elliot and title can be error but message input is coming from this error this

112
00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:34.490
time.

113
00:08:34.490 --> 00:08:38.390
OK so I'm going to say error dots localized description.

114
00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:45.800
So this will give us a description that the user can actually understand and this will give us an error

115
00:08:45.800 --> 00:08:51.270
saying that you how to define a default value here.

116
00:08:51.380 --> 00:08:54.610
In case this error gets nil.

117
00:08:55.220 --> 00:09:01.580
So this is an optional as you can see I'm not going to force our wrap this in this way because the error

118
00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:10.310
can come nil for some reason I don't know what but or some empty string I'm going to provide the default

119
00:09:10.310 --> 00:09:10.870
value.

120
00:09:11.390 --> 00:09:16.940
Even though we are checking to see if is not nil I'm not going to take any chances because this is way

121
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:18.310
too easy to implement.

122
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:26.690
You just say to double call the question marks an error and asked us to say self doubt make Ellard because

123
00:09:26.690 --> 00:09:30.700
we are in a closure so far so good.

124
00:09:30.770 --> 00:09:38.480
This way we can actually create the users and we can see if they get created or not because we will

125
00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:39.870
perform a Segway.

126
00:09:39.930 --> 00:09:46.010
And of course we can go back to the firebase and check the authentication module to see if the users

127
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.650
created or not.

128
00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.850
So here if I say sign up it will say user name and password missing.

129
00:09:51.940 --> 00:10:01.350
OK as you can see this got called and let me just write an email address in here like James at a Metallica

130
00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:07.570
dot com and for password let me give one two three or one.

131
00:10:07.620 --> 00:10:14.520
So if I say sign up it will give me an error and this time this is the firebase there as you can see

132
00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:18.240
it says that password must be at least six characters.

133
00:10:18.270 --> 00:10:21.360
So this is the rule for firebase.

134
00:10:21.360 --> 00:10:23.980
It has to be six characters or more.

135
00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:27.060
So we are getting the error message from the firebase as well.

136
00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:28.780
So far so good.

137
00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:31.660
So let me do one two three four five six.

138
00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:39.960
And here we go we are inside of our feed and we can reach to other Tap Bar controllers as well.

139
00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:43.980
So let me go to users tab in the authentication module.

140
00:10:44.100 --> 00:10:45.020
And here we go.

141
00:10:45.030 --> 00:10:48.310
We see James said Metallica dot com.

142
00:10:48.360 --> 00:10:52.490
We see the user unique I.D. This is kind of our you you idea.

143
00:10:52.500 --> 00:11:00.360
But it's created with five your basis for faraway base actually a size this value to us and we see the

144
00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.140
creation dates and signing in date as well.

145
00:11:04.770 --> 00:11:10.020
So that's how we create users using five your base.

146
00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:16.410
And of course it's not enough for us because we have to learn how to sign them in as well.

147
00:11:16.590 --> 00:11:18.570
Let's do that in the next lecture.
