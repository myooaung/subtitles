00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:07.830
Hi within this lecture we going to see how we can bring in the ads in our projects so that we can load

2
00:00:07.830 --> 00:00:12.120
them and then later on we are going to see how we can show them to the user.

3
00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:18.550
But before we do that as you can see we have to initialize the JD mobile ads.

4
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:25.230
So in order to do that I'm just going to copy this line and pasted under my app delegate did finish

5
00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:30.810
launching with options function like we did in the past like we did in the five year base.

6
00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:38.190
So let me copy this line and come over to my app delegate and here I'm going to import Google mobile

7
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:38.960
ads.

8
00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:39.660
OK.

9
00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:44.760
And under this application did finish launching with options.

10
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:49.290
I'm going to paste in the line that I need to run.

11
00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:51.600
So let me run my project and see.

12
00:00:52.020 --> 00:01:00.780
And as you can see we get some error and it says that Yelp does Google utilize framework is not here.

13
00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:09.180
So I believe we need to update our pod in order to make sure we brought in the powers that we really

14
00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:09.840
need.

15
00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:18.030
Since we have brought in them it shouldn't be an issue but I believe it's not working right now.

16
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:24.570
So let me go into my terminal one more time and let me show you how to update your pots.

17
00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:28.940
So I'm gonna go to my project folder one more time.

18
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:37.030
And here I can see the path file but rather than just running poly install I'm just going to run poly

19
00:01:37.110 --> 00:01:39.780
install repo update this time.

20
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:47.790
So if you hit enter you will see that it's updating and the way that I'm running this is with two dashes

21
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:53.920
and one dash between OKAY TWO DASHES repo one dash update.

22
00:01:53.970 --> 00:02:03.540
So this will update my repository so that if I have an outdated pub in my file it will get updated once

23
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:04.280
we do that.

24
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:13.380
I'm just going to try one more time to see if Google utilize is in my project and I believe it won't

25
00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:18.150
take too much time because we have already installed this pass out.

26
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:22.500
It will just update the pods and we will see if this works or not.

27
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:28.230
So let me make this bigger so that we can keep track of what is being updated.

28
00:02:29.010 --> 00:02:36.150
So I believe this is really updated something as you can see it says that four total pods has been installed

29
00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:44.930
and I believe we have by mistake opened this exe called project file rather than workspace.

30
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.150
So I believe this was the issue.

31
00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.330
But anyway we have updated our parts which is not a bad thing.

32
00:02:51.360 --> 00:02:59.340
So let me go over my AOS complete folder and find my project and rather than opening the X code project

33
00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.340
I'm going to open the workspace file.

34
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:09.600
So let me try one more time to see if my project is actually running.

35
00:03:10.170 --> 00:03:17.670
So let me go to app delegates to see if we have the file the initialization line.

36
00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.930
Yep we have it.

37
00:03:18.930 --> 00:03:27.690
So let me run this on our simulator and as you can see few don't pay attention to workspace files.

38
00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:34.550
Your project will not work because you won't have the necessary pods in order to make it work.

39
00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:40.710
So let me run this and let's see if we can see our main screen.

40
00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:48.420
And we won't do much because we haven't brought in the ads yet but if it works then it means that we

41
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:53.600
don't have any problem regarding the integration of the SD case.

42
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.180
So once we see the next button I'm just going to go ahead and continue.

43
00:03:59.190 --> 00:03:59.730
Here you go.

44
00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:05.850
Now we see the next button which means I can continue doing my thing over here.

45
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.580
So I have initialized my Google mobile ads.

46
00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:13.590
Now it's time to select an advertisement format.

47
00:04:13.590 --> 00:04:19.320
So we have this banner format so it's actually the banner that we see in the website.

48
00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:26.520
So it's kind of a rectangle ad that we place most of the time at the bottom of the apps like this are

49
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:28.380
at the top top of the app.

50
00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.530
So it's the most basic advertisement ever.

51
00:04:32.070 --> 00:04:40.560
And here we have this interstitial apps interstitial ads I mean and these are the full screen ads that

52
00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:47.530
we can display to the user when they are trying to go from some level to another level from some we've

53
00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:55.740
controller to another we've controller when we have a natural pulse at our app and I'm going to show

54
00:04:55.740 --> 00:05:03.570
you how to work with interstitial apps and we have some other formats as well.

55
00:05:03.570 --> 00:05:05.880
Like we have these native ads.

56
00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.760
OK.

57
00:05:06.900 --> 00:05:13.030
So this is the ads that we can actually change the format that we can customize.

58
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:20.040
So it's a little bit more complicated than banners and interstitial apps but if you click on implement

59
00:05:20.070 --> 00:05:23.040
native ads you can see it's documentation.

60
00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:27.430
And here we have this rewarded apps ads as well.

61
00:05:27.510 --> 00:05:34.560
And this is the ad format that if you want to give a reward to the user for example if you have a game

62
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.330
and the user runs out of life.

63
00:05:38.370 --> 00:05:45.630
So if if they watch the ad they will get to have one more life or they will get to have one more item

64
00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:48.370
or diamond for example.

65
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.120
So you can use this reward that apps in order to make them watch a video.

66
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:58.020
And it's a lot more complicated than native ads and other ads.

67
00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:03.540
So I'm going to skip it and you can see the documentation if you want but we're going to focus on this

68
00:06:03.540 --> 00:06:04.880
interstitial apps.

69
00:06:04.920 --> 00:06:09.390
So this is one of the most common ads that are used in the apps.

70
00:06:09.390 --> 00:06:12.000
So you have to know how to implement it.

71
00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:18.040
So if you click on it it will take you through the documentation of the interstitial ads.

72
00:06:18.450 --> 00:06:19.320
OK.

73
00:06:19.350 --> 00:06:24.540
So you have to read these guides before you implement it.

74
00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.910
For example you see here you have to implement it.

75
00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:32.910
Then there is a natural transition point in your app.

76
00:06:32.910 --> 00:06:40.650
For example if somebody is trying to go from one level to another in a game or from some weave controller

77
00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:48.510
to another view controller in a game or in a VPN application for example when they hit on START and

78
00:06:48.510 --> 00:06:52.740
VPN starts to work.

79
00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:57.560
So then you can display this interstitial ads in a full screen mode.

80
00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:05.000
So as you can see we don't have any prerequisites rather than its own as the case and we already have

81
00:07:05.010 --> 00:07:11.880
that's all we have to do is bring in the Google Google mobile ads in our we controller and initialize

82
00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:15.010
this interstitial app object AD object.

83
00:07:15.030 --> 00:07:15.740
Okay.

84
00:07:15.780 --> 00:07:22.560
So I'm going to copy this and I'm just going to do copy pasting in this lecture because you have to

85
00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.370
do it.

86
00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:31.140
So sometimes they just change some little things like rather than calling this g I.D. interstitial they

87
00:07:31.140 --> 00:07:39.660
may call this interstitial X from some point on and I believe it's a good practice to read the documentation

88
00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:42.250
and apply what's going on over there.

89
00:07:42.300 --> 00:07:49.770
So I'm going to bring in this Google mobile ads module into my weave controllers so that it won't give

90
00:07:49.770 --> 00:07:55.740
me any error regarding this interstitial G I.D. JD interstitial object.

91
00:07:55.740 --> 00:08:00.360
And once I define that I'm going to initialize it under my we did load.

92
00:08:00.810 --> 00:08:08.490
So here it asks for an ad unit I.D. And this is the test I.D. that you can tested that I'm going to

93
00:08:08.490 --> 00:08:09.770
go for this.

94
00:08:09.870 --> 00:08:14.730
But before you upload this app to the App Store you have to change it as well.

95
00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:22.200
And the way to do that is to go into your ad mop account and get an interstitial ad unit I.D..

96
00:08:22.530 --> 00:08:23.140
OK.

97
00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:30.750
So here you can see it says that always you have to test with test ads and if you come over here to

98
00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:38.850
your app or review in the ad units you can click on this get started to create one interstitial app

99
00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:45.640
and it will give you an I.D. so that you can use that I.D. in your coding section.

100
00:08:45.660 --> 00:08:45.990
OK.

101
00:08:46.020 --> 00:08:51.890
That's how you replace your test ad I.D. with real ad I.D..

102
00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:54.930
So let me go back to my ex code project.

103
00:08:54.930 --> 00:09:03.780
So once you initialize this then you have to bring in the added solve you have to load the app and loading

104
00:09:03.780 --> 00:09:10.980
the ads doesn't necessarily mean showing the ad to the user first you have to load the ad and it will

105
00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.620
be ready to be presented to the user.

106
00:09:13.710 --> 00:09:15.430
And then you present it.

107
00:09:15.490 --> 00:09:17.790
Let's do that in the next lecture.
