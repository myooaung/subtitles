00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:07,260
Hi we didn't this lecture we're going to see how we can use some mathematical calculations in order

2
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:16,110
to make our views relative to the screen size so we gonna get the width and height of the current screen

3
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:17,190
that we are on.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,230
So you know to that I'm going to create two variables.

5
00:00:22,230 --> 00:00:31,070
First of which is that so we can get the vids by real dot frame.

6
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:36,380
So remember we had frame in our label and we had a frame.

7
00:00:36,380 --> 00:00:38,790
We have a frame in our view as well.

8
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:43,860
And the frame of the view is actually the screen size of the phone.

9
00:00:44,700 --> 00:00:52,690
So if I see a view that frame that size that width it gives me the current width right.

10
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,220
So I can do the same thing for the height as well.

11
00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,830
So I'm I'm going to go with that frame that size that height.

12
00:01:01,830 --> 00:01:11,390
So right now I can use those two values in order to create some good mathematical operations.

13
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:24,160
For example I can't say here with multiplied by 0 point five or 0 point 0 or just divided by 2.

14
00:01:24,210 --> 00:01:24,540
Right.

15
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:32,930
So this will take the current that and divide it by two and then place it in the middle of my screen

16
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:42,120
so I can do the same thing in y axis as well I can just take the height okay and divide it by two or

17
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:50,310
just smile supplied by 0 point five and in fact let's multiply them by 0 point five so we can make kids

18
00:01:50,670 --> 00:01:59,460
0 point 4 0 point forty five if we're not satisfied with the result later on and in fact I can do the

19
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,320
same thing for width and height as well right.

20
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:11,700
I can just say that make with like 80 percent of the current screen size and make height like 5 percent

21
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,660
of the current security size.

22
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,830
So let's do that let's see widths multiplied by 80.

23
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:26,790
And height I don't think we have to go with relative size over here we can just do like something like

24
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,570
50 because we just create and get taxed.

25
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:35,160
Maybe if I was working on an image I can go relative own height as well.

26
00:02:35,430 --> 00:02:37,260
But right now I don't need that.

27
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:40,380
So let me run this and see how this works.

28
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:46,280
If I manage to put it in the middle of my screen as you can see.

29
00:02:46,830 --> 00:02:53,570
So we're somewhere close so in the y axis we are somewhere in the middle right.

30
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:57,480
But in the x axis we're not even close.

31
00:02:57,480 --> 00:02:58,610
We're not in the middle.

32
00:02:58,620 --> 00:03:00,900
So we're skewed to the right.

33
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:02,550
So why does that happen.

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:06,880
So let me tell you this in a visual way.

35
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:14,070
Suppose that this is our screen and we are creating a text label over here right.

36
00:03:14,070 --> 00:03:16,420
So our label looks like this.

37
00:03:16,890 --> 00:03:21,880
So we're creating a width of 80 percent and height of 50.

38
00:03:21,930 --> 00:03:28,980
So we're trying to place this into the middle like this but we're doing this instead of placing this

39
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,000
into middle.

40
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,280
We are seeing that start from X multiplied by 0 point 5.

41
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,760
So it's starting from the middle but it has its own width as well so it overflows to the right hand

42
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:42,050
side.

43
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:44,650
So we don't get what we want.

44
00:03:44,670 --> 00:03:55,170
Instead we have to started from not here but something around here in order to find this point we have

45
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:03,830
to actually find the X middle looks like we THAT AND SUBTRACT THE HALF OF THIS.

46
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:06,070
IT'S OVER HERE FROM HERE.

47
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:06,840
OKAY.

48
00:04:06,870 --> 00:04:13,260
SO IF I subtract half of this bit from the X point I can't find this starting point.

49
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:14,470
Right.

50
00:04:14,490 --> 00:04:17,090
So I can do that for the y value as well.

51
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:25,020
And y valued doesn't seem to be causing problems because we made this vat y value like something like

52
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:25,590
50.

53
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,750
So it's a little so it doesn't cause any problems or it doesn't seem to be causing.

54
00:04:32,370 --> 00:04:37,930
But it's actually something like this right now.

55
00:04:37,980 --> 00:04:44,510
So we have to make sure that this stays here and here in order to be centered.

56
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:47,660
So let's go back to X core then do that.

57
00:04:49,270 --> 00:04:49,680
Okay.

58
00:04:49,710 --> 00:04:58,780
So I have to find a way to make sure that the half of this with is subtracted from the x axis.

59
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:03,680
So this would be in the middle of this x axis.

60
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:12,110
I'm going to do that for the y value as well so that it will be on the y axis half of the y axis.

61
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:12,570
Okay.

62
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:20,550
And this is a very good way so that you can find the middle screen middle point of the screen and you

63
00:05:20,550 --> 00:05:28,920
can actually place this other views that you're going to have in your app are relative to this point

64
00:05:28,920 --> 00:05:30,180
as well.

65
00:05:30,180 --> 00:05:36,300
So let me try to subtract the vids or half off of it from here.

66
00:05:36,600 --> 00:05:39,660
So I currently have 0 point 8.

67
00:05:39,930 --> 00:05:42,720
So if I say something like this.

68
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:44,630
So let's see.

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:48,370
Can I get the exact weave that I want.

70
00:05:48,480 --> 00:05:57,060
As you can see now I have this test label on the middle of the x axis so we can go and do that for the

71
00:05:57,060 --> 00:05:57,990
Y as well.

72
00:05:57,990 --> 00:06:10,050
So rather than saying kite multiplied by all point 5 I can come over here and deduct 50 or 285 actually

73
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:11,040
from here.

74
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:20,910
So 50 divided by 2 so you may understand what's going on when you go back and look your notes.

75
00:06:20,910 --> 00:06:21,780
So here we go.

76
00:06:21,780 --> 00:06:28,440
We managed to create a label and we managed to put it on the middle of the screen using mathematical

77
00:06:28,710 --> 00:06:38,100
operations so we can do that for other views as well because we have our width and height variables

78
00:06:38,100 --> 00:06:39,930
right now created.

79
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:49,050
We can use this technique in order to create some relative views and we can exactly find where it's

80
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:54,750
supposed to be located on the screen in different sizes.

81
00:06:54,750 --> 00:07:02,640
So right now it doesn't matter if you're working on an iPhone AC or iPhone 6 these sizes will be relative

82
00:07:02,850 --> 00:07:05,970
to the iPhone screen size.

83
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,320
So let's stop here and within the next lecture we're going to see how we can create a bottom.

84
00:07:11,460 --> 00:07:13,530
Using this technique.
