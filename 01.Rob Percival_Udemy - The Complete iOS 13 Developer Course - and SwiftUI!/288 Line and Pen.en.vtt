00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.320
Hi.

2
00:00:01.410 --> 00:00:07.500
We didn't like you re going to see the other use like pen over here line.

3
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:09.530
So let me show you how this works.

4
00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:11.710
So let me select this line.

5
00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.170
If I hold onto shifts it will ask me to.

6
00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:20.940
It will actually guide me to draw a straight line like this.

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:27.740
If I don't hold onto shift I can just create a line in any way that I want.

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:35.610
But as you can see if I hold onto shift it will only create it will only let me to create lines in like

9
00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.250
45 degrees or 90 degrees.

10
00:00:38.390 --> 00:00:39.150
OK.

11
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:46.210
So we're here I can just change the border because I don't have a feel option right now since I'm in

12
00:00:46.340 --> 00:00:47.000
line.

13
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:55.320
I can increase the size of the line by clicking over here and using my Up Arrow or down arrow in my

14
00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:59.030
keyboard or I can just write whatever I want over here.

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:04.530
If I increase the dashes it will just dash me up over here.

16
00:01:04.530 --> 00:01:05.310
Okay.

17
00:01:05.490 --> 00:01:09.850
And I can even specify the gaps between the dashes as well.

18
00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:17.100
So let's see the other features over here because we have been focusing on the same features in every

19
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.030
view.

20
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:20.940
So let me make this zero.

21
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:29.140
And as you can see now I get to change this in a way that I want when I hit the select tool.

22
00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:31.770
So let me come over here and show you something.

23
00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.940
If I choose this round cap thing it will round the caps up.

24
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.710
So let me zoom in so you can see it better.

25
00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:42.990
As you can see now I have a round top.

26
00:01:43.030 --> 00:01:50.340
If I choose this or this it will have a sharp edge over here but if I chose this it will have a round

27
00:01:50.340 --> 00:01:50.790
match.

28
00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.520
So it's pretty easy to do that.

29
00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:02.070
And now I can get to change this or make it bigger or smaller in in way that I want.

30
00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:08.910
And if I comment and command V I can just copy and paste this using my keyboard.

31
00:02:09.010 --> 00:02:14.370
I can just do something like this to create an X shape for example.

32
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:15.610
Okay.

33
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.350
And as you can see there there are some guidelines showing media alignment so I can create the exact

34
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:33.000
same line over here so that I can have an x so that we can create an Amsterdam logo out of.

35
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:33.850
So right.

36
00:02:33.900 --> 00:02:41.910
So let me do an x and then we're going to copied this three times to have an Amsterdam logo.

37
00:02:41.910 --> 00:02:50.830
For example I can just choose this X and rather than copying and pasting it I'm going to use this grid

38
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:51.550
think.

39
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:52.380
And here you go.

40
00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:58.800
Now I have the same max three times so let me just change the color.

41
00:02:58.860 --> 00:02:59.750
And here you go.

42
00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:08.720
We have a beautiful three X Amsterdam logo so you can do stuff like this very easily very interactive.

43
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.110
As you can see.

44
00:03:10.230 --> 00:03:13.420
So does it though beaks is actually very intelligent.

45
00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:19.650
It understands what you're trying to do it's actually guides you to do that as well.

46
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:24.240
So let me try some other feature called pen.

47
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:32.370
It's actually very easy to use better but very hard to master because as you can see it actually doesn't

48
00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.410
stop after a click or is somewhere it just goes on and on and on.

49
00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:39.300
If I hit escape it will stop.

50
00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:47.730
Of course but it's hard to master it is because you can do shapes like this and you can fill them up.

51
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:54.120
You can change the color you can change the border in a way that you want but you will be creating you

52
00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:58.470
will be drawing the shape yourself by using this pen.

53
00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.470
So if you do something wrong it won't look good.

54
00:04:01.830 --> 00:04:06.960
After that of course you can double click and edit this in a way that you want.

55
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:08.390
So it's not very hard.

56
00:04:08.430 --> 00:04:17.630
But if you try to do something like this by bending the shapes or changing some points like this and

57
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.780
you you have to be a little bit skilled to do that so that it won't look bad.

58
00:04:23.820 --> 00:04:30.600
So we're here we have some sharp turns or small turns like this if you just choose one of them.

59
00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:39.120
It will try to smooth up these edges smooth up these corners so that we won't have sharp corners like

60
00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:39.510
this.

61
00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:40.340
OK.

62
00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:42.700
So this is like around the captain.

63
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:44.340
You can just choose it.

64
00:04:44.340 --> 00:04:51.060
So right now we doesn't really show a fact because we have a very small area over here maybe you can

65
00:04:51.060 --> 00:04:52.310
see the difference.

66
00:04:52.350 --> 00:04:54.320
I can't even hardly see it.

67
00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:04.440
But in other shapes you can use this like we did in the round the think OK so you can try this on your

68
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:10.580
own time to see if it's really makes a difference if it's really makes it smooth or not.

69
00:05:11.070 --> 00:05:14.390
So that's it for Penn and that's it for line.

70
00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:18.900
So we're going to see those examples later on when we practice the skills.

71
00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.040
Don't worry.

72
00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.750
We're going to stop you right now.

73
00:05:21.750 --> 00:05:24.900
We're going to continue with the next views on the next lecture.
