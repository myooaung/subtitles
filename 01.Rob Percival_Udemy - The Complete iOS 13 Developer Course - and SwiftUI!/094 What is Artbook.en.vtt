00:00:00.830 --> 00:00:06.890
High within the section where are you going to learn how to work with databases with a tool called core

2
00:00:06.890 --> 00:00:09.530
data in order to do that.

3
00:00:09.590 --> 00:00:18.970
You going to build an art book in which our user will actually save the art that he or she would like.

4
00:00:18.980 --> 00:00:23.970
Suppose that she is going through a museum and she likes the Mona Lisa.

5
00:00:23.990 --> 00:00:27.900
She takes a picture of it and she saves the picture.

6
00:00:27.920 --> 00:00:30.620
She writes down the name of the art.

7
00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:31.030
OK.

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:32.090
Like Mona Lisa.

9
00:00:32.090 --> 00:00:38.900
Here she writes down the painter and the year that this painting has been created.

10
00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:47.150
And she says it is art by clicking on this plus button OK and choosing the image that she has taken.

11
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:51.620
So suppose that we are going to save the starry nights next.

12
00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:53.690
So she choses this picture.

13
00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:54.010
OK.

14
00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:55.260
From the gallery.

15
00:00:55.370 --> 00:00:57.390
And it shows up as you can see.

16
00:00:57.470 --> 00:01:01.100
And she says that she is staring down the starry nights.

17
00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.780
And the artist is one go.

18
00:01:04.010 --> 00:01:09.160
And the year that this painting has been created is nineteen hundred.

19
00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:11.300
As you can see it shows up in the list.

20
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:18.950
And if she clicks on this she sees the details of the picture or details of the art that has been saved

21
00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:19.740
before.

22
00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:23.230
Where are we going to learn how to do that within databases.

23
00:01:23.810 --> 00:01:30.290
So as you can see we're going to learn a lot more things in this app as well.

24
00:01:30.290 --> 00:01:33.130
For example how to choose an image from the gallery.

25
00:01:33.140 --> 00:01:37.040
How to make this bottom are not clickable.

26
00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:39.610
How to make this bottom invisible.

27
00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:48.200
How to just save all this information in a database so that even if this app gets closed or opened up

28
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.720
later on this information will stay on.

29
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:55.790
We're going to see how to delete those information from database as well.

30
00:01:56.840 --> 00:02:03.530
So this is going to be great in order to practice working with local databases and by local I mean we're

31
00:02:03.530 --> 00:02:07.640
storing all of this information in the memory of the iPhone.

32
00:02:08.510 --> 00:02:14.180
So if you're ready we're going to sup here and we're going to continue within the next lecture by creating

33
00:02:14.180 --> 00:02:17.450
our project and doing the initial setup for core data.
