Hi within this section where are going to learn about table leaves.

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:07.890
So we're going to create this design.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:13.540
So this is a table view in which we display collection of data sets.

4
00:00:13.620 --> 00:00:19.620
So we're getting this from an array and we're going to create a landmark book.

5
00:00:19.840 --> 00:00:20.270
OK.

6
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:28.110
So if you click one of these landmarks it will show you a related image and the name of the landmark.

7
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:36.900
So this may look so simple to you right now but actually after you learn how to do this you can improve

8
00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:38.190
this any way you want.

9
00:00:38.190 --> 00:00:46.170
Like you can add some descriptions over here like detailed descriptions you can add a map later on when

10
00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.010
you know how to do that.

11
00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.280
You can add the Taj Mahal country or other information as well.

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:01:01.290
So this will be a great opportunity for you to learn about table views and learn about how to work with

13
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:08.550
to screen apps and how to pass data between them how to work with data is in error.

14
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.930
So if you're ready let's get started within the next lecture.
