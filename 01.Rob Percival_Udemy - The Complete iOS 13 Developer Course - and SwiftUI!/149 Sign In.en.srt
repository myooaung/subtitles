00:00:01,110 --> 00:00:01,630
Hi.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:09,090
We didn't this lecture regrowing to see how we can sign the previously created users in and how we can

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:13,720
log them out so that we can complete the authentication process.

4
00:00:13,890 --> 00:00:20,570
So in here rather than doing just a Segway I'm going to delete here and we're going to use this oath

5
00:00:20,910 --> 00:00:24,860
again in order to sign the users in.

6
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,010
So let me just start by typing out.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:34,920
And of course we can check to see if email dot tags is not an empty string again because if they're

8
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:42,300
actually empty strings we don't just want to send a request to the server we just want to display an

9
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:44,760
alert message to the user as usual.

10
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:54,840
So let's say that password tax dot tax is not an empty string then I'm going to do my thing and else

11
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:02,770
I'm going to display a message to my users saying that this error username and password.

12
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:04,220
OK.

13
00:01:04,410 --> 00:01:11,220
So in here I'm going to use the fourth class from the fire your base one more time so I'm going to say

14
00:01:11,310 --> 00:01:12,970
off that's all.

15
00:01:13,110 --> 00:01:13,410
OK.

16
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:21,120
So I'm creating the instance again and rather than saying create user I'm going to say not to log in

17
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,570
but sign in.

18
00:01:22,760 --> 00:01:23,360
OK.

19
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:31,870
If you write sign you will see a sign out and you will see a sign in and we're interested in that.

20
00:01:32,010 --> 00:01:34,550
So sign in with email password.

21
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,860
And of course a completion block.

22
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:44,670
So this is exactly what we're looking for we're just going to provide an email and then a password.

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:48,430
So the email will come from email text not taxed.

24
00:01:48,510 --> 00:01:49,830
OK.

25
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:58,230
And you can just force unwrap this and for Password Password taxed dot tax you can force our up does

26
00:01:58,230 --> 00:01:59,020
as well.

27
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:03,510
And in the completion block if you hit enter it will give you data.

28
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:04,230
OK.

29
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,440
So all theta and error.

30
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:11,750
So if you say error is not nil if error is not nil.

31
00:02:11,780 --> 00:02:14,700
We're going to display an alert message one more time.

32
00:02:14,700 --> 00:02:21,750
So I'm going to copy and paste this s dot make Ellar think in here it will get this error from this

33
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:22,730
error this time.

34
00:02:22,740 --> 00:02:26,070
So it gets reflected over here OK.

35
00:02:26,180 --> 00:02:32,400
And if it's not nil it means that if it's nil actually it means that we're good to go.

36
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:34,620
So we can perform a Segway.

37
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,910
So we are doing the same thing basically but rather than creating the user we're just signing them in.

38
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:48,250
And this is a very cool feature because it's actually checks the password of the user.

39
00:02:48,270 --> 00:02:54,100
So if we give the wrong password it displays the alert message for us.

40
00:02:54,180 --> 00:03:00,900
So let's test that leads alerted Metallica dot com we don't have that user right now.

41
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:06,930
So rather than saying sign up if I say sign in as you can see we get this error message it says that

42
00:03:06,930 --> 00:03:08,750
there is no user.

43
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:09,390
So.

44
00:03:09,420 --> 00:03:11,130
So that's good right.

45
00:03:11,130 --> 00:03:18,690
We know what we're dealing with in here so we get this cool error messages from firebase.

46
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:24,240
Let's do it with James but I'm giving wrong passwords one more time and as you can see it says that

47
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:27,270
password is invalid.

48
00:03:27,270 --> 00:03:32,580
So let's do James with the real passwords One two three four five six.

49
00:03:32,580 --> 00:03:35,200
And if I click on sign in here you go.

50
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,780
I'm signed in and it took me to the feet.

51
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:42,020
So it's going good.

52
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:50,410
We have created the user we manage sign in process all tanks due to firebase.

53
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,250
We tried that with the regular server without any back and support.

54
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,520
We will have to write tons of code in order to make this happen.

55
00:03:59,570 --> 00:04:03,480
And thanks to the free rays we did it with a stamp over a finger.

56
00:04:03,500 --> 00:04:04,110
OK.

57
00:04:04,370 --> 00:04:08,250
So we are now inside of our feed we've controller.

58
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:16,160
But the thing is if I close these app and open it one more time it will ask me to give my credentials

59
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:17,150
again.

60
00:04:17,150 --> 00:04:19,490
So this is not we want.

61
00:04:19,490 --> 00:04:25,010
We want to remember if user has checked in signed in or not.

62
00:04:25,010 --> 00:04:30,460
So every time I open the app I just don't want to give my credentials right.

63
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:33,950
Because nobody will use my app if I asked them.

64
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:39,000
So we have to come up with a way to solve this problem.

65
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:48,140
And in fact firebase has this capability to check if a user has signed in or signed out before.

66
00:04:48,170 --> 00:04:54,080
So in the We've did loads in my weave controller I'm going to show you how to do that.

67
00:04:54,170 --> 00:04:56,840
So we're going to use off again.

68
00:04:56,930 --> 00:05:00,920
And if you say of that of that current user.

69
00:05:00,950 --> 00:05:01,580
OK.

70
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:04,680
This one the current user.

71
00:05:05,180 --> 00:05:08,880
It gives you an optional user as you can see.

72
00:05:09,170 --> 00:05:13,730
And if this is nil it means that nobody has signed in.

73
00:05:14,210 --> 00:05:19,550
If this is not snail it means that somebody has signed in before.

74
00:05:19,550 --> 00:05:27,200
So if you sign this to a variable and if you check to see if current user is not nailed it means that

75
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,900
there is somebody already signed in before.

76
00:05:30,770 --> 00:05:40,040
So I'm going to say if current user is not now then it means that I have a user and I can try to do

77
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:46,840
a Segway from this view controller to feed controller for example.

78
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:55,220
And this is what we did before actually when I run this you will see that this won't even work but I'm

79
00:05:55,220 --> 00:06:01,880
going to show you anyway because if you google it if you Google have to remember user in the firebase

80
00:06:02,030 --> 00:06:04,840
IOW Swift you will get this code.

81
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:08,870
But but in fact this is not what you're looking for.

82
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:16,190
So let me just sign in one more time James at Metallica dot com and let's say sign and it will sign

83
00:06:16,190 --> 00:06:16,980
me in.

84
00:06:17,060 --> 00:06:23,690
But if I run this from the scratch it should have taken me to feed the view controller anyway because

85
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,580
we have signed in before.

86
00:06:25,580 --> 00:06:31,050
But even though I try again as you can see I cannot go to the feed controller.

87
00:06:31,220 --> 00:06:34,990
So that's not the way that we want to execute this code.

88
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,190
We want to get this code and execute that in the scene delegate.

89
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:47,990
So far we haven't seen scene delegate yet and this is a great opportunity for us to learn how to do

90
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:50,600
stuff in the scene delegate as well.

91
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:55,190
So what I'm going to do I'm going to cut all of this from the weave controller.

92
00:06:55,190 --> 00:07:01,970
OK very not going to check this in the weave controllers so let me select everything and hit command

93
00:07:02,030 --> 00:07:05,330
X and let's go to scene delegate.

94
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:11,450
So we want to do it in here because we have a variable called window in this scene delegate.

95
00:07:11,480 --> 00:07:12,480
OK.

96
00:07:12,620 --> 00:07:19,490
Before we have this in the app delegates now we have this in the scene delegate so is seen delegate

97
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,070
we are going to do this check.

98
00:07:23,300 --> 00:07:29,690
And if you have this window in app delegate for any reason I don't know maybe you're using an early

99
00:07:29,690 --> 00:07:31,190
version of X code.

100
00:07:31,220 --> 00:07:33,850
Now you have to do this inside of Abdullah.

101
00:07:34,190 --> 00:07:37,960
But after U.S. star 13 there is a scene delegate.

102
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:44,780
And in this scene there is a function called I will connect to session and that's very we can change

103
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:45,440
this scene.

104
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:52,980
That's where we can change the window and by window I mean we're going to change the route we've controller.

105
00:07:53,120 --> 00:08:00,830
As you can see if we change this entry point it defines which we've controller is going to be shown

106
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:08,720
first when we actually start this app and we're going to take this arrow to the tab bar controller if

107
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:11,990
and only if a user has signed in before.

108
00:08:12,290 --> 00:08:12,900
OK.

109
00:08:12,990 --> 00:08:15,410
We're going to do this program ethically.

110
00:08:15,410 --> 00:08:21,110
We're going to do this within codes and in order to do that I have to come to tab our controller and

111
00:08:21,110 --> 00:08:30,680
in the storyboard I.D. I have to give it an I.D. like tab bar and I'm going to use that tab bar in here.

112
00:08:30,680 --> 00:08:31,280
OK.

113
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:39,600
So let me paste this here and of course this will give me an error because we cannot do a Segway from

114
00:08:39,620 --> 00:08:44,110
here right because we're not in the view controller.

115
00:08:44,280 --> 00:08:50,900
We're just in the scene delegate now and we are just going to check to see if current user is not.

116
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:51,660
No.

117
00:08:51,730 --> 00:08:57,300
And in order to check this make sure that firebase is actually imported in the scene delegates.

118
00:08:57,310 --> 00:09:07,480
If it's not you have to add it yourself like import Firebase and then it's going to be like this.

119
00:09:07,480 --> 00:09:12,880
I'm going to check if the current user is not Bill and if it's not Neil I'm learning to change the root

120
00:09:12,950 --> 00:09:19,690
of controller I'm going to move that arrow to the tab bar controller in order to do that I'm going to

121
00:09:19,690 --> 00:09:25,880
create a board variable in which I will create my UI storyboard.

122
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:27,890
So what's the name of my storyboard.

123
00:09:27,910 --> 00:09:28,600
Its main.

124
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:37,330
With a capital A capital M K and the bundle is nil and this is my storyboard actually so I can create

125
00:09:37,570 --> 00:09:40,310
a view controller using that storyboard.

126
00:09:40,420 --> 00:09:42,320
I'm going to call this tab bar.

127
00:09:42,460 --> 00:09:46,370
I'm going to say bored dot instantiate v controller.

128
00:09:46,450 --> 00:09:47,810
So here you go.

129
00:09:47,830 --> 00:09:49,240
We have this option.

130
00:09:49,240 --> 00:09:57,670
Instantiate view controller with identifier so we how created the identifiers for tab bar right.

131
00:09:57,670 --> 00:10:00,870
So if you read the description we can create.

132
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:07,260
We can represent its view controller using that instantiate you controller.

133
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:15,160
I remember we had to cast as as UI tab bar controller because our tab our controller doesn't have any

134
00:10:15,160 --> 00:10:18,310
class it's just a UI tab bar controller.

135
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:26,680
For example if I tried to assign my settings view controller as a variable here I had to I would then

136
00:10:26,680 --> 00:10:35,080
have to cast as as settings controller bots right now in class I don't have anything so I'm just gonna

137
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:42,700
cast is as UI tab bar controller so remember if you're dealing with a specific class then you have to

138
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,980
cast this as a specific class.

139
00:10:45,100 --> 00:10:51,880
Then I'm going to come over here and say window data route where you controller and this is tab bar

140
00:10:51,910 --> 00:11:01,660
and this is exactly where I take the arrow and put it inside of my in front of my actually tab bar and

141
00:11:01,660 --> 00:11:07,010
we're doing this only and only if the current user is not now.

142
00:11:08,110 --> 00:11:16,960
So let me open this and try and as you can see we're in the feed we have controller we haven't got to

143
00:11:16,960 --> 00:11:25,570
see the sign and we have controller ads all because we have already signed in before now we had to find

144
00:11:25,570 --> 00:11:30,550
a way to log out so that we can test if this works or not.

145
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,330
And in the settings are you controller you're just performing a Segway.

146
00:11:34,330 --> 00:11:38,580
But this is actually wrong right now because we have to sign out.

147
00:11:38,650 --> 00:11:46,030
We had to let firebase know that we have signed out so I'm going to impart firebase in here as well

148
00:11:46,290 --> 00:11:52,210
and I'm going to delete this because first we need to sign out then we're going to perform this.

149
00:11:52,420 --> 00:11:59,800
So I'm going to call all that all that sign out and as you can see throws an error.

150
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:01,140
So what do we do.

151
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:05,410
We get and chose syntax in here.

152
00:12:05,410 --> 00:12:11,520
We have to use do try catch structure if you remember we have to say do try.

153
00:12:11,560 --> 00:12:12,610
What are we going to try.

154
00:12:12,610 --> 00:12:20,000
We're going to try out that old Dot sign out and we're going to catch the error if there is any.

155
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:24,180
And for right now I can just do a print error.

156
00:12:24,310 --> 00:12:26,510
OK and.

157
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:33,740
And then actually I can do perform say great thing in here and there are two ways to do that.

158
00:12:33,740 --> 00:12:42,400
The complex ways to go to the scene delegates and call the function that we have written before.

159
00:12:42,490 --> 00:12:49,190
In order to check if there is any signs in user and change the view controller route we controller one

160
00:12:49,270 --> 00:12:50,320
more time.

161
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:56,560
But I'm not going to do that I'm not going to bother just taking all of this I'm putting into a function

162
00:12:56,590 --> 00:13:04,090
and then trying to define this as as seen delegates variable and then try to reach that function.

163
00:13:04,120 --> 00:13:05,250
Yeah they are there.

164
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:12,310
It's it's an alternative but it's I'm not going to do that because it's going to make this a lot more

165
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,720
complicated than it should be.

166
00:13:14,740 --> 00:13:23,650
Rather after trying this I'm just going to say SDR perform dots s stock perform Segway and the identifier

167
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:29,430
that I'm looking for is to weave controller and the sender is nil.

168
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:37,700
So let me go to my main story board and by doing that let me check the Segway name.

169
00:13:37,720 --> 00:13:38,260
Yep.

170
00:13:38,270 --> 00:13:40,060
2 We have controller.

171
00:13:40,070 --> 00:13:43,490
So now I'm certain that this will work.

172
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:51,660
But let's just test to see because I'm going to go into the field controller once I hit that because

173
00:13:51,660 --> 00:14:00,230
I'm already signed in now I'm going to sign out OK so log out and now we see this sign in.

174
00:14:00,330 --> 00:14:06,690
But in order to make sure we have to run this one more time then we can.

175
00:14:06,690 --> 00:14:09,380
We have to see designing we have a controller now.

176
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:09,800
Yeah.

177
00:14:09,840 --> 00:14:10,490
Here we go.

178
00:14:10,490 --> 00:14:14,740
We see the signing we have controllers since we don't have any users signed in.

179
00:14:15,190 --> 00:14:17,920
Let's sign in with one of the users.

180
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,480
Okay let's go for James at Metallica dot com and the password is 1 2 3 4 5 6.

181
00:14:23,490 --> 00:14:31,640
Let's sign in and let's run one more time to make sure this is working properly.

182
00:14:31,650 --> 00:14:32,640
Here you go.

183
00:14:32,640 --> 00:14:40,050
Now this is working properly and officially we have completed the authentication module now.

184
00:14:40,050 --> 00:14:49,290
Next thing to do for us to understand how to upload data to the database so that we can retrieve those

185
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:52,980
information and show them to the user later on.
