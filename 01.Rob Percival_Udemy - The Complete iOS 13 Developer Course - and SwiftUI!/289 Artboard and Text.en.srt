Hi within this lecture we going to see the text and the outburst.

2
00:00:05,010 --> 00:00:11,940
So let's start with tax because it's pretty easy you can just write something when you choose tax like

3
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:16,530
this OK and you get to change its properties over here.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,890
Like this you can just make it lower case upper case you can just make this a superscript subscript

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:30,990
you can change its alignment you can change its form like this but in order to change the font in order

6
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:38,010
to increase the font size you have to make sure that you have enough space like this OK so that it would

7
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:39,890
take effect.

8
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:48,180
So if you hit your upper arrow over here you can increase the font size you can change the font by clicking

9
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:55,670
over here like that and you can even change the full color of the font like that.

10
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:56,180
OK.

11
00:00:56,190 --> 00:01:02,400
So you can change any color that you want from the coloring spectra were here and you can do it.

12
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:09,900
You can even give some borders to your fonts and you can even give some shadows as well.

13
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:18,000
So it's pretty easy to work that text like that and if you double click on a attacks you get to edit

14
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:18,440
it.

15
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:24,890
And in this case editing means just adding some new characters or leading the characters.

16
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:32,160
So as an example let me delete everything from here and we can do the tap to select in image thing that

17
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:34,990
we have done in the previous section.

18
00:01:35,020 --> 00:01:39,940
OK so let me create a rectangle right now like that.

19
00:01:40,020 --> 00:01:40,840
OK.

20
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:49,530
And let me delete the border so that I can come over here to tag so I can just create a text or a year

21
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:51,550
and say tap to select.

22
00:01:51,660 --> 00:01:58,830
After that I can just select the select tool and just make does a little bit bigger.

23
00:01:59,070 --> 00:02:07,550
And then I'm going to give some white color to my text and let me put this over here and try to adjust

24
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,670
is a little bit so that it would be more central like that.

25
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:12,450
So here you go.

26
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:19,590
Now we can export this and use it on our projects and we're going to see how to export we use and how

27
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,240
to use an x code later on.

28
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:22,200
Don't worry.

29
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:28,500
Right now I'm just doing some practice to show you that you can really easily create visuals to your

30
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:35,490
using your own apps and there is a zoom over here and it's pretty basic so if you just choose it you

31
00:02:35,490 --> 00:02:37,620
can zoom in or zoom out like that.

32
00:02:37,850 --> 00:02:38,740
OK.

33
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:41,170
And here we have the art part.

34
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:47,910
So if you choose the art part if you click some are some there over here in your password it will just

35
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:50,290
add a new art part.

36
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:54,000
And as we have discussed before art birds are just too great.

37
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:54,320
Great.

38
00:02:54,320 --> 00:03:02,850
Give us some frames so that we can easily do our design like that so we can just choose any size that

39
00:03:02,850 --> 00:03:11,250
we want from here like an iPhone or an eye pad or an Android phone and we get to change its size once

40
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:12,840
we created like that.

41
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:20,070
So I you can just create any art bird that you want that you can use it like a frame or we're here and

42
00:03:20,070 --> 00:03:27,530
we can actually put some views in the pasteboard as well but we generally prefer doing that in the airports

43
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:32,590
so that we can really see what will our design look like in the real foam.

44
00:03:33,270 --> 00:03:33,580
OK.

45
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:41,040
So that's why we're using art boards actually to be more structural to be much more organized and to

46
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,120
see better what our design will look like in the real life.

47
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,220
So let's stop here and continue within the next lecture.
