00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:05,940
Hi within this lecture regrowing to learn about view controller lifecycle.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,010
So what does it even mean.

3
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:13,520
So real controllers has actually a lifecycle they get created.

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:20,990
They get disappeared they will reappear one more time and there are certain functions like we did load

5
00:00:20,990 --> 00:00:29,020
over here which actually defines what will happen when that event is going to be executed.

6
00:00:29,070 --> 00:00:31,770
For example what do we do when we load.

7
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:33,470
We want to write.

8
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,970
What will happen when user first opens they wrap.

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:45,420
Right but in fact there are a lot more functions like this and we need to learn about them so we can

10
00:00:45,420 --> 00:00:47,430
leverage them in a better way.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:55,260
So let me open my simulator because I'm going to run and show you in the simulator in real time.

12
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:04,130
OK re going to call these other functions and we going to see then and there they're going to be executed.

13
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,180
So when I got second view controller for instance what happens in the background.

14
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:12,600
So when I go back what happens in the background.

15
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:15,510
We try and see that.

16
00:01:15,990 --> 00:01:24,150
So we have two different views over here but I'm going to show these functions inside of our view controller

17
00:01:24,160 --> 00:01:28,810
that swerved so that we can keep track what's being called.

18
00:01:28,830 --> 00:01:34,710
So let me show you the other functions that we have been talking about so that you will understand it

19
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:35,180
better.

20
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:36,590
In an example.

21
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:43,740
So if you come over here under your reloaded loads we are not inside of we would not be inside of class.

22
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:49,840
So if you write veal did you can see veal did disappear like we did lot.

23
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:50,470
Okay.

24
00:01:50,730 --> 00:01:54,420
So we're going to called as we did disappear.

25
00:01:54,420 --> 00:01:57,120
So as you can see does not find the view controller.

26
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:00,460
That view is actually disappeared.

27
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:07,170
So we have a lot of functions like this and in order to keep track what's being called.

28
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,490
I'm just going to print the names.

29
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:12,180
So we did disappear.

30
00:02:12,180 --> 00:02:13,440
Function called.

31
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:14,960
OK.

32
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:19,590
So we can actually do what we want in this.

33
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:25,880
We did disappear like we can set our labels we can just delete our data.

34
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:32,310
We can do whatever we want but for right now I'm just going to call all of this.

35
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:38,230
For example we will disappear and I'm going to print out so we can see them.

36
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:40,770
And why do they get called.

37
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,240
So we will disappear.

38
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:46,340
Function calls and we have some more.

39
00:02:46,380 --> 00:02:47,960
Let me write veal.

40
00:02:48,240 --> 00:02:48,480
Yeah.

41
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:50,480
We have we will appear.

42
00:02:50,600 --> 00:02:52,980
Okay so.

43
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:56,040
And the names are actually self explanatory.

44
00:02:56,050 --> 00:03:00,110
So this will be called when the view is about to appear.

45
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:01,570
Okay.

46
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:03,630
And we will appear.

47
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,110
Function cold.

48
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,490
Okay.

49
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:13,130
And we did load we did disappear we will disappear and we should have one more.

50
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:19,040
And by the way you may think that why did you wait so much in order to tell us about this.

51
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:24,350
I waited enough so that we will have two views to test this.

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,260
Okay so you will understand much better.

53
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:29,860
So Leslie I'm going to call.

54
00:03:29,860 --> 00:03:36,970
We did appear so this is Will is about to appear and the below one.

55
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:37,650
Yeah we do.

56
00:03:37,800 --> 00:03:39,330
Has appeared already.

57
00:03:39,410 --> 00:03:40,060
OK.

58
00:03:40,130 --> 00:03:42,030
Are we going to see that in action as well.

59
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:42,620
Don't worry.

60
00:03:42,630 --> 00:03:47,760
So we did appear function calls.

61
00:03:47,880 --> 00:03:48,630
So here we go.

62
00:03:48,630 --> 00:03:56,010
We have a lot of functions defining our view controller lifecycle over here.

63
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:03,560
So let me call this and let me open the logs and once I open the logs I didn't even do anything yet.

64
00:04:04,020 --> 00:04:04,620
But I.

65
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:06,540
As you can see we did load.

66
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:13,130
We will appear and we did appear cold and you have to pay attention to the order.

67
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,530
First we have the load has been called second.

68
00:04:16,670 --> 00:04:22,170
We will appear and then view did appear so real.

69
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:27,360
Did the load actually gets cold before we see the view.

70
00:04:27,580 --> 00:04:27,890
Okay.

71
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:31,620
Before the user sees the view we did load gets cold.

72
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:40,020
So for example let me go to second view and as you can see we will disappear and we did disappear gets

73
00:04:40,020 --> 00:04:40,890
cold.

74
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:46,380
So right now my first view controller did disappear really.

75
00:04:46,830 --> 00:04:49,230
And now we fight go back.

76
00:04:49,230 --> 00:04:51,580
What do you think will happen.

77
00:04:51,710 --> 00:04:53,340
Will we have did load.

78
00:04:53,370 --> 00:04:55,370
Big cold again.

79
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,920
As you can see we did load is not cold again.

80
00:05:00,040 --> 00:05:05,560
So we will appear and we did appear actually got called a.

81
00:05:06,100 --> 00:05:09,700
So we did load only gets cold Vons.

82
00:05:09,760 --> 00:05:11,570
The app is launched.

83
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:12,390
Okay.

84
00:05:12,430 --> 00:05:21,730
Of your dad if you go to these views without killing this we controller it never gets cold.

85
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:30,640
So if I want something to be happening every time user goes back and forth I cannot use with the load.

86
00:05:30,670 --> 00:05:39,740
Okay so if I want something to be happening when I go back I have to use we will appear or view did

87
00:05:39,770 --> 00:05:41,110
appear.

88
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,430
I cannot use a view that they appear it won't make sense.

89
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:50,710
I can't use VR will appear for example let me write a teal and go to next.

90
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,590
Okay so I'm going into the second screen so we'll did we.

91
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:03,220
Will disappear and we'll do the cold and I go back and I still see the tail and this is default behavior

92
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,220
we expect to see that.

93
00:06:05,260 --> 00:06:09,820
But what if while I want to get rid of this name.

94
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:17,460
What if what I want this name to be empty when I go back can I do that under we did load.

95
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:18,910
So let me try this.

96
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:21,930
Name tags that tax is empty string.

97
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:25,900
So let me run this one more time.

98
00:06:25,900 --> 00:06:29,480
And of course we won't do that right.

99
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,980
Because we did load is cold right now but it won't get cold.

100
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:36,170
OK.

101
00:06:36,220 --> 00:06:40,100
When I go here and go back.

102
00:06:40,780 --> 00:06:50,170
So since we did load isn't cold name Tax that tax is not an empty string anymore so it doesn't work.

103
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:56,010
So we have to know the details of these functions in order to leverage them.

104
00:06:56,050 --> 00:07:02,560
We did load only gets cold once once the application is launched.

105
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:10,090
Now if I do if I want to do something like that I have to do this under V will appear so that it will

106
00:07:10,090 --> 00:07:12,790
be in place before the user sees it.

107
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:15,880
So I'm not doing that under the videotape here.

108
00:07:15,900 --> 00:07:21,640
OK I'm doing it under V will appear so it will be in effect before a user sees it.

109
00:07:21,880 --> 00:07:25,720
And it will get called everytime this view appears.

110
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:36,070
So let me go to a tail and a next and go back and this time as you can see my name tags that text is

111
00:07:36,070 --> 00:07:37,930
actually empty.

112
00:07:38,020 --> 00:07:44,530
So this is how you leverage these functions we're going to see some other examples of that when we build

113
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,560
apps in the following sections.

114
00:07:46,600 --> 00:07:53,350
So I'm going to stop here and we're going to learn about alert messages within the next lecture.
