00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,480
Hi within this lecture regrouping to test our app to see if it's working properly or not.

2
00:00:06,570 --> 00:00:12,630
And regarding to improve our code if we come across with any problem as you can see and I've type left

3
00:00:12,660 --> 00:00:20,310
is twenty three hours because one hour is passed so that we will know when it's going to be deleted

4
00:00:20,310 --> 00:00:20,970
or not.

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:25,340
So let me look out from this and let me create a new user.

6
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:32,670
I'm gonna call this La said Metallica dot com and give a user name like Lars Ori and give a password

7
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:36,360
like One two three four five six and sign this up.

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,350
Once I do that I can see the James Hadfield snaps as well.

9
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,310
So this is looking good.

10
00:00:42,330 --> 00:00:47,800
Let me create my own snap to see if this works or not.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:56,040
So let me choose the Mona Lisa from here and let me try to upload this so once I do that it will take

12
00:00:56,040 --> 00:00:57,200
me to the feed.

13
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,650
And here we see the lights.

14
00:00:58,660 --> 00:01:00,540
All right so that's cool.

15
00:01:00,540 --> 00:01:06,770
Let me open this and we will only see one image and we cannot slide yet.

16
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:09,110
So I believe there is a problem.

17
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:15,330
Maybe you have realized that it's also showed the 23 hours label.

18
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:19,200
So let me try it one more time I'm sure you're going to take care of that later on.

19
00:01:20,220 --> 00:01:21,210
So here we go.

20
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:26,130
Let me open this and now we can slide over here to see the surface.

21
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:32,370
But I believe we have some problem regarding the time label as you can see this is 23 hours on this

22
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:38,440
is correct because in fact we uploaded them one hour ago but we just uploaded.

23
00:01:38,450 --> 00:01:43,320
Lars Ulrich snaps and it still shows 23 hours.

24
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,340
So I believe we have something wrong with our time left function.

25
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:55,860
So let me try to debug this in real time so that you will understand how these things work as well.

26
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,840
So let me come over here to my five year base five star.

27
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:03,150
And let me see if data is correct or not.

28
00:02:03,150 --> 00:02:04,530
So it seems correct.

29
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:10,440
As you can see now the it's 2 o'clock or here and here you go.

30
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:19,290
This is one o'clock and the date value is actually correct in both James and Lars will release documents.

31
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:27,980
So it must be us it must be the code that understands the difference and passes this along to the snap

32
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:28,980
view controller.

33
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:34,350
So if we come to our feet we have controller we have to find this difference.

34
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:34,650
Yep.

35
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:41,620
This one and now I'm going to test to see if we have any issues over here.

36
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:49,380
So now we're checking to see if difference is larger than 24 hours and I'm going to print out the difference

37
00:02:49,380 --> 00:02:54,610
over here to see if we have some different weird values.

38
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:58,890
So let me say something like difference.

39
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,680
OK.

40
00:02:59,850 --> 00:03:07,170
And let me put actually a back slash over here as a difference so that we can filter the results in

41
00:03:07,170 --> 00:03:08,440
our looks.

42
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:16,650
So let me run this from scratch and since it's going to be just executed in the field view controller

43
00:03:16,650 --> 00:03:23,390
we can come over here to our looks and search for a difference to see this difference value.

44
00:03:23,460 --> 00:03:31,470
So let me search for a difference and here you go we have 1 0 and 1 1.

45
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:39,000
So I believe we're doing something really wrong or we're here because we're getting this 1 and 0 and

46
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:40,530
they're actually correct.

47
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:49,260
So it has to be 24 hours in last and it has to be 23 hours in James but we're not saving these values

48
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:55,410
into this specific individual snaps but rather we're just passing this along to snap.

49
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:02,160
We have controller so that we're just using one time difference value for old snaps.

50
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:04,350
So that's not correct.

51
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,920
So let me print out date that date value so that we can see the individual dates as well.

52
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:13,610
Even though we are getting everything right.

53
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:19,920
And even though we're doing every calculation right as you can see we're getting two different values

54
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:28,410
regarding dates even though we're getting these two different values we're just using one value in SNAP.

55
00:04:28,410 --> 00:04:36,150
We have controller and that's why we're failing at this moment in order to overcome this problem.

56
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:44,400
I believe we have to create a new variable inside of our snap model so that we can integrate this time

57
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:50,470
difference to our risk top model as well so that we can use this inside of our model.

58
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:56,290
It will be much more structural and safer than what we already have over here.

59
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:02,490
So I'm going to test this OK because it's not working clearly.

60
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:09,860
And as we move along to the other snaps as we increase the number of users it will get only worse.

61
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:17,970
So let me come over to my snap model and let me create some variable called Time difference or time

62
00:05:17,970 --> 00:05:19,590
left for example.

63
00:05:19,590 --> 00:05:22,090
So this will be an integer.

64
00:05:22,380 --> 00:05:30,210
So once we do that now I can come over to my feed V.C. and before adding my snap to this snap array

65
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:35,150
I can add this value to my snap model as well.

66
00:05:35,430 --> 00:05:37,020
And it doesn't auto complete.

67
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:41,370
So let me delete everything from here and write it from scratch.

68
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:46,760
So when I open parentheses it should ask me for this time left.

69
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,490
Let me delete this and he'd comment B to synchronize everything.

70
00:05:51,570 --> 00:05:54,410
So once I do that when I open this snap Yep.

71
00:05:54,420 --> 00:05:59,710
Now this is asking for a time difference so the user name is the user name.

72
00:05:59,730 --> 00:06:01,050
OK.

73
00:06:01,050 --> 00:06:02,380
Image URL area.

74
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:04,360
Yep this is the same thing.

75
00:06:04,380 --> 00:06:09,570
So date is still date updates value and four time difference.

76
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:12,130
I'm going to go for this.

77
00:06:12,170 --> 00:06:15,640
Twenty four minus difference here as well.

78
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,700
So once we did do that yeah we cannot reach the difference over here.

79
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:29,280
And I believe we can just get our snap creation methods from here and cut this and paste over here so

80
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,050
that we can reach the difference ends.

81
00:06:33,060 --> 00:06:41,250
Now I can add my snap to the snap array and we're not going to use that at all because right now I have

82
00:06:41,640 --> 00:06:45,820
my snap model over here with time difference.

83
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,960
We're not even going to use this anymore so I'm going to delete this and I'm going to delete this as

84
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:52,240
well.

85
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:53,660
We don't need it.

86
00:06:53,760 --> 00:07:02,100
Right and we don't need to get this snap selected time from here as well.

87
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:03,580
I'm going to delete this as well.

88
00:07:03,630 --> 00:07:05,190
And this one.

89
00:07:05,190 --> 00:07:09,250
So we don't need to pass this information using say grace.

90
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:17,310
Now I can get this from here I can just say time label dot text and this will be time left.

91
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:18,470
OK.

92
00:07:18,630 --> 00:07:25,100
And if you open a backslash and parentheses you can just call snap that time difference.

93
00:07:25,170 --> 00:07:31,620
So that's how you get the time difference for individual snaps with different values.

94
00:07:31,890 --> 00:07:35,820
So let me test this and see if this works or not.

95
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,610
And that's how you do real time debugging as well.

96
00:07:40,140 --> 00:07:44,690
So if you come over here now we have 24 hours in class.

97
00:07:44,790 --> 00:07:49,370
If you come over here we have twenty three hours in James.

98
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:50,760
So that's great.

99
00:07:50,760 --> 00:07:56,220
Now we have different time left values for our different snaps.

100
00:07:56,220 --> 00:08:02,940
Now let me come over to my feed we have controller because we make we have to make sure that this works

101
00:08:03,420 --> 00:08:05,130
as in the way we want.

102
00:08:05,130 --> 00:08:08,430
Let's see if we have any more errors over here.

103
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,810
We can't do that in an else statement right.

104
00:08:12,810 --> 00:08:21,990
So for example right now if difference is greater than 24 hours we are deleting these documents and

105
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,500
else we don't want to delete this but just add snap.

106
00:08:26,530 --> 00:08:30,520
Instead of leading this so let me delete all of this.

107
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:32,470
Why did I put this over here.

108
00:08:32,470 --> 00:08:39,730
Because if this is actually more than 24 hours it will get deleted.

109
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:43,810
It will be deleted and I won't need to create this snap.

110
00:08:43,810 --> 00:08:45,160
Right.

111
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:50,260
And we're getting this error and I believe I misspelled owls or something.

112
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:50,560
Yep.

113
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,760
This doesn't refer to the if control that I want.

114
00:08:54,790 --> 00:08:57,460
Just let me cut this and delete this.

115
00:08:57,460 --> 00:09:02,380
So I want to control owls for 24 hours difference.

116
00:09:02,410 --> 00:09:02,700
Yep.

117
00:09:02,710 --> 00:09:10,000
This one so let me test us and see if this still works or not and if this still works I believe we're

118
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:16,060
done building our Snapchat clone because we have all the functionality that we need.

119
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:18,340
Here you go 24 hours.

120
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:24,820
Here it is and in the James we have twenty three hours and we can slide all the images and so on.

121
00:09:25,390 --> 00:09:31,420
Now we made a real good app that you can work on if you want to work with firebase.

122
00:09:31,420 --> 00:09:37,810
We have learned how to work with your URL erase inside of our five your store.

123
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:44,440
We have learnt about consolidating these values and updating these values we have learnt about image

124
00:09:44,440 --> 00:09:45,610
sliders and everything.

125
00:09:46,390 --> 00:09:50,290
However there is still an issue regarding our app for example.

126
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,550
Over here we have the same date for all snaps.

127
00:09:54,550 --> 00:10:00,800
So even though we upload something at the last minute it will get deleted.

128
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:04,890
If our first snap is uploaded 24 hours a go.

129
00:10:04,960 --> 00:10:12,610
And if we update the date then we upload something then the 24 hours a go snaps won't be deleted.

130
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:17,230
So you have to have different dates for each snap as well.

131
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:22,030
If you really want to build a snapchat clone and put it on the App Store.

132
00:10:22,420 --> 00:10:29,290
But since we're just trying to learn and trying to master the firebase I'm not going to go into that.

133
00:10:29,290 --> 00:10:36,700
So right now you can understand how to create some different areas how to unders create some different

134
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:43,150
structures because you have learned so much about fire your base and you have learned so much about

135
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:43,660
Swift.

136
00:10:44,020 --> 00:10:47,230
Then you can work your up way from here.

137
00:10:47,530 --> 00:10:49,600
So I hope you enjoyed this course.

138
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:53,350
Let's stop here and continue within the next section.
