00:00:00,550 --> 00:00:00,990
Hi.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:02,580
We didn't this lecture.

3
00:00:02,580 --> 00:00:07,350
We going to see how to create customized keyboards.

4
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:14,440
So as you know when user taps on a text field in our app they get to see a keyboard.

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:22,110
And this is automatically shown by iPhone itself but we can actually customize this keyboard and we

6
00:00:22,110 --> 00:00:29,790
can create a new keyboard that that can user use and we are going to see how to do that in this lecture

7
00:00:30,270 --> 00:00:31,350
in order to do that.

8
00:00:31,350 --> 00:00:34,250
I'm going to go for irregular single view app.

9
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:34,950
OK.

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,580
Later on we're going to add an extension for a keyboard.

11
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,410
So in here for product name I'm going to go for hardcore keyboard.

12
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:53,640
OK so let's just uncheck all of these like Swift UI core data and maybe you know what what their hardware

13
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,930
is or who Holder is actually if you watch Game of Thrones.

14
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:04,680
So this is a character from the popular TV series Game of Thrones.

15
00:01:04,740 --> 00:01:05,180
OK.

16
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,240
And you're going to see why we're choosing this character in a minute.

17
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:18,210
So let me make this into a full screen and then let me go to my safari to find a holder image.

18
00:01:18,210 --> 00:01:21,110
So let's open safari and let's go to Google.

19
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:22,320
OK.

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,000
And in Google I'm going to go for Ho da.

21
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,940
So this is our character.

22
00:01:26,940 --> 00:01:27,230
OK.

23
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:34,860
This is the hardcore character from Game of Thrones and the special thing about Hodor is that he can

24
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,960
only say ho da so he can only speak the words of Hodor.

25
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:44,660
So we're going to insert this image in our keyboard.

26
00:01:44,790 --> 00:01:50,040
So whenever a user taps on this keyboard it will just write her da.

27
00:01:50,410 --> 00:01:50,780
OK.

28
00:01:51,150 --> 00:01:53,520
So we're going to build this keyboard.

29
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,080
So I'm going to download this image in my downloads folder.

30
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:04,580
You can just choose whatever image you want it doesn't matter as long as it's a PSG or JPEG file.

31
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:05,420
OK.

32
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:10,980
Just select that Holder image and not bring in your project.

33
00:02:10,980 --> 00:02:16,770
Right now we're going to do that later on because we're not going to be working on this we have controller

34
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:19,770
rather we going to add a new extension.

35
00:02:19,770 --> 00:02:22,830
So let me show you how to do that.

36
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:25,750
We were working with Disney new file before.

37
00:02:25,830 --> 00:02:30,570
OK but now we're going to go for new targets in order to do that.

38
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:38,580
Let's just choose this option here just general projects setting so the target will be put in the right

39
00:02:38,580 --> 00:02:39,280
place.

40
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:41,750
So say target from here.

41
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:50,120
If you come over to this tab you will see we have a lot of extensions in here like we have this kid

42
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:51,100
contacts we.

43
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,050
We're going to work with this custom keyboard extension.

44
00:02:54,070 --> 00:03:01,490
OK but if you browse is a little bit you will see a lot of extensions here like I message extension.

45
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:07,320
We have a call directory extension and a notification center.

46
00:03:07,320 --> 00:03:15,240
In fact a secret back extension in fact we going to work some of these later on but we want to start

47
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:17,040
with custom keyboard extension.

48
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:17,570
OK.

49
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:25,110
Because this is a good practice and you have to do a product name to your extension as well like a holder

50
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:30,990
keyboard or hold or make sure your project and application is selected from here.

51
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:38,480
And just say yeah I want to activate this after you do that you will see another folder here called

52
00:03:38,490 --> 00:03:39,070
Hard Art.

53
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,880
So this is the keyboard view controller.

54
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:46,230
So this is where we're going to work on.

55
00:03:46,290 --> 00:03:52,860
So right now I have this hold our keyboard view controller and this defies our keyboard as you can see

56
00:03:53,070 --> 00:03:58,310
hold your extension is now selected to be run on my simulators.

57
00:03:58,410 --> 00:04:04,520
If not you can just choose it from here and choose one of the simulators as well.

58
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:07,620
Make sure the hardware extension is selected.

59
00:04:07,770 --> 00:04:09,120
OK.

60
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:16,470
And in fact before we go on and write some code or just explore those codes I want to run this because

61
00:04:16,470 --> 00:04:23,940
it will ask us an application to run on as you can see it asks us which application do you want to run

62
00:04:23,970 --> 00:04:25,000
this on.

63
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,710
So since we're running a keyboard we have to choose an application that needs a keyboard like massages

64
00:04:31,710 --> 00:04:34,350
or you can just choose whatever you want.

65
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:43,950
Actually I'm going to go with today because after you open this in your simulator it will pop up a screen

66
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:52,200
like this and you can just close it down there in like a regular phone because we have to go to settings

67
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:55,520
in order to make sure our keyboard is selected.

68
00:04:55,530 --> 00:05:02,200
So let me show you what I mean let me run this vids something yeah like messages or Safari.

69
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:03,870
Let's go four so far.

70
00:05:04,310 --> 00:05:10,390
It will bring up the safari but at this moment let's say OK.

71
00:05:10,390 --> 00:05:15,370
And at this moment we cannot see our keyboard.

72
00:05:15,380 --> 00:05:16,550
Let me try.

73
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:24,440
I tap on this keyboard will open and if it doesn't open for you make sure you go here to hardware and

74
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:31,430
go to keyboard and say connect heart rate hardware keyboard or just toggle software keyboard.

75
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:32,640
OK.

76
00:05:32,750 --> 00:05:41,360
And what I'm going to do I'm going to click on the left lower side of this keyboard to change the keyboards

77
00:05:41,660 --> 00:05:48,320
and as you can see we cannot see our custom keyboard here yet we can only see an English keyboard and

78
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,590
I believe at Turkish one is installed here.

79
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:57,040
So I'm going to close this safari and I'm gonna go for general settings over here.

80
00:05:57,380 --> 00:06:02,080
And if I click on keyboard I will see keyboards.

81
00:06:02,180 --> 00:06:05,780
And that's where I can add my newly created keyboard.

82
00:06:06,050 --> 00:06:10,760
So this is not different than adding a new keyboard to your gerund phone.

83
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:15,260
OK so as you can see her door is now in the list.

84
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:24,200
And now if I go back and if I open the Safari or any other application that requires a keyboard if I

85
00:06:24,230 --> 00:06:25,130
click on this.

86
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:26,970
Here you go.

87
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:32,120
And we got a crash but I believe this is just an X code bug.

88
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:42,260
So let me do let me stop this OK and let me do product clean and let me run this one more time with

89
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:44,020
Safari.

90
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:51,130
It should be about because we didn't even write any code here so let's make sure this works.

91
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:57,860
Let's open our simulator it will just being up to safari and it will display a keyboard.

92
00:06:57,860 --> 00:06:58,870
So here you go.

93
00:06:58,870 --> 00:07:04,910
Let me click one more time and this is the custom keyboard that we're working on as you can see there

94
00:07:04,910 --> 00:07:09,920
is nothing in here right now because we haven't written any code yet.

95
00:07:10,970 --> 00:07:17,900
And let me stop this and let me go to keyboard view controller to see what we got here.

96
00:07:17,930 --> 00:07:18,810
So this has.

97
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:25,880
We did load and this is the same we did load that we used to see in here we do what we have to do on

98
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:28,230
this keyboard load up.

99
00:07:28,340 --> 00:07:31,840
So we gonna write our hold our code in here as well.

100
00:07:32,450 --> 00:07:35,410
So let's see what else we got here.

101
00:07:35,550 --> 00:07:39,020
As you can see it creates a new button for us.

102
00:07:39,020 --> 00:07:47,240
So it's named the next key button and it should have popped up in our custom keyboard.

103
00:07:47,300 --> 00:07:50,240
So let me check it one more time.

104
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:56,300
Even though we see the custom keyboard over here we don't see anything as a next keyboard but this world

105
00:07:56,300 --> 00:07:57,560
icon does the same thing.

106
00:07:57,560 --> 00:07:59,470
It lets us to the next keyboard.

107
00:07:59,480 --> 00:08:03,210
So I believe we don't have any problem right now.

108
00:08:03,590 --> 00:08:09,680
And we're going to create our own buttons so we will see if we have any problem displaying any views

109
00:08:10,100 --> 00:08:10,790
at all.

110
00:08:11,570 --> 00:08:18,950
So in here we have a tax will change and it indicates a user's typing or not so text will change.

111
00:08:18,950 --> 00:08:21,230
And this is text did change.

112
00:08:21,350 --> 00:08:26,810
It actually lets us understand if text has been changed.

113
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:32,410
And as you can see we're doing this change to a proxy here called text document proxy.

114
00:08:32,480 --> 00:08:39,320
And in fact that is what we were going to use to insert the holder text in the tapped place.

115
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:39,680
OK.

116
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:41,120
I'm going to show you have to do that.

117
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:41,810
Don't worry.

118
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:47,850
So let me write this header so we can understand what we're trying to do.

119
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:54,110
So I'm going to create my whole door button and this is exactly the same way that we have done before

120
00:08:54,350 --> 00:08:55,520
in the layout section.

121
00:08:55,550 --> 00:09:01,470
So it's going to ask that type if I hit enter and Dot I can just go for system.

122
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:03,000
OK.

123
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:09,320
And after the system bottom this is actually a button it's not a fancy thing.

124
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:12,510
So I have to give a frame.

125
00:09:12,590 --> 00:09:18,980
Remember we have to specify very very it is going to be located what lead in height.

126
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:19,930
It's going to have.

127
00:09:19,930 --> 00:09:25,050
So you have to just come over here order button dot frame.

128
00:09:25,130 --> 00:09:28,290
It will ask you to create a your erect.

129
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:36,670
Remember Open parentheses and you have to come here to choose X Y with height.

130
00:09:36,710 --> 00:09:42,240
So this is the x axis of the keyboards and y axis of the keyword.

131
00:09:42,290 --> 00:09:43,310
Okay.

132
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:49,330
And I'm just going to go for some regular numbers like 100 100.

133
00:09:49,370 --> 00:09:53,750
We can always come back and choose a better one here.

134
00:09:53,750 --> 00:09:58,740
So like like an example I'm going to go for one hundred and fifty.

135
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,030
OK and for why.

136
00:10:01,320 --> 00:10:02,380
Yeah I couldn't write it.

137
00:10:02,380 --> 00:10:10,990
One hundred and fifty for why I'm gonna go for 50 let's say 100 to 100 for we then height as well.

138
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:18,020
So let me choose these numbers right now because I don't know how it's going to show up later on.

139
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:28,130
I'm gonna go over here and change this is I want so next thing will be the deep but in the background

140
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:29,560
image of this button.

141
00:10:29,570 --> 00:10:30,060
Okay.

142
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:37,990
So if you choose harder button that background image or setback ground image you can set the holder

143
00:10:37,990 --> 00:10:41,170
J pack that we have downloaded from the Internet.

144
00:10:41,180 --> 00:10:45,370
So it asks for a UI image as you can see.

145
00:10:45,530 --> 00:10:54,170
So all you have to do is just come here and take this whole DRP Angie in our Holder folder.

146
00:10:54,170 --> 00:10:58,670
So I'm not placing this under our Holder keyboard app.

147
00:10:58,670 --> 00:11:01,280
I'm just placing this under my extension.

148
00:11:01,430 --> 00:11:01,960
OK.

149
00:11:02,030 --> 00:11:06,480
Make sure you put this in your extension not in your app.

150
00:11:06,530 --> 00:11:12,190
So after that you can come over here and say you I image named OK.

151
00:11:12,200 --> 00:11:16,380
And the name will be HUD or dot BMG.

152
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:23,280
So far states just hit enter and you can just go for normal here.

153
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:30,920
So the next thing will be is to tell HUD or button to what we want to do with the holder button.

154
00:11:30,920 --> 00:11:31,310
Right.

155
00:11:31,640 --> 00:11:37,910
So whenever a user taps on the holder button I actually want to display a text.

156
00:11:38,660 --> 00:11:42,410
So I'm gonna go for at Target as you might remember.

157
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:42,830
Right.

158
00:11:42,830 --> 00:11:48,040
So that's what we do when we try to add an action to our bottom.

159
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:56,750
So it's going to take it from the south as usual and the action will be a select their function as usual.

160
00:11:56,750 --> 00:11:57,750
OK.

161
00:11:57,770 --> 00:12:02,960
And this event will be touch up inside the event as you might remember.

162
00:12:02,960 --> 00:12:08,950
So when a user types up inside meaning that taps on the button it will get called.

163
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,610
So touch up inside.

164
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:12,340
OK.

165
00:12:12,860 --> 00:12:13,980
So this is it.

166
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,420
Of course we have to create a new function over here.

167
00:12:17,450 --> 00:12:19,670
So this is going to be our button tap.

168
00:12:19,670 --> 00:12:24,290
So I'm going to call this keyboard or HUD or tap tapped.

169
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:30,560
OK hold or tapped so open close parentheses and open curly braces.

170
00:12:30,650 --> 00:12:36,870
Right now I'm just going to go for HUD are tapped and we will see if this works or not.

171
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:41,810
So for selector I'm going to go for HUD or tapped as well.

172
00:12:41,810 --> 00:12:45,500
And finally we have to add this to a review.

173
00:12:45,500 --> 00:12:53,330
So let's go for we at DOD at sub view and the view that we want to add is the holder button itself.

174
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,350
So here you go we have created our Holder button image.

175
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:04,370
So let's go first how far you one more time and let's see if we can see how hot our image in our customized

176
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:05,300
keyboard.

177
00:13:05,390 --> 00:13:06,950
So let's change.

178
00:13:06,950 --> 00:13:09,560
And here you go the holder appeared.

179
00:13:10,100 --> 00:13:16,770
So I believe this is not in an ideal size like we have to increase the with a little bit okay or 100

180
00:13:16,820 --> 00:13:20,240
is obviously small for this.

181
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:24,500
And as you can see when I tap on the holder it says that Holder tap.

182
00:13:24,500 --> 00:13:25,430
So it's working.

183
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:26,690
Very good.

184
00:13:26,690 --> 00:13:30,330
We have to add a text here rather than printing out.

185
00:13:30,330 --> 00:13:32,090
We're going to see how to do that.

186
00:13:32,090 --> 00:13:37,180
But first let me choose this for like 120 or 140.

187
00:13:37,280 --> 00:13:37,630
OK.

188
00:13:37,640 --> 00:13:43,120
You can play with these numbers as I said before to find your optimal height and weight.

189
00:13:43,430 --> 00:13:48,350
And in the print function I'm going to delete does in the Holder tapped function.

190
00:13:48,350 --> 00:13:57,050
What I want to do is to create a proxy and add this text to wherever user tapped before.

191
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,430
So in order to do that you have to say text document proxy.

192
00:14:02,210 --> 00:14:09,680
So as you can see this is an object that custom keyword is interacting to insert text.

193
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:10,520
OK.

194
00:14:10,580 --> 00:14:15,990
So we you going to use this text document proxy and you can call this whatever you want.

195
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:18,780
I'm going to call these tax proxy.

196
00:14:18,810 --> 00:14:24,290
After that you have to make sure you cast this to be a you.

197
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:29,820
I you I text proxy tax document proxy.

198
00:14:29,850 --> 00:14:30,710
This one.

199
00:14:30,840 --> 00:14:36,050
So you have to cast is as you a tax document proxy.

200
00:14:36,090 --> 00:14:39,090
After that you can search your tax here.

201
00:14:39,180 --> 00:14:41,650
All you have to do is just say tax proxy.

202
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:45,570
That is are taxed and just choose whatever you want.

203
00:14:45,870 --> 00:14:51,400
So in our case we were going to say hold with capitalized letters of course.

204
00:14:51,420 --> 00:14:57,930
So let me run this one more time and see if we managed to create a customized keyboard.

205
00:14:58,620 --> 00:14:59,730
So here you go.

206
00:14:59,730 --> 00:15:08,900
Let's tap on here to write something and let's find our customized keyboard by clicking over here.

207
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:09,990
And here you go.

208
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:11,610
We see the DA.

209
00:15:11,730 --> 00:15:12,100
Yeah.

210
00:15:12,270 --> 00:15:16,410
And the width is better right now as you can see it's perfect.

211
00:15:16,410 --> 00:15:21,270
What I wanted actually say if I tap on this as you can see it's right so.

212
00:15:21,690 --> 00:15:24,420
So I can tap as many as I want.

213
00:15:24,450 --> 00:15:26,120
And it's with the right holder.

214
00:15:26,130 --> 00:15:29,070
As many as we want.

215
00:15:29,070 --> 00:15:33,810
So that's how you create customized keyboard for your apps.

216
00:15:33,930 --> 00:15:41,730
And of course you can work with a lot of different images or a lot of different ladders in here to create

217
00:15:41,730 --> 00:15:48,850
your own custom keyboards and you can make it right whatever you want then user clicks on that.

218
00:15:49,230 --> 00:15:56,970
All you had to do is just create and you win here like this and add this sub view to your original view

219
00:15:57,300 --> 00:15:59,520
and even the selector function.

220
00:15:59,520 --> 00:16:02,610
You can just write whatever you want.

221
00:16:02,700 --> 00:16:06,310
So that's how we create customized keyboards.

222
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:11,460
So let's stop here and within the next lecture we're going to see how to do sticker packs.
