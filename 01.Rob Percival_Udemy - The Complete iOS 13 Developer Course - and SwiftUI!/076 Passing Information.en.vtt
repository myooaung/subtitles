00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:01.070
Hi.

2
00:00:01.330 --> 00:00:02.770
We didn't this lecture.

3
00:00:02.780 --> 00:00:08.820
Where are you going to finish our app by passing this information to our imagery controller so we can

4
00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:14.220
show the image and the name of this selected landmark to our user.

5
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:14.990
OK.

6
00:00:15.030 --> 00:00:17.880
And in fact we know how to do that right.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:24.300
We have seen how to pass information using safe ways within the previous lectures.

8
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:31.890
So in order to do that I'm going to create two variables in here and I'm going to a sign that those

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.620
variables to my landmark label tags an Image view image.

10
00:00:37.620 --> 00:00:43.340
So let's come over here under our class but outside so far with the load.

11
00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:51.920
So I'm going to call first one is landmark name or chosen landmark name or selected landmark name.

12
00:00:51.930 --> 00:01:00.270
Okay so this will be a string but empty string initially and I'm going to create a selected landmark

13
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.140
image as well.

14
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.390
This will be a UI image but this will be an empty image.

15
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:09.850
I'm not going to assign any value to that.

16
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:16.430
So under with the load I can just go forward and say landmark labeled that tax is actually selected

17
00:01:16.430 --> 00:01:17.300
the landmark name.

18
00:01:17.700 --> 00:01:18.390
OK.

19
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:29.600
And selected or landmark Image view actually Image view that image is the selected landmark image so

20
00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:38.450
this will get the landmark name and the image from the other view controller and display those values

21
00:01:38.510 --> 00:01:41.040
in our views.

22
00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:43.830
So how do we pass that information.

23
00:01:43.940 --> 00:01:48.930
Maybe you remember the function prepare for its Segway.

24
00:01:49.070 --> 00:01:49.670
Right.

25
00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:59.000
That is one of the last things that will happen when we commit for a Segway so that we can a sign our

26
00:01:59.270 --> 00:02:08.030
second view controller our image view controller is a variable and then we can reach the variables inside

27
00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:15.170
of that second view controller and we can change those variables in a way that we want.

28
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:23.360
So before we do this performs a great thing we have to find the selected row.

29
00:02:23.360 --> 00:02:27.250
We have to get this from the index path.

30
00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:27.930
OK.

31
00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:35.180
And we have to assign those values to some variables so that we can use those same variables within

32
00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.790
prepay for Segway function.

33
00:02:37.790 --> 00:02:45.110
So I'm going to create that chosen landmark name K. I'm going to make this equal to Landmark names index

34
00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:45.920
path out throw.

35
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:51.320
So if a user taps on this coliseum it will be landmark named 0.

36
00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:55.190
And my chosen landmark name variable will be coalesce.

37
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.420
OK.

38
00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.180
And I'm going to do the same thing for image as well.

39
00:02:59.180 --> 00:03:07.010
So I'm going to go for chosen landmark image and this will be landmark images index path.

40
00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:16.310
That's your oh so right now this landmark name a landmark image is giving me the chosen landmark name

41
00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:19.850
and landmark image with the help of index.

42
00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:24.320
So for example if I choose Colosseum it will be index 0.

43
00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:27.450
I will get calls from JP and coalesce you mate.

44
00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:37.940
So next thing is to pass this information using prepare for Skagway as I explained before if any reason

45
00:03:37.940 --> 00:03:45.170
you missed the previous sections I suggest you go back and watch them because we have seen this prepared

46
00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:53.620
for say Grand other some advanced U.S. features within the previous sections.

47
00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:57.410
So let's call this prepare for Segway in here.

48
00:03:57.410 --> 00:03:57.770
OK.

49
00:03:57.770 --> 00:04:04.040
In order to do that you can just write prepare and you will see this for Segway function.

50
00:04:04.370 --> 00:04:07.650
And this is not even related to table views OK.

51
00:04:07.670 --> 00:04:13.420
This is not related to any delegate we can just use this in any view controller we want because we're

52
00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:20.570
doing a Segway here we're just passing information from while we controller to another and we can use

53
00:04:20.570 --> 00:04:28.550
this Segway variable that is given to us within this function and we can control does identify you're

54
00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:29.140
right.

55
00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:36.440
We can just say if Segway that identifier is actually to image wheel controller then we're going to

56
00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:37.970
do some things.

57
00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:47.360
So let's open our curly braces and what we want to do is to make sure that this identifier is actually

58
00:04:47.930 --> 00:04:51.650
the same as we have defined before.

59
00:04:51.710 --> 00:04:53.110
If they do not match.

60
00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.800
This won't work.

61
00:04:54.800 --> 00:04:58.070
So make sure you're writing this in the right way.

62
00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.290
OK.

63
00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:07.670
So if say go ahead that identifier is exactly the way we defined before then what we want to do we want

64
00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:12.440
to define our image view controller as a variable in here.

65
00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.100
Right.

66
00:05:13.130 --> 00:05:15.260
I remember how we can do that.

67
00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:23.690
We can just say let destination we see which stands for we controller Let's segway dot destination K

68
00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:25.550
Segway dot.

69
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:33.190
So this gives me you I storyboard Segway and the destination will give me a UI wheel controller and

70
00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:41.230
I'm certain that this will be my image view controllers so I'm going to first cast this as image view

71
00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:42.160
controller.

72
00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:51.020
OK so I can use this because I know my Segway identifier is to image view controller and this will lend

73
00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:53.950
me in image view controller file.

74
00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:54.930
OK.

75
00:05:55.100 --> 00:06:02.700
So now I can use this destination we see to reach imagery controllers variables.

76
00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:10.130
Once you do that I suggest you do a comment be to build and synchronize everything inside of your project.

77
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:18.530
Or maybe you can not see these images these are variables inside of this destination we see if you can't

78
00:06:18.530 --> 00:06:19.250
see them.

79
00:06:19.250 --> 00:06:20.970
There is no problem.

80
00:06:20.990 --> 00:06:22.190
Go ahead.

81
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:29.450
So if you say destination we see that selected landmark names or destination we see like the landmark

82
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:33.030
image then we can change them now.

83
00:06:33.110 --> 00:06:34.670
Right.

84
00:06:34.670 --> 00:06:41.990
So what do we want a sign here we want to a sign chosen landmark name and chosen landmark.

85
00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:50.180
Imagine here but I cannot do that right now because I have defined and initialized these variables inside

86
00:06:50.180 --> 00:06:52.280
another function.

87
00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:59.200
So best course of action here is to delete this and do this inside of my class.

88
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:02.120
But outside of all the functions right.

89
00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:07.850
So I'm going to come up here and I'm going to say selected landmark name.

90
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:14.900
Okay so this will be an empty string initially and selected landmark image.

91
00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.220
Then this will be a I image.

92
00:07:17.330 --> 00:07:20.430
And this is an empty image initially as well.

93
00:07:21.050 --> 00:07:23.280
So let's go for here.

94
00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.750
And this was chosen landmark names.

95
00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:30.710
So let me just delete this on the right chosen.

96
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.390
And in fact it doesn't matter.

97
00:07:32.390 --> 00:07:39.460
But I just want to avoid any confusion because we have named other was as selected as well.

98
00:07:39.530 --> 00:07:42.440
So this will be chosen a landmark name.

99
00:07:42.440 --> 00:07:44.910
And this will be chosen landmark image.

100
00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:46.180
OK.

101
00:07:46.430 --> 00:07:54.380
And now I can come down here and I can say destination we see Dot selected landmark name is actually

102
00:07:54.380 --> 00:08:03.920
chosen landmark name and destination we see selected landmark image is actually chosen landmark image.

103
00:08:03.920 --> 00:08:11.560
So it means that we're getting the chosen landmark image name and image view itself and we're assigning

104
00:08:11.570 --> 00:08:17.390
them in the second view controller so that we can show them to the user.

105
00:08:18.140 --> 00:08:20.530
So let's see Colosseum.

106
00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:21.380
Here we go.

107
00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:22.090
Colosseum.

108
00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:28.880
Let's try each one of those landmarks so we can see Kremlin Stonehenge.

109
00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:30.620
And let's go for Taj Mahal.

110
00:08:31.370 --> 00:08:32.630
So that's perfect.

111
00:08:32.630 --> 00:08:35.950
That's what we want to do in the first place.

112
00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:43.070
So again this is a basic application but this gives us a great template to work a bomb.

113
00:08:43.070 --> 00:08:50.240
So right now you can add whatever you want here you can add a long description you can add the map later

114
00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.090
on you're going to see how to do that you can add the country you can add whatever you want you can

115
00:08:56.090 --> 00:08:59.490
build a good app with this template.

116
00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:01.030
OK.

117
00:09:01.190 --> 00:09:08.210
And last but not least I'm just going to show you how to add a navigation bar title so that you can

118
00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:12.050
have a title in your app in order to do that.

119
00:09:12.110 --> 00:09:17.770
Let's go to we did load of our real controller and just say navigation item.

120
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:26.930
OK dot if you can just say title here and you can choose whatever title we want so that you will have

121
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:29.610
this title in your own app.

122
00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:32.990
So let's run this and you will see what I mean.

123
00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:36.990
As you can see we see the landmark booking here.

124
00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:43.880
So this is a little bit better looking and it gets to your back button as well so back button these

125
00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.390
called landmark book now.

126
00:09:46.550 --> 00:09:49.300
So I hope you enjoyed this section.

127
00:09:49.310 --> 00:09:56.660
We we're going to stop here and within the next section we're going to go ahead and learn intermediate

128
00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:57.980
swift concepts.
