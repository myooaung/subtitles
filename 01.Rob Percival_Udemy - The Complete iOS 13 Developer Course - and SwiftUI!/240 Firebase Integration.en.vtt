00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:08.030
High within those lecture regrowing to create our X code project and we are going to bring in the fire

2
00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.530
base as the case.

3
00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:16.800
Are you going to set our fire based dashboard up so that we will be ready to start writing our Snapchat

4
00:00:16.830 --> 00:00:17.220
clone.

5
00:00:17.620 --> 00:00:21.540
And you know how to do all of this things so I'm gonna be fast.

6
00:00:21.540 --> 00:00:26.220
So create a new project and choose single view app from here.

7
00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.340
And I'm going to call the Snapchat clone.

8
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.600
And of course we're going to use swift and we don't need anything else.

9
00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:39.870
So let me click on Next and create this under my AOS complete folder.

10
00:00:39.870 --> 00:00:45.510
So once we do that in fact we're not going to do anything more over here.

11
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:54.240
We're just going to create our fire base project so that we can bring in the fire firebase SD case later

12
00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:57.870
on of course we going to work on our user interface.

13
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.890
But right now I just want to create my fire race project.

14
00:01:01.890 --> 00:01:08.010
So let me go to my castle in fire your base and just add a new project.

15
00:01:08.010 --> 00:01:13.590
And once again if you haven't bought the Instagram section please go back and watch it because it's

16
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:15.210
gonna be fast.

17
00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:21.850
So I'm going to say this is a snapchat clone and I don't need any Google Analytics right now.

18
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.720
And let me create my projects.

19
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:31.830
So this will create my project and of course I'm going to go come over this X gold project and bring

20
00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:33.680
in the SDK case.

21
00:01:33.720 --> 00:01:39.900
So I believe we have to close this down because we're going to initialize the pod file and then we're

22
00:01:39.900 --> 00:01:42.530
going to install the parts.

23
00:01:42.570 --> 00:01:46.530
So let me add a U.S. project over here.

24
00:01:46.530 --> 00:01:47.850
Okay.

25
00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:54.810
And yeah we need the bundle I.D. So let me open it one more time because I'm going to copy the bundle

26
00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.730
I.D. from the general settings of our projects.

27
00:01:58.740 --> 00:02:00.030
Yep that's the one.

28
00:02:00.030 --> 00:02:07.260
So let me copy this and go back to my IRS bundle idea and let's call this Snapchat clone.

29
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:16.290
And let me registered his app later on it will create a configuration file for me which I will download

30
00:02:16.320 --> 00:02:23.970
and just place it on my ex called Project and previously I have some in my downloads folder so I'm going

31
00:02:23.970 --> 00:02:32.730
to delete this and I'm going to download it OK and I'm going to bring this into my ex code project.

32
00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:39.240
So let me do that and this is the third time I'm opening this project so I wish I hadn't closed it down

33
00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:40.380
in the beginning.

34
00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:45.920
So let me bring this in and let me make sure that copy items if needed.

35
00:02:45.930 --> 00:02:54.300
And this Snapchat clone is chosen once I do that now I'm finally ready to close this down because we're

36
00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.060
going to bring in the SDK case.

37
00:02:57.060 --> 00:03:03.240
So let me open the gate but we're not going to use the guide anymore because we already know how to

38
00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:05.580
import everything right.

39
00:03:05.580 --> 00:03:13.230
So step on create projects step to create this firebase dashboard and everything we did all of that

40
00:03:13.760 --> 00:03:19.570
is this time to initialize our pod file and bring in the necessary parts.

41
00:03:19.590 --> 00:03:21.130
So let me do that.

42
00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:27.570
In fact let me close this down for right now because we don't need our simulator at this point.

43
00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:36.810
So let me open my terminal and in the terminal I'm going to go into my project folder by running change

44
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:44.040
directory comments and then initialize the pod file and then edit the pulled file to bring in the fire

45
00:03:44.060 --> 00:03:45.790
base as the case.

46
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:49.260
So I'm going to go into download and Io is complete.

47
00:03:49.260 --> 00:03:54.200
So you have to go wherever you saved it as before.

48
00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:56.750
So I'm going to going to Snapchat clone.

49
00:03:56.940 --> 00:04:04.320
And as you can see if I say a less I will see the files on folder and then I'm going to create my pod

50
00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:05.640
file.

51
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:12.750
Then let me go to Snapchat clone to pull the file and open this it's text editor.

52
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:20.220
Once we do that we can come over here and say zoom in to see it better and under these use frameworks

53
00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:25.360
I'm going to have to bring in the firebase as the case firebase parts.

54
00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:26.700
So that's what we need.

55
00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:29.450
Let me copy all of this from here.

56
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:31.800
And in fact we're going to need more.

57
00:04:31.890 --> 00:04:34.280
So let me bring them in.

58
00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:41.670
And in real life examples of course you're going to have to check the latest names for the pods as well.

59
00:04:41.670 --> 00:04:46.950
But right now I know this is analytics off file your star.

60
00:04:46.980 --> 00:04:52.290
And on top of that I'm going to need car and storage as well.

61
00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:56.940
So this is car and this is storage.

62
00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:05.530
So again you may want to check to see the real names about they haven't been changing it for like two

63
00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:07.210
or three years I believe.

64
00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:11.450
So I don't think they will change it in the real future.

65
00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:14.650
So I believe we're good to go with these names.

66
00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:19.250
So let me save this and let me close this down.

67
00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:26.110
And now we have to round party install to install a Repub on our projects.

68
00:05:26.140 --> 00:05:31.540
So here you go it's already installing and as you can see they're all shown in green.

69
00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:38.500
Which means that their newly installed and they are all in this latest version I believe.

70
00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:43.330
So now we are ready to use our work space project.

71
00:05:43.330 --> 00:05:47.380
So make sure you choose the workspace rather than X scope project.

72
00:05:47.890 --> 00:05:58.930
Once you do that it will be it will take some time to index all this project files because we now have

73
00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:06.790
a lot of Firebase files a lot of pots that we have brought into our project and we have to wait until

74
00:06:06.790 --> 00:06:08.230
it's indexed.

75
00:06:08.230 --> 00:06:18.430
So let me come over here and as you can see we have to say firebase app that configure in the app delegates.

76
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:25.510
So let me go back to my projects and it's still indexing but let me see if I can import defy your base

77
00:06:25.960 --> 00:06:27.850
and let's say in parts file your base.

78
00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:29.230
Yep it works.

79
00:06:29.230 --> 00:06:36.480
So under did finish launching with options we're going to call fire base app.

80
00:06:36.510 --> 00:06:36.800
Yeah.

81
00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:44.960
This firebase app that configure and this will configure my app so that I can use fi your base.

82
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:48.370
So while we wait it to be completed.

83
00:06:48.430 --> 00:06:55.600
Let me go back to my five year basic dashboard so that we can initialize every module that we need in

84
00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:57.220
this section.

85
00:06:57.220 --> 00:07:00.190
So let me go back to here.

86
00:07:00.220 --> 00:07:02.590
So let's start with authentication.

87
00:07:02.710 --> 00:07:08.440
Even though we're going to get the user names I work with the user names I have to enable this email

88
00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:14.360
and password thing because we're going to create our users with email and password anyway.

89
00:07:14.380 --> 00:07:14.820
OK.

90
00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:20.020
So let me say this is enabled and let's go to our database.

91
00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:22.420
I'm going to initialize our five star.

92
00:07:22.420 --> 00:07:24.630
So let me say create database.

93
00:07:24.690 --> 00:07:31.870
I am going to start in test mode and this will ask me to choose a data center.

94
00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:36.190
And as I explained before you cannot change this after works.

95
00:07:36.220 --> 00:07:40.750
So if you're building for release make sure you select a good one.

96
00:07:40.810 --> 00:07:46.650
Like if you're targeting only us you can select us if you're targeting only Europe.

97
00:07:46.690 --> 00:07:51.660
You can just select Europe because you cannot change it later on.

98
00:07:51.670 --> 00:07:58.000
So once you do that you will create your file your store and you will be ready to work with far your

99
00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.650
store modules.

100
00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.800
So here you go it's still indexing.

101
00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:03.900
Let me go back.

102
00:08:03.940 --> 00:08:09.910
And once it's finishes I'm going to go to storage and initialize storage as well.

103
00:08:10.390 --> 00:08:13.420
So let me go here and say get started.

104
00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:17.050
So it asks us for default security rules.

105
00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:17.480
Yep.

106
00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:19.300
If authentication is not null.

107
00:08:19.510 --> 00:08:25.160
It's good to go so I'm going to say next and it will ask me the data.

108
00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:28.300
Place one more time even though we cannot change it now.

109
00:08:28.990 --> 00:08:33.620
So I'm going to say dumb and it will create my storage as well.

110
00:08:33.640 --> 00:08:40.000
Now we have initialized everything in the file your base that we are going to work with and we have

111
00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.400
brought in the SD case once it finishes indexing.

112
00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:45.780
We are good to go.

113
00:08:45.830 --> 00:08:47.710
Let's do that in the next lecture.
