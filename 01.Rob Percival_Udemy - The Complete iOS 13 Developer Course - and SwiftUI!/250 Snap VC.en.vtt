00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:08.280
Hi we this lecture we're going to get the SD web image in order to show our images inside of our table

2
00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:08.630
view.

3
00:00:09.180 --> 00:00:16.180
So now we have the image urls but we need some tool to display them in our table view.

4
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.810
And remember we have used this SD web image in the Instagram clone section.

5
00:00:21.810 --> 00:00:23.670
Now we're going to use this as well.

6
00:00:23.670 --> 00:00:30.830
Of course if you have another favorite image downloader to you you're more than welcome to use it.

7
00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:36.150
But I'm going to go for as SD web image so remember how this is used.

8
00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:40.390
You just import this as the web image and you can just say as these sets.

9
00:00:40.410 --> 00:00:47.850
Image but in order to do that of course we're going to have to adjust our pulled file so that we can

10
00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.050
download this part as well.

11
00:00:50.070 --> 00:00:51.710
So let me copy this.

12
00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:58.350
And in order to open the pod file you can come over here and choose the path file so you can just paste

13
00:00:58.350 --> 00:00:59.910
whatever you want.

14
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:06.090
And of course after that you have to save and close doors down because we going to go into our terminal

15
00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:09.130
and round potting soil anyway.

16
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:09.480
OK.

17
00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.010
So let me make this a little bit bigger.

18
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:18.140
And that's not the last pod that we're going to use in this section unfortunately.

19
00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:25.010
So let me go into downloads and let me go and tell you what's complete and then Snapchat clone.

20
00:01:25.230 --> 00:01:31.140
And now I can just around Polly install because I have already edited my portfolio.

21
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.040
So here we go it's installing only the SD web image.

22
00:01:35.040 --> 00:01:38.910
The other ones are already installed in my project.

23
00:01:38.910 --> 00:01:44.520
So after this completes I can just go over to my project and start using it.

24
00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:45.590
So here you go.

25
00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:48.880
Let me open Snapchat clone one more time.

26
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.230
So now we are the I believe we're going to have a little with indexing over here since we have brought

27
00:01:55.260 --> 00:01:56.620
in one part.

28
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:05.970
But right now I can just try to access DSD web image in my feed we see by the way we're going to have

29
00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:12.440
to decide which image you're out to show in this feed Image view because we're going to have an image

30
00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:13.230
here Larry.

31
00:02:13.260 --> 00:02:22.460
But in here we're only displaying one image so you can just choose to display the first or the last.

32
00:02:23.520 --> 00:02:27.240
So let's come over here to feed Image view.

33
00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.100
OK.

34
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:31.060
And you can just call as the set image.

35
00:02:31.170 --> 00:02:35.950
And of course in order to do that you're going to have to import the SD web image.

36
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:43.340
So once you all import DSD web image you can come over here and say SD has image.

37
00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.330
So we want to set this image with your URL and we don't need completion blocks.

38
00:02:48.330 --> 00:02:54.800
So over here you're going to you're going to have to call your owl and this will ask you for a string.

39
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:04.170
So we're going to get this drink from our snap array because we have this in our snap model right.

40
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.420
So you can just call snap array index path that throw.

41
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:12.660
And after that you can just say dot image here Larry.

42
00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:19.830
And as you can see this gives you an array and you can go for the first element if you want if you want.

43
00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:25.140
You can go for dots last to get the last element to display over here.

44
00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:31.440
So this is your choice whether you want to show the first snap of the user in the feed or your less

45
00:03:31.530 --> 00:03:33.310
or users last snap.

46
00:03:34.260 --> 00:03:37.140
So that's it for showing the feed.

47
00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:44.970
OK so let me run this and see if we can get the first snaps displaying in our feed we've controller.

48
00:03:45.270 --> 00:03:45.630
OK.

49
00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.210
So let's see.

50
00:03:48.800 --> 00:03:58.060
In the feed we controller we expect to see the James first snap and it's taking a little bit of time.

51
00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:00.790
And anyway we don't see it at all.

52
00:04:00.830 --> 00:04:04.200
As you can see I believe we have some kind of error.

53
00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:12.560
So let me go back to our function where we download data from your base and as you can see we didn't

54
00:04:12.590 --> 00:04:17.510
even call table view dot reload data after this for loop.

55
00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:23.520
Remember we have to do that in order to show the data inside of our table view.

56
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:29.330
Right now we are just getting the data about we are not refreshing our table view so that we would see

57
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.440
that data.

58
00:04:30.890 --> 00:04:32.750
So let me run it one more time.

59
00:04:32.750 --> 00:04:36.890
Hopefully we're going to see the first snap of the James this time.

60
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:40.050
As you can see now we have this.

61
00:04:40.070 --> 00:04:41.480
So that's good.

62
00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:50.090
So now what I want to do is to click over here to open our snap me controller in a pop over we see em

63
00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:55.430
in here we're going to display all the images in a slide imager.

64
00:04:55.430 --> 00:04:56.130
Okay.

65
00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:57.500
So let's do that.

66
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:03.920
Let's actually bring in the prepared for Segway and bring in the.

67
00:05:04.100 --> 00:05:11.270
Did select grow in order to do the Segway and just pass this time left information to snap.

68
00:05:11.270 --> 00:05:12.740
We have controller.

69
00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:16.790
So let's see if we have this Segway already.

70
00:05:16.790 --> 00:05:19.300
I have forgotten about it yet.

71
00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.930
We have this and let's see.

72
00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:21.230
Yeah.

73
00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:23.690
It's cold to snap we see.

74
00:05:23.690 --> 00:05:26.540
So let's come over here to our feet.

75
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:27.630
We have controller.

76
00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:28.210
OK.

77
00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:36.550
And then user taps one off the table view items we're going to get this data and pass this to SAP.

78
00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:40.250
We have controller and we're going to do a Segway Of course.

79
00:05:40.310 --> 00:05:50.000
So I'm going to create an variable in order to get this chosen snap and get this time left data in order

80
00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.520
to pass them to the snap V.C..

81
00:05:53.660 --> 00:05:56.170
So I'm going to call this chosen snap.

82
00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:56.950
OK.

83
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:05.540
And this will be an optional snap and I'm going to call time left and this will be optional integer.

84
00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:14.930
So we're going to assign the chosen snap depending on very user clicked but for Time Lapse we can come

85
00:06:14.930 --> 00:06:21.410
over here we can just say s dot Time left is twenty four hours minus difference.

86
00:06:21.410 --> 00:06:22.080
OK.

87
00:06:22.250 --> 00:06:30.480
So if the difference is two hours then we will have twenty two hours left to delete the snaps.

88
00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:34.910
So we're going to just pass this information to snap.

89
00:06:34.910 --> 00:06:38.210
We have controller using our prepare for Segway.

90
00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:39.500
Right.

91
00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:45.380
So let's come over here and say prepare for Segway.

92
00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:47.410
So this is the first one.

93
00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:49.940
And of course we're going to have to bring in.

94
00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:59.330
Did select grow as VO So we're going to get these selected index over here first of all let me do my

95
00:06:59.330 --> 00:07:04.030
Segway so this will be to snap ABC and send there will be no.

96
00:07:04.190 --> 00:07:12.710
But before doing my Segway I'm going to assign my choose and snap to be snuffed out snap or a index

97
00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:20.630
path they'll throw so that I will know what my chosen SNAP is so that I can pass this information to

98
00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:22.480
my snap V.C..

99
00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:28.800
So over here I'm going to say a Segway that identifier is indeed to snap V.C..

100
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.440
Then I'm going to create my snap.

101
00:07:31.440 --> 00:07:33.750
This is a variable over here.

102
00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.580
So this will be destination we have controller.

103
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:37.340
OK.

104
00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.550
And I'm going to call this Segway that destination.

105
00:07:40.570 --> 00:07:47.580
I'm going to cast as snap ABC and then later on I'm going to say.

106
00:07:47.990 --> 00:07:53.290
Destination we see Dot variable name and we need a variable over here.

107
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.920
So I'm going to call this selected snap.

108
00:07:56.120 --> 00:08:05.030
Ok so this will be a type of SNAP optional and I'm going to call this selected time and this will be

109
00:08:05.030 --> 00:08:08.000
again an integer optional.

110
00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:15.050
So let me come over here and if I do that comment B to synchronize everything then I can reach those

111
00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:17.690
variables from here as well.

112
00:08:17.690 --> 00:08:23.140
Now let me wait until this is finished building our up our project.

113
00:08:23.180 --> 00:08:23.690
Here you go.

114
00:08:23.690 --> 00:08:27.710
Now we can say destination we see Dot selected snap.

115
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:30.730
Now I can make this equal to chosen snap.

116
00:08:30.740 --> 00:08:39.920
And here I can just say destination we see Dot select time and this will be our time left s that time

117
00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:40.430
left.

118
00:08:40.430 --> 00:08:49.780
Yep this one so that's how we pass this information to our snap controller so let's actually try this

119
00:08:49.790 --> 00:08:53.130
I believe we have everything to try.

120
00:08:53.140 --> 00:08:59.170
No we are just passing this information but we have to come to our stamp me controller and displayed

121
00:08:59.310 --> 00:09:05.350
information in our labels so that we can be sure that we pass this information.

122
00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:06.600
So let me do that.

123
00:09:06.620 --> 00:09:15.890
I'm going to call my time label dot text and this will display the selected time like this and not actually

124
00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:21.620
like this maybe we want to have time left string in front of this as well.

125
00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:23.420
So let me do it this way.

126
00:09:23.420 --> 00:09:30.070
Time left and that column and a backwards slash and over here you can just say select the time.

127
00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.830
So this will display the time.

128
00:09:34.130 --> 00:09:39.650
And right now I believe this is optional but we're going to take care of that later on if this works.

129
00:09:39.650 --> 00:09:41.500
So let me test this.

130
00:09:41.570 --> 00:09:46.090
So let me run this and let's see if we can make it work.

131
00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.480
So click on James.

132
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:48.470
And here you go.

133
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:54.350
Now we see the time left even though it's optional but it's very easy to take care of that.

134
00:09:54.500 --> 00:10:03.560
We can come over here and say if selected time or if time is if let's time is select time then we will

135
00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.110
have a non optional value of time.

136
00:10:06.110 --> 00:10:13.490
So I can come over here and say time rather than select a time and now wi fi run this from scratch then

137
00:10:13.520 --> 00:10:19.030
I will get time left but this time with non optional value.

138
00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:20.900
So let's test this.

139
00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:21.470
Here you go.

140
00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:23.750
Now we have the time left us.

141
00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:25.490
Twenty four hours.

142
00:10:26.090 --> 00:10:27.170
So here you go.

143
00:10:27.170 --> 00:10:32.630
Now we're ready to get the image slider in our game.

144
00:10:32.630 --> 00:10:34.880
So let's do that in the next lecture.
