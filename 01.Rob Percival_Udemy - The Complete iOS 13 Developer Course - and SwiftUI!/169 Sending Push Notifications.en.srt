00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,430
Hi.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:07,740
We did this lecture we going to finalize our app by adding the push notification functionality and the

3
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,210
like function.

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:15,690
OK so far we know how to send push notifications and how to gather you play your ideas.

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:18,790
Now we are going to combine this together.

6
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:26,770
So let me cut this and come into our feed cell where we do the liking functionality right.

7
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:33,930
And over here I'm going to post to push notifications so let me bring in the one saying no and let me

8
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,840
import the one signal as well.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:38,440
So that's how we do it.

10
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:45,230
Come over here and after like since the post I'm going to send the push notification as well.

11
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,040
So this post notification will work.

12
00:00:49,110 --> 00:00:56,040
But rather than saying text message I want to say somebody liked your post and this somebody will be

13
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,240
the current user logged in.

14
00:00:58,350 --> 00:00:59,120
Right.

15
00:00:59,130 --> 00:01:05,070
So rather than saying somebody I'm just going to get the current user logged in from authentication

16
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,310
module.

17
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:08,030
So how do we do that.

18
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:09,120
It's very easy.

19
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:14,690
We say of that of that current user that's e-mail.

20
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:15,390
OK.

21
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:23,040
So don't forget to enforce our app this and after that you can just say something like has liked your

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,830
post or liked your post.

23
00:01:25,830 --> 00:01:28,740
Ok so here you go.

24
00:01:28,770 --> 00:01:34,110
After that we have to find the play your idea of you like to user as well.

25
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:42,150
So how do we do that if we come over here we know the e-mail of the post on the right.

26
00:01:42,150 --> 00:01:49,170
We have this user e-mail labeled we can get that e-mail labeled and we can get the text out of that

27
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,190
label of course and we can use that email label to get the play your I.D. from fire or store.

28
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:58,380
So let's do that.

29
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,090
Let me call this user e-mail and say user e-mail labeled dot text.

30
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:03,760
OK.

31
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:11,430
After doing that I can't force our app is I believe because it won't be even just an empty value at

32
00:02:11,430 --> 00:02:12,960
this point.

33
00:02:12,960 --> 00:02:19,140
After doing that I'm just going to call five star database one more time because we're going to get

34
00:02:19,140 --> 00:02:25,400
the player idea of this user email so you can just say collection player I.D..

35
00:02:25,710 --> 00:02:26,680
OK.

36
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:31,130
So it was player I.D. or play your I.D. Let me come over here.

37
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:40,620
Yeah it was play your I.D. So player I.D. dot gets documents rather than that snapshot listener because

38
00:02:40,630 --> 00:02:43,910
we're only needing these ones at this point.

39
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:50,430
So I'm going to call this snapshot or error so if error is not nil or if error is nil.

40
00:02:50,430 --> 00:02:50,740
OK.

41
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:58,680
It's your call again if areas nil then I'm going to work on that snapshot I'm going to check to see

42
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,830
if snapshots dot is empty is false.

43
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:05,090
OK.

44
00:03:05,460 --> 00:03:08,830
And snapshot is not nailed.

45
00:03:08,880 --> 00:03:17,700
So once we do that we can just work on that snapshot and say for document in snapshot that documents

46
00:03:17,940 --> 00:03:21,380
like this snapshot dots documents.

47
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:22,480
OK.

48
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:26,960
And once we do that don't forget to force our Raptors as well.

49
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:32,650
And now I can get this by saying document dots yet OK.

50
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:36,590
And the field that I'm looking for is the play your I.D..

51
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:41,630
And over here I'm going to try and cast this to be string.

52
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:45,840
OK because we're saving this player ideas a string.

53
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:49,250
And don't forget to give a very field over here.

54
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:55,470
And our field will be e-mail and it will be equal to user e-mail.

55
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,200
OK.

56
00:03:56,460 --> 00:04:03,150
So we forgot to add this one if we don't do that it will bring all the player I.D. in the database.

57
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:08,330
So I'm going to check to see flat player I.D. document that gets s drink.

58
00:04:08,520 --> 00:04:13,950
And if that's the case now I want to do this push notification thing.

59
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:16,600
So let me cut this one as well.

60
00:04:16,620 --> 00:04:17,520
OK.

61
00:04:17,670 --> 00:04:23,100
So I will send this push notification to the play your I.D..

62
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:23,500
OK.

63
00:04:23,510 --> 00:04:26,910
So let me do this one more time.

64
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:30,310
Let me delete this and let me put.

65
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:33,210
Play your I.D. over here.

66
00:04:33,270 --> 00:04:34,590
So here you go.

67
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:42,090
Now we know the content that we're using and we have this data error.

68
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:42,330
Yeah.

69
00:04:42,330 --> 00:04:51,120
We have to put quotation marks inside of this curly braces are not curly races but a ray braces as well.

70
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,080
So come over here as a quotation mark.

71
00:04:55,200 --> 00:04:57,980
And again quotation mark.

72
00:04:58,140 --> 00:05:01,860
So that's it now we know they play your I.D..

73
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:03,900
Now we know the contents.

74
00:05:04,060 --> 00:05:06,730
And now we are ready to test this.

75
00:05:06,790 --> 00:05:10,990
So I'm going to run this on my real iPhone okay.

76
00:05:11,020 --> 00:05:15,380
And of course I'm going to run this on my simulator as well.

77
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:18,640
So we will have two devices to test this.

78
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:22,340
Oh so let's see if we can make this work.

79
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:28,210
So let me minimize all of this window so that we can see our phone and simulator.

80
00:05:28,210 --> 00:05:29,730
Let me close this down.

81
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:33,650
And on the left hand side I have my simulator.

82
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:36,910
And on the right hand side I have my phone.

83
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:39,390
So as you can see this is my phone.

84
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,290
So in the phone I'm logged in with James.

85
00:05:43,300 --> 00:05:46,000
And in the simulator I'm logged in with Kirk.

86
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,810
So I'm going to like one of the posts of James.

87
00:05:49,810 --> 00:05:50,600
And here you go.

88
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:51,760
Well I like this.

89
00:05:51,760 --> 00:05:55,030
I will see the notification popping up in my phone.

90
00:05:55,450 --> 00:06:01,810
And as you can see it says That's Kirk at Metallica dot com liked your post and it's fantastic.

91
00:06:01,810 --> 00:06:06,220
As I click on it it will take me to the app itself.

92
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:08,730
So let me test this one more time.

93
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:15,130
Let me like this and I will get the notification over here and then I click on that it will take me

94
00:06:15,160 --> 00:06:20,350
to the app itself and let me test this vile app is open.

95
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:29,140
So let me try to like this and let me just close down the do not disturb mode so we can see the notifications.

96
00:06:29,170 --> 00:06:29,990
OK.

97
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:31,650
So if I like this here you go.

98
00:06:31,660 --> 00:06:38,230
Now I see the notification and let's test this while using another app like let me go into the books

99
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:42,310
app so that we can actually test this.

100
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:49,510
So when we like it it will pop up on the top of our screen in our actual form.

101
00:06:49,930 --> 00:06:55,930
And if I click on it it will take me to my Instagram firebase cone.

102
00:06:55,930 --> 00:06:56,620
Here you go.

103
00:06:56,620 --> 00:06:59,080
Now it works perfect.

104
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:05,500
Of course there are other features that you can implement with one signal like you can handle the incoming

105
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:09,580
notifications and you can choose what to do when a notification comes.

106
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:15,310
Of course you're going to have to read the documentation in order to do that but now you know how to

107
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:21,900
send notifications which is great so that you can integrate this technique with all of your apps.

108
00:07:21,910 --> 00:07:25,510
Now let's stop here and continue within the next lecture.
