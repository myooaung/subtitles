00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:07,320
Hi within this lecture we're going to learn about a Neve loop called for loop.

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:15,440
Again we will use this for loop in order to do some operation repetitively until a condition breaks.

3
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,310
So let me rename this to for a loop and re going to start writing in here.

4
00:00:22,350 --> 00:00:27,430
So for loop basically works perfectly that array.

5
00:00:27,450 --> 00:00:34,350
So you're going to see a lot of examples where we use for loop with arrays and in fact I'm going to

6
00:00:34,350 --> 00:00:42,570
tell you with an array example so that it will be on your hats for loops go perfectly and synchronized

7
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:44,200
with arrays.

8
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:51,780
So let me create an array named my fruit array and I'm going to named as banana apple.

9
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,520
Maybe we can add one more like orange.

10
00:00:55,580 --> 00:00:56,170
Okay.

11
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:59,820
So we have an array with three elements in.

12
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,510
So let's suppose that I have to print out these three elements.

13
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:08,160
So how do we do that.

14
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:11,130
I believe right now you know the answer right.

15
00:01:11,130 --> 00:01:12,810
We have seen this.

16
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:14,650
So let me comment out.

17
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:20,580
Just prints that we have been doing so far so that the logs will be clear.

18
00:01:20,770 --> 00:01:21,300
OK.

19
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:29,790
When we print something and let me run this in order to just delete everything from here.

20
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,790
So right now I can easily say Bring me the first element.

21
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,240
Do you know want to do this right.

22
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:44,040
My fruits are a zero and I can just call print my fruit there a zero and then I can copy and paste this

23
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:52,680
line and just say my foods are a one two right and this will bring me banana apple and orange in the

24
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:53,040
log.

25
00:01:53,070 --> 00:01:55,620
So that was easy.

26
00:01:55,620 --> 00:02:01,110
So what would happen if I had that thousand fruits in my fruit tree.

27
00:02:01,440 --> 00:02:08,860
Then I will be copying and pasting these four thousand times and it won't make sense to do such work.

28
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:10,860
So we don't do it this way.

29
00:02:10,890 --> 00:02:19,980
We use a for loop in order to have every element do something in our race.

30
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:22,120
So you start with four keyword.

31
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:28,530
OK and you choose and the variable name so I'm going to call this fruit but it doesn't matter you can

32
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:30,090
call it distinct.

33
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:31,520
Anything you want.

34
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:39,060
I'm going to explain what it does later on right now you have to add one key word in.

35
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,760
OK.

36
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:46,170
So this in keyword after just in keyword you have to say in what in your array.

37
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:53,320
So choose your array and open curly braces and will create a coding block for you.

38
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,330
So what does this do.

39
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:55,460
Let me explain.

40
00:02:55,470 --> 00:03:03,930
So we're doing this inside of our my fruit tree and this loop will take these elements one by one and

41
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:06,490
then sign it to be a fruit.

42
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:13,690
So in the first loop in the first of the fruit will be banana in the second loop.

43
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:17,810
It will be Apple and the third loop it will be orange.

44
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:22,950
So if I print this fruit see what will happen.

45
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:32,100
We got the exact same results over here so let me explain one more time what happened here.

46
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:38,370
So we started with iterating through these elements so to banana.

47
00:03:38,430 --> 00:03:39,840
And they signed it to we fruit.

48
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:46,110
So we printed out banana and then it went to Apple and then it went to orange.

49
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:51,710
And this continues as long as there is an element inside of an array.

50
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:57,960
The condition here is that there is an element if there is not the loop breaks.

51
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:02,530
So we went through this loop three times and then it broke.

52
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:10,880
So let me do another example let me create my numbers array and it will be some integer type.

53
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:14,450
Okay 10 20 30 40 50 60.

54
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:19,650
Can we do 40 for loop thing in an integer array.

55
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,000
Of course we can.

56
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:27,510
And it would make much more sense to you right now because we're going to do some mathematical operations

57
00:04:27,780 --> 00:04:30,900
for each element inside of this area.

58
00:04:31,920 --> 00:04:39,270
And as a practice I suggest you posed the video and try to come up with a for loop that takes these

59
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:42,370
numbers and divides them by five.

60
00:04:42,780 --> 00:04:52,470
So you're going to have to divide each element inside of my numbers array with five.

61
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:59,310
I hope you got it by yourself but if you couldn't it doesn't matter I'm just going to show you how to

62
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:00,110
do that.

63
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:08,590
I'm going to create another for a loop and I will call this num or number K in my numbers.

64
00:05:08,670 --> 00:05:11,040
I will open my curly braces.

65
00:05:11,050 --> 00:05:16,960
Then I'm going to print out num divided by five.

66
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:20,250
OK so this will take num.

67
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:28,410
This will take every element and then assign it to be NUM and divided by five as you can see now we

68
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:30,010
can see the results.

69
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:36,100
As you can see by using for loops we can do things very efficiently.

70
00:05:36,480 --> 00:05:45,960
When you use an array in your app I believe there should be or will be probably a time in which you

71
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:55,110
have to use for loop because they bring so much efficiency in system and this is not the only place

72
00:05:55,110 --> 00:06:00,570
that we can use for loops in fact we can use for loops by their own as well.

73
00:06:00,780 --> 00:06:09,060
We don't need some array but it would make much more sense to use this with arrays we generally use

74
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:13,730
them for array iterating through purposes.

75
00:06:13,770 --> 00:06:17,450
Let me do another example I'm going to call this my number.

76
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:22,850
I'm going to say in 1 3 that's 5.

77
00:06:22,860 --> 00:06:24,790
So what does this mean.

78
00:06:24,810 --> 00:06:32,730
It means that create an array like object and it will come from.

79
00:06:32,730 --> 00:06:36,060
It will start from 1 and it will end in 5.

80
00:06:36,060 --> 00:06:43,350
So let me change this by the way because this is going to be a mess in here we named everything my number.

81
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:50,730
So let me call this my new integer and let me run this as you can see we got the result of 1 2 3 4 5

82
00:06:51,540 --> 00:07:00,540
so we can do stuff like this we can just multiply it by five as well so we will get what five 10 15

83
00:07:00,540 --> 00:07:01,950
20 25.

84
00:07:02,050 --> 00:07:11,370
OK so as you can see we can do it like this without arrays but it doesn't make sense but we as it makes

85
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:18,120
might says it's great to use for loops with arrays and we're going to do that a lot.

86
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:28,140
Just don't forget that when you use an array if you do something with each element of it you must use

87
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:36,240
for loops and if you feel kind of lost right now it's perfectly normal you're just starting to learn

88
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:41,380
about a new language a new development the environment it's perfectly normal.

89
00:07:41,390 --> 00:07:44,010
We gonna do a lot of examples.

90
00:07:44,020 --> 00:07:50,730
We gonna build a lot of apps in which we will practice all of this information right now.

91
00:07:50,810 --> 00:07:54,990
You're just learning learning learning and you're not practicing yet at all.

92
00:07:55,230 --> 00:07:57,840
Don't worry Regan I'll take care of it.

93
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:03,870
So let's stop here and within the next lecture we're going to use some if controls.
