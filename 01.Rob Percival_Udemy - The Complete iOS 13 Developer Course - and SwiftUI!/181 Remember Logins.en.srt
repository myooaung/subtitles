00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:08,840
Hi we didn't this lecture we going to find a way to remember the user so that every time we open the

2
00:00:08,840 --> 00:00:12,050
app it won't ask us for a user name and password.

3
00:00:12,350 --> 00:00:19,570
If the user has been previously logged in it will just take the user to the places we've controller.

4
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,600
So what we going to do is the same thing that we did in the file your bass section.

5
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,760
So we have used this scene delegate.

6
00:00:27,770 --> 00:00:34,460
Maybe you remember we have used this will connect to session function so that's what we gonna do in

7
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:35,740
this section as well.

8
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:40,260
But before we go on and do that I'm going to show you.

9
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:46,020
If you do that under we did loading the view controller it won't work again.

10
00:00:46,430 --> 00:00:51,020
So let me show you how this goes if you create the user called current user.

11
00:00:51,170 --> 00:00:55,540
And if you say APF user dot current.

12
00:00:55,580 --> 00:01:01,130
So this gives the currently logged in user and returns the instance of it.

13
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:05,690
So if this is not nil it means that there is a current user.

14
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:06,570
Right.

15
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:14,750
So if you say current user you get a P.F. user and if this is if this is not Neal again then you can

16
00:01:14,750 --> 00:01:20,450
actually see the email or user name or password of this user.

17
00:01:20,480 --> 00:01:26,020
So let me run this and let's see if we can get this user in our logs.

18
00:01:26,030 --> 00:01:27,110
OK.

19
00:01:27,320 --> 00:01:34,010
So let's come over here and as you can see we can see the James as optional.

20
00:01:34,010 --> 00:01:41,210
So James has been previously logged in even though this is logged in we cannot take user to the places

21
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:42,130
we controller.

22
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:49,790
So can we do something like if current user is not Neal take us to the places where you controller by

23
00:01:49,790 --> 00:01:52,910
doing a Segway right.

24
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:56,500
No we cannot do that actually because it won't work.

25
00:01:56,510 --> 00:02:04,510
And as you can see let me writes with that identifier two places we see and try to perform the Segway.

26
00:02:04,670 --> 00:02:11,560
So once I do that it won't take me to the places we've controller because we have to do that under seen

27
00:02:11,570 --> 00:02:17,270
delegate before everything loads up and we have to change the routes we have controller.

28
00:02:17,270 --> 00:02:17,510
Right.

29
00:02:17,510 --> 00:02:23,900
That's what we did in the firebase section and it doesn't make sense to do a Segway here it doesn't

30
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,160
make sense to load these weave controller at all.

31
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:34,760
So best way to do that is to check this on the scene delegate and if that's the case then change the

32
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:36,480
route we've controller.

33
00:02:36,530 --> 00:02:43,320
So let me cut everything from here on come over here under our scene delegates.

34
00:02:43,340 --> 00:02:51,620
So first of all in order to use this class I'm going to import pass in here as well done P.F. user won't

35
00:02:51,620 --> 00:02:53,010
give me an error.

36
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:58,700
This will give you an error because we cannot use perform Segway in scene delegates.

37
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:01,920
We don't have any controller in here.

38
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:06,700
Rather I'm going to create my UI screen board storyboard.

39
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,760
Actually as a variable.

40
00:03:08,870 --> 00:03:19,000
So the name of this storyboard is main am going to create a variable representing our places we have

41
00:03:19,010 --> 00:03:20,960
controller right.

42
00:03:21,350 --> 00:03:25,070
So that I can instantiate that we have controller.

43
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:34,570
So I'm going to say boards that instantiate instantiate we've controller and it asks us for an identifier.

44
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:40,080
So I don't have any current identifiers because we haven't give them one.

45
00:03:40,100 --> 00:03:40,430
Right.

46
00:03:40,790 --> 00:03:47,120
So if you come over here to places we've controller you can give them but in fact you don't want to

47
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:52,440
give any identifier to places you controller you want to do that in navigation.

48
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:58,970
We've controller so choose navigation we have controller and say something like navigation controller

49
00:03:59,000 --> 00:04:05,270
as a storyboard I.D. and the remembered the class here is UI navigation controller.

50
00:04:05,270 --> 00:04:08,490
It doesn't have any specific dots moved files.

51
00:04:08,660 --> 00:04:12,530
So we are going to cast this as a navigation controller.

52
00:04:12,530 --> 00:04:19,990
So in identifier I'm writing the exact same thing that I have written there and I'm going to first cast

53
00:04:19,990 --> 00:04:22,370
this as UI navigation controller.

54
00:04:22,460 --> 00:04:27,540
And since this is actually a UI navigation controller it won't fail.

55
00:04:27,650 --> 00:04:33,140
So rather than calling this places we see I'm going to call these navigation controller in order to

56
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:35,440
avoid any confusion.

57
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:44,330
And in here I'm going to call the window as a route wi controller and say navigation controller.

58
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:45,890
So what does it do.

59
00:04:45,890 --> 00:04:49,730
It takes this entry points inside in front of.

60
00:04:49,730 --> 00:04:56,280
Does navigation controller so that we can change the launching we you controller.

61
00:04:56,330 --> 00:05:02,650
So what we're going to see when we first launch the app is going to be the places we have controller

62
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:07,860
if and only if the user has been previously logged in.

63
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:08,920
So here you go.

64
00:05:08,920 --> 00:05:14,560
Now we see the places we controller right and this works.

65
00:05:14,650 --> 00:05:16,930
But this time we got another problem.

66
00:05:16,930 --> 00:05:23,200
We have to have a lock out button here so that the user can log out any time they want.

67
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:26,350
So how do we do that.

68
00:05:26,350 --> 00:05:32,410
Let's go to places where you controller and we're going to add another navigation bar item this time

69
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:36,610
it's going to be a left bar item rather than a right bar item right.

70
00:05:36,610 --> 00:05:39,240
So I'm going to say log out here.

71
00:05:39,460 --> 00:05:47,050
And if this works then I'm going to go back to my sign in week controller.

72
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:51,510
So let's go to places we have controller and let's add.

73
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:59,610
And Neil Bogden over here let's call navigation controller dot navigation bar dot top item.

74
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:00,400
OK.

75
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,950
Dots left bar about an item.

76
00:06:02,980 --> 00:06:05,290
So this is last for about an item.

77
00:06:05,290 --> 00:06:08,170
So this is going to be on the left rather than right.

78
00:06:08,170 --> 00:06:10,960
This is going to be the only difference.

79
00:06:11,050 --> 00:06:15,060
And actually the other difference will be the style of this button.

80
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:22,500
So I'm not going to go for a bar button system item this time because I just want to have a title in

81
00:06:22,510 --> 00:06:23,350
my bottom.

82
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:27,550
So I'm just going to give a specific value something like logout.

83
00:06:27,640 --> 00:06:30,920
So I'm going to choose this one with sites of.

84
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,730
So this asks us for a string and string will be log out and sail again.

85
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,470
I can just choose something like done or plain.

86
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:43,970
This is regular style.

87
00:06:44,020 --> 00:06:51,640
Let's go for plain for example and let's see if this looks good and if it doesn't we can always come

88
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,340
back here and change it.

89
00:06:53,350 --> 00:07:01,510
Targets will be self for action let me create another function called log up button clicked OK so that

90
00:07:01,540 --> 00:07:04,870
we can add this as a selector over here.

91
00:07:04,890 --> 00:07:10,580
So this will be selector and logout button clicked.

92
00:07:10,630 --> 00:07:11,680
Here you go.

93
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:20,590
Now what we're going to do here is to log out from the pass and bring the user to our sign up.

94
00:07:20,590 --> 00:07:21,880
We have controller.

95
00:07:21,970 --> 00:07:25,080
So let me import the parts first of all.

96
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:31,080
And we're going to take the user to the weave controller that Swift.

97
00:07:31,090 --> 00:07:35,870
So for logging out I'm going to use P.F. user dot log out.

98
00:07:35,980 --> 00:07:42,610
And again we have some options over here I'm going to go for log out in background with block so that

99
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:50,050
if I have any error like losing the internet connection or something I can just show it to the user.

100
00:07:50,110 --> 00:07:51,120
OK.

101
00:07:51,310 --> 00:07:54,150
And let me choose design hit enter.

102
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:55,810
It will give me error.

103
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,450
If there is any error I'm just going to show it to the user.

104
00:07:59,500 --> 00:08:00,360
If there is not.

105
00:08:00,370 --> 00:08:03,220
It means that it's worked out well.

106
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:10,720
So let me create the error here and we don't have any other messages right now so I'm going to create

107
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:11,580
one.

108
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:13,180
Let's do this fast.

109
00:08:13,180 --> 00:08:19,700
So this is going to be an Elliott controller with title error message error that localized description.

110
00:08:20,020 --> 00:08:20,670
OK.

111
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,660
Style will be entered that style.

112
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,070
So the next thing will be for me to create an ok by then.

113
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,080
This is going to be an action and for a title I'm going to say OK.

114
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,480
And for style I'm going to go for default.

115
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:44,920
And I don't think any handler I'm going to add this to my efforts as an action and I'm going to display

116
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:54,250
the zealot bit soft present and then I'm going to go to Elliot's here with animation without completion.

117
00:08:54,250 --> 00:09:01,810
And if that's not the case if there is not any error it means that I get to go from here to my weave

118
00:09:01,810 --> 00:09:07,990
controller and in order to do dots I don't have any method right now.

119
00:09:07,990 --> 00:09:08,580
Right.

120
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,210
Because I cannot use navigation controller like we did before.

121
00:09:14,110 --> 00:09:20,270
So here I have to come from here to my sign in which controllers.

122
00:09:20,280 --> 00:09:24,620
So let me do a show Segway right.

123
00:09:24,790 --> 00:09:34,090
And if I do a show Segway it gives us a navigation bar by them which I don't want I don't want the user

124
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:37,990
to go back from sign in view controller to here.

125
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,310
So I'm going to present this model T and I'm going to do this full screen so that's good.

126
00:09:44,410 --> 00:09:49,300
And I'm going to give you an identifier to sign up.

127
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:50,520
We see.

128
00:09:50,860 --> 00:09:56,980
And this is not named sign up right now I'm going to change its name later on but for right now I'm

129
00:09:56,980 --> 00:10:04,860
going to copied this and come over here and say self-taught power form Segway for identifier.

130
00:10:04,850 --> 00:10:09,210
I'm going to say to sign up LISI AND SON There will be Neil.

131
00:10:09,210 --> 00:10:17,510
So let's test this let's run this in our simulator it shall take us to the places we've controller automatically

132
00:10:17,510 --> 00:10:24,230
because we are already signed in and here we go now we see the log out bottom if I click over here it

133
00:10:24,230 --> 00:10:33,230
takes me to my sign up we see now let me run this from scratch and if it takes us to the sign up we

134
00:10:33,230 --> 00:10:40,220
see that it works fine and here you go it works fine because you have already been logged out let's

135
00:10:40,490 --> 00:10:44,670
run in with James One two three four five six.

136
00:10:44,690 --> 00:10:45,840
Here you go next.

137
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:48,040
Now let's run it from scratch.

138
00:10:48,040 --> 00:10:52,580
One more time to see if we see places we see here you go.

139
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:53,530
Now we are in.

140
00:10:54,620 --> 00:10:57,260
So sign in sign up log out.

141
00:10:57,350 --> 00:11:00,010
Everything seems to be working pretty good.

142
00:11:00,030 --> 00:11:01,580
So we are dumb.

143
00:11:01,610 --> 00:11:05,270
We it's our authentication procedures.

144
00:11:05,720 --> 00:11:07,610
So let me rename this.

145
00:11:07,610 --> 00:11:13,620
In fact there are a couple of ways to rename this and I'm going to show you the easiest one.

146
00:11:13,670 --> 00:11:14,360
OK.

147
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:21,620
You can just click over here to view controller to rename this file manually but then it means that

148
00:11:21,620 --> 00:11:24,090
you have to change everything manually.

149
00:11:24,200 --> 00:11:31,550
Most basic way to do that is to come over here and right click and say Refactor Rename.

150
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:36,950
So when you do that it will change everything regarding to view controller.

151
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:42,740
So it will rename every line that we are using this view controller in.

152
00:11:42,770 --> 00:11:51,080
OK so if you want something like sign up then you're more than welcome to do it and say rename once

153
00:11:51,080 --> 00:11:55,580
you say rename it will change the class name from here from here.

154
00:11:55,670 --> 00:12:01,000
And if you're using it anywhere in the project it will change it as well.

155
00:12:01,010 --> 00:12:08,450
So best way to rename variables or classes or any object is to right click on it and say Read fact to

156
00:12:08,450 --> 00:12:10,110
rename.

157
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:15,780
So when I run this on my simulator everything seems to be working so it didn't break anything.

158
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:19,490
We are done with our authentication.

159
00:12:19,490 --> 00:12:21,380
Now we need to move on.

160
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:28,160
First of all I'm going to create a user interface I'm going to bring in all my weave controllers so

161
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,900
that we can start working on them.

162
00:12:30,900 --> 00:12:34,190
Finally let's do that in the next lecture.
