00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.170
Hi within this lecture Regan to create our X code project I'm bringing the process the case in our X

2
00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:13.680
code project so I'm going to click over here to create a new single view app under IRS tab.

3
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.110
So let me bring this down.

4
00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:16.410
Yep.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.540
This one single weave up and in here I'm going to call this Foursquare clone.

6
00:00:22.070 --> 00:00:23.370
OK.

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.450
And you don't have to have any swift UI or core data features.

8
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:30.750
So let me just rename this as clone.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:31.850
Yep.

10
00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:33.740
So click on Next.

11
00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:37.860
I'm going to put this under my downloads and AOS complete folder.

12
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:41.400
So you're more than welcome to put it anywhere you want.

13
00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:49.590
OK after that we're going to open our project here but actually we're not going to do anything yet because

14
00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:56.990
I want to start with integrating the pass as the case to my project and in order to do that of course

15
00:00:56.990 --> 00:01:03.030
we you're going to create a path file where you're going to use cocoa parts and in order to do that

16
00:01:03.030 --> 00:01:05.910
we have to close these down for right now.

17
00:01:05.910 --> 00:01:06.600
Right.

18
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.610
So after you create your project you're you can close it.

19
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:13.220
Close that down and open your terminal.

20
00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.880
So we have worked with terminal before.

21
00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:25.020
So I assume you know how to go around the inside of your terminal and create a pod file and edit the

22
00:01:25.020 --> 00:01:28.550
pod file and just install the pod file.

23
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:30.620
So I'm going to do this quick.

24
00:01:30.630 --> 00:01:37.650
So go to your downloads or if you're on desktop Of course you have to write C desktop and in downloads

25
00:01:37.740 --> 00:01:43.170
I need to go to ISIS complete folder and then for square comb folder.

26
00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:50.530
So basically I mean side my project folder and that's where I want to run pod it.

27
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:57.360
So if you don't know what I'm doing right now I suggest you go back and watch cocoa pod section.

28
00:01:57.390 --> 00:02:02.620
Cocoa Pods lecture in five your base are in top lectures.

29
00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.140
OK so I have to open this pulled file that we have created.

30
00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:10.170
So let me make this a little bit bigger.

31
00:02:10.170 --> 00:02:11.520
Yep.

32
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:17.700
So after saying use frameworks we have to write the pods name itself.

33
00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:26.110
So let's go back to get Hub Repository of ISIS T.J. and we're going to have to copy this pod pass.

34
00:02:26.310 --> 00:02:33.870
So let's read here and little bits of for example let's say that after you say pod pars you after party

35
00:02:33.930 --> 00:02:40.160
install the app we know that but if you want to use something like Facebook utilize are to either utilize

36
00:02:40.170 --> 00:02:45.030
you have to bring in those parts as valve we're not going to do that.

37
00:02:45.030 --> 00:02:49.890
This is actually related to signing in with Twitter or Facebook.

38
00:02:49.890 --> 00:02:54.950
We don't even know how to sign in with parts of its email or user name.

39
00:02:54.960 --> 00:02:57.640
So first of all we going to take care of that.

40
00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:04.140
So you can just skip all of this Facebook utilize Twitter you tools you can just copy and paste part

41
00:03:04.140 --> 00:03:11.970
pass and come over here and paste it once you do that you can just save this and come over here and

42
00:03:11.970 --> 00:03:13.870
run party install.

43
00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:21.930
So as you do that as you can see it starts the download the necessary libraries necessary modules for

44
00:03:21.930 --> 00:03:24.550
your ex called projects.

45
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:27.980
So we're downloading two main things the ball to end the pass.

46
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:31.060
So this come together and they work together.

47
00:03:31.110 --> 00:03:38.250
So they're kind of different modules but they have to be exactly on the same time on the same project

48
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.700
to be working.

49
00:03:39.720 --> 00:03:47.820
So after you do that you can just close down the terminal and you have to come over here to your ex

50
00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:55.440
coach work space or other the next code project and open the X code workspace files.

51
00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:56.310
So that's it.

52
00:03:56.340 --> 00:04:02.370
That's how you actually import the process as the case in your project.

53
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:11.040
After this indexing completes we can try to see if we really managed to get the pass in our project

54
00:04:11.400 --> 00:04:14.160
and we can't see Paris being here.

55
00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.040
So I believe that's good.

56
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:25.410
But we have to try to be certain that we can run we can call the pass classes or pass method some functions.

57
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:33.690
So after the processing and indexing completes you can come over here to try importing parts like this

58
00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:41.280
and this works for me as you can see I can import the parts and I can call pass classes here.

59
00:04:41.310 --> 00:04:42.810
Same pass.

60
00:04:42.810 --> 00:04:44.190
So this is good.

61
00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:45.860
Let me delete this.

62
00:04:45.930 --> 00:04:54.660
But if you didn't work in your case if you cannot import parts you can't come over here to your general

63
00:04:54.660 --> 00:05:03.120
settings and under these build phases you can see something called Link binary with libraries in fact

64
00:05:03.660 --> 00:05:10.320
all you have to do is just import this parts first chrome framework as you can see but if it doesn't

65
00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:16.810
work you can just bring in these bolts and pass as well saying add on that bottom.

66
00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:26.220
But in my case this works so I'm not going to mess this up by just adding more libraries over here so

67
00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:29.880
I'm going to proceed as it is.

68
00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:31.350
So far so good.

69
00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:35.780
We managed to bring in the SD case but this is not enough.

70
00:05:35.790 --> 00:05:38.880
We have to configure our back for app.

71
00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:45.360
We have to create an account and create a server in back for app so that we can connect our project

72
00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:47.310
with our server.

73
00:05:47.310 --> 00:05:50.070
So that's what we are going to do in the next lecture.
