00:00:00,340 --> 00:00:01,100
Hi.

2
00:00:01,260 --> 00:00:08,340
We didn't this lecture we going to bring in the images that we have imported every going to start working

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,230
on our design in the game scene that SARS.

4
00:00:12,790 --> 00:00:18,750
So we're going to be working with sprites here as I said before and spread this kind of a view that

5
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:19,650
you can change it.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:27,930
But James it's background and change its color so that you can have a view that you can work with inside

7
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:30,510
of your sprite kid project.

8
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:35,360
So when you first bring in a sprite you will see something like this.

9
00:00:35,390 --> 00:00:36,070
Okay.

10
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:43,500
As you can see we have a red color right now and I'm just expanding it so that it will fit inside of

11
00:00:43,500 --> 00:00:45,440
my frame or here.

12
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:50,570
So I can't change its background I can change its color.

13
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:57,810
But for right now I just want to open my simulator to see if we really see the sprite over here as you

14
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:00,230
can see now we have this red.

15
00:01:00,380 --> 00:01:08,640
And let me rotate my device to the left so that we can use it in an landscape mode.

16
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:09,650
So here you go.

17
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:15,950
This is our game right now we have a red background and we did it with our colors sprite.

18
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:17,640
So let me close this down.

19
00:01:18,270 --> 00:01:25,220
And rather than having a red background over here can I have my background image.

20
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:26,240
Yep.

21
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,410
I can use that.

22
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,450
It's called texture.

23
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:37,850
In this case as we move on to the games the all terminology changes as you can see now we have a sprite.

24
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:41,280
We have textures rather than background.

25
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:48,930
I'm really going to have to get used to the fact that this terminology changes once we move on to these

26
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:49,970
bright kids.

27
00:01:50,070 --> 00:01:56,250
And as you can see we now have these images over here and if I choose the background as a texture to

28
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,580
my Sprite kids now it will just bring in this background over here.

29
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,850
So I'm going to make this a little bit smaller so that I can just feed it into the frame or you can

30
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,640
exceed the size a little bit so that it would work on bigger screen sizes as well.

31
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,590
So this is a main disadvantage of working with game scene that is scarce.

32
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:28,230
If we were to define this in code we would have the chance to define it for a reality of screen sizes

33
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:32,670
so that it would actually work better in different screen sizes.

34
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:41,760
But in game scene that is cast we just define the size in a given way then heights and we're going to

35
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,110
see how to do it in code.

36
00:02:43,110 --> 00:02:50,310
Don't worry so I'm going to change this background to something white right now because we already have

37
00:02:50,310 --> 00:02:56,110
our background but different image right now so that we can't see better.

38
00:02:56,170 --> 00:02:59,090
I believe this is better for you to see.

39
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:00,320
And here you go.

40
00:03:00,330 --> 00:03:04,980
This is our frame and we're exceeding the frame a little bit.

41
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:08,380
You can make this a little bit smaller as well.

42
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:14,880
Where are you going to try this in our simulator to see how this looks like and if it looks like good

43
00:03:15,150 --> 00:03:22,250
then I'm going to leave it as it is and I'm going to bring my next views like trees or birds.

44
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:23,230
Here you go.

45
00:03:23,250 --> 00:03:31,690
I believe we could just make this a little bit smaller in height to see the base as well like this.

46
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:38,690
So let me run this one more time and let's see if we can see the base here again.

47
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:42,030
Now we see this green base which is good.

48
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:47,820
Now I'm going to bring in my tree and then my bird and my bricks as well.

49
00:03:48,390 --> 00:03:49,500
So far so good.

50
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,090
So let me open the library one more time and bring in one color sprite.

51
00:03:54,450 --> 00:03:58,560
And in here I'm going to choose the texture as tree.

52
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:01,200
So this will bring in my tree.

53
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:10,080
So let me try to actually make this a little bit smaller so let's seats it has a huge size as you can

54
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:12,570
see you can't change the size from here.

55
00:04:12,750 --> 00:04:19,710
Like you can say six hundred to something or you can just make it smaller like this.

56
00:04:19,710 --> 00:04:20,360
OK.

57
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:24,180
So I'm going to make this smaller this way.

58
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:28,860
So I'm going to place it on my grass like this.

59
00:04:28,860 --> 00:04:33,540
And you can just play with it until you're satisfied with your tree.

60
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,470
You can try to make this smaller.

61
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:40,500
You can try to make this around from here for example.

62
00:04:40,890 --> 00:04:43,260
OK I'm not going to do that.

63
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:47,460
I'm just going to use it exactly how with this like this.

64
00:04:47,460 --> 00:04:47,910
OK.

65
00:04:47,910 --> 00:04:54,930
Now this and I believe that's good for our tree regrowing to use it as a slingshot.

66
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:01,160
Anyway it's not going to do I think rather than holding our Bert.

67
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:09,540
And then later on let's run this one more time to see if we see the tree over our background.

68
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:11,830
And here you go.

69
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:13,820
It looks nice right.

70
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:16,400
So we arranged to bring in the bird.

71
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:22,710
So let's open the library and choose color Sprite and choose texture.

72
00:05:22,710 --> 00:05:24,220
As bert.

73
00:05:24,270 --> 00:05:29,610
So as you can see our bird is a little bit bigger so I'm going to make this smaller.

74
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:30,290
Yep.

75
00:05:30,390 --> 00:05:32,370
This is good.

76
00:05:32,370 --> 00:05:38,350
Let me put my bird over my tree and let me use this as a slingshots.

77
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Yep this is good.

78
00:05:40,470 --> 00:05:46,920
So we're going to stretch the bird from here and this will turn of the bird as we do that of course

79
00:05:46,920 --> 00:05:51,290
we're going to have to write that code for that later on.

80
00:05:51,390 --> 00:05:54,700
Now I believe we can bring in our bricks.

81
00:05:54,750 --> 00:05:55,510
Right.

82
00:05:55,560 --> 00:05:59,330
So let's open our library to break in a color sprite.

83
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:05,870
And this time from texture I'm going to go for brick and let's make this smaller.

84
00:06:06,180 --> 00:06:09,160
And let's just put it over here.

85
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:11,730
Let's make this a little bit smaller.

86
00:06:11,730 --> 00:06:12,270
Yep.

87
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:14,290
This is good.

88
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:19,440
Now I'm going to copy and paste is why pressing comment see and comment V.

89
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:25,840
I'm going to do this a couple of times to how I like a tower of bricks over here.

90
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:26,670
OK.

91
00:06:26,730 --> 00:06:33,900
I'm going to have five bricks in total so let's placed is over here.

92
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,190
And here you go.

93
00:06:35,190 --> 00:06:37,160
That's good.

94
00:06:37,170 --> 00:06:45,240
So make sure you have your bricks on top of each other because they will have some physical mass and

95
00:06:45,240 --> 00:06:48,570
they will be affected by gravity later on.

96
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,420
So they won't fall off from each other.

97
00:06:51,420 --> 00:06:54,880
So make sure they're placed carefully.

98
00:06:54,930 --> 00:06:55,840
OK.

99
00:06:56,190 --> 00:06:58,490
So far so good for our design.

100
00:06:58,500 --> 00:07:07,750
So let's try to run this on our simulator to see if they're on the place that we want them to be.

101
00:07:08,040 --> 00:07:13,860
As you can see them the open these simulator some of the views are not here.

102
00:07:13,860 --> 00:07:16,770
Actually none of them are over here.

103
00:07:16,830 --> 00:07:20,190
So this must be related to their z position.

104
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,100
So there is something called z position.

105
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:30,630
It's kind of a turd dimension and it defines which view is in the foreground then which view is in the

106
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:31,750
background.

107
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:39,060
For example if we make this Z minus one for the background it will be in the background begins because

108
00:07:39,060 --> 00:07:40,980
it's already the background.

109
00:07:41,040 --> 00:07:41,760
OK.

110
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:49,160
So it makes sense to make this minus one and have all other views in zero.

111
00:07:49,170 --> 00:07:49,770
OK.

112
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:55,640
For example if I want this bird to be in the foreground then it compares to the tree.

113
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:03,480
Then I can make this one and I can make the 3 0 and I can make background at minus one and I can make

114
00:08:03,480 --> 00:08:05,370
brick zero as well.

115
00:08:05,370 --> 00:08:13,920
So when I add a number to the z position it means that it will get the priority to be shown in the foreground

116
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,610
as you can see we still have the circle things floating around.

117
00:08:17,640 --> 00:08:23,790
Because we haven't deleted the cold yet we're going to take care of that because in the next lecture

118
00:08:23,790 --> 00:08:31,230
regrowing to work on coding in the sprite kids so that we will know how to create views create sprites

119
00:08:31,230 --> 00:08:36,520
using coding section and we will know how to do other operations as well.

120
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:38,820
Let's do that in the next lecture.
