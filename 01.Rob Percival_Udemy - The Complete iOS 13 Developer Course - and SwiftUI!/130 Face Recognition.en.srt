00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,300
Hi.

2
00:00:01,490 --> 00:00:09,150
We within this lecture we going to see how to use face recognition in our apps and we're not only going

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:16,800
to see how to use face recognition but if you're working with something like iPhone 7 or iPhone 8 it

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,380
will also work on touch I.D. as well.

5
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,250
So I'm going to create a single new app.

6
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:27,260
I'm going to call this face recognition project.

7
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:35,130
OK so make sure that you choose swift and you you don't have to choose any of this checkboxes and then

8
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:44,420
he adds next and create so let's suppose that you're building an app and we want this app to be accessible

9
00:00:44,420 --> 00:00:47,630
by only the owner of this current iPhone.

10
00:00:48,050 --> 00:00:48,320
OK.

11
00:00:48,350 --> 00:00:55,010
So if somebody else is messing with your phone they cannot open it because it can only be accessible

12
00:00:55,340 --> 00:00:58,510
vit the face recognition or touch I.D..

13
00:00:59,210 --> 00:01:03,740
So what we gonna do we're gonna add a sign in button here.

14
00:01:03,740 --> 00:01:04,490
OK.

15
00:01:04,610 --> 00:01:07,190
So let me bring in a button.

16
00:01:07,190 --> 00:01:13,540
So this button will check us for the face recognition or a touch I.D..

17
00:01:13,850 --> 00:01:20,420
And if we can provide this if you can't pass the test then we can go to the second view controller in

18
00:01:20,420 --> 00:01:23,590
which we will have the real app of course.

19
00:01:23,660 --> 00:01:30,130
We're just going to build a second we have controller as an ad as an exemplary controller.

20
00:01:30,140 --> 00:01:36,650
We're not going to have any think fancy going on there but this will give us a great chance to learn

21
00:01:36,650 --> 00:01:41,210
how to utilize facial recognition in our apps.

22
00:01:41,210 --> 00:01:43,840
So I'm going to call this sign in.

23
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:44,490
OK.

24
00:01:44,570 --> 00:01:53,450
So when a user taps on this app they have to click on the sign in button and make sure that the face

25
00:01:53,450 --> 00:02:01,280
recognition matches with their face and then they can go to the second we controller.

26
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:08,690
So here we go to have this sign in button and maybe we can have a label as well showing the results

27
00:02:09,170 --> 00:02:11,600
of the face recognition.

28
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:16,630
So if the result is actually successful it will take us to the secondary controller.

29
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:21,180
But if it's not it can say something like error try again.

30
00:02:21,180 --> 00:02:25,190
OK so I'm going to have a simple label over here.

31
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:31,810
So make sure that this label is actually a little bit bigger so that we can write whatever we want here

32
00:02:31,820 --> 00:02:35,250
like an error message and that's it.

33
00:02:35,270 --> 00:02:37,340
That's all we want to do.

34
00:02:37,460 --> 00:02:39,170
In this we have controller.

35
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:40,430
Right.

36
00:02:40,460 --> 00:02:47,720
And later on we're going to add a second we have controller but before we do that let me come over here

37
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:50,660
to say reset to suggest its constraints.

38
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,830
So our button and label will have the necessary constraints.

39
00:02:54,830 --> 00:03:03,500
So then open the view controller and drag drag and drop does it clicking on the control as a sign in

40
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:04,300
clicked.

41
00:03:04,310 --> 00:03:04,700
OK.

42
00:03:04,700 --> 00:03:10,250
So this is going to be our button and for label I'm going to go for my label.

43
00:03:10,310 --> 00:03:11,310
OK.

44
00:03:11,570 --> 00:03:15,610
And this will display the error message that I was talking about.

45
00:03:15,620 --> 00:03:22,430
So let me just close this and that's it for the Vive controller.

46
00:03:22,430 --> 00:03:25,760
Now let's go to our Web controller.

47
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,400
So this is where we're going to call for face recognition.

48
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:30,520
OK.

49
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:36,710
And after this is successful it will take us to the other we have controllers so we're going to do a

50
00:03:36,710 --> 00:03:38,540
Segway in here.

51
00:03:38,570 --> 00:03:44,870
In fact let's go back to our main story board and put that second view controller as well so that we

52
00:03:44,870 --> 00:03:47,860
can have a Segway here.

53
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:55,550
So let me just call for a controller and drag drag and drop one here OK.

54
00:03:55,970 --> 00:03:58,550
And in the second we have a controller.

55
00:03:58,550 --> 00:04:04,570
I'm just going to have a label displaying the text of success.

56
00:04:04,580 --> 00:04:04,870
OK.

57
00:04:04,910 --> 00:04:10,480
So that I will know if I made it to the second view controller or not.

58
00:04:10,490 --> 00:04:18,540
So let me come over here to the center of this view controller and I'm just going to call those successful

59
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:20,540
or assigned then OK.

60
00:04:21,200 --> 00:04:25,310
And let me give the suggested constraints here as well.

61
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,580
I'm going to do a Segway from this one to this one.

62
00:04:28,580 --> 00:04:30,750
This is going to be a show Segway.

63
00:04:30,890 --> 00:04:39,350
And for identifier I'm just going to go for two seconds we see and in this stage I'm not even going

64
00:04:39,350 --> 00:04:46,850
to add a second set Coco to each class like a V controller file because we're not going to do anything

65
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,780
in the second controller.

66
00:04:48,830 --> 00:04:49,610
OK.

67
00:04:49,670 --> 00:04:57,860
And of course if this was a real app I could have I should have added the controller and connected with

68
00:04:57,860 --> 00:04:59,360
the second wave controller.

69
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,550
But you already know how to do that so I'm going to pass on that one.

70
00:05:04,640 --> 00:05:11,810
So in the sign in clicked all I want to do is just call a local authentication.

71
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,720
So I have to import that library first.

72
00:05:15,410 --> 00:05:18,230
And let me do a comment B.

73
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,100
I believe it's not seeing what it's supposed to see right now.

74
00:05:22,100 --> 00:05:30,650
So let me do a product clean as well so let me come over here and say import local authentication.

75
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:38,450
So it has to be something like this but since it's not working I'm not going to take any this.

76
00:05:38,640 --> 00:05:46,200
So if you come across in a situation like this just close the project and then go over your project

77
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:54,630
folder from here like face your cognition project and then open it one more time and I'm going to delete

78
00:05:54,630 --> 00:05:56,350
this and write it one more time.

79
00:05:56,370 --> 00:06:03,210
And as you can see it says indexing so I believe there was something on synchronized at the time.

80
00:06:03,330 --> 00:06:08,400
So if I write local authentication it look it sees the module right now.

81
00:06:08,670 --> 00:06:12,250
So I can call does local authentication from here.

82
00:06:12,390 --> 00:06:18,720
I'm going to create a local authentication context so I'm going to call this off contacts and it's going

83
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:21,300
to be an L.A. context object.

84
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:25,650
So this a context comes from does local authentication library.

85
00:06:25,830 --> 00:06:32,410
And this is a mechanism that lets us control the authentication process.

86
00:06:32,640 --> 00:06:34,080
So far so good.

87
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:41,690
First we have to check if this iPhone or iPad is capable of performing this action.

88
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:47,400
So I'm going to go for out old contacts that can evaluate policy.

89
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:55,890
OK so this will tell us if the iPhone is capable of running facial recognition or touch I.D. and the

90
00:06:55,890 --> 00:07:02,760
policy that I'm looking for if you hit that over here you will see device owner authentication with

91
00:07:02,790 --> 00:07:09,910
biometrics and biometrics meaning facial recognition or a touch I.D..

92
00:07:09,930 --> 00:07:10,230
OK.

93
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:19,560
So are we going to authenticate using biometrics so this method will give us either this has the capability

94
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:27,600
of not and this asks for an endless error pointer so we cannot simply come over here and hit enter and

95
00:07:27,600 --> 00:07:29,820
just write an error.

96
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:37,740
So this is a spatial type and it requires us to create an NSA error object in order to do that.

97
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:39,090
I'm going to go over here.

98
00:07:39,090 --> 00:07:40,710
Save our error.

99
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:44,060
And this is going to be an NSA error type.

100
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:44,610
OK.

101
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:45,520
This one.

102
00:07:46,050 --> 00:07:53,490
And of course this is going to be optional at this time because we didn't even initialize it.

103
00:07:53,490 --> 00:07:57,470
And then here I'm going to go for error.

104
00:07:57,660 --> 00:08:05,820
And in order to make this a pointer I have to say and in front of this error because it will give me

105
00:08:05,820 --> 00:08:12,600
a warning as you can see it says that I cannot convert this and this error type to be an this error

106
00:08:12,600 --> 00:08:14,790
pointer in order to do that.

107
00:08:14,790 --> 00:08:19,610
You can just type in and signing here.

108
00:08:19,620 --> 00:08:21,040
So this will be it.

109
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:29,910
This method will give us whether this is working with face recognition or touch I.D. or if the device

110
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:34,670
is not even capable of performing this we're not going to do anything in here.

111
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:35,670
OK.

112
00:08:35,790 --> 00:08:43,440
So after reading this if we can actually evaluate the policy itself so evaluating means calling this

113
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:44,280
for an action.

114
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:49,640
So it will check to see if we can parse for face recognition.

115
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:57,450
So in order to do that I'm going to say of context that evaluate policy rather than can evaluate policy

116
00:08:57,450 --> 00:08:58,390
this time.

117
00:08:58,500 --> 00:09:05,880
And this will ask me for the same thing one more time so it's asking me for the policy itself and the

118
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,400
policy will be the same thing.

119
00:09:07,410 --> 00:09:12,590
If you hit that you can't choose the device or another authentication with biometrics.

120
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:17,360
And we are going to have to give a localized reason here.

121
00:09:17,580 --> 00:09:22,580
Something like yeah I'm going to check your face in order to authenticate you.

122
00:09:22,740 --> 00:09:23,550
OK.

123
00:09:23,610 --> 00:09:25,930
So I'm just going to say is it you.

124
00:09:25,950 --> 00:09:26,370
OK.

125
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,370
So this will be our reason localized reason.

126
00:09:29,490 --> 00:09:32,740
And here it will give us a reply.

127
00:09:32,760 --> 00:09:36,950
So if you hit enter on that reply you will see two variables.

128
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:40,250
You either get a boolean or an error.

129
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,150
So you can just write error in here and you can write something like success in here because the first

130
00:09:48,150 --> 00:09:53,010
variable will give you if this is going to be working or not.

131
00:09:53,100 --> 00:09:58,970
And if you come across any error this error will be stored in the error variable.

132
00:09:58,980 --> 00:10:01,540
So this is called a closure.

133
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:02,530
OK.

134
00:10:02,580 --> 00:10:05,580
And I'm going to call.

135
00:10:05,670 --> 00:10:10,680
I'm going to check to see if success is true it means that we passed the test.

136
00:10:11,130 --> 00:10:16,880
So successful authentication and ls it means that I didn't pass the test.

137
00:10:16,890 --> 00:10:25,440
So I'm just going to go for print error or better yet I'm just going to say my labeled up tax is error.

138
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,400
So again this is called closure which means that we're doing some operation and in return we are getting

139
00:10:32,400 --> 00:10:34,290
some responses.

140
00:10:34,290 --> 00:10:43,680
And since we are in the closure we have to say s drop my label that taxed and in here I'm going to say

141
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:51,420
some of the perform Segway and the Segway identifier will be two seconds we V.C. and sun there will

142
00:10:51,420 --> 00:10:53,120
be Neil.

143
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:58,110
So that's it for evaluating the authentication policy.

144
00:10:58,770 --> 00:11:05,390
So what we did here we check to see if we can actually use this method in the current form that we're

145
00:11:05,430 --> 00:11:10,640
using and if we can we just said that yeah I'm going to go ahead and do that.

146
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:15,420
I'm going to check for device owner authentication with biometrics.

147
00:11:15,420 --> 00:11:21,140
And if this gives us a success then I'm going to do a perform Segway.

148
00:11:21,300 --> 00:11:28,560
So before we test out you have to come into the info P list and hit a plus button to add a new row.

149
00:11:28,580 --> 00:11:33,240
I remember we have worked with this privacy descriptions before.

150
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:35,430
So we're going to do the same thing as well.

151
00:11:35,670 --> 00:11:40,390
So we are looking for face I.D. usage description under privacy.

152
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:49,110
OK so you have to give a good result here like to authenticate to you have to do this to go in or something

153
00:11:49,110 --> 00:11:49,660
like that.

154
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:58,920
So after you do this let's go to we've controller and we can actually test is right now and this will

155
00:11:58,920 --> 00:12:00,030
give us an error.

156
00:12:00,070 --> 00:12:02,010
I'm gonna show you why.

157
00:12:02,010 --> 00:12:08,250
But before we do that let's test is and see the error by ourselves.

158
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:16,620
So I'm going to run this on our simulator and simulators at right now actually lets us simulate the

159
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:18,060
face recognition as well.

160
00:12:18,060 --> 00:12:19,530
So this is great.

161
00:12:19,530 --> 00:12:22,080
We didn't have that capability before.

162
00:12:22,110 --> 00:12:30,000
So in here the hardware face I.D. make sure that these enrolled is selected OK if you select as we can

163
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,630
test it to face I.D. reads our app.

164
00:12:33,630 --> 00:12:39,540
So when you click on this it will ask you for your face I.D. And in order to simulate the face I.D.

165
00:12:39,540 --> 00:12:44,260
you can come over here as a matching face or none matching face.

166
00:12:44,370 --> 00:12:48,810
So matching face means that this actually matches.

167
00:12:48,960 --> 00:12:50,310
And here we go.

168
00:12:50,400 --> 00:12:54,040
We have the error that I was talking about.

169
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:59,890
So let's see what the error is if we come back to our Controller.

170
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:04,470
We see some kind of a purple message that we haven't seen before.

171
00:13:05,460 --> 00:13:12,150
So if you click on this it says that this performs say good thing should be called from the main thread

172
00:13:12,150 --> 00:13:12,580
on the.

173
00:13:13,110 --> 00:13:19,800
So remember we had talked a little bit about threads before so if we're doing something that should

174
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:25,080
be run in the background in order not to block the user interface.

175
00:13:25,170 --> 00:13:29,520
Let me come over here and see the documentation as well.

176
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:35,060
And we have done this with countdown timer so we run this on the background track.

177
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:36,150
Remember.

178
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:42,510
And in here these authentication method is running on the background is being run on the background

179
00:13:42,510 --> 00:13:43,800
automatically.

180
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:51,540
But since we want to change the label or since we want to go to power from Segway we should do that

181
00:13:51,810 --> 00:14:01,270
in a main thread rather than background thread or as this can or will actually crash as we have seen

182
00:14:01,270 --> 00:14:02,330
in here.

183
00:14:02,340 --> 00:14:09,690
So we have to make sure that the stuff that performs Segway or this soft out my labeled a tax should

184
00:14:09,690 --> 00:14:13,720
be run on the main threat rather than background track.

185
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:18,420
But as I said before these old contacts is being run on the background track.

186
00:14:18,450 --> 00:14:27,900
So is there any method to make sure that d if control after if control we go to the main track.

187
00:14:28,680 --> 00:14:35,520
Yes actually there is a way to do that and it gives us as a documentation here.

188
00:14:35,550 --> 00:14:40,410
So it gives us an example to use our in our code like this.

189
00:14:40,410 --> 00:14:45,140
So a few say s that labeled a taxi it will give you an error.

190
00:14:45,210 --> 00:14:48,230
So you have to come over here as say dispatch.

191
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:55,500
Q That's mean that I async so it will run on this on the main track is seen erroneously.

192
00:14:55,500 --> 00:14:56,510
OK.

193
00:14:56,820 --> 00:15:03,660
So rather than calling these on the background track I'm going to call his own the main tracks and in

194
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:11,190
order to do that I'm going to use to dispatch Q and As you can cedes to actually let us go back and

195
00:15:11,190 --> 00:15:17,920
forth between treads and this is where we choose the main or background tracks.

196
00:15:18,030 --> 00:15:23,840
So I'm going to do this as synchrony Asli on the main tracks and here we go.

197
00:15:23,850 --> 00:15:29,240
This is all we wanted to do and we have to do this for the label as well.

198
00:15:29,250 --> 00:15:32,830
So dispatch 2 that's main that N Sync.

199
00:15:33,210 --> 00:15:41,640
And let me cut this and paste it inside this coding block so that's all that's all I wanted to do.

200
00:15:42,450 --> 00:15:47,540
So right now if I click on this a run by then again I will see Bill late.

201
00:15:47,540 --> 00:15:49,810
This face recognition one more time.

202
00:15:49,830 --> 00:15:51,360
So here don't sign in.

203
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,500
Let's come over here to hardware as a matching face.

204
00:15:55,650 --> 00:15:58,080
And as you can see now you're signed in.

205
00:15:58,080 --> 00:16:02,880
We have seen the second wave controller so this works great.

206
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:09,450
So let's go back and do this one more do this one more time and this time I'm going to go for my matching

207
00:16:09,450 --> 00:16:10,260
phase.

208
00:16:10,350 --> 00:16:11,210
And here you go.

209
00:16:11,210 --> 00:16:19,590
We have this error message that is automatically created for us by the face I.D..

210
00:16:19,830 --> 00:16:23,610
And as you can see we see the error label as well.

211
00:16:23,610 --> 00:16:25,600
So everything seems to be working.

212
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:27,140
And that's how we leverage.

213
00:16:27,150 --> 00:16:32,100
That's how we utilize face recognition in our apps.

214
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:37,980
So let's stop here and within the next lecture we're going to see what a gift is.
