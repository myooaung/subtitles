00:00:00.660 --> 00:00:07.740
Hi we didn't this lecture we're going to see how we can retrieve information from the five year star

2
00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:08.970
database.

3
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.910
So far we have created our feed we have controller.

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.030
All we have to do is get the information from database and a sign to those views.

5
00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.500
So in here we have our documents right.

6
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:26.160
All we have to do is just find a way to get those documents.

7
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:34.320
So if you go to the documentation and if we click on the U.S. we can see how to get those values from

8
00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:37.500
the five year star database as usual.

9
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:44.610
So in the left hand side we see the court file your store and in here we have the read data.

10
00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.340
So let me click on this.

11
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:50.760
Get Data was and as you can see we have two options.

12
00:00:50.880 --> 00:00:57.480
We can use this get data once in order to get this data for one time only.

13
00:00:57.480 --> 00:00:57.840
Okay.

14
00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:04.560
And this is gets document and we can have another option as well.

15
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:12.960
We can change for we can listen for changing values so we can listen for real time updates.

16
00:01:12.990 --> 00:01:22.440
So if you click over here you will see that rather than saying get a document we say at snapshot listener

17
00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:22.940
in here.

18
00:01:22.970 --> 00:01:32.220
So it listens for changes and if it sees any change in the database so it makes us aware of the need

19
00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:36.750
values so that we can update our views in real time.

20
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:38.620
So let me show you how it's done.

21
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:42.020
We have to create a new function in here.

22
00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:48.120
And in fact we don't have to create this function but it would be much better because it's going to

23
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:50.730
be some kind of long function.

24
00:01:50.810 --> 00:01:53.070
And I don't want to feel a poll.

25
00:01:53.100 --> 00:01:54.990
We did load with this.

26
00:01:54.990 --> 00:02:01.520
So I'm going to create does get data from file your store and write related coding here.

27
00:02:01.530 --> 00:02:08.400
So I'm going to create my five star database so it's going to get from fire started on fire store about

28
00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.320
of course in order to do that.

29
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:13.620
I have to import fire your base in this feed.

30
00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:15.190
We have controller as well.

31
00:02:15.270 --> 00:02:15.740
Right.

32
00:02:16.230 --> 00:02:18.930
So this is the same thing as we did before.

33
00:02:18.930 --> 00:02:22.570
So far you saw that fire sir.

34
00:02:22.590 --> 00:02:28.510
So now I can use this database to add a snapshot listener here.

35
00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:36.170
And in order to do that you can say Forester database dot and you have to specify the collection.

36
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:37.100
OK.

37
00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:42.250
Remember what our collection was we're using posts.

38
00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:45.960
And after that you can add the snapshot listener.

39
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:55.770
But before we move on to that I just want to show you a setting related to field value dot server timestamp.

40
00:02:55.770 --> 00:03:03.370
So previously we had to do this we had to create a settings for five star database.

41
00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:04.470
OK.

42
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:12.450
And then in the settings we have to say settings dot set timestamp in snapshots enabled.

43
00:03:12.930 --> 00:03:21.030
So as you can see this is now deprecated meaning that we don't currently use this but in any case I

44
00:03:21.030 --> 00:03:29.070
just wanted to show you if you get any error regarding to field value that timestamp maybe you may want

45
00:03:29.070 --> 00:03:35.590
to implement this so that you don't get any crash or error later on.

46
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:44.520
But for right now as you can see we're not no longer using this because it's currently coming to as

47
00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:45.420
default.

48
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:45.880
OK.

49
00:03:46.140 --> 00:03:53.910
So this is true by default and we don't have to implement this but if we had to we can just say for

50
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:58.170
your store database not settings is settings.

51
00:03:58.290 --> 00:04:05.040
OK but I'm not going to do that anymore so I'm going to comment this out like this.

52
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:05.880
Okay.

53
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:17.940
Slash star star slash so it won't get run but I just wanted to show you just in case and after debt

54
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:23.110
we have to say fi your star database not collection.

55
00:04:23.110 --> 00:04:27.150
We're going to get our data from a specific collection.

56
00:04:27.720 --> 00:04:31.000
And as you know our collection is posts.

57
00:04:31.230 --> 00:04:35.670
So if you say data collection let's go back to our database.

58
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:41.980
We to say posts and then you can just say add snapshot listener.

59
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:44.550
OK so this is what we want.

60
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:50.340
This is we how we get the query snapshot.

61
00:04:50.340 --> 00:04:55.680
BLOCK And you're going to see what a query snapshot is.

62
00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.440
If you hit enter you will see that we get either a snapshot or an error.

63
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.980
So you can write snapshot or a ring here and we're going to start by checking to see if error is not

64
00:05:08.980 --> 00:05:09.690
nil.

65
00:05:09.700 --> 00:05:16.770
Of course if it's not Neil I'm going to print the error or you can just create an alert message as well.

66
00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:26.740
OK and else if this is not they'll if this is actually Neil it means that we get a snapshot.

67
00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:30.670
So what is a snapshot if you write snapshot.

68
00:05:30.670 --> 00:05:34.960
You will see that this is a quirky snapshot type object.

69
00:05:34.990 --> 00:05:35.980
OK.

70
00:05:36.010 --> 00:05:40.390
And in this snapshot we can find our documents.

71
00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:43.720
That's what we're trying to find right.

72
00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:47.600
So how do we get that document.

73
00:05:47.950 --> 00:05:56.740
If you say snapshot that documents it gives you an array in which you will find query documents snapshots.

74
00:05:56.740 --> 00:06:00.280
So this is actually a collection of documents together.

75
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:07.240
So this contains all of the documents inside of our post collection.

76
00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:14.120
So if we do have for loop in here we can iterate to all these documents one by one.

77
00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:18.030
And that's exactly what we are looking for.

78
00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:24.690
If we were to find another documentary we were to find another snapshot.

79
00:06:24.730 --> 00:06:30.890
We could have just come over here and say something like dots documents.

80
00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:39.310
And if I give a manual string in here like a document I.D. It will just go into that document and I

81
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:45.100
can come over here to say that collection and I can give it another value as well.

82
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:51.490
So whatever level you want to go you have to specify in your coat.

83
00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:55.350
Right now I'm only interested in the documents on their posts.

84
00:06:55.690 --> 00:06:58.290
So I'm leaving it as this.

85
00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:06.030
But if you want to get a specific document for example you can get the document I.D. and the right that

86
00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:13.950
collection pulse that document document idea and it will only bring the value of that current document.

87
00:07:13.960 --> 00:07:20.920
So now we FISA stamp shop that documents I will get my array but before I do that I'm going to check

88
00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:25.270
to see if snapshot that is empty is not true.

89
00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:25.810
OK.

90
00:07:25.810 --> 00:07:30.070
Or is not true or is false.

91
00:07:30.190 --> 00:07:35.820
So I'm going to do this only and only if my snapshot is not empty.

92
00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:43.750
And since we're going to work with this snapshot that documents maybe you may want to add as something

93
00:07:43.750 --> 00:07:46.930
like snapshot is not nil as well.

94
00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:54.970
And I know this is not going to be nil because we're checking for errors as since snapshot is not empty.

95
00:07:54.970 --> 00:07:57.310
Means that snapshot is not nil.

96
00:07:57.310 --> 00:08:04.720
I know but just to be on the safe side I'm being extra cautious here because later on I'm going to loop

97
00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:11.860
through all these documents I'm going to say snapshot of documents and I'm not me I'm not making this

98
00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:14.360
optional I'm just the force are wrapping this.

99
00:08:14.770 --> 00:08:20.480
I can easily do that because I have checked for everything up until this moment.

100
00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:21.580
Right.

101
00:08:21.670 --> 00:08:28.150
So this is not going to be Neil not going to be empty and I'm going to say for document in snapshot

102
00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:29.240
the documents.

103
00:08:29.350 --> 00:08:32.530
So it will give me every document in here.

104
00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:42.250
So this is query document snapshot referring my individual documents right now so I can get any value

105
00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:47.080
from a document I want by saying it's document that gets.

106
00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:52.380
So as you can see document is now is trying to any dictionary.

107
00:08:52.540 --> 00:09:00.910
So this is a real dictionary and I can say dots get and it will give me an optional any object.

108
00:09:00.910 --> 00:09:01.790
OK.

109
00:09:01.930 --> 00:09:08.620
And if I say document I.D. for example I can just get the document ideas as well so I can cast this

110
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.060
to a variable and I can use it later on if I want.

111
00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:18.910
So let me print this for right now and we can see if we are getting the result that we want.

112
00:09:18.910 --> 00:09:21.720
So let me call this from my we did load.

113
00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:22.540
OK.

114
00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:24.820
And they're on it on my simulator.

115
00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:30.790
So if you're working with a different structure over four or five your base file your sir.

116
00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:37.120
All you have to do is just make sure you're getting the right document I.D. and you can use this technique

117
00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:43.990
to check your document I.D. as you can see we have these values and they are the same with these documents.

118
00:09:43.990 --> 00:09:48.370
So I'm sure that I'm getting the right document in here.

119
00:09:48.370 --> 00:09:49.370
OK.

120
00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:58.150
Now I can't process this dictionaries I can pass these dictionaries and get those values and I know

121
00:09:58.180 --> 00:10:06.790
my field values right field names actually I know if I see a document that yet I have to say something

122
00:10:06.790 --> 00:10:10.130
like posted by or post comment.

123
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:17.880
For example let's say posted by it will give me the value of this and it has to be exactly the same

124
00:10:17.890 --> 00:10:18.820
posted by me.

125
00:10:18.820 --> 00:10:26.200
The upper case B in our case and this will be an optional any object.

126
00:10:26.230 --> 00:10:33.460
Remember it gives us an optional edit because we have casted this as any before when we upload these

127
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:34.500
values.

128
00:10:34.690 --> 00:10:43.060
So all we have to do is just optionally cast this to a string and I'm going to use if left to do that.

129
00:10:43.210 --> 00:10:52.120
I'm going to say if LEDs posted by is document that get posted by optionally strings.

130
00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:58.240
OK so if we can do this it means that we're getting our posted by.

131
00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:05.260
So let me print this right now and let me delete this document I.D. so we can just see the posted by

132
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:11.820
values and we're to see James said Metallica dot com because I believe we have done.

133
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:15.660
Both posts with James said Metallica dot com.

134
00:11:16.180 --> 00:11:16.990
And here you go.

135
00:11:16.990 --> 00:11:21.450
We see the user names right now so that's cool.

136
00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.180
So we may proceed with other values as well.

137
00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:32.870
Now we can hear if you want you can do a nested IF statement like we did in the art book.

138
00:11:32.950 --> 00:11:33.920
Okay.

139
00:11:34.570 --> 00:11:38.410
And you can just write everything in here as well.

140
00:11:38.950 --> 00:11:42.740
Or you can just create this if that's one by one.

141
00:11:42.770 --> 00:11:46.830
Within the for loop and it depends on your needs.

142
00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:54.400
So if you want to do everything at once and if you don't want to proceed if you don't get the name you

143
00:11:54.400 --> 00:11:59.330
may want to do this with a nested loop nested if control.

144
00:11:59.350 --> 00:12:06.970
So let me create our arrays first because we need some areas to store those information and then connect

145
00:12:06.970 --> 00:12:14.170
them to our views inside our v S4 table view function right.

146
00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:21.150
So we're going to have a user email user comments and remember our like array will be an integer array.

147
00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:28.220
It's not string OK and what else do we have we have an imager.

148
00:12:28.270 --> 00:12:28.930
Right.

149
00:12:29.020 --> 00:12:36.460
We have a user imagery and it's going to be a string right now because we're only getting the URL strings

150
00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:38.360
from the server.

151
00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.470
And again I believe we're done here.

152
00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:51.070
So let me go over this and just say soft dots appends not to advance of that user email dot that pens

153
00:12:51.310 --> 00:12:53.710
posted by.

154
00:12:53.710 --> 00:12:54.910
So that's it.

155
00:12:55.030 --> 00:12:59.020
And I will proceed with other values in here as well.

156
00:12:59.050 --> 00:13:04.900
So the next thing would be for me to run the If led one more time I'd rather done.

157
00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:06.460
Posted by.

158
00:13:06.460 --> 00:13:09.230
We may just get the post comment.

159
00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:12.330
OK so let me say he fled.

160
00:13:12.370 --> 00:13:20.170
I remember we can do this inside of this if left as though for just variety I'm doing this in here.

161
00:13:20.200 --> 00:13:28.600
In your case you may want to go for nested if statements and let's go for let's see.

162
00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:29.500
Post Comment.

163
00:13:29.530 --> 00:13:36.960
OK if that post comment is a document that gets so this one.

164
00:13:37.030 --> 00:13:42.970
Yep that's GATS and this is post comment as well with that uppercase C..

165
00:13:43.180 --> 00:13:49.810
I'm going to cast his optionally as string as well and then I'm going to add this to my user commentary

166
00:13:50.200 --> 00:13:53.550
and say that append post comments.

167
00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:54.220
Here you go.

168
00:13:54.220 --> 00:14:00.400
Now I'm going to say if that's like Arie or let's say likes.

169
00:14:00.400 --> 00:14:04.040
If let's likes document that gets OK.

170
00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:11.370
This one that gets likes am going to cast this as an integer design.

171
00:14:11.410 --> 00:14:12.960
OK.

172
00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.150
Because we have saved this as an integer remember.

173
00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:24.670
So let's go and say soft like or a dot appends and it asks us to append an integer as well so I'm going

174
00:14:24.670 --> 00:14:26.720
to say he likes.

175
00:14:26.770 --> 00:14:30.780
And finally we have the image array as well right.

176
00:14:30.820 --> 00:14:32.320
So let's do that.

177
00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:43.040
I'm going to say if let's image or a Nazi imagery if let's image document dots let's say image here.

178
00:14:43.060 --> 00:14:46.330
Because it's not image it's just an image URL.

179
00:14:46.410 --> 00:14:47.130
OK.

180
00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:53.280
So you document dot yet image euro.

181
00:14:53.330 --> 00:14:54.170
OK.

182
00:14:54.370 --> 00:14:55.640
As String.

183
00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:00.220
So I'm going to punt this to my string Gary as well.

184
00:15:00.220 --> 00:15:11.620
User imagery dot appends and image euro after we're done with this for loop I'm going to call my table

185
00:15:11.620 --> 00:15:17.160
view and reload the data so I'm going to refresh my table to you as usual.

186
00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:18.230
So say soft.

187
00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:20.130
Table view dot reload data.

188
00:15:20.350 --> 00:15:21.530
Okay.

189
00:15:21.850 --> 00:15:30.070
And after doing that this information will get reflected to the table view so that we can see them on

190
00:15:30.070 --> 00:15:31.710
our table view.

191
00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:33.210
So far so good.

192
00:15:33.220 --> 00:15:41.020
In order to show Doe's information to the user I believe you have to do one last thing and that's changing

193
00:15:41.020 --> 00:15:47.270
this number of rousing section and make it's this one equal to user email array.

194
00:15:47.290 --> 00:15:48.870
That's count.

195
00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:49.990
OK.

196
00:15:50.080 --> 00:15:56.700
And in here rather than saying user at email com let's say user email array.

197
00:15:56.710 --> 00:16:00.280
OK this one an index path.

198
00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:07.710
Doctorow and this will take everything from the user email array and display it to the user.

199
00:16:07.750 --> 00:16:12.170
So for like label I'm going to go for likes like array.

200
00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:15.690
Yep this one like array index path.

201
00:16:15.730 --> 00:16:17.420
Dot row.

202
00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:23.550
And of course this will give me an integer and that's not what I want because I want to text.

203
00:16:23.620 --> 00:16:26.670
So let me convert this to be a string.

204
00:16:27.610 --> 00:16:31.970
And then later on I'm going to go for comment as well.

205
00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:39.350
And this is going to give me a string so I don't have to do anything so user comment array index path.

206
00:16:39.370 --> 00:16:47.430
That row and later on we have to find a way to download images from the Urals and show it inside of

207
00:16:47.430 --> 00:16:49.170
our image view.

208
00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.950
But I'm going to skip it for right now we're going to do that in the next lecture.

209
00:16:53.950 --> 00:17:02.260
So let's test all the other information and run this and as you can see we only have two values we have

210
00:17:02.260 --> 00:17:11.570
two posts so we have my favorite comment test too like button like count and everything in here.

211
00:17:11.770 --> 00:17:13.270
So far so good.

212
00:17:13.300 --> 00:17:17.310
We only are missing the image right now.

213
00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:24.840
So we have to come up with a way to download those images and show them to the user in our image views.

214
00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:28.690
So that's exactly what we going to do within the next lecture.
