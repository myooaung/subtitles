Hi.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:09.960
Doing this cars I'm going to share everything rewrite with you via a web site called GitHub dot com.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:15.630
So this is basically where we share our codes where we share our projects where we collaborate with

4
00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:17.250
each other.

5
00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:21.420
I'm going to share these codes changes projects with you.

6
00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:26.640
So if you want you can download this on your own computer and run it.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:36.300
But I actually do not recommend that I actually recommend you to create these projects with me and write

8
00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:40.860
this code with me one by one minute by minute.

9
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:48.570
But if you want you can just download the zip from here and you can go to your downloads and you can

10
00:00:48.570 --> 00:00:52.460
just double click on the projects like this.

11
00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:52.840
OK.

12
00:00:52.860 --> 00:00:57.810
Let me find that if you double click on the project it will pop open.

13
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:05.290
If you say open and you can reach the codes from here but again I don't recommend that.

14
00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:10.510
I just want you to use those codes as a reference.

15
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:11.320
What do I mean.

16
00:01:11.330 --> 00:01:16.870
You can come over here and you can see the code from the github actually.

17
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:21.540
You can click on this my first app and you can see the view controller files.

18
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:28.890
So if you get stuck at some point you can compare your codes with mine and you can see if you're making

19
00:01:28.890 --> 00:01:31.330
a mistake or not.

20
00:01:31.410 --> 00:01:35.490
And again you can reach those files any time you want.

21
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.980
I'm going to include project links for every section that we have.

22
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:42.380
Don't worry about it.

23
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:44.310
But I would come on.

24
00:01:44.350 --> 00:01:50.310
You do what I do on your own computer because that's best way to learn.

25
00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:57.710
So let's stop here and continue within the next section where we're going to learn about the swift basics.
