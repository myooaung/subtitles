Hi within this section regrouping to build an image recognition app and in order to use this regrouping

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.730
to use machine learning models and of course before we do that we have to learn what machine learning

3
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:17.320
is and what a model is.

4
00:00:17.580 --> 00:00:21.780
In order to do that let's go to developer dot apple dot com.

5
00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:30.770
I'm very gonna be searching some framework called car and owl so come over here to search bar a right

6
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:37.950
car I'm out and you will see the first result that we're going to get is the core amount and this is

7
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:44.190
a framework that lets us integrate machine learning models in our app.

8
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:48.670
So we're going to be seeing what this is.

9
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:50.950
So click on this car IMO.

10
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.700
And we going to see the documentation.

11
00:00:54.630 --> 00:01:05.070
So actually in machine learning we create models and we train these models to teach them about the subject.

12
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.960
For example we can create a model and teach that model how to recognize an image like if we show the

13
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:15.110
monkey image to a model.

14
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.130
It can say that yep this is probably a monkey.

15
00:01:19.230 --> 00:01:19.680
Okay.

16
00:01:20.430 --> 00:01:25.830
And in this section in fact we're not going to be training models.

17
00:01:25.830 --> 00:01:32.400
We're not going gonna be creating models but we're going to use open source models to integrate our

18
00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:39.210
apps so that we can leverage this technique Teague in order to create what we want.

19
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:48.660
And if you want to learn further about training models if you want to first learn about artificial intelligence

20
00:01:48.660 --> 00:01:57.750
or machine learning I believe this is another cautious subject like maybe you want to work with Python.

21
00:01:57.900 --> 00:02:05.850
That's much more convenient programming language to work on machine learning models than Swift but thanks

22
00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:14.160
to Apple we can use those man models in swift in order to create some machine learning apps.

23
00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:19.440
So in here we are going to create an image recognition app and we're going to do exactly what I have

24
00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:26.860
told you regarding to show this model and monkey image and it will say US yep this is probably a monkey.

25
00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:28.280
OK.

26
00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:35.580
So if you come over this documentation you will see some necessary first steps to take in order to create

27
00:02:35.580 --> 00:02:37.690
this kind of application.

28
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:44.490
And in here you will see something like integrating a core amount model into your app and getting your

29
00:02:44.490 --> 00:02:50.160
core demand model and converting these models to core a mouth framework.

30
00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:50.990
OK.

31
00:02:51.150 --> 00:03:01.710
And we going to start by finding a related model for our app under actually good open source models.

32
00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:09.150
If you click over here to getting core and mount model and in here you will see something like models.

33
00:03:09.180 --> 00:03:09.930
OK.

34
00:03:09.930 --> 00:03:13.440
And if you click on that it will take you to this website.

35
00:03:13.470 --> 00:03:16.380
This is machine learning slash models.

36
00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:17.210
OK.

37
00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:23.730
And don't worry I'm going to upload this model to my github account as well you can download it from

38
00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:24.350
here.

39
00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:32.700
You can find the link at the end of the section but I suggest you come over here and take a look at

40
00:03:32.700 --> 00:03:33.940
these models.

41
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:42.270
For example we have some image classification mock modelling here called mobile Net V2 and we have other

42
00:03:42.270 --> 00:03:43.560
models as well.

43
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:49.800
But we're going to be working with this one in this cause like we have the squeeze that we have these

44
00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:53.490
rights not they're all image classification models.

45
00:03:53.790 --> 00:03:54.720
OK.

46
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:00.720
And we have other models here as well like a drawing classification but we're going to focus on this

47
00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:02.420
image classification.

48
00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.650
If you click over here you will see some options off this model.

49
00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:12.420
And we're going to see what these options stand for later on.

50
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:17.750
But for right now no that's where you're going to be working with this mobile Net V2.

51
00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:23.450
And in fact you can work with other models like resonate or screws net as well.

52
00:04:23.550 --> 00:04:30.570
They will all work in the way that I will show you because we are going to see how to work with machine

53
00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:32.990
learning models in general.

54
00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:33.900
OK.

55
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.370
So that's what we're going to build in this section.

56
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:38.790
Now let's stop here.

57
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:42.390
And then in the next lecture we're going to start creating Gover app.
