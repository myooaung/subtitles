00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:01.140
Hi.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:07.560
We didn't his lecture we going to bring in the boxes and re going to give them physics attributes as

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:08.580
well.

4
00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:11.250
So let me tidy up here a little bit.

5
00:00:11.280 --> 00:00:15.590
I'm going to write birth here because we doing bird operations.

6
00:00:15.690 --> 00:00:22.410
And let me cut this and paste over here because we're going to do the soft out physics by the NSF stop

7
00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.860
other operations in here.

8
00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:29.920
So this is related to physics by the or the scene physics body.

9
00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:30.800
OK.

10
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:38.760
And under here we're going to do the box operations so I'm going to create five boxes over here.

11
00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:44.970
First of which box one this is going to be in this case bright note and again a box too.

12
00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:47.630
This is again in this case bright note.

13
00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:53.090
We're going to do that for Box Tree as case bright note.

14
00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:55.880
And let me create box 4.

15
00:00:55.930 --> 00:00:58.810
This is again in this case bright note.

16
00:00:58.810 --> 00:01:03.560
And finally we have this box five as case bright note.

17
00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:06.270
So let me come over here.

18
00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:06.750
OK.

19
00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:15.850
Let me close this down and come over here and let's write the box as we did in the previous lecture.

20
00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:19.920
So I'm going to say box one is a child's note right.

21
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:28.280
So Box 1 is actually a child node and the node name that I'm looking for is the box one again.

22
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:37.000
And I'm going to first cast is as to be as s case for I note after doing that I can give the physics

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.130
body.

24
00:01:38.140 --> 00:01:39.460
Now how do I do that.

25
00:01:39.460 --> 00:01:46.890
I have to go for escape physics buddy and this will ask me for some size and we're not going to go for

26
00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:48.740
radius this time.

27
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:55.090
We're going to go for a rectangle because remember our bucks actually looks like a rectangle in this

28
00:01:55.090 --> 00:01:57.160
case.

29
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:06.460
So we have to create the texture to get the size of this rectangle and I'm going to call SDK texture

30
00:02:06.490 --> 00:02:09.600
and it will ask me for an Image Name.

31
00:02:09.610 --> 00:02:10.260
OK.

32
00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:14.950
This one image named and I believe our name is Brick.

33
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:18.790
Yep this is the one that's come over here and right.

34
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:19.900
Brick.

35
00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.410
So this will give us the texture and we need it size.

36
00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:31.510
So right now we have to get the video and we have to get the height as in the previous lecture.

37
00:02:31.510 --> 00:02:36.780
We only got the radius but this time we have to get the width and height.

38
00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:44.260
So let's say something like Box texture K or C size first of all.

39
00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:51.610
And in the vets section we are going to get the box texture that size not that again.

40
00:02:51.610 --> 00:02:58.570
And in here we only got the size that height but it won't work at this point because we have a width

41
00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:01.260
and we have the height.

42
00:03:01.270 --> 00:03:04.940
So let's go for box texture that size.

43
00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:05.740
OK.

44
00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:12.340
Dot width so this will give me the width and I'm going to divide it by five.

45
00:03:12.370 --> 00:03:19.360
So if that's too much or if that's too low we're going to adjust it later on I'm going to do the same

46
00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:20.360
thing in here.

47
00:03:20.410 --> 00:03:23.880
I'm going to get the height and divide it by five.

48
00:03:25.210 --> 00:03:29.870
So after Dad I'm going to go over here and say size.

49
00:03:30.130 --> 00:03:31.960
Now we have the physics body.

50
00:03:31.960 --> 00:03:35.250
Now I'm going to do what we have been doing so far.

51
00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.250
So this is going to be dynamic.

52
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:38.850
Right.

53
00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:40.320
So this is true.

54
00:03:40.510 --> 00:03:45.280
And again the physics body that's affected by gravity.

55
00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:45.830
Yep.

56
00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:47.100
This is true as well.

57
00:03:47.110 --> 00:03:50.020
This will be affected by gravity.

58
00:03:50.170 --> 00:03:54.220
So do I need the mass over here.

59
00:03:54.220 --> 00:04:02.930
Yes actually we need a mass but we have to figure out something much more important than the mass V.

60
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:09.400
We can't give it the mass and we will think about it in a minute but before giving a mass I'm going

61
00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.800
to say a closer rotation.

62
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:16.860
So this will actually low our boxes to rotate.

63
00:04:16.870 --> 00:04:20.110
So when a bird hits them they will rotate.

64
00:04:20.110 --> 00:04:22.840
They will roll over and fall over.

65
00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:25.610
And it's what we want.

66
00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:26.050
Right.

67
00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:27.840
We want something dynamic.

68
00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:31.430
We want something rolling and we want something rotating.

69
00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:41.160
So let's give the mass and I'm going to go for something like 0 point 5 or 1 kg or 0 point 4.

70
00:04:41.290 --> 00:04:48.550
So it doesn't matter we just going to try it and if that's too much we go to adjust it later on we cannot

71
00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:52.110
know the mass of the box yet.

72
00:04:52.150 --> 00:04:57.940
So let me copy and paste is five times so that we can just do it for bucks too.

73
00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:00.110
OK so this is a box too.

74
00:05:00.190 --> 00:05:11.980
And this is for Box Tree and we're going to do the same thing for Box four and finally box five so five

75
00:05:11.980 --> 00:05:21.290
five five and five and accidently I copy that like six times so let me let this.

76
00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:27.550
And of course we going to have to just change this to be box three four and five.

77
00:05:27.550 --> 00:05:28.450
Here you go.

78
00:05:28.450 --> 00:05:31.550
Now we have all of this.

79
00:05:31.990 --> 00:05:34.910
So in fact let's go and test.

80
00:05:35.190 --> 00:05:37.160
And see if we made it right.

81
00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:42.030
Because we have to adjust the physics bodies as well.

82
00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:43.910
And here you go.

83
00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:45.800
As you can see it works.

84
00:05:45.810 --> 00:05:51.690
But there are some spaces over here and we cannot see the ground properly so it's not related to birth

85
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.050
at all.

86
00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:59.280
And we're going to have to take care of that problem right now because it's blocking the way that we

87
00:05:59.280 --> 00:06:00.360
work.

88
00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:07.680
So let me try to make this a little bit smaller like this and see if it works and if it doesn't.

89
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:12.720
I believe we have some scaling problem and we're going to take care of that again.

90
00:06:13.320 --> 00:06:14.910
And here you go it doesn't work.

91
00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:17.840
So I believe it's a scaling problem.

92
00:06:17.910 --> 00:06:21.050
I'm going to show you how to solve this as well.

93
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:24.120
So far we cannot see the base.

94
00:06:24.180 --> 00:06:26.280
So I'm going to take this back.

95
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:30.840
I'm going to make this the way it used to be again.

96
00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:32.220
OK so this one.

97
00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:40.470
And as you can see it now covers all the screen one more time but I'm going to change the scale type

98
00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:48.810
of my scene so remember in the images we have something called content type and we have either aspect

99
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:53.400
field or aspect fit maybe you remembered that.

100
00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.530
And in here we have the same thing.

101
00:06:56.550 --> 00:07:05.270
So if you come over here to your physics body and if you call s that scene you can actually change its

102
00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:10.440
scale type and you can set it to be aspect fit.

103
00:07:10.530 --> 00:07:11.870
So I'm going to do this.

104
00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:15.340
So I'm going to say self that scene OK.

105
00:07:15.390 --> 00:07:20.150
I'm referring to my scene over here and scene that scale mode.

106
00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:29.250
So this scale modes will get the value of aspect fit or aspect feel as you can see if you say that you

107
00:07:29.250 --> 00:07:33.470
can see the other options I'm going to go for aspect fit.

108
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:38.760
And once we do that you will see our base problem we'll get a result.

109
00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:39.650
Here we go.

110
00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:45.200
Now we can see the bottom of the birth and bottom of our base as well.

111
00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:48.410
And now we only have this problem.

112
00:07:48.590 --> 00:07:55.620
That's our physics body for our boxes are actually bigger than it should be because they look like it's

113
00:07:55.630 --> 00:08:00.120
full they're floating over the air but we don't want that.

114
00:08:00.120 --> 00:08:03.510
So let's change it a little bit.

115
00:08:03.510 --> 00:08:11.410
For example let's divide it by six rather than five and try it and see if that works for us.

116
00:08:11.430 --> 00:08:14.790
So let me run this on our simulator one more time.

117
00:08:14.910 --> 00:08:24.210
And here you go now it works fine and it's kind of stacked over each other but it's OK because we're

118
00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:28.060
going to throw some birds over them anyway.

119
00:08:28.170 --> 00:08:30.660
So I believe this is looking good.

120
00:08:31.290 --> 00:08:39.180
So now we brought in the birds we brought in the boxes and we managed to give the physical properties

121
00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:41.080
of these views.

122
00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:47.010
Now what we want to do is to learn how to inmate the bird how to throw the bird how to move the bird

123
00:08:47.010 --> 00:08:50.300
around so that they can collide with it.

124
00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:53.460
That's what we're going to do in the next lecture.
