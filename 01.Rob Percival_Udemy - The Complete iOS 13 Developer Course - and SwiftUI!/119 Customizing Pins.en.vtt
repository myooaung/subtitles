00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:01.310
Hi.

2
00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:08.300
We didn't do a lecture we're going to take care of our problems like not making us come back to control

3
00:00:08.300 --> 00:00:14.120
comptroller lists we have comptroller and adding the data automatically to our table view and the re

4
00:00:14.120 --> 00:00:20.950
going to customize our pin views so that we can add a navigation bottom to our pin views.

5
00:00:20.990 --> 00:00:21.650
Okay.

6
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:29.040
So in order to add the data to our table view regarding to use the notification center in the controller

7
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:36.840
like we did before in the previous section remember we can use notification center center here in order

8
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:43.740
to send a message to the whole app then we can observe this message from anywhere we want in the app

9
00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:46.230
so that we can trigger an action.

10
00:00:46.230 --> 00:00:47.580
So let's go for it.

11
00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:48.490
Let's go.

12
00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:55.230
Notification center dot default dot past and choose the one with the name and the object.

13
00:00:55.230 --> 00:00:59.760
And actually we don't even need an object so we going to call this Neal afterwords.

14
00:00:59.850 --> 00:01:07.290
But for right now I'm going to open parentheses and in the row value I'm gonna say name place and the

15
00:01:07.290 --> 00:01:09.790
object will be nil.

16
00:01:09.810 --> 00:01:10.200
Okay.

17
00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:17.330
I'm just I just want to send a new place message to the whole app so that I can come over my list.

18
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:20.330
We have controller and then observed this message.

19
00:01:20.340 --> 00:01:26.520
And if I see the need place message then I can trigger some function and the function that I will be

20
00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:29.100
triggering is to getting data from the core data.

21
00:01:29.810 --> 00:01:37.050
And in here I can just say navigation controller dots POP V controller and the animated will be true.

22
00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:44.610
So this will bring me back to my list view controller and in the list view controller we had to check

23
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:50.520
for this message but remember we cannot do that in the we did load because we did load only gets called

24
00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:51.530
once.

25
00:01:51.540 --> 00:01:58.230
So I'm going to go for we will appear as usual and in here I'm going to go for a notification center

26
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.170
one more time dot default and rather than posting I'm just observing this sign.

27
00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:11.700
So I'm going to choose this ad observer which has the parameters of observer selector name and object

28
00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:19.050
so observable observer will be s and selector will be as selector function.

29
00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:27.060
Okay I'm going to give get data function we already have that in here all I have to use add at objective

30
00:02:27.060 --> 00:02:32.680
seen here and in the name of course I'm going to go for ad plays.

31
00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:36.870
This has to be exactly the same as we have written before.

32
00:02:36.900 --> 00:02:38.140
So new place.

33
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.330
Okay.

34
00:02:39.420 --> 00:02:41.450
And the object will be nil.

35
00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:46.350
So this will observe this message whenever it gets displayed to the user.

36
00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:51.570
So whenever it sees this it will trigger the get data function.

37
00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:53.300
So let's go and try one.

38
00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:55.130
Let's change the location.

39
00:02:55.140 --> 00:02:58.060
Okay let's go for 48.

40
00:02:58.230 --> 00:03:07.720
So let's say Okay and let's hit on the ad button and I want to come over here to Notre Dame Cathedral.

41
00:03:08.290 --> 00:03:11.340
OK and zoom in a little bit.

42
00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:15.350
And for the name I'm going to go for not rhythm.

43
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:20.210
And for the notes let's just say cancel the rule.

44
00:03:20.400 --> 00:03:21.360
OK.

45
00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:30.810
And then we can hold on here for cheese seconds and will add my pin which we are going to customize

46
00:03:30.810 --> 00:03:31.380
later on.

47
00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:39.180
And here we go and I say save it saves the Notre Dame and we can actually come and look at it later

48
00:03:39.270 --> 00:03:40.030
on.

49
00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.830
So our app is working as it's supposed to be.

50
00:03:43.830 --> 00:03:49.980
And all we have to do is just add a navigation button to our pin view so we can call the navigation

51
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:55.860
when we click on the ad button it still brings us to the current location of the user which is around

52
00:03:55.860 --> 00:03:56.280
here.

53
00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.670
So far so good.

54
00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:01.290
Now I believe it's working fine.

55
00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:08.190
We can see the selected places it's centers around the selected place it doesn't take us to any other

56
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:16.870
place so it's definitely stopping the location manager and it's not of dating the location.

57
00:04:16.950 --> 00:04:18.870
So we are seeing everything.

58
00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:26.340
So now we have to customize this pin to add a button to the right side of the pin so that when we click

59
00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:32.590
on it it will bring a navigation to the selected place.

60
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:34.140
So how do we do that.

61
00:04:34.170 --> 00:04:37.950
Of course we have a prayer built in function for data as well.

62
00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:42.360
We have a function for customizing the pins.

63
00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:50.270
We can use that function in order to design our pins so that if we want a bottom on the pin we can add

64
00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:54.270
it if we want to display a message in the pin we can display it.

65
00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.160
So let me show you how it goes.

66
00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.470
Let me go under it is location manager so if you right.

67
00:05:01.610 --> 00:05:03.460
We have four annotation.

68
00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:03.880
Yeah.

69
00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.450
That's the one we're looking for.

70
00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:05.870
OK.

71
00:05:05.870 --> 00:05:08.100
View for annotation.

72
00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:15.590
So as you can see it asks us to return on M.K. annotation view and it gives us an annotation.

73
00:05:15.590 --> 00:05:20.720
So we're going to use all of these parameters to create our own pin view.

74
00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:25.610
So what we're going to do we going to create a variable here.

75
00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.120
OK.

76
00:05:26.120 --> 00:05:27.650
And this will be our pin view.

77
00:05:27.650 --> 00:05:33.800
So let me create this with var and we're going to drive this from the map view.

78
00:05:33.830 --> 00:05:37.310
And if you say map you that's De Q Okay.

79
00:05:37.430 --> 00:05:39.950
Q reusable annotation view.

80
00:05:39.950 --> 00:05:44.750
So that's the way that's the way we want with identifier.

81
00:05:44.810 --> 00:05:48.870
We don't even need the four you can just go for the first one.

82
00:05:48.950 --> 00:05:52.490
We just want the one with identifier.

83
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:58.400
So this will ask us an identifier and you can write whatever you want to write in here.

84
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.840
Let's create an identifier string in here because it will ask us for a couple of times.

85
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:07.670
Let's say that this is reuse idea for example.

86
00:06:07.670 --> 00:06:14.450
And I'm just going to called is my invitation and if you want you can call this anything you want as

87
00:06:14.450 --> 00:06:19.220
long as you just reuse it anytime you asked for I.D..

88
00:06:19.790 --> 00:06:23.230
I'm going to optionally cast this as M.K. on notation view.

89
00:06:23.650 --> 00:06:32.270
I'm not M.K. annotation of you M.K. pin on notation v OK and it will ask me for to return on M.K. annotation

90
00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:40.580
view but I'm just going to return on M.K. pin annotation view and don't worry that's OK if you say return

91
00:06:40.740 --> 00:06:48.120
pin V right now even though pin view is an M K peanut notation view it will be okay because they're

92
00:06:48.140 --> 00:06:49.990
practically the same thing.

93
00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:58.340
OK now we have created our pin view but we need to make sure to set this up before we go on and return

94
00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.090
this pin view.

95
00:06:59.210 --> 00:07:05.440
OK first thing to check if this pin view is an user location pin V1.

96
00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:11.850
If it's the case I'm not going to return anything because I don't want to pin my user's location.

97
00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:21.020
So a way to do that is just say if a notation is M.K. user on notation and by a notation I'm referring

98
00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:25.700
the annotation that are that is given to me is within the function.

99
00:07:25.700 --> 00:07:26.370
Okay.

100
00:07:26.390 --> 00:07:34.490
And as you can see M.K. user location defines the user's location so if that's the case I'm just going

101
00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:40.970
to return nil I don't want to pinpoint anything regarding my User's location I just want to show a pin

102
00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:43.110
in the selected place.

103
00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:50.900
OK so I'm just going to do this here if that's the case I'm returning nil and if that's not the case

104
00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:59.360
I'm returning my pin view and underpin view let's go for it let's change the pin view first I'm going

105
00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:08.600
to check to see pin view is nil if pin view is nil I'm going to assign some values to it and if that's

106
00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:14.710
not the if that's not the case I'm just going to return the annotation that is given to me.

107
00:08:14.960 --> 00:08:16.180
So what do I mean.

108
00:08:16.190 --> 00:08:22.880
I'm just going to create my pin view as M.K. pin annotation view and will ask me for an annotation and

109
00:08:22.880 --> 00:08:25.180
that's the annotation that I want to give you.

110
00:08:25.490 --> 00:08:26.210
OK.

111
00:08:26.240 --> 00:08:31.660
And the reuse identifier will be the one that I have created before.

112
00:08:31.700 --> 00:08:39.650
It doesn't matter as long as you use the same reuse identifier in both of this pin views.

113
00:08:39.770 --> 00:08:49.540
OK if we always know I'm creating a new one as you can see and in here I can say can show call out.

114
00:08:49.550 --> 00:08:56.420
So this is a boolean indicating whether the annotation view is able to display an extra information.

115
00:08:56.420 --> 00:08:57.960
So that's what we want.

116
00:08:58.080 --> 00:09:04.190
We're going to display an extra button on the right hand side of our pin view.

117
00:09:04.610 --> 00:09:06.680
So that will be true.

118
00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:11.610
And in here actually we can change the other attributes of the pin view itself.

119
00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:18.080
For example we can change the color of the pin view if we want like you can just go over and hear say

120
00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:26.240
pin we've got tint color is you eye color dots black red blue whatever you want.

121
00:09:26.270 --> 00:09:27.560
OK.

122
00:09:27.620 --> 00:09:36.590
So after doing that I believe we should not waste time or changing any other pin view attributes like

123
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:38.100
color or something.

124
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:39.030
OK.

125
00:09:39.110 --> 00:09:46.700
We can go ahead to add our button to the right hand side of our pin view and in order to do that I I

126
00:09:46.700 --> 00:09:50.750
just have to create button in here with code.

127
00:09:50.750 --> 00:09:55.480
So you know how to do that you can just say let button is a UI button OK.

128
00:09:55.510 --> 00:10:03.940
If you open parentheses it will ask you for a type in here if you hit enter and hit dot you will see

129
00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.510
some other types.

130
00:10:05.530 --> 00:10:12.960
I want detailed disclosure so you will see what I mean by detailed disclosure.

131
00:10:12.970 --> 00:10:17.250
It's kind of an eye I can standing for information.

132
00:10:17.500 --> 00:10:20.050
And if you say pin me your daughter right.

133
00:10:20.050 --> 00:10:22.410
Call out accessory view.

134
00:10:22.510 --> 00:10:25.360
You can make it equal to bottom so right.

135
00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:29.350
Call out accessory view is the way that we are looking for.

136
00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:36.480
Else if being view is not even nil then it means that I can just come over here and say pinwheel that

137
00:10:36.580 --> 00:10:41.640
annotation is the annotation that is given me within the function.

138
00:10:42.590 --> 00:10:44.640
So that's it.

139
00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:51.050
I know it's kind of complicated for you right now because it's the first time you're seeing this if

140
00:10:51.050 --> 00:10:53.330
you just take a look at the code.

141
00:10:53.330 --> 00:10:54.900
It's not even complicated.

142
00:10:54.910 --> 00:10:57.010
You're just creating a pin view.

143
00:10:57.140 --> 00:10:58.640
And here you go.

144
00:10:58.640 --> 00:11:03.030
Now we have our pin view in the Notre Dame Cather.

145
00:11:03.260 --> 00:11:07.610
So if you click on this pin view it will display this right.

146
00:11:07.610 --> 00:11:14.270
Call out accessory view and it's a disclosure button detailed disclosure by them so we can click on

147
00:11:14.270 --> 00:11:14.750
this.

148
00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:21.260
Of course nothing happens right then because we haven't written it yet but this is the detailed disclosure

149
00:11:21.310 --> 00:11:28.120
button and we have written all of these codes in order to add this button to our pin views.

150
00:11:28.190 --> 00:11:35.350
And in order to show you exactly how to customize a pin view if you need one any day.

151
00:11:35.420 --> 00:11:36.640
So let's stop here.

152
00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:42.140
And within the next lecture we're going to add navigation by me click on that button.
