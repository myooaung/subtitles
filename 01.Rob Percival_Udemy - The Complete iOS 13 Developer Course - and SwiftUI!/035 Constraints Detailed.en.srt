00:00:00,730 --> 00:00:01,420
Hi.

2
00:00:01,500 --> 00:00:07,440
We didn't dislike your reading to focus on details of constraints and we're going to see how we can

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,280
change the constraints that we have previously added.

4
00:00:10,770 --> 00:00:17,940
If you click one of these constraints you will see them highlighting as you might remember we have to

5
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:25,800
decrease this 58 number because it pushes the label from each side so it doesn't fit in the current

6
00:00:26,120 --> 00:00:26,720
layout.

7
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,350
So I'm going to go for 10 instead of 58.

8
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:31,140
CAN I DO THAT.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:31,880
YEAH SURE.

10
00:00:31,890 --> 00:00:34,810
JUST COME HERE AND CHANGE THE CONSTANT.

11
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:35,690
Right.

12
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,940
So right now the left constraints and the right constraints of this project layout label is 10.

13
00:00:44,130 --> 00:00:50,430
So in here I can see the order add to which the output constrains attributes as well.

14
00:00:50,460 --> 00:00:57,730
So let me click one of these as you can see it connects the metal cage Apex top to the project like

15
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:08,910
layouts bottom and this one connects the project layouts top to the iPhone's safe area top and I can't

16
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:11,340
change that from here actually.

17
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:14,610
So let me zoom in so you can't see better.

18
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:21,020
So this is Project layout and it starts at the top as you can see and this is safe area.

19
00:01:21,010 --> 00:01:29,760
And by safe area it means that the upper bound of this iPhone X or iPhone X are okay.

20
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:39,870
So as you can see if I click on this this is the safe area and it connects the safe area up to the top

21
00:01:39,870 --> 00:01:44,310
of these labels so I can't change this.

22
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:46,500
I can't change I can say that.

23
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:48,770
Don't connect this to the top.

24
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:55,550
Just connect this to the bottom of the project layout for example or center of the project layout.

25
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:04,170
If I choose this as you can see go for bottom and it connects the safe area to the bottom of the project

26
00:02:04,170 --> 00:02:05,710
layout.

27
00:02:05,710 --> 00:02:12,030
And again this doesn't make sense it makes sense to connect this to the top of the project layer.

28
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,000
I'm just doing this for an example.

29
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:21,540
But there might be some cases where you want this to be connected to the center or to the top so you

30
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:23,340
can change it over here.

31
00:02:23,370 --> 00:02:29,540
You can't change the constants values over here as well as you can see.

32
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:31,600
So this is now OK.

33
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,780
And in here I believe the choice of the metallic image was not good.

34
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:42,910
So it doesn't look good in big Image view like this.

35
00:02:42,930 --> 00:02:51,360
So maybe we can go for some other content modes in order to see the actual size of this image view like

36
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:52,140
this.

37
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,280
OK.

38
00:02:53,310 --> 00:02:58,890
So it actually starts a little below from the project lay out.

39
00:02:58,950 --> 00:02:59,310
OK.

40
00:02:59,310 --> 00:03:02,910
So this constraint actually works.

41
00:03:02,910 --> 00:03:11,610
So this is five or eight so maybe we can do it something like 10 or 20 I don't know but it looks good

42
00:03:11,610 --> 00:03:20,810
to me and we have the right and left constraints as well so we can see all image inside of iPhone AC

43
00:03:20,820 --> 00:03:22,080
and iPhone X are.

44
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:29,600
So I'm going to change it back to aspect fit or maybe you can just leave it like this.

45
00:03:29,610 --> 00:03:31,800
Maybe this is the view you want.

46
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:33,420
I don't know.

47
00:03:33,420 --> 00:03:42,300
And I believe this is actually better to use because we can see the image views actual size in this

48
00:03:42,300 --> 00:03:43,690
mode.

49
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:50,760
And let me click on this and let me try to increase this constant as you might see when I increase the

50
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,840
Metallica image goes down a little bit.

51
00:03:53,850 --> 00:03:56,760
If I decrease Metallica image goes up a little bit.

52
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,690
So in real time it makes these adjustments.

53
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:03,600
So again I can change this.

54
00:04:03,600 --> 00:04:05,180
For example I can do top.

55
00:04:05,190 --> 00:04:13,680
So it connects the top of this image view to the bottom of these labels or top of this label and of

56
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:21,030
course this doesn't make sense but in some cases may be you may want to use them at the point that I'm

57
00:04:21,180 --> 00:04:22,530
trying to make here.

58
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:33,630
After you actually add this constants at these constraints because in a real complicated app you will

59
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:41,760
have to spend much time adjusting these constraints in order to have a better looking app.

60
00:04:42,270 --> 00:04:47,110
So you need to be comfortable to work on these constraints.

61
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:47,490
OK.

62
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:51,540
So we have a priority number over here.

63
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:58,920
So it really means priority when it comes 1000 as a default value.

64
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:04,870
Let me show you let me try and show you what these priorities do.

65
00:05:05,660 --> 00:05:13,640
So when I add one constraint and when I add another constraint if they actually conflict with each other

66
00:05:13,970 --> 00:05:15,620
we choose some priorities.

67
00:05:15,620 --> 00:05:22,330
So let me add one more constrained to the right hand side of this image and make this twelve.

68
00:05:22,820 --> 00:05:30,740
So I have two constraints connected connecting the right side of this image to the right side of the

69
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:31,320
form.

70
00:05:31,490 --> 00:05:34,120
So one is ten and the other one is 20.

71
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:39,560
And as you can see we are seeing some rad constraints over here.

72
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:42,650
It isn't a good sign it means there is an error.

73
00:05:42,650 --> 00:05:43,570
OK.

74
00:05:43,640 --> 00:05:47,550
So we have to of course this doesn't make sense.

75
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:57,590
It doesn't make sense to use two like this but if I change the priority to 9 9 9 it means that I try

76
00:05:57,590 --> 00:06:02,990
to leverage try to execute this too.

77
00:06:03,170 --> 00:06:06,230
And if it fails if one fails.

78
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:10,220
Tried to go with the prioritized one.

79
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:10,560
OK.

80
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:14,560
So it's going to go with the ten instead of twelve.

81
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:15,810
In this case.

82
00:06:16,010 --> 00:06:23,780
So maybe if you want to add two constraints and if they overlap or if they conflict you will have to

83
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,630
create a priority.

84
00:06:25,820 --> 00:06:33,500
So you will D prioritize one so that the other one will be prioritized whenever there's a conflict.

85
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,780
And it will be in place.

86
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:39,040
So this is how it looks like.

87
00:06:39,140 --> 00:06:39,930
OK.

88
00:06:40,070 --> 00:06:47,390
You learned about this but there is still to learn about something as you can see there is a width and

89
00:06:47,390 --> 00:06:49,700
height constraint in here.

90
00:06:49,700 --> 00:06:50,790
And we haven't seen.

91
00:06:50,810 --> 00:06:58,340
For example let me add that height and as you can see it adds a linear vertical line in here means that

92
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:08,660
whenever or wherever I run this image wherever I run this app regardless of the screen size it will

93
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,070
have this height.

94
00:07:10,450 --> 00:07:11,390
OK.

95
00:07:11,450 --> 00:07:21,920
So if you want some really strict images a really strict weave like this has to be 50 by 50 or this

96
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:24,790
has to be 100 to 100.

97
00:07:24,860 --> 00:07:28,960
You can go for the width and height constraints.

98
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,090
OK.

99
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:36,140
And this will come in handy when you experience some problems with the constraints.

100
00:07:36,290 --> 00:07:40,970
Sometimes we happen to come across in a situation like this.

101
00:07:40,970 --> 00:07:46,700
We have to add this we then height in some situations if we add constraints.

102
00:07:46,700 --> 00:07:55,340
And if you cannot see the view after you run the simulator it means that the constraints are suppressants

103
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:56,490
somehow.

104
00:07:56,510 --> 00:08:04,700
So we cannot see the view as you can see when I add the reader in height it regardless of the screen

105
00:08:04,700 --> 00:08:11,180
size it displays all the image in the height that I have specified.

106
00:08:11,180 --> 00:08:18,440
So whenever you come across in a situation in which you can not see the view itself because of the constraints

107
00:08:18,650 --> 00:08:20,900
try to use the width and height.

108
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:30,170
So it would make these values say tick it will make these values in a strict way so that they will be

109
00:08:30,170 --> 00:08:32,250
executed.

110
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:39,320
And as you can see width and height constraints are shown in the different hierarchy because they belong

111
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:47,270
to Metallica J Pag image views hierarchy rather than the constraints hierarchy.

112
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:50,500
They're like an attribute right now.

113
00:08:50,540 --> 00:08:55,820
So if you want to change them you can reach them under your image view.

114
00:08:56,110 --> 00:08:56,750
OK.

115
00:08:56,960 --> 00:09:03,380
So you can delete actually when you choose a constraint if you do a backspace or delete on your keyboard

116
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:06,520
it will just delete the coal strings.

117
00:09:06,560 --> 00:09:12,920
OK we're going to stop here and within the next lecture we're going to see some easy ways to work with

118
00:09:12,920 --> 00:09:13,820
constraints.
