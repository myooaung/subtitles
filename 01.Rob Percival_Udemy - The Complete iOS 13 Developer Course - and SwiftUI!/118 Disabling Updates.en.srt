00:00:00,910 --> 00:00:01,520
Hi.

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:02,890
We didn't this lecture.

3
00:00:02,940 --> 00:00:09,490
Where are you going to see how we can actually zoom in to the selected landmark from here or selected

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:11,010
travel from here.

5
00:00:11,010 --> 00:00:17,580
For example if we choose the artsy Triumph right now we're showing the annotation but you're not actually

6
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:18,500
zooming in.

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,930
If we had another location like this.

8
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:28,720
Let me go to location and change this and you will see that the map will display whole another location.

9
00:00:28,830 --> 00:00:37,740
So rather than saying 48 let me do this forty nine for example if I hear okay it will show us a completely

10
00:00:37,740 --> 00:00:46,920
different location so that even though I added the notation of the selected place now I cannot even

11
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:49,960
see that annotation in order to do that.

12
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:57,640
I have to disable this location updates so even die I change my place even though I am completely in

13
00:00:57,650 --> 00:01:05,160
a different place then I can still see the arch there trying for I can still see the Eiffel Tower right

14
00:01:05,190 --> 00:01:09,720
now I cannot see it because I'm in a completely different place.

15
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,700
So let's go to location one more time and let's go back to 48.

16
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:22,350
And as you can see if we if we are on the same place that our selected landmark or site took place then

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:25,470
I can't see it and that's not what I want.

18
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:29,870
So what shall we do to make this problem go away.

19
00:01:30,690 --> 00:01:36,330
So here in the location manager we started updating location right.

20
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:44,250
And if we select some other places some other places from the table view then I'm going to come over

21
00:01:44,250 --> 00:01:51,470
here and say stop updating location if I choose a previously created the record.

22
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,990
Now I don't need to get the location at all.

23
00:01:54,990 --> 00:02:02,240
All I just want to show the notation or a selected place to the user on the map.

24
00:02:02,370 --> 00:02:09,030
And furthermore I'm starting to getting location in the wooded lot so I will have the location anyway.

25
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:18,000
So it's not harmful for me to stop updating location because when I start updating location every time

26
00:02:18,360 --> 00:02:25,470
this gets updated this function we'll zoom in to the turn location off the user.

27
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:33,210
So rather than zooming in the current location under here under the annotation I'm going to call what

28
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,120
I have been doing in here.

29
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:41,970
I'm going to create a location I'm going to create this pen and I'm just going to set the region to

30
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,440
the selected place.

31
00:02:44,610 --> 00:02:47,010
So I already have the coordinates right.

32
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:55,230
I already have a location so I can come over here and say let location I let chosen location as your

33
00:02:55,230 --> 00:02:59,670
location coordinate 2D but I have already done that in here.

34
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:02,510
I have this as a coordinate here.

35
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:04,170
So there is no need to do that.

36
00:03:04,170 --> 00:03:12,140
I just I have to just call and create a spend and then I can set a region to show on the map.

37
00:03:12,180 --> 00:03:13,840
So let's do this Ben.

38
00:03:13,890 --> 00:03:16,320
It's will be an M K coordinate spend.

39
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,340
OK.

40
00:03:17,370 --> 00:03:21,940
And this will ask for as ask us for our latitude Delta.

41
00:03:22,020 --> 00:03:26,820
I'm gonna go 4 0 point 0 5 and longitude Delta as well.

42
00:03:27,030 --> 00:03:32,100
And then we can create a region combining these coordinates and spots.

43
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:34,170
So let's say caught in that region.

44
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:34,580
OK.

45
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:41,930
This will ask for us as center so let's give the coordinators a center and let's give the span is a

46
00:03:41,930 --> 00:03:42,750
span.

47
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:50,660
OK and then we can just say not let actually we can just call the map view right.

48
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:55,580
So let's say they let's say that Matthew Dowd sat region.

49
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:56,550
OK.

50
00:03:56,780 --> 00:04:00,890
And let's go to the region here and animated.

51
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:01,580
Why not.

52
00:04:01,610 --> 00:04:03,280
Let's say true.

53
00:04:03,290 --> 00:04:03,950
Here we go.

54
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:12,550
Now this will focus the map view onto the chosen place onto the chosen title.

55
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,910
And Beaver that we're only doing this if the selected title is not empty string.

56
00:04:19,370 --> 00:04:22,180
So it means that we have a selected title.

57
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:26,750
For example if I click on this it will show me my current location anyway.

58
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:29,930
But let me change the current location here.

59
00:04:29,930 --> 00:04:30,280
OK.

60
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:31,870
Let me go to forty nine.

61
00:04:31,880 --> 00:04:33,200
One more time.

62
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,980
So I'm in a different place right now.

63
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:39,900
So if I click the ad button it will show me here.

64
00:04:39,920 --> 00:04:41,270
So this is good.

65
00:04:41,390 --> 00:04:46,520
So if I click on the ad button I can still add a place from my current location.

66
00:04:46,670 --> 00:04:49,940
But I want to see the arch the triumph when I click on it.

67
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:57,920
And as you can see we're not seeing it yet even though we stopped the location updates even though we

68
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:03,240
made sure that we zoomed in to the selected place we cannot say it.

69
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:10,550
Maybe if we try a lot more times like when I click on the Eiffel Tower now I get the result that I want.

70
00:05:10,640 --> 00:05:14,540
But when I click on the arch to triumph it won't show me.

71
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:22,750
And this is a problem that we may experience because we're dealing with some asynchronous tasks in here.

72
00:05:22,790 --> 00:05:28,420
For example we can see these actually trying for right now but before we couldn't see it.

73
00:05:28,430 --> 00:05:34,400
So this is not the behavior that we're looking for we have to be sure many user clicks on one of the

74
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:35,710
selected items.

75
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:38,360
It directly takes us to this screen.

76
00:05:38,420 --> 00:05:44,900
And if the user clicks on the ads button then it will just take us to the current location.

77
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:52,970
So in order to make sure I'm going to come under it as did update locations and if and only if if the

78
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:58,120
selected title is not an empty string I'm just going to disable it.

79
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:58,620
OK.

80
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:08,150
So I'm just going to say if selected title OK if selected title is actually an empty string then do

81
00:06:08,150 --> 00:06:17,990
this else I'm not going to do anything at all because if the selected title is not empty it means that

82
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:20,710
I am trying to show something to the user.

83
00:06:20,710 --> 00:06:28,240
Just don't update my location as you can see if I hit the Add button it still shows me the current place.

84
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:37,370
But now when I go to one of the records that I have previously made it shows me that selected place.

85
00:06:37,370 --> 00:06:39,530
So now it works like a charm.

86
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:44,340
So that's what I have wanted in the first place.

87
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:52,400
So since now we fix this problem I believe we still have something to figure out like when we add a

88
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:53,600
new record.

89
00:06:53,600 --> 00:07:01,580
It doesn't take us back to the lists we have controller and it doesn't display the last added data in

90
00:07:01,580 --> 00:07:03,830
the real controller reel table.

91
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,020
So we had to make sure we fixed that.

92
00:07:06,290 --> 00:07:13,330
And then later on we had to make sure to add a navigation from the current location to the selected

93
00:07:13,340 --> 00:07:14,000
place.

94
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:16,760
Let's do all of those in the following lectures.
