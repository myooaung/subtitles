00:00:00,660 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:07,830
We didn't this lecture were you going to see how to work with data in swift UI and how to create buttons

3
00:00:08,100 --> 00:00:11,360
to create our own actions.

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:19,560
So let's go and open another view because we're going to work in a different view and we have our own

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:21,420
preview so that we can do that.

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:22,970
But I never we won't.

7
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:25,590
So let's go and create the new suite to iView.

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:26,460
Okay.

9
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:37,080
And I'm going to call this fourth view and let's come over here and bring this for you to the top and

10
00:00:37,080 --> 00:00:38,040
on heater is you.

11
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:43,110
So what I want to do in this lecture is to create a variable.

12
00:00:43,380 --> 00:00:44,130
Okay.

13
00:00:44,220 --> 00:00:50,730
And we're going to change that variable for example right now we're displaying Heller wrote inside of

14
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:51,860
that tax.

15
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:57,470
Why if I want to create a variable and display that variable inside of this text.

16
00:00:57,480 --> 00:00:58,800
Can I do that.

17
00:00:58,800 --> 00:00:59,220
Yep.

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:00,240
Of course we can.

19
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:06,890
So make sure you create your rabble under your struct but above your body.

20
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:09,760
And I'm going to call mine my name.

21
00:01:10,040 --> 00:01:10,650
OK.

22
00:01:10,830 --> 00:01:15,770
So my name will be a till then rather than displaying hello world.

23
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:19,940
I'm going to display my name inside of this text.

24
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:24,690
So if I hit resume I will see a tail here.

25
00:01:24,690 --> 00:01:26,350
So this is good.

26
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,030
Now I want to add a bottom and then I hit that button.

27
00:01:31,050 --> 00:01:32,670
The name will change.

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:33,620
OK.

29
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:35,330
Can I do that.

30
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:36,720
Of course we can.

31
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:39,560
Let's see how we can achieve that result.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,300
So I'm going to wrap this around the V stack because we're going to have more than one view.

33
00:01:45,300 --> 00:01:50,700
OK I'm going to have my text and I'm going to have a button.

34
00:01:50,790 --> 00:01:55,870
So if you write button over here you will see the button.

35
00:01:55,980 --> 00:01:56,430
OK.

36
00:01:56,430 --> 00:02:02,640
And if you open parentheses it will ask you for some parameters and the parameters that we are looking

37
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,450
for is the action and the labels.

38
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:13,830
So the action is the actual action if you hit enter over here it will create a coding block for you

39
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:16,090
in which you can write your own code.

40
00:02:16,230 --> 00:02:19,650
And whenever you tap on this button this will happen.

41
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:20,400
OK.

42
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:28,200
We're going to change our my name variable inside of this action and for label for label we generally

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:36,390
just hit enter and write whatever we want inside of that label for example at text or if we just want

44
00:02:36,390 --> 00:02:41,650
to show an image for a button then we can just bring in the image.

45
00:02:41,650 --> 00:02:48,900
But this time if I hit enter it will create a weird coding block for me a closure for me and I don't

46
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,820
need that closure K rather I'm going to delete everything regarding to that closure and I believe I

47
00:02:56,820 --> 00:02:59,710
deleted the currently braces as well.

48
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:08,730
So after the action you can just open your own curly brace and or here you can just write text and just

49
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:12,850
choose your own bottom text like my button.

50
00:03:12,960 --> 00:03:17,780
And as you can see as I type it will appear on the right hand side.

51
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:24,360
And as you can see now we see the button over here and the good thing about this preview is that you

52
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:31,080
can hit this light by them and make your preview live so that you can actually test the actions as well.

53
00:03:31,560 --> 00:03:39,120
So right now I don't have any action but if I had I can just click over that button using this preview

54
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:47,460
rather than opening the simulator and I can just test the actions like navigation like button and everything

55
00:03:47,460 --> 00:03:50,750
inside of this preview.

56
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:53,630
So for example I can hit my button right now.

57
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:56,970
Nothing will happen because I didn't write anything.

58
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,650
So let me give a padding to my text because they are really close to each other and in fact let me just

59
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,690
give some large title to this phone so that we can see the name better.

60
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,360
OK.

61
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:17,110
So this is much better and under my button action I want to change this name.

62
00:04:17,460 --> 00:04:18,160
Right.

63
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:20,180
So how do we do that.

64
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,990
It's fairly easy in swift.

65
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:22,260
Right.

66
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:31,610
You can just say right My name is something else like James for example and this should change my name

67
00:04:31,950 --> 00:04:33,830
but we cannot do that.

68
00:04:33,830 --> 00:04:41,220
As you can see it says that self is immutable and we get this problem but we work with struct so remember

69
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:50,490
instructs we have the possibility of to immutability even we had to use some mutating functions in order

70
00:04:50,490 --> 00:04:58,090
to meet sates our way bills in side of these functions when we deal with structure before.

71
00:04:58,350 --> 00:05:06,550
And in this case we have to change this variable right because Mary's side of this button and we cannot

72
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:11,910
have some constant variables every time and we have to change the variable.

73
00:05:11,910 --> 00:05:13,960
At some point in our app.

74
00:05:14,230 --> 00:05:23,200
So if you add state in front of your rainbow and of course you have to add s that as well then this

75
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:24,540
will be okay.

76
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:28,970
And this at State signed text is appropriate to wrapper.

77
00:05:29,160 --> 00:05:31,600
Then you add this at State.

78
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:36,920
It means that you get to change the variable and also then you change the variable.

79
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:44,680
It will re render the whole view so that you can actually see the change inside of your preview or inside

80
00:05:44,680 --> 00:05:46,420
of your app as well.

81
00:05:46,420 --> 00:05:52,210
For example let me run this and hit my button and as you can see now it saves James.

82
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:59,180
So whenever you make some variable at State variable it means that then you change it.

83
00:05:59,320 --> 00:06:03,160
The view will get re rendered and we will see the change.

84
00:06:03,220 --> 00:06:05,580
Now it works.

85
00:06:05,590 --> 00:06:09,310
So do we have more like states.

86
00:06:09,310 --> 00:06:09,570
Yep.

87
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,500
We have some more property wrappers as well.

88
00:06:13,510 --> 00:06:19,060
So let me show you some tutorial on the map.

89
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:24,210
I have seen this block and I liked it so I'm going to share this link with you.

90
00:06:24,250 --> 00:06:27,440
So let me just go over here and find it.

91
00:06:27,430 --> 00:06:30,250
Yep this is the one so I don't know these guys.

92
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:37,170
So apparently he's called midgets but I believe he actually read.

93
00:06:37,210 --> 00:06:43,660
He has actually written down the appropriate to represent a good structure and you cannot even find

94
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,890
that tutorial you cannot even find his explanations in the Apple Developer rep site right now.

95
00:06:50,890 --> 00:06:59,080
So I have read this appropriate trappers and I believe they are actually very well written.

96
00:06:59,740 --> 00:07:05,620
As you can see there are a lot of property wrappers and you're going to see the most common ones in

97
00:07:05,620 --> 00:07:12,510
this section and unfortunately we won't have time to see everything related to swift UI.

98
00:07:12,510 --> 00:07:16,040
That's a subject for a whole another course.

99
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:20,470
And in fact we have another course on Swift UI with code SaaS.

100
00:07:20,470 --> 00:07:28,300
You can check this up if you want but again if you're capable of understanding everything about swift

101
00:07:28,660 --> 00:07:35,420
if you're very good at Swift and U.S. development you can always go to developer dot apple dot com and

102
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,310
read the documentation and try to figure out on your own as well.

103
00:07:39,430 --> 00:07:46,330
Because when you complete this course you will be more than comfortable to work with U.S. development

104
00:07:46,330 --> 00:07:50,090
work with swift and create whatever project that you want.

105
00:07:50,320 --> 00:07:57,370
But keep in mind that we're going to learn the basics the introduction part of the Swift UI and there

106
00:07:57,370 --> 00:08:04,280
is much more things that you have to learn in order to master the swift UI as well.

107
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:10,960
So let's stop here and see one of the most important concepts called binding in the next lecture.
