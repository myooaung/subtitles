00:00:00,850 --> 00:00:01,480
Hi.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:09,090
We didn't this lecture we're going to see how we can get free and great images to use it on our own

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:10,610
games.

4
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:14,520
So this is one of the most important aspects of the game right.

5
00:00:14,520 --> 00:00:23,370
Because if the visuals if the images are not good then people won't use our game even if we do it in

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:25,900
a very well structure.

7
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,050
So let me open a Web site called open game art dot org.

8
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,250
So this is open game art.

9
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:43,620
And in here you will see a lot of images and lot of visuals to use it in your games.

10
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:50,940
In fact you can use most of the images here for free in your apps and month for just testing purposes

11
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:56,880
are not just for educational purposes but you can actually put them on the App Store as well.

12
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:05,460
So come over here to choose one of them or you can come over here to browse for to the arts for example

13
00:01:05,730 --> 00:01:15,420
or 3D arts or any other things like textures music you can just click one of the items over here to

14
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:23,700
see the license and copyright attribution notice as well as you can see this is public so you can just

15
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,400
come over here and use it on your own.

16
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:27,670
Yay.

17
00:01:28,050 --> 00:01:34,890
And since we're building an Angry Birds clone what we need is actually a bird right.

18
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:36,880
Which seems to be angry.

19
00:01:37,050 --> 00:01:45,000
So I'm going to come over here to search bar search for bird as you can see we have a lot of birds catches

20
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,300
over here.

21
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:51,210
So I like is the blue one down below.

22
00:01:51,210 --> 00:01:56,250
But you can go for other ones as well as you can see it says that free game sets.

23
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,350
So it's completely free I believe.

24
00:01:58,500 --> 00:01:59,840
I'm going to go with this.

25
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:05,420
So this is a flying bird and it looks like it's kind of an Angry Bird.

26
00:02:05,430 --> 00:02:08,550
So I'm going to use it anyway.

27
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:18,030
And if you want to have more than one image which is the case most of the time you you're more than

28
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:24,380
welcome to download this but also you're more than welcome to check the other assets of the same altar

29
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:25,240
as well.

30
00:02:25,350 --> 00:02:26,880
I'm going to show you how to do that.

31
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:35,270
So let me just create an Angry Bird image downloads folder so that I can stack my images or here.

32
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,980
So let me open this.

33
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:37,980
OK.

34
00:02:38,260 --> 00:02:46,260
Now let me delete this and let me go for PSG file over here and as you can see we have four versions

35
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:50,900
of this bird so that we can use it on our game.

36
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:59,140
I'm going to use only one of these images but it's nice to have far so that we can use whatever we want.

37
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:00,480
Right.

38
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:08,100
So how can you check the same out there for different kinds of images so that we will be consistent

39
00:03:08,370 --> 00:03:17,580
in our game using the same kind of image in here you will see the outer name like this is be ruling

40
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:23,830
dot com if you click on it you will see the other images from the same author.

41
00:03:23,900 --> 00:03:28,330
So as you can see same author has same kind of style.

42
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:36,800
So I can take any image from here that I want I can use it on my own game to be consistent with the

43
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:40,280
images to be consistent with the art.

44
00:03:40,430 --> 00:03:47,120
So let's search for other images like I want to have a tree I want to have a background I want to have

45
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:54,590
some bricks I will search for them inside of this all through of course if I cannot find I can go back

46
00:03:54,590 --> 00:04:01,670
and find something else anytime I want from some other alter as well but it's nice to have the same

47
00:04:01,670 --> 00:04:02,410
old.

48
00:04:02,570 --> 00:04:06,300
So when I like something I will open it in a new tab.

49
00:04:06,460 --> 00:04:07,040
OK.

50
00:04:07,220 --> 00:04:14,960
And then I will choose what to download later on and I believe this is much better than the previous

51
00:04:14,960 --> 00:04:21,560
three that we have found because it looks like some slingshot as well so that we can use it as a slingshot

52
00:04:22,220 --> 00:04:27,920
to throw our bird as you can see we have great images over here.

53
00:04:27,920 --> 00:04:32,830
For example I used this grumpy bee in one of my games before.

54
00:04:32,860 --> 00:04:39,080
So it's kind of neat to come over here to get free images and use it on your own game.

55
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:46,610
So this open game art that art is actually a very good Web site for developers who try to build their

56
00:04:46,700 --> 00:04:50,660
own game but don't know how to design new stuff.

57
00:04:50,660 --> 00:04:53,700
So here we have some wooden bricks.

58
00:04:53,690 --> 00:05:00,530
I'm going to open it as well because we will need some birth of wood and bricks as I said before and

59
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:02,220
I believe this looks good.

60
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:03,700
OK.

61
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:10,760
And we have some three and I believe I'm going to go for this one because this looks like a slingshot

62
00:05:10,790 --> 00:05:12,680
more than the other.

63
00:05:12,710 --> 00:05:20,180
So let me try to borrow some more because we need a background as well to use as a background in our

64
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:21,020
own game.

65
00:05:21,050 --> 00:05:29,270
And as you can see we have a pink birth here as well we can use some different kinds of birds if we

66
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:30,620
want to.

67
00:05:30,620 --> 00:05:32,810
So here we have a free background.

68
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:35,130
Yep that's what I was looking for.

69
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:43,000
So I'm going to open this one and I will continue to browse this to see if we get another think.

70
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:49,830
So here we have some cool characters cool monsters we have some other free background as well.

71
00:05:49,850 --> 00:05:51,590
Let me open this.

72
00:05:51,830 --> 00:05:55,010
And again we have some other free background as well.

73
00:05:55,190 --> 00:05:56,440
Let me open this.

74
00:05:57,320 --> 00:05:59,060
And here you go.

75
00:05:59,060 --> 00:06:02,670
We have other birds other monsters.

76
00:06:02,780 --> 00:06:10,670
I'm not going to use those in our game in order to not make things too complicated right now but I believe

77
00:06:10,670 --> 00:06:14,480
we are good to go with the backgrounds that we have found.

78
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:20,200
So let me try to see what what is the difference between these backgrounds that we have found.

79
00:06:20,570 --> 00:06:23,980
So far we have our chief we can just download this.

80
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:24,960
OK.

81
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:27,430
And we have our bricks.

82
00:06:27,530 --> 00:06:29,830
Well we can just download this as well.

83
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:33,750
But let's choose a background from here.

84
00:06:33,770 --> 00:06:41,510
So this is one background and this is some nicer background I believe this has some kind of pink mountains

85
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:46,460
and I believe this is the same thing as before.

86
00:06:46,460 --> 00:06:47,280
Right.

87
00:06:47,330 --> 00:06:50,420
So it looks like the same thing to me.

88
00:06:50,510 --> 00:06:53,740
So I'm going to go either this or that.

89
00:06:53,750 --> 00:06:56,060
So let me try to download this.

90
00:06:56,060 --> 00:06:59,900
So this is two hundred thirteen kilobytes.

91
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:02,830
And this has exactly the same size.

92
00:07:02,830 --> 00:07:05,220
So I believe they're are the same anyway.

93
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,080
So we're good to go with the first one.

94
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:14,330
If you don't want to spend time downloading all of this you can of course get it from my github page

95
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:15,660
as well.

96
00:07:15,740 --> 00:07:24,360
So let me go to Angry Birds and let me try to unzip all of these files.

97
00:07:24,410 --> 00:07:24,820
OK.

98
00:07:24,830 --> 00:07:33,140
So I'm going to use archival utility and let me double click on others as well so that we will check

99
00:07:33,170 --> 00:07:37,490
to see if we really get the images that we want.

100
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:44,500
So let me go over here to background and here you go I believe that's good.

101
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,990
We can use this as a background in our game.

102
00:07:47,030 --> 00:07:47,510
Right.

103
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,870
So let's close this down and let's go for this one.

104
00:07:53,870 --> 00:07:54,190
Yep.

105
00:07:54,200 --> 00:07:55,610
This is good as well.

106
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:59,030
Our old tree and in here we have a break.

107
00:07:59,030 --> 00:08:00,170
So this is one brick.

108
00:08:00,170 --> 00:08:03,260
This is two bricks and this is tree bricks.

109
00:08:03,320 --> 00:08:10,790
So I'm going to use one brick and we can copy and paste bricks in our game if we want to.

110
00:08:10,790 --> 00:08:19,290
So let's bring all of these images into our assets folder so let me open my game and go to assets and

111
00:08:19,290 --> 00:08:22,310
let's open our downloads folder as well.

112
00:08:22,380 --> 00:08:26,840
We have to rename them because we going to use the name anyway.

113
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,170
So I'm going to call this Burt.

114
00:08:29,550 --> 00:08:31,870
I'm going to bring this in.

115
00:08:31,910 --> 00:08:32,580
OK.

116
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:35,190
Let's go for the background.

117
00:08:35,220 --> 00:08:41,680
I'm going to rename this as background and let's bring this in as well.

118
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:43,760
Come over here two three.

119
00:08:43,770 --> 00:08:45,810
I'm going to name this tree.

120
00:08:45,870 --> 00:08:50,040
Let's bring this in one more time.

121
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:53,820
And for the last one we're going to use this brick.

122
00:08:53,820 --> 00:08:56,830
OK so I'm going to name this brick.

123
00:08:57,240 --> 00:08:58,910
And here you go.

124
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:05,790
Now we have what we need in terms of images in terms of textures so textures is a neat term that we

125
00:09:05,790 --> 00:09:08,280
are going to be using in this section.

126
00:09:08,280 --> 00:09:10,560
Don't worry we're going to see whether this.

127
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:17,830
Now you're ready to test our images we're ready to go into the game scene that SDK.

128
00:09:18,150 --> 00:09:20,520
We're going to do that in the next lecture.
