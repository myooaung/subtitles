00:00:00,960 --> 00:00:08,770
Hi within this lecture we going to finalize our app with adding some scoring functionality.

2
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:16,110
So far we can detect this collision and when this happens I want to increase my score by 1 but I don't

3
00:00:16,170 --> 00:00:21,100
even have a score variable and I don't even have a score labeled right now.

4
00:00:21,210 --> 00:00:24,020
So let's go over here and create them.

5
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:29,730
I'm going to create a simple variable called score and this will be initially zero.

6
00:00:29,780 --> 00:00:35,250
I'm going to create a score labeled and this will be an S.K. label note.

7
00:00:35,250 --> 00:00:42,150
So rather than having a sprite note we are having a label node over here so this is spatially designed

8
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:46,460
for bringing in labels for our games.

9
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:54,610
So let's go back to our did move to function and we're going to create our label.

10
00:00:54,900 --> 00:01:03,630
So we have actually created our variable but we're going to give it some properties over here and I'm

11
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:10,250
going to say something like that font name and let's how Helvetica for font name.

12
00:01:10,600 --> 00:01:11,360
OK.

13
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:15,240
Later on we're going to have a font size as well.

14
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:19,420
So let's try something like 60.

15
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:26,820
And if it's if it's is too big we can change it later on and let's go for our score labeled text.

16
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,980
It will be initially zero.

17
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:30,490
OK.

18
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:38,430
And then we can try to specify the position of this core label with a C.G. point.

19
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,920
So this will ask me for an X and Y.

20
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:50,400
I'm going to say 0 4 x because I want it to be in the middle of the screen but for y I'm going to say

21
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,320
something like soft dot frame that's height divided by four.

22
00:01:56,790 --> 00:02:04,070
And I believe we have to say score labeled dot position.

23
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:13,410
Again not position z position again and make it two so that it will be in the front of everything every

24
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:14,350
time.

25
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:21,240
And later on I can just say s dog Ed Child score label like we did before.

26
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:23,120
So let's try this.

27
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:27,180
So if it's too high or too low we can change this Y.

28
00:02:27,210 --> 00:02:29,490
But I believe that's perfect.

29
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:31,140
That's what I want.

30
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:33,880
So let me try to change this.

31
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:38,660
Let me try to increase the score by push the bird.

32
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:45,780
And when I hit one of the boxes so let me run this and you will see something strange maybe.

33
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:50,280
So let me try to just push this.

34
00:02:50,300 --> 00:02:56,920
And it is you can see when I hit one of these screen edges the contact gets cold.

35
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:07,350
So it will add my score to one when I hit something other than boxes as though it's because of our collision

36
00:03:07,350 --> 00:03:11,690
bit mask type of Bert and we're going to take care of that.

37
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:17,850
But I just want to show you that it really doesn't work in a way that we want.

38
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:25,720
So I'm going to come over here and rather than printing this contact I'm going to add one to our score.

39
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:32,660
I'm going to make my score labeled not text to be string of score right.

40
00:03:32,670 --> 00:03:35,260
So that you can see for yourselves.

41
00:03:35,390 --> 00:03:44,250
Now when I just push my bird and then it just hits one of the edges it will add one to my score like

42
00:03:44,250 --> 00:03:44,860
here.

43
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,400
So I just make my bird hit the edge like this.

44
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,060
It will add score and that's not what I want.

45
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:58,210
I just want to add my score when I hit the boxes.

46
00:03:58,700 --> 00:04:02,030
OK so that's what I want to change.

47
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:10,710
So come over here to collegian bit mask rather than saying bird over here to call either type I want

48
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:17,520
to make sure that this is bucks and this is bird over here and it's correct but I just want to detect

49
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:20,450
the collisions between boxes and birds.

50
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:27,440
So you have to go like this in the box you set it to Bert and in the bird you set it to bucks.

51
00:04:27,450 --> 00:04:33,600
So when I do that right now it doesn't increase my score because it doesn't detect the collision at

52
00:04:33,690 --> 00:04:34,350
all.

53
00:04:34,350 --> 00:04:39,630
But when I hit one of the boxes it increases my score.

54
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,150
So that's good.

55
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,930
That's what I wanted.

56
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,640
OK.

57
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:48,710
And off to you reset the position of the bird.

58
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,120
You may want to reset the number as value you may want to reset the score as well.

59
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:03,280
So if you want to do that you can just come over here to update function and just change discard variable

60
00:05:03,740 --> 00:05:05,020
if you don't want to do that.

61
00:05:05,020 --> 00:05:11,500
It's okay as well but if you want to do that you can just come over here as a zero as car labeled that

62
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:19,990
text is string score so that it will reset the position and it will do reset the score and then you

63
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,730
can set the game started to the false.

64
00:05:23,800 --> 00:05:25,240
So let's try that.

65
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:30,130
Let's push our bird it hits and it resets.

66
00:05:30,490 --> 00:05:32,050
So that's good.

67
00:05:32,050 --> 00:05:34,110
That's what we wanted to create.

68
00:05:34,150 --> 00:05:41,050
Of course using this Sprite kid techniques using this physical work that we're provided by the sprite

69
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:48,430
kid you can create whatever you want after you complete the course after you're certain that you're

70
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:52,250
capable or you're comfortable working with Swift.

71
00:05:52,480 --> 00:06:00,280
You can just try to enhance your sprite kid's skills a little bit and you can create much better games

72
00:06:00,580 --> 00:06:02,560
using the same techniques.

73
00:06:03,070 --> 00:06:09,400
I hope you enjoyed this section were you going to snap here and continue within the next section.
