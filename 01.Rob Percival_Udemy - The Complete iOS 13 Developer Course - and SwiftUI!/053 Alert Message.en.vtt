00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:01.300
Hi.

2
00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:06.210
We didn't this lecture you going to see how to create Ellard messages.

3
00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:10.000
So these messages are just small pop up messages.

4
00:00:10.140 --> 00:00:16.890
When we try to give some Ellard or some message to the user so they can see what's going on and they

5
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:21.240
can take some actions regarding to those messages.

6
00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:28.850
So in order to do that I'm going to create a single view app and I'm going to call this project Elliot's

7
00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:37.830
project or something because we're going to create a registration form in here in which we will have

8
00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:42.300
the user name and password and password to.

9
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:47.370
So if any of this information is given incorrectly.

10
00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:54.690
For example if user leaves the user name blank we will display an alert message saying that you have

11
00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:58.100
to go to and user name.

12
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:07.890
So this is a real functionality that we will be using during we make real apps in the upcoming lectures

13
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:09.120
upcoming sections.

14
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:10.080
Okay.

15
00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:18.170
So you have to learn how to create these alert messages in all of the apps you will need.

16
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:22.280
So let me create this design first.

17
00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:31.280
I'm going to start with text field came in which I will get the user name password and password to.

18
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.540
So first let me get the user name.

19
00:01:34.770 --> 00:01:37.160
So let me make this central.

20
00:01:37.170 --> 00:01:39.000
Let me go to attribute Spain.

21
00:01:39.050 --> 00:01:47.580
And we have to go to a place holder and say user name so user will know they will give user name in

22
00:01:47.580 --> 00:01:48.310
here.

23
00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:55.300
Right after that I'm just going to copy and paste is with control comments see and comment V.

24
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.060
This will be our password taxed.

25
00:01:58.230 --> 00:02:04.840
So I'm going to say password and then we're going to copy and paste this one more time.

26
00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.800
So this will be password again.

27
00:02:07.860 --> 00:02:12.800
So we are going to check if the first password matches the second password.

28
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:13.740
Okay.

29
00:02:13.830 --> 00:02:20.730
So this is a classical registration form you see in this kind of apps.

30
00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:26.580
So if these do not match then we will display an alert message as well.

31
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.470
So later on I'm going to go for button.

32
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:30.890
OK.

33
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.980
So this will be over register or sign up or save button.

34
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:43.620
So let me make this a little bit bigger and I'm going to call the sign up so user will sign up using

35
00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:46.470
this button and that's it.

36
00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.450
OK.

37
00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.470
So maybe we can make this a little bit Central.

38
00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:52.300
OK.

39
00:02:52.500 --> 00:03:00.540
And even we can just drag a label in order to have a title in our app so we can call this the registration

40
00:03:00.540 --> 00:03:02.940
app or alert message app.

41
00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.910
Okay so that's our app will look a little bit better.

42
00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.180
So let's say the users sign up.

43
00:03:12.180 --> 00:03:15.300
So this is a basic user sign up.

44
00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:19.490
We have controller that you can use in your own projects.

45
00:03:19.500 --> 00:03:26.280
So let me reset to suggest constraints and then we're going to open our weave controller.

46
00:03:26.290 --> 00:03:29.960
That's in and another assistant editor.

47
00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:37.190
And we're going to control drag and drop and just define those text fields.

48
00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:38.820
We don't need this label right.

49
00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:45.750
We we can just go for this text field so for text field I'm going to go for the user name text.

50
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:46.610
OK.

51
00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:49.010
So let me get the second one.

52
00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:52.320
We will call this password tax password.

53
00:03:52.380 --> 00:04:01.940
Text and then we can go forward turned one which is password to text or password again text.

54
00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:05.050
So I'm going to call this password to text.

55
00:04:05.100 --> 00:04:13.200
So for the last one I'm going to control drag and drop this button as an action and I will call the

56
00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:15.190
sign up clicked.

57
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.040
OK here we go.

58
00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:24.990
Now we can close this down and we can actually go and head back to our real controller dot swift because

59
00:04:24.990 --> 00:04:28.500
we're going to create our first alert message.

60
00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.400
So let's do that in sign up clicked function.

61
00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:38.820
OK so first of all I'm just going to show you how to create this Alex box when you click on those it

62
00:04:38.820 --> 00:04:47.160
will just display it later on we are going to do our if controls or if statements and in order to create

63
00:04:47.250 --> 00:04:51.720
Ellard message we're going to create a variable called Elliott.

64
00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:55.660
And of course we agreed to use a class for that.

65
00:04:55.680 --> 00:04:58.270
It's already built in the Swift.

66
00:04:58.290 --> 00:05:03.010
So we can just get that and I use that in our project.

67
00:05:03.020 --> 00:05:05.550
So it's called UI alert controller.

68
00:05:05.610 --> 00:05:06.370
Okay.

69
00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:11.310
Not UI alerts action but you are alert controller.

70
00:05:11.410 --> 00:05:15.280
So we're going to see what a UI alert action is later on.

71
00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:18.860
Right now we have to create this alert controller.

72
00:05:18.970 --> 00:05:23.200
As you can see this is an object that displays an alert message.

73
00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:28.580
If you open parentheses you will see the required parameters like this.

74
00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:35.230
So we're going to go for just turned one the parameters of title message and preferred style.

75
00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:39.970
So title is actually the title what will be the title of our message.

76
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:42.370
Something like air will do the job.

77
00:05:42.910 --> 00:05:44.760
Now we can go to message.

78
00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:48.130
This will really display a message you know alert bugs.

79
00:05:48.190 --> 00:05:51.640
So I'm going to go for user name not found for example.

80
00:05:51.670 --> 00:05:57.430
OK so user will see this messaging and other alert message box.

81
00:05:57.430 --> 00:06:04.050
So first style if you click enter over here you can choose four different styles.

82
00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:12.490
So if you click enter and hit dot you will see that it's going to be either an action sheet or an alert

83
00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:13.990
every want to alert.

84
00:06:13.990 --> 00:06:18.010
In this case so actually sheet is kind of a menu.

85
00:06:18.430 --> 00:06:20.830
But we want alert.

86
00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:29.580
So again we have created this UI Elliott controller now we can present this to users by saying self

87
00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:36.670
we have controller so self refers to we have controller remember self that presents.

88
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:41.380
So if you say present it will ask you what to present.

89
00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:45.150
So we want to present this alert that we have created.

90
00:06:45.970 --> 00:06:48.680
So you can just say alerts here.

91
00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:49.540
OK.

92
00:06:49.570 --> 00:06:55.990
And if you create some other views later on you can present it using same technique.

93
00:06:56.590 --> 00:07:01.420
So I'm going to go for alerts and it's going to be animated.

94
00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:09.610
Why not just say through and completion it asks for if I'm going to do anything when this operation

95
00:07:09.610 --> 00:07:18.010
completes I don't need that kind of thing right now so I'm going to say Neal and we will have some kind

96
00:07:18.010 --> 00:07:20.290
of completion later on in this lecture.

97
00:07:20.290 --> 00:07:21.530
Don't worry about it.

98
00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:31.180
So let's build this and see if we can get this as an alert message and let's test if this will do the

99
00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:35.140
job or if we will make another adjustments over here.

100
00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.860
So if I click on sign up as you can see I get the message.

101
00:07:38.890 --> 00:07:39.300
OK.

102
00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:42.700
So this is working but I cannot get out of it.

103
00:07:42.700 --> 00:07:46.020
So wherever I click it doesn't these appear.

104
00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:54.160
So I don't have anybody right now saying okay or cancel or go back I don't have that kind of thing so

105
00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:58.840
I cannot go back right now and this is not what I want.

106
00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.980
So this is displaying so it's OK.

107
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:07.900
But we add we have to add some new things to it like we have to add a button.

108
00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:08.530
Right.

109
00:08:09.190 --> 00:08:16.840
So in order to create this button before we present this alert message we have to add an action to our

110
00:08:16.930 --> 00:08:17.560
alerts.

111
00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:24.330
So we are going to say this is going to be okay by them for example and for you.

112
00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:24.770
OK.

113
00:08:24.790 --> 00:08:33.760
But I'm going to use UI alert action and this UI alert action again will ask me for a title and a style

114
00:08:33.760 --> 00:08:34.700
and a handler.

115
00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:37.730
Where are you going to see what a handler is.

116
00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:43.240
So title is going to be the text that we will display in the bottom.

117
00:08:43.810 --> 00:08:48.790
So this is going to be something like Okay or cancel.

118
00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:49.870
Go back.

119
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:51.040
I understand.

120
00:08:51.210 --> 00:08:51.570
Okay.

121
00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:52.690
So I'm going to go for.

122
00:08:52.690 --> 00:08:53.610
OK.

123
00:08:53.890 --> 00:08:57.980
So sale we have different kinds of styles here.

124
00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:04.410
If you hit enter and hit that you can see those styles like we how Council's style.

125
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.850
We have default destructive.

126
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.480
You can't try these cycles.

127
00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.060
It shows the button in a different way.

128
00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:18.370
If you use those for example if you're going to destruct or if you're going to delete something you

129
00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:20.080
can go for destructive.

130
00:09:20.290 --> 00:09:24.100
If you're going to cancel the operation you can go for cancel.

131
00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:28.170
This only changes the display of the button as I said.

132
00:09:28.240 --> 00:09:28.800
So it did.

133
00:09:28.930 --> 00:09:33.100
It doesn't affect the code or it doesn't affect the action itself.

134
00:09:33.580 --> 00:09:42.070
So I'm going to go for default but later on you can try to go with cancel and distractive to see how

135
00:09:42.070 --> 00:09:43.840
does that look like.

136
00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.240
So in the handler.

137
00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:51.130
So what do you want to happen if someone clicks on this button.

138
00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:56.830
So this is very you write your code in order to do that you have to hit enter.

139
00:09:56.830 --> 00:10:02.770
And if you don't want something to happen if you just want to dismiss this button you can't say Neil

140
00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:04.060
here as well.

141
00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.150
But I'm gonna go for that and hit enter.

142
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:10.600
It will create a UI Elliott action in here.

143
00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:16.510
So this is a variable if you want to interact with the UI Elliott action itself.

144
00:10:16.510 --> 00:10:25.690
So I'm just going to go and hit enter and the part that we're interested in is the coding part itself.

145
00:10:25.690 --> 00:10:28.470
So as you can see chose us with code.

146
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:36.820
So whenever someone clicks on these you you okay button if I want something to happen I will write insight

147
00:10:36.910 --> 00:10:40.150
of these codes and this will be called.

148
00:10:40.270 --> 00:10:41.890
Okay using this variable.

149
00:10:43.090 --> 00:10:45.820
So this generates its for itself.

150
00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:51.920
All you have to do is just hit enter on you when you see the handler itself.

151
00:10:51.970 --> 00:10:58.810
So I'm just gonna say button clicked and let me just do a print statement here button clicked so we

152
00:10:58.810 --> 00:11:02.450
can actually see it in the logs.

153
00:11:02.770 --> 00:11:05.770
And later on since I created this.

154
00:11:05.830 --> 00:11:13.890
Okay by then since I created the UI Elliott action I have to connect this to my alert itself.

155
00:11:14.020 --> 00:11:17.740
And in order to do that I will say Elliott dot ad action.

156
00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:18.640
Okay.

157
00:11:18.670 --> 00:11:21.300
It will ask me for a UI to action.

158
00:11:21.440 --> 00:11:23.010
I'm going to say OK.

159
00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:23.690
Button.

160
00:11:24.250 --> 00:11:26.090
So that's good.

161
00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:32.920
I believe now we are ready to test is actually so let's run this into simulator and let's see how it

162
00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:33.680
looks like.

163
00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:36.700
So you're going to see the same thing again.

164
00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:43.070
We're just going to go and sign up and as you can see now we houses the okay button over here.

165
00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:48.970
If I click okay it will dismiss the message and you will see but then clicked.

166
00:11:48.970 --> 00:11:56.320
So whenever you create an okay but only if you use an handler in the handler you can write whatever

167
00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.370
you want it to happen after these messages dismissed.

168
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:10.050
So by then clicked works and that's all for right now we have seen how to create an alert message.

169
00:12:10.060 --> 00:12:12.430
Now it's a little bit challenge for you.

170
00:12:12.430 --> 00:12:20.560
I'm gonna suggest you posed the reader here and you try to come up with an algorithm that says user

171
00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:21.620
name not found.

172
00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:29.590
If user name text is blank and if if it's okay it's going to check for the password text and if password

173
00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:35.950
is missing it will say password missing and then later on it will check to see if password text on password

174
00:12:35.950 --> 00:12:41.310
to text do not match and it will give a related error message.

175
00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:49.330
So you're going to have to create a sign up registration form with Elliott messages that just controls

176
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:53.350
if user name text is given if password text is given.

177
00:12:53.350 --> 00:12:59.610
If passwords actually match so posed the video tried to do it on your own.

178
00:12:59.980 --> 00:13:02.260
And if you can do it that's great.

179
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:03.040
If you cannot.

180
00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:07.780
Don't worry we will do that together in the next lecture.
