Hi.

2
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:07,350
We didn't the section we were going to write our first game so I'm going to show you how our game looks

3
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:12,780
like and I'm going to ask you to think about how you can write it on your own.

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,830
Because 95 percent of this code will be the code that you have already learned about.

5
00:00:19,860 --> 00:00:24,620
So of course you're going to have to do some little bit of googling as well.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:29,570
But I believe you can come up with a good idea to create this game.

7
00:00:29,970 --> 00:00:36,090
And of course after that I'm going to show my way of doing it and we're going to code alone together

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,530
to create this game.

9
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:39,290
So this is exciting.

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:40,710
Our first game.

11
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:43,310
Now if you're ready let's get started.
