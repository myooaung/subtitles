00:00:00.730 --> 00:00:01.370
Hi.

2
00:00:01.480 --> 00:00:08.180
We didn't this lecture we are going to continue our upload process by taking care of the problems.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:17.910
So far we haven't experienced any problem yet but as we're naming every image as an image that J pack

4
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:26.310
it will create a problem for us because this actually saves everything in this surge as image that J

5
00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:32.110
PAC and if we had a previous image that J PAC it will get replaced.

6
00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.680
So let me test this.

7
00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:43.110
So let me upload another picture to a we're so rich and we got the your URL back and it's working actually.

8
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:47.750
But let me go back to my storage and let me refresh this.

9
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:52.920
OK so that we can see the new details in here.

10
00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:01.860
And if if it's working row of curves we expect to see two images inside of our storage folder inside

11
00:01:01.860 --> 00:01:03.120
of our media folder.

12
00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:03.620
Right.

13
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.840
Because we uploaded two images so far but as you can see we only see one.

14
00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:17.280
So if I click on those it will download the image and this is the last image that I have uploaded.

15
00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:25.470
It's kind of a problem for me because if I do it this way there will be only one post in my whole Instagram

16
00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:34.890
app and I don't want this to happen so I have to come up with a way to rename all the images in a different

17
00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:35.220
way.

18
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.430
So they will have to have their own unique names.

19
00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:43.470
So maybe it's sparked something in your head.

20
00:01:43.470 --> 00:01:43.770
Right.

21
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:45.540
Because we did it before.

22
00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:54.450
We have used universally unique ideas to give unique ideas in our art book section maybe you remember.

23
00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:54.840
Right.

24
00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:58.680
So we're going to do the same thing in here as well.

25
00:01:58.710 --> 00:02:04.920
We're going to use you you I.D. this time not for giving I.D. but giving names.

26
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:12.270
So we're going to convert you you I.D. two strings and we're going to rename our images with you you

27
00:02:12.270 --> 00:02:12.950
I.D..

28
00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:18.270
So every time we do this operation they will get different names.

29
00:02:18.390 --> 00:02:19.770
So how do we do that.

30
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:20.880
Maybe you remember.

31
00:02:21.420 --> 00:02:23.480
So you can try to do it on your own.

32
00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:27.450
But let me show you because it's only one line actually.

33
00:02:27.450 --> 00:02:35.770
You see you you I.D. dot you you I.D. with parentheses actually and Dot you have to say you you I.D.

34
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:40.840
drink because this has its own object you you I.D. type.

35
00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.600
We have to convert this to a string by saying you you I.D. drink.

36
00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:45.870
OK.

37
00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:55.650
And this will create a unique I.D. for us a unique given the random text for us every time we do that.

38
00:02:55.650 --> 00:03:02.900
So rather than saying image that J PAC I'm gonna go ahead and say you you I.D. in here so that every

39
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:10.320
time I upload something it will have a different kind different kind of name actually not different

40
00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.690
kinds.

41
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:19.920
So let me run this from the beginning and let me just test as if we can actually upload two images to

42
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:20.970
the server.

43
00:03:20.970 --> 00:03:24.260
So let me upload one here like Mona Lisa.

44
00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:32.010
So let me upload this once I see the euro all in here I can go back and upload another one.

45
00:03:32.030 --> 00:03:32.980
OK.

46
00:03:33.120 --> 00:03:35.640
So we can do this here as well.

47
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:42.130
Let me go for this one and it it got uploaded as well I believe.

48
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:42.840
Yes.

49
00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:44.940
Let's go back to our media folder.

50
00:03:44.940 --> 00:03:49.500
Let's open the files or folders from here.

51
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:56.250
If we go in side of our media we have to see three images right now.

52
00:03:56.250 --> 00:03:58.220
Two of them from the session.

53
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:00.460
And one of them from the last one.

54
00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.080
Here you go we have the need to 1.

55
00:04:03.090 --> 00:04:12.540
So if I click on this it will download this and it downloaded it but it came up as a different file

56
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:14.650
like a DMV file.

57
00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.560
The M.S. files are.

58
00:04:16.810 --> 00:04:21.130
And the reason for that is we didn't specify any extension.

59
00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:29.800
Once we uploaded this remember we just actually uploaded this VW UI this string name.

60
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.530
But in here we have used dot J pack before.

61
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:38.580
So we have to make sure we give extensions then we upload this.

62
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:46.230
So let me go back here and rather than saying you you I.D. we can just add you you I.D. that J pack

63
00:04:46.430 --> 00:04:53.430
in order to do that of course I'm going to wrap this with parentheses and put some reverse slash here

64
00:04:53.430 --> 00:04:54.930
like we did before.

65
00:04:54.930 --> 00:05:00.940
So remember this provides us opportunity to use variables inside of strings.

66
00:05:01.230 --> 00:05:02.330
And here you go.

67
00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:09.980
Now we will add j peg at the end of this u u I.D. so that we can actually save all of this information

68
00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:12.370
with a J Pag exception.

69
00:05:12.680 --> 00:05:17.010
So let's test this in our simulator lets go to upload.

70
00:05:17.030 --> 00:05:21.500
Let's go to let's go and select one more.

71
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:22.500
OK.

72
00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:27.710
We're uploading the Mona Lisa and then one more time.

73
00:05:27.770 --> 00:05:32.690
Let's go to scream or Yep scream will do.

74
00:05:32.750 --> 00:05:34.510
So let's go to upload.

75
00:05:34.550 --> 00:05:35.770
And here we go.

76
00:05:35.780 --> 00:05:39.140
Now let's go back to our storage file.

77
00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.920
Let's refresh this and let's go into the media.

78
00:05:43.610 --> 00:05:51.600
And here we go now we have these two files with you you I.D. names but this time with a J Pag extension.

79
00:05:51.620 --> 00:05:53.490
So we're good to go here.

80
00:05:53.510 --> 00:06:03.710
We we are now completed these upload process so we are good to go with downloading and uploading everything

81
00:06:03.980 --> 00:06:06.500
as we want.

82
00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:12.650
So now let me close this down because I think we're pretty certain this is working.

83
00:06:12.740 --> 00:06:14.020
OK.

84
00:06:14.060 --> 00:06:16.980
And let's go back to our code.

85
00:06:17.060 --> 00:06:24.200
Let me delete all of this actually so that I don't have a lot of images in my downloads folder.

86
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:29.540
So let me close this down and let's go back to our X code.

87
00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:34.960
So the thing is in this area of course we can display an alert message.

88
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:35.900
OK.

89
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:43.700
And in order to do that I'm going to create a function for that I'm going to code is make Eliot and

90
00:06:43.910 --> 00:06:51.780
of course I'm going to start by saying let Elliot is going to be an UI alert controller.

91
00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:52.820
OK.

92
00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.120
And this is not autocomplete Inc.

93
00:06:55.130 --> 00:06:59.810
I believe it's going to come back soon once it recovers.

94
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:02.370
And of course this is not let.

95
00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:07.040
It has to be func OK I'm creating get functioning here.

96
00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:14.440
And if I open parentheses yep this time in total complete so for a title I'm going to go for error.

97
00:07:14.540 --> 00:07:22.450
And of course we can get that title inputs and their message inputs in order to use this more than one

98
00:07:22.450 --> 00:07:24.740
time as we usually do.

99
00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:25.700
OK.

100
00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:33.590
So in the title I'm going to say a title input OK in the message I'm going to go for message input and

101
00:07:33.590 --> 00:07:39.720
preferred style is going to be Elliot and then we have to add a new button to here.

102
00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:44.870
OK button OK I'm going to say this is going to be a UI error to action.

103
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:52.420
And for the title of this button I'm going to go for OK sale will be cancel or default doesn't matter.

104
00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:57.540
I don't need any handler and I'm going to say alert up add action.

105
00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:57.970
OK.

106
00:07:57.980 --> 00:07:58.960
Button.

107
00:07:58.970 --> 00:08:06.720
And finally we can present this words of curse animation we love animations and completion nil.

108
00:08:07.130 --> 00:08:13.970
So rather than displaying this print I'm going to come over here and say Make Elliot M for a title.

109
00:08:13.970 --> 00:08:21.230
I'm going to say error an error message will come from this error that localized description and it

110
00:08:21.230 --> 00:08:26.380
will show the error message of this fire base.

111
00:08:26.390 --> 00:08:34.010
So if we can provide a default value for nil or for empty locations that would be great.

112
00:08:34.460 --> 00:08:40.000
And it asks us to add stuff and it makes sense because we are in a closure.

113
00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:42.440
So here we go.

114
00:08:42.650 --> 00:08:46.510
Now I believe we're done with this uploading process.

115
00:08:46.550 --> 00:08:56.150
So what we want is to get this image URL and we're getting this in here rather than printing this I

116
00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:59.010
want to add this to our database.

117
00:08:59.030 --> 00:09:05.790
So after this we're going to do our database actions inside of that closure.

118
00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:13.010
OK so that whenever a user comments writes that comment and hits the upload button I'm going to take

119
00:09:13.010 --> 00:09:20.420
the imager I'll take these comments take the user name and take the data from the system and upload

120
00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.610
them to my database.

121
00:09:22.610 --> 00:09:26.210
That's what we're going to work on in the next lecture.
