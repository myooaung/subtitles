00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,180
Hi.

2
00:00:01,350 --> 00:00:07,260
We within this lecture regrouping to create our project from here of course and we're going to create

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:10,020
our user interface.

4
00:00:10,020 --> 00:00:13,560
So let me go with single view app as usual.

5
00:00:13,560 --> 00:00:14,450
OK.

6
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,530
And let's uncheck this swift you I think and I'm going to call this currency converter.

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:22,560
OK.

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:24,300
So that's what you're going to do.

9
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:32,170
So let me hit on next and put my folder in my regular IRS complete folder.

10
00:00:32,190 --> 00:00:34,050
Ok.

11
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:38,520
And of course we're going to start with creating our user interface.

12
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:45,150
But before we do that we have to decide what Carolyn sees that we want to show to the user.

13
00:00:45,150 --> 00:00:47,090
We have to choose some currencies right.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:50,670
We cannot show one hundred and seventy of them.

15
00:00:50,670 --> 00:00:57,090
It will be a waste of time for us because we're just trying to build an exemplary app like we can just

16
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:04,440
show five or six currencies to the users so that we can on their sent have to work with API and Jason

17
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:05,610
us.

18
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:13,520
So let me go to main story Bert first and let me show you how this is going to work out.

19
00:01:13,560 --> 00:01:17,230
So in here we have all this data.

20
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,880
OK then we have to understand what we are getting in here so that we can actually decide what to show

21
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:25,980
what to display to the user.

22
00:01:25,980 --> 00:01:29,430
And I'm going to copy all of this data from here.

23
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,340
I'm going to displayed in a better way.

24
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:38,700
So if you go to Google and if you search for Jason beautify here like this.

25
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:39,730
OK.

26
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:43,950
And in fact you can just say J some beat file your own line.

27
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:45,200
OK.

28
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,110
This will give us a lot of options to be to FI Our Jason format.

29
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:55,490
So you can go for the first one or the second one.

30
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,840
I believe I have used this one before.

31
00:01:57,850 --> 00:02:00,980
So this is called B to fight that's OK.

32
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:10,380
You can paste this value in here you can copy this and you can just pacing here and you can just click

33
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,870
on this beautify button in order to be to fly this Jason format.

34
00:02:16,890 --> 00:02:22,710
So if you click on this as you can see now we have a very structured look.

35
00:02:22,710 --> 00:02:26,520
So this gives me all these information.

36
00:02:26,550 --> 00:02:26,900
OK.

37
00:02:26,930 --> 00:02:31,710
So this is how Jason format is supposed to be shown.

38
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:36,530
So let me see what we get in our data.

39
00:02:36,690 --> 00:02:41,330
So it gives me whether this is a success or not since we are getting the data.

40
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:43,770
As you can see success is true.

41
00:02:43,770 --> 00:02:49,180
So you can use this value in order to understand if you're getting the data or not.

42
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:56,430
Maybe if the success is false then you can just show some Alec message to the user saying that yes there

43
00:02:56,430 --> 00:02:57,660
was something wrong.

44
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:07,600
So in here we have the time stamp indicating where this is then this is actually requested and the base

45
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:19,140
currency is euro and the date is these six of the August in 2019 and in here we just seeing the relative

46
00:03:19,740 --> 00:03:24,780
value to these crises to the euro.

47
00:03:24,930 --> 00:03:33,430
For example if you come over here you will see the euro and it's 1 because euro over euro is one.

48
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,620
If you come down like a GBP.

49
00:03:36,630 --> 00:03:38,900
This is great Britain pounds.

50
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:44,780
As you can see one Euro Q equals two all ninety two pounds.

51
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:53,160
And then here we have the USD one euro equals to one point eleven and we have some Turkish lira like

52
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:57,060
one euro equals to six Turkish lira us.

53
00:03:57,140 --> 00:04:02,700
Are we going to choose some of this they tells you you're going to choose the currencies that we want

54
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,750
to work with every going to display them to the user.

55
00:04:06,930 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm going to only work with the right.

56
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,660
I'm going to only display the currencies to the user.

57
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:20,790
But maybe you may want to get the date you may want to get the other values and you show them to the

58
00:04:20,790 --> 00:04:29,010
user as well later on for right now you can just follow along with me and try to understand what's going

59
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:30,450
on in here.

60
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:31,270
OK.

61
00:04:31,620 --> 00:04:38,550
So I'm going to create a label over here I'm just going to Chrome called his currency converter so that

62
00:04:38,550 --> 00:04:41,250
we can have a title for our app.

63
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:41,640
OK.

64
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,990
This is going to be our title.

65
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:55,980
And let me make this a little bit bigger and put it over here and I'm going to bring in some more of

66
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:00,810
these labels because if you're going to be displaying all those values in the labels right.

67
00:05:00,920 --> 00:05:07,490
For example if we're going to display the value of the USD we're going to do that using a label.

68
00:05:07,490 --> 00:05:11,300
So we have to choose what we're going to display in here.

69
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:19,640
For example if we go back to our data we have this C.D. and it stands for Canadian dollars I believe.

70
00:05:19,670 --> 00:05:22,340
So anyway I'm going to use it.

71
00:05:23,150 --> 00:05:28,270
So let me just say S.A.T. and make this a little bigger.

72
00:05:28,270 --> 00:05:33,940
OK then you can just copy and paste this by comment see and comment V.

73
00:05:34,350 --> 00:05:41,990
OK and bring this here so that I can name this something else.

74
00:05:41,990 --> 00:05:42,560
Let me see.

75
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:42,900
Yep.

76
00:05:42,920 --> 00:05:44,120
This is Swiss franc.

77
00:05:44,120 --> 00:05:51,710
So C H F Ok I'm going to go for CHF and let me copy and paste.

78
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,040
One more time if I can do it.

79
00:05:55,100 --> 00:05:55,550
Yep.

80
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:59,280
Finally let me bring it over here.

81
00:05:59,420 --> 00:06:02,060
And this time let's go for GBP.

82
00:06:02,060 --> 00:06:04,960
So this is pounds sterling.

83
00:06:05,210 --> 00:06:06,650
So that's cool.

84
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:15,430
Let me copy and paste one more time and in here I'm going to choose JP Vi.

85
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,420
So this is Japanese yen.

86
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,890
Okay.

87
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:25,540
And of course we're going to have to go with the USD anyway because this is one of the most comments.

88
00:06:26,030 --> 00:06:30,290
And for final thing I'm going to go for Turkish lira.

89
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:35,060
So this is t r VI so that's good right.

90
00:06:35,060 --> 00:06:44,990
We're going to display the six yes six of these currencies to the user and I believe that's enough in

91
00:06:44,990 --> 00:06:51,330
order for us to understand what's going on in this app right.

92
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:58,730
Finally I'm going to bring in a button and this button will get me the rates does buy them will download

93
00:06:58,730 --> 00:07:00,880
me the data.

94
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:08,600
So of course we can do all of these things in under like we did load or another function as well as

95
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,120
I'm going to do this with the bottom.

96
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:11,830
OK.

97
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:15,740
So that we can just call this whenever we want.

98
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:20,230
And let me reset to suggest that constraints.

99
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:21,230
And here you go.

100
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:23,750
I believe we have our constraints now.

101
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,790
I can bring this bring those labels in.

102
00:07:27,790 --> 00:07:33,440
So let me open my assistant editor and let me start with S.A.T..

103
00:07:33,470 --> 00:07:40,130
So this is Canadian dollars and I'm going to control dragged that here and I'm going to call the S.A.T.

104
00:07:40,130 --> 00:07:40,790
label.

105
00:07:41,150 --> 00:07:41,670
OK.

106
00:07:41,970 --> 00:07:47,040
Let's next thing here is C H S label OK.

107
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,330
Does a Swiss franc.

108
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:54,520
So let me go over here and let's bring in the pound.

109
00:07:54,590 --> 00:07:56,320
So this is GBP label.

110
00:07:57,130 --> 00:07:57,550
Yep.

111
00:07:57,650 --> 00:08:05,060
This is Japanese yen so JPY label and the USD label.

112
00:08:05,060 --> 00:08:10,290
See why I have chosen six rather than 100 for example.

113
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:16,250
So it's going to take a little time so this is going to be t r y labels.

114
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:22,450
So that's good little thing to do is to bring in the bottom is an action.

115
00:08:22,460 --> 00:08:32,270
So let me tidy up here a little bit and the final thing is to drag and drop this button as an action

116
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,810
and I'm going to call does get rates clicked.

117
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:41,580
So here you go our user interface is actually ready.

118
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:48,500
So I believe we can stop here within the next lecture we're going to start writing our first codes in

119
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,960
order to create these requests.
