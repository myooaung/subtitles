Hi.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:07,410
We didn't this lecture re going to display those seem some models in our table view.

3
00:00:07,410 --> 00:00:12,360
In fact we're going to display only the name of those Simpson values right.

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:17,180
We're going to display the other features in the details view controller.

5
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:25,650
So let's come over here and rather than saying these dummy values were going to use the exact values.

6
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:32,910
So first of all we have this Homer array in here and I don't like that because we're going to need those

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:38,840
Homer array values so I'm going to create Homer array in here.

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:39,920
Right.

9
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,140
And the Homer A's not a good choice actually.

10
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:52,590
We can call the Simpsons array or you can just call this my Simpsons OK and open the parentheses and

11
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:53,800
does my Simpsons.

12
00:00:53,910 --> 00:01:01,580
We'll have Simpsons objects inside of disarray and we have to initialize this as an empty array.

13
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:02,060
OK.

14
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:07,440
So don't forget to just add some parentheses over here.

15
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:11,820
OK I'll put an open close parentheses and this will go away.

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:21,330
So rather than using commentary I'm going to punch my models a model objects inside of this array so

17
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:24,480
I can go over here as say my Simpsons.

18
00:01:24,510 --> 00:01:24,820
OK.

19
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:26,270
Let me delete this.

20
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,570
My Simpsons.

21
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,120
So what was it called My Simpsons dots at punt.

22
00:01:33,120 --> 00:01:40,490
And this is a Simpson area so it will ask me for a Simpson element and I'm going to add one by one.

23
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:46,590
So my Simpsons that the point Homer my Simpsons that's a pants March.

24
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:47,660
OK.

25
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:50,940
So let's do this step by step.

26
00:01:50,940 --> 00:01:55,930
Marge Bart and then let's go for Lisa.

27
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,790
And then lastly my Simpsons dog the pants Maggie.

28
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:04,950
So here we go we have our very right.

29
00:02:05,010 --> 00:02:09,240
And we can reach that array from anywhere in our class.

30
00:02:09,540 --> 00:02:17,550
So I can go to other functions right now and called is my Simpsons array without hesitating.

31
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:25,230
So rather than saying return 10 I can just go over say my Simpsons dot count.

32
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:26,420
Right.

33
00:02:26,460 --> 00:02:27,270
I can't.

34
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:28,970
I could I just said five.

35
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:33,720
But it doesn't make sense I can add some more values later on.

36
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:41,910
So I'm going to go over here and close the sushi down and say My Simpsons dots count.

37
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:44,180
So again this is OK.

38
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:45,890
Number of roses section.

39
00:02:45,960 --> 00:02:47,300
We got it right.

40
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:55,830
But right now we have to make sure that we display the name of the Simpsons E side of our table view

41
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:56,310
cell.

42
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,490
So I'm not going to say Homer Simpson here.

43
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:09,150
Rather I'm going to go over say my Simpsons and four in Dax remember we can just go for and say index

44
00:03:09,150 --> 00:03:14,730
path that's wrong because index path is given to us with the inside that function.

45
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:18,810
So you can just called and say index path that throw bus.

46
00:03:19,050 --> 00:03:25,060
But this won't do it because this will return us a simple some object.

47
00:03:25,140 --> 00:03:32,100
And I cannot show as Simpson object in my cell because I need a string in here.

48
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:33,010
Right.

49
00:03:33,030 --> 00:03:38,400
So rather than saying My Simpsons index path that row what we like say.

50
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:41,400
So this will give me as Simpson object.

51
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:41,730
Right.

52
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:48,030
So if I say Simpson object dot it will display the name to me.

53
00:03:48,570 --> 00:03:57,420
So I'm going to display the Simpsons names in my cell that tax labeled dot tax.

54
00:03:57,510 --> 00:04:03,460
So this is going to work right now because we're done with the setup.

55
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:10,230
So if you run this on your simulator you will see the names of the Simpson objects.

56
00:04:10,230 --> 00:04:18,540
Here we go we now see the Homer Simpson Marge Simpson Bart Lisa Maggie we have it all here.

57
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:26,940
So the next step will be to pass this information when we click one of these objects and display that's

58
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,240
related models or related objects values inside of our details.

59
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,020
We have controller we going to do that in the next lecture.
