00:00:00,810 --> 00:00:10,110
Hi within this lecture we going to see what a Jason is and how we can use this Jason in order to process

2
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:13,410
this data and show this to the user.

3
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:16,820
So let me go to Google and search for Jason.

4
00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:20,830
So as you can see it has its own Web site.

5
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:23,080
So this is Jason that's arc.

6
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:30,060
And this actually stands for JavaScript object notation.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:33,390
So this is kind of a way to display data.

8
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:33,870
OK.

9
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:35,400
This is a format.

10
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:39,250
This is standard format in order to display data.

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:48,420
So in order to have an object the notation standard and it kind of looks like this but we're going to

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:51,660
see the real Jason data in a minute.

13
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:55,050
So let me go down here.

14
00:00:55,170 --> 00:00:58,660
You will see a lot of programming languages.

15
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,900
So we don't use Jason only in Swifts only in IOW development.

16
00:01:03,900 --> 00:01:13,370
So as you can see a lot of programming languages have some libraries that converge with Jason format.

17
00:01:13,440 --> 00:01:21,690
So this is kind of a standard format centered Object Notation that we can use in a lot of programs in

18
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:28,770
a lot of software using in a lot of programming languages in lots of platforms as well so that we can

19
00:01:28,800 --> 00:01:30,380
easily use this easily.

20
00:01:30,380 --> 00:01:36,060
Corporate this to any data that we may want to display to the user.

21
00:01:36,810 --> 00:01:37,320
OK.

22
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:45,780
So I'm going to go back to my fixer that I owe and I'm going to show you how our data will look like

23
00:01:45,810 --> 00:01:47,400
in real example.

24
00:01:48,260 --> 00:01:50,490
And you have to sign up for it.

25
00:01:50,510 --> 00:01:57,780
So as you can see we have somebody over here saying that get free API key and after you sign up of course

26
00:01:57,780 --> 00:01:59,240
you can log in.

27
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:04,220
But right now I'm going to show you how to create an account.

28
00:02:04,230 --> 00:02:05,020
OK.

29
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,420
So when you click on here you have to choose free plan.

30
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:17,250
And then you choose your free plan as you can see it asks for an e-mail and the password and other details

31
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:24,720
as well so provide your e-mail password provide your mail address and the postal code and the city and

32
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:32,610
the country and of to clicking these buttons clicking these checkboxes actually you can just say sign

33
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:35,540
up and create your account.

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:39,070
I'm not going to do that because I already have an account.

35
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:42,380
I'm going to be logging in instead.

36
00:02:42,390 --> 00:02:47,130
So if I say sign in it will bring me a dashboard like this.

37
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:51,150
So when you sign up it will bring your dashboard like this.

38
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:56,110
And in here this is called Control Panel dashboard.

39
00:02:56,310 --> 00:02:59,460
And we have our own API access key.

40
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:01,360
So this is kind of important.

41
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,530
We're going to use this in order to get data.

42
00:03:04,910 --> 00:03:11,010
If you see an empty string in here or a like an empty box.

43
00:03:11,010 --> 00:03:16,620
You can always click or reset to get one of these API access keys.

44
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:17,410
OK.

45
00:03:17,490 --> 00:03:23,930
So this is our dashboard and we have a small menu in here like you can upgrade your account.

46
00:03:23,940 --> 00:03:26,680
You can just choose a subscription plan.

47
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:30,990
You can change your details from your account page and everything OK.

48
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,220
But right now we're interested in this quick start guide or documentation.

49
00:03:36,330 --> 00:03:43,050
So if you click one of these like documentation it will take you through a web page in which you can

50
00:03:43,050 --> 00:03:45,240
find the details of this API.

51
00:03:46,380 --> 00:03:52,960
And of course I'm going to show you how to work with this but you will need this.

52
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:53,940
You're out.

53
00:03:54,390 --> 00:03:55,210
OK.

54
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:03,870
As you can see this is the URL that we want to go if we want to get the data and then we get the data

55
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:07,500
like here in the API response.

56
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,260
We're going to be seeing adjacent data.

57
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:13,620
So this is how it looks like.

58
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:21,210
So this is kind of adjacent format and here as you can see we have different values and it looks like

59
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:24,450
some key value pairings in there right.

60
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:24,810
Right.

61
00:04:24,810 --> 00:04:28,590
So this is kind of key and this is value.

62
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:30,000
So this is key.

63
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,250
This is value.

64
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,700
And as you can see we got the boolean we got an integer we got string we got a string again and we got

65
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:39,370
an error.

66
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:47,760
So we have some various values inside of a string to any dictionary in here as you can see.

67
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,320
And we're going to use that information later on.

68
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,060
So it's important to understand your Jason format.

69
00:04:56,070 --> 00:05:04,430
It's important to understand what your data will look like once you get it and this is the response

70
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:07,820
this is going to be our response from this web page.

71
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,230
But before we get this response We have to create a request.

72
00:05:13,340 --> 00:05:19,820
So in here in this section you're going to learn a lot of new things a lot of new codes a lot of new

73
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:21,030
techniques.

74
00:05:21,090 --> 00:05:28,460
Remember that we're trying to get this response and in order to get this response We have to create

75
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:29,570
a request.

76
00:05:29,720 --> 00:05:38,210
We have to go to a new URL to reach that data and the URL is written in here.

77
00:05:38,210 --> 00:05:41,300
If you copy and paste this into your browser.

78
00:05:41,330 --> 00:05:42,100
OK.

79
00:05:42,140 --> 00:05:45,280
This is the data that I'm copying right now.

80
00:05:45,410 --> 00:05:53,600
If I paste this over here it will ask me for my api key before providing that API key make sure you

81
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:56,440
delete the spaces between these words.

82
00:05:56,450 --> 00:05:56,830
OK.

83
00:05:56,830 --> 00:06:05,660
You don't want a space in here in order not to get any error and then delete does API key and replace

84
00:06:05,660 --> 00:06:07,880
it with your own API key.

85
00:06:07,910 --> 00:06:14,570
So let me go back and copy mine from here OK and let me delete.

86
00:06:14,570 --> 00:06:19,160
Does API key and paste my own API key in here.

87
00:06:19,340 --> 00:06:22,850
And as you can see we get as a result in here.

88
00:06:22,850 --> 00:06:23,210
OK.

89
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:26,470
So this is what we are looking for.

90
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:32,810
So these are the exact steps that we are going to replicate in our own app.

91
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:40,460
So we're going to go into this you're all using of course programmatic way so we're going to create

92
00:06:40,460 --> 00:06:42,770
a request inside of our app.

93
00:06:42,770 --> 00:06:44,630
The app will go here.

94
00:06:44,660 --> 00:06:53,060
It will go to does your URL and app will get this data and display it for us of course after getting

95
00:06:53,150 --> 00:06:59,300
this data we have to process it so that we can be ready to display to the user.

96
00:06:59,330 --> 00:07:07,250
But right now you know the exact steps that we're going to do so let's stop here and within the next

97
00:07:07,250 --> 00:07:11,540
lecture we're going to create our project and start working on it.
