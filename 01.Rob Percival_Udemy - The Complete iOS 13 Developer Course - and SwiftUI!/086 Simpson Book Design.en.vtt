00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:01.570
Hi.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:09.300
Following this lecture we going to create a Simpson book app and this will be similar to our landmark

3
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:09.930
book.

4
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:16.350
But this time we're not going to use some random eraser we're not going to create multiple arrays but

5
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:24.090
rather we're just going to go for models and we're going to use classes in order to create this Simpson

6
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:28.620
models and display them in table view controllers.

7
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:32.310
So I'm going to go for AOS and single view app.

8
00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:34.870
So we've done that testing.

9
00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:37.240
We're just going to build this real app.

10
00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:44.500
So I'm going to call the Simpson book and we're not going to check the swift UI or core data.

11
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:51.500
So I'm going to head next and I'm going to save this in my AOS complete folder.

12
00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:55.630
So we're going to start with designing this app.

13
00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:56.570
OK.

14
00:00:56.880 --> 00:01:02.040
Let me make this into a full screen mode so we can't see better.

15
00:01:02.520 --> 00:01:11.940
And I'm going to go ahead and jump to mean that storyboard because I'm going to have a very simple design

16
00:01:11.940 --> 00:01:13.080
in here as well.

17
00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:20.070
I'm going to have a two weave controllers in which I will show the Simpson names in first table we have

18
00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.030
controller and then the second view controller I'm just going to show the image of the Simpson and name

19
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:29.940
and job of the Simpson as well.

20
00:01:31.080 --> 00:01:36.270
So in the fresh weave controller we're going to have our table view as usual.

21
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:37.300
Right.

22
00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.100
So how can we add a table view to here.

23
00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:45.670
So let's go to a library and find our table to use.

24
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:53.310
So click on this plus button and just search for table view and drag and drop one table view over here

25
00:01:54.370 --> 00:01:58.380
and this will stretch out all the way to the edges.

26
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.640
And remember there's a good way to do that.

27
00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.760
How can we do that.

28
00:02:02.770 --> 00:02:05.230
We can give you a zero constraint.

29
00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:10.010
So let me go to this manually constraint menu.

30
00:02:10.630 --> 00:02:18.280
And here I will just give zero to these all constraints and I will say add four constraints and it will

31
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:21.950
just stretch out all the way to the edges.

32
00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.410
So that's good.

33
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:28.660
That's all I have to have in my first we have a controller.

34
00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:36.970
Now I will have a second view controller in which I will display the image of the Simpson and name and

35
00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:40.180
job of the Simpson selected Simpson.

36
00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:48.700
OK so this is going to be exactly like landmark book where we choose one of the Simpson's to display

37
00:02:48.910 --> 00:02:51.250
the details of that Simpson.

38
00:02:51.340 --> 00:02:57.370
So if you want you can have another team for your app as well like in landmark book.

39
00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.490
So let me create the other wheel controller here as well.

40
00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:09.790
So let me just go and search for a view and it will bring me up the weave controller just drag and drop

41
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:11.060
here.

42
00:03:11.110 --> 00:03:12.600
OK.

43
00:03:12.610 --> 00:03:13.600
And later on.

44
00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:20.870
Remember when we have a navigation bar inside of this view controller if we connect this to we have

45
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.350
controllers together with a Segway.

46
00:03:23.350 --> 00:03:24.680
Show Segway.

47
00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:31.060
It means that this view controller will get the navigation bar too so that we will have an automatically

48
00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:35.340
created back by them in which we can go back and forth.

49
00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:44.140
So right now I'm going to choose this we controller and go to Ed and I'm going to go for embed in and

50
00:03:44.140 --> 00:03:47.290
say navigation controller.

51
00:03:47.380 --> 00:03:50.710
So this will not be seen in my real app.

52
00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:58.090
This is just the navigation controller and it added the navigation bar in my view controller.

53
00:03:58.210 --> 00:04:05.770
So while I have to do right now is just to create a Segway between this view controllers so that we

54
00:04:05.770 --> 00:04:09.250
will have the same in here as well.

55
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:16.960
So select those yellow dot and control drag to here and select show Segway.

56
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:24.220
And here as you can see I have my navigation bar and I have my back button right now.

57
00:04:24.220 --> 00:04:28.870
So before we proceed we have to do an identifier to disagree.

58
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:29.480
Right.

59
00:04:29.500 --> 00:04:32.830
So click on this and make sure that you clicked on the Segway.

60
00:04:32.830 --> 00:04:40.840
You can click from here hierarchy as well and go to attributes and do an identifier.

61
00:04:40.840 --> 00:04:45.730
So generally I prefer to do this like two details we see.

62
00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.390
OK.

63
00:04:46.840 --> 00:04:55.480
So define the near weave controllers name and say to this we have controller and there is another combination

64
00:04:55.570 --> 00:05:01.440
saying that from view controller to second view controller or something like that.

65
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:08.410
So next what I'm going to have in this view controller is an image of you first in which I will display

66
00:05:08.410 --> 00:05:11.910
the image of the chosen Simpson right.

67
00:05:12.130 --> 00:05:16.800
And then I'm going to display the name of the Simpson.

68
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:24.560
So I don't have to change any attributes of Image view I believe I can go ahead and add my labels.

69
00:05:24.790 --> 00:05:33.110
So search for a label and drag one from here and let me zoom in a little bit so we can see better.

70
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:40.570
Let me make this a little bit bigger because we will need some space right.

71
00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:44.170
We can have some long Simpson names.

72
00:05:44.290 --> 00:05:50.950
Make sure that this is centrally aligned and this will be our name label.

73
00:05:51.070 --> 00:05:59.110
Of course you may not choose to write name label in here OK but I'm just going to write it anyway so

74
00:05:59.110 --> 00:06:04.300
that we will see where our name label is located.

75
00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:05.710
So this is the name label.

76
00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:15.040
And if I copy and pasted that comment see and comment V I can drag and drop a new label here and say

77
00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.590
this is job labels.

78
00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.290
So we're going to display the job of the Simpson here as well.

79
00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:22.950
So that's it.

80
00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:31.960
We have created our design but now I have to create a new controller and assign it to be the DOT swift

81
00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:41.140
file of this new wave controller so that we can actually define those views into programming section.

82
00:06:41.140 --> 00:06:49.100
So I believe we should go for creating that swift file first so that we can connect it to our new controller.

83
00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:57.720
So come over here with right click say new file and we gonna go for Coco touch class so hit max.

84
00:06:57.930 --> 00:07:02.750
And here as you can see this is not UI wheel controller in my case.

85
00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:09.430
Make sure that this is UI real controller OK so we are not looking for UI table view.

86
00:07:09.510 --> 00:07:11.100
So this is UI.

87
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:19.590
We have controller and Regan to how to choose Swift of course and I'm going to name these details we

88
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:22.770
see as details view controller.

89
00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:28.710
So now I can hit next and make sure that Target is selected and create this file.

90
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:32.720
So this will add a new dot swift file here.

91
00:07:32.850 --> 00:07:42.240
So let me get rid of this comment section OK and let me put this up here and we going to start with

92
00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.050
table view and then later on the other views as well.

93
00:07:46.830 --> 00:07:57.310
So let me go to main that storyboard and of course we're going to have to say that open does new editor

94
00:07:57.760 --> 00:08:02.260
from here and select view controller dot Swift.

95
00:08:02.470 --> 00:08:03.430
OK.

96
00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:08.010
And then we can come over here and define our table to you.

97
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:16.470
And actually we forgot to synchronize the view controller dot Swift that the second view controller

98
00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.080
so we're going to do that in the identity inspector over here.

99
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:23.780
But this is already defined for first view controller.

100
00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:30.490
So let me do that with controlled dreck so we can drag and drop here and I'm going to go for a table

101
00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.860
view right.

102
00:08:31.870 --> 00:08:40.030
This is OK and we're going to have to do this synchronizing thing for a second view controller because

103
00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:42.480
that's all we need in the first one.

104
00:08:42.490 --> 00:08:51.460
So let me come over here and hit on this yellow dot or hit on this view controller in order to just

105
00:08:51.490 --> 00:08:52.090
a sign.

106
00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:53.800
Details we see to this.

107
00:08:53.980 --> 00:08:56.140
We have a controller right.

108
00:08:56.170 --> 00:09:00.520
So in order to do that you have to go to these attributes Inspector.

109
00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:03.450
One more time and choose class.

110
00:09:03.460 --> 00:09:05.700
And let me find details we see.

111
00:09:05.890 --> 00:09:15.430
And now these two are synchronized so I can define those values define those views into my weave controller

112
00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:16.260
file.

113
00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:23.230
So choose this view controller file and hit details we see so that we see details we see.

114
00:09:23.230 --> 00:09:28.810
So now this is details we see and I'm trying to import as into details we see.

115
00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:31.330
So this is working right.

116
00:09:31.540 --> 00:09:33.850
I'm going to code this image view.

117
00:09:34.210 --> 00:09:36.520
And here we have the name label.

118
00:09:36.520 --> 00:09:36.870
OK.

119
00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.970
Drag and drop name label.

120
00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.190
OK.

121
00:09:41.290 --> 00:09:43.280
And we have a job label as well.

122
00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:49.260
I'm doing this kind of fast because we have been doing this so far for many times.

123
00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:55.260
I believe you're comfortable with that kind of operation right now.

124
00:09:55.330 --> 00:09:56.290
So here we go.

125
00:09:56.290 --> 00:09:58.360
We are done with designing our app.

126
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.900
We are dying done that defining our reviews.

127
00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:07.050
So let me give the constraints here reset to suggested constraints.

128
00:10:07.180 --> 00:10:11.330
OK so that we can forget about the mean that storyboard.

129
00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:17.470
And we can go back to our code and start writing our models.

130
00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:20.680
So let me go to we have controller dots first.

131
00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:26.770
And here we are going to create the model and we are going to pass this information in here to display

132
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.900
the details.

133
00:10:28.900 --> 00:10:35.400
I believe this has gone too far so we're going to stop here and not make this into a real long lecture.

134
00:10:35.440 --> 00:10:39.330
Rather we are going to continue within the next lecture.
