00:00:00,750 --> 00:00:01,550
Hi.

2
00:00:01,630 --> 00:00:04,620
We didn't lecture we going to start building our feet.

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:11,250
We have controllers so that we can retrieve those data from fires start to display them to the user.

4
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:17,500
And right now we didn't inside of our field we have controller we don't even have a prototype so.

5
00:00:17,630 --> 00:00:22,680
So I'm going to increase this to one and I'm going to create my prototype cell.

6
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:24,240
So you know how this works.

7
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,950
We have done it in the Instagram clone section right.

8
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:37,830
We're going to have only one big image over here displaying the image of the user the one of the snaps

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:38,900
of the users.

10
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,490
And on the top of that I'm going to show you the user name.

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:52,530
So lets me call this something like user name for right now just to be sure that this is the user name

12
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:53,300
label.

13
00:00:53,310 --> 00:00:55,200
So let me make this central.

14
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,310
And here you go.

15
00:00:56,310 --> 00:00:57,910
I believe that's good.

16
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:04,170
And we need another thing and this is image for you because we're going to display one of the snaps

17
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,690
in our post over here.

18
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:07,430
OK.

19
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:13,740
So we can make this as bigger as we want because we're only going to display this image and the user

20
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:14,850
name anyway.

21
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:16,280
OK.

22
00:01:16,440 --> 00:01:17,870
So I believe that's good.

23
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,170
We will have this huge image showing up in our feet.

24
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,950
So I'm going to give this some who you say are suggests its constraints and I'm going to give a V then

25
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:29,910
height.

26
00:01:29,910 --> 00:01:31,800
OK so here you go.

27
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:36,300
Now we are ready to create a new feed cell.

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:39,570
So let me come over here on say new file.

29
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:43,140
I'm doing this kind of fast because we know how this works.

30
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:52,260
So I'm going to go over my cocoa attach glass and I'm going to search for UI table view so ok not controller

31
00:01:52,260 --> 00:01:53,180
about so.

32
00:01:53,190 --> 00:02:01,170
So this will be our feed cell so that I can have a class at cocoa touch class in order to assign it

33
00:02:01,170 --> 00:02:03,740
to my newly created cell.

34
00:02:03,780 --> 00:02:06,010
So let's bring this in.

35
00:02:06,150 --> 00:02:12,870
And I believe by mistake I put it on there we have controllers even though it's just a view but I'm

36
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:14,960
not going to bother with that.

37
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:15,450
OK.

38
00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:18,390
We know it's just sitting right there.

39
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,360
So let me come over to my cell.

40
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:21,870
OK.

41
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:23,680
This one table we use cell.

42
00:02:23,810 --> 00:02:27,850
And if you go to identity Inspector you can choose the feed cell.

43
00:02:28,050 --> 00:02:31,340
And over here you had to give it an identifier as well.

44
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:32,760
I'm going to call it cell.

45
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:37,260
And then we have to bring those views in.

46
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,430
So let me come over here and in the assistant editor I'm going to go for our feed cell and over here

47
00:02:44,460 --> 00:02:46,950
I'm going to bring in this image view.

48
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:50,570
I'm going to call this feed Image view.

49
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:51,570
OK.

50
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:57,650
And connect it and we're getting the same error that we have gotten previously.

51
00:02:57,650 --> 00:03:03,950
So I believe we have to close this down and open it one more time to let it index.

52
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:11,410
So it's kind of an X gold bug but it's it just doesn't interfere with our work too much.

53
00:03:11,430 --> 00:03:14,220
So I believe they will resolve it anyway.

54
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:22,470
So once you open them restart it's it will start indexing and once it completes you can try to bring

55
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:26,280
this in one more time and call it feed the Image view.

56
00:03:26,340 --> 00:03:28,250
And here you go now it's working.

57
00:03:28,950 --> 00:03:31,920
And then we're going to do the same thing for label as well.

58
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:39,650
So bring in the label and I'm going to call this feed label OK or feed the user name label.

59
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:40,950
So that's good.

60
00:03:41,100 --> 00:03:46,740
So let me close this down and let me go to my feed we have controller.

61
00:03:46,860 --> 00:03:47,820
OK.

62
00:03:48,090 --> 00:03:51,540
Because we don't even have the table view set up yet.

63
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:58,240
So let me do these steps as well so I'm going to say this this table view delegates.

64
00:03:58,290 --> 00:03:58,740
OK.

65
00:03:58,740 --> 00:04:03,500
And also you I table view data source so remember how this works.

66
00:04:03,510 --> 00:04:08,840
We have done it like a million times so I believe you can do it yourself as well.

67
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:15,400
So table we've got delegate self table view that's data source is self as well.

68
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:19,230
After we do that we have to call two functions.

69
00:04:19,230 --> 00:04:23,360
I'm going to call number of rallies in section first.

70
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:27,240
And we need s for all with index path.

71
00:04:27,420 --> 00:04:30,550
So far right now I'm just going to call the return 10.

72
00:04:30,650 --> 00:04:31,800
And now we're here.

73
00:04:31,800 --> 00:04:39,660
We're going to create the cell and the cell will come from table view the D Q your reusable cell and

74
00:04:39,660 --> 00:04:47,070
it will ask us for an identifier and an index path and the identifier yourself and index path is index

75
00:04:47,070 --> 00:04:47,700
path.

76
00:04:47,760 --> 00:04:55,030
And of course I'm going to first cast this as feed so so that I can I reach the label an Image view

77
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:55,980
over here.

78
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,280
OK.

79
00:04:57,360 --> 00:04:59,860
So right now I cannot reach that.

80
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:05,030
So let me do a comment B and return this cell.

81
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,050
OK.

82
00:05:06,070 --> 00:05:11,790
So that I can come over here and say Soledad and I can reach as you can see.

83
00:05:11,890 --> 00:05:19,800
So in fact let me just called is feed user so lame label and just make it equal to test.

84
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,020
OK.

85
00:05:21,040 --> 00:05:28,020
And of course I cannot do that I have to say Soledad feed user name label dot text.

86
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:28,870
So here you go.

87
00:05:28,870 --> 00:05:33,970
Now we are ready to use our table view inside of forward coat.

88
00:05:33,970 --> 00:05:38,380
So let me do a command B to make this error go away.

89
00:05:38,380 --> 00:05:39,100
OK.

90
00:05:39,190 --> 00:05:42,640
Now we're ready to write our retrieval function.

91
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:46,650
So I'm going to call this get snaps from fi your store.

92
00:05:46,660 --> 00:05:47,130
OK.

93
00:05:47,140 --> 00:05:48,820
Or via your base.

94
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:56,930
So let me open up curly brace over here and I'm going to call this function over here so what do we

95
00:05:56,930 --> 00:06:01,020
want here of course we want to create other steps.

96
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:01,340
Right.

97
00:06:01,340 --> 00:06:07,970
So we're going to get our snaps and we're going to pass this information to display our steps.

98
00:06:08,330 --> 00:06:09,350
So let me do that.

99
00:06:09,350 --> 00:06:17,300
I'm just going to call this forest or database that collection and this time we don't need to have any

100
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:25,760
filters over here because we're going to display all the snaps but we have this data value so maybe

101
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:33,640
we want to order by this date so that we can see the most recent one as the first SAP.

102
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:40,220
So I'm going to say order by and I'm going to choose this descending boolean as well because this will

103
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:41,270
be descending.

104
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:41,720
Yep.

105
00:06:42,020 --> 00:06:45,430
So I'm going to call this date and descending will be true.

106
00:06:45,590 --> 00:06:51,590
And then later on I can just get my data and this time I'm not going to say get data about I'm just

107
00:06:51,590 --> 00:06:58,640
going to add a snapshot listener because I want to get the updated information here as well.

108
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:05,330
So if you say at snapshot listener and hit enter it will give you either a snapshot or an error.

109
00:07:05,450 --> 00:07:12,920
OK so let me close this down and here over here I'm going to check to see if error is not no and if

110
00:07:12,920 --> 00:07:19,610
that's the case I'm going to call my make Ellard function and say error and message will be error that

111
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,200
localized description.

112
00:07:21,200 --> 00:07:22,000
OK.

113
00:07:22,070 --> 00:07:30,740
So don't forget to put call here the question marks and I'm going to say error soap else if that's the

114
00:07:30,740 --> 00:07:31,150
case.

115
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:37,040
What I want to do to get this information and display them in the table view.

116
00:07:37,040 --> 00:07:39,250
So let me do the checks first.

117
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:47,920
So I'm going to control to see if snapshot that is M.S. is false and if snapshot is not Neil.

118
00:07:47,980 --> 00:07:48,690
OK.

119
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:54,860
If that's the case of course I'm going to go into a for loop and I'm going to say for a document in

120
00:07:55,130 --> 00:07:57,510
snapshot that documents.

121
00:07:57,530 --> 00:07:58,180
OK.

122
00:07:58,190 --> 00:08:00,660
And this will give me the documents.

123
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:08,090
Now I can reach the snap owner I can reach the image you're all array and I can reach the data as well.

124
00:08:08,510 --> 00:08:15,440
But so far we have been just getting this information and saving those information into arrays so that

125
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,440
we can display them in our table views.

126
00:08:19,550 --> 00:08:26,180
But this time I'm not going to do that but rather I'm going to create a snap model using trucks.

127
00:08:26,180 --> 00:08:28,700
Let's do that within the next lecture.
