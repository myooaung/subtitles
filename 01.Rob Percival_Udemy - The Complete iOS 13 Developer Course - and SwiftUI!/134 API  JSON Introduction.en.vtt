Hi within this section we're going to learn about API and Jason formats and in order to do that we are

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.680
going to build a currency called merger.

3
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:19.950
So with using API and Jason we going to get some data from Internet so that we can display them to the

4
00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.470
user after processing this data.

5
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:30.870
So this is a big thing for us because right now we're entering into the Internet world.

6
00:00:30.870 --> 00:00:31.470
OK.

7
00:00:31.620 --> 00:00:37.960
After this section we're going to focus on working vet called servers as well.

8
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:43.990
But this will be an entry point for us in order to interact with internet data.

9
00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:47.270
So now if you're ready let's get started.
