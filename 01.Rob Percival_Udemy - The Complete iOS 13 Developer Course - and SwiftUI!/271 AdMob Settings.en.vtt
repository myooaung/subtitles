00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:08.070
Hi within this lecture re going to see how we can create an advertisement a count from Google and how

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:16.710
we can integrate those SD KS into our project to show an ad to the user so that we can make a money

3
00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:18.560
out of our apps.

4
00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:25.530
So I'm going to create a new test project in order to do that but of course you can't do that with your

5
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.610
own projects if you have a finished project that you want to bring an ad in you can work on that as

6
00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:33.430
well.

7
00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:41.850
So I'm going to name this Google ad MAP test and we're going to use this ad map structure in order to

8
00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:43.800
show advertisements.

9
00:00:43.830 --> 00:00:45.920
So let me create this project.

10
00:00:45.950 --> 00:00:46.910
Okay.

11
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:54.780
And we're not going to do much in this project in fact we're only going to have only one button in which

12
00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:03.450
we will display some advertisements to the users when they click on the button to go into the next step

13
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:11.260
or next we have control or next level of a game for example they will see a full screen size at.

14
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:13.130
So that's what I'm going to do.

15
00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.470
I'm just going to bring in one button.

16
00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:23.010
I'm not going to make it so complicated because we're going to focus on advertisements and we have learned

17
00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:28.640
how to do other things like creating second screens and stuff.

18
00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:34.890
So let me bring in this button and let me name this something like next.

19
00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:40.860
So let me make this a little bit bigger and put it in the center of the screen right.

20
00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.590
And I'm going to name this next.

21
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:53.010
And supposedly our user will just hit on this next button to go into the next screen but I'm going to

22
00:01:53.010 --> 00:01:55.420
show them an ad first.

23
00:01:55.650 --> 00:02:01.590
So let me open my weave controller and let me bring in this next button.

24
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.130
So I'm going to call this next clicked.

25
00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:05.510
OK.

26
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:10.030
So that's where we're going to show our ads.

27
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:18.060
So first of all I don't need to do anything here because first of all I need to bring in my as the case.

28
00:02:18.060 --> 00:02:21.090
And before we do that we need to create an account.

29
00:02:21.090 --> 00:02:27.110
So let me go to Google and we're going to search for ad mob IRS.

30
00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:27.960
OK.

31
00:02:28.260 --> 00:02:32.310
So ad mob IO Us this one.

32
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:36.000
So if you hit enter you will see like Amelia results.

33
00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.740
But we want the first one.

34
00:02:38.250 --> 00:02:39.690
So this is what we want.

35
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:42.390
Developers dot google dot com.

36
00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:45.530
So this is again a service by Google.

37
00:02:46.170 --> 00:02:53.190
And if somehow you end up in the first page of this Google ad mob of course you can click on us link

38
00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:57.600
to go into our IOW main page as well.

39
00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:04.320
And since Google is one of the biggest advertisers in the world we will have no problem finding ads

40
00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:07.110
for our apps using this ad map.

41
00:03:07.140 --> 00:03:07.470
OK.

42
00:03:07.500 --> 00:03:10.980
So that's why we're working with Google right now.

43
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:18.990
And as you can see if you're using firebase you have to use another SDK as instructed in here.

44
00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.430
So Google actually owns fly your base and ads map.

45
00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:28.070
So these two services synchronize together very well.

46
00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:34.750
So if you're working with five your base you have to work with another part and 90 percent of what we're

47
00:03:34.770 --> 00:03:36.590
going to do is the same actually.

48
00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:45.960
But rather than using the Google mobile ads SDK you have to use Firebase ad mob SDK in order to reach

49
00:03:46.260 --> 00:03:48.750
the same solution.

50
00:03:48.780 --> 00:03:54.750
But in here I'm just going to assume that you're not using fi you're raising your app and I will show

51
00:03:54.750 --> 00:04:03.150
you how to work with mobile ads SDK and after watching this section you will be able to adjust it so

52
00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.640
that you can use it in your file your basic count as well.

53
00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:11.400
Just following the instructions over here easily.

54
00:04:11.490 --> 00:04:15.080
So come over here and as you can see we have some prerequisites.

55
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.860
And it says that you have to create an ad mob account and register your app in order to start working.

56
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:25.800
So that's what we were going to do.

57
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:29.680
So let me open this create an ad mob account link.

58
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:30.600
OK.

59
00:04:30.630 --> 00:04:33.810
And here you will be asked some questions.

60
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:40.160
So it says that do you have an ad sense a count or do you have on the Google ads a count.

61
00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:43.710
So I will assume you don't have any of those.

62
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:51.510
So we are going to start from scratch and if you open this it will give you a link called apps that

63
00:04:51.630 --> 00:05:01.520
add mob dot com and you have to go to that link and give your Country Time Zone and preferred Carisi.

64
00:05:01.620 --> 00:05:08.050
OK so let me open this link and it's very easy to sign up since I already have an account.

65
00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:14.930
It will open my account directly but you can't just sign in with your gmail account or Google account

66
00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:21.740
and if you don't have any Gmail account yet please open one so that you can use it in Firebase and add

67
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.210
map as well.

68
00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.550
And then you can provide your country time zone and preferred currency so that you can create your add

69
00:05:29.550 --> 00:05:33.380
maybe account and you can start working on it.

70
00:05:33.410 --> 00:05:41.480
So once you do that it will bring you a page like this as you can see I have a test app installed in

71
00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:45.200
my edX map and as you can see my account is approved.

72
00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:52.130
So if this is the first time that you're creating this account they may ask some documentation to prove

73
00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:57.230
that you're really the person that you claim to be after you do that.

74
00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:03.530
Like if you provide your bank account details or if you provide your passport number or something it

75
00:06:03.530 --> 00:06:08.730
will be approved so that you can start earning money out of Google.

76
00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.170
Okay.

77
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:12.350
So here we see this statistic of my app.

78
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:14.710
And as you can see it doesn't make any money.

79
00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:20.600
So I believe it's just a failing over here but it's just a test app.

80
00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:25.610
So what do you want to do is to he come over here I say add a new app.

81
00:06:25.730 --> 00:06:30.440
Once you do that it will ask you if you have already published your app.

82
00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:37.430
And in my case it's not published so I'm going to say no if it's published it will ask you for App Store

83
00:06:37.430 --> 00:06:46.480
idea or Google Play I.D. So my name my app name will be something like app Google App Store test ok

84
00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:48.270
or add more tests.

85
00:06:48.440 --> 00:06:55.130
So I'm going to call this Google ad more U.S. test and platform is IRS of course.

86
00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:01.060
And it will just create the app and it will give me something called app I.D..

87
00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:04.400
So this is what I need to make money.

88
00:07:04.580 --> 00:07:11.390
So I need to use this in my code so that I can relate my ads with my own app.

89
00:07:11.700 --> 00:07:19.630
OK so either take a copy take note of this or just copy it because we are going to use it later on.

90
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:27.620
And if you say create an ad unit it will give you some page to create ad units and this will give you

91
00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:29.860
some ideas to use in your app.

92
00:07:29.990 --> 00:07:33.820
But I'm not going to do that now if you click on it.

93
00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:38.690
It's very easy you can just choose an ad format and create it.

94
00:07:38.690 --> 00:07:43.540
We are going to see what our ad formats and where you're going to see how we can do that later on.

95
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:51.380
But right now I just want to move forward because in order to do that I need to get the SD KS into my

96
00:07:51.380 --> 00:08:01.130
X code project and start connecting my X code project with my ADD MORE account so that I can integrate

97
00:08:01.190 --> 00:08:04.760
all these apps into my app.

98
00:08:04.910 --> 00:08:13.460
So let's close this down and my app is already installed over here so I can see the details and once

99
00:08:13.460 --> 00:08:16.880
I am ready I can come over here to create ad units.

100
00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:19.440
OK so let's continue.

101
00:08:19.460 --> 00:08:26.110
As you can see it asks us to bring in some parts so we know how this works right.

102
00:08:26.120 --> 00:08:31.800
We need to create a pod file and copy this into our pod file to install it.

103
00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.140
So let's do that.

104
00:08:33.140 --> 00:08:40.700
In fact let me close this down rather than minimizing it because we're going to work with our pod file.

105
00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.610
And let me open my terminal and make this a little bit bigger since you know how this works.

106
00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:49.070
I'm going to be quick over here.

107
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:52.460
You know how to work with terminal at this point I believe.

108
00:08:52.460 --> 00:09:00.600
So I'm going to go into my folder and it's in the IO is complete and it's in the Google ad test.

109
00:09:00.650 --> 00:09:07.790
So once I'm over here I can run part of it and it will create a path file for me.

110
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:13.480
So let me go and find my path file in my folders as well.

111
00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:15.440
So let me come over here.

112
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:16.940
Yep that is the one.

113
00:09:16.940 --> 00:09:21.240
So let me open this with text edit and here you go.

114
00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:28.950
Now wi fi make does a little bit bigger we can't see better and under this use frameworks.

115
00:09:28.970 --> 00:09:32.320
I can just paste in what I have copied.

116
00:09:32.450 --> 00:09:37.730
So let me save this and let me around of the install.

117
00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:40.730
So this will create the path for me.

118
00:09:40.730 --> 00:09:45.890
This will download the pod for me and integrate in my project.

119
00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:50.020
So let me go back to documentation while it happens.

120
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:57.850
And after we're done with our download process we are going to have to take care of our info that people

121
00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:03.290
list as well harder to connect our project with our Ed mob account.

122
00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.940
So this is what we have to do.

123
00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:10.100
This is what we have to add to our team for the police.

124
00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:12.480
And where are you going to do it in the source code.

125
00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:21.150
So we have to get our app I.D. from this my bank account as well in order to do that.

126
00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.060
So let me see.

127
00:10:22.060 --> 00:10:22.350
Yep.

128
00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:23.290
It's downloaded.

129
00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.830
So let me open my projects over here OK.

130
00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:34.930
And since now it's already integrated in my project I'm going to go ahead to my info that P list and

131
00:10:35.050 --> 00:10:38.210
add this line into my info that people list.

132
00:10:38.230 --> 00:10:41.430
So let me copy all of the things from here.

133
00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:42.510
OK.

134
00:10:42.550 --> 00:10:51.670
And we haven't seen the change of the source code before we have worked with regular info that P list

135
00:10:51.670 --> 00:10:52.400
way.

136
00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:55.270
But right now we're going to change this passcode.

137
00:10:55.300 --> 00:11:02.200
So let me cope with this and go back here and right click on my info the p list and say source code

138
00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:04.460
rather than property list.

139
00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:13.700
So here here you see the example like the representation of the info the p lists rather than its regular

140
00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:21.970
representation so you can just paste this JDL application identifier and you can come over here to appropriate

141
00:11:21.970 --> 00:11:29.700
to list and you can see this is integrated into my info that P listed as it is.

142
00:11:29.710 --> 00:11:32.360
So this is what we have to change really.

143
00:11:32.380 --> 00:11:35.830
So let me come back to our settings.

144
00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:38.460
Oh not the actual settings.

145
00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:41.670
In fact we have to go inside of the app.

146
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:42.250
Okay.

147
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:47.710
Rather than this publisher idea we want the idea of the app itself.

148
00:11:47.710 --> 00:11:57.010
So let me go back to our home and inside of our app and in the app you have to find these settings of

149
00:11:57.010 --> 00:11:58.480
the app itself.

150
00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:02.540
So here is our app I.D. so you can copy it from here.

151
00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:12.850
I'm pasted in this info that P lists file but I'm not going to do that because if we do that these ads

152
00:12:13.030 --> 00:12:14.460
won't show up.

153
00:12:14.530 --> 00:12:23.080
We can't test that because this app I.D. is only active once we installed the app to the App Store and

154
00:12:23.170 --> 00:12:27.000
even we have to wait 24 hours to be active.

155
00:12:27.430 --> 00:12:35.350
So rather than using this app idea I'm going to use the test I.D. that is given to me over here so that

156
00:12:35.350 --> 00:12:37.350
I can test my ads.

157
00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:43.560
So I'm going to cope with this and I'm going to change it back to this original test I.D..

158
00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:51.280
But before uploading your app to the App Store don't forget it because until you change it to your real

159
00:12:51.340 --> 00:12:56.890
app I.D. You won't be able to connect your app to your real adamant account.
