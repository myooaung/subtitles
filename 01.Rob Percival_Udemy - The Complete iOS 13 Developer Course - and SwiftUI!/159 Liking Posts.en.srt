00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:01,570
Hi.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,770
We didn't this lecture regrowing to finish our like function.

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:12,420
We going to use this like label and document I.D. label in order to get related information for our

4
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:13,720
like function.

5
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:21,450
So all we have to do is just increase dislikes by one and upload devalue to the server in order to do

6
00:00:21,450 --> 00:00:21,740
that.

7
00:00:21,750 --> 00:00:25,990
Of course we are going to import firebase in the feed cell as well.

8
00:00:26,180 --> 00:00:27,170
OK.

9
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:35,010
And in the Like button clicked function I'm going to call this fi your store database like we did before.

10
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,040
So it will drive from the fire store that fire store.

11
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:38,400
OK.

12
00:00:38,400 --> 00:00:40,680
This is going to be our instance.

13
00:00:40,830 --> 00:00:47,390
And now I can come over here and say fi your store database that's collection.

14
00:00:47,490 --> 00:00:48,120
OK.

15
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:50,200
And collection will be passed.

16
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:56,330
And if I say that document it will ask me for a document path.

17
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,230
So now if I get one off the document I.D. like this one.

18
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:02,300
Okay.

19
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:11,010
And if I put that document I.D. in here whatever I do next will be related to only these documents.

20
00:01:11,370 --> 00:01:18,720
So if I work within this document if I try to upload any value it will be only uploaded to that document

21
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:19,670
only.

22
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:21,270
So that's how you filter.

23
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:24,300
That's how you limit your operations.

24
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:25,620
And in order to get this.

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:30,150
Of course I'm going to use the document I.D. label that I have just created.

26
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:35,970
So as you can see we can do document I.D. label dot text.

27
00:01:35,980 --> 00:01:43,590
Now if I say something like that said data or get data it will only bring the current values of that

28
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:49,220
document or it will only upload data inside of that document.

29
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:56,100
So before we do that I'm going to take the like count and I'm going to do this with an if left because

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:01:59,820
we're trying to convert something into an integer.

31
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:04,510
So you will have to say int like label dot text.

32
00:02:04,890 --> 00:02:09,000
And this will bring us the current like count.

33
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:18,780
OK so let me cut this and paste the inside of this if let and inside of this if let's we have the current

34
00:02:18,780 --> 00:02:20,090
like count right.

35
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:29,190
And we want to increase it by 1 and save it inside of our file use star database in order to do that.

36
00:02:29,190 --> 00:02:34,840
Of course we have to come up with a string to any dictionary like we did before.

37
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:42,090
Even though we are going to upload only one value it asks us to create a string to any dictionary and

38
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:44,640
that's what we're going to do in here.

39
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,690
So let let's call this something like like post our like Star or I don't know like dictionary whatever

40
00:02:51,690 --> 00:02:56,140
you want and it will have the likes as key.

41
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:56,940
Okay.

42
00:02:56,970 --> 00:03:04,110
And for the value we going to have to use like count but we will increase like count by 1.

43
00:03:04,140 --> 00:03:10,770
So it will be like count plus 1 and we have to convert this as string to any.

44
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,830
So this is good right.

45
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:22,320
We're casting this as a string to any dictionary and we're going to set this to be a data inside of

46
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,010
a word.

47
00:03:23,070 --> 00:03:32,050
These fires star documents if you say set data you have to find the option that has the merge parameter.

48
00:03:32,310 --> 00:03:37,090
So merge means we're uploading this like star like dictionary.

49
00:03:37,190 --> 00:03:41,140
OK but we're merging with the existing values.

50
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:47,730
So we're going to update the likes but we're not touching the post comment dates image you're out.

51
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:57,900
If you don't do this if you don't say merge it will just delete the other values other than likes and

52
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:06,060
you will end up with a broken past broken document inside of your database so make sure you say merge

53
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:13,770
true and this is how you update the database value without breaking the other values inside of your

54
00:04:13,770 --> 00:04:16,350
file your base file your store.

55
00:04:16,530 --> 00:04:17,870
So let's try this.

56
00:04:17,880 --> 00:04:23,910
Let's open our simulator and let's see if we can like this picture.

57
00:04:23,910 --> 00:04:29,770
So as you can see the current like zero if I hit like it will increase it to 1.

58
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:31,620
And as you can see changed.

59
00:04:31,890 --> 00:04:35,470
So in here I see the likes as one as well.

60
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:37,260
So it's working right.

61
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:41,320
I can like this picture I can like this picture as well.

62
00:04:41,550 --> 00:04:43,880
And let's try the last one.

63
00:04:43,950 --> 00:04:44,960
So here you go.

64
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:48,340
Our like function is in place.

65
00:04:48,480 --> 00:04:56,790
So of course we have a kind of let down in here if I hit like more than once it will just like it more

66
00:04:56,790 --> 00:04:58,020
than once.

67
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,820
And even though we are same user in here.

68
00:05:00,830 --> 00:05:01,180
Okay.

69
00:05:01,190 --> 00:05:09,860
We are the past owner and we your liking of our own picture we get to like as many as we want.

70
00:05:09,890 --> 00:05:16,550
Of course there are alternative ways to implement like function like we can create another collection

71
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:26,550
like something like likes OK and inside of that like function we can store which user liked Veatch document.

72
00:05:26,600 --> 00:05:35,150
OK so we can keep track and we can say that if this user has like this document before then don't increase

73
00:05:35,150 --> 00:05:42,800
the count so we can have that kind of controls in real apps but I'm just implementing this like function

74
00:05:43,130 --> 00:05:51,860
as an example to show you how to use updates how to use document I.D. and how to use merge so that you

75
00:05:51,860 --> 00:05:54,430
know how to work with file your base.

76
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:59,540
Once you learn how to work with file you saw you can do whatever you want.

77
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:07,850
You may have more than 10 collections you may have more than 2000 documents maybe you may have a complex

78
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:15,370
structure but right now we to do what we have to do to understand how to use fire your base.

79
00:06:15,380 --> 00:06:20,360
So let me create another user here to test if everything works fine.

80
00:06:20,780 --> 00:06:24,900
So let me try to like this pass by James.

81
00:06:24,920 --> 00:06:27,020
As you can see it still works.

82
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:36,860
So our app can work with multiple users as it's supposed to and we can see and like the other users

83
00:06:36,860 --> 00:06:38,180
posts as well.

84
00:06:38,180 --> 00:06:45,200
So if you want to follow our collection here for example you may have one and you can actually save

85
00:06:45,200 --> 00:06:54,020
the information who is following Q so that you can only adds a filter when you try to retrieve information

86
00:06:54,020 --> 00:07:00,620
from fire bays and they can only see the pictures of the users they are following.

87
00:07:00,710 --> 00:07:08,150
Okay so for example let me upload a new picture in here and this will be seen by Lars and James and

88
00:07:08,210 --> 00:07:11,210
all other users in our app.

89
00:07:11,210 --> 00:07:16,880
So if you want to implement the follower you can do that with firebase if you want to implement a better

90
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,270
like feature you can do that with firebase base.

91
00:07:20,390 --> 00:07:25,680
If you understand how this works you can do whatever you want to do with your app.

92
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,100
So this is a very powerful tool.

93
00:07:28,130 --> 00:07:35,780
I'm sure you will understand it better than we do other clones as well so make sure you keep up with

94
00:07:35,780 --> 00:07:41,210
the cars and try to implement this features on your own while following this.

95
00:07:41,210 --> 00:07:44,750
So let's stop here and talk about security in the next lecture.
