Hi.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:09,390
We then this lecture we going to add our choose image function to our ad place we see so that the user

3
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:16,530
can tap on this picture in order to go to the photo gallery and choose an image to display in that image

4
00:00:16,530 --> 00:00:17,200
of.

5
00:00:17,350 --> 00:00:20,190
You know how to do that already right.

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,510
Because we have been doing it so far.

7
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:26,860
So I suggest you pose the video and try to do it on your own.

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:35,790
So we're going to work with this place Image view and first of all we have to make this user interaction

9
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:43,470
enabled so that the then we add a new gesture recognize there to it it gets recognized and we get to

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:46,410
call whatever function we want.

11
00:00:46,650 --> 00:00:47,460
OK.

12
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:49,420
So what I'm going to do I'm going to say.

13
00:00:49,420 --> 00:00:51,030
Place Image view.

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,470
So this one place Image view.

15
00:00:53,610 --> 00:00:54,510
That's easy.

16
00:00:54,510 --> 00:00:58,520
User interaction enabled is going to be true.

17
00:00:58,740 --> 00:00:59,760
After doing that.

18
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:01,640
Of course I can call.

19
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,470
I can create my gesture recognize there.

20
00:01:04,470 --> 00:01:07,500
So this is going to be a gesture recognized.

21
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,250
And this is going to be you.

22
00:01:09,260 --> 00:01:11,470
I tapped yes you recognize her.

23
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,850
So Target will be self.

24
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:18,750
And of course we're going to have to create a new selector function.

25
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:20,930
So let me do that over here.

26
00:01:20,940 --> 00:01:29,280
This is going to be an object to see function choose image and we can come over here I say choose image.

27
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:36,330
And after that we have to add this to our replace Image view and say add gesture you could nicer and

28
00:01:36,330 --> 00:01:38,380
the right gesture recognizable.

29
00:01:38,730 --> 00:01:45,120
So the gesture will be tap and then we recognize this gesture we're going to create you.

30
00:01:45,150 --> 00:01:51,920
I pick her image picture actually not pick her UI image pick her controller over here.

31
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:58,980
So the speaker will have the delegates of our self our current we controller.

32
00:01:59,010 --> 00:02:05,660
And of course in order to do that we have to come up over here and say this is indeed the UI image picker

33
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:07,060
controller delegate.

34
00:02:07,150 --> 00:02:13,980
And on top of it it's actually a UI navigation controller delegate sending this kind of fast because

35
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:22,520
we have done it so many times and over here we have to specify the source type as well as photo library.

36
00:02:22,770 --> 00:02:30,450
And then later on you can just call some present and present the picture animated the Why Not completion

37
00:02:30,510 --> 00:02:31,510
will be nil.

38
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:39,900
So after that we have to specify what will happen once the user choses the image in order to do that.

39
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:45,750
We're going to have to work with us not did finish launching but did finish peaking media.

40
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,590
So if you were I did finish peaking media it will just pop up.

41
00:02:49,590 --> 00:02:53,250
So this is did finish peaking media with info.

42
00:02:53,250 --> 00:02:55,680
So what are we going to do peak.

43
00:02:55,860 --> 00:03:00,060
We're going to say place Image view dots image.

44
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:07,590
We're going to peak that image from this info and this gives us a dictionary in which we will give original

45
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:15,120
image as a key and with this will give us a value and we're going to cast that value as a UI image and

46
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,400
then we going to dismiss and say completion is nil.

47
00:03:20,430 --> 00:03:27,480
So of course if you want any description to give you can come over to enfold foldout P lists and give

48
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,910
it yourself because you know how to already do that.

49
00:03:31,980 --> 00:03:37,200
So let's run this on our simulator and let's see if we can get the image.

50
00:03:37,830 --> 00:03:40,120
So let's click on the ad button.

51
00:03:40,350 --> 00:03:48,480
Let's click our over imagery while we're here and it will take us to our photo library and choose one

52
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:49,710
of the images.

53
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:50,880
And here we go.

54
00:03:50,880 --> 00:03:52,040
Now we see the image.

55
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:57,470
If I click over one more time now I can get another image as well.

56
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:05,520
Now I can write the name type on atmosphere and I can't choose any image so that I can hit next to choose

57
00:04:05,520 --> 00:04:06,010
the cartoon.

58
00:04:06,010 --> 00:04:06,960
That's right.

59
00:04:06,990 --> 00:04:14,100
Now all I have to do is just find a way to transfer all of this information to the map view so that

60
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:20,450
I can upload all of this information along with the coordinates with latitude and longitude to the PA

61
00:04:20,450 --> 00:04:21,570
server.

62
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,970
That's what we're going to do in the next lecture.
