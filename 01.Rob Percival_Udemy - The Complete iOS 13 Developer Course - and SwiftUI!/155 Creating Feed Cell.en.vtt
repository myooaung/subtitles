00:00:00.890 --> 00:00:01.520
Hi.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:08.550
We didn't this lecture regrowing to see how we can create custom cells in our table views so we can

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:12.510
display the user's whatever we want in our table views.

4
00:00:12.540 --> 00:00:15.790
So far we have been displaying only texts.

5
00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:23.250
Remember we created cells and we have said that sale that tax labeled text is this.

6
00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:31.530
But this time we don't want that because we want to show users the image we want to show users the comment

7
00:00:31.740 --> 00:00:40.040
the Post owner the Like button the like label and whatever we want in the past self.

8
00:00:40.170 --> 00:00:47.580
So let me open this pains from the left and right button and we have to go to mean that storyboard because

9
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:50.630
that's where we're going to do this operation.

10
00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:54.160
We don't even have a table view in our feed.

11
00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.100
We have controller right now.

12
00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.490
So first thing to do is should be opening our library and bringing in a table view.

13
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:06.960
So this is going to be a regular table view like we have been doing so far.

14
00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:07.730
OK.

15
00:01:07.860 --> 00:01:13.320
So bring in and in this view controller we will only have our table view.

16
00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:17.460
So I'm going to come over here and give zero constraints.

17
00:01:17.460 --> 00:01:18.190
OK.

18
00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:27.030
As usual so it will stretch out all the way to the edges and then we should find a way to create a new

19
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:36.180
cell in here and design that cell rather than creating this cell in the code in the feed we have controller

20
00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.380
table view.

21
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:45.670
Remember we had said that let's sell is a UI table you sell and sell the text labeled a tax on everything.

22
00:01:45.690 --> 00:01:47.730
Right now we don't want that.

23
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.740
So first let me open to the assistant editor and bring in this table view controller.

24
00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:53.110
OK.

25
00:01:53.130 --> 00:01:55.510
I'm going to call this table view.

26
00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:57.030
So this is working.

27
00:01:57.030 --> 00:01:58.510
That's good.

28
00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:07.320
And let me delete all of these comments from here and then we're good to go and do what we have to do

29
00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.450
to create a new cell.

30
00:02:09.450 --> 00:02:16.360
So if you come over to the attributes you will see this prototype so So does this default 0.

31
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:23.680
And if you make this one there is a cell appearing in here as you can see this is a table view so.

32
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:31.710
So let me drag this down a little bit to make this a little bit bigger because that's going to be our

33
00:02:31.710 --> 00:02:32.340
cell.

34
00:02:32.430 --> 00:02:36.380
That's the cell that we will be using in the table.

35
00:02:36.420 --> 00:02:39.840
So we can design it in the way that we want.

36
00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:40.460
Okay.

37
00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:45.720
That's what we use we use prototype cells to create new cells.

38
00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:52.530
I use them in our table view so that we can put anything we want in there.

39
00:02:52.590 --> 00:03:00.660
So rather than just showing a tax I'm going to go in and bring in some image views bringing some labels

40
00:03:00.660 --> 00:03:01.390
and everything.

41
00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.650
So let me drag this down a little bit and if you open your library you can drag in whatever you want.

42
00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:14.220
So please choose an image view and put it over here.

43
00:03:14.220 --> 00:03:19.980
So we will be displaying the pulsed image in the Image View for example.

44
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:22.390
So let me make this a little bit bigger.

45
00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:31.520
OK because we're building an Instagram clone and the image is the most important part above the image.

46
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:35.760
Maybe we can have a label displaying the user name or user email.

47
00:03:36.120 --> 00:03:36.990
OK.

48
00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:43.510
So let me make this one big and a little bit bigger here.

49
00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:44.710
So that's good.

50
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:45.600
OK.

51
00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:54.510
Let me in line this a little bit more and for label I'm just going to say user name or user email of

52
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:56.780
course we want to use it like this.

53
00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:05.450
But for right now I'm going to give it a name just to see how it looks like on my prototype so.

54
00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:12.590
So below my UI Image view I want to have another label in which I will show the comments.

55
00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.820
Right.

56
00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.980
So let me bring in a new label here.

57
00:04:16.980 --> 00:04:25.590
So this is where we're going to show the comments of course you may want to have a bigger label or maybe

58
00:04:25.590 --> 00:04:29.850
text fields in order to show a longer comments.

59
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:39.090
But in order to keep things simple I'm just going to call this comments and later on I'm going to add

60
00:04:39.630 --> 00:04:40.830
a new button.

61
00:04:40.830 --> 00:04:41.190
Right.

62
00:04:41.190 --> 00:04:45.090
So I have my user e-mail I have my image and comment.

63
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:47.700
Now I have to have a like button here as well.

64
00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.110
Remember our first app that we have seen in the first lecture of the section.

65
00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.060
We had that like button here right.

66
00:04:56.070 --> 00:05:04.410
So let me make this a little bit bigger and let goatee attributes we can call is like.

67
00:05:04.630 --> 00:05:12.550
So here let me put this a little bit left so that it will end line here.

68
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:13.250
Yep.

69
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.810
And we need labels to show the like count.

70
00:05:17.890 --> 00:05:18.250
OK.

71
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:26.200
This will only like the current past but we have to actually count the likes and we have to show them

72
00:05:26.230 --> 00:05:31.110
in a label in their right hand side on the bottom so.

73
00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:34.330
So let me bring in another label here.

74
00:05:34.330 --> 00:05:36.660
It's going to be our like count label.

75
00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:41.680
So let me make this a little bit bigger and align it to the right.

76
00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:45.760
So it will and line to the right edge of the image.

77
00:05:45.760 --> 00:05:50.830
OK so I'm gonna call the zero so we will understand.

78
00:05:50.890 --> 00:05:54.300
This is the like count and I believe that's it.

79
00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:58.280
That's what our prototype cell will look like.

80
00:05:58.330 --> 00:06:06.430
So this is our pulsed so if we don't like it we can always come back later and add any was delete existing

81
00:06:06.430 --> 00:06:08.810
ones and change the way it looks.

82
00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:16.270
If we want to and we have to give this an identifier but make sure that you select this table view self

83
00:06:16.630 --> 00:06:25.820
OK in the table view s I'm gonna call this cell and we will need this identifier so remember that we're

84
00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.260
creating a cell right here and we have to define it in the code as well.

85
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:38.380
And another new thing for you in order to drag and drop this into a view controller we're going to have

86
00:06:38.380 --> 00:06:43.750
to create a cocoa touch cause only for this table view cell.

87
00:06:43.810 --> 00:06:49.750
So yes we have a cocoa touch glass for table view cells as well.

88
00:06:49.750 --> 00:06:56.770
So if you come over here and say new file and select cocoa touch class we're not going to go for UI

89
00:06:57.010 --> 00:07:07.480
controller this time but we want UI table view s ok not table view controller UI table view so and you

90
00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:13.680
can change the name to feed Sal for example and after that.

91
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:17.330
Make sure Swift is selected on his next.

92
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:21.610
This will create a cocoa touch glass only for our feet.

93
00:07:21.610 --> 00:07:29.650
So we going to assign this to our feed cell and then drag and drop everything in here as you can see

94
00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:35.730
this is a UI table view cell rather than UI view controller right now.

95
00:07:35.770 --> 00:07:42.910
So go back to your main story board and we will start to drag and drop everything inside of our newly

96
00:07:42.910 --> 00:07:46.130
created cocoa touch class of course.

97
00:07:46.150 --> 00:07:50.920
Before that you have to select the cell OK.

98
00:07:51.190 --> 00:07:58.360
And make sure you go to identity inspector and in the class find the feed cell and they sign the feed

99
00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:05.810
cell to our cells so that this view and our view controller is connected together.

100
00:08:05.830 --> 00:08:10.780
So now we can start dragging and dropping everything inside of our feed cell.

101
00:08:10.810 --> 00:08:18.300
So let me click over here and let me find the views one by one and define it here.

102
00:08:18.300 --> 00:08:22.060
So let me drag here and say user e-mail.

103
00:08:22.060 --> 00:08:22.700
OK.

104
00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:24.810
User e-mail label.

105
00:08:24.910 --> 00:08:29.790
So this is going to be my label and let's go for comment labels.

106
00:08:29.790 --> 00:08:36.430
So this is comments label of course we we're going to have other labels an image view as well.

107
00:08:36.430 --> 00:08:39.000
So let's bring in the image view.

108
00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:44.760
So this is an eye user image view of our post image view whatever you want.

109
00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:45.280
OK.

110
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:53.850
User image view and so here we have a button or another button and like count labeled right.

111
00:08:53.900 --> 00:08:55.990
I'm going to take this zero.

112
00:08:56.110 --> 00:08:59.560
I'm gonna make sure I'm selecting the right things.

113
00:08:59.830 --> 00:09:04.420
Yes I want this one so I can just drag and drop from here as well.

114
00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:09.520
I'm going to call this like label because later on I'm going to go for like button.

115
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:16.510
So make sure button is selected and bring in as bring it in as an action so like button clicked.

116
00:09:16.510 --> 00:09:17.500
OK.

117
00:09:18.430 --> 00:09:22.750
So we are done for our feed cell I believe.

118
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.560
Now let's give some constraints.

119
00:09:25.570 --> 00:09:29.680
Let's say reset to suggest that constraints or update constraints.

120
00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:36.640
Make sure you give all these constraints to here and make sure you give width and height constraints

121
00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:42.640
to your UI image view as value in order to prevent anything from going wrong.

122
00:09:42.760 --> 00:09:43.060
OK.

123
00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:45.070
Like we used to do before.

124
00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.780
So this is our UI table view South cocoa to each class.

125
00:09:49.810 --> 00:09:50.480
OK.

126
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.080
As you can see we have this awake from naps.

127
00:09:53.110 --> 00:10:00.720
So this is kind of the load in the UI table view cell in regular controllers if you have we did load

128
00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:07.930
and in here I believe we have to make sure that table view is properly set up.

129
00:10:07.930 --> 00:10:13.690
So let me just run this for right now we're going to see an empty table view I believe.

130
00:10:14.230 --> 00:10:18.560
And then later on we're going to add the delegates and other stuff as well.

131
00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:21.730
So let me see the the empty table view.

132
00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:22.200
Yep.

133
00:10:22.210 --> 00:10:30.970
We see the empty table view right now I'm going to assign my cell as is my created cell by us.

134
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:35.770
So let me go over here as a UI table view delegates.

135
00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:37.260
OK.

136
00:10:37.300 --> 00:10:41.120
And UI table view data source.

137
00:10:41.220 --> 00:10:43.560
It's not auto completing again.

138
00:10:43.570 --> 00:10:49.120
So let me close this down and wait for it to come refresh.

139
00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.550
OK.

140
00:10:49.570 --> 00:10:56.110
So let's say table where you delegate self say will view data source self.

141
00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.800
Yeah it's not coming.

142
00:10:58.330 --> 00:11:02.640
And I believe we have to do command B to build this.

143
00:11:02.650 --> 00:11:02.890
Yeah.

144
00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:04.150
We're getting an error.

145
00:11:04.150 --> 00:11:07.690
So let me click on this I see what error do we have.

146
00:11:08.470 --> 00:11:08.700
Yeah.

147
00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:16.310
We're you're not getting an error actually because we haven't implemented the number of roads in S for

148
00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:24.030
oh I think the part that's why we're getting this error but it doesn't auto complete it for me.

149
00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:29.620
So I believe if you come across in a situation like this all you have to do is just close this down

150
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:32.380
okay and open it one more time.

151
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.030
So let's closes down and let's refresh this.

152
00:11:37.030 --> 00:11:42.300
Let's go to IRS and find the insta clone firebase.

153
00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:47.020
Make sure you select the workspace rather than work project.

154
00:11:47.050 --> 00:11:48.440
And here you go.

155
00:11:48.490 --> 00:11:52.330
Let's try to write and it doesn't show up really.

156
00:11:52.330 --> 00:11:58.390
So let me clean this and it says that it's indexing and after indexing completes.

157
00:11:58.390 --> 00:11:58.740
Yes.

158
00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:02.290
Now we can see all the auto completion.

159
00:12:02.290 --> 00:12:05.660
Now I can go for a number of rows in section.

160
00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.490
OK.

161
00:12:06.700 --> 00:12:13.720
And in here I'm just going to return 10 as an example later on we will change this and we need s for

162
00:12:13.860 --> 00:12:20.100
our index path and that's where we connect our newly created cell with our table view.

163
00:12:20.170 --> 00:12:20.890
Right.

164
00:12:20.890 --> 00:12:27.080
We generally say cell is UI table view cell but that's not what we want at this point.

165
00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:29.340
Rather we are going to say table view.

166
00:12:29.530 --> 00:12:37.390
OK we are referred to this table we have here and we are going to say that D Q reusable cell.

167
00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:45.490
So that's the way we want these two reusable salvage identifier and for index path that's how we connect

168
00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:53.410
our created prototype cell to does table view because we have that identify right and index that is

169
00:12:53.410 --> 00:13:02.260
indexed spot as given in the function as we how to cast is that speed cell and it will work because

170
00:13:02.260 --> 00:13:11.080
we have the feed cell we have controller file right and we have to return this cell because this function

171
00:13:11.110 --> 00:13:15.950
expects us to return a UI table we have so great.

172
00:13:15.970 --> 00:13:20.700
So let me do a command B and see if this area will go away.

173
00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:21.230
Yep.

174
00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:24.240
Everything seems to be working fine.

175
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:32.620
So let me show you how cool to work with the UI table view cells because if you say sounds out you can

176
00:13:32.620 --> 00:13:39.910
actually reach the comment label you can actually reach the like label D labels and image views that

177
00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:42.540
you have defined previously.

178
00:13:42.550 --> 00:13:46.120
Now I can't change those values from here.

179
00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:53.380
Now I can just say it's spelled out user email text is going to be something like test and you can just

180
00:13:53.380 --> 00:13:55.810
go for small dots like label.

181
00:13:55.810 --> 00:14:05.770
That tax is going to be zero for example and let's say Sal dot comment label dot tax is going to be

182
00:14:05.770 --> 00:14:06.990
a comment.

183
00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:07.680
OK.

184
00:14:07.690 --> 00:14:15.490
In fact let's do this something like user at email dot com to see how it looks like and let's say self

185
00:14:15.490 --> 00:14:24.610
doubt image view user image view not image view user image view that image is a UI image and open parentheses

186
00:14:24.910 --> 00:14:33.420
and find names and just give the select that PSG as a dummy variable in here because later on we're

187
00:14:33.430 --> 00:14:40.100
going to replace it with our post image and that's good for testing this.

188
00:14:40.100 --> 00:14:48.980
So let me create this and if this works out we will see 10 rows of our customized cell.

189
00:14:49.210 --> 00:14:49.640
OK.

190
00:14:50.510 --> 00:14:53.040
And if I run this.

191
00:14:53.050 --> 00:14:56.660
Yeah it gives me some kind of error I believe.

192
00:14:56.660 --> 00:14:56.880
Yeah.

193
00:14:56.900 --> 00:15:05.120
We have a crashing here and it doesn't see the table we've okayed says that table view is nil and it

194
00:15:05.120 --> 00:15:06.190
shouldn't be.

195
00:15:06.230 --> 00:15:12.630
And if you're coming across in a situation like this all you had to do is check the connections.

196
00:15:12.680 --> 00:15:15.310
So let me go to main story boards.

197
00:15:15.470 --> 00:15:18.890
OK and let me find our table for you.

198
00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.230
So let me click on this table view.

199
00:15:21.350 --> 00:15:28.250
Make sure you select the table view and if you go to those connections if you go to these outlets you

200
00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:33.680
will see that table view is not connected to our feed view controller.

201
00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:39.200
So let me open the feed we have controller even though we have done this before for a reason.

202
00:15:39.230 --> 00:15:41.840
I believe this is some kind of bug.

203
00:15:41.840 --> 00:15:47.030
So make sure you delete this and then we're going to define it again.

204
00:15:47.630 --> 00:15:52.940
So let me drag and drop table view and make sure you take the table view.

205
00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:53.730
OK.

206
00:15:53.810 --> 00:16:00.360
So I'm going to call this table you one more time and this time as you can see we now see the connection.

207
00:16:00.410 --> 00:16:04.240
It shouldn't happen really but I believe it's kind of a bug.

208
00:16:04.610 --> 00:16:09.630
So maybe you can come across in a situation like this later on in your project.

209
00:16:09.650 --> 00:16:12.460
So you know how to solve this.

210
00:16:12.590 --> 00:16:18.980
So let's try this one more time let's open our simulator and again if this works out we're going to

211
00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:24.190
see 10 rows filled with our customized so and.

212
00:16:24.350 --> 00:16:25.160
Here you go.

213
00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:28.110
Now we see our custom cells.

214
00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:30.960
Now we see the e-mail we see the image view.

215
00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:36.380
We see the comment label like bottom and like labeled 10 times.

216
00:16:36.380 --> 00:16:38.330
So that's great.

217
00:16:38.330 --> 00:16:45.530
Now all we have to do is find a way to get all of this information from file your store so that we can

218
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:48.360
display them one by one in here.

219
00:16:48.470 --> 00:16:54.900
And after getting this information displaying them is trivial because we already have this setup.

220
00:16:54.980 --> 00:17:00.650
All we want to do is just fill up the arrays and show them to the users.

221
00:17:00.650 --> 00:17:03.230
So that's what we're going to do within the next lecture.
