00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:01.480
Hi.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:08.100
Following this lecture we going to spend a couple of lectures in order to finish our user interface.

3
00:00:08.100 --> 00:00:13.290
We're going to have to add new wave controllers so that we will have a complete app.

4
00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:21.060
Right now we already have our places we have controller and sign up leave controller then a user taps

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:25.240
click button over here the ad button over here actually.

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:33.090
They will have to come over a new controller in which they will have to give out the specifications

7
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:36.230
of the place that is going to be created.

8
00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:42.510
For example like a name and type and not must fear an image.

9
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:48.720
And if you want anything else to save on the parser where you can add this as well.

10
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.900
And we going to have a map with a controller in which we will choose the coordinates.

11
00:00:54.970 --> 00:00:58.180
So let me bring in the new controller.

12
00:00:58.260 --> 00:01:01.350
We are going to add the new place here.

13
00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.260
We're going to start with getting the name of the place the type of the place.

14
00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:09.850
So we're going to need a lot of text fields right.

15
00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:11.860
So let me search for one.

16
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.900
So this one.

17
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:13.370
Yep.

18
00:01:13.380 --> 00:01:15.360
Bring in one text field.

19
00:01:15.370 --> 00:01:19.940
We can make this a little bit bigger so that it will look better.

20
00:01:20.200 --> 00:01:20.560
Yep.

21
00:01:20.590 --> 00:01:23.200
This one will be the place name.

22
00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:25.960
OK I will make this centrally aligned.

23
00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:29.860
Let me zoom in and here you go I believe that looks good.

24
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:35.530
So let me try to copy and paste this because we're going to need another one.

25
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:37.590
I'm going to call this place type.

26
00:01:37.690 --> 00:01:46.240
So this will be something like either this is a restaurant or a bar or a cafe and for the charged one

27
00:01:46.270 --> 00:01:50.770
I'm going to go for place Utmost Fear or description.

28
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:51.730
OK.

29
00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:58.640
So you can just try to choose your own parameters as well as something like an informative text.

30
00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:04.510
I'm going to go for a place atmosphere something like this is a fancy restaurant or this is a student

31
00:02:04.510 --> 00:02:07.190
cafe or this is fine dining.

32
00:02:07.490 --> 00:02:11.270
You're more than welcome to choose your own parameters.

33
00:02:11.290 --> 00:02:18.280
I'm going to go for a name type and place atmosphere so that we will have three options to save in to

34
00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:19.210
the past.

35
00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:27.670
And after that I'm going to need an image view to choose the image of that restaurant or or Death Cafe.

36
00:02:28.090 --> 00:02:37.090
OK so this is basic I'm going to come over here and choose the image view and we are then to do what

37
00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:38.650
we have been doing so far.

38
00:02:38.650 --> 00:02:46.900
I'm going to embed in an image here saying that tap to select a new picture and the users will have

39
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:55.140
to click on that to open the photo library and choose one of the images so that's easy to do.

40
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:02.830
And I'm going to bring in one button as well and I will name this by the next rather than upload our

41
00:03:02.830 --> 00:03:11.950
save because after that we're going to have to choose a location from the maps before we save this information.

42
00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:12.280
Right.

43
00:03:12.310 --> 00:03:14.580
So this will be our next bottom.

44
00:03:14.710 --> 00:03:21.930
Of course we can put this next button on the bar button items as well but right now I believe we have

45
00:03:21.940 --> 00:03:23.580
space in here.

46
00:03:23.650 --> 00:03:31.510
So I'm going to go for this one and say you reset to suggest it's constraints and I believe it designs

47
00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:33.370
reset to suggest such constraints.

48
00:03:33.370 --> 00:03:35.410
Let me do it one more time.

49
00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:36.060
Here you go.

50
00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:41.870
Now it's working and I'm going to give some fixed with the and height constraints to this.

51
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:51.820
We controller not we've controller to this UI Image view as about now I need an image to place a hold

52
00:03:51.820 --> 00:04:00.340
here as a way to indicate that the users will have to tap this huge view to select one picture.

53
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:07.990
Ok I'm gonna do this in sketch and if you don't want to do that you you're just you can just go to my

54
00:04:07.990 --> 00:04:12.750
github page and take my image from that github page.

55
00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:18.880
So as you can see we have two hundred eighty six to two we haven't heard over here so I'm going to give

56
00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:26.780
the exact same width and height to my image and I'm going to choose something blue or green.

57
00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:31.330
And again we will have a basic design section in this course as well.

58
00:04:31.330 --> 00:04:38.650
After watching that section you will be much more comfortable to do this kind of operation on photoshop

59
00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:41.410
or sketch or dub exceed.

60
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:42.650
OK.

61
00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:53.250
So I believe we have to go for white and call this tapped to select picture or tap to select image Yep.

62
00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:56.920
This is more than good for us right now.

63
00:04:56.960 --> 00:04:58.520
I'm going to export this.

64
00:04:58.520 --> 00:05:03.120
So let me grip this and say select image or select picture.

65
00:05:03.210 --> 00:05:04.200
OK.

66
00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.770
And let's say export does.

67
00:05:08.540 --> 00:05:15.950
And I'm going to Yep say Save and I'm going to delete this because I want to use it later on.

68
00:05:16.340 --> 00:05:21.400
So let me bring in this select image that PSG into my assets.

69
00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:22.580
So here you go.

70
00:05:22.580 --> 00:05:24.050
Now I'm done.

71
00:05:24.110 --> 00:05:31.600
So let's go back to main story boards and select that picture from these image properties.

72
00:05:31.610 --> 00:05:33.100
And here you go.

73
00:05:33.170 --> 00:05:40.160
Now it's OK now I believe we have to add that cocoa touch glass so that we can define everything in

74
00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:41.600
here to our class.

75
00:05:41.630 --> 00:05:44.590
So let me come over here and right click.

76
00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.830
Say new file choose cocoa touch class and instead of view controller I'm going to go for something like

77
00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:59.210
ad place VTC or at place we we controller because we are going to be adding places in this view controller

78
00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:06.080
you can't call does something like details or imagery controller something like choosing the options

79
00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.400
we have controller.

80
00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:13.850
I'm going to go for ad place VCR and I'm spending time in here because actually choosing the variable

81
00:06:13.850 --> 00:06:20.300
name and class names are important because in the real life examples you will be working with multiple

82
00:06:20.300 --> 00:06:22.070
developers in big projects.

83
00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:24.280
So you're going to have to come up with goods.

84
00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.880
We have controller names like Good's variable names.

85
00:06:28.070 --> 00:06:33.650
So please think about it before you just choose a random name.

86
00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:40.610
So come over here to me in storyboards and choose the weave controller and go to the identity Inspector

87
00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:44.850
very you can find the ad place we see and connect them together.

88
00:06:45.110 --> 00:06:46.190
So far so good.

89
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:50.760
So let's do the Segway from places we see to here and say show.

90
00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:59.630
And as you can see we get our back button and once we do that it's kind of distorted the whole constraints

91
00:06:59.630 --> 00:07:05.960
over here so let me put this down a little bit and say update constraint constants.

92
00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:09.650
And now I believe this is OK right.

93
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:18.230
So let me open then the assistant editor and go to that place V.C. and bring in all the wheels one by

94
00:07:18.230 --> 00:07:18.570
one.

95
00:07:18.590 --> 00:07:21.270
So let's delete this commented lice.

96
00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:25.310
Let's go to the name text.

97
00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:27.320
So this is place name text.

98
00:07:27.320 --> 00:07:34.430
OK so this is going to be place same place name text and place type text.

99
00:07:34.430 --> 00:07:39.020
So let me bring in this one place type text.

100
00:07:39.020 --> 00:07:44.910
And for the church one I'm going to go for place utmost fear text.

101
00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:53.360
So the atmosphere is kind of a wrong choice I believe because it's kind of long but we can deal with

102
00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:54.020
it.

103
00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:57.030
So let's go for place image view.

104
00:07:57.500 --> 00:08:01.450
And finally we have to go what does next action button.

105
00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.060
So next button clicks So here you go.

106
00:08:05.060 --> 00:08:12.340
We have created our ad place we have controller and we have created to Coco teach class related to that

107
00:08:12.350 --> 00:08:13.850
we have controller.

108
00:08:13.940 --> 00:08:22.010
Now we have to add a map we have controller so that after user clicks on next they will see a map in

109
00:08:22.010 --> 00:08:25.730
which they will choose the location of the place they want to add.

110
00:08:25.850 --> 00:08:29.100
And we will get the coordinates and upload them to the past.

111
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:30.040
So great.

112
00:08:30.050 --> 00:08:32.320
Let's do that in the next lecture.
