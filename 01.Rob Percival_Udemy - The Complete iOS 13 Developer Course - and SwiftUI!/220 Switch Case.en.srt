00:00:00,490 --> 00:00:06,080
Hi we didn't this lecture regrowing to learn about speech case control statements.

2
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:14,250
In fact this is not a very advanced topic but we haven't had the chance to see this at this point.

3
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,270
So we are going to see this so that you know how to work with speech cases.

4
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:26,460
This is kind of an evil state but this is kind of fun if check but it has a rather different syntax

5
00:00:26,460 --> 00:00:28,500
and rather different usage.

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:29,670
You're again to see what I mean.

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,270
So let me comment out this prince so we will have a good look.

8
00:00:34,270 --> 00:00:36,720
Cat over here and let me comment.

9
00:00:36,730 --> 00:00:38,280
Are these lines as well.

10
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:40,590
So we will have a clear look.

11
00:00:41,090 --> 00:00:48,870
OK so now I believe yeah we have to comment out some other lines as well like this.

12
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:52,350
So let me run this one more time.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:52,680
Yep.

14
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:55,390
Here we go we have a clear log.

15
00:00:55,500 --> 00:01:00,750
Now let me come over here and show you the switch case usage.

16
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:05,700
And in order to do that I'm going to show you the remainder sine text as well.

17
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:12,410
We haven't seen this before as well so that we will learn two subjects in this lecture.

18
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,980
For example I have an integer called my num and it's eleven.

19
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:26,450
So what if I want to know what we like get as a remainder if I divide eleven by two.

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,610
So if I divide eleven by two I will get the remainder of 1.

21
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:32,100
Right.

22
00:01:32,100 --> 00:01:36,730
If I divide it by tree I will get the remainder of two right.

23
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:38,250
Five divided by four.

24
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,000
I will get the remainder of three.

25
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,890
Yep you can do this easily on your mind but if it was a too large number then you would have the difficulty.

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:52,520
So let me show you how this goes with Swift.

27
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:53,820
So you're right.

28
00:01:53,820 --> 00:01:59,050
My NUM and have a percent sign over here like this.

29
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,030
OK.

30
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:03,390
And then say the number that you want to divide it.

31
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:05,460
That for example.

32
00:02:05,460 --> 00:02:11,310
Now let me print out this might remain the variable and you're getting a see it's going to print out

33
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:16,500
one because if I divide eleven by two it will be one.

34
00:02:16,620 --> 00:02:19,000
If I divide eleven by three.

35
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:21,420
The remainder will be two.

36
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:22,860
So it's working.

37
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,620
So if I divide my number by for her they remain there will be three.

38
00:02:29,010 --> 00:02:29,820
Yep.

39
00:02:29,850 --> 00:02:31,270
Now it's working.

40
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:36,840
Now suppose that I want to have an if check on this remainder.

41
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,890
So let me write this if my remainder is 1 then I'm just going to print out it's 1.

42
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:45,950
OK.

43
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:52,410
So it will be like this and as if my remainder is.

44
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,010
OK.

45
00:02:54,050 --> 00:03:00,560
Is 2 I'm going to print out it's two and then one more time.

46
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:08,070
Else if my remainder is three then I'm going to print out it's three.

47
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,610
So it goes like this.

48
00:03:09,610 --> 00:03:13,840
So you understand these structure right now.

49
00:03:13,860 --> 00:03:22,110
Now if I around this of course is going to print out it's three and it's working but we can do this

50
00:03:22,140 --> 00:03:24,330
easily with switch case as well.

51
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:27,230
So let me show you how to do that.

52
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:32,280
How to do the same thing with switch case control statements.

53
00:03:32,490 --> 00:03:38,390
So switch cases can be very helpful if you have a lot of else if statements.

54
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,820
So it goes like does you say switch.

55
00:03:41,880 --> 00:03:42,210
OK.

56
00:03:42,210 --> 00:03:48,840
You use the switch keyword and then you have to specify the variable that you're going to switch the

57
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:49,940
value.

58
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:52,990
So in our case it's my remainder.

59
00:03:53,010 --> 00:04:03,840
OK so I'm going to write switch and say My remainder OK and then I'm going to open a curly brace and

60
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:12,000
this will be my coding block but this time rather than saying if or else if or anything I'm going to

61
00:04:12,240 --> 00:04:15,150
bring in some case keyword.

62
00:04:15,150 --> 00:04:22,770
So this means that if the value of my remainder is one then what I'm going to do as you can see I'm

63
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:29,130
using a column this time rather than curly brace and it's the first time that we're seeing this but

64
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:31,990
it's the syntax for switch case.

65
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,120
So if you say Case 1 and hit enter you can't write what will happen if this is one.

66
00:04:38,760 --> 00:04:45,470
So I'm going to print out Case 1 it's 1 and in the case 2 I'm going to say it's 2 OK.

67
00:04:45,510 --> 00:04:54,510
And in case 3 I'm going to say print it's three and we have to provide a case default over here as well.

68
00:04:55,140 --> 00:05:02,450
So default means if this doesn't fall into any category that I have defined a bow.

69
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:04,580
Then this will have this value.

70
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:08,040
So this is kind of an else statement.

71
00:05:08,380 --> 00:05:10,960
And I will just called is none of the above.

72
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:20,060
So if I run this right now I will get the exact same result that I got in my if control statements.

73
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:27,060
OK so let me comment this out so that we can see the switch.

74
00:05:27,070 --> 00:05:28,990
So let me come over here.

75
00:05:29,050 --> 00:05:34,400
If I run this you will see it saying that it's tree.

76
00:05:34,570 --> 00:05:36,490
Now it's working.

77
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:46,270
And you know how to run switch cases and sometimes it's a lot easier to work with switch cases because

78
00:05:46,270 --> 00:05:48,250
you can do this as well.

79
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:51,120
So you can say that case one two three.

80
00:05:51,130 --> 00:06:00,450
And let me delete all of this and if the case is between 1 and 3 then it will print out one two three.

81
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:08,980
So if you have a lot of else is done just remember that you can use switch cases in order to write this

82
00:06:08,980 --> 00:06:10,450
more efficiently.

83
00:06:10,450 --> 00:06:19,000
And if you have a case like this where you can specify some range from 1 to 50 for example again switch

84
00:06:19,000 --> 00:06:22,120
cases will be very helpful for you.

85
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:26,770
Now let's stop here and within the next lecture we are going to see breakpoints.
