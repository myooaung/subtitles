00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.480
Hi.

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:08.430
We didn't lecture regrowing to learn how we can export the images that we have created in the adult

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:12.240
beads so that we can use them in the X code.

4
00:00:12.300 --> 00:00:20.820
So in fact let me do the select to tap to select image thing one more time because we actually need

5
00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:23.610
that thing in real life right.

6
00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.810
So let me come over here and give some color to our rectangle and I'm going to lose the borders because

7
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:33.150
we won't be using them.

8
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:44.040
And then let me bring in some text and I'm going to call this tap to select image okay like this like

9
00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.060
we have done before.

10
00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:53.430
So after that let's select the select tool and make this a little bit bigger so we can make the central.

11
00:00:53.580 --> 00:00:56.010
And we can see every text.

12
00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:06.240
Now once we do that actually we can round this rectangle up a little bit so if we choose this right

13
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:14.750
option over here you can give some values to rub this up for example rather than zero.

14
00:01:14.790 --> 00:01:20.870
You can come over here a can see changes the first coroner.

15
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:29.190
So rather than zero you can just say six over here and it will run this up so you can give the same

16
00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.760
amount.

17
00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.390
Same value to every corner.

18
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:38.280
So you can have a round of the rectangle and by rounded I mean smooth corners.

19
00:01:38.670 --> 00:01:45.960
Now if I choose these views together and I want to group them right so that I can export them.

20
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.270
So I want to right click on those views.

21
00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:56.190
You can just select group from this menu in order to create a group and then you can come over here

22
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:03.300
and you can just click on this double click on this to change the name of the group that you have created.

23
00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:04.480
OK.

24
00:02:04.590 --> 00:02:07.870
So I'm going to name the something like tapped select image.

25
00:02:07.920 --> 00:02:12.680
After that we get to make sure that we select this to export.

26
00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:18.060
So once we do that then we export some stuff out of this project.

27
00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.920
Only these selected items will be X port it's not the others.

28
00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:28.890
For example let me draw a circle over here since I'm not tagging this to be exported.

29
00:02:29.070 --> 00:02:31.730
And you will see that I export something.

30
00:02:31.740 --> 00:02:33.170
It won't be exported.

31
00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:36.540
So let me come over here to export batch.

32
00:02:36.670 --> 00:02:37.400
OK.

33
00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:45.900
Once you select that as you can see now we are saving this into some folder and even the name is select

34
00:02:46.090 --> 00:02:48.430
to image or K tapped select image.

35
00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:54.800
And we are not actually say exporting the circle that we have grown rather than cloud.

36
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.760
I'm going to save this to desktop and we generally go with PSG rather than J PAC.

37
00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:08.700
So if we have any transparent background the PSG shows is transparent the NJ PAC doesn't show it transparently

38
00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:10.530
choses invite.

39
00:03:10.650 --> 00:03:11.550
OK.

40
00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:19.080
So we generally use PND and rather than that or design I'm just going to go with IRS because we're working

41
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.810
with IRS OK.

42
00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:22.880
And it's asking me.

43
00:03:22.990 --> 00:03:29.670
It's actually indicating that it will create something called One X two extra X you will see what this

44
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.210
means.

45
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.060
So let me save this project as well.

46
00:03:34.170 --> 00:03:39.210
So I'm going to save this on my desktop here not in the cloud.

47
00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:46.220
So I'm going to come over here and say select and let me name the something like SELECT image.

48
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:52.050
OK so that we can see how exciting projects look like as well.

49
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.850
So here you go.

50
00:03:53.850 --> 00:03:59.640
Now we have the equity project and we have the images and we have three of them.

51
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.440
Why do we have three images.

52
00:04:01.440 --> 00:04:10.770
So let me open every each of them so that you can see for yourselves that we have the bigger sizes now

53
00:04:10.980 --> 00:04:19.350
one X means this base image the smallest image over here and 2 x means this bigger image in the middle

54
00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:21.690
and 3 X means the biggest image.

55
00:04:21.750 --> 00:04:23.640
Why do we have all those.

56
00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:28.620
Because we have different screen sizes in iPhones and nine parts.

57
00:04:28.620 --> 00:04:35.970
So X code will actually actually work and try to figure out which one to use when it's necessary.

58
00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:44.880
So if we're using a big screen iPad it will only use the 3 x 1 and if we're using an iPhone AC it will

59
00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.920
probably use this one x.

60
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:55.950
So if we don't do that it will be too much pixilated in the big screen sizes so it won't look good.

61
00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:56.790
OK.

62
00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:01.290
So let me create an X called Project and show you what I mean.

63
00:05:01.550 --> 00:05:08.810
So I'm going to just called is designed task because we're not going to do much over here we're just

64
00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:11.370
going to bring in those assets.

65
00:05:11.390 --> 00:05:16.550
So I'm going to create this under my regular I guess project folder.

66
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.200
I don't believe I need to upload this to get help later on anyway.

67
00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:28.400
But right now I'm just creating this and I suggest you do the same as well so that you can get a hold

68
00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:32.750
of what it feels like to work with the sets as you can see.

69
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.680
Now I can bring in the One X but now I can just bring in the 2 x and three X as well.

70
00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:47.180
And since I done that separately the didn't understand but I can just drag this down and I can just

71
00:05:47.180 --> 00:05:54.860
delete the other one the empty one and I can just go with that I can even change its name to whatever

72
00:05:54.890 --> 00:05:56.300
I want.

73
00:05:56.300 --> 00:06:05.410
So right now I have three versions of this image even though I'm only going to use one in the main storyboard.

74
00:06:05.420 --> 00:06:09.630
It's Will under sense which one to use when it's necessary.

75
00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.170
So let me bring in some image view for example and let me make this a little bit bigger.

76
00:06:16.270 --> 00:06:24.980
And if I come over here to image I can only see one because I only have one image anyway but I have

77
00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:28.460
different sizes different options for that image.

78
00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:36.290
So if I work with a big size it will use the three X if I work with a small size it will just use the

79
00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:43.780
one X and if you click one of those you can see the attributes you can see the properties as well.

80
00:06:43.790 --> 00:06:44.560
Okay.

81
00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:51.290
For example you can come over here if you really want to do some things specific to iPhones you can

82
00:06:51.290 --> 00:06:55.560
just choose it or you can just go for i pads as well.

83
00:06:55.580 --> 00:07:04.010
But if you're developing an app for iPhone and iPad at the same time you can just go for universal like

84
00:07:04.100 --> 00:07:11.780
it's the default option if you're working something for Apple TV I suggest you go just check this out

85
00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:20.660
and create some images exclusively for Apple TV as well but in our case most of the time we want to

86
00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:31.820
work with universal think okay and we have to supply the 1 x 2 x and x images over here so you can see

87
00:07:32.030 --> 00:07:38.490
the other properties over here like the size of the image the name of the image.

88
00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:42.650
And I believe that's it for the properties.

89
00:07:42.650 --> 00:07:49.670
Now you know how to expert images and how to bring them in and how to use them for different screen

90
00:07:49.670 --> 00:07:56.710
sizes and you know how to work with the Adobe 60 at least in an introductory manner.

91
00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:57.690
Okay.

92
00:07:57.770 --> 00:08:04.710
So you know the basics you know how to use the views you know how to use the operations and stuff.

93
00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:10.340
Now I believe it's time for us to stop here and within the next six year we're going to practice what

94
00:08:10.340 --> 00:08:12.190
we have learned so far.
