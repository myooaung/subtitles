00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:05.310
Hi within this lecture we're going to see how we can use plug ins.

2
00:00:05.430 --> 00:00:06.600
So in order to do that.

3
00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.510
Come over here to we've menu and choose plug ins from that menu so that you can see the plugins many

4
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:14.080
on the left hand side.

5
00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:23.010
In fact we have seen that before Rummy tried to go over the overview of the Adobe Eesti but we haven't

6
00:00:23.010 --> 00:00:24.930
seen what it really does.

7
00:00:24.930 --> 00:00:32.010
Now we're going to see it for example I have some plug ins over here but most probably you don't have

8
00:00:32.010 --> 00:00:39.830
one so you can just add the one by clicking on that button and searching for one over here.

9
00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:48.720
For example I'm going to show you a faces plug in so that you can create really good design by bringing

10
00:00:48.780 --> 00:00:51.150
in some people faces in your project.

11
00:00:51.150 --> 00:00:53.190
So let me show you how it goes.

12
00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:59.540
After you open this plugins ALL YOU HAVE TO DO IS JUST COME OVER HERE AND WRITE UI faces.

13
00:00:59.610 --> 00:01:03.650
OK so in here you will see the installed button.

14
00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:10.050
If you click over here it will just install the plugin and you can see it on the left on site.

15
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:17.100
So I'm going to create the new art board over here so that we can use our new plug in inside of our

16
00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:18.990
new artwork.

17
00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:26.790
So let me come over here and just click on the UI faces and it will present you some options.

18
00:01:26.790 --> 00:01:36.300
So here we choose what kind of options what kind of faces that we may want to bring in our project.

19
00:01:36.300 --> 00:01:40.210
For example in the first section you see the sources.

20
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:48.000
So this gets its faces this gets some people's faces from pixels pixels dot com so this pixels dot com

21
00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:54.120
actually provides some royalty free images so that you can use them freely in your apps.

22
00:01:54.150 --> 00:02:01.230
For example I am D.B. dot com random user dot to me so I'm just going to go for death as an example

23
00:02:01.830 --> 00:02:05.480
and you can actually choose the gender and age as well.

24
00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:12.720
So I'm going to go for 18 to 30 and for gender I'm going to go for male and emotion will be happy so

25
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:15.330
he can just choose a hair color.

26
00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:23.370
And here we have some advanced features as well for for example if you don't choose randomize it will

27
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:28.410
bring the most popular faces that heat that it can find.

28
00:02:28.470 --> 00:02:36.480
But if you choose it it will just be random and in the optimize it will try to fit the faces into your

29
00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:44.610
images or into your shapes or into your whatever you may want to try and bring in this faces if you

30
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:46.950
don't choose it it will just try to do its best.

31
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:47.690
OK.

32
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:55.680
So after you do that you can actually hit on the app light faces but it won't work because in order

33
00:02:55.680 --> 00:03:02.570
to make this work we have to create some shapes we have to create some views first.

34
00:03:02.670 --> 00:03:08.790
So I'm going to come over here and not over a year actually I'm just going to come over here and bring

35
00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:10.350
in a circle.

36
00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:11.080
OK.

37
00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:15.880
So this will be the shape that I'm then I will be filling in.

38
00:03:15.900 --> 00:03:23.130
So after you choose the shape you can they this faces and you will see it will feel the shape with some

39
00:03:23.130 --> 00:03:24.510
face.

40
00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.830
So that's good.

41
00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:32.820
But I don't want only one single face I'm going to repeat this grid and I'm just going to repeat this

42
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:33.570
like that.

43
00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:34.330
OK.

44
00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:38.160
But as you can see it won't change the picture.

45
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:42.300
So I want some different faces on different circles.

46
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:49.410
So what I'm going to do I'm just going to create a circle one more time and before filling this in I'm

47
00:03:49.410 --> 00:03:57.990
just going to repeat this grid or you can just do copy and paste as well by repeating this will be much

48
00:03:58.050 --> 00:03:58.680
easier.

49
00:03:58.830 --> 00:03:59.760
OK.

50
00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.740
And then you can actually adjust these space over here as well or you can try to move this a little

51
00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:15.420
bit to the left and you have to click on one of the circles but I don't I can't seem to click on any

52
00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:17.460
one of them yet like that.

53
00:04:17.550 --> 00:04:22.440
And after that of course you can just expand it vertically as well.

54
00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:23.000
OK.

55
00:04:23.010 --> 00:04:27.860
So let me come over here and try to repeat this grid.

56
00:04:27.990 --> 00:04:30.950
So let me do repeat grid one more time.

57
00:04:30.960 --> 00:04:31.220
Yes.

58
00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.280
This is working.

59
00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.270
And here you go.

60
00:04:34.290 --> 00:04:42.630
Now I have a lot of circles over here which is good so I can move this into a central way like that.

61
00:04:42.630 --> 00:04:49.950
And here you go I have a lot of circles in order to fill this up with faces you have to unwrap every

62
00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:51.520
so circle over here.

63
00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:55.740
OK the UI faces don't work on groups very well.

64
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:04.040
So now I have to choose everything from here and try to apply UI faces one more time.

65
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:05.520
And here you go.

66
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:09.510
We couldn't do it so I believe we still have some groups.

67
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:17.790
Let me just right click over here on say on groups so that we would have individual circles and then

68
00:05:17.790 --> 00:05:19.260
try one more time.

69
00:05:19.500 --> 00:05:19.890
OK.

70
00:05:19.890 --> 00:05:22.740
Now if I say apply faces here you go.

71
00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:29.220
Now it's feeling old in circles with different faces in the options that we have specified.

72
00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:30.110
OK.

73
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:31.530
With the options.

74
00:05:31.530 --> 00:05:42.420
So now I have some faces for male and female faces between the age of 18 to 30 and with the hair color

75
00:05:42.420 --> 00:05:46.500
of blonde and brown as exactly as I specified.

76
00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.840
So here you go.

77
00:05:47.910 --> 00:05:51.090
It's doing a great job now.

78
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:58.800
For example let me bring in some rectangle over here to use as a cover because we're going to use this

79
00:05:58.830 --> 00:06:02.330
as a splash screen for a dating app.

80
00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:03.000
OK.

81
00:06:03.180 --> 00:06:06.260
So I'm going to choose and blue color over here.

82
00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.600
OK.

83
00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:06.980
OK.

84
00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:12.590
Of course you can go with another design as well but I'm just going to do that.

85
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:19.740
I'm going to choose this and just give some transparency to dot so that we can see the faces but we

86
00:06:19.740 --> 00:06:22.680
would have a cover as well like that.

87
00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:23.450
Okay.

88
00:06:23.550 --> 00:06:30.050
And I'm just going to make this a little bit bigger so it will cover everything over here and on the

89
00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.280
top of everything.

90
00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:37.920
I'm just going to bring in a tax and for example you can bring in your logo or I can offer your app

91
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:38.820
over here.

92
00:06:38.820 --> 00:06:45.180
I'm just going to go for a dating app and of course I'm going to edit this a little bit so it would

93
00:06:45.510 --> 00:06:46.890
look much better.

94
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.970
Right now we can't see this text as you can see.

95
00:06:51.990 --> 00:06:57.200
We have to change the color of this tax and change the size of this tax.

96
00:06:57.270 --> 00:06:59.740
So let me come over here for example.

97
00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.020
Let me do 40 and I believe that's too much.

98
00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:08.190
So let me do something like Turkey for example.

99
00:07:08.190 --> 00:07:09.630
And yep that's good.

100
00:07:09.630 --> 00:07:14.520
So let me make this a little bit bigger so it would fit.

101
00:07:14.520 --> 00:07:17.420
So let me change the color here.

102
00:07:17.430 --> 00:07:19.560
So let me make this white.

103
00:07:19.900 --> 00:07:28.140
And yep I believe that's better but we have to make this bald in order to see this in a very clear Ray.

104
00:07:28.140 --> 00:07:34.580
So let me give some shadow and let me come over here to regular and make it bald.

105
00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:35.430
And here you go.

106
00:07:35.430 --> 00:07:36.770
Now we can see it.

107
00:07:37.230 --> 00:07:43.340
And in fact we can try with other phones as well like dad are like that.

108
00:07:43.470 --> 00:07:44.700
So it looks good.

109
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:46.690
Of course it can be much better.

110
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:54.410
But the main point is that we have use the plug in in a very easy way and we managed to create a splice

111
00:07:54.410 --> 00:08:00.570
screen or and I welcome welcome screen in less than one or two minutes.

112
00:08:00.570 --> 00:08:00.990
OK.

113
00:08:01.410 --> 00:08:05.250
So it's very easy to use this plug ins.

114
00:08:05.250 --> 00:08:09.040
And it's actually very good looking.

115
00:08:09.090 --> 00:08:14.790
So we're going to stop here and we're going to see other examples of plug ins in the next lecture.
