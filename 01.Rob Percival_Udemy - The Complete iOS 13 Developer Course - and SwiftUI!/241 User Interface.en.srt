1
00:00:00,720 --> 00:00:01,500
Hi.

2
00:00:01,570 --> 00:00:07,530
We didn't lecture re going to go ahead and start working on our user interface.

3
00:00:07,530 --> 00:00:15,000
Well I'm going to do I'm going to try and finish our user interface at least most of them so that we

4
00:00:15,090 --> 00:00:18,120
won't focus on user interface anymore.

5
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:22,770
From that point on every going to focus on coding.

6
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:28,260
So in the first week controller re going to have design in capability.

7
00:00:28,260 --> 00:00:28,620
Right.

8
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:33,330
So I'm going to come over here and say refactor and rename.

9
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:41,190
I'm going to rename this week controller to be signed in V.C. once we refactoring rename this.

10
00:00:41,220 --> 00:00:47,010
It just changes all the names related to view controller in anywhere in the project.

11
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:53,940
Okay so I'm going to say sign in we see and I'm going to rename this and now that's OK.

12
00:00:54,130 --> 00:01:02,070
So let me come back to my main board and see if you're connected over here from identity inspector as

13
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:06,840
you can see class name here is changed as well.

14
00:01:06,870 --> 00:01:11,530
Now let me bring in what I need what I need is text fields right.

15
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:19,710
Because we're going to ask for input from the user like user name like user email and password.

16
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:28,790
So let me bring in one and then let me open the attributes inspector and say a name or e-mail over here.

17
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:35,880
First we have to ask for e-mail because it's really necessary to create an account and then we are going

18
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:37,630
to ask for a user name.

19
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,990
OK.

20
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,450
And then for lust one we can ask for password.

21
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:49,290
So let me zoom in a little bit so or here I'm going to ask for a password.

22
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:52,730
And of course we're going to need two buttons.

23
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:55,270
First of which is sign in.

24
00:01:55,290 --> 00:01:56,070
OK.

25
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,480
So let me make this a little bit bigger.

26
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:02,610
And this will sign the users in if they have a count.

27
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:10,310
So let me copy and paste it and bring in another button and this will be a sign up button.

28
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:16,740
So if they don't have an account they will register from here and let me choose everything from here

29
00:02:16,740 --> 00:02:25,530
and bring down a little bit so that I can have a label over here and I'm going to call this label Snapchat

30
00:02:25,560 --> 00:02:28,510
clone so that we can have a title.

31
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:32,420
So let's me come over here and say Snapchat clone.

32
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:35,890
So that's it's Snapchat chrome.

33
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:39,030
So let me increase the font size a little bit.

34
00:02:39,030 --> 00:02:40,760
So it will look better.

35
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:41,380
Here you go.

36
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:43,110
Now I believe we are ready.

37
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:52,220
So let me give the constraints and then later on we can bring all of these views inside of our signing

38
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:53,350
we see.

39
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,340
So let me come over here and bring in the e-mail text.

40
00:02:57,420 --> 00:03:00,110
OK so say e-mail texts.

41
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:00,570
Yes.

42
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:02,700
It doesn't seem to be working.

43
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,990
And if you get any error like this it should be a bug.

44
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:12,440
I believe it's because we have changed the name of designing easy.

45
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,460
So let me do a product clean and try one more time.

46
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,090
So let me come over here and say e-mail text.

47
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:21,420
Yep it doesn't work.

48
00:03:21,450 --> 00:03:28,260
So let me closes down Kay and open it one more time so it will resolve the issue.

49
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,860
So if you ever come across in a situation like this.

50
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:40,380
So you're certain that you assigned the class in the identity inspector but it still doesn't work.

51
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:43,040
Just close it down and open it one more time.

52
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,530
You will see it index sync over here OK.

53
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,180
It means that it's indexing the files it's synchronizing the files.

54
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:56,810
So after the indexing completes you will be able to bring in the viewers one more time.

55
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:04,050
So I'm going to wait until it's done and then try the e-mail text over here.

56
00:04:04,050 --> 00:04:05,410
So e-mail texts.

57
00:04:05,430 --> 00:04:05,750
Yep.

58
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:06,870
Now it's working.

59
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:10,130
So let me bring in the other views as well.

60
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:12,510
Like this user name text.

61
00:04:12,510 --> 00:04:15,610
So this is going to be user name text.

62
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:20,990
And then finally I'm going to need my third one the password text.

63
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,380
So this is password text.

64
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,550
And then we're going to have two actions.

65
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:33,300
First of which is sign in clicked OK and then sign up clicked.

66
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:39,150
So let me bring in this as well and say sign up clicked.

67
00:04:39,150 --> 00:04:40,230
So here you go.

68
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:44,570
Now we have the buttons we have the text fields as well.

69
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:51,390
So we are done over here so let me bring in a tab bar controller because remember we had the tab bar

70
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:53,280
in our prototype as well.

71
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,350
So let me bring in the tab bar.

72
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:01,180
So this is going to be our tab bar and we need another run.

73
00:05:01,180 --> 00:05:06,440
But for right now I'm just going to do a Segway from here to here.

74
00:05:06,490 --> 00:05:14,700
If you choose present model Lee and if you come here and choose the identity Inspector you can go for

75
00:05:14,710 --> 00:05:18,280
full screen and then it will be OK.

76
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:25,090
So over here let me give you an identifier as well so this will be to feed we see.

77
00:05:25,090 --> 00:05:28,630
So I'm going to call this feed we have controller one more time.

78
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,580
So rather than saying item 1 I'm going to say feat and for image.

79
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:38,290
Yep I believe we have new images over here so that's good.

80
00:05:38,290 --> 00:05:44,560
But I'm going to go for the old one like the F widths circular image.

81
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:48,040
OK so let me look for it a little bit.

82
00:05:48,040 --> 00:05:54,630
If we can't find it we can just choose a random image right now because we are just doing a test.

83
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:54,930
Yep.

84
00:05:54,940 --> 00:05:56,560
This one this looks good.

85
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:01,390
So f circle field so I'm going to do the same thing for upload as well.

86
00:06:01,690 --> 00:06:05,170
So this is where we're going to upload our pictures.

87
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:11,920
And let me find the new letter with feel circle feel.

88
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:14,710
So let me find it over here.

89
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:15,010
Yep.

90
00:06:15,040 --> 00:06:17,830
This one use circle field.

91
00:06:17,890 --> 00:06:19,800
So now it looks good I believe.

92
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:20,950
Feed and upload.

93
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,170
So what we gonna do we going to bring in the coco touch classes.

94
00:06:26,230 --> 00:06:26,560
Right.

95
00:06:26,560 --> 00:06:30,760
Because we need Coco touch classes for item one and item two.

96
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:38,410
So say new file and choose Coco touch class and make sure its UI we have controller and say feed we

97
00:06:38,410 --> 00:06:39,780
see once.

98
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:46,120
Once you do that you can hit next and save it under your current project folder.

99
00:06:46,120 --> 00:06:52,020
Now let me bring this up so that I'm their main story board.

100
00:06:52,030 --> 00:06:57,760
We can choose it but I'm going to go ahead and create the other ones as well.

101
00:06:57,850 --> 00:07:01,380
So this will be upload V.S. OK.

102
00:07:01,510 --> 00:07:04,860
And finally we're going to need another one.

103
00:07:04,870 --> 00:07:06,460
So let me do that as well.

104
00:07:06,460 --> 00:07:08,000
Before we continue.

105
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,150
So I'm going to say new file and new crocodile cottage class.

106
00:07:12,170 --> 00:07:16,840
I'm going to call the settings wi controller OK.

107
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:18,580
So here you go.

108
00:07:18,580 --> 00:07:25,990
Now we have our we have controllers of course we going to need another one later on but I believe that's

109
00:07:25,990 --> 00:07:27,940
OK for right now.

110
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:34,420
And since we have so much I'm going to create some groups over here because we're going to have a lot

111
00:07:34,420 --> 00:07:36,840
of file in this project.

112
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:40,620
So my group will have the name of we have controllers.

113
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:48,360
So I'm going to choose area we have controller I have and I'm going to bring it under my weave controllers.

114
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:50,490
So let me make sure this is closed.

115
00:07:50,860 --> 00:07:56,860
And if I bring them over it will just put them under we have controllers folder.

116
00:07:56,860 --> 00:08:01,270
So now it looks a little bit better I believe.

117
00:08:01,750 --> 00:08:04,750
So we can do that for delegates as well.

118
00:08:04,750 --> 00:08:05,050
Right.

119
00:08:05,050 --> 00:08:07,380
So we have this app delegate unseen delegate.

120
00:08:07,390 --> 00:08:11,820
So let me create a new group and call these delegates.

121
00:08:12,010 --> 00:08:18,340
So I'm going to bring in those two inside of my delegates folder.

122
00:08:18,490 --> 00:08:20,860
So now I have a neater look.

123
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,510
So let me come over my main story board and find feed.

124
00:08:25,510 --> 00:08:26,480
We have controller.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:27,150
OK.

126
00:08:27,290 --> 00:08:33,230
So I'm going to choose feed ABC from the identity inspector over here.

127
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:35,500
I'm going to do the same thing for upload.

128
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:37,900
We have controller as well.

129
00:08:37,900 --> 00:08:40,510
So now I have my upload.

130
00:08:40,510 --> 00:08:43,720
We have controller I have my feed we controller.

131
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:46,110
So let me bring in a new controller.

132
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:47,330
OK.

133
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:49,810
And this will be our settings.

134
00:08:49,870 --> 00:08:51,140
We have controller.

135
00:08:51,570 --> 00:08:55,670
So in the settings view controller we going to only have one button.

136
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,210
But anyway we're going to have the Segway.

137
00:08:59,290 --> 00:08:59,750
OK.

138
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:06,010
And this will be a relationship Segway because we're doing it from the tap bar.

139
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,590
And this will be cold.

140
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:12,130
This will have the class of settings we see.

141
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,510
So let me choose it.

142
00:09:14,710 --> 00:09:16,150
OK settings we see.

143
00:09:16,270 --> 00:09:16,590
Yep.

144
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:17,320
That's good.

145
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:22,300
So let me come over here and say settings.

146
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:23,600
Ants.

147
00:09:23,620 --> 00:09:25,690
Yep display settings.

148
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:34,270
And for image we're going to have to find the circular s again so that it will be consistent with each

149
00:09:34,270 --> 00:09:36,080
other.

150
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:38,200
So I cannot seem to find it.

151
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:41,650
So let me try to see is this it.

152
00:09:41,650 --> 00:09:43,900
So let me just choose it.

153
00:09:44,420 --> 00:09:44,800
Yep.

154
00:09:44,810 --> 00:09:53,280
This is an s but I believe it's not circular it's kind of square but in the others we have circular.

155
00:09:53,620 --> 00:10:00,350
Even though it doesn't better I'm just going to find the circular one as well so that they will be existent

156
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:02,070
with each other.

157
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:03,190
So here you go.

158
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:10,390
Now we can't see it so we have real nice icons we have real nice tap bar.

159
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:14,330
So let me bring in the settings bottom over here.

160
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:19,330
OK so let me place it in the middle of our reel controller.

161
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:31,320
Let me make this a little bit bigger and I'm going to call this settings and let me give you the constraints

162
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:31,830
as well.

163
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:38,460
So say reset to suggest its constraints and let me try to open the assistant editor with settings you

164
00:10:38,520 --> 00:10:42,250
controller and let me bring in this.

165
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,050
And by the way this should be logout or other down settings.

166
00:10:46,080 --> 00:10:46,800
Yep.

167
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:51,530
So let me bring in the logout and say logout clicked.

168
00:10:51,570 --> 00:10:55,780
So once I do that yeah I still got this error.

169
00:10:55,890 --> 00:11:01,200
So I believe there is something wrong with the project but I'm going to close it down and I'm going

170
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,080
to open it anyway to let it index.

171
00:11:04,080 --> 00:11:09,290
So it should be automatic but sometimes it gets stuck like this.

172
00:11:09,330 --> 00:11:13,460
So I believe we're good to go after this index is itself.

173
00:11:14,010 --> 00:11:21,890
So once it's once its index is I believe it would be better for us because it would work on feed ABC

174
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:23,370
and upload V.C. as well.

175
00:11:24,060 --> 00:11:26,820
So let me say logout clicked and here you go.

176
00:11:26,820 --> 00:11:28,380
Now it works.

177
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:36,390
So we're done with settings and in the upload we're going to have only one image and also an upload

178
00:11:36,390 --> 00:11:36,810
button.

179
00:11:36,810 --> 00:11:39,080
So this is very easy.

180
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:44,150
So let me bring in one image of you ok like this.

181
00:11:44,150 --> 00:11:51,480
So let me bring in and we can make this ad a little bit bigger than usual I believe because we're only

182
00:11:51,480 --> 00:11:58,710
going to have this one really so after that we're just going to bring in some real small button so it

183
00:11:58,710 --> 00:12:00,020
can be big.

184
00:12:00,030 --> 00:12:04,170
No this won't create any problems.

185
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:09,950
So let me bring in a button and this will be our upload button.

186
00:12:10,110 --> 00:12:12,590
So let me call this upload.

187
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:13,970
And here you go.

188
00:12:13,980 --> 00:12:18,140
Now let me just reset to suggest constraints.

189
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:25,300
And I'm going to give fixed width and height in order to prevent any distortions over here right now.

190
00:12:25,320 --> 00:12:32,210
Once I do that it gives me some errors regarding constraints I'm going to say update constraint constants.

191
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:34,310
And now it's OK.

192
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,230
Now we can bring in these views inside of our upload view controller as well.

193
00:12:40,650 --> 00:12:41,990
So let me choose this.

194
00:12:42,570 --> 00:12:44,970
And let's see if this works.

195
00:12:45,090 --> 00:12:48,180
So I'm going to call this upload image view.

196
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:49,520
OK.

197
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,630
And here you go.

198
00:12:50,640 --> 00:12:52,160
Now it works.

199
00:12:52,170 --> 00:12:55,890
So bring in the upload button as well.

200
00:12:55,890 --> 00:13:01,190
So let me delete everything from here and say upload clicked.

201
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:02,430
So here you go.

202
00:13:02,430 --> 00:13:04,140
Now we are done with upload.

203
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:04,980
We see.

204
00:13:04,980 --> 00:13:08,010
Let's move on to our feed we have controller.

205
00:13:08,090 --> 00:13:10,890
We are going to have a table over here.

206
00:13:11,250 --> 00:13:17,610
OK so let me bring in the table view and I'm going to say 0 0 0 2.

207
00:13:17,610 --> 00:13:23,580
All constraints to stretch it out because we are only going to have table we are inside of our we have

208
00:13:23,580 --> 00:13:24,780
controller.

209
00:13:24,810 --> 00:13:30,180
So let me bring this in INSIDE OF we've controller feed we have controller.

210
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:34,150
OK this is going to be our table view.

211
00:13:34,260 --> 00:13:36,150
So here you go.

212
00:13:36,180 --> 00:13:42,350
Now of course later on I'm going to create a new prototype cell in the feed we have controller.

213
00:13:42,350 --> 00:13:45,610
But right now we can just skip it and do it later on.

214
00:13:45,930 --> 00:13:48,480
So let me bring in another controller.

215
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:56,130
Remember when a user taps on one of these snaps it pops open another controller and displays an inside

216
00:13:56,130 --> 00:13:58,080
of an image slider.

217
00:13:58,080 --> 00:14:02,420
So we'll need another wi controller to display the snaps.

218
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:03,700
OK.

219
00:14:03,840 --> 00:14:11,210
And I'm going to call this snappy controller so after you click over we have controllers folder.

220
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:16,280
You can go ahead and create the Coco touch class for SNAP we see.

221
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:24,660
OK so make sure this is UI we have controller and create this under your weave controllers.

222
00:14:24,660 --> 00:14:34,140
So now I can come over here and I can click over here and choose snap we see from these lists.

223
00:14:34,140 --> 00:14:35,740
So here you go snap.

224
00:14:35,790 --> 00:14:39,330
We see now it says signed as snap we see.

225
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:45,360
So I'm going to do a Segway from here to here and this will be a show Segway.

226
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,420
It displays as a pop or we're about.

227
00:14:47,790 --> 00:14:48,940
I believe that's OK.

228
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:50,370
In our case.

229
00:14:50,370 --> 00:14:55,950
So again this will have an identifier and the identifier will be to snap.

230
00:14:55,950 --> 00:14:57,530
We have controller.

231
00:14:57,630 --> 00:14:58,370
OK.

232
00:14:58,410 --> 00:15:07,060
And in the snap controller we're only going to have a timed label and a big image slider right.

233
00:15:07,130 --> 00:15:11,950
And for image slider we're not going to use an old UI image view.

234
00:15:11,950 --> 00:15:15,370
I'd rather re going to bring in another library later on.

235
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:22,040
Right now I'm just going to create our label in which we will display the time left.

236
00:15:22,310 --> 00:15:27,470
OK so let me say something like time left over here.

237
00:15:28,070 --> 00:15:31,730
So this will display the time left to deletion.

238
00:15:31,820 --> 00:15:38,690
So this will be time left and make it centrally aligned and make does a little bigger so that we can

239
00:15:38,780 --> 00:15:40,600
put it over here.

240
00:15:40,760 --> 00:15:42,100
And here you go.

241
00:15:42,140 --> 00:15:51,710
Now we can just bring this in inside of this snap we've controller and let's control drag and say Time

242
00:15:52,030 --> 00:15:52,920
label.

243
00:15:52,950 --> 00:15:56,270
OK so that's it.

244
00:15:56,390 --> 00:15:57,980
So let's close this down.

245
00:15:58,130 --> 00:16:06,020
And let's not forget to use some suggested constraints over here and we are done with user interface.

246
00:16:06,080 --> 00:16:12,250
Of course we need some more tweaks over here but we're done for most of it.

247
00:16:12,920 --> 00:16:16,330
And now it is time to focus on coding.

248
00:16:16,610 --> 00:16:22,790
So let's stop here and within the next lecture we are going to create users and sign them in.
