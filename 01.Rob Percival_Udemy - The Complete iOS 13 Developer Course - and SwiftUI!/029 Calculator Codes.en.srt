00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,090
Hi.

2
00:00:01,220 --> 00:00:07,350
We didn't this lecture we going to define the views into a real controller and then we're going to work

3
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:07,980
on them.

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:16,170
So let me add a new editor over here and you can click on this view controller to bring you controller

5
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:24,270
on the right hand side or remember you can choose the view controller that Swift from here as well.

6
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:26,550
So this is the same thing.

7
00:00:26,690 --> 00:00:30,120
And in the left hand side we already see the main storyboard.

8
00:00:30,150 --> 00:00:35,040
So all we have to do is click drag and drop the view.

9
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:43,420
So remember you have to press control in your keyboard and then drag and drop inside of the class.

10
00:00:43,470 --> 00:00:52,230
But outside of this function so inside of this class I'm going to call this first number or first text

11
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:52,830
number.

12
00:00:52,840 --> 00:00:55,720
OK I'm going to call his first text.

13
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:59,370
I believe this is the simplest thing that I can call.

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:08,330
So does his first text let me add some couple of more lines and I'm going to bring in the second text.

15
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:20,360
So does a second text OK so let's say connects and then I believe we have to bring our label and then

16
00:01:20,760 --> 00:01:22,320
our buttons as well.

17
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,220
Remember if you made a mistake you can break the connections over here and delete everything a redefine

18
00:01:29,880 --> 00:01:34,250
but if not just don't go with it.

19
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,350
So I'm going to need some more actions to connect to over here.

20
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,810
But first I'm going to get my result label.

21
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:47,950
So let me bring this over here on call this result label.

22
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:48,740
OK.

23
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:52,150
So we're done with the tax feels in labels.

24
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,870
Now let's go for actions.

25
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:59,250
So first will be my adding summation function.

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:08,820
So let me try to take this and bring this over here and this is going to be an action and let's call

27
00:02:08,820 --> 00:02:11,930
this something like some action or some button clicked.

28
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:12,400
OK.

29
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,070
Let's call it some clicked on connect to our view controller.

30
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:19,640
So we have our first action.

31
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:25,530
Let's let's go for others so the second one will be deduction.

32
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:28,120
So I'm going to call this minus clicked.

33
00:02:28,650 --> 00:02:34,710
I'm not being coexistence or here one is some clicked and the second one is minus clicked.

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,680
Maybe I could have called a deduction clicked or clicked or something but it doesn't matter.

35
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,670
So third one will be multiplied clicked.

36
00:02:44,780 --> 00:02:45,280
OK.

37
00:02:46,230 --> 00:02:50,280
And we are here for the last one.

38
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:51,090
OK.

39
00:02:51,300 --> 00:02:57,000
So let's go for the last one and drag and drop to our view controller.

40
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,200
So I'm going to call this device clicked.

41
00:03:00,600 --> 00:03:05,120
So let's call the lights clicked and on connect.

42
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:06,000
So here we go.

43
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,570
We have defined everything in our view controller.

44
00:03:10,590 --> 00:03:13,950
So we are now ready to go and write our code.

45
00:03:13,950 --> 00:03:21,600
So let me close this down and let me choose view controller and the run does on my simulator to actually

46
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:28,460
see how it looks like on a real phone or a real simulator screen.

47
00:03:28,770 --> 00:03:30,140
OK.

48
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:38,100
It's wise to do that at this point because if you see any problem without going to all of the changes

49
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:45,000
in the coding section you may want to adjust the views a little bit and then continue writing your code.

50
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:56,190
So let me bring this simulator up and see if we can get the results over here and maybe we can just

51
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:04,080
take a look at the simulator settings as well because we have seen how to run the simulator but we haven't

52
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:13,020
seen the settings of the simulator here as well because they simulators have their own settings and

53
00:04:13,020 --> 00:04:16,080
then you click on the simulator you can reach their menu.

54
00:04:16,310 --> 00:04:17,140
OK.

55
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:26,280
So these are two different kind of softwares and they have their own menus so you can access them from

56
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:27,180
here.

57
00:04:27,180 --> 00:04:34,230
So we see our app we click on first number for example and we can try to write something.

58
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:35,080
Yeah it will.

59
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:35,490
Right.

60
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:38,710
So everything seems to be in order.

61
00:04:38,730 --> 00:04:45,540
And let me show you what I mean by settings if you go to debug section over here for example you can

62
00:04:45,540 --> 00:04:52,740
see some location or if you go to hardware you can see the keyboard so maybe you can just say toggle

63
00:04:52,740 --> 00:04:57,110
software keyboard and it will pop up the keyboards for you.

64
00:04:57,290 --> 00:04:57,720
OK.

65
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,030
So you can type it from here as well.

66
00:05:01,150 --> 00:05:07,060
Generally developers don't like to use it that way so they can't type it from their own keyboard.

67
00:05:07,180 --> 00:05:14,470
But you can change the settings from this keyboard menu as well so you can do whatever you want with

68
00:05:14,470 --> 00:05:19,380
the simulator you can change its location you can change its name.

69
00:05:19,510 --> 00:05:25,900
So these is great tool and as you can see nothing happens as I click on these buttons because I haven't

70
00:05:25,900 --> 00:05:32,410
written them yet so let's stop this and go to we've control that swift in which very we're going to

71
00:05:32,410 --> 00:05:34,090
write our codes.

72
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:37,160
So we're going to start with some collect.

73
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:43,870
We're going to test the first function and if that works we're going to reapply the same techniques

74
00:05:43,870 --> 00:05:45,490
to other functions as well.

75
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:48,770
So what do I want to do in the some clicks.

76
00:05:48,820 --> 00:05:54,940
First I want to get the first number right and then I want to get the second number and I wanted to

77
00:05:54,940 --> 00:06:01,030
display the results of their summation together in the result label.

78
00:06:01,060 --> 00:06:03,460
So let me create first number variable.

79
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,850
So the first number will be first text.

80
00:06:06,850 --> 00:06:07,180
Right.

81
00:06:07,180 --> 00:06:09,550
So this will be the place.

82
00:06:09,550 --> 00:06:13,420
This will be the view that our user is going to be writing.

83
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,580
They were inputs.

84
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,470
So I'm going to say first text dot text.

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:26,480
So if you just look at the attributes and methods over here you will see something like text.

86
00:06:26,530 --> 00:06:29,860
So this is the text display by the text field.

87
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:39,480
So whatever has our user written in this text field we can get it by saying first text not texts.

88
00:06:39,550 --> 00:06:41,050
So this is cool.

89
00:06:41,050 --> 00:06:49,050
We already got what is written the inside of the first text but this is going to be in strings.

90
00:06:49,060 --> 00:06:51,500
It's not going to be any teacher.

91
00:06:51,550 --> 00:07:01,840
OK so we just got this first text out text and it doesn't make sense to add this string to another we

92
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:08,950
have to convert this to into an integer or a double in order to make the same thing with the second

93
00:07:08,950 --> 00:07:09,690
text.

94
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:18,430
And they sum it up together so wrapped this around an integer and this will convert this text into any

95
00:07:18,430 --> 00:07:19,720
integer.

96
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:21,190
What is the problem here.

97
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:30,400
So we have to force casters or rehab to provide a double question marquee night in order to make this

98
00:07:30,460 --> 00:07:35,770
optional and provide the default value as you might remember.

99
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,230
So I'm going to force a wrap this first.

100
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,620
I will try and see if that works with force some wrapping is that fur.

101
00:07:45,760 --> 00:07:46,360
Very good.

102
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:48,380
If that doesn't I will change it.

103
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:49,250
OK.

104
00:07:49,420 --> 00:07:52,380
I'm going to do the same thing for a second number as well.

105
00:07:52,390 --> 00:08:00,850
So I'm going to say let's second number is going to be the integer of second text text OK.

106
00:08:01,330 --> 00:08:05,060
Second text that texts.

107
00:08:06,340 --> 00:08:07,510
So that's OK.

108
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:14,630
And we're going to sum this two together and we still haven't done yet.

109
00:08:14,650 --> 00:08:21,310
So we have to force our read this one more time I'm going to show you why I'm going to create a not

110
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,560
their value over here.

111
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:25,670
I'm going to call these results.

112
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:28,090
This is going to be the integer.

113
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,000
This is going to be first number plus second number.

114
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:31,330
Right.

115
00:08:31,330 --> 00:08:37,060
So this is first number but we see this as integer optional.

116
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:38,740
So this isn't good.

117
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:43,040
So second number is integer optional as well.

118
00:08:43,060 --> 00:08:43,840
And guess what.

119
00:08:43,840 --> 00:08:51,880
We cannot do that because these binary operator of summation binary operator of something these two

120
00:08:51,880 --> 00:08:57,640
numbers together cannot be applied to integer options.

121
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:07,630
So we have force I wrapped this why it is an optional because right now the first exclamation point

122
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:16,830
only stands for First tax that tax is going to be a taxed we are certain of that and if we put in not

123
00:09:16,840 --> 00:09:26,060
there exclamation point over here it means that this is definitely going to be an integer.

124
00:09:26,200 --> 00:09:33,970
So as you can see now this doesn't give me any error because the first number is not an integer optional

125
00:09:34,120 --> 00:09:35,770
anymore.

126
00:09:35,770 --> 00:09:38,910
So let me tell you one more time.

127
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:47,290
The first exclamation point means that this first Tax that tax is going to be definitely over there.

128
00:09:47,410 --> 00:09:54,720
And we know that even if the user doesn't give the input we're going to get a string from their right

129
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:55,840
an empty string.

130
00:09:55,840 --> 00:10:00,530
We're not going to get any real value I'm certain of that.

131
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:09,570
So this is over here we are certain that first tax is defined and it's not going to return us.

132
00:10:09,580 --> 00:10:19,690
And Neil value it's going to it's at the verse it's going to return us an empty string and we're making

133
00:10:19,690 --> 00:10:24,750
certain of that by putting this exclamation point in this stage.

134
00:10:24,820 --> 00:10:31,810
And if we add the other one if we add the second one it means that we're certain that we're definitely

135
00:10:31,810 --> 00:10:35,220
going to convert it into an integer.

136
00:10:35,230 --> 00:10:37,800
Let's see if we delete this.

137
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:45,220
And if I come over here and if I write first number it will make this integer an optional integer.

138
00:10:45,220 --> 00:10:45,830
Okay.

139
00:10:45,850 --> 00:10:47,480
And this is okay for X code.

140
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:54,790
This is optional but if I put this this is going to be and not optional.

141
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:57,730
This is going to be a regular integer.

142
00:10:57,970 --> 00:11:04,960
And by this time we're batting we're saying that this is definitely going to be a string and the string

143
00:11:04,990 --> 00:11:14,740
is definitely going to be converted into integer and later on I can just take this result label and

144
00:11:14,740 --> 00:11:20,500
I can say result label dot taxed is now results.

145
00:11:20,500 --> 00:11:21,220
OK.

146
00:11:21,280 --> 00:11:28,630
But I cannot say that because a result labeled that tax is expecting a string from me and I'm giving

147
00:11:28,930 --> 00:11:30,730
an integer to it.

148
00:11:30,730 --> 00:11:31,770
Right.

149
00:11:31,780 --> 00:11:34,450
So I have to convert does into a string.

150
00:11:34,480 --> 00:11:38,290
So I can just go like this string results.

151
00:11:38,560 --> 00:11:44,760
So this will convert result into a string and I can definitely do that once I got the result.

152
00:11:44,860 --> 00:11:49,140
I can definitely make an integer into a text right.

153
00:11:49,150 --> 00:11:52,480
This is going to be okay anyway.

154
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,160
So let me run this and let's see if this works.

155
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,220
So we're going to get the first text.

156
00:11:59,860 --> 00:12:05,050
So let me give this something like 40 or 4 5.

157
00:12:05,080 --> 00:12:06,850
So let me give this 10.

158
00:12:07,180 --> 00:12:11,200
Let me just some them together and here we go the 15.

159
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:15,760
So let me give minus 10 minus five.

160
00:12:15,820 --> 00:12:21,140
So let me give you a big number and let me give a very big number.

161
00:12:21,250 --> 00:12:29,710
So that's still working and it doesn't seem to be crashing but if I come over here and say Apple.

162
00:12:29,850 --> 00:12:30,790
OK.

163
00:12:31,060 --> 00:12:37,000
And if I want to sum them together as you can see it's crashed.

164
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:45,910
So this is definitely going to be this way because as you can see it says that it is unexpectedly found

165
00:12:45,940 --> 00:12:49,180
nil while our opinion optional.

166
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:54,940
So we have said that this is definitely going to be over there but it's not there.

167
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:59,040
We could we couldn't even convert this to be an integer.

168
00:12:59,110 --> 00:13:10,270
So since this integer is not there since this integer is and nil D application crashed and the good

169
00:13:10,270 --> 00:13:13,720
thing is you know how to make this safe.

170
00:13:13,720 --> 00:13:14,430
Right.

171
00:13:14,500 --> 00:13:22,180
You know what to do in a situation like this of course you can go with double question marks or you

172
00:13:22,180 --> 00:13:26,550
can go with default values but v do not want that.

173
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:36,040
We just want to have a safe number and have a safe calculation so that even if the user doesn't give

174
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:43,930
the right input we would not crash the app and we would get the result that we want.

175
00:13:43,930 --> 00:13:46,180
We are going to do that in the next lecture.
