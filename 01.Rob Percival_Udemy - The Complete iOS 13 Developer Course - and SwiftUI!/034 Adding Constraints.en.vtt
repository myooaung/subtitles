Hi.

2
00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.760
We didn't this lecture.

3
00:00:02.770 --> 00:00:11.850
We're going to see how we can leverage constraints in order to make some sustainable views across different

4
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:17.220
kinds of screen sizes different kinds of iPhone models.

5
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:24.140
For example right now in our image view we see that there is a little space in the right hand side on

6
00:00:24.140 --> 00:00:25.110
the left hand side.

7
00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:25.580
Okay.

8
00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:30.390
So there is a space between this project layout label and the Image view as well.

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:41.820
So basically what constraints do they actually define what kind of a space is going to be here here

10
00:00:42.180 --> 00:00:49.540
and between the project layouts of between the image and phone between the project layout and phone.

11
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:53.340
So we're going to predefined these values over here.

12
00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:53.810
Okay.

13
00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.630
So we're going to say whatever the screen size.

14
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:04.800
Just make sure that there is 10 pixels space or ten point space between this project layout and the

15
00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:09.070
top of the phone or write off the phone and project loud.

16
00:01:09.090 --> 00:01:15.660
Make sure there's fifty point space or between Metallica medium between project layout.

17
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:18.170
Make sure there is ten point space.

18
00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:27.570
So we're going to use constraints in order to define these values so that when we try to open this in

19
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:31.140
a different screen size it will be defined right.

20
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:41.460
So whether it's an iPhone X are or rather it's an iPhone s e d x code we'll know that it has to leave

21
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:47.060
some space from the left hand side on the right hand side before showing this picture.

22
00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:54.900
So it wrap the picture around the spaces around these constraints and in order to do that I'm going

23
00:01:54.900 --> 00:02:00.690
to go for the second bottom not the third one that we have worked before but for the second one.

24
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:10.230
So this is constraints but in all cases constraints meaning what we gonna do we gonna add some constraints

25
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:15.660
using this menu and as you can see this is spacing to nearest neighbor.

26
00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:22.380
So far the nearest neighbor for this image right hand side the left hand side and for the top side we

27
00:02:22.380 --> 00:02:29.280
have the project layout and we don't have any other neighbors here.

28
00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:37.980
So for example if we click over there we see the current spaces so we can just choose to go with the

29
00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:45.180
spaces or we can alter them as we want and in the bottom we don't have any neighbor right now so it's

30
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.840
a big number.

31
00:02:46.870 --> 00:02:47.720
Okay.

32
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:57.600
And it doesn't make sense to use that number right now but for upper space for upper bounds we have

33
00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:58.880
to have something.

34
00:02:59.580 --> 00:03:09.060
What do I mean if I click over this red line over here it means that add one constraint so I can just

35
00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:15.720
click on this to add this constraint or I can choose the other ones as well and add three constraints

36
00:03:16.230 --> 00:03:18.470
at once.

37
00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:25.710
So here I'm just gonna go for the current values and add this constrains and see what it looks like.

38
00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:36.620
So if you click on these three constraints you will see that these little blue lines appear in the screen.

39
00:03:36.780 --> 00:03:45.880
So let me zoom in and if I click one of these lines I will see the properties of the constraints themself.

40
00:03:45.990 --> 00:03:52.010
So this is a constraint and I can't reach the constraints from here left hand pane as well.

41
00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:54.170
So click over this.

42
00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.600
And as you can see you can choose the constraint and you can even change the properties of constraints

43
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.140
as well.

44
00:04:01.680 --> 00:04:08.160
So what you have chosen initially is not going to go there forever.

45
00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:12.550
You can choose to change it afterwards.

46
00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:17.610
So as you can see after I do that it gives me some errors.

47
00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:24.900
It says that you have to use some of the constraints to project layout as well because in Metallica

48
00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:29.340
image you added and the constraints to project layout.

49
00:04:29.370 --> 00:04:35.870
So I have connected top of my Metallica image to the bottom of the project layout.

50
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:44.430
So project lay out should have some constraints in our view for us in order for X code to understand

51
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:48.020
where it will place the project layout.

52
00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:49.120
OK.

53
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:53.190
So I can't come over here and I can just say fix it.

54
00:04:53.190 --> 00:04:57.460
It will add the missing constraints but I'm going to do that manually.

55
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:02.340
Later on we're going to see the easiest way of doing these stuff as well.

56
00:05:02.370 --> 00:05:07.280
But for right now we are doing this manually so we can learn.

57
00:05:07.290 --> 00:05:14.910
So with clicking project layouts I'm choosing the new constraints so make sure that project layout is

58
00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:22.500
clicked or else it wouldn't show here as you can see once you click it it will pop up and choosing the

59
00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:23.940
left and right.

60
00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:29.690
And I'm saying at two constraints right now the errors went away I believe.

61
00:05:29.700 --> 00:05:38.950
So it knows where to place project layout and he knows where to place image right now so that's not

62
00:05:38.950 --> 00:05:42.340
perfect yet but I believe we can try this.

63
00:05:42.410 --> 00:05:42.780
OK.

64
00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:48.500
Because we have given our constraints so let's see how this sign.

65
00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:53.830
How does it look like an iPhone as a so I'm writing this on iPhone.

66
00:05:53.830 --> 00:05:55.450
I see one more time.

67
00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:00.760
I remember we weren't seeing the image view at all.

68
00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:03.520
And now we can't see it right.

69
00:06:03.580 --> 00:06:08.390
But there are some still issues I cannot see this project layout.

70
00:06:08.650 --> 00:06:11.920
It seems that it doesn't fit to the screen.

71
00:06:12.220 --> 00:06:15.270
But previously we could see that right.

72
00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:18.470
It shouldn't be because of the text size.

73
00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:22.830
It should be because of the constraints that we have given right now.

74
00:06:23.470 --> 00:06:24.340
And Metallica.

75
00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:26.970
Me image is far below.

76
00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:29.860
So we have to make sure to change that.

77
00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:41.380
If I click one of the constraints I can see its current values like in here I have this 58 and I believe

78
00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:44.830
we made this constraint too large.

79
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:46.590
So it's right.

80
00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.760
Trying to make 58 from each other's side.

81
00:06:50.790 --> 00:06:58.360
So it's trying to push the project layout label from each side so it won't fit.

82
00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:05.590
So that's what we're going to focus on in the next picture we're trying to solve the problems that we

83
00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:10.210
have just created in order to practice constraints a little bit more.
