00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:01.390
Hi.

2
00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:08.670
We did this lecture we're going to learn how to get the user's location so you know good to work with

3
00:00:08.670 --> 00:00:10.200
the user's location.

4
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.580
We're going to use another library rather than MapQuest.

5
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.670
They don't have to be necessarily connected with each other.

6
00:00:18.870 --> 00:00:26.370
We can get the user's location even though we don't have a map or we may not want to get the user location.

7
00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.230
We may just want to display the map as it is.

8
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:36.840
For example suppose that you're building an app for a cafe you may just want to show the current location

9
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.780
of the cafe without getting the user's location.

10
00:00:39.780 --> 00:00:45.060
But we generally want to use them together to have a good user experience.

11
00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.990
The reason I'm telling you all about this is that we have to use another library rather than map kids

12
00:00:52.290 --> 00:00:54.120
to work with user location.

13
00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:56.700
And it's called car location.

14
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:58.890
So I'm going to go ahead and import that.

15
00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:01.980
So it's import car location.

16
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:02.550
OK.

17
00:01:02.610 --> 00:01:05.650
So this is the module that we are looking for.

18
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:13.590
Once we do that we can now work with the user location and in order to do that we're going to have to

19
00:01:13.590 --> 00:01:16.290
do some more set up here as well.

20
00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:21.470
First we are going to create something called location manager.

21
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:22.000
Okay.

22
00:01:22.290 --> 00:01:27.370
So let's say that this is a location manager and it's going to be a.

23
00:01:27.690 --> 00:01:30.460
Location manager.

24
00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:32.700
So what is a location manager.

25
00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:41.670
As you can see this is an object that we use to start and stop the delivery of location related events.

26
00:01:41.700 --> 00:01:48.710
So this is what we need when we actually want to interact with the user location.

27
00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:56.610
So you can use this term manager you will see this term manager when you work with Swift for example

28
00:01:56.610 --> 00:02:01.920
you will see something called or your manager you will see something called location manager.

29
00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:08.800
It means that it manages the related operations regarding to do this kind of action.

30
00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:09.170
OK.

31
00:02:09.180 --> 00:02:16.140
So if you're talking about locations it's manages to relate to the operations regarding the locations

32
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:25.860
so that's a fancy word like manager but it's actually what we use to get the location update the location

33
00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.290
and that's kind of stuff.

34
00:02:28.290 --> 00:02:36.630
So once we defined that we can call it under our we did load and we can start and stop getting updates

35
00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.490
from the user location.

36
00:02:38.910 --> 00:02:42.460
But before we do that we have to make some set up as well.

37
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:49.020
So let's call our location manager and have it as a delegate or we have a controller here.

38
00:02:49.020 --> 00:02:49.910
OK.

39
00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:56.130
So of course once we do that it will give us an error saying that the view controller is not actually

40
00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.500
a Seattle location manager delegate.

41
00:02:58.590 --> 00:03:00.440
So we're going to make it.

42
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:04.630
So this is going to be a single location manager from now on.

43
00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:14.850
And we're now ready to use our location manager first before we go ahead and get the user's location.

44
00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:21.910
I'm going to set some properties of this location manager for example there is something called desired

45
00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.590
day.

46
00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:26.550
It means that's how a create.

47
00:03:26.670 --> 00:03:29.440
I want the location of the user.

48
00:03:29.490 --> 00:03:31.350
Why would I even choose that.

49
00:03:31.350 --> 00:03:31.940
Right.

50
00:03:31.950 --> 00:03:34.170
Just give me the best location.

51
00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:34.890
Right.

52
00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:35.790
I'm going to explain.

53
00:03:35.790 --> 00:03:37.120
Don't worry and I'm.

54
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:41.940
I'm just going to show you the different kinds of options.

55
00:03:41.940 --> 00:03:48.240
We don't have to get the best location available every time if we don't want.

56
00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:54.810
For example let's say that this is the desired take your easy okay location manager that desire.

57
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:01.890
Think you're as safe as you can see it gives us the location accuracy of the data and you cannot get

58
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:04.710
this by just hitting dots over here.

59
00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:10.890
You have to just delete these dots and you have to write something called Casey.

60
00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:12.020
OK.

61
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:18.410
You will see why if you write the case yell you will see it use us as Yeah location accuracy.

62
00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:22.730
And here we have something called location accuracy best.

63
00:04:22.740 --> 00:04:26.190
And this is the best increase that we can get.

64
00:04:26.190 --> 00:04:33.060
Why in the world do we want to use another thing rather than Bast like a kilometer or here.

65
00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:38.460
Because if you choose best it consumes battery the most.

66
00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:39.090
OK.

67
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.420
So you really consume your battery you're to consume your users battery when you choose the accuracy

68
00:04:45.420 --> 00:04:46.760
best.

69
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:54.300
And in our case we need the best because we're tagging some places like we can tag a restaurant or a

70
00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:01.860
cafe and we can we have to find our way back to that place if I choose the km from here.

71
00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:09.930
It can deviate from the original location for like 500 meters and it won't do good to me because we're

72
00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:18.320
building an app for a traveler which has to find the exact spot that he or she has tagged before.

73
00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.920
So I'm going to go for best.

74
00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:27.480
But if you're building an app and if you have claimed something like we're not consuming your battery

75
00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:31.100
we're just performing in an optimal way.

76
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:36.260
So you might want to choose another option from this list.

77
00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:41.310
But in the in our case we have to go for accuracy best.

78
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:50.400
So after doing this next thing to do is actually get the permission of the user because we're going

79
00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.990
to use the current location of the user.

80
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.190
If you say that requests you will see some options.

81
00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.040
So you will see the always authorization and then in use authorization if you choose.

82
00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:11.010
Always authorization it means that you're going to get the user's location always and if you choose

83
00:06:11.010 --> 00:06:19.770
one in use authorization you're only game going to get the users a location then your app is in use.

84
00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:26.520
I'm going to go for one in use authorization because I don't know about you but I just really get suspicious

85
00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:31.470
when some app asks me for my location like every time.

86
00:06:31.470 --> 00:06:34.710
So they will be knowing very my every time.

87
00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.300
Okay.

88
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:39.410
Even though I don't use the app so it's not good for me.

89
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:46.210
So unless you have a real good reason for doubt I suggest you go for the request when you use authorization

90
00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:48.590
and after that just right.

91
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.430
Location manager dot start updating location.

92
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:59.790
So it will get the user's location and give it to us but before we go on and do the rest of the stuff

93
00:06:59.850 --> 00:07:07.130
we have to make sure that we provide an explanation a description like we did in the previous section.

94
00:07:07.160 --> 00:07:13.920
I mean try to reach the users photo library remember now we're reaching the user's location.

95
00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:20.510
So we have to provide this kind of explanation in here so go to your info that pill list and click on

96
00:07:20.510 --> 00:07:24.530
the plus buy them and scroll down for privacy.

97
00:07:24.530 --> 00:07:27.200
So we have done this before right.

98
00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:34.050
Right now we're going to go for location and since we have requested that man in use use it.

99
00:07:34.070 --> 00:07:40.670
So just find the location then in use description every gonna write a description in here.

100
00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:47.360
So you realize it has to be something more clear but just for right now I'm just going to say to get

101
00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:54.230
your location or to get access to your location and this message will be displayed to the user so make

102
00:07:54.230 --> 00:07:57.190
sure that you don't write something stupid in here.

103
00:07:57.190 --> 00:08:05.480
It has to be the a real good reason so that user will understand what's going on in the app and this

104
00:08:05.480 --> 00:08:14.420
time we're actually gonna see this message because it requires the user's permission this time and we're

105
00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:20.630
done actually we're going to get the user's location by doing this but we have to say what will happen

106
00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:23.600
after we get the user's location.

107
00:08:23.600 --> 00:08:28.340
So right now we're getting this location and we're not doing nothing with it.

108
00:08:28.340 --> 00:08:37.940
And in order to do that I'm going to call a function called did update location since we have defined

109
00:08:37.970 --> 00:08:45.470
the Seattle location manager delegate to serve we can use this function we can call this function and

110
00:08:45.470 --> 00:08:47.780
it's called did update locations.

111
00:08:47.780 --> 00:08:48.440
OK.

112
00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:54.230
So I'm calling this function although outside of any function but inside of my class as usual.

113
00:08:54.230 --> 00:09:02.720
And as you can see it gives me a location that array and location has the object type of Seattle location

114
00:09:02.970 --> 00:09:10.010
and where we're going to use these locations array OK so that we can get the user's current location.

115
00:09:10.010 --> 00:09:17.360
So this is the function that I can get the current location from and it gives me an array but I can't

116
00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:25.610
just use any element of that there a like I can say locations and bring me the first element.

117
00:09:25.670 --> 00:09:29.720
OK so I can open a parentheses and say zero.

118
00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:36.800
So this will give me the current location of the user this location and I'm going to work with this

119
00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:45.320
array so that I can do whatever I want to do with this location and in our case I want to get this location

120
00:09:45.650 --> 00:09:48.440
and I want to zoom my map on that location.

121
00:09:48.470 --> 00:09:51.390
So our user will see wherever they are.

122
00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:58.080
So they can tag the current place that they're in and in the Seattle location object.

123
00:09:58.190 --> 00:10:05.170
I will get a latitude and longitude remember latitude and longitude from geography classes.

124
00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.830
So we use the latitude and longitude to create coordinates right.

125
00:10:09.860 --> 00:10:13.410
So let me create a location and you will see what I mean.

126
00:10:13.550 --> 00:10:22.760
I'm going to create a c at location KC at location this one but not actually this object we're going

127
00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:27.040
to search for C a location coordinate to the.

128
00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:33.800
OK so this is as you can see the latitude and longitude associated with the location.

129
00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.890
So we're going to create the location by giving the latitude and longitude.

130
00:10:39.020 --> 00:10:41.000
So where you're going to use this a lot.

131
00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:46.670
So if you open parentheses it will ask you for a latitude and longitude.

132
00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.480
So this will create a location later on.

133
00:10:49.490 --> 00:10:52.670
I'm just going to use that location to zoom in.

134
00:10:53.180 --> 00:10:56.210
So where can I get this latitude from.

135
00:10:56.210 --> 00:10:59.470
Of course I'm going to get it from my locations array.

136
00:10:59.870 --> 00:11:01.210
So it's given to me.

137
00:11:01.370 --> 00:11:08.690
And this is the current user's location remember so I'm getting the current users coordinates here.

138
00:11:08.690 --> 00:11:14.310
So I will find t de latitude by saying that location zero.

139
00:11:14.330 --> 00:11:16.640
The first element of the locations.

140
00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:21.170
And if you heat dot and just write coordinates.

141
00:11:21.170 --> 00:11:21.530
Okay.

142
00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:30.080
Coordinate this one it will give me the coordinates itself and I can just say latitude.

143
00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:38.090
So this is how you reach the latitude and longitude of the current user location and of course I'm going

144
00:11:38.090 --> 00:11:40.990
to do the same thing for the longitude as well.

145
00:11:41.320 --> 00:11:44.500
So locations that coordinate that's longitude.

146
00:11:45.250 --> 00:11:46.270
So here you go.

147
00:11:46.270 --> 00:11:49.180
I have created my location.

148
00:11:49.180 --> 00:11:57.170
Next thing to use on the maps is to create this pattern and it means something like zoom level.

149
00:11:57.280 --> 00:12:02.710
So I'm going to choose how much I want to zoom in in the map.

150
00:12:03.010 --> 00:12:07.210
So this is value created so M.K. coordinates span.

151
00:12:07.270 --> 00:12:10.960
So this defines the width and height of a map region.

152
00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:18.160
So by changing the width and height of a region we change the zoom level actually you'll see what I

153
00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:24.490
mean once we do that these smaller these number the more zoom we will see.

154
00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.830
So I'm going to go for all point one.

155
00:12:26.830 --> 00:12:33.100
Are we going to test other numbers as well to find our optimum number later on.

156
00:12:33.570 --> 00:12:33.960
All right.

157
00:12:33.970 --> 00:12:37.090
Now you can just go for 0.01.

158
00:12:37.090 --> 00:12:41.300
I generally use all point 0 5 by the way in my apps.

159
00:12:41.410 --> 00:12:43.240
So here.

160
00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:49.330
Later on I'm going to create a region by combining this location and span.

161
00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:56.610
So it's called M.K. K in region and it will ask you for a center and this apparent center means where

162
00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.330
I'm going to center this map.

163
00:12:58.460 --> 00:12:58.970
OK.

164
00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:05.840
I'm going to center this around my location so the location will be the current user location.

165
00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:10.990
OK and the spend will be the spend that we have just created.

166
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:20.710
So right now I can just call the map as a map that said center or set regions or is that region here

167
00:13:21.340 --> 00:13:22.800
and Regan to you.

168
00:13:22.870 --> 00:13:25.050
The region that we have created.

169
00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.920
Animation why not.

170
00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:29.290
So let's go for animation.

171
00:13:29.290 --> 00:13:30.640
And here we go.

172
00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:39.130
We actually got the user location we created a location all of that and we have set our map to zoom

173
00:13:39.130 --> 00:13:41.050
into that location.

174
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:48.400
And here you go once you open the app it asks you for your permission you can just say a low while using

175
00:13:48.400 --> 00:13:54.370
app you can just say a low was or don't allow of course I'm not going to go for Donatello and as you

176
00:13:54.370 --> 00:13:58.450
can see our description is written here.

177
00:13:58.750 --> 00:14:06.910
So I'm going to go for love while using the app and remember your description actually gets here.

178
00:14:06.910 --> 00:14:09.800
So make sure you write something good.

179
00:14:09.850 --> 00:14:11.050
And here you go.

180
00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:13.750
I can see the current location.

181
00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:18.110
So this is the Apple's headquarters location actually.

182
00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:23.560
As you can see we're in a simulator so we simulate the location as well.

183
00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:32.900
So in order to change the simulators location you can come here to debug section rather than hardware.

184
00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:33.110
Yeah.

185
00:14:33.130 --> 00:14:39.460
In the debug you will see something called the location and you can choose one of these predefined locations

186
00:14:39.460 --> 00:14:40.520
for example.

187
00:14:40.530 --> 00:14:47.430
We are at the Apple right now and it sees I chose the apples headquarters.

188
00:14:47.590 --> 00:14:51.770
I can choose another location and it will bring me up there.

189
00:14:51.970 --> 00:14:58.910
And I believe they're fairly close to each other so we cannot see it very efficiently.

190
00:14:58.960 --> 00:15:01.820
It moves a little bit but not too much.

191
00:15:01.900 --> 00:15:08.510
You can't come over here to custom location and you can't give your own latitude and longitude.

192
00:15:08.530 --> 00:15:12.110
Let's do that actually let's open the Google map.

193
00:15:12.110 --> 00:15:19.150
So I'm going to go for maps dot google dot com and you can just choose wherever you want.

194
00:15:19.180 --> 00:15:27.910
Let's go for a fellow traveler for example let's see to our example in the introductory lecture remember

195
00:15:28.420 --> 00:15:31.660
and it gives you the location of the Eiffel Tower.

196
00:15:32.520 --> 00:15:38.830
So if you right click here and say what's here you will see the latitude and longitude of the Eiffel

197
00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.430
Tower.

198
00:15:40.450 --> 00:15:41.980
So here you go.

199
00:15:42.010 --> 00:15:47.450
You can also see this latitude and longitude in this you're out tab as well.

200
00:15:47.950 --> 00:15:52.230
So I'm going to get this latitude and longitude.

201
00:15:52.310 --> 00:15:55.960
OK I'm just going to copy them with comments see.

202
00:15:56.170 --> 00:16:01.840
Let's go for both of them actually so that we can do it in the same time.

203
00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:05.590
So let's go for location custom location.

204
00:16:06.010 --> 00:16:12.170
Let's delete this and paste it in here and later on.

205
00:16:12.490 --> 00:16:14.080
I'm gonna delete.

206
00:16:14.110 --> 00:16:20.620
I'm going to cut the longitude I'm pasted in here but it doesn't accept the dots so you have to make

207
00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:25.740
it like every that coma so delete the dots and make it with coma.

208
00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:26.770
Okay.

209
00:16:26.920 --> 00:16:32.320
And you think yet does led to do the longitude from my screen as also the 48.

210
00:16:32.350 --> 00:16:33.220
This is too.

211
00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:41.870
And you have to write the decimals as well that coma once I hit the enter as you can see now I'm display

212
00:16:41.900 --> 00:16:50.660
my map displays actually the map of the PA race so we are now around the Eiffel Tower so it centers

213
00:16:50.870 --> 00:16:55.970
the Eiffel Tower and it zooms in it so that we can't see the map of the Paris.

214
00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:58.660
So far so good.

215
00:16:58.670 --> 00:17:03.130
Now we can actually get the user information on displayed on the map.

216
00:17:03.190 --> 00:17:08.770
Are going to stop here and within the next year we're going to learn how to pin this map.
