1
00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:07,770
Hi within the section we're going to build our first app interacting with internet data.

2
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:14,370
So we're going to be downloading data from the Internet and re going to pass.

3
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:23,510
We are going to process that data so that we can show this data to the user in a format that we want.

4
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:31,020
And in this section we're not going to be working with cloud servers like we're not going to be creating

5
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:31,980
users.

6
00:00:31,980 --> 00:00:35,470
We're not going to write into any database.

7
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:38,100
We're not going to upload any pictures.

8
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:44,820
We're going to learn that later only in the following section then we deal with the five year base in

9
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:45,630
here.

10
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:55,650
We're going to get data from the Internet through something called API an API sense for application

11
00:00:55,830 --> 00:00:57,150
programming interface.

12
00:00:57,150 --> 00:01:00,050
So let me show you how it's spelt.

13
00:01:00,060 --> 00:01:02,460
So this is API.

14
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:02,850
OK.

15
00:01:02,850 --> 00:01:11,450
And if you search Google for API as you can see it stands for application programming interface and

16
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:12,920
we're going to see whether that is.

17
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:14,360
Don't worry.

18
00:01:14,660 --> 00:01:24,120
Now we can use this application programming interfaces in order to provide data to mobile applications

19
00:01:24,390 --> 00:01:32,190
to web applications to softwares from our server from our platform.

20
00:01:32,190 --> 00:01:42,690
For example Google has some API is Facebook some as has some API and Twitter has some API with using

21
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:50,550
this API so we can reach the data of Facebook through either Google and other platforms other Web sites

22
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:57,060
or other servers so that we can use their data safely in our apps.

23
00:01:57,060 --> 00:01:57,610
OK.

24
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:05,310
That's what we're going to do within this section we're going to get data from application programming

25
00:02:05,370 --> 00:02:13,520
interface and we're going to process that data so that we can use it in a way that we want.

26
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,300
For example if you search for Facebook API you will see this Web site.

27
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:26,370
This is developers dot Facebook dot com and you can actually use those API s in order to reach data

28
00:02:26,370 --> 00:02:28,800
user data in Facebook.

29
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:37,890
For example you can ask users to sign in with their Facebook account so that you can reach their followers

30
00:02:37,890 --> 00:02:45,570
you can reach their friends and do something with it and you can get their statistics and you can do

31
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:47,260
that in three there as well.

32
00:02:47,490 --> 00:02:55,020
So if you search for three either API as you can see this has some documentation regarding the Twitter's

33
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,640
API as well.

34
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:06,840
So again you can use this API of Twitter in order to get the user data up from twitter servers.

35
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:16,710
So as you can see some platform some servers some applications use API is in order to provide data to

36
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,230
other softwares like mobile applications web applications.

37
00:03:21,240 --> 00:03:22,170
OK.

38
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:31,650
And not only these big projects not only these big companies do that you can actually use whatever API

39
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,920
you want.

40
00:03:33,150 --> 00:03:37,000
For example you can search for a vendor API.

41
00:03:37,020 --> 00:03:37,310
OK.

42
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:46,350
So you can get the weather forecasts out of various API is as you can see we have a lot of examples

43
00:03:46,350 --> 00:03:47,200
in here.

44
00:03:47,370 --> 00:03:51,850
And in this section we're going to build a quote currency converter.

45
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:52,480
OK.

46
00:03:52,530 --> 00:03:58,780
So if you search for currency converter API you will see a lot of options as well.

47
00:03:58,860 --> 00:04:05,250
And in this section I'm going to be using one of these API is actually in real time so that you can

48
00:04:05,250 --> 00:04:14,580
see how we can get data out of that Web site and how we can integrate that data in our application.

49
00:04:14,610 --> 00:04:17,540
So we are going to be converting currencies.

50
00:04:17,630 --> 00:04:24,240
We are going to display some kind of different currencies to the users.

51
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:31,380
So we're going to get the euro currency zone we're going to convert that currency into dollars Japanese

52
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,600
yen like Swiss franc.

53
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:34,660
OK.

54
00:04:34,680 --> 00:04:38,360
And I'm going to use this fixer dot I.

55
00:04:39,030 --> 00:04:46,290
So this is one of the API guys and I randomly chose this I tested it and it works fine.

56
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:49,590
So we're going to be using that in your own time.

57
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:53,470
You can try to work with another API as well.

58
00:04:53,490 --> 00:04:59,400
However at the time being since you don't know how to work with API is I really suggest you stick with

59
00:04:59,400 --> 00:05:02,760
me and I'll follow this fixer that I owe.

60
00:05:02,770 --> 00:05:03,990
Example.

61
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:09,180
So in fixer that I oh we're going to get a data like this.

62
00:05:09,190 --> 00:05:09,790
Okay.

63
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:12,140
As you can see it provides one hand.

64
00:05:12,150 --> 00:05:19,740
One hundred and seventy worlds curiously so this displays a huge data to us.

65
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:24,550
This displays a lot of currencies in their own data.

66
00:05:24,640 --> 00:05:30,970
And if you click on this price you will see we have a free option and that's one of the reasons why

67
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:32,620
we're using this API.

68
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:36,540
So we're going to work with free version of course.

69
00:05:36,550 --> 00:05:42,480
But as you can see there are a lot of options in here like a basic one a professional one.

70
00:05:42,580 --> 00:05:50,670
And of course we have some limitations on the free version like we get only hourly updates we get limited

71
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:57,500
support historical data and 1000 API calls per month.

72
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:04,930
So in hearing the basic version as you can see you get 10000 API calls in the professional Virgin get

73
00:06:05,200 --> 00:06:14,000
a hundred thousand API calls and in the professional plus you get like 500000 API calls.

74
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:21,910
So if you if you're going to be working with more of course you can just contact the fixer that's IO

75
00:06:21,910 --> 00:06:31,570
and you can get a pricing out of day your sales representatives and if you have a big Web site or if

76
00:06:31,570 --> 00:06:39,250
you have a big application you can use this professional plus for example in order to display the real

77
00:06:39,250 --> 00:06:43,510
time data as you can see it provides 60 second updates.

78
00:06:43,510 --> 00:06:46,390
So this is actually real time.

79
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:54,940
So you get the real time currency numbers around the world so that you can display them to your user

80
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,370
and coding will not differ between these versions.

81
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:01,320
OK.

82
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:06,740
We will just write the same codes whatever we choose in here.

83
00:07:06,790 --> 00:07:10,060
So that's why we're going to go with the basic form.

84
00:07:10,070 --> 00:07:13,300
We're going to go with the free one in fact.

85
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:18,760
And after that we're going to process this data and show this data to the user.

86
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:24,490
That's why within the next lecture we going to cover something called Jason for Matt.
