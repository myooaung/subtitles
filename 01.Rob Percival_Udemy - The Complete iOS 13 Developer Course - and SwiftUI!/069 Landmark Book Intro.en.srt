00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,320
Within this section we're going to learn about table we use to table views are views that provide us

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:12,080
tools in order to display data in our race.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:18,330
So this is so important that we are going to use it in most of the apps that we're ever going to create

4
00:00:18,570 --> 00:00:26,130
in this course and we're going to be building some app called landmark book in order to practice that

5
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:27,460
right now.

6
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:36,550
We know enough swift and U.S. development so that we can actually create apps to learn about new concepts.

7
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:40,410
So from now on course will only get better.

8
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:42,840
So if you're ready let's get started.
