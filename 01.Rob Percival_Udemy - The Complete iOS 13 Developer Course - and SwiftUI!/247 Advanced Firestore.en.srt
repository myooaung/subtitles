00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:01,100
Hi.

2
00:00:01,210 --> 00:00:02,500
We didn't does lecture.

3
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:09,810
We're going to change our upload functionality so that we will have two images inside of only one document

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,960
so that we can consolidate all snaps and show them in only one post.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,610
So how are we going to do that.

6
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:25,470
I'm going to show you a way to do that but you can actually come up with a better idea later on if you

7
00:00:25,470 --> 00:00:26,680
want.

8
00:00:26,700 --> 00:00:30,950
So let me show you how this goes when I upload an image.

9
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:38,690
This will create a document because I'm making it do so rather than uploading one single image.

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:47,130
I'm going to upload an image URL array to the fires store and then later on I'm going to check to see

11
00:00:47,190 --> 00:00:52,150
if the snap owner has previously uploaded that snap.

12
00:00:52,200 --> 00:01:00,930
So if that's the case I'm just going to take the same document and upload a new version of that imagery

13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:07,320
so I'm not going to add a new document but I'm just going to update the current document.

14
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:19,500
OK so before we go on and use the snap dictionary over here we're going to have a check and in fact

15
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,610
this is all related to storage over here right.

16
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:29,880
So let me write storage and from this point on we're working with fires start.

17
00:01:30,510 --> 00:01:37,230
So we're going to leave the storage as it is because we want to save them to the storage eventually

18
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:38,190
anyway.

19
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:46,640
But in the fire store we're going to have an if statement before we do that we have to have an if statement.

20
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:53,190
So as I said before I'm going to check to see if this snap owner has a previously published snap on

21
00:01:53,190 --> 00:01:54,640
the fire store.

22
00:01:54,780 --> 00:02:00,030
So I'm going to go over here I say fire started that collection snaps.

23
00:02:00,130 --> 00:02:00,970
Okay.

24
00:02:01,080 --> 00:02:03,820
And I'm going to have a very field.

25
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:07,330
So this very field will look for the snap owner.

26
00:02:07,620 --> 00:02:10,140
So I'm going to say snap owner.

27
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:10,940
OK.

28
00:02:11,010 --> 00:02:16,990
And this will be equal to user Singleton that shared user info that user name.

29
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,230
And if that's the case then I'm going to get the documents.

30
00:02:22,230 --> 00:02:28,320
I'm not going to add Snapchat listener because I just need to do it once.

31
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:34,230
So I'm going to say get documents and this will give me either a snapshot or an error.

32
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:38,400
So in here I'm going to check to see if error is not nil.

33
00:02:38,460 --> 00:02:43,810
So if this is the case I can just show an error error message to the user.

34
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:50,640
So let's say error that's error that localized description over here with double question marks with

35
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:51,340
error.

36
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:58,070
OK and else if that's the case then I should have some snapshot.

37
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:05,380
But in any case I'm going to check to see if snapshots dot is empty is false.

38
00:03:05,640 --> 00:03:06,420
OK.

39
00:03:06,600 --> 00:03:08,890
And if snapshot is not nil.

40
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:13,100
So like this snapshot is not nil.

41
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:20,370
So if that's the case then I should have the snapshot so I can come over here into a forward document

42
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:25,500
for loop for document in snapshot that documents.

43
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:25,990
OK.

44
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:34,340
So I'm getting going to assign every document to a variable called document so that I can get to see

45
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,810
its image you're all right.

46
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:44,940
OK so let me get the document I.D. because we're going to use it later on as I said before because we're

47
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,620
going to update one single document you're not going to create one.

48
00:03:49,620 --> 00:03:56,700
So we need this document I.D. right so you know how this works as well.

49
00:03:56,710 --> 00:04:02,040
We have seen this in the like functionality in the Instagram clone but don't worry I'm going to show

50
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,820
it show it anyway.

51
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,150
So after that we have to check to see the image your real array.

52
00:04:08,170 --> 00:04:11,260
But right now we don't even have an image url.

53
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:13,910
We array we just have an image here.

54
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:20,750
So first we have to make sure that we're saving this in an array not a single string.

55
00:04:20,800 --> 00:04:27,940
So I'm going to come over here to my saving initial saving function and I'm going to call this image

56
00:04:27,950 --> 00:04:35,150
URL array and I'm going to wrap this inside of an array braces so that it will be uploaded as an image

57
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:37,180
every image your gallery.

58
00:04:37,270 --> 00:04:38,050
OK.

59
00:04:38,050 --> 00:04:41,060
Actually this is just a string array string.

60
00:04:41,150 --> 00:04:50,430
OK so later on I can come over here to my if statement and I can check to see if I can get this image

61
00:04:50,430 --> 00:04:54,090
rural area out of my fires sir.

62
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,590
So let me call this image your Earl area.

63
00:04:57,650 --> 00:05:01,240
I'm using it for because I'm going to change it later on.

64
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,070
So rather than just saying it flat you can just say far and just say document that.

65
00:05:07,070 --> 00:05:09,490
Get image URL array.

66
00:05:09,530 --> 00:05:14,250
I'm going to cast this as an array of strings like this.

67
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:20,840
OK if that's the case if I can get it what I want to do is to update this.

68
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:27,790
So I'm going to say image I'll array that append am going to append the newly created image here Elif

69
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,430
over here OK.

70
00:05:30,510 --> 00:05:36,290
And I'm gonna first cast as one more time first line wrapped as one more time.

71
00:05:36,690 --> 00:05:43,840
And if that's the case then I'm going to re upload this to the file your store so that I can update

72
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:50,610
it in the document that I'm looking for and the way to do this is to qualify your store one more time

73
00:05:50,970 --> 00:05:57,210
and go to the snaps and you have to specify the document path as well because we're only interested

74
00:05:57,330 --> 00:05:59,310
in that document.

75
00:05:59,310 --> 00:06:03,200
So that's how you actually updated document.

76
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:05,570
You can come over here on set data.

77
00:06:05,820 --> 00:06:14,900
And remember we have to use this merge as well in order to prevent other values from the leading yes

78
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,040
vote.

79
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,450
So let's choose this one.

80
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:21,030
And remember we have other values over here.

81
00:06:21,040 --> 00:06:27,980
I think we don't say merge it will delete the existing one and we will only end up with the image you're

82
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:32,050
all airy and we will lose the Post owner and date values.

83
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:34,120
So merge will be true.

84
00:06:34,330 --> 00:06:35,330
OK.

85
00:06:35,400 --> 00:06:42,780
And the error will be given to us if there is any error you can check to see if error is not nil or

86
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:44,470
is nil actually.

87
00:06:44,490 --> 00:06:49,980
So if error is nil then we want to go to our feed we have controller over here.

88
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:57,960
But right now let me create my additional dictionary because we're just doing an additional information

89
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:02,780
over here we're just uploading an incrementally information.

90
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,640
So we're going to upload the image URL array only and it has to be exactly the same.

91
00:07:08,790 --> 00:07:12,270
So it has to be spelled exactly the same.

92
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:12,870
Okay.

93
00:07:13,050 --> 00:07:18,570
So be aware of that and you can come over here and say additional dictionary.

94
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:19,950
So that's it.

95
00:07:19,950 --> 00:07:22,690
That's how you update the value.

96
00:07:22,710 --> 00:07:23,160
Okay.

97
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:30,480
And of course you're going to have to cut this from here because if that's the case we don't want to

98
00:07:30,480 --> 00:07:31,200
do that.

99
00:07:31,230 --> 00:07:31,640
Right.

100
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:42,420
But if that's not the case then after uploading my image to the storage then after I check to see if

101
00:07:42,510 --> 00:07:52,040
this snap owner has a previous snap and if that's the case I'm doing my thing to update the value okay.

102
00:07:52,350 --> 00:08:00,480
And if that's not the case if this user doesn't have a previous snap in the fire store then I should

103
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,930
just create a neat document.

104
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,340
Right.

105
00:08:04,410 --> 00:08:09,840
So I can come over here to if var or I believe.

106
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:10,360
Yep.

107
00:08:10,390 --> 00:08:13,260
This we have to come over here.

108
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:16,290
Actually we have to come over to the snapshot right.

109
00:08:16,320 --> 00:08:22,940
If snapshot is not nearly it means that I have a snapshot and I how free we is.

110
00:08:23,160 --> 00:08:24,710
Snap over here.

111
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:34,350
So if I say else then I can just cut my uploading function to here so that if the user doesn't have

112
00:08:34,380 --> 00:08:41,850
any previous snapshot if the user doesn't have any previous snaps then I can just upload a new one so

113
00:08:41,850 --> 00:08:45,240
that I can create a new document over here.

114
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:46,120
Right.

115
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:53,160
So this is how our upload functionality will look like this is a little bit complicated than what we

116
00:08:53,160 --> 00:09:00,470
have been doing so far but this will give us a great structure to continue building our Snapchat clone

117
00:09:01,730 --> 00:09:06,400
so if we succeed over here it will take us to the tab bar controller.

118
00:09:06,950 --> 00:09:15,160
And if we succeed over here it should take us to the tab bar controller index 1 as well index 0 as well.

119
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:21,430
So I'm going to say South tab bar controller that selected index is zero.

120
00:09:21,470 --> 00:09:28,940
And of course I'm going to change the upload image view as well and I'm going to call this UI image

121
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:37,870
and it will have the name of select image that PMG lets see select image that PMG yes.

122
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:39,770
So here you go.

123
00:09:39,770 --> 00:09:42,860
Now we are ready to test this.

124
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:47,880
So let me come over to my father's star and delete everything before we test.

125
00:09:47,900 --> 00:09:55,160
Because I want to see if my original functionality stays the same or not.

126
00:09:55,190 --> 00:10:01,360
And we don't have images URL areas inside of that document anyway.

127
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:10,650
So after deleting everything just run your new code in the simulator and there comes the moment of truth.

128
00:10:10,670 --> 00:10:13,690
So let me come over here and upload new things.

129
00:10:13,820 --> 00:10:14,780
OK.

130
00:10:14,810 --> 00:10:21,920
Like this one this monkey and hit the upload function and here we go.

131
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:23,720
Now we are inside of the feed.

132
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:29,800
So if I come over here and refresh this I can see the newly created document.

133
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:31,340
Right.

134
00:10:31,340 --> 00:10:34,190
So let's select that document.

135
00:10:34,190 --> 00:10:34,910
And here you go.

136
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:39,620
Now we have an image rural area rather than an image URL string.

137
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:48,440
So let's try to add one more image to see if we get the additional image over here.

138
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:55,270
So if I click on over here and select another picture like this OK and upload it.

139
00:10:55,370 --> 00:10:57,110
So pay attention to the file.

140
00:10:57,110 --> 00:10:58,020
Yes sir.

141
00:10:58,040 --> 00:10:59,590
Let's see what will happen.

142
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:00,260
Here you go.

143
00:11:00,260 --> 00:11:08,330
Now it got uploaded and it didn't change the documents at all but it only added VAM image URL to the

144
00:11:08,330 --> 00:11:09,740
image you're all right.

145
00:11:09,770 --> 00:11:13,070
And that's exactly what I want.

146
00:11:13,220 --> 00:11:16,450
As you can see now we are seeing the real time updates.

147
00:11:16,450 --> 00:11:21,780
So let me try this one more time and so that we can see it one more time.

148
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,700
OK.

149
00:11:22,730 --> 00:11:24,420
Pay attention to the firestorm.

150
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:27,420
Once I hit the upload button.

151
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:29,920
So here we go we clicked the upload button.
