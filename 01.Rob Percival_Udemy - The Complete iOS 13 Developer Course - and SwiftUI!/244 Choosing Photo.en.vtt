00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:07.650
Hi within this lecture regarding to take care of this upload view controller we want to choose a picture

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.080
from photo gallery.

3
00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:17.190
So we're gonna just implement this features very fast because we have done it several times from now

4
00:00:17.190 --> 00:00:17.630
on.

5
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:25.230
So I have to have a tab to select picture over here so I'm going to create this inside of my sketch

6
00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:33.600
so that you can actually let people know that they have to click on this image view to side picture.

7
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:39.480
Now as you can see I'm doing that in sketch so you can do that in photoshop.

8
00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:40.890
You can do that in paint.

9
00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.960
You can do that wherever you want.

10
00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:48.700
You can use my own picture from github account so please yourself.

11
00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:57.420
So I'm going to have the green file over here and I'm just going to add some text on this and I'm going

12
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:00.560
to say something like tap to select picture.

13
00:01:00.570 --> 00:01:05.730
OK so let's say tap to select image.

14
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:06.290
OK.

15
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:14.850
So let me make this a little bit bigger because I believe we have some room to go over that's like this.

16
00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:17.590
Yep I believe that's good.

17
00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:23.040
So let me export this file so that we can use it in our image view.

18
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.560
I'm going to name this something like SELECT image.

19
00:01:26.570 --> 00:01:34.950
OK now I'm going to export this SPF Energy and I don't want to save this for vamp I believe.

20
00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:37.950
So let me uncheck design and save it.

21
00:01:38.190 --> 00:01:39.000
And here you go.

22
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.510
Now I can delete this and I have to bring this in.

23
00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:50.010
So let me open my assets folder first and I'm going to bring this in.

24
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.690
So here you go.

25
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:58.830
Now let me go to my main story Bart because I'm going to bring in this image using my Image view.

26
00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.510
Now user will know to tap here.

27
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:05.740
So let me go to my settings.

28
00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:06.660
No upload.

29
00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:13.680
We have controller because in the upload we have controller we want to have a clickable Image view.

30
00:02:13.710 --> 00:02:17.390
So first thing to do is say upload the image view.

31
00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:20.610
That is user interaction enabled is true.

32
00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:21.480
OK.

33
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:26.010
And then later on I'm going to create my gesture recognizing it as usual.

34
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.170
So this will be a UI tap gesture recognized.

35
00:02:29.490 --> 00:02:32.660
And this will ask us for a target and a selector.

36
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.300
So Target will be self.

37
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:36.390
So I think there will be a function.

38
00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:45.800
So I'm going to create that function over here so this is an object to see function choose picture.

39
00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:47.140
OK.

40
00:02:47.220 --> 00:02:56.780
And I'm going to give this as a selector over here later on I can just say upload Image view dot at

41
00:02:56.820 --> 00:03:04.200
gesture cognizant and I'm going to add our gesture recognize there over here later on I'm going to create

42
00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200
a picture.

43
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.590
So this will be a you I image picture.

44
00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.150
OK.

45
00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:17.700
So you I image speaker controller yep this one and this will the speaker will have the delegate as s

46
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.030
and once we do that we have to come over here and they sign this.

47
00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:29.280
We have controller to be a UI image speaker controller delegate and a UI navigation controller delegate.

48
00:03:29.700 --> 00:03:30.200
OK.

49
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:38.640
So once we do that we can come over here and specify the source type as well as photo library and then

50
00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:42.450
I can just present this and say so that present.

51
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:49.290
So present the speaker which of course affirmation and without any completion.

52
00:03:49.290 --> 00:03:56.750
So after we had to specify what will happen once the user chooses the picture in order to do that we're

53
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.760
going to call that function called did finish speaking.

54
00:03:59.910 --> 00:04:06.910
OK so this one remember this gives us an informal dictionary and we are going to say upload image view

55
00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:14.400
that image will come from this info dictionary and we are looking for an original image and we're going

56
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:21.040
to cast this as a UI image so we can dismiss this later on.

57
00:04:21.370 --> 00:04:23.130
And animation will be true.

58
00:04:23.130 --> 00:04:24.730
Completion will be nil.

59
00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:26.760
So let's test that.

60
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:35.670
Let's open our simulator and if we can see the picture in our UI Image view then it means that we are

61
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:40.790
going to be ready to upload our picture to the server.

62
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.620
And that's very gets exciting.

63
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:51.590
OK because we get to work with models we get to well see the advanced features of our year base.

64
00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:56.900
So let me click over here and open any photo from photo library.

65
00:04:57.030 --> 00:04:57.780
And here you go.

66
00:04:57.780 --> 00:05:05.020
Now we can see it now all we have to do is just to implement this upload feature.

67
00:05:05.020 --> 00:05:12.910
And again this will be exciting because we're not going to upload this feature as it is as we have done

68
00:05:12.910 --> 00:05:13.610
before.

69
00:05:13.660 --> 00:05:21.100
We have to figure out a way to upload the user name to the fire store and also we have to figure out

70
00:05:21.100 --> 00:05:31.690
a way to group all of this picture into one post so that we won't see some Instagram like feed but rather

71
00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:38.170
we just going to see some snapchat like feed and we're going to do that within the next lecture.
