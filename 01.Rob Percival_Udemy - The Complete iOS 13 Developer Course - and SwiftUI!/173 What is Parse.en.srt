00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,260
Hi.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,770
We didn't this lecture we going to understand what is passe and why do we need it.

3
00:00:06,870 --> 00:00:11,030
And why do we want to use it when we have five year base.

4
00:00:11,060 --> 00:00:11,480
Okay.

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,650
So where are you going to see what this person.

6
00:00:13,650 --> 00:00:18,110
What are the main differences between pass and fire base.

7
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:24,720
So in order to do that before we create a project I'm going to go over my safari or another browser.

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,380
Obviously I'm going to search for parts.

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,030
So the first result that we're going to get is parse platform dot arc.

10
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:37,070
So this is the official Web site of the pass.

11
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:45,990
So pass provides us a great tool to work in cloud servers and connect our server with our project with

12
00:00:46,080 --> 00:00:47,610
its backend services.

13
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:53,060
So it's kind of fire base but this is completely open source.

14
00:00:53,580 --> 00:01:02,730
So far your base is run by Google at this time and fire base is actually maintained in the fire base

15
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:05,860
a Google servers but in PA.

16
00:01:05,870 --> 00:01:13,670
So we don't get any ready servers so we can get the parts and deploy it in any server that we want.

17
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:21,480
So this is the main difference between far your base and pass in fact pass was owned by Facebook in

18
00:01:21,480 --> 00:01:30,720
previous years and pass had its own servers like we get to go to Paris platform dot org and create an

19
00:01:30,720 --> 00:01:37,200
account and just create a server and just start to work within the server.

20
00:01:37,230 --> 00:01:45,490
But now this is all open source and we get to get the pass codes in the server side and we get to deploy

21
00:01:45,490 --> 00:01:47,370
it any device we want.

22
00:01:47,510 --> 00:01:55,650
And in here if you come below a little bit you will see that this works on other platforms like we.

23
00:01:55,700 --> 00:02:04,500
We have seen in the firebase as well so it works on Io as Android javascript unity BHP and the other

24
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:05,850
platforms as well.

25
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:13,590
Of course we are going to focus on ISIS but if you're thinking about releasing a multi-platform app

26
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:19,050
as well then this will do the job for you as we did in the base.

27
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:27,660
So some of these students some of the users actually find fire base a little bit more complicated when

28
00:02:27,660 --> 00:02:29,910
it comes to simplicity.

29
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:38,820
So they can choose parts over fire but in order to have more easy to use system more easy to use as

30
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:40,210
the case.

31
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:43,890
But this has also some disadvantages as well.

32
00:02:44,490 --> 00:02:50,900
So in your base We do relive couriers much better than in parts.

33
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:59,070
So my suggestion is that you just watch to your base section and you just watch two parts section and

34
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:02,910
then you can decide what to use on your own.

35
00:03:03,090 --> 00:03:10,680
But if you need something like real time data what is if you're building something like a chat app if

36
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,330
you need a data from the server in less than one second.

37
00:03:15,330 --> 00:03:23,220
My suggestion is to go with fire base and if you don't need that you can always try firebase umpires

38
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:25,800
and decide on your own OK.

39
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:33,100
And you're going to see this actually very easy to use and this is actually very easy to operate.

40
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:40,410
And we are going to build a Foursquare clone for example in the section so that we won't need anything

41
00:03:40,410 --> 00:03:44,350
in less than one second so we can safely use parts.

42
00:03:44,490 --> 00:03:46,410
In that case.

43
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:54,930
So if you click over the IRS then you will get to see the github of the pass SDK for AOS and you will

44
00:03:54,930 --> 00:04:03,510
see the documentation to install this pass pass as the case into your X code project.

45
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:07,140
But as I said before this is not enough.

46
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:12,260
We have to find a server to run our power server on.

47
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:17,250
So there are a couple of ways to do that before previously.

48
00:04:17,310 --> 00:04:22,230
We have actually told how to use this in Amazon servers.

49
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:22,570
OK.

50
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:31,050
In Iaw yes but now I suggest you go to this back for app dot com and use that power server over here

51
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,370
because it's much more better than.

52
00:04:34,460 --> 00:04:40,700
Then we compare this to the AWB yes two years ago we didn't have this OK.

53
00:04:40,710 --> 00:04:47,770
We had to work with either with us or any other server but now we have this and it's much better.

54
00:04:48,180 --> 00:04:55,860
But in any case I'm going to show you to and ideal yes Web site as well if you want to go and deploy

55
00:04:55,860 --> 00:05:04,390
your own server you may do that in Amazon but right now in this section I'm going to build my pasture

56
00:05:04,460 --> 00:05:12,620
reusing back for app and you will see this is very user friendly very easy to use and very easy to actually

57
00:05:12,620 --> 00:05:19,310
create an account with free trials of course you can just start for free.

58
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:27,140
And it does has its own limitations you can come over here and look pricing as well like in firebase

59
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:36,220
when you actually exceed a certain quota hours certain amount of users you may have to create a premium

60
00:05:36,220 --> 00:05:37,630
account as well.

61
00:05:38,390 --> 00:05:43,810
So I cannot seem to open a double yes for some reason.

62
00:05:43,910 --> 00:05:45,890
So let me google it from here.

63
00:05:45,890 --> 00:05:47,910
Maybe then we will see it.

64
00:05:47,990 --> 00:05:49,040
It's actually that.

65
00:05:49,050 --> 00:05:50,780
Yes that's Amazon dot com.

66
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:51,020
Yep.

67
00:05:51,050 --> 00:05:51,680
This one.

68
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:59,960
So this is Amazon Web Services and they provide cloud computing services in which you can find ready

69
00:05:59,960 --> 00:06:02,200
to deploy power servers as well.

70
00:06:02,480 --> 00:06:09,320
But as I said before we're not going to do that in the section because it's not practical and it's not

71
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:18,170
as good as back for app because back for app actually improved the PA server by their own improvements

72
00:06:18,170 --> 00:06:19,730
by their own development.

73
00:06:19,730 --> 00:06:27,290
So we get to see something some cool features like add I mean app push notifications and other stuff

74
00:06:27,290 --> 00:06:27,890
as well.

75
00:06:28,640 --> 00:06:35,230
So we're going to use these documentation to bring pass as the case into our X code project and we're

76
00:06:35,250 --> 00:06:42,770
going to use back for app documentations in order to connect our server with our X gold project.

77
00:06:43,010 --> 00:06:43,750
Okay.

78
00:06:44,030 --> 00:06:50,900
So we have a lot to do in the section I believe now we are ready to stop here and we didn't the next

79
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:55,640
lecture we're going to create our X code project and bring the process the case in.
