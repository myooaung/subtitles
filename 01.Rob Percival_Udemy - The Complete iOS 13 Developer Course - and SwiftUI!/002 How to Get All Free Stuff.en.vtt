00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.040
Hi.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:07.890
We didn't this lecture we going to see how we can get the free stuff that comes with this curse and

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.580
in fact you don't have to do that right now.

4
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:17.090
But if you want to get free stuff before starting this course then you're more than welcome to do it.

5
00:00:17.100 --> 00:00:22.170
So let me show you how you can access the free stuff and buy free stuff.

6
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:29.340
I mean the unlimited hosting package that comes with this course and it's worth something like 100 pounds

7
00:00:29.340 --> 00:00:33.070
right now and it's limited to one year.

8
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:40.470
And in addition to that you will get a free search vacation for swift level one from the Cambridge search

9
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:49.620
vacation authority and also swift level two tests so you will hide some free enrollment codes in order

10
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:52.880
to come and take these certifications.

11
00:00:53.160 --> 00:01:01.530
And on the top of everything you will get three hundred dollars worth of assets that you can use in

12
00:01:01.530 --> 00:01:05.460
your apps when you try to do a good design.

13
00:01:05.460 --> 00:01:09.110
I will show you then to use those things don't work.

14
00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:15.540
But in order to get all of this free things you have to go to does that for each.

15
00:01:15.870 --> 00:01:23.130
So you will find this web page you will find is your URL in the resources of this lecture or after this

16
00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:24.230
lecture.

17
00:01:24.240 --> 00:01:24.930
OK.

18
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:32.760
So when you click on it it will ask you to provide an email address and password and a you then use

19
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:33.220
your name.

20
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:39.150
So you're creating an eco that hosting account over here.

21
00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:43.650
So it doesn't have to be exactly the same e-mail address and password.

22
00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:52.120
Obviously with you to me but the using user name must be the same number to get your you them user name.

23
00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:54.420
You can go to your Udemy page.

24
00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:54.860
OK.

25
00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:56.450
So let me go to you me.

26
00:01:56.460 --> 00:02:05.360
Dot com and after you log in you can come to your profile from here and say View Public Profile.

27
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:11.470
So when you do that if you click over here you can get this part.

28
00:02:11.490 --> 00:02:15.610
So in my case this is a teal some too.

29
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:16.420
OK.

30
00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:19.580
And I have to include these dashes as well.

31
00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:31.740
So I will copy this OK and come over here to paste in my user name so off to date I have to make sure

32
00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:41.220
that my profile over here my public profile shows the courses that I'm enrolled in in order to make

33
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.510
sure of this.

34
00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:51.210
You can come to your profile settings one more time and in the privacy section you will see an option

35
00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:55.460
like that show courses you're taking on your profile page.

36
00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:02.070
If it's not enabled in your case make sure it's enabled and saved.

37
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:08.130
Of course you can change this after you enroll to the eco web posting.

38
00:03:08.220 --> 00:03:15.570
But before you enroll you have to make sure that this is selected in here.

39
00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:24.060
OK after you do that you can just come over here and give some e-mail address and password.

40
00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:33.870
So in my case I'm going to go for still some test at gmail dot com and for some password.

41
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:37.380
Let me give my own password over here like that.

42
00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.280
OK.

43
00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:45.750
And if I say sign up it will try to understand if I'm really enrolled in that course.

44
00:03:45.870 --> 00:03:50.630
And as you can see now I'm signed up successfully.

45
00:03:50.700 --> 00:03:57.870
So when you do sign up to this it will just ask you for these options.

46
00:03:57.870 --> 00:04:04.860
So if you want to get a Getting Started Guide for free of course you can just enable this.

47
00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:14.670
And I will just select them all because I want to receive some tips some documentation regarding to

48
00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:22.290
all of this and then I'm just going to go to the same e-mail that I have already provided.

49
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.540
OK.

50
00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:31.130
And I don't have any comments or suggestions at this point so I'm just going to submit it.

51
00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.430
So once you do that it will take you to this Web site.

52
00:04:35.430 --> 00:04:36.090
OK.

53
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.050
So this is Ecolab posting that code out the UK.

54
00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:45.900
And over here you're signed in with your account.

55
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:53.910
So if you come to your account over here you will see your account summary.

56
00:04:54.510 --> 00:05:01.780
And right now in fact you can add a hosting package and start with your free hosting package in this

57
00:05:01.780 --> 00:05:02.640
case.

58
00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:05.350
But there is a way to do that.

59
00:05:05.470 --> 00:05:12.340
You have to do that when you try to create a website to market your app after you build your app.

60
00:05:12.340 --> 00:05:14.450
I'm just going to show you exactly.

61
00:05:14.590 --> 00:05:17.320
Then you should do that.

62
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:23.680
But before you start maybe you want to see all the free stuff that comes with the scores and in order

63
00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:24.350
to do that.

64
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:31.180
If you come here to your account summary you can just click on this view and update my profile and you

65
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:34.870
will see your courses over here.

66
00:05:34.870 --> 00:05:39.970
So we are interested in this complete IRS 13 developer course.

67
00:05:39.970 --> 00:05:43.260
And as you can see we are signed up.

68
00:05:43.510 --> 00:05:50.530
Now you can just reach the course by clicking on this link and it will take you to the Udemy link as

69
00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:51.600
usual.

70
00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:57.430
But if you scroll down you will see the course extras.

71
00:05:57.940 --> 00:05:59.920
So there is a surprise for you.

72
00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:06.090
You can get the how to earn ten thousand dollars while you're learning to code.

73
00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:09.040
And this is a free e-book.

74
00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:12.940
And this e-book is written by Rob Percival himself.

75
00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.280
So I suggest you download it from here and read it.

76
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:18.020
OK.

77
00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:27.850
While you're learning to code and under here you can find the IRS graphical assets worth 300 dollars.

78
00:06:28.390 --> 00:06:32.300
And I will show you then to use it as well.

79
00:06:32.350 --> 00:06:41.830
And over here you will find these CCAR accreditation IRS certification tests as well as you can see

80
00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:47.800
you can just use this code in order to freely access your tests.

81
00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:52.430
Over here of course you have to use your own code not mine.

82
00:06:53.140 --> 00:06:58.630
And in this case I will show you then to use all of those things.

83
00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.120
So let me open the course.

84
00:07:01.780 --> 00:07:12.270
And after you finish swift learning phase in the intermediate swift section in the section aids when

85
00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:18.280
you complete this section you will see these CCAR sweep level 1 certification.

86
00:07:18.280 --> 00:07:26.980
So when you come over here to 19th lecture you can just click here to reach the service level 1 tests

87
00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:31.760
and you don't have to do that when you first start the course.

88
00:07:31.780 --> 00:07:32.480
OK.

89
00:07:32.530 --> 00:07:41.800
You will see it then you actually finish the necessary steps necessary sections before you learn about

90
00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:42.220
Swift.

91
00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:48.120
There is no point to take this test because you won't be able to complete this test.

92
00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:51.050
It's not that hard but it's not a piece of cake.

93
00:07:51.070 --> 00:07:58.230
So you have to comprehend the essentials of swift programming language before you take this test.

94
00:07:58.300 --> 00:08:07.240
So I will just guide you to this cause when you take this certification when you reach here you can

95
00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:15.290
just go back to your eco Web hosting account and find your code and use it in your CCAR.

96
00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:23.630
And after you complete the advance section of Swift I believe it's Section 17 Yep after you complete.

97
00:08:23.650 --> 00:08:32.800
You can take the swift level to certification and you will use the exact same code one more time and

98
00:08:33.490 --> 00:08:42.010
then you complete most of the sections you will find a section called How to make money from your app

99
00:08:42.670 --> 00:08:46.960
and some way to do that is to market your app.

100
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:52.790
So there is a section dedicated to how to make a website for your app.

101
00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:58.620
So in order to make a website you will have to find and help find a hosting.

102
00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.300
OK.

103
00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:04.780
So you will find a place to host your Web site in the section 24.

104
00:09:04.780 --> 00:09:10.510
You can come back to your Ecolab posting to use your free hosting.

105
00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:11.880
OK.

106
00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:18.520
And for the graphical assets we have some dedicated design sections.

107
00:09:18.520 --> 00:09:23.800
So it's the last sections introduction to design and design practice.

108
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:29.710
So we use free softwares in order to learn these design essentials.

109
00:09:29.790 --> 00:09:30.500
OK.

110
00:09:30.730 --> 00:09:39.160
So in the sections you can use this graphical assets or in any time actually if you need icons or any

111
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:46.650
other graphical assets you can just download it from here and try to make use of them.

112
00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:53.950
So after you sign up to these Ecolab posting then you're ready to go you're all set up.

113
00:09:53.950 --> 00:09:58.300
Now let's start and build some real IRS apps.
