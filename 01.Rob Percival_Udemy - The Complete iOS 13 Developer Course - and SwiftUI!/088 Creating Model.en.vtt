00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.230
Hi.

2
00:00:01.350 --> 00:00:05.500
We didn't this lecture we going to write our Simpson class.

3
00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:12.210
We're going to create the Simpson model in which we will have all the information that we need regarding

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.830
to those Simpson's.

5
00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:21.090
So in order to do that of course I'm going to create a new that swift file and I'm going to write my

6
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:28.890
class inside of that swift file so that we can create some objects from that model and we can display

7
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:31.880
them in our table view eventually.

8
00:00:32.880 --> 00:00:35.410
So you know how to do that right.

9
00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:37.470
Maybe you can try to do it on your own.

10
00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:42.320
This is going to be exactly the same thing that we have done with the musician class.

11
00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:50.430
So I suggest you pose the video and try to create your own Simpson class.

12
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:55.100
I hope you manage to make it so let's do it together.

13
00:00:55.110 --> 00:01:01.110
I'm going to create a swift file over here and I'm going to name it Simpson.

14
00:01:01.510 --> 00:01:04.320
OK so that's it.

15
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:07.730
So this is going to be exactly the same as before.

16
00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:15.360
I'm going to go for class and this will be a class of Simpson and open that curly braces in which I

17
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.100
will have some properties.

18
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.710
So first purple property will be name.

19
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:28.260
So I'm going to initialize this to be an empty string and then a job and we're going to have an image

20
00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:28.850
right.

21
00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:33.300
So this is going to be a UI image as before.

22
00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:43.950
So maybe you got stuck here somehow because we cannot call this UI image inside of our class because

23
00:01:43.950 --> 00:01:48.140
we don't have the necessary library in order to call this.

24
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:56.070
We just have this import Foundation in here and this won't do the work rather than imparting the foundation

25
00:01:56.340 --> 00:01:59.070
we have to import the UI kit.

26
00:01:59.190 --> 00:02:06.060
Maybe you have understood that you have to import this library If so congratulations.

27
00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:09.270
As you can see I can call the UI image over here.

28
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:15.690
So rather than saying just import foundation I'm going to have to import the UI kit here as well in

29
00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:18.280
order to call this.

30
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:25.170
So again we have some different libraries we don't call everything at once.

31
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:29.700
So if we need something like that we can import whenever we need it.

32
00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:32.840
So next thing what do we need.

33
00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:38.140
We need to create those Homer objects or other objects right.

34
00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:44.040
So let me write Simpson class or Simpson objects in the weave debt load.

35
00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:51.420
We can come over here and we can create the Simpson object and we can actually make it work by giving

36
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.730
all the values that we want.

37
00:02:53.730 --> 00:03:01.500
So for example I can say let Homer and this is going to be a Simpson object and I can go over and say

38
00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:04.470
Homer dog name is Homer OK.

39
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:12.960
And we can go for Homer dot job I believe his job is nuclear safety inspector or something.

40
00:03:13.230 --> 00:03:16.940
And the Homer image you I image name.

41
00:03:16.950 --> 00:03:24.380
Let me open the parentheses find names and the name of that image is Homer.

42
00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.640
So this is asking for a string.

43
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:30.510
So this is Homer and this will be fine.

44
00:03:31.470 --> 00:03:37.180
And this is actually wanting us to force our rep this and that's OK.

45
00:03:37.190 --> 00:03:44.700
Because we know Homer dot P and your Homer dog J.P. actually exists in our assets folder.

46
00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:48.120
So we are certain that this is going to be work.

47
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:50.510
And this is fine.

48
00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.250
We can't we can actually do that.

49
00:03:53.340 --> 00:03:56.070
But I don't want to do that this way.

50
00:03:56.070 --> 00:04:02.000
This will be too difficult for me to do this for every object.

51
00:04:02.040 --> 00:04:09.450
Instead I just want to go over and create those without initializing the values.

52
00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:13.080
And I'm just going to assign those values in a constructor.

53
00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:16.440
Okay so name will be string.

54
00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:20.190
Job will be a string image will be a UI image.

55
00:04:20.190 --> 00:04:28.070
That's why I'm doing that in case of missing an age or in case of forgetting your value.

56
00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:30.370
So this is much more safer.

57
00:04:30.390 --> 00:04:32.090
Remember how we do that.

58
00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:36.680
We can use spatial function called in it.

59
00:04:36.690 --> 00:04:37.310
Right.

60
00:04:37.320 --> 00:04:45.810
So this is an initialized declaration and inside of this I I can write whatever I want to do when an

61
00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:49.130
object is created out of this class.

62
00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:54.740
So I'm going to ask for a Simpson name and this will be a simple string and the Simpson job.

63
00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:03.420
This will be again a string and as Simpson image this will be a you I image so I can come over here

64
00:05:03.420 --> 00:05:05.940
and say name is Simpson's name.

65
00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.940
OK.

66
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:09.660
Job is Simpson job.

67
00:05:09.690 --> 00:05:14.620
And the image is also as Simpson image.

68
00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:18.660
So does the Simpson image.

69
00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:22.230
So let me do a comment B and see if there's something wrong.

70
00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.840
Yeah I misspelled the image.

71
00:05:24.990 --> 00:05:28.450
So this is working right now right.

72
00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:35.940
I can create ad new object from the Simpson class using this initial laser and I believe this is much

73
00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:39.570
more better than what we have done previously.

74
00:05:39.570 --> 00:05:47.160
So we're going to use this class and this will be happening whenever I create a new object of Simpson

75
00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:49.150
class.

76
00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:51.690
So let's go ahead and try this.

77
00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:58.560
So let me go to we've controller and let me delete everything in here because we're going to do the

78
00:05:58.560 --> 00:05:59.150
same thing.

79
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:06.360
But right now this will give me an error if I do comment B as you can see and this won't even make sense.

80
00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.730
So let me write it from the beginning.

81
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:16.080
So Simpson opened parentheses and it will ask me for some parameters parameters that we have defined

82
00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:17.670
as an initial laser.

83
00:06:17.700 --> 00:06:23.340
So for name I'm going to go for Homer Simpson for job nuclear safety.

84
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:28.490
And Simpson image is going to be a you eye image open parentheses.

85
00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:38.400
Find the names and just say Homer here and with an exclamation point I believe in here and this is going

86
00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:40.470
to be OK right.

87
00:06:40.470 --> 00:06:43.620
This is much more safer in the previous way.

88
00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:52.400
We could have just forgotten about the Simpson job for example and this will bring us some problems.

89
00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:58.530
So here this is giving me some error Bart Simpson name is already there so I'm going to go for a comment

90
00:06:58.540 --> 00:06:59.370
B.

91
00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.900
And now this is OK.

92
00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:07.190
So this is giving me some errors saying that you have created Homer but you haven't used it.

93
00:07:07.210 --> 00:07:08.160
We're going to use it.

94
00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:09.080
Don't worry.

95
00:07:09.210 --> 00:07:15.810
So let's go and copy and paste this for a few times because we're going to create other objects as well.

96
00:07:16.770 --> 00:07:18.870
So let's do this fast.

97
00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:27.270
This is going to be Marge Marge Simpson Simpson job I believe she's not working right so she's going

98
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:30.610
to be a housewife if not my bad.

99
00:07:30.630 --> 00:07:32.190
I really don't know.

100
00:07:32.190 --> 00:07:36.810
So this is March and let's go for Bart.

101
00:07:36.810 --> 00:07:38.290
So Bart Simpson.

102
00:07:38.340 --> 00:07:44.520
Simpson job is student you are image name is Bart.

103
00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:46.710
So let me go to fourth one.

104
00:07:46.710 --> 00:07:51.510
So this is going to be Lisa and Lisa Simpson.

105
00:07:51.510 --> 00:07:52.630
Simpson job.

106
00:07:52.630 --> 00:07:57.960
She's a student as well and much better than Bart as far as I remember.

107
00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.160
So let's go for Maggie and Simpson name is Maggie.

108
00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:06.500
So her name was Margaret Maggie.

109
00:08:06.510 --> 00:08:07.300
OK.

110
00:08:07.470 --> 00:08:08.170
And job.

111
00:08:08.250 --> 00:08:12.930
Let's say baby and the UI images Maggie.

112
00:08:13.710 --> 00:08:17.010
So that's all that's all we have to do.

113
00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:17.860
Right.

114
00:08:17.880 --> 00:08:22.190
We have created our model objects and let's check the names.

115
00:08:22.190 --> 00:08:22.410
Yeah.

116
00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.630
Homer Lisa Maggie March.

117
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:32.040
So we're getting some warning saying that you have created all of these objects but you haven't actually

118
00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:33.240
used them.

119
00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:40.620
We're going to use them let's create a homer array in which we will have this Homer objects so you can

120
00:08:40.950 --> 00:08:49.020
create an array like this and just say Homer March Bart Lisa and Maggie.

121
00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:56.840
So this will be an array of Homer Simpson not Homer Simpson Bart Simpson objects.

122
00:08:56.850 --> 00:08:57.510
OK.

123
00:08:57.550 --> 00:09:05.290
Regarding to use leverage disarray in order to display those values in our table view.

124
00:09:05.370 --> 00:09:08.250
So let's do that within the next lecture.
