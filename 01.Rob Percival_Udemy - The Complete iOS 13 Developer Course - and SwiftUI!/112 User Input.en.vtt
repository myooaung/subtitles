Hi.

2
00:00:01.870 --> 00:00:08.440
We didn't like Jerry going to start creating the actual user interface for our tribal books so I'm going

3
00:00:08.440 --> 00:00:15.940
to add two text fields in here so that the user can give input for the name of the place and their note

4
00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.620
or comment off the place.

5
00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:23.050
OK so where are you going to get those name and comment from the user and we're going to display them

6
00:00:23.140 --> 00:00:26.590
in the annotation that we have been creating so far.

7
00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:35.230
So let's go to main that sorry Bart and as you can see the map is stretched all the way to the edges.

8
00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:42.000
I'm going to make this one a little bit shorter so we can place the text fields on a bell of the map.

9
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:48.790
K so let's call for attacks field drag and drop to here and let's make it.

10
00:00:48.820 --> 00:00:52.510
Let's zoom in in a little bit so that we can see better.

11
00:00:52.510 --> 00:00:58.140
So let's make this a little bit bigger too and put it in the center of this view controller.

12
00:00:58.150 --> 00:00:58.880
OK.

13
00:00:59.110 --> 00:01:05.260
So once more let's go to place holder and say name not name name.

14
00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.570
Yeah this one and copy and paste this with comments see and comment V.

15
00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:17.330
Next thing will be not name but comments or you can just say something like note as well.

16
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:25.690
So this is where user will give the input of name and comments and we have to make sure that we update

17
00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:28.660
the constraints we give the constraints one more time.

18
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:36.390
So this text field and map can actually leave them together in a very structured way.

19
00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:43.050
So let's define this text fields into the coding area out to fix this map here.

20
00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:50.110
Once you see these orange lines over in the constraints it means that there is something wrong.

21
00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:53.560
It gets updated but you didn't update the constraints.

22
00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:00.760
OK so in order to overcome this problem if you see something with an orange you have to make sure you

23
00:02:01.180 --> 00:02:09.190
come over here and say update constraint constants and it updates these constraints but it doesn't give

24
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.010
the constraints to neatly added views.

25
00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:18.790
So I'm going to come over here one more time and say reset to suggested constraints then they will all

26
00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:21.670
have constraints as I wanted to be.

27
00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:30.100
So let me open and the view controller Assistant Editor we're here and we don't have the name tax and

28
00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:30.850
command tag.

29
00:02:30.850 --> 00:02:38.900
So let me go abo and in here after my class let me bring in my name text.

30
00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:39.320
OK.

31
00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:41.840
So this is going to be the name text.

32
00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.460
And again this is going to be my comment text.

33
00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:48.850
So this is comments text.

34
00:02:48.850 --> 00:02:49.600
Here you go.

35
00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:50.550
I've defined them.

36
00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:52.960
I have already defined Matthew before.

37
00:02:53.350 --> 00:03:00.880
So if I go to view controller I can come over here to annotation title and delete this new annotation

38
00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:07.380
and rather I can just come over here and say name taxed dot text OK.

39
00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:16.060
And I believe we can only doing does force on rap thing because it's going to take whatever we want

40
00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:17.170
from here.

41
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:20.880
We are not converting ts to be an integer or something.

42
00:03:20.890 --> 00:03:23.690
So in the subtitle we're just going to say come on.

43
00:03:23.700 --> 00:03:25.130
Text out texts.

44
00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:32.890
So let's try if this works it will bring the name input and comment input from the user to the title

45
00:03:32.890 --> 00:03:35.490
and subtitle of the annotation.

46
00:03:35.530 --> 00:03:43.140
So first we have to write the inputs OK for name I'm going to say April tower and four commands.

47
00:03:43.150 --> 00:03:45.350
Let's say I love Paris.

48
00:03:45.430 --> 00:03:45.830
OK.

49
00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:53.550
And then if I click over here for three seconds and hold as you can see it says that Eiffel Tower and

50
00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:57.040
if I click on that we can see the subtitle as well.

51
00:03:57.040 --> 00:03:58.110
I love Paris.

52
00:03:58.390 --> 00:04:05.680
So it's works done only thing left to do is just take all of those information from here including the

53
00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:11.380
latitude and longitude and save them into the car data database.

54
00:04:11.380 --> 00:04:15.700
And luckily we have learned how to do that in the previous section.

55
00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:21.550
So I'm going to stop here and within the next section we're going to add an even save bottom to here

56
00:04:21.790 --> 00:04:27.040
and then we click on that say by then we're going to take all of this information and save them into

57
00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:28.150
the database.
