00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:07,170
Hi we didn't this lecture we going to retrieve our information and save them into a model so that we

2
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,120
can display them in the table view.

3
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:15,600
So in order to do that I'm going to come over here to our models folder and I'm going to create a new

4
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:21,520
file and this will be as swift file because we're going to only have one struct.

5
00:00:21,710 --> 00:00:22,430
OK.

6
00:00:22,650 --> 00:00:28,360
So for our model name I'm just going to call the snap any side of the snap.

7
00:00:28,350 --> 00:00:32,250
We're going to have a struct cold snap as well.

8
00:00:32,250 --> 00:00:37,590
So in this model I'm only going to have three variables for right now.

9
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:43,830
So what I'm going to have is the snap or the user name of the snap owner.

10
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:51,330
OK so I'm going to call this user name not the user e-mail actually I'm going to go for a user name.

11
00:00:51,330 --> 00:00:52,120
So.

12
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:57,810
And again we're going to have an image URL erased not an image URL string.

13
00:00:58,220 --> 00:00:58,640
OK.

14
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:04,050
And we're going to have a date and this will have the type of date as well.

15
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,580
So as you can see we have three variables but three different types.

16
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,150
So that's good for practice right.

17
00:01:11,160 --> 00:01:15,440
We're going to use this model to save our information.

18
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:22,680
So each time we get the new document we're going to create as snap objects out of that document.

19
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:24,710
So let's see how this works.

20
00:01:24,810 --> 00:01:30,070
I'm going to check to see if I can get the user name first.

21
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:37,320
So I'm going to say document that gets and devalue the field actually that I'm looking for is the snap

22
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:38,850
owner remember.

23
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:40,050
Right.

24
00:01:40,110 --> 00:01:46,380
So maybe you can use some more consistent names like if you're calling this snap or winner you can call

25
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:49,500
the snap owner in the model as well.

26
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:58,590
So let me come over here and check for image URL all airy and this will be documents dot document dot

27
00:01:58,650 --> 00:01:59,430
yet.

28
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:00,180
OK.

29
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:04,060
And the value that we are looking for is the image you're all airy.

30
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:07,930
So it has to be spelled exactly like this image earlier.

31
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,560
And I'm going to optionally cast this to be as an array of strings.

32
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:21,360
And finally I'm going to get this date and this will be document that get and devalue that I'm looking

33
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,430
for is date and I'm going to cast is as timestamp.

34
00:02:25,500 --> 00:02:30,720
We cannot cast is as date I'm going to show we have to do that later on.

35
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:32,050
OK.

36
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:35,850
Now we have all the values that we need.

37
00:02:35,970 --> 00:02:40,090
We can use our snap model to create our first step.

38
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:41,150
Right.

39
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:42,690
So that's what we're going to do.

40
00:02:42,750 --> 00:02:45,020
I'm going to call this snap Ok.

41
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:47,580
And this will be a snap object.

42
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,690
So right snap over here and it will give you the initial visor.

43
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:56,470
So it will ask you for a user name and image URL array and that date.

44
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:01,920
So user name is the user name imager I'll erase the image you're all right.

45
00:03:02,010 --> 00:03:05,430
And date we have to convert this to be a date.

46
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,050
And it's very easy you can just say date that date value.

47
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,180
So this converts timestamp to be a date.

48
00:03:14,190 --> 00:03:18,500
And here we are here we have our first snap.

49
00:03:18,570 --> 00:03:27,090
Now we have to make sure that we have a snap array or here so that we can display our snaps in our table

50
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:27,510
view.

51
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,500
So I'm going to call the snap array and this will have the object of snaps right.

52
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:34,560
So that's it.

53
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:36,580
So let me delete this dot.

54
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,210
So come over here and add this to our snap array.

55
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:49,410
So soft dot snap or a dot that pens and we're gonna append the snap and remember in situations like

56
00:03:49,410 --> 00:03:56,330
this in order to prevent duplication of values we have to come over here and clear all the values from

57
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:01,530
SNAP array so you can just say remove all keeping capacity falls.

58
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:02,960
And here you go.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:06,540
Now let's come over here and connect this to our table view.

60
00:04:06,690 --> 00:04:09,790
Say return snap or eight that count.

61
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,400
And over here in the Feed the user name label.

62
00:04:13,560 --> 00:04:18,130
I'm going to take snap array index Pat throw.

63
00:04:18,150 --> 00:04:26,940
So this will give me the snap object itself but I just want to get the name of that snap object so you

64
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:33,000
can just say data user name Alf Gergiev are you going to have to do that for Image view as well.

65
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,280
But right now we don't have necessary tools to go with that.

66
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:44,400
So later on I'm going to take care of this for right now we have another problem because we have to

67
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,810
check to see if 24 hours is passed or not.

68
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:52,620
So I'm going to do it like this if 24 hours is passed.

69
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:59,280
I'm just going to delete the data from five star since now I have the data over here.

70
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:01,570
I can't easily check that.

71
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:02,540
OK.

72
00:05:02,740 --> 00:05:04,630
And there is a method to do that.

73
00:05:04,660 --> 00:05:05,280
In Swift.

74
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,960
So I'm going to show you how this works so I'm going to create a difference and this will be the difference

75
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:13,710
between my date and current date.

76
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,380
So I'm going to use calendar in order to do that as you can see this is the relationship manager between

77
00:05:20,380 --> 00:05:29,110
calendar units so you can use this to understand the difference between your date and the current date

78
00:05:29,710 --> 00:05:30,970
in order to do that.

79
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:33,400
You have to say calendar that's current.

80
00:05:33,430 --> 00:05:36,060
So this is the user's current calendar.

81
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:41,650
And over here you have to go for date complements.

82
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:43,430
OK this one.

83
00:05:43,660 --> 00:05:46,930
So this will ask you for the compliment of the date.

84
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:54,220
Like I if you want to get an hour or if you want to compare the months or years and it will ask you

85
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:58,630
to parameters which dates you want to compare.

86
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:06,340
So I believe that's not the one we want because it only has one parameter so let me write dates complement

87
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:08,140
one more time.

88
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:16,000
And yep we want this one competence from and to so we have to have two date variables over here.

89
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:18,430
So make sure you choose this one.

90
00:06:18,570 --> 00:06:19,340
Okay.

91
00:06:19,450 --> 00:06:27,300
So we're going to specify the dates on there does from end to values and in the competence we're going

92
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:35,480
to go for our okay because we want to see if we can get 24 hours out of that one.

93
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:43,650
So you add to you date in here from okay in the from parameter and of course you have to say date that

94
00:06:43,660 --> 00:06:50,840
date value in order to get the date and you can just say dates over here to get the current dates.

95
00:06:50,920 --> 00:06:58,120
Once you do that you have to say dot our to get ours out of that function.

96
00:06:58,550 --> 00:06:59,010
OK.

97
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:06,590
So this will give you an integer indicating the difference between two dates as an hour.

98
00:07:06,630 --> 00:07:14,300
Again we're comparing the dates value with current date to get our values out of that one.

99
00:07:14,320 --> 00:07:14,970
Okay.

100
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:20,340
And we're going to check to see if this difference is actually more than 24 hours.

101
00:07:20,860 --> 00:07:30,340
So if difference is more than 24 hours actually greater than or equal to 24 hours then going to just

102
00:07:30,340 --> 00:07:31,840
delete this document.

103
00:07:31,870 --> 00:07:32,310
Right.

104
00:07:32,320 --> 00:07:38,800
So I'm going to delete and if that's not the case I'm not going to do anything actually but I'm just

105
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,570
going to pass this information to another we have controller.

106
00:07:43,660 --> 00:07:45,650
So let me delete this.

107
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:50,830
So I'm going to say self-styled fire's star database that's collection.

108
00:07:50,830 --> 00:07:57,140
So this will be the snaps collection and we will need the documents I.D. or here.

109
00:07:57,160 --> 00:08:05,480
So let me create this document I.D. I'm going to say document I.D. is document that document I.D. And

110
00:08:05,470 --> 00:08:10,390
we are going to say that document to reach the specific document I.D..

111
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:17,220
And after that you can just say dot delete and this will give you a completion block.

112
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,350
You can see if there is any error messages as well.

113
00:08:21,010 --> 00:08:30,220
So you can just go for air and you can just do something like printing out the air if you want and if

114
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:37,510
that's not the case if difference is not greater than 24 hours then I'm not going to do anything.

115
00:08:38,050 --> 00:08:44,190
So I'm just going to pass this information to every snap the controller because remember that's where

116
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,020
we display the time left.

117
00:08:47,020 --> 00:08:53,890
So in snap your controller users will see the time left to deletion.

118
00:08:53,890 --> 00:09:00,280
So we're going to pass this information to snappy controller I'm just taking notes so that we won't

119
00:09:00,280 --> 00:09:02,170
forget about this.

120
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:09,580
And the other thing not to forget is to display the image inside of our table view as well.

121
00:09:09,610 --> 00:09:14,640
So in order to do that we're going to work with SD rep image like we did before.

122
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,540
Let's do that in the next lecture.
