00:00:00,620 --> 00:00:01,190
Hi.

2
00:00:01,270 --> 00:00:02,310
We did this lecture.

3
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:07,120
We're going to learn how to upload the chosen image from the upload.

4
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:10,580
We have comptroller to the storage of the fire base.

5
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:17,210
So far we have created this user interface so that we can go to the gallery and get the image back.

6
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,960
And we have to upload it to the storage and then to the database as well so that we can retrieve those

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,430
data and show them to the user.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:37,290
And remember we use storage to store the media like image like videos and we use database to store the

9
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:46,180
data like a day commands or who uploaded this picture or do you roll of the stored image every again

10
00:00:46,190 --> 00:00:53,110
and learn how to do that so that we can get those back and display them into the feed of the user.

11
00:00:53,130 --> 00:01:02,190
OK the first thing to learn is actually how to upload the image to the storage so that we can get the

12
00:01:02,190 --> 00:01:06,260
uploaded the euro and save it to the database.

13
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:13,230
And again like we did in the authentication we have to initialize this storage as well and we're going

14
00:01:13,230 --> 00:01:14,850
to do that in the database.

15
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,490
And we're doing this only for once remember we have to initialize this.

16
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,420
After that we can use it as we want.

17
00:01:23,730 --> 00:01:29,070
We can set up some security rules in the database and storage as well.

18
00:01:29,160 --> 00:01:36,270
At the end of this section we're going to take a deeper look at in the security rules as well.

19
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:43,860
But for right now we're going to start as in the default mode so that we can write and read data from

20
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:44,680
the storage.

21
00:01:45,090 --> 00:01:51,000
So if you click on this get started by then you will see the security rules of the cloud search.

22
00:01:51,720 --> 00:01:57,850
So what we have here is defining who can read and who can write to the storage.

23
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,130
And as you can see says that yeah we a low return right.

24
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:08,720
If only and only if the request is authenticated.

25
00:02:08,790 --> 00:02:09,110
OK.

26
00:02:09,150 --> 00:02:15,070
So if a user gets authentication as in they can sign up and sign.

27
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:23,400
And so then after they can actually upload data or download data from the search and in fact that's

28
00:02:23,400 --> 00:02:27,110
what we want to make our app more secure.

29
00:02:27,270 --> 00:02:32,720
And we're going to implement in implement this in our database as well.

30
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,210
At the end of this course.

31
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:40,260
But this is a default behavior for our storage as usual.

32
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,370
So that's what I want.

33
00:02:42,450 --> 00:02:49,130
I wants people to access my surge as long as they are authenticate it so I'm going to hit next.

34
00:02:49,410 --> 00:02:56,000
And next thing it will ask me for to choose a location for my cloud search.

35
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:03,300
And here you can see we have Europe U.S. Asia North America and other locations.

36
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:12,230
So it really doesn't matter which you choose you can just access your data in any location you want

37
00:03:12,240 --> 00:03:19,380
but if you're focusing on a U.S. market for example you can choose one of the U.S. market locations

38
00:03:19,380 --> 00:03:26,040
or if you're focusing on Europe in your app if you're targeting Europe users you have to choose Europe

39
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:32,040
in order to make your storage in order to make your database act faster.

40
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:39,060
And by the way it won't affect too much maybe you're going to do curries in one seconds if you don't

41
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,700
pay attention to this location.

42
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,630
But if you pay attention maybe it's going to be less than one second.

43
00:03:45,630 --> 00:03:53,400
But I eventually I believe you have to choose your location with careful decisions because you cannot

44
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,570
change this after you choose.

45
00:03:55,590 --> 00:03:56,400
Okay.

46
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:03,180
Wherever you choose it will be state as your main location for your search and for your database as

47
00:04:03,180 --> 00:04:04,260
well.

48
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:10,860
So if you're targeting all the world then just choose one of the locations like Europe or U.S. and if

49
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:18,320
you're focusing on specific location like Asia or U.S. or Europe then choose your related one end of

50
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:26,520
hits next and it will create your storage for you and this location will be used as a default location

51
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:28,680
when we initialize database as well.

52
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:31,570
So they will be synchronized.

53
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:32,880
And here we go.

54
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,400
We have our storage created.

55
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:42,990
So far we don't have anything in our storage as you can see we can manually add some folders from here

56
00:04:42,990 --> 00:04:50,070
like if you click on this plus button you can call this media or you can call us images videos whatever

57
00:04:50,070 --> 00:04:58,500
you want You may not choose to create any folder like this at all but I'm going to create a media folder

58
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:04,890
and I'm going to store our images inside of this media folder in order to be more structured.

59
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:06,650
But it's not mandatory.

60
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:07,180
OK.

61
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,280
And it's not mandatory to do this from here.

62
00:05:10,310 --> 00:05:18,040
I'm gonna write a code for this later on and it's not mandatory to initialize this from this dashboard

63
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,670
is it.

64
00:05:18,770 --> 00:05:24,840
If you have created your storage if you have chosen your location then it's OK.

65
00:05:25,190 --> 00:05:32,760
So let's come back to our documentation and let's go for AOS as usual.

66
00:05:33,110 --> 00:05:37,160
And in here we have great documentation regarding the storage.

67
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:42,880
If you come over here to get started you can see the necessary paths.

68
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:45,560
We have actually done this before right.

69
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:46,870
We have added the pods.

70
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:56,380
And as you can see we have some sample codes regarding how to upload a file how to download that file

71
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:03,800
and don't worry I'm going to show all of this in the course but I really suggest you go back here and

72
00:06:04,370 --> 00:06:11,680
just read those documentation if you have time because in firebase has so many modules so many methods

73
00:06:11,750 --> 00:06:20,150
so many functions we cannot go over them one by one but I'm just showing you the most used ones most

74
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:27,140
used operations but there are some details that may come in handy when you're developing an app with

75
00:06:27,140 --> 00:06:28,330
freebase.

76
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:31,700
So I suggest you take a look around here.

77
00:06:31,700 --> 00:06:37,970
So as you can see we have an example here we are creating a reference from storage that's storage and

78
00:06:37,970 --> 00:06:46,640
we're selecting a child's name for our folders and we're creating some other references to upload and

79
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:48,230
download images.

80
00:06:48,590 --> 00:06:49,610
We're going to do that.

81
00:06:49,610 --> 00:06:50,400
Don't worry.

82
00:06:50,420 --> 00:06:54,100
But I believe the documentation of the firebase is great.

83
00:06:54,590 --> 00:07:02,210
So when a user clicks on this upload button we have to upload the image to the storage first.

84
00:07:02,210 --> 00:07:10,340
So let me grab firebase library from here and then we can create this storage reference that has been

85
00:07:10,340 --> 00:07:12,700
mentioned in the documentation as well.

86
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,900
So I'm going to call this storage and this will drive from the storage class of the fire base.

87
00:07:17,900 --> 00:07:18,320
OK.

88
00:07:18,320 --> 00:07:20,890
This the capitalized s storage.

89
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:25,850
And as you can see this is a service that supports uploading and downloading objects.

90
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:28,820
So this is exactly what we did in yards.

91
00:07:28,940 --> 00:07:31,280
So storage dot storage.

92
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:31,640
OK.

93
00:07:31,640 --> 00:07:36,470
So this will create a storage instance an instance of the storage class.

94
00:07:36,770 --> 00:07:44,060
And we are going to use that storage instance to create the references and upload images.

95
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:48,830
So next thing will be to create our storage reference.

96
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:49,630
OK.

97
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:51,860
And you can do that in one line as well.

98
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:57,220
I'm doing it on purpose so that you can understand the steps more clearly.

99
00:07:57,230 --> 00:08:03,830
So we're creating a surge instance and then we're creating a reference from that instance so that we

100
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:08,030
can use that reference to upload our image.

101
00:08:08,030 --> 00:08:11,050
So that's what we're going to do in the database as well.

102
00:08:11,250 --> 00:08:15,890
We're going to create a firestorm instance and a reference.

103
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,500
And let me create our media folder.

104
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:21,440
So that's the folder that I'm creating right now.

105
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:25,500
So if I see a storage reference dot Childs.

106
00:08:25,570 --> 00:08:26,320
OK.

107
00:08:26,360 --> 00:08:35,800
So whenever you see Dot Childs in far your basic means that we have to go one level below.

108
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:43,520
So if I had another folder inside of that media folder then I can say dot child media.

109
00:08:43,520 --> 00:08:45,980
That child something else.

110
00:08:45,980 --> 00:08:52,700
And now I mean the reference and I'm saying dot child to go one level below to media folder.

111
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:53,430
Ok.

112
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,930
So it will refer to my media folder if I say dot child media.

113
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:06,350
So again if I had another thing in here like images it will just create the images folder for me.

114
00:09:06,350 --> 00:09:13,390
You don't have to manually go and create that media folder but I'm going to go for the name media.

115
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:22,990
And again if you put another thing in here like dot child media too it will create another example another

116
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:26,100
folder inside of your media folder.

117
00:09:26,330 --> 00:09:32,280
Ok but I'm not going to do that because I only need one folder to say my images.

118
00:09:32,810 --> 00:09:41,610
So let's upload our image right in order to upload our image we have to convert it into a data.

119
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:46,190
Remember what we did in the art book we just don't save images.

120
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:55,310
As a UI image to a server or a database we have to create the images to a data type so that we can get

121
00:09:55,310 --> 00:09:58,220
them and upload them after downloading them.

122
00:09:58,220 --> 00:10:03,670
We can also convert back to the UI image and we know how to do that.

123
00:10:03,930 --> 00:10:11,160
So that's exactly what we're going to do in here as well in order to get our chosen image and compress

124
00:10:11,160 --> 00:10:18,930
it and change it to a J pad data and just save it to the database or storage.

125
00:10:18,930 --> 00:10:27,180
So remember I would do that if that data image view that image that J page data and it asks us for a

126
00:10:27,180 --> 00:10:34,140
compression quality we have gun words O point five I believe and that was OK.

127
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:36,720
So I'm going to go four point five again.

128
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:44,730
So maybe you can try something like open three or point four to just work with some lower resolutions

129
00:10:44,730 --> 00:10:45,240
as well.

130
00:10:46,420 --> 00:10:52,720
And in here we are agreeing to say late let's media reference.

131
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:53,100
OK.

132
00:10:53,110 --> 00:10:59,200
I'm creating a reference for my image right now not my media folder.

133
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:04,580
And it's going to be driving from the media folder dubbed child.

134
00:11:04,600 --> 00:11:12,840
So whatever I give as a name here like in image that J pack it will save my image like that.

135
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:13,180
OK.

136
00:11:13,190 --> 00:11:20,360
It will just rename my image like image that J again they'll save it to the storage.

137
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:27,490
And I believe this media reference is not a good name because we're creating air for us not for our

138
00:11:27,850 --> 00:11:34,030
Media folder we're creating this reference for our media image.

139
00:11:34,030 --> 00:11:34,490
OK.

140
00:11:34,870 --> 00:11:38,800
So we are creating this for image here for us.

141
00:11:38,830 --> 00:11:41,120
So I believe we should rename this.

142
00:11:41,140 --> 00:11:44,950
So let me call this image here for this rather than media for.

143
00:11:44,980 --> 00:11:45,280
OK.

144
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:53,100
So that you can understand it better and then I'm going to say image reference that put data.

145
00:11:53,140 --> 00:11:54,210
OK.

146
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:01,090
It'll ask me for a data to put on the storage and we have that data right.

147
00:12:01,210 --> 00:12:04,840
And we want with the completion block OK.

148
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,220
Because we want to check if we have any error.

149
00:12:08,230 --> 00:12:17,020
If we manage to upload the folder managed to upload the file to the folder so that we can get back animator

150
00:12:17,020 --> 00:12:21,650
data that we want so data is data.

151
00:12:21,970 --> 00:12:29,320
Meta data is kind of a description that we want to send with the image and we don't need one in here.

152
00:12:29,350 --> 00:12:29,800
OK.

153
00:12:29,800 --> 00:12:36,130
So I'm going to go for Neil and completion is our regular completion callback function.

154
00:12:36,190 --> 00:12:41,530
If you hit enter it will give us a main meta data and we're going to need that.

155
00:12:41,530 --> 00:12:44,240
So I'm going to name this meta data.

156
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:46,600
And for error we're going to say error.

157
00:12:47,950 --> 00:12:55,450
So as usual I'm going to start by checking if error is not nil and if area is not nil you can just show

158
00:12:55,450 --> 00:12:57,930
an Ellard message to the user.

159
00:12:57,940 --> 00:13:05,530
I'm just going to go for a print error that localized description and in the else of course we want

160
00:13:05,530 --> 00:13:07,530
to do something right.

161
00:13:07,540 --> 00:13:13,010
We want to get the euro of the uploaded image.

162
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:14,620
Why do we even need that.

163
00:13:14,620 --> 00:13:22,990
Because we're going to save this euro to the database along with the other information like comment

164
00:13:23,080 --> 00:13:25,050
and who posted post over there.

165
00:13:25,090 --> 00:13:25,900
OK.

166
00:13:26,050 --> 00:13:27,820
Adds date.

167
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:37,430
So every image every past a in the database will have an image URL a comment and other features as well.

168
00:13:37,480 --> 00:13:43,460
And previously we had this by saying meta data that image euro.

169
00:13:43,690 --> 00:13:48,700
But right now as you can see this doesn't give us the image euro.

170
00:13:48,700 --> 00:13:50,730
You know here to get the image here.

171
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,240
Now we have to do something like image reference.

172
00:13:55,390 --> 00:14:03,330
OK dot download euro but only after you complete putting data you dude.

173
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:12,400
So after you are done in here then in the else block if there is not any error you can just call image

174
00:14:12,400 --> 00:14:14,550
reference that download the euro.

175
00:14:15,070 --> 00:14:21,340
And in this I'm gonna call these Euro and I'm going to call this error and this time I'm going to check

176
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:24,170
if error is actually Neil.

177
00:14:24,280 --> 00:14:25,020
OK.

178
00:14:25,060 --> 00:14:28,410
I'm not going to show any Alec messages in here.

179
00:14:28,510 --> 00:14:36,560
If the error is nil then I'm going to go for the URL so I can just call this image here.

180
00:14:36,610 --> 00:14:41,980
Let's image euro is going to be your URL that absolute strings.

181
00:14:41,980 --> 00:14:45,070
Look there there is an absolute euro as well.

182
00:14:45,070 --> 00:14:46,950
We're looking for absolute string.

183
00:14:46,960 --> 00:14:49,570
So pay attention here is string 1.

184
00:14:49,990 --> 00:14:52,110
So I'm going to print this string.

185
00:14:52,180 --> 00:14:52,560
OK.

186
00:14:52,570 --> 00:15:01,080
I'm going to print this image Euro to see if we really managed to upload the image to the storage.

187
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:09,010
So now we can't test is actually let's run this in our simulator and remember our simulator has some

188
00:15:09,010 --> 00:15:12,480
pre-built in images in their photo gallery.

189
00:15:12,550 --> 00:15:20,230
But I really such as you go and find your some images on your own because these images are too big and

190
00:15:20,230 --> 00:15:20,910
it will work.

191
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:27,530
It will get uploaded but I believe it's more realistic to work with an image like this.

192
00:15:27,610 --> 00:15:34,390
So as a comment it actually doesn't matter if I write a comment here or not because we're not doing

193
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:40,650
anything with that comment right now we're just uploading this image to these stories.

194
00:15:40,660 --> 00:15:49,630
So whatever you write here won't get attention by the tax code so just write something or just leave

195
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:50,860
it empty.

196
00:15:50,860 --> 00:15:57,790
All we have to do is just hit the upload button to see if we can manage to send this to the storage

197
00:15:58,300 --> 00:16:05,280
and once I hit the upload button as you can see in the lugs I get this year.

198
00:16:05,290 --> 00:16:08,950
I get this optional year out because this is optional right now.

199
00:16:09,070 --> 00:16:13,590
As you can see and we're going to take care of this later on.

200
00:16:13,840 --> 00:16:22,570
But for right now we have to take this euro and we can see if we really manage to upload our image to

201
00:16:22,570 --> 00:16:23,230
this euro.

202
00:16:23,260 --> 00:16:24,860
So let me copy this.

203
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:33,570
Let me open safari or any other browser and paste this in to see if we get the image.

204
00:16:33,580 --> 00:16:34,070
Yep.

205
00:16:34,090 --> 00:16:35,760
It asks for a download.

206
00:16:35,760 --> 00:16:37,690
Permission if I allow that.

207
00:16:37,690 --> 00:16:38,680
Here you go.

208
00:16:38,680 --> 00:16:42,280
We see the image as we have uploaded.

209
00:16:42,310 --> 00:16:50,110
So now I managed to upload my image to the fire base storage and in fact let's go back to our media

210
00:16:50,110 --> 00:16:51,740
folder in here.

211
00:16:51,790 --> 00:16:58,720
Right now we're going to see our image renamed as the image dot J back and in here as you can see we

212
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:06,850
have the file location the you're out here and we don't have any meta data because remember we actually

213
00:17:06,850 --> 00:17:14,920
chose this to be nil and if you want to save any description in here you can do that but we don't need

214
00:17:14,920 --> 00:17:16,720
that right now.

215
00:17:16,720 --> 00:17:18,860
So far so good.

216
00:17:18,910 --> 00:17:22,450
In fact we're not done with the whole uploading process.

217
00:17:22,460 --> 00:17:29,050
We're gonna encounter some issues because of the name of this image but we're going to take care of

218
00:17:29,050 --> 00:17:31,570
that one in the next lecture.
