00:00:00,690 --> 00:00:01,280
Hi.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:09,180
We didn't this lecture we going to finish our app by taking care of high scores storage right now we

3
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:12,160
don't have any high score check.

4
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:15,960
So we have to do that when the time ends.

5
00:00:15,990 --> 00:00:18,450
So I'm going to called is high score.

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,830
OK so that's where we're going to take care of this.

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:23,590
Why.

8
00:00:23,610 --> 00:00:25,010
Because let me see.

9
00:00:25,010 --> 00:00:31,770
We have a high score label here in which I want to show the highest score that has ever been made in

10
00:00:31,770 --> 00:00:32,400
this game.

11
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:40,650
So maybe you think that these we are going to do this with user defaults and that's correct because

12
00:00:40,650 --> 00:00:46,130
we're only going to save one little value and that's the perfect way to do it.

13
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:46,650
Right.

14
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:53,910
So are we going to control if score is higher than the high score his current score is actually higher

15
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:59,770
than the high score that I'm going to save this new score as a high score.

16
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:04,800
If it's not then I'm not going to change high score at all.

17
00:01:04,890 --> 00:01:07,760
So this is how it's going to go down.

18
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:16,950
We're going to check to see if our score is actually higher than the highest previous score and in the

19
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,030
we did load of course we're going to check to see if we have scored any high score.

20
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,090
And we're going to take it and show it in our high score label.

21
00:01:27,090 --> 00:01:31,460
So we need a high score variable in order to do that right.

22
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:38,370
So I'm going to save our high score zero and we're going to take this from the reloaded load from the

23
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:39,330
user default.

24
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:48,450
So it's actually easy to assign this to be zero initially and then we can check to see if we have any

25
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:51,250
other scores could start.

26
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:57,020
So when the time ends I'm going to check to see if self-doubt score is.

27
00:01:57,120 --> 00:02:01,440
I actually hired Dan self-taught high score.

28
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:02,170
Right.

29
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:11,590
So if that's the case then I'm going to need to just start this valley as a high score.

30
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:19,200
So first of all I'm going to make sure that my high score in teacher myself that high scoring teacher

31
00:02:19,620 --> 00:02:21,810
is now self-taught score.

32
00:02:22,470 --> 00:02:31,590
So this will be updated but also I'm going to make sure that I I'm saving this high score real inside

33
00:02:31,590 --> 00:02:42,320
of my user default database so you can just go and say high score labeled text is now High Score Column.

34
00:02:42,320 --> 00:02:42,680
OK.

35
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:50,500
High Score Column A rear slash high score so or self-doubt high score.

36
00:02:51,030 --> 00:02:51,350
Yeah.

37
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:53,760
So this is good right.

38
00:02:53,760 --> 00:03:02,880
This will display this high score real to the user but also we want to store it so that we won't lose

39
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,850
it once the user closes down the game.

40
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,440
So user defaults dot standard that set.

41
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:11,180
You remember how this works.

42
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,580
You how to come up with a value and with a key.

43
00:03:14,970 --> 00:03:22,020
So our rally is simple here self-taught high score OK because we already said it to be the highest score

44
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:25,760
and therefore key I'm going to use high score again.

45
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:29,400
But we can call it anything we want.

46
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:36,060
So I'm going to go for high score and we need to remember this key because we're going to need it in

47
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:37,790
a minute.

48
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:39,300
So far so good.

49
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:44,730
Let's go to we did loads in the we did load we have to check for high score as well.

50
00:03:44,730 --> 00:03:45,340
Right.

51
00:03:45,420 --> 00:03:52,290
Because there will be some cases that we store the high score and there will be other cases we didn't

52
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:59,370
score the high score for example for the first time a user opens this game there won't be any high scores

53
00:03:59,370 --> 00:04:00,460
saved.

54
00:04:00,690 --> 00:04:07,770
So I'm going to say let's start high score and I'm going to get this value from user defaults that sender

55
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:14,400
that objects and for key of course I'm going to use the same key that I have stated.

56
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:21,830
So this is high score and I'm going to check to see if this value exists or not.

57
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:26,440
So I can come over here and just say if start high score is nil.

58
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:27,530
Right.

59
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:32,130
So if that's the case then it means that I didn't start anything.

60
00:04:33,090 --> 00:04:37,880
So I can just show high score as zero.

61
00:04:37,890 --> 00:04:38,790
Right.

62
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:49,210
I can say high score is zero and high score labeled up text is actually zero or High Score Column zero.

63
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:50,460
Or let me do it this way.

64
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:52,110
This will be much more clear.

65
00:04:52,110 --> 00:04:53,420
So high score.

66
00:04:53,910 --> 00:05:04,370
OK so this will display the high score that I score labeled a text and it shows me as a result I identify

67
00:05:04,380 --> 00:05:08,890
year because yep I misspelled the high score.

68
00:05:09,770 --> 00:05:10,810
So this is good.

69
00:05:10,820 --> 00:05:15,500
But if that's not the case this won't be even run right.

70
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:17,440
This won't get executed.

71
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:20,540
So I can just check to see.

72
00:05:20,570 --> 00:05:23,630
Just try to cast this as an integer.

73
00:05:23,630 --> 00:05:32,990
So I'm going to say if left new scar starts high score as integer optional integer casting optionally

74
00:05:32,990 --> 00:05:35,940
as integer that is more correct.

75
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:43,580
And if I can do that it means that there is a new score and it means that I start the value and I can

76
00:05:43,580 --> 00:05:45,350
cast this as an integer.

77
00:05:45,350 --> 00:05:54,080
Now I can just say high score is named score and high score labeled up text is again High Score Column

78
00:05:54,810 --> 00:05:59,030
High Score Column reverse slash high score.

79
00:05:59,030 --> 00:06:01,580
This time I'm going to spell it right.

80
00:06:01,610 --> 00:06:05,060
So high score yeah this is good.

81
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:09,260
So it says that new score is not used but that's not the case.

82
00:06:09,260 --> 00:06:09,800
Yeah.

83
00:06:09,920 --> 00:06:13,400
The warning went away so we're good to go actually.

84
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:17,620
So let me test is to see if that works.

85
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,890
So there is not a high score value stored right now.

86
00:06:21,890 --> 00:06:25,270
And as you can see high score is shown as zero.

87
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,120
So let me try to tap on Kenny if I can.

88
00:06:29,420 --> 00:06:29,840
Yes.

89
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,130
Chris one parent they are not very good at this game.

90
00:06:34,130 --> 00:06:37,950
So as you can see high score is shown as one.

91
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:40,810
So let me try with another high score.

92
00:06:41,030 --> 00:06:43,360
Hopefully I can tap on Kenny.

93
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:46,040
Yeah I did a score of four.

94
00:06:47,030 --> 00:06:48,680
So let's wait.

95
00:06:48,830 --> 00:06:49,640
And here you go.

96
00:06:49,640 --> 00:06:51,760
High score is shown as four.

97
00:06:51,770 --> 00:07:00,030
So let me close this and open it one more time and let's see if we can see the four as high score.

98
00:07:00,050 --> 00:07:01,490
So here we go.

99
00:07:01,550 --> 00:07:07,400
As you can see we managed to save this information in the user defaults.

100
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:13,040
So our game is definitely working and we finished this game actually.

101
00:07:13,640 --> 00:07:19,800
And bear in mind that this game is created by me couple of years ago.

102
00:07:19,910 --> 00:07:25,350
And you can find a lot of clones of this game in the App Store and Google Play.

103
00:07:25,390 --> 00:07:27,710
It's absolutely fine to do that.

104
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:37,280
Just try to find an image that will not cause any royalty problems so you can google for royalty free

105
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:43,580
images and then just try to add some new more features to its for example.

106
00:07:43,580 --> 00:07:51,270
A lot of students have actually implemented some new levels making it harder to tap on Kenny.

107
00:07:51,320 --> 00:07:59,540
So a lot of students actually used cloud servers to save the high scores and try to make a leader board

108
00:07:59,540 --> 00:08:01,510
or something in the game.

109
00:08:01,550 --> 00:08:08,720
You cannot do that with your churns knowledge by the way after you complete the course try and improve

110
00:08:08,930 --> 00:08:11,400
this game a little bit further.

111
00:08:11,510 --> 00:08:12,540
So far so good.

112
00:08:12,540 --> 00:08:18,890
We're going to stop here and within the next section we going to learn about something called Table

113
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:19,610
views.
