00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.110
Hi.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.600
We didn't this lecture.

3
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:05.820
Where are you going to learn about dictionaries.

4
00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:11.850
So we have learned about arrays and in arrays we have ordered collections right.

5
00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:13.350
We have indexes.

6
00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.350
So we have learnt about sets and in sets.

7
00:00:17.490 --> 00:00:25.530
We didn't have ordered collections we had or unordered collections but we had unique elements and inside

8
00:00:25.530 --> 00:00:30.810
of dictionaries we will have key value pairings.

9
00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:37.860
So we're going to have a key and re going to have and they assign the value of that key inside of a

10
00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.260
dictionary.

11
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:47.750
So maybe you cannot imagine what it looks like right now but you will understand why.

12
00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.390
And then we're going to use dictionaries once we do the example.

13
00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:59.460
So suppose that you have and favorite movie array one more time.

14
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:08.460
But rather than just saving the favorite movies you want to save the respective directors of that movies

15
00:01:08.460 --> 00:01:09.330
as well.

16
00:01:09.330 --> 00:01:16.710
For example rather than just saying pulp fiction you have to say pulp fiction and Pulp Fiction is directed

17
00:01:16.710 --> 00:01:17.890
by court.

18
00:01:18.030 --> 00:01:22.970
Quentin Tarantino OK so how do you do that.

19
00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:26.520
You can't put those values into two separate areas right.

20
00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:28.590
You can't have one Barb.

21
00:01:28.770 --> 00:01:35.280
My favorite directors are Ray over here in which you will list your favorite directors like Quentin

22
00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:43.620
Tarantino Guy Ritchie and then you may create another robbery in which you put the respect to values

23
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:51.080
for those directors like you can go like does a Tarantino and then Guy Ritchie.

24
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:54.870
And I can create another array just like this.

25
00:01:54.870 --> 00:02:02.310
And then the first element I can say pulp fiction and then the second elements I can say Lock Stock

26
00:02:02.310 --> 00:02:10.140
Two Smoking Barrels and this will do work but it fool Don't be as efficient as a dictionary because

27
00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:15.300
I can go like this in a dictionary Pulp Fiction and Tarantino.

28
00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:24.720
So all you have to do is just put a column between Key and the valley server the first one is key and

29
00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:33.420
the second one is the valley of death key for Guy Ritchie I'm going to go lock stock and hit a column

30
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.520
and I will say Guy Ritchie for example.

31
00:02:37.080 --> 00:02:40.280
So let us do one more example over here.

32
00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:46.780
The Dark Knight and this will be directed by Christopher Nolan.

33
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:49.740
OK Chris Tubb for Marlo.

34
00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:52.490
So this is a dictionary.

35
00:02:52.530 --> 00:03:01.650
It's very similar to Ray but you put a column between Key and values so if you do my favorite directory

36
00:03:01.650 --> 00:03:08.910
is as you can see this is now a string to string dictionary and key is string and the value is string

37
00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:10.580
as well.

38
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:14.400
Of course it could be string to integer integer to a string.

39
00:03:14.430 --> 00:03:16.020
It doesn't matter.

40
00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.990
So can I do this.

41
00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.640
Of course I can't because dictionaries do not have indexes.

42
00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:30.470
You could have gone for my favorite directors Pulp Fiction and that would be OK.

43
00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:35.730
So rather than giving indexes I give he's in here.

44
00:03:35.730 --> 00:03:44.580
So when I provide a key it will return the value to me so I can go for the Dark Knight for example.

45
00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.470
It will just say Christopher Nolan as you might see on the right hand side.

46
00:03:50.730 --> 00:03:54.060
So this is how you work with a dictionary.

47
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:59.160
K. this is how you create this is how you operate with dictionaries.

48
00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:07.650
For example I can go and say that Pulp Fiction is not Tarantino anymore It's Quentin Tarantino.

49
00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.780
Okay.

50
00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:12.700
And this will change the value of deterrents.

51
00:04:12.750 --> 00:04:14.340
This is now.

52
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:23.370
Quentin Tarantino if I go over and just print my favorite director's dictionary I will see that the

53
00:04:23.370 --> 00:04:28.760
pulp fiction is directed by Quentin Tarantino rather than Tarantino.

54
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.290
So I can actually change the values afterwards.

55
00:04:33.850 --> 00:04:37.500
Furthermore I can do the same thing in the areas as well.

56
00:04:37.500 --> 00:04:38.110
Right.

57
00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.530
So let's go to a one of the areas.

58
00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:41.000
OK.

59
00:04:41.010 --> 00:04:44.730
Let's go to number three here.

60
00:04:44.760 --> 00:04:46.230
So where do we have a number.

61
00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:46.850
Yeah.

62
00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:51.510
Here in the my number or a can I do something like that.

63
00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:55.710
My number first elements I mean the zero.

64
00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.530
OK.

65
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.740
So this is one.

66
00:04:58.770 --> 00:04:59.130
Right.

67
00:04:59.130 --> 00:05:03.750
If I run this I will see one on the right hand side.

68
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.140
But what if I want to change this to 15.

69
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:09.590
Can I do that.

70
00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.180
Of course I can.

71
00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:17.520
If I run this it will show me that my numbers 0 is now 15.

72
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.760
And if I call my number a 0 1 more time over here then I will see 15.

73
00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:30.810
So this is basically the same thing as coming here and saying My favorite directory is Pulp Fiction

74
00:05:31.110 --> 00:05:35.820
is not anymore Tarantino is Quentin Tarantino.

75
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:43.650
OK so how do you append a value like we did in the array section if you do.

76
00:05:43.650 --> 00:05:50.510
My favorite directors that offends you will see that there is no method as a point or insert or put

77
00:05:51.090 --> 00:05:53.750
you will have to do like this.

78
00:05:53.750 --> 00:06:01.950
You will say that my favorite directors and let me do seven samurai for example.

79
00:06:01.980 --> 00:06:02.780
OK.

80
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:07.810
And the director of the seven samurai will be a cure crew soldier.

81
00:06:08.010 --> 00:06:14.050
So the seven samurai is now we kill to Akira queries soba.

82
00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:14.890
OK.

83
00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:23.190
So if I call my favorite directors one more time so let me cut this print and put it over here and let

84
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:24.320
me run this.

85
00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.540
And as you can see now I see my value in my favorite director's dictionary.

86
00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:33.020
So that's how you append and you Ali.

87
00:06:33.030 --> 00:06:36.510
And that's how you change the value over here as well.

88
00:06:37.020 --> 00:06:43.030
So this is again a key value pairing structure.

89
00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.590
And as I said before of course this wouldn't have to be string to string.

90
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:55.290
You can create something like my dictionary and this dictionary just suppose that you're building your

91
00:06:55.290 --> 00:06:56.230
fitness app.

92
00:06:56.370 --> 00:06:58.890
So running is 100 calories.

93
00:06:58.980 --> 00:07:05.030
Swimming is 200 calories and basketball is 300 calories OK.

94
00:07:05.100 --> 00:07:11.460
You can go like that if you just call my dictionary run for example.

95
00:07:11.760 --> 00:07:19.560
So as you can see even here it says String to int dictionary so I can just say my dictionary run and

96
00:07:19.590 --> 00:07:23.580
if I run this I will get one hundreds here.

97
00:07:23.670 --> 00:07:25.370
So this is good right.

98
00:07:25.380 --> 00:07:30.480
We're going to use dictionaries a lot when we build apps as well as you can see.

99
00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:38.030
These are not ordered collections like arrays because it doesn't need to be ordered anyway because we're

100
00:07:38.040 --> 00:07:40.510
not using indexes over here.

101
00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:44.750
We're just calling every value by their keys.

102
00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:49.830
So we have key value pairings in dictionaries.

103
00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:52.130
So we have learned a lot.

104
00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:52.630
Right.

105
00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.300
So we have learned about arrays.

106
00:07:55.440 --> 00:08:03.660
And if you want to have ordered objects like structured objects use arrays if you want to call them

107
00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:13.290
by index use arrays if you want to how every element uniquely in your set in your dataset then you sets

108
00:08:13.770 --> 00:08:20.320
if you want to have a key value pairing then you should go for dictionaries.

109
00:08:20.430 --> 00:08:25.140
And again we're going to see a lot of examples regarding those structures.

110
00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.370
And don't worry about it.

111
00:08:26.370 --> 00:08:32.430
So let us stop here following the next lecture we're going to start learning about loops.
