00:00:00,630 --> 00:00:07,470
Hi within the section where you going to learn how to work with swift UI in order to create stunning

2
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:09,310
user interfaces.

3
00:00:09,750 --> 00:00:16,660
So Apple has just recently released the swift UI and it's better than ever before.

4
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:22,240
So now we can create very structural good user interfaces with this framework.

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,790
So go ahead and create your first project and choose single view app.

6
00:00:26,790 --> 00:00:35,040
And this time make sure that you check this use swift UI bucks as VO And I'm going to name this my first

7
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:36,640
swift UI project.

8
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:42,120
Okay so first swift UI app or swift UI project.

9
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:48,240
And of course if you're going to discuss what is swift UI and what is the difference between swift UI

10
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,710
and the regular method of building user interfaces.

11
00:00:53,100 --> 00:01:02,880
OK so let me put this on my OS folder and let's say update to this and let me make this into a full

12
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,060
screen mode.

13
00:01:04,180 --> 00:01:13,170
OK so like that and you will immediately realize there are some differences between the swift UI projects

14
00:01:13,590 --> 00:01:16,520
and regular swift projects.

15
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:25,440
For example here we have some content to view and we don't even have a v controller over here right.

16
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:35,160
Rather we have some struct ends in the left hand side you will see that we have the app delegate.

17
00:01:35,310 --> 00:01:41,760
We have the scene delegates as usual but we have this content v rather than we have controller and this

18
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:46,400
is the content view that we are already seeing right now.

19
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:50,210
So again on the right hand side you will see something like this.

20
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:58,560
And if you don't see it you can come over here D me and say canvas sell within the canvas we will see

21
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:00,170
our preview.

22
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:05,330
So if you say resume you will see the preview of your app like this.

23
00:02:05,640 --> 00:02:14,220
Even though I'm not running any simulator right now in my project as you can see I'm seeing the project

24
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:22,020
in the preview I'm seeing it as in as simulator and be very that I'm not running any simulator right

25
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:31,310
now but X R is chosen and it's showing my project inside of an X R framework x x r layout.

26
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:34,400
Okay so that's cool right.

27
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:42,390
I can make changes in my coding section and I can immediately see how it looks like in a real life environment

28
00:02:42,690 --> 00:02:45,020
by using this previews.

29
00:02:45,030 --> 00:02:46,870
So this is very good.

30
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,100
So over here we have this text okay.

31
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:55,860
For example rather than saying Kelo swift Hello world I'm going to say swift UI and as you can see it

32
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:02,690
immediately changed the text over here so I can do what I have to do.

33
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:09,230
I can just see the results on the right hand side in swift UI and that's very cool.

34
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:14,460
So that's one of the biggest advantages of swift UI.

35
00:03:14,460 --> 00:03:16,720
So let's see some differences.

36
00:03:16,830 --> 00:03:22,380
Maybe you realize that we don't even have a storyboard right now because we're not going to work with

37
00:03:22,380 --> 00:03:23,380
storyboards.

38
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:30,750
We're not even going to work with the view controllers from now on we will have views rather than view

39
00:03:30,780 --> 00:03:31,800
controllers.

40
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,670
OK we won't have we have controllers we won't have labels.

41
00:03:36,840 --> 00:03:39,540
We won't have table views.

42
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:46,770
If you open your library you will see some other options like we have something called stack over here

43
00:03:46,770 --> 00:03:55,260
and you will see whether this and we have some other options over here like a list like a text and we

44
00:03:55,260 --> 00:04:02,160
see some old schoolers like button and toggle and other things but we have so different options over

45
00:04:02,160 --> 00:04:03,780
here right.

46
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:08,140
And we're going to see how to use them later on.

47
00:04:08,160 --> 00:04:16,650
But know that right now we don't have we controllers we don't have old views we have everything in a

48
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:21,510
new way but the good thing is the coding doesn't change.

49
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:28,890
We can use the swift knowledge we can use the swift structure as it is in here.

50
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:37,080
So we have this struct right and the inside of our struct we have a body and inside of our body we have

51
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:38,100
some views.

52
00:04:38,820 --> 00:04:40,230
So that's what we're going to do.

53
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:47,570
We're going to create views inside of our body and we're going to work with those views inside of swift

54
00:04:47,580 --> 00:04:48,580
UI.

55
00:04:48,730 --> 00:04:58,220
And once you master suite UI you will be free more than ever to create stunning user interfaces.

56
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:00,740
And again it's a little but different.

57
00:05:00,740 --> 00:05:07,730
It's a little bit more difficult compared to the conventional ways to create user interfaces but once

58
00:05:07,730 --> 00:05:10,860
you get to know it then you will love it.

59
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:17,360
OK so within the section where you're going to have a crash course on Swift UI and we're going to see

60
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,590
the basics the introduction part of swift UI so that we can create good user interfaces.

61
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:27,470
Let's continue within the next lecture.
