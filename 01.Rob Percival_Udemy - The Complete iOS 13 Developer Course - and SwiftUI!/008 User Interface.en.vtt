00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:08.030
Hi we within this lecture we going to design our first Apps user interface and there's an app we're

2
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.020
going to build something like this.

3
00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:14.930
There is going to be an image and there's going to be a bottom.

4
00:00:15.060 --> 00:00:18.790
If I click the button the image will change.

5
00:00:18.840 --> 00:00:25.070
So we're going to build every simple app but you're going to get comfortable with the X gold while we're

6
00:00:25.080 --> 00:00:26.640
doing this.

7
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.770
We're not doing this in order to learn about programming or swifts.

8
00:00:30.780 --> 00:00:35.250
We're just doing this as an example to get comfortable with X code.

9
00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:42.160
So I'm going to go to Google dot com and I'm going to get and download two images.

10
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.310
So I'm going to search for Metallica because that's my favorite bands.

11
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:52.740
You can't do it for your own band or you can just do it with your own picture or own images.

12
00:00:52.770 --> 00:00:57.910
We have to just get two images to display in our app.

13
00:00:57.930 --> 00:00:58.920
OK.

14
00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:02.490
I recommend you do that with your own favorite band.

15
00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:08.790
So if you don't have a favorite band just go with Metallica because they're very good.

16
00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:14.130
So let's choose one of them and say Save image two downloads.

17
00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:15.510
OK.

18
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:20.980
And you can actually use your own images in your own computer if you have one.

19
00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:26.730
So I believe there is something wrong because I couldn't download this.

20
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:30.210
So maybe we can go for another image like that.

21
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.030
OK.

22
00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:33.180
So let me try this one right click.

23
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:38.190
Say we need to download this and let's see if we managed to download it.

24
00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:38.620
Yep.

25
00:01:38.640 --> 00:01:40.780
This time this works.

26
00:01:40.890 --> 00:01:43.890
And let me go back and find another one.

27
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:48.980
Let me try to download this and I believe it's done as well.

28
00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:57.690
So let me open the downloads folder and you'll see the two images but we will need to rename them because

29
00:01:57.690 --> 00:02:04.290
it's way too complicated for an image I'm going to just name them Metallica and the other one we'll

30
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.910
be Metallica too.

31
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:07.210
OK.

32
00:02:07.380 --> 00:02:16.290
Right now I'm going to get this Jay Pags into my folder into my project and remember where we put them.

33
00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.730
I said something about a stats folder right.

34
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:25.710
So in the left hand side you will see those assets if you click on those you will see something like

35
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.160
that this empty space.

36
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:32.790
So if you get your images you can just put them over here.

37
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.200
Just choose two images and drag and drop over here.

38
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.370
So right now these images are embedded in your projects and that's kind of cool right.

39
00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:51.690
This is how you import these pictures and you will see something called 1 x 2 extra x in here.

40
00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:53.870
Don't worry about those right now.

41
00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.820
This is generally created for having different sizes different kind of images for different screen sizes.

42
00:03:02.850 --> 00:03:03.480
OK.

43
00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:10.410
So for right now if you're working with an eye for instance you will need a three X image and if you're

44
00:03:10.410 --> 00:03:14.580
working for iPhone s e you will need that one X image.

45
00:03:14.580 --> 00:03:18.320
And if you click on this app icon thing you will see the same thing.

46
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:21.900
This is where you place your icon app icon.

47
00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.660
Okay logo of your app.

48
00:03:23.790 --> 00:03:28.620
So you can see different sizes are required to put here.

49
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:36.450
And if you're a designer designing for an app with a photoshop or a sketch or Adobe Steve you can create

50
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:45.450
your app logos you can create your app icons in this sizes and you can just drag and drop them over

51
00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.230
here.

52
00:03:46.230 --> 00:03:50.630
And don't worry about those as all we're going to see how to do that later on.

53
00:03:50.940 --> 00:03:56.200
And of course this is not a design course but this is rather an IOW development course.

54
00:03:56.580 --> 00:04:04.140
I'm going to show you how to do that in Adobe X or sketch but I'm not going go into details because

55
00:04:04.170 --> 00:04:06.190
I'm not a designer myself as well.

56
00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.770
I'm just going to show you how to create very beautiful apps I'm just going to teach you how to code.

57
00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:14.780
OK.

58
00:04:14.970 --> 00:04:16.500
And this is the same thing.

59
00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.180
So if you see one acts you can just provide some two acts and three acts or resolutions for your app

60
00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:24.710
as well.

61
00:04:25.350 --> 00:04:32.700
And as I said we're not going to worry about that right now we're just going to go to main that storyboard

62
00:04:32.730 --> 00:04:38.830
and delete this helos we've label that we previously had because we don't need it.

63
00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:48.360
Rather we need something to put our images to and for label we can't have a label as a text or as a

64
00:04:48.360 --> 00:04:56.840
title for our app and for other purposes we need an image and we need that bottom.

65
00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:57.560
Cape.

66
00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:04.170
So you can drag and drop this pain as you see two anywhere and you can just hit this button or you can

67
00:05:04.260 --> 00:05:11.260
hit shift command and Al in your keyboard to open this library because you're going to use this a lot.

68
00:05:11.490 --> 00:05:19.530
So click on this plus about an hour shift command an and near your keyboard and you can search for objects

69
00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:27.930
in the search pane or you can just scroll down to see different kinds of object different kinds of views

70
00:05:28.200 --> 00:05:31.650
that you have here to drag and drop.

71
00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:37.710
For example you can search for image and you will see something called Image view and that's exactly

72
00:05:37.710 --> 00:05:40.770
what we want in our project.

73
00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:46.780
So drag and drop the Image view on your app over here okay on your storyboard.

74
00:05:46.860 --> 00:05:51.150
So we can't resize it in a way that we want like that.

75
00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:56.030
OK so this is not showing any images right now.

76
00:05:56.040 --> 00:05:56.340
Right.

77
00:05:56.340 --> 00:05:58.860
So I'm going to fix that later on.

78
00:05:58.890 --> 00:06:02.810
So if you click on this you will see the attribute Spain.

79
00:06:02.910 --> 00:06:09.510
So we can choose some options over here like we can choose the image that you're displaying inside of

80
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:10.830
this image view.

81
00:06:11.520 --> 00:06:18.480
So if you click on this image attributes you will see different kinds of options and Metallica and Metallica

82
00:06:18.510 --> 00:06:20.390
to appearing over here.

83
00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.480
And these are pre-built images in the X code.

84
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.020
So for example I'm going to go for Metallica and it will display the image for me.

85
00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.010
And in here you will see something called contend mode.

86
00:06:35.010 --> 00:06:44.220
You can see shoes as packed fit as packed feel you can't use scale to feel and you can adjust your picture

87
00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:50.040
you can adjust your image and you can choose the best option for you.

88
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:51.070
OK.

89
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:56.130
Right now I'm going to go for a packed fit and that's it.

90
00:06:56.130 --> 00:07:04.480
Actually that's how you display your image inside of an image view inside of your app and don't worry

91
00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:08.800
we're going to see the details of this later on.

92
00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:16.750
We're just doing this for example three reasons we're not learning how to create an app right now.

93
00:07:16.750 --> 00:07:18.090
We're just practicing.

94
00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:21.600
In order to get comfortable with X code.

95
00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:23.920
So next we need a button.

96
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:24.400
Right.

97
00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.140
We need to something to click on.

98
00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:34.740
So when a user taps on this button then a user clicks on this button it will just change the picture.

99
00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:38.250
As I said before that's our project.

100
00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:44.580
So let me go over here and search for button and just choose one of those.

101
00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:50.640
Actually you have to choose the bottom because these other things are related to bar items and we're

102
00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:56.380
going to see what it is later on after you choose your button.

103
00:07:56.380 --> 00:08:02.090
Make sure you make it a little bit bigger like this and put it into the middle.

104
00:08:02.410 --> 00:08:08.410
As you can see the guidelines are appearing saying that it seemed to me though and go to the attributes

105
00:08:08.410 --> 00:08:12.400
inspector in which you can choose the details of this them.

106
00:08:12.550 --> 00:08:17.980
If I choose the image it will display the options for image if I choose the button it will display the

107
00:08:17.980 --> 00:08:19.890
options for bottom.

108
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:24.820
So maybe we can change the name of this button like change.

109
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:25.550
Why change.

110
00:08:25.570 --> 00:08:31.500
Because when we click on this button it will change the picture it will change the image right.

111
00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:36.340
It will change this Metallica one to Metallica too.

112
00:08:36.670 --> 00:08:37.990
So that's it.

113
00:08:38.020 --> 00:08:39.520
That's our app.

114
00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:42.960
And this looks very ugly actually.

115
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:50.800
So I'm going to go over and add a label to my app and this won't fix the ugliness but at least it will

116
00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:54.300
look a little bit better in my view.

117
00:08:54.290 --> 00:08:58.980
So let me make this label a little bit bigger.

118
00:08:59.350 --> 00:09:00.260
OK.

119
00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:04.170
Just choose and drag here.

120
00:09:04.420 --> 00:09:09.790
I'm trying to put this on the middle of the screen and make this a little bit bigger as you can see

121
00:09:09.790 --> 00:09:16.180
it's very easy to do that using x code and we can change the alignment from here.

122
00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:17.740
We can change the tax.

123
00:09:17.740 --> 00:09:23.350
Like my Metallica app or Metallica app whatever you want.

124
00:09:23.800 --> 00:09:32.050
You can increase the phones you can decrease the font you can choose the color maybe you can play with

125
00:09:32.050 --> 00:09:36.690
this to see how does it look like on your own app.

126
00:09:36.790 --> 00:09:43.180
What are we going to learn about layouts are we going to learn about user interfaces more in-depth later

127
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:43.360
on.

128
00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.500
Don't worry.

129
00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:52.480
Right now I'm ready actually for my user interface but I'm going to do a lasting go over here to something

130
00:09:52.480 --> 00:09:55.710
called Resolve auto layout issues.

131
00:09:55.710 --> 00:10:02.830
So does kind of destroy angler button over here and you will see you cannot click on anything in order

132
00:10:02.830 --> 00:10:07.270
to click on anything you should click over here to view.

133
00:10:07.270 --> 00:10:15.490
OK so you can choose the view over here or you can just click on this blank screen and then you can

134
00:10:15.490 --> 00:10:18.480
choose one of those options.

135
00:10:18.550 --> 00:10:23.530
So I'm going to go for this reset suggests that the constraints on the bottom.

136
00:10:23.560 --> 00:10:24.760
OK.

137
00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:29.920
When I do that it will add some little blue lines over here.

138
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:38.490
These are called constraints and we use constraints to constrain our viewing to a specific order.

139
00:10:38.560 --> 00:10:44.200
So they will appear in the right place in the right time in the right phone.

140
00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:44.770
OK.

141
00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:50.760
So we use them to have the same view in the iPhone X are as in the iPhone as eat.

142
00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:58.360
So for right now let's let's run our code in the simulator because we're going to learn about constraints

143
00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:02.400
a lot later on in the layout section.

144
00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:05.700
And as you can see my app looks good right.

145
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:13.120
So I have what I need here I have my title I have my image I have my change by them of course if I click

146
00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:19.030
on this change by then nothing will happen because we didn't write any code regarding to it.

147
00:11:19.220 --> 00:11:25.690
We're going to take care of that in the next lecture and we are going to see how to change our image

148
00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:32.900
using code because right now we can only manually change it in the attribute section we don't want that.

149
00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:40.000
We want to to have a code in which user can change the picture whenever they want.
