Hi within this lecture we're going to see something called mutating function and it's again related

2
00:00:07,650 --> 00:00:10,700
to immutability of this drugs.

3
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,070
So can I have a function inside of our class.

4
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:15,090
Of course we can.

5
00:00:15,690 --> 00:00:18,870
Let's create a happy birthday function.

6
00:00:18,870 --> 00:00:27,630
And in this function I'm going to add one to our current H So s that age will be plus equal to 1.

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:28,910
OK.

8
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:30,540
So that's easy.

9
00:00:30,540 --> 00:00:33,730
Can I do that in musician struct.

10
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,000
We will see let's try that first with our existing class.

11
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:41,660
So let me comment this out.

12
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:43,230
So let me comment.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:47,520
All of the prints out so that we will have an empty log.

14
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:52,630
Okay so let's comment out let's comment out this as well.

15
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:59,730
So over here I'm going to call this function versus mutating function.

16
00:00:59,770 --> 00:01:04,870
Okay under here I'm going to call my James class.

17
00:01:04,930 --> 00:01:06,810
Okay so Class James sorry.

18
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:14,160
Class James starts H if I print this let's actually run this because I don't even remember what was

19
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:15,520
our current H.

20
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:15,890
Yeah.

21
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:17,710
It was 52.

22
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:20,460
Now let's call class James Dot.

23
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:21,520
Happy birthday.

24
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:27,420
And let's then print out one more time to see the new age of James.

25
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:29,460
It will be fifty three right.

26
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:32,980
This is what we expect and it will be fifty three.

27
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:33,400
Yep.

28
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:34,430
This is good.

29
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,090
And this works as we expect.

30
00:01:37,170 --> 00:01:39,960
But can we do that with struct.

31
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:47,430
Yeah of course we can have functions inside of our struct but let's create the same function over here

32
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:53,010
and let's try to change the s that age and add one.

33
00:01:53,010 --> 00:01:55,960
This will give us an error window.

34
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,600
Age is a variable.

35
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,120
This have isn't movable.

36
00:02:00,170 --> 00:02:00,950
Okay.

37
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:09,060
The struct itself its is is immutable so we cannot change this in order to change this.

38
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:13,530
There is a keyword that we can use in front of our function.

39
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:17,610
We can make this function mutating function.

40
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:18,410
Okay.

41
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:25,230
And then we do that you will see the error will go away so that we can use this same function as we

42
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:28,280
want inside of our main that Swift.

43
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:29,920
So let's try to do that.

44
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,880
Visit our struct James.

45
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,090
Okay let's print out this struct James H.

46
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:39,460
Let me comment this out and this one as well.

47
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:44,150
Let me run this and let's see if we get the fifty one.

48
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,100
Yep we have the 51.

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,000
Let's call struct James that's happy birthday and let's print destruct.

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,460
James age buy more time.

51
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,800
So let's see if we get fifty two.

52
00:02:57,810 --> 00:02:58,890
Here you go.

53
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:01,020
Now we have the fifty two.

54
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:09,180
So you have to keep in mind that if you want to change ever able inside of your struct you have to make

55
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:18,990
that function mutating function because the S is immutable instructs So Reagan's top here and within

56
00:03:18,990 --> 00:03:23,460
the next lecture we we're going to see a new concept called tuple.
