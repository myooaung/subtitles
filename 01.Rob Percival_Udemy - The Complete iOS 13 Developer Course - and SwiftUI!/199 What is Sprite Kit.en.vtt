00:00:00.980 --> 00:00:07.370
High within the section where you're going to be building our first game with Sprite kit.

2
00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:15.800
So we're going to see what is a sprite kit and how we can use it to create two full games on ISIS.

3
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:22.280
So I'm gonna go for ISIS tap here but we're not going to go for a single view at this time but rather

4
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.310
we're going to go for this game tap.

5
00:00:25.580 --> 00:00:26.300
OK.

6
00:00:26.690 --> 00:00:35.240
So after you choose this game you will be presented with some kind of new options like this game technology

7
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:41.150
any here I'm going to go for a rebirth clone or Angry Bird.

8
00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:41.620
Okay.

9
00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:44.130
So that's what we're going to build.

10
00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:46.640
And in language of course we're going to go for Swift.

11
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:49.930
But in here we have some game technology.

12
00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:53.890
So we're going to work with Sprite Keith as I said before.

13
00:00:53.930 --> 00:00:55.130
But why.

14
00:00:55.160 --> 00:01:00.590
Sprite kid is actually ideal for creating too these games.

15
00:01:00.590 --> 00:01:07.740
So if you want to build 3D games you're more than welcome to go with seeing kids or reality kids.

16
00:01:07.940 --> 00:01:12.380
And of course we're going to use the sink kids again later on.

17
00:01:12.380 --> 00:01:15.820
But in the augmented reality section.

18
00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:16.570
OK.

19
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:23.570
So it's kind of treaty option but we're going to work with Sprite kids this time because we want to

20
00:01:23.570 --> 00:01:25.880
build it to the game.

21
00:01:25.970 --> 00:01:29.320
And here is something called metal.

22
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:36.980
So if you choose metal it means that you're creating your own game world and you're working directly

23
00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.910
with the graphic processing units.

24
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:46.820
So if you want to work closely with GP you if you're an advanced game developer that you're more than

25
00:01:46.820 --> 00:01:48.510
welcome to choose metal.

26
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:57.950
But in our case we want sprite kids so that we will have the ready to go physical worlds so that we

27
00:01:57.950 --> 00:01:59.880
can build our game with them.

28
00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:09.350
So choose this bright kid and we don't want any tests or any other option over here so we can just hit

29
00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:12.720
next to create our project.

30
00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:17.240
I'm going to create mine under us complete as well.

31
00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:18.490
And here you go.

32
00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.950
So right we get our project.

33
00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:30.770
You will immediately realize there are some differences compared to regular swift Fila swift projects.

34
00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:35.770
So here is our app delegate and it's exactly the same thing as we had before.

35
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:36.070
Right.

36
00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:38.410
So there are no differences here.

37
00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:46.820
So let's come to game scene that as k s so this is the file that we design our app.

38
00:02:46.820 --> 00:02:54.050
So this is kind of the Neve main storyboards for us as you can see this is the frame of our phone or

39
00:02:54.050 --> 00:02:57.680
out of our scene and inside of this frame.

40
00:02:57.680 --> 00:03:06.320
We have this Heller label and it's not called a label anymore actually it's called cold sprites or nodes

41
00:03:06.740 --> 00:03:08.480
in the sprite kids.

42
00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:16.030
We're going to talk about terminology but as you can see there is a predefined label over here and we're

43
00:03:16.040 --> 00:03:19.870
going to run to see what does label does later on.

44
00:03:20.780 --> 00:03:28.830
But right now know that we will do the design inside of our game scene that SCA.

45
00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:37.310
So this is the design section but we have another options over here like actions that are scarce and

46
00:03:37.310 --> 00:03:46.280
as you can see there is a there's some sort of a timeline or we're here in which we can define our actions

47
00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:53.780
like I believe there is a fade action over here like a fade in and don't worry we're going to see how

48
00:03:53.780 --> 00:04:01.610
to create actions or animations we generally going to use the coding section in order to do that but

49
00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:10.850
we have these two SARS files that we can work with that we can put some new views and we can give it

50
00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:17.300
some animations using this space where are you going to see both ways where you're going to create some

51
00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.340
views over here.

52
00:04:18.380 --> 00:04:22.520
But we're going to do that in the coding section as well.

53
00:04:22.610 --> 00:04:26.260
So if you come over to game See you will see a lot of codes.

54
00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:29.790
So that's where we're going to write other codes.

55
00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:34.560
And in here we have our old regular view controller.

56
00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:41.960
And if you go over to Main storyboard you will see there is another thing on our storyboard and we won't

57
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.920
touch the storyboard in this case because we have our game scene that has scars.

58
00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:51.290
So we are going to be working within our game scene.

59
00:04:51.890 --> 00:05:00.520
So game we have controller actually just hold some kind of configuration settings for us every to be

60
00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:06.430
writing the game inside of our scene as you can see there there is.

61
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:13.890
There is something called the label or here and we see the label over here as well.

62
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:18.780
So I believe right now you have understood the structure we're here.

63
00:05:18.790 --> 00:05:21.890
We are going to be writing our code in the game scene.

64
00:05:21.910 --> 00:05:29.140
We are going to design our gaming the game scene that is chaos and in fact we going to delete everything

65
00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:32.920
from here and we going to write it from scratch.

66
00:05:32.980 --> 00:05:40.180
So I will just run the simulator and show you what this code does but we're not going to be working

67
00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:41.740
on this code again.

68
00:05:41.830 --> 00:05:47.620
We will learn how to write our code from scratch as usual.

69
00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.980
So let me open this simulator.

70
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:54.890
And once his was we will see the hell a world label.

71
00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:58.420
And also I believe we're going to see some action as well.

72
00:05:58.750 --> 00:06:00.640
So this is hella worlds.

73
00:06:00.970 --> 00:06:09.460
And if I tap on anywhere over here it will just create some circles or I don't know it's polygon or

74
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:10.720
a rectangle.

75
00:06:10.720 --> 00:06:14.310
So it's kind of a shape that turns and burns.

76
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.750
So this is cool right.

77
00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:23.260
This is one of the examples that what we can do with these sprite kids but we're not going to do this

78
00:06:23.260 --> 00:06:27.690
because it's not even a game we're going to create the game for ourselves.

79
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:34.840
So we're going to delete everything from the game scene that's swift and we're going to write our own

80
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:39.310
codes and we're not even going to use this in a portrait mode.

81
00:06:39.310 --> 00:06:42.920
We're going to be using this in a landscape mode.

82
00:06:43.570 --> 00:06:43.990
OK.

83
00:06:44.020 --> 00:06:45.990
So you feel how come so far.

84
00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:52.330
I believe we can stop here and within the next lecture we're going to discuss where we can find some

85
00:06:52.330 --> 00:06:55.540
good images to work on for our game.
