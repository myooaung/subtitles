Hi.

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:06,610
We didn't the section we're going to learn how to work with maps in order to do that.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:09,890
We're going to build an app called travel book.

4
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:12,220
So this is kind of a travel app.

5
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:20,580
Suppose that our user is travelling and she sees a good landmark that she wants to tag on the map so

6
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:25,650
that she can find her way back when she wants to visit that place again.

7
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:33,270
For example let's click on the note rhythm as you can see we're tagging the notes for them canter ruling

8
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:36,750
here and there is a pin on the note rhythm category.

9
00:00:36,990 --> 00:00:40,370
So this is pinned by the user herself.

10
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:41,100
Okay.

11
00:00:41,130 --> 00:00:46,790
If I click on it it will display an icon over here and if I click on that I can.

12
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:52,350
It will take me to that Notre Dame Cathedral within navigation.

13
00:00:52,380 --> 00:00:58,520
So this is my current place and I can just go by driving walking or whatever I want.

14
00:00:59,370 --> 00:01:07,320
And also I can tag other places like cafes restaurants anywhere in the map I won't actually say if I

15
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:15,790
want to add a new place I can hit on plus by them and it zooms in the current location of the user.

16
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:23,670
So I'm here right now and I can choose whenever I want to whatever I want to tag on the map and I can

17
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:25,200
just come over here.

18
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:32,340
For example let's say that this is my hotel and I want to take my hotel so that I can find my way back.

19
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:37,190
So let's say that this is hotel invited ace.

20
00:01:37,530 --> 00:01:40,300
And the comment will be my hotel.

21
00:01:40,380 --> 00:01:44,860
So I fly long press over here for three seconds.

22
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,560
It will bring a pin.

23
00:01:46,980 --> 00:01:51,800
And if I click on that pin it will just display the information that I have written.

24
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,830
If I hit the save button it will just add it to my list.

25
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:02,550
As you can see we're using the card data so that this information will not be deleted defy open and

26
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:03,700
close the app.

27
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:06,990
If I go over and open and close my phone.

28
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:13,200
So we're going to practice the core data one more time and we're going to learn how to do this kind

29
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:21,090
of things with the maps like navigation like tagging using the maps finding the user location zooming

30
00:02:21,090 --> 00:02:22,330
in zooming out.

31
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:29,220
We're going to learn them all and we're going to learn by practicing by building this travel book app.

32
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:36,350
This is a real app that you can really improve and put on your app store after you complete this course.

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,600
So if you're ready let's get started.
