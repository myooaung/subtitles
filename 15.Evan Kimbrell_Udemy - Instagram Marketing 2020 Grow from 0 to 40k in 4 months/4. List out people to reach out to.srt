Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:02,100
OK.
2

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:07,380
Last lecture, we created a Google sheet where we set up
a little framework for collecting and sorting accounts
3

4
00:00:07,380 --> 00:00:10,200
that are in our space and therefore worth knowing about.
4

5
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:13,500
In this lecture, we're going to add
two more things worth sorting by.
5

6
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:19,830
So, first off, I want to mark accounts that I consider
worth watching. This could be an account that posts 
6

7
00:00:19,830 --> 00:00:21,720
similar content to you,
7

8
00:00:21,780 --> 00:00:25,660
it could be one that has an interesting
content strategy just in general,
8

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,390
maybe they interact with their users in a way that
you think is effective or unique, maybe they just
9

10
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:36,540
have a great content mix, or just post really high quality
stuff, or hey, I don't know, maybe they're just popular.
10

11
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:37,620
have a great content mix, or just post really high quality
stuff, or hey, I don't know, maybe they're just popular.
11

12
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:43,140
These are all reasons that you might want to watch
an account. Later on, when you're stuck or just feel
12

13
00:00:43,140 --> 00:00:44,640
the need for inspiration,
13

14
00:00:44,690 --> 00:00:49,550
you'll have a list of go-tos that you can
check in with and see what they're posting.
14

15
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:52,600
So take a second to mark these in some way.
15

16
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,820
You could put like an extra column and then put
an X in it, or you could just highlight them.
16

17
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,000
Doesn't really matter.
17

18
00:00:59,040 --> 00:01:01,330
Just some way you can remember them later.
18

19
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:04,790
This might require going back to the
accounts and then looking at them.
19

20
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:10,990
But honestly, if they didn't stick out to you in the first
place, then they might not be worth watching.
20

21
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,880
So the next thing I want you to do after that
is add a column and label it "complementary."
21

22
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,620
What we want to do with this is we want to mark accounts
that we think, number one, don't compete directly with us,
22

23
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:23,110
What we want to do with this is we want to mark accounts
that we think, number one, don't compete directly with us,
23

24
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,410
and number two, have stuff that we think our audience might like.
24

25
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:33,140
If we're using the travel app example, for instance,
someone who posts, let's say, tips about flying
25

26
00:01:33,140 --> 00:01:38,610
would probably be targeting a similar enough
audience - frequent flyers or travelers.
26

27
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:44,450
Now, would someone who cares about travel tips
also enjoy funny photos of airplane mishaps?
27

28
00:01:44,450 --> 00:01:50,220
Yeah, probably. One in the space that's not complementary
might be, you know, those people that are posting
28

29
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:56,100
luxury first class section photos, those are probably
first class flyers or people who want luxury porn,
29

30
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:01,710
so showing them photos of things that happened in the class
they don't want to fly in probably isn't what they want.
30

31
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:02,720
so showing them photos of things that happened in the class
they don't want to fly in probably isn't what they want.
31

32
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:06,550
They pay in general to avoid that stuff,
they pay a lot of money too.
32

33
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:10,500
So try your best to make that critical judgment for these accounts.
33

34
00:02:10,650 --> 00:02:14,820
The reason we're doing this now is that so when we
get to the marketing portion of the course, we can
34

35
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:15,960
hit the ground running.
35

36
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:20,970
One of the fastest ways to grow on Instagram is through
what are called shoutouts, which we'll explain way
36

37
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:25,600
more in depth later on, but they require
complementary accounts to work with.
37

38
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:31,530
Marking them now puts them in your head and hopefully
will help you build relationships now, so that
38

39
00:02:31,530 --> 00:02:34,530
later the promotion partnership is way easier.
39

40
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:37,380
OK, go ahead and mark these,
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
