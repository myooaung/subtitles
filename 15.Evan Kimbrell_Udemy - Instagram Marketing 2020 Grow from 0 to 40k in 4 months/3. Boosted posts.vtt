00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:01.620
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.620 --> 00:00:06.850
So this lecture we're going to dive into the first type of Instagram and which is a boosted post.

3
00:00:07.080 --> 00:00:12.210
Now does it really feel necessarily like an ad but really it is and it's kind of unique to Instagram

4
00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:16.400
because the only way you can actually do them is through the Instagram app.

5
00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.240
Surprisingly you can actually do this to the web user interface you have to do it through their phone.

6
00:00:21.270 --> 00:00:27.750
Either way Bustos are an interesting way of growing your following or to increase the effectiveness

7
00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:31.080
of say an ad post that you've made.

8
00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.570
Let's say you have a podcast coming out and you make one of those preview posts where you say who it

9
00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:38.060
is you're going to talk about and when.

10
00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:39.840
Well you could do that.

11
00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:45.540
And because that's kind of it's a pretty subtle way of promoting something that could be pretty effective

12
00:00:45.540 --> 00:00:50.980
as a out there and you might see me in the fall longs play around a little bit with boosted ads.

13
00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.880
And I did them at the very beginning because I wanted to test out what types of content were going to

14
00:00:56.880 --> 00:00:58.050
work with what type of group.

15
00:00:58.060 --> 00:01:05.160
So once I got a decent idea of who my audience was overwhelmingly male typically 25 to 35 and for the

16
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:10.110
most part in the United States UK and Australia so English base and there's also a decent contingent

17
00:01:10.110 --> 00:01:10.610
in India.

18
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:16.890
Then I started using Doucette post to kind of see how the reaction amongst people were to get an idea

19
00:01:16.890 --> 00:01:23.370
of OK this 3D printed house is pretty popular this jacket with a bunch of extra features and not so

20
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:27.440
much but outside of testing there's other ways that you can use this effectively.

21
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:33.420
And I personally just like to think of it as a way if you have a really good piece of content to promote

22
00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:33.810
it.

23
00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:35.070
Now typically the best way.

24
00:01:35.180 --> 00:01:42.160
I mean I go about using google if I do it is to first identify a piece of content that did really well.

25
00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:48.210
So one way you can do this is by using icons Square which we set up earlier in the course.

26
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:54.480
But if you remember icons square for me specifically doesn't work that well because I had tried different

27
00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:01.340
types of promotional techniques and so some of the posts are not organically going to be ranked the

28
00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:02.020
best.

29
00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:07.280
It's more so that I picked a couple that were doing OK and then I promoted them more so.

30
00:02:07.290 --> 00:02:10.040
So keep that in mind when we look at my list.

31
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.610
But for you guys it should be fine.

32
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:16.560
Assuming you've had a consistent strategy that you've stuck to so if you go to analytics over here on

33
00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:22.470
the left and then go to engagement you can use one of two different metrics to decide which pieces of

34
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.190
your content the best one is engagement and what is reach.

35
00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:29.010
So the most engaging thing I have now kind of depends.

36
00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:30.530
Now you remember this is one of the earliest ones.

37
00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:35.070
It says most engaging media and because it was in my earliest ones my engagement rate is something insane

38
00:02:35.070 --> 00:02:40.520
because I only had like five followers and it got a bunch of likes so that doesn't mean anything unfortunately.

39
00:02:40.530 --> 00:02:43.270
So I like to look over here and look at most liked and most common to.

40
00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:47.580
So it kind of depends what I'm going for if I think that people commenting are most likely going to

41
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.250
follow me that I might go for this one.

42
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:55.310
I think people who liked it the most are then therefore going to click over and follow me more and that

43
00:02:55.310 --> 00:02:56.160
I might go with this one.

44
00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:03.950
But either way this is where I would check out and see what the analytics system says is my best.

45
00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:07.900
And then all I can do is look at reach and see if there is a similar pattern there.

46
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.590
You really kind of have to make a call so media with highest reach it's these right here now.

47
00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:19.080
These just breach is just a function of whether or not Instagram thinks it's interesting to a lot of

48
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:19.560
people.

49
00:03:19.560 --> 00:03:24.900
Remember this is also taking into account that they change their algorithm halfway through the course.

50
00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.250
So I kind of take this with a grain of salt.

51
00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:32.460
These look like these are all pretty engaging but it also looks like back here you know here are some

52
00:03:32.460 --> 00:03:33.280
other options.

53
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.490
Try to get this one this little robot that seemed to piss everybody off the most is probably the one

54
00:03:38.490 --> 00:03:42.470
I should go for him because it also shows up at my top reach.

55
00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:47.960
OK so that would be a very simple criteria I could use for picking something to promote.

56
00:03:47.970 --> 00:03:51.670
So what I would want to do is go fetch that post down.

57
00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:54.530
So I just have to scroll and see if I can find it.

58
00:03:54.700 --> 00:03:55.000
OK.

59
00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:56.050
So it's right here.

60
00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:00.160
And actually as it turns out I did promote this once upon a time.

61
00:04:00.330 --> 00:04:05.030
And what we can see right here is that we can actually view the insights from that promotion.

62
00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:11.250
I don't actually know why I did this but you can see I spent around $150 so that was just an experiment

63
00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:12.250
to see how that work.

64
00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:16.640
And as you can see it gives us some basic analytics up front as to how that went.

65
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:23.610
So it said you know 779 promotion clicks got 905 people will look at it this is probably over the course

66
00:04:23.610 --> 00:04:30.240
of a couple of months even and then it says 130 bucks for 268 followers so you can kind of do the math

67
00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:35.150
right there but that's like one point seven followers per dollar.

68
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.110
So that's generally speaking pretty bad.

69
00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:40.020
So just kind of keep that in mind.

70
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:41.430
Remember we did Page shout outs.

71
00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:44.840
We were getting anywhere from three to one to five to one.

72
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:52.860
But to demonstrate how to actually do one of these posts let's just take one that personally.

73
00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:58.840
OK so here we go here's a carrousel post and this is using that wearable keyboard thing that is the

74
00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:01.990
most liked untypically carrousel posts are pretty popular.

75
00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.880
Just because there's a whole bunch of tech one person doesn't like that one post they can swipe to see

76
00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:09.120
if they like the next you to like it actually they like the next.

77
00:05:09.200 --> 00:05:13.480
Also works in a content strategy because people seeing this will see that hey my account covers lots

78
00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:17.920
of things and not just this one it might actually might actually be confusing like am I actually promoting

79
00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:20.090
this keyboard typing thing whatever.

80
00:05:20.380 --> 00:05:20.670
OK.

81
00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:26.260
So if I look at the insites typically a good way of telling whether or not something should be promoted

82
00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:32.340
outside of using Arcano squares to look at that personage under discovery says weren't following you.

83
00:05:32.350 --> 00:05:36.520
Now that can range anywhere from 1 percent to 80 percent.

84
00:05:36.580 --> 00:05:42.400
And for me at least anything over 10 percent means that Instagram liked it ok and then Instagram pushed

85
00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:47.310
it out to other people since the Instagram algorithm apocalypse just recently.

86
00:05:47.470 --> 00:05:51.870
It's not very easy to get free views on Instagram.

87
00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:57.850
They typically only show it to your own friends so if they have a decent percentage over 10 percent

88
00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:00.740
that's generally a sign that hey this one performed well.

89
00:06:00.940 --> 00:06:03.100
So that's usually something that I like to go off of.

90
00:06:03.100 --> 00:06:05.610
So if I want to promote it and does it promote right here.

91
00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:06.080
OK.

92
00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:08.490
Now the next thing is what are your goals.

93
00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:12.350
More profile visits more website traffic and more promotion views.

94
00:06:12.350 --> 00:06:15.700
Now the first one is if you want to promote your account.

95
00:06:15.760 --> 00:06:21.610
OK so you're just trying to get more people to it to increase your engagement or more likely more followers

96
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:22.290
than you would like.

97
00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:28.390
That first one more website traffic would make the most sense if you're actually trying to sell something

98
00:06:28.420 --> 00:06:32.220
especially if the post was for something that you were selling for innovation station.

99
00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:36.790
Maybe we make an online store we sell a lot of these things that we cover that could be interesting

100
00:06:36.790 --> 00:06:39.630
considering a lot of people keep asking for that over and over again.

101
00:06:39.790 --> 00:06:45.760
So maybe then we would put the Web site you R-AL direct link to the actual thing that we're trying to

102
00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:48.220
sell and that could be kind of interesting.

103
00:06:48.340 --> 00:06:50.550
And the last thing is just more promotion views.

104
00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:56.770
So this is kind of a mix between do you want them to go to your profile do you want them to go to your

105
00:06:56.770 --> 00:07:00.830
business address this is something if you're a local store that's something you would use.

106
00:07:01.090 --> 00:07:05.290
So let's say you're running a video but your grand opening you want people to visit you in person you

107
00:07:05.290 --> 00:07:09.820
would select that one and then phone number perhaps if you're looking for leads.

108
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:14.960
Let's say you are a tattoo artist OK and you just made a video about a tattoo you gave and you want

109
00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:16.960
people to call you for leads.

110
00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.240
That's how you would do that to keep this simple we're just going to do more profile visits and I think

111
00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:25.270
that since you know innovation we don't mean really to sell.

112
00:07:25.290 --> 00:07:27.760
That's not particularly relevant to use these other ones.

113
00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:29.980
So for the most part they all kind of work the same way.

114
00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.280
When you get next which is going to take you to target audience.

115
00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:36.760
Now there's three different ways you can do this one automatically and Sprint has a lot of data.

116
00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:42.100
So it's up to you whether or not you trust them to figure out what group of people based on what they've

117
00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.860
seen before are most likely to like or comment or follow you.

118
00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:51.820
I typically trust Instagram on that one because they have all the data that we don't want is local.

119
00:07:51.820 --> 00:07:53.070
So this is pretty important.

120
00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:56.970
If you run a local business pretty easy you just pick your actual location.

121
00:07:56.980 --> 00:07:59.830
So let's see my current location right there.

122
00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:02.620
It's done right now middle of Denver.

123
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:04.510
And then you could pick a radius like this.

124
00:08:04.540 --> 00:08:10.990
So if I was working in person or physically selling something I could do this and then target my gender's

125
00:08:11.020 --> 00:08:14.820
and my age so I can go back.

126
00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:22.180
The last thing is just manual so if you think you have a better grasp of who should follow you or look

127
00:08:22.180 --> 00:08:23.890
for your promotions do this.

128
00:08:23.890 --> 00:08:30.880
Also if you're say promoting something very specific let's say I'm selling a shoe and the shoe is very

129
00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:37.510
let's say it appeals to a certain type of person then what I might want to do is go to a manual and

130
00:08:37.510 --> 00:08:44.350
pick this type of person specifically because if I do the automatic it's going to look at how popular

131
00:08:44.350 --> 00:08:49.150
my account is as a whole and to look at that audience as a whole whereas I know this post might be more

132
00:08:49.150 --> 00:08:50.390
specific.

133
00:08:50.410 --> 00:08:56.080
So for this one what we could do is just to show you how to set up your manual audiences.

134
00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:00.780
We can do a manual audio sources say manual give it a name and we'll say this is our test.

135
00:09:00.780 --> 00:09:06.110
Audience locations it has Colorado but I don't actually care about that.

136
00:09:06.110 --> 00:09:11.980
So innovations Asians more focused on us and then let's say Canada.

137
00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:16.090
And those are kind of big too just because of time zones.

138
00:09:16.150 --> 00:09:21.720
It's not that we don't want to invite people from China news Bekka stay and France and all that.

139
00:09:21.730 --> 00:09:26.390
It's just that I post during a certain time period so make sense to focus on this.

140
00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:27.270
OK then I could go.

141
00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:30.810
Interests interests are pretty loose.

142
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.780
You can type in whatever you think this post is going to appeal to.

143
00:09:34.780 --> 00:09:44.440
So my post again was about cool technology so I said robots we could pick the robot robotics say robotics

144
00:09:44.570 --> 00:09:48.260
it could say technology.

145
00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:54.460
So you get see the people who have a bachelor in technology might be interested in something like this

146
00:09:54.730 --> 00:09:57.550
if it's specific let's say military technology that could be interesting.

147
00:09:57.640 --> 00:09:59.720
Those health technology that could be interesting.

148
00:09:59.830 --> 00:10:05.320
A lot of times you health tech so you could say robotics hell technology and then I like to do things

149
00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:08.080
like social entrepreneurship.

150
00:10:08.390 --> 00:10:09.130
So I like that.

151
00:10:09.130 --> 00:10:13.060
So basically people were interested in starting ventures or selling products that helped the world.

152
00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.870
That tends to be a good group of people for me.

153
00:10:15.900 --> 00:10:20.980
Now the general rule of thumb with interest is and as many as you can as long as you keep it relevant

154
00:10:21.010 --> 00:10:25.160
there's no benefit to adding 10 if you can't justifiably think of 10.

155
00:10:25.180 --> 00:10:29.500
The only caveat that Instagram is really going to drill down on those two days time is a problem is

156
00:10:29.500 --> 00:10:34.240
if say like you only added 1 and it's a really specific interest which means that you might actually

157
00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.070
have trouble displaying all your ads.

158
00:10:36.080 --> 00:10:41.020
Again it's not that big of a deal because it didn't take longer to spend your money but just something

159
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:42.120
to keep in mind.

160
00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:48.220
Now age and gender I just noticed that this is typically my age range right there.

161
00:10:48.220 --> 00:10:53.040
It might actually scale a little bit older but maybe that's not really the range that I want to go for

162
00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:59.620
and then for whatever reason male Instagram users are way more interested in my posts.

163
00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:05.080
Ok so I have this set up now if I wanted to change something else it's always get me saved right there

164
00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:06.660
so I can just select it whenever I want.

165
00:11:06.670 --> 00:11:06.880
OK.

166
00:11:06.880 --> 00:11:07.720
And the next thing you do is it.

167
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:12.610
Next thing you get your budget and duration and it's really up to you you can do whatever you want.

168
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.140
Keep in mind if you run an ad and it's not doing well you can cancel it very easily by just finding

169
00:11:17.140 --> 00:11:22.510
the post and then will have a button that says see promotion and you can click Cancel promotion it's

170
00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:23.680
really easy.

171
00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:28.340
So let's just say we want to do on this one for five days and we could spend 50 bucks.

172
00:11:28.370 --> 00:11:29.120
OK whatever.

173
00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:35.590
So next they know what it is it's going to do is it'll set you up so you can preview promotion and you're

174
00:11:35.590 --> 00:11:38.890
going to have to set up your credit card information.

175
00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:43.930
And since we already set up Facebook before as a business account we probably already have our payment

176
00:11:43.930 --> 00:11:48.340
information attached if you don't it'll prompt you to go do that and I think you can do that through

177
00:11:48.340 --> 00:11:49.220
the app.

178
00:11:49.630 --> 00:11:52.020
You can do it in the app and you have to set it up to Facebook.

179
00:11:52.030 --> 00:11:53.540
You only do it one time.

180
00:11:53.770 --> 00:11:56.260
So I can preview the promotion Let's see how this looks.

181
00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.340
And as you can see right here at the top it says sponsored.

182
00:11:59.440 --> 00:11:59.760
Right.

183
00:11:59.770 --> 00:12:05.500
That's the biggest difference it's going to say sponsored and some of those big bold blue bar that says

184
00:12:05.550 --> 00:12:11.380
you Instagram profile are the two kind of giveaways is a boosted post and since I already have a lot

185
00:12:11.380 --> 00:12:16.190
of comments on this post those will get promoted as well so it's not going to look like a fresh post.

186
00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:22.660
Ok so once I know that I'm good with it go back and then I just check over to make sure everything I

187
00:12:22.660 --> 00:12:25.560
have is set up correctly the action button is automatic.

188
00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.530
If I'm looking for a profile visit it's always going to say visit unscreened profile.

189
00:12:29.600 --> 00:12:36.240
If I was doing leads it would say like call now or give the business address if there was a visit or

190
00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:40.240
you are l and it would be like a learn more button it usually gives you the options to choose different

191
00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:40.630
ones.

192
00:12:40.620 --> 00:12:42.270
So then I it create promotion.

193
00:12:42.280 --> 00:12:46.500
And typically this never works the first time I do it I have to click it several times so the video

194
00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:48.350
is being processed Please try again later.

195
00:12:48.490 --> 00:12:49.400
This is what I do.

196
00:12:49.450 --> 00:12:52.260
I just keep pressing it until it goes.

197
00:12:52.340 --> 00:12:54.340
And typically the carousel videos.

198
00:12:54.850 --> 00:12:58.030
It's actually pretty iffy whether or not they'll even accept it.

199
00:12:58.030 --> 00:13:03.410
Currently you kind of just have to keep hitting this because they're just bypassing you and eventually

200
00:13:03.410 --> 00:13:04.260
it will go through.

201
00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:04.810
OK.

202
00:13:04.810 --> 00:13:11.060
So I just ran a promotion for a different post because oh my god it's takes forever.

203
00:13:11.070 --> 00:13:15.110
If you do a carousel video post and I just want to get across what this is supposed to look like.

204
00:13:15.210 --> 00:13:20.950
So this just pops out it says pray your things when you started your promotion and then all say is pending

205
00:13:20.950 --> 00:13:22.390
approval.

206
00:13:22.450 --> 00:13:27.640
View insites is not going to tell anything right now but it'll give me things like how long the promotion

207
00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:28.240
has lasted.

208
00:13:28.240 --> 00:13:31.390
They will say my spin when I spend is fifty dollars.

209
00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:35.770
So very quickly what I can do is I can look at this and say oh if there's $10 spent I can look up here

210
00:13:35.770 --> 00:13:37.640
and see follows and another baselines five.

211
00:13:37.650 --> 00:13:40.900
So anything above that is what's been attributed to the promotion.

212
00:13:40.900 --> 00:13:47.720
So if let's say come back and it's 15 follows and I spent $10 that means I'm sitting a dollar per follow

213
00:13:47.730 --> 00:13:49.710
and if that's my goal that's pretty bad.

214
00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:55.270
So I might actually cancel that and then just try to dip my toes in a different ad and try something

215
00:13:55.270 --> 00:13:55.760
else.

216
00:13:55.810 --> 00:13:59.230
That's the way you can be the most effective with your boosted post at least.

217
00:13:59.230 --> 00:14:00.510
All right guys that's it for now.

218
00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:04.130
Next lecture will dive into regular post as so you then.
