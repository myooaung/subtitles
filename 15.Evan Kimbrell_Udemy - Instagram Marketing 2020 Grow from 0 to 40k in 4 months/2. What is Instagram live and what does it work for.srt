00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,660
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,740 --> 00:00:07,170
So this lecture around to do is we're going to talk about Instagram live now Instagram live is a feature

3
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:10,210
that got rolled out as I'm recording this.

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,430
A year ago something like that and the basic idea is pretty simple.

5
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:23,130
What you're allowed to do is run a live screen of whatever your camera is looking at.

6
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:29,160
And anyone who follows you will get a notification and then they can hop in into kind of a live chat

7
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:30,960
room and then follow along.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,980
It's essentially a copycat of Periscope which when you guys are watching this or you know periscope

9
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:38,950
you exists anymore.

10
00:00:38,970 --> 00:00:44,490
But the whole idea of periscope was that you can film yourself live doing something and there was a

11
00:00:44,490 --> 00:00:47,060
lot of creativity that came from that.

12
00:00:47,070 --> 00:00:51,720
A lot of people really took advantage of this new medium to engage their followers and to do some pretty

13
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:52,770
interesting things.

14
00:00:52,790 --> 00:00:55,670
Lindsey Graham live is pretty much just an extension of that.

15
00:00:55,710 --> 00:01:04,440
And for the most part people use it to break up their typical content strategy and to use it as a way

16
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:08,850
to kind of bring attention immediately to whatever it is that you're doing.

17
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:14,220
Now it's not immediately obvious if you've never watched one of these how you can use this to grow your

18
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,460
business and I'll be honest when I say this right up front.

19
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,350
It's Instagram live is one of my least favorite features just because it's not immediately obvious at

20
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:28,560
least for me how I could use this for the follow along that account is an innovation station and it's

21
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,580
also something that I don't I don't do a lot of live content.

22
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:36,480
So if I were to switch to a strategy that uses a lot I really have to put some thought into how to make

23
00:01:36,480 --> 00:01:39,310
it work and how to pull it off on short notice.

24
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:48,090
So typically we see this with someone We'll go live and it'll be let's say like an educational Q&amp;A.

25
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:49,880
They can do live workshops.

26
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,180
I've seen people do live tutorials on how to do something.

27
00:01:54,180 --> 00:02:01,020
Also I've seen businesses use this as a way to tease a product launch to talk about something to show

28
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:01,710
it off.

29
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,530
Also have seen it be pretty effective with like flash sales.

30
00:02:04,530 --> 00:02:09,210
So if you have something that you need to sell any of your higher inventory on something you can on

31
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:17,220
a live and show it off and play with it and give a exclusive discount to someone who buys that.

32
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:18,290
If you're a company.

33
00:02:18,300 --> 00:02:20,510
I've also seen this work pretty well.

34
00:02:20,500 --> 00:02:23,720
If you have news about your company that's a nice little impromptu.

35
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:31,290
You just jump in and say hey we got acquired or Hey we just launched this new feature something that's

36
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:36,720
worth while that's something that's not necessarily something you would have made a well-polished press

37
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:37,580
release about.

38
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:40,480
Now you have a personal account what I've seen work the best.

39
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,160
Our Q&amp;A is what you do is it's pretty simple.

40
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:51,930
You can just make a post and say taking questions for a live Q&amp;A and then you can even do it as a story

41
00:02:52,050 --> 00:02:57,480
and in the story there's a sticker now where you can submit questions and you can kind of use that to

42
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:01,800
gather a bunch of questions and then during your live you can answer those.

43
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:05,760
You can also just do it as a live impromptu kind of Q&amp;A.

44
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:09,120
You have people in the chat room ask questions.

45
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:15,060
My only suggestion to that is just be careful because sometimes the crowd can get unruly depending on

46
00:03:15,060 --> 00:03:20,190
its size and also just the way it's set up it's kind of hard to read all the questions so if you're

47
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:25,920
answering a question and someone asks another one a lot of times it's hard to go and go back and find

48
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:27,070
a good question.

49
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,500
It's usually best practice if you're going to do that to have somebody with you who can at least like

50
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:34,650
be paying attention to the comments while you focus on the content.

51
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:37,360
Another thing that works pretty well are giveaways.

52
00:03:37,440 --> 00:03:41,370
Now kind of combining this with a different section later on when we talk about what giveaways work

53
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:41,980
the best.

54
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,730
But if you have something that you want to give away just as a way to reward your followers or get them

55
00:03:47,730 --> 00:03:52,550
to engage then it's pretty easy just to say I'm going have a giveaway to a certain time.

56
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:56,880
Did you run the live and it's a give away and then you just kind of have to come up with the rules for

57
00:03:56,880 --> 00:03:57,630
people watching.

58
00:03:57,630 --> 00:04:00,940
What do they have to do to actually get this stuff.

59
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:05,700
It's even better as your account gets larger because as you get larger What you can do is you can give

60
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:10,050
away someone else's stuff which is really nice because you don't spend any money.

61
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:14,460
And as long as he makes sure the stuff is giving away it fits within the theme of your account then

62
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:16,250
it's a pretty win win situation.

63
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,740
So there are three best practices that I think you should be aware of before setting out on an Instagram

64
00:04:22,740 --> 00:04:24,090
wife.

65
00:04:24,330 --> 00:04:30,330
The first one is you need to understand the engagement metrics and what makes a live video work.

66
00:04:30,340 --> 00:04:36,330
Now the whole idea with this is we're not only trying to engage our followers and reward them but also

67
00:04:36,330 --> 00:04:38,630
we're trying to use this as a platform to get more followers.

68
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,290
And the way that we get more followers is by if we get enough engagement and enough viewers it will

69
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:47,510
slowly start to creep up and start showing on the explore page.

70
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,410
Now how many viewers and comments you have to get to get to that point.

71
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:53,230
We don't really know.

72
00:04:53,220 --> 00:04:56,120
It kind of just depends.

73
00:04:56,520 --> 00:05:00,180
I indicated and I'm going to tell us that because of it did it make everything way to.

74
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,150
So just keep that in mind it's comments and it's viewers you want to keep your viewers on as long as

75
00:05:05,150 --> 00:05:08,330
possible and you want to get them to comment as much as possible.

76
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,230
OK.

77
00:05:09,230 --> 00:05:12,290
Now there's a lot different ways that you can do that and it's kind of up to you.

78
00:05:12,290 --> 00:05:15,130
I mean it's this is one of these things that I still don't think is solidified.

79
00:05:15,140 --> 00:05:20,750
There is no guaranteed way of increasing your gauge on Instagram live but I've seen some clever things

80
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:26,720
like for instance when these accounts run to me live sometimes I'll do giveaways.

81
00:05:26,840 --> 00:05:30,740
And the way that they'll do it is look give away let's say a shout out or an item and they'll ask the

82
00:05:30,740 --> 00:05:36,140
person to answer a question they ask them to answer it in the comments one letter at a time and they

83
00:05:36,140 --> 00:05:40,270
have to answer it without having their chain broken.

84
00:05:40,340 --> 00:05:46,170
That is actually kind of a I mean it actually works because people will try to answer it really quickly

85
00:05:46,170 --> 00:05:47,270
and multiple people trying to do it.

86
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:52,970
Keep breaking each other's chain even though it kind of does lower the quality of the chat room as a

87
00:05:52,970 --> 00:05:58,700
whole so if you're trying to get people to engage by reading the chat room and reading questions or

88
00:05:58,700 --> 00:06:01,580
actual interesting things that can backfire a little bit.

89
00:06:01,580 --> 00:06:07,240
Now the second best practice for you to be lines is always to promote your life beforehand.

90
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:07,540
OK.

91
00:06:07,550 --> 00:06:12,860
It's really easy to throw up a story post because remember me in the stories section we made a story

92
00:06:12,860 --> 00:06:13,880
post for a give away.

93
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:17,330
It was really easy to do I did it in like 30 seconds.

94
00:06:17,330 --> 00:06:21,830
Throw that up and keep letting people know when it is set a date.

95
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:26,540
Make sure you have the time zone and then tell them about it and on the day of perfect.

96
00:06:26,540 --> 00:06:32,390
I personally like to throw up a regular post and a story at the same time saying we're giving away this

97
00:06:32,390 --> 00:06:38,900
or we're going to do a live Q&amp;A at this time and that's a really easy way to get people to jump in.

98
00:06:38,910 --> 00:06:44,750
Now you don't have to make like a brand new post for this because that could actually take a little

99
00:06:44,750 --> 00:06:45,650
bit time.

100
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:49,370
You can make it in a story post and then save that as a regular post.

101
00:06:49,370 --> 00:06:50,900
That's a pretty easy feature to do.

102
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:56,690
And then number three try to give them something at the end if you're doing a product promotion try

103
00:06:56,690 --> 00:06:58,120
to give them a coupon at the end.

104
00:06:58,130 --> 00:07:03,470
Tell them that there's a coupon at the end if it's a cue in a tell them that you know the most interesting

105
00:07:03,470 --> 00:07:08,150
question will be at the very end where you are announcing something that's really interesting at the

106
00:07:08,150 --> 00:07:08,690
end.

107
00:07:08,690 --> 00:07:14,300
The idea here is that you want to make sure that your live count like the viewer count stays consistent

108
00:07:14,310 --> 00:07:18,130
you don't want people checking and getting the value and then immediately leaving.

109
00:07:18,140 --> 00:07:20,580
So by telling them that something will be at the end of it.

110
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:24,590
And typically it helps to tell them this is like a 15 minute thing or a 20 minute thing or whatever

111
00:07:24,950 --> 00:07:31,280
that can incentivize people to stay long enough which will help your metrics and ultimately your goal

112
00:07:31,370 --> 00:07:35,810
with the SCRAM line which is to get more people to your live video.

113
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:37,760
All right guys that's pretty much it for now.

114
00:07:37,760 --> 00:07:41,780
Make sure that you promote your life beforehand.

115
00:07:41,810 --> 00:07:43,470
Make sure you're specific about it.

116
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:47,510
Make sure that you give something away and then make sure that whatever you're doing you're designing

117
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,620
it for two things in mind.

118
00:07:48,620 --> 00:07:51,410
Total Viewers and total comments.

119
00:07:51,410 --> 00:07:56,160
That's really what's going to make this important if you're trying to get new viewers in and not just

120
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:57,400
engage the ones you have.

121
00:07:57,470 --> 00:08:01,910
All right next we're going to do is just go over that you and I will show you how you can set up a live

122
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:06,640
video and then after that we'll do a live demonstration of a live.

123
00:08:06,660 --> 00:08:09,130
Sorry for being redundant for innovation station.

124
00:08:09,260 --> 00:08:09,920
All right CNN.
