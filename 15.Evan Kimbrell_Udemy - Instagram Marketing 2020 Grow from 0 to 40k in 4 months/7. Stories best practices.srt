00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,720
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,720 --> 00:00:07,700
So this lecture we're going to do is go over five or six best practices associated using Instagram stories.

3
00:00:07,710 --> 00:00:11,490
Now you watch this entire section and you're not entirely convinced about whether or not you should

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,340
use stories.

5
00:00:12,490 --> 00:00:14,700
Well I don't necessarily blame you.

6
00:00:14,730 --> 00:00:18,060
I think it's a kind of nice to have not necessarily a need to have.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,730
Like I said before there are teams out there or accounts that focus on their stories more than their

8
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:28,650
posts and that's just because they find that it's easier to take advantage of that 24 hour and then

9
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:31,300
disappear kind of mentality of stories.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:35,290
And also some people have just found that their followers respond to that more.

11
00:00:35,310 --> 00:00:41,100
But for most of you I think it's worth trying and then seeing if it is something that is worth the amount

12
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:42,170
of effort.

13
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:48,210
As far as I'm concerned when I look at my analytics it's not like it's obvious that these are making

14
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:50,390
a huge contribution to our account.

15
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,340
But when I look at how much time and effort it takes it's just nothing.

16
00:00:54,360 --> 00:00:57,990
So any little benefit I get from it I think is generally worth it.

17
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:01,380
I also think it makes the account look better because it looks like it's more active.

18
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:07,050
So the first best practice I would say with Instagram stories is being careful about not posting too

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:07,680
many.

20
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,990
Now when you think not too many you might think Oh he means don't post for a day or three a day.

21
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:19,350
No actually this isn't like posts with stories you can get away with a lot more because it's literally

22
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:20,990
just a click to move on.

23
00:01:21,150 --> 00:01:26,790
But what you'll notice is if for instance you have more than 15 like the bar is much much higher you'll

24
00:01:26,790 --> 00:01:32,160
find a lot of people actually end up muting you and that's not good or what'll happen is they'll see

25
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:35,930
so many that they're less likely to even view the ones that you have.

26
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:39,210
And they'll just click through it really really quickly and then it will end up happening is Instagram

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:44,410
will see that your completion rates are just going down or the steeply go down very quickly.

28
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:51,030
And so when Instagram shows their stories on the home page it's actually going to put it later on in

29
00:01:51,030 --> 00:01:53,970
the list so it's even less likely that someone will even get to it.

30
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:55,200
So not too many.

31
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,240
But keep in mind too many is actually a lot right.

32
00:01:58,270 --> 00:02:00,960
You could post 10 a day and that's perfectly fine.

33
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:04,470
Number two is trying to make sure that you have a point with it right.

34
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:09,580
It's one thing to just post something that says hey funny dog or hey this was funny.

35
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:12,030
You need to make sure that there's some point right.

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,090
Like when we post it because we want people to go look at our posts or if I post a poll it's because

37
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:25,170
I need information from them so don't post something that's just static content that's not going to

38
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,310
get a response or get them to go do something.

39
00:02:28,350 --> 00:02:33,150
And the best way honestly to make sure that you do this is just to make sure that you have called actions.

40
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,110
Now a lot of people don't use called actions and it's kind of.

41
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:37,300
But I think it's probably the best thing you can do.

42
00:02:37,470 --> 00:02:42,100
Add something at the very end that says you know like tell us if you like this.

43
00:02:42,150 --> 00:02:43,240
What do you think.

44
00:02:43,250 --> 00:02:49,280
Or get them to go to your page and actually post on one of the posts or do something like that.

45
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:55,110
You need some form of engagement to get them off of just kind of brainlessly clicking through if you

46
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:58,170
have too much of a passive and scream story strategy.

47
00:02:58,170 --> 00:03:01,050
What you'll find is that your stats just kind of end up flatlining.

48
00:03:01,050 --> 00:03:03,930
They don't really seem to grow and they don't really seem to die.

49
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,110
It just seems like you have a lot of people that is mindlessly going through it.

50
00:03:07,110 --> 00:03:12,150
Number theory is you need to make sure that you're posting these right around the same time that you're

51
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:13,810
posting your actual post.

52
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:18,930
I don't mean that you have to do exactly what innovation nation does where we just like post something

53
00:03:19,110 --> 00:03:22,330
immediately after we make the actual regular post.

54
00:03:22,350 --> 00:03:27,090
What I mean is that you need to follow the same standards that you use with posting and that you need

55
00:03:27,090 --> 00:03:31,900
to post when your audience is a week and during their highest engagement points and or.

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,630
Generically speaking.

57
00:03:33,630 --> 00:03:38,180

58
9:00 a.m. 12:00 noon 6:00 p.m. I believe it was.

59
00:03:38,190 --> 00:03:43,770
And then like 11:00 and 2:00 a.m. Those are those hot spots where a lot of people are active.

60
00:03:43,770 --> 00:03:48,180
Of course it could be different for your followers specifically and that's why it's really important

61
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,460
that you sign up for some basic analytics like Arcano Square will just tell us when our followers are

62
00:03:53,460 --> 00:03:54,600
most active.

63
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:59,100
The reason why this is important is every time you post a story it jumps the line and for the stories

64
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,880
list.

65
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:05,640
So if you're posting these say when your primary audience is asleep they'll still have it cued up to

66
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:10,140
watch it just by the time they wake up they'll have to watch like 10 sets of stories before they even

67
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:11,530
get to yours.

68
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:16,850
So it actually makes sense to use the same posting strategy with regards to timing for your stories.

69
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:22,560
Number four is really get used to using stickers that is just something that makes this so much more

70
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:28,650
worthwhile it's so easy to decorate something easily by throwing confetti on it or an emoji or a smiley

71
00:04:28,650 --> 00:04:30,240
face or something like that.

72
00:04:30,270 --> 00:04:32,610
That's the easiest part about this.

73
00:04:32,610 --> 00:04:37,140
Don't try to treat this like you know you're making some beautifully designed Photoshop image you put

74
00:04:37,140 --> 00:04:38,830
a lot of time into it and then put in your story.

75
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:40,100
That's kind of defeating the purpose.

76
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:43,310
Use emojis and the stickers to bridge that gap.

77
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,830
Well that being said also you need to focus on using location tags using hash tags stickers and even

78
00:04:49,830 --> 00:04:55,590
mentioning people as well because that actually is what's going to take this from being a static strategy

79
00:04:55,590 --> 00:04:59,870
of just getting your already followers to come back to your page which is fine.

80
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:03,330
But you can then use it to actually increase your reach.

81
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,050
So it's really easy just add a couple of hashtags to it just like you would a post and then all of a

82
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:12,870
sudden you know that in the analytics you're getting views from areas of the app that you wouldn't traditionally

83
00:05:12,870 --> 00:05:13,680
have had.

84
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:19,650
So you're kind of chasing opportunity if you're not using these hash tags and tags and location tags

85
00:05:19,650 --> 00:05:24,310
to get the stories farther out there and in front of eyeballs that haven't seen your account before.

86
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,500
And then the last thing I'll say is just make sure you get creative and mix it up.

87
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:31,180
Right there's a lot of opportunities here for your company.

88
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:37,010
So easy to just film something your employees are doing are behind the scenes cut.

89
00:05:37,110 --> 00:05:42,840
It's really easy if you're an individual to just flip it open and talk directly to your followers say

90
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:46,600
what's on your mind say some lesson you learned today something like that.

91
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:49,020
People really do like that type of content.

92
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:51,440
Also don't be afraid to use things like user generated content.

93
00:05:51,450 --> 00:05:56,700
Right if someone puts a really funny comment on your and scram post screenshot it put some stickers

94
00:05:56,790 --> 00:05:59,240
on it and put a comment and then post as a story.

95
00:05:59,250 --> 00:06:00,640
People really enjoy that stuff.

96
00:06:00,660 --> 00:06:05,700
So just try to get creative people to get the most creative with these are rewarded the most.

97
00:06:05,700 --> 00:06:06,060
Why.

98
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:11,520
Because if you actually play around with different formats and you actually make every single story

99
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,560
different you're just going to have a lot higher engagement.

100
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,370
People are going to predictably actually watch each one because they know that the next one could be

101
00:06:20,370 --> 00:06:24,960
totally different than the one before and I admit this is something that we kind of rule we break with

102
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:29,050
innovation station we kind of keep it simple by posting the posts that we have.

103
00:06:29,130 --> 00:06:33,420
If I was spinning a little more more time on stories I'd put a little bit more time into this but as

104
00:06:33,420 --> 00:06:36,510
a themed account I generally think stories are not as important.

105
00:06:36,630 --> 00:06:38,950
But I still obviously still think they're worth doing.

106
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:39,450
So that's it.

107
00:06:39,450 --> 00:06:40,420
Get creative.

108
00:06:40,440 --> 00:06:46,170
Honestly find things that you think are funny and rotate them take quotes from some of your customers

109
00:06:46,170 --> 00:06:51,990
and throw it up there whatever it is you're doing at the moment could do a very quick 10 second clip

110
00:06:51,990 --> 00:06:52,570
of it.

111
00:06:52,570 --> 00:06:54,870
Throw some stickers on there and there you go.

112
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:55,800
All right guys that's it for now.

113
00:06:55,800 --> 00:07:01,260
Those are the six rules or pieces of advice I've found work the best of course everybody's strategy

114
00:07:01,260 --> 00:07:02,250
is a little bit different.

115
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:04,260
Do you guys have anything that's worked really well for you.

116
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:09,540
Make sure to post in the sac or post in the Q&amp;A and tell us why it worked or how you did it and we can

117
00:07:09,540 --> 00:07:10,200
discuss it.

118
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:10,530
All right guys.

119
00:07:10,530 --> 00:07:12,870
That being said Roland in the next section the.
