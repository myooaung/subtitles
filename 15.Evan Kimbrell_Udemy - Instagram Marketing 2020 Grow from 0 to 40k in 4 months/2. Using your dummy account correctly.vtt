Hey guys, welcome back. This lecture is a quick one.
1

2
00:00:03.390 --> 00:00:08.250
We're going to talk a little bit about habits and 
how you use your dummy account correctly.
2

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:13.910
Now, if you remember, dummy accounts were the other 
accounts that were similar to the official ones that
3

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:17.250
we started that we use to play around with.
4

5
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.590
we started that we use to play around with.
5

6
00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:21.290
We originally set up one at the very 
beginning to use it as a sandbox, 
6

7
00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:26.100
also we hadn't decided on a name, so it was easy to just 
pick whatever was available and start screwing around with
7

8
00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:31.510
the user interface on Instagram. Dummy accounts play 
into successful habits just as much as the other ones.
8

9
00:00:31.530 --> 00:00:37.780
Now, there's a reason why we made one. My dummy 
account for Innovation Station is @omgtechnology or 
9

10
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:41.870
@ohsoinnovative - I don't know, I have 
several. Now, in the short term,
10

11
00:00:41.910 --> 00:00:49.440
what we want to do is every time we post, set a quick 
habit.Now, the habit would be, before I post, I'm going to
11

12
00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:52.370
post this on the dummy account first.
12

13
00:00:52.420 --> 00:00:57.690
OK, now, why would I do that? One, you don't know 
how the post looks. If you're not using a template or it's
13

14
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.120
something you posted before,
14

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.120
you don't know if it's going to come out weird.
15

16
00:01:01.160 --> 00:01:06.000
It sometimes does, honestly. Sometimes you 
shrink down the photo, it looks wrong,
16

17
00:01:06.030 --> 00:01:08.020
the comment you put gets cut off,
17

18
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:12.510
whatever it is. If you put it on the 
dummy account, you can see how it is,
18

19
00:01:12.510 --> 00:01:16.820
make tweaks, and then decide to go 
and put it on your main account.
19

20
00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:20.650
Now, also get in the habit of using your 
dummy account to test out new things.
20

21
00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:20.880
Now, also get in the habit of using your 
dummy account to test out new things.
21

22
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.310
If you want to change your bio link, try that on 
22

23
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:23.730
If you want to change your bio link, try that on 
23

24
00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:26.040
your dummy account first. If you want to change your bio text,
24

25
00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:31.140
try that on your dummy account. If you want to 
try a new color or a new style, try that there.
25

26
00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:35.470
So at first we use the dummy account just 
so our main one doesn't look like crap when
26

27
00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.370
we make bad posts, that's it, and then in the intermediate, 
27

28
00:01:37.430 --> 00:01:39.050
we make bad posts, that's it, and then in the intermediate, 
28

29
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.510
we use it to see how new styles work.
29

30
00:01:42.510 --> 00:01:42.810
we use it to see how new styles work.
30

31
00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.130
Because it doesn't make sense on our official account
31

32
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:52.160
to constantly switch from one color to the other,
videos to quote boards, to live action Go Pro shots.
32

33
00:01:52.170 --> 00:01:53.250
It just doesn't make sense.
33

34
00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:56.590
We don't want that inconsistency happening.
34

35
00:01:56.790 --> 00:02:00.440
That is what causes people to unfollow 
your account. So, occasionally,
35

36
00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:06.750
I've seen this. People change up what they did and they start 
posting different photos, and all of a sudden people start
36

37
00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.040
disappearing.
37

38
00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:12.840
For example, I know someone who runs a tour company 
and they used to take photos in a very specific place called North
38

39
00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:17.000
Korea, and built up their entire Instagram following on that,
39

40
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:20.370
and then all of a sudden they started 
sharing posts of other interesting 
40

41
00:02:20.370 --> 00:02:26.520
places around the world, but they weren't that specific 
place, and their follower count slowly just went through
41

42
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:27.910
a process of attrition.
42

43
00:02:27.930 --> 00:02:29.240
They had no idea why,
43

44
00:02:29.310 --> 00:02:34.600
until they eventually figured it out, but they already 
lost like 7,000 followers or something like that.
44

45
00:02:34.620 --> 00:02:40.950
Also, on the intermediate term, you can try out other things
like types of posts. It's not just a stylistic thing, maybe you
45

46
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:42.110
just make a post that's totally different.
46

47
00:02:42.120 --> 00:02:42.890
just make a post that's totally different.
47

48
00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:45.940
Maybe change the tone on a post. Maybe you're 
usually funny, in your dummy account
48

49
00:02:45.980 --> 00:02:47.390
Maybe change the tone on a post. Maybe you're 
usually funny, in your dummy account
49

50
00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:49.110
Maybe change the tone on a post. Maybe you're 
usually funny, in your dummy account
50

51
00:02:49.250 --> 00:02:52.080
you switch to serious, because we don't really care if there is
51

52
00:02:52.140 --> 00:02:58.980
consistency in the dummy account, doesn't really matter. What you can do is when you do that and you make a change, let's say you change
52

53
00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:03.830
the tone or you change the type of content 
you post, or the color scheme, or whatever.
53

54
00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:06.150
You can make a one to one comparison
54

55
00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:08.530
when you post on both with the engagement rate.
55

56
00:03:08.820 --> 00:03:12.650
So let's say you decided you want to try motivational 
quotes, so you post that on your dummy account.
56

57
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:18.450
And when you run a calculation on your engagement rate - if
you don't remember this, it's how many people like your photo
57

58
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:19.040
And when you run a calculation on your engagement rate - if
you don't remember this, it's how many people like your photo
58

59
00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.700
plus how many people comment on it, and then 
you divide that by your total followers.
59

60
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:24.690
Let's say you did it, and guess what?
60

61
00:03:24.690 --> 00:03:25.560
Let's say you did it, and guess what?
61

62
00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:26.990
You had 4%, that was your engagement rate for your dummy.
62

63
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.090
You had 4%, that was your engagement rate for your dummy.
63

64
00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:28.790
You had 4%, that was your engagement rate for your dummy.
64

65
00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.660
Now, if you went back and looked at your 
official account, and looked at your video posts,
65

66
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:30.950
Now, if you went back and looked at your 
official account, and looked at your video posts,
66

67
00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:32.900
Now, if you went back and looked at your 
official account, and looked at your video posts,
67

68
00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.810
and on average you're only getting 2.5%,
68

69
00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:37.140
well then, guess what?
69

70
00:03:37.210 --> 00:03:41.240
It might be the case that motivational quotes
work and it's worth investigating, and
70

71
00:03:41.270 --> 00:03:47.430
that's the correct way of testing this out before you jump into the deep end of your main account. Now, the last thing we use the dummy account for
71

72
00:03:47.570 --> 00:03:51.800
in the long term is for testing new audiences.
72

73
00:03:51.810 --> 00:03:58.230
That's one thing, the way we follow people, and we'll 
set up bots later on to do this for us, is by going to who
73

74
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:02.280
we think is a competitor and then 
just going after their followers.
74

75
00:04:02.470 --> 00:04:05.680
But there are other ways of doing this. 
Let's say with Innovation Station
75

76
00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:12.720
I'm targeting people who work in business, call themselves
entrepreneurs, people who consider themselves innovators.
76

77
00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:16.220
What if it's the case that that's 
actually not my best audience?
77

78
00:04:16.230 --> 00:04:22.330
Their engagement rate is lower than another one and they don't click on my bio link as much. What if I should have been
78

79
00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:24.260
going after college students?
79

80
00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:31.830
I don't know, something else. What if I should go after people 
who follow DIY, crafts base, and lifestyle tips accounts?
80

81
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.250
I don't know, something else. What if I should go after people 
who follow DIY, crafts base, and lifestyle tips accounts?
81

82
00:04:33.430 --> 00:04:36.040
You can do that kind of testing on your dummy.
82

83
00:04:36.060 --> 00:04:41.790
So if you go to your dummy, what you can do is just 
follow a different account, try something else out, try
83

84
00:04:41.790 --> 00:04:48.200
a different type of person, try to find a person who 
matches the new profile and then use the "similar" one to
84

85
00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:52.920
look at some more accounts, or just go to one of the 
accounts that already has a follower base like that and
85

86
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:57.660
try just following that, and then post the same exact 
posts and see what the engagement rate is.
86

87
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:04.500
This is a process that we do over time, and I will show you 
follow alongs as I do some of this testing and tweaking,
87

88
00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:10.490
but what it allows us to do is it allows us to experiment 
and try out different things, and you wouldn't be able to
88

89
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:11.800
get away with that in your main account,
89

90
00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:17.880
or you'd take a negative ding, or you'd lose 
followers if you tried to do it on the official one.
90

91
00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:24.140
So we use it as kind of a building platform, we tinker around 
here, whatever worked we throw in the actual good one.
91

92
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:24.780
So we use it as kind of a building platform, we tinker around 
here, whatever worked we throw in the actual good one.
92

93
00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:29.420
Okay, so hopefully that gives you a little bit more insight into 
how you should use your dummy accounts and build them into
93

94
00:05:29.420 --> 00:05:30.520
your habits.
94

95
00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:35.960
If it doesn't really click for you, that's fine, just watch some of the follow alongs where you'll see me doing it, up to you if you want to
95

96
00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:41.300
do it. Again, it's up to you guys if you want to optimize 
your account to the fullest or you just want, you
96

97
00:05:41.490 --> 00:05:47.040
know, kind of a tweak to make it better. I personally suggest doing this, but it just depends on your commitment. Alright guys, that's enough about dummy accounts,
97

98
00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:49.260
next lecture we're going to have a 
quick one on curation. See you then.
98

99
00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.000
next lecture we're going to have a 
quick one on curation. See you then.
