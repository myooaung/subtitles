00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:00,830
Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:01,620
Hey guys, welcome back.
2

3
00:00:01,660 --> 00:00:09,170
OK, let's talk about how, if you don't have something
you can automatically use your profile photo,
3

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,390
how can you get a professional profile photo done.
4

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:13,910
OK.
5

6
00:00:13,950 --> 00:00:17,160
It's going to depend on obviously
what type of account you are, right?
6

7
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:21,790
If you're a themed account or a business account,
then it's a question of "Do you have a logo?"
7

8
00:00:21,810 --> 00:00:22,680
If you don't have a logo, we'll talk about that in a second.
8

9
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,200
If you don't have a logo, we'll talk about that in a second.
9

10
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:25,870
If you're a personal account,
10

11
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:28,980
well, this one's pretty easy, it just needs to be your face.
11

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,050
I mean, it's going to be your face, up here,
like, minimize the shoulders and body.
12

13
00:00:33,050 --> 00:00:37,120
So what you need is a headshot. Options with that one,
13

14
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,310
it kind of varies. A lot of times, if you
want to be cheap about it,
14

15
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:45,090
you don't want to spend any money, you
can just find a friend who has a DSLR,
15

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,450
that's a pretty good one.
16

17
00:00:46,560 --> 00:00:53,460
I would strongly suggest that whenever you take a photo
for a headshot, you get as far away from the background
17

18
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:59,430
as possible, because then what they can do is they
can just blur out the back using that bokeh kind of
18

19
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:02,480
effect, that works fine, right?
19

20
00:01:02,490 --> 00:01:07,320
Because we talked about having not
too much noise in the background,
20

21
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:09,940
that's pretty important, so that
people can focus on your face.
21

22
00:01:10,260 --> 00:01:16,530
Ideally, if you have lights, then stand up in front of like a white sheet of paper, or a white sheet, that helps, again, quite a bit.
22

23
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:18,120
Ideally, if you have lights, then stand up in front of like a white sheet of paper, or a white sheet, that helps, again, quite a bit.
23

24
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:21,450
You have to do a little bit of post-production after that
just to brighten up the back, but that's pretty easy.
24

25
00:01:21,450 --> 00:01:23,370
You have to do a little bit of post-production after that
just to brighten up the back, but that's pretty easy.
25

26
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:28,440
Now, if you want to spend a little bit of money, what
you can do is you can actually hire someone to take
26

27
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:32,940
your photograph, or you can rent
a nice camera and do it that way.
27

28
00:01:32,940 --> 00:01:35,250
Renting a camera is probably like the middle option.
28

29
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,880
I've done this before.
29

30
00:01:37,290 --> 00:01:44,310
The best camera I can think of for doing something
like this is, the one I used was a Sony A7R2,
30

31
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,700
it used to be a kind of expensive camera, not anymore,
31

32
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:48,100
it used to be a kind of expensive camera, not anymore,
32

33
00:01:48,150 --> 00:01:50,310
you can rent it for like $40 a day.
33

34
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,650
It's one of those cameras that's so nice that
it's really hard to take a bad photograph with it.
34

35
00:01:55,650 --> 00:01:59,150
All you have to do is just kind of hold it down
or get somebody to hold it down for you.
35

36
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,980
You can even do timed shots with it.
36

37
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,110
The resolution is insanely high, and it always
comes out like a really sharp picture.
37

38
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:09,650
So that's one way of doing it.
38

39
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:15,120
If you want to rent something like that, if you guys
are in the US, there's a website called CameraLends,
39

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:16,500
If you want to rent something like that, if you guys
are in the US, there's a website called CameraLends,
40

41
00:02:16,520 --> 00:02:18,770
that's probably the cheapest way you can do it.
41

42
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:24,360
Other than that, if you want hire a professional, you can
use, in my experience, Thumbtack is actually pretty good.
42

43
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:24,810
Other than that, if you want hire a professional, you can
use, in my experience, Thumbtack is actually pretty good.
43

44
00:02:24,810 --> 00:02:30,640
The headshots that I have, that you see on Udemy
and everywhere, I used Thumbtack for that.
44

45
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:37,490
And then also, you can... Craigslist, a lot of times
they list, people list that they're offering headshots,
45

46
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:40,390
if you go to Craigslist and look in the services section.
46

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:44,560
There's even places that will do mobile headshots, they'll
come to you, they have a van you go in and take the photo.
47

48
00:02:44,550 --> 00:02:45,680
There's even places that will do mobile headshots, they'll
come to you, they have a van you go in and take the photo.
48

49
00:02:45,720 --> 00:02:50,790
There's even places where they just have a permanent setup
and you walk in and they take your shot and move on.
49

50
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:52,240
There's even places where they just have a permanent setup
and you walk in and they take your shot and move on.
50

51
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,640
Those places are actually pretty cheap, relatively.
51

52
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:59,500
You know, I think there's a place like here in San
Francisco, and this is San Francisco, and it's $100.
52

53
00:02:59,520 --> 00:03:00,000
You know, I think there's a place like here in San
Francisco, and this is San Francisco, and it's $100.
53

54
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,690
So you just go in, and you're in and out in like 30 minutes.
54

55
00:03:02,790 --> 00:03:06,070
That's how you get a decent shot,
especially for a personal account.
55

56
00:03:06,210 --> 00:03:07,640
That's really all you need.
56

57
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:15,420
Now, if you're making a corporate account, like a logo
or a themed one, again, it's going to depend on like,
57

58
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:16,780
do you want to spend money?
58

59
00:03:17,070 --> 00:03:19,110
Cheap, free options, there's not a ton.
59

60
00:03:19,230 --> 00:03:20,090
Cheap, free options, there's not a ton.
60

61
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,130
I mean, one, you could hack it out yourself.
61

62
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,490
You can use like Photoshop and just do it yourself.
62

63
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,840
There's some free logo generators out there,
63

64
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:34,890
they're not particularly great. If that's the case, what
I'd strongly suggest is just taking the text from
64

65
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:40,770
your name and then just trying to stylize that. If
you're new to graphic design, then it's going to be
65

66
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:48,550
really way too hard and a large waste of time to
learn how to actually design a symbol for a logo.
66

67
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:54,660
So, again, just use text and try to
position it, just try to go through fonts.
67

68
00:03:54,660 --> 00:03:59,460
That's usually relatively easy to do, and sometimes
you can come out with a good outcome.
68

69
00:03:59,460 --> 00:04:01,530
There's some other websites that are worth looking at,
69

70
00:04:01,530 --> 00:04:06,600
if you can spend a little bit of money for a logo. This is one
website you should probably be familiar with, it's Fiverr.
70

71
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:07,800
if you can spend a little bit of money for a logo. This is one
website you should probably be familiar with, it's Fiverr.
71

72
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:15,160
The whole concept here is that you can get something
done for $5, so you can just look for logo design.
72

73
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:21,780
Usually, they're a little bit more than $5, so you can pay
more to have more versions made, you pay more
73

74
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:24,300
to, you know, give them instructions on the logo.
74

75
00:04:24,300 --> 00:04:29,630
Sometimes they're just templates, but usually,
you know, they have some pretty decent ones.
75

76
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,640
You just have to make a decision about what you want,
76

77
00:04:31,650 --> 00:04:36,930
you know, if you want something that's modern or do
you want something that's casual and fun. And you
77

78
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:44,100
can tell that a lot of these logo makers are pretty good, so like
here, you can literally pay $5 and they'll give you three.
78

79
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:46,840
can tell that a lot of these logo makers are pretty good, so like
here, you can literally pay $5 and they'll give you three.
79

80
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:47,670
Yeah.
80

81
00:04:47,670 --> 00:04:54,770
So this is fine if you want to wait or can wait 4-5
days, it usually ends up being pretty cheap.
81

82
00:04:54,990 --> 00:05:01,760
Here's one that personally I actually
love, and it's called ShapeFactory.
82

83
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:08,990
So what they've done is they've made a generator for
creating logos, and it's actually really good, especially
83

84
00:05:08,990 --> 00:05:14,930
for Instagram, like the way that they compile them based
on whatever text you give them is incredibly good.
84

85
00:05:14,930 --> 00:05:15,450
for Instagram, like the way that they compile them based
on whatever text you give them is incredibly good.
85

86
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:21,860
I mean, this is something that I will probably use for any
other, like, copy accounts or dummy accounts in the future,
86

87
00:05:21,860 --> 00:05:22,490
I mean, this is something that I will probably use for any
other, like, copy accounts or dummy accounts in the future,
87

88
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:25,940
especially later in the course, we'll start talking about
creating zombies, and that's probably what I'll use.
88

89
00:05:25,940 --> 00:05:26,680
especially later in the course, we'll start talking about
creating zombies, and that's probably what I'll use.
89

90
00:05:26,690 --> 00:05:29,220
So what you do is just go to logo.shapefactory.co,
90

91
00:05:29,270 --> 00:05:33,880
and hopefully when you guys go to this it's actually up,
because you never know with some of these newer
91

92
00:05:33,890 --> 00:05:43,570
tools. So you just type in your account name,
so mine might be like, you know, innovation a day,
92

93
00:05:46,930 --> 00:05:53,460
and then what you do is you just pick a text,
then you pick your logo mark, and then it gives
93

94
00:05:53,460 --> 00:06:02,650
you different variations. So I might do
something like clean, like that, sans serif
94

95
00:06:02,670 --> 00:06:05,420
meaning it doesn't have the little
hooks at the end of each letter.
95

96
00:06:05,420 --> 00:06:07,050
meaning it doesn't have the little
hooks at the end of each letter.
96

97
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:10,620
Then what you can do is you can
pick a category for your logo.
97

98
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:14,470
It doesn't really matter, I mean, you can
just search up here for something too.
98

99
00:06:14,470 --> 00:06:16,450
So mine's innovation, right?
99

100
00:06:16,500 --> 00:06:16,820
So mine's innovation, right?
100

101
00:06:16,830 --> 00:06:19,940
So I might go down here to, like, beaker,
101

102
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:26,210
because science is just an easy association with innovation.
102

103
00:06:26,610 --> 00:06:35,090
So I could probably... Just pick
something that kind of fits your style.
103

104
00:06:36,660 --> 00:06:37,430
OK.
104

105
00:06:37,600 --> 00:06:42,040
So there you go, and then it just
pumps this out for you right there.
105

106
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:47,110
And it gives you different variations, different shapes that
you can work with, and it even gives you color variations.
106

107
00:06:47,260 --> 00:06:48,780
And it gives you different variations, different shapes that
you can work with, and it even gives you color variations.
107

108
00:06:48,970 --> 00:06:50,910
So this is actually a really fun one to play with.
108

109
00:06:50,910 --> 00:06:53,160
It's, at the end of the day, it's only $40,
so honestly I think it's worth it.
109

110
00:06:53,260 --> 00:06:56,370
It's, at the end of the day, it's only $40,
so honestly I think it's worth it.
110

111
00:06:56,390 --> 00:07:01,670
All their icons are really good, their text is good, and
I'm surprised sometimes I've come out with logos in
111

112
00:07:01,670 --> 00:07:04,780
this that I like more than the logos I paid $1,000 for. So
one other option I think worth looking into is 99designs.
112

113
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:11,230
this that I like more than the logos I paid $1,000 for. So
one other option I think worth looking into is 99designs.
113

114
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:16,510
Now, this is if you're ok spending a lot of money
and you're actually serious, especially if you needed
114

115
00:07:16,510 --> 00:07:19,050
a logo anyway and it's a legitimate business.
115

116
00:07:19,090 --> 00:07:26,020
Well, what happens here is it's a contest website, so
basically you go and you'll give a description, what
116

117
00:07:26,020 --> 00:07:29,560
you want, and it'll ask you questions, it's like a
questionnaire, you don't have to come up with all the
117

118
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:34,830
stuff in your head, it gives you these sliders
you can pick from for aesthetic styles,
118

119
00:07:35,020 --> 00:07:40,150
and then it tells you to show them
what types of logos you like,
119

120
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:46,180
and then over time people just compete on them,
so you'll actually end up seeing anywhere from 20 to
120

121
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:52,330
100 different logo variations, and you rate them, and
it kind of goes through this trial process, and then
121

122
00:07:52,330 --> 00:07:56,950
usually around, you know, 7-10 days later,
you have something you want.
122

123
00:07:56,950 --> 00:08:03,430
I also like the fact that it's not something
that you absolutely have to commit to.
123

124
00:08:03,430 --> 00:08:11,110
So if you don't like what you got, you
don't actually have to purchase it.
124

125
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,060
So yeah.
125

126
00:08:12,310 --> 00:08:16,420
You can go down here and it gives
you a lot of ideas that you can use.
126

127
00:08:16,780 --> 00:08:19,710
That's kind of the view of the slider
127

128
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:27,950
you use to decide, then you can even go and look at
other people's logos and see how it goes. Typically,
128

129
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:31,070
I think for a logo the range is $300.
129

130
00:08:31,090 --> 00:08:35,550
You can pay up to whatever you
want, really, but $300 is the lowest.
130

131
00:08:35,590 --> 00:08:38,340
I think the most common you'll see is probably $500,
131

132
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:44,020
especially if you need them to do a logo plus something, like
a little bit of branding work, especially for, like, Instagram.
132

133
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,380
especially if you need them to do a logo plus something, like
a little bit of branding work, especially for, like, Instagram.
133

134
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:54,130
This actually might be what I'll end up doing for the
Instagram accounts, just because I'm not super oriented
134

135
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,900
towards design, so it would help to have someone
do the logo, but then also help with the way that it's
135

136
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:03,180
going to be positioned on each individual photo,
136

137
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:05,280
so I think that would help a lot.
137

138
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:12,280
I haven't entirely decided what I want to do yet, but you
can see those in the follow along lectures as we go.
138

139
00:09:12,310 --> 00:09:13,740
I haven't entirely decided what I want to do yet, but you
can see those in the follow along lectures as we go.
139

140
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:14,880
You'll see what I picked.
140

141
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:15,220
OK.
141

142
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:17,530
I think that's pretty much all you need to know.
142

143
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:25,750
Again, if you need a headshot for a personal account,
pretty easy, there's usually headshot studios in whatever
143

144
00:09:25,750 --> 00:09:30,100
city you're in. If not, use any platform,
144

145
00:09:30,150 --> 00:09:34,280
you can just just hire someone directly
on it to take your photographs.
145

146
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:36,930
If you want to do it cheaply, just
get a friend who has a DSLR.
146

147
00:09:36,940 --> 00:09:43,130
I mean, you can even use your iPhone if it's a newer
one, because the camera is actually decent enough,
147

148
00:09:43,150 --> 00:09:45,670
especially with the newest ones with the portrait mode.
148

149
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:47,300
That's one way of doing it.
149

150
00:09:47,290 --> 00:09:51,160
And if you're really lazy, you could just take a photo
you have and then run it through Instagram and
150

151
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:56,290
use their filters and kind of screw with it that way
to make it a little more like stylized. I don't obviously
151

152
00:09:56,320 --> 00:10:00,500
suggests that, but if you need to get something
done today, that's one way of doing it.
152

153
00:10:00,580 --> 00:10:07,270
And then, if you need a corporate account, so a logo
for a corporate account or a themed account, I like
153

154
00:10:07,270 --> 00:10:12,520
ShapeFactory, I like Fiverr for this,
and I think 99designs works as well.
154

155
00:10:12,520 --> 00:10:19,200
One other one, I would say, if you just want to hire
one specific designer or one person, Dribbble is
155

156
00:10:19,210 --> 00:10:24,580
a good one, it's Dribbble with three Bs, and you
can just go and look at all the different stuff they
156

157
00:10:24,580 --> 00:10:29,690
have, and just find someone you like and
then just message them through the system.
157

158
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:34,490
This is how actually I find a lot of designers, because
they just post little snippets of cool stuff.
158

159
00:10:34,540 --> 00:10:35,050
I see it, I love that style, then I message
them, and that's how we figure it out.
159

160
00:10:35,050 --> 00:10:37,750
I see it, I love that style, then I message
them, and that's how we figure it out.
160

161
00:10:37,750 --> 00:10:39,340
All right, guys. I will see you in the next lecture.
