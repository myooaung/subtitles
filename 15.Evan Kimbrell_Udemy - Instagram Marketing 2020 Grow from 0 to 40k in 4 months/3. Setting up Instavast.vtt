00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:01.650
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:08.550
OK so this lecture we're going to jump into one of the user interfaces to explore and explain a little

3
00:00:08.550 --> 00:00:13.920
bit about how they work what settings you have available to you and how for instance like they're targeting

4
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:14.220
works.

5
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:19.380
Now we chose Amsterdam just because I think it is the probably the most popular with the students because

6
00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:23.760
it's the cheapest and it has the best ratio of features to cost.

7
00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:25.350
So that's what we're going to do.

8
00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.020
I didn't want to do something like boost and then no one else wants to spend 50 bucks a month.

9
00:00:30.030 --> 00:00:30.400
So.

10
00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:32.760
OK good answer Ask.com if you want follow along.

11
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:34.580
Otherwise try a different one.

12
00:00:34.630 --> 00:00:35.520
You are welcome to.

13
00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.060
So we're going to start our free three day trial.

14
00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:38.460
Right.

15
00:00:38.460 --> 00:00:39.810
You we need to sign up

16
00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:46.670
accept their terms and policies blah blah blah.

17
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:51.970
All right so then it pops up into some words of wisdom which are actually kind of helpful.

18
00:00:51.980 --> 00:00:57.180
All they're saying here is that make sure that your e-mails confirms that because if it's not confirmed

19
00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.350
with Instagram so for instance if you didn't do the switch to a business profile and it forces you to

20
00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:04.390
confirm it then this whole thing will work.

21
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:07.340
Then it's also important that you bind your instagram your Facebook page.

22
00:01:07.340 --> 00:01:11.920
We talked about that before but protecting your account you do that because if you get locked out Facebook's

23
00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:17.670
The only way back in uploading an avatar they just probably think they're talking about your profile

24
00:01:17.670 --> 00:01:21.090
here so they want to make sure that you have at least six photos and an avatar.

25
00:01:21.090 --> 00:01:26.310
Otherwise it looks like your a blank account trying to get people's attention and that just doesn't

26
00:01:26.310 --> 00:01:26.900
work.

27
00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:30.030
OK so then enter our Instagram account name.

28
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:35.390
So I'm actually just going to sign up with the main account as well.

29
00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:42.120
And then the and and then right here it says use proxy for this account.

30
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.350
Now what is a proxy.

31
00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:47.610
We'll talk about this more and we start doing zombies but a proxy basically means that it gives it's

32
00:01:47.700 --> 00:01:50.710
a account a different IP address than the one you're using.

33
00:01:50.730 --> 00:01:53.220
Now what's the problem if you don't use a proxy.

34
00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:58.140
If you're making a lot of accounts and you manage a bunch of them and they're all using the same IP

35
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:03.030
address then it's going to look like to Instagram that one person is just coordinating all of these

36
00:02:03.030 --> 00:02:04.580
accounts which is true.

37
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.910
But they kind of randomly change their mind about how they feel about that.

38
00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.860
And so you're not really protecting yourself so sometimes it can happen is one of them will flag and

39
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:17.990
it'll flag all the ones that have also touched the IP address associated with it.

40
00:02:18.150 --> 00:02:21.440
If you want to add a proxy you just do this and then you put this.

41
00:02:21.450 --> 00:02:22.940
And we'll talk about this later.

42
00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.880
Otherwise just hit an account.

43
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:25.570
OK.

44
00:02:25.590 --> 00:02:26.700
So here we are.

45
00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:33.600
And it warns me that I need to pay for it which probably will actually end up doing to use it.

46
00:02:33.660 --> 00:02:36.500
OK so you actually have a lot going on here.

47
00:02:36.540 --> 00:02:39.030
It can be a little overwhelming at first.

48
00:02:39.030 --> 00:02:46.530
So down here they just have some default accounts that you can view this is somewhat helpful to see

49
00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.380
how it works.

50
00:02:48.450 --> 00:02:53.110
And so what basically happens is you're going to add accounts are targets.

51
00:02:53.130 --> 00:02:58.520
You can either add a hash tag or an account and then it allow you to do lights comments and follows.

52
00:02:58.530 --> 00:03:02.340
And if you don't want them to do that to that account you just make sure to turn these off.

53
00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:06.030
In fact actually just delete them if you want to you then they get something called scamped and that

54
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:10.980
just means that they're going to be looking for certain things and people to follow or comment on and

55
00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:12.940
they don't find it they just skip it.

56
00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.090
OK so typically the way you do this would just be to hit new target OK.

57
00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:24.640
And then we would want to add a competitor a location a hash tag or multiple ones.

58
00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.220
Somebody try to hash tag one first because I know that innovation that hash tag seems to be a pretty

59
00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.450
good one for me.

60
00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.150
I don't yet have a perfect competitor.

61
00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:36.750
There are some ones out there but I want to do a little more analysis to figure out which ones have

62
00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:42.540
higher engagement rates because I don't want to go after the followers of an account that's mostly these

63
00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:45.600
mass followers or people that made an account then forgot about it.

64
00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:47.790
So you figure it goes post-dinner post lover.

65
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:50.100
Now what this means is post owner.

66
00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:55.560
That means it's going to target the people who post things like the actual photo in that hash tag and

67
00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:00.460
use that hash tag post lovers or the people that like those photos or comment on them.

68
00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.460
For us we probably want the post lovers because those people are checking out the hash tag they're interested

69
00:04:05.550 --> 00:04:06.630
in it and they like it.

70
00:04:06.630 --> 00:04:10.890
These are just going to larger accounts most likely I don't really care about interacting with some

71
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:14.620
of the accounts that are also trying to grow they're following and they're just like a business account

72
00:04:14.620 --> 00:04:16.310
so Olmedo posts lovers.

73
00:04:16.350 --> 00:04:18.150
Now what I'm gonna do is innovation.

74
00:04:18.560 --> 00:04:20.030
OK so target.

75
00:04:20.310 --> 00:04:25.530
OK so now down here we have it we have liked comments follows and scamped and then coverage is just

76
00:04:26.070 --> 00:04:29.720
how many of the people that like that did it actually get to.

77
00:04:29.730 --> 00:04:35.220
And then conversion rate this is actually really useful it seems after it follows someone comments on

78
00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:38.210
someone do they come back and do the same to you or follow you.

79
00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:38.450
Right.

80
00:04:38.470 --> 00:04:41.970
So that's actually a pretty useful metric and that's one reason to check in frequently.

81
00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.510
So if I try this it turns out my conversion is just terrible.

82
00:04:44.700 --> 00:04:50.010
Well then chances are I should probably stop doing that where you can do is put in multiple ones and

83
00:04:50.010 --> 00:04:53.320
then kind of test both to see how that works.

84
00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.440
So if I wanted to get rid of these because I'm not trying to go after those I get on another target

85
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.030
and I could pick another hashtag so maybe Futurism OK it's smaller hash tag number innovation was a

86
00:05:06.030 --> 00:05:06.780
big one.

87
00:05:06.780 --> 00:05:09.190
Futurism was a mid-size.

88
00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:12.760
So kind of what I'm going for this is maybe it's smaller so I can get more attention.

89
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:19.380
So you can see it's 171 thousand posts so maybe people are falling small hashtags are probably more

90
00:05:19.380 --> 00:05:21.570
engaged but also Futurism.

91
00:05:21.810 --> 00:05:24.700
That's a little more specific than just bland innovation.

92
00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:26.380
So we'll try that.

93
00:05:26.650 --> 00:05:27.020
OK.

94
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:27.580
There we go.

95
00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:32.240
Now like I said before I don't want to comments I just personally don't like them.

96
00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:33.240
Do you want to try them.

97
00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.430
You can't say I left you.

98
00:05:34.440 --> 00:05:37.910
Sometimes what they do is they just posted a Mogi on someone's account.

99
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:42.540
And if you look in my account you can see some we can notice that some of these accounts are doing that

100
00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:43.520
to us.

101
00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:45.060
So I just turn off comments.

102
00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:46.110
I just think it's weird.

103
00:05:46.110 --> 00:05:49.070
Personally I'm going to leave it up to just doing these.

104
00:05:49.110 --> 00:05:49.560
OK.

105
00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.120
Now up here we have some sorting.

106
00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:56.520
So if you do a lot of different targeting then you can put a whole bunch of them and then start sorting

107
00:05:56.520 --> 00:06:00.810
by whatever and then decide which one works.

108
00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:05.510
So for instance I can start by status and that would just be you know maybe I have a bunch of these.

109
00:06:05.510 --> 00:06:07.320
I paused and not really using them.

110
00:06:07.320 --> 00:06:10.320
So then the question just becomes maybe I can review them.

111
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:14.950
So I look for all my paw's ones I really want to bring back some sort of my deleted ones whatever.

112
00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:17.880
Up here is a pretty quick one if you want to pause your entire thing.

113
00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.340
You can hit that if you start your entire thing you can hit that.

114
00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:23.090
Now over here we have a post section.

115
00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:23.750
OK.

116
00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:27.560
And it wants you to verify your time zone and verify that.

117
00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.130
Sure.

118
00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:35.990
That helps with their processing and then it shows to post that I have now for one two I can click these

119
00:06:36.890 --> 00:06:39.980
and it'll give me a little more of a run down on it.

120
00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:46.160
But I mean this is not why we're using this software.

121
00:06:46.320 --> 00:06:52.150
So it just gives me the kind of basic thing you'd expect from really anything over here I can see scheduled

122
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.460
posts.

123
00:06:53.790 --> 00:06:59.040
And here I have draft posts so it's going to pull these freezing buffer or later Graham it's going to

124
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.000
notice and it's going to actually put them here and draft post that happens when you're filling something

125
00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.240
out and trying to exit out and ask you if you want to save it as a draft post.

126
00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:07.890
Now the other thing our comments here.

127
00:07:07.890 --> 00:07:12.840
You see this everywhere and honestly we just use iconic square or later Graham to do this so we can

128
00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:15.050
actually go and respond to these people.

129
00:07:15.210 --> 00:07:17.960
And that's actually pretty useful.

130
00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:20.270
But I'm not going to use their system for this.

131
00:07:20.270 --> 00:07:21.730
This is just not what I'm interested in.

132
00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.340
Now the last thing is they're direct.

133
00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.610
Now what happens with direct is that when someone calls you you can send them a direct message.

134
00:07:27.630 --> 00:07:28.420
That's it.

135
00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:32.610
Anybody who's going on Twitter or Instagram knows where he falls among a lot of times they'll send you

136
00:07:32.610 --> 00:07:38.370
an auto direct message sometimes you know that works the problem with this is that it's so saturated

137
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:40.500
that people don't even notice it anymore.

138
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:43.780
If they follow you I don't know if they read it right.

139
00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:45.810
But it's sometimes it's worth a shot.

140
00:07:45.810 --> 00:07:47.480
I mean that's my kind of attitude towards it.

141
00:07:47.490 --> 00:07:49.040
Will it convert a lot of people.

142
00:07:49.110 --> 00:07:50.110
I don't know.

143
00:07:50.130 --> 00:07:52.530
You can try different settings here too.

144
00:07:52.530 --> 00:07:55.430
It's really hard to test out what works though.

145
00:07:55.470 --> 00:07:57.170
So we don't really know.

146
00:07:57.210 --> 00:08:01.530
Typically a good message would be something that sounds like an individual actually sit in on a robot

147
00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.610
and then gives them some reason why to keep coming back to your account.

148
00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:12.390
So my account if I do live videos every month for a giveaway I'd say that in my direct message is remind

149
00:08:12.390 --> 00:08:15.170
them on the first of every month that you live giveaways.

150
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:19.560
And if I do stories I'd say top three innovations every day at this time.

151
00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:21.090
So that might actually be useful.

152
00:08:21.090 --> 00:08:22.560
All right so that is honestly it.

153
00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:23.620
I mean there's not a lot to it.

154
00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:29.130
That's why this one is so cheap here you can go to statistics if you want to and it will give you some

155
00:08:29.130 --> 00:08:31.710
statistics about how your campaign is going.

156
00:08:31.710 --> 00:08:37.250
You'll get like percentage averages you'll get coverage dates you'll get all sorts of random stuff.

157
00:08:37.290 --> 00:08:39.110
OK so that's pretty much the bare bones.

158
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:39.690
That's it.

159
00:08:39.690 --> 00:08:45.810
Now that I have added some promotional ones right here I can pause them or turn them back on and it

160
00:08:45.810 --> 00:08:51.750
will actually just start going OK if you check back in in a day you'll notice that these numbers will

161
00:08:51.750 --> 00:08:53.310
just start going up randomly.

162
00:08:53.310 --> 00:08:58.530
So tinker around with it make sure that your Chun-Li checking that conversion rate so that you are getting

163
00:08:58.530 --> 00:09:04.810
the most out of your 400 or 300 interactions per day and make sure that you're trying to cycle these

164
