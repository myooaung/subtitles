00:00:00,170 --> 00:00:01,580
Hey Hey welcome back.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:08,010
OK this lecture we're going to do is talk about how you can get a phone number to use for verifying

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:10,810
your account how to do that relatively easy.

4
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:12,170
Now I might show you two different ways.

5
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,100
One is using a app called burner just on both Android and iPhone.

6
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,150
And the other one is a web app called next IMHO.

7
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:22,830
Now there's a lot of other ways you can do this right.

8
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,160
If you guys find a better way of doing it definitely go for it and post in the group discussion that

9
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:26,850
you found it.

10
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,510
But this works for me at the moment.

11
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,990
So the first one is called burner.

12
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:32,870
Now it's just an app on your phone.

13
00:00:32,870 --> 00:00:38,040
So would go to Berner OK and it looks like this.

14
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:43,560
Now the idea behind this system is that you can create a lot of burner phone numbers in a burner if

15
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:48,480
you're not familiar with that term is usually first like a burner phone someone or when you would buy

16
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,390
a phone and then use it for one specific thing and then burn it essentially get rid of it.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:56,770
That's not something that just spies use.

18
00:00:56,900 --> 00:00:58,650
There's a lot of legitimate uses for this.

19
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:01,340
My favorite use for using burner actually is Craigslist.

20
00:01:01,530 --> 00:01:05,820
Any time I sell something on Craigslist I'd like to use a burner phone number so that it doesn't get

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:08,300
passed around a million random people.

22
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,950
And it's also easy for me to just burn it and delete it when I don't want to see messages about my item

23
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:14,330
any more.

24
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:15,150
Like when it sells.

25
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:18,690
But for our purposes it's also quite useful as well.

26
00:01:18,690 --> 00:01:22,800
So what you want to do with download the app and you'll probably see a home screen that's a little bit

27
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:23,530
different.

28
00:01:23,540 --> 00:01:25,140
It's all kind of works the exact same.

29
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:31,470
So for me I just kind of go up to this hamburger sandwich at the top and go to create a burner.

30
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:36,270
Now it gives you a bunch of options and it's a credit system so you have to buy credits from them in

31
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:37,780
order to set something up.

32
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:41,280
Like I said this is the easy way of getting a phone number it's not the cheap way.

33
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:42,390
You have a picture burner.

34
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,060
Unlimited standard text only mini burner.

35
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:51,480
Now we only need text messages and I can't imagine that we're going to need so many text messages that

36
00:01:51,480 --> 00:01:54,900
we're going to be constantly reconfirming our account.

37
00:01:54,900 --> 00:01:58,710
That's why I just go with the mini burner because it's only three credits and I think three credits

38
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:00,900
Italiens of being like a couple dollars.

39
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:05,550
So I would say I want the mini burner at three credits then I can enter a name.

40
00:02:05,550 --> 00:02:06,720
This is just for your reference.

41
00:02:06,720 --> 00:02:07,710
It doesn't matter.

42
00:02:07,710 --> 00:02:13,920
I like to use a sweet keyboard to go like this until it comes out with a random word Yemenite cure and

43
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,000
then enter in an area code it doesn't really matter.

44
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,580
Just pick any three random numbers.

45
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:21,930
They're all going to be U.S. based.

46
00:02:21,930 --> 00:02:25,980
The next thing we do is next mo and those you can use international numbers if there's some reason that's

47
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,950
important to you.

48
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:29,600
But I can just say to an 8.

49
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:32,080
OK now here's a list of numbers.

50
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:35,430
So pick one that you like let's say 2 8 2 0 8.

51
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:38,110
OK and once cost me three credits.

52
00:02:38,550 --> 00:02:38,890
OK.

53
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:40,750
Now we have a new one.

54
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:43,410
I ignore all of these settings because none of this matters.

55
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:49,100
I just want to use it to get text messages so Yemenite is right here and has our number up at the top

56
00:02:49,110 --> 00:02:50,060
case you forget it.

57
00:02:50,070 --> 00:02:54,070
Now what I can do is take this number put it into our account.

58
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:01,810
So that's 2 1 8 0 8 2 1 5 and then Snit.

59
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:02,520
OK.

60
00:03:02,550 --> 00:03:08,610
Now I didn't create my account with the phone number so it doesn't actually need to verify it with me

61
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:09,430
right now.

62
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:15,510
But if you create your accounts from the beginning using a phone number don't e-mail address it will

63
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:18,090
actually text messaged you to make sure that's a real phone number.

64
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:22,440
Now it might feel like why do we do all this set up get ready to receive these text messages.

65
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:27,600
Well because later on they will definitely ask you to verify it as soon as you start posting soon as

66
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:31,710
you do anything that might potentially look like it's automated.

67
00:03:31,710 --> 00:03:34,470
They will start asking you this.

68
00:03:34,530 --> 00:03:38,300
So it's easy to just whip open your burner app and do it right there.

69
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,650
And the other way of doing this is an app called Nexus now.

70
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:48,930
Now next mo is it's just what's called an API platform for Vonage which is just kind of the old school

71
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:56,670
version of Skype Skype for Skype and it allows you to kind of set up phone numbers and I think the idea

72
00:03:56,670 --> 00:04:03,150
is it's for developers because they can use these phone numbers plus some programming to integrate phone

73
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,860
numbers like text messaging or auto phone calls and stuff like that into apps.

74
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:12,570
If you've ever used an app that sends you a text message at any given point you know what I'm talking

75
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:16,950
about every time you sign up for Uber it will text message you and and you send it back a code to figure

76
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:18,310
out that you're actually a human.

77
00:04:18,330 --> 00:04:20,470
They use a platform very much like this.

78
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:22,020
OK so go ahead and sign up.

79
00:04:22,020 --> 00:04:23,390
I don't need to show you the sign up screen.

80
00:04:23,390 --> 00:04:25,420
It's pretty standard.

81
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:29,250
Once you sign up you'll find it Administration dashboard kind of like this.

82
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:32,540
Mean it's a whole bunch of gobbledygook that's not relevant to us.

83
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:35,730
We're just going to using it for one very specific purpose.

84
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:41,350
Now over here on the left we have a section that says numbers and this is literally all we care about.

85
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,200
You guys could go ahead and build applications on us to make your job your life easier but this is just

86
00:04:46,290 --> 00:04:47,490
not important to us.

87
00:04:47,640 --> 00:04:49,870
So we got to numbers and go to your numbers.

88
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:52,940
And for me I already have numbers so it shows me some.

89
00:04:52,950 --> 00:04:55,930
But if you guys don't have numbers you won't see anything here at all.

90
00:04:55,950 --> 00:05:01,410
You want to do those go down to by numbers and right here you can select whatever country you want.

91
00:05:01,410 --> 00:05:05,840
You know if you create an account outside of the U.S. and rever it would make sense have a phone number

92
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:07,450
that's from where you are.

93
00:05:07,530 --> 00:05:10,430
So the next thing says features s.m.m voice and voice.

94
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,100
Well you want either s m s or ESMA and voice doesn't really matter they cost the same amount.

95
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,930
Really we just want this so that we can verify our accounts.

96
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:21,870
Now type they kind of trick you here because they don't actually have any landlines.

97
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:23,280
They have mobile and they have toll free.

98
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:24,960
You don't toll free you want a mobile.

99
00:05:25,260 --> 00:05:25,530
OK.

100
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,650
Now here is where you could enter in a number for let's say if I want a specific area code I wanted

101
00:05:31,650 --> 00:05:37,330
one in Buffalo New York I'm pretty sure that's actually the US the area code for Buffalo New York.

102
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,180
But for me I don't really care right now so we just that search.

103
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,960
OK well I'll give you a jillion different options.

104
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:48,020
And the way this works is you pay them 67 euro cents.

105
00:05:48,020 --> 00:05:49,640
I think I said that correctly.

106
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:51,680
Per month per phone number.

107
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:51,950
Right.

108
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:58,880
So if you had 20 accounts you'll pay like I depends on the exchange rate but it's probably like $11

109
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:00,260
USD per month.

110
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:02,630
So this is pretty cheap.

111
00:06:02,630 --> 00:06:08,660
The burner was a little bit more I guess it's not necessarily monthly but they have expiration dates

112
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:13,490
so you have to keep remaking them unless you buy an auto renewing line in which case doesn't a monthly

113
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:14,460
charge.

114
00:06:14,480 --> 00:06:16,570
So we just pick one of these.

115
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:23,180
So I could say by now what it will usually do is I'll ask you to put money in your balance and the way

116
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:27,380
that you do that is you just go up here to balance and I already have nine euros in it.

117
00:06:27,380 --> 00:06:33,070
So what you can do is do it through pal or a card or whatever once you make a payment it automatically

118
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:34,070
add to your balance.

119
00:06:34,070 --> 00:06:35,030
You can do.

120
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:37,340
I think the lowest value is 10 bucks.

121
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:42,980
But again if you're doing the strategy you're going to want to at least do $10 so that you can have

122
00:06:42,980 --> 00:06:46,760
this one phone number re renew over and over again.

123
00:06:46,790 --> 00:06:49,230
So you go back to this and just click buy.

124
00:06:49,770 --> 00:06:50,080
OK.

125
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:56,360
Now that we have our buying we have it done now I'm good to my numbers and it's right there right at

126
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:56,930
the top.

127
00:06:56,930 --> 00:07:02,900
Now the way that we get our text messages from this it's a little dinky but hey it works.

128
00:07:02,900 --> 00:07:04,430
Take the number right here.

129
00:07:04,430 --> 00:07:05,270
Copy it.

130
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:13,430
So we want to do is go to amass over here and go to logs search messages and then right here we go search

131
00:07:13,430 --> 00:07:16,670
by recipient number and type in the number.

132
00:07:16,670 --> 00:07:19,180
Make sure it has the same date that you're on.

133
00:07:19,190 --> 00:07:23,690
And then you'll search and it should show you the text message.

134
00:07:23,690 --> 00:07:27,720
Now again I'm not using this on my account so we're not actually going to get a verify message.

135
00:07:27,740 --> 00:07:32,810
But you kind of get the drift right if you're signed up and you would say oh we sent you a text message

136
00:07:32,810 --> 00:07:38,090
please verify it you would give them this number and then you tell them scrammed send the code and you

137
00:07:38,090 --> 00:07:42,260
come here search for the log and then you'd find a verify code.

138
00:07:42,290 --> 00:07:44,490
That's a weird kind of work around but it works.

139
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:46,560
So can only knock it.

140
00:07:46,820 --> 00:07:49,990
OK so that's two different ways of getting a phone number.

141
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,150
This is something that you will want to upload to your account.

142
00:07:53,170 --> 00:08:00,830
It will give your account a higher security profile and Instagram has a tendency to constantly keep

143
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:04,520
checking to make you verify your phone number especially if you're doing anything that looks like a

144
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:06,680
bot or looks too automated.

145
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,710
I guarantee you this is the first time you've done this you'll run into that problem to make sure that

146
00:08:09,710 --> 00:08:13,120
you have this process set up at least somewhat.

147
00:08:13,130 --> 00:08:15,610
Hey guys the next lecture we will go over.

148
00:08:15,620 --> 00:08:20,660
How to make some logos and then how to put those into our Instagram account.

149
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:21,230
So you the.
