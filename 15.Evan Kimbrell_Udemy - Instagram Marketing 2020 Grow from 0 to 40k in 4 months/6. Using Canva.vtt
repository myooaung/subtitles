00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.360
Hey guys welcome back OK.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:08.850
This lecture we're going to go over a tool called Kanva and we're gonna explore how we can use it to

3
00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.370
create images for Instagram account.

4
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.450
Now I don't know if you use Kamba before but I think it's incredibly useful.

5
00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:20.350
It's a photo editing app that you can use in your browser.

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:25.750
They also have a mobile app version of it as well for iOS and Android.

7
00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:27.830
Similar functionality.

8
00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:32.990
I don't know if it has the exact same functionality as the web version but it's still pretty good.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.340
We're going to look at the web version right now.

10
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:36.990
That's how I prefer to do it.

11
00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:42.580
I personally like to make all of my graphics and content on the web but it's up to you guys.

12
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.790
We'll cover other apps later on that you can use on your phone on the go.

13
00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.990
That can be pretty convenient sometimes.

14
00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:50.970
OK so go to Kanva dot com.

15
00:00:50.970 --> 00:00:56.840
It's Kanva kind of like canvas but minus the S and it kind of just looks like this.

16
00:00:56.910 --> 00:00:59.750
So the app itself is completely free.

17
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:09.380
If you want to upgrade to add things like custom fonts or think it's clearly as fonts and setting a

18
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:15.540
brand like brand guidelines for colors things that just save you time then you can upgrade but it's

19
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.800
not really something that's expensive I think it's like $4 a month or something like that.

20
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:25.950
And that's if you find that you you need more than the free version anyway so go ahead and sign up and

21
00:01:26.040 --> 00:01:29.090
you'll eventually get your screen that looks like this.

22
00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:29.540
OK.

23
00:01:29.550 --> 00:01:37.390
So here over on the left it allows you to just see all of your designs designs that you shared.

24
00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:41.870
It allows you to create teams which is pretty helpful if you have other people who are making content.

25
00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.440
Then you can pay for one account and then they can borrow it as well and then you can do things like

26
00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:51.690
your brand if you're a pro count and then find templates down here you can see that I have a bunch of

27
00:01:51.690 --> 00:01:55.410
folders because I use Kanva for pretty much all of my courses.

28
00:01:55.410 --> 00:01:58.410
That's why one of the go to I'm going to use for Instagram.

29
00:01:58.410 --> 00:02:05.700
So the way that it works is you pick a type of posting and then you'll pick a form that will automatically

30
00:02:05.700 --> 00:02:15.630
give you a formatted canvas for you to just throw a bunch of templates images text icons really anything

31
00:02:15.630 --> 00:02:21.220
onto it and then they have these kind of drag and drop tools that allow you to edit things pretty easily.

32
00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:24.690
Once you make something it shows up kind of over here in this area.

33
00:02:24.690 --> 00:02:30.120
So if we wanted to make an Instagram post you wouldn't click Facebook obviously you wouldn't pick social

34
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.900
media because that's just generic.

35
00:02:32.040 --> 00:02:36.710
What you do is it more and then go down to Instagram post right here.

36
00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:41.400
Now the difference many Instagram posting other ones all this is Tenny by 10:08 which is perfect.

37
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:47.190
But also these ones are more generic and I'll show you how if you do end up getting stuck with a template

38
00:02:47.190 --> 00:02:52.230
or sizing you don't like there's some pretty cool tools for converting it to the size that you want

39
00:02:52.230 --> 00:02:53.160
on Instagram.

40
00:02:53.340 --> 00:02:54.180
OK so we've got that.

41
00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:55.380
And here we go.

42
00:02:55.530 --> 00:02:57.420
This is our image canvas.

43
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.120
And then it's pretty much up to us to fill with what we want.

44
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:02.750
So we'll start over here with layouts with layouts.

45
00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:08.730
They just give you templates and this is probably one of the fastest ways to put stuff together if you're

46
00:03:08.730 --> 00:03:10.980
doing motivational quotes on your account.

47
00:03:10.980 --> 00:03:15.090
For instance you could make something in Kanva in about five minutes.

48
00:03:15.090 --> 00:03:16.050
I mean it's crazy.

49
00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:22.460
I can just do this edit the quote throw in my logo and I'm done.

50
00:03:22.470 --> 00:03:26.020
And I don't know I think they would take me probably a minute.

51
00:03:26.250 --> 00:03:29.550
But what I think is really useful is just to go through these templates.

52
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:34.780
For me it's incredibly helpful to see something that pre-designed pre stylized.

53
00:03:35.010 --> 00:03:39.880
And then I can look at it and see how they did the visual composition.

54
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:44.280
I can also see what effects they did to get rid of the backgrounds in some situations.

55
00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:50.310
So like here it's a big text it's on your case is a very specific font and the white contrast with the

56
00:03:50.310 --> 00:03:51.010
red.

57
00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:52.350
That's pretty cool.

58
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.230
If you'd notice oftentimes these templates you can if you look at the way it's kind of laid out sometimes

59
00:03:58.230 --> 00:04:04.770
you can swap out photos that you have as long as it matches the same rough visual composition.

60
00:04:04.890 --> 00:04:05.640
So check these out.

61
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:10.430
They have literally like thousands and thousands of these.

62
00:04:10.440 --> 00:04:14.160
Eventually you'll get to the point where they have paid ones.

63
00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.870
But at the same time it's like a dollar each.

64
00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:21.000
I mean I don't think you'll ever even exhaust all of the free ones they have.

65
00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.750
There's so many so right there is just a huge win.

66
00:04:24.750 --> 00:04:28.340
I mean you could just just copy any of these.

67
00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:34.260
Tweak it a little bit to fit your thing and you're pretty much done as I use this all the time for inspiration

68
00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.850
just for oh it looks cool.

69
00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:37.770
Never kind of thought of putting it that way.

70
00:04:37.770 --> 00:04:45.360
Like here's one you will see all the time on Instagram with a quote so logo then you put a background

71
00:04:45.390 --> 00:04:49.200
image and you saturate it and make it black and white and then you put this.

72
00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:52.250
And then again put your tag over here.

73
00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.820
That's an incredibly common one.

74
00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.330
If you wanted to just edit this you could just change it to your colors.

75
00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:05.000
So if you wanted to edit it let's say we were going to do this for innovation inspiration or we could

76
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:12.070
do is just click these colored boxes over here and then up on the top left we can pick a color.

77
00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:12.930
OK.

78
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.680
Now it gives you a bunch of default ones that you can use and these are all kind of pastel So colors

79
00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:22.810
they'll look pretty good and they're all made for social media if you want to add your own.

80
00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:26.560
Use it plus and then pick on this color wheel.

81
00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:30.740
Generally the way that I copy colors is I use a hex code.

82
00:05:30.740 --> 00:05:33.850
If you guys use Photoshop it's a really easy way of doing it.

83
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:40.200
So I might change this one to one of our primary colors which was this kind of orange red.

84
00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.950
Those at the bottom of that graphic where it's taking off.

85
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:46.360
You can see it right here.

86
00:05:46.370 --> 00:05:47.600
This is kind of with the graphic.

87
00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:50.240
So down here is that Orange and it ends up in this balloon.

88
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:53.210
So really we can have that a purple and a blue.

89
00:05:53.210 --> 00:05:58.640
So we'll try to recreate that and then it really kind of comes down to like tweaking.

90
00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:01.320
So you can change this.

91
00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:01.800
It's

92
00:06:05.100 --> 00:06:12.840
Try to keep this the same color and go change this to maybe the purple or the blue that we have.

93
00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:23.950
So that might look a little bit better in this case and might maybe put a white background behind this

94
00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:31.060
or something along those lines and if we want to do that go over here to the elements tab and the elements

95
00:06:31.060 --> 00:06:34.300
tab gives us a whole section of things that we can play around with.

96
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:36.120
So they have free photos.

97
00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:38.880
They're all high resolution and they're all royalty free.

98
00:06:38.890 --> 00:06:44.830
You can insert these instead of some of the backgrounds they have that's super useful.

99
00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:49.630
They have tons and tons and tons of these just the easiest way to do it is just to search for something

100
00:06:49.630 --> 00:06:52.660
you want so I can say like rocket

101
00:06:56.530 --> 00:06:58.830
any rocket than photos.

102
00:06:58.900 --> 00:07:02.770
And here we go now we have a bunch of rocket type images.

103
00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.250
So could probably put this in.

104
00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:06.910
There we go.

105
00:07:06.910 --> 00:07:13.780
So I just kind of drop it and it will automatically resize it for me and copy the same dispatcher ization

106
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:14.550
that we saw.

107
00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:20.740
So that's really easy if you kind of notice down here that we're having issues with visibility.

108
00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:26.760
So what you would do is just again back to elements these are your photos but you can add shapes.

109
00:07:26.770 --> 00:07:32.590
So I would just go to shape and give you a bunch of shapes to choose from and then what would you pick.

110
00:07:32.590 --> 00:07:37.280
Probably a square in this case and I would probably Let's see.

111
00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:40.610
Can you make this white or one of our primary colors.

112
00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:48.940
Looks and then if I want to appear behind the tax go up here to a range and you sit back and just keep

113
00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:50.940
doing that until there you go.

114
00:07:51.260 --> 00:07:53.930
I more forward.

115
00:07:54.010 --> 00:07:54.450
OK.

116
00:07:54.550 --> 00:08:07.870
So you know you could do it like that and maybe we change that bottom tax to our purple.

117
00:08:07.880 --> 00:08:09.740
All right so that makes a little more sense.

118
00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.140
You just treat this a little bit.

119
00:08:11.360 --> 00:08:13.410
So it looks a little bit better.

120
00:08:13.440 --> 00:08:16.390
I wanted to I could use this button right here.

121
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:18.820
This looks like a transparency.

122
00:08:18.980 --> 00:08:21.660
Click that and I can make the opacity change.

123
00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:31.300
So depending on how much of an effect I needed to make that text pop out I could do a little bit make

124
00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:33.210
it a little opaque could I.

125
00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:36.450
So then you can kind of still see the outline a little bit.

126
00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:42.340
That's probably not super effective on Instagram post just because the images are going too small in

127
00:08:42.340 --> 00:08:43.450
your phone to notice that.

128
00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:45.220
So just throw it back up.

129
00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:48.520
All right it's going back to exploring the elements tab over here with other things.

130
00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:56.380
We have frames of what frames are essentially are our kind of like the collages we saw in the Instagram

131
00:08:56.380 --> 00:09:00.790
app when we did the walkthrough that basically the same way this works is I would throw one of these

132
00:09:00.790 --> 00:09:05.080
on and then you see this little Illustrated landscape.

133
00:09:05.080 --> 00:09:09.280
I'm then able to pick an image and throw it into that landscape.

134
00:09:09.340 --> 00:09:14.300
So if it's some weird thing like this I can pick four images to put in.

135
00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:18.180
It can be kind of useful sometimes if you want to put an image in say like a bubble.

136
00:09:18.220 --> 00:09:23.850
You might have seen these in my courses all actually just take a frame like this it just throw it in

137
00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:31.170
and then I can just toss an image inside of it and automatically resize so if I did that.

138
00:09:31.180 --> 00:09:31.680
There you go.

139
00:09:31.680 --> 00:09:34.980
Now you have a circular slack ok.

140
00:09:34.980 --> 00:09:36.510
Back to the elements tab.

141
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:39.100
The frames are worth playing around with.

142
00:09:39.180 --> 00:09:41.730
Sometimes you can make interesting effects.

143
00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:46.290
Sometimes they can help you like for instance you can throw in an iPhone if you want to make something

144
00:09:46.290 --> 00:09:50.390
that has an iPhone or Android and that can actually save you a lot of time.

145
00:09:50.400 --> 00:09:52.400
Grids are a little bit different.

146
00:09:52.440 --> 00:09:56.150
That's kind of the same thing but it automatically takes over the entire screen.

147
00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:04.170
So it's meant for the entire image and gerät frame is more about putting these images inside of something

148
00:10:04.170 --> 00:10:05.630
so it has an outline around it.

149
00:10:05.700 --> 00:10:13.530
But as things were looking at our illustrations windes icons charts and then they have some other categories

150
00:10:13.530 --> 00:10:16.450
of just a little more specific if you want to get into that.

151
00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:21.110
You know they have illustrations that can be sometimes useful if it fits your brand profile.

152
00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:24.010
Usually illustrations you can edit the colors.

153
00:10:24.030 --> 00:10:26.400
So what gives you the palette right here.

154
00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:32.070
So if I wanted to you know make this fit my aesthetic I could just change these colors the same way

155
00:10:32.070 --> 00:10:33.130
I did it before.

156
00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:50.230
So maybe I change the red into my red and you turn blue to purple and then the one turns blue.

157
00:10:50.310 --> 00:10:50.980
OK.

158
00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.740
You know that's the if that's what I wanted to do.

159
00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:55.970
Illustrations are useful lines also.

160
00:10:55.990 --> 00:11:01.960
You know if you want to put some way to make a custom frame or anything you want to throw on there lines

161
00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:05.260
can be pretty helpful because they have arrows in them so a lot of times you make an image you want

162
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:06.400
to point to it.

163
00:11:06.550 --> 00:11:10.870
That's a pretty common social media technique and it works pretty well except gravitates people's attention

164
00:11:10.870 --> 00:11:15.730
towards that one thing they see are the one thing the arrows point to that can be pretty useful.

165
00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.030
The other ones are pretty self-explanatory.

166
00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:22.590
I mean they just kind of divided them up like here it's going to be images and illustrations.

167
00:11:22.870 --> 00:11:26.780
And here it's going to be people just stock photos of people that's great.

168
00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:31.360
Now if you want to tax this over here you get taxed and it's fairly simple.

169
00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:36.320
You can add a heading and subheading and then these are some preset things that you can do so don't

170
00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.860
put a big piece of text and be like right there.

171
00:11:38.860 --> 00:11:43.010
And the reason why this comes out and Proxima Nova is because I'm using a pro account in the pro count

172
00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:47.980
allows me to set the default font to proxy even though which is that I use it only of course as you've

173
00:11:47.980 --> 00:11:55.390
probably seen it text is also pretty helpful because they'll give you examples of text compositions

174
00:11:55.390 --> 00:11:58.690
that you can throw in and they're like ready to go pretty much.

175
00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:02.830
I could blow this up to cover the entire screen if I wanted to.

176
00:12:02.830 --> 00:12:08.980
So if I wanted to make my own little thing I could just delete everything on here drag delete.

177
00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.350
Then I could go here grab some images.

178
00:12:13.390 --> 00:12:22.360
We'd say a rocket again like that on the than we can use I can resize it over here.

179
00:12:24.780 --> 00:12:25.270
OK.

180
00:12:25.300 --> 00:12:26.400
There we go.

181
00:12:26.410 --> 00:12:35.430
And then you go to taxed and throw in something like this and see how it fits and I can expand it turn

182
00:12:35.430 --> 00:12:42.890
it into let's say a white color match that barefoot and or I can just throw in a shape to cover it up

183
00:12:42.890 --> 00:12:44.150
like you just saw me do

184
00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:51.400
it.

185
00:12:51.410 --> 00:12:51.710
OK.

186
00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:56.690
I mean that's kind of how you have the making of an Instagram post.

187
00:12:56.690 --> 00:13:03.620
There were things worth covering I think or you'll notice when you click on elements on the canvas you

188
00:13:03.620 --> 00:13:06.500
can change things up here so things will be different.

189
00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:14.240
You can grow and resize it you can change the orientation like that all the talents you can group things

190
00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:14.790
together.

191
00:13:14.870 --> 00:13:19.430
That's pretty helpful say if you like making like bullet points that way that when you move one bullet

192
00:13:19.430 --> 00:13:20.910
point you can move all over them.

193
00:13:20.930 --> 00:13:25.400
And if you want to ungroup them you basically just click one of the things in the group and ungroup

194
00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:27.340
you probably won't use this button.

195
00:13:27.410 --> 00:13:32.900
This link button because you can't use links and Instagram images anyway so I'd probably just ignore

196
00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:33.360
that.

197
00:13:33.370 --> 00:13:35.010
Blessings worth looking at over here.

198
00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:40.440
You have the background tab and the background tab just gives you a lot of you can guess it backgrounds.

199
00:13:40.610 --> 00:13:43.000
Really these are going to be more patterns than anything.

200
00:13:43.070 --> 00:13:46.460
So we might have something like this.

201
00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.380
And you know this stuff works.

202
00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:51.290
You'll see there's quite a bit on people's Instagram pages.

203
00:13:51.410 --> 00:13:56.090
So use some funky background because it's just focusing on the image or focusing on the tax that's in

204
00:13:56.090 --> 00:13:57.320
front of it.

205
00:13:57.470 --> 00:14:02.930
Whatever you do just make sure that it fits that brand profile or the content strategy that you outline

206
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:09.950
before then you have uploads and upload is also pretty self-explanatory what you do and uploads is you

207
00:14:09.950 --> 00:14:11.160
upload things that's it.

208
00:14:11.180 --> 00:14:15.950
I mean the way you do it is you can upload something by clicking here or you can just drag and drop

209
00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:20.180
from one end and then all of a sudden you have images that you can use that you can see some of these

210
00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:21.920
images you've seen in my courses.

211
00:14:21.920 --> 00:14:26.540
Now when you're done with your image what you can do is just go up here to download or you can share

212
00:14:26.540 --> 00:14:30.040
directly to your social account if you want to.

213
00:14:30.050 --> 00:14:32.530
It's not generally something that I suggest.

214
00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.130
I usually just download it.

215
00:14:34.130 --> 00:14:36.800
Then I can do something else if I want to.

216
00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.540
So you want to make some public just go up here quick public and then all of a sudden when you get people

217
00:14:41.540 --> 00:14:44.110
share links they can actually see it.

218
00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:48.880
So what you can do is come here to link grab the link right there just copy it.

219
00:14:49.130 --> 00:14:53.270
And then if you send it to someone they can view it themselves and it shouldn't force them to create

220
00:14:53.270 --> 00:14:57.320
an account but it will ask them to if they want to edit it in some way cool.

221
00:14:57.350 --> 00:14:57.700
That's it.

222
00:14:57.710 --> 00:15:02.450
The only thing I think worth checking out is what's called the magic resize button and that's over here

223
00:15:02.750 --> 00:15:04.450
you go to magic resize.

224
00:15:04.460 --> 00:15:09.410
So what I'm saying before is if you made something and you're using the wrong size or maybe you're using

225
00:15:09.410 --> 00:15:13.790
a square and you decide hey I want to do the landscape which is 80 by 10.

226
00:15:13.820 --> 00:15:16.400
And then you said you want you 19:20 by 2080.

227
00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.740
Well you can do is change the dimensions manually here and then just type it in and change it or you

228
00:15:21.750 --> 00:15:27.860
use magic resize on my favorites what it will do is it will copy this and resize it automatically for

229
00:15:27.860 --> 00:15:31.850
you and you can do it for multiple things at a time.

230
00:15:31.850 --> 00:15:36.770
So it is really only useful if you did something in the wrong format and then want to ship it to Instagram

231
00:15:37.040 --> 00:15:41.240
but you can kind of see the same effect if say I want it to send to do a Facebook addresses is very

232
00:15:41.240 --> 00:15:42.630
similar.

233
00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:46.150
So there you go it's automatically resized to deal with any of that.

234
00:15:46.300 --> 00:15:47.770
Oh you guys canvas super cool.

235
00:15:47.780 --> 00:15:48.320
Check it out.

236
00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.390
It's FREE.

237
00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:56.600
I think it's a powerhouse for making image posts especially if you have a use for like illustrations

238
00:15:56.600 --> 00:16:02.120
and a lot of free photos and backgrounds and elements and things like that.

239
00:16:02.150 --> 00:16:08.390
Next lecture you're going to watch me make an actual photo for our Instagram account and I can kind

240
00:16:08.390 --> 00:16:10.070
of show you the finishing touches.

241
00:16:10.100 --> 00:16:12.680
I'll put you can skip that if you want to.

242
00:16:12.980 --> 00:16:13.760
Totally up to you.

243
00:16:13.760 --> 00:16:14.600
I don't care.

244
00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:14.840
All right.

245
00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:15.530
See you next lecture.
