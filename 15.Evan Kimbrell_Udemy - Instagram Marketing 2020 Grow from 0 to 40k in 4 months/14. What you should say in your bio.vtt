00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:01.820
All right, we are back.
1

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:05.370
Last Lecture, we covered the styles
that you can make your bio,
2

3
00:00:05.380 --> 00:00:10.030
in, and we discussed the right level of the emoji use-ness.
3

4
00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:10.900
Great.
4

5
00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:14.370
Now let's talk about the actual content of it.
5

6
00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:17.550
You only get 150 characters in your bio,
6

7
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.120
so what should you say?
7

8
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:27.360
150 characters really is more like 2-3 short sentences
or one normal sentence plus a short one.
8

9
00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:31.790
You don't have a whole lot of wiggle
room here, which is good and bad.
9

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:36.880
Don't have a lot of space for things to say, but also
it's not like you have infinite possibilities, so
10

11
00:00:36.880 --> 00:00:40.070
you shouldn't have analysis paralysis.
Either way, I want to make it simple for you.
11

12
00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:43.100
In your bio text, you need to answer two questions.
12

13
00:00:43.110 --> 00:00:44.700
Number one, what is this? What is this account?
Number two, why you should follow me?
13

14
00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:48.600
Number one, what is this? What is this account?
Number two, why you should follow me?
14

15
00:00:48.660 --> 00:00:49.240
OK.
15

16
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:51.860
That's what we want to know when we go to a profile.
16

17
00:00:51.870 --> 00:00:54.780
Now, imagine you see a funny comment or a funny post,
17

18
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.540
you click the profile icon, you go to their page.
18

19
00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:59.520
You want to know, who is this?
19

20
00:00:59.580 --> 00:01:02.060
Do they post more of the same?
20

21
00:01:02.070 --> 00:01:04.540
Would I want their stuff popping up in my feed?
21

22
00:01:04.680 --> 00:01:08.160
Basically, should I marry this and spend my life with it?
22

23
00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.980
Luckily, Instagram users don't believe in monogamy,
23

24
00:01:10.980 --> 00:01:13.440
so the bar here is actually pretty low.
24

25
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:17.010
Most users have between 100 and 300 accounts that they follow,
25

26
00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:19.340
so they're pretty loose with their love.
26

27
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.110
It's kind of like the show The Bachelor, except instead
of choosing one, they just got rid of the one
27

28
00:01:25.110 --> 00:01:29.070
that was really annoying and then they
marry all the others. Kind of like a cult.
28

29
00:01:29.070 --> 00:01:33.120
Anyway, the point is that you need to justify why you
should fit in that not at all selective group of 100-300.
29

30
00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:36.540
Anyway, the point is that you need to justify why you
should fit in that not at all selective group of 100-300.
30

31
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:40.660
Now, if you did a good job with your account name,
and you weren't just lame and copied your username
31

32
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.330
into your account name, then
you should have a head start.
32

33
00:01:44.340 --> 00:01:46.450
That should explain who you are.
33

34
00:01:46.470 --> 00:01:50.790
That means you actually can just
use all the bio to explain the why.
34

35
00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.790
Why are you worthy of being followed?
35

36
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:58.140
If you're stuck, try to think of things like, what
are your credentials? Why are you different?
36

37
00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.060
What's your general outlook on anything?
37

38
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:01.570
How often do you post?
38

39
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:08.100
That's actually a really good one, because it always
is really nice to let people know that you are active,
39

40
00:02:08.190 --> 00:02:13.530
so that they don't actually have to go and look at your
photos and do detective work by looking at time
40

41
00:02:13.530 --> 00:02:14.580
stamps to see if you're active.
41

42
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:16.500
People don't like following inactive accounts.
42

43
00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.070
The bio is just copywriting 101.
43

44
00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:22.590
Don't sell your service or product, sell your account.
44

45
00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:27.250
Tell them the benefits of signing up instead
of just telling them flatly what you do.
45

46
00:02:27.330 --> 00:02:29.550
So why should they follow you?
46

47
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:33.620
Let's try writing a couple of these, and
let's do it for some made up accounts.
47

48
00:02:33.810 --> 00:02:39.660
Let's say that you make a cryptocurrency portfolio system
where the users can view how much money they blew
48

49
00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:43.440
on things like Dogecoin or whatever
Bitcoin is the real Bitcoin.
49

50
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:46.900
I actually can't remember, it's either
Bitcoin Classic or like Bitcoin 2.
50

51
00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.390
So in your account name you might put,
let's say, Smart Bitcoin Management.
51

52
00:02:52.410 --> 00:02:52.920
OK.
52

53
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.330
And then in the bio, let's say you put two lines, and one is
"The number one Bitcoin app on Apple Store 2018"
53

54
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:03.920
and then "Follow us for everyday
Bitcoin trends and insights."
54

55
00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:04.860
There you go.
55

56
00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.700
The name tells them what you are and
it could easily be the subtitle to your app.
56

57
00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:13.930
Then we gave our credentials and
answered the "why should you care" bit.
57

58
00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:20.190
Then we told them why follow us specifically.
If they want Bitcoin analysis, Bitcoin analysis
58

59
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:25.860
they shall get. A lot of times it's not immediately obvious
why they should follow an Instagram account.
59

60
00:03:26.110 --> 00:03:29.850
If I'm a massage parlor and I make
an Instagram account, that's cool, but
60

61
00:03:29.850 --> 00:03:32.760
why would I follow your Instagram account?
61

62
00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:36.450
You need to tell them. "You get discounts",
or "we show you techniques", or whatever.
62

63
00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:37.160
Let's do another one.
63

64
00:03:37.170 --> 00:03:44.430
Let's say you're a pop up shop selling avocado toast, which inexplicably is a thing and it costs about $8 in San Francisco.
64

65
00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.110
Let's say you're a pop up shop selling avocado toast, which inexplicably is a thing and it costs about $8 in San Francisco.
65

66
00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:53.050
So, for our name, let's just go with something like
"Best Avocado Toast in Town." For your bio,
66

67
00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:58.110
then we just have to answer what are the benefits of this theoretical shop and what else do users need to know about us.
67

68
00:03:58.110 --> 00:03:59.430
then we just have to answer what are the benefits of this theoretical shop and what else do users need to know about us.
68

69
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.820
So how about like, "Artisanally designed and mouthwatering"?
69

70
00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:09.690
"Now at the Pier building in SF", San Francisco.
Then you could put "Follow for new locations."
70

71
00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:12.270
Yes, I know, blah, but you get the point.
71

72
00:04:12.270 --> 00:04:16.080
We hit them with the "we're the best in the [...],"
72

73
00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:17.970
then we gave a little differentiation.
73

74
00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:18.210
then we gave a little differentiation.
74

75
00:04:18.210 --> 00:04:19.240
"We're artisanal."
75

76
00:04:19.290 --> 00:04:24.240
I'm not really sure how exactly that applies
to toast, but maybe that will pique interest.
76

77
00:04:24.270 --> 00:04:29.580
Then we gave some crucial info, where we are and why
you should follow us. A lot of businesses never really
77

78
00:04:29.580 --> 00:04:32.350
justify why you should follow them,
and as a result, people don't.
78

79
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.720
It's not immediately obvious why a pop up
shop needs an Instagram account.
79

80
00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.470
OK guys, that's it for now.
80

81
00:04:37.470 --> 00:04:40.790
Hopefully these examples helped you. In the
resources, we have more examples, if you're stuck.
81

82
00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:42.130
Hopefully these examples helped you. In the
resources, we have more examples, if you're stuck.
82

83
00:04:42.150 --> 00:04:45.030
Other than that, it's pretty simple.
83

84
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.490
Justify why they should follow you,
84

85
00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:50.190
give them a real reason, give some differentiation,
85

86
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:56.490
show your credentials, or if you're, you know, stuck
where they don't actually know what your account is yet,
86

87
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.570
explain what you are.
87

88
00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:57.970
Alright guys.
88

89
00:04:57.970 --> 00:04:59.620
With that being said, moving on.
