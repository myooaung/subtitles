1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,540
OK we are back.

2
00:00:01,550 --> 00:00:05,420
So last lecture I just showed you what the SCRAM live looks like.

3
00:00:05,550 --> 00:00:07,240
Well I mean it works.

4
00:00:07,260 --> 00:00:13,350
I think it got 200 people to view it in total and then add a lot of people tagging.

5
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:17,630
You noticed kind of towards the end some people were getting a little out of hand so you might need

6
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,670
to think in the future about how to restructure something like this maybe such in a way people towards

7
00:00:23,670 --> 00:00:25,570
the end don't feel like there's no way to win.

8
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,050
They just start kind of scurrying around but of the most part that went relatively smoothly.

9
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,920
One other thing you might have missed was I just was playing a youtube playlist in the background because

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:36,420
any live is going to have audio.

11
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:38,990
So I just kind of threw that on his Labi music.

12
00:00:38,990 --> 00:00:45,030
Now what I need to do though very quickly is tell people hey we're relaunching the video to figure out

13
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:45,660
who won.

14
00:00:45,660 --> 00:00:50,280
Right so I don't think I just ran away with whatever their time i guess.

15
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:57,260
So what I'm going to do is post the story really fast so we'll go over here so we'll go to type so tap

16
00:00:57,290 --> 00:01:00,080
to type you

17
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:10,960
put this ad in The Kids way.

18
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:16,600
And then I will do I'll post this and then I'll just post another one.

19
00:01:16,630 --> 00:01:18,340
All fast.

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:18,960
Save it.

21
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:23,490
I'll send it to a story share it.

22
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:24,990
Really fast.

23
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:33,000
All right now the next thing I'll do is give everyone say or

24
00:01:40,470 --> 00:01:43,320
change the color something all that different.

25
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:43,810
Great.

26
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:44,850
OK.

27
00:01:44,850 --> 00:01:51,340
So I'll send this to my story OK.

28
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:53,960
Now that should be done.

29
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:57,160
He loves it.

30
00:01:57,380 --> 00:01:57,970
Great.

31
00:01:58,190 --> 00:02:01,520
OK so now people know that this Brack's doing something.

32
00:02:01,700 --> 00:02:03,720
I'll try to make a regular post.

33
00:02:03,830 --> 00:02:05,120
Really quickly.

34
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:07,220
So do it like we're doing before.

35
00:02:08,810 --> 00:02:12,370
I'll take out the image.

36
00:02:12,710 --> 00:02:14,540
Take them on I go.

37
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:16,110
I'll put this up and I'll put

38
00:02:25,820 --> 00:02:26,550
up.

39
00:02:26,740 --> 00:02:28,870
Beautiful but gets the point across.

40
00:02:28,870 --> 00:02:33,240
Now what I'll do is I'll share this as a story and then I'll put this as a post really quickly.

41
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:38,870
So throw on innovation station just doesn't mention

42
00:02:45,690 --> 00:02:46,060
OK.

43
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:49,640
So now I'll save this to my story.

44
00:02:49,660 --> 00:02:51,520
Great.

45
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,790
And we'll post a regular post.

46
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:59,230
So this one or it says give us a sec Well the winner shortly.

47
00:02:59,230 --> 00:03:03,840
So I'll just post that and I'm not going to post this with any like hashtags or anything.

48
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,600
It's not really worth it.

49
00:03:05,600 --> 00:03:08,440
I'll put the location just in case.

50
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:09,140
So

51
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:17,680
we watch video to see on

52
00:03:21,580 --> 00:03:30,540
you know try something or I think the question I had was way too easy someone got it within like five

53
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:30,940
seconds.

54
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:32,270
I think it's just because they Googled it.

55
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,480
I need to put a little more thought into something that you can't Google it you know like you could

56
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:36,990
answer it.

57
00:03:36,990 --> 00:03:39,750
Not everyone will immediately know that's the answer.

58
00:03:39,810 --> 00:03:42,730
I think that's one issue that kind of ran into it.

59
00:03:42,740 --> 00:03:45,520
So as someone said keyboard than everybody said keyboard.

60
00:03:45,550 --> 00:03:48,200
So.

61
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,540
We go.

62
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:52,980
And then I'll say like really quickly.

63
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:57,840
See you next door to the next.

64
00:03:57,910 --> 00:04:01,420
Give me whether or not I actually do this next Saturday.

65
00:04:01,540 --> 00:04:03,010
I don't really know.

66
00:04:03,020 --> 00:04:05,060
I'll have to look and see how it actually worked.

67
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:07,310
See if we got any followers for a minute.

68
00:04:07,340 --> 00:04:11,030
I also noticed there's a lot of people who are attacking people but they weren't tagging their friends

69
00:04:11,030 --> 00:04:15,280
they were tagging like me are huge accounts like Amazon.

70
00:04:15,290 --> 00:04:17,950
I need to probably specify that a little bit more.

71
00:04:17,960 --> 00:04:21,670
It's just a problem that you don't want to make is too complicated.

72
00:04:21,970 --> 00:04:22,270
OK.

73
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:23,580
So OK.

74
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:24,950
And Share.

75
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:25,680
OK.

76
00:04:25,700 --> 00:04:28,890
So that pretty much sums it up for the live section.

77
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:30,440
You saw how that went.

78
00:04:30,440 --> 00:04:31,780
I'm going to go figure out who won this.

79
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,210
But since we're in the live section or are we going to get into that when we get into giveaways later

80
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:40,640
we'll talk about what auctions you have for giveaways story giveaways post giveaways live giveaways

81
00:04:41,030 --> 00:04:45,680
we'll try some of those out to see what works there's also different mechanics that you can use for

82
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:47,480
giveaways that make the model more effective.

83
00:04:47,480 --> 00:04:54,650
There's a lot of things we tried tag all your friends and also telling the answer turns out the riddle

84
00:04:54,650 --> 00:05:00,230
I used was too easy and I didn't really specify who to tag but I did get a lot of people tagging people

85
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,110
except towards the end.

86
00:05:02,110 --> 00:05:06,590
Also one thing that's worth noting now is I know there are some bad actors some people that are posting

87
00:05:06,650 --> 00:05:12,210
really bizarre things and so I can block them or hide that story from them.

88
00:05:12,220 --> 00:05:18,230
So you guys remember when you do live you can go to the settings and it says like hide story from when

89
00:05:18,270 --> 00:05:20,840
it's a story it means live so I can do that.

90
00:05:21,020 --> 00:05:26,010
Ok cool thing I'll do is delete the old give away post and then.

91
00:05:26,060 --> 00:05:26,970
Yeah that's it.

92
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:27,410
OK.

93
00:05:27,530 --> 00:05:28,760
So you guys saw that worked out.

94
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:34,510
That was one way of doing a live strategy that works in tandem with giveaways certainly role for themed

95
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:34,910
accounts.

96
00:05:34,910 --> 00:05:38,750
If I was doing a personal account that I would have just done like a Q&amp;A and I would have set up a bunch

97
00:05:38,750 --> 00:05:44,170
of stories over the week to gather a bunch of questions and then I would have done it if I were a business.

98
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:48,960
I don't know I could've done behind the scenes that could I did it in a tutorial something educational

99
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:50,590
an announcement or something like that.

100
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,810
But with D-Md. accounts I think you're kind of limited.

101
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:55,900
It's really up to how creative you can be.

102
00:05:55,920 --> 00:06:00,050
One thing I think it's really useful those to make sure that you are following a lot of similar accounts

103
00:06:00,050 --> 00:06:05,310
in your space to see what they do and see what they use Instagram live for because it might be the case

104
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:08,680
if someone else figures out something and that's something you might want to emulate.

105
00:06:08,770 --> 00:06:09,130
OK.

106
00:06:09,170 --> 00:06:10,810
That being said the next lecture.
