1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,710
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:05,660
So this lecture we're going to go over a giveaway that we did on Saturday for innovation station.

3
00:00:05,670 --> 00:00:07,990
Now have you guys watched the Instagram live section.

4
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:09,090
It's a little bit redundant.

5
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:14,850
It kind of went over how to make this work for Instagram live give away but we didn't have to do it

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:18,840
necessarily as an Instagram live give away we were just trying to do that because we thought that was

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:21,140
a little more interesting at the moment.

8
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,620
Instagram lives get a lot of attention because they pop up on everybody's screen and it's like a push

9
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:27,500
notification to get their attention.

10
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:28,640
That's kind of why I went that way.

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:32,620
But you could do it as a story or you can even just do it as a regular post.

12
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:38,280
OK so this was the general route we were going technology account so I wanted to give something away.

13
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:42,670
I also wanted to make sure that whatever I gave away was under $50 I also wanted to make sure that whatever

14
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,590
gave away it wasn't something that's actually interesting.

15
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:45,060
Right.

16
00:00:45,240 --> 00:00:50,950
So I picked Amazon echo Daut which are the tiny Amazon Alexa devices.

17
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,860
And then the instax 6 x 6 is a kind of handheld like New-Age Polaroid.

18
00:00:57,180 --> 00:01:00,660
So you take a photo and it prints out a Polaroid image right on the spot.

19
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:01,590
They're very popular.

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:01,880
OK.

21
00:01:01,890 --> 00:01:07,710
So what I did was about two days before I posted a story exactly like you're seeing right now or I put

22
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:10,570
an image of both of them and I said Which one do you prefer.

23
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:14,250
Now I use this as just a way to announce that hey we're going to give a give away and I want to make

24
00:01:14,250 --> 00:01:18,470
sure that everyone has a say and that whatever I give away is going to be popular.

25
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,670
I don't want to give away the camera.

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,290
No one wants it because even if they're there when I start to give away they're not going to participate.

27
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:28,950
So I just set this up and it had a little though down at the bottom that was pretty simple and I set

28
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,530
a defined day and time when it was going to happen.

29
00:01:32,530 --> 00:01:35,250
So I said Saturday September 8 3pm p.m. Yes.

30
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:36,740
Make sure you get the time zone.

31
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,410
So that's what it looked like when it was running as an actual story.

32
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:45,410
OK after a day 24 hours of voting it looked like 58 percent said Ecko.

33
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:52,410
I think I had about 100 people participate and say that they preferred that once not a strong preference

34
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,620
but again they spoke with their words therefore I use that as a way to get more attention and then what

35
00:01:58,620 --> 00:02:01,300
I did was I reposted the results.

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:06,120
That's pretty easy to do because all you have to do is when you post a story go over to insites in your

37
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:14,880
account and then go to content and then you can go down to your stories it see all and then find the

38
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:16,170
one where they voted on it.

39
00:02:16,170 --> 00:02:19,820
So this is pretty easy to just give away and then scroll up OK.

40
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:21,510
And then only share results.

41
00:02:21,510 --> 00:02:22,170
So that was easy.

42
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:24,570
So I got to hit them twice with the same thing.

43
00:02:24,570 --> 00:02:27,450
So on day one I said Which one do you prefer.

44
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,310
They told me the next day I said here are the results so it reminds them again this is coming up now

45
00:02:32,310 --> 00:02:33,430
in two days.

46
00:02:33,480 --> 00:02:40,080
Then what I did is I ran a story the next day promoting that it was indeed going to happen.

47
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:47,130
So then I posted another story and a Post the day of just to give people a heads up like hey it's coming

48
00:02:47,130 --> 00:02:47,730
right now.

49
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,230
What I said is I said give away a lie and 45 minutes that I had a hash tag just so it gets more visibility

50
00:02:52,370 --> 00:02:53,370
than I tagged myself.

51
00:02:53,370 --> 00:02:57,840
Just so if they're reading the story then click that to go to my account and then I put the date on

52
00:02:57,840 --> 00:02:58,580
I'm giving away.

53
00:02:58,590 --> 00:03:03,990
And then I said live in 45 minutes and I did that just as a reminder because oftentimes people use Instagram

54
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,990
will use it for 20 30 minutes at a time.

55
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,110
So if they're using it right now and it's going to happen in 45 minutes that might be enough for them

56
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,040
to hang on and stay for 45 minutes at least know to check their phone in 45 minutes.

57
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:15,370
That was the strategy I went with.

58
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:19,710
I did this is a story and as a post when I got to the actual give away this is what I did I actually

59
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,600
just filmed my iPad screen.

60
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,470
As you can see and I put give away starts in five minutes it will give instructions to complete the

61
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:27,390
first version do so wins.

62
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,820
And the reason why I did this was because it was in scrammed live you can't use static images on screen

63
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:32,130
live.

64
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:35,360
You got to actually just put it next to a screen if you want to do that.

65
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:37,190
That's not generally on the screen lives for.

66
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,930
But you know in the future it might be the case that they have some way of doing this.

67
00:03:40,940 --> 00:03:46,420
Now I did this saying give away starts in five minutes because I wanted people to pile into the live.

68
00:03:46,530 --> 00:03:50,970
So when you're doing a live you can see the live counter of how many people are watching.

69
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:56,610
So you don't immediately just go in and start the competition or the giveaway because someone might

70
00:03:56,610 --> 00:04:01,320
figure it out very quickly and anybody else who joins it maybe five minutes later isn't going to want

71
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,070
to participate.

72
00:04:02,070 --> 00:04:07,140
So I said give away starts five minutes in everyone kind of pooled together started commenting started

73
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:07,670
liking.

74
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:13,740
And that allowed me to essentially start ranking higher on the tech giveaways hash tag page.

75
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:20,370
Ok then what I did was I literally just flipped the page to the next set of instructions and that's

76
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:24,130
how I ran the competition like so.

77
00:04:24,920 --> 00:04:26,700
And I set the competition rules like this.

78
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:27,600
That was the prize.

79
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:28,960
I said the rules.

80
00:04:29,230 --> 00:04:33,900
What Adam do is two things to answer a riddle in the comments and the riddle unfortunately was just

81
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:35,640
it was something you could have googled.

82
00:04:35,640 --> 00:04:39,690
That was kind of all of the problems I need to think of a riddle that has an answer that you can't find

83
00:04:39,730 --> 00:04:44,280
online because that's pretty much the easiest thing in the world learning how to think about it.

84
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:49,490
So ideally I would have designed that one better than it's as tag as many friends count as you can.

85
00:04:49,530 --> 00:04:51,450
Now I didn't specify what different account was.

86
00:04:51,450 --> 00:04:52,320
That was a mistake.

87
00:04:52,350 --> 00:04:57,270
I should have specified this is someone you know or someone who follows you or something like that then

88
00:04:57,260 --> 00:04:58,980
I just said we're going to run this for 15 minutes.

89
00:04:58,980 --> 00:05:03,080
Whoever gets the correct anti-X most people wins Amazon Ecko I didn't do it just because I didn't do

90
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:03,170
it.

91
00:05:03,170 --> 00:05:07,660
Just saying get this answer correct and you win because then it would have been over in a minute.

92
00:05:07,690 --> 00:05:11,370
Let's ask you the hard question which you don't know until you actually watch it.

93
00:05:11,450 --> 00:05:14,350
Then the second thing was that you had to tag as many people as possible.

94
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:17,820
So let's say in the first five minutes everybody gets the answer right.

95
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:21,920
Then you have 10 minutes to see how dedicated you are to attack as many people to bring them into the

96
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:24,700
chat rooms bring their attention to your account.

97
00:05:24,710 --> 00:05:26,120
That was the idea at least.

98
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:32,340
OK now we can look at the stats from when we did the promotion to see how that worked out.

99
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:37,220
So if you go to a Konno Square we can kind of look at the followers graph.

100
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:43,190
So you go to analytics community so follower growth and then oh this.

101
00:05:43,220 --> 00:05:44,920
So it was on the 8.

102
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:45,410
OK.

103
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,780
So you know this right here we gained 189 followers that day.

104
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:53,990
Now in order to decide whether or not this was worth it it's really hard to tell because there is a

105
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:55,790
lot of moving parts.

106
00:05:55,820 --> 00:05:59,760
We had just downshifted our posting strategy to using new content.

107
00:05:59,780 --> 00:06:02,110
We didn't know if it was going to do really well.

108
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:09,500
And then immediately after we switched back to top 10 percent of engagement quality posts and then all

109
00:06:09,500 --> 00:06:13,370
of a sudden you know it's more and more people are falling so really hard to say how many of these hundred

110
00:06:13,370 --> 00:06:15,420
89 would have came normally.

111
00:06:15,530 --> 00:06:19,730
The best thing you can do is kind of just get a weekly average or a daily average over the last month

112
00:06:20,060 --> 00:06:25,650
and then use that as a baseline and see whether or not you went above that I would say that probably

113
00:06:25,710 --> 00:06:32,480
we gained last maybe a hundred followers maybe yeah maybe $75 is probably a good guess.

114
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:34,670
Now $75 worth $50.

115
00:06:34,670 --> 00:06:36,910
No not in the slightest.

116
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:42,290
But like I said before this is something that you do repeatedly and at first it's not really something

117
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:44,390
that has a great R-N.Y.

118
00:06:44,420 --> 00:06:50,600
Typically the people that do really good giveaways do it every single week the same exact time so everybody

119
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:54,710
knows when to show up and they know that it's a set routine and eventually they get to a point where

120
00:06:54,980 --> 00:06:59,680
you can kind of automate these without having to sit there and you know manage the whole thing right

121
00:06:59,690 --> 00:07:05,780
you'll come up with a an ask from your followers and apprise such that you don't really have to do a

122
00:07:05,780 --> 00:07:06,760
lot of management.

123
00:07:06,770 --> 00:07:12,380
Like for instance I said that at the end of 15 minutes we'll say who wins based on the riddle and then

124
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:18,890
based off of how many people they tag because I didn't want to sit there for 15 minutes and watch people

125
00:07:18,890 --> 00:07:22,840
and tally it up I just did it so that later I could come back and check in and see.

126
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:26,040
And in our live we got something like 200 people in it.

127
00:07:26,090 --> 00:07:29,470
So the next time I ran it would be kind of the number to beat right.

128
00:07:29,510 --> 00:07:31,600
My guess is probably got $75.

129
00:07:31,730 --> 00:07:33,320
So we obviously optimize that.

130
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:37,960
The second thing is how many live count like people in the actual live.

131
00:07:37,970 --> 00:07:38,540
Could we get.

132
00:07:38,540 --> 00:07:41,510
And that would be another way of measuring whether or not we're improving.

133
00:07:41,510 --> 00:07:46,460
What I did immediately after it ended because I didn't want people to freak out about not knowing where

134
00:07:47,540 --> 00:07:50,490
the competition was or who won.

135
00:07:50,510 --> 00:07:53,420
I did a quick story that said Thank you everyone who didn't give away.

136
00:07:53,430 --> 00:07:55,750
And I just did that by going to the text.

137
00:07:55,760 --> 00:08:01,340
If you go to your camera and there's different types of cameras you can use the far left is text so

138
00:08:01,340 --> 00:08:05,290
you can just type this out really quickly and it's great for dashing out a message.

139
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:09,700
Then the next one said we are watching the video to see who won and it is incredibly tedious.

140
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,930
I'll be honest so you can do this repeatedly.

141
00:08:11,930 --> 00:08:15,020
Figure out a strategy for how to figure out who the winner is.

142
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:16,310
Otherwise you'll drown.

143
00:08:16,370 --> 00:08:20,600
Did what I did as I posted a regular post in case they didn't see the story and said Give us a sec we'll

144
00:08:20,600 --> 00:08:21,740
announce the winner shortly.

145
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:27,180
Made this in quite literally 10 seconds using the tools that we covered in the story section.

146
00:08:27,200 --> 00:08:30,350
Then when it is I found the winner it was the winner.

147
00:08:30,350 --> 00:08:32,000
This guy only has one follower.

148
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,190
This is what happens often times you giveaways not competitions.

149
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:39,080
You get a lot of kind of low quality participants but it's fine.

150
00:08:39,170 --> 00:08:45,970
And then what it is I just took a screen cap of his account and I just wrote winner and then said Will

151
00:08:45,970 --> 00:08:51,070
D.M. you and I tagged him so that he would get notified of the you automatically get a direct message.

152
00:08:51,080 --> 00:08:56,120
Then what I did is I made a post where I post that as well and I tagged two of the people who were the

153
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:56,980
follow ups.

154
00:08:57,010 --> 00:09:01,790
The people who came closest to winning besides the winner just so I could get their attention so they

155
00:09:01,790 --> 00:09:04,640
wouldn't leave thinking that this was a complete scam.

156
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:06,570
This is kind of what the page winds up looking like.

157
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:11,570
And then I left those up for maybe 12 hours just so that everybody who potentially came in contact with

158
00:09:11,570 --> 00:09:16,190
it saw it and then I ended up deleting them and we went back to our typical post composition.

159
00:09:16,190 --> 00:09:18,200
All right guys that's pretty much the summary of the giveaway we did.

160
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,090
If you want to watch it in live action go to the Instagram live section.

161
00:09:22,100 --> 00:09:24,120
You can watch me do it there.

162
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:30,260
But really what we learned is that we've got about 200 people into the live for the give away and we

163
00:09:30,260 --> 00:09:36,650
spent about fifty six dollars on an Amazon echo and only got about 75 followers.

164
00:09:36,650 --> 00:09:41,510
So it's like one and a quarter followers per dollar spent which is not very good in general.

165
00:09:41,510 --> 00:09:45,670
Typically if you do a promotion inside the app you can get two to one three to one.

166
00:09:45,730 --> 00:09:50,930
You do a shout out even like a page shout out you get like five to one sometimes even you're really

167
00:09:50,930 --> 00:09:51,500
lucky.

168
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:52,340
Ten to one.

169
00:09:52,400 --> 00:09:56,480
So from our allies standpoint not great but the jury's still out because this is something that you

170
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:58,800
have to do as a consistent strategy so keep that in mind.

171
00:09:58,910 --> 00:09:59,930
All right guys see the next lecture.
