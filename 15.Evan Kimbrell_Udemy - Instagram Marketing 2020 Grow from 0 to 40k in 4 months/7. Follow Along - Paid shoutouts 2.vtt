00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:01.170
You guys will come back.

2
00:00:01.170 --> 00:00:01.440
OK.

3
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:03.760
So let's check in on a second page.

4
00:00:03.780 --> 00:00:04.530
Shout out.

5
00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:10.650
So before we talked about the first one I did with Khurrana attack so try out a second one and this

6
00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:12.190
one did not go as well.

7
00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:15.550
OK so I worked with tech interventions in vengeance.

8
00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:20.460
And they have 121 thousand followers I use shout card again for this one.

9
00:00:20.670 --> 00:00:27.840
And as you can see they posted our thing right there and then also bought their bio which I don't really

10
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:30.750
know how long that was still last but whatever.

11
00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.910
So what I did is I went to court and I paid $60 for a permanent post plus bio link.

12
00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:41.770
Now I wasn't sure if the bio link was permanent like whether or not I was going to get that permanent

13
00:00:41.800 --> 00:00:45.930
plane but it seems to be the case since they haven't taken it down.

14
00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.590
I don't know maybe eventually they'll get rid of it.

15
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.540
It seems a little ridiculous seeing pay $60 and not change their biologic for ever.

16
00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:54.460
But anyway we'll see.

17
00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:58.100
So as you can see they posted 35000 views.

18
00:00:58.110 --> 00:01:05.030
That's great whatever the number of interactions was about something like 2000.

19
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:05.900
So over here.

20
00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.620
OK so I did a hype auditor on them.

21
00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:14.370
You can see that a 68 to decent quality of followers.

22
00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:15.970
Their engagement rate is fine.

23
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:18.300
I think that's probably pretty average.

24
00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:23.880
So what we expected from them would have been the hundred twenty one thousand we would've expected probably

25
00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:29.500
about 7500 pieces of engagement known as incredibly low dollar per.

26
00:01:29.560 --> 00:01:35.490
That's also because I'm buying permanent posts and it's really hard to figure out how much you're going

27
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:39.590
to get from say like a permanent bio change.

28
00:01:39.690 --> 00:01:41.060
So it's hard to say.

29
00:01:41.100 --> 00:01:45.810
Again I'm just kind of experimenting to see what works then eventually you kind of hammer out a cost

30
00:01:45.810 --> 00:01:47.730
efficient strategy later on.

31
00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:52.110
We're also just trying to get to a point where we have enough followers to switch to the next type of

32
00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:57.010
shouting which was shout for shouts which are free and a much better way to grow.

33
00:01:57.030 --> 00:02:00.200
But we have to get to a point where councils even talk to us.

34
00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:05.430
So now if we run the numbers down here this is roughly what I got to go to Iconium square I did it on

35
00:02:05.430 --> 00:02:08.680
the first and use a jump here about 130.

36
00:02:08.730 --> 00:02:16.680
So what I've been working off of is that on any given day they post 5 times I usually expect something

37
00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.360
like 50 followers from just from hash tagging.

38
00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.990
That'll go up as the account gets larger and larger because we'll start ranking and the hashtags.

39
00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.150
But that's been the baseline I've been using.

40
00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:29.330
So when I come back to here actually need to adjust this.

41
00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:38.310
So really I should say 80 so that's not particularly good for going follower's engagement.

42
00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:44.610
Yeah I mean it was a little bit bigger than what we would have expected in getting something like 2000

43
00:02:44.610 --> 00:02:47.130
likes and like a comment.

44
00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:53.010
And yeah I mean that means that it's a good account to probably work with as in the audience likes your

45
00:02:53.010 --> 00:02:59.340
stuff but it didn't end up being a big change to your following.

46
00:02:59.340 --> 00:03:04.350
So that's something that's worth keeping in mind you can engage certain groups but if they don't follow

47
00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:06.490
you then it's sometimes not really worth it.

48
00:03:06.490 --> 00:03:08.580
Obviously it kind of depends what you're going for.

49
00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:13.030
One other benefit of doing that was that I kind of got on this person's radar which is nice.

50
00:03:13.080 --> 00:03:17.370
You'll notice they started reposting more of our stuff so I posted this one again.

51
00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.980
Kind of annoying that they don't give you attribution.

52
00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.870
Drives me crazy.

53
00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:24.460
But we all end up probably doing is making this larger.

54
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.590
You can't ignore the innovations station text and then message them like you need to change that.

55
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.460
OK let's see now.

56
00:03:32.490 --> 00:03:36.790
One other one worth looking at because I'm in the future is.

57
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:42.230
I tried using brilliant inventions and if I remember that one that was the one that was just huge.

58
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:46.310
That emigrates score and didn't have great engagement rates so I wanted to try.

59
00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.350
Just a big bulbous one that's just gigantic.

60
00:03:49.350 --> 00:03:51.560
And to see how that one goes.

61
00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:53.030
Now the problem with them.

62
00:03:53.040 --> 00:04:00.800
I ran into was I went through by self shout outs and they don't actually allow you to upload videos.

63
00:04:00.810 --> 00:04:06.060
OK and I messaged this account and said I'd like to do videos we do videos.

64
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:13.050
They never responded to what I had to end up doing actually and ended up working out fine was I took

65
00:04:13.050 --> 00:04:14.900
three different posts.

66
00:04:14.910 --> 00:04:24.120
We had video posts made screenshots of them and then overlaid the PNB file of that little video camera.

67
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.810
You see that makes it look like a camera.

68
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:29.100
So it end up looking like this.

69
00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:30.760
OK so that was the thumbnail.

70
00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:34.060
Now you see this up at the top and it makes it look like a video.

71
00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:34.450
Then what.

72
00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:41.630
All I did was put in the caption something really simple so I can get a brilliant inventions.

73
00:04:46.490 --> 00:04:47.780
And you can see it right here.

74
00:04:47.780 --> 00:04:49.870
So look it looks like a video right.

75
00:04:49.880 --> 00:04:53.180
Like it looks pretty much like all the other ones like that.

76
00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:53.800
OK.

77
00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.640
It's a little bit different but no one can really notice.

78
00:04:56.690 --> 00:05:00.710
So you click this and that was all I put I just said who wants you who doesn't want three arms.

79
00:05:00.710 --> 00:05:02.660
Good innovation to watch the video.

80
00:05:02.660 --> 00:05:03.100
Crazy.

81
00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:06.980
So you think it's a video and it just doesn't do anything.

82
00:05:06.980 --> 00:05:11.600
And so what end up happening actually was this drove a lot of followers.

83
00:05:11.660 --> 00:05:17.510
It's hard to say what exactly or how many exactly came from this but my guess is it's upwards of 500

84
00:05:17.510 --> 00:05:20.770
600 came just from that.

85
00:05:20.810 --> 00:05:25.510
So that's definitely something to keep in mind this account terrible engagement.

86
00:05:25.550 --> 00:05:26.810
But it's larger.

87
00:05:26.810 --> 00:05:32.800
And I used a technique almost by accident that drove more followers and less engagement.

88
00:05:32.810 --> 00:05:38.330
Like no one's really I mean a lot of people did end up commenting but why would do you want to see the

89
00:05:38.330 --> 00:05:42.800
video because this piqued your interest so you end up going to the account and what the probably the

90
00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:49.170
biggest benefit I noticed besides the 500 600 followers was that the people would go to my account and

91
00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:51.510
then they would like multiple things.

92
00:05:51.510 --> 00:05:57.890
They had a lot of people go and then like 10 15 things so people going all the way down the page and

93
00:05:57.890 --> 00:06:04.830
liking some of the really early stuff that we did I guess is only like a week ago or whatever but so

94
00:06:04.970 --> 00:06:06.830
that was pretty interesting.

95
00:06:06.830 --> 00:06:10.230
Keep that in mind on a dollar to dollar basis.

96
00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:11.630
I will have to run the numbers.

97
00:06:11.630 --> 00:06:16.370
I think this costs something like $90 and then message me and said that they're actually going to leave

98
00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:21.070
this and probably make it a permanent post so that's the case then and yeah it was probably worth it.

99
00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:23.650
But that's an example of using a big account.

100
00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.200
OK.

101
00:06:24.260 --> 00:06:26.270
They're not always a problem.

102
00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:28.020
They have low engagement but they're big.

103
00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:33.250
And also ones that are really tailored that seem to have really high engagement.

104
00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.200
That's also not a guaranteed win.

105
00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.420
So keep that in mind.

106
00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:37.200
OK guys.

107
00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:37.650
See you later.
