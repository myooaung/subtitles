1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,230
Hey guys welcome back to the course.

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:02,660
OK.

3
00:00:02,670 --> 00:00:07,410
So we are now going to dive in and look at paid shout outs.

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,440
Now Target others before paid shout out to you just pay for people to promote you.

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,000
This is often the case.

6
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:18,050
What you'll do when you want to have exposure on an account.

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:21,240
But they have way more followers than you.

8
00:00:21,250 --> 00:00:25,910
I mean oftentimes it'll happen as you do these tradeoffs where let's say they're twice as large as you.

9
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,180
So you do two shout outs for one but sometimes they're just so much larger.

10
00:00:30,180 --> 00:00:32,060
The only way you can do this is paying them.

11
00:00:32,370 --> 00:00:35,800
So let's explore that and wants to do that for innovation station.

12
00:00:35,810 --> 00:00:37,820
So OK this is what I did.

13
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:47,840
Now I went to three online places so we covered these earlier we had Buy Sell shout outs.

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,870
Another one is plug hype dot com and then shout cart dot com.

15
00:00:52,870 --> 00:00:56,360
And I think there's one other big one but these are kind of the major ones.

16
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,470
What I also did is I did direct messaging but look at that in a second.

17
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:09,330
So what I did a shout cart was I kind of just didn't have a technology section so I specifically just

18
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:14,850
checked it so that I wouldn't have things like meemies or things like food or lifestyle.

19
00:01:14,850 --> 00:01:17,190
And then I just searched for keyword Tech.

20
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,060
And so what it gave me were four accounts.

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:25,820
So we had this one grain attack extreme PC.

22
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,530
There was this one it showed up and then Tech next.

23
00:01:29,540 --> 00:01:34,570
OK so then what I did is I just kind of looked at each one.

24
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:38,060
OK so I found those ones I didn't exactly dive into it just yet.

25
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,970
Then I went over and found on by cell shout outs we had brilliant inventions we already had that one

26
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:50,640
up here and the other one I found them was philosophy of science.

27
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,190
So a little bit of a different angle.

28
00:01:52,210 --> 00:01:59,330
And the science appreciators as opposed to people who just like inventions now on plug hype.

29
00:01:59,460 --> 00:02:02,550
I found 24 hour success and odds about it.

30
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:04,640
Honestly like plug hype.

31
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:10,140
The only category they had was remotely relevant was entrepreneurship and everything down here was just

32
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:12,070
kind of I don't know.

33
00:02:12,210 --> 00:02:13,960
Somewhat relevant.

34
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:22,050
Usually these are just big Coke machines that just plug quotes onto backgrounds and then just post away.

35
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,030
Some of them are just you know they just reposed fancy things like this one.

36
00:02:26,310 --> 00:02:28,830
So I mean I'm sure I could get some followers from that.

37
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:32,280
It's just not exactly my knees.

38
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:38,310
So what I do on the phone was I just went inside to find one account that probably looks like a business

39
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:38,730
account.

40
00:02:38,770 --> 00:02:43,120
So great entrepreneurs arise out of that is OK.

41
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:47,790
This obviously is a business account you can see they have an email there.

42
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:48,180
OK.

43
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:49,920
So great.

44
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:53,090
And so then what I basically did was I contacted them.

45
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:58,050
I didn't actually contact these guys specifically but I hit the next button and it just gives you more

46
00:02:58,050 --> 00:02:59,340
and more and more like them.

47
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:04,230
And chances are all of these have the same thing going on.

48
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:11,920
So what I could do is just let's say they wanted to go to Hunter or entrepeneur 100 x success.

49
00:03:12,170 --> 00:03:12,890
Let's see.

50
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,790
And then what I could do is just message and say how much for a show.

51
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:18,940
OK.

52
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:20,510
That's really all I was doing.

53
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,310
And so what I came up with were.

54
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:29,460
See I got responses from three different people.

55
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:32,060
I said one of them was a smart success quote.

56
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:32,610
OK.

57
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:34,010
I just have a shot in the.

58
00:03:34,050 --> 00:03:35,010
What do you want.

59
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:41,160
Because they say you know specifically what exactly do you want in a story shout out do you want a permanent

60
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:41,760
shout out.

61
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:45,150
Or the caption a bio link.

62
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:45,950
There's a bunch right.

63
00:03:45,950 --> 00:03:50,730
We covered all of those so you need to be specific so I responded let's just say you know told our repots

64
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:53,510
with the caption tag I have yet to hear from you.

65
00:03:53,520 --> 00:03:58,210
It was an hour ago but I did get prices from inspiring DOS.

66
00:03:58,230 --> 00:04:03,420
They were pretty much ready for this template email so I could get a close shout out where they use

67
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:04,790
their own photo.

68
00:04:04,810 --> 00:04:09,900
But they put a link to us that's 10 bucks promotion with no link in the bio.

69
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:10,460
15.

70
00:04:10,470 --> 00:04:17,220
I think that just means that they post one of our posts and then they don't obviously link in the bio.

71
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:19,760
I don't know how long they leave it up so it's kind of hard to say.

72
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:28,200
Did they have things like story shout outs with clickable links and if for instance I wanted to promote

73
00:04:28,290 --> 00:04:31,890
a specific product they could link outside to that.

74
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,910
OK so these ones are pretty dang cheap.

75
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:36,540
And then the other one was entrepreneurs quote.

76
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:38,430
Turns out it's the same person who runs this.

77
00:04:38,430 --> 00:04:39,680
You can tell by the template.

78
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:46,260
So the same story really is a little slightly larger account so their prices were slightly larger.

79
00:04:46,710 --> 00:04:48,530
OK so I got some of that information.

80
00:04:48,550 --> 00:04:53,070
That's great and then what I did is I just created an Excel sheet and this is where I started putting

81
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:54,090
all of my information.

82
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:54,420
Right.

83
00:04:54,420 --> 00:04:58,130
So I have granite tech and I put the links over here.

84
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:01,720
PC technical philosophy says Brilliant right for us.

85
00:05:01,950 --> 00:05:04,680
You got to know what it is.

86
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,160
I listed off their followers.

87
00:05:06,210 --> 00:05:06,410
OK.

88
00:05:06,420 --> 00:05:10,950
And you can just usually grab these on the web page so this is my fault of the followers right there.

89
00:05:10,950 --> 00:05:14,540
Sometimes it's not accurate so it's useful to go to their page.

90
00:05:14,760 --> 00:05:16,750
So see granitic right here.

91
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:17,920
Yeah 194.

92
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:18,850
So it's accurate.

93
00:05:18,870 --> 00:05:21,640
Not all the time though worth checking so I did that.

94
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:27,030
Then I just kind of took a guess at what their demographics were.

95
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:29,390
And sometimes on these pages they'll tell you.

96
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:29,700
Right.

97
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:37,890
So it says right here 17 to 24 men and then they post in the morning and that's based on U.S. time zones.

98
00:05:37,890 --> 00:05:42,060
So I took all that information and I inputted it in.

99
00:05:42,060 --> 00:05:49,650
So male younger right after I put it this I just then went and checked to see if any of these accounts

100
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,990
just didn't fit because some of them just don't.

101
00:05:51,990 --> 00:05:59,580
And it turned out that for instance this one that did this is while his prices are reasonable I just

102
00:05:59,580 --> 00:06:06,330
kind of found out that his account right here it's if you look at it you're like oh ok that's cool.

103
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:11,830
You know people who are interested in cool sites nice photos and you click it and it's all Arabic.

104
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:12,200
OK.

105
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:14,880
So no offense to people who speak Arabic.

106
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,970
I just I'm trying to grow an English account so that's not useful to me.

107
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,250
Then I checked the other ones and everything else pretty much checked out some of these are right on

108
00:06:23,310 --> 00:06:28,410
the spot for my audience and their audience and some of these are kind of adjacent related souls so

109
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:33,280
that they know what I did was I stuck all these into auditor.

110
00:06:33,470 --> 00:06:40,800
I bought it for super useful tool and then got a score for them and also an engagement rate.

111
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:41,100
OK.

112
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:44,200
So for instance let's say Grand Attack OK.

113
00:06:44,220 --> 00:06:47,160
Their score was 70 which is good.

114
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:49,890
And then their engagement rate 2.2 percent.

115
00:06:49,890 --> 00:06:50,280
Right.

116
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,840
And then we can go here and put it all of that just there.

117
00:06:54,870 --> 00:06:56,120
Now 2.2 percent.

118
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:57,740
We go on engagement is actually good.

119
00:06:57,810 --> 00:06:58,190
OK.

120
00:06:58,370 --> 00:07:02,960
So usually average is 1.5 5 for their category.

121
00:07:02,970 --> 00:07:04,070
So that's good.

122
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:09,710
Then the scores basically tell me very quickly is that if I promote with them what type to follow is

123
00:07:09,790 --> 00:07:10,380
it made to get.

124
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:15,270
So if the score is pretty low it means I might get a lot of robot accounts mass followers or just people

125
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:18,030
who are sporadically active.

126
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:20,880
So that's something worth keeping in mind.

127
00:07:20,910 --> 00:07:28,230
Now what I did to make a decision or to give myself some clarity here was I put it the following things

128
00:07:28,350 --> 00:07:30,260
I put in their engagement right right here.

129
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:33,850
I knew what I did is I calculated the expected engagement.

130
00:07:34,140 --> 00:07:39,950
Now we did this calculation before and really all that was and this is napkin math it's not exact.

131
00:07:40,020 --> 00:07:45,090
It's not even remotely what I would expect but it's the only way we can compare them is I took their

132
00:07:45,090 --> 00:07:46,140
followers.

133
00:07:46,140 --> 00:07:49,470
Their engagement rate and that's the expected engagement.

134
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:54,180
So that just means on average when they post this is what you'd expect on a post.

135
00:07:54,180 --> 00:07:54,800
OK.

136
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:57,750
So then you can kind of see how this changes.

137
00:07:57,750 --> 00:07:58,070
Right.

138
00:07:58,070 --> 00:08:01,590
All while brilliant inventions is almost a million.

139
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:03,880
Their engagement rate is really low right.

140
00:08:03,910 --> 00:08:10,820
So it actually makes it a I expect less from them than say like for our success.

141
00:08:10,830 --> 00:08:12,380
This one's slightly.

142
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:13,200
Let's see.

143
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:18,450
And then you can also notice now like for instance if this place has seventy four thousand and it's

144
00:08:18,450 --> 00:08:22,540
only 1 percent now then you're not going to get a whole lot from that.

145
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:28,500
OK then what I did was I put in the cost for a two to four hour shower.

146
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,170
Now I had to find a base line for those.

147
00:08:31,170 --> 00:08:33,250
I had to find some common denominator.

148
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:37,550
Everybody offer something different some of them only offer story shout outs or some of them.

149
00:08:37,730 --> 00:08:39,540
Only do six hours and 12 hours.

150
00:08:39,540 --> 00:08:44,880
But the most common one I found was they'll give you a two hour three hour or a four hour.

151
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,450
And so I just went and found the price for all of those.

152
00:08:48,450 --> 00:08:50,160
Now one group didn't do that.

153
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,150
The smallest one they could offer was six hours.

154
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:55,230
So I just kind of shaved it down.

155
00:08:55,230 --> 00:08:57,540
So I took their price which was like 20.

156
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:04,410
And it was $30 and so I just knocked it down relative to what a three hour would be or a four would

157
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:07,650
be and that's kind of how I normalized this information here.

158
00:09:07,650 --> 00:09:08,440
OK.

159
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,910
So that's the cost of doing pretty much like the minimum type of post.

160
00:09:12,930 --> 00:09:16,290
And I honestly would not get this expect engagement if it's only for two hours.

161
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:19,450
These are all based on ones that have been up for probably a while.

162
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:25,700
So then what I did was I calculated my expected engagement per dollar.

163
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:26,530
So that was pretty easy.

164
00:09:26,540 --> 00:09:29,880
Then you just take this number divided by this number.

165
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:31,360
That's how you come up with this.

166
00:09:31,410 --> 00:09:37,980
So per dollar I spend I would expect to see 285 engagements now with them 129 76.

167
00:09:38,040 --> 00:09:42,200
So this really is the number one criteria I could care about.

168
00:09:42,210 --> 00:09:44,540
I want to get the most bang for my buck.

169
00:09:44,580 --> 00:09:51,120
So what is basically tells me is that some of these larger accounts like this one brilliant invention

170
00:09:51,150 --> 00:09:52,770
which is close to a million.

171
00:09:52,960 --> 00:09:55,370
It's terrible bang for your buck.

172
00:09:55,800 --> 00:10:02,280
It's almost a quarter as valuable as the or I would spend for instance grain attack.

173
00:10:02,350 --> 00:10:08,170
Now this data could be off but this is the only way we can really tell before we actually go and then

174
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:09,270
test them.

175
00:10:09,340 --> 00:10:11,800
Also running an audit on finest inventions.

176
00:10:11,830 --> 00:10:15,030
They have an insanely high engagement rate of five percent.

177
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,020
There are 11 million.

178
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:23,070
And I was just curious to see what they would have and what their prices would be.

179
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,750
I have to reach out to them on kik.

180
00:10:24,810 --> 00:10:29,400
OK so I went to their profile and they just said here's my email here's my kik and it says a business

181
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:33,450
for business inquiries so they clearly have this set up so I'll reach out to them.

182
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:35,500
And once I get that information I'll put that in here.

183
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:43,330
Once auditor is done calculating extreme PC and tech next week I can input this information.

184
00:10:43,330 --> 00:10:47,860
So tech next 55 for quality.

185
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,840
Three point one for it's actually quite good.

186
00:10:50,880 --> 00:11:01,640
So for them and they come in a roughly like a like number three now I get to try multiple these so don't

187
00:11:01,640 --> 00:11:05,000
really worry they're so cheap that why not.

188
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:06,920
I mean it's just it doesn't really hurt.

189
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:13,090
My only concern maybe is getting too many robot accounts because then when you start doing shout to

190
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:15,500
the people just your score will be lower.

191
00:11:15,530 --> 00:11:17,540
And that's just obnoxious.

192
00:11:17,570 --> 00:11:20,660
It's not a huge deal but we'll see.

193
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:25,850
And so what I'll try to do also is try to do a mass of one like a big time one and then I'll try to

194
00:11:25,850 --> 00:11:28,750
use some smaller more targeted ones and we can compare them.

195
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:30,360
Now here I just a shout out results.

196
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:36,350
What I'm gonna to do is put the name I going to put what I paid them and then I'm going to track for

197
00:11:36,350 --> 00:11:38,600
the period of time that that post was up.

198
00:11:38,630 --> 00:11:40,040
How many followers did I get.

199
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:40,660
Now I can do that.

200
00:11:40,660 --> 00:11:41,710
Nikonov Square.

201
00:11:41,750 --> 00:11:45,350
And then I can do expected engagement from a peer.

202
00:11:45,350 --> 00:11:49,870
I'll just put it down here and then I can see what the over under was so I can just I can you know how

203
00:11:49,870 --> 00:11:55,910
could it based on how many followers I got or how many Likes and Comments on the post it got.

204
00:11:56,030 --> 00:11:57,980
So now tell me how good the post is.

205
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:02,420
But this would tell me how many followers I got and then I can just say like was it 20 percent lower

206
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:04,730
than what I expected 50 percent lower or whatever.

207
00:12:04,730 --> 00:12:08,710
I just have to do it to the baseline and then I can kind of tweak from there.

208
00:12:08,870 --> 00:12:14,750
OK the last thing I would have to do is go and look at each account and what I would want to do is try

209
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:19,580
to look at their account and then see what post I have that would match them or if I have to make a

210
00:12:19,580 --> 00:12:23,090
new post like extreme PC it's all PCs.

211
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:31,680
So do I have a post on my account that is similar enough or is somehow about PCs.

212
00:12:31,820 --> 00:12:32,950
I'm going to probably guess.

213
00:12:32,960 --> 00:12:33,410
No.

214
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:34,590
That's like a hard one to do.

215
00:12:34,640 --> 00:12:38,480
But if I did let's say yeah mean Graham attack.

216
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,820
These are all kind of quirky cool tech.

217
00:12:41,840 --> 00:12:43,420
Now there's actually quite a few of them.

218
00:12:43,460 --> 00:12:48,770
And I would also go to whatever intellects tool we're using I'm using a kind of square and then look

219
00:12:48,770 --> 00:12:54,560
at my most engaging media and liked and commented just to get an idea of what performs in general because

220
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,780
I want to give them a good post good or bad post that I'm just not getting what I pay for.

221
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:02,630
So those are all the things that you have to take into consideration.

222
00:13:02,630 --> 00:13:05,710
I will go and run these and see how it works out.

223
00:13:05,900 --> 00:13:09,450
Then I will come back here and tell you what the results were.

224
00:13:09,560 --> 00:13:09,870
OK.

225
00:13:09,890 --> 00:13:10,280
Cool.

226
00:13:10,310 --> 00:13:11,000
See next picture.
