All right guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:05,460
So this lecture, what we're going to do is we're going to talk
about five different ways that you can up your comments.
2

3
00:00:05,460 --> 00:00:07,200
Now, why do we care about comments?
3

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:13,230
Well, comments are one of the criteria that Instagram
uses in their algorithm. We don't know if comments
4

5
00:00:13,290 --> 00:00:19,860
are as important as likes, or views, or saves,
but we do know that they're very important.
5

6
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:23,230
Typically speaking, if you look at
hashtag pages, look at the top posts,
6

7
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:25,650
those usually have a lot of comments.
7

8
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:31,020
Now, I don't know if that's indicative of just being a
high engagement post in general, but we know that
8

9
00:00:31,020 --> 00:00:35,100
there's a correlation between comments
and better treatment by Instagram.
9

10
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:38,100
Also worth pointing out that these five are not comprehensive.
10

11
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:40,620
There's a lot of different strategies
you can use to up your comments.
11

12
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:42,050
These are just the five that worked for me.
12

13
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:46,320
If you guys have something that worked for you, post
in the Q&A or the Slack and say what worked. I'm not
13

14
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:49,080
saying those don't work, I'm just saying this worked for me.
14

15
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,490
So the first one, and this is actually something we kind
of mentioned before, is respond to every single
15

16
00:00:53,490 --> 00:00:54,690
comment you get.
16

17
00:00:54,720 --> 00:00:59,180
It's very, very easy, especially at the very beginning,
when you're only getting 5 to 10 comments.
17

18
00:00:59,180 --> 00:01:02,110
Just go through and get in the habit
of responding to each one.
18

19
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:04,620
Now, the reason why is pretty obvious.
19

20
00:01:04,620 --> 00:01:08,880
This doubles your comments, and this does count
towards your engagement. Instagram doesn't care if it's
20

21
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,160
you commenting or the other person,
the random person, commenting,
21

22
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,300
they still give you a bump, so that's what we care about.
22

23
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,250
There's also a secondary benefit of if you respond,
23

24
00:01:18,250 --> 00:01:20,430
a lot of times people respond back to you,
24

25
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:23,720
so now instead of one comment you now have three. 
25

26
00:01:23,760 --> 00:01:28,870
The way I generally handle this is I just get in the habit of
responding maybe twice a day. If you're using Iconosquare,
26

27
00:01:28,890 --> 00:01:35,700
it's pretty easy to go and just go to their "Manage comments"
section and you can kind of do it all in one place
27

28
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:36,920
it's pretty easy to go and just go to their "Manage comments"
section and you can kind of do it all in one place
28

29
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,840
there, it's really hard to respond to people on the web version,
so you kind of have to do it with your phone, that's a pain,
29

30
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:43,830
that's why I usually use Iconosquare.
30

31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:48,540
Now, what do you do with the people that comment
and they're obviously just like mass follower accounts
31

32
00:01:48,570 --> 00:01:50,990
or maybe they're just really unoriginal commenters?
32

33
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:53,990
A lot of people respond with just an emoji, like a thumbs up.
33

34
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:56,760
I usually just respond back with another emoji.
34

35
00:01:56,760 --> 00:01:57,900
That's it. If they put a thumbs up,
35

36
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:04,530
give them an OK signal or give them a thumbs up. If it's
the case that they responded with just a set of emoijs,
36

37
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:05,440
give them an OK signal or give them a thumbs up. If it's
the case that they responded with just a set of emoijs,
37

38
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,800
I usually respond with a set of emojis, it takes
really no time at all and I usually just kind of have
38

39
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,810
a habit of dishing it back to them whatever they gave to me.
39

40
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:21,720
So number two strategy I use for upping comments is to always
respond, if you can, when this is relevant, with a question.
40

41
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:22,700
So number two strategy I use for upping comments is to always
respond, if you can, when this is relevant, with a question.
41

42
00:02:22,790 --> 00:02:23,550
Okay.
42

43
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,680
Now, this is obviously different than
just responding to every single person,
43

44
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,730
but when you can, try to respond with a question.
44

45
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:35,280
So if someone says, you know, on Innovation Station
we get this a lot, someone will say like "This innovation
45

46
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:36,720
is bad because [...]."
46

47
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,980
So a lot of times I'll just respond with "Why?" or "Why
do you think that?" You know, "This is what I think.
47

48
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,920
What do you think would happen if...?" You don't
really have to put a lot of thought into this, honestly.
48

49
00:02:46,950 --> 00:02:48,040
What do you think would happen if...?" You don't
really have to put a lot of thought into this, honestly.
49

50
00:02:48,150 --> 00:02:51,620
People love answering questions, so it's really simple.
50

51
00:02:51,630 --> 00:02:56,460
The benefit here is that you can start a thread of
comments really easily, especially if you're on the
51

52
00:02:56,460 --> 00:02:58,730
ball and you're checking this at least twice a day.
52

53
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,560
It's very easy to get one person to respond like
10 times, and also increases the likelihood that
53

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,970
they'll comment on the next post and hang around,
and that's how you kind of start snowballing support
54

55
00:03:09,630 --> 00:03:12,060
within your page and getting higher
and higher comment counts.
55

56
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:13,060
within your page and getting higher
and higher comment counts.
56

57
00:03:13,070 --> 00:03:17,830
Number three has to do with the call to action in your caption.
57

58
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,350
Now, a lot of your success with comments comes down to your call to action, and I am the first to admit that at Innovation Station
58

59
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:28,530
we don't have as many comments as we should have
we're probably below baseline, and that's mainly because
59

60
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:31,670
I haven't spent a lot of time trying
to optimize the call to action posts.
60

61
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,760
So if you are looking at the follow along section, you
can kind of see that. We still get a lot of comments,
61

62
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:41,550
but it's not really what you would expect, I think,
although our engagement rate's still very high.
62

63
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:47,280
So what you can do in those calls to action is use
something that frequently gets people to respond.
63

64
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,530
Now, there's two examples that I like, because
these always seem to get people to respond.
64

65
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,120
So like, number one is a fill in the blank statement.
65

66
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:03,000
So you could say "My favorite food is [...]" or "My favorite thing
about this post is..." and then people just fill in the blank.
66

67
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:04,180
So you could say "My favorite food is [...]" or "My favorite thing
about this post is..." and then people just fill in the blank.
67

68
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:09,800
Basically, the idea here is that you're trying to lower
the bar as low as possible for the commenter.
68

69
00:04:09,810 --> 00:04:15,360
People are lazy, and honestly, unless they feel really
strongly about making a comment, they're not going to.
69

70
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:15,600
People are lazy, and honestly, unless they feel really
strongly about making a comment, they're not going to.
70

71
00:04:15,600 --> 00:04:19,660
So if you set it up for them, "Hey,
this is fun, I can just add in my word."
71

72
00:04:19,740 --> 00:04:23,730
It's kind of like playing... not Mad Gabs, but it's like
Cards Against Humanity, where you literally
72

73
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:26,210
fill in a gap and people have fun with that.
73

74
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:29,010
Now, another way of doing it is a preference test.
74

75
00:04:29,100 --> 00:04:34,580
So if you post something, you can easily
just say ,"Do you like it or not? Tell us why."
75

76
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,160
And people, again, love to state their opinions.
76

77
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:38,930
Keep that in mind.
77

78
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,040
People love talking about what they like, why,
78

79
00:04:42,120 --> 00:04:42,880
People love talking about what they like, why,
79

80
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:46,410
and they just love talking out loud
to themselves, so facilitate that.
80

81
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:49,360
You also notice that some people's
entire posting strategy is around this.
81

82
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:52,140
They'll post two things and say, "A or B?
Which one do you like better?"
82

83
00:04:52,230 --> 00:04:53,310
They'll post two things and say, "A or B?
Which one do you like better?"
83

84
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,850
Coke or Pepsi kind of thing.
84

85
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,530
And typically, it's a very successful tactic.
85

86
00:04:57,540 --> 00:05:04,610
Number four, this is something I sometimes use, is you
can offer to shoutout the best comment on each post.
86

87
00:05:04,610 --> 00:05:10,280
So what you'd say at the very end is just "Shoutout to the
best comment" or "Shoutout to the top two comments"
87

88
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:15,590
and then all you have to do is, once you pick whoever the
best comment is, maybe the next day, doesn't really matter,
88

89
00:05:15,590 --> 00:05:16,420
and then all you have to do is, once you pick whoever the
best comment is, maybe the next day, doesn't really matter,
89

90
00:05:16,430 --> 00:05:21,080
you could either do one of two things. One, in the
next post, you could say "Shoutout to" and then tag
90

91
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,390
them, and people love that, or you can just edit the
post that they actually commented on and then put
91

92
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:28,030
their names at the very end.
92

93
00:05:28,030 --> 00:05:31,230
It's fairly simple, but people like social recognition.
93

94
00:05:31,240 --> 00:05:36,650
It's a big reason why Patreon is popular, because
a lot of YouTube creators will do Patreon
94

95
00:05:36,650 --> 00:05:40,920
campaigns and they'll say "Hey, if you pay me
$10 a month, I'll put your name on the screen."
95

96
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:43,880
That's really enticing to a lot of people.
96

97
00:05:43,880 --> 00:05:47,540
And the last one that's worked for me, number five,
is tagging a friend. So what you do at the very end is
97

98
00:05:47,540 --> 00:05:54,170
you just say "Tag a friend who" and it could be "who would
like this," "who would need this," "who would want this,"
98

99
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:58,760
"tag a friend who this reminds you of." The reason
why this ups your comments is it just brings
99

100
00:05:58,760 --> 00:06:01,790
more people into the thread. So they tag someone,
100

101
00:06:01,790 --> 00:06:05,840
well, that's one comment, but then if the friend responds,
that's another, and sometimes you can get these
101

102
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,280
people to go back and forth having conversations,
and even you can have third party people jumping into
102

103
00:06:10,280 --> 00:06:11,300
these conversations.
103

104
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,970
The whole point is you're just racking up comments by doing this.
104

105
00:06:13,970 --> 00:06:14,410
All right, guys.
105

106
00:06:14,410 --> 00:06:15,400
Those are the five.
106

107
00:06:15,410 --> 00:06:17,300
Number one, make sure you respond to everyone.
107

108
00:06:17,300 --> 00:06:23,180
Number two, when you can and it's relevant, ask a question
in return instead of just a standard statement response.
108

109
00:06:23,190 --> 00:06:24,390
Number two, when you can and it's relevant, ask a question
in return instead of just a standard statement response.
109

110
00:06:24,410 --> 00:06:30,620
Number three is use some type of call to action
that is really easy for them to participate in, like
110

111
00:06:30,620 --> 00:06:32,420
a preference test or a fill in the blank.
111

112
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:35,870
Number four and number five, we're
offering shoutouts for the best comments
112

113
00:06:35,870 --> 00:06:37,310
- people love social recognition -
113

114
00:06:37,320 --> 00:06:42,440
and the other one is asking people directly to tag their
friends, it brings more people into the comment thread,
114

115
00:06:42,440 --> 00:06:43,120
and the other one is asking people directly to tag their
friends, it brings more people into the comment thread,
115

116
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:45,330
that just means more people
are going to comment and you win.
116

117
00:06:45,410 --> 00:06:45,850
All right, guys.
117

118
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:46,700
See you in the next lecture.
