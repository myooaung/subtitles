All right guys, welcome back. This lecture,
1

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:07,650
we're going to tackle captions. Now, captions are the little bit of text that you see from the poster underneath the photo or video.
2

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,090
we're going to tackle captions. Now, captions are the little bit of text that you see from the poster underneath the photo or video.
3

4
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:14,660
A lot of people mistakenly think these are just comments,
because, well, they look exactly like comments.
4

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:17,460
I'm honestly not sure why they do it like that.
5

6
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,540
So when you're writing a caption, what exactly do we care about?
6

7
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,460
Captions are meant to be an auxiliary to your post.
7

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:25,190
They can explain what you posted,
8

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:27,770
they could complement the post and expand on it,
9

10
00:00:27,780 --> 00:00:32,640
they could simply tell the users how you made
the content, how you found it, or really anything.
10

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,110
Most commonly though you see is
either one, a reaction to the post,
11

12
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,780
this is especially common in comedy accounts,
and two, an explanation of the post.
12

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:45,570
Oftentimes a photo is of something
that just isn't in context.
13

14
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:46,170
So if you posted "I quit my job,"
well, you probably need to explain.
14

15
00:00:46,170 --> 00:00:47,340
So if you posted "I quit my job,"
well, you probably need to explain.
15

16
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:49,590
So if you posted "I quit my job,"
well, you probably need to explain.
16

17
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:52,280
And there's not enough space in the photo to do that.
17

18
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:54,390
Now the third thing I call expansions.
18

19
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:59,520
That's when you post a photo of your favorite place on
the beach to get your day drunk on and in the captions
19

20
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,030
That's when you post a photo of your favorite place on
the beach to get your day drunk on and in the captions
20

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,550
maybe you tell a story that goes along with
how you found it and what you love about it.
21

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:07,580
That thing with the captions is that
you really don't have a limit here.
22

23
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,620
They're kind of an exception to the
brevity rule we talked about before.
23

24
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:18,120
You wouldn't want to put a long rambling story in your
photo or video, but in the caption it's perfectly fine.
24

25
00:01:18,120 --> 00:01:18,650
You wouldn't want to put a long rambling story in your
photo or video, but in the caption it's perfectly fine.
25

26
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:25,380
Well, ok, there is technically a limit, and it's
2,200 characters, which is like half a page,
26

27
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:27,860
if you are using a regular Word doc, single spaced.
27

28
00:01:27,900 --> 00:01:32,430
You don't need to fill that, and I seriously doubt you'll
ever really have to contend with this issue ever.
28

29
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:33,010
You don't need to fill that, and I seriously doubt you'll
ever really have to contend with this issue ever.
29

30
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:35,550
But for the most part, you have a free range here.
30

31
00:01:35,630 --> 00:01:40,410
If you make a super long post, it's not going to turn off
your followers who are obsessed with quick learning 
31

32
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:41,610
and quick engagement.
32

33
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,530
Captions are a perfect self-selection tool. After
a certain limit, it's usually like 10 to 12 words,
33

34
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,970
Captions are a perfect self-selection tool. After
a certain limit, it's usually like 10 to 12 words,
34

35
00:01:47,970 --> 00:01:49,920
the caption gets a dot dot dot.
35

36
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,310
So if you want to read the rest, you have to expand the caption.
36

37
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:57,300
People browse it, see that first part, and then
they decide if they want to go further.
37

38
00:01:57,420 --> 00:02:01,460
If it's too long, they just move on,
and they don't ding you for it.
38

39
00:02:01,630 --> 00:02:06,450
If you have a user who is totally into what you're writing
about out, then they will, and all the better for that user.
39

40
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:07,240
If you have a user who is totally into what you're writing
about out, then they will, and all the better for that user.
40

41
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:12,900
So with that being said, I prefer long captions, multiple
paragraphs. One sentence is just not enough, unless
41

42
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,800
you're going for comedic effect, or
answering a question your post asked.
42

43
00:02:16,830 --> 00:02:20,190
It just looks like you don't care and that
you're not putting effort into your post.
43

44
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:23,220
If you're not putting in effort, then why
should others care and follow you?
44

45
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:27,810
So with that being said, take advantage of the
minority of users that are really interested.
45

46
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:33,540
Remember, we live and die by the algorithm, and what
does the algorithm care about? Engagement rate and
46

47
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,670
time on post. Longer captains will make some users read longer, thereby extending the average time spent on the post.
47

48
00:02:38,670 --> 00:02:39,540
time on post. Longer captains will make some users read longer, thereby extending the average time spent on the post.
48

49
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,320
People that read more are more likely to engage,
thereby raising the potential engagement.
49

50
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:46,290
So how can you make your caption long?
50

51
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,080
What exactly do you write about?
51

52
00:02:48,130 --> 00:02:50,610
Well, one way to do it would be to tell a story.
52

53
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,200
Human beings are wired such that stories are our
preferred form of information consumption.
53

54
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,110
Would you rather read a list of facts about a
business or hear the story of how it started?
54

55
00:02:59,170 --> 00:03:03,000
So an easy way to do this is just to find
a story, even if it's not that remarkable,
55

56
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:06,740
it can still be worth telling because it shows
your account as authentic and human.
56

57
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:08,040
You can make a story honestly of anything.
57

58
00:03:08,050 --> 00:03:09,090
You can make a story honestly of anything.
58

59
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:10,060
Selling makeup?
59

60
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:14,490
OK, let's say you post a photo of a mix
of makeups that you have on someone.
60

61
00:03:14,490 --> 00:03:17,320
You can tell the story of the model putting it on.
61

62
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:22,530
You can talk about how you discovered this mix, you can
tell stories about customers that love the combination,
62

63
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:28,780
you can tell stories about frustrated people you know who
can't figure out makeup, and then used this, I don't know,
63

64
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:30,050
there's a lot of options.
64

65
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:35,130
Let's say your account is, I don't know,
let's say it's for promoting events.
65

66
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:37,220
You can show a photo of an event.
66

67
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:42,960
OK, now, in the caption, tell a story of something that
happened at the event, something that happened at
67

68
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:44,740
the last event, the prior one,
68

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,050
something funny someone said, why you started
the event or why the founder started it,
69

70
00:03:50,100 --> 00:03:54,900
how you discovered the event, how the event usually
progresses, whatever, there's a lot of options.
70

71
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:58,190
If they're interested in your account there's
a good chance they'll care about this.
71

72
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:01,280
Maybe you're a logo designer and
you're showing off your logos.
72

73
00:04:01,290 --> 00:04:03,950
Tell them what you were thinking of with the design,
73

74
00:04:03,950 --> 00:04:04,900
what it reminds you of,
74

75
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:10,890
and hey, if there's anything personal in there about why you
love a certain color or how it evokes a certain memory.
75

76
00:04:10,890 --> 00:04:11,550
and hey, if there's anything personal in there about why you
love a certain color or how it evokes a certain memory.
76

77
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:16,380
That's always a plus, because people like comments that
show you're human and not just some corporate account.
77

78
00:04:16,380 --> 00:04:17,110
That's always a plus, because people like comments that
show you're human and not just some corporate account.
78

79
00:04:17,340 --> 00:04:20,310
So there's an infinite number of things that you can write about.
79

80
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:22,410
You're the person who came up with the post.
80

81
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:25,740
So what do you think is interesting about the piece?
81

82
00:04:25,740 --> 00:04:31,050
Chances are, that's what other people will also find interesting.
At a minimum put something valuable in the caption.
82

83
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:31,930
Chances are, that's what other people will also find interesting.
At a minimum put something valuable in the caption.
83

84
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,210
A story, an anecdote, a fact, a funny comment.
84

85
00:04:36,210 --> 00:04:38,830
It gives them two reasons to like the photo.
85

86
00:04:38,850 --> 00:04:41,190
They can like the photo or like the caption.
86

87
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:46,730
Now, let's talk about some tips and tricks that
can really help you to bump up your captions.
87

88
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:48,740
These are my favorite things worth doing.
88

89
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:51,670
Now, the first thing is to be aware of
what your text wall looks like.
89

90
00:04:51,690 --> 00:04:55,330
No one likes a block of text with no spaces or visual breakup.
90

91
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:57,420
Break up your thoughts in easy to read chunks.
91

92
00:04:57,420 --> 00:05:03,150
My favorite thing to do is even put line breaks in
the post to break up what they're reading. I might
92

93
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,550
have a couple sentences intro, then a line break,
then a list of five things I thought were interesting,
93

94
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:14,730
or tips for whatever. To do a line break, write your
post again in Notes, or if you're an Android person,
94

95
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:17,640
I think you can do it really on anything that takes notes.
95

96
00:05:17,750 --> 00:05:23,220
Before we did a Google doc. Evernote, for example, you put underscores for your lines and then copy that back into Instagram.
96

97
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:24,470
Before we did a Google doc. Evernote, for example, you put underscores for your lines and then copy that back into Instagram.
97

98
00:05:24,480 --> 00:05:29,100
Next thing, sometimes your post might go on and on,
and that's perfectly fine, but if you're going to do
98

99
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:32,990
that, consider putting periods to make
each line break instead of a blank space.
99

100
00:05:33,150 --> 00:05:37,200
That way, Instagram randomly blocks
off your text below the screenfold,
100

101
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:41,020
sometimes users might not know that the
rest of the message actually keeps on going.
101

102
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:43,140
And you'll notice a lot of people do this.
102

103
00:05:43,140 --> 00:05:46,980
Tip number three, don't ever put hashtags
in your caption, just don't do it.
103

104
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:50,520
Looks awful and makes you kind of look
like you have no idea what you're doing.
104

105
00:05:50,520 --> 00:05:54,330
You put them in the comments, and
that's, well, we'll talk about that later.
105

106
00:05:54,330 --> 00:05:59,670
Tip number four, if you don't have anyone to
tag in your caption, then tag yourself at the end.
106

107
00:05:59,670 --> 00:06:04,540
So it says @ your own username as
the last thing on the caption. Now why?
107

108
00:06:04,590 --> 00:06:09,150
Because a lot of people who don't follow you will read
the post, and if you wrote a decent caption, there's
108

109
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:12,750
a good chance they'll click through that tag to your profile.
109

110
00:06:12,750 --> 00:06:17,430
That's what we want and that's how we get people to
like multiple photos and follow us more frequently.
110

111
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:21,930
You can tag yourself in the photo, but no one
really sees that. Tip number five and the last one,
111

112
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:25,290
believe it or not, you can put website URLs in your comments.
112

113
00:06:25,350 --> 00:06:28,920
Yes, you can just write the name of
your website in there if you so please.
113

114
00:06:28,920 --> 00:06:32,790
It's just not going to show up as a clickable link, which
means that fewer people will actually go to it,
114

115
00:06:32,790 --> 00:06:32,930
It's just not going to show up as a clickable link, which
means that fewer people will actually go to it,
115

116
00:06:32,940 --> 00:06:34,470
But hey, who cares?
116

117
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,880
Any attention is better than none.
117

118
00:06:35,970 --> 00:06:40,740
So, for instance, if you go to foreverjobless, that account, you
can see that Billy does this in pretty much every post, and
118

119
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:41,180
So, for instance, if you go to foreverjobless, that account, you
can see that Billy does this in pretty much every post, and
119

120
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,140
I think for the most part it works. All right, in the resources
we've attached captions that we think are worth
120

121
00:06:46,140 --> 00:06:50,730
reading, at least for inspiration. You'll generally find that
popular accounts have a special style for their captions.
121

122
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:51,820
reading, at least for inspiration. You'll generally find that
popular accounts have a special style for their captions.
122

123
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,190
Kind of their signature.
