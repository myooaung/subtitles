00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,730
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:05,940
OK so this lecture we're going to do is what are you what we've been doing for stories at innovation

3
00:00:05,940 --> 00:00:06,430
station.

4
00:00:06,450 --> 00:00:11,490
I can show you the two different types that we were have been trying and give you a little insight into

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:12,920
why we changed it.

6
00:00:13,260 --> 00:00:13,470
OK.

7
00:00:13,470 --> 00:00:18,720
So with our story strategy is pretty straightforward we just saw it as a way to bring engagement to

8
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:24,630
my regular posts so what I did was I just posted a story every single time there was a post and I was

9
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,650
it was just a preview of it.

10
00:00:26,670 --> 00:00:32,040
And then the idea was to bring people in and they go check out my post and hopefully engage and then

11
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:33,640
hopefully look at other posts.

12
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:40,550
You're the only thing I did was I made a little intro and outro sequences.

13
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:44,800
So the idea was posting the top of the day or the top of the week.

14
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:47,830
And so I kind of wanted to preface that with people first.

15
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,610
Although in retrospect it's something I probably could have dropped actually because it's kind of unnecessary.

16
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:54,380
So it looks something like this.

17
00:00:54,390 --> 00:00:57,620
All right so top innovations of the day September 5th right.

18
00:00:58,050 --> 00:01:01,980
Then the outro would look like this and say see of the videos at.

19
00:01:02,010 --> 00:01:03,510
And then it says swipe up to watch.

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,360
Now swiping up.

21
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,690
I can't do it I'm on my account but what it would do is it would take you to my account.

22
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:10,050
And again that's not ideal.

23
00:01:10,050 --> 00:01:15,420
I need to update that reality it should just be I should just tag myself there and have it so they can

24
00:01:15,420 --> 00:01:16,720
click it and then go.

25
00:01:16,740 --> 00:01:22,260
Now for the longest time this is how we did our stories what we were doing is we would take our posts

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:27,060
and since our posts were square videos we would then turn them into a story version.

27
00:01:27,060 --> 00:01:32,370
So in order to do that kind of how to start from the very beginning where people were writing captions

28
00:01:32,370 --> 00:01:33,660
about their posts.

29
00:01:33,660 --> 00:01:40,590
So if you look at this as our Trello showing the progress we've been making with captions and I can

30
00:01:40,590 --> 00:01:41,930
show you an example.

31
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:45,540
We for instance here is a game that inoculates people from fake news.

32
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:47,110
This is the person who posted.

33
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:50,970
This is the person who always puts their hashtags just for reference.

34
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,470
This is a person who works on the captions.

35
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:53,130
Now what.

36
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:58,650
I had them do was write a full caption and we talked about this and the content strategy section but

37
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,530
then I just had to add a one sentence summary.

38
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,300
Now the idea was that we were going to post the videos as stories with a one sentence summary and that

39
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,930
if people were interested in it enough they could then go look at the videos all the videos are longer

40
00:02:09,930 --> 00:02:11,160
than 15 seconds.

41
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,740
They're like 45 seconds something like that whereas a story can only be 15 so it's probably like a teaser

42
00:02:16,770 --> 00:02:18,360
and then they'd move over to it.

43
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:21,000
That was the way that we thought it would work.

44
00:02:21,240 --> 00:02:25,250
So I can show you kind of what the end result kind of looked like.

45
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:28,190
Let's see so let's say July 1st 2013.

46
00:02:28,460 --> 00:02:32,640
It would start with top innovations of the day July 1st.

47
00:02:33,030 --> 00:02:34,890
Nothing too surprising here.

48
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:40,240
So that would wash away as there always are a short like five seconds.

49
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:41,300
They don't go to like this.

50
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:47,960
So we would have the same video that we use as the post but it only have one sentence as opposed to

51
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:53,680
multiple sentences one sentence corresponded to the summary that the person wrote then at the bottom

52
00:02:53,730 --> 00:02:59,720
we would do is we put the logo innovation station just to make sure that people knew this as it was.

53
00:02:59,720 --> 00:03:03,840
We just use a generic background for the back has the same background that we had used in the intro

54
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,870
and outros and then we just did that for every single video.

55
00:03:05,870 --> 00:03:10,190
It was really easy because if you're an editor was making a video pick very easily just then copy and

56
00:03:10,190 --> 00:03:14,870
paste it into a different template that was taller or like a portrait mode video and then just snap

57
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:16,540
and these icons really quickly.

58
00:03:16,550 --> 00:03:19,780
And it really didn't take any time and we used the same music too.

59
00:03:19,790 --> 00:03:21,590
So there wasn't a big change at all.

60
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:30,890
So it would look something kind of like this Bob you're a very quick simple flip and then say the sentence

61
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:34,080
you can read it and then we kind of moved on and it took a lot of back and forth to figure out what

62
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:39,270
period we could show that it wasn't so long they didn't feel like they had to go look at the post.

63
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:41,730
But it also wasn't so short that they couldn't read it.

64
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:45,030
So that was kind of the style that we were doing for a while.

65
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,510
But what we essentially started doing is simplifying it because I added a feature where you can just

66
00:03:51,600 --> 00:03:57,270
share a post and it automatically gives you a template for the posts and that is way easier and people

67
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,270
respond to it better.

68
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:05,790
So as opposed to doing it like that what you can do is just go to an individual post and then down here

69
00:04:05,790 --> 00:04:08,540
where you have the paper airplane press that and says share.

70
00:04:08,550 --> 00:04:11,670
Now all I have to do is actually just say add post to your story.

71
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:14,890
So I click that and then automatically it creates a background for me.

72
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:19,620
It puts my tag right there and it shows that it's a playable video so it makes it incredibly easy for

73
00:04:19,620 --> 00:04:21,030
people to click through.

74
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:25,980
This is a great strategy also if you're posting someone else's post because you can do the same thing

75
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:29,070
and put it in your story and then highlight it and say Hey check this out.

76
00:04:29,070 --> 00:04:32,940
And then it was a matter of just putting in some hash tags that fit with it.

77
00:04:32,970 --> 00:04:40,020
So we could say something like I don't know computers at the top of the bottom doesn't really matter.

78
00:04:40,110 --> 00:04:46,080
And then you know we like tag some people or something like that or we might even put text up at the

79
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:51,730
top or bottom so we could very easily say like check it out and throw that up at the top.

80
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:52,650
So that was really easy.

81
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:56,820
I mean I could easily throw this up right after I made a post and especially if I'm doing the same thing

82
00:04:56,820 --> 00:04:59,370
every single time it makes it really easy.

83
00:04:59,370 --> 00:05:02,600
The last thing I might do is just tag myself.

84
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:04,920
Just give them an extra thing to click on.

85
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,690
So long as you're not trying to be too cluttered obviously.

86
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:10,640
So I could put it like that if I wanted to and there you go.

87
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:12,710
Then I get send that and that's what we've been doing.

88
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,680
Much much easier.

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:14,820
Looks better.

90
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:20,080
And when we look at our stats actually people are responding to this a lot better.

91
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:26,460
Now we can look at our analytics for our stories and I can kind of show you what the general trend has

92
00:05:26,460 --> 00:05:27,060
been.

93
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:29,990
So we look at the past year.

94
00:05:30,070 --> 00:05:31,310
I haven't been doing this for a year.

95
00:05:31,320 --> 00:05:35,250
So this is pretty much everything you post posted 661 stories.

96
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:41,280
That's largely because we started this a month or two after we did regular posts but we know you were

97
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:44,160
posting several a day so it kind of makes sense.

98
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,130
Total photos total videos for the most part we were just posting the videos and not the quotes just

99
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,180
because we didn't think the quotes were engaging enough average stories per day 2.7 sorority's history

100
00:05:55,550 --> 00:05:56,350
yada.

101
00:05:56,670 --> 00:06:01,300
So our total impression is 1.2 million that's pretty good average impressions on point 1.9.

102
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:03,720
So as you can see here our reach.

103
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:09,810
It's hard to kind of tell but it is a very steady slower upward trajectory so that either means that

104
00:06:09,810 --> 00:06:16,440
people over time are finding these useful or the account is just growing larger and therefore more people

105
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:20,670
are seeing the stories every single day.

106
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:22,730
Down here is the average completion rate.

107
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:25,920
Ninety five point seven percent decently good.

108
00:06:25,920 --> 00:06:29,160
Now this is all screwed up because Ill say highest Screecher most completed.

109
00:06:29,370 --> 00:06:33,220
And obviously it's going be the first one right because everyone sees the first story.

110
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,640
So it it's also the shortest So it kind of makes sense that they would be most likely to get through

111
00:06:38,640 --> 00:06:38,720
it.

112
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:40,980
So a lot of this isn't terribly useful.

113
00:06:41,010 --> 00:06:42,680
This one story is no tap backs.

114
00:06:42,690 --> 00:06:46,140
I think this is just because maybe this one was a little more confusing or something like that.

115
00:06:46,200 --> 00:06:46,470
Yeah.

116
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:52,520
So for the most part our average restraint rate there is 13 percent which is pretty good.

117
00:06:52,710 --> 00:06:57,360
It's kind of hard to say some accounts do better with their stories it's been a lot of time in their

118
00:06:57,360 --> 00:06:58,110
stories.

119
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,070
One problem is that we've been doing the same thing over and over again so people kind of get used to

120
00:07:02,070 --> 00:07:02,470
it.

121
00:07:02,610 --> 00:07:07,800
But of course on the flip side some people get used to it and expect it so frequently will consume it.

122
00:07:07,800 --> 00:07:12,000
So this is what we've been using it for for the most part I think it has increased engagement quite

123
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:12,780
a bit.

124
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:16,820
I think it's worth doing mainly because it's just an extra 5 percent effort.

125
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:18,580
It's really not particularly hard.

126
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:22,380
So if you have someone else doing this for you you can just write it into their schedule it's just one

127
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:23,500
more thing they can do.

128
00:07:23,550 --> 00:07:28,590
But I will say I don't think stories are a big part of our strategy it's just kind of nice to have it

129
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:33,810
makes people look at and go oh this is a more active and well put together account versus ones that

130
00:07:33,810 --> 00:07:35,010
say don't have a story.

131
00:07:35,010 --> 00:07:38,640
All right guys with that being said next hour we'll talk about some of the best practices stories and

132
00:07:38,670 --> 00:07:40,050
we'll move on from this action.

133
00:07:40,050 --> 00:07:40,530
See you then.
