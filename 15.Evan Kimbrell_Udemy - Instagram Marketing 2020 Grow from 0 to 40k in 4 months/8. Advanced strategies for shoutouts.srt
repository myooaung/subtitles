00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:05,520
You guys welcome back OK this lecture we're going to do is we're going to talk about some odds and ends

2
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,860
to the shout out growth strategy.

3
00:00:08,910 --> 00:00:14,130
There are some tactics out there that I would consider a little more advanced but I also consider them

4
00:00:14,130 --> 00:00:16,700
pretty creative and creativity.

5
00:00:16,910 --> 00:00:21,720
I mean it's a big factor in whether or not you're successful on Instagram and especially with some of

6
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,340
these growth remedies like shout outs.

7
00:00:23,330 --> 00:00:25,260
Shutouts are pretty simple on the surface right.

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:32,380
You just repots someone else's stuff and then you tag them in the caption and Mimi in the photo.

9
00:00:32,670 --> 00:00:39,300
It's sometimes you know dawn on a shared share basis so you do one they do one sometimes you buy them

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:39,750
right.

11
00:00:39,900 --> 00:00:42,570
Well there's other ways of using this as well.

12
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:45,050
And that's what we're going to cover in this lecture.

13
00:00:45,060 --> 00:00:50,190
So I have four obscurer strategies that hopefully will stoke some creativity and if you're up for it

14
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:50,940
try it out.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:55,940
All right so the first strategy is the one day unsolicited shout out strategy.

16
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:02,760
So one thing I've seen work pretty well with newer accounts is in the first 30 to 60 days you're not

17
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,890
gonna have enough followers to be able to do these one to one shout out so you even get the attention

18
00:01:07,890 --> 00:01:09,930
of some of the larger accounts.

19
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:13,620
So it might feel like I just can't use this strategy at all.

20
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:17,540
Well one thing you can do is set on your habit schedule.

21
00:01:17,550 --> 00:01:22,520
Go to your To Do list of your momentum or whatever and set that every single day for the first day like

22
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:28,500
30 days you're going to make an unsolicited shout out an unsolicited one would be you post someone else's

23
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:34,170
stuff and then you can and you tag them in the captions and you just do that one sided entirely.

24
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:40,390
What that does is it allows you to start building a relationship with some of the accounts that later

25
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:45,590
on you'll want to actually do some collaborative back and forth with.

26
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,380
Now there's only really works if you pick accounts that are really squarely in your niche.

27
00:01:50,400 --> 00:01:56,190
And if they're posting things that you legitimately think your audience will enjoy.

28
00:01:56,190 --> 00:02:00,480
If that's the case then you can pretty much get away with anything you want.

29
00:02:00,480 --> 00:02:06,330
What's great about this though is that sometimes there are big accounts out there and millions of followers

30
00:02:06,600 --> 00:02:10,710
and you think to yourself I'm never going to be able to get shouted out on their account.

31
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:16,650
Well in some cases when you do unsolicited shout outs it's not actually uncommon that a large account

32
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:22,500
likes what you did and returns the favor certainly because you put the foot forward and didn't really

33
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:24,280
ask for anything in return.

34
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:27,710
But also if that doesn't happen I know that's like hitting the lottery.

35
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:30,480
It also gets their attention and starts that relationship.

36
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,970
I mean you can comment on someone's post you can like it.

37
00:02:34,030 --> 00:02:34,950
You can follow them.

38
00:02:34,950 --> 00:02:36,260
They get notifications for that.

39
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:42,510
But tagging someone reposting their own post that actually is something that can get their attention

40
00:02:42,540 --> 00:02:44,160
and you kind of build the relationship from there.

41
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,020
Now if you do that for 30 days you could easily have 15 accounts ready to work with.

42
00:02:49,020 --> 00:02:50,850
You've already started a relationship with.

43
00:02:50,850 --> 00:02:54,360
So you can kind of bust out the gate past that point.

44
00:02:54,360 --> 00:03:00,300
This leads me into one of a weirder strategies I've seen when you tag someone in a repost.

45
00:03:00,300 --> 00:03:03,460
What'll happen is it'll show up on their profile.

46
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:05,900
And the little tab or chose mentions.

47
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:06,860
OK.

48
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,210
One thing you can do and it's hard to pull off but if you do it it actually can work pretty well is

49
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:17,010
you take an account that you really wish would shout you out right and they have lots of followers and

50
00:03:17,010 --> 00:03:21,480
they're similar enough to you if you'd like Konno square which you covered before you can actually see

51
00:03:21,510 --> 00:03:23,650
when they post most often.

52
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:30,330
And if you time your reposts and your tag with when they post their post what can actually happen is

53
00:03:30,330 --> 00:03:36,450
they'll bring in thousands and thousands of viewers to their page who might then bounce to their profile

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,640
and then see the mentioned post.

55
00:03:38,650 --> 00:03:40,880
It's like I said really hard to pull off.

56
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,040
But if you can do it it can actually be a sweet boost.

57
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,560
All right now the second strategy is using shout outs to incentivize engagement.

58
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:55,500
Now it's not just for getting other accounts to give you you know some free exposure you could actually

59
00:03:55,500 --> 00:04:00,570
use it to get people to give you better comments or to tag other friends.

60
00:04:00,570 --> 00:04:06,470
So for instance you know you see that stuff all the time like best commande gets blank.

61
00:04:06,570 --> 00:04:07,980
Well you can do.

62
00:04:08,020 --> 00:04:09,800
I'll show you out in the next comment.

63
00:04:09,830 --> 00:04:11,660
Best who ever makes the best comment.

64
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:16,830
OK that's another very common way of doing it that gets people who are just sitting there thinking about

65
00:04:16,830 --> 00:04:21,240
the post who like the post but have nothing to say given that it's enough to actually jump in and do

66
00:04:21,240 --> 00:04:21,660
something.

67
00:04:21,690 --> 00:04:23,860
You can even do it kind of like a lottery too.

68
00:04:23,880 --> 00:04:28,860
So some people see it and be like oh this guy wrote three paragraphs and I can write anything.

69
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:34,470
So you could say is I'll randomly pick two people out of my comment list and shout them out in the next

70
00:04:34,470 --> 00:04:34,730
one.

71
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,180
And that kind of evens it out so you just get people posting anything.

72
00:04:40,230 --> 00:04:45,360
The point is it gives you more engagement that increases your engagement rate that then increases the

73
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:48,960
reach of your post and Instagram's algorithm thinks you're a better account now.

74
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:51,080
An alternative way of doing it would be those.

75
00:04:51,090 --> 00:04:58,290
Tag a friend who you know needs this product that I'm featuring or Tag a friend who you know this reminds

76
00:04:58,290 --> 00:05:05,580
you of what you can do things like I'll shout out whoever tags the most people so you could say tag

77
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:07,060
friends who need this.

78
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:09,050
I'll shout out whoever tags most people.

79
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,330
That's a very common one.

80
00:05:10,330 --> 00:05:13,030
To do let's say you have like a makeup account right.

81
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:15,410
And you say tag your friend who needs whatever.

82
00:05:15,480 --> 00:05:17,790
OK maybe it's an actually interesting product.

83
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:22,530
You're going to get lucky and hit the jackpot with someone who has like 15 valley girl friends who will

84
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:26,060
tag all of them because not only would they actually be interested in it.

85
00:05:26,070 --> 00:05:29,610
Now they have the incentive to actually sit there and do the tagging.

86
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:33,810
All right obscure strategy number three and these are called shout out groups.

87
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:38,640
Now later on we'll talk a little bit about things like engagement pods and effectively what these are

88
00:05:39,030 --> 00:05:46,080
groups that you get together who are in similar ish enough spaces who all work together to help each

89
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:48,440
other increasing Ajman of their posts.

90
00:05:48,450 --> 00:05:53,630
They do it by liking each other's posts or commenting on them or in some cases sharing them.

91
00:05:53,790 --> 00:06:00,990
Well a shout out group specifically is when you get together with a group of people and every single

92
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:06,060
person takes turns posting one of their posts in the group and then when they do that everyone else

93
00:06:06,060 --> 00:06:08,130
has agreed to read post them.

94
00:06:08,130 --> 00:06:13,680
So what ends up happening is on Monday one person gets shouted out to say nine other accounts of 10

95
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:17,640
people in the group and twos that's the next person's turn wins the next person's turn.

96
00:06:17,640 --> 00:06:22,140
Now why is this different than just getting a group of 10 people and you guys reach out every single

97
00:06:22,140 --> 00:06:23,540
time someone post something.

98
00:06:23,730 --> 00:06:27,750
Well it's because it concentrates the attention on one post at a time.

99
00:06:27,750 --> 00:06:36,000
So if you did one every single day and someone just you know you only got one shout out for each post

100
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:37,780
but you got it for every single one.

101
00:06:37,890 --> 00:06:40,170
Well I mean that gives you a boost and that's nice.

102
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:46,470
But if you had nine people hit one specific post that's enough of a concentration to raise your engagement

103
00:06:46,470 --> 00:06:52,210
rate to actually push that post out to new people doesn't really work the other way around.

104
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:56,470
How exactly you go about doing this is kind of up to you.

105
00:06:56,550 --> 00:07:00,960
There aren't really public groups that you can do this where it is usually for accounts that have worked

106
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:07,380
together before trust each other or you're friends with them or Usually it's between more established

107
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:08,180
accounts.

108
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:12,990
So as you start getting followers you start posting things you actually have a little bit of a tracker.

109
00:07:13,140 --> 00:07:17,320
You can actually reach out to people and say do you want to start you know a shout out group.

110
00:07:17,330 --> 00:07:20,470
Does it have to be 10 people you could just do it with four or five people.

111
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:22,140
It still has the same effect.

112
00:07:22,140 --> 00:07:27,090
All right now the fourth and the last I'm scared what I'm going to mention are mentioned shout outs.

113
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:31,590
Now this is kind of strange and it's not necessarily something I endorse but I've seen it work and it's

114
00:07:31,590 --> 00:07:35,450
something that if you feel like it just look into it and see what works for you.

115
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:41,010
What some people do is they'll go right for they make a post they'll go to a competitor and look at

116
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:47,400
their followers list or look at who are their most active commenters or like yours or something like

117
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:47,940
that.

118
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:49,800
And then all the deals are compiled list of those.

119
00:07:49,830 --> 00:07:55,440
And then when they post a photo in the actual photo tag they'll tag a bunch of them.

120
00:07:55,530 --> 00:08:01,260
OK what that does is you pre-select a bunch of people who probably like your stuff because your competitor

121
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:03,100
probably posts similar things to you.

122
00:08:03,150 --> 00:08:08,370
You bring them over to your section because they get a very unique notification saying you are literally

123
00:08:08,370 --> 00:08:09,120
tagged in a photo.

124
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,060
That's not something an average person sees every single day.

125
00:08:12,060 --> 00:08:18,900
They come over and their likelihood of actually posting or commenting or liking goes up considerably.

126
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:27,630
So it's one way of maybe grabbing 20 people or 30 people who have a very high chance of engaging with

127
00:08:27,630 --> 00:08:28,130
your post.

128
00:08:28,130 --> 00:08:31,110
So it almost kind of sets a baseline for each one.

129
00:08:31,130 --> 00:08:35,370
It's one of those ones you happy kind of careful with though because some companies out there I've seen

130
00:08:35,370 --> 00:08:37,610
people do it with several thousand.

131
00:08:37,770 --> 00:08:42,420
And it's something that the Instagram algorithm will look for because at that point you're kind of abusing

132
00:08:42,420 --> 00:08:43,730
it and missing the point.

133
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:48,990
I think you could probably get away with like 50 but anything above that anyone who clicks the photos

134
00:08:48,990 --> 00:08:55,060
just can't notice that you're clearly using this as like a cheap strategy to grab people below that.

135
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:59,850
It's actually a kind of a nice way to pull in people who you think really might actually like the photo.

136
00:08:59,850 --> 00:09:00,260
All right guys.

137
00:09:00,260 --> 00:09:03,260
Those are four strategies I think worth looking into.

138
00:09:03,270 --> 00:09:07,770
They're more advanced and they're harder to pull off but they're definitely creative and they're definitely

139
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:08,290
interesting.

140
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:08,580
All right.

141
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:09,220
That being said.

142
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:10,020
See your next lecture.
