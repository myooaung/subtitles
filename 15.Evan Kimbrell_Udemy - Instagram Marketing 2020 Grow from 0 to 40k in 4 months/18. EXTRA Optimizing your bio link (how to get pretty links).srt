00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,760
Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:07,980
OK, so this lecture, what we're going to talk about is
how to get a good looking link in your Instagram profile.
2

3
00:00:08,010 --> 00:00:13,470
I said this a hundred times, so much of your business and
so much of the point of making an Instagram account
3

4
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:18,460
runs through that one singular link that
you're allowed to put in your bio.
4

5
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:19,890
And since it's so important,
5

6
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:22,680
then the question becomes, how do we optimize that?
6

7
00:00:22,780 --> 00:00:27,260
Well, that's what we're going to talk about in this
lecture, and there's a couple tricks that you can do.
7

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:35,130
Now, the first thing I'll point out is that just in general
with landing page conversion, having a link that
8

9
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:39,350
looks like the name of your profile
is generally a good thing.
9

10
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:39,660
looks like the name of your profile
is generally a good thing.
10

11
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:45,930
So Innovation Station, if I had innovationstation.com,
I could put that as the link and that is perfectly fine.
11

12
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:46,520
So Innovation Station, if I had innovationstation.com,
I could put that as the link and that is perfectly fine.
12

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:51,000
It's going to be kind of weird though if I put
a link to something totally not related.
13

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:56,430
This is similar to the concept of conversion scent,
people just assume that the link is going to
14

15
00:00:56,430 --> 00:01:00,030
be something similar to the name
of the page that they're on.
15

16
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:04,300
So if you're building an account based on,
say, like, a business, OK, then that's great.
16

17
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,640
You just use your own home page, or more specifically,
17

18
00:01:09,660 --> 00:01:16,020
you can just slash and then send them to a landing
page or a specific page that's more relevant to what
18

19
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:18,310
people might be interested in if they're on their page.
19

20
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,230
Now, if you're not capable of linking directly to
your home page, then you have some options.
20

21
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:25,010
OK.
21

22
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:27,440
There are what are known as you URL shorteners.
22

23
00:01:27,450 --> 00:01:34,360
There's Bit.ly, there's Ow.ly, even Twitter
has their automatic URL shortener.
23

24
00:01:34,380 --> 00:01:39,660
Basically what that does is you take a URL that you
want to send whoever clicks the link to, and you
24

25
00:01:39,660 --> 00:01:47,240
give it to them, and they convert it into a chunk
of text basically that most people recognize.
25

26
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,650
Now, there's a drawback to doing this.
26

27
00:01:49,650 --> 00:01:54,330
And the only reason why you'd ever do this is if, say,
you wanted to, like, say we're Innovation Station, but
27

28
00:01:54,330 --> 00:01:58,310
I wanted to link them to like a Udemy page or something like that.
28

29
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:03,000
I think it might be a little weird if that was the link,
or maybe even the link name is just too long.
29

30
00:02:03,120 --> 00:02:08,140
So what I might do is I might use, say, like Bit.ly,
put in the link to that and then I'll get a Bit.ly
30

31
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:15,060
code, and I can even customize it so it's says Bit.ly / some
kind of text, we could put innovation station, and that, you
31

32
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:19,470
know, there's a little bit of a connection between
the name and the link if I do it that way.
32

33
00:02:19,470 --> 00:02:25,290
Now, that's not perfect though because a lot of people
associate Bit.ly with spam and all URL shorteners
33

34
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:30,300
with spam, because, well, if you were sending me
somewhere reputable, why would you have to hide the
34

35
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,560
URL, why would you have to use this cloaking link system?
35

36
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,810
So what we're going to do right now is do what's called
a pretty link, and this is actually a pretty cool technology.
36

37
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,250
So what we're going to do right now is do what's called
a pretty link, and this is actually a pretty cool technology.
37

38
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:44,730
I think this is probably the best thing you can do.
38

39
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:48,070
And if it is available to you, I think it's a fantastic option.
39

40
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:50,480
So what we're going to do is we're
going to do pretty links, and then
40

41
00:02:50,520 --> 00:02:54,690
I'm going to show you how to do custom short
links, and those are the two best options I know.
41

42
00:02:54,690 --> 00:03:00,270
So, the first one is called a pretty link, and a
pretty link is a technology, it's an app that you
42

43
00:03:00,270 --> 00:03:03,780
can install, and it works with most WordPress websites.
43

44
00:03:03,790 --> 00:03:05,550
And I feel fine promoting a WordPress app, because WordPress
is something like 27% of the internet. There are similar
44

45
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:10,650
And I feel fine promoting a WordPress app, because WordPress
is something like 27% of the internet. There are similar
45

46
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:16,460
apps for other platforms, if you use Shopify,
or Magento, or something like that.
46

47
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,970
And so what it does is it goes to your website, you
install it, and then when someone goes to your home
47

48
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:26,640
page, it will look at the traffic where it's coming from,
and then direct them somewhere else, so what
48

49
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,530
you can do is just put your home page,
no slash, anything, no Bit.ly slash anything,
49

50
00:03:31,770 --> 00:03:35,190
and you can have that system automatically direct
them to where you want to go, so you could send them
50

51
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:37,250
to a landing page that's unrelated,
51

52
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,730
and at the same time you can preserve using
the cool link that you have. Now, as a backup,
52

53
00:03:41,730 --> 00:03:47,400
we're going to cover how to make Bit.ly custom links,
and if you guys have ever seen what I do with my
53

54
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:52,910
links, it looks like evankimbrell.com, but it's evank.im
54

55
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:56,380
slash, so just visually it looks similar.
55

56
00:03:56,410 --> 00:04:01,050
OK, so let me show you how to do a pretty link. Let's say
that I was doing a personal account that was related
56

57
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,350
to Evan Kimbrell.
57

58
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:02,710
to Evan Kimbrell.
58

59
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:10,220
What I could do here, and I actually use WordPress,
thankfully, is I could just go ahead and go to
59

60
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:11,600
WordPress.org/plugins/pretty-link, and
it's a zip file that you just download.
60

61
00:04:11,670 --> 00:04:15,990
WordPress.org/plugins/pretty-link, and
it's a zip file that you just download.
61

62
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,190
Make sure that you have access to your administration panel, because that's where we're actually going to activate this.
62

63
00:04:20,190 --> 00:04:21,100
Make sure that you have access to your administration panel, because that's where we're actually going to activate this.
63

64
00:04:21,210 --> 00:04:27,220
After you download it, unzip it, so that it becomes a
big open folder, and you can read the ReadMe file if
64

65
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:29,830
you want to, it just talks a little bit more about how this works.
65

66
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:33,210
Then go into your administration panel for WordPress,
66

67
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:36,230
just go to Plugins here on the side, and go to Add New.
67

68
00:04:36,340 --> 00:04:40,590
Ok, then you want to do is, honestly, instead of
searching for the plugin, because it's actually not in
68

69
00:04:40,600 --> 00:04:46,580
WordPress' installed library, for whatever
reason, you go to Upload Plugin.
69

70
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,710
So you then go and click on the .zip file that you
downloaded, it only wants to open up in .zip, you open
70

71
00:04:53,710 --> 00:04:59,980
it yourself, or unpack it, and it just becomes a folder
with a mess of files, then it should say Plugin
71

72
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:04,570
Installed Successfully, if it doesn't, then you probably
have to troubleshoot it, and you want to hit Activate Plugin
72

73
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:05,350
Installed Successfully, if it doesn't, then you probably
have to troubleshoot it, and you want to hit Activate Plugin
73

74
00:05:05,350 --> 00:05:06,090
Ok, cool.
74

75
00:05:06,130 --> 00:05:12,760
So now what we can do is, were in the Plugins field,
we can go down and find our pretty links.
75

76
00:05:12,820 --> 00:05:13,090
OK.
76

77
00:05:13,090 --> 00:05:16,000
So it probably wants you to upgrade to Pro.
77

78
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:18,250
That gives you some more options.
78

79
00:05:18,250 --> 00:05:23,350
I'm not going to do it, just because I'm demonstrating how this works, but I'll show you how it works. Over here on the left side,
79

80
00:05:23,350 --> 00:05:24,850
I'm not going to do it, just because I'm demonstrating how this works, but I'll show you how it works. Over here on the left side,
80

81
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:27,630
it should have added the pretty links we set up,
81

82
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:33,760
and then what you have is an option to go to the home page,
right there, and then it shows you what links you've created.
82

83
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:34,830
and then what you have is an option to go to the home page,
right there, and then it shows you what links you've created.
83

84
00:05:34,930 --> 00:05:36,580
And then we just want to go to Add New Link.
84

85
00:05:36,580 --> 00:05:37,880
So you just copy in the URL.
85

86
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:39,890
In this case, mine is...
86

87
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:45,100
This is pretty long, it's just, let's say I wanted to link
to my Udemy user page, and then the pretty
87

88
00:05:45,100 --> 00:05:47,760
link, you just have to set something for this.
88

89
00:05:47,770 --> 00:05:51,300
So if it's Instagram, for instance, I just put insta.
89

90
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,990
Or you could just put whatever the
name of it is that you're sending it to.
90

91
00:05:56,990 --> 00:06:02,140
So if I'm sending to my idea generation thing, I can say
ideas, something like that, and then essentially what
91

92
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:07,140
it does is it creates that subpage, and then
directly pushes people to whatever this is.
92

93
00:06:07,330 --> 00:06:15,250
So, in this case, I could just say insta, and I'm pretty
sure if you have the Pro version, which, I'm not
93

94
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:17,380
going to buy it just for this demonstration,
94

95
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,560
but they'll allow you to drop this section,
95

96
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,220
so what you can do is just do your home page.
96

97
00:06:22,390 --> 00:06:24,790
You can also do this manually, but it's really complicated.
97

98
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:31,150
You'd have to probably be a developer or have a
developer do this, set up a script that essentially allows
98

99
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,660
traffic to come to your page, to figure out
where the traffic is coming from,
99

100
00:06:34,660 --> 00:06:38,870
and depending on where the traffic is coming from, just
send them somewhere else, it's kind of complicated.
100

101
00:06:38,870 --> 00:06:42,640
So this is probably your best option. So
I could do this, say insta, go to Create.
101

102
00:06:42,700 --> 00:06:42,940
OK.
102

103
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:47,440
And then I have this, and they give us some
basic link tracking information, which is great.
103

104
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:49,720
I can see who's clicking on it, where they're
coming from, if they're sharing it, things like that.
104

105
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:50,550
I can see who's clicking on it, where they're
coming from, if they're sharing it, things like that.
105

106
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,630
I can see who's clicking on it, where they're
coming from, if they're sharing it, things like that.
106

107
00:06:51,910 --> 00:06:53,640
So right now I have that link.
107

108
00:06:53,670 --> 00:06:55,080
Now what you can do is you can look at it.
108

109
00:06:55,090 --> 00:06:57,980
Let's say we just wanted to go to that link that we've created.
109

110
00:06:58,410 --> 00:06:59,400
We'll do that, and there you go.
110

111
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,380
We'll do that, and there you go.
111

112
00:07:00,520 --> 00:07:04,130
So it took me to the Udemy page
where it shows all my courses.
112

113
00:07:04,150 --> 00:07:04,530
Cool.
113

114
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:06,310
OK, so that's one option.
114

115
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:09,600
Like I said, if you upgrade to Pro, it's like $50 a year,
115

116
00:07:09,670 --> 00:07:15,040
you can do all sorts of other things, you can make it
so it's just your home page, I believe, and it gives
116

117
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:17,170
you a whole lot of other different options, so
117

118
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:21,670
you can do things like JavaScript redirects,
which, that's essentially how you do it.
118

119
00:07:21,670 --> 00:07:25,300
You go to the page and then it
immediately pushes you somewhere else.
119

120
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:30,490
This is something I think is pretty useful if you're
going to send them to, if you have a home page and
120

121
00:07:30,490 --> 00:07:33,550
you want that as your branding, but you want to send
them actually somewhere else, this also works if you're a
121

122
00:07:33,550 --> 00:07:36,110
personal brand and you have your name as your .com.
122

123
00:07:36,340 --> 00:07:36,620
OK.
123

124
00:07:36,620 --> 00:07:39,800
So the other option is to use a custom Bit.ly.
124

125
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:44,800
Now, if you don't know what I mean, it's kind of like
this. Generally, when you make a link with Bit.ly, it
125

126
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,770
just makes something that looks
like bit.ly / something crazy.
126

127
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:53,590
But if I wanted to create a custom one, see, I have it
set up that I can be a bit.ly I can be an evank.im.
127

128
00:07:53,590 --> 00:07:54,880
But if I wanted to create a custom one, see, I have it
set up that I can be a bit.ly I can be an evank.im.
128

129
00:07:54,940 --> 00:07:55,730
But if I wanted to create a custom one, see, I have it
set up that I can be a bit.ly I can be an evank.im.
129

130
00:07:55,750 --> 00:08:00,410
Now, that's just a visual trick so that if you looked
at that and you were reading something about me,
130

131
00:08:00,410 --> 00:08:05,840
and you saw my Udemy page, it would look very
similar to evankimbrell.com, it's the next best thing.
131

132
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:11,600
Also, it does have a bit of an advantage if you
post this other places, because it's shorter,
132

133
00:08:11,860 --> 00:08:17,830
you don't have, you don't take up as many characters,
which can be something that you want to conserve
133

134
00:08:17,830 --> 00:08:18,820
a lot of times in Instagram.
134

135
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:24,480
So let's say I wanted to go to, I don't
know, we'll just say udemy.com.
135

136
00:08:24,790 --> 00:08:29,860
I think I already have a Bit.ly link set up
for my username, so I can say Create,
136

137
00:08:30,020 --> 00:08:30,830
and there you go.
137

138
00:08:30,830 --> 00:08:34,350
OK, so now it says evank.im, and it
gives this number, and I could post that.
138

139
00:08:34,350 --> 00:08:39,350
Now, if I wanted to customize it, I could go down
here and just drop it down, and just put like a 2 or
139

140
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:44,240
something like that, something that just doesn't
look out of the ordinary, then I could copy that.
140

141
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:46,020
So if I went down...
141

142
00:08:46,120 --> 00:08:55,020
Hit Save. I could then take
that and go directly to Udemy.
142

143
00:08:55,320 --> 00:08:55,910
OK.
143

144
00:08:57,130 --> 00:09:02,700
So the way that you set this up is a little convoluted
and it takes a little bit of time, but I will
144

145
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:04,390
show you how you do it.
145

146
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,800
OK.
146

147
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:08,790
So first thing you need to do is figure
out what short domain you want.
147

148
00:09:08,790 --> 00:09:12,380
Now, it's kind of weird, like, where does .im come from?
148

149
00:09:12,460 --> 00:09:17,800
I'm not actually sure which one that is,
it's I think an island somewhere.
149

150
00:09:17,820 --> 00:09:22,530
You know, you can use like, .io, which is Indian Ocean.
150

151
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,780
You can use .er, which is Eritrea.
151

152
00:09:25,890 --> 00:09:28,530
Basically every country out there has their dot something.
152

153
00:09:28,530 --> 00:09:33,090
So it's just a matter of whether or not you can connect all of the available what we call top level domains to your website.
153

154
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,960
So it's just a matter of whether or not you can connect all of the available what we call top level domains to your website.
154

155
00:09:36,960 --> 00:09:42,590
So the easiest way to do this actually is just
to go to domainr.com and they do it for you.
155

156
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:46,950
So then what you would do is you would type
in the domain that you wanted to shorten.
156

157
00:09:46,950 --> 00:09:51,120
So let's just say I will do it for my account,
since I'm going to use that anyway.
157

158
00:09:51,180 --> 00:09:55,020
So let's say I had innovationstation.com.
158

159
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:59,160
And even if I didn't, I'd still use this,
because it looks like my account name.
159

160
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,780
OK, so then what it does is it goes all the way down and
it tries to figure out what you can do and then what's
160

161
00:10:03,780 --> 00:10:07,240
available, so if it says available, that's pretty much your best bet.
161

162
00:10:07,710 --> 00:10:12,310
All the way down here, you can even see like innovation.st,
162

163
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,700
you'd have to make an offer on that one.
163

164
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:23,330
Where is .st? So .st would be... let's see.
So .st is Sao Tome and Principe.
164

165
00:10:23,740 --> 00:10:27,200
The other options would be .at.
165

166
00:10:27,230 --> 00:10:28,960
I don't actually know what that one is, we can check.
166

167
00:10:28,970 --> 00:10:31,010
I believe it's Austria.
167

168
00:10:31,250 --> 00:10:36,720
OK, so .at domain is the internet country code for Austria.
168

169
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:37,940
Ok, cool.
169

170
00:10:37,940 --> 00:10:39,590
So what I could do is I could try to do this one.
170

171
00:10:39,590 --> 00:10:44,600
Now, keep in mind, when you buy a domain specifically
from another country, there's two things.
171

172
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:47,980
One, they're usually more expensive
than a normal domain, like a .com.
172

173
00:10:47,990 --> 00:10:52,640
It's not going to be $7 or whatever you get it from Go
Daddy, it's usually like $20-$30, sometimes it can be $50.
173

174
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:53,570
It's not going to be $7 or whatever you get it from Go
Daddy, it's usually like $20-$30, sometimes it can be $50.
174

175
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:56,280
And it also can take time.
175

176
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:05,160
So if you want, for instance, to get inno.va, that's
the Vatican, and I don't think the Vatican is
176

177
00:11:05,180 --> 00:11:08,810
super tech savvy, so it might take
some time before you get that one.
177

178
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,880
So let's say I wanted to do this one, which is
the best available option, so I might as well.
178

179
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:15,230
Now, you can buy it at iwantmyname,
you can buy it at GoDaddy.
179

180
00:11:15,230 --> 00:11:16,270
Now, you can buy it at iwantmyname,
you can buy it at GoDaddy.
180

181
00:11:16,280 --> 00:11:17,470
Now, you can buy it at iwantmyname,
you can buy it at GoDaddy.
181

182
00:11:17,510 --> 00:11:19,430
I usually use GoDaddy,
182

183
00:11:19,430 --> 00:11:21,880
so what I'm going to do is I'm going to select them.
183

184
00:11:22,010 --> 00:11:22,310
OK.
184

185
00:11:22,310 --> 00:11:26,800
So then what my option here is, it's about $18 per year.
185

186
00:11:26,960 --> 00:11:29,270
And I think that's fine.
186

187
00:11:29,270 --> 00:11:33,280
So I'm just going to go ahead and buy this,
and we'll just hyper lapse through this.
187

188
00:11:46,100 --> 00:11:52,280
OK, great, so I paid $12.59 for that domain. I thought
it was going to be more, I guess I got a discount.
188

189
00:11:52,280 --> 00:11:53,410
OK, great, so I paid $12.59 for that domain. I thought
it was going to be more, I guess I got a discount.
189

190
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:53,860
OK.
190

191
00:11:53,880 --> 00:11:56,310
Then what I can do is go back to manage my domains.
191

192
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,260
Now, if you guys use a registrar that's other
than the ones that are listed, that's fine.
192

193
00:12:00,470 --> 00:12:01,410
Now, if you guys use a registrar that's other
than the ones that are listed, that's fine.
193

194
00:12:01,410 --> 00:12:03,290
What you have to do is a redirect,
194

195
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:08,240
so you have to go and change the name servers from where
you buy it to point to the registrar that you prefer to use.
195

196
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:09,240
so you have to go and change the name servers from where
you buy it to point to the registrar that you prefer to use.
196

197
00:12:09,290 --> 00:12:11,540
Just another step and not everybody has to do it.
197

198
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,470
I personally suggest just not doing it, and just buying
it through one of the ones that are listed, because
198

199
00:12:15,470 --> 00:12:19,430
not every registrar can buy these
obscure, like, other country domains.
199

200
00:12:22,100 --> 00:12:26,530
OK, so then what you want to do is go down to find your
domain, and then we're going to go to domain settings.
200

201
00:12:26,530 --> 00:12:31,460
Now, what we have to do is we have to change the
settings in here and point it towards Bit.ly. In GoDaddy
201

202
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:35,860
then, after you get to domain settings, you're just going
to come down here and you go to manage DNS.
202

203
00:12:35,860 --> 00:12:37,030
Now, what's DNS?
203

204
00:12:37,030 --> 00:12:43,810
It's just, it's not really worth getting into, but it basically
tells the ICANN, which is the organization
204

205
00:12:43,810 --> 00:12:51,100
that controls all of the URLs, where to send this traffic, and it's... Whatever, it basically gives control of this to Bit.ly.
205

206
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:52,530
that controls all of the URLs, where to send this traffic, and it's... Whatever, it basically gives control of this to Bit.ly.
206

207
00:12:52,630 --> 00:12:58,270
So now what we want to do is we want to go down to our A records and we'll see that we have one and it just says Parked.
207

208
00:12:58,330 --> 00:12:58,940
So now what we want to do is we want to go down to our A records and we'll see that we have one and it just says Parked.
208

209
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:05,380
OK, so what we want to do is we want to edit this
and we want to send it to Bit.ly's IP addresses.
209

210
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:08,740
Now, if you just Google it on their website, they'll give it to you,
210

211
00:13:08,750 --> 00:13:16,180
but you can also just take it from us right here,
so I can say points to that address, hit Save,
211

212
00:13:16,510 --> 00:13:23,530
and then I can point one more, so now what I can do is
hit Add and go to Type A, and then do their second one.
212

213
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:25,640
And then for host, you just add
213

214
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:33,410
an @, that just makes it so that's the default,
the TTL is how long it takes for this to refresh,
214

215
00:13:33,430 --> 00:13:36,470
so it has to update its records publicly.
215

216
00:13:36,610 --> 00:13:42,580
Usually you just want to make this as soon as possible,
basically, so we can put this even lower than half an hour.
216

217
00:13:42,580 --> 00:13:42,960
Usually you just want to make this as soon as possible,
basically, so we can put this even lower than half an hour.
217

218
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:43,690
There is a limit though.
218

219
00:13:43,730 --> 00:13:48,420
I think you can't do it underneath, like,
five minutes or something.
219

220
00:13:49,230 --> 00:13:50,740
We could just do half hour, that's fine.
220

221
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:56,440
Then you'd just hit Save, it should unlock, if it
doesn't work, just hit Cancel and start over.
221

222
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:03,660
OK, so now I have two A records pointing towards the
domains that Bit.ly gives us, 67.199.248.12 and 13.
222

223
00:14:03,660 --> 00:14:06,510
OK, so now I have two A records pointing towards the
domains that Bit.ly gives us, 67.199.248.12 and 13.
223

224
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:11,460
Ok, then what you want to do is go to Bit.ly, and
I just created a new Bit.ly because if you're on the
224

225
00:14:11,460 --> 00:14:15,750
free version, you can only have one branded domain,
and I don't feel like upgrading to Enterprise.
225

226
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:16,380
free version, you can only have one branded domain,
and I don't feel like upgrading to Enterprise.
226

227
00:14:16,380 --> 00:14:22,630
So then we go over here to that hamburger menu,
then go to Settings - Advanced Settings.
227

228
00:14:22,820 --> 00:14:27,570
Branded short domain, and then it asks you, or tells you how
to set this up, and these are the instructions that it gave us.
228

229
00:14:27,570 --> 00:14:28,800
Branded short domain, and then it asks you, or tells you how
to set this up, and these are the instructions that it gave us.
229

230
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:31,110
We're not using a subdomain, so don't worry about CNAMES.
230

231
00:14:31,200 --> 00:14:33,560
And then over here you want to enter your branded domain.
231

232
00:14:33,570 --> 00:14:35,810
So it was innovationst.at,
232

233
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:36,920
So it was innovationst.at,
233

234
00:14:36,930 --> 00:14:42,810
that's the closest thing we could get. Then what we do
is we hit Verify Domain, and it depends on whether or
234

235
00:14:42,810 --> 00:14:45,060
not the records online have been updated.
235

236
00:14:45,060 --> 00:14:48,180
Sometimes it takes an hour, 30 minutes,
236

237
00:14:48,210 --> 00:14:51,390
sometimes it's instant, and sometimes it takes 24 hours.
237

238
00:14:51,390 --> 00:14:52,860
So we'll see. So then I hit yes,
and it says verification pending.
238

239
00:14:52,890 --> 00:14:55,130
So we'll see. So then I hit yes,
and it says verification pending.
239

240
00:14:55,260 --> 00:15:01,170
And we just have to come back to this when it's updated,
like I said, it could be 30 minutes, an hour, it
240

241
00:15:01,170 --> 00:15:03,870
could be a day. I will come back to you very shortly.
241

242
00:15:03,870 --> 00:15:04,410
All right, guys.
242

243
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:05,510
And we are back.
243

244
00:15:05,580 --> 00:15:11,730
As you can tell, I've aged severely since we last
saw each other, even changed shirts, I think.
244

245
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:21,660
OK, so it took actually about 24 hours for my branded
short domain to verify. So basically what it has to
245

246
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:27,870
do is when you add it to Bit.ly, it then goes and checks
with the server or the registrar that holds the domain
246

247
00:15:27,870 --> 00:15:31,500
information that you own it, and that the
settings are set up, and then it connects itself.
247

248
00:15:31,500 --> 00:15:32,670
information that you own it, and that the
settings are set up, and then it connects itself.
248

249
00:15:32,670 --> 00:15:38,730
So I just had a little bit of difficulty doing it, but the
way you check it, this is actually a little bit tricky,
249

250
00:15:38,730 --> 00:15:39,310
So I just had a little bit of difficulty doing it, but the
way you check it, this is actually a little bit tricky,
250

251
00:15:39,480 --> 00:15:46,470
if you go here and just go to settings, like we did before,
and then advanced settings, you'll actually find out there's
251

252
00:15:46,470 --> 00:15:49,280
no information about your branded short domains.
252

253
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:50,910
I don't know why.
253

254
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:55,330
What happens is you have to go over
here actually, to your account name.
254

255
00:15:55,350 --> 00:16:00,570
So if you click that, then it says Your Account, go to
Manage, and then up here in Branded Short Domains,
255

256
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:05,410
you'll see it right here, and it'll say Verified.
If it says Not Verified or Failed to Verify,
256

257
00:16:05,580 --> 00:16:10,870
you need to click it and then resubmit it, like,
restart the process and it'll ask you to retry it.
257

258
00:16:10,890 --> 00:16:14,440
I just went and checked my registrar
to make sure that I had to settings right.
258

259
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,710
It might just be because of GoDaddy it takes 24 hours,
259

260
00:16:16,710 --> 00:16:17,990
other ones might be faster.
260

261
00:16:18,030 --> 00:16:24,120
Now, if I want to actually use one of these domains,
which I will, and I'll throw it in my account later,
261

262
00:16:24,600 --> 00:16:26,700
I go to Create Bitlink, and right here,
262

263
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:31,860
OK, so it says innovationst.at, and I can go
back to Bit.ly if I want to, but otherwise I don't.
263

264
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:35,990
So then I would put my Udemy account.
264

265
00:16:36,330 --> 00:16:40,970
So I'd say... Ok.
265

266
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:45,840
And then it creates an innovationst.at link.
266

267
00:16:45,870 --> 00:16:53,360
and if I want to, I can customize this, so I could change
this to something that's not just gobbledygook,
267

268
00:16:53,370 --> 00:17:00,750
so I could just say innovationst.at and I can say something like course, or learn how, or something like that, we can say learnhow. Ok, and then I hit Save,
268

269
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:04,740
so I could just say innovationst.at and I can say something like course, or learn how, or something like that, we can say learnhow. Ok, and then I hit Save,
269

270
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:06,710
and we should be good.
270

271
00:17:06,830 --> 00:17:12,890
And then what I can do is I can paste this into
my Instagram account, and we should be good.
271

272
00:17:12,930 --> 00:17:18,060
OK, I'll do that and you'll see that change in the account
whenever we're browsing it later on, depending
272

273
00:17:18,060 --> 00:17:19,710
on which lectures are filmed first.
273

274
00:17:19,710 --> 00:17:21,460
But otherwise, that's how you do it.
274

275
00:17:21,480 --> 00:17:28,110
That's how you pick something that looks customized, and
if you run out of space, just customize the search shorter.
275

276
00:17:28,200 --> 00:17:29,780
Other than that, you guys should be good.
276

277
00:17:29,810 --> 00:17:30,420
See you next lecture.
