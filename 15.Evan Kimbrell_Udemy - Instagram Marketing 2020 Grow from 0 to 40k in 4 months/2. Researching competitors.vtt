00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:07.070
Hey guys, welcome back. Ready to spend some time going deep down the rabbit hole with this monster called Instagram?
1

2
00:00:07.450 --> 00:00:08.680
Well, OK.
2

3
00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:14.160
So what we're going to do in this lecture is we're going
to start making a list of all the accounts that are
3

4
00:00:14.220 --> 00:00:20.700
in our space and then we'll categorize them based on if they are directly competing with us, indirectly, or just adjacently.
4

5
00:00:21.060 --> 00:00:22.790
in our space and then we'll categorize them based on if they are directly competing with us, indirectly, or just adjacently.
5

6
00:00:22.830 --> 00:00:26.030
Here's what I mean by direct, indirect, and adjacent.
6

7
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.390
Let's say we have a shop that sells travelwear
for when people travel on airplanes.
7

8
00:00:30.390 --> 00:00:33.370
OK, like that hoodie that was on Kickstarter
8

9
00:00:33.380 --> 00:00:36.430
that made a lot of money because it
had all these travel features in it.
9

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:38.700
I think it was either that or on Indiegogo,
10

11
00:00:38.700 --> 00:00:40.610
but it was one of the biggest ones ever.
11

12
00:00:40.710 --> 00:00:45.270
Let's say that you were going to make a themed account, and the theme was going to be about weird things that happen on planes.
12

13
00:00:45.270 --> 00:00:46.380
Let's say that you were going to make a themed account, and the theme was going to be about weird things that happen on planes.
13

14
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.660
Now, believe me, there's plenty of
weird stuff that goes on on planes.
14

15
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:54.060
You've got emotional support peacocks,
pantless old people, drunks in the bathroom...
15

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.240
...whatever.
16

17
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.460
Plenty of material there. Now a directly competing account
would be one that's doing the exact same thing as you.
17

18
00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:03.810
Plenty of material there. Now a directly competing account
would be one that's doing the exact same thing as you.
18

19
00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:08.940
For example, there's an account called Passenger
Shaming, and they just show passengers being terrible
19

20
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.420
people, and they have over half a million followers just from that.
20

21
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:14.600
That's actually a direct competitor.
21

22
00:01:14.610 --> 00:01:15.960
Now, what would be an indirect?
22

23
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:22.110
Well, I generally consider an indirect an account that targets
the same people but delivers a different kind of content.
23

24
00:01:22.110 --> 00:01:23.040
Well, I generally consider an indirect an account that targets
the same people but delivers a different kind of content.
24

25
00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.360
So an account that just posts happy
passengers leaving in airports,
25

26
00:01:28.590 --> 00:01:33.030
that's roughly the same target audience,
but the material is completely different.
26

27
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:37.370
They're both targeting travelers, but
one's about what happens on planes,
27

28
00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:41.180
and the other one is just a theme
about people being happy going on trips.
28

29
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:45.990
One version is going for that mushy feely stuff, and
you were really more going for the gags and funnies.
29

30
00:01:46.020 --> 00:01:51.180
Or let's say that the account that we found actually
just shows off how nice first class compartments are.
30

31
00:01:51.180 --> 00:01:51.620
Or let's say that the account that we found actually
just shows off how nice first class compartments are.
31

32
00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.930
You know, that place that you briefly get to glance
at before being shuffled back to cattle class.
32

33
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:02.640
In that case, they're going for travelers again,
but their content is just different.
33

34
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.780
It's going for "we show you nice things,"
so it's a entirely different kind of vibe to it.
34

35
00:02:03.780 --> 00:02:08.400
It's going for "we show you nice things,"
so it's a entirely different kind of vibe to it.
35

36
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:14.190
Now, the last category is adjacent, and that just
means anyone in the travel or airplane travel space
36

37
00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:20.910
that doesn't fit into other categories. An account that rates,
let's say, airplane lounges would be considered adjacent.
37

38
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:21.990
that doesn't fit into other categories. An account that rates,
let's say, airplane lounges would be considered adjacent.
38

39
00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:27.300
They're taking first class customers and business
travelers most likely. An account that posts the cheapest
39

40
00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:29.290
flight fares every single day, I'd also consider adjacent.
40

41
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:30.790
flight fares every single day, I'd also consider adjacent.
41

42
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:33.600
They're clearly in the travel space.
42

43
00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:39.690
People who travel on planes probably would care,
but they're not targeting the exact same people who
43

44
00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:41.130
are doing the exact same thing.
44

45
00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:43.770
Honestly, do not get hung up about these names.
45

46
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:50.490
They're just really cheap and easy labels that I think are
useful, and honestly, I mean, you can go without them.
46

47
00:02:50.490 --> 00:02:50.690
They're just really cheap and easy labels that I think are
useful, and honestly, I mean, you can go without them.
47

48
00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:55.320
I just think it's useful to categorize them this way
because later on we're going to look at which ones
48

49
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.060
are complimentary to what we're doing, because it's
going to help us with promotion. It also helps to
49

50
00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:05.130
just sort it so that you can check in on your direct
competitors and see what they're posting, what's
50

51
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:08.160
working, and see if there's any type of content gaps.
51

52
00:03:08.160 --> 00:03:12.870
Now, what we want to do though is start digging around Instagram and the good old Google for accounts that are in that space.
52

53
00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:14.050
Now, what we want to do though is start digging around Instagram and the good old Google for accounts that are in that space.
53

54
00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.980
So, first things first, let's get a Google sheet
going where we can store our stuff.
54

55
00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:23.040
I'm just going to call this one "Instagram related
accounts", because I'm great at naming things.
55

56
00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:27.630
Then, in the section below, let's put our three categories,
and make sure that you obviously leave space
56

57
00:03:27.630 --> 00:03:29.330
for the accounts you are going to list out.
57

58
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:34.110
Also, I'm going to write out a more formal description
of the section so that when I go back to this
58

59
00:03:34.110 --> 00:03:40.170
later on, some night in a drunken haze, I can still remember
what I was talking about when I labeled everything like this.
59

60
00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:40.940
later on, some night in a drunken haze, I can still remember
what I was talking about when I labeled everything like this.
60

61
00:03:40.950 --> 00:03:41.380
Sweet, okay.
61

62
00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:42.230
Sweet, okay.
62

63
00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:48.360
In the columns ,we're going to put first followers, then
daily posts, then comments. Now, the first column
63

64
00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:49.440
is pretty easy. We're just going to put the total account
followers you see at the top of their profile.
64

65
00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:53.270
is pretty easy. We're just going to put the total account
followers you see at the top of their profile.
65

66
00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.750
That's helpful because then you can just see how big the account is at a glance, clearly they're doing something right.
66

67
00:03:56.750 --> 00:03:59.700
That's helpful because then you can just see how big the account is at a glance, clearly they're doing something right.
67

68
00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.920
Daily posts is the next column.
68

69
00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.590
What we're going to do is when we find an account, we're going
to go to their posts and then just look at the time stamp.
69

70
00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.060
What we're going to do is when we find an account, we're going
to go to their posts and then just look at the time stamp.
70

71
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:13.770
Now, if you go to a post, you just click on it, and it's
right below the image, you'll see when it was posted.
71

72
00:04:13.770 --> 00:04:19.470
Now, for that day, or, you know, depending on when
in the day you do this, we're going to look at the time
72

73
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.080
stamp below the photo and then see
how many there are for that day.
73

74
00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.500
We don't need to average it out,
74

75
00:04:24.510 --> 00:04:26.180
that's too time intensive.
75

76
00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.810
We just need to have a rough guess.
76

77
00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:32.140
Typically, an account that posts 10 times a day
is going to do that pretty consistently.
77

78
00:04:32.130 --> 00:04:37.650
So even if it's like an off day when they
posted seven, it's still posting a lot.
78

79
00:04:37.740 --> 00:04:43.710
If you want, you can just put total posts instead
for the column, because that's easier to collect,
79

80
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:46.950
but in reality it's just not as accurate.
80

81
00:04:46.950 --> 00:04:49.960
We don't really know how old the accounts are.
81

82
00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.160
So saying total posts doesn't really... You know, 100 posts over the last month is quite a bit different than over the last four years.
82

83
00:04:56.170 --> 00:04:57.520
So saying total posts doesn't really... You know, 100 posts over the last month is quite a bit different than over the last four years.
83

84
00:04:57.530 --> 00:05:00.780
Anyway, last column is comments, and this is optional.
84

85
00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:06.180
I just find it useful to put first thoughts here or things
you like about the accounts for quick reference later on.
85

86
00:05:06.180 --> 00:05:07.280
I just find it useful to put first thoughts here or things
you like about the accounts for quick reference later on.
86

87
00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:12.090
It's impossible really to remember all of the accounts,
so if you write "they're doing the exact same thing
87

88
00:05:12.090 --> 00:05:17.220
as I am" you'll know, hey, that's the guy that I have to
impersonate and eventually murder, and then take
88

89
00:05:17.220 --> 00:05:18.910
their place without anyone noticing,
89

90
00:05:19.020 --> 00:05:23.730
even their parents. We're talking about accounts.
Now that we have this set up, let's just jump into the
90

91
00:05:23.730 --> 00:05:27.800
app, and to think, Instagram, I was
actually feeling good about myself.
91

92
00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:32.430
Now, time to crush it by looking at other
people's curated vacations. In the app,
92

93
00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.460
we just have a very manual process to do this.
93

94
00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:39.870
First, we need to think of some keywords that people
might use to find our account, then we'll try those
94

95
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:45.990
in search and in hashtags. Once we find an account,
we'll copy it down in our sheet, and then press on the
95

96
00:05:45.990 --> 00:05:51.900
little button arrow where Instagram shows us the
suggested accounts that they think are in the same space.
96

97
00:05:51.900 --> 00:05:55.720
Now, it's not always right, but it's going
off of follower's preferences.
97

98
00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:59.160
Since Instagram gives us virtually no data ever,
98

99
00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:00.730
we kind of just have to trust them.
99

100
00:06:00.770 --> 00:06:06.900
OK, so I just go to the search section and then we just
want to see if we can find something in the travel
100

101
00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:10.150
space, and then use that as a jumping
off point to look at other stuff.
101

102
00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:13.250
OK, so I just go and click Search here,
102

103
00:06:13.270 --> 00:06:19.890
and then up at the top in Search I'm just going to search for probably just travel, I'm going to show you how this works.
103

104
00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:31.220
Travel... I wouldn't go to People, just so I'm not looking at random things I don't want to see. Elevator Travel, let's try that one.
104

105
00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:34.390
They have a quarter million followers.
105

106
00:06:34.480 --> 00:06:39.390
What you can see right here is there's a down
arrow right next to the follow, you click that, and
106

107
00:06:39.390 --> 00:06:41.950
then it gives you suggestions.
107

108
00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:49.570
So right here it's like a huge cache of potential travel accounts.
108

109
00:06:49.830 --> 00:06:52.910
And I could just have to figure out
whether or not these match what I'm doing.
109

110
00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:58.650
I mean, most of these are going to be adjacent, because
it looks like they're just showing destinations, which
110

111
00:06:58.650 --> 00:07:00.330
is just not what I'm doing.
111

112
00:07:00.570 --> 00:07:05.490
So I could do something closer to what I'm thinking of,
so you could do travelwear, or you can do airplanes.
112

113
00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:08.720
So I could do something closer to what I'm thinking of,
so you could do "travelwear," or you can do "airplanes."
113

114
00:07:08.790 --> 00:07:09.460
Right.
114

115
00:07:09.490 --> 00:07:14.070
So for travelwear, if I want to go in that direction, I'm
going to look for one that actually looks like it posts.
115

116
00:07:14.190 --> 00:07:16.120
So for travelwear, if I want to go in that direction, I'm
going to look for one that actually looks like it posts.
116

117
00:07:16.230 --> 00:07:22.380
So here is a company 3,000 travelwear, cool, then it's
going to show me individuals who are in this space,
117

118
00:07:22.470 --> 00:07:25.440
so I could probably spend time looking through that.
118

119
00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:29.240
OK, if I wanted to do what the actual thing was, which was
119

120
00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:35.130
airplanes, if I just type in "airplanes" probably, and see
if there's any themed accounts around this, and
120

121
00:07:35.130 --> 00:07:38.200
then I can borrow their suggested accounts.
121

122
00:07:38.370 --> 00:07:41.420
So let's see, Airplane Lovers, that's possible.
122

123
00:07:41.530 --> 00:07:46.730
Airplane Memes probably, wow, that has 500 followers.
123

124
00:07:46.740 --> 00:07:48.320
Airplane Lovers is a little bit larger.
124

125
00:07:48.360 --> 00:07:48.640
OK.
125

126
00:07:48.690 --> 00:07:54.570
And then it shows us ones that are even closer to this, it looks like
a lot of people are obsessed with specific types of airplanes.
126

127
00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:55.720
And then it shows us ones that are even closer to this, it looks like
a lot of people are obsessed with specific types of airplanes.
127

128
00:07:55.850 --> 00:08:00.740
It looks like it's going to point us to actual
companies that run airlines, you know, etc.
128

129
00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:05.880
Oddly enough, that Airplane Memes is probably the most
similar one, but you can use these as jumping off points,
129

130
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:09.360
and it's really easy to do, and then you
just have a list of ones to check out.
130

131
00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:14.160
All right, so that's how you do
it on Instagram itself, in the app.
131

132
00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.800
Easily the best way to do it, just search for keywords,
search for anything you think could be adjacent related,
132

133
00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.990
anything even similar, and then use that suggested feed
133

134
00:08:20.990 --> 00:08:23.670
anything even similar, and then use that suggested feed
134

135
00:08:23.670 --> 00:08:28.600
once you find something that is similar, and just kind
of fish through that. Unfortunately, Instagram is
135

136
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:34.680
not that great for research and pulling things together, so you
kind of have to do the same things over and over again.
136

137
00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:35.550

kind of have to do the same things over and over again.
137

138
00:08:35.550 --> 00:08:41.130
The other thing I'd suggest is just by Googling, honestly.
Google can find a lot of Instagram accounts as well.

139

140
00:08:42.030 --> 00:08:46.470
The way you would do it though is make sure that when
you do search on Google, you do this. You say site
140

141
00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.800
equals, and then you put instagram.com.
141

142
00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:50.550
OK.
142

143
00:08:50.550 --> 00:08:53.250
And that's going to limit all of your searches to Instagram.
143

144
00:08:53.250 --> 00:08:56.330
You can search for lists too.
144

145
00:08:56.640 --> 00:09:02.900
So a lot of times people publish
top 10 travel accounts on Instagram.
145

146
00:09:02.910 --> 00:09:12.200
So you could say "travel accounts on Instagram" and
you can probably find, see, well, there's actually tons.
146

147
00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:17.580
So "20 travel accounts to follow on Instagram" and then
you can kind of go through this and combine that with
147

148
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:20.830
the suggested feed if you want to.
148

149
00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:22.270
Let's see.
149

150
00:09:22.450 --> 00:09:23.030
OK.
150

151
00:09:23.170 --> 00:09:31.420
But if you search through using the site equals
trick, what happens is... So we could say
151

152
00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:40.480
"travel planes" or something, it
will only search on Instagram itself.
152

153
00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:49.420
So this is, here's the Passenger Shaming account that we talked about before, let's see, Travel Planes Colors, air travel...

00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.930

154

155
00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.480
So you kind of just have to pick
through this stuff, but it's relatively easy.
155

156
00:09:56.940 --> 00:09:59.010
Ok, guys, that's it for now.
156

157
00:09:59.020 --> 00:10:03.780
Put some work into putting together this list, that's going to help you a lot later on, especially when you get to promotion.
157

158
00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.340

158

159
00:10:05.590 --> 00:10:09.850
But it'll also help you just for understanding what
your competitors do, what the lay of the land looks
159

160
00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:13.420
like, and they're great for when you're
stuck and you don't know what to post.
160

161
00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:15.910
You can just go to them and see what's working for them.
161

162
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:16.540
OK.
162

163
00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:17.380
See you next lecture.
