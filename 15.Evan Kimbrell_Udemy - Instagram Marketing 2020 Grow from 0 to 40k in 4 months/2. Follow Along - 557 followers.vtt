00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:00.800
All right guys.

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:01.410
Welcome back.

3
00:00:01.440 --> 00:00:09.300
So this is the day eight I believe follow along and I apologize in advance for the asynchronous nature

4
00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:10.380
of some of these videos.

5
00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:17.850
It's kind of hard to start and grow an account and teach the lessons at the same time and then give

6
00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:23.700
you as much information and over my shoulder type insights as I can.

7
00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:28.550
So a lot of times I'm doing things that don't really fit into the category of a new concept.

8
00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.920
So I can't included in the lecture so I put them into this.

9
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:35.670
You just kind of have like a linear timeline of did this did this did this.

10
00:00:35.670 --> 00:00:40.280
Now in this timeline it's day eight and I just started doing page shout out.

11
00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:47.520
So if you remember paid shout outs this was the document that we just put together and we calculated

12
00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:51.630
out what the expected engagement per dollar was.

13
00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:59.490
Now what I'm going to do over the next couple days is I'm actually going to start using these and now

14
00:00:59.490 --> 00:01:05.790
the reason why I'm doing this is because we started posting our full five posts a day and this is the

15
00:01:05.790 --> 00:01:06.750
first day that we've done that.

16
00:01:06.750 --> 00:01:11.060
So we posted this okay these five.

17
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:13.020
That's what happened yesterday.

18
00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:16.740
And as you can see the engagement is pretty normal.

19
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:20.760
What we did get was something like 60 followers joined.

20
00:01:20.790 --> 00:01:23.080
Now this is really just like a snowball effect.

21
00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.210
If you're seeing this and wondering like how the hell is going to get to twenty thousand fifty thousand

22
00:01:27.210 --> 00:01:31.980
whatever it's just because of snowballing now I only have 500 followers so every time I post only shows

23
00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:36.570
it to them and so they can only interact so much which means that the engagement on the posts can only

24
00:01:36.570 --> 00:01:41.850
then go to so many top post hashtags and things like that.

25
00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:47.550
So at this point in the course I'm getting into page shout outs now because that's the only way that

26
00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:55.740
I can kind of skip this problem where in order to grow I need to do shout for shout and I can't really

27
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:59.700
get to that because I don't want to shout out with someone with 500 followers and nobody wants to do

28
00:01:59.700 --> 00:02:00.020
with.

29
00:02:00.060 --> 00:02:00.750
I don't have any.

30
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:05.670
So I'm going to use page shout outs to get to a point where I can then start trading with people so

31
00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:11.550
it's only gonna cost a little bit of money if somebody shouts for like 15 bucks 10 bucks I'm just gonna

32
00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:17.490
try them out record what works what doesn't and then hopefully when I get to a couple thousand then

33
00:02:17.490 --> 00:02:22.320
I can start reaching out and what I'll do is I'll start reaching out to people who have almost the same

34
00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:22.760
as I do.

35
00:02:22.770 --> 00:02:26.750
So they have two thousand I'll start looking for people two thousand and then I get to 5000 look for

36
00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.670
Google 5000 et cetera et cetera.

37
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.270
So that's kind of the next logical step for me.

38
00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.470
And that's what I'm going to do.

39
00:02:35.190 --> 00:02:41.010
But other than that yeah I mean we saw kind of what I expected each post usually gets me something like

40
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:49.260
10 followers I'm going to pick a strategy for my hash tagging whether it's rotating groups or going

41
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:56.400
after small hashtags that matched the average engagement on like posts or I don't know there's several

42
00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.270
other strategies.

43
00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.210
Some are just more time intensive but they're more targeted.

44
00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:02.190
So therefore maybe you want to try those.

45
00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:05.990
I'm not sure what I've been doing up till this point was just rotating.

46
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:12.060
So you to look at this quote for instance see OK.

47
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:13.350
These are the ones we have.

48
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:16.490
You can see it's an innovation entrepreneurship and business.

49
00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:16.790
OK.

50
00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:23.880
Then we look at the next one it was future technology design.

51
00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:27.210
So I'm just rotating Mario and I'm doing that because I'm hosting five times.

52
00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:30.330
I don't a person the same hashtag say like three times a day.

53
00:03:30.330 --> 00:03:33.040
That's just I don't know I don't know what the limit is.

54
00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.680
Honestly I don't really want to push it.

55
00:03:34.710 --> 00:03:36.180
I would say three's probably the limit.

56
00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.980
I think it probably fine a 2 to 3.

57
00:03:39.090 --> 00:03:43.460
I would try to keep it to two though and it also try to space out your post as much as possible.

58
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:51.300
Also I'm not optimizing my post timing yet because I don't actually have the data I need for that.

59
00:03:51.300 --> 00:03:54.510
So let's see my engagement here.

60
00:03:54.810 --> 00:04:00.720
As you can see these all the dots represent when I've posted so I don't actually know I need to fill

61
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:02.220
in more of these dots.

62
00:04:02.310 --> 00:04:04.860
And then what I'll start doing is lining them up.

63
00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:10.200
So like every there is a I will post at this time and this time this time the ones I've established

64
00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:13.870
before are when my people are awake.

65
00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.840
So that'll come in later so you'll start seeing posts being more effective and the hashtags being more

66
00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:19.470
effective.

67
00:04:19.650 --> 00:04:22.310
But it all kind of it's all a process.

68
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:28.300
We're gonna get data first let's check it let's check in with the content side of this.

69
00:04:28.340 --> 00:04:28.550
Okay.

70
00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:36.330
So what I've done is I've started two boards so still using innovation station posts but I'm also using

71
00:04:36.570 --> 00:04:38.570
one specifically for quotes.

72
00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.740
Now the process I'm using in quotes you'll actually see me talk about in the section or we talk about

73
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:52.650
automation but with the quotes what I'm doing is I'm using a just a virtual assistant type person to

74
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:58.680
go and find quotes on these lists call type websites compile them and then rewrite them slightly to

75
00:04:58.680 --> 00:05:03.940
make them a little more interesting and then the original virtual assistant is also just putting them

76
00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:07.200
into Canada and pumping them out.

77
00:05:07.270 --> 00:05:13.770
So once we have a big document of these I believe I have it just an award doc.

78
00:05:14.020 --> 00:05:17.390
Then we can just keep going with this.

79
00:05:17.420 --> 00:05:24.610
Also what I decided to do was so if the original pattern I had was so here my quotes.

80
00:05:24.610 --> 00:05:29.310
And if the person is famous then we put five facts about that person.

81
00:05:29.410 --> 00:05:32.230
But you kind of run out there.

82
00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:32.480
OK.

83
00:05:32.500 --> 00:05:35.740
So there are five facts but Einstein you kind of run out of this.

84
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:40.810
That kind of opportunity very quickly because there's only so many famous people with good quotes related

85
00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:42.920
innovation it's all too neat like came.

86
00:05:42.970 --> 00:05:44.020
John Cage.

87
00:05:44.020 --> 00:05:44.710
It's a great quote.

88
00:05:44.710 --> 00:05:45.420
Who is this guy.

89
00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:46.060
I don't even know.

90
00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:46.750
OK.

91
00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:53.050
So what we started doing instead was top three facts of the day about and then we just did some category

92
00:05:53.070 --> 00:05:54.600
and so these are just generics.

93
00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.710
So it would follow something like this.

94
00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:01.490
So be top three facts about Blank of the day so we could do anything we can.

95
00:06:01.510 --> 00:06:05.720
Innovation tech ideas business the future creativity.

96
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:09.940
There's tons and tons and tons of interesting facts and figures out there and so we have actually come

97
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:10.910
up with some of them.

98
00:06:10.990 --> 00:06:17.080
Anyway I made that switch just because it's a lot easier than what I can do is just put in generic facts

99
00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:18.450
the people aren't that famous.

100
00:06:18.460 --> 00:06:20.880
And then we can just rotate them and mix and match.

101
00:06:20.920 --> 00:06:26.290
So I don't ever have to actually keep adding to that list as long as it's long enough we can just keep

102
00:06:26.290 --> 00:06:31.220
rotating them unless somebody is literally memorize every single post we have.

103
00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.230
You know then that might be a problem.

104
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:39.340
Also I'm trying to do it such that when we post famous people multiple times like Steve Jobs we have

105
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:43.360
more than five facts because I'd be kind of annoying for just posting the same five facts over and over

106
00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:43.600
again.

107
00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.830
So we're trying to mix it up a little bit.

108
00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:45.430
OK.

109
00:06:45.460 --> 00:06:48.070
So that's pretty much where we're at.

110
00:06:48.070 --> 00:06:48.960
Next time I check in.

111
00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:51.310
We'll be seeing the effects of page shout outs.

112
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:55.420
You'll start seeing the hashtags getting a little more targeted.

113
00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.130
And yeah I think that's kind of the next step.

114
00:06:59.530 --> 00:07:00.870
So I'll see you guys then.
