00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:01.870
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.950 --> 00:00:07.220
OK so in this lecture we're going to do is something that I consider optional but helpful.

3
00:00:07.410 --> 00:00:12.990
So in the last years we talked about dividing up your workflow identifying the steps and the process

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:19.980
to create your content and then dividing them by specialty or just batching them by chunks of tasks

5
00:00:19.980 --> 00:00:24.820
that you think one person could dominate and do well kind of by themselves.

6
00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:32.220
Now now that we have that done hopefully theoretically what we should do is now take that list of functions

7
00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:35.900
or list of things they have to do and turn them into requirements.

8
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:41.220
Now if you've ever worked in say like web development you might have heard of things like web requirements.

9
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:41.510
Right.

10
00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:48.300
So if someone wanted to get a quote for a web site or two is going to build a website based on some

11
00:00:48.300 --> 00:00:51.080
specs you gave them they're going to use requirements.

12
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:54.780
Meaning what exactly do you require from that other person.

13
00:00:54.780 --> 00:01:00.250
It's a term you use a lot of times and contractor hire relationships.

14
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:02.720
I am giving them some type of requirement.

15
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:08.520
Now they know that these are the parameters of their job and they have to make sure that whatever their

16
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:16.350
output is conforms to these parameters without giving them requirements it just increases the likelihood

17
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:17.970
that they do something wrong.

18
00:01:18.060 --> 00:01:21.960
And also a lot of them will just have trouble starting because they don't know exactly what are the

19
00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:22.540
rules.

20
00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:26.670
It's one thing to say I need someone to write captions for my post.

21
00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:35.940
It's another thing to say I need someone to write 50 to 60 word captions four times a day that are broken

22
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:40.960
into one to two sittings chunks that are around technology.

23
00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:42.920
And here are the words you can't use.

24
00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:44.140
You kind of get the idea.

25
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:48.150
So we're going to do right now in our Luxor so I can kind of walk you through a little bit of how that

26
00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.080
process would work.

27
00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.690
Now let's go back to the video workflow that we had kind of established before.

28
00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:58.790
And I'm going to use this just because there's more pieces to the puzzle so to speak with an image it

29
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.320
was just like find the quote stick it in Kanva upload it or is this one it's more like find the interesting

30
00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.960
thing.

31
00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.310
Write a caption.

32
00:02:06.330 --> 00:02:12.340
Find some videos edit the videos then load loaded up schedule it and post it.

33
00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:15.540
So number one this whole first section here.

34
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:20.710
Remember I was going to do that so we don't actually have to do that but let's say for the caption writers

35
00:02:20.810 --> 00:02:21.260
OK.

36
00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:26.760
Now the easiest way to think of this as to first just start describing in detail what they have to do

37
00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:31.020
and then to finish up with the things that would be considered out of bounds.

38
00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:33.740
So for instance the dues would be.

39
00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:41.900
So research each innovation using no more than 3 sources.

40
00:02:41.970 --> 00:02:43.260
OK so that might be a rule.

41
00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:47.320
Now I might set that rule just because I don't want him to use 15 sources.

42
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:50.340
I want to make sure that they're not researching this like their Ph.D. thesis.

43
00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:53.490
I want to make sure they limit it to a certain amount of sources and this is actually a pretty useful

44
00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:57.900
requirement because a lot of people will not know when to stop.

45
00:02:57.930 --> 00:03:00.590
And so we don't have a time requirement.

46
00:03:00.780 --> 00:03:06.270
So this kind of gives them an alternative way of saying OK I've already gone too far.

47
00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:08.640
We're making sure that we get the gist of the story.

48
00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:13.200
We can write it effectively but we don't need every single detail because honestly they're writing like

49
00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.610
five sentences tops.

50
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:28.740
So then I might say pull out the most relevant pieces of information so I might say pull out four to

51
00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:36.870
six of the most relevant pieces of information for each innovation that may be a little redundant.

52
00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:44.610
Now this is just helping them understand that this process is going to work by picking four to six because

53
00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.640
the videos need to be under 60 seconds.

54
00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:52.510
So for captions pretty low six captains probably a little bit much.

55
00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.970
We're trying to shoot for that sweet zone of like maybe 30 to 45 seconds in the video and then I'll

56
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:10.780
say something like captions should be one to two sentences and be able to be understood in context.

57
00:04:10.830 --> 00:04:11.480
OK.

58
00:04:11.670 --> 00:04:17.940
So I understand that you know the captions that they're writing are essentially four to six one to two

59
00:04:17.940 --> 00:04:21.630
sentence Simmie captions for the video.

60
00:04:21.630 --> 00:04:27.780
And then I want them to write them in such a way that they can be understood without context so I don't

61
00:04:27.780 --> 00:04:28.830
want them to write.

62
00:04:29.010 --> 00:04:34.620
This thing is amazing because if someone started the video and spaced out for the first two captions

63
00:04:34.620 --> 00:04:35.670
and then looked at it it will go.

64
00:04:35.670 --> 00:04:37.070
This thing is amazing.

65
00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.130
That's not great.

66
00:04:39.210 --> 00:04:43.470
I know obviously in some situations you can't avoid this but they should generally put an effort towards

67
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:43.820
that.

68
00:04:43.860 --> 00:04:50.190
OK so then once they have say you know four to six of these one to two sentence chunks I want to say

69
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:59.880
something like make sure the 4 to 6 video captions tell the story.

70
00:05:00.900 --> 00:05:10.270
Simply from the what to the How To the when to the why is this interesting.

71
00:05:10.350 --> 00:05:10.890
OK.

72
00:05:10.980 --> 00:05:15.940
So those are just basic kind of instructions on how you should align them.

73
00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:16.200
Right.

74
00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.290
It shouldn't just be four to six interesting things about this.

75
00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:25.050
It needs to tell a story in a narrative format needs to make sense of I was watching this from scratch

76
00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:34.770
your head and the next thing I want them to do is upload a link to the innovation and their captions

77
00:05:35.220 --> 00:05:39.250
into Trello or whatever system it is that you're going to be using.

78
00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:48.000
The next thing I'll do is write D-don't section which will be things like don't describe the innovation

79
00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.400
as this or that.

80
00:05:51.660 --> 00:06:01.590
Please introduce the actual name of the product or team working on it.

81
00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:06.210
I think that's pretty important because otherwise you could just say some people have invented this

82
00:06:06.210 --> 00:06:08.400
new material that does this and this and this.

83
00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:15.090
Now I want to make sure that they say the researchers at University of Maryland came up with this new

84
00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:16.000
material.

85
00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:16.260
OK.

86
00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:22.050
And then and don't all say something like Don't write more right.

87
00:06:22.050 --> 00:06:27.670
More than six new captions and exceed say.

88
00:06:27.840 --> 00:06:29.070
I mean this is kind of arbitrary.

89
00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:32.340
This is something you might try out and then see if there's a problem with it or not.

90
00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:39.270
But I would say 80 words 80 words I believe is you know like seven or eight sentences maybe.

91
00:06:39.270 --> 00:06:41.090
Kind of depends on how long your sentences are.

92
00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:51.120
I'll say things like don't give opinions on the innovations or technologies we are covering.

93
00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:55.720
Now that's not necessarily something I care about but if for instance I didn't want people to do that

94
00:06:55.730 --> 00:07:00.690
that was my content strategy I just wanted to introduce it and let everyone else figure it out then

95
00:07:00.690 --> 00:07:01.180
great.

96
00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:03.420
OK so that's a pretty good example of don'ts.

97
00:07:03.420 --> 00:07:11.220
And here are some do's and the last thing you might say is include Waun call to action the end of your

98
00:07:11.220 --> 00:07:19.320
captions set that we'll ask the audience to answer a question and then I'll give them some examples

99
00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:25.870
like such as What do you think about blank.

100
00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:29.380
Is it a fad or the future.

101
00:07:29.510 --> 00:07:35.460
Or I might say or what would you personally use this for.

102
00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:40.760
Or do you think the price is worth it.

103
00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:41.290
OK.

104
00:07:41.310 --> 00:07:46.140
So I would try to spend a little bit more time going into this just to make sure I'm catching all of

105
00:07:46.140 --> 00:07:47.550
the outer bounds.

106
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:51.170
I try to make sure that I give them as much detail as possible.

107
00:07:51.270 --> 00:07:54.990
One thing you have to keep in mind is as you write this you might write things that you're not 100 percent

108
00:07:54.990 --> 00:07:57.630
sure about and it's up to you if you want to leave them out.

109
00:07:57.630 --> 00:08:02.460
I personally like to put in more instruction at the beginning and then slowly start to relax once I

110
00:08:02.460 --> 00:08:07.380
realize that hey some of these aren't actually that useful like giving opinions on innovations or technologies.

111
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:12.480
Maybe Actually it's pretty useful if someone says this technology doesn't really make any sense or we're

112
00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:17.280
not sure when this is going to launch but we're skeptical that actually might be kind of interesting

113
00:08:17.310 --> 00:08:20.080
but it's something that I can only make a decision about later on.

114
00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.900
Now you might still be ask yourself why are we doing this.

115
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:26.490
Well it's going to make sense why don't we get to the job postings because these are the parameters

116
00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:31.350
that we're going to give people that they have to follow and is just going to help us fill out our job

117
00:08:31.530 --> 00:08:36.810
for the most part when people see a job posting it helps if you give them the parameters or the requirements

118
00:08:36.810 --> 00:08:41.430
up front helps them have a better idea of how strict this is and whether or not it's something they

119
00:08:41.430 --> 00:08:42.960
can even pull off.

120
00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:50.370
And that will allow them to estimate their cost as well launch more accurately if someone looked at

121
00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:54.360
you know the job to write captions and it only have like one or two rules they might actually give you

122
00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.710
a lower price where there's lots of rules and might see that as kind of a pain.

123
00:08:57.810 --> 00:09:00.260
So they might get a higher rate.

124
00:09:00.290 --> 00:09:03.480
Now you might be thinking why wouldn't we just want someone who's the cheapest.

125
00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.970
Well because we're trying to do this for the long term.

126
00:09:05.970 --> 00:09:09.690
And if they pitch the wrong price and then find out hey it's got all these rules on it then they're

127
00:09:09.690 --> 00:09:11.370
not going to be a very happy camper.

128
00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:15.450
And that's going to cause problems and we don't want that we want people to work for the price that

129
00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.290
they're happy working for and what's worth it for them.

130
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.190
You can't always rely on them to know upfront what's worth it for them.

131
00:09:23.190 --> 00:09:26.890
So it's our job as a hierarchy to give them as much information as possible.

132
00:09:26.910 --> 00:09:30.120
All right guys so that's pretty much the way that I write requirements.

133
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:32.700
It's Pertti off the fly.

134
00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:37.110
I usually just divide them up in the do's and don'ts and then I combine the list and I'll put those

135
00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:40.080
into the job posting when we get to that section.

136
00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:40.850
All right CNN.
