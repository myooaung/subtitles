1
00:00:03,790 --> 00:00:06,930
OK so the next section over here is text.

2
00:00:07,030 --> 00:00:12,120
And in the tech section it's primarily where are you going to make 3D text.

3
00:00:12,270 --> 00:00:16,710
So where are you going make titles it's where you get to make things like lower thirds lower thirds.

4
00:00:16,810 --> 00:00:23,230
You're not familiar are these pieces of text and graphics that usually pop up in the bottom lower thirds

5
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:24,490
of your image.

6
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:30,160
Well if you've seen these before so let's say I wanted to put this on to here again I throw it on and

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:32,100
it's another elements are just thrown on the top.

8
00:00:32,310 --> 00:00:34,120
And let's say I'm over here.

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:41,590
So that pops up and says whatever you want to say so I can go here and click on this element and then

10
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:49,030
over here now that I'm I have the inspector window working on the text I can go over here to text and

11
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:51,140
now I can change it I can change the font.

12
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:58,720
I can change the alignment and even give me things like line spacing and tracking and kerning and things

13
00:00:58,720 --> 00:00:59,230
like that.

14
00:00:59,230 --> 00:01:05,440
So all that's pretty useful and a lot of these lower Thera's they give you right out of the gate are

15
00:01:05,440 --> 00:01:07,890
pretty useful if you're going to do my older courses.

16
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:14,500
You probably seen this one of use this one before that there's the title pull tab that added here but

17
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,600
honestly I don't even know why they added it or what use it's for.

18
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:25,870
If you want to add a just plain old text just any old text not something that has three-D or bumper

19
00:01:25,870 --> 00:01:27,730
or ripples or whatever.

20
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:32,100
All you have to do at least the search for me is you go down go up to all.

21
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,830
OK so now we're looking at all good at the search.

22
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:40,080
Now since we're in search we clicked all we're searching all of the tax effects and just type in custom.

23
00:01:40,120 --> 00:01:40,930
So that's really it.

24
00:01:40,930 --> 00:01:44,500
So custom is where you do whatever text you want.

25
00:01:44,500 --> 00:01:46,160
And it just gives you some text.

26
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,520
And now if I you know I can see this look at title and text and change all sorts of things about it.

27
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:54,250
You want to change the color of your tax you go down to face.

28
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:57,550
So you cook face it cooks show and then I can change it.

29
00:01:57,550 --> 00:01:58,380
Change the color.

30
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:03,620
I just click this little box right here and there's multiple ways of picking whatever color you want.

31
00:02:05,480 --> 00:02:07,190
Down here I have some saved ones.

32
00:02:07,190 --> 00:02:10,200
Here's where you put in the hex colors if you want to be exact.

33
00:02:10,370 --> 00:02:17,840
And it's pretty straightforward not you but a glow but an outline can do a whole lot of stuff a drop

34
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,060
shadow stuff.

35
00:02:20,170 --> 00:02:21,140
It works well.

36
00:02:21,170 --> 00:02:24,980
Keep in mind that if you add more and more of this stuff this stuff is really computer intensive so

37
00:02:24,980 --> 00:02:26,840
your computer might start getting really slow.

38
00:02:27,020 --> 00:02:27,960
So keep that in mind.

39
00:02:28,010 --> 00:02:29,940
Over here you can screw it the size.

40
00:02:30,010 --> 00:02:30,300
All right.

41
00:02:30,320 --> 00:02:31,660
We wanted to blow it up.

42
00:02:31,850 --> 00:02:38,150
Let's say we wanted to put it in the font that I always use in my courses we're using open sands for

43
00:02:38,150 --> 00:02:39,680
innovation station by the way.

44
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:45,460
But we can use proxy and Nova for just this example.

45
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:48,440
Extra Bold really bold.

46
00:02:48,500 --> 00:02:48,890
OK.

47
00:02:48,950 --> 00:02:50,540
All right moving on to the next part.

48
00:02:50,540 --> 00:02:52,860
These are called generators and generators are.

49
00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:54,340
I don't really explain them.

50
00:02:54,530 --> 00:02:56,770
They don't generate large objects.

51
00:02:56,780 --> 00:02:57,040
OK.

52
00:02:57,050 --> 00:02:59,610
So a lot of times your generators and the like backgrounds.

53
00:02:59,630 --> 00:03:03,410
So if I wanted to have a background you could just a text you need to fill it up with something in the

54
00:03:03,410 --> 00:03:04,150
back.

55
00:03:04,160 --> 00:03:09,650
I could do a background like that or now like pieces of paper or bubbles.

56
00:03:09,960 --> 00:03:10,460
Who knows.

57
00:03:10,490 --> 00:03:12,680
I mean they have a lot of different things here.

58
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:17,110
What's most useful personally that I found are solid solids.

59
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:18,330
They have custom.

60
00:03:18,350 --> 00:03:21,010
That means you can send whatever color you want.

61
00:03:21,230 --> 00:03:27,680
Or they things like grayscale pastel white vivid like pastels are pretty nice because it automatically

62
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:30,850
turns whatever color you use into pastel.

63
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,640
So if I were to take over now we're looking at pastels is that whatever I want I want.

64
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:37,110
All right.

65
00:03:38,050 --> 00:03:43,470
Never want to be really specific and go over to video change the shape Krop it distort it do all sorts

66
00:03:43,470 --> 00:03:46,430
of different things other than that you can add in things like textures.

67
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:53,160
So if I wanted to add a texture to something but I didn't want it to overwhelm whatever it is that I'm

68
00:03:53,190 --> 00:03:59,600
supposed to be looking at I'd click the element there and then go over to video up and then Specter

69
00:03:59,610 --> 00:04:04,610
go all the way down to positing that opacity to bring down the opacity.

70
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:06,030
So that was the original.

71
00:04:06,270 --> 00:04:09,840
And I did keep adding it until I kind of get the texture that I want.

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:11,340
You can only see it and they blow it up.

73
00:04:11,380 --> 00:04:15,670
OK then the last thing is this one which is the themes browser.

74
00:04:15,730 --> 00:04:19,860
That's just another little chunk of stuff that you can use.

75
00:04:19,860 --> 00:04:21,700
I honestly don't really know what the difference is.

76
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:26,850
A lot of times you'll find like lay out effects here you put them in boxes and shape it kind of like

77
00:04:26,850 --> 00:04:28,660
the layout app.

78
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:29,640
We have an Instagram.

79
00:04:29,640 --> 00:04:32,280
You've got things like Lynde's flares.

80
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:35,910
Honestly just spend some time and play around with it.

81
00:04:35,980 --> 00:04:41,700
Got the last two little bits I'm going to show you really quickly are the modifiers here for the preview

82
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,530
when do in the preview window.

83
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,870
This can be pretty helpful if you want to make this larger grab here and push this down.

84
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,510
Or alternatively you can push these to the side sometimes if you want to change.

85
00:04:54,540 --> 00:05:00,330
So you like this say will take the background the pastel right here and we wanted to change that element

86
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:00,710
right.

87
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:06,270
We could use different types transform cropping to store so if one were to transform this is free transforming

88
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:08,640
like Cliggott and then it gives me all of these things.

89
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:14,150
I can spin it if I want to I can shrink it and I can even go like this.

90
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:19,440
And notice how it's always symmetrical so this doesn't lose scale when you do this it just automatically

91
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:20,790
goes when you're done.

92
00:05:20,860 --> 00:05:22,010
Click that and you're done.

93
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:26,910
And here's where you can go full screen if you want to here's where you can change the view.

94
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:31,590
This is super helpful if you want it to fit to see exactly how it fits or sometimes you need to zoom

95
00:05:31,590 --> 00:05:36,550
out in order to move things that happens quite a bit or zoom out.

96
00:05:37,530 --> 00:05:38,540
Small it is OK.

97
00:05:38,550 --> 00:05:41,340
Other than that there are a couple of things you missed down here on the timeline.

98
00:05:41,340 --> 00:05:44,900
One thing worth understanding is that this right here is called the scrubber.

99
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:45,720
OK.

100
00:05:45,780 --> 00:05:51,090
And that is I don't really know explain that scrubbing is a common concept in a lot of different technologies

101
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,260
but where are the scrubber.

102
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,090
Is is what you're seeing right here.

103
00:05:54,090 --> 00:05:56,930
And if you want to go over to here you click on that news.

104
00:05:57,090 --> 00:05:59,200
So it just tells you what's here.

105
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,300
So you always know where you are otherwise you would be completely lost because all of their settings

106
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:04,080
right here.

107
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:05,550
So this is called Audio skimming.

108
00:06:05,550 --> 00:06:10,050
So if you have this on it's useful but sometimes it can be kind of annoying.

109
00:06:10,050 --> 00:06:15,900
So what happens is if you click it you can drag your mouse across and it automatically updates as I

110
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:18,350
don't have to click click click.

111
00:06:18,450 --> 00:06:23,340
And with audio it'll automatically scrub and start playing whatever it is that tiny little bit you were

112
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:24,220
over.

113
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,930
I don't ever use it because personally I think it's quite annoying but you can kind of seems like you

114
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:34,610
but it's super useful if you're trying to like find an error and audio and you're describing through

115
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:35,490
try to find it.

116
00:06:35,550 --> 00:06:41,600
Last thing right here is this is what will automatically make your elements match up.

117
00:06:41,610 --> 00:06:46,920
So if you didn't have an on I can actually move this just randomly in random locations that nothing

118
00:06:46,920 --> 00:06:48,850
is related to each other.

119
00:06:49,140 --> 00:06:56,040
And what happens oftentimes is you'll run into a situation where let's say you don't know you're trying

120
00:06:56,040 --> 00:06:59,820
to match things up or one thing shows and the next thing shows but you actually have a couple of pixels

121
00:06:59,820 --> 00:07:01,430
and in between and you didn't realize that.

122
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:07,050
So it actually looks like crap where you really want to do is click this so that whenever you have multiple

123
00:07:07,470 --> 00:07:13,620
elements on the screen it automatically clicks right to what's relevant and then it'll move on to the

124
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:14,520
next thing that's relevant.

125
00:07:14,550 --> 00:07:20,500
Which is one of these Aline's So it's constantly up and I'll stop right there like it zooms to fit that

126
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,720
it is really really helpful.

127
00:07:21,720 --> 00:07:26,940
The only time I ever turn it off is if for some reason I need to be more precise or the snapping is

128
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:29,370
actually screwing me up which happens quite often.

129
00:07:29,370 --> 00:07:31,370
OK so that's the basic UI of this.

130
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:34,930
You'll notice that I was using a rectangular canvas.

131
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:39,480
We wanted to make something for Instagram specifically you would want to go create your original project

132
00:07:39,810 --> 00:07:44,100
go down here and it says video properties go to custom and then if you go here all the way back down

133
00:07:44,100 --> 00:07:51,690
to custom custom and then type in 2010 A.D. Or you can type in the other specific ones that we had for

134
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:54,030
rectangles or portraits or whatever.

135
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:56,330
This is usually always the same twenty three point nine eight.

136
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,580
That's just what people are used to seeing in videos or at least like film.

137
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:03,330
So you click and key and now we have a square video.

138
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,160
All right so let's say you had a video that you wanted to finally save.

139
00:08:06,210 --> 00:08:11,700
Here's one that actually made for one of the lectures and then of course you could just go to it and

140
00:08:11,700 --> 00:08:18,060
then I hit command e and it pops up your master file plug pop up.

141
00:08:18,060 --> 00:08:21,900
And then what you do is you basically just set your settings and just pick what you want.

142
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:26,040
Generally you want your format to always be video and audio the only wanted your video or your audio

143
00:08:26,040 --> 00:08:29,690
you could isolate it right here other ways of doing it just like selling CDs and as the Apple devices

144
00:08:29,700 --> 00:08:30,980
but generally I just do this.

145
00:08:31,110 --> 00:08:32,760
I don't like to worry about all this other stuff.

146
00:08:32,850 --> 00:08:39,790
So the Yokota I often use H dot 2:06 for and that is just optimized for Web.

147
00:08:39,850 --> 00:08:46,120
Basically that's what YouTube uses it's probably the best ratio of quality to size you can get.

148
00:08:46,130 --> 00:08:48,640
You want something massive but also extremely crisp.

149
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,350
You can use these and explore those.

150
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:56,100
Then next you just sit next find a location where you want to save it save it and once it exports you

151
00:08:56,100 --> 00:08:56,680
are good.

152
00:08:56,740 --> 00:09:02,380
If you want to see the progress of the export go up to window and then background tasks will show you

153
00:09:02,380 --> 00:09:06,660
right there.

154
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:10,940
All right then once it's done it automatically pops up on your screen you can watch it to make sure

155
00:09:10,940 --> 00:09:13,670
that it comes out correctly and then move on.

156
00:09:13,670 --> 00:09:19,700
OK so now you know the basics of Final Cut Pro tan you could probably get in school around learn a lot

157
00:09:19,700 --> 00:09:25,610
more and potentially put something together in the next lecture if you want to you can watch me create

158
00:09:25,610 --> 00:09:31,730
a video using this for innovation station and it's going to be more of a looking over my shoulder following

159
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:33,790
along as I kind of hack it together to figure it out.

160
00:09:33,800 --> 00:09:35,020
All right with that being said I'm sorry.

161
00:09:35,030 --> 00:09:37,170
That was a long one but I'll see you in the next lecture.
