00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,880
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:02,410
OK.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:05,850
This is the section you've probably all been waiting for.

4
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:10,560
This is where we take the processes and the information that we've learned in the past lectures and

5
00:00:10,560 --> 00:00:17,870
sections and we work on isolating out the process we use to create our content.

6
00:00:18,270 --> 00:00:24,960
And then we start automating and so we'll do in this section is we'll start talking about process flows

7
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,860
and workflows that will the next lecture isolating out tasks that you do well and tasks that other people

8
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:32,400
do well.

9
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:39,270
Dividing them into assignable chunks then we'll start learning how to use Trello to make what's called

10
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,770
a Conboy onboard then we'll learn how to use later gram and optionally buffer if you want to to learn

11
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:54,120
how to prescheduled posts and then we'll get into writing requirements finding the right people to do

12
00:00:54,240 --> 00:01:00,690
each individual segment of our workflow and how exactly do we optimize and maintain that process.

13
00:01:00,690 --> 00:01:06,780
All right guys this is the section where I let you in on the behind the scenes how I'm doing a lot of

14
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:12,750
the content production how I set up the process and hopefully will give you a template for how you can

15
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:14,530
do it for virtually anything.

16
00:01:14,610 --> 00:01:14,820
All right.

17
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:16,150
With that being See you next lecture.
