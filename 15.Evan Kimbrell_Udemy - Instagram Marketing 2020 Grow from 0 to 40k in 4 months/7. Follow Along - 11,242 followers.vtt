00:00:00.180 --> 00:00:01.290
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:03.490
OK so it has been a while.

3
00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:04.270
I admit it.

4
00:00:04.290 --> 00:00:05.330
I apologize.

5
00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:11.300
But I'm finally back and ready to do an updates on where the Instagram account is.

6
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:16.590
Honestly it's been probably three weeks since the last one maybe a month.

7
00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:20.460
Now the reason why is just because I was traveling for a while now I'm back in the U.S. I'm in Austin

8
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:27.420
Texas and I just didn't really want to deal with it for a period of time which is something that you

9
00:00:27.420 --> 00:00:28.900
guys probably will want to do too.

10
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:32.640
You probably won't want to have to work on your own screen every single day.

11
00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:37.460
So I said I probably worked maybe 30 minutes a week on it maybe an hour a week.

12
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.580
Really just checking in on some things.

13
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:41.910
Replying to comments.

14
00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:48.980
Working with the software as I was using for finding people to follow and unfollow and it's kind of

15
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:51.990
just wanted to let it run and see where it would end up.

16
00:00:51.990 --> 00:01:00.850
So checking back in Rheticus or eleven thousand two hundred followers 362 posts.

17
00:01:01.200 --> 00:01:13.230
So 362 is close to the goal that I was shooting for something like maybe 300 or 400 videos and it did

18
00:01:13.220 --> 00:01:17.350
before videos plus one quote video.

19
00:01:17.430 --> 00:01:21.420
So I'm getting there and the idea is I'm going to make all this content and then just start recycling

20
00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:25.790
it from the beginning because at this point no one has seen what's happened.

21
00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:27.730
When part of posting in the first couple of days.

22
00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:32.490
So I can literally just start over from the beginning and go through it and you know if I see lower

23
00:01:32.490 --> 00:01:37.990
engagement rates and all I'll restart this engine up again but for the most part I not really.

24
00:01:38.010 --> 00:01:44.400
I've just been pretty picky about what I've been posting so right now I have nothing and captions the

25
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:49.890
whole bunch just kind of sitting and video people are working on them.

26
00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:52.350
They're kind of doing it at their own pace.

27
00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:55.450
It's not really a huge kind of a time crunch right now.

28
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:03.300
Kintz we have 77 that are essentially ready for being posted and we've posted two hundred and thirty.

29
00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:08.960
The RE might be slightly out of date but we still have plenty to go.

30
00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:14.310
Probably another month of posts and then once this is all done it's probably another five week six weeks

31
00:02:14.310 --> 00:02:17.070
like that so then we'll start recycling them and see how they go.

32
00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:23.550
Well that's going to do right now is I've actually started having one of the person who is kind of the

33
00:02:23.550 --> 00:02:29.520
project manager she's been looking at other people's accounts and finding interesting gadgets that performed

34
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.140
well.

35
00:02:30.180 --> 00:02:35.880
Now the idea is just because I started noticing this is that the posts that are the most gadgety seem

36
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:36.940
to do the best.

37
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:44.250
So if it's like here's a plane that can land on water.

38
00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:49.560
And this one look at the insides did decently well like I got seven followers just from a post.

39
00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:53.600
That's not bad considering you know post seven times a day six times a day.

40
00:02:53.610 --> 00:02:59.160
Now if you look at other ones that are a little too brainy or just maybe too I don't know science eat

41
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:01.910
specific things you can't really see that well.

42
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.890
You only got one follow from that one and you can see that the distribution has changed quite a bit.

43
00:03:07.980 --> 00:03:10.570
Now this is one thing you have to keep mine.

44
00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:12.810
Instagram changes all the time.

45
00:03:12.810 --> 00:03:14.670
They constantly change.

46
00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.500
So I decided to make this course during a period of time where they are changing nonstop.

47
00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:23.370
And so about a week ago they updated their algorithm so it's changed a lot.

48
00:03:23.460 --> 00:03:27.420
And you know everybody is writing their blogs about what's happened.

49
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.930
Basically they're kind of doing the same thing that Facebook did back when Facebook decided to kill

50
00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:37.800
Facebook pages not kill them or make them way less effective.

51
00:03:37.800 --> 00:03:42.690
So Instagram is basically trying to make it such that you only see your friends and family and they're

52
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:44.280
really starting to kind of focus on that.

53
00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:51.150
So it's getting harder for businesses to run but it's still everything seems to be fine it's just that

54
00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.610
I'm posting more for fewer followers.

55
00:03:53.610 --> 00:03:57.780
And so it's going to be kind of an adjustment period before everybody figures out what works and then

56
00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.710
more adapted and kind of change to notice some of my posts to see if I can find one like this one could

57
00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:08.260
just flopped for whatever reason just 10 post.

58
00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:13.020
And I don't know if that was just a technical glitch or what but I only noticed that with the new algorithm

59
00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:17.270
just occasionally like one out of five videos which is nothing good will come of it.

60
00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:23.460
So that's what I'm starting to do have something to focus on changing my source says he's using spring

61
00:04:23.460 --> 00:04:24.690
lines to find a lot of these.

62
00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:30.330
I'm looking at other people's accounts and seeing what's really gadgety and robot and matches the themes

63
00:04:30.330 --> 00:04:35.940
of what's worked before and then I'm kind of just taking those and then using the caption people to

64
00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:41.560
go and investigate those and then make them into our type of video.

65
00:04:41.610 --> 00:04:46.370
Yes that's kind of a slight change in content strategy.

66
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.860
See Other than that let's see how the growth has been since I last checked in.

67
00:04:52.890 --> 00:04:58.570
OK so over the last month it looks like we started at eighty five hundred.

68
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:09.850
And then law wornout at 11 to 42 so that means that screening probably on average something around like

69
00:05:10.330 --> 00:05:12.550
20 to 80 a day.

70
00:05:12.550 --> 00:05:19.360
So if you look at the table version here in Konno square you kind of see each day outworked 165 is a

71
00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:26.550
day I think I was working with another account to do a promotion 5:29 and 572.

72
00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:28.780
I did another promotion with one of those big accounts.

73
00:05:28.780 --> 00:05:35.800
I think it was finest inventions and just I just knowing that that's every time I use them it's like

74
00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.010
I think I paid them $150 and it got me a little over a thousand.

75
00:05:40.150 --> 00:05:41.810
So that's probably not a great deal.

76
00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.900
As you can see that's why I kind of discontinued it a little bit but so this week was fine.

77
00:05:45.910 --> 00:05:50.530
And then the next week you'll notice that we actually started to slow down.

78
00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:55.270
We actually had a day where we lost some and now this has actually to do with a bug in the software

79
00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:57.920
I was using for a follow on follow.

80
00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.920
Now one of the things I have spent a little bit of time over the last three weeks on is working on my

81
00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:04.270
zombie strategy.

82
00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:09.940
So I started using Jarvi And if you guys want to know more about that office look at the part of the

83
00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:16.390
course where we talk about Jarvi And it's when we start talking with the zombie strategy basically it's

84
00:06:16.390 --> 00:06:19.960
probably one of the more advanced software is out there.

85
00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.310
So the way that I use it because I'm using a Mac this is also the way I suggest you use it because you

86
00:06:24.310 --> 00:06:27.700
want it to be on a server and running 24/7.

87
00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:33.370
I can't put this on my laptop because I can't have this open on the Wi-Fi 24/7 I need to use it to move

88
00:06:33.370 --> 00:06:33.910
with it.

89
00:06:34.090 --> 00:06:40.420
So I have it on a server and I think I only pay at first I was paying like eight dollars a month or

90
00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:41.940
something for the server.

91
00:06:42.310 --> 00:06:44.920
And now I'm probably paying like $20.

92
00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.770
I didn't really even need to pay $20.

93
00:06:46.770 --> 00:06:52.140
I just was getting frustrated how slow it was when I was trying to click through things.

94
00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:57.140
So these are the social profiles that we've started building out.

95
00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:01.230
They are all pretty simple for the most part.

96
00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:07.120
As you can see phone invalidations is another thing and them updated and now it's happening is I have

97
00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:09.770
to do phone validation with these kind of repeatedly.

98
00:07:09.790 --> 00:07:12.450
So we're trying to figure out what exactly is causing this.

99
00:07:12.580 --> 00:07:18.940
But as you can see we have all of these kind of around science gadget themes like oh my innovation newest

100
00:07:18.940 --> 00:07:23.950
attack Oh my technology all the way down to futuristic ideas futuristic tech ideas.

101
00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:25.300
Robots are here.

102
00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:25.980
Things like that.

103
00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:29.880
OK so we can look at one of the newer accounts we've made.

104
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:34.570
So if it's this phone validation actually won't show up until you validate it again which I've been

105
00:07:34.570 --> 00:07:37.710
using burner as my phone number to do that.

106
00:07:37.840 --> 00:07:40.860
So it's a crazy ass track.

107
00:07:41.290 --> 00:07:44.620
OK so that was crazy tech because I have 96 followers.

108
00:07:44.620 --> 00:07:50.860
I think this account was only like maybe 4 days old something like that and they've all been using the

109
00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:54.530
same settings for following and for posting.

110
00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:58.540
Now part of the problem is that what they've been doing is they've only been posting as you can see

111
00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:02.240
posts from the main account innovation stations.

112
00:08:02.260 --> 00:08:08.290
The idea was just that we would just broadcast the same posts and then added more hash tags to them

113
00:08:08.650 --> 00:08:11.120
so that we'd get more coverage.

114
00:08:11.470 --> 00:08:16.810
But what's happening is that it just makes it a little too obvious for Instagram to notice that this

115
00:08:16.810 --> 00:08:21.670
is probably related to the main account and that's why they've been doing these phone validation checks

116
00:08:21.970 --> 00:08:23.200
and it's just been kind of annoying.

117
00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:24.880
So it's no big deal.

118
00:08:24.880 --> 00:08:28.610
What will will eventually figure it out I just don't get a lot of time into it.

119
00:08:29.050 --> 00:08:34.420
But you can see that some of the older ones are still doing pretty well despite the fact that they keep

120
00:08:34.420 --> 00:08:39.260
turning on and off on and off on and off like newest and tech has 6800 followers.

121
00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:39.640
Oh my God.

122
00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:44.620
Technology 7800 this one nine you know 900.

123
00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:45.910
This one has 4000.

124
00:08:45.910 --> 00:08:51.770
But remember that was the one that started at 3000 So it's really only about a thousand real ones.

125
00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:55.290
So yeah these are all doing fine.

126
00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:57.500
Just some bumps in the road obviously.

127
00:08:57.520 --> 00:09:04.060
What I think we'll have a little start doing is making it such that these accounts post intermittently

128
00:09:04.060 --> 00:09:09.520
from the main account and then grab posts from other people's accounts that are in the same theme but

129
00:09:09.520 --> 00:09:12.490
also are performing well or are popular.

130
00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:18.280
So let's look for tech for tomorrow and you see they'll have a follow box going to the settings I've

131
00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.140
been using for following weight between a hundred twenty nine hundred eighty seconds.

132
00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:26.410
It's kind of standard for me followed between four and eight people for operation with the delay between

133
00:09:26.410 --> 00:09:27.830
30 and 60.

134
00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:35.050
Now you have them skipping non-English users users of only going for people with profile images only

135
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:37.240
people who are posted in the last 90 days.

136
00:09:37.240 --> 00:09:43.000
These are kind of basic things you just want to make sure that they're not dead accounts or zombie accounts

137
00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.230
themselves.

138
00:09:44.230 --> 00:09:51.790
So what I had was follow limits and the idea was I think I had them starting off something insanely

139
00:09:51.790 --> 00:09:57.670
small like a hundred a day 120 a day and then ramping up until it reaches a certain amount.

140
00:09:57.670 --> 00:09:59.280
So this one's slightly off.

141
00:09:59.320 --> 00:10:03.220
I should just say follow 150 to 200.

142
00:10:03.220 --> 00:10:07.810
Now the reason why is because you have to warm these up like when you first start them you cannot just

143
00:10:07.870 --> 00:10:13.660
immediately start following people and liking people you really have to look like an actual user and

144
00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:16.100
actually it would not be that crazy about it.

145
00:10:16.120 --> 00:10:21.880
They also sleep around the same time I could randomize these roles if I wanted to and that might be

146
00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:25.980
one way of making sickroom stop checking in on them constantly.

147
00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.660
But for the most part this does seem to work while it's working.

148
00:10:31.810 --> 00:10:34.320
See I've been doing.

149
00:10:34.390 --> 00:10:37.530
Obviously each one has the unfollow bot running.

150
00:10:37.690 --> 00:10:40.310
That's relatively simple.

151
00:10:40.330 --> 00:10:43.300
Just make sure that they all involve more than they follow.

152
00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:47.830
So at the end of the day I don't have these accounts that are falling thousands and thousands of people.

153
00:10:47.830 --> 00:10:51.580
Of course this isn't terribly important for the zombie accounts.

154
00:10:51.580 --> 00:10:54.730
I mean it makes them look a little less legitimate for someone who might follow them.

155
00:10:54.730 --> 00:10:59.410
But again that's not their main point their main point is to drive traffic to my main account.

156
00:10:59.710 --> 00:11:05.710
One that I have them liking comments just because that's something I generally likes they like to see

157
00:11:05.710 --> 00:11:12.280
accounts that are engaged with their followers and then the post settings I just have them set up so

158
00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.440
it says reposte from that username and it's almost always innovation station because that's where it's

159
00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:18.750
reposing from.

160
00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:24.570
And I set my sources to innovations to Asia now sort of do is adding some of these ones like final tech

161
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:26.070
and futurism gadgets.

162
00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:34.050
And then if you look at the repots settings I set them to only grab the popular ones.

163
00:11:34.090 --> 00:11:39.640
So I'm not just constantly grabbing their whatever their latest post is and just reposting it I'm checking

164
00:11:39.640 --> 00:11:44.110
to make sure that you know has a certain level of something on it.

165
00:11:44.190 --> 00:11:51.550
What I'll probably end up doing is posting these settings once I settle on a stable build for the zombie

166
00:11:51.550 --> 00:11:57.930
accounts so that you guys can just copy it not have to go through this trial and error effort.

167
00:11:57.970 --> 00:12:03.190
It is really just a lot of tinkering honestly and even once I post whatever works for me it's only a

168
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:07.140
matter of me six months later it'll be different it'll still work.

169
00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:10.170
But to optimize it you still have to tweak more and more.

170
00:12:10.480 --> 00:12:14.380
OK so other than that not a whole lot going on with the zombies.

171
00:12:14.380 --> 00:12:18.880
I've been running those I need to start doing some test to see how effective they are to see if they

172
00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:24.010
are in fact actually driving traffic to me but that's something I'll do once I figure out a way to get

173
00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:25.720
these phone validation stopping.

174
00:12:25.720 --> 00:12:31.060
Now one thing that Jarvi just recently launched was something called the like exchange and what this

175
00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:35.610
is is essentially like an engagement party you ever heard of those or have ever mentioned them.

176
00:12:35.740 --> 00:12:41.770
It's where they just take over your account and at a certain period of time during the day they make

177
00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:45.320
you like a bunch of posts from people who are in the exchange.

178
00:12:45.340 --> 00:12:49.300
And then what essentially happens is I can have my zombies like a bunch of posts from other people in

179
00:12:49.300 --> 00:12:54.450
the system and then build up credit and then use that credit to push likes towards my main account.

180
00:12:54.460 --> 00:12:58.390
Now there's obviously better ways of doing this it could have a mix or so on my zombie's benefit and

181
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:04.090
some are giving to the system but I figured this is the simplest way of kind of funneling engagement

182
00:13:04.090 --> 00:13:09.040
into innovation station and for the most part integrate and Instagram likes the engagement that comes

183
00:13:09.040 --> 00:13:11.620
from us because they are real accounts.

184
00:13:11.710 --> 00:13:17.080
And also because Cervi has control over the entire system they can constantly tweak it to make sure

185
00:13:17.170 --> 00:13:24.370
it looks valid and they obviously spent a lot of time setting this up so that it's always random and

186
00:13:24.370 --> 00:13:29.130
it's always changing and it never looks like some organized system.

187
00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:35.530
So one of the reasons why this hasn't worked out obviously great is just because well the scheme these

188
00:13:35.800 --> 00:13:39.800
ones just keep getting these phone validations what happens is I use burner.

189
00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:49.180
And then all the validate them and then what ends up happening is maybe four or five days later it does

190
00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:50.760
it again or maybe a week later.

191
00:13:50.770 --> 00:13:58.840
So what might end up happening I think is I will switch to aged accounts and just rebuild them so they

192
00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:00.900
don't have to deal with this new age accounts.

193
00:14:00.910 --> 00:14:08.680
Basically their accounts are made a long time ago and they're pre phone verified and day you know because

194
00:14:08.680 --> 00:14:09.470
they're older.

195
00:14:09.490 --> 00:14:15.670
Instagram just assumes they give it a little more leeway with what you can do because they assume that

196
00:14:15.670 --> 00:14:18.060
it's more likely to be real.

197
00:14:18.070 --> 00:14:23.180
I haven't yet decided on a purchase purchaser like where I get to get them from there's account boxers

198
00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:24.690
insta PVP.

199
00:14:24.730 --> 00:14:25.950
I mean there's a bunch of them.

200
00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:32.440
I'm just going to kind of figure out who's got the best rates and who for instance will help me revalidate

201
00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:36.190
them in in the off chance that this doesn't work and I have to invalidate them anyway.

202
00:14:36.760 --> 00:14:41.500
But that's what I'm exploring over the next I don't know a week or so and once I get those.

203
00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:43.280
And then the zombies will kind of stabilize.

204
00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:47.500
Now there's a couple other strategies I've yet to implement now.

205
00:14:47.530 --> 00:14:48.840
Shout for shouts.

206
00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.690
I did end up doing a show for show with someone.

207
00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.240
Let's see if I can find the message with them.

208
00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:59.210
This is going to end up happening was I attend thousand followers and this person had 10000 followers.

209
00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:07.000
And so you know we did a shout for a show and it didn't really work that well.

210
00:15:07.120 --> 00:15:12.440
The reason why is just because it's 10000 followers like a shout from a $10000 account even if you have

211
00:15:12.440 --> 00:15:16.250
a really high engagement isn't going to give them a mountain.

212
00:15:16.450 --> 00:15:22.030
Considering that I again on any given day 20 to 100 followers you know this maybe got me an extra 50

213
00:15:22.030 --> 00:15:28.480
so it's not going to really kind of move the needle so I'm kind of moving the goalposts down farther

214
00:15:28.780 --> 00:15:32.640
with Shelfer shouts I'm stressed from talking with bigger accounts.

215
00:15:32.650 --> 00:15:34.370
There's always there's been talking about how.

216
00:15:34.390 --> 00:15:41.260
No I usually do it around like 40 or 50 or even 100 so I'm going I'm going to play by ear and see how

217
00:15:41.260 --> 00:15:42.150
that goes.

218
00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:47.110
I think what is funny is a lot of people have actually started to reach out and ask to pay me to do

219
00:15:47.110 --> 00:15:48.270
shouts business really.

220
00:15:48.280 --> 00:15:51.070
How much for a promo.

221
00:15:51.130 --> 00:15:56.500
Let's see this person are developing a free live translator and they would like to see if they can publish

222
00:15:56.500 --> 00:15:58.280
something about us.

223
00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:04.850
This person want to show it how this person I was just telling me something funny I guess.

224
00:16:05.170 --> 00:16:07.990
Here's another one just curious what your shout out rates are.

225
00:16:07.990 --> 00:16:11.530
So as you can see you know it's that's the way I wanted to monetize this account.

226
00:16:11.530 --> 00:16:15.580
That's clearly an opportunity it's going to get better as the account gets larger.

227
00:16:15.580 --> 00:16:20.120
I think also people like the way that we present the products we're covering so it makes them look good.

228
00:16:20.170 --> 00:16:26.140
But anyway the person that did it with their account was tech formation.

229
00:16:26.140 --> 00:16:28.600
I thought their stuff their posting was fine.

230
00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:33.070
Like I actually kind of liked it and I thought it really fit with my site with what I was doing.

231
00:16:33.070 --> 00:16:40.030
One problem though is just from looking at their account I didn't realize that they just didn't kind

232
00:16:40.030 --> 00:16:45.340
of had the same demographics so their audience is primarily in India which is fine.

233
00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:50.140
It's just that they're awake at a different time than my audience so if I'm posting during their time

234
00:16:50.350 --> 00:16:56.440
then my audience isn't really awake and I really want to make sure that I focus all of my followers

235
00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.310
in one time zone.

236
00:16:57.310 --> 00:16:59.050
So anyway did that.

237
00:16:59.050 --> 00:17:00.130
I'm going to wait on that a little bit.

238
00:17:00.130 --> 00:17:03.990
I still have yet to do live giveaways.

239
00:17:04.300 --> 00:17:06.190
I still get to do videos.

240
00:17:06.190 --> 00:17:09.730
I haven't done story highlights yet that's another thing I could be doing.

241
00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:16.210
I still have the story engine going pretty much every day it's at cild in a same thing top innovations

242
00:17:16.210 --> 00:17:16.980
of the day.

243
00:17:17.070 --> 00:17:23.110
And we go through it and you know for the most part every day maybe three or 400 people watch it all

244
00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:24.050
which is good.

245
00:17:24.070 --> 00:17:27.000
You know it usually brings them back now that we passed 10000.

246
00:17:27.010 --> 00:17:28.220
Also this is nice.

247
00:17:28.220 --> 00:17:32.480
Now you can swipe up and it will bring them to my account.

248
00:17:32.590 --> 00:17:36.940
Obviously it's my account but I have to swipe up for more auction which is great.

249
00:17:37.150 --> 00:17:37.540
OK.

250
00:17:37.540 --> 00:17:42.040
And then obviously here when I look at my tags This is hardly an indication of how many zombies I have

251
00:17:42.040 --> 00:17:47.800
running and this is sometimes when I know if there need to be phone belet because I just don't see as

252
00:17:47.840 --> 00:17:49.380
many happening.

253
00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:53.830
So all right growth has been pretty consistent.

254
00:17:53.830 --> 00:17:59.620
I mean it's nothing super fast or surprising but at the same time I haven't touched this account in

255
00:17:59.620 --> 00:18:01.030
several weeks.

256
00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.860
So that's generally a good thing.

257
00:18:02.860 --> 00:18:07.620
You know if I don't touch it it's going to grow at maybe three to four thousand a month.

258
00:18:07.900 --> 00:18:10.210
If you want to be more aggressive You obviously got to spend more time.

259
00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:15.460
So in this next week I'm going to work on getting these zombies running better and starting to work

260
00:18:15.460 --> 00:18:23.560
on giveaways and live video and changing the source of some of the videos that I use ones that are already

261
00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:24.770
pre validated.

262
00:18:24.790 --> 00:18:25.730
Do well.

263
00:18:25.750 --> 00:18:29.890
So anyway so that's what it's going to be.

264
00:18:29.950 --> 00:18:31.310
And I'll check in.

265
00:18:31.330 --> 00:18:33.880
I don't know when the next time I make a video probably in.

266
00:18:33.910 --> 00:18:35.890
I'd say another week.

267
00:18:35.890 --> 00:18:36.600
All right guys.

268
00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:37.270
CNN.
