Hey guys, welcome back.

00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:08,400
OK, so in this section, we are going to talk about the options available to you if you want to monetize your Instagram account.

00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,510
OK, so in this section, we are going to talk about the options available to you if you want to monetize your Instagram account.

4
00:00:09,510 --> 00:00:15,510
Now, not everybody out there is making an Instagram
account that is directly tied to a business, but if you
4

5
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:22,410
are, we're going to talk about ways that you can convert
this interest and this traffic into something that
5

6
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:24,160
you can make money off of,
6

7
00:00:24,540 --> 00:00:30,240
and if you don't have a business attached to it, we'll explore a couple ways that you can make money off the account itself.

8
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:31,390
and if you don't have a business attached to it, we'll explore a couple ways that you can make money off the account itself.
8

9
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:36,560
So we'll cover things like how to
monetize just traffic on your account,
9

10
00:00:36,570 --> 00:00:42,750
we'll talk about how to capture emails most effectively
and plug them into some email marketing system,
10

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:44,970
whatever you actually have set up for your business, we'll
11

12
00:00:45,050 --> 00:00:47,020
also talk about flipping accounts,
12

13
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,420
and then the last thing we'll talk about
is how to sell directly on the account.
13

14
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,270
This works especially well if you're in retail.
14

15
00:00:53,270 --> 00:00:53,520
All right.
15

16
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:55,590
With that being said, let's jump right in.
16

17
00:00:55,590 --> 00:00:58,560
This is kind of a short section, but see you at the end.
