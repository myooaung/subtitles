Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,800 --> 00:00:06,150
OK so in this section we're going to talk about competitions.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:12,210
Now competitions are pretty simple it's when you give away something usually something that doesn't

4
00:00:12,210 --> 00:00:17,550
cost you a lot of money or it's something that cost you a lot of money and in return you get increased

5
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:23,070
engagement follows tags chairs whatever it is that you want.

6
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:25,740
You can tailor a competition for that.

7
00:00:25,740 --> 00:00:31,320
So this lecture that's what we're going to do want to talk about the types of competitions out there

8
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,930
like giveaways and sweepstakes and as I said a very large variety of them.

9
00:00:37,020 --> 00:00:42,480
We're talking about the best practice so you don't do them incorrectly and get in trouble and we're

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:48,570
going to try our best to figure out what the monetary value of pulling one of these off is now this

11
00:00:48,570 --> 00:00:52,890
is one of these sections where you can sit back and relax and just watch if you want to watch me screw

12
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:55,880
around and blow some money and see how it works.

13
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,450
That's perfectly fine with me.

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:03,570
So if you have a budget and it's something that you actually could justify for your business Well I

15
00:01:03,570 --> 00:01:05,280
think this is the section for you.

16
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:05,880
See you next lecture.
