00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,730
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,770 --> 00:00:07,300
OK so let's round out what we were finishing in the last lecture by finishing the job post that we're

3
00:00:07,300 --> 00:00:12,510
going to use for up work to find a video editor for our project.

4
00:00:12,510 --> 00:00:15,470
Now remember I'm just filling this out as if I were hiring a video editor.

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:22,200
But the same rules and systems are going to apply to essentially whatever you hire whether it's a writer

6
00:00:22,290 --> 00:00:27,830
and editor or a clip finder someone who actually goes out and shoots their own footage.

7
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:29,630
It's all going to kind of fall the same pattern.

8
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,520
You always fill it out with the what and the why and the how and the when and then you end with this

9
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,590
mysterious section called the extras.

10
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:42,820
The extras are where I like to put anything I couldn't fit somewhere else.

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:43,180
Right.

12
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,700
Anything you can think of that might be relevant like how you're going to communicate.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:52,440
We're going to communicate through slack or what project management tools you might use anything you

14
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:57,970
can think that might be relevant I might tell them that there's a keyway process they have to go through

15
00:00:57,970 --> 00:01:01,580
it might describe how they're going to communicate with me directly.

16
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:07,520
I might even give them a specific ask to put into their cover letter when they apply.

17
00:01:07,620 --> 00:01:11,710
Now the main thing I put in extras though is what we call a trial.

18
00:01:11,730 --> 00:01:17,340
Now when you're hiring people and keep in mind I have entire courses on outsourcing so if you guys want

19
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:22,590
to learn how to do this in a much more in-depth way or at least understand the background behind it

20
00:01:23,190 --> 00:01:25,680
or a more comprehensive understanding of it then check those out.

21
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,630
But for now we're just going to kind of scratched the surface such that you can be proficient at posting

22
00:01:30,630 --> 00:01:36,000
a job post but one of the things I found that is the most effective thing with hiring contractors is

23
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:37,710
doing a trial or trials.

24
00:01:37,710 --> 00:01:38,460
Pretty simple.

25
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:44,010
You take whatever it is that are supposed to be doing and take one very small task of it and then ask

26
00:01:44,010 --> 00:01:45,870
them to do it before you hire them.

27
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:49,500
Now there's obviously going to be a balance between what you ask them to do and what they're going to

28
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:53,220
be expected to do for their entire job.

29
00:01:53,220 --> 00:02:00,360
So if if you're trying to make them make videos I would try to look for some tasks that I think will

30
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,760
only take let's say 30 minutes 30 to 45 minutes something like that.

31
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:08,070
I think you could do half of video in that.

32
00:02:08,070 --> 00:02:15,420
So what I might ask them do is do a half video do collect videos for three mini captions that are usually

33
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,760
like four to six and assemble them together in this type of format.

34
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:23,780
And that's what I might ask them to do beforehand.

35
00:02:23,820 --> 00:02:27,480
The thing with contractors is just that it's almost impossible to know whether or not they're going

36
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,270
to return something you like.

37
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,240
It's impossible to know at the very beginning whether or not they're just saying everything they think

38
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:34,490
you want to hear.

39
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:38,710
Or if they even have even the slightest understanding of what you're asking them to do.

40
00:02:38,730 --> 00:02:44,370
So the best way to just get through that muck is to ask them to show that they can do it.

41
00:02:44,370 --> 00:02:49,650
Now depending on the industry and what you're hiring for this is less common and sometimes more common

42
00:02:49,650 --> 00:02:51,260
with writers it's very common.

43
00:02:51,270 --> 00:02:55,920
They actually sometimes will just offer up a sample to begin with with video editors.

44
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,810
It's probably a little less common just because their work is more time intensive.

45
00:03:00,810 --> 00:03:04,590
So in order to show you something of worth it could take them a lot of time.

46
00:03:04,590 --> 00:03:07,470
Do they want to invest all this time if they're not going to get the job.

47
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,160
Typically the way I get around this is by offering paid trials.

48
00:03:11,160 --> 00:03:15,600
So if it's one of those cases where let's say you're getting feedback to people saying they don't want

49
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,830
to do a trial it's going to take too much time.

50
00:03:17,910 --> 00:03:19,950
Then you can say we can do paid trials.

51
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:23,150
And the way you would do that is essentially hire them all the same.

52
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:28,890
But you would set limits on their contract such that they can only work for a certain amount of time

53
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:30,920
and then that way they automatically get paid for it.

54
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:33,570
If you don't like it you can just in the contract there.

55
00:03:33,570 --> 00:03:37,170
Now if you don't want to pay for the trial I mean you could certainly try to get them to do it for FREE.

56
00:03:37,170 --> 00:03:42,300
Just keep in mind that's going to lower the number of people who respond to you or actually complete

57
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:43,290
the trial.

58
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:48,060
If they're doing a really big project in it a lot of people applying that I might say just do this trial

59
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,160
and it's not paid.

60
00:03:49,270 --> 00:03:51,840
And I would get enough people to choose from.

61
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:55,430
But just keep in mind sometimes it's not always the case.

62
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,390
So in this case what I probably would have done is in this trial I would give them a very basic description

63
00:04:00,390 --> 00:04:04,590
I mean even put this in a separate doc like a Google sheet or an Evernote doc and in that duck I would

64
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:07,030
say here's some video clips or.

65
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,010
Here are the actual captions for a video.

66
00:04:11,070 --> 00:04:14,590
Here's the link to the stories you understand the context of it.

67
00:04:14,760 --> 00:04:20,400
Please assemble these three captions together with matching media according to the parameters of the

68
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,430
job post and then send them to me and tell me when you're done.

69
00:04:23,460 --> 00:04:27,990
It might actually take a little more management time from you but once they do this it's pretty much

70
00:04:28,020 --> 00:04:32,180
impossible to hire someone who doesn't know what they're doing.

71
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:32,390
Right.

72
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:35,390
Because you have removed a lot of the uncertainty.

73
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,840
So anyway make sure you're using this as some kind of a mechanism just to see whether or not they can

74
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:41,700
follow instructions and deliver what they can.

75
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,680
You can even minimize this as much as possible.

76
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:48,410
I've even done trials where the trials just to answer a question and the message that they send to you

77
00:04:48,410 --> 00:04:49,430
and they apply.

78
00:04:49,500 --> 00:04:52,470
You'd be amazed at how many people don't read the entire job post.

79
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:59,720
And I just use that as a least a very weak filtration system for who I'd then go and actually look through

80
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:04,290
you want to spend your entire time looking through every single person applying because the simpler

81
00:05:04,290 --> 00:05:08,280
the task is the more these contractors start to blur together.

82
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:15,060
OK so let's go back to our job right here and we'll just go ahead and paste in the post here.

83
00:05:15,060 --> 00:05:18,120
Now if I were doing this for real I would have filled this out.

84
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,440
You know some of the sections aren't completely done and I would remove what why why how when.

85
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,120
But you kind of get the point.

86
00:05:24,120 --> 00:05:27,720
So I put that in there if I had additional project files I might put them in here and this is a great

87
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:33,330
place if for instance I described a trial here I could put the video clips here or the captions here

88
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,100
that they're supposed to use in the trial.

89
00:05:35,100 --> 00:05:40,890
Sometimes if I'm running a project and I don't have anything live to show them I might upload some video

90
00:05:40,890 --> 00:05:46,370
files that I made that do match my standard and that's something that would be extremely effective here.

91
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,780
A lot of people will ask for that like hey have you made a video before.

92
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:50,860
At this point I have.

93
00:05:50,860 --> 00:05:52,380
So I could very easily upload that.

94
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:53,430
Then what is it next.

95
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:57,180
OK then it says what type of project do you have one time project ongoing project.

96
00:05:57,180 --> 00:06:01,530
I'm not sure to you what you want a one time project means that you know there's a deadline already

97
00:06:01,770 --> 00:06:04,930
ongoing means it could end in the future you just don't know when.

98
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:06,380
And this is obviously I'm not sure.

99
00:06:06,390 --> 00:06:11,040
So I typically say like ongoing project solely for this cause I don't know when I'm going to start content

100
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,170
production now.

101
00:06:12,180 --> 00:06:15,710
Now we have our screening questions and these I think are extremely important.

102
00:06:15,710 --> 00:06:20,460
What I usually put are just questions to make sure they are the right fit.

103
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:27,250
So if for instance I am requiring everyone to work in Adobe Premiere I might ask them a question what

104
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:28,980
video editing software do you use.

105
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,080
If they respond with Sony Vegas then clearly they didn't read the post or they're just not a good fit.

106
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,170
You can also just do things like ask them questions based on the job posts.

107
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:42,530
You can ask them generic things like how long have you worked on video editing.

108
00:06:42,570 --> 00:06:48,840
I've done things like please link me to a video that is the most similar to the videos I was referencing

109
00:06:48,840 --> 00:06:53,520
and the outpost one thing the video editors specifically is that they have a portfolio and they'll just

110
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,420
dump that on you.

111
00:06:54,420 --> 00:06:59,100
And a lot of times it's 60 70 videos and you have no idea which ones are relevant.

112
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:05,490
I'd much prefer they pick one or two that shows directly that they can do the skills that I need them

113
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:07,530
to do and then show me that.

114
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:10,130
So you can select from suggested are recent.

115
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:15,570
Those are usually not very good or create your own questions so I might typos in there so I might say

116
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:23,550
link to a video you've made in the last two years I might put a time requirement on it just because

117
00:07:23,940 --> 00:07:29,310
if they made this 10 years ago that means most likely it's just going to look out of date ten years

118
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:33,420
ago what was popular was not popular now so I want to make sure that these are active skills they're

119
00:07:33,420 --> 00:07:34,460
using.

120
00:07:34,920 --> 00:07:39,540
That matches the criteria of the video.

121
00:07:39,730 --> 00:07:41,330
Yes.

122
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:47,010
That might be a little wordy but you kind of get the point now that I've added that I could add more

123
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:48,480
if I wanted to.

124
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:51,130
Usually I add to.

125
00:07:51,470 --> 00:07:55,710
If it's a really simple task just one if it's a really big task where I'm going to be really picky about

126
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:57,930
who I hire I'll do maybe three.

127
00:07:57,930 --> 00:08:03,690
And then let's see sometimes also even to ask them questions like What do you think of this video and

128
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,230
link them to a video and just see the reactions because sometimes I like to make sure that the person

129
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:09,560
actually has thoughts about it because that's very useful.

130
00:08:09,720 --> 00:08:09,960
OK.

131
00:08:09,960 --> 00:08:13,890
And the last thing is do you want them or have a cover letter now a cover letter is kind of a double

132
00:08:13,890 --> 00:08:14,700
edged sword.

133
00:08:14,700 --> 00:08:20,070
No that means is when they apply they're going to have to write something to you why they're interested

134
00:08:20,070 --> 00:08:24,570
in the job what they've done in the past that's relevant it's just like when you apply to a job you

135
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:28,040
have a cover letter specifically addresses while you're applying this.

136
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:33,330
Now for me it's great because I want them to articulate why they care I don't want someone who is just

137
00:08:33,600 --> 00:08:37,500
applying en masse to jobs didn't even know what they are applying to.

138
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:40,690
And then it soon became an issue as soon as I try to actually hire them.

139
00:08:40,710 --> 00:08:44,930
But at the same time you might run into an issue where a lot of people will just give you templated

140
00:08:44,950 --> 00:08:47,640
stuff a lot of times people just use the same cover letter.

141
00:08:47,640 --> 00:08:52,110
Maybe they modify a couple of words in it and it's not particularly useful because what they're going

142
00:08:52,110 --> 00:08:56,150
to do is just quote their portfolio which you could have seen anyway just by clicking on their profile.

143
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:00,130
So anyway I usually ask for a cover letter just because you know if they send me a template and one

144
00:09:00,140 --> 00:09:03,300
I don't like it I can just use that as a filtering criteria.

145
00:09:03,390 --> 00:09:05,030
And if they do actually send me one that's great.

146
00:09:05,030 --> 00:09:09,210
I'm not expecting them to write some you know a thousand word essay I just need to make sure that they've

147
00:09:09,210 --> 00:09:12,750
actually thought about it and know what they're applying to next.

148
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,670
Now what skills and expertise are most important to you.

149
00:09:14,670 --> 00:09:20,820
Now typically what I do here is I'll pick a broad category specific category ones.

150
00:09:20,830 --> 00:09:26,050
OK so if I'm hiring video editors I'll get something really broad like video editing.

151
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:26,820
OK.

152
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:31,530
Now the reason I picked is because now it's going to show up to anyone who is listed as video editing

153
00:09:31,770 --> 00:09:32,490
but then pass that.

154
00:09:32,490 --> 00:09:33,720
Now I want to get specific.

155
00:09:33,720 --> 00:09:33,960
Right.

156
00:09:33,960 --> 00:09:39,410
Like if I'm only using Adobe Premiere than I want Adobe Premiere specifically.

157
00:09:39,420 --> 00:09:42,060
Now if you're into video editing you might not necessarily be in it.

158
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:45,690
There'll be premiere and even pass that I might ask for something that's really specific.

159
00:09:45,690 --> 00:09:47,920
Like will say kinetic type Barfy.

160
00:09:47,940 --> 00:09:48,110
Right.

161
00:09:48,120 --> 00:09:52,430
That's a type of editing technique where they just have a lot of text that moves around a lot.

162
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:55,100
Very common in say like explainer videos.

163
00:09:55,110 --> 00:10:01,570
OK so these are not absolutely required but I'm just saying that broadly you're into video editing.

164
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,480
Check this out and then pass that it's going to help you in Premiere.

165
00:10:04,540 --> 00:10:09,160
And if you have skills in this all the better you can also do more generic things up here like motion

166
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:15,910
graphics or animation or even just video post editing or videography but those typically fall into this

167
00:10:15,910 --> 00:10:16,330
category.

168
00:10:16,330 --> 00:10:20,170
Don't ask me what the DNC video post editing and video editing is.

169
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:21,630
I'm not even entirely sure.

170
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:25,030
Anyway just trying to make sure you pick at least two of these.

171
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:27,060
Don't try to go over five.

172
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:30,310
I think they actually stop at around 6 so it doesn't really add any value.

173
00:10:30,310 --> 00:10:32,650
If anything it looks like your job is too restrictive.

174
00:10:32,650 --> 00:10:36,420
So if you're people will apply than it next then it's up to you.

175
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:38,130
You want USA only or worldwide.

176
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:41,540
I don't really care what region they're in.

177
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:44,740
You know if you're working on a project that was really important that you worked in the same exact

178
00:10:44,740 --> 00:10:48,890
time and communicated and in order to make the product well everyone had to be in sync.

179
00:10:48,910 --> 00:10:51,910
Then maybe you want to pick someone who's in the same time zone but for the most part I don't really

180
00:10:51,910 --> 00:10:52,440
care.

181
00:10:52,450 --> 00:10:56,470
This will get me more applications other than that you can set location preferences and I generally

182
00:10:56,470 --> 00:11:01,020
find this pointless just because if I say worldwide but I prefer United States it doesn't make a difference.

183
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:06,400
No one's gonna see that and go oh they're open to world wide but I'm in Canada but they want United

184
00:11:06,400 --> 00:11:06,730
States.

185
00:11:06,730 --> 00:11:07,610
I'm not going to apply.

186
00:11:07,630 --> 00:11:09,180
It's usually just ignored.

187
00:11:09,220 --> 00:11:10,860
Ok you have visibility.

188
00:11:10,990 --> 00:11:11,520
Anyone.

189
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:16,000
Only up or freelancers invite only invite only only works if you are literally going to spend their

190
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:20,230
time and go and find every single person that you want to apply to your job.

191
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:21,430
That's a waste of time.

192
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:25,420
This is also generally a waste of time unless for some reason what you're doing is sensitive and you

193
00:11:25,420 --> 00:11:29,960
don't want to have all this information is out in the wild and indexable.

194
00:11:30,010 --> 00:11:32,130
Keep in mind once you hire someone this is going to disappear.

195
00:11:32,140 --> 00:11:36,370
So it's not going to be on google anymore but this does help with other people who are searching for

196
00:11:36,370 --> 00:11:36,990
jobs.

197
00:11:37,090 --> 00:11:39,470
So this will get you a little bit of a boost.

198
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:45,440
Again I only use this if I have something some kind of IP or confidentiality that I want to keep.

199
00:11:45,490 --> 00:11:48,790
Then out here I can put how many freelancers do you need one or many.

200
00:11:48,790 --> 00:11:55,210
Generally my strategy here is if I'm not sure if I want more or multiple click this OK and then I'll

201
00:11:55,210 --> 00:12:00,190
put like 2 and the reason why is because if they put two or three people are more likely to apply.

202
00:12:00,220 --> 00:12:05,320
I just say one and they come in they're like oh crap he's already got 30 applications that's just going

203
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,150
to act as a deterrent to people applying.

204
00:12:07,150 --> 00:12:09,670
So I usually just say like two or three.

205
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:13,270
OK now here qualifications.

206
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:19,130
This would be kind of like where we were setting skills that we actually think are important.

207
00:12:19,150 --> 00:12:23,170
But now this is just something that they can check on more thing to make sure they have the right skills.

208
00:12:23,170 --> 00:12:26,670
I don't find this useful because people don't really actually read it so I just it.

209
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,830
Next the next thing is pay by the hour pay by a fixed price.

210
00:12:29,830 --> 00:12:31,240
Now you guys are outsourcing courses.

211
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,760
You've probably seen me go over this section in over ten minutes just talking about the differences

212
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:37,730
between the two.

213
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:40,170
In this case we're really just doing hourly.

214
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:44,020
You could do fixed price and all you'd have to do is say it's a fixed price per video but the expense

215
00:12:44,020 --> 00:12:47,310
is kind of frustrating because I don't know what the price of video at.

216
00:12:47,410 --> 00:12:51,310
If you guys have a hard budget then that might actually be a good strategy if you only pay 20 bucks

217
00:12:51,310 --> 00:12:55,810
of video then do that and say 20 bucks because people look at it I can do it for 20 bucks will not apply.

218
00:12:55,930 --> 00:12:57,020
Saves you a lot of time.

219
00:12:57,100 --> 00:13:01,780
For me I'm just doing hourly a lot of times what I do is do hourly and then as I figure out how long

220
00:13:01,780 --> 00:13:06,850
it takes each person that I might switch it to a fixed price just so I can then contain my cost and

221
00:13:06,850 --> 00:13:07,690
predict them.

222
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:09,310
But for the most part I was sick this way.

223
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:14,470
Now here you are going to decide what do you need do you want extremely great video editing where you

224
00:13:14,470 --> 00:13:16,370
don't need to explain a lot to them.

225
00:13:16,420 --> 00:13:21,490
Or are you OK with managing them more giving a more instruction and having them kind of learn on the

226
00:13:21,490 --> 00:13:22,810
job and you pay less.

227
00:13:22,810 --> 00:13:24,090
Or do you want something in the middle.

228
00:13:24,130 --> 00:13:25,350
For me I generally go for the middle.

229
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,050
I like value personally.

230
00:13:27,290 --> 00:13:28,970
It's nice to work with an expert.

231
00:13:28,990 --> 00:13:32,260
You don't tell them much and pretend to give you something you are impressed by it but at the same time

232
00:13:32,260 --> 00:13:33,370
they kind of hurt your bank account.

233
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:37,810
So that's kind of where I kind of Goldilocks land in the middle.

234
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:38,800
Down here is fine.

235
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:41,430
I just don't want to spend that much time managing them.

236
00:13:41,430 --> 00:13:43,980
OK then you have how long does the project expect to last.

237
00:13:43,980 --> 00:13:46,120
That's I mean pretty straightforward.

238
00:13:46,120 --> 00:13:47,290
How long are you thinking to do this.

239
00:13:47,290 --> 00:13:48,560
For me it's probably one to three months.

240
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,020
I like that and then.

241
00:13:50,020 --> 00:13:51,450
Do you have time requirements now.

242
00:13:51,580 --> 00:13:55,360
The way that they're trying to make you break this down is is it full time or is it part time.

243
00:13:55,360 --> 00:13:56,790
Can they do this and a bunch of other things.

244
00:13:56,790 --> 00:13:59,120
Or should they only be doing this and then this is I don't know.

245
00:13:59,140 --> 00:14:00,070
I always picked that one.

246
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:04,180
Unless of course I was hiring one individual to do all of the videos.

247
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:08,860
In that case I might say I only want a full time person because if they're part time I might not be

248
00:14:08,860 --> 00:14:10,030
able to rely on them.

249
00:14:10,040 --> 00:14:11,570
So that's up to you.

250
00:14:11,570 --> 00:14:14,820
Do you want hire multiple people part time you and hire one person full time.

251
00:14:14,890 --> 00:14:15,940
It's just up to you.

252
00:14:15,940 --> 00:14:18,800
Sometimes it's nice to work with one person at the same time.

253
00:14:18,820 --> 00:14:24,470
It's hard to find people who are full time available and also you might have a time restriction and

254
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:25,110
when they start.

255
00:14:25,110 --> 00:14:28,840
So keep that in mind that's going to definitely lower down the pool that you're looking for.

256
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:29,960
So I say I don't know yet.

257
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:32,930
Then next then you can review your post.

258
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,730
That's great.

259
00:14:33,730 --> 00:14:33,970
OK.

260
00:14:33,970 --> 00:14:37,940
And then when you are done with that you post job now.

261
00:14:37,990 --> 00:14:40,080
OK so now what you going to do is hit this screen right here.

262
00:14:40,090 --> 00:14:43,900
Now it's after you've seen your job post you can invite freelancers or you proposals and then you can

263
00:14:43,900 --> 00:14:45,520
hire That's the general process.

264
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:51,190
Now here's where I really really strongly suggest you spend 10 20 minutes depending on what you're hiring

265
00:14:51,190 --> 00:14:51,890
for.

266
00:14:52,030 --> 00:14:57,100
If you just leave this up by itself and you go away it is a good chance you will only get like four

267
00:14:57,100 --> 00:14:59,290
or five people will apply for the next 48 hours.

268
00:14:59,390 --> 00:15:04,270
I sit here and I go to every single person and I just click invite to job and then it will automatically

269
00:15:04,270 --> 00:15:09,640
take them to my job and send invitation and I just go down and I find anybody who's matching my profile

270
00:15:09,640 --> 00:15:14,470
like if I'm ok with them being outside the country maybe their English is OK but they're a reasonably

271
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:20,680
priced person for a video editor then I might click that OK or maybe I want really really cheap editors

272
00:15:20,770 --> 00:15:25,180
which if you know if you go on the long haul then that's sometimes the rate to go.

273
00:15:25,180 --> 00:15:30,130
Then I could say $10 an hour and I want to make sure that my attention comes from people who are on

274
00:15:30,130 --> 00:15:32,560
the $10 an hour range.

275
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:35,770
There are other filters here that can be pretty useful English level.

276
00:15:35,770 --> 00:15:39,470
I don't really screw around with because they have to self-assigned their English.

277
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:45,730
So I've met a lot of native or bilingual English speakers who do not speak English very well earned

278
00:15:45,730 --> 00:15:48,250
amount just means how long they've been on the on the platform.

279
00:15:48,250 --> 00:15:49,310
Why does that matter.

280
00:15:49,340 --> 00:15:53,800
Well because that means they care about the reviews or if they have no earnings in the account that

281
00:15:53,800 --> 00:16:00,070
means that they could very easily just disappear if they have a bad experience or if they can't meet

282
00:16:00,070 --> 00:16:04,870
your deadlines they're just not going to have that reputational poll that's and require them to come

283
00:16:04,870 --> 00:16:05,540
back.

284
00:16:05,650 --> 00:16:06,720
I mean things like Job Success.

285
00:16:06,730 --> 00:16:08,370
I've got a lot of success of just all this.

286
00:16:08,380 --> 00:16:11,220
Just knowing that not very many people are going to apply if I go like this.

287
00:16:11,230 --> 00:16:15,530
But knowing that the people that apply are people that take their freelancing career seriously.

288
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,260
Some people just do it very much on the side when and if they have time and if they have a full time

289
00:16:20,260 --> 00:16:25,390
job in addition to their freelancing that sometimes can get in the way and you have periods of time

290
00:16:25,390 --> 00:16:27,710
when they disappear and don't like that freelancer type.

291
00:16:27,700 --> 00:16:28,240
That's up to you.

292
00:16:28,240 --> 00:16:32,500
I don't generally like working with agencies just because that means that there's a project management

293
00:16:32,500 --> 00:16:36,880
layer and I'm paying extra for essentially the same work especially in this situation there are situations

294
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,360
where agencies are better especially if you need creative help or creative direction.

295
00:16:40,360 --> 00:16:41,310
But in this case I don't.

296
00:16:41,320 --> 00:16:44,410
Hours build in last activity are essentially kind of an extension of this.

297
00:16:44,410 --> 00:16:49,960
It's kind of the same thing showing how active they are in the category sometimes if like so for instance

298
00:16:49,960 --> 00:16:54,970
these are key words they'll use to search sometimes I'm searching for something it doesn't necessarily

299
00:16:54,970 --> 00:17:00,490
fall within a direct category so I might say oh I only want people who match these keywords in this

300
00:17:00,490 --> 00:17:01,680
specific category.

301
00:17:01,690 --> 00:17:04,920
So friends is the like of us hiring someone for an outreach campaign.

302
00:17:04,990 --> 00:17:08,000
And I wanted them to do research online.

303
00:17:08,020 --> 00:17:12,610
Well if I type in internet research and then I don't pick a category it's going to find a lot of people

304
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:19,630
who only do internet research and they're not necessarily versed in marketing or versed in PR campaigns

305
00:17:19,630 --> 00:17:24,730
or outreach campaigns that I might want to do is type in outreach and then specifically go and find

306
00:17:24,730 --> 00:17:27,880
marketing as a category and then select that.

307
00:17:27,970 --> 00:17:29,470
OK so that's typically how I use those.

308
00:17:29,470 --> 00:17:36,610
Make sure you go and you spend some time clicking invite just to glance through these make sure they

309
00:17:36,610 --> 00:17:38,120
fit your general idea.

310
00:17:38,170 --> 00:17:41,530
Sometimes you know it's fine if you click on someone and bite them and you're like oh wait I didn't

311
00:17:41,530 --> 00:17:42,350
want that person.

312
00:17:42,370 --> 00:17:43,420
It doesn't matter right.

313
00:17:43,420 --> 00:17:46,140
Who knows if they're going to apply and if they do apply you can kind of ignore them.

314
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:47,740
Unless of course they have a great proposal.

315
00:17:47,740 --> 00:17:50,910
Keep in mind you can only invite I think it's like 50 people a day.

316
00:17:50,920 --> 00:17:58,090
But my strong suggestion is if you want to hire someone quickly and to get some of the best proposals

317
00:17:58,090 --> 00:18:01,210
that I think you should try to maximize that as much as possible.

318
00:18:01,210 --> 00:18:06,020
Also keep in mind you're hiring multiple people in multiple jobs so blow all 50 on one job.

319
00:18:06,130 --> 00:18:06,670
OK guys.

320
00:18:06,700 --> 00:18:11,530
So with that being said next lecture what we'll do is we'll go over the post I used to hire the video

321
00:18:11,530 --> 00:18:13,450
editors that I currently work with.

322
00:18:13,450 --> 00:18:18,710
We can go over some of the conversations and some of the trials that I ran.

323
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:19,180
OK.

324
00:18:19,240 --> 00:18:19,620
See the.
