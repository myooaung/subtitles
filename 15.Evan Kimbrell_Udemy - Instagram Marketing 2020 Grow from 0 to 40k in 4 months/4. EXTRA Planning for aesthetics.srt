All right, guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:07,440
So, this lecture, let's talk about something that's probably
for the people that are more serious about Instagram.
2

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:08,350
So, this lecture, let's talk about something that's probably
for the people that are more serious about Instagram.
3

4
00:00:08,430 --> 00:00:13,530
If you're just in this to grow really fast, then somehow
flip that into a business perfectly fine, you'll
4

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:17,530
meet your needs, but you might
not need this specific lecture.
5

6
00:00:17,560 --> 00:00:20,710
Anyway, we talked about Instagram
being the king of visual, right?
6

7
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:25,410
Everything that is well thought out and visually
interesting generally gets rewarded, and things that
7

8
00:00:25,410 --> 00:00:28,910
are not just generally don't perform
that well. In a similar suit,
8

9
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:34,410
those that commit to long term styling
standards also tend to do very well.
9

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,200
Now, some accounts, if you haven't noticed, have
no visual style pattern to them whatsoever.
10

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,970
One post is a white background with a quote, and
then the next one is like a landscape with no text,
11

12
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,490
then you have a selfie shot of some like goateed man.
They're just posting what comes to mind and then
12

13
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:55,080
pushing it out without any attention paid to whether the
posts will fit the general aesthetic of the account as a whole.
13

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,410
pushing it out without any attention paid to whether the
posts will fit the general aesthetic of the account as a whole.
14

15
00:00:56,470 --> 00:00:59,500
OK, let's look at an account called dude.therapy.
15

16
00:00:59,700 --> 00:01:04,990
Ok, it's not the worst account that I've seen,
but scroll through the feed just a little bit.
16

17
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:06,970
Now, what do you notice?
I'm going to tell you what I notice.
17

18
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:08,180
Now, what do you notice?
I'm going to tell you what I notice.
18

19
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:11,460
There's no real style associated with this account.
19

20
00:01:11,490 --> 00:01:16,950
I guess we could say that they do quotes a lot, but
sometimes they're memes or funny real life photos.
20

21
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:18,510
I guess we could say that they do quotes a lot, but
sometimes they're memes or funny real life photos.
21

22
00:01:18,510 --> 00:01:20,400
Each photo has a different background style.
22

23
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:26,040
Some are beige, some are plain white, and others are
brown, in black stripes, and all sorts of weird stuff.
23

24
00:01:26,070 --> 00:01:32,730
Every single post seems to have a different font as well,
so there's really no pattern to the types of posts,
24

25
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,570
the fonts used, the backgrounds,
the colors are just really anything.
25

26
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:37,010
the fonts used, the backgrounds,
the colors are just really anything.
26

27
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,480
On the other hand, let's look at another
account, this one is called The Froot Life.
27

28
00:01:41,550 --> 00:01:45,800
It's a mango drink in India.
28

29
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:47,820
And holy crap.
29

30
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,940
Look at the colors. They're all solid colors,
and are vibrant, and kind of tropical.
30

31
00:01:52,950 --> 00:01:58,020
I see the same purples and the same greens being used, and
guess what, the font is always the same as the company's.
31

32
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,050
I see the same purples and the same greens being used, and
guess what, the font is always the same as the company's.
32

33
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:02,220
The more you look at this feed,
the more it kind of looks like art.
33

34
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,060
Let's look at another one.
34

35
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:03,870
This is Everlane, which sells fancy clothes.
35

36
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:06,940
This is Everlane, which sells fancy clothes.
36

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,030
OK, let's look at the general pattern as a whole though.
37

38
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:15,810
Lots of white and gray mixed with subtle blues and browns, lots of product shots or landscapes and people shots at artistic angles.
38

39
00:02:15,810 --> 00:02:17,310
Lots of white and gray mixed with subtle blues and browns, lots of product shots or landscapes and people shots at artistic angles.
39

40
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:23,600
Same font throughout. They use a similar text placement
style as well, and they use the same models even.
40

41
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:28,670
Ok, so which of these do you think is going
to be more popular and convert more users?
41

42
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:29,060
Ok, so which of these do you think is going
to be more popular and convert more users?
42

43
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:35,130
Well, the ones that keep some kind of brand guidelines
and have some eye to how the, you know, the bird's
43

44
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:38,270
eye view of your wall or feed is going to look.
44

45
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,380
Now, talking about brands, and brand building, and brand standards pretty much lulled me to sleep, because,
45

46
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:45,120
well, it's really boring.
46

47
00:02:45,150 --> 00:02:47,080
*This is boring.*
47

48
00:02:47,160 --> 00:02:52,940
Luckily, it's something that just takes maybe 30 minutes
of work and maybe some tweaking down the road,
48

49
00:02:53,010 --> 00:02:55,620
but I think it actually can pay off in big dividends.
49

50
00:02:55,650 --> 00:03:00,870
So if we want to keep the entirety of the account
aesthetic, then what exactly do we do?
50

51
00:03:00,930 --> 00:03:06,870
Well, we first decide on a posting pattern that
we want to try and then we pick a style guide.
51

52
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,990
Now, it's not really that complicated to do this and
I personally just scribble it down in Evernote
52

53
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:17,750
somewhere. If you think your main posts
are going to be quotes, OK, great.
53

54
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:21,680
What else do you think you'll throw in
though? Here's a pattern that might work.
54

55
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,360
Two posts of quotes and one post of video.
55

56
00:03:24,390 --> 00:03:30,150
Since the Instagram wall feed is only three columns wide,
that will actually create a striping effect with your videos.
56

57
00:03:30,150 --> 00:03:31,150
Since the Instagram wall feed is only three columns wide,
that will actually create a striping effect with your videos.
57

58
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,620
If you look at thestartup.co account, that's an okay
account, but you can see that they made all of their
58

59
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:41,450
far left posts the same type.
Doesn't really matter what you do,
59

60
00:03:41,460 --> 00:03:43,580
it's just that you thought out a pattern.
60

61
00:03:43,650 --> 00:03:47,960
Not only will it make the page look better,
but it will prime your users for what to expect.
61

62
00:03:47,970 --> 00:03:49,440
People like consistency.
62

63
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:54,420
The next thing is a style guide, and that's really just
a fancy way of saying pick a color palette, then
63

64
00:03:54,510 --> 00:04:00,780
pick one or two fonts, and then pick a composition, which is basically what goes on each photo and roughly what arrangement.
64

65
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:02,660
pick one or two fonts, and then pick a composition, which is basically what goes on each photo and roughly what arrangement.
65

66
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,240
Now, the last thing you have are filters,
which are really up to you.
66

67
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:08,260
I mean, we're going to talk about filters later on.
67

68
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,870
But if you decide to use them, just make sure you use
them consistently and don't switch all over the place.
68

69
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:13,510
But if you decide to use them, just make sure you use
them consistently and don't switch all over the place.
69

70
00:04:13,600 --> 00:04:14,970
If you want to pick a color palette, it's pretty easy.
70

71
00:04:14,970 --> 00:04:16,290
If you want to pick a color palette, it's pretty easy.
71

72
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,350
Now, here are my two favorite tools. One of them is
called coolors.co, and it's a web app that basically
72

73
00:04:22,350 --> 00:04:26,490
just gives you a five color scheme, and every time
you hit the space bar it gives you a new set.
73

74
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:32,100
You can just lock the ones you want, and it'll keep
going until you have a group of ones that you like.
74

75
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:32,940
You can just lock the ones you want, and it'll keep
going until you have a group of ones that you like.
75

76
00:04:32,940 --> 00:04:34,050
It's actually pretty fun.
76

77
00:04:34,050 --> 00:04:37,680
The next tool is great if you're lazy and you
don't want to put it together yourself at all.
77

78
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:43,770
Just go to lolcolors.com, which just has curated color
palettes that work pretty well for Instagram in
78

79
00:04:43,770 --> 00:04:48,300
my experience. They're pretty colorful,
with decent contrast to them.
79

80
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,300
You really don't have to think about it.
80

81
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:52,580
Just find a set that you like and then just use it.
81

82
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:54,150
Now, fonts are up to you.
82

83
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,080
I strongly suggest that you stick with only one or two fonts,
83

84
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,950
ideally one. My courses always use Proxima Nova,
but I'll probably use like a similar-ish font
84

85
00:05:04,950 --> 00:05:06,760
in my account during this course.
85

86
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:11,040
If you're a company or a website, then just use the
font that you have on your website, you probably
86

87
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:12,620
already have a dominant font.
87

88
00:05:12,660 --> 00:05:17,240
Again, consistency really helps when you're trying
to convert people into real life customers.
88

89
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:22,290
It's kind of weird if you're looking at something that's,
let's say it's in Tahoma, and then you go to
89

90
00:05:22,290 --> 00:05:24,530
a website, and it's all in Comic Sans.
90

91
00:05:24,570 --> 00:05:28,860
OK, guys, that's all for now. Hopefully I've opened
your eyes a little bit to the broader aesthetics of
91

92
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:32,710
Instagram and how some accounts
do it well and some not so much.
92

93
00:05:32,730 --> 00:05:34,170
It's really pretty easy.
93

94
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,310
You just need to stick to a pattern of content.
94

95
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:42,200
You can change that pattern of content, but try to stick
to each pattern at least for a little bit for it to show up,
95

96
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:43,350
You can change that pattern of content, but try to stick
to each pattern at least for a little bit for it to show up,
96

97
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:48,930
so it doesn't look like you're constantly switching patterns.
Then all you need is a style guide, and that's just a fancy way
97

98
00:05:48,930 --> 00:05:53,100
of saying pick a color palette, a font, and a rough
idea of how you're going to put the things on the
98

99
00:05:53,100 --> 00:05:54,960
page, and you're pretty much good to go.
99

100
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:55,380
All right, guys.
100

101
00:05:55,380 --> 00:06:00,510
Next up, we'll talk about some of my favorite accounts that
I think are worth studying for content strategy inspiration.
101

102
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:01,410
Next up, we'll talk about some of my favorite accounts that

102

103
00:06:01,410 --> 00:06:02,050
Stay tuned.
