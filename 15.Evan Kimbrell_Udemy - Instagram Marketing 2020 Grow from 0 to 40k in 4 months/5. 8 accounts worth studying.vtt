00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:07.650
And we are back. Quick lecture, hopefully. Since we talked
about what content options we have, how to make
1

2
00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.260
our brand or personal account fit into some broader
scheme of Instagram, I thought it would be helpful to just
2

3
00:00:13.260 --> 00:00:18.780
go over some accounts that exemplify some of
the standards that I've been spouting off about.
3

4
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:24.200
Now, some of these are impressive, because, well, good
God, how do you make an Instagram out of that?
4

5
00:00:24.210 --> 00:00:27.170
Some are just killing it with content variety.
5

6
00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:29.790
And others are great just for the sheer creativity.
6

7
00:00:29.790 --> 00:00:30.000
All right.
7

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:30.930
So let's get into it.
8

9
00:00:30.930 --> 00:00:32.960
First off, let's take a look at Buffer.
9

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.980
Now, we'll actually use Buffer later on in the course, but their social media strategies are pretty much always worth following.
10

11
00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:39.340
Now, we'll actually use Buffer later on in the course, but their social media strategies are pretty much always worth following.
11

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:43.240
They create an app that helps you
schedule posts for social media - cool.
12

13
00:00:43.670 --> 00:00:49.560
It's a classic example of a software that just moves
widgets and code for some unvisual output.
13

14
00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:51.130
It's a classic example of a software that just moves
widgets and code for some unvisual output.
14

15
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:52.780
So take it from them.
15

16
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:58.620
Anyone, really anyone can run a successful Instagram.
They post all sorts of photos and they try to almost
16

17
00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:01.410
build like a lifestyle around their company.
17

18
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.390
Now, one thing that's interesting about them is that
every employee is remote, so they often hit on that
18

19
00:01:06.390 --> 00:01:11.910
theme quite a bit, and they also work on building
up these hashtags, and things like that.
19

20
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:13.930
They also hit on productivity.
20

21
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:21.000
So they have nothing visual, but they just looked at the 
themes that their users like, or follow, or whatever
21

22
00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.480
they could kind of paste on top of what they do.
Productivity and remote living - there you go.
22

23
00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.140
they could kind of paste on top of what they do.
Productivity and remote living - there you go.
23

24
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:25.320
All right.
24

25
00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:30.750
Next up, we have the Foundr, and we've actually
covered them before, but again, it's worth looking at.
25

26
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:35.490
Now, they're a magazine in Australia for entrepreneurs
and they've always been pretty big on Instagram.
26

27
00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:40.500
They're not the best visual appeal, but they do a really
good job of mixing in different types of content
27

28
00:01:40.530 --> 00:01:42.820
while always keeping a consistent pattern.
28

29
00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:45.580
Now, you'll notice they mostly do
quotes with the same style,
29

30
00:01:45.590 --> 00:01:50.430
they have a solid background with the logo at the
bottom, and then they break it up with profiles of
30

31
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:53.540
people they interview, and occasionally shots of their book.
31

32
00:01:53.550 --> 00:01:57.210
It's also worth noting that they advertise an insane amount
32

33
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:02.490
actually, they get product plugs into
their feeds almost every single day.
33

34
00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:09.240
They're also pretty well known for how often
they do promotions with other accounts.
34

35
00:02:09.240 --> 00:02:10.500
We'll talk about that later.
35

36
00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.750
But they do an insane amount of promotions.
36

37
00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:15.370
It's kind of like an account on overdrive.
37

38
00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:16.380
Next up, number three.
38

39
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:17.650
Let's look at Lewis Howes.
39

40
00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:20.580
He's a personality account, and
that's pretty much all about him.
40

41
00:02:20.580 --> 00:02:25.710
Honestly, I don't know what he does, but
he sells a lot of things with his face on it.
41

42
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:27.240
He does a good job of this
42

43
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:33.270
generally. He throws in bits about himself or quotes
from his appearances, and then some behind the
43

44
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:39.350
scenes on how he does what he does,
or who he's working with, or where he is.
44

45
00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:45.000
And he sometimes even throws in some quotes, sometimes they're from him, sometimes they're from, I don't know, people
45

46
00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.200
that are inspiring.
46

47
00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:49.800
What's mentionable though is that he really
understands his audience and what they want.
47

48
00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:50.070
What's mentionable though is that he really
understands his audience and what they want.
48

49
00:02:50.070 --> 00:02:51.950
They want motivation, quick one liners,
and then behind the scenes.
49

50
00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.220
They want motivation, quick one liners,
and then behind the scenes.
50

51
00:02:53.220 --> 00:02:54.620
They want motivation, quick one liners,
and then behind the scenes.
51

52
00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:57.270
So he does a really good job of capturing those three.
52

53
00:02:57.270 --> 00:02:58.350
I'm interested in this stuff,
53

54
00:02:58.350 --> 00:03:05.010
I'm interested in him, that lends itself to behind the
scenes, and quotes, and just clips of other stuff.
54

55
00:03:05.010 --> 00:03:06.450
Next up, we have Kettle and Fire.
55

56
00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:10.920
Now, again, I'm a little biased, because this is a company
from one of my co-instructors, but it's worth checking
56

57
00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:16.020
them out, because Instagram has worked really well for them
in the past, and let's be honest, they're a soup company.
57

58
00:03:16.020 --> 00:03:17.160
them out, because Instagram has worked really well for them
in the past, and let's be honest, they're a soup company.
58

59
00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.320
How do you run a full time account selling soup?
59

60
00:03:20.550 --> 00:03:23.960
Well, they seem to have figured out what works.
60

61
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:29.240
They do a lot of these lifestyle shots,
pretty food shots, and then recipes.
61

62
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.390
I think, given the parameters they're in,
they've done a pretty good job.
62

63
00:03:33.390 --> 00:03:35.340
How do you make soup into an account?
63

64
00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.680
You make it into a soup-like lifestyle.
64

65
00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:43.470
Lots of plaid, and lots of outdoorsy stuff,
and raw carrots ready to be cut, whatever.
65

66
00:03:43.470 --> 00:03:44.920
Next up, we have FedEx.
66

67
00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.160
And yeah, I know.
67

68
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:52.800
OK, it's not a brand you would expect to crush it on
photo sharing, but they actually are, and it's a weird
68

69
00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:58.810
way. Virtually everything they post is user
generated content - UGC, if you're cool.
69

70
00:03:58.950 --> 00:04:04.370
They just ask people to post photos of their packages,
planes, and trucks, and then they just retweet it.
70

71
00:04:04.410 --> 00:04:10.360
They call it something like "FedEx in the wild"
with a hashtag, and it actually really works.
71

72
00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:15.630
It becomes a game that people just take photos of the
FedEx truck and that's it, and that populates their feed,
72

73
00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.160
they never post anything themselves.
73

74
00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:22.530
Number six worth checking out is Honest company
at @honest, and yeah, I don't really know how
74

75
00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:29.470
this company has raised as much money as it has,
and all it does is sell baby diapers and trinkets,
75

76
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:31.600
but hey, if it works, it works.
76

77
00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:35.760
Anyway, special points go to them for the variety
of content they use in a pretty consistent pattern,
77

78
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.990
and the effort they put into making
their color palettes pretty consistent.
78

79
00:04:39.990 --> 00:04:40.860
Worth checking out.
79

80
00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:45.900
There's obviously some production behind that one,
so you can't exactly copy that, but it did a pretty good
80

81
00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:46.890
job with the basics.
81

82
00:04:46.890 --> 00:04:53.280
Number seven is thestartup.co, which is
just notable purely for their posting cadence.
82

83
00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.830
We mentioned them before, but just look at their page, like,
every third post is the same composition or the same color.
83

84
00:04:57.840 --> 00:04:58.920
We mentioned them before, but just look at their page, like,
every third post is the same composition or the same color.
84

85
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.770
So that's, I don't know, interesting enough to take a gander,
might give you some ideas, there's nothing else I can say.
85

86
00:05:03.770 --> 00:05:04.360
So that's, I don't know, interesting enough to take a gander,
might give you some ideas, there's nothing else I can say.
86

87
00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:09.110
And then last but not least is Tim Ferriss, and he's
the guy that wrote The 4-Hour Workweek and The
87

88
00:05:09.110 --> 00:05:15.520
4-Hour [something something] and his entire brand is
based on productivity and what he calls life hacking.
88

89
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:16.610
4-Hour [something something] and his entire brand is
based on productivity and what he calls life hacking.
89

90
00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:21.530
His account is pretty notable though, because he's built
the entire thing around his podcasts, and promoting
90

91
00:05:21.530 --> 00:05:23.230
the people that are featured on it.
91

92
00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:28.940
Each post has a number of the podcast on it and has
an in-depth story about the person being covered.
92

93
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.350
Stories are great content, but can
be pretty hard to pull off.
93

94
00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:38.150
They do it well and they promote their podcast, which
is the mainstay of their business, and they do it
94

95
00:05:38.150 --> 00:05:40.030
without sounding spammy.
95

96
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:44.910
It's not like, "Go to our podcast!" It's just, "Coming
up on our podcast, here's something interesting."
96

97
00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:49.870
And it's also worth looking at how creatively they place
their ads, they have a lot of product placements in there.
97

98
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:50.250
And it's also worth looking at how creatively they place
their ads, they have a lot of product placements in there.
98

99
00:05:50.410 --> 00:05:53.570
So they make a lot of money doing that,
and they've done it pretty well.
99

100
00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:56.000
All right, guys, that's more than enough to work with.
100

101
00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:59.000
Take some time, get some inspiration, or not - I don't care.
101

102
00:05:59.000 --> 00:05:59.930
I'll see you in the next lecture.
