00:00:00,380 --> 00:00:01,610
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,100
OK.

3
00:00:02,160 --> 00:00:08,830
This lecture that we're going to do is Rafal long as I set up our Instagram live giveaway.

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:14,070
Now the idea here is that I'm going to try to give away something I did a poll earlier.

5
00:00:14,110 --> 00:00:20,150
What people want an eco dot or a instax six Polaroid camera people one of the Echo datt.

6
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,930
So what I'm going to do and because we're a themed account we're kind of limited right now.

7
00:00:24,930 --> 00:00:30,000
This is a personal account I just flipped over my phone and just start talking to it or do a Q and A.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,280
Or something like that.

9
00:00:31,680 --> 00:00:32,750
And if I was a business.

10
00:00:32,790 --> 00:00:38,100
Yeah I kind of do the same thing like a tutorial or a walkthrough but my face isn't really on this as

11
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:39,260
it seemed to count right.

12
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:46,950
So it's kind of anonymous which means what I'm going to try to do is do my Instagram live by pointing

13
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:50,820
it directly at an iPad mini.

14
00:00:50,880 --> 00:00:52,890
So I have an iPad mini.

15
00:00:53,010 --> 00:00:57,460
It's been sitting on my shelf for quite some time I don't know why I own it.

16
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:03,180
And what I'm going to do is just create an image on Kanva and then I'm just going to point the camera

17
00:01:03,270 --> 00:01:03,880
at that.

18
00:01:03,930 --> 00:01:08,670
Now the reason why I'm using this iPad is just because it has a vertical screen and and lives there

19
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:11,000
are always going to in portrait mode so it makes it a little bit easier.

20
00:01:11,010 --> 00:01:13,640
But you could absolutely do this just with your computer.

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,410
You could even do it with a piece of paper.

22
00:01:15,410 --> 00:01:20,780
I've seen people do that you can just get creative It doesn't really matter because again it's alive.

23
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:22,930
So it's not supposed to be high production quality.

24
00:01:23,010 --> 00:01:26,320
And this is the first time I'm doing this so keep in mind there'll be some kinks.

25
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:34,960
OK so on my iPad I have Kanva downloaded and then I have a blog graphic because it's a portrait size.

26
00:01:35,370 --> 00:01:40,790
And when I save this on an open as a photo I can zoom in to kind of make it fit the screen.

27
00:01:41,010 --> 00:01:44,600
It's not going to be perfect but as long as people can read it we should be fine.

28
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:50,850
OK so first off we need an image for the Amazon echo.

29
00:01:50,930 --> 00:01:57,600
And really if I was doing this was maybe a little more prepared what I would do is do multiple screens

30
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,760
like the first screens like the giveaways in 15 minutes and then tries to garner some time to get people

31
00:02:02,760 --> 00:02:03,360
to join.

32
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,880
But the problem I'm having is just I don't really know how to swipe between photos to get that going.

33
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:10,210
I could try though.

34
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:20,100
So let's go to Google images go images so we can get the Amazon echo image.

35
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:28,440
To you image.

36
00:02:28,470 --> 00:02:29,610
Great.

37
00:02:29,740 --> 00:02:33,170
Kanva object or blog graphic.

38
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:35,190
Pull this side thing out.

39
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:38,140
So what I do is I just get uploads to photos.

40
00:02:38,270 --> 00:02:38,750
OK.

41
00:02:38,790 --> 00:02:39,900
He's accessed my photos.

42
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,490
Great.

43
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:40,950
OK.

44
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:41,400
There we go.

45
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:42,170
Perfect.

46
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:43,920
Now we have that thing.

47
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:45,260
Amazon I go there.

48
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:45,680
OK.

49
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,560
So yeah maybe it will make two different screens.

50
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:52,260
So it's put some text in.

51
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:57,700
We're not going to make this match the text from everything else because we don't have all those fonts

52
00:02:57,700 --> 00:02:59,130
is or kind of Instagram fonts.

53
00:03:02,060 --> 00:03:03,060
Great.

54
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:07,290
Pick a font that doesn't look looks somewhat like it.

55
00:03:07,550 --> 00:03:14,160
So you don't want Abdal fat face on something and actually fits what we were using before

56
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:21,200
it's copied.

57
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:24,970
Put the text in here and I'll say

58
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:35,100
just so I can prime them a little bit to know what it's about to happen to change the font size.

59
00:03:37,940 --> 00:03:42,330
And decorating this stuff was really hard on your iPad.

60
00:03:42,850 --> 00:03:44,880
We will try our best.

61
00:03:44,890 --> 00:03:50,260
So color skillet it like a red color.

62
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:56,110
And when these pastel Reds OK.

63
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:00,510
Not brilliant but should be good enough to get the point across.

64
00:04:00,530 --> 00:04:00,870
Right.

65
00:04:00,950 --> 00:04:09,050
So now what I need is a download so Dalen is an image go right.

66
00:04:09,110 --> 00:04:09,390
All right.

67
00:04:09,400 --> 00:04:10,660
That's what it's going to look like.

68
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:11,320
Right.

69
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:17,220
So I click it can zoom in like that and that should get the point across.

70
00:04:17,270 --> 00:04:22,250
The Echo looks really pixilated but honestly it's probably just because of the size of the image on

71
00:04:22,250 --> 00:04:23,410
the whole I can do about that.

72
00:04:23,410 --> 00:04:27,240
So maybe I want to maybe shrink the size of it or something.

73
00:04:29,110 --> 00:04:32,530
See how that looks.

74
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:36,240
A little messy using your fingers.

75
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:46,790
Fortunately so at download so that make sure it's saved or photos check or photos this is probably a

76
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:48,980
lot easier if you guys have an android version.

77
00:04:49,060 --> 00:04:53,980
You have a lot more control but you can do it on this one and you can do it on anything.

78
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:57,800
So that is what will probably start with zoom in like that.

79
00:04:57,830 --> 00:04:58,710
OK.

80
00:04:58,840 --> 00:05:00,300
And then yeah.

81
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:05,310
So what I'll do is I'll take my phone and pointed at it and all should have an image right here.

82
00:05:05,330 --> 00:05:10,550
You can see kind of set up I was using I'm using this tiny little stand like this that you plug into

83
00:05:10,550 --> 00:05:11,920
your phone.

84
00:05:11,950 --> 00:05:13,220
Props these legs out.

85
00:05:13,220 --> 00:05:14,130
This thing was like.

86
00:05:14,270 --> 00:05:16,430
So I think it is $8 or something.

87
00:05:16,550 --> 00:05:17,640
Ironically on Amazon.

88
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:25,420
And then what I'll do it I'll just swipe over like that and pension's zoom probably.

89
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:26,980
And that's pretty much how I run this.

90
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,380
Now it's not going to be pretty but this is a first run out.

91
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:34,430
If you guys are watching a follow along we'll probably try to perfect this a little bit assuming that

92
00:05:34,790 --> 00:05:36,320
we actually get some followers from it.

93
00:05:36,590 --> 00:05:37,510
That's a big thing too.

94
00:05:37,550 --> 00:05:42,680
So we'll need to check our followers to make sure that we know how many we go into it.

95
00:05:42,680 --> 00:05:47,780
Right now we have 26000 So that's kind of the number to see if that moves because we'll we'll see if

96
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:49,460
we at least get a couple of hundred from it.

97
00:05:49,460 --> 00:05:52,630
If not then it's probably not worth it but hey it's worth doing.

98
00:05:52,760 --> 00:05:55,250
OK so to take the second one lead it.

99
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:57,430
So I don't confused.

100
00:05:57,800 --> 00:05:58,150
OK.

101
00:05:58,160 --> 00:05:59,700
Now back to Canada.

102
00:05:59,900 --> 00:06:01,050
We'll give them the actual instructions.

103
00:06:01,100 --> 00:06:03,010
This is something I kind of struggled with.

104
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:09,530
I wanted to give them like a riddle or something where they it's kind of like hard to answer but the

105
00:06:09,530 --> 00:06:11,900
problem is that the internet ruins everything.

106
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,830
So there's no like a riddle I can ask them that they can't just Google.

107
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,850
So I don't really know how to prevent that.

108
00:06:19,850 --> 00:06:25,070
I think I'm missing let people know that it's going to run for 15 minutes and they won't know who the

109
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,900
first person answer is.

110
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:30,470
So at the very end of it then I'll say the winner is.

111
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:30,900
OK.

112
00:06:30,920 --> 00:06:35,920
And I don't know what all this will be hard to do it on the screen as I'm looking at it.

113
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:40,970
So it be hard to type in like who the winner is most likely have to do it as a post right afterwards

114
00:06:41,330 --> 00:06:44,350
and do they I'll say in that post this is the winner and I'll put in a story.

115
00:06:44,450 --> 00:06:45,100
OK.

116
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:47,230
I think that's the best way to do it.

117
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:51,800
I mean if I had a better set up than I could reach over and type it in as it's live you want to make

118
00:06:51,800 --> 00:06:58,470
sure that people in a give away believe what you're doing and believe what you're saying.

119
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,420
So yes.

120
00:07:00,770 --> 00:07:01,450
We'll see.

121
00:07:01,730 --> 00:07:04,590
Right now we're really just kind of demonstrating the bli features.

122
00:07:04,610 --> 00:07:06,100
So that's really the focus.

123
00:07:06,350 --> 00:07:08,740
OK so I'll make one more see.

124
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:09,230
OK.

125
00:07:09,230 --> 00:07:13,320
So I'll take this text or say

126
00:07:16,330 --> 00:07:16,940
rules

127
00:07:21,710 --> 00:07:23,670
and give them two instructions.

128
00:07:23,670 --> 00:07:25,140
So I'm going to try.

129
00:07:25,140 --> 00:07:27,450
And again this takes a lot of trial there.

130
00:07:27,450 --> 00:07:31,500
Number one is you have to answer this question and then the second thing is they're going to have to

131
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:33,570
tag people.

132
00:07:33,660 --> 00:07:37,560
OK so what I'm thinking is if you get the answer right and tag as many people say whoever gets the right

133
00:07:37,710 --> 00:07:39,680
tags most people that's who wins.

134
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:44,060
And I think that the tagging thing hopefully hopefully it's not too tacky and it's something that people

135
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:44,970
will actually do.

136
00:07:44,970 --> 00:07:46,710
So what I'll say is

137
00:07:55,450 --> 00:07:58,710
then the last thing I'll just be like whoever gets it right.

138
00:07:59,140 --> 00:07:59,650
So

139
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:08,450
OK.

140
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,050
So there's a little bit smaller

141
00:08:15,260 --> 00:08:16,310
to this.

142
00:08:16,380 --> 00:08:17,130
Twenty eight

143
00:08:21,060 --> 00:08:22,750
OK so then I'll at the riddle.

144
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:25,670
I need to just copy this and then make it really small.

145
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,870
So I pulled up a riddle just online.

146
00:08:27,880 --> 00:08:28,980
It's a tech.

147
00:08:29,120 --> 00:08:31,980
It's kind of lame but I don't know what riddle they can't just look up.

148
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:33,250
That's the biggest problem I have.

149
00:08:33,250 --> 00:08:33,670
So

150
00:08:43,970 --> 00:08:48,670
OK so I think that's relatively easy to read.

151
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:55,250
Just do some second changes to make sure it looks like crap.

152
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,960
OK.

153
00:09:00,460 --> 00:09:01,340
That's pretty much it.

154
00:09:01,340 --> 00:09:04,660
I'm going to add is just a name up at the top.

155
00:09:04,660 --> 00:09:10,160
It says what the prize is I'll make this a different color.

156
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,280
It turns out a little bit

157
00:09:15,210 --> 00:09:15,670
OK.

158
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,370
So there we go now and we're going to download this now as an image and we'll check that the image is

159
00:09:20,370 --> 00:09:22,570
OK and then we should be good to go.

160
00:09:22,590 --> 00:09:27,150
Then I'll just be a matter of me setting this up make sure we save it.

161
00:09:27,150 --> 00:09:38,800
So hopefully what it will look like like that and I'll have to just reach over Penge over this.

162
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:39,590
There we go.

163
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:42,560
Well position like that.

164
00:09:42,680 --> 00:09:43,140
OK.

165
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:45,180
So that's hopefully what will look like.

166
00:09:45,470 --> 00:09:46,900
You'll see how this works.

167
00:09:46,910 --> 00:09:50,450
I will save the Instagram wise and we'll upload it.

168
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:52,250
Hopefully nothing falls apart.

169
00:09:52,430 --> 00:09:57,560
Hopefully this works out I can figure it out but you will learn from my mistakes either way.

170
00:09:57,650 --> 00:09:58,040
All right.

171
00:09:58,070 --> 00:09:58,600
See you then.
