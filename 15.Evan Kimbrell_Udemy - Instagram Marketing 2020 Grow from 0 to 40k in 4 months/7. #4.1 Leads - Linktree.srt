00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,590
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:07,020
So this lecture and talk about the fourth way that you can potentially make money on Instagram.

3
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,050
And that is through leads.

4
00:00:09,060 --> 00:00:15,720
Now when I say leads I mean that you have some other business model or business that resides outside

5
00:00:15,720 --> 00:00:21,500
of Instagram and that you're going to use Instagram as a DB generator for that other business.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:24,360
Now how you make money on that other business.

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:28,140
I mean there could be a hundred different ways you can do it but the most common ways are going to be

8
00:00:28,140 --> 00:00:34,830
things like driving people to a blog and your blog is monetized or driving people to an email list and

9
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,270
you use e-mail marketing to monetize them.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,590
Or it could be that is the case that you sell your own stuff on say like an e-commerce site.

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:44,750
But that's again off of instagram.

12
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:46,320
But I don't think it's just limited to those.

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,150
I mean you could have a local business and you make an Instagram account that's related to that and

14
00:00:51,150 --> 00:00:56,730
then you use the traffic from there to get funneled into leads and you can then somehow turn those into

15
00:00:56,730 --> 00:00:57,630
something you work on.

16
00:00:57,630 --> 00:01:03,630
I've seen this work with even web development companies who just post about technology and then they

17
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:11,710
use the link in their bio to drive people to either sign up for a free console on to build a web site

18
00:01:11,910 --> 00:01:17,250
or directly just to their Web site where then they can see what's in your portfolio and how to reach

19
00:01:17,250 --> 00:01:18,000
out to you.

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,800
So I'm not going to say what it is that you use to make money but I'm going to show you how you can

21
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,820
kind of bridge to bridge Instagram with your outside business.

22
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:29,190
And this is a powerful way of using Instagram.

23
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:35,230
Not everybody needs to grow their own massive native Instagram follower base.

24
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:39,530
It's actually quite powerful even if you have like 5000 followers.

25
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:41,860
It just depends on how valuable a lead is.

26
00:01:41,940 --> 00:01:47,370
If you only sell it say it like digital music or something that maybe the maximum value can get from

27
00:01:47,370 --> 00:01:53,040
someone is 10 bucks but if you sell a high ticket item or you're during consulting services one lead

28
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:55,010
could potentially mean thousands of dollars.

29
00:01:55,110 --> 00:01:57,530
So what to do this lecture as I might show you a pretty cool tool.

30
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:03,690
It's called Link tree and I to show you how you can set that up pretty easily in your bio and then use

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:07,250
that as a way to funnel traffic to whatever it is you use off the platform.

32
00:02:07,380 --> 00:02:08,620
OK so this is what it looks like.

33
00:02:08,670 --> 00:02:10,430
It's called Link tree.

34
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:16,080
Yeah I believe that's the stony suffix for domains.

35
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,020
There's another one called link in bio and that's made by later and you might think that hey why don't

36
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,170
you show me this one because it's made by later and we use later for auto scheduling.

37
00:02:26,190 --> 00:02:31,440
But I'm actually more interested in a linkage because they were the first to do this and they have a

38
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,360
lot more features and they're easier to use.

39
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,600
Perfectly happy you guys know if you want to check out linked in bio to see what the difference is.

40
00:02:37,740 --> 00:02:42,510
They're kind of jockeying between the two or every other week it seems like they change their features.

41
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:45,300
So it's very hard to say right now which one's better.

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,580
Personally I think I have a preference for Link tree though like a cigarette linked tree with.

43
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,650
Yes the domain suffix.

44
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:57,000
And so the basic idea here is what they're going to do is you're going to set up a mobile optimized

45
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,220
Web site that they've tested over and over and over again with Instagram.

46
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:02,370
And then you're going to change your bio.

47
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:07,800
See that tree link right there so that anybody who clicks on it then gets taken to this mobile optimized

48
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:11,280
site and you use that to then funnel people in whatever direction you want them to go to.

49
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,750
It's pretty simple and it's also pretty useful if say like you're a creative or a content creator or

50
00:03:18,750 --> 00:03:22,680
something like that where you have multiple destinations you might want people to go when you want them

51
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:23,440
to go see your blog.

52
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:28,410
We also Im torn between maybe I want my traffic to come in contact me instead.

53
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,380
While this can cater to what you're looking for.

54
00:03:31,380 --> 00:03:36,240
So go to the website you sign up with and keep in mind though if you do like using this it does have

55
00:03:36,240 --> 00:03:37,410
pricing.

56
00:03:37,620 --> 00:03:42,600
The free version gives you a lot but if you pay six bucks a month which is really not much then you

57
00:03:42,600 --> 00:03:48,420
can really kind of go pro at this or move their branding use a lot more of the tools they have.

58
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,980
Personally I'm find using the free version but if you guys like it then you can upgrade from free to

59
00:03:52,980 --> 00:03:53,340
paid.

60
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:55,150
So go here you're like sign up for Instagram.

61
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:57,430
OK then all you have to do is authorize your account gool.

62
00:03:57,450 --> 00:04:00,110
Then it's an auto populate your full name and you can put your email

63
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:05,370
then you can decide which one you want to go with the words.

64
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:06,410
Use the free version.

65
00:04:06,410 --> 00:04:06,660
All right.

66
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,640
Now is this really a simple on the right side.

67
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,210
We have a preview screen of what it's going to look like when someone clicks a button and they've already

68
00:04:12,210 --> 00:04:17,820
put our handle and our logo in there for us so that's a good head start.

69
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,950
Now up here it says my bio link and this is where you can customize this to whatever it is that you

70
00:04:22,950 --> 00:04:24,270
want to believe you have to customize this.

71
00:04:24,270 --> 00:04:29,170
You have to be a free account that doesn't really matter because people are used to seeing link trees.

72
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:31,350
And if you have it slash your name well.

73
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:34,940
And that gives it enough credibility that people might actually be interested and clicking on it.

74
00:04:34,980 --> 00:04:35,490
OK.

75
00:04:35,760 --> 00:04:41,670
So over here all you have to do is add new button or link to add a section where you can link people

76
00:04:41,670 --> 00:04:43,180
to whatever it is that you want.

77
00:04:43,290 --> 00:04:46,090
So let's say we wanted to link them to a blog.

78
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:46,400
OK.

79
00:04:46,410 --> 00:04:50,830
So then right here we have a title and then a u r l and it's quite really simple.

80
00:04:50,850 --> 00:05:01,540
So go my title it's a blog about innovation OK and then we'll put the L we don't have a blog about innovation

81
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,250
but I'll link them to let's say my account.

82
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:07,660
So this is my blog.

83
00:05:07,990 --> 00:05:08,660
OK.

84
00:05:08,770 --> 00:05:13,660
All right now when you click that little info button and slide this on now you can see hey look we've

85
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:15,850
added a little button right there.

86
00:05:15,850 --> 00:05:19,960
Then we can check out some of these other features so here we can add an image but you have to be linked

87
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,010
to the pro for the most part.

88
00:05:22,090 --> 00:05:25,120
You know if this really works out for you then you can start adding thumbnails.

89
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,660
But keep in mind this is all about conversion.

90
00:05:27,670 --> 00:05:28,220
OK.

91
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:32,470
So if someone clicks your link tree by on they see this and it looks like he spent a whole lot of time

92
00:05:32,470 --> 00:05:37,000
trying to make it beautiful then that actually might lower your conversion so keep that in mind.

93
00:05:37,070 --> 00:05:42,910
Dave another section called priority links and that is just in case say you have like 10 different links

94
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,050
you can mark some of them as priority and what that does it just makes them show up at the top.

95
00:05:47,050 --> 00:05:47,980
It's really that simple.

96
00:05:47,980 --> 00:05:49,870
Here is a schedule link function.

97
00:05:49,870 --> 00:05:55,930
This again would be say if you're doing a flash sale and you want people to go specifically to let's

98
00:05:55,930 --> 00:06:00,070
say one product page or something that's time sensitive what you can do is you can schedule your link

99
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,360
so if I know this week I'm selling one item next week I'm selling another and click that button and

100
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:07,930
have them scheduled so I don't have to keep going in and removing these as I go.

101
00:06:07,930 --> 00:06:12,010
And then last thing here is link click so this will show you how many people have clicked your link.

102
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:15,940
Keep in mind Instagram actually tell you how many people have clicked your link.

103
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:21,420
So if you go to Instagram and just look at the basic analytics you'll get numbers that say link clicks.

104
00:06:21,430 --> 00:06:24,210
Also if you remember this iconic square does this as well.

105
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,020
You actually have an entire section that says how many people over time have clicked it.

106
00:06:28,030 --> 00:06:31,520
So that's a great way of checking if I change the wording.

107
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:35,240
How many people have clicked it and then the last thing is you can just throw it away.

108
00:06:35,290 --> 00:06:41,800
Now here is where you would just move this button so that you can rearrange it yourself so let's add

109
00:06:41,800 --> 00:06:44,210
another button let's say bye.

110
00:06:44,260 --> 00:06:45,580
Cool stuff.

111
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:51,760
So this would make sense if you know enervation station we were selling any of the items that we cover

112
00:06:51,790 --> 00:06:54,140
which actually happens all the time.

113
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:56,890
People keep asking like Harry where do we buy this.

114
00:06:56,890 --> 00:06:58,890
So it actually could be pretty interesting.

115
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:00,730
Buy my stuff.

116
00:07:00,730 --> 00:07:06,340
If we had a second button where they could go and find whatever it is that they're looking at and one

117
00:07:06,340 --> 00:07:11,170
smart thing you could do is that if I added a new item today that means people with attention are going

118
00:07:11,170 --> 00:07:14,830
to be on it today then I could put that item right there.

119
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,340
So most likely anybody who's going be clicking on this could be interested in it.

120
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,810
And then in the post what I can do is just post and say if you're interested in buying this link in

121
00:07:22,810 --> 00:07:23,480
the bio.

122
00:07:23,590 --> 00:07:26,450
OK and then let's say I wanted to put one other on.

123
00:07:26,470 --> 00:07:30,850
And this is going to be just a contact me button me.

124
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:33,100
Now there's a lot more ways you can handle this.

125
00:07:33,370 --> 00:07:35,820
You could link them to the contact form on your blog.

126
00:07:35,830 --> 00:07:42,250
You can want them to the contact page on your local store like a Google place page.

127
00:07:42,310 --> 00:07:45,520
In this case what we can do is a little bit of a hack because I just want people to e-mail me.

128
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:47,570
I could just say mail too.

129
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,030
OK.

130
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:55,530
Now that's a code such that if someone clicks it it tells their computer hey open up a fresh e-mail.

131
00:07:55,590 --> 00:07:55,840
OK.

132
00:07:55,840 --> 00:07:59,680
So then I would say mail to and then my e-mail address.

133
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:00,320
Cool.

134
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:00,830
OK.

135
00:08:00,830 --> 00:08:02,650
And then I turn this on and bam there we go.

136
00:08:02,650 --> 00:08:04,770
Contact me by cool stuff blog about innovation.

137
00:08:04,790 --> 00:08:10,330
Now I might rearrange these just so that it's whatever priority I think is most important.

138
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:15,730
I think contact me is kind of like a catch all for everything that's not related to these other things.

139
00:08:15,910 --> 00:08:18,180
So I usually use that as a last resort.

140
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:22,170
But if you guys are a business that uses a leads and you're on the phone or good on e-mail then that

141
00:08:22,170 --> 00:08:24,000
might be something you throw up at the top.

142
00:08:24,010 --> 00:08:26,620
OK now last thing we want to check out our pretty simple.

143
00:08:26,620 --> 00:08:32,050
Go to settings and we can change the color so they automatically give us looks like some color schemes

144
00:08:32,050 --> 00:08:36,820
that match my logo I don't know if that's coincidence or want but that right there kind of looks like

145
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:39,360
my logo that also looks like my logo.

146
00:08:39,400 --> 00:08:43,600
I think I like this one a little bit better actually.

147
00:08:43,780 --> 00:08:44,590
I'll go with this one.

148
00:08:44,650 --> 00:08:47,890
And then if you want to customize your theme while you get to pay the six bucks so it's not that big

149
00:08:47,890 --> 00:08:48,790
of a deal anyway.

150
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:50,410
So that was pretty much it.

151
00:08:50,410 --> 00:08:56,560
And now I can use this as a mobile optimized landing page that I know convert's really well so I can

152
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,650
put this link already just in my bio and pretty much good to go.

153
00:09:00,820 --> 00:09:08,200
OK so if we went over to my account I could do this or would it just want to go over to edit profile

154
00:09:08,740 --> 00:09:14,010
and then where it says Web site that's where I'm going to put my link and just yes

155
00:09:18,070 --> 00:09:18,480
slash

156
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:28,410
wink are dot the innovation station

157
00:09:31,290 --> 00:09:35,810
and station okay that that's deal it done and we all there we go.

158
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:42,140
Now we actually have a link in our bio now to point out probably two different things one remember when

159
00:09:42,140 --> 00:09:47,150
we talked about Lincs we were setting up our account your link is pretty much your main driver of business.

160
00:09:47,150 --> 00:09:52,740
So it would make sense in this case that I change my last line to actually highlight that hey there

161
00:09:52,740 --> 00:09:54,720
is a link so I need to do a call to action.

162
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:56,240
Otherwise people dont know why.

163
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:57,880
For instance if you click on that link.

164
00:09:57,940 --> 00:10:02,090
Now obviously you can do this in posts you can click on the link in the bio to check out whatever this

165
00:10:02,210 --> 00:10:04,140
whatever the theme of the post was.

166
00:10:04,220 --> 00:10:08,690
But for the most part people who my profile who didn't necessarily come from one of those pages are

167
00:10:08,690 --> 00:10:11,660
not going to see that link because they have nothing that's driving them to it.

168
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:13,190
So what I want to do is change that.

169
00:10:13,190 --> 00:10:18,950
Put an arrow down and say click the link to contact me or click the link to find out more to see cool

170
00:10:18,950 --> 00:10:20,340
tech or whatever it is.

171
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,370
My main goal is now the second thing I'll point out is that you guys can actually use your real short

172
00:10:25,370 --> 00:10:29,210
inners Now that might actually be useful but it's really kind of up to you.

173
00:10:29,210 --> 00:10:33,440
For instance I have the custom short enter and then dot It's Evan K..

174
00:10:33,500 --> 00:10:37,670
I m OK so if my account is called Evan Kimbrell that might actually be a better link for someone to

175
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:38,230
click on.

176
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,840
But for the most part people recognize link tree so it's not the end of the world but if you really

177
00:10:41,840 --> 00:10:45,060
want more control in your branding I would probably use a linked corner.

178
00:10:45,070 --> 00:10:50,270
Again I don't suggest using TITLEY because people just have an unfortunate association with Billy being

179
00:10:50,270 --> 00:10:53,200
linked to something that is not great right.

180
00:10:53,210 --> 00:10:55,810
Because why else would someone want to mask the name of their link.

181
00:10:55,910 --> 00:11:00,350
OK so then we can preview the link just by clicking on it and it looks like that.

182
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:00,930
Here we go.

183
00:11:00,950 --> 00:11:04,040
I mean that's exactly what I expected it to look like.

184
00:11:04,040 --> 00:11:06,150
This is moblie optimize it's very easy.

185
00:11:06,140 --> 00:11:09,960
Big open button someone can just click on it to figure out whatever they want to do.

186
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:15,050
So I could just click Bhag about innovation that should take them to Evon gmail dot com and there you

187
00:11:15,050 --> 00:11:15,290
go.

188
00:11:15,290 --> 00:11:16,410
That's my Web site.

189
00:11:16,430 --> 00:11:17,940
I don't use it all the time.

190
00:11:17,930 --> 00:11:19,400
If you notice it's not really updated.

191
00:11:19,490 --> 00:11:21,860
But if I was using it for whatever reason.

192
00:11:21,860 --> 00:11:26,700
There we go now I drove people directly to my blog and my blog is my main goal and perfect.

193
00:11:26,870 --> 00:11:27,430
Ok guys.

194
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:28,800
That's it for now.

195
00:11:28,820 --> 00:11:33,890
Next we'll do is we'll look into a landing page software and actually show you how to do it for FREE.

196
00:11:33,890 --> 00:11:38,930
Very quickly to make a landing page that might give you a little more control over whatever it is you're

197
00:11:38,930 --> 00:11:40,320
trying to drive leads to.

198
00:11:40,460 --> 00:11:40,720
OK.

199
00:11:40,760 --> 00:11:41,190
See you then.
