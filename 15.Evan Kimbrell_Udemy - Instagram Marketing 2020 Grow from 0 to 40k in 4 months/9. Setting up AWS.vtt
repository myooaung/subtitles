00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:01.830
Is welcome back.

2
00:00:01.880 --> 00:00:07.890
Kate lecture you we're going to do is we're going to set up a free A.W. as V.P. as OK.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:11.080
Now we're going to do this because well it's free.

4
00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.560
It's pretty easy to do.

5
00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:18.750
And in order to use Jarvi in a way that we don't have to have on a laptop or desktop computer on constantly

6
00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:20.670
we need to set up a VPN.

7
00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:25.380
And if you guys are interested in trialing out zombies as a strategy or you just want to save money

8
00:00:25.380 --> 00:00:27.920
for the first year this is a great way of doing it.

9
00:00:28.010 --> 00:00:28.250
OK.

10
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:34.780
So how do you do this as you go to AWOS Amazon Dot com slash free and you'll see a page like this.

11
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:41.560
There's a lot of our goal and jargon and gobbledygook so try not to get too distracted.

12
00:00:41.620 --> 00:00:45.080
So a lot of goofy terms when it comes to us especially at Amazon AWOS.

13
00:00:45.090 --> 00:00:49.460
But if you just follow my instructions it should be relatively simple to go to create a free account.

14
00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:55.300
OK then what it'll do is it'll ask you to set up an account if you have one you can earn.

15
00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.000
You can just sign into that.

16
00:00:57.210 --> 00:00:59.400
It's different than your regular Amazon one.

17
00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:00.480
Just keep that in mind.

18
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.580
So go ahead and pick an account name.

19
00:01:02.580 --> 00:01:04.910
Put in a password and it continue.

20
00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:09.240
Next up it'll ask you to give them some information about your account.

21
00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:10.310
This one's pretty simple.

22
00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.110
Just give them what they want.

23
00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:17.160
They will require a phone number so put a real phone number or you can use the burner system that we

24
00:01:17.160 --> 00:01:18.210
talked about before.

25
00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:24.510
So just put in your info please don't call me.

26
00:01:24.610 --> 00:01:24.900
All right.

27
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.210
Once you fill that out check the box make sure you agree go to create accounting continue.

28
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:33.130
OK next step what to do is it's going to ask for a credit card number and you do actually have to give

29
00:01:33.130 --> 00:01:37.230
it a credit card number unfortunately they don't charge you anything for the first year.

30
00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:41.980
I think they just do this to make sure that you're actually serious and they're not just you know letting

31
00:01:41.980 --> 00:01:47.140
a bunch of bots come on and just create tons and tons of free instances so give it what it wants and

32
00:01:47.140 --> 00:01:48.220
hit secure submit.

33
00:01:48.220 --> 00:01:50.300
Next step it is ask for phone verification.

34
00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:51.700
Sounds pretty simple.

35
00:01:51.730 --> 00:01:55.660
Give it your actual phone number or just said one of the burner phone numbers because what that'll do

36
00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:01.330
is we'll patched through and call you put in the catcha to show that you're not a robot.

37
00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:03.610
Next thing you do is just say call me now.

38
00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:08.520
And what that will do is a robot will call you and it's going to read you a pen code which you're going

39
00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:12.540
to have to enter in the next screen so make sure you have your phone handy dandy.

40
00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:14.090
All right click that.

41
00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:14.370
All right.

42
00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.950
So now I have somebody calling me.

43
00:02:17.970 --> 00:02:18.580
Let's see

44
00:02:22.830 --> 00:02:25.780
you.

45
00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:29.330
Please.

46
00:02:39.800 --> 00:02:41.490
Thank you.

47
00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.130
Thank you.

48
00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:47.870
Thank you.

49
00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.850
OK that was relatively simple.

50
00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:51.940
None of my identity has been verified successfully.

51
00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.170
I don't understand why that even counts as you're a danity being verified.

52
00:02:56.210 --> 00:02:57.480
Just a phone number.

53
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:00.260
Next up what we wanna do is it basic plan gives us the free one.

54
00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:03.820
Now if you guys obviously are familiar they tell us and you want to do a bigger one.

55
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:04.470
Go for it.

56
00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:06.650
But we're just going to cover the free plan for now.

57
00:03:06.650 --> 00:03:11.720
All right next up you'll see this screen and it gives you a bunch of 10 minute tutorials you can kind

58
00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.860
of ignore that stuff what you want to do here is sign into the con..

59
00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:20.130
Next up it'll ask for the e-mail address that you just used.

60
00:03:21.170 --> 00:03:21.990
Next.

61
00:03:22.530 --> 00:03:24.220
And your password.

62
00:03:24.220 --> 00:03:24.480
All right.

63
00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:26.640
Next up this is the screen we see.

64
00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.550
Keep in mind guys that the point at which I'm filming this.

65
00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:30.560
This is what it looks like.

66
00:03:30.570 --> 00:03:36.760
But they do have a tendency to change the user interface quite a bit with AWOS.

67
00:03:36.930 --> 00:03:39.670
It's always going to be the same buttons and the same features.

68
00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:41.570
It just might look slightly different.

69
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:46.650
It's always going to be this you always want to go and look for launch or virtual machine with E.C to

70
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:48.240
what is easy to.

71
00:03:48.420 --> 00:03:55.050
It's not really important but that's the type of service that a is offering us for free AWOS has a lot

72
00:03:55.050 --> 00:04:01.290
of different services for storing data or running applications doing a whole on virtualization stuff

73
00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:03.690
that's not terribly important for us.

74
00:04:03.690 --> 00:04:05.690
We just want to go launch our virtual machine.

75
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:10.990
Ok then we have a bunch of options for our Amazon machine image with the colon.

76
00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:15.720
I don't know why they need an abbreviation for that but what we want is we want to make sure that we

77
00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:23.210
get a 64 bit Windows account because all these other ones are nice but Java doesn't run on Linux.

78
00:04:23.220 --> 00:04:25.470
So that's something to keep in mind.

79
00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:33.760
So specifically we want to look for a server probably 2012 or 2016 are to base.

80
00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:40.160
So right here is the one that I know works for a fact and it says free tier eligible that's important.

81
00:04:40.230 --> 00:04:43.270
You could theoretically do it on the 2016 base.

82
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:44.620
That's fine.

83
00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:49.450
It's just the Darby's specifically tells us to use the tools and for whatever reason so hit select.

84
00:04:49.590 --> 00:04:54.420
All right so now we have a bunch of different setups that we could use.

85
00:04:54.420 --> 00:05:01.870
Now these are just ranges of how like how large of a resource base that you want to apply to your instance.

86
00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:03.840
None of this is really particularly important.

87
00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:08.250
We want the free one right so we just go to the old one that says free to you're eligible but good to

88
00:05:08.250 --> 00:05:11.130
know that these are the ones you can upgrade to relatively easily.

89
00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.760
So I'm going to review and launch.

90
00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:17.030
That it hits a screen or it says review insense launch.

91
00:05:17.060 --> 00:05:22.830
So give us some stuff like instance details none of this is terribly important.

92
00:05:22.830 --> 00:05:26.770
Right now we can always come back and get any of that information we want it to at launch.

93
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:32.160
OK so now what is going to do is it's going to ask us to set up what's called a key pair and that's

94
00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:35.060
just kind of like a funky way of setting up your password.

95
00:05:35.130 --> 00:05:39.780
They don't just give you a standard password they give you this file that you upload.

96
00:05:39.870 --> 00:05:42.800
That then allows you to create a password.

97
00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:46.270
It's just like one extra level of security.

98
00:05:46.470 --> 00:05:50.630
But I don't know I mean to some server companies actually do it this way.

99
00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:53.930
So I want to go to create a new key pair right here.

100
00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.710
And then you want to give it a name.

101
00:05:55.720 --> 00:06:01.770
Now the name I think is just so that you can find it on your desktop relatively easily so also easy

102
00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:08.040
to pass and I'll download my key pair.

103
00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:12.190
Now make sure that when you download this you don't lose it because later on when you try to really

104
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:13.990
log in you'll need this.

105
00:06:14.010 --> 00:06:15.510
And if you lost it.

106
00:06:15.510 --> 00:06:18.550
Death's problem you may have to recreate a new account.

107
00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:20.410
All right so I launched it.

108
00:06:20.490 --> 00:06:23.140
Now it says your indices are now launching.

109
00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:23.630
Great.

110
00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:26.600
OK then it gives you much information on how to connect to them.

111
00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:32.270
Now if you guys want to follow their advice and connect to their system their way that's perfectly fine

112
00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:34.380
is a lot different ways to connect to a VPN.

113
00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:37.140
It's really kind of comes down to personal preference.

114
00:06:37.140 --> 00:06:40.520
Also the way that I do it so just going to view instances.

115
00:06:40.620 --> 00:06:41.300
Hooray.

116
00:06:41.310 --> 00:06:43.340
OK so we have this one and it's running.

117
00:06:43.350 --> 00:06:44.490
So you get the green light.

118
00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:45.810
That's good.

119
00:06:45.810 --> 00:06:48.660
We have the public IP address right here.

120
00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:52.800
Now remember in the previous lecture I said it's really important that you make sure that you have access

121
00:06:52.800 --> 00:06:54.190
to your public IP.

122
00:06:54.390 --> 00:06:57.960
Otherwise your proxy IPs will have some problems authenticating.

123
00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.000
And that's just not good case.

124
00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:06.900
Now what I want to do is I want to go up here to connect it connect and then what it will do is it will

125
00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:10.170
give you the option to download what's called the remote desktop file.

126
00:07:10.170 --> 00:07:12.960
Now the extension is like T.A.R.P..

127
00:07:13.050 --> 00:07:19.080
What that is is just a file you can save on your desktop and then it allows you to pre fill in all the

128
00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:22.470
information when you want to log in to your VPN.

129
00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:30.090
So I'm using Microsoft remote desktop but application I can just open that file or import that file

130
00:07:30.510 --> 00:07:33.870
and it'll set up all of the information that I need.

131
00:07:33.870 --> 00:07:36.930
But if you remember from the last lecture it's not even hard.

132
00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:41.520
I mean you only put in the three points of information so I don't really even care that much about using

133
00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:42.060
this.

134
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.120
You want to use it.

135
00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:46.320
Ardy piece or you can definitely do it.

136
00:07:46.320 --> 00:07:48.210
But I think it's almost too simple.

137
00:07:48.210 --> 00:07:51.250
OK so let's go here to get password.

138
00:07:51.560 --> 00:07:51.980
OK.

139
00:07:51.990 --> 00:07:58.320
And then it will ask me for my pair path and that's basically hey where is that key that we just gave

140
00:07:58.320 --> 00:07:58.920
you.

141
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:00.840
So we want to go find it.

142
00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.610
So right here looks like a certificate.

143
00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:03.400
Kind of odd.

144
00:08:03.470 --> 00:08:04.780
OK great.

145
00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.380
Decrypt password and there you go.

146
00:08:07.380 --> 00:08:08.580
Now that's your password.

147
00:08:08.580 --> 00:08:12.110
Make sure copy that to your clipboard or even write it down if you can.

148
00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:13.610
And we're going to hit close.

149
00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:18.520
OK so at this point we have our password and it's something that we can type out on a keyboard.

150
00:08:18.570 --> 00:08:20.280
It's not some funky key anymore.

151
00:08:20.570 --> 00:08:22.130
Have our public IP address.

152
00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.780
And we also know what our username is and it's always administrator.

153
00:08:27.780 --> 00:08:33.000
So just kind of keep that in mind sometimes it's admin not administrator but that's pretty much it.

154
00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.380
All right so then what I suggest doing and it's completely up to you.

155
00:08:36.380 --> 00:08:39.660
There is a lot of ways you can do this is just to use Microsoft remote desktop.

156
00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:42.210
So this is what Microsoft's remote desktop looks like it's free.

157
00:08:42.210 --> 00:08:44.700
You just download it from Microsoft dot com.

158
00:08:44.730 --> 00:08:48.630
Usually I just Google it because it's not something that's easy to find.

159
00:08:48.630 --> 00:08:54.630
It's always almost always the first search if you just search for Microsoft remote desktop app and then

160
00:08:54.630 --> 00:09:00.810
you just it get and it'll determine what your operating system is and give you the right package once

161
00:09:00.810 --> 00:09:01.950
you install it.

162
00:09:02.010 --> 00:09:03.120
It takes two seconds.

163
00:09:03.120 --> 00:09:06.420
There's no there are any of any questions that give you.

164
00:09:06.690 --> 00:09:09.540
It should pop up and look like this.

165
00:09:09.540 --> 00:09:13.380
Very simple but also very easy to use.

166
00:09:13.380 --> 00:09:21.680
Now if you want to set up a new connection just go up here new We're going to name it for free.

167
00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:23.920
And PC name.

168
00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.290
OK.

169
00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.140
Well this is going to be the IP address that we had before.

170
00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:29.840
So copy that over

171
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:35.680
to the user name which is always an administrator

172
00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.220
then go to password and that's that password regenerated

173
00:09:44.030 --> 00:09:44.340
All right.

174
00:09:44.350 --> 00:09:47.290
Then you can exit out right there.

175
00:09:47.290 --> 00:09:49.080
We have AWOS for free.

176
00:09:49.090 --> 00:09:52.520
And then you just double click it if you open it.

177
00:09:52.690 --> 00:09:55.210
So you see this initialising negotiating potential's

178
00:09:58.560 --> 00:09:59.560
OK here we are.

179
00:09:59.570 --> 00:10:01.850
Now we say other user.

180
00:10:01.970 --> 00:10:02.460
OK.

181
00:10:02.490 --> 00:10:03.370
OK.

182
00:10:03.380 --> 00:10:05.300
Not sure why it says my username password is incorrect.

183
00:10:05.300 --> 00:10:06.690
Might of done something slightly wrong.

184
00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:11.360
Minister Raider type in the same password that you had before hopefully you wrote it down.

185
00:10:13.730 --> 00:10:19.460
Type it and and then wait for it to authenticate OK and there we go.

186
00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:23.820
Now we are in our Windows Server 2002 or two and the desktop looks like this.

187
00:10:23.840 --> 00:10:26.910
If you ran into something else then you did something wrong.

188
00:10:26.990 --> 00:10:32.120
Just as backing out and retrying it again but this is the Holy Land.

189
00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:36.470
This is really all we care about now really all you want to do is just go to Internet Explorer which

190
00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:37.550
should come with it.

191
00:10:37.580 --> 00:10:40.090
And then just make sure that you install Jarvi.

192
00:10:40.100 --> 00:10:51.910
So Cisco here go to Jarvi dot net you may have to add a bunch of trusted sites to your Internet Explore

193
00:10:52.120 --> 00:10:55.630
one of the joys I guess of Internet Explorer is they don't trust anyone.

194
00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:01.600
So trying to protect you from viruses presumably but it just looks like this.

195
00:11:01.810 --> 00:11:05.760
And you can just download it by creating an account.

196
00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:07.770
Actually you can start a free trial if you want.

197
00:11:07.870 --> 00:11:11.590
OK then you can just go over to the starter package and start your free trial.

198
00:11:11.590 --> 00:11:12.710
I believe their free trial.

199
00:11:12.710 --> 00:11:16.300
So make sure it's only like four days or something.

200
00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:17.920
But that's really the best you can do.

201
00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:19.330
OK I think it's five days.

202
00:11:19.330 --> 00:11:21.040
They fluctuate depending on it.

203
00:11:21.130 --> 00:11:27.170
OK so it's set up so luckily they don't take a credit card from us so just give me your email address.

204
00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:28.400
Start for the trial.

205
00:11:28.570 --> 00:11:34.090
OK then you get this and what it'll do is it'll say you know welcome to Jarvi.

206
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:37.180
It will give you your username and or automatically give you password.

207
00:11:37.180 --> 00:11:39.960
Make sure that you copy that password write it down somewhere.

208
00:11:40.090 --> 00:11:43.390
You should have some text right here that says download the installer if they've changed the screen

209
00:11:43.390 --> 00:11:44.650
at some point.

210
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.790
Well it could just be somewhere else like over here at Download Jarvi it's usually the easiest thing

211
00:11:48.790 --> 00:11:49.590
to find.

212
00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:51.190
So we go to that.

213
00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:56.890
Yes click through all of the obnoxious security settings on your Internet Explorer and it should start

214
00:11:56.890 --> 00:12:02.320
the download so we can do a direct download Google Drive PC blah blah blah.

215
00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:08.230
So if you are running into security issues when you click direct downloads you might prefer just clicking

216
00:12:08.230 --> 00:12:13.630
the Google Drive download because it takes you to this page and then you can download it from Google

217
00:12:13.630 --> 00:12:14.300
Drive.

218
00:12:14.350 --> 00:12:19.990
OK so if you guys are still having issues and you try to download it will give you a prompt saying hey

219
00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:21.920
you can't download this.

220
00:12:22.030 --> 00:12:28.000
What you have to do is you have to go to your control panel so you get to the bottom here the start

221
00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:29.280
button go to Control Panel.

222
00:12:29.320 --> 00:12:30.660
You should see the screen.

223
00:12:30.700 --> 00:12:36.060
So go to network and Internet go to Internet options specifically right there.

224
00:12:36.070 --> 00:12:43.770
And then you get this pop up that looks like it's from Windows 95 and then go to security right here.

225
00:12:43.780 --> 00:12:50.590
So what you have to do is go to this screen go to custom level and then you should scroll through all

226
00:12:50.590 --> 00:12:51.960
of this junk.

227
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:59.500
You should find something that says download files so it says downloads file download disable and click

228
00:12:59.590 --> 00:13:00.320
Enable.

229
00:13:00.370 --> 00:13:02.830
OK sure you want change settings zone.

230
00:13:02.830 --> 00:13:05.370
Yes change saying zone it apply.

231
00:13:05.410 --> 00:13:08.550
Now go back and it should let you download.

232
00:13:09.140 --> 00:13:09.570
OK.

233
00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:13.940
Save and then wait for it to download.

234
00:13:14.090 --> 00:13:17.270
OK hit the downloads right there.

235
00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.450
No hit run.

236
00:13:18.550 --> 00:13:21.580
Now you'll go through the install system.

237
00:13:21.590 --> 00:13:25.990
So pretty simple make sure that you agree to the license agreement.

238
00:13:25.990 --> 00:13:30.120
Next next next next next install your system might be pretty slow.

239
00:13:30.130 --> 00:13:32.720
So keep in mind all this is a small package.

240
00:13:32.950 --> 00:13:34.710
It might take awhile to install OK.

241
00:13:34.750 --> 00:13:35.460
Once it's done.

242
00:13:35.470 --> 00:13:37.420
It'll say launch Jarvi hit finish.

243
00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:41.420
OK you should have two shortcuts on the desktop.

244
00:13:41.450 --> 00:13:43.660
I don't know why but Jarvi is right here.

245
00:13:43.660 --> 00:13:48.920
And then just log in with the username and password you set up for OK.

246
00:13:48.930 --> 00:13:53.450
Now remember your password was a very special code that Jarvi gave you.

247
00:13:53.460 --> 00:13:58.840
So go back to the Derby application and then enter in your password that you got before.

248
00:13:58.950 --> 00:14:02.400
OK once you log in this is what it looks like.

249
00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:07.950
At first you will have nothing the first message you get is just Jarvi is now active which is good which

250
00:14:07.950 --> 00:14:14.010
means that we are ready to set up Jarvi with the account so we've already created in the previous lectures.

251
00:14:14.010 --> 00:14:19.470
So coming up what we'll do is we'll spend a couple lectures looking at Jervy because there's a lot to

252
00:14:19.470 --> 00:14:20.110
it.

253
00:14:20.850 --> 00:14:26.880
And I'll explain to you the sections that we care about and what settings seem to work at the moment

254
00:14:26.990 --> 00:14:32.370
and kind of what areas should focus on tweaking in order to grow your zombie strategy.

255
00:14:32.460 --> 00:14:32.870
OK.

256
00:14:32.940 --> 00:14:33.570
Scenics lecture.
