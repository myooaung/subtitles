1
00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,830
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:07,160
So this lecture are going to do is we're going to start the process of finding someone who can do automatic

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:08,920
outreach for us.

4
00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:11,630
Now in this picture we're going into two different things.

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:16,600
One we're going to create a job post posted on freelancer dot com.

6
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:21,720
And then the second thing is we're going to set up an automatic Google sheet and set up the framework

7
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:23,970
for which they can start gathering information.

8
00:00:23,970 --> 00:00:29,040
Now if you have already taken my advice from the previous sections where we talk about scaling your

9
00:00:29,040 --> 00:00:35,880
content and you have someone who could do this for you already then that's fantastic.

10
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,430
But I'd still like to show you how if you're going to hire specifically for this this is how you would

11
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:41,920
do it.

12
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:42,180
OK.

13
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:47,130
So the first thing I want to do is set up the receptacle for where this supposed person is going to

14
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:47,970
gather information.

15
00:00:47,970 --> 00:00:49,550
So I like to use Google sheets.

16
00:00:49,560 --> 00:00:50,460
You can use Excel.

17
00:00:50,490 --> 00:00:51,660
You can use whatever you want.

18
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:58,710
Honestly as long as it has basic sharing on it and you can share it with someone and you can revoke

19
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:00,750
their access to it as well.

20
00:01:00,750 --> 00:01:01,670
Should anything go wrong.

21
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:04,560
So I'm just going to go to Google sheets and create a new sheet.

22
00:01:04,560 --> 00:01:08,640
All right what I want to do is just call this out for show outreach.

23
00:01:09,030 --> 00:01:09,460
OK.

24
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:15,470
And then what I need to do is just kind of set up the parameters for how they're going to collect information.

25
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:21,900
So when we think about who it is that we would potentially do a collaborative post with what do we care

26
00:01:21,900 --> 00:01:22,570
about.

27
00:01:22,620 --> 00:01:28,140
Well we're probably going to care about what their name is what their audience is what the size of their

28
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:29,230
account is.

29
00:01:29,270 --> 00:01:33,960
We're also going to want to track whether or not we've contacted them and whether or not they've responded

30
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:36,830
so pretty simply we could just say.

31
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,350
So let's say the account name.

32
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:47,790
So that's their name on Instagram and then we're probably going to want a guess as to like the category

33
00:01:47,790 --> 00:01:48,750
that they're in.

34
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:56,290
And then we'll probably want to know how many followers they have followers.

35
00:01:57,480 --> 00:01:59,040
And then pass that it's pretty simple.

36
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,190
So let's just say contacted.

37
00:02:01,260 --> 00:02:06,080
So that'll be a yes or no call on then we'll just say responded.

38
00:02:06,570 --> 00:02:12,550
And that's a yes or no again and then whether or not the promotion was run.

39
00:02:12,570 --> 00:02:12,870
OK.

40
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:18,540
So here's way to basically work is I just want to gather the name of the account what category there

41
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,560
and just to make sure that we're getting the right people then how many followers they have.

42
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,450
The time that they were gathered then I want to make sure that we track whether or not we've contacted

43
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:30,770
them whether or not they've responded and then whether or not the promotion was run.

44
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:32,460
That is really pretty much it.

45
00:02:32,460 --> 00:02:37,860
Now we have collected all the information we find relevant should we go down this process and actually

46
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:43,830
start running this pretty competitively we might add other things as we figure out oh okay it's also

47
00:02:43,830 --> 00:02:49,530
pretty important that they have a video already or maybe the response time is important.

48
00:02:49,530 --> 00:02:52,840
There's a lot of other factors we can't always think of at the very beginning.

49
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:58,340
So let's just make this so it's not a blight on the eyes OK.

50
00:02:58,600 --> 00:03:01,000
And that is pretty much it.

51
00:03:01,150 --> 00:03:01,430
All right.

52
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:08,620
So now in order to find someone this is one of these tasks should be as if you're watching my outsourcing

53
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:10,170
course as we go away and adapt to this.

54
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:12,460
But I kind of summarize this very quickly.

55
00:03:12,670 --> 00:03:17,680
The complexity of the task you're asking them to do is going to be the largest factor in how much you

56
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:18,790
have to pay them.

57
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,950
If it's really really simple that means you can write out very simply what they have to do in order

58
00:03:23,950 --> 00:03:30,190
to do it correctly and then it doesn't really matter who you hire where they're from how well they speak

59
00:03:30,220 --> 00:03:32,130
English etc. etc..

60
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:38,170
With that being said there are generally speaking two major platforms for hiring freelancers or virtual

61
00:03:38,170 --> 00:03:38,800
assistants.

62
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,850
I know there's a bunch of other ones like people who are our guru and like virtual systems dot com.

63
00:03:43,960 --> 00:03:47,860
But in terms of size you can't really compare them to up work and freelancer.

64
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:52,600
Now if you remember talking about upwards of works great for finding a variety of different people all

65
00:03:52,600 --> 00:03:58,360
over the world for a variety of different tasks or as freelancers great for finding people who are really

66
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:01,080
cheap who can do very basic simple tasks.

67
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,740
So that being said that's going to be the platform that we're going to try to use.

68
00:04:05,740 --> 00:04:11,740
So just go to freelancer dot com looks like this works basically the same way as up work.

69
00:04:11,740 --> 00:04:13,870
I mean we just create job posts.

70
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,430
You add in basic payment information and then you post it you can post for free on this one.

71
00:04:19,570 --> 00:04:26,080
And for the most part yeah the community really kind of revolves around simple basic low pay tasks.

72
00:04:26,110 --> 00:04:29,980
Just keep that in mind that's not to say that you can't find great people doing things like building

73
00:04:29,980 --> 00:04:34,160
entire web site but I'm just saying that their community kind of skews in this direction.

74
00:04:34,210 --> 00:04:34,630
So good.

75
00:04:34,630 --> 00:04:35,560
Create an account.

76
00:04:35,650 --> 00:04:38,650
Once you create an account it should take you to a page like this.

77
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:40,720
It's not hard to set this up.

78
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:44,700
They don't even require a credit card from you up front or anything like that.

79
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:50,200
I've used this before so you can kind of see like I've used them for personal assistance and basic data

80
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:50,610
entry.

81
00:04:50,620 --> 00:04:55,840
That's kind of the sweet spot I've found for freelancer now posting a project I really simple can't

82
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:58,000
miss it right here is that poster project.

83
00:04:58,000 --> 00:04:58,260
All right.

84
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:02,270
Now like up Orrick we have choose a name for our project or to tell more about a project and upload

85
00:05:02,530 --> 00:05:05,830
information that we think is relevant now.

86
00:05:05,950 --> 00:05:10,660
In order to do this well I think that we should make sure that we hit the same basic tenants that we

87
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:13,380
talked about before for job posts.

88
00:05:13,420 --> 00:05:17,510
So I like to do just as it is to open up a word document.

89
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:22,990
So either Microsoft or Evernote bear test scathed whatever it is you use is it really matter.

90
00:05:23,050 --> 00:05:25,650
And then just kind of scratch our notes in here.

91
00:05:25,660 --> 00:05:29,830
Now this one is not going to be particularly hard because we're just looking for someone who can follow

92
00:05:29,830 --> 00:05:34,120
directions very basically and that's it really.

93
00:05:34,120 --> 00:05:39,280
So we don't need to get too fancy with this and it don't even have to think too hard about the title

94
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:42,880
we give because it doesn't really matter if we get 200 people applying versus 50.

95
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:44,450
You only need one person.

96
00:05:44,590 --> 00:05:48,100
So give a basic description of the job up front.

97
00:05:48,290 --> 00:06:06,970
I need someone to compile Instagram accounts that meet this current Syria and then to message them on

98
00:06:08,250 --> 00:06:10,480
through my account.

99
00:06:11,170 --> 00:06:13,150
OK so that's the basics of it.

100
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:21,250
And then what I like to do is give a little context as to why I'm looking for Instagram accounts that

101
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:28,140
are similar to the account I'm currently growing.

102
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:30,730
And I'll give them a link to it because they want to see that

103
00:06:36,920 --> 00:06:52,560
and say I want to reach out to a lot of other counts to see if we can promote each others accounts.

104
00:06:53,110 --> 00:06:53,820
OK.

105
00:06:54,010 --> 00:06:58,570
So that pretty much explains what it is you don't need to go into absolute detail as to why or why you

106
00:06:58,570 --> 00:07:02,180
think it's effective at all while in early care they're just here to complete a task.

107
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:05,740
OK I don't know what I want to do is probably give a little bit of the how right I've done the what

108
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:06,770
the why.

109
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:19,910
Now any idea of the how so how I'll say my account uses new technology and innovations.

110
00:07:20,790 --> 00:07:34,760
I need to find all accounts that appeal to a smaller audience.

111
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:45,100
Accounts must be in one of these categories and then list out technology

112
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,000
gadgets.

113
00:07:50,210 --> 00:08:00,740
Luxury like tronics and I can even say things like start ups because those are you know decently related.

114
00:08:00,740 --> 00:08:05,420
So then we can even do things like science that's often a common overlap.

115
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:22,470
Science is like then I can give an example things like hearing Mr. X X are viral videos.

116
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,730
You can then focus on electronics and I think that's a pretty good list.

117
00:08:27,740 --> 00:08:29,690
I can always go back and edit this.

118
00:08:29,870 --> 00:08:32,320
Once they get started especially once they start running out of accounts.

119
00:08:32,330 --> 00:08:36,980
But they should be able to find thousands and thousands accounts with these criteria.

120
00:08:36,980 --> 00:08:41,630
Now then I need to give them more criteria as to what specifically they're looking for.

121
00:08:41,630 --> 00:08:47,720
So all say accounts must be let's see.

122
00:08:47,780 --> 00:08:50,370
So we might say our accounts at 27 thousand.

123
00:08:50,370 --> 00:09:03,590
So I would say over 15000 followers and under because I don't want to waste time to say 75000 followers

124
00:09:03,830 --> 00:09:11,180
just because I think a 75000 person follower might be inclined to work with me reading over that they're

125
00:09:11,180 --> 00:09:12,620
kind of just wasting their time.

126
00:09:12,620 --> 00:09:15,050
Now it's up to you whether or not you want to give them further criteria.

127
00:09:15,050 --> 00:09:18,630
I could say something like only accounts with a certain engagement rate.

128
00:09:18,630 --> 00:09:23,720
Right because it maybe you don't want to promote two accounts that have low engagement rates which would

129
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,210
so leave my audience.

130
00:09:25,220 --> 00:09:30,550
I might also say I only want to count that primarily have an audience from United States.

131
00:09:30,620 --> 00:09:34,240
OK now that's up to you whether or not you want to get that detail but you just have to keep in mind

132
00:09:34,520 --> 00:09:39,620
this becomes a little bit more complicated and you have to have some way of showing them how to figure

133
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:40,010
this out.

134
00:09:40,010 --> 00:09:40,460
Right.

135
00:09:40,460 --> 00:09:42,380
We use hype auditor but it's not realistic.

136
00:09:42,380 --> 00:09:46,610
If they do this for hundreds of accounts that'll get expensive to figuring out who their audience is

137
00:09:46,610 --> 00:09:47,680
their engagement rate.

138
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:51,530
You know the free tool they can use and there are some free tools and that might be something we're

139
00:09:51,530 --> 00:09:52,250
showing.

140
00:09:52,250 --> 00:09:56,810
But for me I would rather catch that later on in the process.

141
00:09:56,810 --> 00:10:02,870
I'd rather cast a wider net to say anybody who meets these basic criteria and then once they start messaging

142
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:10,580
them they'll respond and then it's up to me to start the actual process with them by negotiating how

143
00:10:10,580 --> 00:10:16,430
we're going to share our promotion or what videos I need or when we're going to do it because it's very

144
00:10:16,430 --> 00:10:21,770
easy for me to then look at the person's account and go oh I don't actually like that account and mine's

145
00:10:21,770 --> 00:10:27,350
me motivational relational entrepreneurship.

146
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,440
So that reminds me I'll add a couple more I dare just because those accounts are very used to doing

147
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,630
share for shares so likelihood of getting yeses from are much higher.

148
00:10:37,790 --> 00:10:39,950
OK then now that I've done the how.

149
00:10:39,950 --> 00:10:44,600
Now I just need to move off into any other information that I need to state.

150
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:49,580
Like for instance when they need to do this what their goals are what I expect from them so I might

151
00:10:49,580 --> 00:11:03,410
say I need someone who can spend say an hour a day doing this until it's no longer needed and then I

152
00:11:03,410 --> 00:11:12,980
might give some parameters like prefer people in North American time zones just because that's going

153
00:11:12,980 --> 00:11:18,350
to be a lot more useful especially if I'm trying to inadvertently target people who are in the north

154
00:11:18,350 --> 00:11:23,660
american time zones that might be useful just because I don't want to be in a situation where every

155
00:11:23,660 --> 00:11:27,470
time I give them new instructions it takes them 12 hours to implement it because they're asleep.

156
00:11:27,500 --> 00:11:28,440
So I might say that.

157
00:11:28,490 --> 00:11:28,970
OK.

158
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:32,090
Now the last thing I might do is just ask for a trial.

159
00:11:32,090 --> 00:11:47,930
So in order to do this job this job please message me and your message with two accounts you have found

160
00:11:48,590 --> 00:11:54,940
Instagram sickroom that meet these requirements.

161
00:11:55,250 --> 00:11:55,760
OK.

162
00:11:55,910 --> 00:12:01,580
Now trials are incredibly effective with freelancer you're going to get a ton of people messaging you

163
00:12:01,580 --> 00:12:08,420
because there's a ton of people with very high skill sets that are not very distinguished from each

164
00:12:08,420 --> 00:12:08,940
other.

165
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:10,640
It's very much a low end.

166
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:15,200
Work doesn't require a lot of thought just because someone with a good Internet connection who can follow

167
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,530
rules and does basic internet research.

168
00:12:17,720 --> 00:12:22,910
So I'm going to say this and to be honest probably 10 percent of the people who are smart will even

169
00:12:22,910 --> 00:12:27,120
do this and then one out of 10 percent maybe five percent get it right.

170
00:12:27,140 --> 00:12:32,250
But remember you're going to like 50 applications maybe even 100 if you leave this up long enough.

171
00:12:32,270 --> 00:12:37,880
So I want to make sure that we have our get is competent enough to read all of the instructions and

172
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,490
then basically carry out a very simple task.

173
00:12:41,570 --> 00:12:46,850
We should take them two minutes never wanted a really really narrow this down to someone who really

174
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:47,410
really wanted it.

175
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:49,000
I could say Give me five accounts.

176
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:49,740
OK.

177
00:12:49,850 --> 00:12:53,300
You might run into the problem where a lot of people won't do it because they think like oh you're just

178
00:12:53,300 --> 00:12:57,060
trying to collect accounts for free by having us all do this.

179
00:12:57,140 --> 00:13:03,110
And of course that's kind of stupid because why would you have 100 different people give you two accounts

180
00:13:03,470 --> 00:13:07,460
because then you have to go and search through every single one to verify that it was even correct to

181
00:13:07,460 --> 00:13:08,680
begin with.

182
00:13:08,780 --> 00:13:11,620
And that's the same amount of time it would take you to just do it yourself.

183
00:13:11,630 --> 00:13:13,890
But these people don't really think about it that way.

184
00:13:13,910 --> 00:13:17,300
They're only thinking from the narrow scope from which they're applying to their job.

185
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:20,960
They don't know how your system works so it's I guess somewhat understandable.

186
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:26,960
OK so that's pretty much it up to you if you want to add other things other requirements you might say

187
00:13:26,960 --> 00:13:32,240
like we'll communicate through Skype because the freelancer messenger system is not great.

188
00:13:32,280 --> 00:13:35,090
But I mean you can also just use it.

189
00:13:35,240 --> 00:13:41,270
You could say that you want them to update you after every fifty that they add or something like that

190
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:42,650
whatever it is.

191
00:13:42,650 --> 00:13:45,490
You might even go into a little bit more about what they're going to do.

192
00:13:45,500 --> 00:14:00,280
So I might say I'll give you access to a Google feed and I want you I want you to fill it out and message

193
00:14:01,280 --> 00:14:09,290
after we you know say 50 accounts have been added.

194
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:12,000
Now I'm thinking about doing this in two different phases.

195
00:14:12,030 --> 00:14:18,200
One they can pilot and two they start reaching out in mass and that makes probably more sense.

196
00:14:18,210 --> 00:14:19,250
But I could do it either way.

197
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,840
Keep in mind even though this is a human doing it you still could get in trouble with sending too many

198
00:14:24,840 --> 00:14:29,130
messages too quickly so keep that in mind that SCRAM doesn't like that behavior because they think it

199
00:14:29,160 --> 00:14:30,190
looks like a bot.

200
00:14:30,430 --> 00:14:34,580
And yeah I mean from their perspective it might be hard to tell a difference.

201
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:41,590
OK so let's post that and then in the next lecture we'll catch up and see who has applied to our gig.

202
00:14:41,750 --> 00:14:41,950
OK.

203
00:14:41,970 --> 00:14:44,300
So choosing names your project doesn't really matter.

204
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:46,330
Just say what it is.

205
00:14:46,380 --> 00:14:52,950
Compile Instagram accounts and send templated message.

206
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:54,570
I'm going to give them a template message.

207
00:14:54,570 --> 00:14:56,910
We'll talk about the next lecture for them to send.

208
00:14:56,910 --> 00:15:00,640
It's going to be very very basic because of my experience.

209
00:15:00,670 --> 00:15:03,630
So I mean once you are shout out you don't need to convince them of a whole lot.

210
00:15:03,660 --> 00:15:08,010
Then we can copy and paste this description.

211
00:15:08,100 --> 00:15:10,290
Make sure the formatting didn't come on all funky.

212
00:15:10,290 --> 00:15:12,790
Did it go great.

213
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,160
OK.

214
00:15:14,640 --> 00:15:15,910
And there we go.

215
00:15:15,910 --> 00:15:17,310
Then what next.

216
00:15:17,310 --> 00:15:19,640
Then what skills are you interested in.

217
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,970
For this kind of thing it's just data entry data entry.

218
00:15:22,980 --> 00:15:25,800
You might say internet research.

219
00:15:25,860 --> 00:15:28,340
So that's a pretty common one.

220
00:15:28,500 --> 00:15:35,040
You might say excel means people are used to using Excel or as Google sheets kind of same thing and

221
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,830
then I might say Instagram although this is going to dip into a different pile of people.

222
00:15:40,830 --> 00:15:44,430
So ideally if someone's already familiar with that scream there you know how to find people.

223
00:15:44,450 --> 00:15:45,260
And that's great.

224
00:15:45,270 --> 00:15:50,070
And hey if they want to use a tool that they've used that's perfectly fine as long as the results match

225
00:15:50,070 --> 00:15:53,930
what I told them to look for guys I don't want to pay or to pay by the hour.

226
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,350
Now you could do fixed price if you want to but we're doing this as an automation system.

227
00:15:58,350 --> 00:16:03,050
I want them to continuously do this so I can keep this going.

228
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:05,040
Now if I just wanted to try it out I could do.

229
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,660
Pay fixed price and say I need 100 accounts and you get a message 100 accounts.

230
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,890
Once they're done it's over.

231
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:13,500
Then is I ask you for your estimated budget you don't need to pay that.

232
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:17,000
I mean that's this is about as simple as it gets so I usually go with basics.

233
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,900
Hit next.

234
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:18,150
OK.

235
00:16:18,170 --> 00:16:22,560
They don't sell you on something that's not useful and not something I'd recommend at all.

236
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,790
That's great if you're trying to do like a big project maybe but for the most part for 10 bucks you

237
00:16:26,790 --> 00:16:28,840
don't get a whole lot of help from them.

238
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,960
OK great so now postman project.

239
00:16:30,960 --> 00:16:32,430
All right now that it's posted.

240
00:16:32,580 --> 00:16:37,080
I will get back to you in the next lecture and we'll start looking over the people that did.

241
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:37,730
All right see you then.
