00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:01.660
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:08.370
OK so I have not checked in in like three or four days mainly because I just got sick and I came out

3
00:00:08.390 --> 00:00:11.310
the cold while I'm traveling.

4
00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:18.300
I'm currently in Sarajevo in Bosnia and pretty bad timing to get a nasty cold they might actually be

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:20.070
allergies so again I apologize.

6
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.660
Pretty raspy voice.

7
00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:25.670
And here is an update you guys on what's happened since I last checked in.

8
00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:26.590
Not a whole lot.

9
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:30.800
Again because I was sick so I didn't really get to put a lot of time into this.

10
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:36.090
Also I'm on vacation so I'm not putting a ton of time into this part of the point was I want to show

11
00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:40.330
you that you can do this by only participating 20 minutes 30 minutes a day.

12
00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.210
That's really all I spend some days I don't even touch it.

13
00:00:43.560 --> 00:00:45.030
But anyway.

14
00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:53.220
So first off I have continued to explore pay promotions and they kind of are all over the board.

15
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:54.780
Some of them work really well.

16
00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:57.410
Some of them don't work really well.

17
00:00:57.420 --> 00:01:06.300
I made one mistake which I immediately kind of kicked myself over which was I was working with a bunch

18
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:12.650
of people doing really cheap paid promotions because I'm trying to get to that 5000 mark.

19
00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:19.290
But what happened was once someone saw that I was doing paid promotions on one side they started reaching

20
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:22.340
out to me saying hey I have promotions on these other sites.

21
00:01:22.530 --> 00:01:27.750
Now when people do this to you it's perfectly fine it's just that you need to make sure to do your diligence

22
00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:28.160
on them.

23
00:01:28.170 --> 00:01:32.040
And even though they're really really cheap you still need to do that.

24
00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:40.290
So what happened was this person came and said you know I'll do a story and a post for $10.

25
00:01:40.290 --> 00:01:40.700
Right.

26
00:01:40.710 --> 00:01:43.080
And that's pretty ridiculously cheap.

27
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:49.970
And their account size city was 59000 so I was like OK sure why not.

28
00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:51.830
So I did it but I didn't really check.

29
00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:52.230
OK.

30
00:01:52.230 --> 00:01:59.220
And so one did up kind of happening was I gave them that standard fake video image that says Like who

31
00:01:59.220 --> 00:02:02.250
wouldn't want to have three robotic arms or whatever.

32
00:02:02.250 --> 00:02:07.230
And then I gave them the standard story promotion that we've been using.

33
00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:12.500
What ended up happening is I didn't run the hype auditor on them.

34
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:12.720
Right.

35
00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:19.730
And so what I did notice something and that was their target market was not mine.

36
00:02:19.820 --> 00:02:20.330
OK.

37
00:02:20.340 --> 00:02:22.300
And it actually damaged my score.

38
00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:25.890
So their rating is 60 65 which is perfectly fine.

39
00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:26.840
But here's the difference.

40
00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.750
Twenty three percent of their followers are from India.

41
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:33.660
Six have Brazil Indonesia or five U.S. only four.

42
00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:39.740
No I'm not saying that you don't want to target people from India Brazil or Indonesia.

43
00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:43.570
It's just that you need to tell beforehand who you are targeting that was not my target market.

44
00:02:43.590 --> 00:02:50.280
I was going after U.S. Canada and people specifically in this time zone and really want them to be spread

45
00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.430
out over multiple times.

46
00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:59.190
And I also was the idea was that eventually I was going to flip this account or do an affiliate relationship

47
00:02:59.220 --> 00:03:04.320
and the affiliate idea that was talked about later was kind of a high ticket item.

48
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:11.910
And so India in Indonesia and Brazil lower purchasing power so I'd also not probably inclined to buy

49
00:03:11.910 --> 00:03:14.880
something online that's really expensive.

50
00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.110
So that was probably not a great match.

51
00:03:17.110 --> 00:03:21.660
You know there's plenty of stuff you can sell to these markets you kind of have to be aware of what

52
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:23.790
the local demand is.

53
00:03:23.970 --> 00:03:25.870
So anyway I didn't notice this.

54
00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:33.870
And so what end up happening is if you look at my account I actually ended up adopting a lot of Indian

55
00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.080
users.

56
00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.290
So right here you can see this one's kind of crowing right there.

57
00:03:39.290 --> 00:03:43.130
So you'll get a table almost 16 percent.

58
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:50.100
India and Indonesia is 5 percent and originally for this my number two was like Canada or the U.K. or

59
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.890
something like that.

60
00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:52.440
So what.

61
00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:56.600
So just as a reminder make sure that you check that your target markets are the same.

62
00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:00.470
I did get the male the female skew that was just lucky though.

63
00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:00.890
OK.

64
00:04:00.900 --> 00:04:05.520
So you kind of generally see the last like like three days since I checked in.

65
00:04:05.520 --> 00:04:06.980
Growth has slowed.

66
00:04:06.990 --> 00:04:15.650
So we're only doing 70 a day from that day and then let's see it one 30 million between this and that

67
00:04:15.650 --> 00:04:15.990
one.

68
00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:16.840
This is today.

69
00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.110
That's not data yet.

70
00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:24.120
You can tell it kind of aren't like that now now what's happening is that a lot of the techniques we're

71
00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:28.410
using before are just kind of starting to run out of traction.

72
00:04:28.410 --> 00:04:34.080
So one of the hashtags we're using we've just kind of hit them so many times that they're not going

73
00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:36.100
to be as effective going forward.

74
00:04:36.180 --> 00:04:41.360
Usually expect these happen this happen later on but not really surprised.

75
00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.140
And then also the paid promotion.

76
00:04:43.140 --> 00:04:48.720
So like for instance if we look at the account called brilliant inventions and I ended up working out

77
00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.360
a deal with them directly because when I originally did their promotion it worked really well with that

78
00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:54.780
huge spike right.

79
00:04:54.780 --> 00:04:57.490
There was of a thousand.

80
00:04:57.660 --> 00:05:02.400
Now I thought it was mostly coming them because when I was watching it it looked like it mostly was

81
00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:03.470
coming from them.

82
00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:11.830
So I negotiated a deal with them to do a post and to give me a cheaper price because it was direct and

83
00:05:11.830 --> 00:05:12.920
then they even wanted to do.

84
00:05:12.920 --> 00:05:17.330
Look at $300 five stories five post thing and at first I was like kind of.

85
00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:18.200
I thought that would work.

86
00:05:18.210 --> 00:05:23.790
But then I decided well why don't we just test it out and so today we posted another post very similar

87
00:05:23.790 --> 00:05:25.250
to what worked before.

88
00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.240
And it's just not performing right.

89
00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:32.220
So I did the same like fake video thing where it says you know future robots go to the innovation station

90
00:05:32.220 --> 00:05:39.500
to see the full video it does have you know 1300 likes but it's just not really converting very much.

91
00:05:39.720 --> 00:05:41.520
So I haven't really seen much of an uptick.

92
00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:43.830
Not nearly as much as like when I saw it before.

93
00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:50.520
So that might just be because I'm kind of overdoing it or I can't do the same thing back to back I need

94
00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:52.100
to try something else.

95
00:05:52.180 --> 00:05:53.080
So yeah.

96
00:05:53.100 --> 00:05:56.670
Anyway that's kind of worth keeping in mind.

97
00:05:56.670 --> 00:05:58.460
You know I did this also.

98
00:05:58.460 --> 00:06:03.800
So I would like philosophy of science we didn't want them that so I did the same thing sit there and

99
00:06:03.840 --> 00:06:06.040
leave it up permanently which is fine.

100
00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:08.550
And I said a crowdsource analyst good elevation station and video.

101
00:06:08.550 --> 00:06:13.110
Now this account was all about science that's all I care about.

102
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.580
If you look at everything on here it's all science and space was the other one.

103
00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:23.850
People really seem to like space stuff like Carl Sagan quotes and this guy Neil deGrasse Tyson things

104
00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:32.970
like that so I what I did as I fast tracked a post in my account that was base related and that I got

105
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.650
it posted so that I could use it to see right here and then.

106
00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:47.390
So what I was doing as I was marking them for fast tracks so I used yellow as a marker for fasttrack

107
00:06:47.430 --> 00:06:50.120
So that was a 13 foot tall robot.

108
00:06:50.130 --> 00:06:55.720
I wanted to use that as something I'll explain in a second what I see.

109
00:06:55.740 --> 00:06:59.340
So like this one was for instance one that I was going to use with them because it's indoor farm grows

110
00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:00.570
produce in aerospace.

111
00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:03.450
Okay so that was space related.

112
00:07:03.450 --> 00:07:09.240
I kind of had to go and like dig to find space related ones but that's just generally what you have

113
00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:10.280
to do.

114
00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:13.660
Anyways this one didn't perform that well either.

115
00:07:14.030 --> 00:07:15.810
I don't know what it is.

116
00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:21.460
You see earth orbiting satellite.

117
00:07:21.480 --> 00:07:23.130
This might have been it.

118
00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.060
Yeah this is.

119
00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:24.800
OK.

120
00:07:25.080 --> 00:07:27.090
So I fast tracked this one.

121
00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:29.340
It looks like someone removed the tag after it was done.

122
00:07:29.340 --> 00:07:32.250
But anyway so that's what I did and I did a bunch of other ones.

123
00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:37.950
I don't know where we were at when I last checked and so and so when I'm realizing yes the paper motions

124
00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:41.120
are kind of slowing down a little bit so I need to probably switch up my strategies a little bit.

125
00:07:41.130 --> 00:07:46.200
Now one other thing I thought was kind of interesting was one of the people that I worked with before

126
00:07:46.470 --> 00:07:50.300
and you saw this is actually way back in the paid promotion section and I talked about it it was Grainne

127
00:07:50.310 --> 00:07:56.680
attack and they had a good audience score like a really good hive auditors score.

128
00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:59.260
And they had a very related audience.

129
00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:04.280
And so what I did was I did a promotion with them and it worked pretty well.

130
00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.370
I was pretty happy with it.

131
00:08:06.570 --> 00:08:13.140
But then what they said is hey they had a proposal for me and they said if I paid ten bucks they would

132
00:08:13.140 --> 00:08:16.050
do what's called like it's kind of like a promotion ring.

133
00:08:16.050 --> 00:08:20.950
So they said is instead of you putting them on our profile and then our audience watching them you click

134
00:08:21.030 --> 00:08:24.240
on your profile and then we'll drive a lot of traffic to it.

135
00:08:24.310 --> 00:08:27.360
Now there's a lot of question marks as to how exactly they do this.

136
00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:31.560
But basically the way it works is there's a lot of people out there who own multiple accounts like Grand

137
00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:34.570
Attack on something like that they told me one point fifteen.

138
00:08:34.770 --> 00:08:43.770
And so they did 15 accounts with what they basically do is post your post or at least a link directly

139
00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:44.210
to it.

140
00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:46.070
And a shout out from all 15.

141
00:08:46.070 --> 00:08:46.830
All at once.

142
00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:49.830
And so the idea is that they do it all at once.

143
00:08:49.830 --> 00:08:55.530
They might be able to get you onto the explore page of this one the explore page like this.

144
00:08:55.530 --> 00:08:58.680
And then all of a sudden you a lot of exposure to other people.

145
00:08:58.680 --> 00:08:59.270
OK.

146
00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:06.940
So that's what we are calling for and I hope hand $10 is like again for $10 I'll do anything and I really

147
00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:07.840
care.

148
00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:14.490
And so we picked something that hadn't I thought had mass appeal and it was goofy like robot this one

149
00:09:14.570 --> 00:09:15.480
OK.

150
00:09:15.510 --> 00:09:17.060
And so what ended up happening.

151
00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.580
You can look here if you notice something.

152
00:09:18.600 --> 00:09:21.660
Oh my gosh look at 200 4000 views.

153
00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:29.220
So they really jacked up the exposure of this one post for $10 which kind of incredible.

154
00:09:29.460 --> 00:09:35.860
If you look at let's see if you go to my engagement because a massive spike right there look at ceiling

155
00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.630
likes history.

156
00:09:36.670 --> 00:09:37.370
Look at that.

157
00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:38.800
And then the robot post.

158
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:47.010
So it was 20 100 likes which is just not remotely like anything else I've done so you know engage in

159
00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.660
it was close to 800.

160
00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:55.360
My impressions are 64000 right now look at let's look at the one before the cruise ship.

161
00:09:55.830 --> 00:09:56.660
Yeah.

162
00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:57.270
Not even close.

163
00:09:57.290 --> 00:09:59.810
300 OK so that was kind of interesting.

164
00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:01.450
I just to see why not.

165
00:10:01.550 --> 00:10:04.750
You know and it just it really did go nuts.

166
00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:07.570
Only 12 comments but that's not really a big surprise.

167
00:10:07.590 --> 00:10:09.620
So I did that just to see how it work.

168
00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:12.020
Did I get a lot of followers from it.

169
00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:14.290
That's kind of hard to say.

170
00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:16.490
I didn't really notice a huge jump.

171
00:10:16.490 --> 00:10:19.070
So you see it's on the fourth.

172
00:10:19.140 --> 00:10:22.990
So if we were to look at our community and look and see what happened on the fourth.

173
00:10:23.130 --> 00:10:23.520
Yeah.

174
00:10:23.550 --> 00:10:26.940
So it looks like it's close to 300.

175
00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:29.820
So I guess that's you know better than my usual days.

176
00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:35.620
But it wasn't really enough to justify paying for one singular post that way.

177
00:10:35.620 --> 00:10:39.630
You know I might do it again just because it's kind of interesting you see one downside obviously is

178
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:45.900
that it kind of skews your metrics again so I can if I could indeed read and see what's my most popular

179
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.850
posts will do.

180
00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:49.640
It's going to be the one that DECT that on.

181
00:10:49.650 --> 00:10:53.370
Obviously you got promoted that doesn't mean it's the most popular one it just got a lot traffic driven

182
00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:58.560
to it because of the other two things we started doing was we started doing stories and were going to

183
00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:00.030
do stories around 5000.

184
00:11:00.040 --> 00:11:01.860
But what happens when you guys are listening to this.

185
00:11:01.860 --> 00:11:05.080
But just recently Instagram changed the kind of rules with this.

186
00:11:05.100 --> 00:11:09.960
So with most stories you need to swipe up things you swipe up and then it can take you to a link and

187
00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:15.340
that's incredibly useful because otherwise you really do can just say you can give them a call action

188
00:11:15.350 --> 00:11:19.830
that they don't have to literally go to your account or go to the search bar and search for your account

189
00:11:19.830 --> 00:11:20.720
to go to it.

190
00:11:20.730 --> 00:11:24.700
Now the rule is that you can only do that 10000.

191
00:11:24.750 --> 00:11:28.350
So you kind of limit the effectiveness of our stories.

192
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:33.750
So I'm thinking about delaying my like doing stories consistently.

193
00:11:33.900 --> 00:11:40.230
But regardless we've put together stories and we have the basic format and we've changed enough of the

194
00:11:40.230 --> 00:11:43.290
process to accommodate.

195
00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:48.930
So what ended up happening was we made it such that we have a screen that opens it says top innovations

196
00:11:48.930 --> 00:11:55.380
of the day and then because each story is only 15 seconds we can only pick one caption out of the five

197
00:11:55.380 --> 00:12:00.110
to eight in each video and then we play those basically in a line.

198
00:12:00.110 --> 00:12:06.540
Now to make this make any sense be couldn't just grab a random caption from each video because it doesn't

199
00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:08.600
necessarily fit.

200
00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:14.150
So we have to go back and rewrite them so there are simpler and more succinct and then that.

201
00:12:14.340 --> 00:12:19.450
The image behind it made sense as a standalone So let's watch all of our stores contaminations that

202
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:20.310
they may test.

203
00:12:20.580 --> 00:12:21.060
Cool.

204
00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:21.980
And there goes the next one.

205
00:12:21.980 --> 00:12:22.730
So had change.

206
00:12:22.750 --> 00:12:26.340
So it says a new pair of Ogmund really glasses Brink's training.

207
00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:31.830
And your video is in the future texture.

208
00:12:31.950 --> 00:12:32.500
Great.

209
00:12:32.570 --> 00:12:32.870
OK.

210
00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.140
So we had to do that one and then this is this was the glass one we just watched right like we had to

211
00:12:37.140 --> 00:12:41.980
rewrite this and find a clip that works so I can click through these and watch them.

212
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:45.720
And then the last thing is the full video that envisions Isha and you know whatever.

213
00:12:45.870 --> 00:12:50.810
Originally we had a swipe up but we can't do that for at least another 6000 followers.

214
00:12:50.850 --> 00:12:56.290
So yeah doing that and for the most part we're looking at some of the stats and it's working out fine.

215
00:12:56.300 --> 00:12:57.540
I'm looking at the stats.

216
00:12:57.650 --> 00:13:06.120
If I look at my story stats we can see that for the most part people will so also a star stories 1744

217
00:13:06.150 --> 00:13:08.780
people started and 69 ended.

218
00:13:08.790 --> 00:13:13.620
Now we don't really have anything to benchmark this against but I'd say that's pretty good.

219
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:19.620
I'd say that's in front of 400 people if they walk all the way through and probably get a good like

220
00:13:19.620 --> 00:13:21.720
200 people back to my profile.

221
00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.790
That might explain some of the liking and some of the some of the tagging and commenting that we're

222
00:13:26.790 --> 00:13:28.080
getting now.

223
00:13:28.120 --> 00:13:29.460
There are only two stories every single day.

224
00:13:29.460 --> 00:13:35.730
I'm not really sure really it's just a change in the process so what I've done is I had to get the caption

225
00:13:35.730 --> 00:13:41.180
ners to change up the way that they were doing captions.

226
00:13:41.250 --> 00:13:44.040
So originally they were doing you know five to eight.

227
00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:47.510
Now what they're doing these five day plus.

228
00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:53.730
They were adding in one man and trying to find where there's so many cards that basically left a message

229
00:13:53.730 --> 00:13:59.640
saying OK can you guys also do one summary sentence and that summary sentence is what we then put in

230
00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:05.540
the caption and then does the editors also know that they need to pick one clip that's seven to eight

231
00:14:05.550 --> 00:14:09.670
seconds that's could stand alone on itself.

232
00:14:09.750 --> 00:14:14.850
And then once they did that I kind of wait a couple of days for it to make it through the pipeline because

233
00:14:14.850 --> 00:14:18.180
you guys remember like my lead time was like six days or something.

234
00:14:18.180 --> 00:14:22.840
So I didn't really start seeing any of these new ones released two or three days.

235
00:14:23.010 --> 00:14:26.970
So now we're actually to the point where we can do this if we want to know whether or not I'm going

236
00:14:26.970 --> 00:14:28.620
to I'm not really sure if it's worth it.

237
00:14:28.710 --> 00:14:30.870
Probably in a way to have more people.

238
00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:36.710
The only other thing was certain my first zombie and you guys don't know how that works.

239
00:14:36.710 --> 00:14:40.460
Or then you skip the section on zombies and you go back and watch that because I actually explain it

240
00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.850
in my view.

241
00:14:41.970 --> 00:14:46.380
This is the first one I'm kind of doing this to toy around with the settings to see how it's working

242
00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:49.710
because Instagram's recently changed a lot of the rules.

243
00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:57.150
So I really got to like tip my toe in the water and see how well you know the same strategy works.

244
00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.560
So we have this one right here.

245
00:14:58.620 --> 00:14:59.680
Oh my innovation.

246
00:15:00.150 --> 00:15:07.190
And what it is I started this one I used a very similar design for the account.

247
00:15:07.830 --> 00:15:13.020
So I just use one of the alternate colors there is and.

248
00:15:13.050 --> 00:15:13.530
OK.

249
00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:18.780
And I will all I've been doing has just been posting quotes and then I got followers just so it wouldn't

250
00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:20.250
look like it was empty.

251
00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:22.590
And then I've been running actions on it.

252
00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:25.390
And for the most part it has been running fine.

253
00:15:25.410 --> 00:15:28.180
As you can see there's some activity going on.

254
00:15:28.650 --> 00:15:33.590
I've been just taking quotes and setting them into a folder on my vba is right there.

255
00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:40.230
And then what it's happening is it's feeding from this that's just pulling these out and then I have

256
00:15:40.230 --> 00:15:41.880
it set to basically loop.

257
00:15:41.880 --> 00:15:45.610
Now I haven't yet set up the reposed part but what I'm going to do is have it.

258
00:15:45.730 --> 00:15:51.150
Repos from accounts that have images and also fit my general kind of area.

259
00:15:51.150 --> 00:15:55.260
Now I'm going to screw around at this one probably a week or more before I decide to create more.

260
00:15:55.380 --> 00:15:58.140
And once I create a replicating system.

261
00:15:58.290 --> 00:16:00.750
But for the most part this is kind of what it looks like.

262
00:16:01.020 --> 00:16:07.110
Just posting quotes because it's not really practical to do a video with Zombi because you can't automatically

263
00:16:07.110 --> 00:16:07.910
post videos.

264
00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.350
You'd have to have someone get in and do this over and over and over again and constantly change their

265
00:16:13.380 --> 00:16:18.540
IP and do all that stuff and that's just also dangerous because he's spurning IP across accounts.

266
00:16:18.550 --> 00:16:20.190
And that's just a nightmare.

267
00:16:20.190 --> 00:16:27.270
So we're just trying to figure out ways of doing images only if he knows that each one has its own hash

268
00:16:27.270 --> 00:16:32.670
tags and it always says like follow an evasion station and an investigation has the tags on it.

269
00:16:32.670 --> 00:16:33.930
So anyway.

270
00:16:33.990 --> 00:16:35.190
So this is one of them.

271
00:16:35.190 --> 00:16:39.330
This only works in volume so I'm just trying to figure out the first one before I start really kind

272
00:16:39.330 --> 00:16:45.320
of picking this off in the next video or two you'll start seeing this strategy as it starts to expand

273
00:16:45.550 --> 00:16:46.030
again.

274
00:16:46.050 --> 00:16:52.290
Once we get to 5000 or start doing shout shouts and so you get to 10000 will definitely ramp up stories.

275
00:16:52.310 --> 00:16:54.790
Meantime I'm not sure if I'll do stories every single day.

276
00:16:55.050 --> 00:16:55.390
OK.

277
00:16:55.440 --> 00:16:57.690
So that is good for now.

278
00:16:57.690 --> 00:16:58.910
See you guys next Jack in.
