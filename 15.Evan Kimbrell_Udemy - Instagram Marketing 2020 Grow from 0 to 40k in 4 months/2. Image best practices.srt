Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,710 --> 00:00:04,480
Let's chat about the best practices when we make images.
2

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,150
Hopefully, the creation process is pretty straightforward.
3

4
00:00:07,230 --> 00:00:08,630
We have templates and tools.
4

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,520
We know the composition patterns that most people
use, and, guess what, it really is not that hard.
5

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,080
If you're shooting your own photos, then
6

7
00:00:16,110 --> 00:00:18,120
OK, that's a little bit harder.
7

8
00:00:18,150 --> 00:00:21,450
OK, first thing, do you know what the rule of thirds is?
8

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:21,990
OK.
9

10
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:23,310
The rule of thirds applies to images or movies,
10

11
00:00:23,310 --> 00:00:25,080
The rule of thirds applies to images or movies,
11

12
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:27,570
basically everything all the time,
12

13
00:00:27,570 --> 00:00:32,430
and it focuses on where in the photo you should
have your subject, or let's just say the points
13

14
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:38,880
of interest, at. If you were to divide a photo into three
columns and three rows, and then look at it, it
14

15
00:00:38,880 --> 00:00:44,160
would look like a grid system, would look like this. For
whatever reason, human potato brains and eyeballs like to
15

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,610
always see things aligned with the guidelines in
the photo, meaning in a position that intersects with
16

17
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:58,110
one of these lines. Images with compositions that are slightly askew like this for whatever reason just look more natural to us.
17

18
00:00:58,110 --> 00:01:00,000
one of these lines. Images with compositions that are slightly askew like this for whatever reason just look more natural to us.
18

19
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:01,560
Now, why is that?
19

20
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:03,620
It's not really worth getting into.
20

21
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:08,630
It has something to do with your brain and how it
processes information and matches it to your vision.
21

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,860
So if you have something of interest, whether it's an
illustration, or a person, or a funny looking flower,
22

23
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,750
place the things you're supposed to be
focused on on one of those third lines.
23

24
00:01:18,750 --> 00:01:22,650
So, let's say you're taking a shot of a person,
put them slightly to the left or the right.
24

25
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:27,600
If you're shooting a landscape, put the horizon
slightly above or below the middle of the photo.
25

26
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,770
I don't know, it's basically black magic, and if you ask
me to go into more depth in the questions, I'll
26

27
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:33,680
probably lose it and delete the course.
27

28
00:01:33,690 --> 00:01:37,930
The next tip is to always add your logo
or at the very least a watermark.
28

29
00:01:38,010 --> 00:01:41,630
The logo will reinforce your branding,
make your account more memorable,
29

30
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,410
make it look like you're standing by your content,
which implies that your stuff is probably better than
30

31
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:48,030
the average junk in your feed,
31

32
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:50,190
and so people can't just steal your work.
32

33
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:52,510
Or, let's say, easily steal your work.
33

34
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:57,890
You can put it in the bottom corner if you want,
or directly below, or just central aligned
34

35
00:01:57,900 --> 00:02:01,220
with the bottom of the photo.
These are the most common spots.
35

36
00:02:01,230 --> 00:02:04,710
Usually, it's best if you use the same spot,
but I realize sometimes that's hard.
36

37
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,440
That's perfectly fine. If you want to add a watermark,
37

38
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:29,340
it's really quite simple.
38

39
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:34,240
Alright, guys, got it? Pretty easy to do and will
make you look quite a bit more professional.
39

40
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,820
Now, the next tip is to always, always,
always use high resolution anything.
40

41
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,180
Low resolution photos or even medium resolution
photos just do not work on Instagram.
41

42
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:50,210
It's the most obnoxious faux pas or mistake accounts
can make, it just turns people off, it looks awful. So if
42

43
00:02:50,210 --> 00:02:53,850
you have an image and you love it, but it's not very large,
43

44
00:02:53,850 --> 00:02:55,250
then just give it up.
44

45
00:02:55,310 --> 00:02:56,290
Drop the bone.
45

46
00:02:56,290 --> 00:02:57,320
It's not going to work.
46

47
00:02:57,320 --> 00:03:01,940
Last thing I'll say, and I'm not sure how
necessary this is to say even, but here goes.
47

48
00:03:02,150 --> 00:03:03,870
People hate stock photos.
48

49
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,570
I don't know if I've said this already,
but I especially hate them.
49

50
00:03:07,700 --> 00:03:08,620
They're stuffy.
50

51
00:03:08,620 --> 00:03:09,560
They're fake.
51

52
00:03:09,560 --> 00:03:13,970
Unless you're posting them specifically
as a joke, it's not really going to work.
52

53
00:03:14,050 --> 00:03:17,710
And this is why we have things called unstock
photos and why they are so important.
53

54
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:23,810
A stock photo is a perfectly population representative
multicultural group standing in a nameless boardroom
54

55
00:03:23,810 --> 00:03:29,210
grinning at each other like they just heard a joke that was
kind of funny but they also secretly detest each other
55

56
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:29,630
grinning at each other like they just heard a joke that was
kind of funny but they also secretly detest each other
56

57
00:03:29,630 --> 00:03:35,310
underneath the surface. Unstock photos look more
like someone took a shot of an actual setting
57

58
00:03:35,450 --> 00:03:40,180
while the subject wasn't paying attention - you know,
stuff that actually looks like photographs.
58

59
00:03:40,190 --> 00:03:40,640
Got it?
59

60
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:42,040
OK, rule of thirds.
60

61
00:03:42,050 --> 00:03:47,150
Put things of visual interest on one of those intersecting
lines as if you were to divide the photo into thirds.
61

62
00:03:47,150 --> 00:03:47,920
Put things of visual interest on one of those intersecting
lines as if you were to divide the photo into thirds.
62

63
00:03:47,930 --> 00:03:52,710
Put your logo or at least a watermark on it to prevent
people from stealing it and make it look better.
63

64
00:03:52,730 --> 00:03:57,980
Always use high resolution photos, and please, for
the love of God, please stop using istockphoto.com.
