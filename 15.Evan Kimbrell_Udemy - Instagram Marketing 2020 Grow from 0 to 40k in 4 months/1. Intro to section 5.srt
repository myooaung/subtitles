Hey dudes, what's up?

00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:02,480
Welcome back.

3
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:04,830
Welcome to Section 5, technically 6 on Udemy, I don't
know. Last section was a doozy, but guess what?

Welcome to Section 5, technically 6 on Udemy, I don't
know. Last section was a doozy, but guess what?
4

5
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:09,930
We made it.
5

6
00:00:09,930 --> 00:00:14,370
Now you should have the knowledge and tools to make some actual posts and to get the ball moving on your account.

Now you should have the knowledge and tools to make some actual posts and to get the ball moving on your account.
7

8
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:18,990
Remember, we just want to get the first 10
posts before we move on to promotions.

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:26,300
So, by the time you finish this section, you should be
at that, give or take a couple content pieces. In this
9

10
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,130
section, we're talking about posting.
10

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:29,100
How do you do it?
11

12
00:00:29,100 --> 00:00:30,860
What do you need to optimize?
12

13
00:00:30,850 --> 00:00:37,440
Why are hashtags everywhere, including my dreams, and
how do I get people to respond to my post? We'll cover
13

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,920
captions, call to action lines, and how
to not use emojis like a circus clown.
14

15
00:00:41,950 --> 00:00:43,390
We'll also cover things like
15

16
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,350
when is the best time to post and
how can I get more comments?
16

17
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,350
Since we're diving into a new section of the app itself,
the next lecture is going to introduce you to
17

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:55,130
the part of the app we're now going to be playing in.
18

19
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:58,550
If you've already posted before,
then guess what I'm about to say?
19

20
00:00:58,630 --> 00:01:01,800
Skip the lecture, because I don't want to hear you complain.
20

21
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:02,610
Ready? K bye.
21

22
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:03,130
Ready? K bye.
