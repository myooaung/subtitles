00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.560
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:06.930
So this lecture we're going to do is we're going to walk through the parts of the app that are relevant

3
00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:08.150
to what we're doing in the section.

4
00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:09.720
And those are three different sections.

5
00:00:09.720 --> 00:00:16.320
One is the explore page two is the search section and then three we're going to look at other people's

6
00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.380
accounts what features they have and what are some of the tools on their pages that we can use for our

7
00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:23.040
purposes.

8
00:00:23.040 --> 00:00:28.410
Now you've heard me say this a million times but if you are not new to Instagram this is going to bore

9
00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:29.460
you to tears.

10
00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:29.900
Sure.

11
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:36.120
We're going to talk about how some of the smaller features or little bits might help you and you might

12
00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.800
not have realized that but you don't have to watch the entire lecture because this is for people who

13
00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:45.690
are pretty much brand new to this and want me to kind of walk them through and get them acquainted with

14
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:46.360
the app.

15
00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:52.640
All right so with that being said let's pull up Instagram on both US and on our Android.

16
00:00:52.670 --> 00:00:56.970
OK so on both apps it looks pretty much like this when you go to the homescreen.

17
00:00:57.020 --> 00:01:00.690
We've already covered the homescreen and that feeds that we don't really care about that where we first

18
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:06.930
care about is the explore page and the way you get to the explore page is by hitting this search glass

19
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:12.960
like Spotlight glass and I know you call that Tony because I'm actually logged into the same account

20
00:01:12.960 --> 00:01:18.000
on both of these phones that they show me different things so I don't know why that is occasionally

21
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:21.580
you'll notice there are differences between Android and iOS.

22
00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:23.490
I couldn't begin to explain why.

23
00:01:23.490 --> 00:01:26.090
So this is the Explorer page Explorer page.

24
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:28.260
It's kind of broken into three sections of the top.

25
00:01:28.260 --> 00:01:36.750
We have a custom feed that says for you and then we have other little themes that you can select up

26
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.530
here at the top that will change all of the suggested videos below.

27
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:45.960
If you click on them so if I was only interested in food it would give me this custom Explorer page

28
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.290
of food.

29
00:01:47.280 --> 00:01:51.550
OK and if I said for you that kind of takes me back to that first screen I saw.

30
00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:59.880
Now if you look down here it's it's kind of a collage of images videos and then also sprits in Instagram

31
00:01:59.880 --> 00:02:02.630
live videos and TV.

32
00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:07.770
So as I'm recording this TV is relatively new and that's why they're trying to push people really hard

33
00:02:07.770 --> 00:02:08.860
to check it out.

34
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:14.100
It's always at the top right corner as I'm seeing and right now I guarantee you when you watch this

35
00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:19.290
it's probably change the explore page is one of the sections that Instagram changes more often than

36
00:02:19.290 --> 00:02:20.160
any other section.

37
00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.440
So keep that in mind.

38
00:02:21.570 --> 00:02:23.400
It doesn't really matter.

39
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:26.730
Honestly we don't even use this very often.

40
00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:31.440
I think the only time we'll use the explore page is if for instance we're looking at competitors or

41
00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:33.700
people we want to network with in our space.

42
00:02:33.750 --> 00:02:38.520
We'll start following them and then naturally they'll start popping up on our explore page.

43
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:43.380
Now these videos you see here are based on a number of things that's based on what they think your interests

44
00:02:43.410 --> 00:02:44.430
are.

45
00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:48.830
It's based off of who is popular and then it's based off of who you follow.

46
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:52.150
So of all your followers the most popular posts those will pop up.

47
00:02:52.150 --> 00:02:57.720
You also see things from celebrities and people have multi million dollar accounts so those get showed

48
00:02:57.720 --> 00:02:58.920
pretty much everywhere.

49
00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:01.350
Once you get to the point we have a really really large account.

50
00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:06.570
You can actually start getting placement on anyone's Explorer feed even if they're not following you

51
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.840
and that's just another inflection point in your growth.

52
00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:12.520
But that's going to take a long time for you ever get there.

53
00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:17.550
But what this is useful for is when you're following people in your space you can very easily come here

54
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:20.420
and find posts that are worth posting.

55
00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:23.090
Now this is obviously the section or really care about that.

56
00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:28.830
But later on we'll talk about reposting and doing shout outs and it's a really good idea to keep tabs

57
00:03:28.830 --> 00:03:30.000
on other people in your space.

58
00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.520
What are they posting that performs really well and what might fit well with your audience specifically.

59
00:03:35.640 --> 00:03:38.160
Later on we'll get to a point where we don't have to make our own content.

60
00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:43.890
We can repost other people's stuff and it's a great way of setting up a reciprocal relationship between

61
00:03:43.890 --> 00:03:44.820
you and that account.

62
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.650
But then also you know your audience likes to see new stuff.

63
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.480
So yeah that's pretty much the extent of the explore page and what we care about.

64
00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.550
Now if you go up this search right here what's going to happen is it's going to give you top people

65
00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.750
tags and places.

66
00:03:57.750 --> 00:04:02.730
Now what's gonna happen on top is it's just going to give you a suggested list of accounts based on

67
00:04:02.730 --> 00:04:07.960
what you've searched before or the theme of your account or what you're interested in.

68
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:13.140
It gives you the suggested accounts and that is a pretty useful way as a consumer to find accounts that

69
00:04:13.140 --> 00:04:13.920
might interest you.

70
00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:18.450
This sometimes helps us in the sense that if we're trying to find a bunch of accounts that might be

71
00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.560
in our space it'll give us some suggestions and sometimes that can save you some work and then both

72
00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:29.040
That just shows recent searches you've made and that's really only useful to go back and find somebody

73
00:04:29.040 --> 00:04:30.220
you've searched for in the past.

74
00:04:30.220 --> 00:04:37.440
Now if I got to people is going to tell us basically the same thing as opposed to top shows us the suggested

75
00:04:37.650 --> 00:04:40.280
hashtags locations and accounts.

76
00:04:40.380 --> 00:04:42.070
People is just going to show us people.

77
00:04:42.090 --> 00:04:42.830
OK.

78
00:04:42.870 --> 00:04:47.000
You notice right here when you have these rings around the logo see it round.

79
00:04:47.010 --> 00:04:50.020
Pfizer actually if I press that it'll take me to their story.

80
00:04:50.030 --> 00:04:54.780
Now just a quick and easy way to access their stories to see what the accounts about without having

81
00:04:54.810 --> 00:04:56.620
to actually jump into their page.

82
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:57.700
Then if you go to tags.

83
00:04:57.720 --> 00:05:01.790
Don't be too confused by what tags are tag our hashtags.

84
00:05:01.850 --> 00:05:03.510
So these are the top hashtags.

85
00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:04.100
OK.

86
00:05:04.190 --> 00:05:10.340
Now you'll notice if we go up to the top and search for something so if I said let's you know this is

87
00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:14.900
something that's relevant to my account let's say innovation and Android will say technology she'll

88
00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:20.330
notice on top it'll show us you know feet of the top accounts hashtags and places that are related to

89
00:05:20.330 --> 00:05:27.050
that term I put in to get people to show me the top accounts that are based on that term and top is

90
00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.730
just generated by.

91
00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.950
Usually it's the number of followers and the engagement rate they have and then also I think it's a

92
00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.670
basic kind of suggestion tool for is it related to your account.

93
00:05:37.670 --> 00:05:42.260
So sometimes a bump them up if it's more related to your account like for instance I said innovation.

94
00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:46.180
And then we go to tech formation and tech formation that doesn't innovate.

95
00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:51.140
It only has it in its subtitle but I think it bumped it up because it knows in the past I've interacted

96
00:05:51.140 --> 00:05:52.460
with this account.

97
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:58.640
Now if you go to tag's it'll show me the top tax and it'll show me pretty much immediately how many

98
00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.480
posts they have.

99
00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:05.360
And then in some cases it'll say if one of your followers follows that hashtag I personally hate that

100
00:06:05.360 --> 00:06:06.170
that's super annoying.

101
00:06:06.170 --> 00:06:11.300
I don't know how many people follow technology but instead I know that John Kerry has followed this

102
00:06:11.330 --> 00:06:11.680
great.

103
00:06:11.690 --> 00:06:13.220
That's not useful for me.

104
00:06:13.310 --> 00:06:15.410
But you can click through and then see.

105
00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:15.800
Yeah.

106
00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:17.180
$7.9.

107
00:06:17.420 --> 00:06:22.940
OK so when you go to the hash tag pages you find hash tags is a very very useful way to not only find

108
00:06:22.940 --> 00:06:27.450
accounts to interact with but also to find people to reach out to.

109
00:06:27.470 --> 00:06:31.430
Also it's a great way of figuring out who is posting in your space and who was popular the popular ones

110
00:06:31.430 --> 00:06:35.660
are going to be showing up higher on these pages so we'll just go through what the screen looks like.

111
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:36.860
Really quickly.

112
00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:43.190
So we have right here with the red circle around the image that is going to be all of the top stories

113
00:06:43.250 --> 00:06:44.240
for this hashtag.

114
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:50.560
So if you looked at technology it's going to be a smorgasbord of anybody who posted with this hash tag

115
00:06:50.570 --> 00:06:56.550
either on their story or just their account and it's going to basically rank them based on popularity.

116
00:06:56.630 --> 00:06:59.240
Then I can follow these hashtags if I want.

117
00:06:59.450 --> 00:07:02.940
If I had the downward arrow I can see suggested similar hashtags.

118
00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:08.150
That's incredibly useful not only for hash tag research but for finding more people in your space.

119
00:07:08.150 --> 00:07:12.820
Now we're going on here we have the section which is broken down into essentially two different sections

120
00:07:12.830 --> 00:07:14.090
one we have related.

121
00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:17.680
So that's going to tell us coheres related hashtags that are similar.

122
00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:22.180
You know some of these aren't really that similar like unbox therapy.

123
00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.630
I mean that's not it's popular for unbox therapy type videos that use technology that's not all they

124
00:07:26.630 --> 00:07:32.900
do but it's a great way to kind of figure out some other places you can bumble around and gather data

125
00:07:32.900 --> 00:07:33.350
on.

126
00:07:33.390 --> 00:07:41.180
Then down here we have posts and there are Ogleby videos or lives or even just images and they're gonna

127
00:07:41.180 --> 00:07:42.830
be divided by top and recent.

128
00:07:42.830 --> 00:07:43.440
OK.

129
00:07:43.550 --> 00:07:45.210
Now when do we get into the hash tag section.

130
00:07:45.230 --> 00:07:50.120
We'll talk about the difference between these two whenever you post something and your Tatchell with

131
00:07:50.120 --> 00:07:52.460
a hash tag it's automatically going to show up in recent.

132
00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:58.280
But you'll notice very quickly socially large hashtags that refresh this page see in the last one and

133
00:07:58.280 --> 00:08:02.360
a half seconds I already had two more posts that have technology as its hash tag.

134
00:08:02.510 --> 00:08:10.010
So you don't get a lot of attention on this list and so the goal is essentially to pick hash tags you

135
00:08:10.030 --> 00:08:15.190
think give a good chance of getting to the top because top ones don't want to refresh this.

136
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:17.550
It doesn't automatically change everything.

137
00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.390
Kind of the same this doesn't change as much.

138
00:08:20.390 --> 00:08:21.800
It's also the first screen that people see.

139
00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:23.090
So that's kind of a big deal.

140
00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:25.820
All right so that's pretty much what the hash tag pages look like.

141
00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:32.240
So if we exit out we'll go to the places tag and the places tag is pretty much the same thing that the

142
00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:32.750
pages are.

143
00:08:32.750 --> 00:08:33.890
So let's look at London.

144
00:08:34.220 --> 00:08:41.210
And over here we'll look at New York it works pretty much the same thing it just has a little map feature

145
00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:46.640
and then also we have top stories from the area which personally I think are fascinating sometimes.

146
00:08:46.790 --> 00:08:49.920
And then we have the top and recent posts.

147
00:08:49.940 --> 00:08:56.930
If you are using location tags This is another way of checking this space so if for instance your account

148
00:08:56.960 --> 00:09:01.460
was a like a local business this could be very useful to find other accounts that post in this area

149
00:09:01.970 --> 00:09:07.520
typically because they are also either in that area or they're doing something that's topical with that

150
00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:08.630
space.

151
00:09:08.630 --> 00:09:13.030
Either way it's also a great way to find people who follow these hashtags.

152
00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:18.710
So if I were to click through to someone's account in this space then I can see that hey this person

153
00:09:18.710 --> 00:09:20.410
might actually follow this hashtag.

154
00:09:20.450 --> 00:09:23.520
OK so there is the search functions.

155
00:09:23.570 --> 00:09:26.910
The last thing I want to show you is we just want to dive into someone else's account.

156
00:09:26.930 --> 00:09:33.020
And so you can see very quickly what that looks like so let's go to Samsung planet over here and we'll

157
00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:36.260
get to this 3-D printing and technology person over here.

158
00:09:36.350 --> 00:09:36.670
OK.

159
00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:41.360
So this is what the other person's account looks like and I'm sure you've seen this if you spent any

160
00:09:41.360 --> 00:09:43.070
time on Instagram.

161
00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:44.950
Up at the top we see the total post.

162
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:45.980
We have total followers.

163
00:09:46.010 --> 00:09:47.780
Then we have how many people they are following.

164
00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:54.020
And we have their descriptions their captions their not their user names of their regular names their

165
00:09:54.020 --> 00:10:01.340
categories even if they're categorized into a category we have calls to action we have any story highlights

166
00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:04.150
that they've made or even IGY TV if they do that.

167
00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:06.500
And then down here we have their actual post.

168
00:10:06.530 --> 00:10:11.770
Now you can obviously click through to their actual posts and this is a great way of figuring out OK

169
00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:14.900
if my account is about let's say technology over here on Samsung.

170
00:10:15.050 --> 00:10:19.790
They can very easily look and see who is commenting on this and this gives me a great way of seeing

171
00:10:20.210 --> 00:10:24.650
these people are engaged with technology accounts it's very easy to find that I can also just look at

172
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:28.520
their likes by clicking on their likes and I can see OK these are people that I might want to target

173
00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:34.130
with my post by tagging them or following them or shouting out to them or anything like that.

174
00:10:34.190 --> 00:10:38.830
Now if you go back you can click on their followers right here and I'll give you a list of their followers

175
00:10:38.840 --> 00:10:41.760
and this is honestly a great way to get people's attention.

176
00:10:41.840 --> 00:10:45.650
And you already know that they're interested in this account and probably interested in the theme of

177
00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:50.930
the account so I could just go down here and click follow a bunch of times and that's a great way of

178
00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:52.300
actually getting attention now.

179
00:10:52.370 --> 00:10:56.810
Keep in mind you obviously want to do this in a smart way and we'll cover this later on when you get

180
00:10:56.810 --> 00:10:59.620
into growth schedules and growth habits.

181
00:10:59.620 --> 00:11:04.250
It's a great way of getting followers but you have to kind of pace yourself and be smart about it.

182
00:11:04.250 --> 00:11:08.480
Now there's two more things though I'll show you and that is if you follow someone you follow then all

183
00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.670
of a sudden you should be able to message them.

184
00:11:10.670 --> 00:11:14.420
Now I can actually follow them because I've hit my limit for followers for the day.

185
00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:18.610
But typically you notice it flashes when I hit follow a message for a second.

186
00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.800
That's usually what it says.

187
00:11:19.970 --> 00:11:23.120
And then you can actually message someone and that's a great way of reaching out to them.

188
00:11:23.120 --> 00:11:24.970
You have to follow them first though.

189
00:11:24.970 --> 00:11:28.860
They're leaving on a show you this is down arrow and it works the same way as the other down arrows.

190
00:11:28.860 --> 00:11:31.430
We were looking at it will show you suggested accounts.

191
00:11:31.430 --> 00:11:36.230
Now this is what you would think a very small feature but this is incredibly useful.

192
00:11:36.230 --> 00:11:36.470
Right.

193
00:11:36.470 --> 00:11:41.600
Like if I wanted to do a campaign or I was reaching out to people who post about Samsung phones and

194
00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.300
I click that button it's just doing all the work for me.

195
00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:50.990
These are all Samsung account Samsung Galaxy Bayda Samsung lifestyle Samsung Galaxy fans and on Beta.

196
00:11:51.050 --> 00:11:54.770
These are all basically perfectly curated for what I'm looking for.

197
00:11:54.770 --> 00:11:59.420
So when you are looking for people in your space that's going to be doing a section will be listing

198
00:11:59.420 --> 00:12:03.660
off people so that we can keep tabs on them see what content they're posting what works and then we

199
00:12:03.710 --> 00:12:04.930
eventually reach out to them.

200
00:12:04.970 --> 00:12:06.500
This is probably the fastest way you can do it.

201
00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:10.640
You find one account that you think really really fits your space and then you just go and have a downer

202
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:15.080
and look at the suggested in some of these might not necessarily be perfect but if you find one that

203
00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:20.450
does fit like let's say for you know let's say 3D printing 101 we're doing a 3-D printing account we

204
00:12:20.450 --> 00:12:24.640
can click that come through and voila we can actually do this again.

205
00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:28.640
Now it's going to give me probably similar searches but it's slightly different.

206
00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:30.010
So we'll find some more.

207
00:12:30.020 --> 00:12:34.270
And that's another way of kind of cross-referencing or spreading your net into different places.

208
00:12:34.370 --> 00:12:35.220
Now this cracks me up.

209
00:12:35.230 --> 00:12:41.120
I didn't even play on this but they are re posting one of our posts as you can see the innovation station

210
00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.720
logo at the bottom.

211
00:12:42.950 --> 00:12:48.800
And they did not give us actually any attribution which I think is pretty funny so I'll post on there

212
00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:51.650
and tell them hey you should probably say who we are.

213
00:12:51.650 --> 00:12:52.940
All right guys that pretty much sums it up.

214
00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.910
We have the search explore page that's useful occasionally for keeping tabs on the content of the people

215
00:12:58.910 --> 00:12:59.550
you follow.

216
00:12:59.550 --> 00:13:03.280
Didn't we have the actual search function which is pretty useful.

217
00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.760
You're going to use that constantly to find new accounts especially if you're hunting for content or

218
00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:09.530
just for accounts to reach out to.

219
00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:14.060
And then the last thing is the individual people's pages really only thing that matters there is that

220
00:13:14.060 --> 00:13:18.430
you can click to go on their pages and see their followers or see their likes and that is pretty useful

221
00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.080
but you can also use the embedded Instagram suggested tool.

222
00:13:22.130 --> 00:13:25.420
And that's a great way of finding accounts that are similar.

223
00:13:25.490 --> 00:13:25.850
All right guys.

224
00:13:25.850 --> 00:13:26.390
That being said.

225
00:13:26.410 --> 00:13:27.730
See you in the next lecture.
