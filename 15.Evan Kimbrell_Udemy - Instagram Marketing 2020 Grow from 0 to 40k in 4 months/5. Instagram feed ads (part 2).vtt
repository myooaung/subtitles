00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:10.680
Need out here this is really where we start to deviate from the traditional Facebook Marketing playbook.

2
00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:17.170
Really all you do is hit edit placements and what are you going to do here is you're going to see that

3
00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.650
it's already checked everything.

4
00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:18.930
Right.

5
00:00:18.930 --> 00:00:24.010
So it's set up for Facebook is set up for messenger ads meaning people are using Facebook Messenger

6
00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:24.560
will see this.

7
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:28.580
And so you want to click everything that's not related to Instagram.

8
00:00:28.660 --> 00:00:29.340
OK.

9
00:00:29.780 --> 00:00:30.220
Here we go.

10
00:00:30.220 --> 00:00:32.040
Now we're focused solely on Instagram.

11
00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:33.200
You know there's two different ones.

12
00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.510
It's the feed and the stories.

13
00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:39.150
Now typically speaking you could make one.

14
00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:42.910
And that works for both but it's generally a bad idea.

15
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:43.330
Why.

16
00:00:43.330 --> 00:00:46.300
Because stories are a different size.

17
00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.900
You don't have to shoot them in that vertical portrait ratio.

18
00:00:49.900 --> 00:00:56.920
And then also a story last 15 seconds where as a feed can last up to 60 seconds so unless your ideal

19
00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:03.430
hand just happens to be 10 seconds to or whatever 14 seconds 15 seconds it's probably the best case

20
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:06.910
that you just do two separate ones one for the future one for the stories.

21
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:10.200
So let's just uncheck stories for now and then later on we'll do stories.

22
00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:11.040
OK.

23
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:16.350
Then when notice up here it says device types and typically they recommend that you do mobile and desktop

24
00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.500
and give you a little bit of a hint just in general with advertising.

25
00:01:19.500 --> 00:01:23.950
If you want to sell something or get some type of engagement like a lead gen or something like that

26
00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:29.890
desktops are always better than mobile mobile is going to be cheaper and it's easier to display ads

27
00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:30.280
on mobile.

28
00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:34.010
But people who use mobile apps are just less likely to buy something.

29
00:01:34.180 --> 00:01:40.180
However zuÃ±i keep in mind Instagram does not have a lot of people using their web version Enscribe tries

30
00:01:40.180 --> 00:01:44.330
very hard to force people to only use their mobile version so keep that in mind.

31
00:01:44.380 --> 00:01:46.130
I usually just say all devices anyway.

32
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.870
Doesn't matter.

33
00:01:46.870 --> 00:01:49.290
I can always drill them later and decide if I don't like that.

34
00:01:51.390 --> 00:01:56.010
Down here I could say specific mobile devices if I wanted to basically iOS or Android I don't see any

35
00:01:56.010 --> 00:02:01.410
reason why only when connected to Wi-Fi that's a really weird one that you might want to drill down

36
00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:01.610
on.

37
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:02.510
Doesn't really matter.

38
00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:06.990
Now down here we have the budget and schedule now you can do a daily budget or a lifetime budget.

39
00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:12.000
Now if I say a daily budget $20 Well that's what I'll spend throughout the day and what's going to determine

40
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.140
how it spends that money.

41
00:02:13.140 --> 00:02:14.040
Here is schedule.

42
00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.650
Now if I had a lifetime budget I would say lifetime budget and it automatically multiplies it to 350.

43
00:02:19.650 --> 00:02:20.310
OK.

44
00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.650
Now if you have a lifetime budget and let's say 350.

45
00:02:23.670 --> 00:02:30.090
That doesn't mean that it's going to spread out $350 over the rest of your life or over this time period

46
00:02:30.090 --> 00:02:31.110
we set here.

47
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:35.880
What I will do is it all follow other parameters here and I'll try to get you the best clicks and when

48
00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.520
you run out it will automatically just start for you.

49
00:02:38.550 --> 00:02:42.840
Doing a lifetime budget you obviously have to set a start and end because it needs to know over what

50
00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:45.400
time period am I supposed to be spending this money.

51
00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:48.120
So let's just say a daily budget that's simpler to use.

52
00:02:48.120 --> 00:02:51.030
And also if you're trying to run an ad it makes a lot more sense.

53
00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:55.200
Certainly if you're in the early stages of testing that we could just set it up such that it's let's

54
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:00.180
say it's like five bucks a day and I can just say 10 bucks a day and to see how it doesn't and maybe

55
00:03:00.180 --> 00:03:03.340
after a day or two I can turn it off if it's not doing well.

56
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:06.300
Now I can just say run mad at continuously starting today.

57
00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.730
That simple visit for the most part just means it will start running immediately.

58
00:03:09.750 --> 00:03:11.730
I might set a schedule start and end date.

59
00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:15.990
For instance I was running a promotion and only applied to a certain time period that would help me

60
00:03:15.990 --> 00:03:20.280
such that I don't run ads during a period where it's not optimal.

61
00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:25.230
Now here we have optimization for ad delivery so we have link Clix landing page views impressions and

62
00:03:25.230 --> 00:03:26.410
Alieni Creech.

63
00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.600
Honestly this is something that more advanced marketers will do.

64
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:35.260
But basically Facebook's looking for one specific metric to optimize for.

65
00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:38.520
So if you're going for Link clicks they're going to really get you the most of those.

66
00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:43.020
If you're trying to drive someone to a Web site and landing page views is what they'll try to go for

67
00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:46.180
and see what what's the difference.

68
00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.100
Well because if someone clicks a link and they exit out before they get to the landing page and they

69
00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:53.190
don't even sit on your lazy page long second that person doesn't count.

70
00:03:53.190 --> 00:03:58.320
So you click this one instead what's going to happen is they're going to look for people who tend to

71
00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.930
stick on your page don't click and just immediately leave and then it'll build a profile over time of

72
00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.990
the types of people that are doing this and they'll start to drive your ads towards those people.

73
00:04:09.240 --> 00:04:14.220
All things like impressions and Dayle unique reach those are just simpler things that you know if it's

74
00:04:14.220 --> 00:04:18.750
impressions maybe you're only going for brand recognition and you really care if they click on your

75
00:04:18.750 --> 00:04:19.540
AD.

76
00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:23.690
So that's what they're going to do is try to get you the cheapest impressions possible.

77
00:04:23.700 --> 00:04:27.660
Typically you don't know you're doing just go for Link clicks unless for some reason again you're just

78
00:04:27.660 --> 00:04:29.550
trying to like get your name out there.

79
00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:34.110
Then in that case you might do impressions if you want to you can do what's called a setting a bid cap

80
00:04:34.110 --> 00:04:35.060
right here.

81
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:37.540
It's not generally something I recommend if you don't know what you're doing.

82
00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:43.470
But typically what's going to happen is that it's an auction system so every time a user is scrolling

83
00:04:43.470 --> 00:04:50.190
through Instagram they have a system the back and that's negotiating between different advertisers whoever

84
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:55.530
is going to pay the most and has the best quality score or like Google calls relevancy score is going

85
00:04:55.530 --> 00:04:56.750
to get shown.

86
00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.430
So if let's say you're selling something through a post and it's a really expensive item let's say you're

87
00:05:02.670 --> 00:05:06.240
Kaspar over here and you're selling mattresses that are you know five hundred dollars.

88
00:05:06.270 --> 00:05:08.310
Well you could probably pay a lot more per click.

89
00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:12.900
You should have some idea of what the likelihood of that person going to your pages and converting you

90
00:05:12.900 --> 00:05:18.360
don't know then typically I'd just like to turn off the bid cap and then see how much it ends up costing

91
00:05:18.360 --> 00:05:21.350
and once I get some real traffic I can see what the value of that is.

92
00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.770
And then I can start to go backwards and budget and it's all pretty important that you let your daily

93
00:05:25.770 --> 00:05:30.720
limit be pretty conservative because you don't want to run out of money before you can figure out how

94
00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:32.070
to tune this thing correctly.

95
00:05:32.070 --> 00:05:38.640
Now the last thing you'll notice here is delivery type and what you can do is you can run an accelerated

96
00:05:38.730 --> 00:05:39.390
delivery type.

97
00:05:39.390 --> 00:05:44.610
So basically what that means is if I had a $20 daily budget and I wanted to do a standard that means

98
00:05:44.610 --> 00:05:46.700
that it's going to spread it out throughout the day.

99
00:05:46.770 --> 00:05:52.230
But if I was really impatient let's say or I'm running a test I want to get information as soon as possible.

100
00:05:52.230 --> 00:05:57.030
I can run an accelerated test and I would basically spend your money rapidly and soon as it hits the

101
00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:01.440
daily limit and the lifetime limit stop and then you have it's daily limit the next day it'll start

102
00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:02.040
again.

103
00:06:02.070 --> 00:06:05.210
So for these for the most part doesn't really matter and is going to continue.

104
00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:08.330
OK now we have to choose our identity.

105
00:06:08.370 --> 00:06:14.640
You can have it related directly to a Facebook page or directly to an Instagram page so you have an

106
00:06:14.640 --> 00:06:18.060
entry and add your account just add your account here it's pretty easy.

107
00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:23.040
OK so once we add our account shows up like that make sure that you've selected the correct Facebook

108
00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:25.730
page otherwise you'll have trouble connecting that.

109
00:06:25.770 --> 00:06:27.940
Now it gives us the option of picking a format.

110
00:06:28.010 --> 00:06:34.230
We have carousels single images single videos slideshows which are basically stick a bunch of images

111
00:06:34.490 --> 00:06:39.880
and slides for you and then collections which are really not worth playing around with.

112
00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:41.830
Aren't here what you can do if you want to.

113
00:06:41.850 --> 00:06:43.710
And it's called the instant experience.

114
00:06:43.710 --> 00:06:45.990
This takes a little bit more time to play around it.

115
00:06:46.260 --> 00:06:52.830
But if you do want to do it what ends up happening is once they click the and it will open up into a

116
00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:56.950
different page that kind of takes over the whole screen.

117
00:06:56.970 --> 00:07:01.200
This can be kind of useful if you're trying to give a little bit more of a brand appearance to what

118
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:06.360
you're doing so you kind of see right here for instance if let's say we were not going to direct people

119
00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:07.930
direct to our Web site.

120
00:07:08.100 --> 00:07:13.410
We could have them click the page and then take us to this form page right here and right and then we

121
00:07:13.410 --> 00:07:19.860
could use that as a lead generation or we could create our own in app page right here that shows for

122
00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:21.580
instance like products we're selling.

123
00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:25.530
So maybe they're not specifically interested in just that product they could be interested in more.

124
00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:29.940
Usually this is more of an advance strategy and it depends on what you're selling when you're just driving

125
00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:32.000
traffic and it shouldn't really be that complicated.

126
00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:33.390
So it's a single video.

127
00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:37.620
OK so now for the video we're at here we can upload whatever it is we want.

128
00:07:37.620 --> 00:07:39.780
You could use a post that you've had before.

129
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:44.170
I'm just going you the posts that we've actually used as a promotional post before in the past.

130
00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:46.250
So once that's uploading I'll show you.

131
00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:47.970
Don't hear what else we have going on.

132
00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:50.690
So right here we select the link type for your.

133
00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:55.050
And if you're doing a Facebook event well then you could promote it through Instagram and then have

134
00:07:55.050 --> 00:07:57.040
them go directly to a Facebook event.

135
00:07:57.390 --> 00:08:01.120
It's assuming they have Facebook on their phone which most people do if it's just a Web site that you

136
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:02.160
could just go to a Web site.

137
00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:05.770
Also Similarly if you want to drive them messenger you can change it at this point.

138
00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:08.300
But we've already established before that we're not doing that.

139
00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.170
Here you have to give a web site you are all.

140
00:08:11.190 --> 00:08:13.950
So it just depends on what it was.

141
00:08:13.950 --> 00:08:18.690
You know if I had innovations station as a web site I could say let's drive them to that.

142
00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:28.620
Then we could say you know whatever the specific item was see maybe those finger keyboard tools that

143
00:08:28.620 --> 00:08:30.840
we talked about in the boosting post section.

144
00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:32.030
OK.

145
00:08:32.070 --> 00:08:33.640
And we're still waiting for this upload.

146
00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:35.790
So there isn't then though we have a text.

147
00:08:35.790 --> 00:08:40.020
We'll have our call to action will have multiple language formats if we want to.

148
00:08:40.080 --> 00:08:41.990
And then if we want to set a Facebook pixel.

149
00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:44.300
But for us this isn't terribly important.

150
00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:50.480
All right now that the video has uploaded took a little bit video file itself was actually kind of large.

151
00:08:50.490 --> 00:08:53.980
You can preview it right here.

152
00:08:57.140 --> 00:09:02.670
One item designed has proved to be old.

153
00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:10.590
It's the same square ratio that you need for a feed post.

154
00:09:10.830 --> 00:09:12.540
So we can see it right here actually.

155
00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:17.560
So this little look like a sponsored will say learn more to take us to the Web site.

156
00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:22.950
Unfortunately you cannot drive them directly back to your own Instagram account through this if you

157
00:09:22.950 --> 00:09:23.550
want to do that.

158
00:09:23.550 --> 00:09:30.120
You just have to post this as a regular post and then boost it like we did in the previous lectures

159
00:09:30.130 --> 00:09:35.880
so keep that in mind although I don't know why you want to do it to the Facebook advertisement platform

160
00:09:35.880 --> 00:09:38.580
versus just say the mobile one with Instagram.

161
00:09:38.590 --> 00:09:39.940
Visually the same features.

162
00:09:39.990 --> 00:09:40.250
OK.

163
00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.070
Then you can choose your call to action.

164
00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:45.020
Typically you want to pick whatever makes the most sense.

165
00:09:45.090 --> 00:09:50.300
And generally speaking if you're trying to sell something still trying to do something that's like a

166
00:09:50.310 --> 00:09:57.780
learn more is very easy light sell or if you had something like by now it's typically going to turn

167
00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.340
off a lot of people even if they're interested.

168
00:09:59.340 --> 00:10:00.570
So keep that in mind.

169
00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.760
All right so that's pretty much it.

170
00:10:01.770 --> 00:10:05.790
And then if I wanted to run this I would just confirm then it would go through a review process and

171
00:10:05.790 --> 00:10:08.820
then I'd be able to check over the analytics as it runs.

172
00:10:08.820 --> 00:10:10.770
All right guys that is it for now.

173
00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:18.450
Now you know the basics of how to run through Facebook advertising platform and to set up an Instagram

174
00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.370
specific feed post.

175
00:10:20.370 --> 00:10:26.550
Now in the next set of lectures we'll go over story posts will actually just start from the section

176
00:10:26.610 --> 00:10:31.530
of here where we go to the ad set so that we don't have to go all the way from the beginning to show

177
00:10:31.530 --> 00:10:35.690
you how are you targeting and geographic demographics and interests and things like that.

178
00:10:35.910 --> 00:10:36.430
OK.

179
00:10:36.430 --> 00:10:36.850
See the.
