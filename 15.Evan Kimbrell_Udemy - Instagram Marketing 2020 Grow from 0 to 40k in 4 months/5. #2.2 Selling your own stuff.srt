1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:02,010
All right guys we'll come back to this lecture.

2
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:06,750
We're going to talk about what's the most effective way to monetize your account by selling your own

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:07,620
stuff.

4
00:00:07,660 --> 00:00:12,900
Now no not going to get into how to create your own products that's an entirely different course or

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:16,980
how to pick products to sell or how to make them manufacture them so like that.

6
00:00:17,130 --> 00:00:19,580
That is just WAY outside the purview of the course.

7
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:24,270
What I will show you though is if you have a product or service or something that you've made that you

8
00:00:24,270 --> 00:00:30,500
have more control over than if you're in sales and affiliate marketing situation a show you probably

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,550
what the most effective way of selling that is and that's through a relatively new feature called chartable

10
00:00:35,550 --> 00:00:36,390
with Instagram.

11
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,590
Now what is your team's done is that they've realized that a lot of people sell stuff through their

12
00:00:40,590 --> 00:00:47,800
accounts whether it's books courses shoes fashion clothing whatever.

13
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:52,290
A lot of companies that are retail or have something to sell are on Instagram and a lot of times they

14
00:00:52,530 --> 00:00:57,060
will feature the post or feature whatever they're trying to sell.

15
00:00:57,210 --> 00:01:00,590
And before they would do as they would say go to my bio and click on it.

16
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,760
Now what they've done is they've opened it up such that if you have your own store specifically to use

17
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,940
a platform like Facebook or Shopify or Oblio like Squarespace and we believe in things like that you

18
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:17,370
can automatically integrate this into it and then automatically sell whatever it is you're posting directly

19
00:01:17,370 --> 00:01:18,060
to your account.

20
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:20,850
So to give you an example of this let's look at urban outfitters.

21
00:01:20,970 --> 00:01:22,830
They're an account that does this.

22
00:01:22,890 --> 00:01:23,110
OK.

23
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:26,820
So right here you see they have eight million people that's a ton.

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,240
Now you'll notice is if it has this little bag at the top you can kind of see here.

25
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:35,180
That means that whatever is in this is a shock ball post.

26
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,620
And the way that this works is very similar as tagging.

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,620
You know we tag people are posting it.

28
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,840
We just touch it and then tag where on the image we want the tag to be and then who do we want to be

29
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:46,560
tagged.

30
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:48,640
So same thing with items right.

31
00:01:48,660 --> 00:01:52,390
So if they see their dress you can just click on the dot.

32
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:52,880
OK.

33
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:56,420
And we see our $69 floral dress.

34
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:57,060
OK.

35
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:58,250
That click through.

36
00:01:58,260 --> 00:01:58,740
There you go.

37
00:01:58,740 --> 00:01:59,430
Now it can actually.

38
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,930
Show me what they're selling and gives me a link directly to see it on their Web site.

39
00:02:03,950 --> 00:02:08,370
And if I click through I just go directly to their Web site and this is a feature that's changing quite

40
00:02:08,370 --> 00:02:10,110
a bit as I'm filming this.

41
00:02:10,290 --> 00:02:15,090
When they first came out with it it was like you can only sell if you had your products listed on Facebook

42
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,600
and then it was Facebook and Shopify and now it's Facebook Shopify and private integrations with large

43
00:02:21,600 --> 00:02:22,380
companies.

44
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:22,920
OK.

45
00:02:23,130 --> 00:02:27,690
Because if you have your own Web site it's professionally made it's not made through Wordpress or any

46
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:30,590
of those other platforms you might have to wait on this.

47
00:02:30,990 --> 00:02:35,010
But for the most part you can use it if you use any of the platforms.

48
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:40,290
Now one other thing I want to point out is when you start doing Schappell posts it'll change your home

49
00:02:40,290 --> 00:02:43,440
page slightly such that you'll have this Shatha button.

50
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,010
Now remember we signed up as a business account and it gave us the option of giving contact information

51
00:02:48,010 --> 00:02:49,920
in there for a phone number or an email.

52
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:51,150
And that's what shows up there.

53
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:54,210
So I think on our account yeah we have e-mail right there.

54
00:02:54,210 --> 00:02:57,210
But on their account let's get back to them.

55
00:02:57,270 --> 00:03:02,340
They have a shop button so I can click shop and it gives me this feed of all the things that are swappable.

56
00:03:02,370 --> 00:03:02,670
OK.

57
00:03:02,670 --> 00:03:03,940
So keep that in mind.

58
00:03:03,970 --> 00:03:08,250
Now the first step if you want to do this is to make sure that your account is a business account and

59
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:10,290
if you're following this course you've already done that.

60
00:03:10,290 --> 00:03:14,910
Right we did as way back at the beginning because in order to get Analytics from Instagram we had to

61
00:03:14,910 --> 00:03:19,530
sign up for a business account you never meant to do that pretty easy just go to your settings and I

62
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,210
think it clicks it's like switch to a business account or upgrade to a business account.

63
00:03:23,310 --> 00:03:24,420
It doesn't take very long.

64
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,280
Anybody can do it as long as you email address and then you give them a phone number or some form of

65
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:33,240
contact information for users coming to your account.

66
00:03:33,240 --> 00:03:39,510
Now the easiest way to sell something would be to use that Facebook page or we had to set up when we

67
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:40,740
created our Instagram account.

68
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:43,830
So let's go to the Facebook page that we have for innovation station.

69
00:03:43,830 --> 00:03:48,930
We set this up just because we wanted to set it up as a business hadn't yet turned this into anything

70
00:03:48,930 --> 00:03:49,740
useful.

71
00:03:49,740 --> 00:03:54,210
We do have a section on how to turn your Facebook page into something that can funnel traffic towards

72
00:03:54,240 --> 00:03:54,820
your account.

73
00:03:54,870 --> 00:03:56,850
But as I'm filming this now we haven't yet done that.

74
00:03:56,850 --> 00:04:00,980
So go to the page you made and most likely it probably just looks like this.

75
00:04:00,990 --> 00:04:06,480
Now typically what can happen over here is you're going to have a bunch of automatic tabs that are created

76
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,710
for your count and these are generated based on the type of account you signed up for this Internet

77
00:04:10,710 --> 00:04:13,620
company so I got posts and reviews and whatever.

78
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:18,000
Now I click see more and I have this one called Shop and that's where I want to go.

79
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:24,060
Now if you don't see that which a lot of you guys want you want to go over here to settings and then

80
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:28,950
go to edit page and it'll show you whatever your template is mine standard right now.

81
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:29,370
Cool.

82
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:36,660
So then down here I have my tabs and if I don't have shopped or not there I just hit ad tab and then

83
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:39,670
it should allow me to select shop as one of these.

84
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:39,970
OK.

85
00:04:39,970 --> 00:04:41,010
So that's what you have to do.

86
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:46,140
Now keep in mind depending on where you guys are in the world this might not actually be available to

87
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:46,400
you.

88
00:04:46,440 --> 00:04:55,980
Right now I know in the U.S. the U.K. Canada Germany France Spain Australia Japan countries like those

89
00:04:56,130 --> 00:04:59,830
they do have this I don't know if they've rolled this out necessarily.

90
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:06,440
For India or some of them like Middle Eastern or African countries they're rolling it out slowly so

91
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:13,250
if you don't see it then unfortunately it's just not there and chartable posts are not going to be available

92
00:05:13,250 --> 00:05:13,940
to you.

93
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:20,180
There's some work arounds for that and put some resources Taxus lecture if you fall into that category

94
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:22,600
and you really do want to be Schappell will post so check that out.

95
00:05:22,640 --> 00:05:28,520
OK now once I have that shot and set up I just want to do and Cliggott and what will happen is a little

96
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,800
give me this walkthrough where it says set up your shop and essentially what I want to do is I'm going

97
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,130
to add products to innovation station and then because it's already sync with my instagram because he

98
00:05:40,130 --> 00:05:44,560
did this and we created a business account I then will have the option of selecting those.

99
00:05:44,570 --> 00:05:50,780
Now keep in mind once I set this up I have to go through a review process with Instagram and it takes

100
00:05:50,780 --> 00:05:57,340
two to three days and they have to prove that yes in fact I am a shopper at least I have real products.

101
00:05:57,350 --> 00:06:01,080
I'm not even sure what the criteria are but it's a two to three day waiting period.

102
00:06:01,130 --> 00:06:05,570
So in order to show you to the very end of this because Also I'm not trying to sell specific things

103
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:08,250
on innovation station that's not our time to try to monetize it.

104
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:11,270
But keep in mind that's kind of the end of the process.

105
00:06:11,270 --> 00:06:12,940
So get get started.

106
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:16,550
And then what we do is we just pick our region pick a business type.

107
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,590
This is just how you incorporated it.

108
00:06:19,640 --> 00:06:24,100
So I can say sole proprietorship does do whatever address I can think of.

109
00:06:26,650 --> 00:06:31,400
It's important that you give an actual physical address you can receive mail to show because this is

110
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,950
how we verify that you are in fact real and not some fly by night team that's just going to sell crap

111
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:39,920
and then run away then and ask you for a registration number.

112
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:47,000
Now this you can skip but generally it's just one of those things if you have it and the Instagram process

113
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:48,920
will go a lot faster if you skip it.

114
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:51,070
Then I decided that yeah I want to get paid in currency.

115
00:06:51,080 --> 00:06:52,570
They charge a processing fee.

116
00:06:52,580 --> 00:06:54,720
Pretty similar you get with a credit card finish.

117
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,100
OK so next up you're going to want to add products and then set up your payments.

118
00:06:59,110 --> 00:07:03,710
Now you have to do both of those before you can even think of doing this on Instagram.

119
00:07:03,710 --> 00:07:10,790
Now I would go to add a product and it's going to have a price the name description and then how many

120
00:07:10,790 --> 00:07:14,050
of these I can sell and then some shipping options.

121
00:07:14,060 --> 00:07:19,220
So one of the things that I was I got a lot of attention for was a hydrofoil and it kind of looks like

122
00:07:19,220 --> 00:07:22,110
this is really goofy but it's like you're surfing in the air.

123
00:07:22,250 --> 00:07:27,320
So let's say maybe I wanted to put this as a product down I wish I could publish this because it's not

124
00:07:27,320 --> 00:07:29,930
my product but I could completely do this.

125
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,620
So I asked the company that it was OK to sell it on my account.

126
00:07:33,890 --> 00:07:40,360
So now we have an image of that image Dhoop OK use that photo.

127
00:07:40,370 --> 00:07:47,740
Then I get a call or it's hydrofoil set the price.

128
00:07:47,740 --> 00:07:51,530
God what was it like eight billion dollars.

129
00:07:51,580 --> 00:07:55,140
It was too good and so sweet.

130
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:57,950
So we'll put it at a premium.

131
00:07:58,170 --> 00:07:59,930
You know obviously it makes money.

132
00:08:00,100 --> 00:08:04,840
And then the description I'll just borrow from them because I do generally speaking these companies

133
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,370
do a great job of writing their own descriptions and I'll go here.

134
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:10,560
Copy that in my inventory.

135
00:08:10,600 --> 00:08:11,420
It doesn't really matter.

136
00:08:11,470 --> 00:08:13,030
I'm just buying from them directly.

137
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:17,290
So let's say we have 10 and we can do standard shipping.

138
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:20,650
Now I'm in the U.S. So it's probably gonna work a little bit different.

139
00:08:20,650 --> 00:08:26,050
I don't know what the page looks like if I were in Japan for example I would give something like an

140
00:08:26,050 --> 00:08:27,670
estimated days of delivery.

141
00:08:27,670 --> 00:08:30,350
It kind of depends how quickly you can buy it.

142
00:08:30,370 --> 00:08:34,060
Typically what I would do is I just go to this company and see what their shipping options are and what

143
00:08:34,060 --> 00:08:36,840
they quote because I'm just going go over and buy it from them.

144
00:08:36,850 --> 00:08:41,710
If I were actually going to sell this but let's just say theoretically three to 10 days the price for

145
00:08:41,710 --> 00:08:43,600
shipping is probably pretty expensive.

146
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:45,990
And price per additional item.

147
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:49,620
Okay maybe it's a little bit less than originally what it was.

148
00:08:49,840 --> 00:08:51,470
OK so 10 days.

149
00:08:51,500 --> 00:08:51,750
Right.

150
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:57,280
So they want it to be no less than 7 so it's 7 great save that we have a return policy 30 days increase

151
00:08:57,320 --> 00:09:00,210
a customer if you want to and then you can always put it in the product category.

152
00:09:00,220 --> 00:09:01,470
I'm going to get it safe.

153
00:09:01,850 --> 00:09:02,210
Okay.

154
00:09:02,230 --> 00:09:03,430
And how can they contact me.

155
00:09:03,430 --> 00:09:05,440
I'll just put one of my e-mail addresses.

156
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:09,940
All enable messenger sure they've got it.

157
00:09:10,010 --> 00:09:10,530
OK.

158
00:09:10,550 --> 00:09:13,650
Now this should show up in my shop.

159
00:09:14,180 --> 00:09:14,720
Ok cool.

160
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,310
So I have a super sweet hydrofoils processing which means it is going to go through some algorithm checks

161
00:09:19,310 --> 00:09:24,700
to make sure that a bunch of things that your numbers make sense that perhaps it actually looks.

162
00:09:24,710 --> 00:09:28,520
See if you borrowed the image elsewhere I seriously doubt that one but once I have this set up I want

163
00:09:28,520 --> 00:09:29,540
to set up my payments.

164
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:30,170
Not going to do that.

165
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:31,820
I'm not selling anything.

166
00:09:31,850 --> 00:09:35,580
But I'll try to set up my payments once that's done.

167
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,090
Then it's just a matter of making sure that my account is attached to Instagram and the way you do that

168
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:43,760
just go to settings and then we'll go down to Instagram.

169
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,630
Pretty easy.

170
00:09:44,780 --> 00:09:46,850
And it already has my thing right here.

171
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:51,920
But if it didn't I would have to add right there and then attach my account to it.

172
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:57,440
Then what happens is in Instagram when you post something you'll post a photo of whatever the product

173
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,410
is and you'll have an additional option right where it says or tag people it will say tag products.

174
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:07,670
Now you can only do one or the other to attack people you can't tag products tag products can attack

175
00:10:07,670 --> 00:10:08,470
people.

176
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,100
It works pretty much the same way as tagging people and I believe there's a limit on how many things

177
00:10:13,100 --> 00:10:15,100
you can tag per image but it's a pretty high limit.

178
00:10:15,110 --> 00:10:16,770
So it's not really something to worry about.

179
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:22,640
Once you do that you just you just click on the item and then it'll give you an option to pull from

180
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,530
a list of products you have and it's whatever going to be listed on my Facebook.

181
00:10:27,620 --> 00:10:29,910
And that is pretty much it.

182
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:35,810
Now I said this before you have to go through an approval process and that can take probably one to

183
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:42,020
two days on Facebook and then two to three business days Instagram's and this largely depends on what

184
00:10:42,020 --> 00:10:45,450
you're selling whether or not you have a web presence elsewhere if you have a Web site.

185
00:10:45,450 --> 00:10:48,070
You make yourselves and your website should be pretty easy.

186
00:10:48,080 --> 00:10:53,390
There is a limit geographically but they're expanding that pretty rapidly so by the time you watch this

187
00:10:53,390 --> 00:10:56,170
who knows they're probably selling us pretty much everywhere.

188
00:10:56,240 --> 00:10:59,020
OK so that I think is the ideal way to sell your own stuff.

189
00:10:59,030 --> 00:11:03,380
You do a post that highlights something you're selling you Taggett as a product and allow them to buy

190
00:11:03,380 --> 00:11:03,600
it.

191
00:11:03,620 --> 00:11:06,900
That by far has the highest conversion rate for retail.

192
00:11:07,010 --> 00:11:12,140
And that's why I kind of focus on using that specifically if you have your own products to sell.

193
00:11:12,140 --> 00:11:15,080
Now keep in mind this doesn't just work for retail.

194
00:11:15,080 --> 00:11:18,500
You can use it for software or e-books or whatever.

195
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:25,640
If you go and look at like founder their account they sell software and online courses all the time

196
00:11:25,670 --> 00:11:29,430
and they use the same shop lable posts so keep that in mind.

197
00:11:29,570 --> 00:11:35,270
With that being said we're going to move on to the third way of making money and that is flipping your

198
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,710
account.

199
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:36,230
See the.
