Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:11.760
All right, so in this section what we're going to talk about is one
of the major tools we use to grow our Instagram accounts,
2

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:12.810
All right, so in this section what we're going to talk about is one
of the major tools we use to grow our Instagram accounts,
3

4
00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:14.120
and those are shoutouts.
4

5
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:21.130
Now, have you ever noticed how if you're looking at someone
else's profile and you notice either one of the photos
5

6
00:00:21.140 --> 00:00:28.710
just doesn't match the rest of them or just one of the more
recent posts that you saw just didn't seem to match what
6

7
00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.370
just doesn't match the rest of them or just one of the more
recent posts that you saw just didn't seem to match what
7

8
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.310
they usually post, and then you looked at the caption
and you saw someone else being tagged in it?
8

9
00:00:34.350 --> 00:00:39.280
Well, if you haven't seen it, it's actually really easy to find.
I'll show you, watch. On Innovation Station, literally the first one.
9

10
00:00:39.390 --> 00:00:40.320
Well, if you haven't seen it, it's actually really easy to find.
I'll show you, watch. On Innovation Station, literally the first one.
10

11
00:00:40.340 --> 00:00:44.440
Simple Pickup Lines, I don't know why
I'm following them, but hey, look.
11

12
00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.220
What I can do is I can just look down here.
12

13
00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.650
Okay, they usually post sentences.
13

14
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:51.550
So this is not a sentence, this one. "I'm crying,
I'm so happy for them." Click that, look.
14

15
00:00:51.610 --> 00:00:53.660
So this is not a sentence, this one. "I'm crying,
I'm so happy for them." Click that, look.
15

16
00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:00.930
It's clearly not what they use, and then if we look at the bottom,
"Follow @reallydumbtweets for the funniest posts ever."
16

17
00:01:00.930 --> 00:01:01.490
There you go.
17

18
00:01:01.500 --> 00:01:02.630
That's a shoutout.
18

19
00:01:02.790 --> 00:01:04.060
Let's see if we can find another one.
19

20
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:06.690
That's going to be a shoutout right there.
20

21
00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.560
Then we go down to another one.
21

22
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.050
Let's say tutorials.gallery, and here it looks like they're all
the same, but I can probably just click through one.
22

23
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.450
Let's say @tutorials.gallery, and here it looks like they're
all the same, but I can probably just click through one.
23

24
00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:17.450
Here you go.
24

25
00:01:17.490 --> 00:01:18.600
"Follow @society.diy," that's not them,
that's @tutorials.gallery. This one,
25

26
00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.030
"Follow @society.diy," that's not them,
that's @tutorials.gallery. This one,
26

27
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:20.480
"Follow @society.diy," that's not them,
that's @tutorials.gallery. This one,
27

28
00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:23.620
"Follow @society.diy," that's not them,
that's @tutorials.gallery. This one,
28

29
00:01:23.690 --> 00:01:25.950
"Follow @cooper_calligraphy."
29

30
00:01:26.090 --> 00:01:26.630
OK.
30

31
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:30.670
That has nothing to do with them.
31

32
00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:31.750
That is a shoutout.
32

33
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:32.390
So that's a shoutout.
33

34
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:33.330
Now you've seen it,
34

35
00:01:33.330 --> 00:01:40.500
now you can never unsee it. Big accounts often use them
all the time and the way that it works is basically like
35

36
00:01:40.500 --> 00:01:44.670
saying, "Hey, this other person posts really good stuff.
36

37
00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:48.030
Check them out" or "This post is really funny. You
might like this account." In the land of Instagram,
37

38
00:01:48.030 --> 00:01:50.410
Check them out" or "This post is really funny. You
might like this account." In the land of Instagram,
38

39
00:01:50.430 --> 00:01:51.120
Check them out" or "This post is really funny. You
might like this account." In the land of Instagram,
39

40
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:54.320
everything runs off of reciprocity.
40

41
00:01:54.460 --> 00:01:57.210
If we were all just islands of ourselves
41

42
00:01:57.210 --> 00:02:00.480
who just posted and never collaborated with anybody else,
42

43
00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:05.770
we would all grow at a much slower pace, and the
average Instagram user would follow far fewer people.
43

44
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.470
Since Instagram doesn't really facilitate
the process of cross collaboration,
44

45
00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:15.990
this is kind of the informal way that people have managed to do it,
and it's through what we call shoutouts or shout for shouts.
45

46
00:02:15.990 --> 00:02:17.360
this is kind of the informal way that people have managed to do it,
and it's through what we call shoutouts or shout for shouts.
46

47
00:02:17.370 --> 00:02:20.970
Now, is there a difference between shoutouts
and shout for shouts? Well, a shoutout is
47

48
00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.150
just when someone posts someone else's stuff and then
mentions them, and a shout for shout is when there's a trade,
48

49
00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:30.450
they post something and then another
account posts something, and
49

50
00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:37.080
oftentimes, if you go to a shoutout and click through to the
account that they're directing you to, if you go to that account,
50

51
00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:37.690
oftentimes, if you go to a shoutout and click through to the
account that they're directing you to, if you go to that account,
51

52
00:02:37.830 --> 00:02:41.650
usually the first or the post right
before the last one they have,
52

53
00:02:41.790 --> 00:02:45.760
that links back to the original account,
because it's a reciprocity thing.
53

54
00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:52.200
All right, so let's cover the five main types of shoutouts
we see out there and are open for us to use.
54

55
00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:52.800
All right, so let's cover the five main types of shoutouts
we see out there and are open for us to use.
55

56
00:02:53.090 --> 00:02:54.870
One is a timed shoutout,
56

57
00:02:54.870 --> 00:02:57.420
number two is a permanent shoutout,
57

58
00:02:57.420 --> 00:03:00.100
number three is a caption shoutout,
58

59
00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.960
number four is a story shoutout, and
59

60
00:03:02.010 --> 00:03:04.310
number five is a paid shoutout.
Okay, let's start with the first one.
60

61
00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:05.320
number five is a paid shoutout.
Okay, let's start with the first one.
61

62
00:03:05.340 --> 00:03:06.930
So what is a timed shoutout?
62

63
00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.050
Well, that's when someone reposts
a photo or video from you,
63

64
00:03:10.050 --> 00:03:15.580
they tag you, and they only leave it up for a
certain amount of time. You typically see this
64

65
00:03:15.690 --> 00:03:23.850
when a big account shouts out a smaller one, you also
generally just see it if someone's reposting something
65

66
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.960
from another account that isn't exactly
on brand with the rest of their posts.
66

67
00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:33.020
This is probably the most common one actually you'll
see and it's what most people are open to, because
67

68
00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:34.750
there's no permanent damage
68

69
00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.130
if I post something that just doesn't jive with my group.
69

70
00:03:38.130 --> 00:03:43.710
Those are the hardest to spot because they delete them, so every
time you go to their profile you have no idea how many of these
70

71
00:03:43.710 --> 00:03:44.500
they have done.
71

72
00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:56.960
If you go to the account Foundr, Nathan Chan at
one point was doing close to 6 to 7 of these a day.
72

73
00:03:57.060 --> 00:04:01.660
Okay, he only posts like 5 or 6 times a day,
73

74
00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:06.940
so he was posting more reposts and shoutouts
than he was even posting his own stuff.
74

75
00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:10.880
You can't tell though, because he deletes it all.
Now the second one, permanent shoutouts.
75

76
00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.080
Now, this is a little bit of a more hardcore one, it's
76

77
00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.740
the same thing that we just said before,
but you leave it up permanently.
77

78
00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.250
Now, this is something you see
typically with bigger brands.
78

79
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.060
Bigger brands will do this because they put a lot
more thought into when they repost someone,
79

80
00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:29.720
and you also see it when they're reposting something
that just fits directly into the brand of the account. At
80

81
00:04:29.750 --> 00:04:31.990
Innovation Station, I might do a permanent one
81

82
00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:37.450
if someone made videos in a very similar
fashion to mine and they focused on a gadget.
82

83
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:43.950
I have no problem putting it up permanently. And it's no wonder
that a permanent shoutout is probably the most valuable
83

84
00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:48.690
one and it's probably one of the hardest ones to get. If you can
get a permanent shoutout, good for you, but it's probably going to
84

85
00:04:48.690 --> 00:04:55.000
cost a lot of money, or it's going to require
multiple shoutouts from you, if they're timed, or
85

86
00:04:55.020 --> 00:05:00.730
also another permanent one yourself. Now, next one is a caption
shoutout, and this is probably the weakest of the weak tea,
86

87
00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:07.090
it's when someone posts one of their own photos, has nothing
to do with you, but then they just mention you in the caption.
87

88
00:05:07.460 --> 00:05:14.890
They might do this if they're posting something that's similar to your account, so they might say, "If you like this, you'd like this account."
88

89
00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:19.430
They're not saying "This is from this account"
or "Check them out to see more like this."
89

90
00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:22.410
It's usually kind of a little bit of an awkward thing.
90

91
00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:27.310
The only time I ever see this is, again, when you have
big accounts doing it for really small ones, because
91

92
00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:31.910
they don't want to dedicate an entire post to a small one,
but they might throw you a bone and throw you in the
92

93
00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:36.460
caption, and if you're a small account, getting this
from a big account, it actually could be a big deal.
93

94
00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:39.270
The next type of shoutout is a story
shoutout, and this is pretty simple.
94

95
00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:40.350
The next type of shoutout is a story
shoutout, and this is pretty simple.
95

96
00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:41.780
I mean, you have a story, right?
96

97
00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:44.810
So what you do is you add a little chunk in your story,
97

98
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:47.150
and that is it.
98

99
00:05:47.150 --> 00:05:49.470
You just post to someone else's account.
99

100
00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:51.740
You could say "Follow this person,"
100

101
00:05:51.750 --> 00:05:52.560
that's very common,
101

102
00:05:52.580 --> 00:05:59.140
or you post a chunk from their story or one of their posts,
put it in your story and then say "Follow this person."
102

103
00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.030
This one is one of the most low risk ways of doing it,
because it's only up for a day automatically, you don't
103

104
00:06:05.030 --> 00:06:07.510
even have to remember to go and delete it.
104

105
00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:10.520
It also has limited effectiveness. I mean, it does work and
105

106
00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.390
it's very common, you'll see it, but they
have to then go and type in that name.
106

107
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:18.780
That's not as valuable as someone
doing a post, putting in a caption,
107

108
00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:24.730
lazy people, lazy finger, they just touch it and go to the
account. So once we get into stories, we'll try some of that,
108

109
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:32.570
but it requires a little more maintenance and it's kind of
a mixed bag with regards to, it's a low risk but kind of
109

110
00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:33.840
low reward as well.
110

111
00:06:33.890 --> 00:06:39.520
And then the last ones are paid shoutouts, and I don't have
to explain this one to you - sometimes you just pay for it.
111

112
00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:40.210
And then the last ones are paid shoutouts, and I don't have
to explain this one to you - sometimes you just pay for it.
112

113
00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:44.030
A lot of times you can see a big account and they're
posting something that just makes no sense.
113

114
00:06:44.030 --> 00:06:50.690
Oftentimes, it's just crap that says like "This person is
about to go private in X amount of time" or whatever,
114

115
00:06:50.780 --> 00:06:57.620
and it disappears later, or maybe it's up for like, a day, and
if you go to that account, you do not see a reciprocal one.
115

116
00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.110
Chances are that's a paid shoutout.
116

117
00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:04.800
Now, let's see if we can find a
paid shoutout, it's relatively easy.
117

118
00:07:05.060 --> 00:07:13.220
Let's say we go to an account that
does it all the time, @technology.
118

119
00:07:13.690 --> 00:07:21.620
This idiot has 4.2 million, but you'll notice when they
post stuff that has nothing to do with them at all.
119

120
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.510
OK.
120

121
00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.260
This is a product that's changing weight loss forever.
121

122
00:07:25.310 --> 00:07:29.840
What does that have to do with anything that
they usually cover? Then you look at the bottom,
122

123
00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:30.710
here you go.
123

124
00:07:30.710 --> 00:07:32.710
"Check out this person's account."
124

125
00:07:32.860 --> 00:07:38.140
And if I go here, do you see them posting
anything about technology? No, I don't think so.
125

126
00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:40.550
They purchased that. Also,
126

127
00:07:40.550 --> 00:07:47.500
why in the world would a 5 million follower account
post one with 19,000? Just doesn't make sense.
127

128
00:07:47.550 --> 00:07:50.780
Paid shoutouts are a pretty easy way, if
you have some dough to throw out there,
128

129
00:07:50.780 --> 00:07:52.830
you can definitely get followers.
129

130
00:07:52.890 --> 00:07:59.340
The one caveat I have to say, this is a con to it, is that
often these are accounts with low engagement.
130

131
00:07:59.410 --> 00:08:05.800
When we get into kind of the best practices or how to find
them, I'll talk to you about how you can tell very quickly if
131

132
00:08:05.810 --> 00:08:10.160
they have good engagement and if they have fake followers.
So that's one thing you have to be aware of, some
132

133
00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:17.280
of these accounts are just made in order to sell
shoutouts and sometimes they just... not so much.

What does it cost to buy a paid shoutout?

135
00:08:19.040 --> 00:08:20.120
We'll talk about that later,

00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:23.840
but they can range anywhere from

140
00:08:32.210 --> 00:08:34.930

141
00:08:35.420 --> 00:08:40.870
shoutouts. There are a couple other really obscure
ones, but we'll hit on those a little bit later on.

Otherwise, questions, post in the Slack. See you next lecture.
