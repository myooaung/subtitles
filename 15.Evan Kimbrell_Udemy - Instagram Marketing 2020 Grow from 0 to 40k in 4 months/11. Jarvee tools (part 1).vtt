00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.830
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:07.890
So this lecture we're going to do is we're going to do a bit of a deep dive into the main tools that

3
00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.610
you're going to be setting up for each of your zombies.

4
00:00:10.610 --> 00:00:16.770
We're going to look at the settings that I have for my zombies and then we'll show a quick way that

5
00:00:16.770 --> 00:00:20.460
you can do it for one and then apply it to a bunch of zombies.

6
00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:23.370
So what we're going to do is go to Jarvi go to Tools.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:23.890
OK.

8
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:28.620
Now this is the screen that we've already seen before we have these little toggles where it shows what

9
00:00:28.620 --> 00:00:31.830
functions on each zombie are currently running.

10
00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:37.140
You'll notice that we have blue dots red info's and yellow.

11
00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:41.040
Now what that basically means is a blue means everything's all good.

12
00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.180
Yellow means you are reaching a point where there is a problem.

13
00:00:45.180 --> 00:00:50.610
So a lot of times I've my unfollow but running and Oko yellow and that means well there's actually no

14
00:00:50.610 --> 00:00:51.880
one to follow.

15
00:00:51.890 --> 00:00:57.080
Or maybe my settings are nearing the point where I'm doing too much.

16
00:00:57.180 --> 00:00:59.750
And then red means we've hit some wall.

17
00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:07.560
Either the log in is wrong so you can't run anything or you've hit Instagram's API limits or Jarvi Sometimes

18
00:01:07.560 --> 00:01:09.420
we'll stop you from going too far.

19
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:10.740
So keep that in mind.

20
00:01:10.750 --> 00:01:15.060
Anytime something turns red you just want to go and check it out and see what the problem is.

21
00:01:15.060 --> 00:01:17.170
So for instance this is my main account.

22
00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.040
It says action block this action is blocked.

23
00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:19.650
We try again.

24
00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:22.460
We restrict certain content for the block text or community.

25
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:24.960
Now that's a Jarvi limitation generally.

26
00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:29.910
For some reason doesn't like that I'm doing likes that is probably because somewhere else in my settings

27
00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:31.420
I have likes going.

28
00:01:31.470 --> 00:01:33.180
So typically I would just turn this off.

29
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:35.010
It doesn't seem like it's actually doing anything.

30
00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:40.950
As you can see we have this ratio right here so it'll say zero or zero What this basically means as

31
00:01:40.950 --> 00:01:45.960
the first one is how many actions today has Jarvi run for this.

32
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:49.370
And then the second one is how many should it theoretically run.

33
00:01:49.380 --> 00:01:51.960
Now as we tweak the settings you'll notice these numbers will change.

34
00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:58.500
So with innovations station it says you know I think this might actually be the weekly limit.

35
00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.000
This is something that's clearly off but that's how many follows it should send.

36
00:02:03.180 --> 00:02:06.600
And then this is how many it's done today so it only has a limit.

37
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:10.680
Typically the maximum that you're ever going to hit and this could change depending on when you're walking

38
00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:16.830
the course is about a hundred follows per day and each one of these has different upper bounds for this.

39
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:21.890
Just keep in mind the more you do the more likely Instagram is going to flag you.

40
00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:28.650
So it's really important that you start off by being as conservative as possible and slowly over the

41
00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:29.460
course of months.

42
00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:30.810
Build these up.

43
00:02:30.810 --> 00:02:32.720
Remember we talked about aged accounts.

44
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.770
You have an aged account that can actually help you and that you can skip some of the months of the

45
00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:39.070
warm up period.

46
00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:41.870
But in general you still have to do a warm up period.

47
00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:48.020
So let's go ahead and look at say oh my god technology.

48
00:02:48.060 --> 00:02:49.250
So you just double click it.

49
00:02:49.260 --> 00:02:52.430
Now the follow is the main thing we care about.

50
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:52.960
Right.

51
00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:56.070
We have this thing reposting from my main account.

52
00:02:56.220 --> 00:03:02.170
But the way that we get people to look at it besides hashtags and posting is through the follow bot.

53
00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.050
Now we used to have ask before you're more than welcome to hook up your main account to Jarvi and use

54
00:03:07.050 --> 00:03:08.330
their follow system.

55
00:03:08.370 --> 00:03:11.700
That's actually what I use because I'm already paying for it for the zombies.

56
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:13.980
And also I like their follow system better.

57
00:03:13.980 --> 00:03:15.730
We have more control over it.

58
00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:17.580
Let's look at some of the settings now.

59
00:03:17.790 --> 00:03:21.840
Here's what the settings are not going to go over because they're not really useful only if you are

60
00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:26.370
super advanced to which I don't think you really have a need to do unless you're doing thousands and

61
00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:27.360
thousands of zombies.

62
00:03:27.510 --> 00:03:33.330
OK so right here we have run timers and we have three main settings right here though we have to figure

63
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:38.070
out the first one is wait between blank and blank minutes for each new operation.

64
00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:41.520
Now its keyword this function is the follow function.

65
00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:45.990
So what it does is it goes and finds people that fit within a certain category and it follows them that

66
00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:49.320
notifies that person and there's a good likelihood they follow you back.

67
00:03:49.590 --> 00:03:54.290
Now what I'm doing here is I'm setting a range for each set of operations.

68
00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:57.560
Now an operation is just the system will go OK.

69
00:03:57.570 --> 00:03:59.340
Now it's time to go follow people.

70
00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:03.990
And it might follow one person or might follow a bunch of people but whatever it does all at once it

71
00:04:03.990 --> 00:04:05.220
considers that an operation.

72
00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.830
So it does follow between blank and blank per operation.

73
00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:14.850
So it set up say fall has been four and seven people per operation and that's pretty normal.

74
00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:18.900
You can lower that if you are any more conservative you can raise it it's going to be more aggressive

75
00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:24.720
but you have to go back up here and say every time I do an operation I don't want to just pause and

76
00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:29.490
wait for this range of time before it does the next one because you wouldn't want your thing to just

77
00:04:29.490 --> 00:04:33.680
follow a hundred people all at once that would look extremely strange.

78
00:04:33.690 --> 00:04:39.180
So make sure that you have a range here also because what Jarvi will do is it will look at a number

79
00:04:39.180 --> 00:04:45.060
in between this range so that one operation will wait 15 minutes one operation might wait 19 minutes.

80
00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:50.190
That's good because you don't want it to pause the exact same amount of time every single time.

81
00:04:50.190 --> 00:04:51.160
Humans don't do that.

82
00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:54.670
And that's the whole idea is we're trying to mimic humans.

83
00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.920
Now we have a with a delay between blank and blank seconds between each follow.

84
00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:02.180
Now that's in tween each individual follow within an operation.

85
00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:07.250
So I'm doing four to seven per operation that means I have to wait 30 60 seconds in between each follow.

86
00:05:07.250 --> 00:05:07.870
Right.

87
00:05:07.910 --> 00:05:13.460
So if I'm doing for well it could wait 30 seconds in between each one that ends up being something like

88
00:05:13.460 --> 00:05:14.150
two minutes.

89
00:05:14.150 --> 00:05:15.640
And that's the low end dry.

90
00:05:15.860 --> 00:05:20.390
It's just important that you keep a range here like a healthy range because humans aren't going to follow

91
00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:21.710
follow follow follow follow.

92
00:05:21.710 --> 00:05:23.830
Usually they follow look at the person's account.

93
00:05:23.990 --> 00:05:26.390
Move on to the next one look at another count then follow.

94
00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:30.470
So make sure you have the settings kind of in sync in a way that it actually makes sense.

95
00:05:30.470 --> 00:05:37.490
Now I have execute between 12:45 p.m. and 12:30 a.m. This is up to you if you want to add this to some

96
00:05:37.490 --> 00:05:45.320
people do it and they set it for 12:00 p.m. to 11:59 a.m. and that means it runs all the time.

97
00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:50.210
But keep in mind the goal here is to imitate a human being and human beings do this weird thing called

98
00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.650
sleep.

99
00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:57.440
So it doesn't really make sense that your account is 24/7 on it using it as a normal human wouldn't

100
00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:58.220
do that.

101
00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:00.380
So that's something that we want to avoid.

102
00:06:00.380 --> 00:06:01.800
You can also add an interval.

103
00:06:01.820 --> 00:06:02.480
Right here.

104
00:06:02.510 --> 00:06:09.720
So for instance always stay between 8:00 a.m. and 2:00 a.m. That means that I'm hitting hard parameters

105
00:06:09.720 --> 00:06:15.730
so it's not ever following outside of this right here because that's when I would assume to be asleep.

106
00:06:15.830 --> 00:06:18.720
You'd also do randomize intervals intervals daily.

107
00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:25.010
So what that'll do is it'll change this interval slightly within a 60 minute range every single day.

108
00:06:25.010 --> 00:06:28.560
Again more variety makes you look more human and less like a bot.

109
00:06:28.550 --> 00:06:31.310
So that's another thing I think is pretty important.

110
00:06:31.310 --> 00:06:34.410
You can also add in a random sleep time right here.

111
00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:37.300
If you click that it'll just randomize something.

112
00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:41.580
I don't personally do the random sleep time just because I think it's a little unnecessary and also

113
00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.740
look kind of weird if my account was sleeping during the day one day and then the next day sleeping

114
00:06:45.770 --> 00:06:51.850
during the night and it just never had a consistent pattern where you can use days of the week when

115
00:06:51.920 --> 00:06:52.970
to operate.

116
00:06:52.970 --> 00:06:54.160
You can change that.

117
00:06:54.180 --> 00:06:57.830
You don't want it to work on weekends or only work on weekends.

118
00:06:57.830 --> 00:06:58.960
You can rotate days.

119
00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:04.040
I don't usually play with that again it's just another layer that you can add to make this look more

120
00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.420
human than you can do is increase follow people per operation daily.

121
00:07:07.490 --> 00:07:09.040
That's perfectly fine to do that here.

122
00:07:09.080 --> 00:07:12.460
I prefer to set my limits on this next section right here.

123
00:07:12.470 --> 00:07:13.570
So follow limits.

124
00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.920
Now this is a very important setting.

125
00:07:16.070 --> 00:07:20.610
When you first make this you ought to make sure that your follow maximum is low.

126
00:07:20.750 --> 00:07:25.820
So when I first started doing this there was like 25 to 50 people something like that really really

127
00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:26.540
low.

128
00:07:26.570 --> 00:07:31.940
And then what I did is increase each day with 25 until it reaches a maximum.

129
00:07:31.940 --> 00:07:36.310
Now eight hundred is just generally speaking the max you're ever going to get without him flipping out.

130
00:07:36.330 --> 00:07:37.190
Will they change something.

131
00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:39.770
But right now that's pretty much it.

132
00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:41.230
That's all you can do.

133
00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:47.210
So I had you know 25 to 50 moving up by 25 if I was you to redo these.

134
00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:49.120
I would do them way more conservative.

135
00:07:49.130 --> 00:07:55.190
I would literally start at like 5 to 15 at 10 or 15 until it reaches 18.

136
00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.200
I realize that'll take multiple months but these are long term accounts and it's pretty important to

137
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:03.860
get these off the ground successfully without them just getting bogged down.

138
00:08:03.860 --> 00:08:08.840
Generally speaking skip this enable automatic Calo send or extract their users.

139
00:08:08.840 --> 00:08:11.370
That's just another other advanced technique that you don't need.

140
00:08:11.370 --> 00:08:13.380
Now the next section is user filters.

141
00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.290
Now this is pretty important such that when it does follow people you're hitting people who are most

142
00:08:18.290 --> 00:08:20.280
likely going to follow you back.

143
00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.200
So that's pretty important.

144
00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.570
So we have Skip non-English users users a profile image.

145
00:08:25.580 --> 00:08:29.130
These are a number of posts user BIOS and a number of characters.

146
00:08:29.120 --> 00:08:32.930
Basically we want to make sure that people with all are interested in what we're interested in.

147
00:08:32.940 --> 00:08:38.930
They're active too and they are not a mass follower count because those don't really help us in any

148
00:08:38.930 --> 00:08:39.290
way.

149
00:08:39.290 --> 00:08:43.250
I mean they give us an accurate number and our followers which doesn't give us real users should we

150
00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:43.780
care about.

151
00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:48.170
So I for instance put Skipp non-English users because my posts are English.

152
00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:51.970
It doesn't really make sense to me to have someone who is an entirely different language.

153
00:08:51.980 --> 00:08:57.310
They're not going to enjoy my content so that's something I avoid.

154
00:08:57.330 --> 00:08:58.560
There's a profile image.

155
00:08:58.610 --> 00:09:01.490
Generally speaking if you have a profile image you're probably not active.

156
00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:03.220
So I usually like to skip that.

157
00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:09.380
Also it just looks bad when you have a lot of people who are following you but they don't have a profile

158
00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:09.790
photo.

159
00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:12.810
So it's just kind of a lower quality.

160
00:09:13.130 --> 00:09:15.710
You can also go way more into this.

161
00:09:15.710 --> 00:09:21.080
Make sure that their bio has a certain number of characters are things like they have to contain a certain

162
00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.180
phrase that's the setting you can do.

163
00:09:23.180 --> 00:09:28.550
So for instance I only want people who say technology in their profile to follow me personally haven't

164
00:09:28.550 --> 00:09:31.210
had a lot of success with that so I usually avoid it.

165
00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:37.310
You also do things like there's a follow ratio so you don't want say mass following accounts then what

166
00:09:37.310 --> 00:09:42.230
you can do is say well they can't have a ratio greater than 2 to one or something right the number of

167
00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.930
people they followed to people who follow them has to be within a certain reasonable limit mass following

168
00:09:47.930 --> 00:09:53.090
accounts will have you know 10 times as many followings as they do followers so you can actually avoid

169
00:09:53.090 --> 00:09:54.040
that if you want to.

170
00:09:54.140 --> 00:09:58.680
The next thing is user posted within the last x days I usually do this ones because they didn't post

171
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:03.620
in last 90 days and the not very active so I'm actually just wasting a lot of follows because it also

172
00:10:03.620 --> 00:10:08.030
means that if they have it posted and they're probably not checking their notifications then I have

173
00:10:08.030 --> 00:10:10.450
users not following this account already.

174
00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:15.890
That's good because otherwise you'll go and you'll follow people who have already been converted to

175
00:10:15.890 --> 00:10:20.510
your account so you just want to avoid that because it's spammy and you actually get people to unfollow

176
00:10:20.510 --> 00:10:21.810
you by doing that.

177
00:10:22.050 --> 00:10:24.380
But do not follow private users.

178
00:10:24.650 --> 00:10:25.800
That's up to you.

179
00:10:25.820 --> 00:10:29.390
Just keep in mind private users they have to approve it when you follow them.

180
00:10:29.390 --> 00:10:30.970
So it's just jumping.

181
00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:33.150
I generally avoid.

182
00:10:33.260 --> 00:10:34.880
I don't really have strong feelings about that.

183
00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:35.950
I've tried both.

184
00:10:35.950 --> 00:10:37.850
It doesn't always make a difference.

185
00:10:37.850 --> 00:10:42.140
You can also blacklist specific users if you have people for instance who are putting really bad comments

186
00:10:42.140 --> 00:10:45.990
or something like that I put Skipp business accounts because I want real people following me I don't

187
00:10:46.010 --> 00:10:50.240
really want business accounts following I mean that's not really the audience I'm trying to build but

188
00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:51.440
it depends what you're trying to do.

189
00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:56.570
Honestly if you're a business account Well then getting business accounts to follow you could be important

190
00:10:56.570 --> 00:10:59.620
right especially if you sell like B2B services.

191
00:10:59.690 --> 00:11:01.670
You can do things like Skype accounts with the Web site.

192
00:11:01.670 --> 00:11:03.020
I don't like doing that.

193
00:11:03.030 --> 00:11:07.120
And the idea is just because some accounts might be promoting something.

194
00:11:07.120 --> 00:11:12.410
So those are less likely to be authentic which means that maybe Skepta people have a Web site that saves

195
00:11:12.410 --> 00:11:13.030
you that.

196
00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:17.320
But I've also found that a lot of users who are normal users just have their own Web site.

197
00:11:17.330 --> 00:11:18.430
You know they make their music.

198
00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:19.610
They sell something.

199
00:11:19.610 --> 00:11:20.830
They just have their own site.

200
00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:26.210
OK the rest of it is just you know bloggers and layers of granularity that you really need to know.

201
00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:30.330
You can also do after follow actions so you can do things like.

202
00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:32.540
First thing is to like a user's latest post.

203
00:11:32.540 --> 00:11:35.870
Now keep in mind this is going to run into problems.

204
00:11:35.870 --> 00:11:39.660
You also run like tools on your account.

205
00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:45.230
So just keep that in mind but it's generally a good practice to have it follow someone and then like

206
00:11:45.230 --> 00:11:51.760
maybe two of their photos because that will get their attention more often than just a regular follow.

207
00:11:51.770 --> 00:11:56.230
It also looks more like a human like so when I found your account and they decided to click through.

208
00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:58.680
Now I have the settings set up and like.

209
00:11:58.820 --> 00:12:04.340
So it's not really something that I add but it's perfectly up you you also do things like commenting

210
00:12:04.340 --> 00:12:05.560
on users latest post again.

211
00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.580
Talk about for I don't like commenting so I generally avoid that.

212
00:12:08.610 --> 00:12:10.670
You also do things like send a direct message or follow.

213
00:12:10.670 --> 00:12:16.140
Just keep in mind though that your account could be falling under people and you send 800 direct messages.

214
00:12:16.370 --> 00:12:19.010
That is going to get flagged eventually.

215
00:12:19.010 --> 00:12:22.820
So that's something I wouldn't really try unless you had an account that had been running for a really

216
00:12:22.820 --> 00:12:30.230
long time and even then I would make sure that you set up all the settings so that it really does it

217
00:12:30.230 --> 00:12:31.230
sparingly.

218
00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:34.280
Other stuff you can do is like except pending Reclast.

219
00:12:34.310 --> 00:12:36.950
And this one is actually very important.

220
00:12:36.950 --> 00:12:40.920
And I don't know I actually have it on this one but you want to make sure that you remove poor quality

221
00:12:40.940 --> 00:12:41.660
sources.

222
00:12:41.690 --> 00:12:46.790
Now it's going to pull followers from somewhere and that's how we're going to talk about right next

223
00:12:46.790 --> 00:12:49.830
is here this section called Follow sources.

224
00:12:49.830 --> 00:12:56.240
And so what you want to do is make sure that you're not repeatedly hitting a list that is just not relevant

225
00:12:56.240 --> 00:13:00.350
and you're not getting followers because you're just wasting your time.

226
00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:02.030
It's really an opportunity cost.

227
00:13:02.030 --> 00:13:05.700
So I have removed source that the follow back ratio is lower than point one.

228
00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:06.770
There might be a little aggressive.

229
00:13:06.770 --> 00:13:10.340
But generally speaking if you have a list of people that are very interested what you're doing and your

230
00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:12.780
content is not terrible then.

231
00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:18.270
Point one is actually a pretty good mark to shoot for.

232
00:13:18.280 --> 00:13:23.780
So that would mean that I follow 10 people I expect one person to fall back to follow me that's great.

233
00:13:23.780 --> 00:13:26.060
But if only half a person.

234
00:13:26.130 --> 00:13:30.090
You know like say I fall 20 and only one person called me that below the threshold.

235
00:13:30.290 --> 00:13:33.110
And after a thousand times I did this.

236
00:13:33.140 --> 00:13:37.450
If the ratio is too low I would it would the system automatically just move on to something else.

237
00:13:37.580 --> 00:13:42.580
OK now in next section you follow sources and this is a moment to pick where we get our followers from.

238
00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.090
Now there are different ways to do this.

239
00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:46.620
I like to keep it simple.

240
00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:48.780
But you guys can get as fancy as you want.

241
00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:50.840
You can you follow users by hash tag search.

242
00:13:51.050 --> 00:13:56.840
So what that means is it'll search for a hash tag like say hash tag technology and it'll follow people

243
00:13:57.110 --> 00:14:02.930
who are either posting there or are commenting or follow users there.

244
00:14:02.930 --> 00:14:06.660
Now I think that's too much of a shotgun approach so I just don't do that.

245
00:14:06.690 --> 00:14:08.880
You also do follow by username fullname bile.

246
00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:15.290
That's really more for a specific use case than the one I use the most actually is follow followers

247
00:14:15.290 --> 00:14:16.550
of target accounts.

248
00:14:16.550 --> 00:14:22.850
I find that that is just much easier to piggyback off of if I find someone who posts OT about technology

249
00:14:22.850 --> 00:14:27.860
or gadgets and they're a real authentic account and they've grown over a long period of time then I

250
00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:32.570
would much rather just borrow their list of people knowing that if they like that account they probably

251
00:14:32.570 --> 00:14:33.190
like mine.

252
00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:37.450
So I use some things like inspiring DOS type inventions philosophy of science.

253
00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:42.320
These are just based off of your experience right like philosophy of science have found that the people

254
00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:47.870
following that just like science accounts they're more likely to be real accounts and not bots and then

255
00:14:47.870 --> 00:14:49.190
other ones like hype inventions.

256
00:14:49.190 --> 00:14:55.040
This is probably better for people that are into like viral content but they do like technology so that's

257
00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:55.730
another one.

258
00:14:55.730 --> 00:15:00.530
Now keep in mind if you had your settings such that it removes quality sources you can add as many of

259
00:15:00.530 --> 00:15:01.310
these as you want.

260
00:15:01.310 --> 00:15:06.340
And it'll just automatically cycle through them and figure out which ones are good and keep those in

261
00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:11.350
and get rid of the rest so you don't really have to sit here and curate this list as much as you think.

262
00:15:11.390 --> 00:15:14.340
OK so you can do things like followers of your own followers.

263
00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:19.160
I don't think that's a very good way of doing it just because the followers of your followers don't

264
00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:22.550
necessarily like the same things as civic users.

265
00:15:22.550 --> 00:15:24.950
That's another one you can do follow using geolocation.

266
00:15:24.950 --> 00:15:25.750
That's a great one.

267
00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:31.490
If your business is a like a retail shop or you have a physical location somewhere so you really just

268
00:15:31.490 --> 00:15:36.310
want to go after people in a certain location that actually could be useful use case not for me follow

269
00:15:36.320 --> 00:15:40.080
users that have interactor to post on target accounts that's another one I think is very useful right.

270
00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:46.040
So if I've already decided that philosophy of science has the same type of follower that I want.

271
00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:53.030
Well the people who comment on that are like that or even more likely to like technology or to be active.

272
00:15:53.030 --> 00:15:55.780
So I find that that is a very useful thing.

273
00:15:55.790 --> 00:16:00.200
Typically what I do is I say follow users who commented in the last two thousand eight hundred eighty

274
00:16:00.530 --> 00:16:01.900
minutes.

275
00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:04.790
Correct me if I'm wrong it's in the last like 48 hours.

276
00:16:04.820 --> 00:16:05.060
Right.

277
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:06.540
For whatever reason it makes you do it in minutes.

278
00:16:06.540 --> 00:16:10.850
So just that's that's a good baseline I think 48 hours.

279
00:16:10.850 --> 00:16:14.650
I wouldn't only want to follow people who who post posted last day because maybe they can only post

280
00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:16.780
once a day and don't get that many people.

281
00:16:16.790 --> 00:16:20.590
So that's a pretty good baseline to use.

282
00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:26.000
OK now down here I put you know Gary V Tech virus I really kind of mix it up because I know that this

283
00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:28.580
system will automatically figure it out on its own.

284
00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:33.860
The last one is wrapping up a follow users interaction with posts on target posts so I could upload

285
00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:39.030
a specific post and say I just want people on just who interact with this post not the account.

286
00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:42.600
I find that way too tedious and I have to constantly keep maintaining that.

287
00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:45.160
Follow users attack specific users.

288
00:16:45.530 --> 00:16:46.810
Yeah it's too specific.

289
00:16:46.810 --> 00:16:48.210
Or know these cases there.

290
00:16:48.370 --> 00:16:53.630
And then follows suggested users that relies on the inscription algorithm that constantly suggests people

291
00:16:53.630 --> 00:16:54.480
to follow.

292
00:16:54.530 --> 00:16:58.270
So I again I don't really like to rely on that.

293
00:16:58.370 --> 00:16:59.150
OK so that's it.

294
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:04.550
Past that we have results so this will tell us everyday what has worked.

295
00:17:04.550 --> 00:17:09.500
See will say these are all the people we followed followed followed and says where it got it from.

296
00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:15.740
And then we can see if it's unfollowed them yet and it will say followed back eventually once you find

297
00:17:15.740 --> 00:17:16.200
someone.

298
00:17:16.250 --> 00:17:23.040
You know I have 200 pages of this and these are all I have been running today so it's not super common

299
00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:26.460
that people fall you immediately so who I create here it says followed back.

300
00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:30.050
So that's why I keeping track to make sure something's not awry.

301
00:17:30.050 --> 00:17:35.660
The last thing is extracted users which if you are using user based targeting than it will tell you

302
00:17:35.660 --> 00:17:37.790
these are the ones that it's specifically going after.

303
00:17:37.790 --> 00:17:43.630
OK guys next lecture we're going to talk about liking and commenting and following back.

304
00:17:43.730 --> 00:17:44.140
OK.

305
00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:44.760
See you then.
