00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:01,510
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,550
OK so we are on day.

3
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:08,090
I want to say 21 or 22 something like that.

4
00:00:08,230 --> 00:00:10,260
I might have lost track of that.

5
00:00:10,530 --> 00:00:17,040
Anyway so just checking in to tell you what I've done so far in the last three days I want to say OK

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:23,510
so as you can see we have 157 posts and about fifty nine hundred followers.

7
00:00:23,520 --> 00:00:26,280
Give or take following still pretty loud about a thousand.

8
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:34,800
So first off what I have done is I've recently switched entirely to posting during the U.S. space times.

9
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,280
Now that's just part of the content strategy.

10
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:44,880
I want to focus my followers in one general time zone region and then also I just think that U.S. based

11
00:00:45,540 --> 00:00:49,840
accounts are going to be more valuable later when I try to monetize.

12
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,570
And also just probably more interested in what I'm posting.

13
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,560
There's also English base so that also makes sense.

14
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:02,770
So the way I've done that was by working with someone I think it was South Carolina.

15
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:03,870
Don't call me on that.

16
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:09,680
But anyway she has taken over posting from the original person who was in charge of posting.

17
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:12,580
We're still doing everything in later.

18
00:01:12,830 --> 00:01:17,790
So but what's happening now is you know I'm in a different time zone so I don't actually see a lot of

19
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:23,650
the posting it actually happens all the sleep but it's pretty easy so let's see.

20
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:23,890
OK.

21
00:01:23,910 --> 00:01:24,250
Yeah.

22
00:01:24,300 --> 00:01:32,580
So I'll start posting at 5 o'clock my time and then it goes away to 3am which is you know I'm asleep

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:33,520
at that point.

24
00:01:33,870 --> 00:01:37,240
But that lines up pretty well with the US.

25
00:01:37,400 --> 00:01:43,060
So yeah I mean we've seen a decent change and engagement just from that.

26
00:01:43,250 --> 00:01:48,060
Here's a look at my iconv square I can also see that I'm getting increases in the U.S. based audience

27
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:54,060
versus say other ones that are you know like Middle East or India or China or things like that.

28
00:01:54,090 --> 00:01:56,630
I guess I said China I don't know even if they block it.

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,220
And then let's see other than that what I've started doing is I started doing that weekly carrousel

30
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:03,320
post.

31
00:02:03,330 --> 00:02:05,060
Now you remember this from before.

32
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:11,450
The idea was to look at the last week and choose which of those performed the best.

33
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:19,500
And I was just going off of engagement so let's see last week we posted let's use this one and always

34
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,670
pick the one that has the most interesting thumbnail to run as the first video.

35
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:32,550
So we post these in class the bones the 3-D pedestrian walkway and then kind of the idea was that I

36
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:34,170
would every week post that.

37
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,650
It's an extra piece of content and then hopefully we can try to promote it.

38
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:46,470
So we're trying to do this year this week was post this one and I tried promoting it by working with

39
00:02:46,470 --> 00:02:48,450
one of the other people.

40
00:02:48,470 --> 00:02:50,250
It was Grann a tax account.

41
00:02:50,490 --> 00:02:56,340
And so we tried to promote this one but it didn't really work out just because of some errors but you

42
00:02:56,340 --> 00:03:02,970
could still see that the insights we still had working on are like 21:00 close to 22:00 engagement which

43
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:05,720
is much much better than say like the average post.

44
00:03:05,730 --> 00:03:07,480
So it took an average post.

45
00:03:07,910 --> 00:03:10,250
Ok actually this one did really poorly.

46
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:14,860
So you see your average is like 150.

47
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,610
OK.

48
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:23,040
So what I did for that was we just kind of had a deal before that if I paid them originally was $10

49
00:03:23,060 --> 00:03:26,520
but now they opted to $30 they would promote it like that.

50
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:28,320
And for me it's just an experiment.

51
00:03:28,320 --> 00:03:30,930
So why not will I do it next week.

52
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:31,810
Probably not.

53
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,480
I'll still do the carousel posts because those perform really well but I don't think I'll pay to have

54
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,050
this boosted anymore.

55
00:03:38,160 --> 00:03:40,190
It also seems that we kind of screwed it up.

56
00:03:40,220 --> 00:03:44,760
We didn't do it the way that he wanted to because he wanted to make sure we only did one video and then

57
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:46,620
picked one with a better thumbnail.

58
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:54,630
And the reason why is because when you do carousels it doesn't show right on the front views.

59
00:03:54,630 --> 00:04:02,090
Instead it shows likes Now that then becomes the way the hash tag pages and explore pages.

60
00:04:02,140 --> 00:04:03,480
It's going to get ranked.

61
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,360
So that's the primary engagement indicator.

62
00:04:06,660 --> 00:04:08,330
I kind of was aware of that.

63
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:11,090
I just didn't really think it made much of a difference.

64
00:04:11,100 --> 00:04:16,450
I don't even know 100 percent if that's what went wrong but that's kind of what their complaint was.

65
00:04:16,650 --> 00:04:19,120
I'm going to put all of these conversations and the resources.

66
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:23,230
You can read these whenever you want to just to see kind of what worked and what didn't.

67
00:04:23,310 --> 00:04:31,110
OK so other than that we started doing what's called like exchange and also I started kind of fanning

68
00:04:31,110 --> 00:04:33,470
out the zombie strategy.

69
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:37,010
So if we look on the computer case it will go to Jarvi.

70
00:04:37,050 --> 00:04:44,320
And so what you can see is I've actually created about five zombies and I've also added the main account

71
00:04:44,380 --> 00:04:45,030
Jarvi.

72
00:04:45,030 --> 00:04:51,270
Now I want to start integrating the main account into Jarvi because pop social was the system I was

73
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:56,480
using for doing the auto follow bots and they're just not doing a great job.

74
00:04:56,480 --> 00:05:01,030
I'm not particularly happy with that for the price you pay just doesn't really sense Charlie seems to

75
00:05:01,030 --> 00:05:02,160
be a lot better.

76
00:05:02,170 --> 00:05:07,810
So I'm going to switch to that and then slowly start to ramp up that again for innovation station.

77
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:12,130
But as you can see over here these are the ones that I started creating the ones with the names of the

78
00:05:12,130 --> 00:05:16,660
ones that have actually started setting up now newest intact.

79
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:20,070
One thing show us and this one is actually doing pretty well.

80
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:28,150
And the way I set it up is I just have it posting the same stuff from innovations station that's all

81
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:33,910
it's doing is just picking posts that innovation station has and then setting it so that it only posts

82
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,240
things that have higher than average engagement.

83
00:05:37,510 --> 00:05:39,550
And so so far it's doing fine.

84
00:05:39,550 --> 00:05:44,110
I mean it's got 130 followers and I started this about 36 hours ago.

85
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:46,850
So it's actually growing faster than the main account.

86
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:48,250
So that's perfectly fine.

87
00:05:48,250 --> 00:05:52,330
It's got a terrible ratio of following your followers but I don't care it's a zombie that's the whole

88
00:05:52,330 --> 00:05:57,370
idea behind this is that you just do this in volume and then you can see very clearly that every single

89
00:05:57,370 --> 00:06:00,310
time I post something you have innovation sation bottom right.

90
00:06:00,310 --> 00:06:04,220
And then we have obviously the end cap video that says follow innovation station.

91
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,560
But then also we have it at the bottom pretty much everywhere.

92
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:09,110
We can take a peek at the settings that I was using.

93
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:15,810
So I go to Tools all I'm pretty much doing with these two right here.

94
00:06:15,820 --> 00:06:22,120
My God technology and tomorrow technology is just reposting and once you get to say like 15 posts then

95
00:06:22,120 --> 00:06:24,730
I'll start turning on followers and likes.

96
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:29,280
So the settings I have here are pretty straightforward.

97
00:06:29,290 --> 00:06:37,510
Just on the reposte section I have it posting something like say 7 a day or something like that.

98
00:06:37,510 --> 00:06:39,940
So it says 32 posts a day but that's not true.

99
00:06:39,940 --> 00:06:45,640
So it posted here between 7 and 15 a day repost and it's all pulling images or videos.

100
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:51,080
I said don't obviously repo's done English go for ones that have 30 percent higher than the average.

101
00:06:51,100 --> 00:06:56,760
So that's why you see these ones on here are just more of the popular ones.

102
00:06:57,010 --> 00:06:59,450
And it's only posting from that account.

103
00:06:59,470 --> 00:07:04,270
Now also what I did was I because this is a brand new account I know engagement's can be low.

104
00:07:04,270 --> 00:07:13,450
So what I did is I went to the master hash tag list that I had created for my other main account and

105
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:20,200
I just started pulling a lot of tags that are on the lower end so the ones that are very unpopular let's

106
00:07:20,200 --> 00:07:23,770
just say that so better chance of ranking in those.

107
00:07:23,770 --> 00:07:25,710
That was my idea behind it.

108
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:31,540
Really all I did is just pulled like 100 of them and then plugged them into Jarvi suggested hashtags

109
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:32,330
tool.

110
00:07:32,470 --> 00:07:36,800
And then from that kind of went through and picked out the ones that are wrong.

111
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:40,780
There's tons of wrong ones but that's kind of how I put that together.

112
00:07:40,810 --> 00:07:42,500
So you can see it here on this list.

113
00:07:42,660 --> 00:07:46,250
I started the top where we have like five million posts per hash tag.

114
00:07:46,450 --> 00:07:48,500
I was pulling them all the way at the bottom here.

115
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:53,320
These ones like they started at the lowest one I think had like 2000.

116
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:56,580
And then went all the way up to I think like 25000.

117
00:07:56,590 --> 00:07:59,000
So now they're at 32000.

118
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,240
So that's what we're starting with.

119
00:08:00,250 --> 00:08:06,960
And then over time as the average engagement goes up I will switch out and start putting in higher or

120
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,060
just larger more popular hashtags.

121
00:08:09,070 --> 00:08:14,280
The syntax I'm using is just simple it's just taking the original post without hashtags because I occasionally

122
00:08:14,290 --> 00:08:19,350
put hash tags in the caption then comment meaning anything after this go in a comment.

123
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:21,980
Then I put original post hash tags.

124
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:26,070
So what happens is I did this plus enabled dynamic hash tags.

125
00:08:26,500 --> 00:08:31,600
So it ends up happening is sometimes it posts the original ones and then sometimes it posts these and

126
00:08:31,600 --> 00:08:34,040
it picks 50 50 from here 22 to 30.

127
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:38,140
But typically it's going to pull from here because these are the small ones and it's sometimes that

128
00:08:38,140 --> 00:08:41,070
does this general is not it doesn't work 100 percent of times.

129
00:08:41,070 --> 00:08:42,500
You'll notice this pretty quickly.

130
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:44,330
Like look at some of the older posts.

131
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,260
They just all came out wrong so like this has no hash tags no comment anything really.

132
00:08:49,330 --> 00:08:50,970
So this one worked out fine.

133
00:08:51,010 --> 00:08:53,320
Looks like it probably pulled.

134
00:08:53,380 --> 00:08:55,840
Now I saw it pulled from the new list.

135
00:08:55,900 --> 00:09:00,640
So anyway they don't always work the same you just kind of tweak it sometimes it makes sense the way

136
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,880
you set them up but you just got to get to a point where it works.

137
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:07,310
And then I have follows and I think likes set up.

138
00:09:07,420 --> 00:09:12,830
Now the other thing that I've started doing is a new tool actually through Jarvi which is like exchanges.

139
00:09:12,910 --> 00:09:16,650
And we talked earlier in the actual course about like exchanges and the different ways of doing it.

140
00:09:16,660 --> 00:09:19,900
But so far this is probably the easiest way of doing it.

141
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:21,220
It does cost extra.

142
00:09:21,220 --> 00:09:26,140
They haven't announced how much extra cost but I'm guessing it's probably going to be like $5 a month

143
00:09:26,140 --> 00:09:27,640
or something.

144
00:09:27,640 --> 00:09:34,990
So the way this works is you just upload accounts that will every 30 minutes like other posts that are

145
00:09:34,990 --> 00:09:36,950
from counts in their system.

146
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:42,570
And so what I did is I put my zombies up here and said OK they can like up to 300 a day 20 per session.

147
00:09:42,580 --> 00:09:43,440
Great.

148
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:49,390
And then that essentially earns me currency that then other people will like my main account.

149
00:09:49,420 --> 00:09:53,570
So I don't want likes going back to the zombies is not really what I'm trying to optimize.

150
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:59,020
I'm just trying to use them to get some favor or to point them towards innovation station where we can

151
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:04,130
notice pretty quick that some of these posts actually have a lot of engagement.

152
00:10:04,250 --> 00:10:06,980
So you know there's 3300.

153
00:10:06,980 --> 00:10:13,220
This is not a boosted post but you can see 684 likes like that's where it's coming from primarily then

154
00:10:13,220 --> 00:10:15,580
that's from the engagement group.

155
00:10:15,590 --> 00:10:18,860
Now whether or not you guys use engagement groups up to you.

156
00:10:18,860 --> 00:10:22,640
I use everything that's out there and if it works I keep going with it.

157
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:23,730
Otherwise I move on.

158
00:10:23,750 --> 00:10:24,810
It's really up to you.

159
00:10:24,890 --> 00:10:26,860
The engagement groups are perfectly fine.

160
00:10:26,900 --> 00:10:30,220
The likes you get are real there are real accounts.

161
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:36,920
So you don't really have too much of an issue of you know making Instagram angry but it does definitely

162
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:39,230
screw up your analytics.

163
00:10:39,230 --> 00:10:45,920
So when I look back at my systems it can be a lot more confusing just because all of a sudden I went

164
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:47,960
from getting average 100 likes.

165
00:10:47,960 --> 00:10:53,190
Now I'm getting like average 600 to 700 so it just kind of had to keep that in mind.

166
00:10:53,510 --> 00:10:59,900
Hopefully if I keep doing this like exchange then it will start to normalize and I'll know I have a

167
00:10:59,900 --> 00:11:02,850
better sense of what's relatively doing well.

168
00:11:02,910 --> 00:11:08,740
OK so other than that what I have done is I just for the hell of it decided why not.

169
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:13,070
I'm going to try doing a paid promotion with a really really big account.

170
00:11:13,070 --> 00:11:20,870
So what I did is I went to the biggest count I knew and that was finest inventions and they have about

171
00:11:20,870 --> 00:11:22,130
11 million.

172
00:11:22,370 --> 00:11:24,360
And unfortunately they're private.

173
00:11:24,410 --> 00:11:32,210
So I couldn't actually do an analysis on the account itself but I just decided to reach out to them

174
00:11:32,210 --> 00:11:39,080
because they listed their kick escaped hell basically in their account and then I just looked at similar

175
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:45,280
ones to them and the similar ones to them all do the same thing with all the big ones.

176
00:11:45,280 --> 00:11:48,610
Post their kik in their bio.

177
00:11:48,660 --> 00:11:52,640
And the reason I think is just because these are older accounts if you get to 11 million you've been

178
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:54,530
probably doing this for six years.

179
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:57,050
So they're pretty old school and that's how they communicate.

180
00:11:57,050 --> 00:12:03,170
So I just went on kik and his message to a whole bunch of them and it's you know half them responded

181
00:12:03,560 --> 00:12:08,390
and of the half responded then I actually went down the process with them.

182
00:12:08,390 --> 00:12:11,820
So like DIY Furius has 4.2 million.

183
00:12:12,050 --> 00:12:14,890
And this actually didn't work out very well for me.

184
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:23,210
So I used a story promotion that we had before but then we cut it up so it wasn't the same format as

185
00:12:24,860 --> 00:12:29,630
an actual story because stories are portraits whereas Instagram posts themselves ideally or square.

186
00:12:29,630 --> 00:12:36,800
So we just took that old version and turned it into as you can see a square version.

187
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:43,520
It's the same length all we did of the change the cap that called the action and made it simpler.

188
00:12:43,520 --> 00:12:48,630
So as opposed to being 15 seconds which I just thought was too much.

189
00:12:48,850 --> 00:12:52,550
It would just basically encourage people not to watch the entire thing.

190
00:12:52,550 --> 00:12:54,410
I just made it something like five seconds.

191
00:12:54,410 --> 00:12:56,790
So there you go and then it's done.

192
00:12:56,810 --> 00:12:59,940
Now if I could redo that one I would simplify the call to action but whatever.

193
00:12:59,940 --> 00:13:04,190
So we tried that with D.I.Y. furious and it just didn't really work out very well.

194
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,620
I think I paid them.

195
00:13:05,780 --> 00:13:11,840
I want to say a hundred bucks something like that and gave them this caption and it just didn't really

196
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:12,250
work out.

197
00:13:12,260 --> 00:13:17,090
So what I did is I picked top five facts of the day and I just picked five facts that were the most

198
00:13:17,090 --> 00:13:19,230
interesting to me out of my entire list.

199
00:13:19,250 --> 00:13:24,360
I just went through my quote posts and just looked at them and said OK these are interesting.

200
00:13:24,410 --> 00:13:28,070
Like for instance Steve Jobs I mean the company Apple because he was a fruitarian when he did it.

201
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:29,740
Facebook's dominant colors blue.

202
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:32,670
Because Mark Zuckerberg is colorblind.

203
00:13:32,750 --> 00:13:37,460
For instance I was fascinated 97 percent of the e-mails sent in the world are spam.

204
00:13:37,460 --> 00:13:39,770
So anyway I put that there and it didn't work out.

205
00:13:39,810 --> 00:13:44,240
I guess it's probably because of my caption was too complicated and that just didn't result in a lot

206
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,340
of people clicking through.

207
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:53,180
But yeah I mean that's my guess because it got a lot of engagement on their account it just didn't result

208
00:13:53,180 --> 00:13:54,290
in a lot of followers.

209
00:13:54,290 --> 00:13:59,630
So what I'm doing was I just said OK skirt and I'll just pay a lot of money for a really really big

210
00:13:59,630 --> 00:14:00,000
account.

211
00:14:00,020 --> 00:14:02,030
And you guys don't have to do this remember.

212
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:04,680
Like I don't suggest doing this.

213
00:14:04,730 --> 00:14:07,550
I just wanted to do it so I can show you how this works.

214
00:14:07,550 --> 00:14:13,640
Like if if you were to go and you want to have an 11 million person account promote you how you would

215
00:14:13,640 --> 00:14:17,070
do it and this is what it will look like and this one is quite expensive.

216
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,830
So end you're paying $300.

217
00:14:19,910 --> 00:14:22,340
He's got the wrong guys.

218
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:23,690
Yeah $300.

219
00:14:23,690 --> 00:14:27,460
And this guy was incredibly difficult to communicate with.

220
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:29,740
He would just disappear for like two days at a time.

221
00:14:29,780 --> 00:14:31,200
He's supposed to go on a Friday.

222
00:14:31,280 --> 00:14:33,210
Disappeared so supposedly Saturday.

223
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:35,750
Disappeared eventually posted on a Monday.

224
00:14:35,750 --> 00:14:37,250
So whatever.

225
00:14:37,250 --> 00:14:39,740
But it did end up working out pretty well.

226
00:14:39,770 --> 00:14:47,330
And the reason why is you can just see pretty quickly if we were to look at our stats it I think it

227
00:14:47,330 --> 00:14:49,250
added about 2200 followers.

228
00:14:49,250 --> 00:14:51,580
So that's that's decent.

229
00:14:51,620 --> 00:14:55,110
That's probably the most return I've ever gotten from a paid promotion.

230
00:14:55,370 --> 00:15:00,270
And just from a dollar value that means that per dollar it's getting like for followers which is pretty

231
00:15:00,270 --> 00:15:05,600
expensive if you're trying to run this organically you're not you know trying to actually pay money.

232
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:11,160
But as far as paid promotions go that's actually fine.

233
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:18,680
I probably am going to transition out of OK so iconic square doesn't update for whatever reason.

234
00:15:18,690 --> 00:15:24,910
See if we can find on the web I guess you can see here that there's just a big uptick you know is growing

235
00:15:24,920 --> 00:15:32,470
at pretty much anywhere from 30 to 90 a day something like that probably average out about 50 a day.

236
00:15:33,240 --> 00:15:36,560
But would end up having forty five hundred.

237
00:15:36,990 --> 00:15:39,140
And then we ended up at 50 800.

238
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:44,400
So I discount that by about two to three hundred because that's how we would have naturally grown.

239
00:15:44,410 --> 00:15:48,530
But yeah you can clearly see that you know it gave us at least a thousand followers.

240
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:50,160
So that's I'd say that's good.

241
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:51,180
Would I do it again.

242
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:55,610
No because I don't want to keep doing paid promotions and I'm not going to.

243
00:15:55,890 --> 00:15:58,290
I just want to see how it works so now we know.

244
00:15:58,310 --> 00:15:58,590
Right.

245
00:15:58,620 --> 00:16:03,060
This is what should happen when you do larger paid promotions.

246
00:16:03,060 --> 00:16:08,280
They're probably more worth it then say medium sized ones as you've noticed a lot of times I'll pay

247
00:16:08,280 --> 00:16:09,720
a medium size $150.

248
00:16:09,740 --> 00:16:13,660
But it doesn't give me anything you know only gives me like 80 followers.

249
00:16:13,710 --> 00:16:15,280
So I mean you just do the math on that.

250
00:16:15,280 --> 00:16:19,200
That's just not really the same like some of the mediums will give me two followers per dollar.

251
00:16:19,210 --> 00:16:21,650
That's what got me close to about four followers per dollar.

252
00:16:21,660 --> 00:16:24,090
So that's perfectly fine.

253
00:16:24,450 --> 00:16:28,760
Now what I mean to do is kind of start transitioning into using my zombies to do promo promotions.

254
00:16:28,920 --> 00:16:36,930
The only other thing I started doing is I've started looking at accounts to buy and this is part of

255
00:16:36,990 --> 00:16:37,810
the course.

256
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:42,300
So if you go back to that section we cover a little bit of buying accounts and the way that that works

257
00:16:42,810 --> 00:16:45,410
well when you buy accounts it's pretty simple.

258
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:49,970
I mean you just find an account that's similar enough that already has an audience built out.

259
00:16:49,980 --> 00:16:54,960
Some of them are really cheap so you can get one for I don't know spend a hundred bucks you can probably

260
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:57,320
get one that has 20000 followers or something like that.

261
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:04,920
And then what you would do is just look for something that you can easily keep posting on and then just

262
00:17:04,920 --> 00:17:08,130
use it as a advertising platform for your main account.

263
00:17:08,130 --> 00:17:12,840
It's like basically buying a shout out except you buy the entire account so you can shout yourself out

264
00:17:12,840 --> 00:17:14,780
pretty much every single day.

265
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,150
And once I do that I'll show you what my strategy is.

266
00:17:18,150 --> 00:17:23,460
One thing I'm struggling with is just finding technology based accounts for sale for whatever reason

267
00:17:23,460 --> 00:17:29,670
the people who sell accounts only like to sell things that are like fitness models or like bodybuilding

268
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:34,320
or cats and animals or humor and memes and things like that.

269
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:40,410
So anyway I want to try to find one and when I do I'll show you where I found it how much I paid and

270
00:17:40,410 --> 00:17:45,210
then I'll show you what my strategy is for basically taking all of its followers and trying to get it

271
00:17:45,210 --> 00:17:47,410
to go to my main account anyway.

272
00:17:47,450 --> 00:17:53,100
So yeah doing it for science doing it for you guys so you can learn and see how this works.

273
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:54,990
OK so I'll check back in.

274
00:17:54,990 --> 00:17:57,250
I'm moving on to Malta.

275
00:17:57,420 --> 00:18:02,250
And so you probably won't hear from me from at least two to three days but then I'll check in and you'll

276
00:18:02,250 --> 00:18:03,010
see where we're at.

277
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,450
All right.

278
00:18:03,450 --> 00:18:03,900
Thanks guys.

279
00:18:03,900 --> 00:18:04,110
Later.
