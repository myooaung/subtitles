Hey guys, welcome back.

00:00:00,930 --> 00:00:01,920
Hey guys, welcome back.
2

3
00:00:02,010 --> 00:00:09,050
OK, this lecture we're going to talk about a really easy
optimization for your posting, especially at first,
3

4
00:00:09,390 --> 00:00:11,630
and that is picking the right time to post.
4

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:20,190
Now, everything we do is about optimization. An unoptimized
account on Instagram will grow, and chances
5

6
00:00:20,190 --> 00:00:22,760
are you've seen accounts that do everything wrong, you 
6

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:27,330
pretty much see the opposite of what we're talking
about in this course, and they still have followers.
7

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:28,470
That's fine.
8

9
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:34,950
They will grow, but they won't grow very fast, or at least
they won't grow as fast as they could if they chose
9

10
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:38,570
to do the right things, or at least optimize something.
10

11
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:43,020
And one of those ways to ensure you grow a little bit faster
is to make sure that you're posting at the right time.
11

12
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:44,160
And one of those ways to ensure you grow a little bit faster
is to make sure that you're posting at the right time.
12

13
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,310
We've already talked about what stuff to post, but we
haven't talked about when to post during the month,
13

14
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:52,160
during the week, and during the day.
14

15
00:00:52,290 --> 00:00:57,960
You might not have thought that this makes much of a difference to you and your Instagram strategy, and I honestly
15

16
00:00:57,960 --> 00:00:58,830
don't blame you.
16

17
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:04,260
I never would've thought this really makes a huge difference, especially if you have an international community
17

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:05,130
of followers, you would assume that posting at midnight is fine because it's, you know, noon somewhere. And well, it actually
18

19
00:01:05,150 --> 00:01:11,250
of followers, you would assume that posting at midnight is fine because it's, you know, noon somewhere. And well, it actually
19

20
00:01:11,250 --> 00:01:13,140
makes a significant difference.
20

21
00:01:13,150 --> 00:01:14,970
It's not game changing.
21

22
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,670
It's not going to turn your account upside down,
22

23
00:01:17,790 --> 00:01:20,060
but it can make a pretty decent boost.
23

24
00:01:20,190 --> 00:01:21,890
I mean, generally when we see people use an
24

25
00:01:21,910 --> 00:01:27,120
optimized posting strategy, they get something
like 20% to 30% more engagement.
25

26
00:01:27,120 --> 00:01:33,150
Now, first we need to preface this with asking, when
we're saying when do we want to post during the day,
26

27
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:37,870
what do we care about the most?
Do we care about when people are on it?
27

28
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,760
Do we want times when the posting
is lowest so it's less saturated?
28

29
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:45,600
Do we want the times when people engage the most?
29

30
00:01:45,780 --> 00:01:47,460
Well, I'll just tell you right upfront.
30

31
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,840
Primarily we care about when people engage
and then secondarily we care about
31

32
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,510
when are people on the platform.
32

33
00:01:54,630 --> 00:01:58,100
And luckily those two things overlap for the most part.
33

34
00:01:58,160 --> 00:01:59,340
So you can think to yourself,
34

35
00:01:59,400 --> 00:02:04,730
when is it the case that during the week a lot of people
are on Instagram but they're not engaging, they're
35

36
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,050
not liking, they're not following, they're not commenting?
36

37
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:11,240
Well, if you guessed "during work,"
that's a pretty good guess actually.
37

38
00:02:11,240 --> 00:02:12,480
We see that a lot.
38

39
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:18,600
So especially, say, East Coast time zone in the U.S.,
you'll notice that people who have accounts over there
39

40
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:23,590
look at a lot of things, but they don't spend
a lot of time clicking or commenting.
40

41
00:02:23,610 --> 00:02:28,740
So it's kind of like, they're just looking down at their
phone and screwing with it in a meeting and
41

42
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:31,620
they're not using their fingers yet because
they're not really committed to it.
42

43
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,460
Now, the opposite would be, say, during a commute.
43

44
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:37,460
So we notice that right before the 9 to 5 period,
44

45
00:02:37,590 --> 00:02:42,310
you see a lot of people engaging
and a medium amount of people on it.
45

46
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,960
It depends if you drive, it kind of depends if you
have to do work before you show up at work.
46

47
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:53,100
Now, the other thing I want to say is that picking the
best time based off of the general population of
47

48
00:02:53,110 --> 00:03:01,110
Instagram is good, but it's not as good as picking the
best times based off of your audience specifically.
48

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:08,970
Your audience is the most relevant and the variation in when people post and when they engage for your audience
49

50
00:03:08,970 --> 00:03:11,860
is going to be stronger than the general population.
50

51
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,570
Later on, we'll use some of the tools that we
actually previously signed up with, remember
51

52
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:19,150
we talked about Iconosquare and Social Rank.
52

53
00:03:19,350 --> 00:03:22,330
We'll use those to figure out our audience,
53

54
00:03:22,340 --> 00:03:26,520
when are they on, because that often deviates from the norm,
54

55
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:31,170
but for the most part now the rule of thumb, at least
in the first month of posting, is that we're going to
55

56
00:03:31,170 --> 00:03:37,680
stick to the general population guidelines. So with
that being said, let's start with the first graph
56

57
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,740
that we need to pay attention to,
and that is days of the week.
57

58
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:43,350
Now, there's not really a big difference here.
58

59
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:48,960
What you'll notice is on Monday people engage less, probably that's something to do with that whole work thing, probably
59

60
00:03:48,960 --> 00:03:52,870
focused on work, they're not really
in the weekend mentality yet.
60

61
00:03:52,890 --> 00:03:58,370
And, for whatever reason, Wednesdays
are the days that people engage the most.
61

62
00:03:58,380 --> 00:04:04,110
But we will notice that the variation between
these, 4.4 to 4.9 is just not really that big.
62

63
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:04,820
But we will notice that the variation between
these, 4.4 to 4.9 is just not really that big.
63

64
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:07,570
And this is the average number of engagements per post.
64

65
00:04:07,590 --> 00:04:09,820
It's just, that's not a big jump.
65

66
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,920
That's really only something like a 10% difference.
66

67
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:16,340
So it's not something that I think you really
need to spend a lot of time thinking about.
67

68
00:04:16,350 --> 00:04:20,760
But if for some reason you have to choose between posting
on a Monday or posting on a Wednesday, you post
68

69
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:28,110
on a Wednesday. Now, the next graph is a lot more relevant
to us, and that is the 24-hour graph, showing when
69

70
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:34,170
throughout the day people post, and this is way more important, because you'll notice the variation is quite a bit bigger.
70

71
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:35,230
throughout the day people post, and this is way more important, because you'll notice the variation is quite a bit bigger.
71

72
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:44,640
You notice that the worst time to post is at 9:00 AM,
with the second worst time being around 6-ish PM, and
72

73
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:53,510
the best times to post, actually it's a tie between 2:00 AM and 5:00 PM, and then the runner up to best time is around 10:00 PM.
73

74
00:04:53,530 --> 00:04:55,290
the best times to post, actually it's a tie between 2:00 AM and 5:00 PM, and then the runner up to best time is around 10:00 PM.
74

75
00:04:55,310 --> 00:05:01,580
Now, what you'll notice between the lowest minimum
and the highest maximum is the difference is about 1.2.
75

76
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:03,180
So that's actually a difference close to about 29%.
76

77
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:05,300
So that's actually a difference close to about 29%.
77

78
00:05:05,310 --> 00:05:10,050
So if you post during the correct time,
you could theoretically have 29% more,
78

79
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:12,380
couple that with posting on the right day,
79

80
00:05:12,420 --> 00:05:16,960
it could almost be like 39% more.
What's interesting to take into account
80

81
00:05:17,050 --> 00:05:23,220
is just looking at this and then trying to guess why it is
that it spikes at 2:00 AM, 5:00 PM, and then 10:00 PM,
81

82
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:25,100
and I'll let you guess,
82

83
00:05:25,140 --> 00:05:27,360
but for the most part it's just downtime.
83

84
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:32,540
This is something you'll notice, people usually get off
work at 5:00 PM, so they probably have some downtime
84

85
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,730
right at the end of the day, they're probably checking in to see maybe what's something to do later on that day, probably
85

86
00:05:38,730 --> 00:05:45,210
clearing through messages or DMs that they have,
at 10:00 PM it's kind of that weird twilight zone
86

87
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:50,990
where you've done pretty much everything you need, you're
done with dinner, and now you have this blank bit of time
87

88
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,160
before you go to bed, and then
88

89
00:05:52,200 --> 00:05:55,870

90
2:00 AM also is just for people
who stay up late, can't sleep,
89

91
00:05:56,010 --> 00:05:59,900
that's often a time that they'll browse. Now, the local minimums
90

92
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:06,120
we have that 9:00 AM, and then that 6:00 PM, so the 9:00
AM is probably because that's right when work starts,
91

93
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:06,660
we have that 9:00 AM, and then that 6:00 PM, so the 9:00
AM is probably because that's right when work starts,
92

94
00:06:06,660 --> 00:06:12,520
so people probably are going to try to focus,
it doesn't really make sense right
93

95
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:15,480
when the bell starts for work, you're on Instagram.
94

96
00:06:15,630 --> 00:06:22,440
And then 6:00 PM, you know, that kind of, it's probably
a rebound from using it at 5:00 PM, and then
95

97
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:28,080
you're not using it at 6:00, because I don't know who sits on Instagram for two hours from 5:00 to 7:00. From 7:00 to 9:00,
96

98
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:28,810
you're not using it at 6:00, because I don't know who sits on Instagram for two hours from 5:00 to 7:00. From 7:00 to 9:00,
97

99
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,470
you notice that it slowly starts to rise and that's
really because people are going into dinner, and
98

100
00:06:34,470 --> 00:06:35,930
that's not when they're not going to be using it,
99

101
00:06:35,940 --> 00:06:41,700
but as people, earlier eaters start
finishing around 8:00 and then 8:30,
100

102
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:44,790
you see it starts to tick up, and then
most people are done by 9:00.
101

103
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:46,280
All right, so what does that mean for us?
102

104
00:06:46,290 --> 00:06:54,900
If you're going to post, try to post when there's
a peak. Try to post at 2:00 AM, 10:00 PM, and right
103

105
00:06:54,900 --> 00:07:02,520
around 5:00 PM. Try not to post at 9:00 AM
or 6:00 AM, just try to time it as well as you can.
104

106
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,600
I personally not going to follow this religiously, and
105

107
00:07:04,590 --> 00:07:06,070
you'll see this in my posting.
106

108
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:11,520
But for the most part when I'm scheduling posts, you'll notice that the first three posts I'll pick on exactly these time periods,
107

109
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:12,240
But for the most part when I'm scheduling posts, you'll notice that the first three posts I'll pick on exactly these time periods,
108

110
00:07:12,450 --> 00:07:17,820
and then I'll kind of move on to the second best ones,
and the third best one, and then eventually I just get to a
109

111
00:07:17,820 --> 00:07:20,490
point where I'm posting even at the low points.
110

112
00:07:20,490 --> 00:07:21,660
All right, guys, that's it for now.
111

113
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:25,290
Take this set of graphs and kind of internalize it,
112

114
00:07:25,290 --> 00:07:31,170
keep it in mind, just generally consider it best practice.
Later on we'll have a lot of data about our own audience,
113

115
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:37,360
and that data is definitely going to trump this, but for
now, this is the default we're going to use when posting.
114

116
00:07:37,470 --> 00:07:37,960
All right, guys.
115

117
00:07:37,980 --> 00:07:38,640
See you next lecture.
