00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,950
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:06,130
It's in this lecture we're going to do is we're going to talk about competitions and competitions are.

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:12,090
Well they're Xacto to sound like but it's where you give away something like a prize in return for your

4
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:20,430
users doing something like making a post or participating in some way writing a comment an essay.

5
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:22,280
Who knows.

6
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,090
And then there's obviously some type of judgment to that.

7
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:33,030
Now the most common ways you see this are bigger brands and this is why something I suggest for a company

8
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:37,780
accounts business accounts or sometimes personal accounts if you already have a lot of followers.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:42,600
Oftentimes what it is is I'll ask you to post a photo and it's related to your theme.

10
00:00:42,610 --> 00:00:49,350
Now they're relying on you to post that and to tag the same hash tag and it's just a way of kind of

11
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,650
generating buzz and ideally if they get a lot of posts they can try to get press for that or at a minimum

12
00:00:55,740 --> 00:01:01,160
they can leverage your own network because you've now posted it not only to others on their hashtags

13
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:03,500
but to your followers as well.

14
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,570
But of course it doesn't have to be a photo.

15
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:07,530
I've seen it in a lot of different ways.

16
00:01:07,530 --> 00:01:10,060
I've seen people do impromptu videos.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:15,810
We'll just ask them so I saw one that was giving away money for scholarships so they didn't ask people

18
00:01:15,810 --> 00:01:19,990
to just talk into the camera and say why they needed the money.

19
00:01:20,010 --> 00:01:22,930
And that was something that was pretty easy to use.

20
00:01:23,160 --> 00:01:29,130
And then they just said you know we will judge it or we'll have the community judged the best one.

21
00:01:29,130 --> 00:01:32,730
Now generally speaking the best practices for how to run competitions.

22
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:38,490
So you make sure that whatever it is you're giving away or how you run it is in line with your brand

23
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,350
style and essentially your brand behavior.

24
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:48,720
If you're a luxury brand it doesn't really make sense to run a competition for a very low prize amount

25
00:01:49,100 --> 00:01:53,860
where you ask people to do something that has nothing to do with what you actually stand for.

26
00:01:53,910 --> 00:02:00,900
Every brand generally speaking has a motto or has some type of values that you associate with it.

27
00:02:00,930 --> 00:02:07,630
And so the better they tie that into their competition the more likely it's going to be a success.

28
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:12,780
You know that you have to remember people are going to see this competition and as a side effect they're

29
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:17,610
going to build affinity for your brand and also as a side effect they potentially could become more

30
00:02:17,610 --> 00:02:19,850
interested in you and follow your account.

31
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,180
So if you do something that's completely out of line with your brand anyone who ends up following it

32
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:29,610
isn't going to be following it for the right reasons and you're not building a real following.

33
00:02:29,620 --> 00:02:35,610
The second best practice I've kind of identified is that you need to make sure that the ask from your

34
00:02:35,610 --> 00:02:38,260
followers is something that they would have done anyway.

35
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:39,070
Right.

36
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,130
So if you asked them to share about something they would find annoying.

37
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:47,960
That's pretty useful because that's actually something they might share on their own.

38
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:53,940
If you're a shoe brand and you ask people to write a haiku about their shoes it's probably not something

39
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:55,200
that's going to be very common.

40
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,250
And so people aren't going be raring to go to do that.

41
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:03,930
On the other hand if you're a basketball brand it's very easy to ask people to post clips of them playing

42
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:07,650
basketball because typically if you're playing basketball and your own Instagram you probably have some

43
00:03:07,650 --> 00:03:08,550
clips of you playing it.

44
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:11,440
Anyway back to the example in The Last Lecture meant.

45
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:17,100
Did that competition or I said please post a photo that's associated with some kind of financial success

46
00:03:17,100 --> 00:03:17,580
in your life.

47
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:22,730
Well that obviously makes sense because if someone for instance paid off all their college loans.

48
00:03:22,860 --> 00:03:24,940
That's something that they would have shared anyway.

49
00:03:24,960 --> 00:03:25,230
Right.

50
00:03:25,230 --> 00:03:31,500
So by aligning themselves with that they kind of lowered the friction in order to get more people to

51
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:32,340
participate.

52
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:35,930
So there's an example there's a magazine called the magazine.

53
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:42,330
I think in Dallas Texas and they're just a lifestyle and city magazine for Dallas yet what they did

54
00:03:42,330 --> 00:03:48,300
is they asked people to post the hash tag stay cool Dallas and then they asked them to show how they

55
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:50,910
are staying cool in the summer heat.

56
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:52,020
Now it's on again.

57
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,130
It works with their brand right.

58
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,410
Because they're trying to promote a lifestyle so they're trying to show how the people in their space

59
00:03:58,410 --> 00:03:59,160
live.

60
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:03,610
And the second thing was that they made it align with something they would have done anyway.

61
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:08,030
People want instagram post all the time if they're like it's really hot and they're at a pool.

62
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,440
Another best practice with competitions is that you use your own hashtag.

63
00:04:13,440 --> 00:04:15,180
Now this is pretty common.

64
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:19,980
And the reason why is because they want other people who are not necessarily going to submit something

65
00:04:19,980 --> 00:04:24,360
to your competition to be able to go and view what's already been submitted.

66
00:04:24,390 --> 00:04:29,780
And since Instagram has the ability to create hashtags on pretty much anything it works out pretty well

67
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:33,730
so it ends up happening is you pick a hashtag that's not currently being used.

68
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:35,780
And then you kind of take that over.

69
00:04:35,790 --> 00:04:40,700
Typically speaking you'll make it something that's very specific to your brand or your name.

70
00:04:40,830 --> 00:04:46,290
And that's another way of kind of getting your name out there if someone sees that this hashtag is trending.

71
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:48,240
OK well it's got your name in it.

72
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:48,780
There you go.

73
00:04:48,780 --> 00:04:49,940
That's an added benefit.

74
00:04:49,950 --> 00:04:54,550
Generally speaking with hashtags there's only a couple rules if you're going to make your own.

75
00:04:54,570 --> 00:04:57,620
You usually want to make sure that it's something that's short.

76
00:04:57,690 --> 00:04:59,100
It's memorable.

77
00:04:59,110 --> 00:05:05,560
It's vailable and it's something that's language universal short obviously makes sense you know want

78
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:11,470
some insanely long piece because people are less likely to post it as a hash tag because it just looks

79
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:12,450
tacky.

80
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:18,460
Memorable obviously makes sense because you're banking on other people telling friends about it or pointing

81
00:05:18,460 --> 00:05:19,660
it out to other people.

82
00:05:19,690 --> 00:05:22,210
The harder it is to remember the less likely that's going to happen.

83
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:29,260
Universal obviously makes sense because you don't want to use a region specific slang or use a language

84
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,080
or terms that no one in your audience group is going to understand.

85
00:05:33,130 --> 00:05:38,590
And then obviously available kind of goes without saying you don't want to post something that's memorable

86
00:05:38,590 --> 00:05:43,930
short and universal but it's being used by other people for other things besides ends up happening is

87
00:05:43,930 --> 00:05:47,160
people will go to that hash and they'll get confused as to what's going on.

88
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,010
They'll think it's somebody else who's running it.

89
00:05:50,050 --> 00:05:54,490
And also it's just going to lower the quality of that hash tag searchers because they can see other

90
00:05:54,490 --> 00:05:57,280
people posting who are not in line with what they're supposed to be telling.

91
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,140
So how exactly do you set these up logistically.

92
00:06:00,190 --> 00:06:06,310
Well generally speaking you want to start by having a prize then you have to have an ask and then you

93
00:06:06,310 --> 00:06:12,130
have to spend a decent amount of time putting specifications as to what they have to do in order to

94
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:13,400
enter the price is.

95
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:17,560
And then the last thing is that you need to make sure that there is a start and end date and then it's

96
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:21,840
very clear generally out front you have decide what it is that you to give away that you're going gonna

97
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:28,270
have to decide are you gonna try for some type of UGC strategy with your ass caps on post something

98
00:06:28,780 --> 00:06:31,740
or are you going to ask for just some type of participation.

99
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:40,450
Maybe you'll instead ask them to repost your giveaway post or tag friends or like and comment on as

100
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:42,760
many photos as they can on your account.

101
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:48,550
The point is you just need to decide what it is that's in line with your brand your goals and has to

102
00:06:48,550 --> 00:06:51,250
be useful to your account in some way.

103
00:06:51,250 --> 00:06:57,440
Keep in mind if you want to do a competition say based on whoever does the most of something like Who

104
00:06:57,460 --> 00:07:05,020
likes the most photos or comments on the most photos people can and will abuse that and so that's just

105
00:07:05,020 --> 00:07:06,530
something I kind of keep in mind.

106
00:07:06,580 --> 00:07:09,270
If you guys saw our Instagram live give away.

107
00:07:09,730 --> 00:07:15,160
I had people tag their friends and whoever tagged the most and got an answer correct was the one who

108
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:15,480
won.

109
00:07:15,510 --> 00:07:17,800
You notice very quickly people figured out loopholes.

110
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,280
They started tagging other people in the live chat and that obviously doesn't count.

111
00:07:22,300 --> 00:07:28,150
But that was obviously my fault not specifying that if you for instance whoever likes the most photos

112
00:07:28,390 --> 00:07:31,250
or whoever gets the most likes on their own post.

113
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,880
Just keep in mind there is a lot of tools out there.

114
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:36,580
You pay $2 and get a couple hundred likes.

115
00:07:36,580 --> 00:07:41,110
Similarly if you're going to judge it by saying hey we're just going to decide what the best one is

116
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,840
the community is not going to decide.

117
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,650
Well then you need to make sure that you specify what your criteria are it's not generally enough just

118
00:07:47,650 --> 00:07:53,110
to say we're going to decide what's the best you're going to say we're going to judge you based on creativity

119
00:07:53,110 --> 00:07:55,360
originality and relevance.

120
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,110
I don't know.

121
00:07:56,110 --> 00:07:57,050
Keep that in mind.

122
00:07:57,070 --> 00:07:59,850
The more you specify the less people will have to complain.

123
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:04,690
But also some you always have to keep in mind is that people will always find something to complain

124
00:08:04,690 --> 00:08:11,320
so it's just a matter of minimizing the gaps in what you say you're going to do and what people expect

125
00:08:11,320 --> 00:08:12,280
is going to happen.

126
00:08:12,280 --> 00:08:16,500
The last comment I'll give about competitions is what do people generally give away on them.

127
00:08:16,550 --> 00:08:19,740
Well generally speaking it can be a lot of different things.

128
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:22,450
Gift cards are pretty popular.

129
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:25,680
Giving away your product is extremely popular.

130
00:08:25,720 --> 00:08:28,090
If you have money to spend.

131
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:33,070
Giving away a flight or a trip is also very very popular.

132
00:08:33,070 --> 00:08:36,160
That's something that generally will get a lot of participation.

133
00:08:36,160 --> 00:08:39,280
Of course you have to remember it always has to tie in to your goals.

134
00:08:39,280 --> 00:08:43,540
You can't just be lazy and say we're going give away $50 in cash because you're going to be attracting

135
00:08:43,540 --> 00:08:45,910
people for the wrong reasons.

136
00:08:45,910 --> 00:08:52,990
Sure you can give away a trip for $2000 but unless your account is a travel account or year you cover

137
00:08:52,990 --> 00:08:58,630
media events and they're going to that specifically or some way you can tie in a location to what you

138
00:08:58,630 --> 00:08:59,400
do.

139
00:08:59,410 --> 00:09:04,760
It's kind of a waste and you run the potential of just kind of swinging and missing.

140
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:09,120
All right guys that's enough about competitions as you notice is not something that we do on innovation

141
00:09:09,130 --> 00:09:09,830
station.

142
00:09:09,850 --> 00:09:14,850
It's too complicated and in general we're not a large enough account to make it work.

143
00:09:14,860 --> 00:09:19,330
High threshold contests like this are not going to get a lot of participation.

144
00:09:19,330 --> 00:09:24,280
And if you don't have a large account yet then you know your odds of reaching that critical mass where

145
00:09:24,340 --> 00:09:27,430
it's actually interesting how many submissions you have.

146
00:09:27,430 --> 00:09:31,090
Well you know you're just going to fall flat right next October to talk about something that's way more
