00:00:00.320 --> 00:00:02.370
Hey guys welcome back in this lecture.

2
00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:07.140
We're going to do is we're going to review some of the tools that are available for you for improving

3
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:15.490
your post performance and we're going to review a class of apps out there that essentially kind of game

4
00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:18.970
refine the process of getting likes on your posts.

5
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:22.190
And I set you up at this big network of people who are doing the same thing.

6
00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:26.310
So it's a really easy way of getting extra likes on your post.

7
00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:29.910
Extra saves and even potentially extra follows.

8
00:00:29.990 --> 00:00:30.240
OK.

9
00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.650
So the main one at the moment is called follow or go like there's a bunch of home.

10
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:37.490
Honestly if you search for a magic potion that's another one.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:39.290
There's one called Magic Leiker.

12
00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.770
They all kind of work the same way.

13
00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:42.000
So let me show you how they work.

14
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.580
They're usually like this.

15
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.690
Divided up into multiple categories.

16
00:00:45.690 --> 00:00:49.110
Usually they're based off like coin systems.

17
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.050
So the basic concept here is they'll show you a bunch of posts and you go through it manually like all

18
00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:56.390
of those posts.

19
00:00:56.910 --> 00:01:01.830
And by doing that you earn coins then what you can do is you can spend those coins to get people to

20
00:01:01.830 --> 00:01:04.170
like your post right back.

21
00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:04.440
Right.

22
00:01:04.440 --> 00:01:08.190
So it's just this big web of super casualty.

23
00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.190
And for the most part it works pretty well.

24
00:01:11.190 --> 00:01:14.190
One thing you have to be aware of is the kind of little Spammy.

25
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:18.760
And so they will up sell you a lot of the time on things that you probably don't even need.

26
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:22.470
So like this one for instance tries up sell you a lot on analytics some of these are actually kind of

27
00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:27.570
useful in the sense that like showing your top loyal followers that's could be interesting.

28
00:01:27.570 --> 00:01:32.700
Certainly if you're going to try to do something with them or tag them every single time you post or

29
00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:35.770
if you have some kind of strategic plan for using them that's pretty useful.

30
00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:40.800
The way it works for the most part here is if I go to earn coins right in the middle.

31
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:44.730
So again it's in to try to sell me a bunch of coins and you can see I have six hundred eighteen coins

32
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.890
and I'm not sure how I got that.

33
00:01:46.890 --> 00:01:49.610
I think you get more every time you log in.

34
00:01:49.770 --> 00:01:51.350
So they try to get you to log in a lot.

35
00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:56.810
So if you just hit the X don't hit it now because now is talking about the deal and X again.

36
00:01:56.830 --> 00:02:00.810
Eventually it'll get you do this because they all say like for instance follow plus And then how many

37
00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:02.790
coins you'd get.

38
00:02:02.790 --> 00:02:05.580
So if you wanted to follow them that's fine.

39
00:02:05.580 --> 00:02:08.840
I typically use a follower boughts I don't do any of these.

40
00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:14.400
I keep hitting X number on offers and he follows eventually I'll get like likes for instance and as

41
00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:14.740
easily.

42
00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:16.600
One so I can at like.

43
00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:18.290
And then you go I turned a coin.

44
00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:19.770
I liked that person's photo.

45
00:02:19.770 --> 00:02:23.910
The reason why I put this into the habit section is because this is a habit that you can build in pretty

46
00:02:23.910 --> 00:02:24.470
easily.

47
00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:30.420
So if you just spend maybe five minutes a day just going through these maybe following an account you

48
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:38.040
can just add a lot of coins pretty quickly and then you can pretty much start using these two bous post

49
00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.960
especially post that didn't do as well.

50
00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.440
You can use that kind of level out the problems you're having.

51
00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:45.180
They have a section here called auto mode.

52
00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:48.730
So if you hit auto mode what it does is it'll just do it for you.

53
00:02:48.750 --> 00:02:51.900
So you just say ok see how it'll just automatically go through.

54
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:59.430
Now I don't typically do this just because I don't want it to do the bare minimum of just trying to

55
00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:03.240
follow cheap accounts over and over again.

56
00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:04.780
Again that's just my strategy.

57
00:03:04.780 --> 00:03:09.750
I use something else for it so I don't want that to conflict with the system I already have.

58
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:13.590
But if this is ongoing it is quite useful to you you could just use the auto mode.

59
00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:18.300
So now that I actually have some coins that you do as you go over here and pick which post you want

60
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:23.550
and you can look at literally any of your post and it actually pretty useful because it shows you stats

61
00:03:23.550 --> 00:03:26.390
right here which sometimes aren't immediately easy to find.

62
00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.320
So if you're on the apps like this almost 14.

63
00:03:29.430 --> 00:03:33.430
So what it might do is I might just boost it and again they'll try to get you to buy stuff so right

64
00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.430
there just ignore that.

65
00:03:34.470 --> 00:03:37.740
Now go down here and you can actually use your coins to buy likes.

66
00:03:37.740 --> 00:03:40.110
You can also do comments to kind of same thing.

67
00:03:40.110 --> 00:03:42.000
You can also do views.

68
00:03:42.030 --> 00:03:46.400
Generally speaking I don't really do the comments because the comments are kind of fake.

69
00:03:46.410 --> 00:03:49.990
I mean they just look like robots that really help you with your engagement that well.

70
00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:53.750
So let's say I have 600 coins.

71
00:03:53.870 --> 00:03:54.430
Let's see.

72
00:03:54.430 --> 00:03:55.780
So I'll get 100 likes.

73
00:03:55.970 --> 00:03:56.280
OK.

74
00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:01.640
So I clicked that and now it's going to process and it estimates over the next 60 minutes will be deliver

75
00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:05.020
and that's just because now they're presenting it in front of other people now they have to go through

76
00:04:05.020 --> 00:04:10.420
and manually do it because a lot of people aren't auto mode so that's you know kind of easy for them.

77
00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.800
OK so that's basically the concept here.

78
00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:18.810
If this is something that's useful to you in appealing to you I suggest trying it out.

79
00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:24.630
It's not really something I do just because there's easier ways for me to get engagement and rather

80
00:04:24.630 --> 00:04:31.710
focus on my content as opposed to making a habit of using these kind of one for one exchanges later

81
00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:36.830
on will cover the Jarvi like exchange and that's through a software that we install later on as we get

82
00:04:36.830 --> 00:04:40.740
in the more advanced sections that software actually has a like exchange that's pretty much automatic

83
00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.160
and it's way better than this so that's why I don't.

84
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:45.490
Another reason I don't to this.

85
00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:47.510
But it's something that you can very easily figure out.

86
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:48.730
It's FREE.

87
00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:53.490
You just have to be aware that they're going to try to constantly up sell you on pretty much everything

88
00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:54.170
possible.

89
00:04:54.210 --> 00:04:58.580
Like I said if you can't find this on iOS then search for magic potion or magic Leiker.

90
00:04:58.770 --> 00:05:02.150
Android has similar versions of it they might just have a slightly different name.

91
00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:02.550
All right guys.

92
00:05:02.550 --> 00:05:07.740
That being said that's something worth checking out see if it fits with you and your habit schedule.

93
00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:08.000
All right.

94
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.790
CNN ex-boxer.
