00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.770
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.770 --> 00:00:06.010
So this lecture I'm going to do is I'm going to use Final Cut Pro.

3
00:00:06.030 --> 00:00:11.010
We learned how to use in the last lecture and I'm going to create a video that I can then post on Instagram

4
00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.290
for innovation station.

5
00:00:13.590 --> 00:00:19.620
Well before we establish what the content strategy was for innovation station it's a lot of videos obviously

6
00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:27.570
but what is primarily going to be is highlighting innovation new technologies gadgets and just things.

7
00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:32.320
A lot of it will be medical chemical and laboratory science things like that.

8
00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:40.230
Now the style that I was probably going to go after was a very common style where you just see a video

9
00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:44.580
clip followed by video clip video that you and you just have techs kind of popping up explaining what

10
00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:51.030
you're seeing and either it's explaining the video clip or the video clip is just a way to fill in kind

11
00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:54.840
of the mental image of what you're supposed to be imagining while you're reading the text.

12
00:00:54.840 --> 00:00:55.320
OK.

13
00:00:55.410 --> 00:00:58.020
I'm sure you've seen these a lot of people on Facebook.

14
00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:00.090
We'll share them on Instagram.

15
00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:01.460
They're there all the time.

16
00:01:01.470 --> 00:01:06.140
You look at some of the accounts that we kind of stock with innovations station.

17
00:01:06.150 --> 00:01:10.570
They do the same thing it's just clip tax cut tax cut.

18
00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:11.960
And it is a.

19
00:01:12.040 --> 00:01:17.690
It's incredibly effective to understand that they're only working with the real estate of a phone screen

20
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:23.340
and you're trying to explain something that isn't you someone up in an image Kelleys you can't get the

21
00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:24.780
appreciation of it from an image.

22
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:33.020
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to take one thing that I've found and or make a video out of it.

23
00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:33.230
All right.

24
00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:40.740
They're digging around and I found this and what it was a team in Maryland has made a figure a way to

25
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:50.100
take wood and pull out the humo cellulose out of it which just makes it this fiber grid and that removes

26
00:01:50.100 --> 00:01:56.130
the color of the wood and removes the density of the wood which means it's a much lighter wood but then

27
00:01:56.130 --> 00:02:02.360
it becomes effectively like an insulator and replacement for Styrofoam.

28
00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:03.930
So if you take would you remove it.

29
00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:11.760
Now you have styrofoam surfaces notorious because it doesn't biodegrade and it's just everywhere.

30
00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:19.300
I think there's a stat I saw somewhere that was 25 billion cups a year or thrown away sorry if cops

31
00:02:19.330 --> 00:02:20.650
thrown away in the US alone.

32
00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.550
So kind of a big deal.

33
00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.750
Well there aren't and so if you can figure this out they'll be kind of interesting.

34
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:30.150
I think that something worth highlighting so I scratched down some notes over here after reading about

35
00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:30.320
it.

36
00:02:30.330 --> 00:02:33.090
I grab some interesting facts but some sources.

37
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:36.390
And then I planned out the text here.

38
00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:41.760
So I kind of just I just kind of thought of it like how you know how many different points can I do.

39
00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:47.940
And so I came up with seven points and I listed them off and then I just kind of gave a loose idea of

40
00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:49.530
what kind of an image I thought.

41
00:02:49.530 --> 00:02:54.090
So at the beginning I'm going to introduce it by saying it's a team at the University of Maryland they've

42
00:02:54.090 --> 00:02:59.380
invented a new type of light weight would then get into the details like explaining how do they do it.

43
00:02:59.390 --> 00:03:01.340
What is it then how does it actually.

44
00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.480
What does it matter.

45
00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.460
Why do we care.

46
00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.800
Ben this is the alternative why styrofoam is bad then it's you know what are the main benefits of it.

47
00:03:09.810 --> 00:03:11.120
And then I'll go on to like tradition.

48
00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:14.160
Other possible uses for it.

49
00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:16.760
And then maybe some just interesting facts.

50
00:03:16.780 --> 00:03:19.170
OK so I kind of pulled these out of it.

51
00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:20.520
It's called Nano wood.

52
00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.390
Styrofoam makes up 30 percent of worldwide landfills.

53
00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.890
Those interesting takes 500 years to biodegrade so they're going on the ground it's not going anywhere.

54
00:03:28.920 --> 00:03:36.510
It is actually better at insulating houses than traditional fiberglass and wool and it's retains more

55
00:03:36.510 --> 00:03:41.410
heat energy than silica aerogel which is the world's best insulator and the Guinness Book of World Records

56
00:03:41.410 --> 00:03:43.900
said they're the best the best insulator I don't know why.

57
00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.300
Guinness Book of World Records.

58
00:03:45.330 --> 00:03:47.480
But regardless that's interesting.

59
00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:47.790
OK.

60
00:03:47.790 --> 00:03:52.630
So that's what I'm going to put in and then I just need to find clips for this.

61
00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:56.880
Well where does focusing on making the video and really sourcing it.

62
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.330
But I can show you where I found the videos.

63
00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:05.620
So what I did was I went to video pixel's home.

64
00:04:05.640 --> 00:04:08.460
Remember we covered those stock video places.

65
00:04:08.460 --> 00:04:09.710
This is where I got most of them.

66
00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:14.400
So my first shot called for trees and forest.

67
00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:16.600
So I just said Drees.

68
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:17.390
OK.

69
00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:21.720
And I looked through it and I was like OK what really gets across the point that I'm trying to make

70
00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.890
which is I'm highlighting trees because we're talking about wood right.

71
00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:27.930
I could just say wood but I just wouldn't really work the same.

72
00:04:27.930 --> 00:04:28.530
I'm trying to go for them.

73
00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.410
It looks good.

74
00:04:29.430 --> 00:04:32.680
It was just like wood blocks.

75
00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:37.290
Then you might be implying construction which is not really what I'm talking about.

76
00:04:37.380 --> 00:04:39.580
So this is the way I actually ended up picking.

77
00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:40.160
OK.

78
00:04:40.260 --> 00:04:44.650
And the next one was remove this from making it soft and light.

79
00:04:44.670 --> 00:04:44.940
OK.

80
00:04:44.940 --> 00:04:51.350
So I just googled their thing and I found photos of them holding it.

81
00:04:51.420 --> 00:04:51.650
OK.

82
00:04:51.660 --> 00:04:52.890
Smithsonian.

83
00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:55.050
There was this so there images for this.

84
00:04:55.170 --> 00:04:56.240
OK.

85
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.800
I think I could use these potentially in it.

86
00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.610
I don't know.

87
00:04:59.910 --> 00:05:07.860
Thinking is that the resolution size might not be large enough so we can look at it's like 20 killable.

88
00:05:08.430 --> 00:05:10.150
OK maybe.

89
00:05:10.230 --> 00:05:19.320
And then what I did was the image of team or people using trash I found a lot of pectorals landfill

90
00:05:19.410 --> 00:05:21.630
for whatever reason pencils didn't have it.

91
00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:28.770
So what I'm doing was I went to all the free stock and free Stockdale's videos although their site is

92
00:05:28.770 --> 00:05:31.390
kind of screwed up when it comes to videos.

93
00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:35.800
They just give you lists of video sites.

94
00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:38.410
So really it's just like a linked directory more than anything.

95
00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:44.270
But I found it on one of these I don't remember which one it wasn't even video or something video I

96
00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:52.490
remember but all the other ones I found so laboratory kind of pixels construction of a house actually

97
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:55.790
I found on YouTube.

98
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:59.490
So I just went to YouTube and I put house construction

99
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:08.580
house construction and I just used one of these timelapse is.

100
00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:13.650
And what you can do actually on YouTube is go here to filter and then change the features so filter

101
00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:15.230
by something that's at least HD.

102
00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.540
I believe it's at least HD and then there's four OK but we don't need for you to be honest.

103
00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:27.120
We just want at least HD so this can help you because sometimes you get stuck with a perfect video but

104
00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:32.580
the video is just way too low quality and then it's just a huge pain.

105
00:06:32.580 --> 00:06:35.730
The next thing was insulation construction and I was just going to use for that one.

106
00:06:35.730 --> 00:06:39.540
That was a photo of a video of cold weather.

107
00:06:39.540 --> 00:06:39.920
That was it.

108
00:06:39.930 --> 00:06:46.050
I mean in a pinch I can use a photo that's pretty easy and I'll show you how to make those not look

109
00:06:46.050 --> 00:06:50.380
like crap but video is always better than not video.

110
00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:50.720
OK.

111
00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:55.430
So we will hop in Final Cut Pro and then create a new project called Nano.

112
00:06:55.570 --> 00:06:56.650
Good.

113
00:06:57.300 --> 00:06:58.090
OK.

114
00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.190
Now you're here.

115
00:07:00.270 --> 00:07:00.720
OK.

116
00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:07.710
So what I want to do is I want to do it in each individual segment so I need to get these into the timeline

117
00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:08.420
in order.

118
00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:10.160
So I want the trees in the forest.

119
00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:14.300
I will go to the images that I collected.

120
00:07:14.310 --> 00:07:23.380
It's going to start with trees then moving on to the actual image of the wood.

121
00:07:23.410 --> 00:07:27.250
I downloaded it so pull it out of the download folder.

122
00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:33.940
You go just then and I would think that's most relevant when you put an image into the timeline of Final

123
00:07:33.940 --> 00:07:34.720
Cut.

124
00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.590
It's an image.

125
00:07:35.650 --> 00:07:37.310
So it doesn't have a length.

126
00:07:37.390 --> 00:07:41.740
So you can do anything you want with a link length it always makes it automatically something like six

127
00:07:41.740 --> 00:07:42.790
seconds or something.

128
00:07:42.790 --> 00:07:45.320
Then I have a photo of someone throwing some stuff in the trash.

129
00:07:45.320 --> 00:07:50.340
And OK I'm just going to throw these all into it and I'll catch you in a second.

130
00:08:11.530 --> 00:08:15.250
OK so you'll notice that it actually says it ends up being eight minutes.

131
00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:20.100
Now that I've actually thrown them all in but that's not correct you have to be a minute.

132
00:08:20.110 --> 00:08:20.670
Right.

133
00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:26.680
Well it would end up happening was I found clips that were not just the clips I wanted like on YouTube

134
00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:30.670
for instance I did get a photo of a landfill for some reason I couldn't find one anywhere else.

135
00:08:30.670 --> 00:08:36.170
So I just grabbed a documentary that had it and then threw it in and I just sorted by it.

136
00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:40.950
You know the HD and I checked it it wasn't something that's probably going to be copyrighted.

137
00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.270
And same thing on here on YouTube we have the timeline.

138
00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:48.850
So what I have to do is basically scrub through this and pick the part that I think matches what I'm

139
00:08:48.850 --> 00:08:49.870
talking about the most.

140
00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:56.230
So for this like a landfill the landfill is supposed to be showing up wallets saying styrofoam makes

141
00:08:56.230 --> 00:08:59.410
up 30 percent of worldwide landfills six or five years degree.

142
00:08:59.480 --> 00:09:03.760
Well can't really find styrofoam specifically for an image which is fine just to show a landfill because

143
00:09:03.760 --> 00:09:05.240
that's gross and that's what you care about.

144
00:09:05.290 --> 00:09:05.820
Right.

145
00:09:06.070 --> 00:09:08.680
So I just scrub through it.

146
00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:09.910
What gets the point across.

147
00:09:09.910 --> 00:09:15.170
I think that probably section right there.

148
00:09:15.350 --> 00:09:24.310
See said that is five seconds but read because that's about five seconds of footage or use that typically

149
00:09:24.310 --> 00:09:32.500
I don't like it to change clips like change orientation or shots in the same little clip because it

150
00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:36.220
could just be a little jarring but that's always something you can tweak after the fact.

151
00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:43.180
So if you want to cut the clip didn't actually cut this and the other UI lecture you just how you can

152
00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:49.130
either be what I do and it turns in a razor and then when I click somewhere it cuts it.

153
00:09:49.350 --> 00:09:51.410
It controls the if I don't go back.

154
00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.380
Or there's actually a button right here.

155
00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.330
So you find the Boid right there and then it gives you the boy.

156
00:09:58.360 --> 00:10:01.070
Usually you're on the select mode you the boy.

157
00:10:01.310 --> 00:10:01.560
OK.

158
00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:07.790
So you go to here start there and then mumble law

159
00:10:10.540 --> 00:10:13.150
OK and then I'll delete the stuff I don't want.

160
00:10:17.070 --> 00:10:17.520
OK.

161
00:10:17.520 --> 00:10:19.520
Now moving on to the house construction.

162
00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:25.260
I just want to find a shop that has the most action and gets the point across and say like three or

163
00:10:25.260 --> 00:10:30.140
four seconds this can be a little noxious because it's light keeps changing.

164
00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:31.560
You know is this a time lapse.

165
00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:36.430
It's kind of OK so it needs the construction of a house that needs to be looked like it's being in there

166
00:10:36.460 --> 00:10:38.120
need to be able to recognize its house.

167
00:10:38.130 --> 00:10:39.500
Can't really tell there.

168
00:10:39.630 --> 00:10:43.260
But then here it doesn't look like they're constructing it necessarily at a glance.

169
00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:44.580
Looks like it's done.

170
00:10:44.640 --> 00:10:50.590
So this is probably the best spot to do that.

171
00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:53.720
So grab that.

172
00:10:53.820 --> 00:10:59.910
This is be hard to put text on just because the background colors is changing so much.

173
00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:03.650
And the last one was cold weather and I'll add that when I come to it.

174
00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:03.870
OK.

175
00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:06.550
Next thing just do some housecleaning.

176
00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:13.110
Getting rid of the audio because I don't want audio from these videos.

177
00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:15.700
OK so now we're at two minutes total.

178
00:11:15.710 --> 00:11:16.540
OK.

179
00:11:16.550 --> 00:11:23.030
So realistically what's going to happen is I'll just cut everything to the same length and then re watch

180
00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:27.470
it at the very end to see if the timing works because if the timing works and ok cool but otherwise

181
00:11:27.770 --> 00:11:29.020
I can always change it.

182
00:11:29.030 --> 00:11:33.770
Now one final finally for this nice is like say if I only want it half the trees I cut it right there

183
00:11:33.950 --> 00:11:35.050
and then delete this.

184
00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:40.490
But if I want it back and I'm like oh crap or did you just grab the edge intellectually just bring it

185
00:11:40.490 --> 00:11:41.480
right back.

186
00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:42.980
So that's pretty useful.

187
00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:49.730
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to say that each text block needs hardly three and a half seconds

188
00:11:49.730 --> 00:11:51.680
probably three to four seconds.

189
00:11:51.680 --> 00:11:55.950
So I'm going to stop it for this first one.

190
00:11:55.980 --> 00:11:58.240
Say four seconds.

191
00:11:58.850 --> 00:12:03.750
And then the next time around eight six.

192
00:12:06.180 --> 00:12:09.040
This will get to about 8:00 ish.

193
00:12:09.030 --> 00:12:10.450
And on this one.

194
00:12:10.540 --> 00:12:15.770
This is kind of annoying because it you like at first you don't really know what the hell you're looking

195
00:12:15.770 --> 00:12:19.030
at because it just has this glut of nothing happening.

196
00:12:19.130 --> 00:12:23.100
So I'm going to trim this stuff down and I'll see you in just a second.

197
00:12:34.750 --> 00:12:35.190
OK.

198
00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:43.040
So what I have here is about thirty five seconds eight seven seconds I could shave it down on the last

199
00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:46.430
wrong but I think this is pretty good actually.

200
00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:53.430
You remember that audio but for the most part this will match that story line that I made.

201
00:12:53.910 --> 00:12:56.640
The rest it'll just be kind of figuring out they're going to be longer.

202
00:12:56.750 --> 00:13:02.200
I tried to grab clips that made the most sense like this was the most visceral like trying to shoot

203
00:13:02.210 --> 00:13:04.220
trash trash is bad as you we're talking about.

204
00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:05.480
So there you go.

205
00:13:05.540 --> 00:13:11.990
I picked this part of the house construction because you can see them putting a roof on.

206
00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:15.720
So the only part you can actually see the most things happening.

207
00:13:15.830 --> 00:13:19.880
And then here I just picked this because there wasn't a car coming by access although that was distracting.

208
00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:23.030
So between those I know it's good.

209
00:13:23.030 --> 00:13:29.690
Now why did you decide on our transitions and text like the lower thirds so.

210
00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:30.800
Well probably.

211
00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:35.560
Do you think we'll go with text first.

212
00:13:35.670 --> 00:13:38.230
So over to text.

213
00:13:38.660 --> 00:13:44.540
Ok now I'm just going to do custom tax because I don't really want to deal with the pre-made stuff.

214
00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:48.520
Easier to control it when it's you're doing it yourself.

215
00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.850
OK so you have custom text here.

216
00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:56.560
Well I'd probably go with open sand's because that.

217
00:13:56.810 --> 00:14:01.980
Well no actually I think you doomed to the other one that where you use an actual logo.

218
00:14:01.980 --> 00:14:05.160
So I'll try to do you two instead.

219
00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:09.980
See how it looks and it doesn't work we can pick another one.

220
00:14:09.980 --> 00:14:10.760
There you go.

221
00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:15.880
There is a boom to cool hats.

222
00:14:15.900 --> 00:14:22.740
So typically you see them on the bottom left top right sometimes coming down the center but it's not

223
00:14:22.950 --> 00:14:23.780
that common.

224
00:14:23.780 --> 00:14:27.780
So we will see the bottom left from now.

225
00:14:27.780 --> 00:14:36.170
Now let's use the text that we made in.

226
00:14:36.330 --> 00:14:41.430
So we want to make the text large enough to read it but we don't make it so there's so much text you

227
00:14:41.430 --> 00:14:42.560
just can't.

228
00:14:42.630 --> 00:14:44.780
You're having trouble even seeing it.

229
00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.040
That's that would be an issue.

230
00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.770
So what I'm gonna do is make a shape and have that shape come in and then have the text sitting on it

231
00:14:52.850 --> 00:14:59.330
and I'm thinking that the shape and I could use one of these generators these structures that they give

232
00:14:59.330 --> 00:15:02.580
to these textures they give you or I just use a generic shape.

233
00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:03.820
I think that's what I'm going to do.

234
00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:11.050
So you go all in good shape you know doing a shape we want to text and on top of it so we put the shape

235
00:15:11.050 --> 00:15:11.670
below it.

236
00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.970
Now automatically It starts with the circle but we never go to the inspector and then we just close

237
00:15:15.970 --> 00:15:20.220
like the outline and fill is white.

238
00:15:20.260 --> 00:15:23.270
So now you pick a color from our go

239
00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:29.170
OK so I want to pick a color I have the hex codes.

240
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:31.040
So I go here.

241
00:15:31.260 --> 00:15:32.360
See what we've got.

242
00:15:37.560 --> 00:15:41.790
What I can do after I see the colors if I want to use them over and over again I can stick them over

243
00:15:41.790 --> 00:15:43.300
in these little premade slots.

244
00:15:43.310 --> 00:15:46.220
I can just grab them easily later.

245
00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:50.330
And as I'm doing it's also nice because I can see what contrasts with the text

246
00:15:58.080 --> 00:16:00.660
OK let's put it actually in a shape that makes sense.

247
00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:08.460
A rectangle Okay now what looks the best the rest of what's going on

248
00:16:16.310 --> 00:16:17.860
and just go with that.

249
00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:20.390
Once you see how it works you and change colors later.

250
00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:20.900
OK.

251
00:16:20.930 --> 00:16:21.200
An.

252
00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:27.690
That the shape doesn't persist past this clip so I'll just use this to pop up and then move on to the

253
00:16:27.690 --> 00:16:29.570
next one really the next pop up.

254
00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:30.310
OK.

255
00:16:30.330 --> 00:16:33.320
So I'm coming out of the corner.

256
00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:39.390
You want to be conservative with the amount of space we have to use so we can actually see what's going

257
00:16:39.390 --> 00:16:40.520
on in the background.

258
00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:57.740
So using this little modifier here you know control t changing the size of the.

259
00:16:57.890 --> 00:16:59.150
That's pretty good.

260
00:16:59.150 --> 00:17:02.860
Terms of sizing have a little wine that issue.

261
00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:05.820
But see what we can do is go to alignment in the text.

262
00:17:05.990 --> 00:17:06.160
OK.

263
00:17:06.170 --> 00:17:08.660
So you can left align it right aligned.

264
00:17:08.690 --> 00:17:14.070
There there's some weird bugs so that if you write a line it sometimes it cuts off taxi kind of just

265
00:17:14.070 --> 00:17:18.080
finagle it didn't know that hundreds of people worked on the software and still can't figure this out

266
00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:19.770
for some reason.

267
00:17:20.210 --> 00:17:29.250
So they're you know we went on a poll the tech said a little bit more are those sheeple that more now

268
00:17:29.250 --> 00:17:31.030
we can preview how that looks.

269
00:17:32.750 --> 00:17:35.220
It's not bad.

270
00:17:35.230 --> 00:17:41.800
I think the color we're seeing the text for most part works maybe a little bit Kramm to do is play with

271
00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:50.550
the opacity of the back shape the video should be at the bottom.

272
00:17:51.210 --> 00:17:56.790
I don't really know how useful it is it's just going to depend on how hard it makes reading.

273
00:17:56.820 --> 00:18:00.970
I think a little bit of opacities helpful because it doesn't mean having the background.
