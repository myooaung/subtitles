00:00:00.270 --> 00:00:01.720
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:05.190
Let's wrap up the tools section of Jarvi.

3
00:00:05.190 --> 00:00:10.080
Remember tool section is pretty much all the magic happens so that's why we're spending the least amount

4
00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:14.150
of time getting to know each one of these little tool tabs.

5
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:19.030
Now last I actually we covered reposts So we're going to move along to users and hash tags.

6
00:00:19.030 --> 00:00:23.370
Now do you guys watch the section on optimizing your hashtags.

7
00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:26.510
We actually use the Jarvi hash tag tool.

8
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:29.220
So I would check that out there specifically.

9
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.500
There's nothing really here that plays into your zombie strategy.

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:40.020
The only thing I do use this form with zombies is occasionally like once every two weeks coming in here

11
00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.400
and what I'll do is scrape a bunch of hash tags that are related to something.

12
00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:51.540
So you go here to search and I might search for Takk and then see what it gives me and then what I would

13
00:00:51.540 --> 00:00:58.400
do is just take a bunch of these that I think are related like tech technology not techno.

14
00:00:58.430 --> 00:01:00.850
That's music tech life blah blah blah.

15
00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:03.210
Make sure it has a decent amount of public posts remember.

16
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:05.280
Use the same strategies you've talked about before.

17
00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:09.570
Make sure you're not picking gigantic ones like Realistically I wouldn't pick technology it's way too

18
00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:13.900
big or any of these really I'd pick some kind of medium middle of the road ones.

19
00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.870
But once you pick them then I can have it scrape a minimum number of hash tags if I want to know what

20
00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:24.500
this will do a little force it to say give me 50 suggested or similar hashtags related to ones I picked.

21
00:01:24.540 --> 00:01:29.430
So what I can do then is search related hash tags and it will.

22
00:01:29.430 --> 00:01:31.740
It takes awhile but it will give me 50 that are related.

23
00:01:31.730 --> 00:01:36.270
Those ones I did know what I'll do is then copy and paste those over into my zombies.

24
00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:40.550
And that's an easy quick way of refreshing your hash tags.

25
00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.510
I'm sure there's a better way of doing it but it's pretty quick and easy.

26
00:01:43.530 --> 00:01:48.150
Now here's one more section we've got like comments and then will wrap up after this with story of your

27
00:01:48.240 --> 00:01:49.270
with like comments.

28
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:52.710
Basically what this does is it looks for commentaries and it likes them.

29
00:01:52.710 --> 00:01:57.240
I don't have to get too specific about the settings here because this is wholly dependent on how many

30
00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.180
comments you get but in general make sure that it's doing it the same period of time that your counter-service

31
00:02:02.190 --> 00:02:09.020
be awake and make sure that you have a healthy kind of in between for seconds that you might like something

32
00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:09.270
again.

33
00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:12.040
Think about a human being like if you read my comments.

34
00:02:12.110 --> 00:02:17.120
I like something how long it take me to read the next comment before I like it so you can get I think

35
00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.480
pretty aggressive with this one.

36
00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:25.710
I could lower this down quite a bit and I think it's pretty normal to like easily like one to five in

37
00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:31.110
each operation and then wait a very short period of time because again assuming you're on the post that

38
00:02:31.110 --> 00:02:36.270
would be pretty normal and then obviously you can drill down here by not for instance liking comments

39
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:37.020
that are English.

40
00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:40.890
This is really just to save your bot time.

41
00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:45.030
If you get these wrong or you don't put a lot of time into them it's not really going to kill you because

42
00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:46.530
it doesn't really matter.

43
00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.330
Glassing worth checking anything is just a story of you or this is something I occasionally do and just

44
00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:55.320
because it's one of those things it's like a curve ball you can throw in there to make your account

45
00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.870
look as real as possible and not everybody uses this perfectly fine but I generally like to make sure

46
00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.770
that my accounts watch oh I don't know.

47
00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:07.190
I don't think I have it between five and 10 posts now.

48
00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:12.060
Keep in mind each post has a story so with here looking at stories and clicking now would be a singular

49
00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.460
post and then I have it waiting like so every 30 minutes.

50
00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:21.990
It checks out a story something like that and then I have a cap so that it mostly views a certain amount

51
00:03:21.990 --> 00:03:22.560
per day.

52
00:03:22.590 --> 00:03:23.830
You wouldn't want this bot.

53
00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:27.180
That's just a story consuming machine.

54
00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:30.200
Also keep in mind it's going be dependent on how many people you're following.

55
00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:35.480
So if you're unfallen quickly after you follow these some of these settings aren't going to matter because

56
00:03:35.490 --> 00:03:38.330
you're not going to that many people even view stories from.

57
00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:44.790
OK so the last thing worth checking out is the copy settings function and that's extremely useful when

58
00:03:44.790 --> 00:03:46.350
you have lots and lots of zombies.

59
00:03:46.350 --> 00:03:53.380
Right so what you would do is if for instance I wanted my own technology to be the main account or to

60
00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:58.350
have all the settings I set up for this one applied to other ones I can copy settings and then what

61
00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:00.270
I can do is copy.

62
00:04:00.690 --> 00:04:06.660
I can send it to other accounts and then over here I can tell specifically what function or what setting

63
00:04:06.690 --> 00:04:07.910
I want to send.

64
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:15.690
So if I spent a lot of time on my story viewer or on my like bot I could go and only specifically send

65
00:04:15.690 --> 00:04:17.570
the functions from that.

66
00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:22.490
Now specifically here it's going to give me the functions that are whichever tab I had open so I had

67
00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:28.470
the follow section open and it automatically here is checked all the things that I personally have set

68
00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:34.260
and I can send that to another account so that account to be created before like I did click this and

69
00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:38.580
then I could just send it all of the same settings that I have.

70
00:04:38.580 --> 00:04:42.570
Now one thing I think it's pretty important that I didn't have check was remove poor quality sources

71
00:04:42.990 --> 00:04:44.450
but I get it OK.

72
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:49.930
And then if I were to switch over to the new account so I would just click Tools again.

73
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:53.310
And then scroll down and find it

74
00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:58.840
so down here is a new account that we created.

75
00:04:58.850 --> 00:05:00.430
That's technology today.

76
00:05:00.660 --> 00:05:06.990
Now if I look at my follow it should have Barodia So it has the same settings.

77
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:12.780
It might be missing a couple because I didn't check every single box but that's a cheap easy way of

78
00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:18.570
applying it to a bunch of these so if you spent say an hour and a half creating 30 news zombies or whatever

79
00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:23.250
and it's a good idea to batch them you could then take your main account and then send the settings

80
00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:26.980
to them so you're not going through every single one and setting the settings yourself.

81
00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:34.770
Now also keep in mind a lot of these settings can be dynamic especially when you get to like repo's

82
00:05:34.770 --> 00:05:35.630
transcends.

83
00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:40.400
We set those captions and depending on what you put here it could be a bunch of wild cards.

84
00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.560
So you're not going to have the same exact caption.

85
00:05:43.590 --> 00:05:45.690
It could actually just be random.

86
00:05:45.690 --> 00:05:51.600
So if you're really smart about it you can kind of design your settings to not be the exact carbon copy

87
00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:54.120
every time you copy and send them to a new account.

88
00:05:54.120 --> 00:05:57.570
All right guys I think that's going to pretty much wrap up our coverage of Jarvi.

89
00:05:57.570 --> 00:06:02.490
I showed you the settings that I use for my account what I like.

90
00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:05.270
Keep in mind I tweak these often.

91
00:06:05.310 --> 00:06:05.640
OK.

92
00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.160
And it's something that you will want to tweak often as well and that's why earlier in the day on the

93
00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:15.720
zombie section I talked about the sweet spot of how many accounts you should have if you're only going

94
00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:16.770
to do five or ten.

95
00:06:16.770 --> 00:06:21.660
It's not worth it because the amount of work you have to do is significant.

96
00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:28.830
And as you add another 50 or another 20 or hundred you start using a lot of these settings like copy's

97
00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:35.820
settings over and just or even using things like creating the accounts like using the global tool account

98
00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:36.680
creation.

99
00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:40.040
So you're not going to have the same amount of maintenance time per new account.

100
00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:41.770
So you just keep that in mind.

101
00:06:41.790 --> 00:06:46.660
In general Jarvi is not like something you're going to pick up and figure out in the first 20 minutes.

102
00:06:46.680 --> 00:06:51.420
I give you a pretty big headstart because you can just copy my settings use when I'm using but keep

103
00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:53.090
in mind I changed quite a bit.

104
00:06:53.100 --> 00:06:54.000
I like to tweak.

105
00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.480
I like to experiment and then kind of see what's happening.

106
00:06:57.480 --> 00:06:57.870
All right guys.

107
00:06:57.870 --> 00:06:59.970
That being said I'll see you in the next hour.
