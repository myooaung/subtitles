00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:01,850
Hagar's Welcome back.

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:02,360
OK.

3
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:09,540
So this lecture we're going to talk about how to make logos very quickly for your zombie accounts.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,350
Those are really just kind of an extension of the strategy that we talked about in the first section

5
00:00:13,350 --> 00:00:15,780
where we talked about making logos.

6
00:00:15,840 --> 00:00:21,650
You obviously want to follow the same bits of advice that we had then about your logo be easy to understand.

7
00:00:21,650 --> 00:00:30,490
Having bright vibrant colors and generally you want something that's like an icon versus say text.

8
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:32,080
There's a lot of people use text.

9
00:00:32,080 --> 00:00:36,970
The problem is just that the thumbnail is so small that it can be pretty hard to read.

10
00:00:37,110 --> 00:00:41,490
So just keep in mind different ways that your profile image is going to be displayed.

11
00:00:41,820 --> 00:00:48,830
OK so if you guys are doing a personal account and you're making zombies your personal account Well

12
00:00:48,900 --> 00:00:51,930
then taking a profile photo is pretty straightforward.

13
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:58,710
Pick photos from actual post in your main account or pick photos that are very similar to the one you

14
00:00:58,710 --> 00:01:02,730
use in your main account something of if it's you always see of you.

15
00:01:02,730 --> 00:01:06,960
Now if it's your company and you want it to do zombies now I already said before I don't really suggest

16
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:08,360
doing that for your company.

17
00:01:08,490 --> 00:01:15,750
But what I generally suggest is taking your logo and using multiple varieties of colors Typically companies

18
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:20,120
or businesses will have one logo and then you can tweak the colors or tweak.

19
00:01:20,120 --> 00:01:26,340
Like for instance the name making an abbreviated or adding an icon to different kind of arrangements

20
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:26,990
like that.

21
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:33,920
And by just changing those small criteria you can create a good batch of logos that would make sense.

22
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:40,410
Now if you doing a themed account which you were doing for this course and I believe most people watching

23
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:44,760
probably are trying to do then here are my suggestions.

24
00:01:44,910 --> 00:01:48,090
So I really come down to two different things.

25
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:56,230
One as I like to use the same logo maker that we covered before and that shape factory.

26
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:01,140
Now the reason why is because they just have really good icons and really good colors and they do a

27
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:05,850
really good job of giving you lots of different variations to work with.

28
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:09,360
Now they're a little bit pricey right because there's like $40 a logo.

29
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,610
I think if he's at a discount it's down to like 30 something that's still a lot.

30
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:13,890
Right.

31
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,260
So I've heard him make 100 zombie accounts.

32
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:17,760
That would be a problem.

33
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:25,020
So what if I ended up doing actually was I use them but I would only buy a logo and then I would just

34
00:02:25,020 --> 00:02:28,160
save multiple variations of that logo.

35
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,420
So I would use different gradients and different colors for the icon.

36
00:02:32,820 --> 00:02:37,320
And out of each individual logo purchase I got like 10 different ones.

37
00:02:37,320 --> 00:02:38,650
So give me an example.

38
00:02:38,910 --> 00:02:39,890
Here's one of my zombies.

39
00:02:39,900 --> 00:02:40,410
Oh my God.

40
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:42,060
Technology.

41
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,980
So as you can see it's like yellow in the background and red in the foreground for the logo.

42
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:51,050
And then in the next one the newest attack it's just two different colors.

43
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:58,080
And typically I would just do this and get at least like eight to 10 logos So each individual one costs

44
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,750
like $3 and then I'm done.

45
00:03:00,790 --> 00:03:05,010
Now this probably isn't ideal if I were to create hundreds and hundreds of them because I would get

46
00:03:05,010 --> 00:03:09,120
pretty expensive pretty quickly if that were the case.

47
00:03:09,180 --> 00:03:13,830
What I would end up doing is probably doing one of two things.

48
00:03:13,830 --> 00:03:20,250
Well one thing you can do and this is viable if you are someone who's pretty comfortable using Photoshop

49
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:23,200
or using design tools even like scatch.

50
00:03:23,380 --> 00:03:32,640
What I'd say is go to the Noun Project Home and this is an open source icon repository where they just

51
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,220
have thousands and thousands of it's a million icons and they're all royalty free and they have them

52
00:03:38,310 --> 00:03:41,020
on anything you can think of.

53
00:03:41,060 --> 00:03:47,940
You know I said biology I would just get tons you know beakers and just genetics that doesn't make any

54
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:49,120
sense but all.

55
00:03:49,220 --> 00:03:52,290
So I could just scroll for days on this.

56
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:55,200
And these are all pretty relevant.

57
00:03:55,230 --> 00:04:00,240
So then what you would just do is pick one of these and say it's just the standard beaker.

58
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:02,560
And then I can say get this icon.

59
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:07,740
You have to create an account but it doesn't cost any money then you just download the royalty free

60
00:04:07,740 --> 00:04:09,060
version of it.

61
00:04:09,210 --> 00:04:13,240
Take that into Photoshop and then just play around with it there.

62
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,400
Keep in mind remember your profile needs to be 110 pixels by 110 pixels.

63
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:25,020
What I would usually do is just take this and then create a basic bright colored background and then

64
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:31,100
turn this white or keep it black or just change it to some color that has a nice contrast.

65
00:04:31,230 --> 00:04:33,420
Now that's a little too manual effort.

66
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:34,670
One other option.

67
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:38,370
You guys can do that I think is really useful is just use Kanva right.

68
00:04:38,370 --> 00:04:40,040
Canada is free.

69
00:04:40,050 --> 00:04:45,360
I have a paid version but it doesn't really give me anything that you wouldn't have in the free version.

70
00:04:45,720 --> 00:04:49,770
What you do is just go to Canada after you create a design.

71
00:04:49,780 --> 00:04:51,720
It'll give you all these templates you can choose from.

72
00:04:51,750 --> 00:04:54,010
Instead just go to use custom dimensions.

73
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:59,860
And here you can just type in 110 by 110 which is exactly what we need.

74
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:05,480
Then once it populates it they have tons and tons and tons of icons that are free that you can use or

75
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:11,390
even illustrations charts whatever and they all have pretty good color schemes right off the bat.

76
00:05:11,390 --> 00:05:18,590
So let's say I was trying to make a technology one so I don't know it's just a computer and see what

77
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:19,780
we get.

78
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:24,770
OK so we have a lot of flat design ones.

79
00:05:24,770 --> 00:05:29,540
I would probably stay away from these royalle these stock image ones just because those look pretty

80
00:05:29,540 --> 00:05:31,950
bizarre is a icon as a logo.

81
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,660
So I would probably pick and see something like that.

82
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:38,230
Like that's pretty simple.

83
00:05:38,270 --> 00:05:41,080
And then what I could do is just play around like background colors.

84
00:05:41,150 --> 00:05:46,340
So I do this is maybe just go to background over here and pick something in the background that I think

85
00:05:46,340 --> 00:05:51,770
contrasts well with it because remember we want to make sure that a thumbnail makes sense and sticks

86
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:52,530
out.

87
00:05:52,660 --> 00:05:57,360
I might even shrink this just because the way Instagram is going to display it.

88
00:05:57,740 --> 00:06:03,770
And then you know I can do as much as I want to it I can even go with like a funky background.

89
00:06:03,830 --> 00:06:05,740
Really go for contrast.

90
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:09,320
I think this is probably fine.

91
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:13,040
I might actually just go back to that solid colored one.

92
00:06:13,040 --> 00:06:17,660
And then if I wanted to edit the colors here it's just a matter of clicking it up here I can change

93
00:06:17,930 --> 00:06:20,170
the screen color to whatever I want.

94
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:22,950
I have a bunch of default palettes that I have.

95
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:26,990
But if you want custom colors you just press this plus button right here and then you can put in the

96
00:06:26,990 --> 00:06:31,160
hex code if you know it but you can also play it on this color wheel until you find something you like.

97
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,270
They don't say is again try to save yourself time to see the same icon to make multiple.

98
00:06:37,270 --> 00:06:39,940
So you can do this in a batch so just doesn't Garvie crazy.

99
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:50,380
But with Kanva there's hundreds and thousands of good quality flat or non-flat skew morphic design icons

100
00:06:50,410 --> 00:06:56,980
that I think you could pretty much go the distance with just takes a little bit of tweaking and uploading

101
00:06:56,980 --> 00:07:01,060
on to your profile and then pretty much from there you're all set.

102
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:06,820
So we did actually just take this and then upload it to the account that we were using before.

103
00:07:06,820 --> 00:07:11,680
I just want to spice it up just because I'm in a rocket right in the middle of it.

104
00:07:11,690 --> 00:07:15,300
Just to give it a little more visual signature.

105
00:07:15,430 --> 00:07:17,810
Not everybody likes rockets.

106
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:24,730
So it's even I don't think it has these snap grid lines that are super easy then appearing just get

107
00:07:24,730 --> 00:07:29,800
download does it really matter what file tape you use if you have a background that's blank then use

108
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:30,370
a PMG.

109
00:07:30,370 --> 00:07:33,430
But keep in mind Instagram's is going to convert your background to white.

110
00:07:33,430 --> 00:07:35,480
It doesn't actually give you transparency.

111
00:07:35,530 --> 00:07:39,310
So I could just go here back to the account when you create advanced technology today.

112
00:07:39,340 --> 00:07:44,590
But a mouthful that's fine because this is a numbers strategy going to change profile photo.

113
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:49,160
And we can upload our design and it pops up right there.

114
00:07:49,270 --> 00:07:50,590
That's a little raster.

115
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:55,470
So I might actually go back and try to increase the size of it.

116
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:02,970
Now the way you do that is actually pretty simple it's called The Magic resize there is no change dimensioned

117
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:05,070
is custom.

118
00:08:05,150 --> 00:08:07,840
So it's the

119
00:08:11,850 --> 00:08:13,770
read download it to J pay

120
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:21,330
OK and that's a little bit better.

121
00:08:21,390 --> 00:08:26,340
What I would do is I would resize this a little bit more just so it doesn't look like these tips or

122
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:28,270
the icons are hitting the edges.

123
00:08:28,500 --> 00:08:36,650
And I might blow it up a little bit larger just so it has a bit of a better resolution look to it.

124
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:43,950
Now this might just be the problem of having this on a web version web version is always larger than

125
00:08:43,950 --> 00:08:46,870
the mobile version so a lot of times it just stretches it out.

126
00:08:46,950 --> 00:08:49,680
But regardless that's something we can fix pretty easily.

127
00:08:49,680 --> 00:08:53,430
All right guys so in the next set of lectures what we're going to do is we're going be talking about

128
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:55,700
setting up a V-P ass.

129
00:08:55,740 --> 00:08:59,750
Now you just learn a VPN was earlier of an hour type of Piazza's.

130
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,320
Those are virtual private servers.

131
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:05,850
The reason why I want to set those up is so we can use an application called Jarvi which is going to

132
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:09,520
help us run our zombie accounts in bulk without going crazy.

133
00:09:09,520 --> 00:09:09,810
All right.

134
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:10,260
See it.
