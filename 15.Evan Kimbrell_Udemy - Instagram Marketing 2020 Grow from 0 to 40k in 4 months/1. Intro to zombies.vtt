00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:02.120
This you guys will come back to the course.

2
00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:09.950
So this lecture were going to deviate from the light side and go to the dark side a little bit.

3
00:00:10.110 --> 00:00:13.880
This section are going to cover something that is pretty black hat.

4
00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:18.300
Now if you couldn't tolerate the bots are definitely not going to tolerate the zombies so I suggest

5
00:00:18.300 --> 00:00:23.130
you just skip on to the next section where we're going to do is we're going to create zombie accounts

6
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:23.850
now.

7
00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:29.550
Essentially what this is is we're going to create what are called Fan Page accounts and there are a

8
00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.280
lot of accounts out there that do this.

9
00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:40.240
Most large accounts for say like sports accounts or modeling or lifestyle.

10
00:00:40.380 --> 00:00:47.070
They all use this tactic and you'll see it constantly when you go to the search section you search someone's

11
00:00:47.070 --> 00:00:51.950
name and then all of a sudden you notice there's a lot of really good accounts for whatever reason.

12
00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:57.990
If you go to a social media agency this is actually what they do they charge you tens of thousands of

13
00:00:57.990 --> 00:01:01.950
dollars and they just make zombie accounts and then manage them.

14
00:01:01.950 --> 00:01:03.110
It's kind of crazy.

15
00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:06.660
So what we're to do in this section is we're going to explore this and it's totally up to you if you

16
00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:11.340
want to use this tactic in some cases it works really well in some cases it doesn't.

17
00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:15.900
And we're going to introduce a new tool called Jarvi and this is something that we're actually going

18
00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:23.850
to set up in the cloud by opening up a VPN virtual private server so that it can run 24/7.

19
00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:27.250
Now this will allow us to manage a whole lot of accounts.

20
00:01:27.660 --> 00:01:32.340
And then we're going to follow kind of the best practices have to make sure they run well and they're

21
00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:38.580
effective and how exactly we can make these random zombies roam the earth and somehow benefit us in

22
00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:39.170
some way.

23
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:44.580
And yeah I realize this is a bit obscure but if you want to be competitive on Instagram you got to know

24
00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:49.500
all the skills because other people are doing it so you should at least have the option of doing it

25
00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:50.200
yourself.

26
00:01:50.370 --> 00:01:53.010
That being said I will see you in the next lecture.
