1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:02,540
Hey everybody welcome back.

2
00:00:02,640 --> 00:00:09,840
So I'm going to check in again now that we're at 45000 followers and give you an update on where we're

3
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:15,810
at what seems to be making the account grow and then giving you an update on a pretty big change we've

4
00:00:15,810 --> 00:00:22,770
switched from manual posting to probably say like 95 percent automated posting.

5
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:28,830
OK so here's the account we're at forty five point six thousand looks decently good.

6
00:00:28,860 --> 00:00:31,680
We'll look at our iconic square to look at the day rates.

7
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:36,120
OK so in a kind of square you can kind of see that for the last week.

8
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:37,520
Our growth has slowed quite a bit.

9
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:45,240
We 70 29 88 89 215 and then that those two zeros are just because I Kano's who are constantly keeps

10
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,990
re authenticating and when it riata indicates it forgets what it had before so it will say zero.

11
00:00:51,990 --> 00:00:55,980
Like for instance one day told me that I lost $45000 that obviously that wasn't the case.

12
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,180
But you can see that last week we actually had a pretty good tear are going to 84.

13
00:01:01,220 --> 00:01:05,310
159 1 2 3 1 2 4 2 6 183.

14
00:01:05,310 --> 00:01:11,940
I mean for me anything over 150 I think is a solid growth rate especially considering that I'm not creating

15
00:01:11,940 --> 00:01:13,830
the lowest common denominator account.

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:21,210
I'm not just posting viral videos that are all fake and clearly just designed for people to share without

17
00:01:21,210 --> 00:01:25,620
even watching the video I'm actually trying to do something that's a little better so I'm perfectly

18
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:27,380
fine accepting a lower growth rate.

19
00:01:27,590 --> 00:01:34,020
But anyway so the shift downward towards the 60s towards these like sub hundred that had to do with

20
00:01:34,020 --> 00:01:36,280
our automation and all explain that here in a bit.

21
00:01:36,630 --> 00:01:41,340
We were really turning to testing things out as are switching from manual to automated.

22
00:01:41,470 --> 00:01:44,410
And so at first it wasn't working out so Karaite.

23
00:01:44,670 --> 00:01:52,260
But for the most part what I've noticed with our growth is that it's really hash tag or explore page

24
00:01:52,350 --> 00:01:53,210
or die.

25
00:01:53,430 --> 00:01:53,700
Right.

26
00:01:53,700 --> 00:02:02,640
So if you look at our posts they are either viewed by 2000 to 4000 people or the hash tag pages which

27
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:07,390
will bring them to 40000 50000 people and in some cases they'll have the explore page which will bring

28
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,830
them to 100000 people almost pretty much all of our growth comes from those hashtags and explore page

29
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:19,980
hits whereas the other ones are just kind of duds and that's perfectly fine because I just really started

30
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:24,660
reposting all of the old stuff that we started at the very beginning and the accounts were cycling through

31
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:28,200
and already know that something is a kind of duds like they didn't do well the first time I don't know

32
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:34,290
why they do well the second time but I'm not trying to do just the best hit strategy like I was doing

33
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,040
earlier but a month ago I just it's not really sustainable if you don't have that much content.

34
00:02:39,330 --> 00:02:43,240
Later on I think we'll switch to doing better posts only.

35
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:45,320
It's just a balance right.

36
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,950
We post everything that we can post for four months without people seeing the same content but if we

37
00:02:49,950 --> 00:02:55,060
switch to like the best only or as say like the top core tile then you know we only last a month so

38
00:02:55,070 --> 00:02:58,330
it just depends on how long people's memories are.

39
00:02:58,470 --> 00:03:05,100
So OK I'll show you kind of examples like let's see ok so like this stretchy battery.

40
00:03:05,100 --> 00:03:05,480
Right.

41
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:09,510
I think it's interesting but I only got 4000 views so if you look at how many followers came from it

42
00:03:09,900 --> 00:03:10,820
literally zero.

43
00:03:10,820 --> 00:03:15,480
All right only 12 people click through and you can see Instagram's diagram didn't like this post because

44
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,320
I only got 4 percent viewing from people who weren't already following me.

45
00:03:19,390 --> 00:03:22,940
But we look at let's say a different one.

46
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:26,640
So here I don't know why this one was more popular.

47
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:31,450
It's like a farm in a box kind of thing as you can see more people were commenting on it.

48
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:35,250
Most people just love the idea or hate the idea.

49
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:39,240
I mean that's pretty much the divide in our comments and then for the most part I just kind of stimulate

50
00:03:39,240 --> 00:03:42,640
discussion by trolling people to view insights.

51
00:03:42,780 --> 00:03:47,670
So 419 people came from that and you can see 87 percent weren't following me.

52
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,950
So I got $171 just from that post.

53
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:53,340
Now if you look at the breakdown now it hit the Explorer page.

54
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,320
So that's where Tony 2000 came it might have been a local explore page where it didn't show to a ton

55
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:06,960
of people but people who'd already shown an interest in technology or innovation got it shown from other.

56
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:09,490
That is a hard number to figure out.

57
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,670
It's like a breakdown of how many people share it through direct message.

58
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:20,640
It's just kind of odd where those come from it's just every everything else.

59
00:04:20,640 --> 00:04:25,410
So what ends up happening is a lot of our views are from people deeming it to other people.

60
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:28,460
So that is a portion of where that's coming from.

61
00:04:28,470 --> 00:04:33,210
But some of it I still am not entirely sure and I don't think Instagram even knows because they're not

62
00:04:33,210 --> 00:04:35,070
even willing to share where that came from.

63
00:04:35,070 --> 00:04:36,570
So let's see.

64
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:37,480
Let's look at this.

65
00:04:37,490 --> 00:04:38,400
Bjorn.

66
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:40,450
Remember this was C. 2000 views.

67
00:04:40,450 --> 00:04:43,860
OK so this is just a dud again toll profile visits no one followed.

68
00:04:44,010 --> 00:04:50,460
Then this whatever this hotel that was completely green and it gives energy back to the grid got us

69
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:51,270
160.

70
00:04:51,300 --> 00:04:51,490
Right.

71
00:04:51,490 --> 00:04:55,890
And if we look at it again this one had the explore page a little bit more 74000 users from the explore

72
00:04:55,890 --> 00:04:56,510
page.

73
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,730
Cool.

74
00:04:57,870 --> 00:05:04,420
There was one that really just blew up this one for whatever reason it's just this thing that floats

75
00:05:04,420 --> 00:05:08,250
in the water and it uses tidal changes to generate electricity.

76
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:14,470
I don't know why it's so popular but we got almost $400 from it 150 3000.

77
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:16,400
So it really just hit the explore page.

78
00:05:16,420 --> 00:05:18,390
You'll notice 21000 from other.

79
00:05:18,390 --> 00:05:21,620
And that's again like people sharing it.

80
00:05:21,730 --> 00:05:27,330
And again I don't even know but it really hit the explore page and just did well from there.

81
00:05:27,370 --> 00:05:30,040
So that's really where we got the distribution on that one.

82
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:35,770
And if you notice any of them any comments is only 18 comments so a lot of students are messaging me

83
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:38,520
which is kind of funny that we have students now following the count.

84
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,230
But one of the questions is Why do you have so few comments versus how big your account is.

85
00:05:44,290 --> 00:05:45,960
And honestly I don't know.

86
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:48,650
I mean it's kind of the way that this works.

87
00:05:48,790 --> 00:05:53,590
It's kind of passive and we haven't really figured out an optimized strategy for getting comments.

88
00:05:53,590 --> 00:05:56,540
Sue we do get comments but it's like a bad post.

89
00:05:56,540 --> 00:06:03,520
We're going to get four or five a good one might get up to 30 or 40 but it just that's not really what's

90
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:04,930
getting us or distribution.

91
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,020
So that's something we kind of optimize in the future.

92
00:06:07,030 --> 00:06:12,070
But the moment seems like the hash tag pages the Explore pages are doing plenty.

93
00:06:12,070 --> 00:06:14,190
Here's another one that did pretty well.

94
00:06:14,450 --> 00:06:17,260
This again I think it did well because people hated it.

95
00:06:17,260 --> 00:06:21,580
It's a clip you put on your body and it tells you when you're bending over incorrectly and it helps

96
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:27,010
you prevent injury so virtually all the questions were like I know how to bend over.

97
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:28,940
That's not a problem.

98
00:06:29,020 --> 00:06:29,800
And whatever.

99
00:06:29,830 --> 00:06:34,020
That's fine if people don't like it they're going to comment and that still pushes it up the algorithm

100
00:06:34,030 --> 00:06:37,310
so I'm perfectly happy to facilitate that rage.

101
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:43,630
Again this one for whatever reason it's from other which I think in the Q&amp;A section I'll do a little

102
00:06:43,630 --> 00:06:48,280
bit more of a deep dive into what other is but for the most part with the newest Instagram it's kind

103
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:49,380
of a mystery.

104
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:52,750
This one for whatever reason it's literally conquered it's just mud.

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:06:55,130
And for some reason it did really well.

106
00:06:55,170 --> 00:06:56,740
Got a $136 from it.

107
00:06:56,740 --> 00:07:00,290
But then you just noticed it's really just hot or cold or hot or cold.

108
00:07:00,310 --> 00:07:01,540
This one again.

109
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:04,280
Nothing like 32 you got one follower from that.

110
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:05,100
OK.

111
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:06,880
So that's pretty much where we're at.

112
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:14,650
It's hash tag page or explore page or die and it really it ends up being pretty consistent.

113
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:20,660
I know that on any given day one of these will hit and that's going to get most of our follows from.

114
00:07:20,770 --> 00:07:25,150
OK now let's switch over to look at the Jarvi setup we have for automation.

115
00:07:25,380 --> 00:07:25,680
Right.

116
00:07:25,690 --> 00:07:27,950
So we will jump into the yes.

117
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:34,750
All right so the basic idea was that you know before we had someone who was manually posting all war

118
00:07:34,750 --> 00:07:36,940
posts every single day and they're in us time zones.

119
00:07:36,940 --> 00:07:41,110
That's where my audience is and I wanted to get off of that because that was expensive and that was

120
00:07:41,110 --> 00:07:42,490
the goal all along.

121
00:07:42,490 --> 00:07:49,240
So now what we've done is we use Jarvi and we use the campaign section where we've been doing is using

122
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,120
a combination of there scraping tools to just scrape our posts and then also I just had a virtual assistant

123
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,580
load them all up and then we just set them up in the post section.

124
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:08,420
So let's look at here we go active and then you can look over here and the post lists.

125
00:08:08,420 --> 00:08:11,620
So we have everything listed out here.

126
00:08:11,660 --> 00:08:13,000
You load them up.

127
00:08:13,070 --> 00:08:20,210
Sorry juries really slow you load them up here in the drafts and you'll load the comments along with

128
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:26,090
it and then essentially it ends up happening is we just click them and send them to the post list and

129
00:08:26,090 --> 00:08:27,300
then change the order.

130
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:32,720
So the first issue that I was really struggling with was the reason why I didn't automate it any time

131
00:08:32,720 --> 00:08:42,740
sooner was how do I preserve the two videos one image post system because if that breaks down then the

132
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,560
whole aesthetic of using the quotes kind of goes away.

133
00:08:46,820 --> 00:08:48,070
And that was a concern.

134
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:53,180
So the way we manage it is just by doing it here like we just will set the number.

135
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:53,950
And you'll notice.

136
00:08:53,960 --> 00:08:55,100
You can just do it manually.

137
00:08:55,110 --> 00:08:58,720
So zeros the first one want the next two is the maximum three.

138
00:08:58,730 --> 00:09:01,690
So it just posts automatically in that order.

139
00:09:01,820 --> 00:09:05,230
Then all we do is when to publish and you just set it up here.

140
00:09:05,230 --> 00:09:12,430
So right now I think it's only for posting a day and we're still kind of tweaking things but we haven't

141
00:09:12,470 --> 00:09:18,800
during the set times and then these were just times that we had noticed that we get a decent amount

142
00:09:18,890 --> 00:09:26,630
of interaction during this needs to be optimized so I don't think 8 a.m. is the ideal point to post

143
00:09:26,630 --> 00:09:26,850
this.

144
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:32,250
You also get to keep in mind that it's based on the time of year.

145
00:09:32,690 --> 00:09:37,090
So this is 144 which is west coast time.

146
00:09:37,090 --> 00:09:40,100
All right so we just had to set it up that way.

147
00:09:40,100 --> 00:09:44,870
Realistically probably push this one an hour forward but with Icona square I can go there and look at

148
00:09:44,870 --> 00:09:49,640
the reach and look at the gauge and see what are the best times and by doing that I can come back here

149
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:54,650
and tweak it and ideally see a little bit more reach and engagement.

150
00:09:54,650 --> 00:09:56,140
So here is pretty straightforward.

151
00:09:56,150 --> 00:09:58,420
We'll bump it up to 5 to get back to where we were originally.

152
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:02,050
But right now we're kind of keeping it low where to publish.

153
00:10:02,060 --> 00:10:07,200
You just set up a destination or just set it up as an evasion station really simple just one wall.

154
00:10:07,310 --> 00:10:09,010
Okay let's look back over at the draft.

155
00:10:09,030 --> 00:10:09,380
No.

156
00:10:09,410 --> 00:10:15,620
The other issue that comes with automation is do you guys remember my posting pattern it was that I'd

157
00:10:15,620 --> 00:10:22,220
post a caption and then the hash tags and then three comments or two comments of a Moji to hide it.

158
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:25,020
OK well we can do that.

159
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:29,840
But it's hard to automate the emoji and have them non-generic.

160
00:10:29,840 --> 00:10:36,380
So that was kind of an issue and really the only way we solved it was just by when we added all of these

161
00:10:36,380 --> 00:10:37,430
into the drafts.

162
00:10:37,580 --> 00:10:41,340
We just went and manually put it in and put in him.

163
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,330
From what they were before and the way that you do the comments is by using their spend tax settings.

164
00:10:47,330 --> 00:10:50,940
So this year it says the little brackets and it says comment.

165
00:10:50,960 --> 00:10:52,720
So it's just called a token.

166
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,790
So if you add tokens you can do Khama and the way it treats the information is that anything after this

167
00:10:58,790 --> 00:11:01,540
token will go in the comments.

168
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,160
So you can set it up so they can do multiple comments.

169
00:11:05,300 --> 00:11:09,170
Again it's just you have to spend a lot of time tweaking this.

170
00:11:09,170 --> 00:11:12,730
We also added the locations and that was unfortunately just a manual.

171
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,870
And if you go to Instagram advanced options you can add locations for each one.

172
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:24,350
Again it's frustrating to put all of this stuff in at once but once it's in there it's pretty much done.

173
00:11:24,350 --> 00:11:28,240
It's just going to run and all you have to do is check in to make sure it post correctly.

174
00:11:28,250 --> 00:11:33,950
So yeah I mean that's pretty much the basic setting we have we have nothing to take care of stories

175
00:11:33,950 --> 00:11:34,830
right now.

176
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,510
So Jervy has a setting that when it publishes a post you can set it so it says also post this as a story

177
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:42,570
that would be perfect.

178
00:11:42,590 --> 00:11:45,710
But when it does that it kind of comes out funky.

179
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:49,770
It ends up publishing it all wonky with like bars at the top and bottom.

180
00:11:50,030 --> 00:11:52,070
And it's not ideal.

181
00:11:52,070 --> 00:11:54,230
So we're still trying to figure out the best way to do stories.

182
00:11:54,230 --> 00:11:59,420
The good thing is that stories are incredibly easy to do since Instagram has that share feature for

183
00:11:59,420 --> 00:12:00,190
stories.

184
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:05,390
So really all I have to do is just take each post at the end of the day and just click share on each

185
00:12:05,390 --> 00:12:07,820
one and it creates that little preview box.

186
00:12:07,970 --> 00:12:10,760
And I put a hash argument to it and I don't even do that again.

187
00:12:10,770 --> 00:12:16,100
The virtual assistant does that and it takes her 10 minutes a day it's really nothing.

188
00:12:16,100 --> 00:12:19,700
So if you look at our history or here we can see what's been posted.

189
00:12:19,700 --> 00:12:27,180
We can very easily set this up so we automatically send new history posts to bomp or over here.

190
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:29,420
Riadh publish posts into the post list.

191
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:34,550
What we could do is if we just added every single post we ever had all we'd have to do is just check

192
00:12:34,550 --> 00:12:39,620
that box and then it would automatically cycle so I wouldn't have to check in three months later and

193
00:12:39,620 --> 00:12:43,940
reload them again so I can just hit that and I'll just automatically do it.

194
00:12:43,940 --> 00:12:47,330
Now I'm not going to do that just because ideally I'd like to have a little bit more control over what

195
00:12:47,330 --> 00:12:53,090
gets posted if something sucks than I'd prefer to just remove it and further down the line try to optimize

196
00:12:53,090 --> 00:12:53,840
our post schedule.

197
00:12:53,840 --> 00:12:59,310
So even over here we can see create a report and you know for the most part.

198
00:12:59,480 --> 00:13:00,820
Works pretty straightforward.

199
00:13:00,830 --> 00:13:02,520
All right so that's what we're at.

200
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,540
It's our automation strategy is working.

201
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:08,300
It did take a hit at first with followers.

202
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:09,160
Why.

203
00:13:09,380 --> 00:13:12,350
It's been a little inconsistent especially in your getting the settings right.

204
00:13:12,350 --> 00:13:16,460
One thing we are running into is that since Jarvis is doing all of the posting and doesn't really like

205
00:13:16,460 --> 00:13:18,350
that because it acts like a bot.

206
00:13:18,350 --> 00:13:23,650
So when it's Graham thinks it's a bot and keeps walking you out and occasionally unscrambled even grabs

207
00:13:23,650 --> 00:13:27,800
some of the posts we make for some reason it's always the image post and then remove them and screws

208
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:32,890
up our design and so we kind of had to keep going back and figuring out and figuring out the solution.

209
00:13:33,020 --> 00:13:38,780
For now was actually to go to Jarvi and change or follow bought settings because our follow bot was

210
00:13:38,780 --> 00:13:42,440
bringing in followers and it's a good thing to have that we had it maxed out.

211
00:13:42,440 --> 00:13:47,120
So I had it so that it was falling like 300 people a day or something.

212
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:51,070
And I think that was just kind of pissing off Instagram.

213
00:13:51,110 --> 00:13:53,020
It just looks very odd to be doing that.

214
00:13:53,020 --> 00:13:55,720
And then also having a bot post everything for you.

215
00:13:55,730 --> 00:14:02,570
So I kind of went here and just tinkered with this such that it would only do about 67 follows per day

216
00:14:02,580 --> 00:14:08,450
and then once we get out of the woods where we're not having a lot of issues with Instagram taking our

217
00:14:08,450 --> 00:14:11,540
post then I'll start cranking this back up.

218
00:14:11,540 --> 00:14:15,030
It might also be a case of it's not really worth getting this back up to 300 again.

219
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:20,990
How many conversions we get you know out of 67 and only gives me probably 10 followers a day at that

220
00:14:21,020 --> 00:14:23,330
300 is only going to mean maybe 30.

221
00:14:23,330 --> 00:14:26,930
So it's just something that you kind of have to balance.

222
00:14:26,930 --> 00:14:28,020
All right guys that's where we're at.

223
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:30,650
I'd say right now it's pretty much like 95 percent automation.

224
00:14:30,650 --> 00:14:32,900
It's just me checking in to see what is going on.

225
00:14:32,900 --> 00:14:38,300
I still comment on the post just because I think it's kind of funny but also it really does help with

226
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,370
engagement especially if you see a post doing well.

227
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:46,010
You can see the and the reviews like so if we posted two hours later it's already at say like six thousand

228
00:14:46,010 --> 00:14:46,560
a reach.

229
00:14:46,700 --> 00:14:52,130
Then I'll start commenting in there and even posting unsolicited comments for me that just kind of helps

230
00:14:52,130 --> 00:14:56,990
it push it along and ideally you know if you get enough people participating you can have the explore

231
00:14:56,990 --> 00:14:59,510
page and that's how you then get those posts to do really well.

232
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:00,040
All right cool.

233
00:15:00,050 --> 00:15:00,920
So that's where we're at.

234
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:06,800
I'll check in again probably around 50000 and hopefully at that point the automation system will be

235
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:08,400
100 percent going.

236
00:15:08,420 --> 00:15:12,110
And this is something that I'm not going to spend really any time on.

237
00:15:12,170 --> 00:15:15,740
Once it's set up the idea is just it's you know it's ready to go.

238
00:15:15,740 --> 00:15:17,070
And I don't have to touch anything.

239
00:15:17,090 --> 00:15:22,430
I'm obviously not doing literally I mean anything besides playing with comments and checking the posts.

240
00:15:22,430 --> 00:15:25,770
But still you know any work is more work than I have to.

241
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:27,170
So that's what I'm shooting for.

242
00:15:27,170 --> 00:15:27,730
All right guys.

243
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:29,730
See you in the next checkup.
