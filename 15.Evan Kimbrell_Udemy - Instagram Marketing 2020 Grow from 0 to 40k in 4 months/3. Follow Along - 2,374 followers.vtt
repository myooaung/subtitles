00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:01.520
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.560 --> 00:00:04.300
OK so this is day nine.

3
00:00:04.320 --> 00:00:08.410
I want to say and nine or 10.

4
00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.290
And we are at about twenty to three hundred followers.

5
00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:18.570
OK so I want to check in and show you what I've been doing in the last like two or three days not entirely

6
00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:25.710
sure I'm traveling in Europe while I'm doing this so the check ins or less frequent ones are not doing

7
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:28.460
as much as I could so we're growing a lot faster.

8
00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:34.440
But that's probably not realistic to expect a lot of you guys out there to just go crazy at this every

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:36.390
single day for 10 hours.

10
00:00:36.450 --> 00:00:39.720
Really I'm spending probably 30 minutes or an hour a day tops.

11
00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:44.160
And then every three or four days then spending a little chunk of time working on something and the

12
00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:45.620
next thing that we want to do.

13
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:52.830
OK so as you can see here last time I think we checked in I was around to say 3300 fall or something

14
00:00:52.830 --> 00:00:53.240
like that.

15
00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.530
But you can see that there has been a massive ramp up.

16
00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:59.300
So 3300 to 23:00.

17
00:00:59.310 --> 00:01:03.410
And then this I think this is just a time zone issue.

18
00:01:03.420 --> 00:01:05.740
So that should actually.

19
00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:06.510
Yeah.

20
00:01:06.690 --> 00:01:14.130
Anyway so what happened on the first between the first and the second was that actually ran multiple

21
00:01:14.130 --> 00:01:18.120
paid promotions and it was just a matter of timing actually.

22
00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:23.310
So I've been going through a lot of accounts and just messaging them the same thing over and over again

23
00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:30.470
as you can see and all I've been doing is saying hey do you do shout outs so you know how much first

24
00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:31.260
shout out.

25
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:32.580
And then let's see.

26
00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:34.000
Do you do paid shout out.

27
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:37.410
I was doing was just going to one of these accounts so say.

28
00:01:37.410 --> 00:01:38.540
Interesting engineering.

29
00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:40.430
We'll see if we can get to their account.

30
00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:45.540
And then looking at the suggested tabs here the suggested tab and then just gives you tons and tons

31
00:01:45.540 --> 00:01:46.170
and tons of these.

32
00:01:46.170 --> 00:01:55.620
So I was kind of going off of the engineering science physics and some tech gadget kind of threads and

33
00:01:55.620 --> 00:02:00.540
then grabbing people and then messaging minority response rates probably 30 percent.

34
00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:04.870
But I can send 50 of these messages in probably an hour or so.

35
00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:06.250
It's not particularly hard.

36
00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:10.350
Now of the response I got so this person can do it.

37
00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:21.960
So they said 40 for a post 15 for a story 190000 would end up doing was working with this account so

38
00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:22.740
inspiring.

39
00:02:22.750 --> 00:02:23.320
Doh.

40
00:02:23.370 --> 00:02:29.430
And they had two accounts ended up happening is we actually just posted multiple things together.

41
00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:39.260
So I did a story post with inspiring us and there Acosta was See I believe they were 30.

42
00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.070
I mean their prices.

43
00:02:41.090 --> 00:02:43.780
Yes I did a promo for a story shout out.

44
00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:45.630
Yes it was 20 bucks.

45
00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.070
They didn't actually do a post for me.

46
00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:55.450
And then their partner account or the account that they also operate was called entrepreneur quotes.

47
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:00.620
So this one and up paying them through it through Paypal.

48
00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:06.930
So let's say I did a post and a story with them so that was 40 20.

49
00:03:06.950 --> 00:03:10.420
I think that ended up being a 60 or 70.

50
00:03:10.770 --> 00:03:16.520
OK so what they did is they posted stories and they did that.

51
00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:17.520
It was just bizarre.

52
00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:22.050
They originally were supposed to post it on the same day and I could measure how well it worked but

53
00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.720
it didn't have happening was the guy just had problems with his account he couldn't post so it delayed

54
00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.760
it by a couple of days.

55
00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.000
He kept saying like I can't post my counts like locked out.

56
00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.690
This guy was and that he couldn't get any of the things I was sending him and blah blah blah blah blah.

57
00:03:36.980 --> 00:03:40.110
So wouldn't it happening as he finally did it and then he posted these stories.

58
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:43.480
Well I had already scheduled another post with another one grand attack.

59
00:03:43.490 --> 00:03:48.100
Remember this one had done this on before and they posted the exact same time.

60
00:03:48.110 --> 00:03:52.850
So I believe this was theirs.

61
00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.880
Let's see where was it a repost of another one of mine.

62
00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.700
And yeah that was it.

63
00:04:00.700 --> 00:04:05.670
Maybe they just remove the actual reference to it.

64
00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:11.410
So they did it the same exact time and then I did a brilliant invention's post and that one also bows

65
00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.280
at the same time.

66
00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:17.840
So if I want to be really and then and zoom in those just gigantic cost $90 to do it.

67
00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:19.280
But it was obviously worth it.

68
00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:25.330
So this was the one that I posted where on self-checkouts they wouldn't let me upload videos so I message

69
00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.780
this account and I was like can I give you videos I think videos are better.

70
00:04:28.850 --> 00:04:29.720
They never responded.

71
00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:34.690
Eventually they did respond but way too late senator doing was just taking a screen shot and then adding

72
00:04:34.690 --> 00:04:37.550
a fake video icon to the top right.

73
00:04:37.570 --> 00:04:42.030
And then it is a really simple caption like who doesn't want three arms go to of the station watch video

74
00:04:42.040 --> 00:04:43.710
crazy.

75
00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:46.000
And that one did really really well.

76
00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.740
So I noticed a huge uptick once this one posted.

77
00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:55.020
And I think it's just because of the simplicity and then it drove a lot of people to my page.

78
00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:58.780
And then a lot of people just started liking a lot of different things.

79
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:03.570
You see a lot of people doing multiple at a time and that's good.

80
00:05:03.580 --> 00:05:09.140
And that really helped with the engagement distribution of my posts.

81
00:05:09.310 --> 00:05:11.190
So that worked out decently well.

82
00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:20.830
The goal right now is to get to about 5000 followers with paid or other easier ways of promotion.

83
00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:24.910
Because at that point then I can start doing shout outs.

84
00:05:24.970 --> 00:05:29.780
It's hard for instance to go to an account that has 2000 followers and say you want to do a shout for

85
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:34.480
shout because they just don't really care it's not going to drive that much attention per the amount

86
00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:36.700
of effort it's going to take.

87
00:05:36.700 --> 00:05:39.160
So I think 5000 is probably good entry point.

88
00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:43.120
I can find a lot of 5000 people accounts or 10000 and I can work with that.

89
00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.040
But until that point there's not a whole lot I can do on that front.

90
00:05:47.110 --> 00:05:50.650
Once I get to 5000 then I'll actually switch and start doing other things.

91
00:05:50.650 --> 00:05:57.160
Now the other thing I did was on the content side I started hiring a another virtual assistant to help

92
00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:04.690
manage the process of posting because the main virtual assistant is kind of overloaded and we need to

93
00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:09.360
move on to the next step which is stories so down that we actually have some followers.

94
00:06:09.370 --> 00:06:13.780
We have our post-process down there awareness are working on stories.

95
00:06:13.930 --> 00:06:20.260
I've already made some promotional stories and I'm sure I've showed you these before you've probably

96
00:06:20.260 --> 00:06:22.230
seen these indep looking like this.

97
00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:29.630
You can see the inspiring DOS and they have a story and then so I just did this fast paced

98
00:06:32.920 --> 00:06:38.680
video that quickly shows a bunch of things that we cover and it uses kind of this techno theme to it.

99
00:06:38.980 --> 00:06:44.950
And then what happens is it cuts to another page it says follow for tech and trends and scroll up see

100
00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:47.240
more scroll up just takes you to my account.

101
00:06:47.290 --> 00:06:47.630
OK.

102
00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:53.770
So did that with two different accounts and it worked out decently well stories are pretty cheap so

103
00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:59.250
I might stick to that but now I have to devise a scheme for how we're going to do stories.

104
00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:08.110
Now my idea for stories so far is just to just make it simple and every day we'll just post a shorter

105
00:07:08.110 --> 00:07:09.930
version of each video.

106
00:07:09.970 --> 00:07:19.570
So the video is you know 40 30 seconds 40 seconds 45 seconds or so max Being a minute but the longest

107
00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:21.760
story you can make is 15 seconds.

108
00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.030
All right.

109
00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:24.880
So we talked about this in the story section.

110
00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.340
So what I'm going to try to do is just make shorter faster versions of it so you can kind of get the

111
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:30.920
hits.

112
00:07:31.030 --> 00:07:36.010
And I was thinking was putting a screen at the very beginning it says which one is your favorite or

113
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:39.310
saying top three of the day or top five of the day.

114
00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:43.280
Or even just innovations of the day something like that something that people can do rapidly.

115
00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.340
And I think that's pretty easy to do.

116
00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:49.150
So it's just one more thing for the editors to do is just as opposed to making a 45 minute one to make

117
00:07:49.150 --> 00:07:54.600
a 45 minute one and say like a 10 second one really fast clip one.

118
00:07:54.940 --> 00:07:55.430
OK.

119
00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:57.610
So that's pretty much where I'm at.

120
00:07:57.610 --> 00:08:01.720
I'm going to continue with paid promotions until we get to that 5000.

121
00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:04.360
It's just a matter of managing them.

122
00:08:04.360 --> 00:08:08.810
If I had a little bit of time what I could do is message more people and and manage more paid promotions

123
00:08:08.810 --> 00:08:10.160
so I could get there a lot faster.

124
00:08:10.180 --> 00:08:13.660
But I can only do so much at a time.

125
00:08:13.810 --> 00:08:15.630
So that's how we're going to do going to get to stories.

126
00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.260
And at the moment I'm working on getting that other virtual assistant up to speed they've actually been

127
00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:21.650
posting on the dummy account.

128
00:08:21.850 --> 00:08:28.240
So you can see where they've been posting these just practicing getting the captions right and hashtags

129
00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.500
right once they're ready then they'll start taking over for that then we'll move on to stories and sometimes

130
00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:38.460
stories then we'll start moving on to shout for shouts and then automating our outreach.

131
00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:45.600
And then we'll probably start integrating live videos for weekly giveaways and then we'll probably round

132
00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:52.090
it off with the zombies which I need to make sure that I have a lot of resources available to manage

133
00:08:52.090 --> 00:08:56.570
that so I need at least one person to help go through that process with me.

134
00:08:56.740 --> 00:09:01.360
That's probably going to be the biggest growth factor I'm predicting but it's further down on the road

135
00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:01.830
map.

136
00:09:01.900 --> 00:09:04.550
So okay that's where we're at.

137
00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:06.900
I'll see you guys next time and have a second to check it.
