Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,950 --> 00:00:04,370
Let's talk about image sizing and what to do
2

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:09,540
so you don't accidentally crash Instagram's servers by
submitting a triangle photo, or even worse, a photo in 4K.
3

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:10,240
so you don't accidentally crash Instagram's servers by
submitting a triangle photo, or even worse, a photo in 4K.
4

5
00:00:10,260 --> 00:00:11,080
Oh my God.
5

6
00:00:11,310 --> 00:00:11,550
All right.
6

7
00:00:11,550 --> 00:00:15,220
First off, in case you forgot, how big should our images be?
7

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:16,830
Is anyone paying attention?
8

9
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:18,320
We already talked about this actually,
9

10
00:00:18,390 --> 00:00:19,770
and you should probably know.
10

11
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:20,730
Believe it or not.
11

12
00:00:20,730 --> 00:00:22,570
Or maybe we didn't, and I'm just crazy,
12

13
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:23,520
Or maybe we didn't, and I'm just crazy,
13

14
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:27,870
which actually could be a legitimate possibility, you kind
of lose track of things when you're making courses.
14

15
00:00:27,870 --> 00:00:28,500
which actually could be a legitimate possibility, you kind
of lose track of things when you're making courses.
15

16
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,330
Now, we want it to be 1080x1080.
16

17
00:00:31,440 --> 00:00:32,410
That's a square.
17

18
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:34,810
It's also what's considered full HD.
18

19
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:42,630
An easy way to remember this is, I don't know, whatever
number you associate with HDTV which is 1080p.
19

20
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:46,960
If you think it's 720, just slap yourself,
because that's not technically HD anymore.
20

21
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:52,830
Now, that's essentially what we're going for,
an HD image. Now, does it display 1080x1080
21

22
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:55,990
on the screen? Anybody who's done this on their
computer, you probably noticed immediately.
22

23
00:00:56,010 --> 00:00:57,440
on the screen? Anybody who's done this on their
computer, you probably noticed immediately.
23

24
00:00:57,450 --> 00:00:58,620
That's a huge image.
24

25
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:00,000
It's not like your phone.
25

26
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:00,600
Well, guess what?
26

27
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:07,830
No, actually on mobile displays it displays as 600x600,
and even on the web version it seems like something
27

28
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:10,610
like 600x600 is the cap as well.
28

29
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:16,260
So then why exactly do we do it in almost
double that display resolution?
29

30
00:01:16,260 --> 00:01:21,870
Now, one of the reasons is that when it's downscaled,
which is a fancy term for shrunk down, it'll come out
30

31
00:01:21,930 --> 00:01:23,400
as a sharper image.
31

32
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:29,010
And the other reason is that Instagram actually stores your
image on their servers in a duplicate copy as 1080x1080,
32

33
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:31,130
And the other reason is that Instagram actually stores your
image on their servers in a duplicate copy as 1080x1080,
33

34
00:01:31,410 --> 00:01:34,620
assuming that it was actually submitted that way.
34

35
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:35,850
Now, what exactly does that mean?
35

36
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:36,820
Why do we care?
36

37
00:01:36,870 --> 00:01:43,020
That means that Instagram knows that it's going to eventually show them all in 1080, and so it's going to need
37

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:48,900
that 1080 version to make everything work
retroactively for all their photos.
38

39
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,880
You can tell just essentially by the code that
they know they're going to move on to it soon.
39

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,660
So by doing this, you're essentially
future-proofing your work.
40

41
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:57,410
You're welcome, future you.
41

42
00:01:57,420 --> 00:01:58,060
You're welcome, future you.
42

43
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:59,650
OK, so that's out of the way.
43

44
00:01:59,650 --> 00:02:00,450
Now, seriously.
44

45
00:02:00,450 --> 00:02:04,200
Remember that, even burn it on yourself as a tattoo.
45

46
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:10,500
Put 1080 inside of a sweet flaming skull, for all I care,
as long as you remember it. Now, does it necessarily
46

47
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:11,580
have to be a square?
47

48
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,180
Actually, no, it's just that squares are reportedly the best to use.
48

49
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:20,900
Whether people just like them more or they're just
nostalgic for the old Instagram, I don't really know,
49

50
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:22,640
Whether people just like them more or they're just
nostalgic for the old Instagram, I don't really know,
50

51
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:26,820
but you can post in two other sizes,
which are called landscape and portrait.
51

52
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:33,120
Now, sometimes, and you might have seen this, you'll
be looking at a photo and it'll be this weird rectangle.
52

53
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,120
It's not super common, but you do see it.
53

54
00:02:36,120 --> 00:02:38,000
Instagram finally allows that now.
54

55
00:02:38,010 --> 00:02:40,600
Now, landscapes, you'll want to make it in 1200x673.
55

56
00:02:40,650 --> 00:02:43,510
Now, landscapes, you'll want to make it in 1200x673.
56

57
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:45,250
Now, landscapes, you'll want to make it in 1200x673.
57

58
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:49,630
Yes, I realize 673 is incredibly random,
but that's just how math-ing works.
58

59
00:02:49,710 --> 00:02:55,440
Or, if you're a British person, how the maths work.
Once Instagram gets a hold of your 1200x673
59

60
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,420
image, they'll shrink it down to 600x336.
60

61
00:03:00,450 --> 00:03:04,330
OK, whatever, they store the big one,
and they're going to show the small one.
61

62
00:03:04,410 --> 00:03:09,750
The last size worth knowing, or at least paying attention to, is the portrait size, and that's supposed to be done in 1080x1350.
62

63
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:12,490
The last size worth knowing, or at least paying attention to, is the portrait size, and that's supposed to be done in 1080x1350.
63

64
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:21,640
Now, it'll store it at that size, but it
will scale it down to 481x599.484.
64

65
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:22,430
Yes.
65

66
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:23,910
So not really important.
66

67
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,460
Just understand that it's different. Portrait is designed
to fit with the new portrait shots that have
67

68
00:03:29,460 --> 00:03:33,160
been added to iOS and some Android compatible phones.
68

69
00:03:33,180 --> 00:03:37,490
If you already knew about that, and that happened
like three years ago, I'm sorry, you from the future,
69

70
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:41,220
but that's just the problem with making these courses.
70

71
00:03:41,220 --> 00:03:43,280
So when should we use each type,
71

72
00:03:43,290 --> 00:03:44,960
and is this something I have to memorize?
72

73
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:48,820
Well, first of all, no, you don't have to
memorize it, but 1080x1080 is pretty helpful.
73

74
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,560
We actually have the numbers attached as
a cheat sheet in the resources of this lecture,
74

75
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,070
so you can always just keep that.
75

76
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:54,710
So check it.
76

77
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:56,370
Now, when should you use these though?
77

78
00:03:56,370 --> 00:03:58,830
Honestly, I don't actually think it really matters.
78

79
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:03,380
It's not really as if your engagement is going
to be lower if you don't use all three.
79

80
00:04:03,390 --> 00:04:08,880
The only time I think it matters is if you have a great shot
and you just can't fit it into a box and get the same effect.
80

81
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:10,150
The only time I think it matters is if you have a great shot
and you just can't fit it into a box and get the same effect.
81

82
00:04:10,170 --> 00:04:12,880
Now, in that case, you've got two other options.
82

83
00:04:12,930 --> 00:04:18,900
Also, keep in mind, guys, we're going to use tools to
make these images, and most auto resize them for you,
83

84
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:21,030
so don't really freak out, it's pretty easy.
84

85
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,690
All right, guys, that's pretty much everything you
wanted to know about resolutions, and then some.
85

86
00:04:23,730 --> 00:04:24,580
All right, guys, that's pretty much everything you
wanted to know about resolutions, and then some.
86

87
00:04:24,660 --> 00:04:25,230
Moving on.
