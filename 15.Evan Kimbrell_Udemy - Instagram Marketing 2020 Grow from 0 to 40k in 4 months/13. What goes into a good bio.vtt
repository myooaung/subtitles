00:00:00.430 --> 00:00:01.830
Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.830 --> 00:00:04.340
All right, we're almost done rounding out our profile,
2

3
00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:12.760
but before we do, we have to finish up with
our bio and then with our CTA or call to action.
3

4
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.900
Now, "What is the bio?", you might ask.
4

5
00:00:14.940 --> 00:00:19.170
Well, it's the plain text that you see below your account
name on your profile page, can't really miss it.
5

6
00:00:19.170 --> 00:00:20.730
Well, it's the plain text that you see below your account
name on your profile page, can't really miss it.
6

7
00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:27.930
Now, what I'm calling the bio is centrally the lines
between your account name and your call to action,
7

8
00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.050
which we'll get into in a lecture or two, but your call
to action is always like the last two lines in your bio.
8

9
00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:35.960
which we'll get into in a lecture or two, but your call
to action is always like the last two lines in your bio.
9

10
00:00:35.970 --> 00:00:39.850
Now, technically, you enter your
call to action in your bio field,
10

11
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:45.000
but again, I'm just going to address them separately,
because they are two different parts of your account,
11

12
00:00:45.210 --> 00:00:47.250
two different strategies.
12

13
00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:49.810
So what is the game plan with your bio?
13

14
00:00:49.830 --> 00:00:51.210
Well, like anything,
14

15
00:00:51.330 --> 00:00:56.640
first take a second to bounce around some of your
favorite pages and see what other people do to get ideas.
15

16
00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:57.580
first take a second to bounce around some of your
favorite pages and see what other people do to get ideas.
16

17
00:00:57.630 --> 00:01:01.610
Once you're done with that, then let's settle
on one of two different strategies.
17

18
00:01:01.680 --> 00:01:03.690
Now, these are two strategies
18

19
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:09.910
I've personally seen work, and I wouldn't really consider
your page optimized unless you did one of them.
19

20
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:13.420
You will see plenty of people
out there that don't do either,
20

21
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:15.590
but again, I wouldn't call them optimized.
21

22
00:01:15.690 --> 00:01:22.020
So here it is. You should either do - what
I call, at least - a 1-2 bio, or do a list bio.
22

23
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.870
Now, a 1-2 bio is when you have two
sentences with really nothing fancy in them.
23

24
00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:30.900
Generally, it's just like simple, punchy, sentences.
24

25
00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:32.440
Now, why would you do it this way?
25

26
00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.160
Well, Instagram's going to limit you to 150 characters,
26

27
00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:35.880
Well, Instagram's going to limit you to 150 characters,
27

28
00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:42.870
so having a thick two liner can actually look pretty
aesthetic and also works for attention spans, because
28

29
00:01:42.870 --> 00:01:43.830
you read it, it's one sentence, two sentences,
it's not a paragraph, and you kind of move on.
29

30
00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.410
you read it, it's one sentence, two sentences,
it's not a paragraph, and you kind of move on.
30

31
00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:47.980
you read it, it's one sentence, two sentences,
it's not a paragraph, and you kind of move on.
31

32
00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:49.400
People generally like that.
32

33
00:01:49.620 --> 00:01:54.660
It's also great because you can make it one, the first
sentence, what you are, and then the second
33

34
00:01:54.660 --> 00:01:59.340
sentence is why you matter or what
you're going to deliver in the account.
34

35
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:03.090
So here's an example of a two liner, this is Kettle & Fire.
35

36
00:02:03.120 --> 00:02:05.210
We'll reference this account occasionally,
36

37
00:02:05.280 --> 00:02:11.180
because I'm completely biased and this is the company
of my co-instructor in the Growth Marketer course.
37

38
00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.890
But anyway, he does a good job with his Instagram account.
38

39
00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:16.370
Now, the other style is what we call a list bio,
39

40
00:02:16.380 --> 00:02:19.870
and that's where you see bulleted or just plain lists.
40

41
00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:26.700
The idea here is that you can package like
2-4 things to hit the reader with, and putting
41

42
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:33.080
them in a checklist style like that is a great way to get it read and get it understood. Visually, it's also something that stands out.
42

43
00:02:33.090 --> 00:02:35.030
them in a checklist style like that is a great way to get it read and get it understood. Visually, it's also something that stands out.
43

44
00:02:35.040 --> 00:02:37.220
So let's look at an account, another one we'll
see quite often, it's called Millionaire Mentor.
44

45
00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:39.970
So let's look at an account, another one we'll
see quite often, it's called Millionaire Mentor.
45

46
00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:43.930
Here you can see that there's two bullet
points and they've separated them by a line.
46

47
00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:49.290
Now, that effectively extends the bio down and
then makes it more prominent on the page.
47

48
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:55.710
Now, one thing you need to understand about bios
and users on Instagram is that in general it's that,
48

49
00:02:55.710 --> 00:03:03.120
if we were going to, say, look at Instagram users' eyes
as they land on a profile page, in marketing you
49

50
00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:08.220
call this like a heat map, where they
look would look kind of like this.
50

51
00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:10.980
First, they'd look at your profile photo,
51

52
00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.150
then they'd look at your account name,
52

53
00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:19.330
then they'd skip to the bottom of your bio to look at
your link, and then they'd quickly scan your images.
53

54
00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:24.160
Now, without fail, that's almost
always how they look at your page.
54

55
00:03:24.240 --> 00:03:31.080
If you go with a 1-2 bio, then you're essentially saying,
"Hey, that's fine to skip over this information
55

56
00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:32.880
and just go straight to my photos."
56

57
00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:36.940
Now, in that case, it emphasizes other parts
of your profile, and that's perfectly fine.
57

58
00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:40.620
Honestly, it's up to you how you
want users to interact with your page.
58

59
00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:42.430
Some people just want to focus on their photos, because
that's the best thing and their bio is not extremely interesting.
59

60
00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.790
Some people just want to focus on their photos, because
that's the best thing and their bio is not extremely interesting.
60

61
00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.020
Some people just want to focus on their photos, because
that's the best thing and their bio is not extremely interesting.
61

62
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:50.670
This will happen with a lot of business accounts
especially. List bios, on the other hand, push the photos
62

63
00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:55.890
down on old phones and then force you to at least glance at the bio, because you kind of to swipe down to see the full photo.
63

64
00:03:55.890 --> 00:03:57.380
down on old phones and then force you to at least glance at the bio, because you kind of to swipe down to see the full photo.
64

65
00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.450
Now, so, are these the only ways
you could template your bio?
65

66
00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.400
God, no.
66

67
00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:05.880
There are plenty of other ways you can do this, and
it's just that these are the two that seem to work
67

68
00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:09.570
the best and actually have data to back them up.
68

69
00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:14.590
One of my favorite quirky styles actually
is the center aligned profile.
69

70
00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.670
No one does this.
70

71
00:04:16.770 --> 00:04:22.770
But you can, you can actually center align your text, and
it looks ridiculous, and you could totally understand
71

72
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:24.840
why virtually no one does it.
72

73
00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:29.840
Yes, it sticks out, but it's incredibly annoying and
actually it means you can display less information.
73

74
00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.390
Everything else is left aligned.
74

75
00:04:31.410 --> 00:04:38.650
Now, if you're thinking, "Wow, all this talk about two
sentences on your profile page," you're not wrong.
75

76
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:46.170
Instagram is just weird in that they give you virtually
no control over your pages, so tiny little differences
76

77
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:50.510
like that actually end up being the
differentiating factor in your accounts.
77

78
00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.820
Now, with Twitter, you know, for instance, you can put a
giant cover photo or whatever you want, it's a huge photo.
78

79
00:04:55.860 --> 00:04:57.230
Lots of things in it.
79

80
00:04:57.270 --> 00:05:03.690
Instagram, on the other hand, no, you literally just
get a couple lines and they have to be plain text.
80

81
00:05:03.750 --> 00:05:09.270
Now, that leads me to one pro tip that I can say is
quite useful, and that is emojis are not just for kids,
81

82
00:05:09.270 --> 00:05:09.860
Now, that leads me to one pro tip that I can say is
quite useful, and that is emojis are not just for kids,
82

83
00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:11.470
they're also for brands.
83

84
00:05:11.520 --> 00:05:17.310
Now, it might be annoying when someone texts you four emojis in a row in a sentence or just substitutes emojis for the words.
84

85
00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.570
Now, it might be annoying when someone texts you four emojis in a row in a sentence or just substitutes emojis for the words.
85

86
00:05:19.790 --> 00:05:24.180
Personally, it makes me wonder about what we've done to the youngest generation and how we turned them into monsters.
86

87
00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.130
Personally, it makes me wonder about what we've done to the youngest generation and how we turned them into monsters.
87

88
00:05:25.170 --> 00:05:31.900
But in Instagram, because you are so restricted in
expression, they can actually make a big difference.
88

89
00:05:32.010 --> 00:05:37.380
Now, you'll notice with some of the biggest accounts, they
all use emojis, regardless of how serious the account is.
89

90
00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:38.220
Now, you'll notice with some of the biggest accounts, they
all use emojis, regardless of how serious the account is.
90

91
00:05:38.220 --> 00:05:39.170
And why is that?
91

92
00:05:39.180 --> 00:05:45.540
Well, because, number one, it gives your profile some
color and some life, and that makes it stand out.
92

93
00:05:45.540 --> 00:05:48.340
Remember, we're stuck to two sentences that's plain text.
93

94
00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:49.670
There's no color in that.
94

95
00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:57.150
Number two is that it kind of goes with the general
open and friendly and fun vibe of Instagram. Putting
95

96
00:05:57.170 --> 00:05:59.740
emojis in an academic term paper,
that's bold, also stupid.
96

97
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.680
emojis in an academic term paper,
that's bold, also stupid.
97

98
00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:02.900
Putting them on Instagram, pretty smart.
98

99
00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:03.740
Putting them on Instagram, pretty smart.
99

100
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:09.060
Now, here's my take on how to use emojis effectively.
Make sure that you're following the Goldilocks
100

101
00:06:09.060 --> 00:06:13.270
rule, and that's not too many and
not too few. If you have too few,
101

102
00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:20.370
it kind of looks like mid-sentence you rediscovered
what they were, and if you have too many, that makes
102

103
00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:22.590
you just look like a Japanese teenager.
103

104
00:06:22.590 --> 00:06:27.110
Let's look at Gary Vee, Gary Vaynerchuk,
and you can see his account.
104

105
00:06:27.270 --> 00:06:28.760
Now, look at how he does emojis.
105

106
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:33.140
He just does one per line and
each has a different dominant color.
106

107
00:06:33.150 --> 00:06:40.440
Now, not sure what an orb has to do with investing, but he's given each line some character by putting some color in there.
107

108
00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:41.460
Now, not sure what an orb has to do with investing, but he's given each line some character by putting some color in there.
108

109
00:06:41.460 --> 00:06:47.510
This guy's entire job is just to yell at people and,
look at how friendly he looks with his emojis.
109

110
00:06:47.520 --> 00:06:48.420
There you go.
110

111
00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:51.040
Also, nice list bio, bro.
111

112
00:06:51.090 --> 00:06:59.040
So that's it for the syntax and the what is what.
Go with either a 1-2 style or a list bio style, and
112

113
00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:03.340
we'll cover in the next lecture how
you actually do that in Instagram.
113

114
00:07:03.390 --> 00:07:06.010
There's a right way and kind of a wrong way.
114

115
00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:07.980
Use emojis in moderation.
115

116
00:07:08.010 --> 00:07:13.100
They really spice up your profile and give
color to an otherwise colorless block of blah.
116

117
00:07:13.170 --> 00:07:13.820
If you want, and this works pretty well, is to use your
emojis like they're reactions to each sentence.
117

118
00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:19.380
If you want, and this works pretty well, is to use your
emojis like they're reactions to each sentence.
118

119
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:26.180
You know, "millionaire at 16," and you put like the wow face,
"living in my favorite location," then you put the palm tree,
119

120
00:07:26.180 --> 00:07:28.060
You know, "millionaire at 16," and you put like the wow face,
"living in my favorite location," then you put the palm tree,
120

121
00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:33.540
"message me for business," and then, you know,
you can put like a bag of dollars because it implies
121

122
00:07:33.540 --> 00:07:34.990
corruption and that you can be bought.
122

123
00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.690
Alright, guys. Next up, since we've covered how to
talk in your bio, let's go over what you should say.
123

124
00:07:40.830 --> 00:07:41.240
See you then.
