1
00:00:00,210 --> 00:00:01,450
You guys will come back.

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:08,540
OK so I'm going to give you an update on where we're at as of September for something like that.

3
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:11,730
OK so we finally hit 25000.

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:17,850
I apologize for not doing more updates since the last one the last time I checked in or something like

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:19,230
14000.

6
00:00:19,230 --> 00:00:24,090
So a lot's changed in terms of followers since then but the reason it really check in is just because

7
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:25,300
I haven't done anything.

8
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:27,930
Honestly I really have not been touching this at all.

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:32,430
Only thing I've been doing on my regular routines of getting on and commenting on other people's photos

10
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:38,510
and then responding to all of my comments the content team pretty much takes care of the rest of it.

11
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:43,130
So that means I haven't even done any of the giveaways of the lives yet.

12
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:44,810
Yes I now I really should do this.

13
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:48,620
I just keep convincing myself is a better time to do it.

14
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,690
Maybe I'll do that in the next video or something like that.

15
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:54,120
But so what.

16
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,650
The only thing that has really changed I think since the last time we posted and I think we talked about

17
00:00:58,650 --> 00:01:05,100
it in the last one was that we're going to try a more unmodulated version of the best hits.

18
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,410
So I talked with us in the course also in the fall of Long's where one strategy is to take your best

19
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:15,010
posts and then consistently repost them and delete them.

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:17,180
A lot of accounts do that.

21
00:01:17,180 --> 00:01:22,170
And so we kind of tried this hybrid version where we were posting what we thought were the best posts

22
00:01:22,770 --> 00:01:28,760
mixed in with some of the new ones because we were still producing new posts and then we kind of had

23
00:01:28,760 --> 00:01:33,900
to like a 21 day cycle something like that so after 21 days we go back and delete all of the ones that

24
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,660
were repo's leaving the new ones there.

25
00:01:36,660 --> 00:01:38,740
And then we kind of like start over again.

26
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:40,960
So that kind of worked.

27
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:47,020
The thing that really made a big difference and I'll show you there is a big change in our growth.

28
00:01:47,430 --> 00:01:49,370
Unfortunately I kind of square.

29
00:01:49,380 --> 00:01:52,110
Has this problem where it keeps disconnecting and reconnecting.

30
00:01:52,140 --> 00:01:56,690
So what will happen is it will look like I have no followers for four days and there are a ton of followers

31
00:01:56,690 --> 00:02:01,800
in one day and that's just because it disconnected for some reason and I didn't get to it in time or

32
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,240
I thought I did but it didn't.

33
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:07,190
So let's look at the last.

34
00:02:07,440 --> 00:02:09,300
I don't know let's see where we're at.

35
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:10,110
OK.

36
00:02:10,120 --> 00:02:11,150
So yeah.

37
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:14,170
So these ones are all screwed up when you lose 123 followers.

38
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,490
That's just an issue with iconic square.

39
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,030
I also didn't gain 625 in a day or 487.

40
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:28,170
It was just trying to catch up I think does a really bad job of like really configuring its calculation

41
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:29,610
once it does get reconnected.

42
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:34,530
I honestly don't know how this works but you can kind of see here that we had a really consistent clip

43
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:43,260
of 300 400 300 200 300 400 300 etc days and it kind of started around.

44
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:46,080
See this was a shout out.

45
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:51,720
We actually got some free thank God around Yeah about three weeks ago.

46
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:57,470
So that was kind of the start of our current round of best best hits posting.

47
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:03,690
So we're 175 that's fine 200 200 but you notice it just starts to stretch up and then we start really

48
00:03:03,690 --> 00:03:07,000
kind of hitting consistently in the three hundreds potentially of 400.

49
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:09,140
So that was a big factor in our growth.

50
00:03:09,140 --> 00:03:13,250
I mean it's big when you add a thousand every three days whereas before you're out a thousand every

51
00:03:13,260 --> 00:03:14,340
like eight days.

52
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:20,220
And that's really just because we had change up our posting strategy a little bit of the tweak that

53
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:20,720
we had made.

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:27,460
So originally we were just looking for posts that from the I had higher engagement because I chorus

55
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:31,910
girls are your best posts but it won't show you all of them based on engagement.

56
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:37,770
So we are trying our best to just say OK well we think this one is popular this one is popular and we

57
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:41,170
are posting like that it didn't really make a big difference.

58
00:03:41,190 --> 00:03:48,600
So what we did was instead used in Seagram's own analytics to tell us what was getting us more exposure

59
00:03:48,620 --> 00:03:49,650
because that's the biggest thing.

60
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:53,210
I mean it doesn't matter if we keep sending our selfies same people it's going to grow or count.

61
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:59,070
So we would find accounts like this where you get viewer insights and to the eye it doesn't really look

62
00:03:59,070 --> 00:04:01,570
like it's that different.

63
00:04:01,620 --> 00:04:04,950
It only has seven comments that's not a ton although we don't have a ton of comments on our account

64
00:04:04,950 --> 00:04:05,870
right now.

65
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:08,760
U.N. site says 19 profiles is at 6000 reach.

66
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,910
OK that's kind of the first hint that it had more but this is the big one.

67
00:04:11,910 --> 00:04:13,980
It just says 21 percent weren't following you.

68
00:04:13,980 --> 00:04:16,980
Now that's not remarkable.

69
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:22,940
I mean if you remember the very beginning of the course before Instagram's apocalyptic update we could

70
00:04:22,940 --> 00:04:27,240
get 60 percent new people every single time we posted.

71
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:33,500
But now a post that doesn't do well you might get 1 percent to 5 percent.

72
00:04:33,570 --> 00:04:38,600
So we just started looking for these as if it was anything over like 15 percent or 10 percent.

73
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,370
Then we know it was something that was worth to be posting and so we really just focused on those.

74
00:04:43,410 --> 00:04:45,520
See if we can find an unpopular one.

75
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:56,460
Let's see that one was doing better I guess these are all kind of our best ofs So let's see.

76
00:04:57,270 --> 00:05:06,070
It's battery because that's a 10 percent it's a little bit lower we might have ignored that one.

77
00:05:06,510 --> 00:05:06,860
Let's see.

78
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,220
I remember that one did well.

79
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,640
OK so let's take one of the older ones that just was not good.

80
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:17,920
And so like this one there was a health and well-being app hopes of boosting happiness great.

81
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:22,670
So if you look at the viewing insights one profile visit only 5 percent weren't following us.

82
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,610
So that was the real indicator that kind of helped us figure out what's going to work because engagement

83
00:05:29,610 --> 00:05:31,860
right doesn't necessarily mean anything.

84
00:05:31,920 --> 00:05:37,160
You know if you're using friends it's like a like exchange or using a follow BOD or doing a lot of things

85
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:44,890
at once you don't really know if it's the content that's doing well or if instagram likes it or what.

86
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:46,200
But we were able to figure out.

87
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,690
So let's see this one.

88
00:05:47,700 --> 00:05:48,450
Nine percent.

89
00:05:48,460 --> 00:05:49,850
OK so that's still pretty low.

90
00:05:49,860 --> 00:05:52,470
Right like is it a threshold we're looking for was over 10 percent.

91
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:55,040
See this one.

92
00:05:55,110 --> 00:05:56,090
Seven percent.

93
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:58,500
Yeah I mean these are pretty low.

94
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:05,100
So we just kind of focused on ones that were just anything over 10 percent.

95
00:06:05,250 --> 00:06:10,600
And so you would get a lot of like see like this one yeah.

96
00:06:10,610 --> 00:06:12,720
I mean 28 percent are following you.

97
00:06:12,710 --> 00:06:14,870
Look this is an incredible one.

98
00:06:14,930 --> 00:06:20,810
This was a carousel kind of like a weekly Delio but because it was the best of the best sets it did

99
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:21,690
really well.

100
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:24,540
So that was the biggest modification we made.

101
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,670
That was largely responsible for the uptick in growth.

102
00:06:28,790 --> 00:06:32,690
And now you'll notice we're actually posting from the very beginning because we've essentially run out

103
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:33,290
of content.

104
00:06:33,290 --> 00:06:38,960
We're not producing it as fast as I'm posting but it's zero 674 Post currently.

105
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:39,770
These are not all unique.

106
00:06:39,770 --> 00:06:44,760
By the way that means that I can start posting from the very beginning and there's no way that someone

107
00:06:44,760 --> 00:06:46,390
would remember that we posted this one.

108
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:49,850
This is one of the very first ones we ever posted.

109
00:06:50,330 --> 00:06:55,850
And it was way back when I think it was one of the third or fourth ones we ever posted.

110
00:06:55,850 --> 00:07:00,330
So no one's going to remember that and if they do we're kind of scanning the Commons just to make sure.

111
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:07,550
So that was the biggest change and besides that we still have to follow OBOT working on Jervy.

112
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:14,960
So that brings in who knows 50 to 100 maybe a day maybe 50 to 80 something like that me liking stuff

113
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,490
and commenting and people tagging that's a big one but I think the biggest thing is just figuring out

114
00:07:19,490 --> 00:07:20,420
what Instagram likes.

115
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:26,600
Now whether or not this is a sustainable strategy I don't really know because best hits means it's the

116
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:31,760
best and if I have let's say 500 unique posts and rolling to post the top 20 percent and even that's

117
00:07:31,760 --> 00:07:34,560
kind of pushing it that's only 100 posts.

118
00:07:34,580 --> 00:07:36,860
So why would run out pretty quickly.

119
00:07:36,860 --> 00:07:39,980
I mean I think I did make that last for twenty days.

120
00:07:40,460 --> 00:07:47,270
Ideally what we are going to try to do is we're going to try to slip in New ones as we go just to test

121
00:07:47,270 --> 00:07:53,210
to see if we have more goodies and we'll keep reposting the ones that were really good with.

122
00:07:53,210 --> 00:08:00,200
The ideal range of about a month I think because I think if we post for a month the best hits and then

123
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,450
rehash them and start posting them again the next month and that's enough time that people aren't really

124
00:08:05,450 --> 00:08:06,520
going to notice anyway.

125
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:08,490
It's just a battle of stretching your content.

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:11,390
OK so next check on all show you what's changed.

127
00:08:11,600 --> 00:08:15,880
I'll tell you if we tried new strategies or hey if I did nothing.

128
00:08:15,890 --> 00:08:20,410
I mean I really did not do much on this one in the last like three weeks.

129
00:08:20,420 --> 00:08:21,790
That's kind of the beauty of this system.

130
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:25,740
I have not touched this and we've gained almost 10000 followers so.

131
00:08:25,760 --> 00:08:27,790
All right so pretty sweet we see in the next lecture.
