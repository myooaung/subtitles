00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:06,690
You guys welcome back this lecture we're going to do is just go over what the Instagram live user interface

2
00:00:06,690 --> 00:00:07,400
looks like.

3
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:11,640
How do you start from one and what settings you have to control it.

4
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,310
So it's pretty simple.

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:16,480
It runs very similar to stories like it runs just out of your camera.

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,880
So just go to your home screen and then you can put the camera on the top left and all you have to do

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:25,810
now at the very bottom is go to live.

8
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:26,980
That's it.

9
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:28,480
It's just a camera setting.

10
00:00:28,530 --> 00:00:33,690
Typically once you're on the screen then it's a question of getting set up making sure you have everything

11
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:34,740
ready to go.

12
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:40,440
And then actually jumping and it gives you some previews right here so you know you can flip your camera

13
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,180
around right before you go live.

14
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,510
You can also add these facial things very similar to snap chat filters that change your face to make

15
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:49,830
you look ridiculous.

16
00:00:49,830 --> 00:00:51,930
That's kind of nice of you just doing an impromptu thing.

17
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:54,550
Now up here in the top left we have settings.

18
00:00:54,570 --> 00:00:57,250
Now what you can do is similar to stories.

19
00:00:57,270 --> 00:01:02,640
You can actually hide your life from certain people and all you kind of have to do is just go to hide

20
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:03,770
story from.

21
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:06,260
And it works very much the same way.

22
00:01:06,270 --> 00:01:12,180
So if you had someone who was really obnoxious and and past experiences just lower the quality of whatever

23
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:15,660
it is that you're doing live you could block them if you wanted to.

24
00:01:15,660 --> 00:01:20,250
Or perhaps you work with other Instr recounts as advertisers so maybe you don't want to see exactly

25
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:20,980
what you're doing.

26
00:01:21,060 --> 00:01:27,180
Other than that I definitely like to say save the camera roll just so you have a backup of whatever

27
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:33,450
you do allow message replies it's pretty much up to you and the rest it's pretty simple if you want

28
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:35,700
to do cross share to Facebook you could do that.

29
00:01:35,700 --> 00:01:37,420
It's all pretty straightforward.

30
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:37,830
OK.

31
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:39,580
I mean that's pretty much it.

32
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,070
I'll jump into the dummy account just so you can kind of see what it looks like once you start one.

33
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:50,190
But you also see how we run one with innovation station and it'll be a bit of a learning experience

34
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:50,370
too.

35
00:01:50,370 --> 00:01:52,530
This is the first time we'll be doing it for that account.

36
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:54,190
So now here for it.

37
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:54,950
Let's see.

38
00:01:54,970 --> 00:01:57,050
So innovative or dummy account.

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,000
And we wanted to run a live.

40
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:04,840
You just go live and then you start video checks your connection.

41
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:06,030
You're now live.

42
00:02:06,040 --> 00:02:06,530
Right.

43
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:06,990
OK.

44
00:02:07,020 --> 00:02:09,550
So yep pretty much.

45
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:09,850
It.

46
00:02:09,970 --> 00:02:14,220
It gives you options for like for instance bringing someone into your chat right here.

47
00:02:14,220 --> 00:02:19,320
So if you have someone in your chat watching it you can actually bring their video in as well so it's

48
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:22,300
a pretty easy way to turn this into a conversation directly.

49
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:25,650
Here's a way to send it directly to people to get their attention.

50
00:02:25,650 --> 00:02:28,400
So let's say you wanted to do a joint life together.

51
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:33,740
You could then hit that share button that Senate directly to them as soon as you go live.

52
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:37,200
Here's that same button if you want to make your face look ridiculous.

53
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:39,670
So yeah for the most part that's pretty much it.

54
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:41,550
You have comments right here.

55
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,350
And if you want to turn them off any point you set turn off commenting and then turn off requests to

56
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:46,770
go live.

57
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:49,980
So that's basically when people will request to join in on your video.

58
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,490
Now it's up to you and what your content strategy is if that's something you want to do.

59
00:02:53,670 --> 00:02:55,110
So when you're done you know.

60
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,370
And and it will say in my video you confirm it and then appear on the top right.

61
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:00,540
You can save it.

62
00:03:00,540 --> 00:03:06,880
And if you want to keep it public for 24 hours you can leave that tract.

63
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,150
And you know I don't know.

64
00:03:09,270 --> 00:03:12,580
I'm not even sure exactly where that will display.

65
00:03:12,780 --> 00:03:14,390
But could it share.

66
00:03:14,820 --> 00:03:17,570
OK so it ends up just adding it to your story.

67
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:17,820
Right.

68
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:23,400
So now hold onto my story and click that it'll basically show what happened.

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:27,710
It'll show me staring at my keyboard talking for 24 hours.

70
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:30,570
So not exactly fascinating but that's pretty much it.

71
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:33,600
I mean there's nothing really else to this.

72
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,070
It's pretty straightforward.

73
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:39,380
It's really up to you to design your content and to figure out what exactly are going to do.

74
00:03:39,380 --> 00:03:44,760
You know do a Q&amp;A do unity tutorial interview someone you can totally do that on live just pointed at

75
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:49,390
both of you or pointed at one of them and take turns alternating back and forth.

76
00:03:49,390 --> 00:03:56,290
Don't make it a Q&amp;A do you want to make it on those ones where you have fans come in and ask you questions.

77
00:03:56,310 --> 00:04:00,820
It's like multiple people talking at once it can kind of look like a chat room really up to you.

78
00:04:00,900 --> 00:04:01,410
OK.

79
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,990
Next you're going to do is I'm going to show you just some quick and easy ways to promote the live event

80
00:04:07,020 --> 00:04:09,860
that you're going to do to a post and a story.

81
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:11,100
So it really simple.

82
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:15,800
Then after that we'll do a actual live run with innovation station.

83
00:04:15,820 --> 00:04:16,300
See.
