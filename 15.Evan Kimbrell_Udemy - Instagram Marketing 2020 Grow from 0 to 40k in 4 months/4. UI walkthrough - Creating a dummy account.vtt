Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:07.110
OK, so in this lecture we're going to go over really
quickly how to sign up in Instagram, and this is for
2

3
00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:10.470
people who have never used the app before.
3

4
00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:14.970
We're also going to cover in the same process how to
create your first dummy account. What's a dummy
4

5
00:00:14.970 --> 00:00:22.050
account? Just an account that we can use as kind of a
sandbox to play around in Instagram and not have anything
5

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:24.150
we do become permanent.
6

7
00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.820
The idea is later on in the course you'll have one
permanent publishing account and then one you kind
7

8
00:00:29.820 --> 00:00:34.800
of screw around with, it's really helpful to get used to the
user interface through the dummy account to try posting,
8

9
00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.100
of screw around with, it's really helpful to get used to the
user interface through the dummy account to try posting,
9

10
00:00:36.100 --> 00:00:41.610
try commenting, try following, trying out different types
of content, different types of posts to see what
10

11
00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.820
works, and then you can transfer
it to your more official account.
11

12
00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:51.990
Like I was saying before, if you have any experience
with Instagram, please skip this lecture, I don't
12

13
00:00:51.990 --> 00:00:54.380
want to hear about it in the comments. Otherwise,
13

14
00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:58.110
all right, let's just go through the process and I'll kind
of walk you through it with little tips as we go along.
14

15
00:00:58.110 --> 00:00:58.960
all right, let's just go through the process and I'll kind
of walk you through it with little tips as we go along.
15

16
00:00:58.980 --> 00:01:00.380
We'll do it in iOS and Android at the same
time, they're virtually the same thing,
16

17
00:01:00.600 --> 00:01:03.720
We'll do it in iOS and Android at the same
time, they're virtually the same thing,
17

18
00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:06.490
so you're not really missing anything.
18

19
00:01:06.540 --> 00:01:12.750
Okay, first things first, make sure that you download
the Instagram application, as I've done on both phones.
19

20
00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:15.360
Just go ahead and open it and start the process.
20

21
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:21.610
So, you notice they are basically the
same thing. In Instagram on iOS,
21

22
00:01:22.050 --> 00:01:23.910
it's just the colors are a little bit different.
22

23
00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:26.100
Then on Android, no biggie.
23

24
00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:30.520
So what you want to do is it'll ask you to sign in or
continue with your Facebook, doesn't really matter.
24

25
00:01:30.540 --> 00:01:33.170
I'm going to hit sign up at the bottom for each one.
25

26
00:01:33.170 --> 00:01:35.320
So I don't have an account, sign up.
26

27
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:39.840
Then what it does is it asks you if you want to
create your account basically through Facebook, or
27

28
00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:41.510
if you want to do email or phone.
28

29
00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:47.490
My preference for you guys is to do either email or phone,
specifically e-mail. Now, the reason why we do that is
29

30
00:01:47.520 --> 00:01:51.200
because we're going to create a lot of accounts later on,
30

31
00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:56.240
and what's going to happen is it's going to be
really hard to do that with one phone number,
31

32
00:01:56.250 --> 00:02:00.150
and it's also going to be really hard to do that with one Facebook.
You can attach your Facebook later on to your official account,
32

33
00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:01.150
and it's also going to be really hard to do that with one Facebook.
You can attach your Facebook later on to your official account,
33

34
00:02:01.160 --> 00:02:06.990
but you'll have a lot more flexibility if you just use
e-mails, because we can create multiple e-mails, so
34

35
00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:14.920
just do that. Then go here and just click through to
email, put in whatever e-mail you want for this one,
35

36
00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.870
you know, it's the dummy, so we don't really care about it.
36

37
00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.750
OK, once you get your e-mail, then you're good.
37

38
00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.350
Just move along.
38

39
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.000
OK.
39

40
00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:28.460
Then the next section... On Android,
they don't ask you for a profile photo yet.
40

41
00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:30.410
Then the next section... On Android,
they don't ask you for a profile photo yet.
41

42
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:33.640
On iOS, they do, for whatever reason. Doesn't really, I don't know.
42

43
00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:34.650
On iOS, they do, for whatever reason. Doesn't really, I don't know.
43

44
00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.340
So it'll ask you for your full name,
44

45
00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:41.720
and usually that's because Instagram accounts are
made for people, but for you, you can be a business,
45

46
00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:44.390
or a themed account, or a person,
doesn't really matter. For this,
46

47
00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:45.560
it doesn't matter at all.
47

48
00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:49.760
One thing you need to understand is that anything we enter in right now is not permanent and it's not going to matter later on.
48

49
00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:51.110
One thing you need to understand is that anything we enter in right now is not permanent and it's not going to matter later on.
49

50
00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:55.520
You can change it, you can change your username, you
can change your account name, you can change your
50

51
00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:01.640
photo, you can change pretty much anything, so you
can just put in just gibberish right now if you want to.
51

52
00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:02.440
photo, you can change pretty much anything, so you
can just put in just gibberish right now if you want to.
52

53
00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:06.980
So I'll just put Innovation On Demand,
53

54
00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:15.960
I don't know what that means, same thing over
here, I'll say Innovation Today. My accounts,
54

55
00:03:15.970 --> 00:03:20.660
you'll see in the follow along, are
going to be around innovation,
55

56
00:03:20.680 --> 00:03:23.920
that's going to be the theme I use. So over here on iOS,
56

57
00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.090
we have to put a photo, so just grab whatever you have.
57

58
00:03:28.090 --> 00:03:29.870
You also don't have to do it right now,
58

59
00:03:29.890 --> 00:03:31.860
you can just skip it if you want.
59

60
00:03:31.860 --> 00:03:34.780
So I'll just pick something that matches.
60

61
00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:35.300
OK.
61

62
00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.960
There we go.
62

63
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:37.180
You know, pick your password.
63

64
00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:39.420
We'll just skip over this, you don't want to see my password.
64

65
00:03:41.580 --> 00:03:43.850
Ok, then same thing.
65

66
00:03:44.070 --> 00:03:44.300
OK.
66

67
00:03:44.310 --> 00:03:48.810
So on iOS it's going to ask you to create a username,
on Android it's going to just welcome you.
67

68
00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:51.260
So on iOS it's going to ask you to create a username,
on Android it's going to just welcome you.
68

69
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:56.650
So one thing you'll notice right off the bat is that
on Android, your full name is automatically going
69

70
00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:58.500
to be made your username.
70

71
00:03:58.500 --> 00:03:59.950
Those are two different things.
71

72
00:03:59.970 --> 00:04:04.070
Again, doesn't matter, we can change
all of this later, so don't worry about it.
72

73
00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:07.680
That's just one thing worth pointing out,
because eventually you'll try to do this later.
73

74
00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.840
So on iOS, it wants us to choose a username.
74

75
00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.430
And for this we'll just pick something
random, it will be ohsoinnovative.
75

76
00:04:20.210 --> 00:04:23.770
And over here, we'll just keep the same
username, you can always change it later.
76

77
00:04:23.810 --> 00:04:30.170
OK, so hit next. All right, so once you hit connect
to Facebook, right now we don't need to do that,
77

78
00:04:30.170 --> 00:04:31.750
you guys can, if you want to.
78

79
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.410
It's not going to really help us in any way.
Then it wants us to add some contacts.
79

80
00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:36.970
On iOS, I'll say no. Same thing on Android.
80

81
00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:38.740
On iOS, I'll say no. Same thing on Android.
81

82
00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:42.230
Then it'll ask, on Android, if you want
to add a profile photo if you want to.
82

83
00:04:42.230 --> 00:04:47.810
Sure, I will, I'll add a similar photo.
83

84
00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:49.100
Should be good.
84

85
00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.770
Also should... No? OK.
85

86
00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.410
Also should... No? OK.
86

87
00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:56.840
And hit next. Great, and then Android wants to
know if you want to save your login information.
87

88
00:04:56.840 --> 00:04:57.680
Sure, why not?
88

89
00:04:57.690 --> 00:04:59.430
It's always worth doing.
89

90
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:04.730
On iOS, we can skip that, it asks us if you want to follow
more people. I generally like to give it my contacts
90

91
00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:07.030
anyway, just because later on it becomes helpful.
91

92
00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:08.400
But otherwise, here we are.
92

93
00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:09.230
OK, great.
93

94
00:05:09.230 --> 00:05:16.010
On both sides, we are at the the feed page,
which is great. If you want to go to your profile,
94

95
00:05:16.010 --> 00:05:20.190
it's always at the bottom right here,
it's this outline of a person,
95

96
00:05:20.270 --> 00:05:26.000
and if you want to change any of the information
we just set up, you just go over to Edit Profile.
96

97
00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.650
You might think that clicking on the
profile picture itself is what you should do,
97

98
00:05:30.770 --> 00:05:32.510
but that actually doesn't do anything,
98

99
00:05:32.510 --> 00:05:38.750
believe it or not, or it tries to add a story, it doesn't change
your profile picture, you actually want to go to Edit Profile.
99

100
00:05:38.750 --> 00:05:42.000
So here we can actually change everything we want, right?
100

101
00:05:42.020 --> 00:05:48.520
So the top is your account name, here's your username,
that's your bio, and everything else like that, and
101

102
00:05:48.540 --> 00:05:50.240
you can even change your e-mail address,
102

103
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.220
you can add your phone number at this point.
103

104
00:05:52.460 --> 00:05:56.810
OK, guys, we'll cover the other sections of the app later on.
104

105
00:05:56.810 --> 00:06:04.460
We'll go over the profile section, like what the
parts are, what are they called, etc. in this section,
105

106
00:06:04.490 --> 00:06:08.960
and then we'll move on and we'll look at things like
the posting section or the search and discovery section,
106

107
00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:09.780
and then we'll move on and we'll look at things like
the posting section or the search and discovery section,
107

108
00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:12.440
so we'll kind of fill it in a little bit as you go.
108

109
00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:19.050
Just keep looking for these UI walkthrough lectures
if you're completely brand new to Instagram.
109

110
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:23.870
OK, guys, make sure you have an account going
forward, because it makes it a whole lot easier.
110

111
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:28.400
And guess what? We just made our first dummy account so
you can screw around all you want on here and get used to it.
111

112
00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.410
And guess what? We just made our first dummy account so
you can screw around all you want on here and get used to it.
112

113
00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.830
OK. See you next lecture.
113

114
00:06:29.870 --> 00:06:30.530
OK. See you next lecture.
