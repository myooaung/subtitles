00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,610
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,700 --> 00:00:01,960
All right.

3
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,380
So this lecture I'm gonna make a couple image posts in Canada.

4
00:00:06,430 --> 00:00:10,590
That's my preferred way of doing it for innovation station.

5
00:00:10,740 --> 00:00:14,640
If you are interested in this watch and follow along.

6
00:00:14,640 --> 00:00:17,570
And if you're not don't I don't care.

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:22,590
You can also increase the speed of the video player if you just want to skim through it to the bottom

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:23,270
right.

9
00:00:23,280 --> 00:00:24,900
You can go all the way up to X.

10
00:00:24,990 --> 00:00:25,680
OK.

11
00:00:25,770 --> 00:00:28,000
So we are back at Kanva.

12
00:00:28,190 --> 00:00:28,600
OK.

13
00:00:28,620 --> 00:00:34,880
So what I was going to do is one make a motivational quote poster an innovation post a quote Post and

14
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,330
the other one I was going to do it had something to do with one of the innovations that I wanted to

15
00:00:39,330 --> 00:00:42,180
cover so I kind experiment with that.

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:45,270
All right so step one has always is just going to be going down.

17
00:00:45,270 --> 00:00:46,440
Instagram post.

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:50,180
Now if I wanted to I could use one of these templates.

19
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:55,040
So since it's a quote I could use that one looks pretty good.

20
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:56,370
Man this one's pretty good.

21
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,740
That's a style I think I'm actually going to imitate this for one of them.

22
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:07,830
I'm going to copy this for you the one where I show off some type of innovation so I might as well actually

23
00:01:07,830 --> 00:01:08,920
just do that one first.

24
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,600
So this is what I was thinking to take this background and swap it out with an image from a story that

25
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,910
found the story.

26
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,800
They use grapheme watches.

27
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:23,490
I don't even know some form of carbon to print things on food.

28
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,120
And you can turn the food into circuit boards.

29
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:26,970
I don't know why you would want to do that.

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,380
I think it's more like you could track food to table tracking would be interesting.

31
00:01:32,510 --> 00:01:34,100
You know a couple of their applications.

32
00:01:34,250 --> 00:01:38,240
So anyway I took this image and are just going to throw it in here.

33
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:45,260
So all I have to do is cook the background and image right here so it'll pop up right there.

34
00:01:45,330 --> 00:01:48,240
You see it at four.

35
00:01:48,300 --> 00:01:54,560
And then once it's done I can click it and it should just kind of wave it over here.

36
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:55,010
There we go.

37
00:01:55,020 --> 00:01:57,200
He took over the background.

38
00:01:57,210 --> 00:01:57,830
Cool.

39
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,360
OK.

40
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:04,590
And then this text right here is spartan saying.

41
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:12,810
And so what is probably going to do was put a sentence description of it and then I'm going to blow

42
00:02:12,810 --> 00:02:16,270
the background a little bit more and then put our branding.

43
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:18,270
So what I'll do is change it to

44
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:22,980
the

45
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,940
way and accent.

46
00:02:29,950 --> 00:02:42,690
You go to Moudry pedia and the braid Brad copyright or that in their bread.

47
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:43,640
You can read that.

48
00:02:43,650 --> 00:02:44,940
That's kind of cool.

49
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,620
And then all I want to do is put in my logo down here.

50
00:02:48,630 --> 00:02:54,260
I'm guessing maybe the outline of the logo at the top so I'll try that.

51
00:02:54,300 --> 00:03:00,340
So I have to actually pull the icon and the text out of an image from the designer.

52
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:01,490
Just take a moment.

53
00:03:10,420 --> 00:03:14,160
OK I know what done that I just have to upload images.

54
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:21,720
I did these two same time.

55
00:03:22,220 --> 00:03:24,310
And here

56
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,720
now you can use the guidelines right here to make sure that it's center aligned.

57
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:35,150
It's actually pretty helpful it's really knowing it pops up.

58
00:03:35,180 --> 00:03:41,700
But OK and then up here we'll put the actual icon to the

59
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:51,510
so that would be one way of doing it.

60
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:52,950
Well I want a center line this.

61
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:54,110
There you go.

62
00:03:54,580 --> 00:03:54,910
OK.

63
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,920
So we take a step back look at it and I'm sure.

64
00:03:58,960 --> 00:04:00,610
I love the logo being up there.

65
00:04:00,610 --> 00:04:01,930
I can put this in a corner.

66
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:04,440
I could put it on both innovation station.

67
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:08,830
So it depends how much readability is important to me.

68
00:04:09,160 --> 00:04:15,260
So I could probably shrink it make it more minor visually at least

69
00:04:18,470 --> 00:04:19,570
and then.

70
00:04:19,940 --> 00:04:21,740
Yeah I think that's fine.

71
00:04:21,740 --> 00:04:23,870
I might shrink this a little bit more.

72
00:04:26,900 --> 00:04:27,400
OK.

73
00:04:27,410 --> 00:04:34,080
And then the question is to use a font as a secondary font or use the font that's there.

74
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:43,200
Probably in this case I'll use the font if I have it that's actually being used in the logo.

75
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,100
Because it was you boom to go.

76
00:04:51,110 --> 00:04:56,370
And then I might do some resizing just to make it fit better.

77
00:04:56,370 --> 00:04:59,220
So there I go.

78
00:04:59,230 --> 00:05:01,070
So that might be one way of doing it.

79
00:05:01,140 --> 00:05:03,040
I could also mess with this.

80
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:05,720
It's not all caps.

81
00:05:05,730 --> 00:05:08,640
I wanted to and I also bowled it.

82
00:05:08,650 --> 00:05:15,260
That's another thing is that it's an old I'd also tweak the spacing.

83
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:18,850
You notice how spaced out these words are it's kind of strange.

84
00:05:19,390 --> 00:05:25,500
I can pull it back a little bit and the line height too is another one that seems a bit odd.

85
00:05:25,620 --> 00:05:27,990
You can roll that back a little bit.

86
00:05:29,090 --> 00:05:33,440
I don't know if I like having caps anyway.

87
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:34,220
OK.

88
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,240
So that's I think decent.

89
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:40,660
It's a little bit hard to read but that's about it.

90
00:05:40,670 --> 00:05:48,950
You know I might if this is the case add another filter to this so I might filter it and then make it

91
00:05:48,950 --> 00:05:56,820
low contrast So you see what's happening is it kind of fades of the background just a little bit that

92
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:00,090
can help like you can still see that it's toast.

93
00:06:00,420 --> 00:06:05,640
You just don't need to see everything down here or you can add some other stuff that we had before.

94
00:06:05,640 --> 00:06:08,010
I mean another way of doing this would be to out a blur.

95
00:06:08,220 --> 00:06:09,380
You can just blurt out.

96
00:06:09,390 --> 00:06:12,980
But personally I prefer if they can see what it is.

97
00:06:13,410 --> 00:06:16,010
I don't know what an anti border is.

98
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,280
I guess it's more like pixillated it's an interesting effect in and of itself.

99
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:22,330
But again kind of hard to read.

100
00:06:22,350 --> 00:06:32,520
So we will get rid of that weird effect that so I threw back the contrast and yet I think that's about

101
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:33,000
it.

102
00:06:33,230 --> 00:06:33,590
OK.

103
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,620
So I think that's actually pretty good.

104
00:06:36,810 --> 00:06:45,550
So what I would do is download that and now I have a post that we can post OK.

105
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,460
Let's move on to the second image so we can start another one by going back here and go do the same

106
00:06:52,460 --> 00:06:56,150
thing that we did before Instagram post just in this way it saves it.

107
00:06:56,180 --> 00:06:57,290
I mean there's other ways of doing it.

108
00:06:57,320 --> 00:06:59,220
But I'm stuck in many ways.

109
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,810
What we do now is a motivational quote.

110
00:07:01,820 --> 00:07:05,960
And so for this one actually I'm going to use the background that I had designed so I'll just upload

111
00:07:05,960 --> 00:07:15,920
it as a photo frame that on there it'll snap fit usually if I needed to crop it croppings right there

112
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:17,030
works pretty simple.

113
00:07:17,030 --> 00:07:21,030
You just hit it and then you can pick how are you going to crop it.

114
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:21,650
OK.

115
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:23,990
So that's already done for me.

116
00:07:24,020 --> 00:07:26,250
And then all I could do is throw them the quote.

117
00:07:26,270 --> 00:07:32,510
So I got a text and these already have a font I'm but this is how you do custom text you just pick one

118
00:07:32,510 --> 00:07:33,320
of these.

119
00:07:33,320 --> 00:07:38,390
So I might do that and then I went to Brini quote dot com.

120
00:07:38,390 --> 00:07:40,310
There's a million places to get quotes.

121
00:07:40,310 --> 00:07:42,410
I literally typed in innovation.

122
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:43,460
This one came up.

123
00:07:43,490 --> 00:07:45,060
I kind of like this.

124
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,390
Dean Kamen is an interesting inventor made the Segway also makes prosthetic arms.

125
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:52,930
It's near and dear to my heart.

126
00:07:52,940 --> 00:07:58,380
So put in his quote and get rid of the brainy quote thing.

127
00:07:59,810 --> 00:08:01,300
In the break.

128
00:08:01,830 --> 00:08:03,110
I don't know jack.

129
00:08:03,540 --> 00:08:07,140
And we've got to go back to beento

130
00:08:09,790 --> 00:08:19,160
let's make it want to read it.

131
00:08:19,170 --> 00:08:21,350
So a lot of this just comes down to tweaking.

132
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:28,200
To be honest like you just said a lot of time messing with the alignment messing with the font size

133
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:33,720
and just messing with like spacing it just looks right to you.

134
00:08:33,720 --> 00:08:36,000
There's no it's not much of a science to it.

135
00:08:36,030 --> 00:08:38,860
It's also kind of based on preferences.

136
00:08:38,940 --> 00:08:44,090
So generally one thing is that I wouldn't ever have contracted Why are spacing like this.

137
00:08:44,310 --> 00:08:45,230
It's just hard to read.

138
00:08:45,390 --> 00:08:56,530
So I hate sharing that a little bit and I think that's pretty easy to read but you should probably make

139
00:08:56,530 --> 00:08:57,470
it larger.

140
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:06,480
Boy bullshit like the other one did you get size and just keep kind of tweaking it till we get where

141
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:07,270
we want to go.

142
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:08,990
OK so that looks fine.

143
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:12,930
I don't like the way this one little thing at the end is kind of a hanger on.

144
00:09:13,010 --> 00:09:16,810
That's all that hard to read to see if I can.

145
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:19,800
OK that's better.

146
00:09:19,820 --> 00:09:22,530
Usually you want to go for something it's symmetrical.

147
00:09:22,530 --> 00:09:25,870
It doesn't waste a ton of space.

148
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:29,250
Shrink this just so not hitting the edges like that.

149
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:33,730
You can do custom font sizes.

150
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:40,410
Or you know the whole thing is that you won't be able to read the quote from a thumbnail but if it's

151
00:09:40,410 --> 00:09:47,430
reduced much more than say like what's in your feed then I mean you can't possibly make it legible at

152
00:09:47,430 --> 00:09:48,280
that point.

153
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:49,740
So OK there you go.

154
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,120
And then we will just copy and paste this to get another text online.

155
00:09:55,140 --> 00:09:59,670
You can just do the same thing over there if you want it to just do things this way.

156
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:00,960
Then don't put his name

157
00:10:04,400 --> 00:10:15,270
and then typically you would want to like change the weight of the font on your we want to

158
00:10:18,590 --> 00:10:18,980
crime.

159
00:10:19,030 --> 00:10:23,190
So to get a person saying it's not usually a big deal there.

160
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:24,630
That's the point of the post.

161
00:10:29,070 --> 00:10:29,350
OK.

162
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:31,100
So I think this is getting better.

163
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:37,500
Last thing I want to do is I want to add in quotes like there's air quotes in the back sometimes of

164
00:10:37,610 --> 00:10:41,250
quotes and one and two.

165
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:47,180
So what I'm going to do with this actually is just turn this white and then lower the capacity to the

166
00:10:47,180 --> 00:10:49,510
point where you can barely see it.

167
00:10:49,580 --> 00:10:52,560
So it would be annoying if I didn't lower the opacity.

168
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,130
But since I do it's like what.

169
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,950
Barely see it.

170
00:10:58,950 --> 00:11:00,270
And that's kind of the point.

171
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:02,640
It's kind of like it's floating in the distance or something.

172
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:07,250
And then you put up here I personally I like when it overlaps a little bit.

173
00:11:09,460 --> 00:11:15,120
Check the transparency setting that but on the other ones to make it match the seven

174
00:11:20,360 --> 00:11:25,540
OK and last adjustments OK.

175
00:11:25,740 --> 00:11:26,200
Cool.

176
00:11:26,260 --> 00:11:28,060
Right so that works.

177
00:11:28,080 --> 00:11:29,220
That's a quote right there.

178
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:29,940
You can read it.

179
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:36,080
It's easy to read got cool colors might all of that posting the same thing over and over again as template.

180
00:11:36,090 --> 00:11:41,790
But this is a good one for if you're just in a jam and you want to just throw up a quote It's always

181
00:11:41,790 --> 00:11:42,780
easy to do.

182
00:11:42,950 --> 00:11:45,410
And it's helpful that I had a template made.

183
00:11:45,480 --> 00:11:49,200
All right now we can look at the beautiful things that we've made.

184
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:56,640
This one quote very nice colors and this one also solid really good colors.

185
00:11:56,640 --> 00:12:00,570
I think that's kind of catchy and then you'd want to read the caption or subscribe or something like

186
00:12:00,570 --> 00:12:01,890
that.

187
00:12:01,940 --> 00:12:06,600
These are pretty easy so I think this is a great strategy for filling in the gaps if you just need to

188
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:07,430
make something really quickly.

189
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,310
You saw that and that took me I don't know 10 minutes to make those two.

190
00:12:11,340 --> 00:12:12,790
You can also show someone else how to do it.

191
00:12:12,780 --> 00:12:13,660
We'll cover that when you can.

192
00:12:13,690 --> 00:12:14,370
On a mission.

193
00:12:14,370 --> 00:12:17,210
But anyway I like the output.

194
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:17,900
Next lecture.
