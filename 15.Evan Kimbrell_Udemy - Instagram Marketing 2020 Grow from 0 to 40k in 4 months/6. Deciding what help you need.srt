00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:01,920
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:08,070
All right so this lecture what we're going to talk about is how do you decide what help you need in

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:09,430
your work flow.

4
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:14,910
OK before we set up a workflow we identify each step in the process.

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:21,660
We've already established to make our photos videos stories boomerangs whatever your media type is the

6
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:28,920
next task was then systematizing out a little bit and putting it into a project management tool called

7
00:00:28,950 --> 00:00:36,420
Trello so that we can see how it works at a larger vantage point and we can see in a linear fashion

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,830
how well we're doing.

9
00:00:37,830 --> 00:00:39,870
What happens first what happens second what happens.

10
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,970
Third and that helps us kind of keep track of the process.

11
00:00:43,020 --> 00:00:45,280
So I really just want you to ask yourself two questions.

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,800
One where if anywhere are you getting stuck.

13
00:00:48,810 --> 00:00:51,390
Or do you feel overloaded in your process.

14
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:58,170
Go back look at the list you made or go to your Trello and see you are a bunch of task getting stuck

15
00:00:58,170 --> 00:00:59,820
in one specific area.

16
00:00:59,860 --> 00:01:02,500
The second question is do you have a budget.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:08,160
Now what we're going to do in this section is we're going to take each individual task group and then

18
00:01:08,160 --> 00:01:12,120
see if we can get someone to efficiently do them.

19
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:16,500
And your budget is going to make a pretty big difference on this and you don't have much of a budget

20
00:01:16,510 --> 00:01:18,530
than you're going to have to do a lot more.

21
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:24,190
You're going to have to oversee the process a lot more and you don't have to work with cheaper freelancers.

22
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,060
But if you have somewhat of a budget well then you can actually step away from this process quite a

23
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:36,460
bit and you can work with people who might actually be better at what the task is than you are.

24
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:40,010
So for example let's look back at my video workflow.

25
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,100
And like I said before I enjoy doing that first task group.

26
00:01:44,130 --> 00:01:46,980
So that was not something I wanted to get help on.

27
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:52,530
Second one writing I thought actually was probably worth getting some help on.

28
00:01:52,530 --> 00:01:55,040
So I want to get a writer for that.

29
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:59,910
The next one is searching for stock video Web sites and YouTube for clips.

30
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:01,710
And then the next one was editing.

31
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:06,270
Now I could set these up into two different task groups have one person do this one person do that.

32
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:12,960
Now the complexity gets a little more complicated when I do that just because now I'm juggling two people

33
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,320
although one person specializing on just finding the clips saves the editor a lot of time.

34
00:02:18,320 --> 00:02:23,940
Editors are generally more expensive than people who just look for media clips.

35
00:02:23,940 --> 00:02:26,900
However that would take a little bit more management time for me.

36
00:02:26,970 --> 00:02:31,290
And then the last thing was just kind of administrative Is that something I want to do or is it something

37
00:02:31,290 --> 00:02:32,540
that I could get somebody else to do.

38
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:36,130
So for me I wanted to have three different positions.

39
00:02:36,150 --> 00:02:42,660
One was this one I'm writing to was putting together the edits and finding the clips and then three

40
00:02:42,660 --> 00:02:45,430
was putting everything together and scheduling it.

41
00:02:45,570 --> 00:02:50,820
So go ahead and do that yourself and then see what areas you think will make sense to see if you can

42
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,410
find someone else to do it.

43
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:56,840
Now let's talk a little bit about what type of help is generally available.

44
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:00,270
Let's say you're doing a themed account like I am doing well.

45
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,370
You know if you're doing quotes Well you can get researchers it's very easy to find people online who

46
00:03:05,370 --> 00:03:10,800
are willing to search through the Internet based on some requirements or basic instructions you give

47
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:16,190
them and then put everything they find into an excel sheet or whatever.

48
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:17,330
So you call that research.

49
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:19,880
Sometimes we'll just call that administration support.

50
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,340
Sometimes you can even call it data entry people like that typically are on the cheaper end of the scale

51
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,070
depending on what kind of research you need.

52
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:35,970
Or you could go as low as $4 an hour and as high as easily $30 an hour if it's something that actually

53
00:03:35,970 --> 00:03:38,460
takes some level of expertise.

54
00:03:38,460 --> 00:03:44,010
Now if I was hiring someone who for instance was researching legal cases then I'd have to pay them a

55
00:03:44,010 --> 00:03:49,350
little bit more because they actually have to understand the cases they find in order to return the

56
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:50,450
information that I want.

57
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:56,340
But if I'm trying to do something really simple like just find a clip that matches the description OK

58
00:03:56,340 --> 00:03:59,280
then that's not exactly the hardest thing in the world to do.

59
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,680
Now there is in general a balance you're going to realize with freelancing.

60
00:04:02,850 --> 00:04:07,110
The more time you spend overseeing the cheaper they can be.

61
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:12,960
You can save money if you offload more of the management more of the quality assurance on yourself.

62
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:18,960
And if you want to step back do less of that and just get someone who understands it pretty quickly

63
00:04:18,960 --> 00:04:21,330
from the get go you're just going to have to pay more.

64
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:25,920
So if your budget is low that just means that you're going to have to spend a lot more time writing

65
00:04:25,920 --> 00:04:31,590
out instructions and giving them detailed step by step instructions for how to finish whatever it is

66
00:04:31,590 --> 00:04:32,490
they're doing.

67
00:04:32,490 --> 00:04:36,910
So like I said researchers can range anywhere from a $4 an hour all the way up to 30.

68
00:04:36,930 --> 00:04:39,730
And again it just depends on what you're trying to do.

69
00:04:39,750 --> 00:04:44,940
Then we have administrative assistants also known as virtual assistants now a virtual assistant or just

70
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:48,210
someone who can do manual tasks for you.

71
00:04:48,210 --> 00:04:53,880
Traditionally they got popular because people started using them to make phone calls and to schedule

72
00:04:53,880 --> 00:04:59,490
appointments or to go through their email and get rid of certain e-mails or to do a lot of these rote

73
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:07,970
manual tasks that virtually anyone could do if say they practiced it for 10 15 minutes no virtual assistance

74
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:14,070
you can get these extremely cheaply you can get them as cheap as $2 an hour and you can also get ones

75
00:05:14,070 --> 00:05:20,460
that are more skilled have actually some critical thinking skills people who can make decisions on a

76
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:25,680
fly who are also local to wherever you are especially if you're in the United States or like Western

77
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,800
Europe that can be helpful for time zone reasons but also language reasons.

78
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:32,370
They have a double kind of the convenience.

79
00:05:32,490 --> 00:05:36,340
And I've seen them go as high as 20 25 dollars an hour.

80
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:42,030
Now the next hireable freelancer that's pretty common is what's called a social media manager and that

81
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:44,230
is actually kind of the same thing.

82
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,710
So that's really just a virtual assistant who just is familiar with using social media.

83
00:05:49,770 --> 00:05:53,730
Typically if you have a virtual assistant you like working with you can just use that person and show

84
00:05:53,730 --> 00:05:57,680
them very quickly how to use the social media platform.

85
00:05:57,690 --> 00:06:03,130
These ones just come with the knowledge kind of pre-baked And so sometimes they know best practices.

86
00:06:03,150 --> 00:06:05,250
But for the most part the really the same thing.

87
00:06:05,310 --> 00:06:09,210
And so the cost to hire one it's roughly the same.

88
00:06:09,210 --> 00:06:13,440
Now the next thing you could easily hire would be say like a writer.

89
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:20,700
Now writers are kind of hard to price out to be honest because just the way that industry the industry

90
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:24,090
works for writers is a bit kind of strange.

91
00:06:24,090 --> 00:06:30,480
A lot of freelance writers are just used to getting paid per word or getting paid per completion or

92
00:06:30,480 --> 00:06:32,210
per page.

93
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,900
They have a lot of strange ways of getting paid if you want to do it say per hour.

94
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:38,320
Wow.

95
00:06:38,340 --> 00:06:44,670
Yeah you can find people say as cheap as if you're ok working with someone who's a non-native English

96
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:45,710
speaker for instance.

97
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:52,100
Cheap is like $4 or $5 an hour depending again how complicated the task is in the U.S. or anywhere that

98
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:58,300
speaks English natively then it's generally the lowest or as seen as probably $8 an hour.

99
00:06:58,320 --> 00:07:01,470
And they can easily go all the way up to 60 dollars an hour.

100
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:07,170
And really just depends on what their skill set is how much work they have how in-demand they are.

101
00:07:07,170 --> 00:07:13,800
Typically writers who are called copywriters they charge a lot more and they do a lot less writing.

102
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:14,280
Why.

103
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,280
Because while they're in charge of writing sentences and the sentences are in charge of conversion rates

104
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:24,420
on pages that can actually end up you know being a big difference and tens of thousands or hundreds

105
00:07:24,420 --> 00:07:25,490
of thousands of dollars.

106
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:32,130
So the writers it's kind of hard to say this stuff that I'm doing for instance I don't think it's really

107
00:07:32,130 --> 00:07:36,070
that hard to make a summary of a new invention.

108
00:07:36,090 --> 00:07:40,290
It's a little complicated and we again like medical science breakthroughs that they have to repeat the

109
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:45,960
information correctly and understand what actually is interesting to highlight that as opposed to just

110
00:07:46,350 --> 00:07:49,470
picking the top five things they can find and turning those into captions.

111
00:07:49,470 --> 00:07:52,970
You can also pay them for things like pay per post.

112
00:07:53,010 --> 00:07:58,620
Like for instance one person I'm working with captions we just had an agreement in their pay I'm paying

113
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:00,580
them I think $12 a caption.

114
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:05,610
It's not really something I'd want to do for the long term but for the very beginning when I'm building

115
00:08:05,610 --> 00:08:11,940
up a big base of post that I can recycle later on I think it's fine because they're really good at it

116
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:12,940
and they're quick at it.

117
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:16,280
Now it's just a negotiated rate that is something you can actually do.

118
00:08:16,290 --> 00:08:20,810
The last thing I'll mention are video editors and again those just range.

119
00:08:20,810 --> 00:08:25,920
I mean you can get them as cheap as $8 an hour all the way up to again like $80 an hour if they're really

120
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:27,290
skilled at what they do.

121
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:33,000
The way we make this cost efficient is if we want to work with a cheap video editors then we give them

122
00:08:33,000 --> 00:08:33,750
some training.

123
00:08:33,750 --> 00:08:36,820
We find people who don't have experience specifically in what we're doing.

124
00:08:36,840 --> 00:08:39,990
They don't have a lot of demand because our skills are still kind of premature.

125
00:08:39,990 --> 00:08:44,760
And then we walk them through the process like we show them how we edited it and then have them mimic

126
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:48,200
that and then slowly over time learn how to improve it.

127
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:53,940
But if you wanted someone who from day one can just jump in and look at one example video and mimic

128
00:08:53,940 --> 00:08:54,960
it and do fine.

129
00:08:54,960 --> 00:08:56,950
And you don't actually have to give a lot of instruction.

130
00:08:56,970 --> 00:09:03,960
You have to pay quite a bit more now for those you doing accounts that require like in person work say

131
00:09:03,960 --> 00:09:08,600
you're hiring a photographer again and that can vary quite a bit.

132
00:09:08,850 --> 00:09:15,670
You can have people who only charge on day rates or half day rates some of them only do packages and

133
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:17,670
some of them will actually do hourly.

134
00:09:17,670 --> 00:09:22,200
So let's say you're a company and you want someone to walk around and take behind the scene shots for

135
00:09:23,070 --> 00:09:24,510
your Instagram account.

136
00:09:24,520 --> 00:09:25,410
You're going to post.

137
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:30,240
Let's say you use these image assets over the next Like month.

138
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:31,650
I mean you could pay them.

139
00:09:31,710 --> 00:09:33,150
It really just depends where you are.

140
00:09:33,150 --> 00:09:39,360
You can find a college student who is interested in photography has an OK camera and has screwed around

141
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:40,690
with it quite a bit.

142
00:09:40,740 --> 00:09:43,490
You can pay them $10 an hour.

143
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:46,140
Are they going to be skillful at just kind of depends.

144
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,620
Again it just depends how hard the actual task is.

145
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:55,740
You give them lots of instruction and tell them take photos of this specifically don't take photos of

146
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:56,130
this.

147
00:09:56,130 --> 00:09:57,960
This is what we want this is what I like to see.

148
00:09:57,960 --> 00:10:03,480
Here's an example then they can be OK but they can also get pretty pricey.

149
00:10:03,520 --> 00:10:07,300
For instance if you work with videographer's it's going to depend on whether or not they have to bring

150
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:08,160
their own equipment.

151
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:13,100
But people who don't have equipment usually charge a day rate of 200 to 400 dollars.

152
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,050
People with equipment certainly depending of its really nice equipment can charge easily from four hundred

153
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:19,420
to nine hundred.

154
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:23,820
And of course you can go below and above that but this seems to be the average range.

155
00:10:23,830 --> 00:10:28,630
So keep that in mind when you're thinking about whether or not you want to find someone else to do each

156
00:10:28,630 --> 00:10:31,090
step in the process for you can you afford it.

157
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,650
And are you willing to put in the time to train them and make sure they eventually get to the point

158
00:10:35,650 --> 00:10:38,300
where they can do this without you watching over their back constantly.

159
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,010
Now the last thing I think worth addressing is the question of whether or not you should get a generalist

160
00:10:42,010 --> 00:10:48,100
or a specialist now or a generalist is a concept meaning it's someone who can do a bunch of different

161
00:10:48,100 --> 00:10:50,730
things and they're probably OK.

162
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,050
And a specialist is someone who is just really good at one specific thing.

163
00:10:55,150 --> 00:11:00,220
If you're hiring specialists that's OK that means that they might be better at one specific task but

164
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:03,420
you have to hire and juggle and manage more of them.

165
00:11:03,490 --> 00:11:10,090
But on the other hand with a generalist they have more experience with the breadth of the tasks so they

166
00:11:10,090 --> 00:11:16,810
can see it from beginning to end and sometimes that has benefits but they won't have specific skills

167
00:11:16,810 --> 00:11:17,600
sometimes.

168
00:11:17,650 --> 00:11:22,270
So for instance let's say you had a virtual assistant that you really liked and you thought hey you

169
00:11:22,270 --> 00:11:26,080
know do you well what you could do is you could train them on how to do the video editing if you think

170
00:11:26,080 --> 00:11:27,300
it's simple enough.

171
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:27,800
OK.

172
00:11:27,820 --> 00:11:33,250
So if they could do the video editing Plus the administration tasks Plus some of the moving stuff around

173
00:11:33,250 --> 00:11:36,950
and research and finding clips Well that would be kind of a generalist.

174
00:11:36,970 --> 00:11:39,910
The benefit there is that it's just more convenient.

175
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:44,920
You can have one person understands the entirety of the project and not just one tiny silo of course

176
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:46,210
with specialists.

177
00:11:46,210 --> 00:11:49,430
You have someone who's really good at one piece.

178
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:54,670
But like I said you have to hire them in multiple sometimes in triplicate usually with a team of specialists.

179
00:11:54,670 --> 00:12:01,480
You spend more time with them but the outcome is usually better assuming you actually pick the right

180
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:02,160
people.

181
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,930
The last one is really good at writing someone is really good at finding great clips.

182
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:09,920
His owner is really good at putting together clips and timing them.

183
00:12:09,970 --> 00:12:12,120
Well then the outcome is going to be pretty good.
