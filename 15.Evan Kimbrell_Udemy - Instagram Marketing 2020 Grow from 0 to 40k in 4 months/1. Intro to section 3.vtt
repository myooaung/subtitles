Hey guys, welcome back.

00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:04.030
Welcome to the brand spanking new section.
2

3
00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:09.690
This section, we have a painfully boring process that
we really need to do if we want to have a complete
3

4
00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:13.020
grip on our account and our marketing strategy.
4

5
00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:19.560
So what we're going to do is lay the groundwork in this section, every procrastinator's worst nightmare. Planning ahead, ew.

7
00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:27.750
We need to figure out, before we dive headfirst into
this vanity fest, who our target audience is, where
7

8
00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:30.300
they reside and distribute their precious likes,
8

9
00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:34.480
and we need to make note of the influencers in our space.
9

10
00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:38.300
If you haven't been indoctrinated by
social media marketing gurus yet,
10

11
00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:43.980
well, the term influencer in this case just means someone
with a lot of followers - they influence other people.

12

13
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:51.300
In our case, we can call pretty much anyone with over
5,000 followers an influencer. Generally, a normal
13

14
00:00:51.300 --> 00:00:54.120
person does not have over 5,000 followers.
14

15
00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.280
We need to know who these people are for two reasons.
15

16
00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:00.480
One, we want to track what they do and learn from them.
16

17
00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:06.420
And two, we need to have them handy when we get to
the promotion part of the course, because we're going
17

18
00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.950
to start reaching out to them.
18

19
00:01:07.950 --> 00:01:13.340
Note to the viewers, if you really don't want to do
this stuff manually, it is kind of time consuming,
19

20
00:01:13.350 --> 00:01:18.360
so you can skip these lectures and just go to the end of
the section, where we do this automatically using an app.

22
00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.670
This is, of course, for people who want to spend some
coin, because, well, it costs money unfortunately.
22

23
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:26.660
We first focus on the free way,
23

24
00:01:26.670 --> 00:01:30.190
basically you being a grunt,
and then the not-so-free ways.
24

25
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:32.760
So, without further ado, let's get our research on.

00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:34.080
See you in the next lecture.
