00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:01.680
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.740 --> 00:00:07.230
So this lecture we're going to continue on in the tools section to go over some more of the functions

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.020
that Jarvi can do for your zombies.

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:13.170
So the next section I think is worth looking at is the unfollow section.

5
00:00:13.170 --> 00:00:14.140
Now follow back.

6
00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.860
Just in case someone follows you you can follow them back.

7
00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:23.490
That's something that's nice but Instagram doesn't really care if you do that and it doesn't necessarily

8
00:00:23.490 --> 00:00:26.040
increase engagement so it's something I generally skip.

9
00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.370
Now go to unfollow now.

10
00:00:27.390 --> 00:00:31.770
This is something that I strongly suggest you run in tandem with your follow.

11
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.290
So if you have your follow tool set up and you have this switch to on then I definitely think you should

12
00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:38.210
be doing your unfallen.

13
00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:44.410
Now reason why is because if you follow Well it's going to start accumulating a lot of followings.

14
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:44.880
Right.

15
00:00:44.910 --> 00:00:50.790
And so it's pretty important that you involve people otherwise you'll end up with 10000 followings and

16
00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.130
100 followers.

17
00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:53.130
That's bad.

18
00:00:53.130 --> 00:00:58.140
Generally speaking if anyone saw that their likelihood of them converting and following you is much

19
00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.710
much lower.

20
00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:04.130
So I'd like to avoid that in order to get this to run in tandem with or follow it's pretty simple though.

21
00:01:04.320 --> 00:01:09.630
We just want to make sure that the maximum unfollowed that it's going to be completing is larger than

22
00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:11.250
the maximum follows.

23
00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:12.040
Right.

24
00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:15.510
So that over time we're not accumulating them.

25
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.130
I've made mistakes where my unfollow bought was like 20 percent less some I follow.

26
00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:25.170
And then as you can imagine after a month those oh my god I'm following so many people.

27
00:01:25.170 --> 00:01:30.950
So here it works very very similarly and feel free to just copy the settings I have.

28
00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.650
I don't really need to get into every single one.

29
00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:37.570
So we have to run timers we have things like unfollow items after a minimum of blank.

30
00:01:37.570 --> 00:01:41.000
Now this is something that people will argue about for days.

31
00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:45.300
How long do you wait before you unfollow someone because it's very often that you follow someone then

32
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:50.280
the next day you unfollow them and they just hadn't checked their Instagram in a day so they might see

33
00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:55.320
it and then you know get turned off by the fact you're not following them anymore and they can see that.

34
00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.120
And so they don't reciprocate.

35
00:01:57.120 --> 00:01:58.880
So that's something to keep in mind.

36
00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:05.910
I have it at once because I don't like the lag because the lag will always make it such that I'm following

37
00:02:05.910 --> 00:02:08.860
too many people especially if I'm going aggressive on the follow bot.

38
00:02:08.880 --> 00:02:10.500
So I like to set this at one.

39
00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:14.930
So really only a 24 hour period where I have people I follow but haven't yet.

40
00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:20.390
Unfollowed so they have weighed between 10 and 15 minutes for each operation and each operation is three

41
00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:20.840
to seven.

42
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:26.340
Now remember my thing was four to eight but I have my settings down here as slightly larger so it just

43
00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:31.160
runs over a longer period of time than I have a delay of three to 50 seconds.

44
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.760
Again here doesn't really matter.

45
00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:37.550
Just make sure that you have a decent healthy range so that you're not just another long thought on

46
00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:41.510
Father follow because that looks really bad if you tried to do that on your phone.

47
00:02:41.550 --> 00:02:47.850
It'll drive you crazy and if you keep doing it too much Instagram will think that something weird is

48
00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:49.290
going on then.

49
00:02:49.290 --> 00:02:50.290
Same rules apply.

50
00:02:50.310 --> 00:02:55.620
Have the execute between a certain period of time I do this up with my follow so that it's unfolding

51
00:02:55.650 --> 00:02:59.490
roughly the same time and sleeping at roughly the same time same at the same.

52
00:02:59.550 --> 00:03:04.320
Here with days kind of weird if for instance you weren't following on Saturdays but you were an following

53
00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:05.210
on Saturdays.

54
00:03:05.310 --> 00:03:09.480
That would just look strange that if only your activity on Saturday was following that would look kind

55
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:10.340
of like a bot.

56
00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:17.910
Now I'm on a maximum of I put this just really really high because I just don't want to have accrued

57
00:03:18.330 --> 00:03:19.630
lists of followers.

58
00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.500
I just set this really really high.

59
00:03:21.660 --> 00:03:24.660
If I don't have enough people unfollow it's automatically going to stop.

60
00:03:24.660 --> 00:03:26.800
So I'm not really worried about that.

61
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.540
So that's why I set this maximum.

62
00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:31.740
And then if you remember the maximum for follow is eight hundred.

63
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:34.400
Well I put my maximum unfollowed a 20.

64
00:03:34.410 --> 00:03:35.950
So it's just always higher.

65
00:03:35.970 --> 00:03:40.360
Like I said it's really important so that you don't end up accumulating too many.

66
00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.990
So here you have some other settings you can really get into.

67
00:03:42.990 --> 00:03:46.280
I don't know that these are super important.

68
00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:51.450
One thing I like to do is say do not fall unfollow likers because if you find someone who then goes

69
00:03:51.450 --> 00:03:55.680
on like some of your posts that means that that person is probably pretty engaged so I like to treat

70
00:03:55.680 --> 00:03:57.330
them a little bit different.

71
00:03:57.330 --> 00:04:01.330
I like to make sure they don't give them any reason to unfollow because these people are active.

72
00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:01.890
That's great.

73
00:04:01.890 --> 00:04:03.320
Same with commenters.

74
00:04:03.450 --> 00:04:07.980
Now up here I have things like delaying your unfollow for people who follow back.

75
00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:12.690
So if I follow and they follow back I don't immediately just unfollow them because they might actually

76
00:04:12.690 --> 00:04:13.730
lose that follower.

77
00:04:13.730 --> 00:04:17.710
You also do things like targeting users that follow from outside of Jarvi.

78
00:04:17.780 --> 00:04:24.300
I don't really know why that setting even exists here you can say like I only want to unfollow people

79
00:04:24.330 --> 00:04:26.650
that have the right ratio.

80
00:04:26.670 --> 00:04:31.740
But again it just doesn't really matter to me whether you unfollow them and that necessarily means they

81
00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:35.070
follow you is kind of it's kind of unclear.

82
00:04:35.070 --> 00:04:39.470
I've had people follow me and they're great users and I immediately unfold them and it wasn't a problem.

83
00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:44.160
Some other settings like do not unfollowed DMARDs I don't like to set that one because a lot of people

84
00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:47.500
use auto response bots so they'll automatically DMH you.

85
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.970
So I that's.

86
00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.300
There's too many bots to do that.

87
00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.060
That's not exactly what I'm shooting for here.

88
00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.100
Some other things you can do like.

89
00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.490
Like Will an following.

90
00:04:56.490 --> 00:04:57.270
That's just one thing.

91
00:04:57.270 --> 00:04:59.260
You go and you like a thing where you involve them.

92
00:04:59.260 --> 00:04:59.580
OK.

93
00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:04.440
That's pretty much all you need to know but unfollow we can go over to like and like I said this is

94
00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:05.880
not something I usually run.

95
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.900
So I try to be conservative with this.

96
00:05:10.050 --> 00:05:14.370
If you do end up doing it make sure it's running during the same period of time as everything else you

97
00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:15.790
look like a normal person.

98
00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:22.200
Make sure that you are waiting time between each new operation and that when you do like posts you don't

99
00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.300
just go crazy remember.

100
00:05:23.310 --> 00:05:26.560
What would a human do with a human like 50 post at once.

101
00:05:26.580 --> 00:05:28.490
Now I'd probably like two to five.

102
00:05:28.490 --> 00:05:30.280
That's a good setting for me.

103
00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:34.890
I'd like to also wait 30 60 seconds because I mean how long do you look at a post for you like it.

104
00:05:34.890 --> 00:05:35.510
Right.

105
00:05:35.610 --> 00:05:37.050
Could be 30 seconds could be 60.

106
00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.080
I mean you could lower this if you wanted to that seems to be pretty normal.

107
00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.880
Same thing out here we have like limits.

108
00:05:41.880 --> 00:05:46.160
One thing you just keep in mind is that generally speaking 400 is going to be your maximum.

109
00:05:46.170 --> 00:05:50.880
And again that's even if you choose to use liking I generally don't even like to use this like tool

110
00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.620
because I use things like liking after unveiling and liking after following.

111
00:05:55.620 --> 00:06:02.370
And I prefer to do to use my likes there as opposed to here because I'm more likely to get flagged.

112
00:06:02.370 --> 00:06:04.280
It just looks to body.

113
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:09.510
So one thing I think also is pretty useful is if you do like user's most recent posts so the last three

114
00:06:09.510 --> 00:06:14.760
most recent posts it's not particularly helpful to like say like an old post because they're just less

115
00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:17.030
likely to see that.

116
00:06:17.310 --> 00:06:22.320
But also it kind of looks like a robot doing that because if someone were to look at your account they're

117
00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:27.510
not going to flip like your oldest post ever and like that so that can kind of get out of control.

118
00:06:27.510 --> 00:06:32.970
I personally like to limit the maximum number of legs per user to two and that's just because you're

119
00:06:32.970 --> 00:06:38.670
not going to get their attention because you LIKE FIVE post versus two you hit diminishing returns pretty

120
00:06:38.670 --> 00:06:41.150
quickly and only going 400 a day.

121
00:06:41.250 --> 00:06:41.930
Wow.

122
00:06:41.970 --> 00:06:43.950
I mean you just can't hit as many people.

123
00:06:43.950 --> 00:06:47.210
Then I have the basic user filters that I use for following.

124
00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:51.380
I don't like to do it to non-English accounts because they're not going to follow me back.

125
00:06:51.390 --> 00:06:55.020
Usually has a profile image make sure that they're real.

126
00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.700
And that's pretty much the same thing you saw in the follow section where here I post filters and this

127
00:06:59.700 --> 00:07:02.940
is just another way of drilling down on which posts you like.

128
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.880
So for instance I say within the last 60 days.

129
00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:08.340
But again I said before it's the last three.

130
00:07:08.340 --> 00:07:12.810
So this would be the case of the person only posts like once every 20 days or something.

131
00:07:12.810 --> 00:07:19.350
I just want to make sure that I have multiple limits to make sure I am only liking things that look

132
00:07:19.350 --> 00:07:19.990
normal.

133
00:07:20.010 --> 00:07:23.550
Also here's a really important one I find is that filter posts by number of likes.

134
00:07:23.550 --> 00:07:29.520
Now the reason why is because if someone has say like four thousand likes on a post they're just not

135
00:07:29.520 --> 00:07:30.900
going to notice that you liked it.

136
00:07:30.900 --> 00:07:32.130
You're just not going to get their attention.

137
00:07:32.130 --> 00:07:34.350
So I like to limit it to two hundred.

138
00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:39.720
That is more likely to get attention from personal accounts if I just have a personal account.

139
00:07:39.790 --> 00:07:41.250
Tryna grow the account.

140
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.030
I'm not going to be getting that many likes.

141
00:07:43.110 --> 00:07:44.700
So I think 200 is pretty normal.

142
00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:48.060
And in that case I'm also going to be checking out people who interact with my account and I'm not going

143
00:07:48.060 --> 00:07:51.900
be overwhelmed by how many people are interacting like an innovation station.

144
00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:57.060
Every post we get gets like 4000 likes so I can't possibly read through all of those and look at every

145
00:07:57.060 --> 00:07:58.010
single person.

146
00:07:58.030 --> 00:08:00.960
Last thing I have is choose a random post from most recent users post.

147
00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.570
That just means of the three within 60 days.

148
00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:10.410
If I'm only liking to just randomize it because if I don't click this it'll just like the first two

149
00:08:10.410 --> 00:08:12.440
and the last three within 60 days.

150
00:08:12.450 --> 00:08:14.350
I know this can get kind of confusing.

151
00:08:14.370 --> 00:08:16.410
It's really just experiment.

152
00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:17.400
Trial and error.

153
00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:18.390
OK now moving on.

154
00:08:18.390 --> 00:08:19.160
Comment.

155
00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:19.970
I don't do it.

156
00:08:19.980 --> 00:08:21.880
I strongly suggest you don't do it.

157
00:08:21.990 --> 00:08:24.060
It's just not something worth getting into.

158
00:08:24.060 --> 00:08:27.660
It looks incredibly spammy to me that people do it.

159
00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:29.240
Same story for direct messages.

160
00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:31.070
Now this is something that maybe later on.

161
00:08:31.110 --> 00:08:34.640
Once you've an account that's pretty much free and clear it's not getting flagged anymore.

162
00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:39.240
That could be pretty useful because you could direct message them and say Hey check out my main account

163
00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.220
and that is pretty effective.

164
00:08:41.220 --> 00:08:45.110
Again though you've got to think about what a normal person would do.

165
00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:48.220
Is that common for someone to send the same message over and over to someone.

166
00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.410
All right I wasn't going to skip over manage comments delete posted comments because that's not something

167
00:08:52.410 --> 00:08:53.580
I use Jarvi to manage.

168
00:08:53.580 --> 00:09:01.050
I just do that myself but also I'm not trying to cure rate my posts that heavily with a robot account

169
00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:03.330
so I generally don't care about it.

170
00:09:03.330 --> 00:09:05.160
Also the name of block followers.

171
00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.410
OK now let's hit repo's now as a very important one.

172
00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:12.440
This is basically all all the magic happens with regards to your content.

173
00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:18.150
OK so here we have virtually the same thing right we have run timers now we have to wait between a certain

174
00:09:18.150 --> 00:09:22.130
period of time for each operation and each operation is going to be posting something.

175
00:09:22.130 --> 00:09:25.380
So we have again think what's a human going to do.

176
00:09:25.410 --> 00:09:29.520
How often every hour to two hours.

177
00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:35.220
Is this account going to post what's a normal human do another human doesn't post 2 times an hour in

178
00:09:35.220 --> 00:09:36.780
normal human post like.

179
00:09:37.020 --> 00:09:42.780
I don't know two three times a day if it's a business account maybe four or five six times something

180
00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:43.170
like that.

181
00:09:43.170 --> 00:09:45.190
So these are settings I use.

182
00:09:45.390 --> 00:09:50.880
Generally I like to wait one or two hours for each operation each operation is just one post that can

183
00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:55.140
get out of hand if you say too many because it also doesn't make sense to posts like five posts all

184
00:09:55.140 --> 00:09:55.900
at once.

185
00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.400
And then obviously this doesn't mean anything because I'm only posting one thing time but if you are

186
00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:01.120
posting to.

187
00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.350
Then you tell it to wait between each post.

188
00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.550
And I would massively inflate these then down here we have X CUPE between same settings as before.

189
00:10:08.590 --> 00:10:11.670
Roughly the same period of time that we're awake supposedly.

190
00:10:11.710 --> 00:10:18.280
Then you have repo's elements so reposed a maximum of certain per day and it doesn't really matter to

191
00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.610
me because it's only going to be going off of one account.

192
00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:25.990
This is useful if you have a lot of different sources that you're pulling repo's from.

193
00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:31.410
Down here we have posters and again these are somewhat useful just kind of depends on your strategy

194
00:10:31.420 --> 00:10:33.310
and there's really no wrong answer.

195
00:10:33.310 --> 00:10:39.100
So for instance we can repost only images videos or images and videos or just albums for you know if

196
00:10:39.100 --> 00:10:41.680
you wanted to make an account only post photos.

197
00:10:41.680 --> 00:10:46.120
Well then you go with images or only post videos your videos or just an image or video because innovation

198
00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:48.610
station does both so I don't want to discriminate against that.

199
00:10:48.610 --> 00:10:54.160
Now you can also drill down unlike what the most common ones were filter by ones that are really popular

200
00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:58.360
or filter my number of comments so these are actually pretty useful if you only want your zombies to

201
00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.930
be posting the best of.

202
00:10:59.980 --> 00:11:03.670
But you'll notice that if your main account hasn't been posting a lot that it doesn't have a lot to

203
00:11:03.670 --> 00:11:08.480
choose from and so it'll actually end up posting the same things over and over again.

204
00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:11.120
And that's something I kind of ran into.

205
00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:13.760
Now this is one thing that I personally like to do.

206
00:11:13.900 --> 00:11:16.710
And again it's something you have to tweak.

207
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:21.850
I like to filter by percentage of engagement so repo's only if the engagement is greater than the average

208
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:23.200
for all their posts.

209
00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:30.080
I said like 30 percent I might lower this rate just because I don't want to only post the best posts

210
00:11:30.100 --> 00:11:35.440
over and over again but I think 30 percent is a pretty healthy range innovation station at this point

211
00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.780
has something like 600 posts so 30 percent over the engagement could easily mean that it's picking from

212
00:11:40.810 --> 00:11:44.910
a pool of you know 300 posts or something like that.

213
00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:48.910
So I think that's a generally decent strategy to use.

214
00:11:48.920 --> 00:11:50.650
There are other repots settings.

215
00:11:50.650 --> 00:11:55.540
These are things I don't really get into but you can post on your wall and in your story if you want

216
00:11:55.540 --> 00:11:57.520
to really really hammer this home.

217
00:11:57.520 --> 00:11:58.400
Just keep in mind.

218
00:11:58.510 --> 00:12:03.490
I think if you're going to be automatically posting your story then that's hard to manage when you have

219
00:12:03.490 --> 00:12:04.860
lots and lots of zombies.

220
00:12:04.930 --> 00:12:09.490
If people aren't watching your stories then it's just a waste because those stories will just get filtered

221
00:12:09.550 --> 00:12:11.560
out and people won't even see them really.

222
00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:16.810
So one of the things I incorporated original post location and repo's original video cover.

223
00:12:16.810 --> 00:12:17.200
Why.

224
00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:21.930
Because my main account always has locations attached to it.

225
00:12:21.970 --> 00:12:27.280
You kind of go back and look at our content strategy we covered why do that and then include the video

226
00:12:27.280 --> 00:12:30.840
cover because otherwise it's going to grab its own video cover which might just look weird.

227
00:12:30.880 --> 00:12:35.320
And again my goal here is to draw attention to the main account so doesn't make sense to post a video

228
00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:38.290
of a robot that clicked on the main account and the cover is different.

229
00:12:38.290 --> 00:12:39.390
They won't even recognize it.

230
00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:41.890
There's some other ones like change profile picture if you repost.

231
00:12:41.890 --> 00:12:44.800
I think that's incredibly strange to be honest.

232
00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:47.430
But it's something you could do.

233
00:12:47.470 --> 00:12:52.900
I think it's just so that people visually don't recognize you as this bot that's posting the same thing

234
00:12:52.900 --> 00:12:53.880
over and over again.

235
00:12:53.890 --> 00:12:55.510
Now out here we have post-captain tax.

236
00:12:55.510 --> 00:12:58.920
Now this is something that you'll spend a lot of time on.

237
00:12:58.930 --> 00:12:59.380
Why.

238
00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:04.120
Because this is really the best way you can draw attention to your main account since the whole point

239
00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.300
of a zombie is to get people to go to your main account.

240
00:13:06.310 --> 00:13:11.290
We need a tactful way of bringing up hey there's other count and it's great.

241
00:13:11.290 --> 00:13:16.190
So what I use is reposte from this username and that's innovation station.

242
00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:17.560
And I think that's pretty normal.

243
00:13:17.590 --> 00:13:19.390
People are used to seeing that.

244
00:13:19.510 --> 00:13:24.040
It's not a great way of getting people to click it but it's a tactful way of doing it without looking

245
00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:25.630
too spammy.

246
00:13:25.630 --> 00:13:28.440
They also follow innovation and tech and trends.

247
00:13:28.510 --> 00:13:30.750
That's something that I post on innovations in any way.

248
00:13:30.760 --> 00:13:34.030
So I don't know then what I have is here is a comment.

249
00:13:34.030 --> 00:13:38.000
Now if you noticed down here these are all what are called wildcards.

250
00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:43.120
So if I put for instance like original post-captain I click this it'll add it.

251
00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:47.640
And that means it'll take that original post caption and post it right there.

252
00:13:47.640 --> 00:13:51.130
It's not going to post a bracket that says original post caption.

253
00:13:51.130 --> 00:13:56.680
So that's just a way of kind of getting fancy and making your captions really dynamic.

254
00:13:56.680 --> 00:14:01.690
Personally I like to keep the simple but you can make these really elaborate and such that every single

255
00:14:01.690 --> 00:14:03.340
one looks different.

256
00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.210
And to a normal human it doesn't look like you're just auto posting.

257
00:14:07.270 --> 00:14:09.210
Personally in the past what I use you as habit.

258
00:14:09.210 --> 00:14:13.280
Repost the caption because I liked my captions innovations.

259
00:14:13.300 --> 00:14:19.690
But what I found out is that that looks too spammy to Instagram so I stopped doing that and Seagram

260
00:14:19.690 --> 00:14:20.890
can notice that pretty quickly.

261
00:14:20.890 --> 00:14:27.370
Now what comment is is actually just a function that means if I put comment then anything that I write

262
00:14:27.370 --> 00:14:29.910
pass comment will show up in the first comment.

263
00:14:29.920 --> 00:14:33.260
So Jari is smart enough that I can automatically post in your comment.

264
00:14:33.310 --> 00:14:40.240
So for instance I wanted to only tag innovation nation in the comment but not the caption I could comment

265
00:14:40.330 --> 00:14:43.510
and then this username add that right there.

266
00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:46.680
OK now down here you can do things like find a replace.

267
00:14:46.690 --> 00:14:51.340
So what that would mean is you can look for certain keywords in the camps and replace them with your

268
00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:51.670
own.

269
00:14:51.670 --> 00:14:56.350
Again it's just another level you can go if you really want to make this dynamic.

270
00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.610
But then the last thing is a naval dynamic hash tags and this is preferrable what I use.

271
00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:05.110
So each one of my zombie's has a different list of hashtags that it uses.

272
00:15:05.110 --> 00:15:09.970
I don't want to post in the same exact things because that could look a little spammy but also it's

273
00:15:09.970 --> 00:15:15.760
kind of over using the hash tag exposure that you have from your main accounts of your main accounts

274
00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:17.640
posting on hash like technology.

275
00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:23.350
I don't want 30 zombies also posting on hash tag technology of the same exact post that will start to

276
00:15:23.350 --> 00:15:24.540
look like spam.

277
00:15:24.550 --> 00:15:29.890
So what I did here is I put Max hash tags per post 2:33 now remember.

278
00:15:29.950 --> 00:15:32.440
You might as well post as many as you possibly can.

279
00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:35.800
I'd like to add a little variety just because Instagram likes to see a little variety.

280
00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.100
But again there's no reason why you shouldn't post the most.

281
00:15:38.260 --> 00:15:45.580
Then I just put two different lists and it will pick half of you know 13 to 15 from here and half from

282
00:15:45.580 --> 00:15:51.360
here and I just mix them up and that's the way that I guarantee that it has a good healthy mix.

283
00:15:51.430 --> 00:15:57.790
OK next lecture we're going to wrap up this by looking at users and hash tags and maybe a little bit

284
00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.490
like the story viewer.

285
00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:00.360
And that's it.

286
00:16:00.370 --> 00:16:01.180
OK I see that.
