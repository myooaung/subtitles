00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:00.900
All right, guys.
1

2
00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:07.230
Welcome back to the course. So this lecture we're going
to talk about the first way of monetizing your account that
2

3
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.040
we talked about before, and that is
selling shoutouts or selling promotions.
3

4
00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:15.450
Now, in general, when we're talking about
selling shoutouts or selling promotions,
4

5
00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:20.340
I think you have a decent idea of what I'm talking
about, mainly because previously in the course we
5

6
00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:29.130
did paid shoutouts and shout for shouts, but in case
you forgot, a shoutout is essentially when you repost
6

7
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:35.040
a post from another account and they either pay you
to do it or they give you some type of reciprocal
7

8
00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:37.700
offering, like they put something on their own.
8

9
00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:42.930
Now, when we're talking about monetizing your account,
we're talking about charging people to repost their
9

10
00:00:42.930 --> 00:00:51.650
post, post like a promo video potentially, or to promote
a product or service for a legitimate business.
10

11
00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:56.280
Now, in general this is going to break
down into two different categories.
11

12
00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:03.690
One, you could potentially start selling shoutouts
to people that have their own Instagram account,
12

13
00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:08.280
and in that case you're just going to be posting
something that they've made that's very attractive
13

14
00:01:08.280 --> 00:01:12.010
or picking one of their best videos and
then driving traffic to their account.
14

15
00:01:12.030 --> 00:01:21.060
The other option is to sell actual promotions to
some business or service or tool or some other type
15

16
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:24.590
of actual product that isn't just an Instagram account.
16

17
00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:30.180
Now, when we're talking about selling shoutouts
for promotion of an instagram account,
17

18
00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.130
keep in mind, it's kind of a limited market, since
a lot of the people that are buying shoutouts
18

19
00:01:35.610 --> 00:01:41.730
to promote their own accounts are really only doing
that at the very beginning as a way to get a leg up
19

20
00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:44.280
and a start in growing their account.
20

21
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:48.480
Also, in general, the people that are using this to grow
their accounts are using this as a means to an end.
21

22
00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:49.420
Also, in general, the people that are using this to grow
their accounts are using this as a means to an end.
22

23
00:01:49.470 --> 00:01:55.760
So you're not really getting to them at the
most valuable point of their business growth.
23

24
00:01:55.770 --> 00:02:01.080
Typically speaking, people are probably growing their
account for one of the four reasons we have listed
24

25
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.990
here for monetizing your account,
and later on, when they're larger,
25

26
00:02:05.010 --> 00:02:08.610
that's actually when they have a higher ability to pay.
26

27
00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:10.350
So promoting Instagram accounts,
27

28
00:02:10.380 --> 00:02:15.450
I think there's a limited market, but you could definitely
make a business off of doing this and a lot of people do,
28

29
00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:16.450
I think there's a limited market, but you could definitely
make a business off of doing this and a lot of people do,
29

30
00:02:16.530 --> 00:02:18.170
so don't obviously discount that.
30

31
00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:24.090
There are accounts that have several million
followers, but they can easily make a thousand
31

32
00:02:24.090 --> 00:02:30.420
dollars a day just by doing one post, I've even seen accounts
that do three posts a day and then they just immediately
32

33
00:02:30.420 --> 00:02:34.830
delete them later and their prices
are, you know, like $500 a post.
33

34
00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:40.560
Now, if you want to pursue this path of being able
to sell paid promotions or paid shoutouts, it kind
34

35
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:43.620
of starts at the beginning, and you guys are going to
hate me because I'm going to keep saying this during
35

36
00:02:43.620 --> 00:02:50.130
this monetizing your account section, you kind of
have to think, when you first start the account,
36

37
00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:55.200
"Who exactly am I going to be able
to promote?" Innovation Station,
37

38
00:02:55.200 --> 00:03:01.150
we do tech, innovation, gadgets, science.
*-Yes, science!
-Okay.*
38

39
00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:02.240
we do tech, innovation, gadgets, science.
*-Yes, science!
-Okay.*
39

40
00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:11.830
So we have an obvious group of people out there
that might potentially want exposure on our account.
40

41
00:03:11.830 --> 00:03:17.920
Now, if you make an account that posts memes, well,
then keep in mind that you're probably only going
41

42
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:23.170
to be able to sell promotions to other meme accounts
or maybe someone's making a website that's based
42

43
00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:25.450
on memes, it's a very limited market
43

44
00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:31.810
if this is your monetization strategy. Now, with regards
to pre-planning, there's no real difference between
44

45
00:03:31.810 --> 00:03:37.150
trying to sell shoutouts to other accounts and trying to sell
shoutouts to companies or businesses and actual products.
45

46
00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.260
trying to sell shoutouts to other accounts and trying to sell
shoutouts to companies or businesses and actual products.
46

47
00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:39.460
It's kind of the same thing.
47

48
00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:42.490
You have to think about your brand.
48

49
00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:45.840
Are you going to create an account
that is perceived as high quality?
49

50
00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:51.880
And are you going to be operating in a niche where
there's obviously going to be a lot of potential
50

51
00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:58.600
people who could pay you for promotion? If you were
to create an account in, let's say, food, that's going
51

52
00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:00.010
to be probably a limited market.
52

53
00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:04.990
I mean, you're probably only going to be able to sell to
other accounts that are selling food, or you know, maybe
53

54
00:04:04.990 --> 00:04:09.060
you get lucky and you can strike a deal with Blue
Apron or something like that, but just keep in mind,
54

55
00:04:09.340 --> 00:04:11.170
that's a pretty narrow field, right?
55

56
00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:17.830
Technology has a lot of different side industries, like
I was saying, like gadgets or just phones specifically,
56

57
00:04:18.100 --> 00:04:21.340
that could potentially match up,
so I have a lot more options.
57

58
00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:26.680
Now, let's talk about when you can do this, when can
you start actually selling paid shoutouts and promotions?
58

59
00:04:27.220 --> 00:04:28.780
And it's going to depend on two different things.
59

60
00:04:28.780 --> 00:04:35.110
One, when do you want to monetize your account? And
two, how seamlessly can you add in paid shoutouts or
60

61
00:04:35.110 --> 00:04:38.120
promotions without it looking like an ad?
61

62
00:04:38.170 --> 00:04:44.410
Now, the only real risk here is if you put in a paid
promotion and it's just not up to par with the rest
62

63
00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.410
of your posts, it's distracting,
63

64
00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:49.300
it's spammy, it's overly salesy,
64

65
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:54.130
that could actually damage your account, and anybody
who's coming to your account, even your regulars,
65

66
00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:56.050
could easily get turned off by that.
66

67
00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.670
So the question is, what ads can you safely go after?
67

68
00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:06.940
And have you figured out a way to incorporate ads in a
way that's unobtrusive, but also effective at getting attention?
68

69
00:05:06.940 --> 00:05:07.990
And have you figured out a way to incorporate ads in a
way that's unobtrusive, but also effective at getting attention?
69

70
00:05:07.990 --> 00:05:10.570
Now, the other question is, when
do you want to monetize this?
70

71
00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.970
And again, it's kind of personal preference. What
I say is, first focus on figuring out a way that you
71

72
00:05:15.970 --> 00:05:19.830
can post these without them being too
obnoxious or detracting from your account,
72

73
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:23.410
and if you can get to that point, then it doesn't matter
when you monetize it, because everything you're
73

74
00:05:23.410 --> 00:05:26.080
posting isn't actually going to hurt your account.
74

75
00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:32.890
It's only when we're talking about posts that are just
spammy and damaging that you might actually think
75

76
00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:35.710
about pushing off the monetization on your account till later.
76

77
00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:41.610
All right, now let's talk about the two different ways
that you can solicit ads or solicit paid promotions.
77

78
00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:45.550
One is inbound and one is outbound. For inbound, the strategy is
78

79
00:05:45.550 --> 00:05:48.700
pretty simple actually, you just put it in your bio.
79

80
00:05:48.790 --> 00:05:49.690
If you look at Innovation Station,
80

81
00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:54.910
we have four lines, we could use any one of those
lines in order to tell people that, hey, we're open for
81

82
00:05:54.910 --> 00:05:57.170
business for selling paid promotions.
82

83
00:05:57.190 --> 00:05:59.060
Typically you see people,
83

84
00:05:59.170 --> 00:06:03.940
some people are really cavalier about this and they
just put "For paid promotions" and then they'll put
84

85
00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:11.260
a contact piece, either it's their Gmail address, their Kik
messenger, or even just "DM us for paid promotions."
85

86
00:06:11.260 --> 00:06:12.190
a contact piece, either it's their Gmail address, their Kik
messenger, or even just "DM us for paid promotions."
86

87
00:06:12.190 --> 00:06:19.270
Now, I obviously don't like that, I don't like it when
you're too obvious about what you're promoting,
87

88
00:06:19.270 --> 00:06:23.460
because if you're a casual follower and you came to their
account and you liked their content, and you're wondering
88

89
00:06:23.460 --> 00:06:26.940
about whether or not you should hit follow and
see them in your feed for the rest of your life,
89

90
00:06:27.100 --> 00:06:33.100
you're going to see that line that says "Message us for paid
shoutouts" and that's going to make you think that they,
90

91
00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:34.080
you're going to see that line that says "Message us for paid
shoutouts" and that's going to make you think that they,
91

92
00:06:34.300 --> 00:06:35.770
yeah, they sell themselves out,
92

93
00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.720
so occasionally you're going to get slammed with ads.
93

94
00:06:37.750 --> 00:06:39.340
Nobody likes ads.
94

95
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:42.630
That's just a fact of nature, especially on social media.
95

96
00:06:42.650 --> 00:06:49.840
That's why I say do something more tactful. Try to make
it actually sound like you are using this messaging
96

97
00:06:50.110 --> 00:06:52.750
to improve your content strategy, right?
97

98
00:06:52.750 --> 00:06:56.220
So as opposed to saying "DM for paid shoutout rates,"
98

99
00:06:56.320 --> 00:06:57.670
you could just say something like
99

100
00:06:57.670 --> 00:06:58.930
"Want to be featured? DM us."
100

101
00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:00.370
"Want to be featured? DM us."
101

102
00:07:00.490 --> 00:07:02.190
Especially in the case of Innovation Station,
102

103
00:07:02.200 --> 00:07:04.490
we highlight interesting technology,
103

104
00:07:04.510 --> 00:07:09.670
so it would make sense that, hey, maybe someone might
contact us and say, "Hey, we have some great technology."
104

105
00:07:09.820 --> 00:07:13.930
You as the user don't know what we're actually
going to discuss behind the scenes,
105

106
00:07:13.930 --> 00:07:19.030
so you don't know if there is a very rigid
quality check for everything we post.
106

107
00:07:19.030 --> 00:07:24.100
It also doesn't advertise that you're featurings are
paid, so you'll get a lot of attention from people
107

108
00:07:24.370 --> 00:07:26.260
who want to pay and people who don't want to pay,
108

109
00:07:26.260 --> 00:07:27.370
but it's very easy,
109

110
00:07:27.430 --> 00:07:31.840
behind the scenes, in your direct message or in your
email, to explain to them, "Hey, actually we do featuring
110

111
00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:35.910
for money, not just for giggles."
111

112
00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:42.160
Now, if we were to take a peek at our DMs on Innovation
Station, we can actually see that this has started
112

113
00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:48.690
happening, and we were not even that explicit
about the fact that we are open to promotions.
113

114
00:07:48.730 --> 00:07:52.150
So our thing says "Open to submissions.
114

115
00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:56.800
DM us." Now, submissions might be you just found
something interesting and you want us to cover it,
115

116
00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:59.300
doesn't actually imply that it's yours.
116

117
00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:02.400
So if we just go to our DMs, we can fish some of these out.
117

118
00:08:02.530 --> 00:08:09.430
So just kind of digging through these, let's see, this
person, they asked "Hey, how much for a stories post?"
118

119
00:08:09.430 --> 00:08:11.650
See, I didn't, I wasn't even soliciting this.
119

120
00:08:11.650 --> 00:08:13.920
And I could respond, say, $50 bucks.
120

121
00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:19.480
And whether or not that pricing is in line with what
people actually charge, you know, that conversation
121

122
00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:20.500
could actually go somewhere.
122

123
00:08:20.620 --> 00:08:21.540
Here's another one.
123

124
00:08:21.640 --> 00:08:25.460
"Hello, I was wondering if I could advertise my
solar powered phone chargers on your page."
124

125
00:08:25.470 --> 00:08:25.740
"Hello, I was wondering if I could advertise my
solar powered phone chargers on your page."
125

126
00:08:25.750 --> 00:08:31.880
And they're saying "advertise," and advertise is not
a free posting, that's implying that they'll pay you.
126

127
00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:35.130
So, you know, those are just two that I recently found.
127

128
00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:42.280
I've had probably 10 or 12 people message me asking
whether or not I do paid promotions or at least
128

129
00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:47.380
implying that they'd like to pay for it, then it's kind
of up to me obviously to choose whether or not
129

130
00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.000
I want to feature them and what to charge.
130

131
00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.250
Now, the alternative to this easy, lazy inbound strategy
is the outbound strategy, and that means actively
131

132
00:08:54.250 --> 00:08:58.180
going out and finding potential
advertisers and then messaging them.
132

133
00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.580
Now, you can either do this on Instagram, you can go
and look around in your niche to see other accounts
133

134
00:09:03.610 --> 00:09:11.650
that are growing really fast or you've seen them post
ads somewhere else, and then easily just kind of
134

135
00:09:11.650 --> 00:09:16.600
either making a list and contacting them all or just one
by one once you find somebody who's in your space
135

136
00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:21.200
who could potentially be interested in doing
a shoutout, just messaging them directly.
136

137
00:09:21.280 --> 00:09:25.960
Alternatively, you can actually expand this quite a bit
and you can start messaging companies themselves.
137

138
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:30.670
You know, if there's a product or a service you think
really, really fits well with your audience, something
138

139
00:09:30.670 --> 00:09:32.740
your audience would really, really care about,
139

140
00:09:32.950 --> 00:09:37.150
then you actually reach out to them directly. Like
in the case of Innovation Station, it'd be very easy
140

141
00:09:37.150 --> 00:09:43.720
for me to just go on a Kickstarter and find a bunch
of really interesting tech gadgets and then offer
141

142
00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.310
them something. Say, "Hey, I'll post on my
account highlighting your thing, featuring it,
142

143
00:09:48.340 --> 00:09:54.280
if you pay a certain amount of money. I've even
gotten requests from a lot of users, like, for instance,
143

144
00:09:54.280 --> 00:10:00.280
we did a post on a hydrofoil, which is like a surfboard
kind of that you stand on it, but you're kind
144

145
00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.980
of floating in the air.
145

146
00:10:02.020 --> 00:10:03.980
I don't know, you can see it in a video.
146

147
00:10:04.480 --> 00:10:08.540
And I've had at least five or six people
ask me where they can buy that.
147

148
00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:13.540
So it'd pretty easy for me to then go to that company
and be like, "Hey, we featured your thing, it had
148

149
00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:15.460
several people interested in buying,
149

150
00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.900
would you like to do a paid promotion?"
150

151
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.220
That's a pretty easy sell.
151

152
00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:21.900
Now, here's my take on the inbound versus
outbound. Inbound is kind of a no brainer,
152

153
00:10:21.940 --> 00:10:24.330
it doesn't really take anything from you,
153

154
00:10:24.330 --> 00:10:29.050
it's not, if you do it well, do it tactfully, it's not going
to detract from your account or lower your
154

155
00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.000
conversion rate for people hitting your page,
155

156
00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.080
so you might as well do it.
156

157
00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:33.450
Just be careful with your wording so
157

158
00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:37.550
you don't sound like "Hey, this account's
for sale." Now, with outbound,
158

159
00:10:37.570 --> 00:10:44.140
I generally say that you should just wait until you're
at least, say, 50,000 or 100,000 followers to do that,
159

160
00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:44.790
I generally say that you should just wait until you're
at least, say, 50,000 or 100,000 followers to do that,
160

161
00:10:44.810 --> 00:10:48.580
and the reason why is because if you're too small,
you're just wasting your time, you're not going to
161

162
00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.690
get a lot of responses from people, because it's just
not worth their time to set up an arrangement for
162

163
00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:55.460
an ad if you only have 10,000 followers.
163

164
00:10:55.480 --> 00:10:59.540
Especially when you start reaching out to Kickstarters
or companies, I don't know, let's say you sell crafts and
164

165
00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:01.660
you're going on Etsy and messaging people,
165

166
00:11:01.660 --> 00:11:06.110
it's really going to be hard for people
to care if you're a small account.
166

167
00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:11.380
So I generally say wait till you're larger. If I have 5,000
followers, it'd be very hard to get anyone to pay me,
167

168
00:11:11.380 --> 00:11:11.820
So I generally say wait till you're larger. If I have 5,000
followers, it'd be very hard to get anyone to pay me,
168

169
00:11:11.830 --> 00:11:16.720
but if I had a million, it'd be pretty dang easy to go to someone
and say "For $500 bucks, I'll get this in front of a million people."
169

170
00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.620
but if I had a million, it'd be pretty dang easy to go to someone
and say "For $500 bucks, I'll get this in front of a million people."
170

171
00:11:17.650 --> 00:11:21.610
So that's the first thing you have to decide. Are
you going to open up your accounts to inquiries?
171

172
00:11:21.610 --> 00:11:23.590
Personally, my take is, why not?
172

173
00:11:23.590 --> 00:11:27.970
It's not going to really cost you anything, as long as you
put some thought into that one line that you use.
173

174
00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:32.800
Second question is, are you going to do outbound? And
then the question is, how big is your account, and how
174

175
00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:35.230
much time do you want to put into this?
175

176
00:11:35.230 --> 00:11:39.670
All right, so the next thing you want to do if this is
the strategy you want to pursue, is you want to
176

177
00:11:39.670 --> 00:11:42.540
build a price list and you want to build some instructions.
177

178
00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:45.090
So we're going to tackle that in the next lecture.
178

179
00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.850
So see you then.
