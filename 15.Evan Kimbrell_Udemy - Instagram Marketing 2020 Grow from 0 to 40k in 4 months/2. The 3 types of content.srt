Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,590 --> 00:00:06,640
All right, so in this lecture we're going to talk about the
three main types of content that's on Instagram.
2

3
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,970
Now, if you ever used Instagram, you can probably
guess what we're talking about. First type it's the good
3

4
00:00:11,970 --> 00:00:14,670
old fashioned images and that's what they started with.
4

5
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:23,700
The second we have is video, relatively new, and the
third one is what they call stories - and yes, there
5

6
00:00:23,700 --> 00:00:27,270
are two other types, but they're kind of minor,
6

7
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:28,890
and we'll get to those later.
7

8
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:34,030
Specifically, I'm talking about boomerangs,
which I kind of consider a subset of photos,
8

9
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:39,710
and then you have live, which is very similar
to Facebook live, except it's on Instagram.
9

10
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,310
Really no difference there.
10

11
00:00:41,310 --> 00:00:44,920
So, first of all, everyone knows what
I mean when I say photos or images.
11

12
00:00:45,020 --> 00:00:50,310
This is how Instagram started and it's the backbone of
their system, and it's what people are most used to.
12

13
00:00:50,310 --> 00:00:56,610
It wasn't actually until 2013, I think, that Instagram added
another type of media other than photos, which
13

14
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:02,070
was videos. Now, images are relatively straightforward and they're easy to create and store. When you're creating content,
14

15
00:01:02,070 --> 00:01:02,590
was videos. Now, images are relatively straightforward and they're easy to create and store. When you're creating content,
15

16
00:01:02,580 --> 00:01:08,970
photos typically have a better shelf life, as in they stay
relevant, can be reused, and get engagement
16

17
00:01:08,970 --> 00:01:11,280
longer after you first made them.
17

18
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,620
We have a lot of tools for making these. In this course
specifically we're going to use tools like Canva,
18

19
00:01:16,620 --> 00:01:23,080
Photoshop, then we're going to use a tool by Buffer called 
Pablo, as well as there's some mobile apps that let you
19

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,210
make images on the go, if that's your thing.
20

21
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:30,750
It's also worth noting the vast majority of
accounts are actually just images only,
21

22
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,840
and that's just because in general they're way easier
to make. Video requires a little more know-how
22

23
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,850
and it might include some nice equipment if you're going
to be filming your own stuff. When you get tired of images,
23

24
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:42,390
and it might include some nice equipment if you're going
to be filming your own stuff. When you get tired of images,
24

25
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:49,230
we have our second media type, which are videos. Now,
videos on Instagram look just like an image, but they
25

26
00:01:49,230 --> 00:01:56,410
have the little, kind of like a play button,
but it's a camera icon, up in the top right,
26

27
00:01:56,640 --> 00:02:01,980
and they only last maximum 60 seconds,
although there are some workarounds,
27

28
00:02:01,980 --> 00:02:07,920
if you really want to get them longer. Unlike Facebook
video though, when you're on the profile page at
28

29
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:13,710
least and you scroll, these don't auto play, which means,
thank God, when you get a view you know it's an
29

30
00:02:13,710 --> 00:02:16,700
actual view from a human and not a scrolling zombie.
30

31
00:02:16,710 --> 00:02:20,730
Now, the 60 second rule with video is
a blessing and at same time it's a curse.
31

32
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:25,520
When you limit yourself in time, it can be easier for
you to produce enough content to keep your feed
32

33
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:27,290
fresh and moving along,
33

34
00:02:27,330 --> 00:02:31,420
and also, hey, it used to be 15 seconds,
so at least count your blessings there.
34

35
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,170
But 60 seconds can be frustrating if you're trying to, say, show clips of an interview or something a little more substantial.
35

36
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,090
But 60 seconds can be frustrating if you're trying to, say, show clips of an interview or something a little more substantial.
36

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,540
Instagram generally though is not
the place for that kind of stuff
37

38
00:02:42,570 --> 00:02:49,140
anyway, it's designed for quick consumption, it's not nearly
as bad as Twitter but it's not Medium or Quora.
38

39
00:02:49,140 --> 00:02:50,080
anyway, it's designed for quick consumption, it's not nearly
as bad as Twitter but it's not Medium or Quora.
39

40
00:02:50,270 --> 00:02:57,100
The last type of content you need to concern yourself
with are stories. Now, stories are, I guess, relatively new.
40

41
00:02:57,390 --> 00:03:05,280
I think Instagram added them in August of 2016, and
they're a really original and innovative way to completely
41

42
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:07,810
copy Snapchat without even trying.
42

43
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,570
No, but seriously, this was a thing that Snapchat first
came out with, the idea was that you could stitch
43

44
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:17,520
together photos and videos that you're taking throughout
the day and then present those publicly to your
44

45
00:03:17,520 --> 00:03:21,020
friends, and you didn't have to send
them to anybody, like on Snapchat,
45

46
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:26,250
you could just view them at your own leisure. And Instagram basically saw that, they're like, "Well, that's nice.
46

47
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:26,490
you could just view them at your own leisure. And Instagram basically saw that, they're like, "Well, that's nice.
47

48
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:27,520
We'll just do that."
48

49
00:03:27,660 --> 00:03:32,880
And now we have stories, which admittedly
were actually a pretty good addition to Instagram.
49

50
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:35,180
They're actually more successful on
Instagram than they were on Snapchat.
50

51
00:03:35,250 --> 00:03:38,050
So how should we think about the
three options that we have here?
51

52
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:41,700
Well, the idea is that you should
plan this kind of like a diet.
52

53
00:03:41,700 --> 00:03:45,360
How much video should you have versus images or stories?
53

54
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,120
If you look at big advertisers and big accounts, let's
look at National Geographic, or ESPN, or even
54

55
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,650
BuzzFeed, you'll notice that they
have a similar posting pattern.
55

56
00:03:55,650 --> 00:04:00,480
Usually it's like a 2:1 ratio, you usually
see two images per one video.
56

57
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,780
Now, some might be completely different,
depending on what they're going for.
57

58
00:04:04,800 --> 00:04:10,980
Like, The New Yorker is about 8:1 images to video,
they're a written magazine, whereas Tasty,
58

59
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,160
you know, that site that makes those really
addicting recipe videos, part of BuzzFeed I think,
59

60
00:04:15,330 --> 00:04:17,570
well, they're going have a lot more videos.
60

61
00:04:17,570 --> 00:04:20,020
They have 9:1 videos to images.
61

62
00:04:20,040 --> 00:04:26,430
Now, what does planning for differentiation matter? Because, well, engagement. I'm going to say that a lot - because engagement.
62

63
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:31,080
Engagement is the number of likes, views,
and comments on each post you make.
63

64
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:34,080
Engagement has a profound snowball effect.
64

65
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,270
If you use more engaging media, you'll get more engagement, which tells Instagram's algorithm to bump you
65

66
00:04:39,270 --> 00:04:41,080
up, and then the cycle continues.
66

67
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:46,440
Now, it used to be the case that Instagram would promote posts generally just based on the engagement on the singular post,
67

68
00:04:46,500 --> 00:04:47,970
Now, it used to be the case that Instagram would promote posts generally just based on the engagement on the singular post,
68

69
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:53,040
but recently they shifted to promoting posts by virtue
of the average engagement of the account as a whole,
69

70
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,030
but recently they shifted to promoting posts by virtue
of the average engagement of the account as a whole,
70

71
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,970
plus a little bit of the photo.
71

72
00:04:55,980 --> 00:05:01,780
So if you want to benefit from this, then you need to keep what you're doing fresh. While it's completely counter-intuitive,
72

73
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,440
be aware that different media gets treated differently.
73

74
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:10,980
Videos actually get watched 40% more just
because, hey, it's a video, let's try it out,
74

75
00:05:10,990 --> 00:05:13,600
and that's kind of a strong impulse
whenever you're scrolling.
75

76
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,590
But images get 37% more likes.
76

77
00:05:17,590 --> 00:05:22,600
Now, why is that? Well, probably because people don't
finish videos, and the call to action in the video to
77

78
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,830
get them to engage is often lost on the user or
lost in the video, because they quit too early.
78

79
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:29,360
So what does that mean for you?
79

80
00:05:29,500 --> 00:05:35,650
Well, when we get to videos, we're going to focus on
videos that are shorter and thus stimulate the attention
80

81
00:05:35,650 --> 00:05:39,430
span that you're more likely to see on a photo.
81

82
00:05:39,420 --> 00:05:41,250
The goldfish attention span.
82

83
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:43,050
What about stories though?
83

84
00:05:43,180 --> 00:05:47,770
How does the use of stories, for instance,
mix with the other two types?
84

85
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:54,700
For those of you that are new to this, they show up at
the top of your search, your feed, and your... God,
85

86
00:05:54,700 --> 00:05:57,220
I swear, it's pretty much everything,
they're trying to put them in
86

87
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,370
everywhere you go. They only show up
though for people that already follow you,
87

88
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:05,360
so they aren't used directly to get
new followers and grow your account.
88

89
00:06:05,380 --> 00:06:07,440
So if they don't grow your account exactly,
89

90
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:08,120
So if they don't grow your account exactly,
90

91
00:06:08,120 --> 00:06:10,160
then why do we still use them?
91

92
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:11,880
The answer is yes, of course,
92

93
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:19,360
I mean, they don't directly grow it, but they do indirectly
grow your account. Stories solicit engagement
93

94
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,100
from your follower base, which increases the
likelihood that they go and then look at other stuff
94

95
00:06:24,130 --> 00:06:26,940
on your profile and become regulars on your posts.
95

96
00:06:27,100 --> 00:06:32,110
That essentially rubs the Instagram algorithm in
the belly, which is where it likes it, and voila, you
96

97
00:06:32,110 --> 00:06:33,490
suddenly get more attention.
97

98
00:06:33,490 --> 00:06:35,980
The key here is that the variety is the spice of life.
98

99
00:06:35,980 --> 00:06:39,090
Try not to be an account that only does one type or the other.
99

100
00:06:39,160 --> 00:06:43,750
The more you mix it up, the more people will engage with
the account, the more your account gets promoted.
100

101
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:45,570
It's just a happy little cycle.
101

102
00:06:45,640 --> 00:06:48,940
So think to yourself, how much time and
investment are you putting into this?
102

103
00:06:48,940 --> 00:06:54,580
If you can and are willing to try some stuff out,
then videos will really help your account grow.
103

104
00:06:54,580 --> 00:06:58,690
Now, they don't have to be professionally shot, and
to be honest, you can just stitch together photos that
104

105
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:05,650
you have with animations to make videos, or you can even borrow video from other accounts or elsewhere, like YouTube.
105

106
00:07:05,650 --> 00:07:06,410
you have with animations to make videos, or you can even borrow video from other accounts or elsewhere, like YouTube.
106

107
00:07:06,430 --> 00:07:10,710
These are all things we're going to show you in
this course. Now, stories aren't worth ignoring,
107

108
00:07:10,780 --> 00:07:15,490
but they do take a little more know-how to pull off
correctly, so it's generally something I suggest
108

109
00:07:15,490 --> 00:07:17,730
you keep in the back of your head,
109

110
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:22,900
watch some stories from your favorite accounts to see
what exactly they do, and know that we'll kind of
110

111
00:07:22,900 --> 00:07:27,730
circle back to them later on in the course, when we're
a little bit more advanced, especially when we're
111

112
00:07:27,730 --> 00:07:29,680
assuming that you actually have some followers.
112

113
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,370
All right, guys, that's it. We're going to
be moving on to the next lecture.
113

114
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:34,670
Comments, questions, post in the Slack.
114

115
00:07:34,850 --> 00:07:35,110
Peace out.
