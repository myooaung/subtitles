Hey guys welcome back ok new section new growth strategy what we're going to talk about in this section

2
00:00:05.880 --> 00:00:07.550
are what are called bots.

3
00:00:07.560 --> 00:00:12.840
Now if you already know what that is and you just had some physical reaction that was really negative

4
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:20.250
then I strongly suggest that you skip this section because bots are kind of controversial but they are

5
00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.000
everywhere.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.740
Love them or hate them they are a legitimate way that accounts grow.

7
00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:30.620
And I honestly cannot find an account online that's doing well.

8
00:00:30.630 --> 00:00:33.220
I don't think he's using a bot.

9
00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.610
You notice in the previous lectures when we talked about mass followers sometimes when you look at reports

10
00:00:38.640 --> 00:00:43.590
of people's accounts of things that are called mass followers now that could be someone who actually

11
00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:48.060
does go and just click click click click click follow to a lot of people essentially doing what we were

12
00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:49.020
doing.

13
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.090
Usually just says that a mass follower is someone who follows more than the average time say three if

14
00:00:55.090 --> 00:01:01.290
the average to 50 and over 750 would be a mass follower because you can't possibly follow 750 people

15
00:01:01.290 --> 00:01:03.840
if you're actually using this for personal consumption.

16
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:06.550
But Nasrallah has also come from bottes.

17
00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:11.870
So essentially what bots are it's an application that you run.

18
00:01:11.910 --> 00:01:17.550
And what it does is it'll go based on some targeting and finds some people who fit who you think is

19
00:01:17.550 --> 00:01:20.840
your target market or follow say like your competitor.

20
00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.640
And then it follows them and it does like for them.

21
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.730
It basically does exactly what we did in the habit schedule lecture.

22
00:01:27.720 --> 00:01:31.540
Remember before we are setting this list of things we should do where we go.

23
00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:36.080
Follow like like follow and then go through and do a certain amount every day.

24
00:01:36.090 --> 00:01:42.330
Well that's exactly what a bot does for you but it does it to a much greater extent.

25
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:44.430
And it does that without you having to do anything.

26
00:01:44.430 --> 00:01:49.180
So the general rule is that Instagram allows 400 interactions per day per account.

27
00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:53.040
Now when you're listening to this this could have totally changed because they do changes frequently

28
00:01:53.600 --> 00:02:01.060
400 interactions just means that any given day I can like comment or follow a maximum of 400 times.

29
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:05.730
Anything over that they're going to say OK this is probably a spam account.

30
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:09.140
So pretty much all bots are going to keep you underneath that threshold.

31
00:02:09.150 --> 00:02:13.110
If you're doing it manually Tanso you're never going to you're going to get even close to that.

32
00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.860
So that's sort of does.

33
00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:20.520
It just runs follows and brings them in and the quality of a bot kind of varies wildly.

34
00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:25.260
There are some ones out there that really flirt with that 400 line way too much and it's something we

35
00:02:25.260 --> 00:02:26.690
don't want to do period.

36
00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:31.160
And then there are ones out there that are big companies actually who run them.

37
00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:35.290
They're really polished they have a lot of features and they cost a lot of money.

38
00:02:35.310 --> 00:02:38.500
The one thing they have in common though is that they all work a certain way.

39
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:38.820
OK.

40
00:02:38.820 --> 00:02:40.890
So they'll imitate your interaction.

41
00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:47.340
So usually what happens is you either tell it I want to follow and comment and interact with everybody

42
00:02:47.340 --> 00:02:52.000
who is looking at or commenting or following this hashtag.

43
00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.560
OK that's one way of doing it.

44
00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:56.930
Do you really think your audience just hangs out on hash tag.

45
00:02:56.940 --> 00:02:58.760
That's a great way of doing bots.

46
00:02:58.770 --> 00:03:03.330
They always do competitors so if you think there is a competitor who is exactly the type of people you

47
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:07.920
want well then you can use a bot for that then what it does it just goes to the competitor and looks

48
00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:13.350
at all their followers and just item like one by one goes by and interacts with them brings attention

49
00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:14.040
to your account.

50
00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:16.470
Now there is some optional things that some bots do.

51
00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:20.090
So for instance some of them will do mass on following for you.

52
00:03:20.110 --> 00:03:22.130
Lindsey Graham recently made this harder.

53
00:03:22.290 --> 00:03:27.000
But essentially what that is is after you follow a bunch of people if they don't follow you back that's

54
00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:27.960
one way of doing it.

55
00:03:27.990 --> 00:03:30.620
You unfollow them or you just unfollow all of them.

56
00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:35.490
If you don't do that what ends up happening is you see these accounts a lot where someone will be following

57
00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.910
25000 people and have 30000 followers.

58
00:03:38.940 --> 00:03:43.540
So you ask how is it that they're sitting there pressing is 25000 times because they use the bot.

59
00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.570
And they don't do and follows.

60
00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:52.590
Generally speaking it just looks bad if your ratio of following to the word is that bad so it's like

61
00:03:52.590 --> 00:03:53.520
a one to one.

62
00:03:53.520 --> 00:03:54.880
That's kind of incredible.

63
00:03:54.930 --> 00:03:57.730
Or if you're following more people involve you.

64
00:03:57.740 --> 00:03:59.840
That's a great red flag for an account.

65
00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.630
So it's up to you if you want to do mass follows.

66
00:04:02.700 --> 00:04:05.850
I generally do it but I usually do it manually.

67
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:09.930
Now though one thing I'll mention is that some of them will do comment automations that I should go

68
00:04:09.930 --> 00:04:12.890
to people's accounts look at a photo and then comment.

69
00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:17.340
Now comments bring in a lot of engagement for you and it's a great way of getting people to follow your

70
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:17.780
account.

71
00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.010
But bots do these to varying degrees of accuracy.

72
00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:27.420
My general suggestion is don't ever use it for commenting because bots are just terrible at this.

73
00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:32.340
To be honest I mean the worst one I ever saw was someone using a bot and it went to someone's photo

74
00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:38.490
and has a photo of their son in a bathing suit and he was like four or five years old and it commented

75
00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.850
nice.

76
00:04:40.020 --> 00:04:45.120
You know I'm saying they build these pots to call it really simple things like love it.

77
00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.160
Great.

78
00:04:46.170 --> 00:04:47.640
Nice.

79
00:04:47.640 --> 00:04:51.650
Who would have thought things like that that could apply to a lot of different posts.

80
00:04:51.810 --> 00:04:57.780
But it's really just kind of screwy and it's not really something that I want to deal with so I generally

81
00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:58.500
don't do that.

82
00:04:58.610 --> 00:05:04.110
Guys in the next Dr. explore some of the more prominent bought companies out there and we can make a

83
00:05:04.110 --> 00:05:09.540
pick about which one we're going to use again if you guys are not comfortable with black hat strategies

84
00:05:09.540 --> 00:05:11.530
for growth perfectly fine.

85
00:05:11.530 --> 00:05:12.360
That is up to you.

86
00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.500
I'm venturing into it just so I can show you guys what options are out there.

87
00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:21.090
There are plenty of ways to grow your account naturally through things like shout outs by using the

88
00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:24.530
right hashtags by doing things we'll cover later like competitions.

89
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:26.690
So don't fret just skip it.

90
00:05:26.730 --> 00:05:29.930
Not gonna hurt my feelings and I'll see the rest of you in the next picture.
