Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:11.510
This lecture, what we're going to do is we're going to talk
about your habit schedule going forward with Instagram.
2

3
00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:17.070
Now, and again, this is something I suggest you do,
but like something you're prescribed by your doctor,
3

4
00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.740
you don't have to take it,
4

5
00:00:18.770 --> 00:00:20.920
I just would prefer if you were less dead.
5

6
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:26.660
Now, what I suggest in this section is that we're going to focus
on some manual things that you can get in the habit of doing,
6

7
00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:27.390
Now, what I suggest in this section is that we're going to focus
on some manual things that you can get in the habit of doing,
7

8
00:00:27.650 --> 00:00:34.060
and for the first two weeks or so of your account, these
will contribute significantly to your account's growth.
8

9
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:34.890
and for the first two weeks or so of your account, these
will contribute significantly to your account's growth.
9

10
00:00:34.910 --> 00:00:41.000
It's really important when you first start out to get the
hang of the space you're in, what your competitors
10

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.680
are doing, what your users look like, what they post,
what they like, and to just get out there and actually
11

12
00:00:48.680 --> 00:00:50.050
get used to the platform.
12

13
00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:55.660
If you're someone who thinks you're an advanced Instagram user, but you're still taking a $10 online course... whatever,
13

14
00:00:55.670 --> 00:00:56.910
go to the next section, that's perfectly fine.
14

15
00:00:56.930 --> 00:00:58.270
go to the next section, that's perfectly fine.
15

16
00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:01.590
Are we going to focus on more automated
ways of growing your account?
16

17
00:01:01.730 --> 00:01:06.780
Yes, of course we are, but I think this is worth doing
and it takes 10 minutes, so just suck it up.
17

18
00:01:06.830 --> 00:01:13.370
So what I suggest you do is every day you set a schedule
of getting on your account and, regardless of
18

19
00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:14.960
when you're posting,
19

20
00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.800
going in and following people's accounts, liking
people's photos, and commenting on their posts.
20

21
00:01:19.030 --> 00:01:21.920
going in and following people's accounts, liking
people's photos, and commenting on their posts.
21

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:28.370
What this will allow you to do is notify every single
person that you interact with and in something like
22

23
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.960
30% to 40% of the time that you do that,
someone will then follow you back.
23

24
00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:33.570
30% to 40% of the time that you do that,
someone will then follow you back.
24

25
00:01:33.570 --> 00:01:37.180
So it's a great way to get your first
handful of followers, those are
25

26
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:39.520
people who are going to like your
stuff, comment on your stuff, and
26

27
00:01:39.620 --> 00:01:42.500
that's going to increase the exposure of your posts.
27

28
00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.620
And yes, there are bots that do
this and they do it very well,
28

29
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:52.130
but we're going to cover that in the next
section coming up, so we'll do that later,
29

30
00:01:52.130 --> 00:01:58.890
this is I think more useful because you can't learn as much from a bot, and also bots do some really weird things when they comment on people's photos.
30

31
00:01:59.350 --> 00:01:59.960
this is I think more useful because you can't learn as much from a bot, and also bots do some really weird things when they comment on people's photos.
31

32
00:01:59.960 --> 00:02:01.330
So that's the beauty of Instagram.
32

33
00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:06.730
Every time I follow you, you get a notification in the
notifications section saying, "This person followed you,"
33

34
00:02:06.890 --> 00:02:12.500
and most times people will then go look at your profile,
and very often they will follow you back, especially
34

35
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:13.580
if you targeted them well.
35

36
00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.110
If you follow them and then you comment on one of their posts
or you like some of their posts, they get multiple messages,
36

37
00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:21.560
so they're even more likely to do it.
37

38
00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.660
So the way I suggest doing it is pretty
simple. Just go to your Instagram.
38

39
00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:33.380
Now, what you should do is pull up one of your direct
competitors from one of the sheets that we made before
39

40
00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:35.560
So I'll check out mine.
40

41
00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:42.370
So for me I'm going to pick, we'll check Futurism Gadgets.
41

42
00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:47.990
I think that might be somewhat useful, I'm going to
pick someone who posts very similar stuff to me.
42

43
00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:48.600
OK.
43

44
00:02:48.710 --> 00:02:51.830
So we'll go to Futurism Gadgets. Now, the
goal here is not to follow the big account,
44

45
00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:58.870
So we'll go to Futurism Gadgets. Now, the
goal here is not to follow the big account,
45

46
00:02:58.940 --> 00:03:00.230
we don't care about that.
46

47
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:03.040
The odds of them following you back are very slim.
47

48
00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:08.370
What we want to do is look at their followers, because
those people already self-selected themselves that
48

49
00:03:08.430 --> 00:03:14.930
they're interested in futurism gadgets, that is similar enough
to what I'm doing, innovation posts, that this makes
49

50
00:03:14.930 --> 00:03:22.410
sense. So then what you generally want to do is just go to one of their posts and you can look at the people who commented.
50

51
00:03:22.430 --> 00:03:28.490
Those people are usually really engaged with this topic,
they really care, or if you're just lazy, you just go over
51

52
00:03:28.490 --> 00:03:31.760
here to their followers list, and that's it, right there.
52

53
00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:39.360
Now, all of these people are interested in futurism gadgets,
so I can just interact with these and it's very easy.
53

54
00:03:39.610 --> 00:03:44.600
What I think you should do just for a couple seconds is
just verify that the people who are following this match
54

55
00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:53.270
your general idea of a profile for your users. Now, we
had a resource activity before, we talked about making
55

56
00:03:53.270 --> 00:04:00.230
user personas, but all I really care about is that maybe they're a college student, a business student, maybe they're someone
56

57
00:04:00.230 --> 00:04:02.980
who works at a company in tech.
57

58
00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.500
I don't know, there's a lot of different things that I could go for.
58

59
00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:08.650
So let's just try out a couple of random ones.
59

60
00:04:08.750 --> 00:04:09.500
OK.
60

61
00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:16.210
This guy says he's ambitious, he's aspiring, he's a mechanical engineer, entrepreneur, innovator, actor, ok, so those are all things
61

62
00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:22.760
that hit on possible people that I would want to follow
me, ambitious, aspiring, it's good for innovation,
62

63
00:04:22.910 --> 00:04:25.760
he's an entrepreneur, that's exactly the group we're
going after, he thinks he's an innovator, that's cool.
63

64
00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:26.800
he's an entrepreneur, that's exactly the group we're
going after, he thinks he's an innovator, that's cool.
64

65
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.310
OK.
65

66
00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:32.110
So I would do this with a couple more, just to make sure
that these are the right people that I'm targeting,
66

67
00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:34.750
that's not that I've completely misunderstood this account,
67

68
00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:38.220
and then what I would do is just then try three things.
68

69
00:04:38.230 --> 00:04:46.400
One, I'd follow them. Two, after I follow them, I'd go to their account, I'd probably like a couple of their posts, and if I really
69

70
00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:51.380
think they hit the spot, I might comment on
some of their posts. Okay, in a later lecture,
70

71
00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:54.350
I'll actually do it with Innovation Station,
71

72
00:04:54.420 --> 00:04:57.990
but I'm just kind of showing you
the quick and dirty way of doing it.
72

73
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.880
Honestly, doing this will take 10 minutes of your day.
73

74
00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:03.940
It's incredibly easy to do while you're in an
74

75
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:08.180
Uber, or you're sitting at a doctor's office, while
you're laying in bed not being able to sleep,
75

76
00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:11.480
whatever. Now, everybody has a
different schedule for how they do this.
76

77
00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:18.140
Some people say you follow someone, you like five of
their photos, and you comment on two, some people say
77

78
00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:19.640
just follow people, that's it, and
you just like photos in your feed.
78

79
00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:21.640
just follow people, that's it, and
you just like photos in your feed.
79

80
00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:23.370
I don't generally like to do that.
80

81
00:05:23.380 --> 00:05:26.380
I like to do what's called a triple tap, so you just follow them,
81

82
00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:31.190
you go into their account, then you find two
of their images, and then you like them.
82

83
00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:31.870
OK.
83

84
00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.210
That's it.
84

85
00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.170
You can add a comment if you want to, I think it's overkill.
85

86
00:05:36.170 --> 00:05:38.660
I just like it that you can do three taps and you're done.
86

87
00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:42.900
So here is an example of one that you could follow.
87

88
00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:49.520
So if you were someone who wanted to focus on
just light growth, this is like 10 minutes a day, you're
88

89
00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:52.810
going to do this first thing in the morning, whatever, and
89

90
00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:54.650
you really only want to take 10-15 minutes,
that's it, the absolute bare minimum,
90

91
00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:55.500
you really only want to take 10-15 minutes,
that's it, the absolute bare minimum,
91

92
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:57.100
you really only want to take 10-15 minutes,
that's it, the absolute bare minimum,
92

93
00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.670
this is a pretty good schedule. So what I would
suggest you do is shoot for three posts a day.
93

94
00:06:01.670 --> 00:06:06.410
This, I wrote your best times, 6 PM, 10 PM, 2 AM, just as reminders, because remember, we don't have a lot of data
94

95
00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:08.270
on our audience yet.
95

96
00:06:08.330 --> 00:06:14.780
I would suggest following 50 people, doing the triple tap
thing I was talking about, picking 20 of those and then
96

97
00:06:14.910 --> 00:06:20.490
clicking two of their photos to like, this is incredibly easy
to do because if you have a list of followers, you can just go
97

98
00:06:20.770 --> 00:06:24.980
Follow, Follow, Follow x 50 and then
just pick 20 to go in and like two.
98

99
00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.770
And then the last thing is try to comment on five,
try to get an idea of what people are talking about,
99

100
00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.400
what posts work, and figuring out how
to communicate with these people,
100

101
00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.860
because they're going to be commenting on your posts,
101

102
00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:40.820
you need to figure out this type of language. Then what I
put down here is total interactions. Now, it's 95 because
102

103
00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:45.240
you do two double likes, so that's 40 plus 50 plus five.
103

104
00:06:45.320 --> 00:06:50.440
Now, why did I put the total interactions? One, to give you an
idea of how many things you have to do with your fingers,
104

105
00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:56.510
95 touches with your fingers, but also Instagram limits how
many interactions you can have per day on your account.
105

106
00:06:56.510 --> 00:06:57.120
95 touches with your fingers, but also Instagram limits how
many interactions you can have per day on your account.
106

107
00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:00.000
They limit that to 400. Anything over 400,
107

108
00:07:00.070 --> 00:07:05.750
and they're going to think that you're a robot that's trying to spam their system, so that's when you get in the danger zone,
108

109
00:07:05.810 --> 00:07:07.220
and they literally start shutting you down.
109

110
00:07:07.220 --> 00:07:10.000
So we don't want to get even close to that.
110

111
00:07:10.210 --> 00:07:11.090
That's why we shoot for 95.
111

112
00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:18.040
Now, let's say you wanted to be an average user, that's
maybe 25 minutes, 20 minutes, something like that, you're
112

113
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.960
actually enjoying using Instagram,
113

114
00:07:19.980 --> 00:07:23.070
I'd suggest posting six times, then I'd suggest
following 80, liking 30 and commenting on eight.
114

115
00:07:23.150 --> 00:07:25.300
I'd suggest posting six times, then I'd suggest
following 80, liking 30 and commenting on eight.
115

116
00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:27.850
That gives you a total of 148 interactions.
116

117
00:07:27.890 --> 00:07:29.030
I think that's perfectly fine.
117

118
00:07:29.030 --> 00:07:31.630
And again, do this over a two week cycle,
118

119
00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:33.510
you can do it seven if you're really lazy,
119

120
00:07:33.650 --> 00:07:39.900
but the point is to get into it. And just
from this, honestly, that's 148 x 14,
120

121
00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:47.630
that's 2000 interactions, and if you have 40% of people
following you, then that's easily like 800 followers.
121

122
00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:48.880
that's 2000 interactions, and if you have 40% of people
following you, then that's easily like 800 followers.
122

123
00:07:48.890 --> 00:07:52.280
I know that you overlap some,
but you kind of get the point.
123

124
00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:54.050
This doesn't take a long time.
124

125
00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:58.190
That's a very easy way to get your first thousand, five
hundred followers. The the last thing I put is aggressive,
125

126
00:07:58.450 --> 00:07:59.430
That's a very easy way to get your first thousand, five
hundred followers. The the last thing I put is aggressive,
126

127
00:07:59.570 --> 00:08:04.520
this is great if you're someone who's just obsessed with
this, this is a big thing that you're going to use as a
127

128
00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.860
growth channel for your business, and
you are fine giving it an hour a day.
128

129
00:08:08.870 --> 00:08:15.080
So I just put follow 150, like 50, and comment 20, that puts you at 270, so you're comfortably underneath that cap before you get in
129

130
00:08:15.080 --> 00:08:21.150
the danger zone. I'll put a link to this in the resources if
you want to use this template, it's pretty dang simple.
130

131
00:08:21.170 --> 00:08:27.080
Now, another way you can do this, and here are two ways
that I like to do it, and it makes it incredibly useful
131

132
00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:33.680
for me, if you've ever used the app Todoist, it's a
to do list app, and it works on Mac and Windows, so
132

133
00:08:33.890 --> 00:08:34.890
don't worry about that.
133

134
00:08:35.050 --> 00:08:37.000
If you have it, it looks like this.
134

135
00:08:37.040 --> 00:08:37.890
OK.
135

136
00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:45.520
It's an incredibly useful tool to use, because you can make to do lists, but also you can share them with people and turn them
136

137
00:08:45.530 --> 00:08:53.240
into collaborative spaces, and you can type in very quickly
what you need and speak in everyday language.
137

138
00:08:53.270 --> 00:08:54.800
So that's why it's incredibly useful.
138

139
00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:02.770
So what I do on Todoist is I just make a project
over here and I'll put Innovation Station and I
139

140
00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:06.080
might do multiple lists when I'm doing multiple
accounts. So there we go, Innovation Station.
140

141
00:09:06.150 --> 00:09:15.670
Now, what I do is add a task and I can
put 50 likes or 50 follows every day.
141

142
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:23.950
So notice how when I put every day like that, it turns into
that calendar, so what does is every, if I submitted this,
142

143
00:09:24.050 --> 00:09:29.540
every single day I'll get a push notification on my
computer, on my phone, telling me I need
143

144
00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:32.870
to do these follows, and if I don't do it,
it's going to keep showing up,
144

145
00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:38.840
so I have to click through it to finish it. And then if I want to
pick the time, so I get up at 8:00 AM, so let's say 8:00 AM.
145

146
00:09:38.880 --> 00:09:42.590
Every single day at 8:00 AM it will
pop up and say, "Hey, please do this."
146

147
00:09:42.740 --> 00:09:53.740
So I could do these 50 follows like that, and then
I could do, say, my 20 double likes every day,
147

148
00:09:54.020 --> 00:10:00.050
and then my five comments every day at 8:00 AM. Cool.
148

149
00:10:00.070 --> 00:10:06.140
OK, so that's a great way of reminding yourself to do it,
it's also an incredibly useful tool for other things.
149

150
00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:13.910
Now, one other way you can do it is an app called Motivation,
and Motivation is an app that uses the concept of
150

151
00:10:13.910 --> 00:10:17.350
breaking the chain to help you develop habits.
151

152
00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:23.300
So the idea is that you use it to track every single
day that you do something, and it looks visually
152

153
00:10:23.300 --> 00:10:28.030
glorious when you do it correctly, but when you don't
do it correctly it actually is quite demotivating.
153

154
00:10:28.030 --> 00:10:32.150
So on a Mac, it looks like this, and
it pops down from your toolbar.
154

155
00:10:32.250 --> 00:10:36.560
On a PC, it looks a little bit different, and on your
phone it looks a little bit different as well.
155

156
00:10:36.590 --> 00:10:41.750
So what you do is, it shows every single day of the
month that you're in and then you just add a habit.
156

157
00:10:41.750 --> 00:10:45.780
So if I said "Follow 50 people,"
157

158
00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:46.390
So if I said "Follow 50 people,"
158

159
00:10:46.450 --> 00:10:48.470
it's going to create a little bar right there.
159

160
00:10:48.470 --> 00:10:51.980
And then when I can do is go over here to
the three dots and I can set my settings.
160

161
00:10:52.010 --> 00:10:56.840
Now, if I want to do this every single day,
I just leave it repeat it every single day.
161

162
00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.390
I can put a reminder, same way as
with Todoist. If I don't care when I do it,
162

163
00:11:01.400 --> 00:11:03.630
but I only want to do it five days a week,
163

164
00:11:03.650 --> 00:11:04.800
I can do this.
164

165
00:11:04.850 --> 00:11:09.870
And so, what will happen is, as I click through it,
it'll adjust itself, so once I hit my five,
165

166
00:11:09.950 --> 00:11:13.040
it's ungray everything out, so you're good. Right here, it
166

167
00:11:13.050 --> 00:11:17.910
tells you current streak and your longest streak,
total completions, that's just purely for motivation.
167

168
00:11:17.910 --> 00:11:18.620
And it looks great.
168

169
00:11:18.620 --> 00:11:23.500
So if I add another one, let's say like 20,
169

170
00:11:23.870 --> 00:11:32.570
and then comment 5, every single day I'll get a notification
from all of these, and I can set the settings however I want,
170

171
00:11:32.630 --> 00:11:37.560
so I can go to today or here and let's say
I did them, I can just check them through.
171

172
00:11:37.820 --> 00:11:38.520
Right.
172

173
00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:39.670
Every single day that I do it, I check it, I check it, it looks great.
173

174
00:11:39.830 --> 00:11:40.630
Every single day that I do it, I check it, I check it, it looks great.
174

175
00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:41.610
Every single day that I do it, I check it, I check it, it looks great.
175

176
00:11:41.630 --> 00:11:41.820
If you screw up, it starts looking like crap, and this is
a good reminder, you really need to keep doing this.
176

177
00:11:41.870 --> 00:11:47.830
If you screw up, it starts looking like crap, and this is
a good reminder, you really need to keep doing this.
177

178
00:11:47.900 --> 00:11:49.030
That's a really simple tool.
178

179
00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:49.670
I like it just because, as a person who gets obsessed
with things, I get obsessed with the way it looks,
179

180
00:11:49.670 --> 00:11:53.810
I like it just because, as a person who gets obsessed
with things, I get obsessed with the way it looks,
180

181
00:11:53.820 --> 00:12:00.650
and so I really want to break my record, I want to get as
long of a streak as I can. Really, really easy ways to do it,
181

182
00:12:00.650 --> 00:12:06.110
I also suggest just checking out the habit schedule, this is something I suggest doing. In a follow-up lecture, you're going to
182

183
00:12:06.110 --> 00:12:10.610
watch me just do this really quickly just to show
you how it's done, and I'll talk through it.
183

184
00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:11.820
You can get a feeling for it.
184

185
00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:12.440
All right, next lecture we're going to talk about habits with
dummy accounts, how to use them properly. See you then!
185

186
00:12:12.450 --> 00:12:16.630
All right, next lecture we're going to talk about habits with
dummy accounts, how to use them properly. See you then!
186

187
00:12:16.680 --> 00:12:16.810
All right, next lecture we're going to talk about habits with
dummy accounts, how to use them properly. See you then!
