00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:01,600
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:05,820
OK so just a quick question that I've been getting from students wanted to pop in and kind of clear

3
00:00:05,820 --> 00:00:07,360
this up for you guys.

4
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:13,230
What is the difference in a VPN and a proxy and how is that relevant to creating Instagram accounts.

5
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:15,540
Do you guys know what a VPN or a proxy is.

6
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:16,480
See in the next lecture.

7
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:20,360
But those who don't well stick around.

8
00:00:20,370 --> 00:00:27,150
OK so there's two different types of IP addresses that you can buy what's called a proxy and one is

9
00:00:27,150 --> 00:00:31,770
called a VPN VPN stands for virtual private network.

10
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:34,810
And that definition doesn't really help you a ton.

11
00:00:34,830 --> 00:00:37,130
Basically there's only one difference between the two.

12
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:42,670
Now a proxy is just an IP address that you can use somewhere else.

13
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:48,780
If I have a proxy I can install that on my system and then route all of my traffic through a different

14
00:00:48,780 --> 00:00:50,930
server that has a different IP address.

15
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,870
And then when I interact with Web sites or even desktop applications those systems will think I'm coming

16
00:00:57,870 --> 00:00:59,530
from that location.

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:00,600
That's pretty much it.

18
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:02,910
Proxies are usually cheaper than DP ends.

19
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:07,910
Now VPN on the other hand does the same exact thing but it encrypts your traffic.

20
00:01:07,980 --> 00:01:14,490
Typically you see the paeans being used in for instance countries where they have a lot of censorship

21
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,430
or they block a lot of Web sites that you want to use the part of encrypting your traffic is just so

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:26,520
that you can have an extra layer of safety if you want to hide your information hide the information

23
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,440
you're sending or whatever.

24
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:33,390
There's a lot of different reasons why you might use a VPN people for instance in medicine use VPN because

25
00:01:33,390 --> 00:01:39,180
they just don't want someone intercepting their traffic through things like data sniffing and then pulling

26
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:43,830
confidential information a proxy on the other hand is for someone who doesn't really care about hiding

27
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:44,770
their information.

28
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:47,180
They just want to appear that they come from different location.

29
00:01:47,190 --> 00:01:51,770
Now I use proxies typically because I don't really have anything that I want to hide.

30
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,800
But in my case I use proxies for things like buying airplane tickets.

31
00:01:55,800 --> 00:01:56,860
Now why is that.

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:04,830
Well for whatever reason if you go to like Kayak.com or Skyscanner or whatever you use if you take an

33
00:02:04,830 --> 00:02:11,790
IP address from some other country that for whatever reason might have a lot of promotions going on

34
00:02:11,820 --> 00:02:16,550
or is just a lower income country a lot of times you can get cheaper flights.

35
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,810
You can also play this game with currencies where I use a proxy in a country that has a currency that's

36
00:02:21,810 --> 00:02:23,040
currently sliding.

37
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,940
And I can pay in that currency and the conversion rates.

38
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:26,930
Great.

39
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,860
That's what I personally use it for.

40
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,510
It's a weird kind of loophole but there's a lot of different use cases why you might use a proxy.

41
00:02:33,510 --> 00:02:35,670
Now which one should you pick for your Instagram.

42
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:41,880
Typically I just say use a proxy and the reason why I say this is because proxies are cheaper faster

43
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:45,580
because they don't have to do a lot of the encryption that might slow down your traffic.

44
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:49,570
And with the vpn the encryption actually might create problems.

45
00:02:49,570 --> 00:02:54,750
So if you're using Instagram for incense and they see your data it's coming and like the packets you're

46
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:57,000
sitting their servers are encrypted.

47
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,230
They might actually flag that and it might look weird to them.

48
00:03:01,230 --> 00:03:06,760
So generally I try to avoid the paeans and I try to stick with proxies hide my ass.

49
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:10,020
Each is a VPN so just keep that in mind.

50
00:03:10,020 --> 00:03:14,340
I'm not saying it won't work but I'm saying it's one more thing that you should keep in mind if you

51
00:03:14,340 --> 00:03:17,670
want to make sure your traffic looks as legitimate as possible.

52
00:03:17,670 --> 00:03:18,370
OK guys.

53
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,200
That being said any questions post in that Q&amp;A or in the slack.

54
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:27,340
Otherwise I'll see in the next lecture where we're going to jump back in and start creating some accounts.

55
00:03:27,390 --> 00:03:27,750
See the.
