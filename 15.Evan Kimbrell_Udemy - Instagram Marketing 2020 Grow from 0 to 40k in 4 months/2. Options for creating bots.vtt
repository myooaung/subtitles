Hi guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:07.460
So in this lecture we're going to look at some of the 
options out there for creating an Instagram bot.
2

3
00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:14.640
Now, there are a lot of them, I'm just going to say that upfront,
I wouldn't be surprised if there's 30 or 40 of them out there.
3

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:15.440
Now, there are a lot of them, I'm just going to say that upfront,
I wouldn't be surprised if there's 30 or 40 of them out there.
4

5
00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:17.640
They all kind of do the same thing,
5

6
00:00:17.700 --> 00:00:23.380
there's just a couple different tweaks 
and different features you might see.
6

7
00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:28.020
Remember I talked about the Venn diagram 
from hell with Instagram features?
7

8
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:32.490
Well, some of these bots will charge more because 
they let you do some of the features that we can do
8

9
00:00:32.490 --> 00:00:39.880
in like Iconosquare or Buffer or Latergram, and then
other ones just claim to be able to do the interactions,
9

10
00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:41.970
the follows and unfollows, faster.
10

11
00:00:41.970 --> 00:00:44.730
Now, whether or not that's actually true,
11

12
00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.310
I don't actually know, I don't think anybody really knows.
12

13
00:00:47.310 --> 00:00:49.020
My inclination is to say no.
13

14
00:00:49.020 --> 00:00:52.340
However, there are services out 
there that are more conservative.
14

15
00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:53.100
That is true.
15

16
00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:57.550
Some of them will actually say that 
"We don't do the max following,
16

17
00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.320
we try to keep it in the safe zone."
17

18
00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:03.440
So that's kind of up to you, it just really 
depends on your risk tolerance.
18

19
00:01:03.450 --> 00:01:04.830
Are you gonna get banned for using these?
19

20
00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:11.040
No, because seriously, 60-80% of influencers 
on Instagram use these things.
20

21
00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:15.540
Now, there used to be a tool called Mass Planner, and
that was the most popular, that eventually got banned
21

22
00:01:15.570 --> 00:01:21.510
because they just got a little too aggressive with how
they were following and unfollowing and doing
22

23
00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:23.040
all their interactions.
23

24
00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:28.230
That was a weird kind of program that ran on your 
desktop, and you could clone it and do all sorts of
24

25
00:01:28.230 --> 00:01:29.520
this crazy stuff to it.
25

26
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:32.210
So that's a thing of the past.
26

27
00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:39.660
Now, for us, we need to look at what is still out there,
and so I'm going to start with Instavast. Now, Instavast,
27

28
00:01:39.670 --> 00:01:41.060
Now, for us, we need to look at what is still out there,
and so I'm going to start with Instavast. Now, Instavast,
28

29
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:43.980
it's common, it's well-known, people use it,
29

30
00:01:43.980 --> 00:01:45.800
it's very easy to use,
30

31
00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:51.150
and the biggest point I'm going to point out with 
these guys is that they're probably the cheapest. I
31

32
00:01:51.150 --> 00:01:56.520
think there's a couple places that are similar, but 
they only charge you $10/month per account, and
32

33
00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:00.680
that is pretty much the baseline. Then they 
want to charge you more for other things,
33

34
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.890
but those are things that you can get in Iconosquare
if you want, even I think Buffer has added a lot of
34

35
00:02:07.890 --> 00:02:10.710
these, like the comment tracking. 
For the most part, it's pretty simple.
35

36
00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:12.070
these, like the comment tracking. 
For the most part, it's pretty simple.
36

37
00:02:12.070 --> 00:02:16.860
You know, it has the ability to do things like comments,
and it's up to you if you want to do that, it has
37

38
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.920
the ability to track hashtags and competitors.
38

39
00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:24.600
You're going to hear me say this over and over again,
because they all kind of have the same thing.
39

40
00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:27.580
One thing that's nice about them is 
you don't have to download them.
40

41
00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:29.550
That is actually common with some of these.
41

42
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.200
You have to download it on your 
computer and then run it.
42

43
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:37.560
And so if you close your computer, it stops running,
which is actually a problem. We'll actually explore
43

44
00:02:37.650 --> 00:02:41.620
a tool called Jarvee in a later lecture,
44

45
00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:45.870
and what we have to do is put it on 
a virtual private server to make it run,
45

46
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:50.680
so that I don't have to use a dedicated computer. An
extra bonus I think is that they have some like hashtag
46

47
00:02:50.790 --> 00:02:54.690
generators, and this feature prevents shadow 
ban. Shadow ban actually is a problem,
47

48
00:02:54.690 --> 00:02:59.950
so if you keep using the same hashtags over and over 
and over again, you can run into problems with that.
48

49
00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.200
So what a shadow ban is is when Instagram stops
showing your posts at all and you just don't know.
49

50
00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:08.990
In other accounts, that's actually called ghosting, FYI.
50

51
00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:09.620
OK.
51

52
00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:14.340
So this is the cheapest, it's kind of the 
most basic, but if that's all you want,
52

53
00:03:14.340 --> 00:03:15.540
this one's a good option.
53

54
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:18.940
Now, here's another one that's also cheap, that's Combin.
54

55
00:03:18.940 --> 00:03:22.890
I don't really know how to pronounce it,
but this one runs on your computer.
55

56
00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.110
It's a little better put together.
56

57
00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:29.670
You can do things like check out 
media based on a hashtag,
57

58
00:03:29.670 --> 00:03:32.000
you can do some hashtag research.
58

59
00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:34.080
They're $10/month as well,
59

60
00:03:34.140 --> 00:03:38.100
but their big thing is they don't really press it 
when it comes to your daily interactions.
60

61
00:03:38.170 --> 00:03:42.430
You know, the limit is like 400-500, depending 
on what year you're watching this.
61

62
00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.220
They don't try to even get up there.
62

63
00:03:44.220 --> 00:03:47.140
So this one is great if you're wanting to use a bot, but
63

64
00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.510
you don't want to go crazy with it.
64

65
00:03:49.530 --> 00:03:53.910
Here's one called Social Grow, kind of the
same situation as the other ones,
65

66
00:03:53.910 --> 00:03:55.550
they're a little bit more expensive.
66

67
00:03:55.620 --> 00:03:57.630
They're $14 per week,
67

68
00:03:57.630 --> 00:04:02.520
and this thing drives me nuts, when they do this 
standard growth speed and fast growth speed.
68

69
00:04:02.580 --> 00:04:06.180
Well, with Instavast, for instance, it just has the max speed.
69

70
00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.490
There's no other speed settings.
70

71
00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.880
So this has some interesting tools, 
but for the most part, I don't know.
71

72
00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:13.080
Not really crazy about it.
72

73
00:04:13.110 --> 00:04:16.040
Remember Foundr? We kind of 
refer to his account quite a bit.
73

74
00:04:16.050 --> 00:04:17.320
This is what he uses.
74

75
00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:24.450
This one is a little unique in that it has a mobile app 
that you can use to change and update your stuff.
75

76
00:04:24.480 --> 00:04:26.460
Usually with bots, you just set it and forget it.
76

77
00:04:26.460 --> 00:04:30.180
I mean, sometimes you go back and tweak it, but it's not 
really something that's going to take a lot of attention.
77

78
00:04:30.180 --> 00:04:31.020
I mean, sometimes you go back and tweak it, but it's not 
really something that's going to take a lot of attention.
78

79
00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:38.040
Next one worth looking at is called Social Flight
and they're getting a little bit more expensive,
79

80
00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:39.680
so they're $36/month.
80

81
00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:48.840
Now, with these guys, they try to max out your 
follows, but they also try to give you chat support.
81

82
00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.220
So that's kind of the extra angle.
82

83
00:04:51.290 --> 00:04:56.850
So it's a bot, but you can also constantly talk to them about 
optimizing it, and they can do some of the work for you.
83

84
00:04:56.850 --> 00:04:58.000
So it's a bot, but you can also constantly talk to them about 
optimizing it, and they can do some of the work for you.
84

85
00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.110
Keyword being "some." Okay,
85

86
00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.090
so they're pretty common and pretty popular.
86

87
00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:08.670
Now, here's Instamacro, and this is where we really start 
stepping up the scale. Instamacro is something like $50/month.
87

88
00:05:08.670 --> 00:05:10.230
Now, here's Instamacro, and this is where we really start 
stepping up the scale. Instamacro is something like $50/month.
88

89
00:05:10.410 --> 00:05:14.130
But that's because their package comes with a lot more.
89

90
00:05:14.270 --> 00:05:14.480
OK.
90

91
00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.830
So it's $60 for 30 days.
91

92
00:05:16.830 --> 00:05:24.160
Now, if you buy an advanced, you can drop it 
down to about $30/month, but you're never really
92

93
00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:25.360
going to get it below that.
93

94
00:05:26.010 --> 00:05:29.280
So with them, they just have a lot more features.
94

95
00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:35.580
And generally, my suggestion with this one is that try 
this after you have a lot of experience with Instagram,
95

96
00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:39.960
you kind of know what you're doing, because
this one is not the most obvious one to use.
96

97
00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.350
This one just has a lot of features in it and a lot of kind 
of weird counter-intuitive ways about doing things.
97

98
00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.650
This one just has a lot of features in it and a lot of kind 
of weird counter-intuitive ways about doing things.
98

99
00:05:46.650 --> 00:05:50.850
Now, if you're an expert on Instagram, then you can 
actually squeeze a lot of juice out of their system.
99

100
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:55.500
But for you guys, especially if you're new, this
is not something I generally recommend.
100

101
00:05:55.550 --> 00:05:59.860
Now, the last one we're going to look at is called Boostio, 
and they're on the other end of the spectrum.
101

102
00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.860
So Instavast is the simplest and the cheapest.
102

103
00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.560
Well, these guys are the most 
expensive and the most complicated.
103

104
00:06:06.570 --> 00:06:09.060
Now, they justify the price,
104

105
00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:10.700
so your basic is that,
105

106
00:06:10.710 --> 00:06:12.570
and then your $150 is right there.
106

107
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:19.240
They justify this because they give you scheduling 
and they also act more like an agency.
107

108
00:06:19.240 --> 00:06:19.500
They justify this because they give you scheduling 
and they also act more like an agency.
108

109
00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:24.960
So they actually schedule times when you can talk 
to virtual assistants, they give you a virtual assistant
109

110
00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:30.450
who manages your tasks for you, 
checks in on them, gives you updates etc.
110

111
00:06:30.450 --> 00:06:35.880
So if that's something you want, if you want help with 
optimization, you want someone looking over it,
111

112
00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:39.410
then this is also an option, just keep
in mind it's kind of expensive,
112

113
00:06:39.420 --> 00:06:39.690
then this is also an option, just keep
in mind it's kind of expensive,
113

114
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:43.020
especially if you start getting more accounts 
and you start getting up into the $150 range.
114

115
00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:43.490
especially if you start getting more accounts 
and you start getting up into the $150 range.
115

116
00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:47.310
What is the benefit of having someone 
watching over this process?
116

117
00:06:47.310 --> 00:06:49.020
Honestly, I don't know.
117

118
00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:55.170
There's a benefit to them checking in to see who's 
following back and what hashtags are getting the most
118

119
00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:56.820
engaged people for you,
119

120
00:06:56.850 --> 00:07:01.160
that's a benefit, but for the most part, they don't 
need to check to make sure that your follows and
120

121
00:07:01.200 --> 00:07:02.150
unfollows went through.
121

122
00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:04.470
That's generally something that a robot does fine.
122

123
00:07:04.470 --> 00:07:08.520
All right, guys, so those are some options, check them 
out, make a decision for yourself. In the follow
123

124
00:07:08.520 --> 00:07:12.930
alongs, we're probably going to use Instavast and then
we'll use an account system called Jarvee later
124

125
00:07:12.930 --> 00:07:14.570
on when we start expanding.
125

126
00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:22.180
But personally, I would probably use Instavast 
or Combin. Instamacro maybe, it just depends.
126

127
00:07:22.290 --> 00:07:23.970
I might try that later on.
127

128
00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.550
So if you guys have experiences with these, you can post 
in the Slack, share it with everybody else. Otherwise,
128

129
00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:28.650
I will see you in the next lecture.
