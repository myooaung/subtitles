00:00:00,450 --> 00:00:05,340
All right, guys, we are back to wrap up the last major
thing that we need to do to set up our account
1

2
00:00:05,370 --> 00:00:07,110
and get ready to impress.
2

3
00:00:07,110 --> 00:00:12,180
Last thing we need to do is put that call to action in your bio.
3

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:17,370
Now, remember, Instagram lets you put
one link in your bio, and that is really it.
4

5
00:00:17,370 --> 00:00:19,320
You can't really put links anywhere else.
5

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:23,850
I mean, you can put them in your captions and in your
photos, but they're not links, like, you can't click
6

7
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:26,510
them and go somewhere, they have to manually type it in.
7

8
00:00:26,520 --> 00:00:32,280
So the gateway from your Instagram account and
something out there that's real and makes money is pretty
8

9
00:00:32,280 --> 00:00:35,370
much all funneled through this one blue link.
9

10
00:00:35,370 --> 00:00:38,910
Not to say that Instagram isn't real, and let's be serious,
10

11
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:42,500
there are cats with larger follower bases than politicians,
11

12
00:00:42,630 --> 00:00:44,580
but I think you get what I'm saying. Anyway,
12

13
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:50,730
let's use the last sentence of the bio to draw the
attention of the user to that ever-so-important link.
13

14
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:53,580
Now, will people just click it themselves?
14

15
00:00:53,580 --> 00:00:55,200
No, not at all.
15

16
00:00:55,230 --> 00:00:59,520
People are not just whirl-winding around
your account, clicking at random.
16

17
00:00:59,550 --> 00:01:05,850
They only do things for a purpose, as shallow as that purpose
may be. You need to tell them why they should click your link.
17

18
00:01:05,850 --> 00:01:06,810
They only do things for a purpose, as shallow as that purpose
may be. You need to tell them why they should click your link.
18

19
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:09,410
So, first of all, what is your link?
19

20
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:12,600
Well, you know, why exactly do you want to use Instagram?
20

21
00:01:12,600 --> 00:01:14,110
That's the broader question.
21

22
00:01:14,160 --> 00:01:17,640
Chances are, you want to use it as
a channel for growing your business.
22

23
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:23,370
If you're just a person, then maybe you just want to
promote your personal brand, and there isn't necessarily
23

24
00:01:23,370 --> 00:01:26,160
a monetary goal attached to it... yet.
24

25
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:31,800
We're going to talk a lot more about making money
through your account in a way later section in the course,
25

26
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:32,390
We're going to talk a lot more about making money
through your account in a way later section in the course,
26

27
00:01:32,460 --> 00:01:37,470
but what I can summarize is that, in most likelihood,
you're going to link them to the home page of your
27

28
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:44,030
site, to a lead magnet offering something for free,
or directly to a product you want them to buy.
28

29
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,120
Usually it falls in those three categories.
29

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:53,940
One gets you traffic, one gets you email addresses, and
the other one just gets you direct revenue, potentially.
30

31
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,190
So decide what it is that you want to promote to begin with.
31

32
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,750
That's going to be the focus of your call to action.
32

33
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:03,590
Now, the best practice is to use your last line of your
bio as your "Hey, here's a reason to click this thing."
33

34
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:06,330
Now, the best practice is to use your last line of your
bio as your "Hey, here's a reason to click this thing."
34

35
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:09,520
So treat this like any other piece of advertising.
35

36
00:02:09,630 --> 00:02:14,310
If you were running an ad for Facebook, for
instance, how would you get them to click a link?
36

37
00:02:14,310 --> 00:02:20,430
Generally, the best thing to do is to convince them they'll get immediate value from it, or to articulate what it is they get.
37

38
00:02:20,490 --> 00:02:21,850
Generally, the best thing to do is to convince them they'll get immediate value from it, or to articulate what it is they get.
38

39
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:28,510
OK, it could be 50% off of something, it could be
a free e-book, or a webinar, or whatever it is.
39

40
00:02:28,590 --> 00:02:33,410
It could just be, you know, "This is how your
life will change by clicking the link", whatever.
40

41
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:34,860
Want to lose 10 pounds?

41

42
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:35,520
Want to lose 10 pounds?
Who doesn't? Click the link.
42

43
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:36,540
Want to lose 10 pounds?
Who doesn't? Click the link.

45

46

47
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:43,980
You get the point.
47

48
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,450
I need to know in one sentence that I'm going to get something tangible or it's going to answer a question I have in my head.
48

49
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:49,290
I need to know in one sentence that I'm going to get something tangible or it's going to answer a question I have in my head.
49

50
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,810
The rules of the game really are simple.
50

51
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:51,830
It's one sentence.
51

52
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,730
It should tell them what they will gain by clicking it and I strongly suggest that you make that thing immediate and tangible.
52

53
00:02:56,760 --> 00:02:58,040
It should tell them what they will gain by clicking it and I strongly suggest that you make that thing immediate and tangible.
53

54
00:02:58,050 --> 00:03:04,610
The call to action "To learn more, click here" is
just weak tea, and it performs like soggy said tea.
54

55
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,720
The next thing I'd suggest is doing what most people
do and using a down arrow to visually indicate
55

56
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:11,760
what you're talking about exactly.
56

57
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:13,530
It just points the eyes down.
57

58
00:03:13,530 --> 00:03:18,780
Now, you can use a down arrow like this, or you could
use this angled arrow, which is actually kind of
58

59
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:24,250
more accurate, because on web, the link
will be at a slight angle from the sentence.
59

60
00:03:24,270 --> 00:03:28,860
So use whatever you want, but the whole idea is you
want to direct their eyes downward, and you see this
60

61
00:03:28,860 --> 00:03:31,220
on pretty much all accounts that are well made.
61

62
00:03:31,230 --> 00:03:33,460
Now, use something relevant to what you're doing.
62

63
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:37,360
I'll probably link in my account to, like, one of my courses.
63

64
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,930
And in that case, what I'll say is "Want to learn [...]?"
It'll have something to do with my content and
64

65
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:44,690
linking to a course that has something to do with that.
65

66
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:51,100
Or it could be "Learn to do..." whatever it is,
and then some kind of a kicker, like a discount.
66

67
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:55,680
I can also link to a company and just
kind of set up like an affiliate relationship,
67

68
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,020
we'll decide this later on in the follow along sections.
68

69
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:02,910
Now, you usually see call the actions in the
form of "Want to do something? Here's how."
69

70
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:05,610
Or "Join [...] and get [...]."
70

71
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,170
Or, if you're like, say, promoting a book, it'll be
"I accomplished [...]. Learn about it here/Get it here."
71

72
00:04:11,250 --> 00:04:13,470
Or, if you're like, say, promoting a book, it'll be
"I accomplished [...]. Learn about it here/Get it here."
72

73
00:04:13,650 --> 00:04:15,540
Anyway, I think you get the drift.
73

74
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,750
Go ahead and put together something that
makes sense, and I'll see you in the next lecture.
74

75
00:04:19,770 --> 00:04:25,680
Oh, and by the way, if you're stuck, we actually have
more templates and examples attached in the resources,
75

76
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:31,350
so hopefully just going through those and answering
the questions should get you to a call to action.
76

77
00:04:31,380 --> 00:04:33,450
You don't have to be a marketing major to pull this off well,
it's actually quite simple, so don't overthink it.
77

78
00:04:33,450 --> 00:04:35,940
You don't have to be a marketing major to pull this off well,
it's actually quite simple, so don't overthink it.
78

79
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,360
All right, guys.
79

80
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:37,260
With that being said, moving on.
80

81
00:04:37,260 --> 00:04:37,910
With that being said, moving on.
