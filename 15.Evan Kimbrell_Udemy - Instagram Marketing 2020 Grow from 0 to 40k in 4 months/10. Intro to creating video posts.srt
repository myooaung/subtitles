Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,980 --> 00:00:06,810
OK, hopefully you are now inundated with ways of
creating interesting photos to post to your feed.
2

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:11,780
Images are the backbone of the majority
of accounts, so that's why we hit them first.
3

4
00:00:11,850 --> 00:00:16,170
If you don't think you're going to do video,
although I'd say, please have an open mind,
4

5
00:00:16,180 --> 00:00:17,690
they're easier than you think.
5

6
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:22,440
But if you're insistent, then I'd probably say skip
the next set of lectures, and when you're ready to
6

7
00:00:22,440 --> 00:00:24,280
incorporate video, then just come back.
7

8
00:00:24,300 --> 00:00:25,510
OK, let's talk about videos.
8

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:27,240
Do you remember the basics?
9

10
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:29,010
If not, it's pretty simple.
10

11
00:00:29,010 --> 00:00:34,180
Videos are a maximum of - currently, because Lord only
knows what it'll be when you watch this - 60 seconds long.
11

12
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:35,660
Videos are a maximum of - currently, because Lord only
knows what it'll be when you watch this - 60 seconds long.
12

13
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:41,880
They always display like this with this camera icon
in the post corner. When you see them in a feed,
13

14
00:00:41,880 --> 00:00:44,060
they do actually auto play now.
14

15
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,950
I might have misspoken before. They didn't auto play
on your profile wall, but they do when you're looking 
15

16
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,070
at them in the feed view.
16

17
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:52,220
Kind of makes sense.
17

18
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,850
You know, if they played on the wall,
18

19
00:00:53,850 --> 00:00:59,790
you'd probably go crazy, and in the feed view, you're
clearly looking at the video, so it just plays, although
19

20
00:00:59,790 --> 00:01:03,670
there is a little bit of a lag to let the user
kind of dwell on the thumbnail  a little bit.
20

21
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:09,090
Now, videos display at basically the exact same size
images, and they can be uploaded in the same exact
21

22
00:01:09,090 --> 00:01:11,880
three orientations - square, landscape, or portrait.
22

23
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,300
There's something like one pixel different
than photos, for whatever reason.
23

24
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,110
So that's the standard for how they work.
24

25
00:01:18,150 --> 00:01:19,430
Let's talk about content.
25

26
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:24,600
Do you have to have your own camera gear, your own
lighting equipment, a director, and some karmically
26

27
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:26,910
challenged peon that has to hold your boom mic?
27

28
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:28,710
No, you don't need that stuff.
28

29
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,620
Instagram is the platform of production value, and
the more you use, the more users will appreciate
29

30
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:37,800
though. Plenty of accounts are making
it without any of that stuff.
30

31
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:43,680
Now, you can make videos using the exact same stuff you made images with, not the same tools, but the same graphic assets.
31

32
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:44,710
Now, you can make videos using the exact same stuff you made images with, not the same tools, but the same graphic assets.
32

33
00:01:44,730 --> 00:01:48,850
It's perfectly fine to make static images and
have text come on and off the screen.
33

34
00:01:48,860 --> 00:01:50,850
Just take a look at The Onion.
34

35
00:01:50,850 --> 00:01:52,730
They do this all the time.
35

36
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:57,990
You can see it's just headlines followed by images
with quotes, and then they might have like one really
36

37
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:02,380
short animation, but the rest of it
is just static images and pop up text.
37

38
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:02,600
OK.
38

39
00:02:02,610 --> 00:02:05,530
So how do you make a video out of
pictures without it looking like crap?
39

40
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:06,690
Good question.
40

41
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,790
You use a thing called motion.
41

42
00:02:08,860 --> 00:02:14,670
Not emotion - motion, like things moving. Motion is the
differentiator between "Wow, that's a stale image
42

43
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:19,800
and I realize it's an image" and "Hey, that looks pretty
cool." Actually in videography we have a term called
43

44
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,040
Ken Burns, and a lot of people have turned it into a
verb, like "I just Ken Burns that" - maybe that's just me.
44

45
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:26,570
Ken Burns, and a lot of people have turned it into a
verb, like "I just Ken Burns that" - maybe that's just me.
45

46
00:02:26,580 --> 00:02:27,440
I don't know.
46

47
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:32,560
Have you ever watched a documentary from
Ken Burns like "Ken Burns - The Civil War" or
47

48
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:34,270
"Ken Burns - Vietnam War"?
48

49
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:34,860
What else did he do?
49

50
00:02:34,860 --> 00:02:40,980
He did a bunch of stuff, he's really famous, you hopefully
have noticed that he uses this technique over and over again.
50

51
00:02:40,980 --> 00:02:46,110
So what he does is he just takes one image and then
he just slowly zooms in on it so that you have the
51

52
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,550
effect of getting closer to the image and also
have your frame of reference move slightly.
52

53
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:57,750
So technically it zooms and pans - panning, of course,
is when you move side to side with the camera.
53

54
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,660
It's incredible how much of a difference this really makes.
54

55
00:03:00,660 --> 00:03:03,100
It just feels like you're watching a video even though it's not.
55

56
00:03:03,110 --> 00:03:03,910
It just feels like you're watching a video even though it's not.
56

57
00:03:03,930 --> 00:03:05,190
So that is the secret sauce.
57

58
00:03:05,190 --> 00:03:10,320
Just add motion. For images, just
zoom in slowly or pan from side to side.
58

59
00:03:10,410 --> 00:03:15,790
Then you can bring in text with a basic animation,
like have it pop on screen or swing in from the side.
59

60
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:21,830
If you've watched my other courses, you'll notice
I love that slide effect for text, where it just flies in
60

61
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,770
from one direction and lands in place - I probably overuse it.
61

62
00:03:24,990 --> 00:03:27,940
Can you incorporate videos and
images in your Instagram video?
62

63
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:33,120
OK, of course you can, and we'll cover how to use other people's footage as well and how to incorporate them in your stuff.
63

64
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:33,980
OK, of course you can, and we'll cover how to use other people's footage as well and how to incorporate them in your stuff.
64

65
00:03:33,990 --> 00:03:34,980
That's a later lecture.
65

66
00:03:35,010 --> 00:03:37,520
Now, how do you make an effective video?
66

67
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:42,210
OK, it's all nice and whatnot to know how to put
them together, but what parts make it work?
67

68
00:03:42,340 --> 00:03:46,760
Well, first of all, you need the video to
get to the point as quickly as you can.
68

69
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:51,180
Whatever it is that's interesting in the video
needs to be front loaded in the first 15 seconds.
69

70
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:52,060
Why is that?
70

71
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,490
Well, attention spans. Look at this video engagement graph that shows attention as you go from zero to 60 seconds.
71

72
00:03:56,490 --> 00:03:57,530
Well, attention spans. Look at this video engagement graph that shows attention as you go from zero to 60 seconds.
72

73
00:03:57,540 --> 00:04:01,630
It's like a roller coaster going straight
down for the first five seconds.
73

74
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:03,900
So you need to hook them as soon as you can.
74

75
00:04:03,900 --> 00:04:09,000
Otherwise, they'll just leave the video. And people
that don't watch the entire video are much less likely
75

76
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:11,430
to engage with the post, which is what we want.
76

77
00:04:11,430 --> 00:04:12,450
Another tip for video.
77

78
00:04:12,450 --> 00:04:15,050
Don't forget your CTA or your call to action.
78

79
00:04:15,090 --> 00:04:18,310
You'd use a call to action in a video
just like you would in a picture.
79

80
00:04:18,360 --> 00:04:20,780
You want people to like your post?
80

81
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:22,370
You say it in the video.
81

82
00:04:22,410 --> 00:04:24,110
You want them to follow you?
82

83
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:27,750
Say it in the video. If you want them to
tag a friend, say it in the video. OK.
83

84
00:04:27,900 --> 00:04:29,840
You have their attention, so don't waste it.
84

85
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:31,650
Another thing you really need to incorporate,
85

86
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,870
guess what? Did you know that 80% of
video views happen without volume?
86

87
00:04:35,940 --> 00:04:36,520
Yeah.
87

88
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:39,370
That's what you get when you make autoplay a thing,
88

89
00:04:39,370 --> 00:04:44,080
Instagram. People almost always watch it on silent
for at least a couple seconds to see if it's worth
89

90
00:04:44,100 --> 00:04:47,080
tapping on, and then deciding to hear the audio.
90

91
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:49,040
So what does that mean for us?
91

92
00:04:49,050 --> 00:04:53,010
Well, it means you need to make sure
the video makes sense without audio.
92

93
00:04:53,010 --> 00:04:55,340
Otherwise no one is going to tap on it.
93

94
00:04:55,410 --> 00:05:01,320
That means focus on the imagery and not the dialogue, or at
least put text it on the screen that narrates what's happening.
94

95
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:02,580
That means focus on the imagery and not the dialogue, or at
least put text it on the screen that narrates what's happening.
95

96
00:05:02,580 --> 00:05:05,550
That one is really important for getting
people to watch your video.
96

97
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:07,010
Cannot stress that one enough.
97

98
00:05:07,020 --> 00:05:12,300
The last thing I'll say on making your videos effective is
you need to remember that your video usually displays
98

99
00:05:12,330 --> 00:05:15,260
first as a static image and then plays.
99

100
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,290
That means one of the reasons someone either
stops to watch or skips your video is the thumbnail.
100

101
00:05:21,310 --> 00:05:21,850
OK.
101

102
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:28,080
The static starting image that they see. You want to
make sure you pick a thumbnail that makes sense
102

103
00:05:28,110 --> 00:05:34,320
given the context of your video, one that doesn't have
someone making a contorted face, or ideally show
103

104
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,490
something visually interesting, or at least
implies action and piques their interest.
104

105
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:43,830
When you upload your video to the Instagram
app, they let you choose a thumbnail there.
105

106
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:48,720
Unfortunately, they kind of limit you to only using
a frame that's inside the actual video, which is, you
106

107
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,830
know, perfectly fine sometimes, but there are ways
around this, and we'll probably talk about it later.
107

108
00:05:54,870 --> 00:05:59,210
Now, the next couple of lectures, we're going to cover
apps that let us create videos optimized for Instagram.
108

109
00:05:59,230 --> 00:06:03,700
I'll tell you upfront that editing videos inside
of Instagram itself is pretty much garbage,
109

110
00:06:03,720 --> 00:06:08,970
and we're going to skip it. I don't even suggest capturing
video inside of their camera app or the camera function
110

111
00:06:08,970 --> 00:06:11,840
inside of their app, because, well, it crashes all the time.
111

112
00:06:11,850 --> 00:06:13,380
That kind of limits your control.
112

113
00:06:13,380 --> 00:06:13,720
OK.
113

114
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,750
That's more than enough to take in all at once.
114

115
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,720
Videos are awesome, but only if you do them right.
115

116
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,610
Make sure they're visually interesting.
116

117
00:06:20,610 --> 00:06:21,600
This is Instagram, remember? People have the same
attention spans as bats or other winged creatures.
117

118
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:26,880
This is Instagram, remember? People have the same
attention spans as bats or other winged creatures.
118

119
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,610
Remember to consider how the video will look if it's muted,
119

120
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,070
and don't forget your thumbnail.
120

121
00:06:31,110 --> 00:06:37,440
Also, video in the Instagram app is crap, unless it's been
updated since I've filmed this - possible, I don't know.
121

122
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:38,010
Also, video in the Instagram app is crap, unless it's been
updated since I've filmed this - possible, I don't know.
122

123
00:06:38,030 --> 00:06:39,090
Alright guys, see you next lecture.
