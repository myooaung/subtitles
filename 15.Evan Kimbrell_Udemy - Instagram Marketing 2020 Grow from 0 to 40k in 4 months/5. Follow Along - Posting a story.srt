00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:04,560
Hey guys welcome back to this lecture are going to do is we're going to post a story on innovation station

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:09,150
just to kind of go through the motions or show you what it's like now the next lecture We'll talk about

3
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:14,760
our story strategy at innovation station and how it's kind of evolved over time it's changed a couple

4
00:00:14,760 --> 00:00:19,940
of times but we're just going to use stories to fulfill a purpose.

5
00:00:19,930 --> 00:00:26,130
So what we'll do is we'll just go to the app and what I'm thinking is I'm thinking about trying some

6
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:28,150
giveaways later this week.

7
00:00:28,310 --> 00:00:31,710
And if you guys want to check out the giveaway section there is a section on it in this course.

8
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,150
And in order to do that I thought it would be interesting just to run a poll and a story to ask people

9
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:40,050
what they wanted as a giveaway since we're just a cool tech account.

10
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:47,610
There's a lot of like small gadgety things and I think it's pretty important to get some feedback beforehand.

11
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:50,840
Before I go and pick something that nobody wants and no one participates.

12
00:00:50,940 --> 00:00:57,660
So what I'll do is just go over the home screens operate and get into my story mode then I create an

13
00:00:57,660 --> 00:00:58,560
image over here.

14
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:06,900
So my idea was I was going to give this instax 6 away or this Amazon echo and they're both kind of equal

15
00:01:06,900 --> 00:01:07,500
value.

16
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:10,070
So I was kind of curious what people cared about more.

17
00:01:10,070 --> 00:01:16,170
I don't know if the tide has kind of gone out on Amazon Eco's or if people didn't know what these instax

18
00:01:16,170 --> 00:01:19,310
Polaroid cameras are anyway so I made this image in Photoshop.

19
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:20,870
All it did is I just took two images.

20
00:01:20,910 --> 00:01:25,440
Google Image searched through them together and then put a white background is really easy you could

21
00:01:25,440 --> 00:01:28,440
do it in Kanva to some people.

22
00:01:28,440 --> 00:01:31,920
For some reason you can add multiple images to their stories.

23
00:01:31,950 --> 00:01:34,730
It was a feature that's on some accounts maybe Android accounts can do it.

24
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:36,860
I can't seem to figure out how to do it.

25
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:41,190
It might have been an older version of Instagram so I had to just make the image myself which is not

26
00:01:41,190 --> 00:01:42,660
that big of a deal it took me two seconds.

27
00:01:42,690 --> 00:01:42,860
OK.

28
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:49,140
So this is what I have and then I will do as I will right at the top giveaway and then I'll give them

29
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:50,490
the date.

30
00:01:50,550 --> 00:01:54,030
So it's a good.

31
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:56,810
Change it to something that doesn't look like crap.

32
00:01:56,920 --> 00:01:59,270
Sort of background like that.

33
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:05,910
So give away and then I'll put the day underneath it.

34
00:02:06,010 --> 00:02:10,300
So I see six.

35
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:11,280
OK.

36
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:21,010
So Saturday timber eight and I'll say 3 three.

37
00:02:21,550 --> 00:02:23,990
So put that right there.

38
00:02:24,060 --> 00:02:33,780
Change the color of that sticks out in a red you know as I twisted it twice showing it like that.

39
00:02:34,190 --> 00:02:39,120
So I could twist it in a little bit larger.

40
00:02:39,190 --> 00:02:40,280
The easiest thing in the world to do.

41
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:41,330
But there you go.

42
00:02:41,690 --> 00:02:41,930
OK.

43
00:02:41,930 --> 00:02:49,430
So Saturday September 8 3 p.m. I should really put the time zone in it just because other people don't

44
00:02:49,430 --> 00:02:52,850
know what it is to change this to.

45
00:02:52,850 --> 00:02:55,750
Same color shrink.

46
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:01,930
Oh boy I'm really stretching my fingers here and put it there.

47
00:03:02,030 --> 00:03:03,720
Ok cool.

48
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:10,370
So give away and then we're going to do is put a pole in the middle so we'll put a pole you remember

49
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:12,740
I can change the question and the answer.

50
00:03:12,740 --> 00:03:17,520
So which one do you prefer.

51
00:03:19,420 --> 00:03:24,270
You prefer a question mark and I'll put it simply echo.

52
00:03:25,940 --> 00:03:34,050
Got the swan instax 6 Hopefully they know what these are.

53
00:03:34,450 --> 00:03:41,860
If they don't who knows sea so can't really change the color unfortunately.

54
00:03:42,090 --> 00:03:46,100
But what I can do is I can put something behind it.

55
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:49,540
So what I'm going to do actually because I can't see it in the background as I'm trying to get rid of

56
00:03:49,540 --> 00:03:52,290
the tax of the top and I write that out.

57
00:03:52,750 --> 00:03:56,760
So we see some of issues here.

58
00:03:57,610 --> 00:03:58,970
So I put it there.

59
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:09,840
So trying to put this so it doesn't block judges.

60
00:04:09,850 --> 00:04:15,560
If I had to redo this I would put some spacing in between these.

61
00:04:15,720 --> 00:04:17,250
So I think that's decent.

62
00:04:17,250 --> 00:04:22,170
I mean it cuts off the image of the instax which is not a deal.

63
00:04:22,200 --> 00:04:24,170
So I can do it like death with the text in the middle.

64
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:25,520
The voting down at the bottom.

65
00:04:25,530 --> 00:04:31,990
And then I'll draw like an arrow see or something that I can point it out with.

66
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:38,200
So am going to use like this.

67
00:04:38,290 --> 00:04:45,880
So pull down an arrow pointing at it that way they can't forget and just throw some moseys on there

68
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:49,880
just to make it look more festive.

69
00:04:49,910 --> 00:04:52,160
I don't know.

70
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:59,330
So put some confetti.

71
00:04:59,450 --> 00:05:00,110
OK.

72
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:03,600
So give away Saturday September at 3:00 p.m. Yes.

73
00:05:03,710 --> 00:05:04,730
Which one you prefer.

74
00:05:04,730 --> 00:05:10,460
So I don't think there's anything else that I need to do with this one or that so it doesn't have any

75
00:05:10,460 --> 00:05:11,510
volume on it.

76
00:05:11,570 --> 00:05:13,680
I didn't have any volume going with.

77
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:19,400
And then we just go to send to and we'll go to our sharing options for a story and then we'll go to

78
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,280
share to our story.

79
00:05:21,470 --> 00:05:23,990
And that is pretty much it.

80
00:05:24,020 --> 00:05:30,640
So it's safe just in case you know exit out great here and I should be able to see it go OK.

81
00:05:30,650 --> 00:05:33,170
So give away Saturday September.

82
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:34,130
Which do you prefer.

83
00:05:34,130 --> 00:05:36,850
And then what they can do is just click to one they prefer.

84
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:43,100
So it's easy to show up at the end of our post today.

85
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:45,370
There you go Sarah someone one of the unstacked six.

86
00:05:45,380 --> 00:05:46,250
There we go.

87
00:05:46,250 --> 00:05:47,950
Now it's 100 percent OK.

88
00:05:48,140 --> 00:05:55,310
And then what I can do is later on when I actually gotten votes from people I can just pull up the analytics

89
00:05:55,310 --> 00:05:56,040
on it.

90
00:05:56,120 --> 00:05:57,970
So scroll to it and then go to the give.

91
00:05:57,980 --> 00:06:01,780
And as you can see it always shows a one person seen it perfectly fine.

92
00:06:01,780 --> 00:06:04,160
But yeah.

93
00:06:04,460 --> 00:06:06,110
So that was pretty easy right.

94
00:06:06,110 --> 00:06:08,240
It's a great way of getting engagement with people.

95
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:11,810
It's a great way of reminding people that hey we're going to do a giveaway on Saturday and it's a really

96
00:06:11,810 --> 00:06:13,640
quick easy way to get them involved.

97
00:06:13,640 --> 00:06:17,100
Hopefully people actually will mark down the date for the give away.

98
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,140
It was kind of a secondary purpose but I just showed you how easy it is to make something like that.

99
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,050
The only problem was just putting the images together.

100
00:06:23,060 --> 00:06:25,770
I just did it on the computer really fast.

101
00:06:25,930 --> 00:06:28,110
You can just do it by phone.

102
00:06:28,130 --> 00:06:31,910
Go to Google Images find something throw it on there and then throw in some tax and it's pretty easy

103
00:06:31,910 --> 00:06:33,360
to make it look decent.

104
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:37,880
You know I don't think this is fantastically great but this is exactly what you'd expect in a story.

105
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:38,120
All right.

106
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:39,550
So guys that's it for now.

107
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:44,390
The next lecture will do is it will go over the innovation station story strategy and I'll give you

108
00:06:44,390 --> 00:06:47,470
a little bit of background on what we do for our stories.

109
00:06:47,480 --> 00:06:47,840
See that.
