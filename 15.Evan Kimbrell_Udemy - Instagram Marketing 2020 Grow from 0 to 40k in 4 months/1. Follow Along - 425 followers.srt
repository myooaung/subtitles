00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:01,610
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:02,060
OK.

3
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:03,940
So it is day.

4
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:05,710
I want to say nine.

5
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:07,670
I'm not even tired really the.

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:15,320
I have not yet started posting my 5:55 a day as my goal and in fact actually what I've been doing the

7
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:19,580
last two days or three days has been just alternating days.

8
00:00:19,620 --> 00:00:23,430
So I only posted one day out of three.

9
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:29,160
Now I'm just doing that because I want to preserve some of the content that I'm making just because

10
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:32,420
it's a little bit of a waste in this holding pattern that I'm kind of stuck.

11
00:00:32,490 --> 00:00:39,730
So we can take out the account where we're at Yeah so we had 22 posts.

12
00:00:39,790 --> 00:00:46,290
And again I was just doing this as a holding pattern just because I didn't want to lose followers.

13
00:00:46,330 --> 00:00:49,400
But I also just didn't want it to look like it was in fact over.

14
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:53,310
I just had a big chunk of time where I wasn't posting anything.

15
00:00:53,350 --> 00:00:55,070
So that's what I've been doing on the posting side.

16
00:00:55,090 --> 00:01:01,200
I am finally to the point though where I'm going to start posting consistently tomorrow.

17
00:01:01,350 --> 00:01:08,680
Now the problem was that I just hadn't gotten to a point where I had a large enough stockpile of videos

18
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:15,880
and quotes made and also the internal velocity as you would of the contractors I'm using to make these

19
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:17,890
videos we just weren't up to speed.

20
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:23,200
I mean we were at a point where we were making five a day but that just doesn't relieve a lot of room

21
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:23,930
for error.

22
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:27,820
Case one contractor kind of disappears or starts doing something wrong.

23
00:01:27,820 --> 00:01:31,010
I just wanted to make sure I had a good chunk before I started so.

24
00:01:31,180 --> 00:01:38,290
All right looking at the innovation station Trello you can kind of see what the totals are in each column

25
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:40,300
and that's really what I was going off of.

26
00:01:40,390 --> 00:01:47,230
This is actually from a system called original card counter for Trello So if you use Chrome just go

27
00:01:47,230 --> 00:01:53,260
to the Chrome store or the Chrome Web App Store and then just search for card counter for Trello and

28
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:57,880
all that does it just adds this number appear which is actually really helpful because at a glance sometimes

29
00:01:57,880 --> 00:01:59,060
you just don't know.

30
00:01:59,260 --> 00:02:03,710
So I know that needs review that means basically I'm ready to post these.

31
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:06,760
I have 58 and I'm posting five times a day.

32
00:02:06,760 --> 00:02:13,700
I'M ALMOST AT 12 days of posting so I think that is a decent stockpile.

33
00:02:13,750 --> 00:02:21,380
You can see over here we still have a bit of a bottleneck when it goes from video to editing.

34
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:22,690
It is perfectly fine.

35
00:02:22,690 --> 00:02:27,850
I mean it kind of makes sense and I've actually been spending more time targeting this one specifically

36
00:02:28,660 --> 00:02:30,340
and then over here and captions.

37
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,740
I mean these just get written very very quickly because the caption is I've been using actually doing

38
00:02:35,740 --> 00:02:42,000
a really good job and they're doing it very quickly and consistently on the contractor front.

39
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:49,030
If you guys followed the entire section on outsourcing this work or automating this work we talked about

40
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:55,180
running trials and then how to determine which type of contractor you need.

41
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:59,920
Now in that section we talk a little bit about this but what happened was I was looking for people to

42
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,320
find media.

43
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:08,320
So I just wanted people to essentially do this or it says I'm gathering media because it ends up being

44
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:11,070
the case that it takes about an hour to make a video.

45
00:03:11,380 --> 00:03:13,330
If you have to gather then media yourself.

46
00:03:13,330 --> 00:03:18,280
So I wanted to isolate that activity and then try to get people to find media because then someone can

47
00:03:18,280 --> 00:03:24,520
assemble it really quickly and I could focus on having a cheaper person just find media that just really

48
00:03:24,520 --> 00:03:25,210
do not work.

49
00:03:25,210 --> 00:03:27,670
I only found one person who could do this consistently.

50
00:03:27,670 --> 00:03:35,140
And I went through probably 10 people doing trials and they just were not good enough at it consistently

51
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:41,050
running into problems so what I am doing was switching to finding video editors and I just kind of ate

52
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:42,370
the extra cost.

53
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:43,800
I mean they're not that much more expensive.

54
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:47,040
Some of these editors are like $10 an hour now.

55
00:03:47,080 --> 00:03:48,150
It's not the ideal way to do it.

56
00:03:48,160 --> 00:03:49,620
But sometimes this just happens.

57
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:50,870
You just hit a jam.

58
00:03:50,920 --> 00:03:55,510
Whatever system you're making or step by step process you're trying to design sometimes just one of

59
00:03:55,510 --> 00:03:58,810
the steps is wrong and so that was the problem that I was having there.

60
00:03:58,820 --> 00:04:01,480
So so far that's been cleared up.

61
00:04:01,480 --> 00:04:09,250
The other thing I was using was an app called screen full screen full screen f u l dot me.

62
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,760
Now what they do is they take your Trello boards and give you analytics.

63
00:04:13,780 --> 00:04:14,930
Check it out for yourself.

64
00:04:15,010 --> 00:04:22,210
But on this app what I was specifically using it for was because I wanted to make sure I had a lot of

65
00:04:22,210 --> 00:04:26,370
videos ready in the basket so to speak to post.

66
00:04:26,410 --> 00:04:31,190
And then at the same time I wanted to make sure that we were producing enough on a day to day basis.

67
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,530
I was using these analytics to tell what the speed of each card was going through the Trello process.

68
00:04:36,730 --> 00:04:40,110
So here I can see for instance the lead time is six days 19 hours.

69
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:46,960
That means when I create a new needs captions card this one right here all the way all the way on the

70
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:48,750
left.

71
00:04:48,760 --> 00:04:53,770
It takes about six days ish seven days to go through the entire process.

72
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:55,690
So that's perfectly fine.

73
00:04:55,700 --> 00:05:01,590
You can see right here that it sits in that pile a long time usually sits in the pile for four days.

74
00:05:01,630 --> 00:05:04,000
So that's the reaction time before someone actually grabs it.

75
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,820
That's perfectly fine because I'm not using it for say like a web app where we're doing bugs and features

76
00:05:09,820 --> 00:05:13,760
and things that need our e-mails or things that need immediate attention.

77
00:05:13,900 --> 00:05:18,490
Doesn't really matter I just want to make sure that it's not taking too long to get through.

78
00:05:18,490 --> 00:05:19,990
Now this is the cycle time.

79
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:23,030
Typically it takes about two days.

80
00:05:23,140 --> 00:05:26,380
Once someone starts it to actually get it through.

81
00:05:26,380 --> 00:05:29,900
So what this basically tells me is they wanted to optimize something.

82
00:05:29,920 --> 00:05:36,470
I would start either putting fewer things in the captions or getting the captions to go a little bit

83
00:05:36,920 --> 00:05:42,510
her because you can see that they take up you know four days of the seven and then what I was looking

84
00:05:42,510 --> 00:05:46,170
at over here is just the completed tasks you can see right here.

85
00:05:46,230 --> 00:05:53,730
This is the growth as we've been making more and more posts and this is a rolling seven day average.

86
00:05:53,790 --> 00:05:57,510
So it just looks at the average per day in that seven day period.

87
00:05:57,510 --> 00:05:58,470
Now as I scroll.

88
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,560
So what you see is the essentially the velocity of the average number of ones are putting in the completed

89
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,070
pile are going up.

90
00:06:06,090 --> 00:06:07,300
And that's a good thing.

91
00:06:07,410 --> 00:06:13,290
Also right here in the last seven days we've made 35 thirty five is you know five a day and so that

92
00:06:13,290 --> 00:06:19,110
was kind of the red line that once we completed it I said OK we can start posting.

93
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:21,030
So that's what I'm happy to see.

94
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:22,070
So check out screenful.

95
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,870
You guys have an opportunity.

96
00:06:24,030 --> 00:06:28,180
We'll check in here with iconv Square really quickly just so you can see that.

97
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:31,620
Yeah not much has been happening here right here the follower growth.

98
00:06:31,650 --> 00:06:37,650
So this was growing when I was doing the initial publishing to get my 10.

99
00:06:37,650 --> 00:06:38,950
And then I was doing one a day.

100
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:43,830
And so I was going up pretty fast and then kind of just plateaued because well I just stopped posting

101
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:48,950
them because I was just going to wait till I had enough post to just start going full throttle.

102
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,050
So nothing else really has changed.

103
00:06:52,050 --> 00:06:57,840
See in the next lecture how everything's going as we start posting seriously and then we start looking

104
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,470
for shout outs and then we start getting into things like stories and other stuff like that.

105
00:07:03,480 --> 00:07:08,940
But that's the next step and once I start getting that going then it'll be much easier to reach out

106
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,090
to people and really start implementing some growth strategies.

107
00:07:12,190 --> 00:07:12,600
OK.

108
00:07:12,710 --> 00:07:13,340
So you next chapter.
