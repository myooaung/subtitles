Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
1

2
00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:06.660
Now that we're in the posting section and out of the
woods, it only makes sense that we talk about what
2

3
00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:11.940
exactly goes into a post and what parts are
most affected by the Instagram algorithm.
3

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:16.650
All right, let's break it down, let's dissect this like
it was a frog and you were in the first grade.
4

5
00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:19.020
Unless you are actually in the first grade,
in which case, no offense.
5

6
00:00:19.140 --> 00:00:20.360
Unless you are actually in the first grade,
in which case, no offense.
6

7
00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.280
This is a blank post and I think you've seen this before.
7

8
00:00:24.330 --> 00:00:29.190
Some have said the Instagram algorithm is capricious and testy like God in the Old Testament - kind of just made that up.
8

9
00:00:29.190 --> 00:00:30.050
Some have said the Instagram algorithm is capricious and testy like God in the Old Testament - kind of just made that up.
9

10
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:35.540
Excuse me for stating the obvious, but there are about
five different things on this that we care about
10

11
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:37.670
and we'll try to optimize in this section.
11

12
00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:38.780
Ignoring the photo,
12

13
00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:40.410
we have a caption right there.
13

14
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.370
We have tags, which show up on
the photo itself or on the captions.
14

15
00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:47.760
We have hashtags, which can
be in several different places.
15

16
00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:49.340
We have a call to action.
16

17
00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:52.950
And lastly, we have a possible location geotag.
17

18
00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:57.890
Those five things are what determines, outside of
the image itself, how well your account grows.
18

19
00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:02.160
A good post usually has the following:
it usually has a well thought out caption.
19

20
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:06.350
Some people post really short captions, and
guess what? Those don't perform as well.
20

21
00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:11.580
While most people like brevity on Instagram, for
whatever reason, they generally like longer captions.
21

22
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:17.220
I guess it's because some of the more hardcore fans will actually read it all, and if it's good, it will increase their engagement.
22

23
00:01:17.220 --> 00:01:18.540
I guess it's because some of the more hardcore fans will actually read it all, and if it's good, it will increase their engagement.
23

24
00:01:18.550 --> 00:01:22.310
You do that a lot and you'll start snowballing
a team of sycophants in no time.
24

25
00:01:22.320 --> 00:01:24.750
The next thing a post needs is a call to action.
25

26
00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:25.710
Now, what do I mean?
26

27
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.270
Well, look at the last sentence in a caption. Most
times it'll be there to tell people to do something.
27

28
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.670
Sign up for an email course.
28

29
00:01:31.860 --> 00:01:35.170
Tag someone who has a head shaped like
this object. Like the post if you agree.
29

30
00:01:35.190 --> 00:01:36.410
Tag someone who has a head shaped like
this object. Like the post if you agree.
30

31
00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.590
Check out this other person's profile.
31

32
00:01:38.590 --> 00:01:39.390
Whatever.
32

33
00:01:39.390 --> 00:01:44.490
Every post should have a point and your call to action
is what gets people to do whatever it is that
33

34
00:01:44.490 --> 00:01:45.840
you wanted them to do.
34

35
00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:51.000
A lot of people forget to do this or just don't care,
and that's perfectly fine, but they're just not
35

36
00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.850
going to grow their accounts as fast as everybody else.
36

37
00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.580
Next up, we have tags, and to be honest, these have
very little bearing on whether the post is a hit or not.
37

38
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.350
Next up, we have tags, and to be honest, these have
very little bearing on whether the post is a hit or not.
38

39
00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.090
They're more used as a reciprocity tool for other
Instagram accounts to get their attention and hopefully
39

40
00:02:06.090 --> 00:02:08.010
get them to do the same as you.
40

41
00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:09.640
After that, we have hashtags.
41

42
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:11.910
What those are, we will get into later.
42

43
00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.190
But here's the short of it.
43

44
00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.550
Hashtags are those words that begin with the pound
sign, and when you have a hashtag on a post, it adds
44

45
00:02:17.550 --> 00:02:20.900
that post to a public list of photos sorted by that word.
45

46
00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.000
So if you posted a photo of steak and eggs and
tagged it with - and yes, it's tagged it with,
46

47
00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:29.730
even though we already have tags, I don't
know why, but that's the way you say it -
47

48
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.000
even though we already have tags, I don't
know why, but that's the way you say it -
48

49
00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:37.230
let's say you did it with #breakfast, then when anyone
searches for #breakfast on Instagram, well, they'll
49

50
00:02:37.230 --> 00:02:40.850
see any photos with that hashtag, including yours.
50

51
00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:46.140
Hashtags are one of the chief ways to grow your account, and
accordingly, we have an entire section dedicated to them.
51

52
00:02:46.140 --> 00:02:46.790
Hashtags are one of the chief ways to grow your account, and
accordingly, we have an entire section dedicated to them.
52

53
00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:50.370
We'll get into these a bit more in this section as well.
53

54
00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:51.560
Last thing worth mentioning, location tags. When
you make a post, you can tag it with the location.
54

55
00:02:51.570 --> 00:02:55.040
Last thing worth mentioning, location tags. When
you make a post, you can tag it with the location.
55

56
00:02:55.050 --> 00:03:00.330
That way, when people are viewing photos that are
generically associated with a location, you do this
56

57
00:03:00.330 --> 00:03:05.130
just by searching a location and clicking on the
dropdown that has a location bubble or pin.
57

58
00:03:05.130 --> 00:03:09.780
Also, the best photos in each location get put together
in the top post that show at the top of this
58

59
00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:14.240
view and in stories that automatically
get posted in several spots on the app.
59

60
00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:19.980
Not everyone uses a location because, well, not all
posts have a location associated with them, and
60

61
00:03:19.980 --> 00:03:26.060
that's perfectly fine. If you can fit a location then that's
better, because, well, that's just extra exposure.
61

62
00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:28.840
Also worth noting is you can make up your location.
62

63
00:03:28.860 --> 00:03:33.270
There's nothing that says you have to check in
at Applebee's if you're at Applebee's.
63

64
00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:35.030
Nothing really to be ashamed of.
64

65
00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:35.950
They have great apps.
65

66
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.860
So when we post, we need to check off each of these boxes.
66

67
00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:43.140
No, I'm not saying, d'oh, you need to put a caption.
67

68
00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:46.680
I mean, we need to focus on doing
the best we can in each category.
68

69
00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:49.380
That's how you grow, not just by winging it, and
69

70
00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.730
forgetting to do something.
70

71
00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:57.000
So in terms of the almighty algorithm, the thing we live and
die by, basically, what should we be most concerned about?
71

72
00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:57.920
So in terms of the almighty algorithm, the thing we live and
die by, basically, what should we be most concerned about?
72

73
00:03:57.960 --> 00:04:03.450
Well, the almighty algorithm, peace be
upon him, cares primarily about two things:
73

74
00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:07.580
your engagement rate and your average time on a post.
74

75
00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:12.310
First thing is a magical number that we'll use later
on when evaluating accounts to partner with,
75

76
00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:13.730
and it's pretty easy to do.
76

77
00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:19.110
You take the total number of interactions you have
on a post, interactions meaning only two things, likes
77

78
00:04:19.110 --> 00:04:22.320
and comments, and you divide it by the
total number of followers the account has.
78

79
00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:23.320
and comments, and you divide it by the
total number of followers the account has.
79

80
00:04:23.350 --> 00:04:30.210
OK, let's say you had 25 interactions on a post,
could be 15 comments and 10 likes or 20 likes
80

81
00:04:30.210 --> 00:04:32.570
and 5 comments. Whatever they are,
81

82
00:04:32.610 --> 00:04:38.000
they weigh the same in this calculation.
And let's say you had 500 followers.
82

83
00:04:38.030 --> 00:04:41.940
OK, 25 divided by 500 is 5%.
83

84
00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.210
And in the land of Instagram, that is
actually an excellent engagement rate.
84

85
00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:46.800
Good for me, made up example. 
The average for all accounts site
85

86
00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:49.710
Good for me, made up example. 
The average for all accounts site
86

87
00:04:49.710 --> 00:04:55.800
wide is something shy of like 2%, and it varies pretty
heavily depending on the industry you're in.
87

88
00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.400
wide is something shy of like 2%, and it varies pretty
heavily depending on the industry you're in.
88

89
00:04:56.400 --> 00:04:58.600
Some get higher, some get lower just naturally.
89

90
00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:02.840
So, if you're getting 5% consistently, then
you are doing something very right.
90

91
00:05:02.910 --> 00:05:06.460
The other number they care about
is the time spent on your post.
91

92
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:12.390
Now, no one is 100% sure how this is calculated or
weighted, but even if someone doesn't like your
92

93
00:05:12.390 --> 00:05:18.780
post or comment on it, they still know how long they
sat there and looked at your photo, watched your
93

94
00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:20.970
photo or scrolled through the comments.
94

95
00:05:21.030 --> 00:05:26.230
They use this just as a general barometer
of how engaging this content is,
95

96
00:05:26.250 --> 00:05:30.010
and is this account targeting the
right people with the right stuff?
96

97
00:05:30.060 --> 00:05:34.950
So keep those two terms in the back of your pocket,
because they'll be useful to keep in mind as we move
97

98
00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:38.690
through the course - engagement
rate per post and time on post.
98

99
00:05:38.700 --> 00:05:43.290
Unfortunately, if I had to tell you the absolute
specifics of the algorithm itself, I'd have to kill you,
99

100
00:05:43.470 --> 00:05:45.120
but we're not going to do that.
100

101
00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:45.590
All right.
101

102
00:05:45.590 --> 00:05:47.740
You now know what matters when we post.
102

103
00:05:47.850 --> 00:05:53.380
We tinker with the caption, the call to action,
the tags, the location, the hashtags,
103

104
00:05:53.380 --> 00:06:00.450
and we do all of this so that we can move the needle
on two metrics - time on post and engagement rate.
104

105
00:06:00.990 --> 00:06:03.760
That is all that matters in this sad life.
105

106
00:06:03.780 --> 00:06:05.880
On that note, see you in the next lecture.
