Hey guys, welcome to the obligatory course overview
lecture, where I very quickly overview the course.
1

2
00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:07.680
Let's do this as fast as we can, so we
can actually get into the good stuff.

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:09.380
Let's do this as fast as we can, so we
can actually get into the good stuff.

4
00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:14.280
So, as you know, throughout this entire course, what
we're going to be doing is creating a real Instagram
4

5
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:19.020
account. and you can check it out by going
to instagram.com/innovationstation.
5

6
00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:24.220
Some of you guys might have thought from the promo
that we would be making an account about a Husky,
6

7
00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:27.630
and all I can say is I really wish that was the case.
7

8
00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:33.180
Actually, we're going to do innovation and technology, not
nearly as cool as Huskies. The course sections are pretty
8

9
00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:34.170
easy to follow.
9

10
00:00:34.170 --> 00:00:39.600
First, we start talking about how to plan the idea for
your account, set up your account and optimize it,
10

11
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:39.810
First, we start talking about how to plan the idea for
your account, set up your account and optimize it,
11

12
00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:46.350
then we go into how to plan a content strategy, what
works, what's popular and what you can pull off. Then
12

13
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:48.220
we'll do things like laying the groundwork,
13

14
00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:52.980
we'll do some research into competitors, figure out
who we need to immediately start networking with,
14

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.680
then we'll create our first batch of content, I'll teach
you how to use a bunch of tools, and we'll design
15

16
00:00:58.710 --> 00:01:02.060
a workflow around what we think
is going to fit our content strategy.
16

17
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:08.760
Then we'll move on to posting, writing captions, picking
hashtags, and optimizing the times that you post.
17

18
00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:14.460
Then we'll set up successful growth habits, then we'll
learn how to do things like shoutouts, then bots,
18

19
00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.890
then will move on to things like stories,
19

20
00:01:17.010 --> 00:01:23.200
Instagram live, we'll do things like automated outreach,
we'll learn how to create zombie accounts, we'll
20

21
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:28.330
learn how to hire freelancers and how to
automate and scale our content production,
21

22
00:01:28.380 --> 00:01:34.110
we'll even learn how to run successful competitions
and four different ways that we can make money on
22

23
00:01:34.110 --> 00:01:36.020
Instagram with the account that we've grown.
23

24
00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:41.820
Then, as the more astute of you have noticed, at the very
end we have all of the follow along lectures, where
24

25
00:01:41.820 --> 00:01:45.810
you can follow me from 200 followers
all the way up to whatever we're at
25

26
00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.180
now. Alright guys, with that being said,
I hope you enjoy the course.
26

27
00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:53.880
If you already have an account, please be
smart about where you start the course.
27

28
00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:58.020
If you already have an optimized profile and everything
like that, then you don't need to do the first
28

29
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:01.380
section. If you already know how to post,
then you don't need to do the posting section.
29

30
00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:06.170
Pick where you feel comfortable and keep in mind,
you can always watch these videos at 2x playback
30

31
00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:09.440
if you think you know some of the content.
Alright guys, with that being said,
31

32
00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:14.660
I'm excited to present to you the Instagram course
that I've been working on for six months.
32

33
00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:15.300
Alright, see you inside!
