00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:09.690
Hey guys, welcome back. OK, I'm going to talk about
how I got a logo for the account Innovation Station.
1

2
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:12.510
We can throw it up on the screen right now if you want to see it.
2

3
00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.150
So, before we talked about what your options were, you can use auto-generators, you can hire someone directly from Dribbble,
3

4
00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.250
So, before we talked about what your options were, you can use auto-generators, you can hire someone directly from Dribbble,
4

5
00:00:19.250 --> 00:00:25.770
you can try to hack it out yourself,
or you can do a logo contest.
5

6
00:00:25.770 --> 00:00:26.070
OK.
6

7
00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:30.460
So what I opted to do was a logo contest.
7

8
00:00:30.560 --> 00:00:37.950
The reason was just because I had good experiences
with them generally, and I find that they're better if
8

9
00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:41.230
you have a very broad idea of what you want as a logo.
9

10
00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:46.320
At least if you have a flexible set of criteria, like, I
could be impressed with a lot of different designs,
10

11
00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:51.440
aesthetics, icons, whatever, but it is kind of hit or miss.
11

12
00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:54.250
That's another thing worth pointing out, sometimes
it doesn't really work out, sometimes it does.
12

13
00:00:54.360 --> 00:00:55.550
That's another thing worth pointing out, sometimes
it doesn't really work out, sometimes it does.
13

14
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:59.460
I've done it enough times to be confident that I
can get out of it what I want, so I did it this way.
14

15
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:01.980
I've done it enough times to be confident that I
can get out of it what I want, so I did it this way.
15

16
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:07.260
I set my thing at $500 just because I'm actually
going to take this seriously, I am going to build this
16

17
00:01:07.260 --> 00:01:11.580
account, I'm actually going to put actual production
value into it, I want to make sure it looks good.
17

18
00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:13.370
account, I'm actually going to put actual production
value into it, I want to make sure it looks good.
18

19
00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.880
I'm going to focus on the content and actually
try to post consistently and make this grow.
19

20
00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:24.750
So I said that for me that's a decent investment.
I think you could get just as good of a logo spending
20

21
00:01:24.780 --> 00:01:30.510
$200 and hiring someone directly, or even
on Fiverr sometimes. A lot of time, you're just
21

22
00:01:30.510 --> 00:01:34.620
rolling the dice, finding the right designer,
and giving them the right instructions.
22

23
00:01:34.620 --> 00:01:37.680
So let's just kind of go through
how the contest went for me.
23

24
00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:42.760
When you go to 99designs, they ask you
to set the amount that you want to pay.
24

25
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.220
They'll ask you what exactly you want.
25

26
00:01:44.220 --> 00:01:46.760
I just said logo, just logo,
26

27
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:51.800
and then in my brief, I described logo
plus some actual little things that I wanted.
27

28
00:01:52.030 --> 00:01:58.140
That said, I could do a bronze plan for $250, a silver for $499,
a gold for like $800, and a platinum for way over $1,000.
28

29
00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.600
That said, I could do a bronze plan for $250, a silver for $499,
a gold for like $800, and a platinum for way over $1,000.
29

30
00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:04.820
And basically what they say is that
as you go up higher on the scale,
30

31
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:06.600
you get access to better designers.
31

32
00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:09.800
Now, I'm going to tell you something, that's not actually true.
32

33
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:12.600
People are just attracted to the price value.
33

34
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:17.170
You can get access to top designers regardless
of what category you go in, so I knew that,
34

35
00:02:17.190 --> 00:02:22.500
but also I knew that they're incentivized by the money, so
I went for a silver, and originally I didn't have it guaranteed.
35

36
00:02:22.500 --> 00:02:24.540
but also I knew that they're incentivized by the money, so
I went for a silver, and originally I didn't have it guaranteed.
36

37
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:28.630
What that basically means is that if you don't have a
guarantee, that means that if people make a bunch of
37

38
00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:29.780
designs and you don't like it,
38

39
00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:34.350
you go through the whole process, you get your money back. If you do decide to make a guarantee, that means
39

40
00:02:34.350 --> 00:02:37.520
you'll have more people participating, they'll feel
more confident making the designs, because you're
40

41
00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.360
not just going to pull out at the very last second.
41

42
00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:43.660
It says guaranteed right now because, as
I'll explain, they do their system in rounds.
42

43
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.570
Anyway, once I did it, I called it "Instagram
account for innovation and tech lovers."
43

44
00:02:47.580 --> 00:02:49.060
That's pretty much it.
44

45
00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.440
I wanted to focus on "it's an Instagram
account", like, the medium is different,
45

46
00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:58.260
this is not a logo for a website, it's not a logo for
like a YouTube channel or anything like that.
46

47
00:02:58.260 --> 00:02:59.380
It's Instagram, it's small assets, it's on your phone.
47

48
00:02:59.460 --> 00:03:01.870
It's Instagram, it's small assets, it's on your phone.
48

49
00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.690
It's Instagram, it's small assets, it's on your phone.
49

50
00:03:03.830 --> 00:03:05.620
Anyway, focus on that - square images.
50

51
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:07.950
Then I had to fill out a brief.
51

52
00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:11.690
Now, in the brief, I just said this is the
name I wanted, Innovation Station.
52

53
00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:15.540
Describe what your organization product does and
its target audience. Then I just said "I'm making an
53

54
00:03:15.540 --> 00:03:20.070
Instagram account, and we're going to post pictures and videos every day of interesting innovations and new technologies.
54

55
00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:21.120
Instagram account, and we're going to post pictures and videos every day of interesting innovations and new technologies."
55

56
00:03:21.150 --> 00:03:26.780
The handle is this, I said our target audience is the
general tech loving population, but also entrepreneurs.
56

57
00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:30.800
I kind of got this from just playing around on it.
57

58
00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:36.000
Later on, we'll talk about how to lay the foundation of
the framework to figure out who your target market was.
58

59
00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:36.790
Later on, we'll talk about how to lay the foundation of
the framework to figure out who your target market was.
59

60
00:03:36.810 --> 00:03:41.130
So I did some bouncing around and just kind of looked
at the people who like innovation accounts also
60

61
00:03:41.130 --> 00:03:44.130
like entrepreneurship, they also like startups
and the general business community.
61

62
00:03:44.130 --> 00:03:49.560
And also, it kind of made sense in my head, like, those
are the people that would probably follow this. I said
62

63
00:03:49.560 --> 00:03:52.240
I didn't know what the demographics are, doesn't really matter.
63

64
00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:55.380
Then what I did is I gave them some
examples of what we would cover.
64

65
00:03:55.380 --> 00:03:58.700
This is usually pretty helpful so they can
actually visualize what it's going to look like,
65

66
00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.810
what are the actual topics. Then I said,
this is basically what I wanted,
66

67
00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:13.170
a logo. I preferred a symbol plus text. Now, a symbol is
just some kind of icon that the company is represented by,
67

68
00:04:13.170 --> 00:04:13.510
a logo. I preferred a symbol plus text. Now, a symbol is
just some kind of icon that the company is represented by,
68

69
00:04:13.520 --> 00:04:17.090
it has no text, and it's like, Nike is a swoosh.
69

70
00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.330
That's what I wanted.
70

71
00:04:18.330 --> 00:04:19.910
McDonald's is like the M, right?
71

72
00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:20.390
McDonald's is like the M, right?
72

73
00:04:20.490 --> 00:04:25.120
But then other companies have what's called
logotype and that is, their logo is text.
73

74
00:04:25.140 --> 00:04:27.290
So I just said I want this symbol,
74

75
00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.130
and then plus text separately.
75

76
00:04:30.660 --> 00:04:35.550
And the font, I just said pick a font that goes well in a post, something that looks good in a small screen resolution.
76

77
00:04:36.090 --> 00:04:37.640
And the font, I just said pick a font that goes well in a post, something that looks good in a small screen resolution.
77

78
00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.770
Then I said, you know, we're going to use it as a visual
mark, we're going to put it on photos and videos, you
78

79
00:04:43.770 --> 00:04:46.410
see a lot of accounts do that, it's pretty effective.
79

80
00:04:46.410 --> 00:04:50.490
And then I just kind of gave them a brief description
of what Instagram in general likes. They like clean,
80

81
00:04:50.490 --> 00:04:55.280
modern logos, and you want to make sure they
look good embedded and videos and images.
81

82
00:04:55.380 --> 00:04:57.140
Also, I said colorful profile photos.
82

83
00:04:57.140 --> 00:04:58.280
We'll talk about this later.
83

84
00:04:58.350 --> 00:05:05.000
They also work pretty well, you want color, or least interesting contrast. Down here, it asked me to pick a visual style
84

85
00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.010
I wanted, and I said this last one, I like when designers
choose the visual style, I'm not an expert in this stuff,
85

86
00:05:10.010 --> 00:05:10.490
I wanted, and I said this last one, I like when designers
choose the visual style, I'm not an expert in this stuff,
86

87
00:05:10.490 --> 00:05:14.780
I don't want to pigeonhole them in one color.
Then past that, they give you these sliders.
87

88
00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.040
And it's Instagram, so I want modern, people on
Instagram don't generally go for the classic stuff. Here,
88

89
00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:20.640
And it's Instagram, so I want modern, people on
Instagram don't generally go for the classic stuff. Here,
89

90
00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:21.820
mature and youthful, didn't really matter.
90

91
00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:23.210
mature and youthful, didn't really matter.
91

92
00:05:23.220 --> 00:05:25.010
I just, I didn't care.
92

93
00:05:25.010 --> 00:05:27.150
Feminine - masculine, again, didn't really care.
93

94
00:05:27.230 --> 00:05:29.960
The wind doesn't blow either way for this account.
94

95
00:05:29.960 --> 00:05:34.820
I wanted it to be a little more playful, because again,
Instagram, they go for more like playful things,
95

96
00:05:34.820 --> 00:05:35.280
I wanted it to be a little more playful, because again,
Instagram, they go for more like playful things,
96

97
00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.250
they're not trying to take anything super serious,
but they don't like stuff that looks cheap.
97

98
00:05:39.290 --> 00:05:39.550
they're not trying to take anything super serious,
but they don't like stuff that looks cheap.
98

99
00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:45.230
So I said luxurious as opposed to economical. Here, organic - geometric, geometric just means is it shaped like a shape
99

100
00:05:45.230 --> 00:05:50.090
you could recognize or is it organic, so something that's abstract.
100

101
00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:55.820
So geometric design could be like an octagon
with a shape inside, and organic could
101

102
00:05:55.820 --> 00:06:02.180
just be some crazy squiggly lines, like a signature or
something. And then abstract and literal, abstract
102

103
00:06:02.180 --> 00:06:07.690
could be that crazy squiggly line you look at
and you don't know what it is, it's just
103

104
00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:10.250
something, a blob, and literal means
I look at it and I know what it is.
104

105
00:06:10.250 --> 00:06:12.240
something, a blob, and literal means
I look at it and I know what it is.
105

106
00:06:12.260 --> 00:06:15.530
It's an animal, it's a car, whatever.
106

107
00:06:15.590 --> 00:06:18.440
And then they ask you to pick designs that you like.
107

108
00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:21.100
Whatever, I picked the ones that I just thought looked good.
108

109
00:06:21.150 --> 00:06:28.040
Again, modern, clean, looks like something that's
made actually in this decade, not from, like, 2006.
109

110
00:06:28.230 --> 00:06:33.710
And then I gave some information about why. You'll notice that
I picked things that looked modern, had good color, and just
110

111
00:06:33.710 --> 00:06:34.970
kind of looked polished.
111

112
00:06:35.100 --> 00:06:37.760
Down here, it says, "Anything else you
want to communicate to the designers?"
112

113
00:06:37.920 --> 00:06:44.300
I just said like, it needs to look good on an Instagram page,
and then what I did was I gave them a link to two different things.
113

114
00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:46.460
I just said like, it needs to look good on an Instagram page,
and then what I did was I gave them a link to two different things.
114

115
00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:54.230
One was freepik.com, and they had an Instagram frame,
and that Instagram frame is super helpful, because
115

116
00:06:54.380 --> 00:07:00.950
I wanted them to post it on the actual frame so
I could see what it looks like in a post - like this.
116

117
00:07:01.190 --> 00:07:05.600
I don't want to see it by itself because I don't know
what that looks like on an actual Instagram account.
117

118
00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.340
And down here I gave them Instagram's link to their assets.
118

119
00:07:09.350 --> 00:07:11.150
I'll put this in the resources.
119

120
00:07:11.150 --> 00:07:12.060
Same thing.
120

121
00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.580
They let you download screenshots of it
so that people can edit with it. Great.
121

122
00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:22.910
Then, other than that, I just said like, you know, here's
sample text from a post that we might use, I said
122

123
00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:27.110
we're going to probably focus on videos
over photos, doesn't really matter.
123

124
00:07:27.110 --> 00:07:29.780
I mean, this is what I was thinking at the moment.
124

125
00:07:30.180 --> 00:07:32.850
Then, the rest of it is pretty much... whatever.
125

126
00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:39.180
OK, so basically what ended up happening was
they predicted that I was going to have 60 designs.
126

127
00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.950
I got almost 200.
127

128
00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:46.890
Now, the way that I did this was as
soon as you start your contest, go
128

129
00:07:46.910 --> 00:07:54.500
up here, go to designers. What you can do is just go
here to search and you can look through designers,
129

130
00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.620
and all I did was I just scrolled through
every day, looked at the ones that I liked,
130

131
00:07:59.630 --> 00:08:02.750
I was like, "Oh, that looks like a good one," clicked their name,
131

132
00:08:02.750 --> 00:08:07.110
then all I had to do was click "Invite to my
project," so it says "Invite to work".
132

133
00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:13.230
I just wrote a one sentence message, and it said, "Your
designs rock, I have a contest I think you could win."
133

134
00:08:13.250 --> 00:08:14.000
I just wrote a one sentence message, and it said, "Your
designs rock, I have a contest I think you could win."
134

135
00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.050
I just wrote a one sentence message, and it said, "Your
designs rock, I have a contest I think you could win."
135

136
00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:15.710
That's it.
136

137
00:08:15.710 --> 00:08:16.990
You want to compliment them, tell them that
you're actually interested in what they do.
137

138
00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.870
You want to compliment them, tell them that
you're actually interested in what they do.
138

139
00:08:19.010 --> 00:08:20.720
And then I just said,
139

140
00:08:20.790 --> 00:08:22.690
so they are actually interested in, this is a contest,
140

141
00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:27.590
they want to actually know that they can win, not waste their time, not spend five hours on a logo, then someone else wins it.
141

142
00:08:27.830 --> 00:08:28.750
they want to actually know that they can win, not waste their time, not spend five hours on a logo, then someone else wins it.
142

143
00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:30.980
So that's one little hack that I always do.
143

144
00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.690
They allow you to send 50 messages a day.
144

145
00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:34.020
Make sure you use all 50.
145

146
00:08:34.040 --> 00:08:37.460
That's how you get a lot of attention on your actual project.
146

147
00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:40.220
It makes a huge difference. If I only had 60 designs,
I don't think I'd have a logo I like as much.
147

148
00:08:40.220 --> 00:08:42.620
It makes a huge difference. If I only had 60 designs,
I don't think I'd have a logo I like as much.
148

149
00:08:42.830 --> 00:08:47.960
Anyway, so people post every single day and
they give you all sorts of different designs.
149

150
00:08:48.050 --> 00:08:51.420
What you need to do is you need to rate them.
150

151
00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:55.450
So 1-5 on stars, and you need to give them comments.
151

152
00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:55.970
I mean, that's it.
152

153
00:08:55.970 --> 00:09:00.280
The more information you give them, the more people will
participate in the contest, but also will go in the right direction.
153

154
00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:01.510
The more information you give them, the more people will
participate in the contest, but also will go in the right direction.
154

155
00:09:01.740 --> 00:09:05.290
If you don't really know what to say about
certain things, honestly just sit on it.
155

156
00:09:05.300 --> 00:09:07.950
That's what happens. There's a lot of these logos like this.
156

157
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:13.400
I like the colors, but I didn't really know what to say,
so I kind of just sat on it, and then I really
157

158
00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:19.100
came up with was I think it looks generic and I can't
tell if it's something related to the account or not.
158

159
00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.820
came up with was I think it looks generic and I can't
tell if it's something related to the account or not.
159

160
00:09:19.850 --> 00:09:25.160
I also just kept saying over and over again, please,
no abstract designs, I don't want abstract designs,
160

161
00:09:25.220 --> 00:09:27.590
I don't generally think those work on Instagram.
161

162
00:09:27.590 --> 00:09:30.520
People need to be able to look
at the logo and know what it is,
162

163
00:09:30.530 --> 00:09:34.690
otherwise it just looks like some blank account that
they have no idea what they're clicking through
163

164
00:09:34.690 --> 00:09:39.250
to. Anyway, so you can kind of see the back
and forth that happened with a lot of designers.
164

165
00:09:39.290 --> 00:09:44.620
There were a whole lot of designs that I
just absolutely hated, and this is how it works.
165

166
00:09:44.630 --> 00:09:44.990
There were a whole lot of designs that I
just absolutely hated, and this is how it works.
166

167
00:09:44.990 --> 00:09:47.490
I mean, it's just part of the game.
167

168
00:09:47.510 --> 00:09:52.110
You will have the option to give
them 1-5, but you also can trash it.
168

169
00:09:52.160 --> 00:09:52.610
You will have the option to give
them 1-5, but you also can trash it.
169

170
00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:54.420
So what you can do is you can go to the design.
170

171
00:09:54.570 --> 00:09:56.290
Ok, so this gives me the cup.
171

172
00:09:56.450 --> 00:10:01.950
But if I go here, and there should be a trash icon,
I don't have it now because the contest is done,
172

173
00:10:02.170 --> 00:10:06.920
but that basically throws it away, basically says "This
design is so bad, I'm not even going to consider it,"
173

174
00:10:07.120 --> 00:10:11.940
and essentially that means to the designer,
"You're not going in any direction that I like,
174

175
00:10:12.040 --> 00:10:17.770
I don't even want other designers to see this," because
if you rate one, what ends up happening is designers
175

176
00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:20.320
will see that you rated something.
176

177
00:10:20.410 --> 00:10:24.790
What happens is they'll use that to inform
their judgment about what to design.
177

178
00:10:24.790 --> 00:10:29.920
So if I liked a rocket, then all of a sudden a lot
of people were going to show up with rockets.
178

179
00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.970
The difference between trashing a design
and doing a one star, by the way,
179

180
00:10:33.970 --> 00:10:37.650
a one star means there's things I
like about it, but it's not good enough,
180

181
00:10:37.750 --> 00:10:42.280
whereas a trashed design means "Please
don't consider any part of this." Anyway,
181

182
00:10:42.290 --> 00:10:44.150
so, yeah, I just kind of went through this.
182

183
00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:47.530
I tried to give comments as often as I could.
183

184
00:10:47.530 --> 00:10:53.470
One thing that's really helpful is to be able to click
through and click on the image to comment,
184

185
00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.310
so you can say I don't like this.
185

186
00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:59.030
So like, with this design, I just thought this was bizarre.
186

187
00:10:59.140 --> 00:11:05.260
So we were trying to figure out what icons to use,
and they decided to put a beaker inside of a rocket,
187

188
00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.240
which just doesn't really make a lot of sense to me, like,
why are you shooting a rocket with a beaker in it? Anyway,
188

189
00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:12.650
which just doesn't really make a lot of sense to me, like,
why are you shooting a rocket with a beaker in it? Anyway,
189

190
00:11:13.090 --> 00:11:18.790
a couple of times, what I did was I sent messages
to the entire group, just because I saw that everyone
190

191
00:11:18.790 --> 00:11:23.060
was doing the same design things, and I wanted to
send a message saying, "Hey, let's try something else."
191

192
00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.350
So a couple of times I said, "Please, no abstract logos,"
"Please don't use fonts that look too sci-fi,"
192

193
00:11:28.350 --> 00:11:32.290
"Try not to use light bulbs." I think
light bulbs are too much of a cliche.
193

194
00:11:32.290 --> 00:11:34.030
Everyone uses them, it's just dumb.
194

195
00:11:34.150 --> 00:11:36.390
Then what ended up happening was
I started giving people ideas.
195

196
00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.560
I said, what are things that represent innovation?
196

197
00:11:38.560 --> 00:11:41.920
I said robots, charts, gears, rockets, beakers, things like that.
197

198
00:11:41.920 --> 00:11:45.240
So that kind of gave people a little bit more direction.
198

199
00:11:45.670 --> 00:11:49.840
Then what happens is people keep giving you designs,
you keep rating them, and it kind of pushes it in a
199

200
00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:51.340
certain direction. After a certain amount
of days, you have to pick the finalists.
200

201
00:11:51.390 --> 00:11:53.030
certain direction. After a certain amount
of days, you have to pick the finalists.
201

202
00:11:53.050 --> 00:11:58.660
So I had to pick six designers right here that I thought
were good enough that I could continue with.
202

203
00:11:58.660 --> 00:12:04.180
Then you go through four more days, I think, working
with them to kind of hone in on something you like, and
203

204
00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:05.530
then you pick the winner.
204

205
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:06.920
So I picked these guys.
205

206
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.070
They had the best designs so far.
206

207
00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:10.590
Then we kind of worked through it.
207

208
00:12:10.660 --> 00:12:17.440
What I did also, which I thought helped a lot, was when
I picked my finalists, I put together an Evernote
208

209
00:12:17.740 --> 00:12:22.960
link full of all the designs I liked and broke them down,
why I liked them, and sent that to them, because
209

210
00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:25.310
I really wanted to make sure they
were pointing in the right direction.
210

211
00:12:25.360 --> 00:12:26.590
So it looked like this.
211

212
00:12:26.590 --> 00:12:32.030
I said, hey, here's the ones with good
fonts that I liked, and I just copied them.
212

213
00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:34.420
I just screenshoted them off of what other people had.
213

214
00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:38.970
Because a lot of times people had terrible logos but
great font. Then I said here are good uses of color.
214

215
00:12:38.980 --> 00:12:40.270
I like these uses of color.
215

216
00:12:40.270 --> 00:12:42.760
I love this one right here, specifically.
216

217
00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.830
So then I just kind of put those, so people understand
this is the bar I'm looking for in color. Then
217

218
00:12:46.930 --> 00:12:52.050
I said these are ones I think have good aesthetics or
general design, like these are all kind of smooth,
218

219
00:12:52.070 --> 00:12:54.280
they're modern, they look well polished.
219

220
00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:56.860
They also use color, but it's more subtle.
220

221
00:12:56.860 --> 00:12:59.190
So I said these are good, kind of well rounded ones.
221

222
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:02.770
And the last thing I said, these are
good uses of the Instagram frame.
222

223
00:13:02.770 --> 00:13:08.320
We'll talk about this later when we get into profile photos but it's important that you get something that works with the frame.
223

224
00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.300
We'll talk about this later when we get into profile photos but it's important that you get something that works with the frame.
224

225
00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.250
A lot of times what was happening was people would
send me designs, we can throw them up on the screen,
225

226
00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:22.480
where they would put a beaker or a rocket, and the rocket
was going outside of the circle, which you just can't do.
226

227
00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:23.660
where they would put a beaker or a rocket, and the rocket
was going outside of the circle, which you just can't do.
227

228
00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:27.880
You can't upload a circle image and
then have something flying outside of it.
228

229
00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:31.140
Instagram is going to resize that
and just make it look terrible.
229

230
00:13:31.150 --> 00:13:35.860
It was right here, that example, like, it was flying
outside of the circle, so I just really couldn't work
230

231
00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:41.940
with that one, so I tried to remind people to make sure
that it looks good in a circle, not just by itself. Anyway,
231

232
00:13:41.950 --> 00:13:48.230
so what I ended up with was the design that we all should know
at this point, right here, from a person named m.creative.
232

233
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.990
so what I ended up with was the design that we all should know
at this point, right here, from a person named m.creative.
233

234
00:13:49.990 --> 00:13:55.690
I then asked them, as the last thing, I gave
them a little ticket list of things to give me.
234

235
00:13:55.690 --> 00:14:00.310
I said I wanted different color variations, give me
a logo outline, give me a frame for a photo, and
235

236
00:14:00.310 --> 00:14:02.800
then give me a black version, because
I was interested in having the black version.
236

237
00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:03.610
And then, there we go.
237

238
00:14:03.610 --> 00:14:04.960
So I have all these different things,
238

239
00:14:04.960 --> 00:14:07.840
I have the font, and that's it, pretty much.
239

240
00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:12.790
I'm pretty much ready to go, I'm going to use these assets in
my account, and we're going to use these colors to inform
240

241
00:14:12.790 --> 00:14:14.580
my designs going forward.
241

242
00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:15.600
I think it worked out.
242

243
00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:21.110
I think you guys could get a good enough or even
a better logo with spending a lot less money,
243

244
00:14:21.220 --> 00:14:25.410
or if you have any talent or a friend
who does it, just get them to do a logo.
244

245
00:14:25.450 --> 00:14:26.570
You don't have to do it this way.
245

246
00:14:26.590 --> 00:14:31.840
I just thought it'd be interesting to show you guys what's the
most fancy or at least expensive option that I'm aware of.
246

247
00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:33.040
I just thought it'd be interesting to show you guys what's the
most fancy or at least expensive option that I'm aware of.
247

248
00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:36.290
All right, guys, look out for that logo going forward.
See you in the next lecture.
