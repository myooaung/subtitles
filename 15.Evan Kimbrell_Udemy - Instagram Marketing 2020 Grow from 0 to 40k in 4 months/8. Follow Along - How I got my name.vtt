00:00:00.380 --> 00:00:05.610
OK, so what I did for my account was
I made a list of names that I liked, right?
1

2
00:00:05.610 --> 00:00:05.910
OK, so what I did for my account was
I made a list of names that I liked, right?
2

3
00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.190
So innovation was my thing.
3

4
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:12.990
I figured that there might be a decent amount of search
traffic for people who are looking for innovation.
4

5
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.700
I don't know, it seems like that's a pretty popular
hashtag, with a lot of different variations.
5

6
00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.210
So what I kind of did is just come up
with a bunch of random names.
6

7
00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.870
I just thought of things that would make sense, so I
started with the base of innovation, and then I kind
7

8
00:00:27.870 --> 00:00:31.410
of just wondered what would make sense.
8

9
00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:36.930
And then I just kind of listed off a bunch that I thought
might work, and I just kind of search and tried
9

10
00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:38.590
to find out whether or not they're available.
10

11
00:00:38.590 --> 00:00:41.880
So the top one I wanted was innovation inspiration.
11

12
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.860
So it's not short, but it rhymes and it alliterates.
12

13
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:50.850
So those are two different things that were kind
of nice, and it makes sense, like, if I'm posting stuff
13

14
00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:57.990
for entrepreneurs or business professionals, it's
a good idea to say this is for inspiration, right?
14

15
00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:03.820
That made sense to me, and then I had backups,
and the backups were kind of in the same vein,
15

16
00:01:04.380 --> 00:01:07.870
innovation concentration, things like that.
16

17
00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.850
I kind of just went to a rhyming dictionary, and if you
go to Google and type in "rhyming dictionary", you
17

18
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:14.490
can find all the words that rhyme.
18

19
00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:20.880
So that's what I did, I went to Google, and through Google
I found a place called rhymezone.com, I put in
19

20
00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.610
innovation and just gave me a bunch.
20

21
00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:26.680
Innovation, agnation, causation, ablation.
21

22
00:01:26.870 --> 00:01:33.620
I think that's when you shoot something with a laser.
Flotation, flirtation, foundation, frustration, gas station.
22

23
00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:38.820
Anyway, so I kind of just picked ones out of here that
I thought made sense, and I tried to think of all the
23

24
00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:42.540
things that would make sense with my
content strategy and then the name.
24

25
00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:45.740
And so I came up with, I don't know,
four or five, or something like that.
25

26
00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:50.880
Once you come up with some names that you think
you like, the fastest way to check to see if they're
26

27
00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:56.160
even available is not to just go on Instagram, start
typing it in, that takes way too many clicks, actually
27

28
00:01:56.160 --> 00:02:01.080
just go to namecheckr.com, it doesn't have an E at
the end, so make sure you get that right, and then
28

29
00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:07.540
just type in the name, so like innovation inspiration
was one of mine, and you can see very quickly
29

30
00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.530
it was taken - right there.
30

31
00:02:09.580 --> 00:02:10.000
OK.
31

32
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.900
So I just check to see if they were free,
if they're free, then awesome.
32

33
00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:17.780
And if they're not, well, this is the message I get,
so I know that I have to reach out to them.
33

34
00:02:17.810 --> 00:02:23.680
Then when I did is I started looking at accounts
to see if they are active or see if they are not.
34

35
00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:30.390
So what I did was I just started looking. What
I found was innovation inspiration right here.
35

36
00:02:30.400 --> 00:02:30.880
OK.
36

37
00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:33.940
It wasn't in the same language that I speak.
37

38
00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:39.280
That was interesting. And I saw that they had seven posts,
37 followers, 23 following, doesn't look like it's active.
38

39
00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.970
That was interesting. And I saw that they had seven posts,
37 followers, 23 following, doesn't look like it's active.
39

40
00:02:39.970 --> 00:02:46.900
So I went to the last photo, looked at the bottom, it was
posted on September 8th 2015. From looking at it,
40

41
00:02:46.930 --> 00:02:48.610
just kind of bouncing around the photos,
41

42
00:02:48.610 --> 00:02:52.090
what I could ascertain was that this was done for a class.
42

43
00:02:52.130 --> 00:02:56.290
It looked like there was a business school, and it
looked like it was in Denmark, because I could
43

44
00:02:56.290 --> 00:02:58.090
go here and click on the location.
44

45
00:02:58.180 --> 00:03:00.610
Aarhus Business College, turns out that's in Denmark.
45

46
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.510
I know nothing about Denmark.
46

47
00:03:03.070 --> 00:03:06.350
And so maybe it made sense, like,
maybe they made this for a class,
47

48
00:03:06.370 --> 00:03:07.850
they're not using it anymore, cool.
48

49
00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:12.070
So what I did was I just tried to
figure out how to contact them.
49

50
00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:14.190
I sent a message to their account, no one responded.
50

51
00:03:14.260 --> 00:03:15.360
I sent a message to their account, no one responded.
51

52
00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:18.120
That happens all the time, because it's inactive, right?
52

53
00:03:18.370 --> 00:03:24.070
So what I did then is I went to their last photo, turns
out they took photos of everyone in the class who
53

54
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:26.790
was in that project group, and there.
54

55
00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:30.760
And so, at the bottom, they list it off, and I used Google
Translate figure out what they were saying, these are the
55

56
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.080
names of the people, bla bla bla, that are in these photos.
56

57
00:03:35.170 --> 00:03:41.110
And I think then what I did was I looked at who had liked the photos, so I looked at that and go, oh, wow, there you go.
57

58
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:41.980
And I think then what I did was I looked at who had liked the photos, so I looked at that and go, oh, wow, there you go.
58

59
00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:47.830
Four of these people are in this, which, again,
another good sign of this is not a serious account,
59

60
00:03:47.830 --> 00:03:52.220
if you tag, you know, five people and the only likes
you have are four people who are in them.
60

61
00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:59.410
So then all I did is I just went to each one and followed
them, and then I messaged them, and I out of those
61

62
00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:04.310
four, one of them responded and
it kind of just went back and forth.
62

63
00:04:04.310 --> 00:04:04.500
four, one of them responded and
it kind of just went back and forth.
63

64
00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:07.120
This was my number one option, so I kind of stuck with it.
64

65
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:11.800
I can kind of show you the conversation
we had, which wasn't great.
65

66
00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:21.610
One strategy I tried to employ was I used my girlfriend's
account to message them, because I just kind
66

67
00:04:21.610 --> 00:04:27.120
of figured it would make sense to use a less
threatening account, like it was a random,
67

68
00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:32.710
what I found out from that post is they're all 19 years
old in Denmark, kind of weird if some random guy
68

69
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:33.970
from America messaged them,
69

70
00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.590
But if, you know, a normal non-assuming looking
girl does it, they usually have a better response.
70

71
00:04:38.590 --> 00:04:40.960
But if, you know, a normal non-assuming looking
girl does it, they usually have a better response.
71

72
00:04:40.960 --> 00:04:43.380
So if you have a girlfriend, try that out.
72

73
00:04:43.510 --> 00:04:45.790
Usually you get better response rates for whatever reason.
73

74
00:04:45.790 --> 00:04:48.170
So what I said was "Hi," whatever
74

75
00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.610
her name is, "Are you currently using
this account? If not, can I use it?"
75

76
00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:51.740
her name is, "Are you currently using
this account? If not, can I use it?"
76

77
00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:53.940
And then I tried to give them justification.
77

78
00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.610
I tried to say like, I'm trying to teach a course on starting
a business and Instagram and it would be a perfect name.
78

79
00:04:57.610 --> 00:04:58.550
I tried to say like, I'm trying to teach a course on starting
a business and Instagram and it would be a perfect name.
79

80
00:04:58.570 --> 00:05:02.090
Then I tried to give them some backup
saying, "You can see my stuff here."
80

81
00:05:02.110 --> 00:05:07.060
I said like, "You can go to my website" to show that I'm
actually a public person, I'm not just some random
81

82
00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:09.500
person who's going to take the account and sell it.
82

83
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:12.700
That's a big thing, it's like, if you're trying to get
someone to do something nice for you, you've got to
83

84
00:05:12.700 --> 00:05:13.950
give them some kind of reason.
84

85
00:05:14.170 --> 00:05:15.400
They went to business school.
85

86
00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:19.900
I tried to connect that to business school saying I'm
teaching business classes. Then what I did is I used
86

87
00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:25.860
Google Translate, and to the best of its
ability, we translated that into Danish.
87

88
00:05:26.090 --> 00:05:32.260
And then we got one response, and she
responded in English, which was great.
88

89
00:05:32.270 --> 00:05:35.210
Turns out a lot of people in Denmark speak English, great.
89

90
00:05:35.510 --> 00:05:40.750
And basically what ended up happening was she says,
"No, we're not using it, we used it for a school project," we
90

91
00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.660
kind of confirmed that.
91

92
00:05:42.660 --> 00:05:46.480
Then she said she'll see what she can do
to deactivate the account, but no promises.
92

93
00:05:46.540 --> 00:05:52.520
Basically then what I did is I just said, "Thank you so much,"
tried to make it sound like this is something it's
93

94
00:05:52.820 --> 00:05:56.340
really like she's going out of her way to do this.
94

95
00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:03.170
And other than that, I tried to, you know, make it a little more human, like, hoping that she enjoys being done with school.
95

96
00:06:03.170 --> 00:06:04.180
And other than that, I tried to, you know, make it a little more human, like, hoping that she enjoys being done with school.
96

97
00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:09.560
I'll post this conversation in the resources so you guys
can see it. Anyway, so after that, what basically ended
97

98
00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.190
up happening was that she kind of stopped responding,
it started taking longer for her to respond.
98

99
00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:21.350
So then I messaged her kind of saying, what I thought,
what I figured out was that when you deactivate your
99

100
00:06:21.350 --> 00:06:26.930
account, that actually takes time, and I'm not sure entirely,
and Instagram is not clear on this, whether that frees
100

101
00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.520
up the name immediately.
101

102
00:06:28.970 --> 00:06:33.050
And then also, you can't do it on the mobile phone, you
have to go to the website, log in and do it that way.
102

103
00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:33.470
And then also, you can't do it on the mobile phone, you
have to go to the website, log in and do it that way.
103

104
00:06:33.470 --> 00:06:37.550
If she's just trying to do something for free, then I
wanted to make sure that's as easy as possible, so
104

105
00:06:37.550 --> 00:06:42.560
I let them know actually if you just go to the profile
section and just change your name by one letter,
105

106
00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:43.650
that's all you have to do, it frees up the name.
106

107
00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:44.910
that's all you have to do, it frees up the name.
107

108
00:06:44.980 --> 00:06:46.060
So I told them that.
108

109
00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:47.550
Blah blah blah.
109

110
00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:50.270
Then she's like, "I'm going to help you," or whatever,
110

111
00:06:50.270 --> 00:06:52.110
but she clearly doesn't.
111

112
00:06:52.470 --> 00:06:57.080
And I tried then to get this moving, because otherwise
it was going to take a month, tried to offer them
112

113
00:06:57.080 --> 00:07:01.010
money, which, you know, it could have
been a good strategy or a bad strategy,
113

114
00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:06.020
I don't know. Sometimes it gets people to work on
it, like, actually put this as a higher priority than
114

115
00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:09.070
just spacing out all day or whatever they do.
115

116
00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:13.760
And sometimes it actually makes them think all of
a sudden that there's more money to be had.
116

117
00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.340
So I only use it if I'm kind of desperate.
117

118
00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:21.440
So I offered them $100, they said it looks fair enough.
118

119
00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:29.870
And then it gets to this point where she says she got into
her account and finally figured out how to get into it.
119

120
00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:30.250
And then it gets to this point where she says she got into
her account and finally figured out how to get into it.
120

121
00:07:30.250 --> 00:07:30.900
That's great.
121

122
00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:36.380
But then she just didn't do anything, and then completely
did a 180 and changed her mind, where she said
122

123
00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:41.780
"I'd have to talk to my classmates before deactivating
it or anything," because, you know, clearly this free
123

124
00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.750
account is being used by them, and that is something
that you have to discuss with all of your friends,
124

125
00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:52.880
and come to a group decision about how you're not
going to use this class account anymore. Anyway,
125

126
00:07:52.970 --> 00:07:53.640
Not impressed with Danish teenagers. After that
point, I just said this is clearly going nowhere,
126

127
00:07:53.650 --> 00:07:58.140
Not impressed with Danish teenagers. After that
point, I just said this is clearly going nowhere,
127

128
00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:00.120
and I went on my backups.
128

129
00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:00.860
So my backups, 
129

130
00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:06.800
there were two, there's innovation hub and innovation
station. I like innovation station or hub, the hub
130

131
00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:08.060
also was pretty good.
131

132
00:08:08.060 --> 00:08:13.460
But if I'm searching by innovation hub, the person
who actually has the name right here is not active.
132

133
00:08:13.910 --> 00:08:15.950
But if I'm searching by innovation hub, the person
who actually has the name right here is not active.
133

134
00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:22.910
They have one post almost four years ago,
and they gave their website.
134

135
00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:23.480
So that was great.
135

136
00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.520
They also gave their names,
136

137
00:08:24.520 --> 00:08:28.460
so it was pretty easy to look them up,
it's some group in Norway.
137

138
00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:31.120
I messaged them, didn't really get a response.
138

139
00:08:31.220 --> 00:08:36.650
I found their website, tried to message their
Contact Us, didn't get a response, so I moved on.
139

140
00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:42.780
What I then did was I went to the one that
I liked, which was called innovation station.
140

141
00:08:42.860 --> 00:08:50.420
And the account was somewhat active, it looked like
the last post was a year and a half ago, and it
141

142
00:08:50.420 --> 00:08:57.260
looked like it was for a playpen area, like someone
made a station for kids to do crafts and stuff like that.
142

143
00:08:57.260 --> 00:08:58.400
looked like it was for a playpen area, like someone
made a station for kids to do crafts and stuff like that.
143

144
00:08:58.450 --> 00:08:59.910
And so I messaged them through the account,
144

145
00:08:59.930 --> 00:09:05.570
nothing happened, as it always seems to be the case, if it's not active, you're not going to get a response, so what I was able
145

146
00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:11.750
to do from their account was figure out that the company
that made this account had another name, and
146

147
00:09:11.750 --> 00:09:20.500
their name was SeeSawDo, and they're in South Africa,
and I kind of looked at their account, what I
147

148
00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:23.390
figured out from their account
was that they do pop up stores.
148

149
00:09:24.130 --> 00:09:26.880
Then what I did was I went to their website.
149

150
00:09:27.130 --> 00:09:34.460
So I just went here to try to figure out if I could see
something about who they were, and use it as an angle to
150

151
00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:39.320
get in contact with them. What I did was I read a
little bit about them, got an idea for how they work,
151

152
00:09:39.370 --> 00:09:46.120
and then I just went to their Contact Us or the Meet
the Team section, that's what it was, and read a little
152

153
00:09:46.120 --> 00:09:49.880
bit about them, figured out what exactly they're doing,
153

154
00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:52.180
who were the co-founders, that was the key thing,
154

155
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:55.530
I figured out that this woman's name,
155

156
00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.820
she was the main person who started it,
156

157
00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.310
and then the other one seems like they came afterwards.
157

158
00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:03.790
So then what I did was, OK, I figured out
this is their name, this is their last name.
158

159
00:10:03.850 --> 00:10:05.220
So then what I did was, OK, I figured out
this is their name, this is their last name.
159

160
00:10:05.380 --> 00:10:10.200
I use a tool called Voila Norbert, which is a prospecting tool.
160

161
00:10:10.210 --> 00:10:13.890
What you do is you plug in someone's first
name, last name, and the domain they're at,
161

162
00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:16.900
and it tries to fetch their email for you.
162

163
00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:21.490
What it does is it just guesses a bunch of different
combinations of e-mails, and it tries to send a
163

164
00:10:21.490 --> 00:10:23.750
fake message to their server.
164

165
00:10:23.830 --> 00:10:26.130
If the e-mail is not correct, it comes back wrong.
165

166
00:10:26.130 --> 00:10:31.690
And if it comes back with the actual answer, then Norbert
says, "Hoorah, we found it." Turns out, we found it,
166

167
00:10:31.710 --> 00:10:33.550
it was actually pretty easy.
167

168
00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.990
It was exactly what you kind of would expect.
168

169
00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:38.140
And you can grab photos of her and her location.
169

170
00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:38.870
Great.
170

171
00:10:38.890 --> 00:10:40.530
Then what I did is I just e-mailed her.
171

172
00:10:40.630 --> 00:10:43.110
I wrote an email, and I'll attach this
in the resources, you can
172

173
00:10:43.130 --> 00:10:48.510
see what I did, and I just messaged
her with the title "Help a stranger?"
173

174
00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:49.410
see what I did, and I just messaged
her with the title "Help a stranger?"
174

175
00:10:49.690 --> 00:10:53.010
She's doing a nonprofit that helps children learn,
175

176
00:10:53.230 --> 00:10:56.780
so I figured that might be something that would resonate.
176

177
00:10:57.040 --> 00:11:03.100
First rule of cold e-mail is that you always talk about
them first, don't ever talk about yourself from
177

178
00:11:03.100 --> 00:11:07.720
the first e-mail, no one likes that from a cold e-mail,
no one wants to read it, and learn about this person
178

179
00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.180
they don't care about or know.
179

180
00:11:09.190 --> 00:11:14.600
So what I did was I talked about them and I said, I
complimented them, I said "I like what you're doing,"
180

181
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:18.970
and I think it was great that they're doing a positive
impact on children's education, which was true,
181

182
00:11:19.010 --> 00:11:24.110
a really cool thing that they're doing, and some
of the pop up stuff is pretty awesome.
182

183
00:11:24.110 --> 00:11:24.580
Then what I did was
183

184
00:11:24.580 --> 00:11:29.430
I said, "Hey, I e-mailed you before," and "You
have this account, you haven't been using it."
184

185
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:31.900
And I just said, "This is what I'm using it for."
185

186
00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.390
And I said I'm teaching it in a class.
186

187
00:11:34.390 --> 00:11:35.750
She's in education,
187

188
00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:40.300
that was kind of the connection there, and then I said,
"Hey, I teach a lot of people, that would be a perfect name
188

189
00:11:40.300 --> 00:11:45.240
to showcase innovation in education,"
which is part of what I'm planning to do.
189

190
00:11:45.560 --> 00:11:46.140
OK.
190

191
00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:52.120
Then what I did was I tried to sweeten the deal by
offering, like, free promotion on the account, or some
191

192
00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:58.780
way of like tying it into my course or something like
that, something like that to make it so that you're
192

193
00:11:58.780 --> 00:12:00.520
not just going out of your way to do something for free.
193

194
00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:04.900
Turns out this person is a nice person, and she just
offered to give it to me, because she said she's not using it.
194

195
00:12:04.900 --> 00:12:05.400
Turns out this person is a nice person, and she just
offered to give it to me, because she said she's not using it.
195

196
00:12:05.410 --> 00:12:08.630
We're both working towards the same goal, which is awesome.
196

197
00:12:08.830 --> 00:12:10.470
And that was pretty much it.
197

198
00:12:10.510 --> 00:12:13.960
So what ended up happening was
I just had to wait like three days,
198

199
00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:19.710
then she got one of her colleagues, I don't know,
someone she works with to free it up for me,
199

200
00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:21.800
and I was able to register.
200

201
00:12:21.940 --> 00:12:28.240
And so now I have @innovationstation, that's what I'm going to
be using throughout this entire course through the follow along.
201

202
00:12:28.600 --> 00:12:29.570
And so now I have @innovationstation, that's what I'm going to
be using throughout this entire course through the follow along.
202

203
00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:30.650
I'm pretty happy with it, it makes sense.
203

204
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.570
I'm pretty happy with it, it makes sense.
204

205
00:12:31.570 --> 00:12:33.000
It's a station, you go, that's where we post innovation.
205

206
00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:34.230
It's a station, you go, that's where we post innovation.
206

207
00:12:34.270 --> 00:12:35.270
It's pretty catchy.
207

208
00:12:35.270 --> 00:12:38.920
It looks good when it's written out, pretty thrilled with that.
208

209
00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:39.430
OK.
209

210
00:12:39.430 --> 00:12:42.080
So if you want to do the same thing, just do what I did.
210

211
00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:47.210
Honestly, if you can't get in contact with them,
go to their website, use an e-mail hunting tool,
211

212
00:12:47.260 --> 00:12:50.060
especially with Voila Norbert, you
can do a free trial, really useful.
212

213
00:12:50.170 --> 00:12:51.040
especially with Voila Norbert, you
can do a free trial, really useful.
213

214
00:12:51.040 --> 00:12:56.290
And then just try to contact them. Personally, I'd suggest
though don't waste too much time on this, because
214

215
00:12:56.380 --> 00:13:01.150
the name is important, but it's not worth
waiting six months to get the perfect name.
215

216
00:13:01.150 --> 00:13:06.620
This took me like two weeks, I think, because I spent a lot
of time with that first one and those goddamn Danish girls.
216

217
00:13:06.640 --> 00:13:07.840
This took me like two weeks, I think, because I spent a lot
of time with that first one and those goddamn Danish girls.
217

218
00:13:07.930 --> 00:13:09.540
I wish I didn't do that. Anyway,
218

219
00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:10.000
OK. So that's what I did.
219

220
00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:11.590
OK. So that's what I did.
220

221
00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:12.610
See you guys next lecture.
