1
00:00:00,180 --> 00:00:07,790
Now what I want to do is just then pick an intro and outro for this text so it slides and it pops in.

2
00:00:07,920 --> 00:00:09,120
Who knows.

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,610
One thing I use pretty frequently are templates.

4
00:00:13,680 --> 00:00:18,030
So there's a lot of companies out there that just make Final Cut Pro templates and they make all sorts

5
00:00:18,030 --> 00:00:22,500
of little widgets and widgets and stuff that just makes the process for you a lot easier.

6
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,050
One of the companies I buy stuff from is called Motian VFX.

7
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:29,520
They have some really nice stuff.

8
00:00:29,520 --> 00:00:30,900
It's not terribly expensive.

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:32,910
You can also find free ones elsewhere.

10
00:00:32,910 --> 00:00:36,590
You also just use on the Final Cut Pro has I mean that's perfectly fine too.

11
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:39,300
I found one a while ago that I find pretty useful.

12
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:46,530
It's called in behavior and it's just a set of behaviors intros outros just odd things that you can

13
00:00:46,530 --> 00:00:48,500
make anything do.

14
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:54,630
And it applies to text files images so you can Bronson's like make something rotate in or rotate on

15
00:00:54,630 --> 00:00:56,200
the Y.

16
00:00:56,270 --> 00:00:58,270
Let's see the intros.

17
00:00:58,560 --> 00:01:04,110
Look in their book and it's there you know do that or whatever.

18
00:01:04,450 --> 00:01:07,140
So now it's just me finding something that works.

19
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,080
I mean you want it to be energetic because it's a video when to keep their attention you just don't

20
00:01:12,110 --> 00:01:17,570
make it a little like tacky by doing something that's way over the top like a blur in.

21
00:01:17,940 --> 00:01:19,210
Yeah that could work.

22
00:01:19,210 --> 00:01:26,370
I usually like a nice slide so often the slides are just so common they just look good just sliding

23
00:01:26,370 --> 00:01:27,570
in from the side very quickly.

24
00:01:27,570 --> 00:01:28,710
It's kind of them in between.

25
00:01:28,710 --> 00:01:34,440
It's like a lot of energy but it's also I mean subtle it's not something that just looks ridiculous

26
00:01:34,440 --> 00:01:35,410
like this one.

27
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:39,900
Or it's like literally says in takes forever or even notice it.

28
00:01:39,900 --> 00:01:47,910
So let me take a screw around with a couple of these and then come back and we'll talk about which one

29
00:01:47,910 --> 00:01:48,640
I chose.

30
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:05,180
OK so I'm just a creature of habit so I use a slide and then I picked out of that behavior kit a exit.

31
00:02:05,390 --> 00:02:11,630
So without editing anything with regards to speeds this is what it should look like.

32
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,490
So it slides in and then it should fade out.

33
00:02:16,490 --> 00:02:24,520
Now what do you have to do these for whatever reason with Final Cut Pro 10 is that you just take this.

34
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:30,470
And then you have to merge it with the object that you want to apply that behavior towards.

35
00:02:30,670 --> 00:02:35,260
So the way you do that is to just pick the two things and then it's usually options.

36
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,230
And you create a new compound clip.

37
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,170
I don't really worry.

38
00:02:40,340 --> 00:02:44,520
Now it's together like this as I go towards the end.

39
00:02:44,630 --> 00:02:47,600
You can see it should fade out.

40
00:02:47,600 --> 00:02:49,180
There you go see it faded out.

41
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,380
I can still modify the speed of the intros and outros.

42
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:56,060
And you just do it a little bit differently.

43
00:02:56,570 --> 00:03:00,990
So you probably.

44
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:06,490
Now if I wanted to change the speed of that fade out I just double click it and now I'm zoomed in and

45
00:03:06,490 --> 00:03:07,810
I can change the fade out here.

46
00:03:07,810 --> 00:03:11,100
So it's actually a pretty slow fade out.

47
00:03:11,350 --> 00:03:15,380
So make it like that and then we'll make this slide and much faster.

48
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:15,850
OK.

49
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:21,830
And I we'll do that because it slides and I like that effect.

50
00:03:21,980 --> 00:03:27,330
That was a little fast and see part of this is you really get to come down to.

51
00:03:27,800 --> 00:03:31,360
How long do you think I need to read this for.

52
00:03:31,460 --> 00:03:31,800
OK.

53
00:03:31,850 --> 00:03:33,380
So now I have it.

54
00:03:33,450 --> 00:03:37,260
Well that's a facile slight and I think that's pretty useful.

55
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:44,490
Now I need to do the same thing with the text itself so often times you can use copy these.

56
00:03:44,690 --> 00:03:46,510
The timing for both of these.

57
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,500
So if you have your snaps on right there it'll automatically snap to the same area.

58
00:03:53,150 --> 00:03:58,520
So it shouldn't look like it's in unison every go so that just pops up like that.

59
00:03:58,940 --> 00:04:00,040
You know what effect you can do that.

60
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,510
I like doing is having it slide in from the side but this won't come up from the bottom since it's not

61
00:04:05,990 --> 00:04:06,800
a big distance.

62
00:04:06,810 --> 00:04:08,670
They have to cover before they touch.

63
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,250
Sometimes I can actually look kind of cool.

64
00:04:10,250 --> 00:04:12,620
So that's one way of doing it.

65
00:04:12,790 --> 00:04:24,390
See and then x adding I want to make it probably shorter.

66
00:04:24,470 --> 00:04:26,010
I think that's pretty good.

67
00:04:26,090 --> 00:04:32,760
And now it's just a matter of like reusing that way of coming in coming out.

68
00:04:32,930 --> 00:04:34,960
Then the question is just can you read that.

69
00:04:34,970 --> 00:04:36,000
Is that fast enough.

70
00:04:36,020 --> 00:04:39,840
So Tinian rasslin is that type of lightweight.

71
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,200
It's not a lot of not a lot of breathing room for some of the people that are maybe a little bit slower

72
00:04:46,200 --> 00:04:47,730
at reading.

73
00:04:47,930 --> 00:04:52,670
So what I have to do going here is to reapply it fade out.

74
00:04:52,670 --> 00:04:56,300
Actually now I can modify a length slightly.

75
00:04:56,560 --> 00:04:58,320
I Here here.

76
00:04:58,650 --> 00:05:00,940
So hopefully this is enough time to read it

77
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,350
I think that's decent enough gives a little bit longer time for it switches.

78
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:11,330
OK.

79
00:05:11,330 --> 00:05:16,980
All right now I need to fix the size of this video to match the square because most video you're going

80
00:05:16,980 --> 00:05:21,650
to get this is a problem you run into you repeatedly is not going to be the right size.

81
00:05:21,650 --> 00:05:23,030
It's like a square.

82
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:30,150
So you have to do is essentially take it out here and then we'll have to increase the size of the background

83
00:05:30,360 --> 00:05:31,580
background.

84
00:05:31,910 --> 00:05:34,230
OK.

85
00:05:34,650 --> 00:05:38,920
So it hits the corners should be better.

86
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:39,700
OK.

87
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:45,000
Yeah especially because it's high enough resolution that should work.

88
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:47,970
It's kind of odd that wobbles like that.

89
00:05:48,090 --> 00:05:51,200
But we can live with it.

90
00:05:51,510 --> 00:05:52,730
OK.

91
00:05:52,920 --> 00:05:54,400
So same thing here.

92
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:55,000
Right.

93
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,250
Well any differences like I might want to just mix it up a little bit.

94
00:05:58,290 --> 00:06:00,270
I might want it to come from a different direction.

95
00:06:00,270 --> 00:06:03,070
So let's first get the image to the right size.

96
00:06:03,140 --> 00:06:06,330
All so for the next one I have to resize this to fit a square.

97
00:06:06,330 --> 00:06:09,420
This is actually a problem because the thing is long right.

98
00:06:09,540 --> 00:06:17,310
So I could go and find another image or I can do a trick that is somewhat commonly done and see this

99
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:19,440
but often as soon as you start looking for it.

100
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:22,750
So you take the image and we want to copy and paste.

101
00:06:22,750 --> 00:06:24,030
So two of them.

102
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:32,370
OK so what can happen is I'm going to take this copy and I'm going to blow it up to the background.

103
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,730
So I take this one and blow it up as background.

104
00:06:36,840 --> 00:06:39,130
So it looks like it's just repeating itself.

105
00:06:39,270 --> 00:06:43,260
And what I can do is I'm going to blur out the background that looks kind of just like an extension

106
00:06:43,260 --> 00:06:44,120
of itself.

107
00:06:44,340 --> 00:06:51,600
And hopefully that will look decent enough that it's not too confusing and it just look kind of like

108
00:06:51,600 --> 00:06:56,100
the ground is continuing hopefully.

109
00:06:56,430 --> 00:06:59,060
But so what you would do is you get to this bottom one.

110
00:06:59,100 --> 00:06:59,530
Right.

111
00:06:59,700 --> 00:07:02,100
So you can see it here in kind of the corner sticking out.

112
00:07:02,370 --> 00:07:04,030
And we're just going to add a bowler to it.

113
00:07:04,050 --> 00:07:07,190
So if you want a blur on Final Cut Pro you figure two effects.

114
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:12,150
So you would think you type in blur and make sure that you've selected all video and audio and you do

115
00:07:12,150 --> 00:07:15,390
this but it's actually just called Gaussian.

116
00:07:15,390 --> 00:07:19,680
They could put blur so that 99 percent of humanity could know how to find this.

117
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:25,460
But again you know software developers so take this and you drag it onto it.

118
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,600
So there it blurs out you kind of see that's blurred.

119
00:07:29,940 --> 00:07:31,410
Probably needs a little bit more though.

120
00:07:31,410 --> 00:07:36,790
So we click this we go up to the inspector window and here is the amount of Parliament Jack that

121
00:07:40,430 --> 00:07:43,690
like it's now kind of looks like we're just highlighting it or something.

122
00:07:44,070 --> 00:07:44,500
OK.

123
00:07:44,550 --> 00:07:48,930
So the next thing we're gonna do is since this is an image like you just don't want us to stare at it

124
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,480
like that would be really boring.

125
00:07:51,780 --> 00:07:55,890
So you probably want to do is just add a little bit of motion.

126
00:07:55,890 --> 00:08:00,480
Now the way you add motion and this is a little more advanced than I think you'll really ever have to

127
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:01,210
deal with.

128
00:08:01,250 --> 00:08:02,820
What better ways of doing this to me honestly.

129
00:08:02,820 --> 00:08:07,600
You can put it in a software called Kim Tasia really easy to do it there if you have a Mac you can use

130
00:08:07,600 --> 00:08:10,100
the thing called Screen flow really easy to do there.

131
00:08:10,130 --> 00:08:15,630
It's a little clunky and final cut pro but again it's because it gives you more control than other ones.

132
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:16,750
They have tools for doing it.

133
00:08:16,750 --> 00:08:20,080
Co-blogger Ken Burns so you can do Ken Burns right there.

134
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:21,320
You say where you want to star.

135
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:22,390
You say you want it.

136
00:08:22,450 --> 00:08:26,620
And so I could do that I could say it like this.

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:33,590
So start slightly out and then we'll do the thought.

138
00:08:33,650 --> 00:08:38,640
Ken Burns this thing like that to that.

139
00:08:38,770 --> 00:08:40,830
So I don't see how this works.

140
00:08:40,970 --> 00:08:45,850
OK so then if you play it it really zooms and see it just like that.

141
00:08:46,220 --> 00:08:46,830
OK.

142
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:48,260
So that's usually good.

143
00:08:48,290 --> 00:08:53,480
I mean it's a cheap and easy way of doing this would you to just take this first starting position and

144
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:57,930
make it the whole frame and then set this to whatever you want.

145
00:08:57,930 --> 00:08:59,200
Now here's a key with this.

146
00:08:59,220 --> 00:09:02,650
Less is more OK when you can burns.

147
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:04,490
Otherwise it's just going to look like watch.

148
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,920
Will you be moving way too fast.

149
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:14,090
I don't know I just I personally think this is kind of weird like you're zooming in that quickly.

150
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,450
So we all do is make it somewhere in between.

151
00:09:20,630 --> 00:09:21,640
OK.

152
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:24,790
I really just don't want to make this easy for you.

153
00:09:31,330 --> 00:09:37,890
So do that and then there is Ken Burns thing back on OK.

154
00:09:37,900 --> 00:09:44,100
Then if I hit play we can see it moves in like that.

155
00:09:44,650 --> 00:09:46,990
I don't know why it starts at such a zoom.

156
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:48,960
That's what's a little odd to me.

157
00:09:48,980 --> 00:09:50,540
But there it goes.

158
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:51,260
OK.

159
00:09:51,370 --> 00:09:53,390
So zoomed in for some reason because of the view.

160
00:09:53,400 --> 00:09:55,330
But then this is what it looks like.

161
00:09:55,330 --> 00:09:58,630
So we're like slowly zooming in on it.

162
00:09:58,710 --> 00:10:03,830
Now alternatively you could just do a pan and slowly move from one side to the other.

163
00:10:03,940 --> 00:10:07,870
That's another way of doing it just kind of depends of what type of emphasis you want to make.

164
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,230
There's nothing makes sense because like you see it now we're moving.

165
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:14,920
And the only thing I would do is I might tweak this just to the Ken Burns thing is again a little more

166
00:10:14,920 --> 00:10:19,370
subtle because I like my can subtle.

167
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:21,830
So like that I think should work pretty well

168
00:10:25,030 --> 00:10:25,860
OK.

169
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:27,040
So there.

170
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:28,670
OK great.

171
00:10:28,710 --> 00:10:35,170
Now what we'll do is we'll throw on our text and we'll make it come in from a different angle.

172
00:10:57,030 --> 00:10:57,280
OK.

173
00:10:57,290 --> 00:11:01,410
So I mean the second one and what I did is I just made it come in from a different direction an accident

174
00:11:01,410 --> 00:11:02,190
a different direction.

175
00:11:02,190 --> 00:11:08,430
So it goes like that.

176
00:11:08,580 --> 00:11:13,380
And so I will just continue on and do the rest of them.

177
00:11:13,410 --> 00:11:16,530
And we'll check back in and to do something different or at the end.

178
00:12:01,670 --> 00:12:02,000
It.

179
00:12:02,110 --> 00:12:09,850
So I've thrown down text pretty much everything so far I think I need to work on now is tightening and

180
00:12:09,910 --> 00:12:10,990
spicing things up.

181
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:14,080
So right now I just have him coming from the same directions and angles.

182
00:12:14,140 --> 00:12:21,370
It's just kind of a manual process now going through and changing it so that they come at different

183
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:27,730
angles and come in different sizes and trying to use different entries and out outros.

184
00:12:27,910 --> 00:12:32,300
You'll notice that I was a little bit of stutter on some of them.

185
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:33,790
You kind of get the gist of it.

186
00:12:33,810 --> 00:12:37,570
So does that keep going.

187
00:12:37,930 --> 00:12:40,990
And here was the final one.

188
00:12:41,230 --> 00:12:46,570
A lot of it also will just come down to timing to seeing whether or not we can add figuring out figure

189
00:12:46,570 --> 00:12:53,320
out a way to display each section or video long enough for you to read it because sometimes it's only

190
00:12:53,320 --> 00:12:55,950
like six words during Sometimes it's two sentences.

191
00:12:55,990 --> 00:12:58,800
So I'm going to do a little bit of the dirty work and I'll be right back.

192
00:13:41,270 --> 00:13:41,610
All right.

193
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:49,010
So what I did was I went through and just did some tweaks I made the text larger in some cases because

194
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:50,350
if you can make it larger That's better.

195
00:13:50,350 --> 00:13:52,440
So it's easier to read.

196
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:54,090
And I moved it around.

197
00:13:54,100 --> 00:13:55,910
OK so then it's there.

198
00:13:55,910 --> 00:14:02,300
Then I did an alternate one put it in the middle and I did another one top and then before I went to

199
00:14:02,300 --> 00:14:10,710
change things lately that when I go in I went to that OK and then I kind of just changed up a little

200
00:14:10,710 --> 00:14:11,180
bit more.

201
00:14:11,180 --> 00:14:18,680
Now it will go through and all mix up the intros and outros and all add transitions from clip to clip.

202
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:20,020
OK you're back.

203
00:15:03,000 --> 00:15:03,310
OK.

204
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:09,370
So what I've done I've gone through and added transitions from the background to give it some motion

205
00:15:09,380 --> 00:15:16,320
so I go from this one to this one did a blur and it comes in and then it falls down and moves into that.

206
00:15:16,340 --> 00:15:18,210
I tried to match these motions up.

207
00:15:18,230 --> 00:15:23,300
So if you had a downward motion coming after like this is coming down then it should be preceded by

208
00:15:23,450 --> 00:15:30,080
a downward mode something that's matching it kind of that kind of symmetry helps you like this swings

209
00:15:30,080 --> 00:15:33,260
to the left wall that one is going right.

210
00:15:33,260 --> 00:15:38,960
That kind of gives it a little more of a seamless feel to it because I did that I felt like there was

211
00:15:38,960 --> 00:15:43,660
enough energy and that would be plenty and it almost made me a more annoying.

212
00:15:43,700 --> 00:15:50,290
So I kind of laid off on the ones up here and so I really just kept to the slides where they just slide

213
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:52,060
in.

214
00:15:52,250 --> 00:15:56,530
So I like that one for instance should probably pop in from the side.

215
00:15:56,630 --> 00:16:07,050
You probably want to do it right and do it right from down down side OK.

216
00:16:07,220 --> 00:16:10,670
But other than that you can see the most part works.

217
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:12,350
I just kind of had to balance the motions.

218
00:16:12,350 --> 00:16:13,850
You don't get seasick.

219
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:16,070
That works.

220
00:16:16,170 --> 00:16:25,260
Now I think the only thing I need to do is add our watermark and that's pretty much it.

221
00:16:25,370 --> 00:16:29,730
And then have this fade out and then add music and we should be done.

222
00:16:29,740 --> 00:16:34,950
Now one little key trick is if you want to me a fade out the easiest way to do that is just to click

223
00:16:35,500 --> 00:16:42,650
control and vi and it'll pop up these options for each element you go composite opacity gace change

224
00:16:42,650 --> 00:16:50,630
all the time line so I can change this to just make it less or more opaque or here and just make it

225
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:51,350
like a fade.

226
00:16:51,350 --> 00:16:53,890
So as it goes it'll start to fade out.

227
00:16:53,900 --> 00:16:56,750
So this is an interesting way of making it exit.

228
00:16:56,750 --> 00:17:01,380
So once the text leaves it lingers for a little bit and then the background leaves.

229
00:17:01,540 --> 00:17:02,070
OK.

230
00:17:02,240 --> 00:17:05,460
So that's one way and kind and accepting and ending it.

231
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:11,400
Realistically I'm going to have some kind of an outro sequence so that in the end it says the Brandur

232
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,690
like whatever it says call the action.

233
00:17:13,700 --> 00:17:15,970
Most likely will say What do you think.

234
00:17:15,980 --> 00:17:21,320
And then I'll have the logo and ask them to comment and they all make that kind of like a brand doable

235
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:21,910
thing.

236
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,690
There's a lot of tweaking that goes into this and over time you'll get better and better and so you

237
00:17:26,690 --> 00:17:30,770
know the first batch of 10 will probably be OK and then they'll all start figuring out what works and

238
00:17:30,770 --> 00:17:32,390
what doesn't kind of go from there.

239
00:17:32,570 --> 00:17:32,790
OK.

240
00:17:32,810 --> 00:17:35,920
So what I'm going to do last up is at our logo

241
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:41,980
and figure out a place to put it.

242
00:17:41,980 --> 00:17:45,100
So I don't want it to stick out too much.

243
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:52,330
But at the same time it shouldn't just look like a smudge on the screen.

244
00:17:52,410 --> 00:17:55,720
So I went to

245
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:03,920
the thing.

246
00:18:04,140 --> 00:18:10,060
They're probably like always put it in the corner like that's how does one technique.

247
00:18:10,070 --> 00:18:14,740
Just a question of how it looks if everything else is moving and it's not.

248
00:18:14,740 --> 00:18:17,140
Do you have to make it match transitions.

249
00:18:17,180 --> 00:18:21,340
I'm not entirely sure we'll see it like that.

250
00:18:24,860 --> 00:18:31,640
Moving so I should probably skirt the opacity and make it a little bit smaller but I think that's a

251
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,850
good way of making people understand that like you're kind of standing by it.

252
00:18:35,850 --> 00:18:40,040
I prefer to have the innovation station but that would take a little more tweaking to make sure that

253
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:41,150
you could read it.

254
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,750
So I'm not really going to do that right now.

255
00:18:43,750 --> 00:18:46,040
I think this is a good alternate plan.

256
00:18:46,160 --> 00:18:53,540
We put it a little smaller that will play with the capacity of going to video the inspector and bring

257
00:18:53,540 --> 00:18:59,660
it down a little bit so it looks more like a watermark right like a watermark.

258
00:18:59,930 --> 00:19:01,250
It's like slight.

259
00:19:01,260 --> 00:19:04,640
It shouldn't be a stamp.

260
00:19:04,810 --> 00:19:08,060
You can bring it down even further and see how that looks.

261
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,340
It's like that I think pretty good.

262
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,590
Don't bring it down slowly.

263
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:23,620
That's about it.

264
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:31,280
The only thing I see conflicting with is this one little clip where I can just tweak this slightly

265
00:19:34,410 --> 00:19:34,680
OK.

266
00:19:34,700 --> 00:19:36,490
Now I need to grab music.

267
00:19:36,670 --> 00:19:37,820
You get music.

268
00:19:37,820 --> 00:19:43,010
YouTube has a great fantastic royalty free section.

269
00:19:43,130 --> 00:19:46,990
There's a lot of stuff in Final Cut Pro.

270
00:19:47,090 --> 00:19:53,120
I personally like to use things like audio jungle and sometimes I'll use things like the Vado market

271
00:19:53,180 --> 00:19:53,710
like this.

272
00:19:53,730 --> 00:19:56,710
See right here that's also a pretty useful one.

273
00:19:56,710 --> 00:19:59,380
So let's see.

274
00:19:59,390 --> 00:20:02,850
So we just want something science see.

275
00:20:03,140 --> 00:20:05,670
So let me think we'll come back to it.

276
00:20:05,710 --> 00:20:05,980
OK.

277
00:20:05,990 --> 00:20:13,900
So we'll take it for you on YouTube and just search you to royalty free.

278
00:20:13,940 --> 00:20:18,840
They have a channel that you go and call this library usually.

279
00:20:19,220 --> 00:20:22,230
So audio library no copyright music.

280
00:20:22,310 --> 00:20:27,200
Now I'm just hoping because something happy that matches and we're all about innovation and changing

281
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,180
the world go or something.

282
00:20:32,190 --> 00:20:37,470
You know happy music or even full Philip

283
00:20:43,780 --> 00:20:43,950
that

284
00:20:52,690 --> 00:20:53,730
I think this a work.

285
00:20:53,950 --> 00:20:57,970
So you do as you go down to the link it shows you read it download it

286
00:21:00,660 --> 00:21:11,090
and channel subscription so you can confirm in order to download it.

287
00:21:11,110 --> 00:21:20,680
Now that I've downloaded it I go and open it up look for the three and just drag and drop that in three

288
00:21:20,770 --> 00:21:26,130
or there and drag it and put it somewhere underneath everything there.

289
00:21:26,380 --> 00:21:33,490
OK so now I have music go back.

290
00:21:34,270 --> 00:21:35,420
OK.

291
00:21:35,610 --> 00:21:39,350
Generally you just want to make it quiet enough that you can hear it enough that it's distracting.

292
00:21:39,350 --> 00:21:43,510
On Instagram you can make it a little bit louder than you would think since it's kind of carrying it.

293
00:21:43,550 --> 00:21:46,570
And so no one talking someone's talking you have to be pretty quiet.

294
00:21:46,570 --> 00:21:51,580
So right I think this works.

295
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:57,580
So last thing to do is just clip off the end and make sure that we snap it go.

296
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:03,740
And I think that should do it.

297
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,850
Should you get rid of any extra little bits.

298
00:22:06,970 --> 00:22:08,310
OK.

299
00:22:08,900 --> 00:22:17,750
So about 28 seconds in total and you can save it as an a good movie.

300
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:21,330
Pump that out which should be good to go.

301
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:21,750
OK.

302
00:22:21,780 --> 00:22:28,140
So all attached this in the resources you can see what I made and keep in mind as we go through this.

303
00:22:28,170 --> 00:22:34,220
I'm going to improve on this when I play it the Fontina play with the colors and deploy with the branding.

304
00:22:34,560 --> 00:22:39,270
I might even work with some templates but I'll show you pretty much everything that we do.

305
00:22:39,270 --> 00:22:45,440
So you're not going to be missing any steps that took about an hour for me to do.

306
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,430
And since I was the first time I done that that kind of makes sense.

307
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:55,080
But in the future I would imagine you take me closer to 30 minutes especially if I start having the

308
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:59,970
same patterns that it's just dragging and dropping and end when we get to automation that's when it

309
00:22:59,970 --> 00:23:02,260
really starts to take off and I'll show you what I do.

310
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:02,650
OK.

311
00:23:02,670 --> 00:23:05,910
So hopefully that was somewhat interesting not entirely too boring.

312
00:23:05,940 --> 00:23:06,630
See you next lecture.
