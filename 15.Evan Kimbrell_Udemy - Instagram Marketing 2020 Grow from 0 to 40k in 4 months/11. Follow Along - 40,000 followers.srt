00:00:00,330 --> 00:00:01,810
Hey guys checking in.

2
00:00:01,890 --> 00:00:04,890
We are now at 40000 followers.

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:12,180
So that is a bit of a milestone of sorts because Shoot-In for fifty thousand point I will get my foot

4
00:00:12,180 --> 00:00:14,810
off the gas and stop caring about this.

5
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,400
But so far since we last checked in really not much has happened.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:22,720
Honestly I've really put this on autopilot.

7
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:28,800
I'm not really doing anything other than trolling people in the comments just getting them to respond

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,940
more then that's really it.

9
00:00:31,950 --> 00:00:35,060
I mean we've started recycling most of our posts.

10
00:00:35,070 --> 00:00:36,420
You can see right here.

11
00:00:36,470 --> 00:00:42,340
I think we have a pretty weak list of innovations we've found.

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:47,030
And for the most part our really just digging out of the post we've had before.

13
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,720
You see over here these are some ones we flagged that were high performing.

14
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:57,750
I think what I'll do in the future is start flagging not only the high performing ones but the ones

15
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:01,950
that people repeatedly ask about buying.

16
00:01:01,950 --> 00:01:07,320
So like for instance the foil Yeah it's this thing that it's like a surfboard that holds you up over

17
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:10,670
the water and people are pretty excited about it.

18
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:14,100
And I think the price wise it's something that we could probably sell.

19
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:19,050
So I think when we get to the point where we're going to start monetizing this account this might be

20
00:01:19,050 --> 00:01:20,150
one of the things we explore.

21
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:27,340
We start focusing more on these low to medium priced items that seem to get a lot of attention.

22
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:29,490
And we already established that people are interested in them.

23
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:37,020
So it's really a matter of putting a link like an affiliate link to buy this whenever we post it or

24
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:42,180
trying to do an image post and have them shop through the image.

25
00:01:42,220 --> 00:01:43,410
I'm not really sure.

26
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:48,030
It's a little bit hard to do this with the video so I'm honestly kind of just waiting for Instagram

27
00:01:48,030 --> 00:01:54,420
to come out with some way to sell from videos which should be happening any day now.

28
00:01:54,470 --> 00:01:57,080
Seems like they're kind of missing an opportunity with that.

29
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:02,170
But again they're you know shop on instruments something they've only relatively recently rolled out.

30
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,470
So check out our stats as we're doing right now.

31
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,770
You know for the most part nothing really much has changed.

32
00:02:10,070 --> 00:02:12,660
Pretty steady growth.

33
00:02:12,660 --> 00:02:19,050
If you look at our data days notice that snowballing effect that I mentioned a lot it's really gotten

34
00:02:19,050 --> 00:02:24,000
to a point where it's just hard to have days below 200.

35
00:02:24,010 --> 00:02:30,690
You know I think the last one I had was like two weeks ago and there's a couple right there but they're

36
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:34,310
just getting more less and less frequent.

37
00:02:34,320 --> 00:02:39,690
It seems that without doing anything we are getting up in the 300.

38
00:02:39,690 --> 00:02:46,350
So what I've noticed is more often when I'm posting they'll notice when it says views.

39
00:02:46,350 --> 00:02:51,660
How many people will view it and there's a huge disparity between the average post.

40
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,910
We do so like this one for instance I can't remember it says eight thousand views because it's not so

41
00:02:56,910 --> 00:03:04,980
bad but this seventy seven thousand and didn't do anything to this post at all I just a lot of people

42
00:03:05,130 --> 00:03:06,090
talking about it.

43
00:03:06,160 --> 00:03:08,630
I posted this probably three or four times now.

44
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,360
But yeah there's just a lot of those that seemed to do really well like these are ok.

45
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,090
Blah.

46
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,800
Ok this one did a lot better.

47
00:03:15,900 --> 00:03:20,730
This one for some reason just got a lot of people talking about it is basically people saying it's their

48
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:26,370
autonomous cargo ships and it's just people saying like I'm just going to rob them or whatever which

49
00:03:26,550 --> 00:03:27,800
might be a valid point.

50
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:29,580
But really it's not that original.

51
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:36,720
Yeah I mean the image posts for the most part are doing as poorly as ever and never really a big part

52
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:37,770
of the account strategy.

53
00:03:37,770 --> 00:03:43,510
It's just kind of a way to flex with the limited content so that we could have extra things to post.

54
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,760
And also just kind of gives it the stripe which I think is still pretty memorable We might even switch

55
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,960
honestly to just doing videos and are really now doing it.

56
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:54,470
Like for instance tech with tech junction is one of them.

57
00:03:54,750 --> 00:03:55,820
So there's a cow.

58
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:02,220
This is kind of the way that if I wanted to go as low as possible I could grow a lot faster and just

59
00:04:02,220 --> 00:04:03,940
do what these people do.

60
00:04:03,960 --> 00:04:06,330
This guy basically has like five of these accounts.

61
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:07,560
They all point at each other.

62
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,000
They all just share the same exact stuff and it's all just click baiting nonsense.

63
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:14,550
Most of these are actually not even real.

64
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,880
They are usually things that rely on video special effects to make it look like it's real like he post

65
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,390
a lot of these things that just have been debunked and they're not real like this.

66
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:24,710
OK.

67
00:04:24,730 --> 00:04:27,640
You know that doesn't work.

68
00:04:27,740 --> 00:04:34,800
They kind of stuck with the really click Baty stuff that is mostly fake or is just designed for the

69
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:36,220
lowest common denominator.

70
00:04:36,300 --> 00:04:42,090
Yeah I could probably grow a lot faster but I'm trying to keep the brand at least above water.

71
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:47,090
I think the idea is later on we start doing shout outs or selling shout outs or selling features.

72
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,960
People aren't going to want to be featured on one of these accounts that just posts the absolute garbage

73
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:53,790
of the garbage that just gets attention.

74
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,080
All those things are worth pointing out.

75
00:04:55,230 --> 00:05:02,850
We have a week or so gotten three or four people asking features I'm still in that phase where it's

76
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,350
the Kenelm's getting large enough that it's getting attention and people want to be featured but it's

77
00:05:07,710 --> 00:05:11,090
to the point where I'm not sure that what I can charge is worth it.

78
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:15,330
You know I've had one person say yes for $150 and then it was just a matter of trying to still trying

79
00:05:15,330 --> 00:05:16,340
to figure it out.

80
00:05:16,610 --> 00:05:20,370
I have had a couple other companies ask seems to be pretty popular with Kickstarter.

81
00:05:20,370 --> 00:05:25,740
So if you're going to do a technology Kickstarter they always seem to you know hassle me about getting

82
00:05:25,740 --> 00:05:27,390
a post for their kickstarter.

83
00:05:27,420 --> 00:05:28,700
Really just depends on what it was.

84
00:05:28,710 --> 00:05:32,190
You know I think we had one today that was a modular desk.

85
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:33,000
OK.

86
00:05:33,210 --> 00:05:38,220
I don't know I mean novel ish I don't know if I could really do much with that.

87
00:05:38,220 --> 00:05:38,430
All right.

88
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:44,970
So anyway I think I've said this over and over again but I'm not going to do much on this account.

89
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:46,950
It's going to continue to grow.

90
00:05:47,130 --> 00:05:48,510
We'll continue to do.

91
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:49,380
Shout for shout.

92
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,040
I think we did two or three this week.

93
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:53,160
They were pretty easy.

94
00:05:53,160 --> 00:05:58,200
They are all from the automated outreach that I've been doing we still have an excel sheet going or

95
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:04,230
just kind of marking them out as we go down and you know for the most part it ends up working maybe

96
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:06,430
20 percent of the accounts so a message.

97
00:06:06,570 --> 00:06:13,200
So that's promising but you know again we're at 40000 So a shout for shower isn't as valuable as it's

98
00:06:13,200 --> 00:06:16,380
going to be in or at 200000 or something more significant.

99
00:06:16,380 --> 00:06:20,810
All right guys so with that being said if something new changes I will check in soon.

100
00:06:20,820 --> 00:06:23,290
But otherwise I'll see you guys at 50 K.

101
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:23,790
All right.

102
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:24,370
See you then.
