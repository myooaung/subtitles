1
00:00:00,370 --> 00:00:01,830
All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,830 --> 00:00:06,690
So in this picture we're going to talk about the number two way of monetizing your Instagram account

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,630
and that is selling products.

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:10,630
Now we're talking about selling products.

5
00:00:10,680 --> 00:00:13,830
We essentially have one of two different ways of doing this.

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,300
Now the first route is what I call easy mode and that's through affiliate marketing.

7
00:00:18,300 --> 00:00:22,170
If you're not familiar with affiliate marketing it basically means you're going to sell other people's

8
00:00:22,170 --> 00:00:27,840
products on whatever system you have for generating traffic which in this case is an Instagram account

9
00:00:27,930 --> 00:00:31,560
when you sell other people's products through an affiliate relationship you typically will just get

10
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:38,460
paid a flat amount per sale or per lead or sometimes you get a percentage of everything the person that

11
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:41,970
you refer to them buys the case of affiliate marketing.

12
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:45,190
It is pretty easy because you don't have to make the product.

13
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,740
You don't have to do the customer service.

14
00:00:46,740 --> 00:00:48,060
You don't have to do the logistics.

15
00:00:48,060 --> 00:00:49,130
You don't have to fulfillment.

16
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:51,590
You don't have to do anything besides selling it.

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:53,910
Once they buy it you're pretty much off the hook.

18
00:00:53,910 --> 00:00:56,660
Now a second way is to sell your own stuff.

19
00:00:56,730 --> 00:01:01,130
And if you're going to sell your own stuff you probably already have a product already.

20
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,070
I wouldn't necessarily say go and make a product just for Instagram account because that's actually

21
00:01:05,070 --> 00:01:06,130
the hard part.

22
00:01:06,250 --> 00:01:08,850
I think making the Instagram account is easy.

23
00:01:08,910 --> 00:01:14,370
In this case you do have to come up with your own stuff and hopefully you've already done that but you

24
00:01:14,370 --> 00:01:20,790
don't have to say build your own massive software suite in order to make this work.

25
00:01:20,790 --> 00:01:25,470
There's a lot of simpler things you can sell and I would also look into things like drop shipping where

26
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,590
you effectively it's like an affiliate relationship except you take over a little bit more control of

27
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:32,550
the stuff you're selling.

28
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,610
Now this is actually where we're going to do is we're going to talk about that first option the easy

29
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:39,050
mode doing affiliate marketing through your Instagram account.

30
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,830
First you need to decide what you want to sell and would look at what your options are or how to find

31
00:01:43,830 --> 00:01:45,280
things that fit your account.

32
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,040
And also we'll talk a little bit about how the mechanics of affiliate relationships work because the

33
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:52,320
first thing is you just have to ask yourself the question.

34
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,040
Do you have your own products to sell should be an easy question to answer.

35
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,370
And the answer is No but you still think your account could be a great platform for selling something.

36
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:03,720
Well then the affiliate strategy is probably the way you ought to go.

37
00:02:03,720 --> 00:02:09,360
Let's say for the sake of example you have an account that highlights really nice shoes.

38
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:09,660
Right.

39
00:02:09,660 --> 00:02:11,940
And your main audience are things like sneaker heads.

40
00:02:11,940 --> 00:02:13,790
There are a lot of accounts out there.

41
00:02:13,790 --> 00:02:19,950
There's an entire mass of people who are obsessed with shoes and spend a lot of their disposable income

42
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:20,580
on shoes.

43
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:26,940
Now in this case you always make your own shoes that would take hundreds of hours of know how and manufacturing

44
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:32,970
and design and marketing or set or you know you just look for another company has done all of that and

45
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:35,000
then see if you can set up an affiliate relationship.

46
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:38,940
Now typically affiliate programs work like this.

47
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:44,160
There's usually a company that has already decided that Affiliate Marketing is a possibility for getting

48
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,620
the word out there about their products and so they've set up a system or signed up for an exchange

49
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:54,720
that allows them to have people see the products they're willing to sell.

50
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:55,770
Sign up for it.

51
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:00,510
Agree to some terms so that they have some limits on how they can advertise their stuff so they're not

52
00:03:00,510 --> 00:03:06,480
doing it in a terrible terrible way and then it gives them the logistics for how Actually can I send

53
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,680
traffic to this site.

54
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,350
Usually it's through like a link and then how can I track who actually buys from that link.

55
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:18,930
Now for our purposes we really want to look for affiliate programs that use links there's other ways

56
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:21,790
of doing affiliate programs like cookies.

57
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:25,290
And that's just a nightmare because it's not going really going to work on Instagram.

58
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,360
You don't know what mobile browser people are using.

59
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:30,350
It's just not ideal.

60
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,590
We want to look for someone who's just going to give us a very simple link and that link automatically

61
00:03:34,590 --> 00:03:39,550
tracks the activity that user does once they hit the actual destination page.

62
00:03:39,570 --> 00:03:42,150
Once you have a link it's actually pretty simple.

63
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:44,850
All you have to do is take that link and put it in your bio.

64
00:03:44,880 --> 00:03:48,030
It's like a generic thing that you always want to be selling.

65
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:53,370
Or you can coordinate it with your actual post say you do a post of a really popular shoe and then say

66
00:03:53,370 --> 00:03:58,260
link in the bio and then you change your bio to a link to that specific shoe.

67
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,150
Now let's say we are the theoretical shoe company how exactly would we find an affiliate program of

68
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:03,710
shoes.

69
00:04:03,750 --> 00:04:06,950
Well like all things in the world it always just starts at Google.

70
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,780
So we can just say shoe or research for affiliate programs right there.

71
00:04:12,030 --> 00:04:12,350
OK.

72
00:04:12,360 --> 00:04:14,070
Now here's a bunch right.

73
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:21,030
There's a bunch of companies that sell a lot of shoes like hotter shoes Clarkes those are really sandals

74
00:04:21,030 --> 00:04:23,600
and boots I think vans.

75
00:04:23,640 --> 00:04:26,880
And let's just say shoes dot com I think this one's actually interesting.

76
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,260
It's also interesting cause you can see there's backslash or as affiliates trains they already have

77
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:37,250
a page set up dedicated to affiliates so they already have their thing well set up.

78
00:04:37,290 --> 00:04:39,010
So let's just take out shoes.

79
00:04:39,480 --> 00:04:45,060
You know she's kind of like Zappos they have just tens of thousands of different shoes so if you were

80
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:48,960
someone who likes to highlight a variety of different types of shoes maybe this is something that you

81
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:55,680
might actually tackle because they can cater to anybody and it's very easy for you to find something

82
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:59,510
on their site that would fit with whatever you want to highlight at the moment.

83
00:04:59,590 --> 00:05:03,740
So right here it has the basic information about their affiliate program.

84
00:05:03,760 --> 00:05:08,090
So it says by affiliate program is fantastic wader and Rabaul the bubble boy.

85
00:05:08,140 --> 00:05:13,780
Now they say the terms of it so 9 percent commissions I means you link to them that buy something you

86
00:05:13,780 --> 00:05:15,360
get 9 percent of whatever they buy.

87
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,990
A three year cookie window which basically means that if that person goes to choose the outcome and

88
00:05:19,990 --> 00:05:22,560
they buy something the next three days you get credited for that.

89
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:29,530
But if they buy it on the fourth day then choose dagum likes think that that was not necessarily attributable

90
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:30,430
to you.

91
00:05:30,430 --> 00:05:34,100
I think three three day cookie window is pretty conservative.

92
00:05:34,170 --> 00:05:39,570
There's ones that give you a much better one even like 14 day 30 day affiliate windows.

93
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:42,200
Then we have monthly payments and dedicated affiliate support.

94
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:42,870
OK.

95
00:05:43,030 --> 00:05:47,680
Now the way they do it here is sign off now you say Click here to sign up via link share and this is

96
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:55,510
a very popular affiliate marketing exchange and they basically give software to these companies that

97
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:00,520
want to have affiliate relationships and they do all the tracking and all the payouts and everything

98
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:02,500
like that so it makes their life easier.

99
00:06:02,500 --> 00:06:05,300
So if I wanted to sign up I'd sign of as a publisher.

100
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:07,930
And you have to give them up.

101
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:14,890
Obviously a lot of information and you'll have to be pretty careful to read through their requirements

102
00:06:14,890 --> 00:06:17,650
on where you can advertise some of them are very strict.

103
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:21,780
Some of them don't really care like shoes dot com I would imagine probably not currently care.

104
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:26,020
Once you fill this out then it's just a waiting period.

105
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,290
You know with Link share it's like two to three business days for you'll get a response.

106
00:06:30,460 --> 00:06:34,680
Some affiliate programs are really picky about who they use and some really don't care.

107
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:39,400
They just want to make sure that you're not a porn site that's posting their shoes on it.

108
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:43,860
So you would just fill this out and then submit it and then wait a couple of days.

109
00:06:43,870 --> 00:06:49,120
It's pretty simple once you have that set up then it's a matter of just setting up your bank details

110
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:50,080
how you want to get paid.

111
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,280
Oftentimes it's through paypal and then getting your share link your Sharron Angle kind of looks like

112
00:06:54,280 --> 00:06:58,970
a bitty link but it will have like linked links share in it.

113
00:06:59,050 --> 00:07:04,750
And typically I like to take those and then put them in a bitty wrapper so that it doesn't look like

114
00:07:04,750 --> 00:07:09,690
I'm giving you a link to an affiliate program link shares common enough that a lot of people recognize

115
00:07:09,690 --> 00:07:11,320
that and action might hurt your conversions.

116
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:11,630
OK.

117
00:07:11,650 --> 00:07:18,010
Now what would you do if you didn't know what you wanted to sell it might not be the case that your

118
00:07:18,010 --> 00:07:19,390
account is that targeted.

119
00:07:19,390 --> 00:07:23,850
So it's not obviously the case you're going to go after shoes or something really specific.

120
00:07:24,040 --> 00:07:28,940
What if you think you could sell a lot of different things and you just kind of want to see what's available.

121
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:34,600
Well what you have to do is go and browse through affiliate marketplaces or affiliate exchanges and

122
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:39,170
there's a whole whole bunch of them link shares one of them but we'll just look at two.

123
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:45,970
One is called offer vault and the other one is called old digger which a terrible name.

124
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,100
But what happens here is they list off affiliate deals all over the universe.

125
00:07:51,100 --> 00:07:58,210
And so in the case of Degger they just aggregate them and then they pass you off to another affiliate

126
00:07:58,210 --> 00:07:59,920
exchange case of offer.

127
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:01,530
That's also kind of the same thing.

128
00:08:01,570 --> 00:08:05,440
But a lot of times they give you good leads as to where another network is if you look through their

129
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:07,120
entire thing and you can't learn anything you want.

130
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:12,040
And the reason why I like Oger could offer of all is because they're aggregators so they pull in affiliate

131
00:08:12,070 --> 00:08:17,230
deals from all different types of networks and that's kind of important because if you're flexible on

132
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,440
what you can sell then you're probably going to want a lot of variety.

133
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:22,600
And also you might change frequently.

134
00:08:22,630 --> 00:08:27,910
And so if they aggregate all across then you have a broader view of what's available what's hot and

135
00:08:27,910 --> 00:08:30,200
what's giving really good offers right now.

136
00:08:30,310 --> 00:08:33,580
Número shoes are calling it nine percent of everything you sell on a three day window.

137
00:08:33,590 --> 00:08:39,340
Well there are products out there that will give you 50 percent or 75 percent or even just a flat fee

138
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,170
for even something like a Sign-Up form.

139
00:08:41,170 --> 00:08:45,730
So keep in mind the grass is often greener on the other side.

140
00:08:45,730 --> 00:08:48,190
There's always another deal that's just waiting around the corner.

141
00:08:48,190 --> 00:08:52,540
So in ogre's case let's say we wanted to look at shoes and see what they have.

142
00:08:52,540 --> 00:08:54,300
All right let's see what we got.

143
00:08:54,400 --> 00:08:58,930
So it looks like they're offering a lot of things for apps that sell shoes like Net shoes I believe

144
00:08:58,930 --> 00:09:00,760
that's an app that sells it.

145
00:09:00,790 --> 00:09:05,460
There's also an android one Laza Laura it's a fashion and shopping for Android.

146
00:09:05,470 --> 00:09:08,940
So what these would be are you would sign up for them.

147
00:09:08,950 --> 00:09:13,420
And every time you get someone to sign up for their app you get paid which is a pretty low barrier.

148
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:19,430
So like let's see net shoes Paisley 66 cents every time someone signs up.

149
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:20,890
So you know I don't know.

150
00:09:20,890 --> 00:09:28,000
It kind of depends on how interesting you think the actual offer is and how well you think it will converge.

151
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:30,490
But that is generally speaking better offers out there.

152
00:09:30,490 --> 00:09:35,080
One thing that is kind of nice about oh digger's they'll give you a preview of what the landing page

153
00:09:35,080 --> 00:09:35,820
looks like.

154
00:09:35,860 --> 00:09:42,800
And so in this case when you use that link in your bio you can see the page that will actually land.

155
00:09:42,820 --> 00:09:48,770
Let's say you have an account dedicated to beards or like manliness or hygiene or something like that.

156
00:09:48,790 --> 00:09:50,490
Like here's one better beard club.

157
00:09:50,530 --> 00:09:51,250
OK.

158
00:09:51,250 --> 00:09:58,870
They offer you $40 per action which I believe is if they sign up for a trial because they know that

159
00:09:59,020 --> 00:10:01,480
average trial buyer you know pays a certain amount.

160
00:10:01,480 --> 00:10:03,850
So $40 is pretty good.

161
00:10:03,850 --> 00:10:06,010
We can click here and just check out the landing page.

162
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:11,200
This way we can see whether or not it's something that actually matches with our count what they're

163
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:11,620
selling.

164
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:13,240
So it's not to sales.

165
00:10:13,270 --> 00:10:15,060
Now here's the easy little pack.

166
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,490
What to make sure that anybody we linked to is mobile optimized.

167
00:10:18,490 --> 00:10:23,960
Why I shouldn't have to explain this if you go to that site and it's not very easy to use on your phone.

168
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:27,190
It doesn't matter what they're offering you're not going to get a lot of conversions so if you're just

169
00:10:27,190 --> 00:10:32,970
using like chrome or anything just grab the bottom and then just see how it looks when you shrink it.

170
00:10:33,130 --> 00:10:33,450
Right.

171
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:36,780
This is very similar to the screen you might see on like an iPhone 10.

172
00:10:36,890 --> 00:10:42,370
And OK look like it's it automatically resizes the buttons are big it's easy to tell what they're selling.

173
00:10:42,370 --> 00:10:43,000
Cool.

174
00:10:43,150 --> 00:10:44,660
So I've already done that.

175
00:10:44,890 --> 00:10:47,920
And then the rest of it might just be checking out what it is they sell and it looks like they sell

176
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,470
these trial packages for grooming and for beards.

177
00:10:51,460 --> 00:10:53,370
There's a lot of people out there really obsessive beards.

178
00:10:53,380 --> 00:10:57,510
I think this is a little weird they sell beer booze which is testosterone.

179
00:10:57,580 --> 00:10:59,160
I always thought that was regulated.

180
00:10:59,170 --> 00:11:00,520
But who knows.

181
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:02,620
Anyway so make that decision on your own.

182
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:07,780
Now one other affiliate exchange I just want to point out and this is a great one if you're willing

183
00:11:07,780 --> 00:11:13,600
to sell physical products to Amazon Amazon largest store online in the world.

184
00:11:13,810 --> 00:11:19,090
So if you can't find something you sell on Amazon then well you're struggling here if you just want

185
00:11:19,090 --> 00:11:21,400
to get affiliate Dasch program on Amazon.

186
00:11:21,430 --> 00:11:27,490
You can work with them and then get something like 10 percent I think is the commission for virtually

187
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:33,940
anything you can find on Amazon so honestly there's so many things you could sell on here that you shouldn't

188
00:11:33,940 --> 00:11:35,470
have a lot of trouble finding it.

189
00:11:35,470 --> 00:11:40,390
Now keep in mind since Amazon is huge they have a lot of leverage over their affiliates so their deals

190
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:46,750
are not going to be as sexy as say like a smaller nice site that really desperately wants to win over

191
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:47,750
some good affiliates.

192
00:11:47,770 --> 00:11:51,760
When you find an exchange that you like you basically just sign up and then follow their instructions

193
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,980
for signing up for a deal and eventually you'll end up with an approval on a link and that's pretty

194
00:11:56,980 --> 00:11:58,030
much a rinse and repeat.

195
00:11:58,030 --> 00:12:00,350
Now in the next year we're going to do a cover.

196
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:04,750
One of the newer features on Instagram and that is shareable by Instagram.

197
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:09,360
I'm going to talk about how we can make that apply for products that we sell on our own.

198
00:12:09,490 --> 00:12:09,810
OK.

199
00:12:09,850 --> 00:12:10,350
See you then.
