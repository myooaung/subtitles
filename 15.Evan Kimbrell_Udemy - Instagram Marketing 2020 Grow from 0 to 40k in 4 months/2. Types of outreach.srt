Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:07,680
So this section, what we're doing is we're covering
automated or semi-automated outreach strategies
2

3
00:00:08,040 --> 00:00:09,380
for growing your account.
3

4
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:14,480
Now, when we talk about outreach strategies, you
could outreach to people for a lot of different things.
4

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:20,720
You could outreach people to sell them something,
to try to get them to follow a different account.
5

6
00:00:21,060 --> 00:00:26,670
In this section, we're going to talk about how to
outreach specifically for collaboration posts.
6

7
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:31,650
Now, with Instagram, when we talk about collaboration posts,
kind of the gold standard is what we call the shout for shout.
7

8
00:00:31,650 --> 00:00:32,750
Now, with Instagram, when we talk about collaboration posts,
kind of the gold standard is what we call the shout for shout.
8

9
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:39,270
You know what shoutouts are, we looked at those before,
but shout for shouts are effectively where you trade
9

10
00:00:39,300 --> 00:00:45,360
shoutouts with accounts that have similar themes,
similar audiences, and ideally, similar follower counts.
10

11
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:50,760
We're currently in an Instagram trend where
Instagram, because it's owned by Facebook,
11

12
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,070
they're kind of reeling from Facebook getting in trouble
with some of the ways that they allow businesses
12

13
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:57,870
to spread their information.
13

14
00:00:57,900 --> 00:01:01,720
*How do you sustain a business model in
which users don't pay for your service?*
14

15
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:12,480
*-Senator, we run ads. 
-I see.* 
There used to be the case that Facebook and Instagram
were very business friendly, as in you're trying
15

16
00:01:12,480 --> 00:01:13,450
to grow your account,
16

17
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,350
okay, we'll show your stuff to all sorts of people.
17

18
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:19,940
But now Facebook's kind of reeling that back,
18

19
00:01:20,030 --> 00:01:22,280
Instagram is following the same tact,
19

20
00:01:22,440 --> 00:01:27,750
they're trying to make it such that now they really
only want to show people information from friends
20

21
00:01:27,750 --> 00:01:30,140
and family or accounts they already follow.
21

22
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:34,710
So as a business owner or someone who's trying to
use this for business means, that actually is quite
22

23
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:36,450
a bit more difficult.
23

24
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,010
If you have been following our follow along sections, you probably noticed that it used to be the case where we posted something,
24

25
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:44,930
like 75% of our views were from non-followers,
25

26
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:48,360
now it's more like 25%, if you're lucky.
26

27
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,440
So that means that we're operating in our own little
echo chamber, so when we post something, for the
27

28
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:58,530
most part, it really only goes to our followers, and
that getting an introduction or exposure to someone
28

29
00:01:58,530 --> 00:02:01,110
else's followers becomes that much more important.
29

30
00:02:01,110 --> 00:02:03,690
That's the only way we can pierce
these little bubbles we're in.
30

31
00:02:03,690 --> 00:02:06,730
So what type of shout for shouts are there?
31

32
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,880
Well, really kind of falls down into three different
categories. One, we have traditional post shoutouts,
32

33
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:14,970
and that's really what everyone used to do.
33

34
00:02:14,970 --> 00:02:17,010
You'd say "Hey, want to do a shoutout?"
34

35
00:02:17,010 --> 00:02:19,360
And then they would say "Yes, let's do it."
35

36
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,250
Here's a post,
36

37
00:02:20,250 --> 00:02:26,250
here's a post, you trade posts, and then you coordinate
when to post it, and then you try to obviously even
37

38
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:30,540
it out such that maybe, if one account is smaller than
the other, they post twice and the other posts once.
38

39
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:31,330
it out such that maybe, if one account is smaller than
the other, they post twice and the other posts once.
39

40
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:36,090
Really it's just a relationship game. But we
have other options available to us as well.
40

41
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,070
The other one is story shoutouts, which are the same
exact thing, but you're using stories, and that simplifies
41

42
00:02:41,070 --> 00:02:46,290
things quite a bit, because we don't have to negotiate
how long the post is going to be up anymore.
42

43
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:50,130
We also don't have to really coordinate as much
as before, because if we do a post, it would be like,
43

44
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:50,380
Okay, you going to post something, I'm going to post
something, you'd wait for the other person to post it,
44

45
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,960
Okay, you going to post something, I'm going to post
something, you'd wait for the other person to post it,
45

46
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:58,380
then you post it, or you try to set up the same exact
time that you're going to post it. With a story,
46

47
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:01,200
you know if you post it, it's
automatically going to be 24 hours,
47

48
00:03:01,350 --> 00:03:04,350
and if they tag you, you automatically know it's there.
48

49
00:03:04,350 --> 00:03:09,210
So as long as they get it within that same 24 hour
window that you've originally posted, it's pretty
49

50
00:03:09,210 --> 00:03:12,220
easy to meet that basic rule of reciprocity.
50

51
00:03:12,220 --> 00:03:17,040
Then of course we do have true collaboration posts,
and that's really where you're not trading posts,
51

52
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:20,760
you work with another account to make an in-between post.
52

53
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:26,250
You see this a lot with personal accounts. Two
influencers, people with large followings, will make
53

54
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:33,380
a photo with both of them in it or they'll do a
conversation with each other and live it or whatever.
54

55
00:03:33,390 --> 00:03:37,250
That's kind of the trailing end of what's available.
55

56
00:03:37,290 --> 00:03:41,510
Now, you could certainly do that, and it's a good
idea, especially if you're very strategic about it,
56

57
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:46,650
but that's not really something that we're going
to cover, because as far as ROI goes, that takes
57

58
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:51,460
a lot of effort, a lot of coordination,
and the return is pretty much, eh,
58

59
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,450
probably the same as doing a traditional shout for shout.
59

60
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,370
So over the next set of lectures,
we're going to do two different things.
60

61
00:03:57,390 --> 00:04:05,520
One, we're going to find a virtual assistant and set up
a process by which they can go and find accounts
61

62
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:10,710
and message them, and then what we're going to do
after that is do something that is truly automated,
62

63
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:15,390
instead of the first one, usually you do one or the other,
and we're going to use Jarvee, which we introduced
63

64
00:04:15,390 --> 00:04:21,930
in a previous section, and use some of their tools to
just automatically grab users and send messages
64

65
00:04:21,930 --> 00:04:24,120
to start this collaboration process.
65

66
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:26,630
Now, there are obvious pros and cons to each one.
66

67
00:04:26,790 --> 00:04:32,580
Pros of hiring someone is it's going to be more
accurate, you're going to have more control over it,
67

68
00:04:33,030 --> 00:04:37,520
but it's going to cost a little bit of money
and it does take some management time.
68

69
00:04:37,530 --> 00:04:43,080
Now, the pros of doing a fully automated version is
that you can do it fully automatic, you don't actually
69

70
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:43,780
have to do anything. You don't
70

71
00:04:43,830 --> 00:04:48,030
have to hire anyone, you don't have to pay any money, besides
a subscription fee to Jarvee, and that's pretty much it,
71

72
00:04:48,030 --> 00:04:48,410
have to hire anyone, you don't have to pay any money, besides
a subscription fee to Jarvee, and that's pretty much it,
72

73
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:52,650
but of course the cons are that, well, it still takes maintenance
time, because you have to go and check it and tweak it,
73

74
00:04:52,650 --> 00:04:53,580
but of course the cons are that, well, it still takes maintenance
time, because you have to go and check it and tweak it,
74

75
00:04:53,730 --> 00:04:58,890
but you also run the risk of, well, because you're using
an automated software, you could potentially do
75

76
00:04:58,890 --> 00:05:02,490
it wrong and have it run rogue,
and get your account in trouble.
76

77
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,270
Now, I don't think it's terribly likely, as long as you're
smart and you follow the advice I give you in this section,
77

78
00:05:06,270 --> 00:05:07,170
Now, I don't think it's terribly likely, as long as you're
smart and you follow the advice I give you in this section,
78

79
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:09,850
but it is definitely a distinct possibility.
79

80
00:05:09,870 --> 00:05:14,280
Now, it is worth mentioning, I think that the maintenance for
running an automated strategy versus a semi-automated
80

81
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:16,350
strategy are almost kind of the same.
81

82
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:22,750
I mean, it's still the tinkering, and twisting,
and the upfront set up costs for both sides.
82

83
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:24,620
So I generally consider that a wash.
83

84
00:05:24,660 --> 00:05:25,290
All right, guys.
84

85
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:32,760
Next lecture, what we'll do is we'll start the process of
setting up a person, an individual who is just cheap or can
85

86
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:38,700
do it on a fixed rate price, to go and find us some 
people, automatically grab their information, and then
86

87
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:40,130
start sending out messages.
87

88
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:40,760
All right. See you then.
