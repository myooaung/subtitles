00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:01,560
All right guys, we're back.
1

2
00:00:01,560 --> 00:00:04,000
Last lecture, we talked about what hashtags are.
2

3
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:09,240
They're just those words that have a pound symbol in front of it and they're used in social media to auto-categorize posts.
3

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:10,880
They're just those words that have a pound symbol in front of it and they're used in social media to auto-categorize posts.
4

5
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:16,920
Some social networks like Facebook don't really use
them, because finding new friends on their platform
5

6
00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:18,780
isn't really a big priority for them.
6

7
00:00:18,780 --> 00:00:24,090
But for Twitter it is a big deal. Twitter invented
the hashtag actually, by the way. Since you
7

8
00:00:24,090 --> 00:00:28,720
guys are from the future, just post in Slack
and tell me if Twitter is profitable yet.
8

9
00:00:28,890 --> 00:00:31,800
I have a feeling future Evan won't be surprised.
9

10
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:32,640
Probably not.
10

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,190
Instagram hashtags are a big deal and one of the few ways Instagram gives us to expand the reach of our posts.
11

12
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:38,930
Instagram hashtags are a big deal and one of the few ways Instagram gives us to expand the reach of our posts.
12

13
00:00:39,060 --> 00:00:42,200
So how do we do it effectively
and without looking like an idiot?
13

14
00:00:42,390 --> 00:00:45,380
Well, there are some quick rules of thumb
that are considered best practice.
14

15
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:47,900
Number one, should you use them to begin with?
15

16
00:00:48,030 --> 00:00:48,710
Yes, dummy.
16

17
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:53,190
We just went over that, they're kind of important. Photos with hashtags get something like 20% more engagement on average.
17

18
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:54,600
We just went over that, they're kind of important. Photos with hashtags get something like 20% more engagement on average.
18

19
00:00:54,600 --> 00:00:57,040
Number two, how many can you use at once?
19

20
00:00:57,060 --> 00:01:02,220
Well, at this moment you can only add
a maximum of 30. Them's the rules.
20

21
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:04,890
Number three is, how many should you use?
21

22
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,120
Ok, now this is a kind of a bizarre question that has been debated and continues to be debated pretty much everywhere.
22

23
00:01:09,120 --> 00:01:10,200
Ok, now this is a kind of a bizarre question that has been debated and continues to be debated pretty much everywhere.
23

24
00:01:10,210 --> 00:01:15,150
It's probably the first question someone new to a Social Media Marketing Facebook group asks and it usually starts
24

25
00:01:15,150 --> 00:01:17,760
a massive flood of comments all contradicting each other.
25

26
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:19,580
Some people say to use them sparingly.
26

27
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:25,090
Some say to use a medium amount, and some
say to just max them out, balls to the wall.
27

28
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:28,470
There are a few big studies that make the argument for each one.
28

29
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:33,240
There was a study by Track Maven, for instance,
that for some reason shows that something
29

30
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:40,100
like 15 hashtags is the perfect combination for
engagement, and that 14 and 16 are sub-optimal.
30

31
00:01:40,230 --> 00:01:41,310
Go figure.
31

32
00:01:41,310 --> 00:01:49,710
Well, I'm going to say no, I don't really buy this,
and just ignore pretty much everything that people
32

33
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:51,900
say about these things in general.
33

34
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:57,810
Now, the reason people say you should use few is
because it might look tacky if you use too many.
34

35
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:03,300
Later we'll talk about where they go and you'll learn
immediately that this is not actually a valid point.
35

36
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:03,940
Later we'll talk about where they go and you'll learn
immediately that this is not actually a valid point.
36

37
00:02:04,110 --> 00:02:09,480
So is there any reason we shouldn't just
max out the post with 30? As far as I can tell,
37

38
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:14,340
I've seen no evidence to suggest that there's an advantage
to not posting the maximum number of these things,
38

39
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:14,990
I've seen no evidence to suggest that there's an advantage
to not posting the maximum number of these things,
39

40
00:02:15,030 --> 00:02:16,170
So that's what we're going to do.
40

41
00:02:16,180 --> 00:02:17,150
30 it is.
41

42
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,380
Now, let's circle back to the point about where they go.
Now, Instagram originally wanted you to post your
42

43
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:23,680
hashtags in the caption,
43

44
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,710
so underneath every photo you'd actually see just a
chunk of hashtags or a weird sentence that's like
44

45
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,640
intermixed with them instead of words.
45

46
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:36,090
Now, that looks pretty much like crap, so naturally what
people started to do was just post them in the comments
46

47
00:02:36,090 --> 00:02:41,970
instead. That way, your caption looks perfectly normal and the hashtag gaudiness is actually pushed down the post visually.
47

48
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:42,810
instead. That way, your caption looks perfectly normal and the hashtag gaudiness is actually pushed down the post visually.
48

49
00:02:42,810 --> 00:02:46,280
People started doing this and, well,
Instagram, like usual, didn't really care.
49

50
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:46,590
Fact: hashtags anywhere in your
post will categorize your posts.
50

51
00:02:46,590 --> 00:02:49,670
Fact: hashtags anywhere in your
post will categorize your posts.
51

52
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,880
You don't actually have to post them in the caption.
52

53
00:02:51,950 --> 00:02:53,090
This is kind of a rookie mistake that a lot of people make.
53

54
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:53,980
This is kind of a rookie mistake that a lot of people make.
54

55
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:56,290
So just post them in the comments,
unless you just want to look bad.
55

56
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:57,670
So just post them in the comments,
unless you just want to look bad.
56

57
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,880
If you want to go even further and you really care
about the aesthetics of your post, then just post
57

58
00:03:01,880 --> 00:03:06,480
the 30 hashtags in the first comment of your post
and then just manually add three more posts.
58

59
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,160
Why?
59

60
00:03:07,380 --> 00:03:12,800
Well, because it will hide the tacky block of hashtags
and make your post look a little more legitimate.
60

61
00:03:12,870 --> 00:03:15,430
Now, what do you post in these first three comments?
61

62
00:03:15,450 --> 00:03:18,360
Well, you have some options, they're all kind of silly.
62

63
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:21,020
You could continue a caption or add another call to action,
63

64
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:23,880
but personally I just think it's just
too much work in general.
64

65
00:03:23,880 --> 00:03:26,360
What I like to do is just post a bunch of dots.
65

66
00:03:26,430 --> 00:03:28,410
So put dot dot dot in each post.
66

67
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,170
So it just looks like it's blank and you wouldn't actually want
to unfold all the comments, or, even weirder, post emojis.
67

68
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,420
So it just looks like it's blank and you wouldn't actually want
to unfold all the comments, or, even weirder, post emojis.
68

69
00:03:35,470 --> 00:03:40,260
Emojis, now remember, add color and personality,
so it's another way of sticking out just a little bit.
69

70
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,360
They're not just made for, like I said, Japanese teenagers.
70

71
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:45,900
You'll see me doing this in the follow
along sections, so don't laugh.
71

72
00:03:45,900 --> 00:03:46,890
You'll see me doing this in the follow
along sections, so don't laugh.
72

73
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,100
So how do you pick the right hashtags?
73

74
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,360
Well, how do you determine what curated
feeds you want your stuff to show up in?
74

75
00:03:53,430 --> 00:03:59,640
Well, I kind of wish there was a specific answer to this,
but since we have virtually no data about these
75

76
00:03:59,640 --> 00:04:04,920
things, we kind of just have to go off with what seems
to work. The best way to do this is to start by just
76

77
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:08,710
thinking of common adjectives of words
that relate to your post and your account.
77

78
00:04:08,730 --> 00:04:11,160
If you post a photo of like, a marathon,
78

79
00:04:11,160 --> 00:04:16,820
there are some obvious ones: #running,
#marathon, #competition, #hardwork, etc.
79

80
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,270
If you post a nice looking boat, the guess what?
80

81
00:04:18,270 --> 00:04:19,100
If you post a nice looking boat, the guess what?
81

82
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:23,070
You're probably going to put #boat, #ocean, #adventure,
82

83
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,720
#iownaboat, something like that.
83

84
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,570
How you expand out from there just comes
down to two things: visualization and research.
84

85
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:29,350
How you expand out from there just comes
down to two things: visualization and research.
85

86
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:34,770
Now, when I say visualization, I mean visualize who you
think it is going to be using this hashtag to find new posts.
86

87
00:04:34,770 --> 00:04:35,820
Now, when I say visualization, I mean visualize who you
think it is going to be using this hashtag to find new posts.
87

88
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:41,030
Remember, there has to be a reason to search for
that hashtag in the first place, so what is the reason?
88

89
00:04:41,190 --> 00:04:43,140
If we were back in our marathon photo,
89

90
00:04:43,140 --> 00:04:48,140
who exactly is searching for #running? People
who are probably obsessed with running.
90

91
00:04:48,150 --> 00:04:49,220
That is pretty easy.
91

92
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:53,650
So the question then becomes, do you want
running enthusiasts to see your profile?
92

93
00:04:53,670 --> 00:04:55,740
Is that the type of crowd you're trying to attract?
93

94
00:04:55,770 --> 00:04:59,180
Well, it depends on what your
account is and what your brand is.
94

95
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,070
You want the most specific crowds you can, because
the people that fit your audience profile are going to
95

96
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:08,690
engage more, which means you'll have higher rates of engagement, which means blah blah blah, Instagram's algorithm
96

97
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:09,960
will actually like you.
97

98
00:05:10,010 --> 00:05:12,040
What about #competition?
98

99
00:05:12,070 --> 00:05:14,570
OK, well, who exactly would be searching for that?
99

100
00:05:14,570 --> 00:05:16,810
Honestly, I'm not entirely sure.
100

101
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:19,960
Maybe someone looking for action
shots of sports or something like that.
101

102
00:05:19,970 --> 00:05:23,910
Now, with every hashtag you use, ask the
question, "Who would be searching for this?"
102

103
00:05:23,930 --> 00:05:28,530
If you're posting a photo of makeup, well, then hashtags like #makeup and #lipstick and #eyeliner kind of make sense.
103

104
00:05:28,550 --> 00:05:29,430
If you're posting a photo of makeup, well, then hashtags like #makeup and #lipstick and #eyeliner kind of make sense.
104

105
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:33,140
What doesn't make sense would be #cute or #beautiful.
105

106
00:05:33,140 --> 00:05:39,230
Now, the person searching for #cute is probably looking
for fluffy animals or floofs, and a person searching
106

107
00:05:39,230 --> 00:05:43,850
for #beautiful is probably either searching
for landscapes or, yes, you guessed it, models.
107

108
00:05:43,850 --> 00:05:48,980
With that being said, if you have a photo of the desert,
don't put #hot, because you know exactly what people
108

109
00:05:48,980 --> 00:05:50,990
are searching for that one for. Now,
109

110
00:05:50,990 --> 00:05:55,900
the more astute of you out there might have asked
out loud, "Why worry about the type of person using
110

111
00:05:55,900 --> 00:05:59,840
a hashtag when you haven't even established
that anyone is searching for that hashtag at all?"
111

112
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,920
For instance, what's the point of analyzing
#bestideaformyaccount
112

113
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:08,660
if no one is searching for it to begin with? And
that's what brings me to the second part of picking
113

114
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:10,730
the best expansion hashtags,
114

115
00:06:10,760 --> 00:06:12,310
that was that one thing called research.
115

116
00:06:12,320 --> 00:06:18,140
You can research it, just go to the Explore tab
and type in the hashtag, you'll see it pop up in the
116

117
00:06:18,140 --> 00:06:19,690
list if it has a following.
117

118
00:06:19,760 --> 00:06:24,160
If it doesn't show up, then no one is searching for it,
and you just wasted your time and maybe your life.
118

119
00:06:24,290 --> 00:06:26,880
OK, so that's the basics of picking the right hashtags.
119

120
00:06:26,900 --> 00:06:29,600
We're going to get more in the mud
with this later in a later section when
120

121
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,490
we cover the tools that you use, how to rotate hashtags,
121

122
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:36,100
what constitutes a saturated hashtag, etc.
122

123
00:06:36,200 --> 00:06:39,900
But for now, this is really all you need to
know to get in and get started posting.
123

124
00:06:39,980 --> 00:06:41,110
Use 30, hide them in the comments,
124

125
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:42,380
Use 30, hide them in the comments,
125

126
00:06:42,380 --> 00:06:47,690
use the obvious ones first and then when you expand,
you just need to be creative but also diligent figuring
