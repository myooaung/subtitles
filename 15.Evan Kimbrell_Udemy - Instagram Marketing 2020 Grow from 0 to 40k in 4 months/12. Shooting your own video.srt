00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:01,830
Hey guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01,840 --> 00:00:08,070
OK this lecture talk about shooting your own video and in a short period of time hopefully I'm going

3
00:00:08,070 --> 00:00:15,310
to try to give you a bit of a head start on things like equipment and settings and strategy.

4
00:00:15,450 --> 00:00:22,260
If you're trying to actually plan out video shoots and then use that for your Instagram channel.

5
00:00:22,260 --> 00:00:26,090
Now a lot of people do that businesses do this a lot with their employees.

6
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:32,070
Take a camera around the office take photos or you know actually make videos and then post that.

7
00:00:32,070 --> 00:00:38,910
There's also things that you can do a lot of people do like go pro shot like videos and then throw those

8
00:00:38,910 --> 00:00:43,090
up again it just kind of pends on what you're doing if you're planning on making your own original content.

9
00:00:43,110 --> 00:00:44,830
Well this is be a lot harder.

10
00:00:44,830 --> 00:00:50,220
I mean you have to do a lot more but I know some of you out there will be interested in doing that.

11
00:00:50,220 --> 00:00:54,180
So if you're promoting yourself like a personal brand or something and you were traveling around the

12
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,310
world will be pretty useful understand how some of this stuff works.

13
00:00:57,320 --> 00:01:01,710
I'm very sorry I can't go into too much depth on this because you know an entirely different course

14
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,640
on how to become a videographer a slash photographer but I'm going to show you what I use and what has

15
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,140
worked for me so far.

16
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:15,130
So first off you can use your phone cameras.

17
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:15,500
All right.

18
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,610
So like this is the iPhone 10.

19
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:19,220
You can use that if you want to.

20
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:21,030
This is the pixel too.

21
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,500
This also has a pretty good camera that the pixel toos camera is better than iPhone 10.

22
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:32,040
It's gotten to a point now where the megapixels and the color contrast and the dynamic range on these

23
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,440
phones are good enough that you could completely use these you could use these on Instagram especially

24
00:01:37,440 --> 00:01:42,940
because it's going to reduce your video size to something really small like you're kind it.

25
00:01:43,210 --> 00:01:48,440
It's kind of hard to get across a really fancy or good looking camera anyway.

26
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,400
And most people have these phones so it's a great place to start if you want to actually upgrade and

27
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:59,880
get into something more like a DSL or my original first camera for shooting courses was called a Canon

28
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:07,580
70 and that one is pretty cheap now and you can buy the body for like $400.

29
00:02:07,650 --> 00:02:13,500
It's very usable It's easy to grab it's kind of bulky but it has a flipout screen that you can kind

30
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,910
of point in either direction.

31
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:19,200
A lot of YouTube's use that if you're George Casey nice that you use as a canon 70.

32
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:19,870
Believe it or not.

33
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:26,850
Downsides it is only shoots in 10 ADP HD it doesn't shoot for OK depending on when you're watching this

34
00:02:26,850 --> 00:02:32,070
course for K could be the new lay of the land or maybe it's this is way in the future and it's like

35
00:02:32,070 --> 00:02:33,450
12 K or something.

36
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:38,340
That is one downside because if you shoot for OK not only are you future proofing your videos but you

37
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:44,040
can reduce them down in size and it'll still look better than if you shot in that reduce size to begin

38
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:44,340
with.

39
00:02:44,340 --> 00:02:47,250
So that's one option I assented graduated from.

40
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:51,860
Now I use what are called Panasonic G.H. 4S.

41
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,510
The reason why I use these is because they're kind of a bit of like a videographer's hack.

42
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:02,640
They're really cheap relatively searching now at the G.H. five is out and good.

43
00:03:02,820 --> 00:03:04,630
You're watching it could be N-Gage eight.

44
00:03:04,770 --> 00:03:06,560
Which means that they're even cheaper now.

45
00:03:06,570 --> 00:03:12,360
But the thing with these is it's the cheapest way you can possibly shoot for AK and for AK video resolution

46
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:19,080
is a great place to try to get to because more resolution just means that you can screw up more things

47
00:03:19,080 --> 00:03:22,020
and still make it look good at the end of the day.

48
00:03:22,050 --> 00:03:23,390
I like it quite a bit.

49
00:03:23,390 --> 00:03:25,790
It's got a flipout screen it's very easy to use.

50
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:28,350
It pairs well with other apps.

51
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:35,140
I actually use a iPad to start and stop and preview all of my videos.

52
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:37,140
So that was pretty useful.

53
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:43,320
It is of course a standalone camera which means you have to mount it on something or you have to carry

54
00:03:43,320 --> 00:03:44,430
it around with yourself.

55
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:51,300
Now you guys watched the lecture about Final Cut Pro we talked a little bit about warp stabilizer and

56
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:57,090
adored the Premier that can solve a lot of it but a lot really comes down to making sure that you're

57
00:03:57,090 --> 00:04:00,150
not bouncing around every time you're filming.

58
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:06,450
Usually shooting freehand like this is a terrible idea try to just get at either a tripod which means

59
00:04:06,450 --> 00:04:13,260
that it's completely standard or you can pre design your shot beforehand or what's called a monopod

60
00:04:13,350 --> 00:04:18,390
which is just one little stick you stick this on top you can't balance by itself but it allows you to

61
00:04:18,390 --> 00:04:22,260
stand behind it and move it around and stabilize it somewhat.

62
00:04:22,260 --> 00:04:30,240
There are also these rigs that you can wear like they're literally like boxes that go in your shoulders

63
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:36,150
and then you can put this in the middle and it keeps it in what's called a gimbal gimbal Basically it's

64
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:44,320
like a three axis a little contraption so that every time you move it can actually stay straight.

65
00:04:44,370 --> 00:04:46,680
So you don't have this going on no matter what.

66
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,500
If you're shooting life style photos and you're in a city or whatever I can be the truth a useful.

67
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:58,080
Personally the way that I shoot those if you notice in some of my promos they'll need these moving shots

68
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:58,910
and cities.

69
00:04:58,950 --> 00:05:02,480
I don't walk around like this because that's just going to look terrible.

70
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:06,240
And also I can't really control the way the White interacts with this.

71
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:13,800
I use what's called an Osmo and they're relatively old now but it's like a stick and that stick has

72
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,720
a little ball on it top.

73
00:05:15,750 --> 00:05:16,840
I don't have it with me.

74
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:18,030
I won't show you otherwise but.

75
00:05:18,050 --> 00:05:20,580
And what it does is it uses film with that.

76
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:25,810
And as I move my arm it always stays static no matter what.

77
00:05:25,920 --> 00:05:29,460
And that's some other cool stuff like you can double click it and turn it on for a selfie and things

78
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:30,800
like that so that's really useful.

79
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,310
I'm just walking around or tracking someone following them.

80
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:36,130
That's incredibly useful.

81
00:05:36,180 --> 00:05:43,020
Also really small things can make a huge difference in your shoots for instance like these.

82
00:05:43,040 --> 00:05:50,160
These costs like $8 and they're called like gorilla pods but yeah you can put these pretty much anywhere

83
00:05:50,910 --> 00:05:56,580
and then attach your phone to it and shoot from any angle that's incredibly useful.

84
00:05:56,580 --> 00:05:58,990
They even have like bigger ones that you use for.

85
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:01,500
Yes a lot of which can be really helpful in a pinch.

86
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,900
Really it's going to come down to what your budget is like.

87
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,080
One thing I'd like to point out is when you're shooting something and say you want to shoot stuff that's

88
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,090
more produced right like this is static.

89
00:06:13,150 --> 00:06:17,400
I come and I talk to you at virtually the same shot every single time.

90
00:06:17,550 --> 00:06:21,930
There's a lot of small things that you can do to focus on and get the best quality.

91
00:06:21,930 --> 00:06:26,340
One thing people don't realize is that lighting is just incredibly important.

92
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:30,570
I personally think it's more important than the camera and more important than the lens that you attach

93
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:31,810
to it.

94
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:37,260
You have the right lighting then any camera or even your iPhone can pick up a great shot.

95
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:42,480
So that's one thing also to pay attention to just look around in your room is the lighting coming down

96
00:06:42,480 --> 00:06:49,050
in a really harsh way on your subject the person you're actually shooting or can you see everything

97
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:50,660
on them are they illuminated.

98
00:06:50,820 --> 00:06:56,520
They're really easy ways to get portable lighting kits I mean they're just a little $30 attachments

99
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:59,420
that go to the top of your camera that shoot ladies.

100
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:04,400
These aren't fantastic but they're great in a pinch especially if you're shooting in like dark spaces.

101
00:07:04,770 --> 00:07:10,650
But if you have the luxury of being able to set up or you shoot then just look into lights I mean there's

102
00:07:10,650 --> 00:07:12,000
three different types of lights.

103
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:20,970
We have fluorescence we have toung stands and we have Ltds fluorescents are what we call daylight so

104
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:27,330
they shine white and they're generally medium range in cost.

105
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:29,220
They don't produce a ton of heat.

106
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:30,360
The other thing is tungsten.

107
00:07:30,390 --> 00:07:35,310
Those are the cheapest but they produce the most heat and those glow warm and they grow in a kind of

108
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:35,950
an orange.

109
00:07:35,970 --> 00:07:38,090
So they're sitting in your living room right now.

110
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:40,190
Look at the light bulb that's above you.

111
00:07:40,230 --> 00:07:45,690
If you just look at it you probably just noticed that that's an orange glow and that light glows in

112
00:07:45,690 --> 00:07:46,380
different ways.

113
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:52,310
Indoors we usually use tungsten for whatever reason it just makes it look more homey because day lights

114
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:55,060
make it look like you're in a hospital.

115
00:07:55,060 --> 00:07:57,120
It's more like visual clarity.

116
00:07:57,210 --> 00:08:02,820
Either way your camera will actually filter that out so it doesn't matter what color you use it's just

117
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:09,780
each one kind of has it's pros and cons the last thing is Ltd's and all can be in either type of color.

118
00:08:09,780 --> 00:08:14,310
The problem is just they're really expensive but they're incredibly portable and useful.

119
00:08:14,310 --> 00:08:20,090
So personally I go for Ltd's just because I don't have a lot of places to store this stuff.

120
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,770
And if you're on a shoe and you're going like going to shoot something you could actually conceivably

121
00:08:25,770 --> 00:08:27,660
bring Ltd's and they can run from batteries.

122
00:08:27,660 --> 00:08:30,640
So that's actually a huge plus.

123
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:37,080
Whereas if you had only daylight's or florescence I mean you'd have to know how you do it.

124
00:08:37,080 --> 00:08:41,340
You have to bring a lot of equipment or have something behind you running with it the entire time.

125
00:08:41,370 --> 00:08:46,080
It's worth pointing out that on Instagram audio is not going to be big no matter what you make you're

126
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,510
probably going the overlaying music on top of it.

127
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:55,680
So it's not really a big part of it like very rarely do people watch videos where it's so important

128
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,340
that you hear the audio or like what they're saying and it needs to be perfectly clear.

129
00:08:59,340 --> 00:09:03,270
So audio is not really something I generally worry about.

130
00:09:03,330 --> 00:09:08,940
There are things like like I have a road Mike and what that is is a mike that just sits on top of your

131
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:12,580
camera wherever you go it points directly at whatever you're trying to film.

132
00:09:12,630 --> 00:09:15,280
That's great for if you're just on the go.

133
00:09:15,630 --> 00:09:17,280
You can use it in other spaces as well.

134
00:09:17,280 --> 00:09:21,310
I think it's fine because just like they're saying and scam audio is just lower.

135
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:23,430
It's not a big priority.

136
00:09:23,460 --> 00:09:29,250
You can do what I use and see it but this is a what's called a shotgun.

137
00:09:29,280 --> 00:09:37,620
Pull it down low and that is basically a stick and you're seeing like movie sets where someone is carrying

138
00:09:37,620 --> 00:09:40,160
a big stick and it's got the microphone at the end of it.

139
00:09:40,170 --> 00:09:41,570
That's a shotgun mike.

140
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:43,550
Yes cut like a boom mike.

141
00:09:43,620 --> 00:09:50,790
That's good if you're in a static place because the quality of the audio is the best they give you the

142
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:57,510
best audio easily and they're the best for like her doing Acco and fragmentation and things like that.

143
00:09:57,510 --> 00:10:04,080
Now another thing I'll say is when you first get say like a lawyer or like a camera like this and you

144
00:10:04,080 --> 00:10:05,190
just start playing around with it.

145
00:10:05,220 --> 00:10:06,270
It's a lot of fun.

146
00:10:06,270 --> 00:10:07,980
I mean they're fun to play with.

147
00:10:08,010 --> 00:10:12,830
One thing I will suggest is that don't obsess yourself over things like white balance.

148
00:10:12,890 --> 00:10:19,200
So what balance is there like how you want your photo to look cool or warm but it also depends on the

149
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:19,750
lighting.

150
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:20,910
We use those tungsten.

151
00:10:20,940 --> 00:10:22,250
I was talking before.

152
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,200
You have to balance it to tungsten light.

153
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:25,830
Otherwise it just looks orange.

154
00:10:25,830 --> 00:10:26,720
Same thing with daylight.

155
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:33,100
You tell your camera all cameras now have auto white balance and that just does it for you.

156
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,900
It's really not worth just worrying about that stuff.

157
00:10:35,970 --> 00:10:37,980
That's something you see on really high productions.

158
00:10:37,980 --> 00:10:44,340
And also it's something that you can fix after the fact in editing and it's pretty easy to do.

159
00:10:44,340 --> 00:10:47,440
So that's something I just I wouldn't really worry about that stuff.

160
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:55,920
Things that you could concern yourself with are things like Aperture and ISO and shutter speed but you

161
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,600
can learn that stuff in 30 minutes.

162
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:03,010
I mean you can put links to that kind of stuff in the resources.

163
00:11:03,060 --> 00:11:06,840
We talked a little bit more about that and one of my other courses of how to get your first thousand

164
00:11:07,560 --> 00:11:10,260
but it's really pretty simple.

165
00:11:10,260 --> 00:11:18,730
Personally I think that the best place to go to learn how to shoot videos is wisteria.

166
00:11:18,780 --> 00:11:24,270
OK if you ever use wisdom there an online video platform they don't compete with YouTube necessarily

167
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:30,170
but they are for people who want to privately embed videos on their Web sites and then get analytics.

168
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,400
They have a platform for that and they're out of like Cambridge Massachusetts.

169
00:11:35,430 --> 00:11:41,490
You go to their Web site they have a great section if you go to learn a dot com and there are videos

170
00:11:41,490 --> 00:11:48,410
and things like shooting your computer screen or how to shoot someone who is working at your company

171
00:11:48,410 --> 00:11:54,080
your quick little things that you can do to set something up on the go and it comes out great.

172
00:11:54,090 --> 00:11:59,880
It also shows you how to do shots that are really really common like the blank background with a gradient

173
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:05,700
kind of growing out of it and it's just a head shot that I actually use in some of my courses so that's

174
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,680
probably the best resource I can then go for really quick and dirty ways of making fun video that applies

175
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:12,470
to Instagram too.

176
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,070
There's tons and tons of stuff out there about shooting video but they're not scaled down to what you

177
00:12:17,070 --> 00:12:20,220
would need on Instagram which is just a much lower requirement.

178
00:12:20,220 --> 00:12:24,360
The other thing I'll say is if you're shooting outdoors look into a thing called a scrim.

179
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:27,210
S C R I M or a reflector.

180
00:12:27,450 --> 00:12:33,240
And if you are shooting outdoors then all you need is a camera some way of getting audio.

181
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:35,040
It doesn't really matter.

182
00:12:35,190 --> 00:12:37,650
And something like a scrimmage or a reflector.

183
00:12:37,650 --> 00:12:38,490
They're really easy.

184
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:42,100
They're just small things you can carry with you and some of them are small unfold.

185
00:12:42,190 --> 00:12:47,040
The Basically what it is is when you're outside the sun is a very capricious thing to work with.

186
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,470
You never know what angle it's going to shine down at or if it's going to be harsh it's like the color

187
00:12:52,470 --> 00:12:55,020
temperature of it changes throughout the day.

188
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:59,070
It can wreck your shots you can have something really really cool and find out that just looks like

189
00:12:59,070 --> 00:12:59,920
crap.

190
00:13:00,140 --> 00:13:05,160
If you use a scrammed what is basically a very thin sheet that you can just hold out in a certain direction

191
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,750
and it diffuses the light.

192
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:10,380
So whatever is underneath it actually looks like something you'd want to see.

193
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,560
And reflectors kind of same thing if the sun's coming down in one side way too strongly not the other.

194
00:13:15,570 --> 00:13:19,680
Put it on the other side and it bounces back and evens out the lighting.

195
00:13:19,740 --> 00:13:21,180
So those are two things you can look at there.

196
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:22,890
I mean you can buy them on Amazon for 20 bucks.

197
00:13:22,890 --> 00:13:28,320
I won't go into any of the more expensive or fancy stuff because it's just not worth it if you're just

198
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:32,130
shooting for a 10 80 by Trinity Square on Instagram.

199
00:13:32,130 --> 00:13:35,070
All right guys hopefully this is somewhat useful.

200
00:13:35,070 --> 00:13:39,170
I mean you could just go down the rabbit hole of this for months and months and months.

201
00:13:39,300 --> 00:13:41,920
But these are the things I found out work pretty well.

202
00:13:41,940 --> 00:13:44,220
The D.H. for are really cheap easy to do.

203
00:13:44,220 --> 00:13:47,240
You can also just get the 70 Ds from Canon.

204
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:48,910
Really really easy stuff.

205
00:13:48,930 --> 00:13:54,630
Get a lens that's adjustable just because you can twist it and zoom in and zoom out.

206
00:13:54,630 --> 00:13:56,820
Don't use what's called a prime lens.

207
00:13:56,850 --> 00:13:58,330
That means you can't zoom in and out.

208
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:01,980
They have a clear picture but they're not as flexible.

209
00:14:01,980 --> 00:14:06,270
You don't really want to be sitting there changing lenses all the time past that.

210
00:14:06,330 --> 00:14:08,660
Just make sure that you're paying attention to lighting.

211
00:14:08,790 --> 00:14:11,700
Audio is really not something to worry about.

212
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:17,040
And then look into things like the Osmo or things like gimbals so that you can carry cameras with you

213
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:18,240
as you go.

214
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,440
And it helps you to stabilize everything because when it stabilize it looks great.

215
00:14:22,520 --> 00:14:24,270
Oh did that check out.

216
00:14:24,450 --> 00:14:27,770
I think they're probably the best for getting started on this.

217
00:14:28,130 --> 00:14:32,620
Any other questions about how I do anything or how I would do something.

218
00:14:32,700 --> 00:14:34,920
Feel free to post in the slack and we'll talk to you there.

219
00:14:34,950 --> 00:14:36,130
Otherwise see you next Dr..
