00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:01,960
All right guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:02,170 --> 00:00:08,850
OK, now that we've hopefully gotten the username of
our dreams, we need to do the next thing in line, which
2

3
00:00:08,850 --> 00:00:11,360
is to set our account name.
3

4
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:18,420
Yes, I know they sound exactly the same, because they're
kind of the same thing, but they also kind of aren't.
4

5
00:00:18,610 --> 00:00:25,110
It's just for some reason this idiosyncrasy of Instagram
that your user name isn't your actual name.
5

6
00:00:25,110 --> 00:00:29,700
Now, remember this was originally created for people to
share photos, specifically ones that were self-conscious
6

7
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:34,670
about the quality of their photos, and hence
that's why they had filters to begin with.
7

8
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:39,080
So each account was only supposed to be a person.
8

9
00:00:39,150 --> 00:00:39,810
Well, that's great.
9

10
00:00:39,810 --> 00:00:43,250
So why not just make the username the name?
10

11
00:00:43,270 --> 00:00:49,620
Well, because the username has to work on a URL,
so that people can access your page, and well, you
11

12
00:00:49,620 --> 00:00:52,740
know, URLs, you can't have a space in them, for instance.
12

13
00:00:52,830 --> 00:00:53,250
Now, seriously,
13

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:59,850
try to go to Facebook.com / your name with an actual space in it.
14

15
00:00:59,850 --> 00:01:00,830
It just explodes.
15

16
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:03,610
Also, the username has to stay lowercase.
16

17
00:01:03,620 --> 00:01:09,750
Why? Again, because some neck beard 30 years ago
thought it would make sense that capitalizing letters
17

18
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:14,570
in a URL would take you to different content
on a server versus the lowercase version.
18

19
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,650
Again, try that one. Try to go to your name on Facebook
and try to capitalize one letter, it doesn't work.
19

20
00:01:19,650 --> 00:01:20,030
Again, try that one. Try to go to your name on Facebook
and try to capitalize one letter, it doesn't work.
20

21
00:01:20,100 --> 00:01:23,100
That's also why special characters
don't work in your username.
21

22
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,560
So if you wanted your username to be an actual name,
it would need spaces and capitalization.
22

23
00:01:27,690 --> 00:01:33,990
Can't do that with URLs, so we have this ungodly mix of
name and username, not the same but not completely different.
23

24
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:35,070
Can't do that with URLs, so we have this ungodly mix of
name and username, not the same but not completely different.
24

25
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:35,860
What's that?
25

26
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,210
You never really wanted to know why
there were separate parts of the profile?
26

27
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:42,280
Well, excuse me for imparting you with a useless factoid.
27

28
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:43,660
Anyway, they're different.
28

29
00:01:43,740 --> 00:01:48,750
Your name shows up in two different places, here at
the top of your bio in bold, and here in the search
29

30
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:54,180
results. And that leads me to the key takeaway of
picking a name. When you search on Instagram,
30

31
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:57,690
it only uses two fields, username and name.
31

32
00:01:57,690 --> 00:02:03,990
Yes, it is surprisingly unsophisticated in that way,
especially when it has so much more information to
32

33
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,540
use, like your bio, to make a decision on relevancy.
33

34
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:12,540
Also, there's plenty of algorithms out there now that
can figure out what's in a photograph, so that would
34

35
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:15,790
make sense, they could parse that up
and use it in their search, but they don't.
35

36
00:02:16,060 --> 00:02:18,570
Anyway, this at least clears things up for us.
36

37
00:02:18,570 --> 00:02:23,730
We know exactly what matters - name and username
for search, because search is pretty important.
37

38
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:29,610
So when choosing a name, we're going to always
be thinking of keywords. What keywords do we
38

39
00:02:29,610 --> 00:02:35,750
want to rank for, and being honest, are our theoretical
fans or customers going to be searching for us?
39

40
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:42,510
If you make WordPress plugin tools, are people going
to be searching for WordPress on Instagram?
40

41
00:02:42,510 --> 00:02:45,480
Wouldn't that be something you'd
more likely search for on Google?
41

42
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:50,820
So what I like to say is pick 2-3 keywords that you think
people might be searching for and that relate to you.
42

43
00:02:50,820 --> 00:02:52,020
So what I like to say is pick 2-3 keywords that you think
people might be searching for and that relate to you.
43

44
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,060
If you don't know what relates to you,
44

45
00:02:54,060 --> 00:03:02,340
my favorite thing to do is go to ranksonic.com/generate-keywords.html, I'll put it up on the screen.
45

46
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:03,210
my favorite thing to do is go to ranksonic.com/generate-keywords.html, I'll put it up on the screen.
46

47
00:03:03,210 --> 00:03:04,020
OK.
47

48
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,120
It's also in the resources. What you can do is
just plug in the URL of your website, and it'll just
48

49
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,600
look at what you have going on and give you a
list of keywords it would assume your niche is
49

50
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:19,200
interested in. When I plug in evankimbrell.com,
I get things like start a business, online classes,
50

51
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,670
business ideas, I also get like web development, which is
a little bit weird. So I might scratch some of those down,
51

52
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:24,500
business ideas, I also get like web development, which is
a little bit weird. So I might scratch some of those down,
52

53
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:31,020
although of those three, I would imagine really only
someone searching for, like, probably business ideas,
53

54
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:33,070
although I could be wrong.
54

55
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:35,160
That's my general take on Instagram right now.
55

56
00:03:35,160 --> 00:03:39,150
I don't know why they'd be searching for the other stuff.
It only takes a couple seconds to proof this out.
56

57
00:03:39,150 --> 00:03:42,690
I mean, just go to Instagram, go to search,
and just type it in, and see what happens.
57

58
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,060
Once you do have a couple keywords though, just
set those aside, and then follow along as I ask you
58

59
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,830
a couple of basic questions.
59

60
00:03:49,830 --> 00:03:55,170
How would you summarize what the account is? If you're
a business, what's a clever one short sentence, it's about
60

61
00:03:55,170 --> 00:04:01,320
30 characters, so maybe four or five short words that
summarize you? In the business case, it's usually pretty easy.
61

62
00:04:01,320 --> 00:04:02,570
30 characters, so maybe four or five short words that
summarize you? In the business case, it's usually pretty easy.
62

63
00:04:02,580 --> 00:04:05,360
Use the headline on your home page for instance.
63

64
00:04:05,570 --> 00:04:10,860
You could use your brand motto or slogan, or you can
even use the subtitle you chose for your website, and
64

65
00:04:10,870 --> 00:04:12,570
I mean, subtitle meaning,
65

66
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:17,910
like when you search for your name in Google, what actually shows up as the first sentence underneath the link you click.
66

67
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:19,110
like when you search for your name in Google, what actually shows up as the first sentence underneath the link you click.
67

68
00:04:19,110 --> 00:04:22,110
Hopefully you set that, because
that's actually pretty important.
68

69
00:04:22,110 --> 00:04:25,490
It's part of the meta data, if you don't have
that, Google doesn't like you. Anyway,
69

70
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:30,570
one of those will always work, and it's generally the same
case if you're creating account for a person or personality.
70

71
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:31,280
one of those will always work, and it's generally the same
case if you're creating account for a person or personality.
71

72
00:04:31,290 --> 00:04:36,390
If you haven't yet built a business around yourself,
then you might have to get a little bit more creative.
72

73
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:40,280
So what exactly do you want people
to think about you and your profile?
73

74
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:42,390
What do you do on this page?
74

75
00:04:42,390 --> 00:04:45,120
Answer that question as succinctly as you can.
75

76
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,700
Remember, we can always go back and change this later.
76

77
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:51,260
And if you honestly can't think of anything at all,
77

78
00:04:51,270 --> 00:04:55,010
it's perfectly fine to just put your name or your brand name.
78

79
00:04:55,020 --> 00:04:56,740
Actually, it's pretty easy.
79

80
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:01,550
You don't stick out because probably
80% of the accounts you see do this,
80

81
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:03,600
so it just doesn't look that weird.
81

82
00:05:03,620 --> 00:05:08,540
It's really just that it's more of a
wasted opportunity than anything else.
82

83
00:05:08,540 --> 00:05:12,000
So I think of it kind of like blogs and headlines. To go to a blog,
83

84
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:17,930
you go to a URL, and then you get blasted with a
giant headline that essentially summarizes the post
84

85
00:05:18,290 --> 00:05:24,270
and it entices you to read on. When you share the blog
post, you usually only see those two things as well,
85

86
00:05:24,290 --> 00:05:24,840
the URL and the headline.
86

87
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:25,710
the URL and the headline.
87

88
00:05:25,730 --> 00:05:32,570
So it's kind of like that. If you wrote a blog post about
your account, what would the headline say? The
88

89
00:05:32,570 --> 00:05:38,630
next step is basically to see if you can get one of
your keywords in that headline. If you can, great.
89

90
00:05:38,690 --> 00:05:40,820
If you can't, it's fine, you can always try later.
90

91
00:05:40,820 --> 00:05:41,870
So that's really it.
91

92
00:05:41,870 --> 00:05:47,630
I mean, what's the one-two punch that will get people to click
your account and get what you're there for, and do that quickly?
92

93
00:05:47,660 --> 00:05:49,910
I mean, what's the one-two punch that will get people to click
your account and get what you're there for, and do that quickly?
93

94
00:05:49,910 --> 00:05:52,240
Mystery in this case really doesn't work.
94

95
00:05:52,280 --> 00:05:57,590
If I can give you one piece of advice here, it's don't use
the same thing for both your username and your name.
95

96
00:05:57,590 --> 00:05:58,630
If I can give you one piece of advice here, it's don't use
the same thing for both your username and your name.
96

97
00:05:58,640 --> 00:06:02,720
Not only do you look amateurish,
but you're wasting that space for search.
97

98
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,700
If you're trying to rank for entrepreneur and you
just put "entrepreneur" four times as your account
98

99
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:11,250
name, Instagram doesn't count that
four times, it doesn't make a difference.
99

100
00:06:11,250 --> 00:06:14,000
Now, let's look at some accounts
that are actually doing this well.
100

101
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:17,830
Again, we'll look at that company called Foundr Australia,
101

102
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,610
they do pretty well on Instagram. Foundr is
their username, that's the company name,
102

103
00:06:20,620 --> 00:06:21,860
they do pretty well on Instagram. Foundr is
their username, that's the company name,
103

104
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,700
but then for their actual account name,
they put Young Entrepreneur Magazine.
104

105
00:06:25,790 --> 00:06:26,250
Yes. OK.
105

106
00:06:26,330 --> 00:06:26,590
Yes. OK.
106

107
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:31,580
Now, if you saw Foundr and you didn't know what
it was, that title in bold and in the search would tell
107

108
00:06:31,580 --> 00:06:34,770
you instantly what it was, even before you clicked on it.
108

109
00:06:34,910 --> 00:06:37,460
Double points because they got entrepreneur in
there, since that's a big thing they're going for.
109

110
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:39,290
Double points because they got entrepreneur in
there, since that's a big thing they're going for.
110

111
00:06:39,290 --> 00:06:42,540
OK, now here's an individual, let's look at Dan Martell.
111

112
00:06:42,540 --> 00:06:48,920
If you don't know him, he started a website called Clarity
FM, it's actually a tool I referenced in my other courses.
112

113
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:54,380
He put Growth Minded Entrepreneur great. It's a three
word summary of essentially who he is, or who he
113

114
00:06:54,380 --> 00:06:57,240
wants to be, he specializes in growth and entrepreneurship,
114

115
00:06:57,290 --> 00:07:00,380
so that works pretty well, and he
did a good job of doing that.
115

116
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:03,810
Now, here's another one on a totally
different vertical, 1minutemakeup.
116

117
00:07:03,850 --> 00:07:04,240
OK.
117

118
00:07:04,280 --> 00:07:11,510
If you read just that username, you wouldn't know what we're talking about, but the name in bold explains it instantly.
118

119
00:07:11,510 --> 00:07:12,500
If you read just that username, you wouldn't know what we're talking about, but the name in bold explains it instantly.
119

120
00:07:12,530 --> 00:07:16,980
It says, oh, what's 1minutemakeup? It's makeup tutorials.
120

121
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:18,680
Now, why am i looking at this page?
121

122
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:19,720
Makeup tutorials. Great.
122

123
00:07:19,730 --> 00:07:20,110
Makeup tutorials. Great.
123

124
00:07:20,110 --> 00:07:21,460
So hopefully this makes sense to you.
