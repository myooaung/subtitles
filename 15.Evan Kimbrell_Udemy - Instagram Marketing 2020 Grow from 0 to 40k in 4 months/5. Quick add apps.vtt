00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:01.700
Hey guys, welcome back.
1

2
00:00:01.730 --> 00:00:02.000
OK.
2

3
00:00:02.030 --> 00:00:04.540
So I've got a little bit of an extra lecture.
3

4
00:00:04.580 --> 00:00:09.450
What we're going to do in this one is I'm going to show you
some of the quick add apps, at least that's what I call them.
4

5
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:10.780
What we're going to do in this one is I'm going to show you
some of the quick add apps, at least that's what I call them.
5

6
00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:16.790
So you can make photos on your phone, and since
Instagram's all on your phone or is primarily on your
6

7
00:00:16.790 --> 00:00:22.430
phone, it kind of makes sense there would be a whole
cottage industry of apps that are there to help you
7

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:26.330
make these quickly and on the go. Depending
on what kind of account you're making,
8

9
00:00:26.330 --> 00:00:30.350
these can have limited usefulness for you.
If you're doing a themed account, they're great.
9

10
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:31.120
these can have limited usefulness for you.
If you're doing a themed account, they're great.
10

11
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:39.500
If you're doing a business, and you, let's say, want to
throw up text on a photo you took, then that's pretty useful.
11

12
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:40.290
If you're doing a business, and you, let's say, want to
throw up text on a photo you took, then that's pretty useful.
12

13
00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.510
If you're a business that's okay doing quotes or, I don't know, it's useful for a lot of different
13

14
00:00:47.510 --> 00:00:53.060
things. If you do those "ask the audience" posts, then you can
use them for that, but really it's more for static images plus text
14

15
00:00:53.150 --> 00:00:55.420
things. If you do those "ask the audience" posts, then you can
use them for that, but really it's more for static images plus text
15

16
00:00:55.550 --> 00:00:58.800
and then there's some functionality for
adding logos and things like watermarks.
16

17
00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.310
So, depending on what you're doing, pretty helpful.
17

18
00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.270
So, depending on what you're doing, pretty helpful.
18

19
00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.320
I think it's worth checking them out.
19

20
00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.380
Although I personally am not really going to use them.
20

21
00:01:05.390 --> 00:01:11.630
I'll use them for inspiration on
effects, and styles, and text like that.
21

22
00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:16.850
But for the most part, I'm going to stay out
of the quick add apps. Totally up to you.
22

23
00:01:16.850 --> 00:01:20.840
So we'll start with iOS and then we'll do Android.
23

24
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:25.550
Now, the two things I'm using, one's called Typorama
and the other one is called Wordswag.
24

25
00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:31.760
Both kind of do the same thing, Typorama works
a lot better on iOS, and Wordswag works well
25

26
00:01:31.790 --> 00:01:36.550
on I'd say both of them, they're pretty much the
exact same, but it works pretty well on Android,
26

27
00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:39.430
so that's why we're going to cover Wordswag as well. Functionality wise, they're kind of the same thing, they have some quirks.
27

28
00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.490
so that's why we're going to cover Wordswag as well. Functionality wise, they're kind of the same thing, they have some quirks.
28

29
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:42.740
All right.
29

30
00:01:42.770 --> 00:01:46.130
So I've just got to find Typorama.
30

31
00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.670
There it is.
31

32
00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:53.740
Typorama is a free app, but it also has a paid version,
like a pro version, and the pro version I believe
32

33
00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.760
just gives you more templates and more styles to use,
so use the free version and then see if you like it.
33

34
00:01:58.760 --> 00:01:58.910
just gives you more templates and more styles to use,
so use the free version and then see if you like it.
34

35
00:01:58.910 --> 00:02:05.060
So the way that this basically works is they give you
tons and tons of stock images, and they also connect
35

36
00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:10.850
to some online databases of stock images,
I think they use Pexels or Pixabay.
36

37
00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:14.200
So that means they have millions
of stock photos that you can use.
37

38
00:02:14.250 --> 00:02:16.900
You can search for really whatever you want.
38

39
00:02:16.910 --> 00:02:20.930
They've kind of curated some of
the best looking ones right here.
39

40
00:02:20.930 --> 00:02:28.060
But if I wanted something like a rocket, let's search for a rocket, see, there you go. So it goes through Pixabay, and there you go.
40

41
00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:28.410
But if I wanted something like a rocket, let's search for a rocket, see, there you go. So it goes through Pixabay, and there you go.
41

42
00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:28.870
But if I wanted something like a rocket, let's search for a rocket, see, there you go. So it goes through Pixabay, and there you go.
42

43
00:02:28.990 --> 00:02:35.740
So they're not as clean and sharp as the other ones, but
you can kind of see that they're still pretty dang good.
43

44
00:02:35.770 --> 00:02:36.640
So they're not as clean and sharp as the other ones, but
you can kind of see that they're still pretty dang good.
44

45
00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:38.480
That's a really nice photo.
45

46
00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:39.640
OK.
46

47
00:02:39.670 --> 00:02:46.390
So other than that it's, you know, you can use
your own photos, which is perfectly fine.
47

48
00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:50.360
You can do presets, and this is for sizes, so Typorama,
48

49
00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:55.640
you can use for any social media account, but they have
Instagram post and Instagram story, that's obviously 
49

50
00:02:55.690 --> 00:02:56.620
what we care about.
50

51
00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:58.300
You can use them for your stories, that's helpful.
51

52
00:02:58.300 --> 00:02:58.850
You can use them for your stories, that's helpful.
52

53
00:02:58.850 --> 00:03:04.720
Keep in mind, stories are just more column shaped,
they're taller. Instagram posts are just squares.
53

54
00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:06.310
And then over here we have colors.
54

55
00:03:06.310 --> 00:03:12.550
So if you wanted to just put a flat color
background, that's one way of doing it.
55

56
00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:13.990
Totally up to you.
56

57
00:03:14.020 --> 00:03:17.260
We looked at one account earlier called Foundr minus the E,
57

58
00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:20.140
that's what they do, they just do solid color background.
58

59
00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:23.640
So if you're just focusing on text,
then that's one way of doing it.
59

60
00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.640
And, you know, also sometimes you do
themed posts, like, say it's Valentine's Day.
60

61
00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:32.560
Well, here's a lot of pink and maroon-ish
red that you could use as well.
61

62
00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:40.750
So let's say we pick a stock image, and I'm going
to look for something that's like a lab, it's going
62

63
00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:42.080
to give me probably a lot of dogs.
63

64
00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:42.290
Okay.
64

65
00:03:42.310 --> 00:03:47.290
So I'm going to try to create something
that might fit for Innovation Station.
65

66
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.800
And so, like, labs, and beakers, and innovation,
and science, I think those kind of go together.
66

67
00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:55.790
No, I don't want a black lab, although they're adorable.
67

68
00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.550
I'll probably pick something like this.
68

69
00:03:57.560 --> 00:03:57.840
OK.
69

70
00:03:57.870 --> 00:03:59.590
So that's pretty good.
70

71
00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:01.110
How do you want to use your creation?
71

72
00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:02.600
I want it to be an Instagram post.
72

73
00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.840
So you click that, and then you can
crop it by pinching if you want to.
73

74
00:04:05.890 --> 00:04:08.670
But for the most part, I think this is pretty good.
74

75
00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.430
So hit next.
75

76
00:04:12.500 --> 00:04:12.850
All right.
76

77
00:04:12.870 --> 00:04:19.220
So what it does is it starts you off with some
text and they have all sorts of pre-stylized text.
77

78
00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:24.710
So, I mean, many of these work. These are nice because
sometimes you don't know what font you want to use,
78

79
00:04:24.830 --> 00:04:31.280
so what you can do is just borrow one of these and
then delete all the extra stuff, and then just keep
79

80
00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:33.470
their font, at least that's what I do sometimes.
80

81
00:04:33.470 --> 00:04:40.720
But you can kind of go through these and then just see what fits
well with the image that you have, like, that's pretty cool.
81

82
00:04:40.730 --> 00:04:41.720
But you can kind of go through these and then just see what fits
well with the image that you have, like, that's pretty cool.
82

83
00:04:41.720 --> 00:04:47.440
I'm looking for contrast with the background, personally.
83

84
00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:53.540
So you can kind of keep going through it. Again,
we'll do some contrast stuff later. As you can see, it
84

85
00:04:53.540 --> 00:05:00.020
already added my logo because I have that added,
it's actually over here in the watermark section, but
85

86
00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.800
we'll get to that in a second.
86

87
00:05:02.930 --> 00:05:06.870
So what I need to do is pick a frame for text.
87

88
00:05:06.970 --> 00:05:08.180
What do I want to do?
88

89
00:05:08.180 --> 00:05:14.090
I'm focused more on something that kind of fits
the general feeling of what we're looking at.
89

90
00:05:14.090 --> 00:05:19.970
I think that's actually kind of cool, it goes with the rocket,
and I think I can contrast out the background enough.
90

91
00:05:19.970 --> 00:05:20.500
I think that's actually kind of cool, it goes with the rocket,
and I think I can contrast out the background enough.
91

92
00:05:20.630 --> 00:05:26.930
Now, if you want to screw with the text, you can
do this, and you can change the orientation and
92

93
00:05:26.930 --> 00:05:33.920
size, and so on. The way that you edit it is you just double
tap the text like that and then you have to edit it right here.
93

94
00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:35.090
size, and so on. The way that you edit it is you just double
tap the text like that and then you have to edit it right here.
94

95
00:05:35.090 --> 00:05:39.360
Now, down here, they have two options, "get a random quote,"
and then "manual line breaks." Manual line breaks
95

96
00:05:39.380 --> 00:05:42.040
means that it won't automatically do the line break for you,
96

97
00:05:42.050 --> 00:05:46.420
so it doesn't automatically pick where in
the sentence to move on to the next line.
97

98
00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:52.070
Usually, you only do that if it's breaking in a way that you
just really don't like, and then "get a random quote,"
98

99
00:05:52.070 --> 00:05:52.900
Usually, you only do that if it's breaking in a way that you
just really don't like, and then "get a random quote,"
99

100
00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.310
that's actually pretty useful, I'll be honest, that really
just gives you a quote, you know, and even if it has
100

101
00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:00.150
nothing to do with what you're talking about,
101

102
00:06:00.170 --> 00:06:01.900
it's a great way to play around with it.
102

103
00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:02.690
I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.
103

104
00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:04.770
I have not failed. I've just found 10,000 ways that won't work.
104

105
00:06:04.850 --> 00:06:10.480
Cool. My life in a nutshell. And then
what we can do is over here,
105

106
00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:12.560
so we're in the text tab,
106

107
00:06:12.590 --> 00:06:17.970
and then we move over to, let's say,
the color tab, right after we resize this.
107

108
00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:23.210
Ok, kind of looks like a graphic
novel type design or something.
108

109
00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.910
So we'll go to color. Now, color is
going to change the color of the text.
109

110
00:06:24.910 --> 00:06:27.930
So we'll go to color. Now, color is
going to change the color of the text.
110

111
00:06:27.940 --> 00:06:32.800
Personally, I don't really think there's any way
to improve on it, so I'm going to stick with this.
111

112
00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:37.570
You can choose a custom color right there, but unfortunately,
it's like, you have to use your finger, so if you
112

113
00:06:37.570 --> 00:06:41.560
need to get a color that's identical
to your brand, good luck with that.
113

114
00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:42.380
need to get a color that's identical
to your brand, good luck with that.
114

115
00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:46.330
And then this is opacity, so if you
want it to not show up as much,
115

116
00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:52.030
which is helpful if you want to add in something
like quotations, like you saw we did with Canva.
116

117
00:06:52.390 --> 00:06:57.790
So if I wanted to add extra text I'd just hit this plus
button up here, and now I have more text. And then
117

118
00:06:57.790 --> 00:07:00.370
maybe I could mess with the opacity of this,
118

119
00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.860
so that fits behind the text that I have.
119

120
00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.130
Okay.
120

121
00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.930
So then, moving on, we can do shadow, and
then shadow is kind of the same thing. Again,
121

122
00:07:07.930 --> 00:07:12.250
I personally like to just stick with the templated
text they give you, but you have a lot of options.
122

123
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:15.060
So you can blur it if you want.
123

124
00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:16.180
It doesn't really do much.
124

125
00:07:16.210 --> 00:07:19.250
I think that just doesn't really work for every single...
125

126
00:07:19.270 --> 00:07:19.460
Okay.
126

127
00:07:19.480 --> 00:07:20.370
So there you go.
127

128
00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:23.980
Now you can see that this really
has a shadow on the back.
128

129
00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.520
It's going to depend on how much you like the different look.
129

130
00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:33.810
So yeah, it really sticks out when you do it that way.
130

131
00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.210
So I like the contrast.
131

132
00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.730
I'm going to give it some. OK.
132

133
00:07:37.750 --> 00:07:40.640
Then you can also change the color of the background.
133

134
00:07:40.660 --> 00:07:47.070
Usually it's by default black, but you
can make it white, red, whatever.
134

135
00:07:47.270 --> 00:07:52.300
See, I think I'll come back to this one
later to see if I need color to break it up.
135

136
00:07:52.300 --> 00:07:55.300
My main concern is when you scroll past it,
136

137
00:07:55.300 --> 00:08:00.100
how easy is it to read and how quickly
does it draw your eyes to the actual text.
137

138
00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:03.390
So then we go to gradient, and you can do a gradient,
138

139
00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:04.550
that's another option.
139

140
00:08:05.410 --> 00:08:07.630
For me, that stuff's a little 2006.
140

141
00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:12.130
Some designers can still do gradients really well,
and I'm not a designer, so I don't generally touch
141

142
00:08:12.130 --> 00:08:17.110
gradients, but the way that this generally works is,
a gradient is when you start with one color and end
142

143
00:08:17.110 --> 00:08:20.790
in one color, and so in the middle it transitions slowly.
143

144
00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:23.630
Our logo actually has that in the colored version.
144

145
00:08:23.770 --> 00:08:26.540
So what you do is you pick a starting color.
145

146
00:08:26.610 --> 00:08:29.170
Let's say it's a green, and then the
end color, say it's like a darker green.
146

147
00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:32.460
Let's say it's a green, and then the
end color, say it's like a darker green.
147

148
00:08:33.100 --> 00:08:37.960
Yeah, it's kind of like phosphorescent or something,
and then you can change the direction.
148

149
00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:43.360
So notice how it usually starts from the center
and then points outwards, so there we go.
149

150
00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.890
Like it's, you can just kind of screw with
it till you find something that you like.
150

151
00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:47.760
If you don't like it, just hit disable. Ok, moving on. Eraser.
151

152
00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:50.260
If you don't like it, just hit disable. Ok, moving on. Eraser.
152

153
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:55.090
Now, this is helpful if, like I was saying before, you
just want to use the text. If you just wanna use the
153

154
00:08:55.090 --> 00:09:02.320
text and not, say, like, the extra lines or the little
graphical winging things that they put in there, you
154

155
00:09:02.320 --> 00:09:06.000
can use that. The way you just do this is you
155

156
00:09:06.010 --> 00:09:11.590
play around with the eraser size and then the intensity,
but then you basically throw your finger on here
156

157
00:09:11.860 --> 00:09:14.630
and see where the green circle is,
157

158
00:09:14.650 --> 00:09:21.760
I'm just destroying everything that's touching that, and
this is honestly not the easiest thing to use, I'll be honest.
158

159
00:09:21.770 --> 00:09:23.240
I'm just destroying everything that's touching that, and
this is honestly not the easiest thing to use, I'll be honest.
159

160
00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.180
But if you really need to clean something, it's going
to take several tries, but you'll get it eventually.
160

161
00:09:27.190 --> 00:09:30.420
I think the thing with this is that
it's on your mobile phone,
161

162
00:09:30.430 --> 00:09:32.530
so I don't really know what you expect.
162

163
00:09:32.620 --> 00:09:34.420
So undo, if you want to do that,
you can always move backwards.
163

164
00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.190
So undo, if you want to do that,
you can always move backwards.
164

165
00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:39.120
Then there's the 3D rotation.
165

166
00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:44.570
You know, this one's not a hugely important one.
166

167
00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:46.380
Sometimes it doesn't even work, to be honest.
167

168
00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:49.380
It's essentially going to twist it like that or like this.
168

169
00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:50.530
You may not even notice it on some.
169

170
00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:51.640
So I usually skip it.
170

171
00:09:52.190 --> 00:09:52.410
OK.
171

172
00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:53.370
Moving on to the next section,
we have Background. Now, here,
172

173
00:09:53.380 --> 00:09:56.410
Moving on to the next section,
we have Background. Now, here,
173

174
00:09:56.530 --> 00:10:00.140
what we did before is we searched stock images,
and that's generally what you see first,
174

175
00:10:00.140 --> 00:10:04.600
then we have the choose color, choose my photos. Now,
I'm just going to move on to overlays. Overlays are kind
175

176
00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:08.020
of cool, because what you can do is
you can throw on a pattern on top of this.
176

177
00:10:08.050 --> 00:10:10.570
So if you wanted it like that.
177

178
00:10:10.570 --> 00:10:15.140
That's like the... I can't remember what
that's called, it's like similar to Moray.
178

179
00:10:15.160 --> 00:10:19.880
You see it in a lot of urban city shots at night.
179

180
00:10:20.330 --> 00:10:24.210
You can kind of play around with these, generally
I suggest toning down the intensity.
180

181
00:10:24.220 --> 00:10:26.460
They're nice when they're subtle, but when
they're like that, oh my God, not so much.
181

182
00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:27.870
They're nice when they're subtle, but when
they're like that, oh my God, not so much.
182

183
00:10:27.910 --> 00:10:28.780
They're nice when they're subtle, but when
they're like that, oh my God, not so much.
183

184
00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:30.410
There's other effects here, like dust.
184

185
00:10:30.430 --> 00:10:32.380
So it makes it look like an old photograph.
185

186
00:10:32.380 --> 00:10:33.000
I don't know.
186

187
00:10:33.010 --> 00:10:39.340
To me, it kind of looks like a horror flick, but up
to you. Really it just takes some tweaking.
187

188
00:10:39.340 --> 00:10:40.960
And if that fits your brand, then go for it.
188

189
00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:44.590
There's a couple ones in here that I thought
were kind of interesting, like the smoke.
189

190
00:10:44.590 --> 00:10:45.190
Sure.
190

191
00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:48.010
I mean, not great for kids, but great for Instagram.
191

192
00:10:48.010 --> 00:10:52.940
So you can make like a real subtle smoke, or not.
192

193
00:10:53.470 --> 00:10:54.670
Let's see if I can get better smoke.
193

194
00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:56.370
Yeah, sure.
194

195
00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:01.930
It's like something exploded or something, I don't know,
I could probably play that into a rocket or some
195

196
00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:08.080
kind of theme like that. Ok, now over here we have
filters. Filters are just presets that you can use,
196

197
00:11:08.260 --> 00:11:13.510
like, if I just wanted, if I just knew I had a preset
that I liked, I could just use that. Very similar
197

198
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.890
to Instagram, whether you like these
better than Instagram, I don't know.
198

199
00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.100
to Instagram, whether you like these
better than Instagram, I don't know.
199

200
00:11:18.130 --> 00:11:19.970
Doesn't really matter for me, I don't usually use filters.
200

201
00:11:20.040 --> 00:11:26.100
So then adjustments, again, the way I usually get the text
to stick out from the background is I lower contrast.
201

202
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:26.900
So then adjustments, again, the way I usually get the text
to stick out from the background is I lower contrast.
202

203
00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.180
You can also blur it.
203

204
00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.590
You can also lower the brightness, there's
a lot of different ways you can do it.
204

205
00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:33.350
But personally, this is how I do it.
205

206
00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:40.690
So, like, that's too much, so we'll just lower the contrast,
and then same other settings that we kind of
206

207
00:11:40.690 --> 00:11:43.920
covered when we went over the user
interface for posting on Instagram.
207

208
00:11:44.050 --> 00:11:46.240
You can vignette, you can blur, again,
208

209
00:11:46.600 --> 00:11:48.120
be careful when you blur.
209

210
00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.890
It's just, at a certain point, you can't even  tell what it is.
210

211
00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:56.770
So if you want people to focus on the foreground,
but also know what it is in the background, then keep
211

212
00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:57.950
the blur to a minimum.
212

213
00:11:57.960 --> 00:12:02.980
So we do that, I think that's perfectly fine.
213

214
00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:06.440
That smoke's probably a little overdone, but whatever.
214

215
00:12:06.670 --> 00:12:06.920
OK.
215

216
00:12:06.940 --> 00:12:09.400
Now, moving on to watermark. The last thing is the watermark,
216

217
00:12:09.400 --> 00:12:12.090
and essentially what that is is your logo.
217

218
00:12:12.310 --> 00:12:14.920
They call it a watermark, but it's not a watermark.
218

219
00:12:15.070 --> 00:12:18.760
There's two different things, you can put in your logo and your
logo is just going to be something that's white or an outline,
219

220
00:12:18.790 --> 00:12:19.630
There's two different things, you can put in your logo and your
logo is just going to be something that's white or an outline,
220

221
00:12:19.630 --> 00:12:23.920
and it shows that it's yours and it's good for branding,
a watermark on the other hand is something that's
221

222
00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.750
semi-transparent that you can read when you look
at it, but it doesn't really stick out. What that's used
222

223
00:12:28.750 --> 00:12:30.610
for is so that people don't steal your images, that's it.
223

224
00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.660
for is so that people don't steal your images, that's it.
224

225
00:12:31.660 --> 00:12:35.230
So if someone takes it and they try to post it,
it's really, really hard to get rid of a watermark.
225

226
00:12:35.650 --> 00:12:38.610
So that's a little bit different than this,
I don't know why they call it a watermark,
226

227
00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:42.640
but regardless. All you have to do is upload a new watermark,
but the way you have to do it is you have to
227

228
00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:50.260
take your logo or your text and I suggest making it
white and then uploading as a PNG file, like a .png file.
228

229
00:12:50.260 --> 00:12:51.370
take your logo or your text and I suggest making it
white and then uploading as a PNG file, like a .png file.
229

230
00:12:51.370 --> 00:12:56.470
If you guys need help with that, I can show you how to do
that on Photoshop, there's a lot of easy ways of doing it.
230

231
00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.390
Basically what that means is it's a transparent image.
231

232
00:12:58.390 --> 00:13:01.800
There's nothing in the background, it's not bringing
in a bunch of random colors, and things like that,
232

233
00:13:01.810 --> 00:13:03.170
that's gonna make it really difficult.
233

234
00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:08.140
So I have the text if I wanted to do the text instead.
234

235
00:13:08.350 --> 00:13:11.960
That's pretty useful if you're planning
on making this a shareable thing.
235

236
00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:17.050
One thing that drives me nuts a little bit about Typorama
though is they don't have the option to do both.
236

237
00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:17.960
One thing that drives me nuts a little bit about Typorama
though is they don't have the option to do both.
237

238
00:13:17.980 --> 00:13:24.190
You can only do one watermark, which drives
me nuts, so I don't really know which one's the...
238

239
00:13:24.280 --> 00:13:29.920
Personally, I think I like the rocket, although it's
just like, this is probably something I wouldn't plan
239

240
00:13:29.920 --> 00:13:32.980
on people reposting, because they
wouldn't know what the rocket is.
240

241
00:13:32.980 --> 00:13:34.710
That's why I wish I could do both of these.
241

242
00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:41.010
But I guess what I could do is you could combine the two
and then just upload as one watermark, but whatever.
242

243
00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:45.610
OK, so let's say that I'm happy with this, and I could
say, OK, share, then what happens is I can do
243

244
00:13:45.610 --> 00:13:46.980
it directly on Instagram if you want.
244

245
00:13:46.990 --> 00:13:48.220
I generally don't suggest doing that.
245

246
00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.400
I generally suggest saving it to save a backup of it.
246

247
00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.860
You can use that later,
247

248
00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:56.380
it's just useful as assets, but you can also send it to other
people if you're working with other people to do this.
248

249
00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.850
it's just useful as assets, but you can also send it to other
people if you're working with other people to do this.
249

250
00:13:57.880 --> 00:14:00.040
Other than that, I'm just gonna hit save.
250

251
00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:00.710
OK.
251

252
00:14:00.730 --> 00:14:04.480
Also, keep in mind, you can always add
processing to it once you're done with it.
252

253
00:14:04.480 --> 00:14:08.290
You can just go to, say, Instagram's app,
and then play around with it.
253

254
00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:09.830
So, cool.
254

255
00:14:09.970 --> 00:14:10.180
OK.
255

256
00:14:10.210 --> 00:14:12.550
So, moving on over to Android.
256

257
00:14:12.550 --> 00:14:12.760
All right.
257

258
00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:17.920
So, on Android, I'm going to show you Wordswag,
and if you guys like Wordswag better, that's cool.
258

259
00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:21.650
You can find Wordswag on both systems actually.
259

260
00:14:21.670 --> 00:14:23.260
This is what Wordswag looks like.
260

261
00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:25.060
The camera button takes you to your camera.
261

262
00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:27.970
So if you want to take a photo and
then put text over it, it's great for that.
262

263
00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:33.760
Otherwise, you just hit that, and then we're going to
either use a camera roll image or one of their images.
263

264
00:14:33.840 --> 00:14:38.440
I'm just going to use one of their images just
because I think that's a little bit more useful.
264

265
00:14:38.530 --> 00:14:41.890
So they have a lot of great images.
265

266
00:14:41.890 --> 00:14:43.270
They also pull from Pixabay.
266

267
00:14:43.270 --> 00:14:45.890
So not a big difference there.
267

268
00:14:45.890 --> 00:14:48.240
This is actually my home screen on my phone.
268

269
00:14:48.250 --> 00:14:53.380
So why not? We'll use that.
So down here it has presets for you.
269

270
00:14:53.410 --> 00:14:56.480
Now, keep in mind, Instagram is the square.
270

271
00:14:56.500 --> 00:15:00.660
So use the square, and then you
can hit crop and it moves you on.
271

272
00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.160
OK.
272

273
00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.550
So the way you move your text, it's going
to walk you through it, which is great.
273

274
00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.130
It's just pinching, moving, and then twisting.
274

275
00:15:08.290 --> 00:15:12.130
So once it's done yelling at you, then you're done.
275

276
00:15:12.160 --> 00:15:12.430
OK.
276

277
00:15:12.430 --> 00:15:15.510
So it starts you off with some bare basic stuff.
277

278
00:15:15.670 --> 00:15:18.260
Same way that this works is as the other one.
278

279
00:15:18.310 --> 00:15:22.010
Basically, we have lots and lots of text types here.
279

280
00:15:22.210 --> 00:15:29.520
So, no, I don't want to like you. So they have
some in here that you have to either pay or like
280

281
00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.580
to unlock, which is a little annoying,
but most of this stuff is free. So, let's see.
281

282
00:15:36.350 --> 00:15:40.740
I would want to put something like a quote about
wonder in the world or something, I don't know.
282

283
00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.260
I would want to put something like a quote about
wonder in the world or something, I don't know.
283

284
00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.090
Okay.
284

285
00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:49.280
So I think that could probably work enough
to work with the background a little bit.
285

286
00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:49.720
Cool.
286

287
00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:49.960
Okay.
287

288
00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:53.330
So what the buttons over here,
the one, two, three, four, five is
288

289
00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:57.280
is that all text on here has different ways of being organized.
289

290
00:15:57.290 --> 00:16:00.080
There's different ways of breaking the line and sizing,
290

291
00:16:00.430 --> 00:16:03.520
and if you don't want to deal with that,
they have auto sets for you.
291

292
00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.380
So I can just change it like that, which is super useful
sometimes, because sometimes you're just looking
292

293
00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.440
at it, and you're like, "This just doesn't feel right."
293

294
00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.810
So you can do that, and then also this just randomizes
it, so you can play with that as much as you want.
294

295
00:16:16.810 --> 00:16:17.700
So you can do that, and then also this just randomizes
it, so you can play with that as much as you want.
295

296
00:16:17.770 --> 00:16:21.970
Usually, these ones are the ones they've made
beforehand, because they know they don't look bad.
296

297
00:16:22.450 --> 00:16:24.210
So I usually stick with those.
297

298
00:16:24.220 --> 00:16:31.520
But once you find that, we can go over to color,
and color is just going to apply to the text.
298

299
00:16:31.570 --> 00:16:33.480
Same thing, transparency, blah.
299

300
00:16:33.670 --> 00:16:37.030
You can pick your own color, again, this
is useful because you use the HEX code.
300

301
00:16:37.080 --> 00:16:37.670
OK.
301

302
00:16:38.050 --> 00:16:38.950
You can pick whatever you want.
302

303
00:16:38.950 --> 00:16:41.020
I like the fact that you can pick the HEX codes.
303

304
00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:48.670
You can also just do your text in these weird kind of
styles, like dotted lines, texturized styles are pretty cool.
304

305
00:16:48.670 --> 00:16:49.510
You can also just do your text in these weird kind of
styles, like dotted lines, texturized styles are pretty cool.
305

306
00:16:49.510 --> 00:16:53.090
Again, it's really going to depend on your
background, if something is way too heavy,
306

307
00:16:53.110 --> 00:16:54.190
then it's not going to matter.
307

308
00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.300
No one's gonna see it.
308

309
00:16:55.330 --> 00:16:57.290
Here's some pastels that can be useful.
309

310
00:16:57.290 --> 00:17:01.810
Again, you're going to have to have a really light
background to pull off a pastel kind of thing like that.
310

311
00:17:01.810 --> 00:17:04.390
You can also invert, which usually inverts the... yeah.
311

312
00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:05.260
You can also invert, which usually inverts the... yeah.
312

313
00:17:05.260 --> 00:17:05.950
There you go.
313

314
00:17:05.950 --> 00:17:06.550
That was weird.
314

315
00:17:06.550 --> 00:17:07.410
That just flips it.
315

316
00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.250
So it just puts the color in the background.
316

317
00:17:09.250 --> 00:17:14.170
I don't know why that's a button everybody would
want to have front and center, but whatever.
317

318
00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:30.140
Then, last thing is image, and they give
you just basic presets, so, sweet. Anyway,
318

319
00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:36.570
again, I'm not a huge filter dude, so this is up to you
guys if you want to use filters, adjust the brightness,
319

320
00:17:36.740 --> 00:17:37.350
again, I'm not a huge filter dude, so this is up to you
guys if you want to use filters, adjust the brightness,
320

321
00:17:37.350 --> 00:17:37.840
there you go.
321

322
00:17:37.840 --> 00:17:38.680
Pull that back.
322

323
00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:39.780
You can read the text.
323

324
00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:51.460
Then what you do is you just hit save and
there you go, done, like you just added it.
324

325
00:17:51.630 --> 00:17:52.470
They don't in their app allow you to add watermarks
immediately, which is perfectly fine.
325

326
00:17:52.710 --> 00:17:58.410
They don't in their app allow you to add watermarks
immediately, which is perfectly fine.
326

327
00:17:58.410 --> 00:18:04.500
What happens then as you go down to add logo /
watermark, so then takes you back, and you're basically
327

328
00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.120
just doing this one more time.
328

329
00:18:06.180 --> 00:18:10.750
Maybe you could just write your name in text,
I mean, you could also use an image,
329

330
00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:11.220
Maybe you could just write your name in text,
I mean, you could also use an image,
330

331
00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:14.810
just make sure that you have it
on your hard drive on your phone.
331

332
00:18:14.890 --> 00:18:21.000
Anyway, you could change the text like that, usually I do
auto line breaks. Over here it just gives you random 
332

333
00:18:21.270 --> 00:18:22.950
things that you can use.
333

334
00:18:22.950 --> 00:18:24.870
These are just quotes, things to play around with.
334

335
00:18:24.900 --> 00:18:26.340
They're pretty useful. Also, I mean,
they're all curated by emotion type.
335

336
00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:30.630
They're pretty useful. Also, I mean,
they're all curated by emotion type.
336

337
00:18:30.630 --> 00:18:34.860
So you see these on a lot of motivational
and "believe in your future self."
337

338
00:18:35.190 --> 00:18:37.950
"As I look back on my life..." I don't care.
338

339
00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.210
"What do you have until you want to do" whatever.
339

340
00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:43.380
Oprah Winfrey, great. Also you can put down here who quoted it.
340

341
00:18:43.380 --> 00:18:46.680
That's another thing, so it will automatically put a lower line.
341

342
00:18:46.680 --> 00:18:50.660
So if I wanted that Oprah quote, so you can see
it's like this, and it put Oprah at the bottom.
342

343
00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:50.940
OK.
343

344
00:18:51.030 --> 00:18:53.000
So, I mean, that's pretty much it.
344

345
00:18:53.080 --> 00:19:00.420
Wordswag, not as smooth and nice as
Typorama, but it works on both systems.
345

346
00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:05.830
Now, there are tons of these apps out there, like, if
there's another one you like better, or you're tempted
346

347
00:19:05.830 --> 00:19:09.210
to ask the question like, "Evan, is this app good for doing this?"
347

348
00:19:09.210 --> 00:19:09.760
Chances are, probably yes.
348

349
00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:10.320
Chances are, probably yes.
349

350
00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:10.720
I don't know.
350

351
00:19:10.730 --> 00:19:11.430
You have to try it.
351

352
00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.780
There's probably a hundred of them.
352

353
00:19:13.800 --> 00:19:21.330
If you just go on to the Play Store or on the App Store,
and you just say "Instagram photos" or "text on photo"
353

354
00:19:21.390 --> 00:19:25.830
then you just get tons and tons and tons of these, some
of these are pretty bad, to be honest, so you just have
354

355
00:19:25.830 --> 00:19:26.800
to play around with them.
355

356
00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:28.490
These are the two ones that everybody knows.
356

357
00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:28.790
OK.
357

358
00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.270
Hopefully this was helpful.
358

359
00:19:30.270 --> 00:19:33.030
Check them out if you think this is useful
for your workflow. Otherwise, moving on.
359

360
00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:33.570
Check them out if you think this is useful
for your workflow. Otherwise, moving on.
