00:00:00.340 --> 00:00:01.660
That you guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.680 --> 00:00:08.220
So we're checking in on the posts that we made before it at this point it's been like two hours.

3
00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:13.820
I want to say and there's about seven or eight people who have applied I imagine towards the end of

4
00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:18.350
this maybe 20 30 will apply especially going to pick someone and close it down.

5
00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:23.970
So some of the people as you know just didn't read the job posting that's pretty normal to be expected.

6
00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:29.010
So a lot of times I just responded with please read the job post or maybe I dropped the PLEASE.

7
00:00:29.010 --> 00:00:30.840
I'm not really sure.

8
00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:37.280
And then hopefully they go back and read it and see the last line has a trial in it.

9
00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:41.520
The trial again like we talked about for the whole idea was just to see that this is someone who can

10
00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.450
follow instructions.

11
00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:46.890
They can read the whole thing without applying and I don't want someone who just mass applying.

12
00:00:46.890 --> 00:00:51.490
Even if it has no relevancy to the skill set or what they think they can do.

13
00:00:51.780 --> 00:00:54.910
So I usually give them a second chance by saying read the job post please.

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:57.810
And sometimes they do sometimes they don't.

15
00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.400
One guy didn't even get it he's like yes I read the job.

16
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:03.180
It's like a kid who has to do a book report.

17
00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.830
They're like yes I wrote the book.

18
00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:06.190
Oh what's the book about.

19
00:01:06.300 --> 00:01:09.080
What is the book anyway so I found one.

20
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:10.510
His name is Omar.

21
00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:16.530
He did the trial and he gave me two options that were pretty good.

22
00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:18.270
I mean I checked them out right.

23
00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:19.350
Perfectly fine.

24
00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:20.050
They're English.

25
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.030
They're within the range.

26
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:25.980
They're all robotics or engineering so I thought those are pretty good snag so I started him on it three

27
00:01:25.980 --> 00:01:26.940
dollars an hour.

28
00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:32.610
That's pretty affordable special because I don't think it's he's going to spend more than an hour every

29
00:01:32.610 --> 00:01:34.350
other day doing this.

30
00:01:34.350 --> 00:01:35.700
I told them to get 200.

31
00:01:35.700 --> 00:01:37.960
But he ended up getting 50 whatever.

32
00:01:37.980 --> 00:01:38.490
That's fine.

33
00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:40.660
This is this is just part of the process.

34
00:01:40.740 --> 00:01:43.830
He didn't really understand what the contract rate was about.

35
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:45.420
So I said it was hourly.

36
00:01:45.420 --> 00:01:46.760
So he's asked for a milestone.

37
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:52.200
If you guys are unfamiliar milestones I typically use a fixed price projects because let's say you're

38
00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:53.960
going to pay someone a hundred bucks to do something.

39
00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.630
Well they don't want to only get paid 100 at the very end of it because who knows if you'll pay.

40
00:01:58.650 --> 00:02:04.110
They like to have milestones just to prove that you can pay and to give them deadlines and they have

41
00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:10.050
to hit now with really it doesn't really matter what he hits it's that he spends an hour doing something

42
00:02:10.050 --> 00:02:11.760
and he gets paid for his time.

43
00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:16.410
So he had to go back and forth and to kind of explain that to him and show him a screenshot of my account

44
00:02:16.410 --> 00:02:19.010
saying like hey dude it's fine to do that.

45
00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:21.300
And then we pretty much figured it out from there.

46
00:02:21.300 --> 00:02:24.550
Now one of the issues I ran into pretty much immediately.

47
00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:26.880
So let's look at the the list he's made.

48
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.820
He gave me fifty one just from going over these.

49
00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:34.680
Some were good but then some of them actually were the wrong language.

50
00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.330
Now I don't blame this on him.

51
00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:41.640
I just this is when I was talking about before where there's always something you haven't thought about

52
00:02:41.730 --> 00:02:45.440
and it's important to try first.

53
00:02:45.510 --> 00:02:51.220
And don't go dive headfirst into the deep end with hiring someone to do work.

54
00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:52.940
Do it make them do a small amount.

55
00:02:52.960 --> 00:02:56.960
Just you can see that we're on the same page as you can see we are not on the same page.

56
00:02:56.970 --> 00:03:02.250
Only one was wrong in terms of followers and this is this one where you put it at 88 thousand.

57
00:03:02.250 --> 00:03:07.590
I wanted to top out 75000 and the other thing was that these were different language accounts.

58
00:03:07.620 --> 00:03:09.090
I didn't tell them to get English.

59
00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.010
I just kind of forgot to mention that so I chalked it up to my fault.

60
00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:17.220
So what I'll have to do is go back and explain to him.

61
00:03:17.940 --> 00:03:18.480
So

62
00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.220
I started marking the list you made.

63
00:03:27.790 --> 00:03:39.510
Please only find English language like it's first for picked or your book or quirks.

64
00:03:39.900 --> 00:03:43.170
Geez now I don't think we're going to have any problems.

65
00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.680
I would have told him to correct this but other than that it looks like what he's picked was fine.

66
00:03:47.730 --> 00:03:51.310
Tech balloon is actually one I've actually message before.

67
00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:54.450
They're one of those ones I don't understand how they're growing so quickly.

68
00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:58.330
Something is going on there so we can look at some of the ones he gave us.

69
00:03:58.530 --> 00:04:06.010
So just go to Instagram so you will search for technology dition.

70
00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:10.330
I'm going to guess this is in English because it's the names in English that go through your head.

71
00:04:10.420 --> 00:04:15.180
And so they have a kick that's generally a good sign means they're probably two promotions.

72
00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:18.210
Looks are the only new iPhones but still.

73
00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.490
I mean it's a smaller audience.

74
00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.710
So this year like this one would be a good one.

75
00:04:22.770 --> 00:04:23.070
OK.

76
00:04:23.070 --> 00:04:29.760
So the second part of the process was I actually had someone else who I had hired for virtual assistance

77
00:04:29.760 --> 00:04:32.570
to then go and start messaging these.

78
00:04:33.210 --> 00:04:35.020
And so they really said contacted.

79
00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:38.940
And then we're going to start tracking if they responded and then see if we can actually get the promotions

80
00:04:38.940 --> 00:04:40.050
run.

81
00:04:40.050 --> 00:04:44.780
Now when you get him to clean up this list of new rules we'll get him to expand this so it's even longer.

82
00:04:44.790 --> 00:04:45.630
But it's up to you.

83
00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:47.720
I mean you could use the same person to send the messages.

84
00:04:47.730 --> 00:04:51.630
I thought it would be a little simpler if I didn't have yet another person constantly logging into my

85
00:04:51.630 --> 00:04:52.430
account.

86
00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:55.390
I don't want too many people logging in right now.

87
00:04:55.530 --> 00:05:03.190
Jarvi logs when I log in the person who's posting four times a day logs in and then a Virtual Assistant

88
00:05:03.190 --> 00:05:07.720
Project Manager slash project manager is doing the same thing so I just kind of get to a part I'm a

89
00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.980
good little concerned especially if someone in some random country that's the world is not related to

90
00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:15.730
the other ones is also longing and so that's what I did.

91
00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:18.430
But it's perfectly normal for you guys to do that.

92
00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:22.810
Just be careful that you know they might lock the account which is perfectly fine you just have to go

93
00:05:22.810 --> 00:05:28.120
in there and then use your phone to unlock it and then hopefully and scream to get to the point where

94
00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.820
it recognizes that this is a normal user they're tolerant of most white people using accounts because

95
00:05:33.820 --> 00:05:35.530
they understand that there's a lot of businesses on here.

96
00:05:35.530 --> 00:05:38.480
So it's actually the same IP address same person every single time.

97
00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:39.710
So just keep that in mind.

98
00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:44.140
OK so this is pretty much the beginnings of making a semi automatic outreach.

99
00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:50.200
I think this is probably going to be more fruitful than the other one just because we will get the accuracy

100
00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:57.250
to a point where it's actually good and with an actual human operator looking at this and sending messages

101
00:05:57.400 --> 00:05:58.660
we can make changes.

102
00:05:58.660 --> 00:06:02.590
Notice problems whereas with Jarvi it's all automatic.

103
00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:04.630
So you kind of have to just keep on a roll with it.

104
00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:05.250
But ok.

105
00:06:05.260 --> 00:06:07.350
I mean this is pretty fruitful.

106
00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:08.730
I'll have to start acting.

107
00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:12.780
You know maybe two hours worth a day or an hour or a day it's $3 day.

108
00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:18.550
So ideally we could add several hundred and then just start going through these and start messaging

109
00:06:18.550 --> 00:06:21.700
them and then slowly kind of tracking the process as they go.

110
00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:26.300
It'll probably end up doing is adding another column if they say no which is perfectly normal.

111
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:28.570
But I just want to make sure that don't message them again.

112
00:06:28.770 --> 00:06:29.130
OK.

113
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:31.800
So this is a semi-automatic way of doing it.

114
00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:36.910
You guys can use the exact same system I use you can even copy the job post just remember to mention

115
00:06:36.910 --> 00:06:39.310
that it needs to be in the same language as your account.

116
00:06:39.370 --> 00:06:39.870
OK.

117
00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:44.190
All right so with that being said let's move on to the fully automatic version.

118
00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:48.080
The Jarvi automatic outreach strategy.

119
00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:48.730
See that.
