All right guys welcome back.

2
00:00:01.860 --> 00:00:08.310
So this lecture what we're going to do is cover Instagram live and from where I'm speaking it's the

3
00:00:08.310 --> 00:00:10.700
newest thing they've come out with.

4
00:00:10.830 --> 00:00:15.150
And again it's just kind of a copy of Facebook love but it's fine because they're copying their parent

5
00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:15.910
company.

6
00:00:16.190 --> 00:00:21.720
Instagram live is an interesting thing and it kind of works like stories and it is a great way of getting

7
00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:23.430
engagement amongst the followers.

8
00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:30.900
You already have you can kind of tie it into some other strategies like giveaways for instance and like

9
00:00:31.020 --> 00:00:34.020
getting people to tag other people.

10
00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:37.680
But there's a very specific way to do it correctly.

11
00:00:37.680 --> 00:00:42.900
And so we're going to look at ways you can do it correctly accounts that are doing it correctly and

12
00:00:42.900 --> 00:00:46.550
then we'll talk a little bit how about how you can decide whether or not something that fits for you.

13
00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:51.270
Now for innovation sation business says up front it's probably not something that's going to work for

14
00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:53.210
our following account.

15
00:00:53.460 --> 00:00:58.950
So it's something I'll dabble with but I just can't imagine how it's going to work.

16
00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:03.910
We cover interesting technology so I don't know how.

17
00:01:04.110 --> 00:01:09.420
I don't know what I'm going to put on a live video but as you'll see in the section there are actually

18
00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:11.340
some options out there and we'll just see.

19
00:01:11.430 --> 00:01:13.350
All right on that somewhat disappointing note.

20
00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:14.090
The next lecture.
