00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
Hello there.

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:04.450
And welcome back to this spring development course.

00:00:04.450 --> 00:00:10.850
So last time we would over the very basics of being scopes that we're gonna be going into a

00:00:10.850 --> 00:00:12.580
little bit more detail about them.

00:00:12.580 --> 00:00:13.320
Um,

00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:16.370
but generally way covered pretty much everything,

00:00:16.370 --> 00:00:16.680
You know,

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:17.470
that you really,

00:00:17.470 --> 00:00:21.840
really need to know in the last lesson is going to be sort of a high level overview with

00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:27.340
some diagrams to really make sure you understand the concept and the next time we are

00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:32.080
moving on to NBC finally and,

00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:32.570
um,

00:00:32.570 --> 00:00:34.120
that actually get a lot more fun.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:37.670
I realize at this point that spring core isn't that fun,

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:37.950
since,

00:00:37.950 --> 00:00:38.130
you know,

00:00:38.130 --> 00:00:43.590
essentially just creating jobs objects in XML instead of just creating them manually.

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:46.040
And so it's just dependency injection,

00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.370
so it can't get little bit boring.

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.590
Don't worry about that.

00:00:48.590 --> 00:00:49.590
We're gonna get into M.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:49.770
V.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:49.960
C.

00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:50.790
U next episode,

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:52.600
and that's gonna be a lot more fun.

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:53.020
So,

00:00:53.020 --> 00:00:53.310
yeah,

00:00:53.310 --> 00:00:58.610
let's just get to this episode to get to the NBC to get to the to get to their promised

00:00:58.610 --> 00:00:58.950
land.

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:00.250
All right away.

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:02.380
Let's go over exactly what I'm talking about.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:04.250
All right,

00:01:04.250 --> 00:01:04.610
scope.

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.080
So we've already gone over the basic scopes in spring envies in spring.

00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:11.150
So we have Singleton scopes.

00:01:11.150 --> 00:01:11.540
Ah,

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.140
single being definition to a single object essence per spring.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:16.180
I have sea containers.

00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:17.100
This just means that,

00:01:17.100 --> 00:01:23.140
um there's gonna be a single object gonna be created immediately as soon as the file is

00:01:23.140 --> 00:01:24.580
created on.

00:01:24.580 --> 00:01:26.260
And then after that,

00:01:26.260 --> 00:01:27.470
when we need an object,

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:29.300
it will return that given object.

00:01:29.300 --> 00:01:30.190
Okay,

00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:30.760
prototype.

00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:34.150
We have scope the single being definition to any number of object instances.

00:01:34.150 --> 00:01:40.000
So this just means that we create the object itself and call the objects constructor.

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.370
Whenever we request that actual bean,

00:01:44.370 --> 00:01:50.310
then we have request scoops a single being definition toe the life cycle of a single.

00:01:50.310 --> 00:01:50.790
Http.

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:58.460
Request this is e each and every http request will have its own instance of a being created

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.000
off off the back of a single being definition on leave at valid in the context of a web

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.500
aware spring application contact.

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.700
So we'll go over exactly what that means later on.

00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:08.350
For now,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:12.930
we really want you to know is that this is a being that created every single time a request

00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:13.980
is sent to the server.

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:14.980
So yeah,

00:02:14.980 --> 00:02:16.010
if we have a Web server,

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:16.840
and we you know,

00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:19.360
actress it youtube dot com It creates a new being friends,

00:02:19.360 --> 00:02:19.900
for example.

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.100
All right,

00:02:21.100 --> 00:02:26.800
so session scopes a single being definition to the life cycle of a http session on Lee

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:30.080
valid in the context of a web aware spring application context.

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.410
It just means that every single time our Sachin is,

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:34.960
um,

00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:37.670
sort of recreated.

00:02:37.670 --> 00:02:38.560
It's gonna create new being,

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.690
so,

00:02:38.690 --> 00:02:38.940
you know,

00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:42.340
you know how if you maybe love onto an online bank or something,

00:02:42.340 --> 00:02:43.250
Um,

00:02:43.250 --> 00:02:44.470
eventually,

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.200
you may leave your computer,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.580
and then you come back to it and it says Session expired.

00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:49.180
Well,

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.780
that essentially the session that we're talking about succession expires and would create a

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:53.280
new session.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.150
It creates a new bean.

00:02:54.150 --> 00:02:54.820
Yes.

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:55.000
That's,

00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:55.440
um,

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:56.510
HDP session being.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:01.340
And then we have a global session scopes a single being definition to the life cycle of a

00:03:01.340 --> 00:03:03.200
global http session difficult.

00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.360
Only valid when used in a Portland concept.

00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:07.150
So this is a little bit more advanced.

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:12.230
We might touch upon this in this course we might not brought Yeah,

00:03:12.230 --> 00:03:13.110
you know that exists.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:13.870
And if you see it,

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:17.800
you know that it is essentially a global session.

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:20.880
You'll know that you'll at least have heard of it before.

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:21.780
All right.

00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:22.230
Anyway,

00:03:22.230 --> 00:03:22.690
um,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:24.060
let's move on sessions.

00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:24.570
I mean,

00:03:24.570 --> 00:03:24.790
no,

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:25.990
not session scopes.

00:03:25.990 --> 00:03:28.440
Singleton.

00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:35.740
So when a bean is a singleton Onley one shared instance of the bean will be managed and all

00:03:35.740 --> 00:03:41.050
requests for beings with an i d or I ds matching that being definition will result in that

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:44.490
one specific being instance being returned by the spring container.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:45.900
So what does this mean?

00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:46.250
Well,

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:48.010
right here we have,

00:03:48.010 --> 00:03:48.450
you know,

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:50.240
account Dow class.

00:03:50.240 --> 00:03:57.390
Um and we want to essentially get that being I d evil account down essentially what?

00:03:57.390 --> 00:04:02.300
That means that every single time we refer to this,

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:03.300
I d.

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:05.510
It will be created.

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:09.270
It will give back the same exact being.

00:04:09.270 --> 00:04:10.320
So what did this mean?

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:10.630
Well,

00:04:10.630 --> 00:04:12.190
if we have this here,

00:04:12.190 --> 00:04:15.420
we have a ref account down right to it will refer to this being here.

00:04:15.420 --> 00:04:16.090
So what?

00:04:16.090 --> 00:04:19.950
This means that no matter how many times we referred to it in a file,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:23.680
it's still going to call the constructor of account Dow Onley.

00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:25.850
Once de makes sense.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.630
There's no way for you enter that.

00:04:28.630 --> 00:04:29.090
But yeah,

00:04:29.090 --> 00:04:29.990
I open accents.

00:04:29.990 --> 00:04:30.550
Essentially,

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:32.600
what that means is that it's created,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.410
and then every single time we access it,

00:04:34.410 --> 00:04:36.110
it just returns that given,

00:04:36.110 --> 00:04:36.790
you know,

00:04:36.790 --> 00:04:40.530
file no being very that is already created.

00:04:40.530 --> 00:04:42.710
So it doesn't call the constructor again.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:48.210
It returns that file that being giving factory all right to put another way when you're

00:04:48.210 --> 00:04:53.390
defined a being definition and it is scoped as a singleton than the spring IOC container

00:04:53.390 --> 00:04:57.990
will create exactly one instance of the object defined by that being definition.

00:04:57.990 --> 00:05:04.080
This single instance will be stored in a cache of such single to beans and all subsequent

00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:09.350
requests and references for that named Bean will result in the cash objects being returned

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.350
.

00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:09.980
So,

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:10.310
yeah,

00:05:10.310 --> 00:05:11.130
singleton.

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:11.770
Pretty simple.

00:05:11.770 --> 00:05:13.880
It's a default to be articulated in the last lesson.

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.250
Go prototype.

00:05:15.250 --> 00:05:17.860
Um,

00:05:17.860 --> 00:05:18.470
prototype.

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:19.000
Um,

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.590
the non singleton prototype scope of being deployment results in the creation of a new

00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:28.950
being instance every time a request for that specific being is made,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.050
Um,

00:05:30.050 --> 00:05:32.240
that is it is injected into another being,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.220
or it is requested via a programmatic get being method.

00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:37.400
Carl on the container.

00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:38.490
All right,

00:05:38.490 --> 00:05:44.340
so I understand that this is actually a lot of its from the official spring documentation.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:52.510
But is that just what this just means is that every single time we call account down here

00:05:52.510 --> 00:05:55.470
every single time it will create a new object,

00:05:55.470 --> 00:05:56.620
it will call the constructor.

00:05:56.620 --> 00:05:58.160
So if you had in your constructor,

00:05:58.160 --> 00:05:58.730
if you had,

00:05:58.730 --> 00:05:59.090
you know,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:03.670
print calling constructor and we referred to it three times,

00:06:03.670 --> 00:06:06.330
it would print three times calling.

00:06:06.330 --> 00:06:10.580
So it we would print calling constructor three times since it would call the constructor

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:16.680
three times by by creating three different beings or through different objects.

00:06:16.680 --> 00:06:17.880
Um,

00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.970
while with the single 10 scope,

00:06:19.970 --> 00:06:21.800
it would if we refer to it three times,

00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:23.730
it would call the constructor only once,

00:06:23.730 --> 00:06:25.950
since it would create only one object.

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:27.440
All right.

00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:28.610
As a rule of thumb,

00:06:28.610 --> 00:06:31.370
you should use the prototype scope for all beings that are state full.

00:06:31.370 --> 00:06:31.560
Well,

00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:34.270
that singleton scope should be used for stateless beans,

00:06:34.270 --> 00:06:39.980
which essentially just means that if a bean will have a certain state than you should use,

00:06:39.980 --> 00:06:40.650
um,

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:46.370
Perez type and if it doesn't think should use stateless.

00:06:46.370 --> 00:06:51.010
So I'm understanding where exactly which one to use is again a little bit more of an

00:06:51.010 --> 00:06:51.720
advanced topic.

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.470
But as you will be using them.

00:06:53.470 --> 00:06:57.150
You will start start to understand what exactly you choose Where?

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:57.950
All right.

00:06:57.950 --> 00:06:59.440
Okay,

00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.450
So that essentially the singleton and prototype beans.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:05.550
And so there's really no homework for this last necessary.

00:07:05.550 --> 00:07:09.550
Essentially did all the code for it in the last lesson.

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:14.160
So we're gonna go ahead and move on to spring NBC.

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.340
No homework.

00:07:15.340 --> 00:07:19.190
Understand what we did last time since that.

00:07:19.190 --> 00:07:20.150
Essentially the code.

00:07:20.150 --> 00:07:21.010
And then,

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:22.770
um yeah,

00:07:22.770 --> 00:07:23.450
pretty simple.

00:07:23.450 --> 00:07:24.400
Anyway,

00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.580
without further ado,

00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.590
if you don't understand what Singleton and prototype is,

00:07:29.590 --> 00:07:31.450
go to the last lesson in the code.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:33.310
Replicated as I said,

00:07:33.310 --> 00:07:34.410
if you do,

00:07:34.410 --> 00:07:35.240
that's great.

00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:37.450
We can move on to spring NBC without a problem.

00:07:37.450 --> 00:07:38.260
So,

00:07:38.260 --> 00:07:38.420
uh,

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:38.730
yeah,

00:07:38.730 --> 00:07:39.250
I'll see there.
