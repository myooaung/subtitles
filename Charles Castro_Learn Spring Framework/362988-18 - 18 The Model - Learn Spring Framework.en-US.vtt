00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.590
Hello.

00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:02.760
There are no come back to this spring development course.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:06.040
So last time we went over the dispatcher serve it.

00:00:06.040 --> 00:00:08.890
And today we're gonna be going over the model in spring.

00:00:08.890 --> 00:00:10.470
So essentially,

00:00:10.470 --> 00:00:15.350
the model is entirely just something that helps us past data from our controllers into our

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:15.900
views.

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:17.550
Pretty simple stuff.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.450
So it's going Take a look at how are deputies works.

00:00:20.450 --> 00:00:22.490
All right,

00:00:22.490 --> 00:00:26.980
So the model is a convenience class made for passing data into a view.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:31.560
We have a couple of implementations of the model should we will go over today.

00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:32.650
All right,

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:33.930
so the model,

00:00:33.930 --> 00:00:34.330
first of all,

00:00:34.330 --> 00:00:35.640
we just have just a model.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.710
So let's start with the most basic concept here.

00:00:37.710 --> 00:00:38.250
The model.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:39.280
Simply put,

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:45.940
the model can supply attributes used for rendering views to provide a view use with usable

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:46.490
data.

00:00:46.490 --> 00:00:49.560
We simply add this data to its model object.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:50.340
Additionally,

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:53.090
maps with actually can be merged with model instances.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:54.950
So here we have a controller.

00:00:54.950 --> 00:00:57.370
We have a at get mapping annotation,

00:00:57.370 --> 00:00:59.980
which is essentially sort of like a request mapping annotation.

00:00:59.980 --> 00:01:01.070
Um,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:02.740
with with slash get hello,

00:01:02.740 --> 00:01:03.200
world.

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:05.190
Then we have a public string.

00:01:05.190 --> 00:01:08.550
So we returned the name of the view past parameters with model.

00:01:08.550 --> 00:01:12.210
And then here we input a model into this controller.

00:01:12.210 --> 00:01:13.020
And remember,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:13.850
the dispatcher serve.

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:15.990
It will sense that we have a model here,

00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:16.840
um,

00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:20.280
as the input for a method and automatically passing a model.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:26.420
Then when we go ahead and we can we create a new map here on new hash map and then put a

00:01:26.420 --> 00:01:27.550
sample string here,

00:01:27.550 --> 00:01:30.450
Then we add and actually torn model.

00:01:30.450 --> 00:01:32.620
We do hello and world.

00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:33.670
So the key hello.

00:01:33.670 --> 00:01:37.730
And in that the value is world,

00:01:37.730 --> 00:01:38.900
and then we also merge,

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:39.780
attribute with maps.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:45.950
So then model will now have sample Ah kee sample value string as well and then we return

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:47.050
the actual view itself.

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.240
So this is just an example here of how it really works.

00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:50.510
But really,

00:01:50.510 --> 00:01:53.780
the important thing to note here is that we can just add Actually,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:57.200
it's to our model using modeled on at at add attribute.

00:01:57.200 --> 00:01:57.910
Hello,

00:01:57.910 --> 00:01:58.650
comma world.

00:01:58.650 --> 00:01:59.620
So you know,

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:01.000
key and their value as well.

00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.390
So let's take a look at how this will work in our code.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:04.790
All right?

00:02:04.790 --> 00:02:07.790
So in our project code that we have already created,

00:02:07.790 --> 00:02:12.710
we're gonna go on and do is do new class.

00:02:12.710 --> 00:02:14.020
Let's call it.

00:02:14.020 --> 00:02:14.650
Hello,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:17.850
world controller.

00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:20.670
There we go.

00:02:20.670 --> 00:02:23.450
I was pretty main method as well.

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:26.390
Arsenal wide accretive main breath,

00:02:26.390 --> 00:02:27.280
Don't you Two main method.

00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:27.640
All right,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.350
let's do at request mapping.

00:02:30.350 --> 00:02:32.860
No,

00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:33.600
What's what am I doing?

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.070
Not know.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:34.510
And of course,

00:02:34.510 --> 00:02:36.280
at controller there ago.

00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.640
Can't.

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.560
Can't think today.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:38.970
There we go.

00:02:38.970 --> 00:02:39.810
Import controller.

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.310
OK,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:41.510
now we're going to act.

00:02:41.510 --> 00:02:48.680
Request mapping and then here we're gonna do slash.

00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:51.290
Um hello,

00:02:51.290 --> 00:02:51.750
world.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.640
All right,

00:02:56.640 --> 00:02:56.960
there we go.

00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:59.410
Else created public string.

00:02:59.410 --> 00:03:05.250
Get a little world take a model map as input.

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:05.950
No.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:06.090
What?

00:03:06.090 --> 00:03:08.690
Just a model has input model model.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:09.550
There we go.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:14.750
Let's import at request mapping and let's import model is Well,

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:15.850
there we go.

00:03:15.850 --> 00:03:16.650
Okay.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:18.250
And now we're gonna do is we're gonna do model,

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:25.590
don't add attribute and we're gonna dio for the key.

00:03:25.590 --> 00:03:31.450
We're gonna dio message and then for the value we're gonna do.

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:31.920
Hello,

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:32.250
world.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:34.210
There we go.

00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:36.160
All right.

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:37.550
And now let's return.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.250
Ah,

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:40.810
view.

00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.200
Right there we go.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.440
Okay,

00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:47.480
So it's going to take a look at a resource at our view.

00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:50.650
Resolve er inside our spring NBC several XML.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:51.770
Yes,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.980
I already have the weapon if they're switching to create a view in the weapons.

00:03:54.980 --> 00:04:01.390
So it's do new jsp file and we'll call it view dot jsp.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:04.420
Let's finish.

00:04:04.420 --> 00:04:05.800
All right,

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:06.320
there we go.

00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:06.840
And now here,

00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.410
we can do,

00:04:07.410 --> 00:04:17.750
um p message equals and then dollar sign and brackets message.

00:04:17.750 --> 00:04:21.950
There we go.

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:22.410
All right,

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:26.510
So now we have used this model attributes to know.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:26.780
Yeah,

00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:31.640
this model to put on attributes message into Hello world.

00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:32.520
And so here,

00:04:32.520 --> 00:04:36.560
when we interview when we search for this message in our model,

00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:38.830
it will return how the world's let's make sure that it works.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:39.660
Let's go to run this.

00:04:39.660 --> 00:04:44.310
All right,

00:04:44.310 --> 00:04:45.750
then it should start up.

00:04:45.750 --> 00:04:50.540
All right,

00:04:50.540 --> 00:04:51.110
there we go.

00:04:51.110 --> 00:04:57.910
All right,

00:04:57.910 --> 00:04:58.460
there we go.

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:58.940
So,

00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:03.800
server startup in 69,400 6944 milliseconds.

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:04.950
I was gonna go to chrome.

00:05:04.950 --> 00:05:06.500
All right,

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:06.750
Here,

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:07.310
let's do,

00:05:07.310 --> 00:05:07.960
um,

00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:16.810
local host 80 80 slash I think it was Web artifact slash.

00:05:16.810 --> 00:05:17.140
Hello,

00:05:17.140 --> 00:05:17.550
world.

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.750
Yeah.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:20.850
Ah,

00:05:20.850 --> 00:05:21.230
whoops.

00:05:21.230 --> 00:05:21.740
For some reason.

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.430
Didn't find it.

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.250
Let's see what our controller actually wasn't going clips here.

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.400
Um,

00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:28.250
our controller was out.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:28.540
Whoops.

00:05:28.540 --> 00:05:29.450
If you've got this Oh,

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:30.250
here it actually,

00:05:30.250 --> 00:05:31.560
I'm gonna Chrome,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:32.890
We cannot delete this.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:33.220
Oh,

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:34.350
here and now.

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:36.520
Uh,

00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:36.860
well,

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:38.000
that's that's odd.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:38.600
Um,

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.370
it's gonna go to eclipse again.

00:05:40.370 --> 00:05:41.850
Um,

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:47.420
God's going to restart the server.

00:05:47.420 --> 00:05:48.060
Just Teoh.

00:05:48.060 --> 00:05:55.980
See what the problem exactly is so It appears that All right,

00:05:55.980 --> 00:05:56.470
let's get started.

00:05:56.470 --> 00:05:59.950
You don't really know when spring might,

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:00.240
you know,

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:03.270
decided to give you some SAS.

00:06:03.270 --> 00:06:06.120
All right.

00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:08.430
Loading their egos to get point.

00:06:08.430 --> 00:06:08.910
Hello,

00:06:08.910 --> 00:06:09.200
World.

00:06:09.200 --> 00:06:09.480
Right here.

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:10.550
So a map to the world.

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:11.750
Here we go.

00:06:11.750 --> 00:06:14.550
Okay.

00:06:14.550 --> 00:06:16.350
It's now inside Chrome.

00:06:16.350 --> 00:06:21.250
Now we should be able to go to the world,

00:06:21.250 --> 00:06:25.530
and there we go.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.490
So now we see that our message is equal to hello world.

00:06:28.490 --> 00:06:29.130
So,

00:06:29.130 --> 00:06:29.700
um,

00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:33.670
let's go to our eclipse.

00:06:33.670 --> 00:06:34.220
You here.

00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:35.470
So here we have.

00:06:35.470 --> 00:06:35.820
Ah,

00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:39.810
p tag with message is equal to on ah,

00:06:39.810 --> 00:06:40.760
dollar sign messages.

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.870
A dollar sign message will essentially just look into our model and get back and attributes

00:06:45.870 --> 00:06:46.900
which,

00:06:46.900 --> 00:06:49.480
uh is under the key message.

00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:50.640
So which has the key message,

00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:51.710
and we'll get back the value.

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:52.890
So in our case,

00:06:52.890 --> 00:06:58.050
it gets back how the world since we put hello world here under message in our model.

00:06:58.050 --> 00:06:59.310
Okay,

00:06:59.310 --> 00:07:02.350
um and So remember when J.

00:07:02.350 --> 00:07:04.920
J Speed is just compiled down to surveillance,

00:07:04.920 --> 00:07:07.070
And so what is compared down to a serval?

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:11.250
It essentially just I understand that this is in the model and gets as well.

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:12.400
Okay,

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:17.120
So now take a look at how we can merge our model with a Hashmat.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:18.180
All right,

00:07:18.180 --> 00:07:18.610
so now hello,

00:07:18.610 --> 00:07:19.540
World Controller.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:20.660
That's going to stop our server.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:21.520
Um,

00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:22.900
we're going to create a new hash map,

00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:24.450
so we're gonna have a map.

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:25.840
What?

00:07:25.840 --> 00:07:29.050
Sweeps sweeps M equals new Hashmat.

00:07:29.050 --> 00:07:31.280
All right,

00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:32.450
our let's import map.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:36.030
Then let's import hash mapas.

00:07:36.030 --> 00:07:36.350
Well,

00:07:36.350 --> 00:07:37.720
there we go.

00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:39.170
And now let's do,

00:07:39.170 --> 00:07:39.840
um,

00:07:39.840 --> 00:07:40.770
remember a map,

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:41.160
essentially,

00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:41.570
just,

00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:42.170
ah,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.970
data structure in job I that has a key in the values.

00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:45.540
Just eventually,

00:07:45.540 --> 00:07:46.360
pretty much like a model.

00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:49.530
Except Hashmat actually stores under a hash code.

00:07:49.530 --> 00:07:49.730
But,

00:07:49.730 --> 00:07:49.980
you know,

00:07:49.980 --> 00:07:50.720
especially,

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:51.350
just came about,

00:07:51.350 --> 00:07:52.340
okay?

00:07:52.340 --> 00:07:54.570
And so now we can do am dot Uh,

00:07:54.570 --> 00:07:59.510
don't set what's Nope m dot Put there we go.

00:07:59.510 --> 00:08:00.750
Forgot the method there.

00:08:00.750 --> 00:08:02.190
M dot Put.

00:08:02.190 --> 00:08:04.240
Um let's just put out a message.

00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:07.230
One message one.

00:08:07.230 --> 00:08:10.750
And for the value we're gonna have goodbye world,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:13.620
okay?

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:19.650
And now we can do model dot merge attributes.

00:08:19.650 --> 00:08:21.450
And so listen,

00:08:21.450 --> 00:08:27.610
this will merge our model with our map m So now inside our of,

00:08:27.610 --> 00:08:30.750
you know jsp But I'm going to put another message one here.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:31.620
It's a message.

00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:32.860
One is equal to message one.

00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:34.890
So now it's going to save this starter server.

00:08:34.890 --> 00:08:45.870
Wait for it to start up starting several it engine loading XML me definition mapped your

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:46.250
There we go.

00:08:46.250 --> 00:08:46.960
Alright.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:48.750
Sounds going and go to chrome.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:54.650
And now let's go to hello world And there we go.

00:08:54.650 --> 00:08:57.320
So now we have our message here as hello world.

00:08:57.320 --> 00:08:59.880
And then our message one here as Good Bye World.

00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:00.490
Since that is,

00:09:00.490 --> 00:09:01.700
we put under message.

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:09.360
That is what we put under message one when we actually created our our No.

00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:09.720
When?

00:09:09.720 --> 00:09:15.010
When we great our what is what is called controller?

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.420
There we go.

00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:21.350
So in request mapping So here we have map M hash map We put in message one goodbye world.

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:27.450
Then we merge it with our model and so in our model and actually get back gets back,

00:09:27.450 --> 00:09:32.550
um Message one with the value Goodbye world.

00:09:32.550 --> 00:09:33.500
Okay,

00:09:33.500 --> 00:09:37.270
so let's take a look at the model map which says it just makes it,

00:09:37.270 --> 00:09:37.720
you know,

00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.060
combine these two things.

00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:40.420
All right,

00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:46.270
So just like the model interface above model map is also used to pass values to rend review

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:46.270
.

00:09:46.270 --> 00:09:50.530
The advantage of the advantage of model map is it gives us the ability to pass a collection

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:53.900
of values and treat these values as if they were within a map.

00:09:53.900 --> 00:10:00.650
So here we have map dot add attribute message for the world and then mad dot at attribute

00:10:00.650 --> 00:10:03.250
message to High World that we have two attributes here.

00:10:03.250 --> 00:10:05.130
But inside our model now,

00:10:05.130 --> 00:10:08.970
we can also add a collection of variables of values as well.

00:10:08.970 --> 00:10:10.890
We're gonna take a look at how we can do that.

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:11.990
All right,

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.800
so it's gonna take a look at how we can use it was going to lead all of this.

00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.250
So a model map is essentially just,

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:17.780
ah,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.370
model attributes,

00:10:19.370 --> 00:10:21.740
but that also whips model.

00:10:21.740 --> 00:10:25.560
But that also is that it's actually just implements for my doing.

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:26.190
What are we doing?

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:29.110
It actually implements met.

00:10:29.110 --> 00:10:30.100
So the map interface.

00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:34.060
So if you have no anything about Joe and data structures,

00:10:34.060 --> 00:10:38.180
you you actually know that there's a map interface on were actually look to go look at it

00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:38.820
just now.

00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:40.240
When you create a hash map,

00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:42.410
this is actually a model maps we can actually do.

00:10:42.410 --> 00:10:46.850
You actually do map M equals new model map,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:47.750
for example.

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:49.150
All right.

00:10:49.150 --> 00:10:49.670
And there we go.

00:10:49.670 --> 00:10:51.890
So you'll see that model map is actually ah,

00:10:51.890 --> 00:10:53.800
class that extends maps.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:55.750
We go actually go toe it to the source code.

00:10:55.750 --> 00:10:56.960
Or actually,

00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:57.070
no,

00:10:57.070 --> 00:10:58.950
we can't go whether we go down it.

00:10:58.950 --> 00:10:59.240
All right,

00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.150
so you'll see.

00:11:00.150 --> 00:11:05.220
It actually extends linked Hashmat so essentially also extends.

00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:06.310
And in doing so,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.090
it also extends map.

00:11:08.090 --> 00:11:11.090
So since linked hash map extends,

00:11:11.090 --> 00:11:13.510
you know it doesn't extend anything.

00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:13.790
Yeah,

00:11:13.790 --> 00:11:14.700
yeah,

00:11:14.700 --> 00:11:14.910
I know.

00:11:14.910 --> 00:11:16.150
It's extends Hashmat,

00:11:16.150 --> 00:11:19.410
which in turn extends implements map.

00:11:19.410 --> 00:11:19.910
There we go.

00:11:19.910 --> 00:11:20.370
OK,

00:11:20.370 --> 00:11:21.390
finally,

00:11:21.390 --> 00:11:21.850
we got to it.

00:11:21.850 --> 00:11:23.050
Essentially,

00:11:23.050 --> 00:11:25.850
model map is actually an implementation of map.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.230
Okay.

00:11:27.230 --> 00:11:27.870
Um,

00:11:27.870 --> 00:11:29.420
anyway,

00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:31.300
we can now do model dots,

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:32.610
add attribute,

00:11:32.610 --> 00:11:35.350
attribute.

00:11:35.350 --> 00:11:36.440
Ah,

00:11:36.440 --> 00:11:37.670
and then here we could have,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:38.190
um,

00:11:38.190 --> 00:11:39.450
message.

00:11:39.450 --> 00:11:42.050
And the message would be high.

00:11:42.050 --> 00:11:43.350
Okay.

00:11:43.350 --> 00:11:46.410
And then let's to modelled are at a tribute.

00:11:46.410 --> 00:11:49.350
Add whoops.

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:52.650
Add tribute.

00:11:52.650 --> 00:11:54.050
There we go.

00:11:54.050 --> 00:11:58.250
Message message one.

00:11:58.250 --> 00:12:01.850
It's gonna be good.

00:12:01.850 --> 00:12:02.150
Bye.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:02.980
Oops.

00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:04.450
Good bye.

00:12:04.450 --> 00:12:05.540
All right,

00:12:05.540 --> 00:12:06.020
there we go.

00:12:06.020 --> 00:12:06.340
OK.

00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.410
And so now we can actually going to run this,

00:12:08.410 --> 00:12:09.580
uh,

00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:14.480
one quick thing I wanted to know as well if we actually do a model M here.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:17.050
If we do m dot weaken do as map.

00:12:17.050 --> 00:12:19.210
But if we do model,

00:12:19.210 --> 00:12:20.560
we can't do as map,

00:12:20.560 --> 00:12:22.250
since it already is technically a map.

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:24.590
So just one thing to note.

00:12:24.590 --> 00:12:25.390
Okay,

00:12:25.390 --> 00:12:26.320
so if we have a hash map,

00:12:26.320 --> 00:12:28.220
we can just convert it to more.

00:12:28.220 --> 00:12:29.240
Okay,

00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:29.760
um,

00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:30.270
signals going,

00:12:30.270 --> 00:12:30.710
actually.

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:31.400
Run this.

00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:33.630
We'll see what we get.

00:12:33.630 --> 00:12:34.780
Spoiler alert.

00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.560
It's actually gonna get do the exact same thing every day just before with the regular

00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:38.900
model.

00:12:38.900 --> 00:12:40.150
Okay.

00:12:40.150 --> 00:12:41.970
All right.

00:12:41.970 --> 00:12:42.310
There we go.

00:12:42.310 --> 00:12:42.680
Start up.

00:12:42.680 --> 00:12:42.760
Now,

00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:43.450
let's go to Chrome.

00:12:43.450 --> 00:12:45.980
Here we are going to refresh.

00:12:45.980 --> 00:12:50.110
There we go.

00:12:50.110 --> 00:12:51.610
So we have message equals high.

00:12:51.610 --> 00:12:57.210
And the message one equals goodbye since in our oops model.

00:12:57.210 --> 00:12:58.990
Here we add attribute message.

00:12:58.990 --> 00:12:59.450
Hi.

00:12:59.450 --> 00:13:01.120
Message one goodbye.

00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:06.600
And then we get them using the dollar sign brackets here inside our JSP file.

00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:08.170
All right,

00:13:08.170 --> 00:13:09.860
so that's actually how we use the model map.

00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:12.210
Now it's going to take a look at model and view.

00:13:12.210 --> 00:13:12.880
All right,

00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:13.560
so model interview.

00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.140
So the final interface To pass values to a view is the model and view.

00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:22.530
This interface allows us to press all the information required by spring MBC in one return

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:22.530
.

00:13:22.530 --> 00:13:24.570
So here have our game.

00:13:24.570 --> 00:13:26.020
I think my get mapping annotation.

00:13:26.020 --> 00:13:26.460
Then here,

00:13:26.460 --> 00:13:30.320
instead of returning a string with the name of the view,

00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.810
we actually just have a model and view.

00:13:32.810 --> 00:13:34.280
So we return a model and view.

00:13:34.280 --> 00:13:35.380
Then,

00:13:35.380 --> 00:13:36.160
um,

00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:37.700
we create a model in view,

00:13:37.700 --> 00:13:38.830
and inside the constructor,

00:13:38.830 --> 00:13:41.490
we can actually insert the name of the view.

00:13:41.490 --> 00:13:46.020
We can actually offset it manually by doing model and view dot set view.

00:13:46.020 --> 00:13:49.210
But we can also do it in the constructors.

00:13:49.210 --> 00:13:49.500
Well,

00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.270
never get also at an object to it,

00:13:51.270 --> 00:13:51.820
for example,

00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:52.000
you know,

00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:52.630
message here.

00:13:52.630 --> 00:13:52.930
Hello,

00:13:52.930 --> 00:13:53.320
world.

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:55.130
And then we could just return the model in view.

00:13:55.130 --> 00:14:00.560
And instead of returning a string with the name of our view,

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:02.130
we could just return a model in view.

00:14:02.130 --> 00:14:02.520
And then,

00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:02.700
you know,

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:05.410
that has both the model and the view inside it.

00:14:05.410 --> 00:14:06.080
Um,

00:14:06.080 --> 00:14:09.700
and so this actually a convenience feature so that we can,

00:14:09.700 --> 00:14:09.930
you know,

00:14:09.930 --> 00:14:11.150
create just one variable?

00:14:11.150 --> 00:14:12.460
Yeah,

00:14:12.460 --> 00:14:15.000
one of variable and then just returned that instead of returning,

00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.310
having a model and then,

00:14:16.310 --> 00:14:17.670
um,

00:14:17.670 --> 00:14:20.280
a model and then a,

00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:20.700
uh,

00:14:20.700 --> 00:14:22.650
view separately.

00:14:22.650 --> 00:14:24.690
So it's going to take a look at how,

00:14:24.690 --> 00:14:27.250
exactly we can implement that in our coat.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:28.350
All right.

00:14:28.350 --> 00:14:33.060
The first thing we're gonna do is actually gonna do change this string to a model and view

00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:34.190
here.

00:14:34.190 --> 00:14:35.780
Let's go to import it.

00:14:35.780 --> 00:14:37.500
There we go.

00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:38.300
Okay,

00:14:38.300 --> 00:14:39.650
I'll delete this model map.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:41.050
Okay?

00:14:41.050 --> 00:14:43.160
And now what we can do is weaken Dio,

00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:43.750
um,

00:14:43.750 --> 00:14:46.350
model and view,

00:14:46.350 --> 00:14:47.890
uh,

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:48.500
model.

00:14:48.500 --> 00:14:53.860
And if you equals new model and few now,

00:14:53.860 --> 00:14:55.970
we can't pass the view name into the constructor here.

00:14:55.970 --> 00:14:56.910
Both said it mentally.

00:14:56.910 --> 00:15:04.280
So first of all we're gonna do is we're gonna do model and And if you don't set view,

00:15:04.280 --> 00:15:07.550
name There we go and you hear weaken dio view.

00:15:07.550 --> 00:15:09.250
There we go.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:10.290
So that is our view name.

00:15:10.290 --> 00:15:15.200
Then we can also do model and model and view.

00:15:15.200 --> 00:15:16.350
Don't set,

00:15:16.350 --> 00:15:19.450
Don't add object.

00:15:19.450 --> 00:15:20.890
Um,

00:15:20.890 --> 00:15:22.380
there we go.

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:23.740
And if you were going to attribute,

00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:24.220
name,

00:15:24.220 --> 00:15:25.280
message,

00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:27.140
attribute value.

00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:27.740
Hello,

00:15:27.740 --> 00:15:28.250
world.

00:15:28.250 --> 00:15:29.260
Okay.

00:15:29.260 --> 00:15:30.000
And then there we go.

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:33.440
And now let's do another object was gonna be message you want,

00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:33.890
I think,

00:15:33.890 --> 00:15:35.950
and we're going to do.

00:15:35.950 --> 00:15:38.780
Hello Skies.

00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:39.000
Well,

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:39.750
there we go.

00:15:39.750 --> 00:15:40.610
All right.

00:15:40.610 --> 00:15:46.600
And now we can just return model and view our model in view object that we've created here

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:46.600
.

00:15:46.600 --> 00:15:51.250
And it should inside our view that jsp um first of all,

00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:54.530
it should know that we're going to are viewed our jsp file since you have a view here.

00:15:54.530 --> 00:15:56.620
And then it adds in the Js speech.

00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:58.820
Since we configure this internal resource,

00:15:58.820 --> 00:15:59.600
we resolve our here,

00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:02.620
it'll add in the JCB Suffolk's JCB,

00:16:02.620 --> 00:16:05.080
Suffolk's and then the Web in prefix as well.

00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:11.610
And then inside our view that jsp file it will actually give us our it.

00:16:11.610 --> 00:16:16.410
It will take our message attributes that our message one attribute as well and display them

00:16:16.410 --> 00:16:17.260
in our browser.

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:36.750
So it's gonna run this save and any day now we should see There we go Server startup in

00:16:36.750 --> 00:16:39.050
66,536 milliseconds.

00:16:39.050 --> 00:16:40.510
So now let's go ahead.

00:16:40.510 --> 00:16:41.060
And,

00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:41.990
um,

00:16:41.990 --> 00:16:44.920
running in our browsers was gonna your browser.

00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:47.330
There we go.

00:16:47.330 --> 00:16:49.670
And let's restart this refresh.

00:16:49.670 --> 00:16:50.110
There we go.

00:16:50.110 --> 00:16:51.390
So message equals hello,

00:16:51.390 --> 00:16:53.460
World message One equals Hello,

00:16:53.460 --> 00:16:53.860
sky.

00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:54.620
Okay,

00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.500
so pretty simple stuff.

00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:58.500
It's going Take a look at how exactly we access that in Jsp.

00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:01.260
Just a detailed slide that I put it The end For some reason.

00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:01.880
Yes.

00:17:01.880 --> 00:17:05.680
You can maybe see how probably would have been a better idea to put the beginning since we

00:17:05.680 --> 00:17:06.730
already really went over it.

00:17:06.730 --> 00:17:10.430
But all the data we placed within these models is used by a view in general,

00:17:10.430 --> 00:17:12.430
a temple interview to render the Web page.

00:17:12.430 --> 00:17:17.890
We can then access these variables using dollar sign brackets,

00:17:17.890 --> 00:17:18.930
curly brackets,

00:17:18.930 --> 00:17:20.370
actually Butte name as seen here.

00:17:20.370 --> 00:17:21.590
So here we have our JSP file.

00:17:21.590 --> 00:17:22.630
And then is that r p?

00:17:22.630 --> 00:17:25.830
We have message equals dollar sign message.

00:17:25.830 --> 00:17:28.850
So if you go back to our code here,

00:17:28.850 --> 00:17:30.670
our reviewer,

00:17:30.670 --> 00:17:31.150
J speed,

00:17:31.150 --> 00:17:34.270
you'll see here how we have message equals dollar sign message.

00:17:34.270 --> 00:17:40.330
And this right here is a key which we set here when we created our model.

00:17:40.330 --> 00:17:42.730
So when we add an object message,

00:17:42.730 --> 00:17:45.280
we have a key message with a value holot world.

00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.890
So it'll look for an object with the key message and then return us a value of hello world

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:50.890
.

00:17:50.890 --> 00:17:51.850
So pretty simple stuff.

00:17:51.850 --> 00:17:53.460
Okay,

00:17:53.460 --> 00:17:55.740
So that essentially how we work with the model now,

00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:57.130
the models actually pretty important,

00:17:57.130 --> 00:18:02.520
because it really is a little bit of easier and better way to pass in variables most like

00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:03.750
you're gonna be using model and view,

00:18:03.750 --> 00:18:05.900
but you may be using model or model mapas.

00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:06.280
Well,

00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:08.210
that said,

00:18:08.210 --> 00:18:08.740
uh,

00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.100
we can also pass it using the request.

00:18:11.100 --> 00:18:12.820
We can pass it using a session.

00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:13.760
Uh,

00:18:13.760 --> 00:18:15.060
let's see what else?

00:18:15.060 --> 00:18:15.980
How often we pass it.

00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:17.320
Uh,

00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:21.720
I guess we could also pass it using a I think I know there are.

00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:23.150
There are a couple other myths,

00:18:23.150 --> 00:18:25.200
but I mean to execute them,

00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.910
it will be a post body.

00:18:26.910 --> 00:18:28.290
There's actually a lot of different ways to do it,

00:18:28.290 --> 00:18:28.930
but later,

00:18:28.930 --> 00:18:29.490
the main way,

00:18:29.490 --> 00:18:33.020
so essentially could do it through a section request or through model,

00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.150
But just we can just go to do with their model,

00:18:35.150 --> 00:18:35.460
since it,

00:18:35.460 --> 00:18:35.790
you know,

00:18:35.790 --> 00:18:37.910
sort of makes things easier.

00:18:37.910 --> 00:18:38.450
Essentially.

00:18:38.450 --> 00:18:39.230
So,

00:18:39.230 --> 00:18:39.850
without further ado,

00:18:39.850 --> 00:18:41.160
then let's send some homework.

00:18:41.160 --> 00:18:42.440
All right,

00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.070
So homework session,

00:18:43.070 --> 00:18:47.140
pretty simple on your job is to just create application that will pass a string in tow of

00:18:47.140 --> 00:18:47.480
you,

00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:51.380
and then we'll out boat that string in the view so you can use model and view,

00:18:51.380 --> 00:18:54.260
or you can use a model map or you can use model whatever you want.

00:18:54.260 --> 00:18:55.570
Just choose one.

00:18:55.570 --> 00:18:58.090
You could do all three if you want to create three different controllers,

00:18:58.090 --> 00:18:58.780
but,

00:18:58.780 --> 00:18:59.220
uh,

00:18:59.220 --> 00:18:59.600
yeah.

00:18:59.600 --> 00:19:01.350
Anyway,

00:19:01.350 --> 00:19:01.840
um,

00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:02.760
without further ado,

00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:04.170
I wish you luck.

00:19:04.170 --> 00:19:04.640
And,

00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:04.950
uh,

00:19:04.950 --> 00:19:06.050
also next time
