00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.720
Hello there.

00:00:00.720 --> 00:00:02.300
And welcome back to this spring development,

00:00:02.300 --> 00:00:02.810
Of course.

00:00:02.810 --> 00:00:08.060
So last time we went over using different request methods.

00:00:08.060 --> 00:00:10.080
Don't have accomplished different things.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:18.890
You in the same exact rest endpoint and us of hope to do dump was to create a,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.290
um,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.430
controller rest controller,

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:22.340
which would,

00:00:22.340 --> 00:00:22.690
you know,

00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:24.590
have the value students as always,

00:00:24.590 --> 00:00:26.550
but then use the request method put.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:27.760
Okay.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.000
And then,

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:29.630
um,

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:30.350
you know,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:36.770
it would put a value into the array list that we've created as our temporary data structure

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:36.770
.

00:00:36.770 --> 00:00:41.240
So here's essentially something on the lines of what you should have done.

00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:47.810
So I have a put student method here which takes in an integer a class I d as input.

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:52.410
So two inputs into the class I d request parameter and string student name request

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:53.250
parameter as well.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:55.210
Then it goes ahead.

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.140
And if class I d is more than students dot size minus one.

00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.350
So this is to ah,

00:01:01.350 --> 00:01:05.540
since jealous earth counting from zero it actually,

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:06.640
we have the minus one here.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:10.530
And so if class I D is more than the size of theory list,

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:14.550
then we go ahead and add a new era array list and attitude there.

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.420
And then add that array list to,

00:01:16.420 --> 00:01:19.840
um if it's not more than student loan size minus one,

00:01:19.840 --> 00:01:23.250
then we do students like get class I d Don't add Houston name since the class already

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:23.790
exists.

00:01:23.790 --> 00:01:25.070
And then just add this to it name,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:25.200
too,

00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.650
and the reprint students just to verify that it's working.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:32.850
So let's go ahead and run this on the server to test cell.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.930
Alright,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:35.370
Any day now.

00:01:35.370 --> 00:01:37.910
There we go.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:40.390
So I start up 2.6 seconds.

00:01:40.390 --> 00:01:42.850
Let's now go to postman.

00:01:42.850 --> 00:01:45.370
Close this.

00:01:45.370 --> 00:01:45.870
OK?

00:01:45.870 --> 00:01:47.120
And now we're gonna we have Okay,

00:01:47.120 --> 00:01:47.410
so,

00:01:47.410 --> 00:01:47.840
first of all,

00:01:47.840 --> 00:01:49.430
we have the put method here.

00:01:49.430 --> 00:01:50.550
Makes full screen.

00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:51.970
Okay,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:53.290
so we have a put method here,

00:01:53.290 --> 00:01:53.730
right?

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:59.360
Um and then we have local host 80 80 Web artifact students Class I d to his parameters

00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:02.780
Class I d to student name Sasha.

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:03.170
Okay,

00:02:03.170 --> 00:02:03.800
Makes sense.

00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:05.810
So let's go and send this response.

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:10.860
Send this a request and we actually not found.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.650
What's the problem?

00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.540
Ah,

00:02:12.540 --> 00:02:15.840
Web artifact slash students Class I d.

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:17.060
Let me take a look at what they get.

00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:19.850
Problem is an eclipse.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.720
No.

00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.670
Having found first view with Web artifact students in displeasure.

00:02:24.670 --> 00:02:25.350
Serval it,

00:02:25.350 --> 00:02:27.240
um,

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.850
did it not?

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:29.720
Oh,

00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:30.120
some reason,

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:30.340
actually,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:33.920
didn't map any of the any of the,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:34.480
um,

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.750
mapping swimming makes it it saved.

00:02:37.750 --> 00:02:39.370
And now let's run it.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:46.460
All right.

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:46.660
Well,

00:02:46.660 --> 00:02:47.000
I mean,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.510
he still doesn't map it.

00:02:48.510 --> 00:02:52.690
Let me go and actually try to do a maven clean here and then Aldi running,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:54.110
and it should be working fine.

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:55.850
Right there.

00:02:55.850 --> 00:02:57.810
You So after,

00:02:57.810 --> 00:02:58.440
um,

00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.470
doing amazing clean,

00:03:00.470 --> 00:03:02.120
then reinstalling clips,

00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:03.490
not reinstalling,

00:03:03.490 --> 00:03:04.400
restarting eclipse.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.850
And then also creating a new server.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:08.100
It now works.

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:09.610
So that's sort of the magic of spring,

00:03:09.610 --> 00:03:11.960
NBC or in spring in general.

00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:15.720
Sometimes it just decides to not look for your controllers.

00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.440
So,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:16.640
you know,

00:03:16.640 --> 00:03:17.090
you just gotta,

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:17.370
you know,

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.570
research a little bit,

00:03:18.570 --> 00:03:20.980
maybe clear the amendment maven dependencies.

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:21.840
Put them back in.

00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:22.670
Um,

00:03:22.670 --> 00:03:24.280
sometimes it may happen.

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:24.750
Usually,

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:25.040
though,

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:25.540
it doesn't.

00:03:25.540 --> 00:03:26.740
It's pretty rare,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.920
but spring is known for sometimes doing that.

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.750
That's actually another thing that spring boots sort of fixes.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:34.920
But that said,

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:36.700
just if it does happen,

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:36.890
just,

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:37.110
you know,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:39.630
made unclean Open eclipse,

00:03:39.630 --> 00:03:42.040
new server and everything will be everything the same.

00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:42.280
Actually,

00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.610
if you take a look So I changed nothing in the code,

00:03:44.610 --> 00:03:47.460
and yet it's still now,

00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:47.950
you know,

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:50.100
works when done it.

00:03:50.100 --> 00:03:50.870
Anyway,

00:03:50.870 --> 00:03:51.790
let's get to the lesson.

00:03:51.790 --> 00:03:54.150
So that's gonna go to our postman?

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:56.310
They're ago.

00:03:56.310 --> 00:03:57.370
And now,

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:58.540
first of all we need to do in it,

00:03:58.540 --> 00:03:59.050
I totally forgot.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.450
What you doing in it?

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:01.750
Local host,

00:04:01.750 --> 00:04:09.300
Local host 80 80 slash web artifact slash In it.

00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.370
There we go.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:13.150
So it initialized the,

00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.120
um,

00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:16.150
our A list.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:17.490
All right.

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:19.740
And then now we can put it into here.

00:04:19.740 --> 00:04:20.460
So class I,

00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:24.670
d to student named Sasha is gonna add to the third.

00:04:24.670 --> 00:04:25.760
Um,

00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:29.220
this is gonna add a student named Sasha to the third array list.

00:04:29.220 --> 00:04:29.740
Remember?

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.630
That's because computers are coming from zero,

00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:34.070
so choose into 3rd 1 and not the 2nd 1 Okay,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:35.180
so it send it.

00:04:35.180 --> 00:04:37.430
Okay.

00:04:37.430 --> 00:04:37.780
And now,

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:38.480
in eclipse,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:42.580
you'll see we have our first derail iStar second or a list in Arthur's Lear.

00:04:42.580 --> 00:04:43.400
A list at the end.

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:44.530
Here we have,

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:45.400
Sasha.

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.130
There we go.

00:04:46.130 --> 00:04:48.190
And so now when we do a,

00:04:48.190 --> 00:04:50.560
um All right,

00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:52.740
so for your students post Really it that Yeah.

00:04:52.740 --> 00:04:53.650
So now,

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:54.200
um,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:56.090
when we do Ah,

00:04:56.090 --> 00:04:57.070
well,

00:04:57.070 --> 00:04:57.500
I mean,

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.090
we probably won't be able to do that,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:00.310
um,

00:05:00.310 --> 00:05:02.780
dog.

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:03.170
I see.

00:05:03.170 --> 00:05:04.820
Let's go to postmen.

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:07.580
And now we can do a post method here,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.600
too.

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:13.410
And this class I d will be to remove this.

00:05:13.410 --> 00:05:16.300
And now if we send it there we go.

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.230
So we get Yes.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:17.520
See,

00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:17.990
Yvette,

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.120
Calvin and soil.

00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:19.960
Er All right,

00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.520
There we go.

00:05:21.520 --> 00:05:21.760
OK,

00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:22.200
so in this case,

00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.250
we actually get,

00:05:23.250 --> 00:05:23.880
um,

00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.670
or actually know what's what seems to be okay.

00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:27.960
I see.

00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:28.300
I see.

00:05:28.300 --> 00:05:32.210
We have to do three here in order to get there we go.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.210
And I think it's here at the end there,

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.660
Sasha.

00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:35.440
So that's actually what we added just now,

00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:38.620
when we used the put method so that essentially,

00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:39.150
what should have done.

00:05:39.150 --> 00:05:39.810
So this essentially,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.630
how we can use different request methods have accomplished different things.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:46.350
And that's something that standard in,

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:46.910
um,

00:05:46.910 --> 00:05:50.990
most ap eyes sort of something they could do.

00:05:50.990 --> 00:05:52.030
But anyway,

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:52.590
without further ado,

00:05:52.590 --> 00:05:52.830
then,

00:05:52.830 --> 00:05:53.550
um,

00:05:53.550 --> 00:05:55.230
let's get interested.

00:05:55.230 --> 00:05:55.580
Listen.

00:05:55.580 --> 00:05:56.630
All right,

00:05:56.630 --> 00:06:00.430
So they never gonna be going over logging in spring and long.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.650
Actually,

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:01.230
pretty important,

00:06:01.230 --> 00:06:02.330
as we'll see in a second here,

00:06:02.330 --> 00:06:07.850
it allows us to perform better debugging and of our application.

00:06:07.850 --> 00:06:14.940
It also allows for on top of the body and allows for sort of keeping the status of off of

00:06:14.940 --> 00:06:15.950
our application.

00:06:15.950 --> 00:06:16.780
Um,

00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:17.350
you know,

00:06:17.350 --> 00:06:21.480
in check so we can have you no longer that will then log,

00:06:21.480 --> 00:06:21.790
you know,

00:06:21.790 --> 00:06:26.440
every single time somebody's logs in or log every single time that somebody tries to break

00:06:26.440 --> 00:06:27.990
in to our application.

00:06:27.990 --> 00:06:30.750
We've written a super awesome banking app,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:31.960
and whenever somebody tries to,

00:06:31.960 --> 00:06:32.310
you know,

00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:35.230
do extreme hacking on us,

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:36.700
it's send it,

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:40.530
send us an email and text message and then a,

00:06:40.530 --> 00:06:40.940
uh,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:41.640
what else?

00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:42.280
Well,

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:44.640
it also send us a Skype message,

00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:44.830
you know,

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:45.450
slack.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.390
Everything that's possible if it'll even fax us that somebody's trying to hack us and so we

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:51.480
can get on it right away.

00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:52.090
So,

00:06:52.090 --> 00:06:52.300
yeah,

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:54.760
that's what loud logging allows us to do.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:59.900
And it sort of allows us to do it in a in a more organized sense.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:00.610
OK,

00:07:00.610 --> 00:07:04.670
so before when we did do some kind of debugging or something so actually that we have a

00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:06.300
program that,

00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:06.760
you know,

00:07:06.760 --> 00:07:07.070
I don't know,

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.780
a sorting program will try and develop a new sorting algorithm.

00:07:09.780 --> 00:07:14.090
What we would do if you were do system dot outdoor print Ln every single time.

00:07:14.090 --> 00:07:14.260
You know,

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:15.120
at each iteration,

00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.280
if he wanted to check,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.720
you know how something is actually working in.

00:07:18.720 --> 00:07:19.650
We would print it.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.110
So here,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:25.860
longing essentially just sort of allows us to instead of doing that kind of,

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:26.850
you know,

00:07:26.850 --> 00:07:31.520
not do that instead of you doing just amount for Len will just use,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:32.140
um,

00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:33.690
log and then,

00:07:33.690 --> 00:07:33.930
you know,

00:07:33.930 --> 00:07:34.450
print it.

00:07:34.450 --> 00:07:38.960
And then and then our logging library will then handle everything else.

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:39.210
So well,

00:07:39.210 --> 00:07:39.540
you know,

00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:41.920
if we have it set to email,

00:07:41.920 --> 00:07:44.100
it will send us to a Team 10 email.

00:07:44.100 --> 00:07:45.020
If we on top of that,

00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.380
have it sent to email and then Consul as well,

00:07:47.380 --> 00:07:49.750
it will send it to the email and then also the consul.

00:07:49.750 --> 00:07:51.370
If we haven't set to,

00:07:51.370 --> 00:07:52.010
you know,

00:07:52.010 --> 00:07:54.280
email Consul,

00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:55.160
and then ah,

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.210
file as well,

00:07:56.210 --> 00:07:57.090
Somewhere on the computer,

00:07:57.090 --> 00:07:58.060
it will do that as well.

00:07:58.060 --> 00:07:59.330
And so they're unlimited,

00:07:59.330 --> 00:08:00.170
sort of.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:00.940
I mean,

00:08:00.940 --> 00:08:02.010
I get there are limited,

00:08:02.010 --> 00:08:08.310
but it's just for the sake of contact there unlimited possibilities to how we can log the

00:08:08.310 --> 00:08:10.050
status of our application.

00:08:10.050 --> 00:08:13.650
So let's go actually take a look at a very basic longing example.

00:08:13.650 --> 00:08:16.180
The long is very important for professional app.

00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:19.880
Development allows us to send information about our application to one specific location

00:08:19.880 --> 00:08:21.800
which allows for nobody and performance in front.

00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:24.020
So when I see here one specific location,

00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:25.120
I don't really mean that.

00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:27.980
It allows it to be sent to one specific location.

00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:32.160
It could be two or three or four or 50 if we really wanted to.

00:08:32.160 --> 00:08:32.690
But,

00:08:32.690 --> 00:08:33.150
um,

00:08:33.150 --> 00:08:33.720
yeah,

00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:36.010
generally one or more specific locations,

00:08:36.010 --> 00:08:38.270
So logging in spring is handle internally.

00:08:38.270 --> 00:08:40.390
So when we actually do start up,

00:08:40.390 --> 00:08:44.220
you actually do get sort of like a spring some spring,

00:08:44.220 --> 00:08:48.200
some spring outputs in the console.

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:48.320
So,

00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:48.490
like,

00:08:48.490 --> 00:08:48.900
for example,

00:08:48.900 --> 00:08:51.530
when it finds the controller controllers,

00:08:51.530 --> 00:08:52.170
it sort of does it.

00:08:52.170 --> 00:08:54.040
And it doesn't little bit through Tomcat,

00:08:54.040 --> 00:08:54.770
But essentially,

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.150
it's essentially spring.

00:08:56.150 --> 00:08:56.830
Um,

00:08:56.830 --> 00:08:58.970
in this course we will use Ah,

00:08:58.970 --> 00:09:03.280
but we can override it so that we can specify our own log settings.

00:09:03.280 --> 00:09:04.270
In this course,

00:09:04.270 --> 00:09:06.870
we will use luck for J for the application.

00:09:06.870 --> 00:09:10.210
Let's add the dependency to our palms or XML file.

00:09:10.210 --> 00:09:12.370
So look for Jay is you know,

00:09:12.370 --> 00:09:13.120
it's a pretty popular,

00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.900
like popular library for,

00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:15.650
um,

00:09:15.650 --> 00:09:17.430
logging.

00:09:17.430 --> 00:09:20.690
What also pretty partner there is log back It's also another application,

00:09:20.690 --> 00:09:21.220
but,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:21.510
uh,

00:09:21.510 --> 00:09:21.850
yeah.

00:09:21.850 --> 00:09:22.590
Okay.

00:09:22.590 --> 00:09:26.570
So look for J dependency group I D lock or J artifact.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:29.150
I d look for J a version 1.2 points.

00:09:29.150 --> 00:09:29.810
17.

00:09:29.810 --> 00:09:35.260
It will go ahead and download that dependency to our computer.

00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:36.570
Let's go ahead and Ah,

00:09:36.570 --> 00:09:37.650
do that.

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:39.340
Okay,

00:09:39.340 --> 00:09:40.010
so here we are.

00:09:40.010 --> 00:09:41.430
Let's go out and go to our,

00:09:41.430 --> 00:09:42.650
um,

00:09:42.650 --> 00:09:45.060
palmed our XML file.

00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.870
All right.

00:09:46.870 --> 00:09:48.420
Okay.

00:09:48.420 --> 00:09:51.120
And let's go on a copy in this application,

00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:55.520
so f and then command s all right.

00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:56.060
And there we go,

00:09:56.060 --> 00:09:56.990
So it's no installed.

00:09:56.990 --> 00:09:57.590
And after,

00:09:57.590 --> 00:10:00.350
if this just take a little bit longer on your laptop,

00:10:00.350 --> 00:10:02.280
our computer,

00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:02.600
whatever.

00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:03.050
Using,

00:10:03.050 --> 00:10:03.700
um,

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:05.850
you're probably not doing us this this on a phone.

00:10:05.850 --> 00:10:07.060
You're definitely doing this on the phone.

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:07.350
But,

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:07.840
you know,

00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:09.630
if it does take a little bit longer,

00:10:09.630 --> 00:10:10.280
um,

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.880
that's just because you don't have installed.

00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:13.060
So the way maven works,

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:13.890
um,

00:10:13.890 --> 00:10:16.850
is that installs whatever dependency you need,

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:19.070
And then if you remove it,

00:10:19.070 --> 00:10:21.040
then it actually doesn't remove it from your system.

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.790
It just removes it from the projects,

00:10:22.790 --> 00:10:24.540
would essentially just removed the link to it.

00:10:24.540 --> 00:10:25.450
Um,

00:10:25.450 --> 00:10:27.470
but if you put it back and actually read,

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:28.790
downloaded it just links to it again.

00:10:28.790 --> 00:10:30.890
So it doesn't have to read.

00:10:30.890 --> 00:10:31.380
Downloaded.

00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:32.800
So yeah,

00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.950
that's just one thing that we can we can do.

00:10:34.950 --> 00:10:35.730
Okay,

00:10:35.730 --> 00:10:37.940
so now that we've added,

00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:38.350
ah,

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.290
log for Jay,

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:44.310
let's take a look at how we can actually utilize it to work in our application.

00:10:44.310 --> 00:10:45.480
Okay?

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:51.620
So in order to configure our longing log in application or just our log Earth,

00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.710
it's called a longer We need to create a log four j dot properties.

00:10:55.710 --> 00:11:01.450
So a properties file is put as a file specifically designed for storing data.

00:11:01.450 --> 00:11:03.880
Kind of like XML or Jason we can create.

00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:05.900
Except it's not really like that.

00:11:05.900 --> 00:11:06.060
But,

00:11:06.060 --> 00:11:06.310
you know,

00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:08.080
for the sake of context again,

00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:09.080
let's just pretend that it is.

00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:14.080
We can create a look for Jr Properties file under eight slash resource is folder and look

00:11:14.080 --> 00:11:16.950
for Jay will find it and get the settings from there as such.

00:11:16.950 --> 00:11:17.890
So,

00:11:17.890 --> 00:11:18.590
um,

00:11:18.590 --> 00:11:20.500
here's an example that I just sort of,

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:20.750
you know,

00:11:20.750 --> 00:11:22.180
typed up really quickly.

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.220
Um,

00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:25.590
here we have a root logger option.

00:11:25.590 --> 00:11:31.240
So we have looked for J dot Rood locker route longer equals debug.

00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:34.720
STD out and file as Well,

00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.620
so what debug means is that essentially,

00:11:37.620 --> 00:11:41.190
it's the longing level that we're going to use on.

00:11:41.190 --> 00:11:42.720
And there are a couple of different logging levels,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:45.160
so you'll see what exactly Those are in a second here.

00:11:45.160 --> 00:11:45.920
I'll explain it.

00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:46.980
Um,

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.650
essentially,

00:11:47.650 --> 00:11:48.430
it just means that,

00:11:48.430 --> 00:11:48.850
you know,

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:52.000
instead of having let's just say that we want to,

00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:52.280
you know,

00:11:52.280 --> 00:11:54.550
no performance info of our server,

00:11:54.550 --> 00:11:56.440
we would,

00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:56.910
you know,

00:11:56.910 --> 00:11:57.200
put,

00:11:57.200 --> 00:11:57.450
you know,

00:11:57.450 --> 00:11:58.580
we want to know performance,

00:11:58.580 --> 00:11:58.930
right?

00:11:58.930 --> 00:12:01.510
And so our server will constantly send us performance.

00:12:01.510 --> 00:12:02.010
But then,

00:12:02.010 --> 00:12:02.480
after that,

00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:02.660
you know,

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:03.180
we were We were,

00:12:03.180 --> 00:12:03.390
you know,

00:12:03.390 --> 00:12:04.020
our performance.

00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:05.440
We don't want to see any more,

00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:06.290
and it takes up.

00:12:06.290 --> 00:12:06.480
Just,

00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:06.660
you know,

00:12:06.660 --> 00:12:12.170
too much space in the consul or files or wherever we send that longing to.

00:12:12.170 --> 00:12:13.370
And so,

00:12:13.370 --> 00:12:14.990
in result,

00:12:14.990 --> 00:12:16.590
um,

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:18.900
we actually said it,

00:12:18.900 --> 00:12:19.390
you know,

00:12:19.390 --> 00:12:20.480
we don't want performance,

00:12:20.480 --> 00:12:21.680
and we just want to know,

00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.050
you know,

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:23.930
just general server info.

00:12:23.930 --> 00:12:26.810
Or we could say that we don't We don't even want to know server info.

00:12:26.810 --> 00:12:28.680
We just want to know error.

00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:30.460
So if there's an error than send it to us,

00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:31.610
we don't want to know anything else.

00:12:31.610 --> 00:12:32.060
Sort of,

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:35.060
um said Essentially different levels.

00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:35.450
Okay,

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:37.460
so STD out is after just the consul's.

00:12:37.460 --> 00:12:39.700
It just means that we're going to send it out to the consul,

00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:41.770
and they're also gonna send it out to a files.

00:12:41.770 --> 00:12:42.910
This is just two options.

00:12:42.910 --> 00:12:43.610
We could also have,

00:12:43.610 --> 00:12:43.990
you know,

00:12:43.990 --> 00:12:45.040
a lot of different stuff here.

00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:46.290
We could have email,

00:12:46.290 --> 00:12:46.920
you know,

00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:50.190
maybe some other more complex stuff,

00:12:50.190 --> 00:12:52.710
but this little serverless sort of the standards.

00:12:52.710 --> 00:12:53.950
So,

00:12:53.950 --> 00:12:54.380
Rita,

00:12:54.380 --> 00:12:57.190
So this is right Here is where we're going to configure.

00:12:57.190 --> 00:12:57.940
STD out.

00:12:57.940 --> 00:13:01.050
So log for j dot a pender dot STD out,

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.120
um,

00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:04.470
just redirect messages to the consul.

00:13:04.470 --> 00:13:04.800
Still,

00:13:04.800 --> 00:13:05.870
um,

00:13:05.870 --> 00:13:06.720
first of all,

00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:07.980
we assigned the class,

00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:08.440
so,

00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:08.950
uh,

00:13:08.950 --> 00:13:13.300
STD out is or Apache lock for J consul adapter.

00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:13.600
Okay.

00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.380
So just adapts What are longer files to the consulate,

00:13:16.380 --> 00:13:19.120
then the target is system dot out.

00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:20.530
So system doubt Dr.

00:13:20.530 --> 00:13:22.180
Interline system that don't make sense.

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:26.870
And then the layups layout is actually where we're going to How what what layout were

00:13:26.870 --> 00:13:30.530
actually going to sort of send to our,

00:13:30.530 --> 00:13:34.090
um um consul in this case,

00:13:34.090 --> 00:13:35.680
we put up Pattern Lee out here,

00:13:35.680 --> 00:13:38.390
which is just again a built in class of Ah,

00:13:38.390 --> 00:13:40.110
long for J um,

00:13:40.110 --> 00:13:40.880
pattern layout,

00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:42.850
which allows us to define a powder and pattern.

00:13:42.850 --> 00:13:46.040
And then we set the conversion pattern to,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:47.150
um,

00:13:47.150 --> 00:13:50.180
percent de y y so year,

00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:50.790
month,

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:51.590
day,

00:13:51.590 --> 00:13:54.000
and then our minutes second,

00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.750
and then we put the conversion,

00:13:58.750 --> 00:13:59.860
Specify IRS here.

00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:01.720
So there are quite a bit of conversions,

00:14:01.720 --> 00:14:03.790
festive fires when I'm not gonna go over all of them.

00:14:03.790 --> 00:14:08.390
But let's take a look at a really quick overview of exactly what they do.

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.590
All right?

00:14:09.590 --> 00:14:10.280
Sure we are.

00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:15.740
This is actually the pattern layout documentation as of defined by Apache,

00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:16.800
um,

00:14:16.800 --> 00:14:18.240
which actually made look for J,

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:18.780
by the way,

00:14:18.780 --> 00:14:20.380
Um And so,

00:14:20.380 --> 00:14:20.670
um,

00:14:20.670 --> 00:14:24.380
here it just gives us a bunch of different info about conversion.

00:14:24.380 --> 00:14:25.010
Carrot character.

00:14:25.010 --> 00:14:27.000
So they all start with a percent sign.

00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.150
Um,

00:14:28.150 --> 00:14:30.350
okay.

00:14:30.350 --> 00:14:30.770
And then,

00:14:30.770 --> 00:14:35.310
as you can see here on our followed by optional format modifiers and a conversion care in

00:14:35.310 --> 00:14:35.800
this case,

00:14:35.800 --> 00:14:36.580
um,

00:14:36.580 --> 00:14:41.620
the percent sign is just the me that it's a converted character and in this ah,

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:42.850
dash is a modifier.

00:14:42.850 --> 00:14:47.040
And then the five p is actually the actual convert character.

00:14:47.040 --> 00:14:52.870
So conversion character R C five is actually modifier as well see used to output the

00:14:52.870 --> 00:14:54.290
category of the long event,

00:14:54.290 --> 00:14:58.950
the category conversion for a specific conversion.

00:14:58.950 --> 00:15:00.010
Specify,

00:15:00.010 --> 00:15:06.680
or can we auction optionally followed by a precision that is a decimal constant in brackets

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:06.680
.

00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:08.090
Okay,

00:15:08.090 --> 00:15:08.940
So long event,

00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:09.250
essentially,

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:13.990
just the invent that called the log itself that made us want to log something.

00:15:13.990 --> 00:15:14.420
Sort of,

00:15:14.420 --> 00:15:15.980
um and so that essentially,

00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:17.590
just did their different categories of it.

00:15:17.590 --> 00:15:18.910
I'm not gonna go too far into this,

00:15:18.910 --> 00:15:19.660
but essentially,

00:15:19.660 --> 00:15:21.490
just give us the category C.

00:15:21.490 --> 00:15:24.070
And so you're going to take a look at this if you want.

00:15:24.070 --> 00:15:24.590
I mean,

00:15:24.590 --> 00:15:28.190
if going over all of this will take probably at least,

00:15:28.190 --> 00:15:28.500
like,

00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:30.000
40 minutes or something like that,

00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:30.740
if not more,

00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:31.450
probably more.

00:15:31.450 --> 00:15:32.250
But yes,

00:15:32.250 --> 00:15:33.310
there is a lot of different things.

00:15:33.310 --> 00:15:33.990
Most notably,

00:15:33.990 --> 00:15:35.260
they're gonna be D right here.

00:15:35.260 --> 00:15:37.280
This stop a day of the long event.

00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:38.240
Um,

00:15:38.240 --> 00:15:42.280
and then also what's really well,

00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:42.680
I mean,

00:15:42.680 --> 00:15:43.370
cool.

00:15:43.370 --> 00:15:46.410
We can use a file of the logging request,

00:15:46.410 --> 00:15:48.650
but this doesn't always work to reliably.

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:51.070
And finally,

00:15:51.070 --> 00:15:57.950
what is the prequel is we can we can help with the method name that's using the capital M.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.010
Ah.

00:15:59.010 --> 00:15:59.430
And there we go.

00:15:59.430 --> 00:16:00.250
We also have peace,

00:16:00.250 --> 00:16:02.500
the priority of the logging of the event as well.

00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:04.500
That's also pretty pretty important.

00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:05.320
Yes.

00:16:05.320 --> 00:16:05.390
So,

00:16:05.390 --> 00:16:05.610
again,

00:16:05.610 --> 00:16:07.040
you can read all over all of these.

00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.540
If you really want to go toe to search class pattern layout and it'll give you this file

00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:18.140
and you could take a look at all the information that is sort of comes along with this,

00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:18.480
but yeah,

00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:18.780
generally,

00:16:18.780 --> 00:16:20.240
it's not important to know all of it,

00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:26.080
but just keep it handy because you never really know when you might need to do some extreme

00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:27.450
longer configuration.

00:16:27.450 --> 00:16:28.720
Okay,

00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:29.310
so anyway,

00:16:29.310 --> 00:16:31.980
let's go take a look at the power point again,

00:16:31.980 --> 00:16:34.050
just to get an idea of exactly what is happening there.

00:16:34.050 --> 00:16:35.330
Okay,

00:16:35.330 --> 00:16:35.900
so here we are.

00:16:35.900 --> 00:16:36.420
So,

00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:37.090
um,

00:16:37.090 --> 00:16:38.830
right here we have conversion pattern,

00:16:38.830 --> 00:16:39.610
percent decent.

00:16:39.610 --> 00:16:40.520
That's date.

00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:41.640
Then we have year,

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:42.040
month,

00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:42.490
date,

00:16:42.490 --> 00:16:42.860
hours,

00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:43.120
minutes.

00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:44.330
Seconds is just a date.

00:16:44.330 --> 00:16:45.610
Standard date.

00:16:45.610 --> 00:16:47.030
Then we have percent.

00:16:47.030 --> 00:16:48.170
Five pieces.

00:16:48.170 --> 00:16:49.140
The priority.

00:16:49.140 --> 00:16:49.870
Um,

00:16:49.870 --> 00:16:50.530
this is five.

00:16:50.530 --> 00:16:51.730
I believe it's debug.

00:16:51.730 --> 00:16:52.560
Um,

00:16:52.560 --> 00:16:53.640
perhaps,

00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:54.520
perhaps not.

00:16:54.520 --> 00:16:55.250
I'm not Charlie.

00:16:55.250 --> 00:16:55.670
Sure.

00:16:55.670 --> 00:16:59.040
And then we have percent c percent l and someone.

00:16:59.040 --> 00:17:01.730
Someone so percent l is actually the,

00:17:01.730 --> 00:17:02.100
um,

00:17:02.100 --> 00:17:04.800
line number where was called,

00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:08.540
but you said again there I can go over all this is gonna take a very long time,

00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:13.180
but for our sake lets you know that's not because again,

00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:13.730
as I said,

00:17:13.730 --> 00:17:15.270
let's just stop the type of stuff.

00:17:15.270 --> 00:17:16.470
There's a lot of things to know,

00:17:16.470 --> 00:17:18.020
and it's not very so,

00:17:18.020 --> 00:17:20.590
so different so much that it's difficult to understand.

00:17:20.590 --> 00:17:22.280
That is just a long time to explain.

00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:23.100
There's a lot to go over.

00:17:23.100 --> 00:17:23.790
So yeah,

00:17:23.790 --> 00:17:24.500
again,

00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:25.990
if you really wanna know,

00:17:25.990 --> 00:17:28.000
becomes like a logging expert,

00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:30.970
spend like maximum two hours on it on,

00:17:30.970 --> 00:17:34.380
and I think you'll er you'll get everything to the max anyway,

00:17:34.380 --> 00:17:35.240
Um,

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:36.760
then this is a little more interesting.

00:17:36.760 --> 00:17:40.350
This just we configure our redirect to console.

00:17:40.350 --> 00:17:42.900
So here's where we redirect to a file.

00:17:42.900 --> 00:17:43.680
So,

00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:44.230
um,

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:45.760
so long for J.

00:17:45.760 --> 00:17:49.750
Pender File is or Apache lock for J rolling file adapter.

00:17:49.750 --> 00:17:52.250
So he was gonna output it to Tomcat home.

00:17:52.250 --> 00:17:53.690
So we're going to get this.

00:17:53.690 --> 00:17:55.220
We're gonna use Catalina home,

00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:58.390
which will look for Jay will actually read this,

00:17:58.390 --> 00:17:59.360
and they will see.

00:17:59.360 --> 00:17:59.640
Okay,

00:17:59.640 --> 00:18:02.610
we have a Catalina four catalina dot home modified here.

00:18:02.610 --> 00:18:04.580
Just put that path in,

00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:09.640
and then we do slash logs slash my app dot long and we will see you here in a second.

00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:10.760
What exactly this means.

00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:12.150
So maximum finals.

00:18:12.150 --> 00:18:14.240
I used to Maxim file size five megabytes.

00:18:14.240 --> 00:18:16.800
That is five million bytes.

00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:17.810
I think it's five million.

00:18:17.810 --> 00:18:19.450
Um,

00:18:19.450 --> 00:18:21.540
I'm not gonna counter right now,

00:18:21.540 --> 00:18:23.860
but I think it's five megabytes.

00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:24.220
What?

00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.000
We want to know the bites anyway.

00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.960
Then we also have Mac Max Backup Index Christie.

00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.640
Number of lines.

00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.550
It could be backed up.

00:18:31.550 --> 00:18:35.060
They were also have fire layout pattern layout.

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:37.580
And then we also just this year we just configure the layout as well.

00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:39.090
So just like we configure the layout here,

00:18:39.090 --> 00:18:40.650
we just same exact thing here.

00:18:40.650 --> 00:18:41.500
Some exact things.

00:18:41.500 --> 00:18:44.280
Stuff Pretty simple when I was going.

00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:44.540
Actually,

00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:48.000
take a look at how this will work when we run this in our code.

00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:48.940
All right,

00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.330
So one important thing that I might have maybe forgotten to mention is that we actually to

00:18:53.330 --> 00:18:57.290
put that file under our resource is folder,

00:18:57.290 --> 00:18:59.440
so that's gonna actually do it right now together,

00:18:59.440 --> 00:18:59.930
Um,

00:18:59.930 --> 00:19:03.050
we're going to go to Web artifact and are here in Java.

00:19:03.050 --> 00:19:05.000
Resource is under that.

00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:05.330
You know,

00:19:05.330 --> 00:19:08.150
we're going to SRC And here we have Maine and test.

00:19:08.150 --> 00:19:11.360
We're gonna create a new folder called Lips.

00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:11.600
Nope,

00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:11.880
nope.

00:19:11.880 --> 00:19:12.130
Nope,

00:19:12.130 --> 00:19:12.980
not a file.

00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:20.520
We're gonna create a folder called Resource is there we go.

00:19:20.520 --> 00:19:27.080
And inside resource is we're gonna create a new file called Log for J Dog properties,

00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:30.800
and everything has to be named the exact same or else it won't be able to find it.

00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:31.540
OK,

00:19:31.540 --> 00:19:33.100
now it's gonna paste in our code.

00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:35.480
There we go.

00:19:35.480 --> 00:19:36.690
If you know,

00:19:36.690 --> 00:19:38.580
if you don't want to carpet all this by hand,

00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:39.170
just go ahead.

00:19:39.170 --> 00:19:40.570
And I'm just look for online.

00:19:40.570 --> 00:19:44.600
So just basic lock for J configuration online,

00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:47.750
and then it it'll probably you've some like this or you could just,

00:19:47.750 --> 00:19:47.930
you know,

00:19:47.930 --> 00:19:48.530
do Consul,

00:19:48.530 --> 00:19:50.490
that's a little bit quicker.

00:19:50.490 --> 00:19:51.650
Okay,

00:19:51.650 --> 00:19:52.070
there we go.

00:19:52.070 --> 00:19:55.460
So especially just this allows us to perform a longer.

00:19:55.460 --> 00:19:57.040
We already went over what all of this does.

00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.690
Let's go ahead and actually run this now.

00:19:58.690 --> 00:20:05.120
And you said we should already start to see right here a little bit of a different logger.

00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.420
Whoops.

00:20:06.420 --> 00:20:06.690
Nope.

00:20:06.690 --> 00:20:08.290
We didn't We didn't start to see it.

00:20:08.290 --> 00:20:09.350
I'm gonna actually take a look.

00:20:09.350 --> 00:20:10.060
Why?

00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:11.170
Okay,

00:20:11.170 --> 00:20:11.540
there we go.

00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:12.080
That makes sense.

00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:14.760
So our resource is should actually be in Maine.

00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:15.700
Um,

00:20:15.700 --> 00:20:16.420
I don't wife.

00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:22.600
We write that I probably configure the logger at least 5000 times throughout my life.

00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:27.650
And I forgot that it's a resource is folder is supposed to be in Maine,

00:20:27.650 --> 00:20:29.690
which is actually not so much a logger.

00:20:29.690 --> 00:20:34.260
Specific thing at as it is maven directory structure,

00:20:34.260 --> 00:20:37.850
specific thing and the amount of maven projects I've created,

00:20:37.850 --> 00:20:40.370
we're probably in the tens of thousands,

00:20:40.370 --> 00:20:45.070
and so I can't believe I can't believe that actually forgot.

00:20:45.070 --> 00:20:45.620
Anyway,

00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.340
um,

00:20:46.340 --> 00:20:48.740
you never know when you're a brain stops working.

00:20:48.740 --> 00:20:52.120
So main resource is we have a main java.

00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.630
Now we have main Resource is Okay,

00:20:54.630 --> 00:20:55.430
um,

00:20:55.430 --> 00:20:57.970
so now we should go and be able going on and run this.

00:20:57.970 --> 00:21:00.980
And now we actually get different longing.

00:21:00.980 --> 00:21:02.820
They're ago.

00:21:02.820 --> 00:21:06.620
So you'll see now that we actually do get sort of different logging.

00:21:06.620 --> 00:21:08.450
So we still have the basic Tomcat Loggins,

00:21:08.450 --> 00:21:08.660
actually,

00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:09.640
just the server starting.

00:21:09.640 --> 00:21:11.320
But then when spring starts,

00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:13.210
it actually has its own logger,

00:21:13.210 --> 00:21:14.360
and it uses out No.

00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:14.770
Yeah,

00:21:14.770 --> 00:21:15.930
and uses our longer.

00:21:15.930 --> 00:21:17.030
So in this case,

00:21:17.030 --> 00:21:17.850
um,

00:21:17.850 --> 00:21:21.010
as we did with STD out,

00:21:21.010 --> 00:21:21.760
we have,

00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.310
um,

00:21:22.310 --> 00:21:23.630
first of all the time.

00:21:23.630 --> 00:21:26.980
So we get the time and then so are conversion patterns.

00:21:26.980 --> 00:21:29.030
But the date and time,

00:21:29.030 --> 00:21:31.030
Then we have the priority right here.

00:21:31.030 --> 00:21:31.710
Debug.

00:21:31.710 --> 00:21:33.820
Then we have the place where it's starting.

00:21:33.820 --> 00:21:37.690
So the class percent see um right here,

00:21:37.690 --> 00:21:38.520
dispatcher servant.

00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:44.200
Then we have the line 118 and then we have the actual message itself.

00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:47.800
Just Asian initializing dispatcher Servet Spring,

00:21:47.800 --> 00:21:48.450
NBC.

00:21:48.450 --> 00:21:50.930
Okay,

00:21:50.930 --> 00:21:51.310
All right,

00:21:51.310 --> 00:21:51.850
There we go.

00:21:51.850 --> 00:21:52.430
Um,

00:21:52.430 --> 00:21:53.470
essentially the logger.

00:21:53.470 --> 00:21:55.210
Now it it actually also.

00:21:55.210 --> 00:21:56.160
I'll put it to a file.

00:21:56.160 --> 00:21:58.010
So if we search for my app dot long,

00:21:58.010 --> 00:21:58.280
let's go.

00:21:58.280 --> 00:21:59.050
Actually do that.

00:21:59.050 --> 00:21:59.930
Ah,

00:21:59.930 --> 00:22:03.940
we can do my app dot log.

00:22:03.940 --> 00:22:05.360
And there we go.

00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.950
You'll actually see that we have to my app dot log.

00:22:06.950 --> 00:22:07.050
Here,

00:22:07.050 --> 00:22:08.050
let's go and open this up.

00:22:08.050 --> 00:22:10.970
Okay?

00:22:10.970 --> 00:22:13.280
And then we go and you'll see this actually happened.

00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.690
Um,

00:22:14.690 --> 00:22:17.970
right here we have dispatchers there cereals bringing NBC configures successfully.

00:22:17.970 --> 00:22:21.510
And this happened on 2017 11th 25.

00:22:21.510 --> 00:22:23.880
041 And you'll see here.

00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:26.990
That's 505 I mean,

00:22:26.990 --> 00:22:28.110
it doesn't show the second,

00:22:28.110 --> 00:22:28.320
but,

00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:28.640
you know,

00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:30.310
November 20th so yeah,

00:22:30.310 --> 00:22:32.350
that's just happened with this was just now.

00:22:32.350 --> 00:22:34.360
This is actually whoops.

00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.910
This is actually a file that was created.

00:22:36.910 --> 00:22:37.720
That sort of,

00:22:37.720 --> 00:22:38.350
um,

00:22:38.350 --> 00:22:39.760
helps us,

00:22:39.760 --> 00:22:40.320
you know,

00:22:40.320 --> 00:22:40.820
with,

00:22:40.820 --> 00:22:41.160
uh,

00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:42.480
whole longing thing.

00:22:42.480 --> 00:22:43.690
Okay,

00:22:43.690 --> 00:22:44.190
there we go.

00:22:44.190 --> 00:22:45.420
That's really just logging.

00:22:45.420 --> 00:22:51.660
One last thing that we need take a look at with logging is how we can actually use a longer

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:51.660
.

00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:53.660
Okay,

00:22:53.660 --> 00:22:54.990
so how we connect,

00:22:54.990 --> 00:22:57.790
how can we actually get a longer and actually log something?

00:22:57.790 --> 00:23:00.730
So getting a logger to which we can log Texas Pretty simple.

00:23:00.730 --> 00:23:02.980
Just use the static method.

00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.190
Get logger in the longer class.

00:23:05.190 --> 00:23:05.780
So,

00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:06.400
um,

00:23:06.400 --> 00:23:10.820
public static Final logger logger equals logger dot Get longer,

00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:12.070
my class dot class.

00:23:12.070 --> 00:23:16.990
It just takes my classroom class as the input and my class I was that class is actually

00:23:16.990 --> 00:23:17.400
rooted in.

00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:22.210
So it's going to take a look at how we can use this in our application that works with the

00:23:22.210 --> 00:23:24.090
students and classes with an array list.

00:23:24.090 --> 00:23:25.360
All right,

00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:26.120
so here we are.

00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.080
So let's just say that you know,

00:23:28.080 --> 00:23:29.800
when I initialize my array,

00:23:29.800 --> 00:23:30.460
I want a log,

00:23:30.460 --> 00:23:30.960
something.

00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:32.100
So I want to say,

00:23:32.100 --> 00:23:32.320
you know,

00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:32.920
at the end here,

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.520
initialized array.

00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.250
Ah,

00:23:35.250 --> 00:23:35.960
ray listlessly,

00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:37.960
a rich initialized array list.

00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:40.430
So what we would actually do is we would do,

00:23:40.430 --> 00:23:41.690
um right here.

00:23:41.690 --> 00:23:42.060
First of all,

00:23:42.060 --> 00:23:43.810
be would define a loggers we would do.

00:23:43.810 --> 00:23:44.650
Um,

00:23:44.650 --> 00:23:47.280
public actually knows to do private,

00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:47.730
you know,

00:23:47.730 --> 00:23:48.550
I don't know why I would need to.

00:23:48.550 --> 00:23:50.800
Private final,

00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.680
uh,

00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:59.770
logger logger equals blogger dot Yet logger get longer.

00:23:59.770 --> 00:24:00.970
And then the hello,

00:24:00.970 --> 00:24:05.850
world controller controller dot class.

00:24:05.850 --> 00:24:07.960
All right,

00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:08.580
there we go.

00:24:08.580 --> 00:24:09.120
OK,

00:24:09.120 --> 00:24:11.240
And now if we go out and do,

00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:11.840
um,

00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:16.650
longer dot and we actually have a couple of options now,

00:24:16.650 --> 00:24:17.820
we can do debug,

00:24:17.820 --> 00:24:18.410
weaken,

00:24:18.410 --> 00:24:18.930
do,

00:24:18.930 --> 00:24:19.700
um,

00:24:19.700 --> 00:24:21.090
info.

00:24:21.090 --> 00:24:22.380
We can do error.

00:24:22.380 --> 00:24:24.750
Weaken dio What else do we have here?

00:24:24.750 --> 00:24:27.750
Fatal as well and so on and so on.

00:24:27.750 --> 00:24:29.390
But let's just dio debug,

00:24:29.390 --> 00:24:30.840
um,

00:24:30.840 --> 00:24:32.630
and let's see the messages,

00:24:32.630 --> 00:24:33.000
um,

00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:39.590
initialized our array list of glasses.

00:24:39.590 --> 00:24:40.600
Okay,

00:24:40.600 --> 00:24:43.600
there we go initialized our array list of classes.

00:24:43.600 --> 00:24:43.900
All right,

00:24:43.900 --> 00:24:45.040
so now let's save this.

00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.420
Let's get a second to reload.

00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:46.790
Here.

00:24:46.790 --> 00:24:50.440
Um 18 0 there we go.

00:24:50.440 --> 00:24:51.140
It's reloading.

00:24:51.140 --> 00:24:51.590
And there we go.

00:24:51.590 --> 00:24:52.330
So it's reloaded.

00:24:52.330 --> 00:24:54.170
And now let's go to post men,

00:24:54.170 --> 00:24:57.010
OK,

00:24:57.010 --> 00:24:58.790
and now let's perform the unit method.

00:24:58.790 --> 00:24:59.580
Let's send it.

00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:00.670
All right.

00:25:00.670 --> 00:25:01.300
There we go.

00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.050
And now in eclipse.

00:25:03.050 --> 00:25:05.180
You'll see here how we have,

00:25:05.180 --> 00:25:06.890
um Where do we have?

00:25:06.890 --> 00:25:07.190
What?

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:07.690
We have it.

00:25:07.690 --> 00:25:08.220
There we go.

00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:11.270
So 2017 11 059 12.

00:25:11.270 --> 00:25:12.160
Debug default.

00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:13.310
Intentional handle mapping.

00:25:13.310 --> 00:25:14.170
Whoops.

00:25:14.170 --> 00:25:14.370
Nope.

00:25:14.370 --> 00:25:15.690
It's the wrong thing.

00:25:15.690 --> 00:25:17.590
Where did that happened?

00:25:17.590 --> 00:25:19.750
Ah!

00:25:19.750 --> 00:25:20.620
Oh,

00:25:20.620 --> 00:25:21.110
here we go.

00:25:21.110 --> 00:25:21.450
OK,

00:25:21.450 --> 00:25:22.720
so right here.

00:25:22.720 --> 00:25:24.640
2017 11th.

00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:25.250
Um,

00:25:25.250 --> 00:25:25.940
no.

00:25:25.940 --> 00:25:30.910
November 20th 05 12 49 debug.

00:25:30.910 --> 00:25:31.370
Hello,

00:25:31.370 --> 00:25:32.330
world controllers,

00:25:32.330 --> 00:25:33.430
This is the class name.

00:25:33.430 --> 00:25:33.700
Hello.

00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:35.950
World Controller for East.

00:25:35.950 --> 00:25:37.020
This is line 40.

00:25:37.020 --> 00:25:37.670
As you can see,

00:25:37.670 --> 00:25:41.570
40 initialized our array list of classes.

00:25:41.570 --> 00:25:42.140
So there we go.

00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:44.340
So we have now successfully used our,

00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.000
um,

00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:52.370
our longer to sort of log a message and so we can add a longer anywhere we want.

00:25:52.370 --> 00:25:59.030
So for debugging or finding info off the server and so on and so on So that my log is well

00:25:59.030 --> 00:25:59.030
,

00:25:59.030 --> 00:26:00.930
now my apt outlook.

00:26:00.930 --> 00:26:01.320
Whoops.

00:26:01.320 --> 00:26:01.730
Nope.

00:26:01.730 --> 00:26:09.010
Dad is not what I wanted to open my my app dot log.

00:26:09.010 --> 00:26:12.640
I think it was There we go.

00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.480
My dot log.

00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.980
Let's open it up and at the bottom.

00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:18.970
Here at the very bottom we should see.

00:26:18.970 --> 00:26:20.470
There we go.

00:26:20.470 --> 00:26:21.150
Debug.

00:26:21.150 --> 00:26:21.440
Hello.

00:26:21.440 --> 00:26:25.410
World Controller 40 initialized our array list of classes.

00:26:25.410 --> 00:26:26.100
Can I make this bigger?

00:26:26.100 --> 00:26:26.750
No,

00:26:26.750 --> 00:26:27.550
I cannot.

00:26:27.550 --> 00:26:28.580
Yep.

00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:29.700
I cannot make this bigger.

00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.030
But,

00:26:30.030 --> 00:26:30.410
you know,

00:26:30.410 --> 00:26:33.630
I guess if you can see it,

00:26:33.630 --> 00:26:34.370
then trust me,

00:26:34.370 --> 00:26:34.700
it's there.

00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:37.820
So initialized our array list of classes.

00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.350
I tried to make a bigger I can't in the consul.

00:26:40.350 --> 00:26:40.930
Okay,

00:26:40.930 --> 00:26:41.590
anyway,

00:26:41.590 --> 00:26:42.050
so there we go.

00:26:42.050 --> 00:26:44.970
Is that essentially how we use a longer it support to have a longer,

00:26:44.970 --> 00:26:45.940
you know,

00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:47.930
at least once a method that's,

00:26:47.930 --> 00:26:48.300
you know,

00:26:48.300 --> 00:26:49.310
ideal.

00:26:49.310 --> 00:26:49.750
Sort of.

00:26:49.750 --> 00:26:51.710
And you see a lot of different things here.

00:26:51.710 --> 00:26:52.350
Um,

00:26:52.350 --> 00:26:53.310
So,

00:26:53.310 --> 00:26:54.500
for example Ah,

00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:55.940
we have no model in view.

00:26:55.940 --> 00:26:57.160
Returned to dispatcher.

00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:58.000
Serve it with names.

00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:58.300
Spring,

00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.520
NBC assuming handler,

00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:00.650
adapter completed.

00:27:00.650 --> 00:27:02.460
Request handling.

00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.320
So,

00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:03.780
essentially,

00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.650
what that would this mean?

00:27:04.650 --> 00:27:10.110
So we can actually find a lot of interesting things actually happened with spring behind

00:27:10.110 --> 00:27:12.370
the scenes that we don't actually know about using,

00:27:12.370 --> 00:27:13.560
the longer it's,

00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:13.690
like,

00:27:13.690 --> 00:27:15.130
actually see a lot of them in action.

00:27:15.130 --> 00:27:17.540
That's pretty pretty fun.

00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:18.390
Anyway,

00:27:18.390 --> 00:27:19.930
that is how use the longer.

00:27:19.930 --> 00:27:20.850
No homework for today.

00:27:20.850 --> 00:27:21.180
Next time,

00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:22.950
we're going to look at how we can extend the project.

00:27:22.950 --> 00:27:23.560
And then after that,

00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:24.550
we don't want the course.

00:27:24.550 --> 00:27:25.260
Um,

00:27:25.260 --> 00:27:26.940
we actually went over a lot with this course,

00:27:26.940 --> 00:27:29.750
but I'll get a little bit more indepent next time.

00:27:29.750 --> 00:27:30.590
Yeah,

00:27:30.590 --> 00:27:31.000
former,

00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:31.340
I guess.

00:27:31.340 --> 00:27:31.940
Just in foul.

00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:34.160
Longer makes that runs pretty simple stuff.

00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:34.890
Um,

00:27:34.890 --> 00:27:35.210
and,

00:27:35.210 --> 00:27:35.840
uh yeah,

00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:38.550
I guess I'll see you next time for final lesson.
