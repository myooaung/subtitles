00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.080
Hello there.

00:00:01.080 --> 00:00:03.460
And welcome back to this spring development course.

00:00:03.460 --> 00:00:05.270
So in the last lesson,

00:00:05.270 --> 00:00:09.010
we actually will go went ahead and went over how we can create an application context and

00:00:09.010 --> 00:00:12.070
just install spring maven and an I d e,

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:14.840
which we can then create an application out of.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:18.450
So now we actually need to create our beans are XML file.

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:19.900
So inside SRC Main Joe,

00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:28.780
we're going to do new other XML xml file the next,

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:34.710
and we're gonna call this beans dot xml Okay.

00:00:34.710 --> 00:00:37.350
And let's put it in the SRC folder on the main folder.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:39.480
And there we go.

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:39.800
All right.

00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:40.890
Sounds good a source.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:43.710
And now we could actually do our being towed,

00:00:43.710 --> 00:00:44.150
XML.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:48.340
So we're also gonna go in and paste in the source for the XML tags.

00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:49.280
There's gonna be beans,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:49.820
xml,

00:00:49.820 --> 00:00:50.130
anus.

00:00:50.130 --> 00:00:51.910
And then these ah,

00:00:51.910 --> 00:00:52.620
links right here.

00:00:52.620 --> 00:00:54.710
They should be somewhere near,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:55.340
uh,

00:00:55.340 --> 00:00:55.760
you know,

00:00:55.760 --> 00:01:01.450
somewhere you're the video to the left or to the right or something.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:03.360
Okay.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.780
And then we're gonna close off beans as well.

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:05.200
All right,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:05.620
There we go.

00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.460
Now that we have our our,

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:08.050
um,

00:01:08.050 --> 00:01:10.720
source defined,

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:29.360
we can now do bean I d equals Let's just say zero point,

00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:29.950
OK?

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:40.250
Then we're going to do class equals com example,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:43.870
P k.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:44.260
G.

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:48.960
All right,

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:49.490
there we go.

00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:51.240
So and then also,

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:53.650
I forgot to the point class point.

00:01:53.650 --> 00:01:55.860
So then we're going to do,

00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:56.770
um,

00:01:56.770 --> 00:01:57.970
property.

00:01:57.970 --> 00:02:13.150
Property name equals X value equals zero.

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:16.400
All right,

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:17.000
there we go.

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:17.830
I believe,

00:02:17.830 --> 00:02:20.150
and actually don't need this cold temperatures to like this.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:21.330
Ah,

00:02:21.330 --> 00:02:21.900
and then I believe,

00:02:21.900 --> 00:02:23.460
actually that it was X ray.

00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:23.800
Yeah.

00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:24.710
Private index yet,

00:02:24.710 --> 00:02:25.340
OK.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.180
And they were gonna do same exact thing for why?

00:02:27.180 --> 00:02:31.210
Let's do this.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:36.450
10 point classes that we cannot see the effects on.

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:38.090
And it's gonna be 10 sort of zero.

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:38.750
There we go.

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:43.040
So now that what we're gonna do is we're gonna go back to our applications,

00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:44.240
start we're going to do,

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.050
um,

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:59.790
application context dot get being,

00:02:59.790 --> 00:03:07.810
and then the idea of the being that we've created So in this case,

00:03:07.810 --> 00:03:14.540
gonna be 0.10 that's gonna return the beans.

00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.830
So now we're gonna do point p equals application,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.850
and then we need to cast this two point.

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.630
There we go.

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:27.760
And now we can do system dot out dark print.

00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:30.900
Ellen P.

00:03:30.900 --> 00:03:37.880
Don't get X and then the same thing for p dot Get why?

00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.750
And there we go.

00:03:39.750 --> 00:03:40.830
All right,

00:03:40.830 --> 00:03:41.970
so now we're going to one last thing.

00:03:41.970 --> 00:03:44.880
Instead of putting beans into our SRC folder,

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:45.960
we're gonna put it into our job.

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.770
A folder since that What is technically the applicant?

00:03:47.770 --> 00:03:48.430
Um,

00:03:48.430 --> 00:03:49.800
class path.

00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:54.470
So inside Java right here was gonna drag it into their All right.

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:54.940
And there we go.

00:03:54.940 --> 00:04:01.190
So now we can run our application sold to applications Start run as Joe application.

00:04:01.190 --> 00:04:03.700
And there we go.

00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:03.830
So,

00:04:03.830 --> 00:04:04.260
as you can see,

00:04:04.260 --> 00:04:07.020
we're now having let me move the consul over here so that we can see a better.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:07.760
Okay,

00:04:07.760 --> 00:04:11.440
so you can see spring is actually initializing so we have org's spring framework,

00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:12.030
context,

00:04:12.030 --> 00:04:12.430
support,

00:04:12.430 --> 00:04:14.020
abstract application context.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.500
Prepare a fresh.

00:04:15.500 --> 00:04:18.430
So then it's refreshing it Ah,

00:04:18.430 --> 00:04:21.090
so startup route of context hierarchy.

00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.060
Then we have xml being definition reader load being definitions that sits reading the XML

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:32.540
and then loading XML being definitions from class path resource and then it prints P doc

00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:33.340
get X and Peter.

00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:33.930
I get why,

00:04:33.930 --> 00:04:34.800
which is 10 10.

00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.250
So there we go.

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:38.650
So what exactly is happening here?

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.450
Well,

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:44.060
our application contacts essentially just an object of spring.

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.160
Well,

00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:44.380
actually,

00:04:44.380 --> 00:04:47.610
no obligation Contact is an interface class path.

00:04:47.610 --> 00:04:51.160
Application context is an object that implements that interface,

00:04:51.160 --> 00:04:58.400
which actually gets our being definitions from an XML file inside our class path.

00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.530
In this case,

00:04:59.530 --> 00:05:00.700
it is beings dot xml.

00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:03.100
So it will look for a file called beans at XML,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:04.410
and it will find it.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.570
Since we have created,

00:05:05.570 --> 00:05:11.650
then it's gonna process that beans are xml file.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:12.720
Who so essentially,

00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:14.450
it's gonna take a look at it and see.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:15.770
Look,

00:05:15.770 --> 00:05:18.560
we have a bean here of i d point tens.

00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:20.790
That's its name and its class is calm.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:21.830
Example p k g.

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:22.390
Point.

00:05:22.390 --> 00:05:25.600
So this being that we've created here,

00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:32.390
then we assign it the property name X and value 10.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:36.650
So it creates a new object of type com example.

00:05:36.650 --> 00:05:41.860
P k g point then assigns X to 10 toe X and 10 toe y.

00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:45.350
Then when we call,

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.560
where is the application start?

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:53.200
Their ago when we call obligation context are get being ill just returned back that bean

00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.770
and then we just cast a two point put it MP,

00:05:55.770 --> 00:05:58.080
and then we print Peter get X and p don't get wine.

00:05:58.080 --> 00:06:03.140
So now insider beans that XML file If we go in and change 10 to,

00:06:03.140 --> 00:06:05.490
let's just say 56 this to,

00:06:05.490 --> 00:06:05.750
let's say,

00:06:05.750 --> 00:06:09.450
76 we can now read Run applications start,

00:06:09.450 --> 00:06:13.370
and a result would get 56 76.

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.730
So there we go.

00:06:14.730 --> 00:06:19.890
So now together we have already created a very basic application now.

00:06:19.890 --> 00:06:20.710
Analects Lesson.

00:06:20.710 --> 00:06:26.120
We're actually going going to be going over exactly what happens behind the scenes and how

00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.620
reading the actual beans are.

00:06:27.620 --> 00:06:31.450
XML file actually works homework.

00:06:31.450 --> 00:06:33.840
Your only job really is to go ahead and,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:34.730
um,

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:40.850
implement this application as well as to add another being just like point.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:42.140
It can be said of a point.

00:06:42.140 --> 00:06:43.900
You can have a baby,

00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:45.950
a three D point who's gonna have into X,

00:06:45.950 --> 00:06:46.750
Y and Z,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.100
and then that,

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:52.580
and then create another bean Inside beans are XML,

00:06:52.580 --> 00:06:57.150
which will be a three D point which will have its corresponding value and to get that back

00:06:57.150 --> 00:06:59.430
so it's not too difficult.

00:06:59.430 --> 00:07:01.730
It's essentially the same thing that as we did today,

00:07:01.730 --> 00:07:03.190
So it should be pretty simple,

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:04.230
really.

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:06.150
The main part is just to get this running on your machine.

00:07:06.150 --> 00:07:07.390
So anyway,

00:07:07.390 --> 00:07:08.610
I wish you luck with homework and,

00:07:08.610 --> 00:07:08.960
uh,

00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.800
also next time,

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.250
soon
