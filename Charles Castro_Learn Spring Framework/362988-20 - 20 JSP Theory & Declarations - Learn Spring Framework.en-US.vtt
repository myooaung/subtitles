00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.590
Hello there and welcome back to this spring development course.

00:00:03.590 --> 00:00:09.820
So last time we just went over the very basics of Jay's being served a very unorganized

00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:10.380
overview,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:10.770
sort of.

00:00:10.770 --> 00:00:14.620
They're gonna be having a little bit deeper and understanding what exactly everything means

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:14.620
.

00:00:14.620 --> 00:00:16.600
So without further ado,

00:00:16.600 --> 00:00:17.630
let's get interested.

00:00:17.630 --> 00:00:17.980
Listen,

00:00:17.980 --> 00:00:18.890
all right,

00:00:18.890 --> 00:00:19.790
so without further ado,

00:00:19.790 --> 00:00:21.020
let's get into today's lesson.

00:00:21.020 --> 00:00:23.360
I pretty sure already said that just now,

00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:24.080
but anyway,

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:24.770
let's get into it.

00:00:24.770 --> 00:00:26.190
Okay,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:26.420
so what,

00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.990
it just be so Java server pages?

00:00:28.990 --> 00:00:33.950
JBC Jake's B stand for Java server pages is a technology for developing Web pages that

00:00:33.950 --> 00:00:36.020
supports dynamic content.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.580
So webpages that support,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:38.910
you know,

00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:42.350
our Java code influencing HTML code.

00:00:42.350 --> 00:00:43.850
Um,

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:52.440
this helps developers insert Java code in HTML pages by making use of special date JSP tags

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:52.440
,

00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:54.990
most of which start with,

00:00:54.990 --> 00:00:55.320
you know,

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.910
left arrow percent and end with percent right there.

00:00:58.910 --> 00:01:00.430
Okay,

00:01:00.430 --> 00:01:00.990
so pretty simple.

00:01:00.990 --> 00:01:01.760
So pretty simple stuff.

00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:08.150
So just we can insert java code by using these these tax here and in between them putting

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:08.650
java code.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:09.470
Okay,

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:15.520
A Java server pages component is a type of Java servant that is designed to fulfill the

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:19.150
role of a user interface for a Java Web application.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.900
Web developers rage a species as text files that combined HTML or X html code XML elements

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:29.200
and embedded James P actions or command.

00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:29.860
So what does this mean?

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:31.320
That you're just ah,

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:41.120
lot of very simple stuff being said by some very complex being led by some very complex

00:01:41.120 --> 00:01:41.730
vocabularies.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:42.240
Essentially,

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.870
let's go over bit by bit.

00:01:43.870 --> 00:01:45.880
So a Java server pages component is the type of job,

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:49.030
a certain that that is designed to fit for the role of a user interface for a travel Web

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:49.510
occasion.

00:01:49.510 --> 00:01:54.930
So this just means that ah Java server pages sort of file,

00:01:54.930 --> 00:02:00.980
essentially just a file that is then create that is then sort of converted into a serval.

00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:01.260
It,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:02.160
um,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:05.950
which will then sort of display a,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.630
uh,

00:02:07.630 --> 00:02:07.980
you know,

00:02:07.980 --> 00:02:09.890
a Web page to the final user.

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:12.090
It's actually what it means here.

00:02:12.090 --> 00:02:13.110
By user interface.

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:15.030
This is just a user interface,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:17.380
essentially displaying the final webpage to the,

00:02:17.380 --> 00:02:18.180
um,

00:02:18.180 --> 00:02:22.340
user of the website.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:22.950
Okay,

00:02:22.950 --> 00:02:24.570
then afterwards,

00:02:24.570 --> 00:02:25.030
after that,

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.010
we have Web developers,

00:02:26.010 --> 00:02:29.750
right Jase PS text files that combined html or X html code,

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:32.500
external elements and embedded Jay's be actions and commands.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:38.080
So essentially HTML and X html are pretty much sort of their similar except html a little

00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:40.120
bit more strict on how you have to write it.

00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:41.440
But yeah,

00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.860
other than that,

00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:42.720
they're pretty much the same.

00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:45.280
And XML and HTML are actually very similar.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.070
If you take a look at how xml and how HTML works there,

00:02:49.070 --> 00:02:49.390
Actually,

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:50.370
there are actually very,

00:02:50.370 --> 00:02:50.990
very similar.

00:02:50.990 --> 00:02:52.300
So yeah.

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.640
Um okay,

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.230
so ah,

00:02:55.230 --> 00:02:55.960
Web developers.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.800
And so what that means is that to hear that Web developers righteous piece as text files,

00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.750
which Jason,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:04.560
you're just tax files and they combine html a Cosimo code,

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.440
eight external elements and embedded JCB actions and commands.

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:10.720
So here what embedded JCB actions and commands are,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.700
it means is that we have a series of sort of,

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:14.350
um,

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.330
specific things that we could do a jsp that help us achieve a goal sort of quicker.

00:03:19.330 --> 00:03:23.930
But one of those we looked at in the last lesson was actually request Don't get local

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:26.840
address as well as get remote address and port as well.

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:32.970
That is actually a jsp action that specifically ace be and that then will actually no,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:35.810
it's not specifically jsp so much other is to serve.

00:03:35.810 --> 00:03:36.450
Let's But nevertheless,

00:03:36.450 --> 00:03:41.310
it is an example of what you can do in jsp that you can do,

00:03:41.310 --> 00:03:41.610
you know,

00:03:41.610 --> 00:03:43.850
if you just display pure HTML.

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.850
Okay.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:45.450
Um,

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:46.060
so,

00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:46.280
yeah,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:46.770
other than that,

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:47.090
then,

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:47.630
um,

00:03:47.630 --> 00:03:49.750
let's take a look at exactly what we could do with it.

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:50.890
First of all,

00:03:50.890 --> 00:03:53.470
we're going to take a look at exactly what HTML is because,

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.020
I mean,

00:03:54.020 --> 00:03:56.550
you probably should have an idea of what is html.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:03:57.190
Um,

00:03:57.190 --> 00:04:00.290
since generally speaking,

00:04:00.290 --> 00:04:02.890
you should have an idea of what Java is,

00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:06.510
and you should have a basic idea of how surveillance work.

00:04:06.510 --> 00:04:09.150
So you should have an idea of how each team locks.

00:04:09.150 --> 00:04:09.940
But if you don't,

00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:11.080
let's just go over anyway.

00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:13.010
So html is actually a very simple thing.

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:16.200
It's there's a computer language and it's not a programming language is just called a

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.120
markup language.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:18.540
So it's a little bit is actually,

00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:18.950
um,

00:04:18.950 --> 00:04:22.260
HTM actually stands for hypertext markup language.

00:04:22.260 --> 00:04:23.590
So it's not a programming languages,

00:04:23.590 --> 00:04:24.450
a markup language,

00:04:24.450 --> 00:04:24.950
Phil,

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:25.630
computer language,

00:04:25.630 --> 00:04:29.080
which is the market device or allow website creation.

00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:32.480
These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet.

00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:34.720
HTML is not a programming language.

00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:35.660
It is a markup language.

00:04:35.660 --> 00:04:36.000
Yes,

00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.350
there what I was just talking about,

00:04:37.350 --> 00:04:38.140
Um,

00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:40.310
a shell is not run by the process directly.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.820
It is read by the Web browser,

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:45.150
which then displays page elements as specified in the HTML code.

00:04:45.150 --> 00:04:54.140
So if we have an HTML html file with a H one tag with a hello tag than the browser knows

00:04:54.140 --> 00:04:56.250
that we just need to display a header to the screen.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:59.880
So when we open a HTML five file with the Hatter Hello,

00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:00.410
Tag.

00:05:00.410 --> 00:05:02.290
We get this right here.

00:05:02.290 --> 00:05:07.880
So it knows that we need to essentially display hello to the screen and make it a little

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.650
bit bold since it is a church one and bigger as well.

00:05:10.650 --> 00:05:11.560
No.

00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.650
Im you might be thinking right now.

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:14.060
Well,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:14.490
I mean,

00:05:14.490 --> 00:05:16.430
if each browser displays it,

00:05:16.430 --> 00:05:17.560
it's on its own,

00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:18.050
sort of.

00:05:18.050 --> 00:05:22.640
Um then wouldn't there be problems between certain browsers?

00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.900
So maybe different browsers will display the content differently.

00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:28.340
And you would be correct in thinking that,

00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:32.770
And that actually is a big problem that we really don't have that much of a solution to.

00:05:32.770 --> 00:05:33.980
There are some solutions,

00:05:33.980 --> 00:05:35.710
like frameworks and libraries,

00:05:35.710 --> 00:05:36.470
that help with it.

00:05:36.470 --> 00:05:37.500
But nevertheless,

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:38.480
if you are developing,

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.180
I just appear HTML application.

00:05:40.180 --> 00:05:42.000
A pretty complex HTML application,

00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.050
then,

00:05:43.050 --> 00:05:43.500
um,

00:05:43.500 --> 00:05:44.000
with you know,

00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.350
a lot of different styling and,

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:45.650
um,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:47.840
a lot of different stuff like that.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:49.440
Then animations,

00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:54.290
especially then you will run into problems with different browsers displaying it

00:05:54.290 --> 00:05:55.110
differently.

00:05:55.110 --> 00:05:55.760
Luckily,

00:05:55.760 --> 00:06:00.880
there are the most popular browsers that these chrome Firefox and Safari and then after

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.180
that it's edge usually edges the oddball browser.

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:05.300
It doesn't support something,

00:06:05.300 --> 00:06:05.550
but,

00:06:05.550 --> 00:06:05.990
you know,

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:06.660
just generally being.

00:06:06.660 --> 00:06:08.060
That's how html work.

00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:12.110
So if you are a front end developer who is writing a lot of HTML code,

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:12.930
um,

00:06:12.930 --> 00:06:17.320
then you wouldn't need to make sure that it works the same or leaks.

00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.070
Looks decent on all for all browsers and not just,

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:21.210
you know,

00:06:21.210 --> 00:06:21.750
on one.

00:06:21.750 --> 00:06:22.760
Okay,

00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:26.480
that's just just over the html because HTML is actually what JSP is.

00:06:26.480 --> 00:06:32.630
JCB is essentially just a combination of Java and HTML code and sort of like J html coast.

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:33.840
Okay,

00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.030
so now finally,

00:06:35.030 --> 00:06:37.410
let's go dive into exactly what j speed us.

00:06:37.410 --> 00:06:39.610
There just be basic syntax,

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:43.490
so a scruple it can contain any number of Java language statements,

00:06:43.490 --> 00:06:45.000
variables or methods,

00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.530
declarations or expressions that are valid in the page.

00:06:48.530 --> 00:06:49.390
Scripting language.

00:06:49.390 --> 00:06:53.890
So here's the syntax for a script lit a script,

00:06:53.890 --> 00:06:59.180
a script lit is essentially just a piece of Java code that is inside Jsp.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:00.430
So here we have,

00:07:00.430 --> 00:07:01.660
ah,

00:07:01.660 --> 00:07:06.430
closing open left arrow percent sign and that I have the code here,

00:07:06.430 --> 00:07:11.260
whatever you want and then have the percent sign and then right here So we can also write

00:07:11.260 --> 00:07:13.340
the XML equivalent of the above indexes follow.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:15.360
So if we don't want to do this right here,

00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:16.160
we can just do,

00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:18.550
um Jsp scripless.

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:24.680
Just two jsp script attacks opening closing tags and then have a code Java code We want in

00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:25.050
here.

00:07:25.050 --> 00:07:26.130
Okay.

00:07:26.130 --> 00:07:29.660
And he take any text HTML tags or jace be elements.

00:07:29.660 --> 00:07:30.100
You right?

00:07:30.100 --> 00:07:32.600
Must be outside the script lit.

00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:37.300
Following is this simple and first example for Just be so here we have a JSP file now.

00:07:37.300 --> 00:07:41.150
There should actually be a lot of different code on top of it here,

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:44.120
so it's gonna be just a lot of them different XML library,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:47.750
sort of their or tag libraries that we're importing,

00:07:47.750 --> 00:07:50.530
which specially just tell our file or you know,

00:07:50.530 --> 00:07:51.900
you are file.

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:52.840
What exactly?

00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:53.680
We are,

00:07:53.680 --> 00:07:54.050
you know,

00:07:54.050 --> 00:07:56.400
writing.

00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.070
So generally speaking,

00:07:58.070 --> 00:08:02.150
you know how in java,

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:07.050
if you have head or actually in NJ speed So let's just say that you have,

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:07.690
you know ah,

00:08:07.690 --> 00:08:08.610
script lit here.

00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.210
Generally,

00:08:10.210 --> 00:08:10.860
XML,

00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:12.340
there is no such thing as a script lit.

00:08:12.340 --> 00:08:14.100
But thanks to the fact that we have,

00:08:14.100 --> 00:08:14.430
you know,

00:08:14.430 --> 00:08:17.480
we put our libraries here are tag libraries here.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:19.100
Java knows army.

00:08:19.100 --> 00:08:19.350
No,

00:08:19.350 --> 00:08:19.620
actually,

00:08:19.620 --> 00:08:24.650
XML knows the or whatever is parsing an XML knows that this right here is a script lit and

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:26.350
where you know what it means.

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:27.990
All right,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:28.940
So here in the anyway,

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:29.840
here is a,

00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:30.450
um,

00:08:30.450 --> 00:08:32.270
an example.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.870
So first we have ahead here with a title.

00:08:34.870 --> 00:08:35.460
Hello,

00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:35.890
world.

00:08:35.890 --> 00:08:36.410
OK,

00:08:36.410 --> 00:08:37.670
then we have a body.

00:08:37.670 --> 00:08:40.560
So it's just the title that's gonna display on top in the tab.

00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.420
Then we have a body here and in the body.

00:08:42.420 --> 00:08:43.760
We have the text Hello,

00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:44.360
world,

00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:47.030
And then we have we break.

00:08:47.030 --> 00:08:48.070
And then we print,

00:08:48.070 --> 00:08:49.000
um,

00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.780
request our get remote address,

00:08:50.780 --> 00:08:50.910
which,

00:08:50.910 --> 00:08:51.270
essentially,

00:08:51.270 --> 00:08:57.590
just something that the service it provides itself and you can actually do You can't

00:08:57.590 --> 00:09:00.240
actually do in html obviously.

00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:01.880
So this actually Java code,

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:03.270
and this Java code helps us Do,

00:09:03.270 --> 00:09:03.480
you know,

00:09:03.480 --> 00:09:06.350
display the remote address of the request.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.760
OK,

00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.800
All right,

00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:10.690
let's go in and actually take a look at some of the things we could do with J.

00:09:10.690 --> 00:09:10.850
C.

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:12.070
We already did this in the last lesson.

00:09:12.070 --> 00:09:15.390
So we're gonna skip this in doing actually doing it.

00:09:15.390 --> 00:09:16.450
Okay,

00:09:16.450 --> 00:09:17.110
Declarations.

00:09:17.110 --> 00:09:21.750
So a declaration eso declaration declares one or more values,

00:09:21.750 --> 00:09:24.330
variables or methods that we can use in Java code.

00:09:24.330 --> 00:09:26.120
Later in the JSP file,

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:30.930
you must declare the variable or method before you use it in the JSP file following its

00:09:30.930 --> 00:09:32.110
index for JCP declarations.

00:09:32.110 --> 00:09:33.650
So a declaration,

00:09:33.650 --> 00:09:38.210
if you don't know it's actually it's some when we actually create a variable in Joe.

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:39.900
So here we have an example here,

00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.680
so int I equals year left the declaration,

00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:42.240
for example,

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:43.360
into ABC here.

00:09:43.360 --> 00:09:44.390
That's also declaration.

00:09:44.390 --> 00:09:46.140
And then here's circle equals you Circle.

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:46.910
That's all.

00:09:46.910 --> 00:09:47.580
Declaration.

00:09:47.580 --> 00:09:47.790
So,

00:09:47.790 --> 00:09:48.020
yeah,

00:09:48.020 --> 00:09:49.770
he was a general syntax for us.

00:09:49.770 --> 00:09:50.800
So we have declaration,

00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:52.240
declaration and so on and so on.

00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:53.350
So just after with a,

00:09:53.350 --> 00:09:54.290
um,

00:09:54.290 --> 00:09:57.630
semi colon after each declaration,

00:09:57.630 --> 00:09:58.450
just Aiken jump,

00:09:58.450 --> 00:10:01.360
you can write the XML equivalent over the books injectors follow.

00:10:01.360 --> 00:10:09.220
So you do Jsp declaration instead of jcb script lit here we have JCB declaration and also

00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:09.500
here,

00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:14.020
instead of having left sign percents left aero percent,

00:10:14.020 --> 00:10:17.350
we have left their percent and then a question and then exclamation work.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:20.770
And JCB knows that we're actually declaring a variable and not,

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:20.950
you know,

00:10:20.950 --> 00:10:23.050
actually writing drama code so we can't write,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:23.410
you know,

00:10:23.410 --> 00:10:25.830
inside here we can't write his rump Ritalin,

00:10:25.830 --> 00:10:26.320
for example.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.950
So this is a declaration.

00:10:27.950 --> 00:10:29.470
All right,

00:10:29.470 --> 00:10:29.870
let's go.

00:10:29.870 --> 00:10:30.420
Actually,

00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:30.860
actually,

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:31.100
yeah,

00:10:31.100 --> 00:10:33.170
Let's go out and actually take a look at how this will work in the code.

00:10:33.170 --> 00:10:34.270
All right,

00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:36.790
so here we are in our original file.

00:10:36.790 --> 00:10:37.620
Um,

00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:44.410
this is the file where we actually created our last Jsp sort of overview where we took a

00:10:44.410 --> 00:10:44.850
look at it.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.100
So it's going to lead our existing code,

00:10:47.100 --> 00:10:49.010
and we cannot take a look at some things in,

00:10:49.010 --> 00:10:49.850
um,

00:10:49.850 --> 00:10:51.420
Andrzej,

00:10:51.420 --> 00:10:52.570
speak here that we have.

00:10:52.570 --> 00:10:52.670
So,

00:10:52.670 --> 00:10:52.990
first of all,

00:10:52.990 --> 00:10:55.310
we have this tag left 0%.

00:10:55.310 --> 00:10:55.580
Add,

00:10:55.580 --> 00:10:58.640
we're gonna go over exactly what this means lay in Iran.

00:10:58.640 --> 00:10:59.280
Ah,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:02.720
but generally all this is doing essentially just saying telling us that we have,

00:11:02.720 --> 00:11:03.530
you know,

00:11:03.530 --> 00:11:06.000
um Ah.

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:06.820
Jsp file.

00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:08.450
Here's essentially just get in order.

00:11:08.450 --> 00:11:13.150
Not a nice thing to do jcb just giving some information to whatever will be reading this

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:13.950
file.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.650
Okay,

00:11:15.650 --> 00:11:16.760
So essentially,

00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:20.940
now was going take a look at how exactly we can declare something sort of.

00:11:20.940 --> 00:11:21.870
So remember,

00:11:21.870 --> 00:11:27.970
it is left arrow percent and exclamation mark now here,

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:28.230
actually,

00:11:28.230 --> 00:11:28.540
actually.

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:30.820
Articulation So into a equals zero,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:31.400
for example.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:32.930
And now,

00:11:32.930 --> 00:11:34.500
inside a regular script.

00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:38.700
Lit weaken do Whoops.

00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:39.050
Nope.

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:39.810
Uh,

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.440
A There we go.

00:11:41.440 --> 00:11:42.120
You know,

00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:44.550
we'll just do out dot print Ellen.

00:11:44.550 --> 00:11:46.090
Okay.

00:11:46.090 --> 00:11:47.810
All right.

00:11:47.810 --> 00:11:48.420
There we go.

00:11:48.420 --> 00:11:49.240
Now,

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.730
something we can't actually do we can to do is out Dart print.

00:11:52.730 --> 00:11:53.550
Ellen here.

00:11:53.550 --> 00:11:59.550
What's one second print on?

00:11:59.550 --> 00:12:00.900
I can't type today for some reason.

00:12:00.900 --> 00:12:03.120
There you go.

00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:03.640
As you can see,

00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:06.680
we actually gives an error the next Aaron talk in Berlin.

00:12:06.680 --> 00:12:07.150
Identify.

00:12:07.150 --> 00:12:08.000
Expected after this.

00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:08.270
Tony,

00:12:08.270 --> 00:12:09.320
is that really what this means?

00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:10.130
Essentially,

00:12:10.130 --> 00:12:14.320
what this means is that it can actually perform this operation since this is only for

00:12:14.320 --> 00:12:15.010
declarations.

00:12:15.010 --> 00:12:16.970
Same goes for a system,

00:12:16.970 --> 00:12:18.150
but our different land as well.

00:12:18.150 --> 00:12:19.650
Okay.

00:12:19.650 --> 00:12:21.090
All right,

00:12:21.090 --> 00:12:22.310
so now let's actually run this coat.

00:12:22.310 --> 00:12:24.720
Let's go and start up with my server.

00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:25.580
Now,

00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:29.260
my star actually is going to be running on a laptop,

00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:31.280
so you should see you.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:34.210
Sure you should maybe hear the fans sort of start to spin up.

00:12:34.210 --> 00:12:39.290
Since I mean mill apples making basically running a server and running our server is not

00:12:39.290 --> 00:12:39.690
easy.

00:12:39.690 --> 00:12:41.170
So if you do hear it,

00:12:41.170 --> 00:12:42.520
then you know that you know.

00:12:42.520 --> 00:12:43.050
You know why?

00:12:43.050 --> 00:12:43.810
All right,

00:12:43.810 --> 00:12:47.000
so it's gonna actually take a look at how this will work in the browser.

00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:48.560
Google Chrome.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.220
All right,

00:12:49.220 --> 00:12:50.210
so it's gonna actually do it.

00:12:50.210 --> 00:12:51.530
Let's just do,

00:12:51.530 --> 00:12:52.250
um,

00:12:52.250 --> 00:12:59.530
local host 80 80 slash Web artifact appreciates.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:12:59.870
Hello,

00:12:59.870 --> 00:13:00.350
world.

00:13:00.350 --> 00:13:01.340
Nope.

00:13:01.340 --> 00:13:01.680
Uh,

00:13:01.680 --> 00:13:06.820
let me take a look at exactly what the correct get Messa.

00:13:06.820 --> 00:13:07.560
There we go.

00:13:07.560 --> 00:13:11.090
That was the extension that I decided to add to it.

00:13:11.090 --> 00:13:11.750
There we go.

00:13:11.750 --> 00:13:12.900
All right.

00:13:12.900 --> 00:13:14.160
And now,

00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:14.720
as you can see,

00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:15.850
it prints zero.

00:13:15.850 --> 00:13:16.460
So,

00:13:16.460 --> 00:13:17.030
um,

00:13:17.030 --> 00:13:18.210
right here in our code,

00:13:18.210 --> 00:13:20.340
we have zero.

00:13:20.340 --> 00:13:22.000
So we have into a equals zero.

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.950
Then when we print a to the to the document,

00:13:24.950 --> 00:13:26.230
we get zero.

00:13:26.230 --> 00:13:27.850
If we change this to four,

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:31.640
and I'm actually to see if it will re compile in theory,

00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:32.780
perhaps it will,

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:34.840
um saved it.

00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:34.970
Now,

00:13:34.970 --> 00:13:36.930
if I rerun it there we go gets for now.

00:13:36.930 --> 00:13:41.190
So our JSP automatically re compiles every single time we returned to it.

00:13:41.190 --> 00:13:42.190
Yeah,

00:13:42.190 --> 00:13:42.530
Okay.

00:13:42.530 --> 00:13:43.750
So that essentially how that works.

00:13:43.750 --> 00:13:47.900
Now we can also use the JSP Declaration Tax weaken.

00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:54.350
Do jsp Jace be declaration.

00:13:54.350 --> 00:13:57.050
There we go.

00:13:57.050 --> 00:13:59.150
And then inside here,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:13:59.770
we can do,

00:13:59.770 --> 00:14:00.200
uh,

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.750
into a equals zero.

00:14:01.750 --> 00:14:04.230
What is due first?

00:14:04.230 --> 00:14:05.110
57.

00:14:05.110 --> 00:14:07.050
Okay.

00:14:07.050 --> 00:14:07.760
Ah,

00:14:07.760 --> 00:14:08.390
and for some reason,

00:14:08.390 --> 00:14:09.350
they give me an error.

00:14:09.350 --> 00:14:13.340
The word is not supposed correctly.

00:14:13.340 --> 00:14:13.750
That's odd.

00:14:13.750 --> 00:14:19.620
I can I can assure them that it is.

00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:19.900
Okay,

00:14:19.900 --> 00:14:21.000
let's let's run this anyway.

00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:21.400
See what?

00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:25.170
We get More than 6 57 Okay,

00:14:25.170 --> 00:14:25.650
Well,

00:14:25.650 --> 00:14:28.070
for some reason,

00:14:28.070 --> 00:14:31.280
we actually get more than I think.

00:14:31.280 --> 00:14:36.670
This may be a bug of jsp or perhaps just eclipse giving us this.

00:14:36.670 --> 00:14:37.640
Okay,

00:14:37.640 --> 00:14:39.200
so after researching this issue online for,

00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:39.600
like,

00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.460
I don't need a couple of minutes actually found out that's actually a fairly common problem

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:44.460
.

00:14:44.460 --> 00:14:44.970
And,

00:14:44.970 --> 00:14:45.930
um so,

00:14:45.930 --> 00:14:46.060
yeah,

00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.890
that's just up above eclipse.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:52.300
When it reads the declaration here,

00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.150
it actually it,

00:14:54.150 --> 00:14:54.790
for some reason,

00:14:54.790 --> 00:14:57.120
says that into the not supposed correctly I don't really know why,

00:14:57.120 --> 00:14:58.490
but you know bugs are bugs.

00:14:58.490 --> 00:14:59.760
Maybe it'll be fixed someday.

00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:00.710
Even know anyway.

00:15:00.710 --> 00:15:01.510
So if you get this,

00:15:01.510 --> 00:15:02.200
don't worry about it.

00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:03.220
Won't actually affect the code.

00:15:03.220 --> 00:15:03.880
And in anyway,

00:15:03.880 --> 00:15:06.040
um and I I also Reese,

00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:07.870
I realized that I put one extra thing here,

00:15:07.870 --> 00:15:08.720
so yeah,

00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:09.350
I believe that.

00:15:09.350 --> 00:15:09.760
There we go.

00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:11.270
Zonal stuff is let's save this fire.

00:15:11.270 --> 00:15:12.360
Let's go to our browser.

00:15:12.360 --> 00:15:14.500
Uh,

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:15.170
where is it?

00:15:15.170 --> 00:15:15.700
There we go.

00:15:15.700 --> 00:15:16.850
And let's refresh.

00:15:16.850 --> 00:15:17.350
And there we go.

00:15:17.350 --> 00:15:21.610
675 Prince A here,

00:15:21.610 --> 00:15:22.170
we declared.

00:15:22.170 --> 00:15:22.770
Okay,

00:15:22.770 --> 00:15:25.510
so one of the advantages of using a declaration,

00:15:25.510 --> 00:15:26.680
um I mean,

00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:27.850
you may be wondering why don't we just,

00:15:27.850 --> 00:15:28.090
you know,

00:15:28.090 --> 00:15:29.350
do this right here?

00:15:29.350 --> 00:15:30.650
Um,

00:15:30.650 --> 00:15:34.400
just a regular script it Then we can do into a equals zero here.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:35.000
And there we go.

00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:35.690
So it works,

00:15:35.690 --> 00:15:36.160
you know,

00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:37.240
just like the declaration,

00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:37.520
right?

00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:38.640
As you can see,

00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:39.120
no errors.

00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:40.040
Everything is working correctly.

00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:42.600
We could actually go actually refresh your browser here,

00:15:42.600 --> 00:15:43.100
dear.

00:15:43.100 --> 00:15:44.010
Everything works correctly.

00:15:44.010 --> 00:15:48.650
So why even use declaration may actually going delete these XML tax would just use the

00:15:48.650 --> 00:15:53.340
scribbling tags here just a short time ago.

00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:58.130
So why should we even use this declaration tag if you could just use the script attack.

00:15:58.130 --> 00:15:58.510
Right?

00:15:58.510 --> 00:15:59.180
Well,

00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:03.560
that's because we can declare methods and decoration class something that we cannot do in.

00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:04.440
Uh,

00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:05.450
the script attacks.

00:16:05.450 --> 00:16:11.400
So we're gonna dio public public void print one,

00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:12.030
for example,

00:16:12.030 --> 00:16:16.660
here and then inside the method do system dot out of print.

00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:19.350
Ellen one,

00:16:19.350 --> 00:16:20.060
for example.

00:16:20.060 --> 00:16:22.500
Put a semi colon there.

00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:25.560
You'll see we actually get an error so it can't actually perform.

00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:26.560
Avoid here,

00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.540
so you can't do that.

00:16:27.540 --> 00:16:31.450
But if we copy this and paste this into here,

00:16:31.450 --> 00:16:33.360
then we get a problem.

00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:33.790
So we'll see.

00:16:33.790 --> 00:16:34.650
We get no airs here,

00:16:34.650 --> 00:16:38.850
and we can now call rent one from here.

00:16:38.850 --> 00:16:40.240
There we go.

00:16:40.240 --> 00:16:41.640
Let's save this.

00:16:41.640 --> 00:16:43.310
And now let's in our browser.

00:16:43.310 --> 00:16:44.580
Let's refresh now.

00:16:44.580 --> 00:16:45.500
We don't get anything,

00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.250
but here we have print one.

00:16:47.250 --> 00:16:47.700
So a prince,

00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:48.910
once we do system that outfit up,

00:16:48.910 --> 00:16:49.560
Gwendolyn one.

00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:50.520
There we go.

00:16:50.520 --> 00:16:50.810
Yeah,

00:16:50.810 --> 00:16:56.360
let's see how we can declare methods so we can Onley declare methods inside J speed

00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:58.120
declarations and not,

00:16:58.120 --> 00:16:58.510
you know,

00:16:58.510 --> 00:16:59.400
in script.

00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.810
Let's that's That's one of the benefits of using JSP declarations on top of the fact that,

00:17:03.810 --> 00:17:04.060
you know,

00:17:04.060 --> 00:17:06.650
just organize things look better all right,

00:17:06.650 --> 00:17:11.150
so that essentially it for part one of this jsp overview nothing.

00:17:11.150 --> 00:17:15.230
We're gonna be going over the rest of jsp and then moving on to some more fun stuff,

00:17:15.230 --> 00:17:16.560
but yeah.

00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:16.870
Anyway,

00:17:16.870 --> 00:17:17.880
for this time going on,

00:17:17.880 --> 00:17:18.280
um,

00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:21.830
get if you didn't have jcb running on your machine already going and running on your

00:17:21.830 --> 00:17:22.390
machine.

00:17:22.390 --> 00:17:23.130
Go ahead.

00:17:23.130 --> 00:17:23.690
And,

00:17:23.690 --> 00:17:24.460
um,

00:17:24.460 --> 00:17:26.070
take a look at what we did here.

00:17:26.070 --> 00:17:29.530
Make sure you do everything that we did here,

00:17:29.530 --> 00:17:30.210
so don't you know,

00:17:30.210 --> 00:17:32.070
copy my code award forward,

00:17:32.070 --> 00:17:36.300
trying to understand what exactly I did and then recreate that in your own coat,

00:17:36.300 --> 00:17:38.250
maybe chasing stuff around maybe current application,

00:17:38.250 --> 00:17:38.880
if really want,

00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:40.500
get some errors,

00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:41.450
look them up.

00:17:41.450 --> 00:17:43.050
Do you like that?

00:17:43.050 --> 00:17:43.840
All right,

00:17:43.840 --> 00:17:44.160
so anyway,

00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:44.720
um,

00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:45.600
without further do,

00:17:45.600 --> 00:17:46.820
then I'll see you next time.

00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:51.130
We'll where we're gonna we're gonna go over the rest of what exactly jcp is and how it

00:17:51.130 --> 00:17:51.640
works.

00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:52.320
And,

00:17:52.320 --> 00:17:52.520
uh,

00:17:52.520 --> 00:17:52.810
yeah,
