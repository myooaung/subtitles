00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
Hello there.

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:02.680
And welcome back to this spring development,

00:00:02.680 --> 00:00:03.270
Of course.

00:00:03.270 --> 00:00:11.030
So last time we went over the very basics of rest AP eyes in spring and us more to do your

00:00:11.030 --> 00:00:13.390
job was to create a rest endpoint,

00:00:13.390 --> 00:00:17.850
which would return an error message along with an error status coat.

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:22.120
So here is essentially what you should have done.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.760
So here I have my request mapping with the value slash air.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:26.860
So just went to slash error.

00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:29.710
It'll go tos controller or actually arrest endpoint.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:31.180
We at rest controller years.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.740
Then he are a turn a response entity with a string generic.

00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:35.540
Um,

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:39.440
And then I hear when I said that that that's what we're going to return and then here

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:39.840
actually do.

00:00:39.840 --> 00:00:42.060
Return is where turned new response entity.

00:00:42.060 --> 00:00:43.360
String error.

00:00:43.360 --> 00:00:44.700
Your request is an error.

00:00:44.700 --> 00:00:49.050
And then with the status http status dot internal server air,

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:51.050
which I think is 500.

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:51.960
I'm not Charlie.

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:52.150
Sure,

00:00:52.150 --> 00:00:52.400
buddy.

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:53.510
I'm pretty sure it's 100 years.

00:00:53.510 --> 00:00:54.670
Okay,

00:00:54.670 --> 00:00:57.730
so now it's going to actually run this and let's see how it actually works in the browser.

00:00:57.730 --> 00:01:05.700
There we go.

00:01:05.700 --> 00:01:06.070
Um,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:06.960
Sarasota Pain,

00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:09.050
2.4 seconds.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:10.950
I was gonna go to Google Chrome.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.520
All right,

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:15.160
there we go.

00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.980
And let's refresh,

00:01:16.980 --> 00:01:18.080
and there we go.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.260
So we'll see how that first of all,

00:01:19.260 --> 00:01:19.860
we have error.

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.880
You requested air,

00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:22.460
so that's working correctly.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:23.330
And then also,

00:01:23.330 --> 00:01:24.700
we have an error here,

00:01:24.700 --> 00:01:26.980
Uh,

00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:28.050
of type 500.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.530
Gather we go.

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.820
So status 500.

00:01:30.820 --> 00:01:32.850
There we go.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.510
So that is essentially how we do how we do that.

00:01:35.510 --> 00:01:36.180
Now,

00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:41.650
let me see if I can actually give you a better idea what is going on here?

00:01:41.650 --> 00:01:44.610
Nope.

00:01:44.610 --> 00:01:44.830
Nope.

00:01:44.830 --> 00:01:45.170
This is,

00:01:45.170 --> 00:01:47.650
um this is the entire Okay,

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:48.570
there we go.

00:01:48.570 --> 00:01:49.870
That essentially how we do that?

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:52.340
So now it's going to take a look at Jumper J lesson.

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:52.840
Um,

00:01:52.840 --> 00:02:00.330
they were gonna be going over mawr about how exactly we create a rest A p I All right.

00:02:00.330 --> 00:02:05.440
So building arrest a b I a little bit more difficult than we sort of went over in that in

00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.350
the last lesson.

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:07.220
Um,

00:02:07.220 --> 00:02:12.200
and one of my main parts that we didn't really go over is how we could actually get input.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.650
So I mean,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:14.650
it's great and all that we can,

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:14.920
you know,

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.530
say,

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:17.900
get how the world and it returns for the world.

00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:21.000
But usually we're gonna want to get something else.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.070
So some input.

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:22.180
So,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:22.660
for example,

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.310
if we have,

00:02:23.310 --> 00:02:23.650
you know,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:24.650
um,

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:27.290
an a p i for a,

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:27.600
uh,

00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.940
no currency converter,

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.410
then you're gonna have some input.

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:31.470
You're gonna have What?

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:35.690
What exactly what currencies you want to convert like the first currency,

00:02:35.690 --> 00:02:36.910
The second very currency.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:39.450
The amount of currency that you want to convert.

00:02:39.450 --> 00:02:40.410
Um,

00:02:40.410 --> 00:02:42.070
maybe the language that you wanted,

00:02:42.070 --> 00:02:42.520
Rex,

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:42.770
you know that?

00:02:42.770 --> 00:02:42.880
Well,

00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:43.050
I mean,

00:02:43.050 --> 00:02:44.290
you got that language.

00:02:44.290 --> 00:02:46.470
It doesn't really doesn't really work there.

00:02:46.470 --> 00:02:46.680
But,

00:02:46.680 --> 00:02:47.000
you know,

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:47.360
you see,

00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:47.860
we have three.

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:51.210
So the currency you're gonna it's in the currents you want to convert it to,

00:02:51.210 --> 00:02:53.850
and they have value that you actually want to convert.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:03:00.580
So now we don't actually have a way to do that in our a p I s that we're gonna be taking a

00:03:00.580 --> 00:03:01.450
look at today.

00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:03.260
Alright,

00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:03.880
so first of all,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.030
we're gonna have a data source.

00:03:05.030 --> 00:03:05.910
This is gonna be a data store.

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:06.340
So usually,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:08.100
if we were building arrest AP,

00:03:08.100 --> 00:03:13.650
I we would have a database that we would connect to in order to get data for our A P I.

00:03:13.650 --> 00:03:14.650
But to do that,

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.700
we wouldn't have to go over data access.

00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:17.360
So for this course,

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:20.630
we're just going to we're going to create our own static data source.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:22.380
We'll just have a list of users.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.720
So we're gonna have a list of users are see?

00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:24.960
Well,

00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.320
they're actually gonna be students,

00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.150
not users.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:27.810
Um,

00:03:27.810 --> 00:03:29.730
but yet so,

00:03:29.730 --> 00:03:30.230
essentially,

00:03:30.230 --> 00:03:32.650
just our data starts from which we will,

00:03:32.650 --> 00:03:32.950
you know,

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:35.670
get get values put values into one.

00:03:35.670 --> 00:03:38.190
So right here we have three different lists.

00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:41.040
So this is gonna be class one's gonna be class two,

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.810
and it's going to class three just in order.

00:03:42.810 --> 00:03:44.640
So class one as Bill,

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:44.870
Bob,

00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:45.120
Matt,

00:03:45.120 --> 00:03:45.370
John,

00:03:45.370 --> 00:03:47.020
Mark and Jack classed you as Jesse,

00:03:47.020 --> 00:03:50.050
you vet Calvin and Soil Ba spoiler.

00:03:50.050 --> 00:03:52.560
And then class three has Marinella,

00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:53.240
Zenobia,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:54.150
Mickey and Gilbert.

00:03:54.150 --> 00:03:55.750
So pretty simple stuff.

00:03:55.750 --> 00:03:56.930
All right,

00:03:56.930 --> 00:04:02.380
so now let's go ahead and go to the getting values from our euros.

00:04:02.380 --> 00:04:04.000
Are we gonna get that lease from a year ago?

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:06.780
So to get values from our your l will,

00:04:06.780 --> 00:04:10.280
we will use path variables is something called path variable.

00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:13.830
This will get a value using slash and then in square brackets,

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:17.030
value name which we can then get in our controller.

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:18.150
Here's how we would do that.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:26.130
So you'll see here how in our request mapping we have value equals slash Get students slash

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:29.650
Inside a curly brackets class I d.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:32.220
So no matter what we put there,

00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:32.920
it could be,

00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:33.320
you know,

00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:35.480
one or two or a 1,000,000.

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:36.770
No matter what we put there,

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.560
it will still map it to this.

00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:43.990
It will still map it to this controller.

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:45.400
Okay?

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.210
And that our method will be request method dot Get Okay,

00:04:50.210 --> 00:04:54.340
so we have at response body annotation here just to return plain text and not,

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:54.750
you know,

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:56.050
the view name.

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.670
So then we have public string gets students and then we have the at path variable

00:05:00.670 --> 00:05:02.630
annotation into your class I d.

00:05:02.630 --> 00:05:06.230
And it will see how we actually have a name.

00:05:06.230 --> 00:05:08.960
Class I d here and then in our earl,

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.030
we have class I d a path variable.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:13.880
And so it'll put two and two together,

00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:15.160
sort of and,

00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.450
uh,

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:17.170
automatically pass in this glass.

00:05:17.170 --> 00:05:20.110
I d variable into this class.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:22.450
80 integer objects.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:28.410
Then we just return students dog get class I D minus 1.2 strings.

00:05:28.410 --> 00:05:32.050
That's just converts the so whatever.

00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:34.290
And we do Class I d minus one here since remember,

00:05:34.290 --> 00:05:36.480
arrays start counting from zero,

00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.430
and same with the lists as well.

00:05:38.430 --> 00:05:40.360
So if we input,

00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:40.770
you know,

00:05:40.770 --> 00:05:41.250
um,

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:43.670
our rain number one,

00:05:43.670 --> 00:05:46.070
it's gonna give us number zero since you know,

00:05:46.070 --> 00:05:48.450
just to make a little more humanly readable.

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:49.480
Okay,

00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.000
um,

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.120
and then we convert that to a string.

00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.740
Pretty simple stuff so share and are in our mapping results by that class i d.

00:05:54.740 --> 00:05:56.790
The students of which we want to get.

00:05:56.790 --> 00:06:01.530
And then we get the i d from the girl using the app path variable annotation before

00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:06.770
specifying method input Variable that we return the given student list Converted to strings

00:06:06.770 --> 00:06:08.750
are dispatcher service knows what to do with it.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.950
So let's go ahead and actually take a look at how this will work in the code.

00:06:12.950 --> 00:06:14.440
All right,

00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.080
so here we are.

00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:15.710
Um,

00:06:15.710 --> 00:06:17.580
let's go ahead and Ah,

00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:18.950
delete this.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:20.320
Okay,

00:06:20.320 --> 00:06:20.750
So here,

00:06:20.750 --> 00:06:23.450
we're gonna have at request mapping,

00:06:23.450 --> 00:06:27.550
okay?

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:29.880
At request mapping,

00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:33.970
and then we're gonna have value equals slash,

00:06:33.970 --> 00:06:40.500
get students slash and then in curly brackets,

00:06:40.500 --> 00:06:41.500
brackets class,

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:41.950
I d.

00:06:41.950 --> 00:06:43.230
There we go.

00:06:43.230 --> 00:06:54.300
And then we're gonna have method equals H g t b method dot That was important to keep new

00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:54.850
method.

00:06:54.850 --> 00:06:56.420
Ah,

00:06:56.420 --> 00:06:57.460
whoops wise.

00:06:57.460 --> 00:06:59.680
Why is wise is not working.

00:06:59.680 --> 00:07:00.140
Okay.

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.140
Age to be method dark.

00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:04.900
Get since for some reason Ah,

00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:05.250
whoops.

00:07:05.250 --> 00:07:07.450
And open open It was gonna be request method.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:11.290
There we go.

00:07:11.290 --> 00:07:12.430
Okay.

00:07:12.430 --> 00:07:14.790
And that you're gonna have at response body,

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:21.800
and then we have public static void main.

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:24.030
Uh,

00:07:24.030 --> 00:07:25.030
what What What's what are we doing?

00:07:25.030 --> 00:07:25.200
What?

00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:26.150
We remain here?

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:29.150
Public string,

00:07:29.150 --> 00:07:36.650
Get students students,

00:07:36.650 --> 00:07:39.280
Okay.

00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:48.130
And then we're gonna have at path variable integer class I d.

00:07:48.130 --> 00:07:48.630
And remember,

00:07:48.630 --> 00:07:51.450
it'll put two and two together by the name of the variable.

00:07:51.450 --> 00:07:53.020
Um,

00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:55.070
And then where is gonna return?

00:07:55.070 --> 00:08:08.190
Return students dot And I know we don't have a student's object yet.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:09.850
We're gonna We're gonna cut that in a second.

00:08:09.850 --> 00:08:14.740
Students don't get a glass.

00:08:14.740 --> 00:08:17.750
I d minus 1.2.

00:08:17.750 --> 00:08:21.000
All right.

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:21.610
And there we go.

00:08:21.610 --> 00:08:22.100
Ok,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:26.650
so first of all me import response Body response body.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:27.740
There we go.

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:28.390
Second of all,

00:08:28.390 --> 00:08:28.710
let me go.

00:08:28.710 --> 00:08:31.160
Actually paste in our,

00:08:31.160 --> 00:08:31.630
um,

00:08:31.630 --> 00:08:34.250
students student list.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:35.650
All right,

00:08:35.650 --> 00:08:39.780
so it's basic in there we go.

00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:40.160
OK,

00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:43.550
so that's our student lists or just you know what we had in the power point previously?

00:08:43.550 --> 00:08:44.450
A.

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:44.560
So,

00:08:44.560 --> 00:08:45.650
now would we?

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:46.970
Whenever we refer to here,

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:47.260
we will.

00:08:47.260 --> 00:08:49.870
Yet students start get quantity minus one door to string.

00:08:49.870 --> 00:08:50.690
All right,

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:55.330
so pretty simple stuff is going to actually run the server and let's see what we will get.

00:08:55.330 --> 00:08:56.660
Let's say the changes.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.980
All right,

00:09:00.980 --> 00:09:01.750
here we go.

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:05.950
So now it's good and go to the browser and let's see what we get there.

00:09:05.950 --> 00:09:08.250
So in our browser,

00:09:08.250 --> 00:09:12.050
we're going to look most 80 80 web artifact.

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:14.520
And then we're gonna do,

00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:15.250
um,

00:09:15.250 --> 00:09:21.360
yet students and then we need a class to actually get it from So it's gonna let's do the

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.370
first class.

00:09:22.370 --> 00:09:23.950
This is going to be the very first class,

00:09:23.950 --> 00:09:28.250
and we actually we actually get an error here for some reason in particular.

00:09:28.250 --> 00:09:29.850
What exactly is happening?

00:09:29.850 --> 00:09:32.150
Ah,

00:09:32.150 --> 00:09:35.650
slash guest students slash class I d.

00:09:35.650 --> 00:09:37.710
In here is so far,

00:09:37.710 --> 00:09:42.880
we have web artifact slash get students slash class I d one.

00:09:42.880 --> 00:09:43.140
Yeah,

00:09:43.140 --> 00:09:44.950
it looks like it looks like it's working.

00:09:44.950 --> 00:09:47.750
Um,

00:09:47.750 --> 00:09:49.280
okay,

00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:49.460
well,

00:09:49.460 --> 00:09:51.780
the mapping isn't getting maximum.

00:09:51.780 --> 00:09:52.150
You let me go.

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:59.750
And actually okay,

00:09:59.750 --> 00:10:03.350
let me go and take a look at everyone's hoping what's going on here and then I will get

00:10:03.350 --> 00:10:04.090
back to you was gonna be,

00:10:04.090 --> 00:10:04.460
like,

00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:05.250
a second.

00:10:05.250 --> 00:10:07.980
Okay,

00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:08.460
there we go.

00:10:08.460 --> 00:10:09.190
That explains a lot.

00:10:09.190 --> 00:10:10.820
So when we actually started a server,

00:10:10.820 --> 00:10:12.900
it actually didn't didn't save the file,

00:10:12.900 --> 00:10:15.150
so it didn't actually have this get students.

00:10:15.150 --> 00:10:16.210
So let me go.

00:10:16.210 --> 00:10:16.720
Actually,

00:10:16.720 --> 00:10:22.130
it's important to save your file and then start the server as opposed to starter server,

00:10:22.130 --> 00:10:23.470
and then save your file,

00:10:23.470 --> 00:10:25.740
so that will save you some trouble.

00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:25.990
Okay.

00:10:25.990 --> 00:10:27.660
And now when we refresh the page,

00:10:27.660 --> 00:10:28.110
there we go.

00:10:28.110 --> 00:10:29.160
We get Bill,

00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:29.590
Bob,

00:10:29.590 --> 00:10:29.970
Matt,

00:10:29.970 --> 00:10:30.630
John,

00:10:30.630 --> 00:10:32.180
Mark and Jack.

00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:33.960
And then in our clips file,

00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:35.490
you'll see that the very first,

00:10:35.490 --> 00:10:38.200
um uh,

00:10:38.200 --> 00:10:39.290
class is Bill,

00:10:39.290 --> 00:10:39.530
Bob,

00:10:39.530 --> 00:10:39.870
Matt,

00:10:39.870 --> 00:10:40.230
John,

00:10:40.230 --> 00:10:40.930
Mark and Jack.

00:10:40.930 --> 00:10:42.540
So the 2nd 1 is Jesse Evette,

00:10:42.540 --> 00:10:43.420
Calvin and Soil.

00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:46.850
And then when we change this one to it to here,

00:10:46.850 --> 00:10:54.080
we get just that very same thing that we were expecting to get so pretty simple stuff,

00:10:54.080 --> 00:10:55.710
pretty useful stuff on,

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:56.440
and obviously,

00:10:56.440 --> 00:10:58.300
in actual enterprise application,

00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:02.790
we would could be connecting this to some kind of database where we'll be getting it from,

00:11:02.790 --> 00:11:05.250
but for art set for our case,

00:11:05.250 --> 00:11:06.250
um,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:09.770
let's just do it through the list.

00:11:09.770 --> 00:11:12.450
Because then connecting it to a database isn't all that difficult.

00:11:12.450 --> 00:11:14.010
Uh,

00:11:14.010 --> 00:11:14.640
all right.

00:11:14.640 --> 00:11:14.960
I mean,

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.410
I mean,

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:20.660
changing the rest ap ice that it works with a database and not something else isn't

00:11:20.660 --> 00:11:26.240
difficult connecting a database with actual values that can get a little bit more difficult

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:26.240
.

00:11:26.240 --> 00:11:27.830
That's why we're actually we're not going over it.

00:11:27.830 --> 00:11:29.230
In this course since again,

00:11:29.230 --> 00:11:30.820
this course would be very,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:31.350
very long.

00:11:31.350 --> 00:11:32.150
Okay,

00:11:32.150 --> 00:11:33.030
so we know without further ado,

00:11:33.030 --> 00:11:37.850
then let's go take a look at some other things that we can do with arrest a p I.

00:11:37.850 --> 00:11:38.920
All right.

00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:41.570
So how can we get values from a post request?

00:11:41.570 --> 00:11:42.620
So usually,

00:11:42.620 --> 00:11:45.310
when we create or use arrest AP,

00:11:45.310 --> 00:11:47.310
I we will be using post.

00:11:47.310 --> 00:11:49.400
And while we can get values from the u.

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:49.960
R l,

00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:53.030
it can get tedious if you want to get a lot of different inputs.

00:11:53.030 --> 00:11:53.900
For that,

00:11:53.900 --> 00:11:59.290
we would get inputs from a request and we do that using the at request Haram annotation.

00:11:59.290 --> 00:12:03.810
So here we are using it using the at request for an meditation.

00:12:03.810 --> 00:12:06.260
So we have a request meant mapping valuable slash,

00:12:06.260 --> 00:12:08.950
get students method equals request method Dart Post.

00:12:08.950 --> 00:12:13.350
So we're gonna be using the post 80 to be method and not yet http method.

00:12:13.350 --> 00:12:18.300
Then we have an at response body here just so that we can return a string and not a view

00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:18.750
name.

00:12:18.750 --> 00:12:23.920
Then we do public string gets students and then at request parameter class I d.

00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:28.580
So this was a go look at the request parameter and try to find class i d.

00:12:28.580 --> 00:12:29.590
If there isn't one,

00:12:29.590 --> 00:12:30.850
then we will get an air.

00:12:30.850 --> 00:12:31.760
Okay?

00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:35.440
And then we have signed into an integer class ideas that we just returned two and start Get

00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:37.260
class I d minus one don't to strength.

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:37.680
Okay,

00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:38.350
so pretty simple.

00:12:38.350 --> 00:12:38.780
Now,

00:12:38.780 --> 00:12:39.540
generally speaking,

00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:43.030
since we are actually getting something we'll probably use get here.

00:12:43.030 --> 00:12:43.410
But,

00:12:43.410 --> 00:12:43.670
you know,

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:49.090
just for the sake of demonstration issues post So here we get a request parameter a request

00:12:49.090 --> 00:12:51.160
program parameter named Class I d.

00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:52.950
Using the A request premeditation.

00:12:52.950 --> 00:12:56.730
We then assign it to a into a method input Class I D.

00:12:56.730 --> 00:12:59.530
Which we then used to return the given student name list.

00:12:59.530 --> 00:13:04.440
Know that we assign the controller to only handle post requests during using method equals

00:13:04.440 --> 00:13:05.160
Christ method.

00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:05.780
Dark post.

00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.050
So let's go and take a look at how this will work in the code.

00:13:09.050 --> 00:13:10.160
All right,

00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:10.840
here we are.

00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.690
Um,

00:13:11.690 --> 00:13:16.270
let's go ahead and set this to post.

00:13:16.270 --> 00:13:16.850
First of all,

00:13:16.850 --> 00:13:19.010
there we go.

00:13:19.010 --> 00:13:19.340
Um,

00:13:19.340 --> 00:13:20.180
and second of all,

00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:21.450
that's going to eat this.

00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:24.730
Okay.

00:13:24.730 --> 00:13:25.930
And now,

00:13:25.930 --> 00:13:26.950
instead of path variable,

00:13:26.950 --> 00:13:34.440
we're gonna have request Aram and instead of integer actually were graph indigenas.

00:13:34.440 --> 00:13:34.810
Well,

00:13:34.810 --> 00:13:36.850
and so everything else stays exactly the same.

00:13:36.850 --> 00:13:40.650
So now it's going to go to our browser and let's see how exactly we can do this.

00:13:40.650 --> 00:13:43.650
So it was going to go too far ing.

00:13:43.650 --> 00:13:46.050
And now if we go here,

00:13:46.050 --> 00:13:52.320
you actually see a weps?

00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:52.810
Nope.

00:13:52.810 --> 00:13:56.250
I think I forgot to start the server now.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:13:57.130
Spoiler alert.

00:13:57.130 --> 00:13:57.750
What?

00:13:57.750 --> 00:13:58.150
Nope,

00:13:58.150 --> 00:13:58.500
Nope.

00:13:58.500 --> 00:13:58.720
Nope.

00:13:58.720 --> 00:13:59.480
Let's cancel this.

00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.950
We have to save it.

00:14:00.950 --> 00:14:02.750
And only then do we run it.

00:14:02.750 --> 00:14:04.310
Okay.

00:14:04.310 --> 00:14:05.370
Spoiler alert.

00:14:05.370 --> 00:14:10.650
It won't actually work since our browser will use the get method by default.

00:14:10.650 --> 00:14:12.070
And it won't use the post method,

00:14:12.070 --> 00:14:13.260
so you can see here.

00:14:13.260 --> 00:14:14.050
Request method.

00:14:14.050 --> 00:14:14.990
Get not supportive.

00:14:14.990 --> 00:14:20.000
So the browser will try to make a get request to our a p I.

00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.030
So this present problem,

00:14:23.030 --> 00:14:24.840
we need to use,

00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:26.000
not a get request.

00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.090
We need to use a post request.

00:14:27.090 --> 00:14:28.290
How can we do this?

00:14:28.290 --> 00:14:28.630
Well,

00:14:28.630 --> 00:14:29.470
there a couple ways.

00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:34.470
We can actually just use something called CRL in the terminal.

00:14:34.470 --> 00:14:35.500
So a consul,

00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:36.600
Um or,

00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:36.950
uh,

00:14:36.950 --> 00:14:40.270
it would be cmd in windows.

00:14:40.270 --> 00:14:41.130
Um,

00:14:41.130 --> 00:14:41.670
but,

00:14:41.670 --> 00:14:41.910
you know,

00:14:41.910 --> 00:14:43.890
that's a little bit of an un elegant solution.

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:46.080
And in the past couple of years,

00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.230
pretty much every single company that I've worked for have actually been using this really

00:14:50.230 --> 00:14:54.250
awesome tool called Postman that's gonna install Install it really quickly.

00:14:54.250 --> 00:14:55.460
All right.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:56.290
So you're Sol.

00:14:56.290 --> 00:14:59.650
Both men's postman is going to go to a postman,

00:14:59.650 --> 00:15:02.940
probably there ago.

00:15:02.940 --> 00:15:03.240
So,

00:15:03.240 --> 00:15:03.730
postman,

00:15:03.730 --> 00:15:04.350
there we go.

00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:06.280
Developing ap AP Eyes is hard.

00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.490
Postman makes it easy.

00:15:07.490 --> 00:15:09.480
So pretty simple stuff Got Mac os,

00:15:09.480 --> 00:15:10.510
windows and Lennox,

00:15:10.510 --> 00:15:13.250
so everything you could possibly need.

00:15:13.250 --> 00:15:15.110
There we go.

00:15:15.110 --> 00:15:17.850
Your download will begin automatically in a few seconds.

00:15:17.850 --> 00:15:19.170
Here we go.

00:15:19.170 --> 00:15:20.250
It's downloading.

00:15:20.250 --> 00:15:23.250
Let's give it a minute here.

00:15:23.250 --> 00:15:27.830
All right,

00:15:27.830 --> 00:15:28.360
there we go.

00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:29.380
It installs going.

00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:35.990
Open it up and you don't know.

00:15:35.990 --> 00:15:38.360
All right.

00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:39.380
He needs to verify,

00:15:39.380 --> 00:15:39.880
postman.

00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:46.450
Open it up and it's moving the satellites into position.

00:15:46.450 --> 00:15:49.750
Okay,

00:15:49.750 --> 00:15:50.100
there we go.

00:15:50.100 --> 00:15:52.680
So now we just actually sign up to sign into postman,

00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:53.660
or you can sign up.

00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:55.130
So go and do that.

00:15:55.130 --> 00:15:56.460
I'm gonna do that right now.

00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:58.890
And there we go.

00:15:58.890 --> 00:15:59.670
Okay.

00:15:59.670 --> 00:16:02.270
So now So now postman is actually pretty simple to use.

00:16:02.270 --> 00:16:03.800
Just go out and do right your unit.

00:16:03.800 --> 00:16:05.190
Enter your U R L.

00:16:05.190 --> 00:16:10.770
Then you can do Select what you want to what sort of type of request you want to send.

00:16:10.770 --> 00:16:11.910
Then you could use the,

00:16:11.910 --> 00:16:12.170
you know,

00:16:12.170 --> 00:16:12.760
headers,

00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.020
ad request,

00:16:14.020 --> 00:16:14.720
scripts,

00:16:14.720 --> 00:16:16.730
parameters and so on and so on.

00:16:16.730 --> 00:16:16.840
So,

00:16:16.840 --> 00:16:17.070
yes,

00:16:17.070 --> 00:16:20.290
a lot of things we can actually insert into here,

00:16:20.290 --> 00:16:21.250
So let's go ahead.

00:16:21.250 --> 00:16:21.620
Actually,

00:16:21.620 --> 00:16:33.780
do a post request two local host 80 80 slash web artifact slash endless Do get students.

00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:36.110
All right,

00:16:36.110 --> 00:16:36.690
there we go.

00:16:36.690 --> 00:16:38.710
And then we're gonna add a parameter.

00:16:38.710 --> 00:16:41.850
Let's have the parameter class I d.

00:16:41.850 --> 00:16:44.500
And let's say the value is one.

00:16:44.500 --> 00:16:45.150
Okay,

00:16:45.150 --> 00:16:45.560
All right,

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:45.920
There we go.

00:16:45.920 --> 00:16:47.350
Leno send this request.

00:16:47.350 --> 00:16:49.580
Okay,

00:16:49.580 --> 00:16:52.000
So there's others that there's a There's a problem connecting,

00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.230
um,

00:16:53.230 --> 00:17:03.980
go to eclipse What seems to be the problems get students get students Web artifact.

00:17:03.980 --> 00:17:04.570
Whoops.

00:17:04.570 --> 00:17:07.010
It's a local host.

00:17:07.010 --> 00:17:07.550
There we go.

00:17:07.550 --> 00:17:11.760
Okay.

00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.700
I put local a host.

00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.460
Let me get your Oh,

00:17:15.460 --> 00:17:15.960
there we go.

00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:16.350
All right,

00:17:16.350 --> 00:17:19.360
So now we've sent a post request we've used,

00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:19.810
you know,

00:17:19.810 --> 00:17:20.810
class I D.

00:17:20.810 --> 00:17:21.530
Um,

00:17:21.530 --> 00:17:25.030
instead of adding in slash slash you know,

00:17:25.030 --> 00:17:26.710
one and the end result,

00:17:26.710 --> 00:17:28.880
that actually makes things easier.

00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.380
And that's how we can do it with Post.

00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:33.560
So postman is actually a really useful application.

00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:34.410
And,

00:17:34.410 --> 00:17:34.660
uh,

00:17:34.660 --> 00:17:35.040
again,

00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:35.520
as I said,

00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:38.890
I've worked for ah couple companies in the past couple of years,

00:17:38.890 --> 00:17:41.490
and ever since policeman came out whenever we were building an A p I,

00:17:41.490 --> 00:17:42.310
um,

00:17:42.310 --> 00:17:46.210
either they were already using Postman Or as soon as I said yes,

00:17:46.210 --> 00:17:47.050
it both when they were like,

00:17:47.050 --> 00:17:48.150
this is the best thing ever.

00:17:48.150 --> 00:17:48.770
So yeah,

00:17:48.770 --> 00:17:50.100
so a really good application.

00:17:50.100 --> 00:17:50.720
Um,

00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.970
I'd highly recommend you downloaded.

00:17:52.970 --> 00:17:53.250
I'm not,

00:17:53.250 --> 00:17:53.610
You know,

00:17:53.610 --> 00:17:55.590
I know I'm not sponsored by and by that,

00:17:55.590 --> 00:17:56.770
I am by them or anything.

00:17:56.770 --> 00:17:59.500
If they want to sponsor me for a paid.

00:17:59.500 --> 00:17:59.760
You didn't.

00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:00.160
Of course.

00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:00.530
Then you know,

00:18:00.530 --> 00:18:01.150
while means,

00:18:01.150 --> 00:18:02.850
But I'm I'm not,

00:18:02.850 --> 00:18:04.080
unfortunately,

00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:04.560
I guess.

00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:05.110
Okay.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:05.410
Anyway,

00:18:05.410 --> 00:18:07.360
somehow we use postman to send a post request.

00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:11.870
Now it's going to take a look at how we can use different methods to accomplish different

00:18:11.870 --> 00:18:12.030
things.

00:18:12.030 --> 00:18:12.630
And by the way,

00:18:12.630 --> 00:18:20.530
if we actually don't have a parameter that our spring you know we'll need if we send it now

00:18:20.530 --> 00:18:21.650
you'll see that we actually get,

00:18:21.650 --> 00:18:22.350
um,

00:18:22.350 --> 00:18:26.440
that's ever cannot soak required inter parameter class i D is not present.

00:18:26.440 --> 00:18:29.800
And then same goes for if we have class I D.

00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.360
And then something like string,

00:18:31.360 --> 00:18:32.160
for example.

00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.970
Um then this also so will not press that process request due to something that perceived to

00:18:36.970 --> 00:18:38.000
be a climate error.

00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:42.870
So it's looking for an integer when the result we put a string here and then if we put like

00:18:42.870 --> 00:18:43.810
a four here,

00:18:43.810 --> 00:18:45.630
then it also won't be able to get it.

00:18:45.630 --> 00:18:47.320
Since there's only three,

00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.050
Um,

00:18:48.050 --> 00:18:49.910
there's only three,

00:18:49.910 --> 00:18:50.760
um,

00:18:50.760 --> 00:18:52.050
you know,

00:18:52.050 --> 00:18:54.770
inputs inside our list of students.

00:18:54.770 --> 00:18:58.740
So if we can actually create a try,

00:18:58.740 --> 00:19:01.460
catch exception so that if it's more than so,

00:19:01.460 --> 00:19:02.130
if it's you know,

00:19:02.130 --> 00:19:05.070
if again exception that it's more than three,

00:19:05.070 --> 00:19:07.250
then we essentially sort of,

00:19:07.250 --> 00:19:07.550
um,

00:19:07.550 --> 00:19:08.480
were no return.

00:19:08.480 --> 00:19:09.270
There's an error.

00:19:09.270 --> 00:19:10.540
As you put,

00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:12.090
there's not enough elements to get,

00:19:12.090 --> 00:19:13.000
you know,

00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.050
whatever you whatever you got.

00:19:15.050 --> 00:19:16.930
And that same goes for if we have,

00:19:16.930 --> 00:19:17.420
um,

00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:19.230
you know,

00:19:19.230 --> 00:19:21.300
the wrong name,

00:19:21.300 --> 00:19:22.700
then we'll also class.

00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:23.530
It is not present.

00:19:23.530 --> 00:19:23.880
So Yeah,

00:19:23.880 --> 00:19:24.660
reasonable stuff.

00:19:24.660 --> 00:19:25.850
That's how that works.

00:19:25.850 --> 00:19:26.540
All right.

00:19:26.540 --> 00:19:27.770
And so yeah,

00:19:27.770 --> 00:19:28.150
on that,

00:19:28.150 --> 00:19:29.200
then that's it for this lesson.

00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:29.910
Next time,

00:19:29.910 --> 00:19:33.880
we're gonna go over how we can use different request method,

00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:36.740
do it methods to accomplish different things.

00:19:36.740 --> 00:19:38.240
No homework with lesson.

00:19:38.240 --> 00:19:39.740
We're gonna have homework next time.

00:19:39.740 --> 00:19:41.590
Just understand exactly what's going on here.

00:19:41.590 --> 00:19:43.680
Get this on your computer and understand.

00:19:43.680 --> 00:19:48.200
Understand exactly what's happening whenever we do a certain thing at any part of the code

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:48.200
.

00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.300
So yeah.

00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:49.780
Anyway,

00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:50.550
without further ado,

00:19:50.550 --> 00:19:51.780
then you have any horror.

00:19:51.780 --> 00:19:52.940
But I still wish you luck because,

00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:53.230
you know,

00:19:53.230 --> 00:19:53.570
I mean,

00:19:53.570 --> 00:19:54.110
why not,

00:19:54.110 --> 00:19:54.460
right?
