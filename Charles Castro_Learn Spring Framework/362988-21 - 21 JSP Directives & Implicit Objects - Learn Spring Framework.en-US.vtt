00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.790
Hello there.

00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:02.250
And welcome back to this spring development.

00:00:02.250 --> 00:00:02.750
Of course.

00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:06.350
So last time we are doing look at how exactly Jsp works,

00:00:06.350 --> 00:00:08.680
they're gonna be diving a little bit deeper.

00:00:08.680 --> 00:00:08.790
Well,

00:00:08.790 --> 00:00:08.960
I mean,

00:00:08.960 --> 00:00:10.670
I guess last time we took what do we do?

00:00:10.670 --> 00:00:11.700
A little bit deeper Brazilian.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:15.200
Today we're gonna be going over the rest of exactly using JSP.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:16.490
So without further ado,

00:00:16.490 --> 00:00:17.680
let's get started.

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:18.520
All right.

00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:21.330
So let's take a look at the JSP directors,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:26.900
so I just be directive affect The overall structure of the survey class usually has a

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:27.750
falling form.

00:00:27.750 --> 00:00:29.060
And remember,

00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:34.180
J servants are senator just compiled or translated into surveillance.

00:00:34.180 --> 00:00:35.250
So Java service,

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:37.980
the following form Ah,

00:00:37.980 --> 00:00:42.950
left arrow percent ATS directive and the attributes and values.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.980
Okay.

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.020
And so they're essentially three types of directive tags.

00:00:47.020 --> 00:00:50.670
So we have page at page,

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:54.160
so defines page dependent attributes such as scripting language,

00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:57.340
error page and buffering requirements.

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:57.870
Essentially,

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.590
this is just directors,

00:00:59.590 --> 00:00:59.860
actually,

00:00:59.860 --> 00:01:02.400
their whole separate thing and I can spend,

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:02.570
you know,

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:03.750
a lot of time talking about them,

00:01:03.750 --> 00:01:05.180
and they're actually,

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:07.660
but this really isn't a jsp score so much,

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:08.020
is it?

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.050
As it is a spring frame or course,

00:01:10.050 --> 00:01:14.290
So we're just gonna be going over the very basic of them and then not diving into the rest

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:18.990
because you know that had that that will take the entire course anyway.

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.150
Include,

00:01:20.150 --> 00:01:22.890
tag includes a file during the translation face.

00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:25.550
This is when it translates from,

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:32.520
um from from Jsp to John was frivolous.

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:33.790
And then tablets.

00:01:33.790 --> 00:01:37.360
Who declares a tag library containing two custom actions used in the page.

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.110
So an example of a tag library is actually called the C library,

00:01:41.110 --> 00:01:42.930
which actually isn't a bunch of handy things.

00:01:42.930 --> 00:01:43.060
Like,

00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:43.700
for example,

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:50.560
we can actually generate over a list directly inside HTML using HTML tags and not,

00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:50.790
you know,

00:01:50.790 --> 00:01:51.490
Java code.

00:01:51.490 --> 00:01:51.960
So,

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:52.150
yes,

00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:53.450
that's one of the examples.

00:01:53.450 --> 00:01:55.460
So these directives,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:59.050
you couldn't go over to look them up and if you're really interested in them,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:00.580
But you know,

00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:03.570
you don't necessarily need to know that 100% to be a spring developer,

00:02:03.570 --> 00:02:03.910
but yes,

00:02:03.910 --> 00:02:05.450
so if they are good to know,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:06.400
all right,

00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:08.660
so let's go and actually really that much.

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:09.200
Take a look here,

00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.700
but it's actually going to take a look at an example of where we can use them in the code.

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:13.730
Okay.

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.220
So versatile.

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:14.780
At the shop here,

00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:16.160
you can actually see page.

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:17.500
So we have a at page tank.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.430
You're just That's just that's just an example of a directive that we using jsp.

00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:24.300
Now,

00:02:24.300 --> 00:02:25.480
let's can't be an hour.

00:02:25.480 --> 00:02:25.720
See,

00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:26.570
tag library.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.650
And we're gonna do that using this line of code here.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.340
So we have,

00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:30.780
um,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.760
tablet prefix seats.

00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:34.220
Just maybe the prefix for attack,

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:37.090
and then the your eye Is this your right here?

00:02:37.090 --> 00:02:39.250
So this is just a Jameson calm,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.510
Jace PJ stale course.

00:02:40.510 --> 00:02:45.400
This is just the location worth actually located looking and save this on now.

00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:45.670
We can,

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:45.990
actually,

00:02:45.990 --> 00:02:47.050
if we actually do,

00:02:47.050 --> 00:02:47.980
um,

00:02:47.980 --> 00:02:49.850
this we cannot do see.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.150
And then we have a bunch of different options here.

00:02:53.150 --> 00:02:58.050
So we actually going to remove this for now?

00:02:58.050 --> 00:03:01.000
So let's remove it,

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:01.480
save it.

00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:01.980
And now,

00:03:01.980 --> 00:03:04.510
if we do see you see,

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:05.460
we actually don't get anything.

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:13.910
But if we add this in and save it and now we get to see or,

00:03:13.910 --> 00:03:14.230
uh,

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:17.750
no second Well,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.030
don't auto completing for some reason,

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:20.750
but okay,

00:03:20.750 --> 00:03:22.950
you get the idea.

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.670
There we go.

00:03:24.670 --> 00:03:25.430
Um,

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:26.890
And so now we can do see if,

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.730
for example,

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:35.370
um um And then he was gonna put a script lit with a thank here we're gonna do.

00:03:35.370 --> 00:03:36.350
Um,

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:39.840
I'll just say one is more than two.

00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:45.800
No,

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:46.770
I was gonna be bullion.

00:03:46.770 --> 00:03:52.800
There we go.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.160
Okay.

00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:55.580
And so here,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.650
there's gonna do Hello World,

00:03:56.650 --> 00:03:57.210
for example.

00:03:57.210 --> 00:03:58.750
And in theory,

00:03:58.750 --> 00:03:59.650
this should work.

00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:01.550
Let me take a look if this will actually work.

00:04:01.550 --> 00:04:03.850
We started in our CNO.

00:04:03.850 --> 00:04:04.840
It doesn't actually work.

00:04:04.840 --> 00:04:05.400
Actually,

00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:05.600
no,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:05.860
wait.

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:09.710
Let's change this to 21 just to see if it does work.

00:04:09.710 --> 00:04:10.950
Because you,

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:11.640
in theory,

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:15.230
you would actually need to use a different tack for this.

00:04:15.230 --> 00:04:16.250
Let's go to Chrome.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.170
Yeah,

00:04:18.170 --> 00:04:19.500
so does it Doesn't actually work.

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:20.050
Um,

00:04:20.050 --> 00:04:23.720
you're even though you have to is less than one or so we had one is more than to stash.

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.610
This should have worked.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:31.860
We have to use a different something else here we have to use in this case,

00:04:31.860 --> 00:04:35.050
we have to use the dollar sign,

00:04:35.050 --> 00:04:41.550
and then one is more than two or is less than two in this case.

00:04:41.550 --> 00:04:43.300
And now if we're on this,

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:50.050
you are 11 is less than three years of that.

00:04:50.050 --> 00:04:51.330
And there we go.

00:04:51.330 --> 00:04:52.380
Finally works Okay,

00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:53.260
So essentially here,

00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:56.200
what happens is that this right here returns a Boolean.

00:04:56.200 --> 00:04:56.660
So in this case,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.180
because one is less than two,

00:04:58.180 --> 00:04:59.970
we'll take a look at what this does later on.

00:04:59.970 --> 00:05:00.640
But here,

00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:04.450
what is important to understand that when we have one lesson do it returns a 1,000,000,000

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.680
then in this case,

00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:06.810
test is no is true.

00:05:06.810 --> 00:05:10.800
And then it will do whole the world if we do too is less than one.

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:14.500
And now we changed to Google Chrome.

00:05:14.500 --> 00:05:16.300
We get nothing,

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.230
so it doesn't actually show.

00:05:17.230 --> 00:05:19.490
That's that's just an example of what we can use,

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:24.770
what we can do using the C library and how we can import the sea like library using the tag

00:05:24.770 --> 00:05:25.850
lib directive.

00:05:25.850 --> 00:05:26.950
All right,

00:05:26.950 --> 00:05:29.170
So don't take a look at some other things that we could do with jsp.

00:05:29.170 --> 00:05:30.320
Okay,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.590
so there's also this thing called jace be implicit object.

00:05:33.590 --> 00:05:41.410
So implicit objects are essentially just things that are existent in jsp that are sort of

00:05:41.410 --> 00:05:45.880
that we can use these air objects that we can use to perform Zoran operations.

00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:46.240
So,

00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:46.830
for example,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:49.220
we actually did see how we can use the request.

00:05:49.220 --> 00:05:50.090
Um,

00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:57.030
the request object to get the remote address or the local address on the port of the server

00:05:57.030 --> 00:05:57.420
as well.

00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:00.050
So that's an example of what can you So of course,

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:03.410
this is the http service request object associated with the request.

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:09.130
This the http service requests that we get so when a the servant works,

00:06:09.130 --> 00:06:09.480
actually,

00:06:09.480 --> 00:06:14.560
is that there's a request and response object HDP certainly risk arrest and actually be

00:06:14.560 --> 00:06:15.560
circular response.

00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.020
And so,

00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:20.850
jsp we don't refer to them by using h two b several requests we've heard to them for using

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.280
request and response.

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.010
And this is it just responds object.

00:06:24.010 --> 00:06:24.450
Well,

00:06:24.450 --> 00:06:28.540
they were gonna react with what we can do with them in a second here we have out as well.

00:06:28.540 --> 00:06:30.220
So you ready to took a look at this is Well,

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:33.730
this is a print writer object used to send output to the client.

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:40.400
So this just puts whatever we put into out into the HTML Coke into the web browser into

00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:41.180
HTML code,

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:43.210
and then we have the session as well.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:49.670
So this is the http session object associated with the request of so age to be sessions

00:06:49.670 --> 00:06:50.200
were actually there.

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.830
Their own sort of separate thing that we can go over.

00:06:52.830 --> 00:06:53.270
But,

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.370
um,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:56.060
essentially is just ah ah,

00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:56.560
little bit of ah,

00:06:56.560 --> 00:06:57.860
more global request.

00:06:57.860 --> 00:06:59.020
So they it sticks around,

00:06:59.020 --> 00:06:59.250
sir.

00:06:59.250 --> 00:07:00.590
Okay.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:03.000
And then we also have application.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:04.490
So this is a servant context,

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.570
object or socio with the application context.

00:07:06.570 --> 00:07:07.690
Just the serval context.

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:08.450
Pre simple stuff.

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:14.750
Confident we have the civil conflict object associated with Paige Paige context.

00:07:14.750 --> 00:07:19.820
This in calculates the use of service specific features like higher performance JSP writers

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:19.820
.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:20.340
Okay,

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:20.440
so,

00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:20.670
again,

00:07:20.670 --> 00:07:24.420
this is all here that on the second page that were essentially covering essentially more,

00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:25.090
you know,

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:27.030
niche stuff.

00:07:27.030 --> 00:07:28.440
So you don't necessarily need to know it,

00:07:28.440 --> 00:07:28.880
but you know it.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.400
Just just know that it exists.

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:31.520
And then later on,

00:07:31.520 --> 00:07:34.320
when you're amore experienced spring developer,

00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.210
you could learn this as well.

00:07:35.210 --> 00:07:35.740
So for now,

00:07:35.740 --> 00:07:37.210
you just need to understand the basics.

00:07:37.210 --> 00:07:38.110
This is yours.

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:41.370
I put I put this year so that you know that it exists and then we have paid to.

00:07:41.370 --> 00:07:45.680
This is a synonym for this and then is used to call the methods defined by the translated

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:48.650
service class so we can call it methods using page.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:50.270
They also have the exception.

00:07:50.270 --> 00:07:54.750
So the exception object allows the exception data to be accessed by designated JSP.

00:07:54.750 --> 00:07:56.540
So all pretty simple stuff again.

00:07:56.540 --> 00:08:00.400
Don't pay that so much to the second page as you should do the first page.

00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:01.450
It's a lot more,

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:01.720
you know,

00:08:01.720 --> 00:08:03.080
used on the first base.

00:08:03.080 --> 00:08:03.730
What's gonna stick?

00:08:03.730 --> 00:08:07.150
Look at what exactly each of these object can do in our JSP file.

00:08:07.150 --> 00:08:08.110
Okay,

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.220
so let start for the very basic cell shows to do.

00:08:10.220 --> 00:08:10.750
Um,

00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:12.750
critics group it here.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:13.930
There we go,

00:08:13.930 --> 00:08:16.550
and we're gonna do out dot print Ellen,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:21.890
and we're just gonna do request dot uh,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.790
let's get which we get.

00:08:23.790 --> 00:08:25.010
Let's get attribute names.

00:08:25.010 --> 00:08:25.370
Actually,

00:08:25.370 --> 00:08:25.530
no,

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:26.000
Let's get,

00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:26.350
uh,

00:08:26.350 --> 00:08:28.380
what should we get?

00:08:28.380 --> 00:08:30.490
Should let's get context path that works.

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.460
Um,

00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:32.090
there we go.

00:08:32.090 --> 00:08:37.500
So let's run this in our browser and the red ghost.

00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.680
We get slash reward a fact,

00:08:38.680 --> 00:08:40.040
which is what we get right here.

00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.060
In this case,

00:08:41.060 --> 00:08:46.090
we don't get get message because it actually that goes to our dispatcher servant.

00:08:46.090 --> 00:08:47.700
So it does it itself,

00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:48.950
and so we don't actually see that.

00:08:48.950 --> 00:08:50.020
Okay,

00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.880
so now we could take a look at response.

00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:54.910
We can also do response.

00:08:54.910 --> 00:08:56.250
Don't,

00:08:56.250 --> 00:08:58.880
uh we're gonna add a cookie.

00:08:58.880 --> 00:08:59.410
Um,

00:08:59.410 --> 00:09:00.550
at a header.

00:09:00.550 --> 00:09:02.240
I do a lot of different stuff.

00:09:02.240 --> 00:09:02.940
Let's do,

00:09:02.940 --> 00:09:05.750
uh what can we do here?

00:09:05.750 --> 00:09:07.200
Get locale?

00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:08.650
Why not?

00:09:08.650 --> 00:09:10.930
Let's to refresh this.

00:09:10.930 --> 00:09:11.450
Ah,

00:09:11.450 --> 00:09:11.640
whoa.

00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:11.960
Pretty,

00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:13.340
I think actually forgot to save it.

00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:13.670
Let's go.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.670
Save it as well.

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:15.170
Um,

00:09:15.170 --> 00:09:17.580
command s they're going out.

00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:17.780
Going.

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:18.310
Koukal.

00:09:18.310 --> 00:09:19.110
Whoops.

00:09:19.110 --> 00:09:19.420
Whoops.

00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:19.690
Nope.

00:09:19.690 --> 00:09:20.100
Nope.

00:09:20.100 --> 00:09:22.180
Clips Google chrome.

00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:22.690
There we go.

00:09:22.690 --> 00:09:24.090
And there we go.

00:09:24.090 --> 00:09:25.970
So we get the locale would since just the language.

00:09:25.970 --> 00:09:27.550
So English states.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:28.740
Okay,

00:09:28.740 --> 00:09:31.640
let's try the session object,

00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.220
Actually.

00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:32.750
Well,

00:09:32.750 --> 00:09:33.130
actually,

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.910
we're already using the out object here,

00:09:35.910 --> 00:09:36.270
so,

00:09:36.270 --> 00:09:36.590
you know,

00:09:36.590 --> 00:09:37.470
that's pretty simple.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:43.430
Let's try this session session dot Uh,

00:09:43.430 --> 00:09:47.360
we can get get creation time that when our session was created,

00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:48.200
in that case,

00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:48.850
it was created.

00:09:48.850 --> 00:09:49.750
It was created.

00:09:49.750 --> 00:09:50.090
This time.

00:09:50.090 --> 00:09:57.760
I think this is actually a long that is the amount of time since amount of seconds

00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.450
direction and I think milliseconds since,

00:10:00.450 --> 00:10:01.460
uh,

00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:02.360
January 1st,

00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.300
1970 since that Essentially house.

00:10:04.300 --> 00:10:07.350
That's essentially how computers work with time.

00:10:07.350 --> 00:10:08.850
Uh,

00:10:08.850 --> 00:10:10.190
in theory,

00:10:10.190 --> 00:10:11.410
maybe we can get,

00:10:11.410 --> 00:10:15.950
um perhaps we can get it in,

00:10:15.950 --> 00:10:16.280
you know,

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.350
more readable format.

00:10:17.350 --> 00:10:17.780
Maybe not,

00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:20.800
though we would have to do it ourselves?

00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:23.050
Um,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:24.520
yeah,

00:10:24.520 --> 00:10:26.470
we would have to We would have to actually do it ourselves.

00:10:26.470 --> 00:10:36.820
So it if we would if we would create an application that would convert the time since 1972

00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:37.730
readable time.

00:10:37.730 --> 00:10:40.010
Then we could read it more better.

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:40.870
But if we can't,

00:10:40.870 --> 00:10:41.390
since it's,

00:10:41.390 --> 00:10:41.650
you know,

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:43.470
in this format.

00:10:43.470 --> 00:10:44.240
But we get the idea.

00:10:44.240 --> 00:10:45.650
This is the idea of the sessions,

00:10:45.650 --> 00:10:46.370
you know,

00:10:46.370 --> 00:10:48.150
Pretty pretty cool stuff,

00:10:48.150 --> 00:10:49.400
okay?

00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:50.780
And yeah,

00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:53.740
essentially it for all the attributes that we sort of,

00:10:53.740 --> 00:10:54.760
they should know.

00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:54.860
Now,

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:57.780
let's take a look at some of the attributes that you know that are still important,

00:10:57.780 --> 00:10:59.810
but not as important as the basic ones.

00:10:59.810 --> 00:11:00.550
All right,

00:11:00.550 --> 00:11:01.180
so really quickly here.

00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:03.450
So we can just do application,

00:11:03.450 --> 00:11:06.160
okay?

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:07.730
And we can do a lot of things here,

00:11:07.730 --> 00:11:08.920
So let's try to get,

00:11:08.920 --> 00:11:09.440
um,

00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.400
context path.

00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:12.500
Might as well,

00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.550
let's see in Google chrome,

00:11:14.550 --> 00:11:15.990
There we go.

00:11:15.990 --> 00:11:18.450
We get where border facts actually pretty much the same exact thing.

00:11:18.450 --> 00:11:19.470
Um,

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:20.900
as when we do it with a crest,

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:28.700
we can also do dot get Let's get It's weird how it doesn't sometimes.

00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.910
Let me see.

00:11:29.910 --> 00:11:30.300
What is that?

00:11:30.300 --> 00:11:36.850
What exactly methods there are doing to the hint.

00:11:36.850 --> 00:11:38.320
There we go.

00:11:38.320 --> 00:11:39.070
Get,

00:11:39.070 --> 00:11:39.770
um,

00:11:39.770 --> 00:11:43.610
Let's try,

00:11:43.610 --> 00:11:49.550
but you get server intro.

00:11:49.550 --> 00:11:50.490
That's always fun.

00:11:50.490 --> 00:11:51.470
Uh,

00:11:51.470 --> 00:11:52.410
let's refresh.

00:11:52.410 --> 00:11:53.000
There we go.

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000
I bet you Tomcat version nine.

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:55.730
There we go.

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:57.950
That's the server that we that we did.

00:11:57.950 --> 00:11:58.830
And,

00:11:58.830 --> 00:11:59.120
yeah,

00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:01.270
this is really the application.

00:12:01.270 --> 00:12:02.660
Objects else.

00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.730
Take a look at a a conflict object,

00:12:06.730 --> 00:12:07.680
so we can do,

00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:09.350
um,

00:12:09.350 --> 00:12:15.880
config dot get we get the circle context.

00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:17.910
Let's get servant Name might as well.

00:12:17.910 --> 00:12:18.400
Um,

00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:19.350
we'll see what that does.

00:12:19.350 --> 00:12:21.200
There you go.

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.050
We get a jsp.

00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:22.800
Certainly name.

00:12:22.800 --> 00:12:29.460
We can also get the don't get it's con fig,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:33.670
not get Serve it,

00:12:33.670 --> 00:12:34.350
I think.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:37.390
Nope.

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:37.850
Nope.

00:12:37.850 --> 00:12:43.670
There we go sort of context.

00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.070
And then from server context,

00:12:46.070 --> 00:12:46.850
we can get,

00:12:46.850 --> 00:12:48.770
uh,

00:12:48.770 --> 00:12:49.070
we have,

00:12:49.070 --> 00:12:49.510
for example,

00:12:49.510 --> 00:12:50.550
the context path.

00:12:50.550 --> 00:12:51.850
There's a lot of things we can do here.

00:12:51.850 --> 00:12:58.540
Let's get jsp conference descriptor from which we should get.

00:12:58.540 --> 00:13:05.640
Um um what else could we used to do to string here?

00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.750
Since I don't want to have a mess of different methods here,

00:13:08.750 --> 00:13:10.290
and let's refresh,

00:13:10.290 --> 00:13:10.910
there we go.

00:13:10.910 --> 00:13:13.550
We actually get where to get air that this is what an era look like.

00:13:13.550 --> 00:13:14.540
Yeah.

00:13:14.540 --> 00:13:14.840
Okay,

00:13:14.840 --> 00:13:15.340
so this case,

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:20.290
the error is because we got no point or exceptions is we don't have a sort of context in

00:13:20.290 --> 00:13:21.920
this case created,

00:13:21.920 --> 00:13:22.320
but,

00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:22.650
you know,

00:13:22.650 --> 00:13:27.560
you can get the circle context really wanted to or actually notes.

00:13:27.560 --> 00:13:30.500
It's because of the JSP conflict.

00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:31.440
Descriptor.

00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:34.000
That's what isn't actually created.

00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:34.980
So yeah.

00:13:34.980 --> 00:13:35.390
Okay.

00:13:35.390 --> 00:13:35.810
Anyway,

00:13:35.810 --> 00:13:36.410
um,

00:13:36.410 --> 00:13:40.530
let's take a look now at page context.

00:13:40.530 --> 00:13:41.180
All right,

00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:42.950
let's delete this here.

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.970
Okay,

00:13:44.970 --> 00:13:52.150
lets dio out dot print Ellen page context.

00:13:52.150 --> 00:13:54.470
I'm not gonna,

00:13:54.470 --> 00:13:54.720
you know,

00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.440
dive into exactly what we can do with it.

00:13:56.440 --> 00:13:58.080
Since it is a little bit more advanced,

00:13:58.080 --> 00:13:59.750
we're gonna share that it exists.

00:13:59.750 --> 00:14:01.200
Ah.

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.270
What do you see The problem?

00:14:02.270 --> 00:14:05.680
I did answer that.

00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:05.880
Yeah.

00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:06.270
There we go.

00:14:06.270 --> 00:14:06.500
All right,

00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:10.440
let's go to Chrome and Refresh.

00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:10.860
And there we go.

00:14:10.860 --> 00:14:11.840
So we have Ah,

00:14:11.840 --> 00:14:13.310
our page context.

00:14:13.310 --> 00:14:13.970
Implementation.

00:14:13.970 --> 00:14:14.070
So,

00:14:14.070 --> 00:14:14.270
again,

00:14:14.270 --> 00:14:16.780
this is actually a thing that's a little bit more advanced.

00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:18.900
I'm not gonna go over too much of this time,

00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:19.590
but then,

00:14:19.590 --> 00:14:21.770
um maybe in a future quarters,

00:14:21.770 --> 00:14:22.040
I'm like,

00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:27.600
that will cover page context essentially for its used mainly for optimization speed

00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.550
speeding stuff up.

00:14:28.550 --> 00:14:29.590
Okay,

00:14:29.590 --> 00:14:31.940
so it's gonna actually take a look at the page.

00:14:31.940 --> 00:14:32.550
Variable.

00:14:32.550 --> 00:14:34.210
All right,

00:14:34.210 --> 00:14:38.620
so for page weaken dio page dot um,

00:14:38.620 --> 00:14:40.860
there's due to strength if there really isn't much,

00:14:40.860 --> 00:14:43.790
we can do with it in our browser.

00:14:43.790 --> 00:14:48.380
Now we get Web web INF view.

00:14:48.380 --> 00:14:49.250
There we go.

00:14:49.250 --> 00:14:51.520
View Underscore J spaces.

00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.610
Just page that we are sort of OK,

00:14:54.610 --> 00:14:56.820
so we're not going to take a look at the exception class either,

00:14:56.820 --> 00:14:57.220
since you know,

00:14:57.220 --> 00:14:58.340
it's it's just a whole big,

00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.540
big deal.

00:14:59.540 --> 00:15:02.170
Sort of the rep takeover eso then seriously,

00:15:02.170 --> 00:15:02.730
all the engine.

00:15:02.730 --> 00:15:02.970
Oh,

00:15:02.970 --> 00:15:03.780
don't pay them.

00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:06.710
Just in these last four objects that we went over,

00:15:06.710 --> 00:15:09.170
I just needed to hear that they exist,

00:15:09.170 --> 00:15:12.920
Sort of showing you getting what they do and how they work again.

00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:16.070
It would turn into a J speak horse instead of,

00:15:16.070 --> 00:15:16.330
ah,

00:15:16.330 --> 00:15:17.390
spring course.

00:15:17.390 --> 00:15:17.450
Oh,

00:15:17.450 --> 00:15:17.650
yeah.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.530
Anyway,

00:15:18.530 --> 00:15:19.000
um,

00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.980
that's it for the part two of this lesson.

00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:23.000
Now for without further ado,

00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:23.950
let's assign you Homer.

00:15:23.950 --> 00:15:25.540
Okay,

00:15:25.540 --> 00:15:29.630
So from work is pretty pretty simple to just created jsp view that will say whether a

00:15:29.630 --> 00:15:31.660
certain model attribute is odd arrangements.

00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:33.060
You're gonna pass something into the model,

00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:33.550
you know,

00:15:33.550 --> 00:15:39.670
just some number and you're going to write inside the JSP view whether it's odd or even

00:15:39.670 --> 00:15:42.390
pretty simple stuff you can use the ah script led to do it,

00:15:42.390 --> 00:15:44.360
or you can just do it using the C tag library.

00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:45.250
However you want.

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:48.570
I driven when you just do it using a script lit and then you combine that with HTML.

00:15:48.570 --> 00:15:49.000
Since that,

00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:49.230
you know,

00:15:49.230 --> 00:15:50.000
just is a little bit,

00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:50.460
um,

00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.170
simpler than using,

00:15:52.170 --> 00:15:53.450
uh,

00:15:53.450 --> 00:15:55.120
the seat down library.

00:15:55.120 --> 00:15:55.590
So yeah.

00:15:55.590 --> 00:15:56.150
Anyway,

00:15:56.150 --> 00:15:56.740
um,

00:15:56.740 --> 00:15:58.770
sees also called J Steel attack Weber as well,

00:15:58.770 --> 00:15:59.450
so just know that.

00:15:59.450 --> 00:16:00.140
Okay,

00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:00.350
So now,

00:16:00.350 --> 00:16:01.390
without further Dio,

00:16:01.390 --> 00:16:01.880
I wish Look,

00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:02.290
with homework,

00:16:02.290 --> 00:16:03.640
there really nothing too difficult here,

00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.010
Essentially,

00:16:04.010 --> 00:16:05.560
just doing a script lit with HTML.

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:05.890
You know,

00:16:05.890 --> 00:16:08.940
if the numbers are we do something else and then for its even with that,

00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:09.500
I don't think so.

00:16:09.500 --> 00:16:09.640
Yeah,

00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:12.240
pretty much nothing complex here and yeah,

00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.480
So that further doing,

00:16:13.480 --> 00:16:14.490
I wish you luck.

00:16:14.490 --> 00:16:14.810
And,

00:16:14.810 --> 00:16:15.050
uh,

00:16:15.050 --> 00:16:15.820
also next time
