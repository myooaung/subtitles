00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.200
in this video,

00:00:01.200 --> 00:00:04.690
we're going to take a look at some of the things that you would need before we start

00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:05.850
working with Have been it,

00:00:05.850 --> 00:00:09.710
the first of which is Jessica or Java Development Kit.

00:00:09.710 --> 00:00:13.660
If you're able to write Java programs and run them comfortably,

00:00:13.660 --> 00:00:14.710
then that means you,

00:00:14.710 --> 00:00:17.260
although they have this installed in your computer.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.740
What you need to make sure,

00:00:18.740 --> 00:00:19.330
though,

00:00:19.330 --> 00:00:21.650
is that you have the latest one installed,

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.780
and I believe since your enthusiastic about learning have been it,

00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:30.800
I assume that you know how to install J decay or upgrade to latest wash in.

00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.590
Then,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:32.780
once you have the set,

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.850
make sure that you have a database management system software installed in your computer.

00:00:37.850 --> 00:00:41.150
I'm going to be using posed re SQL software.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:46.440
It is one of the most popular databases used along with job applications,

00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:48.930
and if you want to fall along with me,

00:00:48.930 --> 00:00:51.080
you can install the same database,

00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:53.570
or if you're comfortable with any other data base,

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:55.700
you can use them as well.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.080
In this course,

00:00:57.080 --> 00:01:00.450
we're not really focused on database specific concept.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:01.210
Rather,

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:05.120
we would interact with hibernate and having it is actually going to take care of

00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:06.630
interacting with the database.

00:01:06.630 --> 00:01:08.150
And that's the beauty of Harbin.

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.410
It we developers don't have to interact with the database,

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:15.950
but we would rather interact with hibernate and have been it will do the job for us.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:17.360
So for this course,

00:01:17.360 --> 00:01:19.350
it doesn't matter what database you use,

00:01:19.350 --> 00:01:25.100
but you need to make sure that you have some evidence off how database works.

00:01:25.100 --> 00:01:27.300
Some of the basic SQL queries,

00:01:27.300 --> 00:01:27.870
you know,

00:01:27.870 --> 00:01:29.130
joins etcetera.

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.380
That would be a great value add,

00:01:31.380 --> 00:01:33.300
and also you need to be aware off.

00:01:33.300 --> 00:01:34.500
Some of the basic queries,

00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:35.890
like creating a database,

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:40.250
are using the connection parameters to connect to the database etcetera,

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:44.150
because these are the stuff that we're going to differ from Dera Bester database.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:47.870
So we just need to know those basics like connection battle meters,

00:01:47.870 --> 00:01:49.840
being able to create a database,

00:01:49.840 --> 00:01:54.390
using a command land or some kind of an administrator tool that is specific to your

00:01:54.390 --> 00:01:54.960
database,

00:01:54.960 --> 00:01:55.650
etcetera.

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.380
And that puts suffice.

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:02.170
And the next thing that I want to make sure is that you have an I D set up integrated

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.370
development enrollment,

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:05.450
something like a clips on that beans.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:05.970
Now,

00:02:05.970 --> 00:02:08.350
if you've been working with real World Java projects,

00:02:08.350 --> 00:02:10.410
then you probably know how to use Eclipse.

00:02:10.410 --> 00:02:15.800
And if you're not very familiar with the clips and you know how to use net beans or any

00:02:15.800 --> 00:02:16.550
other I D,

00:02:16.550 --> 00:02:21.530
then I would recommend you to switch to reckless because it is the most popular idea out

00:02:21.530 --> 00:02:22.050
there.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:25.450
And it has a lot of features that no other idea can support.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:26.370
If not,

00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:26.750
no,

00:02:26.750 --> 00:02:29.020
at least at little point of time,

00:02:29.020 --> 00:02:32.180
you'll be forced to switch to eclipse I d.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:33.850
Because it's a wonderful tool.

00:02:33.850 --> 00:02:35.000
And let me tell you,

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.870
no matter what idea that to use,

00:02:36.870 --> 00:02:40.870
they also the same purpose off easing your development process.

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.550
So even if you're using an idea like Net beans,

00:02:43.550 --> 00:02:49.750
it should be a very easy switch for you to download and install Eclipse and start using it

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:49.750
.

00:02:49.750 --> 00:02:53.890
And this is the tool that I'm going to use throughout this course.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:55.410
So if you want to fall along,

00:02:55.410 --> 00:02:56.560
install eclipse.

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:57.550
It's pretty easy.

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:01.530
And once you install it just to make sure everything is working,

00:03:01.530 --> 00:03:02.070
okay,

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:06.640
just create a sample Java project with the sample hello world application and then try to

00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:07.130
run it,

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.570
make sure it is working,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:14.870
and finally you would need the habit framework and the list off other related libraries.

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:16.270
It's a lot of pain,

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:17.480
too manually.

00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:21.090
Don't let all these libraries and and set up the enrollment.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:26.100
So what I'm going to do is I'm going to use a project management tool like Maven.

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:31.610
Maven is the most project management tool out there to help you manage the dependencies,

00:03:31.610 --> 00:03:32.350
etcetera.

00:03:32.350 --> 00:03:35.200
This will make our job a lot easier.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:37.250
If you're not ever off maven,

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:41.700
you can still fall along and even work with the examples that I'm going to walk it through

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:41.700
.

00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:42.430
Or,

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:43.110
alternatively,

00:03:43.110 --> 00:03:44.890
I have a great course on the same.

00:03:44.890 --> 00:03:49.380
Just drop me a message and I'll see if I can give you access to that course.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:50.680
And similarly,

00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:53.100
I have a course on post three sq as well.

00:03:53.100 --> 00:03:54.710
It's a wonderful course,

00:03:54.710 --> 00:03:55.840
and that course,

00:03:55.840 --> 00:03:59.050
not only talks about was great skill specifically,

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:02.960
but also it talks about PG admin,

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:06.400
SQL in general and Jerry BC,

00:04:06.400 --> 00:04:08.530
along with the mini project,

00:04:08.530 --> 00:04:10.950
which is basically a crowd application.

00:04:10.950 --> 00:04:13.010
If you need access to that course,

00:04:13.010 --> 00:04:14.250
drop me a message.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:16.060
Let me see what we can do.

00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.060
All right.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:18.850
Once you have everything in place,

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.830
I'm going to demonstrate the last step,

00:04:20.830 --> 00:04:21.260
though.

00:04:21.260 --> 00:04:26.050
But just make sure that you have all these three set up and installed and make sure they

00:04:26.050 --> 00:04:26.950
are working.

00:04:26.950 --> 00:04:27.850
All right,

00:04:27.850 --> 00:04:28.460
See you soon.
