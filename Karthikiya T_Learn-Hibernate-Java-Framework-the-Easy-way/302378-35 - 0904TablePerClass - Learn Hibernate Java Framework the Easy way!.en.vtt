00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.250
we have one more inheritance type to cover and that is stable per class.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:10.630
Just as the name suggests there's going to be a table associated with each and every class

00:00:10.630 --> 00:00:11.730
in the hierarchy,

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:13.380
and in addition to that,

00:00:13.380 --> 00:00:17.250
each and every table is going to be independent off each other.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:22.330
That means there won't be any kind of relation between these tables with a foreign key or

00:00:22.330 --> 00:00:23.350
anything of that sort.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.550
Every table will have all the columns.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:30.120
The person table will have the columns for all these fields,

00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:37.380
like I d name and age and the employee table will have the column boss name and also the

00:00:37.380 --> 00:00:41.480
columns that it inherits from its parent person class.

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:45.910
So the employee table will have these columns in here,

00:00:45.910 --> 00:00:48.730
including the identify Air has.

00:00:48.730 --> 00:00:49.410
Alas,

00:00:49.410 --> 00:00:53.370
this same is the case with the Child Flats boss.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:56.970
The boss table would have all the fields off,

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:03.820
parent and and also the properties that are part off the boss class.

00:01:03.820 --> 00:01:16.170
It's as simple as that that's on the program and see how things will work and go to the

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:17.050
database.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.450
So its star from Boss,

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:29.450
our first let's take a look at person table So you have personality those fields.

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:36.420
The boss table will not only have fields in the boss class,

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.810
but also the fear is that it has inherited,

00:01:39.810 --> 00:01:41.850
including the identify air.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:46.250
And same is the case with employees as well.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:48.250
As simple as that.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.650
And when you're trying to retrieve,

00:01:50.650 --> 00:01:55.380
are getting object from the database like we did here,

00:01:55.380 --> 00:02:01.620
it's actually going to simply use the select query on the particular table.

00:02:01.620 --> 00:02:03.850
If you're trying to retrieve person object,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.950
then select Query is going to be on the person object.

00:02:06.950 --> 00:02:09.950
No joint operation or anything of that sort.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.450
It's pretty straightforward.

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.770
All right,

00:02:15.770 --> 00:02:16.900
that's it on this video.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.590
See you soon.
