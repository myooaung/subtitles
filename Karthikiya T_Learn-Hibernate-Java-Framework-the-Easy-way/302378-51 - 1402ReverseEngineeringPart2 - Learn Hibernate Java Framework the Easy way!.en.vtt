00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
So once you have everything ready,

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:06.530
all you have to do is to hit this icon that is combination of Harbin,

00:00:06.530 --> 00:00:08.700
it icon and the play icon.

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:13.030
This icon will be visible only when you're inhabited prospective.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:18.580
So hit this down arrow button that that is next to that icon and kills this option.

00:00:18.580 --> 00:00:20.950
Happen it cogeneration configurations.

00:00:20.950 --> 00:00:23.640
And in here you may not see anything,

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:24.980
so you have to create one.

00:00:24.980 --> 00:00:32.630
So you just right click on this happen It called Generation hit on new configuration and

00:00:32.630 --> 00:00:35.960
here he would choose the conflagration that we had previously set.

00:00:35.960 --> 00:00:38.550
So let's choose that.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:44.370
And you would provide the or poor directory where the generator entities would be stored So

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:44.900
you would hit,

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.760
browse and choose the directory.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:49.450
In my case,

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:57.800
I want to keep it inside this directory hit,

00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.460
okay,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:05.720
And let's enable this option to enable the reverse engineering from database connection.

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:08.090
You would provide the package name in here,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:13.450
and I'm going to simply provide the package name.

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:18.350
So it's com dot company dot hatch beep Raj.

00:01:18.350 --> 00:01:22.000
This is the package that I'm using across the project.

00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.110
Once you do that,

00:01:23.110 --> 00:01:26.650
you would basically select what are all the things that you want export.

00:01:26.650 --> 00:01:28.010
In my case,

00:01:28.010 --> 00:01:30.600
I want to choose this option domain code,

00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:33.410
which essentially means entities,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:34.930
and along with that,

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:38.350
I also want to generate have been it XML map ing's.

00:01:38.350 --> 00:01:39.880
And if you want to gender it,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:41.500
annotations for your entities,

00:01:41.500 --> 00:01:43.740
then you can check this option.

00:01:43.740 --> 00:01:45.030
Additionally,

00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:47.470
you can also choose these other options available.

00:01:47.470 --> 00:01:48.620
For example,

00:01:48.620 --> 00:01:49.710
if you enable this,

00:01:49.710 --> 00:01:52.470
this tool will generate the Dow object.

00:01:52.470 --> 00:01:53.110
Well,

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:53.750
at the moment,

00:01:53.750 --> 00:01:55.110
we're not really looking to gender,

00:01:55.110 --> 00:01:55.630
dad.

00:01:55.630 --> 00:01:59.050
So for now we're going to leave rest of the stuff as it is,

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:03.930
and we just wanted to select these two options it apply,

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:06.150
so that would save all the details.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.700
And that's all there is to it.

00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:11.090
All you have to do now is it run?

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:23.260
It's going to take a second or two or maybe a little more So we're done.

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:28.440
So let's switch to our job our perspective And sure enough,

00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:30.860
we now have those two ended its populated.

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.960
Let's take a look at what's inside them,

00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:39.250
so we have everything like a normal po Joe.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:43.610
But where is the relation one too many relation?

00:02:43.610 --> 00:02:44.510
Well,

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.050
it is taken care as well if you go to these files.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:58.910
So the boss mapping file has defined a set which would constitute a set off employees.

00:02:58.910 --> 00:03:01.900
And even it has taken care off,

00:03:01.900 --> 00:03:06.350
defining one too many relation with the entity employees.

00:03:06.350 --> 00:03:11.650
And in the employee mapping file,

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.490
we have many to one mapping.

00:03:14.490 --> 00:03:17.750
So this is bidirectional mapping from both the ends.

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:22.650
Let's take a look at some of the errors we have in the test or Java,

00:03:22.650 --> 00:03:30.650
so basically we don't have a constructor that just takes in one perimeter.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:33.800
So let's try to add that constructor in the entity.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:41.370
And this is going to be the name of the employees,

00:03:41.370 --> 00:03:44.980
just simple as that,

00:03:44.980 --> 00:03:52.150
and similarly went to fix the boss into the as well.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:04:09.690
So let's create a new constructor in there So string boss name his age and set off

00:04:09.690 --> 00:04:10.650
employees.

00:04:10.650 --> 00:04:12.450
So let's try to,

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:19.150
I mean just copies and biz them in here.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:24.050
We have a new constructor and this should fix issue,

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:27.060
so that's all there is to it.

00:04:27.060 --> 00:04:29.190
So isn't that beautiful?

00:04:29.190 --> 00:04:31.450
But before you run the program,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.950
since we're using XML conflict files,

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:40.250
where to make sure that we have these two file specified in the Harbin It convict file or

00:04:40.250 --> 00:04:44.750
no case pose Greek symbol file that is under the resources.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:52.340
So let us add those two mapping files in here.

00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:53.720
Let me just visible this,

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:54.070
too,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:05:01.680
and we will add the mapping XML file.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:07.610
It's as simple as that is going to be boss.

00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:14.550
And also we need to take her off the same in our main logic as well.

00:05:14.550 --> 00:05:17.430
But let me just quickly come in dark.

00:05:17.430 --> 00:05:22.170
All these we're not really interested in performing crowd operations.

00:05:22.170 --> 00:05:27.780
We just want to see if things are working after we did reverse engineering.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:30.570
So instead of vanity,

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:53.650
that class this is going to be hand add class and same goes here as well.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:59.820
And before we run the program,

00:05:59.820 --> 00:06:04.950
that has also changed the confident here and made this validate.

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:11.170
So this will ensure that the entities in our application and the database tables can be

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:12.250
mapped to each other.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:17.770
It's on the program and see how it goes.

00:06:17.770 --> 00:06:20.340
All right,

00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:21.070
let me stop it.

00:06:21.070 --> 00:06:27.400
I guess we already have an entity with the particular identify air.

00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:28.160
Nope,

00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.570
I guess it's auto generated.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:31.050
It's on the program.

00:06:31.050 --> 00:06:38.650
And sure enough,

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.550
things worked really well.

00:06:40.550 --> 00:06:42.690
And if you go to the database,

00:06:42.690 --> 00:06:48.550
it would see a new boss entry being populated.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:55.520
If you're on the program again,

00:06:55.520 --> 00:06:56.160
you missy,

00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:57.100
an exception.

00:06:57.100 --> 00:07:01.650
That's because I believe there's going to be a conflict.

00:07:01.650 --> 00:07:03.480
And sure enough,

00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:05.380
we do have a conflict.

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:10.000
So it says,

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.910
double get key while the while its unique constraint boss.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.190
Primary key.

00:07:16.190 --> 00:07:18.760
So it needs to be taken care.

00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.930
But you got the point.

00:07:19.930 --> 00:07:24.320
We're able to do the reverse engineering and things are working well,

00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.150
if you want me to fix that,

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:33.450
so to fix issue,

00:07:33.450 --> 00:07:36.950
let us change this to increment.

00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:40.450
Let's get the word correct.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:46.550
And now let's run the program and save things would be fixed.

00:07:46.550 --> 00:07:48.530
Well,

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:49.250
sure enough,

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:52.450
I think it's working really well.

00:07:52.450 --> 00:07:57.720
And if you go to the database,

00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:00.250
we do have multiple interests.

00:08:00.250 --> 00:08:02.800
All right,

00:08:02.800 --> 00:08:03.780
that's about it.

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.350
See,

00:08:05.350 --> 00:08:05.950
you assume
