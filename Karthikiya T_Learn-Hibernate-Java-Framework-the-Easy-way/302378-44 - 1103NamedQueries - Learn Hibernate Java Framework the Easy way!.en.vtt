00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.620
and the sweetie we're going to talk about named queries.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.680
Let us say that you have the following hatch kill statement,

00:00:10.680 --> 00:00:14.550
which would help you fish the employee with a particular name.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:20.720
Let us also assume that you're going to use the sexual statement across hundreds of

00:00:20.720 --> 00:00:22.750
locations in your application logic.

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:29.710
Then you would likely face a lot off problems because if you were to make any changes to

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:30.450
this query,

00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:37.460
then it would have to reflect across all the locations and the sad part off it is there is

00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:38.720
no syntax highlighting.

00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.120
If you forget to change in one location,

00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:45.400
then you're going to face some inconsistencies with your application behavior.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:47.270
And as a by product,

00:00:47.270 --> 00:00:51.850
there's a high possibility off getting run time errors as well.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:56.050
It can easily miss up with the syntax off the Hatch Girl statement,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:57.910
and in addition to that,

00:00:57.910 --> 00:01:03.630
there's a lot of physical effort involved to incorporate the same changes across all the

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:05.260
locations and is,

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:05.950
of course,

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:07.630
a terrible waste off time.

00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.850
The solution is named queries,

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:16.580
so essentially what we're going to do is we're going to give a unique name to this query,

00:01:16.580 --> 00:01:19.150
and then we call it and named Cleary.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:20.950
And from that bind,

00:01:20.950 --> 00:01:23.200
wherever you're using this query,

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:29.210
you can just use its identify air or its name instead of writing the entire query,

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:32.290
and then you'll get rid off all these problems.

00:01:32.290 --> 00:01:33.090
Now,

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:35.790
this is something similar to using a variable.

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:36.840
For example,

00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:41.470
say that you have a very blacks and it holds a particular number.

00:01:41.470 --> 00:01:47.240
Now insert off writing the entire number beverages needed.

00:01:47.240 --> 00:01:52.080
You just simply going to use this variable everywhere in your application.

00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.700
So that would essentially solve a lot of problems like this.

00:01:55.700 --> 00:02:00.650
Same is the case with a named query from this Take a look at how it's done.

00:02:00.650 --> 00:02:08.970
So here we have the employees Poggio or the Persistent Class and on top off it.

00:02:08.970 --> 00:02:12.750
Since this named clearly belongs to the employee entity,

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.710
I have defined the named Cleary in the same class,

00:02:16.710 --> 00:02:19.150
and it is how you would define it.

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:22.600
Isn't these annotations task simple as that,

00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:30.880
and the sanitation expects you to do this too obvious para meters One is the query itself

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:34.220
and the name that you want to give to that query.

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:40.590
So here we have this query and we're trying to select the employees based on a particular

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.050
name.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:42.250
Now,

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:47.920
when you use this colon in here that will allow us to do so called a placeholder.

00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:54.140
That means whatever is written in here can be replaced at later point off time from our

00:02:54.140 --> 00:02:54.660
court.

00:02:54.660 --> 00:02:57.170
And we're going to take a look at an example in a second.

00:02:57.170 --> 00:03:00.350
So here is how you would define the named query.

00:03:00.350 --> 00:03:02.270
And once you do so,

00:03:02.270 --> 00:03:10.080
you can access that named query by saying session don't get named Cleary and you just

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.050
simply passing that name.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:18.250
So this would fetch this query from here.

00:03:18.250 --> 00:03:24.390
And once you do so you can set the perimeter.

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.380
In our case,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.980
we have one place holder which needs to be replaced,

00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:32.240
and you're going to replace by using this method,

00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:33.690
said Para Meter,

00:03:33.690 --> 00:03:38.150
You would specify the name off the placeholder,

00:03:38.150 --> 00:03:40.550
and he would give you a value.

00:03:40.550 --> 00:03:42.240
So in our case,

00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:45.600
we're trying to fetch the employee with the name E M.

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.690
P X four and we'll see the result.

00:03:49.690 --> 00:03:54.210
And here it is,

00:03:54.210 --> 00:03:56.350
but it's simple and straightforward.

00:03:56.350 --> 00:03:57.720
All right,

00:03:57.720 --> 00:03:58.470
see you soon.
