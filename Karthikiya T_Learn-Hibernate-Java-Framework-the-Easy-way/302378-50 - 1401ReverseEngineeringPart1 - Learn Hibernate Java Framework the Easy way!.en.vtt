00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.230
in this video,

00:00:01.230 --> 00:00:06.460
we're going to talk about reverse engineering so far in our examples,

00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:07.360
we were auto,

00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.330
creating the tables in the database,

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.950
pissed on the entities present in our project.

00:00:11.950 --> 00:00:15.350
But sometimes you might want to do it the other way.

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.280
I mean,

00:00:16.280 --> 00:00:19.520
you may have a database with some tables in it,

00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:23.150
and you wanted to generate entities for each off the table.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.070
This is often the case,

00:00:25.070 --> 00:00:27.670
especially for using a legacy technology.

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:30.250
And now you wanted to switch to an Orem tool.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:31.120
For example,

00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:37.180
say that you have an application which is using JBC to perform database transactions,

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:40.110
and now you have decided to switch to hibernate.

00:00:40.110 --> 00:00:44.970
It becomes very tedious job to write entities for each and every table present in your

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:45.710
database.

00:00:45.710 --> 00:00:46.650
Instead,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:50.740
it would be a lot better if you use an existing tool that will.

00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:51.800
So the purpose.

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:55.210
That way your code would be less error prone,

00:00:55.210 --> 00:00:59.010
and you don't have to spend too much time in trying to switch to happen.

00:00:59.010 --> 00:00:59.380
Eight.

00:00:59.380 --> 00:01:02.120
So let us take a look at how it's done.

00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:06.020
So what 1/2 Here is one too many examples that we had talked about,

00:01:06.020 --> 00:01:14.880
and I'm just simply going to extract it in the folder and then imported in our eclipse.

00:01:14.880 --> 00:01:18.180
And Roman has a maven project.

00:01:18.180 --> 00:01:34.460
All right.

00:01:34.460 --> 00:01:34.640
Now,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:43.140
let me just quickly run the program just so that there will be some data populated in the

00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:43.950
database.

00:01:43.950 --> 00:02:00.220
And if you go to the database,

00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:05.950
we have put this tables populated.

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:07.680
Now let me do something.

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:12.550
Let me just delete these two entities from here.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:16.000
Now,

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.310
imagine that I'm using very busy in our application,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:20.170
which is a legacy technology.

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:21.290
And now,

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.110
since I'm switching tohave anade,

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:26.060
I wanted to order generate the entities.

00:02:26.060 --> 00:02:32.210
So before we try to generate it when it install some of the tools required to do this job.

00:02:32.210 --> 00:02:36.890
So I go to help and then eclipse marketplace.

00:02:36.890 --> 00:02:43.950
The tool that I'm going to install is with the name J Barstools.

00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:45.610
As part of J.

00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:49.990
Barstools will also have a tool which is meant for have been eight.

00:02:49.990 --> 00:03:10.310
Let me search for it in here and here.

00:03:10.310 --> 00:03:17.880
It iss let me just install it now.

00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:19.670
Whatever the promise that you get,

00:03:19.670 --> 00:03:21.450
just keep accepting them.

00:03:21.450 --> 00:03:28.750
It's going to take a bit off a time here.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:30.950
Let me pause the video and get back.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:36.250
Let's confirm it.

00:03:36.250 --> 00:03:44.050
Let's accept the license agreement had finished.

00:03:44.050 --> 00:03:47.810
When you get a prompt like this,

00:03:47.810 --> 00:03:50.350
just say install anyway.

00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:51.630
Now,

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:52.230
in this problem,

00:03:52.230 --> 00:03:54.550
just select all and accept.

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:02.500
Let's restock the eclipse.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.290
Okay,

00:04:05.290 --> 00:04:05.870
here we are.

00:04:05.870 --> 00:04:07.450
Off track lips Country started.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:16.400
Now what we need to do is to switch to the database perspective and create the connection.

00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:17.870
So let's see how it's done.

00:04:17.870 --> 00:04:22.990
You goto window and then prospect to opened,

00:04:22.990 --> 00:04:28.160
respect to and choose other and in the list,

00:04:28.160 --> 00:04:32.580
you should be able to find database development hit open.

00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:36.440
Since I've already configured the connection ones,

00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.080
it's shown up in here,

00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:39.250
but in your case,

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:40.470
you need to create one.

00:04:40.470 --> 00:04:47.020
So you just simply select the state of his connections and then right click hit new search

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.080
for your database.

00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.000
In my case,

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.350
it's supposed grass cure,

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:53.350
so I would choose that hit next.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:59.410
And here you're just provide all the connection para meters to help connect to the database

00:04:59.410 --> 00:04:59.410
,

00:04:59.410 --> 00:05:03.910
and then you click Finish.

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:05.300
It's as simple as that,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:06.850
but before you hit finish,

00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:11.700
just try to test the connection and make sure you get this message being succeeded.

00:05:11.700 --> 00:05:13.570
If you see an error message.

00:05:13.570 --> 00:05:17.020
Then you might be doing something wrong in here.

00:05:17.020 --> 00:05:19.550
Just make sure all the connection Bad image Also correct.

00:05:19.550 --> 00:05:23.000
Now,

00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.390
once we have it working,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.020
we need to switch to a have a net prospect to.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:35.770
So I goto window prospect to and then I search for have been eight and hair It is the habit

00:05:35.770 --> 00:05:40.450
Prospective wouldn't have been appearing if you have not installed two barstools.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:44.960
So once is like that hit open here.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.770
We need to add so called cabinet configuration and is based on the harbinger maximal

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:51.450
document we have in our project.

00:05:51.450 --> 00:05:55.480
So since I've already configured it has shown up in here.

00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:56.720
But in your case,

00:05:56.720 --> 00:06:03.050
you need to hit this place icon and then he had to choose your project.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:06.250
So let's choose our project and hit OK.

00:06:06.250 --> 00:06:15.410
And we chose the annotations option in here Now,

00:06:15.410 --> 00:06:18.620
Unit data point to the properties file which will be happening,

00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:20.670
or properties are they have been it.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:21.080
Come,

00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:21.680
pick file.

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:27.250
So we hit set up In case if you don't have an existing conflict file,

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:29.070
then you can create one,

00:06:29.070 --> 00:06:34.970
and you can just simply say very want to store that conflict file.

00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:37.790
I mean in which folder it next.

00:06:37.790 --> 00:06:43.450
And then you can just populate all the dead of ex convicts stuff.

00:06:43.450 --> 00:06:51.600
So once you populate all these and hit finish have been it will create the conflict trial

00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:53.560
for you in the project.

00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:54.640
But in my case,

00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:56.820
the convict pile is already present.

00:06:56.820 --> 00:06:59.820
So I'm just going to pick the existing one.

00:06:59.820 --> 00:07:05.770
So I say use existing and then I chose this file.

00:07:05.770 --> 00:07:07.870
So once you do that hit,

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.850
apply and hit OK,

00:07:09.850 --> 00:07:12.650
that would add or configuration in here.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:14.160
So until this point,

00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:19.270
we have everything to do the reverse engineering and will continue from next radio.
