00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.030
in this video,

00:00:01.030 --> 00:00:06.060
we're going to talk about inheritance type joined when you said the inheritance type of

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:12.010
joined have been it will actually create a table for each and every entity in the hierarchy

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:12.010
.

00:00:12.010 --> 00:00:15.150
So in here we have these three classes.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:19.770
A couple of them are the child classes off the person class.

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:26.070
And so having it will create three tables that corresponds to each one of these classes.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:28.970
And in addition to that have been.

00:00:28.970 --> 00:00:33.650
It will also create a primary key for the child classes.

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:40.940
And that primary key is actually populated with the primary kiss off the person class or

00:00:40.940 --> 00:00:41.990
dependent class,

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:48.160
meaning that the primary key off these two tables is actually the foreign key.

00:00:48.160 --> 00:00:51.650
That points to the primary key off the parent table.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:53.610
If this all sounds confusing,

00:00:53.610 --> 00:00:55.250
let's take a look at an example.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:01:00.450
So what we have here is pretty much the same court as with the previous example.

00:01:00.450 --> 00:01:05.600
We're trying to create all these three different objects and trying to say the same.

00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:13.970
So if I run this program and go to the database,

00:01:13.970 --> 00:01:21.490
you would notice that we have three tables that corresponds to each in every class Of

00:01:21.490 --> 00:01:22.010
course,

00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:28.790
let's see what's inside in each one of these classes person,

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:32.950
boss and employee.

00:01:32.950 --> 00:01:35.650
So the person glass has all the objects.

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:42.550
And if you notice whatever the fields that are part of the person class are now shown up as

00:01:42.550 --> 00:01:50.500
the columns pretty obvious and Tim is a case of boss have been it has actually populated

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.310
its field as a column in here.

00:01:52.310 --> 00:01:54.850
But as have all the dimensions happen,

00:01:54.850 --> 00:01:58.850
it will also create the primary key for these two child classes.

00:01:58.850 --> 00:02:01.250
Are these two child tables,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:01.790
if you will,

00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:06.370
and actually map to the primary key of the parent class?

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:07.460
So in here,

00:02:07.460 --> 00:02:15.880
the employee count 100 response to the person with I D to which will be boss with a 25.

00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:18.350
Same is the case with employees as well.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.410
This is just a rough example.

00:02:20.410 --> 00:02:24.740
And even if you go to this entity,

00:02:24.740 --> 00:02:31.250
classes employees and boss and create your own identify air by auto generating or whatever

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:31.250
,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.900
it's not going to take any effect because that's how happened.

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:38.960
It works when you said this inheritance type two joined.

00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:46.950
Also note that we're trying to retrieve an entry from the database and in here.

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:51.850
I'm trying to retrieve the employees with the I didn't fire too.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:55.290
So that would be this.

00:02:55.290 --> 00:03:00.360
And when having it retrieves the same,

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:03.880
there's going to be a joint operation.

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.050
So here is the statement to help us retrieve the record.

00:03:09.050 --> 00:03:11.950
So happened it performed this joint operation.

00:03:11.950 --> 00:03:16.520
And that's the reason I believe this inheritance type is called Joined.

00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:17.460
Well,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:18.490
that's my guess.

00:03:18.490 --> 00:03:20.800
So that's about it.

00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.100
See,

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.650
assume.
