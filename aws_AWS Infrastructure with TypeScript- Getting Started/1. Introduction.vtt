00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.330
Hello and welcome to AWS Infrastructure with TypeScript: Getting Started.

2
00:00:07.330 --> 00:00:09.200
I'm David Tucker, your instructor,

3
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:11.780
and I'm excited to be walking you through how you can use

4
00:00:11.780 --> 00:00:15.840
TypeScript to create your infrastructure in the cloud.

5
00:00:15.840 --> 00:00:18.750
Now if you remember from the first course within this path,

6
00:00:18.750 --> 00:00:22.550
we were introduced to a fictional company called Globomantics,

7
00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:25.160
and we're going to be continuing our journey with them

8
00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:27.350
throughout this particular course.

9
00:00:27.350 --> 00:00:28.040
But in this case,

10
00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:30.790
we're not just going to be talking about it at a theoretical level.

11
00:00:30.790 --> 00:00:35.440
We're actually going to be building a solution using the CDK.

12
00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:36.370
So if you remember,

13
00:00:36.370 --> 00:00:40.060
Ellen was the CTO at Globomantics, and they were struggling with

14
00:00:40.060 --> 00:00:42.590
how to get all of the benefits of the cloud.

15
00:00:42.590 --> 00:00:45.320
And one of the things they identified was they need a quality

16
00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:49.240
solution for infrastructure as code and a flexible one.

17
00:00:49.240 --> 00:00:53.290
So here, within this course, we're going to be introduced to Josh,

18
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:57.050
who is a cloud architect at Globomantics. And they're going to

19
00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:59.840
be building out an initial proof of concept.

20
00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.310
So let's learn a little bit more about Josh.

21
00:01:02.310 --> 00:01:05.400
So Josh recently came to Globomantics,

22
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:09.160
and he does have a level of experience with Amazon Web Services,

23
00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:11.380
and he has worked with CloudFormation.

24
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:15.090
So the concept of infrastructure as code is not completely new to him.

25
00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:18.710
But he hasn't yet worked with the CDK, and he's the one that's

26
00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:22.160
going to be in charge of building out this proof of concept for

27
00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:25.540
their enterprise document management system.

28
00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:28.370
So we'll be following Josh as he goes through this journey,

29
00:01:28.370 --> 00:01:31.770
and here within this course, we'll be building up a sample solution.

30
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:36.240
Now here within this first module, we're going to be covering several things.

31
00:01:36.240 --> 00:01:37.070
First of all,

32
00:01:37.070 --> 00:01:39.740
we're going to be reviewing the architecture of the solution that

33
00:01:39.740 --> 00:01:42.440
we're going to be building throughout this course.

34
00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:48.320
In addition, we are going to be creating a new TypeScript CDK app using the CLI.

35
00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:51.170
And this will be the app that we work with throughout the remainder

36
00:01:51.170 --> 00:01:55.230
of this course. We're also going to be examining the project

37
00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:58.210
configuration that's generated by the CLI.

38
00:01:58.210 --> 00:02:00.010
Since we're building within TypeScript,

39
00:02:00.010 --> 00:02:05.040
we're going to see the approach that the CDK takes for TypeScript projects.

40
00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.920
We're also going to be managing our CDK packages and dependencies and

41
00:02:08.920 --> 00:02:11.610
talking through some best practices of how you do this moving

42
00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:15.570
forward. And we'll also be reviewing a concept from the previous

43
00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.200
path, which is understanding the different types of constructs that

44
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.490
are available within the CDK.

45
00:02:21.490 --> 00:02:26.370
I believe this information is essential for anyone building solutions on AWS,

46
00:02:26.370 --> 00:02:34.000
and so I'm excited that you've chosen to join me here for this course on AWS Infrastructure with TypeScript: Getting Started.
