Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.490
My name is David Tucker,

3
00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:12.470
and welcome to the course AWS Infrastructure with TypeScript: Getting Started.

4
00:00:12.470 --> 00:00:15.630
I'm a CTO consultant, and I help organizations plan,

5
00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:19.100
build, and implement custom software solutions in the cloud,

6
00:00:19.100 --> 00:00:23.840
and I have over 15 years of experience in software architecture and development.

7
00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.540
Managing cloud based infrastructure can be error prone and time consuming,

8
00:00:28.540 --> 00:00:31.070
especially without the right tools.

9
00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:33.650
Leveraging the AWS Cloud Development Kit,

10
00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:34.580
or CDK,

11
00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:38.770
with TypeScript will enable you to better manage your AWS

12
00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:42.910
infrastructure at scale. In this course, AWS Infrastructure

13
00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.640
with TypeScript: Getting Started,

14
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.560
you'll learn to implement the concept of infrastructure as code with TypeScript.

15
00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:54.010
First, you'll explore how to create a new CDK project. Next,

16
00:00:54.010 --> 00:00:57.320
you'll discover how you can manage your deployed infrastructure.

17
00:00:57.320 --> 00:00:58.000
Finally,

18
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.550
you'll learn how to configure and launch the infrastructure for a real

19
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.830
world application using AWS Fargate, API Gateway,

20
00:01:05.830 --> 00:01:08.840
Amazon S3, and AWS Lambda.

21
00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.450
When you're finished with this course,

22
00:01:10.450 --> 00:01:26.000
you'll have the skills and knowledge of the AWS CDK needed to integrate it into your custom applications on AWS.
