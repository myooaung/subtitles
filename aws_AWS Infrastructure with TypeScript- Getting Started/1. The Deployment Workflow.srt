1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,420
So now we're ready to deploy a CDK application.

2
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,480
So let's quickly revisit Josh and his proof of concept.

3
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,940
So Josh, like us, just created his first CDK app.

4
00:00:13,940 --> 00:00:19,210
He has access to an AWS account for his proof of concept, and really, here

5
00:00:19,210 --> 00:00:21,640
you should too. You should have access to an account,

6
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:24,190
ideally an account that just you are working in

7
00:00:24,190 --> 00:00:27,390
where you can deploy this as a test.

8
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,850
Now he has added a resource to his CDK app,

9
00:00:29,850 --> 00:00:35,690
and he's ready to deploy this initial app into this AWS account.

10
00:00:35,690 --> 00:00:39,850
So let's talk about how the workflow goes when you're working with the CDK.

11
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:42,110
And again, if you've reviewed the previous course,

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,880
this is going to be a bit of review.

13
00:00:43,880 --> 00:00:47,160
So first we have init, which is where you create your project,

14
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:49,040
and we have completed this.

15
00:00:49,040 --> 00:00:51,350
Now the next step is going to be bootstrapping,

16
00:00:51,350 --> 00:00:56,140
which we'll talk about within the next clip. And then we have synth,

17
00:00:56,140 --> 00:00:58,810
which is where you can generate your CloudFormation templates.

18
00:00:58,810 --> 00:01:01,760
Now, even if you don't choose to run the synth command,

19
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,460
this happens behind the scenes. And then we have deploy,

20
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,080
where we actually take those generated templates and we

21
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,170
send them off to CloudFormation.

22
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:12,090
So over this module,

23
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:15,960
we're going to be fully realizing this workflow. We're first going to be

24
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:20,140
reviewing how the CDK integrates with AWS using CloudFormation.

25
00:01:20,140 --> 00:01:23,440
We will then be bootstrapping an AWS environment.

26
00:01:23,440 --> 00:01:28,260
We will be reviewing the generated CloudFormation templates for our CDK app

27
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:33,530
and then ultimately deploying our CDK app. And then we'll be examining our

28
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:37,630
CDK app within CloudFormation in the AWS console.

29
00:01:37,630 --> 00:01:41,170
So another quick review for you is just the common CDK

30
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,230
commands for the CLI that you need to know. Now some of these

31
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:48,550
we have already used, like cdk version,

32
00:01:48,550 --> 00:01:51,510
which just lets us know the version of the CDK CLI that

33
00:01:51,510 --> 00:01:55,600
we're using, as well as cdk init where you pass in both

34
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,630
the template and the language.

35
00:01:57,630 --> 00:02:01,590
We also have cdk bootstrap that we'll be using within this module,

36
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:07,140
which, again, helps us configure a new AWS environment for use with the CDK.

37
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,540
We can also look at all of the stacks within an app with cdk list.

38
00:02:11,540 --> 00:02:16,330
Once we're ready to deploy, we'll use cdk deploy. And when we're

39
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:19,850
ready later on to actually destroy our application,

40
00:02:19,850 --> 00:02:22,440
we can use cdk destroy.

41
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,260
We also can launch the docs, which we've already done with cdk docs.

42
00:02:26,260 --> 00:02:29,330
We can compare the differences between the local version of our

43
00:02:29,330 --> 00:02:33,790
application and the deployed version with cdk diff, and we'll be

44
00:02:33,790 --> 00:02:43,000
using this within the next module. You can review those generated CloudFormation templates using cdk synth.
