00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.195
Hello, welcome back.

00:00:03.195 --> 00:00:06.150
So we're going to talk about some important shortcuts

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.560
and autocomplete functionality that's available in the JCL.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.990
Okay, So normally the new when we want to

00:00:12.990 --> 00:00:17.340
open a shell will just simply type DHL and enter, right?

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:20.400
But for example, just think about this scenario.

00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:24.150
I have a shell already in place.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.280
So when I'm opening my JCL,

00:00:26.280 --> 00:00:29.575
I want to load the things from that particular JSON file.

00:00:29.575 --> 00:00:31.880
Then I need to start doing that.

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:33.740
Okay? So for that,

00:00:33.740 --> 00:00:36.665
what we need to do is let's open the JSON first.

00:00:36.665 --> 00:00:38.825
Let's create a JS file.

00:00:38.825 --> 00:00:39.545
Okay?

00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:44.915
So I'm just going to be printed star Simple think system,

00:00:44.915 --> 00:00:49.370
dot out dot PRI AND ellen Santillan.

00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:54.020
And here we can see welcome to j.

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.770
That's all.

00:00:56.260 --> 00:00:59.270
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do,

00:00:59.270 --> 00:01:02.735
I'm gonna save this particular session into a file.

00:01:02.735 --> 00:01:05.000
Okay, so we know how to save that, right?

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.860
If you don't know, say slash hill,

00:01:06.860 --> 00:01:09.005
it will tell you what is the command for that.

00:01:09.005 --> 00:01:11.970
So for now, the comment is saved.

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:15.580
Alright, and what are the file limits you wanted to say?

00:01:15.580 --> 00:01:18.950
I can say that sample.

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:25.045
Now the file has been saved.

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:31.900
So let me exit from the bi.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.880
Okay, so now what I'm gonna do,

00:01:33.880 --> 00:01:36.535
I'm gonna start my J shell,

00:01:36.535 --> 00:01:38.170
but in a different way.

00:01:38.170 --> 00:01:40.045
Jcl, I envy.

00:01:40.045 --> 00:01:42.625
And I have an iPhone startup.

00:01:42.625 --> 00:01:47.020
And that's the one other thing which we are going to use called printing.

00:01:47.020 --> 00:01:50.035
All capital letter printing.

00:01:50.035 --> 00:01:54.080
Printing, okay? And default.

00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:58.480
And default, what is the file language are going to use?

00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:01.330
Sample dot js edge.

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.405
So the reason why we are using printing,

00:02:04.405 --> 00:02:06.370
so whenever we are printing some data,

00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:09.205
we had to provide system.out.print Allen, Right?

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:12.010
But here we can simply use print.

00:02:12.010 --> 00:02:12.880
That's all.

00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:18.220
So wherever you need to use his skull, you can use a print.

00:02:18.220 --> 00:02:23.170
Okay, so let me run the J shall first it will load the sample dot JSON,

00:02:23.170 --> 00:02:26.480
and then it will load all the defaults.

00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:32.035
And wait for a minute.

00:02:32.035 --> 00:02:37.140
Okay, So, so that's the first line will come to K shell.

00:02:37.140 --> 00:02:38.405
Okay?

00:02:38.405 --> 00:02:41.959
And then on normal default,

00:02:41.959 --> 00:02:47.765
welcome message from the J shall. Let me create a variable.

00:02:47.765 --> 00:02:50.840
We're going to talk about some shortcuts, okay?

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:53.570
Basically I'm creating a variable here,

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:55.580
like not a variable, it's just data.

00:02:55.580 --> 00:02:57.080
So what is this? It says Hello World,

00:02:57.080 --> 00:02:58.355
which is string method, right?

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:00.560
Which is a string datatype.

00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:03.770
So it has to be string and a variable name.

00:03:03.770 --> 00:03:06.080
And the data has to be asking to that.

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:09.560
So SDRAM string, for example,

00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:19.175
S equals hello, created a variable called s.

00:03:19.175 --> 00:03:19.820
Okay?

00:03:19.820 --> 00:03:23.130
The same thing. We can do it in a different way.

00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:27.545
Hello world. So what do you need to do?

00:03:27.545 --> 00:03:33.800
A shortcut, you need to use Shift and Tab together and release them.

00:03:33.800 --> 00:03:36.560
And then he enterprise, then you do plus the v,

00:03:36.560 --> 00:03:39.935
v belongs to variable Shift Tab.

00:03:39.935 --> 00:03:41.810
Just clicking Shift tab.

00:03:41.810 --> 00:03:45.785
And we see now we have this syntax curated and

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:50.390
the cursor in a place where we need to create a variable name.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:55.835
Here we can call them and say x. So any print x.

00:03:55.835 --> 00:04:04.435
Simple, right? Okay, let's create some variable called 12.2512.25.

00:04:04.435 --> 00:04:08.590
Okay, so the compiler knows what is the datatype.

00:04:08.590 --> 00:04:14.605
Okay, Let's try Shift Tab and we do automatically find out it is, it is a double.

00:04:14.605 --> 00:04:20.290
So it will create a double and it will tell you what is the variable m,

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:25.255
either variable in which we need to provide that as some other scenarios.

00:04:25.255 --> 00:04:29.365
For example, let's take I want to import something.

00:04:29.365 --> 00:04:34.510
So importing also, it's similar to creating a variable shortcut for

00:04:34.510 --> 00:04:40.405
variable Shift Tab and the V. But input Shift M and I.

00:04:40.405 --> 00:04:45.355
So first of all, let me check what are the inputs available default.

00:04:45.355 --> 00:04:48.460
Okay, let me put it this way.

00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:54.110
List I sent all so we can see them with a number.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:58.765
So the input Zhao and editor,

00:04:58.765 --> 00:05:02.380
let's remove that because once you remove the import Java util,

00:05:02.380 --> 00:05:03.880
you cannot use ArrayLists, right?

00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.570
Okay, So I'm going to draw number is five. Okay?

00:05:10.570 --> 00:05:17.480
Now, I'll check the input one more time whether you're able to see the java dot util.

00:05:17.490 --> 00:05:20.785
So we were not able to see it here.

00:05:20.785 --> 00:05:22.000
Right?

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.170
So let me try to create an ArrayList or array list.

00:05:28.170 --> 00:05:31.145
Now click Shift Tab and I.

00:05:31.145 --> 00:05:33.950
It will ask you to Option 0 for

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:37.460
nothing and one for input Java that it will that ArrayList.

00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:38.765
Okay?

00:05:38.765 --> 00:05:41.330
Just 0 means nothing.

00:05:41.330 --> 00:05:46.685
Okay, So now I'm going to again array,

00:05:46.685 --> 00:05:50.375
list, Shift Tab and I.

00:05:50.375 --> 00:05:52.595
And the choice.

00:05:52.595 --> 00:05:55.880
So the way you need to use the Shift Tab,

00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:59.705
you need to click Shift Tab together and release it.

00:05:59.705 --> 00:06:06.360
And then you're depressed V or I for we're able creation and I4 input.

00:06:06.820 --> 00:06:12.110
Okay, next thing, let me create a string.

00:06:12.110 --> 00:06:14.495
String is a class, right?

00:06:14.495 --> 00:06:19.070
So what happened on input string dot tab?

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:26.400
So basically that Tom Bill trying to show you what are the methods under the string.

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:32.000
And the string, we have a lot of different things, right?

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:35.000
Like, okay, sensitive order class as copy value format,

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.145
join and value of, okay.

00:06:37.145 --> 00:06:42.425
Similar way if you have a mat and tab,

00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:47.870
it will show you what are the elements available in math class.

00:06:47.870 --> 00:06:49.775
Okay, let's try something else mattered lot.

00:06:49.775 --> 00:06:53.270
I see now what happen?

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:54.815
It big diameter.

00:06:54.815 --> 00:06:56.825
I Tripoli reminder.

00:06:56.825 --> 00:06:59.030
If you click Tab again,

00:06:59.030 --> 00:07:04.579
it will show you some other options like press tab again to see the documentation,

00:07:04.579 --> 00:07:08.990
to know what is the exact explanation for the method.

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.340
Okay, the first time,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:11.990
which will show you all the methods.

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:14.120
The second tab it will show you the signature.

00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.645
And third tab, it will show you the documentation.

00:07:17.645 --> 00:07:20.075
Okay, let me do it again.

00:07:20.075 --> 00:07:25.520
So I'm going to use mat and say Here's the first tab.

00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:28.655
Then I'm able to see all the methods.

00:07:28.655 --> 00:07:32.780
And here let me choose any method here.

00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:38.780
Let's call it add and extract.

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:41.390
So if you click that again,

00:07:41.390 --> 00:07:44.570
it will show you the signature and one motor.

00:07:44.570 --> 00:07:46.595
It will show the documentations.

00:07:46.595 --> 00:07:49.370
Okay, so what are the method and how many parameters and what are

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.460
the types of values and what are the results and what are the exception?

00:07:52.460 --> 00:07:54.815
It should be thrown. Everything limit the spread.

00:07:54.815 --> 00:08:03.510
Okay? So now I have a variable called string S equal to demo.

00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.690
Okay? So when you use string dot,

00:08:08.690 --> 00:08:10.520
it will show you them at the end of the string class.

00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:11.840
But when you have some variable,

00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:13.700
when you put dot-dot-dot, it happened.

00:08:13.700 --> 00:08:16.970
So what are the methods that are applicable for the variable M,

00:08:16.970 --> 00:08:21.350
like for the string s dot and a tab,

00:08:21.350 --> 00:08:23.090
it will show you all the methods.

00:08:23.090 --> 00:08:27.605
So these are all the methods you can use against the string variable.

00:08:27.605 --> 00:08:31.790
That's similar way. Let me take care.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:33.605
So when you use care,

00:08:33.605 --> 00:08:38.990
there are multiple middle cerebral carrot and gaps that strike gaps.

00:08:38.990 --> 00:08:40.655
Let's click Tab again.

00:08:40.655 --> 00:08:44.175
It will show you the mantle and click Tab.

00:08:44.175 --> 00:08:47.695
So that is no input for the mountain,

00:08:47.695 --> 00:08:49.165
so it will not show you anything.

00:08:49.165 --> 00:08:51.295
Let's try car at.

00:08:51.295 --> 00:08:53.800
Okay, now click the tab again.

00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:55.180
It will show it a signature.

00:08:55.180 --> 00:08:57.280
If there is no input for the matter,

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:00.265
it will not show you anything. Click Tab again.

00:09:00.265 --> 00:09:03.040
It will show it a documentation.

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:04.150
Right?

00:09:04.150 --> 00:09:07.810
So this is how you need to make use of the shortcuts.

00:09:07.810 --> 00:09:10.510
Because if you're using an IDE,

00:09:10.510 --> 00:09:12.190
you can simply use Control Space.

00:09:12.190 --> 00:09:13.615
Our command spins right?

00:09:13.615 --> 00:09:15.430
But here it is a bit difficult,

00:09:15.430 --> 00:09:17.125
but good to know things, it's better.

00:09:17.125 --> 00:09:20.335
Okay. First time it'll show you the available option.

00:09:20.335 --> 00:09:21.970
Second show sorry.

00:09:21.970 --> 00:09:24.970
Second tab will be showing you what does the signature

00:09:24.970 --> 00:09:28.220
and third tab will be showing you what did the documentation.

00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:30.710
Okay. Thank you so much.

00:09:30.710 --> 00:09:33.000
Let's meet each other. The next video.
