00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.240
Hello developer, welcome back.

00:00:03.240 --> 00:00:07.230
So now we are going to discuss about the class when we talk about Java,

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:10.635
the hosting which comes to your mind, It's clad right?

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:12.959
So let's create a simple class.

00:00:12.959 --> 00:00:17.415
Okay, and I will show you how to run that nucleate.

00:00:17.415 --> 00:00:19.185
First.

00:00:19.185 --> 00:00:22.800
Let me create a class called test.

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:24.390
Make sure test.

00:00:24.390 --> 00:00:26.340
And I'm opening the collaborations,

00:00:26.340 --> 00:00:28.785
that means it is the starting point.

00:00:28.785 --> 00:00:31.590
And I need to create a method here, public,

00:00:31.590 --> 00:00:37.165
static, void, main, string, args.

00:00:37.165 --> 00:00:39.785
Okay, now open the curly braces.

00:00:39.785 --> 00:00:49.145
Now another systematic retard or system out print line just to print HelloWorld,

00:00:49.145 --> 00:00:53.970
print LN and say Hello World.

00:00:55.270 --> 00:01:01.655
And then close bracket for the main method and close brackets for the class.

00:01:01.655 --> 00:01:04.100
So now the class has been created.

00:01:04.100 --> 00:01:07.820
So how do we need to call the class? Okay?

00:01:07.820 --> 00:01:09.485
So normally we will create objects,

00:01:09.485 --> 00:01:12.800
since it's just a normal Java class and it has only main method,

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.325
we can simply use the class name to get the main method.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:19.220
Okay, because it's amendment I started right,

00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:22.400
test dot and I'm going to call the main method and I'm need to

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.765
pass some data here, string of 0.

00:01:26.765 --> 00:01:30.440
So now we got the data back.

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.570
Okay, It is pretty simple class,

00:01:32.570 --> 00:01:34.745
so we can do it here.

00:01:34.745 --> 00:01:36.110
Just think about the scenario.

00:01:36.110 --> 00:01:37.475
If it is.

00:01:37.475 --> 00:01:40.100
For example, it's a dy du and you are trying to

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:42.935
retrieve some data from the DTO, what will happen?

00:01:42.935 --> 00:01:46.235
So it's been difficult to do that energy shell.

00:01:46.235 --> 00:01:48.560
So we may need to use the editor.

00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:51.110
It can use the JPanel,

00:01:51.110 --> 00:01:54.530
a reader or else you can use the vertex and later.

00:01:54.530 --> 00:01:58.535
So first I'm going to set my accelerator to Notepad.

00:01:58.535 --> 00:02:00.410
Let's do that.

00:02:00.410 --> 00:02:04.690
Let me do that for known Parthenon notepad and go to Properties

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:09.430
and just check which location we had a non-permanent is copy that.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:17.695
And here come to the DHL and test set editor and paste them part here.

00:02:17.695 --> 00:02:20.305
That's all. So now we have an intersection.

00:02:20.305 --> 00:02:21.025
Okay?

00:02:21.025 --> 00:02:26.725
So what I need to do is I need to create a digital calls student.

00:02:26.725 --> 00:02:30.235
Okay? So what I'm gonna do is I'm gonna create a class,

00:02:30.235 --> 00:02:35.065
student and open bracket and close bracket.

00:02:35.065 --> 00:02:38.800
So the reason why I only created a class,

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:41.035
we can edit the class inside the editor.

00:02:41.035 --> 00:02:44.240
Okay, So how we can do that?

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.370
And study in the USA slash edit student.

00:02:51.370 --> 00:02:53.605
So now the node per has been opened.

00:02:53.605 --> 00:02:57.595
So even here it is not easy to type the code,

00:02:57.595 --> 00:03:01.090
but comparatively compared to it is pretty okay.

00:03:01.090 --> 00:03:06.535
But what I wanna do is I have a class file which contains here firstName and lastName.

00:03:06.535 --> 00:03:11.155
I'm just copied the head receptors and they can parse that song.

00:03:11.155 --> 00:03:17.890
So I'm going to paste it inside of the class.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.925
Now I'm going to save it.

00:03:18.925 --> 00:03:21.295
Just take a look at the console output here.

00:03:21.295 --> 00:03:23.230
So at each student,

00:03:23.230 --> 00:03:26.950
I replaced the class today and so we have data updated in the student.

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:32.000
Okay, so you need to close this notepad so we can continue energy shells.

00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.605
And now we have a student which contains a first name and last name.

00:03:36.605 --> 00:03:46.655
So what we're gonna do, let's create the object for the student and we'll call it S T.

00:03:46.655 --> 00:03:48.750
Sorry.

00:03:49.420 --> 00:03:51.500
Student.

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:56.510
Object name is Walt, new student.

00:03:56.510 --> 00:03:58.820
I'm I'm using the dealer can shut up

00:03:58.820 --> 00:04:01.985
because I'm using the contract which contains two string,

00:04:01.985 --> 00:04:03.890
like I'll show you here.

00:04:03.890 --> 00:04:06.860
So this is the concept I'm going to call it, right?

00:04:06.860 --> 00:04:15.920
So now I'm going to pass the data and the last name is going to call it.

00:04:16.710 --> 00:04:19.990
So now we've got the object ID in place.

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:26.635
So we can use the git receptor mentor to get the data from the class are the student.

00:04:26.635 --> 00:04:28.075
So what I'm gonna do,

00:04:28.075 --> 00:04:33.520
S dot, get first name.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:42.445
Aiden, you can do that, or you can create a string name equals.

00:04:42.445 --> 00:04:44.260
And you can do this.

00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:46.105
Now if we print name,

00:04:46.105 --> 00:04:49.600
you will, you'll be able to see the name.

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.570
Okay, So now I'm going to use the set method to modify the name,

00:04:52.570 --> 00:04:56.675
okay, data set, first name.

00:04:56.675 --> 00:04:59.165
So the name I'm going to modify.

00:04:59.165 --> 00:05:02.340
I interrupt film when I asked Dan.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.820
Okay, so now we updated the data.

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.540
Let me try to get called the getMethod and we'll see what's going to happen.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:17.405
See now that gets mad, that has been it then a different data which is the updated one.

00:05:17.405 --> 00:05:23.420
Okay? So this is a way you need to use the classes instead of j shell a.

00:05:23.420 --> 00:05:27.245
Then you can use, if you're really confident and you feel comfortable,

00:05:27.245 --> 00:05:30.710
you can go ahead and do the programming in

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:33.530
the Jewish ellipse that has some scenarios you may

00:05:33.530 --> 00:05:36.920
need editor like notepad, Notepad Plus, Plus.

00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:41.450
You can still go for it or else you're going to write your sample coordinator replicator.

00:05:41.450 --> 00:05:44.480
Because when you're doing it in the JCL,

00:05:44.480 --> 00:05:46.955
it might take time because we have to type everything.

00:05:46.955 --> 00:05:49.100
But when I go for ID, it will give you the citation.

00:05:49.100 --> 00:05:51.200
You can simply create the getter setter and create

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.515
a constructor and copy paste the matter here.

00:05:54.515 --> 00:05:57.230
Okay, let's see it in the next video.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:05:58.650
Thank you.
