00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.140
Hello, developers will come to Java nine.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:08.850
Okay, So we just finished up jiao eight and now we're jumping into Java name.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:11.130
Okay, Before we are jumping into Java nine,

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:14.880
let's briefly talk about what we discussed,

00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:18.420
everything about geoid, at least the new features, okay,

00:00:18.420 --> 00:00:19.785
as a part of Java 8,

00:00:19.785 --> 00:00:23.640
we got lambda expression and the functional programming and

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.430
functional interfaces and screams and battled streams and timing API.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.870
There are a lot of changes,

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:33.035
comes in as part of Java 8.

00:00:33.035 --> 00:00:35.840
Okay? So continue to Java 8.

00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:38.345
We have Java nine now, okay?

00:00:38.345 --> 00:00:41.495
And it came up with new concepts.

00:00:41.495 --> 00:00:46.475
Okay, So we're going to discuss about what are the new futures,

00:00:46.475 --> 00:00:49.580
which is came as a part of Java nine.

00:00:49.580 --> 00:00:55.130
Okay, Let's talk about that firstName.

00:00:55.130 --> 00:00:58.880
So what are the new things in Java name?

00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:00.665
Okay, there are quite a lot of

00:01:00.665 --> 00:01:03.785
new functionalities has been introduced as a part of Java nine.

00:01:03.785 --> 00:01:07.710
Let's see each, each and every one.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:11.590
The first one, Java Shell.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:13.720
So we can call them as a rebel.

00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:18.475
Okay, so I'm going to list dot or what are the new changes in Germany.

00:01:18.475 --> 00:01:21.895
And then we will jump onto each and every concept.

00:01:21.895 --> 00:01:27.220
The first one is Java ripple and another one is private methods in interfaces.

00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:28.465
And then another one,

00:01:28.465 --> 00:01:30.985
the faculty matters for collections.

00:01:30.985 --> 00:01:35.230
And the next one, the changes in the resources,

00:01:35.230 --> 00:01:39.895
okay, which came as a part of Java 7 and it came up with some new updates.

00:01:39.895 --> 00:01:43.090
And then, then announcement in Java

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.670
eight streams API because we have a Streams API, right?

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:52.055
It just came as part of GI aid and it has some additional enhancement in Java nine.

00:01:52.055 --> 00:01:54.005
And another important thing,

00:01:54.005 --> 00:01:58.055
JVM as the Java platform module system,

00:01:58.055 --> 00:02:01.265
we'll talk about a lot of JVMs.

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:03.320
And next diamond operator,

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:05.270
we know what is the assignment operator, right?

00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:07.580
So the less than and greater than symbol.

00:02:07.580 --> 00:02:10.250
And we're going to talk about a lot of a diamond operator.

00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:14.570
And then save that argues annotations and the process API updates

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.145
how our programs are going to talk to the missions are APIs,

00:02:19.145 --> 00:02:23.000
or how it is going to interact with the direct process and what kind

00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.840
of processes running behind the systems that are behind the screens.

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:29.270
And there are a lot of new updates.

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:33.515
Okay? And then has to w2 client.

00:02:33.515 --> 00:02:37.490
So it is Java how I can send a high stupid question,

00:02:37.490 --> 00:02:42.020
or that's the greatest part of Java when we were able to

00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:46.895
send a get request to that UTEP using this client.

00:02:46.895 --> 00:02:50.675
And that is a change in D1 garbage collector.

00:02:50.675 --> 00:02:53.360
And the last thing is jailing.

00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:57.110
Okay, so we're gonna talk about H and everything.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:58.355
Okay?

00:02:58.355 --> 00:03:05.165
So the next video we're going to talk about Java Shell and what is the ripple.

00:03:05.165 --> 00:03:07.740
Okay, thank you.
