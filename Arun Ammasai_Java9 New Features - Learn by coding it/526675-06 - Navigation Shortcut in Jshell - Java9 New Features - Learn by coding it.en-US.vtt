00:00:00.200 --> 00:00:03.555
Hello, developers will come back.

00:00:03.555 --> 00:00:07.020
So now I'm gonna show you some simple shortcuts,

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.150
linear using gestural that are scenarios.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:11.550
You need some shortcuts, right?

00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:15.460
For example, I have a statement like Hello.

00:00:15.650 --> 00:00:17.805
Hello, John.

00:00:17.805 --> 00:00:23.235
How are you? How are you and you type something else here.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:24.855
So basically what you need to do,

00:00:24.855 --> 00:00:27.990
I type something wrong, okay,

00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:32.400
so I want to delete something so you can use the backspace

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:38.115
or it can move using your navigational key, left or right.

00:00:38.115 --> 00:00:41.015
And then you can delete the data.

00:00:41.015 --> 00:00:43.235
This is pretty much the same thing it is.

00:00:43.235 --> 00:00:45.200
We all know that why I need to tell that.

00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:48.600
But for example, how are you?

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.675
John?

00:00:50.675 --> 00:00:59.210
So for I want to delete whatever comes after, How are you?

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:01.130
So that has shortcut for that,

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:03.185
you can use Control K,

00:01:03.185 --> 00:01:07.879
C, up to the arrow selector, everything.

00:01:07.879 --> 00:01:12.830
Okay, in case I want to delete the word previous to my cursor,

00:01:12.830 --> 00:01:16.025
you can use Control W.

00:01:16.025 --> 00:01:21.335
So Control K, it will delete what is there after the cursor.

00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:25.910
And Control W, which will delete the previous word before the cursor.

00:01:25.910 --> 00:01:28.590
Can you change your mind?

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.110
Okay, I don't want to delete everything,

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:34.895
I want them back.

00:01:34.895 --> 00:01:40.295
You can simply retrieve them Control Y, right?

00:01:40.295 --> 00:01:42.620
So it will come,

00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.230
if you keep pressing Control way, what will happen?

00:01:45.230 --> 00:01:49.140
It will keep returning the previous data which is deleted.

00:01:49.570 --> 00:01:51.260
Got it.

00:01:51.260 --> 00:01:53.585
So this particular functionality,

00:01:53.585 --> 00:01:55.010
I'm in this particular shortcuts,

00:01:55.010 --> 00:01:59.420
which will help you when you're doing the huge chunk of code.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.665
Here.

00:02:00.665 --> 00:02:02.780
For example, I want to go to the,

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:05.510
for example, I have a statement here.

00:02:05.510 --> 00:02:07.850
I want to go to the beginning of the segment.

00:02:07.850 --> 00:02:10.445
Normally for the Windows system, you can hit home.

00:02:10.445 --> 00:02:12.140
See the cursor.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:15.650
It came into the beginning.

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:17.585
And if you want to go to the end,

00:02:17.585 --> 00:02:21.050
you can use the End key.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.115
Right?

00:02:22.115 --> 00:02:28.880
But in a Mac, it one load like that because we need to use a specific keys.

00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:33.155
Even here it is pretty much framing windows and Mac,

00:02:33.155 --> 00:02:36.545
because here it's Control on Windows. It's a comment.

00:02:36.545 --> 00:02:37.985
Okay, I want to go to the beginning.

00:02:37.985 --> 00:02:41.010
You can simply use Control.

00:02:41.650 --> 00:02:44.240
Hey, what happened?

00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.145
It went to the beginning of the statement.

00:02:46.145 --> 00:02:49.100
And I want to go to the end, control E,

00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:52.560
That means and Control E.

00:02:53.410 --> 00:03:00.155
So this though you need to make use of the shortcuts.

00:03:00.155 --> 00:03:04.490
There are a lot of other shortcuts available which we need to check.

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.595
But before that, just make use of this.

00:03:07.595 --> 00:03:14.195
But at least he noticed that is a way you can travel or navigate to the beginning in,

00:03:14.195 --> 00:03:17.150
and you know how to delete a before the cursor.

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:22.140
The cursor, these things are really, really basic stuff.

00:03:22.360 --> 00:03:29.720
All right, In the next video we're going to talk about what even more about that J shell.

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.850
But it is going to be a little different.

00:03:31.850 --> 00:03:37.550
Okay, so we're gonna talk about how we're going to use the variables and the methods.

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:42.500
And also, I'm not liking this particular environment.

00:03:42.500 --> 00:03:45.455
I want to edit maze piece of code in a separate editor.

00:03:45.455 --> 00:03:46.700
How we can do that?

00:03:46.700 --> 00:03:51.930
So we will discuss everything in the next video. Thank you.
