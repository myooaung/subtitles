00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.045
Hello developers, welcome back.

00:00:03.045 --> 00:00:09.270
We're going to talk about some additional things that we'll do variables. Let me try.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:11.400
I just opened my gesture here.

00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:13.950
Let me create a variable.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:17.550
X is equal to n.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:21.345
You know what happened? It thinks that it's an adult.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:23.370
X is not defined anywhere.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.825
The first time unit to declare it is this normal Java syntax. X is equal to 10.

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:29.580
So now I have a variable.

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:35.285
Now I have another variable into I is equal to 20.

00:00:35.285 --> 00:00:40.160
Then what you can do, you can simply create another variable where you can

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:45.810
store the result of a plus b or x plus y.

00:00:48.490 --> 00:00:51.020
It is 30, right?

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:57.635
So now let's use the help to see how many variables has been created.

00:00:57.635 --> 00:00:59.180
We notice index slash,

00:00:59.180 --> 00:01:03.545
and that's so I have x,

00:01:03.545 --> 00:01:09.050
y, and c. And I'm going to cut down on the string here.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:14.580
String S is equal to John.

00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:22.270
Now let's try. I'm just using the navigation geek keyboard up and down.

00:01:22.270 --> 00:01:24.895
It will move to the previous common,

00:01:24.895 --> 00:01:27.190
and it will move to the next comment also.

00:01:27.190 --> 00:01:30.680
So now we have a full variables here.

00:01:30.900 --> 00:01:35.035
In case there is a some other command,

00:01:35.035 --> 00:01:42.070
the hell comment, dot ISN all.

00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:45.025
We shall give you the same thing.

00:01:45.025 --> 00:01:45.715
Okay?

00:01:45.715 --> 00:01:48.745
So that means it'll give you all the variables that all,

00:01:48.745 --> 00:01:51.260
it's pretty much the same thing.

00:01:51.990 --> 00:01:57.400
Let's do the same for virus tried before.

00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:59.095
Let's try it here.

00:01:59.095 --> 00:02:01.340
Yes.

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.300
I have sent again,

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.625
it's give me the same thing. So it's up to you.

00:02:06.625 --> 00:02:08.780
You can use anything.

00:02:09.390 --> 00:02:12.775
For example, I don't want to know all of them.

00:02:12.775 --> 00:02:17.650
I just want to know only any one variable which I wanted to.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:20.275
Okay, let's do that.

00:02:20.275 --> 00:02:26.950
Slash var so you can probably see why it would provide only what are you looking for?

00:02:26.950 --> 00:02:30.310
Okay, I don't want the variable y,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:32.290
I want a remote from the history.

00:02:32.290 --> 00:02:36.610
So what you can do, that is where we need to use a drop and use

00:02:36.610 --> 00:02:43.850
the variable name, dropped variable y.

00:02:43.850 --> 00:02:47.345
So now let's try to do the history.

00:02:47.345 --> 00:02:51.185
It will show you what other things which we have done so far.

00:02:51.185 --> 00:02:56.105
Greater variables in great data string and we tried all,

00:02:56.105 --> 00:02:59.690
and that's all specific area well to drop and the history.

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:05.285
So let's create a list of string which will contain some names.

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:07.310
So you can call them as a name.

00:03:07.310 --> 00:03:14.000
I'm going to use the list of matter which will vary.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:20.435
It can provide some names, John, John,

00:03:20.435 --> 00:03:30.815
and let's have another name. Okay.

00:03:30.815 --> 00:03:33.020
So now I have another variable.

00:03:33.020 --> 00:03:35.160
Let's do the valves now.

00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:40.850
So now we have one more variable added into my list.

00:03:40.850 --> 00:03:43.160
Or you can do this list,

00:03:43.160 --> 00:03:47.165
which will tell you what are the things we have done so far.

00:03:47.165 --> 00:03:49.685
One integer x.

00:03:49.685 --> 00:03:51.590
And second one is the litter.

00:03:51.590 --> 00:03:53.105
The why we did it already.

00:03:53.105 --> 00:03:58.055
So that 1345, which is nothing but that is the ID.

00:03:58.055 --> 00:04:03.290
Either you can drop a variable by using ID or the variable.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:08.885
Let me try to use the drop with the variable m. Let's try with the ID.

00:04:08.885 --> 00:04:11.285
So number three is in DC, right?

00:04:11.285 --> 00:04:13.760
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna draw up and I'm going to provide

00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:16.610
three dropped variable c.

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:21.585
So that is where the radiation comes into the place it is working smart.

00:04:21.585 --> 00:04:23.005
Okay.

00:04:23.005 --> 00:04:25.030
So I have a list of names, right?

00:04:25.030 --> 00:04:27.805
Can we do the canon try to get any specific names.

00:04:27.805 --> 00:04:29.140
Okay, so what I'm gonna do,

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.990
I'm gonna get a string of name.

00:04:31.990 --> 00:04:34.045
My name, it's a cold.

00:04:34.045 --> 00:04:37.105
So what is the list of names? Names is a keyword.

00:04:37.105 --> 00:04:39.490
Names dot get off.

00:04:39.490 --> 00:04:41.785
I'm going to get first-person.

00:04:41.785 --> 00:04:43.615
First-person.

00:04:43.615 --> 00:04:48.830
So the person name is Phil,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:53.275
and it is stored into a variable called name.

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:55.390
Now, just to the virus,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:58.780
you can see one more variable adder if we wanted to know the ideal,

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.490
also, just use a list.

00:05:00.490 --> 00:05:04.250
You can see the variable names with the id.

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:13.985
All right, so now what I'm gonna do is let's create a list which contains some data.

00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:20.540
And what we can do simply any index gets scenario.

00:05:20.540 --> 00:05:23.255
Okay, let's create a list.

00:05:23.255 --> 00:05:24.920
Okay, we have a list already, right?

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.620
So we can simply rename it here.

00:05:28.900 --> 00:05:39.050
Rename. So I'm going to name as names one.

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.330
And repeat the same thing,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:54.390
names2, and just modify the names here.

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:02.670
And

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.330
now I have

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:18.560
a list of one and list two.

00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.825
I'm going to combine them. For example, how we can do that?

00:06:23.825 --> 00:06:25.400
Bottom list, right?

00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:27.365
So I need to combine them into one.

00:06:27.365 --> 00:06:29.120
So it's going to build a staff list.

00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:39.875
So string name list

00:06:39.875 --> 00:06:44.000
is a list.

00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:47.730
And here I'm going to use names,

00:06:48.010 --> 00:06:56.220
names if you want to print the data.

00:07:00.100 --> 00:07:04.110
So we can use a for loop

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:14.250
or name, name list.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:18.480
And then for each mentor.

00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:25.760
And then print system dot out and I'm going to use them into preference here.

00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:32.255
Print LN, print, name, list and flourish.

00:07:32.255 --> 00:07:34.040
Cannot find symbol.

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:37.715
Nameless is not available. Okay?

00:07:37.715 --> 00:07:40.830
So L has to be capital letter.

00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:44.790
So now we've got the data.
