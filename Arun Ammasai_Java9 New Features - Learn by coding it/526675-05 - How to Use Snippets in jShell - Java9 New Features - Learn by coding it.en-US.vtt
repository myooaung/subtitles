00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:03.175
Hello developers, welcome back.

00:00:03.175 --> 00:00:05.770
Let's talk about snippets.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.915
So what is snippet?

00:00:07.915 --> 00:00:13.000
Is nothing but whatever we are trying to do,

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.290
we're trying to create a method.

00:00:14.290 --> 00:00:16.075
We are trying to create a variable.

00:00:16.075 --> 00:00:21.265
We can simply say them as a piece of code or piece of something.

00:00:21.265 --> 00:00:22.420
It is called a cynic,

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:25.285
but day-to-day basis, whatever the code we're trying,

00:00:25.285 --> 00:00:29.905
those are all little bit of peace and each and everything is a piece of snippets.

00:00:29.905 --> 00:00:33.220
Okay, you are doing one piece of code, somebody else's,

00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:36.970
we use creating some piece of code and you are combining to them.

00:00:36.970 --> 00:00:40.300
So you have one snippet and they have some other snip,

00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:41.545
but you're combining both of them.

00:00:41.545 --> 00:00:43.390
You have a two snippets in place.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:48.085
It's just nothing but a piece of information that is what we call a snippets.

00:00:48.085 --> 00:00:51.890
Let me try. I'm open to jail here.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:58.990
Take a second. So what we're going to do,

00:00:58.990 --> 00:01:00.100
I'm going to do the same thing,

00:01:00.100 --> 00:01:01.450
whatever we have tried so far,

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:04.900
for example, one plus two is three.

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:08.140
It's a snippet. I'm going to create a variable.

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:12.820
Int a is equal to 20.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:14.800
It sounded the snippet,

00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:17.150
it will create another variable.

00:01:19.890 --> 00:01:29.825
B is equal to t. This is another snippet I can try create another variable,

00:01:29.825 --> 00:01:33.860
int b is equal to 10.

00:01:33.860 --> 00:01:37.085
So let's try to check all the values here.

00:01:37.085 --> 00:01:40.530
So I have three variables in place.

00:01:41.620 --> 00:01:46.350
Let me try to add a and b,

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:50.820
a plus B, C, 30.

00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:55.715
So that is the way the shell,

00:01:55.715 --> 00:01:57.020
the shell will work.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:59.420
It will keep everything in his memory.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:02.255
Okay, So whenever we need, we can make use of it.

00:02:02.255 --> 00:02:06.720
If, for example, if you want to do something like 15

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:16.850
plus phi, same thing, right?

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:18.770
Let me try something different.

00:02:18.770 --> 00:02:28.085
I never tried it before, but let me try 5056.

00:02:28.085 --> 00:02:29.975
Still it's Fox.

00:02:29.975 --> 00:02:33.530
I use 50 and I use the ID,

00:02:33.530 --> 00:02:37.415
which is nothing but the scratch with a billion dollars six,

00:02:37.415 --> 00:02:41.645
seven created which stores the 105.

00:02:41.645 --> 00:02:45.630
So whatever you have done so far, it's all snippets.

00:02:46.390 --> 00:02:54.599
Let me, let me create a string variable, string.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:02:58.595
Hello.

00:02:58.595 --> 00:03:00.830
So I have a string variable here.

00:03:00.830 --> 00:03:08.630
Now what I'm gonna do, I'm going to S is equal to hello world.

00:03:08.630 --> 00:03:10.670
Now let's print it.

00:03:10.670 --> 00:03:11.825
I guess.

00:03:11.825 --> 00:03:15.545
I haven't string existing, but I will write it.

00:03:15.545 --> 00:03:19.490
As a game. It is pretty much whatever we

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:22.895
are doing the day-to-day basis in Java program, it's the same thing.

00:03:22.895 --> 00:03:24.904
It's just another environment.

00:03:24.904 --> 00:03:28.970
You can simply tell them it's a playground for the Java developers.

00:03:28.970 --> 00:03:30.125
Right?

00:03:30.125 --> 00:03:34.230
Let me create a matter here wide.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.245
And which will accept two integers,

00:03:42.245 --> 00:03:45.515
int a, int b.

00:03:45.515 --> 00:03:51.425
So what I'm gonna do, I'm gonna print system dot out,

00:03:51.425 --> 00:03:56.790
dot, print LN, and here a plus B.

00:04:02.950 --> 00:04:11.630
That's happening. So now I have a problem here, system.out.print.

00:04:11.630 --> 00:04:14.880
Okay, I have a problem with don't print lm,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:24.850
print, print LN.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.010
So what I did, I created my third here,

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:34.370
the open and close press I did not provide.

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:38.830
So the method has been created now.

00:04:38.830 --> 00:04:42.700
So how we can call them simple, the estimator name,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:48.160
ad and see what I tried.

00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:52.915
I tried I tried to type a and I'm trying to click the tab file.

00:04:52.915 --> 00:04:57.615
And it will show you what are the things available, add available.

00:04:57.615 --> 00:05:00.275
This is called autofill.

00:05:00.275 --> 00:05:01.310
Okay.

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:02.330
We'll discuss about a lot.

00:05:02.330 --> 00:05:04.625
Okay, for now I'm going to pass two variables,

00:05:04.625 --> 00:05:07.820
ten comma 25, C,

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:11.580
I got 35. My outcome.

00:05:12.430 --> 00:05:13.985
Right?

00:05:13.985 --> 00:05:18.875
So this is the important thing which you need to know about the snippets.

00:05:18.875 --> 00:05:21.050
See whatever we are doing that's going to be snippet.

00:05:21.050 --> 00:05:21.875
Okay?

00:05:21.875 --> 00:05:27.695
So you can save the snippets into a single file and then you can load it later.

00:05:27.695 --> 00:05:29.555
Okay, once you save the snippet,

00:05:29.555 --> 00:05:33.650
you can open it and then you can continuously start using that.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:36.540
Okay, Let's see each other next video. Thank you.
