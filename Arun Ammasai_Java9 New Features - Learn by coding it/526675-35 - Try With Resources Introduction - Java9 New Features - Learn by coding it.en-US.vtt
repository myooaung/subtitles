00:00:00.140 --> 00:00:03.540
Hello everyone, Welcome back.

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.320
So there is another important announcement has been done.

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.000
And that is was pertain,

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.684
which is nothing but try with resource.

00:00:11.684 --> 00:00:16.140
So what is art and what isn't a resource?

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:19.860
And we're going to talk about everything from how the resources looks like before

00:00:19.860 --> 00:00:23.370
Java 76 and what

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:27.880
happened in Java 8 and what happened in Java 7 and what happened in Java 9.

00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.410
Let's talk about that.

00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:33.140
The first advantage, okay,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:34.730
let's talk about the advantage is done.

00:00:34.730 --> 00:00:36.575
We'll move on to the actual coding.

00:00:36.575 --> 00:00:40.520
Okay, So when you're using try with resources,

00:00:40.520 --> 00:00:41.975
the first important thing,

00:00:41.975 --> 00:00:43.940
you don't need to write much code.

00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:45.770
We can see it in a real example.

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.200
And the code readability, It's amazing.

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.365
And finally block is going to be no more.

00:00:51.365 --> 00:00:52.460
It is going to be optional.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:55.085
It will be still there, but it's kind of optional.

00:00:55.085 --> 00:00:57.110
And auto close.

00:00:57.110 --> 00:00:59.659
There is a problem with most of the scenarios.

00:00:59.659 --> 00:01:04.400
We used to write a try catch block and we had to create a lot of resources.

00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:07.594
There are scenarios we will forward to closest resources.

00:01:07.594 --> 00:01:13.355
So Java seven came up solution to auto closer resources.

00:01:13.355 --> 00:01:17.825
And we'll talk about how the try with resource looks like, okay,

00:01:17.825 --> 00:01:21.935
how we're going to handle the exception in the first place.

00:01:21.935 --> 00:01:24.410
So just take a look at with this particular piece of code.

00:01:24.410 --> 00:01:27.380
I have a buffer reader and I have a try catch block.

00:01:27.380 --> 00:01:29.375
And also I have a finally.

00:01:29.375 --> 00:01:33.110
So try blog which I contain some resources.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:35.555
And there is, just take a look at the code,

00:01:35.555 --> 00:01:40.145
the resources I had to define before the try catch block.

00:01:40.145 --> 00:01:45.440
So only I'm able to access in the finally block, the BufferedReader instance.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.565
So this is how the code looks like and before Java 7.

00:01:49.565 --> 00:01:52.430
So what happened in Java 7?

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:57.604
Java 7, that try with resource contract has been introduced.

00:01:57.604 --> 00:02:00.950
So just take a look at the code in a try block.

00:02:00.950 --> 00:02:06.270
You can open a function parameter and you can pass the resources in it.

00:02:07.480 --> 00:02:12.095
So that means whenever the try-block has been closed,

00:02:12.095 --> 00:02:16.295
it means that the program automatically close its own resources.

00:02:16.295 --> 00:02:22.340
Like in this case, it's a buffer reader and catch block you can handle the scenario.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:25.220
So what are the business logic going to

00:02:25.220 --> 00:02:28.565
implement in case of any exception comes on the try block.

00:02:28.565 --> 00:02:31.790
So here the finally block is not required.

00:02:31.790 --> 00:02:39.500
So, so in Java and n,

00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:40.775
what is the change happened?

00:02:40.775 --> 00:02:45.005
Because try with resource has been introduced in Java 7 itself.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:47.465
So what the announcement date and then a Java name.

00:02:47.465 --> 00:02:53.675
So basically in Java 70 can use resource inside the try block.

00:02:53.675 --> 00:02:57.454
Okay, in euthanasia, the function parameters.

00:02:57.454 --> 00:03:02.585
But in Java and you can use the research already opened.

00:03:02.585 --> 00:03:06.380
And one other thing is that resource has to be implemented by

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:11.270
the auto closable interface called auto closable.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:16.550
It has reimplement that particular class which contains the closed my dad.

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:17.990
Here I have a BufferedReader,

00:03:17.990 --> 00:03:20.585
we're VR1, VR2 be R3, right?

00:03:20.585 --> 00:03:24.980
And just take a look at the try block which contains BAR, BAR on.

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:27.905
Because we did the single try with resource,

00:03:27.905 --> 00:03:30.350
you can use multiple resources.

00:03:30.350 --> 00:03:33.920
You don't have because this think about the scenario.

00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:35.450
If it is the same scenario,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:38.720
it needs to be handled in the normal allele motions.

00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.315
You how to create each and every instance.

00:03:41.315 --> 00:03:42.725
That is a common always.

00:03:42.725 --> 00:03:44.900
But do you have to explicitly close each and

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:48.380
every resources and which we need to do it manually.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:51.275
And what happened if in case any close method

00:03:51.275 --> 00:03:55.310
throws an exception in the finally block unit writer.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:03:58.850
Another try-catch block.

00:03:58.850 --> 00:04:03.380
Here I've done the finally block just to show you a beer at closer, just not necessary.

00:04:03.380 --> 00:04:05.750
I'm just showing you but I should have removed it,

00:04:05.750 --> 00:04:07.730
but it is not necessary.

00:04:07.730 --> 00:04:11.750
But you can still keep it in case if you want to close it here,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.495
the BIA that closest not a valid one.

00:04:14.495 --> 00:04:15.770
Right?

00:04:15.770 --> 00:04:19.500
Because it can be accessed only in the try block.

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:24.980
And honor, another modern thing is whenever you are using some resources and they'll

00:04:24.980 --> 00:04:29.570
try block made sure that is our final or called as F appeal finance.

00:04:29.570 --> 00:04:33.455
Nothing but it cannot be changed at any point of time.

00:04:33.455 --> 00:04:37.845
So if it's trying to modify it in some other scenarios,

00:04:37.845 --> 00:04:41.710
it will be end up with an exception.

00:04:41.710 --> 00:04:44.905
Let me show you how the court shouldn't be here.

00:04:44.905 --> 00:04:49.160
So the example has to be it has to be, this is wrong.

00:04:49.740 --> 00:04:52.180
This is wrong.

00:04:52.180 --> 00:04:55.495
Because when you use try with resources,

00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:58.720
everything has been closed inside of the try block itself.

00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:03.010
This particular line of code has been executor or the reasons that had been closed.

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:11.090
Or if you want, you're going to click my Layers and B or something like that.

00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:14.380
Okay, Let's see a simple example of

00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:20.660
how Java 600 exception on Java 7 and how it is implemented in Java name.
