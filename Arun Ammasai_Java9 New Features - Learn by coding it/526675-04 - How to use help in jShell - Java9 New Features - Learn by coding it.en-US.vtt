00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:03.525
Hello developers, welcome back.

00:00:03.525 --> 00:00:07.785
So now we're going to discuss a vote, some help.

00:00:07.785 --> 00:00:10.080
So we're new to JCL, right?

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:13.605
So I just want to know what are the things which we can do ingestion.

00:00:13.605 --> 00:00:17.295
So you don't have to go and refer for some external documentation.

00:00:17.295 --> 00:00:22.250
J shall itself comes with proper help documentation.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:23.150
Okay.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:25.760
Just take a look at I just open my J shell.

00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:27.530
And here you have an,

00:00:27.530 --> 00:00:31.249
a small hint help intro.

00:00:31.249 --> 00:00:35.360
So if you want to know something or any specific item you can

00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:39.440
use the slash help ensure. Okay.

00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:42.860
So whatever you are trying to implement in say,

00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.320
the Jewish girl from the helping past,

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:48.110
but you are closing the gestural unit to

00:00:48.110 --> 00:00:51.050
use them backslash and then you need to try everything,

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:53.270
okay, for now what I'm gonna do,

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.330
I'm gonna do backslash and I'm going to do help.

00:00:56.330 --> 00:00:59.930
It will show you a list of the things which we can do.

00:00:59.930 --> 00:01:01.925
In JCL.

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:04.295
Let's come from the beginning.

00:01:04.295 --> 00:01:10.235
Type of a Java language expression statement or declaration or type of Type,

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:11.780
one of the following comments.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.685
So these are the following comments.

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:21.095
We can make use of it when you're doing some coding into the JSON. What is list?

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:26.210
List, which will show you what are the things which you have done so far.

00:01:26.210 --> 00:01:27.800
I, I did one plus two,

00:01:27.800 --> 00:01:29.315
and i plus hello, plus volt.

00:01:29.315 --> 00:01:32.014
And I did some list creation.

00:01:32.014 --> 00:01:35.285
And I did something else also.

00:01:35.285 --> 00:01:41.525
It will give you the list of process what you have done so far.

00:01:41.525 --> 00:01:44.675
The next one is slash edit.

00:01:44.675 --> 00:01:48.455
You have done 567 steps, okay?

00:01:48.455 --> 00:01:52.865
But you want to update the fourth step.

00:01:52.865 --> 00:01:57.830
What you can do, you can use the slash edit and you can provide this

00:01:57.830 --> 00:02:03.980
for and drop to remove something.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:07.370
And the Open to open some file input.

00:02:07.370 --> 00:02:13.445
And that's which will tell you what are the variables so far you have used.

00:02:13.445 --> 00:02:16.280
And methods, which is the same thing.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.285
If you are in a huge chunk of code,

00:02:18.285 --> 00:02:23.600
it will tell you how many meters you created and what type of it and what are the inputs,

00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:27.995
the input we already seen and Exit.

00:02:27.995 --> 00:02:30.500
So which will close the JCL.

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:36.740
Similar to that, there are a lot of helping tips here.

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:38.390
So what you can do, okay,

00:02:38.390 --> 00:02:42.200
let me try with this one, intro slash help.

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.890
Intro.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:48.050
It will tell you what JCL is about.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:51.260
A generalist tool allows you to execute java code.

00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.255
Getting immediate wrestled with any class of methods, right?

00:02:56.255 --> 00:02:58.700
And what is ID? I don't know what is ID.

00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:00.140
Let's try that help.

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.015
And ID.

00:03:02.015 --> 00:03:05.285
Id is nothing but whenever you are trying to do some operations,

00:03:05.285 --> 00:03:06.890
for example, we did one plus two,

00:03:06.890 --> 00:03:09.140
right? What will happen?

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:14.120
We got three as a resultant that three will be stored into a variable.

00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.000
So that is the ID. So we can call them as

00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:20.105
a variable name or you can tell him as the ID also the reference.

00:03:20.105 --> 00:03:23.975
Let me try something here, 1 plus 2.

00:03:23.975 --> 00:03:27.650
So that $1.1 is ID for the three,

00:03:27.650 --> 00:03:32.975
you can simply tell them it's a variable also earned. I'll do Hello World.

00:03:32.975 --> 00:03:36.695
Hello World.

00:03:36.695 --> 00:03:38.825
See what's happening here.

00:03:38.825 --> 00:03:43.250
And I'm doing system dot out,

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:48.960
dot, print LN high.

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:54.110
So they have tried three different operations, right?

00:03:54.110 --> 00:03:56.660
So let's see what list is doing.

00:03:56.660 --> 00:03:58.775
Backslash list.

00:03:58.775 --> 00:04:03.095
It will tell you the list of operations you have done so far.

00:04:03.095 --> 00:04:06.890
If you want to know only what is the second step, okay?

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:11.180
List. And it will tell you what is the second operation or you have

00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:16.175
done our second process.

00:04:16.175 --> 00:04:20.705
What else? Let's see inputs which we already dried.

00:04:20.705 --> 00:04:24.275
It will show you what are the and default inputs.

00:04:24.275 --> 00:04:28.625
Okay, Let's do the help again and we'll see something else.

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:32.165
Let's save that, help us.

00:04:32.165 --> 00:04:34.895
Or let's try it.

00:04:34.895 --> 00:04:37.715
Now we have to,

00:04:37.715 --> 00:04:39.320
but because we tried,

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:41.180
just take a look at the list.

00:04:41.180 --> 00:04:42.740
We have tried three operation.

00:04:42.740 --> 00:04:44.750
But the third operation which will not create

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.960
any variables because that is just to printing the data one plus two,

00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:50.885
it will return a data and it will be stored into a variable.

00:04:50.885 --> 00:04:53.600
Hello plus, well, it's a concatenation operation that a,

00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.670
it will attend something it'll store in a variable.

00:04:55.670 --> 00:05:01.325
But system.out.print tell is just a print statement we cannot receive with a variable.

00:05:01.325 --> 00:05:04.145
So that is a reason we have only two variables.

00:05:04.145 --> 00:05:06.845
If I want to drop one other variable.

00:05:06.845 --> 00:05:11.615
How we can do that? That is where the drop comes into place, drop.

00:05:11.615 --> 00:05:15.320
You can provide the number,

00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:19.775
or let's try to sow dropped variable number 2.

00:05:19.775 --> 00:05:23.840
Now what we can do, let's try to search the baths again.

00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.215
That means variables. Again, we got only one.

00:05:27.215 --> 00:05:29.820
Let's try history.

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.870
History will show you what are the things

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:35.300
which we have done so far from the beginning of the session,

00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.100
beginning to decision and help,

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:38.780
help in row ID 1 plus 2,

00:05:38.780 --> 00:05:40.220
everything, whatever we did,

00:05:40.220 --> 00:05:42.125
everything will be stored in history.

00:05:42.125 --> 00:05:44.705
But once you exited the shell,

00:05:44.705 --> 00:05:48.170
everything has been raise it back to

00:05:48.170 --> 00:05:53.270
the initial version so you cannot retrieve it again if you want to.

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.960
You need to save this snippet or save the entire session,

00:05:56.960 --> 00:05:59.225
whatever you have done so far.

00:05:59.225 --> 00:06:00.635
Right?

00:06:00.635 --> 00:06:06.530
So just do the help and try to use

00:06:06.530 --> 00:06:09.110
as much as possible because we had to try with

00:06:09.110 --> 00:06:12.485
a different help operations like we try to exit.

00:06:12.485 --> 00:06:13.520
No, we didn't try to exit.

00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:16.190
We tried to import list vast methods because I

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:19.820
didn't try any methods tell now because they're gonna do it in the next video.

00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:23.825
So we know how to close the id.

00:06:23.825 --> 00:06:25.805
I mean, the JCL, right?

00:06:25.805 --> 00:06:30.690
Let's do everything started the slash, Exit.

00:06:30.970 --> 00:06:35.870
Goodbye. So these are

00:06:35.870 --> 00:06:43.115
the things which you can make use of as a part of help documentation.

00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:45.170
You can tell them that documentation or help.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:46.505
That's all.

00:06:46.505 --> 00:06:48.380
In the next video, we will discuss it,

00:06:48.380 --> 00:06:51.005
but even further about Jason

00:06:51.005 --> 00:06:54.140
and the methods is going to work and how variables is going to work.

00:06:54.140 --> 00:06:56.195
And now I'm going to create a classes.

00:06:56.195 --> 00:07:00.485
And our moody edit it. Right?

00:07:00.485 --> 00:07:01.460
Thank you.

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.840
We'll see you next video.
