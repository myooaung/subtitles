00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.745
Hello everyone. Welcome back.

00:00:02.745 --> 00:00:05.100
Okay, let's start with a simple example.

00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.110
So let me create a list of string which contains some names.

00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:21.930
List. And then, so the matter is you're going to use a list of matter, right?

00:00:21.930 --> 00:00:23.460
So you can pass the number of elements,

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:25.545
you can add one or two or whatever you want.

00:00:25.545 --> 00:00:30.405
So Adam and Sam,

00:00:30.405 --> 00:00:34.620
and I'm going to pass and CSR.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:37.260
So this is a simple list,

00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:41.810
but I never mentioned anywhere it is going to be on modifiable collection.

00:00:41.810 --> 00:00:43.910
The reason is the outmoded itself,

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:46.685
it's creating an unmodified collection.

00:00:46.685 --> 00:00:49.310
So you don't have to specify it like how we are doing it in

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:57.870
Java 8 is print the names here and we'll see the outcome of it.

00:00:58.180 --> 00:01:00.530
Just run it.

00:01:00.530 --> 00:01:04.580
We should be able to see Adam, Sam, and Nancy.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.395
This is pretty good too, right?

00:01:06.395 --> 00:01:08.150
So what is the adder scenario here?

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:11.240
So what will happen in case if I'm trying to add

00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:15.930
another value somewhere here or in the element,

00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:18.845
that is possible, right?

00:01:18.845 --> 00:01:20.330
So when you create a modern,

00:01:20.330 --> 00:01:25.195
unmodified able collection, make sure we will have a proper data.

00:01:25.195 --> 00:01:29.020
Make sure you'll have no null in it. Just run it.

00:01:29.020 --> 00:01:34.120
Now. This is what we discussed when it is an allele available in Iran multivariable,

00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:38.125
it will throw an error saying NullPointerException.

00:01:38.125 --> 00:01:40.345
Okay, Got it. Okay.

00:01:40.345 --> 00:01:45.970
So I have a list and I tried to add another value and I found out,

00:01:45.970 --> 00:01:47.395
okay, this is going to happen.

00:01:47.395 --> 00:01:50.665
So then the animal, it's going to be true a NullPointerException.

00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:56.630
What if I'm trying to add some names?

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.830
Here? I'm going to add bottle.

00:01:59.830 --> 00:02:05.050
And it won't draw any compelled ME error.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.030
Okay?

00:02:06.030 --> 00:02:08.870
It will throw an error only on the runtime.

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:17.300
So let's run it and we'll see can you see what is happening here?

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.950
Unsupported exception, that means it is telling us

00:02:21.950 --> 00:02:26.960
like adding an element into modifiable list.

00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.980
It is stricter and you are not supposed to add anything or

00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:35.030
modify anything into a existing unmodified list.

00:02:35.030 --> 00:02:43.385
For that is an important thing between it and the list dot, dot.

00:02:43.385 --> 00:02:46.055
So how many are going to pass it?

00:02:46.055 --> 00:02:51.275
It's totally still depends on each and every individual's.

00:02:51.275 --> 00:02:54.410
Because there are some now as I can,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:58.010
but only one or two and sometimes three or four at the MAX.

00:02:58.010 --> 00:03:04.010
10 better citizen, we have only 10 meters off of that AS possible scenarios,

00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:06.230
we might have a lot of n number of elements.

00:03:06.230 --> 00:03:13.535
So we have an altimeter which will accept n number of inputs in it, right?

00:03:13.535 --> 00:03:17.135
Okay, so we know how the list is going to work and we know,

00:03:17.135 --> 00:03:19.445
okay, Did you try to add some Boolean value?

00:03:19.445 --> 00:03:20.540
No, I haven't tried it.

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:21.755
Okay, let's do that.

00:03:21.755 --> 00:03:25.700
Let's try to add atom here, and let's run it.

00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.470
And I'm going to comment this one. And it again.

00:03:30.470 --> 00:03:34.220
So that is no issue here because this,

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:40.445
this collection is a list and which will allow duplicate value in it.

00:03:40.445 --> 00:03:41.570
Right?

00:03:41.570 --> 00:03:46.280
So Adam, Sam, and then t. But just take a look at the audit,

00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:48.710
how it is printing ad and Sam nans in atom,

00:03:48.710 --> 00:03:52.580
it is maintaining the order of insertion.

00:03:52.580 --> 00:03:54.380
Right?

00:03:54.380 --> 00:03:58.054
So next, let's take an example.

00:03:58.054 --> 00:04:02.030
For a set. I'm going to copy same thing.

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:04.980
Let me come on this one for now.

00:04:07.450 --> 00:04:13.139
So I'm going to use say in this scenario.

00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.570
So input the set. So now what happened here?

00:04:19.570 --> 00:04:22.840
Cannot list of string into set of string.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:26.335
So what the problem, some music list of.

00:04:26.335 --> 00:04:30.190
Now it's supposed to be set of metadata.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:31.405
Right?

00:04:31.405 --> 00:04:35.290
Let's print the data in it.

00:04:35.290 --> 00:04:37.519
Names.

00:04:38.490 --> 00:04:42.370
By now, you could have guessed it what's going to happen because I have

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.820
a duplicate value and set this nevertheless to WWE,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.230
right? So what will happen?

00:04:49.890 --> 00:04:55.185
Illegal argument exception, duplicate value, atom.

00:04:55.185 --> 00:04:58.460
So the similar way when you're using

00:04:58.460 --> 00:05:02.210
list or creating a non-modifiable list to our collection rate,

00:05:02.210 --> 00:05:04.010
we should not have a null value.

00:05:04.010 --> 00:05:07.145
The similar, similar way you're going for a set,

00:05:07.145 --> 00:05:11.810
make sure you will not have duplicates because set will not allow duplicates.

00:05:11.810 --> 00:05:16.460
So let's remove it. And then I'm going to print again.

00:05:16.460 --> 00:05:18.680
So now it is fine.

00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:21.780
Let me try to add some hair.

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:26.910
Try to modify it. Let's see what's going to happen.

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:29.315
Disseminating it's going to happen.

00:05:29.315 --> 00:05:31.205
Unsupported operation.

00:05:31.205 --> 00:05:33.215
A galaxy is locked,

00:05:33.215 --> 00:05:36.860
it is not allowed to update. Right?

00:05:36.860 --> 00:05:40.560
And let's try the analog phone.

00:05:41.020 --> 00:05:44.400
And let me come on this one.

00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:53.315
C is not allowed in the unmotivated collection, right?

00:05:53.315 --> 00:05:57.395
So this is simple example for list and set.

00:05:57.395 --> 00:06:04.290
In the next video, let's talk about how we are going to create a map with the off method.
