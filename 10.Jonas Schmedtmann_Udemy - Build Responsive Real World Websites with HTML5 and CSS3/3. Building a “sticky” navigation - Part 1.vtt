00:00:00.884  -->  00:00:03.740 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Hi. In this lecture we'll start to get our</v>
2

2

00:00:03.740  -->  00:00:06.434 line:15% 
hands dirty with jQuery.
3

3

00:00:06.434  -->  00:00:07.267 line:15% 
We're going to build
4

4

00:00:07.267  -->  00:00:10.985 line:15% 
a very simple so called sticky navigation.
5

5

00:00:10.985  -->  00:00:15.152 line:15% 
And this is great to show you the very basics of jQuery.
6

6

00:00:16.650  -->  00:00:21.380
So I will start off by showing you what we want to achieve.
7

7

00:00:21.380  -->  00:00:25.745
So here in the normal state we want the navigation to show
8

8

00:00:25.745  -->  00:00:28.544
in a normal way so here in the header.
9

9

00:00:28.544  -->  00:00:33.347
But then as we go down here we don't want this to happen.
10

10

00:00:33.347  -->  00:00:36.598
So we want our navigation to show up here.
11

11

00:00:36.598  -->  00:00:39.291
With this little effect.
12

12

00:00:39.291  -->  00:00:42.356
So that we can see the navigation always
13

13

00:00:42.356  -->  00:00:44.609
and not just when we're in the header.
14

14

00:00:44.609  -->  00:00:47.395
And then as we go back to the header,
15

15

00:00:47.395  -->  00:00:50.437
then the navigation disappears.
16

16

00:00:50.437  -->  00:00:52.829
So I'll show you again.
17

17

00:00:52.829  -->  00:00:56.996
So navigation comes in once we get passed the header.
18

18

00:00:59.330  -->  00:01:03.603
So we will use jQuery to add a class to the north element
19

19

00:01:03.603  -->  00:01:06.134
every time we leave the header.
20

20

00:01:06.134  -->  00:01:07.967
So at this point here.
21

21

00:01:09.663  -->  00:01:12.774
So the first thing we need to do in order to do that
22

22

00:01:12.774  -->  00:01:16.941
is to actually format this navigation in the sticky state.
23

23

00:01:19.206  -->  00:01:20.289
Let's say so.
24

24

00:01:21.319  -->  00:01:24.069
So this is the sticky navigation.
25

25

00:01:25.197  -->  00:01:27.612
So, here is the north element
26

26

00:01:27.612  -->  00:01:29.622
and this is where we will use jQuery
27

27

00:01:29.622  -->  00:01:31.622
to add the sticky class.
28

28

00:01:32.776  -->  00:01:36.943
So lets go to our CSS file and start by defining that class.
29

29

00:01:38.698  -->  00:01:42.281
So where's the navigation, okay here it is.
30

30

00:01:43.519  -->  00:01:46.269
Let me just leave some comment here.
31

31

00:01:46.269  -->  00:01:50.403
So in fact your going to learn some more CSS here.
32

32

00:01:50.403  -->  00:01:53.096
Maybe more CSS than jQuery,
33

33

00:01:53.096  -->  00:01:57.263
but you know we always use a mixture of both languages.
34

34

00:01:58.878  -->  00:02:00.961
So this is the main navi.
35

35

00:02:02.291  -->  00:02:06.041
And down here we will now do the sticky navi.
36

36

00:02:12.415  -->  00:02:14.332
So just a simple class.
37

37

00:02:15.596  -->  00:02:20.054
In fact I will now just for testing purposes
38

38

00:02:20.054  -->  00:02:23.221
add this class here so that we can see
39

39

00:02:25.227  -->  00:02:27.560
what we're styling actually.
40

40

00:02:29.064  -->  00:02:33.231
And the first thing we need to do is define this position.
41

41

00:02:34.335  -->  00:02:37.864
So far we've had absolute and relative positioning, right?
42

42

00:02:37.864  -->  00:02:41.626
And now you get to learn a new one which is fixed.
43

43

00:02:41.626  -->  00:02:44.877
And with this property the navigation stays always
44

44

00:02:44.877  -->  00:02:48.877
at the same point irrespective of our scrolling.
45

45

00:02:51.657  -->  00:02:54.740
And we want this to start at the top,
46

46

00:02:56.589  -->  00:02:58.049
and on the left corner.
47

47

00:02:58.049  -->  00:02:59.182
So the top left corner.
48

48

00:02:59.182  -->  00:03:02.976
So we have to define top zero, and left zero.
49

49

00:03:02.976  -->  00:03:06.877
And we want it to be 100 percent wide.
50

50

00:03:06.877  -->  00:03:10.894
So as you saw in that image I showed you before.
51

51

00:03:10.894  -->  00:03:14.795
We want it to occupy the whole browser width.
52

52

00:03:14.795  -->  00:03:17.070
And we want it to be wide.
53

53

00:03:17.070  -->  00:03:18.903
So background color...
54

54

00:03:22.341  -->  00:03:23.174
color...
55

55

00:03:24.335  -->  00:03:25.168
white,
56

56

00:03:26.054  -->  00:03:28.956
but with a little transparency.
57

57

00:03:28.956  -->  00:03:32.764
So that we can see the content beneath it.
58

58

00:03:32.764  -->  00:03:34.431
I'll start with 098.
59

59

00:03:35.829  -->  00:03:37.996
This is almost no opacity.
60

60

00:03:39.484  -->  00:03:41.597
Now let's have a look at this.
61

61

00:03:41.597  -->  00:03:44.764
Have to open our live connection here.
62

62

00:03:48.948  -->  00:03:51.488
Alright, this is how it looks like so far.
63

63

00:03:51.488  -->  00:03:55.528
And we can barely see these links here,
64

64

00:03:55.528  -->  00:03:56.596
but they are there.
65

65

00:03:56.596  -->  00:03:59.535
But of course with the white color we defined before.
66

66

00:03:59.535  -->  00:04:02.948
And the logo is here, so everything is here.
67

67

00:04:02.948  -->  00:04:06.106
But now we need to style this.
68

68

00:04:06.106  -->  00:04:09.523
But in fact it's already a sticky, right?
69

69

00:04:11.029  -->  00:04:13.639
So let's change a couple of things here.
70

70

00:04:13.639  -->  00:04:17.806
And I will start off by changing those things here.
71

71

00:04:20.118  -->  00:04:21.668
So the first thing is we want to change
72

72

00:04:21.668  -->  00:04:23.763
some of these things.
73

73

00:04:23.763  -->  00:04:27.930
So I will copy everything then delete things I don't want.
74

74

00:04:30.095  -->  00:04:32.095
And now I have to say...
75

75

00:04:33.903  -->  00:04:37.061
sticky and here the same thing.
76

76

00:04:37.061  -->  00:04:40.478
Because I want these styles to apply only
77

77

00:04:44.561  -->  00:04:48.648
if this class is inside of the sticky class.
78

78

00:04:48.648  -->  00:04:51.550
Right, so this is then the sticky class.
79

79

00:04:51.550  -->  00:04:55.717
And then we have the main nav inside of the sticky class.
80

80

00:04:59.283  -->  00:05:01.605
Alright, so the first thing we should
81

81

00:05:01.605  -->  00:05:04.188
definitely change is the color.
82

82

00:05:06.388  -->  00:05:10.555
Lets set it to 555 , such as the rest of the webpage.
83

83

00:05:12.077  -->  00:05:14.577
And we don't need any of this.
84

84

00:05:16.651  -->  00:05:18.486
And depending I will leave this for now.
85

85

00:05:18.486  -->  00:05:21.236
We can take a look at that later.
86

86

00:05:23.756  -->  00:05:27.756
Alright, so it is now at least it's visible now.
87

87

00:05:30.026  -->  00:05:33.197
And now we have a problem here with the image, the logo.
88

88

00:05:33.197  -->  00:05:34.973
Because it is the white logo,
89

89

00:05:34.973  -->  00:05:37.481
and we want the black logo here.
90

90

00:05:37.481  -->  00:05:40.244
So what can we do about that?
91

91

00:05:40.244  -->  00:05:45.051
The simplest way would be to go back to the HTML file
92

92

00:05:45.051  -->  00:05:49.218
and include the black logo in the exact same place.
93

93

00:05:50.275  -->  00:05:52.099
And I will duplicate this line.
94

94

00:05:52.099  -->  00:05:55.025
And I will explain you what I am doing here in a second.
95

95

00:05:55.025  -->  00:05:56.692
So now I want this..
96

96

00:05:59.458  -->  00:06:01.541
class to call logo black.
97

97

00:06:04.754  -->  00:06:08.148
And this one will be the black logo.
98

98

00:06:08.148  -->  00:06:10.648
Let me see how this is called,
99

99

00:06:12.438  -->  00:06:14.188
so this is just logo.
100

100

00:06:15.108  -->  00:06:18.441
Alright, so remember this is logo black.
101

101

00:06:22.213  -->  00:06:24.380
I need now to format that.
102

102

00:06:27.786  -->  00:06:30.712
Easiest way is to make control F or command F,
103

103

00:06:30.712  -->  00:06:33.379
and then search for logo simply.
104

104

00:06:35.634  -->  00:06:39.801
And let me style logo black in the exact same way.
105

105

00:06:43.436  -->  00:06:45.573
But with one difference.
106

106

00:06:45.573  -->  00:06:48.156
I want logo black to be hidden.
107

107

00:06:51.006  -->  00:06:53.173
And so I say display none.
108

108

00:06:57.531  -->  00:07:00.948
So this image will then be not displayed.
109

109

00:07:01.791  -->  00:07:05.124
So I Incorporated, but it is not visible
110

110

00:07:07.652  -->  00:07:09.319
in the normal state.
111

111

00:07:11.832  -->  00:07:15.999
And what I am going to do now, is to go back to our
112

112

00:07:18.496  -->  00:07:22.663
navigation and define that if the logo black is inside
113

113

00:07:27.436  -->  00:07:31.603
of the sticky navigation then it shall display as a block.
114

114

00:07:34.750  -->  00:07:36.569
So it will no longer be hidden.
115

115

00:07:36.569  -->  00:07:38.148
Let's see if it works.
116

116

00:07:38.148  -->  00:07:39.378
Okay here it is,
117

117

00:07:39.378  -->  00:07:43.545
and all we have to do is to hide the white logo, right?
118

118

00:07:46.391  -->  00:07:50.558
So again now if the logo is inside of the sticky navigation
119

119

00:07:54.053  -->  00:07:58.349
then this one will be hidden by saying display none.
120

120

00:07:58.349  -->  00:07:59.849
Pretty easy right?
121

121

00:08:01.934  -->  00:08:04.267
So let's see how this works,
122

122

00:08:06.323  -->  00:08:07.716
and yeah great.
123

123

00:08:07.716  -->  00:08:09.204
So what can be change now?
124

124

00:08:09.204  -->  00:08:12.117
Now we want to reduce this space here.
125

125

00:08:12.117  -->  00:08:15.693
Between all of this and make the image smaller
126

126

00:08:15.693  -->  00:08:17.943
so that we can reduce this.
127

127

00:08:21.405  -->  00:08:24.748
So let me see the original version,
128

128

00:08:24.748  -->  00:08:26.165
and okay here we have it.
129

129

00:08:26.165  -->  00:08:30.332
So the margin top is 55 pixels, which is way too much.
130

130

00:08:31.575  -->  00:08:34.242
So I'm going to copy this again,
131

131

00:08:35.778  -->  00:08:38.945
and just change what I want to change.
132

132

00:08:40.724  -->  00:08:44.474
And I will say maybe 15 pixels to start with.
133

133

00:08:53.286  -->  00:08:55.036
Okay much better now.
134

134

00:08:57.233  -->  00:08:58.626
Yeah this is much better.
135

135

00:08:58.626  -->  00:09:02.709
Now I also want to decrease this logo here right.
136

136

00:09:06.614  -->  00:09:08.584
Again I'm gonna search for it.
137

137

00:09:08.584  -->  00:09:09.501
Logo black.
138

138

00:09:14.621  -->  00:09:17.802
Actually we shouldn't put this here
139

139

00:09:17.802  -->  00:09:21.135
because those styles are very different.
140

140

00:09:23.445  -->  00:09:25.945
So let me define it like this.
141

141

00:09:33.777  -->  00:09:37.111
And here I will say 50 pixels should be enough.
142

142

00:09:37.111  -->  00:09:40.778
And here I want just five pixels to the top.
143

143

00:09:42.149  -->  00:09:46.213
So let me take a look at this, and here we go.
144

144

00:09:46.213  -->  00:09:48.326
So much smaller now,
145

145

00:09:48.326  -->  00:09:52.493
and now we maybe need some margin to the bottom as well.
146

146

00:09:53.365  -->  00:09:55.501
And then what we want to change here
147

147

00:09:55.501  -->  00:09:59.668
is to make this little line here to be all the way down here
148

148

00:10:00.901  -->  00:10:02.977
to the white border.
149

149

00:10:02.977  -->  00:10:06.144
To the border of this white container.
150

150

00:10:07.017  -->  00:10:11.684
And then I also want some shadow here so that we can
151

151

00:10:11.684  -->  00:10:14.540
differentiate between this section
152

152

00:10:14.540  -->  00:10:16.873
and the rest of the website.
153

153

00:10:19.254  -->  00:10:21.529
Okay now, three things to do.
154

154

00:10:21.529  -->  00:10:22.992
So here I want the margin top
155

155

00:10:22.992  -->  00:10:25.291
and the margin bottom to be five.
156

156

00:10:25.291  -->  00:10:28.708
So I just say margin, and five, and zero.
157

157

00:10:29.656  -->  00:10:31.689
So as you remember this means five at the top
158

158

00:10:31.689  -->  00:10:34.058
and five at the bottom.
159

159

00:10:34.058  -->  00:10:37.475
Now let's go back to the navigation here.
160

160

00:10:40.350  -->  00:10:44.809
Alright, and in order to increase the spacing between
161

161

00:10:44.809  -->  00:10:49.581
that orange line and the text of the navigation links,
162

162

00:10:49.581  -->  00:10:52.298
is to increase this painting.
163

163

00:10:52.298  -->  00:10:55.048
Start by setting it to 15 pixels.
164

164

00:10:56.988  -->  00:11:01.155
And now as I said I want some shadow here on this container.
165

165

00:11:02.213  -->  00:11:06.296
So let's say box shadow and we already used that.
166

166

00:11:07.414  -->  00:11:09.664
So it's zero on the X axis,
167

167

00:11:12.675  -->  00:11:15.182
so in the horizontal.
168

168

00:11:15.182  -->  00:11:17.876
Then two pixels in the Y axis,
169

169

00:11:17.876  -->  00:11:19.459
so in the vertical.
170

170

00:11:20.500  -->  00:11:22.961
And I want two pixels blur.
171

171

00:11:22.961  -->  00:11:24.889
And now the color again.
172

172

00:11:24.889  -->  00:11:28.255
Let's say we want a very subtle gray here.
173

173

00:11:28.255  -->  00:11:30.693
So let's start with white here again,
174

174

00:11:30.693  -->  00:11:34.860
and then use the color picker to choose something else.
175

175

00:11:37.056  -->  00:11:38.556
This for instance.
176

176

00:11:41.235  -->  00:11:44.579
Alright, so this looks good here.
177

177

00:11:44.579  -->  00:11:45.412
The image.
178

178

00:11:46.553  -->  00:11:49.571
Now we need some more margin between this and the top
179

179

00:11:49.571  -->  00:11:51.777
in order to make it centered.
180

180

00:11:51.777  -->  00:11:52.610
Right?
181

181

00:11:55.167  -->  00:11:57.048
So how do we do that?
182

182

00:11:57.048  -->  00:12:00.368
We need some more margin here, let's say 18.
183

183

00:12:00.368  -->  00:12:05.184
And then we can increase the painting here to, let's say 16.
184

184

00:12:05.184  -->  00:12:08.851
Now it's just you know testing how it works.
185

185

00:12:11.375  -->  00:12:14.125
Get rid of those blue boxes here.
186

186

00:12:15.345  -->  00:12:19.512
Alright, I think that we already have here what we want.
187

187

00:12:21.545  -->  00:12:23.545
And this is cool, right?
188

188

00:12:24.424  -->  00:12:27.025
So we have styled this whole thing,
189

189

00:12:27.025  -->  00:12:29.115
and now we can use J Query
190

190

00:12:29.115  -->  00:12:33.039
to have that effect that I described before.
191

191

00:12:33.039  -->  00:12:35.663
And I will actually leave that for the next lecture,
192

192

00:12:35.663  -->  00:12:37.845
so that you can take a break if you want.
193

193

00:12:37.845  -->  00:12:41.909
And review the code that we written so far.
194

194

00:12:41.909  -->  00:12:45.044
So you can do that or you can just come with me,
195

195

00:12:45.044  -->  00:12:47.627
and start to write some jQuery.
