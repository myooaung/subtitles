00:00:01.981  -->  00:00:03.227
<v Voiceover>In the last lecture,</v>
2

2

00:00:03.227  -->  00:00:04.586
we created the basic structure
3

3

00:00:04.586  -->  00:00:08.753
of our first HTML document using the head and body element.
4

4

00:00:09.638  -->  00:00:14.155
Now, let's start to fill it with some content.
5

5

00:00:14.155  -->  00:00:16.751
Now, back to our webpage.
6

6

00:00:16.751  -->  00:00:18.590
In the head of the webpage,
7

7

00:00:18.590  -->  00:00:21.536
let's just give our webpage a title for now.
8

8

00:00:21.536  -->  00:00:24.869
For that, I'm gonna use the &lt;title&gt; tag.
9

9

00:00:26.517  -->  00:00:27.350
Title.
10

10

00:00:28.267  -->  00:00:30.575
And write something like...
11

11

00:00:30.575  -->  00:00:31.492
my first...
12

12

00:00:32.590  -->  00:00:34.393
blog post...
13

13

00:00:34.393  -->  00:00:35.226
in here.
14

14

00:00:37.186  -->  00:00:38.457
And now for the body.
15

15

00:00:38.457  -->  00:00:40.526
Let's start with some text.
16

16

00:00:40.526  -->  00:00:44.843
HTML has text for headings starting with the &lt;h1&gt; element
17

17

00:00:44.843  -->  00:00:45.876
for the main headings,
18

18

00:00:45.876  -->  00:00:50.043
all the way down to &lt;h6&gt; for less important headings.
19

19

00:00:51.424  -->  00:00:52.257
So, I'm...
20

20

00:00:53.207  -->  00:00:55.124
going to use an &lt;h1&gt;...
21

21

00:00:56.003  -->  00:00:57.608
element here.
22

22

00:00:57.608  -->  00:01:00.507
And let's just repeat the text from the title,
23

23

00:01:00.507  -->  00:01:01.353
My
24

24

00:01:01.353  -->  00:01:02.186
first
25

25

00:01:02.186  -->  00:01:03.019
blog
26

26

00:01:03.019  -->  00:01:03.852
post.
27

27

00:01:04.746  -->  00:01:06.125
Alright.
28

28

00:01:06.125  -->  00:01:10.817
Now, Do you want to see what this looks like in a browser?
29

29

00:01:10.817  -->  00:01:14.685
There, a bracket string comes in again.
30

30

00:01:14.685  -->  00:01:16.385
One great feature of this editor
31

31

00:01:16.385  -->  00:01:18.968
is this so-called Live Preview.
32

32

00:01:20.373  -->  00:01:22.480
So, when I hit this button here,
33

33

00:01:22.480  -->  00:01:24.667
it opens a new browser window
34

34

00:01:24.667  -->  00:01:27.348
with a live connection...
35

35

00:01:27.348  -->  00:01:30.087
between our code and the browser.
36

36

00:01:30.087  -->  00:01:32.240
So that we can see all the changes we make
37

37

00:01:32.240  -->  00:01:36.407
in our code being immediately rendered by the browser.
38

38

00:01:38.161  -->  00:01:41.037
So, then I go back to Brackets.
39

39

00:01:41.037  -->  00:01:43.779
We see now that this symbol here has changed its color
40

40

00:01:43.779  -->  00:01:48.023
to orange, which means that the connection is now live.
41

41

00:01:48.023  -->  00:01:51.492
I will these two windows side by side.
42

42

00:01:51.492  -->  00:01:54.882
So, the Brackets editor on this side,
43

43

00:01:54.882  -->  00:01:57.778
and the Google Chrome window on this side.
44

44

00:01:57.778  -->  00:02:01.376
So, we can see our changes immediately.
45

45

00:02:01.376  -->  00:02:04.253
Now, I think this only works with Google Chrome, though.
46

46

00:02:04.253  -->  00:02:06.309
If you prefer to use another browser,
47

47

00:02:06.309  -->  00:02:08.559
let's say Firefox or Safari
48

48

00:02:09.828  -->  00:02:12.090
or even Internet Explorer,
49

49

00:02:12.090  -->  00:02:14.204
you can totally do that.
50

50

00:02:14.204  -->  00:02:17.952
In that case, you gotta open the HTML file we created,
51

51

00:02:17.952  -->  00:02:20.416
right from the Blog Post folder,
52

52

00:02:20.416  -->  00:02:22.618
and then hit the reload button each time you want
53

53

00:02:22.618  -->  00:02:25.868
to see the changes we made in the code.
54

54

00:02:28.132  -->  00:02:30.769
So, this is what an &lt;h1&gt; element looks like
55

55

00:02:30.769  -->  00:02:33.535
in a browser without any styling.
56

56

00:02:33.535  -->  00:02:36.037
Also, notice how the title that we defined
57

57

00:02:36.037  -->  00:02:40.726
for our webpage displays in the Google Chrome tab.
58

58

00:02:40.726  -->  00:02:44.460
Let's continue with some secondary headings now,
59

59

00:02:44.460  -->  00:02:47.141
which are, as you may guess,
60

60

00:02:47.141  -->  00:02:48.308
&lt;h2&gt; elements.
61

61

00:02:50.364  -->  00:02:51.811
Okay.
62

62

00:02:51.811  -->  00:02:54.274
I'll write something like,
63

63

00:02:54.274  -->  00:02:55.107
This is my
64

64

00:02:56.291  -->  00:02:57.342
first
65

65

00:02:57.342  -->  00:02:58.175
blog...
66

66

00:02:59.452  -->  00:03:00.285
blog post.
67

67

00:03:01.564  -->  00:03:04.408
And you see, like magic, that text appears
68

68

00:03:04.408  -->  00:03:07.158
on the right side in the browser.
69

69

00:03:09.318  -->  00:03:12.471
And, since it's so fun, let's add another one.
70

70

00:03:12.471  -->  00:03:14.016
Right here.
71

71

00:03:14.016  -->  00:03:15.295
Let's say...
72

72

00:03:15.295  -->  00:03:16.636
H...
73

73

00:03:16.636  -->  00:03:17.469
HTML is...
74

74

00:03:18.357  -->  00:03:19.190
amazing.
75

75

00:03:21.995  -->  00:03:22.995
Ah-may-zing.
76

76

00:03:24.317  -->  00:03:25.150
Okay.
77

77

00:03:25.150  -->  00:03:28.527
Now, it's time for some paragraphs.
78

78

00:03:28.527  -->  00:03:31.944
Paragraphs are elements for larger texts.
79

79

00:03:35.275  -->  00:03:37.775
And we use 'em just like this.
80

80

00:03:39.242  -->  00:03:42.181
Now, we need some text for these paragraphs.
81

81

00:03:42.181  -->  00:03:45.028
So, let's just go to Google Chrome
82

82

00:03:45.028  -->  00:03:47.361
and look for some blindtext.
83

83

00:03:53.507  -->  00:03:54.951
So, blindtext is commonly used
84

84

00:03:54.951  -->  00:03:59.520
if we don't have any real text for a webpage.
85

85

00:03:59.520  -->  00:04:03.687
I'm just gonna copy all of this and paste it right here.
86

86

00:04:05.127  -->  00:04:06.877
That's a lot of text.
87

87

00:04:10.594  -->  00:04:11.594
Cut it here.
88

88

00:04:13.477  -->  00:04:14.861
So it's not so much.
89

89

00:04:14.861  -->  00:04:16.424
'Kay, we can close this.
90

90

00:04:16.424  -->  00:04:17.331
And, alright.
91

91

00:04:17.331  -->  00:04:20.339
Here, we have a paragraph with some nice text in it.
92

92

00:04:20.339  -->  00:04:24.506
Now, I will just make the same thing for the other
93

93

00:04:26.372  -->  00:04:28.955
paragraph I want below this h2.
94

94

00:04:30.211  -->  00:04:34.212
And now, we see we have two paragraphs here.
95

95

00:04:34.212  -->  00:04:36.647
Now, suppose you want to apply some basic formatting
96

96

00:04:36.647  -->  00:04:38.302
to the text.
97

97

00:04:38.302  -->  00:04:39.581
Do you want to see how?
98

98

00:04:39.581  -->  00:04:41.325
Alright, let's do it.
99

99

00:04:41.325  -->  00:04:45.492
I'm gonna start with bold text using the &lt;strong&gt; tag.
100

100

00:04:50.524  -->  00:04:51.732
Like...
101

101

00:04:51.732  -->  00:04:52.732
this is a...
102

102

00:04:53.638  -->  00:04:54.471
very.
103

103

00:04:56.734  -->  00:04:58.373
Now, I use the &lt;strong&gt; element.
104

104

00:04:58.373  -->  00:04:59.948
And close it.
105

105

00:04:59.948  -->  00:05:02.031
And now the word: strong.
106

106

00:05:05.239  -->  00:05:06.072
Text...
107

107

00:05:06.929  -->  00:05:07.762
because
108

108

00:05:07.762  -->  00:05:08.595
it is...
109

109

00:05:11.001  -->  00:05:11.834
Strong.
110

110

00:05:13.045  -->  00:05:15.132
Well, because it is bold, actually.
111

111

00:05:15.132  -->  00:05:17.729
Just some random text.
112

112

00:05:17.729  -->  00:05:20.312
Just so you see how this works.
113

113

00:05:21.483  -->  00:05:24.233
So, these two words are bold now.
114

114

00:05:26.405  -->  00:05:28.983
And now, some italics,
115

115

00:05:28.983  -->  00:05:31.272
for which we use the &lt;em&gt; tag,
116

116

00:05:31.272  -->  00:05:33.439
which stands for emphasis.
117

117

00:05:34.423  -->  00:05:36.860
So, again some random text,
118

118

00:05:36.860  -->  00:05:37.693
I would...
119

119

00:05:39.136  -->  00:05:40.707
like...
120

120

00:05:40.707  -->  00:05:41.540
to.
121

121

00:05:42.616  -->  00:05:44.880
Now, the &lt;em&gt; element.
122

122

00:05:44.880  -->  00:05:45.880
Emphasize...
123

123

00:05:51.726  -->  00:05:52.805
how
124

124

00:05:52.805  -->  00:05:54.376
important
125

125

00:05:54.376  -->  00:05:55.977
it is...
126

126

00:05:55.977  -->  00:05:56.977
to follow...
127

127

00:05:58.316  -->  00:05:59.483
this course...
128

128

00:06:02.280  -->  00:06:03.447
until the end!
129

129

00:06:05.446  -->  00:06:07.277
Okay, and now we have...
130

130

00:06:07.277  -->  00:06:08.610
the emphasize...
131

131

00:06:09.511  -->  00:06:10.814
word
132

132

00:06:10.814  -->  00:06:14.231
actually emphasize with the &lt;em&gt; element.
133

133

00:06:17.670  -->  00:06:22.294
At last, some underline text using the &lt;u&gt; tag.
134

134

00:06:22.294  -->  00:06:24.580
Which, you should actually not use on a real website,
135

135

00:06:24.580  -->  00:06:27.865
but I will show it to you anyway.
136

136

00:06:27.865  -->  00:06:29.448
So, there's some...
137

137

00:06:32.277  -->  00:06:33.360
Underlined...
138

138

00:06:35.266  -->  00:06:36.099
text.
139

139

00:06:40.332  -->  00:06:41.165
Okay.
140

140

00:06:41.165  -->  00:06:43.964
Now, see it's underlined here.
141

141

00:06:43.964  -->  00:06:46.714
But, another thing you maybe noticed is
142

142

00:06:46.714  -->  00:06:50.399
that even with all these line breaks I made here,
143

143

00:06:50.399  -->  00:06:52.199
in the HTML document,
144

144

00:06:52.199  -->  00:06:55.282
nothing happened here in the browser.
145

145

00:06:56.574  -->  00:07:00.387
So, in fact, I can do as many as I want here,
146

146

00:07:00.387  -->  00:07:02.112
see, nothing happens.
147

147

00:07:02.112  -->  00:07:04.195
If I want a line break...
148

148

00:07:06.079  -->  00:07:07.467
on my actual website,
149

149

00:07:07.467  -->  00:07:09.899
I have to use the &lt;br&gt; element,
150

150

00:07:09.899  -->  00:07:11.727
which stands for break.
151

151

00:07:11.727  -->  00:07:13.622
Goes like this.
152

152

00:07:13.622  -->  00:07:14.735
Okay.
153

153

00:07:14.735  -->  00:07:17.568
Now, you see the line here breaks.
154

154

00:07:19.970  -->  00:07:23.476
Just to try it, let's put another one here.
155

155

00:07:23.476  -->  00:07:25.062
Again, it worked.
156

156

00:07:25.062  -->  00:07:27.185
And, another one here.
157

157

00:07:27.185  -->  00:07:28.885
So, now we have one line
158

158

00:07:28.885  -->  00:07:32.302
for each of the little sentences I wrote.
159

159

00:07:34.194  -->  00:07:35.538
Congratulations!
160

160

00:07:35.538  -->  00:07:38.850
You've just created your first HTML page.
