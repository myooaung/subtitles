00:00:01.809  -->  00:00:05.559
<v Voiceover>Let's talk about colors in CSS.</v>
2

2

00:00:06.481  -->  00:00:09.916
In CSS, colors are displayed combining red,
3

3

00:00:09.916  -->  00:00:12.412
green, and blue light.
4

4

00:00:12.412  -->  00:00:14.245
This is the RGB model.
5

5

00:00:15.111  -->  00:00:17.903
In the RGB model, each color is defined
6

6

00:00:17.903  -->  00:00:19.641
by a combination of red,
7

7

00:00:19.641  -->  00:00:23.391
green, and blue using a hexadecimal notation.
8

8

00:00:25.207  -->  00:00:27.949
The lowest value for each color is zero,
9

9

00:00:27.949  -->  00:00:30.855
which is zero in hexadecimal,
10

10

00:00:30.855  -->  00:00:33.722
and the highest value is 255,
11

11

00:00:33.722  -->  00:00:35.972
which is ff in hexadecimal.
12

12

00:00:37.404  -->  00:00:39.412
So, for instance,
13

13

00:00:39.412  -->  00:00:41.664
the complete red has ff,
14

14

00:00:41.664  -->  00:00:45.102
which is the highest value in the red channel,
15

15

00:00:45.102  -->  00:00:48.540
and zero in the green and the blue channel.
16

16

00:00:48.540  -->  00:00:51.980
Yellow is a mixture of red and green,
17

17

00:00:51.980  -->  00:00:55.739
so it has ff in the red and in the green channel,
18

18

00:00:55.739  -->  00:00:57.990
but zero in the blue channel.
19

19

00:00:57.990  -->  00:01:00.072
You get the idea, right?
20

20

00:01:00.072  -->  00:01:01.750
You can just pause the video
21

21

00:01:01.750  -->  00:01:03.550
and look at the RGB model
22

22

00:01:03.550  -->  00:01:06.883
if you want to analyze all colors there.
23

23

00:01:08.128  -->  00:01:11.039
So by mixing red, green, and blue together
24

24

00:01:11.039  -->  00:01:14.723
using different values between zero and 255,
25

25

00:01:14.723  -->  00:01:17.806
we can obtain over 16 million colors.
26

26

00:01:19.683  -->  00:01:23.195
For instance, this nice green is represented
27

27

00:01:23.195  -->  00:01:26.028
with this hexadecimal code 1da717.
28

28

00:01:28.921  -->  00:01:31.869
So we have 1d for red, a7 for green,
29

29

00:01:31.869  -->  00:01:33.202
and 17 for blue.
30

30

00:01:34.119  -->  00:01:37.761
Mixing these together makes this nice green.
31

31

00:01:37.761  -->  00:01:39.988
But don't worry so much about these numbers
32

32

00:01:39.988  -->  00:01:42.190
because picking our colors in Brackets
33

33

00:01:42.190  -->  00:01:43.690
will be very easy.
34

34

00:01:45.423  -->  00:01:47.798
And for gray colors, just make red,
35

35

00:01:47.798  -->  00:01:50.744
green, and blue take the same value.
36

36

00:01:50.744  -->  00:01:52.411
For instance, 8b8b8b
37

37

00:01:54.389  -->  00:01:57.705
gives us that first shade of gray we see here.
38

38

00:01:57.705  -->  00:02:01.025
If all six values in a hex code are the same,
39

39

00:02:01.025  -->  00:02:02.025
like 555555,
40

40

00:02:04.382  -->  00:02:06.049
we simply write 555.
41

41

00:02:08.558  -->  00:02:10.642
Now one last thing,
42

42

00:02:10.642  -->  00:02:14.575
CSS colors can also have transparencies.
43

43

00:02:14.575  -->  00:02:17.071
If we want colors for transparencies,
44

44

00:02:17.071  -->  00:02:19.856
we do not use the hexadecimal notation.
45

45

00:02:19.856  -->  00:02:22.391
Instead, we write them like you can see
46

46

00:02:22.391  -->  00:02:24.313
on the green square.
47

47

00:02:24.313  -->  00:02:26.935
This gives us the same green we saw before,
48

48

00:02:26.935  -->  00:02:29.518
but with 75% transparency.
49

49

00:02:31.565  -->  00:02:32.640
So, I will now show you
50

50

00:02:32.640  -->  00:02:35.473
how all of this works in Brackets.
51

51

00:02:36.834  -->  00:02:39.370
Back to the CSS file of our project,
52

52

00:02:39.370  -->  00:02:40.254
let's try to change
53

53

00:02:40.254  -->  00:02:41.971
that green color of the headings
54

54

00:02:41.971  -->  00:02:43.651
we defined before,
55

55

00:02:43.651  -->  00:02:45.205
because we will actually never use
56

56

00:02:45.205  -->  00:02:46.924
color names like green,
57

57

00:02:46.924  -->  00:02:49.424
as we did in the last lecture.
58

58

00:02:50.817  -->  00:02:53.683
So put the cursor here on this color,
59

59

00:02:53.683  -->  00:02:55.812
and then hit Command + E,
60

60

00:02:55.812  -->  00:02:59.175
just as we did before in the HTML file.
61

61

00:02:59.175  -->  00:03:00.157
But this time
62

62

00:03:00.157  -->  00:03:03.349
it's not a CSS editor which comes up,
63

63

00:03:03.349  -->  00:03:05.599
but this nice color picker.
64

64

00:03:07.524  -->  00:03:10.716
So this is a pretty powerful color picker.
65

65

00:03:10.716  -->  00:03:13.951
You can click everywhere around here
66

66

00:03:13.951  -->  00:03:15.618
to choose the color.
67

67

00:03:17.073  -->  00:03:18.714
And you actually can see
68

68

00:03:18.714  -->  00:03:21.631
the color changing in our web page.
69

69

00:03:24.484  -->  00:03:26.817
We can also use these sliders here
70

70

00:03:26.817  -->  00:03:30.234
to change the color hue and transparency.
71

71

00:03:32.054  -->  00:03:34.102
So here I can change the color,
72

72

00:03:34.102  -->  00:03:36.716
if you wanted a yellow color,
73

73

00:03:36.716  -->  00:03:39.211
blue color, I don't know.
74

74

00:03:39.211  -->  00:03:42.294
So we can choose anything right here.
75

75

00:03:43.388  -->  00:03:44.823
And with this slider,
76

76

00:03:44.823  -->  00:03:47.544
we can adjust the transparency.
77

77

00:03:47.544  -->  00:03:49.754
As we saw before,
78

78

00:03:49.754  -->  00:03:52.421
this now has this RGBA notation,
79

79

00:03:53.605  -->  00:03:56.874
and here we have the transparency value.
80

80

00:03:56.874  -->  00:04:00.624
Now I will just put this back up to 100%
81

81

00:04:02.157  -->  00:04:05.104
and change to the hexadecimal notation
82

82

00:04:05.104  -->  00:04:07.187
that I showed you before.
83

83

00:04:09.727  -->  00:04:10.996
So you can play around
84

84

00:04:10.996  -->  00:04:13.453
with these colors as you wish,
85

85

00:04:13.453  -->  00:04:16.084
I will just choose some
86

86

00:04:16.084  -->  00:04:18.417
nice green for our headings.
87

87

00:04:20.024  -->  00:04:22.030
Maybe this one.
88

88

00:04:22.030  -->  00:04:24.030
So now I will close this
89

89

00:04:24.896  -->  00:04:28.371
and now we have a beautiful green color
90

90

00:04:28.371  -->  00:04:30.383
for all our headings.
91

91

00:04:30.383  -->  00:04:31.569
Another thing,
92

92

00:04:31.569  -->  00:04:34.069
I will go to the picker again.
93

93

00:04:35.131  -->  00:04:39.305
Now if we push this all the way to this side,
94

94

00:04:39.305  -->  00:04:42.252
we have actually all the shades of gray,
95

95

00:04:42.252  -->  00:04:45.036
from complete white, which is fff,
96

96

00:04:45.036  -->  00:04:48.369
all the way down to black, which is 000.
97

97

00:04:49.538  -->  00:04:51.871
So if we move up and down here,
98

98

00:04:51.871  -->  00:04:54.121
we can choose a gray color.
99

99

00:04:56.575  -->  00:05:00.380
But as I said, what I want is a green color.
100

100

00:05:00.380  -->  00:05:02.715
So just put it here.
101

101

00:05:02.715  -->  00:05:04.799
And here Bracket even shows us
102

102

00:05:04.799  -->  00:05:07.297
the colors we use the most in our design.
103

103

00:05:07.297  -->  00:05:09.097
This can be pretty useful
104

104

00:05:09.097  -->  00:05:11.347
if you use multiple colors.
105

105

00:05:12.900  -->  00:05:13.733
All right,
106

106

00:05:13.733  -->  00:05:16.137
so let me close this color picker,
107

107

00:05:16.137  -->  00:05:19.499
and I think that's it for now with colors.
108

108

00:05:19.499  -->  00:05:23.761
So now you know how to work with colors in CSS.
109

109

00:05:23.761  -->  00:05:26.094
See you in the next lecture.
