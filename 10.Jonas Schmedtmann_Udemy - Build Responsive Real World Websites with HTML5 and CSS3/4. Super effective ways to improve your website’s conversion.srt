00:00:01,396  -->  00:00:03,965
<v Voiceover>Do you want to sell something on your website?</v>
2

2

00:00:03,965  -->  00:00:07,596
Maybe a digital product like a course, or an e-book,
3

3

00:00:07,596  -->  00:00:09,407
or maybe a subscription plan?
4

4

00:00:09,407  -->  00:00:12,008
Then this is the right lecture for you.
5

5

00:00:12,008  -->  00:00:14,794
I promise you webdesign guidelines in this course,
6

6

00:00:14,794  -->  00:00:16,652
but now you even get some guidelines
7

7

00:00:16,652  -->  00:00:19,787
to actually improve your website conversion rates,
8

8

00:00:19,787  -->  00:00:21,133
on top of that.
9

9

00:00:21,133  -->  00:00:22,133
So let's go.
10

10

00:00:24,198  -->  00:00:27,382
First, you can offer your visitors a free gift
11

11

00:00:27,382  -->  00:00:28,993
in order to build trust,
12

12

00:00:28,993  -->  00:00:32,568
instead of trying to sell anything right away.
13

13

00:00:32,568  -->  00:00:36,144
A very popular choice is to give away an e-book for free,
14

14

00:00:36,144  -->  00:00:38,312
such as this website does.
15

15

00:00:38,312  -->  00:00:40,195
If the user likes your book,
16

16

00:00:40,195  -->  00:00:44,729
he is more likely to buy anything from you after that.
17

17

00:00:44,729  -->  00:00:48,524
Of course, you should have a strong call to action button
18

18

00:00:48,524  -->  00:00:52,436
on your website, where you want your users to click.
19

19

00:00:52,436  -->  00:00:54,827
But instead of showing it just once,
20

20

00:00:54,827  -->  00:00:57,846
you should repeat it in more places on your website.
21

21

00:00:57,846  -->  00:00:59,583
The more often the better,
22

22

00:00:59,583  -->  00:01:03,679
but obviously without spamming and frustrating the user.
23

23

00:01:03,679  -->  00:01:05,490
This website, for example,
24

24

00:01:05,490  -->  00:01:07,580
has the same call to action button
25

25

00:01:07,580  -->  00:01:09,549
here in the middle of this big image
26

26

00:01:09,549  -->  00:01:12,015
and also in the navigation bar.
27

27

00:01:12,015  -->  00:01:13,687
And they probably also have it
28

28

00:01:13,687  -->  00:01:17,046
on the very bottom of the site.
29

29

00:01:17,046  -->  00:01:20,069
Now, assume you have a sign-up form on your website,
30

30

00:01:20,069  -->  00:01:23,821
but how good is a sign-up form if nobody sees it?
31

31

00:01:23,821  -->  00:01:26,106
That's why so many popular websites
32

32

00:01:26,106  -->  00:01:28,399
and blogs use a pop-up box,
33

33

00:01:28,399  -->  00:01:31,442
like the one you see on this website.
34

34

00:01:31,442  -->  00:01:34,332
All this does is to ask for an email address
35

35

00:01:34,332  -->  00:01:37,122
to sign-up for a newsletter.
36

36

00:01:37,122  -->  00:01:38,784
And I know these pop-up boxes
37

37

00:01:38,784  -->  00:01:41,141
can be quite annoying for the user,
38

38

00:01:41,141  -->  00:01:43,030
but they are still so popular
39

39

00:01:43,030  -->  00:01:45,213
because they actually convert so well,
40

40

00:01:45,213  -->  00:01:47,713
which means that they do work.
41

41

00:01:48,719  -->  00:01:49,717
There are many solutions
42

42

00:01:49,717  -->  00:01:53,800
that offer you pop-up boxes, like this, for free.
43

43

00:01:56,010  -->  00:01:57,798
In your call to action button,
44

44

00:01:57,798  -->  00:01:59,098
you need to tell your user
45

45

00:01:59,098  -->  00:02:01,606
the benefit of clicking that button.
46

46

00:02:01,606  -->  00:02:04,067
This is extremely important.
47

47

00:02:04,067  -->  00:02:07,248
This website does a good job doing this.
48

48

00:02:07,248  -->  00:02:09,593
Instead of saying something boring like,
49

49

00:02:09,593  -->  00:02:11,637
'Click Here' or 'Sign-Up',
50

50

00:02:11,637  -->  00:02:15,631
they tell the user he should try the service for free.
51

51

00:02:15,631  -->  00:02:17,334
That works much better.
52

52

00:02:17,334  -->  00:02:19,610
So always use a word which describes
53

53

00:02:19,610  -->  00:02:23,777
the benefit the user will get by clicking a button.
54

54

00:02:25,136  -->  00:02:27,644
If you want your user to sign-up for anything,
55

55

00:02:27,644  -->  00:02:31,230
don't ask him for more information than you need.
56

56

00:02:31,230  -->  00:02:34,759
If you don't need phone numbers, address, or whatever,
57

57

00:02:34,759  -->  00:02:37,430
don't ask them for the information.
58

58

00:02:37,430  -->  00:02:39,464
The user doesn't want to go through
59

59

00:02:39,464  -->  00:02:43,304
too many fields in a form to achieve something.
60

60

00:02:43,304  -->  00:02:47,471
So forms with fewer fields definitely convert better.
61

61

00:02:48,389  -->  00:02:51,043
Social proof is a great persuasion tactic
62

62

00:02:51,043  -->  00:02:54,450
that can really help you increase conversion rates.
63

63

00:02:54,450  -->  00:02:57,283
This can be done in form of customer testimonials,
64

64

00:02:57,283  -->  00:02:58,536
if you have any,
65

65

00:02:58,536  -->  00:03:03,126
or showing that other companies use your product or service.
66

66

00:03:03,126  -->  00:03:05,517
And this tactic is so incredibly effective
67

67

00:03:05,517  -->  00:03:09,279
because customers are actually more likely to trust others
68

68

00:03:09,279  -->  00:03:11,438
than to trust you.
69

69

00:03:11,438  -->  00:03:13,855
So use this whenever you can.
70

70

00:03:15,757  -->  00:03:19,030
Two very effective techniques that you can use
71

71

00:03:19,030  -->  00:03:22,637
is to create urgency and scarcity.
72

72

00:03:22,637  -->  00:03:26,747
Urgency is when a buyer feels like they need to act quickly
73

73

00:03:26,747  -->  00:03:28,349
and it's used in order to make people
74

74

00:03:28,349  -->  00:03:31,182
act now rather than later.
75

75

00:03:31,182  -->  00:03:33,666
The Groupon website does this by saying,
76

76

00:03:33,666  -->  00:03:38,285
'Hey! This deal has limited time remaining. So buy it now.'
77

77

00:03:38,285  -->  00:03:40,537
So you can use words like, 'now', 'hurry',
78

78

00:03:40,537  -->  00:03:44,521
'instant', and 'immediately' in your call to action buttons,
79

79

00:03:44,521  -->  00:03:47,039
in order to make users act.
80

80

00:03:47,039  -->  00:03:49,710
This technique, together with that very big
81

81

00:03:49,710  -->  00:03:53,877
and clear call to action button, is extremely effective.
82

82

00:03:55,654  -->  00:03:59,447
Now, scarcity is the feeling that a product or service
83

83

00:03:59,447  -->  00:04:03,525
is in short supply and about to run out.
84

84

00:04:03,525  -->  00:04:05,688
And when there is less of anything,
85

85

00:04:05,688  -->  00:04:08,345
we actually tend to value it more.
86

86

00:04:08,345  -->  00:04:11,394
So this technique is also used to make the user act
87

87

00:04:11,394  -->  00:04:15,066
and buy something now before it runs out.
88

88

00:04:15,066  -->  00:04:19,409
Amazon does this quite well by saying, as in this example,
89

89

00:04:19,409  -->  00:04:22,659
that there is only one iPhone left in stock.
90

90

00:04:22,659  -->  00:04:26,513
So, urgency and scarcity; use them when you can
91

91

00:04:26,513  -->  00:04:30,346
and your website will probably convert better.
