<v Voiceover>These days big and beautiful images</v>
2

2

00:00:04,041  -->  00:00:06,781
are everywhere in web design.
3

3

00:00:06,781  -->  00:00:09,266
In fact, using large background images
4

4

00:00:09,266  -->  00:00:12,308
can make your website look more attractive
5

5

00:00:12,308  -->  00:00:15,141
and create more user engagement.
6

6

00:00:15,141  -->  00:00:16,952
It has actually been found that
7

7

00:00:16,952  -->  00:00:19,576
image heavy websites convert better.
8

8

00:00:19,576  -->  00:00:21,921
So that's great news.
9

9

00:00:21,921  -->  00:00:25,265
So you totally have to know how to work with images.
10

10

00:00:25,265  -->  00:00:27,842
And with that, I mean that you should learn
11

11

00:00:27,842  -->  00:00:31,093
how to effectively put text over images.
12

12

00:00:31,093  -->  00:00:33,775
There are a few techniques for doing this,
13

13

00:00:33,775  -->  00:00:36,248
and we are going to go through the most important
14

14

00:00:36,248  -->  00:00:38,248
of them in this lecture.
15

15

00:00:39,313  -->  00:00:44,003
First, the easiest way is to put text directly on an image.
16

16

00:00:44,003  -->  00:00:47,138
The problem is that this only works if the image
17

17

00:00:47,138  -->  00:00:50,342
is quite dark and your text is white.
18

18

00:00:50,342  -->  00:00:52,850
Otherwise you will not have enough contrast
19

19

00:00:52,850  -->  00:00:56,170
between your image and your text.
20

20

00:00:56,170  -->  00:00:58,771
And that is exactly what happens in this website.
21

21

00:00:58,771  -->  00:01:01,046
I mean I like the design,
22

22

00:01:01,046  -->  00:01:02,184
but the white text in the headline
23

23

00:01:02,184  -->  00:01:03,926
is quite difficult to read
24

24

00:01:03,926  -->  00:01:07,293
because the image is also quite bright.
25

25

00:01:07,293  -->  00:01:09,963
So I wouldn't encourage you to use this method
26

26

00:01:09,963  -->  00:01:12,633
because it can make text very difficult to read
27

27

00:01:12,633  -->  00:01:15,396
if you don't make it right.
28

28

00:01:15,396  -->  00:01:18,787
The easiest solution to this problem we saw before
29

29

00:01:18,787  -->  00:01:21,550
is to overlay the image with a color.
30

30

00:01:21,550  -->  00:01:25,729
The most usual and over course simple to use color is black.
31

31

00:01:25,729  -->  00:01:27,494
Which simply turns the image darker,
32

32

00:01:27,494  -->  00:01:31,093
as in these two beautiful websites.
33

33

00:01:31,093  -->  00:01:33,972
But we can also use other colors as well,
34

34

00:01:33,972  -->  00:01:36,968
and create some beautiful effects with them.
35

35

00:01:36,968  -->  00:01:39,011
And we can do even more.
36

36

00:01:39,011  -->  00:01:42,401
We can use color gradients to achieve stunning effects,
37

37

00:01:42,401  -->  00:01:45,002
like these websites do.
38

38

00:01:45,002  -->  00:01:48,160
You can find a link to some beautiful color gradients
39

39

00:01:48,160  -->  00:01:50,459
in the course e-book.
40

40

00:01:50,459  -->  00:01:53,013
However it is important to keep in mind
41

41

00:01:53,013  -->  00:01:55,358
what we've learned about colors.
42

42

00:01:55,358  -->  00:01:59,514
Which means that you shouldn't just use some random colors.
43

43

00:01:59,514  -->  00:02:02,556
But you already know this by now, right?
44

44

00:02:02,556  -->  00:02:05,598
So please use image overlay with colors,
45

45

00:02:05,598  -->  00:02:09,615
other than black or white very carefully.
46

46

00:02:09,615  -->  00:02:12,332
Next, simply putting the text in a box
47

47

00:02:12,332  -->  00:02:15,095
is another easy way to make your text stand out
48

48

00:02:15,095  -->  00:02:16,697
and easy to read.
49

49

00:02:16,697  -->  00:02:19,716
Like the designer of this website div.
50

50

00:02:19,716  -->  00:02:21,922
The box should be opaque
51

51

00:02:21,922  -->  00:02:25,219
so that you can still see the image beneath it.
52

52

00:02:25,219  -->  00:02:29,386
In this case a white color with some transparency was used.
53

53

00:02:31,001  -->  00:02:33,044
You can also make the box black
54

54

00:02:33,044  -->  00:02:34,832
or go with some other color
55

55

00:02:34,832  -->  00:02:37,084
that you selected for your design.
56

56

00:02:37,084  -->  00:02:40,251
Just be creative and you will be fine.
57

57

00:02:42,310  -->  00:02:46,976
Yet another solution to put text on an images is image blur.
58

58

00:02:46,976  -->  00:02:48,950
And this is very powerful and
59

59

00:02:48,950  -->  00:02:51,643
also very good looking in my opinion.
60

60

00:02:51,643  -->  00:02:54,569
You can either blur the whole image
61

61

00:02:54,569  -->  00:02:56,032
like these two websites do.
62

62

00:02:56,032  -->  00:03:00,304
Or you can use an out-of-focus area of a photo as the blur,
63

63

00:03:00,304  -->  00:03:02,998
like the first of these two websites do.
64

64

00:03:02,998  -->  00:03:04,135
You see that?
65

65

00:03:04,135  -->  00:03:06,156
Now in this case we need to make sure
66

66

00:03:06,156  -->  00:03:08,594
that the text stays on the blurred image part
67

67

00:03:08,594  -->  00:03:11,403
on all screen resolutions.
68

68

00:03:11,403  -->  00:03:16,024
This is particularly important for responsive web design.
69

69

00:03:16,024  -->  00:03:18,369
And now the last method I want to show you
70

70

00:03:18,369  -->  00:03:20,807
is the so called floor fade.
71

71

00:03:20,807  -->  00:03:22,967
The floor fade is a technique
72

72

00:03:22,967  -->  00:03:26,914
where an image subtly fades towards black at the bottom.
73

73

00:03:26,914  -->  00:03:30,002
With white text written over it.
74

74

00:03:30,002  -->  00:03:33,602
This is the profile page of 500px.com
75

75

00:03:33,602  -->  00:03:37,085
and this uses the floor fade extremely well.
76

76

00:03:37,085  -->  00:03:39,151
So it is almost unnoticeable
77

77

00:03:39,151  -->  00:03:41,589
but still improving readability,
78

78

00:03:41,589  -->  00:03:44,469
which is exactly what we want.
79

79

00:03:44,469  -->  00:03:46,280
And this would be the same website
80

80

00:03:46,280  -->  00:03:48,578
but without the floor fade.
81

81

00:03:48,578  -->  00:03:51,272
And in this case we have a hard time
82

82

00:03:51,272  -->  00:03:54,848
reading some of the small white text down there.
83

83

00:03:54,848  -->  00:03:56,589
So the floor fade increases the
84

84

00:03:56,589  -->  00:03:59,840
text readability dramatically.
85

85

00:03:59,840  -->  00:04:02,255
This means that in situations like this
86

86

00:04:02,255  -->  00:04:05,970
where we want text at the bottom of an image,
87

87

00:04:05,970  -->  00:04:09,220
this is the perfect solution to go for.
88

88

00:04:10,103  -->  00:04:12,007
Now you may ask
89

89

00:04:12,007  -->  00:04:13,633
where do I get amazing images
90

90

00:04:13,633  -->  00:04:17,464
like the ones we saw in this lecture for my website?
91

91

00:04:17,464  -->  00:04:20,274
Well you either already took some great photos
92

92

00:04:20,274  -->  00:04:22,363
for some website you are planning
93

93

00:04:22,363  -->  00:04:25,521
or you can get a lot of super cool free images
94

94

00:04:25,521  -->  00:04:26,854
on the internet.
95

95

00:04:27,704  -->  00:04:31,212
There are images for everything you can imagine.
96

96

00:04:31,212  -->  00:04:34,230
As always I share the best resources with you
97

97

00:04:34,230  -->  00:04:35,980
in the course e-book.
98

98

00:04:36,877  -->  00:04:39,896
And this closes our lecture on working with images.
99

99

00:04:39,896  -->  00:04:43,518
In this lecture you saw a lot of great websites.
100

100

00:04:43,518  -->  00:04:46,003
And those can actually be a good inspiration
101

101

00:04:46,003  -->  00:04:48,253
for you and your websites.
