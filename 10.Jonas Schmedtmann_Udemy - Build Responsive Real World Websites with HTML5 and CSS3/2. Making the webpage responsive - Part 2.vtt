00:00:01.808  -->  00:00:03.272
<v Voiceover>In this lecture, we'll continue</v>
2

2

00:00:03.272  -->  00:00:05.855
to make our website responsive.
3

3

00:00:07.226  -->  00:00:08.554
So the next thing we can do here,
4

4

00:00:08.554  -->  00:00:11.664
is to remove some white space, for instance,
5

5

00:00:11.664  -->  00:00:13.143
here...
6

6

00:00:13.143  -->  00:00:15.768
And here between those steps,
7

7

00:00:15.768  -->  00:00:17.081
and here between the steps,
8

8

00:00:17.081  -->  00:00:18.331
and the button,
9

9

00:00:19.239  -->  00:00:23.737
and we will also increase this image a little bit
10

10

00:00:23.737  -->  00:00:25.428
and so let's go do that.
11

11

00:00:25.428  -->  00:00:27.948
We're still here at this media screen
12

12

00:00:27.948  -->  00:00:32.115
which will target from small tablets to big tablets.
13

13

00:00:33.820  -->  00:00:37.487
Alright, so we can start with the steps box,
14

14

00:00:41.717  -->  00:00:44.602
and let's say that it should have a margin top
15

15

00:00:44.602  -->  00:00:46.435
to only 10 pixels now.
16

16

00:00:48.360  -->  00:00:50.232
So I'm, as I said,
17

17

00:00:50.232  -->  00:00:54.232
starting to remove some of the white space here.
18

18

00:00:55.439  -->  00:00:57.772
So it also have the works...
19

19

00:00:59.413  -->  00:01:00.496
steps, right,
20

20

00:01:03.337  -->  00:01:07.504
and I will say that I want the margin bottom to be 40 pixels
21

21

00:01:08.845  -->  00:01:12.121
I think it was 50, if I remember it correctly,
22

22

00:01:12.121  -->  00:01:13.788
but, let's check it.
23

23

00:01:17.011  -->  00:01:18.344
It's old form...
24

24

00:01:22.610  -->  00:01:24.860
How it works section, okay,
25

25

00:01:27.286  -->  00:01:29.786
so the steps box had 30 and 70
26

26

00:01:30.763  -->  00:01:34.059
and now I'm going to set them to 10,
27

27

00:01:34.059  -->  00:01:35.558
and I'll actually have to do this
28

28

00:01:35.558  -->  00:01:38.641
for the steps box last child as well.
29

29

00:01:40.208  -->  00:01:44.927
Okay so the work steps, had a margin bottom here of 50,
30

30

00:01:44.927  -->  00:01:49.454
and I will have to set this one here as well.
31

31

00:01:49.454  -->  00:01:51.121
So let me copy this,
32

32

00:01:52.170  -->  00:01:56.337
and I'll also need the steps box last child, right?
33

33

00:01:59.968  -->  00:02:02.801
So this may be a little confusing,
34

34

00:02:03.824  -->  00:02:08.630
cause, y'know it's a lot of code we have to change here,
35

35

00:02:08.630  -->  00:02:12.792
so if you want you can then later review the code
36

36

00:02:12.792  -->  00:02:14.542
a little more slowly.
37

37

00:02:23.275  -->  00:02:26.078
So I want this to be 10 pixels as well,
38

38

00:02:26.078  -->  00:02:29.388
and now between the last steps and those buttons,
39

39

00:02:29.388  -->  00:02:32.555
I will say 60 pixels should be enough,
40

40

00:02:34.237  -->  00:02:38.226
and I will also now decrease the app screen,
41

41

00:02:38.226  -->  00:02:40.587
which is the image,
42

42

00:02:40.587  -->  00:02:42.545
and I want a width
43

43

00:02:42.545  -->  00:02:43.712
of 50 percent,
44

44

00:02:46.956  -->  00:02:50.706
so increase it from 40 percent to 50 percent.
45

45

00:02:54.775  -->  00:02:57.442
See it was 40 now it will be 50.
46

46

00:02:58.286  -->  00:03:01.619
Okay I'm going to reload this thing now.
47

47

00:03:03.116  -->  00:03:05.222
Well this looks much better, right?
48

48

00:03:05.222  -->  00:03:06.639
Let's re size it.
49

49

00:03:09.821  -->  00:03:13.071
Okay, so, here we have our break point,
50

50

00:03:15.012  -->  00:03:15.845
at 1023
51

51

00:03:19.435  -->  00:03:21.915
What does this... how it looks like?
52

52

00:03:21.915  -->  00:03:23.998
And as we get it smaller,
53

53

00:03:27.082  -->  00:03:29.832
so this is the other break point,
54

54

00:03:32.480  -->  00:03:34.134
okay,
55

55

00:03:34.134  -->  00:03:36.484
so this section looks good now,
56

56

00:03:36.484  -->  00:03:40.282
and now we have a little problem in here,
57

57

00:03:40.282  -->  00:03:43.365
because those icons are way too wide,
58

58

00:03:45.627  -->  00:03:48.960
so let's go back and reduce their width,
59

59

00:03:49.859  -->  00:03:54.026
and also I should actually decrease the font size in here.
60

60

00:03:57.991  -->  00:04:01.158
So, those icons are icons small class,
61

61

00:04:04.140  -->  00:04:05.890
so let me check them.
62

62

00:04:12.550  -->  00:04:15.300
So they had a width of 30 pixels,
63

63

00:04:17.369  -->  00:04:19.369
now we'll decrease that,
64

64

00:04:20.666  -->  00:04:23.438
to, let's say, 20 pixels,
65

65

00:04:23.438  -->  00:04:24.355
and then...
66

66

00:04:25.925  -->  00:04:27.758
the city future class,
67

67

00:04:31.447  -->  00:04:35.197
I will decrease it's font size to 90 percent.
68

68

00:04:39.963  -->  00:04:43.963
And let's reload this, and it looks much better.
69

69

00:04:47.010  -->  00:04:49.925
So there is still, like a line break here
70

70

00:04:49.925  -->  00:04:53.342
on some smaller width like this one here,
71

71

00:04:54.696  -->  00:04:55.529
So...
72

72

00:04:57.796  -->  00:05:00.213
We will decrease it even more
73

73

00:05:01.506  -->  00:05:03.089
to 17 for instance,
74

74

00:05:05.022  -->  00:05:07.189
and let me check it again,
75

75

00:05:08.801  -->  00:05:12.468
this margin right can be set to five pixels.
76

76

00:05:14.463  -->  00:05:18.468
So you see I'm changing a lot of stuff here
77

77

00:05:18.468  -->  00:05:20.923
and ya, I'm doing that because it really is important
78

78

00:05:20.923  -->  00:05:23.135
to make our websites look good
79

79

00:05:23.135  -->  00:05:25.718
on any device and on any width.
80

80

00:05:28.980  -->  00:05:31.842
So this doesn't change so much actually
81

81

00:05:31.842  -->  00:05:35.342
but, well, it's the best we can get right?
82

82

00:05:40.811  -->  00:05:43.644
So in here, everything looks okay,
83

83

00:05:44.538  -->  00:05:48.695
and now, so these boxes have a width of 90 percent,
84

84

00:05:48.695  -->  00:05:52.528
and a margin left of 5 percent to center them,
85

85

00:05:54.420  -->  00:05:56.670
so I'm going to change that
86

86

00:05:57.983  -->  00:06:01.233
down here and these are called plan box
87

87

00:06:04.346  -->  00:06:08.513
and so let's change now the width and say 100 percent
88

88

00:06:09.935  -->  00:06:12.935
and the margin left to zero percent.
89

89

00:06:16.759  -->  00:06:18.009
Let's check it,
90

90

00:06:19.080  -->  00:06:23.247
it's better and now let's decrease these font sizes here,
91

91

00:06:24.408  -->  00:06:27.438
and there's also some weird thing going on again
92

92

00:06:27.438  -->  00:06:31.236
with the HTML so I'm also going to fix that,
93

93

00:06:31.236  -->  00:06:35.403
but let's start by reducing the font size here of this.
94

94

00:06:37.452  -->  00:06:40.285
And that is the plan price, right?
95

95

00:06:43.685  -->  00:06:46.386
Actually going to copy this one,
96

96

00:06:46.386  -->  00:06:47.719
and put it here.
97

97

00:06:54.135  -->  00:06:57.468
And let's say you want it in 50 percent,
98

98

00:07:04.227  -->  00:07:07.840
so the code is getting much bigger
99

99

00:07:07.840  -->  00:07:10.507
and it's not always easy to find
100

100

00:07:13.157  -->  00:07:16.324
the stuff that we want to edit, right?
101

101

00:07:18.190  -->  00:07:21.440
Pdat is the problem, let's adjust that,
102

102

00:07:25.021  -->  00:07:26.021
Alright, so,
103

103

00:07:29.254  -->  00:07:30.587
alright and now,
104

104

00:07:32.162  -->  00:07:32.995
just let's
105

105

00:07:35.171  -->  00:07:39.338
increase the width of this contact form class as well.
106

106

00:07:41.138  -->  00:07:42.388
Contact form...
107

107

00:07:46.554  -->  00:07:47.804
And 80 percent.
108

108

00:07:50.276  -->  00:07:54.559
So we still don't want this to be full width,
109

109

00:07:54.559  -->  00:07:56.976
but a little wider is better.
110

110

00:07:57.880  -->  00:07:58.713
Alright,
111

111

00:08:01.836  -->  00:08:04.153
so this looks good now.
112

112

00:08:04.153  -->  00:08:08.153
So we fixed everything in this media query here,
113

113

00:08:09.062  -->  00:08:11.779
so now let's get to the next one,
114

114

00:08:11.779  -->  00:08:15.946
and this one is for small phones to small tablets,
115

115

00:08:17.474  -->  00:08:20.000
for instance, the iPhone six,
116

116

00:08:20.000  -->  00:08:24.283
so I will put this browser to this lowest width
117

117

00:08:24.283  -->  00:08:25.450
of 481 or 480.
118

118

00:08:30.332  -->  00:08:31.165
So...
119

119

00:08:34.896  -->  00:08:36.057
You see the width up there,
120

120

00:08:36.057  -->  00:08:38.807
and 480 is absolutely very small,
121

121

00:08:40.046  -->  00:08:42.796
let's say like 500, close to 500.
122

122

00:08:47.012  -->  00:08:50.668
So, a lot of things going on here,
123

123

00:08:50.668  -->  00:08:55.007
all of this looks quite bad right now, right?
124

124

00:08:55.007  -->  00:08:57.322
So that's what I mean we really need to adapt this,
125

125

00:08:57.322  -->  00:08:58.989
look at this button.
126

126

00:09:03.679  -->  00:09:06.083
And you also notice a strange thing here,
127

127

00:09:06.083  -->  00:09:07.666
which is this here,
128

128

00:09:09.512  -->  00:09:11.762
so now we have this problem
129

129

00:09:13.343  -->  00:09:17.510
because some of the text goes out of the actual width.
130

130

00:09:19.770  -->  00:09:23.103
So, let us fix that and it's easy to do.
131

131

00:09:25.314  -->  00:09:26.564
We just need to
132

132

00:09:28.324  -->  00:09:30.605
add a new style here,
133

133

00:09:30.605  -->  00:09:33.688
which is overflow x, and then hidden,
134

134

00:09:35.553  -->  00:09:37.224
so now that will get hidden,
135

135

00:09:37.224  -->  00:09:40.325
and we actually should do the same for the buddy,
136

136

00:09:40.325  -->  00:09:43.826
and we can actually add buddy here,
137

137

00:09:43.826  -->  00:09:46.409
it's not such a big difference.
138

138

00:09:47.396  -->  00:09:50.165
So now that will be fixed and problem as well,
139

139

00:09:50.165  -->  00:09:53.334
so let's go back to our queries and start adding some code
140

140

00:09:53.334  -->  00:09:55.417
to this media query here.
141

141

00:09:56.400  -->  00:10:00.567
So I'll start by reducing the body font size even more,
142

142

00:10:02.264  -->  00:10:03.681
to now 60 pixels,
143

143

00:10:08.234  -->  00:10:09.484
and the section
144

144

00:10:11.465  -->  00:10:14.706
I will reduce the padding between those
145

145

00:10:14.706  -->  00:10:17.230
so the white space between those
146

146

00:10:17.230  -->  00:10:19.529
which we set to 60 before
147

147

00:10:19.529  -->  00:10:21.130
but now we have really small devices
148

148

00:10:21.130  -->  00:10:24.161
so let's say 30 pixels and zero.
149

149

00:10:24.161  -->  00:10:26.494
And now the padding at rows,
150

150

00:10:30.057  -->  00:10:33.767
we set it before at, yep, two percent,
151

151

00:10:33.767  -->  00:10:36.850
but let's set it to four percent now,
152

152

00:10:37.912  -->  00:10:38.745
so row
153

153

00:10:40.405  -->  00:10:43.488
and also this box this hero text box,
154

154

00:10:44.764  -->  00:10:46.847
this is equally important
155

155

00:10:48.135  -->  00:10:49.302
in the header.
156

156

00:10:50.781  -->  00:10:55.553
So let's set their padding on the left and the right side.
157

157

00:10:55.553  -->  00:10:57.955
So zero in top and bottom
158

158

00:10:57.955  -->  00:11:00.872
and four percent at left and right.
159

159

00:11:03.960  -->  00:11:06.154
And before we go check how this looks,
160

160

00:11:06.154  -->  00:11:08.313
we can do one last thing,
161

161

00:11:08.313  -->  00:11:09.674
and this is,
162

162

00:11:09.674  -->  00:11:11.257
that we now want to
163

163

00:11:14.446  -->  00:11:17.720
define the width of all the columns as 100 percent
164

164

00:11:17.720  -->  00:11:19.698
which means that the columns will no longer be
165

165

00:11:19.698  -->  00:11:23.865
side by side but will be stacked on top of each other.
166

166

00:11:26.420  -->  00:11:29.253
So let's see what that looks like.
167

167

00:11:30.202  -->  00:11:31.785
Alright here we go,
168

168

00:11:33.936  -->  00:11:35.295
still have this problem here
169

169

00:11:35.295  -->  00:11:37.682
I'm going to talk about it in a second.
170

170

00:11:37.682  -->  00:11:41.442
So, this is what I was talking about,
171

171

00:11:41.442  -->  00:11:44.359
those are now on top of each other.
172

172

00:11:46.753  -->  00:11:48.789
Right here we have some weird stuff going on,
173

173

00:11:48.789  -->  00:11:50.324
I'm going to fix that in a second,
174

174

00:11:50.324  -->  00:11:53.494
those images are way too large,
175

175

00:11:53.494  -->  00:11:57.550
and down here everything looks quite good.
176

176

00:11:57.550  -->  00:12:00.825
But, yep, one thing after the other.
177

177

00:12:00.825  -->  00:12:04.170
I'm first going to fix this navigation,
178

178

00:12:04.170  -->  00:12:07.599
and in fact, we're going to build a mobile notification
179

179

00:12:07.599  -->  00:12:09.182
in the next section
180

180

00:12:10.444  -->  00:12:13.777
where we will start learning some jQuery
181

181

00:12:15.006  -->  00:12:19.173
and so for now, I'm just going to hide all of the navigation
182

182

00:12:20.212  -->  00:12:22.686
and that's pretty easy to do actually,
183

183

00:12:22.686  -->  00:12:23.936
I will just say
184

184

00:12:25.089  -->  00:12:26.006
main nav...
185

185

00:12:28.978  -->  00:12:29.978
display none
186

186

00:12:31.998  -->  00:12:35.415
and this will hide the entire navigation.
187

187

00:12:38.111  -->  00:12:38.944
Alright...
188

188

00:12:41.786  -->  00:12:43.203
The class name...
189

189

00:12:46.975  -->  00:12:49.808
Okay and that looks better for now
190

190

00:12:51.797  -->  00:12:56.658
So, I'm not going to change every little detail here now
191

191

00:12:56.658  -->  00:13:00.825
because, y'know, you can change that later on yourself,
192

192

00:13:02.092  -->  00:13:04.669
I'm just going to fix the most important thing now,
193

193

00:13:04.669  -->  00:13:07.368
which is for instance, this margin here,
194

194

00:13:07.368  -->  00:13:11.535
so I now want this paragraph to be 100 percent wide as well
195

195

00:13:13.064  -->  00:13:17.417
so that's one of the things that I'm going to change
196

196

00:13:17.417  -->  00:13:19.741
then we can probably make these
197

197

00:13:19.741  -->  00:13:22.408
H2 elements a little bit smaller
198

198

00:13:23.434  -->  00:13:26.429
and the H1 element as well,
199

199

00:13:26.429  -->  00:13:29.456
and then take away some more white space here
200

200

00:13:29.456  -->  00:13:32.873
from this section will also be important,
201

201

00:13:33.952  -->  00:13:38.119
and I think down here most of the thing look pretty good.
202

202

00:13:42.417  -->  00:13:45.084
So, no need all this space here,
203

203

00:13:47.553  -->  00:13:49.138
you already had changed the long copy here
204

204

00:13:49.138  -->  00:13:52.475
but now I'm gonna go even further
205

205

00:13:52.475  -->  00:13:54.892
and say 100 percent in margin
206

206

00:13:56.409  -->  00:13:57.409
zero percent
207

207

00:13:59.788  -->  00:14:01.033
but then as I said I will also
208

208

00:14:01.033  -->  00:14:04.535
reduce the font size of the H1 element.
209

209

00:14:04.535  -->  00:14:05.535
So font size
210

210

00:14:07.269  -->  00:14:08.102
let me say
211

211

00:14:10.245  -->  00:14:11.162
180 percent
212

212

00:14:14.078  -->  00:14:17.561
and I will duplicate this for the H2 element
213

213

00:14:17.561  -->  00:14:20.478
and reduce the size to 150 percent.
214

214

00:14:23.500  -->  00:14:24.667
Okay, and now,
215

215

00:14:26.164  -->  00:14:27.247
going back to
216

216

00:14:28.412  -->  00:14:32.643
this code here which is for the how it works section,
217

217

00:14:32.643  -->  00:14:36.476
let's make this white space even smaller here,
218

218

00:14:39.243  -->  00:14:40.829
let me check how it looks
219

219

00:14:40.829  -->  00:14:43.746
so that I know what to change here,
220

220

00:14:47.232  -->  00:14:51.399
so the most important thing is to reduce this here, right?
221

221

00:14:53.977  -->  00:14:57.310
So let's do that, so we don't need this,
222

222

00:14:59.915  -->  00:15:01.588
probably 20 pixels is great
223

223

00:15:01.588  -->  00:15:05.755
and here also 20 we don't need so much white space.
224

224

00:15:07.524  -->  00:15:10.607
And one other thing I should do there
225

225

00:15:12.030  -->  00:15:15.697
is to reduce the circle in the work section,
226

226

00:15:30.454  -->  00:15:34.042
so let's change this here maybe to
227

227

00:15:34.042  -->  00:15:34.875
40 pixels
228

228

00:15:36.183  -->  00:15:38.350
and 40 pixels here as well
229

229

00:15:39.353  -->  00:15:42.686
we'll of course not change any of those.
230

230

00:15:48.393  -->  00:15:50.476
Change this to 15 pixels,
231

231

00:15:54.574  -->  00:15:57.326
and also decrease the padding a little bit,
232

232

00:15:57.326  -->  00:16:01.243
so make all of the things a little bit smaller.
233

233

00:16:04.432  -->  00:16:07.251
Okay, something is not working here right now,
234

234

00:16:07.251  -->  00:16:09.918
this space is still way too big.
235

235

00:16:12.387  -->  00:16:16.137
I guess because I misspelled this right here.
236

236

00:16:22.229  -->  00:16:24.144
Okay, now it looks better,
237

237

00:16:24.144  -->  00:16:27.210
and I just need to change the font size in here,
238

238

00:16:27.210  -->  00:16:31.377
and to, of course, put this image here in the center.
239

239

00:16:35.133  -->  00:16:36.216
So font size,
240

240

00:16:40.167  -->  00:16:42.412
100 percent let's say...
241

241

00:16:42.412  -->  00:16:43.329
120 in fact
242

242

00:16:45.864  -->  00:16:47.432
and...
243

243

00:16:47.432  -->  00:16:49.015
So where is that...
244

244

00:16:51.043  -->  00:16:53.126
So this is for the image,
245

245

00:16:54.510  -->  00:16:56.927
so the steps box first child,
246

246

00:17:00.152  -->  00:17:02.569
I now want it to be centered.
247

247

00:17:11.459  -->  00:17:15.292
Alright, let's just re size this a little bit.
248

248

00:17:17.342  -->  00:17:20.592
Woah the image is so incredibly big now
249

249

00:17:22.217  -->  00:17:26.300
so we better make that a little bit smaller again
250

250

00:17:28.533  -->  00:17:30.116
so where is that...
251

251

00:17:32.979  -->  00:17:34.729
Here it's app screen,
252

252

00:17:36.758  -->  00:17:40.930
app screen and I'm going to change that to 40 pixels,
253

253

00:17:40.930  -->  00:17:44.013
okay looks like the correct size now,
254

254

00:17:47.681  -->  00:17:49.281
alright,
255

255

00:17:49.281  -->  00:17:53.410
so as I said I will let you tweak other minor things
256

256

00:17:53.410  -->  00:17:57.467
here on the website on your own with your own CSS
257

257

00:17:57.467  -->  00:18:00.324
but there's still one thing that I need to fix
258

258

00:18:00.324  -->  00:18:02.449
and it's this here.
259

259

00:18:02.449  -->  00:18:04.159
You see, these columns doesn't start
260

260

00:18:04.159  -->  00:18:06.242
at the same point, right?
261

261

00:18:07.886  -->  00:18:11.664
So the first column is different that this one here,
262

262

00:18:11.664  -->  00:18:15.831
and that is actually because I forgot to change one thing
263

263

00:18:16.710  -->  00:18:19.411
and it has to do here with the column
264

264

00:18:19.411  -->  00:18:22.565
and this comes actually from this grid file,
265

265

00:18:22.565  -->  00:18:24.898
so all columns have a margin
266

266

00:18:26.690  -->  00:18:30.857
which is this one, let me copy it, to our query CSS
267

267

00:18:31.949  -->  00:18:35.366
so that we can change it to what we want.
268

268

00:18:40.014  -->  00:18:43.341
So currently we have a left margin of one percent
269

269

00:18:43.341  -->  00:18:44.341
zero percent
270

270

00:18:46.897  -->  00:18:48.414
at right side,
271

271

00:18:48.414  -->  00:18:52.401
one percent bottom, and one point six on the left.
272

272

00:18:52.401  -->  00:18:56.303
So now we don't want anything of that,
273

273

00:18:56.303  -->  00:18:59.280
we want the margin to be zero here,
274

274

00:18:59.280  -->  00:19:00.657
zero on the right,
275

275

00:19:00.657  -->  00:19:03.653
and on the bottom is the only place we want some margin,
276

276

00:19:03.653  -->  00:19:05.653
because we want, y'know,
277

277

00:19:06.560  -->  00:19:10.374
we want some distance here between those boxes,
278

278

00:19:10.374  -->  00:19:14.541
so let me put this to four percent and this also to zero
279

279

00:19:16.468  -->  00:19:20.048
and that will now fix this weird thing, ya,
280

280

00:19:20.048  -->  00:19:21.284
and this looks much better
281

281

00:19:21.284  -->  00:19:25.408
now we have some space here between the boxes,
282

282

00:19:25.408  -->  00:19:29.075
and they all start at the same place, right.
283

283

00:19:31.084  -->  00:19:34.167
So I think this looks cool now and...
284

284

00:19:37.894  -->  00:19:39.669
That's now...
285

285

00:19:39.669  -->  00:19:42.418
Look here at our last media query
286

286

00:19:42.418  -->  00:19:45.668
which is for really small screen sizes.
287

287

00:19:46.567  -->  00:19:48.900
Let me just put this here
288

288

00:19:48.900  -->  00:19:52.400
like actually can put it smaller than this
289

289

00:19:54.456  -->  00:19:56.318
and it still looks good in here
290

290

00:19:56.318  -->  00:20:00.099
so I guess maybe not so much to change.
291

291

00:20:00.099  -->  00:20:04.174
So all I'm going to do is make this form 100 percent wide
292

292

00:20:04.174  -->  00:20:07.950
and to remove even more padding between those sections
293

293

00:20:07.950  -->  00:20:12.758
because we have to imagine that it's a really small phone.
294

294

00:20:12.758  -->  00:20:17.409
So let me just make some minor changes here in fact.
295

295

00:20:17.409  -->  00:20:19.159
So I will say section
296

296

00:20:22.894  -->  00:20:26.311
padding we had 30 pixels let's say 25 now
297

297

00:20:28.606  -->  00:20:30.523
and zero left and right
298

298

00:20:32.627  -->  00:20:34.294
and the contact form
299

299

00:20:38.360  -->  00:20:39.693
can have a width
300

300

00:20:41.773  -->  00:20:43.537
of 100 percent
301

301

00:20:43.537  -->  00:20:46.466
so I just didn't want to leave this empty
302

302

00:20:46.466  -->  00:20:50.400
but in fact it maybe was not so necessary
303

303

00:20:50.400  -->  00:20:52.316
but who knows maybe in your future websites
304

304

00:20:52.316  -->  00:20:55.347
you will actually need this media query.
305

305

00:20:55.347  -->  00:20:59.347
So I'm going to reload this for the last time...
306

306

00:21:03.239  -->  00:21:06.989
And so this is our website on a mobile phone,
307

307

00:21:09.708  -->  00:21:13.937
so feel free to change some more stuff here on your own

308

00:21:13.937  -->  00:21:16.648
because now you know how all of this works,
309

309

00:21:16.648  -->  00:21:20.218
but I'm going to leave it as this.
310

310

00:21:20.218  -->  00:21:21.595
So, we are now done
311

311

00:21:21.595  -->  00:21:24.420
with the HTML and CSS part of our website actually
312

312

00:21:24.420  -->  00:21:27.798
so congratulations, in the next lecture,
313

313

00:21:27.798  -->  00:21:31.786
we will just test this website on different browsers,
314

314

00:21:31.786  -->  00:21:35.931
which is a very important aspects of web design
315

315

00:21:35.931  -->  00:21:37.882
and web development.
316

316

00:21:37.882  -->  00:21:39.299
So see you there.
