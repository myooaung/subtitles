00:00:01.089  -->  00:00:03.364
<v Voiceover>Nobody likes slow websites.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.364  -->  00:00:05.532
We all know that, right?
3

3

00:00:05.532  -->  00:00:08.631
Besides that, page speed can have a real impact
4

4

00:00:08.631  -->  00:00:10.752
on your user's engagement,
5

5

00:00:10.752  -->  00:00:14.919
because nobody wants to wait for some website to load.
6

6

00:00:15.831  -->  00:00:19.238
So, do you still remember our seven steps plan?
7

7

00:00:19.238  -->  00:00:22.087
We have been working on step four all this time,
8

8

00:00:22.087  -->  00:00:24.937
designing and developing our website.
9

9

00:00:24.937  -->  00:00:27.244
But now, let's start with step five,
10

10

00:00:27.244  -->  00:00:30.263
and make our users love our website even more
11

11

00:00:30.263  -->  00:00:34.267
by using some techniques for speeding upload times.
12

12

00:00:34.267  -->  00:00:37.479
And there are two very basic things we can do,
13

13

00:00:37.479  -->  00:00:41.646
optimize heavy images and minify CSS and jQuery Code.
14

14

00:00:42.518  -->  00:00:44.185
So let's go do that.
15

15

00:00:46.451  -->  00:00:49.748
So the first thing we have to optimize are images,
16

16

00:00:49.748  -->  00:00:52.682
and that's because images are usually, by far,
17

17

00:00:52.682  -->  00:00:55.849
the more heavy content of our webpage.
18

18

00:00:57.468  -->  00:00:59.551
We'll just show you that.
19

19

00:01:00.866  -->  00:01:04.033
So I come here to my resources folder,
20

20

00:01:04.923  -->  00:01:06.325
then we have here the meals.
21

21

00:01:06.325  -->  00:01:10.492
So you'll see 200 kilobytes, 200, all of these images.
22

22

00:01:12.789  -->  00:01:15.607
And, for instance, the cities.
23

23

00:01:15.607  -->  00:01:17.857
200 kilobyte, you see here.
24

24

00:01:19.252  -->  00:01:20.664
Also 195.
25

25

00:01:20.664  -->  00:01:23.172
So all of these images together combined,
26

26

00:01:23.172  -->  00:01:27.339
when we download the website this takes a long time
27

27

00:01:28.513  -->  00:01:30.846
to load all of these images.
28

28

00:01:31.958  -->  00:01:34.396
So image someone with a slow internet connection,
29

29

00:01:34.396  -->  00:01:38.622
on a smartphone or so, would try to download this site
30

30

00:01:38.622  -->  00:01:42.345
that would actually take them forever, right?
31

31

00:01:42.345  -->  00:01:45.012
So let's reduce that file sizes,
32

32

00:01:46.124  -->  00:01:48.686
and as a first step we can reduce
33

33

00:01:48.686  -->  00:01:51.603
the actual dimension of the images.
34

34

00:01:53.316  -->  00:01:55.430
And so far we've never really looked
35

35

00:01:55.430  -->  00:01:58.263
at the image dimensions until now.
36

36

00:02:00.323  -->  00:02:02.320
We just included all our images
37

37

00:02:02.320  -->  00:02:05.269
and didn't really worry about anything.
38

38

00:02:05.269  -->  00:02:06.686
So let's do that now,
39

39

00:02:06.686  -->  00:02:09.225
and I will use the Chrome Developer Tools,
40

40

00:02:09.225  -->  00:02:13.103
and we will look at these four city images.
41

41

00:02:13.103  -->  00:02:15.999
So, again, you see how useful this is.
42

42

00:02:15.999  -->  00:02:17.832
Okay, here we have it.
43

43

00:02:18.918  -->  00:02:22.131
So inspect this image and now here we have it.
44

44

00:02:22.131  -->  00:02:24.826
And when we hover that image we can see
45

45

00:02:24.826  -->  00:02:28.993
the actual size of the file, which is 900 by 600 pixels,
46

46

00:02:31.096  -->  00:02:33.506
and then the size that is displayed on the website,
47

47

00:02:33.506  -->  00:02:36.173
which is only 249 by 166 pixels.
48

48

00:02:38.368  -->  00:02:40.574
So the original image is way bigger
49

49

00:02:40.574  -->  00:02:44.004
than what we actually see on the screen.
50

50

00:02:44.004  -->  00:02:46.102
Now we have to think about one thing,
51

51

00:02:46.102  -->  00:02:48.912
which is responsive web design
52

52

00:02:48.912  -->  00:02:52.829
where images will actually get a little bigger.
53

53

00:02:55.770  -->  00:03:00.378
So it, for instance, optimizes for this image size.
54

54

00:03:00.378  -->  00:03:04.545
You see the images are now larger than they were before.
55

55

00:03:05.541  -->  00:03:09.541
And let me actually hide this part a little bit.
56

56

00:03:11.161  -->  00:03:12.957
So inspect element again,
57

57

00:03:12.957  -->  00:03:15.790
and you see its 361 by 240 pixels,
58

58

00:03:17.075  -->  00:03:19.313
which we see here on the screen.
59

59

00:03:19.313  -->  00:03:22.396
So let's make that 375, for instance.
60

60

00:03:24.537  -->  00:03:27.518
So that's the size that we need.
61

61

00:03:27.518  -->  00:03:30.281
Now, I want the image size to be always twice
62

62

00:03:30.281  -->  00:03:32.728
as much as the actual size.
63

63

00:03:32.728  -->  00:03:34.571
And there's a simple reason for that,
64

64

00:03:34.571  -->  00:03:37.032
and it is high resolution displays.
65

65

00:03:37.032  -->  00:03:38.913
And those high resolution displays,
66

66

00:03:38.913  -->  00:03:43.219
like the retina displays we have on MacBooks, and iPhones,
67

67

00:03:43.219  -->  00:03:45.752
and also on your smartphones,
68

68

00:03:45.752  -->  00:03:47.734
need the image files to be larger
69

69

00:03:47.734  -->  00:03:49.429
than they appear on the screen
70

70

00:03:49.429  -->  00:03:52.679
in order to make them look super sharp.
71

71

00:03:53.803  -->  00:03:57.470
So in our case, that would be 375 times two.
72

72

00:04:00.298  -->  00:04:01.131
So 375.
73

73

00:04:02.738  -->  00:04:06.905
So we want the image to be 750 pixels and not 900.
74

74

00:04:08.157  -->  00:04:10.618
So we can reduce the image dimensions,
75

75

00:04:10.618  -->  00:04:12.031
which is a cool thing.
76

76

00:04:12.031  -->  00:04:14.448
So remember this number, 750.
77

77

00:04:16.001  -->  00:04:20.168
All right, so we come to our folder and to the cities,
78

78

00:04:22.874  -->  00:04:27.573
which are San Francisco, London, Lisbon, and Berlin.
79

79

00:04:27.573  -->  00:04:30.925
Now, if you're a Mac user, there's quite a handy way
80

80

00:04:30.925  -->  00:04:35.918
to reduce the dimensions of the images all at the same time.
81

81

00:04:35.918  -->  00:04:38.774
So I will just open them,
82

82

00:04:38.774  -->  00:04:42.010
then here I say, "Command A" to select all of them,
83

83

00:04:42.010  -->  00:04:45.760
and then just come here and reduce it to 750.
84

84

00:04:48.752  -->  00:04:51.663
Okay, and on a Windows machine you could
85

85

00:04:51.663  -->  00:04:54.086
use some other program to do the same thing.
86

86

00:04:54.086  -->  00:04:58.253
So we see here we reduced from 1.1 megabyte to 490 kilobyte,
87

87

00:05:01.865  -->  00:05:03.615
and that's very good.
88

88

00:05:04.915  -->  00:05:07.248
That's a huge file reduction
89

89

00:05:10.156  -->  00:05:11.767
and that's exactly what we wanted to do.
90

90

00:05:11.767  -->  00:05:13.029
End.
91

91

00:05:13.029  -->  00:05:15.029
Let's save those images.
92

92

00:05:15.987  -->  00:05:19.632
So you see this is a very great way of doing this,
93

93

00:05:19.632  -->  00:05:21.965
of reducing some files size,
94

94

00:05:24.717  -->  00:05:25.849
and now we reload this
95

95

00:05:25.849  -->  00:05:29.599
and everything looks exactly the same, right?
96

96

00:05:32.127  -->  00:05:35.610
So this the first step to increase
97

97

00:05:35.610  -->  00:05:38.110
the page speed of our website.
98

98

00:05:40.866  -->  00:05:43.977
And you could now go ahead and do the same thing
99

99

00:05:43.977  -->  00:05:46.369
for this image here, for instance,
100

100

00:05:46.369  -->  00:05:47.869
or for these ones.
101

101

00:05:50.603  -->  00:05:54.203
And, yeah, I think you should do that.
102

102

00:05:54.203  -->  00:05:57.941
So this was the first step of reducing heavy images.
103

103

00:05:57.941  -->  00:06:01.610
And now, another thing we can do, maybe even powerful,
104

104

00:06:01.610  -->  00:06:05.496
is to use this tool called Optimizilla,
105

105

00:06:05.496  -->  00:06:08.913
which basically compresses images online.
106

106

00:06:10.163  -->  00:06:12.029
And we will use this tool
107

107

00:06:12.029  -->  00:06:14.946
to compress our two biggest images.
108

108

00:06:18.705  -->  00:06:20.372
And it's these ones.
109

109

00:06:21.437  -->  00:06:25.604
You see this is 1.2 megabytes and this 2.5 megabytes,
110

110

00:06:26.577  -->  00:06:28.660
so these are huge images.
111

111

00:06:29.511  -->  00:06:32.594
So we will now compress these images.
112

112

00:06:40.154  -->  00:06:44.321
And try to save a huge amount of precious space here.
113

113

00:06:45.179  -->  00:06:46.943
So now we just upload these files,
114

114

00:06:46.943  -->  00:06:51.110
and this takes a little bit of our time, of course.
115

115

00:06:56.789  -->  00:06:59.978
Now the tool starts to actually compress this file,
116

116

00:06:59.978  -->  00:07:02.323
and now we can see it down here
117

117

00:07:02.323  -->  00:07:05.513
while the other one keeps uploading.
118

118

00:07:05.513  -->  00:07:08.679
And, okay, so here we have the quality.
119

119

00:07:08.679  -->  00:07:10.693
We can change that if we want.
120

120

00:07:10.693  -->  00:07:13.015
And here are the original and the compressed side-by-side
121

121

00:07:13.015  -->  00:07:17.296
and you see with a quality of 88 percent, which is a lot,
122

122

00:07:17.296  -->  00:07:19.905
so these images look quite alike.
123

123

00:07:19.905  -->  00:07:23.405
We can reduce 43 percent of the file size.
124

124

00:07:24.302  -->  00:07:26.635
So this is very good, right?
125

125

00:07:27.901  -->  00:07:28.734
And in this case,
126

126

00:07:28.734  -->  00:07:32.901
this image here disappears behind that black layer,
127

127

00:07:34.191  -->  00:07:35.546
so this is very dark.
128

128

00:07:35.546  -->  00:07:37.738
So we almost can see the image
129

129

00:07:37.738  -->  00:07:41.810
and so I will even reduce the quality even more.
130

130

00:07:41.810  -->  00:07:45.977
And this will hopefully helps saving even more space.
131

131

00:07:47.275  -->  00:07:48.923
And all right.
132

132

00:07:48.923  -->  00:07:52.523
So this will now be less than 400 K
133

133

00:07:52.523  -->  00:07:54.467
and before it was 1.2 megabytes.
134

134

00:07:54.467  -->  00:07:56.239
So this is very good.
135

135

00:07:56.239  -->  00:07:58.822
And now I'll just say, "Apply."
136

136

00:08:00.544  -->  00:08:04.189
And then I can download this image.
137

137

00:08:04.189  -->  00:08:07.272
And now the same thing with this one,
138

138

00:08:08.229  -->  00:08:11.094
and you see that with a quality of 90 percent,
139

139

00:08:11.094  -->  00:08:14.112
so this image is almost as good as this one,
140

140

00:08:14.112  -->  00:08:17.445
we reduce from 2.4 mega to 780 kilobyte.
141

141

00:08:19.926  -->  00:08:21.652
So in this case, this image is very important,
142

142

00:08:21.652  -->  00:08:23.704
this is our header image.
143

143

00:08:23.704  -->  00:08:26.351
I don't want to reduce the quality more than this,
144

144

00:08:26.351  -->  00:08:31.259
so I'll just say, "Okay, that's all right for me,"
145

145

00:08:31.259  -->  00:08:34.649
and then hit download here as well.
146

146

00:08:34.649  -->  00:08:38.649
And now I have both files in my download folder,
147

147

00:08:40.007  -->  00:08:42.166
and I will just put them here together
148

148

00:08:42.166  -->  00:08:43.999
with the other images.
149

149

00:08:47.190  -->  00:08:48.023
So one.
150

150

00:08:49.927  -->  00:08:50.760
And two.
151

151

00:08:52.513  -->  00:08:55.215
So you see these have a different file names.
152

152

00:08:55.215  -->  00:08:58.215
So, it's hero min and customers min.
153

153

00:08:59.450  -->  00:09:03.117
Now, of course, I need to go to our CSS file
154

154

00:09:03.994  -->  00:09:07.579
and change that image as well, all right?
155

155

00:09:07.579  -->  00:09:09.723
So where is that first one?
156

156

00:09:09.723  -->  00:09:11.148
Okay.
157

157

00:09:11.148  -->  00:09:12.170
Here we are.
158

158

00:09:12.170  -->  00:09:15.503
So hero and now it is actually hero min.
159

159

00:09:18.427  -->  00:09:20.510
And yeah, here it is.
160

160

00:09:20.510  -->  00:09:23.177
And the other, hero min as well.
161

161

00:09:24.457  -->  00:09:25.473
So we have these two lines here
162

162

00:09:25.473  -->  00:09:29.405
because of the prefix I showed you before.
163

163

00:09:29.405  -->  00:09:32.656
So this is the web kit version and this is original version.
164

164

00:09:32.656  -->  00:09:36.418
And of course, I need to change the image in both.
165

165

00:09:36.418  -->  00:09:38.835
And the same thing down here.
166

166

00:09:39.770  -->  00:09:43.603
So here I say, "Min," and here the same thing.
167

167

00:09:46.930  -->  00:09:49.763
All right, so let's open our page,
168

168

00:09:52.279  -->  00:09:56.026
and you see this looks exactly the same as it did before,
169

169

00:09:56.026  -->  00:09:59.276
and we reduced a whole amount of space,
170

170

00:10:00.330  -->  00:10:03.752
and saved our users precious bandwidth
171

171

00:10:03.752  -->  00:10:07.165
so they need to download way less data.
172

172

00:10:07.165  -->  00:10:10.671
So you see, it's really easy to optimize images,
173

173

00:10:10.671  -->  00:10:13.838
and it makes a really huge difference.
174

174

00:10:15.339  -->  00:10:19.054
Now, another thing that we can do is to minify CSS
175

175

00:10:19.054  -->  00:10:20.781
and jQuery code.
176

176

00:10:20.781  -->  00:10:24.565
And this basically reduces the size of the CSS
177

177

00:10:24.565  -->  00:10:28.475
and jQuery files by removing unneeded wide space
178

178

00:10:28.475  -->  00:10:31.037
and by optimizing that code.
179

179

00:10:31.037  -->  00:10:34.250
But, however, minifying code makes it quite difficult
180

180

00:10:34.250  -->  00:10:35.690
for humans to read,
181

181

00:10:35.690  -->  00:10:38.641
so we should only minify code when we're ready
182

182

00:10:38.641  -->  00:10:40.308
to launch a website.
183

183

00:10:41.250  -->  00:10:44.710
So, in the case of CSS, we can use this tool here,
184

184

00:10:44.710  -->  00:10:48.796
and I will actually not do that right now.
185

185

00:10:48.796  -->  00:10:51.796
I will just grab some CSS code here,
186

186

00:10:54.169  -->  00:10:58.336
for instance let me say, I don't know, this code here,
187

187

00:11:00.121  -->  00:11:01.352
and we can paste it here.
188

188

00:11:01.352  -->  00:11:03.729
So I will not do this for all our code,
189

189

00:11:03.729  -->  00:11:07.670
I will just show you what I mean by minifying the code.
190

190

00:11:07.670  -->  00:11:11.106
So here we can say, "The highest compression of all."
191

191

00:11:11.106  -->  00:11:12.773
And then process it.
192

192

00:11:14.900  -->  00:11:16.126
And here is the result.
193

193

00:11:16.126  -->  00:11:17.937
So, as I said, this is quite difficult,
194

194

00:11:17.937  -->  00:11:20.671
or even impossible, to read.
195

195

00:11:20.671  -->  00:11:23.062
This is all our code completely compressed,
196

196

00:11:23.062  -->  00:11:26.499
so no comments, no wide space, nothing.
197

197

00:11:26.499  -->  00:11:30.771
And we had a compression of 50 percent, actually.
198

198

00:11:30.771  -->  00:11:33.444
So this is another thing we can do,
199

199

00:11:33.444  -->  00:11:35.960
and you can find the link to this tool
200

200

00:11:35.960  -->  00:11:40.127
and the JavaScript tool in the course eBook, as always.
201

201

00:11:40.999  -->  00:11:43.431
And this technique is actually more important
202

202

00:11:43.431  -->  00:11:46.643
when we have large amounts of code to compress,
203

203

00:11:46.643  -->  00:11:49.392
because otherwise we will not save so much space.
204

204

00:11:49.392  -->  00:11:52.186
And in our case, we don't have that much code,
205

205

00:11:52.186  -->  00:11:55.436
so it's maybe not necessary to do this.
206

206

00:11:57.210  -->  00:12:00.740
All right, that's it for optimizing page speed
207

207

00:12:00.740  -->  00:12:02.922
and now let's move on to some very basic
208

208

00:12:02.922  -->  00:12:06.672
search engine optimizing in the next lecture.
