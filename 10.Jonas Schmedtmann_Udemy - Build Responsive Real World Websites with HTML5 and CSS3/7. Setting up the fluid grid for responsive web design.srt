00:00:02,482  -->  00:00:04,284
<v Voiceover>Let's take a small break</v>
2

2

00:00:04,284  -->  00:00:08,315
and talk about a very important thing in modern web design,
3

3

00:00:08,315  -->  00:00:10,428
responsive web design.
4

4

00:00:10,428  -->  00:00:13,142
You have probably heard of it by now.
5

5

00:00:13,142  -->  00:00:16,263
So, in this lecture we will set up our project
6

6

00:00:16,263  -->  00:00:20,346
to that we can easily build a responsive website.
7

7

00:00:21,789  -->  00:00:25,089
So, what is responsive web design?
8

8

00:00:25,089  -->  00:00:29,055
Building a responsive website means that that website
9

9

00:00:29,055  -->  00:00:31,022
will work well on any device
10

10

00:00:31,022  -->  00:00:33,785
and with any screen resolution.
11

11

00:00:33,785  -->  00:00:38,011
Working well means that that website is easy to read
12

12

00:00:38,011  -->  00:00:41,132
and to navigate without needing to constantly zoom in
13

13

00:00:41,132  -->  00:00:44,350
and zoom out, which is really annoying.
14

14

00:00:44,350  -->  00:00:48,933
Here are just two examples of responsive websites.
15

15

00:00:48,933  -->  00:00:52,737
You can see that they change with the browser's width
16

16

00:00:52,737  -->  00:00:56,183
which means that they respond to the screen size;
17

17

00:00:56,183  -->  00:01:00,035
therefore, the name responsive web design.
18

18

00:01:00,035  -->  00:01:04,277
According to Google, 50% of all internet traffic
19

19

00:01:04,277  -->  00:01:07,024
already happens on mobile phones
20

20

00:01:07,024  -->  00:01:10,015
and this will even increase in the future.
21

21

00:01:10,015  -->  00:01:12,681
In fact, Google recently announced
22

22

00:01:12,681  -->  00:01:16,061
that mobile-friendly websites will be ranked higher
23

23

00:01:16,061  -->  00:01:19,166
on their Search Results page.
24

24

00:01:19,166  -->  00:01:21,376
So, it's really important
25

25

00:01:21,376  -->  00:01:24,959
to embrace responsive web design right now.
26

26

00:01:27,309  -->  00:01:29,942
So, there are three main ingredients
27

27

00:01:29,942  -->  00:01:32,527
to responsive web design.
28

28

00:01:32,527  -->  00:01:34,527
First is the fluid grid.
29

29

00:01:35,509  -->  00:01:39,053
In a fluid grid all layout elements are sized
30

30

00:01:39,053  -->  00:01:41,773
in relative units like percentages
31

31

00:01:41,773  -->  00:01:45,719
instead of absolute units like pixels.
32

32

00:01:45,719  -->  00:01:48,842
in the CSS section we used a static layout
33

33

00:01:48,842  -->  00:01:51,342
and defined width with pixels.
34

34

00:01:52,960  -->  00:01:57,443
Now we are leaving that behind and work with percentages.
35

35

00:01:57,443  -->  00:02:00,943
We will set up the fluid grid in a minute.
36

36

00:02:02,736  -->  00:02:06,343
And the same goes for images so as to prevent them
37

37

00:02:06,343  -->  00:02:10,940
from displaying outside their parent elements.
38

38

00:02:10,940  -->  00:02:14,427
And finally, media queries allow us to specify
39

39

00:02:14,427  -->  00:02:18,431
different CSS rules for different browser width.
40

40

00:02:18,431  -->  00:02:21,706
With media queries we can target different devices
41

41

00:02:21,706  -->  00:02:23,928
like mobile phones and tablets
42

42

00:02:23,928  -->  00:02:28,095
and make the website respond to their screen size.
43

43

00:02:29,522  -->  00:02:31,821
So, now that we know the main ingredients
44

44

00:02:31,821  -->  00:02:35,384
to responsive web design let's go back to brackets
45

45

00:02:35,384  -->  00:02:37,551
and set up the fluid grid.
46

46

00:02:38,756  -->  00:02:41,706
We will then build our website using that grid
47

47

00:02:41,706  -->  00:02:44,062
in the next lectures.
48

48

00:02:44,062  -->  00:02:47,357
We will take care of the media queries part later
49

49

00:02:47,357  -->  00:02:49,541
after building our webpage.
50

50

00:02:49,541  -->  00:02:51,801
While we build the webpage it's just important
51

51

00:02:51,801  -->  00:02:54,134
that we always use the grid.
52

52

00:02:56,054  -->  00:02:59,559
Now, the fluid grid we will use in this course
53

53

00:02:59,559  -->  00:03:03,697
is based on this little responsive grid system,
54

54

00:03:03,697  -->  00:03:07,864
which claims to be spectacularly easy responsive web design.
55

55

00:03:10,210  -->  00:03:12,892
So you can build any layout you can imagine
56

56

00:03:12,892  -->  00:03:15,115
with this fluid grid.
57

57

00:03:15,115  -->  00:03:19,444
I actually made some changes that makes things easier for us
58

58

00:03:19,444  -->  00:03:22,854
and compiled everything in one file.
59

59

00:03:22,854  -->  00:03:24,654
Please go download that file
60

60

00:03:24,654  -->  00:03:28,486
from the lecture description right now.
61

61

00:03:28,486  -->  00:03:31,819
We will come back to this website later
62

62

00:03:31,819  -->  00:03:35,133
so I can show you how that grid works.
63

63

00:03:35,133  -->  00:03:38,485
So I hope you downloaded the file by now.
64

64

00:03:38,485  -->  00:03:41,742
I actually already have it here on my desktop
65

65

00:03:41,742  -->  00:03:43,242
so I will copy it.
66

66

00:03:46,359  -->  00:03:49,730
And then we put it in the Vendors folder
67

67

00:03:49,730  -->  00:03:53,945
because once again it's a file that we got from the internet
68

68

00:03:53,945  -->  00:03:56,195
and then in the CSS folder.
69

69

00:03:58,197  -->  00:04:00,197
And here we go, alright.
70

70

00:04:04,308  -->  00:04:06,339
So now back to brackets.
71

71

00:04:06,339  -->  00:04:08,339
Let's include that file.
72

72

00:04:12,067  -->  00:04:13,637
I'll do it here.
73

73

00:04:13,637  -->  00:04:17,804
Again, before the style CSS, which is our CSS file,
74

74

00:04:20,266  -->  00:04:23,369
and let me just tell you another trick
75

75

00:04:23,369  -->  00:04:24,536
which is I can
76

76

00:04:25,898  -->  00:04:28,963
since I don't want to write all of this again
77

77

00:04:28,963  -->  00:04:31,894
and instead of copying which is a little annoying
78

78

00:04:31,894  -->  00:04:32,977
I can just do
79

79

00:04:35,093  -->  00:04:37,142
duplicate, which is Command + D
80

80

00:04:37,142  -->  00:04:40,475
or probably Control + D on Windows.
81

81

00:04:41,817  -->  00:04:45,984
So right here just Command + D and here we go.
82

82

00:04:47,295  -->  00:04:51,045
'Cause all I want to change now is this file.
83

83

00:04:52,583  -->  00:04:55,341
So I want the grid file, right.
84

84

00:04:55,341  -->  00:04:59,341
So now the grid file is included in our project.
85

85

00:05:00,743  -->  00:05:04,076
Now let me show you how that grid works.
86

86

00:05:05,360  -->  00:05:08,610
So on this website is a little example.
87

87

00:05:10,283  -->  00:05:13,783
So all our content will be inside columns,
88

88

00:05:16,011  -->  00:05:17,639
as you can see here.
89

89

00:05:17,639  -->  00:05:21,306
And each of these group of columns is a row.
90

90

00:05:22,907  -->  00:05:26,892
So in each row we can have two or three or four or five
91

91

00:05:26,892  -->  00:05:29,612
all the way to 12 columns
92

92

00:05:29,612  -->  00:05:32,112
which all have the same width.
93

93

00:05:34,248  -->  00:05:36,911
And now as for the responsive part,
94

94

00:05:36,911  -->  00:05:39,554
if we resize the browser window
95

95

00:05:39,554  -->  00:05:41,054
all of them shrink
96

96

00:05:42,811  -->  00:05:46,978
and that means that they are defined with a relative width
97

97

00:05:48,443  -->  00:05:51,623
because their width is always relative
98

98

00:05:51,623  -->  00:05:53,456
to the browser window.
99

99

00:05:54,784  -->  00:05:56,929
So they get smaller and smaller
100

100

00:05:56,929  -->  00:05:59,343
as I decrease the browser window.
101

101

00:05:59,343  -->  00:06:02,810
And that's what responsive web design is all about.
102

102

00:06:02,810  -->  00:06:05,727
And after a certain amount of width
103

103

00:06:07,197  -->  00:06:08,998
they even stack.
104

104

00:06:08,998  -->  00:06:12,791
So when they get too small we can't see any content
105

105

00:06:12,791  -->  00:06:14,745
in this column here, right?
106

106

00:06:14,745  -->  00:06:17,541
Then they will all stack
107

107

00:06:17,541  -->  00:06:18,710
just like this.
108

108

00:06:18,710  -->  00:06:21,871
In our website, since we will use this grid,
109

109

00:06:21,871  -->  00:06:23,371
we'll do the same.
110

110

00:06:26,085  -->  00:06:29,085
Okay, so then let's see the CSS file
111

111

00:06:32,848  -->  00:06:36,775
that we just included and it's down here.
112

112

00:06:36,775  -->  00:06:38,958
Let me just open it.
113

113

00:06:38,958  -->  00:06:41,698
And if I click it twice, double click,
114

114

00:06:41,698  -->  00:06:46,180
then it appears up here in the working files.
115

115

00:06:46,180  -->  00:06:47,513
So we have a row
116

116

00:06:50,946  -->  00:06:51,863
and columns
117

117

00:06:53,532  -->  00:06:55,927
and then different spans
118

118

00:06:55,927  -->  00:06:59,177
and each of this span will be a column.
119

119

00:07:01,578  -->  00:07:04,245
For example this span one of two
120

120

00:07:05,237  -->  00:07:06,570
is just columns.
121

121

00:07:08,915  -->  00:07:13,225
But don't worry, we will use that in the next lecture
122

122

00:07:13,225  -->  00:07:16,559
and then you will understand everything
123

123

00:07:16,559  -->  00:07:18,226
just how this works.
124

124

00:07:19,221  -->  00:07:22,638
Alright, let's get back to our HTML file.
125

125

00:07:24,662  -->  00:07:28,245
And as I said, the content will be in rows.
126

126

00:07:29,451  -->  00:07:31,784
So let's just define the row
127

127

00:07:33,263  -->  00:07:36,271
and I will simply call it row.
128

128

00:07:36,271  -->  00:07:38,646
And what I want for this row
129

129

00:07:38,646  -->  00:07:40,146
is a maximum width
130

130

00:07:43,151  -->  00:07:44,401
of 1,140 pixels
131

131

00:07:47,442  -->  00:07:50,775
just as we used in our previous project.
132

132

00:07:52,576  -->  00:07:54,074
So this is the only value
133

133

00:07:54,074  -->  00:07:57,752
that will have an absolute value in pixels.
134

134

00:07:57,752  -->  00:08:00,070
We will define all other layout margins
135

135

00:08:00,070  -->  00:08:02,235
in pettings and percentages
136

136

00:08:02,235  -->  00:08:04,266
and not in pixels.
137

137

00:08:04,266  -->  00:08:07,433
And now I also want to center this row
138

138

00:08:08,633  -->  00:08:12,633
on the webpage so all our rows will be centered.
139

139

00:08:15,491  -->  00:08:18,408
So do you remember how we did that?
140

140

00:08:19,572  -->  00:08:21,786
We'll just set margin
141

141

00:08:21,786  -->  00:08:24,286
and then to center a container
142

142

00:08:26,809  -->  00:08:28,456
inside another container
143

143

00:08:28,456  -->  00:08:33,035
as you remember we set the left margin to auto
144

144

00:08:33,035  -->  00:08:35,985
and the right margin to auto.
145

145

00:08:35,985  -->  00:08:37,690
You probably also remember
146

146

00:08:37,690  -->  00:08:41,923
that we can use a shorthand to set margins just like this.
147

147

00:08:41,923  -->  00:08:43,006
Top and right
148

148

00:08:45,088  -->  00:08:46,755
and bottom and left.
149

149

00:08:48,632  -->  00:08:52,799
Alright, but there's an even simpler way of doing this.
150

150

00:08:54,934  -->  00:08:58,363
So let me show you that as well.
151

151

00:08:58,363  -->  00:09:01,113
Which is we can say zero and auto
152

152

00:09:02,501  -->  00:09:05,010
and then top and bottom will be zero
153

153

00:09:05,010  -->  00:09:07,677
and left and right will be auto.
154

154

00:09:09,340  -->  00:09:10,840
Let me delete this
155

155

00:09:12,117  -->  00:09:14,684
and now this row will be centered.
156

156

00:09:14,684  -->  00:09:16,851
You can just try this out.
157

157

00:09:20,201  -->  00:09:23,368
So I'll say div and class will be row.
158

158

00:09:29,262  -->  00:09:31,429
Alright, just put us here.
159

159

00:09:36,312  -->  00:09:39,818
And let's see how this looks like.
160

160

00:09:39,818  -->  00:09:42,691
Okay, you'll see it's perfectly centered.
161

161

00:09:42,691  -->  00:09:45,047
So now we have everything in place
162

162

00:09:45,047  -->  00:09:49,214
so we can start building the first section of our webpage
163

163

00:09:50,085  -->  00:09:52,168
which will be the header.
164

164

00:09:54,377  -->  00:09:58,294
So don't wait, and join me in the next lecture.
