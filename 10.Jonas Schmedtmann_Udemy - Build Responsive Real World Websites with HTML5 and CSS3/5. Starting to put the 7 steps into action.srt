00:00:01,779  -->  00:00:04,218
<v Voiceover>It's now time to start our project.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,218  -->  00:00:05,885
This is so exciting.
3

3

00:00:07,472  -->  00:00:10,633
So let me introduce OMNIFOOD to you.
4

4

00:00:10,633  -->  00:00:13,009
OMNIFOOD is a fictional company,
5

5

00:00:13,009  -->  00:00:16,404
I made up only for this course.
6

6

00:00:16,404  -->  00:00:19,512
OMNIFOOD is a premium food delivery company,
7

7

00:00:19,512  -->  00:00:22,590
devoted to bring healthy and affordable meals,
8

8

00:00:22,590  -->  00:00:25,236
to people in currently four cities.
9

9

00:00:25,236  -->  00:00:28,962
Now, they need a new, modern and clean website
10

10

00:00:28,962  -->  00:00:33,788
that will make them look like a really professional company.
11

11

00:00:33,788  -->  00:00:36,656
And that is where we come in.
12

12

00:00:36,656  -->  00:00:39,392
We are going to do exactly that.
13

13

00:00:39,392  -->  00:00:43,584
Together we will pretend that we were hired by OMNIFOOD
14

14

00:00:43,584  -->  00:00:47,707
to design and develop the visual part of their website
15

15

00:00:47,707  -->  00:00:50,957
using HTML, Syntax and a little jQuery.
16

16

00:00:51,845  -->  00:00:53,178
Isn't that fun?
17

17

00:00:54,422  -->  00:00:56,105
It's like first job.
18

18

00:00:56,105  -->  00:00:58,938
I mean, this is really cool right?
19

19

00:00:59,804  -->  00:01:02,315
And they actually provide us with all the content
20

20

00:01:02,315  -->  00:01:05,812
that you can and should download right now
21

21

00:01:05,812  -->  00:01:08,562
from the link in the description.
22

22

00:01:10,161  -->  00:01:13,818
Now, based on what OMNIFOOD wants from us.
23

23

00:01:13,818  -->  00:01:16,287
We will start to put the seven step plan
24

24

00:01:16,287  -->  00:01:18,320
we discussed before,
25

25

00:01:18,320  -->  00:01:19,153
in action.
26

26

00:01:22,086  -->  00:01:24,336
So, starting with step one.
27

27

00:01:25,253  -->  00:01:26,943
As you probably remember,
28

28

00:01:26,943  -->  00:01:30,232
step one is all about defining the project.
29

29

00:01:30,232  -->  00:01:33,967
So the goal of the project is to show what OMNIFOOD does.
30

30

00:01:33,967  -->  00:01:35,274
How it works.
31

31

00:01:35,274  -->  00:01:38,810
And in which city it operates in.
32

32

00:01:38,810  -->  00:01:43,093
Then, make people sign up on a subscription plan.
33

33

00:01:43,093  -->  00:01:46,906
And is actually a pretty common project goal.
34

34

00:01:46,906  -->  00:01:50,687
And the audience for this project is busy people
35

35

00:01:50,687  -->  00:01:54,437
who don't have time to cook or don't like to cook.
36

36

00:01:54,437  -->  00:01:55,687
Simple as that.
37

37

00:01:58,418  -->  00:02:02,409
Now step two was about planning the website.
38

38

00:02:02,409  -->  00:02:05,246
We will build a one page web page,
39

39

00:02:05,246  -->  00:02:09,152
containing all the information provided by OMNIFOOD
40

40

00:02:09,152  -->  00:02:13,319
With a simple navigation to guide us through the page.
41

41

00:02:14,325  -->  00:02:16,966
And the content was provided by OMNIFOOD
42

42

00:02:16,966  -->  00:02:19,849
in the form of a text document and couple of images
43

43

00:02:19,849  -->  00:02:24,376
that you already downloaded to your computer.
44

44

00:02:24,376  -->  00:02:26,101
And navigation was also provided
45

45

00:02:26,101  -->  00:02:29,726
by OMNIFOOD in that text document.
46

46

00:02:29,726  -->  00:02:33,887
We will look at all of that once we start building.
47

47

00:02:33,887  -->  00:02:37,218
And a side map, it's not necessary in this case,
48

48

00:02:37,218  -->  00:02:39,110
because we are talking about
49

49

00:02:39,110  -->  00:02:42,610
a relatively small one page website here.
50

50

00:02:45,070  -->  00:02:49,098
The next step is to get inspired and sketch some ideas.
51

51

00:02:49,098  -->  00:02:51,933
Here is what I did for our project.
52

52

00:02:51,933  -->  00:02:53,537
So we'll show you some sketches
53

53

00:02:53,537  -->  00:02:56,743
for the nine different sections of the website.
54

54

00:02:56,743  -->  00:03:00,826
Starting with the header and the feature section.
55

55

00:03:02,874  -->  00:03:05,594
You can clearly see that I'm really bad
56

56

00:03:05,594  -->  00:03:07,351
at drawing and sketching.
57

57

00:03:07,351  -->  00:03:11,518
But I try my best because this step is really important.
58

58

00:03:14,055  -->  00:03:16,976
And as I said before it really doesn't matter
59

59

00:03:16,976  -->  00:03:19,647
if your sketches look good or bad.
60

60

00:03:19,647  -->  00:03:23,814
We just want to get an idea of what we want to build.
61

61

00:03:26,181  -->  00:03:29,022
So these different sections I sketched here
62

62

00:03:29,022  -->  00:03:32,845
follow exactly the content OMNIFOOD gave us.
63

63

00:03:32,845  -->  00:03:34,984
You can take a look at the document
64

64

00:03:34,984  -->  00:03:39,067
and compare it with the sketches I show you here.
65

65

00:03:40,607  -->  00:03:43,569
As we design each of these nine sections.
66

66

00:03:43,569  -->  00:03:47,569
I will show you my sketches with greater detail.
67

67

00:03:49,105  -->  00:03:50,605
And now step four.
68

68

00:03:51,529  -->  00:03:54,117
This is where all the fun begins.
69

69

00:03:54,117  -->  00:03:59,014
In step four, we finally design and develop our website.
70

70

00:03:59,014  -->  00:04:00,743
This will take us from this lecture,
71

71

00:04:00,743  -->  00:04:03,543
all until the end of section six.
72

72

00:04:03,543  -->  00:04:06,750
This is because actually designing and developing
73

73

00:04:06,750  -->  00:04:11,074
the web page is of course, what matters the most.
74

74

00:04:11,074  -->  00:04:13,374
So for the design, I will start
75

75

00:04:13,374  -->  00:04:15,513
by defining two essential things.
76

76

00:04:15,513  -->  00:04:16,930
Colors and fonts.
77

77

00:04:18,968  -->  00:04:23,408
As for the color, I'm going with an orange tone here.
78

78

00:04:23,408  -->  00:04:26,863
We will use the flat UI colors that I showed you before,
79

79

00:04:26,863  -->  00:04:29,743
to decide the exactly which orange tone
80

80

00:04:29,743  -->  00:04:32,089
when we first need to use it.
81

81

00:04:32,089  -->  00:04:35,764
Remember what I said about orange earlier.
82

82

00:04:35,764  -->  00:04:37,938
It can be associated with friendliness,
83

83

00:04:37,938  -->  00:04:39,855
confidence and courage.
84

84

00:04:40,893  -->  00:04:42,967
Well this is exactly the kind of things
85

85

00:04:42,967  -->  00:04:46,078
I want our web page to transmit to the user
86

86

00:04:46,078  -->  00:04:50,245
in order to make him or her sign up for a subscription plan.
87

87

00:04:51,101  -->  00:04:54,018
And of course, it also looks great.
88

88

00:04:56,322  -->  00:04:57,804
Now as for the font.
89

89

00:04:57,804  -->  00:05:01,345
I showed you some great Google fonts before.
90

90

00:05:01,345  -->  00:05:03,428
We are going to use LATO.
91

91

00:05:04,387  -->  00:05:08,298
In my opinion, LATO looks really good.
92

92

00:05:08,298  -->  00:05:10,933
The semi-rounded details of the letters,
93

93

00:05:10,933  -->  00:05:14,382
give the typeface a feeling of warmth.
94

94

00:05:14,382  -->  00:05:15,655
While the strong structure,
95

95

00:05:15,655  -->  00:05:18,572
provides stability and seriousness.
96

96

00:05:19,522  -->  00:05:21,824
According to the designer of this font,
97

97

00:05:21,824  -->  00:05:26,023
it is male and female, serious but friendly.
98

98

00:05:26,023  -->  00:05:28,529
With the feeling of the summer.
99

99

00:05:28,529  -->  00:05:31,157
Well given our project and it's audience,
100

100

00:05:31,157  -->  00:05:36,139
it feels like this is a perfect font for our web page.
101

101

00:05:36,139  -->  00:05:38,937
Actually, all the presentations you've been seeing
102

102

00:05:38,937  -->  00:05:42,604
in this course also use this type face LATO.
103

103

00:05:44,322  -->  00:05:47,404
Now having these design decisions in mind,
104

104

00:05:47,404  -->  00:05:49,747
let's finally go back to brackets
105

105

00:05:49,747  -->  00:05:52,216
and start to code our project.
106

106

00:05:52,216  -->  00:05:53,383
See you there.
