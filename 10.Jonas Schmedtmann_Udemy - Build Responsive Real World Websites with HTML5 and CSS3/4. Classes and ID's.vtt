<v Voiceover>Now that we're familiar with colors,</v>
2

2

00:00:03.701  -->  00:00:06.886 line:15% 
we are going to talk about two new selectors,
3

3

00:00:06.886  -->  00:00:08.219 line:15% 
classes and IDs.
4

4

00:00:10.427  -->  00:00:15.294
In the last lecture, we used H1, H2, P, and buddy selectors,
5

5

00:00:15.294  -->  00:00:18.986
to select the corresponding HTML elements.
6

6

00:00:18.986  -->  00:00:22.398
But now, suppose you wanted to style only one
7

7

00:00:22.398  -->  00:00:25.046
of the paragraphs, not all of them.
8

8

00:00:25.046  -->  00:00:27.963
That's why we have classes and IDs.
9

9

00:00:29.202  -->  00:00:32.826
We can attribute class or ID names to elements
10

10

00:00:32.826  -->  00:00:36.470
and then use these classes or IDs to select them
11

11

00:00:36.470  -->  00:00:38.606
in the CSS code.
12

12

00:00:38.606  -->  00:00:40.357
So let's do that.
13

13

00:00:40.357  -->  00:00:44.237
First, I need to tell you that the same class can
14

14

00:00:44.237  -->  00:00:47.649
be attributed to as many elements as you like,
15

15

00:00:47.649  -->  00:00:51.816
while an ID can be used only once inside each HTML document.
16

16

00:00:54.037  -->  00:00:56.787
So let's see what we can do here.
17

17

00:00:57.868  -->  00:01:02.035
So, we have three paragraph elements, if you remember.
18

18

00:01:03.787  -->  00:01:07.943
It's this paragraph, this paragraph here, and also
19

19

00:01:07.943  -->  00:01:11.543
the author name is also a paragraph.
20

20

00:01:11.543  -->  00:01:15.559
So now let's say we want the author paragraph to be bigger
21

21

00:01:15.559  -->  00:01:17.142
than the main text.
22

22

00:01:19.439  -->  00:01:22.875
So we have two text paragraphs, and we can use classes
23

23

00:01:22.875  -->  00:01:23.708
for that.
24

24

00:01:23.708  -->  00:01:27.041
So let's go back to our index HTML file.
25

25

00:01:30.789  -->  00:01:32.122
Just close this.
26

26

00:01:36.040  -->  00:01:40.123
And so, here in the P tag, just add class, class,
27

27

00:01:43.772  -->  00:01:46.072
and then choose a name.
28

28

00:01:46.072  -->  00:01:48.348
It can be anything.
29

29

00:01:48.348  -->  00:01:50.765
I will call this "main text".
30

30

00:01:53.340  -->  00:01:56.660
And then, the same thing with the second paragraph.
31

31

00:01:56.660  -->  00:01:59.327
This is also "main text," right?
32

32

00:02:02.420  -->  00:02:03.753
So, "main text."
33

33

00:02:05.880  -->  00:02:10.312
Now, there's only one paragraph for the author name,
34

34

00:02:10.312  -->  00:02:12.395
so we can use an ID here.
35

35

00:02:14.724  -->  00:02:18.891
So it's just, as you can imagine, "ID", and I will call it
36

36

00:02:20.856  -->  00:02:22.106
"author texts".
37

37

00:02:27.080  -->  00:02:30.888
And now, let's go back to our CSS file.
38

38

00:02:30.888  -->  00:02:35.055
And here, down here, we can now add the new selectors.
39

39

00:02:36.344  -->  00:02:39.804
So, style the paragraphs with the "main text" class.
40

40

00:02:39.804  -->  00:02:40.971
We'll add dot,
41

41

00:02:42.904  -->  00:02:43.737
main text.
42

42

00:02:48.247  -->  00:02:51.948
And you see, on the right page, with the live connection,
43

43

00:02:51.948  -->  00:02:56.128
two brackets, that there's a blue square around
44

44

00:02:56.128  -->  00:02:59.192
this paragraph, and the other one too,
45

45

00:02:59.192  -->  00:03:02.560
but not the author paragraph, which means that we
46

46

00:03:02.560  -->  00:03:04.893
selected these two elements.
47

47

00:03:07.983  -->  00:03:12.646
What I can do here is to say that we want these paragraphs
48

48

00:03:12.646  -->  00:03:15.229
to have a justified text align.
49

49

00:03:16.894  -->  00:03:18.644
Text, align, justify.
50

50

00:03:23.773  -->  00:03:27.856
And now, down here, we have the author paragraph,
51

51

00:03:28.789  -->  00:03:31.456
if you remember, and it's an ID.
52

52

00:03:33.938  -->  00:03:38.467
And to select that ID, we use the hash symbol and say,
53

53

00:03:38.467  -->  00:03:39.300
"author
54

54

00:03:41.439  -->  00:03:42.272
text."
55

55

00:03:46.233  -->  00:03:50.393
All right, and as we said, we want this to have a larger
56

56

00:03:50.393  -->  00:03:53.143
font size, like 22 pixels, maybe.
57

57

00:03:55.245  -->  00:03:59.412
Font size, we'll set it to 22 pixels, and you see,
58

58

00:04:00.493  -->  00:04:04.660
it's bigger now, and, yeah, 22 pixels looks just right.
59

59

00:04:09.586  -->  00:04:11.169
So, nice, it works.
60

60

00:04:12.450  -->  00:04:14.702
We actually don't need this one anymore,
61

61

00:04:14.702  -->  00:04:18.090
it's kind of redundant, because, in this rule,
62

62

00:04:18.090  -->  00:04:21.690
I already said that I want these two paragraphs
63

63

00:04:21.690  -->  00:04:25.314
to be justified, and since this one doesn't need
64

64

00:04:25.314  -->  00:04:28.866
to be justified, I can just delete this,
65

65

00:04:28.866  -->  00:04:30.866
and nothing will happen.
66

66

00:04:31.882  -->  00:04:34.486
Let's clear some lines, save it,
67

67

00:04:34.486  -->  00:04:36.236
never forget to save.
68

68

00:04:37.416  -->  00:04:41.035
And yeah, I think that's it for the coding.
69

69

00:04:41.035  -->  00:04:45.003
Now using IDs is actually not a good practice,
70

70

00:04:45.003  -->  00:04:47.327
because, I said, they can only be used once.
71

71

00:04:47.327  -->  00:04:51.643
So, usually, we use classes for all our styling,
72

72

00:04:51.643  -->  00:04:55.291
even if we have only one class with a specific name,
73

73

00:04:55.291  -->  00:04:58.495
because we will never know what will happen to our code
74

74

00:04:58.495  -->  00:04:59.662
down the road.
75

75

00:05:01.071  -->  00:05:05.238
So let's just quickly change from ID to class right here
76

76

00:05:06.643  -->  00:05:08.131
first.
77

77

00:05:08.131  -->  00:05:12.298
I want this to be a class, and then I will also change it
78

78

00:05:14.283  -->  00:05:18.450
in the CSS, and now it's back to normal as we want it.
79

79

00:05:21.014  -->  00:05:21.923
Great!
80

80

00:05:21.923  -->  00:05:24.479
This was an important lecture because we'll be using
81

81

00:05:24.479  -->  00:05:26.823
classes all the time.
82

82

00:05:26.823  -->  00:05:30.119
Next up, I will teach you another very important
83

83

00:05:30.119  -->  00:05:31.651
thing in CSS:
84

84

00:05:31.651  -->  00:05:33.535
the so-called Vox Model.
85

85

00:05:33.535  -->  00:05:34.702
See you there.
