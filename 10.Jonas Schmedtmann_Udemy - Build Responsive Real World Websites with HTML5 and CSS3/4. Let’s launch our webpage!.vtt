00:00:01.288  -->  00:00:02.945
<v Voiceover>Our website is now ready</v>
2

2

00:00:02.945  -->  00:00:05.383
to be shared with the world.
3

3

00:00:05.383  -->  00:00:07.475
We have come such a long way so far
4

4

00:00:07.475  -->  00:00:10.142
and now we're almost at the end.
5

5

00:00:11.681  -->  00:00:14.226
So launching our website is step six
6

6

00:00:14.226  -->  00:00:17.193
out of our seven step plan.
7

7

00:00:17.193  -->  00:00:18.859
This is super easy to do.
8

8

00:00:18.859  -->  00:00:22.276
We just need to follow these three steps.
9

9

00:00:23.192  -->  00:00:26.674
First, we need to choose and buy a domain name.
10

10

00:00:26.674  -->  00:00:30.591
For our website that could be www.omnifood.com.
11

11

00:00:33.253  -->  00:00:35.808
Then we need to buy web hosting.
12

12

00:00:35.808  -->  00:00:38.978
Think of that as a folder in the internet
13

13

00:00:38.978  -->  00:00:41.769
where we'll put all our files.
14

14

00:00:41.769  -->  00:00:45.537
In order to ensure that our website runs smoothly,
15

15

00:00:45.537  -->  00:00:48.031
we need the right amount of ban width
16

16

00:00:48.031  -->  00:00:51.153
and that is the amount of data transfer we are allowed
17

17

00:00:51.153  -->  00:00:53.570
within a certain time period.
18

18

00:00:54.926  -->  00:00:57.640
And once we have both of those things,
19

19

00:00:57.640  -->  00:01:01.003
we just need to upload our website to our web space.
20

20

00:01:01.003  -->  00:01:03.761
And then we're ready to go.
21

21

00:01:03.761  -->  00:01:07.784
Now, there are many, many domain registration companies
22

22

00:01:07.784  -->  00:01:09.997
and web hosting companies.
23

23

00:01:09.997  -->  00:01:13.626
Of course I will not tell you which one you should choose.
24

24

00:01:13.626  -->  00:01:16.954
All I can tell you is that I have used GoDaddy.com
25

25

00:01:16.954  -->  00:01:21.157
to both register domain names and buy web hosting.
26

26

00:01:21.157  -->  00:01:23.483
The service there was always great,
27

27

00:01:23.483  -->  00:01:26.783
but of course I can't tell that it's the best web hosting
28

28

00:01:26.783  -->  00:01:30.950
out there because I have not tried any other service so far.
29

29

00:01:32.795  -->  00:01:35.342
But let me just show you the GoDaddy website
30

30

00:01:35.342  -->  00:01:38.342
and how you could use their product.
31

31

00:01:39.299  -->  00:01:41.127
So this is the GoDaddy website.
32

32

00:01:41.127  -->  00:01:44.627
In here we can start by search for domain.
33

33

00:01:45.593  -->  00:01:47.676
Let me say omnifood here.
34

34

00:01:55.414  -->  00:02:00.229
So omnifood.com is available and there's an auction for
35

35

00:02:00.229  -->  00:02:02.062
like almost 800 euros.
36

36

00:02:04.381  -->  00:02:08.021
But there are other domain names available like
37

37

00:02:08.021  -->  00:02:11.604
omnifood.net, omnifood.co, or omnifood.org.
38

38

00:02:14.876  -->  00:02:18.800
Well, again, I will of course not buy any of those
39

39

00:02:18.800  -->  00:02:22.036
domain names and I will not show you how you can create
40

40

00:02:22.036  -->  00:02:26.225
an account here or how you can buy a domain names
41

41

00:02:26.225  -->  00:02:28.258
and all of that.
42

42

00:02:28.258  -->  00:02:31.225
If you want to do that just go ahead.
43

43

00:02:31.225  -->  00:02:35.392
It's easy to do and in GoDaddy you can actually buy the
44

44

00:02:37.115  -->  00:02:40.244
domain and the web space as well.
45

45

00:02:40.244  -->  00:02:42.735
So now suppose you created an account
46

46

00:02:42.735  -->  00:02:46.067
and have now a domain and some web space.
47

47

00:02:46.067  -->  00:02:49.610
Now you want to upload your website, right?
48

48

00:02:49.610  -->  00:02:51.350
So to show you how this works,
49

49

00:02:51.350  -->  00:02:55.302
in this video I will upload the website we just created
50

50

00:02:55.302  -->  00:02:57.901
to the web hosting that I bought for the website
51

51

00:02:57.901  -->  00:03:01.401
of this course, which is this, by the way.
52

52

00:03:08.269  -->  00:03:11.186
So it is under construction so far.
53

53

00:03:12.554  -->  00:03:16.251
So if you have created an account at GoDaddy,
54

54

00:03:16.251  -->  00:03:19.751
then you can very easily log in to cPanel,
55

55

00:03:21.299  -->  00:03:23.288
which is where we can manage our account
56

56

00:03:23.288  -->  00:03:26.871
and the web space and everything like that.
57

57

00:03:30.143  -->  00:03:35.074
So let me just log in here to show you how this looks like.
58

58

00:03:35.074  -->  00:03:38.310
Alright, so here we have all kind of stuff.
59

59

00:03:38.310  -->  00:03:42.477
For example we can create email accounts and we can
60

60

00:03:43.601  -->  00:03:46.637
manage all kinds of things here.
61

61

00:03:46.637  -->  00:03:49.154
You see you can there explore by yourself
62

62

00:03:49.154  -->  00:03:52.067
but what we need for now is first I want to show you
63

63

00:03:52.067  -->  00:03:53.484
the file manager.
64

64

00:03:56.448  -->  00:04:00.615
Which is as i said before, like a folder in the the internet
65

65

00:04:03.151  -->  00:04:06.234
where we will then put all our stuff.
66

66

00:04:07.233  -->  00:04:11.236
And the folder, so this is our folder and the
67

67

00:04:11.236  -->  00:04:15.403
website goes inside the public html folder right here.
68

68

00:04:17.804  -->  00:04:20.629
So how do we upload those files here?
69

69

00:04:20.629  -->  00:04:23.297
We can actually do that inside of brackets.
70

70

00:04:23.297  -->  00:04:25.605
So in brackets there is an extension
71

71

00:04:25.605  -->  00:04:27.855
that we can use to do that.
72

72

00:04:29.641  -->  00:04:33.224
And all we need for that is an FTP account.
73

73

00:04:34.088  -->  00:04:36.970
So FTP means file transfer protocol
74

74

00:04:36.970  -->  00:04:40.937
and this is how we upload files to a web space.
75

75

00:04:40.937  -->  00:04:44.895
So down here you're probably already have an account,
76

76

00:04:44.895  -->  00:04:47.296
if you don't then you can create one,
77

77

00:04:47.296  -->  00:04:50.047
but you probably have one.
78

78

00:04:50.047  -->  00:04:53.475
So this information here is all we need
79

79

00:04:53.475  -->  00:04:57.191
to upload our website to the internet.
80

80

00:04:57.191  -->  00:05:00.018
So let's go back to bracket,
81

81

00:05:00.018  -->  00:05:03.472
where I will show you a very cool extension.
82

82

00:05:03.472  -->  00:05:04.305
One more.
83

83

00:05:05.279  -->  00:05:08.279
So this one is called FTP Snyc Plus.
84

84

00:05:09.778  -->  00:05:13.105
So you can just go ahead and install that.
85

85

00:05:13.105  -->  00:05:15.438
As always I already have it.
86

86

00:05:16.513  -->  00:05:19.671
And then once you have it installed
87

87

00:05:19.671  -->  00:05:22.171
just hit this icon right here.
88

88

00:05:23.652  -->  00:05:27.819
Alright and now we need those definitions from the FTP.
89

89

00:05:29.450  -->  00:05:32.867
So FTP, and now we need the informations.
90

90

00:05:34.853  -->  00:05:38.351
So we hit here, configure FTP client
91

91

00:05:38.351  -->  00:05:40.601
and then we have to server.
92

92

00:05:42.733  -->  00:05:44.483
In my case, this one.
93

93

00:05:46.178  -->  00:05:47.761
Then the user name,
94

94

00:05:49.211  -->  00:05:52.961
and then we need to put our password in here.
95

95

00:05:58.184  -->  00:06:00.469
And then the folder where we want this,
96

96

00:06:00.469  -->  00:06:02.469
so as I told you before,
97

97

00:06:03.813  -->  00:06:07.980
I will actually back now, back to the file manager.
98

98

00:06:09.859  -->  00:06:14.700
The public html folder is where the website will go.
99

99

00:06:14.700  -->  00:06:17.328
Now in my case I don't want it to be right here
100

100

00:06:17.328  -->  00:06:21.716
because then I would override all the stuff I already have
101

101

00:06:21.716  -->  00:06:26.309
here in the public html folder, which is my website,
102

102

00:06:26.309  -->  00:06:28.287
which I showed to you before.
103

103

00:06:28.287  -->  00:06:29.287
So this one.
104

104

00:06:30.564  -->  00:06:34.028
This is the stuff that I have already here
105

105

00:06:34.028  -->  00:06:37.125
so I create a new folder where I will put
106

106

00:06:37.125  -->  00:06:41.093
omnifood website just to show you how this works.
107

107

00:06:41.093  -->  00:06:45.260
So we need to write public html and now I will create
108

108

00:06:47.348  -->  00:06:49.931
a new folder here for omnifood.
109

109

00:06:51.846  -->  00:06:55.524
Alright, and then I can hit upload.
110

110

00:06:55.524  -->  00:06:59.426
So it tells me that the folder does not exist
111

111

00:06:59.426  -->  00:07:01.509
so I can easily create it
112

112

00:07:02.471  -->  00:07:04.471
so new folder, omnifood.
113

113

00:07:11.435  -->  00:07:14.069
So I created a new folder here in my web space
114

114

00:07:14.069  -->  00:07:16.569
and now I can just hit upload.
115

115

00:07:19.043  -->  00:07:21.070
So this extension will take all the files and all the
116

116

00:07:21.070  -->  00:07:25.237
folders from our project folder and upload them to
117

117

00:07:26.165  -->  00:07:27.332
our web space.
118

118

00:07:29.342  -->  00:07:32.103
And another cool thing of the extension is that
119

119

00:07:32.103  -->  00:07:36.676
imagine we only change one file and then if we hit upload
120

120

00:07:36.676  -->  00:07:41.264
again here, then it only uploads that exact file.
121

121

00:07:41.264  -->  00:07:45.349
So we can just sit back and watch while brackets does
122

122

00:07:45.349  -->  00:07:46.892
all the work.
123

123

00:07:46.892  -->  00:07:49.892
So it's now uploading all our files.
124

124

00:07:51.598  -->  00:07:55.027
This take a long time so I'll actually make fast forward
125

125

00:07:55.027  -->  00:07:59.194
in this video so we don't have to watch all of this.
126

126

00:08:02.878  -->  00:08:03.960
So that's it.
127

127

00:08:03.960  -->  00:08:07.877
All our files are now uploaded to the internet.
128

128

00:08:09.776  -->  00:08:13.193
So let me open the folder I just created.
129

129

00:08:14.183  -->  00:08:16.183
Omnifood and here we go.
130

130

00:08:20.069  -->  00:08:23.569
Our website is now online on the internet.
131

131

00:08:26.844  -->  00:08:27.927
And it works.
132

132

00:08:30.047  -->  00:08:34.214
I mean it works exactly as we did it here on our computer.
133

133

00:08:36.236  -->  00:08:38.561
So this live version of the website is the
134

134

00:08:38.561  -->  00:08:41.376
production version and the one on the computer
135

135

00:08:41.376  -->  00:08:43.126
is the local version.
136

136

00:08:45.258  -->  00:08:47.547
So now you don't only know how to
137

137

00:08:47.547  -->  00:08:50.247
create a beautiful website,
138

138

00:08:50.247  -->  00:08:52.845
now you also know how to optimize it
139

139

00:08:52.845  -->  00:08:55.928
and how to launch it to the internet.
140

140

00:08:56.983  -->  00:08:59.673
This is absolutely fantastic.
141

141

00:08:59.673  -->  00:09:03.272
Now there's only one more thing left that I want to show you
142

142

00:09:03.272  -->  00:09:07.063
and this about how you can track your users' behavior
143

143

00:09:07.063  -->  00:09:11.230
in order to improve your website even after launching it.
