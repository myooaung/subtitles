00:00:01,301  -->  00:00:05,114
<v Voiceover>Hello there, and welcome to the next section.</v>
2

2

00:00:05,114  -->  00:00:07,371
In this section, we'll use jQuery
3

3

00:00:07,371  -->  00:00:09,795
to add some dynamic effects to our web page
4

4

00:00:09,795  -->  00:00:11,712
over the next lectures.
5

5

00:00:12,971  -->  00:00:14,554
So, what is jQuery?
6

6

00:00:15,897  -->  00:00:19,101
jQuery is by far the most popular JavaScript library
7

7

00:00:19,101  -->  00:00:20,184
in the world.
8

8

00:00:21,275  -->  00:00:25,825
It is completely free and open source software,
9

9

00:00:25,825  -->  00:00:28,890
and jQuery makes it incredibly easy to select
10

10

00:00:28,890  -->  00:00:33,042
and manipulate HTML elements, create animations,
11

11

00:00:33,042  -->  00:00:35,875
or even develop Ajax applications.
12

12

00:00:37,110  -->  00:00:39,506
For example, jQuery can be used for
13

13

00:00:39,506  -->  00:00:42,488
finding an element in a HTML document
14

14

00:00:42,488  -->  00:00:46,472
with a certain property, like all H1 elements,
15

15

00:00:46,472  -->  00:00:50,373
and then changing one or more of its CSS attributes
16

16

00:00:50,373  -->  00:00:54,540
or making it respond to an event like a mouse click.
17

17

00:00:56,475  -->  00:00:59,039
jQuery's architecture allows developers
18

18

00:00:59,039  -->  00:01:03,423
to create plug-ins to extend jQuery's function.
19

19

00:01:03,423  -->  00:01:06,572
There are literally thousands of jQuery plug-ins
20

20

00:01:06,572  -->  00:01:08,773
available on the Internet for free
21

21

00:01:08,773  -->  00:01:12,730
that we can download and include in our websites.
22

22

00:01:12,730  -->  00:01:14,680
The links in the coursebook will help you
23

23

00:01:14,680  -->  00:01:16,513
get started with this.
24

24

00:01:17,578  -->  00:01:21,173
So let me start off by showing you some jQuery plug-ins
25

25

00:01:21,173  -->  00:01:23,736
so that you can see the endless possibilities
26

26

00:01:23,736  -->  00:01:25,403
we have with jQuery.
27

27

00:01:27,387  -->  00:01:29,476
So the first plug-in I'm going to show you
28

28

00:01:29,476  -->  00:01:33,600
is this Magnific Popup, and this is a responsive lightbox
29

29

00:01:33,600  -->  00:01:37,767
and dialogue script where we can create galleries,
30

30

00:01:40,149  -->  00:01:41,816
as you can see here,
31

31

00:01:43,982  -->  00:01:46,808
and these are actually responsive.
32

32

00:01:46,808  -->  00:01:49,725
Or, you can, well this is the same.
33

33

00:01:52,994  -->  00:01:57,453
You can, for instance, open a YouTube video,
34

34

00:01:57,453  -->  00:01:59,203
or open a Google Map,
35

35

00:02:01,194  -->  00:02:03,527
you know, all kinds of stuff
36

36

00:02:04,750  -->  00:02:06,667
which require a pop-up.
37

37

00:02:08,940  -->  00:02:12,857
So even a model dialogue is possible with this.
38

38

00:02:15,461  -->  00:02:19,529
Okay, next up, I have this one called Tooltipster,
39

39

00:02:19,529  -->  00:02:22,928
and this allows us to create these tools tips,
40

40

00:02:22,928  -->  00:02:26,272
which are additional information which we can see
41

41

00:02:26,272  -->  00:02:28,475
when we hover over a certain element.
42

42

00:02:28,475  -->  00:02:32,794
And you have probably seen those somewhere,
43

43

00:02:32,794  -->  00:02:35,961
like all different kinds of tool tips.
44

44

00:02:39,231  -->  00:02:41,981
And, this is kind of easy to use,
45

45

00:02:42,937  -->  00:02:45,974
so we have the instructions down here,
46

46

00:02:45,974  -->  00:02:50,906
and well, you can use this in your project if you want to.
47

47

00:02:50,906  -->  00:02:54,667
And next, is a plug-in called Maplace.Js
48

48

00:02:54,667  -->  00:02:58,317
and this helps us to embed Google Maps into our website
49

49

00:02:58,317  -->  00:03:02,330
and to even create markers and control menu
50

50

00:03:02,330  -->  00:03:04,689
for locations on a map.
51

51

00:03:04,689  -->  00:03:06,640
And down here we have some examples,
52

52

00:03:06,640  -->  00:03:09,566
simple maps, and then with markers,
53

53

00:03:09,566  -->  00:03:12,805
and with even more advanced stuff.
54

54

00:03:12,805  -->  00:03:14,685
So this is pretty powerful and allows us
55

55

00:03:14,685  -->  00:03:17,298
to do all kinds of stuff with maps,
56

56

00:03:17,298  -->  00:03:19,465
and also very easy to use.
57

57

00:03:21,268  -->  00:03:22,801
Next we have this one.
58

58

00:03:22,801  -->  00:03:27,364
This is, maybe not so useful but I find it kind of cool,
59

59

00:03:27,364  -->  00:03:29,628
and it's called Typer.js,
60

60

00:03:29,628  -->  00:03:32,623
which is a jQuery plug-in that types
61

61

00:03:32,623  -->  00:03:35,444
and it looks just like this here.
62

62

00:03:35,444  -->  00:03:39,388
So it deletes the text and writes on your text,
63

63

00:03:39,388  -->  00:03:42,906
and you can use this to show multiple content
64

64

00:03:42,906  -->  00:03:44,323
in a single line,
65

65

00:03:46,460  -->  00:03:49,648
and I think it creates a cool effect.
66

66

00:03:49,648  -->  00:03:51,911
And, the last one I want to show you,
67

67

00:03:51,911  -->  00:03:54,350
is this One Page Scroll.
68

68

00:03:54,350  -->  00:03:58,912
And what this does is, it creates multiple sections
69

69

00:03:58,912  -->  00:04:01,803
where we can see always one section
70

70

00:04:01,803  -->  00:04:03,970
after the other like this.
71

71

00:04:05,077  -->  00:04:08,910
So each section fills the whole viewport hide.
72

72

00:04:10,546  -->  00:04:13,193
And you can create some beautiful stuff with this
73

73

00:04:13,193  -->  00:04:15,943
like presentation-style websites.
74

74

00:04:18,382  -->  00:04:22,318
Alright, and now before we finish this lecture,
75

75

00:04:22,318  -->  00:04:25,766
let's just include jQuery in our project
76

76

00:04:25,766  -->  00:04:28,065
and create a new JavaScript file,
77

77

00:04:28,065  -->  00:04:32,232
which is where we will create all our jQuery code.
78

78

00:04:33,847  -->  00:04:36,424
Alright, so to include jQuery,
79

79

00:04:36,424  -->  00:04:41,370
we use the Google Hosted Libraries distribution network.
80

80

00:04:41,370  -->  00:04:45,890
And so, down here, we scroll down here, alright,
81

81

00:04:45,890  -->  00:04:49,242
so down here, we just grab this script,
82

82

00:04:49,242  -->  00:04:53,898
and paste it to our website, just as we did before
83

83

00:04:53,898  -->  00:04:55,981
with those three scripts.
84

84

00:04:57,984  -->  00:05:02,151
So basically, jQuery is also a huge JavaScript file,
85

85

00:05:04,462  -->  00:05:08,363
which creates jQuery which we can then use
86

86

00:05:08,363  -->  00:05:11,428
to create some powerful stuff
87

87

00:05:11,428  -->  00:05:14,261
such as I explained to you before.
88

88

00:05:15,190  -->  00:05:18,523
And actually, we should put it not here,
89

89

00:05:20,237  -->  00:05:23,320
but before we close the body element.
90

90

00:05:25,360  -->  00:05:28,634
So this is the correct, maybe not the correct,
91

91

00:05:28,634  -->  00:05:33,510
but it's the perfect place to put the JavaScript files,
92

92

00:05:33,510  -->  00:05:35,148
so that they are only called
93

93

00:05:35,148  -->  00:05:38,565
after the rest of the web page is loaded.
94

94

00:05:39,850  -->  00:05:42,740
And now, the last thing before we finish
95

95

00:05:42,740  -->  00:05:45,657
is to create a new JavaScript file,
96

96

00:05:46,885  -->  00:05:51,052
and I'm gonna save it and I'm gonna call it Scripts.js .
97

97

00:05:56,847  -->  00:05:59,737
And since it's our file it goes into the Resources folder
98

98

00:05:59,737  -->  00:06:03,904
and then JavaScript, which is empty but not anymore.
99

99

00:06:06,529  -->  00:06:08,828
So let's now use a very basic example
100

100

00:06:08,828  -->  00:06:12,729
just to see if jQuery actually works.
101

101

00:06:12,729  -->  00:06:17,396
Okay, so every document where we write our jQuery code
102

102

00:06:17,396  -->  00:06:19,313
has to start like this.
103

103

00:06:21,088  -->  00:06:24,362
So we write document and ready,
104

104

00:06:24,362  -->  00:06:27,079
and this ensures that this code can only run
105

105

00:06:27,079  -->  00:06:30,771
after the document has been loaded.
106

106

00:06:30,771  -->  00:06:35,368
And in here, we have to write this code word function,
107

107

00:06:35,368  -->  00:06:38,201
and then open some colored braces,
108

108

00:06:39,374  -->  00:06:41,847
and then give it some space.
109

109

00:06:41,847  -->  00:06:45,504
And inside of this, we will put all our code.
110

110

00:06:45,504  -->  00:06:47,002
Now just to test this,
111

111

00:06:47,002  -->  00:06:50,485
let's pretend we want to change the background color
112

112

00:06:50,485  -->  00:06:51,985
of the H1 element.
113

113

00:06:53,828  -->  00:06:58,739
So in jQuery to select any element, you do it like this.
114

114

00:06:58,739  -->  00:07:01,700
So this is the selector and now we can do this
115

115

00:07:01,700  -->  00:07:05,450
just like in CSS, so here I'm gonna write H1,
116

116

00:07:07,412  -->  00:07:09,920
and now we use a click method.
117

117

00:07:09,920  -->  00:07:12,462
So a method is like a function,
118

118

00:07:12,462  -->  00:07:15,249
so anyone who clicks that H1 element,
119

119

00:07:15,249  -->  00:07:18,416
this is the function that will happen.
120

120

00:07:20,682  -->  00:07:24,682
So then we want this, so we select this element,
121

121

00:07:26,464  -->  00:07:30,400
and this keyword here now means our H1 element
122

122

00:07:30,400  -->  00:07:34,567
because that's what we selected in the first place.
123

123

00:07:35,450  -->  00:07:37,644
So let's use the CSS method,
124

124

00:07:37,644  -->  00:07:41,061
and in here we can change CSS properties.
125

125

00:07:42,103  -->  00:07:45,936
So we can write background color, for example,
126

126

00:07:47,223  -->  00:07:50,427
and then as the second value,
127

127

00:07:50,427  -->  00:07:52,830
and brackets actually help us here
128

128

00:07:52,830  -->  00:07:55,025
by saying we want a string here,
129

129

00:07:55,025  -->  00:07:57,108
so, we now say the color.
130

130

00:07:59,692  -->  00:08:02,443
And we want it to be red,
131

131

00:08:02,443  -->  00:08:06,100
and this is the RGB code for red, if you remember.
132

132

00:08:06,100  -->  00:08:09,827
So a string is like a couple of characters grouped together,
133

133

00:08:09,827  -->  00:08:12,994
such as this background color or this.
134

134

00:08:14,494  -->  00:08:18,326
Okay, now before we can test this code,
135

135

00:08:18,326  -->  00:08:23,306
we need of course to incorporate this JavaScript file
136

136

00:08:23,306  -->  00:08:25,223
in the index HTML file.
137

137

00:08:27,242  -->  00:08:29,994
So down here, where we called
138

138

00:08:29,994  -->  00:08:32,954
the other JavaScript files, right?
139

139

00:08:32,954  -->  00:08:37,099
So now we add a new script here, and in this case,
140

140

00:08:37,099  -->  00:08:41,209
it is on our computer and it is the one we just created.
141

141

00:08:41,209  -->  00:08:45,209
So it's in the Resources folder and descript JS.
142

142

00:08:47,200  -->  00:08:50,533
And I close it and now this should work.
143

143

00:08:52,459  -->  00:08:56,395
And now, we can click this and the background turns red,
144

144

00:08:56,395  -->  00:08:59,312
such as we said in our jQuery code.
145

145

00:09:00,574  -->  00:09:02,420
So let's quickly review this,
146

146

00:09:02,420  -->  00:09:04,670
so we select the H1 element
147

147

00:09:06,461  -->  00:09:09,108
and then we use the click method,
148

148

00:09:09,108  -->  00:09:13,531
so when we click on the H1 element and select this,
149

149

00:09:13,531  -->  00:09:16,805
so the H1 element we selected in the first place,
150

150

00:09:16,805  -->  00:09:21,472
and then it changes the CSS style of that element.
151

151

00:09:21,472  -->  00:09:24,154
And, in this case, we add a background color
152

152

00:09:24,154  -->  00:09:28,321
and make it red, and that's exactly what happened.
153

153

00:09:29,483  -->  00:09:31,782
Alright, so we don't need this anymore actually,
154

154

00:09:31,782  -->  00:09:34,534
this was just to show you that everything works.
155

155

00:09:34,534  -->  00:09:36,484
And now, in the next couple of lectures,
156

156

00:09:36,484  -->  00:09:39,584
we're gonna add some real-world jQuery code
157

157

00:09:39,584  -->  00:09:42,251
to make our website even better.
158

158

00:09:43,415  -->  00:09:46,082
So, see you in the next lecture!
