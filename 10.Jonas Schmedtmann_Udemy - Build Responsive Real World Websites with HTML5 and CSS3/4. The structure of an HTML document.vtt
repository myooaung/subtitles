00:00:02.309  -->  00:00:04.823
<v Voiceover>In this video, we'll create a new project</v>
2

2

00:00:04.823  -->  00:00:06.610
in Brackets and talk about
3

3

00:00:06.610  -->  00:00:10.110
the common structure of any HTML document.
4

4

00:00:12.379  -->  00:00:14.982
Let's start by creating an empty folder
5

5

00:00:14.982  -->  00:00:18.149
where we will put our first HTML file.
6

6

00:00:19.195  -->  00:00:23.520
I'll create this folder right here on my desktop.
7

7

00:00:23.520  -->  00:00:27.745
But you can create your working folder wherever you like.
8

8

00:00:27.745  -->  00:00:29.463
We'll call this one "blog post,"
9

9

00:00:29.463  -->  00:00:32.987
because as I showed you before, we will start
10

10

00:00:32.987  -->  00:00:36.320
by building a simple blog post web page.
11

11

00:00:37.980  -->  00:00:40.418
I'll leave it empty and just leave it here.
12

12

00:00:40.418  -->  00:00:44.585
And now let's finally open up Brackets, just our coding.
13

13

00:00:50.546  -->  00:00:53.193
Now by clicking on this button here,
14

14

00:00:53.193  -->  00:00:56.690
we can open the folder we just created.
15

15

00:00:56.690  -->  00:01:00.777
So it's this blog post folder right here.
16

16

00:01:00.777  -->  00:01:04.376
Brackets now uses this folder as our project folder.
17

17

00:01:04.376  -->  00:01:07.092
So all files contained in this folder
18

18

00:01:07.092  -->  00:01:09.425
will be part of our project.
19

19

00:01:10.436  -->  00:01:13.083
Now we are able to create an empty file.
20

20

00:01:13.083  -->  00:01:17.250
And for that, just hit the File menu and then New.
21

21

00:01:18.210  -->  00:01:20.206
And that's it.
22

22

00:01:20.206  -->  00:01:21.206
Very simple.
23

23

00:01:22.064  -->  00:01:25.036
Now let's save it, and give it a name.
24

24

00:01:25.036  -->  00:01:27.757
File, Save.
25

25

00:01:27.757  -->  00:01:30.924
And we're going to call it index.html.
26

26

00:01:32.644  -->  00:01:36.811
So that the computer recognizes it as an HTML document.
27

27

00:01:37.998  -->  00:01:40.576
Index.html is a standard name for
28

28

00:01:40.576  -->  00:01:43.409
the main HTML file of any project.
29

29

00:01:46.056  -->  00:01:49.028
So as I mentioned before, HTML documents
30

30

00:01:49.028  -->  00:01:51.652
are described by elements.
31

31

00:01:51.652  -->  00:01:55.297
Now all HTML documents have a common structure
32

32

00:01:55.297  -->  00:01:59.454
where the HTML element is the first one, always.
33

33

00:01:59.454  -->  00:02:04.317
So we'll start with this one, HTML, and close it.
34

34

00:02:04.317  -->  00:02:07.591
And now, you see Brackets helps us here
35

35

00:02:07.591  -->  00:02:11.214
and closes the tag automatically for us.
36

36

00:02:11.214  -->  00:02:12.381
Pretty useful.
37

37

00:02:16.043  -->  00:02:18.273
Now inside the HTML element,
38

38

00:02:18.273  -->  00:02:22.081
there are always two key elements in every structure.
39

39

00:02:22.081  -->  00:02:24.440
It's the head and the body.
40

40

00:02:24.440  -->  00:02:28.109
These are the main components of any web page.
41

41

00:02:28.109  -->  00:02:31.859
So let's just put them into the HTML element.
42

42

00:02:32.822  -->  00:02:37.723
So head, and Brackets also helps us with this.
43

43

00:02:37.723  -->  00:02:41.763
It automatically recognized what we want to write.
44

44

00:02:41.763  -->  00:02:45.930
So now I just hit Return and close the tag.
45

45

00:02:46.825  -->  00:02:50.658
And like magic, the other closing tag appears.
46

46

00:02:51.682  -->  00:02:55.682
So the head and the same thing for the body tag.
47

47

00:02:58.358  -->  00:02:59.191
And save it.
48

48

00:02:59.191  -->  00:03:01.632
You can also hit Command S or Control S
49

49

00:03:01.632  -->  00:03:03.382
in a Windows machine.
50

50

00:03:05.138  -->  00:03:08.923
The head element can include a title for your web site.
51

51

00:03:08.923  -->  00:03:12.034
CSS styles, some information for the browser
52

52

00:03:12.034  -->  00:03:15.066
or for search engines and more.
53

53

00:03:15.066  -->  00:03:18.062
We'll work on all of that later.
54

54

00:03:18.062  -->  00:03:20.829
The body element is where all the visible stuff
55

55

00:03:20.829  -->  00:03:23.407
of your web page goes, like all the content
56

56

00:03:23.407  -->  00:03:27.574
such as text, links, images, lists, and many more elements.
57

57

00:03:29.458  -->  00:03:33.419
So just a very basic structure of an HTML document,
58

58

00:03:33.419  -->  00:03:36.159
but actually, there is one thing missing here,
59

59

00:03:36.159  -->  00:03:39.142
and that's the so-called doctype.
60

60

00:03:39.142  -->  00:03:42.332
The doctype declaration must be the very first thing
61

61

00:03:42.332  -->  00:03:47.092
in your HTML document, even before the HTML tag.
62

62

00:03:47.092  -->  00:03:49.259
So let's just put it here.
63

63

00:03:51.666  -->  00:03:53.082
It goes like this.
64

64

00:03:53.082  -->  00:03:54.249
Doctype...
65

65

00:03:58.444  -->  00:03:59.958
Sorry.
66

66

00:03:59.958  -->  00:04:03.625
Doctype then HTML.
67

67

00:04:05.368  -->  00:04:08.805
This is technically not an HTML element,
68

68

00:04:08.805  -->  00:04:11.545
but an instruction to the browser about what version
69

69

00:04:11.545  -->  00:04:14.703
of HTML the page is written in.
70

70

00:04:14.703  -->  00:04:17.489
So with this declaration, I just told the browser
71

71

00:04:17.489  -->  00:04:20.156
that this file will be an HTML5.
72

72

00:04:22.226  -->  00:04:25.040
And save our document again.
73

73

00:04:25.040  -->  00:04:27.004
And speaking of saving,
74

74

00:04:27.004  -->  00:04:31.004
let's install our very first Brackets extension.
75

75

00:04:32.879  -->  00:04:37.046
I will just hit this button here like I showed you before.
76

76

00:04:38.010  -->  00:04:40.512
And here clicking on the Available tag
77

77

00:04:40.512  -->  00:04:43.280
and we'll write "Autosave."
78

78

00:04:43.280  -->  00:04:46.780
This little extension takes care of saving
79

79

00:04:48.360  -->  00:04:50.519
all our files whenever we leave
80

80

00:04:50.519  -->  00:04:53.686
the Brackets up, which is very useful.
81

81

00:04:55.024  -->  00:04:56.974
So I already have it installed
82

82

00:04:56.974  -->  00:05:01.141
but you can just click here on this install button.
83

83

00:05:07.948  -->  00:05:08.781
Now we know how to create
84

84

00:05:08.781  -->  00:05:12.373
the basic structure of an HTML element.
85

85

00:05:12.373  -->  00:05:14.830
In the next video, we finally start to code
86

86

00:05:14.830  -->  00:05:18.330
some visible stuff for our first web page.
