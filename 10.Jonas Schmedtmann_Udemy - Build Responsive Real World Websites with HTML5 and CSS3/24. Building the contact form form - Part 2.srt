00:00:02,080  -->  00:00:06,247
<v Voiceover>So, let's use CSS to style our contact form.</v>
2

2

00:00:08,232  -->  00:00:10,965
So, back here, I notice two things.
3

3

00:00:10,965  -->  00:00:14,108
First, that these elements here don't
4

4

00:00:14,108  -->  00:00:16,775
fill, 100% of their column.
5

5

00:00:17,856  -->  00:00:19,915
And, the other thing, is that we
6

6

00:00:19,915  -->  00:00:23,460
clearly don't need all the entire width
7

7

00:00:23,460  -->  00:00:26,668
of the parent element of this row here.
8

8

00:00:26,668  -->  00:00:28,687
'Cause there is way too much space
9

9

00:00:28,687  -->  00:00:32,331
here between the labels and the elements.
10

10

00:00:32,331  -->  00:00:36,248
And this doesn't look good. So, let's fix that.
11

11

00:00:37,797  -->  00:00:41,047
So, back in our HTML file, this will be
12

12

00:00:42,116  -->  00:00:45,033
the form and the class that we want
13

13

00:00:45,917  -->  00:00:48,250
to format, the contact form.
14

14

00:00:50,323  -->  00:00:54,466
So, add a new class, and some white space.
15

15

00:00:54,466  -->  00:00:55,799
That's all this.
16

16

00:00:56,835  -->  00:00:58,502
Delete this as well.
17

17

00:01:04,485  -->  00:01:08,652
Alright, so let's say we want a width of only 60%.
18

18

00:01:12,264  -->  00:01:14,440
This should be much better.
19

19

00:01:14,440  -->  00:01:18,469
And then we also want to center that thing,
20

20

00:01:18,469  -->  00:01:20,457
and we could use that technique where
21

21

00:01:20,457  -->  00:01:24,469
we say that we want the left margin to be 20%,
22

22

00:01:24,469  -->  00:01:28,834
which is half of the difference between 100 and 60.
23

23

00:01:28,834  -->  00:01:33,480
But in the case, I want to format it the other way,
24

24

00:01:33,480  -->  00:01:34,811
that I showed you before.
25

25

00:01:34,811  -->  00:01:36,235
Which is saying that the margin
26

26

00:01:36,235  -->  00:01:39,129
top and bottom should be zero.
27

27

00:01:39,129  -->  00:01:41,962
And auto on left and right margin.
28

28

00:01:42,814  -->  00:01:45,430
So, this will center this contact form
29

29

00:01:45,430  -->  00:01:47,847
inside of its parent element.
30

30

00:01:48,875  -->  00:01:52,615
And now I want to format my other form elements.
31

31

00:01:52,615  -->  00:01:55,198
So, input and the other one was
32

32

00:01:56,431  -->  00:01:59,598
the select element, and the text area.
33

33

00:02:02,849  -->  00:02:06,016
And the first thing, I want them to be
34

34

00:02:07,770  -->  00:02:11,937
100% wide, so that they fill their whole column.
35

35

00:02:14,960  -->  00:02:17,548
And I also want them a little bit bigger,
36

36

00:02:17,548  -->  00:02:21,269
by adding some padding inside of them.
37

37

00:02:21,269  -->  00:02:25,436
Let's say seven pixels, that is a number that I like to use.
38

38

00:02:26,382  -->  00:02:28,965
And also a little border radius
39

39

00:02:31,026  -->  00:02:33,276
of let's say, three pixels.
40

40

00:02:35,517  -->  00:02:38,184
Alright, let's see, what we got.
41

41

00:02:39,809  -->  00:02:43,392
Okay, now we have some strange border here.
42

42

00:02:45,470  -->  00:02:49,161
And we also have another thing, that we don't want,
43

43

00:02:49,161  -->  00:02:52,661
which is this input element, and this one,
44

44

00:02:53,761  -->  00:02:55,935
also fill the whole content.
45

45

00:02:55,935  -->  00:02:59,687
But, in fact, we only want these two.
46

46

00:02:59,687  -->  00:03:02,761
So, how do we achieve that?
47

47

00:03:02,761  -->  00:03:06,261
Let me go back, and let me show it to you.
48

48

00:03:07,585  -->  00:03:11,752
So, the one step we want are the ones with type text,
49

49

00:03:12,842  -->  00:03:14,675
and type email, right?
50

50

00:03:16,147  -->  00:03:19,502
So I will show a new selector in CSS now,
51

51

00:03:19,502  -->  00:03:21,199
which does the following.
52

52

00:03:21,199  -->  00:03:25,434
With them, we can select all input elements,
53

53

00:03:25,434  -->  00:03:27,434
which has the type text.
54

54

00:03:29,095  -->  00:03:31,845
So we say type should equal text.
55

55

00:03:33,003  -->  00:03:36,836
And then we can say the same thing with email.
56

56

00:03:43,254  -->  00:03:45,171
And, alright. It works.
57

57

00:03:46,278  -->  00:03:48,681
So the bottom is back to normal
58

58

00:03:48,681  -->  00:03:51,181
and this check button as well.
59

59

00:03:52,607  -->  00:03:57,109
And now we gotta get rid of this weird border here.
60

60

00:03:57,109  -->  00:03:59,080
And that should be quite easy,
61

61

00:03:59,080  -->  00:04:02,163
just say border one pixel, as always,
62

62

00:04:03,605  -->  00:04:06,188
and solid, and some grey color.
63

63

00:04:08,011  -->  00:04:11,428
So, the color picker here, and let's say,
64

64

00:04:13,674  -->  00:04:15,533
it shouldn't be too dark.
65

65

00:04:15,533  -->  00:04:18,335
As always, we want something very subtle here.
66

66

00:04:18,335  -->  00:04:21,593
I think this one is good. CCC.
67

67

00:04:21,593  -->  00:04:25,926
That's also a grey color that I like to use a lot.
68

68

00:04:25,926  -->  00:04:28,593
Alright, let's see. Okay, great.
69

69

00:04:31,220  -->  00:04:35,061
You see that this select element here,
70

70

00:04:35,061  -->  00:04:38,811
doesn't have the width of these two elements.
71

71

00:04:41,378  -->  00:04:43,862
And, in fact, it's very difficult to
72

72

00:04:43,862  -->  00:04:46,706
style these select elements,
73

73

00:04:46,706  -->  00:04:49,706
and so we'll leave it just as it is.
74

74

00:04:51,924  -->  00:04:55,025
Now we want this text area to be a little bigger,
75

75

00:04:55,025  -->  00:04:57,687
and we want this send button here to
76

76

00:04:57,687  -->  00:05:00,020
look like the other buttons.
77

77

00:05:02,535  -->  00:05:05,982
I mean, like this button, like the full button.
78

78

00:05:05,982  -->  00:05:07,482
So, let's go back.
79

79

00:05:08,425  -->  00:05:10,675
So, I'll just say text area
80

80

00:05:11,945  -->  00:05:14,362
and the height of 100 pixels.
81

81

00:05:16,927  -->  00:05:21,094
And now for the button, we do a very simple thing now,
82

82

00:05:23,980  -->  00:05:28,147
so we go back to the original buttons that we defined.
83

83

00:05:30,047  -->  00:05:32,350
Oh, here they are.
84

84

00:05:32,350  -->  00:05:35,039
And since we want them to look
85

85

00:05:35,039  -->  00:05:37,176
exactly the same as these buttons,
86

86

00:05:37,176  -->  00:05:38,425
we can just add a line here,
87

87

00:05:38,425  -->  00:05:42,008
and then, they will be styled the same way.
88

88

00:05:42,978  -->  00:05:45,848
And that button down there,
89

89

00:05:45,848  -->  00:05:48,931
is an input, with type submit, right?
90

90

00:05:51,315  -->  00:05:53,057
Do you remember?
91

91

00:05:53,057  -->  00:05:56,047
So we just have to do this,
92

92

00:05:56,047  -->  00:06:00,214
now let's copy this, because we also want to have it here.
93

93

00:06:01,663  -->  00:06:05,830
So now it will look exactly like this full button.
94

94

00:06:07,232  -->  00:06:11,399
Though here, of course, it is an equal, not an underscore.
95

95

00:06:13,250  -->  00:06:17,417
And then we also, of course, want this hover effect here.
96

96

00:06:19,644  -->  00:06:22,357
So let's place it here as well,
97

97

00:06:22,357  -->  00:06:24,107
change that to equal,
98

98

00:06:25,059  -->  00:06:27,304
and let's check this now.
99

99

00:06:27,304  -->  00:06:29,387
Alright, this looks good.
100

100

00:06:30,533  -->  00:06:34,307
And now we have to make this hover effect here work as well.
101

101

00:06:34,307  -->  00:06:36,865
And that should be easy enough,
102

102

00:06:36,865  -->  00:06:40,032
and back here, we just put, this code.
103

103

00:06:46,259  -->  00:06:47,926
This one, of course.
104

104

00:06:49,334  -->  00:06:53,501
Put it here and say hover, and the same thing with active.
105

105

00:06:59,661  -->  00:07:01,911
And that should do the job.
106

106

00:07:04,198  -->  00:07:05,031
Alright.
107

107

00:07:08,866  -->  00:07:09,866
Okay, great.
108

108

00:07:13,420  -->  00:07:17,652
So this looks, already, pretty formatted, right?
109

109

00:07:17,652  -->  00:07:19,787
Maybe one thing that we can do here
110

110

00:07:19,787  -->  00:07:22,200
to make this look even better is to
111

111

00:07:22,200  -->  00:07:24,651
add some space around this checkbox here
112

112

00:07:24,651  -->  00:07:28,818
because I think this looks a little wide space here.
113

113

00:07:30,887  -->  00:07:34,406
You can actually see this here with those labels.
114

114

00:07:34,406  -->  00:07:36,906
They look a little weird here.
115

115

00:07:38,556  -->  00:07:39,666
So, I'm going to do that.
116

116

00:07:39,666  -->  00:07:41,201
And the other thing is that I want to
117

117

00:07:41,201  -->  00:07:45,368
get rid of these blue borders that will chromats to this.
118

118

00:07:47,413  -->  00:07:50,246
So, let's do these two things now.
119

119

00:07:53,637  -->  00:07:55,637
First, I add a checkbox,
120

120

00:07:56,646  -->  00:07:57,895
and that's pretty easy.
121

121

00:07:57,895  -->  00:08:02,062
Just say input and then, of course, type equals checkbox.
122

122

00:08:08,995  -->  00:08:13,084
And I want some margin on maybe all sides,
123

123

00:08:13,084  -->  00:08:15,608
so we didn't do this for a long time.
124

124

00:08:15,608  -->  00:08:19,612
So, at the top I want, let's say 10 pixels,
125

125

00:08:19,612  -->  00:08:22,549
at right side, I want some five pixels,
126

126

00:08:22,549  -->  00:08:26,139
so between the checkbox and the text.
127

127

00:08:26,139  -->  00:08:29,229
At the bottom, also 10 pixels,
128

128

00:08:29,229  -->  00:08:32,939
and on the left side, no margin at all.
129

129

00:08:32,939  -->  00:08:36,057
And the last thing is to get rid of those borders,
130

130

00:08:36,057  -->  00:08:38,724
when we focus on those elements.
131

131

00:08:40,482  -->  00:08:42,566
And the best thing of doing that is to
132

132

00:08:42,566  -->  00:08:45,711
get rid of it for all elements.
133

133

00:08:45,711  -->  00:08:49,878
So we have a lot of zero class here, which is called focus.
134

134

00:08:50,865  -->  00:08:55,032
And we just say, outline none, and then it should go away.
135

135

00:08:56,459  -->  00:08:58,042
So, check this out.
136

136

00:08:59,808  -->  00:09:02,326
Alright, no focus here anymore,
137

137

00:09:02,326  -->  00:09:04,477
and we have some distance here,
138

138

00:09:04,477  -->  00:09:09,092
between those elements, which looks much better now.
139

139

00:09:09,092  -->  00:09:09,925
So, yeah.
140

140

00:09:11,009  -->  00:09:14,560
Now there's only the footer left to do,
141

141

00:09:14,560  -->  00:09:17,296
and we'll do that right in the next lecture.
142

142

00:09:17,296  -->  00:09:18,796
So, see you there.
