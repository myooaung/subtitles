<v Voiceover>In this lecture, we will talk about</v>
2

2

00:00:03,230  -->  00:00:06,945
how you should use icons in web design.
3

3

00:00:06,945  -->  00:00:11,822
Icons can be a very important part of a web designer's work.
4

4

00:00:11,822  -->  00:00:14,701
Icons improve the aesthetic of a web site
5

5

00:00:14,701  -->  00:00:19,368
and can provide a better user experience, if well used.
6

6

00:00:19,368  -->  00:00:23,246
It is actually pretty incredible how much power icons have
7

7

00:00:23,246  -->  00:00:27,820
in determining the look and feel of an entire web site.
8

8

00:00:27,820  -->  00:00:32,673
But icons can also cause user confusion when poorly used.
9

9

00:00:32,673  -->  00:00:33,506
This is why where are
10

10

00:00:33,506  -->  00:00:35,622
some very simple, basic guidelines
11

11

00:00:35,622  -->  00:00:37,122
you should follow.
12

12

00:00:37,967  -->  00:00:42,356
First, you can use icons to show features of your web site
13

13

00:00:42,356  -->  00:00:44,933
or a product that you're selling, or steps
14

14

00:00:44,933  -->  00:00:48,950
that a user should follow to achieve some goal.
15

15

00:00:48,950  -->  00:00:51,830
This is a powerful, modern, and beautiful way
16

16

00:00:51,830  -->  00:00:55,150
of showing what your site has to offer.
17

17

00:00:55,150  -->  00:00:58,401
Icons actually help the user to quickly browse through
18

18

00:00:58,401  -->  00:01:02,766
a page and get an idea what the web site is all about.
19

19

00:01:02,766  -->  00:01:05,390
So I strongly recommend you to use icons
20

20

00:01:05,390  -->  00:01:08,307
in your design in these situations.
21

21

00:01:09,941  -->  00:01:13,262
And here you have some inspiration for how to use icons
22

22

00:01:13,262  -->  00:01:16,303
to show features of a web site.
23

23

00:01:16,303  -->  00:01:18,370
The possibilities are endless,
24

24

00:01:18,370  -->  00:01:21,620
as you can see from all these examples.
25

25

00:01:22,898  -->  00:01:24,732
Or instead of showing features,
26

26

00:01:24,732  -->  00:01:28,424
you can use icons for actions and links.
27

27

00:01:28,424  -->  00:01:33,254
Popular web sites like Facebook or YouTube do exactly this,
28

28

00:01:33,254  -->  00:01:36,458
and I'm sure you see this all the time.
29

29

00:01:36,458  -->  00:01:39,709
In the case you use icons for doing this,
30

30

00:01:39,709  -->  00:01:42,943
there are two rules to follow:
31

31

00:01:42,943  -->  00:01:47,216
First, your icons should be instantaneously recognizable
32

32

00:01:47,216  -->  00:01:50,187
and remove open interpretation.
33

33

00:01:50,187  -->  00:01:53,949
And secondly, label your icons if you have enough space
34

34

00:01:53,949  -->  00:01:58,116
to do so, because otherwise, you may confuse your users.
35

35

00:01:59,638  -->  00:02:02,656
And whatever you do with icons, they should not take
36

36

00:02:02,656  -->  00:02:05,095
a center stage in your design.
37

37

00:02:05,095  -->  00:02:07,927
Instead, they should play a supporting role.
38

38

00:02:07,927  -->  00:02:10,992
For example, take this beautiful web site.
39

39

00:02:10,992  -->  00:02:11,825
I know it's very small,
40

40

00:02:11,825  -->  00:02:14,429
and you can't read the text actually,
41

41

00:02:14,429  -->  00:02:16,527
but what matters here is that
42

42

00:02:16,527  -->  00:02:19,987
it's not covered with icons everywhere.
43

43

00:02:19,987  -->  00:02:22,169
There are just these three icons
44

44

00:02:22,169  -->  00:02:24,236
that have a supporting role.
45

45

00:02:24,236  -->  00:02:28,403
In this case, to list the features of the product.
46

46

00:02:29,971  -->  00:02:33,245
Now, there are two types of icon formats:
47

47

00:02:33,245  -->  00:02:36,495
Icons in form of images and icon fonts.
48

48

00:02:37,415  -->  00:02:40,132
Icon fonts use smooth, vector images instead
49

49

00:02:40,132  -->  00:02:44,916
of common roster images to display icons on your web site.
50

50

00:02:44,916  -->  00:02:47,586
I strongly recommend you to use icon fonts
51

51

00:02:47,586  -->  00:02:51,022
for web design whenever possible.
52

52

00:02:51,022  -->  00:02:53,414
And that's because vectors scale endlessly
53

53

00:02:53,414  -->  00:02:56,525
up or down for any resolution.
54

54

00:02:56,525  -->  00:02:58,244
This is especially important
55

55

00:02:58,244  -->  00:03:00,775
for today's high-resolution displays found
56

56

00:03:00,775  -->  00:03:03,306
in most smartphones and some computers
57

57

00:03:03,306  -->  00:03:05,306
such as the Retina Macs.
58

58

00:03:07,669  -->  00:03:08,837
And don't worry.
59

59

00:03:08,837  -->  00:03:12,714
You don't have to design any icons by yourself, of course.
60

60

00:03:12,714  -->  00:03:16,801
As with images, there are tons of online resources
61

61

00:03:16,801  -->  00:03:19,587
where you can get free icon sets.
62

62

00:03:19,587  -->  00:03:21,770
And as before, I share some of them
63

63

00:03:21,770  -->  00:03:24,187
in the course ebook with you.
