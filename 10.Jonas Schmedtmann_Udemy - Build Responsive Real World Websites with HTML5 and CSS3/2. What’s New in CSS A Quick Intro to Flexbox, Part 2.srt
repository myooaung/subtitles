00:00:01,130  -->  00:00:02,824
<v Jonas>Welcome back to the second part</v>
2

2

00:00:02,824  -->  00:00:07,200
of this quick crash course to Flexbox.
3

3

00:00:07,200  -->  00:00:09,380
So this is where we left off in the last video,
4

4

00:00:09,380  -->  00:00:13,646
and we already have the hero part and the price part ready
5

5

00:00:13,646  -->  00:00:16,420
so now we're gonna worry about the content.
6

6

00:00:16,420  -->  00:00:17,850
And just as a reminder,
7

7

00:00:17,850  -->  00:00:20,790
this is what it's gonna look like in the end.
8

8

00:00:20,790  -->  00:00:22,200
Okay, so this is a reference.
9

9

00:00:22,200  -->  00:00:26,750
And let's now recreate this using the power of Flexbox.
10

10

00:00:26,750  -->  00:00:29,010
Giving us some more space here.
11

11

00:00:29,010  -->  00:00:32,563
And I will start with the markup for the first part.
12

12

00:00:33,850  -->  00:00:35,270
So in the content,
13

13

00:00:35,270  -->  00:00:38,043
I'm gonna create a pizza title element.
14

14

00:00:51,380  -->  00:00:52,213
And in there,
15

15

00:00:52,213  -->  00:00:53,810
we will have the title
16

16

00:00:53,810  -->  00:00:56,880
and the two tags that I showed you before.
17

17

00:00:56,880  -->  00:01:00,260
So let's actually take a look at that again.
18

18

00:01:00,260  -->  00:01:02,064
So this entire element here,
19

19

00:01:02,064  -->  00:01:04,681
this will be the pizza title.
20

20

00:01:04,681  -->  00:01:07,260
And so this will be the heading.
21

21

00:01:07,260  -->  00:01:08,540
This part will be the heading.
22

22

00:01:08,540  -->  00:01:10,343
And then these two tags here.
23

23

00:01:12,380  -->  00:01:14,253
Okay, so we have an h1.
24

24

00:01:23,407  -->  00:01:26,574
And this one is called pizza vegetale.
25

25

00:01:28,750  -->  00:01:31,190
And let me add a small emoji here.
26

26

00:01:31,190  -->  00:01:32,050
And if you're on a Mac,
27

27

00:01:32,050  -->  00:01:33,800
to get this emoji window here,
28

28

00:01:33,800  -->  00:01:36,444
you just have to type control+command+space
29

29

00:01:36,444  -->  00:01:38,670
and then...
30

30

00:01:38,670  -->  00:01:39,743
Where is that?
31

31

00:01:41,690  -->  00:01:43,440
So that's the one I'm looking for.
32

32

00:01:43,440  -->  00:01:44,273
On Windows,
33

33

00:01:44,273  -->  00:01:46,650
I'm not really sure how to do it.
34

34

00:01:46,650  -->  00:01:47,990
Actually, if you don't like these emojis,
35

35

00:01:47,990  -->  00:01:50,140
you can just skip them altogether.
36

36

00:01:50,140  -->  00:01:52,650
Okay, I find them fun here in this user interface.
37

37

00:01:52,650  -->  00:01:53,959
Instead of using real icons,
38

38

00:01:53,959  -->  00:01:57,093
I just use these ones.
39

39

00:01:58,210  -->  00:01:59,420
So that is the h1
40

40

00:01:59,420  -->  00:02:02,853
and let's get these tags.
41

41

00:02:07,510  -->  00:02:08,730
So pizza tag.
42

42

00:02:08,730  -->  00:02:09,563
And if you remember,
43

43

00:02:09,563  -->  00:02:11,980
there were two of them and they had different colors.
44

44

00:02:11,980  -->  00:02:14,460
So now I'm gonna use that modifier
45

45

00:02:14,460  -->  00:02:16,270
as I was telling you before.
46

46

00:02:16,270  -->  00:02:18,970
So we have pizza tag to style both of them.
47

47

00:02:18,970  -->  00:02:21,120
And then I'm gonna add a more specific class
48

48

00:02:21,120  -->  00:02:22,380
to each of them.
49

49

00:02:22,380  -->  00:02:27,337
So this is gonna be the pizza tag and then dash dash one.
50

50

00:02:28,815  -->  00:02:29,648
And then the other one,
51

51

00:02:29,648  -->  00:02:30,481
as you can guess,
52

52

00:02:30,481  -->  00:02:31,314
will be the number two.
53

53

00:02:37,490  -->  00:02:39,440
So you wanna say that it's a vegetarian
54

54

00:02:42,290  -->  00:02:44,623
and also that it's Italian.
55

55

00:02:46,460  -->  00:02:49,420
Okay, so that's it for the title.
56

56

00:02:49,420  -->  00:02:52,363
So let's go ahead and actually style them.
57

57

00:03:00,570  -->  00:03:01,900
So pizza heading.
58

58

00:03:01,900  -->  00:03:05,670
And actually, I'm missing the pizza title.
59

59

00:03:05,670  -->  00:03:07,423
Let's go ahead and copy this.
60

60

00:03:10,310  -->  00:03:14,583
Title and the tag.
61

61

00:03:18,980  -->  00:03:20,363
And also tag one and two.
62

62

00:03:24,550  -->  00:03:26,950
And these will only have one line of code, so...
63

63

00:03:31,490  -->  00:03:34,620
Alright, first of all,
64

64

00:03:34,620  -->  00:03:37,910
we wanna have these three elements here side by side.
65

65

00:03:37,910  -->  00:03:40,810
Okay, so by now, you already know how to do that.
66

66

00:03:40,810  -->  00:03:41,951
So all we have to do
67

67

00:03:41,951  -->  00:03:44,850
is decide what the flex container will be
68

68

00:03:44,850  -->  00:03:47,380
and that is, of course, the pizza title.
69

69

00:03:47,380  -->  00:03:50,620
Alright, so that is the element that contains these three.
70

70

00:03:50,620  -->  00:03:54,320
So pizza title will be display flex.
71

71

00:03:57,120  -->  00:03:58,170
And just like this,
72

72

00:03:58,170  -->  00:03:59,870
they should be now side by side.
73

73

00:03:59,870  -->  00:04:01,950
They don't really fit because this text is super large.
74

74

00:04:01,950  -->  00:04:03,910
So let me actually go ahead
75

75

00:04:03,910  -->  00:04:06,130
and decrease that in the heading.
76

76

00:04:06,130  -->  00:04:09,510
So font size, 20 pixels.
77

77

00:04:12,474  -->  00:04:16,250
And now, as for these tags,
78

78

00:04:16,250  -->  00:04:17,820
let's also just style them.
79

79

00:04:17,820  -->  00:04:20,529
And we're gonna take care of the alignment
80

80

00:04:20,529  -->  00:04:22,263
and all that stuff a bit later.
81

81

00:04:24,350  -->  00:04:25,183
So for these,
82

82

00:04:25,183  -->  00:04:28,320
we want a font size of 10 pixels.
83

83

00:04:28,320  -->  00:04:30,180
So kinda small.
84

84

00:04:30,180  -->  00:04:31,663
We want them to be uppercase.
85

85

00:04:35,910  -->  00:04:37,173
So uppercase.
86

86

00:04:38,650  -->  00:04:39,740
Their color should be white
87

87

00:04:39,740  -->  00:04:42,340
because each of them should have a background color.
88

88

00:04:44,370  -->  00:04:45,203
And so for now,
89

89

00:04:45,203  -->  00:04:46,210
they will kind of disappear.
90

90

00:04:46,210  -->  00:04:47,043
So let's go ahead
91

91

00:04:47,043  -->  00:04:48,810
and actually give each of them a background color.
92

92

00:04:48,810  -->  00:04:49,879
The first one is green.
93

93

00:04:49,879  -->  00:04:51,029
The second one is blue.
94

94

00:04:55,510  -->  00:04:56,343
Where are we?
95

95

00:04:59,850  -->  00:05:01,330
Background color is this one
96

96

00:05:01,330  -->  00:05:04,027
and here we have the blue one.
97

97

00:05:15,430  -->  00:05:16,263
Alright.
98

98

00:05:18,420  -->  00:05:20,500
Let's just give them some padding.
99

99

00:05:20,500  -->  00:05:22,533
Two pixels on top, seven on the sides.
100

100

00:05:26,710  -->  00:05:28,300
And some border radius.
101

101

00:05:28,300  -->  00:05:29,350
Something really large.
102

102

00:05:29,350  -->  00:05:30,183
It doesn't really matter.
103

103

00:05:30,183  -->  00:05:32,433
All we want is this exact look here.
104

104

00:05:34,640  -->  00:05:36,990
And now finally some spacing between them.
105

105

00:05:36,990  -->  00:05:41,263
So I'm gonna give them both margin left of seven pixels.
106

106

00:05:42,620  -->  00:05:44,460
Alright, so that looks great already.
107

107

00:05:44,460  -->  00:05:47,827
So now what we want is these two on the right side
108

108

00:05:47,827  -->  00:05:51,000
and, of course, they shouldn't stretch like this.
109

109

00:05:51,000  -->  00:05:52,840
And that's the easiest part, right?
110

110

00:05:52,840  -->  00:05:55,380
Because remember that the default value
111

111

00:05:55,380  -->  00:05:58,500
of the align items property is stretch.
112

112

00:05:58,500  -->  00:06:00,940
And that's why along the cross axis
113

113

00:06:00,940  -->  00:06:02,700
they're now stretched like this.
114

114

00:06:02,700  -->  00:06:05,390
So we need to go to the flex container
115

115

00:06:05,390  -->  00:06:07,203
and say, align items,
116

116

00:06:08,350  -->  00:06:10,650
and in this case we want them centered.
117

117

00:06:10,650  -->  00:06:12,750
So watch what happens.
118

118

00:06:12,750  -->  00:06:15,830
Yeah, now they're really nicely vertically aligned
119

119

00:06:15,830  -->  00:06:17,550
with this title here.
120

120

00:06:17,550  -->  00:06:18,610
So without Flexbox,
121

121

00:06:18,610  -->  00:06:21,300
you would now have to go ahead
122

122

00:06:21,300  -->  00:06:23,220
and add some margin to the top
123

123

00:06:23,220  -->  00:06:25,520
and really guess how you'd want this to look.
124

124

00:06:25,520  -->  00:06:26,590
But like this, it's so much easier.
125

125

00:06:26,590  -->  00:06:27,670
We don't have to guess anything
126

126

00:06:27,670  -->  00:06:29,810
in order to make them vertically aligned.
127

127

00:06:29,810  -->  00:06:32,702
All we have to do is write one line of code
128

128

00:06:32,702  -->  00:06:33,750
and that's it.
129

129

00:06:33,750  -->  00:06:35,350
Really straightforward
130

130

00:06:35,350  -->  00:06:37,483
with really just a small amount of code.
131

131

00:06:38,440  -->  00:06:39,273
And before we move on,
132

132

00:06:39,273  -->  00:06:42,160
let's give this entire container here some padding.
133

133

00:06:42,160  -->  00:06:44,863
So, its the pizza content.
134

134

00:06:48,690  -->  00:06:50,270
So 35 top, bottom.
135

135

00:06:50,270  -->  00:06:52,590
30 left and right.
136

136

00:06:52,590  -->  00:06:54,020
And now all we have to do
137

137

00:06:54,020  -->  00:06:56,930
is actually make these two,
138

138

00:06:56,930  -->  00:06:58,840
basically push them to the right side
139

139

00:06:58,840  -->  00:07:00,190
all the way that they can.
140

140

00:07:00,190  -->  00:07:01,930
There are two ways of doing this.
141

141

00:07:01,930  -->  00:07:03,560
So let's think about it.
142

142

00:07:03,560  -->  00:07:06,410
Well, first we could make it so this title here,
143

143

00:07:06,410  -->  00:07:07,250
this heading,
144

144

00:07:07,250  -->  00:07:09,500
occupies all the empty space.
145

145

00:07:09,500  -->  00:07:11,560
Right, that would automatically push these two
146

146

00:07:11,560  -->  00:07:12,543
to the right side.
147

147

00:07:13,400  -->  00:07:15,573
Okay, so let me show that to you.
148

148

00:07:16,730  -->  00:07:19,900
We could say flex one.
149

149

00:07:19,900  -->  00:07:21,330
And then, just like this,
150

150

00:07:21,330  -->  00:07:23,157
you saw that these two were pushed to the right.
151

151

00:07:23,157  -->  00:07:26,670
Now let's actually take a look at that in the inspector.
152

152

00:07:26,670  -->  00:07:28,353
In the Chrome dev tools.
153

153

00:07:34,790  -->  00:07:35,623
So you see,
154

154

00:07:35,623  -->  00:07:37,260
it now occupies this entire space here.
155

155

00:07:37,260  -->  00:07:41,433
Whether, when we remove it, then it only has this space.
156

156

00:07:42,800  -->  00:07:43,730
Now this is not ideal
157

157

00:07:43,730  -->  00:07:47,110
because actually the element should really end here.
158

158

00:07:47,110  -->  00:07:52,110
This h1 should kinda end here where it does end actually
159

159

00:07:52,717  -->  00:07:56,780
and not expand like that all the way to the right side.
160

160

00:07:56,780  -->  00:07:58,710
Okay, instead what we can do...
161

161

00:07:58,710  -->  00:08:00,930
Let me bring that down here a bit.
162

162

00:08:00,930  -->  00:08:02,440
What we can do instead
163

163

00:08:02,440  -->  00:08:04,030
is to give it a margin right
164

164

00:08:06,210  -->  00:08:08,890
and set that one to auto
165

165

00:08:08,890  -->  00:08:11,090
and that will visually have the same effect.
166

166

00:08:11,090  -->  00:08:15,073
But now you see that the extra space is actually a margin.
167

167

00:08:16,273  -->  00:08:17,984
And that margin will always automatically
168

168

00:08:17,984  -->  00:08:22,110
take all the empty space and occupy it.
169

169

00:08:22,110  -->  00:08:27,110
Let's say that this entire element here
170

170

00:08:27,170  -->  00:08:29,550
was a lot larger, like 900 pixels.
171

171

00:08:29,550  -->  00:08:31,350
Well, now you see that we have a lot more space here
172

172

00:08:31,350  -->  00:08:33,507
and that space is automatically occupied
173

173

00:08:33,507  -->  00:08:37,433
by that margin right set to auto.
174

174

00:08:38,800  -->  00:08:39,790
Let's get rid of that here.
175

175

00:08:39,790  -->  00:08:44,000
Of course, we want 800.
176

176

00:08:44,000  -->  00:08:46,402
Okay, that was just to demonstrate it to you.
177

177

00:08:46,402  -->  00:08:49,646
So nice, again we used Flexbox and a couple of techniques
178

178

00:08:49,646  -->  00:08:54,646
to very easily achieve this great looking part here
179

179

00:08:54,890  -->  00:08:55,970
of this component.
180

180

00:08:55,970  -->  00:08:57,882
Okay, so I hope you start seeing
181

181

00:08:57,882  -->  00:08:59,993
how handy this actually is.
182

182

00:09:01,310  -->  00:09:02,143
So next up,
183

183

00:09:02,143  -->  00:09:03,740
we just have this small text.
184

184

00:09:03,740  -->  00:09:05,353
Let's go ahead and copy it.
185

185

00:09:06,530  -->  00:09:07,400
And then finally we will have
186

186

00:09:07,400  -->  00:09:09,373
these icons here with this data.
187

187

00:09:10,980  -->  00:09:13,430
So right after the pizza content,
188

188

00:09:13,430  -->  00:09:18,430
we have a paragraph with a class of pizza description.
189

189

00:09:22,600  -->  00:09:23,523
Then the text.
190

190

00:09:24,980  -->  00:09:26,290
And close it.
191

191

00:09:26,290  -->  00:09:29,413
So pizza description.
192

192

00:09:33,800  -->  00:09:36,590
And I think there's something wrong here.
193

193

00:09:36,590  -->  00:09:38,680
Oh yeah, so I put this paragraph
194

194

00:09:38,680  -->  00:09:40,200
outside of the pizza content
195

195

00:09:40,200  -->  00:09:43,180
and so now we basically have four flex items
196

196

00:09:43,180  -->  00:09:45,240
in this pizza container.
197

197

00:09:45,240  -->  00:09:48,180
But that's not where I want this to be obviously.
198

198

00:09:48,180  -->  00:09:52,720
It should still be inside of the pizza content.
199

199

00:09:52,720  -->  00:09:54,920
So right after this one actually.
200

200

00:09:54,920  -->  00:09:55,780
So let's see.
201

201

00:09:55,780  -->  00:09:57,280
Yeah, that looks a lot better.
202

202

00:09:58,550  -->  00:10:02,400
So let's just give this a font size of 14 pixels.
203

203

00:10:02,400  -->  00:10:06,820
And then give some margin to the pizza heading,
204

204

00:10:06,820  -->  00:10:08,070
actually the pizza title.
205

205

00:10:11,510  -->  00:10:15,023
Margin bottom and let's say 20 pixels.
206

206

00:10:16,170  -->  00:10:18,380
And so finally, let's create an element
207

207

00:10:18,380  -->  00:10:22,790
which will then contain these three elements here.
208

208

00:10:22,790  -->  00:10:26,143
So these three data about this pizza.
209

209

00:10:27,850  -->  00:10:31,653
So that is gonna be called the pizza details.
210

210

00:10:46,280  -->  00:10:51,280
Alright, in there we have three pizza detail.
211

211

00:10:51,679  -->  00:10:52,512
So without the S.
212

212

00:10:52,512  -->  00:10:54,223
So three paragraphs basically.
213

213

00:11:00,850  -->  00:11:02,920
So one pizza detail.
214

214

00:11:02,920  -->  00:11:04,910
And I will have a small span here
215

215

00:11:04,910  -->  00:11:05,743
for the emoji
216

216

00:11:05,743  -->  00:11:07,923
so I can give it some margin to the right.
217

217

00:11:08,920  -->  00:11:13,920
So span class, actually just gonna call it emoji.
218

218

00:11:15,850  -->  00:11:18,823
And the first one is the pizza emoji.
219

219

00:11:22,180  -->  00:11:23,033
And here it is.
220

220

00:11:25,640  -->  00:11:26,570
Close that one
221

221

00:11:26,570  -->  00:11:30,423
and now we say it has 850 kilocalories.
222

222

00:11:33,650  -->  00:11:35,653
And let's just close it and copy this.
223

223

00:11:36,690  -->  00:11:37,723
Two times.
224

224

00:11:39,770  -->  00:11:43,143
So now let's use the clock and here it is.
225

225

00:11:46,260  -->  00:11:49,483
Say that it's gonna take 30 minutes.
226

226

00:11:51,210  -->  00:11:54,110
And then finally we have the star
227

227

00:11:56,320  -->  00:11:57,660
basically for the rating.
228

228

00:11:57,660  -->  00:12:01,343
So we have 4.7 out of five.
229

229

00:12:03,220  -->  00:12:07,010
Alright, so pizza details and pizza detail.
230

230

00:12:13,100  -->  00:12:17,080
And also one class for the emoji.
231

231

00:12:17,080  -->  00:12:18,160
So first of all,
232

232

00:12:18,160  -->  00:12:20,060
put all the three side by side.
233

233

00:12:20,060  -->  00:12:23,080
And nothing could be easier than that, right?
234

234

00:12:23,080  -->  00:12:26,458
Display flex and bam, here we go.
235

235

00:12:26,458  -->  00:12:29,123
Now let's style the text in there.
236

236

00:12:30,280  -->  00:12:32,233
We have font size of 15 pixels.
237

237

00:12:36,150  -->  00:12:38,800
Have a text transform of uppercase
238

238

00:12:40,280  -->  00:12:42,363
to give them this modern look.
239

239

00:12:44,350  -->  00:12:46,333
And a margin to the right of 20 pixels.
240

240

00:12:48,590  -->  00:12:50,800
We can also make them bold
241

241

00:12:50,800  -->  00:12:53,640
by saying font weight 700
242

242

00:12:53,640  -->  00:12:55,710
and that should be enough for now.
243

243

00:12:55,710  -->  00:12:57,050
And we want these icons here
244

244

00:12:57,050  -->  00:12:59,280
actually a bit bigger than the text.
245

245

00:12:59,280  -->  00:13:03,260
So let's say font size 20 pixels.
246

246

00:13:03,260  -->  00:13:06,333
And I'm doing this so we can use some more Flexbox.
247

247

00:13:06,333  -->  00:13:11,333
Margin right just three pixels.
248

248

00:13:12,610  -->  00:13:13,443
But now you'll see
249

249

00:13:13,443  -->  00:13:16,350
that they aren't really aligned vertically, right?
250

250

00:13:16,350  -->  00:13:18,530
This is not really fine.
251

251

00:13:18,530  -->  00:13:21,410
So in here, in pizza details, we should fix that.
252

252

00:13:21,410  -->  00:13:22,980
And again, it's very easy.
253

253

00:13:22,980  -->  00:13:25,880
All we have to do is say, display flex.
254

254

00:13:29,030  -->  00:13:31,120
And, of course, they are already side by side.
255

255

00:13:31,120  -->  00:13:34,347
And now just say align items center.
256

256

00:13:37,480  -->  00:13:38,617
And here we go.
257

257

00:13:38,617  -->  00:13:40,600
And this already looks good.
258

258

00:13:40,600  -->  00:13:43,570
We could now experiment some more here with Flexbox.
259

259

00:13:43,570  -->  00:13:44,403
For example,
260

260

00:13:44,403  -->  00:13:45,803
let's say that we actually want to center
261

261

00:13:45,803  -->  00:13:49,293
all of these flex items inside its container.
262

262

00:13:50,150  -->  00:13:52,320
The container is pizza details, right?
263

263

00:13:52,320  -->  00:13:55,370
Let's say we wanna center them along the main axis.
264

264

00:13:55,370  -->  00:13:57,510
So in this direction.
265

265

00:13:57,510  -->  00:14:01,677
We could do this and say, justify content center.
266

266

00:14:03,900  -->  00:14:06,330
And that will look like this.
267

267

00:14:06,330  -->  00:14:08,160
But there are actually more properties
268

268

00:14:08,160  -->  00:14:09,320
that I haven't talked about yet.
269

269

00:14:09,320  -->  00:14:10,540
So let me show them to you.
270

270

00:14:10,540  -->  00:14:12,380
Another thing that we can do
271

271

00:14:12,380  -->  00:14:15,380
is to basically divide the empty space that is left
272

272

00:14:15,380  -->  00:14:19,460
between basically the gaps of these items.
273

273

00:14:19,460  -->  00:14:20,950
Let me show that to you.
274

274

00:14:20,950  -->  00:14:24,930
Justify content and it's called space between.
275

275

00:14:24,930  -->  00:14:26,850
And you can see that this element
276

276

00:14:26,850  -->  00:14:29,600
goes all the way to the right, or actually to the left.
277

277

00:14:29,600  -->  00:14:30,980
This one here goes all the way to the right.
278

278

00:14:30,980  -->  00:14:34,230
And then a space here in between them is the same.
279

279

00:14:34,230  -->  00:14:35,360
So this one is centered
280

280

00:14:35,360  -->  00:14:39,520
and we have now the space all around is all the same.
281

281

00:14:39,520  -->  00:14:42,110
So that is space between.
282

282

00:14:42,110  -->  00:14:44,600
There is also space around and space evenly.
283

283

00:14:44,600  -->  00:14:47,490
But I don't think these are really useful.
284

284

00:14:47,490  -->  00:14:50,290
Let me just show them to you very quick.
285

285

00:14:50,290  -->  00:14:52,830
And what it does is each flex item
286

286

00:14:52,830  -->  00:14:54,590
will have the exact same space
287

287

00:14:54,590  -->  00:14:57,223
on its left and its right side.
288

288

00:14:59,310  -->  00:15:02,620
So space between I believe is the most useful of them.
289

289

00:15:02,620  -->  00:15:05,020
And actually you will use them from time to time.
290

290

00:15:05,020  -->  00:15:07,690
Okay, so now in this case we don't want any of this.
291

291

00:15:07,690  -->  00:15:09,440
We just want them to be in the beginning
292

292

00:15:09,440  -->  00:15:11,790
and that is basically the default.
293

293

00:15:11,790  -->  00:15:15,120
So flex start will put them exactly where they were.
294

294

00:15:15,120  -->  00:15:16,560
Of course, there's also flex end
295

295

00:15:16,560  -->  00:15:18,560
to push them all the way to the right side.
296

296

00:15:18,560  -->  00:15:21,050
But that's also not really what we want.
297

297

00:15:21,050  -->  00:15:22,780
So we can just get rid of this
298

298

00:15:22,780  -->  00:15:24,879
because the start is, as you know,
299

299

00:15:24,879  -->  00:15:27,000
the default anyway.
300

300

00:15:27,000  -->  00:15:27,940
Now we're almost done.
301

301

00:15:27,940  -->  00:15:30,880
All there is to do is to push this entire element here
302

302

00:15:30,880  -->  00:15:32,070
so the pizza details,
303

303

00:15:32,070  -->  00:15:34,523
all the way to the bottom as much as we can.
304

304

00:15:35,384  -->  00:15:36,970
So how could we achieve that?
305

305

00:15:36,970  -->  00:15:39,993
Well, it would be really nice to use Flexbox for that.
306

306

00:15:40,980  -->  00:15:43,410
Now the default behavior for Flexbox
307

307

00:15:43,410  -->  00:15:46,040
is to put elements side by side.
308

308

00:15:46,040  -->  00:15:47,890
So we can push, as we did here,
309

309

00:15:47,890  -->  00:15:49,810
these elements all the way to the right side.
310

310

00:15:49,810  -->  00:15:53,520
Remember we did the margin right and set it to auto here
311

311

00:15:53,520  -->  00:15:54,410
on this element,
312

312

00:15:54,410  -->  00:15:56,670
which then pushed these two all the way to the right.
313

313

00:15:56,670  -->  00:15:57,610
But up until this point,
314

314

00:15:57,610  -->  00:16:00,140
we only did this in the horizontal direction
315

315

00:16:00,140  -->  00:16:01,300
which is the default.
316

316

00:16:01,300  -->  00:16:02,920
But we can change that.
317

317

00:16:02,920  -->  00:16:06,550
So we can actually make Flexbox not go from left to right.
318

318

00:16:06,550  -->  00:16:08,840
So put all the elements side by side
319

319

00:16:08,840  -->  00:16:11,420
so the elements go one after the other
320

320

00:16:11,420  -->  00:16:12,684
and so the main axis,
321

321

00:16:12,684  -->  00:16:15,100
which was originally in this way,
322

322

00:16:15,100  -->  00:16:17,760
will then be from top to bottom like this.
323

323

00:16:17,760  -->  00:16:19,860
Okay, so let me show that to you again.
324

324

00:16:19,860  -->  00:16:21,160
And in order to do that,
325

325

00:16:21,160  -->  00:16:23,280
I will now set pizza content
326

326

00:16:23,280  -->  00:16:25,060
which is the entire wide element,
327

327

00:16:25,060  -->  00:16:27,063
and we'll set it to Flexbox.
328

328

00:16:28,575  -->  00:16:30,343
And so, where do we have that?
329

329

00:16:31,260  -->  00:16:34,413
It is the flex content.
330

330

00:16:35,290  -->  00:16:38,700
So I will say display flex.
331

331

00:16:38,700  -->  00:16:41,000
And watch what happens now by default
332

332

00:16:41,000  -->  00:16:43,490
if I put all of these side by side.
333

333

00:16:43,490  -->  00:16:45,150
Just what we expected.
334

334

00:16:45,150  -->  00:16:49,230
Because that's default behavior of Flexbox.
335

335

00:16:49,230  -->  00:16:50,890
But let's now actually change that.
336

336

00:16:50,890  -->  00:16:54,710
We do that by using the flex direction property.
337

337

00:16:54,710  -->  00:16:57,710
And the default for flex direction is row.
338

338

00:16:57,710  -->  00:17:01,255
So that's why we get all of these elements here in one row.
339

339

00:17:01,255  -->  00:17:05,333
But we can also change it to column.
340

340

00:17:08,197  -->  00:17:10,090
And then it's gonna look like this.
341

341

00:17:10,090  -->  00:17:12,930
Basically, it's gonna look exactly like it did before.
342

342

00:17:12,930  -->  00:17:15,094
Okay, but these are now actually flex items
343

343

00:17:15,094  -->  00:17:17,150
we can now manipulate.
344

344

00:17:17,150  -->  00:17:19,060
We could now say,
345

345

00:17:19,060  -->  00:17:24,060
align items, which is along the cross axis remember, center.
346

346

00:17:25,780  -->  00:17:27,464
So what do you think will happen?
347

347

00:17:27,464  -->  00:17:31,010
So it centered these along the cross axis.
348

348

00:17:31,010  -->  00:17:33,465
And since our main axis is now this way here,
349

349

00:17:33,465  -->  00:17:36,810
the cross axis is this way.
350

350

00:17:36,810  -->  00:17:38,240
Alright, makes sense?
351

351

00:17:38,240  -->  00:17:39,550
So that's why align items
352

352

00:17:39,550  -->  00:17:42,073
works in this direction here as well.
353

353

00:17:43,340  -->  00:17:47,033
Okay, we could also do justify content.
354

354

00:17:49,970  -->  00:17:51,180
And set that one to center.
355

355

00:17:51,180  -->  00:17:53,550
And try to guess what's gonna happen.
356

356

00:17:53,550  -->  00:17:55,600
Yep, it's gonna put all of these elements
357

357

00:17:55,600  -->  00:17:57,860
in the center along the main axis
358

358

00:17:57,860  -->  00:18:00,683
which now is, remember, from top to bottom.
359

359

00:18:02,270  -->  00:18:06,030
Alright, so that's one very important aspect
360

360

00:18:06,030  -->  00:18:07,253
of Flexbox as well
361

361

00:18:07,253  -->  00:18:10,140
that we can change the flex direction.
362

362

00:18:10,140  -->  00:18:13,770
We can also do column reverse, for example.
363

363

00:18:13,770  -->  00:18:14,940
And what that's gonna do
364

364

00:18:14,940  -->  00:18:17,840
is reverse the order of the elements.
365

365

00:18:17,840  -->  00:18:19,527
So we had this at the top and this at the bottom.
366

366

00:18:19,527  -->  00:18:21,423
And so now it's inverted.
367

367

00:18:22,490  -->  00:18:26,050
Alright, but we simply want it to be a column.
368

368

00:18:26,050  -->  00:18:28,070
Now what we wanted originally to do
369

369

00:18:28,070  -->  00:18:30,540
is to push the pizza details here
370

370

00:18:30,540  -->  00:18:32,145
all the way to the bottom.
371

371

00:18:32,145  -->  00:18:34,303
And so let's do that.
372

372

00:18:35,290  -->  00:18:36,500
So pizza details.
373

373

00:18:36,500  -->  00:18:38,370
And can you guess how we're gonna do that?
374

374

00:18:38,370  -->  00:18:40,685
It's actually very similar to what we did up here
375

375

00:18:40,685  -->  00:18:42,810
in this pizza...
376

376

00:18:42,810  -->  00:18:43,703
Oh, what's that?
377

377

00:18:47,604  -->  00:18:49,186
So as I was saying,
378

378

00:18:49,186  -->  00:18:50,940
it's gonna be in a very similar way
379

379

00:18:50,940  -->  00:18:52,713
to what we did up here.
380

380

00:18:56,400  -->  00:19:01,400
All we have to do is to say margin to the top should be auto
381

381

00:19:04,360  -->  00:19:07,000
and just like this it should actually work.
382

382

00:19:07,000  -->  00:19:09,220
Well, it is in the wrong place.
383

383

00:19:09,220  -->  00:19:13,070
So of course it's not in pizza detail but in pizza details
384

384

00:19:13,070  -->  00:19:15,830
because that is the flex item, right?
385

385

00:19:15,830  -->  00:19:17,633
So margin top and there we go.
386

386

00:19:18,590  -->  00:19:22,300
This margin here is now automatically calculated by Flexbox
387

387

00:19:22,300  -->  00:19:25,223
in order to occupy this empty space.
388

388

00:19:26,259  -->  00:19:29,140
Let's actually check that out here using the dev tools again
389

389

00:19:29,140  -->  00:19:32,190
and you will see we have all this margin
390

390

00:19:32,190  -->  00:19:34,070
as you see here in this orange color.
391

391

00:19:34,070  -->  00:19:37,793
So that is the margin that is defined by margin auto.
392

392

00:19:39,762  -->  00:19:41,410
And that was the whole reason
393

393

00:19:41,410  -->  00:19:45,220
why we actually used Flexbox here on that pizza content
394

394

00:19:45,220  -->  00:19:46,670
because without Flexbox
395

395

00:19:46,670  -->  00:19:49,970
this margin auto doesn't even work like this.
396

396

00:19:49,970  -->  00:19:52,013
So if I would simply remove it from here,
397

397

00:19:52,013  -->  00:19:55,670
so if this was no longer a Flexbox item,
398

398

00:19:55,670  -->  00:19:58,143
well then it will simply look like this again.
399

399

00:19:59,770  -->  00:20:02,830
And so, I think with that we're actually done.
400

400

00:20:02,830  -->  00:20:04,775
And what we have here looks exactly the same
401

401

00:20:04,775  -->  00:20:06,383
as it does in here.
402

402

00:20:07,690  -->  00:20:09,140
So let's count how many times
403

403

00:20:09,140  -->  00:20:12,599
we actually used Flexbox in this kind of small component.
404

404

00:20:12,599  -->  00:20:17,080
One, two, three Flexbox containers.
405

405

00:20:20,500  -->  00:20:25,500
Four and five and actually six.
406

406

00:20:26,420  -->  00:20:28,410
So we actually find six flex containers
407

407

00:20:28,410  -->  00:20:30,230
just in this small component.
408

408

00:20:30,230  -->  00:20:31,890
And that is enough to show you
409

409

00:20:31,890  -->  00:20:35,450
how powerful and useful actually Flexbox is
410

410

00:20:35,450  -->  00:20:37,720
to lay out the elements on a page like this.
411

411

00:20:37,720  -->  00:20:39,050
And as your websites grow,
412

412

00:20:39,050  -->  00:20:41,368
you'll see yourself using it all over the place
413

413

00:20:41,368  -->  00:20:43,034
and all the time.
414

414

00:20:43,034  -->  00:20:44,540
As an exercise,
415

415

00:20:44,540  -->  00:20:47,007
you could try to recreate the exact same thing
416

416

00:20:47,007  -->  00:20:49,447
but without using Flexbox
417

417

00:20:49,447  -->  00:20:52,830
and instead using margins and floats.
418

418

00:20:52,830  -->  00:20:55,900
And you will then see how much more code you will write
419

419

00:20:55,900  -->  00:20:57,400
and how much longer it's gonna take you
420

420

00:20:57,400  -->  00:21:00,300
and how much more difficult it'll probably be.
421

421

00:21:00,300  -->  00:21:01,133
So if you have the time,
422

422

00:21:01,133  -->  00:21:04,340
that will probably be a great exercise.
423

423

00:21:04,340  -->  00:21:05,385
Now as I said in the beginning,
424

424

00:21:05,385  -->  00:21:07,220
in this small project,
425

425

00:21:07,220  -->  00:21:10,910
of course we barely just scratched the surface of Flexbox.
426

426

00:21:10,910  -->  00:21:12,770
There is so much more to learn.
427

427

00:21:12,770  -->  00:21:14,010
Many more techniques
428

428

00:21:14,010  -->  00:21:16,050
and all the properties that it includes.
429

429

00:21:16,050  -->  00:21:17,807
But in this small video I, of course,
430

430

00:21:17,807  -->  00:21:19,040
couldn't do all that
431

431

00:21:19,040  -->  00:21:21,610
because that requires an entire new course.
432

432

00:21:21,610  -->  00:21:23,110
And that brings me actually
433

433

00:21:23,110  -->  00:21:26,200
to the other new course that I have here on Udemy
434

434

00:21:26,200  -->  00:21:28,450
which is called Advanced CSS and Sass.
435

435

00:21:28,450  -->  00:21:30,740
And it teaches you all these new properties
436

436

00:21:30,740  -->  00:21:33,160
that I talked about in the beginning of the video,
437

437

00:21:33,160  -->  00:21:34,400
or actually in the last video,
438

438

00:21:34,400  -->  00:21:35,470
and so much more.
439

439

00:21:35,470  -->  00:21:37,050
So it has three different projects
440

440

00:21:37,050  -->  00:21:39,712
where you will learn to use all these advanced techniques.
441

441

00:21:39,712  -->  00:21:43,510
You will have one project that is only just for Flexbox
442

442

00:21:43,510  -->  00:21:46,190
where you're gonna code a huge design using Flexbox.
443

443

00:21:46,190  -->  00:21:48,840
And also a project using just CSS grid
444

444

00:21:48,840  -->  00:21:51,520
to learn the most cutting edge layout technology
445

445

00:21:51,520  -->  00:21:53,520
that we have right now in CSS.
446

446

00:21:53,520  -->  00:21:55,650
Okay, so give it a try
447

447

00:21:55,650  -->  00:21:57,110
and if it sounds interesting,
448

448

00:21:57,110  -->  00:21:58,940
then of course I am more than happy
449

449

00:21:58,940  -->  00:22:01,440
to welcome you into that course as well.
450

450

00:22:01,440  -->  00:22:03,210
That's all I have to tell you for now.
451

451

00:22:03,210  -->  00:22:05,993
I hope you like this video and see you next time.
