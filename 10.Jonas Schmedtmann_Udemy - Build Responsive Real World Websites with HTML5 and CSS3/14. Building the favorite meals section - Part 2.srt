<v Voiceover>Hello back and welcome to part 2 of</v>
2

2

00:00:04,200  -->  00:00:06,780 line:15% 
Building the favorite meals section.
3

3

00:00:06,780  -->  00:00:10,394 line:15% 
Let's go straight back into brackets.
4

4

00:00:10,394  -->  00:00:13,894
So let's continue formatting this section.
5

5

00:00:13,894  -->  00:00:17,354
Now the first thing we notice and that we didn't correct yet
6

6

00:00:17,354  -->  00:00:21,354
is this large distance between this two section,
7

7

00:00:21,354  -->  00:00:24,714
which doesn't look natural and that's because
8

8

00:00:24,714  -->  00:00:28,154
this section like the other section, as well,
9

9

00:00:28,154  -->  00:00:31,571
has a big padding which goes like, until,
10

10

00:00:33,224  -->  00:00:34,057
here.
11

11

00:00:34,985  -->  00:00:37,484
We actually don't want this section to having padding.
12

12

00:00:37,484  -->  00:00:38,844
Because it's a different section,
13

13

00:00:38,844  -->  00:00:41,384
it doesn't have a title and everything
14

14

00:00:41,384  -->  00:00:45,551
so we don't want this section to have a padding like that.
15

15

00:00:48,004  -->  00:00:50,504
So let's quickly correct that.
16

16

00:00:53,024  -->  00:00:55,684
So this section is called,
17

17

00:00:55,684  -->  00:00:58,517
Section, I honestly don't remember
18

18

00:01:00,104  -->  00:01:01,521
Meals, of course.
19

19

00:01:03,264  -->  00:01:04,681
So section-meals,
20

20

00:01:06,644  -->  00:01:09,144
I will say padding zero
21

21

00:01:10,100  -->  00:01:12,933
and that should solve the problem.
22

22

00:01:14,600  -->  00:01:17,600
Yeah so this looks much better.
23

23

00:01:19,859  -->  00:01:22,359
And next, next we will do that
24

24

00:01:23,806  -->  00:01:25,026
animation
25

25

00:01:25,026  -->  00:01:27,286
I was telling you about.
26

26

00:01:27,286  -->  00:01:29,606
Now what this animation is all about
27

27

00:01:29,606  -->  00:01:32,856
is that when we hover one of the images
28

28

00:01:33,926  -->  00:01:38,093
the image kind of zooms out and also gets lighter.
29

29

00:01:40,166  -->  00:01:43,746
So we want to make the image dark and zoom in
30

30

00:01:43,746  -->  00:01:46,326
so that when we hover the image,
31

31

00:01:46,326  -->  00:01:49,659
the image can zoom out and get brighter.
32

32

00:01:52,406  -->  00:01:55,656
Once I see this, you will get the idea.
33

33

00:01:58,486  -->  00:02:01,175
So we can use a powerful
34

34

00:02:01,175  -->  00:02:02,758
CSS3
35

35

00:02:03,683  -->  00:02:05,123
property,
36

36

00:02:05,123  -->  00:02:07,163
which is transform.
37

37

00:02:07,163  -->  00:02:10,744
We actually already used that before,
38

38

00:02:10,744  -->  00:02:13,083
now we're going to use it again.
39

39

00:02:13,083  -->  00:02:16,500
So in this case, we will scale the image,
40

40

00:02:17,923  -->  00:02:21,803
in fact, all of the images we will scale them
41

41

00:02:21,803  -->  00:02:23,886
to like, 1.15,
42

42

00:02:25,118  -->  00:02:27,338
and this means that the image
43

43

00:02:27,338  -->  00:02:31,163
will be instead of 100%,
44

44

00:02:31,163  -->  00:02:33,996
it will be 115% big.
45

45

00:02:37,842  -->  00:02:40,342
So let's see this in practice.
46

46

00:02:43,202  -->  00:02:45,452
So these images have grown.
47

47

00:02:46,682  -->  00:02:50,349
They are bigger than they are supposed to be
48

48

00:02:51,202  -->  00:02:55,082
and you see they even go out off the browser width.
49

49

00:02:55,082  -->  00:02:58,502
It's even bigger than the browser now.
50

50

00:02:58,502  -->  00:03:01,862
And we will fix that in a moment
51

51

00:03:01,862  -->  00:03:06,122
because we don't want these images to be bigger
52

52

00:03:06,122  -->  00:03:09,702
than their container, which is meal-photo.
53

53

00:03:09,702  -->  00:03:11,962
So right now, the image just kind of
54

54

00:03:11,962  -->  00:03:13,962
overflows its container.
55

55

00:03:15,322  -->  00:03:17,062
So what can we do about this?
56

56

00:03:17,062  -->  00:03:20,782
There's a nice little property called overflow
57

57

00:03:20,782  -->  00:03:23,002
and if we set it to hidden,
58

58

00:03:23,002  -->  00:03:25,122
then that overflow will not be visible
59

59

00:03:25,122  -->  00:03:27,482
and we just see the part of the image
60

60

00:03:27,482  -->  00:03:29,922
which is still inside of the container.
61

61

00:03:29,922  -->  00:03:31,005
So let's see.
62

62

00:03:32,922  -->  00:03:36,902
Alright, so this is exactly what we want
63

63

00:03:36,902  -->  00:03:41,107
and now what we want is to change that transform
64

64

00:03:41,107  -->  00:03:44,440
property when we hover the image, right?
65

65

00:03:46,085  -->  00:03:48,168
So let's do exactly that.
66

66

00:03:50,005  -->  00:03:53,838
And maybe you already see where this is going.
67

67

00:03:54,765  -->  00:03:56,905
So what I'm doing now is
68

68

00:03:56,905  -->  00:04:00,238
meal-photo image
69

69

00:04:01,084  -->  00:04:03,635
and now we can also use this
70

70

00:04:03,635  -->  00:04:05,885
hover state for everything.
71

71

00:04:06,875  -->  00:04:09,255
This doesn't work only for links
72

72

00:04:09,255  -->  00:04:12,838
even if we only use it for links until now,
73

73

00:04:13,695  -->  00:04:16,945
but it works really with every element.
74

74

00:04:18,455  -->  00:04:21,195
And so what do we want to happen?
75

75

00:04:21,195  -->  00:04:23,778
We want this transform
76

76

00:04:24,704  -->  00:04:27,037
to go back to normal, right?
77

77

00:04:28,344  -->  00:04:30,177
So we scale it to one.
78

78

00:04:33,424  -->  00:04:37,424
Let's see if this works and if you get the idea.
79

79

00:04:38,805  -->  00:04:41,138
So, so this is what happens.
80

80

00:04:42,805  -->  00:04:47,545
Don't worry, we will put an animation there in a moment,
81

81

00:04:47,545  -->  00:04:49,628
but this is what happens.
82

82

00:04:51,305  -->  00:04:54,105
And you see there is actually, like,
83

83

00:04:54,105  -->  00:04:56,605
a while little line down there
84

84

00:04:58,665  -->  00:05:01,625
and I actually can't tell you why that happens,
85

85

00:05:01,625  -->  00:05:03,865
but I know a good solution to that.
86

86

00:05:03,865  -->  00:05:06,782
So instead of scaling it until one,
87

87

00:05:08,725  -->  00:05:11,308
I'm just gonna scale it to 1.03
88

88

00:05:14,125  -->  00:05:17,025
and this should solve the problem.
89

89

00:05:17,025  -->  00:05:18,785
And also I want to, of course,
90

90

00:05:18,785  -->  00:05:21,035
animate this transformation
91

91

00:05:22,565  -->  00:05:24,648
so what, how can I do it?
92

92

00:05:25,553  -->  00:05:26,386
I say
93

93

00:05:28,222  -->  00:05:29,555
transition
94

94

00:05:30,912  -->  00:05:32,412
and then transform
95

95

00:05:33,972  -->  00:05:36,756
and let's say
96

96

00:05:36,756  -->  00:05:39,339
hold for seconds 0.5 seconds
97

97

00:05:41,839  -->  00:05:43,759
and this should already do the job.
98

98

00:05:43,759  -->  00:05:45,559
So this is exactly the same thing
99

99

00:05:45,559  -->  00:05:49,559
as we did with our links here, right?
100

100

00:05:50,960  -->  00:05:54,340
We defined the transition with the interval
101

101

00:05:54,340  -->  00:05:56,840
and then with the hover state,
102

102

00:05:58,040  -->  00:06:00,207
we said what would happen.
103

103

00:06:01,600  -->  00:06:05,767
So this is what we did right here so let's check it out.
104

104

00:06:08,440  -->  00:06:11,040
Okay, this is very nice, right?
105

105

00:06:11,040  -->  00:06:13,520
This is really, really cool, don't you think so?
106

106

00:06:13,520  -->  00:06:15,520
It's a beautiful effect,
107

107

00:06:16,760  -->  00:06:20,680
but we will go even further than this.
108

108

00:06:20,680  -->  00:06:23,660
So, as I said in the beginning,
109

109

00:06:23,660  -->  00:06:26,020
we will make this image darker
110

110

00:06:26,020  -->  00:06:29,853
and then as we hover it, we'll make it lighter
111

111

00:06:30,720  -->  00:06:33,500
and that's quite easy to do.
112

112

00:06:33,500  -->  00:06:36,920
As we built the header, we learned how to make
113

113

00:06:36,920  -->  00:06:40,900
a background image darker, which was our here image, right?
114

114

00:06:40,900  -->  00:06:44,920
And now let's try to make this image darker.
115

115

00:06:44,920  -->  00:06:48,680
Let me show you how we're going to do that.
116

116

00:06:48,680  -->  00:06:52,263
So if we set the opacity,
117

117

00:06:53,637  -->  00:06:56,457
yet another CSS property,
118

118

00:06:56,457  -->  00:07:00,637
you see, you're using a lot of properties here.
119

119

00:07:00,637  -->  00:07:02,557
I mean, I'm covering almost everything
120

120

00:07:02,557  -->  00:07:07,097
that you need to know with just this website.
121

121

00:07:07,097  -->  00:07:10,588
So opacity 0.7,
122

122

00:07:10,588  -->  00:07:14,421
so this is 70%.
123

123

00:07:15,668  -->  00:07:19,028
Just to show you, let me show you what this looks like.
124

124

00:07:19,028  -->  00:07:22,608
So this is kind of white now and it's white
125

125

00:07:22,608  -->  00:07:24,528
because its background is white
126

126

00:07:24,528  -->  00:07:27,427
so if we want to make this darker,
127

127

00:07:27,427  -->  00:07:31,446
we just put the background
128

128

00:07:31,446  -->  00:07:33,363
of this image to black,
129

129

00:07:35,366  -->  00:07:37,866
zero zero zero.
130

130

00:07:37,866  -->  00:07:42,566
So behind that image, we now have a black container
131

131

00:07:42,566  -->  00:07:45,483
and since this image is now opaque,
132

132

00:07:46,925  -->  00:07:48,508
it will get darker.
133

133

00:07:51,285  -->  00:07:52,368
Very well
134

134

00:07:53,705  -->  00:07:57,104
This looks really great, right?
135

135

00:07:57,104  -->  00:07:59,575
And now we just have to
136

136

00:07:59,575  -->  00:08:01,158
animate
137

137

00:08:02,780  -->  00:08:04,197
the opacity here.
138

138

00:08:06,653  -->  00:08:10,820
So when we hover, we also want the opacity to change
139

139

00:08:11,673  -->  00:08:14,340
back to one, which is 100%,
140

140

00:08:17,413  -->  00:08:20,733
and in order to animate it, we put it right here
141

141

00:08:20,733  -->  00:08:22,400
so opacity
142

142

00:08:23,692  -->  00:08:27,109
opacity 0.5 seconds
143

143

00:08:29,015  -->  00:08:33,182
and now we should see both of the things animated.
144

144

00:08:35,175  -->  00:08:38,995
And here we go, wow this is really exciting, right?
145

145

00:08:38,995  -->  00:08:40,662
This looks so great.
146

146

00:08:43,915  -->  00:08:46,255
You see how simple this was?
147

147

00:08:46,255  -->  00:08:49,672
So I think the section is also done here.
148

148

00:08:51,275  -->  00:08:53,915
Another thing that I noticed
149

149

00:08:53,915  -->  00:08:57,115
when I was revisiting this section here
150

150

00:08:57,115  -->  00:08:58,655
was that we maybe need some space
151

151

00:08:58,655  -->  00:09:02,488
between this paragraph here and these columns.
152

152

00:09:03,435  -->  00:09:04,435
So what I'm going to do is
153

153

00:09:04,435  -->  00:09:08,602
add some bottom margin to this paragraph.
154

154

00:09:12,264  -->  00:09:16,014
So if you remember, it's the long-copy class,
155

155

00:09:17,024  -->  00:09:19,469
and I will again
156

156

00:09:19,469  -->  00:09:23,029
make a little section here for that
157

157

00:09:23,029  -->  00:09:26,946
called features.
158

158

00:09:29,368  -->  00:09:32,368
Alright, because
159

159

00:09:34,312  -->  00:09:38,332
where is it, so it's this, it's this class,
160

160

00:09:38,332  -->  00:09:43,210
but I don't want to make a margin to
161

161

00:09:43,210  -->  00:09:45,890
to all long-copy class
162

162

00:09:45,890  -->  00:09:49,890
element that we will use throughout the website.
163

163

00:09:51,510  -->  00:09:54,531
So again I'm using the long-copy
164

164

00:09:54,531  -->  00:09:57,031
inside of the section-features
165

165

00:09:58,011  -->  00:10:00,094
so let me just copy this.
166

166

00:10:01,391  -->  00:10:04,611
See, this is a very usual practice.
167

167

00:10:04,611  -->  00:10:08,090
So section-features and then the long-copy,
168

168

00:10:08,090  -->  00:10:10,090
which is inside of that,
169

169

00:10:11,090  -->  00:10:14,590
and then we just specify its margin bottom
170

170

00:10:15,450  -->  00:10:17,367
and set it to 40 pixels
171

171

00:10:20,110  -->  00:10:21,610
and now,
172

172

00:10:23,630  -->  00:10:26,550
this looks much better right?
173

173

00:10:26,550  -->  00:10:29,530
Okay, probably 40 was a little too much.
174

174

00:10:29,530  -->  00:10:31,590
Again, this is, this is really designing
175

175

00:10:31,590  -->  00:10:34,673
in the browser and it's really great.
176

176

00:10:38,130  -->  00:10:42,790
Yeah, this looks cool now, don't you think so?
177

177

00:10:42,790  -->  00:10:45,730
So let me revisit the whole thing.
178

178

00:10:45,730  -->  00:10:48,250
We designed this section,
179

179

00:10:48,250  -->  00:10:50,730
everything beautiful,
180

180

00:10:50,730  -->  00:10:53,350
then we did this section,
181

181

00:10:53,350  -->  00:10:58,010
and now we even have this powerful transition stuff.
182

182

00:10:58,010  -->  00:11:01,177
Wow, you've learned such a lot so far,
183

183

00:11:02,030  -->  00:11:04,030
a lot of CSS properties.
184

184

00:11:04,890  -->  00:11:07,910
You should probably take note of them
185

185

00:11:07,910  -->  00:11:10,770
or copy them somewhere so that you have
186

186

00:11:10,770  -->  00:11:14,770
a whole list of things that you can do with CSS.
187

187

00:11:16,290  -->  00:11:20,550
So that's it for now and maybe you want to take a break now
188

188

00:11:20,550  -->  00:11:24,050
or you can just join me in the next lecture,
189

189

00:11:24,050  -->  00:11:26,950
where we will design our next section.
190

190

00:11:26,950  -->  00:11:29,033
So see you there and bye.
