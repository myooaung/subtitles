00:00:01.389  -->  00:00:04.492
<v Voiceover>I hope you're excited for yet another lecture</v>
2

2

00:00:04.492  -->  00:00:07.234
on our killer website project.
3

3

00:00:07.234  -->  00:00:09.924
In this lecture, we'll build a section
4

4

00:00:09.924  -->  00:00:14.450
where the user can see in which cities OmniFoot works.
5

5

00:00:14.450  -->  00:00:18.267
And here is a simple way of showing exactly that.
6

6

00:00:18.267  -->  00:00:22.303
Just an image of each city with some details below them,
7

7

00:00:22.303  -->  00:00:24.386
beautifully side by side.
8

8

00:00:25.414  -->  00:00:29.925
And in this lecture, we'll practice some of our new skills.
9

9

00:00:29.925  -->  00:00:32.201
We'll also learn how to use small icons
10

10

00:00:32.201  -->  00:00:34.546
aligned with some text.
11

11

00:00:34.546  -->  00:00:38.771
This is a little trickier than the big icons we used before.
12

12

00:00:38.771  -->  00:00:43.021
And finally, we'll learn how to best style generic links.
13

13

00:00:43.021  -->  00:00:46.884
Which are the normal text links you usually see
14

14

00:00:46.884  -->  00:00:49.491
on all kind of websites.
15

15

00:00:49.491  -->  00:00:52.521
So let's start this, right now.
16

16

00:00:52.521  -->  00:00:54.438
Okay, back in brackets.
17

17

00:00:55.272  -->  00:00:57.939
Now, as you are already used to,
18

18

00:00:58.930  -->  00:01:02.430
we will start in your section and name it.
19

19

00:01:03.468  -->  00:01:06.374
This one is called section
20

20

00:01:06.374  -->  00:01:07.580
cities,
21

21

00:01:07.580  -->  00:01:11.063
because we're showing our cities here.
22

22

00:01:11.063  -->  00:01:13.482
And now we do the exact same thing
23

23

00:01:13.482  -->  00:01:15.146
as we did here.
24

24

00:01:15.146  -->  00:01:19.414
So I can actually copy it, to save us some time.
25

25

00:01:19.414  -->  00:01:22.852
So that's the title, with some text in it.
26

26

00:01:22.852  -->  00:01:27.019
And again, we will get our text from the text document.
27

27

00:01:28.980  -->  00:01:30.230
Copy all of it,
28

28

00:01:33.241  -->  00:01:34.074
and
29

29

00:01:35.680  -->  00:01:38.430
paste it down here with comments.
30

30

00:01:43.586  -->  00:01:44.669
So, copy this
31

31

00:01:46.048  -->  00:01:46.881
and
32

32

00:01:47.905  -->  00:01:49.072
paste it here.
33

33

00:01:53.008  -->  00:01:55.377
Of course we don't need this,
34

34

00:01:55.377  -->  00:01:58.558
so the title is already here.
35

35

00:01:58.558  -->  00:02:02.372
And now, as you remember we have those four
36

36

00:02:02.372  -->  00:02:05.637
columns with the photos and the details below.
37

37

00:02:05.637  -->  00:02:07.109
The photos.
38

38

00:02:07.109  -->  00:02:09.442
So, what are we gonna do?
39

39

00:02:09.442  -->  00:02:11.509
Maybe I will give you some time to practice this,
40

40

00:02:11.509  -->  00:02:14.862
because I hope you already know how to do this by now.
41

41

00:02:14.862  -->  00:02:17.034
So just pause this,
42

42

00:02:17.034  -->  00:02:18.447
and
43

43

00:02:18.447  -->  00:02:20.864
continue to code by yourself.
44

44

00:02:25.101  -->  00:02:28.970
Alright, so I hope that you managed to
45

45

00:02:28.970  -->  00:02:30.473
write some code here
46

46

00:02:30.473  -->  00:02:33.973
and now I will show you how I would do it.
47

47

00:02:36.163  -->  00:02:38.830
So of course, we need a new row.
48

48

00:02:41.076  -->  00:02:42.631
A new row
49

49

00:02:42.631  -->  00:02:43.464
and then
50

50

00:02:45.359  -->  00:02:47.499
some columns inside of it.
51

51

00:02:47.499  -->  00:02:49.249
So class column, col,
52

52

00:02:50.253  -->  00:02:52.463
and then, since we have four image
53

53

00:02:52.463  -->  00:02:53.380
span one of
54

54

00:02:54.219  -->  00:02:55.052
four.
55

55

00:02:58.848  -->  00:03:00.467
Alright,
56

56

00:03:00.467  -->  00:03:02.884
now we need our text in here.
57

57

00:03:03.983  -->  00:03:06.566
So let me see what we got here.
58

58

00:03:07.485  -->  00:03:10.774
So we have the number of happy eaters.
59

59

00:03:10.774  -->  00:03:12.797
We have the number of chefs,
60

60

00:03:12.797  -->  00:03:15.547
and we have the Twitter username
61

61

00:03:16.988  -->  00:03:19.071
of OmniFoot in this city.
62

62

00:03:20.929  -->  00:03:22.756
So what I will do here,
63

63

00:03:22.756  -->  00:03:25.756
is to use an icon for each of those,
64

64

00:03:26.677  -->  00:03:29.109
and then write the text.
65

65

00:03:29.109  -->  00:03:32.941
So an icon for the eaters, one icon for the top chefs,
66

66

00:03:32.941  -->  00:03:36.108
and one icon for the Twitter username.
67

67

00:03:38.118  -->  00:03:41.526
So let's get those icons from ionicons,
68

68

00:03:41.526  -->  00:03:43.359
such as we did before.
69

69

00:03:45.786  -->  00:03:48.283
And open their website, ionicons.
70

70

00:03:48.283  -->  00:03:49.171
It's already here.
71

71

00:03:49.171  -->  00:03:50.921
So for the first one,
72

72

00:03:51.818  -->  00:03:53.485
I will chose a user.
73

73

00:03:55.366  -->  00:03:59.533
And again I'm going down here to the part of the iOS like
74

74

00:04:01.125  -->  00:04:01.958
icons.
75

75

00:04:03.194  -->  00:04:05.527
And I want to choose a user.
76

76

00:04:06.788  -->  00:04:11.497
Let me see if I can find one, 'kay this looks great to me.
77

77

00:04:11.497  -->  00:04:13.664
So I'm going to copy this.
78

78

00:04:16.235  -->  00:04:17.735
And let's go back,
79

79

00:04:18.649  -->  00:04:19.914
and just
80

80

00:04:19.914  -->  00:04:21.307
insert
81

81

00:04:21.307  -->  00:04:22.974
an icon, right here.
82

82

00:04:23.978  -->  00:04:25.061
So the class,
83

83

00:04:26.351  -->  00:04:29.035
paste it, I hope you remember that,
84

84

00:04:29.035  -->  00:04:30.202
and that's it.
85

85

00:04:31.971  -->  00:04:33.554
And now I can just,
86

86

00:04:35.955  -->  00:04:37.538
copy the text here.
87

87

00:04:39.019  -->  00:04:40.367
1000
88

88

00:04:40.367  -->  00:04:41.450
happy eaters.
89

89

00:04:45.428  -->  00:04:48.454
Okay, but before moving on...
90

90

00:04:48.454  -->  00:04:49.787
Oh! Actually add
91

91

00:04:50.793  -->  00:04:52.043
the image here,
92

92

00:04:53.093  -->  00:04:55.185
to this column and
93

93

00:04:55.185  -->  00:04:56.018
the title.
94

94

00:04:57.333  -->  00:04:58.268
So it is
95

95

00:04:58.268  -->  00:04:59.101
an IMG
96

96

00:05:01.333  -->  00:05:05.772
and the source is inside of our resource and images.
97

97

00:05:05.772  -->  00:05:07.439
Well by now you will
98

98

00:05:08.860  -->  00:05:12.695
already know exactly how we should do that, right?
99

99

00:05:12.695  -->  00:05:16.678
So this is the image for Lisbon, which is our first city.
100

100

00:05:16.678  -->  00:05:19.261
And the alt can just be Lisbon.
101

101

00:05:22.883  -->  00:05:25.966
And then again we use our H3 element,
102

102

00:05:26.905  -->  00:05:29.572
such as we did in the other box,
103

103

00:05:30.758  -->  00:05:33.616
up here, do you remember?
104

104

00:05:33.616  -->  00:05:35.083
So we had
105

105

00:05:35.083  -->  00:05:36.500
these four boxes,
106

106

00:05:37.997  -->  00:05:39.968
it actually had the class box,
107

107

00:05:39.968  -->  00:05:41.218
and then an H3
108

108

00:05:42.922  -->  00:05:43.755
title.
109

109

00:05:45.504  -->  00:05:50.331
And I will now, also reuse this class down here.
110

110

00:05:50.331  -->  00:05:53.751
So that those boxes looks quite of similar.
111

111

00:05:53.751  -->  00:05:57.612
So I want this column here to be a box as well.
112

112

00:05:57.612  -->  00:06:00.832
So right now you start to see
113

113

00:06:00.832  -->  00:06:03.931
that we're starting to reuse some of the classes
114

114

00:06:03.931  -->  00:06:05.098
on our website
115

115

00:06:06.274  -->  00:06:08.150
and that's really nice,
116

116

00:06:08.150  -->  00:06:11.233
because that saves us time formatting
117

117

00:06:12.265  -->  00:06:17.234
and at the same time it allows us to have some consistency
118

118

00:06:17.234  -->  00:06:19.151
throughout our webpage.
119

119

00:06:20.619  -->  00:06:24.786
So now we have the image here and we have the title.
120

120

00:06:26.280  -->  00:06:31.134
And I guess the best idea is to put each of these icons
121

121

00:06:31.134  -->  00:06:32.892
together with the text
122

122

00:06:32.892  -->  00:06:34.044
inside
123

123

00:06:34.044  -->  00:06:35.217
a
124

124

00:06:35.217  -->  00:06:38.071
container, so a div element.
125

125

00:06:38.071  -->  00:06:39.988
And we can call them...
126

126

00:06:41.558  -->  00:06:42.391
city
127

127

00:06:44.129  -->  00:06:44.962
future.
128

128

00:06:49.574  -->  00:06:51.324
Don't need this here.
129

129

00:06:54.318  -->  00:06:55.151
Great.
130

130

00:06:58.103  -->  00:07:01.287
So we have the image, the title, and now we will have
131

131

00:07:01.287  -->  00:07:02.954
one little container
132

132

00:07:03.970  -->  00:07:06.470
for each of the three details.
133

133

00:07:07.498  -->  00:07:09.331
So we have the eaters,
134

134

00:07:10.558  -->  00:07:11.891
then we have the
135

135

00:07:14.204  -->  00:07:15.287
the top chefs
136

136

00:07:17.129  -->  00:07:19.879
and we have the Twitter username.
137

137

00:07:22.110  -->  00:07:26.239
And now let's just choose an icon for the top chefs
138

138

00:07:26.239  -->  00:07:27.539
and for
139

139

00:07:27.539  -->  00:07:28.956
the Twitter name.
140

140

00:07:31.092  -->  00:07:34.296
So back in the ionicons library here,
141

141

00:07:34.296  -->  00:07:38.483
let's choose a cool icon for the top chefs.
142

142

00:07:38.483  -->  00:07:41.640
Maybe a star would be a good idea.
143

143

00:07:41.640  -->  00:07:46.041
So let's see if we can find something like that.
144

144

00:07:46.041  -->  00:07:48.624
There's really a huge amount of
145

145

00:07:49.465  -->  00:07:51.195
icons here.
146

146

00:07:51.195  -->  00:07:53.028
Okay, let me copy this
147

147

00:07:55.746  -->  00:07:58.163
and then paste it right here.
148

148

00:08:00.041  -->  00:08:02.425
So staring now for the Twitter username,
149

149

00:08:02.425  -->  00:08:06.008
we have a couple of social icons down here,
150

150

00:08:07.034  -->  00:08:09.420
like all kinds of icons that you can imagine:
151

151

00:08:09.420  -->  00:08:11.784
Twitter, Facebook, Googleplus,
152

152

00:08:11.784  -->  00:08:12.617
Dribbble,
153

153

00:08:13.564  -->  00:08:14.755
Instagram,
154

154

00:08:14.755  -->  00:08:19.050
Snapchat, really everything you can imagine.
155

155

00:08:19.050  -->  00:08:22.161
And we will actually use them later,
156

156

00:08:22.161  -->  00:08:25.744
but for now we just need this Twitter icon.
157

157

00:08:27.468  -->  00:08:29.018
Alright,
158

158

00:08:29.018  -->  00:08:33.185
let me just check how this looks like on our website.
159

159

00:08:36.941  -->  00:08:38.295
Okay.
160

160

00:08:38.295  -->  00:08:40.485
So of course the image is way too big now
161

161

00:08:40.485  -->  00:08:43.060
and that's because we didn't format it yet,
162

162

00:08:43.060  -->  00:08:46.239
but our H3 title already looks good
163

163

00:08:46.239  -->  00:08:48.656
and this H2 title, of course,
164

164

00:08:49.668  -->  00:08:52.106
is also good looking already
165

165

00:08:52.106  -->  00:08:54.190
and the icons are showing up here.
166

166

00:08:54.190  -->  00:08:55.864
So let's continue
167

167

00:08:55.864  -->  00:08:58.447
adding the other three columns.
168

168

00:09:01.369  -->  00:09:03.725
And instead of rewriting all of it,
169

169

00:09:03.725  -->  00:09:06.062
I will just copy it one,
170

170

00:09:06.062  -->  00:09:07.312
two, and three.
171

171

00:09:11.860  -->  00:09:14.027
And, so the second one is,
172

172

00:09:15.608  -->  00:09:16.775
San Francisco.
173

173

00:09:21.024  -->  00:09:22.188
So,
174

174

00:09:22.188  -->  00:09:23.021
Lisbon,
175

175

00:09:24.904  -->  00:09:26.071
San Francisco.
176

176

00:09:31.403  -->  00:09:33.399
Let me look for the image.
177

177

00:09:33.399  -->  00:09:34.232
Lisbon...
178

178

00:09:35.185  -->  00:09:37.852
San Francisco, oh, the last one.
179

179

00:09:39.333  -->  00:09:41.416
Now it's just a matter of
180

180

00:09:43.792  -->  00:09:45.709
changing all the stuff.
181

181

00:09:48.017  -->  00:09:49.434
So, instead of...
182

182

00:09:51.427  -->  00:09:52.770
we have
183

183

00:09:52.770  -->  00:09:54.161
3700
184

184

00:09:54.161  -->  00:09:56.328
and 160, and here it's SF.
185

185

00:09:59.181  -->  00:10:00.848
San Francisco, so...
186

186

00:10:02.205  -->  00:10:03.538
Here we have 160
187

187

00:10:05.269  -->  00:10:06.102
in SF.
188

188

00:10:08.498  -->  00:10:09.435
Yeah, that's right.
189

189

00:10:09.435  -->  00:10:11.685
So the next city is Berlin.
190

190

00:10:13.593  -->  00:10:16.705
San Francisco and, here we go, Berlin.
191

191

00:10:16.705  -->  00:10:17.622
And Berlin.
192

192

00:10:22.173  -->  00:10:23.481
Do we have here?
193

193

00:10:23.481  -->  00:10:25.231
Alright, it's Berlin.
194

194

00:10:30.115  -->  00:10:31.532
And here we have,
195

195

00:10:32.420  -->  00:10:33.253
1300 and
196

196

00:10:34.536  -->  00:10:35.369
110.
197

197

00:10:41.177  -->  00:10:42.010
And
198

198

00:10:42.942  -->  00:10:44.162
Berlin.
199

199

00:10:44.162  -->  00:10:46.329
And the last on is London.
200

200

00:11:02.216  -->  00:11:03.466
And here it is.
201

201

00:11:06.153  -->  00:11:06.986
So,
202

202

00:11:08.504  -->  00:11:09.337
1200
203

203

00:11:11.326  -->  00:11:12.638
50
204

204

00:11:12.638  -->  00:11:13.909
and
205

205

00:11:13.909  -->  00:11:14.742
London.
206

206

00:11:16.278  -->  00:11:17.528
Alright, great.
207

207

00:11:18.669  -->  00:11:19.668
Don't need this.
208

208

00:11:19.668  -->  00:11:22.918
I'll actually leave the comments there.
209

209

00:11:24.741  -->  00:11:25.574
So, right.
210

210

00:11:26.594  -->  00:11:30.261
I think the mark up is here, let's check it.
211

211

00:11:31.203  -->  00:11:34.435
Great, so it's not formatted,
212

212

00:11:34.435  -->  00:11:35.685
as you can see,
213

213

00:11:37.000  -->  00:11:38.643
but the content is here
214

214

00:11:38.643  -->  00:11:42.039
and all we need to do next is to format it.
215

215

00:11:42.039  -->  00:11:43.639
Actually,
216

216

00:11:43.639  -->  00:11:46.107
I want to show you this.
217

217

00:11:46.107  -->  00:11:48.603
Remember in the last section,
218

218

00:11:48.603  -->  00:11:51.186
we defined this gray color here
219

219

00:11:51.186  -->  00:11:55.144
and as I had told you it is a great way of separating
220

220

00:11:55.144  -->  00:11:57.454
sections from one another.
221

221

00:11:57.454  -->  00:11:59.121
Now we can see that.
222

222

00:12:00.003  -->  00:12:03.424
So you come down here and it's beautifully separated
223

223

00:12:03.424  -->  00:12:08.417
just by this color and by this white space of course.
224

224

00:12:08.417  -->  00:12:10.396
So we have lots of white space,
225

225

00:12:10.396  -->  00:12:13.030
which gives our website
226

226

00:12:13.030  -->  00:12:14.363
visual hierarchy
227

227

00:12:15.221  -->  00:12:16.703
and it actually looks designed,
228

228

00:12:16.703  -->  00:12:19.123
but all this white space here and here
229

229

00:12:19.123  -->  00:12:22.815
and between the images and the title,
230

230

00:12:22.815  -->  00:12:25.898
I think it really looks great so far.
231

231

00:12:26.863  -->  00:12:29.691
And, yeah, see you in the next lecture
232

232

00:12:29.691  -->  00:12:31.700
where we will then use
233

233

00:12:31.700  -->  00:12:34.117
CSS to format the thing here.
234

234

00:12:35.380  -->  00:12:37.047
Okay, see you there.
