<v Voiceover>Now it's time to talk about inspiration.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,299  -->  00:00:07,250
Inspiration is absolutely essential,
3

3

00:00:07,250  -->  00:00:09,873
especially for a beginner like you.
4

4

00:00:09,873  -->  00:00:13,352
Believe me, without inspiration you'll have a hard time
5

5

00:00:13,352  -->  00:00:15,269
to even start anything.
6

6

00:00:17,011  -->  00:00:20,130
Of course, you don't have to reinvent website layouts
7

7

00:00:20,130  -->  00:00:24,902
and user interface elements such as buttons or navigations.
8

8

00:00:24,902  -->  00:00:27,601
Instead of that, you should use other websites
9

9

00:00:27,601  -->  00:00:31,475
as inspiration in order to see what other leading designers
10

10

00:00:31,475  -->  00:00:32,808
are doing right.
11

11

00:00:34,096  -->  00:00:37,613
So, here are some steps that you may follow.
12

12

00:00:37,613  -->  00:00:40,497
First, collect a bunch of designs that you like
13

13

00:00:40,497  -->  00:00:43,305
and that you think are well-designed.
14

14

00:00:43,305  -->  00:00:46,083
Then, understand everything about them
15

15

00:00:46,083  -->  00:00:48,505
by answering those questions.
16

16

00:00:48,505  -->  00:00:50,338
Why do they look good?
17

17

00:00:52,080  -->  00:00:54,188
What do these sites have in common?
18

18

00:00:54,188  -->  00:00:57,826
And how were they built in HTML and CSS?
19

19

00:00:57,826  -->  00:01:00,915
Now, in order to analyze the HTML and CSS code,
20

20

00:01:00,915  -->  00:01:03,645
you can use a Google Chrome Developer tools
21

21

00:01:03,645  -->  00:01:05,917
if you are familiar with them.
22

22

00:01:05,917  -->  00:01:09,302
You can actually learn a lot by just doing this.
23

23

00:01:09,302  -->  00:01:12,969
Believe me, this is a very effective method.
24

24

00:01:14,558  -->  00:01:17,798
And next thing I wanna tell you about inspiration
25

25

00:01:17,798  -->  00:01:19,935
is steal like an artist.
26

26

00:01:19,935  -->  00:01:22,183
Yes, you heard that right.
27

27

00:01:22,183  -->  00:01:25,654
So, basically, I want you to make your design similar
28

28

00:01:25,654  -->  00:01:29,451
to webpages you like, at least at first.
29

29

00:01:29,451  -->  00:01:31,729
When you're starting out, don't worry so much
30

30

00:01:31,729  -->  00:01:34,311
about being original.
31

31

00:01:34,311  -->  00:01:37,165
Once you're getting better and better, then originality
32

32

00:01:37,165  -->  00:01:39,667
will come automatically.
33

33

00:01:39,667  -->  00:01:43,024
Of course, you should not literally copy anything,
34

34

00:01:43,024  -->  00:01:45,357
but you get the idea, right?
35

35

00:01:47,285  -->  00:01:49,957
So, where should you actually get inspiration?
36

36

00:01:49,957  -->  00:01:53,981
Don't worry, you will find some great websites in the Ebook,
37

37

00:01:53,981  -->  00:01:56,416
where you can find inspiration.
38

38

00:01:56,416  -->  00:02:00,222
For instance, Dribble is a show-and-tell for designers
39

39

00:02:00,222  -->  00:02:03,320
and it's invite-only, so the quality you'll find there
40

40

00:02:03,320  -->  00:02:05,315
is quite high.
41

41

00:02:05,315  -->  00:02:07,966
Basically, all great designers are there,
42

42

00:02:07,966  -->  00:02:10,942
and you can learn a lot from them.
43

43

00:02:10,942  -->  00:02:13,307
We already saw some inspiration in many
44

44

00:02:13,307  -->  00:02:16,523
of the other lectures, so you can just go back
45

45

00:02:16,523  -->  00:02:20,190
and take a deeper look at those if you want.
