00:00:01,438  -->  00:00:02,638
<v Voiceover>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02,638  -->  00:00:04,798
Let's use some more jQuery.
3

3

00:00:04,798  -->  00:00:05,858
In this lecture,
4

4

00:00:05,858  -->  00:00:09,691
we'll use it to create some scrolling effects.
5

5

00:00:10,838  -->  00:00:13,595
So, there's two things that we need to do.
6

6

00:00:13,595  -->  00:00:15,394
First, we need to define
7

7

00:00:15,394  -->  00:00:17,774
what happens when he hit these buttons,
8

8

00:00:17,774  -->  00:00:20,934
because so far they don't do anything at all.
9

9

00:00:20,934  -->  00:00:23,194
And then what happens when we hit
10

10

00:00:23,194  -->  00:00:26,777
these navigation buttons right here, right?
11

11

00:00:27,914  -->  00:00:32,081
So let's start with the easier ones, which are these two.
12

12

00:00:33,292  -->  00:00:36,272
So this is the main call-to-action button
13

13

00:00:36,272  -->  00:00:40,672
and so we want this to scroll to the most important section,
14

14

00:00:40,672  -->  00:00:43,452
which is the pricing plan section.
15

15

00:00:43,452  -->  00:00:46,119
So this will go all the way down
16

16

00:00:47,388  -->  00:00:49,748
to this section here
17

17

00:00:49,748  -->  00:00:52,848
where a user can then make an action,
18

18

00:00:52,848  -->  00:00:56,568
which is signing up for one of these plans.
19

19

00:00:56,568  -->  00:00:58,306
And the second one, Show Me More,
20

20

00:00:58,306  -->  00:01:00,556
will just scroll down here.
21

21

00:01:02,346  -->  00:01:04,513
So we'll start doing that.
22

22

00:01:05,466  -->  00:01:09,633
And in jQuery that's actually pretty straightforward.
23

23

00:01:10,586  -->  00:01:12,086
Let me just comment my code here
24

24

00:01:12,086  -->  00:01:16,253
so that when I come back later I don't get lost with this.
25

25

00:01:17,626  -->  00:01:18,793
So this is for
26

26

00:01:20,586  -->  00:01:22,419
the sticky navigation.
27

27

00:01:26,766  -->  00:01:27,599
And now
28

28

00:01:32,026  -->  00:01:33,526
scroll on buttons.
29

29

00:01:37,066  -->  00:01:40,446
Alright, and this is actually pretty forward.
30

30

00:01:40,446  -->  00:01:42,866
So first up we need to define some classes
31

31

00:01:42,866  -->  00:01:46,881
for each of those buttons so that we can then select them.
32

32

00:01:46,881  -->  00:01:50,384
And we need a unique class for each of them.
33

33

00:01:50,384  -->  00:01:51,551
And as before,
34

34

00:01:52,458  -->  00:01:56,041
we want to have a name only for the jQuery.
35

35

00:01:57,245  -->  00:01:59,681
So I will call this one
36

36

00:01:59,681  -->  00:02:00,931
scroll-to-plan.
37

37

00:02:05,209  -->  00:02:07,821
Because this way when we look at this class name,
38

38

00:02:07,821  -->  00:02:11,481
we know exactly what should happen.
39

39

00:02:11,481  -->  00:02:12,814
Scroll-to-start.
40

40

00:02:17,541  -->  00:02:19,061
Okay, great.
41

41

00:02:19,061  -->  00:02:20,478
So copy this one.
42

42

00:02:22,861  -->  00:02:26,201
And so, maybe you can already guess what happens now.
43

43

00:02:26,201  -->  00:02:28,034
So I will select this,
44

44

00:02:29,441  -->  00:02:31,424
and then I will say click
45

45

00:02:31,424  -->  00:02:35,591
and this defines what happens when we click on that button.
46

46

00:02:37,821  -->  00:02:41,821
So function of this is actually always the same.
47

47

00:02:44,909  -->  00:02:47,909
So, now this is a little bit strange
48

48

00:02:49,041  -->  00:02:52,791
because in order to make the animated scroll,
49

49

00:02:53,756  -->  00:02:56,423
we need to select HTML and body.
50

50

00:03:02,521  -->  00:03:05,601
And then we use the animate method.
51

51

00:03:05,601  -->  00:03:06,768
And like this,
52

52

00:03:07,941  -->  00:03:08,941
so scrollTop
53

53

00:03:15,781  -->  00:03:20,319
and now we select the section where we would want to go to.
54

54

00:03:20,319  -->  00:03:23,379
Again, all of this is maybe a little bit weird.
55

55

00:03:23,379  -->  00:03:26,859
You don't have to understand exactly what goes on here,
56

56

00:03:26,859  -->  00:03:28,599
just make sure that you understand
57

57

00:03:28,599  -->  00:03:31,349
the basic way that we use jQuery.
58

58

00:03:32,376  -->  00:03:35,459
So now we need to select the section.
59

59

00:03:36,477  -->  00:03:38,657
And the first one is the plans.
60

60

00:03:38,657  -->  00:03:40,324
And as before I will
61

61

00:03:42,837  -->  00:03:43,920
use a special
62

62

00:03:46,137  -->  00:03:47,377
class name,
63

63

00:03:47,377  -->  00:03:48,544
section-plans.
64

64

00:03:52,609  -->  00:03:55,192
And we can just do the same for
65

65

00:03:56,565  -->  00:03:57,732
this one here.
66

66

00:04:00,167  -->  00:04:01,665
And we already have it, okay,
67

67

00:04:01,665  -->  00:04:05,085
so we don't have to define it here.
68

68

00:04:05,085  -->  00:04:06,918
So, let's select that,
69

69

00:04:08,485  -->  00:04:10,228
section-plans.
70

70

00:04:10,228  -->  00:04:11,478
And then offset
71

71

00:04:14,423  -->  00:04:15,256
and top.
72

72

00:04:17,523  -->  00:04:21,163
And the other value we need for the animation is the speed.
73

73

00:04:21,163  -->  00:04:25,330
And we will say 1,000 milliseconds, which is a second.
74

74

00:04:26,823  -->  00:04:31,323
So, again what happens here, we select this class,
75

75

00:04:31,323  -->  00:04:34,683
and when we click on it this happens.
76

76

00:04:34,683  -->  00:04:36,703
So we have an animation,
77

77

00:04:36,703  -->  00:04:39,286
which scrolls to the top of the
78

78

00:04:41,062  -->  00:04:45,229
js--section-plans section with a speed of one second.
79

79

00:04:50,065  -->  00:04:51,736
Here we go.
80

80

00:04:51,736  -->  00:04:54,036
Alright, here we are,
81

81

00:04:54,036  -->  00:04:56,036
and this is cool, right?
82

82

00:04:56,896  -->  00:04:58,676
So it is a nice effect.
83

83

00:04:58,676  -->  00:05:02,256
I'm going to show it to you again.
84

84

00:05:02,256  -->  00:05:04,416
Alright, and now let's do the same thing
85

85

00:05:04,416  -->  00:05:05,916
for the other one.
86

86

00:05:08,396  -->  00:05:10,936
So I'll just duplicate this here.
87

87

00:05:10,936  -->  00:05:12,776
Don't want to write it all over again.
88

88

00:05:12,776  -->  00:05:14,943
So this is scroll-to-start
89

89

00:05:15,976  -->  00:05:18,726
and now this is section-features.
90

90

00:05:25,676  -->  00:05:27,976
Hopefully this works as well, and yeah it does.
91

91

00:05:27,976  -->  00:05:29,816
So here we are.
92

92

00:05:29,816  -->  00:05:31,416
So this was pretty easy.
93

93

00:05:31,416  -->  00:05:34,336
Next up, we need to make sure that
94

94

00:05:34,336  -->  00:05:36,316
each time we click on one of these links,
95

95

00:05:36,316  -->  00:05:40,608
we actually get to the section that we want.
96

96

00:05:40,608  -->  00:05:43,328
Now as I told you before,
97

97

00:05:43,328  -->  00:05:46,474
we many times use JavaScript plugins
98

98

00:05:46,474  -->  00:05:48,294
in order to do some stuff,
99

99

00:05:48,294  -->  00:05:52,174
or you can just Google for some jQuery snippets,
100

100

00:05:52,174  -->  00:05:54,574
which is like code that someone else writes
101

101

00:05:54,574  -->  00:05:58,654
and that you can then use in your website.
102

102

00:05:58,654  -->  00:06:00,354
And we will now do that,
103

103

00:06:00,354  -->  00:06:01,974
'cause we don't always have to write
104

104

00:06:01,974  -->  00:06:04,034
everything from scratch.
105

105

00:06:04,034  -->  00:06:07,701
We can use something that someone else used.
106

106

00:06:09,494  -->  00:06:13,494
So in this case I found this little script here.
107

107

00:06:14,334  -->  00:06:18,814
And we will use that to do exactly what we want
108

108

00:06:18,814  -->  00:06:20,564
with that navigation.
109

109

00:06:22,194  -->  00:06:24,027
So, Navigation scroll.
110

110

00:06:28,414  -->  00:06:31,831
Let me just copy this to this place here.
111

111

00:06:33,574  -->  00:06:36,324
And now how do we make this work?
112

112

00:06:37,714  -->  00:06:41,634
First, we need to go back to our HTML navigation
113

113

00:06:41,634  -->  00:06:44,454
and define some anchors.
114

114

00:06:44,454  -->  00:06:46,574
And anchors are like this.
115

115

00:06:46,574  -->  00:06:51,294
We write this hash symbol, and then we define a name.
116

116

00:06:51,294  -->  00:06:55,211
So food delivery here will be for the features.
117

117

00:06:57,394  -->  00:07:01,312
And then we come here and define an ID
118

118

00:07:01,312  -->  00:07:03,062
with that exact name.
119

119

00:07:04,972  -->  00:07:07,305
And so now this is an anchor
120

120

00:07:08,228  -->  00:07:09,311
to this here.
121

121

00:07:10,408  -->  00:07:14,575
And this should actually already work, so let's check this.
122

122

00:07:17,408  -->  00:07:18,640
Okay, I click here,
123

123

00:07:18,640  -->  00:07:22,284
and yeah, it takes me exactly to the place that I want to.
124

124

00:07:22,284  -->  00:07:23,117
Fantastic.
125

125

00:07:24,484  -->  00:07:28,084
So now let's repeat the same thing for the others as well.
126

126

00:07:28,084  -->  00:07:31,584
Because these two of course, not work yet.
127

127

00:07:34,104  -->  00:07:36,424
So this one will be works,
128

128

00:07:36,424  -->  00:07:38,724
this one will be cities,
129

129

00:07:38,724  -->  00:07:40,974
and this one will be plans.
130

130

00:07:46,564  -->  00:07:51,144
So this is the meals one and this is the works.
131

131

00:07:51,144  -->  00:07:52,678
So ID
132

132

00:07:52,678  -->  00:07:53,928
and just works.
133

133

00:07:55,378  -->  00:07:57,461
Then the same for cities.
134

134

00:07:59,316  -->  00:08:01,816
And now for the plans as well.
135

135

00:08:03,858  -->  00:08:04,691
ID, plans.
136

136

00:08:06,718  -->  00:08:10,801
And I guess now, all navigation is ready to work.
137

137

00:08:12,914  -->  00:08:15,914
So let's start by clicking here, Sign Up.
138

138

00:08:15,914  -->  00:08:18,994
And it takes us exactly to the place we want.
139

139

00:08:18,994  -->  00:08:23,914
And now Cities, and How It Works, and Food Delivery.
140

140

00:08:23,914  -->  00:08:27,081
Okay, fantastic, exactly what we want.
141

141

00:08:28,114  -->  00:08:30,154
And so now you see how useful
142

142

00:08:30,154  -->  00:08:32,434
it actually is that this navigation bar
143

143

00:08:32,434  -->  00:08:35,851
always stays on top of everything, right?
144

144

00:08:37,274  -->  00:08:39,857
So this is really quite useful.
145

145

00:08:40,754  -->  00:08:42,874
We can just click everywhere we want,
146

146

00:08:42,874  -->  00:08:45,791
and it takes us to the exact place.
147

147

00:08:48,114  -->  00:08:51,074
So let's just look at this code
148

148

00:08:51,074  -->  00:08:53,874
so that we can understand what happens here.
149

149

00:08:53,874  -->  00:08:57,354
So basically what this says is to,
150

150

00:08:57,354  -->  00:09:01,521
it selects the link element where the href attribute
151

151

00:09:02,434  -->  00:09:04,684
starts with an hash symbol.
152

152

00:09:06,254  -->  00:09:08,214
Then we click it,
153

153

00:09:08,214  -->  00:09:10,154
and this is not too important there,
154

154

00:09:10,154  -->  00:09:12,404
basically what happens then
155

155

00:09:13,594  -->  00:09:15,511
if that element exists,
156

156

00:09:16,754  -->  00:09:18,504
then we scroll to it.
157

157

00:09:20,614  -->  00:09:22,214
And this is actually
158

158

00:09:22,214  -->  00:09:25,964
the same kind of code we used up here, right.
159

159

00:09:26,974  -->  00:09:30,294
So we select the HTML body, we animate it,
160

160

00:09:30,294  -->  00:09:33,314
and then we scroll to the top of the section,
161

161

00:09:33,314  -->  00:09:35,231
and also in one second.
162

162

00:09:36,734  -->  00:09:38,272
We could of course change this,
163

163

00:09:38,272  -->  00:09:40,774
make the animations faster or slower,
164

164

00:09:40,774  -->  00:09:43,357
but one second is kind of cool.
165

165

00:09:44,234  -->  00:09:47,974
So, now we know how to write some code on ourselves.
166

166

00:09:47,974  -->  00:09:51,574
We know how to use code from someone else.
167

167

00:09:51,574  -->  00:09:54,241
And we even used a small plugin.
168

168

00:09:55,854  -->  00:09:59,079
And so in the next section, we will use one more thing,
169

169

00:09:59,079  -->  00:10:02,114
and this will be animations on scroll.
170

170

00:10:02,114  -->  00:10:05,447
And I'm sure you will like that as well.
