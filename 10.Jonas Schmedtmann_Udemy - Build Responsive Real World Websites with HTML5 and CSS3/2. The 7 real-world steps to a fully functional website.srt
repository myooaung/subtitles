00:00:01,859  -->  00:00:03,230
<v Voiceover>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:03,230  -->  00:00:07,167
We are finally going to start building our killer web page.
3

3

00:00:07,167  -->  00:00:08,583
Great.
4

4

00:00:08,583  -->  00:00:10,534
But before diving right in,
5

5

00:00:10,534  -->  00:00:12,577
you got to have a very clear plan
6

6

00:00:12,577  -->  00:00:15,224
of exactly what we're gonna do.
7

7

00:00:15,224  -->  00:00:17,790
With a good plan, you're already halfway
8

8

00:00:17,790  -->  00:00:19,373
to a great website.
9

9

00:00:20,892  -->  00:00:24,689
Because building a website is not just writing some code,
10

10

00:00:24,689  -->  00:00:26,546
it's much more than that.
11

11

00:00:26,546  -->  00:00:27,939
It's a whole process
12

12

00:00:27,939  -->  00:00:29,565
from complete scratch
13

13

00:00:29,565  -->  00:00:32,607
to a completely functional website.
14

14

00:00:32,607  -->  00:00:35,939
And I'm going to reveal the seven real world steps
15

15

00:00:35,939  -->  00:00:38,865
of that process right now.
16

16

00:00:38,865  -->  00:00:41,535
Every good website in the world needs to follow
17

17

00:00:41,535  -->  00:00:44,334
at least these seven steps.
18

18

00:00:44,334  -->  00:00:47,306
You should definitely take some notes of these.
19

19

00:00:47,306  -->  00:00:48,306
So let's go.
20

20

00:00:50,510  -->  00:00:54,272
Start off by defining the goal of your project.
21

21

00:00:54,272  -->  00:00:57,453
This can be showing your portfolio to the world,
22

22

00:00:57,453  -->  00:01:01,620
selling an e-book, building a blog, or whatever you want.
23

23

00:01:03,119  -->  00:01:05,569
Also define your audience.
24

24

00:01:05,569  -->  00:01:08,936
Ask yourself which is the typically user
25

25

00:01:08,936  -->  00:01:11,186
that will visit my website.
26

26

00:01:12,117  -->  00:01:15,241
This is important because you should always design
27

27

00:01:15,241  -->  00:01:18,241
with your goal and audience in mind.
28

28

00:01:20,791  -->  00:01:23,148
Once your project is defined,
29

29

00:01:23,148  -->  00:01:25,540
plan your content carefully.
30

30

00:01:25,540  -->  00:01:29,707
This includes text, images, videos, icons, et cetera.
31

31

00:01:33,169  -->  00:01:36,420
Remember what I told you about visual hierarchy
32

32

00:01:36,420  -->  00:01:39,067
in the web design section?
33

33

00:01:39,067  -->  00:01:42,132
It plays an important role when you start thinking
34

34

00:01:42,132  -->  00:01:44,291
about what you want on your website
35

35

00:01:44,291  -->  00:01:46,590
and what you don't.
36

36

00:01:46,590  -->  00:01:50,271
Defining the content before actually starting the design
37

37

00:01:50,271  -->  00:01:53,354
is called the content-first approach.
38

38

00:01:54,288  -->  00:01:57,028
It means that you should design for the content,
39

39

00:01:57,028  -->  00:01:58,955
instead of designing a webpage
40

40

00:01:58,955  -->  00:02:01,955
and then filling it with some stuff.
41

41

00:02:03,890  -->  00:02:06,364
Also define the navigation
42

42

00:02:06,364  -->  00:02:09,348
and the site structure in this step.
43

43

00:02:09,348  -->  00:02:12,518
You can draw a side map in this step if we're talking
44

44

00:02:12,518  -->  00:02:14,435
about a bigger project.
45

45

00:02:17,138  -->  00:02:20,203
Now it's time to get inspired
46

46

00:02:20,203  -->  00:02:22,536
and think about your design.
47

47

00:02:23,385  -->  00:02:26,766
Then get the ideas our of your head.
48

48

00:02:26,766  -->  00:02:28,261
And by that I mean
49

49

00:02:28,261  -->  00:02:31,969
sketch your ideas before you start designing.
50

50

00:02:31,969  -->  00:02:35,498
It will help you explore ideas and create a concept
51

51

00:02:35,498  -->  00:02:37,681
of what you want to build.
52

52

00:02:37,681  -->  00:02:40,908
Using pencils and paper is a great way
53

53

00:02:40,908  -->  00:02:44,325
of quickly retaining your valuable ideas.
54

54

00:02:45,297  -->  00:02:48,746
And make as many sketches as you want,
55

55

00:02:48,746  -->  00:02:51,903
but don't spend too much time perfecting anything.
56

56

00:02:51,903  -->  00:02:53,854
Once you have an initial idea
57

57

00:02:53,854  -->  00:02:56,130
you can concentrate on the details
58

58

00:02:56,130  -->  00:02:58,713
when designing in HTML and CSS.
59

59

00:03:00,820  -->  00:03:04,164
I advise you to never ever start designing
60

60

00:03:04,164  -->  00:03:08,088
without having an idea of what you want to build.
61

61

00:03:08,088  -->  00:03:11,653
Getting inspiration is very important in this phase
62

62

00:03:11,653  -->  00:03:14,820
and I already told you how to do that.
63

63

00:03:17,006  -->  00:03:20,965
Now after sketching start to design your website
64

64

00:03:20,965  -->  00:03:23,682
using all the guidelines and tips you've learned
65

65

00:03:23,682  -->  00:03:25,849
in the web design section.
66

66

00:03:26,770  -->  00:03:29,719
You will do that using HTML and CSS
67

67

00:03:29,719  -->  00:03:32,668
which is called designing in the browser.
68

68

00:03:32,668  -->  00:03:35,779
So designing in the browser is basically designing
69

69

00:03:35,779  -->  00:03:39,228
and developing at the same time.
70

70

00:03:39,228  -->  00:03:41,655
There are actually more and more designers
71

71

00:03:41,655  -->  00:03:45,045
leaving traditional design programs such as Photoshop
72

72

00:03:45,045  -->  00:03:47,344
and start designing in the browser
73

73

00:03:47,344  -->  00:03:50,037
such as we are going to do.
74

74

00:03:50,037  -->  00:03:51,675
The biggest reason for this
75

75

00:03:51,675  -->  00:03:55,785
is that you can't design responsive websites in Photoshop.
76

76

00:03:55,785  -->  00:03:58,368
It also saves you tons of time.
77

77

00:03:59,872  -->  00:04:03,680
And in this phase you'll use your sketches, content,
78

78

00:04:03,680  -->  00:04:05,984
and planning decisions you've made in steps
79

79

00:04:05,984  -->  00:04:07,651
one, two, and three.
80

80

00:04:09,859  -->  00:04:12,320
This step is of course the biggest part
81

81

00:04:12,320  -->  00:04:14,131
of building a website.
82

82

00:04:14,131  -->  00:04:15,850
But don't forget,
83

83

00:04:15,850  -->  00:04:20,017
all the other steps are also very, very important.
84

84

00:04:21,783  -->  00:04:25,243
Now before you can launch your beautiful masterpiece
85

85

00:04:25,243  -->  00:04:26,938
for the world to see it,
86

86

00:04:26,938  -->  00:04:29,680
we have to optimize it's performance
87

87

00:04:29,680  -->  00:04:33,325
and for search engines such as Google.
88

88

00:04:33,325  -->  00:04:36,878
You don't want a slow website or one that no one can find.
89

89

00:04:36,878  -->  00:04:37,711
Right?
90

90

00:04:40,833  -->  00:04:45,365
Your optimized website is then finally ready to launch.
91

91

00:04:45,365  -->  00:04:47,873
All you need for this is a web server
92

92

00:04:47,873  -->  00:04:51,960
that will host your website and deliver it to the world.
93

93

00:04:51,960  -->  00:04:55,877
I will later show you a way to do exactly that.
94

94

00:04:56,918  -->  00:05:01,400
But the launch of your website is not the end of the story.
95

95

00:05:01,400  -->  00:05:04,884
Now it's time to monitor your users' behavior
96

96

00:05:04,884  -->  00:05:09,051
and make some changes to your website if necessary.
97

97

00:05:10,109  -->  00:05:13,383
You should also update your content regularly
98

98

00:05:13,383  -->  00:05:17,818
in order to show your users that your website is alive.
99

99

00:05:17,818  -->  00:05:21,985
For instance a blog can be a very great way of doing that.
100

100

00:05:24,688  -->  00:05:28,047
These steps I just showed you are so incredibly important
101

101

00:05:28,047  -->  00:05:30,903
that I also included them in the course e-book
102

102

00:05:30,903  -->  00:05:34,015
so that you always know where to find them.
103

103

00:05:34,015  -->  00:05:36,801
Also in the e-book is the link to a document
104

104

00:05:36,801  -->  00:05:40,668
called The Periodic Table of Web Design Process,
105

105

00:05:40,668  -->  00:05:42,770
if you want an even deeper understanding
106

106

00:05:42,770  -->  00:05:46,717
of the complete web design and development process.
107

107

00:05:46,717  -->  00:05:49,134
So make sure to check it out.
108

108

00:05:50,154  -->  00:05:52,243
Now over the rest of the course
109

109

00:05:52,243  -->  00:05:53,418
we're going to put these
110

110

00:05:53,418  -->  00:05:56,335
seven real world steps into action.
111

111

00:05:57,225  -->  00:05:59,918
After that we will have a fully functional,
112

112

00:05:59,918  -->  00:06:04,074
beautiful designed and developed website on the internet.
113

113

00:06:04,074  -->  00:06:06,324
Excited? So let's start it.
