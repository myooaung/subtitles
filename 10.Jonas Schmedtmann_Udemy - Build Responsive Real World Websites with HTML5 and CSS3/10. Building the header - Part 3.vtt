00:00:01.511  -->  00:00:03.810
<v Voiceover>Welcome back to building the header.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.810  -->  00:00:06.727
This is part three, let's continue.
3

3

00:00:08.477  -->  00:00:11.194
So this already looks very good.
4

4

00:00:11.194  -->  00:00:14.190
Now what's missing here is the logo image here,
5

5

00:00:14.190  -->  00:00:16.326
we want the logo image here and we want
6

6

00:00:16.326  -->  00:00:19.826
some simple navigation to show right here.
7

7

00:00:21.690  -->  00:00:25.033
But first of that, we see that our code has grown
8

8

00:00:25.033  -->  00:00:29.853
a little bit and if we keep adding more and more code,
9

9

00:00:29.853  -->  00:00:34.089
we will at some point get completely lost in here.
10

10

00:00:34.089  -->  00:00:38.089
So let's make a nice code structure here so that
11

11

00:00:39.546  -->  00:00:43.713
we organize everything into logical pieces of code.
12

12

00:00:45.328  -->  00:00:48.726
And for that we will use CSS comments, and comments
13

13

00:00:48.726  -->  00:00:52.893
are like code that will not be seen by the browser.
14

14

00:00:54.685  -->  00:00:57.657
It's like invisible code it's just for us to write something
15

15

00:00:57.657  -->  00:01:01.574
here which will not affect any of our web page.
16

16

00:01:05.552  -->  00:01:08.710
So I will just show you how.
17

17

00:01:08.710  -->  00:01:12.460
Comments in CSS are using / and *.
18

18

00:01:14.422  -->  00:01:16.094
And you see everything down here got gray
19

19

00:01:16.094  -->  00:01:18.532
now because I opened a comment.
20

20

00:01:18.532  -->  00:01:23.176
Now I can write something here but then close it again.
21

21

00:01:23.176  -->  00:01:27.936
And now the rest of the CSS code is back to normal.
22

22

00:01:27.936  -->  00:01:30.490
So I usually like to do it like this,
23

23

00:01:30.490  -->  00:01:34.240
I put some lines here to separate some stuff.
24

24

00:01:35.390  -->  00:01:38.942
Then I write what this code section is all about.
25

25

00:01:38.942  -->  00:01:41.275
Here I will say basic setup.
26

26

00:01:44.144  -->  00:01:48.311
Then I close this, but then another line like this here.
27

27

00:01:51.435  -->  00:01:52.268
Alright.
28

28

00:01:54.337  -->  00:01:56.334
I will copy this so that we can put
29

29

00:01:56.334  -->  00:01:58.417
it in our styles as well.
30

30

00:02:01.373  -->  00:02:03.623
So down here I can say like
31

31

00:02:08.919  -->  00:02:12.086
these are reusable components and this
32

32

00:02:14.562  -->  00:02:18.729
is because we will use those all over the website.
33

33

00:02:20.947  -->  00:02:23.896
But then we have things like this one
34

34

00:02:23.896  -->  00:02:27.146
which should go into a different place.
35

35

00:02:28.749  -->  00:02:32.416
Let me just cut them and put them down here.
36

36

00:02:38.223  -->  00:02:41.451
So I will put one of the sections for each of
37

37

00:02:41.451  -->  00:02:44.957
the sections that we will build on our website.
38

38

00:02:44.957  -->  00:02:47.116
So when we later browse our code,
39

39

00:02:47.116  -->  00:02:51.203
we know exactly where to look like for different stuff.
40

40

00:02:51.203  -->  00:02:52.120
So, header.
41

41

00:02:55.963  -->  00:02:59.237
So all the code for our header goes here.
42

42

00:02:59.237  -->  00:03:01.954
Now the buttons that we are going to reuse may be in
43

43

00:03:01.954  -->  00:03:05.390
different places can stay right here.
44

44

00:03:05.390  -->  00:03:08.890
Now we'll just say that these are buttons.
45

45

00:03:17.209  -->  00:03:20.306
Those are buttons and these are headings.
46

46

00:03:20.306  -->  00:03:22.477
Because you know we will maybe
47

47

00:03:22.477  -->  00:03:24.894
use some of them again later.
48

48

00:03:27.728  -->  00:03:28.561
Headings.
49

49

00:03:29.771  -->  00:03:33.440
And we can keep adding more comments
50

50

00:03:33.440  -->  00:03:35.940
like that later down the road.
51

51

00:03:37.921  -->  00:03:42.008
So everything is nicely separated and then we know exactly
52

52

00:03:42.008  -->  00:03:44.591
where to look for our CSS code.
53

53

00:03:46.792  -->  00:03:49.903
So we already learned a lot of stuff in this lecture
54

54

00:03:49.903  -->  00:03:53.618
but we will go even further because we will now
55

55

00:03:53.618  -->  00:03:57.785
put a logo and a navigation bar on top of this page.
56

56

00:04:01.490  -->  00:04:05.135
So we formatted this, everything inside of this content,
57

57

00:04:05.135  -->  00:04:07.802
and now let's add a nav element,
58

58

00:04:11.103  -->  00:04:14.770
where the navigation and the button will go.
59

59

00:04:16.745  -->  00:04:19.532
And now to center everything inside of that
60

60

00:04:19.532  -->  00:04:21.865
navigation I will use a row.
61

61

00:04:24.036  -->  00:04:28.203
Do you remember we said that row will always be centered.
62

62

00:04:30.375  -->  00:04:32.208
So this will be a row.
63

63

00:04:33.608  -->  00:04:34.691
Yes, alright.
64

64

00:04:36.242  -->  00:04:40.409
Now we want the logo to be here and for that let me just
65

65

00:04:42.321  -->  00:04:45.404
first put the logo inside our folder.
66

66

00:04:47.012  -->  00:04:50.429
So I will go back to our contents folder,
67

67

00:04:51.331  -->  00:04:54.233
and this is the content Omni Foot provided us.
68

68

00:04:54.233  -->  00:04:58.088
And actually most of these are images,
69

69

00:04:58.088  -->  00:05:02.088
so I will just put all of them, we'll copy them,
70

70

00:05:04.775  -->  00:05:07.942
and put all of them inside our images.
71

71

00:05:09.721  -->  00:05:12.304
Now I'll paste them here, okay.
72

72

00:05:13.947  -->  00:05:18.114
Except for maybe the text, I will delete the text here.
73

73

00:05:23.305  -->  00:05:24.888
And alright, great.
74

74

00:05:27.159  -->  00:05:28.599
So we want the white logo.
75

75

00:05:28.599  -->  00:05:33.521
They actually gave us two logos a black one and a white one.
76

76

00:05:33.521  -->  00:05:36.726
And we want the white logo here because the background
77

77

00:05:36.726  -->  00:05:39.966
is so dark that the best thing to do
78

78

00:05:39.966  -->  00:05:42.466
is to use the white logo here.
79

79

00:05:43.518  -->  00:05:45.678
Now the best way to put an image,
80

80

00:05:45.678  -->  00:05:48.046
you probably remember how to do that.
81

81

00:05:48.046  -->  00:05:51.296
It's image, then source, and we already
82

82

00:05:52.156  -->  00:05:55.198
know how it is, where it is right?
83

83

00:05:55.198  -->  00:05:58.281
So we go to resources, image, and now
84

84

00:05:59.401  -->  00:06:02.151
it should be down here somewhere.
85

85

00:06:03.023  -->  00:06:04.440
It is logo white.
86

86

00:06:05.693  -->  00:06:09.176
Alright, and now the alternative text,
87

87

00:06:09.176  -->  00:06:12.593
which we will say is just Omni Foot logo.
88

88

00:06:15.608  -->  00:06:17.419
And of course we have to give it a class
89

89

00:06:17.419  -->  00:06:19.811
so that we can format it.
90

90

00:06:19.811  -->  00:06:23.619
The logo should be just right for this.
91

91

00:06:23.619  -->  00:06:24.452
Alright.
92

92

00:06:25.291  -->  00:06:28.310
And now for the navigation.
93

93

00:06:28.310  -->  00:06:31.491
Now the navigation is usually done
94

94

00:06:31.491  -->  00:06:34.241
using a so called unordered list.
95

95

00:06:35.183  -->  00:06:39.246
Unordered lists is just like some bullet points
96

96

00:06:39.246  -->  00:06:41.475
where each bullet point will be
97

97

00:06:41.475  -->  00:06:44.680
an element of the navigation.
98

98

00:06:44.680  -->  00:06:46.955
So how do we do that?
99

99

00:06:46.955  -->  00:06:49.455
Ul stands for an ordered list,
100

100

00:06:51.855  -->  00:06:54.522
and let's just call it main nav.
101

101

00:06:58.635  -->  00:07:00.887
And now for each of the elements inside
102

102

00:07:00.887  -->  00:07:03.387
of an ordered list, we say le.
103

103

00:07:06.855  -->  00:07:09.355
Which means like list element.
104

104

00:07:11.475  -->  00:07:15.678
And now each of the list elements will be a link
105

105

00:07:15.678  -->  00:07:18.302
because that's what a navigation is all about, right?
106

106

00:07:18.302  -->  00:07:22.133
Navigation is like a collection of links.
107

107

00:07:22.133  -->  00:07:25.431
So let's see what Omni Foot had in mind
108

108

00:07:25.431  -->  00:07:28.496
for this navigation, what they want there.
109

109

00:07:28.496  -->  00:07:32.663
So they want, let me just copy this so it's easier.
110

110

00:07:35.671  -->  00:07:39.338
Just down here, I will delete it after this.
111

111

00:07:42.520  -->  00:07:44.590
So these will be links.
112

112

00:07:44.590  -->  00:07:46.257
So, a element, hrev,
113

113

00:07:50.335  -->  00:07:54.418
hrev will be again it will point nowhere for now.
114

114

00:07:55.699  -->  00:07:57.975
So it will be like an empty link
115

115

00:07:57.975  -->  00:08:00.854
so I'll use the hash sign again.
116

116

00:08:00.854  -->  00:08:03.521
And this is here, food delivery.
117

117

00:08:06.195  -->  00:08:07.028
Alright?
118

118

00:08:08.006  -->  00:08:12.279
And as before I will just duplicate this with command d.
119

119

00:08:12.279  -->  00:08:16.458
We have four, so duplicate it three times.
120

120

00:08:16.458  -->  00:08:18.791
The next one is how it works
121

121

00:08:21.804  -->  00:08:24.137
and our cities, and sign up.
122

122

00:08:32.652  -->  00:08:33.485
Alright.
123

123

00:08:36.623  -->  00:08:37.456
Let's see.
124

124

00:08:38.875  -->  00:08:43.148
Now the image is huge, it's way too big so
125

125

00:08:43.148  -->  00:08:45.261
let's start by formatting the image.
126

126

00:08:45.261  -->  00:08:48.953
I don't know why the unordered list isn't showing up here
127

127

00:08:48.953  -->  00:08:52.120
but we'll, ah okay it's actually here.
128

128

00:08:54.317  -->  00:08:58.566
So you see these bullet points and you see those blue links.
129

129

00:08:58.566  -->  00:09:00.191
We will just format this in a minute,
130

130

00:09:00.191  -->  00:09:02.358
let's start with the logo.
131

131

00:09:04.162  -->  00:09:06.995
So the class is called logo.
132

132

00:09:06.995  -->  00:09:11.615
So it's in the header so I will put it right here.
133

133

00:09:11.615  -->  00:09:14.615
So logo, so logo I think the height,
134

134

00:09:18.372  -->  00:09:21.437
the optimal height will be 100 pixels
135

135

00:09:21.437  -->  00:09:25.571
and then the width should be determined automatically
136

136

00:09:25.571  -->  00:09:28.321
so as before we'll say auto here.
137

137

00:09:31.051  -->  00:09:35.218
Okay now we want this to be floated all to the left side.
138

138

00:09:37.854  -->  00:09:40.664
So we can use the float property here
139

139

00:09:40.664  -->  00:09:43.831
and say it should be on the left side.
140

140

00:09:45.842  -->  00:09:49.209
Alright then we can actually already do some things
141

141

00:09:49.209  -->  00:09:51.292
for the main navigation .
142

142

00:09:52.134  -->  00:09:53.467
Main navigation.
143

143

00:09:58.961  -->  00:10:02.961
Just say that it should float to the right side.
144

144

00:10:05.416  -->  00:10:07.529
So this is what it looks like.
145

145

00:10:07.529  -->  00:10:11.696
So the food delivery logo is right here on this side
146

146

00:10:13.357  -->  00:10:15.517
and the navigation is on the right side,
147

147

00:10:15.517  -->  00:10:18.100
just as we specified it before.
148

148

00:10:19.371  -->  00:10:22.552
Now we have to format this navigation,
149

149

00:10:22.552  -->  00:10:24.899
and I will show you how and this is actually
150

150

00:10:24.899  -->  00:10:28.482
the way everyone formats their navigations.
151

151

00:10:29.681  -->  00:10:33.848
So the first thing here is in this unordered list,
152

152

00:10:34.882  -->  00:10:38.063
because main nav is an unordered list, right,
153

153

00:10:38.063  -->  00:10:42.661
is to say that we want to get rid of those bullet points.
154

154

00:10:42.661  -->  00:10:44.828
So we say list style none.
155

155

00:10:48.930  -->  00:10:52.413
Okay and that should do it for now.
156

156

00:10:52.413  -->  00:10:56.580
Now we want to select the li elements inside of this.
157

157

00:10:58.102  -->  00:11:02.269
Let me show you it to you, so we want to select this.
158

158

00:11:03.119  -->  00:11:07.286
And we already learned how to do that before, right?
159

159

00:11:08.249  -->  00:11:11.582
So we say main navigation and we want to
160

160

00:11:12.569  -->  00:11:16.353
select all li elements inside of them.
161

161

00:11:16.353  -->  00:11:17.560
So this is how we do it:
162

162

00:11:17.560  -->  00:11:21.227
main nav and then all li elements inside it.
163

163

00:11:25.014  -->  00:11:29.181
And again we want to change the way they are displayed.
164

164

00:11:31.655  -->  00:11:35.572
So they are now block elements and we want them
165

165

00:11:38.157  -->  00:11:42.324
to be inline blocks so that they can be side by side
166

166

00:11:44.705  -->  00:11:47.259
and we want some margin between them.
167

167

00:11:47.259  -->  00:11:51.009
Let's say we want a left margin of 40 pixels.
168

168

00:11:55.009  -->  00:11:57.433
So each of those blocks will have
169

169

00:11:57.433  -->  00:12:00.683
a margin on the left side of 40 pixels.
170

170

00:12:02.638  -->  00:12:05.221
And this is what it looks like.
171

171

00:12:07.232  -->  00:12:10.649
So the li elements are now nicely aligned
172

172

00:12:11.527  -->  00:12:13.524
such as we want them.
173

173

00:12:13.524  -->  00:12:15.962
And now it's just time to format
174

174

00:12:15.962  -->  00:12:18.795
how the links inside of them look.
175

175

00:12:20.513  -->  00:12:24.680
And in order to do that, we can even go further down
176

176

00:12:26.690  -->  00:12:30.857
and say main nav then we want to select the li elements
177

177

00:12:31.891  -->  00:12:34.974
inside of them and then the a element
178

178

00:12:35.885  -->  00:12:37.968
inside of each of the li.
179

179

00:12:39.368  -->  00:12:40.451
Easy as that.
180

180

00:12:42.271  -->  00:12:46.104
Now we want them to be wide and such as before
181

181

00:12:49.608  -->  00:12:53.811
we want to get rid of that text underline,
182

182

00:12:53.811  -->  00:12:56.394
so we say text decoration none.
183

183

00:13:00.498  -->  00:13:05.305
And I think it will look great if we make them upper case.
184

184

00:13:05.305  -->  00:13:08.972
So text transform again, upper case and then
185

185

00:13:14.732  -->  00:13:18.261
let's specify the font size as well.
186

186

00:13:18.261  -->  00:13:22.011
This shouldn't be too big because as you know
187

187

00:13:24.856  -->  00:13:28.273
our base font size is 20 pixels and let's
188

188

00:13:31.191  -->  00:13:34.024
say you want it to be 18 pixels.
189

189

00:13:34.024  -->  00:13:38.191
But as I said before, we will never use the unit in pixels.
190

190

00:13:41.269  -->  00:13:45.355
We want it to be 18 pixels, but expressed in percentage.
191

191

00:13:45.355  -->  00:13:46.952
So what do we do?
192

192

00:13:46.952  -->  00:13:50.785
We divide that 18 pixels we want by this base,
193

193

00:13:54.819  -->  00:13:56.635
base text size.
194

194

00:13:56.635  -->  00:14:00.802
So 18 divided by 20 which is 0,9 which is 90 percent.
195

195

00:14:02.510  -->  00:14:06.677
So we will just say we want the font size to 90 percent
196

196

00:14:08.338  -->  00:14:11.255
and then it will give us 18 pixels.
197

197

00:14:13.632  -->  00:14:15.536
And that's how it looks like.
198

198

00:14:15.536  -->  00:14:16.786
Not bad, right?
199

199

00:14:19.995  -->  00:14:23.230
Now we probably want some distance between the logo
200

200

00:14:23.230  -->  00:14:25.848
at the top and then center
201

201

00:14:25.848  -->  00:14:28.265
this navigation so that here,
202

202

00:14:30.167  -->  00:14:33.250
like here on the middle of this logo.
203

203

00:14:34.672  -->  00:14:38.410
And in order to do that, we will specify
204

204

00:14:38.410  -->  00:14:41.077
a margin on the top of the logo.
205

205

00:14:42.450  -->  00:14:46.283
So margin top, let's say 20 pixels and margin,
206

206

00:14:50.995  -->  00:14:52.528
no it's right here.
207

207

00:14:52.528  -->  00:14:56.195
So the main nav should have a margin top of,
208

208

00:14:58.588  -->  00:15:01.338
I don't know, 60 pixels probably.
209

209

00:15:06.030  -->  00:15:09.749
And yeah this looks pretty great, right?
210

210

00:15:09.749  -->  00:15:12.025
This may be a little bit too much,
211

211

00:15:12.025  -->  00:15:16.192
I will say 55 pixels but it doesn't really matter.
212

212

00:15:20.222  -->  00:15:21.889
Okay, now very good.
213

213

00:15:23.101  -->  00:15:27.268
One thing is we want some hover effect right here.
214

214

00:15:29.602  -->  00:15:31.135
And one beautiful thing that we can
215

215

00:15:31.135  -->  00:15:35.135
do that you probably saw on many websites is to,
216

216

00:15:37.520  -->  00:15:41.687
once we hover an element, give it some border, okay?
217

217

00:15:43.697  -->  00:15:47.364
A two pixel border I think would look great.
218

218

00:15:49.200  -->  00:15:52.172
So one thing that we did not yet do here
219

219

00:15:52.172  -->  00:15:54.672
is to say that this is a link.
220

220

00:15:57.528  -->  00:16:00.695
And after that say that a visited link
221

221

00:16:02.180  -->  00:16:04.597
should look exactly the same.
222

222

00:16:05.477  -->  00:16:09.644
So this is exactly what we did with the buttons here before.
223

223

00:16:12.884  -->  00:16:16.321
So this is the link at the visited state
224

224

00:16:16.321  -->  00:16:20.071
and now we want some hover and active states.
225

225

00:16:23.357  -->  00:16:25.357
Hover and active states.
226

226

00:16:32.134  -->  00:16:36.301
And what we want here is a nice border at the bottom.
227

227

00:16:44.998  -->  00:16:48.831
With let's say two pixels, again a solid line,
228

228

00:16:49.692  -->  00:16:53.859
and the color can be our orange color that would look great.
229

229

00:16:55.552  -->  00:16:59.219
So our orange color is this one here, right?
230

230

00:17:00.173  -->  00:17:03.377
And we will probably use this a lot of time,
231

231

00:17:03.377  -->  00:17:07.377
so I will just make a comment here and paste it.
232

232

00:17:13.571  -->  00:17:15.196
Orange color.
233

233

00:17:15.196  -->  00:17:19.363
So each time we want it we know where to find it, okay?
234

234

00:17:22.952  -->  00:17:25.369
So we want this to be orange.
235

235

00:17:26.388  -->  00:17:30.568
Now in order for this to happen we need this border
236

236

00:17:30.568  -->  00:17:33.651
to exist before we actually hover it,
237

237

00:17:35.514  -->  00:17:39.681
but since we don't want to see it we make it transparent.
238

238

00:17:40.599  -->  00:17:43.084
So now I think we can do in CSS
239

239

00:17:43.084  -->  00:17:46.334
is we can say transparent, transparent.
240

240

00:17:48.912  -->  00:17:53.079
So it will not be visible until we actually hover it.
241

241

00:17:55.715  -->  00:17:58.548
And such as with the buttons,
242

242

00:17:58.548  -->  00:18:01.131
we want a nice transition here.
243

243

00:18:02.263  -->  00:18:06.211
And you know already how to do this so we say transition
244

244

00:18:06.211  -->  00:18:10.181
and then the property we want to emanate.
245

245

00:18:10.181  -->  00:18:13.200
So it's border bottom in this case,
246

246

00:18:13.200  -->  00:18:17.117
and again 0.2 second interval in between those.
247

247

00:18:19.237  -->  00:18:21.320
So how does it look like?
248

248

00:18:22.906  -->  00:18:24.656
Okay it works, right?
249

249

00:18:25.785  -->  00:18:28.711
Now let's, it doesn't look so good because we want
250

250

00:18:28.711  -->  00:18:32.878
some more space between the line and the text, right?
251

251

00:18:34.932  -->  00:18:37.764
And there's an easy way to do this and maybe
252

252

00:18:37.764  -->  00:18:40.969
you can guess already how we will do this.
253

253

00:18:40.969  -->  00:18:44.302
It is to specify a padding for the link.
254

254

00:18:45.427  -->  00:18:49.462
And padding is an inside space, so a space inside
255

255

00:18:49.462  -->  00:18:54.219
of the box which goes between the content and the border.
256

256

00:18:54.219  -->  00:18:58.386
So we'll add some padding to the bottom and also to the top.
257

257

00:19:02.197  -->  00:19:05.530
And we can make it for example 8 pixels.
258

258

00:19:07.703  -->  00:19:08.953
We put it here.
259

259

00:19:09.793  -->  00:19:14.135
So want a padding top and bottom of 8 pixels,
260

260

00:19:14.135  -->  00:19:17.968
so we put it here and left and right 0 pixels.
261

261

00:19:20.195  -->  00:19:23.678
And I think now everything is perfect.
262

262

00:19:23.678  -->  00:19:24.845
Just check it.
263

263

00:19:28.438  -->  00:19:31.830
Alright, this looks absolutely fantastic,
264

264

00:19:31.830  -->  00:19:33.413
don't you think so?
265

265

00:19:34.754  -->  00:19:38.421
So the first section is completely designed.
266

266

00:19:39.514  -->  00:19:42.649
We have learned a lot of stuff in this section.
267

267

00:19:42.649  -->  00:19:45.296
Congratulations, you just built the first
268

268

00:19:45.296  -->  00:19:48.942
section of your real world website!
269

269

00:19:48.942  -->  00:19:50.497
Isn't that great?
270

270

00:19:50.497  -->  00:19:55.188
This was a lot of stuff to absorb and if you didn't
271

271

00:19:55.188  -->  00:19:57.372
understand everything right away,
272

272

00:19:57.372  -->  00:20:01.480
don't worry you can always go back if you want.
273

273

00:20:01.480  -->  00:20:04.813
So now come with me to the next section.
