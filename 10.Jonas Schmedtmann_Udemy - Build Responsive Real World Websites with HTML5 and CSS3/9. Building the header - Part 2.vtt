00:00:02.086  -->  00:00:05.890
<v Voiceover>Welcome back to Part 2 of Building the Header.</v>
2

2

00:00:05.890  -->  00:00:08.325
In this video, we'll format the content
3

3

00:00:08.325  -->  00:00:10.256
of the hero text blocks,
4

4

00:00:10.256  -->  00:00:13.781
so this heading and those buttons.
5

5

00:00:13.781  -->  00:00:16.889
Let's start by looking at the main heading.
6

6

00:00:16.889  -->  00:00:20.887
We should probably make it wide, right?
7

7

00:00:20.887  -->  00:00:24.286
So let's go back to the h1 style here,
8

8

00:00:24.286  -->  00:00:28.714
and continue to define how it should look like.
9

9

00:00:28.714  -->  00:00:31.297
So color, I will make it right,
10

10

00:00:34.563  -->  00:00:38.063
and I will specify its font size, as well.
11

11

00:00:40.194  -->  00:00:42.194
Now, the basic font size
12

12

00:00:43.651  -->  00:00:46.484
of our html document is 20 pixels.
13

13

00:00:48.750  -->  00:00:50.879
Now, in responsive web design,
14

14

00:00:50.879  -->  00:00:53.712
we want everything to be relative.
15

15

00:00:55.162  -->  00:00:59.329
So we can say that our font size should be 200%,
16

16

00:01:00.557  -->  00:01:02.929
and then, this means
17

17

00:01:02.929  -->  00:01:04.929
that our heading element
18

18

00:01:06.513  -->  00:01:07.735
will be 40 pixels,
19

19

00:01:07.735  -->  00:01:11.652
which is exactly 200% of 20 pixels, right?
20

20

00:01:12.681  -->  00:01:16.098
So, if we later want to change this size,
21

21

00:01:19.316  -->  00:01:21.149
we can just change the
22

22

00:01:22.128  -->  00:01:23.961
html global font size,
23

23

00:01:25.300  -->  00:01:26.732
let's say to 18,
24

24

00:01:26.732  -->  00:01:30.899
and then this size will automatically decrease as well.
25

25

00:01:31.773  -->  00:01:33.612
And we will use this method
26

26

00:01:33.612  -->  00:01:37.464
for all other elements on the webpage,
27

27

00:01:37.464  -->  00:01:41.131
so it will all be defined relatively to this
28

28

00:01:42.277  -->  00:01:44.526
base size of 20 pixels.
29

29

00:01:44.526  -->  00:01:47.541
Then, by adjusting this, all other elements
30

30

00:01:47.541  -->  00:01:50.624
will automatically adjust their size.
31

31

00:01:53.425  -->  00:01:56.675
And 200% looks good to start with.
32

32

00:01:58.608  -->  00:02:00.108
Or maybe 240%
33

33

00:02:03.344  -->  00:02:06.450
because we really want this to be big.
34

34

00:02:06.450  -->  00:02:10.033
So let's check how it looks like.
35

35

00:02:10.033  -->  00:02:12.079
Okay, much better.
36

36

00:02:12.079  -->  00:02:15.020
Now, you probably remember that I said
37

37

00:02:15.020  -->  00:02:17.189
in the design section,
38

38

00:02:17.189  -->  00:02:19.974
that when we use very big headlines,
39

39

00:02:19.974  -->  00:02:22.891
we should decrease the font weight.
40

40

00:02:24.087  -->  00:02:27.275
And we will do that right now.
41

41

00:02:27.275  -->  00:02:28.775
And we should also
42

42

00:02:29.809  -->  00:02:32.142
maybe set this to upper case
43

43

00:02:33.452  -->  00:02:36.535
because I think it looks much better.
44

44

00:02:37.496  -->  00:02:41.129
So let's go back here and do that.
45

45

00:02:41.129  -->  00:02:45.296
And with this, I can show you many ways to format text.
46

46

00:02:47.757  -->  00:02:50.507
So let's decrease the font weight
47

47

00:02:52.869  -->  00:02:53.702
to 300,
48

48

00:02:58.017  -->  00:03:02.349
'cause usually the h1 elements come with bold formatting,
49

49

00:03:02.349  -->  00:03:04.332
and that's not what we want.
50

50

00:03:04.332  -->  00:03:07.165
And we will make it an upper case.
51

51

00:03:10.076  -->  00:03:14.586
For that, we use the text transform property.
52

52

00:03:14.586  -->  00:03:16.669
So, let's say upper case.
53

53

00:03:18.187  -->  00:03:23.182
And another thing we can do is the letter spacing,
54

54

00:03:23.182  -->  00:03:25.349
so it's not so compressed.
55

55

00:03:26.952  -->  00:03:28.309
And also, a word spacing,
56

56

00:03:28.309  -->  00:03:31.989
so some space between different words.
57

57

00:03:31.989  -->  00:03:35.489
All of this makes a big headline like this
58

58

00:03:36.984  -->  00:03:38.415
look much better.
59

59

00:03:38.415  -->  00:03:42.582
I can go with three pixels here, for example, or maybe four.
60

60

00:03:44.651  -->  00:03:46.984
Let's see how it looks like.
61

61

00:03:48.234  -->  00:03:50.157
Okay, much better now.
62

62

00:03:50.157  -->  00:03:54.286
But now we have this ugly line break here, healthy meals,
63

63

00:03:54.286  -->  00:03:55.532
and we don't want that.
64

64

00:03:55.532  -->  00:03:57.865
So let's just break it here,
65

65

00:03:58.876  -->  00:04:00.244
so that we have goodbye junk food,
66

66

00:04:00.244  -->  00:04:03.214
and then on the next line, hello super healthy meals.
67

67

00:04:03.214  -->  00:04:06.467
Right, this will be much better.
68

68

00:04:06.467  -->  00:04:09.127
So you remember how we do that?
69

69

00:04:09.127  -->  00:04:10.874
Easy as this.
70

70

00:04:10.874  -->  00:04:12.374
Just a br element.
71

71

00:04:18.200  -->  00:04:20.329
Much better now, right?
72

72

00:04:20.329  -->  00:04:23.579
So now let's format these buttons here.
73

73

00:04:27.939  -->  00:04:29.272
First, we should
74

74

00:04:31.247  -->  00:04:33.997
attribute some class to this one.
75

75

00:04:35.457  -->  00:04:38.040
And I usually call them button,
76

76

00:04:39.346  -->  00:04:41.925
and now we will have two kinds of buttons.
77

77

00:04:41.925  -->  00:04:44.833
The first one will be a orange button
78

78

00:04:44.833  -->  00:04:47.123
with a full orange color,
79

79

00:04:47.123  -->  00:04:51.088
and the other one will be a so-called ghost button,
80

80

00:04:51.088  -->  00:04:53.755
which will have just an outline,
81

81

00:04:56.041  -->  00:04:57.343
an orange outline,
82

82

00:04:57.343  -->  00:05:00.985
and then be transparent in the inside.
83

83

00:05:00.985  -->  00:05:03.152
And what I'll do now is to
84

84

00:05:05.604  -->  00:05:09.021
create a class for each of those buttons.
85

85

00:05:10.112  -->  00:05:11.148
Let me just show you.
86

86

00:05:11.148  -->  00:05:13.648
Button one will be called full
87

87

00:05:17.707  -->  00:05:19.124
and button ghost.
88

88

00:05:21.320  -->  00:05:23.987
So I will put the common styles,
89

89

00:05:24.966  -->  00:05:29.548
like the font size and the font color and the button size,
90

90

00:05:29.548  -->  00:05:33.213
I will put these inside this button class,
91

91

00:05:33.213  -->  00:05:36.327
and then I will create a button full class,
92

92

00:05:36.327  -->  00:05:40.014
which is specifically designed for the full button,
93

93

00:05:40.014  -->  00:05:42.347
and a button ghost class,
94

94

00:05:42.347  -->  00:05:46.514
which will be specifically designed for the ghost button.
95

95

00:05:48.251  -->  00:05:49.084
All right.
96

96

00:05:51.276  -->  00:05:55.026
So let's go back to the style file down here.
97

97

00:05:58.106  -->  00:05:58.939
So button.
98

98

00:06:02.943  -->  00:06:05.264
Now, in the lecture about the box model,
99

99

00:06:05.264  -->  00:06:07.024
I told you that there were
100

100

00:06:07.024  -->  00:06:10.524
block elements and inline elements, right?
101

101

00:06:11.563  -->  00:06:15.730
Now there is also a mix between those two elements,
102

102

00:06:16.676  -->  00:06:18.805
which is called the inline block,
103

103

00:06:18.805  -->  00:06:23.170
and the inline block is just like an inline element,
104

104

00:06:23.170  -->  00:06:26.253
but that can have heading and margin.
105

105

00:06:29.220  -->  00:06:31.303
So the difference is that
106

106

00:06:32.529  -->  00:06:35.556
it doesn't force a line break,
107

107

00:06:35.556  -->  00:06:40.427
but you can attribute it some heading and some margin
108

108

00:06:40.427  -->  00:06:43.010
unlike a normal inline element.
109

109

00:06:44.600  -->  00:06:46.100
And so, a normal a
110

110

00:06:48.973  -->  00:06:50.390
element like this
111

111

00:06:52.776  -->  00:06:54.533
is an inline element,
112

112

00:06:54.533  -->  00:06:57.561
but we want it be an inline block.
113

113

00:06:57.561  -->  00:07:00.674
So we can change that by using display,
114

114

00:07:00.674  -->  00:07:02.841
and then say inline block.
115

115

00:07:06.441  -->  00:07:07.691
And now, we can
116

116

00:07:10.407  -->  00:07:12.157
give it some heading.
117

117

00:07:15.113  -->  00:07:17.613
And, let's say we want the top
118

118

00:07:19.416  -->  00:07:20.916
to have 10 pixels,
119

119

00:07:22.528  -->  00:07:26.336
and on the right and the left sides, 30 pixels.
120

120

00:07:26.336  -->  00:07:30.169
Now, do you remember if we just put 30 and 10,
121

121

00:07:31.537  -->  00:07:33.153
then this will mean that we have
122

122

00:07:33.153  -->  00:07:34.820
10 pixels of heading
123

123

00:07:35.895  -->  00:07:37.804
on top and bottom
124

124

00:07:37.804  -->  00:07:40.721
and 30 pixels left and right, okay?
125

125

00:07:43.858  -->  00:07:46.715
Now another thing is we also want
126

126

00:07:46.715  -->  00:07:47.965
the font weight
127

127

00:07:49.111  -->  00:07:50.361
to be 300 here.
128

128

00:07:53.574  -->  00:07:54.907
So let me check.
129

129

00:07:57.087  -->  00:08:00.816
All right, so you see, we have some heading here now,
130

130

00:08:00.816  -->  00:08:02.316
and it looks good.
131

131

00:08:05.866  -->  00:08:09.377
We also have this text underline here
132

132

00:08:09.377  -->  00:08:12.210
that we need to get rid of because
133

133

00:08:13.685  -->  00:08:16.272
it's kind of ugly, you know.
134

134

00:08:16.272  -->  00:08:18.439
So we use text decoration,
135

135

00:08:19.961  -->  00:08:21.878
and we want none of it.
136

136

00:08:24.565  -->  00:08:28.398
Very well, so this is the common button style.
137

137

00:08:29.796  -->  00:08:32.497
So both buttons have this in common.
138

138

00:08:32.497  -->  00:08:34.914
And now let's start with the,
139

139

00:08:36.509  -->  00:08:38.342
sorry, now let's start
140

140

00:08:39.492  -->  00:08:41.242
with the full button.
141

141

00:08:43.985  -->  00:08:46.402
And now let's choose a color.
142

142

00:08:47.594  -->  00:08:51.761
As I told you before we will use the Flat UI tool.
143

143

00:08:52.914  -->  00:08:53.831
Right here.
144

144

00:08:55.041  -->  00:08:56.291
Flat UI colors.
145

145

00:09:00.342  -->  00:09:02.652
Okay, that's the one we want.
146

146

00:09:02.652  -->  00:09:05.485
So we have some oranges down here,
147

147

00:09:06.979  -->  00:09:08.979
and to me, it looks like
148

148

00:09:10.134  -->  00:09:13.277
this one is the best to use in this case.
149

149

00:09:13.277  -->  00:09:15.277
So I'll just click here.
150

150

00:09:19.659  -->  00:09:22.159
And now the color is selected.
151

151

00:09:24.323  -->  00:09:25.672
So I will say that we want
152

152

00:09:25.672  -->  00:09:29.839
the background color of this button to be this color.
153

153

00:09:32.353  -->  00:09:35.250
Here we see, it's a nice orange,
154

154

00:09:35.250  -->  00:09:36.083
and
155

155

00:09:37.411  -->  00:09:39.311
let me go back here.
156

156

00:09:39.311  -->  00:09:41.026
And here it is.
157

157

00:09:41.026  -->  00:09:43.526
Now it's a nice orange button.
158

158

00:09:44.621  -->  00:09:47.901
Very well, now, we maybe want some
159

159

00:09:47.901  -->  00:09:49.967
border-radius here, right?
160

160

00:09:49.967  -->  00:09:52.217
So we want this to be round
161

161

00:09:53.113  -->  00:09:54.918
on both sides.
162

162

00:09:54.918  -->  00:09:58.085
So we can just put a ridiculously high
163

163

00:10:00.767  -->  00:10:02.350
border-radius here.
164

164

00:10:06.210  -->  00:10:08.793
Like, I don't know, 200 pixels.
165

165

00:10:09.849  -->  00:10:13.574
Very well, now, the text should probably be white
166

166

00:10:13.574  -->  00:10:15.491
for this button, right?
167

167

00:10:18.282  -->  00:10:21.144
Actually, for both of the buttons,
168

168

00:10:21.144  -->  00:10:22.894
so put it right here,
169

169

00:10:24.235  -->  00:10:25.818
color FFF is white.
170

170

00:10:30.629  -->  00:10:31.712
So very well.
171

171

00:10:33.943  -->  00:10:36.943
Now, the style for the ghost button.
172

172

00:10:40.082  -->  00:10:42.749
We want the border to be orange,
173

173

00:10:43.933  -->  00:10:47.305
so we did this before, at this border,
174

174

00:10:47.305  -->  00:10:51.472
we want it to be one pixel, solid line, and then the color.
175

175

00:10:53.059  -->  00:10:55.726
And we will use this color here.
176

176

00:10:59.196  -->  00:11:02.113
Now you see this button is slightly
177

177

00:11:03.456  -->  00:11:05.330
bigger than this one.
178

178

00:11:05.330  -->  00:11:06.557
And there's a reason for that.
179

179

00:11:06.557  -->  00:11:08.686
If you remember from the box model,
180

180

00:11:08.686  -->  00:11:11.853
the height and the width of an element
181

181

00:11:12.893  -->  00:11:16.941
is the content plus the heading plus the border.
182

182

00:11:16.941  -->  00:11:18.165
So this element is higher
183

183

00:11:18.165  -->  00:11:21.248
because it has that one pixel border.
184

184

00:11:22.509  -->  00:11:26.959
So in order to make these two the same height and width,
185

185

00:11:26.959  -->  00:11:30.876
we just add that border to this button as well.
186

186

00:11:32.030  -->  00:11:35.991
And we also want some distance between this, right?
187

187

00:11:35.991  -->  00:11:38.405
And probably the best way of doing this
188

188

00:11:38.405  -->  00:11:39.572
is to add some
189

189

00:11:41.153  -->  00:11:43.903
button margin to this h1 element.
190

190

00:11:45.721  -->  00:11:48.006
Let's go back, and as I said,
191

191

00:11:48.006  -->  00:11:50.339
we will add this border here
192

192

00:11:51.815  -->  00:11:53.374
so that they look the same
193

193

00:11:53.374  -->  00:11:55.707
and then some margin bottom.
194

194

00:11:57.704  -->  00:12:00.787
So this one is the margin top, right?
195

195

00:12:01.696  -->  00:12:05.863
And here we want margin bottom, like 20 pixels maybe.
196

196

00:12:13.144  -->  00:12:15.484
Now, I actually don't like this white color here so much
197

197

00:12:15.484  -->  00:12:18.591
because of the color of the line.
198

198

00:12:18.591  -->  00:12:21.508
So let's make this text here orange
199

199

00:12:22.911  -->  00:12:24.644
because it looks kind of weird,
200

200

00:12:24.644  -->  00:12:27.561
the orange line and the white text.
201

201

00:12:29.962  -->  00:12:30.962
So this here
202

202

00:12:33.385  -->  00:12:34.710
will go to the full button
203

203

00:12:34.710  -->  00:12:38.210
so that the full button is actually white,
204

204

00:12:39.254  -->  00:12:42.671
and this button down here will be orange,
205

205

00:12:43.963  -->  00:12:45.630
like the line color.
206

206

00:12:47.770  -->  00:12:48.603
All right.
207

207

00:12:49.452  -->  00:12:52.785
So we defined how the buttons look like.
208

208

00:12:54.324  -->  00:12:57.574
Now, buttons or links in general in CSS
209

209

00:12:59.426  -->  00:13:01.884
can have different states,
210

210

00:13:01.884  -->  00:13:04.634
link, visited, active, and hover.
211

211

00:13:07.122  -->  00:13:11.861
Now link is just how the element looks in the normal state.
212

212

00:13:11.861  -->  00:13:13.416
And how do we specify this?
213

213

00:13:13.416  -->  00:13:15.083
We just put it here.
214

214

00:13:16.032  -->  00:13:19.185
This is called pseudo-classes.
215

215

00:13:19.185  -->  00:13:21.726
So I just write link here,
216

216

00:13:21.726  -->  00:13:23.226
so this means the,
217

217

00:13:25.037  -->  00:13:27.870
the a element in its normal state.
218

218

00:13:29.362  -->  00:13:32.029
Then, we have the visited state,
219

219

00:13:33.528  -->  00:13:35.855
which is how the element will look like
220

220

00:13:35.855  -->  00:13:38.022
after it has been visited.
221

221

00:13:39.457  -->  00:13:43.566
And maybe sometimes you notice that some links
222

222

00:13:43.566  -->  00:13:46.219
in some internet websites
223

223

00:13:46.219  -->  00:13:49.583
look different after you have clicked them.
224

224

00:13:49.583  -->  00:13:52.243
Now, we don't want this to happen,
225

225

00:13:52.243  -->  00:13:56.005
so we say that the visited links should look
226

226

00:13:56.005  -->  00:14:00.088
just like the normal links in their normal state.
227

227

00:14:01.504  -->  00:14:03.996
So, we do this here.
228

228

00:14:03.996  -->  00:14:06.079
So we say button visited.
229

229

00:14:10.506  -->  00:14:12.966
So button link and button visited
230

230

00:14:12.966  -->  00:14:14.943
have both the same style,
231

231

00:14:14.943  -->  00:14:18.221
which means they will both look the same.
232

232

00:14:18.221  -->  00:14:21.292
And we have to do the same thing down here.
233

233

00:14:21.292  -->  00:14:22.209
Button link
234

234

00:14:24.854  -->  00:14:26.854
and button full visited.
235

235

00:14:31.768  -->  00:14:34.801
And the same thing down here.
236

236

00:14:34.801  -->  00:14:36.301
Button ghost link.
237

237

00:14:41.546  -->  00:14:42.379
All right.
238

238

00:14:43.816  -->  00:14:47.756
Now there are two different states, which is hover,
239

239

00:14:47.756  -->  00:14:50.869
when we put our mouse over a button
240

240

00:14:50.869  -->  00:14:52.619
and the active state,
241

241

00:14:53.613  -->  00:14:56.530
which is when we click on a button.
242

242

00:14:57.400  -->  00:15:00.400
And we can specify that in CSS here.
243

243

00:15:02.180  -->  00:15:03.959
So we can say what will happen
244

244

00:15:03.959  -->  00:15:06.959
when we put the mouse on the button.
245

245

00:15:09.444  -->  00:15:13.611
And in order to do so, we say button and then hover,
246

246

00:15:14.557  -->  00:15:17.706
and we want the button to look exactly the same
247

247

00:15:17.706  -->  00:15:20.775
when we hover it or when we click on it,
248

248

00:15:20.775  -->  00:15:22.667
so when it's active.
249

249

00:15:22.667  -->  00:15:25.417
So we say button hover and button
250

250

00:15:27.825  -->  00:15:28.658
active.
251

251

00:15:31.220  -->  00:15:33.741
And what we want our buttons to do
252

252

00:15:33.741  -->  00:15:36.408
is to have a darker orange tone,
253

253

00:15:38.650  -->  00:15:42.081
so that we can see some change there, right?
254

254

00:15:42.081  -->  00:15:43.758
Do you remember the tool that we use
255

255

00:15:43.758  -->  00:15:46.425
to get darker shades of a color?
256

256

00:15:47.488  -->  00:15:49.321
It is the 0to255 tool.
257

257

00:15:52.550  -->  00:15:54.383
Let me just copy this.
258

258

00:16:01.093  -->  00:16:03.760
And we'll use this tool, 0to255.
259

259

00:16:10.394  -->  00:16:13.250
So this is how it looks like.
260

260

00:16:13.250  -->  00:16:17.177
And I will paste our orange tone here.
261

261

00:16:17.177  -->  00:16:18.010
And this.
262

262

00:16:20.038  -->  00:16:22.673
Alright, this is our original orange tone
263

263

00:16:22.673  -->  00:16:24.915
that we're using on our website.
264

264

00:16:24.915  -->  00:16:27.498
And now we want a darker shade.
265

265

00:16:29.116  -->  00:16:32.103
And this is very similar, so let's use this.
266

266

00:16:32.103  -->  00:16:35.603
I'll just click here, and now it's copied.
267

267

00:16:39.192  -->  00:16:40.775
So what I do now is
268

268

00:16:42.630  -->  00:16:43.527
that I say that
269

269

00:16:43.527  -->  00:16:46.839
when I put I put my mouse on the button,
270

270

00:16:46.839  -->  00:16:49.506
I want it background color to be
271

271

00:16:51.027  -->  00:16:51.860
this one.
272

272

00:16:53.479  -->  00:16:54.705
All right.
273

273

00:16:54.705  -->  00:16:57.284
Let's just put this code
274

274

00:16:57.284  -->  00:16:58.117
down here.
275

275

00:16:59.570  -->  00:17:02.820
So that we have the normal declarations
276

276

00:17:03.927  -->  00:17:06.993
like link and visited before
277

277

00:17:06.993  -->  00:17:10.596
and then the hover and active states.
278

278

00:17:10.596  -->  00:17:12.929
Here, it's actually visited.
279

279

00:17:13.828  -->  00:17:16.328
And now, let's check this out.
280

280

00:17:18.847  -->  00:17:22.514
Okay, so now our buttons change their color.
281

281

00:17:25.924  -->  00:17:27.985
Now we have some problems here, as you see.
282

282

00:17:27.985  -->  00:17:31.048
First is the text color here,
283

283

00:17:31.048  -->  00:17:33.132
and second is the border color.
284

284

00:17:33.132  -->  00:17:34.643
You see in both,
285

285

00:17:34.643  -->  00:17:37.580
that there is still the lighter orange color
286

286

00:17:37.580  -->  00:17:38.892
still showing here.
287

287

00:17:38.892  -->  00:17:42.187
So we have to change that as well.
288

288

00:17:42.187  -->  00:17:44.020
And in order to do so,
289

289

00:17:45.053  -->  00:17:48.116
we will have to change these classes.
290

290

00:17:48.116  -->  00:17:51.858
We'll just copy these and change the things that I want,
291

291

00:17:51.858  -->  00:17:55.005
so that I don't have to write everything again.
292

292

00:17:55.005  -->  00:17:57.672
So it's hover here and active...
293

293

00:17:59.955  -->  00:18:01.038
and hover and
294

294

00:18:03.144  -->  00:18:04.658
active.
295

295

00:18:04.658  -->  00:18:07.158
So I don't need this and this.
296

296

00:18:08.788  -->  00:18:11.814
So the button full should not only
297

297

00:18:11.814  -->  00:18:14.481
have this background color here,
298

298

00:18:15.403  -->  00:18:18.986
but also its border should have that color.
299

299

00:18:21.400  -->  00:18:25.567
All right, and same thing here for the ghost button.
300

300

00:18:26.779  -->  00:18:28.870
Difference with the ghost button
301

301

00:18:28.870  -->  00:18:31.198
is that we also want the
302

302

00:18:31.198  -->  00:18:33.447
font color to be white,
303

303

00:18:33.447  -->  00:18:34.447
so FFF here.
304

304

00:18:36.715  -->  00:18:39.548
And now it should work as we want.
305

305

00:18:44.534  -->  00:18:47.920
Great, now this looks great, right?
306

306

00:18:47.920  -->  00:18:51.807
Now, one thing, and this is a little more advanced,
307

307

00:18:51.807  -->  00:18:54.974
is we want to have a little transition
308

308

00:18:56.141  -->  00:18:58.474
from one color to the other.
309

309

00:18:59.787  -->  00:19:02.775
So this gets just orange instantaneously,
310

310

00:19:02.775  -->  00:19:05.805
but we want to see a nice transition.
311

311

00:19:05.805  -->  00:19:09.444
And we can actually do this using just CSS,
312

312

00:19:09.444  -->  00:19:11.861
and I will just show you how.
313

313

00:19:13.613  -->  00:19:16.846
So all we need to do here is,
314

314

00:19:16.846  -->  00:19:18.513
in the button class,
315

315

00:19:20.575  -->  00:19:23.325
just add the transition property.
316

316

00:19:24.584  -->  00:19:27.692
And this is actually CSF three already,
317

317

00:19:27.692  -->  00:19:30.192
so what we want to say here is
318

318

00:19:31.715  -->  00:19:33.725
that the background color
319

319

00:19:33.725  -->  00:19:34.808
should change
320

320

00:19:36.221  -->  00:19:38.509
with a transition.
321

321

00:19:38.509  -->  00:19:41.426
We just write it, background-color.
322

322

00:19:44.737  -->  00:19:46.464
Now we'll say,
323

323

00:19:46.464  -->  00:19:47.464
0.2 seconds.
324

324

00:19:50.921  -->  00:19:55.088
So what happens now is that when we hover over a link,
325

325

00:19:57.375  -->  00:19:59.976
over one of these buttons,
326

326

00:19:59.976  -->  00:20:03.745
the background color will not change instantaneously,
327

327

00:20:03.745  -->  00:20:06.495
but over a period of 0.2 seconds.
328

328

00:20:09.679  -->  00:20:12.584
And we want not only the background color to change,
329

329

00:20:12.584  -->  00:20:14.167
but also the border
330

330

00:20:16.792  -->  00:20:18.792
and also the font color.
331

331

00:20:21.697  -->  00:20:25.336
So that is all a nice, smooth transition
332

332

00:20:25.336  -->  00:20:28.228
from one state to the other.
333

333

00:20:28.228  -->  00:20:32.152
So we can specify more than one property here.
334

334

00:20:32.152  -->  00:20:34.731
So we want background color to change.
335

335

00:20:34.731  -->  00:20:36.814
We want border to change.
336

336

00:20:37.674  -->  00:20:39.822
0.2 seconds as well,
337

337

00:20:39.822  -->  00:20:43.989
and we want color to change over a period of 0.2 seconds.
338

338

00:20:47.689  -->  00:20:50.356
Right, let's see how this works.
339

339

00:20:51.551  -->  00:20:52.859
But last thing, we also want
340

340

00:20:52.859  -->  00:20:55.526
some margins between the buttons
341

341

00:20:56.992  -->  00:21:00.409
'cause they are glued together right now.
342

342

00:21:01.929  -->  00:21:05.617
So let me just change here the full button.
343

343

00:21:05.617  -->  00:21:08.367
I will add a margin to the right.
344

344

00:21:11.329  -->  00:21:15.496
So when I say, for example, 15 pixels to the right
345

345

00:21:17.915  -->  00:21:18.748
then
346

346

00:21:22.175  -->  00:21:25.085
the button will show this nice distance.
347

347

00:21:25.085  -->  00:21:26.802
And as you see, the transition works
348

348

00:21:26.802  -->  00:21:29.332
exactly as we planned it, right?
349

349

00:21:29.332  -->  00:21:31.169
In both buttons.
350

350

00:21:31.169  -->  00:21:34.402
So this looks much better than it did before,
351

351

00:21:34.402  -->  00:21:38.413
and yeah, you just learned how to do this.
352

352

00:21:38.413  -->  00:21:39.496
Great, right?
353

353

00:21:40.540  -->  00:21:44.387
And this closes part two of Building the Header.
354

354

00:21:44.387  -->  00:21:47.416
In the next and last part of building the header,
355

355

00:21:47.416  -->  00:21:51.583
we'll just add a simple navigation and the Omnifood logo.
356

356

00:21:52.447  -->  00:21:53.614
See you there.
