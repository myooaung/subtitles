<v Voiceover>Now let's talk a little bit</v>
2

2

00:00:02,696  -->  00:00:06,272
about user experience, because there can be no course
3

3

00:00:06,272  -->  00:00:07,689
about web design without
4

4

00:00:07,689  -->  00:00:11,427
at least mentioning user experience.
5

5

00:00:11,427  -->  00:00:13,284
So far, we focused essentially
6

6

00:00:13,284  -->  00:00:16,953
on visual design of user interfaces.
7

7

00:00:16,953  -->  00:00:19,531
Designing the user interface means to design
8

8

00:00:19,531  -->  00:00:21,528
the presentation of a product,
9

9

00:00:21,528  -->  00:00:25,011
like a web site or a mobile application.
10

10

00:00:25,011  -->  00:00:28,377
It's designing the look and feel of the product.
11

11

00:00:28,377  -->  00:00:31,744
So that is what we've been looking at so far.
12

12

00:00:31,744  -->  00:00:35,065
Now, there's also another type of design which
13

13

00:00:35,065  -->  00:00:39,221
is very important, and that's the user experience design.
14

14

00:00:39,221  -->  00:00:42,124
User experience is the overall experience that
15

15

00:00:42,124  -->  00:00:44,864
the user has with a product.
16

16

00:00:44,864  -->  00:00:48,022
User experience includes the user interface,
17

17

00:00:48,022  -->  00:00:52,189
but also has to understand the whole picture of the product.
18

18

00:00:54,732  -->  00:00:57,658
"'It's not just what it looks like and feels like.
19

19

00:00:57,658  -->  00:01:00,050
"' Design is how it works.'"
20

20

00:01:00,050  -->  00:01:03,648
That is a very well known quote from Steve Jobs
21

21

00:01:03,648  -->  00:01:07,231
about user interface and experience design.
22

22

00:01:08,896  -->  00:01:10,986
Let us picture as a good explanation
23

23

00:01:10,986  -->  00:01:13,772
of the difference between just designing the presentation
24

24

00:01:13,772  -->  00:01:18,184
of a product or designing the whole experience.
25

25

00:01:18,184  -->  00:01:22,248
So the bottle on the left side may be beautifully designed,
26

26

00:01:22,248  -->  00:01:24,988
but it doesn't solve the user's need to get ketchup
27

27

00:01:24,988  -->  00:01:28,726
out of the bottle as quick as possible.
28

28

00:01:28,726  -->  00:01:31,582
So the bottle on the right side tries to solve that problem
29

29

00:01:31,582  -->  00:01:35,460
by designing a pleasant overall user experience.
30

30

00:01:35,460  -->  00:01:39,627
It's also beautiful, but at the same time, it works.
31

31

00:01:41,404  -->  00:01:44,098
We can think of user experience in terms
32

32

00:01:44,098  -->  00:01:47,766
of user's goals and business' goals.
33

33

00:01:47,766  -->  00:01:51,621
A user experience designer needs to align those goals
34

34

00:01:51,621  -->  00:01:56,358
so the business benefits when the user reaches their goal.
35

35

00:01:56,358  -->  00:01:59,005
Imagine for example that you're running a web site
36

36

00:01:59,005  -->  00:02:01,907
where you want to give away for free an ebook
37

37

00:02:01,907  -->  00:02:04,554
in exchange for an email address.
38

38

00:02:04,554  -->  00:02:06,203
The user's goal here is to learn
39

39

00:02:06,203  -->  00:02:09,036
about the specific subject of your book.
40

40

00:02:09,036  -->  00:02:13,308
And your goal is to get the email address of your customers.
41

41

00:02:13,308  -->  00:02:17,209
For example, so you can try to sell them something later.
42

42

00:02:17,209  -->  00:02:19,787
Now you gotta make sure that your design makes
43

43

00:02:19,787  -->  00:02:23,768
the best possible job in achieving both goals.
44

44

00:02:23,768  -->  00:02:26,647
User experience is a huge field and requires
45

45

00:02:26,647  -->  00:02:29,666
a lot of things to study and to analyze.
46

46

00:02:29,666  -->  00:02:32,034
But I felt like I should at least tell you
47

47

00:02:32,034  -->  00:02:35,081
some very basic things about it.
48

48

00:02:35,081  -->  00:02:36,520
I will also give you the link to
49

49

00:02:36,520  -->  00:02:39,794
a great, free user experience crash course,
50

50

00:02:39,794  -->  00:02:41,559
if you're interested.
51

51

00:02:41,559  -->  00:02:45,059
Find the link to that course in the ebook.
