00:00:01.878  -->  00:00:04.119
<v Voiceover>So in the last lecture we wrote a very</v>
2

2

00:00:04.119  -->  00:00:08.286
simple layout using float, clear, margins and pettings.
3

3

00:00:09.841  -->  00:00:14.611
Now it's time to polish our blog post website a little bit.
4

4

00:00:14.611  -->  00:00:16.278
So let's go do that.
5

5

00:00:17.652  -->  00:00:20.474
OK, we just need to finish some things here,
6

6

00:00:20.474  -->  00:00:24.816
like putting some content in this right column,
7

7

00:00:24.816  -->  00:00:27.974
and also make the author section a little more
8

8

00:00:27.974  -->  00:00:30.191
beautiful, you know.
9

9

00:00:30.191  -->  00:00:32.608
And that's what we'll do now.
10

10

00:00:35.915  -->  00:00:40.098
So I'll put some content here in this box,
11

11

00:00:40.098  -->  00:00:43.732
and to do so I go back to the HTML file,
12

12

00:00:43.732  -->  00:00:47.482
into the outer posts, which is empty for now.
13

13

00:00:48.875  -->  00:00:52.958
So let's say we want three outer blog posts here.
14

14

00:00:54.506  -->  00:00:56.506
So I create simply three
15

15

00:00:58.419  -->  00:01:01.836
new diffs and call them maybe just other.
16

16

00:01:08.670  -->  00:01:10.753
And put some name in here
17

17

00:01:11.979  -->  00:01:14.312
diffs first other blog post.
18

18

00:01:22.927  -->  00:01:25.427
Now we'll do this three times.
19

19

00:01:27.107  -->  00:01:31.274
It's just so that that box isn't completely empty.
20

20

00:01:32.713  -->  00:01:34.796
So yet another blog post,
21

21

00:01:40.743  -->  00:01:43.160
and maybe the best post ever.
22

22

00:01:46.385  -->  00:01:47.218
Read this.
23

23

00:01:50.599  -->  00:01:53.266
Now I just want to format those.
24

24

00:01:57.020  -->  00:01:58.596
So Command+E again,
25

25

00:01:58.596  -->  00:01:59.513
a new rule.
26

26

00:02:01.554  -->  00:02:03.471
And let's say we want a
27

27

00:02:05.315  -->  00:02:07.565
margin bottom of 40 pixels,
28

28

00:02:11.120  -->  00:02:15.287
which means a distance between those boxes of 40 pixels.
29

29

00:02:16.856  -->  00:02:19.735
So this is what it looks like.
30

30

00:02:19.735  -->  00:02:23.485
It's not beautiful, but you know, it's there.
31

31

00:02:24.367  -->  00:02:28.534
And the cool thing is we know how to put it there.
32

32

00:02:30.509  -->  00:02:33.092
So let's just close this again,
33

33

00:02:34.062  -->  00:02:38.404
and let's talk about the author box down here.
34

34

00:02:38.404  -->  00:02:42.154
Now I want to show you a new kind of selector
35

35

00:02:43.361  -->  00:02:47.444
because we want to change this author image here.
36

36

00:02:49.491  -->  00:02:52.789
But you know, I don't feel like creating a new class
37

37

00:02:52.789  -->  00:02:54.456
just for this image.
38

38

00:02:56.353  -->  00:03:00.742
And if I format all the image at the same time,
39

39

00:03:00.742  -->  00:03:04.159
then the outer image, like this one here,
40

40

00:03:05.316  -->  00:03:07.149
will also be affected.
41

41

00:03:08.323  -->  00:03:12.259
So there is a way to actually just select
42

42

00:03:12.259  -->  00:03:15.759
this image without giving it a class name.
43

43

00:03:17.332  -->  00:03:21.249
And that's what I'm gonna do here in this file.
44

44

00:03:25.459  -->  00:03:29.209
So I write author box because this is the box
45

45

00:03:31.659  -->  00:03:33.909
where this image is inside.
46

46

00:03:35.364  -->  00:03:38.531
Author box, and then I just write img.
47

47

00:03:42.388  -->  00:03:46.579
And what this does is to select not all the images
48

48

00:03:46.579  -->  00:03:50.492
on the entire website, but only the images inside
49

49

00:03:50.492  -->  00:03:51.992
of the author box.
50

50

00:03:53.255  -->  00:03:55.392
So I don't need to make a whole new class
51

51

00:03:55.392  -->  00:03:57.162
just for that image.
52

52

00:03:57.162  -->  00:03:59.079
It's a much easier way.
53

53

00:04:02.398  -->  00:04:06.555
So and what I want now is to maybe make it
54

54

00:04:06.555  -->  00:04:10.388
a little smaller, so I'll say hide 100 pixels.
55

55

00:04:14.368  -->  00:04:16.829
And since it's a square,
56

56

00:04:16.829  -->  00:04:19.412
can make width also 100 pixels.
57

57

00:04:25.955  -->  00:04:27.395
Here it is.
58

58

00:04:27.395  -->  00:04:29.844
Now let's make it round.
59

59

00:04:29.844  -->  00:04:31.946
You probably have seen those round images
60

60

00:04:31.946  -->  00:04:33.919
all over the internet.
61

61

00:04:33.919  -->  00:04:35.858
Now I'll just show you how to do that,
62

62

00:04:35.858  -->  00:04:37.948
and it's really easy.
63

63

00:04:37.948  -->  00:04:41.448
We just have to specify the border radius.
64

64

00:04:42.824  -->  00:04:43.991
Border radius.
65

65

00:04:45.912  -->  00:04:49.412
And if we say we want this to be 50%,
66

66

00:04:53.714  -->  00:04:55.881
then this is what happens.
67

67

00:04:58.602  -->  00:05:00.519
Image is just a circle.
68

68

00:05:01.725  -->  00:05:04.605
Now another thing that we should probably do is
69

69

00:05:04.605  -->  00:05:08.587
to put this text here right beside this image.
70

70

00:05:08.587  -->  00:05:11.587
You know, this doesn't look so good.
71

71

00:05:12.720  -->  00:05:16.934
And to do that we will again use the float property.
72

72

00:05:16.934  -->  00:05:21.311
So we say these two elements should float left,
73

73

00:05:21.311  -->  00:05:24.353
which will make this element appear first
74

74

00:05:24.353  -->  00:05:25.874
right where it is now,
75

75

00:05:25.874  -->  00:05:29.457
and then this element should go right here.
76

76

00:05:30.866  -->  00:05:33.130
So let's just do that.
77

77

00:05:33.130  -->  00:05:35.630
Say float left for this image,
78

78

00:05:38.947  -->  00:05:41.364
and also for the author text,
79

79

00:05:42.476  -->  00:05:45.797
which is this class right here.
80

80

00:05:45.797  -->  00:05:47.380
So float also left.
81

81

00:05:54.957  -->  00:05:56.790
All right, here we go.
82

82

00:05:57.813  -->  00:06:02.805
Now using some margin we can actually put it where we want.
83

83

00:06:02.805  -->  00:06:06.532
So we just specify some top margin until it is
84

84

00:06:06.532  -->  00:06:09.532
here in the middle where we want it.
85

85

00:06:11.466  -->  00:06:14.466
We just have to try what works here.
86

86

00:06:17.353  -->  00:06:21.020
Margin top, I have no idea, maybe 15 pixels.
87

87

00:06:22.693  -->  00:06:26.301
Then just a margin to the left side
88

88

00:06:26.301  -->  00:06:28.317
so that there's a little space between
89

89

00:06:28.317  -->  00:06:30.234
the image and the text.
90

90

00:06:32.840  -->  00:06:35.590
Margin left, let's say 10 pixels.
91

91

00:06:38.157  -->  00:06:41.074
OK, 15 pixels was not quite enough.
92

92

00:06:42.453  -->  00:06:46.036
Maybe 25 pixels, so margin top could be 25.
93

93

00:06:51.207  -->  00:06:52.790
We're almost there.
94

94

00:06:53.993  -->  00:06:56.326
Let's try it with 30 pixels.
95

95

00:06:59.310  -->  00:07:00.646
And that's it.
96

96

00:07:00.646  -->  00:07:02.729
That looks great I think.
97

97

00:07:04.070  -->  00:07:07.704
So the last thing could be to maybe make
98

98

00:07:07.704  -->  00:07:11.036
this image here a little smaller,
99

99

00:07:11.036  -->  00:07:14.536
and put it right here after this paragraph
100

100

00:07:15.750  -->  00:07:18.333
in the HTML is amazing section.
101

101

00:07:19.744  -->  00:07:21.694
So let's do that.
102

102

00:07:21.694  -->  00:07:23.645
It's very easy.
103

103

00:07:23.645  -->  00:07:25.145
Just cut the image
104

104

00:07:29.543  -->  00:07:31.575
(mumbling),
105

105

00:07:31.575  -->  00:07:35.158
and paste it down here after this paragraph
106

106

00:07:38.482  -->  00:07:41.065
such as we want it, this image.
107

107

00:07:44.113  -->  00:07:48.196
All right, so if you remember as we did it before
108

108

00:07:49.268  -->  00:07:52.902
with this author image, I will now use the same
109

109

00:07:52.902  -->  00:07:56.069
type of selector to select this image.
110

110

00:07:59.473  -->  00:08:02.306
This is inside the blog post diff.
111

111

00:08:04.268  -->  00:08:05.935
So I will just write
112

112

00:08:09.655  -->  00:08:10.988
blog post image.
113

113

00:08:16.470  -->  00:08:19.887
So it's the same situation as we had here
114

114

00:08:20.743  -->  00:08:23.826
with the image inside the author box.
115

115

00:08:25.962  -->  00:08:30.129
Now just let's say we want it to be 150 pixels high.
116

116

00:08:36.560  -->  00:08:40.310
Now to maintain the aspect ratio of the image
117

117

00:08:41.588  -->  00:08:43.921
let's put the width to auto.
118

118

00:08:52.640  -->  00:08:53.807
OK, very well.
119

119

00:08:56.065  -->  00:08:56.898
All right.
120

120

00:08:57.888  -->  00:09:02.114
This web page maybe does not look perfect now,
121

121

00:09:02.114  -->  00:09:06.433
but wow, you learned such a lot in all the lectures
122

122

00:09:06.433  -->  00:09:10.404
of this section, and that's what actually matters.
123

123

00:09:10.404  -->  00:09:12.749
We used margins and pettings.
124

124

00:09:12.749  -->  00:09:15.930
We defined width and used float and clear
125

125

00:09:15.930  -->  00:09:18.368
and created a nice gray border,
126

126

00:09:18.368  -->  00:09:21.793
and even learned a new useful selector.
127

127

00:09:21.793  -->  00:09:24.928
So that's a lot of new stuff.
128

128

00:09:24.928  -->  00:09:27.656
And there's actually only one more thing
129

129

00:09:27.656  -->  00:09:30.048
I wanna show you in this CSS section,
130

130

00:09:30.048  -->  00:09:32.465
which is element positioning.
