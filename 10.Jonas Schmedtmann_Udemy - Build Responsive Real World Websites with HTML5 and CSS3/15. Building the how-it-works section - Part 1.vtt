00:00:01.089  -->  00:00:03.271
<v Voiceover>Welcome back to this project.</v>
2

2

00:00:03.271  -->  00:00:05.547
I am really glad that you're still with me
3

3

00:00:05.547  -->  00:00:07.939
on this amazing journey, and I hope
4

4

00:00:07.939  -->  00:00:10.702
that you're enjoying this course so far.
5

5

00:00:10.702  -->  00:00:13.163
You see this at the end of every lecture,
6

6

00:00:13.163  -->  00:00:16.112
but I still want to tell you again that it's so important
7

7

00:00:16.112  -->  00:00:19.131
that you ask your questions in the course forums,
8

8

00:00:19.131  -->  00:00:22.451
if you have any, of course, because interacting
9

9

00:00:22.451  -->  00:00:25.330
with other students or with me is the best way
10

10

00:00:25.330  -->  00:00:28.070
to learn and to succeed.
11

11

00:00:28.070  -->  00:00:30.996
So now let's move on to the next section.
12

12

00:00:30.996  -->  00:00:33.620
This one is the How-it-Works section.
13

13

00:00:33.620  -->  00:00:36.662
This is our pictures, the section where
14

14

00:00:36.662  -->  00:00:40.307
we explain how ordering food works.
15

15

00:00:40.307  -->  00:00:43.326
With the app screen on the left side,
16

16

00:00:43.326  -->  00:00:46.576
and the three simple steps on the right side.
17

17

00:00:46.576  -->  00:00:48.898
Very simple, but efficient in showing
18

18

00:00:48.898  -->  00:00:52.056
potential customers how Omnifood works.
19

19

00:00:52.056  -->  00:00:56.584
In this lecture, we'll use a lot of the techniques
20

20

00:00:56.584  -->  00:00:59.022
that you're already familiar with.
21

21

00:00:59.022  -->  00:01:02.203
We'll also learn how to draw circles with CSS,
22

22

00:01:02.203  -->  00:01:05.385
a cool technique to make separations between sections,
23

23

00:01:05.385  -->  00:01:07.823
and how to incorporate buttons for the
24

24

00:01:07.823  -->  00:01:10.168
App Store and the Play Store.
25

25

00:01:10.168  -->  00:01:14.335
Who knows? Maybe one day you'll make a website for an app.
26

26

00:01:15.183  -->  00:01:19.100
So as always, we start by adding a new section,
27

27

00:01:22.474  -->  00:01:24.704
right here after the last one.
28

28

00:01:24.704  -->  00:01:28.871
So section, and I'm going call this one section-steps.
29

29

00:01:34.828  -->  00:01:35.661
Alright.
30

30

00:01:37.242  -->  00:01:40.168
This section will have a title such as the
31

31

00:01:40.168  -->  00:01:42.835
second section that we designed.
32

32

00:01:44.650  -->  00:01:47.983
So &lt; div class, and so we need a row now
33

33

00:01:50.339  -->  00:01:52.256
in order to send there.
34

34

00:01:53.148  -->  00:01:56.260
As you hopefully remember, a h2 element
35

35

00:01:56.260  -->  00:02:00.177
where we will put the heading for our sections.
36

36

00:02:01.438  -->  00:02:04.340
And now you gotta know what text to put here,
37

37

00:02:04.340  -->  00:02:07.507
so let's get back to our content file.
38

38

00:02:09.518  -->  00:02:10.768
And here it is.
39

39

00:02:12.932  -->  00:02:16.507
I'm going to copy all of it, as always,
40

40

00:02:16.507  -->  00:02:18.257
and put it down here.
41

41

00:02:23.127  -->  00:02:25.210
So the title is this one,
42

42

00:02:27.075  -->  00:02:28.242
paste it here,
43

43

00:02:29.768  -->  00:02:33.935
and just as the last time, this will be an &amp;mdash.
44

44

00:02:36.014  -->  00:02:38.313
Alright, simple as that.
45

45

00:02:38.313  -->  00:02:42.702
Now in this case, we don't have a paragraph after this,
46

46

00:02:42.702  -->  00:02:46.869
and we'll start it showing the iPhone in the app on the
47

47

00:02:50.272  -->  00:02:54.335
left side, and on the right side the three steps.
48

48

00:02:54.335  -->  00:02:58.422
So this time, we have two columns and not four.
49

49

00:02:58.422  -->  00:03:01.505
So again, we need to start a new row.
50

50

00:03:03.344  -->  00:03:04.927
So class=row*.
51

51

00:03:08.940  -->  00:03:10.940
Now, we have, as I said,
52

52

00:03:15.047  -->  00:03:16.765
two columns.
53

53

00:03:16.765  -->  00:03:20.182
So as always, a column needs to col class
54

54

00:03:21.270  -->  00:03:22.853
it's a span-1-of-2,
55

55

00:03:26.495  -->  00:03:29.397
because we will have two columns.
56

56

00:03:29.397  -->  00:03:32.857
And in the first column, we want our iPhone
57

57

00:03:32.857  -->  00:03:35.024
with the screenshot on it.
58

58

00:03:38.639  -->  00:03:42.331
So it's an image, of course, and we already know
59

59

00:03:42.331  -->  00:03:46.069
it's very easy to put an image on our site.
60

60

00:03:46.069  -->  00:03:49.273
So in the resources folder and image folder,
61

61

00:03:49.273  -->  00:03:51.440
now let's see where it is.
62

62

00:03:53.314  -->  00:03:54.981
App iPhone, I guess.
63

63

00:03:57.493  -->  00:04:00.576
And we also need an alternative text,
64

64

00:04:01.789  -->  00:04:04.789
which can be Omnifood app on iPhone.
65

65

00:04:11.704  -->  00:04:12.537
Okay.
66

66

00:04:14.142  -->  00:04:18.309
And let me just give this a class called maybe app-screen.
67

67

00:04:21.990  -->  00:04:25.407
Alright, so this is the left column here.
68

68

00:04:27.563  -->  00:04:31.230
And now as for the right column, let me just
69

69

00:04:32.509  -->  00:04:34.509
put another column here.
70

70

00:04:36.387  -->  00:04:38.387
And again a span-1-of-2.
71

71

00:04:48.949  -->  00:04:52.699
It's to actually start with three containers,
72

72

00:04:54.196  -->  00:04:56.495
which will then contain the number of the step
73

73

00:04:56.495  -->  00:04:58.745
and the corresponding text.
74

74

00:05:03.784  -->  00:05:06.284
So this we'll call works-step.
75

75

00:05:11.089  -->  00:05:14.506
So step of how-it-works section, alright?
76

76

00:05:17.887  -->  00:05:22.054
Now, the number itself will also be a div element.
77

77

00:05:23.065  -->  00:05:26.398
We don't need a class name here for now,
78

78

00:05:28.800  -->  00:05:32.050
so we will then make just &lt; div rounds.
79

79

00:05:33.282  -->  00:05:36.788
Then for the text, as usual, we will
80

80

00:05:36.788  -->  00:05:39.538
put the text inside of paragraph.
81

81

00:05:41.409  -->  00:05:43.326
And the text down here.
82

82

00:05:49.698  -->  00:05:50.531
Alright.
83

83

00:05:52.392  -->  00:05:54.435
Now I will just copy this and
84

84

00:05:54.435  -->  00:05:57.018
paste this down here two times,
85

85

00:05:58.684  -->  00:06:02.601
because I don't feel like writing it all again.
86

86

00:06:03.561  -->  00:06:06.478
And then just copy the actual text,
87

87

00:06:08.506  -->  00:06:10.839
right into these paragraphs.
88

88

00:06:12.709  -->  00:06:14.292
And the third step.
89

89

00:06:16.982  -->  00:06:19.482
So we don't need this anymore.
90

90

00:06:20.790  -->  00:06:23.483
Now all that's left to put here are those
91

91

00:06:23.483  -->  00:06:25.650
buttons for the App Store,
92

92

00:06:27.384  -->  00:06:31.384
so we also want them inside of this column here.
93

93

00:06:32.632  -->  00:06:37.044
So we can put them right after those three steps.
94

94

00:06:37.044  -->  00:06:38.627
So some space here,
95

95

00:06:40.039  -->  00:06:43.870
and we will take care of the formatting later in CSS.
96

96

00:06:43.870  -->  00:06:46.866
So the buttons are very simple.
97

97

00:06:46.866  -->  00:06:50.616
It's just a link, as you could have imagined,
98

98

00:06:52.044  -->  00:06:54.711
and again, which points nowhere.
99

99

00:06:56.363  -->  00:07:00.030
And put a class, which I will call bttn-app.
100

100

00:07:01.448  -->  00:07:04.768
And now, instead of putting some text here,
101

101

00:07:04.768  -->  00:07:06.463
we will put an image.
102

102

00:07:06.463  -->  00:07:09.880
Then that image will serve as the button.
103

103

00:07:14.637  -->  00:07:16.304
So &lt; img src =,
104

104

00:07:22.903  -->  00:07:24.366
we actually already have
105

105

00:07:24.366  -->  00:07:26.525
those images in our folder, but they are
106

106

00:07:26.525  -->  00:07:28.940
really easy to get from the internet.
107

107

00:07:28.940  -->  00:07:31.982
For instance, the button for the App Store,
108

108

00:07:31.982  -->  00:07:35.419
you can just get it from the Apple website.
109

109

00:07:35.419  -->  00:07:38.205
So in the resources folder, image,
110

110

00:07:38.205  -->  00:07:41.781
and then it should be down here somewhere.
111

111

00:07:41.781  -->  00:07:43.531
So it's Download App.
112

112

00:07:47.284  -->  00:07:50.070
Let's see if that's right, yeah.
113

113

00:07:50.070  -->  00:07:53.903
Now we need an alternative text here, as well.
114

114

00:07:55.179  -->  00:07:57.262
This is App Store Button.
115

115

00:07:59.173  -->  00:08:01.673
Okay, and that's it, actually.
116

116

00:08:02.911  -->  00:08:04.578
That's all it takes.
117

117

00:08:05.930  -->  00:08:09.273
Now I will duplicate this with Command D,
118

118

00:08:09.273  -->  00:08:11.690
and down here just change it.
119

119

00:08:15.148  -->  00:08:16.648
It is app-android.
120

120

00:08:18.979  -->  00:08:21.479
And then here it's Play Store.
121

121

00:08:23.623  -->  00:08:25.620
And that's all it takes.
122

122

00:08:25.620  -->  00:08:29.787
So this is the content of our how-it-works section.
123

123

00:08:31.054  -->  00:08:34.471
So let's save this and go to our browser.
124

124

00:08:38.298  -->  00:08:39.548
And here it is.
125

125

00:08:41.712  -->  00:08:44.045
Unformatted, as you can see,
126

126

00:08:45.845  -->  00:08:49.026
so the title already looks nice,
127

127

00:08:49.026  -->  00:08:51.998
because we already formatted it before.
128

128

00:08:51.998  -->  00:08:55.411
And we have those two columns here that we have defined.
129

129

00:08:55.411  -->  00:08:58.593
And our two buttons, and now we need
130

130

00:08:58.593  -->  00:09:03.004
to go back to CSS and style the whole thing.
131

131

00:09:03.004  -->  00:09:04.421
So let's do that.
