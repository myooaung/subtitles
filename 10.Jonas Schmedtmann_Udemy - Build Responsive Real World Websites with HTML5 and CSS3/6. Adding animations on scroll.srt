00:00:01,268  -->  00:00:03,456
<v Voiceover>Let's create a really great effect</v>
2

2

00:00:03,456  -->  00:00:05,540
using animations on scroll.
3

3

00:00:05,540  -->  00:00:07,947
You will love it and this will make our website
4

4

00:00:07,947  -->  00:00:10,030
look absolutely stunning.
5

5

00:00:11,895  -->  00:00:14,895
And what I'm talking about is this.
6

6

00:00:16,611  -->  00:00:21,194
So these items here have this very cool animation
7

7

00:00:21,194  -->  00:00:25,322
and they fade in as we scroll to their position.
8

8

00:00:25,322  -->  00:00:27,812
And the same thing here with the iPhone
9

9

00:00:27,812  -->  00:00:31,306
which comes down from here and also creates
10

10

00:00:31,306  -->  00:00:32,723
this cool effect.
11

11

00:00:33,648  -->  00:00:37,558
And then here the same thing with the city images
12

12

00:00:37,558  -->  00:00:40,042
and we also have this nice animation here.
13

13

00:00:40,042  -->  00:00:41,205
You saw that.
14

14

00:00:41,205  -->  00:00:44,444
This is to call the attention of the user.
15

15

00:00:44,444  -->  00:00:47,237
So let me now show you how we can do this
16

16

00:00:47,237  -->  00:00:48,904
with jQuery and CSS.
17

17

00:00:51,235  -->  00:00:55,402
So, how are we going to achieve those great animations?
18

18

00:00:56,285  -->  00:00:59,581
Well to start with, there's a very cool
19

19

00:00:59,581  -->  00:01:01,581
CSS animation framework.
20

20

00:01:02,756  -->  00:01:06,923
Because powerful animations can be done just using CSS.
21

21

00:01:07,792  -->  00:01:10,308
And I will show you some of them.
22

22

00:01:10,308  -->  00:01:13,469
So we have a whole lot of different stuff here,
23

23

00:01:13,469  -->  00:01:15,804
and this is like really endless.
24

24

00:01:15,804  -->  00:01:18,518
Let me just show you some of them.
25

25

00:01:18,518  -->  00:01:19,935
Bounce right in.
26

26

00:01:21,667  -->  00:01:23,334
All kinds of stuff.
27

27

00:01:25,948  -->  00:01:29,367
So the one that you saw was this,
28

28

00:01:29,367  -->  00:01:32,617
the pulse, then we saw the bounceInUp,
29

29

00:01:36,764  -->  00:01:38,681
and we saw the fadeIn.
30

30

00:01:39,709  -->  00:01:42,647
And those are the ones we are going to use,
31

31

00:01:42,647  -->  00:01:46,039
and weâ€™re going to use jQuery to actually
32

32

00:01:46,039  -->  00:01:48,122
trigger those animations.
33

33

00:01:49,705  -->  00:01:53,538
So we will now use again the waypoint plug-in.
34

34

00:01:55,594  -->  00:01:57,677
So animations on scroll.
35

35

00:02:01,673  -->  00:02:05,006
And in order to do that we need to again
36

36

00:02:05,872  -->  00:02:08,803
here in HTML file set where we want
37

37

00:02:08,803  -->  00:02:11,619
that animation to happen.
38

38

00:02:11,619  -->  00:02:14,952
So if you remember in the first lecture
39

39

00:02:17,174  -->  00:02:20,424
we used the waypoint right here, right?
40

40

00:02:21,615  -->  00:02:23,865
So, here was our waypoint.
41

41

00:02:26,333  -->  00:02:29,577
Now what we want to do is to animate
42

42

00:02:29,577  -->  00:02:32,994
these four columns here basically, right?
43

43

00:02:33,898  -->  00:02:38,326
So as you saw, these columns will have an animation.
44

44

00:02:38,326  -->  00:02:41,326
And in fact, it is this entire row.
45

45

00:02:45,098  -->  00:02:48,431
So we will just say WP for waypoint one.
46

46

00:02:51,344  -->  00:02:54,671
So this row will have our first waypoint
47

47

00:02:54,671  -->  00:02:56,671
and our first animation.
48

48

00:02:59,190  -->  00:03:01,917
All right so let's do that.
49

49

00:03:01,917  -->  00:03:05,250
And just as we did before, we now select
50

50

00:03:07,533  -->  00:03:08,533
waypoint one
51

51

00:03:10,198  -->  00:03:12,281
and then we say waypoint.
52

52

00:03:17,155  -->  00:03:19,304
And again we know the direction,
53

53

00:03:19,304  -->  00:03:23,054
but in this case we will not use it actually,
54

54

00:03:24,125  -->  00:03:27,453
because this animation will only happen once.
55

55

00:03:27,453  -->  00:03:31,761
And how does this animation actually work with CSS?
56

56

00:03:31,761  -->  00:03:33,295
Let me go back here.
57

57

00:03:33,295  -->  00:03:36,004
All you need to do to animate an element
58

58

00:03:36,004  -->  00:03:38,576
using this Animate.CSS framework
59

59

00:03:38,576  -->  00:03:40,809
is to add a Class, AnimateIt,
60

60

00:03:40,809  -->  00:03:44,392
and then the name of the animation we want.
61

61

00:03:45,871  -->  00:03:48,621
For instance, fadeOut or fadeIn,
62

62

00:03:49,732  -->  00:03:52,525
which is the one we want here.
63

63

00:03:52,525  -->  00:03:55,995
So all we need to do, really all we need
64

64

00:03:55,995  -->  00:03:58,495
is to add, know those Classes,
65

65

00:03:59,792  -->  00:04:03,375
to this exact element that we select here.
66

66

00:04:05,527  -->  00:04:08,027
I actually forgot to do that.
67

67

00:04:10,611  -->  00:04:14,511
So, and now it's really easy we just say
68

68

00:04:14,511  -->  00:04:18,990
add Class as we did before, and then the Classes we add
69

69

00:04:18,990  -->  00:04:21,073
are animated and fade in.
70

70

00:04:26,338  -->  00:04:28,005
Really, really easy.
71

71

00:04:30,025  -->  00:04:31,858
Let's check that out.
72

72

00:04:34,959  -->  00:04:36,565
And in order to do that we actually
73

73

00:04:36,565  -->  00:04:39,148
really need to reload the page.
74

74

00:04:40,322  -->  00:04:42,072
So let's close this.
75

75

00:04:45,807  -->  00:04:49,775
Okay we forgot to do one thing here of course,
76

76

00:04:49,775  -->  00:04:52,048
which is this needs to be invisible
77

77

00:04:52,048  -->  00:04:55,157
before we trigger the animation, right?
78

78

00:04:55,157  -->  00:04:58,357
So otherwise it's impossible that this fades in
79

79

00:04:58,357  -->  00:05:01,357
because it is already visible, okay?
80

80

00:05:02,871  -->  00:05:06,710
So back here, we need to change that in the CSS file.
81

81

00:05:06,710  -->  00:05:09,127
And I will do that down here.
82

82

00:05:10,389  -->  00:05:13,389
Let me just grab a copy of this here
83

83

00:05:14,299  -->  00:05:16,882
and say this is for animations.
84

84

00:05:23,397  -->  00:05:27,064
Okay so JS, (mumbles), one.
85

85

00:05:30,979  -->  00:05:35,030
Now there are a couple of ways of doing this,
86

86

00:05:35,030  -->  00:05:39,197
and you maybe remember one of those was display none,
87

87

00:05:40,438  -->  00:05:43,906
which we used to hide the navigation menu before.
88

88

00:05:43,906  -->  00:05:46,301
But that wouldn't work in this case.
89

89

00:05:46,301  -->  00:05:49,968
In this case we have to say opacity is zero.
90

90

00:05:51,472  -->  00:05:53,527
So pretty straightforward.
91

91

00:05:53,527  -->  00:05:58,373
If we set opacity to zero, that element is not visible.
92

92

00:05:58,373  -->  00:06:02,271
And then once the JS waypoint one Class
93

93

00:06:02,271  -->  00:06:04,478
also has the animated Class,
94

94

00:06:04,478  -->  00:06:07,947
then we want the opacity back to one.
95

95

00:06:07,947  -->  00:06:09,553
So how do we do that?
96

96

00:06:09,553  -->  00:06:11,019
And that is actually a new selector
97

97

00:06:11,019  -->  00:06:13,186
that we didn't use so far.
98

98

00:06:14,405  -->  00:06:16,655
It's like the end selector.
99

99

00:06:18,699  -->  00:06:21,616
So what I did before was like thisâ€¦
100

100

00:06:24,048  -->  00:06:25,898
And then animate it.
101

101

00:06:25,898  -->  00:06:28,516
So this would be animated inside
102

102

00:06:28,516  -->  00:06:31,352
of the JS waypoint one Class.
103

103

00:06:31,352  -->  00:06:33,982
But what I want now is that this Class
104

104

00:06:33,982  -->  00:06:37,323
should have these both Classes at the same time.
105

105

00:06:37,323  -->  00:06:39,990
So this is the selector we use.
106

106

00:06:41,598  -->  00:06:44,447
So that element has a JS waypoint one Class
107

107

00:06:44,447  -->  00:06:47,723
and the animateIt Class at the same time.
108

108

00:06:47,723  -->  00:06:50,806
And then I want opacity back to one.
109

109

00:06:52,011  -->  00:06:55,179
And now of course the most important thing
110

110

00:06:55,179  -->  00:06:58,429
we didn't even do yet is to incorporate
111

111

00:06:59,371  -->  00:07:02,371
this animation CSS framework, right?
112

112

00:07:04,402  -->  00:07:06,402
So let's download that.
113

113

00:07:07,716  -->  00:07:09,133
And here we are.
114

114

00:07:10,398  -->  00:07:14,565
So Omnifood, and it's (mumbles) and it's CSS.
115

115

00:07:17,586  -->  00:07:20,165
So let's put it here.
116

116

00:07:20,165  -->  00:07:23,527
So now I have the animate.CSS file here
117

117

00:07:23,527  -->  00:07:27,444
and let me then incorporate it here, of course.
118

118

00:07:31,023  -->  00:07:33,020
And it could be right here because it's also
119

119

00:07:33,020  -->  00:07:36,437
in the (mumbles) folder.
120

120

00:07:38,670  -->  00:07:40,837
And it's the animate file.
121

121

00:07:41,915  -->  00:07:43,515
Great.
122

122

00:07:43,515  -->  00:07:45,690
And now this will work.
123

123

00:07:45,690  -->  00:07:46,690
Let's see.
124

124

00:07:51,944  -->  00:07:53,694
So we come down here.
125

125

00:07:55,509  -->  00:07:58,635
And okay the animation happens exactly
126

126

00:07:58,635  -->  00:08:01,870
when we hit this part, so the beginning
127

127

00:08:01,870  -->  00:08:05,703
of the waypoint one Class, which is like here.
128

128

00:08:07,413  -->  00:08:11,727
So we of course don't want this to happen this way.
129

129

00:08:11,727  -->  00:08:15,592
We want this to animate when it's like
130

130

00:08:15,592  -->  00:08:17,269
here in this position.
131

131

00:08:17,269  -->  00:08:21,218
So we should set an offset to this code,
132

132

00:08:21,218  -->  00:08:24,551
to this waypoint, such as we did before.
133

133

00:08:26,293  -->  00:08:28,460
And we do this right here.
134

134

00:08:30,411  -->  00:08:31,328
So offset ,
135

135

00:08:33,836  -->  00:08:35,844
let's say 50 percent,
136

136

00:08:35,844  -->  00:08:39,594
because 50 percent would be half of the page.
137

137

00:08:41,155  -->  00:08:44,030
And I think that would be great.
138

138

00:08:44,030  -->  00:08:48,555
And we actually don't want this semicolon here.
139

139

00:08:48,555  -->  00:08:50,222
So let's check this.
140

140

00:08:56,434  -->  00:08:58,263
Here we go.
141

141

00:08:58,263  -->  00:09:02,430
Now it nicely zooms in as we scroll to the element.
142

142

00:09:04,874  -->  00:09:05,707
Very nice.
143

143

00:09:06,738  -->  00:09:08,400
I really like this effect.
144

144

00:09:08,400  -->  00:09:10,769
And now I'm going to do the same thing
145

145

00:09:10,769  -->  00:09:13,527
with this image, and this image should come here
146

146

00:09:13,527  -->  00:09:16,740
from the button all to this place,
147

147

00:09:16,740  -->  00:09:20,849
which creates a nice effect of an image sliding in.
148

148

00:09:20,849  -->  00:09:25,649
And then I will do the fadeIn with these four images
149

149

00:09:25,649  -->  00:09:27,984
so with this whole column.
150

150

00:09:27,984  -->  00:09:31,371
And then I want to grab some attention of the user
151

151

00:09:31,371  -->  00:09:33,668
because there is a cool effect for that
152

152

00:09:33,668  -->  00:09:34,585
here in the
153

153

00:09:36,576  -->  00:09:37,764
in the animate library.
154

154

00:09:37,764  -->  00:09:39,241
It's like this, right?
155

155

00:09:39,241  -->  00:09:40,074
See it?
156

156

00:09:41,310  -->  00:09:43,310
So this is called pulse.
157

157

00:09:44,471  -->  00:09:48,535
And now this should be pretty straightforward.
158

158

00:09:48,535  -->  00:09:51,868
I will just copy this a couple of times.
159

159

00:09:54,225  -->  00:09:56,225
And rename this to three
160

160

00:09:59,241  -->  00:10:00,074
and four.
161

161

00:10:03,421  -->  00:10:04,636
So this is the first one we already did,
162

162

00:10:04,636  -->  00:10:08,830
this will be the second one so the image,
163

163

00:10:08,830  -->  00:10:13,425
these will be the cities, so fade in is just right.
164

164

00:10:13,425  -->  00:10:15,646
And this will then be that pricing plan
165

165

00:10:15,646  -->  00:10:17,063
which will pulse.
166

166

00:10:20,509  -->  00:10:23,259
And the other one is, let me see,
167

167

00:10:25,417  -->  00:10:26,334
bounceInUp.
168

168

00:10:27,717  -->  00:10:30,300
Maybe that's a little too much.
169

169

00:10:31,390  -->  00:10:32,807
I would say fadeâ€¦
170

170

00:10:36,665  -->  00:10:37,498
fadeInUp.
171

171

00:10:39,248  -->  00:10:41,165
Okay, fadeInUp is cool.
172

172

00:10:42,936  -->  00:10:45,853
So fadeInUp here for number three.
173

173

00:10:48,657  -->  00:10:51,563
That's not correct here for number two.
174

174

00:10:51,563  -->  00:10:54,396
So let's now set those waypoints.
175

175

00:10:56,935  -->  00:10:58,018
So second ...
176

176

00:10:59,834  -->  00:11:00,751
is not here
177

177

00:11:03,921  -->  00:11:06,484
and this image is right here, so I want this
178

178

00:11:06,484  -->  00:11:08,651
to be the JS waypoint two.
179

179

00:11:12,509  -->  00:11:15,435
So the image, now the cities,
180

180

00:11:15,435  -->  00:11:17,988
in fact the entire row such as before,
181

181

00:11:17,988  -->  00:11:21,988
so this is the JavaScript waypoint number three.
182

182

00:11:23,596  -->  00:11:27,763
And then, so where is this pricing plan that I wantâ€¦
183

183

00:11:29,527  -->  00:11:31,537
It is plan box.
184

184

00:11:31,537  -->  00:11:33,354
Exactly this one.
185

185

00:11:33,354  -->  00:11:36,437
So here I will add JS waypoint two...
186

186

00:11:40,363  -->  00:11:41,196
Four.
187

187

00:11:42,302  -->  00:11:44,445
And now here in the CSS we need to come back
188

188

00:11:44,445  -->  00:11:46,945
down here and do this one here
189

189

00:11:49,161  -->  00:11:53,011
for all the waypoints that will fadeIn.
190

190

00:11:53,011  -->  00:11:55,914
So number one, two and three, because number four
191

191

00:11:55,914  -->  00:11:57,831
does not fadeIn, right?
192

192

00:11:58,717  -->  00:12:02,300
Number four just has those pulsing effect.
193

193

00:12:07,447  -->  00:12:08,864
So two and three.
194

194

00:12:10,970  -->  00:12:13,053
So, let's check this out.
195

195

00:12:19,613  -->  00:12:20,696
Here we are.
196

196

00:12:22,262  -->  00:12:26,198
There comes the second one, very nice.
197

197

00:12:26,198  -->  00:12:28,115
This is also very nice.
198

198

00:12:29,954  -->  00:12:31,420
And this pulsing effect.
199

199

00:12:31,420  -->  00:12:35,925
So all of them work exactly the way we want this.
200

200

00:12:35,925  -->  00:12:37,699
Now there's only one more thing that I want
201

201

00:12:37,699  -->  00:12:39,689
to show you with this.
202

202

00:12:39,689  -->  00:12:41,628
And for instance we saw that this animation
203

203

00:12:41,628  -->  00:12:46,140
was a little bit slow, so we have a way to change that
204

204

00:12:46,140  -->  00:12:48,899
with pure CSS once again.
205

205

00:12:48,899  -->  00:12:52,574
And what I'm talking about is animation,
206

206

00:12:52,574  -->  00:12:54,157
animation duration.
207

207

00:12:55,403  -->  00:12:57,986
Now weâ€™ll set it to one second.
208

208

00:12:59,199  -->  00:13:00,032
All right?
209

209

00:13:01,700  -->  00:13:05,617
And the same thing of course for waypoint four.
210

210

00:13:06,879  -->  00:13:08,046
Waypoint four,
211

211

00:13:10,254  -->  00:13:12,837
animation duration, one second.
212

212

00:13:15,352  -->  00:13:17,685
And I will also prefix this,
213

213

00:13:19,461  -->  00:13:24,050
and you see now we have those WebKit prefixes.
214

214

00:13:24,050  -->  00:13:26,050
So let's try that again.
215

215

00:13:27,160  -->  00:13:31,356
So these animations are a little annoying
216

216

00:13:31,356  -->  00:13:35,523
because we have to re-open the website all the time.
217

217

00:13:37,957  -->  00:13:41,259
So this is faster now as you can see.
218

218

00:13:41,259  -->  00:13:44,934
And this was also a little faster.
219

219

00:13:44,934  -->  00:13:47,184
And I think also this one.
220

220

00:13:48,256  -->  00:13:51,263
So this was triggering animations on scroll.
221

221

00:13:51,263  -->  00:13:53,881
You can do all kinds of effect with this.
222

222

00:13:53,881  -->  00:13:58,175
This was just to show you the basics of animations.
223

223

00:13:58,175  -->  00:13:59,609
You can do all the stuff, and in fact,
224

224

00:13:59,609  -->  00:14:03,192
you can also use this animate.CSS framework
225

225

00:14:04,235  -->  00:14:06,911
completely without jQuery.
226

226

00:14:06,911  -->  00:14:10,411
You can just add those Classes that we add
227

227

00:14:11,474  -->  00:14:13,497
in HTML and then those elements
228

228

00:14:13,497  -->  00:14:15,372
will animate in the beginning.
229

229

00:14:15,372  -->  00:14:17,483
Simple as that.
230

230

00:14:17,483  -->  00:14:20,831
And so we have only one more jQuery lecture left,
231

231

00:14:20,831  -->  00:14:23,020
and so in the next video, we will make our
232

232

00:14:23,020  -->  00:14:25,433
navigation responsive because that's
233

233

00:14:25,433  -->  00:14:28,249
an important part that we left out
234

234

00:14:28,249  -->  00:14:30,848
as we make our website responsive.
235

235

00:14:30,848  -->  00:14:32,348
So, see you there.
