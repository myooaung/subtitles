00:00:01,500  -->  00:00:03,564
<v Voiceover>Color is probably the most complicated</v>
2

2

00:00:03,564  -->  00:00:06,725
area of user interface design.
3

3

00:00:06,725  -->  00:00:09,508
This is because we have a tendency to use colors
4

4

00:00:09,508  -->  00:00:13,348
that distract and feel completely unnatural.
5

5

00:00:13,348  -->  00:00:16,076
That can make our design look very messy.
6

6

00:00:16,076  -->  00:00:18,604
Do you want an example of this?
7

7

00:00:18,604  -->  00:00:19,943
Here you go.
8

8

00:00:19,943  -->  00:00:21,428
What do you say now?
9

9

00:00:21,428  -->  00:00:23,298
This is probably the worst website
10

10

00:00:23,298  -->  00:00:25,916
I have ever seen in my entire life.
11

11

00:00:25,916  -->  00:00:29,908
But this is obviously a joke, but you get the point right?
12

12

00:00:29,908  -->  00:00:33,436
So let's try to avoid messy websites like this one
13

13

00:00:33,436  -->  00:00:37,482
with the guidelines I will show you in this lecture.
14

14

00:00:37,482  -->  00:00:39,604
The first thing I want to recommend
15

15

00:00:39,604  -->  00:00:43,538
is to use a single base color for your design.
16

16

00:00:43,538  -->  00:00:46,683
And with base color I mean any different color than
17

17

00:00:46,683  -->  00:00:49,600
black, white or some shade of grey.
18

18

00:00:50,599  -->  00:00:53,218
If we want to build a clean and simple website
19

19

00:00:53,218  -->  00:00:57,815
having too many colors in too many places all over a website
20

20

00:00:57,815  -->  00:01:01,751
is an easy way to completely screw up that goal.
21

21

00:01:01,751  -->  00:01:06,207
So sticking to one main color is definitely a good idea.
22

22

00:01:06,207  -->  00:01:09,622
Especially if you are just starting out with design.
23

23

00:01:09,622  -->  00:01:11,987
The colors you see hear on this slide
24

24

00:01:11,987  -->  00:01:15,303
are from a tool called Flat UI Colors.
25

25

00:01:15,303  -->  00:01:18,447
Flat UI Colors is a very cool resource
26

26

00:01:18,447  -->  00:01:20,808
to choose your base color.
27

27

00:01:20,808  -->  00:01:22,104
To start out,
28

28

00:01:22,104  -->  00:01:26,271
I think you can't go wrong by choosing any of these colors.
29

29

00:01:27,168  -->  00:01:31,273
And beside fixing a base color you can also create a darker
30

30

00:01:31,273  -->  00:01:34,182
or a lighter version of that color.
31

31

00:01:34,182  -->  00:01:37,638
Doing so you can create a nice color palette
32

32

00:01:37,638  -->  00:01:39,818
like this one here.
33

33

00:01:39,818  -->  00:01:42,165
A color palette shows all the colors
34

34

00:01:42,165  -->  00:01:44,880
to be used in a certain design.
35

35

00:01:44,880  -->  00:01:48,713
I use a tool call 0To255 to create that darker
36

36

00:01:49,922  -->  00:01:52,089
and that light blue tones.
37

37

00:01:53,813  -->  00:01:56,915
I strongly recommend to create color palette like this one
38

38

00:01:56,915  -->  00:01:59,002
for your design.
39

39

00:01:59,002  -->  00:02:00,998
As I said before the grey tones
40

40

00:02:00,998  -->  00:02:03,716
are not considered base colors here,
41

41

00:02:03,716  -->  00:02:06,270
and we many times need some of them actually.
42

42

00:02:06,270  -->  00:02:09,895
For instance for text and for background colors.
43

43

00:02:09,895  -->  00:02:13,248
Find the link to these two tools that I mentioned
44

44

00:02:13,248  -->  00:02:14,915
in the course Ebook.
45

45

00:02:16,697  -->  00:02:19,715
Now if you really want to mix up multiple colors
46

46

00:02:19,715  -->  00:02:22,934
I recommend you use a color wheel tool
47

47

00:02:22,934  -->  00:02:26,296
Like Adobe Color CC or Paletton.
48

48

00:02:26,296  -->  00:02:29,175
These tools make use of color theory
49

49

00:02:29,175  -->  00:02:32,571
to choose the best color combinations for you.
50

50

00:02:32,571  -->  00:02:35,704
So for example here with Adobe CC Color
51

51

00:02:35,704  -->  00:02:39,600
you can create your color palettes using color combinations
52

52

00:02:39,600  -->  00:02:41,758
that actually make sense.
53

53

00:02:41,758  -->  00:02:45,591
Just play around with it and see what you get.
54

54

00:02:46,460  -->  00:02:49,275
You can then use a main color to draw attention
55

55

00:02:49,275  -->  00:02:52,526
to the most important elements on your web page.
56

56

00:02:52,526  -->  00:02:54,733
Like a call to action button
57

57

00:02:54,733  -->  00:02:59,477
and a second or third colors can complement the main color.
58

58

00:02:59,477  -->  00:03:02,330
That is just what this website is doing.
59

59

00:03:02,330  -->  00:03:05,255
Their main color is clearly green
60

60

00:03:05,255  -->  00:03:08,301
but they have this nice orange to draw the attention
61

61

00:03:08,301  -->  00:03:09,468
to the button.
62

62

00:03:11,209  -->  00:03:13,316
And that brings us to the next guideline
63

63

00:03:13,316  -->  00:03:15,735
which is about attention.
64

64

00:03:15,735  -->  00:03:17,531
When you're in doubt about using colors
65

65

00:03:17,531  -->  00:03:20,683
and don't know where to use colors and how often,
66

66

00:03:20,683  -->  00:03:22,502
I have a solution for you.
67

67

00:03:22,502  -->  00:03:25,114
Just pick a color that stands out and use it
68

68

00:03:25,114  -->  00:03:28,048
mostly to draw attention to a button
69

69

00:03:28,048  -->  00:03:32,428
or any other element of importance on your website
70

70

00:03:32,428  -->  00:03:35,105
Uber's website here does a terrific job
71

71

00:03:35,105  -->  00:03:36,938
in doing exactly that.
72

72

00:03:38,576  -->  00:03:40,949
At number four, and this is very simple,
73

73

00:03:40,949  -->  00:03:45,036
never choose the black color for any part of your design.
74

74

00:03:45,036  -->  00:03:47,776
This is because black actually almost never appears
75

75

00:03:47,776  -->  00:03:49,462
in the real world.
76

76

00:03:49,462  -->  00:03:53,629
So using complete black just doesn't feel natural.
77

77

00:03:54,835  -->  00:03:58,105
And last but not least I want to say a few words
78

78

00:03:58,105  -->  00:04:02,616
on which colors you should actually choose for your design.
79

79

00:04:02,616  -->  00:04:05,738
That's because picking a color for a website means
80

80

00:04:05,738  -->  00:04:08,391
much more than picking your favorite color
81

81

00:04:08,391  -->  00:04:10,857
and turning it into a design.
82

82

00:04:10,857  -->  00:04:12,706
It means picking the right color
83

83

00:04:12,706  -->  00:04:16,791
in order to get the desired response from your audience.
84

84

00:04:16,791  -->  00:04:19,255
Color really makes a difference.
85

85

00:04:19,255  -->  00:04:22,375
This happens because there are psychological effects
86

86

00:04:22,375  -->  00:04:24,510
behind each color.
87

87

00:04:24,510  -->  00:04:27,693
So let's see what feelings each color can evoke
88

88

00:04:27,693  -->  00:04:30,193
and how to use this knowledge.
89

89

00:04:31,442  -->  00:04:34,760
Red is a great color to use when power, passion,
90

90

00:04:34,760  -->  00:04:39,048
strength and excitement want to be transmitted.
91

91

00:04:39,048  -->  00:04:41,679
Brighter tones are more energetic
92

92

00:04:41,679  -->  00:04:45,967
and darker shades are more powerful and elegant.
93

93

00:04:45,967  -->  00:04:50,816
Orange draws attention without being as overpowering as red.
94

94

00:04:50,816  -->  00:04:54,305
It means cheerfulness and creativity.
95

95

00:04:54,305  -->  00:04:56,633
Orange can be associated with friendliness,
96

96

00:04:56,633  -->  00:04:58,550
confidence and courage.
97

97

00:05:00,328  -->  00:05:01,420
Now Yellow.
98

98

00:05:01,420  -->  00:05:04,235
Yellow is energetic and gives the feeling of happiness
99

99

00:05:04,235  -->  00:05:06,080
and liveliness.
100

100

00:05:06,080  -->  00:05:09,958
Also it associates with curiosity, intelligence,
101

101

00:05:09,958  -->  00:05:11,791
brightness, et cetera.
102

102

00:05:13,662  -->  00:05:17,829
Green is the color of harmony, nature, life and health.
103

103

00:05:19,145  -->  00:05:22,558
Also it is often associated with money.
104

104

00:05:22,558  -->  00:05:26,725
In design green can have a balancing and harmonizing effect.
105

105

00:05:28,143  -->  00:05:32,457
Next, Blue means patience, peace, trustworthiness
106

106

00:05:32,457  -->  00:05:34,170
and stability.
107

107

00:05:34,170  -->  00:05:38,650
It is one of the most beloved colors, especially by men.
108

108

00:05:38,650  -->  00:05:42,716
It is associated with professionalism, trust and honor.
109

109

00:05:42,716  -->  00:05:45,088
And that's actually why the biggest Social Networks
110

110

00:05:45,088  -->  00:05:47,505
out there use the color blue.
111

111

00:05:49,248  -->  00:05:52,126
Purple is traditionally associated with power,
112

112

00:05:52,126  -->  00:05:54,473
nobility and wealth.
113

113

00:05:54,473  -->  00:05:58,088
In your design purple can give a sense of wisdom,
114

114

00:05:58,088  -->  00:06:01,255
royalty, nobility, luxury and mystery.
115

115

00:06:03,429  -->  00:06:06,989
Pink expresses romance, passivity, care,
116

116

00:06:06,989  -->  00:06:09,322
peace, affection, et cetera.
117

117

00:06:11,019  -->  00:06:14,578
And finally the color brown is the color of
118

118

00:06:14,578  -->  00:06:17,303
relaxation and confidence.
119

119

00:06:17,303  -->  00:06:20,964
Brown itself means earthiness, nature, durability,
120

120

00:06:20,964  -->  00:06:22,964
comfort and reliability.
121

121

00:06:25,435  -->  00:06:28,507
And that's it for colors in this lecture.
122

122

00:06:28,507  -->  00:06:30,835
If you want to learn more on this subject,
123

123

00:06:30,835  -->  00:06:34,009
I included a couple of links in the course Ebook,
124

124

00:06:34,009  -->  00:06:36,988
where you can read all about color theory,
125

125

00:06:36,988  -->  00:06:39,405
make sure you check them out.
