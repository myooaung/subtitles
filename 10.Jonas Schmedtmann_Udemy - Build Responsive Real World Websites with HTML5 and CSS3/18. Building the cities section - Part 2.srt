00:00:01,025  -->  00:00:02,705
<v Voiceover>So welcome back to Part 2</v>
2

2

00:00:02,705  -->  00:00:05,206
of Building the cities section.
3

3

00:00:05,206  -->  00:00:10,106
Without further ado, let's go back to our website,
4

4

00:00:10,106  -->  00:00:12,099
and this is where we left.
5

5

00:00:12,099  -->  00:00:15,444
Now formatting this shouldn't be so hard, right?
6

6

00:00:15,444  -->  00:00:18,876
We will start with the images now.
7

7

00:00:18,876  -->  00:00:22,702
And, yeah, you should probably do this
8

8

00:00:22,702  -->  00:00:24,110
on your own now.
9

9

00:00:24,110  -->  00:00:27,443
So I will give you some time to do that.
10

10

00:00:30,525  -->  00:00:32,091
All right.
11

11

00:00:32,091  -->  00:00:35,169
So maybe you paused the video and did it by yourself.
12

12

00:00:35,169  -->  00:00:38,086
So now let's see how I would do it.
13

13

00:00:40,589  -->  00:00:42,247
Okay,
14

14

00:00:42,247  -->  00:00:44,164
so this is a box class,
15

15

00:00:46,791  -->  00:00:51,631
and I want to select the image inside of the box.
16

16

00:00:51,631  -->  00:00:55,613
Now this could be a problem if we had other boxes
17

17

00:00:55,613  -->  00:00:57,669
with images inside of them,
18

18

00:00:57,669  -->  00:01:01,372
but, as you know, the other box that we have
19

19

00:01:01,372  -->  00:01:03,205
is this image up here.
20

20

00:01:04,054  -->  00:01:06,471
Sorry, it's this box up here,
21

21

00:01:07,409  -->  00:01:11,136
and there is no image inside of this.
22

22

00:01:11,136  -->  00:01:13,434
So we can just use
23

23

00:01:13,434  -->  00:01:16,767
the selector that we're already used to.
24

24

00:01:22,257  -->  00:01:23,090
Okay.
25

25

00:01:25,626  -->  00:01:28,626
Let's add another code section here.
26

26

00:01:30,269  -->  00:01:32,186
This one is the cities.
27

27

00:01:38,290  -->  00:01:41,264
I really like some consistency here.
28

28

00:01:41,264  -->  00:01:43,181
And now, box and image.
29

29

00:01:46,381  -->  00:01:49,220
And what we want here is the image
30

30

00:01:49,220  -->  00:01:52,329
to be exactly as wide as the box.
31

31

00:01:52,329  -->  00:01:53,746
So what we say is
32

32

00:01:55,596  -->  00:01:57,013
width, 100%.
33

33

00:01:59,225  -->  00:02:03,392
And obviously the height will then be set automatically.
34

34

00:02:04,728  -->  00:02:07,523
And we can maybe have some margin
35

35

00:02:07,523  -->  00:02:10,106
between the box and H3 heading.
36

36

00:02:11,447  -->  00:02:15,444
So let's just add some margin to the bottom here
37

37

00:02:15,444  -->  00:02:17,027
of maybe 15 pixels.
38

38

00:02:20,634  -->  00:02:22,717
And let's check this out.
39

39

00:02:25,614  -->  00:02:28,250
Okay, cool, this is great.
40

40

00:02:28,250  -->  00:02:31,000
And now let's add some
41

41

00:02:31,000  -->  00:02:31,833
margin to
42

42

00:02:33,733  -->  00:02:35,150
these lines here.
43

43

00:02:36,446  -->  00:02:40,613
And if you remember each of those is a DIV element called
44

44

00:02:43,368  -->  00:02:44,451
city-feature.
45

45

00:02:45,716  -->  00:02:46,549
All right,
46

46

00:02:47,791  -->  00:02:48,874
city-feature.
47

47

00:02:53,130  -->  00:02:55,541
And maybe a margin to the bottom of each
48

48

00:02:55,541  -->  00:02:57,458
of them of five pixels.
49

49

00:03:01,454  -->  00:03:02,454
Okay, great.
50

50

00:03:04,252  -->  00:03:07,584
And now comes the most difficult part
51

51

00:03:07,584  -->  00:03:11,084
which is to format those icons right here.
52

52

00:03:12,252  -->  00:03:14,690
I would like to make them a little bigger
53

53

00:03:14,690  -->  00:03:16,107
and maybe aligned
54

54

00:03:17,406  -->  00:03:19,595
to one each other
55

55

00:03:19,595  -->  00:03:22,491
and have an orange color.
56

56

00:03:22,491  -->  00:03:24,491
So let's try to do that.
57

57

00:03:25,766  -->  00:03:30,091
So if you remember the other icons that we used,
58

58

00:03:30,091  -->  00:03:33,136
we actually gave them a class name.
59

59

00:03:33,136  -->  00:03:35,969
As you can see here we called them
60

60

00:03:36,811  -->  00:03:37,806
icon-big.
61

61

00:03:37,806  -->  00:03:41,139
So now let's call these ones icon-small.
62

62

00:03:42,497  -->  00:03:46,497
I should have done this before I started to copy
63

63

00:03:47,530  -->  00:03:48,780
but, all right.
64

64

00:03:52,145  -->  00:03:56,404
Now we have to copy it all, in all classes here,
65

65

00:03:56,404  -->  00:03:57,487
in all icons,
66

66

00:04:00,108  -->  00:04:02,941
but it doesn't take so long, so...
67

67

00:04:07,607  -->  00:04:09,774
Person, star, and twitter.
68

68

00:04:12,525  -->  00:04:13,358
Right.
69

69

00:04:14,408  -->  00:04:16,491
So let's go back here to
70

70

00:04:18,313  -->  00:04:22,248
the reusable section where we have our icons.
71

71

00:04:22,248  -->  00:04:23,498
So, icon-small.
72

72

00:04:27,587  -->  00:04:29,695
All right, so the first thing is
73

73

00:04:29,695  -->  00:04:33,394
to make them kind of aligned to each other.
74

74

00:04:33,394  -->  00:04:36,211
So what I will start doing
75

75

00:04:36,211  -->  00:04:40,378
is to say that I want to see these as inline-blocks
76

76

00:04:41,346  -->  00:04:44,346
so that I can assign them some width
77

77

00:04:46,327  -->  00:04:49,868
which I will say should be 30 pixels.
78

78

00:04:49,868  -->  00:04:53,035
And this way, I can now say text-align
79

79

00:04:54,781  -->  00:04:57,852
and then I can center them
80

80

00:04:57,852  -->  00:05:00,185
inside of this inline-block,
81

81

00:05:02,628  -->  00:05:03,565
and this should work.
82

82

00:05:03,565  -->  00:05:05,565
Now I will also want to
83

83

00:05:08,579  -->  00:05:12,333
give them this nice orange color that we used before.
84

84

00:05:12,333  -->  00:05:13,583
We get it here.
85

85

00:05:15,294  -->  00:05:16,127
and
86

86

00:05:17,277  -->  00:05:18,944
paste it right here,
87

87

00:05:20,890  -->  00:05:23,653
and we obviously also want those
88

88

00:05:23,653  -->  00:05:26,312
icons to be a little bigger.
89

89

00:05:26,312  -->  00:05:30,167
And if you remember, this is an icon font.
90

90

00:05:30,167  -->  00:05:33,231
So I can just adjust the font-size
91

91

00:05:33,231  -->  00:05:36,731
and let's say for instance 120% here.
92

92

00:05:39,456  -->  00:05:42,123
So let's see what it looks like.
93

93

00:05:44,064  -->  00:05:47,570
Okay, so you can see that these icons
94

94

00:05:47,570  -->  00:05:51,251
are not quite aligned with the text, right?
95

95

00:05:51,251  -->  00:05:53,944
So what can we do about this?
96

96

00:05:53,944  -->  00:05:56,277
Let me use a nice technique,
97

97

00:05:57,729  -->  00:05:59,888
and I will say that the line-height
98

98

00:05:59,888  -->  00:06:01,888
should also be 120%
99

99

00:06:04,730  -->  00:06:08,897
and that the vertical-align should be to the middle.
100

100

00:06:10,129  -->  00:06:12,962
And maybe that solves our problem.
101

101

00:06:14,888  -->  00:06:19,055
Okay, this doesn't quite look like I would like to
102

102

00:06:20,612  -->  00:06:23,387
because now it's the other way.
103

103

00:06:23,387  -->  00:06:25,964
They are now too way down here, right?
104

104

00:06:25,964  -->  00:06:28,286
They're still not aligned.
105

105

00:06:28,286  -->  00:06:32,369
So let me tell you another technique you can use.
106

106

00:06:33,592  -->  00:06:37,865
So there are three secrets essentially to align those.
107

107

00:06:37,865  -->  00:06:41,532
Let me write it here so you can remember it.
108

108

00:06:42,451  -->  00:06:43,284
Secrets
109

109

00:06:46,942  -->  00:06:48,942
to align text and icons.
110

110

00:06:52,033  -->  00:06:55,704
So comments are a great way to do exactly that, right,
111

111

00:06:55,704  -->  00:06:57,371
to comment our code.
112

112

00:06:58,913  -->  00:07:01,580
So we can now set another margin
113

113

00:07:03,946  -->  00:07:06,087
to the top, and this is a new thing
114

114

00:07:06,087  -->  00:07:09,513
because now we will set a negative margin.
115

115

00:07:09,513  -->  00:07:12,096
So negative margin does exactly
116

116

00:07:13,788  -->  00:07:17,365
the opposite thing than a positive margin.
117

117

00:07:17,365  -->  00:07:21,134
So a positive margin gives us space,
118

118

00:07:21,134  -->  00:07:25,582
and a negative margin is kind of, takes space away.
119

119

00:07:25,582  -->  00:07:27,832
So this will pull our icons
120

120

00:07:29,248  -->  00:07:31,998
to the top two pixels, hopefully.
121

121

00:07:33,007  -->  00:07:35,507
Well, let's see if this works.
122

122

00:07:37,908  -->  00:07:39,839
Two was maybe not enough.
123

123

00:07:39,839  -->  00:07:41,672
Let me use four pixels
124

124

00:07:46,694  -->  00:07:49,532
and four pixels actually looks great.
125

125

00:07:49,532  -->  00:07:52,115
So this is nicely aligned here,
126

126

00:07:55,488  -->  00:07:57,764
and I think this looks quite good.
127

127

00:07:57,764  -->  00:08:00,847
Maybe five pixels would also be okay.
128

128

00:08:03,209  -->  00:08:04,753
And another thing we can do is
129

129

00:08:04,753  -->  00:08:07,133
to add some margin to the right,
130

130

00:08:07,133  -->  00:08:11,313
so we have some space between icon and the text, right?
131

131

00:08:11,313  -->  00:08:13,229
So let me do that as well.
132

132

00:08:13,229  -->  00:08:16,351
So five pixels here can be better
133

133

00:08:16,351  -->  00:08:20,518
and the margin to the right of, let's say, 10 pixels,
134

134

00:08:22,528  -->  00:08:25,945
and, with this, I think we're good to go.
135

135

00:08:27,765  -->  00:08:28,598
Yeah, that's it.
136

136

00:08:28,598  -->  00:08:30,515
This looks cool, right?
137

137

00:08:31,932  -->  00:08:35,468
Now there's only one thing left to do in this section,
138

138

00:08:35,468  -->  00:08:39,809
which is to turn this Twitter user names here into links
139

139

00:08:39,809  -->  00:08:42,892
and then format those links with CSS.
140

140

00:08:43,949  -->  00:08:45,366
So let's do that.
141

141

00:08:46,287  -->  00:08:48,787
So back here in the HTML file,
142

142

00:08:51,414  -->  00:08:53,793
let me just go here.
143

143

00:08:53,793  -->  00:08:56,876
So we want a want an A-element
144

144

00:08:56,876  -->  00:08:58,293
for a link right?
145

145

00:08:59,993  -->  00:09:00,826
Href,
146

146

00:09:03,001  -->  00:09:06,334
and once again we have nowhere to point.
147

147

00:09:07,412  -->  00:09:08,329
this thing.
148

148

00:09:09,595  -->  00:09:12,095
So we just use the hash symbol
149

149

00:09:14,332  -->  00:09:16,582
and let's do the same thing
150

150

00:09:18,173  -->  00:09:19,006
for each
151

151

00:09:22,198  -->  00:09:23,781
of the four cities.
152

152

00:09:30,888  -->  00:09:32,471
So, Berlin is next.
153

153

00:09:36,948  -->  00:09:37,781
Nowhere,
154

154

00:09:41,406  -->  00:09:42,239
and now
155

155

00:09:44,439  -->  00:09:45,939
the last one here.
156

156

00:09:54,048  -->  00:09:56,298
So, what does it look like?
157

157

00:09:58,705  -->  00:10:00,888
Okay, these are just some normal links
158

158

00:10:00,888  -->  00:10:03,055
as you are used to seeing.
159

159

00:10:04,127  -->  00:10:07,330
So what I want to do now is to have links
160

160

00:10:07,330  -->  00:10:08,997
in the orange color,
161

161

00:10:10,733  -->  00:10:14,900
and I also want a more beautiful underlining than this one.
162

162

00:10:16,275  -->  00:10:18,164
So, first of all, I will change the color
163

163

00:10:18,164  -->  00:10:21,217
and I will get rid of this underlining,
164

164

00:10:21,217  -->  00:10:23,900
and we have already done this before.
165

165

00:10:23,900  -->  00:10:27,108
So this will be not different
166

166

00:10:27,108  -->  00:10:28,691
from the last time.
167

167

00:10:29,798  -->  00:10:31,881
So I will just open a new
168

168

00:10:34,689  -->  00:10:36,226
code section here
169

169

00:10:36,226  -->  00:10:39,559
for generic links because we will use these links
170

170

00:10:39,559  -->  00:10:41,392
in more places, maybe.
171

171

00:10:44,530  -->  00:10:48,013
So now I have to format all links at the same time,
172

172

00:10:48,013  -->  00:10:49,346
and so I just use the A
173

173

00:10:49,346  -->  00:10:52,772
because that's for the most generic links,
174

174

00:10:52,772  -->  00:10:56,825
and I will here, such as I did the last time,
175

175

00:10:56,825  -->  00:10:58,158
specify the link
176

176

00:10:59,508  -->  00:11:01,258
and the active state.
177

177

00:11:03,233  -->  00:11:05,983
So I want the color to be orange.
178

178

00:11:10,301  -->  00:11:11,134
So orange,
179

179

00:11:14,484  -->  00:11:16,771
and I want no text underlined.
180

180

00:11:16,771  -->  00:11:19,354
So, it's text-decoration, none.
181

181

00:11:23,528  -->  00:11:24,778
Simple as that.
182

182

00:11:25,931  -->  00:11:27,514
And now what I want
183

183

00:11:29,189  -->  00:11:31,748
is instead of this underline,
184

184

00:11:31,748  -->  00:11:34,452
I actually want an underline
185

185

00:11:34,452  -->  00:11:37,892
because that's what most users are used to
186

186

00:11:37,892  -->  00:11:39,642
when they see a link,
187

187

00:11:40,594  -->  00:11:43,531
but we will do that in a more beautiful way
188

188

00:11:43,531  -->  00:11:46,406
and that's with a border-bottom.
189

189

00:11:46,406  -->  00:11:48,573
So a border at the bottom.
190

190

00:11:49,464  -->  00:11:51,964
The simple one pixel and solid
191

191

00:11:53,130  -->  00:11:55,047
and, also, this orange.
192

192

00:11:56,314  -->  00:11:58,529
And to make it even more stand out,
193

193

00:11:58,529  -->  00:12:01,867
we'll add a padding at the bottom.
194

194

00:12:01,867  -->  00:12:03,284
One pixel, maybe.
195

195

00:12:04,291  -->  00:12:08,458
So we have some space between the text and the border.
196

196

00:12:09,375  -->  00:12:12,042
So let's see what it looks like.
197

197

00:12:12,949  -->  00:12:15,831
Have to get rid of these blue boxes
198

198

00:12:15,831  -->  00:12:19,414
what comes every time we select an element.
199

199

00:12:21,981  -->  00:12:24,512
Okay, this is what it looks like.
200

200

00:12:24,512  -->  00:12:26,233
Cool, right?
201

201

00:12:26,233  -->  00:12:30,424
And now one thing left to do is to say what should happen
202

202

00:12:30,424  -->  00:12:33,007
when we hover this link, right?
203

203

00:12:34,964  -->  00:12:37,295
Okay, so let's do that.
204

204

00:12:37,295  -->  00:12:38,928
And as you already know,
205

205

00:12:38,928  -->  00:12:40,511
we now say a, hover
206

206

00:12:43,637  -->  00:12:44,804
and a, active,
207

207

00:12:48,801  -->  00:12:50,927
and up here its actually not active.
208

208

00:12:50,927  -->  00:12:53,010
Of course, it is visited.
209

209

00:12:54,234  -->  00:12:58,123
So what we want to happen when we hover a link,
210

210

00:12:58,123  -->  00:13:02,994
we want it to become the color of the normal text
211

211

00:13:02,994  -->  00:13:07,495
which is, if you remember from the beginning,
212

212

00:13:07,495  -->  00:13:10,394
was like the first thing we set.
213

213

00:13:10,394  -->  00:13:11,561
Color is this,
214

214

00:13:13,552  -->  00:13:14,385
grey.
215

215

00:13:15,423  -->  00:13:18,991
And we also want the border to disappear,
216

216

00:13:18,991  -->  00:13:21,908
and do you remember how we do that?
217

217

00:13:22,959  -->  00:13:26,004
So, instead of saying we want it to zero pixels,
218

218

00:13:26,004  -->  00:13:28,075
we simply make it transparent,
219

219

00:13:28,075  -->  00:13:31,325
because that's a much cleaner solution.
220

220

00:13:32,683  -->  00:13:33,766
Transparent.
221

221

00:13:35,701  -->  00:13:38,002
Oh, and, again, we want this to happen
222

222

00:13:38,002  -->  00:13:39,919
with a nice transition.
223

223

00:13:41,634  -->  00:13:43,938
So, like an animation.
224

224

00:13:43,938  -->  00:13:45,938
So we choose transition,
225

225

00:13:48,238  -->  00:13:49,321
border-bottom
226

226

00:13:52,987  -->  00:13:55,468
and, again, an interval of 0.2 seconds
227

227

00:13:55,468  -->  00:13:58,635
and we also want to animate the color.
228

228

00:14:01,156  -->  00:14:01,989
So
229

229

00:14:04,072  -->  00:14:05,072
0.2 seconds,
230

230

00:14:07,406  -->  00:14:09,645
and that should do the job.
231

231

00:14:09,645  -->  00:14:11,228
What it looks like?
232

232

00:14:14,351  -->  00:14:15,434
Okay, great.
233

233

00:14:15,434  -->  00:14:19,151
This is exactly what we wanted the links to do here, right?
234

234

00:14:19,151  -->  00:14:23,318
Now one thing, what did we notice here is this one,
235

235

00:14:24,566  -->  00:14:26,549
because this is also a link.
236

236

00:14:26,549  -->  00:14:28,549
This now also have this
237

237

00:14:30,820  -->  00:14:34,903
annoying underline which we actually don't want.
238

238

00:14:35,748  -->  00:14:37,697
This one don't have it.
239

239

00:14:37,697  -->  00:14:40,180
And it's, of course, not because in this ones
240

240

00:14:40,180  -->  00:14:43,580
we specified the border specifically
241

241

00:14:43,580  -->  00:14:46,413
which we didn't do on this images.
242

242

00:14:47,754  -->  00:14:49,708
Actually, on this links.
243

243

00:14:49,708  -->  00:14:51,625
So, we need to fix that
244

244

00:14:53,208  -->  00:14:54,174
and it's quite easy.
245

245

00:14:54,174  -->  00:14:57,091
We just have to go down here to the
246

246

00:14:59,741  -->  00:15:02,074
How it Works section, right?
247

247

00:15:02,959  -->  00:15:04,292
And where is it?
248

248

00:15:09,865  -->  00:15:12,291
So down here we just create some code
249

249

00:15:12,291  -->  00:15:13,874
for the button-app,
250

250

00:15:16,447  -->  00:15:18,530
because, as you remember,
251

251

00:15:19,905  -->  00:15:21,738
this here is the class
252

252

00:15:22,598  -->  00:15:24,598
of the links button-app.
253

253

00:15:26,165  -->  00:15:27,665
So button-app link
254

254

00:15:29,556  -->  00:15:31,389
and button-app visited
255

255

00:15:35,963  -->  00:15:37,763
should have no border at all.
256

256

00:15:37,763  -->  00:15:39,346
So, border is zero.
257

257

00:15:41,153  -->  00:15:43,820
And this will solve our problem.
258

258

00:15:45,251  -->  00:15:47,918
Yeah, so the border disappeared.
259

259

00:15:50,767  -->  00:15:53,854
All right, so now we have five
260

260

00:15:53,854  -->  00:15:56,432
of our nine sections designed.
261

261

00:15:56,432  -->  00:15:58,266
So we already have more than half
262

262

00:15:58,266  -->  00:16:00,994
of our website completely built.
263

263

00:16:00,994  -->  00:16:02,655
All right, this is great.
264

264

00:16:02,655  -->  00:16:06,822
So, next up we have a customer testimonial section
265

265

00:16:08,009  -->  00:16:12,176
which will also be very beautiful as you will see.
