00:00:01,699  -->  00:00:04,670
<v Voiceover>Hi there. Over the last lectures,</v>
2

2

00:00:04,670  -->  00:00:07,020
together we build a beautiful website
3

3

00:00:07,020  -->  00:00:09,987
that you can be really proud of.
4

4

00:00:09,987  -->  00:00:13,181
It looks really great on a computer so far,
5

5

00:00:13,181  -->  00:00:15,562
but we also want it to look great
6

6

00:00:15,562  -->  00:00:19,702
on other devices with smaller screens, right?
7

7

00:00:19,702  -->  00:00:21,226
And as you know, this is where
8

8

00:00:21,226  -->  00:00:24,159
responsive web design comes in.
9

9

00:00:24,159  -->  00:00:28,877
So far, we built our entire layout with a fluid grid.
10

10

00:00:28,877  -->  00:00:31,755
And now it's time to take care of media queries
11

11

00:00:31,755  -->  00:00:34,562
to make our website truly responsive,
12

12

00:00:34,562  -->  00:00:37,562
to make it shine across all devices.
13

13

00:00:39,342  -->  00:00:41,170
So this is how our website will look
14

14

00:00:41,170  -->  00:00:44,082
on four different screen sizes.
15

15

00:00:44,082  -->  00:00:46,992
Basically, as the screen gets smaller,
16

16

00:00:46,992  -->  00:00:50,888
our content also gets smaller, and we have less white space,
17

17

00:00:50,888  -->  00:00:55,055
so that the website can be seen on a mobile phone or tablet.
18

18

00:00:56,874  -->  00:01:00,848
So, media queries are what will enable our website
19

19

00:01:00,848  -->  00:01:04,227
to call different CSS style declarations
20

20

00:01:04,227  -->  00:01:06,760
based on the current browser width
21

21

00:01:06,760  -->  00:01:11,528
or the width of a mobile device that displays our site.
22

22

00:01:11,528  -->  00:01:16,147
These media queries will trigger at different breakpoints.
23

23

00:01:16,147  -->  00:01:18,862
And breakpoints are screen width
24

24

00:01:18,862  -->  00:01:22,417
at which we want our website to change the way it looks
25

25

00:01:22,417  -->  00:01:25,660
in order to look good on all devices.
26

26

00:01:25,660  -->  00:01:30,129
The standard breakpoints are for tablet and for mobile.
27

27

00:01:30,129  -->  00:01:34,957
On this diagram here, you can see some possible breakpoints.
28

28

00:01:34,957  -->  00:01:37,268
And we will define our media queries
29

29

00:01:37,268  -->  00:01:40,153
for exactly those breakpoints.
30

30

00:01:40,153  -->  00:01:42,579
When you're just starting out, the easiest way
31

31

00:01:42,579  -->  00:01:45,980
to define breakpoints is to use device widths
32

32

00:01:45,980  -->  00:01:50,037
from popular devices, like the iPhone or the iPad.
33

33

00:01:50,037  -->  00:01:52,342
That is what we're going to do.
34

34

00:01:52,342  -->  00:01:55,138
However, once you got more experience,
35

35

00:01:55,138  -->  00:01:57,857
you should set your breakpoints simply at points
36

36

00:01:57,857  -->  00:02:02,850
where your design starts to look kind of terrible.
37

37

00:02:02,850  -->  00:02:06,341
So, now let's see how we can define those breakpoints
38

38

00:02:06,341  -->  00:02:08,508
with media queries in CSS.
39

39

00:02:11,299  -->  00:02:14,695
So the first thing I'm going to do is to create a new file
40

40

00:02:14,695  -->  00:02:17,612
where I will put the media queries.
41

41

00:02:18,866  -->  00:02:21,116
So hit new file and save it
42

42

00:02:24,168  -->  00:02:26,332
to our CSS folder.
43

43

00:02:26,332  -->  00:02:29,415
And I'm going to name it queries.css.
44

44

00:02:32,571  -->  00:02:35,948
Alright, so this is our CSS file.
45

45

00:02:35,948  -->  00:02:40,470
And now, let's start to put our media queries here.
46

46

00:02:40,470  -->  00:02:43,637
So, I will start with the smallest one
47

47

00:02:45,161  -->  00:02:46,820
and this is how we do it.
48

48

00:02:46,820  -->  00:02:49,320
So, media and then we say only
49

49

00:02:52,045  -->  00:02:52,878
screen
50

50

00:02:54,554  -->  00:02:57,221
and now we define our max-width.
51

51

00:03:00,375  -->  00:03:03,458
And we say this should be 480 pixels.
52

52

00:03:05,428  -->  00:03:09,595
And then all our styles go inside of this declaration block.
53

53

00:03:11,857  -->  00:03:15,391
So what this means is that these rules,
54

54

00:03:15,391  -->  00:03:17,407
which will come in here, will apply
55

55

00:03:17,407  -->  00:03:20,005
when the width of the device or the browser
56

56

00:03:20,005  -->  00:03:23,304
is less or equal than 480 pixels.
57

57

00:03:23,304  -->  00:03:27,086
And this is the width of the old iPhones,
58

58

00:03:27,086  -->  00:03:30,336
like the iPhone 5, iPhone 4, and so on.
59

59

00:03:31,260  -->  00:03:34,010
So I am actually going to put a comment in here
60

60

00:03:34,010  -->  00:03:37,876
to say that so that we can come here later
61

61

00:03:37,876  -->  00:03:40,459
and don't get lost in our code.
62

62

00:03:41,863  -->  00:03:44,113
So this is for small phones
63

63

00:03:47,041  -->  00:03:49,041
from zero to 480 pixels.
64

64

00:03:53,510  -->  00:03:54,427
Okay, next.
65

65

00:03:56,723  -->  00:03:59,508
We will make a media query
66

66

00:03:59,508  -->  00:04:01,508
for larger small phones.
67

67

00:04:04,305  -->  00:04:08,183
And let me just copy this, because kind of lazy here.
68

68

00:04:08,183  -->  00:04:11,548
Don't wanna write it all again.
69

69

00:04:11,548  -->  00:04:14,215
Okay and this will be 767 pixels
70

70

00:04:17,687  -->  00:04:21,847
and this, again, means that rules that will be
71

71

00:04:21,847  -->  00:04:26,470
in this block here will apply for all the browser widths
72

72

00:04:26,470  -->  00:04:29,053
which are less or equal to 767.
73

73

00:04:31,302  -->  00:04:35,469
And this value is because of the width of the iPad is 768.
74

74

00:04:39,430  -->  00:04:44,155
So we want this media query to target all the phones
75

75

00:04:44,155  -->  00:04:46,947
which are smaller than the iPad,
76

76

00:04:46,947  -->  00:04:50,801
and then the next media query will target the iPad
77

77

00:04:50,801  -->  00:04:53,584
and of course other tablets as well.
78

78

00:04:53,584  -->  00:04:55,191
I am just going with the iPad and iPhone,
79

79

00:04:55,191  -->  00:04:59,358
because, you know, those are the most popular devices.
80

80

00:05:01,225  -->  00:05:02,808
So I will say small
81

81

00:05:05,541  -->  00:05:06,374
phones to
82

82

00:05:08,791  -->  00:05:09,958
small tablets,
83

83

00:05:12,038  -->  00:05:13,854
cause you know there are maybe some tablets
84

84

00:05:13,854  -->  00:05:18,271
with 700 pixels width or something like that.
85

85

00:05:18,271  -->  00:05:20,251
So we target them as well here.
86

86

00:05:20,251  -->  00:05:22,084
So this means from 481
87

87

00:05:24,987  -->  00:05:26,737
to 767 pixels, right?
88

88

00:05:35,660  -->  00:05:37,077
So and now I will
89

89

00:05:39,380  -->  00:05:41,297
put another query here.
90

90

00:05:46,249  -->  00:05:47,499
And this one is
91

91

00:05:50,507  -->  00:05:51,340
1023.
92

92

00:05:52,838  -->  00:05:57,005
And so this will target the iPad in the portrait mode,
93

93

00:05:58,692  -->  00:06:00,442
which has 768 pixels.
94

94

00:06:02,373  -->  00:06:05,790
And again, the reason for this value here
95

95

00:06:06,671  -->  00:06:09,838
is that the iPad in the landscape view
96

96

00:06:11,054  -->  00:06:12,387
has 1024 pixels.
97

97

00:06:15,227  -->  00:06:18,695
So that will be in the next media query.
98

98

00:06:18,695  -->  00:06:21,326
So let me write it right here.
99

99

00:06:21,326  -->  00:06:25,076
So this goes from small tablet to big tablet.
100

100

00:06:30,775  -->  00:06:34,025
So, from 768 pixels, which is the iPad,
101

101

00:06:35,674  -->  00:06:36,924
to 1023 pixels.
102

102

00:06:44,215  -->  00:06:47,537
And now the last one, which will then target
103

103

00:06:47,537  -->  00:06:50,954
like, the iPad and all smaller computers.
104

104

00:06:54,567  -->  00:06:57,938
And I will define this as 1200,
105

105

00:06:57,938  -->  00:07:01,469
and the reason for this is that our row,
106

106

00:07:01,469  -->  00:07:05,636
that you surely remember, was defined as 1140 pixels.
107

107

00:07:07,989  -->  00:07:12,352
And so, I want the website to change its look
108

108

00:07:12,352  -->  00:07:15,102
when it gets close to that value,
109

109

00:07:16,034  -->  00:07:18,269
so that we always have some margins
110

110

00:07:18,269  -->  00:07:20,600
at the right and left side.
111

111

00:07:20,600  -->  00:07:22,003
But I will show you that in a moment,
112

112

00:07:22,003  -->  00:07:23,990
so don't worry about that right now.
113

113

00:07:23,990  -->  00:07:28,073
I will just say here that this is from big tablet
114

114

00:07:30,544  -->  00:07:31,794
to 1300 pixels,
115

115

00:07:34,500  -->  00:07:36,000
which is for width
116

116

00:07:38,480  -->  00:07:40,397
smaller than pixel row.
117

117

00:07:46,679  -->  00:07:50,846
Alright. So these are our media queries right here.
118

118

00:07:52,781  -->  00:07:56,963
In these media queries, we can then define all our styles.
119

119

00:07:56,963  -->  00:07:59,406
Let me just close this one here as well.
120

120

00:07:59,406  -->  00:08:00,323
This block.
121

121

00:08:01,171  -->  00:08:05,923
Alright, so in case that you're a little confused right now,
122

122

00:08:05,923  -->  00:08:09,987
just go back to the initial part of the video
123

123

00:08:09,987  -->  00:08:12,302
where I had that diagram.
124

124

00:08:12,302  -->  00:08:17,019
And there you can exactly see how these media queries work.
125

125

00:08:17,019  -->  00:08:21,852
That diagram does a really great job in explaining this.
126

126

00:08:21,852  -->  00:08:24,899
So one thing that I need to do right now
127

127

00:08:24,899  -->  00:08:28,030
as you can imagine, is to actually include
128

128

00:08:28,030  -->  00:08:30,968
this file here in our head.
129

129

00:08:30,968  -->  00:08:33,218
So I'll duplicate this line
130

130

00:08:35,204  -->  00:08:37,859
and then include the queries file,
131

131

00:08:37,859  -->  00:08:40,304
because if I wouldn't do this of course
132

132

00:08:40,304  -->  00:08:42,989
all of this wouldn't work.
133

133

00:08:42,989  -->  00:08:46,767
Also here in the head, I need to include another thing
134

134

00:08:46,767  -->  00:08:51,248
that is essential when you make responsive web design
135

135

00:08:51,248  -->  00:08:52,826
and it's this meta tag.
136

136

00:08:52,826  -->  00:08:56,929
We will talk about meta tags later in the course,
137

137

00:08:56,929  -->  00:09:00,346
but for now let's just put it right here.
138

138

00:09:01,190  -->  00:09:03,440
And we need a viewport one,
139

139

00:09:07,095  -->  00:09:10,095
and what we want to say here is that
140

140

00:09:11,315  -->  00:09:13,398
width equals device-width
141

141

00:09:17,319  -->  00:09:18,652
at initial-scale
142

142

00:09:21,290  -->  00:09:22,207
equals 1.0.
143

143

00:09:24,557  -->  00:09:27,969
So all that this will do is to tell mobile phones,
144

144

00:09:27,969  -->  00:09:32,289
for instance, that they should not zoom out the page.
145

145

00:09:32,289  -->  00:09:35,936
So that they should always start with the scale of one,
146

146

00:09:35,936  -->  00:09:38,968
which is exactly this here.
147

147

00:09:38,968  -->  00:09:40,763
And alright, now I think we're ready
148

148

00:09:40,763  -->  00:09:44,930
to start writing some CSS inside of those media queries.
149

149

00:09:46,584  -->  00:09:49,022
So how are we going to proceed now?
150

150

00:09:49,022  -->  00:09:52,664
We will basically for each breakpoint view the page
151

151

00:09:52,664  -->  00:09:56,587
and then fix everything that looks broken.
152

152

00:09:56,587  -->  00:10:00,337
So let's start to reduce the browser's width.
153

153

00:10:01,413  -->  00:10:06,288
So again, this is what it looks like in the normal way.
154

154

00:10:06,288  -->  00:10:09,464
And actually, the best thing to do now is
155

155

00:10:09,464  -->  00:10:12,425
to not use this live connection,
156

156

00:10:12,425  -->  00:10:14,889
but open the HTML file directly,
157

157

00:10:14,889  -->  00:10:18,399
because we will need the Google Chrome Developer Tools.
158

158

00:10:18,399  -->  00:10:19,899
So let me do that.
159

159

00:10:25,107  -->  00:10:26,475
And here we are.
160

160

00:10:26,475  -->  00:10:30,308
And the reason why we need the Developer Tools
161

161

00:10:31,598  -->  00:10:34,867
is actually because of this here.
162

162

00:10:34,867  -->  00:10:38,617
When we re-size the window, this shows us how
163

163

00:10:40,272  -->  00:10:42,189
the size of the window.
164

164

00:10:43,514  -->  00:10:47,347
So you remember our first breakpoint was 1200,
165

165

00:10:49,417  -->  00:10:50,584
which is here.
166

166

00:10:53,039  -->  00:10:56,786
And I will now show you why, 'cause imagine it wouldn't be
167

167

00:10:56,786  -->  00:10:57,777
then you see what happened
168

168

00:10:57,777  -->  00:10:59,931
to the text there on the left side?
169

169

00:10:59,931  -->  00:11:02,098
It just disappears, right?
170

170

00:11:05,308  -->  00:11:06,141
So
171

171

00:11:07,266  -->  00:11:11,349
1140 is the width of the row and of the text box,
172

172

00:11:13,485  -->  00:11:16,390
but then the text would be completely glued
173

173

00:11:16,390  -->  00:11:18,162
to the border of the browser
174

174

00:11:18,162  -->  00:11:21,329
and we don't want that, and also here.
175

175

00:11:22,622  -->  00:11:26,122
So that's why I chose the 1200 value here.
176

176

00:11:28,520  -->  00:11:31,603
So let's see what we can change here.
177

177

00:11:34,158  -->  00:11:37,995
So this box here is the hero text box.
178

178

00:11:37,995  -->  00:11:41,966
So let's go to the original definition
179

179

00:11:41,966  -->  00:11:44,216
of this in the header part.
180

180

00:11:46,065  -->  00:11:48,381
And let's see what we can do with this.
181

181

00:11:48,381  -->  00:11:52,548
So I will now go ahead and copy all of this into here.
182

182

00:11:55,841  -->  00:11:58,058
And then I will change the things
183

183

00:11:58,058  -->  00:12:00,308
that I want to change here.
184

184

00:12:02,354  -->  00:12:04,643
Now I don't want the width to be fixed anymore.
185

185

00:12:04,643  -->  00:12:07,226
I just want it to be 100%.
186

186

00:12:10,910  -->  00:12:13,599
So I don't want to change nothing of this
187

187

00:12:13,599  -->  00:12:15,844
and nothing of this.
188

188

00:12:15,844  -->  00:12:18,394
And in order to create some space then,
189

189

00:12:18,394  -->  00:12:21,869
between the text and the border of the browser,
190

190

00:12:21,869  -->  00:12:24,056
I will say that I want the padding
191

191

00:12:24,056  -->  00:12:26,928
to be zero on the top and the bottom
192

192

00:12:26,928  -->  00:12:31,178
and two percent on left and the right side.
193

193

00:12:31,178  -->  00:12:33,844
So now let's see what this looks like.
194

194

00:12:33,844  -->  00:12:35,078
We don't need to save it,
195

195

00:12:35,078  -->  00:12:38,623
because we have that auto save extension,
196

196

00:12:38,623  -->  00:12:39,997
but we will now have to reload this
197

197

00:12:39,997  -->  00:12:44,164
because we're no longer working with the live connection.
198

198

00:12:48,172  -->  00:12:50,962
So this is the 1200 limit.
199

199

00:12:50,962  -->  00:12:53,368
And let's see what happens.
200

200

00:12:53,368  -->  00:12:56,535
Okay. And this is kind of cool, right?
201

201

00:12:58,107  -->  00:12:59,940
Look at the text just.
202

202

00:13:01,259  -->  00:13:06,240
So now that effect that we had before no longer happens.
203

203

00:13:06,240  -->  00:13:07,999
So our width is 100%,
204

204

00:13:07,999  -->  00:13:12,484
and we can see that here in the Developer Tools.
205

205

00:13:12,484  -->  00:13:15,083
So we actually have that rule here
206

206

00:13:15,083  -->  00:13:17,186
and we see the width with 100%.
207

207

00:13:17,186  -->  00:13:21,560
Now if we make that bigger, then that rule goes away,
208

208

00:13:21,560  -->  00:13:25,310
because the media query does no longer apply.
209

209

00:13:26,421  -->  00:13:27,504
So very well.
210

210

00:13:35,055  -->  00:13:38,205
But what we see now here is that this text is still
211

211

00:13:38,205  -->  00:13:41,872
completely glued here to the browser border.
212

212

00:13:44,303  -->  00:13:47,058
And let me check that html.
213

213

00:13:47,058  -->  00:13:48,680
But I think it's inside of the row.
214

214

00:13:48,680  -->  00:13:50,430
Yeah, it actually is.
215

215

00:13:50,430  -->  00:13:52,172
So now I will define something
216

216

00:13:52,172  -->  00:13:55,089
for the row class and for all rows.
217

217

00:14:00,286  -->  00:14:04,735
And I'm going to say the same thing as I said up there.
218

218

00:14:04,735  -->  00:14:06,685
So I want the padding,
219

219

00:14:06,685  -->  00:14:08,153
and in order to make this look consistent
220

220

00:14:08,153  -->  00:14:10,986
I will use the same padding value.
221

221

00:14:11,989  -->  00:14:15,885
And I'm now going to format this a little bit different
222

222

00:14:15,885  -->  00:14:18,363
than from what I've done before,
223

223

00:14:18,363  -->  00:14:22,530
because every time we only have one declaration in a block
224

224

00:14:23,588  -->  00:14:27,171
we don't need to create all of those lines.
225

225

00:14:28,393  -->  00:14:31,726
And we should actually do the same here.
226

226

00:14:33,460  -->  00:14:37,627
Like here, for instance, but I'm not going to do that.
227

227

00:14:38,957  -->  00:14:41,040
But if you want to have a
228

228

00:14:44,710  -->  00:14:47,223
But if you want your code to look cleaner,
229

229

00:14:47,223  -->  00:14:51,064
then you should go ahead and do that.
230

230

00:14:51,064  -->  00:14:52,934
So again let's check that out.
231

231

00:14:52,934  -->  00:14:55,675
I'll refresh it, and now you saw that instantly
232

232

00:14:55,675  -->  00:14:59,842
that we now have this margin here, or this padding.
233

233

00:15:01,175  -->  00:15:03,737
And the same thing happens down here, actually,
234

234

00:15:03,737  -->  00:15:06,023
because all of these are rows.
235

235

00:15:06,023  -->  00:15:09,773
That's how we always have that distance here.
236

236

00:15:11,574  -->  00:15:13,052
Okay great.
237

237

00:15:13,052  -->  00:15:17,219
We actually see something really strange here happening.
238

238

00:15:18,722  -->  00:15:20,480
This because we opened the file now
239

239

00:15:20,480  -->  00:15:25,034
and not the browser connection so something changed.
240

240

00:15:25,034  -->  00:15:28,201
So let me change hello we're Omnifood.
241

241

00:15:29,459  -->  00:15:32,042
We see what's going wrong here.
242

242

00:15:32,939  -->  00:15:36,106
So it's this. We need to replace this.
243

243

00:15:46,610  -->  00:15:49,527
Alright. I think that's it for now.
244

244

00:15:50,821  -->  00:15:52,738
Here's also I'm hungry.
245

245

00:15:54,409  -->  00:15:55,984
Okay.
246

246

00:15:55,984  -->  00:15:58,567
So let's see what we have next.
247

247

00:15:59,647  -->  00:16:02,314
So this is our next media query,
248

248

00:16:03,340  -->  00:16:05,673
which goes from 768 to 1023.
249

249

00:16:09,172  -->  00:16:12,172
Let's check this out in the browser.
250

250

00:16:14,611  -->  00:16:18,778
Okay again, we need the Developer Tools to see the width.
251

251

00:16:21,238  -->  00:16:22,821
So let's go to 768.
252

252

00:16:25,835  -->  00:16:28,335
Okay, this will be our tablet.
253

253

00:16:29,479  -->  00:16:32,812
So let's see what we should change here.
254

254

00:16:34,038  -->  00:16:35,633
Actually, the first thing I'm going to do
255

255

00:16:35,633  -->  00:16:38,346
is to change the font-size.
256

256

00:16:38,346  -->  00:16:40,179
The overall font-size.
257

257

00:16:44,750  -->  00:16:45,583
So body
258

258

00:16:48,766  -->  00:16:49,599
font-size.
259

259

00:16:51,413  -->  00:16:53,956
And now it comes in very very handy
260

260

00:16:53,956  -->  00:16:56,368
that we defined all the font sizes
261

261

00:16:56,368  -->  00:16:59,747
across the entire web page in percentages,
262

262

00:16:59,747  -->  00:17:01,901
which means that all the font sizes
263

263

00:17:01,901  -->  00:17:05,284
are based on the base font size.
264

264

00:17:05,284  -->  00:17:09,451
So this was 20, and now I will make it down to 18 pixels.
265

265

00:17:11,147  -->  00:17:15,328
And now all the font sizes will automatically decrease
266

266

00:17:15,328  -->  00:17:17,828
and this is incredibly useful.
267

267

00:17:18,924  -->  00:17:22,792
And another thing that we should surely do,
268

268

00:17:22,792  -->  00:17:25,625
since we're now on smaller devices
269

269

00:17:26,600  -->  00:17:30,641
is to change the padding of the sections.
270

270

00:17:30,641  -->  00:17:34,097
And this was 80 pixels top and bottom
271

271

00:17:34,097  -->  00:17:37,180
and I will take it down to 60 pixels.
272

272

00:17:38,300  -->  00:17:42,467
Of course, I have to write the padding here, alright.
273

273

00:17:47,259  -->  00:17:49,342
So let me check this out.
274

274

00:17:51,741  -->  00:17:53,341
Re-size this.
275

275

00:17:53,341  -->  00:17:55,445
Okay, you see the text is smaller
276

276

00:17:55,445  -->  00:17:59,612
and I think it definitely looks more adequate to this device
277

277

00:18:01,489  -->  00:18:04,022
or to this browser width.
278

278

00:18:04,022  -->  00:18:07,858
And, yeah, we have less space between the sections,
279

279

00:18:07,858  -->  00:18:09,890
which also makes lot of sense.
280

280

00:18:09,890  -->  00:18:12,334
When you're on iPad, you don't wanna scroll
281

281

00:18:12,334  -->  00:18:16,501
through a website and see nothing but white space, right?
282

282

00:18:20,137  -->  00:18:22,387
So what else can we do now?
283

283

00:18:23,706  -->  00:18:27,539
For instance, this text here can be wider now.
284

284

00:18:30,120  -->  00:18:32,656
It looks kind of weird now.
285

285

00:18:32,656  -->  00:18:36,823
So you remember, let me check, it was the long copy class.
286

286

00:18:40,001  -->  00:18:42,918
Which is actually an overall class.
287

287

00:18:45,803  -->  00:18:47,360
Here it is.
288

288

00:18:47,360  -->  00:18:48,606
So let's change this.
289

289

00:18:48,606  -->  00:18:49,812
And again, I will copy of this
290

290

00:18:49,812  -->  00:18:53,895
and then change the things that I want to change.
291

291

00:18:56,698  -->  00:18:58,876
So line-height can stay the same,
292

292

00:18:58,876  -->  00:19:00,720
but width can now be 80%,
293

293

00:19:00,720  -->  00:19:03,529
and therefore the left margin needs to be 10,
294

294

00:19:03,529  -->  00:19:07,696
because 10 plus 10 makes 20, and 20 plus 80 makes the 100%.
295

295

00:19:11,916  -->  00:19:12,749
Alright.
296

296

00:19:14,709  -->  00:19:16,459
Save this, and great.
297

297

00:19:17,729  -->  00:19:20,511
So again, this is now really designing in the browser.
298

298

00:19:20,511  -->  00:19:21,725
We're gonna check everything
299

299

00:19:21,725  -->  00:19:25,892
and see which doesn't look right, and then fix it.
300

300

00:19:28,702  -->  00:19:32,074
So now that you know how to work with media queries,
301

301

00:19:32,074  -->  00:19:34,584
and build truly responsive websites
302

302

00:19:34,584  -->  00:19:38,457
let's take a small break and continue with what we're doing
303

303

00:19:38,457  -->  00:19:40,124
in the next lecture.
