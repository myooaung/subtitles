00:00:02,046  -->  00:00:04,775
<v Voiceover>Welcome to the last work section.</v>
2

2

00:00:04,775  -->  00:00:07,297
We have come such a long way so far.
3

3

00:00:07,297  -->  00:00:09,375
Our website looks super great
4

4

00:00:09,375  -->  00:00:11,906
and has some cool animations.
5

5

00:00:11,906  -->  00:00:13,585
Now in this section, we'll do some
6

6

00:00:13,585  -->  00:00:15,741
optimizations on our web page,
7

7

00:00:15,741  -->  00:00:17,646
and then I will show you how you can
8

8

00:00:17,646  -->  00:00:21,063
launch your own websites to the internet.
9

9

00:00:22,417  -->  00:00:25,487
But before doing that, let's add a final touch
10

10

00:00:25,487  -->  00:00:30,112
before we make our webpage ready for launch, a favicon.
11

11

00:00:30,112  -->  00:00:32,839
Favicons are those little icons you see
12

12

00:00:32,839  -->  00:00:36,807
on browser tabs and on your bookmarks bar.
13

13

00:00:36,807  -->  00:00:39,796
It is part of the identity of any website
14

14

00:00:39,796  -->  00:00:42,452
and makes users recognize your website.
15

15

00:00:42,452  -->  00:00:44,733
So don't skip this step.
16

16

00:00:44,733  -->  00:00:48,324
There is a very easy, online tool to do this.
17

17

00:00:48,324  -->  00:00:51,507
We just need an image to serve as our icon.
18

18

00:00:51,507  -->  00:00:53,993
So, let's do that for now.
19

19

00:00:53,993  -->  00:00:56,029
So this is the tool I was talking about,
20

20

00:00:56,029  -->  00:00:58,529
so it's the Favicon Generator.
21

21

00:00:59,379  -->  00:01:02,529
And with this we can create icons for the browser,
22

22

00:01:02,529  -->  00:01:04,894
of course, for the iOS home screen,
23

23

00:01:04,894  -->  00:01:09,221
for Android home screen, and for Windows 8,
24

24

00:01:09,221  -->  00:01:11,872
and, yeah, for Windows in general.
25

25

00:01:11,872  -->  00:01:15,423
So, we just need to pick our image.
26

26

00:01:15,423  -->  00:01:18,756
In this case, I'm going to use the logo.
27

27

00:01:23,307  -->  00:01:25,101
And the black one of course, so I'm going to
28

28

00:01:25,101  -->  00:01:28,018
use this one to create the favicon.
29

29

00:01:31,950  -->  00:01:33,200
And here we go.
30

30

00:01:34,362  -->  00:01:37,138
So the first icon here is actually for iOS,
31

31

00:01:37,138  -->  00:01:39,834
and since ours is transparent,
32

32

00:01:39,834  -->  00:01:42,782
we'll need to add a background color,
33

33

00:01:42,782  -->  00:01:45,185
which will be white.
34

34

00:01:45,185  -->  00:01:48,352
And then we have Android here as well.
35

35

00:01:49,355  -->  00:01:52,744
And I will also add this white color.
36

36

00:01:52,744  -->  00:01:55,994
And this is not so important, actually.
37

37

00:01:57,102  -->  00:02:00,215
What really matters is down here.
38

38

00:02:00,215  -->  00:02:01,382
And we go now,
39

39

00:02:02,631  -->  00:02:04,415
click here because we want to
40

40

00:02:04,415  -->  00:02:08,459
choose a path where we're going to put our icons,
41

41

00:02:08,459  -->  00:02:11,561
because we don't want them in the root,
42

42

00:02:11,561  -->  00:02:14,419
so in the main project folder.
43

43

00:02:14,419  -->  00:02:16,836
So let me check what this is.
44

44

00:02:19,749  -->  00:02:22,796
So I want them here, then in the Resources,
45

45

00:02:22,796  -->  00:02:25,647
and I'll actually create a folder for them here,
46

46

00:02:25,647  -->  00:02:26,480
Icons
47

47

00:02:28,136  -->  00:02:29,053
or Favicons
48

48

00:02:30,996  -->  00:02:34,413
and so, it's Resources and then Favicons.
49

49

00:02:37,744  -->  00:02:39,327
So I want Resources
50

50

00:02:41,602  -->  00:02:43,102
and then Favicons.
51

51

00:02:45,484  -->  00:02:48,422
So this is where we'll put the icons.
52

52

00:02:48,422  -->  00:02:50,755
And then, let's generate it.
53

53

00:02:54,052  -->  00:02:58,013
Okay, so we just download this and we grab
54

54

00:02:58,013  -->  00:03:01,930
this code here, and insert it into our website.
55

55

00:03:06,414  -->  00:03:09,664
So let's just paste off this down here.
56

56

00:03:15,460  -->  00:03:18,960
It's a lot of code, but well, don't worry.
57

57

00:03:22,681  -->  00:03:25,664
And now we just need to put this stuff
58

58

00:03:25,664  -->  00:03:27,831
into our folder, actually.
59

59

00:03:29,494  -->  00:03:30,744
And here it is.
60

60

00:03:34,521  -->  00:03:35,604
So, Favicons.
61

61

00:03:43,537  -->  00:03:46,027
All right, so, put them into Resources
62

62

00:03:46,027  -->  00:03:48,598
and we can replace that folder we had
63

63

00:03:48,598  -->  00:03:50,845
because it has the same name.
64

64

00:03:50,845  -->  00:03:53,428
And so, here are all our icons.
65

65

00:03:58,311  -->  00:04:00,311
So let's check this out.
66

66

00:04:04,517  -->  00:04:09,290
So the icon is not showing up here as it should.
67

67

00:04:09,290  -->  00:04:10,473
And I actually don't know why,
68

68

00:04:10,473  -->  00:04:12,876
but I'm sure that it is working
69

69

00:04:12,876  -->  00:04:16,876
on your computer, because as we can see in here,
70

70

00:04:18,187  -->  00:04:21,437
everything is working fine, supposedly.
71

71

00:04:23,897  -->  00:04:27,777
Which means that the images are in the correct place
72

72

00:04:27,777  -->  00:04:32,637
and, yeah, this code, of course, is also correct.
73

73

00:04:32,637  -->  00:04:35,496
So I don't know why it doesn't appear here in my case,
74

74

00:04:35,496  -->  00:04:39,256
but probably on your computer it will appear.
75

75

00:04:39,256  -->  00:04:42,072
So, okay, now you know how to add
76

76

00:04:42,072  -->  00:04:46,438
that special touch to your website as well.
77

77

00:04:46,438  -->  00:04:48,475
Now, I could just have stopped here
78

78

00:04:48,475  -->  00:04:50,841
and then launched our website or show you
79

79

00:04:50,841  -->  00:04:52,959
how to launch your website.
80

80

00:04:52,959  -->  00:04:55,037
But I want to show you even more.
81

81

00:04:55,037  -->  00:04:57,811
I want our website to be perfect,
82

82

00:04:57,811  -->  00:05:00,421
and so every detail matters.
83

83

00:05:00,421  -->  00:05:02,463 line:15% 
So, let's now optimize our website's
84

84

00:05:02,463  -->  00:05:05,046
page speed in the next lecture.
