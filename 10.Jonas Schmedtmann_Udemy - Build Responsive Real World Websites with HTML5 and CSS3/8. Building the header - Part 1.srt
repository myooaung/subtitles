<v Voiceover>Hi there. Let's build the first section</v>
2

2

00:00:04,866  -->  00:00:07,116 line:15% 
of our project, the header.
3

3

00:00:08,697  -->  00:00:11,398
So this is the sketch for the header,
4

4

00:00:11,398  -->  00:00:14,658
as I've showed you before, and on the right side
5

5

00:00:14,658  -->  00:00:19,359
is the final result that we'll get after this lecture.
6

6

00:00:19,359  -->  00:00:22,698
So we have a nice headline and two buttons in the middle,
7

7

00:00:22,698  -->  00:00:26,439
and at the upper part we have the Omnifood logo,
8

8

00:00:26,439  -->  00:00:29,449
and the Navigation on the right side.
9

9

00:00:29,449  -->  00:00:31,866
It looks really great, right?
10

10

00:00:33,454  -->  00:00:37,350
So, this is what we'll learn in this section.
11

11

00:00:37,350  -->  00:00:40,388
I think it is a good idea to tell you in each
12

12

00:00:40,388  -->  00:00:43,337
of the following lectures, all the new things that
13

13

00:00:43,337  -->  00:00:46,278
you're going to learn in that lecture.
14

14

00:00:46,278  -->  00:00:50,258
This way when you want to review these lectures someday,
15

15

00:00:50,258  -->  00:00:54,759
it will be easier for you to find what you're looking for.
16

16

00:00:54,759  -->  00:00:58,770
Also, you'll get a feeling of what you will achieve
17

17

00:00:58,770  -->  00:01:00,979
after each lecture.
18

18

00:01:00,979  -->  00:01:04,990
Now, this is the first lecture in which we will actually
19

19

00:01:04,990  -->  00:01:09,157
build our website, and there is already so much to learn.
20

20

00:01:11,087  -->  00:01:14,078
We'll meet new HTML elements such as
21

21

00:01:14,078  -->  00:01:16,078
header, nav, ul, and li.
22

22

00:01:18,804  -->  00:01:22,647
We'll learn how to make a background image darker in CSS
23

23

00:01:22,647  -->  00:01:25,147
so that we can put text on it.
24

24

00:01:26,047  -->  00:01:29,738
We will learn how to make that image exactly as high as
25

25

00:01:29,738  -->  00:01:33,719
the browser viewport, and then we'll make
26

26

00:01:33,719  -->  00:01:36,786
a vertically and horizontally centered box,
27

27

00:01:36,786  -->  00:01:39,536
with some text and buttons in it.
28

28

00:01:40,505  -->  00:01:44,145
And we'll actually design those buttons as well.
29

29

00:01:44,145  -->  00:01:48,156
Then we'll learn the best way to style links in CSS.
30

30

00:01:48,156  -->  00:01:51,796
And we'll even make a simple CSS3 animation
31

31

00:01:51,796  -->  00:01:53,807
with these buttons.
32

32

00:01:53,807  -->  00:01:57,474
And finally, we'll make a simple navigation.
33

33

00:01:58,515  -->  00:02:01,577
So let's waste no more time, and go straight back
34

34

00:02:01,577  -->  00:02:02,577
to brackets.
35

35

00:02:04,465  -->  00:02:07,675
And so, this is how we left our HTML document
36

36

00:02:07,675  -->  00:02:09,592
after the last lecture.
37

37

00:02:10,874  -->  00:02:14,115
We'll delete this, you don't need it anymore.
38

38

00:02:14,115  -->  00:02:17,954
And now we want to start building our header.
39

39

00:02:17,954  -->  00:02:22,115
And HTML actually has a nice element for us,
40

40

00:02:22,115  -->  00:02:26,695
called exactly header, and this is where we will put
41

41

00:02:26,695  -->  00:02:30,194
the logo, the navigation, the hero image,
42

42

00:02:30,194  -->  00:02:32,368
the main heading, and those buttons
43

43

00:02:32,368  -->  00:02:35,618
that I showed you in the images before.
44

44

00:02:36,856  -->  00:02:39,482
Now the header element works basically like
45

45

00:02:39,482  -->  00:02:42,414
a usual div element, which means that it's
46

46

00:02:42,414  -->  00:02:45,734
a container, to put some content.
47

47

00:02:45,734  -->  00:02:47,882
There are other elements like that,
48

48

00:02:47,882  -->  00:02:50,311
like nav for navigation,
49

49

00:02:50,311  -->  00:02:52,641
the footer element for the footer,
50

50

00:02:52,641  -->  00:02:57,443
the main element for the main content, et cetera.
51

51

00:02:57,443  -->  00:03:00,490
By using the header element instead of a simple div,
52

52

00:03:00,490  -->  00:03:03,439
we tell search engines such as Google
53

53

00:03:03,439  -->  00:03:07,606
this is our header and not some div element with no meaning,
54

54

00:03:09,180  -->  00:03:12,347
so this gives our container a meaning.
55

55

00:03:13,499  -->  00:03:16,999
So let's start by create the HTML
56

56

00:03:16,999  -->  00:03:20,249
that we will then later style with CSS,
57

57

00:03:21,421  -->  00:03:24,470
and for that we need our content.
58

58

00:03:24,470  -->  00:03:26,540
I hope you already downloaded it,
59

59

00:03:26,540  -->  00:03:29,738
I have it here on my desktop, so let's
60

60

00:03:29,738  -->  00:03:32,321
just put it here, and unzip it.
61

61

00:03:33,797  -->  00:03:37,342
Alright, down here we have the content.
62

62

00:03:37,342  -->  00:03:40,739
I made three files which have exactly the same content,
63

63

00:03:40,739  -->  00:03:44,906
one for Microsoft Word, one for the Mac app Pages,
64

64

00:03:45,798  -->  00:03:50,229
and if you don't have any of those just use this file.
65

65

00:03:50,229  -->  00:03:54,229
I will open this one, and so this is the content
66

66

00:03:55,427  -->  00:03:58,094
that we will put on our webpage.
67

67

00:03:59,878  -->  00:04:01,840
And we're here at Section 0 which is
68

68

00:04:01,840  -->  00:04:05,486
the header with hero image and navigation.
69

69

00:04:05,486  -->  00:04:08,989
And that's our headline, and I will just copy it
70

70

00:04:08,989  -->  00:04:11,778
because we will need it in a minute.
71

71

00:04:11,778  -->  00:04:12,861
So back here.
72

72

00:04:14,525  -->  00:04:19,077
As I told you, we will have a vertically and horizontally
73

73

00:04:19,077  -->  00:04:23,077
centered container, where that headline will be.
74

74

00:04:24,009  -->  00:04:28,176
So let's first make a div element for that container,
75

75

00:04:30,319  -->  00:04:33,652
and I will call it hero-text-box because
76

76

00:04:37,119  -->  00:04:41,286
this is a text box which floats over the hero image,
77

77

00:04:43,477  -->  00:04:46,310
which is the big background image.
78

78

00:04:48,206  -->  00:04:52,373
Alright, so this will be the box that we will center
79

79

00:04:53,478  -->  00:04:55,811
in a minute, using some CSS.
80

80

00:04:57,558  -->  00:05:01,725
Now that, my heading that we just copied, and here it is.
81

81

00:05:05,751  -->  00:05:08,609
And now we want some buttons,
82

82

00:05:08,609  -->  00:05:11,961
and for buttons we use the link element
83

83

00:05:11,961  -->  00:05:14,699
that we will then style with CSS
84

84

00:05:14,699  -->  00:05:18,449
to make them look like nice designed buttons.
85

85

00:05:19,376  -->  00:05:22,710
So we need the href attribute, and since we don't have
86

86

00:05:22,710  -->  00:05:25,465
anywhere to point at this moment,
87

87

00:05:25,465  -->  00:05:30,239
so we have no document where we want to link to,
88

88

00:05:30,239  -->  00:05:34,639
we put a dummy link, and that's usually made
89

89

00:05:34,639  -->  00:05:36,556
using this hash symbol.
90

90

00:05:37,649  -->  00:05:40,816
So this link points nowhere right now.
91

91

00:05:41,652  -->  00:05:45,569
So let me just get this text, it is I'm hungry,
92

92

00:05:47,270  -->  00:05:51,849
and this button will later take us all the way down
93

93

00:05:51,849  -->  00:05:54,291
to the sign up section.
94

94

00:05:54,291  -->  00:05:58,520
And the second button will be Show me more.
95

95

00:05:58,520  -->  00:06:02,990
So in this one, I'm just copying it here, is I'm hungry,
96

96

00:06:02,990  -->  00:06:05,460
and now I duplicate it as I've showed you before
97

97

00:06:05,460  -->  00:06:08,830
with Command + D, or Ctrl + D,
98

98

00:06:08,830  -->  00:06:11,330
and in here goes Show me more.
99

99

00:06:15,510  -->  00:06:19,677
Alright, so now let's style the whole thing using CSS.
100

100

00:06:21,650  -->  00:06:24,983
But first, let's see what it looks like.
101

101

00:06:26,512  -->  00:06:30,679
Alright, so this is what we just put on our HTML file.
102

102

00:06:32,849  -->  00:06:34,766
So let's style it here.
103

103

00:06:37,755  -->  00:06:41,184
Add a new rule here for the header,
104

104

00:06:41,184  -->  00:06:43,225
and the first thing that we're going to do
105

105

00:06:43,225  -->  00:06:46,326
is to set the background image,
106

106

00:06:46,326  -->  00:06:50,493
and in order to do that let's go back to our folder.
107

107

00:06:54,677  -->  00:06:56,926
And we have the Omnifood contents,
108

108

00:06:56,926  -->  00:07:00,759
and the background image that Omnifood gave us
109

109

00:07:01,623  -->  00:07:04,615
is called hero, this hero image.
110

110

00:07:04,615  -->  00:07:08,075
So this is the image that we will use
111

111

00:07:08,075  -->  00:07:10,075
as our background image.
112

112

00:07:11,856  -->  00:07:16,646
I actually got this image from one of the resources
113

113

00:07:16,646  -->  00:07:19,896
that you can find in the course e-book.
114

114

00:07:23,150  -->  00:07:26,856
So you probably already know where to put this,
115

115

00:07:26,856  -->  00:07:31,302
it's in the resources folder, css, and then images,
116

116

00:07:31,302  -->  00:07:34,132
because it's a background image,
117

117

00:07:34,132  -->  00:07:38,299
and we will use it in a CSS file from the CSS file.
118

118

00:07:42,164  -->  00:07:44,914
So now how do we use this in CSS?
119

119

00:07:47,615  -->  00:07:49,133
It's quite simple.
120

120

00:07:49,133  -->  00:07:53,050
Just say background-image, and then we use URL,
121

121

00:07:58,235  -->  00:08:00,485
img, and then the hero.jpg.
122

122

00:08:02,783  -->  00:08:04,533
So this is our image.
123

123

00:08:06,095  -->  00:08:08,762
Very easy to incorporate, right?
124

124

00:08:12,004  -->  00:08:15,312
We can even see if that's the correct image,
125

125

00:08:15,312  -->  00:08:17,200
and yeah it is.
126

126

00:08:17,200  -->  00:08:20,593
So let's see how this looks like.
127

127

00:08:20,593  -->  00:08:23,913
Alright, now the problem that you see is that
128

128

00:08:23,913  -->  00:08:28,080
the image only fills the part that has some content here,
129

129

00:08:29,801  -->  00:08:34,364
so what we want to do now is to make this header
130

130

00:08:34,364  -->  00:08:37,454
as high as the viewport, which means from here
131

131

00:08:37,454  -->  00:08:39,793
all the way down here.
132

132

00:08:39,793  -->  00:08:43,960
So we want to fill the whole viewport with the image.
133

133

00:08:47,642  -->  00:08:51,809
So we need to set the height of the header element.
134

134

00:08:53,284  -->  00:08:55,110
And how do we do that?
135

135

00:08:55,110  -->  00:08:58,772
There's a simple trick which is this one.
136

136

00:08:58,772  -->  00:09:02,439
We just set it to 100 view H, and this means
137

137

00:09:05,241  -->  00:09:08,491
it's 100% of the viewport.
138

138

00:09:08,491  -->  00:09:09,842
Very simple.
139

139

00:09:09,842  -->  00:09:13,543
So let's see if it worked. Alright.
140

140

00:09:13,543  -->  00:09:16,543
Now the image looks like we want it.
141

141

00:09:17,853  -->  00:09:21,411
Now we have some problem here, which is this wide space here
142

142

00:09:21,411  -->  00:09:23,411
and I will tell you why this happens.
143

143

00:09:23,411  -->  00:09:27,701
This is pretty annoying, it's because of this h1 element
144

144

00:09:27,701  -->  00:09:28,784
which has a--
145

145

00:09:29,742  -->  00:09:33,909
I will tell you this, using the Chrome Developer Tools
146

146

00:09:34,833  -->  00:09:37,102
as I've showed you before.
147

147

00:09:37,102  -->  00:09:39,491
Let me just show this quickly,
148

148

00:09:39,491  -->  00:09:42,408
so as you see with the orange bars,
149

149

00:09:43,912  -->  00:09:46,995
this has some margin, top and bottom.
150

150

00:09:48,103  -->  00:09:52,020
And this is because of the normalized CSS file.
151

151

00:09:54,422  -->  00:09:57,112
So we have to get rid of that
152

152

00:09:57,112  -->  00:09:59,695
before we can do anything else.
153

153

00:10:02,601  -->  00:10:06,601
This is really annoying, so let me just margin 0
154

154

00:10:10,031  -->  00:10:12,198
and now it should be gone.
155

155

00:10:14,141  -->  00:10:16,762
Now the image doesn't look quite as we want it right,
156

156

00:10:16,762  -->  00:10:20,530
because it's way too zoomed in, so we have to tell
157

157

00:10:20,530  -->  00:10:24,697
the browser in some way that we want to see the whole image
158

158

00:10:26,282  -->  00:10:29,699
and we do this using the background-size.
159

159

00:10:32,695  -->  00:10:35,528
Background-size, and we say cover.
160

160

00:10:39,166  -->  00:10:43,249
And also we want to have the background centered,
161

161

00:10:45,006  -->  00:10:48,173
so we use background-position: center.
162

162

00:10:54,511  -->  00:10:57,678
And that's much nicer, very very good.
163

163

00:10:59,936  -->  00:11:03,333
Now if we would re-size this window,
164

164

00:11:03,333  -->  00:11:06,586
it will always find a way to let us see
165

165

00:11:06,586  -->  00:11:07,753
all the image.
166

166

00:11:10,025  -->  00:11:13,608
So now let's find a way to center this box,
167

167

00:11:15,392  -->  00:11:18,086
which has this title and those buttons
168

168

00:11:18,086  -->  00:11:20,503
that we'll style in a minute.
169

169

00:11:22,886  -->  00:11:26,636
So this is called, let me see, hero-text-box.
170

170

00:11:29,327  -->  00:11:32,827
We'll copy it actually, and paste it here.
171

171

00:11:35,245  -->  00:11:37,532
So how do we do this?
172

172

00:11:37,532  -->  00:11:42,255
We will actually not use the responsive fluid grid
173

173

00:11:42,255  -->  00:11:45,337
that we set up before, because we want this box
174

174

00:11:45,337  -->  00:11:48,254
to be an absolutely positioned box.
175

175

00:11:52,405  -->  00:11:55,177
Because that's the only way we can vertically
176

176

00:11:55,177  -->  00:11:57,427
and horizontally center it.
177

177

00:11:59,136  -->  00:12:02,386
And I will assign the width of the row,
178

178

00:12:04,145  -->  00:12:07,228
which is if you remember 1140 pixels.
179

179

00:12:09,930  -->  00:12:14,097
So this will look like a row because it has the same width,
180

180

00:12:15,115  -->  00:12:18,745
but it will be absolutely positioned.
181

181

00:12:18,745  -->  00:12:21,328
And in order to do that, we say
182

182

00:12:24,341  -->  00:12:27,091
we want it 50% from the top,
183

183

00:12:31,127  -->  00:12:33,377
and 50% from the left.
184

184

00:12:35,957  -->  00:12:38,790
So let's see what this looks like.
185

185

00:12:41,146  -->  00:12:45,604
So 50% from the left, and 50% from the top,
186

186

00:12:45,604  -->  00:12:48,945
okay but this looks weird right?
187

187

00:12:48,945  -->  00:12:52,028
So we have to use a little trick here
188

188

00:12:56,243  -->  00:12:59,326
which is with the transform property,
189

189

00:13:01,167  -->  00:13:05,334
and we use translate and then -50%, -50%,
190

190

00:13:12,484  -->  00:13:16,317
and what this does is to translate the element
191

191

00:13:17,625  -->  00:13:21,792
half of its width and of its height, up and to the left.
192

192

00:13:28,552  -->  00:13:32,719
So now it is centered, it's nicely centered as you want.
193

193

00:13:36,954  -->  00:13:40,121
So it always stays in the middle here.
194

194

00:13:41,044  -->  00:13:43,006
Now as you can see the contrast between
195

195

00:13:43,006  -->  00:13:45,984
the text and the image is way too low.
196

196

00:13:45,984  -->  00:13:49,406
For example right here, we have a very hard time
197

197

00:13:49,406  -->  00:13:50,715
to see anything.
198

198

00:13:50,715  -->  00:13:54,514
And that's what we learned right in the first section,
199

199

00:13:54,514  -->  00:13:58,514
in the web design section, that it is a bad idea
200

200

00:13:59,591  -->  00:14:01,733
to just put text on image.
201

201

00:14:01,733  -->  00:14:04,505
And we're gonna use one of the solutions,
202

202

00:14:04,505  -->  00:14:07,672
which is simply make the image darker,
203

203

00:14:08,953  -->  00:14:12,173
so let's see how we can do that.
204

204

00:14:12,173  -->  00:14:14,382
So a little trick that we use here,
205

205

00:14:14,382  -->  00:14:17,713
looks like we'll put a linear gradient
206

206

00:14:17,713  -->  00:14:19,380
on top of the image.
207

207

00:14:21,132  -->  00:14:23,554
So this is like using two background images
208

208

00:14:23,554  -->  00:14:24,971
at the same time.
209

209

00:14:25,823  -->  00:14:27,974
So we have this linear gradient,
210

210

00:14:27,974  -->  00:14:31,641
and the image that we just specified before.
211

211

00:14:32,734  -->  00:14:35,651
And in here, we can say two colors.
212

212

00:14:37,564  -->  00:14:41,731
Let me start with black so that you can get the idea,
213

213

00:14:44,151  -->  00:14:46,210
and since we don't want a gradient actually,
214

214

00:14:46,210  -->  00:14:50,423
we want just a color, we make it from black to black
215

215

00:14:50,423  -->  00:14:53,423
so from one color to the same color.
216

216

00:14:54,731  -->  00:14:57,965
Since we don't want a complete black,
217

217

00:14:57,965  -->  00:15:00,382
we use the transparency here.
218

218

00:15:04,306  -->  00:15:07,806
And let's put it to 70% transparency,
219

219

00:15:11,346  -->  00:15:15,544
so as we saw before when we use transparency
220

220

00:15:15,544  -->  00:15:18,377
it changes here to this rgba code.
221

221

00:15:23,292  -->  00:15:26,542
So I will just put the same thing here,
222

222

00:15:28,983  -->  00:15:33,150
and now we have this nice 70% transparent black color
223

223

00:15:34,434  -->  00:15:37,267
which is on top of the hero image.
224

224

00:15:40,410  -->  00:15:43,783
And this is how it looks, much better right?
225

225

00:15:43,783  -->  00:15:47,614
Okay, so I think the background image here
226

226

00:15:47,614  -->  00:15:52,113
is now formatted, so let's end the first part
227

227

00:15:52,113  -->  00:15:55,299
of building our header right here.
228

228

00:15:55,299  -->  00:15:58,173
In the next video we'll start to format
229

229

00:15:58,173  -->  00:16:02,006
the main heading here, and these two buttons.
