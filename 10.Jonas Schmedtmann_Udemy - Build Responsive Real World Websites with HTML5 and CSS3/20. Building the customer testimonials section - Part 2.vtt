00:00:00.971  -->  00:00:02.360 line:15% 
<v Voiceover>Hello, and welcome back</v>
2

2

00:00:02.360  -->  00:00:05.866 line:15% 
to building the customer testimonial section.
3

3

00:00:05.866  -->  00:00:08.049 line:15% 
This is getting easier and easier.
4

4

00:00:08.049  -->  00:00:10.203 line:15% 
Don't you think so?
5

5

00:00:10.203  -->  00:00:13.934 line:15% 
So, let's have some more fun with CSS.
6

6

00:00:13.934  -->  00:00:18.188
So, this is where we left our website in the last lecture
7

7

00:00:18.188  -->  00:00:22.535
and now, let's start by adding a beautiful background image
8

8

00:00:22.535  -->  00:00:26.452
that is actually in the folder of our contents.
9

9

00:00:27.940  -->  00:00:31.638
In our project folder, so right here.
10

10

00:00:31.638  -->  00:00:34.807
So, it will be a background image.
11

11

00:00:34.807  -->  00:00:37.724
So, this image, right now, is here.
12

12

00:00:39.094  -->  00:00:41.634
It is called back customers,
13

13

00:00:41.634  -->  00:00:43.889
but since it will be a background image
14

14

00:00:43.889  -->  00:00:47.424
it should be here inside our CSS folder.
15

15

00:00:47.424  -->  00:00:50.289
So as you remember, all our background images
16

16

00:00:50.289  -->  00:00:52.872
go right here into this folder.
17

17

00:00:54.149  -->  00:00:57.399
So, now we are ready to use that image.
18

18

00:00:58.700  -->  00:01:01.533
So, let's go back to our CSS file.
19

19

00:01:02.398  -->  00:01:05.231
Let's create some space down here.
20

20

00:01:09.266  -->  00:01:12.266
You are already used to this by now.
21

21

00:01:20.156  -->  00:01:24.156
Let's start to define the code for this section.
22

22

00:01:26.292  -->  00:01:28.042
Section testimonials.
23

23

00:01:30.315  -->  00:01:34.482
So, let's start by defining again a background image.
24

24

00:01:35.417  -->  00:01:36.750
Background image
25

25

00:01:39.156  -->  00:01:43.323
and this is how we do it again and make customers.
26

26

00:01:45.917  -->  00:01:49.899
Alright, so as before, we want this image to fill
27

27

00:01:49.899  -->  00:01:51.849
the whole width of the browser,
28

28

00:01:51.849  -->  00:01:52.682
so we say
29

29

00:01:54.023  -->  00:01:54.856
background
30

30

00:01:56.909  -->  00:01:57.742
size
31

31

00:01:58.635  -->  00:01:59.468
cover.
32

32

00:02:00.464  -->  00:02:03.410
So, this is probably what you will always want to do
33

33

00:02:03.410  -->  00:02:04.670
with your images.
34

34

00:02:04.670  -->  00:02:07.420
So, let's see the result of this.
35

35

00:02:10.338  -->  00:02:13.171
Alright, so this is way too bright
36

36

00:02:15.844  -->  00:02:19.075
and it's the same situation as we had before
37

37

00:02:19.075  -->  00:02:21.066
on our header section.
38

38

00:02:21.066  -->  00:02:25.637
So, we will once again make this image darker
39

39

00:02:25.637  -->  00:02:28.543
and I hope you remember how we did that.
40

40

00:02:28.543  -->  00:02:32.139
So, it's like setting multiple backgrounds here.
41

41

00:02:32.139  -->  00:02:36.139
So, we have a gradient with a blank opaque color
42

42

00:02:37.097  -->  00:02:39.514
and then the customer images.
43

43

00:02:41.221  -->  00:02:44.289
So, we create a linear gradient
44

44

00:02:44.289  -->  00:02:48.122
so as before, I will start with complete black
45

45

00:02:49.795  -->  00:02:52.903
and then change it with the color picker
46

46

00:02:52.903  -->  00:02:53.986
and command E
47

47

00:02:57.495  -->  00:03:00.578
and let's set this to say 80 percent.
48

48

00:03:05.216  -->  00:03:08.716
Enter the same exact thing, so 80 percent.
49

49

00:03:12.307  -->  00:03:16.208
This looks probably way better by now.
50

50

00:03:16.208  -->  00:03:17.041
Right.
51

51

00:03:18.950  -->  00:03:21.104
So now what we have to do is of course,
52

52

00:03:21.104  -->  00:03:24.521
to make all the text inside of this white
53

53

00:03:25.533  -->  00:03:29.069
and then, believe me it will look great.
54

54

00:03:29.069  -->  00:03:31.152
So, color and color white
55

55

00:03:34.473  -->  00:03:36.056
and let's check it.
56

56

00:03:38.150  -->  00:03:39.983
Okay, this looks cool.
57

57

00:03:40.954  -->  00:03:43.839
Now, I want to show you a very cool effect
58

58

00:03:43.839  -->  00:03:48.756
that you can achieve with background images in CSS
59

59

00:03:48.756  -->  00:03:51.756
and I'm talking about this property.
60

60

00:03:52.888  -->  00:03:55.138
It is background attachment
61

61

00:03:56.403  -->  00:03:58.653
and if we set this to fixed
62

62

00:03:59.613  -->  00:04:03.778
then let me show you what this will look like.
63

63

00:04:03.778  -->  00:04:07.923
So, it's like the image always stays in the same place
64

64

00:04:07.923  -->  00:04:10.077
and we scroll our website
65

65

00:04:10.077  -->  00:04:12.779
and the image stays always in the same place.
66

66

00:04:12.779  -->  00:04:14.485
So, I think this is a cool effect
67

67

00:04:14.485  -->  00:04:16.802
and it's really easy to achieve
68

68

00:04:16.802  -->  00:04:20.885
and in fact, we should do the same thing up here.
69

69

00:04:22.427  -->  00:04:23.953
Okay?
70

70

00:04:23.953  -->  00:04:27.286
So, I will just copy this to the header,
71

71

00:04:28.301  -->  00:04:29.134
CSS block,
72

72

00:04:31.389  -->  00:04:34.972
just to see if it looks cool there as well.
73

73

00:04:35.961  -->  00:04:36.794
Okay?
74

74

00:04:38.826  -->  00:04:40.451
And this is the effect.
75

75

00:04:40.451  -->  00:04:44.576
So, the image stays in the same place and we just scroll
76

76

00:04:44.576  -->  00:04:47.521
and I think this is really cool
77

77

00:04:47.521  -->  00:04:51.524
and down here, it will look even cooler
78

78

00:04:51.524  -->  00:04:54.607
once we add more sections below this.
79

79

00:04:55.649  -->  00:04:58.595
So, the next step would be to define
80

80

00:04:58.595  -->  00:05:01.845
these block quotes elements right here.
81

81

00:05:04.731  -->  00:05:09.261
So, this is very straight forward, of course.
82

82

00:05:09.261  -->  00:05:11.511
Just write our block quote,
83

83

00:05:14.666  -->  00:05:15.499
select it.
84

84

00:05:18.465  -->  00:05:21.675
And the first thing is we maybe want some penning there
85

85

00:05:21.675  -->  00:05:23.585
because you saw that the boxes
86

86

00:05:23.585  -->  00:05:26.409
were very close to each other
87

87

00:05:26.409  -->  00:05:28.659
and I will say, two percent
88

88

00:05:30.269  -->  00:05:32.436
and then it is quite usual
89

89

00:05:33.277  -->  00:05:36.405
to show the customer testimonials
90

90

00:05:36.405  -->  00:05:37.988
in an italic style.
91

91

00:05:40.042  -->  00:05:44.209
So, in order to do that, I will say font, style, italic.
92

92

00:05:47.824  -->  00:05:51.991
And I can do this only because I already incorporated
93

93

00:05:53.492  -->  00:05:56.992
the italic style for my Google fonts here.
94

94

00:05:58.612  -->  00:06:02.362
So whenever you need italics on your website,
95

95

00:06:03.265  -->  00:06:06.313
you need to include that web font.
96

96

00:06:06.313  -->  00:06:09.787
Now, another thing, is I want some line height here
97

97

00:06:09.787  -->  00:06:13.954
as always, and I will again choose 145 percent here.
98

98

00:06:19.019  -->  00:06:21.165
Okay, much better right?
99

99

00:06:21.165  -->  00:06:25.188
And now, we can form it the side element
100

100

00:06:25.188  -->  00:06:29.355
and the images that are inside of the side element as well.
101

101

00:06:32.502  -->  00:06:34.919
So, this is, again very easy.
102

102

00:06:36.769  -->  00:06:40.751
We can do this because we will only use the side
103

103

00:06:40.751  -->  00:06:43.677
and block quote elements in this place.
104

104

00:06:43.677  -->  00:06:47.293
So, we don't need to make any class for those.
105

105

00:06:47.293  -->  00:06:49.772
So, in here, I would say that the font size
106

106

00:06:49.772  -->  00:06:53.855
could be a little smaller, like 90 percent maybe.
107

107

00:06:56.253  -->  00:07:00.703
And, let's add some margins to the top as well.
108

108

00:07:00.703  -->  00:07:01.536
Margin top
109

109

00:07:02.694  -->  00:07:04.527
of let's say 25 pixels
110

110

00:07:07.143  -->  00:07:09.256
and now for the image,
111

111

00:07:09.256  -->  00:07:12.629
so it's the image inside of the side
112

112

00:07:12.629  -->  00:07:16.083
and by now, you're already really familiar with all of that.
113

113

00:07:16.083  -->  00:07:20.250
So, the image, I will say, will have a height of 50 pixels
114

114

00:07:22.117  -->  00:07:25.700
and a border, a border radius of 50 percent
115

115

00:07:28.720  -->  00:07:31.321
and you already know as well,
116

116

00:07:31.321  -->  00:07:34.154
that this makes any element round.
117

117

00:07:35.710  -->  00:07:39.550
And we want some margins to the right side as well.
118

118

00:07:39.550  -->  00:07:41.883
Let me say, here, 10 pixels.
119

119

00:07:43.633  -->  00:07:45.624
So, we made some changes here.
120

120

00:07:45.624  -->  00:07:47.791
So, let me check it again.
121

121

00:07:49.302  -->  00:07:51.635
Okay, so what is going here?
122

122

00:07:53.609  -->  00:07:55.776
We need a line break here.
123

123

00:07:57.023  -->  00:08:00.151
So it's the text and then the text just continues
124

124

00:08:00.151  -->  00:08:03.484
with the image then the rest of the text.
125

125

00:08:03.484  -->  00:08:06.389
Now, the best way to actually do this,
126

126

00:08:06.389  -->  00:08:09.472
is to define this as a block element.
127

127

00:08:11.712  -->  00:08:15.227
So, what we can do, is to say, that the side element
128

128

00:08:15.227  -->  00:08:17.310
should be a block element
129

129

00:08:19.067  -->  00:08:23.234
and so, once more we use the display property with block.
130

130

00:08:25.203  -->  00:08:27.453
And this should do the job.
131

131

00:08:29.551  -->  00:08:30.892
Exactly.
132

132

00:08:30.892  -->  00:08:32.985
So, this is what I hoped for.
133

133

00:08:32.985  -->  00:08:37.152
Now, it's a block element and so it is aligned for itself.
134

134

00:08:38.206  -->  00:08:42.107
Now, I want this text here to be aligned with this
135

135

00:08:42.107  -->  00:08:44.524
and this is again, very easy.
136

136

00:08:46.272  -->  00:08:50.439
We just say that we some vertical align through the middle.
137

137

00:08:53.647  -->  00:08:56.390
And now it should look just as we wanted.
138

138

00:08:56.390  -->  00:08:59.093
I think the images are a little too big.
139

139

00:08:59.093  -->  00:09:01.429
Don't you think so?
140

140

00:09:01.429  -->  00:09:05.188
They take up too much space, I guess.
141

141

00:09:05.188  -->  00:09:07.362
Now, what's also missing here,
142

142

00:09:07.362  -->  00:09:11.195
is a big quotation mark, which we can put here
143

143

00:09:12.543  -->  00:09:15.204
and I will show you a great way to do this
144

144

00:09:15.204  -->  00:09:19.999
and we will once again use the after zero class,
145

145

00:09:19.999  -->  00:09:21.848
no, in fact, we will use the before
146

146

00:09:21.848  -->  00:09:26.015
because this time we want it to appear before our text.
147

147

00:09:28.431  -->  00:09:30.514
So, let's quickly do this
148

148

00:09:31.539  -->  00:09:34.242
and first of all, let me change this,
149

149

00:09:34.242  -->  00:09:38.325
said it was too big, so maybe 45 will work better
150

150

00:09:39.646  -->  00:09:43.852
and now, let's find the before zero class.
151

151

00:09:43.852  -->  00:09:45.102
So side, before
152

152

00:09:47.102  -->  00:09:50.739
and we want it to be a quotation mark.
153

153

00:09:50.739  -->  00:09:54.906
So, remember how do we put text on a website using just CSS.
154

154

00:09:55.889  -->  00:09:57.472
It is with content.
155

155

00:09:59.070  -->  00:10:02.991
The last time we used this we didn't want to see any words
156

156

00:10:02.991  -->  00:10:05.658
so we just leave an empty space.
157

157

00:10:07.379  -->  00:10:10.915
I will just to exemplify this, put an A,
158

158

00:10:10.915  -->  00:10:15.730
and we will then put a quotation mark in a second.
159

159

00:10:15.730  -->  00:10:19.468
For now, let me just show you how this looks
160

160

00:10:19.468  -->  00:10:22.841
and we'll also ignore that we can see it
161

161

00:10:22.841  -->  00:10:26.591
and change the font size here to 400 percent.
162

162

00:10:30.846  -->  00:10:33.228
Alright, this is not what I wanted
163

163

00:10:33.228  -->  00:10:37.395
because I actually wanted it before the block quote right?
164

164

00:10:39.161  -->  00:10:40.994
So, it is block quote.
165

165

00:10:54.379  -->  00:10:55.629
And here we go.
166

166

00:10:57.121  -->  00:11:01.368
Alright, now, in order to put the quotation mark there
167

167

00:11:01.368  -->  00:11:04.344
is not as easy as it may sound
168

168

00:11:04.344  -->  00:11:07.844
because in order to do that we need to use
169

169

00:11:10.343  -->  00:11:13.843
something called an ISO special character.
170

170

00:11:16.398  -->  00:11:20.096
So, this here is a list that I'll include into the course
171

171

00:11:20.096  -->  00:11:24.263
E-book and in here we can just choose some sign if you want
172

172

00:11:27.553  -->  00:11:31.470
and then will have to copy this very code here.
173

173

00:11:32.510  -->  00:11:34.774
So, in order to make it easier for me
174

174

00:11:34.774  -->  00:11:37.857
I will just search for quotation mark
175

175

00:11:40.849  -->  00:11:43.849
and this is not the one that I want.
176

176

00:11:45.806  -->  00:11:47.889
It's this one right here.
177

177

00:11:49.036  -->  00:11:50.154
I want this.
178

178

00:11:50.154  -->  00:11:52.154
So, I need to copy this.
179

179

00:11:55.416  -->  00:11:57.166
This code right here.
180

180

00:11:58.707  -->  00:11:59.540
Alright.
181

181

00:12:00.800  -->  00:12:02.800
Now, I'll paste it here.
182

182

00:12:05.412  -->  00:12:07.424
So, let's check this.
183

183

00:12:07.424  -->  00:12:09.476
Alright, here we go.
184

184

00:12:09.476  -->  00:12:11.264
Cool, right?
185

185

00:12:11.264  -->  00:12:14.697
Now, we need to have to set a new line once again.
186

186

00:12:14.697  -->  00:12:18.364
So, we have to make this as a block element.
187

187

00:12:19.899  -->  00:12:21.399
So, let's do that.
188

188

00:12:23.048  -->  00:12:25.381
Just plain block, very easy.
189

189

00:12:27.497  -->  00:12:32.455
Now, in order to position this exactly where we want it
190

190

00:12:32.455  -->  00:12:36.205
we need to define its top and left attributes
191

191

00:12:40.135  -->  00:12:43.772
because it is really the easiest way
192

192

00:12:43.772  -->  00:12:48.384
is to change this around using absolute positioning.
193

193

00:12:48.384  -->  00:12:52.051
So, position absolute and then we can change
194

194

00:12:55.190  -->  00:12:57.440
its top, maybe, five pixels
195

195

00:13:02.363  -->  00:13:03.780
and left to zero.
196

196

00:13:06.472  -->  00:13:07.305
Alright?
197

197

00:13:08.241  -->  00:13:10.700
And, before we can see how this looks
198

198

00:13:10.700  -->  00:13:14.032
there's a very important thing that we have to do
199

199

00:13:14.032  -->  00:13:15.901
and it's this.
200

200

00:13:15.901  -->  00:13:19.734
When we make an element with absolute position
201

201

00:13:20.960  -->  00:13:24.028
we have to ensure that its parent
202

202

00:13:24.028  -->  00:13:26.028
has a relative position,
203

203

00:13:29.067  -->  00:13:31.342
so in this case, we will have to say,
204

204

00:13:31.342  -->  00:13:35.467
that this here is relative and if we didn't do this
205

205

00:13:35.467  -->  00:13:38.634
this wouldn't appear where we want it.
206

206

00:13:40.932  -->  00:13:42.182
And here we go.
207

207

00:13:43.431  -->  00:13:47.312
Okay, this is way too close to the text.
208

208

00:13:47.312  -->  00:13:50.786
So, let us put back to zero maybe,
209

209

00:13:50.786  -->  00:13:54.953
but we can put the left to minus three for instance.
210

210

00:13:58.157  -->  00:13:59.240
You see this?
211

211

00:14:00.290  -->  00:14:02.058
Yeah, this looks cool.
212

212

00:14:02.058  -->  00:14:05.390
Maybe what I should do is to give it some space
213

213

00:14:05.390  -->  00:14:09.223
between this line here and those block quotes.
214

214

00:14:10.632  -->  00:14:14.817
So, in order to have more space for this one here,
215

215

00:14:14.817  -->  00:14:16.199
this quotation mark, and I should
216

216

00:14:16.199  -->  00:14:19.366
probably also do this a little bigger.
217

217

00:14:22.802  -->  00:14:26.642
So, I'll increase this to 500 percent actually
218

218

00:14:26.642  -->  00:14:30.888
and then, I will say that we want some margin
219

219

00:14:30.888  -->  00:14:33.555
to the top of this of 40 pixels.
220

220

00:14:35.622  -->  00:14:39.789
And this can actually be also, let's say, minus five pixels.
221

221

00:14:43.383  -->  00:14:47.609
And here, minus five pixels as well wouldn't hurt.
222

222

00:14:47.609  -->  00:14:51.023
And, this is what it looks like now.
223

223

00:14:51.023  -->  00:14:55.030
So, now we have one more section designed
224

224

00:14:55.030  -->  00:14:58.804
and I really like what we achieved here in this section.
225

225

00:14:58.804  -->  00:15:01.608
This background image is really cool
226

226

00:15:01.608  -->  00:15:04.249
and also this effect that we added to this section
227

227

00:15:04.249  -->  00:15:07.703
and to this one, it's really cool.
228

228

00:15:07.703  -->  00:15:12.396
We're starting to get a really good looking website.
229

229

00:15:12.396  -->  00:15:16.419
So, next up, we have the section with some pricing plans.
230

230

00:15:16.419  -->  00:15:19.914
Remember, we'll use some new stuff.
231

231

00:15:19.914  -->  00:15:22.664
So, don't wait and see you there.
