<v Voiceover>In this lecture, we're going to start</v>
2

2

00:00:04.135  -->  00:00:07.459
to write CSS for text formatting, so you can see
3

3

00:00:07.459  -->  00:00:09.250
how CSS works.
4

4

00:00:09.250  -->  00:00:11.167
It's really easy.
5

5

00:00:12.472  -->  00:00:16.171
So, we'll jump right into the CSS file here,
6

6

00:00:16.171  -->  00:00:18.254
to start write some code.
7

7

00:00:20.056  -->  00:00:22.564
CSS is written in rules.
8

8

00:00:22.564  -->  00:00:26.731
Each rule consists of a selector, and a declaration block.
9

9

00:00:27.901  -->  00:00:32.068
To exemplify that, we'll start formatting the main heading.
10

10

00:00:33.004  -->  00:00:36.535
So, H1 is the selector
11

11

00:00:36.535  -->  00:00:39.762
because it will select all H1 elements.
12

12

00:00:39.762  -->  00:00:43.416
This means that all H1 elements will be formatted
13

13

00:00:43.416  -->  00:00:47.349
with the code we will write in the declaration block,
14

14

00:00:47.349  -->  00:00:49.266
here in curly brackets.
15

15

00:00:52.401  -->  00:00:55.484
So, I will start with the text color.
16

16

00:00:57.079  -->  00:00:59.749
We will choose green in this example.
17

17

00:00:59.749  -->  00:01:00.749
So, color...
18

18

00:01:03.259  -->  00:01:05.759
And I just write, green
19

19

00:01:06.671  -->  00:01:09.004
and then semicolon.
20

20

00:01:10.137  -->  00:01:12.900
And you see the H1 element actually changed
21

21

00:01:12.900  -->  00:01:14.483
its color to green.
22

22

00:01:15.844  -->  00:01:17.605
So, to sum this up,
23

23

00:01:17.605  -->  00:01:20.263
the property here is color,
24

24

00:01:20.263  -->  00:01:24.430
and the value of the property here is the name, green.
25

25

00:01:26.352  -->  00:01:30.102
Next, we want to change the text size, right?
26

26

00:01:31.216  -->  00:01:35.515
So just write font size
27

27

00:01:35.515  -->  00:01:40.432
and brackets gives us some suggestions as we write.
28

28

00:01:40.432  -->  00:01:43.515
And now I will choose just 40 pixels.
29

29

00:01:45.766  -->  00:01:47.594
You see, it changed?
30

30

00:01:47.594  -->  00:01:48.927
Maybe 50 pixels.
31

31

00:01:51.335  -->  00:01:53.418
No, 40 pixels was better.
32

32

00:01:54.516  -->  00:01:57.558
You see we are already designing in the browser,
33

33

00:01:57.558  -->  00:02:01.115
we're changing the values of the attributes,
34

34

00:02:01.115  -->  00:02:03.198
and see which looks best.
35

35

00:02:05.889  -->  00:02:09.165
Now suppose we wanted to change the font family.
36

36

00:02:09.165  -->  00:02:11.498
Let's say, to Helvetica New.
37

37

00:02:13.050  -->  00:02:14.217
Let's do that.
38

38

00:02:15.067  -->  00:02:17.984
It's font family, right?
39

39

00:02:19.043  -->  00:02:22.626
And now just type, Helvetica New.
40

40

00:02:26.859  -->  00:02:31.026
And again, the H1 element changed its family.
41

41

00:02:32.428  -->  00:02:35.613
Now if that font is not available on your system,
42

42

00:02:35.613  -->  00:02:38.282
which is likely, if you're on windows.
43

43

00:02:38.282  -->  00:02:41.978
Let's tell the browser to use Arial instead.
44

44

00:02:41.978  -->  00:02:46.145
And to do so, we just write Arial after a comma here,
45

45

00:02:47.527  -->  00:02:51.694
and then the semicolon, as before.
46

46

00:02:53.521  -->  00:02:55.582
So Helvetica is the first choice,
47

47

00:02:55.582  -->  00:02:58.165
and Arial is the second choice.
48

48

00:02:59.186  -->  00:03:03.353
And now, let's go do the same thing for the H2 elements.
49

49

00:03:04.518  -->  00:03:08.685
We want them to look the same, but a smaller font size.
50

50

00:03:09.752  -->  00:03:12.669
So let's copy this H1 rule,
51

51

00:03:15.967  -->  00:03:19.800
and paste it down here, and change this to H2.
52

52

00:03:22.146  -->  00:03:25.004
Now these two look exactly the same.
53

53

00:03:25.004  -->  00:03:28.254
The H1 looks exactly the same as the H2
54

54

00:03:30.288  -->  00:03:31.871
elements down here.
55

55

00:03:32.767  -->  00:03:35.533
Because for now we didn't change anything.
56

56

00:03:35.533  -->  00:03:39.200
So let's change this here to, let's say, 25.
57

57

00:03:41.197  -->  00:03:44.114
And that's a much better font size.
58

58

00:03:46.765  -->  00:03:48.729
Now, we repeated some rules here.
59

59

00:03:48.729  -->  00:03:49.995
You see?
60

60

00:03:49.995  -->  00:03:54.011
The H1 and the H2 have the same color
61

61

00:03:54.011  -->  00:03:56.094
and the same font family.
62

62

00:03:56.960  -->  00:03:58.927
And we should actually avoid that,
63

63

00:03:58.927  -->  00:04:02.111
because repeating code is bad practice.
64

64

00:04:02.111  -->  00:04:04.169
Instead of repeating, we can just group
65

65

00:04:04.169  -->  00:04:06.336
the common rules together.
66

66

00:04:07.258  -->  00:04:10.352
This is something we will be doing a lot,
67

67

00:04:10.352  -->  00:04:13.158
so just showing it to you.
68

68

00:04:13.158  -->  00:04:16.473
So, write H1 and H2,
69

69

00:04:16.473  -->  00:04:18.640
and the declaration block.
70

70

00:04:19.662  -->  00:04:22.495
So everything that is common here,
71

71

00:04:23.853  -->  00:04:28.345
I will cut and paste it up here.
72

72

00:04:28.345  -->  00:04:32.512
And the font family is also the same for these two.
73

73

00:04:36.067  -->  00:04:38.734
So, did you see what I did here?
74

74

00:04:40.417  -->  00:04:43.571
Now I can delete this from here,
75

75

00:04:43.571  -->  00:04:45.537
because it's already declared here
76

76

00:04:45.537  -->  00:04:47.704
in the common declaration.
77

77

00:04:48.859  -->  00:04:51.764
Now let's quickly format the paragraphs.
78

78

00:04:51.764  -->  00:04:55.361
I will first go back to the HTML file
79

79

00:04:55.361  -->  00:04:59.335
and delete this random text we put here,
80

80

00:04:59.335  -->  00:05:03.502
just to see how strong, and emphasize and underline works.
81

81

00:05:06.962  -->  00:05:10.895
As you can imagine, we'll use the P selector here.
82

82

00:05:10.895  -->  00:05:14.361
And I'll show you another bracket secret here.
83

83

00:05:14.361  -->  00:05:17.022
Instead of switching to the CSS file,
84

84

00:05:17.022  -->  00:05:20.772
you can edit CSS right here in the HTML file.
85

85

00:05:22.036  -->  00:05:24.796
Just click on the P tag,
86

86

00:05:24.796  -->  00:05:28.013
and then hit Command+E, or Control+E.
87

87

00:05:28.013  -->  00:05:29.467
Command+E.
88

88

00:05:29.467  -->  00:05:32.740
And this opens a CSS editing section
89

89

00:05:32.740  -->  00:05:35.361
right here in this file.
90

90

00:05:35.361  -->  00:05:37.887
This is called Quick Edit.
91

91

00:05:37.887  -->  00:05:40.212
Now hit new rule.
92

92

00:05:40.212  -->  00:05:43.397
Now it automatically puts the P selector
93

93

00:05:43.397  -->  00:05:46.564
and the declaration block here for us.
94

94

00:05:48.500  -->  00:05:50.750
OK, I want the font size...
95

95

00:05:52.525  -->  00:05:55.108
To, let's say, 18 pixels.
96

96

00:05:57.569  -->  00:05:58.402
Great.
97

97

00:06:00.279  -->  00:06:04.189
And let's justify this text.
98

98

00:06:04.189  -->  00:06:08.402
And for that, we use a text align property
99

99

00:06:08.402  -->  00:06:10.235
and set it to justify.
100

100

00:06:12.845  -->  00:06:14.389
Very well.
101

101

00:06:14.389  -->  00:06:18.556
We could also use right, center or left,
102

102

00:06:19.814  -->  00:06:21.925
but we want to justify here.
103

103

00:06:21.925  -->  00:06:25.195
I will also adjust the font family.
104

104

00:06:25.195  -->  00:06:27.696
Do you remember how to do that?
105

105

00:06:27.696  -->  00:06:31.285
It is font family
106

106

00:06:31.285  -->  00:06:34.618
and it was Helvetica New
107

107

00:06:38.716  -->  00:06:41.133
or as a second choice, Arial.
108

108

00:06:44.659  -->  00:06:45.492
All right.
109

109

00:06:47.136  -->  00:06:49.569
Maybe you noticed that the link text is still
110

110

00:06:49.569  -->  00:06:52.524
in original format down here.
111

111

00:06:52.524  -->  00:06:56.364
Now we could go ahead and format the A tag, right?
112

112

00:06:56.364  -->  00:07:00.171
That will show you a much better solution.
113

113

00:07:00.171  -->  00:07:03.254
So let's switch back to the CSS file.
114

114

00:07:05.411  -->  00:07:09.578
And at the beginning, I will add a rule for the body.
115

115

00:07:10.607  -->  00:07:13.929
And since everything is inside the body,
116

116

00:07:13.929  -->  00:07:18.283
this rule will apply to everything visible on the web page.
117

117

00:07:18.283  -->  00:07:22.768
So this means all elements that have no defined styles.
118

118

00:07:22.768  -->  00:07:25.900
So this is like a global rule.
119

119

00:07:25.900  -->  00:07:29.150
So, body, and that's it.
120

120

00:07:30.891  -->  00:07:35.058
So first thing, I could go ahead and copy the font family
121

121

00:07:36.833  -->  00:07:38.500
right into the body.
122

122

00:07:42.402  -->  00:07:43.576
Like this.
123

123

00:07:43.576  -->  00:07:45.865
OK, now you see that everything
124

124

00:07:45.865  -->  00:07:49.647
has the Helvetica New font family.
125

125

00:07:49.647  -->  00:07:53.480
Even the links, which I didn't even style yet.
126

126

00:07:54.425  -->  00:07:58.592
If I delete this font family declaration down here
127

127

00:07:59.546  -->  00:08:01.046
for the P element,
128

128

00:08:03.324  -->  00:08:07.955
it still looks the same because we defined that everything
129

129

00:08:07.955  -->  00:08:12.122
inside the body will have Helvetica New as font family.
130

130

00:08:13.295  -->  00:08:17.295
And I will do the same thing with the font size.
131

131

00:08:18.159  -->  00:08:20.401
We'll cut it here,
132

132

00:08:20.401  -->  00:08:22.568
paste it here in the body.
133

133

00:08:24.518  -->  00:08:27.609
So the paragraph is back to the 18 pixels,
134

134

00:08:27.609  -->  00:08:31.442
but now the links are also at 18 pixels.
135

135

00:08:33.505  -->  00:08:37.442
Now the reason this works, is because of CSS inheritance,
136

136

00:08:37.442  -->  00:08:41.510
which is a very important concept in CSS.
137

137

00:08:41.510  -->  00:08:44.036
We changed the font size in the body,
138

138

00:08:44.036  -->  00:08:47.364
and so the elements that are inside of the body
139

139

00:08:47.364  -->  00:08:49.281
inherit its style.
140

140

00:08:50.152  -->  00:08:53.059
So child elements inherit the properties
141

141

00:08:53.059  -->  00:08:55.817
from their parent elements.
142

142

00:08:55.817  -->  00:08:57.925
Unless we overwrite their styles,
143

143

00:08:57.925  -->  00:09:02.092
as we did right here in the H1 and H2.
144

144

00:09:04.489  -->  00:09:08.072
Sorry, in the H2 declarations.
145

145

00:09:09.343  -->  00:09:13.740
All right, I think this was a good introduction to CSS code.
146

146

00:09:13.740  -->  00:09:15.407
So, congratulations.
147

147

00:09:16.414  -->  00:09:19.454
You have created some nice, clean CSS code here
148

148

00:09:19.454  -->  00:09:22.687
without repetitions and have made the text
149

149

00:09:22.687  -->  00:09:25.119
look pretty good for now.
150

150

00:09:25.119  -->  00:09:26.536
Isn't that great?
151

151

00:09:27.500  -->  00:09:29.660
Now this was a lot of stuff to absorb,
152

152

00:09:29.660  -->  00:09:32.232
so feel free to go through it again
153

153

00:09:32.232  -->  00:09:35.790
and make sure you understand exactly what we did.
154

154

00:09:35.790  -->  00:09:37.608
Because it's very important
155

155

00:09:37.608  -->  00:09:40.651
that you understand everything from here
156

156

00:09:40.651  -->  00:09:43.978
because from now we will use these concepts
157
