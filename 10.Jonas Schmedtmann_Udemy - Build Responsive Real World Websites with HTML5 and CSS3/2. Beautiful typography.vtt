<v Voiceover>Welcome back.</v>
2

2

00:00:02.945  -->  00:00:07.112
This is our very important lecture about typography.
3

3

00:00:08.043  -->  00:00:12.526
According to Wikipedia, typography is the art and technique
4

4

00:00:12.526  -->  00:00:14.854
of arranging type to make written language
5

5

00:00:14.854  -->  00:00:17.270
readable and beautiful.
6

6

00:00:17.270  -->  00:00:20.157
This means that typography is an essential part
7

7

00:00:20.157  -->  00:00:21.819
of any design.
8

8

00:00:21.819  -->  00:00:24.606
And that's because most of your website
9

9

00:00:24.606  -->  00:00:26.440
will be text content.
10

10

00:00:26.440  -->  00:00:29.365
And so it's quite important to make that content
11

11

00:00:29.365  -->  00:00:32.988
good-looking and easy to read for the user
12

12

00:00:32.988  -->  00:00:35.519
Good typography can make every design
13

13

00:00:35.519  -->  00:00:37.899
look very professional.
14

14

00:00:37.899  -->  00:00:39.966
So let's look at a couple of guidelines
15

15

00:00:39.966  -->  00:00:42.323
to achieve exactly that.
16

16

00:00:42.323  -->  00:00:44.482
I will start with some simple rules.
17

17

00:00:44.482  -->  00:00:48.649
And after that, I will go over choosing some good fonts,
18

18

00:00:49.880  -->  00:00:53.178
how to get them and how to choose the right font for
19

19

00:00:53.178  -->  00:00:54.261
your website.
20

20

00:00:56.962  -->  00:00:59.018
For the first couple of guidelines,
21

21

00:00:59.018  -->  00:01:03.603
I will use this website to show you good and bad things.
22

22

00:01:03.603  -->  00:01:08.186
So first, use a font size between 15 and 25 pixels
23

23

00:01:08.186  -->  00:01:09.935
for body text.
24

24

00:01:09.935  -->  00:01:12.315
It really depends on the typeface you choose,
25

25

00:01:12.315  -->  00:01:16.355
how much text you got and how much you want that text
26

26

00:01:16.355  -->  00:01:17.438
to stand out.
27

27

00:01:18.375  -->  00:01:22.520
Here in this example, we have a font size of 22 pixels,
28

28

00:01:22.520  -->  00:01:24.603
and it looks really good.
29

29

00:01:26.097  -->  00:01:27.512
And this is what it looks like
30

30

00:01:27.512  -->  00:01:30.589
without using these guidelines.
31

31

00:01:30.589  -->  00:01:34.199
The first example has only 14 pixels font size,
32

32

00:01:34.199  -->  00:01:36.998
and it's clearly way too small, right?
33

33

00:01:36.998  -->  00:01:39.738
And down here in the second paragraph,
34

34

00:01:39.738  -->  00:01:43.035
the text looks unnaturally big and exaggerated
35

35

00:01:43.035  -->  00:01:45.775
with those 30 pixels font size.
36

36

00:01:45.775  -->  00:01:48.525
So wipe both of these situations.
37

37

00:01:50.918  -->  00:01:54.459
Now for headlines and titles, you can and should, of course,
38

38

00:01:54.459  -->  00:01:58.372
use bigger font sizes to show that it's important text
39

39

00:01:58.372  -->  00:02:01.634
that you really want the user to read.
40

40

00:02:01.634  -->  00:02:05.675
There are no real size limits for headlines, like this one.
41

41

00:02:05.675  -->  00:02:08.159
So here we have the headline of the website
42

42

00:02:08.159  -->  00:02:09.854
we've been seeing before.
43

43

00:02:09.854  -->  00:02:12.896
And it has a font size of 60 pixels,
44

44

00:02:12.896  -->  00:02:15.646
and I think looks great actually.
45

45

00:02:17.273  -->  00:02:20.058
This website here has an extremely big headline,
46

46

00:02:20.058  -->  00:02:22.141
with 90 pixels font size.
47

47

00:02:23.217  -->  00:02:25.957
And sometimes when you use such a big headline,
48

48

00:02:25.957  -->  00:02:29.835
you will want to decrease the font weight of that text.
49

49

00:02:29.835  -->  00:02:34.212
This ensures that the text doesn't steal too much attention
50

50

00:02:34.212  -->  00:02:36.209
from the rest of the content.
51

51

00:02:36.209  -->  00:02:39.112
And it makes the text look less bulky
52

52

00:02:39.112  -->  00:02:41.909
and more modern and elegant.
53

53

00:02:41.909  -->  00:02:46.611
And that is exactly what this website here is doing right.
54

54

00:02:46.611  -->  00:02:50.778
Next up, use a line spacing between 120 and 150%
55

55

00:02:52.034  -->  00:02:53.451
of the font size.
56

56

00:02:54.459  -->  00:02:57.838
Line spacing is the vertical distance between lines
57

57

00:02:57.838  -->  00:03:00.915
and makes text easier to read.
58

58

00:03:00.915  -->  00:03:03.399
Back to our example, this web page here
59

59

00:03:03.399  -->  00:03:07.566
uses a line spacing of 150% to make the text easy to read.
60

60

00:03:09.356  -->  00:03:12.523
This is an example of good typography.
61

61

00:03:13.361  -->  00:03:16.867
And this is what it looks like with bad typography.
62

62

00:03:16.867  -->  00:03:19.967
With 100% line spacing, which is what happens
63

63

00:03:19.967  -->  00:03:22.951
when you don't define any line spacing at all,
64

64

00:03:22.951  -->  00:03:26.631
you see this big block of text, which is not easy to read
65

65

00:03:26.631  -->  00:03:29.510
because the lines almost overlap.
66

66

00:03:29.510  -->  00:03:32.029
This is a really bad practice.
67

67

00:03:32.029  -->  00:03:36.591
Now at 200%, it's also not pleasant to read the text
68

68

00:03:36.591  -->  00:03:38.566
because it's way too spaced out,
69

69

00:03:38.566  -->  00:03:40.412
and our eyes have a difficult time
70

70

00:03:40.412  -->  00:03:43.651
processing the text like this.
71

71

00:03:43.651  -->  00:03:47.651
So leave line spacing between 120 and 150%,
72

72

00:03:48.736  -->  00:03:50.548
and you will be fine.
73

73

00:03:50.548  -->  00:03:55.191
45 to 90 characters per line is the optimal line length
74

74

00:03:55.191  -->  00:03:57.293
that is easy to read.
75

75

00:03:57.293  -->  00:03:59.406
45 to 90 characters is like
76

76

00:03:59.406  -->  00:04:02.831
two to three lowercase alphabets,
77

77

00:04:02.831  -->  00:04:04.653
just as a reference for you.
78

78

00:04:04.653  -->  00:04:08.845
So here, for example, our first line has 78 characters.
79

79

00:04:08.845  -->  00:04:12.014
So its easy to follow the text.
80

80

00:04:12.014  -->  00:04:14.487
And here again, some bad examples.
81

81

00:04:14.487  -->  00:04:17.912
In the first example, we have just 36 characters.
82

82

00:04:17.912  -->  00:04:19.933
And it looks kind of weird.
83

83

00:04:19.933  -->  00:04:21.976
You can, of course, do this
84

84

00:04:21.976  -->  00:04:24.611
if you have some columns with some text.
85

85

00:04:24.611  -->  00:04:28.953
But not in a situation like this with a lot of text.
86

86

00:04:28.953  -->  00:04:32.088
And down here, the text line is way too long.
87

87

00:04:32.088  -->  00:04:34.072
And our eyes find it difficult to travel
88

88

00:04:34.072  -->  00:04:37.290
such a long distance from the end of one line
89

89

00:04:37.290  -->  00:04:40.296
to the beginning of the next line.
90

90

00:04:40.296  -->  00:04:43.768
And finally, the most important thing is probably
91

91

00:04:43.768  -->  00:04:46.414
to choose good-looking fonts.
92

92

00:04:46.414  -->  00:04:51.268
Now, there are no real rules for selecting the right font.
93

93

00:04:51.268  -->  00:04:54.089
But since this is a very practical guide,
94

94

00:04:54.089  -->  00:04:57.050
I will just tell you to use good fonts.
95

95

00:04:57.050  -->  00:04:59.766
I will show you a couple of good fonts that will look good
96

96

00:04:59.766  -->  00:05:01.647
in every design.
97

97

00:05:01.647  -->  00:05:04.747
You can use one of those or of course,
98

98

00:05:04.747  -->  00:05:08.694
go for some other font that you like better.
99

99

00:05:08.694  -->  00:05:10.471
But let's first distinguish between
100

100

00:05:10.471  -->  00:05:12.971
serif and sans-serif typeface.
101

101

00:05:14.232  -->  00:05:17.355
On the left side, sans-serif typefaces
102

102

00:05:17.355  -->  00:05:19.713
are more neutral, looking more clean
103

103

00:05:19.713  -->  00:05:21.233
and more simple.
104

104

00:05:21.233  -->  00:05:25.773
They are widely used in most modern websites or apps.
105

105

00:05:25.773  -->  00:05:29.116
On the other side, a serif typeface is one that has
106

106

00:05:29.116  -->  00:05:33.295
those small extensions or strokes, called serifs
107

107

00:05:33.295  -->  00:05:34.747
at the end of the letters,
108

108

00:05:34.747  -->  00:05:38.915
just as you can see here on the right side.
109

109

00:05:38.915  -->  00:05:40.502
Serif typefaces are usually used
110

110

00:05:40.502  -->  00:05:43.822
for more traditional purposes that encourage
111

111

00:05:43.822  -->  00:05:46.405
long reading and story telling.
112

112

00:05:47.451  -->  00:05:50.077
And this is how sans-serif text looks like
113

113

00:05:50.077  -->  00:05:52.388
on an actual website.
114

114

00:05:52.388  -->  00:05:55.534
You're probably used to see sans-serif text everywhere
115

115

00:05:55.534  -->  00:05:59.634
because it's more used than serif font styles.
116

116

00:05:59.634  -->  00:06:02.178
Also look how the heading uses bigger text,
117

117

00:06:02.178  -->  00:06:04.358
but with a very low font weight
118

118

00:06:04.358  -->  00:06:06.551
as I explained to you before.
119

119

00:06:06.551  -->  00:06:08.827
This website is absolutely beautiful
120

120

00:06:08.827  -->  00:06:13.065
and uses all the typography rules that I showed you before.
121

121

00:06:13.065  -->  00:06:16.323
And here are a couple of very good sans-serif fonts
122

122

00:06:16.323  -->  00:06:18.490
available on Google fonts.
123

123

00:06:19.597  -->  00:06:22.697
Now Google fonts is a very good free resource,
124

124

00:06:22.697  -->  00:06:25.122
where you can get web fonts.
125

125

00:06:25.122  -->  00:06:28.258
And web fonts are fonts that you can include directly
126

126

00:06:28.258  -->  00:06:33.001
into your projects without having to download any files.
127

127

00:06:33.001  -->  00:06:36.296
All of these fonts you see here are broadly used.
128

128

00:06:36.296  -->  00:06:39.558
You can't get wrong when choosing any of them.
129

129

00:06:39.558  -->  00:06:42.438
And Lato is actually the font that I used
130

130

00:06:42.438  -->  00:06:45.479
for this presentation in this course.
131

131

00:06:45.479  -->  00:06:48.243
Please take a look at the Google fonts website.
132

132

00:06:48.243  -->  00:06:51.377
You can find it in the course e-book.
133

133

00:06:51.377  -->  00:06:53.044
And now, serif font.
134

134

00:06:54.083  -->  00:06:57.322
Here is again the website we've been looking at before
135

135

00:06:57.322  -->  00:07:00.201
because it's a great example of really beautiful use
136

136

00:07:00.201  -->  00:07:03.835
of a serif font, at least in the body part.
137

137

00:07:03.835  -->  00:07:07.876
For the headings, this website actually uses a serif font.
138

138

00:07:07.876  -->  00:07:09.477
So you see that you can actually mix
139

139

00:07:09.477  -->  00:07:12.937
serif and sans-serif fonts in one website
140

140

00:07:12.937  -->  00:07:15.758
and make it look gorgeous.
141

141

00:07:15.758  -->  00:07:18.440
Here are three beautiful serif typefaces,
142

142

00:07:18.440  -->  00:07:20.634
also from Google fonts.
143

143

00:07:20.634  -->  00:07:22.458
I encourage you to use these
144

144

00:07:22.458  -->  00:07:24.721
if you have a lot of text to show,
145

145

00:07:24.721  -->  00:07:28.982
like a blog website that should have more traditional look.
146

146

00:07:28.982  -->  00:07:32.882
So how should you actually choose a typeface?
147

147

00:07:32.882  -->  00:07:35.843
The most important thing is that the font you choose
148

148

00:07:35.843  -->  00:07:40.000
depends strongly on the website you're designing.
149

149

00:07:40.000  -->  00:07:43.077
You need to choose a font, which best helps to reflect
150

150

00:07:43.077  -->  00:07:46.083
the look and feel you want for your website
151

151

00:07:46.083  -->  00:07:47.919
that you're designing.
152

152

00:07:47.919  -->  00:07:51.644
Because ultimately, the goal of choosing the right typeface
153

153

00:07:51.644  -->  00:07:54.199
is to engage your audience.
154

154

00:07:54.199  -->  00:07:57.439
Based on that, you can decide if you're better off
155

155

00:07:57.439  -->  00:08:01.304
with a sans-serif or with a serif typeface.
156

156

00:08:01.304  -->  00:08:04.776
And after you decided that, use a good font.
157

157

00:08:04.776  -->  00:08:08.723
You can start with one after ones that I showed you before.
158

158

00:08:08.723  -->  00:08:10.778
And if you're a complete beginner,
159

159

00:08:10.778  -->  00:08:13.600
then please only use one typeface.
160

160

00:08:13.600  -->  00:08:15.735
If you want to use more than one,
161

161

00:08:15.735  -->  00:08:18.463
please take a look at the course e-book.
162

162

00:08:18.463  -->  00:08:22.585
You will find a tool there which helps repairing fonts,
163

163

00:08:22.585  -->  00:08:26.777
which means to choose two good fonts for a website.
164

164

00:08:26.777  -->  00:08:28.285
The best you can do is to play around
165

165

00:08:28.285  -->  00:08:31.641
with different typefaces and see which best helps
166

166

00:08:31.641  -->  00:08:34.997
to achieve what you want for your website.
167

167

00:08:34.997  -->  00:08:37.004
And that's it for typography.
168

168

00:08:37.004  -->  00:08:39.838
This was quite a long lecture actually.
169

169

00:08:39.838  -->  00:08:43.158
And next up, we have another very important aspect
170

170

00:08:43.158  -->  00:08:44.505
of web design,
171

171

00:08:44.505  -->  00:08:45.724
colors.
172

172

00:08:45.724  -->  00:08:48.807
So join me right in the next lecture.
