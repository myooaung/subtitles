1
00:00:00,540 --> 00:00:04,890
Excellent work on your mission agent Let's quickly have a deep briefing on how you're able to complete

2
00:00:04,890 --> 00:00:10,420
your tasks.

3
00:00:10,430 --> 00:00:18,260
The first thing you had to do was to send e-mail and we can do this with import S and T P lib and then

4
00:00:18,260 --> 00:00:27,830
create in the actual object centipede live asem T.P. and then connecting to the correct domain server

5
00:00:27,830 --> 00:00:31,610
for your email address for this case its Gmail.

6
00:00:31,940 --> 00:00:34,600
And then we can pass in our port 587 as well.

7
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:42,500
And we also want to make sure that we immediately afterwards do our hello to connect and greet the server

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:49,930
and then we also want to start tell us so I'm Topy object start.

9
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:57,500
Tell us so running that we get the connection ready to go and let's grab our email and password.

10
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:01,120
We can do that with get pass or really any what you prefer.

11
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,680
E-mail us is equal to get pass don't get pass

12
00:01:10,410 --> 00:01:22,630
e-mail and then we also have your password for your e-mail address get pass get pass.

13
00:01:22,860 --> 00:01:30,390
And then once we have that we will log in with that information log in with the e-mail and that password

14
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:33,800
so we can provide that e-mail address.

15
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:40,960
And then we can provide whatever your password is and the case of Gmail it's going to be that app password

16
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:41,700
you created.

17
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,120
So once you provide your e-mail and your app password for your Gmail account you should see something

18
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:55,820
that was accepted and then we need to provide a from address to address and then the subject so from

19
00:01:55,820 --> 00:02:03,370
address will be the same as our current e-mail the to address

20
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:16,070
is going to be info at the gold bugs dot com and then our subject can really be whatever we want we'll

21
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:23,880
say test and then message can again be whatever we want we're just looking for an auto reply.

22
00:02:24,190 --> 00:02:32,580
So I will say please reply and then the actual message we sent is going to be subject.

23
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:41,560
Colon Plus the subject line plus a new line and then plus the rest of that message.

24
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:52,980
After that we'll say awesome object and we'll run send the mail from the address to the address and

25
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:53,730
we'll provide it.

26
00:02:53,730 --> 00:03:01,130
The SMG message so run that we should be able to send an e-mail to and fought the good books that come.

27
00:03:01,250 --> 00:03:06,680
And if you've got this empty dictionary that means it was successful once you've done that we can quit

28
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:14,920
our session and now it's time to check for a reply to that that we will import.

29
00:03:15,230 --> 00:03:16,260
I IMAP live.

30
00:03:18,770 --> 00:03:27,510
We'll create a connection with IMAP live to our actual server will say I'm out for SSL and then for

31
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:32,710
Gmail it's going to be app that gmail dot com.

32
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:37,410
And we actually already know our e-mail and password from up here.

33
00:03:37,630 --> 00:03:45,460
So we'll be using the same ones who will say log in email password.

34
00:03:45,520 --> 00:03:46,180
Run that.

35
00:03:46,330 --> 00:03:51,600
And we should hopefully be able to see OK once you've done that we can select our inbox

36
00:03:55,790 --> 00:03:57,800
and that should also say OK.

37
00:03:57,980 --> 00:04:03,420
And then we can say type data and we will search our inbox.

38
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:07,640
I'll start off with none and then we need some sort of special code here.

39
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:16,800
Now we'll look for from info at the gold bugs dot com and see if they reply to anything.

40
00:04:17,060 --> 00:04:19,370
So we'll run that check the type.

41
00:04:19,540 --> 00:04:20,160
OK.

42
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:22,840
And then let's check the data and see if we have anything.

43
00:04:22,850 --> 00:04:26,480
So in this case I've actually already e-mailed for the gold bugs multiple times.

44
00:04:26,480 --> 00:04:28,640
You can see here I have multiple results.

45
00:04:28,640 --> 00:04:32,000
In your case you should probably only see one single result.

46
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:43,200
Let's grab the actual e-mail data itself by fetching one of these IDs will say results e-mail data physical

47
00:04:43,270 --> 00:04:48,650
to fetch and I will fetch that last one.

48
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:52,860
So it will say 2 8 4 9 4

49
00:04:57,950 --> 00:05:08,180
RAFC 8 2 2 as my protocol that I'm going to grab that raw e-mail data using the same sort of indexing

50
00:05:08,180 --> 00:05:10,700
we previously saw.

51
00:05:10,760 --> 00:05:22,130
E-mail is equal to email data use some indexing there create the raw email stream equal to raw e-mail

52
00:05:22,460 --> 00:05:30,860
and Im going to decode this to be UTF 8 and then I'm going to use the email library that's built into

53
00:05:30,860 --> 00:05:36,050
Python to actually try to get nicer printing of this string.

54
00:05:36,050 --> 00:05:37,080
So let's try that out.

55
00:05:37,170 --> 00:05:47,090
I say that the e-mail message is equal to e-mail message from string and we'll say raw email string

56
00:05:48,900 --> 00:05:56,190
and then we will do the walkthrough and see if we can print out the body for parts in that e-mail message

57
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:00,200
we just created the walk method.

58
00:06:00,900 --> 00:06:04,020
If parts get content type

59
00:06:06,810 --> 00:06:08,070
is equal to.

60
00:06:08,070 --> 00:06:12,250
And in this case the Roque's have been linking to other Web sites.

61
00:06:12,270 --> 00:06:18,750
So instead of just saying text forward slash plane we will say text forward slash Tim L.

62
00:06:22,370 --> 00:06:27,420
And then the body is going to be equal to parts payload.

63
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:31,640
We'll say de-code is equal to true.

64
00:06:31,790 --> 00:06:39,710
And then let's print the body of this message and if it looks like this then we successfully got the

65
00:06:39,710 --> 00:06:41,810
body of the message itself.

66
00:06:41,810 --> 00:06:48,080
But in this case it looks like it's still in some sort of T.M. where we can do to try to fix this is

67
00:06:48,170 --> 00:06:57,520
grab this information copy it turn one of these cells into a markdown cell and then paste it in here

68
00:06:58,350 --> 00:07:03,550
and we should now be able to read it as formatted says if you're reading this message you are able to

69
00:07:03,550 --> 00:07:05,060
find the email from the PDA.

70
00:07:05,140 --> 00:07:09,160
Using the CSP file and it looks like there's two links here for the next phase.

71
00:07:09,190 --> 00:07:12,460
We'll click on those two links and see what they have.

72
00:07:12,520 --> 00:07:14,860
It looks to be two images.

73
00:07:14,860 --> 00:07:19,590
Looks like it's just some scrambled addresses with random words in here.

74
00:07:19,690 --> 00:07:23,830
And the other one seems to be a cover image so that indicates we now need to learn how to work with

75
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,710
images with Python.

76
00:07:26,200 --> 00:07:27,520
Excellent work agents.

77
00:07:27,710 --> 00:07:29,050
We'll see you at the next mission.
