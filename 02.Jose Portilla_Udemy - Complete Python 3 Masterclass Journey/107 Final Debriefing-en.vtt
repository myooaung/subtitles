Below agent My name is Grace Hopper.



2

00:00:10.890 --> 00:00:14.660

I'm the daughter of the director and leader of the so-called rogues.



3

00:00:14.850 --> 00:00:19.800

Thanks to your tireless efforts those of us in the resistance have finally been able to come out from



4

00:00:19.800 --> 00:00:21.120

the shadows.



5

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:27.270

My own mission began back when during a field mission I uncovered incriminating information that led



6

00:00:27.270 --> 00:00:31.950

me to believe my own mother may have been corrupted by the power of the Institute.



7

00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:38.310

Over time I discovered she was using the institute's resources to further her own interests selling



8

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:44.600

Institute secrets to the highest bidder regardless of their morals or who could be harmed.



9

00:00:44.940 --> 00:00:47.030

I knew that I could not let this continue.



10

00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:52.450

But I also knew that my mother was now aware of my discoveries and it wasn't safe for me to return.



11

00:00:52.530 --> 00:00:53.900

So I went into hiding.



12

00:00:54.180 --> 00:01:00.020

While in hiding I enlisted the help of a group of trusted agents to undermine her efforts.



13

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:04.710

Now thanks to you we've been able to achieve our greatest goal revealing the truth.



14

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:09.840

With any luck we should soon be able to restore the institute to its former greatness.



15

00:01:09.840 --> 00:01:14.160

There is one last thing in all the chaos of the rainbow missions.



16

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:18.270

It appears the director has evaded capture and is now on the run.



17

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:23.430

I have spoken with agents Anita and Alan and they speak very highly of your abilities.



18

00:01:23.460 --> 00:01:25.660

If anyone can be trusted to track her down.



19

00:01:25.680 --> 00:01:26.530

It's you.



20

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:27.900

So what do you say.



21

00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:30.360

Are you ready for your next mission.
