Welcome to your next mission agent the image links from the previous mission led to a document with



2

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:09.520

some information and an encrypted message.



3

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:16.650

The key for that encrypted message was the largest known Fermat prime pass through the H-3 256 bit hash



4

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.990

and it was noted that that number should be passed as a byte string by placing a B in from the string



5

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:23.990

of that number.



6

00:00:24.030 --> 00:00:28.710

This was the encrypted message can you figure out how to decrypt this message for us.



7

00:00:28.710 --> 00:00:29.280

Best of luck.



8

00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:29.730
