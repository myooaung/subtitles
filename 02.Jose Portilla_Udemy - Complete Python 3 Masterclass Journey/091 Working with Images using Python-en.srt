1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:03,800
Welcome back agent the results of the green mission.

2
00:00:03,800 --> 00:00:06,220
E-mail returns back to images.

3
00:00:06,230 --> 00:00:11,960
Let's learn how we can work with images in Python in order for you to succeed in your next mission.

4
00:00:13,310 --> 00:00:14,850
To work with images in Python.

5
00:00:14,870 --> 00:00:19,490
You're going to need to install the pillow library to do this at your command line.

6
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:27,080
Go ahead and type Pipp install and then if a capital P pillow if you're working with the Jupiter notebook's

7
00:00:27,090 --> 00:00:33,760
system with many large images displaying You may reach the default display data rate limit that is once

8
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,220
you show an image after showing many other large images.

9
00:00:37,390 --> 00:00:39,190
You make an error that looks like the following.

10
00:00:39,190 --> 00:00:42,400
That says something like I O pub data rate exceeded.

11
00:00:42,400 --> 00:00:48,400
If this ever happens to you and your notebook system to fix this issue all you have to do is relaunch

12
00:00:48,400 --> 00:00:49,920
the Jupiter note book your command line.

13
00:00:49,930 --> 00:00:51,430
With this additional flag.

14
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:57,550
So instead of just typing Jupiter notebook you can type Jupiter notebook space dash dash and then that

15
00:00:57,550 --> 00:00:58,900
line of code right there.

16
00:00:58,900 --> 00:01:05,830
Basically it just raises your input output limit so that notebook says it's OK to display more data

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,110
as images.

18
00:01:07,180 --> 00:01:11,820
If you're just using up postscripts then you won't have to worry about this.

19
00:01:11,870 --> 00:01:19,190
Let's not begin exploring how to work with images with Python.

20
00:01:19,270 --> 00:01:27,850
Once you've installed the pillow library you'll be able to type out from L import image and this will

21
00:01:27,850 --> 00:01:31,200
then allow you to call the open function off of this image.

22
00:01:31,970 --> 00:01:36,630
Scrip you can say image the open and then inside the blue mission folder.

23
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:43,990
We have an example that JPEG file for you and if you check out this it looks like this picture of a

24
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:45,760
Macintosh computer.

25
00:01:45,760 --> 00:01:49,590
Now keep in mind that this sort of display only works for that Jupiter notebook.

26
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,960
As far as just showing the actual variable and then seeing the direct output if you are running a script

27
00:01:56,050 --> 00:02:03,220
off of this we need to do is type out the show open close princes and then that will display the actual

28
00:02:03,220 --> 00:02:05,700
image for you when running your pie script.

29
00:02:05,770 --> 00:02:08,850
But we don't need to worry about that in the notebook.

30
00:02:08,920 --> 00:02:09,810
Continuing on.

31
00:02:09,850 --> 00:02:12,240
Let's go ahead and grab some image information.

32
00:02:12,490 --> 00:02:19,180
If I wanted to know the width and height of the actual image I can say Mac thoughts and then grab the

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:26,620
heights or excuse me grab the size attribute and that returns a tuple where this first is with and the

34
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:28,330
second one is height.

35
00:02:28,360 --> 00:02:35,500
So this is w by h in pixels and can also tell you information such as the file name and then it can

36
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,360
also even give you the format description.

37
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:43,430
So in case you needed more details about the actual JPEG format you can see it's jpeg.

38
00:02:43,510 --> 00:02:48,900
ISO 1 0 9 1 8 which is just some standard format for JPG files.

39
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,920
That is what the images.

40
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:57,730
We can also crop images of Python and the way we can do that is by calling the crop method off of our

41
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:04,720
variable storing the actual image we can say a Mac crop and then you'll notice that it expects a box

42
00:03:04,750 --> 00:03:11,290
which is a 4 item tuple defining the left upper right and lower pixel coordinates.

43
00:03:11,290 --> 00:03:17,050
This is a little confusing at first so let's quickly jump to an example of what those coordinates actually

44
00:03:17,050 --> 00:03:18,600
represent.

45
00:03:18,610 --> 00:03:25,630
Let's imagine that we just had a single blue rectangle as our image than what we can do at the top left

46
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,510
corner of this image as 0 0.

47
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:37,020
And then we can make the x axis go along horizontally and on the vertical axis we can call that y.

48
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:43,570
So basically now the first two coordinates in that tuple of four are going to be your starting X and

49
00:03:43,570 --> 00:03:50,410
you're starting Y where 0 0 is measured from the top left corner of the image the next to R W and H

50
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:51,670
for width and height.

51
00:03:51,670 --> 00:03:53,240
And those are also coordinates.

52
00:03:53,500 --> 00:03:59,620
So you would pick the additional two coordinates of width and height and essentially from these four

53
00:03:59,710 --> 00:04:07,580
items the starting X and Y and then the width and height coordinates of the actual pixels themselves.

54
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,730
Then you can end up creating a rectangle and crop out that image.

55
00:04:12,730 --> 00:04:15,950
So let's see this in practice now by jumping back to the notebook.

56
00:04:16,210 --> 00:04:21,640
So off of this we will say zero comma zero.

57
00:04:21,650 --> 00:04:28,040
So I'll start at the very top corner and then we can say 100 100 for these starting coordinates of that

58
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:30,600
width and height to be 100 100.

59
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:34,900
So when we run that we basically get the top left corner of that Mac picture.

60
00:04:34,910 --> 00:04:35,930
If we scroll back up.

61
00:04:36,110 --> 00:04:39,340
That's essentially this corner appear in the top left.

62
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:42,860
So the Mac image isn't really a useful demonstration of cropping.

63
00:04:43,070 --> 00:04:53,160
So we have another image for you called pencils so we will say it equals to image open and we will open

64
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:54,670
pencils that jpeg.

65
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,780
And if we take a look at what pencil's is it's a very large image of some colored pencils on the left

66
00:05:00,780 --> 00:05:01,490
hand side.

67
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:03,160
Everything else is gray.

68
00:05:03,570 --> 00:05:08,640
Let's attempt to grab some of the top pencils from the corner in order to do this we need to know the

69
00:05:08,640 --> 00:05:12,190
size of the image we'll say pencils size.

70
00:05:12,340 --> 00:05:16,320
We see it's 1950 pixels by 3500 pixels.

71
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:22,650
So what we're going to do is if we just wanted for instance these top few colored pencils maybe only

72
00:05:22,650 --> 00:05:29,330
up to this orange colored pencils so the top three were going to start off at the top corner to say

73
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:32,350
X is zero and Y is zero.

74
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:39,900
And then the with from there let's go ahead and grab about 10 percent in the y direction.

75
00:05:39,900 --> 00:05:49,990
So we'll say that with or actually this is about a third say 30 percent in the extraction and 10 percent

76
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:51,910
in the y direction.

77
00:05:52,030 --> 00:05:58,930
So that means the with is going to be 1950 divided by three.

78
00:05:58,940 --> 00:06:07,100
So we're essentially grabbing 30 percent of the width here and we'll grab about 10 percent of this height

79
00:06:07,490 --> 00:06:17,940
say H is equal to 13:00 divided by 10 then we will say pencils crop and they will pass in our tuple

80
00:06:18,060 --> 00:06:22,240
x y w h.

81
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:26,750
And here you can see we're able to successfully grab those three.

82
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:29,700
Now let's imagine we want to grab pencils from the bottom.

83
00:06:29,870 --> 00:06:32,550
So we wanted to just grab these three pencils right here.

84
00:06:32,630 --> 00:06:34,080
Or maybe these four.

85
00:06:34,490 --> 00:06:41,090
In that case we'll say X starts at zero but now y is going to start all the way.

86
00:06:41,090 --> 00:06:44,870
So X starting at zero y is going start all the way down here.

87
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:50,400
Maybe just a little bit off of the heights to the heights 3300.

88
00:06:50,630 --> 00:06:58,950
So let's go ahead and say that now if we just want the bottom for bottom pencils we'll start exercising

89
00:06:59,020 --> 00:07:03,180
so why is going to be equal to 11 100.

90
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,980
So we're starting x zero y all the way down here at eleven hundred and then we're going to go all the

91
00:07:09,980 --> 00:07:12,150
way to the bottom for this height.

92
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:15,780
So now I will say the height just goes to 3500.

93
00:07:16,070 --> 00:07:17,540
And then the width is going to be the same.

94
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:19,200
1950 divided by three.

95
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:22,900
So we want about 30 percent of that with coming off of that.

96
00:07:22,920 --> 00:07:24,380
So we do this again.

97
00:07:24,840 --> 00:07:29,420
And then if we do the same crop now we get those bottom colored pencils.

98
00:07:29,430 --> 00:07:31,970
So again keep in mind that these are coordinates.

99
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:37,980
It's not exactly a measurement of width and height which is why h is equal to 3300 here instead of some

100
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:38,960
smaller number.

101
00:07:38,970 --> 00:07:41,400
So it's essentially a start finish.

102
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:44,880
And then we kind of start finishes well.

103
00:07:44,930 --> 00:07:49,150
So let's go back to the Mac photo and see if we can just grab the computer itself.

104
00:07:49,160 --> 00:07:58,030
So if I say Mac I have the computer here let's see it's size so max size is 1993 by 12:57.

105
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:05,380
So about the halfway point we want to grab halfway here and then a little bit off of it so we can find

106
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:15,170
half way as equal to 1993 divided by two and then we'll say that our x position that we're going to

107
00:08:15,170 --> 00:08:21,210
start off at is half way minus 200 pixels.

108
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:29,200
And with that we're going to end that is half way plus 200 pixels and then we'll say something like

109
00:08:29,200 --> 00:08:32,990
Why is a hundred and you can kind of just guess and check for these numbers.

110
00:08:33,010 --> 00:08:37,730
These are essentially just lucky guesses H because that's always the end.

111
00:08:38,590 --> 00:08:39,340
And let's try this.

112
00:08:39,330 --> 00:08:45,550
We'll see it Mac thought Krop x y w h.

113
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:51,380
And then here we can see that we were able to successfully grab the computer image analysis Cisco's

114
00:08:51,400 --> 00:08:57,790
copying and pasting images if we want to create a copy what we can do is reassign that crop.

115
00:08:57,790 --> 00:09:09,490
We can say computer is equal to map Krop x y w h and that can call the paste method off of this and

116
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,230
then I provide the actual image.

117
00:09:11,260 --> 00:09:12,660
This case it's computer.

118
00:09:12,850 --> 00:09:19,000
And then the where the top left corner is going to go and that's going to be a tuple of just two coordinates.

119
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:23,890
So we'll go ahead and put it in the top left corner of the original Mac and then check out the Mac looks

120
00:09:23,890 --> 00:09:24,090
like.

121
00:09:24,090 --> 00:09:29,830
Now we were able to copy and paste this to the top left corner and you can do this multiple times if

122
00:09:29,830 --> 00:09:32,110
you want one further in.

123
00:09:32,110 --> 00:09:37,280
You can find this further and so it can say 7 9 6 or something like that.

124
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,820
Read this again and now paste it another piece of that Mac.

125
00:09:40,840 --> 00:09:45,730
So keep in mind this is personally affecting the variable but it's not permanently affecting the actual

126
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:46,870
image itself.

127
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:48,860
This is all just happening in memory.

128
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:55,090
You can also use the resize method to resize an image so to show you what I mean by that.

129
00:09:55,170 --> 00:10:03,600
If we say Mac size we have 1983 by 12:57 if we wanted to make it much smaller or stretch and squeeze

130
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:09,500
it we can say MacT resize and you can just use whatever sizes you want here.

131
00:10:09,570 --> 00:10:14,200
For instance if I want to stretch it out or squeeze it I can say Make it three thousand pixels by five

132
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,450
hundred pixels and it will WIPs let's make sure we pass this as a tuple.

133
00:10:20,460 --> 00:10:21,000
There we go.

134
00:10:21,030 --> 00:10:26,020
And it will stretch and squeeze to whatever sizes you want so you can make it twice as big half as big.

135
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,030
That's really up to you.

136
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,480
You just set the new size you want.

137
00:10:29,550 --> 00:10:37,470
You can also rotate images and that's just done with the rotate method so we can say Mack rotate and

138
00:10:37,470 --> 00:10:43,320
you can rotate by 90 degrees and then you can see here that we're able to rotate our image by 9 degrees

139
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:46,440
to finish off our discussion of work and images.

140
00:10:46,620 --> 00:10:49,080
Let's go ahead and take a look at transparency.

141
00:10:50,230 --> 00:10:58,060
Here we can see that a lot of images have a red green blue a R.G. be a system and that stands for red

142
00:10:58,060 --> 00:11:05,860
green blue Alpha and all the values of red green blue and Alpha can go from zero to 255 if the alpha

143
00:11:05,860 --> 00:11:07,500
value is zero.

144
00:11:07,660 --> 00:11:09,730
Then the image is completely transparent.

145
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,510
If it's 255 then the image is completely opaque.

146
00:11:14,510 --> 00:11:20,200
Let's explore this idea of transparency by opening up to images that we have for you.

147
00:11:21,220 --> 00:11:25,130
So these are in your blue mission folders you can say image the open.

148
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,910
We have a red color.

149
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,780
JPA.

150
00:11:27,970 --> 00:11:30,050
So if you take a look at it it's just a red square.

151
00:11:30,280 --> 00:11:37,250
And we also have a blue jay pick for you which is going to be able to image open and we will open up

152
00:11:37,430 --> 00:11:42,500
that blue color PMG And now we can see we have blue there.

153
00:11:42,550 --> 00:11:50,500
So if you want to reset the alpha one of these you can say put alpha and then pasand some integer value

154
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:52,620
from 0 to 255.

155
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:57,010
So if he Passons 0 it means it's completely transparent.

156
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:02,450
So now I only see white because the background is white.

157
00:12:02,450 --> 00:12:09,120
If I reset the Alpha to be 255 completely opaque and I run this again then I actually see the blue.

158
00:12:09,260 --> 00:12:11,740
If I choose somewhere between has to be an integer.

159
00:12:11,750 --> 00:12:17,250
So for example 128 then I get back the sort of lighter blue.

160
00:12:17,330 --> 00:12:20,360
Here we can see that some White has them extend to this blue.

161
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:21,880
And to give an idea of what that looks like.

162
00:12:21,900 --> 00:12:27,500
Fred let's say red Alpha to about 128.

163
00:12:27,590 --> 00:12:29,260
And check out what red looks like now.

164
00:12:29,420 --> 00:12:32,220
Now it looks even a little more pink.

165
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:39,230
OK so what if we actually put these two images on top of each other and they have some sort of alpha.

166
00:12:39,230 --> 00:12:43,190
That means we should be able to see something that looks a little bit purple ish.

167
00:12:43,370 --> 00:12:50,510
So I will say blue and I'm going to paste in the image that I'm going to paste is going to be red so

168
00:12:50,510 --> 00:12:55,770
that red image that we just edit the Alpha will set the box to 00.

169
00:12:55,850 --> 00:13:02,210
And if you want actual transparency to occur and not just straight up have a peek block over at the

170
00:13:02,210 --> 00:13:05,510
blue block you actually want to take into effect a transparency.

171
00:13:05,540 --> 00:13:09,470
You need to say mask is equal to and you pasand the same image you provided.

172
00:13:09,470 --> 00:13:10,930
So in this case it was red.

173
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,570
She sent Maskey to read.

174
00:13:13,820 --> 00:13:20,540
And when you run that WIPs let's make sure that we find the actual box and how we check out what blue

175
00:13:20,540 --> 00:13:21,350
looks like.

176
00:13:21,620 --> 00:13:23,620
We get back purple.

177
00:13:23,720 --> 00:13:25,040
So what are we actually doing here.

178
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:31,490
We're pasting in the red image at top left corner and then also saying that we want the red image to

179
00:13:31,550 --> 00:13:36,820
work as a mask indicating that we actually want transparency to be taken into effect.

180
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:42,800
Otherwise if you didn't have that mask you would essentially just see the red block completely because

181
00:13:42,830 --> 00:13:46,970
it's almost like taking two sheets of colored paper and then putting them on top of each other instead

182
00:13:46,970 --> 00:13:51,800
of with transparency or a mask you can think of almost like shining a light through those pieces of

183
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,160
paper to see the transparency effect.

184
00:13:55,160 --> 00:13:55,910
All right.

185
00:13:55,910 --> 00:13:59,820
That's the basics of working with images and I hope that helps you in your next mission.
