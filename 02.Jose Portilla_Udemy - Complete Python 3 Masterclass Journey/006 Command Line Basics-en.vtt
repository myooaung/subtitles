00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:04.950

Welcome to the institute recruit before we install anything.



2

00:00:05.020 --> 00:00:08.720

Let's have a quick crash course of how to use your command line.



3

00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.570

We're going to be using the command line later on to run Python scripts.



4

00:00:14.050 --> 00:00:19.150

The things we cover are just the basics how to find your current directory at the command line how to



5

00:00:19.150 --> 00:00:25.450

list all the files and folders in a directory how to change directories and then how to clear the command



6

00:00:25.450 --> 00:00:26.420

line screen.



7

00:00:26.710 --> 00:00:32.920

These are just the basic things we need to know before we actually install Python now because of slight



8

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:35.330

differences of command line syntax.



9

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:36.600

There's going to be differences.



10

00:00:36.640 --> 00:00:41.490

If you're on Mac OS or Linux or if you're on a Windows computer because of this.



11

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:47.770

Go ahead and jump to the time stamps shown here in order to actually follow the commands for your particular



12

00:00:47.800 --> 00:00:49.270

operating system.



13

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:50.450

OK.



14

00:00:50.470 --> 00:00:54.420

Windows users can essentially keep watching we're going to jump directly to Windows.



15

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:58.600

And if you're on Mac OS jump to the time stamp shown here.



16

00:00:58.600 --> 00:01:00.200

Welcome back recruit.



17

00:01:00.250 --> 00:01:04.090

So you're on a Windows operating system and you need to learn how to use the command line.



18

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:07.660

The first thing we need to do is actually open up our command prompt.



19

00:01:07.660 --> 00:01:11.230

Let's see if we can find it at your computer to find the command prompt.



20

00:01:11.230 --> 00:01:14.090

All you need to do is search for the term see M.D.



21

00:01:14.170 --> 00:01:17.070

And you should be able to find command prompt as the best match.



22

00:01:17.290 --> 00:01:19.800

If command prompt doesn't show up when you search CMD.



23

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:25.150

Instead just search for the whole phrase command prompt and then you should see command prompt.



24

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:25.990

Desktop.



25

00:01:26.170 --> 00:01:30.700

Once you've opened up your command prompt you should see something that looks like this.



26

00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:34.510

Let's start off by finding out where are we currently located.



27

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:37.030

Basically what's our current directory.



28

00:01:37.030 --> 00:01:42.400

I can use the command line to interact on my computer but to actually perform those interactions I need



29

00:01:42.400 --> 00:01:45.040

to know where I'm at on my computer.



30

00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:49.960

You can think of this as basically programmatically moving around through files and folders on your



31

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:51.270

computer.



32

00:01:51.610 --> 00:01:57.500

You can type out CD the hit enter and this will report back your current directory.



33

00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:02.640

Now you'll notice the command prompt actually basically gives you the file path over you already are.



34

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.420

But sometimes it's the file path is really long or you're dealing with more complex things like virtual



35

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.370

environments or installations.



36

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:13.820

It's always a good idea to check your current directory by typing CD.



37

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:18.750

Sometimes things like the Anaconda prompt will have other directories in parentheses.



38

00:02:18.910 --> 00:02:25.170

You can always confirm your current directory by typing a CD enter and that reports back where you are.



39

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.680

So I can see right now I'm under this particular user's folder.



40

00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:37.360

If I wanted to figure out where all the files and folders located in my current directory were or are



41

00:02:37.420 --> 00:02:39.760

I can type d i r.



42

00:02:39.790 --> 00:02:40.590

Hit enter.



43

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:44.050

And that reports back the contents of my directory.



44

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:46.120

I can see here that there is a desktop.



45

00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:51.140

Documents downloads as well as some hidden files denoted by starting a fit.



46

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:58.540

But basically this is everything that's in this folder see users Marysia I can scroll down CCSB files



47

00:02:58.540 --> 00:02:59.680

pictures.



48

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:04.600

Now lets imagine I wanted to actually move into one of these sub folders.



49

00:03:04.630 --> 00:03:09.620

What I can do is type CD and then the name of that folder.



50

00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:16.750

For example if I wanted to change directories to my desktop location I can type CD change directory



51

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:24.310

space and the desktop to enter and now that my desktop and I can type CD to confirm that I'm at my desktop



52

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:27.220

if I want to go back up it their.



53

00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:35.560

All I need to do is type see the space dot dot or period period to enter and I've moved back up a directory.



54

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.970

Now you don't actually need to type in the entire file path.



55

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:47.040

If you're moving around what you can do is say CD begin typing such as the letter D that hit tab and



56

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.460

you should be able to see autocomplete for you.



57

00:03:49.510 --> 00:03:54.550

So as I hit tab I get the various options of everything that starts with a capital D so I can go to



58

00:03:54.550 --> 00:04:01.090

documents enter and then if I wanted to see all my documents I can type D R and we can see all our documents



59

00:04:01.090 --> 00:04:01.810

here.



60

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:08.140

Again if I want to go back see the space thought and if ever I want to clear my entire command line



61

00:04:08.140 --> 00:04:13.190

screen I can type CLX and I've cleared the entire screen.



62

00:04:13.270 --> 00:04:13.690

All right.



63

00:04:13.690 --> 00:04:16.330

That's really all the basics we need to know for right now.



64

00:04:16.330 --> 00:04:24.880

Just to review CD for current directory Diyar to list everything in my directory CD and then the name



65

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:27.170

of the folder that I want to jump to.



66

00:04:27.190 --> 00:04:32.980

For example if I want to go to downloads CD downloads again you can hit tab to autocomplete And if we



67

00:04:32.980 --> 00:04:35.690

ever want to jump back up CD.



68

00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:39.580

But if we ever want to clear the screen it's seamless.



69

00:04:39.730 --> 00:04:41.740

That's the basics you need to know.



70

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:42.740

Great job recruit.



71

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:47.710

We'll see you at the next lesson where we discuss how to install Python.



72

00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:49.280

Welcome back recruit.



73

00:04:49.280 --> 00:04:52.830

Now it's time to discuss Mac OS and Linux command line.



74

00:04:53.090 --> 00:04:58.550

If you only have a windows computer and you just watch the windows command line tutorial you can feel



75

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:02.540

free to skip the installation of Python lesson.



76

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:10.340

Now let's go ahead and show you how you can use the command line or terminal at Mac OS and Linux systems.



77

00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:16.540

The first step is to actually open it up to begin working of the command line on a Linux or Mac OS.



78

00:05:16.550 --> 00:05:22.660

You first need to open up your terminal search your computer for terminal your Mac OS or Linux.



79

00:05:22.670 --> 00:05:25.970

It's called the same thing and then open up your terminal.



80

00:05:25.970 --> 00:05:29.030

You should eventually get something that looks like this.



81

00:05:29.030 --> 00:05:34.060

The colors or fonts may be slightly different but the basic idea is the same.



82

00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:39.950

The terminal gives you a command line interface and the command line interface allows you to move around



83

00:05:40.010 --> 00:05:44.570

different files or folders on your computer and with some more advanced functionality you can also make



84

00:05:44.570 --> 00:05:46.730

new directories or remove directories.



85

00:05:46.730 --> 00:05:48.460

We don't really need to know that right now.



86

00:05:48.530 --> 00:05:54.680

All we really need to know is how to understand what our current working directory is changed directories



87

00:05:54.770 --> 00:05:56.270

and just move around.



88

00:05:56.270 --> 00:06:00.160

This basically allows us to move around the computer at the command line.



89

00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:07.460

The first thing we want to know is where we're currently located to know that type PWT enter and this



90

00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:09.440

will print your working directory.



91

00:06:09.470 --> 00:06:15.650

This is where you're currently located at the command line if you want to understand what files and



92

00:06:15.650 --> 00:06:23.330

folders are located at your current location type L S and then enter a should see a list of different



93

00:06:23.330 --> 00:06:27.520

files and folders at your current directory.



94

00:06:27.740 --> 00:06:35.900

If you ever want to move to one of those files or folders where you can do is type CD and then whichever



95

00:06:35.900 --> 00:06:41.150

file or folder you want to go to however it should be in the list that was just printed.



96

00:06:41.180 --> 00:06:50.650

For example let's move to our desktop so I will come back down here and type see the desktop enter.



97

00:06:50.710 --> 00:06:56.480

And now if I type PWT when I hit enter again I'm now at my desktop.



98

00:06:56.730 --> 00:07:00.670

If you ever want to clear your screen just type clear enter.



99

00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.320

And now you've been able to clear your command line.



100

00:07:04.270 --> 00:07:10.870

If you ever want to go back up a directory just see the space thought hit enter and now we're back up



101

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.320

a directory which I can confirm by typing PWT.



102

00:07:15.490 --> 00:07:16.760

That's really all we need to know.



103

00:07:16.810 --> 00:07:19.880

As far as the commands are concerned let's have a quick review.



104

00:07:20.740 --> 00:07:24.710

To print your working directory it's PWT and this report's back.



105

00:07:24.730 --> 00:07:26.290

We are currently located.



106

00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:29.550

If you want to know the files and folders at your current location.



107

00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:36.130

Type ls and this will list all the files and folders if you want to clear your command screen type clear



108

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:36.940

enter.



109

00:07:36.940 --> 00:07:44.110

This will clear your command line if you want to change directory to a subfolder type CD and then you



110

00:07:44.110 --> 00:07:47.140

can even begin typing the names such as desktop.



111

00:07:47.170 --> 00:07:51.300

And if I just desk and then hit tab it should auto complete.



112

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:56.800

If you do not get an auto complete by hitting tab that's probably a good indicator that it's not a direct



113

00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:03.430

subfolder of your current directory but then you can type CD the name of the subfolder or sub directory



114

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:07.200

and then we can see now we're located here by taping PWT.



115

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:14.350

If you ever want to go back up type CD space thought OK that's the basics of moving around through the



116

00:08:14.350 --> 00:08:15.280

command line.



117

00:08:15.310 --> 00:08:20.140

We're going to be using that later on when we run Python scripts at the command line.



118

00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:21.060

Great job recruit.



119

00:08:21.130 --> 00:08:26.170

We'll see you at the next lesson where we discuss how to actually install Python onto your computer.
