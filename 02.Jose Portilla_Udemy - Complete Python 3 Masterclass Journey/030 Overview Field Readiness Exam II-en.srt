Welcome to your second field reading this exam this field readiness exam will test your skills with

2
00:00:08,520 --> 00:00:13,500
control flow loops and built in functions such as the range function in Python.

3
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:16,400
Let's commence a quick overview of the exam.

4
00:00:16,410 --> 00:00:19,500
Here we are at the notebook for your second field readiness exam.

5
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:21,510
Let's quickly go over the tasks.

6
00:00:21,510 --> 00:00:26,310
Your first task is to use a for loop and indexing to print out only the words that start with an S in

7
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:28,500
the sentence and the sentence is right here.

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:31,170
Secret agents are super good at staying hidden.

9
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:34,920
Notice how this s is capitalized and other essays are not.

10
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,960
So given this string your code should be able to print something that looks like this secret super and

11
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:43,850
setting tasks Number two is to use the same string.

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:48,440
However now use a for loop that only prints out the words with an even number of characters.

13
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,540
So instead of this for loop you'll have to have some sort of check that the length of each word is even

14
00:00:53,590 --> 00:00:55,780
and if it is then go ahead and print it out.

15
00:00:56,880 --> 00:00:59,390
Test them or three is to use a list comprehension.

16
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:02,460
Create a list of every first letter in the string.

17
00:01:02,520 --> 00:01:05,880
So at the end of the day you should be able to create a list that looks something like this.

18
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:10,700
Notice how each of these characters is the first character in each of these words has.

19
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:12,520
Number four is to use list comprehensions.

20
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:15,640
Create a list of all the even numbers from 0 to 10.

21
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,610
The next task is to use the range function to create a list of all the even numbers from 0 to 10.

22
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:22,790
So notice the difference here.

23
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:24,870
The first one is using list comprehension.

24
00:01:24,870 --> 00:01:29,070
The second one you're going to need to be able to learn how to transform the range function or cast

25
00:01:29,070 --> 00:01:33,400
arrange function into creating the same sort of list.

26
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:38,400
Task number 6 is create a for loop that uses the random library to create a list of 10 random numbers.

27
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:40,320
So have to import it ran them for you here.

28
00:01:40,350 --> 00:01:45,080
Go ahead and use it to try to create a list that is just a bunch of random numbers.

29
00:01:45,120 --> 00:01:48,000
Obviously your results won't be the same as shown here.

30
00:01:49,070 --> 00:01:51,240
Use less comprehension and the random library.

31
00:01:51,330 --> 00:01:53,330
Create a list of 10 random numbers.

32
00:01:53,370 --> 00:01:57,050
So now it's a similar task except you have to use list comprehension.

33
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:03,650
Previously you had to use a for loop test number 8 is to create a while loop that will ask the user

34
00:02:03,740 --> 00:02:09,010
to input an even number and it's going to keep repeating the request until an even integer is provided.

35
00:02:09,260 --> 00:02:13,760
Now you should only expect integers to be passed then if the user provides a string or something else

36
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,670
that can't be transformed if an integer with the I.A. function then the loop is just going to break

37
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:20,520
with an air.

38
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,440
Again the important thing to keep in mind here when working via loops in the input function is that

39
00:02:25,460 --> 00:02:29,690
it's very easy to get stuck with an infinite loop as you're beginning to iterate on your code.

40
00:02:29,810 --> 00:02:34,430
If you ever get stuck then you going to see this in cell right here.

41
00:02:34,550 --> 00:02:37,220
Get stuck with an Asterix and it happens.

42
00:02:37,220 --> 00:02:39,880
Go ahead and click on kernel and then hit restart.

43
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:40,310
All right.

44
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:42,670
Best of luck recruit and we'll see you at the next lesson.

45
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:44,150
Well we'll go over the solutions.
