00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:05.180

Welcome back agent Let's discuss geographical plotting with Python.



2

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:11.480

There are many ways to plot geographical maps in Python and no single library will be able to create



3

00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.990

every possible geographical plot for the upcoming mission.



4

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:21.390

We need a method to plot longitude in latitudes for plotting out launch toon latitude coordinates.



5

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:23.920

A good choice is the Boka library.



6

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:27.680

This is a library designed to create interactive visualizations of Python.



7

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:32.340

It can also be used in conjunction with the Google Maps API to plot out points on a map.



8

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:37.940

You can zoom in and out of just like it could on a normal Google Maps Web site.



9

00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:43.330

Let's explore how to use Bocca and the Google Maps API to plot out longitude and latitude coordinates



10

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:46.150

onto a map in order to use boka.



11

00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.640

Make sure you install at your command line by running Pipp install Bocca at your command line.



12

00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:52.470

Let's get started.



13

00:00:55.980 --> 00:01:03.300

Let's begin by taking a look at the example CXXVI file will be using for our actual data inside of the



14

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.120

violent mission folder.



15

00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:09.720

You can import C S V and there's a countries that CSB file.



16

00:01:09.720 --> 00:01:17.610

So I will open it with open countries see the as f.



17

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:27.990

I will say file is equal to C-s the reader with and then for a row in that file that it just created.



18

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:34.680

I will print out the row and this will allow us to view that actual CFE file printed row by row and



19

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:39.490

it also close it because I am using the with command and it looks like we have a country a latitude



20

00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:41.810

longitude and then the name of the country.



21

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.080

What we're going to be doing is plenty out this latitude and longitude points in order to do that.



22

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:52.880

What we need is to grab all of these points as integers into a list.



23

00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:59.310

So we're going to comment all of this out and then create two lists latitudes



24

00:02:02.090 --> 00:02:07.660

and longs so lots and longs and where basically going to be running the same code.



25

00:02:07.670 --> 00:02:10.950

Let's grab this code again copy it down here.



26

00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:17.010

But instead of printing rows what we're going to be doing is the following will be using tuple and packing



27

00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.220

in this row.



28

00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:29.840

To say a B last long name because that is the exact same way that came out in the row you had the abbreviation



29

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:32.710

the latitude longitude and then the name of the country.



30

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:38.970

And in this case we'll say list a file in order to do that tuple unpacking.



31

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:45.120

Really it's less than packing and then we don't want the header file so we will say start at row 1 and



32

00:02:45.120 --> 00:02:46.110

go all the way to the end



33

00:02:49.710 --> 00:03:01.460

that inside of this loop will append the floats of the latitude of value and then we will append the



34

00:03:01.460 --> 00:03:04.660

float of the launch to the value.



35

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:14.050

Run that and you should be able to see your latitudes now as floats as well as your longitudes commet



36

00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:14.700

that out.



37

00:03:14.810 --> 00:03:16.890

And now it's time to use boka.



38

00:03:17.120 --> 00:03:19.210

The next step is to begin using Bocca.



39

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.510

Recall that Boka is an interactive plotting library for visualization with Python.



40

00:03:23.510 --> 00:03:28.850

And we'll be using the specific geographical plotting capabilities of this library to map out our list



41

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:33.970

of longitudes and latitudes in order to use Bocca for this sort of geographical plotting.



42

00:03:34.040 --> 00:03:40.520

You're also going to need to grab a developer key for Google Maps and it's free of any G-mail account



43

00:03:40.610 --> 00:03:46.600

and the link is available to you in a notebook that corresponds to this lesson.



44

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.850

And if you go to that link Let's go to it now.



45

00:03:49.010 --> 00:03:51.000

You will see something that looks like this.



46

00:03:51.020 --> 00:03:56.630

Keep in mind even though it says maps javascript API This is the same API key that we'll be using with



47

00:03:56.630 --> 00:03:59.920

Python and Bocca you'll click here on get key.



48

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.480

It will ask you to select or create a project.



49

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:04.010

You can't create a new project.



50

00:04:04.040 --> 00:04:09.290

Call it whatever you want or select an old one if you happen to have one there click next and eventually



51

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:11.290

it will generate a key for you.



52

00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.870

Once you have that key copy it because we'll be using it later on.



53

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.120

Let's come back here and begin our geographical plotting.



54

00:04:19.350 --> 00:04:24.420

We're going to be doing a lot of imports that we don't really need to actually dive deep into what they



55

00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:25.040

do.



56

00:04:25.110 --> 00:04:31.690

We just need to actually import them the first set of imports is going to be from Boca.



57

00:04:31.770 --> 00:04:40.460

So import output file and then show that's going to allow us to create an output file for our actual



58

00:04:40.460 --> 00:04:41.060

map.



59

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.190

And then also be able to show our map.



60

00:04:43.190 --> 00:04:49.840

And because the maps interactive it's going to open in a new tab in our browser then once you've done



61

00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.870

that we need to say from Boca that models import.



62

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:59.440

And this is we're going to import our actual mapping capabilities.



63

00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:05.260

The first one will be map plot and then also Geum map options.



64

00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:10.870

So the map plot allows actually plot a Google map g map options allows us to kind of edit around the



65

00:05:10.870 --> 00:05:17.020

options about where the map actually starts and then we need to import just a couple of more things.



66

00:05:17.050 --> 00:05:24.660

One is column data source another is circle because we want to draw little circles in the map and then



67

00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.120

some of these we may or may not use but they're combin imports will go ahead and do them anyways and



68

00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:35.340

as quick trick one imports over multiple lines you can just wrap them in parentheses.



69

00:05:35.490 --> 00:05:46.020

So we have the map plot GM map options column data source circle range one d the pan tool the wheel



70

00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:46.760

zoom tool



71

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:52.940

and then box select tool.



72

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:57.800

And those last couple of ones those are tools that will show up on the map that allow you to do things



73

00:05:57.800 --> 00:06:05.610

like draw a box on a map or zoom in and out of the map using the mouse wheel or run those imports.



74

00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:09.410

Now it's time to actually start choosing the starting latitude and longitude.



75

00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.860

Basically the center of the map we do that through the map options that we just imported.



76

00:06:16.370 --> 00:06:23.300

We type out map options GM map options and we pass in the starting latitude longitude points.



77

00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:25.170

So LHC is equal to zero.



78

00:06:25.180 --> 00:06:28.960

LNG is equal to zero and then the zoom level will say three.



79

00:06:29.140 --> 00:06:30.670

You can play around these values.



80

00:06:30.680 --> 00:06:36.140

But basically this is where we're going to center our map at longitude latitude values of 0 and then



81

00:06:36.140 --> 00:06:39.020

we will have levels zoom be equal to 3.



82

00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:43.670

You can increase or decrease it depending on how zoomed into the map you want to be when you actually



83

00:06:43.670 --> 00:06:46.110

run this because we have the wheel zoom tool.



84

00:06:46.130 --> 00:06:49.130

We'll be able to zoom out ourselves later on.



85

00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.160

We have our map options set.



86

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:53.590

It's time to actually create the plot.



87

00:06:53.700 --> 00:07:00.680

We will say plot is equal to g mat or G map plots.



88

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:12.580

We need to find the x range equal to range 1 the and also the fine y range equal to range 1 the.



89

00:07:12.790 --> 00:07:20.590

And then the map options parameter is equal to the map options you just created so we can run that and



90

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:27.250

then offer this plot object we can say plot title text is equal to and this is whatever you want to



91

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.330

call your plot.



92

00:07:28.540 --> 00:07:32.250

We'll call this example plot.



93

00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:42.220

And then finally we're going to need to set our plot API Ickey we will say plot dot API key is equal



94

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:47.040

to and then go ahead and copy and paste your Google API key there.



95

00:07:47.050 --> 00:07:51.090

So for instance I can say have an input here API key.



96

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:58.270

Run this and I will pay Sinema API key and then select enter and now its time to actually draw our points



97

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:05.970

onto the map we just created we will say source is equal to and will be using column data source here.



98

00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:15.860

And then we will do the following data is equal to a dictionary call where Latt is equal to Latz an



99

00:08:16.130 --> 00:08:21.880

L O N is equal to Longs and that's what we're going to be providing.



100

00:08:22.110 --> 00:08:27.270

So we'll put in a new line here and makes this all goes in the same cell.



101

00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:29.000

Otherwise you make errors.



102

00:08:29.430 --> 00:08:37.500

Well the circle is equal to that circle import we did well say X is a string long.



103

00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.690

Why is the string Latz.



104

00:08:40.830 --> 00:08:45.090

And here you can play around the sizes so we'll say size 15.



105

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:47.550

You can also play around with the fill color.



106

00:08:47.550 --> 00:08:53.370

So the stakes and basic strings that represent the basic colors basically any Crayola colors such as



107

00:08:53.370 --> 00:08:56.780

red green blue will say the colors red.



108

00:08:56.820 --> 00:09:04.180

You can also indicate a fill alpha so that just basically indicates the transparency of the dots that



109

00:09:04.180 --> 00:09:05.660

we were going to plot.



110

00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:12.330

And then if you want a line color you can add one in but we'll just go ahead and say that's all we want.



111

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:16.600

Then in the same cell will plot add glyph



112

00:09:20.550 --> 00:09:22.970

and we'll say source and circle.



113

00:09:22.980 --> 00:09:27.870

This basically adds these what are called glyphs of the plot the circles themselves.



114

00:09:27.870 --> 00:09:34.400

So we're adding on the circles and then we're also going to add on the tools plot tools.



115

00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.250

And these are the tools that we imported earlier things like the pan tool the wheels zoom tool and the



116

00:09:39.250 --> 00:09:40.470

box select tool.



117

00:09:40.690 --> 00:09:43.180

I will copy and paste all these here.



118

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.750

Into ad tools.



119

00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.760

And we actually need to add instances of them.



120

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:49.630

So we need to actually call them.



121

00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:55.020

So at an open and close parentheses at the end of these.



122

00:09:55.160 --> 00:10:06.840

And then you can say output file and we'll call this my example GM map plot h T.M..



123

00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:13.560

So create a little steam l file and then we're going to call show the actual plot.



124

00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:16.940

So let's run this again to make sure this all goes in the same cell.



125

00:10:17.100 --> 00:10:23.280

And when you run that you should get a new tab open and something that looks like this he Rikan see



126

00:10:23.620 --> 00:10:28.210

we went ahead and plotted all the points and these points what they actually represent are just from



127

00:10:28.210 --> 00:10:29.190

the United Nations.



128

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:33.940

It's essentially a point at around the center of every country in the world.



129

00:10:33.940 --> 00:10:37.420

So here we see all the points around the countries of the world.



130

00:10:37.420 --> 00:10:43.300

If you go back and forth really fast sometimes it takes a little while to catch up with the API so we



131

00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.250

can see here it takes a little time to catch up.



132

00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:49.810

But go ahead just move it around and eventually it will get unstuck and you can also check out the tools



133

00:10:49.810 --> 00:10:51.380

here such as box select.



134

00:10:51.430 --> 00:10:57.100

If you only want to highlight certain points of the map or if you want to zoom in and out you can use



135

00:10:57.100 --> 00:10:58.210

the wheel zoom here.



136

00:10:58.210 --> 00:11:02.670

So it's a wheel zoom tool and you can use that to zoom in or zoom out.



137

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:03.610

All right.



138

00:11:03.610 --> 00:11:08.410

That's the basics of plotting with Python and Bocca as long as you have the Google Maps API.



139

00:11:08.590 --> 00:11:09.700

It should have all worked for you.



140

00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:11.420

Let's quickly review what we did.



141

00:11:11.530 --> 00:11:13.570

We'll scroll back up here.



142

00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:15.640

The first part which is getting the data.



143

00:11:15.730 --> 00:11:18.490

So oftentimes we'll have that data in a CXXVI file.



144

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:23.950

Eventually what you need to do is create a list a python list the latitudes and a python list the longitudes



145

00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.450

with the data as floating point numbers.



146

00:11:26.470 --> 00:11:30.640

So if you're reading it in the CSC file it will probably be read in automatically as a string.



147

00:11:30.850 --> 00:11:35.770

So you can go ahead and use the float function that's built into Python to convert those into floating



148

00:11:35.770 --> 00:11:36.890

point numbers.



149

00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:42.340

Once you've done that you'll want to do your imports from book at the ISO that's output file and show



150

00:11:42.700 --> 00:11:47.360

in order to show the file and create the HTL file at the end and then from both models.



151

00:11:47.410 --> 00:11:49.360

Import these useful functions.



152

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:55.330

Then you set your map options set starting latitude and longitude and then the zoom level you can play



153

00:11:55.330 --> 00:11:56.430

around with those.



154

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:03.640

Then the next step is actually create the plot we call GM map plot passen x range in y range as instances



155

00:12:03.700 --> 00:12:09.850

of this range one the shift tab here if it's in range when the basically just says that it's continuous



156

00:12:09.910 --> 00:12:16.330

scalar dimension in the x axis and y axis of the map and then we have the map options equal to the map



157

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:21.000

options you created before then if you want to set the text title you can do that right here.



158

00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:26.970

Set your API key to the Google Maps API and then make sure the rest of this all goes in a single cell.



159

00:12:26.980 --> 00:12:32.020

You set your source for the column data you pass in your lab Tizen longitudes in the sort of dictionary



160

00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:32.960

format.



161

00:12:33.220 --> 00:12:35.680

Then you indicate where you want circles.



162

00:12:35.680 --> 00:12:38.230

There's other things complot like squares and triangles.



163

00:12:38.410 --> 00:12:43.370

But the basic one is just plot circles say Xs l o n y is l t.



164

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.950

Set the size you can play around with that fill color.



165

00:12:45.970 --> 00:12:51.490

Play around with that and the fill alpha player on that as well and that actual glyph that is the source



166

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:52.510

and circle.



167

00:12:52.630 --> 00:12:57.740

So it matches up these circles to every source every latitude longitude coordinate.



168

00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:02.170

Then we add the tools that is the pan tool the wheels zoom tool in the box select tool.



169

00:13:02.170 --> 00:13:04.620

We create our output file and then we show the plot.



170

00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:09.260

So we can see something that looks like this at the end of the day ok.



171

00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:12.840

Hopefully that's enough for you to continue on your mission.



172

00:13:12.870 --> 00:13:13.860

We'll see you there agent.
