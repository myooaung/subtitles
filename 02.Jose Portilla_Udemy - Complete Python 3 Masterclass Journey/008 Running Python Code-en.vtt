00:00:00.880 --> 00:00:05.320

All right recruit so you've installed anti-condom Python onto your computer.



2

00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:08.560

Now we just need to discuss how to actually run Python code.



3

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:12.380

Now there are several ways to run Python code.



4

00:00:12.460 --> 00:00:17.980

But first let's have a quick discussion on the various options for development environments.



5

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:24.800

There are three main types of development environments text editors full ID's and notebook environments.



6

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:32.880

Text editors are basically just general editors that work for any sort of text file and they're generalized



7

00:00:32.910 --> 00:00:38.290

meaning they can work for a variety of programming languages and work of a variety of file types.



8

00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:43.740

They can be customize if additional plugins and add ons to give them looks feels an extra functionality



9

00:00:44.130 --> 00:00:45.490

that a user may want.



10

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.210

However for general text editors you should keep in mind that most are not designed with only Python



11

00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:52.200

in mind.



12

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:55.800

They're designed to be general text editors for a variety of languages.



13

00:00:55.860 --> 00:01:01.980

The most popular text editors currently are probably subline text and Adam with Sublime Text probably



14

00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:06.110

being one of the most popular development environments for just a variety of languages.



15

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:10.830

Then we come to fool IDs.



16

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:14.370

IDS stands for Integrated development environments.



17

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:19.580

The fool idea is a development environment specifically designed for Python.



18

00:01:19.670 --> 00:01:25.340

This is ideal for larger programs or when you're working at a company where everyone should have the



19

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:30.710

same working environment to have the same look feel and basically protocol for designing code.



20

00:01:30.710 --> 00:01:35.960

You should keep in mind that integrated development environments typically are produced by some sort



21

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:36.490

of company.



22

00:01:36.500 --> 00:01:40.880

So you need to pay for them and only their community editions are free.



23

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:45.710

Now they are designed specifically for Python so they have tons of extra functionality.



24

00:01:45.820 --> 00:01:47.820

But sometimes that may feel bloated.



25

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:51.510

Especially if you just want to quickly write a small script.



26

00:01:51.580 --> 00:01:56.110

The most popular fool ideas for Python are pite charm and spider.



27

00:01:56.170 --> 00:02:03.480

And if you install the full Anaconda python distribution you actually already have spider with the install.



28

00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:09.160

Finally there's notebook environments that spooky environments are really great for learning.



29

00:02:09.160 --> 00:02:14.830

They like to see input output right next to each other but even better than that they actually support



30

00:02:14.950 --> 00:02:21.730

inline marked down notes visualisations videos and more meaning you can actually take notes that are



31

00:02:21.730 --> 00:02:26.860

not code basically just little notes for yourself explaining the code and then right below it you can



32

00:02:26.860 --> 00:02:32.810

have a little cell that actually runs code where you should note though is that they actually require



33

00:02:32.870 --> 00:02:39.980

a special file format that is not a PI file and because it's not a PI file you can't really double click



34

00:02:40.070 --> 00:02:42.130

on a notebook file on your computer.



35

00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:46.250

You need to open it through that Jupiter notebook environment which will show you how to do it just



36

00:02:46.250 --> 00:02:52.010

a little bit looping environments are also typically not suitable for really large projects have multiple



37

00:02:52.010 --> 00:02:52.840

files.



38

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:57.260

They're better for just learning how to code and really small quick projects.



39

00:02:57.260 --> 00:03:03.010

If you want a larger script or larger program maybe check out text editors or full IDs.



40

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:08.390

The most popular notebook environment for Python is the Jupiter notebook.



41

00:03:08.490 --> 00:03:14.010

Now the most important thing to know is that development environments are a very personal choice.



42

00:03:14.010 --> 00:03:17.500

That's really why the pen on your personal preference.



43

00:03:17.580 --> 00:03:22.980

Some people really love the Jupiter note book environment and they actually use do you note book environment



44

00:03:23.310 --> 00:03:25.520

for developing really large projects.



45

00:03:25.530 --> 00:03:31.170

Peter Norvig who's the director of research at Google is a big fan of the Jupiter notebook system.



46

00:03:31.170 --> 00:03:36.690

Other people really like the notebooks they don't like that it opens in your browser and they prefer



47

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.350

text editors that they're used to.



48

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:40.380

Or maybe they prefer ideas.



49

00:03:40.470 --> 00:03:46.470

And typically programmers who are very experienced in another language tend to prefer ideas or text



50

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.380

editors because it's a smoother transition for them.



51

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.880

Whatever your preference is choose whichever development environment you prefer.



52

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.810

Well we're going to do now is explore how to actually run Python code.



53

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:05.450

We're first going to explore with an editor to create a PI script and then run the file at your command



54

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:06.050

line.



55

00:04:06.200 --> 00:04:10.820

Then we're going to explore how to run code in a Jupiter notebook and the various extra features of



56

00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.020

the Jupiter notebook throughout your training in your bootcamp.



57

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:15.530

We'll be using Jupiter notebooks.



58

00:04:15.590 --> 00:04:19.820

But again please feel free to use whatever development environment you prefer.



59

00:04:19.820 --> 00:04:23.670

It's quite a personal choice to actually work with an editor.



60

00:04:23.690 --> 00:04:25.220

We first need to download one.



61

00:04:25.370 --> 00:04:30.890

So we'll download the Sublime Text Editor and you can do that by going to w w w That's a blind text



62

00:04:30.970 --> 00:04:32.630

dot com.



63

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.650

All right here we are at Sublime Text dot com.



64

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.420

And typically it will of the text well operating system you're on and it will have a little button for



65

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:43.740

you saying download for OS Linux or Windows.



66

00:04:43.750 --> 00:04:49.360

It's a very simple text editor and it's probably the most popular text editor in the world and it has



67

00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:51.540

a really interesting pricing scheme.



68

00:04:51.550 --> 00:04:57.520

It's technically not free but they give you an unlimited free trial where they will just have a little



69

00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:01.930

pop up every once in a while asking you if you're ready to upgrade to buy it.



70

00:05:02.260 --> 00:05:07.980

So again it's technically not free but it has an unlimited free trial for the rest of your life.



71

00:05:08.050 --> 00:05:12.100

It will just have a little pop up asking you to purchase the full license.



72

00:05:12.100 --> 00:05:18.370

So click here on download and then select the download for your operating system either OS X Windows



73

00:05:18.430 --> 00:05:20.850

when the 64 bit or Linux.



74

00:05:20.860 --> 00:05:24.900

So typically what you should do is just go to the home page and then click whatever it download that



75

00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:26.360

is out of the text for you.



76

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:30.890

Once you've downloaded it we'll go ahead and open the Sublime Text Editor.



77

00:05:31.690 --> 00:05:37.390

Once you've downloaded and installed subline text you should be able to search your computer for Sublime



78

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:38.260

Text.



79

00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:38.970

Click on it.



80

00:05:39.040 --> 00:05:42.450

Open it up and it will look something like this.



81

00:05:42.580 --> 00:05:49.520

Next what we're going to do is actually type out some Python code and then save this as a dot PI script.



82

00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.520

Go ahead and type prints.



83

00:05:51.540 --> 00:05:59.920

Open and close parentheses and then in single quotes or double quotes hello world and this will be your



84

00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:07.510

first Python script and then select File Save As and the reason we're doing that is if you notice right



85

00:06:07.510 --> 00:06:14.470

now there's no syntax highlighting that is to say everything is the same color for this font so sublime



86

00:06:14.470 --> 00:06:17.710

text editor doesn't actually know that this is a Python script.



87

00:06:17.830 --> 00:06:20.360

What we want to do is save it as.



88

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:30.840

And we're going to call this file my example and you'll notice if you click on all files you have lots



89

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.170

of extensions to choose from.



90

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:36.890

We're going to choose to save it as a python file.



91

00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.350

So you're going to say my example save as a python file.



92

00:06:40.410 --> 00:06:47.740

The other option you can do is just select all files and then say my example and yourself right.



93

00:06:47.830 --> 00:06:48.560

PI.



94

00:06:48.750 --> 00:06:50.730

Either way is fine.



95

00:06:50.730 --> 00:06:53.540

Go ahead and save it making sure it's a dot PI file.



96

00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:59.400

Hit save and now you'll notice subline text editor understands that it's a python script file and it's



97

00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:02.980

performed syntax highlighting to help you read this.



98

00:07:03.030 --> 00:07:04.190

Print is a function.



99

00:07:04.230 --> 00:07:08.880

Hello world is a string and we're going to be learning a lot more about that and Python in general.



100

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.440

Later on in your training for now let's see how to actually run this script.



101

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:18.660

Remember that we've saved that to our desktop meaning at our command line.



102

00:07:18.660 --> 00:07:23.300

We need to change directories to our desktop so we can run the sexual up-I file.



103

00:07:23.430 --> 00:07:27.440

Go ahead and open up your command line.



104

00:07:27.510 --> 00:07:30.210

Since I'm on Windows I will open up a command prompt.



105

00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:36.930

If your on a Mac OS or Linux you'll open up a terminal then you'll want to change directory to your



106

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:47.740

actual desktop or wherever you say stop by file type CD and then desktop to change directory to your



107

00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:55.840

desktop and then what you should be able to do is type out Python space and then begin typing out the



108

00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:56.980

name of your file.



109

00:07:56.980 --> 00:08:03.130

In my case it was example that pi and to prove to yourself that we're in the correct location you should



110

00:08:03.130 --> 00:08:05.740

be able to hit tab and it will autocomplete.



111

00:08:05.740 --> 00:08:06.870

So here we say Python.



112

00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:13.610

My example does PI and this is how you can run a PI script at your command line enter.



113

00:08:13.750 --> 00:08:14.930

Then you should be able to see.



114

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.650

Hello world.



115

00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:22.960

Now you successfully created a Python script in your text editor and you ran that script at your command



116

00:08:22.960 --> 00:08:23.490

line.



117

00:08:24.290 --> 00:08:29.190

Well you can also do is just type python by itself at your command line.



118

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:37.220

Hit enter and this is a very simple direct connection to Python allowing you to type python code directly



119

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:38.560

at your command line.



120

00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:43.400

We won't really be using this throughout your training because it's only one line at a time and eventually



121

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.870

we'll be using and learning about writing more than one line at a time for code.



122

00:08:47.890 --> 00:08:52.060

You can also just check it out type prints hello



123

00:08:54.690 --> 00:08:56.600

enter in your notice you have hello.



124

00:08:56.610 --> 00:08:57.450

As the output.



125

00:08:57.450 --> 00:08:59.440

So this basically one line at a time.



126

00:08:59.550 --> 00:09:06.630

You can write Python code then we can type quit open and close parentheses enter and leave quit out



127

00:09:06.630 --> 00:09:09.200

of the Python interpreter.



128

00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:14.490

All right so we just learned how to actually run a Python script at your command line.



129

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:20.690

Now let's explore the Jupiter notebook environment and see how that works to do so will go to our Anaconda



130

00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:26.700

Navigator so search your computer for Anaconda navigator.



131

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:32.230

Open that up and then once you've done that go ahead and launch the Jupiter notebook.



132

00:09:32.230 --> 00:09:38.990

Once you click on that launch button you should notice that your browser automatically opens up to localhost



133

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:40.000

colon either.



134

00:09:40.090 --> 00:09:46.090

8 8 8 8 or 8 8 8 9 or some other series of numbers.



135

00:09:46.090 --> 00:09:52.480

Keep in mind that while Jupiter notebook does operate inside of your browser it does not require an



136

00:09:52.540 --> 00:09:53.590

internet connection.



137

00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.600

Everything is happening locally.



138

00:09:55.630 --> 00:10:00.070

There's no Internet connection between Jupiter and some other server somewhere.



139

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:07.060

It just happens to open up an opera in your browser as a convenient graphical interface for you to program



140

00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:08.090

in.



141

00:10:08.140 --> 00:10:14.210

So once you launch Jupiter notebook he'll notice that you can view all the files on your computer.



142

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:20.330

For example we can click here on the desktop folder and now I can see that my example that postscript



143

00:10:20.390 --> 00:10:26.780

we had just created earlier and using it in an opaque system you can actually add on and edit that py



144

00:10:26.780 --> 00:10:27.470

files.



145

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:30.530

So for example we could add on another print statement here.



146

00:10:31.500 --> 00:10:35.300

Knew and then saved this change so we could say save.



147

00:10:35.550 --> 00:10:40.560

And then we could also download or rename the file and a bunch of other stuff but we're not going to



148

00:10:40.560 --> 00:10:43.090

be using Jupiter for this sort of text editing.



149

00:10:43.290 --> 00:10:45.380

It's probably better to use subline text editor.



150

00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:47.680

But again it's personal preference.



151

00:10:47.700 --> 00:10:52.560

What we're really going to be using Jupiter and Jupiter for is the notebook system so you can click



152

00:10:52.560 --> 00:10:57.330

here where it says new and under notebook you should see Python 3.



153

00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.950

Sometimes it says can the route or something else but click on what it says under notebook.



154

00:11:01.980 --> 00:11:04.760

Typically it says Python 3.



155

00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.580

And then you'll notice that we just started a new notebook.



156

00:11:07.630 --> 00:11:11.230

So let's have a quick overview of what this actually is.



157

00:11:11.230 --> 00:11:12.450

Here it says untitled.



158

00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:15.970

And that's because this notebook that we just created doesn't actually have a title.



159

00:11:15.970 --> 00:11:22.120

And if we click back here to the other tab you'll notice we just created an untitled IP IPY and B file



160

00:11:22.390 --> 00:11:24.840

that stands for each Python notebook file.



161

00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:30.330

Jupiter notebooks used to be called I Python notebooks so they kept the file extension name.



162

00:11:30.570 --> 00:11:36.630

And if we want to change this name all we have to do is go back to this tab select on title and give



163

00:11:36.630 --> 00:11:44.970

her a notebook a new name so we will say my first notebook enter and we have renamed the notebook as



164

00:11:44.970 --> 00:11:46.520

well as the actual file.



165

00:11:46.530 --> 00:11:51.570

You'll notice now it says my first notebook the python notebook extension.



166

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:58.680

So coming back to this notebook the notebook uses a cell based system meaning you write code in a cell.



167

00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:01.500

You run the cell and then see the actual output.



168

00:12:01.530 --> 00:12:02.790

Right below the cell.



169

00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:10.810

So let's try running or simple print statement inside of a cell type print but close print sees Hello.



170

00:12:10.950 --> 00:12:15.870

And you notice that Jupiter autocomplete somethings for you such as quotes or parentheses.



171

00:12:15.870 --> 00:12:17.640

And then we can run the cell.



172

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:22.740

So you can click here on the run button and it will run the cell and you'll see the output directly



173

00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:23.780

below.



174

00:12:23.790 --> 00:12:28.530

This is a great system for people who are just starting to learn about Python because they quickly iterate



175

00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.370

and fix mistakes because they have their code and they can see the output directly.



176

00:12:33.420 --> 00:12:37.460

They don't have to be constantly going to the command line and running their scripts again.



177

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.670

It's definitely a personal preference but this is a nice feature of the notebook for people that are



178

00:12:41.670 --> 00:12:42.920

learning Python.



179

00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:48.220

And you notice that we automatically create an other cell below which you can type more Python code



180

00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:51.090

in for example print new.



181

00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:57.850

And if you don't want to have to click that run button every time all you have to do is do shift enter



182

00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:03.150

and that will run a cell again that's shift enter to run a cell.



183

00:13:03.220 --> 00:13:07.080

If you just enter by itself you'll just create more new lines.



184

00:13:07.180 --> 00:13:09.850

So it's shift and tert to run a cell.



185

00:13:09.850 --> 00:13:16.360

There's lots of other useful hockeys where you can click on Help and then hit keyboard shortcuts and



186

00:13:16.360 --> 00:13:18.480

it will list all the keyboard shortcuts.



187

00:13:18.610 --> 00:13:24.250

The most useful ones will be teaching you later on but you can always explore that yourself.



188

00:13:24.250 --> 00:13:29.740

Now we also discussed that the notebook system can actually hold Mark down text that is just normal



189

00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:35.110

text that is not code that you can't just use for yourself to type out notes as you're learning throughout



190

00:13:35.110 --> 00:13:36.790

this bootcamp.



191

00:13:36.860 --> 00:13:41.840

So if you click on a cell you'll notice here it says code and that's because this is currently a python



192

00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:46.140

code cell if you want to make it into just a normal markdown cell.



193

00:13:46.250 --> 00:13:49.160

Select from this dropdown marked down.



194

00:13:49.190 --> 00:13:51.670

And now this is no longer a code cell.



195

00:13:51.770 --> 00:13:55.620

It's just a cell that will just have normal text in it.



196

00:13:55.730 --> 00:13:59.580

And you'll notice that it no longer has this in right in front of the cell.



197

00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.420

So that also indicates that it's just for normal text.



198

00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:10.430

So here you can write yourself just notes that will help you understand and if you do shift enter it



199

00:14:10.430 --> 00:14:12.590

will then display them as just a normal text.



200

00:14:12.590 --> 00:14:17.720

So again this is no longer code it's just text for yourself and a lot of the notebooks we provide throughout



201

00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:21.710

your training will have marked down text as explanation.



202

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:27.570

And if you ever want to write another code so you can just sit on a cell and then make sure that selected



203

00:14:27.590 --> 00:14:31.240

code should be able to print whatever you want here.



204

00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.540

Shift and try to run that.



205

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:37.360

And that's the very basics we'll be talking a lot more about notebooks later on throughout your training.



206

00:14:37.520 --> 00:14:39.410

But that's really the basics.



207

00:14:39.410 --> 00:14:47.030

The last thing I want to note is that this special extension of the notebook file this IPY and B means



208

00:14:47.030 --> 00:14:51.920

that you actually can't double click on this file on your computer and expect it to open.



209

00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:54.820

So let me show you what I mean by that very quickly.



210

00:14:55.010 --> 00:15:00.890

You'll notice that if I come to my desktop I can see here my example that pi and if I double click on



211

00:15:00.890 --> 00:15:04.990

this it will actually open up in whatever default program I have for it.



212

00:15:05.090 --> 00:15:10.910

Typically Sublime Text Editor or whatever other editors you have on your computer so you can double



213

00:15:10.910 --> 00:15:13.970

click on that py files edit them and work with them.



214

00:15:13.970 --> 00:15:20.720

However if you try double clicking on a IPY and B file you'll end up getting something asking you how



215

00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:25.310

do you want to open this file or it will just kind of open up and you'll just see a bunch of scrambled



216

00:15:25.310 --> 00:15:26.120

code.



217

00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:32.590

That means that you can only open the special notebook files through the Jupiter notebook system still



218

00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:38.330

have to open up Anaconda navigator launch a Jupiter notebook and then actually find it throughout your



219

00:15:38.330 --> 00:15:40.830

computer and click on it.



220

00:15:40.850 --> 00:15:44.190

All right that's the very basics of running Python code.



221

00:15:44.210 --> 00:15:46.290

It's time to actually learn Python.



222

00:15:46.370 --> 00:15:47.300

We'll see there recruit.
