00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000
who had always welcome to the session decision could have even going to know about the

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.350
services those services which you will learn into the spirit of Louis schools.

00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:13.800
So you know,

00:00:13.800 --> 00:00:21.070
these as these services are basically very important and very major services kind off the

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:25.150
pillar services which AWS when it started club computing,

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.290
they started with these services.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:34.980
So let's start one by one with these services and you will come to know that what answer

00:00:34.980 --> 00:00:37.480
this particularly they do for you.

00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:47.600
So the first services are easy to so in need of Louis is it is one of the easy to is a

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:55.800
major services which on which you mostly won't work easy to means and what yourself,

00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:56.030
us.

00:00:56.030 --> 00:00:57.690
Whenever you have to create anywhere,

00:00:57.690 --> 00:00:58.320
Joseph us,

00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:02.420
you need toe use easy to service apart from this,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:07.460
easy to also provide you the option that you can host your website and is it?

00:01:07.460 --> 00:01:11.760
So when you will go around with easy to section,

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:17.540
you will come to know that how to how you can host of upside and we will follow our demo

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:17.960
for that.

00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.320
Apart from this,

00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:25.890
there are awesome featured easy to just call load balancing and auto scale,

00:01:25.890 --> 00:01:29.950
so brewer balancing will ensure that how whatever their traffic comes,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:34.010
do your self worth are to your website.

00:01:34.010 --> 00:01:39.140
It will get automatically distribute among all the available settles if there are any sort

00:01:39.140 --> 00:01:45.250
of us behind a website so the Lord will get distributed or dramatically behind those,

00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.400
he said.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:46.750
Worse,

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.850
if one got somewhere bowed down,

00:01:48.850 --> 00:01:51.530
so then it automatically label.

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:58.180
Deduct that we said What is down on it will ensure that the Web traffic does not goto the

00:01:58.180 --> 00:01:59.140
dancer down.

00:01:59.140 --> 00:01:59.510
So what?

00:01:59.510 --> 00:02:00.420
And it will.

00:02:00.420 --> 00:02:06.500
It will automatically distribute that their search traffic among the available to servers.

00:02:06.500 --> 00:02:08.900
Apart from this,

00:02:08.900 --> 00:02:12.080
there is a future which is called auto scaling.

00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.150
And again it is a very good feature.

00:02:14.150 --> 00:02:18.170
Why?

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:23.110
Because many works with Lord balancing it become very powerful.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:24.080
And,

00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:24.920
uh,

00:02:24.920 --> 00:02:27.250
you can set up like this,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:33.340
that if you're website or if you were getting a lot of traffic and you need another most

00:02:33.340 --> 00:02:34.170
one more server,

00:02:34.170 --> 00:02:40.010
you can set up with auto scaling and their server that news available automatically good

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:41.670
created if required.

00:02:41.670 --> 00:02:43.330
If it doesn't require,

00:02:43.330 --> 00:02:43.740
it,

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:46.000
will automatically down the nuclear to serve,

00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.140
so that is fantastic future.

00:02:49.140 --> 00:02:52.840
And in this course we are going toe See all their demos,

00:02:52.840 --> 00:03:00.110
like how we can create everywhere side how toe Use your balancing on auto scaling with

00:03:00.110 --> 00:03:00.750
demos?

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:03.680
No,

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:06.250
Next on this is called a devious.

00:03:06.250 --> 00:03:08.470
Devious is the story service,

00:03:08.470 --> 00:03:10.450
which is available in eight of Louis,

00:03:10.450 --> 00:03:11.400
Uh,

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.640
even is particularly is called block with stories,

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:16.660
and it is used for servers.

00:03:16.660 --> 00:03:18.990
So whenever you create what you answer was,

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:22.710
you need to assign the hard disk and obvious does it for you.

00:03:22.710 --> 00:03:24.410
So why you Yes,

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.400
you can assign the volumes to serve us,

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:29.180
and you can manage them easily.

00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:34.680
Next services out of totally this is your aws being a server.

00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:40.680
Maybe most off you might be already aware about the inner server and if you don't know

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.550
about it much,

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:47.950
you will going toe know about this invented in this course.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:52.730
So what out of the tree does do route off duty service?

00:03:52.730 --> 00:03:53.240
Basically,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:59.550
its primary function is to map your domain MEP your website domain o map your domain name

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.310
with the I P address.

00:04:01.310 --> 00:04:03.060
Apart from this,

00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.340
you can also set up various policies.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:09.420
Why are out for 2 30 like you can set up Bridget Policy,

00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:14.610
you can set up who primary feel over 1st 2nd facility.

00:04:14.610 --> 00:04:16.610
Like if your primary several goes down,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:19.450
then it will automatically it off to secondary server.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:22.320
There are other policies of also available,

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.960
like latency policy do location policy.

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:30.280
And we were going to discuss it in about in discuss about it in detail.

00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:32.800
And we will see the demos for them too.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:36.890
Okay,

00:04:36.890 --> 00:04:42.420
Next service that is called I am Identity Access and Management and into service We will

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:47.150
know about how we can restrict our resources toe excessive publican.

00:04:47.150 --> 00:04:51.950
So it is not like this there to anybody can access our sources.

00:04:51.950 --> 00:04:58.480
There is a future of a liberal in eight of yours which we can use and we can ensure that

00:04:58.480 --> 00:05:05.060
the authorized the sources only can access that every legal services esta is this important

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:09.710
story service Another story solution provided by AWS and in very much in demand.

00:05:09.710 --> 00:05:11.060
Why I asked,

00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:15.650
you can store your as many flights up to five terabytes.

00:05:15.650 --> 00:05:22.650
15 size could be up to five terabytes and you can upload as many s off.

00:05:22.650 --> 00:05:23.350
That's you want.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:30.240
It is basically a object business stories and it is used for uploading your fires,

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:33.230
Uprooting your videos and lots of data in shape.

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:38.860
Off files you can upload and it is very popular solution right now,

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:47.270
and various companies are using this service because it is very cheap also and vetted again

00:05:47.270 --> 00:05:49.060
in aws VPC,

00:05:49.060 --> 00:05:50.210
you are going toe,

00:05:50.210 --> 00:05:50.960
you will go.

00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:57.030
You will going to learn about the network how you can set up your own company network

00:05:57.030 --> 00:06:00.070
rather than only using public network,

00:06:00.070 --> 00:06:02.360
which is provided by AWS in the fall.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.480
You can set up your own network to,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.440
and it is very flexible and you can easily set up in universe.

00:06:09.440 --> 00:06:16.850
So very interesting topic on and billions of stopping a major topic.

00:06:16.850 --> 00:06:18.850
You definitely need to learn this.

00:06:18.850 --> 00:06:20.930
Another solution.

00:06:20.930 --> 00:06:27.240
A loveless ideas service by which you can use it arrested out with services.

00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.050
Whatever the various databases services available in this market,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:44.510
like a school's over my sequel article and what is other open source databases like Mario

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.960
TV on the party's most many of the Opens,

00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:54.830
there are services are off label no and supported by AWS rds.

00:06:54.830 --> 00:06:56.760
It also support dynamodb,

00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.750
which is AWS own delivery solution,

00:06:59.750 --> 00:07:02.720
which is which works on No,

00:07:02.720 --> 00:07:03.950
no,

00:07:03.950 --> 00:07:05.850
no database table.

00:07:05.850 --> 00:07:13.580
Basically dynamodb is a no sequel or did have a solution where you will not use did abysses

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:13.580
.

00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:17.050
You directly create tables and you can directly simply create.

00:07:17.050 --> 00:07:26.200
It is very cheap solution and it is very much popular in gaming solution and we're not much

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.650
complex square is required.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:36.500
Aws dynamodb is another fantastic solution provided by by AWS yourself and it was almost

00:07:36.500 --> 00:07:42.260
equal This That means that there will be no database,

00:07:42.260 --> 00:07:43.600
particularly database,

00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.810
not need to create it.

00:07:44.810 --> 00:07:51.200
It only gave us I very simple to use.

00:07:51.200 --> 00:07:57.520
I will show you in their demo even going toe see their demo off this on it is very

00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:00.390
interesting and very popular restaurant.

00:08:00.390 --> 00:08:06.790
Another solution is cloudwatch flood watches and monitoring solution in aws Why a

00:08:06.790 --> 00:08:07.330
cloudwatch?

00:08:07.330 --> 00:08:13.220
You can monitor each and every resource in your environment Very simple toe set up on

00:08:13.220 --> 00:08:18.250
another quite reasonable and quite popular solution.

00:08:18.250 --> 00:08:24.870
Little Migration service In AWS there are a lot of data magicians service available in AWS

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:24.870
.

00:08:24.870 --> 00:08:28.980
If you are migrating your environment toe cloud environment,

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:35.400
there are really a solution of label like that connect snowball VPN many solutions are

00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.190
available and we will go through this in the last,

00:08:40.190 --> 00:08:43.800
we will look upon it ablaze.

00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:45.150
Global certification exam.

00:08:45.150 --> 00:08:45.510
Tibbs,

00:08:45.510 --> 00:08:46.180
What?

00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:48.290
The services you need to follow.

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:50.700
And what are the important questions?

00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:54.220
What could be the so not use can Come on.

00:08:54.220 --> 00:08:54.780
What?

00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:59.640
The specific things you need to follow to clear their global exam on those tapes will be

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.700
available in this section.

00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:03.900
So I hope you will win Toe Landis.

00:09:03.900 --> 00:09:13.960
So you were going toe learn aws very well and can follow these simple tips if you go,

00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:15.630
it looks like this.

00:09:15.630 --> 00:09:19.100
If you go to the console once after signing in,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.190
you need to choose your nearest isn't.

00:09:22.190 --> 00:09:25.140
And here you can find all the services.

00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:33.700
So just a look for console Does a similar just make you family every day that this console

00:09:33.700 --> 00:09:39.980
and here you can see whatever the services which we discuss we were going to learn here so

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:49.670
you can complete section You can see easy toe S t on dynamodb rds.

00:09:49.670 --> 00:09:51.720
Whatever the service which we was discussing,

00:09:51.720 --> 00:09:57.270
all are available here with this VPC direct connect out of 23 cloudfront bless here.

00:09:57.270 --> 00:10:04.670
All of the services we're going to learn in this course If he look on these sections,

00:10:04.670 --> 00:10:08.930
there are various So this is available as off now.

00:10:08.930 --> 00:10:10.790
But when aws it started,

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:16.690
it started with the limited number off services and over the time they have included new

00:10:16.690 --> 00:10:17.770
services Time,

00:10:17.770 --> 00:10:18.160
good time.

00:10:18.160 --> 00:10:21.780
But if you're looking for AWS solution architect course,

00:10:21.780 --> 00:10:26.550
the media services which you need to learn is in computer section.

00:10:26.550 --> 00:10:27.220
If you look,

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:34.250
it is easy to elastic beanstalk on then if you go to stories,

00:10:34.250 --> 00:10:35.200
it is a story.

00:10:35.200 --> 00:10:45.610
Ffs Gless here on the stories Get away Indeed Abi's rds dynamodb last cash in networking It

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:53.320
is vpc cloudfront direct connect Rafto Totally All are important Onda in migration for

00:10:53.320 --> 00:11:03.470
solution architect or for the AWS major services the important services snowball Then it is

00:11:03.470 --> 00:11:12.040
only 22 develops the section management tool In this section we need to learn cloudwatch

00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:13.130
cloud formation.

00:11:13.130 --> 00:11:17.010
Andi no,

00:11:17.010 --> 00:11:20.480
for the requirement here then insecurity,

00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:27.980
identity and complaint section You can need to learn I am for the exam purpose and I am is

00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:37.200
very important for this itiveness also want to do this is artificial intelligence.

00:11:37.200 --> 00:11:37.670
However,

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:45.190
it is not part of the course and it normally notice to company the course as well another

00:11:45.190 --> 00:11:50.420
important services like SCS and send us which we need to learn.

00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.160
And we were learning the scores as well.

00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:57.610
Who does it?

00:11:57.610 --> 00:11:58.160
Guys?

00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:02.030
We have covered all of the major services which we need,

00:12:02.030 --> 00:12:03.650
which we learn in the scores.

00:12:03.650 --> 00:12:10.860
And I hope you will enjoy this Sunday a lot and do share your feedback once you go to do

00:12:10.860 --> 00:12:11.720
with scores.

Thank you.

00:12:17.670 --> 00:12:18.770
Thank you for decision,

00:12:18.770 --> 00:12:19.550
but
