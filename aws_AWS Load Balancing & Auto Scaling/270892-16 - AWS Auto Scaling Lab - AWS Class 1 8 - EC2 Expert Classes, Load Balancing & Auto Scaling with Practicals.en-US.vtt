00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.850
so Hello,

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:04.130
guys.

00:00:04.130 --> 00:00:09.160
Welcome to this video Onda and this video.

00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:11.600
This is basically a lab for auto scaling.

00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:17.420
We re learn how we can set up auto scaling for issue to on it.

00:00:17.420 --> 00:00:24.280
ISS We will check with North balancer So because auto scaling will best work with nor

00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:24.750
balancer,

00:00:24.750 --> 00:00:25.740
it is your choice.

00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:31.070
You want to set up it with load balancer or not But it is obviously a good choice if you

00:00:31.070 --> 00:00:32.770
set up it with a load balancer.

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:36.420
So Esper,

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:39.230
our last lives Introductions,

00:00:39.230 --> 00:00:39.750
lights off!

00:00:39.750 --> 00:00:41.400
Load balancing and orders killing!

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.470
We have reached till this point and we was trying toe this.

00:00:46.470 --> 00:00:50.860
Get this picture been practically so.

00:00:50.860 --> 00:00:52.460
Tell love what we have done.

00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:57.710
We have set up one elastic load balancer here and that was working fine.

00:00:57.710 --> 00:01:03.700
We also it was able to put these two servers behind the load balancer.

00:01:03.700 --> 00:01:06.640
So this part also has been done.

00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:07.830
We have chosen food.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:08.690
Absolutely.

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:13.120
Jones have lived the June A in every liberated you'll be and no,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:13.950
we won't boot.

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.970
Set up our orders,

00:01:14.970 --> 00:01:15.350
Kelly.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:21.460
And now we will try to achieve that Orto Scalea Asper.

00:01:21.460 --> 00:01:28.730
This diagram One thing we need to keep in mind that Oscar auto scaling girls set up in two

00:01:28.730 --> 00:01:34.370
parts First is launched configuration and second is or setting up auto scaling group.

00:01:34.370 --> 00:01:36.890
So a launch configuration,

00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:37.400
Basically,

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:39.860
we set up a server image.

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:45.660
So we set up a configuration where he's decided the new service will be created.

00:01:45.660 --> 00:01:48.860
What will be water data it will contain.

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:51.430
And what What will be the minimum size?

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:52.110
However,

00:01:52.110 --> 00:01:53.690
the confusion we can change.

00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:02.760
But at least data Daredevil we picked by this configuration only so launched an physician

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:08.220
very created confusion which has information about new server ritually launched in order

00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:16.580
Skilling using am way So we should have We must have one Am I which will be used to launch

00:02:16.580 --> 00:02:22.170
a new server So we need any am I sort of which has the same data which we need for our new

00:02:22.170 --> 00:02:29.180
server to launch an auto school hope it clears setting a second part is setting up auto

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:32.730
scaling group in s in auto scaling group.

00:02:32.730 --> 00:02:33.200
Basically,

00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:39.220
we will define over our auto scaling policies like conditions on which basis of a new

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.620
server will get loaded so there could be multiple conditions.

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:44.250
In this particular example,

00:02:44.250 --> 00:02:47.120
we will put the CPI or ridership,

00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:47.860
which is,

00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.280
I believe,

00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.350
the best available option,

00:02:50.350 --> 00:02:55.150
however there are other options are so which you can set up and you can set up auto scaling

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:58.750
on Good policies are on those conditions.

00:02:58.750 --> 00:03:05.150
So let's go to this point.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:07.110
No,

00:03:07.110 --> 00:03:11.670
I have signed it into my AWS console.

00:03:11.670 --> 00:03:14.750
And if you go as I said that there are two parts.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:17.450
One is long confusion and second is Auto Scaling Group.

00:03:17.450 --> 00:03:20.350
So once I click on loans configuration,

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.790
I need to click this part,

00:03:21.790 --> 00:03:23.500
create Auto Scaling Group.

00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:32.860
And once I click on this here,

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:36.890
you can see the first part come good loans configuration.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:41.350
It is my Iemma and the news arrival deserter from to see anyway.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:45.650
And second is Great Auto Scaling Group,

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.230
where we have to decide a lot of Skilling Group and we have to maintain the number off in

00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:52.620
stances and their number.

00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:54.390
And what is status?

00:03:54.390 --> 00:03:57.850
No,

00:03:57.850 --> 00:04:00.780
rascally Coleman's configuration.

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:06.920
Here you can choose yourself basics of us.

00:04:06.920 --> 00:04:07.570
If you want,

00:04:07.570 --> 00:04:08.660
you can use it.

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:16.150
A Louis given the mice and it will create a pure server with the plane several.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:19.150
Basically it will not have any data.

00:04:19.150 --> 00:04:23.490
Martin in practical scenario or in production.

00:04:23.490 --> 00:04:30.060
This is normally notice that nor the case Normally we launch or normally we have to ready a

00:04:30.060 --> 00:04:30.550
server.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:36.900
And we want that there is some data which we want under it off.

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.050
The current servers should be there.

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:43.110
So the best practices that you keep your aim is ready.

00:04:43.110 --> 00:04:51.450
You create a my off your existing website existing server which for whom you want to launch

00:04:51.450 --> 00:04:53.910
the similar kind of server.

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:56.790
So we have to make an image.

00:04:56.790 --> 00:05:04.350
What I have done right now I have created one Vab city gaps The website which you have seen

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:04.350
.

00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:09.950
Uh if you go toe this easy toe,

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:17.410
I have to running servers out of this.

00:05:17.410 --> 00:05:19.220
I on one side.

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:19.390
What?

00:05:19.390 --> 00:05:20.950
I have portrayed one website.

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:30.680
You can very five from here and probably I have created when a major off the server When am

00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:31.630
I of the server?

00:05:31.630 --> 00:05:36.690
So that I'd know don't need to stall a Parchin need to set up this website Clinton again

00:05:36.690 --> 00:05:37.170
and again.

00:05:37.170 --> 00:05:39.070
So in order,

00:05:39.070 --> 00:05:39.470
Skilling,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:55.000
I will use one anyway which have the same later like this and I will use this phone so I to

00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.870
serve well ferocity.

00:05:56.870 --> 00:05:57.870
Calf Unlikely.

00:05:57.870 --> 00:05:58.140
Gone.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.830
Slept in the next step.

00:06:02.830 --> 00:06:05.850
I can set up my configuration if I want to change.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:07.820
If I want to go some higher configuration,

00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:09.600
I want myself for new.

00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.850
So I will have some more hard configuration.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:14.070
I can choose that one right now.

00:06:14.070 --> 00:06:15.490
I'm OK with my current.

00:06:15.490 --> 00:06:17.370
So what configuration?

00:06:17.370 --> 00:06:19.510
So I'm happy with this and I will go ahead.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:20.740
But if you want,

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:26.540
you can choose different configurations to and this part is available in loans

00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:27.280
configuration.

00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:36.290
Here I see you have seven launch configuration.

00:06:36.290 --> 00:06:46.040
The four adoptions I go again,

00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:51.730
the off before it Hard disk which was using their It was their ZB and it has my data,

00:06:51.730 --> 00:06:54.770
like a party in stolen my Web server settings.

00:06:54.770 --> 00:06:56.080
If you want to add new volumes,

00:06:56.080 --> 00:07:01.240
you can also do that here again.

00:07:01.240 --> 00:07:04.710
I need to make sure that my have the quiet port available.

00:07:04.710 --> 00:07:07.450
So I have a sturdy report that is fine with me.

00:07:07.450 --> 00:07:15.760
It is giving me when warning that I don't have this port open.

00:07:15.760 --> 00:07:16.680
Don't you to pour?

00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:20.780
So let's put me this sport in security.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:25.610
Good offs on Dhere.

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:27.040
I'll go and I heard it.

00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.720
May Ford and I heard as a search for two.

00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:38.280
I am okay if it can be connected with so many locations.

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:39.110
So that is fine.

00:07:39.110 --> 00:07:59.830
And here I too was no my security guard nearly because,

00:07:59.830 --> 00:08:01.600
you know it is repressed on.

00:08:01.600 --> 00:08:04.250
I have yesterday Venice's export boot.

00:08:04.250 --> 00:08:08.210
Now I just need to refresh it.

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.710
I need to review the configuration.

00:08:10.710 --> 00:08:13.840
So here you can see I use my Emmy,

00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.280
which have somebody said date on it.

00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.830
I am using 22 dot Micro.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:24.090
The new service you'll get ready will be off 22 dot micros confused.

00:08:24.090 --> 00:08:27.870
It has one,

00:08:27.870 --> 00:08:31.970
will you and secret group which are able to connect.

00:08:31.970 --> 00:08:32.300
Why?

00:08:32.300 --> 00:08:33.990
As to DP assess it,

00:08:33.990 --> 00:08:42.540
I am happy to use my I want to see our configuration key files.

00:08:42.540 --> 00:08:47.520
So I will use this one and I'll set up this configuration.

00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:53.410
So the confusion part has been ready on disk configuration.

00:08:53.410 --> 00:08:58.100
You can see you can verify Here it will be available in the launch configuration part if

00:08:58.100 --> 00:09:07.350
you go So this is my vegetable configuration is ready.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.410
And here are all the details.

00:09:09.410 --> 00:09:10.420
If you want to see,

00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:15.010
due to write my grow the configuration and whatever the other parts are there you can

00:09:15.010 --> 00:09:15.910
verify from here.

00:09:15.910 --> 00:09:17.800
So my configuration is ready till now.

00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:24.580
As off off now 11th off number Because it's 17 now,

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:26.180
the second part come into the picture,

00:09:26.180 --> 00:09:27.550
which is Auto Scaling Group.

00:09:27.550 --> 00:09:31.790
So I need to set up now here the orders killing policy.

00:09:31.790 --> 00:09:37.190
So I give this name I need to give a name to this auto scaling group.

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:44.470
So I say Web server or toe scaling group This is how many groups size group sizes that how

00:09:44.470 --> 00:09:46.880
maney several You want that it should have,

00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:52.600
at least So I said that at least I should have to service in my environment.

00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:59.550
Then the network part is by default taking the default part.

00:09:59.550 --> 00:10:02.220
And there are two Southerners in my reason.

00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:07.630
So I am moved by reason and there are two summers and I want that the new machines,

00:10:07.630 --> 00:10:09.440
which will get launch in,

00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:16.710
get located in these two southerners or two of liberty June's for that on the air purpose.

00:10:16.710 --> 00:10:19.460
So now a first I have a launch,

00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:24.160
it will be launched in tow a B south one B or one A.

00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:29.560
And the next time I will be every label in next June because I chosen to different servers

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:29.560
.

00:10:29.560 --> 00:10:31.780
If I choose only one sub net,

00:10:31.780 --> 00:10:35.080
then all the servant of servants will which will be launched.

00:10:35.080 --> 00:10:37.610
We'll get put into this.

00:10:37.610 --> 00:10:38.860
Don't only a piece out,

00:10:38.860 --> 00:10:40.550
one B which I don't want.

00:10:40.550 --> 00:10:43.390
Because if this Evelyn religion goes down,

00:10:43.390 --> 00:10:46.110
my holes are machines will be impacted.

00:10:46.110 --> 00:10:46.920
But if I,

00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:47.140
too,

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.760
was multiple,

00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:48.250
everybody,

00:10:48.250 --> 00:10:48.730
Jones,

00:10:48.730 --> 00:10:52.750
I can put one server hair and 17 and another June.

00:10:52.750 --> 00:10:55.080
So this is the best practice.

00:10:55.080 --> 00:10:55.890
Tutu's multiple,

00:10:55.890 --> 00:10:58.130
Every liberty juice for the our purpose.

00:10:58.130 --> 00:11:01.930
Then I go to add one setting.

00:11:01.930 --> 00:11:05.860
And here you can see that it says advanced settings Load,

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:06.440
balancer.

00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:10.750
And here you can choose received traffic one or more load balancer.

00:11:10.750 --> 00:11:13.310
So here you can choose your load,

00:11:13.310 --> 00:11:13.780
balancer,

00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:16.480
from which that you want that that traffic should come.

00:11:16.480 --> 00:11:19.470
So I have set up on north balance that here,

00:11:19.470 --> 00:11:27.520
this one and I I should I will use this Lord well and said I want that this load balancer

00:11:27.520 --> 00:11:32.190
traffic should come toe my auto scaling policy.

00:11:32.190 --> 00:11:35.550
So let's trailer Let it come.

00:11:35.550 --> 00:11:43.640
So here I want that this load balancer traffic should goto the daughter scaling group and

00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:47.430
here because it is application load balancers.

00:11:47.430 --> 00:11:53.490
So I need target good up information and the target group is associated this steps over TG

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:53.490
.

00:11:53.490 --> 00:11:56.550
So let's go back to auto scaling,

00:11:56.550 --> 00:12:00.490
setting and here because it is the application server.

00:12:00.490 --> 00:12:02.540
So I need target Group,

00:12:02.540 --> 00:12:04.150
which is contracts are busy.

00:12:04.150 --> 00:12:06.280
If you are using classic load balancer,

00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.550
you can choose it from here.

00:12:07.550 --> 00:12:14.940
Then the health check type healthy active on which you want that the health checkup should

00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:15.420
be done.

00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:18.800
Aws providing you with a basic monitoring off health checkup.

00:12:18.800 --> 00:12:21.200
And if who Your website,

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.210
if you are any instance goes down the alarm.

00:12:24.210 --> 00:12:30.710
All the information will be given by eight of Louis for you so that you can know you can

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:36.800
set up health check up on two things on elastic load balancer or issued in easy to if you

00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.320
select.

00:12:37.320 --> 00:12:38.770
If any issue to goes down,

00:12:38.770 --> 00:12:42.390
it will give you information on if you select e l B.

00:12:42.390 --> 00:12:47.450
If your elastic load balancer is not working that will that information will be given to

00:12:47.450 --> 00:12:49.350
you And what is the health?

00:12:49.350 --> 00:12:50.250
A grace period.

00:12:50.250 --> 00:12:54.030
So here you can see that the length of their time that was auto scaling.

00:12:54.030 --> 00:12:55.880
Wait before checking an instance.

00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:56.890
Help the status.

00:12:56.890 --> 00:13:01.140
So the grace period begins with when an instance common to service.

00:13:01.140 --> 00:13:03.470
If no values provided a default off,

00:13:03.470 --> 00:13:07.220
302nd will be used and thats zero for no grace period.

00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.190
So it is the length of time that orders killing V.

00:13:10.190 --> 00:13:11.570
It's before checking.

00:13:11.570 --> 00:13:12.200
In instance,

00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:17.050
Help the students so once and his stance come active.

00:13:17.050 --> 00:13:18.510
You want that?

00:13:18.510 --> 00:13:22.660
At least it will take five minutes approximately or whatever the time you want to give.

00:13:22.660 --> 00:13:34.990
Let's say I'll put it 2 40 30 minutes off 34 minutes or I would would like to go 33 minutes

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:34.990
.

00:13:34.990 --> 00:13:41.230
So I hope that my instance if any new new server got launch,

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:43.280
it should be stable in 20 minutes.

00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:45.490
So that is the health agree spirit.

00:13:45.490 --> 00:13:50.490
I want to give it its stance.

00:13:50.490 --> 00:13:51.910
Protection If you want that.

00:13:51.910 --> 00:13:52.750
Ah,

00:13:52.750 --> 00:13:55.560
whatever the seven news ever get launched,

00:13:55.560 --> 00:13:59.150
that shouldn't come down automatically,

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:02.820
and you want to make down by yourself.

00:14:02.820 --> 00:14:10.400
You can choose a stance production protect from scaling because I had no protect from ah,

00:14:10.400 --> 00:14:12.090
it will allow toe.

00:14:12.090 --> 00:14:16.460
I hope the server that Miss news ever can get launched.

00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:21.190
But if you want to protect from a scaling so that new servers dull,

00:14:21.190 --> 00:14:23.290
the new launch server will not get down.

00:14:23.290 --> 00:14:26.560
When the when the situation get to stabilize,

00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.390
you can just do this option,

00:14:28.390 --> 00:14:33.990
then the next part come they're aware of,

00:14:33.990 --> 00:14:38.810
we have to actually the actually have to set up the policies that actually have to set up

00:14:38.810 --> 00:14:39.650
the conditions.

00:14:39.650 --> 00:14:43.550
So I choosed here minimum two servers,

00:14:43.550 --> 00:14:46.720
the group size minimum to.

00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:48.420
But if you want to change it,

00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:49.750
you can too injured here.

00:14:49.750 --> 00:14:51.560
So here are two options.

00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:55.950
Give this group at initial size all you want scaling policies to use.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:57.860
So if I you want,

00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:04.750
you can choose your Skilling policies like scale between two group toe five instances.

00:15:04.750 --> 00:15:11.670
So you want that you your minimums are ushered with two and it can go toe of 25 instances

00:15:11.670 --> 00:15:16.950
Or it could remember 10 whatever you want.

00:15:16.950 --> 00:15:23.180
So it will ensure that it will limit your server configuration also so that you didn't get

00:15:23.180 --> 00:15:24.850
charge unnecessarily.

00:15:24.850 --> 00:15:30.420
Now in the scale group size,

00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.890
I need to name it here and what I want.

00:15:34.890 --> 00:15:42.270
I want some different policies to try to diss option and here you can choose You're

00:15:42.270 --> 00:15:44.980
increased growth size or your decrease group size.

00:15:44.980 --> 00:15:47.280
So,

00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:48.020
like I say,

00:15:48.020 --> 00:15:48.400
Hey,

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:56.900
hear that new server at on?

00:15:56.900 --> 00:15:58.620
And I said one,

00:15:58.620 --> 00:15:59.200
Allow me,

00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:00.170
I want to set one.

00:16:00.170 --> 00:16:00.850
Allow mares.

00:16:00.850 --> 00:16:10.250
I click on air New Alarm and I'll put some notification here like I create new topic.

00:16:10.250 --> 00:16:14.390
So new said What?

00:16:14.390 --> 00:16:15.080
Ed?

00:16:15.080 --> 00:16:29.750
And I'll put my email lady like this and I'll put some configuration here which say's ah,

00:16:29.750 --> 00:16:31.710
what the condition you want.

00:16:31.710 --> 00:16:35.170
Like if my eyes maximum CPU relation goes high,

00:16:35.170 --> 00:16:37.390
approximately from 80%.

00:16:37.390 --> 00:16:45.390
So in my city or relation Rex immensity relation goes 80% equal to or greater than this for

00:16:45.390 --> 00:16:48.780
at least one time for consecutive five minutes.

00:16:48.780 --> 00:16:53.680
So my simulation goes 80% for continuously five minutes,

00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:55.390
at least for one time.

00:16:55.390 --> 00:16:56.180
Or,

00:16:56.180 --> 00:16:56.710
if you want,

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.580
you can change it like to,

00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:04.910
so you want that one allowing short of is created,

00:17:04.910 --> 00:17:07.160
so I'll put it here.

00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:14.700
So now I set upon alarm condition that if my CPU relation off the available servers goes

00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.610
higher than 80% for continuously five minutes,

00:17:17.610 --> 00:17:20.350
it the accent.

00:17:20.350 --> 00:17:22.590
It is in alarming situation,

00:17:22.590 --> 00:17:28.350
and on this I can take connection like Ed or certain does like something this.

00:17:28.350 --> 00:17:39.050
So I see that ad one said what one is stones then my situation goes 80% again.

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:39.730
The one of time.

00:17:39.730 --> 00:17:42.360
I want to give his 302nd by default.

00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.430
Similarly,

00:17:45.430 --> 00:17:47.590
I can set up the crease group size policy.

00:17:47.590 --> 00:17:50.660
Also for this I need toe.

00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:51.790
Give the alarm.

00:17:51.790 --> 00:17:53.850
I need to create another alarm too.

00:17:53.850 --> 00:18:03.460
Here's suppose I want I You won't use this one sort of remove notification and I put my

00:18:03.460 --> 00:18:08.100
email address there and I want that van.

00:18:08.100 --> 00:18:16.200
Mississippi lesson goes minimum toe 30% like this.

00:18:16.200 --> 00:18:18.200
So I said that my sip,

00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:22.850
your relation goes less than 30% for at least five minutes.

00:18:22.850 --> 00:18:26.950
So my servers are stable and if this is the condition,

00:18:26.950 --> 00:18:34.160
I'll put it low to make it more relevant.

00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:37.030
So for me,

00:18:37.030 --> 00:18:41.320
this is a good condition for me that my service are now not overloaded.

00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:46.950
And I'm okay that I can take some action like I can remove on server from this environment

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:46.950
.

00:18:46.950 --> 00:18:54.170
So I see it move one instances when my stipulation is less than 30%.

00:18:54.170 --> 00:19:00.430
So kind of these things I can set up wire auto scaling policies,

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:03.550
and you can check that it is a very healthy future.

00:19:03.550 --> 00:19:04.280
And,

00:19:04.280 --> 00:19:04.790
moreover,

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:08.710
I can set up it with an existing load balancer like I have truth,

00:19:08.710 --> 00:19:10.060
my load balancer there.

00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:13.890
Let's go to next.

00:19:13.890 --> 00:19:17.630
I want to add notifications so you can get that one.

00:19:17.630 --> 00:19:26.990
And here you can do the notification list and you can choose venue won't notifications via

00:19:26.990 --> 00:19:27.490
email.

00:19:27.490 --> 00:19:30.950
So if any and any new server get launched,

00:19:30.950 --> 00:19:34.870
terminate our failed to launch or failed to terminate in your environment,

00:19:34.870 --> 00:19:37.660
you will get notified on your email address.

00:19:37.660 --> 00:19:41.170
Here.

00:19:41.170 --> 00:19:53.430
You can give the important information which you want to put you're or does killing go up

00:19:53.430 --> 00:19:59.430
to 50 tax you can put there and here you can review that things.

00:19:59.430 --> 00:20:01.450
So I found it.

00:20:01.450 --> 00:20:03.650
It is fine for me right now.

00:20:03.650 --> 00:20:04.930
It's a Web Serotta,

00:20:04.930 --> 00:20:05.640
Skilling said.

00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:07.390
Group has been set up.

00:20:07.390 --> 00:20:09.330
It is alluding to everybody.

00:20:09.330 --> 00:20:12.860
Jos Target Group is rips that were targeted in a Web server.

00:20:12.860 --> 00:20:13.940
DJ,

00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.370
which is my load balancer.

00:20:15.370 --> 00:20:23.140
New severeid condition is like everyone starts when several direction Woods for higher than

00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:26.260
80% like this and I said a medical its policy.

00:20:26.260 --> 00:20:30.410
I said of notifications for this emailer does.

00:20:30.410 --> 00:20:32.930
When launched her mission failed to launch a full term.

00:20:32.930 --> 00:20:42.930
It comes under just fine with me and here I am creating the new policies here.

00:20:42.930 --> 00:20:53.950
My auto scaling policies has been set up and you can also revise it from here.

00:20:53.950 --> 00:20:59.880
This is your orders killing group which has been set up now and hear all the information

00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:00.790
you can verify.

00:21:00.790 --> 00:21:04.060
And even if you want to change the configuration,

00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:07.160
you can do it by simply clicking on added option.

00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:12.310
Whatever your activities.

00:21:12.310 --> 00:21:12.540
Three.

00:21:12.540 --> 00:21:17.390
Right now poster was all getting launch because I set up their that their food women even

00:21:17.390 --> 00:21:18.690
to service every label.

00:21:18.690 --> 00:21:21.870
And it is using my e m I,

00:21:21.870 --> 00:21:22.780
sir,

00:21:22.780 --> 00:21:24.100
which I choose.

00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.340
This is my Skilling policies.

00:21:28.340 --> 00:21:29.470
If I want to change it,

00:21:29.470 --> 00:21:30.370
you can do that.

00:21:30.370 --> 00:21:32.820
This is your stances status,

00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:33.480
which is right.

00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.950
No good things ready.

00:21:35.950 --> 00:21:38.160
There are.

00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:48.420
These are two stances which are getting new at it.

00:21:48.420 --> 00:21:56.050
This is your You can monitor also your environment.

00:21:56.050 --> 00:21:56.230
Here.

00:21:56.230 --> 00:21:57.400
You can see that easily.

00:21:57.400 --> 00:22:02.970
You can monitor your environment like weren't harmony number times stances have been

00:22:02.970 --> 00:22:03.790
terminated.

00:22:03.790 --> 00:22:04.860
What is your desire?

00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:08.000
Capacity of what is your current district,

00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:09.220
US all together,

00:22:09.220 --> 00:22:11.260
all information you can verify from here.

00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:13.580
This is like notifications.

00:22:13.580 --> 00:22:14.150
Tax.

00:22:14.150 --> 00:22:16.140
Whatever information you want to set up,

00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:17.790
you can choose it,

00:22:17.790 --> 00:22:19.260
and you can check it well.

00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:22.520
Auto scaling policy in action Also,

00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:24.220
you if you want to delete or edit,

00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:24.970
you can do that.

00:22:24.970 --> 00:22:28.340
Let's see what happens actually in the back.

00:22:28.340 --> 00:22:31.850
And I said that minimum tours senses should be ready.

00:22:31.850 --> 00:22:33.140
It is desired,

00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:38.420
and it can go up to a maximum tank service based on the condition.

00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:44.880
My sippy situation goes hard than 80% and I go to instances.

00:22:44.880 --> 00:22:57.560
So guys here you can see that my to service was earlier already in production.

00:22:57.560 --> 00:23:07.450
And I don't need do service right now because I sat on my auto scaling policy and it

00:23:07.450 --> 00:23:09.250
created my to minimum servers,

00:23:09.250 --> 00:23:10.410
which I required.

00:23:10.410 --> 00:23:11.790
So what I'll do,

00:23:11.790 --> 00:23:14.380
I'll stop these or I'll terminate the settlers,

00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:24.390
and right now you can see that I have to service or to scale,

00:23:24.390 --> 00:23:26.850
which is set up by Auto Scaling Group.

00:23:26.850 --> 00:23:32.780
And this these are coming into picture right now,

00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.250
are not running completely,

00:23:34.250 --> 00:23:35.720
So let's wait for their time,

00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:38.680
and I'll come back to you disinter seconds.

00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:40.760
Okay,

00:23:40.760 --> 00:23:43.350
so you can see here that my to service,

00:23:43.350 --> 00:23:46.650
which was earlier behind the load balancer got terminated.

00:23:46.650 --> 00:23:47.590
I deleted them.

00:23:47.590 --> 00:23:51.490
Now those would have different data on these servers.

00:23:51.490 --> 00:23:53.470
And I only have.

00:23:53.470 --> 00:23:54.960
Do you serve us?

00:23:54.960 --> 00:23:55.710
No.

00:23:55.710 --> 00:24:03.220
Which escalated by my auto scaling policy and which used one server which has only one Web

00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:03.750
server,

00:24:03.750 --> 00:24:05.450
One kind of website data.

00:24:05.450 --> 00:24:06.730
So let's check.

00:24:06.730 --> 00:24:07.540
Is it My lord?

00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:08.740
Balance is still working.

00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:13.320
So I go to Lourdes Bellas and I'll pour this in formation.

00:24:13.320 --> 00:24:14.300
DNS name there.

00:24:14.300 --> 00:24:17.450
I'll copy it on the best It here.

00:24:17.450 --> 00:24:24.530
And you can see that my data or my Webster traffic is coming in.

00:24:24.530 --> 00:24:27.790
Previous lab off load balance.

00:24:27.790 --> 00:24:29.290
Have you already tested that load,

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:29.690
balancer?

00:24:29.690 --> 00:24:33.460
How it works and we distribute the data behind multiple servers.

00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:41.050
And this is the same case here like my to service are being load balancer.

00:24:41.050 --> 00:24:46.050
And that is this getting distributed among these two servers.

00:24:46.050 --> 00:24:50.850
So I hope that you like this lab.

00:24:50.850 --> 00:24:52.810
And if you have any questions,

00:24:52.810 --> 00:24:54.390
please let me know or otherwise.

00:24:54.390 --> 00:24:56.120
Please pursuit for the next section.

00:24:56.120 --> 00:24:56.940
Very.

00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.050
We learned about craft with pretty service.

00:24:59.050 --> 00:25:00.440
So thank you.

00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:01.880
Thank you for watching this video.

00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:07.390
Please share your feedback and comments and do come in sections.

00:25:07.390 --> 00:25:08.160
Thank you.

00:25:08.160 --> 00:25:08.880
Tense case.
