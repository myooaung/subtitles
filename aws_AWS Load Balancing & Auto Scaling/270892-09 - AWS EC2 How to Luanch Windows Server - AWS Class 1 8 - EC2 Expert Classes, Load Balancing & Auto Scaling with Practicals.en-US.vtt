00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.240
hello ways.

00:00:02.240 --> 00:00:07.120
Welcome to decision in this particular session Today we will going to learn how we can

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:07.900
launch window.

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:09.640
So I didn't know.

00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.760
You know that how we condone online X over.

00:00:13.760 --> 00:00:17.560
We have seen one example off 12 server Similarly,

00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.180
you can not others that wants to.

00:00:19.180 --> 00:00:23.540
But Windows server is a bit different because ah,

00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:26.980
roughly service are flavored off line X and moreover,

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.320
the command and,

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:28.750
uh,

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:31.180
way to connect them with women seem.

00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:32.810
But for windows over,

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.150
it will be some differently.

00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:38.140
So let's see how we can pursued for Windows seven.

00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:41.070
It is very simple.

00:00:41.070 --> 00:00:43.130
You first need to log in in tow.

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:46.590
It was console as you do on then.

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:57.030
Here we need to goto issue to service simply go to services and then select you see two in

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:57.860
compute section.

00:00:57.860 --> 00:00:59.650
Once you go there,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.160
you will get a similar kind off screen.

00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:03.810
Now,

00:01:03.810 --> 00:01:04.830
here you need to click.

00:01:04.830 --> 00:01:04.900
Oh,

00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:05.860
not instance.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:07.520
Before launching the stones,

00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:10.090
make sure that you are choosing your nearest reason.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:13.980
So the reason should we definitely nearest easier.

00:01:13.980 --> 00:01:18.870
It will definitely going to help you toe less done latency.

00:01:18.870 --> 00:01:22.830
The nearest reason it was it means that you will get connect,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:24.950
you will be able to connect them faster.

00:01:24.950 --> 00:01:27.290
My nearest region is moving,

00:01:27.290 --> 00:01:30.570
so I will connect it with Muna babies.

00:01:30.570 --> 00:01:33.770
I chose in no medicine and no,

00:01:33.770 --> 00:01:36.720
I'm going to click on no insistence under it.

00:01:36.720 --> 00:01:42.670
Another thing is going important which you need to notice that you will get all off your

00:01:42.670 --> 00:01:49.960
service and easy to do days off this particular needs and only not for the other leaders.

00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:55.880
Deck means that you can't see the other service which are hosted in different other reasons

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:55.880
.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.370
You don't you don't will be able to see that one.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:06.870
So make sure that for other reasons.

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:10.330
If you need to check that either service which are who stood in the region,

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:11.560
you need toe change,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:14.040
the didn't and then you can sue.

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.110
You can see your service if I go to Canada.

00:02:19.110 --> 00:02:20.600
Didn't let's go.

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:23.680
For example here I do the different prison.

00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:29.780
You can see that I not have any Stansell studio.

00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:36.350
So it is showing me blend the Darlington confused and believe because sometimes it happened

00:02:36.350 --> 00:02:37.030
that do you launch.

00:02:37.030 --> 00:02:43.080
I saw one in another reason and he will get charged for that because you didn't notice that

00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:44.810
you have lost That said,

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:49.870
Coming back to Mom ladies.

00:02:49.870 --> 00:02:51.790
And moreover,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:53.670
the stubble women seem.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:03:03.690
Let's click on 19 stones here you need to to your template.

00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:08.720
There are different templates available for Windows flavor like you can use Microsoft

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:10.840
Windows Server 2016 based Murder.

00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:13.730
All the versions are available in 64 Bit.

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:18.990
Moved only on Have you considered to this 2016 data center?

00:03:18.990 --> 00:03:21.580
There are other service.

00:03:21.580 --> 00:03:22.050
Lee.

00:03:22.050 --> 00:03:26.230
You can have 2016 with containers.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:26.790
Docker.

00:03:26.790 --> 00:03:30.220
Then new has 2016.

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.590
You know,

00:03:30.590 --> 00:03:32.970
schools.

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:34.290
Our express traditions.

00:03:34.290 --> 00:03:35.410
If you want a sculpture,

00:03:35.410 --> 00:03:37.410
will expressinstall with the server.

00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:38.280
Already you will.

00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:40.250
You can use this instance.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:42.730
If you want a schools have a revolution,

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:43.120
you can,

00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:43.390
too.

00:03:43.390 --> 00:03:47.390
This template like this there are different.

00:03:47.390 --> 00:03:48.380
If you want escorts,

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:49.380
I was tender tradition.

00:03:49.380 --> 00:03:53.650
You can choose this one like this would have Intel flavors out of service level,

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.100
and you can choose accordingly.

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:56.140
That's very quiet.

00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.480
If you go down,

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:08.560
I think you can check 8 2007 Thank to support the older wiser.

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.710
They also provide 2003.

00:04:10.710 --> 00:04:14.670
So for the example right now,

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:17.590
just make sure that the service which are you,

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:23.720
which you are choosing that must be available in the Frieder and I choose here Very tired,

00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:27.250
invisible server and I choose the best solution.

00:04:27.250 --> 00:04:34.160
I click on select foreigner based Friedel Izabal.

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:35.740
I will choose to to my crew.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:41.090
But you can change the information if you require you can to another different wolf

00:04:41.090 --> 00:04:49.970
configuration Then head I will define the marathon starts is and you don't leave on right

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:50.220
now.

00:04:50.220 --> 00:04:59.570
And the other options I can go with the default by default in windows several.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:08.210
You will get that rtg this so the new partition will be tardy TV And here the three options

00:05:08.210 --> 00:05:10.070
you will form that are good ever.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:15.360
So you can too General purpose probe ism and magnetic as you in order general purposes for

00:05:15.360 --> 00:05:19.630
our dental uses Provisional where the input output transition are high.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.340
You going to prove is an I O Pius are you can too are such a magnetic.

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:29.870
But its input output quality is quite know So we will not support all.

00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:36.250
I will not suggest you to use magnetic stories how where it is cheaper but it is not very

00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:36.710
useful.

00:05:36.710 --> 00:05:39.850
So go for it go for general purpose.

00:05:39.850 --> 00:05:41.290
As for the suggestion,

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:43.550
I'm for their daily normal uses.

00:05:43.550 --> 00:05:45.970
If you want to add another disk,

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:52.530
you can simply er the values on it will be like the route will be or see part teacher.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:57.110
This will be your d and this year will be You don't like this.

00:05:57.110 --> 00:05:58.760
You can add another partitions.

00:05:58.760 --> 00:06:05.080
According I know,

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:11.970
I'm removing this one here.

00:06:11.970 --> 00:06:13.650
The name you need to give.

00:06:13.650 --> 00:06:18.150
I see Name the other information you can also air.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:29.760
Like if you want to air your company name your location and other useful information to

00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:38.920
server that tags are quite healthy sometimes because nice name from a different kind of

00:06:38.920 --> 00:06:39.430
symbols.

00:06:39.430 --> 00:06:41.860
Let's see,

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:45.850
I say you knows Diligent one a little nest.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:52.200
I create a security group for this security for Windows server.

00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:54.370
I need right,

00:06:54.370 --> 00:06:55.650
No Rdp NYT,

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:58.000
years and estudio STM airport.

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:01.310
So I choose STD.

00:07:01.310 --> 00:07:03.840
My source could be any.

00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:07.230
That means I can connect it from any source location.

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.230
If you want to give you a specific location,

00:07:10.230 --> 00:07:14.100
you're going to choose your customer Happy network if you want.

00:07:14.100 --> 00:07:14.910
Anywhere on.

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:16.010
If you choose my feet,

00:07:16.010 --> 00:07:18.850
it will pick your source B.

00:07:18.850 --> 00:07:24.040
But normally we are using laptops with data card connectivity,

00:07:24.040 --> 00:07:25.620
dongle office,

00:07:25.620 --> 00:07:28.930
some WiFi and these eyepieces are normally used to get change.

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:32.330
So I'm not suggest you to use my I p.

00:07:32.330 --> 00:07:34.400
But if you have permanent static,

00:07:34.400 --> 00:07:34.720
I peed.

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.540
Then definitely.

00:07:35.540 --> 00:07:36.380
You can go with this,

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:36.990
my dear.

00:07:36.990 --> 00:07:44.580
This gift will choose anywhere.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:53.960
Then this girl and go toe with these details and review the options we can launch.

00:07:53.960 --> 00:07:57.750
And here I can use the existing keys.

00:07:57.750 --> 00:07:59.880
I have this one,

00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.270
my foster one Tookie,

00:08:01.270 --> 00:08:03.520
which we created in previous sessions.

00:08:03.520 --> 00:08:13.300
And I'll use the same if you want you conclude a different key for window servers and it is

00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:18.060
good practice like you can created your different keys I lost.

00:08:18.060 --> 00:08:22.250
Or just that you need to get every key for every single server.

00:08:22.250 --> 00:08:24.130
But definitely you can,

00:08:24.130 --> 00:08:24.750
you know,

00:08:24.750 --> 00:08:27.290
make them into groups like you can change.

00:08:27.290 --> 00:08:30.530
You can have a lefty for your Web servers.

00:08:30.530 --> 00:08:34.440
You can have windows key for your window so you can have your land.

00:08:34.440 --> 00:08:37.490
Excuse your Nextera scoop is really managed them,

00:08:37.490 --> 00:08:43.820
but you don't need to definitely launch a separate Keep here for each fight.

00:08:43.820 --> 00:08:47.610
It several got it will be difficult to manage.

00:08:47.610 --> 00:08:52.560
If you have a large number off sandals here,

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:55.880
you can see that my server is getting ready because it is a Windows server.

00:08:55.880 --> 00:08:56.440
It was.

00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:57.270
Take some time.

00:08:57.270 --> 00:08:58.580
Approximately five minutes.

00:08:58.580 --> 00:08:59.850
5 to 10 minutes time.

00:08:59.850 --> 00:09:01.040
Uh,

00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:03.000
it could with the flathead.

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:03.940
You can see you have window.

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:06.740
Someone name on it will take something.

00:09:06.740 --> 00:09:09.060
So I'll take a pause here,

00:09:09.060 --> 00:09:11.660
and I will come back once.

00:09:11.660 --> 00:09:12.360
That's elegant,

00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:12.510
right?

00:09:12.510 --> 00:09:13.260
Thank you.

00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:16.300
Okay.

00:09:16.300 --> 00:09:16.810
So luckily,

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:18.470
it didn't take much time.

00:09:18.470 --> 00:09:21.260
Approximately three minutes more on.

00:09:21.260 --> 00:09:22.560
I'm ready to go now.

00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.600
So here you need toe again.

00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:27.250
The public eye.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:27.950
Petrus?

00:09:27.950 --> 00:09:29.590
Yes.

00:09:29.590 --> 00:09:30.810
Connected.

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:33.440
There are my devil options to connective induced.

00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:34.320
What you can do,

00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.290
you can download more.

00:09:35.290 --> 00:09:35.670
Next off.

00:09:35.670 --> 00:09:38.700
Fight on it was simply download one file for you.

00:09:38.700 --> 00:09:43.710
One thing you need to notice that because if you are choosing your public,

00:09:43.710 --> 00:09:44.450
I appear to us.

00:09:44.450 --> 00:09:45.120
This,

00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:45.510
I fear,

00:09:45.510 --> 00:09:47.940
doesn't get jeans normally recently,

00:09:47.940 --> 00:09:49.160
normally time.

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:49.580
Good time.

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:55.840
So if you have downloaded this fight might be this will not work off the one or two days

00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:56.760
because I peered.

00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:02.530
This will get changed and you need toe again down the road If you want to make it permanent

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:02.530
.

00:10:02.530 --> 00:10:04.750
There is a term called elastic I p address,

00:10:04.750 --> 00:10:11.570
which is which works similarly as a static I p address on you get You need to use that one

00:10:11.570 --> 00:10:18.330
eso in front of section we or in further we will see that how we can assign elastic idea

00:10:18.330 --> 00:10:30.620
just And to get the password for this you need to click again that password nickel access

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:34.150
You need to give her the PM file which you have downloaded first time.

00:10:34.150 --> 00:10:38.550
Help me pick a file is not a card opinion file only is enough.

00:10:38.550 --> 00:10:42.050
And once you don't know that you need to decrypt this one.

00:10:42.050 --> 00:10:51.070
And here you get the password to connect it simply enough file which you have downloaded.

00:10:51.070 --> 00:10:52.170
You can use this one.

00:10:52.170 --> 00:11:01.940
It will by to connect this one and it will give you your users another way you can If you

00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:03.190
are using a windows machine,

00:11:03.190 --> 00:11:08.850
you can directly use a musty A C common removed that stopped tool and you can give your i p

00:11:08.850 --> 00:11:09.370
address.

00:11:09.370 --> 00:11:25.080
But you give your I peered waas it will try to connect this one And here you can see you

00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:31.290
need to give your user name and the password which you have you any matter you can choose,

00:11:31.290 --> 00:11:38.350
not try to connect with you and had me good to go.

00:11:38.350 --> 00:11:44.830
Now I'm getting logging into my window several,

00:11:44.830 --> 00:11:46.480
which I have just recently nosed.

00:11:46.480 --> 00:12:00.560
And here you can check the duties like on the subway,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.600
which I want to talk about Micro which have one to be them.

00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:06.540
And one GB memorial and Bill,

00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:07.850
once a few.

00:12:07.850 --> 00:12:10.370
Let's see what did shoes here.

00:12:10.370 --> 00:12:12.560
And it has started to be hard x two.

00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:21.560
So here you can see you can verify it is student Michael and stance.

00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:23.120
It's private eye Pierre,

00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:24.910
this is there and the public eye peered us,

00:12:24.910 --> 00:12:25.470
which is given.

00:12:25.470 --> 00:12:28.890
They're already it starts memory is one GB s.

00:12:28.890 --> 00:12:31.280
Percy and it it is using Mt.

00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:31.850
Pleasant.

00:12:31.850 --> 00:12:35.450
The same can be very faithful here.

00:12:35.450 --> 00:12:46.870
If you check the properties,

00:12:46.870 --> 00:12:49.330
you can verify that it has one GB money.

00:12:49.330 --> 00:12:52.150
This differ but architecture Professor.

00:12:52.150 --> 00:12:54.240
On this way,

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:55.550
this is a process of detail.

00:12:55.550 --> 00:13:00.480
And if you go to the hardest point,

00:13:00.480 --> 00:13:09.110
you can see here that it has started you behind this s sister so base Ah,

00:13:09.110 --> 00:13:12.180
one more thing like if you are connecting it into public.

00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:14.030
If you're launching it into public domain,

00:13:14.030 --> 00:13:16.250
you will also get the Internet access.

00:13:16.250 --> 00:13:23.340
So here you can see if I try to run and you website on this,

00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:25.590
I should be able to do this.

00:13:25.590 --> 00:13:42.900

You can see that I want to open my left eye.

00:13:46.940 --> 00:13:50.890
Okay,

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:53.590
so I hope this session remain useful for you.

00:13:53.590 --> 00:13:55.360
Another important thing.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.020
We can notice that we can assign an elastic i p address to this.

00:13:59.020 --> 00:14:00.560
So to assign an elastic,

00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:09.250
I appear that you just need to give goto elastic eye protection in easy to locate a new

00:14:09.250 --> 00:14:09.780
address,

00:14:09.780 --> 00:14:14.850

That's the secret and 20 stars with which starts with Do you want to associate it as acidic

00:14:33.350 --> 00:14:38.850
and you don't If you go to your stars his hair,

00:14:38.850 --> 00:14:40.790
you will see,

00:14:40.790 --> 00:14:49.710
when I paired us in blue color here you can see the elastic I purpose and public I paired

00:14:49.710 --> 00:14:52.990
us also got changed with this blue color right here Does type here this same.

00:14:52.990 --> 00:14:58.970
And now this Ipad This will not going to change until and unless you change it mentally,

00:14:58.970 --> 00:15:01.140
you want to remain,

00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:01.560
is it?

00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:05.980
You need to disassociate it so you can click on disassociate.

00:15:05.980 --> 00:15:08.200
This is to see it.

00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:11.090

this will be charged him.

00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:24.380
But if you are associated with the associated with any server,

00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:26.000
this is not a chargeable.

00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:26.960
And for diesels,

00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:29.900
you want to release it.

00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:35.470
The goodness this point for long.
