00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.245
Okay, So in this video we'll learn about how you can launch a credit server,

00:00:07.245 --> 00:00:09.599
which is very popular in companies,

00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:14.790
and most of the companies use or edits or right?

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.615
So first you need to login into services.

00:00:18.615 --> 00:00:20.070
Then is you two.

00:00:20.070 --> 00:00:23.625
You will get this kind of console, okay?

00:00:23.625 --> 00:00:27.825
Then go to instances. Okay?

00:00:27.825 --> 00:00:29.590
Click on.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.140
Okay. Then because it is a free direct counts,

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.960
so I will choose here T2 micro,

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:42.310
but you can choose any.

00:00:42.310 --> 00:00:45.229
And he says read as per your requirements.

00:00:45.229 --> 00:00:47.780
So there are a lot of different configuration with

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.440
different CPU and memory process are available.

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:53.000
And you can choose that one.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:55.940
But because this is for training and it was empty

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:59.360
to dot micro which is available under free that okay.

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.025
I'm clicking on Next.

00:01:01.025 --> 00:01:05.015
Then how many server you want to launch you can do that one.

00:01:05.015 --> 00:01:07.160
This is by default VPC,

00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:11.930
which we are using because AWS needs some network, right?

00:01:11.930 --> 00:01:14.090
Or every 78, some default network,

00:01:14.090 --> 00:01:15.140
at least one network.

00:01:15.140 --> 00:01:18.200
So we are using AWS default network.

00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:23.855
There are six datacenters available in AWS.

00:01:23.855 --> 00:01:26.900
So I'm using anyone, right?

00:01:26.900 --> 00:01:32.075
And you can use anyone and your server when we launch into that particular datacenter.

00:01:32.075 --> 00:01:35.735
So this is actually we talk when we are talking about subnet.

00:01:35.735 --> 00:01:40.789
So here in default subnet availability zone is equal to Datacenter

00:01:40.789 --> 00:01:45.680
you can consider and you're going to lose any.

00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:48.800
So for me, I'll go forth 18.

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.940
Okay.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:52.760
Then we need public IP address by default,

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.220
it is enabled if you do a default network

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:01.340
because we need this public IP address to connect it from internet.

00:02:01.340 --> 00:02:05.630
Okay? So i2, this enabled.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:07.130
Then the other things

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:14.210
are not required or we can go with the by default behavior for the shut down,

00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:15.725
it should go for a stop.

00:02:15.725 --> 00:02:17.945
If you want to enable high VNET,

00:02:17.945 --> 00:02:20.045
you have to take this option.

00:02:20.045 --> 00:02:29.360
Okay? Then we can

00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:33.710
go with the default options here and I click on Next.

00:02:33.710 --> 00:02:40.175
Then you can add your hard disk or you can say a disk to your server.

00:02:40.175 --> 00:02:45.520
And you can too, like how much desk you want to add.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:47.470
So suppose if you want to add multibody,

00:02:47.470 --> 00:02:50.680
it comes by default 110 dB disk, okay?

00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:52.510
But if you want to add more desk,

00:02:52.510 --> 00:02:56.965
you're going to click on add new volume and you can add the additional variable in here.

00:02:56.965 --> 00:03:01.705
I will get one more 15 GB disk. Okay?

00:03:01.705 --> 00:03:05.230
And and what else?

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:09.505
I think rest part is optional.

00:03:09.505 --> 00:03:12.265
But you're going to add new volumes anytime if you want.

00:03:12.265 --> 00:03:13.330
Okay?

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.690
Then tag is very important,

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.680
like you can add very important conventions like to read it.

00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:26.985
So I save my first letter server.

00:03:26.985 --> 00:03:37.170
Then I can add that tag information like on a pressure on our Cloud learning.

00:03:37.510 --> 00:03:47.929
Then you can add technical contact like the shan't.

00:03:47.929 --> 00:03:51.710
Okay? So I'm using this one, so I'll do that.

00:03:51.710 --> 00:03:57.605
And another important thing is that while keeping this, these texts,

00:03:57.605 --> 00:03:59.330
while launching those are what these texts will

00:03:59.330 --> 00:04:01.730
automatically get attached to your instances,

00:04:01.730 --> 00:04:04.715
your volumes, and your network interfaces, okay?

00:04:04.715 --> 00:04:08.480
We want to remove that you can, okay?

00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.475
And additional information also you can write.

00:04:13.475 --> 00:04:17.390
So tag is quite important most of the times.

00:04:17.390 --> 00:04:21.275
One very important use I seen if you use backup,

00:04:21.275 --> 00:04:23.630
right, if you need to do backup,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:26.180
so you can take backup on.

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:30.740
You're going to create a e with the name of backup, okay.

00:04:30.740 --> 00:04:33.755
You can add a tag and you can put its value yes or no.

00:04:33.755 --> 00:04:37.850
And you can set a rule like for the backup tags.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:39.650
Mecca will be done, right?

00:04:39.650 --> 00:04:41.330
Automatic backup will happen.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:43.310
And if its value is no,

00:04:43.310 --> 00:04:44.810
it will not happen like this.

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.210
You can add, okay?

00:04:47.210 --> 00:04:51.995
Or you can manage your backup policy according to this.

00:04:51.995 --> 00:04:53.660
So tags are quite important.

00:04:53.660 --> 00:04:59.030
It is simple thing, but it is very important and very useful this, okay guys.

00:04:59.030 --> 00:05:03.320
I will be describing our tax now, the security group.

00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:04.835
So what is security group?

00:05:04.835 --> 00:05:05.690
Okay.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:09.770
So security group is something like I have blocked everything, right?

00:05:09.770 --> 00:05:12.830
Nobody can connect to my server by default.

00:05:12.830 --> 00:05:16.385
So it is kind of a firewall for your system, right?

00:05:16.385 --> 00:05:20.825
And and it's kind of a firewall for your system.

00:05:20.825 --> 00:05:24.920
And what I can say that every port,

00:05:24.920 --> 00:05:28.070
incoming port is by default block, okay,

00:05:28.070 --> 00:05:33.440
insecurity with so like I can.

00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:38.000
Give it some name like red or security group. Okay.

00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.110
And same host, Liskov Shun.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:46.640
And photo is SSH like this.

00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:50.840
Okay? So SSH is required to connect your server.

00:05:50.840 --> 00:05:54.500
So that's why I need at least need to open this port.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:57.350
And here its port number is 22,

00:05:57.350 --> 00:05:59.240
so I don't need to change it.

00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:02.810
And I can choose here from which source you want to connect.

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.640
So if you do have any particular range,

00:06:04.640 --> 00:06:08.270
you can specify your office network or something like this,

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:14.180
or your home network if you are not sure and do you want

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:17.270
like anybody can connect or if it is like

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:20.555
for me it is a test machines though I can connect it from anywhere.

00:06:20.555 --> 00:06:21.770
So I'll choose anywhere.

00:06:21.770 --> 00:06:23.870
And geodata 0, dot-dot, dot-dot, dot-dot,

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:30.335
dot-dot slash 0 means that from any IP it can be connected.

00:06:30.335 --> 00:06:33.350
So similarly, I can add them.

00:06:33.350 --> 00:06:35.660
More popular ports are available here,

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.150
like my S squared, NFS,

00:06:38.150 --> 00:06:43.129
samba, IMAP, all such available bootleg STDP.

00:06:43.129 --> 00:06:48.335
Stdp has all available pores you can easily add if you want to allow them.

00:06:48.335 --> 00:06:51.545
Otherwise, suppose you are hosting a website on your server.

00:06:51.545 --> 00:06:55.325
Molecule haven't opened the STDP port insecurity group.

00:06:55.325 --> 00:06:58.400
So what will happen that it block your traffic, right?

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.955
What will happen? Let me clarify here.

00:07:01.955 --> 00:07:05.825
Okay, suppose you have a website running on your server.

00:07:05.825 --> 00:07:06.740
Okay?

00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:09.030
This is your server.

00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:14.390
And one website is running on port 80.

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:20.465
Ok. web server, website running on port 30.

00:07:20.465 --> 00:07:24.860
Okay? Find out this which we launch.

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:30.545
Okay? But this has one security group open here, right?

00:07:30.545 --> 00:07:31.880
Sorry.

00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:34.560
So this is your security group.

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:49.220
Okay? So this is your security group.

00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.375
And if you note allowed AT vote open here, what did we do?

00:07:53.375 --> 00:07:55.979
If it is not allowed?

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:01.175
It will block your server x's, right.

00:08:01.175 --> 00:08:06.140
So disport, should we allow that only the end-users like you and

00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:11.390
me can connect to this website, okay?

00:08:11.390 --> 00:08:15.485
User one, user two.

00:08:15.485 --> 00:08:16.310
Okay?

00:08:16.310 --> 00:08:19.080
So if you need to connect them,

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:22.460
if you need to connect them,

00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:24.110
you need to go at this,

00:08:24.110 --> 00:08:26.135
we need to connect them.

00:08:26.135 --> 00:08:28.325
You need to go via this, right?

00:08:28.325 --> 00:08:31.085
And this means that this port should be open.

00:08:31.085 --> 00:08:33.560
If it is not a one, it should not walk.

00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:38.180
That is the reason why we allow a vote here, okay?

00:08:38.180 --> 00:08:40.175
For website, right?

00:08:40.175 --> 00:08:42.425
And SSH port.

00:08:42.425 --> 00:08:46.085
Similarly, like SSH port is running here, okay?

00:08:46.085 --> 00:08:48.875
So I can connect,

00:08:48.875 --> 00:08:51.695
As it says, 22 is open,

00:08:51.695 --> 00:08:54.630
but if it is not allowed here,

00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:59.165
it is not allowed here. Okay?

00:08:59.165 --> 00:09:01.265
So you can't connect.

00:09:01.265 --> 00:09:03.455
So this port should we open?

00:09:03.455 --> 00:09:06.215
This board should be open, okay?

00:09:06.215 --> 00:09:08.015
But this is how it should work.

00:09:08.015 --> 00:09:09.365
Okay?

00:09:09.365 --> 00:09:11.900
So I allow SSH Fortier.

00:09:11.900 --> 00:09:14.705
I want right now only SSH for so that is fine.

00:09:14.705 --> 00:09:21.950
And maybe on the latest days I would required website as well.

00:09:21.950 --> 00:09:25.115
So what I'll do, I'll open STDEV boat as well.

00:09:25.115 --> 00:09:33.930
Okay. And anybody can open my website so I am using the boat review.

00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:37.820
So you're going to view your screen like I am using tutorial micro.

00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.130
If you want to change, you can change it from here.

00:09:40.130 --> 00:09:43.550
Then you can check your security groups right now as a such,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:45.260
a native boot is allowed.

00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.155
And if you want to change your security group,

00:09:48.155 --> 00:09:49.925
you can do it from here.

00:09:49.925 --> 00:09:53.150
Then you can check all you and standard envoy is.

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.630
So right now it is On-Demand instance, okay?

00:09:56.630 --> 00:09:58.895
We will talk about the instances,

00:09:58.895 --> 00:10:02.375
different type of instance, pricing model, liter.

00:10:02.375 --> 00:10:04.625
Then you can go to stories.

00:10:04.625 --> 00:10:09.575
And so I have to do scared 10 GB and 15 JV.

00:10:09.575 --> 00:10:13.940
Then I can show my text has been okay,

00:10:13.940 --> 00:10:15.155
So I'm good with it.

00:10:15.155 --> 00:10:20.855
So what I can do that I can create a new key pair.

00:10:20.855 --> 00:10:21.515
Okay?

00:10:21.515 --> 00:10:25.100
So what is key here? Now the another terms come with what is keep it.

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:27.020
Okay, so we will talk about this.

00:10:27.020 --> 00:10:29.240
What, yeah, what is key pair TPID,

00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:30.860
something like a password.

00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.650
It is the skier is having password for you,

00:10:33.650 --> 00:10:36.845
so this file will have the password for you.

00:10:36.845 --> 00:10:37.745
Okay?

00:10:37.745 --> 00:10:40.010
So I need to, this,

00:10:40.010 --> 00:10:41.930
is this an additional security layer,

00:10:41.930 --> 00:10:43.235
or you can say,

00:10:43.235 --> 00:10:44.750
apart from security group,

00:10:44.750 --> 00:10:46.520
this is another security layer.

00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:53.910
And you can create a

00:10:56.890 --> 00:10:59.345
And you can download this.

00:10:59.345 --> 00:11:03.905
So this file will have your password information in encrypted mode, okay?

00:11:03.905 --> 00:11:05.465
In encrypted mode.

00:11:05.465 --> 00:11:07.985
So you can use it anytime.

00:11:07.985 --> 00:11:11.610
Okay? Then I can launch my instance.

00:11:12.490 --> 00:11:15.590
So myself, I will get ready.

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:18.095
So this is my fossa radius server.

00:11:18.095 --> 00:11:23.300
Okay. I will show you another two service like Amazon,

00:11:23.300 --> 00:11:27.300
Linux and Mac and Windows as well.

00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:35.450
So here guys, if you see my server got ready now and I can connect this, okay?

00:11:35.450 --> 00:11:37.520
So there are a couple of options.

00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:38.645
I can connect this.

00:11:38.645 --> 00:11:40.865
I can connect it via what you do.

00:11:40.865 --> 00:11:43.160
If you are using a Windows system.

00:11:43.160 --> 00:11:48.245
If I can answer, use SSH tool.

00:11:48.245 --> 00:11:51.125
And I can also do it connect pen.

00:11:51.125 --> 00:11:53.360
I can kinda got so it via browser.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:12:00.560
So I show you my connecting it over browser. If it allows.

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:03.770
Sometimes it can give you issue.

00:12:03.770 --> 00:12:06.245
If your browser don't support it.

00:12:06.245 --> 00:12:08.225
So like if you see right now,

00:12:08.225 --> 00:12:09.710
I'm not able to connect it.

00:12:09.710 --> 00:12:12.905
Okay? So what I'll do here,

00:12:12.905 --> 00:12:17.720
let me just try to connect the server via what do you do?

00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:19.670
Okay, So i in the next video,

00:12:19.670 --> 00:12:20.870
I will give you the order.

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.500
That is how you can download and how you can connect it.

00:12:24.500 --> 00:12:31.550
But right now, we can see that mice have about ready, okay?

00:12:31.550 --> 00:12:35.180
And we can try to connect it via E2.

00:12:35.180 --> 00:12:36.455
Okay?

00:12:36.455 --> 00:12:40.400
Okay. So basically we need a couple of tools.

00:12:40.400 --> 00:12:44.210
One is pretty, I will create a separate video.

00:12:44.210 --> 00:12:49.295
So you can refer the separate videos which I created for showing how you can use them.

00:12:49.295 --> 00:12:52.595
But one is put D to lie required.

00:12:52.595 --> 00:12:57.410
Another tool I required put Jan. if you are using a Windows machine, right?

00:12:57.410 --> 00:13:00.140
Why I need this PuTTYgen tool, put it into,

00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:04.790
is required to convert our BAMfile to

00:13:04.790 --> 00:13:10.115
PB gay because BAMfile is not understand by putting two.

00:13:10.115 --> 00:13:12.395
Okay, so what else do?

00:13:12.395 --> 00:13:15.005
I have downloaded one file here, right?

00:13:15.005 --> 00:13:17.270
And I click on All Files.

00:13:17.270 --> 00:13:19.910
You can see I got my pen fine.

00:13:19.910 --> 00:13:21.830
I need to convert into PPG.

00:13:21.830 --> 00:13:24.770
Okay? So just understand that this is a process.

00:13:24.770 --> 00:13:30.350
So I save it as a private key and then a again give them name,

00:13:30.350 --> 00:13:32.120
the same name I need to give.

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.940
But this time I just need to remove my extension,

00:13:34.940 --> 00:13:36.710
okay, and I can save it.

00:13:36.710 --> 00:13:39.950
So what will happen if I say my private key?

00:13:39.950 --> 00:13:42.335
It will convert it into PPG file.

00:13:42.335 --> 00:13:45.320
Okay, so if you go and download folder,

00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.320
now you can see I have one P,

00:13:48.320 --> 00:13:50.510
pk file as well. Okay?

00:13:50.510 --> 00:13:52.220
Now why I need this?

00:13:52.220 --> 00:13:57.950
Because putty can understand only pb Guifei,

00:13:57.950 --> 00:14:02.130
so I copy my public IP or does go to put D again,

00:14:03.370 --> 00:14:07.605
put the IP address, then go to SSH.

00:14:07.605 --> 00:14:11.720
Polygon Authentication tab click on Browse.

00:14:12.630 --> 00:14:16.135
Then I open my file, open it.

00:14:16.135 --> 00:14:18.010
And what this file?

00:14:18.010 --> 00:14:24.470
It has the password. Okay. It has the password.

00:14:24.540 --> 00:14:28.990
Then by default, username of red eyed machine is easier to use it.

00:14:28.990 --> 00:14:30.235
Okay?

00:14:30.235 --> 00:14:31.870
So if you see,

00:14:31.870 --> 00:14:33.520
I'm able to log in now.

00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:37.270
So this is one way and very popular way to work.

00:14:37.270 --> 00:14:40.750
Okay? Okay, so this way you can see that

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:45.850
I am able to connect and I can run all the commands,

00:14:45.850 --> 00:14:54.320
write whatever I want. Perfect.

00:14:54.320 --> 00:15:02.870
So that's it for this video,

00:15:02.870 --> 00:15:07.415
and that's it for this video.

00:15:07.415 --> 00:15:11.690
And in this video we understood how we can launch a rider server.

00:15:11.690 --> 00:15:15.800
And you can check and you can control many things like you're going to start, stop.

00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.970
You can do all sorts of things by over the console only, right?

00:15:19.970 --> 00:15:21.365
You can check.

00:15:21.365 --> 00:15:24.740
You're going to stop your sorrow or you can start your server,

00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.790
you can reboot, or you can terminate.

00:15:28.790 --> 00:15:32.090
Terminated means the stoic yourselves, right?

00:15:32.090 --> 00:15:34.595
And the other action related things, right?

00:15:34.595 --> 00:15:37.805
So you can do, you can make completely manage it.

00:15:37.805 --> 00:15:39.530
And that it is if you go,

00:15:39.530 --> 00:15:41.630
if you select this server in the blue section,

00:15:41.630 --> 00:15:43.535
you can check all the details.

00:15:43.535 --> 00:15:46.475
Now the console also has been a change a bit.

00:15:46.475 --> 00:15:50.270
So now it is like details.

00:15:50.270 --> 00:15:54.260
You can get all those are what it is like Dan stance side instance ID,

00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.225
a unique ID for every server,

00:15:56.225 --> 00:15:59.120
then its public IP, it's private IP.

00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:02.045
It's status, what the VPC it is using.

00:16:02.045 --> 00:16:05.015
All I did is I will label right?

00:16:05.015 --> 00:16:06.920
What kind of platform it is.

00:16:06.920 --> 00:16:08.690
It is a Linux server, right?

00:16:08.690 --> 00:16:12.410
And then what is the launch time?

00:16:12.410 --> 00:16:14.345
What is the KPI reduce?

00:16:14.345 --> 00:16:18.320
Then? Now they also segregated the different system like security.

00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.720
They are covering IAM role and they are covering security group two days,

00:16:23.720 --> 00:16:25.490
right, which you are using.

00:16:25.490 --> 00:16:28.760
Then in the networking they are giving the VPC information,

00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.880
what do we see they are using and what network

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.945
interfaces and if you are using any elastic IP address, okay?

00:16:35.945 --> 00:16:38.705
Similarly, you can go to stories and the stories,

00:16:38.705 --> 00:16:41.570
the image show you what are the database,

00:16:41.570 --> 00:16:44.270
what are the hard disk for test two servers right now it is

00:16:44.270 --> 00:16:48.185
too hard disk raid 1 is 10 and 1 is 15 GB.

00:16:48.185 --> 00:16:51.320
And if I run the command LSB ALK,

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:53.510
I can see that, right?

00:16:53.510 --> 00:16:55.070
So one is here,

00:16:55.070 --> 00:16:59.165
you can see one is 10 gig and now there's 15.

00:16:59.165 --> 00:17:02.160
Okay. Bu devices they have.

00:17:02.830 --> 00:17:06.185
Then status check.

00:17:06.185 --> 00:17:08.840
You can verify the status of your Savoir,

00:17:08.840 --> 00:17:10.715
these two so the sword week.

00:17:10.715 --> 00:17:11.735
Okay.

00:17:11.735 --> 00:17:14.165
All right. Then monitor.

00:17:14.165 --> 00:17:18.050
So you can check in the monitoring like what other details like how

00:17:18.050 --> 00:17:21.290
your server is performing from our last one,

00:17:21.290 --> 00:17:23.300
our last three hours, 12 hours,

00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:25.805
1D 2D is like this.

00:17:25.805 --> 00:17:26.885
Okay? So this is,

00:17:26.885 --> 00:17:29.570
this will be applicable for all of us are aware as well.

00:17:29.570 --> 00:17:33.290
So these things will be really good for other servers.

00:17:33.290 --> 00:17:34.715
So in the next videos,

00:17:34.715 --> 00:17:39.920
I will show you like how if you need more detail out to connect to your,

00:17:39.920 --> 00:17:41.795
how you can connect via SSH.

00:17:41.795 --> 00:17:44.090
I will show you the connectivity options,

00:17:44.090 --> 00:17:46.850
as well as I will show you how you can use

00:17:46.850 --> 00:17:50.405
Windows Server or how you can use how you can launch Amazon Linux.

00:17:50.405 --> 00:17:52.775
However, the stack will be same.

00:17:52.775 --> 00:17:58.080
We just need to select the template, okay?

00:18:03.370 --> 00:18:06.545
Okay guys, so that's it for this video.

00:18:06.545 --> 00:18:11.630
And if you have any question you can ask me in the Q&A section or in comment section,

00:18:11.630 --> 00:18:17.130
or if not, we can move to the next video. Thank you. Bye bye.
