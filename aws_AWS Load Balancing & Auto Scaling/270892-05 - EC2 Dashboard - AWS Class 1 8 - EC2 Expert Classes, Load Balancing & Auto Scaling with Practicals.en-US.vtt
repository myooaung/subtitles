00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:02.760
Okay guys, so first thing first,

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:04.409
let's talk about EC2.

00:00:04.409 --> 00:00:07.110
And when you will login into EC2,

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.795
ec2 is a very important service, right?

00:00:09.795 --> 00:00:11.040
In cloud computing.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.660
You will already know, right?

00:00:12.660 --> 00:00:15.645
It is, it talks about all the servers, right?

00:00:15.645 --> 00:00:18.150
You, you can have Windows Server,

00:00:18.150 --> 00:00:19.650
you can have Linux server,

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:22.920
which and now they are also supporting Mac system.

00:00:22.920 --> 00:00:23.520
Okay?

00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:30.885
So you can create all of such your service in AWS, right?

00:00:30.885 --> 00:00:35.499
So EC2 Elastic Cloud Compute,

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:40.850
EC2 Elastic Cloud Compute.

00:00:40.850 --> 00:00:42.665
So what I will do in this section,

00:00:42.665 --> 00:00:46.250
I will also give you that knows about all the services.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.640
Okay.

00:00:50.020 --> 00:00:54.020
So I will give you

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:57.515
the handwritten notes so that you can understand East things very easily.

00:00:57.515 --> 00:01:02.104
Okay, So EC2 instance,

00:01:02.104 --> 00:01:04.940
and it covers windows,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.165
it covers Linux systems, right?

00:01:08.165 --> 00:01:10.130
Or almost all flavors.

00:01:10.130 --> 00:01:12.140
And now it is avoiding maps islam also.

00:01:12.140 --> 00:01:12.905
Okay?

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:17.120
So this is, and its full form

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:25.380
is Elastic Cloud Compute.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.715
Okay.

00:01:28.715 --> 00:01:33.320
When you login into your AWS Console,

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.790
you can go to services,

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.170
then compute an EC2.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:37.910
You will get this kind of screen.

00:01:37.910 --> 00:01:39.995
Okay? So on that top,

00:01:39.995 --> 00:01:42.275
the first thing is easy to dashboard.

00:01:42.275 --> 00:01:43.220
Okay?

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:46.250
You see this is the first thing, EC2 dashboard.

00:01:46.250 --> 00:01:47.540
So what I will do here,

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.520
I will suggesting you like what,

00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:51.905
why it is useful light.

00:01:51.905 --> 00:01:55.910
So we already talk about what are the regions, right?

00:01:55.910 --> 00:02:00.365
So it will give you the reason idea and what is the EC2 status?

00:02:00.365 --> 00:02:02.165
What are your reasons, right?

00:02:02.165 --> 00:02:04.085
So if you see here right now,

00:02:04.085 --> 00:02:05.690
I have genome stances learning.

00:02:05.690 --> 00:02:07.115
So if I open this,

00:02:07.115 --> 00:02:11.465
I will confirm the US in right now I'm not using any elastic IP address.

00:02:11.465 --> 00:02:14.105
There are two key pairs which I'm using right now.

00:02:14.105 --> 00:02:14.870
Okay?

00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:18.740
So it gives you complete whole soul idea so that I can check what is

00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:23.255
the actual status of my issue to right.

00:02:23.255 --> 00:02:25.340
Then there is no placement of rural.

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:27.125
There is no a snapshot available.

00:02:27.125 --> 00:02:29.705
Okay. If you are getting the new things,

00:02:29.705 --> 00:02:30.920
don't worry about that.

00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.070
We think we will discuss about all the things in detail.

00:02:34.070 --> 00:02:36.620
But what I'm going to say,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.980
what this dashboard is giving you, right?

00:02:39.980 --> 00:02:42.455
Then it's not only about this.

00:02:42.455 --> 00:02:45.845
If you go down, you can launch a stance.

00:02:45.845 --> 00:02:49.730
You're going to see what if there is any event should do linear reason.

00:02:49.730 --> 00:02:53.885
So there's no Should you live on right now.

00:02:53.885 --> 00:03:01.175
You can use that tools like Cloud migration to simplify.

00:03:01.175 --> 00:03:03.530
And if you want to migrate a machine,

00:03:03.530 --> 00:03:07.940
so this is just suggesting like AWS's is like what you can do, okay?

00:03:07.940 --> 00:03:11.635
So what other services you can try?

00:03:11.635 --> 00:03:14.105
So this is also giving you that idea.

00:03:14.105 --> 00:03:18.590
Then it will give you the your Jonas status, right?

00:03:18.590 --> 00:03:21.555
What is don't these are your Jews, right?

00:03:21.555 --> 00:03:23.150
You talk about like there are

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:26.420
six availability Jones right now available in North Virginia reason.

00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:29.690
So you can see that how is their performance?

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:33.245
Dashboard is giving you accompany the status, right?

00:03:33.245 --> 00:03:35.945
And then if you want to see more,

00:03:35.945 --> 00:03:38.555
you can go to service at dashboard.

00:03:38.555 --> 00:03:44.390
You can have a look on overall services of AWS, okay?

00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:46.070
Like this.

00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:51.950
Okay, So all the things are right now working perfectly fine in AWS, so that is fine.

00:03:51.950 --> 00:03:58.610
So this is now I hope you got some idea of what is a dashboard and why it is useful.

00:03:58.610 --> 00:04:03.210
In the next video, we will see how to launch the instances.
