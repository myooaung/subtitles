00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.910
Okay,

00:00:01.910 --> 00:00:02.370
guys,

00:00:02.370 --> 00:00:03.900
welcome to the secession.

00:00:03.900 --> 00:00:05.000
In this particular session,

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.640
we will learn about all the particular towns which we know and which we used to come in.

00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:15.150
So let's start with left side.

00:00:15.150 --> 00:00:22.140
And if we see you will found one security groups which we normally used to fees.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:26.950
Security works basically as a fire one in New York for your easy.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:33.450
So if you want to put a firewall behind yourself or in front of yours,

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.020
or you can usually use the secret by default with each and every,

00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:40.350
so what?

00:00:40.350 --> 00:00:44.850
We need to connect a security groups on index tickle by default.

00:00:44.850 --> 00:00:47.150
All inbound traffic is Look,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.900
if you check you were installs the stars,

00:00:50.900 --> 00:00:55.170
which you have collected every time it will be a part off insecure.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:01:10.950
Here you can see my distant stars is part off the security groups.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.470
Which name is security group for windows.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:16.880
And if you click on immune boundary walls,

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:19.780
you will be able to see whatever that was you have green.

00:01:19.780 --> 00:01:21.560
So what?

00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:25.500
I can see here that this is the part off security group for with those over.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:27.580
And if I go to security gurus,

00:01:27.580 --> 00:01:31.760
I can find this good.

00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:34.680
And if you see here,

00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:38.420
I can also verify that water in Montrose I have created.

00:01:38.420 --> 00:01:44.360
So right now I can see that I have created as to repair noted by default all in Bonn,

00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.750
traffic is blocked.

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:49.590
This is important for a young point off you.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:59.760
Many times you asked that is any inventor support by is open by default on Brown Put our I

00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.290
am bite.

00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.520
If all all our won't,

00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:03.240
I think is allowed in security.

00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:10.750
If even you deluded this still you don't need to create any separate rule for this Our own

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:17.530
room for this old one traffic and by default it is alone therefore also called state full

00:02:17.530 --> 00:02:21.600
state fools.

00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.140
So security grows,

00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:24.410
our state falls.

00:02:24.410 --> 00:02:26.000
There is 2.0,

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:26.850
we need toe.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:27.880
Uh,

00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:32.650
keep in mind that one is security groups are state full.

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:37.050
That missed we don't need to create any Are won't rule for them particularly.

00:02:37.050 --> 00:02:38.720
And second,

00:02:38.720 --> 00:02:41.890
is that all inbound traffic is by default below.

00:02:41.890 --> 00:02:43.110
So we have.

00:02:43.110 --> 00:02:44.930
If you want to open any port,

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.840
we need toe open it by a manual.

00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.710
Apart from this,

00:02:51.710 --> 00:02:57.180
there is another house comes which is called placement baseman Group is very important,

00:02:57.180 --> 00:02:57.820
for example,

00:02:57.820 --> 00:03:02.220
into a few and basically what it does that it is not available.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.270
First off all,

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:06.580
it is not a level into to micro stance,

00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:09.850
which is available in the feeder but placement group.

00:03:09.850 --> 00:03:10.900
What it does for you,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:14.050
it provides you high dispute land connectivity.

00:03:14.050 --> 00:03:21.910
So if you want that all off your servers be connected with high speed land that this off 10

00:03:21.910 --> 00:03:23.480
gigabyte network,

00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.380
you can use placement.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:25.630
Good.

00:03:25.630 --> 00:03:34.970
So when you don't yourself work off higher capacity like if you use M 47 or C four sever,

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:36.890
you will found are one option.

00:03:36.890 --> 00:03:38.970
Why launching placement group?

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:40.340
What you can do,

00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:47.350
you can create a policeman group name and here you simply need to create any group.

00:03:47.350 --> 00:03:52.800
And why launching this or were you just need to to your placement good name.

00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:55.980
So whatever the server will be part off.

00:03:55.980 --> 00:04:01.670
The same placement group will be collected with each other by 10 gigabytes network.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:07.680
So it ensure that you your service will get high speed connected.

00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:13.790
One important point we need toe kept in mind.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.810
What example?

00:04:14.810 --> 00:04:24.280
Interview that all serve us should be part off one everybody If you want to keep yourself

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.650
in same placement group.

00:04:25.650 --> 00:04:28.180
All those service will be part off.

00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.450
Same available to Jews.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:36.450
Other times we normally feels that is called GP.

00:04:36.450 --> 00:04:38.550
So keep yet is ah,

00:04:38.550 --> 00:04:41.680
authentication mechanism level in it.

00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.300
So once you create a keep here,

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:50.120
it's public God captured in keep you certain.

00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:52.590
Here you can see whatever the keeper you committed.

00:04:52.590 --> 00:04:54.640
That is one fingerprint which,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.250
having the public information,

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.550
it comes here.

00:04:57.550 --> 00:05:06.210
The private key part will be with yours and you will get downloaded This so like you can

00:05:06.210 --> 00:05:10.070
see that once in our foster were when we created one.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:10.750
Keep here.

00:05:10.750 --> 00:05:15.990
We have downloaded when file that is called dot PM and it is about by with key.

00:05:15.990 --> 00:05:19.030
So with the public and private key,

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:20.720
once it get authenticated,

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:22.360
our service get order,

00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.370
order indicated,

00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.150
and we are able to love it.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:33.210
And over summer another time is elastic.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:33.570
I p.

00:05:33.570 --> 00:05:39.810
So if you want to give any server a particular static,

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.860
I peered us because by default when we launch and the server,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:47.210
when the launch and easy to a stance it get public.

00:05:47.210 --> 00:05:48.010
I appear in public.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:54.060
Deena's the public I p has one property that it used to get change over their time or if

00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.660
you re starting or suffer because they are dynamic in nature but elastic.

00:05:58.660 --> 00:05:59.230
I abuse that,

00:05:59.230 --> 00:06:02.560
starting in nature so you can use elastic.

00:06:02.560 --> 00:06:03.080
I please.

00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:04.450
These are freely,

00:06:04.450 --> 00:06:11.840
I've furnaces and it is provided by a 50 from eight of Louis.

00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.280
And if you look it any last week,

00:06:15.280 --> 00:06:17.000
I people any easy to stars,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.050
it'll would doesn't charge for them.

00:06:19.050 --> 00:06:27.520
But if you associative if you allocated and not associate ID just like this,

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:36.640
then you will get charged a nominal fees by items because threatened IV's are limited.

00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:41.620
So Aws warned that we used plastic eyepiece whatever.

00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:46.150
We I look it whatever we locate for us.

00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:47.250
So here,

00:06:47.250 --> 00:06:49.550
if I associated with any server,

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:57.440
I am good to go and AWS will not charge anything for but another.

00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.300
There is one more condition adding to complexity,

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:03.750
like even if you're so what is shut down?

00:07:03.750 --> 00:07:04.970
In that case,

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:05.380
also,

00:07:05.380 --> 00:07:08.820
it almost we charge for last night.

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.660
So the condition is that your aws,

00:07:12.660 --> 00:07:14.460
easy to cast must be lonely.

00:07:14.460 --> 00:07:20.810
If we look for other options,

00:07:20.810 --> 00:07:25.130
you can check the options tax.

00:07:25.130 --> 00:07:30.390
You can check adoptions report so that whatever their tax you use in your environment,

00:07:30.390 --> 00:07:34.280
you can find it so you can see that windows ever have total.

00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:38.820
That's one instance faster.

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:41.140
Windows over is also have food tax.

00:07:41.140 --> 00:07:42.920
And when it stance running like this,

00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:44.750
you could check and many of your tests.

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:47.230
So whatever the attacks you are using,

00:07:47.230 --> 00:07:49.190
you can find it elaborately.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:50.980
And this screen,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.950
if you want toe,

00:07:52.950 --> 00:07:56.740
put out some reports for you are easy to a stance uses.

00:07:56.740 --> 00:08:03.850
You can use these reports section This is starts you can find at what is easy to start uses

00:08:03.850 --> 00:08:05.550
going on for your settles.

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.280
You see Tony seven starts utilization.

00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:12.360
If you are using any resultant stances in your and vitamin,

00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:15.260
you can get the report off of its chances to.

00:08:15.260 --> 00:08:20.650
You can also verify what are the limits.

00:08:20.650 --> 00:08:25.660
Every level in your comes like because I'm using a fitted accounts right now.

00:08:25.660 --> 00:08:29.720
Allow me 20 stances at a time,

00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.880
and if I want oh,

00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.290
create more than 20 incenses,

00:08:34.290 --> 00:08:44.870
I need to ask for this like this.

00:08:44.870 --> 00:08:47.350
Whatever the adult limitation in your count,

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:53.550
that can be verified and you can see that I can't not only one Of course,

00:08:53.550 --> 00:08:56.650
because I'm using accordingly.

00:08:56.650 --> 00:08:56.960
I can,

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:57.830
Until verified,

00:08:57.830 --> 00:09:05.780
we will have another points like what are the different stars?

00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:06.350
This type.

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:14.600
So that will be another other normally one town we used to face,

00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:15.770
which is called Volumes.

00:09:15.770 --> 00:09:17.770
So whatever this I waas you create,

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:24.510
whatever the hardest whatever the disk attached to it it comes in two volumes.

00:09:24.510 --> 00:09:32.410
So here I can see that my Windows server has one which is did you my one toast over the

00:09:32.410 --> 00:09:34.880
Land X over which we have knowledge it has led me.

00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.240
If they want,

00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:39.600
I can create another wall.

00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:47.610
You and I simply I need to create it and I can attach one major point.

00:09:47.610 --> 00:09:55.620
We need to focus that we need to keep the same available June in which of us are so the

00:09:55.620 --> 00:09:59.350
wall you showed me the part off Seamer Liberty June's off summer.

00:09:59.350 --> 00:10:03.460
It seems that us both matches.

00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:12.210
Then we conclude one can attach anything.

00:10:12.210 --> 00:10:14.980
We speak about backup in AWS.

00:10:14.980 --> 00:10:19.190
We need to keep in mind that there is a town which is called the snapshot.

00:10:19.190 --> 00:10:22.450
So any time if you go for backup in AWS,

00:10:22.450 --> 00:10:26.050
we can use snap shorts and why hasn't shores.

00:10:26.050 --> 00:10:30.400
We can take back up off our service.

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:37.070
We will check in other sections in the Abia section how to how we can take the back up off

00:10:37.070 --> 00:10:47.630
the service and how we can be another part.

00:10:47.630 --> 00:10:47.940
Come,

00:10:47.940 --> 00:10:53.800
which is called a my eyes and am It is very important for Lewis.

00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:57.750
And normally we use it number off times.

00:10:57.750 --> 00:11:03.870
So if you want to create your customised template if you want that you have to install some

00:11:03.870 --> 00:11:05.270
application in your cellar.

00:11:05.270 --> 00:11:09.020
Anyone that it used as a template you can use,

00:11:09.020 --> 00:11:09.540
am I?

00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.050
And it is a wonderful future.

00:11:11.050 --> 00:11:12.610
In my next section.

00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:17.930
You will go with am I And we will see how being can create our customers.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:21.400
Thanks,

00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:21.660
guys.

00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:25.510
I hope this one this session will be notice No visible for you.

00:11:25.510 --> 00:11:26.910
Defend any feedback,

00:11:26.910 --> 00:11:28.260
any flare and come in please,

00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:28.630
Like me.

00:11:28.630 --> 00:11:31.850
But if you If you don't have any other comment,

00:11:31.850 --> 00:11:33.790
please proceed for the next session.

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:34.550
Thank you.
