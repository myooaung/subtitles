00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.470
Okay,

00:00:03.470 --> 00:00:03.770
guys,

00:00:03.770 --> 00:00:04.790
welcome to this video.

00:00:04.790 --> 00:00:06.400
So in the last video,

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:11.460
we have gone through the critical part off nor balancing and auto scaling.

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.450
We understand the concept off load,

00:00:13.450 --> 00:00:14.320
balancing an overdose,

00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:21.080
killing we if we understand how we have to use and where we can use load balancer and auto

00:00:21.080 --> 00:00:21.430
scaling.

00:00:21.430 --> 00:00:26.290
Now this video is a left park and the we will do.

00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:30.570
That thing's practically we will create a load balancer and we will check.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:34.210
Ha load balancer works.

00:00:34.210 --> 00:00:36.680
So what I have done,

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:38.680
I have set up to 30 years.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:40.640
Who is your doing?

00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:41.310
Stances?

00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.470
This is ever 1 December two and what I have done,

00:00:47.470 --> 00:00:48.770
Uh,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:54.340
let's give it the name off West Server Gero Gero too.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:01.670
And these two servers have different most states.

00:01:01.670 --> 00:01:04.980
So to show you,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:07.700
like how it is actually load balance are working.

00:01:07.700 --> 00:01:11.380
I put some different content on both off these settlers.

00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:12.930
So where it is coming?

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:14.250
Welcome for AWS running.

00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:14.760
This is over.

00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:15.410
Welcome piece.

00:01:15.410 --> 00:01:16.450
This is serve on.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:28.560
And this is the word to which says Welcome to Citic.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:35.720
If this is a lot home piece so an ideal guesses what basically happens that we have to put

00:01:35.720 --> 00:01:40.040
the same content on both off the service or all of the service which are veer,

00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:42.160
which we are putting behind the load balance.

00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:45.580
But to show you like how load balancer is working.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:46.040
Actually,

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:51.970
I put different content on these servers now to set up a load balancer.

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:52.870
It is very simple.

00:01:52.870 --> 00:01:58.760
Just go to load balancer in easy to section step head of it,

00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:01.290
you would find create load balancer option!

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.160
And there are two different three different kind off few options.

00:02:06.160 --> 00:02:10.550
It is showing no and network load Balancer is quite relevantly new.

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:11.910
So what?

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:12.950
Actually it does.

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:14.650
You can see there too.

00:02:14.650 --> 00:02:18.300
There is a little classic load balancer which is used earlier.

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:24.130
And now it is off previous simulation and we can see that it is now on the state off.

00:02:24.130 --> 00:02:27.550
Retired in the placement off.

00:02:27.550 --> 00:02:28.610
Ah,

00:02:28.610 --> 00:02:31.050
previous classic load balancer it.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:37.630
Others have put network load balancer which supports TCP and there is a application or

00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:40.550
balance that with support s too dippy and Esther tippy a sport.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:46.750
The difference in these load balancer that via classic load balancer you can create all the

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.860
pores which you need as to DPS to DPS and TCP.

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.560
But after that,

00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:56.790
after some time they have differentiated and created some another load balance at which

00:02:56.790 --> 00:02:58.290
called application load balancer.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:03:04.890
And it only used to support a two DP in Esther TPS request and for TCP earlier,

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:06.720
there was a Lear.

00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:07.090
Still,

00:03:07.090 --> 00:03:09.450
we need to use classic load balancer,

00:03:09.450 --> 00:03:11.580
but now they have differentiated it.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:16.080
And now they put on a truck load balancer which will support only to see people's.

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:21.960
So this is the major difference between these load balancers.

00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:29.210
If you are hosting of up site as to DPS or STD P or S to TPS application load balancer,

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:29.930
it's registered.

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:34.380
If your application is hosted on some other port on some other tasty report,

00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:36.390
you can use network load balancer.

00:03:36.390 --> 00:03:39.620
That stuff will remain moreover,

00:03:39.620 --> 00:03:41.390
the same in boat load balancer.

00:03:41.390 --> 00:03:46.170
So let's see how we can create a application load.

00:03:46.170 --> 00:03:46.650
Balancer,

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:47.820
This is very simple.

00:03:47.820 --> 00:03:52.750
Just need you need to click on create put your lord balance and name.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:04:04.190
So the first step that we have to put our Lord balance her name and I'll put it refs Server

00:04:04.190 --> 00:04:06.070
Lord balancer,

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:08.370
This is Internet facing.

00:04:08.370 --> 00:04:14.020
You can also use internal load balancer if you have different free PC in your environment.

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.100
If you have your own way PC,

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:18.120
which is using by your company,

00:04:18.120 --> 00:04:22.650
you can use internal load balancer.

00:04:22.650 --> 00:04:24.860
How are we need to exit from and dinner?

00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.980
So I'll put a night suggest to use Internet facing Lord balance I paired us.

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:30.950
Type is we're using,

00:04:30.950 --> 00:04:32.030
like before technology.

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:39.790
So we will go with I p v food here is the listener.

00:04:39.790 --> 00:04:40.640
So listen,

00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:40.980
Eliza,

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:42.850
thing where your request will come.

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:51.300
So somebody put and the website name that request normally used to come toe 80 Put when?

00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:57.640
If it is secured you can also use secure the study p and then the Lord will in support will

00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:03.390
be 4 40 So there are two options to choose in listeners.

00:05:03.390 --> 00:05:07.010
Your request can come on as two db or as too devious.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.580
If you are putting yesterday appears in the next step,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:16.900
Next step you need to use you are SSL certificate which you can buy from,

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:20.790
um is in itself or from any third party company provider.

00:05:20.790 --> 00:05:28.240
They will provide you one certificate which you need toe upload and all off your transition

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:33.060
which will happen in the website like your credential when we are used to put on Web site,

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:39.120
all the convention and all the things which is going through your laptop from your client

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:45.980
to on the websites of Web server will be secured by using this SSL put.

00:05:45.980 --> 00:05:49.300
So in this case,

00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:53.910
I'll choose Esther Dippy and in the of Liberty Joan,

00:05:53.910 --> 00:05:54.640
if I go,

00:05:54.640 --> 00:05:55.960
I need to select.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:58.800
There are right now to have a liberty dune available.

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:00.960
For my reason.

00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:05.270
This is I'm using movement is it might be You are using us who's And there could be some

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:08.750
where people of liberty does available more than two.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:11.830
So this is the best practice,

00:06:11.830 --> 00:06:14.780
basically that whatever the service you are putting,

00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:15.720
very,

00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:19.770
you have to put them if you want to put them toe in different,

00:06:19.770 --> 00:06:20.660
every liberty dooms,

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:24.950
Obviously they will give you the benefit that your server will be part of different data

00:06:24.950 --> 00:06:25.490
centers.

00:06:25.490 --> 00:06:29.570
So it is best practice that we should keep our service among my people.

00:06:29.570 --> 00:06:30.090
Everybody,

00:06:30.090 --> 00:06:30.490
Jones,

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:36.020
if all sir was are part of one everybody June and suppose that everybody June goes down.

00:06:36.020 --> 00:06:38.650
So definitely your services will be impacted.

00:06:38.650 --> 00:06:40.970
How are you have put in multiple servers.

00:06:40.970 --> 00:06:44.040
But even if your data center is good,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.490
don't.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:46.550
You're multiple instances will not come.

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:49.350
I take one example Lake,

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:50.950
if I want to show.

00:06:50.950 --> 00:06:53.660
Ah,

00:06:53.660 --> 00:06:54.890
simple example.

00:06:54.890 --> 00:06:59.980
Like I put one side of Tucson was in same every liberty June and that everybody June goes

00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:00.370
down.

00:07:00.370 --> 00:07:02.450
So how will I am using to serve us?

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:06.450
My services will be impacted because that every religion is not everyone.

00:07:06.450 --> 00:07:10.400
But if I put 171 everybody doing.

00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.290
And 2nd 7 another absolutely.

00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:12.610
June,

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:18.790
If my one where server goes down or if my one ever Liberty June was dulled my services

00:07:18.790 --> 00:07:24.560
Willis tourism in every label do do another of a liberty to So it's better practice.

00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:28.720
You keep multiple Everybody doing here.

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:29.320
In tax,

00:07:29.320 --> 00:07:33.760
you can put you're detail.

00:07:33.760 --> 00:07:36.840
So in that Kiva Lukey,

00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:46.060
you have to put the key name like name and you have to put like with ferocity,

00:07:46.060 --> 00:07:52.220
gifts your location or,

00:07:52.220 --> 00:08:03.750
like USA department transport.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:07.950
Something relevant information you can keep here.

00:08:07.950 --> 00:08:15.090
Learn quickly,

00:08:15.090 --> 00:08:15.780
go next.

00:08:15.780 --> 00:08:22.020
So he did give me some warning that you are not using its two Gbps sport and Howard because

00:08:22.020 --> 00:08:23.710
it is more secure.

00:08:23.710 --> 00:08:26.650
It is suggested that you keep as to the pierce poop.

00:08:26.650 --> 00:08:29.500
I know we can ignore that.

00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:39.260
And after that again we need to true the port which we want and it provided by default.

00:08:39.260 --> 00:08:45.850
Vpc port we pieces security group and there s tippy port is by default Open.

00:08:45.850 --> 00:08:50.870
So here I need to go.

00:08:50.870 --> 00:08:54.150
And I can verify this one if I won't.

00:08:54.150 --> 00:09:10.380
So if you go too easy to death there should be one security group of level with the name of

00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:18.050
the four vpc This one And here you need to ensure that your estrogen report is allowed so

00:09:18.050 --> 00:09:20.950
headed You can see that it says all traffic is allowed,

00:09:20.950 --> 00:09:25.250
but the point is that it is refering toe this security group.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:30.660
So the incident stars is resisting military toe.

00:09:30.660 --> 00:09:33.980
This and security group will be able to access.

00:09:33.980 --> 00:09:36.650
But there there could be one problem.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:40.720
Like if any server which is not connected.

00:09:40.720 --> 00:09:43.390
Like if you are accessing it from your client,

00:09:43.390 --> 00:09:45.620
like from your laptop or from your deck Stop!

00:09:45.620 --> 00:09:46.710
Why Internet?

00:09:46.710 --> 00:09:51.650
You will not be ableto access this because you are not part of the security group.

00:09:51.650 --> 00:10:00.630
So the better practice will be that we can keep this for testing purpose any So what I'll

00:10:00.630 --> 00:10:00.890
do.

00:10:00.890 --> 00:10:07.430
I said that it allows all traffic and I choose anywhere.

00:10:07.430 --> 00:10:08.730
So source could be any.

00:10:08.730 --> 00:10:10.100
Well,

00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:10.890
what I can do,

00:10:10.890 --> 00:10:15.550
I can choose another group also like this one.

00:10:15.550 --> 00:10:19.330
And I would choose what boat I want to allow.

00:10:19.330 --> 00:10:24.410
Suppose I want to allow only Esther tip reboot and as such is not required.

00:10:24.410 --> 00:10:24.810
Actually,

00:10:24.810 --> 00:10:27.990
I want I can delete this and can save it.

00:10:27.990 --> 00:10:30.350
And I can use this one.

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:32.520
So let's play.

00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.700
Let's check with this.

00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:46.950
I choose one does a rules and I click on next.

00:10:46.950 --> 00:10:49.840
So in the next part,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:51.560
I need to create a target group.

00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:53.280
So what is Target group?

00:10:53.280 --> 00:10:57.880
Target group is the group of the servers where we need to target.

00:10:57.880 --> 00:10:59.280
It is our endpoint,

00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:03.130
the service which we will have toe put behind the load balancer.

00:11:03.130 --> 00:11:06.160
So for that we need to create one target group.

00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:10.780
And to create that the simple Give a name.

00:11:10.780 --> 00:11:14.370
That's settler Target group.

00:11:14.370 --> 00:11:20.250
I'm using a study reports so I will choose a report type stances.

00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:28.010
You can also choose i p if you required I want to point it to the stars is again my head

00:11:28.010 --> 00:11:28.300
check.

00:11:28.300 --> 00:11:34.810
It provided me the option off health check it always by default will keep monitoring off

00:11:34.810 --> 00:11:35.660
your environment.

00:11:35.660 --> 00:11:39.060
And it will just need to know what is the port you're using?

00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:40.450
I'm using yesterday's report.

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:47.070
And if you have any customers file like home piece dot PHP or something like there,

00:11:47.070 --> 00:11:48.450
do you need to mention it?

00:11:48.450 --> 00:11:51.370
I am using when an industrialist email file.

00:11:51.370 --> 00:11:54.350
So that is fine with me because it picks by default.

00:11:54.350 --> 00:11:57.140
If you go toe advance hurt,

00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:57.990
check settings,

00:11:57.990 --> 00:11:59.520
you goto port.

00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:03.110
So the port which we are using is right now the same port,

00:12:03.110 --> 00:12:05.100
like the request will come on a people.

00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:08.140
And my application on my website is also hosted on the people.

00:12:08.140 --> 00:12:13.470
If I want to put over right what I want at my request community put and it will get

00:12:13.470 --> 00:12:14.870
forwarded to some different food,

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:15.960
I can do that.

00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:20.340
And I can mention the Newport number here right now.

00:12:20.340 --> 00:12:20.870
In my case,

00:12:20.870 --> 00:12:24.490
it is fine because it to save held the threshold.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:28.720
So the number of consecutive health checks access is required before considering and

00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.610
huddled unhealthy target healthy.

00:12:30.610 --> 00:12:34.350
So suppose your target goes unhealthy.

00:12:34.350 --> 00:12:41.650
So it is that threshold Ven it considered the target point healthy.

00:12:41.650 --> 00:12:47.910
So right now my target is an LD and it will try to times to connect if that its forces

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:48.340
coming.

00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:51.710
So it is one attempt than another time will attempt.

00:12:51.710 --> 00:12:55.670
And if second time that a time will come and the response will come.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:57.030
So it says that Okay,

00:12:57.030 --> 00:12:58.790
my target goes healthy right now.

00:12:58.790 --> 00:13:00.130
My special is five.

00:13:00.130 --> 00:13:05.440
So it will pray five times before considering a unhealthy target to held it under it.

00:13:05.440 --> 00:13:08.850
Then this is the threshold event.

00:13:08.850 --> 00:13:10.580
It will consider that.

00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:11.340
Okay,

00:13:11.340 --> 00:13:12.730
my response is not coming.

00:13:12.730 --> 00:13:18.140
So how many times the failure should come that I declare that it is unhealthy trash and

00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:21.750
I'll target So I know it would right?

00:13:21.750 --> 00:13:24.780
Two times that first time that request goes.

00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:27.300
The response is not coming from the outside.

00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.450
It says that.

00:13:28.450 --> 00:13:28.770
Okay,

00:13:28.770 --> 00:13:32.100
my target is Hon LD but the count is one.

00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:34.390
It will not declare that my target is unhealthy.

00:13:34.390 --> 00:13:35.260
Then again,

00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:38.110
it will try and it will try to times and again.

00:13:38.110 --> 00:13:39.330
The response will not come.

00:13:39.330 --> 00:13:40.480
So it says Okay,

00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.200
my target goes unhealthy.

00:13:42.200 --> 00:13:49.090
You can change it two from 2 to 10 and I'll keep it The Louis figure so that my response

00:13:49.090 --> 00:13:51.890
time will be quicker on my lord.

00:13:51.890 --> 00:13:52.040
Well,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:54.160
in service update quickly.

00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.550
What is that?

00:13:55.550 --> 00:13:56.350
Dymo tape.

00:13:56.350 --> 00:13:59.350
So it is the time.

00:13:59.350 --> 00:14:03.150
It is their time.

00:14:03.150 --> 00:14:07.390
That amount of time in second,

00:14:07.390 --> 00:14:09.630
during which no response means that feel healthy.

00:14:09.630 --> 00:14:14.030
So it can be due to 60 seconds right now This So five,

00:14:14.030 --> 00:14:17.400
I'll put it bluest or two seconds.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.050
So if my request is that side is not responding in two seconds,

00:14:21.050 --> 00:14:26.980
this is a health check failure after how long it will try.

00:14:26.980 --> 00:14:28.140
So ah,

00:14:28.140 --> 00:14:29.130
the interval.

00:14:29.130 --> 00:14:32.020
Basically that approximately amount of time between health checks,

00:14:32.020 --> 00:14:33.320
often invisible target.

00:14:33.320 --> 00:14:37.450
So how many times off Bahaman in diverse review trait.

00:14:37.450 --> 00:14:38.700
So right now,

00:14:38.700 --> 00:14:42.650
this fire 30 and I will keep it on newest on five.

00:14:42.650 --> 00:14:44.120
The source scored.

00:14:44.120 --> 00:14:46.820
Its success like 200 is a success court.

00:14:46.820 --> 00:14:50.580
So whenever that X reply comes with the 200 source code,

00:14:50.580 --> 00:14:52.750
that means my website is successful.

00:14:52.750 --> 00:15:00.140
So I have sort of my target group to taste my target name.

00:15:00.140 --> 00:15:02.130
My health check protocol,

00:15:02.130 --> 00:15:06.350
which he used to check as to DP and Nitra unwanted,

00:15:06.350 --> 00:15:11.370
are also has jack settings and I keep it lowest and I will do next.

00:15:11.370 --> 00:15:15.540
This is the most important part.

00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:19.900
Like hair were actually putting our service behind the load balancer.

00:15:19.900 --> 00:15:22.010
So right now what I'm doing,

00:15:22.010 --> 00:15:24.270
I selected my boat off service.

00:15:24.270 --> 00:15:29.660
Giovanna and Julia to both have different websites and I click on a to register.

00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.100
So now,

00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.950
once I click a storage door on Port 80 So that means now's my service are actually got

00:15:38.950 --> 00:15:40.600
behind the load balancer.

00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:42.750
If you don't do this a step,

00:15:42.750 --> 00:15:44.950
then it is a failure.

00:15:44.950 --> 00:15:51.410
So you need to ensure that your service should be put at Tourister and should be behind

00:15:51.410 --> 00:15:52.360
your load balance.

00:15:52.360 --> 00:15:57.950
Now you need to click on review and we can check the settings.

00:15:57.950 --> 00:15:59.740
If we need to do any change,

00:15:59.740 --> 00:16:02.850
you can go to edit option and you can definitely do that.

00:16:02.850 --> 00:16:05.440
So I'll just review.

00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:05.940
After all,

00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:08.190
my Webster name is where several l B.

00:16:08.190 --> 00:16:09.860
It is Internet facing.

00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:11.830
Requests are coming honest people,

00:16:11.830 --> 00:16:19.150
and I'll put the settings and it is OK for me and I'll go and just click on Click on click

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:19.150
.

00:16:19.150 --> 00:16:20.370
Great option.

00:16:20.370 --> 00:16:25.030
Now what?

00:16:25.030 --> 00:16:28.030
It does actually in beckoned right now.

00:16:28.030 --> 00:16:30.260
My load balancer started provisioning,

00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.590
so you can check all my duties in load balancer here.

00:16:35.590 --> 00:16:37.590
The most important part is DNS name,

00:16:37.590 --> 00:16:39.710
which you can copy from here.

00:16:39.710 --> 00:16:45.560
And I think it will not be working right now because of this provisioning.

00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:51.320
Let's have a look on the my servers the state of once.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:51.600
Oliver,

00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.080
it says,

00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:54.140
Welcome port It always learning.

00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.550
This is our well compares.

00:16:55.550 --> 00:16:58.350
This is my second piece and what are different.

00:16:58.350 --> 00:16:59.850
You can notice.

00:16:59.850 --> 00:17:03.720
And they are putting on one behind Lord balancer,

00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:05.400
which you at least this one.

00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:08.060
So right now it says that we're not fine,

00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:13.160
which actually it should with a case because right now it is under provisioning.

00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:21.130
So it is making them ready to work and all the load Billions of the days I can verify.

00:17:21.130 --> 00:17:23.520
Here I can check the DNs name.

00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:28.360
I can check the status VPC availability,

00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.550
Joan applications load balancer.

00:17:30.550 --> 00:17:36.450
And what is that going to do it these days can also be fined from here.

00:17:36.450 --> 00:17:38.530
The status is right now proves meaning.

00:17:38.530 --> 00:17:39.510
These are the tastes.

00:17:39.510 --> 00:17:42.250
And if you go down,

00:17:42.250 --> 00:17:43.850
you can also change your everybody.

00:17:43.850 --> 00:17:44.140
Joan,

00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:44.950
if required,

00:17:44.950 --> 00:17:54.410
you can change your security group if you need and you can notice that on which target

00:17:54.410 --> 00:17:55.280
group it is going.

00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.720
So right now it is going on Web server TG and here you can added the rules also,

00:18:00.720 --> 00:18:03.850
if you need right now,

00:18:03.850 --> 00:18:05.310
whatever the request is coming,

00:18:05.310 --> 00:18:14.290
it is going to this target group and target group information you confined from left side

00:18:14.290 --> 00:18:15.160
are good group.

00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:22.160
And here you can see the required are good group where the request is going.

00:18:22.160 --> 00:18:29.400
So here you can see I'm fine with it.

00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:32.700
Right now it is going to have 30 g and it is fine for me.

00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:38.230
You might feel that it is but complicated.

00:18:38.230 --> 00:18:43.630
But if you do it one or two tens and I believe you will be able to get a good understanding

00:18:43.630 --> 00:18:43.980
of that.

00:18:43.980 --> 00:18:46.460
So on the listener part,

00:18:46.460 --> 00:18:47.120
that is fine.

00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.610
I good with this,

00:18:48.610 --> 00:18:50.150
it is going to help support easy.

00:18:50.150 --> 00:18:52.950
And that is what I just want to know.

00:18:52.950 --> 00:18:56.810
And I can check my load balancer performance also Ah,

00:18:56.810 --> 00:18:57.960
from the monitoring,

00:18:57.960 --> 00:19:00.380
which is also provided by eight of Lewis.

00:19:00.380 --> 00:19:05.580
And they don't don't do any extra charge for that last two weeks report.

00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:06.900
You can find out right now.

00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:12.600
There is nothing much for it because it is right now in just very new in the environment.

00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:14.460
But if you have something,

00:19:14.460 --> 00:19:15.840
you can check the things like,

00:19:15.840 --> 00:19:17.200
What is your residency?

00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:18.130
Whatever the request,

00:19:18.130 --> 00:19:19.940
you are coming and excepto accepted.

00:19:19.940 --> 00:19:23.840
It is and tax.

00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:25.960
You can also find your element information.

00:19:25.960 --> 00:19:27.550
You are related to your account.

00:19:27.550 --> 00:19:31.460
So let's check what is the status right now?

00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:32.590
It might be active.

00:19:32.590 --> 00:19:38.330
So here you can see that the status goes active and this is basically the working status

00:19:38.330 --> 00:19:39.330
off a load balancer.

00:19:39.330 --> 00:19:43.000
So you can verify from here that my lord balance there is active or not.

00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:45.010
Let's go toe.

00:19:45.010 --> 00:19:50.870
That's my tons x my service directive and do Let's put,

00:19:50.870 --> 00:19:54.900
We're fresh on my load Balancer.

00:19:54.900 --> 00:20:02.360
It might take some time.

00:20:02.360 --> 00:20:03.630
Couple off minutes.

00:20:03.630 --> 00:20:05.280
Let me disc.

00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:05.390
Ah,

00:20:05.390 --> 00:20:05.760
peed!

00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:20.270
This you are lame again on open into a new tab and clothes The's one on it says that it is

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:21.270
not working.

00:20:21.270 --> 00:20:28.220
Let me try because I used this U R l in this soup browsers who might be I need to check in

00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.460
it in different poser or it will get refreshed after sometime.

00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:41.350
So here I am in different closer and I drive with the Lord Baron said OK,

00:20:41.350 --> 00:20:42.260
now it's working.

00:20:42.260 --> 00:20:43.710
So guys,

00:20:43.710 --> 00:20:46.840
waas my load balancer goes active.

00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:54.350
You can see that I really starting receiving the request on the request with air traffic

00:20:54.350 --> 00:20:55.510
which I am requesting.

00:20:55.510 --> 00:21:02.440
It will goes to one off my server to verify that my lord balances distributing the traffic

00:21:02.440 --> 00:21:03.860
or not what I do,

00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:10.620
I just reflects the speech and here you can see that the next request goes to a second

00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:11.040
server.

00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:11.950
So here,

00:21:11.950 --> 00:21:14.050
if who I requests,

00:21:14.050 --> 00:21:15.090
refresh it again.

00:21:15.090 --> 00:21:23.170
You can see that it is Gooding teach and the requests are coming way around robbing like

00:21:23.170 --> 00:21:25.760
one time request goes to one Sarwar and at second,

00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:27.030
because goes to different several.

00:21:27.030 --> 00:21:31.220
So let the Lord is getting this table to it here quite easily.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:37.230
And this load balancer also has the capacity that if my one server goes down behind this,

00:21:37.230 --> 00:21:38.900
it will automatically.

00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:47.340
It will automatically work and it will automatically forward that all the questo the active

00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.530
so it will not forward the request which is through the several,

00:21:50.530 --> 00:21:51.200
which is don't.

00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:57.420
So this is the capability in the cloud in for itself on in eight of this environment.

00:21:57.420 --> 00:21:58.420
Quite transparent.

00:21:58.420 --> 00:22:00.830
You don't need to do any thing change.

00:22:00.830 --> 00:22:02.760
If you're any service goes down,

00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.960
it really go automatically.

00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.350
So yet?

00:22:07.350 --> 00:22:08.220
Ah,

00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:09.240
we can see our load,

00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:09.630
balancer.

00:22:09.630 --> 00:22:10.300

00:22:19.740 --> 00:22:20.210
Load balance!

00:22:20.210 --> 00:22:21.480

00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:21.890
Task.

00:22:21.890 --> 00:22:26.090
It might feel you but do complicate in the starting.

00:22:26.090 --> 00:22:28.390
But if you do it one or two times,

00:22:28.390 --> 00:22:29.590

00:22:29.590 --> 00:22:31.160
