00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.365
So let's look at the following thing now.

00:00:02.365 --> 00:00:05.770
You will see that this domain name has www in front of it.

00:00:05.770 --> 00:00:07.585
Now it's possible that in your case,

00:00:07.585 --> 00:00:10.780
if you're trying to visit a domain as it is, that it will not work.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:13.540
So if you are trying without the www,

00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.565
this case, it's automatically added.

00:00:15.565 --> 00:00:17.230
You may get an error page.

00:00:17.230 --> 00:00:20.710
You may get an error page from AWS saying that he does

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.955
nothing configured with this domain name without the www.

00:00:24.955 --> 00:00:26.410
So if that is the case,

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:28.180
let me show you what you need to do.

00:00:28.180 --> 00:00:31.270
So going back to the S3 console,

00:00:31.270 --> 00:00:33.370
and I'll simply go ahead here,

00:00:33.370 --> 00:00:34.975
create a new bucket.

00:00:34.975 --> 00:00:39.220
This bucket name will be now the exact domain name,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:42.940
but this time without the www in front of it.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:45.895
And I'm going to simply go over defaults as they are.

00:00:45.895 --> 00:00:48.200
I'm going to create a bucket.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:54.100
Now the difference with this bucket is that will not contain any files,

00:00:54.100 --> 00:01:01.225
but we still want to use AWS S3 for static website hosting.

00:01:01.225 --> 00:01:03.640
So we're going to edit here the settings.

00:01:03.640 --> 00:01:05.575
Then I enable that.

00:01:05.575 --> 00:01:12.940
But this time we're gonna redirect to requests to another bucket or to another domain.

00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:17.980
So in this case, we want to enable static hosting and going to redirect the request.

00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:23.425
But the host name that we're going to enter here is the domain with www,

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:25.350
because you already know that that works.

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:30.125
So in my case it will be www dot learned DevOps dot link.

00:01:30.125 --> 00:01:33.484
And the protocol that we're going to choose is HTTP.

00:01:33.484 --> 00:01:40.280
As you remember, AWS S3 does not support HTTPS on EC2, some additional configuration.

00:01:40.280 --> 00:01:43.040
So I'm gonna save the changes here.

00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:49.175
And we should be able to get a link to this new bucket that we have created.

00:01:49.175 --> 00:01:55.880
And you will see now it's redirecting to the domain with www, my browser.

00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:57.770
This kind of details are automatically hidden.

00:01:57.770 --> 00:02:01.265
So if you click on it, you'll see here that it's still going to www.

00:02:01.265 --> 00:02:06.200
Now, still, that will not automatically work for you still need to An entry.

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.870
So going back here to the Advanced DNS entries,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:11.480
we're going to add an additional entry.

00:02:11.480 --> 00:02:16.010
This will be again an alias and use here AT.

00:02:16.010 --> 00:02:22.205
And the target will be the address again removing HTTP before that.

00:02:22.205 --> 00:02:27.080
So you will see the first entry is with www dot learn,

00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:28.955
DevOps, and so on.

00:02:28.955 --> 00:02:32.490
And the second one is we doubt W, W dot.

00:02:32.500 --> 00:02:35.870
As I said, if it's working automatically,

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:37.955
you also need to do this additional step.

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:41.780
And then it will recognize what to do in each situation.

00:02:41.780 --> 00:02:44.075
So they are practically as two different domains,

00:02:44.075 --> 00:02:45.265
but there are various points,

00:02:45.265 --> 00:02:48.180
ways to read or write from one to the other.
