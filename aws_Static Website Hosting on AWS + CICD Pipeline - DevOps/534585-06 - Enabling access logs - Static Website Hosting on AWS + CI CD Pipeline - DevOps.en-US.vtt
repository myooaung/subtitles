00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.965
Additionally, I wanted to set up something very important and that is also logging.

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:08.460
So unless you have like a no Logging policy,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.375
I do recommend that you have some logs for your domains.

00:00:12.375 --> 00:00:15.390
For that reason, we are going to create a new bucket.

00:00:15.390 --> 00:00:19.440
I'm going to call the bucket WW,

00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:24.345
my domain name, and then simply add dash logs.

00:00:24.345 --> 00:00:27.840
Leave the settings as they are,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.330
and practically forget about it for a second.

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:39.380
I'm going to go back to my bucket containing the actual website, revisit the permissions.

00:00:39.380 --> 00:00:44.330
And somewhere in this permissions you should see something like server access logging.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:49.475
So it will practically start writing any lock requests,

00:00:49.475 --> 00:00:50.915
any access to your bucket.

00:00:50.915 --> 00:00:53.900
And it's typically a good practice to have some logs just in

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:57.590
case something happens to know exactly what's going on with your hosting.

00:00:57.590 --> 00:01:00.380
So I'm going to go ahead and enable that.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:04.730
And what we can do here is to specify our target bucket.

00:01:04.730 --> 00:01:09.575
So our target bucket will be the bucket with logs.

00:01:09.575 --> 00:01:12.995
I'm going to choose simply this one.

00:01:12.995 --> 00:01:14.705
This is the bucket name,

00:01:14.705 --> 00:01:23.255
and we can simply specify a prefix like logs or access and simply save the changes.

00:01:23.255 --> 00:01:25.085
What will happen?

00:01:25.085 --> 00:01:27.635
And this typically takes a while.

00:01:27.635 --> 00:01:30.005
You go inside this bucket,

00:01:30.005 --> 00:01:34.655
you should be able to see after a while some access files being logged there.

00:01:34.655 --> 00:01:37.190
Just forget about it right now and we'll come back

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:39.770
to this later to see if it properly worked.

00:01:39.770 --> 00:01:44.580
The main idea is that I highly recommend that you enable this.
