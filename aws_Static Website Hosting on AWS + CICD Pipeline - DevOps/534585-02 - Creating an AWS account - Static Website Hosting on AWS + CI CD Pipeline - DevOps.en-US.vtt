00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.360
Amazon Web Services, or simply AWS,

00:00:03.360 --> 00:00:05.355
is a cloud platform offering

00:00:05.355 --> 00:00:10.635
over 170 services available in data centers all over the world.

00:00:10.635 --> 00:00:13.530
Such services include virtual servers,

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:16.080
managed databases, file storage,

00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:19.020
content delivery, and many others.

00:00:19.020 --> 00:00:22.395
If you don't already have an AWS account,

00:00:22.395 --> 00:00:25.180
it's quite easy to create 10.

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:31.090
Enter your personal details and click on Continue.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:37.050
If you are using this account for professional purposes like within

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:42.025
your organization or plan to do deployments or to use AWS within your organization.

00:00:42.025 --> 00:00:47.555
Professional. Otherwise, if you are just learning AWS and experimenting with it,

00:00:47.555 --> 00:00:50.730
It's absolutely okay to start with a personal account.

00:00:55.510 --> 00:00:58.160
And ws is a paid service.

00:00:58.160 --> 00:01:02.510
And even though in the beginning there is a free tier which has some limits

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:07.070
and it's ideal for learning AWS and experimenting this theory card,

00:01:07.070 --> 00:01:12.170
a credit card or debit card from you just in case you go over the free limit.

00:01:12.170 --> 00:01:15.125
So yeah, eventually AWS is a business,

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:16.550
so they're trying to make money.

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:19.355
This is why you need to input your credit card information here.

00:01:19.355 --> 00:01:22.595
Otherwise you will not be able to use AWS.

00:01:22.595 --> 00:01:25.890
And I'm going to add this credit card information.

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:31.200
And additionally, I also have to verify my phone number.

00:01:33.490 --> 00:01:39.210
Now my identity has been verified and I can start using my AWS account.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.635
Aws also have a support system and you can select the support plan.

00:01:44.635 --> 00:01:49.135
I personally think that their support is actually very, very good.

00:01:49.135 --> 00:01:51.430
But you will only need support from them if

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:54.265
you're deploying AWS within your organization.

00:01:54.265 --> 00:01:57.325
So for just learning purposes and getting started,

00:01:57.325 --> 00:01:58.870
you don't need any support from them.

00:01:58.870 --> 00:02:02.755
You'll have all the support from my side when it comes to the content of this course.

00:02:02.755 --> 00:02:07.760
So we'll simply click on free and continue with a free basic plan.

00:02:08.610 --> 00:02:12.925
Now we have an AWS account that is verified. It has a payment method.

00:02:12.925 --> 00:02:16.015
And what we need to do next is to signing into the console because

00:02:16.015 --> 00:02:20.690
from the console we can access all the services that AWS has.

00:02:30.630 --> 00:02:33.670
You think the AWS management console,

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:37.450
it means that you have set up everything correctly and you can continue

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:41.680
with the rest of the course and start using AWS right away.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:46.105
Aws is distributed in multiple datacenters.

00:02:46.105 --> 00:02:49.390
And you have the possibility of selecting the datacenter that you

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:52.795
would like to use right here on the right side,

00:02:52.795 --> 00:02:54.685
on the top of the menu.

00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:58.404
Currently in my case I have US East Ohio.

00:02:58.404 --> 00:03:01.435
Typically, the US data centers in the US

00:03:01.435 --> 00:03:04.695
have a lower cost than anywhere else in the world.

00:03:04.695 --> 00:03:06.830
But you may want to check for

00:03:06.830 --> 00:03:11.030
your specific reason if you are interested in having those in your specific regions.

00:03:11.030 --> 00:03:13.250
For example, for data security reasons,

00:03:13.250 --> 00:03:16.730
many company within Europe preferred to have their data centers and

00:03:16.730 --> 00:03:20.465
their data from AWS physically located in Europe.

00:03:20.465 --> 00:03:23.195
So for that reason, AWS offers this service,

00:03:23.195 --> 00:03:27.480
but it is much more expensive than datacenters located in the US.
