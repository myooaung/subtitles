00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.710
Now, this is not everything that we need because you don't want to give

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:09.000
your customers or to anybody else and address that looks like this.

00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.125
You actually have bought your own domain name and we're trying to host that.

00:00:13.125 --> 00:00:15.360
So now let's copy this.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.600
The following steps will be different depending

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.050
on how exactly you're managing your domain records.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:28.255
So I'm going back to Nim trip.com and I'm going to click here on managing this domain.

00:00:28.255 --> 00:00:32.119
What we're actually interested in is managing the DNS.

00:00:32.119 --> 00:00:35.060
So there are some DNS entry that we want to change.

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:38.900
And what we're going to try to do is either add

00:00:38.900 --> 00:00:42.500
an alias record or a CNAME record for this domain.

00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:44.870
So I'm going to simply remove anything

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:48.750
that is already here because we're not interested in that.

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:51.995
And add here a new record.

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:54.485
I'm going to call it an alias record.

00:00:54.485 --> 00:00:59.375
This will be valid for www and the target will be this one.

00:00:59.375 --> 00:01:03.935
So I'm going to make sure that I don't have anything like HTTP.

00:01:03.935 --> 00:01:08.314
We should start with www, should end in.com.

00:01:08.314 --> 00:01:10.820
And of course, making this change,

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:15.200
it takes a bit until you can actually see your updated website.

00:01:15.200 --> 00:01:21.095
My advice is to check in five to ten minutes to see if this change a word.

00:01:21.095 --> 00:01:22.910
But in a worst-case scenario,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.795
it can even take up to 24 hours for this change to propagate.

00:01:26.795 --> 00:01:28.175
Be a bit patient.

00:01:28.175 --> 00:01:35.705
But ideally you should see something in just a few minutes after a few refresh attempts.

00:01:35.705 --> 00:01:38.915
And sometimes it's even worth trying out to your browser.

00:01:38.915 --> 00:01:42.545
You should be able to see now that your new website is available.

00:01:42.545 --> 00:01:47.910
So this page is then served from AWS S3.
