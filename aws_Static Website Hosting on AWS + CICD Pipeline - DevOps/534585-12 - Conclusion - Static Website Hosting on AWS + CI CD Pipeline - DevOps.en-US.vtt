00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.220
Since we're coming to the end of this tutorial,

00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:04.965
let's do a small recap of what we did so far.

00:00:04.965 --> 00:00:07.575
Going back to the AWS services,

00:00:07.575 --> 00:00:11.055
we can look back into S3.

00:00:11.055 --> 00:00:16.530
S3 we have essentially what our three buckets.

00:00:16.530 --> 00:00:20.160
So one of them is the main bucket with www and

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.195
the domain name that contains all the files that we're using in the project.

00:00:24.195 --> 00:00:26.205
And essential for this,

00:00:26.205 --> 00:00:28.020
we have specified a few things,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:31.650
a few permissions here in regards to the public access.

00:00:31.650 --> 00:00:36.120
But also like this additional configuration for the bucket policy that

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:40.840
allows essentially anyone to get information from here.

00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.410
And what I typically recommend is that you don't store any other folders inside here.

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:48.830
So essentially you could have a sub folder if you

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:53.000
go to your configuration for properties.

00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:54.815
And you can specify,

00:00:54.815 --> 00:00:57.410
if you're looking here at static website hosting,

00:00:57.410 --> 00:01:00.079
you can easily specify it in a subfolder.

00:01:00.079 --> 00:01:03.335
So we could have something like public slash index.html.

00:01:03.335 --> 00:01:05.060
That would work. But the question is,

00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:07.325
what would you like to have on the root part?

00:01:07.325 --> 00:01:09.769
Because that theoretically still accessible.

00:01:09.769 --> 00:01:13.790
So this is something that I don't recommend that you store anything else inside here.

00:01:13.790 --> 00:01:16.190
It just for security reasons altogether.

00:01:16.190 --> 00:01:19.730
Part from the permission things in the properties we have also

00:01:19.730 --> 00:01:22.850
set up here some server access logging.

00:01:22.850 --> 00:01:25.850
And this is the part with Access Logging.

00:01:25.850 --> 00:01:29.390
And as you remember, we have used another bucket nor to store

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:33.440
data access logs to take a bit until the logs are available.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:38.525
So typically wait 24 hours to see something inside the folder.

00:01:38.525 --> 00:01:44.240
And the other bucket without the www is simply there to create this reader.

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:47.570
Ok, So inside here the DNS settings.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.840
You'll see here I've created this alias record.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:52.100
Pretty similar.

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:54.680
You could have created a CNAME record.

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.230
My understanding I'm not an expert by any means.

00:01:57.230 --> 00:01:59.030
My understanding is that a CNAME,

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:01.715
we'll do another DNS lookup.

00:02:01.715 --> 00:02:05.330
So for that reason, alias record is typically faster.

00:02:05.330 --> 00:02:08.105
The way I did it here is pretty similar.

00:02:08.105 --> 00:02:11.090
Before DNS, I'm using Cloudflare.

00:02:11.090 --> 00:02:13.625
They have like a very powerful interface

00:02:13.625 --> 00:02:16.505
and also prepare for caching and many other mechanisms.

00:02:16.505 --> 00:02:20.660
Since here the service for registering domains has allowed me to directly added.

00:02:20.660 --> 00:02:23.630
This didn't need anything more advanced than this one.

00:02:23.630 --> 00:02:27.830
Since we have established how to upload files to S3 and how

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.985
to practically link as 32 or domain name.

00:02:31.985 --> 00:02:34.730
In the second part, we have looked at building this pipeline.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:40.100
So essentially the pipeline just takes any build process that you have if you have one.

00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:41.480
And in the second part,

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.435
it uses AWS CLI to automatically deploy any files that you have to S3.

00:02:47.435 --> 00:02:52.025
So essentially, you don't have to log back to the S3 interface.

00:02:52.025 --> 00:02:55.010
And especially if you're already using Git for your workflows,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.425
may be much faster solution.

00:02:57.425 --> 00:02:59.315
Thanks for sticking around until the end.

00:02:59.315 --> 00:03:04.100
I know that this has been a long tutorial and hopefully have managed to follow along.

00:03:04.100 --> 00:03:09.500
You will find a project files including the GitLab CI pipeline in the period description.

00:03:09.500 --> 00:03:13.880
I've integrated a continuous deployment pipeline in this example to

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.500
demonstrate to you how easy it can be to automate manual tasks.

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.850
See you next time. Bye-bye.
