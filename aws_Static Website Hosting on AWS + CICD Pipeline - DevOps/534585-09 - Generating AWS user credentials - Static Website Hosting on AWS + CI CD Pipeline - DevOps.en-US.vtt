00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.775
Now what happens here is that we need to tell AWS CLI like who are we?

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:07.815
Which, where's the bucket?

00:00:07.815 --> 00:00:09.570
Which region is the bucket, and so on.

00:00:09.570 --> 00:00:11.610
So there's still a level of configuration.

00:00:11.610 --> 00:00:14.009
And in order to finish that configuration,

00:00:14.009 --> 00:00:16.725
we have to go back to AWS.

00:00:16.725 --> 00:00:19.830
This is the main bucket that is hosting the website.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:22.425
And you will see here that we have defined this region.

00:00:22.425 --> 00:00:25.500
Typically what I recommend is that you select a region that is closer to

00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.635
you or closer to the intended audience.

00:00:28.635 --> 00:00:30.240
But it doesn't really matter.

00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:34.120
This has been automatically selected for me because I live in Europe.

00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.825
And this would be like the closest region that I have and I'm

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.590
interested in is remembering which region I am.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:41.990
And this is like the code for that region.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:46.730
So I'm going to copy this and I'm going to go to git lab ci and we need to

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:52.730
specify some variables just to help AWS CLI with a few things from this left menu,

00:00:52.730 --> 00:00:57.310
you should be able to see here something like settings, CICD.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:01:00.440
You will see here a block of variables.

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:02.510
I'm going to add here a variable,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.180
and this variables will be available to the job itself.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:08.210
So if I start typing something like AWS will

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.180
always see a few variables and we're going to use all of them.

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:13.715
So first of all, I'm interested in the default region.

00:01:13.715 --> 00:01:16.680
The default region that I want to use this US Central one.

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:18.910
So I'm going to simply add this variable,

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:21.670
initially going to specify two other variable.

00:01:21.670 --> 00:01:26.455
Going back to AWS, we have to use a service called IAM.

00:01:26.455 --> 00:01:29.425
This is for identity management.

00:01:29.425 --> 00:01:31.780
Here in the IAM dashboard,

00:01:31.780 --> 00:01:33.565
we're going to click here on users.

00:01:33.565 --> 00:01:39.325
And we're going to create a new user that only has access to the S3 buckets.

00:01:39.325 --> 00:01:42.655
Let's call this user GitLab CI.

00:01:42.655 --> 00:01:47.275
This will help us identify what is this user supposed to do or what,

00:01:47.275 --> 00:01:49.060
where are these provisions used?

00:01:49.060 --> 00:01:52.450
And very importantly, you need to select here programmatic access.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:55.930
So this gives us access to the AWS CLI.

00:01:55.930 --> 00:01:59.065
This is exactly the tool that we have inside preeclampsia.

00:01:59.065 --> 00:02:00.940
I'm going to click Next on permissions,

00:02:00.940 --> 00:02:05.545
and I'm going to go the easy path of attaching an existing permission.

00:02:05.545 --> 00:02:08.395
So if I search here for S3,

00:02:08.395 --> 00:02:10.720
I will select this permission,

00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.330
Amazon S3, full access.

00:02:13.330 --> 00:02:18.805
This permission means that you're giving this user access to all your buckets.

00:02:18.805 --> 00:02:22.420
And essentially the user can delete all the buckets and so on.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:26.290
I'm just using this permission because it's just demonstrating the principle.

00:02:26.290 --> 00:02:29.155
But if you have like a little buckets that contains sensitive data,

00:02:29.155 --> 00:02:35.740
it may be wise to create your own policies that restrict access to only specific bucket.

00:02:35.740 --> 00:02:37.525
Going to click here on next.

00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:39.069
Don't have any tags.

00:02:39.069 --> 00:02:41.875
And I'm going to simply go ahead and create this user.

00:02:41.875 --> 00:02:43.990
As soon as you create this user,

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:49.120
you will see here that you have like an access key ID and also a secret access key.

00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:51.790
And I'm showing you just to have an idea like how they look like.

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.165
I'm going to remove this user just after recording this tutorial.

00:02:55.165 --> 00:02:58.240
So in, just in case you're wondering why I'm showing you this secret here.

00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:02.545
What I'm going to do next is I'm going to copy here the access key ID,

00:03:02.545 --> 00:03:05.755
going GitLab CI and add a new variable.

00:03:05.755 --> 00:03:08.500
And this variable will be starting here with AWS.

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:12.445
And you can see I'm using AWS Access Key ID.

00:03:12.445 --> 00:03:15.625
This is a special name and this variable will be

00:03:15.625 --> 00:03:19.900
automatically picked up by the AWS CLI when you're executing this.

00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:24.540
So all the variables will be in the environment variables and AWS.

00:03:24.540 --> 00:03:25.835
We'll look into, hey,

00:03:25.835 --> 00:03:28.430
is there a variable called AWS Access Key ID?

00:03:28.430 --> 00:03:34.500
And I will use that variable in order to establish who is trying to use AWS CLI.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:38.045
And the same goes with the secret.

00:03:38.045 --> 00:03:41.480
I just want to make sure that I copy the entire secret.

00:03:41.480 --> 00:03:48.665
And variable AWS and paste here the value as well. And I'm simply added.

00:03:48.665 --> 00:03:54.484
Essentially what we did is to establish a connection between our AWS account,

00:03:54.484 --> 00:03:57.305
the resources that we are trying to access, in this case,

00:03:57.305 --> 00:03:59.810
S3 and GitLab CI,

00:03:59.810 --> 00:04:03.860
while at the same time giving only a limited access to this user.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:05.600
So this user will not have access,

00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:08.285
for example, to Use the management interface,

00:04:08.285 --> 00:04:09.560
but through the CLI,

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.735
it's possible to do many things,

00:04:11.735 --> 00:04:14.090
but they're only limited to the bucket.

00:04:14.090 --> 00:04:17.120
Practically GitLab CI will inject this variable.

00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.860
So I'm going to show you in a bit how that works.
