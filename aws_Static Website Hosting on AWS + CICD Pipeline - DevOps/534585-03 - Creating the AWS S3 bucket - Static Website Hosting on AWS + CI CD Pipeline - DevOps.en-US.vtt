00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.610
Why I'm here at named Chip.com.

00:00:02.610 --> 00:00:05.895
This is what I use for registering and managing domains.

00:00:05.895 --> 00:00:07.140
Typically they have very,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:11.670
very nice prices and the interface to manage the domains, it's okay.

00:00:11.670 --> 00:00:15.965
For that reason this is what I'm using and you don't have to use them.

00:00:15.965 --> 00:00:18.305
This tutorial will work with any domain

00:00:18.305 --> 00:00:21.094
regardless where you have registered with GoDaddy,

00:00:21.094 --> 00:00:24.485
Google domains, whatever the principles, absolutely the team.

00:00:24.485 --> 00:00:27.620
So the domain I'm trying to use today is this one.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:29.540
Learn DevOps dot link.

00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:32.150
Open up a new tab and show the contents of this website.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:38.960
You will see that it's currently just hosted here on this landing page from named ship.

00:00:38.960 --> 00:00:40.220
Nothing special about it.

00:00:40.220 --> 00:00:46.250
So what do I do? I try to do next is to create an AWS S3 bucket for this domain name.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:49.865
I'm here inside my AWS management console.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:53.015
And the service that I'm trying to use is S3.

00:00:53.015 --> 00:00:56.970
So I'm going to look here under storage and you will see S3.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:00.145
And I'm going to click here on the button Create bucket.

00:01:00.145 --> 00:01:03.880
Now we want to make sure that the bucket name is appropriate.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:05.410
So kinda type here,

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:09.880
www dot learned DevOps, that link.

00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:12.385
So this is the domain name that I'm trying to register.

00:01:12.385 --> 00:01:15.310
Select a region that is more appropriate in

00:01:15.310 --> 00:01:19.555
your case and make sure that you remember this region, especially this part.

00:01:19.555 --> 00:01:22.450
So the technical name of the region.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:26.275
And after that you can simply write here,

00:01:26.275 --> 00:01:28.000
go over different settings,

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:34.570
but simply go ahead and create a bucket from the list of available buckets,

00:01:34.570 --> 00:01:37.150
you should be able to click on it.

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:39.435
And of course you will see that it is empty.

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:41.465
Now, just a general remark,

00:01:41.465 --> 00:01:43.370
AWS has changed a lot.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:47.570
The interface of S3 of this management part here.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:49.820
If you're watching this tutorial bit later,

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.470
it may look a bit different,

00:01:51.470 --> 00:01:54.185
but the principles should be automatically the same.

00:01:54.185 --> 00:01:56.195
Just a heads up on that direction.

00:01:56.195 --> 00:01:58.160
As you can see normally at this point,

00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:00.560
we don't have no files inside here.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.970
So what I'm gonna do here is first go ahead and upload the simple file.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:08.000
I'm going to click here on Add files.

00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.800
And I'm just going to start with

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:14.030
a simple HTML file just contains something like hello world.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:18.110
So just to test things out and make sure everything works properly.

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:22.145
Will upload, should work in a second.

00:02:22.145 --> 00:02:27.360
Additionally, what we're gonna do is gonna look here at properties.

00:02:28.180 --> 00:02:32.390
And somewhere here you should see static website hosting.

00:02:32.390 --> 00:02:36.065
So I'm going to click here on Edit because right now it is disabled.

00:02:36.065 --> 00:02:37.730
So I'm going to enable it,

00:02:37.730 --> 00:02:42.470
gonna specify what is the document.

00:02:42.470 --> 00:02:44.180
So what is the index document?

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:48.485
In my case, the index document is index.html.

00:02:48.485 --> 00:02:54.215
And I'm going to specify the exact same page also for the error document is also

00:02:54.215 --> 00:02:56.750
useful if you don't have an error document and you're trying

00:02:56.750 --> 00:02:59.840
to host an angular website or react website.

00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:03.305
The index document has to be the same as the arrow document.

00:03:03.305 --> 00:03:05.045
We have here setup everything.

00:03:05.045 --> 00:03:06.980
This is exactly the name that we have.

00:03:06.980 --> 00:03:09.440
And I'll click here on save changes.

00:03:09.440 --> 00:03:11.795
And additionally going to permissions,

00:03:11.795 --> 00:03:15.845
you'll see here that public access is being blocked at this time.

00:03:15.845 --> 00:03:21.870
So we can unblock everything, save changes, confirm.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:28.990
If you're trying to get the link to this or we have to do is go to the properties.

00:03:28.990 --> 00:03:31.585
So the properties are here.

00:03:31.585 --> 00:03:34.840
And in a section with static website hosting,

00:03:34.840 --> 00:03:38.470
this will be the temporary address that we'll have for the website.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:41.080
So let's click on it and see our website.

00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:44.695
Oh, that doesn't look good. What happened?

00:03:44.695 --> 00:03:48.595
Well, what happened is that we still need to figure out a few permissions.

00:03:48.595 --> 00:03:53.785
So it is not enough to simply make here this public access.

00:03:53.785 --> 00:03:56.905
But additionally, when to specify a policy.

00:03:56.905 --> 00:04:00.340
In order to specify that policy which will be written in JSON.

00:04:00.340 --> 00:04:03.565
Going to click here on bucket policy on Edit.

00:04:03.565 --> 00:04:07.340
And we're going to take a look at some policy examples.

00:04:09.130 --> 00:04:14.480
The policy that we are interesting in adapting is something like this cranking read-only

00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:17.090
permission to an anonymous user because we don't know

00:04:17.090 --> 00:04:20.225
who is visiting or bucket who's trying to get this information.

00:04:20.225 --> 00:04:23.735
So we're going to simply copy this permission from here.

00:04:23.735 --> 00:04:26.735
Kinda go back to the management console.

00:04:26.735 --> 00:04:28.115
I'm going to paste it here.

00:04:28.115 --> 00:04:32.810
Originally, what we interested in is getting this resource name, right?

00:04:32.810 --> 00:04:33.935
So you'll see here,

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:35.690
AWS is making our life a bit easier.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.155
So with providing here the exact bucket resource name.

00:04:39.155 --> 00:04:44.705
So we can simply copy this and make sure that we're not replacing everything.

00:04:44.705 --> 00:04:46.160
This is how it should look like.

00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:51.275
So you have to adapt it practically your own domain name at this point.

00:04:51.275 --> 00:04:54.065
So let's save the changes.

00:04:54.065 --> 00:04:57.725
And you will see here now the access is in red,

00:04:57.725 --> 00:05:00.335
is just trying to alert you that, hey, by the way,

00:05:00.335 --> 00:05:03.215
everything that you have in this bucket is public.

00:05:03.215 --> 00:05:04.520
And for that matter of fact,

00:05:04.520 --> 00:05:07.280
I don't recommend that you store anything

00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:10.070
in this bucket that is not intended to be public.

00:05:10.070 --> 00:05:12.035
So be we're very aware of that.

00:05:12.035 --> 00:05:13.640
If you need to store other files,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:15.620
don't use the website,

00:05:15.620 --> 00:05:18.665
don't use the bucket for this website for storing something else.

00:05:18.665 --> 00:05:23.015
Let's visit again the website and you will see here, my new website.

00:05:23.015 --> 00:05:26.580
It seems to be working and this is absolutely great.
