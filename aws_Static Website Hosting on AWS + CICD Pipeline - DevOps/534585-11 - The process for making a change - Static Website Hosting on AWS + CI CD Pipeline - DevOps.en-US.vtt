00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.945
Let's make sure that we can make also a small change.

00:00:03.945 --> 00:00:06.060
So I'm going here inside the ID,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:08.820
I'm going to click on the source code,

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:12.510
kinda go to pages index.html.

00:00:12.510 --> 00:00:18.465
And instead of high people are going to say something like hello world.

00:00:18.465 --> 00:00:23.970
Very small changes like indicates how easy it is later on to make changes and deployed.

00:00:23.970 --> 00:00:31.770
And so I'm gonna say here like changed message. And we'll push.

00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:35.010
And of course again, the pipeline is responsible for

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:38.010
ensuring that I didn't break anything.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:40.290
So just as important is also to build

00:00:40.290 --> 00:00:44.060
process that will verify again if anything goes wrong.

00:00:44.060 --> 00:00:47.630
We'll also send you an email notification if something didn't work out.

00:00:47.630 --> 00:00:51.050
So probably you can just make your changes

00:00:51.050 --> 00:00:55.280
and continue doing something else without worrying too much about this thing.

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.505
So this is like the power of automation altogether.

00:00:58.505 --> 00:01:01.820
Just a few minutes later the pipeline has been successful.

00:01:01.820 --> 00:01:03.560
Let's go back to the website.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:06.065
It says high people, we refresh.

00:01:06.065 --> 00:01:07.505
And now it says Hello World.

00:01:07.505 --> 00:01:13.490
This is what it means to have a simple but very powerful continuous deployment pipeline

00:01:13.490 --> 00:01:20.160
in place simply takes a change that you have and the place them to your infrastructure.
