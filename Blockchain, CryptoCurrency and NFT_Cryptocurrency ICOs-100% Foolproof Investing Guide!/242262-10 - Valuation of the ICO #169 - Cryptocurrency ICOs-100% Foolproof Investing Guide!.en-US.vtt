00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.630
Hello,

00:00:00.630 --> 00:00:01.110
guys.

00:00:01.110 --> 00:00:02.150
Welcome again.

00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:03.220
Okay,

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:05.700
so let's talk about valuation off the ice.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:05.970
You.

00:00:05.970 --> 00:00:09.220
So here is where things become bit tougher.

00:00:09.220 --> 00:00:14.030
You don't have access to the more traditional means of checking how the business is doing,

00:00:14.030 --> 00:00:17.770
like price over earning or running per share.

00:00:17.770 --> 00:00:25.700
So you are also not likely to access to industry information on that particular issue so

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:29.850
that you can establish whether or nor the token prices overvalued.

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:36.900
So valuing companies operating in the crypto sphere requires a new approach altogether.

00:00:36.900 --> 00:00:39.950
Here are some points that can help you with that.

00:00:39.950 --> 00:00:42.810
First is functional value.

00:00:42.810 --> 00:00:47.040
This means were the value of the token is what does it use for?

00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:47.810
For example,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:50.430
Bitcoin can be used instead of Fiat.

00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.780
Currency eaters are another example because you need toe pay for using the atrium network

00:00:57.780 --> 00:00:59.040
when setting up,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:00:59.650
you know,

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:02.700
smart contracts or creating depths.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.960
All your tokens off this type issued should have some specific practical purpose.

00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:12.130
Second,

00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:15.000
this speculative value as an investor,

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.150
this is more the kind off thing that he would be interested in.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:24.480
This value is based on the amount you can own by trading the coin coins with a speculative

00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:30.250
rather than functional valuer designed specifically for fund raising and can be used to

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:31.900
help further development.

00:01:31.900 --> 00:01:33.280
One caveat here,

00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:33.820
though.

00:01:33.820 --> 00:01:37.230
If the investment is purely speculative,

00:01:37.230 --> 00:01:41.480
SEC regulations are going to apply now.

00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:44.420
How do I know if a token is worth buying?

00:01:44.420 --> 00:01:48.950
You can start out by trying to see word that buzz about it is,

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:51.950
though there seems to be a lot of investor.

00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:55.320
Does the mortar seem on make sense?

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:59.410
While we cannot use the traditional ways of assessing a business,

00:01:59.410 --> 00:02:05.670
we have other ways to do that on the ways our check the market size.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:06.360
You know,

00:02:06.360 --> 00:02:10.750
discounted value on da utility talk and model.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:14.420
So let's cover them one by one market size.

00:02:14.420 --> 00:02:19.520
So this market size is something that is relatively simple to calculate on.

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:24.820
It can be used as an indication off whether or not the product is going to sell.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:28.450
It's a problematic when use on its own,

00:02:28.450 --> 00:02:32.790
because getting a completely accurate figure is difficult.

00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:35.480
Second is discounted value.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:39.660
This matter discloses to traditional methods of evaluation.

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:40.330
Again,

00:02:40.330 --> 00:02:45.420
this is simple toe workout but should not be used on its own.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:50.860
This is because it might be tough to find equity in port and you will need to make some

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:52.490
basic exemptions.

00:02:52.490 --> 00:02:58.820
You were lead to estimate things like estimated written on this can were really difficult.

00:02:58.820 --> 00:02:59.750
Challenge.

00:02:59.750 --> 00:03:03.040
Third is Utility Token model.

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.000
This is something that was Dubler by Chris Burness K,

00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:13.050
and it is vitally used by those trying to get an accurate value off I C E o.

00:03:13.050 --> 00:03:20.630
The model itself can be viewed or downloaded by clicking on going to its site.

00:03:20.630 --> 00:03:24.710
You can use it as a template for your own calculation,

00:03:24.710 --> 00:03:31.430
but you have to download it to change out the figures if you like a more in depth analysis

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:31.630
off,

00:03:31.630 --> 00:03:35.700
Chris is thinking you should check out his article on the same,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:38.050
and it's very much ever live alone intended,

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.710
so the model can be very accurate.

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:49.070
But it is more difficult and also forces you toe rely on certain assumption if you are

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:50.950
prepared to put in the effort.

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:52.450
This is a great tool.

00:03:52.450 --> 00:03:56.080
Do you use but that note?

00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.200
Let's discuss what challenges are there in valuing I CEOs.

00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.350
Okay,

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:04.460
first and foremost,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.280
little or no project history.

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:06.950
Second,

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:10.540
projections are difficult to do with great accuracy,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.710
because success rates are very low.

00:04:13.710 --> 00:04:14.390
Third,

00:04:14.390 --> 00:04:18.250
the project itself should be solid and well thought out,

00:04:18.250 --> 00:04:24.790
but dips in the crypto market could impact negatively on the project Number four.

00:04:24.790 --> 00:04:27.750
These projects are designed at on the particular park,

00:04:27.750 --> 00:04:30.140
but if your platform like Ethereum,

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:36.850
this can be a problematic if the platform is hag or it fails in some or the other way.

00:04:36.850 --> 00:04:39.570
Now I know your rights.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:45.440
What right invest investors are offered can have a significant impact on how much

00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:46.830
investment there is.

00:04:46.830 --> 00:04:53.140
It was always be remembered that shareholders and token holders have very different rights

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:54.410
In this section.

00:04:54.410 --> 00:04:59.200
We will run through were the most commonly held investor rates are.

00:04:59.200 --> 00:05:05.090
You should see the rights being offered by checking the terms and conditions or by reading

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:06.360
the white paper.

00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:07.170
Okay,

00:05:07.170 --> 00:05:13.550
let's start one by one and talk about the talk A top rates for payment rate.

00:05:13.550 --> 00:05:20.250
This means that the token are going to enable you to pay for the use of the product.

00:05:20.250 --> 00:05:25.980
What is good about this is that it gives you a very clear indication off what your rights

00:05:25.980 --> 00:05:26.280
are.

00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:32.280
The downsizes that it relieved the founding off many other cryptocurrencies as such

00:05:32.280 --> 00:05:33.210
complete issue.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:41.540
Its own token on that increases the volatility off the market and gives investor too many

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.620
choices.

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:43.860
Okay,

00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:45.840
the 2nd 1 is access rate.

00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.270
This is one most commonly shoot,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:54.690
and it does exactly what it says it does allows you to access to the platform.

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:58.710
This is a good way for the company to raise money,

00:05:58.710 --> 00:06:02.000
but it is not such a good deal for the investors.

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.850
How many people will pay just to look behind the curtain?

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:08.270
Okay,

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:10.950
next is profit ship.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:18.150
This is the closest that you'll get to a traditional stock market investment.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:19.600
On the upside,

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:22.800
the potential return on investment is higher.

00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:24.140
On the downside,

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:33.540
these kinds of agreement do fall under the jurisdiction off the SEC third contribution.

00:06:33.540 --> 00:06:37.390
This enables you to contribute to the success of the project.

00:06:37.390 --> 00:06:42.390
It could be a in maintaining the network or it's a similar function.

00:06:42.390 --> 00:06:48.620
The problem here is that you might end up with one person controlling specific function.

00:06:48.620 --> 00:06:52.650
This defeats the whole object off decentralizing the project.

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:55.310
Next is block creation.

00:06:55.310 --> 00:07:02.230
You will be able to secure the network through the creation off blocks instead of having to

00:07:02.230 --> 00:07:07.910
solve complex equation toe a lot blocks you you are effectively being your token that the

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:10.070
black bloc will be solved.

00:07:10.070 --> 00:07:12.450
This is known as a proof off stick.

00:07:12.450 --> 00:07:17.950
The people with the highest stakes have more chance off looking new token.

00:07:17.950 --> 00:07:22.580
The problem is that not everyone will want to do this.

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:26.040
Next is governance.

00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:28.790
This can be good thing or bad thing.

00:07:28.790 --> 00:07:34.360
It is good because the investors have some say in the direction that the companies moving

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.950
in and may be able to make a useful contribution.

00:07:37.950 --> 00:07:44.510
It is a bad because there could end up being too many options opinions issued and this

00:07:44.510 --> 00:07:46.350
could stall development.

00:07:46.350 --> 00:07:48.610
Okay,

00:07:48.610 --> 00:07:52.250
so let's quickly summarize what we learn in this lecture.

00:07:52.250 --> 00:07:53.820
Number one.

00:07:53.820 --> 00:07:59.300
How to Start evaluating the business model that I seo uses Second,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:08:05.400
why the business might be having a token sale and what types of tokens says there are color

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:05.400
.

00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:10.250
Why is it important to know what the money will be used for?

00:08:10.250 --> 00:08:11.120
Fourth,

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:13.600
how to go about valuing the I C e o.

00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:17.480
And figuring out if the token is worth investing in fifth.

00:08:17.480 --> 00:08:20.380
What your rights are as an investor.

00:08:20.380 --> 00:08:24.470
Six word The challenges are when it comes to welling.

00:08:24.470 --> 00:08:27.210
I CEOs okay,

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:28.270
So with that,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.120
I am taking a pause here on day.

00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.050
We will continue in the next lecture.

00:08:34.050 --> 00:08:34.900
Tilden.

00:08:34.900 --> 00:08:36.450
Thank you very much and take care.
