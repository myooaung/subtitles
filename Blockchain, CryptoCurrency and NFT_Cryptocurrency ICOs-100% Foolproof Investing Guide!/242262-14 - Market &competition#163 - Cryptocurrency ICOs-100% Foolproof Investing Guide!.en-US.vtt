00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
Hey,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:01.340
guys.

00:00:01.340 --> 00:00:05.490
So let's talk about evaluation off the ice.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:12.390
Eos market prediction and completar analysts is so in this lecture you will learn how you

00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:14.330
can very fire with the icy oh,

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:17.350
market projection and competitors,

00:00:17.350 --> 00:00:18.120
analysts is,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:26.040
are realistic and whether they are not so you think they have a good idea and they have set

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:26.950
up a good team.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:34.560
Now we need to go a step further and make sure that there actually is a market forward they

00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.600
plan to sell.

00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:42.480
Remember that the value of the product is Onley ever as much as someone is willing to pay

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.580
for it in his lifetime.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:47.420
Vincent when gog waas penniless,

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:51.600
he better toe give his artery and couldn't make a good living from it.

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:53.360
Nowadays,

00:00:53.360 --> 00:00:54.550
it is very different.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.330
His work sells for millions,

00:00:57.330 --> 00:01:00.150
but it illustrates my point perfectly.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:04.660
You need to make sure not only that there is a market for the product,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.370
but also that there is enough off a market to make it profitable.

00:01:09.370 --> 00:01:10.700
The ice.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:13.850
You should have done some good market research,

00:01:13.850 --> 00:01:20.180
but you need to understand how to Iraq Kuwait it and come up with your own conclusion to

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:22.550
make an informed decision.

00:01:22.550 --> 00:01:28.650
Let's start over that some basic terminology that you are likely to encounter.

00:01:28.650 --> 00:01:31.640
So first,

00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:34.790
let's talk about total addressable market.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:37.020
It is abbreviated as D.

00:01:37.020 --> 00:01:37.350
A.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:37.850
M.

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:43.520
This is the total number of people that the ice you could possibly Cerrito.

00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:45.350
Let's say there are,

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:47.420
ah,

00:01:47.420 --> 00:01:53.950
budgeting that they're making the productive is budgeting top.

00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:01.190
The term is the total addressable market is would be all the people in the world who used

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.210
their cell phones to help them budget,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:05.760
regardless of location.

00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:07.320
Our demographics.

00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:12.250
It would be anyone that might possibly be entrusted in using the DAP.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.110
Secondly,

00:02:14.110 --> 00:02:16.250
serviceable available market.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:20.680
The Dem would give quite a large number,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:25.450
but it is not a highly accurate reflection off the actual situation.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:30.450
While there may be a 1,000,000,000 that the app would be often trust to,

00:02:30.450 --> 00:02:36.250
you also have to account for differences such as geographical location,

00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:37.980
language,

00:02:37.980 --> 00:02:38.610
etcetera,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:39.210
the ice.

00:02:39.210 --> 00:02:40.030
You would not,

00:02:40.030 --> 00:02:41.590
for example,

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.950
be able to sell the depth in North Korea.

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:50.040
They might have to limit the market to the people who could speak English,

00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:50.900
for example,

00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.780
and maybe narrow it further to those who use U.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:56.350
S dollars as a currency.

00:02:56.350 --> 00:03:02.680
The I C o will target people according to their own criteria to make marketing efforts

00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.040
small,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:03.450
fixed,

00:03:03.450 --> 00:03:05.850
focused and productive.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:11.890
Next come serviceable obtainable market,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:13.310
which is S O.

00:03:13.310 --> 00:03:13.750
M.

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:16.050
Now we're getting somewhere.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:20.900
This is a figure that you should pay the most attention do,

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:25.220
because it refers to the market share that the company thinks it can gin.

00:03:25.220 --> 00:03:32.140
So the total number of people who will actually by the DAP here you need to watch out for

00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:37.790
companies who over and freed this These numbers ah,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:41.790
market share off 10% to 15% is reasonable.

00:03:41.790 --> 00:03:47.210
But watch out for companies that project a considerable market share,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:49.720
like 50% or something similar,

00:03:49.720 --> 00:03:57.160
reaching this kind of market penetration takes a long time and is not so easily done.

00:03:57.160 --> 00:04:04.000
This is more usually an indication that either there or optimistic that they haven't done

00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.850
their research correctly are that they're trying to pull us camp.

00:04:07.850 --> 00:04:11.720
Third comes compound annual growth rate,

00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.600
which is C.

00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.380
A g.

00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:13.850
R.

00:04:13.850 --> 00:04:16.500
This is another important figure.

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:22.200
The compound annual growth rate is an average taken over a few years.

00:04:22.200 --> 00:04:28.200
Of the company's actual growth rate are projected growth rate again,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:34.010
This figure is important because it can be an indicator of how you return may be expected

00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:34.610
to grow.

00:04:34.610 --> 00:04:43.060
You don't need to watch out for over inflated figures here as well are 10 to 15% or even

00:04:43.060 --> 00:04:47.320
20% growth mean not seem as good as 50%?

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:47.670
See,

00:04:47.670 --> 00:04:48.060
e g.

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:48.550
R.

00:04:48.550 --> 00:04:51.150
But it is learn more realistic.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:57.050
Achieving high growth figures is also something that is not so easy accomplished,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:05:03.930
especially since the market changes on new entrance or global circumstances may shake up

00:05:03.930 --> 00:05:04.650
the game.

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:12.230
So ask yourself whether or not the projection makes sense in a light off current economic

00:05:12.230 --> 00:05:14.000
trends and factors.

00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.070
So how do I apply this knowledge?

00:05:17.070 --> 00:05:18.550
What's the formula?

00:05:18.550 --> 00:05:21.630
Now that you understand the terminology,

00:05:21.630 --> 00:05:24.930
have a look at the data that the company is provided.

00:05:24.930 --> 00:05:26.460
How detail is it?

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:28.950
How deeply had the drill into the data,

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:30.650
For example,

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:31.560
if they divided,

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:37.050
that s om up into different demographics or have they loved it all together?

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:41.850
Different market sector means that different approaches are required.

00:05:41.850 --> 00:05:49.800
Dismiss This makes segmenting the market correctly an essential task on something that a

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:56.400
serious icy over take into consideration if they're lumping all the sectors together their

00:05:56.400 --> 00:06:02.350
marketing efforts are bound to be less focused and less efficient for sure.

00:06:02.350 --> 00:06:04.960
So have a look at the figures?

00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.450
Do the statistics seem credible and logical?

00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.600
Let's go back to over budget gap as an example.

00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:17.790
How many people in the target markets are likely to buy it,

00:06:17.790 --> 00:06:23.980
Bearing in mind that users will need to be convinced to try it and replace whatever system

00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:25.450
they were using before?

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.730
Is a projection off 50% market share?

00:06:28.730 --> 00:06:35.770
Realistic now work though each of the figures and evaluate them individually to see whether

00:06:35.770 --> 00:06:37.330
or not they make sense.

00:06:37.330 --> 00:06:38.460
If they don't,

00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:42.290
it's time to move on to it out to a different I c e o.

00:06:42.290 --> 00:06:43.640
If there do,

00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:49.660
it's time to check how credible the sources for the information on and to see if you can

00:06:49.660 --> 00:06:52.120
validate the information on your own.

00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:57.650
Be very a white papers that don't live the sources for that information.

00:06:57.650 --> 00:06:59.900
Remember the Golden rule.

00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:06.650
A good team will want to give investor every reason to invest this beings finding credible

00:07:06.650 --> 00:07:10.990
and verifiable sources of data and linking toe these sources.

00:07:10.990 --> 00:07:14.020
If they haven't listed the sources,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.310
why haven't day is it because they have made the statistics up.

00:07:18.310 --> 00:07:22.600
Is it because they have used less than reliable sources?

00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:24.350
If the sources are credible,

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.080
the company has more to gain from listing them.

00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:29.650
Then they're not.

00:07:29.650 --> 00:07:30.770
Now,

00:07:30.770 --> 00:07:36.790
with any deadline is this is there will also be some underlying assumptions that have to be

00:07:36.790 --> 00:07:38.450
made final.

00:07:38.450 --> 00:07:39.690
What?

00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:42.150
These assumptions were in this case,

00:07:42.150 --> 00:07:46.650
the white paper should also reference these clearly.

00:07:46.650 --> 00:07:48.980
Okay,

00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:49.630
so,

00:07:49.630 --> 00:07:50.200
uh,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:51.240
you know,

00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:52.120
with this,

00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:52.580
you know,

00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:56.340
I'm taking a pause here on in the next lecture.

00:07:56.340 --> 00:08:03.550
I would be talking about how to check the market related data until them Thank you very

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:04.050
much.
