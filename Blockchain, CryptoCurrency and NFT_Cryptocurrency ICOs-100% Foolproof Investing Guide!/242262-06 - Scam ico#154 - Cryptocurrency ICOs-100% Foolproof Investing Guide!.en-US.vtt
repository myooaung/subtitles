00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.850
camps and how you can minimise your chances of being involved in them,

00:00:17.850 --> 00:00:21.210
I seals make for an interesting investment.

00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:21.950
Unfortunately,

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:24.090
not many people understand them well,

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:27.250
and there's been a lot of buzz about them lately,

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:31.510
trying that there is a very little regulation with these investments,

00:00:31.510 --> 00:00:35.680
and you have the perfect recite for con artists to have a field day.

00:00:35.680 --> 00:00:40.700
If you're going to start investing in the in this market,

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:46.460
you need to be in on your guard there I CEOs out there that are wonderful and there are

00:00:46.460 --> 00:00:47.880
those that are scamps.

00:00:47.880 --> 00:00:53.080
You can never be 100% certain that you that you are not going to get caught,

00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:55.940
but the tips we go through below will help,

00:00:55.940 --> 00:00:57.440
really was the risk for you.

00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.220
Now,

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:00.440
for the most part,

00:01:00.440 --> 00:01:03.250
view everything you are told with healthy receptors.

00:01:03.250 --> 00:01:06.510
Verify the information you're given,

00:01:06.510 --> 00:01:08.250
and if you cannot move along,

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:13.680
so look for the following negatives in the you know,

00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:20.450
I So if if you you know gettinto number one dies who is shrouded in secrecy,

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:23.610
They don't want you to know who owns it.

00:01:23.610 --> 00:01:24.570
You know,

00:01:24.570 --> 00:01:29.500
you cannot raise the domain name and you cannot assist the smart contract to see how they

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:29.850
are.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:30.560
Ah,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:31.210
set up.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:36.770
It's amazing how many people today will put up with anonymously online when they wouldn't

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:38.360
live in real life.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:42.220
If a stranger on the street come to you and offer to double your money,

00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:46.480
you would wonder why the catch waas And what the catch Waas.

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:49.020
You probably probably wouldn't do it.

00:01:49.020 --> 00:01:53.350
Why take the same chance online by the same broken.

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:57.400
If you were going to invest in a start up in the rial word,

00:01:57.400 --> 00:02:00.190
you would want to read through the contract first,

00:02:00.190 --> 00:02:01.110
wouldn't you?

00:02:01.110 --> 00:02:02.330
Okay,

00:02:02.330 --> 00:02:02.740
Ledgett.

00:02:02.740 --> 00:02:04.210
Tomate companies,

00:02:04.210 --> 00:02:04.770
you know,

00:02:04.770 --> 00:02:08.150
want you to be completely comfortable with investing with them.

00:02:08.150 --> 00:02:13.200
They will provide the information you require.

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:17.500
Scam artist will only give you what you want up to a certain point.

00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:22.480
They don't want you to understand too much because they don't want you getting wise to this

00:02:22.480 --> 00:02:22.850
camp.

00:02:22.850 --> 00:02:27.580
Ah hard sell our company desperate to push you to invest on.

00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:28.590
That's a point.

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:28.840
You know,

00:02:28.840 --> 00:02:32.150
You know the kind off sales person I'm talking about,

00:02:32.150 --> 00:02:37.320
the type that corners you in the department store and doesn't let go there charming.

00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:39.190
And you may even like them at first,

00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:44.430
but it quickly becomes apparent that they want you to buy something and that they don't

00:02:44.430 --> 00:02:47.150
intend to take no for an answer.

00:02:47.150 --> 00:02:49.490
If this happens with an ice,

00:02:49.490 --> 00:02:50.450
you'll get out,

00:02:50.450 --> 00:02:51.550
you know,

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:55.350
offered now you don't want to be pressurised into deciding in a hurry.

00:02:55.350 --> 00:02:57.690
You need to be left toe.

00:02:57.690 --> 00:03:04.300
Do your own research and alleged emit company will understand that if the I c e.

00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:06.450
O is closing in 20 minutes,

00:03:06.450 --> 00:03:07.880
look for something else.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:10.550
There is not enough time to accurately,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:11.600
you know,

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:12.750
SS that one.

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:14.520
Well,

00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:17.150
the next point which I wanted to highlight,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:21.100
is if the company is not verifiable or traceable.

00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:21.750
Arlington.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:24.360
Okay,

00:03:24.360 --> 00:03:28.750
Now I realize that many business people don't maintain their LinkedIn profiles.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:29.540
But a nice you know,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:32.970
that the serious about investors will ah,

00:03:32.970 --> 00:03:33.570
you know,

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:38.900
check out the names of those that are said to be involved and check the professes as well

00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:44.250
do the difference the project a tall Is there a company page forward?

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:49.860
It is highly unusual for nothing to check out whether the team members based what sometimes

00:03:49.860 --> 00:03:51.090
happens in that scam.

00:03:51.090 --> 00:03:56.550
Artists use the profiles of reputable looking people and claim them esteem members.

00:03:56.550 --> 00:04:01.560
So if you see what looks like discrepancies between the Lincoln Profile and the team

00:04:01.560 --> 00:04:02.260
profile,

00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:05.580
contact the team members on Linden Andres.

00:04:05.580 --> 00:04:07.140
The issue is a red flag.

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.540
If it is a genuine error,

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:11.450
you will find out quite quickly.

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:12.310
You know,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:13.470
if it is a scam,

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:16.430
you will know and you will have you know one.

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:19.450
The person who's the reputation is at risk as well.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:23.760
Is a company registered anywhere?

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:24.110
If so,

00:04:24.110 --> 00:04:26.220
the country's saw Ah country.

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:30.560
It is registered and could be an indication of how good the investment is.

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:31.510
For example,

00:04:31.510 --> 00:04:35.160
the laws in Singapore regarding I CEOs are more flexible.

00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:37.210
In the United States and Europe,

00:04:37.210 --> 00:04:39.350
countries are starting toe crack down.

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:44.850
That's not to say that all eyes he was registered in more lax countries are problematic.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:50.620
But you do have to wonder what the registered somewhere other than the country there buys

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:50.890
in.

00:04:50.890 --> 00:04:59.380
No fraudsters will often use accounts phone places like the Cayman Islands,

00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:03.100
Ma leaves on and on countries like that,

00:05:03.100 --> 00:05:09.630
it just does not bode well for the longevity off the company when they tried to sidestep

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.330
regulation in the country that they're based in now,

00:05:13.330 --> 00:05:15.670
what happens in two or three years time?

00:05:15.670 --> 00:05:17.550
Is there any going to still,

00:05:17.550 --> 00:05:18.660
you know,

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:24.180
be there in the company or country will exist are not okay,

00:05:24.180 --> 00:05:25.240
Next point,

00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:25.580
you know,

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:28.090
which is at the top of my mind is like,

00:05:28.090 --> 00:05:28.580
you know,

00:05:28.580 --> 00:05:30.320
our domain registrations,

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:33.160
and usually it is anonymous domain registration.

00:05:33.160 --> 00:05:38.300
Try running a search on a side like walls to see if you can find,

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.050
you know,

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:43.630
out who the owners of the site are.

00:05:43.630 --> 00:05:45.310
The site owners private.

00:05:45.310 --> 00:05:46.250
In this case,

00:05:46.250 --> 00:05:49.170
you have to wonder why the company's scientists,

00:05:49.170 --> 00:05:49.900
you know,

00:05:49.900 --> 00:05:52.980
is being owned by a private person or a person.

00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:53.580
Ah,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:55.990
perhaps the side owners values the privacy,

00:05:55.990 --> 00:05:57.520
and that is understandable.

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.580
But when it comes to realize you,

00:05:59.580 --> 00:06:05.980
surely they want every opportunity to reassure their potential investors that therefore

00:06:05.980 --> 00:06:07.500
really and on leave,

00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.150
you know,

00:06:08.150 --> 00:06:11.950
open every possible contact opportunity.

00:06:11.950 --> 00:06:12.850
No,

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:13.910
the other thing,

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:15.200
which you can see on the screen,

00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.750
right now is Ah,

00:06:16.750 --> 00:06:19.610
fun transparency company transparency,

00:06:19.610 --> 00:06:22.280
How they're working where the farms are going,

00:06:22.280 --> 00:06:24.110
where the funds are being utilized.

00:06:24.110 --> 00:06:24.660
Ah,

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:25.250
their eyes.

00:06:25.250 --> 00:06:28.290
He was out there that promise to return money to investors.

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:30.750
If they don't raise their targets,

00:06:30.750 --> 00:06:35.830
you know a legitimate companies will have you put the money into your escrow account that

00:06:35.830 --> 00:06:38.850
is usually administered by an independent third body.

00:06:38.850 --> 00:06:40.580
So it makes a good business.

00:06:40.580 --> 00:06:41.630
Says that way.

00:06:41.630 --> 00:06:42.920
You know,

00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.410
nothing can come and bite them in the butt later because everything has been handled in an

00:06:48.410 --> 00:06:50.350
aboveboard manner.

00:06:50.350 --> 00:06:51.720
Now,

00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:56.850
companies that don't do this are more likely to want to take the money and run,

00:06:56.850 --> 00:06:58.910
Asai said again.

00:06:58.910 --> 00:07:04.700
And other point is how transparent the company about its processes is it I s or registered

00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:06.000
company or whatever you know?

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:09.250
Does it allow you to have to look at the data and the progress?

00:07:09.250 --> 00:07:10.450
You know,

00:07:10.450 --> 00:07:12.320
there is a website now?

00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:12.670
Yes.

00:07:12.670 --> 00:07:16.540
Companies will want to keep the proper every preparatory data under loves,

00:07:16.540 --> 00:07:18.360
but there should be some Ah,

00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:20.210
limit that you can have a look.

00:07:20.210 --> 00:07:21.020
Ah,

00:07:21.020 --> 00:07:26.420
and if you want toe something like the smart contracts set up should Ah,

00:07:26.420 --> 00:07:26.720
you know,

00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:31.930
betray an appropriate three secret but still afford you the opportunity to see how they

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:32.350
work.

00:07:32.350 --> 00:07:35.810
Did they think it out logically and well?

00:07:35.810 --> 00:07:43.030
Is it well written are cobbled together The other things which come to my mind,

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:46.870
is how will you know that progress is made if you don't get the art,

00:07:46.870 --> 00:07:48.000
look under the hood,

00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.740
You know,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:50.000
what are the white paper?

00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:51.360
Do we have the white papers?

00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:54.850
There should instantly quell any desire to invest in the company.

00:07:54.850 --> 00:08:01.560
There be no thoughts given to whether or not the product is one that is useful and how to

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.050
go about bringing it toe.

00:08:03.050 --> 00:08:03.530
Ah,

00:08:03.530 --> 00:08:04.320
flotation.

00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:11.100
Now it is unlikely that there has bean any market research done beyond tossing some ideas,

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:12.210
toe fraud,

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:13.370
a friend and family,

00:08:13.370 --> 00:08:14.540
or perhaps a teammate.

00:08:14.540 --> 00:08:15.050
It work.

00:08:15.050 --> 00:08:19.110
So we will go through.

00:08:19.110 --> 00:08:24.380
You know what elements a great white paper should have in lated lectures.

00:08:24.380 --> 00:08:25.210
But for now,

00:08:25.210 --> 00:08:29.690
no white paper means that the company's sloppy at best or pulling a scam.

00:08:29.690 --> 00:08:34.280
It worse now another thing is whether things are,

00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:34.800
you know,

00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:38.840
comfortable convene a very convenient inconvenience free.

00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.700
So is it easy?

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:41.210
You know,

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:42.870
this is the hallmark of scam.

00:08:42.870 --> 00:08:44.910
Everything comes a little too easily.

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:50.090
They have a project that looks good on paper and that they know will be brilliant.

00:08:50.090 --> 00:08:50.820
You know?

00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:51.260
Ah,

00:08:51.260 --> 00:08:54.750
there are no obstacles in the way and everything is smooth sailing.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:09:00.680
There are hiccups along the road for any business and someone or price to convince,

00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:01.330
you know,

00:09:01.330 --> 00:09:07.190
convince them So the other thing to notice if the solution is so perfect and so easy to

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:10.850
bring into being of IRS no one else done it yet,

00:09:10.850 --> 00:09:11.460
you know.

00:09:11.460 --> 00:09:12.050
Ah,

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.060
And finally,

00:09:13.060 --> 00:09:13.470
you know,

00:09:13.470 --> 00:09:19.400
one more point which comes toe my head is what does your gut say?

00:09:19.400 --> 00:09:19.840
You know,

00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:26.740
usually the sixth sense you don't say is ah correctly do you get the feeling that it's all

00:09:26.740 --> 00:09:28.390
a little too good to be true?

00:09:28.390 --> 00:09:29.230
Ah,

00:09:29.230 --> 00:09:29.450
I mean,

00:09:29.450 --> 00:09:30.700
is it something,

00:09:30.700 --> 00:09:31.150
you know?

00:09:31.150 --> 00:09:32.250
Extraordinary,

00:09:32.250 --> 00:09:32.870
You know,

00:09:32.870 --> 00:09:38.560
and then it's most likely is listen to your gut and get out off their don't let green make

00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:41.210
you act on poor investment advice.

00:09:41.210 --> 00:09:43.550
It's the oldest con trick in,

00:09:43.550 --> 00:09:44.080
you know,

00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.190
in the lectures appealed to someone's sense of greed.

00:09:47.190 --> 00:09:50.580
And you can usually get them to believe what you want.

00:09:50.580 --> 00:09:51.610
You know,

00:09:51.610 --> 00:09:56.360
like never believe anything you are told in the spear and don't trust what the team say's

00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:57.530
without,

00:09:57.530 --> 00:09:57.870
you know,

00:09:57.870 --> 00:10:00.920
knocking it perfectly and verifying it.

00:10:00.920 --> 00:10:03.920
So in a nutshell,

00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:05.610
if I have to summarize that,

00:10:05.610 --> 00:10:07.450
you know ah ah,

00:10:07.450 --> 00:10:14.680
anonymity is dangerous anonymity when it comes toe who in charge of a nice you is usually a

00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:15.600
bad sign?

00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:16.530
Ah,

00:10:16.530 --> 00:10:17.110
number two.

00:10:17.110 --> 00:10:20.290
You cannot take anything that you are told at face value.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:23.250
Don't trust anything and verify everything yourself.

00:10:23.250 --> 00:10:25.280
Don't let anyone push you.

00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:27.190
Are rush you in tow,

00:10:27.190 --> 00:10:28.620
making a decision?

00:10:28.620 --> 00:10:35.060
Scammers often want you to come it fast before you have a chance to check things out.

00:10:35.060 --> 00:10:36.050
You know,

00:10:36.050 --> 00:10:37.790
the more secret of the companies,

00:10:37.790 --> 00:10:40.860
the more likely it is about it's a scam.

00:10:40.860 --> 00:10:45.980
Con artist will often promise you to pay the money back if they don't raise enough.

00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:47.060
Not like this.

00:10:47.060 --> 00:10:52.740
Lull you into a false sense of security again.

00:10:52.740 --> 00:10:57.610
Make sure that the money is paid into a suitable escort account so that the reforms are at

00:10:57.610 --> 00:10:58.360
the discretion,

00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.230
often independent third party.

00:11:00.230 --> 00:11:05.340
No white paper should mean that your money should stay in your valid Ah,

00:11:05.340 --> 00:11:05.600
good.

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:09.110
White paper is a road map to success vibrant a company.

00:11:09.110 --> 00:11:10.110
Invest in one.

00:11:10.110 --> 00:11:13.270
So if there are no problem and the process is so easy,

00:11:13.270 --> 00:11:17.520
someone else would have surely come up with the same idea before Now.

00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:22.090
If the team does not acknowledge that there might be a problem along the way,

00:11:22.090 --> 00:11:24.710
they're either delusional,

00:11:24.710 --> 00:11:25.520
you know,

00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.950
are scamming you.

00:11:26.950 --> 00:11:28.400
So Ah,

00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:29.050
finally,

00:11:29.050 --> 00:11:29.720
as I said,

00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.050
listen to your intuition.

00:11:31.050 --> 00:11:34.600
Gut feeling if it seems to be good to be true.

00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:34.880
Ah,

00:11:34.880 --> 00:11:36.380
you know too good to be true.

00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:37.350
Just work of it.

00:11:37.350 --> 00:11:41.470
And don't let the promise of easy money over ideal good sense.

00:11:41.470 --> 00:11:44.400
Eso That's it for this lecture.

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.190
I think it was a good discussion.

00:11:46.190 --> 00:11:46.980
Very in,

00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:47.950
You know,

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:48.220
we're in.

00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.500
You can check whether it's a scam.

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:52.660
What are the checklist on hide?

00:11:52.660 --> 00:11:55.950
How to identify whether it is this camp or not.

00:11:55.950 --> 00:12:02.590
So that that I'm taking a pause and we will continue over the next lecture in ah,

00:12:02.590 --> 00:12:03.310
