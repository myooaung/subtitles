00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.550
Hello,

00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:01.010
guys.

00:00:01.010 --> 00:00:03.310
Welcome to this new lecturer.

00:00:03.310 --> 00:00:06.380
We would be talking about crypto asset valuation.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:07.540
So recently,

00:00:07.540 --> 00:00:12.970
an increasing number of crypto market participants and observers have become interested in

00:00:12.970 --> 00:00:16.710
framework for valuing crypto acids over the years.

00:00:16.710 --> 00:00:17.600
Many are dino,

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:17.990
sir,

00:00:17.990 --> 00:00:24.320
Have I has proclaimed Bitcoin value less and asset worse than tulips.

00:00:24.320 --> 00:00:25.360
At least with tulips.

00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:26.580
You got a platter.

00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:31.950
Now they're trying to figure out how well these asset really are.

00:00:31.950 --> 00:00:36.150
That's a big win for the magic Internet money community.

00:00:36.150 --> 00:00:37.650
In this piece,

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:41.140
I share some early attempts at crypto evaluation toe.

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:44.150
Give perspective on how early we still are.

00:00:44.150 --> 00:00:47.670
Then discuss the curiam currently using and why,

00:00:47.670 --> 00:00:53.500
before walking through a fictional bandwidth coin valuation that includes a link on the

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:54.550
actual model.

00:00:54.550 --> 00:00:57.620
It's section operates as a stand alone,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:06.450
so feel free to skip among is them Now let's start with early days off Crypto s evaluation

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:06.450
.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.860
The first time we attempted toe value,

00:01:09.860 --> 00:01:14.620
Bitcoin was at a arcane wrist where I started as a buy side,

00:01:14.620 --> 00:01:15.520
you know,

00:01:15.520 --> 00:01:16.370
um,

00:01:16.370 --> 00:01:17.590
investor.

00:01:17.590 --> 00:01:25.290
In 2014 Heirarchy became the first public fund manager to invest in Bitcoin in September of

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:34.520
2015 on to do so we had to have some basis to justify current prices off $200 or at lease

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.650
quantified the potential for significant asset appreciation.

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:45.940
Other asset managers will have to do the same as part off their ah fiduciary duty,

00:01:45.940 --> 00:01:52.500
which is one reason everyone's become so interested in crypto s that valuation so below is

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:54.680
an example valuation from,

00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:55.650
you know,

00:01:55.650 --> 00:01:57.940
one of the papers,

00:01:57.940 --> 00:01:58.600
Andi,

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.670
off 2015 Air K investment,

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:05.640
which serves as a nice you know,

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.650
starting point.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:08.750
As you can see on the screen,

00:02:08.750 --> 00:02:09.630
you know,

00:02:09.630 --> 00:02:12.890
violence only simplified assessment off value.

00:02:12.890 --> 00:02:15.520
This graph gets across a few key concept,

00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:18.420
mainly total addressable market,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:26.780
which is stem reality covered this ah percentage penetration off the market velocity and

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:29.050
number of coins outstanding.

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:31.980
That thinking was as follows,

00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:32.880
you know,

00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:39.020
as you can see on the screen one second,

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.840
guys only bear with me.

00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:47.870
So as you can see the time waas you know Remittance in 2014 was for 36 billion.

00:02:47.870 --> 00:02:49.350
As you can see on the screen,

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:56.290
potential person penetration off that market could be 10% meaning Bitcoin Blockchain would

00:02:56.290 --> 00:03:03.290
have to transact 10% in tow a for 36 billion or 43.6 billion,

00:03:03.290 --> 00:03:05.290
to satisfy this demand.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:06.340
You know,

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:12.950
the same Bitcoin could be used multiple times in the transmission off value for residents.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:13.920
In this case,

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:17.150
1.5 times Spurrier has,

00:03:17.150 --> 00:03:17.770
you know,

00:03:17.770 --> 00:03:20.180
an own 43.6 billion,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.670
you know,

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:26.050
which is equal to 30 billion in value that Bitcoin would need to store,

00:03:26.050 --> 00:03:26.950
you know,

00:03:26.950 --> 00:03:29.130
So at the time off,

00:03:29.130 --> 00:03:29.720
you know,

00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:30.920
Ah ah.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:32.840
Writing or discussing this.

00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:37.660
They they were around 14.7 million coins outstanding.

00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:46.650
So an own $30 billion or 14.7 million which is equal to $2000 per Bitcoin.

00:03:46.650 --> 00:03:49.920
So the evaluation could be stabbed.

00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:58.140
With Bitcoins use in another target market with another percent penetration and Velo cities

00:03:58.140 --> 00:04:04.630
the value for each martyr target market would then be additive dwell demands on a single

00:04:04.630 --> 00:04:05.360
supply.

00:04:05.360 --> 00:04:06.570
Clearly,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:09.590
I was still struggling with all the very bill on.

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:09.870
You know,

00:04:09.870 --> 00:04:14.670
I report a couple of other manuals or Spencer Bogart and Guillory.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.880
They were doing better work,

00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.500
you know,

00:04:17.500 --> 00:04:22.100
at the time putting out reports on grayscale g btc,

00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:30.030
which which I would always recommend you looking looking at so I thought about Crypto s

00:04:30.030 --> 00:04:31.020
evaluation.

00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:31.400
Ah,

00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:32.880
lot more since then.

00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.250
So let's move Totori behind Crypto asset valuation.

00:04:37.250 --> 00:04:43.850
The first thing to note with crypto valuation is these aren't companies they don't have.

00:04:43.850 --> 00:04:46.370
Cash flows has are discounted.

00:04:46.370 --> 00:04:47.020
Cash flow,

00:04:47.020 --> 00:04:48.650
which is DCF analysts,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:48.810
is,

00:04:48.810 --> 00:04:50.230
is not suitable.

00:04:50.230 --> 00:04:51.260
Instead,

00:04:51.260 --> 00:04:57.750
valuing crypto asset requires setting up martyrs structural ease similar to water the CIA

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:01.540
would look like with a projection for ah each year.

00:05:01.540 --> 00:05:02.890
But instead of revenue,

00:05:02.890 --> 00:05:04.650
margin and profits,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:10.560
the equation of exchange is used to derive each year's current utility value,

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:11.540
which is sealed.

00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:12.890
We then,

00:05:12.890 --> 00:05:16.800
since market praise as that based on future expectation,

00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:23.680
one must discount a future utility value back to the prison to derive a relational market

00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:26.050
price for any given year.

00:05:26.050 --> 00:05:28.420
So,

00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:29.110
uh,

00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:35.840
if I believe in a taxonomy of crypto asset that goes far beyond currencies that said within

00:05:35.840 --> 00:05:41.100
its native protocol ah crypto s itself as a means of exchange,

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:44.200
store of value and unit off accounts.

00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.530
By definition,

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:52.080
then each crypto assert self as a currency in the protocol economy it supports.

00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:52.870
Now,

00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:59.020
since the question of exchange is usedto understand the flu off money needed to support an

00:05:59.020 --> 00:05:59.870
economy,

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.320
it becomes a cornerstone toe crypto asset valuation.

00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:05.650
Okay,

00:06:05.650 --> 00:06:07.250
No,

00:06:07.250 --> 00:06:15.020
the question off exchange is every physical toe pick you as you can see on the screen And

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.770
when applied toe crypto My interpretation is,

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:19.500
you know,

00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:20.000
again,

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.450
a musical the size of the s and base.

00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:23.300
You know,

00:06:23.300 --> 00:06:29.450
V's velocity of that be is the price of the digital resource being provisioned As you can

00:06:29.450 --> 00:06:29.660
see,

00:06:29.660 --> 00:06:34.360
the screen curious quantity of the digital resource being provision.

00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.890
So ah,

00:06:35.890 --> 00:06:39.700
crypto asset valuation is largely comprised off.

00:06:39.700 --> 00:06:47.170
Solving for em were a musical toe pick you by V m Is the size off the monetary base

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:49.270
necessary to support Ah,

00:06:49.270 --> 00:06:53.950
crypto economy off size speak you at velocity V.

00:06:53.950 --> 00:07:01.370
So let's start with B and Q as those seem toe trip people up the most.

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:07.260
The first thing to note is P does not represent the price off the crypto asset,

00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:13.150
but instead the price of the resource being provisioned by the capture network.

00:07:13.150 --> 00:07:14.480
For example,

00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:16.900
in the case off file coin,

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:25.510
it would be the price per gigabyte off storage provisions represented as dollar gigabyte

00:07:25.510 --> 00:07:29.310
burning of idea soak your present.

00:07:29.310 --> 00:07:34.290
The quantity off that resource provision in the case Off file.

00:07:34.290 --> 00:07:38.390
Coin the GPS off storage Multiplying.

00:07:38.390 --> 00:07:44.550
You know G B per dollar into G B comes or gives you the dollar.

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:49.510
This dollar amount represent the exchange of value in the file.

00:07:49.510 --> 00:07:50.750
Coin economic,

00:07:50.750 --> 00:07:51.840
the provision.

00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:53.250
Cloud storage.

00:07:53.250 --> 00:07:54.780
In other words,

00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:58.050
it is Judi p off the file Coin economy,

00:07:58.050 --> 00:08:06.240
which fits with classical monitoring Where P Q is a gross domestic product off a country.

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:08.940
Fortunately for crypto folks,

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:12.950
we have transparent and immutable ledger,

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:20.190
so practice GDP they are called block Chiefs Has the Judi P off crypto?

00:08:20.190 --> 00:08:27.550
Our network is represented by the unchain transaction volume offered crypto asset.

00:08:27.550 --> 00:08:28.530
Well,

00:08:28.530 --> 00:08:29.610
a side note.

00:08:29.610 --> 00:08:35.710
While I believe on chain transaction volume nicely represent a crypto network GDP.

00:08:35.710 --> 00:08:43.980
It is in perfect because often 30% off crypto assert on chain transaction volume can be

00:08:43.980 --> 00:08:47.350
shuttling the assert between exchanges.

00:08:47.350 --> 00:08:54.580
Doing so is not an exchange off value for the digital resource off the network,

00:08:54.580 --> 00:08:57.880
but instead a means off speculation,

00:08:57.880 --> 00:09:01.380
which is excluded from GDP metrics,

00:09:01.380 --> 00:09:02.720
for example,

00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:09.150
affects volume is not incorporated into the Judi P off nation states.

00:09:09.150 --> 00:09:11.610
Additionally,

00:09:11.610 --> 00:09:12.430
secondly,

00:09:12.430 --> 00:09:18.950
er scaling solution will make this assessment off GDP conservative dough.

00:09:18.950 --> 00:09:20.660
I would like likely.

00:09:20.660 --> 00:09:24.300
Consider the asset used in the second layers as bonded,

00:09:24.300 --> 00:09:28.950
falling into the bonded bucket that we discussed earlier.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:32.720
Or we will even have discussion later.

00:09:32.720 --> 00:09:40.290
So turning now toe V velocity shows the number of times and assess changes hands in the

00:09:40.290 --> 00:09:41.650
given time period,

00:09:41.650 --> 00:09:47.470
rearranging every physical toe pick you and we can calculate Visa Goto pick.

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:55.970
You buy em Taking Bitcoin in 2016 as an example,

00:09:55.970 --> 00:09:56.820
that year,

00:09:56.820 --> 00:10:05.060
the network processed an average of 1 $60 million in estimated USD transaction value per

00:10:05.060 --> 00:10:05.520
day,

00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.250
for a total off 85 1,000,000,000.

00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:10.150
In the ear,

00:10:10.150 --> 00:10:20.060
the every size of the Bitcoin as that bees doh and through 2016 was 8.9 billion.

00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:20.740
Hence,

00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:23.670
if he used the same formula visible toe pick,

00:10:23.670 --> 00:10:24.850
you buy em,

00:10:24.850 --> 00:10:27.450
it comes toe 6.5.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:28.700
Ah,

00:10:28.700 --> 00:10:38.420
velocity off 6.5 means that in 2016 each Bitcoin changed hands 6.5 times in reality,

00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:41.790
a small percentage off Bitcoin in the floor.

00:10:41.790 --> 00:10:45.450
It likely exchange hands a lot more than that,

00:10:45.450 --> 00:10:50.520
while a larger person did set lording Hodler's hands.

00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.230
But more on that,

00:10:52.230 --> 00:10:57.310
we will discuss for perspective the velocity off the U.

00:10:57.310 --> 00:10:57.560
S.

00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.080
D.

00:10:58.080 --> 00:11:02.550
M one money stock is 5.5 right now,

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:12.750
though this has declined precipitously since the financial crisis is off 2008.

00:11:12.750 --> 00:11:15.590
On this,

00:11:15.590 --> 00:11:22.920
you know you can see here as you can see in the screen.

00:11:22.920 --> 00:11:24.010
So lastly,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:31.450
the SNB's M Lord that I have used in every size of Bitcoins as head base through the ear,

00:11:31.450 --> 00:11:39.600
which is necessary doodle inflationary nature off the set accounting for an expanding

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:46.750
monetary base is particularly important for younger crypto asserts that could be classified

00:11:46.750 --> 00:11:49.150
as hyper inflationary.

00:11:49.150 --> 00:11:55.250
With annual raids off supply increase that clock in north off 20%.

00:11:55.250 --> 00:11:58.400
Now that we have covered the variable off,

00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:05.870
the question off exchange on turned upon the Islay off total addressable market and ah,

00:12:05.870 --> 00:12:08.700
percentage penetration off the market,

00:12:08.700 --> 00:12:12.110
there's one more key concept to cover,

00:12:12.110 --> 00:12:13.940
which is discount rates.

00:12:13.940 --> 00:12:20.400
We will do that in the context off an actual model in the next lecture.

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:21.880
So for now,

00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:24.250
I'm taking a pause here and,

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:25.250
you know,

00:12:25.250 --> 00:12:27.850
we will meet in the next lecture till then.

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:28.670
Thank you very much,

00:12:28.670 --> 00:12:29.350
guys,
