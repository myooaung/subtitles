00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760
says so in contradiction to over last lecture I'm carrying forward valuing a Bamber token i

00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:08.850
n e T.

00:00:08.850 --> 00:00:09.680
So,

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.050
before attempting to value a fictional bandwidth token,

00:00:13.050 --> 00:00:20.310
let me make clear that I don't use these models as price targets the way equity analysts

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:22.470
create price target for stocks.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:28.780
Their cover the granularity off our understanding off crypto economics is not there yet.

00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:36.060
And nor are the crypto markets efficient enough toe base a set management on racial market

00:00:36.060 --> 00:00:36.750
pricing.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.850
So I use this models to help me understand the livers of value within our tokens.

00:00:43.850 --> 00:00:48.690
Crypto economic model models help me as the right question,

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:54.690
and they also allow me understand what kindof adoption a crypto network will have to

00:00:54.690 --> 00:00:59.800
achieve to justify a certain A surprises as off now,

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:04.780
I found that people that get the most out of these models are developers,

00:01:04.780 --> 00:01:10.850
as it helps them think through the monetary policies off their soon to be launched network

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:10.850
.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:15.470
So here I'm talking about one off the models,

00:01:15.470 --> 00:01:17.150
which I'm referencing,

00:01:17.150 --> 00:01:21.040
so if you would like to fiddle with the exemption,

00:01:21.040 --> 00:01:25.430
download it so that you can get out off comment only more.

00:01:25.430 --> 00:01:29.750
I will share the Resource in the Resource column.

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:31.560
As mentioned above,

00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:38.870
this model attempts to understand the crypto economy off fictional token called I N E.

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:39.350
T.

00:01:39.350 --> 00:01:43.180
As it works to take share in the provisioning,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:44.560
or bandwidth fire.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:45.990
It's decentralized,

00:01:45.990 --> 00:01:47.800
virtual private network.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.500
Broadly speaking,

00:01:49.500 --> 00:01:51.500
there are four Section two,

00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.230
most of the crypto martyrs.

00:01:53.230 --> 00:01:56.190
I've bean Building Section A calculates.

00:01:56.190 --> 00:02:00.690
As you can see in the screen number of tokens in the floor.

00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:07.440
Section B quantifies the economy of the protocol using the Equation Off Exchange Section C

00:02:07.440 --> 00:02:15.060
project the percentage adoption off the crypto asset within its target market and section D

00:02:15.060 --> 00:02:19.550
discounts future utility values back to the present.

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:23.380
The tables to the left off A,

00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:30.150
B and C are all the import tables wherein I have put in I an 80.

00:02:30.150 --> 00:02:32.270
Supply should fuel imports,

00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:33.690
anything economy,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:36.840
imports and adoption car imports,

00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:38.530
imports of temples,

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:45.840
off assumptions and your assumption can be different from my exception that what makes a

00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.430
market if you want to test different exemption,

00:02:49.430 --> 00:02:53.730
all the important blue are particularly subjective toe.

00:02:53.730 --> 00:02:57.270
The right of the import table are the output tables,

00:02:57.270 --> 00:03:00.240
which showed the result off the calculation.

00:03:00.240 --> 00:03:02.140
Based on my import,

00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:05.910
I'm going to focus on the output neighbors,

00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:09.700
which will include a discussion off some key inputs.

00:03:09.700 --> 00:03:12.200
You can easily follow the formulas.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:16.900
It would like a deeper understanding off all the math now,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:18.950
starting with Section A.

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.050
Yeah,

00:03:20.050 --> 00:03:27.920
starting with Section A Ro Ros 2 11 are usedto Deter mine.

00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:34.930
How many tokens will be in the floor and therefore available toe the iron et economic

00:03:34.930 --> 00:03:36.460
withdraw 11.

00:03:36.460 --> 00:03:42.710
The particularly important output row number of tokens in Florida after bond.

00:03:42.710 --> 00:03:44.550
Er's on Hodler's.

00:03:44.550 --> 00:03:54.120
Now here's a basic pinking there this a certain amount off i N E d tokens issued in the i C

00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:01.450
E o in the case 75% of the total that will ever be in existence or 75 million.

00:04:01.450 --> 00:04:05.590
There's instant liquidity for those tokens.

00:04:05.590 --> 00:04:06.910
Dough off course.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:09.290
You can change that if you like.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:15.570
The remaining 25 million tokens are logged up by private early private investor.

00:04:15.570 --> 00:04:20.270
The foundation and the founders vesting over different periods,

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:24.050
depending on how the monetary policy is structured.

00:04:24.050 --> 00:04:28.120
The most important imports and was that I imagine,

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:33.290
will be controller still are the percentage off tokens love by bond,

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:34.840
er's on Hard Lear's,

00:04:34.840 --> 00:04:43.320
which you can see the import C 12 and see 13 with proof of stake and other consensus

00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:45.620
algorithm experimentation.

00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:51.970
I think we will see an increasing amount off bonding necessary by the nodes that supports

00:04:51.970 --> 00:04:59.890
and networks such a born incentive sent devises these Nords toe act properly are lose their

00:04:59.890 --> 00:05:03.790
lunch for the more second layer Skilling solution,

00:05:03.790 --> 00:05:12.040
like lighting are ridden will also affect it effectively born the crypto asset Facilitating

00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.730
a secondary economy off chin Whether or not the asset used in these second real ears have

00:05:19.730 --> 00:05:24.840
of elessar table depend on how frequently this settle onto the mean chain.

00:05:24.840 --> 00:05:26.570
Beyond this ponders,

00:05:26.570 --> 00:05:33.220
there's a person being hurdled by those that expect the tokens purchasing power toe go up

00:05:33.220 --> 00:05:39.300
and therefore users as a store of value to cash in on to future dates.

00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.960
So together,

00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.300
the Bonder and Hard Lear's take tokens out of the floor,

00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:48.670
meaning these tokens have a velocity of zero.

00:05:48.670 --> 00:05:49.250
Hence,

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:53.380
they are not in circulation and are pulled out off section B.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:57.220
My exploration off the i n e t economy.

00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:01.810
I imagine this will spark some debate and rightfully so.

00:06:01.810 --> 00:06:04.680
It should happen now,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:07.800
two notes out to note.

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:10.020
Since the supplies not inflating.

00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.540
Why organic mining?

00:06:11.540 --> 00:06:15.750
The North and this economy make money off transaction fees.

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.660
If you want to include mining,

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:19.850
that's easy enough.

00:06:19.850 --> 00:06:21.270
It just another law.

00:06:21.270 --> 00:06:22.000
Lastly,

00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:22.350
one off.

00:06:22.350 --> 00:06:28.780
My favorite import is Lifetime Off Foundation C nine and I have been using this toe.

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:34.450
Help teams think through the sustainability off funding for their foundation.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:36.560
Turning to Section B.

00:06:36.560 --> 00:06:45.200
Let's dig into the i n ity economic me recall that crypto asset valuation is largely

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:52.210
comprised off solving for em where a musical topi cube ivy in the table As you can see

00:06:52.210 --> 00:06:52.870
below,

00:06:52.870 --> 00:06:54.000
I enmity.

00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:56.470
Economic on utility value.

00:06:56.470 --> 00:07:02.750
Our port we are solving for M the solution of the shows up in the Rule 25.

00:07:02.750 --> 00:07:06.210
So Saul for em.

00:07:06.210 --> 00:07:06.710
Veena,

00:07:06.710 --> 00:07:10.280
We need B Q and We Peak and be Seen and Rowe,

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:16.130
19 with the cost per rgb for a user off i any TVP in network.

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:25.410
Nor that after 2018 p incorporates and animal cause decline off 16% which is in a column 20

00:07:25.410 --> 00:07:30.740
cause declines are a necessary part off Morse Crypto asset models.

00:07:30.740 --> 00:07:33.800
Given their deflationary nature off,

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.580
the resource is the provision.

00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:42.690
No Crypto asserts that Provigil Lorne Deflationary asset are off particularly interest to

00:07:42.690 --> 00:07:43.050
me.

00:07:43.050 --> 00:07:52.930
You can be seen in Draw 23 though it takes a few steps to reduce toe get.

00:07:52.930 --> 00:07:53.490
Q.

00:07:53.490 --> 00:08:00.200
I've always had to start with understanding the total addressable market off the crypto

00:08:00.200 --> 00:08:01.080
network.

00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:08.210
Often others hard done this industry analysts and can be found by hunting around or line,

00:08:08.210 --> 00:08:10.880
as I did with annual Global I P.

00:08:10.880 --> 00:08:14.790
Traffic reports from Siskel Toe Project,

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.640
the term off future years.

00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:23.030
You also need a reasonable assumption about the unit growth off this market going forward,

00:08:23.030 --> 00:08:25.450
which you can see in C 23.

00:08:25.450 --> 00:08:35.220
You also requires a projection of the person penetration that the Crypto Network will take

00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:37.270
off its target market.

00:08:37.270 --> 00:08:39.830
Who estimates such adoption?

00:08:39.830 --> 00:08:45.550
I use a simple as skull formula that allows me to dictate ah,

00:08:45.550 --> 00:08:48.750
few key import shown below.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.210
As you can see in the scream now,

00:08:52.210 --> 00:08:58.200
input include when the crypto network will launch and adoption will start base here,

00:08:58.200 --> 00:09:00.930
maximum share the network will take off.

00:09:00.930 --> 00:09:02.270
Its target market,

00:09:02.270 --> 00:09:05.240
which is saturation percent of in the network,

00:09:05.240 --> 00:09:09.330
will hit 10% over saturation person and amount of time.

00:09:09.330 --> 00:09:14.530
It takes for the network to go from 10% to 90% off its saturation percentage.

00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:20.130
These variable allow you to tinker with crypto network adoption profile.

00:09:20.130 --> 00:09:21.310
Lord,

00:09:21.310 --> 00:09:25.250
that blue represent a particularly subjective assumption.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.750
And all of these inputs are in blue.

00:09:27.750 --> 00:09:35.580
I have also included a small hack adjustments so that Krypton network starts off at a

00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:38.830
minimal adoption in ear one.

00:09:38.830 --> 00:09:39.540
Okay,

00:09:39.540 --> 00:09:39.950
guys.
