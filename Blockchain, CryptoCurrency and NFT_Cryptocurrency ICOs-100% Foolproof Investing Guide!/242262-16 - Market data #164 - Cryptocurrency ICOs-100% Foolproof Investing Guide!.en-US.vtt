00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.600
Hello,

00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:01.150
guys.

00:00:01.150 --> 00:00:02.180
Welcome back.

00:00:02.180 --> 00:00:05.170
So in Contra Nation to our earlier lecture,

00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:10.650
one of the key things to check by you is to check the market data.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:17.150
It is natural for a company to skew market data by focusing only on the positives.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:18.450
Technically,

00:00:18.450 --> 00:00:21.850
they're not doing anything wrong by doing this.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.450
But you really are not going to get the whole picture this way either.

00:00:26.450 --> 00:00:28.590
It's homework time again.

00:00:28.590 --> 00:00:34.550
You need to see whether or not you can confirm that the data presented is accurate.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:38.040
You can do that by googling a search term.

00:00:38.040 --> 00:00:42.970
Such a cell phone market size analyzes California,

00:00:42.970 --> 00:00:43.910
for example.

00:00:43.910 --> 00:00:47.520
If you cannot find anything quite that specific,

00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:53.550
you can try looking for statistic regarding the general market that is being targeted.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.380
From that information,

00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.800
you can drop the Tom Psalm and Sam these abbreviation for Ah,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.050
we're discussing earlier lecture.

00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:15.750
You can drop these three for yourself and see how closely it matches the company's figure.

00:01:15.750 --> 00:01:23.510
Look for the average C A g R for the industry in general and for the company if applicable

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:23.510
,

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:28.550
to see what potential there is growth for growth and future.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:29.950
Okay,

00:01:29.950 --> 00:01:36.350
the next thing to check is on do is analyzing the competent of analysis.

00:01:36.350 --> 00:01:42.810
So every well thought out white paper needs toe have a competent analysis.

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:50.850
That is where the company evaluates the competition in the market board direct on Indirect

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:50.850
.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:53.920
What competitors are out there.

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:57.860
Are these people doing the same thing dies your plans to do?

00:01:57.860 --> 00:01:58.740
If so,

00:01:58.740 --> 00:01:59.670
what is a company?

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.550
Unique value proposition?

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:05.070
Why should people choose them over their competitors?

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:11.880
Research into the size off the market goes hand in hand with a competent tive analysts is

00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:12.290
without.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:15.030
The proper competent of analysts is ah,

00:02:15.030 --> 00:02:22.650
company could make a number off costly mistakes be very off the company.

00:02:22.650 --> 00:02:26.730
If there is no competitive analysts are,

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:30.220
they say that they have no competitors at all.

00:02:30.220 --> 00:02:35.590
This is usually an indication that they have not done their homework correctly.

00:02:35.590 --> 00:02:42.950
It is highly unlikely that they have come up with a problem that no one else has ever tried

00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:43.730
to solve.

00:02:43.730 --> 00:02:48.180
If there do claim that they have no competitors,

00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:56.280
you also have to wonder why that it is it's This is such a pressing problem.

00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:59.990
Why are more companies not trying to solve it?

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.480
It could be that there is not a big enough market.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:07.460
Or it could be that people have found over there on the problem.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.550
Maybe it isn't important enough to get them to spend money on a solution.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.600
Whichever way you look at it,

00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:22.150
the fact that there no competitors is probably a bad sign.

00:03:22.150 --> 00:03:29.010
The competent of analysts should address the following things Number one.

00:03:29.010 --> 00:03:34.440
What companies have come up with a solution to the problem and what they have done?

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:42.450
What can this company do for doing the best for the best?

00:03:42.450 --> 00:03:44.270
Ah,

00:03:44.270 --> 00:03:50.660
company can't differentiate itself by offering better peaches about a prize or a better

00:03:50.660 --> 00:03:52.750
geographical over age.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:57.030
If they are just coming up with the same solution again,

00:03:57.030 --> 00:04:02.480
they're bound to be seen as following the crowd rather than as innovators.

00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:10.080
Now what barrier to entry are there when the new company wants to enter the market,

00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:14.760
they want as few barriers to entry as possible.

00:04:14.760 --> 00:04:16.470
However,

00:04:16.470 --> 00:04:23.270
they also wanted to be difficult for others to follow suit are they will lose market share

00:04:23.270 --> 00:04:24.280
pretty fast,

00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:27.440
check the barriers to entry for the market.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:29.470
The issue is considering.

00:04:29.470 --> 00:04:33.250
How long will they have the technical advantage for?

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:38.260
Are there any regulation to consider big example of Bit connect,

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:39.580
for example.

00:04:39.580 --> 00:04:40.390
Initially,

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.850
they were on a onto A.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:42.900
Pretty good thing,

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.100
however,

00:04:44.100 --> 00:04:48.760
was the SEC garden world they were forced to shut down.

00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:54.150
Is this company you are considering skating on thin eyes when it comes to a tighter

00:04:54.150 --> 00:04:55.050
regulation?

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:56.050
If so,

00:04:56.050 --> 00:05:00.940
they're not a good investment because your money can get stuck well.

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.270
Going through the information like this is time consuming,

00:05:04.270 --> 00:05:07.560
but it is worth putting in the effort.

00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:09.430
The more you want to invest,

00:05:09.430 --> 00:05:11.650
the more diligent you need to be.

00:05:11.650 --> 00:05:15.660
There are sites that make the process a little easier,

00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:18.140
so if you're pressed for time,

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:22.790
you can also check and refer on the side,

00:05:22.790 --> 00:05:23.270
the ice,

00:05:23.270 --> 00:05:29.360
your rates on the falling sites and the sites are I see your reading dot com.

00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:32.210
Smith and Ground is another side wearing.

00:05:32.210 --> 00:05:33.450
You can check the same.

00:05:33.450 --> 00:05:40.050
So in,

00:05:40.050 --> 00:05:41.150
in a nutshell.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.850
Believe Don't believe anything you are told in the white paper until you have verified the

00:05:46.850 --> 00:05:49.940
same by independent.

00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:50.600
You know,

00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:54.080
analysts is quickly to summarize.

00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:54.720
Ah,

00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:55.360
you know,

00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.950
in this lecture,

00:05:56.950 --> 00:06:00.350
we discuss about what garment industry dumbs mean,

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.040
how to interpret them,

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:08.960
how to carefully evaluate the data containing market reports on market analysis How to

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.040
verify this data externally.

00:06:11.040 --> 00:06:11.820
How to come?

00:06:11.820 --> 00:06:14.150
A video own conclusion.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:19.620
So that's it for this chapter on lecture,

00:06:19.620 --> 00:06:24.540
we will discuss more in the next lecture and ah,

00:06:24.540 --> 00:06:28.790
fresh new subtitle Eso Till then I'm taking your leave.

00:06:28.790 --> 00:06:30.150
Thank you very much.
