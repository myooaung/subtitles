00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.640
Hello,

00:00:00.640 --> 00:00:01.140
guys.

00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:07.490
Let's quickly talk about the components off a successful or agreed I c E o No.

00:00:07.490 --> 00:00:14.140
What are the stages off off project are the best times to invest as well to be discussed

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:14.480
here?

00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.550
No.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.560
Let's talk about some ice.

00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:25.430
Your success stories where investors ended up making a pile of money where investors squad

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:30.200
report their money in next to no time at all.

00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.780
Who here hasn't seen?

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:33.350
Ah,

00:00:33.350 --> 00:00:36.440
an article about Bitcoin billionaires,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.690
I see was at the heart and happening place to invest.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:45.940
Now the problem is that the most investor don't understand how things work or that there

00:00:45.940 --> 00:00:50.550
are many failures in dispersed among the success stories.

00:00:50.550 --> 00:00:54.590
The issue that fails don't make headlines,

00:00:54.590 --> 00:00:56.650
but there are many of them out there.

00:00:56.650 --> 00:01:00.140
In 2017 according to Bitcoin,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.250
a market general,

00:01:02.250 --> 00:01:10.190
35% off ice use open in 2017 did not report their funding statistics.

00:01:10.190 --> 00:01:13.730
While there might be several other figures at play,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:19.820
this is most likely an indication that they just did not meet their funding targets and did

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:25.420
not want to advertise the fact now coming onto the point which I took up,

00:01:25.420 --> 00:01:25.900
you know,

00:01:25.900 --> 00:01:28.050
in the beginning that do you know the components?

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:35.480
So to be considered successful and I seo must raise at least 75% off its funding target by

00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.960
selling its tokens.

00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:37.360
If,

00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:38.130
for example,

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:46.510
the company decides to issue one lack tokens and so some 6000 of these the issue would be

00:01:46.510 --> 00:01:47.980
considered successful.

00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:50.850
If this sold 72,000 how are they?

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:52.800
Were not so.

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:53.720
If the I c e.

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:54.070
O.

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:56.000
Does not bring in enough money,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.470
the chances of the company failing further down the line increased significantly.

00:02:01.470 --> 00:02:02.020
Ah,

00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:06.560
lack of working capital is something that causes many startups to fail.

00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:12.580
They cannot devote the resources to for furthering their idea or supporting the business

00:02:12.580 --> 00:02:17.320
while and I see your based company does not have a traditional structure,

00:02:17.320 --> 00:02:17.950
it is,

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.670
in a sense,

00:02:18.670 --> 00:02:23.750
a startup and so prone to do the same kind of issues that startup could have.

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:29.510
Problems with so many ice years will never reach their target funding and so are less

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:31.550
likely to compare successfully.

00:02:31.550 --> 00:02:32.310
Um,

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:34.850
there is something that you need to be aware off.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:40.720
Trims indicate that investors are becoming more discerning when it comes to I c e o

00:02:40.720 --> 00:02:46.050
investing opting more for the lower risk options than was that could fail.

00:02:46.050 --> 00:02:53.750
It seems that your typical investors appetite for risk is luring,

00:02:53.750 --> 00:03:00.260
meaning that I so have to do a lot of work to convince a potential investor to invest in

00:03:00.260 --> 00:03:01.350
the current climate.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:02.350
No,

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:06.960
but how will I get to know that Ah,

00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:11.730
which eyes here has Louris and which has more risk?

00:03:11.730 --> 00:03:13.880
How will I identify that?

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:19.300
So doing proper research is a key to understanding which I seals have a better chance of

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:24.410
succeeding That B is reading the white paper and researching the idea more.

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:24.980
Um,

00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.600
you know,

00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.550
there a lot of were true,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:28.820
though.

00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:35.050
And if you don't have time to read through pages and pages of I papers knowing what what

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:35.560
stays,

00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:40.720
the product that the ice you is producing is in can be a useful way.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:42.570
Tocar down your options.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:49.200
You will know instantly which to put on the slush pile because they don't match your

00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:50.650
appetite for risk.

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:54.280
Now the stage is coming onto stages,

00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:57.220
so there are four stages as you know.

00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:57.950
Ah,

00:03:57.950 --> 00:03:59.950
it has bean thought off.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:05.950
There are four stages of product development that you know you will see when looking into

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:07.940
ice you the first,

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:12.650
the idea stage during this face all you have to go on an idea.

00:04:12.650 --> 00:04:16.100
No one has get put any thought into their direction.

00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:20.150
Development might take or done a lot of market research,

00:04:20.150 --> 00:04:25.960
but the team may or may not have been put together yet At the stage,

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.730
the tokens are likely to,

00:04:27.730 --> 00:04:29.050
ah,

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:30.920
to be at the least expensive.

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:33.840
But the chances of it feeling are at the highest.

00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:39.050
And as I already served 70% off ice use actually a feeling,

00:04:39.050 --> 00:04:39.820
you know,

00:04:39.820 --> 00:04:42.020
I see who is in this stage are,

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:42.700
at best,

00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:46.120
risky investment or adverse a corn job.

00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.270
If you invest in this stage,

00:04:48.270 --> 00:04:52.370
you must be prepared to lose your whole investment off course.

00:04:52.370 --> 00:04:57.340
I'm not saying that you should never invest in a nice you a to the stage,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:00.380
but you should only do so when you're more experience.

00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:05.220
This is not a good investment for a big Noto make second point,

00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.150
the white paper state.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:15.520
So this is when the idea has moved out of the conception face and a lot more thought and

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:17.350
effort has been put into it.

00:05:17.350 --> 00:05:20.950
In the later lectures,

00:05:20.950 --> 00:05:24.580
we will look at what considers a good white paper at the stage.

00:05:24.580 --> 00:05:26.840
You have more than a simple idea,

00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:29.290
but you don't have a working product yet,

00:05:29.290 --> 00:05:32.450
so there is still some risk in world.

00:05:32.450 --> 00:05:35.850
They cannot solve the problem in the way they aim to.

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.550
There will be no return on your investment at all.

00:05:39.550 --> 00:05:40.350
No,

00:05:40.350 --> 00:05:45.890
this is the stairs that more most I CEOs you encounter will be at.

00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:51.310
You need to verify then that what they have said in the white paper is accurate.

00:05:51.310 --> 00:05:52.030
Third,

00:05:52.030 --> 00:05:55.030
the province development stayed there upper stage.

00:05:55.030 --> 00:05:56.700
This is where the developer,

00:05:56.700 --> 00:05:57.520
our company,

00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:59.950
have already created products.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:05.820
It may not be exactly the same as what they currently planning to work on,

00:06:05.820 --> 00:06:10.460
but it has a higher chance of success because the team has proven that they can do

00:06:10.460 --> 00:06:11.760
something similar.

00:06:11.760 --> 00:06:14.920
An example of this would be an icon or money.

00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:15.610
Let's say,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:16.410
for example,

00:06:16.410 --> 00:06:18.030
you are developed or developer.

00:06:18.030 --> 00:06:18.320
That,

00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:19.430
as previously really,

00:06:19.430 --> 00:06:23.190
is photo editing software that is in high demand.

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:26.710
Maybe now they have decided to add a scanning up.

00:06:26.710 --> 00:06:28.810
It's not exactly the same thing,

00:06:28.810 --> 00:06:35.150
but the developer get some leaving because of the proven ability in resting at the stage

00:06:35.150 --> 00:06:36.800
would be a little more expensive,

00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.650
but the chances off sexes are also much higher.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:42.680
Fourth stage.

00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.450
The prototype stage.

00:06:44.450 --> 00:06:46.750
This would be the most expense,

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:48.550
expensive time to invest.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:52.190
But it is also the time when your chances of sex is our highest.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:56.050
Now there is a working model off the product.

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:59.650
Yeah,

00:06:59.650 --> 00:07:01.750
that can be checked and tested.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:02.120
You know,

00:07:02.120 --> 00:07:04.020
the product work and how it works.

00:07:04.020 --> 00:07:07.150
The best example of this Is it a dream itself?

00:07:07.150 --> 00:07:14.470
The developer built the software first on tested it before having an ice.

00:07:14.470 --> 00:07:19.010
You This is a Louis risk option because this is no,

00:07:19.010 --> 00:07:19.790
You know,

00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.850
there is no question about whether or not the project is possible.

00:07:23.850 --> 00:07:24.860
You know,

00:07:24.860 --> 00:07:26.370
all that needs toe happen.

00:07:26.370 --> 00:07:29.130
It is that it is marketed correctly.

00:07:29.130 --> 00:07:31.420
You need to select the option.

00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:32.180
You know,

00:07:32.180 --> 00:07:39.560
that suits your investment profile the best.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:42.090
Are you okay with high risk investment,

00:07:42.090 --> 00:07:47.630
or do you want something that is a better chance of success for about spreading the risk a

00:07:47.630 --> 00:07:49.190
little and sore.

00:07:49.190 --> 00:07:54.660
So it's a good idea in any investment portfolio to consider what your short term and long

00:07:54.660 --> 00:07:55.850
term goals are.

00:07:55.850 --> 00:07:59.230
If you are retiring in two years time.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:04.160
It's a good idea to sink all your saving into Cryptocurrency investment.

00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:04.470
No,

00:08:04.470 --> 00:08:06.180
because if you lose it all,

00:08:06.180 --> 00:08:12.190
you have very little time to recover from the loss When deciding whether or not to invest.

00:08:12.190 --> 00:08:17.150
A good way of thinking is to determine when you will need the money.

00:08:17.150 --> 00:08:21.330
I saw investment are usually medium to long term investment,

00:08:21.330 --> 00:08:23.820
depending on how quickly the project,

00:08:23.820 --> 00:08:24.700
you know,

00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.620
takes off.

00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:26.680
So my advice.

00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.650
Use money that you won't need for at least next two years here and never use money that you

00:08:32.650 --> 00:08:34.270
can not afford to lose.

00:08:34.270 --> 00:08:37.790
Summarizing all the things in this lecture,

00:08:37.790 --> 00:08:38.450
you know,

00:08:38.450 --> 00:08:43.610
we have learned that many issues will fail their start up companies and so prone to the

00:08:43.610 --> 00:08:46.390
same kind of issues number one number do.

00:08:46.390 --> 00:08:47.480
That was successful.

00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.530
Eyes here is one that brings in atl East 3/4 of the expected amount.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:57.280
Capital is extremely important when it comes to product development.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:04.490
I'm number three that there are four stages when it comes to I c e o investing number five

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:04.490
.

00:09:04.490 --> 00:09:05.390
Number four.

00:09:05.390 --> 00:09:11.250
The highest risk of failure is doing the idea stage before much research has been done.

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:17.290
Number five The highest chance of success has been a working prototype is available for

00:09:17.290 --> 00:09:17.900
testing.

00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:18.900
So after all,

00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.120
the government work has been completed.

00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:26.040
Eso that completes our the summary ization.

00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:31.170
Now we will talk a few more things in the next set of lectures.

00:09:31.170 --> 00:09:32.370
For now,

00:09:32.370 --> 00:09:33.690
I'm taking a pause.

00:09:33.690 --> 00:09:36.650
Thank you very much for joining me here.
