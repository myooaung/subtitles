00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.930
Hey guys,

00:00:00.930 --> 00:00:04.210
let's talk more about what we left.

00:00:04.210 --> 00:00:06.200
You know in the last lecture,

00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:13.600
let's talk about smaller big supply and unlimited or high market capitalization.

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:17.050
So the outcome very hard to predict.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:23.310
You should be careful as unlimited or high market cap increases the factor of answer 10 ity

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:23.310
.

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:25.210
Every icy or team,

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:26.210
in my opinion,

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:29.450
should know where and how the funding is going to be used.

00:00:29.450 --> 00:00:30.710
For example,

00:00:30.710 --> 00:00:36.200
ban Caries 1 $50 million which shows that people believe in the technology.

00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.320
I'm also fairly positive that banker steam viewed.

00:00:40.320 --> 00:00:42.300
The result is extremely positive.

00:00:42.300 --> 00:00:45.050
But what about the I c E o investors?

00:00:45.050 --> 00:00:48.920
If you see the bankers supposed I see a performance.

00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:50.950
It's not looking good,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:51.700
you know,

00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.220
for early investment.

00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:54.810
You know,

00:00:54.810 --> 00:00:55.330
again,

00:00:55.330 --> 00:01:00.840
banker isn't necessarily a bad long term investment.

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:07.050
Just that buying the hype and getting on board at I C O Stage wasn't a good move.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:10.570
It was just too heavy to take off.

00:01:10.570 --> 00:01:16.450
And you should always dig into those reasons behind unlimited or high market caps.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:22.040
It is common to stay that all the unsold coins during icy will be born.

00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:24.350
It depends on the project and hype.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.880
It might happen that it might not happen,

00:01:26.880 --> 00:01:27.670
who knows?

00:01:27.670 --> 00:01:32.350
And the uncertainty remains if they reach the high card cap,

00:01:32.350 --> 00:01:34.230
what my investment makes sense.

00:01:34.230 --> 00:01:37.470
So that's the question you should probably ask.

00:01:37.470 --> 00:01:38.870
On the other hand,

00:01:38.870 --> 00:01:44.810
this means that they will never create any additional coins after the end off Icy O on.

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:45.880
This is a good thing.

00:01:45.880 --> 00:01:46.550
Why,

00:01:46.550 --> 00:01:47.610
you know.

00:01:47.610 --> 00:01:48.650
So the reason is,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.220
if you're going toe coin market cap dot com Right now,

00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:58.090
you will see that market caps for all the cryptocurrencies are displayed by the circulating

00:01:58.090 --> 00:01:58.750
supply.

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:02.150
This is an indicator off a present market gap.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:05.900
It doesn't show how the amount held by the project,

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:11.870
and it doesn't show you how many quiet's would enter in existence during the coming years.

00:02:11.870 --> 00:02:13.170
That is total supply.

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.460
In other words,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:17.870
it doesn't show you the progress of inflation,

00:02:17.870 --> 00:02:21.050
and that's something you should factored in as well.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:22.160
More offered.

00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:23.590
You are thinking this,

00:02:23.590 --> 00:02:24.560
you know,

00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.590
form the long or Tom angle.

00:02:26.590 --> 00:02:29.600
Don't understand me or get me wrong.

00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:31.570
There's nothing wrong with the inflation.

00:02:31.570 --> 00:02:34.410
It just that people usually don't consider it.

00:02:34.410 --> 00:02:39.990
So what are the things you should consider at the ice your stage as you can see on the

00:02:39.990 --> 00:02:40.590
screen.

00:02:40.590 --> 00:02:41.320
Ah,

00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.450
1st 1 would be Is there a hard copy?

00:02:43.450 --> 00:02:45.160
Second words A total supply,

00:02:45.160 --> 00:02:49.270
the price per coin and forth compared with the market.

00:02:49.270 --> 00:02:52.690
So if I talk about other,

00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.320
there are more to consider than just I see oh,

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.510
market caps.

00:02:56.510 --> 00:03:02.640
Just to clarify the information presented in this lecture is not sufficient for making

00:03:02.640 --> 00:03:04.160
calculated decision.

00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:10.510
You should most definitely considered business perspective and other indicators.

00:03:10.510 --> 00:03:16.690
But dismantling this beast would require us separate set off lectures off course.

00:03:16.690 --> 00:03:23.850
So making sure to understand what they are trying to achieve is the first thing to do as

00:03:23.850 --> 00:03:28.170
every good hanger doesn't belong to the Blockchain.

00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:35.030
So let's start from the simple read The white paper doesn't feel seem professional,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:35.520
Do you?

00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:38.230
Is the quality of easy presentable.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:39.430
Do they have Ah,

00:03:39.430 --> 00:03:42.610
working product or a very tested prototype?

00:03:42.610 --> 00:03:44.500
Is the idea understand?

00:03:44.500 --> 00:03:46.610
The ballon simply explainable.

00:03:46.610 --> 00:03:48.480
Who is behind the project?

00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:50.390
What have they done before?

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:51.850
Is that a market?

00:03:51.850 --> 00:03:55.210
What on the use cases Partnership law?

00:03:55.210 --> 00:03:56.480
Last results,

00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:57.450
etcetera.

00:03:57.450 --> 00:04:00.780
You have every right to ask hard,

00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:01.050
um,

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.860
repetitive question before throwing your money at it.

00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:07.050
Don't buy the hype yourself.

00:04:07.050 --> 00:04:09.480
Always do your own due diligence.

00:04:09.480 --> 00:04:13.680
There are bounty campaign for most ice CEOs,

00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:16.430
and people are getting paid to write article,

00:04:16.430 --> 00:04:20.340
post on social media and so forth again,

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.840
This is not necessarily a bad thing.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:24.850
Just keep your mind alert.

00:04:24.850 --> 00:04:30.750
Simplicity and transparency are the keywords to an interesting I c e o.

00:04:30.750 --> 00:04:34.120
If something is overly complicated,

00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:37.070
it's probably best to stay away from it.

00:04:37.070 --> 00:04:45.240
The objective off this lecture was not to play through every possible icy oh scenario and

00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:47.350
determine the right from wrong.

00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.760
But just to give you perspective,

00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.010
that should behaviour,

00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:51.750
we add.

00:04:51.750 --> 00:04:54.200
So I'm sure you know,

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:55.800
this would really,

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:56.290
you know,

00:04:56.290 --> 00:04:58.560
help a czar guidance.

00:04:58.560 --> 00:04:59.050
You know,

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.890
in choosing I CEOs with that,

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.370
I'm taking a pause here.

00:05:03.370 --> 00:05:03.910
I would,

00:05:03.910 --> 00:05:04.650
uh,

00:05:04.650 --> 00:05:05.100
you know,

00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.490
I would resume again in the next lecture till then.

00:05:08.490 --> 00:05:09.030
You know,

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:10.160
I'm just taking a leap.

00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.350
Thank you very much.
