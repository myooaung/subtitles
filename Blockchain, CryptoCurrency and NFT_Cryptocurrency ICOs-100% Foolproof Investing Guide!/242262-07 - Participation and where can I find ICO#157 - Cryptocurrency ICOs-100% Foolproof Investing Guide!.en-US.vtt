00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.490
Hello,

00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:00.970
guys.

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:07.860
Let's quickly talk about how to participate and ice you now to participate denies you.

00:00:07.860 --> 00:00:10.070
We have to follow the falling steps.

00:00:10.070 --> 00:00:10.710
Number one,

00:00:10.710 --> 00:00:13.850
get some kryptos registered with one exchange,

00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:20.730
for example Coinbase which will actually make you receive $10 worth of free Bitcoin and by

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:21.660
some kryptos.

00:00:21.660 --> 00:00:22.640
Most likely,

00:00:22.640 --> 00:00:29.520
you will leave your Deitsch number to register your valid registered your valid um,

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.150
I eat are valid is highly rated valid.

00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.040
Thanks to the excellent user interface,

00:00:35.040 --> 00:00:38.820
transfer your coins from exchange to your valid.

00:00:38.820 --> 00:00:40.620
Even if you don't participate,

00:00:40.620 --> 00:00:48.910
you should still do it as its large Safer than keeping your kryptos to an exchange point

00:00:48.910 --> 00:00:49.500
number three.

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.450
Read the I c o instruction.

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.870
If you have joined the company's slack or any other communication channel,

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:57.310
then you won't miss it.

00:00:57.310 --> 00:00:59.480
If you haven't most likely,

00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:01.580
you will need to do some research.

00:01:01.580 --> 00:01:04.170
Any who The team behind ice.

00:01:04.170 --> 00:01:08.680
You will publish instruction some days before the ice your takes place.

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:09.940
Read it carefully.

00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:10.940
Additionally,

00:01:10.940 --> 00:01:15.950
read the general term off the issue and the token purchase agreement.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.700
Number four followed the instructions.

00:01:18.700 --> 00:01:21.360
Do everything as said in the instruction,

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:23.370
or you will lose your investment,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:28.400
you will need to send it th toe the address specified in the instructions.

00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.160
You also need to set up proper guests.

00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.130
Limit now.

00:01:32.130 --> 00:01:33.660
Very talk about gas limit.

00:01:33.660 --> 00:01:36.900
Let's quickly talk about what is guess limit.

00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.070
Now here is an explanation from my Eater Valid website.

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:47.160
The gas limit is called the Liberty because it's the maximum amount of units of gas you are

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.540
willing to spend on a transaction.

00:01:49.540 --> 00:01:56.590
This award situation where there isn't enter somewhere in the contract and you spend one of

00:01:56.590 --> 00:02:01.650
the edge Tenet th 1000 GT is going in circles but arriving nowhere.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:02.980
However,

00:02:02.980 --> 00:02:09.990
the units of guests necessary for a transaction are already defined by how much good is

00:02:09.990 --> 00:02:12.250
excluded on the Blockchain.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:15.250
If you do not want to spend as much on gas,

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:18.080
luring the gas limit won't help much.

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:23.920
You must include enough gas toe cover The computational resource you use all your

00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:27.650
transaction will feel beautiful and out of guests error.

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:33.570
All a news guests is refunded to you at the end of her transaction.

00:02:33.570 --> 00:02:35.900
So if you go to my eater valid,

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:42.220
send one idiot throughout donation address and he was a gas limit off,

00:02:42.220 --> 00:02:50.400
say 400 k You will receive 400 gay for 400 k 21,000 gave back.

00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:51.400
However,

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:57.080
if you are sent If you were sending one e th toe a contract and your transaction toe the

00:02:57.080 --> 00:03:02.690
contract fails Say the token creation period is already over.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:07.340
You will use the entire 400 k and receive nothing back.

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:13.790
So 21 k orderly 1000 is aghast limit for standard transaction.

00:03:13.790 --> 00:03:18.460
We knew sandy area th There are different scenario of what might happen.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:25.560
You will receive your token immediately after the token sale and or you have to relieve

00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:27.030
your tokens manually.

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:27.780
Third,

00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.850
you have to wait furies for your tokens.

00:03:30.850 --> 00:03:34.600
Now a word of caution There is to be very careful.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.350
These are hackers.

00:03:36.350 --> 00:03:42.970
There are hackers that might try to change an address often eyes you address for example,

00:03:42.970 --> 00:03:45.530
by changing the website off dies your team.

00:03:45.530 --> 00:03:52.390
This happened in the past Now the next most important question is Ah,

00:03:52.390 --> 00:03:54.850
where can I find I see those.

00:03:54.850 --> 00:03:58.120
So where can I find ice use?

00:03:58.120 --> 00:03:59.580
The answer is you know,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:07.180
if we go to different website that lists in the upcoming ice use such as a token market

00:04:07.180 --> 00:04:07.710
queen.

00:04:07.710 --> 00:04:11.750
She buell ice your timeline and I see your tracker,

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:15.290
as you can see on the screen and the final one.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.200
I seo countdown as well.

00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:22.450
So never getting through icy or market caps can be done in the following day.

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.730
What are the ice,

00:04:23.730 --> 00:04:26.980
your market caps and how to make calculator decision?

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:32.250
There's always someone on a ratted claiming 1000 profit in any given month.

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:34.750
Are the old spammers scammers,

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:36.770
bounty hunters?

00:04:36.770 --> 00:04:38.410
Or it is really possible?

00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:39.250
Yes,

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:43.050
you have to find out about the team and read the Almighty,

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:44.060
you know,

00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:44.410
white,

00:04:44.410 --> 00:04:46.230
black and yellow papers.

00:04:46.230 --> 00:04:48.910
When you start getting into it more deeply,

00:04:48.910 --> 00:04:58.700
you will hope to make any sense out off those 22,000 or 20 toe 1000 K post and 700 K plus

00:04:58.700 --> 00:05:00.550
tropics on Bitcoin talk.

00:05:00.550 --> 00:05:03.560
And here we go again,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:06.070
Another editor claiming monthly profit.

00:05:06.070 --> 00:05:13.990
He could barely believe himself the posters off awarded by other registers claiming to be

00:05:13.990 --> 00:05:15.520
making the same return.

00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.280
Plus,

00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.530
they are generating even healthier return from other project.

00:05:20.530 --> 00:05:22.140
Is this really happening,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:24.060
or am I being brainwashed?

00:05:24.060 --> 00:05:28.550
Every project I Google seems to be the best ice you ever.

00:05:28.550 --> 00:05:32.260
So where to begin.

00:05:32.260 --> 00:05:34.400
And where should I point my money gun?

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:35.150
No,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:36.960
that's a different,

00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.570
difficult question.

00:05:38.570 --> 00:05:42.620
But let's first talk about different perspective on ice use,

00:05:42.620 --> 00:05:45.710
as many Cryptocurrency intra Chest have said,

00:05:45.710 --> 00:05:51.100
most issues are not their own in few years time consent.

00:05:51.100 --> 00:05:53.580
Considering the progression off the industy,

00:05:53.580 --> 00:05:59.400
it is hard to argue many of the current top kryptos will be vibe doubt by the only

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:00.760
tightening competition,

00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:02.010
and this is critical.

00:06:02.010 --> 00:06:03.310
In order to reversal,

00:06:03.310 --> 00:06:03.910
revel,

00:06:03.910 --> 00:06:11.780
revolutionize the financial system we need them to fill as Andrea as or art in a Paula's

00:06:11.780 --> 00:06:19.630
has said Rees and repeat investor mature in time and not getting involved in garbage coins

00:06:19.630 --> 00:06:23.380
eventually make room for true a revolution,

00:06:23.380 --> 00:06:24.340
however,

00:06:24.340 --> 00:06:27.770
and this is only my personal interpret interpretation off.

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:31.110
The current situation is that within the maturing period,

00:06:31.110 --> 00:06:32.390
there are us,

00:06:32.390 --> 00:06:35.850
the traders investor who can benefit from the crease.

00:06:35.850 --> 00:06:38.060
People are wondering,

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.270
Why the hell would anyone want to invest something toe the ice?

00:06:41.270 --> 00:06:44.350
Your crazy wild beauty sees breaking all time high.

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:45.840
Well,

00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:46.980
the reason is simple.

00:06:46.980 --> 00:06:50.900
If one Bitcoin cost 100 k tomorrow,

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:58.070
it would be 80 in foregin from $5500.200 games USD.

00:06:58.070 --> 00:07:00.770
Let's put that into fairly random.

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:07.910
I see a perspective WDC from September 1st to October 1st 30 day period,

00:07:07.910 --> 00:07:11.090
we went from $0.5 toe,

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:13.340
$8.5 in 30 days.

00:07:13.340 --> 00:07:14.850
That's a 17 4 game.

00:07:14.850 --> 00:07:18.110
But do V c but going reaching these heights any time,

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.470
so I don't.

00:07:19.470 --> 00:07:22.800
So do we see more icy or providing similar written?

00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:23.680
Very likely.

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:27.550
And that's why many of us are in the I C o business.

00:07:27.550 --> 00:07:29.800
Okay,

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:30.830
so with this,

00:07:30.830 --> 00:07:32.240
I'm taking a pause here.

00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.950
And in the next lecture,

00:07:33.950 --> 00:07:39.720
I would be talking about a few more interesting aspect off I seal and Bitcoin.

00:07:39.720 --> 00:07:40.200
Thank you.
