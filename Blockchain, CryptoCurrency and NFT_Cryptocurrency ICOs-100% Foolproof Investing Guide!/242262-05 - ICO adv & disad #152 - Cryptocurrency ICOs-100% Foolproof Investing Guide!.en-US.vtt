00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.480
Hey,

00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:00.970
guys,

00:00:00.970 --> 00:00:04.750
let's discuss about the advantages and disadvantages off.

00:00:04.750 --> 00:00:05.520
Ah,

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:06.850
investing in I sealed.

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:11.070
So you will learn.

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:11.450
I mean,

00:00:11.450 --> 00:00:14.950
we will be discussing more in this lecture,

00:00:14.950 --> 00:00:20.560
and you learn what the advantages and pitfalls are when it comes to investing in ice use

00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:24.150
and also the difference between I CEO and I Peel.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:29.730
People have been quick to jump on the bandwagon when it comes to investing in i CEOs.

00:00:29.730 --> 00:00:31.160
Who can blame them?

00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:31.830
After all,

00:00:31.830 --> 00:00:34.450
that has been so much buzz about Bitcoin,

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:41.850
and it's metaphoric increase in value that no one wants to miss out in the next big thing.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:47.430
So it it's led to a flood off investment in this arena.

00:00:47.430 --> 00:00:47.720
This,

00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:48.250
in turn,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.950
has led to the influx off a new companies hoping to get a piece off that investment money.

00:00:53.950 --> 00:00:55.140
There is,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:55.710
however,

00:00:55.710 --> 00:01:00.350
a difference between not wanting to miss out and being a savvy investor.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:06.220
Let's start by looking at the want ages and disadvantages off investing in ice.

00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:06.450
You.

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:09.130
Let's start with advantages first,

00:01:09.130 --> 00:01:13.130
so they helped vote while projects get off the ground ah,

00:01:13.130 --> 00:01:17.350
lot faster by allowing them to raise forms in a non traditional way,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:23.190
getting start up money in the traditional sphere can be somewhat difficult to accomplish,

00:01:23.190 --> 00:01:29.450
with the conventional investors wanting companies to jump through some serious hoops,

00:01:29.450 --> 00:01:34.050
so investor get to come in at the very best possible price.

00:01:34.050 --> 00:01:39.320
The initial coin offering is bound to be the Louis price for those tokens,

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:45.530
and Investor can take at one stage of this they have assessed to investing before the

00:01:45.530 --> 00:01:47.000
project even starts.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.090
This allows for the maximum potential for growth of the company.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:53.310
Succeeds off course,

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:54.360
one important point,

00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:57.150
and at one day there's no bureaucracy to get around.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:04.320
Think off all the red tape you would have to overcome if you are if you were to try and

00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:07.120
start up a motivational company.

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.030
In many cases,

00:02:08.030 --> 00:02:13.350
companies never make it off the ground because off all the red tape that they have to wait

00:02:13.350 --> 00:02:14.940
through with ice use,

00:02:14.940 --> 00:02:15.710
however,

00:02:15.710 --> 00:02:18.860
the developer and the investor can interact directly.

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.430
There's no intermediate tree that must be satisfied.

00:02:22.430 --> 00:02:23.050
First,

00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:25.950
all the developer needs a good idea,

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.760
a velvet and white paper and a good marketing.

00:02:30.760 --> 00:02:32.200
From then on,

00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:35.280
it's up to the investor to invest it or not,

00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:40.260
Developers can see whether or not there is a good grounding for the product without

00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:42.910
spending too much money after all.

00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:43.400
Ah,

00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:45.810
if the icy or doesn't pan out,

00:02:45.810 --> 00:02:49.550
it sends indication that the team is doing something wrong.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.920
At present,

00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:53.460
there are few regulation governing this fear,

00:02:53.460 --> 00:02:57.250
and this makes it easier for both the investor and the level upper,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:03:00.550
though that seems set to change quickly.

00:03:00.550 --> 00:03:01.470
Well,

00:03:01.470 --> 00:03:02.720
the advice here is,

00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:08.050
especially if you are in the countries like United States to read upon security laws.

00:03:08.050 --> 00:03:11.620
We will go into this in more detail later,

00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:15.980
but it is better to applause the investment as if it was a security and follow the

00:03:15.980 --> 00:03:18.830
regulation in this regard as closely as possible,

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.580
and not only us,

00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:22.250
but in other countries as well.

00:03:22.250 --> 00:03:26.470
They don't tend to follow a typical corporate structure,

00:03:26.470 --> 00:03:31.650
enabling them to be away with extraneous stuff that are not really necessary.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:37.050
So the startup is able to save money on staffing and use it varied really counts.

00:03:37.050 --> 00:03:38.500
Let's get started.

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.800
Were disadvantages.

00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.450
Okay,

00:03:40.450 --> 00:03:45.590
the same lack of regulation that can be blown for Ah,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:49.900
what while projects also creates a free zone for people out to scam,

00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:51.770
you don't fool yourself.

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:54.070
There are a lot of scams in the icy a word,

00:03:54.070 --> 00:03:56.320
and once you have sent them the money,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:59.050
there's little to no chance of recovering it.

00:03:59.050 --> 00:04:00.660
Fortunately,

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:05.450
most camps are pretty easy to recognize when you know what to look far,

00:04:05.450 --> 00:04:07.310
this is speculation.

00:04:07.310 --> 00:04:08.350
At its best.

00:04:08.350 --> 00:04:12.450
You are putting your money behind an idea that might or might not work.

00:04:12.450 --> 00:04:15.630
You will know how to look out for scams,

00:04:15.630 --> 00:04:17.300
and that will protect your little.

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.420
That doesn't mean that you won't lose your money if the idea tanks or the developer is a

00:04:23.420 --> 00:04:24.350
nipple toe.

00:04:24.350 --> 00:04:26.680
Yeah,

00:04:26.680 --> 00:04:29.200
the Doubler developer is unable to,

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:30.050
ah,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:33.950
bring it toe flotation.

00:04:33.950 --> 00:04:37.950
Your money is pretty much gone because the token will lose their value.

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:41.350
The other reason is the regulators are coming.

00:04:41.350 --> 00:04:46.440
Regulation is something what that works against the intent of Blockchain technology.

00:04:46.440 --> 00:04:52.630
One of the significant advantages of the Blockchain is that there is no central authority

00:04:52.630 --> 00:04:55.180
to censor or tell it how to run.

00:04:55.180 --> 00:04:57.440
But in the investment arena,

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.850
investors do need some form of protection.

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:05.710
Now let's talk about initial coin offering,

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:07.830
ever says initial public offering,

00:05:07.830 --> 00:05:10.450
which is I see over says I peel.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:16.670
If you're looking for a more traditionally investment part initial public offering are no

00:05:16.670 --> 00:05:21.690
doubt something you are looked in tow onto the surface.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:23.920
Both investment seems to be seen,

00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:25.350
but they are very different.

00:05:25.350 --> 00:05:29.520
Both are used to raise capital for development or expansion,

00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:31.950
and I CEOs are based on the i p O model.

00:05:31.950 --> 00:05:38.680
But that's about where the similarities and with I suppose you invest by exchanging talking

00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:40.760
for a more established Cryptocurrency.

00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:42.150
Like either or Bitcoin,

00:05:42.150 --> 00:05:46.930
you are assigned the rights that the company decides to give you.

00:05:46.930 --> 00:05:52.190
There are no automatically assigned rights I like with AIPO,

00:05:52.190 --> 00:05:58.150
you do not automatically become a shareholder and so usually do right have the same.

00:05:58.150 --> 00:05:59.450
The running of the company.

00:05:59.450 --> 00:06:04.660
Being a token holder will not entitle you to have a look at the finances either,

00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:07.950
so it is much more hands off type of investment.

00:06:07.950 --> 00:06:08.760
Well,

00:06:08.760 --> 00:06:14.370
there are cases where isil do offer wording rights or allowed contribution from investors,

00:06:14.370 --> 00:06:20.020
but you are more likely to have a pay have to pay a premium for these and these cases,

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:21.180
at exception was,

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:27.980
is the rule people buy I CEOs because they either believe that the project is a good one

00:06:27.980 --> 00:06:33.880
and want to show support or they want to get a good return on the investment on most time.

00:06:33.880 --> 00:06:35.210
It's little of both.

00:06:35.210 --> 00:06:38.510
I pills are also about raising funds,

00:06:38.510 --> 00:06:41.150
usually to help the companies grow more quickly.

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:46.330
But here you are buying shares in the business as a shared ho shareholder,

00:06:46.330 --> 00:06:51.070
you will have some sort of saying how the company's run and are entitled to see the

00:06:51.070 --> 00:06:52.950
financial statement of the company.

00:06:52.950 --> 00:06:55.730
I see those are part of the free market.

00:06:55.730 --> 00:06:58.380
This means that they are mostly under regulated.

00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:01.380
They can get away with selling Justin idea.

00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:04.680
If you invest in them and the project doesn't take off,

00:07:04.680 --> 00:07:07.110
you have no legal recourse against them.

00:07:07.110 --> 00:07:10.720
That's the trade off for potentially potential.

00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.870
Massive return is the same with any investment.

00:07:13.870 --> 00:07:14.790
The higher there is,

00:07:14.790 --> 00:07:17.310
the higher the reward with I pose.

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:18.170
On the other hand,

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:24.460
there are a lot of more regulation in place to protect Shareholder's order to become a

00:07:24.460 --> 00:07:25.860
publicly listed company.

00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:27.860
The company must are there to these rules.

00:07:27.860 --> 00:07:28.560
This intrudes,

00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:33.400
releasing an old financial statement that have Bean independently ordered.

00:07:33.400 --> 00:07:34.960
Setting up an I.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:35.140
P.

00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:41.600
O is a lot more difficult than setting upon I seal and that's why don't they take advantage

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:46.050
and choose And I seo having said that dough more regulations are on the cards,

00:07:46.050 --> 00:07:49.450
so the gap between I peer nice you is narrowing all the time.

00:07:49.450 --> 00:07:54.680
Taxation of the two options is handled in a little differently.

00:07:54.680 --> 00:07:56.180
If you invest in NY,

00:07:56.180 --> 00:07:59.250
pure profit might be subject to capital gains tax.

00:07:59.250 --> 00:08:00.170
Technically,

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.390
the same is true if you invest in a lie CEO.

00:08:02.390 --> 00:08:09.080
But presently there is no legislation that deals specifically with Cryptocurrencies again,

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.230
that is something that is bound to change.

00:08:11.230 --> 00:08:16.940
Uncle Sam and other government worldwide are actively looking for ways to monitor and tax

00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:18.650
Cryptocurrency exchanges.

00:08:18.650 --> 00:08:21.380
They also want their piece of the action.

00:08:21.380 --> 00:08:26.830
The final difference between the two is that I pose are forced to follow a more rigid

00:08:26.830 --> 00:08:30.210
traditional structure in westerns.

00:08:30.210 --> 00:08:33.820
Want to see that there is a CF or board of director etcetera?

00:08:33.820 --> 00:08:37.380
I CEOs follow much less rigid corporate structure,

00:08:37.380 --> 00:08:42.220
often only sticking to the core stuff needed for the project and no one else.

00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:47.580
This increasing increases the flexibility of the organization and can help to reduce

00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:48.330
overhead.

00:08:48.330 --> 00:08:51.740
But it bite also work against that.

00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:56.370
I see you if they don't have the right expertise at their disposal.

00:08:56.370 --> 00:08:59.250
Now if we have to summarize it.

00:08:59.250 --> 00:09:03.350
We learned a couple of things about I C E O.

00:09:03.350 --> 00:09:09.370
That there are some attractive advantages to icy investment that these advantages typically

00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:12.600
stem from the fact that I see is our more loosely structured,

00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.890
easier to get off the ground and less highly regulated.

00:09:15.890 --> 00:09:17.320
Third,

00:09:17.320 --> 00:09:22.730
they make it possible for those who need funding toe get their idea out to investor in a

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:25.250
straightforward manner so that both can benefit.

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:31.080
I see was Allow investor to invest early on,

00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:34.150
thereby maximizing the potential return on investment.

00:09:34.150 --> 00:09:37.260
The idea for ice you is derived from my people.

00:09:37.260 --> 00:09:42.500
But there do our These two are very different from one another.

00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.140
Both ice you and I PR used to raise money.

00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:46.830
Buying into a nice here,

00:09:46.830 --> 00:09:47.150
however,

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:48.940
is not likely to get you,

00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:53.170
Wording writes in the company Toe access financial statements,

00:09:53.170 --> 00:09:58.910
the primary difference between ice and I piers that the later are a lot more heavily

00:09:58.910 --> 00:10:00.520
regulated and more efficiently.

00:10:00.520 --> 00:10:06.250
Text indications are that Isil will move closer to the I p O model in terms of regulation

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:10.620
and taxation in the coming few months.

00:10:10.620 --> 00:10:13.310
so that you know,

00:10:13.310 --> 00:10:14.670
I'm just ending this.

00:10:14.670 --> 00:10:16.610
You know this chapter,

00:10:16.610 --> 00:10:17.900
this lecture.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:19.280
In the next lecture,

00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:22.900
we would discuss a few more interesting aspects of ice.

00:10:22.900 --> 00:10:24.110
You tell them.

00:10:24.110 --> 00:10:25.350
Take care.

00:10:25.350 --> 00:10:26.650
Thank you very much.
