00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.570
Hey,

00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:00.940
guys,

00:00:00.940 --> 00:00:01.760
welcome again.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.800
Let's talk about any shell coin off free.

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:11.160
Slightly now Detail lower definition off initial going offering,

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:18.550
say's an unknown regulated means by which farms are raised for a new Cryptocurrency venture

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:18.550
.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:26.130
An initial coin offering is used by start ups to by pass the rigorous and regulated capital

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:33.390
raising process required by venture capitalists are banks in an icy oh campaign.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:39.760
A percentage of the Cryptocurrency is sore toe early backers off the project in exchange

00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:42.890
for legal tender or other cryptocurrencies,

00:00:42.890 --> 00:00:45.060
but usually for Bitcoin.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:49.280
It is also called as an initial public coin offering,

00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:52.350
which is I PCO okay,

00:00:52.350 --> 00:00:57.890
breaking down initial coin offering slightly at a granular level.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:00:58.950
Then,

00:00:58.950 --> 00:01:04.850
when a Cryptocurrency startup phone wants to raise money through an initial coin offering,

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:08.870
it usually creates a plan on a white paper which states were.

00:01:08.870 --> 00:01:13.370
The project is about what need the project will fulfill upon completion.

00:01:13.370 --> 00:01:16.300
How much money is needed to undertake the venture.

00:01:16.300 --> 00:01:20.560
How much of the virtual tokens the by only is off.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:26.340
The project will keep for themselves what type of monies accepted and how long the I Seo

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:33.420
campaign will run for during the Isil campaign into zest and supporters of the farm

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:39.950
initiative by some off the distributed crypto coins with fear or virtual currency.

00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:45.010
These coins are referred to as tokens and are similar to shares.

00:01:45.010 --> 00:01:50.690
Offer companies sold to investors in a AIPO initial public offering transaction.

00:01:50.690 --> 00:01:51.530
Now,

00:01:51.530 --> 00:01:55.940
if the money raised does not meet the minimum funds required by the farm,

00:01:55.940 --> 00:02:01.210
the money is returned to the backers and ice you is deemed to be unsuccessful.

00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:05.920
If the forms requirement are matter within the specified time frame,

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:08.120
the money raises usedto either.

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:09.560
In he shared the news came,

00:02:09.560 --> 00:02:11.000
Are took completed.

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.350
Okay.

00:02:12.350 --> 00:02:18.830
Early investor in the operation are usually motivated toe by the crypto coin in the hope

00:02:18.830 --> 00:02:23.740
that the plan becomes successful and after it launches,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.630
which could translate and took her to a higher crypto coin value.

00:02:27.630 --> 00:02:28.680
Then what?

00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:33.920
They purchased it for ah before the project was initiated,

00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:40.610
an example off a successful IDEO project that was profitable too early Investor is the

00:02:40.610 --> 00:02:44.220
smart contracts platform called Ethereum,

00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:49.090
which is eaters as its coin tokens.

00:02:49.090 --> 00:02:57.640
In 2014 the Italian project was announced and its icy or raised 18 million in Bitcoins,

00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:02.350
or $0.40 per eater.

00:03:02.350 --> 00:03:12.890
The project went live in 2015 on 2016 had an eater value what van upto as high as $14 with

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:17.070
a market capitalization off over one billion.

00:03:17.070 --> 00:03:23.210
Now I CEOs are similar toe I pose and crowdfunding,

00:03:23.210 --> 00:03:29.680
like I pose a steak off the startup are completely sold to raise money for the entity

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.380
operations during an icy operations.

00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:33.550
However,

00:03:33.550 --> 00:03:40.360
while I pure deal with investor I CEOs deal with supporters that our kid to invest in a new

00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.980
project much like a crowdfunding even.

00:03:42.980 --> 00:03:46.430
But I see her differ from crowdfunding in.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:52.150
The backers of the former are motivated by prospectively return in their investments,

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:57.510
while the fundraise in the later come campaign are basically donation.

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:59.390
For these reasons,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:01.390
I CEOs are referred.

00:04:01.390 --> 00:04:05.610
Do as crowd sales now,

00:04:05.610 --> 00:04:07.190
although they're successful,

00:04:07.190 --> 00:04:09.080
ice your transaction on record,

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:12.260
and I see those are poised to be disruptive,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:14.640
innovative tool in the digital era,

00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:16.530
investors are caution.

00:04:16.530 --> 00:04:17.050
Toby,

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:23.790
very as some eyes your crowd sales campaign are actually fraudulent because these

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.660
fundraising operatives are not regulated by financial authorities.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:35.800
Such a security exchange commission firms that our laws do toe fertile and initiatives may

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.000
never be recovered,

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.930
so we need to be very cautious,

00:04:38.930 --> 00:04:39.350
you know,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:42.380
and dealing with it now.

00:04:42.380 --> 00:04:49.400
In early September 2017 the People Bank of China officially banned I CEOs,

00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.750
citing it as disruptive toe economic and financial stability.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:05:03.080
The central bank said Tokens cannot be used as currency on the market and banks cannot

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:06.580
offer services relating toe icy use.

00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:07.670
As a result,

00:05:07.670 --> 00:05:16.060
both Bitcoin and Ethereum Stumpel tumbled and it was viewed as a sign that regulation off

00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:17.950
cryptocurrencies are coming.

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:23.720
The ban also penalizes offering already completed.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.590
Okay,

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:32.890
now we will talk more in detail in the next lecture.

00:05:32.890 --> 00:05:37.850
Here we are taking a pause and we will talk more Ah,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.530
in detail about this.

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:43.050
So tell them thank you very much.
