00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340
now that we have a basic understanding off how Redux applications work that has combined

00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:07.350
the Redux Onda react together.

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:08.630
For this,

00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:10.250
I have a demo application,

00:00:10.250 --> 00:00:11.640
which has couple of components.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:13.830
Number one is the add new contact here,

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:16.760
which is a contact form component on on the right side,

00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:19.200
there is a component currently not displaying anything,

00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.550
which is the contact list component that's going to have a look at the source score.

00:00:23.550 --> 00:00:26.220
Here we have the index Georgie S,

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:33.390
which is creating a component called up that just Retton's do with a container class that

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:34.110
they're heading.

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.440
And then there is a road with two columns.

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:41.710
The column one displays the contact form column two is displaying the contact list.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.480
If you go to the contact form,

00:00:43.480 --> 00:00:46.330
the contact form has estate with name,

00:00:46.330 --> 00:00:46.650
email,

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.830
phone and picture.

00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:49.790
They're than ever validation.

00:00:49.790 --> 00:00:52.690
This is the same contact form that we have used in the past,

00:00:52.690 --> 00:00:54.790
and when you click on the submit button,

00:00:54.790 --> 00:00:57.220
this is a function that's going to be executed.

00:00:57.220 --> 00:01:02.420
Submit handler where we are doing all the validations and if everything is OK,

00:01:02.420 --> 00:01:05.300
we are creating a new contact object,

00:01:05.300 --> 00:01:10.700
and this is where we have to call the Are contact function such that the contact object

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:14.870
will now be part of the store and the store will update the view.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:15.660
After that,

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.560
we have just resetting the state so that the textbooks becomes empty and nothing else.

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:23.370
So if you go to the contact list component,

00:01:23.370 --> 00:01:26.320
it is a class based component.

00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.860
Not that we have a state or anything here,

00:01:28.860 --> 00:01:32.110
but eventually we're gonna have something like a lifecycle function.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:33.150
Father.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:36.390
I'm using the contact list as a class based component.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:43.200
The Render function is looking for the contacts in the props and the props.

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:45.240
If the context is not there,

00:01:45.240 --> 00:01:48.110
it's going to have an empty list,

00:01:48.110 --> 00:01:49.670
and that's what we're seeing currently.

00:01:49.670 --> 00:01:53.160
But if the contacts is in a way in the props,

00:01:53.160 --> 00:01:57.150
then we're actually converting that list into a A list.

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.150
Off contact cards and the contact are simply displace the picture of the contact.

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:04.290
Probably the name.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:05.850
There is a button for the leading,

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:07.690
not doing the actual deal adoption.

00:02:07.690 --> 00:02:09.700
But there is a scope for that.

00:02:09.700 --> 00:02:13.840
And then some data like email and four as off.

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:14.220
No,

00:02:14.220 --> 00:02:19.600
there is no data propagated from my props here If I had some data,

00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.020
then probably it would be destroyed as well.

00:02:22.020 --> 00:02:28.040
The idea here is that the state management is removed from the unusual component and is

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.720
going to be part of the reader store Before we proceed with the readers.

00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.570
Let's go back to the browser on search for this Redux Death tolls Chrome extension.

00:02:38.570 --> 00:02:44.020
You will see the very 1st 1 when you opened that it will ask you toe act to your chrome.

00:02:44.020 --> 00:02:44.980
In my case,

00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:47.750
I already have Search simply says removed from groom.

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:53.820
What it does is it gives us a extension here safe about the view developer.

00:02:53.820 --> 00:02:55.850
And if you go to the developer tools,

00:02:55.850 --> 00:03:00.500
you can see that I do have a new data here for readers.

00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.860
And right now it says no store form.

00:03:02.860 --> 00:03:04.720
Make sure to follow the instructions.

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.470
Of course,

00:03:05.470 --> 00:03:10.730
I'm gonna show you the steps to be followed so that this relax debit tools can help us

00:03:10.730 --> 00:03:12.070
understand how this works.

00:03:12.070 --> 00:03:17.750
One very important point to remember is that your application should not communicate with

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:19.780
this extension in the production.

00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.250
So let's close this.

00:03:21.250 --> 00:03:23.430
Go back to the source score.

00:03:23.430 --> 00:03:27.850
We will not do some basic installations required for our application.

00:03:27.850 --> 00:03:30.550
First weird install couple of packages.

00:03:30.550 --> 00:03:36.660
Let's go toe view menu and then say terminal with the N B.

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:36.990
M.

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.200
I read books.

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.150
React really looks.

00:03:40.150 --> 00:03:45.850
Then we're gonna use something called Relax Their tools extension.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:52.520
This is the one that helps us communicate with the actual extension on the Google chrome.

00:03:52.520 --> 00:03:53.960
And apart from that,

00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:55.270
we need one more card.

00:03:55.270 --> 00:03:55.990
Relax,

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:59.950
Tongue will talk about this as we go forward and press.

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:02.350
Enter this medic a couple of minutes.

00:04:02.350 --> 00:04:06.570
Let's close this and like in the previous example,

00:04:06.570 --> 00:04:08.690
we have to create a store.

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.010
That store depends on one or more.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.060
Producers on the reduces make use off actions.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:21.850
So let's go and clear it forced a final chord types under a folder called Actions.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.950
This type start chairs is going to simply clear it.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.580
What are the action types?

00:04:26.580 --> 00:04:29.130
So instead of using strings everywhere,

00:04:29.130 --> 00:04:30.700
we can create constants.

00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:35.650
So if they export const that's called as our underscore contact,

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.360
which is just going to represent the same thing so that you can either use the actual

00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.410
string are you can use the constant seven copy this couple of times.

00:04:45.410 --> 00:04:49.350
The 2nd 1 is gonna be something called delete Contact.

00:04:49.350 --> 00:04:53.640
The 3rd 1 is going to be something like fetch contacts.

00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:59.370
This is supposed to give the initial state save this.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:02.130
And now let's clear a reducer.

00:05:02.130 --> 00:05:03.270
Now,

00:05:03.270 --> 00:05:03.860
relax.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:06.910
Store can be created using one or more stores.

00:05:06.910 --> 00:05:07.580
For example,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:08.760
in a bigger application,

00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:12.030
you may have a store toe deal with products.

00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.060
You might have a store to maintain the customers.

00:05:15.060 --> 00:05:18.250
You may have the store toe work with employees and so on.

00:05:18.250 --> 00:05:21.430
So right now we're gonna have only one store,

00:05:21.430 --> 00:05:25.150
which is car as contacts store under SRC.

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:31.440
I'm gonna clear a new five which is going to be placed under reducers slash It's called it

00:05:31.440 --> 00:05:32.340
US context.

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:34.050
Reduce it Dr.

00:05:34.050 --> 00:05:34.670
J S.

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.430
And the context user is going to be a function that we're gonna exports are gonna say

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.950
export default,

00:05:40.950 --> 00:05:47.430
which takes current stage from the store on an action being dispatched.

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:51.200
We are supposed to modify the state based on the action,

00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.150
stipe and then return the modified state.

00:05:54.150 --> 00:06:00.320
It also assumed that the state is going to be an object with one of the property is in a

00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:06.740
hurry or contacts now to take the action type Let's put this switch and then die.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:10.280
Pure action dot type kiss.

00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:18.690
We have this ad on deck as a constant from this particular taste RJ's And if that is the

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:19.170
case,

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.790
we're gonna say great for now.

00:06:20.790 --> 00:06:30.850
Like whether there's a case delete contact with their big in gives if it is fetch contacts

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:30.850
.

00:06:30.850 --> 00:06:31.990
Then again,

00:06:31.990 --> 00:06:32.880
this is a brick.

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:36.010
And in case if it is default,

00:06:36.010 --> 00:06:39.750
we're gonna sing live it on the current state itself.

00:06:39.750 --> 00:06:40.160
First,

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:43.620
let's go on at the core for this particular case.

00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:44.890
We're amorous.

00:06:44.890 --> 00:06:51.490
A Let contacts is gonna come from the current state started Mondex.

00:06:51.490 --> 00:06:57.420
So we're gonna appear a new audio based on the current context that we have.

00:06:57.420 --> 00:07:00.230
All I have to do is tow Take the action,

00:07:00.230 --> 00:07:00.850
your data,

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:03.000
which represents one new contact.

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.070
And I should be pushing that into this away.

00:07:06.070 --> 00:07:07.460
So it's a action,

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:08.350
got data,

00:07:08.350 --> 00:07:12.520
But we also may have to gender an idea for the same.

00:07:12.520 --> 00:07:17.220
It's clearly variable called new I d equals toe one.

00:07:17.220 --> 00:07:20.710
In case this contacts has one or more elements,

00:07:20.710 --> 00:07:26.310
we now have to find out where the maximum I did the context and then we have to increment

00:07:26.310 --> 00:07:30.690
the same someone say if contact starts lend District at zero.

00:07:30.690 --> 00:07:32.880
So to find the maximum i d.

00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:34.390
In the context collection,

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:36.930
we can make it so the Mad Dog Max.

00:07:36.930 --> 00:07:39.600
But we need a bunch of ideas for the theme,

00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.540
so to convert the contacts into a bunch of ideas.

00:07:42.540 --> 00:07:48.350
Angry is the map function which takes one contact and returns the ideas from the same.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:55.420
Now I can take this and supply toe bad dark max like this and then saved plus one one.

00:07:55.420 --> 00:07:57.130
Small problem is that mattered.

00:07:57.130 --> 00:07:58.930
Max does not taken away,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:01.610
but it takes the unusual values from Dari.

00:08:01.610 --> 00:08:02.780
It's very simple.

00:08:02.780 --> 00:08:05.130
I can simply spread the values from the area.

00:08:05.130 --> 00:08:06.420
This is fine,

00:08:06.420 --> 00:08:09.200
but we don't have to ascend this toe new i d.

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.280
We got the new idea and now I can say that action dark data are ideally goes to the newly

00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:16.210
gender to i d.

00:08:16.210 --> 00:08:21.840
Either it is one or it is the maximum i d plus one from the collection.

00:08:21.840 --> 00:08:24.140
Now that we have stored this,

00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:26.890
we now have to return the modified state.

00:08:26.890 --> 00:08:27.990
So remember,

00:08:27.990 --> 00:08:34.560
state is an object This time I have to say we've done and new object from the current state

00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.610
plus contacts.

00:08:36.610 --> 00:08:39.280
So this is gonna go like a name value pair.

00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.010
It is as if you're type contact,

00:08:41.010 --> 00:08:42.160
school and context,

00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.250
But in years six.

00:08:43.250 --> 00:08:44.650
You don't have to do this anymore.

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.220
Since return is more stronger than break,

00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:48.740
we don't need the break statement.

00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:52.790
Let's format this on our Our contact is ready.

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:53.590
Similarly,

00:08:53.590 --> 00:08:55.630
if I want to work with the delete contact,

00:08:55.630 --> 00:08:59.980
I will get the contacts and then I will get the action Dark Data,

00:08:59.980 --> 00:09:04.540
which represents the i d with search for the index off the particular I d.

00:09:04.540 --> 00:09:07.190
And then we supplies the door from the contact.

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:09.550
So I'm gonna copy this and based,

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:15.880
and then we're gonna find that index like this context are fine.

00:09:15.880 --> 00:09:16.660
Index,

00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:23.640
We received one contact at a time and we're going to return a cedar ID triple equals toe

00:09:23.640 --> 00:09:24.420
action.

00:09:24.420 --> 00:09:25.240
Your data.

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:26.360
Assuming the action,

00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:27.800
that data is the i d.

00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.950
We check if index not equals toe minus one,

00:09:31.950 --> 00:09:36.130
then we have to delete that from the context For that,

00:09:36.130 --> 00:09:43.040
we can use the slight function which deletes a given number of elements from the given

00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:43.650
Index.

00:09:43.650 --> 00:09:46.720
Now that we have got the new contacts here,

00:09:46.720 --> 00:09:47.990
the modified context.

00:09:47.990 --> 00:09:50.650
We just have written the new state,

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:55.890
and I'm gonna do the same thing over here as you may see that there is a warning or another

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:56.220
here.

00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.210
That's because we have used the let keyword for creating a variable on that becomes a

00:10:01.210 --> 00:10:01.690
variable,

00:10:01.690 --> 00:10:03.020
which is scope within this,

00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:04.690
and you can't define it twice.

00:10:04.690 --> 00:10:09.470
We can avoid that by surrounding this entire statement using a country brackets are making

00:10:09.470 --> 00:10:14.520
itself as a separate block and now this variable becomes a block level on the block.

00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:17.540
Is this one the same thing I'm also gonna do over here?

00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:22.300
I'm gonna cut this from here with a curly bracket and then based format accord.

00:10:22.300 --> 00:10:24.890
So now our believe contact is also ready.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:30.600
The French conduct is going to receive on a day off contact objects and we just have to

00:10:30.600 --> 00:10:32.220
return that as a new state.

00:10:32.220 --> 00:10:34.930
And that can be done by removing this break,

00:10:34.930 --> 00:10:41.810
putting a career record return a new object which consists of the state as well as the

00:10:41.810 --> 00:10:43.260
action Dark data,

00:10:43.260 --> 00:10:45.550
which is gonna be in a day off,

00:10:45.550 --> 00:10:48.130
values our context.

00:10:48.130 --> 00:10:49.630
Loser now is ready.

00:10:49.630 --> 00:10:53.590
Very dark store can be created using one or more reducers,

00:10:53.590 --> 00:10:56.370
but you're combined them together into a single red desert.

00:10:56.370 --> 00:10:57.590
And by convention,

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:58.990
we call this as a router.

00:10:58.990 --> 00:10:59.450
Dither.

00:10:59.450 --> 00:11:01.630
So under the reduces folder,

00:11:01.630 --> 00:11:05.790
like scared a new file called good producer Dodgy s,

00:11:05.790 --> 00:11:09.140
which is simply going to combine on the reduces that we have.

00:11:09.140 --> 00:11:11.370
Right now we have only one but didn't care.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:12.670
If you have political reduces,

00:11:12.670 --> 00:11:16.710
we're gonna combine all of them together and then didn't seem so far this week.

00:11:16.710 --> 00:11:21.480
Unforced import a function from the Election Caldas.

00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:23.190
Combine The users,

00:11:23.190 --> 00:11:26.020
like the name says its job is to combine the readers.

00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:28.740
And the only reason that we have is the contractor dessert.

00:11:28.740 --> 00:11:30.730
That's also import the same thing.

00:11:30.730 --> 00:11:31.400
That's politics.

00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:41.410
Context reducer dot slash contacts with user on We know how to say export default Combine

00:11:41.410 --> 00:11:42.380
reducers,

00:11:42.380 --> 00:11:48.140
which takes an object of the perimeter and the objects key values are important.

00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.010
The key is going to be the name that you want to identify.

00:11:51.010 --> 00:11:51.950
They deserve it.

00:11:51.950 --> 00:11:57.990
So I'm gonna use it as a font extra do that itself which correspond toe the same object so

00:11:57.990 --> 00:12:00.700
I could as well give context or desert like this.

00:12:00.700 --> 00:12:02.390
But in year six,

00:12:02.390 --> 00:12:05.650
this is Samos not giving this a top.

00:12:05.650 --> 00:12:06.920
Save this.

00:12:06.920 --> 00:12:08.240
Now we have the router Desert.

00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.860
Now let's go to the index,

00:12:09.860 --> 00:12:12.350
Georges and clear the store for us.

00:12:12.350 --> 00:12:23.290
So the create store is a function in the readers that import that like this since God

00:12:23.290 --> 00:12:24.650
cleared store.

00:12:24.650 --> 00:12:33.980
And we also have to import the route reducer from dot slash producer slash group producer

00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:40.420
And now I can see your pants store equals to create stool on,

00:12:40.420 --> 00:12:42.430
then supply the route reducer.

00:12:42.430 --> 00:12:46.170
Now that the story is ready,

00:12:46.170 --> 00:12:52.790
we can make that store available toe all off my components using a component provided by

00:12:52.790 --> 00:12:54.250
react readers.

00:12:54.250 --> 00:12:55.620
It's called US provider.

00:12:55.620 --> 00:13:01.050
That's import the same from three and readers.

00:13:01.050 --> 00:13:02.910
It's called for wider.

00:13:02.910 --> 00:13:04.540
So I'm gonna take your for whiter,

00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:10.430
and then you use this component and surround all this section using the company.

00:13:10.430 --> 00:13:16.640
So we take your for wider store equals toe the variable weaker over years.

00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:21.980
Some say your store and slash or order is gonna be right here.

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:23.590
Save this.

00:13:23.590 --> 00:13:24.300
Now,

00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:25.280
with this way,

00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:30.560
the store is gonna be made available toe all of my components like contact,

00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:30.950
form,

00:13:30.950 --> 00:13:33.610
contact lists or even the contact car,

00:13:33.610 --> 00:13:35.590
which is used in the contact list as well.

00:13:35.590 --> 00:13:41.050
So any changes done using this contact form by dispatching an action to the store?

00:13:41.050 --> 00:13:46.500
The story gets modified and the changes to the store will now be made available to the

00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:48.790
contact list in the form of subscriptions.

00:13:48.790 --> 00:13:53.320
In order to check if our application configuration is correct or not,

00:13:53.320 --> 00:13:58.070
we can now enable the readers dentals extensions to do that.

00:13:58.070 --> 00:13:58.480
For us.

00:13:58.480 --> 00:14:03.360
That's import from Redux totals.

00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:04.150
Extension.

00:14:04.150 --> 00:14:05.380
Remember,

00:14:05.380 --> 00:14:07.630
we need is something for composed.

00:14:07.630 --> 00:14:08.420
Their tools.

00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:09.470
It's a function.

00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:12.350
You just sort of pass it along with the story here.

00:14:12.350 --> 00:14:17.460
Onda Call that function If you save this and if you go back to the browser,

00:14:17.460 --> 00:14:17.930
no,

00:14:17.930 --> 00:14:19.280
we don't see any errors.

00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:26.550
If I go to the view developer developer tools and then switch toe the readers over here

00:14:26.550 --> 00:14:32.310
this time we're now seeing the actual state information on the current state.

00:14:32.310 --> 00:14:33.760
If you go and have a look at this,

00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:35.690
it says on text reducer,

00:14:35.690 --> 00:14:37.560
which is an array of contacts.

00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:39.240
The empty collection,

00:14:39.240 --> 00:14:40.010
called Context,

00:14:40.010 --> 00:14:42.770
is coming because in our context or desert,

00:14:42.770 --> 00:14:44.700
we made that as the default value.

00:14:44.700 --> 00:14:46.630
Here also,

00:14:46.630 --> 00:14:50.130
that default is being returned from this deformed section.

00:14:50.130 --> 00:14:57.510
The name contents producer here is coming from the root producers property here.

00:14:57.510 --> 00:15:00.360
This is considered as a property as well as a value.

00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:06.130
But if I give here something like ex wives that Hollande making this is a property name.

00:15:06.130 --> 00:15:08.480
If I save this and go back to the closer you,

00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:12.720
Nancy that it says that the name off your producer is exquisite,

00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.510
which represents this state.

00:15:14.510 --> 00:15:18.420
Obviously we don't want this to be exquisite and it's a good idea.

00:15:18.420 --> 00:15:19.540
Toe remove that.

00:15:19.540 --> 00:15:20.700
Save this.

00:15:20.700 --> 00:15:24.960
So contacts Producer has a property called Contact,

00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.640
which represents,

00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.800
and Ari this really looks.

00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:32.510
Deftones Extension also provides safe facility for us to dispatch in action.

00:15:32.510 --> 00:15:35.520
It has got a template here that says type is what?

00:15:35.520 --> 00:15:36.240
In our case,

00:15:36.240 --> 00:15:38.020
it's supposed to be contact.

00:15:38.020 --> 00:15:43.260
And the paler is the data which is considered as an object I'm gonna like.

00:15:43.260 --> 00:15:51.600
Your name is not email is We know that you know on that should be good enough If I click on

00:15:51.600 --> 00:15:52.500
the dispatch now,

00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:57.120
you'll see that initially it is an empty every as soon a they click on the dispatch Britain

00:15:57.120 --> 00:15:57.120
,

00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.970
You should know see that the action has been dispatched and I should see this name.

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.950
We know emails also with an idea off one.

00:16:04.950 --> 00:16:06.300
And if I change this,

00:16:06.300 --> 00:16:07.660
we don't do something else.

00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:08.800
That's for example,

00:16:08.800 --> 00:16:18.640
Shah on email toe say shaman example dot com home,

00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.630
then take on its touch.

00:16:20.630 --> 00:16:21.110
You know,

00:16:21.110 --> 00:16:21.600
See,

00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.150
that is also being added over here.

00:16:24.150 --> 00:16:25.280
Similarly,

00:16:25.280 --> 00:16:28.540
I can send a delete contact as an action,

00:16:28.540 --> 00:16:36.220
with data being the index I can supply this one are to someone supply one on Mexican

00:16:36.220 --> 00:16:36.780
dispatch.

00:16:36.780 --> 00:16:41.510
You'll see that that particular element has been removed from my contacts collection.

00:16:41.510 --> 00:16:45.200
Now we know that our happy is configured properly with the Redick store.

00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:48.800
We now have to create work school action functions.

00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:51.270
It's going to our core under the actions.

00:16:51.270 --> 00:16:53.750
Let's create a file or contacts,

00:16:53.750 --> 00:16:55.950
actions start cheese.

00:16:55.950 --> 00:17:01.380
And this is where we're gonna write functions that our components can call such as,

00:17:01.380 --> 00:17:02.120
for example,

00:17:02.120 --> 00:17:04.460
on a new contract or deleted contact,

00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.570
our fetch contacts and so on.

00:17:06.570 --> 00:17:11.260
Let's begin by reading a function card Fitch Context.

00:17:11.260 --> 00:17:17.550
So this is supposed to be a function that is supposed to written another function.

00:17:17.550 --> 00:17:20.500
So if you remember the carrier functions earlier.

00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:22.200
This is one such case.

00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:24.480
So I'm gonna return a function again,

00:17:24.480 --> 00:17:28.500
which deceased dispatched as a argument.

00:17:28.500 --> 00:17:33.350
And then we're gonna use the dispatch function to dispatch an action.

00:17:33.350 --> 00:17:33.860
Now,

00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:34.480
if you're wondering,

00:17:34.480 --> 00:17:35.670
how is this gonna work?

00:17:35.670 --> 00:17:36.990
Something like this.

00:17:36.990 --> 00:17:40.050
When we call this function called fetch contact.

00:17:40.050 --> 00:17:41.000
Relax.

00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:44.230
Will intercept that on passes that Mary wait.

00:17:44.230 --> 00:17:49.690
The middleware will collect your generally which is stays and cause dysfunction by

00:17:49.690 --> 00:17:52.940
supplying the stored or despatched function effectively.

00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:53.950
This is a function,

00:17:53.950 --> 00:17:55.660
and we can call this function now.

00:17:55.660 --> 00:17:56.150
Here.

00:17:56.150 --> 00:17:59.240
So which means in any off hour components,

00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.800
we never have to say stolen our dispatch.

00:18:01.800 --> 00:18:05.110
So the store is going to be transparent toe all the components.

00:18:05.110 --> 00:18:07.790
None of the components will ever use the word store.

00:18:07.790 --> 00:18:10.660
All I'm gonna do is to create an action,

00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:11.690
for example.

00:18:11.690 --> 00:18:15.930
I can say let action equals to an object.

00:18:15.930 --> 00:18:19.880
And I can say type is nothing but fetch contacts.

00:18:19.880 --> 00:18:24.140
Andi data for the same is going to be on our way.

00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:28.940
And I'm gonna paste and are off three contacts here with I D.

00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:32.710
Names also are there already and collapse the same.

00:18:32.710 --> 00:18:34.090
We have the action.

00:18:34.090 --> 00:18:38.270
All we have to do is tow dispatch the same like this.

00:18:38.270 --> 00:18:39.820
Now,

00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.170
whenever dysfunction is being called automatically,

00:18:43.170 --> 00:18:48.400
it's going toe trigger an action called Fetch Contacts and the fetch contacts is going to

00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:49.700
be checked over here.

00:18:49.700 --> 00:18:53.580
We simply replace the current state with this action data,

00:18:53.580 --> 00:18:54.950
which is an object.

00:18:54.950 --> 00:18:56.290
Let's go back here.

00:18:56.290 --> 00:19:00.430
It's also clear a second function Export Const.

00:19:00.430 --> 00:19:02.450
Al Qaeda's at Contact,

00:19:02.450 --> 00:19:10.360
which is a function that receives a contact object where we're supposed to return this.

00:19:10.360 --> 00:19:11.570
Enter stuff.

00:19:11.570 --> 00:19:15.240
So instead of raiding a college record and then Cerrito this time on,

00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:19.310
type your dispatch like this using dysfunction,

00:19:19.310 --> 00:19:21.090
we're supposed to dispatch an action,

00:19:21.090 --> 00:19:23.790
and this time I can do it in a one line.

00:19:23.790 --> 00:19:29.820
I can say this patch off in college records a type these are underscore.

00:19:29.820 --> 00:19:34.360
Contact data is nothing but the contact we received over here.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:36.230
Similarly,

00:19:36.230 --> 00:19:43.500
I can have one more function called delete contact which is going toe receive the I D to be

00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:44.140
needed.

00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:47.600
And will it'll a function which gets the statues.

00:19:47.600 --> 00:19:54.090
An argument on all I have to do is to call the dispatch function with take as delete

00:19:54.090 --> 00:19:59.000
contact and then later is nothing with the idea to be deleted.

00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:03.050
Save this and our actions already.

00:20:03.050 --> 00:20:07.110
Since these actions are going to be used in our,

00:20:07.110 --> 00:20:07.560
um,

00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:12.550
we have toe have a day off associating this with the readers.

00:20:12.550 --> 00:20:13.240
First,

00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:15.340
let's go toe over contact list.

00:20:15.340 --> 00:20:19.090
Dodgy s where we want toe call this fetch contacts,

00:20:19.090 --> 00:20:20.670
function from our action.

00:20:20.670 --> 00:20:23.260
But if I call that function by myself,

00:20:23.260 --> 00:20:29.260
then the function called will return another function which is off no use to me because I

00:20:29.260 --> 00:20:31.750
don't know how to supply the dispatch function.

00:20:31.750 --> 00:20:37.150
So this is where our reactor Redux package comes into picture and from the reactor,

00:20:37.150 --> 00:20:38.010
That's package.

00:20:38.010 --> 00:20:42.980
We're gonna import something or connect like this.

00:20:42.980 --> 00:20:44.260
We're gonna say here,

00:20:44.260 --> 00:20:48.660
connect on the connect function returns a higher a competent.

00:20:48.660 --> 00:20:54.480
All I have to do is tow Call the tenant function like this and the return value is a viral

00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:55.160
component.

00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.060
And I supply my contact list over like this.

00:20:58.060 --> 00:20:59.950
If I save this,

00:20:59.950 --> 00:21:01.450
go back to the browser.

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:04.690
We don't see any errors assets,

00:21:04.690 --> 00:21:05.150
but of course,

00:21:05.150 --> 00:21:07.010
we're not seeing any results.

00:21:07.010 --> 00:21:08.110
That's close This.

00:21:08.110 --> 00:21:14.700
Go back to the court and bring the state maintained by the store as a property here and the

00:21:14.700 --> 00:21:17.920
registers is the connect function takes two parameters here.

00:21:17.920 --> 00:21:24.300
I'm gonna call this as state as props on actions as frost.

00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:24.930
Obviously,

00:21:24.930 --> 00:21:26.020
I don't have these variables.

00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:32.420
That's clear them so that they can state as from's equals toe currently none on another one

00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:40.600
called actions as props equals toe as the names it is here we can map the state maintained

00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:47.520
by the store as props off this particular component on actions that were defined also as

00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:49.930
properties off this particular component.

00:21:49.930 --> 00:21:54.290
While we do not supply any properties from the parent toe here,

00:21:54.290 --> 00:21:57.820
the props are actually injected by videos.

00:21:57.820 --> 00:22:01.270
The state is accessible to us through reducers.

00:22:01.270 --> 00:22:07.180
All I have to do is to write a function here that receives reducer as perimeter and then

00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:09.590
from the readies RB pick what data we want.

00:22:09.590 --> 00:22:14.680
And we returned that let's right that someone write a function here that gets me all the

00:22:14.680 --> 00:22:15.770
reasons we have.

00:22:15.770 --> 00:22:20.830
And all we have to do is to return an object.

00:22:20.830 --> 00:22:23.020
And the key is whatever we want.

00:22:23.020 --> 00:22:24.530
We can call it this context.

00:22:24.530 --> 00:22:31.640
But from this reduces which the collection of rib users we have one producer for context,

00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:35.140
reduce it and then has an array or 26.

00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:43.190
And then this action as props is simply a an object representing all the functions that we

00:22:43.190 --> 00:22:46.230
want and the functions are defined in contacts,

00:22:46.230 --> 00:22:49.490
actions on Do we need to import that force?

00:22:49.490 --> 00:22:50.490
So it's quite important,

00:22:50.490 --> 00:22:55.580
seem import from dogs.

00:22:55.580 --> 00:23:01.610
Last actions slash context actions and what we want right now is the fetch context.

00:23:01.610 --> 00:23:05.490
Now associate this particular function as a property off.

00:23:05.490 --> 00:23:10.690
My component I'll have to do is to say that this is a function that I want.

00:23:10.690 --> 00:23:11.210
Of course,

00:23:11.210 --> 00:23:12.760
I can give it a name by Lupin,

00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:13.850
but in the year six,

00:23:13.850 --> 00:23:14.560
this is OK.

00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.000
Now,

00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:16.760
if I save this now,

00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.280
we have access to that.

00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:19.090
No errors,

00:23:19.090 --> 00:23:22.630
especially if you go toe view developer tools on.

00:23:22.630 --> 00:23:24.230
If it's a jobless kept council,

00:23:24.230 --> 00:23:26.170
we don't see an era.

00:23:26.170 --> 00:23:29.340
But now I can go to my component here.

00:23:29.340 --> 00:23:34.400
I'm gonna are here something guard component due to mount on their recall,

00:23:34.400 --> 00:23:37.160
the function or fits contacts.

00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:39.110
But it's coming as props.

00:23:39.110 --> 00:23:45.620
I can simply say you're this dark crops don't fetch contacts noticed there this time,

00:23:45.620 --> 00:23:49.630
and I call this function here it is not the same as this function here.

00:23:49.630 --> 00:23:50.360
Okay.

00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:53.580
The function here is the one that we have used year,

00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:54.150
for example.

00:23:54.150 --> 00:23:55.380
Instead of fits contact,

00:23:55.380 --> 00:23:56.350
I could have called.

00:23:56.350 --> 00:23:58.350
It does get all context.

00:23:58.350 --> 00:23:59.460
That's the key.

00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.520
So obviously this is the one that's coming as props to me.

00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:04.770
Start a call here now as dark,

00:24:04.770 --> 00:24:06.910
get all contacts like this.

00:24:06.910 --> 00:24:12.840
So when I conned is this is when Redux will intercept it and supply the stored or

00:24:12.840 --> 00:24:13.910
despatched function.

00:24:13.910 --> 00:24:17.350
Tow us so that we can dispatch from here.

00:24:17.350 --> 00:24:19.910
If I say this and go back to the closer,

00:24:19.910 --> 00:24:24.570
we will see one other and the other says actions must be playing objects.

00:24:24.570 --> 00:24:26.970
Use custom away for easing actions.

00:24:26.970 --> 00:24:30.370
And the reason for this error is because when we call this,

00:24:30.370 --> 00:24:34.680
someone should do the job off passing on this dispatch function to me.

00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:37.300
Relax by itself doesn't do that.

00:24:37.300 --> 00:24:42.140
We use something called middle waves here on one of the popular middleweight is called punk

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:42.140
.

00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:52.880
So we go to the indexed RGs we're gonna import tongue from it's called readers tongue and

00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.230
we take this tongue and we pass it on as a middle over here on our middle ways You also

00:24:59.230 --> 00:25:04.010
want one more thing from the readers are as apply middle Bill as the names of this.

00:25:04.010 --> 00:25:08.560
It takes some vigorous and apply the same like a now positive over here saying,

00:25:08.560 --> 00:25:11.150
Apply middle bill off tongue.

00:25:11.150 --> 00:25:13.180
Say this.

00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:15.550
And if you go back to the closer on,

00:25:15.550 --> 00:25:18.020
if you see we should have seen some data here,

00:25:18.020 --> 00:25:19.210
that must be some better.

00:25:19.210 --> 00:25:23.780
Let's go to view developer developer tools on.

00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.640
We don't see any errors over here.

00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:27.750
Let's go there Redux and in relax.

00:25:27.750 --> 00:25:29.760
We will see that in the state.

00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:32.660
We have all the three context that is coming up,

00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:35.200
which means it's not showing over here.

00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:38.210
It's gonna have a look at our context reducer.

00:25:38.210 --> 00:25:39.350
Andi.

00:25:39.350 --> 00:25:45.170
I think the fetch as a small issue here because this is the state object that we're giving

00:25:45.170 --> 00:25:45.580
envious,

00:25:45.580 --> 00:25:48.770
spreading and other here instead of spreading in our day,

00:25:48.770 --> 00:25:50.470
we have to say contacts,

00:25:50.470 --> 00:25:52.550
colon action data.

00:25:52.550 --> 00:25:55.870
If I save this and go back to the browser and never see,

00:25:55.870 --> 00:25:59.050
we got all the three elements over here.

00:25:59.050 --> 00:26:02.340
Suppose we want to provide the delete functionality here,

00:26:02.340 --> 00:26:04.100
which is currently not did.

00:26:04.100 --> 00:26:04.590
It's very,

00:26:04.590 --> 00:26:05.610
very simple Now,

00:26:05.610 --> 00:26:08.600
if I go back to our contact card.

00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.540
All have to do is tow.

00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.390
Call the function called delete from here.

00:26:14.390 --> 00:26:15.320
So this is the function.

00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.260
Better call believed contact,

00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:19.290
which takes idea the perimeter.

00:26:19.290 --> 00:26:22.220
So let's go to the contact car first.

00:26:22.220 --> 00:26:23.950
Let's due to imports.

00:26:23.950 --> 00:26:28.660
1st 1 is connect from react readers.

00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:36.730
2nd 1 is our action that would say import from door slash action slash contact actions.

00:26:36.730 --> 00:26:40.240
What we want important here is the daily contact function.

00:26:40.240 --> 00:26:46.140
Now the believe contact function has to be connected toe or component.

00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.360
And to do that,

00:26:47.360 --> 00:26:54.770
let's come back here with they connect and then supply this contact card as a perimeter.

00:26:54.770 --> 00:26:58.370
This time we don't want any state from the store,

00:26:58.370 --> 00:27:00.080
so I can supply This is now,

00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:06.590
but we want to supply a function to be injected as a property on again name by Luke.

00:27:06.590 --> 00:27:07.830
Kids is your choice.

00:27:07.830 --> 00:27:08.760
For example,

00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:16.180
I can say remove contact is nothing but the action that we have our elite contact.

00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:21.960
So the property received by my component is this but indirectly is gonna trick up this

00:27:21.960 --> 00:27:22.830
particular function.

00:27:22.830 --> 00:27:24.310
If you're OK,

00:27:24.310 --> 00:27:27.760
you can have the same name as the blade contact,

00:27:27.760 --> 00:27:31.500
which means this is not going to be injected with that property to this.

00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.340
I can type your along with the proper people contact,

00:27:35.340 --> 00:27:36.950
which is coming from the period.

00:27:36.950 --> 00:27:40.120
This one is coming from the reactor.

00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:41.100
Iraq's combination.

00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.260
Now that we have the ability contact here,

00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:47.240
I can call that function over here that this is my Parton.

00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:50.580
I'll say something like on Click,

00:27:50.580 --> 00:27:52.950
because toe in college bracket,

00:27:52.950 --> 00:27:56.490
I'm gonna provide a function on in that function,

00:27:56.490 --> 00:28:01.590
I would say delete contact on then the contact our idly as the perimeter.

00:28:01.590 --> 00:28:02.910
I saved this.

00:28:02.910 --> 00:28:04.470
Go back to the browser,

00:28:04.470 --> 00:28:05.910
check on this,

00:28:05.910 --> 00:28:09.310
Deal it over here and you can see that the contact is deleted.

00:28:09.310 --> 00:28:15.440
All we're doing is we're actually dispatching an action here that affects the store.

00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:20.730
And the changes to the store are automatically reflector in the contact list here because

00:28:20.730 --> 00:28:24.350
we said that we want this contacts to coming from the store.

00:28:24.350 --> 00:28:25.290
Similarly,

00:28:25.290 --> 00:28:30.480
we cannot go where the functionality for this it is already doing all the validations.

00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:33.930
But if I take something over here and kick on the active list,

00:28:33.930 --> 00:28:36.710
that should be added over here Once again,

00:28:36.710 --> 00:28:37.860
it's gonna be very,

00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:44.950
really simple I'm gonna go into the contact form import what we want One is the connect

00:28:44.950 --> 00:28:48.590
from the reactive eaters.

00:28:48.590 --> 00:28:52.950
Second is the action that we want,

00:28:52.950 --> 00:29:00.850
which is guard eye contact from dot slash action slash contact actions.

00:29:00.850 --> 00:29:07.080
And then we have to connect dysfunction with our component using this connect a Chelsea

00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.060
come down toe the end.

00:29:09.060 --> 00:29:12.650
We're exporting here as they connect once again.

00:29:12.650 --> 00:29:14.610
I don't need any state from the store,

00:29:14.610 --> 00:29:21.650
but I want the art contact function to be propagated toe this component as a prop on.

00:29:21.650 --> 00:29:22.990
Now that I have this,

00:29:22.990 --> 00:29:28.410
I can come down toe the location where I'm supposed to call that And I can simply say

00:29:28.410 --> 00:29:37.000
you're distort from start contact on the variable contact here is being supplied and save

00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:37.460
this.

00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:39.460
Go back to the browser,

00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:40.890
Add in a name.

00:29:40.890 --> 00:29:48.430
Let's say we know we know what caused the email phone number on a picture.

00:29:48.430 --> 00:29:50.090
A kick on active list.

00:29:50.090 --> 00:29:56.890
You can see that a new record has been editor contact list daily also works as well as I

00:29:56.890 --> 00:29:57.940
can add new ones.

00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:02.210
Now suppose that we want to get the later from our restaurant point.

00:30:02.210 --> 00:30:03.170
How do we do that?

00:30:03.170 --> 00:30:03.830
let's go.

00:30:03.830 --> 00:30:04.790
And just the same.

00:30:04.790 --> 00:30:05.970
But before that,

00:30:05.970 --> 00:30:08.790
let's go and start our rest in point.

00:30:08.790 --> 00:30:10.300
I'm going to open a new town.

00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:11.250
Dave,

00:30:11.250 --> 00:30:13.550
your NPM run rest,

00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:13.880
sir.

00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:14.170
Well,

00:30:14.170 --> 00:30:19.350
which starts our restaurant point at this particular port.

00:30:19.350 --> 00:30:23.080
And we can very for the same thing by going to the browser.

00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:33.100
Local host 4000 slash contacts and we have the list off all the 50 contacts over here.

00:30:33.100 --> 00:30:38.180
And let's go door actions where we have the contacts.

00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:39.470
Action orgs,

00:30:39.470 --> 00:30:40.670
this is Well,

00:30:40.670 --> 00:30:43.470
we're dispatching an action on the action.

00:30:43.470 --> 00:30:46.690
Contains currently a hardcore did our A off data,

00:30:46.690 --> 00:30:47.840
but instead,

00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.770
we would like to make a request over rest endpoint,

00:30:50.770 --> 00:30:56.100
get the later and then dispatch that as part of the action to do so,

00:30:56.100 --> 00:31:02.570
I'm gonna delete this one and create a variable year card.

00:31:02.570 --> 00:31:03.200
You are,

00:31:03.200 --> 00:31:09.640
which is gonna be our it city people and local host Colin 4000 slash contacts.

00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:16.810
Let's make it at the fetch FBI that takes Ural as the perimeter and returns a promise

00:31:16.810 --> 00:31:17.550
object.

00:31:17.550 --> 00:31:20.450
And if you want to resolve the promise object,

00:31:20.450 --> 00:31:28.360
you can always say here something like arrest equals toe await and fetch your so now the

00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:33.380
promises resort and we get the actual response we need to get the Jason from Bates are

00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:38.760
going to say let contacts equals toe a weight off rest,

00:31:38.760 --> 00:31:39.560
Jason.

00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:42.490
Now we have the actual contacts over here,

00:31:42.490 --> 00:31:45.640
and the contacts have to be part of the action.

00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.370
I'm gonna create action equals toe type with,

00:31:49.370 --> 00:31:49.820
say,

00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:54.840
fetch contacts and data is nothing but the contacts that we received.

00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:57.300
And now we're starting their action.

00:31:57.300 --> 00:32:03.200
The only constraint here is that we can only use the of eight keeper if dysfunction is and

00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:04.190
pacing functions,

00:32:04.190 --> 00:32:06.510
I'm gonna add that you think you were over here.

00:32:06.510 --> 00:32:08.660
Now we have our Fitch contacts,

00:32:08.660 --> 00:32:11.160
which gets the data from a resting point.

00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.620
And if I go back to the browser,

00:32:12.620 --> 00:32:14.860
we should see all the context over here.

00:32:14.860 --> 00:32:15.450
But effect,

00:32:15.450 --> 00:32:16.110
like on this deal,

00:32:16.110 --> 00:32:20.940
it it is only going to be deleting locally on If I refresh that,

00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.360
you would see that the data comes back once again.

00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:24.340
So,

00:32:24.340 --> 00:32:26.920
in order to delete this from more resting point,

00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:30.490
we have to convert these functions also in the singular fashion.

00:32:30.490 --> 00:32:37.500
So I'm gonna make this one as an anything function here and then I come here and then say,

00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:37.620
Oh,

00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.160
wait,

00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.130
fish,

00:32:40.130 --> 00:32:46.870
You are plus the idea because the journalist contact slash followed by the idea whatever

00:32:46.870 --> 00:32:48.290
the I really want to delete.

00:32:48.290 --> 00:32:54.450
And then we also have to specify that the matter is that we want to use is the http delete

00:32:54.450 --> 00:32:58.940
minted this time we don't have to worry about the response here because all we want to do

00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:02.080
is to send a delete request once that has been sent,

00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:06.820
we simply make a dispatch toe the store with a property information.

00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:07.890
So I'm gonna say this.

00:33:07.890 --> 00:33:13.310
Go back to the closer and select the 1st 1 and believe that you can see there's been

00:33:13.310 --> 00:33:13.890
deleted.

00:33:13.890 --> 00:33:15.190
If I refresh the browser,

00:33:15.190 --> 00:33:20.100
you'll see that it's been permanently deleted from the rest server itself.

00:33:20.100 --> 00:33:22.460
So we can try couple of more here,

00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:22.810
ideally,

00:33:22.810 --> 00:33:23.480
to more.

00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.350
I refresh and you'll see that it's been deleted.

00:33:26.350 --> 00:33:27.270
Similarly,

00:33:27.270 --> 00:33:28.830
if you want to are the new contact,

00:33:28.830 --> 00:33:31.400
let's goto our our contact function.

00:33:31.400 --> 00:33:37.150
Make this as an casing function and will make a request toe the remorse.

00:33:37.150 --> 00:33:37.330
Sir,

00:33:37.330 --> 00:33:39.330
we're using the http post.

00:33:39.330 --> 00:33:46.140
This has got a couple of additional parameters first that they let breast equals two of it

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:46.140
.

00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.220
Fitch.

00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:53.190
Off your and then we supply a conflict object.

00:33:53.190 --> 00:33:56.730
The perfect object has method as post second,

00:33:56.730 --> 00:33:59.440
we also have to supply the request body.

00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:05.240
This is nothing but Jason doctrine defy off the contact object the baby seal over here.

00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:09.940
We also have to specify that whatever we're sending is supposed to be considered as an

00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:10.620
application.

00:34:10.620 --> 00:34:11.130
Jason.

00:34:11.130 --> 00:34:13.020
So we're gonna add a does.

00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:19.700
And one of the head of these content dash type here will specify that its application slash

00:34:19.700 --> 00:34:20.270
Jason.

00:34:20.270 --> 00:34:21.550
Now,

00:34:21.550 --> 00:34:22.910
this response,

00:34:22.910 --> 00:34:26.000
when we received were extracted Jason from there.

00:34:26.000 --> 00:34:31.680
So again as they let new contact equals to rescue dot Just,

00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:32.050
uh,

00:34:32.050 --> 00:34:34.910
but this is also a promise dysfunction.

00:34:34.910 --> 00:34:36.390
We have to say a bait.

00:34:36.390 --> 00:34:37.680
And once we got it,

00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:39.060
this is our new contact.

00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:41.180
And that is what we will act over store.

00:34:41.180 --> 00:34:42.770
So I saved this.

00:34:42.770 --> 00:34:44.280
Go back to the browser,

00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:46.100
wait for it to refresh.

00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:48.440
I'm at a new values years.

00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.420
Are we not,

00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:55.330
we know have been Darko and the phone number and the picture.

00:34:55.330 --> 00:34:59.200
And notice that before I didn't If I come down to the bottom,

00:34:59.200 --> 00:35:00.630
I don't see my picture.

00:35:00.630 --> 00:35:05.600
So if I click on the submit here now that's been removed from here and added,

00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:06.590
If you see that,

00:35:06.590 --> 00:35:08.230
it's been added at the bottom.

00:35:08.230 --> 00:35:14.060
So this is how it is easy to work with Redux in React Application.
