00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.350
Before we get into our religious application and get data from arresting Point,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:13.480
let us set up a resting point first for this I'm in a combined front or terminal and I'm in

00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:14.600
my World Territory,

00:00:14.600 --> 00:00:16.910
which is the Chase Timo Dash one.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:17.610
Well,

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:24.720
I have my finds like Packaged or Jason and saw We stole a and B M package called Jason

00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:25.260
Serval.

00:00:25.260 --> 00:00:28.890
So we do the rotating being pie jesu underserved.

00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:35.280
And now that it's installed,

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.060
let's go back to the visuals to your court.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.150
Have a look at the packaged or jesu It has brought in the Jason Sarwar as a dependency.

00:00:45.150 --> 00:00:49.490
I will also add one more additional script entry here.

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:50.540
This is toe run,

00:00:50.540 --> 00:00:51.830
the Jason Server.

00:00:51.830 --> 00:00:56.250
So I'm gonna call this as rest serval as a key.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.640
You can be whatever you want.

00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.380
But the command for this is Jason.

00:01:00.380 --> 00:01:01.220
That's terrible.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:06.070
And optionally test as sport equals two.

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:07.310
For example,

00:01:07.310 --> 00:01:08.430
4000.

00:01:08.430 --> 00:01:10.860
And then we give your data trash watch,

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.010
followed by db slash data or Chaisson.

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:14.940
Now,

00:01:14.940 --> 00:01:19.860
if you're wondering what is happening here when you run this command NPM around dressed

00:01:19.860 --> 00:01:20.380
several.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.390
If in dark,

00:01:21.390 --> 00:01:22.640
a man gets executed,

00:01:22.640 --> 00:01:28.810
this command is available in north models dot bin folder.

00:01:28.810 --> 00:01:30.240
If you scroll down,

00:01:30.240 --> 00:01:31.450
you should see somewhere,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.800
Jason Server as a entry on Windows,

00:01:34.800 --> 00:01:35.470
you will see Jase,

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:36.970
answer or not cmd here.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:41.150
So this command runs a Jason Webster were on.

00:01:41.150 --> 00:01:46.080
We are specifying that the poor to be used its 4000 by the four take 3000.

00:01:46.080 --> 00:01:49.590
But our reactor were also occupies 3000.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:51.100
So there'll be a conflict in the port.

00:01:51.100 --> 00:01:54.630
So let's change it to something else like 4000 lost option.

00:01:54.630 --> 00:01:57.060
Here is DBS Last eight are Jason,

00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.200
which is actually a file in my project folder.

00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:01.300
Here you can see reactors,

00:02:01.300 --> 00:02:07.120
Demo one folder Condense a Baby as a folder and in the DB folder I have kept a file called

00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:08.070
Data Dark Jason,

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:15.690
which defines an object with the contacts as a property and then away off 50 objects over

00:02:15.690 --> 00:02:16.090
here.

00:02:16.090 --> 00:02:22.420
These 50 contacts object can now be exposed by this Jason's There were as a rest endpoint.

00:02:22.420 --> 00:02:23.780
Let me say this file.

00:02:23.780 --> 00:02:28.790
Go back to the command front and they've npm run,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:30.250
rest sorrow.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:38.090
I was entered and you will see that it's exposing the 100 off db slash data Jason as a

00:02:38.090 --> 00:02:39.090
resource here.

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:45.420
So I have this particular you are for the browser and try to go to the urine.

00:02:45.420 --> 00:02:48.950
You'll see now I have the 50 contacts over here.

00:02:48.950 --> 00:02:51.530
I can also search for a specific one.

00:02:51.530 --> 00:02:52.080
For example,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:56.060
insists last 22 you can see I get that by I d.

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:58.760
I can answer Type your question mark.

00:02:58.760 --> 00:03:05.950
Gender equals two made and I'll be listing out only the bill contact out of the 50.

00:03:05.950 --> 00:03:10.470
We can also do some imagination like question mark Page equals to one.

00:03:10.470 --> 00:03:14.210
I get the first feature indicating the records from 1 to 10.

00:03:14.210 --> 00:03:15.800
If I say page number two,

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.350
you'll see that I get from 11 to 20.

00:03:18.350 --> 00:03:20.500
So Jason Server is really good away.

00:03:20.500 --> 00:03:21.750
Off starting air.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:22.810
Local rest,

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:23.450
endpoint.

00:03:23.450 --> 00:03:24.450
Now that we have done,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.990
let's go back to our job studio code,

00:03:26.990 --> 00:03:31.070
Close this fine and have a look at what we have in our application.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.900
So under SRC,

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.030
I have a indexed R J s,

00:03:35.030 --> 00:03:37.650
which is actually a state full component,

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.670
not having anything in the state for now.

00:03:39.670 --> 00:03:44.490
And I have a heading that says using objects for getting data from Reston Point.

00:03:44.490 --> 00:03:51.530
I also have a contact card from the previous demonstration where I am supposed to supply a

00:03:51.530 --> 00:03:52.850
contact object.

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:56.610
And this is going to destroy the contact details in a nice fashion.

00:03:56.610 --> 00:04:01.770
So let's go ahead and start the development Web server by going to the command prompt for

00:04:01.770 --> 00:04:02.500
this application.

00:04:02.500 --> 00:04:05.220
We want this restaurant point toe run forever.

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.210
So we're not worry about this one.

00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:09.350
I goto shell you tab,

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:11.370
and then here I'm gonna die.

00:04:11.370 --> 00:04:15.070
NPM start to start the local Del Sur,

00:04:15.070 --> 00:04:17.760
where which runs on port number 3000.

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.450
Currently it is just displaying headed nothing else.

00:04:21.450 --> 00:04:24.360
What we want to do is in index jails.

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:27.530
We would like toa make a request toe the rest endpoint,

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:31.650
get the later and then pass it on to Hunter car.

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:33.020
For this,

00:04:33.020 --> 00:04:35.500
I will first make a request over here.

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:41.430
And the request is going to be made from the life cycle function component in March to

00:04:41.430 --> 00:04:43.940
making objects called We have few options.

00:04:43.940 --> 00:04:44.830
Number one,

00:04:44.830 --> 00:04:46.990
we can use Jake wedding number.

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:49.140
Do we can use the fetch a B A,

00:04:49.140 --> 00:04:51.460
which is part of the JavaScript.

00:04:51.460 --> 00:04:53.740
You don't have to add any additional light release.

00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:54.510
Number three.

00:04:54.510 --> 00:04:56.690
We use something for Axios.

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:57.310
First,

00:04:57.310 --> 00:04:58.410
let's use the fetch,

00:04:58.410 --> 00:04:58.980
Abia.

00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:05.330
So you take your fetch and then type in a You are which is gonna be http.

00:05:05.330 --> 00:05:13.280
Colon double slash local host 4000 slash contacts the 50 p a.

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:14.930
Retton's promise.

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.230
And when it is resolved,

00:05:16.230 --> 00:05:19.620
we get the actual response and the response.

00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:20.660
If we log,

00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.720
you'll see that it is an actual response.

00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:27.760
Object if you go back to the closer And if you press f 12 Togo,

00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.690
the developer concern you see that the response object exists.

00:05:30.690 --> 00:05:33.960
The response object has many functionalities here.

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:36.730
One of the function here is called Jason,

00:05:36.730 --> 00:05:40.620
which can be called when you know that the response is j fun.

00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:44.460
So what I do is when we get that response instead of doing a console log,

00:05:44.460 --> 00:05:45.400
I'm your savior.

00:05:45.400 --> 00:05:46.710
Lester.

00:05:46.710 --> 00:05:52.300
Dr Jason the rest Or Jason also returns a promise so we can do a statement.

00:05:52.300 --> 00:05:52.710
Cheney.

00:05:52.710 --> 00:05:55.410
We say that they when less dark Jason,

00:05:55.410 --> 00:05:58.590
it's called what other promise you get when that is result.

00:05:58.590 --> 00:06:00.120
We actually get the data,

00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:05.720
and we just want to console love the later Now save this.

00:06:05.720 --> 00:06:10.860
And if I go back to the browser now will see that there is an a day off 50 contacts over

00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:11.340
here.

00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:11.900
What?

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:12.530
I can do it.

00:06:12.530 --> 00:06:16.190
I can take this data and store that as part of my state.

00:06:16.190 --> 00:06:17.180
For example,

00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:20.530
Imagine if I have contacts is an initial empty.

00:06:20.530 --> 00:06:23.630
I cannot change the state by typing.

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:24.090
Here.

00:06:24.090 --> 00:06:25.440
This starts set.

00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:29.830
State off contacts is nothing but data.

00:06:29.830 --> 00:06:35.690
And now the state has a contact which is gonna be an area off 50 contacts and just ratify.

00:06:35.690 --> 00:06:40.260
Let's also all put the number off contacts initially and later point in time.

00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:46.880
I'm gonna take a paragraph and in curly black and I'll say this starts ST dot contacts.

00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:50.740
Thoughtful lead contacts exists.

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:53.760
So if you save this and go back to the browser,

00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:55.650
you will see that it is 50.

00:06:55.650 --> 00:06:56.780
Contacts exists.

00:06:56.780 --> 00:06:59.370
Now that we have this 50 contacts,

00:06:59.370 --> 00:07:00.740
we would like to pass this toe.

00:07:00.740 --> 00:07:01.870
Another component.

00:07:01.870 --> 00:07:03.680
Let's call it has contact list.

00:07:03.680 --> 00:07:07.880
Let's create a new five year contract list for Chase,

00:07:07.880 --> 00:07:08.990
and there's going to be a simple,

00:07:08.990 --> 00:07:10.370
stateless component.

00:07:10.370 --> 00:07:18.630
I think I am are toe just import the react and say your constant contact list equals two.

00:07:18.630 --> 00:07:21.210
Let's say we receive all the props,

00:07:21.210 --> 00:07:27.650
but I'm only interested in the context from the Bronx equals toe some j six.

00:07:27.650 --> 00:07:34.030
And I'm just gonna put a do slash do I didn't take the do.

00:07:34.030 --> 00:07:38.250
I'm gonna transform contacts into something else.

00:07:38.250 --> 00:07:41.680
Using the map where the map function takes a callback,

00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:48.460
the callback receives a single contact object and were written a new contact car with

00:07:48.460 --> 00:07:55.870
contact is C We don't give key equals toe CR me because this is going to be an array off

00:07:55.870 --> 00:07:58.640
context on the guard is not important.

00:07:58.640 --> 00:07:59.650
So that's important.

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:04.210
Import contact car from dot,

00:08:04.210 --> 00:08:05.570
slash contact card.

00:08:05.570 --> 00:08:07.960
So we have a very simple,

00:08:07.960 --> 00:08:14.470
stateless component that is gonna display deal that Dave is gonna contain an off contract

00:08:14.470 --> 00:08:22.590
cards based on unusual contact objects that also export this as the default member off our

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:23.130
model.

00:08:23.130 --> 00:08:24.150
Save this.

00:08:24.150 --> 00:08:26.270
Go back to the index.

00:08:26.270 --> 00:08:27.050
Georgie s.

00:08:27.050 --> 00:08:29.620
We can now make use of this contact list here.

00:08:29.620 --> 00:08:33.800
So by typing in the first column off my deal,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.560
I'm gonna used a contact list and not be escorted,

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:43.960
helping me by automatically important that on the contact list were supposed to supply the

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:46.260
contacts as an attribute.

00:08:46.260 --> 00:08:48.350
So come down on tape here.

00:08:48.350 --> 00:08:55.850
Foreign tax equals to the a day which is made it by his start state start contact.

00:08:55.850 --> 00:08:57.430
Save this.

00:08:57.430 --> 00:08:59.820
And if I go back to the browser,

00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:04.330
we should not see the list off all the contacts that we have 50 off them.

00:09:04.330 --> 00:09:05.750
They're listed over here.
