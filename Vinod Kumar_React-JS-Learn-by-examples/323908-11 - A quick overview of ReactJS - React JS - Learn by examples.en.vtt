00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.400
Let's have a quick overview off what is re actress and some off its key elements.

00:00:04.400 --> 00:00:07.440
Regis is an open source Java script,

00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:12.070
literally for building user interfaces that run on roses and smartphones.

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:15.200
It was delivered in 2011 by Jordan.

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:22.530
Walk Us after engineer it Facebook and was made open source in 2030 really can be used as a

00:00:22.530 --> 00:00:25.860
base in the development off single bitch on mobile applications.

00:00:25.860 --> 00:00:26.910
However,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:32.290
complex react applications usually required the use off additional libraries for state

00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:33.020
management.

00:00:33.020 --> 00:00:35.580
Routing on interaction with GPS,

00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:39.630
developers often call it as the V in M V C.

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:43.210
The basic building block off the react application is a component.

00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:49.120
A component is more like a user different html element that is typically made up off a

00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:52.430
combination off HTML elements on other components.

00:00:52.430 --> 00:00:56.960
A component can be created using either a class generally known as hateful.

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:59.540
Components are using a function,

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:02.700
and such components are called Are Stateless Cos.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:03.920
If it's a class,

00:01:03.920 --> 00:01:06.980
then it must have defined a function called us render,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.780
which would then return the HTML slipper corresponding to the U.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:11.060
I.

00:01:11.060 --> 00:01:13.120
In a strict XML syntax,

00:01:13.120 --> 00:01:16.050
the same thing applies to the stateless component as well.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:21.510
A state full component may contain data with the generally tone does the state and may

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:24.150
define member functions to handle you.

00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:28.950
Events such as portent licks under the court looks like Jabba State,

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.450
since we combine XML and Jealous Dude,

00:01:31.450 --> 00:01:34.560
it's called JSX are JavaScript XML.

00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:36.170
In a reactor application.

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:40.960
Apparent component can pass values to child components using what's called US props.

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:43.920
These are like HTML elements attributes.

00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.750
The props are immutable,

00:01:45.750 --> 00:01:50.400
which means changes to a prop in the child component does not affect the parent.

00:01:50.400 --> 00:01:51.970
In a state full component,

00:01:51.970 --> 00:01:55.560
you can access these props using the building member card.

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.720
This start props.

00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.490
However,

00:01:57.490 --> 00:01:58.750
in a stateless component,

00:01:58.750 --> 00:02:04.920
you do not have access to the this Cavor and all the props are assumed as a single function

00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:05.550
perimeter.

00:02:05.550 --> 00:02:09.930
One last thing to remember is that the name of the component must begin with an uppercase

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.370
letter.

00:02:10.370 --> 00:02:11.560
Otherwise,

00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.250
you will get a compilation better
