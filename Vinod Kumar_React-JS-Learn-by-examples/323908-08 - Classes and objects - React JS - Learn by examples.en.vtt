00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.950
around the year.

00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:01.510
Six.

00:00:01.510 --> 00:00:04.340
Working with object oriented programming in JavaScript.

00:00:04.340 --> 00:00:04.810
WAAS.

00:00:04.810 --> 00:00:05.060
Very,

00:00:05.060 --> 00:00:05.930
very difficult.

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:10.510
But with here six creating classes using inheritance,

00:00:10.510 --> 00:00:12.090
etcetera have become very,

00:00:12.090 --> 00:00:12.810
very simple.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:15.190
Let's have a look at the same thing using an example.

00:00:15.190 --> 00:00:19.010
So I'm gonna clear the new file fee eg 09 torture years.

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:26.410
And here I can just use a class keeper and clear a class for person just like this.

00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:27.630
Now,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:28.340
remember,

00:00:28.340 --> 00:00:32.950
JavaScript is a prototypical object oriented programming language,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:36.960
which means there is no class structure behind the scene.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.610
This will be converted into a function on those functions will be considered as

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:42.550
constructors.

00:00:42.550 --> 00:00:43.660
In any case,

00:00:43.660 --> 00:00:45.820
we can simply create a class person.

00:00:45.820 --> 00:00:46.630
And then I can say,

00:00:46.630 --> 00:00:50.730
Let me one equals two person like this.

00:00:50.730 --> 00:00:51.200
And of course,

00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:53.090
I can always stay your console lot.

00:00:53.090 --> 00:00:57.030
Type off the one and it should say it's a class person.

00:00:57.030 --> 00:00:58.360
So if I save this,

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:05.410
go back to the command front Northey eg 09 and it says it and object because if I simply

00:01:05.410 --> 00:01:06.850
friend what sp one,

00:01:06.850 --> 00:01:10.800
I should be able to see that it's an object off person.

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.610
So it's an object off person or here If you want to declare member variables,

00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:22.410
what it can do is you can create a constructor first on,

00:01:22.410 --> 00:01:24.030
then in the constructor Rick,

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:27.360
and say they start name equals an empty strength.

00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:31.830
This start city because toe probably Cingular as the default.

00:01:31.830 --> 00:01:33.480
And then if you go on one,

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:39.960
the theme you should now see that it is person object with name and city as two properties

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:39.960
.

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:45.180
You can also make use of the constructor here to receive the perimeters,

00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:45.850
for example,

00:01:45.850 --> 00:01:50.450
I can say your name and then city equals toe angular.

00:01:50.450 --> 00:01:55.320
So this is another feature in year six,

00:01:55.320 --> 00:02:00.470
we reckon assigned default values your perimeter so that I can assign name,

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:00.920
toe,

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.260
distort name and city toe distort city.

00:02:04.260 --> 00:02:05.530
Save this.

00:02:05.530 --> 00:02:06.130
Now,

00:02:06.130 --> 00:02:06.840
for P one,

00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:08.650
there is no values,

00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:14.120
but as far let me two equals two new person off we note on.

00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:15.560
If I don't supply anything,

00:02:15.560 --> 00:02:17.260
it's gonna be a Bangor anyways.

00:02:17.260 --> 00:02:19.000
But if I also have your leg,

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:23.110
p three equals toe person off John on.

00:02:23.110 --> 00:02:27.610
That's a Dallas print the tool.

00:02:27.610 --> 00:02:28.190
Andi,

00:02:28.190 --> 00:02:29.950
think Petri.

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:31.250
Save this.

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.720
Go back on trial in the same thing.

00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.540
You'll see now that the objects have different values because we're able to supply where

00:02:39.540 --> 00:02:40.890
constructors get.

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:44.440
If you want to declare member functions over here,

00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:48.440
you can always add a function without the function keeper.

00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:51.390
I can simply say you're French in four,

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:53.280
and then I can see your concern.

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.300
Lock name equals to his dark name,

00:02:57.300 --> 00:03:02.220
and then I can say control off city people's to this dark city.

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:03.030
Now,

00:03:03.030 --> 00:03:06.080
instead of using the pencil log using T one t two in this way,

00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:13.820
I can say we want our friend in Four people are killed in four as we speak without in form

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:13.820
,

00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:16.760
so the president for is a member function,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:19.400
and we can call them using the objects here.

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:24.900
So go back from the same thing and you can see now I'm able to get the details off.

00:03:24.900 --> 00:03:27.300
Each of the person's people didn't have a name,

00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:29.650
so it's an undefined on between Pete.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.770
We have name and city as well.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:35.340
If you want to create a trance that inherit from another class,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:39.390
you can do that with the extent ski world like in Java,

00:03:39.390 --> 00:03:41.950
70 cleared another example for sure the same thing.

00:03:41.950 --> 00:03:52.150
So here as a class person which has got a constructor and in the constructor and giving a

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:59.080
couple of members and say this dot name You can always design if you want undefined this

00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:03.370
door city equals toe undefined are if you want,

00:04:03.370 --> 00:04:06.790
you can receive those things from the constructor just like the previous.

00:04:06.790 --> 00:04:07.640
But for the time being,

00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:09.730
I'm gonna just use undefined.

00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:11.570
You can create another class,

00:04:11.570 --> 00:04:12.560
for example,

00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:16.210
employees and I get the extents person.

00:04:16.210 --> 00:04:16.610
Now,

00:04:16.610 --> 00:04:18.350
when you use inheritance,

00:04:18.350 --> 00:04:21.350
there is one small aspect that you keep in mind.

00:04:21.350 --> 00:04:25.910
So the constructor must call the super class construction.

00:04:25.910 --> 00:04:27.920
This is a must.

00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:33.160
So we thought that it's going to give an editor and it has to be used before any other

00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:34.880
statements in your constructor.

00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.310
So,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:35.870
for example,

00:04:35.870 --> 00:04:39.910
and said this starts salary equals toe 45,000.

00:04:39.910 --> 00:04:43.500
Visit our department equals toe,

00:04:43.500 --> 00:04:44.950
probably undefined.

00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:54.690
So come down here and then I can say clearly a variable called even which is a new

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:55.540
employees.

00:04:55.540 --> 00:04:56.140
And then,

00:04:56.140 --> 00:04:58.030
if I type your consoled outlaw,

00:04:58.030 --> 00:05:00.610
even save this and go back,

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:08.470
you should now see that even is an employer object.

00:05:08.470 --> 00:05:11.210
It has named city salary on the department.

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.820
All the members are there.

00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:15.840
So in Calif I do not do this,

00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:19.060
then that's going to lead to a problem and it dimension.

00:05:19.060 --> 00:05:19.630
Anyway.

00:05:19.630 --> 00:05:25.310
You can see that it is monster called Super Constructor in delight.

00:05:25.310 --> 00:05:25.720
Plus,

00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:30.510
before accessing this are returning from dinner constructor you get.

00:05:30.510 --> 00:05:32.680
If you didn't have the constructor at all,

00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:34.120
that's not a problem.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:39.790
So the problem is only when the direct class constructor uses some statement toe assigned

00:05:39.790 --> 00:05:40.110
that so,

00:05:40.110 --> 00:05:40.630
for example,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:41.110
noisy.

00:05:41.110 --> 00:05:42.230
It has no problem.

00:05:42.230 --> 00:05:42.830
But of course,

00:05:42.830 --> 00:05:45.030
Salvia department are missing something.

00:05:45.030 --> 00:05:48.180
Just undo that on uncommitted the same.
