00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.910
a single bit application is a Web application that interaction a user by dynamically

00:00:06.910 --> 00:00:11.500
relating the current pitch content rather than loading entire new pages from the cellar.

00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:17.240
This approach a wide interruption of the user experience between successive pages,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.620
making the application behave like a desktop application in a single page application,

00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:25.170
either all necessary core like HTML,

00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:29.210
JavaScript and CSS are retired in a single page load.

00:00:29.210 --> 00:00:34.810
Are the appropriate resources are dynamically loaded and added to the page as necessary,

00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:37.170
usually in response to user actions.

00:00:37.170 --> 00:00:40.550
The page does not reload at any point in the process,

00:00:40.550 --> 00:00:43.390
nor does control transferred on the case at all.

00:00:43.390 --> 00:00:47.010
Take a look at this website bite under arc.

00:00:47.010 --> 00:00:48.870
I have few links over here.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:55.430
Clicking on any off these links will really the entire page by getting the new content from

00:00:55.430 --> 00:00:56.100
the server.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:00.040
So if you go to the documentation paid our kick on docks over here,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:07.240
you can observe that the page gets reloaded over here on the country.

00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:08.510
If I goto g made,

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:09.910
you'll see that the U.

00:01:09.910 --> 00:01:12.640
R L has two parts one before the hash,

00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:13.900
which is actually Orel.

00:01:13.900 --> 00:01:15.860
And then there is a part of the Ural,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:20.080
which identifies what should be displayed in this main content area.

00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:21.800
So since it says Inbox here,

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.600
I'm seeing the current inbox content.

00:01:23.600 --> 00:01:26.370
But if you go to the started section here,

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:28.660
you'll see that it is hash star.

00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:31.190
It's supposed to show me the star emails.

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:32.500
However,

00:01:32.500 --> 00:01:35.710
the actual peace does not real or on takeoff any off this.

00:01:35.710 --> 00:01:36.210
For example,

00:01:36.210 --> 00:01:38.270
if you go to the sent items over here,

00:01:38.270 --> 00:01:41.600
you'll see that the actual page did not refresh.

00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:44.500
It changes over here to say hash sent,

00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:46.770
and I see the sent emails over here.

00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:47.740
Likewise,

00:01:47.740 --> 00:01:48.890
the span as well.

00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:50.440
Here is another example.

00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:51.780
This is my website,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:56.730
you know dot co and if you see that there are lots off content over here.

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:02.930
But the content below this black color bar is something that dynamically changes based on

00:02:02.930 --> 00:02:04.180
my menu options.

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:04.760
For example,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:08.320
if I select this courses and click on Jerry busy programming,

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:10.650
you'll see that the page doesn't refresh.

00:02:10.650 --> 00:02:12.750
But the content got changed.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:17.270
Like where the first select resources online training I get back.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:19.780
I goto Jason Winter.

00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.290
You'll see that the actual content is getting changed,

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:26.660
but I do not see a hash symbol over here.

00:02:26.660 --> 00:02:27.640
Generally,

00:02:27.640 --> 00:02:30.670
this is identifying us a roadside resource,

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.920
but in my case,

00:02:31.920 --> 00:02:36.590
this is actually identified as a resource on the climb side itself.

00:02:36.590 --> 00:02:42.250
Which means the JavaScript library that is loaded over here identifies this particular part

00:02:42.250 --> 00:02:45.050
and then Lords and Appropriate Content door here,

00:02:45.050 --> 00:02:47.230
making it a single payer application.

00:02:47.230 --> 00:02:51.770
Now the reason you call this a single page application is because when the website is

00:02:51.770 --> 00:02:52.320
loaded,

00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:57.490
the only HTML that is loaded is the index html and then our words.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:02:59.370
It is the combination of Jolla Scripts,

00:02:59.370 --> 00:03:01.370
CSS and HTML snippets,

00:03:01.370 --> 00:03:03.930
which actually lords different components.

00:03:03.930 --> 00:03:05.380
On this particular section.

00:03:05.380 --> 00:03:09.380
Three edges does not support the single page applications out of the box.

00:03:09.380 --> 00:03:10.290
However,

00:03:10.290 --> 00:03:15.580
there are other additional tools that can be used to convert reactors application into a

00:03:15.580 --> 00:03:20.150
single page application toe converter reactors application into a single bit application.

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:23.900
We make use off this package car react,

00:03:23.900 --> 00:03:24.730
motor down,

00:03:24.730 --> 00:03:25.760
and it's very,

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:26.730
very simple.

00:03:26.730 --> 00:03:29.540
What we'll do is we'll convert our application here,

00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:33.860
which is the reactor looks demo application into a single bit application.

00:03:33.860 --> 00:03:38.360
So we're gonna get it off this form on this particular list instead,

00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:38.970
on the left shape,

00:03:38.970 --> 00:03:39.780
we're gonna have a side.

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:43.630
But with options like at a new contact view,

00:03:43.630 --> 00:03:46.950
all contacts are probably a home page link,

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:47.650
etcetera,

00:03:47.650 --> 00:03:51.840
clicking on which the other part should change dynamically.

00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.550
So let's go back to our results to be in court,

00:03:54.550 --> 00:03:57.150
where I have the indexed RJ's open,

00:03:57.150 --> 00:04:01.650
and this is the last change that we did with the religious application.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:08.660
What we want to do first is toe install the react rotor down so I can open a command prompt

00:04:08.660 --> 00:04:17.450
from view on dense a terminal and add a new terminal over here and then savior NPM Install

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:18.700
React,

00:04:18.700 --> 00:04:19.940
wrote Don.

00:04:19.940 --> 00:04:22.780
And once it is done,

00:04:22.780 --> 00:04:26.870
let's close this terminal and let's do a couple of imports.

00:04:26.870 --> 00:04:34.670
The first import that I wanna do is what scored as a hash rotor or Broza Rhoda Hash Older

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:38.100
allows us to use this technique where we use the hash,

00:04:38.100 --> 00:04:44.110
followed by a part and a browser rotor will allow us to use something like this with all

00:04:44.110 --> 00:04:44.740
the hash.

00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:49.210
And if you want to switch between the hash older and the browser voter,

00:04:49.210 --> 00:04:51.990
you can always include something like this,

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:56.150
import from react rotor down,

00:04:56.150 --> 00:05:01.420
what we want to import is something like hash rotor as rotor.

00:05:01.420 --> 00:05:05.190
So now I can change this to browser order if I want.

00:05:05.190 --> 00:05:08.290
And I can still use Rotor as an alias for that.

00:05:08.290 --> 00:05:09.600
For the time being,

00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.240
I'm gonna keep it as hash older.

00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.950
That's come down here.

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:17.210
The entire route element can be surrounded with this.

00:05:17.210 --> 00:05:23.550
Roeder are I can have it inside the provider surrounding this do so.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:28.720
I'm gonna do that by typing here rotor and then the slash order.

00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.680
After this deal,

00:05:29.680 --> 00:05:31.500
save this.

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.260
And if I go back to the browser No,

00:05:33.260 --> 00:05:36.290
you will see cash is added over here in.

00:05:36.290 --> 00:05:37.050
However,

00:05:37.050 --> 00:05:40.320
if I had used the browser rotor instead of the hash shorter,

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:43.750
I will not be seeing that hash when the pages refreshed.

00:05:43.750 --> 00:05:45.630
Now let's come down here.

00:05:45.630 --> 00:05:46.180
Well,

00:05:46.180 --> 00:05:46.670
first,

00:05:46.670 --> 00:05:49.470
alter the size off these to do's right now.

00:05:49.470 --> 00:05:50.860
Both of them have the same bridge,

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:55.190
So I'm gonna say that Dash MD Dash four on here.

00:05:55.190 --> 00:05:57.910
Amethi Dash MD Dash eight,

00:05:57.910 --> 00:06:00.450
making the 12 grade columns.

00:06:00.450 --> 00:06:02.450
So if I say this and go back,

00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:04.880
you will see that the sizes have been Artur.

00:06:04.880 --> 00:06:05.350
Now,

00:06:05.350 --> 00:06:06.620
instead of this form here,

00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.810
I want a sidebar And instead of this,

00:06:08.810 --> 00:06:10.830
I want actual content to be displayed.

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:17.650
So I'm gonna get off this contact form from here and contact lists from here and here.

00:06:17.650 --> 00:06:22.510
I'm gonna have a u l l a combination because we want to have a bunch of options.

00:06:22.510 --> 00:06:24.130
One more trick I want to show you.

00:06:24.130 --> 00:06:26.940
Here is the use off Emmett Syntax.

00:06:26.940 --> 00:06:27.540
For example,

00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:33.510
if I want to say you really dot list dash group And I want this to automatically generate a

00:06:33.510 --> 00:06:35.650
UL with a class name off this group,

00:06:35.650 --> 00:06:42.550
then if you want to do that so you have to first change This job was kept here toe the act

00:06:42.550 --> 00:06:43.550
jobless fruit.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:45.710
So I select that now,

00:06:45.710 --> 00:06:56.240
if I type your ul dot list dash group having your life dot list dash group dash item and I

00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.660
want a tree off them.

00:06:57.660 --> 00:06:58.570
So I pressed.

00:06:58.570 --> 00:06:59.180
Enter.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:01.950
You can see now I gotta ul like combination.

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:06.090
The 1st 1 I want to give here as something like home.

00:07:06.090 --> 00:07:15.720
2nd 1 probably is toe Add a new contract and add a new contract Year on the 3rd 1 is view

00:07:15.720 --> 00:07:17.160
all contacts.

00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:18.730
Save this.

00:07:18.730 --> 00:07:22.790
If you go back to the browser and I would see that we have a nice sidebar.

00:07:22.790 --> 00:07:23.740
But of course,

00:07:23.740 --> 00:07:27.540
there's no many options over here that I cannot click on any off these stuffs,

00:07:27.540 --> 00:07:29.840
and there is nothing being despaired over here.

00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:33.010
We don't have anything to display for home.

00:07:33.010 --> 00:07:38.120
So it's clear that component that represents the whole and we already have our new contact

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:39.310
and view all contacts.

00:07:39.310 --> 00:07:40.950
I can get that over here straight away.

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:42.190
To do that,

00:07:42.190 --> 00:07:44.530
you have to first include a couple of things.

00:07:44.530 --> 00:07:52.100
Number one is a link so that we can add a hyperlink toe our menu options.

00:07:52.100 --> 00:07:54.960
The second is an option called wrote.

00:07:54.960 --> 00:08:01.390
This defines where the component to be placed when a link is clicked so we can come down

00:08:01.390 --> 00:08:01.800
here,

00:08:01.800 --> 00:08:10.820
toe this section and we can define a route here and then say particles toe slash Our new

00:08:10.820 --> 00:08:17.350
conduct component equals toe in curly bracket as a contact form,

00:08:17.350 --> 00:08:19.590
and that's the class that we won't be.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:20.000
Instead,

00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.460
she it We also may have to specify exact equals.

00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:25.740
Two true or false,

00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:27.820
the meaning off exactly concert,

00:08:27.820 --> 00:08:32.990
true or false is that should this be part of the part are the entire part should be equals

00:08:32.990 --> 00:08:34.570
to this so far,

00:08:34.570 --> 00:08:35.150
This it is.

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:35.850
Okay,

00:08:35.850 --> 00:08:41.020
so I'm gonna make a copy off this and faced and I will also get it off the side.

00:08:41.020 --> 00:08:43.530
But and then I'll say your view,

00:08:43.530 --> 00:08:46.370
all contacts as another.

00:08:46.370 --> 00:08:53.350
And that should actually bring up contact list component.

00:08:53.350 --> 00:08:54.420
Now,

00:08:54.420 --> 00:08:55.050
of course,

00:08:55.050 --> 00:09:01.170
this section will be populated with either a contact form our contact list only if the Ural

00:09:01.170 --> 00:09:02.080
has this part.

00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:02.690
For example,

00:09:02.690 --> 00:09:03.690
if I save this,

00:09:03.690 --> 00:09:07.250
go back to the browser and then if I go manually,

00:09:07.250 --> 00:09:09.350
type here as add new contact,

00:09:09.350 --> 00:09:13.820
you'll see that I get the our new contact form and then instead of this and say,

00:09:13.820 --> 00:09:15.230
view all contacts.

00:09:15.230 --> 00:09:16.670
I see the contacts.

00:09:16.670 --> 00:09:23.100
If I want to associate this list item to a form here and this to the contact list,

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:26.120
this is where we're gonna use the link A tag.

00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:34.100
So we're gonna surround this with the link as a tag here and then there two equals toe add

00:09:34.100 --> 00:09:35.450
new contact,

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:38.140
slash link in between.

00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:39.280
I'm gonna pay the text.

00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:43.630
So this is gonna be eventually converted into a hyperlink by the address.

00:09:43.630 --> 00:09:44.680
Likewise,

00:09:44.680 --> 00:09:54.760
I'm no cactus from here for the link to it goes toe slash view all contacts and in between

00:09:54.760 --> 00:09:55.070
view,

00:09:55.070 --> 00:09:58.000
all contacts safe a safe this and go back to the closer.

00:09:58.000 --> 00:09:58.640
You know,

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.870
see that there is a hyperlink over here taking on this.

00:10:01.870 --> 00:10:04.680
We get one component taking on this,

00:10:04.680 --> 00:10:06.050
we get another component.

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:11.540
We can also say that connected on this home I want to get the home component are welcome

00:10:11.540 --> 00:10:12.650
page or something like that.

00:10:12.650 --> 00:10:15.500
So we can clear a simple home component,

00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:24.170
something like this that they const poll equals toe against a promise that should render a

00:10:24.170 --> 00:10:25.090
component.

00:10:25.090 --> 00:10:33.330
Someone take your a deal inside the do I'm gonna have a history and say you're welcome to

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.550
address book application.

00:10:36.550 --> 00:10:39.220
Probably a lot.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:43.250
And then probably a paragraph that is forward by.

00:10:43.250 --> 00:10:45.860
But he added,

00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:53.050
I have to use this home components I'm gonna come down here on and say you're that lean And

00:10:53.050 --> 00:10:55.010
I said two equals two slash.

00:10:55.010 --> 00:10:59.560
That means whenever you within the home page and then home here,

00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:04.210
this has to lure a component over here.

00:11:04.210 --> 00:11:07.310
I'm gonna come down here and then die route,

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:13.200
but equals o slash and then as a component equals two home.

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:14.180
Now,

00:11:14.180 --> 00:11:16.190
this will have a small problem.

00:11:16.190 --> 00:11:18.230
So I'll show you that and then solve this.

00:11:18.230 --> 00:11:20.340
Go back to the browser.

00:11:20.340 --> 00:11:25.410
The home component has been displayed even for view all contacts.

00:11:25.410 --> 00:11:27.610
Even if I click on add new contact,

00:11:27.610 --> 00:11:32.430
I still see that The reason is we mapped toe this one.

00:11:32.430 --> 00:11:37.680
So we said slash So also we say that whenever there is a slash in your part,

00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.550
this component has to be displayed on the slash is there here.

00:11:42.550 --> 00:11:44.760
But in addition to that,

00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.660
we have something else.

00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:51.070
So we want to say that only if it exactly matches to slash Then you display the home

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:56.580
component and that is they will simply come here and then are your exact either you can

00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:58.290
just leave it at that Oregon.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:02.160
Say true to say that this is an exact match.

00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:02.940
Save this.

00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:05.030
Go back to the closer now and see.

00:12:05.030 --> 00:12:07.050
I don't see a home component.

00:12:07.050 --> 00:12:09.130
I see the contact form.

00:12:09.130 --> 00:12:10.000
I kick on this.

00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.960
I do not see that home component.

00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:13.140
What if I click on this?

00:12:13.140 --> 00:12:16.340
Now you'll see the regular home component as well.

00:12:16.340 --> 00:12:21.760
So that is the reason why exact is not really required for this because here I have this

00:12:21.760 --> 00:12:22.250
view,

00:12:22.250 --> 00:12:25.400
all contacts and this is not part of any other you are.

00:12:25.400 --> 00:12:27.110
But if you want,

00:12:27.110 --> 00:12:30.640
you can always are exact to all of these,

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:32.050
like this.

00:12:32.050 --> 00:12:36.830
Save this and go back on.

00:12:36.830 --> 00:12:37.840
There is no others.

00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:38.870
It still works,

00:12:38.870 --> 00:12:41.360
still works and still works.

00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:48.560
This is how easy it is to set up a single page application in the edges Before we conclude

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:48.560
.

00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:51.270
Let's also do one more thing instead of using a hash,

00:12:51.270 --> 00:12:54.240
daughter will use what's going browser loader.

00:12:54.240 --> 00:12:57.950
Someone remove this and then take your browser longer.

00:12:57.950 --> 00:13:01.080
Since I'm using the same alias here router,

00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:03.010
which is what I have used over here.

00:13:03.010 --> 00:13:05.240
There is no need to make any changes.

00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:07.760
I saved this and go back on.

00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.040
Let me reward this slash cash from here.

00:13:10.040 --> 00:13:13.210
So not that there is no hash at this point in time.

00:13:13.210 --> 00:13:14.280
I click on this.

00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:15.450
Add new contact.

00:13:15.450 --> 00:13:18.450
I still hear form no hash symbol year.

00:13:18.450 --> 00:13:19.640
I take on this,

00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:20.920
I still see my list,

00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:23.180
but I don't see a hash symbol over here.
