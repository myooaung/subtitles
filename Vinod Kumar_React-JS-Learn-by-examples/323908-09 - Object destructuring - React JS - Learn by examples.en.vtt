00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.950
year six introduced something called As a Object Restructuring.

00:00:03.950 --> 00:00:05.910
Ondo Demonstrate the same.

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:07.430
Let's take another example here.

00:00:07.430 --> 00:00:09.890
So he x 11 tortillas.

00:00:09.890 --> 00:00:12.770
It's what's technically the object here.

00:00:12.770 --> 00:00:22.230
So let me one equals to an object where I have name off the table note city spangler and

00:00:22.230 --> 00:00:25.150
even that they know that we know that call.

00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:28.510
So what if I want three variables called name,

00:00:28.510 --> 00:00:29.770
city and email,

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.460
which borrows the value from people?

00:00:32.460 --> 00:00:39.650
What I would be doing in the older versions of Job Oscar is I may say you're let name

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:44.740
equals toe anyone guarding him and then that city it goes toe,

00:00:44.740 --> 00:00:46.760
we want our city left.

00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:48.280
Email equals two people,

00:00:48.280 --> 00:00:49.130
not email.

00:00:49.130 --> 00:00:50.140
Now,

00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:54.510
instead of doing this lengthy style so I can simply say,

00:00:54.510 --> 00:00:58.620
let in curly bracket name come up email commode.

00:00:58.620 --> 00:01:04.950
City equals two p one so that I don't say it is an object with a number of properties.

00:01:04.950 --> 00:01:08.650
But we want only these properties from the object.

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:15.260
Now I can just go on type your come so long name and then copy.

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:15.500
Yes,

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:20.260
this toe Print the email on city Save this.

00:01:20.260 --> 00:01:21.900
Go back to the command.

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:29.270
Prompt Onda run north GX level and you will see that I'm able toe access the local

00:01:29.270 --> 00:01:30.560
variables Dame City,

00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.680
an email which are got their values from FEMA.

00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.150
Now,

00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:37.600
I guess if I do not want City,

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:39.210
I don't need to do this.

00:01:39.210 --> 00:01:44.920
I can simply say giving only the name and email from p one because we want maybe a very

00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:47.070
complex object with lots of properties.

00:01:47.070 --> 00:01:48.780
That's also fine.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:50.020
So I'm gonna run this,

00:01:50.020 --> 00:01:52.550
and this time it's gonna give name and email alone.

00:01:52.550 --> 00:01:57.470
I may also say give me a properly for country on what?

00:01:57.470 --> 00:01:59.820
That country doesn't exist in the one.

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:07.430
But if I copy paste this and print country here Since the one didn't have country soapy

00:02:07.430 --> 00:02:09.350
Wonder country is undefined,

00:02:09.350 --> 00:02:11.640
so this country will be undefined.

00:02:11.640 --> 00:02:12.990
So I'm gonna save this.

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:19.520
Go back after running and you can see the last awkward is undefined so that the structuring

00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:23.070
concept can also be applied on at is so we can see here.

00:02:23.070 --> 00:02:24.040
For example,

00:02:24.040 --> 00:02:28.400
left numbs equals toe a bunch off numbs randomly.

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:30.890
Now if I want Oh,

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:36.330
let's say the numbers 10 and 20 are the first to two numbers off this array.

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:38.560
Toby ascended to two variables.

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:44.310
I can always say you're left in script bracket n one n two equals two nuts.

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:45.020
Now,

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:45.850
this way,

00:02:45.850 --> 00:02:50.880
the first value from the area is copied to the first variable second value from the array.

00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:52.860
Stop it toe the second variable.

00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:59.960
So I type your consoled our love and one equals two and one and coffee is the same thing.

00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:01.950
Changes to and do.

00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:03.060
Save this.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:08.580
Go back to the command front on the same neck and see anyone and end to have been copied

00:03:08.580 --> 00:03:10.080
from the actual raid.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.420
Numbs Now,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:16.050
in case if you want the rest of them to be copied toe another variable.

00:03:16.050 --> 00:03:17.410
This is very confused.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:18.840
What's called Rest operator?

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:21.070
The triple dark operator the Southern.

00:03:21.070 --> 00:03:22.220
In the previous video,

00:03:22.220 --> 00:03:25.510
I can just put here people not and then holidays.

00:03:25.510 --> 00:03:29.550
Arrest comes on and off course I'm no copy.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:32.790
Paste the same and take your rest in numbs.

00:03:32.790 --> 00:03:34.160
Save this.

00:03:34.160 --> 00:03:40.030
Go back to the command front Try running this once more and you will see that anyone and

00:03:40.030 --> 00:03:41.990
toe have got the 1st 2 numbers.

00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:44.680
The rest of the numbers from the area have been copied.

00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.080
Toe rest mom's variable,

00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:48.560
the object,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.150
the structuring can also be used with function parameters to understand the same.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:54.620
Let's take another example.

00:03:54.620 --> 00:03:57.360
So I'm gonna create a new file years 12 out.

00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:57.950
Yes.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.710
Let's copy the object from the previous example.

00:04:00.710 --> 00:04:02.750
So I'm gonna copy this P one from there on.

00:04:02.750 --> 00:04:05.490
In case you don't work here on imagine.

00:04:05.490 --> 00:04:09.030
I have a function which requires name and city.

00:04:09.030 --> 00:04:12.070
Let's call it as a function Say hello.

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:15.310
Which needs name and city around.

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:16.280
Print a message.

00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:28.120
Something like Hello Dollars Name those whether in dollars city like this.

00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.520
So in order,

00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:30.190
call this.

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.970
I may have to supply your say hello everyone got name?

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:37.450
Be one dot city Save this.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:42.470
Go back to the command brunch North years 12 on until hello.

00:04:42.470 --> 00:04:44.910
We know how is whether in Bangor Well,

00:04:44.910 --> 00:04:49.820
whatever I want to supply be one because the 1 may have hundreds of properties.

00:04:49.820 --> 00:04:53.220
I want the name and city property toe be picked up from people.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:58.600
Now this is where you can simply surround these two variables to the college bracket like

00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.050
this.

00:04:59.050 --> 00:05:01.680
So be one either in their object.

00:05:01.680 --> 00:05:02.980
So this is an object.

00:05:02.980 --> 00:05:04.910
But since we're using at the time off,

00:05:04.910 --> 00:05:09.130
declaration of parameters These will be created as two separate variables.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:14.130
Name and city de structuring P one we wonder Name copy,

00:05:14.130 --> 00:05:14.830
toe me.

00:05:14.830 --> 00:05:17.530
Be one not city cop into city.

00:05:17.530 --> 00:05:18.750
So I save it.

00:05:18.750 --> 00:05:24.070
Go back to the command front around the same program and I should see the same as well.
