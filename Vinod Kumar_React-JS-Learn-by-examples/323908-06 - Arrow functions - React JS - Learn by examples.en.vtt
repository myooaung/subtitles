X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
just come to the function.

00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:06.670
Programming language on it allows us to define functions in many different ways.

00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:08.920
Let's have an example to understand the same.

00:00:08.920 --> 00:00:11.040
So first I'm in a clear and your file.

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:12.960
Years $05.

00:00:12.960 --> 00:00:21.580
Chairs in the first and simplest way of declaring a function is with a function key were

00:00:21.580 --> 00:00:23.240
like this function.

00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:23.880
Hello,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:25.180
Andi.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.640
Now I can return here a string,

00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:29.630
something like Hello would.

00:00:29.630 --> 00:00:32.350
And then you can call this function like this.

00:00:32.350 --> 00:00:34.430
Let s one equals two.

00:00:34.430 --> 00:00:35.070
Hello.

00:00:35.070 --> 00:00:39.300
Now written value of hollow is a cento s one a minute.

00:00:39.300 --> 00:00:39.970
Print on.

00:00:39.970 --> 00:00:41.210
So locked s one.

00:00:41.210 --> 00:00:42.390
Save this.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:43.230
Go back to the command.

00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:48.120
Prompt North GX 05 on we get this hollow words.

00:00:48.120 --> 00:00:54.820
So one thing jobs over here is that the function definition here can be kept even after

00:00:54.820 --> 00:00:56.000
these statements on.

00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.370
So now this is a peculiar because Jalisco lords all the function definitions even before

00:01:02.370 --> 00:01:03.840
the execution off this fine.

00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:04.660
So,

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:09.470
technically speaking that only two lines off executions here is the first line of execution

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:09.470
.

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:10.920
There's a second line of execution,

00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:13.010
so you won't before the execution is done.

00:01:13.010 --> 00:01:15.170
This has already been loaded into the William.

00:01:15.170 --> 00:01:17.030
So this still works.

00:01:17.030 --> 00:01:19.020
So if you go back and check the same,

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:20.500
you can see it says hello work.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.030
Let me bring it back to the beginning.

00:01:23.030 --> 00:01:30.040
Another way of defining a function is by using a variable and assigning an anonymous

00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.690
function So I can do the same thing by typing left breed equals toe function without any.

00:01:36.690 --> 00:01:39.650
So this is called anonymous function for a very simple reason.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.400
Because there is no name to dysfunction on their return.

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:44.550
Hello world.

00:01:44.550 --> 00:01:47.570
And then I can against they.

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:48.330
Let s true,

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:49.850
because toe greet.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.670
So this time breach is a variable representing a function and I'm calling their function

00:01:56.670 --> 00:02:02.600
and then assigning the return value toe stoop expended by typing concern Law s too.

00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.850
We did our good twice.

00:02:04.850 --> 00:02:07.550
But this time I cannot change the sequence.

00:02:07.550 --> 00:02:08.100
For example,

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:13.320
if I put this one and based it afterwards now the execution begins from here.

00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.300
So there's the first line of execution second line of execution,

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.020
four line of execution.

00:02:18.020 --> 00:02:19.090
But at this time,

00:02:19.090 --> 00:02:22.460
there is no function loaded in the medium called greet.

00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:24.420
So there are two functions in the medium.

00:02:24.420 --> 00:02:27.090
Number one is this number do is this,

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:29.410
but it's an anonymous function,

00:02:29.410 --> 00:02:31.130
so the great function doesn't exist.

00:02:31.130 --> 00:02:32.890
Hotline number 10 If you run this,

00:02:32.890 --> 00:02:34.140
it's gonna cause a problem.

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:39.690
So it would appear the screen call this normally a fear of fire and lay Number 10 has an

00:02:39.690 --> 00:02:40.290
error.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:41.660
Greed is not defined.

00:02:41.660 --> 00:02:45.750
So you're declaring available only at line number 14.

00:02:45.750 --> 00:02:48.100
So it cannot be access to climb number 10.

00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:53.490
So we'll bring it back and based it there are many places where you may have to pass

00:02:53.490 --> 00:02:56.910
functions As arguments to another functions.

00:02:56.910 --> 00:03:01.550
Consider the function car welcome that they function better.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.910
Come which prince?

00:03:03.910 --> 00:03:04.960
A welcome message.

00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:10.130
So I guess they welcome to reaction is training Save this.

00:03:10.130 --> 00:03:14.100
Imagine I want to print this repeatedly every one second.

00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:15.210
So what I can do that?

00:03:15.210 --> 00:03:15.410
Can you?

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:20.370
The building function called set interval on that takes two arguments.

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:24.790
The 1st 1 happens to be the game of the function and 2nd 1 is the duration.

00:03:24.790 --> 00:03:29.610
So I'll give it us 1000 indicating one second all 1000 significant.

00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:30.650
Save this.

00:03:30.650 --> 00:03:34.450
If I go back to the command around and take north exit of five,

00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:36.970
you'll see that the welcome message.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.750
No prints every one second.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.350
The only way I can stop at this time is control C and that stops the execution.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:48.920
So what has happened here is that I supplied a function to set into Well,

00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:50.710
I did not call the welcome.

00:03:50.710 --> 00:03:52.630
The welcome was called by second.

00:03:52.630 --> 00:03:52.930
Well,

00:03:52.930 --> 00:04:00.080
so we call this is a callback function because I concept into will set into will calls back

00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:01.670
the welcome function.

00:04:01.670 --> 00:04:03.040
In many cases,

00:04:03.040 --> 00:04:08.090
the operas off this welcome function is only to be supplied with the combat.

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:13.090
And later we will never call this so interrupt unnecessarily polluting the Veum with

00:04:13.090 --> 00:04:13.860
dysfunction,

00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:16.560
we can supply the actual function here itself.

00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:17.560
For example,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:21.320
I can cut this from here and instead of welcome over here,

00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:21.950
I can,

00:04:21.950 --> 00:04:23.920
based in that function dated.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:26.810
And also I don't need this name here.

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:27.810
I can remove this.

00:04:27.810 --> 00:04:29.030
In other words,

00:04:29.030 --> 00:04:33.290
we supply an anonymous function over here and then an enjoyable.

00:04:33.290 --> 00:04:39.450
So the first argument is a function that gets executed by setting duel for everyone.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:39.850
Second,

00:04:39.850 --> 00:04:46.800
save this and read on the program once more You will see that the execution works just like

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.590
the previous one.

00:04:47.590 --> 00:04:51.090
Let me press control C and exit this now Here.

00:04:51.090 --> 00:04:51.430
Six.

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:54.470
Introduce a simpler way off doing this,

00:04:54.470 --> 00:04:56.420
which is called Farrah Functions.

00:04:56.420 --> 00:04:58.210
In order to use the arrow function,

00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:59.760
just get it off this function,

00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:03.820
keyword and use an adult over here like this.

00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:04.730
Save this.

00:05:04.730 --> 00:05:06.660
Run this on.

00:05:06.660 --> 00:05:09.050
We should be able to get the same old food once more.

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:16.700
Let's compose you to come out now when you use arrow functions.

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:19.950
This act is a placeholder for perimeters.

00:05:19.950 --> 00:05:22.020
Since we don't have any parameters,

00:05:22.020 --> 00:05:24.250
we can just leave an empty bracket here.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:26.480
And this is the body of the function.

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.430
And if the body of the function is just a one expression on one statement,

00:05:32.430 --> 00:05:35.150
especially if that happens to be a return statement,

00:05:35.150 --> 00:05:39.520
you just have to give this without even giving the package.

00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:43.950
Are semi colon so I can remove that and place it like this.

00:05:43.950 --> 00:05:46.820
So now we see this is a function,

00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.630
but in a very simple expression,

00:05:49.630 --> 00:05:55.490
style saved this run this once more and we should get down could just like the same.

00:05:55.490 --> 00:06:03.040
There are many practical applications off this arrow functions.

00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.510
We'll take another example file to understand the same.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:16.300
So let me close this and create a new five Cartier 06 dot Js This time I want to feel and a

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.110
day off some names,

00:06:18.110 --> 00:06:19.220
for example,

00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:22.150
let names equals to an array off.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:27.860
You needs that they re not shampoo John and Ginny.

00:06:27.860 --> 00:06:32.480
Now this being an array,

00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:34.040
it has many functions.

00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:34.950
For example,

00:06:34.950 --> 00:06:37.040
there is a function called map,

00:06:37.040 --> 00:06:39.250
where for every element,

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:41.830
I can convert that into a different element.

00:06:41.830 --> 00:06:42.530
For example,

00:06:42.530 --> 00:06:47.200
if I want the first letters off each off these particular values,

00:06:47.200 --> 00:06:49.950
I can just type your name start man,

00:06:49.950 --> 00:06:52.910
which takes a function as a perimeter.

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:56.280
So the function is supposed to be like this,

00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:58.110
which refused of value.

00:06:58.110 --> 00:06:58.940
For example,

00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:02.790
I colored as well are reconciled need and then index.

00:07:02.790 --> 00:07:06.230
And then given this name and index,

00:07:06.230 --> 00:07:13.650
what do you want to return from there So I can say your returns Name Dog Cat effect zero

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:14.590
notice.

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:16.280
I'm not used the index here,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:17.500
but it's given to me.

00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:22.700
So map is a function that I call by supplying my own function.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:26.380
My function is called by map and it's for call back.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:28.930
Map gives me one name at a time,

00:07:28.930 --> 00:07:31.460
and I written instead of that name.

00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:33.550
I'm returning the first character of the knee.

00:07:33.550 --> 00:07:39.570
Each time the return value is collected by the map and eventually it will return an entire

00:07:39.570 --> 00:07:40.400
array itself.

00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:46.100
So I can say you're let cast equals two and then print the same thing.

00:07:46.100 --> 00:07:51.140
So I'm gonna take your concerned a lot of names on concerted love casts.

00:07:51.140 --> 00:07:52.280
Save this.

00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:59.360
Go back around this 6th 1 this time and you'll see that the first is my input,

00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:00.770
which is the names.

00:08:00.770 --> 00:08:04.050
2nd 1 is the first character off each one off them.

00:08:04.050 --> 00:08:06.590
So now that we have it on a map,

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:11.760
function in this style so we can simplify the same in another face on your copy this and

00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:13.990
paste over here on day,

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:17.630
change this function toe ara function.

00:08:17.630 --> 00:08:18.910
So to do so,

00:08:18.910 --> 00:08:20.670
I remove this function cable.

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:25.950
I keep these two parameters and I'll put them out of your And since there is a return

00:08:25.950 --> 00:08:26.850
statement here,

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:32.780
I can simply copy what is the return value on then substitute for the entire function body

00:08:32.780 --> 00:08:33.710
like this.

00:08:33.710 --> 00:08:36.060
So now we see it looks pretty simple.

00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.560
If you observe,

00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:39.390
I've never used this index,

00:08:39.390 --> 00:08:40.400
so I don't need that.

00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:43.960
And since there is only one perimeter.

00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:45.610
I don't need the black it either.

00:08:45.610 --> 00:08:46.480
Samuel,

00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:47.530
remove the bracket.

00:08:47.530 --> 00:08:49.330
And now it looks so simple.

00:08:49.330 --> 00:08:53.430
That name start map Do you wanna name?

00:08:53.430 --> 00:08:55.400
I'm returning the first character off the name.

00:08:55.400 --> 00:08:57.280
So this can be read so simple.

00:08:57.280 --> 00:09:02.410
Let's bring this by using council lost cats once more and save this.

00:09:02.410 --> 00:09:03.730
Go back to the command front,

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.620
Run this once more You can see that we have the exact same or court.

00:09:07.620 --> 00:09:09.700
Whether I used a complex,

00:09:09.700 --> 00:09:12.080
lengthy function are a simple,

00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:13.670
out of function expression.

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:14.370
Similarly,

00:09:14.370 --> 00:09:18.390
if I want to find out the index off a string in the area,

00:09:18.390 --> 00:09:21.700
I can use something called names Don't find index,

00:09:21.700 --> 00:09:24.490
which takes a function as an argument.

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:25.240
Once again,

00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.560
the function will be given the value and they decks.

00:09:28.560 --> 00:09:32.520
And I have to return to our falls based on my condition.

00:09:32.520 --> 00:09:35.490
So if I'm searching for value like for example,

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:37.140
imagine I'm searching for John.

00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:42.230
I have a check of John is equal to this value that I have to say to if it is not,

00:09:42.230 --> 00:09:47.150
as I should say it on force and this function will be repeatedly called for every value

00:09:47.150 --> 00:09:50.830
within Dari whenever to one's returned by me.

00:09:50.830 --> 00:09:54.940
It will stop and find the index off there and give that value.

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:56.520
So all I have to do is to save it.

00:09:56.520 --> 00:10:00.100
Tough valued people equals to John.

00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:01.050
For example,

00:10:01.050 --> 00:10:04.260
since this is going to give me an index,

00:10:04.260 --> 00:10:06.710
let me declare available for index.

00:10:06.710 --> 00:10:08.870
But I can type your consoler law.

00:10:08.870 --> 00:10:15.990
John is found at index and then followed by the index,

00:10:15.990 --> 00:10:21.020
so obviously it's indexes to seminal save these around this once more.

00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:23.160
It's John is founded index to.

00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:25.100
And if I want to search for say,

00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:25.790
for example,

00:10:25.790 --> 00:10:27.510
Johnny instead of Johnson,

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:29.690
the changes both Jon Stewart,

00:10:29.690 --> 00:10:30.260
Johnny,

00:10:30.260 --> 00:10:31.460
which is not form.

00:10:31.460 --> 00:10:33.450
So if I say this and run this,

00:10:33.450 --> 00:10:40.530
you'll see that it is indexes minus one because Johnny is not form in my attic now.

00:10:40.530 --> 00:10:43.990
In orderto simplify our convert this into an arrow function,

00:10:43.990 --> 00:10:48.550
I will remove this and that stuff and simply type value arrow.

00:10:48.550 --> 00:10:51.690
And then I think value it calls.

00:10:51.690 --> 00:10:54.930
Two equals toe Johnny off.

00:10:54.930 --> 00:10:55.450
John,

00:10:55.450 --> 00:10:58.250
I don't need this bracket anymore.

00:10:58.250 --> 00:11:02.420
So now my fine index looks very,

00:11:02.420 --> 00:11:03.280
very simple.

00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:05.320
So given a value,

00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:05.910
I'm checking.

00:11:05.910 --> 00:11:09.850
If the value happens to be John whenever it is matched.

00:11:09.850 --> 00:11:11.750
It's gonna give the injection in calif.

00:11:11.750 --> 00:11:12.790
None of the values match,

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:13.250
John,

00:11:13.250 --> 00:11:14.950
that I'm gonna get minus one.

00:11:14.950 --> 00:11:17.380
Changes also to John saved this.

00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:22.850
Go back to the command front or on this once more and you can t John is founded index tube

00:11:22.850 --> 00:11:22.850
.
