00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
in modern,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:03.540
jealous good frameworks like angular or react,

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:05.600
you don't do don manipulation.

00:00:05.600 --> 00:00:06.180
Instead,

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:10.430
the frameworks do it for you whenever date amended by the framework changes.

00:00:10.430 --> 00:00:14.390
One of the main aspect of react is the so called war child on,

00:00:14.390 --> 00:00:17.950
because of which react applications are considerably fast.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:19.380
So is the browser.

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:20.250
Don't slow?

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:21.680
The answer is no.

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.010
The dome is fast adding,

00:00:24.010 --> 00:00:28.550
and removing Down Lords doesn't take much more than setting a property on the JavaScript

00:00:28.550 --> 00:00:29.200
object.

00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.690
It's a simple operation.

00:00:30.690 --> 00:00:31.810
What is slow,

00:00:31.810 --> 00:00:32.370
however,

00:00:32.370 --> 00:00:36.180
is the Leo that houses have to do whenever dark changes.

00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:42.150
Every time the dumb changes browser needs to re calculate the CSS toe the layered and

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:43.550
repaint the webpage,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:44.950
this is what takes time.

00:00:44.950 --> 00:00:46.990
Like the actual dome,

00:00:46.990 --> 00:00:52.660
the water down is a tree off north that lists elements and their attributes and the content

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.350
as objects and properties.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.540
The end of function of various component fears this tree off north from Riyadh components

00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:03.560
on update this tree in response to changes in the data model.

00:01:03.560 --> 00:01:09.230
Each time the underlying gator changes in a reactor up a new world Children representation

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:11.120
off the user interface is created.

00:01:11.120 --> 00:01:13.700
Now this is where things get interesting.

00:01:13.700 --> 00:01:18.650
Updating the browsers dunk is a three step process into yet Number one.

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:22.830
Whenever state or props changes the entire you,

00:01:22.830 --> 00:01:26.480
it will be really rendered in a virtual dom representation number.

00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.540
Do the difference between the previous virtual down representation on the new one will be

00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:32.370
calculated?

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:33.340
And finally,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:37.800
number three the real dumb will be updated with what has actually changed.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:42.500
This is very much like applying a patch to understand this concept.

00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:45.580
Let's create an app using plain money locale escaped.

00:01:45.580 --> 00:01:48.500
This is an app created using created,

00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:49.190
react up,

00:01:49.190 --> 00:01:52.850
See a line it just hasn't indexed or Jason the SRC,

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:56.000
nothing else on there also have ability and everything,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.150
and just for the council of saying it's working.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.630
And this is what currently showing what we're gonna do here is toe display hedge Juan Ondo

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:04.630
.

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:06.790
Periodically keep changing that,

00:02:06.790 --> 00:02:08.820
and every time we change us,

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:14.550
we will be able to see that the Tom it's really and in Google Chrome we can come to the

00:02:14.550 --> 00:02:16.400
council has escaped.

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.540
We see a small bar over here.

00:02:18.540 --> 00:02:24.070
Take on this three dots and there is something called rendering and we have an option going

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.560
paint flashing.

00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:29.420
Now what it does is it's gonna highlight the areas off your application,

00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:31.010
which is being repainted.

00:02:31.010 --> 00:02:38.750
Let's go to the Cornum and remove this and let's clear a hitch one with some content adding

00:02:38.750 --> 00:02:39.370
to the body.

00:02:39.370 --> 00:02:40.310
Now,

00:02:40.310 --> 00:02:43.000
since we're using plain one in La Jolla script,

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:43.990
let's clear this.

00:02:43.990 --> 00:02:52.030
Which one using document thought create element and which one we want to give an idea for

00:02:52.030 --> 00:02:53.500
this circuit say it's wondered.

00:02:53.500 --> 00:02:55.050
Set at three years off.

00:02:55.050 --> 00:02:58.130
I need you does killing one?

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:05.740
I will also add some in our HTML for the see Hello World and now let's add this to the body

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:11.550
by saying document dot qari selected off hash route.

00:03:11.550 --> 00:03:13.870
This is the deal in our indexed alleged email.

00:03:13.870 --> 00:03:16.470
Don't offend off each one.

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.510
Now if I save this Andi,

00:03:18.510 --> 00:03:19.930
come back to the browser.

00:03:19.930 --> 00:03:20.530
You should know.

00:03:20.530 --> 00:03:22.350
See that there is a hello world.

00:03:22.350 --> 00:03:22.920
Which one?

00:03:22.920 --> 00:03:25.710
You also saw that there was a green flash.

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.270
For example,

00:03:26.270 --> 00:03:27.340
If I refresh this,

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:30.830
you'll see that there is a green flash on the entire body.

00:03:30.830 --> 00:03:33.570
And then there was a brief flash on the H one.

00:03:33.570 --> 00:03:34.550
Let's go back.

00:03:34.550 --> 00:03:35.090
Um,

00:03:35.090 --> 00:03:35.470
excuse.

00:03:35.470 --> 00:03:41.720
The second dual function toe reappeared This particular which ones in a ridge dermal to the

00:03:41.720 --> 00:03:42.820
same text.

00:03:42.820 --> 00:03:44.970
Everyone second to do that,

00:03:44.970 --> 00:03:46.620
even if they said Interval,

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:51.630
it takes a call back as a pyramid of and then the duration.

00:03:51.630 --> 00:03:54.760
Let's give it us 1000 into getting one second.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:04:01.610
And in here I want to access this element whose idea is hitting one and then changes in our

00:04:01.610 --> 00:04:03.290
HTML to the same thing.

00:04:03.290 --> 00:04:11.520
So I'm gonna go and you're like h one equals toe document are why the selected off hash

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:12.250
heading one.

00:04:12.250 --> 00:04:17.050
So we don't get this heading one element as a local variable here.

00:04:17.050 --> 00:04:21.550
And then let's re apply this h one in a ridge dermal once again.

00:04:21.550 --> 00:04:28.230
And we'll also print that there is some update going on by using something like console

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:32.800
Long that they did the heady.

00:04:32.800 --> 00:04:37.750
Let's assume that we have some variable poor count which will increment every time.

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.420
And then I say times so we don't have this variable for count.

00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:46.150
Let's initialize this toe Com equals to one.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:49.630
Save this and if I come back to the browser,

00:04:49.630 --> 00:04:52.490
you will not see that it is sprinting here.

00:04:52.490 --> 00:04:56.790
And every time it is updating your Dom is also being repainted,

00:04:56.790 --> 00:04:58.290
even though actually,

00:04:58.290 --> 00:04:59.810
there is no change in the title.

00:04:59.810 --> 00:05:04.060
It is getting painted again and again because this is really don.

00:05:04.060 --> 00:05:11.130
Now let's read with the same thing using the reactors application and see if changing off

00:05:11.130 --> 00:05:13.920
the state which is supposed to display this fighting.

00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:16.390
Will it also repaint this every time?

00:05:16.390 --> 00:05:22.250
So let's go back to the core and let's get it off all these on we're gonna create area

00:05:22.250 --> 00:05:23.100
application.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.380
So I'm gonna say you're I am Marcy.

00:05:25.380 --> 00:05:26.600
To get that import,

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:31.010
I will also report the reactive dog from react down.

00:05:31.010 --> 00:05:35.480
We want to create that class based component so we can maintain some state.

00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:37.660
So I'm gonna say you're Sisi s,

00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:39.480
but that comes with an index.

00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.660
I want to change this toe.

00:05:40.660 --> 00:05:43.310
I also don't want to export this,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:44.380
But instead of interviews,

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.970
the reactor Tom on,

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.270
render this to our route,

00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:49.850
do in the index html.

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:52.150
So there's gonna be act like this,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:53.030
and then it Dave,

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.950
your document or either,

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.010
by re selector,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:58.050
If you're using quite a selector,

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.950
use the hash route.

00:05:59.950 --> 00:06:01.990
And if you're using,

00:06:01.990 --> 00:06:02.970
get a human body,

00:06:02.970 --> 00:06:05.660
you can just say route here is where I want to display.

00:06:05.660 --> 00:06:07.010
Probably a deal.

00:06:07.010 --> 00:06:12.500
And inside that their own would each one on a prototype here.

00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:15.780
This doubt stage dogs Dayton.

00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:26.560
And we will also add this variable called the title Seeing Hello would save this.

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.550
Go back to the browser and see if it is updated.

00:06:29.550 --> 00:06:30.900
And as you can see,

00:06:30.900 --> 00:06:33.450
that the brother has displayed that over here.

00:06:33.450 --> 00:06:35.530
Like in the previous example.

00:06:35.530 --> 00:06:41.010
We're gonna use the second trouble and change the fatal to the same text and see if it's

00:06:41.010 --> 00:06:42.280
going to repaint the dumb.

00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.590
So to do that,

00:06:43.590 --> 00:06:48.320
I'm gonna use the confident in the Mount Lifecycle function on here.

00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:50.200
I will say step Interval,

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:54.150
which takes a cold bath on the duration,

00:06:54.150 --> 00:06:57.300
which is gonna be 1000 milliseconds or one second.

00:06:57.300 --> 00:07:01.890
And here is a distort said state and then supplied,

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.340
titled the Word.

00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:09.370
And like in the previous example,

00:07:09.370 --> 00:07:14.530
I also want to be with counsel law displaying how many times it got incriminated for this

00:07:14.530 --> 00:07:14.970
interrupt.

00:07:14.970 --> 00:07:16.100
Using estate variable,

00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:18.110
Emily is a member variable year apart.

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:20.160
This s phone people's toe one on.

00:07:20.160 --> 00:07:20.790
Also,

00:07:20.790 --> 00:07:24.050
I want to say after the status changed,

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:27.440
I want o console love this summer.

00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.540
Use a comeback here,

00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:35.720
which is gonna do something like updated the league count.

00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:38.750
Plus plus times off course.

00:07:38.750 --> 00:07:41.340
This has to be this start counter plus.

00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:41.790
Plus,

00:07:41.790 --> 00:07:43.220
I saved this.

00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:47.650
Go back to the browser and you will see that first time it got a green.

00:07:47.650 --> 00:07:48.470
After that,

00:07:48.470 --> 00:07:49.800
it is changing the state,

00:07:49.800 --> 00:07:52.190
but it's not being repainted now,

00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:56.480
since the state is changing the content toe itself,

00:07:56.480 --> 00:07:59.480
we're not seeing any refresh on the brother.

00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:00.580
However,

00:08:00.580 --> 00:08:02.970
if I go back and change the title,

00:08:02.970 --> 00:08:05.140
then you should see the repainting that's gonna happen.

00:08:05.140 --> 00:08:07.730
So let's go back to the court.

00:08:07.730 --> 00:08:11.350
Will also add one more condition over here.

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:12.830
So in the second to well,

00:08:12.830 --> 00:08:15.020
we're gonna change the state anyways.

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:15.990
But for every fight,

00:08:15.990 --> 00:08:17.950
second will double the title.

00:08:17.950 --> 00:08:21.490
So we're gonna get the current mayor of the capital.

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:22.750
So I'm gonna be available.

00:08:22.750 --> 00:08:26.850
Elect title that's extracted from this start.

00:08:26.850 --> 00:08:31.250
State will come here and say if they start calmed,

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.910
moderates five equals toe zero.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:38.240
That means we have already changed the state five times.

00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.170
If title,

00:08:40.170 --> 00:08:41.700
which is the local variable,

00:08:41.700 --> 00:08:44.060
is equals to the word,

00:08:44.060 --> 00:08:50.940
then reveal changes to something else and yes,

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.100
we'll keep it back.

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:55.480
As title equals toe this value,

00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:56.660
it steps on a copy.

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:57.360
This based,

00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:59.600
it removed these two equals.

00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:00.970
Now we have this title.

00:09:00.970 --> 00:09:01.310
Of course,

00:09:01.310 --> 00:09:04.570
you're going to say react is awesome.

00:09:04.570 --> 00:09:11.040
And one last thing is that instead of using the title with this hollow word,

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:16.620
I just want to update the title with the title and know that we're using the Year 16 style

00:09:16.620 --> 00:09:18.810
of creating an object using a variable.

00:09:18.810 --> 00:09:20.970
It is Samos typing title,

00:09:20.970 --> 00:09:22.020
colon title.

00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:23.680
But this is gonna do.

00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:29.550
I'm gonna say this now go back to the browser and let's see if we can wait for the first.

00:09:29.550 --> 00:09:33.040
Now we can see it is implementing on as soon as it hits five.

00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.600
You see that the reactor is awesome,

00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.450
is updated,

00:09:35.450 --> 00:09:37.530
but the state is being changed,

00:09:37.530 --> 00:09:40.910
but only when it really changes to something else.

00:09:40.910 --> 00:09:45.430
Then the if is found and that is updating to the rial down.

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.110
So all the updates that you see here is going on currently the Watcher down.

00:09:50.110 --> 00:09:52.230
But when it has changed to something else,

00:09:52.230 --> 00:09:54.520
which is other than what is there in the real job,

00:09:54.520 --> 00:09:58.010
then only the real Don is going to be updated.

00:09:58.010 --> 00:09:59.250
Let's go back.

00:09:59.250 --> 00:10:06.200
We can also create another component on display the same thing after this and you will see

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.670
that changes in the state off the parent component is affecting only this particular hitch

00:10:11.670 --> 00:10:13.490
one and not the child component.

00:10:13.490 --> 00:10:16.600
So that child component will not be painted.

00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:17.650
For example,

00:10:17.650 --> 00:10:21.230
they fear that component called subheading,

00:10:21.230 --> 00:10:29.660
which is a function that takes crops and going to return a simple paragraph which is

00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.190
forward by Yeah,

00:10:32.190 --> 00:10:34.550
it's for the cynical in here.

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.850
Let's use this right here.

00:10:36.850 --> 00:10:42.230
I'm gonna rape your subheading slash and save this.

00:10:42.230 --> 00:10:48.000
Go back to the browser and you will see that even when the actual fatal hello ER changes to

00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.130
react is awesome.

00:10:49.130 --> 00:10:55.140
You'll see that the battle of is not being repainted so which means that the react is only

00:10:55.140 --> 00:11:00.100
going to touch the yield on if there is really need and not other ways
