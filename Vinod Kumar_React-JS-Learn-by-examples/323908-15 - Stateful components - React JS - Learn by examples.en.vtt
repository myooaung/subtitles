00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
Now let's discuss about state off a component on what's called state full component.

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:07.590
For this demonstration,

00:00:07.590 --> 00:00:14.340
I created a simple react jest application that has a heading called Religious Counter

00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:15.050
Application.

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:17.880
And if you come and have a look at this in SRC,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.450
there is absolutely nothing other than indexed RTs index George Aces.

00:00:22.450 --> 00:00:27.970
Rendering a component called on the AB is a simple deal with a class name.

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:30.550
Off container is the food shop class name,

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.750
and then we have a H one,

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.630
which is a CSS class from Bootstrap once again,

00:00:35.630 --> 00:00:37.130
alert alert in four,

00:00:37.130 --> 00:00:41.150
which is what actually making this look like a bluish background.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:47.250
The incident I have available called now whose value is initially zero,

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:53.170
and I want to implement this by using a button so I can have a button over here by taping

00:00:53.170 --> 00:00:54.110
Important,

00:00:54.110 --> 00:00:57.960
probably against a Class them off median,

00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:58.500
VT.

00:00:58.500 --> 00:00:59.590
And dash primary.

00:00:59.590 --> 00:01:01.810
That's the CSS plus from Bootstrap.

00:01:01.810 --> 00:01:04.800
And then I could take your something like increments.

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.060
Save this.

00:01:07.060 --> 00:01:08.640
Go back to the browser.

00:01:08.640 --> 00:01:10.720
I'm here instrument as a button.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:11.200
Of course,

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:14.670
the value off numb is not used that I'm getting a warning.

00:01:14.670 --> 00:01:20.280
Let's come down here in the entire history as a value off numb.

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:21.980
He's in college mackerel,

00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.760
say Now,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.880
save this number comes a zero,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.240
but inclement.

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:31.980
But it doesn't work because we're not assigned anything to that now.

00:01:31.980 --> 00:01:34.220
That's a function here called Implement,

00:01:34.220 --> 00:01:36.400
using the Arrow Function state,

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:40.170
which is supposed to incriminate the value off this numb.

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:41.540
But unfortunately,

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.150
none is a local variable and cannot be accessed over here.

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:46.900
Now.

00:01:46.900 --> 00:01:50.360
This is where we have to make this numb as a global variable,

00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:58.460
and the very edges suggest is that you create something called ST On stage is an object

00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:00.400
with in number of properties.

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.940
I can have one of the property is month,

00:02:02.940 --> 00:02:04.610
whose initial value is zero.

00:02:04.610 --> 00:02:06.650
You can remove this from here,

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:09.070
and since we have a state as a member,

00:02:09.070 --> 00:02:09.680
variable,

00:02:09.680 --> 00:02:11.470
which has a property called,

00:02:11.470 --> 00:02:11.840
um,

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:17.450
I can print here this dark stage don't know and it brings zero.

00:02:17.450 --> 00:02:18.800
So if I come back to browser,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.280
you can see it,

00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.940
says Valley of number zero in Get if I give you hear someone 20 save it,

00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:26.570
come back and you should see that it is really off.

00:02:26.570 --> 00:02:29.910
Nominees 1 20 So which means it's coming from the state.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:35.020
Let's put that back to zero Now I want to assign this function to the button on the way you

00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:41.350
do It is on if courts toe in current like that distort instrument.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:42.570
Of course,

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:45.180
the instrument function doesn't do anything yet.

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:46.750
I have to implement this.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:54.460
If I type your this start escaped out now which is currently zero simply plus Plus you

00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:55.750
might think it should work.

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.740
But if I come down here and then click on this,

00:02:58.740 --> 00:03:01.150
you can see that it is not working.

00:03:01.150 --> 00:03:01.580
Plus,

00:03:01.580 --> 00:03:03.230
there is also a warning message.

00:03:03.230 --> 00:03:09.280
Do not mutate State directly Use the SEC state function now.

00:03:09.280 --> 00:03:15.800
This is because of her attended religious follows where we do not want toe mutate Our

00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:18.050
change the value of the state directly.

00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:19.350
It has to be done.

00:03:19.350 --> 00:03:21.600
Why are a function call set state?

00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:27.530
Because this function triggers some lifecycle activities Also where they react a load This

00:03:27.530 --> 00:03:31.910
kind of mechanism and changes in the state will not be reflected in the U.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:31.970
S.

00:03:31.970 --> 00:03:33.930
Because off lifecycle mechanisms.

00:03:33.930 --> 00:03:39.510
I cannot say this store said stage which takes an object of the perimeter and that dick

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:42.400
represents the do state off the component.

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.190
Now I can say that the new state,

00:03:45.190 --> 00:03:47.150
if they have a property called dumb,

00:03:47.150 --> 00:03:51.150
which is the current value off the start stayed are now,

00:03:51.150 --> 00:03:51.770
Yes,

00:03:51.770 --> 00:03:52.160
one.

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:55.450
I can say this and go back to the browser.

00:03:55.450 --> 00:03:56.830
And then if I click on this,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:04:00.760
you'll see that the state is now being reflected over here.

00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:01.400
Now,

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:02.530
if you observe,

00:04:02.530 --> 00:04:07.540
the value off number is is actually printed from the render function,

00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:13.450
which means that every time the sex status card that ended function is once again in Nord.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.020
Just to prove this point,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:16.890
that's just type your counsel law.

00:04:16.890 --> 00:04:26.610
I can say Render is in looked off on your new age that's gonna print the date and time off

00:04:26.610 --> 00:04:30.610
the interrogations so first time you can see it has been printed over here.

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:31.250
It says,

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:32.150
Render is in north,

00:04:32.150 --> 00:04:32.720
down so on,

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:33.670
so date and time.

00:04:33.670 --> 00:04:35.450
But if I click on this increment,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.660
you can see the render is again card,

00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:40.570
and every time I click on this instrument button,

00:04:40.570 --> 00:04:42.450
that ended function will also be called.

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:47.830
So this is the reason why we have to use Sex State instead of mutilating the state directly

00:04:47.830 --> 00:04:50.390
on mutating the state directly does not work.

00:04:50.390 --> 00:04:50.950
Also,

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:56.130
this is one more thing that you have to keep in mind that seems calling the set state

00:04:56.130 --> 00:04:59.710
because the render you should never call the six State inside.

00:04:59.710 --> 00:05:01.890
They render itself because then it gets in tow.

00:05:01.890 --> 00:05:03.330
What's called precaution?

00:05:03.330 --> 00:05:08.500
You can give it a try by simply calling this one small over here on.

00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:09.400
Save this.

00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.980
You can see that it's going in a loop and it's never stopping.

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:19.710
And after some time it comes back with an editor saying that maximum update that exceeded

00:05:19.710 --> 00:05:25.300
this can happen when a component repeatedly called set stayed inside component will update

00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.050
our component deducted.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:27.970
But of course,

00:05:27.970 --> 00:05:31.560
what we're doing is we're doing it in one of the life second function called Brenda.

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:35.350
So you should never call the sensed it inside the Rendall function.

00:05:35.350 --> 00:05:36.750
Save this.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.260
Now the increment works.

00:05:38.260 --> 00:05:45.020
We can also bring in a criminal function and the detriment function.

00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:48.450
I can have it as dick treatment he calls toe,

00:05:48.450 --> 00:05:55.140
and then I can supply this start said State off And then I figure number.

00:05:55.140 --> 00:05:59.500
They start state don't know minus one,

00:05:59.500 --> 00:06:04.590
and then I cannot send them to a button so I can make a copy off this on,

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:05.920
then base it over here.

00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:07.700
I call this as detriment.

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.180
And then,

00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:09.580
of course,

00:06:09.580 --> 00:06:12.550
the labour also should be changed to Dick Clement.

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:17.140
I have students for implementing and documenting.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.790
So this is incriminating.

00:06:18.790 --> 00:06:19.950
And this is Dick lamenting.

00:06:19.950 --> 00:06:27.130
You can also combine them into a single function probably say increments our agreement,

00:06:27.130 --> 00:06:28.680
which can take a perimeter.

00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.630
So to do that,

00:06:29.630 --> 00:06:36.660
let me commend this out and then clear a function here called increment for detriment,

00:06:36.660 --> 00:06:40.050
which is supposed to be a function that takes a pyramid at this time.

00:06:40.050 --> 00:06:40.750
So let's,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.360
for example,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:45.410
I colored as Big Van our allude Onda.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:52.260
That function exists increment value and will either average are subtracted safe I n c.

00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:52.740
Valleys.

00:06:52.740 --> 00:06:53.910
One day initially,

00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:56.040
increment of Diane's evil is minus.

00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.160
Wanted to predicament.

00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:03.340
I can simply copy the statement based over here instead of minus one here at that.

00:07:03.340 --> 00:07:04.090
Plus,

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:11.050
I see Val and now I have to pass either minus one are plus one from these two buttons.

00:07:11.050 --> 00:07:12.110
Now the question is,

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:12.840
how do we do this?

00:07:12.840 --> 00:07:13.330
Because here,

00:07:13.330 --> 00:07:14.020
if you see,

00:07:14.020 --> 00:07:18.000
we are only given the name of the function we are not calling that function.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.810
So in this case,

00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:21.230
when I click on the button,

00:07:21.230 --> 00:07:23.080
it's the browser with supplies.

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:30.080
The dumb event and the donkey even 100 by react will now call this function automatically.

00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:34.900
So obviously this time we are supposed to pass in a value which means we are supposed to

00:07:34.900 --> 00:07:35.820
call the function.

00:07:35.820 --> 00:07:36.760
How do we do this now?

00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:43.300
So this is done by writing an anonymous function over here and calling them by ourselves.

00:07:43.300 --> 00:07:45.550
So I just bring this under the next line.

00:07:45.550 --> 00:07:46.410
So now here.

00:07:46.410 --> 00:07:50.980
I'm gonna say that this start increment is not the function to be called,

00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.770
but instead,

00:07:51.770 --> 00:07:54.190
this is the function to be involved.

00:07:54.190 --> 00:07:58.600
So which will be supplying anonymous function and that function should be invoked.

00:07:58.600 --> 00:07:59.280
Onda.

00:07:59.280 --> 00:07:59.520
Now,

00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:00.310
inside this,

00:08:00.310 --> 00:08:06.240
I can call increments on the crim it so I can say you're a Gaullist increments argument

00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:07.040
with oneness,

00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:09.350
the value and then the same thing.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.250
I'm gonna pass it on over here,

00:08:11.250 --> 00:08:17.070
Onda minus one being the value.

00:08:17.070 --> 00:08:18.110
Of course,

00:08:18.110 --> 00:08:21.490
Whenever you're trying to refer toa member functions of a class,

00:08:21.490 --> 00:08:23.830
this start is mandatory.

00:08:23.830 --> 00:08:25.540
Simon also savior,

00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:26.950
they start Siri it.

00:08:26.950 --> 00:08:31.010
Now if you go back to the browser on click on increments,

00:08:31.010 --> 00:08:35.550
you can see this incriminating big element also is working properly
