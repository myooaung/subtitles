00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
suppose we want to provide a link here for the name so that when you click on this,

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:08.050
we want to see the details off this person.

00:00:08.050 --> 00:00:08.940
Oh,

00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:14.380
I suppose if you add a new contract by clicking this button after filling the details are

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:16.440
if you click on the audio contact,

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:17.910
fill in the details,

00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:21.650
click on the active list instead of staying back in the same page.

00:00:21.650 --> 00:00:25.870
I want to go back to view all contact so I can go and very fair weather.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:29.470
It has been added successfully or not to demonstrate the same.

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:30.090
First,

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:33.140
let me clear a new component that can be displayed here,

00:00:33.140 --> 00:00:36.090
which is going to show the details of a selected contact.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.200
So let's go back to visual studio core.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:48.810
I'm gonna go on clear the new fight here and that a saucy car contact details start gs on.

00:00:48.810 --> 00:00:52.470
This is gonna be a a class based component.

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.030
So I say here I am,

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:54.660
RC.

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:01.400
And then I'd say CCS that's gonna give me a class based component.

00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:03.940
I don't want the state this time,

00:01:03.940 --> 00:01:05.540
so I'm gonna get it off this.

00:01:05.540 --> 00:01:08.020
I haven't written a component over here,

00:01:08.020 --> 00:01:10.410
which is just a roll with two columns.

00:01:10.410 --> 00:01:13.250
The first column made sure that we meet in the second column,

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:15.940
may show the details of the particular person.

00:01:15.940 --> 00:01:20.370
So before we start taping the Render Functions J six,

00:01:20.370 --> 00:01:23.450
let's can work this job a script toe react,

00:01:23.450 --> 00:01:33.480
JavaScript and then I take your dot ro conveying dot call Dash MD Dash four plus dark call

00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:35.470
Dash MD dash.

00:01:35.470 --> 00:01:37.830
Probably seven or gate.

00:01:37.830 --> 00:01:40.200
It should be less than or equal to 12.

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.720
Press enter.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:44.750
I got one row with two columns in it.

00:01:44.750 --> 00:01:46.910
The first column is supposed to despair.

00:01:46.910 --> 00:01:52.390
Image on the 2nd 1 is supposed to display the rest of the beat it and I want this component

00:01:52.390 --> 00:01:59.480
to be placed only when an idea is being supplied after clicking on a particular user.

00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.240
So if I click on this user,

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:03.980
the idea of this particular person should be supplied.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:04.760
Similarly,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.550
when I click on this person here,

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:12.990
Diary of this person should be supplied and received over here so that we can quietly for

00:02:12.990 --> 00:02:17.950
that particular data and then display the same to understand how this is gonna work.

00:02:17.950 --> 00:02:18.480
Let's go on.

00:02:18.480 --> 00:02:21.290
Add some basic condemned over here.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:26.690
First time at a deal that consists off the end of the road here on,

00:02:26.690 --> 00:02:27.210
in fact,

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:33.360
that they were gonna add a hit three which there's something like details off the selected

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:34.540
contact.

00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.070
And I want to display what is the I D name.

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:37.860
It's a trade secret,

00:02:37.860 --> 00:02:46.760
but first I'm no just to a console law off this start from's and let me go to the index or

00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:51.790
Js indexed RJ's is going toe display all these things,

00:02:51.790 --> 00:02:55.240
But when a specific idea has been supplied,

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.130
I want to display a specific contact person.

00:02:58.130 --> 00:02:59.900
So I'm gonna type your route.

00:02:59.900 --> 00:03:02.610
Want equals toe slash,

00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:08.500
contact dash details slash This part should be a variable,

00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:10.260
not like a contact details,

00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.200
which is a hard coded text.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.990
I'm gonna take your colon,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:18.240
which is very important now because this identifies that this part of the part is a

00:03:18.240 --> 00:03:18.880
variable.

00:03:18.880 --> 00:03:20.660
I can give any name I want.

00:03:20.660 --> 00:03:25.090
I give it as idea because it makes sense as that it's a 90 on.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.140
Then I'll light your exact so I don't want any partial matches and also say component

00:03:31.140 --> 00:03:32.860
equals toe contact.

00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:38.500
Details on contacted It's will be imported and will be used over here So we have imported

00:03:38.500 --> 00:03:39.230
that from here.

00:03:39.230 --> 00:03:42.200
So if I go back to the browser here now,

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:43.090
I'm not perverted.

00:03:43.090 --> 00:03:46.780
Any hyperlink And this text is part of the contact card,

00:03:46.780 --> 00:03:48.230
not the contact list.

00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:51.380
Contact list is made up off one or more contact cards.

00:03:51.380 --> 00:03:54.640
I have to go to the contract car and had a link over here.

00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:55.810
So to do that,

00:03:55.810 --> 00:03:58.730
let's go to the contact car and then first,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.050
are they import?

00:04:00.050 --> 00:04:01.140
So this time,

00:04:01.140 --> 00:04:07.100
what we want to import from the react router is the link Onda,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:11.660
we come down to the name which is to spare over here on.

00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.250
I'm gonna surround that with a link.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.480
And then I said do equals two.

00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:22.570
I have toe supply your contact that details slash,

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:24.430
followed by the idea of the person.

00:04:24.430 --> 00:04:25.310
Now,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:32.250
if you think that you can give something like this where I can add a live like a contact or

00:04:32.250 --> 00:04:32.740
Heidi,

00:04:32.740 --> 00:04:38.860
this is not gonna work because this is not something that we can use inside a string.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:41.740
So if you'll save this and go back to the browser,

00:04:41.740 --> 00:04:44.540
I see a hyperlink airport connect Click on this guy pulling.

00:04:44.540 --> 00:04:50.580
You will see that is actually placing that curly bracket contact that I'd be calibrated so

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:52.010
we don't want that one.

00:04:52.010 --> 00:04:53.070
So instead,

00:04:53.070 --> 00:04:56.890
what we have to do is we had to convert this into an expression.

00:04:56.890 --> 00:04:58.450
So I'm gonna are here.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:04.590
This expression on this has to be inside that inside the expression I can give you an

00:05:04.590 --> 00:05:04.870
answer.

00:05:04.870 --> 00:05:06.350
Plus So basically,

00:05:06.350 --> 00:05:08.610
we are having an expression here,

00:05:08.610 --> 00:05:13.020
which is a combination off a string on an integer over here.

00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:14.450
So let's save this.

00:05:14.450 --> 00:05:16.500
Go back to the browser on then.

00:05:16.500 --> 00:05:19.530
If I go to view all contacts kick on this,

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:22.720
you'll see that it is contacts Last details six.

00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:25.670
And then I have this particular text over here.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:27.890
Now that I have this number six,

00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:33.210
I have Duke Whitey for this particular persons details and then display the same thing.

00:05:33.210 --> 00:05:35.850
Since we're using real eggs over here,

00:05:35.850 --> 00:05:39.060
obviously we get the idea over here on.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:40.540
Then we want toe access,

00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:41.100
that idea.

00:05:41.100 --> 00:05:46.350
But how do we access the idea overhears I won't be printed that distort problem.

00:05:46.350 --> 00:05:53.130
So if I go back to the browser and then save view developer javascript console and it's

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:54.040
either in the council,

00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:58.390
we have an object which is actually the trumps being displayed over here,

00:05:58.390 --> 00:06:00.930
the props has history,

00:06:00.930 --> 00:06:04.790
location and match coming as few props.

00:06:04.790 --> 00:06:07.160
So if I go back to the indexed RGs,

00:06:07.160 --> 00:06:11.920
if you see here that we're actually having a voter as a parent,

00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:15.610
this is injecting those props like history,

00:06:15.610 --> 00:06:17.150
location and match.

00:06:17.150 --> 00:06:20.540
So which is propagated toe All these components,

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:23.850
like link our to our components over here.

00:06:23.850 --> 00:06:26.190
One of that happens to be contacted it So,

00:06:26.190 --> 00:06:30.060
which means every component here have received the props,

00:06:30.060 --> 00:06:31.210
Korda's history,

00:06:31.210 --> 00:06:32.940
location and match.

00:06:32.940 --> 00:06:36.380
So if I expand this once again in the match,

00:06:36.380 --> 00:06:38.660
you'll see that it has something called problems.

00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:40.930
So match dark parents dark.

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:47.050
I d will give you that six in the string format so I can go back to the core and here I can

00:06:47.050 --> 00:06:48.680
access distort props.

00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:51.780
Don't match dot caroms dot i d.

00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.530
So I can see here Let I li equals toe distort crops.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:02.550
Start matched our problems and then I can print it out.

00:07:02.550 --> 00:07:03.190
Probably.

00:07:03.190 --> 00:07:09.360
I can see your details of the selected contact with idea and then I take your I d save this

00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:11.250
and go back and you'll see No,

00:07:11.250 --> 00:07:13.790
it says that with idee off six.

00:07:13.790 --> 00:07:19.250
So if I go back to another contact and then say show me the details of this person,

00:07:19.250 --> 00:07:20.110
it says here,

00:07:20.110 --> 00:07:20.560
eat.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:22.810
The next step here is Toe Richard.

00:07:22.810 --> 00:07:28.680
The data corresponding to this particular I D which is not the job off the component and on

00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:33.080
these jobs are being now shifted toe our readers actions.

00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.850
So that's gon do step by step on the changes needed.

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:41.730
So the first thing that we want to define here is probably a type I'm gonna copy.

00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:43.030
Paste this on,

00:07:43.030 --> 00:07:44.050
change this to,

00:07:44.050 --> 00:07:52.150
for example So get contact because we're getting a single contact and then goto actions,

00:07:52.150 --> 00:07:53.170
the context,

00:07:53.170 --> 00:07:53.550
action,

00:07:53.550 --> 00:07:56.850
torches and another function over here,

00:07:56.850 --> 00:08:04.570
which is a carrier function which is get contact probably I can save by Ivy equals toe

00:08:04.570 --> 00:08:08.340
something that with things and ideas of a part as the idea that has been selected.

00:08:08.340 --> 00:08:12.290
And then we now have a middle coming into picture,

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:17.940
which gives me a dispatch function from the store and then using that,

00:08:17.940 --> 00:08:20.690
I want to get the data from the rest endpoint.

00:08:20.690 --> 00:08:25.920
So this is where they left breast equals two of eight fetch.

00:08:25.920 --> 00:08:32.130
You are plus ivy method by default is gonna get once we get the response and will say let

00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:34.850
contact equals to await.

00:08:34.850 --> 00:08:36.450
Arrested are Jason.

00:08:36.450 --> 00:08:38.590
And now we have the contact object.

00:08:38.590 --> 00:08:42.130
All I have to do is to dispatch the actions I'm gonna save.

00:08:42.130 --> 00:08:46.690
Dispatch the type off the action this time is gonna be something going.

00:08:46.690 --> 00:08:48.230
Get on the score contact.

00:08:48.230 --> 00:08:53.100
And the data corresponding to that happens to be the contract that we just know received

00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:54.370
from the rest endpoint.

00:08:54.370 --> 00:08:55.430
There is a spell.

00:08:55.430 --> 00:08:57.030
Mystic over here.

00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.300
So this is the dispatch.

00:08:59.300 --> 00:09:00.520
Once we got this,

00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:06.350
we now have to update our producer because every dispatched action is processed using a

00:09:06.350 --> 00:09:06.940
reducer.

00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.670
I'm gonna go into my reducer over here.

00:09:09.670 --> 00:09:10.160
Context,

00:09:10.160 --> 00:09:10.750
producer.

00:09:10.750 --> 00:09:18.290
At another switch case here saying case get underscore contact.

00:09:18.290 --> 00:09:20.570
And then I say here returned.

00:09:20.570 --> 00:09:23.040
Whatever is there in the state,

00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.320
which contains I really a list off contacts along with that,

00:09:27.320 --> 00:09:30.550
we want to supply this one single contact.

00:09:30.550 --> 00:09:32.770
Not that it is not plural,

00:09:32.770 --> 00:09:34.790
because it's not a list.

00:09:34.790 --> 00:09:39.980
Our dispatched action contains a data which is a single contact.

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:43.070
So we come down here and then say action,

00:09:43.070 --> 00:09:43.950
dark data.

00:09:43.950 --> 00:09:49.830
So now This is the one that we want in our contact details speech.

00:09:49.830 --> 00:09:51.150
So I saved this.

00:09:51.150 --> 00:09:55.450
Go back to the contact Details stage here we have toe connected.

00:09:55.450 --> 00:09:55.990
Two things.

00:09:55.990 --> 00:09:56.400
Number one,

00:09:56.400 --> 00:10:00.030
We have to connect the data coming from the store number two.

00:10:00.030 --> 00:10:03.310
We also have to connect the action that we have returned.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:07.940
So I'm gonna import first from react leaders.

00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:11.750
What score as they connected to the function.

00:10:11.750 --> 00:10:14.320
Second,

00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:21.470
I want to import my own action function that we wrote under actions called contact actions

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:21.470
.

00:10:21.470 --> 00:10:24.820
The method name is called Get contact by Ivy.

00:10:24.820 --> 00:10:26.370
So this is what we want to connect.

00:10:26.370 --> 00:10:27.410
Let me right here.

00:10:27.410 --> 00:10:30.970
Two variables Const Skate as cross,

00:10:30.970 --> 00:10:40.320
which is a function that receives on the rib users but has to return an object consisting

00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.870
off key value pairs.

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:43.110
The key is nothing.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:48.530
But what did the property that you want over here on the value off their property Is the

00:10:48.530 --> 00:10:51.010
state maintained in the store.

00:10:51.010 --> 00:10:53.360
So let me give it us contact,

00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:56.800
which is a property that's going to be received over here.

00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:01.330
But that represents the state coming from reducers.

00:11:01.330 --> 00:11:02.570
And that reduces,

00:11:02.570 --> 00:11:07.010
we have only wondered is is called contacts producer on the contacts or dessert.

00:11:07.010 --> 00:11:11.370
Now have a single contact object in the name off contact.

00:11:11.370 --> 00:11:13.070
So if you go back to contact Producer,

00:11:13.070 --> 00:11:13.670
is it?

00:11:13.670 --> 00:11:15.300
This is the one that we want.

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:16.290
Onda,

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:17.060
we come back.

00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:17.810
We're here.

00:11:17.810 --> 00:11:19.180
This is done.

00:11:19.180 --> 00:11:25.850
I want to read one more variable here for pounced actions as Forbes equals toe.

00:11:25.850 --> 00:11:27.430
This is a simple object.

00:11:27.430 --> 00:11:28.310
Where?

00:11:28.310 --> 00:11:31.190
What is the name of the property you want in this?

00:11:31.190 --> 00:11:32.700
Distort props here.

00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:34.690
So I would like to probably call us.

00:11:34.690 --> 00:11:37.380
Get conduct on that.

00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:38.910
Corresponds to what?

00:11:38.910 --> 00:11:40.210
The action function.

00:11:40.210 --> 00:11:43.760
This is a function I'm gonna copy and paste over here.

00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:46.730
If you want to keep the same name for both of them,

00:11:46.730 --> 00:11:49.650
then you can just removed like this and they should work as well.

00:11:49.650 --> 00:11:51.220
Now we have the status,

00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:53.200
props and actions as props.

00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:57.250
We now have to connect these two with other component.

00:11:57.250 --> 00:12:00.090
And that is done by using the connect function.

00:12:00.090 --> 00:12:00.560
Paul,

00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.830
which returns there.

00:12:01.830 --> 00:12:01.940
Hey,

00:12:01.940 --> 00:12:02.650
Josie.

00:12:02.650 --> 00:12:03.370
On then.

00:12:03.370 --> 00:12:04.710
I'm no past this.

00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:09.060
Contact details as an argument that the agency so the connect takes two arguments.

00:12:09.060 --> 00:12:11.780
One is called state as props and otherness.

00:12:11.780 --> 00:12:14.850
Car actions as props and save this.

00:12:14.850 --> 00:12:17.160
Now we have access to this so as off.

00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:17.490
No,

00:12:17.490 --> 00:12:19.150
we are not gonna do anything.

00:12:19.150 --> 00:12:24.300
But at least I should be able tow goto our component without any others.

00:12:24.300 --> 00:12:24.810
Now,

00:12:24.810 --> 00:12:28.360
when this component is loaded using this particular I d.

00:12:28.360 --> 00:12:30.540
We want to know Get that contact.

00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.140
So that's what I want to go over here.

00:12:32.140 --> 00:12:37.750
So I'm gonna come down and take your component did amount function.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:41.440
We're gonna call this function called Get contact by I d.

00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.660
Because we have access to this ideas.

00:12:43.660 --> 00:12:44.910
I don't need the door here.

00:12:44.910 --> 00:12:47.550
I'm gonna cut that from there and paste it over here.

00:12:47.550 --> 00:12:48.320
Obviously,

00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.100
I don't need this one here as well.

00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:56.000
So let's get off this and then now have the only had a function.

00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.830
I'm gonna say this start broad star,

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:59.440
get contact by I d.

00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:00.360
Off idea.

00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:03.790
Not that this function is an asynchronous function.

00:13:03.790 --> 00:13:06.000
Does not return any value to us.

00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:13.450
It simply fetches the data from the rest in point stores that in the state and the state is

00:13:13.450 --> 00:13:16.410
propagated toe this component as props.

00:13:16.410 --> 00:13:18.160
And that's this contact.

00:13:18.160 --> 00:13:23.890
So all I have to do is tow display the details off that contact using this over here.

00:13:23.890 --> 00:13:25.750
Since the contact is coming,

00:13:25.750 --> 00:13:26.560
US props,

00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:27.460
I'm no right.

00:13:27.460 --> 00:13:32.700
A local variable here called Let contact people's toe distort crops.

00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:34.410
So get that from the props.

00:13:34.410 --> 00:13:35.880
But what if it is not there?

00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:39.630
Because initially this drops does not contain the contact.

00:13:39.630 --> 00:13:41.920
It is only after the component is mounted.

00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:42.950
We get this,

00:13:42.950 --> 00:13:44.620
I can tell you,

00:13:44.620 --> 00:13:49.320
if not contact contact equals to an empty object.

00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:55.280
Now all we have to do is to display the image of that person over here and then the details

00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:55.800
over here.

00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:58.320
So let's start by creating an image.

00:13:58.320 --> 00:14:04.100
I'll take your i m g with a class off AMG AMG company.

00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:12.230
Now SRC is gonna come from the contacts and remove this and put a cuddly bracket and said

00:14:12.230 --> 00:14:18.390
contact dark picture aren't is gonna be corn attack dog name,

00:14:18.390 --> 00:14:21.500
class name anyway have given already.

00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:28.850
I can also add some additional styling like probably a height so I can just time equals toe

00:14:28.850 --> 00:14:32.440
height and then I would like something like 200 big cells.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:39.720
So let's check this out by saving this going back and see that we got the contact picture

00:14:39.720 --> 00:14:43.250
so that's tested out with another contact by taking on this,

00:14:43.250 --> 00:14:43.890
You see that?

00:14:43.890 --> 00:14:44.870
We've got the picture.

00:14:44.870 --> 00:14:47.550
Now it's the question of displaying the rest of the details.

00:14:47.550 --> 00:14:55.460
I want to use the table back with a class in court table as the last table border on.

00:14:55.460 --> 00:14:57.150
Then inside the people,

00:14:57.150 --> 00:15:02.600
I would provide a TR with probably three off them for name,

00:15:02.600 --> 00:15:04.030
email and phone number.

00:15:04.030 --> 00:15:09.250
And then all the Cheetos are gonna have to PD's gonna add to these.

00:15:09.250 --> 00:15:12.240
The 1st 2 TV is going to contain the labels I want.

00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.430
Same name on.

00:15:13.430 --> 00:15:16.050
This is nothing but contact our name.

00:15:16.050 --> 00:15:18.520
This is the demon.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:20.630
There was a contact.

00:15:20.630 --> 00:15:21.470
Your email.

00:15:21.470 --> 00:15:24.980
Next one is the phone number.

00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.160
And then this is gonna be contact art form.

00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.850
Save this.

00:15:30.850 --> 00:15:32.500
Go back to the browser.

00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:38.840
We got the details so I can click on any other details here and then see the similar or

00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:39.200
coach.

00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.160
You can see that it's navigating from one component of another component carrying some

00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:45.470
wrote perimeters.

00:15:45.470 --> 00:15:46.040
Also,

00:15:46.040 --> 00:15:50.350
one last thing we want to do is when we add a new contact here.

00:15:50.350 --> 00:15:56.340
After successfully adding I would like to go to the view all contact to see whether there

00:15:56.340 --> 00:15:59.170
has been added or not to do so.

00:15:59.170 --> 00:16:02.930
Let's go back to our contact form.

00:16:02.930 --> 00:16:06.200
This is where we're doing on the contact form.

00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:09.200
Has a function here called Submit Handler,

00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:13.530
where I'm actually calling this ad contact function,

00:16:13.530 --> 00:16:16.550
which is coming from the religious actions.

00:16:16.550 --> 00:16:17.260
After that,

00:16:17.260 --> 00:16:20.220
I'm setting their default values to the state.

00:16:20.220 --> 00:16:24.140
This time I don't need this because we grew navigate elsewhere.

00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:25.250
And it's very,

00:16:25.250 --> 00:16:26.350
very simple.

00:16:26.350 --> 00:16:34.600
You saw earlier that there waas distort props dot location dark history on dot match.

00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:40.550
We want to use the this dark crops start history to never get to a different locations.

00:16:40.550 --> 00:16:40.940
I must say,

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:48.710
here this dark props start history dot push And then we have the supply the road part that

00:16:48.710 --> 00:16:49.810
we want to never get to.

00:16:49.810 --> 00:16:50.740
So in this case,

00:16:50.740 --> 00:16:56.710
we say view all contacts and then save this and the job is done.

00:16:56.710 --> 00:16:58.520
Let's go back to a browser.

00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.170
Let's go to the end here.

00:17:00.170 --> 00:17:01.440
I have my details here.

00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:07.310
I'm gonna copy the picture location here and then delete this So it's gone on now I go back

00:17:07.310 --> 00:17:08.110
to the beginning.

00:17:08.110 --> 00:17:17.320
I click on add a new contract I'm gonna on myself as a new contract and the picture and I

00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.570
click on active list.

00:17:18.570 --> 00:17:21.320
Now we see it's navigated automatically.

00:17:21.320 --> 00:17:22.930
If I come down here,

00:17:22.930 --> 00:17:25.290
you'll see that the data has been added successfully.

00:17:25.290 --> 00:17:26.550
Of course,

00:17:26.550 --> 00:17:28.610
if the validation fades,

00:17:28.610 --> 00:17:29.870
it's going to stay back.

00:17:29.870 --> 00:17:34.320
It's only after the successful validation it's going to navigate elsewhere.

00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:38.790
So this is how you can convert any react application into a single page application.
