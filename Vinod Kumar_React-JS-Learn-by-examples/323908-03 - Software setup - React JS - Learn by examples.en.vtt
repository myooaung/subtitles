00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.400
for this course,

00:00:01.400 --> 00:00:03.800
we need only three softer setups.

00:00:03.800 --> 00:00:05.800
Number one is Norgay's.

00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:06.820
So,

00:00:06.820 --> 00:00:07.320
as you can see,

00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:14.250
there are two Donald buttons here and got $15 1 LTs LDS stand for long term support,

00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:19.050
and then we have $11.10 dollars zero current With the latest features,

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:22.790
I would like you to download the latest one and install.

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:25.390
Even if you have some older washing,

00:00:25.390 --> 00:00:32.170
please reinstall this new abortion so that your set up matters with the one on my computer

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:32.170
.

00:00:32.170 --> 00:00:33.690
Once you don't wrote this,

00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:35.640
just go ahead and install that.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:38.060
It's a straightforward with her in my kids.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:40.890
I already have been Start Soto verify.

00:00:40.890 --> 00:00:42.340
Once the installation is done,

00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:46.170
open a command front and then check for North Dash just washing,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:48.520
and it is washing $11.10 dollars.

00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:48.970
Zero.

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:51.800
Norges also comes with an NPM,

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.700
which is a North package manager.

00:00:53.700 --> 00:00:57.660
We can also verify the washing by typing NPM Dash Dash Russian.

00:00:57.660 --> 00:00:58.850
In my case,

00:00:58.850 --> 00:01:00.620
it's a 6.8 dot zero.

00:01:00.620 --> 00:01:02.900
Just in case if you have an older Russian,

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:09.500
you can upgrade by typing NPM off Date SG and beyond.

00:01:09.500 --> 00:01:10.760
On windows,

00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:13.730
this command will do as it is but on Mac,

00:01:13.730 --> 00:01:18.670
you may have to say pseudo for giving the administrative privileges.

00:01:18.670 --> 00:01:20.140
Since in my case,

00:01:20.140 --> 00:01:22.350
I already have the latest version off NPM.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:23.870
I'm gonna skip this step.

00:01:23.870 --> 00:01:26.510
No one snore.

00:01:26.510 --> 00:01:28.130
Jace is installed.

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:32.170
You can install what's called create react up.

00:01:32.170 --> 00:01:34.640
This is the North Package,

00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:40.650
which is developed by Facebook for creating a react application quickly to install this

00:01:40.650 --> 00:01:41.410
package,

00:01:41.410 --> 00:01:42.540
go back to the command,

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:47.390
prompt and taken the command NPM Dash g installed.

00:01:47.390 --> 00:01:52.460
And then they feared the act up once again for Mac users,

00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:58.110
you might have to add solo prefix for providing the administrator privileges I might get

00:01:58.110 --> 00:01:59.020
already have this.

00:01:59.020 --> 00:02:05.850
So I'm gonna get off this command and show the worsen by taking Create react After

00:02:05.850 --> 00:02:06.830
disasters.

00:02:06.830 --> 00:02:10.400
Fortunes on the current version is 2.1 dot five.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:14.750
As you can see that over here using this create react app package,

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:19.350
we will now be able to create new react applications without any problems.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:24.590
The bird in the final set of required with a extra later or an I d off your choice.

00:02:24.590 --> 00:02:29.910
My choice is Result Studio Court from Microsoft and I already have this.

00:02:29.910 --> 00:02:32.180
It's an e x e file on Windows.

00:02:32.180 --> 00:02:35.250
You just have to download this based on your operating system.

00:02:35.250 --> 00:02:36.780
There's a Mac windows and lean.

00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:36.940
It's,

00:02:36.940 --> 00:02:37.450
of course,

00:02:37.450 --> 00:02:39.100
based on your operating system.

00:02:39.100 --> 00:02:41.570
It has already decided that it's Mac on.

00:02:41.570 --> 00:02:42.660
Once you download,

00:02:42.660 --> 00:02:45.530
you can just start using in the future.

00:02:45.530 --> 00:02:47.290
When they introduced new features,

00:02:47.290 --> 00:02:52.160
they'll be automatically updated toe your existing visual studio chord because this falls

00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:52.550
in tow.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.410
One auto software,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.460
which are called evergreen Softwares.

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.310
In my case,

00:02:56.310 --> 00:02:57.330
I already have this,

00:02:57.330 --> 00:02:59.760
so I will keep the installation off this as well.
