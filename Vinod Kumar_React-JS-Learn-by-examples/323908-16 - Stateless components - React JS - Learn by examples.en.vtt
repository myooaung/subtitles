00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
let's make some changes to this application to understand the stateless component.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.400
If you see we have a single component called APP,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:15.450
which is being rendered onto the I won't do here and that contains a heading.

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.750
There is also a history which is displaying the value off the numb,

00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:21.250
and there are two persons here.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:28.790
Let's clear our own component representing a button by using a variable so I can say canst

00:00:28.790 --> 00:00:35.440
Oncologist TTN equals two drops Arab and the name your own wreckage,

00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.160
which represents the return value off this particular component.

00:00:39.160 --> 00:00:44.320
If you carefully observed drops is the parameter off dysfunction.

00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.520
This is the return belly of the function,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:51.880
and the return value is going to be a simple partner slash button like this,

00:00:51.880 --> 00:01:00.150
which consist off a caption called Instrument on Detriment and also should walk a function

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:03.730
called Implement are determined with the value off one.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:04.490
So,

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:05.290
in other words,

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:07.410
I would be expecting some props.

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.310
From here,

00:01:08.310 --> 00:01:11.880
it's assumed that drops consist of something called Capture.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:16.200
Someone take here from start caption.

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.180
Also,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:18.510
when you click on this button,

00:01:18.510 --> 00:01:24.880
it should invoke a function on Let's call this as on Click equals to that assume that crops

00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:27.420
comes with their function called handler.

00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:29.500
Say this now,

00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:31.850
How do I use this particular median?

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:32.460
And well,

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.110
simple.

00:01:33.110 --> 00:01:37.060
We may have to substitute this with our own component.

00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:38.600
So let's remove this and I'll die.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.520
Pierre Bt and with p Capital Beauty and and of course,

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.820
I can just give it like this.

00:01:43.820 --> 00:01:44.270
But then,

00:01:44.270 --> 00:01:44.670
of course,

00:01:44.670 --> 00:01:47.560
I'm not passed in a caption as well as handler.

00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:51.450
So I'm gonna supply the other caption equals toe.

00:01:51.450 --> 00:01:54.290
I can supply in court in agreement.

00:01:54.290 --> 00:01:56.000
That's what I want to call this is,

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:57.020
and then I can pass.

00:01:57.020 --> 00:01:58.880
Their handle equals toe.

00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:00.530
I need to supply a function.

00:02:00.530 --> 00:02:05.820
And this is where I'm gonna stuff like this start implement our agreement with one as the

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:12.690
value if you carefully observed here Caption on handler there soon as prompts.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:14.500
So prop start handler,

00:02:14.500 --> 00:02:16.930
which is this entire anonymous function,

00:02:16.930 --> 00:02:20.200
is now assigned to the on click off this particular button.

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:21.200
And of course,

00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.650
the value off interment is now added to this particular Rob start caption.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:32.310
So now I can remove this and then make a copy off the same year.

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:37.890
And then I call this as Dick Clement and make this as minus one.

00:02:37.890 --> 00:02:40.050
Save this.

00:02:40.050 --> 00:02:45.240
If I go back to the brother I see another be capital button is not defined.

00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.760
Its assuming that capital B is a component.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:50.890
I wanted this to be an extreme of back.

00:02:50.890 --> 00:02:54.570
So you use a small letter on the error should be gone.

00:02:54.570 --> 00:02:57.110
You can see that there are two Burton's.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:02:59.910
The button has increment and equipment over here.

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:04.400
CSS last name is not applied because I didn't supply from here.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.340
Not defined over here.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:11.100
I can always stayed class Name equals two and then by Bt in video.

00:03:11.100 --> 00:03:13.280
Dash Family saved this.

00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:18.840
Come back here and I should see the increment and Vikram importance that they do their work

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:18.840
.

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.680
If I click on this,

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:25.110
you can see it's working if I click on this and that's probably because I have given it

00:03:25.110 --> 00:03:25.910
wrong value here,

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:28.070
I should say minus one saved this.

00:03:28.070 --> 00:03:34.580
Go back to the browser on by increment as well as detriment and all of them are working

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:35.200
just fine.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:38.630
Since this particular component is not a class,

00:03:38.630 --> 00:03:41.750
it is a function that is no this keyword,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.970
which means that there is no state so state can only be part of a component if it is

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.790
defined as a class and not as a function.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:52.130
If you also want to further simplify,

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:57.900
you can get it up this props here and then use a curly bracket and say,

00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:05.280
Give me the caption on the handler so that I don't need this prop start to be used.

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.650
A dollar saved this.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.550
Go back to the browser,

00:04:08.550 --> 00:04:11.160
I should say in criminal works.

00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:12.940
Detriment also works.

00:04:12.940 --> 00:04:14.490
So point to remember,

00:04:14.490 --> 00:04:17.790
if you create a component using a function,

00:04:17.790 --> 00:04:20.100
it is always going to be stateless.

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.610
It will only received data from another component in the form off promise,

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:26.830
and it cannot define any state.

00:04:26.830 --> 00:04:28.230
And if you want state,

00:04:28.230 --> 00:04:34.050
it has to be defined as a class based component by inheriting a class car component.
