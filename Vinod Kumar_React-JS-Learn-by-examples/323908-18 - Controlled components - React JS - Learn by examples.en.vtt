00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.410
in HTML form elements like input text area,

00:00:04.410 --> 00:00:06.440
select check boxes.

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:13.100
Really Britain's difficult maintain their own state and update based on the user input in

00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:13.580
react.

00:00:13.580 --> 00:00:16.150
A component may dense its own state.

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:21.620
We can combine these two by making the react state as a single source of data.

00:00:21.620 --> 00:00:27.970
Then the area component that renders the form also controls what happens when the formed

00:00:27.970 --> 00:00:29.660
elements have been input.

00:00:29.660 --> 00:00:31.690
So such an input element,

00:00:31.690 --> 00:00:33.960
whose value is controlled by react,

00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:36.890
is now calling as a control component.

00:00:36.890 --> 00:00:38.260
To understand the same,

00:00:38.260 --> 00:00:41.290
I have already modified the previous demonstrations.

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.370
That's that I see a control component demo header.

00:00:44.370 --> 00:00:46.400
There is an HTML form.

00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.470
If I go to the source score,

00:00:48.470 --> 00:00:50.050
I have a indexed,

00:00:50.050 --> 00:00:50.950
or Js,

00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:52.810
which displays a hitch.

00:00:52.810 --> 00:00:55.660
One road do on two columns,

00:00:55.660 --> 00:00:56.730
and it was called him out.

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.700
The contact form.

00:00:57.700 --> 00:00:59.320
A contact form itself,

00:00:59.320 --> 00:01:00.370
is a component.

00:01:00.370 --> 00:01:02.460
This time it is a state full component.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.780
I have a state that represents name email,

00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:06.890
phone picture.

00:01:06.890 --> 00:01:14.480
The Rendall function defines an HTML form your with a label to display a caption for the

00:01:14.480 --> 00:01:15.250
next box.

00:01:15.250 --> 00:01:20.850
And then there is a deal consisting often input element compared to the previous example I

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:24.530
have removed the ref equals to name difficult to email,

00:01:24.530 --> 00:01:25.690
difficult stow phone,

00:01:25.690 --> 00:01:26.370
etcetera.

00:01:26.370 --> 00:01:29.400
And I just call it as name equals two.

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:32.850
Whenever you're making some changes Toe text box,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.460
there is a on change event fired.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:41.730
We can capture the changes made by the user on those input elements by assigning a event

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.100
handler to that on change event.

00:01:44.100 --> 00:01:47.170
Let's define a function called DF handler.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:50.070
And since this is going to be an even handle,

00:01:50.070 --> 00:01:54.030
we received the event off jackets politest evd on.

00:01:54.030 --> 00:01:58.980
This is gonna be an arrow function because we want toe bind this function always to the

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:00.540
component itself.

00:02:00.540 --> 00:02:09.930
And then I can take your on change equals Two in curly brackets will say this start if

00:02:09.930 --> 00:02:10.390
handled.

00:02:10.390 --> 00:02:10.890
Now,

00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:13.120
if you come back to the DF handle function,

00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:14.710
we can do some console long.

00:02:14.710 --> 00:02:18.350
Will they consider lock DVD dot Target,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:19.640
he went.

00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:24.730
Target represents the actual extra parts with all the properties of the exports.

00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:25.910
Let's say this.

00:02:25.910 --> 00:02:28.850
Go back to the browser rest after toe,

00:02:28.850 --> 00:02:30.310
open the developer console,

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:34.150
and if I come toe the name and then if I type a single letter,

00:02:34.150 --> 00:02:39.850
let's say a and you can see that we got the text box because that's the target off the

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:42.890
event on it says name on.

00:02:42.890 --> 00:02:45.390
But it's an input type off extra exeter.

00:02:45.390 --> 00:02:45.710
Now,

00:02:45.710 --> 00:02:51.020
if you come down to the email and you will not see the or put mainly because for the email

00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:58.880
text box behind associate ID that so if I copied this and paste same thing or email as the

00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.050
last two,

00:03:00.050 --> 00:03:05.050
the phone number on the picture save this and come back.

00:03:05.050 --> 00:03:07.600
And if I make any changes over here,

00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.460
you can see that we got the import name you call Still name.

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:14.870
That's because I taped over here I click here something and against If we get that email

00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:15.630
now,

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:19.230
the target object also has thes properties.

00:03:19.230 --> 00:03:29.550
Let's type your let name equals toe every t dot target dot name on let value equals toe gvt

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:29.940
dark,

00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:31.680
Get dart live.

00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:36.410
This is the name of the extras and this is the value entered by the user.

00:03:36.410 --> 00:03:38.580
So I'm gonna take that concern.

00:03:38.580 --> 00:03:40.300
Long name come up.

00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.560
Value saved this and go back.

00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:45.030
And each time I take something over here,

00:03:45.030 --> 00:03:49.110
you will see that the even base fired and I'm getting their data.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:51.350
Every time I do some changes,

00:03:51.350 --> 00:03:52.350
let's go back.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:59.450
We also want the value off the state to be updated toe extra boxes here so I can go toe

00:03:59.450 --> 00:04:07.620
each one off them and then say value equals two interlude market this dot state dot name on

00:04:07.620 --> 00:04:13.870
and the 2nd 1 I value equals toe the start state our email.

00:04:13.870 --> 00:04:16.440
3rd 1 being full.

00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:22.460
This is our state art form and the last one being the picture.

00:04:22.460 --> 00:04:28.020
Let's at here value equals to start scared out picture.

00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:31.170
This way,

00:04:31.170 --> 00:04:35.690
we are able to pass on the value off state members toe the phone.

00:04:35.690 --> 00:04:39.480
So if I come down now and if I tried to type something over here,

00:04:39.480 --> 00:04:41.820
you will see a strange behavior.

00:04:41.820 --> 00:04:48.030
I'm taking my name V i N body and you can see that I'm able to get one letter only,

00:04:48.030 --> 00:04:50.200
and it's not being typed over here.

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.950
This textbooks value is coming from the state.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:04:57.570
So every time I try to make some changes that even this fired,

00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:02.700
but the value of the picture box is reassigned from the state because that's what we're

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:06.950
doing over here on until the state changes.

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.550
You will never see the value off this text box to be changed to something else.

00:05:11.550 --> 00:05:18.810
So which means we want to know if this name represents the name extracts over here,

00:05:18.810 --> 00:05:20.620
then update this state.

00:05:20.620 --> 00:05:24.390
But if the demon value represent the email that they use a presenter,

00:05:24.390 --> 00:05:27.340
then we have to change this state to dynamically do this.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.450
We can always stay here something like this.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.390
It's declared a medieval card.

00:05:31.390 --> 00:05:35.580
Modified state quotes toe an empty object.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:40.930
Then I say your modified state off name it calls to value.

00:05:40.930 --> 00:05:43.230
So we now have a new object.

00:05:43.230 --> 00:05:43.990
For example,

00:05:43.990 --> 00:05:53.230
if I take this on the console and command distance or law,

00:05:53.230 --> 00:05:55.830
save this and go back to the browser.

00:05:55.830 --> 00:05:58.740
You will see that every time I take something here.

00:05:58.740 --> 00:06:00.240
So I'm getting the name by loopy.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:00.590
It's here.

00:06:00.590 --> 00:06:02.780
But as if I type here something else you can see.

00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:07.420
We got the object with email as the key and some values over here.

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:11.600
So now we can update this as the modified stated I can say,

00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.790
get stuffed,

00:06:12.790 --> 00:06:14.990
set state off,

00:06:14.990 --> 00:06:16.480
modified stage.

00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.130
Save this.

00:06:18.130 --> 00:06:20.290
And now if I go back to the browser,

00:06:20.290 --> 00:06:24.300
you should see that I'm able to type in on the textbooks.

00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:29.080
And I'm also seeing this instead of displaying this modified state,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.480
I can also display the current state,

00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:35.350
which is this start state saved this go back.

00:06:35.350 --> 00:06:36.840
And if I take No,

00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:37.400
we're not.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.090
You know,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:39.330
I have to be not article.

00:06:39.330 --> 00:06:45.570
You should see both name did not exist as a less email idea also has been updated over here

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:45.570
.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:48.820
Updating the state can be simplified for that.

00:06:48.820 --> 00:06:50.390
I can remove on this,

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:52.640
and I can say they start sex cage.

00:06:52.640 --> 00:07:01.520
And then I say with a new object whose key is DVD dot Our get started game and whose value

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:02.800
is DVD Dark.

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:08.000
Target our value just to verify if the state is updated properly.

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:15.050
Let's just all put the same before this victory in a paragraph using Jason dark,

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:16.690
stratified thing.

00:07:16.690 --> 00:07:17.930
Start state.

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:20.260
Save this.

00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:23.380
Go back to the browser you can see here.

00:07:23.380 --> 00:07:25.240
The current state is all in Christians.

00:07:25.240 --> 00:07:26.290
But if I type here,

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.750
you can see that it is updating the state.

00:07:28.750 --> 00:07:30.940
And I think here we know that you know,

00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:31.550
of course,

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.920
the name is retained.

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:35.150
Email is updated.

00:07:35.150 --> 00:07:36.570
If I take the phone numbers,

00:07:36.570 --> 00:07:40.880
you'll see that the phone number is also getting updated and,

00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.240
of course,

00:07:41.240 --> 00:07:42.050
the picture.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:46.560
You'll see that it's getting updated as well,

00:07:46.560 --> 00:07:50.770
and this works even if you're raising the value in the textbooks.

00:07:50.770 --> 00:07:51.150
Also,

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:54.070
as you can see,

00:07:54.070 --> 00:07:58.700
the component has a state which is directly associate ID with the form,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:03.170
and the component controls the state of the form using the state of the component,

00:08:03.170 --> 00:08:06.650
and hence these are called control components.
