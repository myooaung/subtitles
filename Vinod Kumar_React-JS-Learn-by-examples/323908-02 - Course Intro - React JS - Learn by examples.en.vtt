00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.390
my name is we know Andi.

00:00:02.390 --> 00:00:06.150
I welcome you to this course on learning the edges by examples.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:13.000
I went on to these three questions First number one while only a Jess Number two.

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.400
Why I learned it from me.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.170
And number three.

00:00:16.170 --> 00:00:19.870
What are we learning this course dance Of the first question.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:25.010
Why learned the actress D's The Edge is by far is the most popular jobless,

00:00:25.010 --> 00:00:25.750
different entry.

00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:30.350
But today it's not just famous because it's developed and made in by Facebook,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:33.850
but because it's very simple to call and faster.

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:37.690
If you have worked with angular by Google,

00:00:37.690 --> 00:00:42.700
you will soon learn that Reactors does not have too many features like angular.

00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:47.320
This allows the developers to make use off other JavaScript libraries,

00:00:47.320 --> 00:00:50.090
which are very strong and what they do on Bill.

00:00:50.090 --> 00:00:52.890
Even more awful high performing applications.

00:00:52.890 --> 00:00:54.200
No,

00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:56.700
don't to the second cushion while learning from me.

00:00:56.700 --> 00:00:57.920
Well,

00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.000
I've been a professional,

00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:04.740
full time softer trainer for over 23 years with the teaching experience in a wide variety

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:05.670
of technologies,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:09.210
have got thousands of software developers in many,

00:01:09.210 --> 00:01:13.020
many I T companies have also developed many freelance projects,

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:14.750
mostly on Web technologies.

00:01:14.750 --> 00:01:21.740
If you check the ratings and reviews off my other you Democrats is there already equals two

00:01:21.740 --> 00:01:26.350
R over 4.8 out of five and affable myself.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.850
Let's see what we have in store for you.

00:01:28.850 --> 00:01:29.890
Why this course?

00:01:29.890 --> 00:01:34.100
This course is doing it in a couple of sections on detection.

00:01:34.100 --> 00:01:37.540
Contains a bunch of video lessons each and every video.

00:01:37.540 --> 00:01:38.700
Listen users,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:39.990
according example,

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:41.350
to explain the topic,

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:45.050
and all of these examples are available for you to download.

00:01:45.050 --> 00:01:47.050
Refer are execute,

00:01:47.050 --> 00:01:50.950
although you may have fair or good idea JavaScript.

00:01:50.950 --> 00:01:53.780
Today's JavaScript offers new features,

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.250
which are generally used to react applications.

00:01:56.250 --> 00:01:59.140
So the first major sexual covers,

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:06.150
all in a three year 678 features so that you feel at home when learning the address itself

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:06.150
.

00:02:06.150 --> 00:02:08.120
After that,

00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:11.770
using 15 simple yet powerful examples,

00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:15.490
I'll explain all the major concepts of reactors with the life,

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.150
according I would encourage you to court along with me,

00:02:19.150 --> 00:02:21.240
pausing the video whenever needed.

00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:24.100
You Miles refer to the shared,

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:29.450
downloadable sit fights containing the application that I have quoted through these lessons

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:29.450
.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:30.640
Really,

00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:33.070
Jay's is kind of incomplete.

00:02:33.070 --> 00:02:35.890
Without integrating the so called leaders,

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:41.290
I'll come across many students in my classroom trainings who attempted to read about how to

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:44.750
use Redux with react and found it very difficult.

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:47.010
But after attending my classes,

00:02:47.010 --> 00:02:48.920
they feel very comfortable with three decks.

00:02:48.920 --> 00:02:51.720
Today in the third major section,

00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:55.020
I've explained the theory behind dealers using a plane.

00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.490
One in La Jolla skipped application without any react on,

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:00.700
then jump on people React application,

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.290
applying readers for something called state management.

00:03:04.290 --> 00:03:09.850
So let's get started by installing the necessary softer tools on your computer.
