00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.150
a friend and application is incomplete without the use off html forms.

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:11.050
There are two different ways off accessing data from an HTML form in area component.

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:15.450
The 1st 1 pregnancy is called uncontrolled component,

00:00:15.450 --> 00:00:19.280
and these are the components which have an acceptable form,

00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.330
and the data is accessed using what's called a ref.

00:00:23.330 --> 00:00:25.870
The other one is a control component.

00:00:25.870 --> 00:00:30.570
Will have the components of state owned directly with dates TML false.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:31.880
For this demonstration,

00:00:31.880 --> 00:00:34.580
I've already created area GIs application,

00:00:34.580 --> 00:00:41.480
which has got just an indexed or chase in its SRC folder and the indexed or two years to

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:43.150
find an app component.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:48.080
We trend us this HTML snippet do with a hitch one.

00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:56.970
Let's go toe a saucy fear that a new fine card contact form turkey s which is going to be a

00:00:56.970 --> 00:01:02.450
component based on a class from you say I am RC and then C C s.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:03.310
Right now,

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:05.150
we don't need to worry about state,

00:01:05.150 --> 00:01:06.090
so let's get it off.

00:01:06.090 --> 00:01:09.980
That And here is where only render an HTML form.

00:01:09.980 --> 00:01:12.890
Now that we are working with HTML in this section,

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.880
we can also use a cent exploited by Emmet abbreviations.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.180
If you're familiar with Emmett Deprivations.

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.640
And if you would like to use it,

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.440
you can check that it doesn't work over here.

00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:24.930
For example,

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:26.770
if I take you and trust enter,

00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.370
you can see it did not give me a deal slash deal.

00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:35.450
But if you come to the bottom right side off this i d There is something called Charles

00:01:35.450 --> 00:01:36.070
kept here.

00:01:36.070 --> 00:01:41.040
The syntax here is identified as a job loss cuts in tax even though it is not chalice

00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:46.950
script with this chalice kept XML So you click on that and then they javascript once again

00:01:46.950 --> 00:01:50.250
and you will see that there is something called Charles stood react.

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:52.890
And that is the one that we have to change to another.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:53.420
At the bottom.

00:01:53.420 --> 00:01:54.120
It is south.

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:54.520
Clear.

00:01:54.520 --> 00:01:56.750
And now for tape Your deal.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:01:57.750
Breast center.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.910
You can see we got a deal that also other form whose class name is form this ender.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:09.020
So we get a form Action equals two empty street.

00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:13.060
We don't need action because we're not communicating directly with sorrow.

00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:15.090
Side results here Justice?

00:02:15.090 --> 00:02:15.280
Yes,

00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.980
Just last name is enough and it take the form.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:24.870
I want to create one deal whose class name is the role as the last form group will take her

00:02:24.870 --> 00:02:32.830
deal Dart Form group Doctorow That's going to give me a do whose class name is formed group

00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:33.630
as a less room,

00:02:33.630 --> 00:02:36.480
and inside that I want I'll label.

00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:42.230
So this is the label whose CSS class name is control Neighbor.

00:02:42.230 --> 00:02:45.180
As the last we want to say,

00:02:45.180 --> 00:02:47.270
Call MD four,

00:02:47.270 --> 00:02:53.240
which means it's gonna occupy four grades out of 12 in a medium D ways endeth.

00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:00.490
You can see that it comes with label HTML for not that this is an alternate for the

00:03:00.490 --> 00:03:01.970
activity called for.

00:03:01.970 --> 00:03:04.740
Since four is a key word in journalistic,

00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:07.660
we cannot use the activity call for even to live in.

00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.170
It is rendered onto their Tom.

00:03:09.170 --> 00:03:13.710
This activity is replaced with why now,

00:03:13.710 --> 00:03:14.720
inside this label,

00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:20.820
I want Tokyo text me followed by in the deal,

00:03:20.820 --> 00:03:25.640
and this time and simplicity don't call MD age.

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:32.050
So the remaining eight out off trail that's into an insight that I'm gonna have an input

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:38.230
dark form control on that this is going to give you input text box.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:45.790
That's also give a history whose content is on a new contact after center and you'll see

00:03:45.790 --> 00:03:46.730
that you got a hit.

00:03:46.730 --> 00:03:47.270
Three.

00:03:47.270 --> 00:03:50.160
Add a new contact and save this for a minute.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.350
Go back to indexed or chase.

00:03:52.350 --> 00:03:57.840
First we'll do an import on that form from dot,

00:03:57.840 --> 00:04:05.340
slash conduct form and then we come here and then I contact for slash.

00:04:05.340 --> 00:04:06.910
Save this.

00:04:06.910 --> 00:04:08.520
And if you go back to the closer,

00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:10.510
we now see that Alan,

00:04:10.510 --> 00:04:11.750
your contact hits three.

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:14.880
There is a label called name and then they're the experts.

00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.190
And if you carefully observed,

00:04:16.190 --> 00:04:18.640
this is four grades off,

00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:22.310
12 on the text boxes occupying eight or after.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.000
If you want a smaller form that fits exactly half of this cream.

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:34.230
You can also add here a deal whose class name is Rome consisting off a deal whose trust in

00:04:34.230 --> 00:04:36.530
his skull But I want to off them.

00:04:36.530 --> 00:04:44.570
I can use this image syntax for generating Do with two more deals like this on then contact

00:04:44.570 --> 00:04:44.960
form.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:50.930
I can place it inside this like this so the second column is empty.

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:53.130
So if you save this and go back to the Broza,

00:04:53.130 --> 00:04:57.520
you'll see now the HTML form occupies only half of the street.

00:04:57.520 --> 00:04:58.170
Another record.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:05.240
The name let's are the other fields I'm going to copy this and based here for Let's say,

00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:05.830
email.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.680
So I'm going to say here,

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:09.050
email address,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:19.520
then one more 44 number and one more for picture.

00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:22.660
In most cases,

00:05:22.660 --> 00:05:24.740
ideas are going to be auto generated.

00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:26.390
We will not dance the user toe,

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:27.260
enter the I D.

00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:35.250
And after the 4th 1 I want to have your important So I can say important or PT the PDT and

00:05:35.250 --> 00:05:35.930
primary.

00:05:35.930 --> 00:05:42.760
This is going to give a blue collar button press enter and then and type year saved data.

00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.810
Save this.

00:05:43.810 --> 00:05:44.970
Go back to the browser.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:47.870
I see we have four different text boxes on.

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.610
We have a save data as a button.

00:05:49.610 --> 00:05:51.020
The next step is toe.

00:05:51.020 --> 00:05:54.360
Read the values entered in thes text boxes by the user.

00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.040
When you click on the same data and printed on the console,

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.920
I will rest after toe open the developer console.

00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.290
So when I click on the same data after typing something here,

00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:06.490
I should be able to see the later over here.

00:06:06.490 --> 00:06:08.880
So that's going out of function toe.

00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:11.250
This add new contact,

00:06:11.250 --> 00:06:14.180
which is equal stoop and adult function,

00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:20.000
and we would like this function to be executed when the former submitted the phone can be

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:25.890
submitted in do is not that the button inside a form by before it's considered as a subway

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:26.270
bottle.

00:06:26.270 --> 00:06:27.770
So if you click on this button,

00:06:27.770 --> 00:06:28.960
it is going to submit.

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:34.540
The second way to do is to press tender on any off this text boxes on the um,

00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:36.370
it'll submit automatically,

00:06:36.370 --> 00:06:40.940
and the formed triggers an event called us on Submit,

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:45.150
and we will assign this function to that particular event somewhere.

00:06:45.150 --> 00:06:52.450
Say yes on submit equals toe indican Liberec it this start a new contact.

00:06:52.450 --> 00:06:59.550
So there is one small issue whenever you press enter or when you click on the submit button

00:06:59.550 --> 00:06:59.880
on the,

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.260
um,

00:07:00.260 --> 00:07:04.180
it tries to send the details toe the action.

00:07:04.180 --> 00:07:05.310
Corresponding to this.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:07.720
I do not have an action right now,

00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.300
but you will see that the phone get refreshed when you press enter,

00:07:11.300 --> 00:07:14.510
and just to ensure that we reached dysfunction.

00:07:14.510 --> 00:07:20.650
Let's also add a so long saying that adding a new contract,

00:07:20.650 --> 00:07:24.870
Andi cities go back to the closer.

00:07:24.870 --> 00:07:29.730
I have been a name we don't here and then click on save data,

00:07:29.730 --> 00:07:33.230
and you will see that when I click on this same day.

00:07:33.230 --> 00:07:36.090
Drop The pages are refreshed.

00:07:36.090 --> 00:07:40.140
Toe around the default behavior off this form submission.

00:07:40.140 --> 00:07:44.180
We come down here and then ask for the event Object here.

00:07:44.180 --> 00:07:46.090
So this is the event objects.

00:07:46.090 --> 00:07:47.940
So since this even handler,

00:07:47.940 --> 00:07:50.940
we automatically get the event object.

00:07:50.940 --> 00:07:55.950
And then all I have to do is to say even two dot prevent default.

00:07:55.950 --> 00:08:01.730
And this ensures that the before behavior of the phone is cancelled.

00:08:01.730 --> 00:08:02.890
Saved this.

00:08:02.890 --> 00:08:04.430
Go back to the browser.

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:11.130
Maybe not taken same data and you will see that I reached the function.

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:14.380
But the former is not refreshed here.

00:08:14.380 --> 00:08:18.700
We want toe display the details ender in each of these text boxes.

00:08:18.700 --> 00:08:21.780
Since this is an uncontrolled component example,

00:08:21.780 --> 00:08:28.940
all we have to do is for each of these input box is we have to define what's card left.

00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:35.300
So I'm gonna take your ref recalls to given identified for the theme you can say difficult

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:36.220
to name here.

00:08:36.220 --> 00:08:37.310
Difficult stow,

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:48.410
even maybe phone for this and the last one being the picture know that we have left for

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:49.310
each one of them.

00:08:49.310 --> 00:08:52.180
I can come down here and then access.

00:08:52.180 --> 00:08:58.540
Then I had to declare for variables Understate constant name equals two This start.

00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.350
Refs don't name the value.

00:09:01.350 --> 00:09:07.530
This door drips is a collection off all the input elements off the form which have a ref

00:09:07.530 --> 00:09:09.240
attribute with some value there.

00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:10.150
Now,

00:09:10.150 --> 00:09:13.190
since we have a name as a ref,

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:16.760
we can actually access this either With their dark tradition,

00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:20.400
All we can access like this in the square back a tradition.

00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.840
I'm gonna use the dark tradition for this.

00:09:22.840 --> 00:09:28.950
I'm gonna copy this line based it three more times changes to even phone.

00:09:28.950 --> 00:09:37.190
And just now that I have before I can clear an object off that something like this I say

00:09:37.190 --> 00:09:43.570
const be one equal Stupni email Phone on picture.

00:09:43.570 --> 00:09:45.420
This is an year six,

00:09:45.420 --> 00:09:51.090
a style of creating an object with a variable card name whose value will be the value off

00:09:51.090 --> 00:09:51.830
the variable.

00:09:51.830 --> 00:09:56.170
So instructing name colon name we can simplicity need.

00:09:56.170 --> 00:09:58.640
So now we have this Be one.

00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:04.310
Let's love this on the console and see if we got the data entered in the textbooks.

00:10:04.310 --> 00:10:09.750
Say this and go back to the browser and they re not.

00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:15.840
You don't have You know that Call some phone number and then of course a picture.

00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:17.670
I can take your slash you know,

00:10:17.670 --> 00:10:18.470
dark chipping,

00:10:18.470 --> 00:10:23.140
save data and you'll see that it is adding a new contact.

00:10:23.140 --> 00:10:26.260
And this is the contact details that I have no idea,

00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.160
because we didn't auto gender this yet.

00:10:28.160 --> 00:10:31.860
We also like to clear the values in the extracts is.

00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:33.200
And that's easy.

00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:35.990
We have to Celia distorted ref.

00:10:35.990 --> 00:10:41.740
Start name The value equals toe an empty street and then out of copies,

00:10:41.740 --> 00:10:43.080
face three more times.

00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:46.000
Make changes to the refs name,

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.240
like email,

00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:52.840
full on and save.

00:10:52.840 --> 00:11:06.340
Please come back to the browser the same thing once again and taken save data.

00:11:06.340 --> 00:11:10.450
You can see that the data is are put on the council and the form is also cleared.

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:17.850
If I have 15 or 20 text boxes I have to do all these things for 50 are 20 off this.

00:11:17.850 --> 00:11:22.540
You can also notice that even though this is a class based component,

00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:27.890
we do not have state and the state is not associated with the form.

00:11:27.890 --> 00:11:31.330
And this is called uncontrolled component,

00:11:31.330 --> 00:11:36.640
meaning the component itself does not have any control or the state of the form.

00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:40.100

00:11:52.260 --> 00:11:54.150
