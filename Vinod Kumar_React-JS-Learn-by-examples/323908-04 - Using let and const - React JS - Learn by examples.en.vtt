00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.260
Let's start by creating a new folder on my desktop.

00:00:03.260 --> 00:00:08.870
Someone called it as react Js examples.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:15.490
And inside that I'm gonna have a new folder called Year Six Examples.

00:00:15.490 --> 00:00:25.040
I want Open Visual Studio called and then using this open for their button.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.980
Here are from the welcome screen.

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:28.750
There's an open folder option.

00:00:28.750 --> 00:00:32.250
I would like to select my store,

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:34.370
the edges Examples.

00:00:34.370 --> 00:00:37.520
Under your six examples,

00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:39.540
I'm gonna create a new file card.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.400
Eg zero Wonder gee s,

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:44.870
which is just going to be a job loss,

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:45.420
could fight.

00:00:45.420 --> 00:00:50.770
We will run this way and Norges because we want to understand the features off Maastricht.

00:00:50.770 --> 00:00:58.040
The 1st 1 that we want to learn about is the new key World called Let and then Const for

00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.700
this at this field variable called someone and assign a value off one.

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:08.790
And then there a function called test as a number one plus plus.

00:01:08.790 --> 00:01:12.010
And then when I come out off this function,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:15.650
I'm gonna scream the value of someone cemetery console law,

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:16.620
I said,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:18.330
someone gaze on that.

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:22.140
Send someone I'm not going to function yet,

00:01:22.140 --> 00:01:28.560
So the numbers that use one and then you can see it's going to just print this value as one

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:28.560
.

00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.570
But if you call this function for the test,

00:01:31.570 --> 00:01:34.300
the function test is tryingto instrument.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:39.200
The value of someone and the number one is not created inside this functions.

00:01:39.200 --> 00:01:43.050
It was been assigned outside because of it.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:44.810
It will simply income in the previous really,

00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:46.370
which is one that it becomes too.

00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:47.910
If a copy this line on,

00:01:47.910 --> 00:01:54.050
then paste it here you'll see that it prints the value of to let me go to the command front

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.050
.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:56.220
And then I've been Serie.

00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:03.150
That's stop and then reaction is examples followed by six examples.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:09.760
So I have this one final card eg zero wonder Jace to execute this using Nor you can take

00:02:09.760 --> 00:02:17.540
north exit A one are the exit a wonder Js and then first tender And it says someone use one

00:02:17.540 --> 00:02:22.900
number one is to But if I come down here and then declare a variable car what number one

00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:23.900
And then,

00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:24.490
of course,

00:02:24.490 --> 00:02:32.530
I would like to assign some value one Say this and run this once more You'll see this time

00:02:32.530 --> 00:02:33.990
you're gonna get a different airport.

00:02:33.990 --> 00:02:34.840
In both the cases,

00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:35.460
I'm getting numb.

00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:36.360
One is one,

00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.960
mainly because the function test amenities car.

00:02:39.960 --> 00:02:45.280
It implements the local copy and not the one which is declared old style of the function.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:50.180
So what makes the variable local to the particular function?

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:52.350
That's the primary goal of that.

00:02:52.350 --> 00:02:53.790
Let's take another example,

00:02:53.790 --> 00:02:59.950
some nuclear file called EG zero to Georgie S and I had a function Carla test.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.150
I knew there far superior so far.

00:03:05.150 --> 00:03:16.080
What I because to one less than a record store five I am plus plus And then I take your it

00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:17.490
inside the far room.

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:22.810
Why is and then I take you of the value of I off course.

00:03:22.810 --> 00:03:25.080
It's just gonna print that value of eyes.

00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:27.750
123452 Very For the same fourth,

00:03:27.750 --> 00:03:29.690
let's call the function for test.

00:03:29.690 --> 00:03:30.700
Save it.

00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:37.250
Go back to the command front and then I'll take your North EG zero to first enter American

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:39.570
C inside the follow IEA's.

00:03:39.570 --> 00:03:40.370
So on.

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:41.210
Now,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:42.700
if you go to the end of the four,

00:03:42.700 --> 00:03:43.840
Lubanga's tender,

00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:46.050
and then I type your console long.

00:03:46.050 --> 00:03:55.940
But they won't say off the fourth book I ease and then I just a pure I save this.

00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:59.010
Go back to the man can't read on this one.

00:03:59.010 --> 00:03:59.390
Small,

00:03:59.390 --> 00:04:00.520
you'll see,

00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.430
it says,

00:04:01.430 --> 00:04:04.300
Alter the fall of the value of I use six.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:09.090
So even though it was declared as if it is part of the farm loop,

00:04:09.090 --> 00:04:14.460
the variable became a local reliable off dysfunction and not the block level.

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:23.080
Variable 96 Dated is the key work on the ledge toe overcome this issue so that the valuable

00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.490
I loses its scope when you come out of this,

00:04:25.490 --> 00:04:26.720
so it's love war.

00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.920
If I take your left and save it and go back to the command,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:32.930
prompt real on this once more,

00:04:32.930 --> 00:04:38.790
you can see that it brings the value within the loop but penetrated printed all sort of the

00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:39.220
farm group.

00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:46.690
It says that the value of eyes undefined so you can't really trend that so let makes it to

00:04:46.690 --> 00:04:52.240
the block level variable so that the variable gets created when the block begins and the

00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:54.530
variable I is released from the memory.

00:04:54.530 --> 00:04:55.950
When the block is finished,

00:04:55.950 --> 00:05:01.050
another people waas introduced along with Let called us Const.

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:01.530
It's very,

00:05:01.530 --> 00:05:02.280
very trivial,

00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:07.420
so we don't have to really get another example for the same const follows is to declare a

00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:09.080
variable such as name,

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.510
But you have assign a value to that.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:12.780
Something like this.

00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:13.420
Well,

00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:13.760
later,

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.990
If you treat toe change the value it's gonna give an editor,

00:05:16.990 --> 00:05:17.920
for example,

00:05:17.920 --> 00:05:18.840
that first friend,

00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:22.740
the value off name and the name is and then I tried name.

00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:25.090
So it's gonna print the value.

00:05:25.090 --> 00:05:26.300
So without any problems,

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:28.650
name is we know.

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:36.670
But if I say name equals toe name dot to a court case now,

00:05:36.670 --> 00:05:42.890
you can see that this is going to cause a problem when we're on this.

00:05:42.890 --> 00:05:44.770
It is your assignment.

00:05:44.770 --> 00:05:50.750
A constant variable is not a lower in line number 14 where I'm tryingto areas in the value

00:05:50.750 --> 00:05:55.560
So constant basically means that the value for a variable can be hasn't only once,

00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.060
and it has to be assigned at the time of declaration itself.

00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:03.320
So I got into the year six tenders a better practices.

00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:06.740
Prefer to use const over lead butt in kill.

00:06:06.740 --> 00:06:08.460
If the value of a variable changes,

00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:10.850
then prefer to use let over war
