00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.540
Bootstrap by default is intended to give us

00:00:03.540 --> 00:00:07.155
a nice looking styles and features out of the box.

00:00:07.155 --> 00:00:11.250
But there is sometimes when we may need to override these defaults,

00:00:11.250 --> 00:00:15.000
not only to make our site look more like we want it to,

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.470
but also so our site doesn't look the same as all of the Bootstrap projects out there.

00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:25.440
This is pretty easy to do and no more difficult.

00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:28.230
Now, I'm going to apply in a regular CSS.

00:00:28.230 --> 00:00:29.850
If we go to our project,

00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.525
we already have our own custom styles.css file,

00:00:33.525 --> 00:00:35.400
which we created earlier.

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.310
I'm going to also have multiple options when it comes

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:41.274
to customizing the Bootstrap defaults.

00:00:41.274 --> 00:00:46.235
If we go to our index.html and then up to the top head section.

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:48.380
One important thing to note here is,

00:00:48.380 --> 00:00:51.140
our link to our custom stylesheets.

00:00:51.140 --> 00:00:56.210
This always needs to be placed as the last CSS file below any of

00:00:56.210 --> 00:00:58.370
the Bootstrap files and any of

00:00:58.370 --> 00:01:02.680
the CSS files which you may have from third party libraries.

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.825
This ensures that its loaded last,

00:01:05.825 --> 00:01:10.910
and therefore the contents will override any styling from the both files.

00:01:10.910 --> 00:01:15.545
So one way to customize this is to use a custom class.

00:01:15.545 --> 00:01:19.625
For example, if you wanted to change the navbar,

00:01:19.625 --> 00:01:23.945
we could simply add our own custom class inside of here.

00:01:23.945 --> 00:01:27.130
Let's go for productivity nav.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:32.015
We can grab this class and we can to take this over to our custom styles.

00:01:32.015 --> 00:01:33.980
So save our index file.

00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.530
Open up our styles.css.

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.300
Since it is a class we need the dot.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:44.740
We can then targets our custom class with any CSS properties which we would like.

00:01:44.740 --> 00:01:49.760
As an example, we can just simply change the background to be a value.

00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:52.430
Let's go for DDD.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:55.370
Save this, add over to the browser,

00:01:55.370 --> 00:01:59.570
go to the homepage and now we can see our custom background color.

00:01:59.570 --> 00:02:05.585
Another way to override any Bootstraps styling is to simply target the element name,

00:02:05.585 --> 00:02:07.810
or a more general approach.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:10.670
For example, rather than adding a class,

00:02:10.670 --> 00:02:16.205
we can use some regular CSS by targeting any of these HTML elements.

00:02:16.205 --> 00:02:22.040
If we wanted to apply a custom background to any of our dev's on the page.

00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:25.880
We could simply add a dev selector for a custom field,

00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:31.315
reload the browser, and this is now applied to all devs on our site.

00:02:31.315 --> 00:02:33.410
So this is not a great looking example,

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:36.380
but it's a way we can override any of the defaults,

00:02:36.380 --> 00:02:38.870
and another way to do this is to use any of

00:02:38.870 --> 00:02:43.675
the existing Bootstrap classes and then we can add to or override.

00:02:43.675 --> 00:02:47.620
For example, if we go to our contacts.html,

00:02:47.620 --> 00:02:52.745
all of the inputs which we've added have had this class of form control.

00:02:52.745 --> 00:02:57.355
Then grab this and use this inside of our own styles.css.

00:02:57.355 --> 00:03:02.655
Let's remove this, we then target in form control class from Bootstrap.

00:03:02.655 --> 00:03:06.200
When doing this all of the existing form control styles

00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:10.040
will still apply since we're using the Bootstrap style sheets.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.115
But since our style sheet is included last,

00:03:13.115 --> 00:03:16.160
anything which we add inside of here will either add

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:19.750
to or override any of these Bootstrap defaults.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:21.470
For example, if at all,

00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:24.620
all of our form inputs needed some extra padding,

00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:29.920
we could add 30 pixels to the top and bottom and zero on the left and right,

00:03:29.920 --> 00:03:33.350
and we may also want to remove all of the border-radiuses on

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:38.710
our site and we could easily do this by setting this to be a value of zero.

00:03:38.710 --> 00:03:42.865
Save this add over to our Contact Us page.

00:03:42.865 --> 00:03:45.500
We now have the sharp square corners on

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:49.235
our inputs and small padding on the top and bottom.

00:03:49.235 --> 00:03:53.720
If we go into the developer tools we would right-click and inspect.

00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:56.855
That's like one of our inputs.

00:03:56.855 --> 00:04:03.665
We can see our custom styles.css has our padding and border-radius applied up at the top.

00:04:03.665 --> 00:04:05.510
Also the form control,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.045
which is applied by Bootstrap style sheets,

00:04:08.045 --> 00:04:11.120
still has all of these properties taking effect.

00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:16.220
However, if we take look at the padding and also the border-radius both of

00:04:16.220 --> 00:04:18.290
these properties have been crossed out

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:21.755
since we're now use now a custom styles just above.

00:04:21.755 --> 00:04:26.360
This means that although we're using Bootstrap as a base for our project,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:28.475
we are not limited by it.

00:04:28.475 --> 00:04:35.160
We can also create any custom features and also a fully custom look and feel.
