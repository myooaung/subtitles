00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.800
If you've understood everything we've done so far during this course,

00:00:04.800 --> 00:00:08.654
this video shouldn't shock you or cause you any problems.

00:00:08.654 --> 00:00:14.100
We're going to create a new section but this time focused on adding images.

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.690
Just like with the rest of the bootstrap sections we've looked at.

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:22.125
We're going to begin by adding in our HTML

00:00:22.125 --> 00:00:26.250
and then we can integrate bootstrap by adding some CSS classes.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:31.060
On Bootstrap we may also add some JavaScript in the background too.

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.050
Before we begins to look at images we need to add some small project to work with.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:40.365
Provided with this course is a images folder,

00:00:40.365 --> 00:00:41.940
which you are free to use.

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.870
Or you can download your own if you prefer.

00:00:44.870 --> 00:00:51.330
These images folder is on my desktop and I want to drag this into our project folder.

00:00:52.220 --> 00:00:56.285
If we head over to the finished version and take a look at this.

00:00:56.285 --> 00:00:59.090
This is the icon section that we just created.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.080
Just below this, this is the section which we are going to create now.

00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.660
All of these four images are provided with

00:01:05.660 --> 00:01:10.315
the course along with a actual on-call sample.jpg.

00:01:10.315 --> 00:01:15.350
This will not be included in the final project but instead to

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:20.695
try out some new classes which we can use on images and we can take a look at this now.

00:01:20.695 --> 00:01:24.450
So to the project, first of all in the cyber we have

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.835
our four images and then we have our sample.jpg.

00:01:28.835 --> 00:01:32.285
We can check this out in our index.html.

00:01:32.285 --> 00:01:36.800
So let's include this anywhere at the bottom of the page.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.445
We can include a standard HTML tag,

00:01:40.445 --> 00:01:46.380
so this is stored in the Images folder and then the sample.jpg.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:49.844
If we now go to our project,

00:01:49.844 --> 00:01:53.610
reload, this is the sample image.

00:01:53.610 --> 00:01:57.065
If we shrink the browser down to a smaller size,

00:01:57.065 --> 00:02:02.310
you will notice that the image disappears off the edge of the browser.

00:02:02.350 --> 00:02:06.050
This is generally not something which we want to see.

00:02:06.050 --> 00:02:09.770
We want the image to be a 100 percent of the available width.

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:13.475
We can do this by adding a bootstrap class called image fluid,

00:02:13.475 --> 00:02:15.350
which is going to help us out.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.635
So lets add this to our image elements.

00:02:18.635 --> 00:02:25.040
So img-fluids and now when we reload the browser,

00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:27.350
the image should now be reduced,

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:29.860
fit the available screen size.

00:02:29.860 --> 00:02:32.660
We no longer see the image disappearing off the edge of

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.375
the browser and there's also a few more classes I want to show you.

00:02:37.375 --> 00:02:43.760
Many of them are not even specific to images with the work nicely with images anyway,

00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:46.700
such as setting the width of an element as

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:51.805
a percentage and this is something which we looked at before in the utilities.

00:02:51.805 --> 00:02:54.395
So we can add the image width,

00:02:54.395 --> 00:03:00.770
width w and then dash and as a percentage and we want to try out number 25.

00:03:00.770 --> 00:03:05.885
Reload the browser and this is now 25 percent wide.

00:03:05.885 --> 00:03:12.675
We can also change this to overvalue such as 50,75,100, and auto.

00:03:12.675 --> 00:03:18.535
Along with changing the w to be a h2 and this will affect the height of an element.

00:03:18.535 --> 00:03:24.070
Next, I'm going to copy and paste this line and then take a look at the rounded class.

00:03:24.070 --> 00:03:27.010
This rounded class will apply rounded corners to

00:03:27.010 --> 00:03:30.010
our image and let's just make this a little bit bigger,

00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:32.390
so we can see more clearly.

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.180
This applies the radius on all four sides.

00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:39.880
If we wanted to apply this only to the top,

00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:41.275
right, bottom, or left.

00:03:41.275 --> 00:03:44.080
We could also change our class to be rounded top,

00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:46.235
rounded right, and so on.

00:03:46.235 --> 00:03:49.225
If we wanted the corners to be fully rounded,

00:03:49.225 --> 00:03:50.695
more like a circle,

00:03:50.695 --> 00:03:54.470
we could change this to be rounded, -circle.

00:03:56.210 --> 00:03:59.540
This will be more like a circle if the image has

00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:02.690
the same width and height but because the image is wider,

00:04:02.690 --> 00:04:04.565
it will appear to be more stretched.

00:04:04.565 --> 00:04:09.080
Another option we have which is similar to the circle is the pill.

00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:14.015
This will apply rounded corners and also leave a flat top and bottom.

00:04:14.015 --> 00:04:16.205
So let's take a look at this in action,

00:04:16.205 --> 00:04:19.915
refresh and this gives us the shape of a pill.

00:04:19.915 --> 00:04:24.680
Another image utility which we can use is the image thumbnail.

00:04:24.680 --> 00:04:31.910
So this is img-thumbnail and this will apply a border surrounding the image.

00:04:31.910 --> 00:04:37.050
Lets make this a little bit bigger it can be difficult to see.

00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.210
If we zoom in, we can see that the image has a border

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:45.175
surrounding all four sides along with a rounded corner.

00:04:45.175 --> 00:04:50.990
We can also use float with images too and this also applies to other elements as well.

00:04:50.990 --> 00:04:54.475
So for example, if we said float-right.

00:04:54.475 --> 00:04:58.550
This image will now flow to the right of the rest of the content.

00:04:58.550 --> 00:05:01.579
So this is just a taste of what we can do with images.

00:05:01.579 --> 00:05:05.765
As mentioned earlier, some of these classes, along with others,

00:05:05.765 --> 00:05:08.044
apply to lots of different elements,

00:05:08.044 --> 00:05:11.510
so we're not restricted to just using them with images.

00:05:11.510 --> 00:05:16.985
Now let's put this into practice inside of our projects by building a new section.

00:05:16.985 --> 00:05:21.300
Let's remove these sample images and as ever we are

00:05:21.300 --> 00:05:25.505
going to begin with a section which is going to have a class.

00:05:25.505 --> 00:05:27.995
This time I'm just going to use the container class,

00:05:27.995 --> 00:05:33.610
so it's not the fluid size and then also align the text into the center.

00:05:33.610 --> 00:05:36.605
Also, like with the other sections,

00:05:36.605 --> 00:05:42.200
feel free to make this you own and include any different images or text which you prefer.

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:45.720
Nested inside we have our row.

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:52.880
This row is going to be split up into two equal sections on medium devices.

00:05:52.880 --> 00:05:57.060
Let's go ahead and add our class names of col-md-6

00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:02.030
and we can duplicate this inside of our first row.

00:06:02.030 --> 00:06:04.535
Let's get to work with the first section.

00:06:04.535 --> 00:06:08.515
So this will be on the left-hand side on medium devices and above.

00:06:08.515 --> 00:06:10.040
A level two heading,

00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:14.719
which is for the text of multi-view calendar.

00:06:14.719 --> 00:06:20.195
So this is going to be the heading for our first image of on the finished site.

00:06:20.195 --> 00:06:22.205
This is the text which you see here,

00:06:22.205 --> 00:06:25.325
followed by AP elements and then our image.

00:06:25.325 --> 00:06:29.465
This is also the same on the wider screen sizes.

00:06:29.465 --> 00:06:32.730
But instead we have these side-by-side.

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:40.730
So after our heading, we can add a p element with a class which we used before of lead.

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:46.740
This will make our text standout and a text of never miss a date again.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:51.665
At the bottom, we can add our image,

00:06:51.665 --> 00:06:53.975
which is stored in images folder.

00:06:53.975 --> 00:06:58.180
On the first one I'm going to use is the calendar.png ,

00:06:58.180 --> 00:07:06.380
the old text of calendar icon and then the class name is going to be w 50,

00:07:06.380 --> 00:07:08.785
to make 50 percent wide.

00:07:08.785 --> 00:07:11.130
So this is our first section,

00:07:11.130 --> 00:07:13.365
so I'm going to copy our heading,

00:07:13.365 --> 00:07:22.650
our paragraph and also our image and then go down to our second section, at this end.

00:07:22.650 --> 00:07:32.655
The text in this one is flexible to do lists and I'll just make this a capital,

00:07:32.655 --> 00:07:37.360
the lead tag is going to be: clear tasks like a pro.

00:07:37.820 --> 00:07:40.950
The image, this time is going to be for

00:07:40.950 --> 00:07:45.550
our list and don't forget to change the old text too.

00:07:46.960 --> 00:07:50.420
So before we go any further with our row,

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:56.140
let's check everything looks okay and this is our first row, now complete.

00:07:56.140 --> 00:07:58.785
Back over to our text editor,

00:07:58.785 --> 00:08:01.040
we are going to create a second row.

00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.710
Let's start by grabbing our first one,

00:08:03.710 --> 00:08:06.215
since the structure will be the same.

00:08:06.215 --> 00:08:07.760
We can paste this in,

00:08:07.760 --> 00:08:12.620
still within our section and just like before,

00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:15.830
all we need to do is to change our text and the image.

00:08:15.830 --> 00:08:21.840
So the text is collaborate and then work with all the team members.

00:08:26.210 --> 00:08:32.325
The image is for the chat and also change the old text too,

00:08:32.325 --> 00:08:36.510
the classes can stay the same and the for phone,

00:08:36.510 --> 00:08:40.240
level two heading is note taking.

00:08:40.850 --> 00:08:51.750
The lead text is take notes on the go and the image is note along with the old texts too.

00:08:51.770 --> 00:08:57.065
So this all looks good, now we have our two sections inside of our rows.

00:08:57.065 --> 00:09:00.890
Let's go to the browser and see how this is looking.

00:09:00.890 --> 00:09:04.115
So this is looking good on the larger screens.

00:09:04.115 --> 00:09:06.900
Let's shrink this down.

00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:12.935
This is looking fine, maybe just some padding on the top and bottom of our sections.

00:09:12.935 --> 00:09:19.175
We can do this in our surrounding divs just after call-md-6 pudding y.

00:09:19.175 --> 00:09:26.770
Let's go for a value of four and we can make this equal on all four of our sections.

00:09:26.770 --> 00:09:31.860
pudding y4 and also the last one too,

00:09:31.860 --> 00:09:38.220
refresh and this is our images now added to our project.

00:09:38.220 --> 00:09:43.985
Great so now you know how to apply styling to images with Bootstrap.

00:09:43.985 --> 00:09:45.740
One of the great things too,

00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.530
as well as many of the classes which we've just

00:09:48.530 --> 00:09:52.400
learned will also apply to other elements too.

00:09:52.400 --> 00:09:56.125
We are not restricted to only use these with images.

00:09:56.125 --> 00:10:02.120
Finally, don't feel as though you need to memorize all of these classes as we go along.

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:05.210
If you gets stuck, all you need to do is to use

00:10:05.210 --> 00:10:09.150
the Bootstrap documentation as a reference.
