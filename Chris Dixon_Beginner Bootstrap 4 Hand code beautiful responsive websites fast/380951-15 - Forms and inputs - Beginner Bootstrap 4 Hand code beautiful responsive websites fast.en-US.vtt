00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.970
Forms and inputs are something which we use all the

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:06.540
time when visiting websites or using apps.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:11.355
They use to capture information or data such as our name,

00:00:11.355 --> 00:00:15.180
our email, passwords, or even a message.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:19.120
That this is what we are going to be looking at in this video.

00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:22.910
We are now finished with our pricing page,

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:26.975
we now have this Contact Us link to now link to a new page.

00:00:26.975 --> 00:00:29.870
We're going to be building something which looks like this.

00:00:29.870 --> 00:00:31.490
If we go to the final version,

00:00:31.490 --> 00:00:35.120
it's going to share the same navigation and head section.

00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:39.515
Then we're going to create a form just below using bootstrap.

00:00:39.515 --> 00:00:43.715
This is going to be created using HTML markup and a sever,

00:00:43.715 --> 00:00:46.185
we are going to be using some Bootstrap classes

00:00:46.185 --> 00:00:49.410
to give us a nice space timing to work with.

00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:54.259
After the project we can create a new file in the sidebar.

00:00:54.259 --> 00:00:57.985
Once again, this is going to be in the roots of our projects.

00:00:57.985 --> 00:01:01.645
It's the contact of our HTML.

00:01:01.645 --> 00:01:06.620
Since we'll be sharing the same navigation and also the header section,

00:01:06.620 --> 00:01:10.235
I'm going to copy the pricing.HTML file.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:12.400
Let's copy all of this,

00:01:12.400 --> 00:01:15.910
and then paste this into our contacts.

00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:20.960
Of course we don't need these sections that we just created in the last video.

00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.515
We don't need the cards section.

00:01:23.515 --> 00:01:25.340
I'm scrolling up even further.

00:01:25.340 --> 00:01:28.445
We also don't need the pricing section either.

00:01:28.445 --> 00:01:31.460
All we have is the JavaScript down at the bottom.

00:01:31.460 --> 00:01:33.695
Then I header section up at the top.

00:01:33.695 --> 00:01:41.710
We can change the page title and we'll say contact us.

00:01:41.720 --> 00:01:45.165
Now let's get to work on our form.

00:01:45.165 --> 00:01:48.540
Just below our header section.

00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:51.930
Above the JavaScript we want to create a form elements.

00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:55.205
This form element is going to have a Bootstrap class.

00:01:55.205 --> 00:01:58.805
Under this level, we can go on to the Bootstrap documentation.

00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:02.010
This is inside of the components.

00:02:02.010 --> 00:02:06.410
Then we'll go down to the form section to get some more information.

00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.740
There's lots of different types of forms we can use,

00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:12.650
all relative to the inputs which we're using them on.

00:02:12.650 --> 00:02:16.280
But most of them generally have a form group as a wrapper.

00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.910
Then inside we place our labels and inputs,

00:02:19.910 --> 00:02:23.315
along with some different options for laying out our forms,

00:02:23.315 --> 00:02:26.070
including a in line layout too.

00:02:26.070 --> 00:02:28.725
Let go back over to our projects.

00:02:28.725 --> 00:02:30.915
We can begin inside of our form.

00:02:30.915 --> 00:02:33.210
Let's add a class of container to

00:02:33.210 --> 00:02:37.925
our form and then give it some margin on the top with a value of four.

00:02:37.925 --> 00:02:43.940
Then inside here we're going to wrap each label and inputs inside of a div.

00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.510
This div is going to have the bootstrap class of form-group.

00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.500
This classic form group is going to give us

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.815
the required space in between each of our inputs.

00:02:54.815 --> 00:02:58.130
Then inside we are going to start by adding a label,

00:02:58.130 --> 00:03:03.625
which is going to be for our name to detect inside of your name.

00:03:03.625 --> 00:03:06.750
After this but still when inside of our form group,

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:08.895
we can add our first input.

00:03:08.895 --> 00:03:12.679
Again, this is just regular HTML with some Bootstrap classes.

00:03:12.679 --> 00:03:15.730
This is going to have the input type of text.

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:19.775
The bootstrap class of form control,

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:23.060
which is going to control the size in the padding,

00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:24.740
the colors on the border.

00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.170
Along with a nice transition in and out.

00:03:27.170 --> 00:03:29.560
Let me click on the inputs.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:33.470
After this, we're going to create a second form group.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.675
This one is going to be pretty similar.

00:03:35.675 --> 00:03:38.690
Well this one is going to be for our email.

00:03:38.690 --> 00:03:41.965
The surrounding class or form group,

00:03:41.965 --> 00:03:44.435
I will label nest it inside.

00:03:44.435 --> 00:03:49.260
This is the label for the email and the text of email address.

00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.205
Next up the input with the type of email.

00:03:54.205 --> 00:03:59.410
Just as both are going to be add to the class of form control to the input element,

00:03:59.410 --> 00:04:01.125
the id of emails.

00:04:01.125 --> 00:04:03.155
This matches up with our label.

00:04:03.155 --> 00:04:06.770
This is so, when the user clicks on the text of the email address,

00:04:06.770 --> 00:04:10.610
the input will become active so they can type into it.

00:04:10.610 --> 00:04:13.360
We also need to do this just above.

00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:18.080
The id of name so this matches up with our Name Label.

00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:25.740
After this, we can add the placeholder text of enter your email to reply to.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:28.100
Before we go any further,

00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:30.515
let's check this is working okay in the browser.

00:04:30.515 --> 00:04:32.720
Let's check our links are there.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:37.295
We have our link in the pricing page to the contacts.html.

00:04:37.295 --> 00:04:42.430
Let's check out the index page and open the top navigation.

00:04:42.430 --> 00:04:45.310
We have our contact link working too.

00:04:45.310 --> 00:04:48.870
To the browser, and into the project.

00:04:48.870 --> 00:04:51.265
Click on the contact button.

00:04:51.265 --> 00:04:54.695
We now have our name and also our address.

00:04:54.695 --> 00:04:58.100
You can see the transition effect when this is clicked on.

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:02.150
We can also add some placeholder text to our name too.

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.335
Let's go back to our contact form.

00:05:05.335 --> 00:05:08.580
We can add this into our input.

00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:11.920
Let's text of enter your name.

00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:17.705
We now have our two form groups.

00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:20.920
The next one is going to be a select inputs.

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:23.080
This is going to be so we can click on this

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:26.340
and select which plan the user is currently on.

00:05:26.340 --> 00:05:31.250
This once again, has the div with a class of form group.

00:05:33.650 --> 00:05:37.285
Nested inside, we start with our label.

00:05:37.285 --> 00:05:40.330
This is going to be for the id of plan.

00:05:40.330 --> 00:05:43.910
Only takes of which plan are you using.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:50.670
We then add our select inputs.

00:05:50.670 --> 00:05:54.400
This is also going to have the class of form control.

00:05:54.400 --> 00:05:56.885
Just like the other inputs.

00:05:56.885 --> 00:05:59.385
The id is going to be planned.

00:05:59.385 --> 00:06:01.890
This matches our label just above.

00:06:01.890 --> 00:06:04.400
Then nested inside of our select elements,

00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.920
we can ask our options to choose from.

00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:09.805
The first one is going to be free.

00:06:09.805 --> 00:06:13.570
We can add the text for free inside here.

00:06:13.910 --> 00:06:16.050
We can add fall options.

00:06:16.050 --> 00:06:21.030
This second one is going to be for pro with the text of pro.

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:23.950
The third one is business

00:06:25.370 --> 00:06:30.455
and the last one is for a general inquiry whether you are not signed up.

00:06:30.455 --> 00:06:34.320
We will say non-general question.

00:06:35.170 --> 00:06:41.070
Let's see how this is looking inside of our projects, refresh.

00:06:41.070 --> 00:06:44.880
There is also select input with our four options.

00:06:44.880 --> 00:06:50.720
The next input is going to be for the message area or the text area.

00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.210
Outside of our form group,

00:06:53.210 --> 00:06:56.220
let's add a new div.

00:06:56.270 --> 00:07:00.280
This time again the class or form group.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.699
The label, which is going to be for all message,

00:07:05.699 --> 00:07:08.460
only texted message too.

00:07:08.460 --> 00:07:12.650
Then we can add a text area with multiple rows.

00:07:12.650 --> 00:07:15.470
We can add our text area elements.

00:07:15.470 --> 00:07:24.000
The class is going to be form control the id of message to match our label.

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:26.170
We can set the number of columns if we like.

00:07:26.170 --> 00:07:30.490
But I'm just going to set the number of rows to be five.

00:07:30.490 --> 00:07:34.670
The last part of this form is to add a submit button.

00:07:35.190 --> 00:07:41.955
You got to have the type of submit and then some Bootstrap classes.

00:07:41.955 --> 00:07:46.705
The basic button styling and then the color of button info,

00:07:46.705 --> 00:07:49.850
and a text of send message.

00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.880
Let's test this out in the browser.

00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.515
We now have a message area which we can also expand.

00:07:56.515 --> 00:07:59.045
I'll send message button too.

00:07:59.045 --> 00:08:03.490
The kind of course, feel free to customize this form to suit your needs.

00:08:03.490 --> 00:08:05.020
We can create inline forms,

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:07.895
we can create more complex setups just like this,

00:08:07.895 --> 00:08:10.010
where we can include radio buttons,

00:08:10.010 --> 00:08:11.750
check boxes, address fields,

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:13.690
and so much more.

00:08:13.690 --> 00:08:16.910
As you can see, forms have many different options and

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:21.295
varieties and Bootstrap has covered for most of our needs.

00:08:21.295 --> 00:08:25.760
However, though we'd forms or any other components which we use in,

00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:29.705
what if we need to customize them to suit our project.

00:08:29.705 --> 00:08:34.080
Well, this is what we are going to look at in the upcoming video.
