00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.080
At some point when building a project, a website,

00:00:04.080 --> 00:00:06.780
or application, you may feel the need to add

00:00:06.780 --> 00:00:10.560
some icons to make it more visually appealing.

00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:14.325
In the past, I've built my own icons to projects,

00:00:14.325 --> 00:00:16.140
but I'm not a designer.

00:00:16.140 --> 00:00:20.250
So for me and it may be much more convenient to reach out for

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:24.795
a third party library to provide these icons for us to use.

00:00:24.795 --> 00:00:31.485
Bootstrap doesn't have its own built-in font icon library in version 4.

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:37.080
I'm going to show you now how we can integrate our project with Font Awesome.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:41.785
For my project, I'm going to be using Font Awesome,

00:00:41.785 --> 00:00:45.000
which is available from fontawesome.com.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:50.630
This has thousands of available icons for us to use and is also a free plan too,

00:00:50.630 --> 00:00:51.920
which I'm going to use.

00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:55.915
We can get started by clicking on "Start for free."

00:00:55.915 --> 00:00:58.700
You do need an account to get started,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.130
so you'll need to add in your e-mail address inside of

00:01:01.130 --> 00:01:05.180
this box and then click on "Create" on the right-hand side.

00:01:05.180 --> 00:01:06.980
I am already registered,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:09.285
so I'm not going to go through the process.

00:01:09.285 --> 00:01:11.015
What all you need to do is to add

00:01:11.015 --> 00:01:14.690
your e-mail and you will also get an e-mail confirmation.

00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:18.110
After confirming this e-mail and setting up your account,

00:01:18.110 --> 00:01:21.785
you will then be taken to a page which looks like this.

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:25.250
Once set up, this will give us access to a script which

00:01:25.250 --> 00:01:28.765
we can copy and add this into our own project.

00:01:28.765 --> 00:01:32.340
Let's grab this and go to our index.html.

00:01:32.340 --> 00:01:36.005
Looking at this at the top of the page in the head section,

00:01:36.005 --> 00:01:37.760
so I'm just going to add this above

00:01:37.760 --> 00:01:42.140
the Bootstrap CSS and this is all the setup which we need to do.

00:01:42.140 --> 00:01:44.989
Now we include icons into our project,

00:01:44.989 --> 00:01:47.710
we add this in as a HTML element.

00:01:47.710 --> 00:01:52.745
We go back to the Font Awesome website and then click on "Icons" in the navigation.

00:01:52.745 --> 00:01:55.460
We can check out some of the available icons and also

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.960
click on them to find out how to include them.

00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:00.960
With the free plans,

00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:03.750
there is the solid and the regular versions of

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:09.205
each icon along with the HTML code which we need to include in our projects.

00:02:09.205 --> 00:02:11.385
If we see a font which we like,

00:02:11.385 --> 00:02:16.415
all we need to do is to copy the HTML and then paste this into our index page.

00:02:16.415 --> 00:02:20.390
All we have here is AI element with a class name.

00:02:20.390 --> 00:02:22.585
First of all, we have FAR,

00:02:22.585 --> 00:02:24.985
which is for Font Awesome Regular.

00:02:24.985 --> 00:02:26.920
If we choose this solid option,

00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:30.860
this will be FAS followed by our icon name,

00:02:30.860 --> 00:02:32.855
which is currently address-book.

00:02:32.855 --> 00:02:36.910
This is the name which we need to change for each icon.

00:02:36.910 --> 00:02:38.610
Now we know how to use this,

00:02:38.610 --> 00:02:41.600
I'm going to go to our project and get started.

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:46.115
This is the section which I'm going to be creating now using Font Awesome.

00:02:46.115 --> 00:02:50.730
Of course, you can change these icons to suit your particular theme.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:57.245
We're going to get started with a container and then set up our rows and columns.

00:02:57.245 --> 00:03:00.910
At the very bottom just above our JavaScript,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:03.615
let's create our section.

00:03:03.615 --> 00:03:07.380
We're going to have a container fluid.

00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:13.950
We're going to also set the text to be in the center.

00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:17.010
If we say light background color with

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:22.115
bg-light and also set some margin on the top and bottom,

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:23.915
and also some podium.

00:03:23.915 --> 00:03:26.060
Let's begin with a level three heading,

00:03:26.060 --> 00:03:30.450
which is going to be the text of Power up with a paid plan.

00:03:33.220 --> 00:03:37.550
The next step is to create a div with the class row,

00:03:37.550 --> 00:03:40.760
which is going to be the container for our sections,

00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.045
also some margin on the top and bottom with a value of four.

00:03:46.045 --> 00:03:50.000
Then we can go ahead and create our individual sections.

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.605
On my finished version,

00:03:51.605 --> 00:03:54.970
I'm going to have five sections side by side.

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:59.525
Rather than including our sections with the number of columns,

00:03:59.525 --> 00:04:02.525
we can also simply add the class of col.

00:04:02.525 --> 00:04:06.485
This is a simple alternative which we're going to use when we want

00:04:06.485 --> 00:04:11.350
all of the sections to be equal on all size devices.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:16.965
Inside here, we can add the i element which we just seen on Font Awesome.

00:04:16.965 --> 00:04:21.645
We can begin with the class name to make the solid of FAS.

00:04:21.645 --> 00:04:27.640
The icon which I'm going to use to begin is fa_users.

00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.095
Another class which is available using Font Awesome is the sizing.

00:04:33.095 --> 00:04:39.960
We can access the sizing with fa and then multiply this by five with 5x.

00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:46.735
This is equal to 5m and this also size is available up to 10x.

00:04:46.735 --> 00:04:50.450
Each one of my sections also has some texts just below.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.465
The first one is Multiple users,

00:04:53.465 --> 00:04:56.730
which I'm going to add in a p element.

00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.750
Then some space in or some padding on the top and

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:06.955
bottom of our icon to separate this from our text.

00:05:06.955 --> 00:05:10.320
Now this first section is completed.

00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.520
Let's go to the browser and reload.

00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:17.565
Now since we only have one col section,

00:05:17.565 --> 00:05:19.830
this is now placed in the center.

00:05:19.830 --> 00:05:22.140
When we add more of the sections,

00:05:22.140 --> 00:05:25.220
they will all take up the same available space.

00:05:25.220 --> 00:05:28.910
Let's do this. Now we have four more sections to add in.

00:05:28.910 --> 00:05:31.880
I'm going to copy this col section,

00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:34.415
paste this just below.

00:05:34.415 --> 00:05:42.130
The icon I'm going to use is palette with the text of advanced theming.

00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:49.250
This should now take up the same amount of space as the first one.

00:05:49.250 --> 00:05:51.960
Now we just need to add three more.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:54.460
Paste another one in.

00:05:54.460 --> 00:05:58.310
The third icon is going to be for the globe and

00:05:58.310 --> 00:06:03.000
the text which is just below is going to be multi-language support.

00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:09.770
The next icon is going to be for the sync.

00:06:09.770 --> 00:06:18.180
This is S-Y-N-C and the text of sync across all devices.

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:24.410
Then finally, the last one is going to be for customisable templates.

00:06:24.410 --> 00:06:28.770
This one is going to have the icon of file Alt.

00:06:34.070 --> 00:06:36.795
Let's check this out in the browser.

00:06:36.795 --> 00:06:38.910
We have our five equal columns.

00:06:38.910 --> 00:06:40.545
If we shrink this down,

00:06:40.545 --> 00:06:45.465
equal sections will try to keep an equal spacing on all screen devices,

00:06:45.465 --> 00:06:51.105
unless there isn't enough screen space available where they will drop onto a new line.

00:06:51.105 --> 00:06:55.250
You may also notice a difference in the icon color for

00:06:55.250 --> 00:07:00.205
my final version and this is something which we can set in our own style sheet.

00:07:00.205 --> 00:07:02.960
Just like with any finales in Bootstrap,

00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:07.790
we can apply our own style sheet to override any of the classes.

00:07:07.790 --> 00:07:15.000
In our project, I'm going to create a new file called as the styles.css.

00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:16.920
Then in our index page,

00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.960
we can link this in the head section.

00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:24.645
Add our link below the Bootstrap CSS.

00:07:24.645 --> 00:07:28.335
The file path is simply styles.css.

00:07:28.335 --> 00:07:30.850
We can then open this up.

00:07:30.980 --> 00:07:35.745
Then all we need to do is to target our icons which is the i element,

00:07:35.745 --> 00:07:37.625
and then set the color.

00:07:37.625 --> 00:07:39.980
The color I'm going to choose is

00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:49.210
40b7ad giving us the green color just like the final version.

00:07:49.250 --> 00:07:55.325
Adding icons for a project or application can make a real big impact visually,

00:07:55.325 --> 00:08:00.685
and we don't need to be a designer or spend lots of money to make them look good either.

00:08:00.685 --> 00:08:02.660
Next up in the next video,

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:09.690
we're going to continue with our project by looking at adding images and image utilities.
