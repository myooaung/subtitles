00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.260
Maybe you've taken this course and not a 100 percent sure what Bootstrap is.

00:00:07.260 --> 00:00:09.090
Or maybe you've heard of it before,

00:00:09.090 --> 00:00:13.350
but don't fully understand what role it plays in a web project.

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.145
Well, I'm now going to give you an overview of what Bootstrap can do.

00:00:17.145 --> 00:00:19.770
We won't be going too deep at the moment,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.085
since I think some things are better demonstrated as we go.

00:00:23.085 --> 00:00:26.910
But we can at least get a basic understanding.

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.770
When starting out with anything new, generally,

00:00:30.770 --> 00:00:33.650
the first thing we want to know is what exactly is

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:37.195
it and how can it benefit our projects?

00:00:37.195 --> 00:00:41.150
With Bootstrap, which is currently on version four.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:44.255
You can think of this as a toolkit for building HTML,

00:00:44.255 --> 00:00:47.450
CSS, and JavaScript projects.

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:53.840
We can build websites and applications using our existing HTML and CSS skills.

00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:56.795
In fact, we don't even need to know JavaScript

00:00:56.795 --> 00:01:01.750
upfront to get started and take advantage of the Bootstrap features.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:06.260
With Bootstrap, we don't need to learn a new programming language.

00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:10.430
It's not a complicated framework or anything like that.

00:01:10.430 --> 00:01:15.335
It's simply build on our existing skills and it adds some nice features,

00:01:15.335 --> 00:01:18.685
generally by adding some CSS classes.

00:01:18.685 --> 00:01:25.265
So we could think of Bootstrap as a helping hand for our websites or applications.

00:01:25.265 --> 00:01:31.195
We can simply drop it into our projects and we'll find out how to do this very soon.

00:01:31.195 --> 00:01:36.970
Another great feature of Bootstrap is it's full responsive by default.

00:01:36.970 --> 00:01:40.555
Meaning it will look great on all screen sizes.

00:01:40.555 --> 00:01:44.390
So if we're using a small mobile size device, as we see here,

00:01:44.390 --> 00:01:47.150
we'll generally have the content stacked top to

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:51.115
bottom or vertically on the full width of the screen.

00:01:51.115 --> 00:01:54.065
Once we have more available screen space,

00:01:54.065 --> 00:01:56.434
such as a tablet or a desktop,

00:01:56.434 --> 00:01:59.450
we may have the content stacked side-by-side,

00:01:59.450 --> 00:02:02.365
since you have more available width.

00:02:02.365 --> 00:02:09.775
Another great feature of Bootstrap is it allows us to develop at a much faster rate.

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:14.165
It does this by providing us with a base CSS and JavaScript,

00:02:14.165 --> 00:02:19.715
which we can drop into our project and use as a great starting point.

00:02:19.715 --> 00:02:24.830
The base CSS provides some sensible defaults which we may need,

00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:26.915
such as some spacing,

00:02:26.915 --> 00:02:28.805
some paddings and margins,

00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:32.125
and some default colors and fonts.

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:35.780
Everything which we use from the base CSS and

00:02:35.780 --> 00:02:39.475
JavaScript files can be fully customized too.

00:02:39.475 --> 00:02:43.370
This is because we don't want every single Bootstrap projects,

00:02:43.370 --> 00:02:46.445
the we create, or other people create too,

00:02:46.445 --> 00:02:48.500
to look exactly the same.

00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:53.570
So Bootstrap gives us the flexibility to modify every single style

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.160
or class that we apply to our project and make it completely our own.

00:02:59.260 --> 00:03:03.640
Another good thing about Bootstrap is it's beginner friendly.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:08.930
All we need to know up front is some basic HTML and CSS.

00:03:08.930 --> 00:03:14.755
We can then gradually implement bootstrap into our project when we need it.

00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:19.775
In fact, we don't need to know any JavaScript to get started with Bootstrap,

00:03:19.775 --> 00:03:22.055
the Mobile First Styling in,

00:03:22.055 --> 00:03:25.850
and things such as a drop-down menu, carousels,

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:31.070
modals, or progress spinners are all really straightforward to add into our project.

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:34.600
We don't need to know any JavaScript before we use it.

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:38.230
So this is a basic overview of what Bootstrap is.

00:03:38.230 --> 00:03:42.480
Of course, will dive a lot more deeper throughout this course.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:49.270
I'm currently on the Bootstrap homepage, which is getbootstrap.com.

00:03:49.270 --> 00:03:51.785
Inside the nav bar up at the top,

00:03:51.785 --> 00:03:54.740
we can see we are currently on version four

00:03:54.740 --> 00:03:58.445
and there is also references to version two and three.

00:03:58.445 --> 00:04:03.205
With version three still being actively maintained and used in many places.

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:07.475
But for this course, we're going to focus on version four.

00:04:07.475 --> 00:04:09.980
Once you know one major version,

00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:11.600
however, to be honest,

00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.155
it's not too difficult to use a newer version if you need to work on an older project.

00:04:17.155 --> 00:04:23.345
Most of the core concepts are the same and the documentation is pretty good too.

00:04:23.345 --> 00:04:27.215
Also in the navigation is an examples link.

00:04:27.215 --> 00:04:28.730
If we head over to here,

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:31.805
we can see many examples such as an album,

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:35.510
pricing, a checkout page, a product page,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:37.750
and a carousel for example,

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:42.005
and if we want to take advantage of any of these starter templates,

00:04:42.005 --> 00:04:44.870
all we need to do is to click on the example.

00:04:44.870 --> 00:04:47.870
We can then right-click and then go to

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:52.475
View Page Source and this will open up in a new tab.

00:04:52.475 --> 00:04:55.970
We can then grab all the code from here by copying and

00:04:55.970 --> 00:04:59.930
pasting and take this over to our own project.

00:04:59.930 --> 00:05:06.635
This is a useful starter for many types of pages and you also free to edit as required.

00:05:06.635 --> 00:05:08.600
If we go back over to the templates,

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.185
we can see an example of some of the Bootstrap components.

00:05:12.185 --> 00:05:17.545
We have a top navigation with our links and also our search box at the top.

00:05:17.545 --> 00:05:20.180
This is a pre built components using

00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:24.190
Bootstrap and there is also many of our varieties too.

00:05:24.190 --> 00:05:30.575
Below this we have a rotating carousel where we can add different images and also text.

00:05:30.575 --> 00:05:34.040
We can scroll between them using these left and right buttons.

00:05:34.040 --> 00:05:38.315
On the previous page shows many examples of what Bootstrap can do.

00:05:38.315 --> 00:05:42.730
I'm going to also use many of these components as we go through the course.

00:05:42.730 --> 00:05:46.035
So this is a visual look of what Bootstrap can do.

00:05:46.035 --> 00:05:48.880
But how does Bootstrap work?

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.700
We begin with regular HTML.

00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.945
So there is no new languages or skills to learn.

00:05:56.945 --> 00:06:01.180
Most of it is just a case of adding some CSS classes.

00:06:01.180 --> 00:06:07.490
Here on this slide is just a regular HTML unordered list with some list items inside.

00:06:07.490 --> 00:06:09.650
Even when using Bootstrap,

00:06:09.650 --> 00:06:12.730
we start with the same regular HTML.

00:06:12.730 --> 00:06:19.590
Down at the bottom, we see what is displayed inside the browser by this HTML by default.

00:06:19.590 --> 00:06:25.780
We have five list items looking pretty plain and with some bullets for each item.

00:06:25.780 --> 00:06:28.995
Here is the same HTML code.

00:06:28.995 --> 00:06:32.240
But this time with some Bootstrap classes added,

00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:35.105
the unordered list has two classes of

00:06:35.105 --> 00:06:39.020
list-group and list-group-flush along

00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.995
with the list items which have a class of list-group-item.

00:06:42.995 --> 00:06:47.630
Again, at the bottom we see what the output will be in the browser.

00:06:47.630 --> 00:06:49.280
This immediate looks better.

00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.110
We have some nice spacing,

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:52.565
a line in between,

00:06:52.565 --> 00:06:55.345
and also the bullets are removed.

00:06:55.345 --> 00:06:58.080
This is just a starting point though,

00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.785
so if we don't like something about the design,

00:07:00.785 --> 00:07:05.740
we can still overwrite any parts of it with our own custom styling.

00:07:05.740 --> 00:07:10.340
Bootstrap just gets us going with some default styles and best practices,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:14.260
which generally look good on all screen sizes.

00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.745
But what are these classes doing exactly?

00:07:17.745 --> 00:07:20.945
Well, the answer is nothing special at all.

00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:23.630
Just as when we write a class of ourselves,

00:07:23.630 --> 00:07:26.360
this just points to some CSS code.

00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:33.055
At the bottom left of this slide is the Bootstrap CSS or the list-group-item class.

00:07:33.055 --> 00:07:36.150
It just add some values for the position,

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:40.310
the display, adding, background-color and border.

00:07:40.310 --> 00:07:44.350
Again, we can always overwrite anything which we don't like.

00:07:44.350 --> 00:07:48.110
We also see the effect which bootstrap has,

00:07:48.110 --> 00:07:51.080
this is the final version of my project.

00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:53.524
If we go to right-click and inspect,

00:07:53.524 --> 00:07:55.760
this will open up the developer tools.

00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:59.210
We can see when we stretch the browser and also shrink it.

00:07:59.210 --> 00:08:03.250
That without the box Bootstrap is fully responsive.

00:08:03.250 --> 00:08:09.995
However, if we go into the head section and remove the link to the Bootstrap CSS.

00:08:09.995 --> 00:08:12.610
I'm going to delete this element.

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:16.325
We can see straight away that Bootstrap is being removed,

00:08:16.325 --> 00:08:19.820
we lose all of the styling and layout and also all of

00:08:19.820 --> 00:08:23.825
the responsiveness which comes with Bootstrap and if we reload,

00:08:23.825 --> 00:08:27.330
we can see that Bootstrap is now being reapplied.

00:08:27.350 --> 00:08:31.775
So this is what Bootstrap is and why we use it.

00:08:31.775 --> 00:08:37.170
Next up we're going to get started on our project by choosing your theme.
