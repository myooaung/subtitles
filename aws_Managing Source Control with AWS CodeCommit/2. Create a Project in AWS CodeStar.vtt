00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:07.545
Let's log into AWS and see how to create a CodeStar project from

2
00:00:07.545 --> 00:00:14.080
scratch. Under list of services, search for CodeStar,

3
00:00:14.080 --> 00:00:18.140
and this will take you to the CodeStar console.

4
00:00:18.140 --> 00:00:25.300
Click on Start Project, and you will land on the project template page.

5
00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:30.510
To your left, you have the option to filter the templates based on the

6
00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:37.670
application category or programming languages or AWS services. I'm going

7
00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:42.440
to choose a simple HTML project.

8
00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:46.070
You can see an error prompting that this user is

9
00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:50.840
missing the required privileges.

10
00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.740
Let's go to IAM and grant him the required privileges.

11
00:00:56.740 --> 00:01:06.440
Click on Users, choose Admin, click on Add permissions,

12
00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:15.340
attach existing policies directly, and search for AWS CodeStar.

13
00:01:15.340 --> 00:01:28.240
Let's select AWSCodeStarFullAccess and select Review and click Add permissions.

14
00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.840
You can see the new policy has been successfully applied to this user.

15
00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:44.840
Let me sign out as a root user and log in back as admin. Click on CodeStar,

16
00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:52.840
start project. Select HTML under programming languages.

17
00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.530
Choose the project template. Now that we provided the

18
00:01:57.530 --> 00:02:02.840
required access, we don't see the error anymore.

19
00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:06.340
Let's give the project a name.

20
00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:13.640
I'm going to leave AWS CodeCommit as the repository for this project.

21
00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:23.940
Click Next. And I'm going to let AWS CodeStar administer the AWS resources.

22
00:02:23.940 --> 00:02:28.140
Click on Create Project.

23
00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.840
You are challenged with a window to select an EC2 key pair.

24
00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.500
This is required to log in to the EC2 server that is

25
00:02:38.500 --> 00:02:42.950
getting provisioned as part of this project. Since I

26
00:02:42.950 --> 00:02:46.080
already have a key pair named test,

27
00:02:46.080 --> 00:02:53.540
I'm going to select that. Click on Create Project.

28
00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:01.660
Since this is our first project, enter a display name and an email address.

29
00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:08.240
Click Next. Select your default code editor.

30
00:03:08.240 --> 00:03:15.880
I'm going to choose Cloud9, but you have other options to choose as well.

31
00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:24.740
Click Next. And I'm going to select t2.micro as the instance for Cloud9.

32
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.780
This instance is just for our development environment

33
00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:31.440
and not for the entire project.

34
00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.840
You can provide environment name and a brief description.

35
00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:43.540
I'm going to accept the default cost savings settings.

36
00:03:43.540 --> 00:03:50.300
Click Next. Now that we have selected all the components, the project's

37
00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.690
set up, and provisioning is currently under progress.

38
00:03:55.690 --> 00:03:59.640
This may take a while to complete.

39
00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:01.840
Once the setup is completed,

40
00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:05.805
you can see the D for dashboard where you can access your

41
00:04:05.805 --> 00:04:11.340
Cloud9 environment, your team wiki.

42
00:04:11.340 --> 00:04:17.650
It also shows the latest commit that happened in the repository. To the

43
00:04:17.650 --> 00:04:23.720
right, it shows the endpoints and the project lifecycle that's collecting

44
00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:29.860
multiple AWS Services from source to deploy.

45
00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:34.310
Let's go back and set up our team. Currently,

46
00:04:34.310 --> 00:04:41.380
there is one user who is the owner of this project. As we saw before, an owner

47
00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:50.550
is one who can add other team members. Click on Add team member, select

48
00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:57.140
developer1, and I'm going to assign him a contributor role.

49
00:04:57.140 --> 00:05:06.850
Click Add and let's repeat the same process and add manager and assign him

50
00:05:06.850 --> 00:05:14.470
a viewer role. Click on Code to your left, and you can see a new

51
00:05:14.470 --> 00:05:20.310
repository with the name Globomantics‑P2 has been created, and a default

52
00:05:20.310 --> 00:05:24.540
set of code has already been checked in.

53
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.840
This was generated as part of the project creation process.

54
00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:36.130
A readme file at the bottom gives you a brief overview of the files,

55
00:05:36.130 --> 00:05:41.010
the structure, and how to edit the project.

56
00:05:41.010 --> 00:05:48.580
Let's go back to CodeStar and click on See my environments.

57
00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:54.330
This will let you access your Cloud9 environment. It may take a few

58
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.040
seconds until the environment is completely launched.

59
00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:04.740
Since this is the first time of me launching Cloud9 in CodeStar project,

60
00:06:04.740 --> 00:06:08.840
you can see that the repository Globomantics‑P2 is

61
00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.090
automatically getting cloned. Under environments,

62
00:06:15.090 --> 00:06:21.440
you will see a directory named Globomantics‑P2.

63
00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:24.825
Let's switch to the directory and go to the folder named

64
00:06:24.825 --> 00:06:31.040
webpage. Before making any changes, as usual,

65
00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:39.340
I'm going to create a separate branch named develop and check out this branch.

66
00:06:39.340 --> 00:06:46.840
Let me open index.html and make some changes.

67
00:06:46.840 --> 00:06:55.990
Save the file and exit. Let's add the file to the local branch, commit the

68
00:06:55.990 --> 00:07:02.840
changes, and push the changes to the remote develop branch.

69
00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:14.300
I'm going to go back to CodeCommit, click on Code, choose develop branch,

70
00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:23.820
select the file that we edited, click on Create pull request, provide the

71
00:07:23.820 --> 00:07:30.340
pull request title, and click on Create pull request.

72
00:07:30.340 --> 00:07:36.040
Since there are no merge conflicts, the Merge button is enabled.

73
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:43.910
Go ahead and click on Merge and Merge pull request. Now that we are

74
00:07:43.910 --> 00:07:51.750
in the master branch, let's go back to the webpage folder, choose

75
00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:57.690
index.html, and you can see the changes that we did in the Cloud9

76
00:07:57.690 --> 00:08:03.000
environment have been successfully merged from develop branch to the master branch.
