00:00:02.020 --> 00:00:06.460
Not every time you will be starting the project from scratch.

2
00:00:06.460 --> 00:00:10.570
Let's see a quick demo as to how to migrate an existing

3
00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.240
Git repository to AWS CodeCommit.

4
00:00:15.240 --> 00:00:21.317
I currently have that GitHub project named migrate‑demo, and we

5
00:00:21.317 --> 00:00:26.140
are going to migrate it to AWS CodeCommit.

6
00:00:26.140 --> 00:00:31.200
Let's open file1, and it's just a simple text file.

7
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.620
Let's log in back to CodeCommit console.

8
00:00:36.620 --> 00:00:43.130
I already created a repository named migrate in AWS CodeCommit.

9
00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.830
I just opened a Linux terminal, and we are going to clone the

10
00:00:47.830 --> 00:00:52.840
migrate‑demo project with mirror option.

11
00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:57.440
This option will let you copy all the refs as is.

12
00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:03.270
That means all the branches, hooks, and refs are copied so that we

13
00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.250
can push the entire repository to CodeCommit. Now, let's use the SSH

14
00:01:10.250 --> 00:01:17.330
URL after migrate‑demo and use the git push command to push all the

15
00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:21.140
changes to the CodeCommit repo.

16
00:01:21.140 --> 00:01:27.240
Let's go back to the CodeCommit console and open migrate repository.

17
00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:35.000
You will see both the files from our GitHub repo has been migrated to AWS CodeCommit.
