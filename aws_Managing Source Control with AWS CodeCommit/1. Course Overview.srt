Hello there.

2
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,230
My name is Saravanan Dhandapani, and welcome to my course on

3
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:14,490
Managing Source Control with AWS CodeCommit.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:17,840
I'm an architect working at Sabre Corporation focused on

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:20,660
middleware and cloud technologies.

6
00:00:20,660 --> 00:00:23,070
If you have worked on a software project,

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,730
I'm sure you would have a version control software like SVN or Git.

8
00:00:28,730 --> 00:00:33,500
AWS, being the industry leader when it comes to cloud software, has

9
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:39,350
plenty of developer tools, and AWS CodeCommit is one said service that

10
00:00:39,350 --> 00:00:42,910
can be used for source code management.

11
00:00:42,910 --> 00:00:43,970
In this course,

12
00:00:43,970 --> 00:00:49,820
we are going to see the core features of AWS CodeCommit and how to create

13
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:56,660
and manage repositories, AWS Cloud9 as an IDE for your development work and

14
00:00:56,660 --> 00:01:02,710
how to seamlessly integrate with AWS CodeCommit repository, set up

15
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:07,140
notifications and triggers, then notify changes that are happening to the

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:14,200
repository, create a new development project in AWS CodeStar and integrate

17
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:20,600
Cloud9 and CodeCommit, and, finally, perform a code review for the changes

18
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:25,970
that were pushed to the repository in AWS CodeCommit. By the end of this

19
00:01:25,970 --> 00:01:27,040
course,

20
00:01:27,040 --> 00:01:31,310
you will know all the features and benefits that are offered by AWS

21
00:01:31,310 --> 00:01:36,670
CodeCommit in managing version control of a software project and how to

22
00:01:36,670 --> 00:01:41,760
integrate CodeCommit with some of the other related services like Cloud9

23
00:01:41,760 --> 00:01:45,280
and CodeStar. Before beginning this course,

24
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,740
you should be familiar with basic Git commands, and exposure

25
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,540
to AWS management console is always a plus.

26
00:01:54,540 --> 00:01:58,940
I hope you will join me on this journey to learn about CodeCommit

27
00:01:58,940 --> 00:02:12,000
and its related service in Managing Source Control with the AWS CodeCommit course, at Pluralsight.
