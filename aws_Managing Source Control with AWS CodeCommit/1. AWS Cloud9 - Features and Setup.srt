Welcome to this module on Integrating AWS CodeCommit with AWS

2
00:00:06,550 --> 00:00:11,480
Cloud9. In this module, we're going to see how to configure

3
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,670
users with the required policies so that they can access AWS

4
00:00:16,670 --> 00:00:20,140
Cloud9. With the right policies,

5
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:24,040
you will see how to create a development environment,

6
00:00:24,040 --> 00:00:28,940
share the environment with other users for collaborative programming, and

7
00:00:28,940 --> 00:00:35,320
explore various other settings that are offered by AWS Cloud9. Then you

8
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:40,820
will learn how to connect the CodeCommit repository from Cloud9 environment

9
00:00:40,820 --> 00:00:44,000
and learn how to clone the depository.

10
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,510
Then you will see how to create a branch,

11
00:00:48,510 --> 00:00:53,940
perform changes, and commit the changes back to the repository all

12
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,310
from within the AWS Cloud9 environment. Before we start creating

13
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:04,700
the environment, let's quickly look at some of the key features of

14
00:01:04,700 --> 00:01:07,970
AWS Cloud9. Traditionally,

15
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:13,970
developers install IDEs like IntelliJ and Eclipse to set up their build

16
00:01:13,970 --> 00:01:17,090
environment. And every time they change their project,

17
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,270
they need to change their project setup manually.

18
00:01:21,270 --> 00:01:25,800
Since the IDE is installed in a developer's local machine,

19
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:29,440
the hardware configuration plays a significant role

20
00:01:29,440 --> 00:01:32,590
in a developer's productivity.

21
00:01:32,590 --> 00:01:39,190
AWS Cloud9 overcomes this problem by making your browser as an IDE, and

22
00:01:39,190 --> 00:01:43,560
you can code directly from the browser with the backing of a cloud

23
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:49,493
infrastructure. With many prebuilt environments that come as part of AWS

24
00:01:49,493 --> 00:01:55,040
Cloud9, you can easily start new projects.

25
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,250
AWS Cloud9 also makes it a breeze to collaborate with other users during your

26
00:02:01,250 --> 00:02:06,500
development process by sharing your environment with them. It provides a

27
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:11,110
seamless experience in developing serverless applications.

28
00:02:11,110 --> 00:02:16,990
You can create a new function from within the environment, run and debug

29
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:21,370
it and its related resoursces all by staying in your development

30
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:30,190
environment. There are many different ways your AWS Cloud9 can be set up

31
00:02:30,190 --> 00:02:32,970
depending on the size of the team.

32
00:02:32,970 --> 00:02:38,840
Let's quickly look at three different setups that are very commonly used.

33
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,710
If you are the only individual using your AWS account, you can use individual

34
00:02:44,710 --> 00:02:49,640
user setup. If you're a student and an individual user,

35
00:02:49,640 --> 00:02:54,500
individual student setup option is available. If you're part

36
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:58,640
of a team and if all of them are part of a single AWS account,

37
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:05,330
you will be using a team setup, and this is what you will see in this course.

38
00:03:05,330 --> 00:03:14,000
If you're part of a larger enterprise that has multiple AWS accounts, you'll be needing an enterprise setup.
