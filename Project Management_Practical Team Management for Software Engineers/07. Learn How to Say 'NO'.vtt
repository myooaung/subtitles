00:00:02.131 --> 00:00:07.131
Have you ever thought why did I ever agree to do that?

2
00:00:07.131 --> 00:00:10.381
Have you ever wished that you knew better on how to say no

3
00:00:10.381 --> 00:00:13.931
or even how to avoid volunteering to do something without

4
00:00:13.931 --> 00:00:15.131
suffering undue consequences?

5
00:00:15.131 --> 00:00:21.131
Do you speak up and seemingly risk your job by being the no person?

6
00:00:21.131 --> 00:00:23.131
Or do you just give in,

7
00:00:23.131 --> 00:00:27.202
resigning okay yes I'll do it because the executive just wants it?

8
00:00:27.202 --> 00:00:32.298
We have all been there and guess what, there is no magic bullet.

9
00:00:32.298 --> 00:00:38.131
But we can mitigate the angst with some techniques here.

10
00:00:38.131 --> 00:00:42.798
I learned a long time ago not to say no,

11
00:00:42.798 --> 00:00:48.131
but instead say yes, but… Here are the consequences of doing that activity.

12
00:00:48.131 --> 00:00:51.307
For example, yes, I can deliver by August 1,

13
00:00:51.307 --> 00:00:57.660
but we'll need to add 2 or 3 contractors or yes I can do this by October 1,

14
00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.208
but I will need to push out the schedule on another area.

15
00:01:03.208 --> 00:01:05.054
So every yes,

16
00:01:05.054 --> 00:01:10.131
but… needs to be followed by you saying the

17
00:01:10.131 --> 00:01:13.631
consequences that will occur to the customer,

18
00:01:13.631 --> 00:01:14.131
okay.

19
00:01:14.131 --> 00:01:17.881
It is important for them to fully understand the

20
00:01:17.881 --> 00:01:19.900
consequences or options as well.

21
00:01:19.900 --> 00:01:21.439
So here's another approach.

22
00:01:21.439 --> 00:01:24.131
I don't say no I say choose,

23
00:01:24.131 --> 00:01:30.131
that is choose one or more of the alternative options that might work for you.

24
00:01:30.131 --> 00:01:37.131
So yes, but… and choose are similar substitutes to saying no.

25
00:01:37.131 --> 00:01:41.131
Now you always want to demonstrate that you understand their request

26
00:01:41.131 --> 00:01:44.131
and are not just dismissing or discounting it.

27
00:01:44.131 --> 00:01:47.131
That's not good, that's not good customer service at all.

28
00:01:47.131 --> 00:01:50.593
In addition, you are showing ownership, in other words,

29
00:01:50.593 --> 00:01:52.881
yes I'm going to go do that.

30
00:01:52.881 --> 00:01:55.858
You're showing creativity by well here are some options and alternatives,

31
00:01:55.858 --> 00:01:58.767
and you're also saying well here are some

32
00:01:58.767 --> 00:02:01.054
consequences because the world is real,

33
00:02:01.054 --> 00:02:04.131
there may be some other consequences as well.

34
00:02:04.131 --> 00:02:08.060
There may be times when you actually have to say no,

35
00:02:08.060 --> 00:02:10.298
we get that, but yes,

36
00:02:10.298 --> 00:02:16.756
but… and choose are powerful and effective means to refrain the

37
00:02:16.756 --> 00:02:21.131
situations where you are facing unrealistic expectations.

38
00:02:21.131 --> 00:02:28.131
This has really worked well in my career and I hope it does for you too.

39
00:02:28.131 --> 00:02:29.823
Here are a few tips in helping you bridge the gap

40
00:02:29.823 --> 00:02:31.464
between reality and expectations.

41
00:02:31.464 --> 00:02:33.464
Set the expectation.

42
00:02:33.464 --> 00:02:37.298
Don't over promise, don't under deliver.

43
00:02:37.298 --> 00:02:43.131
If you set an expectation above what the customer needed,

44
00:02:43.131 --> 00:02:44.798
but failed to meet it,

45
00:02:44.798 --> 00:02:48.917
well you failed because in that case you have set the expectation

46
00:02:48.917 --> 00:02:52.131
with the customer higher than it needed to be.

47
00:02:52.131 --> 00:02:55.208
Find out exactly what the customer really needs,

48
00:02:55.208 --> 00:02:59.249
not the nice to haves, I even ask that exact question,

49
00:02:59.249 --> 00:03:03.131
is that a got to have or a nice to have?

50
00:03:03.131 --> 00:03:08.900
Most often than not they will be honest with you or maybe it's even a blend.

51
00:03:08.900 --> 00:03:09.669
For example,

52
00:03:09.669 --> 00:03:13.560
what of the five things they want for Friday really

53
00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:16.131
could wait until the following week?

54
00:03:16.131 --> 00:03:21.131
Well perfect, I can deliver those four, but I couldn't do the fifth one.

55
00:03:21.131 --> 00:03:25.131
Fortunately through those discussions we now have an

56
00:03:25.131 --> 00:03:29.731
attainable plan and we're on the same page.

57
00:03:29.731 --> 00:03:32.131
Also, explain potential obstacles.

58
00:03:32.131 --> 00:03:36.131
Problems happen, you can choose to respond in one of two ways.

59
00:03:36.131 --> 00:03:39.881
You ignore them or be all over them in such a way that the problem

60
00:03:39.881 --> 00:03:44.131
becomes a golden opportunity to wow your customers.

61
00:03:44.131 --> 00:03:48.362
Also a technique I like in all of my management and

62
00:03:48.362 --> 00:03:51.131
leadership activities is delegate up.

63
00:03:51.131 --> 00:03:57.131
So upward delegation can be a very powerful tool.

64
00:03:57.131 --> 00:04:01.131
This is when you go to your boss or your business owners,

65
00:04:01.131 --> 00:04:06.131
people above you in the org chart, for their guidance and help.

66
00:04:06.131 --> 00:04:09.593
So when things get tough, don't avoid those people,

67
00:04:09.593 --> 00:04:13.858
but instead reach out and embrace them head on.

68
00:04:13.858 --> 00:04:18.977
It may seem a little counterintuitive and it may be a little nerve racking.

69
00:04:18.977 --> 00:04:21.495
Some people may be afraid to talk to their customer

70
00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:23.131
when things get a little dicey.

71
00:04:23.131 --> 00:04:25.131
Next, leverage the influencers.

72
00:04:25.131 --> 00:04:30.202
You are working with CxOs or steering groups and business leads.

73
00:04:30.202 --> 00:04:34.131
There may be one or two of those people that you

74
00:04:34.131 --> 00:04:36.531
connect with and you can use as a mentor.

75
00:04:36.531 --> 00:04:39.404
Give them a call, tell them your situation,

76
00:04:39.404 --> 00:04:45.131
ask them for their guidance and even their help.

77
00:04:45.131 --> 00:04:47.731
They may take on the task of talking with some of the other

78
00:04:47.731 --> 00:04:52.977
big players in the company and by working together you can

79
00:04:52.977 --> 00:04:55.131
better set those expectations.

80
00:04:55.131 --> 00:04:56.798
Sometimes organization charts matter.

81
00:04:56.798 --> 00:05:04.131
If you are too far down the tree, they may not care or respect your position.

82
00:05:04.131 --> 00:05:09.131
Yes that is not right and not correct, but it happens.

83
00:05:09.131 --> 00:05:13.131
So by leveraging other influencers in the department or company,

84
00:05:13.131 --> 00:05:18.631
you might get some well needed help in managing your customer's

85
00:05:18.631 --> 00:05:21.858
expectations by seeking their guidance and support.

86
00:05:21.858 --> 00:05:22.313
Lastly,

87
00:05:22.313 --> 00:05:29.131
hope for the best and be supportive and optimistic with your team and customers,

88
00:05:29.131 --> 00:05:30.560
but plan for the worst.

89
00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.676
Maybe a better way to say that is always plan,

90
00:05:33.676 --> 00:05:34.767
have options,

91
00:05:34.767 --> 00:05:41.131
because things in general don't always turn out the way we expect them,

92
00:05:41.131 --> 00:05:45.131
and in particular the way the customer may expect them.

93
00:05:45.131 --> 00:05:47.313
So if you are struggling with your customers

94
00:05:47.313 --> 00:05:49.464
understanding of reality versus expectations,

95
00:05:49.464 --> 00:05:56.931
you might want to consider an SLA, that's a Service Level Agreement.

96
00:05:56.931 --> 00:06:00.131
Let's check them out in the next section.

97
00:06:00.131 --> 00:06:09.000
They can be a very valuable tool in setting and managing your customer's expectations.
