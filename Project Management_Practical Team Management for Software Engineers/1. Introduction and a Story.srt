00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
Hello, I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,500
I will be presenting the overview module in the course

3
00:00:06,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Practical Team Management for Software Engineers.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,000
But first, a story.

5
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:16,786
Okay, that's me wearing black.

6
00:00:16,786 --> 00:00:22,769
I was about 2 years out of graduate school and just loved to write software.

7
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:29,333
I worked for a major aerospace company, heads down and cranking out code.

8
00:00:29,333 --> 00:00:31,000
Life was grand.

9
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,000
Then after almost 1 year exactly after I started with the company,

10
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:41,000
my boss's, boss's boss said, got a sec and can you come into my office?

11
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,455
Well, uh sure.

12
00:00:43,455 --> 00:00:47,545
I wonder what he wants.

13
00:00:47,545 --> 00:00:50,000
Let's find out.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,250
Hey,

15
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,000
I think you've been doing a nice job and I would

16
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:56,941
like you to manage a team for me, maybe about 5 to 8 developers,

17
00:00:56,941 --> 00:01:00,333
and I would need you to work with the customers,

18
00:01:00,333 --> 00:01:04,333
figure out document requirements, determine your software development lifecycle,

19
00:01:04,333 --> 00:01:07,857
standards, manage work tasks, you know, et cetera.

20
00:01:07,857 --> 00:01:13,000
Come up with all the team management stuff you think you need.

21
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,000
Oh, by the way, you start tomorrow.

22
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:22,000
I was 26, I didn't know squat about the things I needed to manage my new team.

23
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,000
Well, here's what I was feeling.

24
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,273
Sometime between leaving his office and heading back to

25
00:01:31,273 --> 00:01:33,875
my cubicle panic started to set in.

26
00:01:33,875 --> 00:01:35,000
What just happened?

27
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:39,000
Well I got promoted, that's good, and more money too,

28
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,538
but do I even want to do the job?

29
00:01:42,538 --> 00:01:46,000
Well I was not asked, I was actually told.

30
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:48,000
Okay in a very nice way, of course.

31
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,000
But do I want to be a manager?

32
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,600
Can I lead people?

33
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
Can I set the right direction?

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,000
What tools and processes do I need to do the job?

35
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,786
Can I do the job?

36
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:02,000
Will I still be able to write some software?

37
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,923
Will I miss doing that?

38
00:02:03,923 --> 00:02:07,000
To be honest with you, I was overwhelmed.

39
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,000
I had never done anything remotely like that, just wrote software.

40
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,385
If you find yourself in a situation similar to this, then this class is for you.

41
00:02:16,385 --> 00:02:21,000
Okay, so I began to think about my next steps.

42
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,077
Let's see what they are.

43
00:02:24,077 --> 00:02:39,000
So I thought for a while and concluded that I needed two key critical skill groups of expertise to even remotely succeed in my new role.
