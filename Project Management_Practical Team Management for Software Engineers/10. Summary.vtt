00:00:01.026 --> 00:00:02.844
Okay let's recap this module.

2
00:00:02.844 --> 00:00:05.883
Building team structure, we learned that some structure,

3
00:00:05.883 --> 00:00:09.740
no matter how large or small your team is,

4
00:00:09.740 --> 00:00:11.026
is very important.

5
00:00:11.026 --> 00:00:13.795
We explored a few ways to structure your team,

6
00:00:13.795 --> 00:00:15.915
such as by customer, application, product,

7
00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:19.026
service or function, or even a hybrid.

8
00:00:19.026 --> 00:00:24.026
This enables parts of your team to be more customer or outward facing,

9
00:00:24.026 --> 00:00:27.662
and everyone knows clearly who is responsible for what and

10
00:00:27.662 --> 00:00:29.564
provides a platform for scalability.

11
00:00:29.564 --> 00:00:34.117
Next we learned that a role is a description for what you

12
00:00:34.117 --> 00:00:37.026
generally do each day when you're at work.

13
00:00:37.026 --> 00:00:43.026
Some examples may be manager, database administrator, software engineer.

14
00:00:43.026 --> 00:00:45.334
Also you must document in writing each role that is

15
00:00:45.334 --> 00:00:47.693
required for you to fulfill your job.

16
00:00:47.693 --> 00:00:52.026
Ensure each person knows their role or roles, and keep it up-to-date.

17
00:00:52.026 --> 00:00:56.026
Remember they're going to be used also for performance reviews as well.

18
00:00:56.026 --> 00:00:56.526
Next,

19
00:00:56.526 --> 00:01:00.795
a responsibility is a duty or collection of duties

20
00:01:00.795 --> 00:01:05.651
in the course of doing one's job, such as designing relational databases,

21
00:01:05.651 --> 00:01:10.026
providing technical leadership or performing business analysis.

22
00:01:10.026 --> 00:01:14.026
A collection of responsibilities makes up a role.

23
00:01:14.026 --> 00:01:15.693
Next, building team skills.

24
00:01:15.693 --> 00:01:19.426
We learned that not only are technical skills important,

25
00:01:19.426 --> 00:01:22.226
like the alphabet soup skills I mentioned,

26
00:01:22.226 --> 00:01:25.248
but also communication and leadership skills.

27
00:01:25.248 --> 00:01:31.526
These two other skill areas are, in my opinion, just as important.

28
00:01:31.526 --> 00:01:33.026
Determining skill requirements,

29
00:01:33.026 --> 00:01:38.226
we discussed my six step process on how to determine the skills your

30
00:01:38.226 --> 00:01:41.359
team needs and to create a basic training plan.

31
00:01:41.359 --> 00:01:46.526
I recommend you revisit your plan about each quarter or as needed.

32
00:01:46.526 --> 00:01:48.026
Informal training ideas.

33
00:01:48.026 --> 00:01:52.026
We learned about lunch and learns and how you can provide training in an

34
00:01:52.026 --> 00:01:56.026
informal setting and build team comradery as well.

35
00:01:56.026 --> 00:02:00.026
Also, presentation skills can be improved for the person presenting,

36
00:02:00.026 --> 00:02:01.257
a nice side benefit.

37
00:02:01.257 --> 00:02:04.526
We also touched on dinner and develop to help your

38
00:02:04.526 --> 00:02:08.026
team get started in a new technology.

39
00:02:08.026 --> 00:02:08.753
Next were vendor events,

40
00:02:08.753 --> 00:02:10.740
where vendors are talking about their products or services,

41
00:02:10.740 --> 00:02:15.641
but may provide a quick and zero cost way to learn about a topic.

42
00:02:15.641 --> 00:02:19.626
And lastly in this section we discussed how to grown your team's

43
00:02:19.626 --> 00:02:25.390
members skills and capabilities through on the job opportunities by

44
00:02:25.390 --> 00:02:27.935
giving them assignments and providing a mentor,

45
00:02:27.935 --> 00:02:31.795
team leader or even yourself to help guide them and give them

46
00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:34.359
the support and encouragement they need.

47
00:02:34.359 --> 00:02:35.693
Performance reviews.

48
00:02:35.693 --> 00:02:40.359
We discussed how performance reviews contribute to building team

49
00:02:40.359 --> 00:02:43.226
capabilities by determining the areas of improvement,

50
00:02:43.226 --> 00:02:48.026
which may drive additions to your training plan.

51
00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:48.776
Motivating your team.

52
00:02:48.776 --> 00:02:51.026
Yes there are many ways to motivate your team,

53
00:02:51.026 --> 00:02:55.026
from awards, thanks-you's, bonuses, et cetera.

54
00:02:55.026 --> 00:02:57.795
But a more subtle and systematic way is through

55
00:02:57.795 --> 00:03:00.390
aligning your team's work to the business,

56
00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:03.117
connecting your team with the customer,

57
00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:09.026
and providing consistent performance reviews and actions such as training.

58
00:03:09.026 --> 00:03:11.481
These management practices are not one-offs like an award,

59
00:03:11.481 --> 00:03:15.026
but instead an integral part of how you manage your team.

60
00:03:15.026 --> 00:03:22.026
The results are a team that is nurtured, content, motivated, and productive.

61
00:03:22.026 --> 00:03:30.000
In the next module we will learn how to acquire the right talent for you team. I'll see you there.
