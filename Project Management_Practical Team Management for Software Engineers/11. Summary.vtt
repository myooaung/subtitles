00:00:00.851 --> 00:00:04.851
Now let's circle around and review the benefits of alignment.

2
00:00:04.851 --> 00:00:07.137
Your team is working on the right priorities,

3
00:00:07.137 --> 00:00:10.934
that is a feel good experience to know you're not just

4
00:00:10.934 --> 00:00:13.851
doing busy work and your work matters.

5
00:00:13.851 --> 00:00:18.851
Next, your team is helping the business achieve its maximum potential.

6
00:00:18.851 --> 00:00:19.159
Again,

7
00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:21.928
a great feeling that you and your team are

8
00:00:21.928 --> 00:00:24.851
contributing to the success of the company.

9
00:00:24.851 --> 00:00:28.851
Your team will feel connected to the business.

10
00:00:28.851 --> 00:00:33.851
Sometimes IT feels they are not appreciated as they should be by the business.

11
00:00:33.851 --> 00:00:36.518
If you can tie everything you do to the business,

12
00:00:36.518 --> 00:00:38.684
not only will your team feel connected,

13
00:00:38.684 --> 00:00:42.851
others in the company will see the connection and the

14
00:00:42.851 --> 00:00:46.351
contributions your team is making, that's good for you and your team's career.

15
00:00:46.351 --> 00:00:49.851
This also improves trust and understanding between

16
00:00:49.851 --> 00:00:52.351
the business and IT personnel.

17
00:00:52.351 --> 00:00:54.351
Over the long term,

18
00:00:54.351 --> 00:00:59.851
your success is dependent upon positive relationships and trust is the

19
00:00:59.851 --> 00:01:02.396
critical component on enhancing business relationships.

20
00:01:02.396 --> 00:01:05.684
The moment you are not trusted by an individual or team,

21
00:01:05.684 --> 00:01:08.184
or senior management for that matter,

22
00:01:08.184 --> 00:01:11.351
your chances for success are diminished dramatically.

23
00:01:11.351 --> 00:01:15.476
Therefore, showing the business that you are listening,

24
00:01:15.476 --> 00:01:21.389
supporting and aligning their requirements builds a treasure trove of trust.

25
00:01:21.389 --> 00:01:23.697
This trust bank, if you will,

26
00:01:23.697 --> 00:01:28.351
may be leveraged for growing your team or enabling other

27
00:01:28.351 --> 00:01:30.851
business opportunities in your company.

28
00:01:30.851 --> 00:01:35.851
Okay, now let's summarize this module.

29
00:01:35.851 --> 00:01:37.669
Now let's summarize this module.

30
00:01:37.669 --> 00:01:39.851
Why align IT to the business?

31
00:01:39.851 --> 00:01:46.151
Remember according to Info-Tech Research 47% of business leaders

32
00:01:46.151 --> 00:01:50.851
feel that business goals are unsupported by IT.

33
00:01:50.851 --> 00:01:53.994
What this may mean is that the business may change the

34
00:01:53.994 --> 00:01:55.651
leaders of IT or maybe outsource IT,

35
00:01:55.651 --> 00:01:58.451
and that's if we look at it from an IT centric viewpoint.

36
00:01:58.451 --> 00:02:03.851
But from a business standpoint, the business just suffers.

37
00:02:03.851 --> 00:02:04.851
Understanding alignment.

38
00:02:04.851 --> 00:02:10.351
Alignment means that IT effectively aligns all of its work directly

39
00:02:10.351 --> 00:02:13.851
to business goals to achieve business objectives.

40
00:02:13.851 --> 00:02:20.851
This results in improved business outcomes that produce business value.

41
00:02:20.851 --> 00:02:22.351
Aligning IT team goals to business goals.

42
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:27.280
Now in this section we went through a complete example from a business goal to

43
00:02:27.280 --> 00:02:31.994
an IT project task or activity in a very visible format,

44
00:02:31.994 --> 00:02:35.851
easy for the business to see, read, and understand,

45
00:02:35.851 --> 00:02:39.851
and of course, easy for your team too as well.

46
00:02:39.851 --> 00:02:42.396
Defining priorities, we discussed sources of priorities,

47
00:02:42.396 --> 00:02:45.351
that is where they can come from,

48
00:02:45.351 --> 00:02:50.851
and the quality of the priority from vague to very detailed.

49
00:02:50.851 --> 00:02:52.051
Lastly, setting priorities.

50
00:02:52.051 --> 00:02:54.851
Based on your interpretation of the priority,

51
00:02:54.851 --> 00:02:57.124
from your customers and users,

52
00:02:57.124 --> 00:03:02.578
you could use an activity card and a priority grid to easily,

53
00:03:02.578 --> 00:03:03.033
quickly,

54
00:03:03.033 --> 00:03:06.637
and visually layout priorities and color code statuses to

55
00:03:06.637 --> 00:03:09.851
make it easy for the business to see, read,

56
00:03:09.851 --> 00:03:10.620
and understand.

57
00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:14.851
If you could have at least one takeaway from this module,

58
00:03:14.851 --> 00:03:17.651
everything we did is for the business.

59
00:03:17.651 --> 00:03:20.851
In your new role as an IT manager,

60
00:03:20.851 --> 00:03:23.851
it's all about helping the business be successful.

61
00:03:23.851 --> 00:03:27.184
So maybe before in a software engineering role,

62
00:03:27.184 --> 00:03:29.962
you were looking more into technology,

63
00:03:29.962 --> 00:03:33.851
now you're looking out towards the business.

64
00:03:33.851 --> 00:03:37.851
It's a different viewpoint and a different mindset.

65
00:03:37.851 --> 00:03:43.851
And if you do, it will only follow that your career with be successful as well.

66
00:03:43.851 --> 00:03:53.000
Now let's see how we can better communicate and keep our customers happy in the next module.
