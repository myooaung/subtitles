00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:01.540
Daily interactions,

2
00:00:01.540 --> 00:00:07.207
this might be the most important informal communication I have here in

3
00:00:07.207 --> 00:00:10.540
this section because it's happening all day long.

4
00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:13.207
So daily interactions are those actions,

5
00:00:13.207 --> 00:00:15.002
your behaviors, discussions, comments,

6
00:00:15.002 --> 00:00:20.540
attitudes and how you carry yourself all day long with your team,

7
00:00:20.540 --> 00:00:21.740
your manager and customers.

8
00:00:21.740 --> 00:00:23.540
So here are a few tips.

9
00:00:23.540 --> 00:00:25.254
Show appreciation a lot.

10
00:00:25.254 --> 00:00:29.540
The currency of appreciation is as big as a raise.

11
00:00:29.540 --> 00:00:33.540
For example, here's what I appreciate about you and your contribution,

12
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:34.790
and give a specific example.

13
00:00:34.790 --> 00:00:35.290
You know,

14
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:38.254
a basic attaboy or attagirl doesn't really work for those who

15
00:00:38.254 --> 00:00:40.540
put their heart and soul into their work,

16
00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:43.540
instead say something unique to your employee like I

17
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:46.540
appreciate the way you pull in people from other

18
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:48.540
departments to reach your team's goals.

19
00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.318
You're a good communicator.

20
00:00:50.318 --> 00:00:53.267
Managers need to notice employee's distinctive contributions

21
00:00:53.267 --> 00:00:56.540
and let them know that you notice as well.

22
00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.096
Sometimes showing appreciation in front of other team

23
00:01:00.096 --> 00:01:02.873
members also helps show them that you care,

24
00:01:02.873 --> 00:01:07.848
just be sure you do it for everyone, not just one or two.

25
00:01:07.848 --> 00:01:08.771
Yes, everyone.

26
00:01:08.771 --> 00:01:12.207
Even those who may not contribute as much,

27
00:01:12.207 --> 00:01:15.540
but they still contribute something and they have their niche,

28
00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:19.540
so find it and show your appreciation to them.

29
00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.267
Thank you!

30
00:01:20.267 --> 00:01:23.540
From the elevator to the parking lot represent opportunities

31
00:01:23.540 --> 00:01:28.040
for managers to engage in interactions and show appreciation

32
00:01:28.040 --> 00:01:29.540
for their employee's efforts.

33
00:01:29.540 --> 00:01:33.683
Public recognition at a staff meeting or a thoughtful thank you in

34
00:01:33.683 --> 00:01:36.540
a newsletter or email is also very meaningful.

35
00:01:36.540 --> 00:01:37.207
For example,

36
00:01:37.207 --> 00:01:40.540
sometimes in an email to an employee regarding a project

37
00:01:40.540 --> 00:01:42.228
I might add a little bit at the end,

38
00:01:42.228 --> 00:01:44.085
like - hey thanks for pushing out that software

39
00:01:44.085 --> 00:01:46.540
release every Friday for the team, I appreciate it.

40
00:01:46.540 --> 00:01:48.540
Also, what do you?

41
00:01:48.540 --> 00:01:53.790
Employees will withhold their best ideas for managers who always have

42
00:01:53.790 --> 00:01:57.540
the right answer or take credit for other's ideas.

43
00:01:57.540 --> 00:01:59.207
I hope that's not you.

44
00:01:59.207 --> 00:02:02.207
For example, managers need to proactively ask their employees,

45
00:02:02.207 --> 00:02:04.540
how do you think we could improve?

46
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:06.540
What's getting us stuck in this area?

47
00:02:06.540 --> 00:02:09.540
What do you love about the work you're doing here?

48
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:13.631
So establish a safe environment in which people have the opportunity to

49
00:02:13.631 --> 00:02:16.540
express themselves and be recognized for their ideas.

50
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:23.540
Yes, not all ideas will make a difference and be worthy to act upon,

51
00:02:23.540 --> 00:02:27.707
but provide that environment so they can share them and

52
00:02:27.707 --> 00:02:29.290
get involved in the organization.

53
00:02:29.290 --> 00:02:32.463
Alright, now let's see a few more ideas about daily interactions.

54
00:02:32.463 --> 00:02:38.267
Here are a few more daily interaction tips I can share with you.

55
00:02:38.267 --> 00:02:40.449
Here's what's happening in our department,

56
00:02:40.449 --> 00:02:41.540
in other words,

57
00:02:41.540 --> 00:02:46.085
organizations operate in a constant state of change and many

58
00:02:46.085 --> 00:02:49.813
times information is withheld from team leaders or just not

59
00:02:49.813 --> 00:02:51.873
shared properly until the last minute.

60
00:02:51.873 --> 00:02:55.232
This is an enormous distraction for some employees who need real

61
00:02:55.232 --> 00:02:57.540
information about their futures to be productive in their work.

62
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.790
Managers often underestimate employee's ability to accept

63
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:05.826
why if it is shared in an honest way.

64
00:03:05.826 --> 00:03:09.673
Also managers will gain more respect when they share as much as they know,

65
00:03:09.673 --> 00:03:11.540
as soon as you can share it.

66
00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:15.140
So real explanations are always better than no explanations,

67
00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:19.790
even if you have no information, be straightforward and honest and say - hey,

68
00:03:19.790 --> 00:03:22.540
here's what's happening and here's what I don't know that's happening.

69
00:03:22.540 --> 00:03:24.873
Alright, I have some feedback for you.

70
00:03:24.873 --> 00:03:29.540
Don't wait for the annual performance review to tell people how they're doing.

71
00:03:29.540 --> 00:03:34.540
Try providing real-time feedback right after an event or activity happens.

72
00:03:34.540 --> 00:03:37.813
A culture of continual feedback is healthy and agile,

73
00:03:37.813 --> 00:03:39.540
hopefully it's always good feedback,

74
00:03:39.540 --> 00:03:42.807
but if you need to offer some other coaching feedback,

75
00:03:42.807 --> 00:03:44.673
do it right then at the time.

76
00:03:44.673 --> 00:03:47.309
Don't let it simmer and don't let resentment build.

77
00:03:47.309 --> 00:03:48.463
Next, my bad.

78
00:03:48.463 --> 00:03:52.790
Here is something I learned the hard way, so to speak.

79
00:03:52.790 --> 00:03:57.040
Smart, capable managers who know their stuff are well respected,

80
00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:02.540
but employees like and trust managers who are not only smart,

81
00:04:02.540 --> 00:04:06.940
but can occasionally lean back and laugh at their own mistakes and

82
00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:10.540
who are generous with what life has taught them.

83
00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:12.540
Don't be afraid to show that you're human too.

84
00:04:12.540 --> 00:04:13.952
We all make mistakes.

85
00:04:13.952 --> 00:04:18.540
So what I mean by my bad is that, hey I screwed up,

86
00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:23.540
it's my fault, I'm sorry, I will take responsibility for the entire team,

87
00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.040
even though maybe one or two people on the team,

88
00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.957
you know, were part of it, nonetheless,

89
00:04:27.957 --> 00:04:32.540
take responsibility when anything goes wrong as much as you can.

90
00:04:32.540 --> 00:04:35.040
And the next, hello Danielle.

91
00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:38.254
Dale Carnegie said the following, I quote,

92
00:04:38.254 --> 00:04:41.826
"a person's name is to that person the sweetest and

93
00:04:41.826 --> 00:04:43.771
most important sound in any language.

94
00:04:43.771 --> 00:04:47.232
" Get to know your employees by name, that shouldn't be hard,

95
00:04:47.232 --> 00:04:49.540
in this scenario we have a small team of people.

96
00:04:49.540 --> 00:04:53.826
But I would get to know people's names in the broader sense,

97
00:04:53.826 --> 00:04:55.790
your customers, your suppliers, your management chain,

98
00:04:55.790 --> 00:04:59.207
and even if you know their name, use it regularly.

99
00:04:59.207 --> 00:05:02.540
It just makes them feel good.

100
00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:04.683
If the company is too big to know everyone's name,

101
00:05:04.683 --> 00:05:07.386
start with the people close in proximity if you can.

102
00:05:07.386 --> 00:05:10.740
There's no excuse for saying, I'm not good with names.

103
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.540
And I have used that line many times, it's not an excuse.

104
00:05:15.540 --> 00:05:18.540
So I'm working really hard to get the people's right.

105
00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:20.873
People enjoy being called by their name.

106
00:05:20.873 --> 00:05:29.540
Alright, now let's see what Mark Twain thinks about telling the truth.

107
00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:32.290
"If you tell the truth, you don't have to remember anything,

108
00:05:32.290 --> 00:05:34.407
" by one of my favorites, Mark Twain.

109
00:05:34.407 --> 00:05:37.540
The point of this slide is to always be honest and

110
00:05:37.540 --> 00:05:39.873
forthright at all times with your management,

111
00:05:39.873 --> 00:05:41.611
your customers and your team.

112
00:05:41.611 --> 00:05:47.040
Honesty builds trust and you can take trust all the way to the bank.

113
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:57.000
Avoid political spin and tell it straight. Be courteous and respectful in your communications and always be honest.
