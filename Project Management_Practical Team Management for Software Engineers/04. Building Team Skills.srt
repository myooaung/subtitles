1
00:00:00,087 --> 00:00:02,487
So now we have a structure to our team,

2
00:00:02,487 --> 00:00:06,010
we have defined the roles and the responsibilities and the duties,

3
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:11,087
we are now ready to build the skills necessary to accomplish our work.

4
00:00:11,087 --> 00:00:14,852
The determination of the skills is based on the gaps,

5
00:00:14,852 --> 00:00:20,516
a gap may be a role that no one can feel because that set of skills

6
00:00:20,516 --> 00:00:25,230
required is simply missing from your team or a gap maybe simply skills to

7
00:00:25,230 --> 00:00:28,087
be enhanced for a person in one or more roles.

8
00:00:28,087 --> 00:00:31,164
Do your team members, and yourself of course,

9
00:00:31,164 --> 00:00:34,178
have all of the capabilities and skills you think

10
00:00:34,178 --> 00:00:36,087
they need to get the work done?

11
00:00:36,087 --> 00:00:41,087
Let's explore those topics in this section.

12
00:00:41,087 --> 00:00:45,373
We as IT people tend to focus on the technical

13
00:00:45,373 --> 00:00:51,087
skills or alphabet soup of skills, such as HTML,

14
00:00:51,087 --> 00:00:55,087
XML, CSS, SQL, et cetera.

15
00:00:55,087 --> 00:01:00,087
To me there are three critical categories of skill areas.

16
00:01:00,087 --> 00:01:03,087
The first one is the obvious one of course, technical.

17
00:01:03,087 --> 00:01:06,723
Sure you will need to acquire new technical skills or

18
00:01:06,723 --> 00:01:08,887
possibly improve some that you already have.

19
00:01:08,887 --> 00:01:12,230
Typically new managers think that's all there is to it.

20
00:01:12,230 --> 00:01:15,087
This is a huge mistake in my book.

21
00:01:15,087 --> 00:01:19,087
Here are the next two areas you should not overlook.

22
00:01:19,087 --> 00:01:23,754
Communication skills, you need to write effectively,

23
00:01:23,754 --> 00:01:25,087
speak effectively,

24
00:01:25,087 --> 00:01:27,587
and interact effectively to lead your team and work with

25
00:01:27,587 --> 00:01:30,087
your customers and your management.

26
00:01:30,087 --> 00:01:34,087
And lastly, is the leadership skills.

27
00:01:34,087 --> 00:01:36,658
Now you have been chosen as the new manager,

28
00:01:36,658 --> 00:01:40,420
I would suggest to you that either you have some leadership skills

29
00:01:40,420 --> 00:01:43,754
already and that is why your managers have selected you,

30
00:01:43,754 --> 00:01:47,754
but I would strongly encourage you to grow your leadership skills.

31
00:01:47,754 --> 00:01:52,933
Also you want to begin growing and grooming your team members to

32
00:01:52,933 --> 00:01:57,087
all be leaders in their own right and context.

33
00:01:57,087 --> 00:01:58,420
So as you can see,

34
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:03,170
the technical skills to me is only one-third of the picture of what you want.

35
00:02:03,170 --> 00:02:06,887
Resumes tend to focus only on technical and it can be

36
00:02:06,887 --> 00:02:09,087
tough to figure out if the resume you are reading will

37
00:02:09,087 --> 00:02:11,087
represent all the skills you need.

38
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:14,287
We will talk about that more in another module,

39
00:02:14,287 --> 00:02:17,087
on how we acquire the right talent.

40
00:02:17,087 --> 00:02:22,087
Okay, now let's see some examples of each of these.

41
00:02:22,087 --> 00:02:24,187
Technical skills are the knowledge and abilities

42
00:02:24,187 --> 00:02:26,516
needed to accomplish mathematical, engineering,

43
00:02:26,516 --> 00:02:30,087
scientific or computer related duties,

44
00:02:30,087 --> 00:02:35,087
as well as the specific tasks relating to technology.

45
00:02:35,087 --> 00:02:38,087
Here are some examples, software development,

46
00:02:38,087 --> 00:02:43,198
like JavaScript, C#, Java, Angular, Python or MySQL.

47
00:02:43,198 --> 00:02:48,420
IT ops, like database administration, IT networking,

48
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:53,087
cloud computing or Microsoft Windows operating systems.

49
00:02:53,087 --> 00:02:59,087
Creative professional like game design, 3D design, Photoshop and web design.

50
00:02:59,087 --> 00:03:02,643
Data professional like Oracle, SQL and business intelligence,

51
00:03:02,643 --> 00:03:07,754
things wrapped around data or big data.

52
00:03:07,754 --> 00:03:13,587
Architecture and construction, like CAD, Rhino, AutoCAD and 3DS Max.

53
00:03:13,587 --> 00:03:20,087
And information and cyber security, like digital forensics and malware analysis.

54
00:03:20,087 --> 00:03:24,087
Those are just some of the examples and some of the categories.

55
00:03:24,087 --> 00:03:28,087
Now let's look at the communication area.

56
00:03:28,087 --> 00:03:32,632
As the technical skills are sometimes known as hard skills,

57
00:03:32,632 --> 00:03:36,087
communication skills are sometimes known as soft skills.

58
00:03:36,087 --> 00:03:38,309
Here are some examples.

59
00:03:38,309 --> 00:03:41,087
First, of course, writing skills.

60
00:03:41,087 --> 00:03:45,087
Employees obviously place a high value on excellent writing skills.

61
00:03:45,087 --> 00:03:48,837
In my experience I have found that IT people tend to have

62
00:03:48,837 --> 00:03:51,451
much to improve on with writing skills.

63
00:03:51,451 --> 00:03:55,087
You're going to be sending emails, writing proposals,

64
00:03:55,087 --> 00:03:57,754
presentations, developing business plans,

65
00:03:57,754 --> 00:04:02,723
all need good writing skills, and I don't just mean grammar,

66
00:04:02,723 --> 00:04:04,087
which is of course important.

67
00:04:04,087 --> 00:04:08,373
What I mean is that you are able to influence,

68
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:08,801
mentor,

69
00:04:08,801 --> 00:04:15,087
guide and shape the activities you are responsible for through those skill sets.

70
00:04:15,087 --> 00:04:18,087
Quality writing skills are critical for that.

71
00:04:18,087 --> 00:04:18,487
Presentations.

72
00:04:18,487 --> 00:04:22,444
Good presentation skills require a person to be able to

73
00:04:22,444 --> 00:04:26,373
stand up in front of a group of people, your team,

74
00:04:26,373 --> 00:04:29,395
your customers, and present your ideas, plans,

75
00:04:29,395 --> 00:04:33,087
and issues and be successful in doing so.

76
00:04:33,087 --> 00:04:33,587
Meetings.

77
00:04:33,587 --> 00:04:37,087
Meeting skills are harder than they look.

78
00:04:37,087 --> 00:04:40,754
You need to design an agenda, determine who should be invited,

79
00:04:40,754 --> 00:04:43,587
ensure the intended outcome is realized,

80
00:04:43,587 --> 00:04:48,087
track questions and issues, prepare and email notes out to the attendees.

81
00:04:48,087 --> 00:04:50,516
Now those may seem easy or even mechanical,

82
00:04:50,516 --> 00:04:56,087
but you need to lead and manage that team to a successful outcome.

83
00:04:56,087 --> 00:04:56,814
Stand ups.

84
00:04:56,814 --> 00:05:00,087
Stand ups are not just for software engineers anymore,

85
00:05:00,087 --> 00:05:02,587
I use them in almost aspect of what I do.

86
00:05:02,587 --> 00:05:08,451
But it makes a good listener and someone who can make people feel comfortable,

87
00:05:08,451 --> 00:05:08,996
trusted,

88
00:05:08,996 --> 00:05:14,702
and respected so that they in fact talk and share the important and critical

89
00:05:14,702 --> 00:05:19,087
information that the stand up was to expose in the first place.

90
00:05:19,087 --> 00:05:19,801
Walk arounds.

91
00:05:19,801 --> 00:05:22,301
Now walk arounds for me are impromptu,

92
00:05:22,301 --> 00:05:27,381
3 to 5 minute jaunts where you can get up and maybe get a drink of water and on

93
00:05:27,381 --> 00:05:30,230
the way back poke your head into an office or two and say,

94
00:05:30,230 --> 00:05:31,087
hey, hi, what's up?

95
00:05:31,087 --> 00:05:32,178
How are you doing?

96
00:05:32,178 --> 00:05:34,087
How are you coming on that assignment?

97
00:05:34,087 --> 00:05:37,020
Keep it more personal and casual and use it to build

98
00:05:37,020 --> 00:05:38,702
rapport with your team and customers.

99
00:05:38,702 --> 00:05:42,087
This skill is likely to be more for you or someone

100
00:05:42,087 --> 00:05:45,587
who may take your place one day.

101
00:05:45,587 --> 00:05:46,087
Interviews.

102
00:05:46,087 --> 00:05:49,164
We will cover this in more detail in another module,

103
00:05:49,164 --> 00:05:52,944
but good communication skills will be the main vehicle by which you will

104
00:05:52,944 --> 00:05:56,269
determine if the candidate is the right candidate to hire,

105
00:05:56,269 --> 00:05:58,087
in my opinion of course.

106
00:05:58,087 --> 00:06:00,087
And as I've said, more on that later.

107
00:06:00,087 --> 00:06:03,287
This skill is likely to be more for you or someone

108
00:06:03,287 --> 00:06:06,087
who may take your place one day.

109
00:06:06,087 --> 00:06:06,754
Interpersonal skills.

110
00:06:06,754 --> 00:06:10,087
These are life skills we use every day to communicate

111
00:06:10,087 --> 00:06:15,087
and interact with other people, both individually and in groups.

112
00:06:15,087 --> 00:06:18,087
People who have worked on developing strong interpersonal skills

113
00:06:18,087 --> 00:06:21,472
are more successful in their professional lives and if I might

114
00:06:21,472 --> 00:06:24,373
say their personal lives as well.

115
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:26,087
Everyone needs these.

116
00:06:26,087 --> 00:06:27,010
Here's a hint,

117
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:31,010
if you have great interpersonal skills you will go far in life professionally.

118
00:06:31,010 --> 00:06:35,516
So you can see I covered a plethora of communication skills and forms that

119
00:06:35,516 --> 00:06:39,087
you as a manager definitely require and must improve on,

120
00:06:39,087 --> 00:06:42,087
but also your team members should as well.

121
00:06:42,087 --> 00:06:44,856
These skills, I would like to suggest to you,

122
00:06:44,856 --> 00:06:52,087
may in fact propel your career farther than the technical skills.

123
00:06:52,087 --> 00:06:56,531
Leadership skills are an essential component in positioning

124
00:06:56,531 --> 00:06:59,269
yourself and team members to make thoughtful decisions about

125
00:06:59,269 --> 00:07:00,887
their team's mission and goals.

126
00:07:00,887 --> 00:07:04,087
Now this area is a bit more fuzzy.

127
00:07:04,087 --> 00:07:09,087
Some people are naturally good at leading others and some aren't.

128
00:07:09,087 --> 00:07:13,087
So I suggest to you the following question, is leadership trainable?

129
00:07:13,087 --> 00:07:16,911
I say it is in the context of this course and in your

130
00:07:16,911 --> 00:07:19,087
new role and manager of your team.

131
00:07:19,087 --> 00:07:22,420
On this slide I will list a set of skills,

132
00:07:22,420 --> 00:07:25,087
or maybe I like to call them behaviors,

133
00:07:25,087 --> 00:07:28,087
that you'll want to have in your skill set.

134
00:07:28,087 --> 00:07:32,087
The first is to be able to embrace and champion change.

135
00:07:32,087 --> 00:07:36,087
Next, earn credibility across the organization.

136
00:07:36,087 --> 00:07:40,254
Desire and have a passion to lead and manage people,

137
00:07:40,254 --> 00:07:43,087
that's real important in your job.

138
00:07:43,087 --> 00:07:45,087
Ability to build trust.

139
00:07:45,087 --> 00:07:49,178
Able to exemplify strong communication skills like we talked

140
00:07:49,178 --> 00:07:51,754
about earlier and demonstrate strategic,

141
00:07:51,754 --> 00:07:55,087
that is long term, planning skills.

142
00:07:55,087 --> 00:07:57,632
Also do you support process and metrics,

143
00:07:57,632 --> 00:08:02,087
in other words understanding the critical role of well

144
00:08:02,087 --> 00:08:05,087
defined processes within your organization.

145
00:08:05,087 --> 00:08:09,087
And have some basic project and team management skills.

146
00:08:09,087 --> 00:08:09,702
And lastly,

147
00:08:09,702 --> 00:08:12,472
marketing skills to kind of market the good things

148
00:08:12,472 --> 00:08:14,318
that your team does to others.

149
00:08:14,318 --> 00:08:17,087
So I would look for training opportunities to learn

150
00:08:17,087 --> 00:08:19,360
more about these leadership skills.

151
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,087
There are many books and articles,

152
00:08:22,087 --> 00:08:25,754
plus check out one of my other classes titled Leadership and

153
00:08:25,754 --> 00:08:29,087
Communication Skills for Software Engineers.

154
00:08:29,087 --> 00:08:32,087
Now let's focus on you for a moment.

155
00:08:32,087 --> 00:08:35,087
You need to build your skills as well.

156
00:08:35,087 --> 00:08:36,373
Since you have just come from a technical role,

157
00:08:36,373 --> 00:08:37,504
you know, based on our scenario,

158
00:08:37,504 --> 00:08:43,087
you will likely either need the following skills or need to improve them.

159
00:08:43,087 --> 00:08:47,087
One of them is going to be delegation.

160
00:08:47,087 --> 00:08:51,087
If you master the art of delegation, that is giving work to others,

161
00:08:51,087 --> 00:08:54,087
handing work off, you will also be building trust,

162
00:08:54,087 --> 00:08:59,087
big time, because they will say to themselves you trust me to do this?

163
00:08:59,087 --> 00:09:03,087
This instills trust back to you and a deeper sense of responsibility

164
00:09:03,087 --> 00:09:08,087
and motivation with the person you are delegating to.

165
00:09:08,087 --> 00:09:09,472
Leadership, of course, we talked about,

166
00:09:09,472 --> 00:09:12,587
but I just want to emphasize it for improving your

167
00:09:12,587 --> 00:09:14,087
management growth opportunities.

168
00:09:14,087 --> 00:09:18,087
Also communication, again we've already talked about communication.

169
00:09:18,087 --> 00:09:21,531
But I want to reemphasize it for improving your management growth opportunities.

170
00:09:21,531 --> 00:09:23,754
Leadership and communication are critical,

171
00:09:23,754 --> 00:09:27,587
you're going to be moving away from the technical side,

172
00:09:27,587 --> 00:09:30,087
so your skill gap, if you will,

173
00:09:30,087 --> 00:09:34,087
will be in the leadership and communication area and a big way to

174
00:09:34,087 --> 00:09:38,087
improve your productivity of your team and to grow yourself would be

175
00:09:38,087 --> 00:09:42,542
also to improve your ability to delegate.

176
00:09:42,542 --> 00:09:45,087
And lastly, succession planning.

177
00:09:45,087 --> 00:09:48,779
Who will take your role when you are out of the office,

178
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:51,856
sick, on vacation, yeah hopefully you can go on vacation,

179
00:09:51,856 --> 00:09:53,944
or actually get promoted and move on?

180
00:09:53,944 --> 00:09:58,373
I have seen many times in the corporate world that a person's promotion is

181
00:09:58,373 --> 00:10:03,087
held up because they do not have anyone to replace you.

182
00:10:03,087 --> 00:10:04,801
You want to put the processes in place,

183
00:10:04,801 --> 00:10:07,837
you want to do the things we've talked about in this course so

184
00:10:07,837 --> 00:10:09,837
far and the remaining portion of this course,

185
00:10:09,837 --> 00:10:13,814
so you can build a good and solid team that has a lot of good

186
00:10:13,814 --> 00:10:16,360
leadership and communication so at some point,

187
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:18,954
either for a short time, you're away on vacation,

188
00:10:18,954 --> 00:10:21,087
or you have other opportunities to move on.

189
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:25,373
These are very good practices you must work on to

190
00:10:25,373 --> 00:10:27,754
promote your own career as well.

191
00:10:27,754 --> 00:10:37,000
Alright now let's see how we build up our list of skill requirements and put together a plan in the next section.
