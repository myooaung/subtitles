00:00:00.544 --> 00:00:03.115
Whether you are using waterfall, Agile or a blend,

2
00:00:03.115 --> 00:00:06.726
and in fact most companies seem to be using a blend,

3
00:00:06.726 --> 00:00:08.544
these processes will still apply.

4
00:00:08.544 --> 00:00:13.794
Now in no way am I implying by the order that I have presented

5
00:00:13.794 --> 00:00:16.159
my processes that waterfall is the way to go.

6
00:00:16.159 --> 00:00:18.544
Use whatever methodology works for you and your team,

7
00:00:18.544 --> 00:00:19.544
but quite frankly,

8
00:00:19.544 --> 00:00:23.362
the order by which I presented is a more natural and

9
00:00:23.362 --> 00:00:25.544
organized approach to learn about them.

10
00:00:25.544 --> 00:00:30.544
Also, Agile used right is great, Agile used wrong is chaos.

11
00:00:30.544 --> 00:00:33.271
So you need to have process.

12
00:00:33.271 --> 00:00:35.544
Okay, let's summarize this module.

13
00:00:35.544 --> 00:00:37.627
Now let's recap this module.

14
00:00:37.627 --> 00:00:40.544
Alright, so what are your key processes?

15
00:00:40.544 --> 00:00:46.544
I have talked about 10 key processes, which ones will be yours?

16
00:00:46.544 --> 00:00:47.973
So determine your key processes,

17
00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:52.144
you may use some of the ones I presented or you may come up with

18
00:00:52.144 --> 00:00:54.544
some brand new ones I haven't even thought of.

19
00:00:54.544 --> 00:00:55.258
Alright good,

20
00:00:55.258 --> 00:01:01.322
so use these in this module as a start and evolve them as you need them.

21
00:01:01.322 --> 00:01:03.544
Add, remove or improve them.

22
00:01:03.544 --> 00:01:05.082
I highly recommend that.

23
00:01:05.082 --> 00:01:06.621
And when you do,

24
00:01:06.621 --> 00:01:10.852
be sure you document them and be sure you educate and train your team members

25
00:01:10.852 --> 00:01:14.817
to fully understand the process and the expected outcomes.

26
00:01:14.817 --> 00:01:17.544
And of course, continuously improve.

27
00:01:17.544 --> 00:01:20.544
Meet quarterly or monthly or whatever the cadence may be to continually

28
00:01:20.544 --> 00:01:25.544
review your processes and continue to make them better.

29
00:01:25.544 --> 00:01:25.901
Alright,

30
00:01:25.901 --> 00:01:31.698
in the next module we will wrap up and summarize the entire course and how far

31
00:01:31.698 --> 00:01:38.000
you've come to being a better and more prepared management. I'll see you there.
