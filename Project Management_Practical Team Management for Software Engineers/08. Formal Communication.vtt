00:00:00.882 --> 00:00:04.215
Now formal communication is more structured,

2
00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:05.326
more professional,

3
00:00:05.326 --> 00:00:10.882
and typically done in accordance with rules of a convention or etiquette.

4
00:00:10.882 --> 00:00:15.882
It is suitable for a professional or important situation or occasion.

5
00:00:15.882 --> 00:00:16.651
For example,

6
00:00:16.651 --> 00:00:22.282
contrast a simple 10 minute standup with a 1 hour presentation to your CEO.

7
00:00:22.282 --> 00:00:24.615
One is quick and informal,

8
00:00:24.615 --> 00:00:29.549
while the other is maybe very formal and structured to better ensure

9
00:00:29.549 --> 00:00:32.382
you get your message across and appear professional.

10
00:00:32.382 --> 00:00:36.882
I would suggest that the more senior the audience,

11
00:00:36.882 --> 00:00:40.215
the more attention you should spend ensuring you have a

12
00:00:40.215 --> 00:00:41.973
solid business oriented communication.

13
00:00:41.973 --> 00:00:42.518
Okay,

14
00:00:42.518 --> 00:00:47.973
now let's look at four methods of formal communication that

15
00:00:47.973 --> 00:00:52.882
you need in your new job as a manager.

16
00:00:52.882 --> 00:00:58.882
Here are my key formal communication methods that you can use every day.

17
00:00:58.882 --> 00:01:03.882
Presentations, and not just any old presentation, but effective presentations.

18
00:01:03.882 --> 00:01:09.267
Meetings, yes meetings can be boring, well maybe I can't solve that totally,

19
00:01:09.267 --> 00:01:14.326
but we will talk about how to have a meaningful and productive meeting.

20
00:01:14.326 --> 00:01:17.882
Emails, now these will be the formal emails.

21
00:01:17.882 --> 00:01:20.882
Now they maybe a thing of the past, but not for me.

22
00:01:20.882 --> 00:01:26.882
We will discuss just how to write a good business email.

23
00:01:26.882 --> 00:01:30.882
And lastly, status reporting, this is critical and so often overlooked,

24
00:01:30.882 --> 00:01:32.215
especially with your customers.

25
00:01:32.215 --> 00:01:41.000
Let's see how we can make useful status reports very easily. Okay, let's dive into each.
