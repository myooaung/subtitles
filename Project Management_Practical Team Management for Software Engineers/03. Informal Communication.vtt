Informal communication,

2
00:00:02.005 --> 00:00:06.974
what I mean by this is this type of communication is a relaxed,

3
00:00:06.974 --> 00:00:11.338
friendly and unofficial style or manner of communication.

4
00:00:11.338 --> 00:00:15.338
We're going to look at four methods of informal communication,

5
00:00:15.338 --> 00:00:19.338
this way you can start right away with having some tools to help you

6
00:00:19.338 --> 00:00:21.338
be a better communicator right out of the gate.

7
00:00:21.338 --> 00:00:25.338
Let's see what they are.

8
00:00:25.338 --> 00:00:28.005
Here are my key informal communication methods I

9
00:00:28.005 --> 00:00:30.588
want to talk about in this section.

10
00:00:30.588 --> 00:00:34.338
The first is conducting stand ups, face to face,

11
00:00:34.338 --> 00:00:36.421
quickie informal and short meetings.

12
00:00:36.421 --> 00:00:40.767
The next topic I will talk about is performing walk arounds,

13
00:00:40.767 --> 00:00:44.338
casual drop ins with you and your team and others.

14
00:00:44.338 --> 00:00:50.338
Next, casual emails, when and when not to use them.

15
00:00:50.338 --> 00:00:52.184
And lastly, daily interactions.

16
00:00:52.184 --> 00:01:01.000
What I am addressing here is how to act, behave, and carry yourself all day long.
