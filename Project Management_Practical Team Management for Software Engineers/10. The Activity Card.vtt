00:00:01.336 --> 00:00:04.336
Let's talk about what I call the activity card,

2
00:00:04.336 --> 00:00:09.936
and this is a really simple way to represent a chunk or unit of work.

3
00:00:09.936 --> 00:00:12.907
First the name, in this case it's Project,

4
00:00:12.907 --> 00:00:18.050
but it could be a project, an activity, a task or whatever makes sense for you.

5
00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:22.336
Next comes the start date, when should this activity start?

6
00:00:22.336 --> 00:00:24.479
This is our planned start date.

7
00:00:24.479 --> 00:00:28.736
Then in the lower left corner, the goal and the customer.

8
00:00:28.736 --> 00:00:33.869
So this chunk of work ties the goal or requirement 1.

9
00:00:33.869 --> 00:00:36.086
1, so we can thread it, that is,

10
00:00:36.086 --> 00:00:39.086
we know how it is aligned to the business at all times.

11
00:00:39.086 --> 00:00:41.836
I can look back at my notes of my requirements and

12
00:00:41.836 --> 00:00:43.765
tie it right back to the business.

13
00:00:43.765 --> 00:00:47.571
And so I know who the real business customer or owner is,

14
00:00:47.571 --> 00:00:50.042
I say /CEO, in this case.

15
00:00:50.042 --> 00:00:54.700
Oh boy, the CEO is driving this one, probably pretty important.

16
00:00:54.700 --> 00:00:58.336
Then upper right would be the end date.

17
00:00:58.336 --> 00:01:01.336
So I have my start date on the left, my end date on the right.

18
00:01:01.336 --> 00:01:04.336
These are the planned start and the planned end.

19
00:01:04.336 --> 00:01:08.398
And lastly I have budget, and in this case I'm saying 80 hours,

20
00:01:08.398 --> 00:01:11.881
but you could make it maybe more agile, like small,

21
00:01:11.881 --> 00:01:15.336
medium, large, or whatever makes sense for you.

22
00:01:15.336 --> 00:01:19.336
So be creative, adapt to your own needs,

23
00:01:19.336 --> 00:01:21.023
but I like this idea of an activity card,

24
00:01:21.023 --> 00:01:23.273
and you can make it any way you want to.

25
00:01:23.273 --> 00:01:27.336
You'll see on the next slide on how I use these activity cards,

26
00:01:27.336 --> 00:01:30.336
that might give you some other ideas or insights on how you may want to

27
00:01:30.336 --> 00:01:36.336
make mine better or evolve it to suite your needs.

28
00:01:36.336 --> 00:01:39.336
Now let's continue with the activity card model here,

29
00:01:39.336 --> 00:01:41.050
looking at the priority chart.

30
00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.622
So we have priorities 1 and 2 and our backlog,

31
00:01:44.622 --> 00:01:45.836
as we described before,

32
00:01:45.836 --> 00:01:48.567
and then we're going to list out our IT projects or

33
00:01:48.567 --> 00:01:49.490
activities with activity cards.

34
00:01:49.490 --> 00:01:52.336
But in this example I'm going to add color to my

35
00:01:52.336 --> 00:01:54.336
cards to give even more meaning.

36
00:01:54.336 --> 00:01:59.336
So on the left, if the card is green it'll be an on track project,

37
00:01:59.336 --> 00:02:04.669
yellow - a little behind, blue - ahead, great progress,

38
00:02:04.669 --> 00:02:08.936
red - we have issues, let's talk about those,

39
00:02:08.936 --> 00:02:11.336
and lastly gray - not started.

40
00:02:11.336 --> 00:02:15.622
So for an example in column 1 priority, Priority 1,

41
00:02:15.622 --> 00:02:17.972
I have three activities going.

42
00:02:17.972 --> 00:02:24.336
I have a project, an operational task and another project.

43
00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:27.395
So quickly to the eye I can see I have one on track,

44
00:02:27.395 --> 00:02:29.898
one a little behind, and one a little ahead,

45
00:02:29.898 --> 00:02:34.622
I can easily look at each one and see start date and end dates.

46
00:02:34.622 --> 00:02:39.336
I can easily see which requirement or goal it ties to,

47
00:02:39.336 --> 00:02:43.193
like the engineering one on the bottom, Project 1.

48
00:02:43.193 --> 00:02:43.622
1.

49
00:02:43.622 --> 00:02:45.336
2, the blue one.

50
00:02:45.336 --> 00:02:47.490
It's tied to a business driver, 2.

51
00:02:47.490 --> 00:02:52.413
3 and it belongs to engineering, and it's a budget of around 120 hours.

52
00:02:52.413 --> 00:02:56.586
So it's very, very simple to look at this and see what's going on.

53
00:02:56.586 --> 00:02:57.086
In fact,

54
00:02:57.086 --> 00:03:01.028
not only is it easy for executives to look at or other

55
00:03:01.028 --> 00:03:03.622
steering group or people of business origin,

56
00:03:03.622 --> 00:03:08.136
it's also very easy for your team to see what's important and what to work on.

57
00:03:08.136 --> 00:03:11.571
I can come in the morning and look at that and go hey,

58
00:03:11.571 --> 00:03:16.259
this is what I may need to do, or you can use this as a tool for a daily standup,

59
00:03:16.259 --> 00:03:18.336
to realign your team each morning to make sure

60
00:03:18.336 --> 00:03:21.336
they're working on the right thing.

61
00:03:21.336 --> 00:03:24.836
Now Priority 2 I have Activity 2.

62
00:03:24.836 --> 00:03:26.273
3 and Project 1.

63
00:03:26.273 --> 00:03:26.586
1.

64
00:03:26.586 --> 00:03:26.898
3.

65
00:03:26.898 --> 00:03:31.407
Now how I work with my team is everyone's working on priority 1 items,

66
00:03:31.407 --> 00:03:36.218
but there'll be times when I'm waiting for a phone call or I have a really

67
00:03:36.218 --> 00:03:38.869
bad bug and I need to talk with someone to help me fix it,

68
00:03:38.869 --> 00:03:43.721
I'm going to maybe drop to priority 2 to start working on some of those until

69
00:03:43.721 --> 00:03:48.336
the road blocks are complete to continue with priority 1.

70
00:03:48.336 --> 00:03:50.736
Now in the backlog I have, at this time,

71
00:03:50.736 --> 00:03:54.259
one project, project, I'm going to call it just Project 3.

72
00:03:54.259 --> 00:03:57.336
And each morning we'll look at priority 1,

73
00:03:57.336 --> 00:04:00.003
priority 2, see how our progress is going,

74
00:04:00.003 --> 00:04:02.336
what we're working on, how is it,

75
00:04:02.336 --> 00:04:06.907
and maybe a priority 2 project moves into the backlog because the customer says

76
00:04:06.907 --> 00:04:10.336
hey not as important as project 3 and we move that forward.

77
00:04:10.336 --> 00:04:13.536
So every day I like to look at the projects and activities,

78
00:04:13.536 --> 00:04:17.609
where are we and what are we working on?

79
00:04:17.609 --> 00:04:20.336
This is very, very simple.

80
00:04:20.336 --> 00:04:24.336
Now remember what executives just don't want to see?

81
00:04:24.336 --> 00:04:25.536
It was this.

82
00:04:25.536 --> 00:04:28.336
So would you rather look at this?

83
00:04:28.336 --> 00:04:30.669
Or would you rather look at this?

84
00:04:30.669 --> 00:04:34.427
So the point, again, is to make something easy to understand,

85
00:04:34.427 --> 00:04:36.245
not only to your team,

86
00:04:36.245 --> 00:04:40.193
but more importantly to the business leaders of the company so it's very

87
00:04:40.193 --> 00:04:44.193
easy to see what you're doing and how you're tying your work to the

88
00:04:44.193 --> 00:04:56.000
business and how you set up your priorities. This is so key and fundamental to your new job as a manager of IT.
