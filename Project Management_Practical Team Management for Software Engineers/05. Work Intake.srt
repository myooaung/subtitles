1
00:00:01,281 --> 00:00:04,281
In this section we will discuss your work intake process.

2
00:00:04,281 --> 00:00:07,031
I like to see it as a funnel in a way,

3
00:00:07,031 --> 00:00:11,204
at the top of the funnel all work intake may be a bit fuzzy.

4
00:00:11,204 --> 00:00:13,896
Is it a user request, some requirements,

5
00:00:13,896 --> 00:00:16,190
maybe it's a ticket, it's an operational issues,

6
00:00:16,190 --> 00:00:17,281
is it a project.

7
00:00:17,281 --> 00:00:22,281
And as it moves down the funnel it'll become more understood and actionable.

8
00:00:22,281 --> 00:00:26,281
Okay, let's jump in.

9
00:00:26,281 --> 00:00:29,881
The work intake process is the activity of collecting,

10
00:00:29,881 --> 00:00:33,781
organizing, tracking and prioritizing work for your team,

11
00:00:33,781 --> 00:00:37,481
also known as, AKA, your portfolio of work.

12
00:00:37,481 --> 00:00:42,645
At any time you need to be able to show and share this

13
00:00:42,645 --> 00:00:45,917
information with your team so they can easily see

14
00:00:45,917 --> 00:00:48,948
everything on your collective plates, both your in work,

15
00:00:48,948 --> 00:00:52,364
you know, what you're working on, and backlog activities,

16
00:00:52,364 --> 00:00:56,218
what's in your backlog, what you may work on in the future.

17
00:00:56,218 --> 00:00:59,881
You need to be able to show and share with your manager so he and she can

18
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:03,218
see what is on your plate and the status of each item.

19
00:01:03,218 --> 00:01:03,843
And lastly,

20
00:01:03,843 --> 00:01:08,435
you need to be able to show and share the portion of the portfolio

21
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:12,281
that belongs or is owned by each of your customers.

22
00:01:12,281 --> 00:01:15,050
You typically only show those items that the customer

23
00:01:15,050 --> 00:01:17,666
has provided to you to each customer.

24
00:01:17,666 --> 00:01:22,281
Work intake, the management of work as it comes in,

25
00:01:22,281 --> 00:01:25,190
is extremely important because it'll drive all the

26
00:01:25,190 --> 00:01:28,148
activities that you should do, when you should do them,

27
00:01:28,148 --> 00:01:29,481
who you do them for,

28
00:01:29,481 --> 00:01:33,973
and you need to be able to provide crystal clear transparency

29
00:01:33,973 --> 00:01:37,081
and clarity to all potential stakeholders,

30
00:01:37,081 --> 00:01:41,881
your manager, your employees, your team,

31
00:01:41,881 --> 00:01:44,281
and your customers.

32
00:01:44,281 --> 00:01:47,031
If you do not have a handle, that is a process,

33
00:01:47,031 --> 00:01:50,099
to manage your work intake, I suggest to you,

34
00:01:50,099 --> 00:01:53,281
strongly, that you will not be successful.

35
00:01:53,281 --> 00:01:56,050
You will not deliver priority items and your team will be in

36
00:01:56,050 --> 00:01:58,567
chaos and feel insecure about what they work on,

37
00:01:58,567 --> 00:02:01,204
and if it has any value to the business.

38
00:02:01,204 --> 00:02:01,512
Remember,

39
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:05,614
people like to work on things that have value and that they can contribute.

40
00:02:05,614 --> 00:02:08,896
But let me also say, the work may come into your team,

41
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,050
may in fact be a bit chaotic.

42
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:12,281
That's normal in business.

43
00:02:12,281 --> 00:02:16,281
So what you'll want to do is get ahead of this and manage it.

44
00:02:16,281 --> 00:02:20,281
So requests can come in in many methods, certainly there's verbal.

45
00:02:20,281 --> 00:02:21,348
Face to face encounter,

46
00:02:21,348 --> 00:02:25,281
such as in a meeting or even in a hallway discussion or your boss just

47
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:28,281
coming into your office saying hey I need you to do this.

48
00:02:28,281 --> 00:02:31,666
Another way is the phone, it's just another form of verbal,

49
00:02:31,666 --> 00:02:34,781
but for completeness I have added it here.

50
00:02:34,781 --> 00:02:37,281
Both of these examples are unstructured,

51
00:02:37,281 --> 00:02:43,281
soft, and typically poorly understood forms of telling you what to work on.

52
00:02:43,281 --> 00:02:44,781
So return to your desk or computer,

53
00:02:44,781 --> 00:02:48,127
write down what you think you understand the work to mean,

54
00:02:48,127 --> 00:02:53,645
send an email back to the requestor for validation before you begin any work.

55
00:02:53,645 --> 00:02:57,099
The English language, or any language, is packed full of ambiguities.

56
00:02:57,099 --> 00:03:00,114
Another way you might get requests is email.

57
00:03:00,114 --> 00:03:04,281
This is a very common way to receive a request.

58
00:03:04,281 --> 00:03:07,424
It is written, which is a great start, may have attachments,

59
00:03:07,424 --> 00:03:08,645
which is good, screenshots,

60
00:03:08,645 --> 00:03:11,917
images or other artifacts which can really help you

61
00:03:11,917 --> 00:03:13,781
better understand the requirement.

62
00:03:13,781 --> 00:03:17,710
But emails are notoriously poor for tracking and

63
00:03:17,710 --> 00:03:20,281
managing anything but your junk mail.

64
00:03:20,281 --> 00:03:22,567
Tickets, even a better way, I like this.

65
00:03:22,567 --> 00:03:26,781
The data collected in a ticket is very structured and you can

66
00:03:26,781 --> 00:03:29,281
easily decide on the structure yourself,

67
00:03:29,281 --> 00:03:30,736
and it's automatically tracked.

68
00:03:30,736 --> 00:03:34,881
There are many ticketing systems out there and if you don't use one,

69
00:03:34,881 --> 00:03:38,031
please consider using one as a way to manage and track

70
00:03:38,031 --> 00:03:40,281
your work requests that come in.

71
00:03:40,281 --> 00:03:43,614
And lastly, it may be some sort of request form,

72
00:03:43,614 --> 00:03:44,614
which is fine,

73
00:03:44,614 --> 00:03:49,281
like a project request form or requirement request form or some other form of,

74
00:03:49,281 --> 00:03:50,050
well, form.

75
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:54,281
It may be electronic form as well, and hopefully it is.

76
00:03:54,281 --> 00:03:58,281
So that's another way to handle work as it comes in.

77
00:03:58,281 --> 00:04:02,281
Okay, now that that's happened, the process begins.

78
00:04:02,281 --> 00:04:05,281
So let's take a look at it.

79
00:04:05,281 --> 00:04:06,372
Organizing work intake.

80
00:04:06,372 --> 00:04:09,281
Work gets started for a variety of reasons,

81
00:04:09,281 --> 00:04:14,281
but good intentions are usually not enough to justify each activity.

82
00:04:14,281 --> 00:04:16,948
In spite of defining or enforcing intake criteria,

83
00:04:16,948 --> 00:04:18,645
work continues to be launched,

84
00:04:18,645 --> 00:04:22,281
which should never have been approved in the first place.

85
00:04:22,281 --> 00:04:26,512
So you must manage and organize all work requests and a

86
00:04:26,512 --> 00:04:30,781
manage process starts with tracking, more on that later.

87
00:04:30,781 --> 00:04:31,281
Why?

88
00:04:31,281 --> 00:04:36,281
You need 100% visibility of all potential work.

89
00:04:36,281 --> 00:04:37,512
This is very important.

90
00:04:37,512 --> 00:04:40,881
If your manager thinks you're not doing very much, is that good?

91
00:04:40,881 --> 00:04:44,372
If you manager thinks you're doing a ton of stuff and you have a huge backlog,

92
00:04:44,372 --> 00:04:46,281
that's great, you might get more people.

93
00:04:46,281 --> 00:04:48,281
You might be able to hire more, you might get more tools.

94
00:04:48,281 --> 00:04:48,896
That's good.

95
00:04:48,896 --> 00:04:54,281
Next, you need to know where your work is coming from, what are your sources.

96
00:04:54,281 --> 00:04:59,281
Next, you need to know the status of your work.

97
00:04:59,281 --> 00:05:03,281
At any time someone should be able to say, what's the status of this project?

98
00:05:03,281 --> 00:05:04,781
What's the status of this bug?

99
00:05:04,781 --> 00:05:06,281
What's the status of this activity?

100
00:05:06,281 --> 00:05:10,127
At all times, so you can respond to your customer,

101
00:05:10,127 --> 00:05:15,281
you can respond to your coworkers and you can respond to your manager as well.

102
00:05:15,281 --> 00:05:17,127
So you need a transparent portfolio.

103
00:05:17,127 --> 00:05:22,281
I use the term portfolio as the collection of all your work intake activities.

104
00:05:22,281 --> 00:05:26,448
You need to easily convey your portfolio to management or,

105
00:05:26,448 --> 00:05:28,081
in fact, senior management.

106
00:05:28,081 --> 00:05:30,081
Okay, there are many benefits,

107
00:05:30,081 --> 00:05:33,463
your development team will have complete access to all this information,

108
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:36,819
which is great, you can look at the portfolio to help you make decisions,

109
00:05:36,819 --> 00:05:41,281
make options, start projects, stop projects or activities.

110
00:05:41,281 --> 00:05:43,743
And visibility for all, I keep stressing that,

111
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:48,281
this is very, very important so that everyone can see the entire work intake,

112
00:05:48,281 --> 00:05:50,645
all the activities, either in work or backlogged.

113
00:05:50,645 --> 00:05:51,190
And lastly,

114
00:05:51,190 --> 00:05:54,589
just the whole benefit of having everything in one spot

115
00:05:54,589 --> 00:05:57,281
is then you can do backlog management.

116
00:05:57,281 --> 00:05:58,681
You can look at all your items,

117
00:05:58,681 --> 00:06:01,781
you can groom those items and see what you need to work on,

118
00:06:01,781 --> 00:06:03,281
what should wait, et cetera.

119
00:06:03,281 --> 00:06:08,281
All potential work and work in progress gets logged and tracked.

120
00:06:08,281 --> 00:06:12,781
Let me say it again, all work, no exceptions,

121
00:06:12,781 --> 00:06:15,281
don't let anything slip by,

122
00:06:15,281 --> 00:06:19,948
get everything in that portfolio so that your management and customers can have

123
00:06:19,948 --> 00:06:23,281
the full benefit to all the activities you're working on.

124
00:06:23,281 --> 00:06:25,424
And this is very important for your team to feel

125
00:06:25,424 --> 00:06:28,067
good about what they're working on, to reduce chaos,

126
00:06:28,067 --> 00:06:32,138
for the customers to believe that what you have is what you're

127
00:06:32,138 --> 00:06:34,710
working on and you really do have a backlog,

128
00:06:34,710 --> 00:06:37,031
you're not just saying to them, hey I'm busy,

129
00:06:37,031 --> 00:06:38,281
don't give me anything else.

130
00:06:38,281 --> 00:06:38,495
No,

131
00:06:38,495 --> 00:06:40,852
you can show them and you can demonstrate to them that

132
00:06:40,852 --> 00:06:43,358
you have 28 items in the backlog, help me prioritize these,

133
00:06:43,358 --> 00:06:45,917
help me go to management with the higher board developers,

134
00:06:45,917 --> 00:06:48,114
help me make this happen for you.

135
00:06:48,114 --> 00:06:49,364
Very, very important.

136
00:06:49,364 --> 00:06:52,852
Of all these sections, in this particular area here,

137
00:06:52,852 --> 00:06:55,138
the 10 sections I'm going to talk about,

138
00:06:55,138 --> 00:07:00,281
this one I think is number 1.

139
00:07:00,281 --> 00:07:02,281
So what information should you track in your portfolio?

140
00:07:02,281 --> 00:07:07,435
You need to track and prioritize and release or authorize your work and

141
00:07:07,435 --> 00:07:09,281
you're going to use your portfolio as a way to do that.

142
00:07:09,281 --> 00:07:13,031
So here is a sample portfolio schema or template,

143
00:07:13,031 --> 00:07:17,281
in other words here are the columns or fields you should have.

144
00:07:17,281 --> 00:07:21,281
Now please feel free to add, subtract, or change anything that works for you,

145
00:07:21,281 --> 00:07:25,281
but here's just a starter, because you're going to need to meet once a week,

146
00:07:25,281 --> 00:07:29,435
maybe twice a week, to look at your portfolio,

147
00:07:29,435 --> 00:07:32,512
to review, scrub, groom, all your work intake,

148
00:07:32,512 --> 00:07:35,281
to make sure what you're doing is on track,

149
00:07:35,281 --> 00:07:36,281
maybe there are blockers,

150
00:07:36,281 --> 00:07:38,781
maybe there are things you have to do or activities

151
00:07:38,781 --> 00:07:40,281
in order to move things forward.

152
00:07:40,281 --> 00:07:41,614
Okay, let's get started.

153
00:07:41,614 --> 00:07:46,204
An ID, I like to have some sort of unique ID for a reference,

154
00:07:46,204 --> 00:07:49,281
sometimes they're auto generated by the system you may use,

155
00:07:49,281 --> 00:07:50,973
and again, you may use a spreadsheet, you may use SharePoint,

156
00:07:50,973 --> 00:07:55,948
you may use Jera, millions of tracking tools out there,

157
00:07:55,948 --> 00:07:58,281
find one, use it.

158
00:07:58,281 --> 00:07:59,906
Who's the leader of this or the owner, the name of the item,

159
00:07:59,906 --> 00:08:03,281
some sort of short description so you know what the heck the item is.

160
00:08:03,281 --> 00:08:08,281
LOE, level of effort, come up with what you think is the right criteria,

161
00:08:08,281 --> 00:08:13,481
maybe small is less than 24 hours, maybe medium is 24 to 48,

162
00:08:13,481 --> 00:08:17,094
maybe large is over 48 and extra large is over 100.

163
00:08:17,094 --> 00:08:20,531
Or maybe you can use more of an Agile scrum where you

164
00:08:20,531 --> 00:08:23,081
have different kinds of chunks of work, just small,

165
00:08:23,081 --> 00:08:26,281
medium, large, and big or something like that.

166
00:08:26,281 --> 00:08:28,503
Whatever works, but be consistent.

167
00:08:28,503 --> 00:08:30,281
What's the start date?

168
00:08:30,281 --> 00:08:31,948
When should this thing begin?

169
00:08:31,948 --> 00:08:33,281
What's the due date?

170
00:08:33,281 --> 00:08:36,281
When does the customer request it to be complete?

171
00:08:36,281 --> 00:08:40,281
And if it has started, what's the percent complete?

172
00:08:40,281 --> 00:08:42,281
Then you'll want to have next week's deliverables,

173
00:08:42,281 --> 00:08:44,995
so another little column, might be a little wider if you will,

174
00:08:44,995 --> 00:08:48,281
in other words, once this task or activity has been worked forward,

175
00:08:48,281 --> 00:08:52,435
you'll want to know what's going to be delivered in the next week.

176
00:08:52,435 --> 00:08:56,614
Alright, then you'll want to have another column for a blocker or issues,

177
00:08:56,614 --> 00:08:59,008
in other words, this item is stuck.

178
00:08:59,008 --> 00:09:00,099
What's the blocker,

179
00:09:00,099 --> 00:09:03,781
what's the thing blocking it from moving forward or the issue,

180
00:09:03,781 --> 00:09:05,281
that's also very, very important.

181
00:09:05,281 --> 00:09:07,281
And there may be more than one, and then you'll want to talk about that,

182
00:09:07,281 --> 00:09:11,281
remove the blocker so it can move forward.

183
00:09:11,281 --> 00:09:12,512
And then there's risk.

184
00:09:12,512 --> 00:09:16,710
What could happen downstream if you don't do this or you're working on it?

185
00:09:16,710 --> 00:09:20,281
Maybe itemize the risk or risks that could affect this item.

186
00:09:20,281 --> 00:09:24,281
And then what's the team priority for this?

187
00:09:24,281 --> 00:09:24,987
In other words,

188
00:09:24,987 --> 00:09:28,281
how I like to do this is as a manager I'd like to put

189
00:09:28,281 --> 00:09:30,681
down my priorities for the team, in other words,

190
00:09:30,681 --> 00:09:33,710
I might pick the top 3 that are important to me,

191
00:09:33,710 --> 00:09:37,281
so people know when they come up for air or are free,

192
00:09:37,281 --> 00:09:42,031
they choose one of these first before choosing maybe the other priorities.

193
00:09:42,031 --> 00:09:43,781
Sponsor or contact,

194
00:09:43,781 --> 00:09:49,281
really who is the person that gave you this task or the

195
00:09:49,281 --> 00:09:52,281
customer area or a sponsor or things like that,

196
00:09:52,281 --> 00:09:53,710
maybe their phone number and email so we know who

197
00:09:53,710 --> 00:09:55,481
to go back to and ask questions.

198
00:09:55,481 --> 00:09:58,281
And then status, just what's the status.

199
00:09:58,281 --> 00:10:01,495
And you can come up with anything you want,

200
00:10:01,495 --> 00:10:04,348
it could be backlog, active, you know, on hold,

201
00:10:04,348 --> 00:10:07,281
come up with a variety of status types if you'd like.

202
00:10:07,281 --> 00:10:11,781
Now this is just a short list and you could have a lot more columns as well,

203
00:10:11,781 --> 00:10:14,031
make sure they're meaningful to you and your team,

204
00:10:14,031 --> 00:10:17,281
capture the right information, all very important.

205
00:10:17,281 --> 00:10:24,281
And this could be the start of all the work you're going to do in your team.

206
00:10:24,281 --> 00:10:28,281
Now let's summarize the work intake process.

207
00:10:28,281 --> 00:10:29,424
You want to collect,

208
00:10:29,424 --> 00:10:33,138
organize and track all work intake items so as they come in

209
00:10:33,138 --> 00:10:36,567
from any of those sources we talked about,

210
00:10:36,567 --> 00:10:38,281
you immediately log them.

211
00:10:38,281 --> 00:10:41,281
For each item, fill out as many of the columns of data as you can,

212
00:10:41,281 --> 00:10:44,281
and we talked about that with the portfolio schema,

213
00:10:44,281 --> 00:10:44,948
and again,

214
00:10:44,948 --> 00:10:47,781
change the columns of information any way you want to reflect

215
00:10:47,781 --> 00:10:50,099
an accurate representation of your world.

216
00:10:50,099 --> 00:10:53,948
You'll want to meet regularly to scrub your portfolio,

217
00:10:53,948 --> 00:10:57,281
I'd say at least once a week, maybe even twice.

218
00:10:57,281 --> 00:11:01,969
And what I mean by scrub is to review line by line each item and

219
00:11:01,969 --> 00:11:05,050
discuss it's status whether it is still in the backlog,

220
00:11:05,050 --> 00:11:07,567
not being worked yet, or it's been released for work,

221
00:11:07,567 --> 00:11:08,852
and again, maybe twice a week,

222
00:11:08,852 --> 00:11:13,281
figure out what your cadence is and what works for you and your team.

223
00:11:13,281 --> 00:11:17,645
And lastly, provide total visibility to your manager,

224
00:11:17,645 --> 00:11:22,495
to your team, and to your customer, so anyone can easily click,

225
00:11:22,495 --> 00:11:26,424
if you will, and see what it is you're working on.

226
00:11:26,424 --> 00:11:29,281
Maybe it is a list structure in SharePoint,

227
00:11:29,281 --> 00:11:31,099
a spreadsheet, a ticketing system,

228
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:34,781
use anything that will allow concurrent usage and easy access.

229
00:11:34,781 --> 00:11:40,881
Okay, so how do you know what to do for an item or an activity in your portfolio?

230
00:11:40,881 --> 00:11:42,748
You will need to do some thinking,

231
00:11:42,748 --> 00:11:46,008
I guess or requirements analysis before you can,

232
00:11:46,008 --> 00:11:54,000
in my opinion, do anything at all. So let's talk about requirements analysis next.
