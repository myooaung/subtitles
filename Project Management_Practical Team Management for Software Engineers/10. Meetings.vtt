1
00:00:00.287 --> 00:00:01.518
Well, what's a meeting?

2
00:00:01.518 --> 00:00:03.979
Well you might be scoffing at me now,

3
00:00:03.979 --> 00:00:06.405
thinking that of course you know what a meeting is.

4
00:00:06.405 --> 00:00:10.749
I might go out on a limb here, but I think maybe you might not know,

5
00:00:10.749 --> 00:00:14.133
especially what I'm calling a formal and successful meeting.

6
00:00:14.133 --> 00:00:18.287
As a consultant I have been in many companies,

7
00:00:18.287 --> 00:00:20.979
meeting many people and attending their meetings,

8
00:00:20.979 --> 00:00:24.716
it is rare that I see a meeting conducted well.

9
00:00:24.716 --> 00:00:30.162
So that's what I mean by what's a meeting here, and let's talk about it.

10
00:00:30.162 --> 00:00:31.287
Okay the purpose.

11
00:00:31.287 --> 00:00:35.287
Well the purpose of a meeting is to get something done, right.

12
00:00:35.287 --> 00:00:38.287
Why have it unless you want to get something done.

13
00:00:38.287 --> 00:00:41.754
And the fact that we will be with other people means that you

14
00:00:41.754 --> 00:00:43.672
need them in order to get something done.

15
00:00:43.672 --> 00:00:46.887
You're not inviting them there just for the heck of it.

16
00:00:46.887 --> 00:00:49.287
Now let's talk about some benefits.

17
00:00:49.287 --> 00:00:54.287
For me getting decisions made and commitments made for further actions

18
00:00:54.287 --> 00:01:00.287
identified and assigned is the most critical in a work environment.

19
00:01:00.287 --> 00:01:00.787
Alignment.

20
00:01:00.787 --> 00:01:04.787
Rather than spending excessive time reading through email

21
00:01:04.787 --> 00:01:06.887
chains and clarifying their meetings,

22
00:01:06.887 --> 00:01:12.014
meetings are often the most effective means to ensure alignment of people,

23
00:01:12.014 --> 00:01:15.176
alignment of thought and alignment of action,

24
00:01:15.176 --> 00:01:18.287
basically getting everyone on the same page.

25
00:01:18.287 --> 00:01:21.749
So I like getting people together and really making

26
00:01:21.749 --> 00:01:24.378
sure we're on track to move forward.

27
00:01:24.378 --> 00:01:27.832
Miscommunication, whether it's in IT or any business environment,

28
00:01:27.832 --> 00:01:33.287
is probably a real death nail on so many projects.

29
00:01:33.287 --> 00:01:34.014
Okay, brainstorming.

30
00:01:34.014 --> 00:01:38.378
When a solution is not readily available or you need innovative concepts,

31
00:01:38.378 --> 00:01:42.087
a brainstorming meeting may just be what the doctor order,

32
00:01:42.087 --> 00:01:45.287
so I like meetings for brainstorming as well.

33
00:01:45.287 --> 00:01:48.287
And lastly sometimes it's just plain education.

34
00:01:48.287 --> 00:01:50.620
When the education of individuals is necessary,

35
00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.087
meetings are often the best solution for that.

36
00:01:53.087 --> 00:01:55.754
This is not the same as a class per say,

37
00:01:55.754 --> 00:01:56.595
but more targeted,

38
00:01:56.595 --> 00:01:59.672
such as when educating a group on changes in the

39
00:01:59.672 --> 00:02:02.001
business goals and how it will affect them.

40
00:02:02.001 --> 00:02:05.287
And again, that's the purpose and the outcome of the meeting.

41
00:02:05.287 --> 00:02:08.954
Now let's look at what you might need to hold an

42
00:02:08.954 --> 00:02:13.287
effective and productive meeting.

43
00:02:13.287 --> 00:02:15.595
Now there are many forums which you will be leading

44
00:02:15.595 --> 00:02:17.651
meetings and let's discuss them briefly.

45
00:02:17.651 --> 00:02:22.210
Now they'll be team meetings, so you'll have many team meetings with,

46
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:22.902
well your team.

47
00:02:22.902 --> 00:02:26.287
And they may be staff meetings or special meetings or

48
00:02:26.287 --> 00:02:29.287
requirements meetings and things like that.

49
00:02:29.287 --> 00:02:30.287
You will also have meetings with your management.

50
00:02:30.287 --> 00:02:31.923
You'll have meetings with your boss,

51
00:02:31.923 --> 00:02:34.954
maybe with your boss's boss or other senior management.

52
00:02:34.954 --> 00:02:38.287
You will also have meetings with your customers.

53
00:02:38.287 --> 00:02:41.287
Maybe with the end users of the systems you provide or maybe product owners

54
00:02:41.287 --> 00:02:45.287
in a scrum model or the management of those entities.

55
00:02:45.287 --> 00:02:47.687
Many of these meetings may be requirements gathering,

56
00:02:47.687 --> 00:02:52.176
preparing for a pilot implementation, going over system defects,

57
00:02:52.176 --> 00:02:54.573
project planning, and training to name a few.

58
00:02:54.573 --> 00:02:57.787
You may have meetings also with your suppliers or external companies

59
00:02:57.787 --> 00:03:02.537
or maybe internal departments that provide you products or services

60
00:03:02.537 --> 00:03:06.287
to help you and your team get jobs done.

61
00:03:06.287 --> 00:03:09.287
Also another meeting forum will be interviewing for new hires.

62
00:03:09.287 --> 00:03:10.923
As we discussed in another module,

63
00:03:10.923 --> 00:03:15.620
you'll be having meetings with potential new hires to add to your team.

64
00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:16.037
Also,

65
00:03:16.037 --> 00:03:22.287
individual meetings with your team in terms of conducting performance reviews.

66
00:03:22.287 --> 00:03:25.287
You'll be meeting with each person one or more times a year and spending

67
00:03:25.287 --> 00:03:30.287
quality time with them about their performance and careers.

68
00:03:30.287 --> 00:03:32.954
Now what do all these have in common?

69
00:03:32.954 --> 00:03:36.196
For each you will need to plan the meeting,

70
00:03:36.196 --> 00:03:41.378
lead the meeting, and perform the follow up activities of the meeting.

71
00:03:41.378 --> 00:03:44.287
So let's talk about those requirements and responsibilities

72
00:03:44.287 --> 00:03:47.954
you will have in each and every forum you'll have in

73
00:03:47.954 --> 00:03:51.287
conducting your business as a manager.

74
00:03:51.287 --> 00:03:55.287
Now for every meeting, I believe, you must plan the following.

75
00:03:55.287 --> 00:03:57.742
Of course there's always going to be the purpose,

76
00:03:57.742 --> 00:04:01.287
clearly identify the purpose of the meeting and the outcome wanted.

77
00:04:01.287 --> 00:04:05.216
Agenda, list all the agenda items and for every agenda item,

78
00:04:05.216 --> 00:04:08.954
who do you think will speak on that item and maybe about how

79
00:04:08.954 --> 00:04:10.954
much time each agenda item might take,

80
00:04:10.954 --> 00:04:13.954
so remember we're going to have a time fence,

81
00:04:13.954 --> 00:04:16.154
typically meetings are about an hour or so.

82
00:04:16.154 --> 00:04:18.287
Attendees, who do you want to be there?

83
00:04:18.287 --> 00:04:19.651
Don't over invite.

84
00:04:19.651 --> 00:04:24.001
That's wasteful of time and sometimes gets unruly, keep it to a minimum.

85
00:04:24.001 --> 00:04:27.001
Of course you're always going to pick a date and a time that makes sense

86
00:04:27.001 --> 00:04:30.056
so you can maximize the attendees that you need there.

87
00:04:30.056 --> 00:04:35.001
You're going to send out a meeting request and use Outlook and Exchange,

88
00:04:35.001 --> 00:04:37.501
whatever tool you use, use that tool,

89
00:04:37.501 --> 00:04:41.742
but make it real clear and you can also include the agenda or other

90
00:04:41.742 --> 00:04:43.537
pertinent information along with the meeting request.

91
00:04:43.537 --> 00:04:45.858
And of course, meeting requests will also have locations,

92
00:04:45.858 --> 00:04:47.858
but think about it ahead of time,

93
00:04:47.858 --> 00:04:52.287
is this going to be a physical meeting or virtual or maybe a little of both.

94
00:04:52.287 --> 00:04:57.287
Remember, some meetings make more sense to be physically together,

95
00:04:57.287 --> 00:05:00.014
sometimes that face to face is much more productive and

96
00:05:00.014 --> 00:05:03.364
sometimes virtual is just fine or a combination of.

97
00:05:03.364 --> 00:05:12.287
Alright now let's look at your leadership responsibilities for formal meetings.

98
00:05:12.287 --> 00:05:14.430
Also I'd like to call your attention to the demo.

99
00:05:14.430 --> 00:05:16.144
zip file that comes with this module.

100
00:05:16.144 --> 00:05:19.287
I have a sample template in there for a meeting agenda,

101
00:05:19.287 --> 00:05:20.787
so it gives you a good start,

102
00:05:20.787 --> 00:05:23.441
you're welcome to change it any way you want to that makes

103
00:05:23.441 --> 00:05:24.825
sense for you and your organization,

104
00:05:24.825 --> 00:05:28.056
but it should help out right away to kind of jumpstart

105
00:05:28.056 --> 00:05:33.287
what a good agenda should contain.

106
00:05:33.287 --> 00:05:38.287
Now for every meeting you must perform these leadership duties,

107
00:05:38.287 --> 00:05:41.287
step your way through the agenda, take notes.

108
00:05:41.287 --> 00:05:43.787
You will take notes period.

109
00:05:43.787 --> 00:05:49.787
Use pencil, paper, pad, or your laptop, you must take really good notes.

110
00:05:49.787 --> 00:05:53.412
Document action items for each topic on the agenda,

111
00:05:53.412 --> 00:05:58.287
who's responsible for it, what they need to do and the due date,

112
00:05:58.287 --> 00:06:03.287
and document all agreements and all decisions made with their rationale.

113
00:06:03.287 --> 00:06:06.111
A lot of times people say, yeah I agree to do that,

114
00:06:06.111 --> 00:06:08.014
but why was the reason for that?

115
00:06:08.014 --> 00:06:11.287
Or why was the reason for not doing something?

116
00:06:11.287 --> 00:06:13.537
It's important to have a little sentence that says,

117
00:06:13.537 --> 00:06:15.287
here's the rationale that we discussed.

118
00:06:15.287 --> 00:06:19.358
Document all issues, you know, what are the issues facing the team?

119
00:06:19.358 --> 00:06:23.287
Some will get assigned as action items and some may be

120
00:06:23.287 --> 00:06:25.287
on the list for the next meeting.

121
00:06:25.287 --> 00:06:28.120
As a leader you want to promote active discussions,

122
00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:32.287
don't tell people what to do, ask for their inputs.

123
00:06:32.287 --> 00:06:36.573
You may already have an idea, don't just dump it out there,

124
00:06:36.573 --> 00:06:41.287
let's wait, be patient for what others are going to add and contribute.

125
00:06:41.287 --> 00:06:44.287
You don't want to say, Lauren, any questions?

126
00:06:44.287 --> 00:06:45.716
Well that doesn't work.

127
00:06:45.716 --> 00:06:50.599
Some people may be on the quiet or shy side, and may have a lot to contribute.

128
00:06:50.599 --> 00:06:52.287
So be a leader and ask questions, such as,

129
00:06:52.287 --> 00:06:57.287
Lauren, do you have any inputs on the new database design?

130
00:06:57.287 --> 00:07:01.037
Or Lauren, you mentioned earlier about a potential issue,

131
00:07:01.037 --> 00:07:06.287
do you think based on the new database design that the issue is resolved?

132
00:07:06.287 --> 00:07:07.537
Thinks like that.

133
00:07:07.537 --> 00:07:09.620
So nice questions, friendly questions,

134
00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:13.787
and easy for them to answer and be engaged.

135
00:07:13.787 --> 00:07:20.787
Also you want to be inclusive to all attendees, that is, don't overlook anyone.

136
00:07:20.787 --> 00:07:24.287
Remember you invited them for a reason.

137
00:07:24.287 --> 00:07:28.912
You need something from them for a successful outcome, don't overlook anyone.

138
00:07:28.912 --> 00:07:33.287
And engage your audience, this is challenging.

139
00:07:33.287 --> 00:07:35.573
Eye contact is important.

140
00:07:35.573 --> 00:07:37.287
Listening is important.

141
00:07:37.287 --> 00:07:40.287
Ensure the meeting has a good flow and a good cadence.

142
00:07:40.287 --> 00:07:43.087
Create an atmosphere of unselfish contributions and

143
00:07:43.087 --> 00:07:45.364
you will have greater success.

144
00:07:45.364 --> 00:07:51.287
Also, end on time, which means begin on time as well.

145
00:07:51.287 --> 00:07:55.287
Hold tight to your agenda and the time allotted for each agenda item.

146
00:07:55.287 --> 00:07:57.370
You are running the meeting,

147
00:07:57.370 --> 00:08:02.287
you are in control and therefore you are responsible for its total success.

148
00:08:02.287 --> 00:08:06.287
Lastly do a recap, that is quickly recap your notes,

149
00:08:06.287 --> 00:08:07.787
action items, agreements,

150
00:08:07.787 --> 00:08:12.787
also go around the room to ensure everyone has had a

151
00:08:12.787 --> 00:08:15.287
chance to contribute any ending comments.

152
00:08:15.287 --> 00:08:21.287
Alright, now let's look at your follow up activities for a meeting.

153
00:08:21.287 --> 00:08:25.518
Follow up, so after every meeting you must do the following,

154
00:08:25.518 --> 00:08:27.537
send out meeting notes ASAP,

155
00:08:27.537 --> 00:08:32.620
it is critical that you send out meeting notes as soon as possible

156
00:08:32.620 --> 00:08:36.287
within a few hours and no more than the next day,

157
00:08:36.287 --> 00:08:40.287
while still fresh in your mind and in people's mind.

158
00:08:40.287 --> 00:08:41.144
Okay reuse your agenda,

159
00:08:41.144 --> 00:08:45.420
and what I mean by that is use your agenda as a template and fill in the blanks,

160
00:08:45.420 --> 00:08:49.979
that is the space between each item with your notes under each agenda item.

161
00:08:49.979 --> 00:08:52.287
No need to have these disjointed.

162
00:08:52.287 --> 00:08:53.825
So it gives you a nice checklist of collecting your

163
00:08:53.825 --> 00:08:55.210
notes and putting them under each one,

164
00:08:55.210 --> 00:08:57.554
especially if you use your laptop while the meeting is

165
00:08:57.554 --> 00:08:59.420
underway and you can collect the notes,

166
00:08:59.420 --> 00:09:02.144
at least in a kind of a quick and dirty way,

167
00:09:02.144 --> 00:09:04.287
and then later clean them up before you send out.

168
00:09:04.287 --> 00:09:08.620
Send out your meeting minutes or notes as an email and what I mean is

169
00:09:08.620 --> 00:09:12.287
that send out as text in the body of the email.

170
00:09:12.287 --> 00:09:15.144
Or you can send out as an attachment where the

171
00:09:15.144 --> 00:09:17.620
attachment is say a Word document, for example,

172
00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:21.825
and that collects and contains all of your notes and agenda items,

173
00:09:21.825 --> 00:09:22.595
et cetera.

174
00:09:22.595 --> 00:09:27.287
Now sometimes people do not want to click and open an attachment,

175
00:09:27.287 --> 00:09:31.287
either they are too busy or they're on the phone,

176
00:09:31.287 --> 00:09:35.287
so I tend to like to have my notes as text in the body of an email,

177
00:09:35.287 --> 00:09:39.518
so once they open the email it's easy to browse through,

178
00:09:39.518 --> 00:09:41.120
agree, disagree, hit reply.

179
00:09:41.120 --> 00:09:45.758
You're going to get, likely, more feedback on your notes than otherwise.

180
00:09:45.758 --> 00:09:49.662
If it's an attachment I have to detach or I have to click on it and then

181
00:09:49.662 --> 00:09:52.099
I have to open it and then I have to print it maybe,

182
00:09:52.099 --> 00:09:55.287
so sometimes, believe it or not, I know that doesn't sound very complicated,

183
00:09:55.287 --> 00:09:59.287
that's a barrier for some people to actually read your minutes.

184
00:09:59.287 --> 00:10:02.287
Because you want their concurrence or you'll want their ideas about

185
00:10:02.287 --> 00:10:05.287
what you may have missed and things like that.

186
00:10:05.287 --> 00:10:07.196
Now attach any supporting documents if any,

187
00:10:07.196 --> 00:10:10.979
maybe it's a requirements document or an issue list or a

188
00:10:10.979 --> 00:10:13.287
budget spreadsheet and things like that,

189
00:10:13.287 --> 00:10:15.825
now then you want to send out the next meeting request,

190
00:10:15.825 --> 00:10:17.954
and include, of course, date, time, location.

191
00:10:17.954 --> 00:10:21.537
This may or may not yet include the agenda, of course.

192
00:10:21.537 --> 00:10:25.930
But I like to send out a request quickly so they are saving the date,

193
00:10:25.930 --> 00:10:26.573
so to speak,

194
00:10:26.573 --> 00:10:28.902
and then later I can update the meeting request with

195
00:10:28.902 --> 00:10:31.979
the agenda content and in my case, I use Outlook,

196
00:10:31.979 --> 00:10:35.487
Outlook with automatically send out a revised meeting request,

197
00:10:35.487 --> 00:10:38.105
which will contain the agenda within that.

198
00:10:38.105 --> 00:10:42.687
Or you can certainly send out the agenda as just another email.

199
00:10:42.687 --> 00:10:49.000
Either way works fine. Now let's take a moment and look at formal emails.
