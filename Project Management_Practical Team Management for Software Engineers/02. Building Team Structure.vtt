00:00:01.163 --> 00:00:05.163
Building team structure, well now you are responsible for your team,

2
00:00:05.163 --> 00:00:07.163
how should your team be structured?

3
00:00:07.163 --> 00:00:09.163
What are their roles and responsibilities?

4
00:00:09.163 --> 00:00:13.163
Let's explore those topics in this section.

5
00:00:13.163 --> 00:00:14.663
Is structure important?

6
00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:16.163
Yes, very important.

7
00:00:16.163 --> 00:00:20.009
I don't care how big or small your team is,

8
00:00:20.009 --> 00:00:24.981
poor organizational design and structure results in confusion within roles,

9
00:00:24.981 --> 00:00:30.163
a lack of coordination among functions, failure to share ideas,

10
00:00:30.163 --> 00:00:32.163
and slow decision making.

11
00:00:32.163 --> 00:00:37.563
All these can bring your team members unnecessary complexity,

12
00:00:37.563 --> 00:00:39.163
stress, and conflict.

13
00:00:39.163 --> 00:00:43.663
A sound organizational structure ensures that your team has

14
00:00:43.663 --> 00:00:47.163
the right people in the right positions.

15
00:00:47.163 --> 00:00:52.163
Informal structures can lead to the lack of who is responsible for what.

16
00:00:52.163 --> 00:00:53.763
I never leave this to doubt.

17
00:00:53.763 --> 00:00:58.663
Now there are a variety of ways you may want to structure or align your team,

18
00:00:58.663 --> 00:00:59.734
maybe by customer,

19
00:00:59.734 --> 00:01:05.330
that is one or more people on your team are responsible for all products,

20
00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:09.163
all applications, and all services that relate to that customer.

21
00:01:09.163 --> 00:01:14.163
This would be one stop shopping for your customer.

22
00:01:14.163 --> 00:01:19.163
They have one focal point and it makes it easy for them to engage you.

23
00:01:19.163 --> 00:01:20.701
By application or product,

24
00:01:20.701 --> 00:01:26.663
that is one or more people on your team are responsible for the one

25
00:01:26.663 --> 00:01:30.163
application or suite of applications or products.

26
00:01:30.163 --> 00:01:33.240
In this case your team would be very knowledgeable and

27
00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:36.890
experts of these applications and would be supporting

28
00:01:36.890 --> 00:01:40.163
typically a wide range of customers.

29
00:01:40.163 --> 00:01:43.163
Maybe a team is supporting a CRM application or the suite of all

30
00:01:43.163 --> 00:01:47.163
applications that support the sales process.

31
00:01:47.163 --> 00:01:49.663
And possibly by service or function.

32
00:01:49.663 --> 00:01:52.436
This is somewhat similar as by application,

33
00:01:52.436 --> 00:01:56.527
where one or more people on your team are responsible for the one

34
00:01:56.527 --> 00:02:00.163
service or a suite of services or functions.

35
00:02:00.163 --> 00:02:02.163
In this case your team would be, again,

36
00:02:02.163 --> 00:02:05.246
very knowledgeable and experts of these services and would

37
00:02:05.246 --> 00:02:08.163
be supporting a wide range of customers.

38
00:02:08.163 --> 00:02:12.806
Maybe a team is supporting an ad hoc reporting service or an email

39
00:02:12.806 --> 00:02:17.363
service or a collection of cloud utility services.

40
00:02:17.363 --> 00:02:19.163
And lastly, scalability.

41
00:02:19.163 --> 00:02:21.734
And what I mean by this is without structure,

42
00:02:21.734 --> 00:02:24.830
if you try to scale, that is add more employees,

43
00:02:24.830 --> 00:02:29.072
grow in products or services, you're going to have chaos.

44
00:02:29.072 --> 00:02:32.254
With some amount of structure,

45
00:02:32.254 --> 00:02:38.163
scalability can be allowed to flourish and grow your organization.

46
00:02:38.163 --> 00:02:38.580
Okay,

47
00:02:38.580 --> 00:02:43.163
having a structure of who is responsible for what provides clear

48
00:02:43.163 --> 00:02:47.163
management support and guidance for your team members.

49
00:02:47.163 --> 00:02:50.240
So when you are structuring your new group,

50
00:02:50.240 --> 00:02:54.009
come up with a design for each of these,

51
00:02:54.009 --> 00:02:58.163
then ask, does it make sense, is it affordable,

52
00:02:58.163 --> 00:02:58.963
and more forward.

53
00:02:58.963 --> 00:03:00.030
Nothing is in concrete,

54
00:03:00.030 --> 00:03:09.163
give it a go for a few months then inspect and adapt and change if necessary.

55
00:03:09.163 --> 00:03:12.163
Now let's do an example of organizing your team.

56
00:03:12.163 --> 00:03:13.592
So to continue our theme,

57
00:03:13.592 --> 00:03:16.663
you've just started as the manager and you have five

58
00:03:16.663 --> 00:03:20.163
people in the sales app support area.

59
00:03:20.163 --> 00:03:22.913
Now we're going to reach back into our Service Level Agreement

60
00:03:22.913 --> 00:03:26.163
document we did in the previous module and our service

61
00:03:26.163 --> 00:03:30.163
description is to provide all application development and support

62
00:03:30.163 --> 00:03:32.413
for the sales application portfolio.

63
00:03:32.413 --> 00:03:36.496
And also the details are that you have a system called Prospects and

64
00:03:36.496 --> 00:03:41.163
we called another system the Salesforce Interface,

65
00:03:41.163 --> 00:03:44.663
another system the ERP, Enterprise Resource Planning,

66
00:03:44.663 --> 00:03:45.163
Interface.

67
00:03:45.163 --> 00:03:50.163
Now I have titled this slide from chaos to structure for a reason.

68
00:03:50.163 --> 00:03:54.563
I have seen many organizations and departments that are just a bunch of

69
00:03:54.563 --> 00:03:58.963
random people working real hard and doing a pretty good job,

70
00:03:58.963 --> 00:04:02.163
but I believe very strongly that with structure,

71
00:04:02.163 --> 00:04:02.563
roles,

72
00:04:02.563 --> 00:04:05.941
and responsibilities you can significantly improve performance and

73
00:04:05.941 --> 00:04:09.020
provide a platform for scalability into the future.

74
00:04:09.020 --> 00:04:16.163
Okay, let's check out the next slide and how I would organize your new team.

75
00:04:16.163 --> 00:04:19.913
Alright so we have the SLA as a backdrop and what we want to do

76
00:04:19.913 --> 00:04:23.163
now is look at what do we have at our disposal?

77
00:04:23.163 --> 00:04:25.625
What are our as-is-personnel?

78
00:04:25.625 --> 00:04:31.163
Today I have two people who work on Prospects.

79
00:04:31.163 --> 00:04:36.163
I have one person who works on Salesforce interface about half time.

80
00:04:36.163 --> 00:04:40.163
I have one new person that was assigned to me.

81
00:04:40.163 --> 00:04:44.163
I have also a person who's working on the ERP interface.

82
00:04:44.163 --> 00:04:46.663
So my total head count are five people.

83
00:04:46.663 --> 00:04:51.092
So I have my SLA as a backdrop so I know what I'm supposed to be doing.

84
00:04:51.092 --> 00:04:54.030
Here are the five people that were assigned to me and I've

85
00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:56.163
just been promoted to be a new manager.

86
00:04:56.163 --> 00:04:57.592
How might that structure look?

87
00:04:57.592 --> 00:05:04.163
Okay let's take a look at that in the next slide.

88
00:05:04.163 --> 00:05:07.163
So here's a concept and approach for your new organization.

89
00:05:07.163 --> 00:05:09.345
First off, I like leaders and leadership roles,

90
00:05:09.345 --> 00:05:12.030
that is someone is clearly in charge at all times,

91
00:05:12.030 --> 00:05:15.413
no fuzz, for all the things you are responsible for.

92
00:05:15.413 --> 00:05:19.163
Okay, of course there is you.

93
00:05:19.163 --> 00:05:23.163
And how I might do it, I might align along applications and functions as follows.

94
00:05:23.163 --> 00:05:25.163
First, the Prospect System.

95
00:05:25.163 --> 00:05:28.163
I'll probably put a leader there,

96
00:05:28.163 --> 00:05:31.436
and be responsible for all aspects of the Prospect

97
00:05:31.436 --> 00:05:33.072
System across multiple customers.

98
00:05:33.072 --> 00:05:34.436
Next, Salesforce Interface,

99
00:05:34.436 --> 00:05:39.163
I look at that a little bit more as a function than an application.

100
00:05:39.163 --> 00:05:41.163
I want a leader there as well.

101
00:05:41.163 --> 00:05:45.163
Next, the ERP Interface, that's kind of a function as well.

102
00:05:45.163 --> 00:05:49.163
I want a leader to be there also.

103
00:05:49.163 --> 00:05:51.163
So of your five team member,

104
00:05:51.163 --> 00:05:54.708
maybe three will be those leaders as I have proposed here.

105
00:05:54.708 --> 00:05:56.345
And the remaining folks, of course,

106
00:05:56.345 --> 00:06:00.734
are just remaining team members that could work for any of the leaders

107
00:06:00.734 --> 00:06:03.496
or directly for you on any assignments whatsoever.

108
00:06:03.496 --> 00:06:05.496
So it has a simple structure,

109
00:06:05.496 --> 00:06:09.799
you know who's in charge for what application and function,

110
00:06:09.799 --> 00:06:12.394
and the members know this as well.

111
00:06:12.394 --> 00:06:15.163
Plus they know they can also work for anyone.

112
00:06:15.163 --> 00:06:19.163
Those remaining team members will be a pool of people.

113
00:06:19.163 --> 00:06:23.163
Now again, I'm going to talk more about roles and responsibilities,

114
00:06:23.163 --> 00:06:25.663
but I look at these as roles.

115
00:06:25.663 --> 00:06:29.020
Maybe the leader of the Salesforce Interface is the

116
00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:31.592
same person as the ERP Interface,

117
00:06:31.592 --> 00:06:35.763
but these are three clear roles of responsibility that I

118
00:06:35.763 --> 00:06:38.163
will staff on the following slides.

119
00:06:38.163 --> 00:06:42.163
Now for one five people, you likely don't need a true org chart,

120
00:06:42.163 --> 00:06:44.009
but this really is quite clear.

121
00:06:44.009 --> 00:06:47.663
But you do need these clear roles and responsibilities so

122
00:06:47.663 --> 00:06:56.000
everyone knows what is expected of them. Now let's also build those roles and responsibilities in the next slides.
