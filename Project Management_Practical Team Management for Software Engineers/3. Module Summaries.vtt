00:00:00.545 --> 00:00:03.545
Aligning IT activities to the business.

2
00:00:03.545 --> 00:00:06.515
Why align IT to the business?

3
00:00:06.515 --> 00:00:09.505
Remember, according to the Info-Tech research study,

4
00:00:09.505 --> 00:00:14.535
47% of business leaders feel that business goals are unsupported by IT.

5
00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:19.079
What this means is that the business may change the leaders of IT or maybe even

6
00:00:19.079 --> 00:00:22.495
outsource IT if we look at it from an IT-centric viewpoint.

7
00:00:22.495 --> 00:00:26.465
From a business standpoint, the business suffers of course.

8
00:00:26.465 --> 00:00:27.495
Understanding alignment.

9
00:00:27.495 --> 00:00:27.878
So,

10
00:00:27.878 --> 00:00:31.681
alignment means that IT effectively can achieve business objectives

11
00:00:31.681 --> 00:00:36.505
resultant in improved business outcomes that produce business value

12
00:00:36.505 --> 00:00:39.545
aligning IT team goals to business goals.

13
00:00:39.545 --> 00:00:39.937
Now,

14
00:00:39.937 --> 00:00:45.165
in that section we went through a complete example from a business goal to

15
00:00:45.165 --> 00:00:49.555
a IT project task or activity in a very visible format,

16
00:00:49.555 --> 00:00:54.498
easy for the business to see, read and understand and of course,

17
00:00:54.498 --> 00:00:56.465
easy for your team as well.

18
00:00:56.465 --> 00:00:57.495
Defining priorities.

19
00:00:57.495 --> 00:01:00.929
We discussed sources of priorities that is where they can

20
00:01:00.929 --> 00:01:04.687
come from and the quality of their priority from vague to

21
00:01:04.687 --> 00:01:07.465
very detailed and lastly, setting priorities,

22
00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:09.545
that's based on your interpretation of the priority.

23
00:01:09.545 --> 00:01:14.107
You could use a project card and a priority grid to easily and

24
00:01:14.107 --> 00:01:17.757
quickly and visually layout priorities and color code statuses to

25
00:01:17.757 --> 00:01:22.475
make it easy for the business to see, read and understand.

26
00:01:22.475 --> 00:01:26.505
Now, if you could have at least one takeaway from this module,

27
00:01:26.505 --> 00:01:29.465
everything we did is for the business.

28
00:01:29.465 --> 00:01:31.475
In your new role as an IT manger,

29
00:01:31.475 --> 00:01:36.061
that is it's helping the business be successful and if you do this it will

30
00:01:36.061 --> 00:01:39.555
only follow that your career will be successful as well.

31
00:01:39.555 --> 00:01:45.525
Now, let's see how we could better communicate and keep our customers happy.

32
00:01:45.525 --> 00:01:48.465
Managing customer expectations.

33
00:01:48.465 --> 00:01:50.555
Why manage customer expectations?

34
00:01:50.555 --> 00:01:55.785
We learned that the secret of customer satisfaction lies not just in what you

35
00:01:55.785 --> 00:01:59.535
necessarily do but at what the customer expects you to do.

36
00:01:59.535 --> 00:02:03.995
We defined customer expectations, we discussed the relative worth,

37
00:02:03.995 --> 00:02:07.954
merit and importance of understanding customer expectations and why

38
00:02:07.954 --> 00:02:12.015
these can make you and your team optimize your capabilities,. We

39
00:02:12.015 --> 00:02:15.871
discussed several strategies for managing customer expectations such

40
00:02:15.871 --> 00:02:18.535
as quality of communications, verbal and written,

41
00:02:18.535 --> 00:02:20.495
knowing your limitations,

42
00:02:20.495 --> 00:02:24.828
that is know what you and your team are truly capable of and

43
00:02:24.828 --> 00:02:26.545
ensuring your customer understands that,

44
00:02:26.545 --> 00:02:28.525
setting clear timelines,

45
00:02:28.525 --> 00:02:31.883
remaining practical yet still show optimism and

46
00:02:31.883 --> 00:02:37.525
learning how to say no by saying yes, but or choose among options.

47
00:02:37.525 --> 00:02:40.909
Service level agreements, expectations are specific,

48
00:02:40.909 --> 00:02:44.505
not fuzzy, so expectations are in writing,

49
00:02:44.505 --> 00:02:48.241
expectations can be measured and we did constructed service level

50
00:02:48.241 --> 00:02:51.535
agreement by business attribute and we gave some examples.

51
00:02:51.535 --> 00:02:57.500
Valuing customer service or measuring customer service by using my simple

52
00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:02.095
customer service quadrant approach to isolate each of your services or

53
00:03:02.095 --> 00:03:04.485
products and allow the customer to rank them.

54
00:03:04.485 --> 00:03:07.185
This gives you valuable information to better focus your team's

55
00:03:07.185 --> 00:03:10.535
efforts and reset the customer's expectations.

56
00:03:10.535 --> 00:03:11.667
Lastly, please embrace,

57
00:03:11.667 --> 00:03:17.074
live and breath the fact that every single customer interaction is

58
00:03:17.074 --> 00:03:20.545
an opportunity to manage customer expectations.

59
00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:22.535
Building team structure.

60
00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:27.465
We learned that some structure, no matter how large your team is important.

61
00:03:27.465 --> 00:03:31.113
We explored a few ways to structure your team such as by customer,

62
00:03:31.113 --> 00:03:35.495
application, product, service or function or a hybrid.

63
00:03:35.495 --> 00:03:39.465
This enables parts of your team to be more customer or outward facing

64
00:03:39.465 --> 00:03:43.976
and everyone to know exactly clearly who is responsible for what and

65
00:03:43.976 --> 00:03:47.485
provides a platform for scalability as well.

66
00:03:47.485 --> 00:03:50.099
We learned that a role is a description of what you

67
00:03:50.099 --> 00:03:51.555
generally do each day at your work.

68
00:03:51.555 --> 00:03:56.515
Some examples may be manager, database administrator, software engineer.

69
00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:59.851
Also you must document in writing each role that's

70
00:03:59.851 --> 00:04:02.485
required for you to fulfill your job,

71
00:04:02.485 --> 00:04:07.485
ensure each person knows their role or roles and keep it up to date.

72
00:04:07.485 --> 00:04:10.485
A responsibility is a duty or collection of duties

73
00:04:10.485 --> 00:04:14.535
in the course of doing one's job, such as designing relational databases,

74
00:04:14.535 --> 00:04:18.545
providing technical leadership or perform business analysis.

75
00:04:18.545 --> 00:04:22.465
A collection of responsibilities makes up a role.

76
00:04:22.465 --> 00:04:23.525
Building team skills.

77
00:04:23.525 --> 00:04:26.943
We learned that not only are technical skills important you know,

78
00:04:26.943 --> 00:04:28.545
the alphabet soup skills if you will,

79
00:04:28.545 --> 00:04:31.525
but also communication and leadership skills.

80
00:04:31.525 --> 00:04:36.465
These two other skill areas are in my opinion just as important.

81
00:04:36.465 --> 00:04:38.465
Determining skill requirements.

82
00:04:38.465 --> 00:04:42.681
We discussed my six-step process on how to determine the skills your

83
00:04:42.681 --> 00:04:45.515
team needs and to create a basic training plan.

84
00:04:45.515 --> 00:04:49.475
I recommend you revisit your plan about each quarter or as needed.

85
00:04:49.475 --> 00:04:50.535
Informal training ideas.

86
00:04:50.535 --> 00:04:53.717
We learned about luncheon learns and how you could provide training

87
00:04:53.717 --> 00:04:57.485
in an informal setting and build team comradery.

88
00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:01.475
Also, presentation skills can be improved for the person presenting.

89
00:05:01.475 --> 00:05:04.350
We also touched on dinner and develop to help your team get

90
00:05:04.350 --> 00:05:07.515
started in possibly a newer technology.

91
00:05:07.515 --> 00:05:10.555
Also we discussed vendor events where vendors are talking about their products

92
00:05:10.555 --> 00:05:16.083
or services but made to provide a quick and zero-cost way to learn about a

93
00:05:16.083 --> 00:05:19.311
topic and lastly in this section we discussed how to grow your team member

94
00:05:19.311 --> 00:05:22.848
skills and capabilities through on-the-job,

95
00:05:22.848 --> 00:05:27.515
OJT, opportunities by giving them assignments and providing a mentor,

96
00:05:27.515 --> 00:05:30.341
team leader or yourself to guide them and give them the

97
00:05:30.341 --> 00:05:33.485
support and encouragement that they need.

98
00:05:33.485 --> 00:05:34.505
Performance reviews.

99
00:05:34.505 --> 00:05:38.885
We discussed how performance reviews contribute to building team

100
00:05:38.885 --> 00:05:42.255
capabilities by determining the areas of improvement which may

101
00:05:42.255 --> 00:05:44.505
drive additions to your training plan.

102
00:05:44.505 --> 00:05:45.535
Motivating your team.

103
00:05:45.535 --> 00:05:49.502
Yes, there are many ways to motivate your team from awards,

104
00:05:49.502 --> 00:05:50.508
thanks yous,

105
00:05:50.508 --> 00:05:54.936
bonuses etc., but a more subtle and systematic way is to

106
00:05:54.936 --> 00:05:56.515
align your team's work to the business,

107
00:05:56.515 --> 00:06:00.654
connecting your team with the customer and providing consistent performance

108
00:06:00.654 --> 00:06:04.505
reviews and actions such as training from those reviews.

109
00:06:04.505 --> 00:06:08.733
These management practices are not one-offs like an award but instead an

110
00:06:08.733 --> 00:06:13.555
integral part of how you manage your team consistently every day.

111
00:06:13.555 --> 00:06:19.465
The results are a team that is nurtured, content, motivated and productive.

112
00:06:19.465 --> 00:06:23.475
Okay, acquiring the right talent.

113
00:06:23.475 --> 00:06:24.465
Retention.

114
00:06:24.465 --> 00:06:26.515
Before you start hiring or replacing people,

115
00:06:26.515 --> 00:06:29.515
take a look inward and determine your retention rate,

116
00:06:29.515 --> 00:06:33.505
that is how many people stay working for you over a period of time

117
00:06:33.505 --> 00:06:35.525
compared to the total people working for you.

118
00:06:35.525 --> 00:06:37.965
A simple example is that if you have five people for

119
00:06:37.965 --> 00:06:40.485
a 12-month period and one leaves,

120
00:06:40.485 --> 00:06:43.515
your retention is four divided by five which is 80%

121
00:06:43.515 --> 00:06:47.495
and that sounds kind of bad really, so I would pro rate it using months.

122
00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:47.779
Also,

123
00:06:47.779 --> 00:06:50.832
you want to look at things that improve retention such

124
00:06:50.832 --> 00:06:53.281
as recognizing and rewarding people,

125
00:06:53.281 --> 00:06:55.214
offering learning and growth opportunities and lastly,

126
00:06:55.214 --> 00:06:57.555
don't forget, they don't leave the company,

127
00:06:57.555 --> 00:06:59.545
they leave you.

128
00:06:59.545 --> 00:07:01.515
Finding the right talent.

129
00:07:01.515 --> 00:07:05.545
We talked about hiring not only from the outside of your company but inside.

130
00:07:05.545 --> 00:07:08.505
I suggest always looking inside first,

131
00:07:08.505 --> 00:07:13.095
so you'll want to also look how the new hire may add value for

132
00:07:13.095 --> 00:07:17.336
longer range portfolio transitions or new skills you didn't

133
00:07:17.336 --> 00:07:22.165
originally realize may be of value or new capabilities such as a

134
00:07:22.165 --> 00:07:25.495
very poised speaker or succession planning,

135
00:07:25.495 --> 00:07:28.865
someone who could potentially replace you and lastly,

136
00:07:28.865 --> 00:07:29.525
diversity,

137
00:07:29.525 --> 00:07:35.475
some of the viewpoints that may bring a whole new emphasis to your team.

138
00:07:35.475 --> 00:07:37.545
Defining the job requirements.

139
00:07:37.545 --> 00:07:40.495
First understand exactly why you are hiring.

140
00:07:40.495 --> 00:07:43.485
This will of course help you define the new job requirements.

141
00:07:43.485 --> 00:07:43.712
Sure,

142
00:07:43.712 --> 00:07:47.021
you will need to acquire new technical skills or possibly improve

143
00:07:47.021 --> 00:07:51.311
some that you already have but you will also need to look for

144
00:07:51.311 --> 00:07:53.555
leadership and communication skills.

145
00:07:53.555 --> 00:07:55.545
People need to write effectively,

146
00:07:55.545 --> 00:07:59.384
speak effectively and interact effectively to work

147
00:07:59.384 --> 00:08:01.505
with your customers and management.

148
00:08:01.505 --> 00:08:03.465
The acquisition process.

149
00:08:03.465 --> 00:08:06.525
We discussed my six-step acquisition process.

150
00:08:06.525 --> 00:08:10.485
Step one, document and post your new hire skill requirements.

151
00:08:10.485 --> 00:08:13.465
Step two, screen, and phone,

152
00:08:13.465 --> 00:08:15.792
so you are narrowing your large pile of resumes to

153
00:08:15.792 --> 00:08:17.515
those that pass your phone interview.

154
00:08:17.515 --> 00:08:22.485
Next, step three is the in-person interview and test potentially.

155
00:08:22.485 --> 00:08:24.383
You may also want one or more of your team members

156
00:08:24.383 --> 00:08:27.485
involved in that interview process.

157
00:08:27.485 --> 00:08:29.525
Step four, follow on interviews.

158
00:08:29.525 --> 00:08:31.465
Using one interview is not enough.

159
00:08:31.465 --> 00:08:33.545
After you have interviewed your first round of candidates,

160
00:08:33.545 --> 00:08:37.538
I suggest you narrow down to just two or three and have a

161
00:08:37.538 --> 00:08:39.525
second interview with each of those.

162
00:08:39.525 --> 00:08:41.535
Step five, selection.

163
00:08:41.535 --> 00:08:41.814
Now,

164
00:08:41.814 --> 00:08:45.258
you pick the one you want but have a back up in case

165
00:08:45.258 --> 00:08:46.525
that person declines your offer.

166
00:08:46.525 --> 00:08:47.535
That can happen.

167
00:08:47.535 --> 00:08:51.535
Step six, the normal HR or company paperwork.

168
00:08:51.535 --> 00:08:54.525
Well, preparing your questions, what are you going to ask them?

169
00:08:54.525 --> 00:08:57.597
It is important to prepare your questions so you can pull out

170
00:08:57.597 --> 00:08:59.535
the information you need from that person.

171
00:08:59.535 --> 00:09:03.625
You may also want a test or maybe a program to write

172
00:09:03.625 --> 00:09:06.475
to test their skills objectively.

173
00:09:06.475 --> 00:09:11.485
The other questions again are critical to getting them talking.

174
00:09:11.485 --> 00:09:12.475
Onboarding.

175
00:09:12.475 --> 00:09:15.515
Lastly we discussed your checklist of activities for the new person.

176
00:09:15.515 --> 00:09:18.545
First, introductions, then business alignment,

177
00:09:18.545 --> 00:09:21.749
your customers, structure, roles, responsibilities,

178
00:09:21.749 --> 00:09:26.465
and the processes that your team follows.

179
00:09:26.465 --> 00:09:29.782
Then they get their first assignment or two and are assigned a mentor which

180
00:09:29.782 --> 00:09:33.525
may be yourself but I prefer a mentor to be a coworker.

181
00:09:33.525 --> 00:09:36.672
This builds the mentoring skill of the mentor and helps

182
00:09:36.672 --> 00:09:39.465
build a relationship between them.

183
00:09:39.465 --> 00:09:39.752
Alright,

184
00:09:39.752 --> 00:09:43.232
now let's look at the summary of the next module on communication

185
00:09:43.232 --> 00:09:48.515
skills and how important they are for you as a manager.

186
00:09:48.515 --> 00:09:51.465
Managing through effective communication.

187
00:09:51.465 --> 00:09:57.138
We talked about informal communication techniques such as stand ups,

188
00:09:57.138 --> 00:10:00.545
walk arounds, emails, and daily interactions.

189
00:10:00.545 --> 00:10:01.872
These are all very,

190
00:10:01.872 --> 00:10:04.545
very important but informal forms of communication

191
00:10:04.545 --> 00:10:08.495
that should happen every single day.

192
00:10:08.495 --> 00:10:11.475
Then there's the more formal types of communication.

193
00:10:11.475 --> 00:10:13.485
You're going to be making presentations,

194
00:10:13.485 --> 00:10:14.545
you're going to be holding meetings,

195
00:10:14.545 --> 00:10:17.919
you're going to be sending more formal email statuses

196
00:10:17.919 --> 00:10:21.535
potentially or just regular emails to customers or maybe

197
00:10:21.535 --> 00:10:23.705
senior management and of course,

198
00:10:23.705 --> 00:10:27.741
status reporting needs to be pretty structured and pretty formal to look very,

199
00:10:27.741 --> 00:10:31.082
very professional and of course being an effective

200
00:10:31.082 --> 00:10:35.465
communicator means being a really, really good listener,

201
00:10:35.465 --> 00:10:40.555
so listen to everyone, customers, management and your team well.

202
00:10:40.555 --> 00:10:45.495
Lastly, read my lips, it's all about the people.

203
00:10:45.495 --> 00:10:48.485
People is what makes it all happen.

204
00:10:48.485 --> 00:10:48.739
Okay,

205
00:10:48.739 --> 00:10:52.212
now let's look at the key processes that you'll need to put in

206
00:10:52.212 --> 00:10:56.465
place to run a smooth and productive team.

207
00:10:56.465 --> 00:10:58.525
Promoting productivity through team processes.

208
00:10:58.525 --> 00:11:04.525
In this module I gave you a starter list or a starter kit of 10 key processes.

209
00:11:04.525 --> 00:11:04.774
Now,

210
00:11:04.774 --> 00:11:07.313
what's important in the summary here though is really

211
00:11:07.313 --> 00:11:10.505
what are your key processes going to be?

212
00:11:10.505 --> 00:11:15.000
I suggest you can start with my 10 or a subset of my 10 and then you

213
00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:18.525
could evolve those or change those as you see necessary,

214
00:11:18.525 --> 00:11:23.485
so first determine your key processes, start with mine first if you like,

215
00:11:23.485 --> 00:11:26.525
come up with new ones if you like but make sure they're documented.

216
00:11:26.525 --> 00:11:29.485
Now, use these in this module as a start of course.

217
00:11:29.485 --> 00:11:31.475
I think that's really, really good and helpful.

218
00:11:31.475 --> 00:11:33.530
I've laid everything out for you and you can add,

219
00:11:33.530 --> 00:11:36.495
remove or improve them as you see fit.

220
00:11:36.495 --> 00:11:39.465
Always document the processes not matter what.

221
00:11:39.465 --> 00:11:42.485
That way you can educate and train your team.

222
00:11:42.485 --> 00:11:44.525
If your customer's curious about your processes,

223
00:11:44.525 --> 00:11:49.478
then you can show them say a document or a PowerPoint that would explain

224
00:11:49.478 --> 00:11:53.465
each of your processes as well and continuously improve.

225
00:11:53.465 --> 00:11:56.964
No process is set in stone is going to last forever so

226
00:11:56.964 --> 00:11:59.475
you'll want to revisit your processes.

227
00:11:59.475 --> 00:12:02.475
Again, I suggest once a quarter or as needed.

228
00:12:02.475 --> 00:12:05.465
If an issue comes up, go ahead and tackle that process,

229
00:12:05.465 --> 00:12:11.000
find an improvement for it, update the documentation, educate and train.
