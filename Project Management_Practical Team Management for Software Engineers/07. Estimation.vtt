00:00:00.760 --> 00:00:05.760
I know we all love to make estimates, uh not.

2
00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:10.760
When I ask for an estimate the response I get is like a deer in the headlights.

3
00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:14.331
Well making an estimate is tough and what I think

4
00:00:14.331 --> 00:00:17.843
makes it so tough is that the person, manager,

5
00:00:17.843 --> 00:00:22.843
executive or customer that is asking you for the estimate expects perfection.

6
00:00:22.843 --> 00:00:31.204
But wait a minute, it is just an estimate, so what is an estimate?

7
00:00:31.204 --> 00:00:32.760
Let's see.

8
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:33.260
Estimation,

9
00:00:33.260 --> 00:00:37.760
it's the process of predicting the most realistic amount

10
00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:40.760
of effort expressed in terms of hours,

11
00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.093
money or some unit required to develop or maintain software

12
00:00:46.093 --> 00:00:50.760
based on incomplete or uncertain input.

13
00:00:50.760 --> 00:00:53.960
Aren't we all a little nervous when our manager or customer says something like,

14
00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:55.760
hey, can you give me an estimate for this?

15
00:00:55.760 --> 00:00:59.760
But don't worry, I will not hold you to it.

16
00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:05.760
Yes, they seem to never forget that first estimate.

17
00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:07.760
Even though making estimates are hard,

18
00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:11.474
I still truly believe that estimation is a very important

19
00:01:11.474 --> 00:01:15.760
activity and a key activity for you and your team.

20
00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:17.427
Okay, go/no go decision.

21
00:01:17.427 --> 00:01:21.683
So making a good estimate will give you the information you need,

22
00:01:21.683 --> 00:01:24.649
for example should we even be doing this activity or project,

23
00:01:24.649 --> 00:01:27.760
or is there a return on investment?

24
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:32.760
Next, it enhances the setting and managing of customer expectations.

25
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.360
Quality estimates enable you to better manage your customer's

26
00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.760
expectations so the customer knows what the costs are to expect.

27
00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.942
Provides a foundation for accurate project costs,

28
00:01:43.942 --> 00:01:48.560
so a solid process for creating quality estimates provides the core

29
00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:52.529
foundations for more accurate project costs in the future.

30
00:01:52.529 --> 00:01:57.427
So as you proceed you can better compare actuals versus estimates.

31
00:01:57.427 --> 00:02:02.760
So if you keep the analysis and your model for making an estimate,

32
00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.360
you can reuse those,

33
00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:09.222
as well as if you track your time when you actually build the software,

34
00:02:09.222 --> 00:02:12.546
you can then later compare your actual costs to time

35
00:02:12.546 --> 00:02:17.560
or hours against your estimates, look at the delta and make improvements.

36
00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:21.760
Okay next, drives high level project scoping.

37
00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.760
So for an initial project, somewhat large,

38
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.760
you need to be able to have a basis for guiding the

39
00:02:27.760 --> 00:02:29.760
prioritization of features to implement,

40
00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:31.093
which are not detailed,

41
00:02:31.093 --> 00:02:35.093
but are high level features with early estimates to help you

42
00:02:35.093 --> 00:02:37.760
prioritize what features to implement first.

43
00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:43.760
Next, let's see what you need for making a reasonable estimate.

44
00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:47.760
Here are some things I think you need to make a reasonable estimate.

45
00:02:47.760 --> 00:02:52.760
The definition of work, your requirements or project definition.

46
00:02:52.760 --> 00:02:55.760
Remember the last section we talked about making good requirements,

47
00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:57.606
without good requirements it makes it pretty tough

48
00:02:57.606 --> 00:02:59.510
to make a really good estimate.

49
00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.760
Next, management support.

50
00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:07.260
Is your management supportive of you to take time to follow

51
00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:09.760
your process to make a good estimate?

52
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:13.474
So you may need to educate your management on the return investment for

53
00:03:13.474 --> 00:03:17.760
spending adequate time developing quality estimates.

54
00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.093
So don't be shy.

55
00:03:19.093 --> 00:03:21.760
Next, knowledge of available resources for the project.

56
00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:25.760
In other words, what resources may be at your disposal?

57
00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.427
Developers, consultants, subject matter experts,

58
00:03:27.427 --> 00:03:30.010
for example, that will help you build your estimate.

59
00:03:30.010 --> 00:03:34.331
It's one thing to make an estimate of an area you know about,

60
00:03:34.331 --> 00:03:38.033
but for other areas of technology or business process,

61
00:03:38.033 --> 00:03:40.760
you're going to need to bring in subject matter experts

62
00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:42.760
to help you make a better estimate.

63
00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:46.093
Next you're going to need some time to make that estimate.

64
00:03:46.093 --> 00:03:49.936
So be sure you allocate enough time proportional to the size of effort,

65
00:03:49.936 --> 00:03:52.760
based on the size of effort or the size of the project,

66
00:03:52.760 --> 00:03:54.760
you might need a little more time.

67
00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:56.760
In order to build that accurate estimate,

68
00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:59.760
again, we're going to need management support so you can go do that.

69
00:03:59.760 --> 00:04:02.298
And then, of course, you're going to need an estimating process,

70
00:04:02.298 --> 00:04:04.683
in fact, your process for making estimates.

71
00:04:04.683 --> 00:04:08.578
So with a solid process of your own, you will succeed,

72
00:04:08.578 --> 00:04:11.305
and your team, at creating and improving your estimation skills.

73
00:04:11.305 --> 00:04:12.669
Now this does take time,

74
00:04:12.669 --> 00:04:17.760
and that's just what we'll be doing in the next modules as well.

75
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.760
Alright, so if I have piqued your interest in the estimation practices,

76
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.760
let's see where you can learn more about estimation.

77
00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.760
As I mentioned, each section in this module could in fact be a complete course,

78
00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.546
Well I would like to recommend to you another one of my Pluralsight

79
00:04:34.546 --> 00:04:37.260
courses titled Best Practices for Project Estimation,

80
00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:48.000
which will be a nice adjunct or companion course for this course. Now let's do some design and architecture work in the next section.
