00:00:01.013 --> 00:00:05.043
So, here are some great companion courses that tie very nicely into this course.

2
00:00:05.043 --> 00:00:06.023
The first,

3
00:00:06.023 --> 00:00:09.256
Leadership and Communication Skills for Software Engineers and

4
00:00:09.256 --> 00:00:11.043
I've said it many times throughout this course,

5
00:00:11.043 --> 00:00:15.053
leadership and communication is very, very key for you as a manager.

6
00:00:15.053 --> 00:00:18.033
Next, Project Management for Software Engineers.

7
00:00:18.033 --> 00:00:22.963
You'll probably have some projects to run too as a manager or part of your team.

8
00:00:22.963 --> 00:00:24.963
Best Practices for Requirements Gathering.

9
00:00:24.963 --> 00:00:27.590
We know the requirements are a key element of your job and

10
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:31.053
lastly Best Practices for Project Estimation.

11
00:00:31.053 --> 00:00:33.000
Making estimate, it's tough,

12
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:35.033
it's hard and there's some good templates and models

13
00:00:35.033 --> 00:00:42.000
and approaches to that as well. So, so long and I'll see you in my next Pluralsight course.
