1
00:00:00,970 --> 00:00:03,470
Step 4, integrate lists and prioritize.

2
00:00:03,470 --> 00:00:08,970
We all know that budgets are always limited so you will have to prioritize.

3
00:00:08,970 --> 00:00:12,970
So as a team exercise itemize all the training needed and go

4
00:00:12,970 --> 00:00:15,303
over each item making down its priority.

5
00:00:15,303 --> 00:00:19,041
There should be a group discussion with you breaking the ties.

6
00:00:19,041 --> 00:00:22,256
I just kept it simple by using high, medium,

7
00:00:22,256 --> 00:00:24,124
and low as priority indicators,

8
00:00:24,124 --> 00:00:27,970
but you could use a different criteria if you'd like.

9
00:00:27,970 --> 00:00:30,697
You might also consider delivery dates of projects to the

10
00:00:30,697 --> 00:00:33,470
customers since that can drive priority,

11
00:00:33,470 --> 00:00:33,970
certainly.

12
00:00:33,970 --> 00:00:36,879
Sometimes the skills that your team will personally

13
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,970
select may fall to lower priorities, be sure you explain why this is.

14
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:45,970
In other words, the priority is the business over personal ambitions.

15
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:51,970
But try and champion more budget if you can to support their needs.

16
00:00:51,970 --> 00:00:54,970
Now let's sort with the higher priorities going to the top.

17
00:00:54,970 --> 00:00:56,370
Okay, so this is a little nicer.

18
00:00:56,370 --> 00:00:58,770
We can see what is the most important on top.

19
00:00:58,770 --> 00:01:03,970
We have the highs up front, then the mediums, and now the lows.

20
00:01:03,970 --> 00:01:07,970
Now let's develop a plan and implement.

21
00:01:07,970 --> 00:01:10,970
Step 5, develop a plan and implement.

22
00:01:10,970 --> 00:01:15,303
So first we want to secure approvals and then secure budget.

23
00:01:15,303 --> 00:01:18,613
You won't have much training if you don't have any budget.

24
00:01:18,613 --> 00:01:23,470
Next we want to find the sources, where are we going to get that training from?

25
00:01:23,470 --> 00:01:26,970
So some examples might be external companies,

26
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:29,470
like Pluralsight, educational institutions,

27
00:01:29,470 --> 00:01:33,508
maybe some internal experts that work in your company,

28
00:01:33,508 --> 00:01:33,816
self-study,

29
00:01:33,816 --> 00:01:38,739
and then you need to go out and schedule that training and maybe

30
00:01:38,739 --> 00:01:43,637
even some trainings more just in time where maybe you learn the

31
00:01:43,637 --> 00:01:46,893
training in classroom or internet-based and then you follow up by

32
00:01:46,893 --> 00:01:49,637
mentoring in just in time where you actually apply what you've

33
00:01:49,637 --> 00:01:51,303
learned directly on a project.

34
00:01:51,303 --> 00:01:55,158
I find this really important and really effective as well.

35
00:01:55,158 --> 00:01:59,970
Okay, so now let's take a look at a sample plan.

36
00:01:59,970 --> 00:02:03,970
Step 5: training skills implementation plan.

37
00:02:03,970 --> 00:02:06,637
So let's lay out a very simple plan.

38
00:02:06,637 --> 00:02:09,827
We added three new columns to the previous chart.

39
00:02:09,827 --> 00:02:16,041
The first is budget, that is how much we think we need for that training.

40
00:02:16,041 --> 00:02:21,256
The next is source, that is where we're going to get the training from.

41
00:02:21,256 --> 00:02:26,541
And lastly, the last column is when we need to be trained by,

42
00:02:26,541 --> 00:02:32,470
the date, and if we are not sure of any of these we just put TBD,

43
00:02:32,470 --> 00:02:34,970
please don't leave blank.

44
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:38,970
Okay now let's see the final step.

45
00:02:38,970 --> 00:02:43,970
Step 6 I call inspect, adapt, and repeat.

46
00:02:43,970 --> 00:02:46,739
So you want to review your plan as needed,

47
00:02:46,739 --> 00:02:50,470
maybe review quarterly or under special new business circumstances,

48
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:53,870
update by following the steps we already covered,

49
00:02:53,870 --> 00:02:55,970
adjust the budget and plan as necessary.

50
00:02:55,970 --> 00:02:59,684
Now in the next section let's take a look at some easy and

51
00:02:59,684 --> 00:03:06,000
effective training ideas to augment the traditional training we have just talked about.
