00:00:02,139 --> 00:00:02,939
Understanding alignment.

2
00:00:02,939 --> 00:00:08,866
Now let's see what alignment means and the effects of bad alignment and

3
00:00:08,866 --> 00:00:14,139
good alignment of your IT activities with the business.

4
00:00:14,139 --> 00:00:20,139
Here's a text book definition, a bunch of words, I know, but they are important.

5
00:00:20,139 --> 00:00:25,139
Alignment to the business: It's the art and science of formulating,

6
00:00:25,139 --> 00:00:31,139
integrating, and implementing decisions between the business and IT,

7
00:00:31,139 --> 00:00:35,139
which enables an organization to achieve its objectives.

8
00:00:35,139 --> 00:00:37,139
Yes a bunch of words, but they are important.

9
00:00:37,139 --> 00:00:40,339
Now let's deconstruct this statement to more fully

10
00:00:40,339 --> 00:00:45,139
understand its meaning and implications.

11
00:00:45,139 --> 00:00:51,139
So when someone in a company says we have aligned our IT to the business,

12
00:00:51,139 --> 00:00:52,568
here is what they mean.

13
00:00:52,568 --> 00:00:56,472
It is when a business organization is able to use information

14
00:00:56,472 --> 00:01:01,139
technology effectively to achieve its business objectives.

15
00:01:01,139 --> 00:01:04,139
Also resulting in improved business outcomes,

16
00:01:04,139 --> 00:01:08,710
such as improved financial performance, better products,

17
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:12,139
services, or marketplace competitiveness.

18
00:01:12,139 --> 00:01:19,139
The bottom line is the ability of IT to produce business value.

19
00:01:19,139 --> 00:01:24,639
Now here's a simple tip: So here's a tip to prove

20
00:01:24,639 --> 00:01:27,139
your team is adding business value.

21
00:01:27,139 --> 00:01:29,710
For everything you do in IT,

22
00:01:29,710 --> 00:01:35,068
can you say the following: What my team is doing now…,

23
00:01:35,068 --> 00:01:42,139
all results in adding business value…, and I can prove it.

24
00:01:42,139 --> 00:01:45,831
That is you can connect the dots between your activities and actual

25
00:01:45,831 --> 00:01:50,139
business requirements meeting the needs of the business.

26
00:01:50,139 --> 00:01:50,939
And if not,

27
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:55,139
you must inspect what you are doing and adapt so that your team or

28
00:01:55,139 --> 00:02:00,139
organization is in fact focused on always adding business value.

29
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:11,000
Now it won't be 100% all the time, but I would always strive for 90% plus in your daily activities.
