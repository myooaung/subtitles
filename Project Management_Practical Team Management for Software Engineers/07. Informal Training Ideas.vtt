00:00:01.326 --> 00:00:02.864
Here are a few easy,

2
00:00:02.864 --> 00:00:10.326
low cost ways to provide training to quickly beef up your team's skills.

3
00:00:10.326 --> 00:00:12.634
The first is lunch and learns.

4
00:00:12.634 --> 00:00:15.326
I have been doing these for years.

5
00:00:15.326 --> 00:00:20.326
Lunch and learns are informal training experiences for you and with your team.

6
00:00:20.326 --> 00:00:23.126
We try and have a lunch and learn about once a month so we

7
00:00:23.126 --> 00:00:26.403
require everyone to give one or two per year.

8
00:00:26.403 --> 00:00:30.826
Sometimes I suggest a topic based on trends in the industry

9
00:00:30.826 --> 00:00:35.326
or features on a current assignment or we're just open for

10
00:00:35.326 --> 00:00:37.326
ideas from the team members.

11
00:00:37.326 --> 00:00:39.459
They are held during lunch time, of course,

12
00:00:39.459 --> 00:00:42.993
at my company we cater a simple lunch and we hold it

13
00:00:42.993 --> 00:00:45.326
for about 60 to maybe 90 minutes.

14
00:00:45.326 --> 00:00:46.659
The lunch, of course,

15
00:00:46.659 --> 00:00:51.417
is a great way to entice people to come and also you are not

16
00:00:51.417 --> 00:00:54.326
impacting their work day very much as well.

17
00:00:54.326 --> 00:00:57.755
If you hold an informal training activity say at 2:00 PM then

18
00:00:57.755 --> 00:01:00.469
work stops or not everyone can make it.

19
00:01:00.469 --> 00:01:03.859
Also, if you are in the consulting business revenue stops.

20
00:01:03.859 --> 00:01:07.326
So we like using the lunch time and if it's a little longer,

21
00:01:07.326 --> 00:01:10.326
maybe about a half an hour more than a normal lunch hour.

22
00:01:10.326 --> 00:01:15.326
Next the lunch and learn is led and presented by a team member,

23
00:01:15.326 --> 00:01:16.417
probably not yourself.

24
00:01:16.417 --> 00:01:20.576
The team member assigned will develop an agenda and I will review it

25
00:01:20.576 --> 00:01:23.326
and comment on it to be sure it'll be a success,

26
00:01:23.326 --> 00:01:26.326
in this case you'll review it and make sure it works for you as well.

27
00:01:26.326 --> 00:01:29.326
Then they create maybe a few PowerPoint slides and

28
00:01:29.326 --> 00:01:30.690
conduct the technical demonstrations.

29
00:01:30.690 --> 00:01:34.612
Also you can invite people from other teams and help those

30
00:01:34.612 --> 00:01:38.040
other teams start their own lunch and learns that you and your

31
00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:40.599
team members can attend as well.

32
00:01:40.599 --> 00:01:42.417
And lastly, another benefit,

33
00:01:42.417 --> 00:01:46.599
the presenter may not realize this but they are learning or

34
00:01:46.599 --> 00:01:49.612
enhancing their presentation skills in planning,

35
00:01:49.612 --> 00:01:51.326
preparing, and presenting.

36
00:01:51.326 --> 00:01:54.711
I like that a lot since good presentation skills is a

37
00:01:54.711 --> 00:01:56.326
key component to career growth.

38
00:01:56.326 --> 00:01:59.326
If you want to learn more about communication and

39
00:01:59.326 --> 00:02:01.326
presentation skills for technical people,

40
00:02:01.326 --> 00:02:05.993
please check out some of my other courses called Leadership and

41
00:02:05.993 --> 00:02:11.326
Presentation Skills for Software Engineers.

42
00:02:11.326 --> 00:02:15.326
Another informal learning experience is what I call dinner and develop

43
00:02:15.326 --> 00:02:19.326
and in this scenario we have real work to get done.

44
00:02:19.326 --> 00:02:23.326
But the type of work may be new to the team or the team is still a bit green,

45
00:02:23.326 --> 00:02:27.326
so they will need some additional training and coaching or mentoring.

46
00:02:27.326 --> 00:02:32.326
Learning as a team is very effective and can be fun too.

47
00:02:32.326 --> 00:02:35.326
So the idea is to get everyone together in the conference physically,

48
00:02:35.326 --> 00:02:35.826
or virtually,

49
00:02:35.826 --> 00:02:38.826
and provide some task assignments that we're going to do concurrently.

50
00:02:38.826 --> 00:02:43.770
So basically it's like on the job training experience in

51
00:02:43.770 --> 00:02:47.326
action together as a team in real time.

52
00:02:47.326 --> 00:02:52.326
So we start about 4:00 PM and go about maybe until 7:00 PM.

53
00:02:52.326 --> 00:02:53.755
Dinner arrives about 5:00 PM.

54
00:02:53.755 --> 00:02:58.112
So we are asking the members to give up some personal time in exchange

55
00:02:58.112 --> 00:03:01.326
for some good food and a fun learning experience.

56
00:03:01.326 --> 00:03:06.326
This is typically led or facilitated by the manager or lead role this time,

57
00:03:06.326 --> 00:03:08.576
this person sets up the dinner and develop event,

58
00:03:08.576 --> 00:03:10.690
provides an assignment to each person,

59
00:03:10.690 --> 00:03:14.326
and we all work on the assignments concurrently.

60
00:03:14.326 --> 00:03:16.576
We like to start it with a whiteboard session

61
00:03:16.576 --> 00:03:18.249
emphasizing the outcome of the event, lastly,

62
00:03:18.249 --> 00:03:20.755
when over each person may still have their own assignment,

63
00:03:20.755 --> 00:03:22.469
not quite done yet,

64
00:03:22.469 --> 00:03:27.249
and they may work on it the next day or they are given some more

65
00:03:27.249 --> 00:03:28.326
assignments to continue in the following days.

66
00:03:28.326 --> 00:03:31.620
This is real handy on the job training,

67
00:03:31.620 --> 00:03:38.826
done in a kind of a team collegiate way and can be very effective as well.

68
00:03:38.826 --> 00:03:41.326
We enjoy this very much.

69
00:03:41.326 --> 00:03:43.864
Sometimes free vendor events is a way to get some quick

70
00:03:43.864 --> 00:03:46.469
insights into new technologies usually at no cost.

71
00:03:46.469 --> 00:03:51.326
In this way we can learn new products and services that you may be

72
00:03:51.326 --> 00:03:54.215
thinking about procuring or just learning about them.

73
00:03:54.215 --> 00:03:57.326
Vendors are always having free promotional events,

74
00:03:57.326 --> 00:04:00.326
either at their offices or virtually online.

75
00:04:00.326 --> 00:04:01.993
Now they are, of course,

76
00:04:01.993 --> 00:04:04.634
vendor centric since they wouldn't talk about other

77
00:04:04.634 --> 00:04:06.480
products that might compete with them,

78
00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:11.326
but many times they give you a description of the landscape of their area of

79
00:04:11.326 --> 00:04:14.659
expertise and how their products best fit into that market.

80
00:04:14.659 --> 00:04:17.226
Now who should you send to the event?

81
00:04:17.226 --> 00:04:19.326
Okay, not the whole team of course.

82
00:04:19.326 --> 00:04:23.659
Maybe it is just you the manager or just one person that has an interest or

83
00:04:23.659 --> 00:04:27.326
maybe a project coming up that this would make sense for.

84
00:04:27.326 --> 00:04:28.711
Whoever attends though,

85
00:04:28.711 --> 00:04:33.326
they must provide a short written email to the team

86
00:04:33.326 --> 00:04:35.993
with the following: the topic, the vendor name,

87
00:04:35.993 --> 00:04:39.659
the reason they attended and how it might relate to the

88
00:04:39.659 --> 00:04:43.249
business and any potential outcomes of that event and any

89
00:04:43.249 --> 00:04:46.326
action items that might relate to your team.

90
00:04:46.326 --> 00:04:47.326
We like these events,

91
00:04:47.326 --> 00:04:50.480
but choose sparingly and carefully so you don't waste anyone's time.

92
00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:53.557
And if it's a really good vendor event,

93
00:04:53.557 --> 00:04:58.018
then we make this topic a lunch and learn where the person who attended

94
00:04:58.018 --> 00:05:02.634
the vendor event comes into the lunch and learn and walks them through the

95
00:05:02.634 --> 00:05:06.326
product or services and what they've learned and how they can contribute

96
00:05:06.326 --> 00:05:10.326
to the team or to your customers.

97
00:05:10.326 --> 00:05:13.788
You can grow your team member's skills and capabilities

98
00:05:13.788 --> 00:05:15.659
through on the job opportunities.

99
00:05:15.659 --> 00:05:16.993
Okay let's see how.

100
00:05:16.993 --> 00:05:21.172
If you know that you want someone on your team to

101
00:05:21.172 --> 00:05:24.403
learn more about say data modeling, design,

102
00:05:24.403 --> 00:05:25.326
and architecture,

103
00:05:25.326 --> 00:05:27.726
then assign tasks to them to give them the opportunity to actually

104
00:05:27.726 --> 00:05:30.659
do the work they need or want to learn about.

105
00:05:30.659 --> 00:05:35.469
If possible I try and make them smaller or more manageable tasks, of course.

106
00:05:35.469 --> 00:05:39.612
Sometimes I let them just go for it, but usually I provide a mentor.

107
00:05:39.612 --> 00:05:42.962
That is usually the lead of the overall activity or project.

108
00:05:42.962 --> 00:05:47.326
This lead may have the experience that's necessary

109
00:05:47.326 --> 00:05:48.826
so that they can in fact mentor,

110
00:05:48.826 --> 00:05:52.599
guide and coach that person so they can maximize their learning experience.

111
00:05:52.599 --> 00:05:53.053
Again,

112
00:05:53.053 --> 00:05:57.788
not only does the person learn new things and then you get to

113
00:05:57.788 --> 00:06:00.826
provide task assignments for them to learn on,

114
00:06:00.826 --> 00:06:03.826
but also this approach builds confidence,

115
00:06:03.826 --> 00:06:06.690
confidence is a huge productivity enhancer.

116
00:06:06.690 --> 00:06:12.144
So if possible assign a task as quickly as possible after any

117
00:06:12.144 --> 00:06:15.326
formal or informal training has been completed.

118
00:06:15.326 --> 00:06:18.326
The longer you wait to do this, the more they will tend to forget.

119
00:06:18.326 --> 00:06:19.480
That's just normal and human.

120
00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:19.941
And lastly,

121
00:06:19.941 --> 00:06:22.755
they also may want to do something new that may be

122
00:06:22.755 --> 00:06:25.326
too much of a stretch for them, if so,

123
00:06:25.326 --> 00:06:29.897
break the assignment or learn experience into much smaller pieces and give

124
00:06:29.897 --> 00:06:33.326
them a strong lead or mentor and then just go for it.

125
00:06:33.326 --> 00:06:38.326
So in this section we've covered some great simple informal training ideas,

126
00:06:38.326 --> 00:06:42.326
lunch and learns, dinner and develop, vendor events,

127
00:06:42.326 --> 00:06:45.826
and lastly improving capabilities through actual

128
00:06:45.826 --> 00:06:53.000
task assignments and opportunities. All four of these work very well and hand in hand.
