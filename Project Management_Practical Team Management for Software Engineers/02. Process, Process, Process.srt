1
00:00:01,113 --> 00:00:05,113
Process, process, process, don't leave home without it.

2
00:00:05,113 --> 00:00:08,113
If you haven't guessed it yet, I'm a process guy.

3
00:00:08,113 --> 00:00:12,113
Remember from the first module, I mentioned I work for an aerospace company,

4
00:00:12,113 --> 00:00:15,113
well jets do not take off unless you follow a process.

5
00:00:15,113 --> 00:00:18,046
I hope on your next flight when the jet takes off,

6
00:00:18,046 --> 00:00:23,113
you remember my course and thank the people that followed a good process.

7
00:00:23,113 --> 00:00:27,113
Okay, now here are a couple definitions.

8
00:00:27,113 --> 00:00:32,113
I keep using the word process, but let's make sure we all know what it is.

9
00:00:32,113 --> 00:00:36,042
A process is a series of actions or steps taken in

10
00:00:36,042 --> 00:00:38,204
order to achieve a particular end.

11
00:00:38,204 --> 00:00:45,113
You will have several processes that are required to run your team.

12
00:00:45,113 --> 00:00:49,113
Now let's extend that definition to a business process.

13
00:00:49,113 --> 00:00:52,959
These are designed to add value for the customer and

14
00:00:52,959 --> 00:00:55,022
should not include unnecessary activities.

15
00:00:55,022 --> 00:00:59,113
So what is the outcome of a good process?

16
00:00:59,113 --> 00:01:03,113
Let's see.

17
00:01:03,113 --> 00:01:07,780
The outcomes of a well designed business process is increased effectiveness,

18
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:13,113
that's value for the customer, and increased efficiency,

19
00:01:13,113 --> 00:01:16,113
less use of resources, money, time, et cetera.

20
00:01:16,113 --> 00:01:21,113
So keep this in mind when you are designing and using your processes.

21
00:01:21,113 --> 00:01:29,000
You want the results of those processes to increase effectiveness and increase the efficiencies.
