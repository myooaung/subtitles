00:00:01.805 --> 00:00:08.805
This section will discuss service level agreements or SLAs and I will define,

2
00:00:08.805 --> 00:00:13.805
illustrate the benefits of using SLAs, and give you detailed examples.

3
00:00:13.805 --> 00:00:16.532
Someday you might find yourself searching for another approach to

4
00:00:16.532 --> 00:00:19.805
tool to better manage your customer's expectations,

5
00:00:19.805 --> 00:00:22.805
or looking at it another way,

6
00:00:22.805 --> 00:00:27.205
where you are the customer trying to manage the deliverables of a vendor or

7
00:00:27.205 --> 00:00:30.805
consulting company providing services to you and your team.

8
00:00:30.805 --> 00:00:36.805
Either way, there are two purposes here where SLAs can help you.

9
00:00:36.805 --> 00:00:38.519
Service Level Agreements.

10
00:00:38.519 --> 00:00:40.805
Alright, here's the definition.

11
00:00:40.805 --> 00:00:43.091
A Service Level Agreement, as I call SLA,

12
00:00:43.091 --> 00:00:46.805
is a contract between a service provider and the customer.

13
00:00:46.805 --> 00:00:51.959
Now the service provider may either be internal in a company,

14
00:00:51.959 --> 00:00:55.036
like your team providing services to a customer,

15
00:00:55.036 --> 00:01:00.805
or external, like a consulting company providing services say to you.

16
00:01:00.805 --> 00:01:04.388
Typically you and your customer define the level of service expected jointly,

17
00:01:04.388 --> 00:01:10.805
maybe in a form of meetings and a written SLA agreement,

18
00:01:10.805 --> 00:01:12.138
yes a formal document.

19
00:01:12.138 --> 00:01:16.441
SLAs are output based in that their purpose is specifically to

20
00:01:16.441 --> 00:01:20.805
define what the customer will receive from you.

21
00:01:20.805 --> 00:01:24.805
Now let's see the benefits of using SLAs.

22
00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:27.305
The reason to have a Service Level Agreement is to

23
00:01:27.305 --> 00:01:29.948
ensure everyone will be on the same page,

24
00:01:29.948 --> 00:01:32.805
which means we all have the same expectations.

25
00:01:32.805 --> 00:01:36.805
So if you have the same understanding of the expectations as your customer,

26
00:01:36.805 --> 00:01:40.805
it will just be easier to manage those expectations.

27
00:01:40.805 --> 00:01:46.805
Okay, expectations in an SLA are specific, not fuzzy.

28
00:01:46.805 --> 00:01:51.805
Though the exact metrics for each SLA vary depending on the service provider,

29
00:01:51.805 --> 00:01:58.805
you, the areas covered may be things like volume or quality of work,

30
00:01:58.805 --> 00:02:00.948
including precision and accuracy, speed,

31
00:02:00.948 --> 00:02:03.055
responsiveness, efficiency, things like that,

32
00:02:03.055 --> 00:02:06.805
in covering these areas the document aims to establish

33
00:02:06.805 --> 00:02:12.930
a mutual understanding of services, areas prioritized,

34
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:17.805
responsibilities, roles, guarantees, warranties and things like that.

35
00:02:17.805 --> 00:02:19.987
Expectations are in writing.

36
00:02:19.987 --> 00:02:25.728
SLAs by definition must be written down and they live in a

37
00:02:25.728 --> 00:02:28.805
formal document that says SLA at the top.

38
00:02:28.805 --> 00:02:31.376
So this isn't just an email stating some criteria,

39
00:02:31.376 --> 00:02:36.972
but in fact a document listing out all the services and metrics to be managed,

40
00:02:36.972 --> 00:02:41.623
monitored, and delivered to the customer by you.

41
00:02:41.623 --> 00:02:44.805
Also, expectations can be measured.

42
00:02:44.805 --> 00:02:48.805
The level of service should be specific and measurable in each area.

43
00:02:48.805 --> 00:02:53.694
This allows the quality of service to be benchmarked and if covered by the

44
00:02:53.694 --> 00:02:56.805
agreement rewarded or maybe even penalized accordingly.

45
00:02:56.805 --> 00:03:02.805
An SLA will calmly use technical definitions that qualify the level of service,

46
00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:06.805
such as maybe mean time between failures or meantime to recovery,

47
00:03:06.805 --> 00:03:08.605
response times, resolution,

48
00:03:08.605 --> 00:03:14.472
which specifies a target or average or minimum value

49
00:03:14.472 --> 00:03:17.805
for service level performance.

50
00:03:17.805 --> 00:03:18.405
For example,

51
00:03:18.405 --> 00:03:22.405
SLAs are also very popular among internal departments and larger organizations.

52
00:03:22.405 --> 00:03:29.694
The use of an SLA by an IT help desk with other departments allows

53
00:03:29.694 --> 00:03:32.805
their performance to be defined and benchmarked.

54
00:03:32.805 --> 00:03:35.805
For example, how many calls by week are coming in?

55
00:03:35.805 --> 00:03:38.605
How many are resolved within 1 hour?

56
00:03:38.605 --> 00:03:39.805
Within 1 day?

57
00:03:39.805 --> 00:03:40.662
Within 1 week?

58
00:03:40.662 --> 00:03:41.805
And things like that.

59
00:03:41.805 --> 00:03:46.532
The use of SLAs is also common in outsourcing or cloud computing

60
00:03:46.532 --> 00:03:52.027
and other areas where the responsibility of an organization is

61
00:03:52.027 --> 00:03:54.805
transferred out to another supplier.

62
00:03:54.805 --> 00:03:59.805
Okay, so again, they can be used internally between you and your customers,

63
00:03:59.805 --> 00:04:03.078
or they could be used externally where you're getting

64
00:04:03.078 --> 00:04:05.948
services provided from the outside to you.

65
00:04:05.948 --> 00:04:16.000
Okay now let's deconstruct an SLA and then later go into an example that might relate to you and your new team.
