00:00:00.419 --> 00:00:01.146
Project management.

2
00:00:01.146 --> 00:00:05.919
We talked in an earlier section about the difference between a project,

3
00:00:05.919 --> 00:00:09.419
a bug or a planned application maintenance.

4
00:00:09.419 --> 00:00:13.055
In this section we'll focus on larger activities that warrant

5
00:00:13.055 --> 00:00:18.419
focus and attention to be called a project.

6
00:00:18.419 --> 00:00:20.752
Now let's do a couple of definitions.

7
00:00:20.752 --> 00:00:24.086
Project management is the planning and the organization of a

8
00:00:24.086 --> 00:00:26.419
company's resources to move a specific task,

9
00:00:26.419 --> 00:00:30.419
event, service, or product towards completion.

10
00:00:30.419 --> 00:00:38.419
Okay the short version, the process of managing projects.

11
00:00:38.419 --> 00:00:41.881
Now here is a simple definition or a project,

12
00:00:41.881 --> 00:00:47.419
a temporary group activity designed to produce a unique product,

13
00:00:47.419 --> 00:00:49.419
service or result.

14
00:00:49.419 --> 00:00:54.419
Now let's note some key words, temporary implies a start and end date.

15
00:00:54.419 --> 00:00:59.419
Group implies more than one person, usually a team.

16
00:00:59.419 --> 00:01:03.919
And unique, a problem is something special in that it is not a routine operation,

17
00:01:03.919 --> 00:01:10.055
but a specific set of activities designed to accomplish a singular goal.

18
00:01:10.055 --> 00:01:14.419
Okay, let's get into a little more detail.

19
00:01:14.419 --> 00:01:17.086
So when should an activity be a project?

20
00:01:17.086 --> 00:01:18.919
Let's explore some simple guidelines.

21
00:01:18.919 --> 00:01:22.419
Now every company or organization is different,

22
00:01:22.419 --> 00:01:24.169
so figure out what works for you.

23
00:01:24.169 --> 00:01:28.336
Basically, you'll want to place attention and focus on a key activity,

24
00:01:28.336 --> 00:01:30.419
that's why it's a project.

25
00:01:30.419 --> 00:01:33.188
The activity is just too important to have a

26
00:01:33.188 --> 00:01:34.874
developer not only develop software,

27
00:01:34.874 --> 00:01:39.419
but to also worry about a lot of other stuff.

28
00:01:39.419 --> 00:01:41.601
Typically a larger activity of greater complexity will

29
00:01:41.601 --> 00:01:44.133
warrant an activity to be a project.

30
00:01:44.133 --> 00:01:46.276
If things are getting complex,

31
00:01:46.276 --> 00:01:50.019
then placing someone on it to ensure those complexities

32
00:01:50.019 --> 00:01:52.419
are managed or solved or removed.

33
00:01:52.419 --> 00:01:55.188
When you need someone to look over it and ensure the milestones,

34
00:01:55.188 --> 00:01:58.419
budgets, and schedules are met and a customer is happy.

35
00:01:58.419 --> 00:02:00.641
Again, milestones, budgets, and schedules,

36
00:02:00.641 --> 00:02:02.919
these aren't software engineering tasks,

37
00:02:02.919 --> 00:02:05.419
these are project management tasks.

38
00:02:05.419 --> 00:02:09.086
And a great coupling is great software engineers with a great

39
00:02:09.086 --> 00:02:12.601
project manager and boy you have a win/win.

40
00:02:12.601 --> 00:02:14.419
Now sometimes size matters.

41
00:02:14.419 --> 00:02:17.836
A very large activity would warrant a person to provide the necessary oversight.

42
00:02:17.836 --> 00:02:21.586
In one of my client's organizations an activity over

43
00:02:21.586 --> 00:02:26.419
40 hours was consider a project, in others it was over 200 hours.

44
00:02:26.419 --> 00:02:30.419
So you decide what makes sense for you in your organization.

45
00:02:30.419 --> 00:02:30.804
Financial,

46
00:02:30.804 --> 00:02:36.219
in other companies it maybe the dollar size or impact to revenue or impact

47
00:02:36.219 --> 00:02:39.419
to operating expenses that makes something a project.

48
00:02:39.419 --> 00:02:40.848
This is good as well.

49
00:02:40.848 --> 00:02:42.848
Now an activity may also be political,

50
00:02:42.848 --> 00:02:45.419
that you better have someone overseeing it at all times.

51
00:02:45.419 --> 00:02:50.419
The activity may not be that important to the company or that big,

52
00:02:50.419 --> 00:02:54.419
but the user just so happens to be the CEO,

53
00:02:54.419 --> 00:02:56.419
so you get my drift.

54
00:02:56.419 --> 00:03:00.419
Now you don't need one project manager for every project necessarily.

55
00:03:00.419 --> 00:03:02.705
In our scenario of your five person team,

56
00:03:02.705 --> 00:03:06.752
maybe one person has the PM or project management skills and spends part

57
00:03:06.752 --> 00:03:09.619
or full-time on the function of project management,

58
00:03:09.619 --> 00:03:13.276
and would in fact manage multiple projects of various sizes.

59
00:03:13.276 --> 00:03:16.419
And maybe you spend some of your time as the manager

60
00:03:16.419 --> 00:03:19.301
running a project or two as well.

61
00:03:19.301 --> 00:03:23.419
Now let's check out the roles of a project manager.

62
00:03:23.419 --> 00:03:26.419
So what does a project manager actually do?

63
00:03:26.419 --> 00:03:29.086
What are the rules they need to perform?

64
00:03:29.086 --> 00:03:30.419
Okay, here's a few.

65
00:03:30.419 --> 00:03:34.419
They need to create clear and attainable project objectives.

66
00:03:34.419 --> 00:03:39.419
They need to be the central point of contact for all project communication.

67
00:03:39.419 --> 00:03:41.957
They're going to probably wear many hats and juggle many balls,

68
00:03:41.957 --> 00:03:44.752
so they need to be skilled in many areas.

69
00:03:44.752 --> 00:03:46.819
They're also responsible for the planning,

70
00:03:46.819 --> 00:03:51.086
the control, the execution and ultimately the closing of any project.

71
00:03:51.086 --> 00:03:53.419
That is a lot of potential work.

72
00:03:53.419 --> 00:03:57.819
Also they need to be a champion of the project and a change agent since

73
00:03:57.819 --> 00:04:02.752
projects are generally bigger or chunkier pieces of work and since they

74
00:04:02.752 --> 00:04:05.419
also have more significant political, financial,

75
00:04:05.419 --> 00:04:08.752
and business impacts, that is really big change,

76
00:04:08.752 --> 00:04:12.819
it is important for the PM to be a champion of that change.

77
00:04:12.819 --> 00:04:16.237
Now here are a few more responsibilities I would like

78
00:04:16.237 --> 00:04:19.419
to talk about on the next slide.

79
00:04:19.419 --> 00:04:23.419
Here are a few more roles or responsibilities of a project manager.

80
00:04:23.419 --> 00:04:27.419
They're responsible for accomplishing the stated project objectives.

81
00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:30.863
On the previous slide, they are responsible for creating the project objectives,

82
00:04:30.863 --> 00:04:35.086
but they also are responsible for actually accomplishing those objectives.

83
00:04:35.086 --> 00:04:38.219
Responsible for project requirements of the customer or client.

84
00:04:38.219 --> 00:04:42.237
It's very important to get those requirements correct and we're talked

85
00:04:42.237 --> 00:04:45.119
throughout this module about the importance of quality requirements.

86
00:04:45.119 --> 00:04:52.146
Responsible for bridging the gap between the project team and the

87
00:04:52.146 --> 00:04:55.419
client or customer and the technical team as well.

88
00:04:55.419 --> 00:05:00.086
So having great communication and leadership skills is essential for a good PM.

89
00:05:00.086 --> 00:05:04.133
Also managing the constraints of cost, time, scope, and quality.

90
00:05:04.133 --> 00:05:08.752
Now that is a challenge since we all know the scope seems to

91
00:05:08.752 --> 00:05:11.086
always grow and the time gets shorter.

92
00:05:11.086 --> 00:05:13.783
Perform issue and risk identification and remediation.

93
00:05:13.783 --> 00:05:17.975
Stuff will always go wrong and must be identified,

94
00:05:17.975 --> 00:05:23.197
tracked, reported out to management and customers and remediated,

95
00:05:23.197 --> 00:05:25.530
that is fixed.

96
00:05:25.530 --> 00:05:29.419
Okay, here's an interesting quote.

97
00:05:29.419 --> 00:05:34.419
As a PM you'll be doing a lot of planning, so here's a great quote.

98
00:05:34.419 --> 00:05:38.919
"Plans are of little importance, but planning is essential,

99
00:05:38.919 --> 00:05:41.919
" by one of my favs Winston Churchill.

100
00:05:41.919 --> 00:05:47.601
So I would like to read it as this, plans are of little importance,

101
00:05:47.601 --> 00:05:49.752
but planning is absolutely essential.

102
00:05:49.752 --> 00:05:54.783
The point is that the planning process that you will do with your customers,

103
00:05:54.783 --> 00:05:56.146
users, team members,

104
00:05:56.146 --> 00:05:59.919
and other subject matter experts is actually more

105
00:05:59.919 --> 00:06:02.419
important than the plans themselves.

106
00:06:02.419 --> 00:06:05.419
Okay, have I piqued your interest in project management?

107
00:06:05.419 --> 00:06:10.419
Let's see where you can learn more about project management.

108
00:06:10.419 --> 00:06:14.419
As I mentioned each section in this module could in fact be a complete course.

109
00:06:14.419 --> 00:06:18.133
Well I would like to recommend to you another one of my Pluralsight

110
00:06:18.133 --> 00:06:20.219
courses titled Project Management for Software Engineers,

111
00:06:20.219 --> 00:06:29.000
which is a nice adjunct or companion course for this course. Now I'd like to make a quick comment on Agile.
