1
00:00:00,992 --> 00:00:05,849
Yes, you need to write status reports and you may need to write several per week.

2
00:00:05,849 --> 00:00:08,992
Now maybe your team will author some of those for you,

3
00:00:08,992 --> 00:00:11,992
but you'll still need to review and send out yourself.

4
00:00:11,992 --> 00:00:13,992
So to whom do you send your status reports?

5
00:00:13,992 --> 00:00:19,992
Well for me there are three main types of status report recipients.

6
00:00:19,992 --> 00:00:23,430
Now they are across to your customer, up to your manager,

7
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:26,069
and down to your team as follows.

8
00:00:26,069 --> 00:00:28,223
So first your customers,

9
00:00:28,223 --> 00:00:34,901
now the lack of a status report is usually interpreted by a customer as either,

10
00:00:34,901 --> 00:00:38,278
hmm something's wrong or you don't know what is going on.

11
00:00:38,278 --> 00:00:40,825
You do not what that impression of you.

12
00:00:40,825 --> 00:00:43,325
In fact, your consistent status reports,

13
00:00:43,325 --> 00:00:46,447
following the 5 C's, will support a positive,

14
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:50,792
professional perception of you and your team by your customers.

15
00:00:50,792 --> 00:00:56,242
So consistent statusing your customers is important, never miss one.

16
00:00:56,242 --> 00:00:59,159
So whatever the cadence is, for example,

17
00:00:59,159 --> 00:01:02,659
every week on Wednesday or maybe every week on Friday

18
00:01:02,659 --> 00:01:06,192
or maybe the first of the month, figure out what that cadence is,

19
00:01:06,192 --> 00:01:09,192
get the bio from the customer to make sure they're okay with that,

20
00:01:09,192 --> 00:01:10,992
and then never miss a one.

21
00:01:10,992 --> 00:01:12,492
What you want, this will sound silly,

22
00:01:12,492 --> 00:01:16,125
but you want is for your customer to see the status report come in and

23
00:01:16,125 --> 00:01:18,592
then just delete it because they know it's regular,

24
00:01:18,592 --> 00:01:22,659
they know it's consistent, they know it's professional and they trust you.

25
00:01:22,659 --> 00:01:25,992
Alright, you want to also status your management.

26
00:01:25,992 --> 00:01:26,719
Be consistent.

27
00:01:26,719 --> 00:01:30,659
I suggest copying your management also on your other status reports

28
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:32,992
that are going through customers or stakeholders.

29
00:01:32,992 --> 00:01:35,192
He will also see the progress and quality of your work

30
00:01:35,192 --> 00:01:37,492
as well as your customer's will too.

31
00:01:37,492 --> 00:01:41,992
And you also want, of course, status your team.

32
00:01:41,992 --> 00:01:46,607
Now statusing your team may be on the informal side as well,

33
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,223
quick little emails or whatever,

34
00:01:48,223 --> 00:01:52,325
but on the formal side it might be company policy that comes down,

35
00:01:52,325 --> 00:01:54,325
HR related things that come down,

36
00:01:54,325 --> 00:01:57,992
here's the schedule for the performance reviews and things like that.

37
00:01:57,992 --> 00:02:01,265
So you'll want to follow the formal structure because this is a formal and

38
00:02:01,265 --> 00:02:03,992
professional email that you'll want to send to your team.

39
00:02:03,992 --> 00:02:11,992
Alright, let's talk a little bit more about the structure of a status report.

40
00:02:11,992 --> 00:02:13,607
Whenever you are writing a status report,

41
00:02:13,607 --> 00:02:15,356
always answer at least one key question.

42
00:02:15,356 --> 00:02:18,992
In other words, where is the project or activity now?

43
00:02:18,992 --> 00:02:21,992
Because that is what your customer or management will be looking for.

44
00:02:21,992 --> 00:02:25,992
Just where are we right now, where are we going, what are the issues?

45
00:02:25,992 --> 00:02:30,278
Okay so to answer that, we must look at both the past,

46
00:02:30,278 --> 00:02:30,992
the present,

47
00:02:30,992 --> 00:02:33,761
and the future because any status report is built

48
00:02:33,761 --> 00:02:35,706
with the following three categories.

49
00:02:35,706 --> 00:02:39,992
Okay, what's been done or progressed?

50
00:02:39,992 --> 00:02:43,992
You're looking at the past, what has been achieved to this point?

51
00:02:43,992 --> 00:02:48,992
What is left to do or what are the plans, what's in the future?

52
00:02:48,992 --> 00:02:51,992
What are our goals or objectives and plans yet to do?

53
00:02:51,992 --> 00:02:54,659
And then are there any issues or problems?

54
00:02:54,659 --> 00:02:56,492
What challenges have been encountered?

55
00:02:56,492 --> 00:03:02,223
Items that are stuck or can't be finished sometimes are known as blockers.

56
00:03:02,223 --> 00:03:05,915
Problems to issues often need help from someone else or other organizations.

57
00:03:05,915 --> 00:03:08,992
Those should be noted in the status report as well.

58
00:03:08,992 --> 00:03:14,992
Okay I call progress, plans, and problems, Michael's 3 P's.

59
00:03:14,992 --> 00:03:18,992
That's the basis for the simplest and most common status report

60
00:03:18,992 --> 00:03:21,992
on which all variations I think are based on.

61
00:03:21,992 --> 00:03:23,992
You could also look at these three sections a little differently,

62
00:03:23,992 --> 00:03:26,792
what's done, what's to do, open issues.

63
00:03:26,792 --> 00:03:27,992
It's the same.

64
00:03:27,992 --> 00:03:32,992
So you can always add additional categories to progress, plans and problems.

65
00:03:32,992 --> 00:03:35,174
And in software development you could just list

66
00:03:35,174 --> 00:03:37,325
things like proposed feature ideas, ala scrum,

67
00:03:37,325 --> 00:03:41,242
additional backlog ideas, you could add an area for customer feedback,

68
00:03:41,242 --> 00:03:44,992
you can add an area for logistics, for example,

69
00:03:44,992 --> 00:03:47,575
we're going to be out of town one week and we're changing the meeting locations,

70
00:03:47,575 --> 00:03:51,075
so you can add other categories,

71
00:03:51,075 --> 00:03:57,325
but the three core categories you should always include in the status report,

72
00:03:57,325 --> 00:03:58,992
progress, plans, and problems.

73
00:03:58,992 --> 00:04:02,992
Okay, so what do you think about this module so far?

74
00:04:02,992 --> 00:04:09,000
Do you have what it takes to be an effective communicator? Let's see.
