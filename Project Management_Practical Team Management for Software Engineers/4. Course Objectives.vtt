00:00:01.713 --> 00:00:06.713
Because there's no widely agreed on skill set for management practices in IT,

2
00:00:06.713 --> 00:00:10.713
I mean good managers come in all shapes and sizes certainly.

3
00:00:10.713 --> 00:00:12.713
There's an assumption everyone knows how to do it.

4
00:00:12.713 --> 00:00:15.713
My boss's boss's boss thought so apparently.

5
00:00:15.713 --> 00:00:18.380
But this would be like giving my daughter,

6
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:21.856
who's never driven before, keys to a car and told,

7
00:00:21.856 --> 00:00:22.570
well drive.

8
00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:26.478
So to help mitigate the challenges you may have and to

9
00:00:26.478 --> 00:00:30.713
save you time from trial and error, this class is for you.

10
00:00:30.713 --> 00:00:33.213
So here are the objectives of this course: Learn or

11
00:00:33.213 --> 00:00:37.213

12
