1
00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:05,800
Now let's define the requirements of the person we want to hire,

2
00:00:05,800 --> 00:00:08,338
and let's also keep in mind the last slide as well,

3
00:00:08,338 --> 00:00:13,800
most people tend to think about just replacing someone almost one for one.

4
00:00:13,800 --> 00:00:17,436
But as we discussed, looking for new skills,

5
00:00:17,436 --> 00:00:24,800
new capabilities, and diversity may help leverage your team to new heights.

6
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,800
Let's always ask the question, why are you hiring?

7
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:30,569
So in order to write a targeted job description,

8
00:00:30,569 --> 00:00:34,877
you need to know exactly why you are hiring and that way you can

9
00:00:34,877 --> 00:00:37,050
write the best requirements for the job opening.

10
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:39,217
When you want to attract the right candidates,

11
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:45,300
you have to begin with a well thought through job description as a starting

12
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:48,800
point in implementing your talent acquisition strategy.

13
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,800
Let's see how we can do this in this section.

14
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:55,800
To begin writing our job requirements,

15
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,527
we need to identify the roles or roles of the position as

16
00:01:00,527 --> 00:01:02,800
well as the associated responsibilities.

17
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,200
Now this should be easy since in the module building team structure and

18
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:11,338
capabilities we identified and documented the roles we needed for our team and

19
00:01:11,338 --> 00:01:14,800
for each role we identified the list of responsibilities.

20
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,262
So in a way this is really easy,

21
00:01:17,262 --> 00:01:21,133
just pull out the documentation of the role or roles to be

22
00:01:21,133 --> 00:01:23,700
fulfilled and their corresponding responsibilities or duties as

23
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:25,800
we defined them in the other module.

24
00:01:25,800 --> 00:01:31,800
Okay, now let's look for any gaps.

25
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:35,200
Now that we have our roles and responsibilities as a starting point based

26
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,800
on the roles and responsibilities of the person leaving,

27
00:01:38,800 --> 00:01:41,657
more than likely, let's look for any gaps,

28
00:01:41,657 --> 00:01:44,164
that is what might we be missing?

29
00:01:44,164 --> 00:01:47,800
Will the new position replace an existing role or roles?

30
00:01:47,800 --> 00:01:53,800
Okay, that's the easy case, we have material and we are ready.

31
00:01:53,800 --> 00:01:57,800
Will the new position add responsibilities that did not exist before?

32
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:00,569
Well then in this case we need to identify and document the

33
00:02:00,569 --> 00:02:03,800
new responsibilities for each role effected.

34
00:02:03,800 --> 00:02:08,467
Next, will the new position change any existing responsibilities?

35
00:02:08,467 --> 00:02:14,022
And in this case we need to identify and document the changing

36
00:02:14,022 --> 00:02:16,800
responsibilities for each role effected.

37
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,800
Will the new position add a new role that did not exist before?

38
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:22,031
Okay,

39
00:02:22,031 --> 00:02:25,300
then we need to identify the role or roles needed and document the

40
00:02:25,300 --> 00:02:28,800
new or changing responsibilities for each role.

41
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,800
You may have noticed that I have stated identify and document.

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,800
There is a reason for it, most managers do not like to document.

43
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:43,800
If you learn anything from this course, you will see we document everything.

44
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,133
That's a best practice and truly will make your life as a new manager much,

45
00:02:50,133 --> 00:02:52,800
much easier.

46
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:56,800
Now let's revisit our skill requirement areas.

47
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,800
So remember in the module on building team structure and capabilities,

48
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:05,300
we identified three areas of skills we need to have a solid and healthy team.

49
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,800
The first is the obvious one, technical.

50
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:12,800
So identify all the technical skills required for the roles and

51
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,800
responsibilities we have identified so far.

52
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:18,467
Next communication skills,

53
00:03:18,467 --> 00:03:23,675
determine the communication skills you think are required for

54
00:03:23,675 --> 00:03:26,800
the roles and responsibilities identified.

55
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,073
Lastly is leadership skills, again,

56
00:03:29,073 --> 00:03:32,723
based on the roles and responsibilities we have identified,

57
00:03:32,723 --> 00:03:35,492
list the leadership skills you think you and your

58
00:03:35,492 --> 00:03:38,624
team will need in the new hire.

59
00:03:38,624 --> 00:03:41,447
Okay, so as you can see,

60
00:03:41,447 --> 00:03:45,133
this is a very straightforward and prescriptive approach

61
00:03:45,133 --> 00:03:47,800
to creating your new hire requirements.

62
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:51,800
Now let's see an example.

63
00:03:51,800 --> 00:03:55,133
Now let's itemize the skills needed in each of the

64
00:03:55,133 --> 00:03:56,800
three areas we just discussed.

65
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:59,262
The first is technical, and in this case,

66
00:03:59,262 --> 00:04:01,400
based on the roles and responsibilities,

67
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,800
we think we need Bootstrap, CSS, Cascading Style Sheets,

68
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:07,633
and jQuery.

69
00:04:07,633 --> 00:04:09,300
Next would be communication.

70
00:04:09,300 --> 00:04:13,000
We think based on the roles and responsibilities we need

71
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:16,800
someone that has some good presentation writing skills and in

72
00:04:16,800 --> 00:04:19,800
that case probably PowerPoint as well.

73
00:04:19,800 --> 00:04:23,514
And lastly would be leadership and in this case we think we need

74
00:04:23,514 --> 00:04:26,255
some project management skills because we see some big projects

75
00:04:26,255 --> 00:04:30,967
coming up and because they're big projects we may also need some

76
00:04:30,967 --> 00:04:35,800
developing estimates, how we can make some good estimates for these projects.

77
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,371
So in this case, of course, this is a short list just to illustrate the process.

78
00:04:40,371 --> 00:04:41,514
But in your case,

79
00:04:41,514 --> 00:04:44,943
you will list all the skills you think are needed in each

80
00:04:44,943 --> 00:04:47,800
of the three areas and there may be, you know,

81
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:50,709
20 technical skills and 4 communication skills and,

82
00:04:50,709 --> 00:04:52,415
you know, 13 leadership skills,

83
00:04:52,415 --> 00:04:55,800
and again we want to have the full list of skills,

84
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,800
as if we're looking for the person that walks on water.

85
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,492
Later we may compromise and hire someone that doesn't have all those

86
00:05:02,492 --> 00:05:06,800
skills because typically people do not walk on water.

87
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,800
Okay, now let's recap.

88
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,800
Now let's go through our requirements checklist and do a quick recap.

89
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:20,300
You have identified the roles, some may have been existing and some may be new.

90
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:24,800
You have identified the responsibilities that may be new

91
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,371
for an existing role or for a new role.

92
00:05:27,371 --> 00:05:29,911
You have identified the core technical skills.

93
00:05:29,911 --> 00:05:33,800
You have identified the key communication skills.

94
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,800
You have identified the desired leadership skills.

95
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:42,800
Now some team input, take the material you have and sit down with your team.

96
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,262
Ask them for their inputs and feedback and be sure you haven't missed anything.

97
00:05:47,262 --> 00:05:52,800
Also, by engaging your team they will feel part of the process,

98
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:56,133
they will feel appreciated and excited about the new hire,

99
00:05:56,133 --> 00:06:01,800
rather than wondering why the person has just left your team.

100
00:06:01,800 --> 00:06:04,108
And lastly, document all of this.

101
00:06:04,108 --> 00:06:08,133
This won't be the first time you'll have to do this process,

102
00:06:08,133 --> 00:06:12,514
keeping your notes for the next time will save you time in the future.

103
00:06:12,514 --> 00:06:14,657
So now you are ready,

104
00:06:14,657 --> 00:06:19,877
you know what you need and now you have to find the person

105
00:06:19,877 --> 00:06:27,000
that will fulfill your requirements. Now let's take a look at the acquisition process in the next section.
