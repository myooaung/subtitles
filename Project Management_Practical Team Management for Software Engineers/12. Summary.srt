1
00:00:01,063 --> 00:00:04,063
Well we have come full circle, we determined we had a need for a new hire,

2
00:00:04,063 --> 00:00:08,063
that is, we needed to acquire new talent and now they have been onboarded.

3
00:00:08,063 --> 00:00:09,206
Great job.

4
00:00:09,206 --> 00:00:12,063
Okay, let's recap this module.

5
00:00:12,063 --> 00:00:13,263
First was retention.

6
00:00:13,263 --> 00:00:16,063
Before you start hiring or replacing people,

7
00:00:16,063 --> 00:00:20,063
take a look inward and determine your retention rate.

8
00:00:20,063 --> 00:00:20,492
That is,

9
00:00:20,492 --> 00:00:23,063
how many people stay working for you over a period of time

10
00:00:23,063 --> 00:00:26,063
compared to the total people working for you?

11
00:00:26,063 --> 00:00:27,239
We had a simple example,

12
00:00:27,239 --> 00:00:31,448
that is if you have 5 people for a 12 month period and 1 leaves,

13
00:00:31,448 --> 00:00:36,063
your retention is 4 divided by 5, which is 80%.

14
00:00:36,063 --> 00:00:37,896
Now actually that sounds kind of bad because you have such a small little group.

15
00:00:37,896 --> 00:00:42,063
So it may be appropriate to prorate that using months.

16
00:00:42,063 --> 00:00:45,140
Also you'll want to look at things that improve retention,

17
00:00:45,140 --> 00:00:47,188
such as recognizing and rewarding people,

18
00:00:47,188 --> 00:00:49,063
offering learning and growth opportunities,

19
00:00:49,063 --> 00:00:52,063
and lastly, don't forget, they don't leave the company,

20
00:00:52,063 --> 00:00:55,463
if they leave they leave typically because of you.

21
00:00:55,463 --> 00:00:57,063
Finding the right talent.

22
00:00:57,063 --> 00:01:03,063
We talked about hiring from not only outside your company, but inside.

23
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:05,063
I suggest always looking inside first,

24
00:01:05,063 --> 00:01:09,881
so you'll want to look how the new hire may add value for

25
00:01:09,881 --> 00:01:14,063
longer range portfolio transitions or new skills you didn't

26
00:01:14,063 --> 00:01:18,063
originally realize maybe of value, or new capabilities,

27
00:01:18,063 --> 00:01:20,972
such a very poised speaker or succession planning,

28
00:01:20,972 --> 00:01:23,396
someone who could potentially replace you,

29
00:01:23,396 --> 00:01:24,730
and lastly diversity,

30
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:29,063
someone with viewpoints that may bring a whole new emphasis to your team.

31
00:01:29,063 --> 00:01:32,063
Then we needed to define the job requirements.

32
00:01:32,063 --> 00:01:35,525
First, we needed to understand why you were hiring,

33
00:01:35,525 --> 00:01:38,678
this will, of course, help if you define the new requirements.

34
00:01:38,678 --> 00:01:41,263
Sure you need to acquire new technical skills or possibly

35
00:01:41,263 --> 00:01:43,063
improve some that you already have,

36
00:01:43,063 --> 00:01:48,063
but you also need to look for leadership skills and communication skills.

37
00:01:48,063 --> 00:01:51,174
People need to write effectively, speak effectively,

38
00:01:51,174 --> 00:01:55,063
and interact effectively to work with your customers and management.

39
00:01:55,063 --> 00:01:59,063
Next we went through the six step acquisition process.

40
00:01:59,063 --> 00:02:02,448
Step 1 was document and post your new hire skill requirements,

41
00:02:02,448 --> 00:02:07,063
step 2 was the screening of those resumes and doing the phone calling,

42
00:02:07,063 --> 00:02:09,601
so you were narrowing down your large pile of resumes to

43
00:02:09,601 --> 00:02:11,777
those that pass your phone interview,

44
00:02:11,777 --> 00:02:16,294
next in step 3 would be the in person interview which

45
00:02:16,294 --> 00:02:17,448
might include a test potentially,

46
00:02:17,448 --> 00:02:20,396
you may also want one or more of your team members

47
00:02:20,396 --> 00:02:22,063
involved in the interview process.

48
00:02:22,063 --> 00:02:27,063
Step 4 was an optional follow on interview or interviews.

49
00:02:27,063 --> 00:02:28,349
Usually one interview is not enough,

50
00:02:28,349 --> 00:02:33,063
you may need to kind of drill in and go deeper with some of those candidates.

51
00:02:33,063 --> 00:02:34,930
In step 5 we had the selection.

52
00:02:34,930 --> 00:02:36,796
Now you pick one that you want,

53
00:02:36,796 --> 00:02:40,501
but you also need to have a backup just in case that

54
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,313
first person does in fact decline.

55
00:02:42,313 --> 00:02:46,396
And step 6, of course, was just the paperwork and getting everything all set up,

56
00:02:46,396 --> 00:02:47,396
usually with HR.

57
00:02:47,396 --> 00:02:49,963
Then we jumped over to preparing your questions.

58
00:02:49,963 --> 00:02:54,463
It is important to prepare your questions ahead of time so you can

59
00:02:54,463 --> 00:02:58,063
pull out the information you need from that person.

60
00:02:58,063 --> 00:02:59,206
Never do it random.

61
00:02:59,206 --> 00:03:04,371
You may also want to test that person or maybe have them write a program or

62
00:03:04,371 --> 00:03:08,263
use a tool to actually literally test their hands on skills.

63
00:03:08,263 --> 00:03:11,313
Remember other questions are very important for critical thinking,

64
00:03:11,313 --> 00:03:16,263
trying to get them to talk and find out whether they have

65
00:03:16,263 --> 00:03:20,063
the right attitude and the right motivation for the kind

66
00:03:20,063 --> 00:03:22,063
of job that you are offering.

67
00:03:22,063 --> 00:03:23,881
And lastly was onboarding.

68
00:03:23,881 --> 00:03:28,881
So we discussed the checklist of activities for that new person.

69
00:03:28,881 --> 00:03:32,063
First we do introduction, then business alignment,

70
00:03:32,063 --> 00:03:35,336
talk to your customers, we then review the structure,

71
00:03:35,336 --> 00:03:35,699
roles,

72
00:03:35,699 --> 00:03:38,790
and responsibilities that the person will perform and also talk about

73
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:44,063
the processes themselves that your team follows.

74
00:03:44,063 --> 00:03:46,920
Then we give them their first one or two assignments,

75
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:49,217
and then we also assign them to a mentor,

76
00:03:49,217 --> 00:03:51,063
which may be yourself, but as I mentioned,

77
00:03:51,063 --> 00:03:55,063
I really prefer you to find a mentor that's one of their coworkers

78
00:03:55,063 --> 00:04:00,063
to start building that relationship between them.

79
00:04:00,063 --> 00:04:00,448
Okay,

80
00:04:00,448 --> 00:04:04,294
in the next module we will learn how important communication

81
00:04:04,294 --> 00:04:10,000
skills are in your new role as a manager. See you there.
