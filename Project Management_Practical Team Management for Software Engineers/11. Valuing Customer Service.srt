1
00:00:01,529 --> 00:00:03,165
Valuing customer service.

2
00:00:03,165 --> 00:00:08,029
So what do your customers think about your service?

3
00:00:08,029 --> 00:00:10,529
Pretty good, I hope so.

4
00:00:10,529 --> 00:00:12,529
Can you quantify it?

5
00:00:12,529 --> 00:00:13,862
Can you measure it?

6
00:00:13,862 --> 00:00:17,074
Can issues with customer service affect a customer's expectation?

7
00:00:17,074 --> 00:00:17,620
Absolutely.

8
00:00:17,620 --> 00:00:23,620
For example, I go into a restaurant and order my favorite hamburger.

9
00:00:23,620 --> 00:00:28,929
It meets my expectations once again, but the table service was not very good.

10
00:00:28,929 --> 00:00:32,529
He was just never around when I needed him,

11
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:36,529
so my overall expectations were not met even though the burger was great.

12
00:00:36,529 --> 00:00:41,529
So just making great burgers, or writing great software, may not be enough.

13
00:00:41,529 --> 00:00:44,802
Remember your project manager did not provide very good

14
00:00:44,802 --> 00:00:47,529
service while running the project, yet the software was perfect.

15
00:00:47,529 --> 00:00:48,279
Guess what?

16
00:00:48,279 --> 00:00:50,529
The customer's expectations were not met.

17
00:00:50,529 --> 00:00:54,529
So let's explore further.

18
00:00:54,529 --> 00:00:58,529
Here's an approach to determining the quality of your customer service.

19
00:00:58,529 --> 00:00:58,779
Okay,

20
00:00:58,779 --> 00:01:01,529
to get a really good handle on your customer service levels

21
00:01:01,529 --> 00:01:05,529
you must go out and talk to your customers.

22
00:01:05,529 --> 00:01:07,375
Okay so who are your customers?

23
00:01:07,375 --> 00:01:11,375
I would talk to management and users or anyone that touches all or

24
00:01:11,375 --> 00:01:14,386
part of the systems that you provide support for.

25
00:01:14,386 --> 00:01:16,529
Also determine your service offerings.

26
00:01:16,529 --> 00:01:18,837
What is it that you do?

27
00:01:18,837 --> 00:01:22,893
Maybe call these your service badges or synonymously service offerings.

28
00:01:22,893 --> 00:01:23,802
For example,

29
00:01:23,802 --> 00:01:28,129
your call center is a service offering or what I'm

30
00:01:28,129 --> 00:01:30,529
going to call a service badge.

31
00:01:30,529 --> 00:01:33,196
And for each one of your key customers,

32
00:01:33,196 --> 00:01:36,452
and make them as senior as you can possibly be,

33
00:01:36,452 --> 00:01:42,029
senior in the org chart, ask your client or customer how good the service is.

34
00:01:42,029 --> 00:01:46,529
And also ask them how important that service is.

35
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:50,529
And keep your categories or badges really, really simple.

36
00:01:50,529 --> 00:01:52,529
Now I'm going to go through a complete example in the next slide

37
00:01:52,529 --> 00:01:55,196
so you fully understand what I'm getting to,

38
00:01:55,196 --> 00:01:59,196
the result of which will be where you need to focus your

39
00:01:59,196 --> 00:02:02,067
energies and your team to improve customer service.

40
00:02:02,067 --> 00:02:08,298
This will also help you focus on the right work that aligns to the business.

41
00:02:08,298 --> 00:02:11,529
Okay, now let's see a detailed example.

42
00:02:11,529 --> 00:02:15,529
Here's a technique I'm calling customer service quadrants.

43
00:02:15,529 --> 00:02:18,529
So here is an easy way to find out how you are

44
00:02:18,529 --> 00:02:20,196
doing with a customer or customers.

45
00:02:20,196 --> 00:02:24,683
I recommend you do this approach face to face with discussions as well.

46
00:02:24,683 --> 00:02:27,760
And you may learn more about the customer,

47
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:28,529
your service,

48
00:02:28,529 --> 00:02:34,529
and their expectations simply by going through this very simple process.

49
00:02:34,529 --> 00:02:36,404
Okay, here are the quadrants.

50
00:02:36,404 --> 00:02:43,029
On the left, on the Y axis, I'm going to have from not so good service,

51
00:02:43,029 --> 00:02:44,529
to good service.

52
00:02:44,529 --> 00:02:50,529
And on the bottom, the X axis, I'm going to have not so important,

53
00:02:50,529 --> 00:02:54,529
the kind of work and services that you do to pretty important.

54
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:59,529
Alright, so that quadrant would be not so important and not so good service.

55
00:02:59,529 --> 00:03:04,529
That quadrant would be not so important, but you're giving them good service.

56
00:03:04,529 --> 00:03:07,606
This is pretty darn important to the customer and you're

57
00:03:07,606 --> 00:03:09,529
doing really well in that quadrant,

58
00:03:09,529 --> 00:03:12,529
and this quadrant over here on the lower right,

59
00:03:12,529 --> 00:03:16,529
pretty important, but not so good service.

60
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,862
Okay, so that's how things would line up,

61
00:03:19,862 --> 00:03:22,929
and in those quadrants we're going to place a service or

62
00:03:22,929 --> 00:03:26,196
what I'm going to call a service badge and that's going to

63
00:03:26,196 --> 00:03:29,529
be placed there by your customer, not you.

64
00:03:29,529 --> 00:03:33,529
Okay, so here are the service badges I'm going to use in this example.

65
00:03:33,529 --> 00:03:35,711
Phone support, you provide phone support,

66
00:03:35,711 --> 00:03:39,165
and here's where they place that service badge,

67
00:03:39,165 --> 00:03:43,529
in the quadrant that says pretty good service,

68
00:03:43,529 --> 00:03:44,760
but not so important.

69
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,529
It's nice to have phone support, but to them not so important.

70
00:03:48,529 --> 00:03:51,529
There may be other things more important to them.

71
00:03:51,529 --> 00:03:55,529
Next, time to repair, that is time to fix something that went wrong,

72
00:03:55,529 --> 00:03:57,529
maybe a bug or maybe the machines went down.

73
00:03:57,529 --> 00:04:00,862
And this one's going to go in the upper right,

74
00:04:00,862 --> 00:04:04,315
that's very important to them and by the way they

75
00:04:04,315 --> 00:04:07,529
rate that as pretty good service, okay, well good.

76
00:04:07,529 --> 00:04:12,529
Both of these service badges or service categories are in the good service area.

77
00:04:12,529 --> 00:04:12,796
Good.

78
00:04:12,796 --> 00:04:15,729
Maybe you didn't know that or maybe you did know it

79
00:04:15,729 --> 00:04:17,696
and it reinforces your thoughts.

80
00:04:17,696 --> 00:04:19,446
Next, database security.

81
00:04:19,446 --> 00:04:26,074
They put in the lower right quadrant, pretty important to them,

82
00:04:26,074 --> 00:04:28,620
service, not so good,

83
00:04:28,620 --> 00:04:31,862
not horrible because it's in the upper part of that quadrant,

84
00:04:31,862 --> 00:04:32,529
but not so good.

85
00:04:32,529 --> 00:04:35,529
So that might be an area that you want to focus on.

86
00:04:35,529 --> 00:04:39,929
Hmm, so you're going to say well why is it that you put that service badge there?

87
00:04:39,929 --> 00:04:41,129
Start the dialog,

88
00:04:41,129 --> 00:04:44,862
better understand what the issues are so you can add

89
00:04:44,862 --> 00:04:46,529
those issues to your activities.

90
00:04:46,529 --> 00:04:48,243
The next examples is buggy software.

91
00:04:48,243 --> 00:04:52,529
Hmm, I wonder if they thing we have buggy software or not.

92
00:04:52,529 --> 00:04:54,029
They actually do.

93
00:04:54,029 --> 00:04:57,196
Having buggy software is pretty important to them,

94
00:04:57,196 --> 00:04:59,529
in other words, they don't want it,

95
00:04:59,529 --> 00:05:02,779
okay so we're in the not so good service on the left side,

96
00:05:02,779 --> 00:05:04,029
but very, very important.

97
00:05:04,029 --> 00:05:08,529
So we know that's a target area of improvement.

98
00:05:08,529 --> 00:05:11,029
That buggy software must be corrected.

99
00:05:11,029 --> 00:05:15,196
Alright, so this is the area that I have outlined here,

100
00:05:15,196 --> 00:05:17,973
the lower right quadrant is where it's really

101
00:05:17,973 --> 00:05:21,529
important to them and not so good service.

102
00:05:21,529 --> 00:05:26,172
So if this quadrant was empty, it did not have any service badges,

103
00:05:26,172 --> 00:05:28,452
great, you're doing pretty darn well.

104
00:05:28,452 --> 00:05:30,760
If anything is in this quadrant,

105
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:36,529
those are areas that I would say you'd want to attack first.

106
00:05:36,529 --> 00:05:40,375
So you can see that this very simple customer service

107
00:05:40,375 --> 00:05:43,452
quadrant can easily be used with your customer,

108
00:05:43,452 --> 00:05:46,529
very easy to read, very easy to understand,

109
00:05:46,529 --> 00:05:49,529
and it'll help target those areas that need improvement.

110
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,914
So I use this technique all the time, it works well,

111
00:05:52,914 --> 00:05:56,196
encourages dialog with the customer and give it a try,

112
00:05:56,196 --> 00:05:59,893
very simple and a very quick way to figure out where you

113
00:05:59,893 --> 00:06:01,529
need to improve your customer service.

114
00:06:01,529 --> 00:06:04,529
And by improving customer service you'll learn more about what your

115
00:06:04,529 --> 00:06:10,067
customers expect and this process will result in putting you more in

116
00:06:10,067 --> 00:06:17,000
sync with your customer's expectations. Okay, now let's summarize this module.
