Hi everyone,

2
00:00:01,667 --> 00:00:10,000
my name is Michael Krasowski and welcome to my course

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,000
Practical Team Management for Software Engineers.

4
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,000
So there you are, heads down and cranking out code,

5
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:21,000
life is grand, and you just love being a software engineer.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,824
Then one day your boss says to you,

7
00:00:23,824 --> 00:00:28,250
hey I think you've been doing a nice job and I'd like you to

8
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:30,500
be a manager and manage a team for me,

9
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:35,000
maybe about 5 or 8 developers and I will need you to work with the customers,

10
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:37,222
figure out and document requirements,

11
00:00:37,222 --> 00:00:39,444
determine your software development lifecycle,

12
00:00:39,444 --> 00:00:42,111
figure our your standards, your architecture,

13
00:00:42,111 --> 00:00:45,462
manage your work tasks, hire people, and all that stuff,

14
00:00:45,462 --> 00:00:50,333
and you know come up with all the team management things you think you need,

15
00:00:50,333 --> 00:00:53,091
and oh, by the way, you start tomorrow.

16
00:00:53,091 --> 00:00:56,000
If something like that has happened to you,

17
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:01,000
then you've come to the right place, this course is for you.

18
00:01:01,000 --> 00:01:03,786
This course is your starter kit and as a new manager or a

19
00:01:03,786 --> 00:01:06,083
manager needing to acquire new skills,

20
00:01:06,083 --> 00:01:09,800
we'll be covering the following major topics and themes.

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:13,714
Aligning IT activities to the business, managing customer expectations,

22
00:01:13,714 --> 00:01:17,286

23
00:01:17,286 --> 00:01:21,889

24
00:01:21,889 --> 00:01:25,000
and promoting productivity through team processes.

25
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:30,000
By the end of this course you will know how to begin your journey as a

26
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,182
new manager or a manager looking to improve your skills with the

27
00:01:34,182 --> 00:01:37,154
confidence and skills necessary for your success.

28
