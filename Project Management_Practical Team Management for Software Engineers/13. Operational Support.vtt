00:00:01.023 --> 00:00:03.523
So if you support several applications that run in production,

2
00:00:03.523 --> 00:00:07.023
they need to run perfectly smooth to support your customers and users.

3
00:00:07.023 --> 00:00:10.023
How do you know they are running perfectly?

4
00:00:10.023 --> 00:00:14.023
Are you waiting until someone calls you and then you react?

5
00:00:14.023 --> 00:00:17.478
There are many pieces to the operational activities puzzle and we will only

6
00:00:17.478 --> 00:00:22.023
talk about those that are more closely tied to applications.

7
00:00:22.023 --> 00:00:22.331
Again,

8
00:00:22.331 --> 00:00:26.023
each one of these sections that we've talked about in this module

9
00:00:26.023 --> 00:00:31.023
could be a complete class in their own right.

10
00:00:31.023 --> 00:00:33.023
IT operations generally covers everything,

11
00:00:33.023 --> 00:00:36.356
all IT functions outside of application programming management.

12
00:00:36.356 --> 00:00:40.478
Now I have researched to find the best definition I

13
00:00:40.478 --> 00:00:43.023
could and actually it wasn't so easy.

14
00:00:43.023 --> 00:00:46.023
But I like the definition I will now show you.

15
00:00:46.023 --> 00:00:48.023
It is a little wordy, but I like it the best.

16
00:00:48.023 --> 00:00:49.114
Here it is.

17
00:00:49.114 --> 00:00:53.273
IT Operations is responsible for the smooth functioning of the

18
00:00:53.273 --> 00:00:57.594
infrastructure and operational environments that support application

19
00:00:57.594 --> 00:01:01.323
deployment to internal or external customers… Okay,

20
00:01:01.323 --> 00:01:02.523
a few more words.

21
00:01:02.523 --> 00:01:05.134
…including the network infrastructure; server and device

22
00:01:05.134 --> 00:01:08.467
management; computer ops; IT infrastructure library,

23
00:01:08.467 --> 00:01:14.023
that ITIL management; and help desk services for an organization.

24
00:01:14.023 --> 00:01:17.023
I would like to credit Joe Hertvik for this definition.

25
00:01:17.023 --> 00:01:23.023
So let's talk about the scope of operational support for this section.

26
00:01:23.023 --> 00:01:24.408
Here's a quick note on scope.

27
00:01:24.408 --> 00:01:28.296
I would like to provide some scope and boundaries to this section.

28
00:01:28.296 --> 00:01:33.690
Remember operational support is a very broad discipline so I want to focus this

29
00:01:33.690 --> 00:01:38.100
section on those activities that are more aligned closely with applications and

30
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:43.023
not the broad and wide operations discipline.

31
00:01:43.023 --> 00:01:46.223
All the items I'm about to talk about could in fact be

32
00:01:46.223 --> 00:01:49.023
managed and run by the application teams,

33
00:01:49.023 --> 00:01:51.023
especially in smaller companies.

34
00:01:51.023 --> 00:01:51.773
That's totally fine.

35
00:01:51.773 --> 00:01:54.823
The important thing is that you understand as a new manager

36
00:01:54.823 --> 00:01:56.823
that there are operational responsibilities,

37
00:01:56.823 --> 00:01:58.638
that either you, your team,

38
00:01:58.638 --> 00:02:02.690
or a dedicated ops team must manage and address to support your applications.

39
00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:04.356
Okay, the first ID management,

40
00:02:04.356 --> 00:02:10.023
people may need to have IDs to access the systems that you support.

41
00:02:10.023 --> 00:02:11.023
Application feature authorization,

42
00:02:11.023 --> 00:02:14.485
in other words I have an ID to access your system,

43
00:02:14.485 --> 00:02:17.023
but you're only going to let me do a few functions,

44
00:02:17.023 --> 00:02:18.523
and maybe to a manager you might give many,

45
00:02:18.523 --> 00:02:19.023
many more functions.

46
00:02:19.023 --> 00:02:21.423
You're going to need to do the hot fixes,

47
00:02:21.423 --> 00:02:23.594
break and fix and repairing problems that occur.

48
00:02:23.594 --> 00:02:27.023
It may happen at any time, in the middle of the night,

49
00:02:27.023 --> 00:02:31.023
on weekends, you've got to jump in and make those fixes.

50
00:02:31.023 --> 00:02:33.166
Off-the-shelf software installation and configuration

51
00:02:33.166 --> 00:02:35.134
for business application support.

52
00:02:35.134 --> 00:02:40.166
So you may have other off-the-shelf products or tools that you're

53
00:02:40.166 --> 00:02:43.023
going to need to be installed and supported as well.

54
00:02:43.023 --> 00:02:44.023
Database maintenance.

55
00:02:44.023 --> 00:02:47.690
Applications and users maintain the database from a

56
00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:49.690
database integrity viewpoint, in other words,

57
00:02:49.690 --> 00:02:53.023
they know their data and it's business meaning,

58
00:02:53.023 --> 00:02:57.356
whereas operations maintains it from an efficiency and processing viewpoint,

59
00:02:57.356 --> 00:02:59.478
you know, cleaning up, deleting records,

60
00:02:59.478 --> 00:03:04.023
and re-indexing and doing performance tuning and things like that.

61
00:03:04.023 --> 00:03:05.690
Next would be data movement.

62
00:03:05.690 --> 00:03:09.690
You're going to maybe do file transfers and moving transactional data,

63
00:03:09.690 --> 00:03:13.023
say to a warehouse database, things like that.

64
00:03:13.023 --> 00:03:16.387
So they'll be things that move data around and you need to make sure it

65
00:03:16.387 --> 00:03:20.023
doesn't move successfully and is it moving the right data.

66
00:03:20.023 --> 00:03:21.223
And then lastly,

67
00:03:21.223 --> 00:03:24.452
monitoring application performance and issues and alerting the

68
00:03:24.452 --> 00:03:27.023
emergency resources when a problem occurs.

69
00:03:27.023 --> 00:03:29.273
Now let's look at a few more application operational

70
00:03:29.273 --> 00:03:33.023
activities you need to be aware of.

71
00:03:33.023 --> 00:03:37.023
Here are a few more application operational activities to be aware of,

72
00:03:37.023 --> 00:03:41.023
integration with business partners, customers or other entities.

73
00:03:41.023 --> 00:03:44.023
You might do FTP, EDI, ECommerce, things like that,

74
00:03:44.023 --> 00:03:45.309
copying data between servers,

75
00:03:45.309 --> 00:03:49.023
all those things need to be looked at and be made aware of.

76
00:03:49.023 --> 00:03:50.177
The help desk,

77
00:03:50.177 --> 00:03:54.023
now the help desk duties are sometimes split between IT

78
00:03:54.023 --> 00:03:58.023
applications help desk and an IT operations help desk.

79
00:03:58.023 --> 00:04:00.773
Usually the ops help desk is what they call level 1

80
00:04:00.773 --> 00:04:02.946
and the app help desk is level 2.

81
00:04:02.946 --> 00:04:05.715
Maybe you have your level 2 people assigned by

82
00:04:05.715 --> 00:04:07.690
application experience or something like that.

83
00:04:07.690 --> 00:04:10.023
Every company may be a bit different.

84
00:04:10.023 --> 00:04:13.356
Job scheduling management to ensure that all required jobs run according

85
00:04:13.356 --> 00:04:16.023
to schedule on all platforms for all applications.

86
00:04:16.023 --> 00:04:20.023
Many times things are scheduled because they're moving data from one

87
00:04:20.023 --> 00:04:22.356
system to another or creating data warehouses,

88
00:04:22.356 --> 00:04:25.750
creating reports, who knows, all sorts of things.

89
00:04:25.750 --> 00:04:26.205
Also,

90
00:04:26.205 --> 00:04:29.623
actively monitoring and then triggering alerts and generating

91
00:04:29.623 --> 00:04:32.823
tickets and then informing key people of an issue.

92
00:04:32.823 --> 00:04:35.756
You need to define what are the rules and what are

93
00:04:35.756 --> 00:04:40.023
the things you need to monitor, build triggers around those monitoring models,

94
00:04:40.023 --> 00:04:42.773
if they don't meet the certain thresholds you're going to generate

95
00:04:42.773 --> 00:04:46.296
tickets that go into a ticketing system and maybe automatically

96
00:04:46.296 --> 00:04:48.023
inform someone that there's an issue.

97
00:04:48.023 --> 00:04:49.023
This is very proactive.

98
00:04:49.023 --> 00:04:52.408
The last thing you'll want is the CEO calling you at

99
00:04:52.408 --> 00:04:54.090
home because the system is down.

100
00:04:54.090 --> 00:04:57.666
You want to know first, not last, and have a chance to fix it.

101
00:04:57.666 --> 00:04:58.094
Call center,

102
00:04:58.094 --> 00:05:01.254
many times you're going to have maybe a formal call center or maybe

103
00:05:01.254 --> 00:05:05.223
your little team just has one particular phone number that gets called

104
00:05:05.223 --> 00:05:08.023
and everyone takes turns taking those calls.

105
00:05:08.023 --> 00:05:11.023
It can be very informal to very sophisticated.

106
00:05:11.023 --> 00:05:17.023
Escalation, you need a clear escalation path for when an issue is determined,

107
00:05:17.023 --> 00:05:22.023
who is informed and have it move quickly up the org chart as needed.

108
00:05:22.023 --> 00:05:24.594
The ops role is always looking to find, fix,

109
00:05:24.594 --> 00:05:27.408
and inform on any issues that may occur.

110
00:05:27.408 --> 00:05:28.792
Logging and tracking,

111
00:05:28.792 --> 00:05:33.690
apps need to constantly log and track their activity at all times.

112
00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:36.023
Typically software engineers build the functional specifications,

113
00:05:36.023 --> 00:05:39.523
but forget that logging and tracking should be probably

114
00:05:39.523 --> 00:05:42.023
part of the technical specifications.

115
00:05:42.023 --> 00:05:44.023
So in the event an issue does happen,

116
00:05:44.023 --> 00:05:49.023
it is so easy to review and look in the log and see what the issue might be.

117
00:05:49.023 --> 00:05:53.023
So we have covered a plethora of operational topics related to applications,

118
00:05:53.023 --> 00:05:56.356
and again, these should all be part of your business,

119
00:05:56.356 --> 00:06:00.223
whether partially staffed by your dev team or a separate

120
00:06:00.223 --> 00:06:09.000
ops team or some combination of both. Now let's move on to an area that many times is overlooked and not appreciated.
