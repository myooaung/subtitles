00:00:01.208 --> 00:00:04.408
Many times our customers in the corporate world,

2
00:00:04.408 --> 00:00:08.541
versus consulting, think your service is infinite.

3
00:00:08.541 --> 00:00:13.208
They may ask and ask for more.

4
00:00:13.208 --> 00:00:15.516
be sure you spend time with each key customer and

5
00:00:15.516 --> 00:00:20.708
explain the scope of your team, how many resources your team has,

6
00:00:20.708 --> 00:00:23.458
maybe your budget and other attributes,

7
00:00:23.458 --> 00:00:28.351
and also talk about how you can work together to meet their needs.

8
00:00:28.351 --> 00:00:31.208
For example, if you can transfer some budget to me,

9
00:00:31.208 --> 00:00:34.208
I can bring on an extra contractor to help out.

10
00:00:34.208 --> 00:00:35.875
Resources, your resources,

11
00:00:35.875 --> 00:00:40.572
people and maybe some discretionary budget are certainly limited.

12
00:00:40.572 --> 00:00:44.208
You can only do so much with that.

13
00:00:44.208 --> 00:00:48.208
For example, show your customer your projects and your activities,

14
00:00:48.208 --> 00:00:52.208
like we discussed in the module aligning IT to the business.

15
00:00:52.208 --> 00:00:54.565
Walk through what is in the priority of item 1 and

16
00:00:54.565 --> 00:00:56.458
item 2 buckets and the backlog.

17
00:00:56.458 --> 00:01:01.875
Discuss that with more resources you can do more or you can move the

18
00:01:01.875 --> 00:01:05.208
schedule out or you can take something off the list,

19
00:01:05.208 --> 00:01:06.941
that is move it to the backlog and maybe make room for a

20
00:01:06.941 --> 00:01:08.922
new item in priority 1 or priority 2.

21
00:01:08.922 --> 00:01:12.875
Get them to have an appreciation of your constraints and get them

22
00:01:12.875 --> 00:01:16.208
involved in helping manage your resources with you.

23
00:01:16.208 --> 00:01:20.208
Time of day, some of us have really crazy hours.

24
00:01:20.208 --> 00:01:23.875
Figure out what coverage you think you need to cover your

25
00:01:23.875 --> 00:01:25.572
customer's expectations of support.

26
00:01:25.572 --> 00:01:30.708
For example, if you need to have coverage from 6:00 AM to 6:00 PM,

27
00:01:30.708 --> 00:01:33.764
lay out the schedule with your team and be sure your

28
00:01:33.764 --> 00:01:38.208
customers know what is in the coverage range.

29
00:01:38.208 --> 00:01:41.737
You may also have to publish an on call list of numbers

30
00:01:41.737 --> 00:01:44.875
and names to call on for the off hours.

31
00:01:44.875 --> 00:01:48.741
Now every customer is different, but be careful and cautious,

32
00:01:48.741 --> 00:01:52.208
you don't want to get your team all burned out with crazy hours.

33
00:01:52.208 --> 00:01:54.516
So you'll want to manage your team very well and

34
00:01:54.516 --> 00:01:56.875
integrate that with your customer's needs to.

35
00:01:56.875 --> 00:02:00.875
Negotiate with your customers and see if you can give

36
00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:03.208
them what they need and document it.

37
00:02:03.208 --> 00:02:07.090
And also help manage and take care of your team as

38
00:02:07.090 --> 00:02:09.208
well so they don't have burnout.

39
00:02:09.208 --> 00:02:10.299
Demand management,

40
00:02:10.299 --> 00:02:15.977
this is the method for managing or the term for managing

41
00:02:15.977 --> 00:02:20.565
all the work that comes into your team through a common or

42
00:02:20.565 --> 00:02:22.351
central focal point or process.

43
00:02:22.351 --> 00:02:27.608
I will talk more about this in another module because it is so important

44
00:02:27.608 --> 00:02:30.208
to managing customer expectations and your workload.

45
00:02:30.208 --> 00:02:35.408
So at this point in the course just note that you need a demand management

46
00:02:35.408 --> 00:02:40.208
process and we will pick up on it again in more detail.

47
00:02:40.208 --> 00:02:44.054
Okay, here's a quote, barring the grammar for a moment,

48
00:02:44.054 --> 00:02:49.208
"man's got to know his limitations", a Clint Eastwood quote which I really like.

49
00:02:49.208 --> 00:02:54.208
There are in fact limitations and your customer probably truly knows it,

50
00:02:54.208 --> 00:02:57.208
but you're going to have to communicate clearly and make sure he or she

51
00:02:57.208 --> 00:03:02.208
has that deep appreciation that you can only do so much.

52
00:03:02.208 --> 00:03:06.208
Okay so how do you say no?

53
00:03:06.208 --> 00:03:10.208
That can be a very difficult thing.

54
00:03:10.208 --> 00:03:15.208
Let's see a few tips on how best to say no.

55
00:03:15.208 --> 00:03:20.208
Now let's talk about timelines, software has bugs, we all know that.

56
00:03:20.208 --> 00:03:23.208
But bugs in our software programs can be irritating,

57
00:03:23.208 --> 00:03:25.494
costly, and frustrating to your customers.

58
00:03:25.494 --> 00:03:30.208
So whatever timeline you provide, be sure you can meet it.

59
00:03:30.208 --> 00:03:34.270
I would rather say 2 weeks and be done in 10 days than

60
00:03:34.270 --> 00:03:37.291
say 10 days and it take 2 weeks.

61
00:03:37.291 --> 00:03:40.565
You can manage customer expectations by clearly stating

62
00:03:40.565 --> 00:03:44.494
how long any particular task or activity will take and yes

63
00:03:44.494 --> 00:03:46.875
I know things can go wrong.

64
00:03:46.875 --> 00:03:49.791
When you provide a timeline or milestone,

65
00:03:49.791 --> 00:03:53.481
also include assumptions if necessary that if

66
00:03:53.481 --> 00:03:56.208
triggered would affect the schedule.

67
00:03:56.208 --> 00:04:00.593
For example, we have the holiday season and some of my team is taking vacation,

68
00:04:00.593 --> 00:04:05.208
we will need 12 business days to get out the next release,

69
00:04:05.208 --> 00:04:11.208
I will try and add resources but to be safe I can make it in 12 days.

70
00:04:11.208 --> 00:04:14.285
This may help them understand the bigger picture

71
00:04:14.285 --> 00:04:16.208
and help set their expectations.

72
00:04:16.208 --> 00:04:19.439
Also you always want to be realistic.

73
00:04:19.439 --> 00:04:22.823
Now while optimism is an attribute your customer

74
00:04:22.823 --> 00:04:24.977
would likely want to see from you,

75
00:04:24.977 --> 00:04:29.208
you must also remain realistic about solutions,

76
00:04:29.208 --> 00:04:32.208
estimates, and timelines.

77
00:04:32.208 --> 00:04:34.608
While it can be really tough to tell a customer a problem

78
00:04:34.608 --> 00:04:36.875
will take longer than expected to resolve,

79
00:04:36.875 --> 00:04:40.494
it is more important to be realistic than set

80
00:04:40.494 --> 00:04:42.208
expectations that just can't be met.

81
00:04:42.208 --> 00:04:45.041
And if you're in one of those tough spots,

82
00:04:45.041 --> 00:04:48.375
provide more detail if the customer wants it,

83
00:04:48.375 --> 00:04:52.065
about why you need the extra time, focus on quality,

84
00:04:52.065 --> 00:04:55.746
it is hard for a customer to argue with quality.

85
00:04:55.746 --> 00:04:58.439
So the rule of thumb, be realistic,

86
00:04:58.439 --> 00:05:03.026
for example testing the order management system with the

87
00:05:03.026 --> 00:05:07.117
newly integrated ERP system is just turning out to be more

88
00:05:07.117 --> 00:05:08.208
complicated than we thought.

89
00:05:08.208 --> 00:05:11.032
It requires test data to be set up by the order team

90
00:05:11.032 --> 00:05:12.593
and they are a bit shorthanded.

91
00:05:12.593 --> 00:05:17.977
Maybe we can all meet together and see how we can improve the situation.

92
00:05:17.977 --> 00:05:19.131
In other words,

93
00:05:19.131 --> 00:05:23.439
it's not only you and your software team in this case that

94
00:05:23.439 --> 00:05:25.593
is responsible to get the release out,

95
00:05:25.593 --> 00:05:29.408
but also a completely different team that you don't manage

96
00:05:29.408 --> 00:05:32.208
that's providing the right test data,

97
00:05:32.208 --> 00:05:35.208
explaining to your customer the complexities,

98
00:05:35.208 --> 00:05:38.481
again, not just technical but organizational in this case,

99
00:05:38.481 --> 00:05:44.208
helps them understand the bigger picture and helps set their expectations.

100
00:05:44.208 --> 00:05:45.572
Next, remain optimistic.

101
00:05:45.572 --> 00:05:50.351
Always remain positive with a we're going to get this done attitude,

102
00:05:50.351 --> 00:05:54.362
yet be sure to keep the pulse of the customer at all times.

103
00:05:54.362 --> 00:06:00.083
They will know when they may be pushing too hard and you will know if there

104
00:06:00.083 --> 00:06:03.208
is something they've got to just have no matter what.

105
00:06:03.208 --> 00:06:05.208
If you have an honest,

106
00:06:05.208 --> 00:06:09.054
trustworthy relationship with your customer you will be better

107
00:06:09.054 --> 00:06:13.208
equipped emotionally to keep a good dose of optimism.

108
00:06:13.208 --> 00:06:17.753
Remember your team will feed off of your emotions if you are down or depressed,

109
00:06:17.753 --> 00:06:23.208
they may empathize and absorb some of that as well.

110
00:06:23.208 --> 00:06:24.746
You don't want that.

111
00:06:24.746 --> 00:06:30.026
You want them to see you upbeat and optimistic, but grounded in reality.

112
00:06:30.026 --> 00:06:33.208
That is the best mix or blend.

113
00:06:33.208 --> 00:06:36.670
Yep hard to do, but it is very important.

114
00:06:36.670 --> 00:06:38.208
So here's a thought,

115
00:06:38.208 --> 00:06:41.844
maybe you can promise your customers that they will have

116
00:06:41.844 --> 00:06:45.065
immediate and constant access to me and my team,

117
00:06:45.065 --> 00:06:51.054
me being the manager, and that your team will every day work on behalf of them,

118
00:06:51.054 --> 00:06:52.958
supporting their needs, goals and issues.

119
00:06:52.958 --> 00:06:57.208
It's kind of a high level statement that says we're here for you no matter what.

120
00:06:57.208 --> 00:06:59.208
Obviously the devil is in the details,

121
00:06:59.208 --> 00:07:04.375
but if you manage your customer's expectations things will work out quite well.

122
00:07:04.375 --> 00:07:10.208
And lastly, "the optimist sees the opportunity in every difficulty",

123
00:07:10.208 --> 00:07:12.608
that's a quote by Winston Churchill.

124
00:07:12.608 --> 00:07:16.208
There are always challenges and difficulties at work.

125
00:07:16.208 --> 00:07:19.208
That's why they call it work.

126
00:07:19.208 --> 00:07:24.208
But each one can have several opportunities to work with new people,

127
00:07:24.208 --> 00:07:35.000
learn new things, accomplish milestones, and just feel good about helping your customers and actually a whole lot more.
