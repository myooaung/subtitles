1
00:00:01,991 --> 00:00:04,718
Now let's break down an SLA.

2
00:00:04,718 --> 00:00:07,616
SLAs typically contain the following attributes,

3
00:00:07,616 --> 00:00:11,991
a description of the service being provided.

4
00:00:11,991 --> 00:00:13,991
For example, maintenance of areas such as network connectivity,

5
00:00:13,991 --> 00:00:18,082
maintaining an application software, or writing ad hoc reports,

6
00:00:18,082 --> 00:00:18,991
et cetera.

7
00:00:18,991 --> 00:00:19,991
Next, reliability.

8
00:00:19,991 --> 00:00:22,491
When the service is available,

9
00:00:22,491 --> 00:00:28,158
percentage up time and the limits outages can be expected to stay within,

10
00:00:28,158 --> 00:00:28,991
for example.

11
00:00:28,991 --> 00:00:29,391
Responsiveness.

12
00:00:29,391 --> 00:00:33,391
The punctuality of services to be performed in response to

13
00:00:33,391 --> 00:00:35,391
requests and scheduled service dates.

14
00:00:35,391 --> 00:00:38,446
Procedure for reporting problems, who can be contacted,

15
00:00:38,446 --> 00:00:41,658
how many problems will be reported, procedure for escalation,

16
00:00:41,658 --> 00:00:45,547
and what other steps are taken to resolve the problem efficiently.

17
00:00:45,547 --> 00:00:50,348
Monitoring and reporting service level, who will monitor performance,

18
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:55,324
what data will be collected and how often as well as how much access

19
00:00:55,324 --> 00:00:57,991
the customer is given to the performance statistics.

20
00:00:57,991 --> 00:00:58,616
For example,

21
00:00:58,616 --> 00:01:05,173
I may report in a weekly status that we closed 5 bugs and have 7 in the backlog.

22
00:01:05,173 --> 00:01:08,991
Next, consequences for not meeting service obligations.

23
00:01:08,991 --> 00:01:13,991
These may include credit or reimbursement of hours or budgets to customers.

24
00:01:13,991 --> 00:01:16,391
Sometimes in our company if we have a bug,

25
00:01:16,391 --> 00:01:18,536
well we fix it and don't charge the customer,

26
00:01:18,536 --> 00:01:22,562
that's part of the consequences of not meeting our service obligation.

27
00:01:22,562 --> 00:01:25,991
Escape clauses or constraints.

28
00:01:25,991 --> 00:01:30,991
Circumstances under which the level of service promised does not apply.

29
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:35,991
As an example, holidays and weekends may have different constraints.

30
00:01:35,991 --> 00:01:39,991
You are all welcome to add or subtract any attributes that would make

31
00:01:39,991 --> 00:01:42,658
better sense to your service and product offerings,

32
00:01:42,658 --> 00:01:47,991
but you at least get the idea of what an SLA is trying to do.

33
00:01:47,991 --> 00:01:51,191
Okay let's see specific examples of each attribute

34
00:01:51,191 --> 00:01:55,991
pertaining to software engineering.

35
00:01:55,991 --> 00:01:58,848
Okay in this example, you the new manager,

36
00:01:58,848 --> 00:02:02,491
is responsible for a team of five software engineers

37
00:02:02,491 --> 00:02:04,991
supporting the sales business domain.

38
00:02:04,991 --> 00:02:07,991
You have been noticing a mismatch between what you thought you were

39
00:02:07,991 --> 00:02:11,991
delivering to your customers and what the customers really wanted.

40
00:02:11,991 --> 00:02:16,606
Hence, their expectations are different from yours and what you are to deliver,

41
00:02:16,606 --> 00:02:19,991
so you think the SLA may be the way to go.

42
00:02:19,991 --> 00:02:23,991
Okay, so you fire up MS Word, drop in the attributes from the last slide,

43
00:02:23,991 --> 00:02:25,082
and start typing.

44
00:02:25,082 --> 00:02:27,991
You want to start getting your thoughts together.

45
00:02:27,991 --> 00:02:30,769
Okay, first your service description,

46
00:02:30,769 --> 00:02:34,241
provide all application development and support for

47
00:02:34,241 --> 00:02:38,718
the sales application portfolio, that's a great high level mission statement.

48
00:02:38,718 --> 00:02:43,355
And some detail examples may mean that I support the prospects system,

49
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:48,241
I support the Salesforce interface, and I support the ERP interface.

50
00:02:48,241 --> 00:02:51,991
Those are the key three things that you support.

51
00:02:51,991 --> 00:02:54,529
Now for this example in the following slides it will give

52
00:02:54,529 --> 00:02:56,222
you examples of the SLA attributes.

53
00:02:56,222 --> 00:02:58,991
I'm going to provide you a relatively light weight

54
00:02:58,991 --> 00:03:00,809
set of descriptions and examples.

55
00:03:00,809 --> 00:03:04,705
You will more than likely provide more comprehensive

56
00:03:04,705 --> 00:03:08,991
descriptions and be more thorough.

57
00:03:08,991 --> 00:03:11,491
The next attribute is business alignment,

58
00:03:11,491 --> 00:03:15,791
so I would write my group participates in quarterly planning to ensure

59
00:03:15,791 --> 00:03:18,658
our work and projects are aligned with the business.

60
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,324
Basically I, as the manager,

61
00:03:20,324 --> 00:03:23,446
will follow the guidelines of activities that I have outlined in

62
00:03:23,446 --> 00:03:25,991
the module when aligning IT to the business.

63
00:03:25,991 --> 00:03:30,491
So some example details, would be I have some active projects,

64
00:03:30,491 --> 00:03:33,991
A and B are aligned to ITG-1.

65
00:03:33,991 --> 00:03:34,491
1.

66
00:03:34,491 --> 00:03:38,991
1 and also adding 100 new courses to the on-line catalog.

67
00:03:38,991 --> 00:03:43,241
So I just took some of the material from the aligning IT to the business module.

68
00:03:43,241 --> 00:03:46,355
And you may have several other examples certainly in this one category.

69
00:03:46,355 --> 00:03:52,991
And again, I'm taking the light weight approach just for an example.

70
00:03:52,991 --> 00:03:55,173
The next SLA attribute is reliability.

71
00:03:55,173 --> 00:04:00,324
Each system is tested thoroughly before being released to the customer,

72
00:04:00,324 --> 00:04:01,991
well, of course.

73
00:04:01,991 --> 00:04:05,068
Example details would be we perform unit testing,

74
00:04:05,068 --> 00:04:08,241
we do use case testing in 4 environment,

75
00:04:08,241 --> 00:04:13,355
dev, QA, stage, and production, and follow a rigorous release management process.

76
00:04:13,355 --> 00:04:14,264
So again,

77
00:04:14,264 --> 00:04:17,891
here's how we ensure that reliability happens and the

78
00:04:17,891 --> 00:04:19,991
steps that we take to ensure it.

79
00:04:19,991 --> 00:04:26,991
Therefore, this is how the reliability section is written for your SLA.

80
00:04:26,991 --> 00:04:29,264
The next attribute is responsiveness.

81
00:04:29,264 --> 00:04:33,658
We follow an issue management process and will respond

82
00:04:33,658 --> 00:04:36,991
to posted issues within 2 hours.

83
00:04:36,991 --> 00:04:38,241
Some detail examples,

84
00:04:38,241 --> 00:04:43,658
we use a web-based issue tracking system that routes issues to our

85
00:04:43,658 --> 00:04:52,000
support center for disposition and remediation. So we lay out the attribute and what we do about it.
