00:00:00.495 --> 00:00:04.495
So hopefully I have persuaded you that process is important.

2
00:00:04.495 --> 00:00:08.495
Now let's talk about managing your processes and it's pretty easy really.

3
00:00:08.495 --> 00:00:12.726
If you do not manage your processes, they just fade away,

4
00:00:12.726 --> 00:00:15.995
become brittle and will not be used.

5
00:00:15.995 --> 00:00:19.495
And let's see how we do that.

6
00:00:19.495 --> 00:00:21.695
Before we get into the 10 key processes for your team,

7
00:00:21.695 --> 00:00:24.095
I want to first talk about the following.

8
00:00:24.095 --> 00:00:26.495
How will you manage your processes?

9
00:00:26.495 --> 00:00:28.638
Well here is an easy way.

10
00:00:28.638 --> 00:00:31.495
You want to manage and measure each process,

11
00:00:31.495 --> 00:00:33.341
you want to document and store your processes,

12
00:00:33.341 --> 00:00:38.495
and you want to educate and train your team on the processes as well.

13
00:00:38.495 --> 00:00:40.066
Now let's jump into each one of these very quickly before

14
00:00:40.066 --> 00:00:45.495
we move on to your 10 key processes.

15
00:00:45.495 --> 00:00:46.495
Manage and measure,

16
00:00:46.495 --> 00:00:49.495
you are the process owner who has the ultimate

17
00:00:49.495 --> 00:00:52.273
responsibility for the processes performance,

18
00:00:52.273 --> 00:00:55.495
that is the success in realizing their objectives,

19
00:00:55.495 --> 00:00:58.586
the things the process is trying to do or accomplish,

20
00:00:58.586 --> 00:01:01.313
measured by key process indicators,

21
00:01:01.313 --> 00:01:07.495
and has the authority and ability to make the necessary changes.

22
00:01:07.495 --> 00:01:11.495
Next you want to determine what processes are needed for your team's success.

23
00:01:11.495 --> 00:01:13.495
In this module I am recommending several processes

24
00:01:13.495 --> 00:01:14.957
that help you get started quickly.

25
00:01:14.957 --> 00:01:18.638
You may adopt them or see them as templates to create your own.

26
00:01:18.638 --> 00:01:21.495
For each, determine the outcomes.

27
00:01:21.495 --> 00:01:24.638
This is important so as you build and design your process

28
00:01:24.638 --> 00:01:26.726
you always have the outcomes in mind,

29
00:01:26.726 --> 00:01:31.131
hence you are validating that the process will produce the outcomes expected.

30
00:01:31.131 --> 00:01:35.495
Ensure the team has input and buy in.

31
00:01:35.495 --> 00:01:37.341
You will never likely get total buy in,

32
00:01:37.341 --> 00:01:39.745
some engineers just don't like processes at all.

33
00:01:39.745 --> 00:01:43.495
If you think a process is required and critical,

34
00:01:43.495 --> 00:01:46.695
then it's use is a condition of employment,

35
00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:47.495
no exceptions.

36
00:01:47.495 --> 00:01:50.495
If they know they can break the rules, they will.

37
00:01:50.495 --> 00:01:53.352
Okay, I hope that this is an exception for you,

38
00:01:53.352 --> 00:01:57.495
since getting the majority team buy in is by far the best approach.

39
00:01:57.495 --> 00:02:00.495
But just be prepared, it won't always be easy,

40
00:02:00.495 --> 00:02:05.606
and as a manager you will have to make some hard decisions at times.

41
00:02:05.606 --> 00:02:09.495
Periodic measurement, how good is your process?

42
00:02:09.495 --> 00:02:10.495
Is it used?

43
00:02:10.495 --> 00:02:11.495
Is it beneficial?

44
00:02:11.495 --> 00:02:13.495
I like to keep measurements simple.

45
00:02:13.495 --> 00:02:15.295
Here is how I like to measure our processes,

46
00:02:15.295 --> 00:02:18.313
get the team in a room and just ask them.

47
00:02:18.313 --> 00:02:21.495
Find out what works, keep that stuff.

48
00:02:21.495 --> 00:02:25.495
Find out what doesn't work, remove or change.

49
00:02:25.495 --> 00:02:29.495
And lastly, is there anything we need to add to the process?

50
00:02:29.495 --> 00:02:32.495
This could be done in about an hour or two in most occasions.

51
00:02:32.495 --> 00:02:37.495
What I like to do is to review my processes once a quarter with the team.

52
00:02:37.495 --> 00:02:41.495
We set up a reoccurring quarterly meeting to review each process,

53
00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:43.745
usually it is pretty quick actually since most processes

54
00:02:43.745 --> 00:02:46.033
will not need to change each quarter.

55
00:02:46.033 --> 00:02:49.495
And if changes are required, we either make them,

56
00:02:49.495 --> 00:02:54.726
then we document them or if the changes are major and if we need some analysis,

57
00:02:54.726 --> 00:02:58.162
I might make an assignment to someone or myself and we hold the second

58
00:02:58.162 --> 00:03:01.950
meeting to review the research and update the process accordingly and

59
00:03:01.950 --> 00:03:04.677
then we update the process documentation,

60
00:03:04.677 --> 00:03:09.677
safely store and then educate or train the team as appropriate.

61
00:03:09.677 --> 00:03:13.295
This process for managing our processes is actually pretty simple,

62
00:03:13.295 --> 00:03:19.395
pretty straightforward, and once you do it a few times very,

63
00:03:19.395 --> 00:03:21.495
very easy indeed.

64
00:03:21.495 --> 00:03:22.245
Document and store.

65
00:03:22.245 --> 00:03:26.341
Now that you have determined what processes you need to run your team,

66
00:03:26.341 --> 00:03:30.495
you need to do the following, document each process.

67
00:03:30.495 --> 00:03:33.295
Maybe use a Word document, Visio flowchart,

68
00:03:33.295 --> 00:03:35.924
PowerPoint graphics, or other tools at your disposal.

69
00:03:35.924 --> 00:03:39.295
Don't panic, a process may be just one page of material.

70
00:03:39.295 --> 00:03:44.495
It does not have to be fancy or long, and typically should not,

71
00:03:44.495 --> 00:03:46.649
but it does need to be documented.

72
00:03:46.649 --> 00:03:48.495
You cannot, and I will repeat,

73
00:03:48.495 --> 00:03:54.495
you cannot improve a process or teach others quickly if it is not documented.

74
00:03:54.495 --> 00:03:58.495
Store safely, maybe a user remote drive, the cloud or a document repository.

75
00:03:58.495 --> 00:04:02.131
You could even use a software configuration tool like TFS,

76
00:04:02.131 --> 00:04:06.495
whatever makes it easy for everyone to get to and modify and update.

77
00:04:06.495 --> 00:04:07.859
Enable easy access.

78
00:04:07.859 --> 00:04:14.412
Why have your processes documented if no one can easily find them and read them?

79
00:04:14.412 --> 00:04:18.578
And also important is to easily update them since the

80
00:04:18.578 --> 00:04:21.495
processes may change and evolve over time.

81
00:04:21.495 --> 00:04:25.495
Alright next, be proactive with training your team on the processes.

82
00:04:25.495 --> 00:04:31.495
Don't just assume they'll read them and figure them out.

83
00:04:31.495 --> 00:04:32.995
Educate and train.

84
00:04:32.995 --> 00:04:37.313
Ensure understanding and appreciation of the process and how it

85
00:04:37.313 --> 00:04:39.495
adds value to your team is very important.

86
00:04:39.495 --> 00:04:41.495
If your team does not understand that,

87
00:04:41.495 --> 00:04:45.273
then they will not use it or maybe resist its use.

88
00:04:45.273 --> 00:04:47.495
This is just human nature.

89
00:04:47.495 --> 00:04:50.066
So you want to make sure they understand how the process works,

90
00:04:50.066 --> 00:04:52.495
since you will document it they will know what it is.

91
00:04:52.495 --> 00:04:55.495
Remember a process can be a simple one page checklist.

92
00:04:55.495 --> 00:04:58.495
Don't think a process needs to be 1000 pages.

93
00:04:58.495 --> 00:05:01.495
Do you want to know exactly how long your documentation should be?

94
00:05:01.495 --> 00:05:03.995
Well let me tell you, it depends.

95
00:05:03.995 --> 00:05:06.495
I knew you would like that answer.

96
00:05:06.495 --> 00:05:07.352
But it does,

97
00:05:07.352 --> 00:05:10.895
it needs to be long enough to cover the subject and short

98
00:05:10.895 --> 00:05:13.695
enough to ensure it is understandable, usable,

99
00:05:13.695 --> 00:05:16.162
and provides demonstrateable value to your team.

100
00:05:16.162 --> 00:05:17.495
Next, when to use,

101
00:05:17.495 --> 00:05:22.131
be sure your team understands when your process needs to be

102
00:05:22.131 --> 00:05:25.578
applied or used and in under what circumstances.

103
00:05:25.578 --> 00:05:28.495
Lastly, how it is measured and improved?

104
00:05:28.495 --> 00:05:31.495
Ensure they understand that the process is not set in stone and it is

105
00:05:31.495 --> 00:05:42.000
regularly reviewed and improved as we discussed before. Okay, let's check out the 10 processes in your starter kit.
