00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:02.150
A final word.

2
00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:04.190
Thank you very, very much for taking my course.

3
00:00:04.190 --> 00:00:10.210
I, like you, confronted my fears of transitioning from a techy to a manager.

4
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.712
My transformation was a struggle and challenge at

5
00:00:13.712 --> 00:00:17.160
times and actually took several years, so be patient.

6
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:21.883
As I look back I am glad and have been rewarded by my career choices,

7
00:00:21.883 --> 00:00:23.190
professionally and monetarily,

8
00:00:23.190 --> 00:00:27.200
so I want to give you encouragement and confidence as well,

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:32.150
so if you are asked to be a manager, what will you do?

10
00:00:32.150 --> 00:00:35.143
If you have the opportunity for a management role,

11
00:00:35.143 --> 00:00:38.534
go for it and drive forward knowing you have my course as

12
00:00:38.534 --> 00:00:41.816
a guide to navigate the trials of management and I am

13
00:00:41.816 --> 00:00:43.230
here for you to help as well,

14
00:00:43.230 --> 00:00:47.160
so send me an email anytime with questions and I would

15
00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.160
be happy to correspond with you.

16
00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:49.491
Okay,

17
00:00:49.491 --> 00:00:59.000
now let's check out my other Pluralsight courses which make great companion courses with Practical Team Management for Software Engineers.
