1
00:00:00,837 --> 00:00:03,087
Now for my closing thoughts about the wisdom of

2
00:00:03,087 --> 00:00:06,837
listening and the importance of people.

3
00:00:06,837 --> 00:00:10,110
To this point I have been discussing several formal

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:11,637
and informal communication topics.

5
00:00:11,637 --> 00:00:14,837
This is pretty much you communicating to others.

6
00:00:14,837 --> 00:00:19,837
But please remember that you need to do more listening than talking.

7
00:00:19,837 --> 00:00:22,237
And boy that's actually pretty hard.

8
00:00:22,237 --> 00:00:23,837
Good listeners are rare.

9
00:00:23,837 --> 00:00:28,837
I have to constantly remind myself to slow down and listen to others.

10
00:00:28,837 --> 00:00:31,170
Even after all these years of communicating,

11
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:33,980
I personally still need to improve in this area.

12
00:00:33,980 --> 00:00:34,551
In fact,

13
00:00:34,551 --> 00:00:37,480
I used to have a little post-it note behind where people

14
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:40,551
would sit in my office so that while I was talking to them

15
00:00:40,551 --> 00:00:43,051
it reminded me to listen as well.

16
00:00:43,051 --> 00:00:46,473
That helped me remind me to stop talking and listen more.

17
00:00:46,473 --> 00:00:47,837
So give it a try.

18
00:00:47,837 --> 00:00:53,837
Listening effectively takes practice.

19
00:00:53,837 --> 00:00:56,914
"Wisdom is the reward you get for a lifetime of

20
00:00:56,914 --> 00:01:00,337
listening when you would rather have talked.

21
00:01:00,337 --> 00:01:02,837
" - Mark Twain.

22
00:01:02,837 --> 00:01:04,087
It's a great quote.

23
00:01:04,087 --> 00:01:09,170
The point of this slide is that if you can be patient and listen to others,

24
00:01:09,170 --> 00:01:11,837
there are several rewards, people will respect you,

25
00:01:11,837 --> 00:01:14,504
appreciate you, and be more loyal to you,

26
00:01:14,504 --> 00:01:18,920
and as a bonus you will have learned so much more about

27
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,837
them and the topic they're talking about.

28
00:01:21,837 --> 00:01:25,837
Okay now let's see what business is all about.

29
00:01:25,837 --> 00:01:28,837
Do you have any ideas?

30
00:01:28,837 --> 00:01:32,587
What this all comes down to is that business is about people,

31
00:01:32,587 --> 00:01:35,655
it always has been and always will be.

32
00:01:35,655 --> 00:01:37,928
Too often businesses fall short,

33
00:01:37,928 --> 00:01:41,019
not because the leaders don't understand the business,

34
00:01:41,019 --> 00:01:42,837
they usually do quite well,

35
00:01:42,837 --> 00:01:46,529
but because they don't understand what the people who work for them

36
00:01:46,529 --> 00:01:48,837
need in order to bring their best effort to work.

37
00:01:48,837 --> 00:01:52,837
This is your challenge, it will not be easy.

38
00:01:52,837 --> 00:01:57,551
But now that you are aware of it, you can make a difference, and I know you can.

39
00:01:57,551 --> 00:02:01,837
Okay, let's summarize this module.

40
00:02:01,837 --> 00:02:03,337
So here's a recap of the module.

41
00:02:03,337 --> 00:02:05,670
Now first we talked about some informal communication methods,

42
00:02:05,670 --> 00:02:09,420
such as stand ups, those are the real quick,

43
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:10,694
yep you're standing up,

44
00:02:10,694 --> 00:02:15,170
maybe 3 or 4 or 5 people in a conference room or a corner somewhere,

45
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:17,837
just doing hey here's what I did yesterday,

46
00:02:17,837 --> 00:02:22,837
here's what I plan to do today and the issues and around you go.

47
00:02:22,837 --> 00:02:26,837
There are also the walk arounds, this is where you got up and walked around,

48
00:02:26,837 --> 00:02:28,670
maybe you went to the kitchen or went somewhere and you

49
00:02:28,670 --> 00:02:31,299
stopped and you poked your head into an office,

50
00:02:31,299 --> 00:02:33,529
try not to bother anybody, a quick hello,

51
00:02:33,529 --> 00:02:35,837
good morning, how's it going, what'd you do last weekend,

52
00:02:35,837 --> 00:02:37,837
how's this project going, things like that.

53
00:02:37,837 --> 00:02:42,837
Real quick, real informal, nothing big issue wise or anything like that,

54
00:02:42,837 --> 00:02:47,837
just a hello, I recognize you're there, I recognize you're working hard,

55
00:02:47,837 --> 00:02:48,837
how are you doing?

56
00:02:48,837 --> 00:02:50,837
And of course, informal emails, which are fine,

57
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:55,068
but again the point of this communication module is on the

58
00:02:55,068 --> 00:02:58,110
formal emails compared to the informal emails.

59
00:02:58,110 --> 00:03:00,837
So use informal emails sparingly please.

60
00:03:00,837 --> 00:03:03,837
And just plain daily interactions, what are all the things you do,

61
00:03:03,837 --> 00:03:06,694
your behaviors, the way you hold your body,

62
00:03:06,694 --> 00:03:09,299
the way you talk to people, your voice,

63
00:03:09,299 --> 00:03:12,504
your mannerisms and how you get around and get along with everyone,

64
00:03:12,504 --> 00:03:15,837
that's important, people are watching.

65
00:03:15,837 --> 00:03:16,299
Formal.

66
00:03:16,299 --> 00:03:22,087
Okay we had several ways to communicate with formal and that is presentations,

67
00:03:22,087 --> 00:03:25,564
you've going to have to be able to develop and deliver quality presentations,

68
00:03:25,564 --> 00:03:27,382
have your outcome in mind,

69
00:03:27,382 --> 00:03:30,837
so you can put together the slides just in the way

70
00:03:30,837 --> 00:03:32,837
you need to get what you want.

71
00:03:32,837 --> 00:03:37,837
Know who your audience is going to be so you can deliver the best presentation.

72
00:03:37,837 --> 00:03:39,837
Next would be meetings, lots of different kinds of meetings.

73
00:03:39,837 --> 00:03:42,337
So meet with your customers, you meet with your managers,

74
00:03:42,337 --> 00:03:45,237
you meet with your team or maybe individually,

75
00:03:45,237 --> 00:03:48,337
you'll do performance reviews, you might meet with suppliers,

76
00:03:48,337 --> 00:03:50,382
consultants, lots of different meeting forums,

77
00:03:50,382 --> 00:03:53,110
each must have an agenda,

78
00:03:53,110 --> 00:03:56,746
you will lead those meetings and you'll come up with

79
00:03:56,746 --> 00:03:57,837
action items and things like that.

80
00:03:57,837 --> 00:04:00,587
Then you're going to have your follow up email that'll talk

81
00:04:00,587 --> 00:04:02,473
about everything that happened in the meeting,

82
00:04:02,473 --> 00:04:04,746
notes, action items and things like that.

83
00:04:04,746 --> 00:04:06,564
That's very, very important.

84
00:04:06,564 --> 00:04:08,837
We talked about formal emails.

85
00:04:08,837 --> 00:04:12,137
And that the TO: is who you want it to go to from the sense of I

86
00:04:12,137 --> 00:04:14,837
want them to read it and give me feedback.

87
00:04:14,837 --> 00:04:17,019
The CC: are more informational only.

88
00:04:17,019 --> 00:04:21,123
The Subject is important because we want it to be clear and concise,

89
00:04:21,123 --> 00:04:21,980
easy to read,

90
00:04:21,980 --> 00:04:25,837
easy to understand and also a little compelling so they'll click and open it.

91
00:04:25,837 --> 00:04:27,337
And we had a template for the body,

92
00:04:27,337 --> 00:04:29,837
and I suggested to you that you use that template for every

93
00:04:29,837 --> 00:04:33,375
single formal email and then just tweak it or add or subtract

94
00:04:33,375 --> 00:04:36,837
some things from that to make it your own.

95
00:04:36,837 --> 00:04:37,337
Next, status reporting.

96
00:04:37,337 --> 00:04:40,201
I know that's a tough one, most people hate writing status reports,

97
00:04:40,201 --> 00:04:44,991
but it is extremely important, especially to your customers that you do that,

98
00:04:44,991 --> 00:04:48,337
so they see a consistent message from you and that you're on the ball.

99
00:04:48,337 --> 00:04:50,694
You're going to talk about progress, what you did,

100
00:04:50,694 --> 00:04:53,837
plans, what you're going to do, and any problems or issues,

101
00:04:53,837 --> 00:04:58,837
so everything is transparent and your customer knows exactly what's going on.

102
00:04:58,837 --> 00:05:01,908
Of course we also talked about listening and that's a tough one, as I mentioned.

103
00:05:01,908 --> 00:05:02,980
Try to listen.

104
00:05:02,980 --> 00:05:05,837
You know, next time you're in a meeting,

105
00:05:05,837 --> 00:05:08,837
especially one on one, see how long you can go within talking.

106
00:05:08,837 --> 00:05:10,551
That's not easy.

107
00:05:10,551 --> 00:05:12,837
Practice better listening skills.

108
00:05:12,837 --> 00:05:15,694
And lastly, read my lips, "it's all about the people,

109
00:05:15,694 --> 00:05:18,504
" people are what makes the world go round,

110
00:05:18,504 --> 00:05:20,837
makes the professional environment what it is,

111
00:05:20,837 --> 00:05:25,837
and it is extremely rewarding to have that relationship with people.

112
00:05:25,837 --> 00:05:29,837
Build that relationship, trust them, get them to trust you as well.

113
00:05:29,837 --> 00:05:30,123
Alright,

114
00:05:30,123 --> 00:05:34,551
now in the next module we're going to discuss the key and critical processes you

115
00:05:34,551 --> 00:05:41,000
need to have in place to run a smooth and productive team. See you there.
