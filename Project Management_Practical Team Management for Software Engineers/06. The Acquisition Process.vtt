00:00:00.491 --> 00:00:01.855
The acquisition process.

2
00:00:01.855 --> 00:00:06.260
We have now defined our requirements for the new person.

3
00:00:06.260 --> 00:00:10.106
Here is the process I would suggest you follow to

4
00:00:10.106 --> 00:00:15.491
acquire your new talent in six easy steps.

5
00:00:15.491 --> 00:00:18.408
First off, always follow your company's process,

6
00:00:18.408 --> 00:00:22.673
so talk to your manager and/or HR, human resources,

7
00:00:22.673 --> 00:00:26.491
to learn and understand the hiring process.

8
00:00:26.491 --> 00:00:29.491
I am never suggesting you go around the company process.

9
00:00:29.491 --> 00:00:31.891
In the event that you do not have a process or the

10
00:00:31.891 --> 00:00:37.491
process allows you to be creative, here are the steps I recommend.

11
00:00:37.491 --> 00:00:41.491
If you don't think about what you need in a new employee ahead of time,

12
00:00:41.491 --> 00:00:45.491
you will have a much harder time knowing when you find him or her,

13
00:00:45.491 --> 00:00:47.414
so follow my simple process.

14
00:00:47.414 --> 00:00:51.047
Step 1, since we have our job requirements completed,

15
00:00:51.047 --> 00:00:54.935
we post your requirements either through using

16
00:00:54.935 --> 00:00:57.574
existing company practices or on Indeed,

17
00:00:57.574 --> 00:01:00.491
LinkedIn or other social or business portals.

18
00:01:00.491 --> 00:01:01.414
By the way,

19
00:01:01.414 --> 00:01:04.713
I will be going through very detailed examples of each one

20
00:01:04.713 --> 00:01:06.491
of my six steps in the following slides.

21
00:01:06.491 --> 00:01:08.891
This is an overview.

22
00:01:08.891 --> 00:01:12.491
Next, step 2, conduct phone interviews.

23
00:01:12.491 --> 00:01:16.491
As you're responses come in, rank them against your requirements,

24
00:01:16.491 --> 00:01:20.491
believe me, you will get some that aren't even close to what you need,

25
00:01:20.491 --> 00:01:22.158
no worries, that is expected.

26
00:01:22.158 --> 00:01:25.414
Now when you find the right candidates that even come close,

27
00:01:25.414 --> 00:01:29.799
remember no one walks on water, then put them in the phone interview pile.

28
00:01:29.799 --> 00:01:33.491
Next step 3, conduct face to face interviews.

29
00:01:33.491 --> 00:01:34.876
If they satisfy your phone interview,

30
00:01:34.876 --> 00:01:39.491
then set up a time for them to come into your office for an interview.

31
00:01:39.491 --> 00:01:41.764
Step 4, follow on interviews.

32
00:01:41.764 --> 00:01:46.553
Usually one interview is not enough and you may need to do a deep dive and ask

33
00:01:46.553 --> 00:01:49.991
some more deep and interesting and provocative questions.

34
00:01:49.991 --> 00:01:52.491
Step 5, selection.

35
00:01:52.491 --> 00:01:56.260
Okay, now you need to pick one.

36
00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.491
And lastly, step 6, finalize paperwork.

37
00:01:59.491 --> 00:02:03.855
You're going to have to go to HR or other company paperwork processes to

38
00:02:03.855 --> 00:02:07.491
actually make this happen and get the offer letter out.

39
00:02:07.491 --> 00:02:12.491
Now let's prepare for our first interview.

40
00:02:12.491 --> 00:02:15.183
Step 1, post job and collect candidates,

41
00:02:15.183 --> 00:02:18.946
that is you are collecting resumes from the posting sources.

42
00:02:18.946 --> 00:02:20.764
You already have your requirements,

43
00:02:20.764 --> 00:02:24.348
so this step will be pretty easy and you're done.

44
00:02:24.348 --> 00:02:28.891
Next, post the job with HR or online sites and employment services.

45
00:02:28.891 --> 00:02:30.491
Next, screen the candidates,

46
00:02:30.491 --> 00:02:34.491
screen their resumes to the ones that make sense to talk to.

47
00:02:34.491 --> 00:02:37.491
Create a list of the candidates you would like to call.

48
00:02:37.491 --> 00:02:39.777
You may get a ton, read each one,

49
00:02:39.777 --> 00:02:44.491
and use your judgment which ones you want to call based on the requirements.

50
00:02:44.491 --> 00:02:46.491
Sometimes you might find they don't meet the requirements on paper,

51
00:02:46.491 --> 00:02:47.491
so to speak,

52
00:02:47.491 --> 00:02:50.824
but other experiences on their resume might give you a

53
00:02:50.824 --> 00:02:53.358
gut feel to move them to the next step.

54
00:02:53.358 --> 00:02:57.158
So watch out for the resumes that don't quite meet your requirements,

55
00:02:57.158 --> 00:03:02.414
but still look intriguing and may offer value you have not thought of.

56
00:03:02.414 --> 00:03:05.491
Don't settle for less, at least not yet.

57
00:03:05.491 --> 00:03:08.491
If you only have subpar candidates, well keep looking.

58
00:03:08.491 --> 00:03:11.876
The last thing you want is to hire someone you really

59
00:03:11.876 --> 00:03:14.741
don't want or just can't do the job.

60
00:03:14.741 --> 00:03:16.991
That new hire, by the way,

61
00:03:16.991 --> 00:03:21.408
will consume your time and be a morale killer to others.

62
00:03:21.408 --> 00:03:23.491
Review results with your team.

63
00:03:23.491 --> 00:03:25.568
Always be inclusive with your team, share your findings,

64
00:03:25.568 --> 00:03:30.491
and now that you have a list of say five candidates for in person interviews.

65
00:03:30.491 --> 00:03:32.673
Next, keep all documentation and notes.

66
00:03:32.673 --> 00:03:36.337
I'll keep hammering on this, this is very important.

67
00:03:36.337 --> 00:03:36.799
Lastly,

68
00:03:36.799 --> 00:03:45.491
our outcome of the step is a list of qualified candidates to call on the phone.

69
00:03:45.491 --> 00:03:49.491
Okay, now let's call them.

70
00:03:49.491 --> 00:03:53.491
Okay step 2, conduct the phone interviews.

71
00:03:53.491 --> 00:03:56.260
The whole point of the phone interview is to see if they

72
00:03:56.260 --> 00:03:58.991
qualify for a face to face interview.

73
00:03:58.991 --> 00:04:02.741
Remember, face to face interviews takes much more time and money,

74
00:04:02.741 --> 00:04:07.158
so we want to use the phone interview as a tool to prequalify the candidates.

75
00:04:07.158 --> 00:04:08.408
In other words,

76
00:04:08.408 --> 00:04:13.824
what are the minimum things you need to know in order to either end the

77
00:04:13.824 --> 00:04:16.991
call and say thanks or move them to the next step,

78
00:04:16.991 --> 00:04:18.491
which is the in person interview.

79
00:04:18.491 --> 00:04:19.741
Now be patient.

80
00:04:19.741 --> 00:04:23.491
Don't jump to a face-to-face right now, have patience.

81
00:04:23.491 --> 00:04:28.205
If you go right to face-to-face, I've found over time it just wastes your time.

82
00:04:28.205 --> 00:04:33.260
This step is important to save your time and the interviewee's time as well.

83
00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:37.491
Prepare a list of questions that will enable you to quickly,

84
00:04:37.491 --> 00:04:39.624
maybe in 15 minutes to 30 minutes tops,

85
00:04:39.624 --> 00:04:42.106
to know whether you want to proceed with them.

86
00:04:42.106 --> 00:04:44.876
Remember the goal of the phone interview is this,

87
00:04:44.876 --> 00:04:50.491
do they meet your threshold of requirements for an in person interview?

88
00:04:50.491 --> 00:04:53.491
What are the got to have requirements?

89
00:04:53.491 --> 00:04:56.491
Have a list of deal breaker questions.

90
00:04:56.491 --> 00:04:59.876
Don't waste your time or the time of the respondent with

91
00:04:59.876 --> 00:05:03.491
random questions or plain chit chat, get right down to it.

92
00:05:03.491 --> 00:05:07.491
Okay, conduct a phone interview and take notes.

93
00:05:07.491 --> 00:05:08.491
So start calling.

94
00:05:08.491 --> 00:05:11.491
Begin with pleasantries and be upbeat in your demeanor.

95
00:05:11.491 --> 00:05:14.741
Begin with - may I ask you a few questions and then move

96
00:05:14.741 --> 00:05:16.491
on with your deal breaker questions.

97
00:05:16.491 --> 00:05:18.824
If enough are answered to your liking,

98
00:05:18.824 --> 00:05:22.824
they will become a candidate for an in person interview,

99
00:05:22.824 --> 00:05:24.491
if not, they're out.

100
00:05:24.491 --> 00:05:26.953
Ask clear and concise questions that tie specifically

101
00:05:26.953 --> 00:05:29.047
to those got to have requirements.

102
00:05:29.047 --> 00:05:33.491
You want to get down to specifics quickly.

103
00:05:33.491 --> 00:05:36.634
No need for vague or fuzzy questions on a phone interview,

104
00:05:36.634 --> 00:05:39.029
maybe leave that for the face to face.

105
00:05:39.029 --> 00:05:41.491
Here's some examples of maybe got to haves.

106
00:05:41.491 --> 00:05:44.673
For example, I need 3+ years of.

107
00:05:44.673 --> 00:05:46.491
NET or C# experience.

108
00:05:46.491 --> 00:05:49.491
I may need a 4 year degree, maybe computer related.

109
00:05:49.491 --> 00:05:51.991
Also, salary expectations, this is important,

110
00:05:51.991 --> 00:05:55.414
if they want twice what you can budget for,

111
00:05:55.414 --> 00:05:59.414
you might consider moving on since neither one of you will be satisfied.

112
00:05:59.414 --> 00:06:05.491
Of course this is just a short list and your got to haves will be much longer.

113
00:06:05.491 --> 00:06:08.491
Next, review the results with your team.

114
00:06:08.491 --> 00:06:12.491
Always be inclusive with your team and share your findings.

115
00:06:12.491 --> 00:06:12.705
Okay,

116
00:06:12.705 --> 00:06:15.277
now that you have a list of say maybe three to five

117
00:06:15.277 --> 00:06:19.491
candidates for in person interviews, let's see what your team thinks.

118
00:06:19.491 --> 00:06:23.491
Also, keep all documentation and notes, you never know.

119
00:06:23.491 --> 00:06:28.491
In today's corporate and litigious world, you may need your notes, so keep them.

120
00:06:28.491 --> 00:06:32.491
So now that we have our phone interviews complete or maybe even most of them,

121
00:06:32.491 --> 00:06:35.029
and we have a short list of in person interview candidates,

122
00:06:35.029 --> 00:06:39.491
we can move to the next step, which is the face to face interview.

123
00:06:39.491 --> 00:06:43.491
So the outcome of this step is a list of qualified candidates,

124
00:06:43.491 --> 00:06:44.991
they've met your got to haves,

125
00:06:44.991 --> 00:06:54.000
now they can move on to the face to face interviews. Now if you don't have any, keep on looking.
