1
00:00:01,729 --> 00:00:05,729
In the last section we talked about the acquisition process for new talent.

2
00:00:05,729 --> 00:00:07,114
And in that section we talked about, of course,

3
00:00:07,114 --> 00:00:08,498
you're going to ask some questions.

4
00:00:08,498 --> 00:00:12,344
Now it's time to actually talk about how do we

5
00:00:12,344 --> 00:00:14,062
prepare and design your questions.

6
00:00:14,062 --> 00:00:17,929
You want to ask questions that will enable the interviewee to demonstrate

7
00:00:17,929 --> 00:00:22,129
their capabilities and qualities to you and your team.

8
00:00:22,129 --> 00:00:27,729
Alright, let's get started in this section.

9
00:00:27,729 --> 00:00:31,729
Again I just want to emphasize that it's not all about technical skills,

10
00:00:31,729 --> 00:00:36,729
but also about communication and leadership strengths as well.

11
00:00:36,729 --> 00:00:39,429
Sometimes I use the term interpersonal skills to also

12
00:00:39,429 --> 00:00:40,618
represent communication skills.

13
00:00:40,618 --> 00:00:45,229
Interpersonal skills can be an enormous strength to your team,

14
00:00:45,229 --> 00:00:49,229
especially with the customer, especially with requirements gathering,

15
00:00:49,229 --> 00:00:52,729
especially with negotiating and things like that.

16
00:00:52,729 --> 00:00:55,479
So we want a collection of questions that will enable the

17
00:00:55,479 --> 00:00:58,396
interviewee to clearly demonstrate to you and your team,

18
00:00:58,396 --> 00:01:02,015
not only their technical, but also their communication,

19
00:01:02,015 --> 00:01:03,729
leadership, interpersonal skills,

20
00:01:03,729 --> 00:01:10,729
based on your requirements list that we put together in previous sections.

21
00:01:10,729 --> 00:01:12,729
To assess the interviewee's technical capabilities,

22
00:01:12,729 --> 00:01:15,729
I would suggest something like the following.

23
00:01:15,729 --> 00:01:18,729
I would provide a written test.

24
00:01:18,729 --> 00:01:20,806
For example, if you're looking for a database person,

25
00:01:20,806 --> 00:01:24,507
you may have a list of questions about SQL,

26
00:01:24,507 --> 00:01:26,729
database design, database administration,

27
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:30,729
and features of Microsoft SQL Server, for example.

28
00:01:30,729 --> 00:01:33,729
Now a written test enables the objective scoring and

29
00:01:33,729 --> 00:01:34,979
comparing to other candidates.

30
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,267
This approach makes it pretty easy to see how the person did on the questions,

31
00:01:39,267 --> 00:01:42,729
where they were strong and where they were weak,

32
00:01:42,729 --> 00:01:45,729
and allows you to more easily compare candidates.

33
00:01:45,729 --> 00:01:50,344
A test may also include a programming example or an example of

34
00:01:50,344 --> 00:01:55,344
actually using a tool or platform to get something done or

35
00:01:55,344 --> 00:01:57,062
accomplish a predetermined outcome.

36
00:01:57,062 --> 00:01:59,396
For example, continue with the SQL example,

37
00:01:59,396 --> 00:02:05,093
maybe they have to perform a complex joint operation between multiple tables,

38
00:02:05,093 --> 00:02:06,729
things like that.

39
00:02:06,729 --> 00:02:10,729
So they can really literally demonstrate their skills.

40
00:02:10,729 --> 00:02:13,191
Some people are pretty good at taking tests,

41
00:02:13,191 --> 00:02:14,114
A, B, C,

42
00:02:14,114 --> 00:02:18,114
answering questions and things like that and the real test would be actually

43
00:02:18,114 --> 00:02:24,729
getting them to perform an actual series of operations.

44
00:02:24,729 --> 00:02:27,840
To assess the interviewee's communication capabilities I

45
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:30,729
would suggest something like the following.

46
00:02:30,729 --> 00:02:36,729
Have you developed presentations for senior management or important customers?

47
00:02:36,729 --> 00:02:37,729
If the answer is no,

48
00:02:37,729 --> 00:02:40,729
then you know they may be a little weak in presentation skills.

49
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:45,872
Now in our scenario of our requirements, presentation skills was a requirement.

50
00:02:45,872 --> 00:02:49,729
Now if they answer yes, then you need to ask follow up questions,

51
00:02:49,729 --> 00:02:54,093
otherwise you really haven't a clue to how good those skills were,

52
00:02:54,093 --> 00:02:55,911
and here they are.

53
00:02:55,911 --> 00:02:57,729
Who was your audience?

54
00:02:57,729 --> 00:02:59,806
This will give you a feel for the composition,

55
00:02:59,806 --> 00:03:01,498
how senior or important were they.

56
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:05,729
What was the situation that caused you to give the presentation?

57
00:03:05,729 --> 00:03:10,618
Maybe it was a project status or results of research or something like that.

58
00:03:10,618 --> 00:03:13,729
What was the intended outcome you wanted?

59
00:03:13,729 --> 00:03:15,547
This is an important question.

60
00:03:15,547 --> 00:03:20,129
I strongly believe that every presentation should have a clear intended outcome.

61
00:03:20,129 --> 00:03:23,093
And does the interviewee understand that and were they

62
00:03:23,093 --> 00:03:25,229
successful in doing that during their presentation?

63
00:03:25,229 --> 00:03:28,729
Did you achieve the outcome you wanted?

64
00:03:28,729 --> 00:03:31,037
This may give you some insights into their ability to

65
00:03:31,037 --> 00:03:35,729
convey and communicate successfully.

66
00:03:35,729 --> 00:03:38,396
To assess the interviewee's leadership capabilities I would

67
00:03:38,396 --> 00:03:40,329
suggest something like the following,

68
00:03:40,329 --> 00:03:44,883
one of your team members' deliverables are not what you expected and the

69
00:03:44,883 --> 00:03:48,729
quality was not what you wantedâ€¦ what was your course of action?

70
00:03:48,729 --> 00:03:50,729
How did they approach this situation?

71
00:03:50,729 --> 00:03:52,292
Let me talk about that.

72
00:03:52,292 --> 00:03:56,285
Did they go for a quick fix or show more leadership qualities?

73
00:03:56,285 --> 00:04:00,729
That's what you're really looking for, leadership qualities.

74
00:04:00,729 --> 00:04:05,729
Did they have a corrective action plan to help the person improve over time?

75
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:06,960
And things like that.

76
00:04:06,960 --> 00:04:11,729
So you can see in these three different areas in terms of technical,

77
00:04:11,729 --> 00:04:15,498
communication, and leadership, we had some key questions,

78
00:04:15,498 --> 00:04:18,575
and you'll want to follow up with two,

79
00:04:18,575 --> 00:04:24,729
three or four other questions to have in your hip pocket so you can dig deeper.

80
00:04:24,729 --> 00:04:26,417
You know, you don't want yes or no answers,

81
00:04:26,417 --> 00:04:27,729
you want to get them to talk,

82
00:04:27,729 --> 00:04:31,365
you want to get them to expose their interpersonal skills,

83
00:04:31,365 --> 00:04:35,365
their personalities and their capabilities so you can see

84
00:04:35,365 --> 00:04:37,960
them demonstrate those in front of you.

85
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:47,000
Now let's move on to a couple other attributes that we want to look for that I think are also very important during the interview.
