00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Hello, I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.636
I will be presenting the module Promoting Productivity

3
00:00:07.636 --> 00:00:12.333
Through Team Processes in the course Practical Team

4
00:00:12.333 --> 00:00:15.000
Management for Software Engineers.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.444
Now here's a good quote, "if you can't describe what you're doing as a processâ€¦.

6
00:00:20.444 --> 00:00:23.556
well you don't know what you're doing.

7
00:00:23.556 --> 00:00:25.846
" That's a great quote by Mr.

8
00:00:25.846 --> 00:00:26.154
Deming.

9
00:00:26.154 --> 00:00:26.462
Remember,

10
00:00:26.462 --> 00:00:30.909
if you do not define your required processes to perform the team's work,

11
00:00:30.909 --> 00:00:35.182
things will happen randomly or haphazardly and are difficult to

12
00:00:35.182 --> 00:00:37.923
repeat consistently or to teach new hires.

13
00:00:37.923 --> 00:00:38.846
This is inefficient.

14
00:00:38.846 --> 00:00:42.071
Now when I mean you need to define the processes,

15
00:00:42.071 --> 00:00:47.000
what I really mean is for you to lead and facilitate the defining,

16
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:51.714
documenting, using, and measuring of the processes with your team,

17
00:00:51.714 --> 00:00:55.643
and maybe reach out to other subject matter experts in your

18
00:00:55.643 --> 00:00:58.692
company or even external consultants to do this.

19
00:00:58.692 --> 00:01:02.667
So we have talked and discussed about many management activities that

20
00:01:02.667 --> 00:01:06.154
you must perform in your new role as a manager.

21
00:01:06.154 --> 00:01:10.889
Now let's talk further about the rest of the processes you will

22
00:01:10.889 --> 00:01:14.000
need to support the development of systems.

23
00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000
Okay now let's do a quick recap since we already have some processes

24
00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000
under our belt and in place from the previous modules.

25
00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000
The first, the process is for aligning IT activities to the business.

26
00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000
Then we talked about the processes for managing customer expectations.

27
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.091
Next, the processes for building team structure and capabilities,

28
00:01:35.091 --> 00:01:39.000
and lastly the processes for acquiring the right talent.

29
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.500
These processes indirectly, if you will, support your team in creating software.

30
00:01:42.500 --> 00:01:48.250
Now let's move on to processes that are more directly tied to

31
00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:50.000
the actual writing of software and systems,

32
00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000
that's what this module is all about.

33
00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.571
Okay here is the line up for this module.

34
00:01:56.571 --> 00:02:00.692
First the importance of process in your new role as a manager.

35
00:02:00.692 --> 00:02:02.231
Then managing your processes,

36
00:02:02.231 --> 00:02:07.000
that is you will need a process by which to manage your processes.

37
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.923
Don't worry this is easy.

38
00:02:08.923 --> 00:02:14.143
Next, of course, is the 10 key processes, the core of this module.

39
00:02:14.143 --> 00:02:18.615
I have identified 10 key processes to get you jump started.

40
00:02:18.615 --> 00:02:23.071
Now maybe you only want to start with some of them, that's okay too.

41
00:02:23.071 --> 00:02:26.286
For me though, all work, I'll say it again,

42
00:02:26.286 --> 00:02:30.000
all work must be covered by a process and why is that?

43
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.933
If you can't describe what you are doing as a process,

44
00:02:32.933 --> 00:02:34.800
then you don't know what you're doing.

45
00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:37.200
So when I do my process audits for clients,

46
00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:42.000
I walk up to a developer and say, how do you promote your builds to production,

47
00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:42.667
for example,

48
00:02:42.667 --> 00:02:46.727
and they better answer that they follow a written process or checklist.

49
00:02:46.727 --> 00:02:50.429
It is understandable and known by each team member and

50
00:02:50.429 --> 00:02:53.000
we improve the process as needed.

51
00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:59.000
Okay, that's an A+ in my book. Let's get started.
