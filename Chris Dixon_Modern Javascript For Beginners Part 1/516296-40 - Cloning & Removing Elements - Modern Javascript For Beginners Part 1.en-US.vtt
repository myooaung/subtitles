00:00:02.330 --> 00:00:05.160
Let's kick off this video by looking at

00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.665
cloning elements, which we already have.

00:00:07.665 --> 00:00:10.305
The starter files in cloning and removing

00:00:10.305 --> 00:00:14.160
elements will have the same setup as the previous video.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:18.210
Go down to the bottom and just below this comment here,

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:20.040
the first thing we need to do to clone

00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:22.210
an element is to actually select one.

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.435
You can choose any element which you want.

00:00:24.435 --> 00:00:26.880
But for simplicity, I'm going to use one of

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.410
the button elements which you already

00:00:28.410 --> 00:00:31.300
have. Let's select this.

00:00:32.720 --> 00:00:35.410
Now on this button element node,

00:00:35.410 --> 00:00:38.410
we can call a method called clone node,

00:00:38.410 --> 00:00:41.195
add the brackets and install this

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:44.550
inside of a variable called clone button.

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.910
Now, if we save this and go over to the browser into

00:00:49.910 --> 00:00:51.440
the developer tools with right-click and

00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:54.240
inspect into the console.

00:00:54.240 --> 00:00:56.405
Now using this variable name,

00:00:56.405 --> 00:01:01.700
type this inside the browser, it's uncertain.

00:01:01.700 --> 00:01:04.595
We now get returned back to visit this button element.

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:06.440
If we look closely between this button,

00:01:06.440 --> 00:01:10.235
we don't see any of the contents such as the text inside.

00:01:10.235 --> 00:01:13.340
You can look to the button, you can see here we created

00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:15.260
the text node buy online and

00:01:15.260 --> 00:01:17.935
then we appended this to our button.

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:20.620
By default, we use clone nodes,

00:01:20.620 --> 00:01:23.005
it will only clone the element nodes

00:01:23.005 --> 00:01:26.000
and not any of the content nested inside.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.615
If we did want the contents inside,

00:01:28.615 --> 00:01:31.855
we need to pass in a Boolean value of true.

00:01:31.855 --> 00:01:35.065
This will then copy all the contents from inside.

00:01:35.065 --> 00:01:37.255
We can see this, if we once again type

00:01:37.255 --> 00:01:39.825
our clone button, hit Enter.

00:01:39.825 --> 00:01:43.105
We now have the text content from inside.

00:01:43.105 --> 00:01:46.150
One thing to watch out for when cloning is if we are

00:01:46.150 --> 00:01:49.390
cloning an element which has a unique ID,

00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:52.060
with IDs we always want them to be unique.

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:55.225
We don't want to have two elements with the same value.

00:01:55.225 --> 00:01:58.915
Also, here we've only created this button element.

00:01:58.915 --> 00:02:01.450
We have not yet added this to the DOM.

00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:04.630
Let's now take a look at how we can remove elements using

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:08.820
a method called remove child comments, I'll just clone.

00:02:08.820 --> 00:02:11.250
The remove method is pretty simple.

00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:14.680
All we need to do is to select our node, scroll up.

00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:16.060
For this example, I'm going to

00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:18.185
remove the section heading,

00:02:18.185 --> 00:02:20.130
the section heading is a level

00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:21.760
3 heading which was created here,

00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:24.250
installed inside of this variable.

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:29.950
Select this. The first method

00:02:29.950 --> 00:02:32.010
we'll take a look at is remove,

00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:34.880
take this, and this is the heading just here.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.430
If we refresh this,

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.835
the heading has now been removed.

00:02:38.835 --> 00:02:41.470
Also in addition to this remove method,

00:02:41.470 --> 00:02:44.215
we can also do this on the parent.

00:02:44.215 --> 00:02:46.780
But if we scroll up to our HTML,

00:02:46.780 --> 00:02:49.590
if we take a look for our level 3 heading,

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.345
here, we can see that the parent is this section.

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:55.520
Then scrolling down to our JavaScript

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:56.915
where we actually create this,

00:02:56.915 --> 00:02:59.480
we have a reference to this section called section

00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:03.060
wrapper. This is the parents.

00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:07.710
Let's comment this out. Grab the section wrapper,

00:03:07.710 --> 00:03:09.795
we'll call it the remove child method.

00:03:09.795 --> 00:03:11.465
Then we place inside a reference,

00:03:11.465 --> 00:03:14.090
the child element which you want to remove.

00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:15.830
The child element which is nested

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:18.840
inside is this section heading.

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.435
Now, if we save this and refresh the browser,

00:03:23.435 --> 00:03:25.040
we can see that the section heading

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.300
has still been removed.

00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:29.680
But this time just done in a slightly different way.

00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:32.960
By now you should be starting to get a good grasp of how

00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:35.695
we can use JavaScript to interact with the DOM.

00:03:35.695 --> 00:03:38.765
A lot of these processes follow a similar pattern.

00:03:38.765 --> 00:03:40.660
We normally have to select an element,

00:03:40.660 --> 00:03:42.380
we can store them in a variable.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:45.950
Then we call a method to perform a certain action.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:48.380
We can do things like remove elements.

00:03:48.380 --> 00:03:50.390
We can add one element whenever.

00:03:50.390 --> 00:03:53.210
We can create and modify elements to construct

00:03:53.210 --> 00:03:56.515
our HTML exactly how we want it to be.

00:03:56.515 --> 00:03:59.240
Coming up next, you'll have the chance to put all of this

00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:02.520
into practice with a mini challenge.
