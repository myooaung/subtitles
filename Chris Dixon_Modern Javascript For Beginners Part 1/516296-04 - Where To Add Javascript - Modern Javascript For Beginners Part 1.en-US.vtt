00:00:02.150 --> 00:00:05.490
Welcome to the start of this section.

00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.870
We're now going to take a look at

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:08.610
JavaScript and we're going to move over from

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:12.640
the browser and actually into our own JavaScript files.

00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:14.370
From the previous section,

00:00:14.370 --> 00:00:16.200
we downloaded the starter files

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:17.745
which come with this course.

00:00:17.745 --> 00:00:19.410
If you haven't downloaded these,

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:20.520
make to go back to

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:23.340
that video and download these from GitHub.

00:00:23.340 --> 00:00:26.790
Once this is done, you will need to unzip the package

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:30.855
and drag this into Visual Studio Code to open this up.

00:00:30.855 --> 00:00:32.810
On the right, I've opened up

00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:34.640
Google Chrome as the browser.

00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.635
What we are going to do now is to begin

00:00:36.635 --> 00:00:38.660
right at the start and

00:00:38.660 --> 00:00:40.590
take a look at exactly where we can add

00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:43.085
JavaScript into our files.

00:00:43.085 --> 00:00:44.840
Earlier, we have typed code

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:47.150
directly into the browser's console,

00:00:47.150 --> 00:00:50.330
but realistically, it's almost always wrote

00:00:50.330 --> 00:00:53.925
in our own files. Where do we start?

00:00:53.925 --> 00:00:58.220
Well, inside of Visual Studio Code in our starter files,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:00:59.840
head into our first section,

00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.600
which is the JavaScript basics and you will

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.915
notice that the far numbers begin at 02.

00:01:05.915 --> 00:01:09.095
This is because for this particular lesson,

00:01:09.095 --> 00:01:11.000
we're going to begin right at

00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.360
the start and set things up ourselves,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:15.725
and then for all of the rest of the lessons,

00:01:15.725 --> 00:01:17.120
these will have some boilerplate

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:19.025
available for us to access.

00:01:19.025 --> 00:01:20.390
We can just jump straight

00:01:20.390 --> 00:01:22.930
into writing our JavaScript code.

00:01:22.930 --> 00:01:26.495
For this one with the JavaScript basics selected,

00:01:26.495 --> 00:01:28.130
click on this icon here, which is

00:01:28.130 --> 00:01:29.840
to create a new folder,

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:32.270
and then this can be 01.

00:01:32.270 --> 00:01:35.670
I'm going to call this where to add JavaScript.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.300
Again, make sure this is inside of

00:01:41.300 --> 00:01:43.310
the JavaScript basics folder and

00:01:43.310 --> 00:01:45.845
then with this first folder selected,

00:01:45.845 --> 00:01:47.150
click on this icon here,

00:01:47.150 --> 00:01:48.845
which is a new file,

00:01:48.845 --> 00:01:51.305
and this will open up inside of here.

00:01:51.305 --> 00:01:55.625
We'll call this the index dot HTML.

00:01:55.625 --> 00:02:00.055
Hit Enter. It should be inside of our new folder.

00:02:00.055 --> 00:02:03.730
Within it, add some basic HTML structure to open this up

00:02:03.730 --> 00:02:06.940
inside the browser and Visual Studio Code comes

00:02:06.940 --> 00:02:10.330
with a plug-in or rebuilt in called Emmet This

00:02:10.330 --> 00:02:12.100
will give us some code completion

00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.095
and some simple shortcuts.

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:18.850
One of the most useful ones is HTML colon five.

00:02:18.850 --> 00:02:20.770
Hit Enter. This will give us all of

00:02:20.770 --> 00:02:24.100
the basic HTML starter code which we need.

00:02:24.100 --> 00:02:26.800
Again, this is all going to be available in all of

00:02:26.800 --> 00:02:29.755
the other folders so this is just for this lesson only.

00:02:29.755 --> 00:02:33.770
The title, where to add JavaScript.

00:02:34.010 --> 00:02:36.630
Then we need the elements to actually work

00:02:36.630 --> 00:02:38.790
with such as a page heading.

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:44.770
Placing anything such as h1 and some text inside of here.

00:02:45.140 --> 00:02:48.160
Having these elements in place here means we can use

00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:50.395
some JavaScript to access these elements,

00:02:50.395 --> 00:02:53.050
just like we looked at in the console earlier.

00:02:53.050 --> 00:02:54.910
All you need to open this up

00:02:54.910 --> 00:02:56.620
inside the browser is to save

00:02:56.620 --> 00:02:58.840
this file with Command or Control

00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:02.575
S. Then if we right-click on this filename just here,

00:03:02.575 --> 00:03:05.185
go down to Copy path,

00:03:05.185 --> 00:03:08.815
and then we can paste this inside the browser.

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:10.720
Alternatively, if you want to,

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.495
you can go inside of the main folder just here.

00:03:13.495 --> 00:03:15.820
You can then follow through to the current folder

00:03:15.820 --> 00:03:18.310
and double-click on this index page.

00:03:18.310 --> 00:03:21.950
This will then open this up in your default browser.

00:03:21.950 --> 00:03:25.580
To be able to access these elements using JavaScript,

00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.640
one of the ways we can do this is to add AID.

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.920
I'm going to give us an ID of title.

00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:33.110
Remember that each particular ID should be

00:03:33.110 --> 00:03:35.120
unique to this HTML page.

00:03:35.120 --> 00:03:37.400
Make sure we only have one ID of

00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.180
title inside of this HTML file.

00:03:40.180 --> 00:03:41.600
This makes it nice and easy

00:03:41.600 --> 00:03:42.860
for our JavaScript to be able to

00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:45.800
select the particular elements which you want.

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:50.630
Then below this and just above our closing body tag,

00:03:50.630 --> 00:03:53.690
we can insert our script tags.

00:03:53.690 --> 00:03:59.275
We have an opening tag and also a closing tag too.

00:03:59.275 --> 00:04:01.400
This is the location where we can

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.425
place our JavaScript code.

00:04:03.425 --> 00:04:06.560
Just above the body is one location where we can add

00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:08.435
JavaScript and is also

00:04:08.435 --> 00:04:11.050
over locations which we'll look at soon.

00:04:11.050 --> 00:04:14.340
Earlier when we were inside the console,

00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.745
remember we looked at selecting

00:04:16.745 --> 00:04:20.170
each particular element with dollar symbol zero.

00:04:20.170 --> 00:04:23.710
Also remember we said that this is unique to the console.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:25.610
We need a different way of selecting

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.625
our elements inside of the text editor.

00:04:28.625 --> 00:04:30.140
Well, inside here we're going to do

00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.705
the exact same thing we looked at in the console.

00:04:32.705 --> 00:04:35.450
We will first select the document.

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:38.510
The document is this full HTML document

00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:40.060
which we are currently working in.

00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:43.280
It's going to select this and then we need to filter

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:44.810
down these documents to

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:47.615
the particular element which we want to select.

00:04:47.615 --> 00:04:52.655
Remember we looked at a method called get elements by ID.

00:04:52.655 --> 00:04:54.365
Again, this is CamelCase.

00:04:54.365 --> 00:04:57.215
Each and every word after the first one begins with

00:04:57.215 --> 00:05:00.450
a capital inside the brackets,

00:05:00.450 --> 00:05:02.570
and the quotations will then pass in

00:05:02.570 --> 00:05:05.060
a unique ID which you want to select.

00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:08.315
In our case, we're going to grab the title.

00:05:08.315 --> 00:05:10.400
Move this into here.

00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:13.310
We looked at changing the inner contents or

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:17.265
the inner text of this element with.innertext.

00:05:17.265 --> 00:05:20.240
This is a property where we can add a new text string

00:05:20.240 --> 00:05:23.090
in between the single or the double quotations.

00:05:23.090 --> 00:05:25.070
Let's just change this to JavaScript for

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:27.660
now and save this file.

00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:30.485
Then if we go over to the browser and reload,

00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:32.690
this has now selected our level 1

00:05:32.690 --> 00:05:35.935
heading and changed the inner HTML.

00:05:35.935 --> 00:05:37.980
Let's just close down the side bar

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.810
to get a little bit more space.

00:05:39.810 --> 00:05:43.070
All of the same properties we looked at in

00:05:43.070 --> 00:05:46.160
the console video still apply to,

00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.535
such as adding different styles.

00:05:48.535 --> 00:05:50.180
Again, we can access

00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:53.750
the same elements with get element by ID,

00:05:53.750 --> 00:05:54.980
and we can also change

00:05:54.980 --> 00:05:57.635
the styles for this particular element too.

00:05:57.635 --> 00:06:03.000
Let's change the text color to be equal to orange.

00:06:03.350 --> 00:06:06.510
Refresh and this will all apply.

00:06:06.510 --> 00:06:10.405
Another way of adding JavaScript is to add this inline.

00:06:10.405 --> 00:06:13.700
Adding this inline means we add it directly inside of

00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:15.245
our elements and we add this

00:06:15.245 --> 00:06:17.750
inside of the elements opening tag.

00:06:17.750 --> 00:06:21.505
We'll add this just like we would add some inline CSS.

00:06:21.505 --> 00:06:22.880
In an earlier video,

00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:24.860
we looked at events very briefly,

00:06:24.860 --> 00:06:27.920
where we looked at the on-mouse-over event.

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:31.250
Here, let's take a look at the on-click event,

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:32.780
which will be triggered when the user

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.230
clicks on this particular element.

00:06:35.230 --> 00:06:38.000
All we're going to do inside of this on-click

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.210
event handler is to trigger an alert.

00:06:41.210 --> 00:06:44.330
An alert is a pop-up inside the browser.

00:06:44.330 --> 00:06:48.630
Let's just add this with the text of clicked.

00:06:48.630 --> 00:06:51.615
Give this a save and refresh the browser.

00:06:51.615 --> 00:06:54.485
Move the mouse over to the elements and click.

00:06:54.485 --> 00:06:56.995
I will now see a page alert.

00:06:56.995 --> 00:06:58.760
This is probably something which you've

00:06:58.760 --> 00:07:00.650
seen when browsing the web in the past.

00:07:00.650 --> 00:07:03.560
All we need to do to remove this is to click on

00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:05.480
the Okay button and this will then be

00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.965
closed. Let's just remove this.

00:07:07.965 --> 00:07:10.460
Also just be aware that it is generally

00:07:10.460 --> 00:07:13.040
discouraged to keep our JavaScript in

00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:16.520
line just like this because it mixes up our HTML and

00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:18.140
our JavaScript and makes

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:20.590
things less readable and organized.

00:07:20.590 --> 00:07:22.910
If possible, keep it all separate,

00:07:22.910 --> 00:07:23.980
just like we have here,

00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:25.610
and we'll also look at how we can add this

00:07:25.610 --> 00:07:28.595
into a separate file in just a moment.

00:07:28.595 --> 00:07:31.400
This is contained inside of a script tag and

00:07:31.400 --> 00:07:34.100
we can add as many script tags as you want.

00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:37.565
It could also be located anywhere on this page too,

00:07:37.565 --> 00:07:40.610
including up inside of the head section.

00:07:40.610 --> 00:07:43.490
This works in exactly the same way if we grab all of

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:45.680
this script section and then

00:07:45.680 --> 00:07:49.105
Command or Control X to cut this out of place.

00:07:49.105 --> 00:07:50.570
Place this inside of

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:52.220
the head section with command or control

00:07:52.220 --> 00:07:55.655
V to paste this in and also the browser.

00:07:55.655 --> 00:07:56.870
Inside here we can see

00:07:56.870 --> 00:08:00.535
the original page title is reinstated.

00:08:00.535 --> 00:08:02.255
Now since we've moved

00:08:02.255 --> 00:08:03.995
the script tag up to the head section,

00:08:03.995 --> 00:08:06.860
none of this JavaScript seems to be applying.

00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:08.630
So let's take a look inside

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:11.345
the console and see if we can spot any errors.

00:08:11.345 --> 00:08:13.950
Right-click and inspect.

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.340
Click on the Console tab at the top.

00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:21.550
We see we cannot set the property innertext of null.

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.210
When we do get an error, it's

00:08:23.210 --> 00:08:24.920
often a good idea to head into

00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:26.510
the console and it will often give us

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:29.375
a pointer to exactly what the problem is.

00:08:29.375 --> 00:08:31.250
The current problem is caused because

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:35.240
HTML page is loaded from top to bottom.

00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:38.630
So the script inside of the head section is loaded before

00:08:38.630 --> 00:08:41.914
it even knows this title element exists,

00:08:41.914 --> 00:08:43.970
which is then causing an error.

00:08:43.970 --> 00:08:45.920
If we do need to add a script

00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.630
inside the head section like this,

00:08:47.630 --> 00:08:49.580
it can often cause problems if we need to

00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:52.150
access any of our DOM elements.

00:08:52.150 --> 00:08:54.050
This is why we often see JavaScript

00:08:54.050 --> 00:08:55.805
at the end of the body section.

00:08:55.805 --> 00:08:58.490
It allows the elements to be loaded fast and

00:08:58.490 --> 00:09:01.775
doesn't block the HTML from loading onto the page.

00:09:01.775 --> 00:09:02.870
You will, however,

00:09:02.870 --> 00:09:05.375
see some third-party JavaScript libraries

00:09:05.375 --> 00:09:06.560
which need the script to be

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:08.720
loaded inside the head section

00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.315
for the library to function correctly.

00:09:11.315 --> 00:09:13.385
Also, these third-party libraries,

00:09:13.385 --> 00:09:14.780
along with our own code,

00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.685
is usually separated into its own script file.

00:09:18.685 --> 00:09:22.280
Moving all of this JavaScript into its own file will make

00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:26.430
this HTML documents much more readable and maintainable.

00:09:26.430 --> 00:09:29.465
To do this first, open up the sidebar

00:09:29.465 --> 00:09:33.130
and then inside of the where to add JavaScript folder,

00:09:33.130 --> 00:09:35.200
click on the new file icon,

00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:37.665
and then we can give this a name of our choice.

00:09:37.665 --> 00:09:39.775
I'm going to go for script 1.

00:09:39.775 --> 00:09:44.895
Then it needs to have the dot js extension. Hit Enter.

00:09:44.895 --> 00:09:46.620
Back into our index page,

00:09:46.620 --> 00:09:49.990
we can copy the contents between the script tags.

00:09:49.990 --> 00:09:54.545
Grab these two lines of code, put these outs.

00:09:54.545 --> 00:09:57.985
Paste these into our new script file.

00:09:57.985 --> 00:09:59.710
This script file doesn't need

00:09:59.710 --> 00:10:01.930
the surrounding script tags since we

00:10:01.930 --> 00:10:03.700
already know this is a JavaScript file

00:10:03.700 --> 00:10:06.070
from the dot js extension.

00:10:06.070 --> 00:10:07.825
But what we do need to do is to

00:10:07.825 --> 00:10:09.895
link these two files together.

00:10:09.895 --> 00:10:12.290
Currently, these are two separate files

00:10:12.290 --> 00:10:13.925
independent of each other.

00:10:13.925 --> 00:10:15.380
Over in the index file,

00:10:15.380 --> 00:10:18.050
we need to point to this new script file.

00:10:18.050 --> 00:10:21.410
We can do this inside of the script tags rather

00:10:21.410 --> 00:10:24.695
than having the code located inside like we did before.

00:10:24.695 --> 00:10:28.205
What we can do is to add the source attributes.

00:10:28.205 --> 00:10:30.620
The source attribute is basically

00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:33.110
the location of this file

00:10:33.110 --> 00:10:35.995
relative to where we currently are.

00:10:35.995 --> 00:10:39.890
This works exactly the same as adding a style sheet.

00:10:39.890 --> 00:10:41.990
Since this file is alongside each other,

00:10:41.990 --> 00:10:46.399
we can point to this with the source of script 1 dot js.

00:10:46.399 --> 00:10:48.560
If this was located inside of

00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.360
a JavaScript folder, for example,

00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:51.740
we'll need to go into

00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:53.540
the JavaScript folder and then

00:10:53.540 --> 00:10:56.170
forward slash into our script.

00:10:56.170 --> 00:11:00.125
We don't have this, so it's simply script one dot js.

00:11:00.125 --> 00:11:02.450
Make sure both of our files are saved and

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.075
then over to the browser, refresh.

00:11:05.075 --> 00:11:08.005
we see the same issue inside the browser.

00:11:08.005 --> 00:11:11.520
We can not set the property innertext of null.

00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.060
This makes sense because we are still loading up

00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:16.655
the script tag inside of the head section.

00:11:16.655 --> 00:11:18.260
We're trying to apply this to

00:11:18.260 --> 00:11:20.945
an element before it's even been loaded.

00:11:20.945 --> 00:11:23.030
We could write some custom code to

00:11:23.030 --> 00:11:24.950
wait for the HTML to load first

00:11:24.950 --> 00:11:26.060
or we can look at

00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:29.790
some more modern techniques in the upcoming video.
