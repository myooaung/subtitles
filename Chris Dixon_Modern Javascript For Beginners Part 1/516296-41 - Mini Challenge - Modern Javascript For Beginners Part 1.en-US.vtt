00:00:02.750 --> 00:00:05.400
Welcome to this mini challenge.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.980
What I would like you to do now is to try a few things

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.025
out on your own what you've learned so far.

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:13.200
Pop into this lesson's folder,

00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:14.640
which is the Mini Challenge,

00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:17.215
and then open this up inside the browser.

00:00:17.215 --> 00:00:19.380
You'll see inside the browser that we have

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.720
a new section down at the bottom.

00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:24.120
The task which I would like you to do is

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:26.685
to recreate this section using JavaScript,

00:00:26.685 --> 00:00:29.640
just like we've previously done in the past videos.

00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:32.250
For this challenge, I've also moved over all of

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:36.045
the existing styles into its own dedicated stylesheet.

00:00:36.045 --> 00:00:37.590
Into the index page,

00:00:37.590 --> 00:00:39.360
if we scroll down to the bottom,

00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:42.645
we can see a new section which is this one just here.

00:00:42.645 --> 00:00:45.015
This one has the class of recipes,

00:00:45.015 --> 00:00:47.180
and his is a section which I would like you

00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:49.730
to recreate using JavaScript.

00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:51.530
Once you are done, you can either

00:00:51.530 --> 00:00:53.705
remove this section from the HTML,

00:00:53.705 --> 00:00:56.905
or you can comment out for future reference.

00:00:56.905 --> 00:00:59.915
Since I've already added the styling for this project,

00:00:59.915 --> 00:01:02.000
all you need to do for this to kick in is add

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.360
these classes each one of these elements.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:07.670
This video doesn't have any guidance,

00:01:07.670 --> 00:01:09.410
it's just a chance for you to go and

00:01:09.410 --> 00:01:11.795
put everything you've learned into practice,

00:01:11.795 --> 00:01:14.915
such as creating new elements, creating rappers,

00:01:14.915 --> 00:01:17.330
adding them together, adding class names,

00:01:17.330 --> 00:01:18.830
and if you keep them organized into

00:01:18.830 --> 00:01:20.630
different sections like we did below.

00:01:20.630 --> 00:01:24.020
If you didn't run into any trouble, as you can see,

00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:25.400
I've also kept in place

00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.545
the previous code from the last section,

00:01:27.545 --> 00:01:30.355
so we can use it as a reference if needed.

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:32.820
Give it a try. Good luck and

00:01:32.820 --> 00:01:35.435
remember there is no right or wrong way of doing it.

00:01:35.435 --> 00:01:37.700
The aim is simply to get some practice on your

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.490
own and to replicate this section which we already have.
