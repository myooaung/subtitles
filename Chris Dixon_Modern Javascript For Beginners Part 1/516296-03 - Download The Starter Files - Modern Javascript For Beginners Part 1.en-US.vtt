00:00:03.050 --> 00:00:05.310
Throughout this course, we'll be writing

00:00:05.310 --> 00:00:07.380
a lot of JavaScript code.

00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:09.060
To help us along the way,

00:00:09.060 --> 00:00:11.070
I've provided you with a folder

00:00:11.070 --> 00:00:13.950
called the modern javascript starter files.

00:00:13.950 --> 00:00:19.125
If you head over to github.com/chrisdixon161,

00:00:19.125 --> 00:00:20.850
and then into the repository which

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:23.920
is modern-javascript-starter-files.

00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:28.500
From here, you can download this full set of files,

00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:30.680
which is the starter files which you're going to

00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.460
need for each lesson in this course.

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:36.905
For example, when you go into the first section,

00:00:36.905 --> 00:00:38.600
and then we'll find a list of all of

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.150
the lessons inside of this section.

00:00:41.150 --> 00:00:42.950
Each one of these folders contains

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:44.360
the very bare minimum which

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:47.540
you'll need to start with each one of these lessons.

00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:49.310
The purpose of these folders

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:50.850
is to give us a starting point,

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:52.535
so we can just jump straight

00:00:52.535 --> 00:00:54.710
into learning about JavaScript without,

00:00:54.710 --> 00:00:56.180
for example, needing to write all of

00:00:56.180 --> 00:00:58.720
the required HTML code.

00:00:58.720 --> 00:01:01.925
Another benefit of all of these files is it also gives us

00:01:01.925 --> 00:01:03.680
a reference for all of

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.810
the lessons which we've done in the past.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:07.910
As we tick off each one of these lessons,

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:10.040
we have a reference which you can

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:12.815
look back to you if you ever get stuck in the future.

00:01:12.815 --> 00:01:14.520
This is all we need to do. Just go

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:16.335
ahead and download the folder.

00:01:16.335 --> 00:01:20.310
You can do this on the main folder entry points.

00:01:20.310 --> 00:01:22.400
Click on the "Code" button just here and you

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:24.350
can download the full ZIP file,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:25.520
which we're going to open up

00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:28.420
inside our Visual Studio Code.

00:01:28.420 --> 00:01:30.440
Once this has been downloaded,

00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:32.705
you should have a ZIP file which you can extract,

00:01:32.705 --> 00:01:35.195
usually by double-clicking the folder

00:01:35.195 --> 00:01:37.890
and then drag this over into your text editor.

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:40.100
I'm using Visual Studio Code and you should see

00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:43.165
all of the available sections over on the left.

00:01:43.165 --> 00:01:46.305
This is it, this is our starter files all complete.

00:01:46.305 --> 00:01:50.400
We can now jump into learning all about JavaScript.
