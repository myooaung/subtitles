00:00:01.850 --> 00:00:04.650
Along with all of the modifications we've been

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:06.630
making to existing elements,

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:08.865
we can also create our own too.

00:00:08.865 --> 00:00:11.430
In fact, we can even create sections or

00:00:11.430 --> 00:00:16.034
a full web page with HTML content inside of JavaScript.

00:00:16.034 --> 00:00:18.705
As you can imagine, this opens up many doors.

00:00:18.705 --> 00:00:21.390
A means of a content could be more dynamic and

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:24.780
also change even after the page has finished loading.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:27.360
This opens up so many possibilities

00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:28.560
and some examples could

00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:29.910
be to only show

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.625
the content to the user if they are logged in.

00:00:32.625 --> 00:00:35.280
We could get all of the users previous orders and

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:38.625
create a HTML list based of this information.

00:00:38.625 --> 00:00:40.440
The user could also add

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:43.280
a new to-do item and the list is endless.

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.945
It's only limited to our imagination or our use.

00:00:46.945 --> 00:00:49.745
Back over to the editor and head over

00:00:49.745 --> 00:00:52.310
into the creating new elements file.

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:54.680
Down at the bottom, we have some comments inside of

00:00:54.680 --> 00:00:57.355
the script to guide us through this video.

00:00:57.355 --> 00:00:59.360
Open this up in the browser and

00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.490
before we go ahead and create a new element,

00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:04.595
I want to show you something called document write.

00:01:04.595 --> 00:01:07.910
As it sounds, this writes directly to the document

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:11.690
which is our web page in the script,

00:01:11.690 --> 00:01:16.385
access the document and a method called write.

00:01:16.385 --> 00:01:18.170
Since this is a method,

00:01:18.170 --> 00:01:20.165
we open up the brackets like this,

00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:22.250
and then we can pass in a string which

00:01:22.250 --> 00:01:25.015
you want to display inside the document.

00:01:25.015 --> 00:01:28.785
I'll give this a save and reload the browser.

00:01:28.785 --> 00:01:30.740
Down at the very bottom we can see

00:01:30.740 --> 00:01:33.410
this text has been placed at the bottom,

00:01:33.410 --> 00:01:36.755
as well as inserting a plain string of texts like this.

00:01:36.755 --> 00:01:39.370
We can also inject some HTML.

00:01:39.370 --> 00:01:42.860
We can surround this inside of some element tags,

00:01:42.860 --> 00:01:46.620
such as H1, save,

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:47.930
and over to the browser and

00:01:47.930 --> 00:01:51.605
the larger level one heading has now taken effect.

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:53.660
This method is more useful,

00:01:53.660 --> 00:01:55.490
things like testing rather than

00:01:55.490 --> 00:01:58.600
actually adding any content or page.

00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:00.680
One of the reasons for this is because

00:02:00.680 --> 00:02:02.570
if the page has finished loading,

00:02:02.570 --> 00:02:06.275
it will override all of the existing content.

00:02:06.275 --> 00:02:08.660
We can see this better if we delay

00:02:08.660 --> 00:02:10.520
the document write to wait on

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.100
the page to first finish loading.

00:02:13.100 --> 00:02:16.775
To do this, we have a method available called setTimeout.

00:02:16.775 --> 00:02:18.730
Don't worry if you've not seen this before,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:23.135
it's a way to run a function after a certain time delay.

00:02:23.135 --> 00:02:26.630
We'll discuss this further into the Course 2.

00:02:26.630 --> 00:02:28.820
What we're going to do is

00:02:28.820 --> 00:02:30.950
comment-out the document write,

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:34.280
and then create a setTimeout function,

00:02:34.280 --> 00:02:37.210
which inside is going to take a function.

00:02:37.210 --> 00:02:39.620
We can write the function inside which is going

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.185
to run in any style which we want to.

00:02:42.185 --> 00:02:45.470
We can use the traditional function syntax

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:48.155
or we can pass in a arrow function.

00:02:48.155 --> 00:02:51.160
This was the brackets just like this.

00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.800
Great arrow, and since we're just using a single line,

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.720
we don't need to add the curly braces

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.670
or a return statement.

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:00.980
Instead, we can place inside

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.230
a document write just like above.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.750
Then inside of here, we can pass in

00:03:06.750 --> 00:03:09.900
a string or some HTML content.

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:13.965
Where did my content go?

00:03:13.965 --> 00:03:17.910
Then just after the document write, then comma,

00:03:17.910 --> 00:03:20.150
and then this is the second argument

00:03:20.150 --> 00:03:22.240
for our setTimeout function.

00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.070
The first one is actual function which

00:03:25.070 --> 00:03:27.550
we want to run and then separate it by this comma,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:30.290
where we'll have the time delay in milliseconds.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.125
If we place this in as 3,000,

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:36.700
this function will run after three seconds.

00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:40.970
Let's try this out if we now save and refresh.

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.895
We don't currently see any document right at the bottom,

00:03:43.895 --> 00:03:45.785
but after three seconds,

00:03:45.785 --> 00:03:47.420
our function will run and

00:03:47.420 --> 00:03:50.305
replace all of the existing content.

00:03:50.305 --> 00:03:53.165
The fact that this can happen means it's not

00:03:53.165 --> 00:03:56.450
often a good way of adding content to our web page.

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:59.510
For this, we'll have some more dedicated methods.

00:03:59.510 --> 00:04:01.520
Often when we create elements,

00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:03.560
this happens in multiple parts.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:05.540
If we were to create a text element,

00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:08.615
for example, we need to do this in multiple parts.

00:04:08.615 --> 00:04:10.310
First, we will create

00:04:10.310 --> 00:04:12.680
a P element and store this in a variable,

00:04:12.680 --> 00:04:15.320
and then create the text content node.

00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:17.795
Then we need to merge these two together.

00:04:17.795 --> 00:04:19.580
In this HTML start up file,

00:04:19.580 --> 00:04:22.915
we'll have a new HTML section just above.

00:04:22.915 --> 00:04:24.845
We have the section wrapper.

00:04:24.845 --> 00:04:26.980
Inside, we have a level three heading.

00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:29.690
We have this div with the class of contents,

00:04:29.690 --> 00:04:33.595
and then nested inside we have two more nested divs.

00:04:33.595 --> 00:04:35.570
The first one contains an image,

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.195
and the second one contains a P element,

00:04:38.195 --> 00:04:40.310
and also a buy button.

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:43.175
To get lots of practice creating our elements,

00:04:43.175 --> 00:04:45.965
we're going to recreate this full section,

00:04:45.965 --> 00:04:48.505
but this time using JavaScript.

00:04:48.505 --> 00:04:49.970
As a guide, we'll use

00:04:49.970 --> 00:04:51.890
the comments down at the bottom and we

00:04:51.890 --> 00:04:55.475
can remove these previous document write examples.

00:04:55.475 --> 00:04:57.500
Following these comments, we're going to begin

00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.345
by creating the section heading,

00:04:59.345 --> 00:05:01.520
which is this H3 about the top.

00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:02.810
Now, we'll keep going

00:05:02.810 --> 00:05:04.855
throughout the rest of the content.

00:05:04.855 --> 00:05:07.115
The way we can create a new element

00:05:07.115 --> 00:05:08.960
is by accessing the documents.

00:05:08.960 --> 00:05:12.310
Then using a method called create elements.

00:05:12.310 --> 00:05:14.370
For its elements is pretty simple,

00:05:14.370 --> 00:05:16.220
all we need to do is to pass in

00:05:16.220 --> 00:05:18.980
a string with the elements tag name.

00:05:18.980 --> 00:05:21.635
For example, we need to create a level 3 heading,

00:05:21.635 --> 00:05:23.630
so we do this and then

00:05:23.630 --> 00:05:26.590
we can store this inside of a variable.

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.570
Mine is going to be called the section heading

00:05:29.570 --> 00:05:32.375
and set this equal to our new element.

00:05:32.375 --> 00:05:34.400
Since we now have a variable reference,

00:05:34.400 --> 00:05:37.440
we can see this if we go over to the console.

00:05:39.110 --> 00:05:42.680
Then access this by the variable name.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:44.765
Passing this section heading,

00:05:44.765 --> 00:05:48.205
which returns back a empty level 3 heading.

00:05:48.205 --> 00:05:51.275
As mentioned before, when we create new elements,

00:05:51.275 --> 00:05:53.360
this is often in two parts.

00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:55.790
We'll have this element which is empty,

00:05:55.790 --> 00:05:58.960
and then we also need to create the text content inside.

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:01.640
Remember, earlier when we looked at the DOM,

00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:05.810
said that all objects inside of this tree, act as nodes.

00:06:05.810 --> 00:06:09.755
This example shows an element node in the form of our H1,

00:06:09.755 --> 00:06:12.665
then a text node with the text of hey,

00:06:12.665 --> 00:06:15.425
we have the first part which is the element node,

00:06:15.425 --> 00:06:16.805
which is our H3.

00:06:16.805 --> 00:06:20.100
Now we need to insert some text content.

00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.790
To do this, we have a method available

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:25.160
called createTextNode.

00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:28.580
This method is also available on the document object.

00:06:28.580 --> 00:06:32.695
We access document dot createTextNode.

00:06:32.695 --> 00:06:34.550
Inside we pass in a string

00:06:34.550 --> 00:06:35.960
of text which you want to insert.

00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:38.810
Since we are replicating this section,

00:06:38.810 --> 00:06:42.175
we can copy the content from inside.

00:06:42.175 --> 00:06:46.740
Place this in. Store this inside of a variable,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.570
let's say the heading text.

00:06:49.850 --> 00:06:52.770
Refresh the console and we should also see

00:06:52.770 --> 00:06:55.170
this if we type in the heading text.

00:06:55.170 --> 00:06:57.960
We have our text string just here.

00:06:57.960 --> 00:07:00.470
This now means we have two separate nodes.

00:07:00.470 --> 00:07:03.730
We have our element node and also our text node.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:06.940
But we need a way of merging these together.

00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:10.600
The way to do this is first access the parent node,

00:07:10.600 --> 00:07:12.740
which is the section heading,

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.870
grab this variable, and then since this is an element,

00:07:16.870 --> 00:07:20.200
we can access a method called appendChild.

00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:22.120
AppendChild will then take

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.695
in the child which want to merge in,

00:07:23.695 --> 00:07:25.640
which is our heading text.

00:07:25.640 --> 00:07:28.130
Place this in, save,

00:07:28.130 --> 00:07:30.655
and now back over to the console, refresh.

00:07:30.655 --> 00:07:32.815
Let's test out the section heading.

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:34.720
Now, rather than just returning

00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:36.805
a empty level 3 heading,

00:07:36.805 --> 00:07:40.180
this now also contains our string nested inside.

00:07:40.180 --> 00:07:42.130
This now completes our heading and

00:07:42.130 --> 00:07:44.740
the rest is going to be very similar.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.435
We'll go down to the image and just like before,

00:07:47.435 --> 00:07:51.240
we use document dot createElements.

00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:55.445
This time the type name is IMG.

00:07:55.445 --> 00:07:59.460
Store this inside of a constant called imageElement.

00:07:59.960 --> 00:08:02.210
As you would expect, an image is

00:08:02.210 --> 00:08:03.560
slightly different because we don't

00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:06.380
need to insert any of the text nodes inside.

00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:09.634
Instead, what we need to do is to set the attributes.

00:08:09.634 --> 00:08:14.395
We need to set both the source and also the alt text too.

00:08:14.395 --> 00:08:18.215
Just below this, access our image elements.

00:08:18.215 --> 00:08:21.070
We can call a method called setAttributes,

00:08:21.070 --> 00:08:22.500
which takes in two things.

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.320
The first one is a string of

00:08:24.320 --> 00:08:26.510
the attribute name, which is source,

00:08:26.510 --> 00:08:28.880
and then the content which they will

00:08:28.880 --> 00:08:32.270
file path of burger.jpg.

00:08:32.270 --> 00:08:34.820
Duplicate this and the second one is

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:37.010
the old text with the string,

00:08:37.010 --> 00:08:39.140
let's say burger image.

00:08:39.140 --> 00:08:41.210
We can also test this out in the browser

00:08:41.210 --> 00:08:43.400
by accessing our image elements.

00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.325
Refresh, access the image elements,

00:08:47.325 --> 00:08:49.130
and this looks exactly what we need for

00:08:49.130 --> 00:08:51.930
our image elements. Let's keep going.

00:08:51.930 --> 00:08:55.335
The info text, this is a P element.

00:08:55.335 --> 00:08:58.145
This section just here and while we're up here,

00:08:58.145 --> 00:09:00.170
let's copy the Lorem ipsum text.

00:09:00.170 --> 00:09:02.120
Then afterwards we'll create the button and then

00:09:02.120 --> 00:09:04.825
work outside onto our containers.

00:09:04.825 --> 00:09:06.510
We should know what to do here.

00:09:06.510 --> 00:09:10.130
We access the documents, create element.

00:09:10.130 --> 00:09:12.275
The element is the P element,

00:09:12.275 --> 00:09:13.670
and then we can store this inside of

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:17.610
a constant called infoSectionElement.

00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.655
The info section element is also going to take

00:09:24.655 --> 00:09:27.760
in a text node just like the heading above.

00:09:27.760 --> 00:09:31.210
Start this inside of a constant and keep this consistent.

00:09:31.210 --> 00:09:34.460
We'll say infoSectionText

00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:41.500
equals documents.createTextNode.

00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:44.410
I see now a string which we just copied from before,

00:09:44.410 --> 00:09:46.765
which is the Lorem ipsum text.

00:09:46.765 --> 00:09:48.640
We can see straight away that we have

00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:50.530
an error just like this because we

00:09:50.530 --> 00:09:54.490
need to make sure that all of this is on the same line.

00:09:54.490 --> 00:09:57.850
We can only insert multi-line text if it were to

00:09:57.850 --> 00:10:02.150
replace these single quotations with the backticks.

00:10:02.550 --> 00:10:05.680
As before, we have our two independent elements,

00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:07.750
and then we need to call appendChild on

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:10.465
the parent to merge these both together.

00:10:10.465 --> 00:10:13.790
The infoSectionElements.appendChild.

00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:18.175
I said I will text, which is

00:10:18.175 --> 00:10:22.180
infoSectionText. Let's try this out.

00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.715
We'll copy our parent container,

00:10:24.715 --> 00:10:27.070
paste this in and refresh on

00:10:27.070 --> 00:10:30.205
the textContent is now nested inside.

00:10:30.205 --> 00:10:32.335
Next, we have this button.

00:10:32.335 --> 00:10:33.880
The button will follow a very

00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:35.590
similar pattern to this info,

00:10:35.590 --> 00:10:38.500
so we'll copy all this section,

00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:40.810
paste this in, but of course,

00:10:40.810 --> 00:10:44.095
we need to change the p element to be a button.

00:10:44.095 --> 00:10:47.600
The text is going to be, buy online.

00:10:49.920 --> 00:10:51.955
We still need to append

00:10:51.955 --> 00:10:53.650
the child element into the button,

00:10:53.650 --> 00:10:56.515
but we do need to change these variable names.

00:10:56.515 --> 00:11:03.020
We'll say the buttonElement, then the buttonText.

00:11:04.740 --> 00:11:07.900
Down at the bottom, we'll select our button elements,

00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:09.250
which is the parents,

00:11:09.250 --> 00:11:15.355
then append the buttonText. Let's try this out.

00:11:15.355 --> 00:11:19.030
Refresh, refresh this

00:11:19.030 --> 00:11:21.805
and paste this in, and there's a button.

00:11:21.805 --> 00:11:24.010
This is fine, and if we go back,

00:11:24.010 --> 00:11:25.840
now up to our HTML section,

00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:28.090
we've created all of the text elements.

00:11:28.090 --> 00:11:29.335
We've got the H3,

00:11:29.335 --> 00:11:30.700
we've got our image elements,

00:11:30.700 --> 00:11:33.175
we've got our P, and also the button.

00:11:33.175 --> 00:11:36.655
The final thing we need to do is to create our wrappers.

00:11:36.655 --> 00:11:38.905
We've got a div here, we've got one here,

00:11:38.905 --> 00:11:41.245
a wrapper for both of these sections,

00:11:41.245 --> 00:11:44.305
and then finally the outer section wrapper.

00:11:44.305 --> 00:11:46.180
Like with all other elements,

00:11:46.180 --> 00:11:48.295
we're going to use createElements.

00:11:48.295 --> 00:11:50.530
I'm going to copy this line one,

00:11:50.530 --> 00:11:53.075
place this underneath the wrappers.

00:11:53.075 --> 00:11:54.900
This one is the section wrapper,

00:11:54.900 --> 00:11:56.310
which is the main element

00:11:56.310 --> 00:11:58.290
surrounding all of this content.

00:11:58.290 --> 00:12:00.710
This was a section element.

00:12:00.710 --> 00:12:04.495
Then I'm going to duplicate this three more times.

00:12:04.495 --> 00:12:07.520
The rest of these elements will all div.

00:12:07.770 --> 00:12:10.765
But they do need have some unique names,

00:12:10.765 --> 00:12:15.410
so the section one is going to be the contentWrapper.

00:12:15.750 --> 00:12:19.255
This is the content just here.

00:12:19.255 --> 00:12:22.120
Our last two is the one surrounding

00:12:22.120 --> 00:12:23.560
the image and then the one

00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:25.615
surrounding text and the button.

00:12:25.615 --> 00:12:30.830
So we'll call number 3, the imageDivWrapper.

00:12:31.170 --> 00:12:33.280
Then the last one was surrounding

00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:34.300
the text and the button,

00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:37.390
so we'll call this the textDivWrapper,

00:12:37.390 --> 00:12:39.460
which then brings us down to

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:42.190
this section which is putting it all together.

00:12:42.190 --> 00:12:45.160
What we need to do now is to basically merge all of

00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:46.810
the elements which you created up

00:12:46.810 --> 00:12:49.360
above inside of all wrappers.

00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:51.550
The way to do this is also to make

00:12:51.550 --> 00:12:54.010
use of the appendChild method.

00:12:54.010 --> 00:12:56.935
We'll start from the inside and work our way out.

00:12:56.935 --> 00:12:59.935
First of all, we'll work with the info section

00:12:59.935 --> 00:13:03.760
and we'll insert the p elements and also the button.

00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.480
Down to the bottom, what we're going to do is to select

00:13:07.480 --> 00:13:12.070
our textDivWrapper all appendChild.

00:13:12.070 --> 00:13:13.690
Then we need to do this two times.

00:13:13.690 --> 00:13:15.340
The first one we need to pass

00:13:15.340 --> 00:13:18.110
in the info section elements.

00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:22.885
Info section element is the text,

00:13:22.885 --> 00:13:24.595
which we created just here.

00:13:24.595 --> 00:13:26.980
Then we also need to do this a second time,

00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:29.560
but this one is going to be for our button.

00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:32.770
The button is a variable name of buttonElement.

00:13:32.770 --> 00:13:35.320
We can duplicate this,

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:38.420
insert our button elements.

00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.710
Before we go any further, we can see

00:13:40.710 --> 00:13:42.450
this inside the console if we grow up

00:13:42.450 --> 00:13:46.455
our textDivWrapper. Paste this in.

00:13:46.455 --> 00:13:49.480
As expected, this contains a div element,

00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:50.800
and then open this up, we have

00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:53.965
our p element and also the button.

00:13:53.965 --> 00:13:56.935
Next onto the imageDivWrapper.

00:13:56.935 --> 00:13:59.965
This one is just come to be one element nested inside.

00:13:59.965 --> 00:14:02.480
This is our image element.

00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:07.240
Pretty simple. Make some space.

00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:09.760
Call the appendChild method and then we can

00:14:09.760 --> 00:14:12.625
insert our image elements.

00:14:12.625 --> 00:14:15.385
Now back up to our HTML.

00:14:15.385 --> 00:14:16.930
We've got this section created

00:14:16.930 --> 00:14:19.345
here and also this one here.

00:14:19.345 --> 00:14:21.250
We need to go one more level up

00:14:21.250 --> 00:14:22.930
and access our content wrapper,

00:14:22.930 --> 00:14:26.690
and then insert both of these divWrappers.

00:14:27.270 --> 00:14:30.325
Select our content wrapper,

00:14:30.325 --> 00:14:33.970
go to appendChild, and then we need to

00:14:33.970 --> 00:14:38.245
insert both our textDivWrapper and also the image onto.

00:14:38.245 --> 00:14:40.510
Let's start with the text,

00:14:40.510 --> 00:14:42.385
and then let's duplicate this.

00:14:42.385 --> 00:14:44.200
Again, inside the content wrapper,

00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:47.630
we're going to place in our imageDivWrapper.

00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:50.140
Again, before we go any further,

00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:52.600
we'll grab our contentWrapper and make sure

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:55.975
both of these divs are nested inside.

00:14:55.975 --> 00:14:59.230
Paste. Open this up.

00:14:59.230 --> 00:15:00.610
There's our two divs inside.

00:15:00.610 --> 00:15:02.740
The first one is the text,

00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:05.515
and the second one is the image element.

00:15:05.515 --> 00:15:07.210
Good. We're almost there,

00:15:07.210 --> 00:15:08.605
now if we go back up,

00:15:08.605 --> 00:15:10.210
let's see what we need to do next.

00:15:10.210 --> 00:15:13.360
We have the level 1 heading and also this

00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.425
full content div nested inside of our section.

00:15:17.425 --> 00:15:19.810
We need to grab a section and do

00:15:19.810 --> 00:15:22.730
two more appendChild methods.

00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:30.175
This section was the section wrapper called appendChild,

00:15:30.175 --> 00:15:32.080
and the first child which we need to

00:15:32.080 --> 00:15:35.060
insert is the section heading.

00:15:35.310 --> 00:15:38.830
The section heading remember was our level 3 heading,

00:15:38.830 --> 00:15:40.465
and then we need to duplicate this,

00:15:40.465 --> 00:15:44.210
and the second element is our content wrapper.

00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.210
This should not be all of our content now in place,

00:15:49.210 --> 00:15:50.590
and the final thing to do to finish

00:15:50.590 --> 00:15:53.740
this section off is to add our three classes.

00:15:53.740 --> 00:15:55.270
We have the content class,

00:15:55.270 --> 00:15:56.905
we have the image section,

00:15:56.905 --> 00:15:59.260
and also the info section too.

00:15:59.260 --> 00:16:01.345
These are all added to our divs.

00:16:01.345 --> 00:16:03.175
So let's go down to the bottom,

00:16:03.175 --> 00:16:05.530
and just below adding classes,

00:16:05.530 --> 00:16:08.275
the first one is the content wrapper.

00:16:08.275 --> 00:16:11.320
We can add the class with set attributes.

00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:13.780
Set attribute takes in it two things.

00:16:13.780 --> 00:16:16.150
The first one is the name of the attribute,

00:16:16.150 --> 00:16:20.905
which is class, and then the class name of content.

00:16:20.905 --> 00:16:23.350
Duplicate this two more times,

00:16:23.350 --> 00:16:24.430
and the second one was for

00:16:24.430 --> 00:16:27.865
our imageDivWrapper, this image.

00:16:27.865 --> 00:16:30.040
Let's take a look. The class name for

00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.870
our image was this one just here.

00:16:31.870 --> 00:16:35.090
Go back down.

00:16:36.210 --> 00:16:40.960
Image_section. The third and final one

00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:43.550
is for our text div wrapper.

00:16:44.010 --> 00:16:48.190
This textDivWrapper is the info section.

00:16:48.190 --> 00:16:52.165
Let's grab this and paste this in as our string.

00:16:52.165 --> 00:16:55.060
Good. Let's give this one final test inside

00:16:55.060 --> 00:16:57.970
the browser and we need to test out the section wrapper,

00:16:57.970 --> 00:17:01.180
which is the main wrapper surrounding all of the content.

00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:03.940
We load, add this in.

00:17:03.940 --> 00:17:07.300
Open this up and what I'm going to do is to scroll up to

00:17:07.300 --> 00:17:10.855
our HTML and make sure this is exactly the same.

00:17:10.855 --> 00:17:13.510
To begin, we have the section wrapper,

00:17:13.510 --> 00:17:15.175
which contains two elements,

00:17:15.175 --> 00:17:16.495
the level 3 heading,

00:17:16.495 --> 00:17:18.475
which is there, the div,

00:17:18.475 --> 00:17:19.975
the class of content,

00:17:19.975 --> 00:17:24.040
and then all of the additional content is nested inside.

00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:27.040
Open this up. This contains two divs.

00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:29.785
The first one has the class of info section,

00:17:29.785 --> 00:17:32.365
and the second one is the image section.

00:17:32.365 --> 00:17:34.915
We've got the info section and then the image.

00:17:34.915 --> 00:17:35.965
So we just need to make sure

00:17:35.965 --> 00:17:37.780
ours are the other way around.

00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:41.035
Al we need to do is to swap the position of

00:17:41.035 --> 00:17:42.520
these two elements to make sure that

00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:45.805
our image is just above our text.

00:17:45.805 --> 00:17:48.760
Save, and we'll try this one more time.

00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:54.350
Open up the section wrapper into the contentdiv.

00:17:55.860 --> 00:17:57.970
Good. We're now back on track.

00:17:57.970 --> 00:17:59.890
We have the image section at the top.

00:17:59.890 --> 00:18:02.290
Inside this contains the image elements.

00:18:02.290 --> 00:18:04.660
The info section down at the bottom,

00:18:04.660 --> 00:18:07.930
this contains our p elements and also our button.

00:18:07.930 --> 00:18:09.625
Good. This is all now in place,

00:18:09.625 --> 00:18:11.830
and the last thing to do in the next video,

00:18:11.830 --> 00:18:13.705
is to look at some ways we can use to

00:18:13.705 --> 00:18:16.610
add this to our main page.
