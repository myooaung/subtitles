00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:06.440
I've had quite a practice so far of creating events,

00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:07.890
and we've also taken a look at how

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:09.390
we can add the one's option

00:00:09.390 --> 00:00:12.840
if you are a listener to only run a single event once.

00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:14.100
As soon as that happens,

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:16.740
the event listener is then removed from the elements.

00:00:16.740 --> 00:00:19.610
But we can also remove event listeners manually

00:00:19.610 --> 00:00:23.880
too we can remove them if they no longer needed or used,

00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:27.330
and this removal is not essential in smaller projects,

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.940
but once we get to a larger scale project,

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:32.895
cleaning up any old unused event listeners

00:00:32.895 --> 00:00:35.190
can really improve efficiency.

00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:37.860
It also means we can use the same element to do

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:39.495
different things all by

00:00:39.495 --> 00:00:42.195
adding and removing these event listeners.

00:00:42.195 --> 00:00:44.010
Jump into the Chrome file,

00:00:44.010 --> 00:00:45.915
which is removing event listeners,

00:00:45.915 --> 00:00:48.250
and if you open this up inside the browser,

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:49.810
you'll notice we moved away from

00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:52.030
the burger project setup.

00:00:52.030 --> 00:00:54.120
We have a simple example,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.955
so have a span element,

00:00:55.955 --> 00:00:57.820
and then inside the P elements will

00:00:57.820 --> 00:01:00.055
have a startup score of zero.

00:01:00.055 --> 00:01:01.930
The aim here is to click on

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:04.090
this add button to increase the score,

00:01:04.090 --> 00:01:05.680
and then we'll use the cancel button

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:07.760
to remove the event listener.

00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:12.780
This also links to our events.js inside the same folder,

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.380
and if we jump into this, we've got

00:01:14.380 --> 00:01:16.900
a reference to all three of our elements.

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.690
We have the add button, we have the cancel button,

00:01:19.690 --> 00:01:22.460
and then the output, which is our number.

00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:24.595
What we'll start to do inside here

00:01:24.595 --> 00:01:26.450
is to create an event listener,

00:01:26.450 --> 00:01:28.595
which we're going to remove in the future.

00:01:28.595 --> 00:01:32.225
This event listener will be attached to our add button,

00:01:32.225 --> 00:01:35.425
so let's add this as we normally do.

00:01:35.425 --> 00:01:38.000
This now for a click and then will

00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:41.030
trigger a function called increase.

00:01:41.030 --> 00:01:43.445
This should all be familiar. We'll now create

00:01:43.445 --> 00:01:46.680
our increased function just above.

00:01:46.700 --> 00:01:49.385
What do we want this function to do?

00:01:49.385 --> 00:01:50.840
Well, we need to select

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.780
this output which is the current value of zero.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:55.220
This is a p element.

00:01:55.220 --> 00:01:56.510
We want to select

00:01:56.510 --> 00:01:59.620
the current value and then increase it by one.

00:01:59.620 --> 00:02:03.755
First of all, the way to do this is to select our output.

00:02:03.755 --> 00:02:06.350
We can change the inner text content

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.220
and reset this to be a new value.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:11.735
Currently, we want to add

00:02:11.735 --> 00:02:14.660
the value of one each time we click on this button,

00:02:14.660 --> 00:02:16.235
but one thing we need to remember

00:02:16.235 --> 00:02:18.155
is here we have the inner text.

00:02:18.155 --> 00:02:20.500
Well, here we add in a number,

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.760
so what we first need to do is to convert

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:25.295
our inner text to be a number.

00:02:25.295 --> 00:02:28.970
Where you can do this is to access the number function,

00:02:28.970 --> 00:02:30.410
and then what we'll do is to

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:34.315
grab the current output.innerText.

00:02:34.315 --> 00:02:36.740
This will then transform this into a number,

00:02:36.740 --> 00:02:39.230
and then we'll add one onto this.

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:42.500
Let's give this a try and save the file, and refresh.

00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:44.645
Click on add, and each time I click on this,

00:02:44.645 --> 00:02:47.285
this is increased by the value of one.

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:49.370
Next, we also need to listen out for

00:02:49.370 --> 00:02:51.365
a click on this cancel button.

00:02:51.365 --> 00:02:54.020
This is pretty much a repeat of the above process.

00:02:54.020 --> 00:02:56.330
We'll grab a reference to our cancel button.

00:02:56.330 --> 00:02:58.525
We'll add the event listener.

00:02:58.525 --> 00:03:01.100
Let's now for the click event,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.740
then call a function called stopListener.

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.610
This load will create this function.

00:03:11.270 --> 00:03:13.950
For now, just place in a cancel log

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:16.270
so know this one is running.

00:03:16.270 --> 00:03:18.680
Let's try this out, refresh

00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:21.725
the browser and into the developer tools,

00:03:21.725 --> 00:03:24.430
jump into the cancel.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.840
Cancel button will now take our logs.

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:30.260
To get this cancel button to actually

00:03:30.260 --> 00:03:32.825
remove the event listener from our add button.

00:03:32.825 --> 00:03:34.220
What we need to do is to access

00:03:34.220 --> 00:03:36.970
a method called remove event listener.

00:03:36.970 --> 00:03:38.670
This is pretty straightforward to

00:03:38.670 --> 00:03:41.160
do rather than our cancel log;

00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:42.705
we can remove this.

00:03:42.705 --> 00:03:45.220
We can access the add button,

00:03:45.220 --> 00:03:48.090
and call remove event listener.

00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:51.030
Say this, and we'll try this out,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:54.270
refresh the browser, will click on the add button,

00:03:54.270 --> 00:03:55.875
and this increases the value.

00:03:55.875 --> 00:03:57.710
Click the Cancel button,

00:03:57.710 --> 00:03:59.580
see an error inside the cancel,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:02.100
say in two arguments are required, and still,

00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:03.740
if we tried to click on the add button,

00:04:03.740 --> 00:04:06.205
the event listener is not yet canceled.

00:04:06.205 --> 00:04:08.465
This is because we also need to pass in

00:04:08.465 --> 00:04:10.130
the same parameters that

00:04:10.130 --> 00:04:12.215
we used when we added the event listener,

00:04:12.215 --> 00:04:14.360
so we need to remove the click and also the

00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.500
function call refresh,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.575
and we'll try to add, which is fine.

00:04:18.575 --> 00:04:20.720
We'll remove the event listener would cancel.

00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:22.310
Now we don't see any errors,

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:24.095
and if we tried to click on the add button,

00:04:24.095 --> 00:04:26.905
no further updates will take place.

00:04:26.905 --> 00:04:29.000
As we've just seen, we need to make sure that

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.805
the parameters are exactly the same too.

00:04:31.805 --> 00:04:33.110
Currently, we have the click event,

00:04:33.110 --> 00:04:34.460
which will is now four, and

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.005
this is called in the same function.

00:04:36.005 --> 00:04:38.480
But if we tried to remove a different event listener,

00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:41.840
such as changing this to you on mouseover,

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:45.020
we could say this and try this out once more time.

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:46.970
The add button works. But if

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.650
we cancel the event listener,

00:04:48.650 --> 00:04:50.450
the add button will still work since we

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:53.275
have a different event type.

00:04:53.275 --> 00:04:55.200
Let's change it back to click.

00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.665
Also, if we had the options object,

00:04:57.665 --> 00:04:59.780
like we looked up previously, for example,

00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:02.690
we could set the capture phase to be true.

00:05:02.690 --> 00:05:04.640
Now, if we reload try,

00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:08.225
we'll try this out once more, we'll try to cancel.

00:05:08.225 --> 00:05:10.250
The add button still works.

00:05:10.250 --> 00:05:11.870
This is because we don't have

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:13.505
exactly the same parameters

00:05:13.505 --> 00:05:15.570
inside of our remove event listener,

00:05:15.570 --> 00:05:17.810
so it's considered a different event.

00:05:17.810 --> 00:05:19.235
If we wanted this to work,

00:05:19.235 --> 00:05:22.120
as you would expect, we also need to copy this over.

00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:25.470
add in the third parameter, test this out.

00:05:25.470 --> 00:05:27.500
We'll try to cancel, and now we can't

00:05:27.500 --> 00:05:29.855
add any more numbers onto this.

00:05:29.855 --> 00:05:31.835
This is what we need to do to remove

00:05:31.835 --> 00:05:34.625
an event listener at any stage of our program.

00:05:34.625 --> 00:05:36.875
As we've seen, we also need to make sure that

00:05:36.875 --> 00:05:39.260
all of the parameters are exactly the same.

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:43.050
Otherwise, this would be considered a different event.
