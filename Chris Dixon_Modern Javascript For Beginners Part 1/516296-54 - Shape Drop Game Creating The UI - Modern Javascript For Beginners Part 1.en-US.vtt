00:00:02.550 --> 00:00:05.410
Welcome back. We've got a fun little game

00:00:05.410 --> 00:00:07.180
to end off this section,

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.520
which is going to be a shape drop game.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:13.600
This is going to make use of the HTML drag-and-drop API,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:16.030
which means we can create all of these shapes.

00:00:16.030 --> 00:00:17.515
We've got a section at the top with

00:00:17.515 --> 00:00:20.755
empty outlines and then the shapes down at the bottom.

00:00:20.755 --> 00:00:23.200
The user can then drag onto these and drop them

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:25.765
in the correct matching location.

00:00:25.765 --> 00:00:27.670
Each one of these shapes on the bottom has

00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:29.770
a corresponding shape up on the top.

00:00:29.770 --> 00:00:32.185
If you've got these right, we increase the score.

00:00:32.185 --> 00:00:35.365
You get these wrong, this score is deducted by one.

00:00:35.365 --> 00:00:39.220
Going to begin in this video by creating all the HTML,

00:00:39.220 --> 00:00:41.350
so basically the user interface.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.180
Then in the upcoming videos,

00:00:43.180 --> 00:00:45.795
we'll make all this work using JavaScript.

00:00:45.795 --> 00:00:49.670
This project is going to make use of another Web API,

00:00:49.670 --> 00:00:52.280
which is the drag-and-drop API.

00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.980
The drag and drop API gives us access to

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:56.960
various drag events which

00:00:56.960 --> 00:00:58.894
we can use inside of JavaScript.

00:00:58.894 --> 00:01:02.210
We can listen out for when an element has began to drag.

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.490
We can listen out for when the drag ends.

00:01:04.490 --> 00:01:07.415
We can listen out when an item is being dragged over,

00:01:07.415 --> 00:01:09.920
when it's left a particular target and also,

00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.745
listen out for when this item has been dropped to.

00:01:12.745 --> 00:01:15.230
This is what we're going to use in the upcoming videos.

00:01:15.230 --> 00:01:17.120
But for now, let's head over to

00:01:17.120 --> 00:01:18.650
the project files and we'll

00:01:18.650 --> 00:01:21.175
start inside of the index page.

00:01:21.175 --> 00:01:23.060
Inside the shape drop game, this is

00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:24.860
a pretty simple index page.

00:01:24.860 --> 00:01:27.965
Other half is our very basic structure

00:01:27.965 --> 00:01:31.490
which links to an empty script.js.

00:01:31.490 --> 00:01:32.990
Let's start this project.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.820
I've already added some styles into this.

00:01:34.820 --> 00:01:36.650
All we've done here is add

00:01:36.650 --> 00:01:39.515
some classes which link to various shapes.

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:42.300
For example, we've got various rectangles,

00:01:42.300 --> 00:01:45.195
we've got pills, we've got, we've got squares.

00:01:45.195 --> 00:01:47.795
Each one of these is generally the width and the height.

00:01:47.795 --> 00:01:49.340
We've got a background color,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:52.615
and some of them also have a border-radius too.

00:01:52.615 --> 00:01:54.780
We'll jump into our HTML,

00:01:54.780 --> 00:01:56.540
we'll create all of these elements,

00:01:56.540 --> 00:01:58.580
and link these to the correct classes.

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:00.830
The script is empty for the future videos,

00:02:00.830 --> 00:02:03.970
and we're going to start in the index.html.

00:02:03.970 --> 00:02:07.130
Let's jump into here and into the body section.

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:08.690
The body section is going to be

00:02:08.690 --> 00:02:10.455
relatively straightforward.

00:02:10.455 --> 00:02:12.355
If we look at the final game,

00:02:12.355 --> 00:02:14.380
we have a header section with the score and

00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:18.205
some text and then we have two separate sections below.

00:02:18.205 --> 00:02:19.900
Each one of these sections is going to

00:02:19.900 --> 00:02:21.610
be a div big shape.

00:02:21.610 --> 00:02:23.530
Then we'll just link these to the class names to

00:02:23.530 --> 00:02:26.875
provide each one of these shapes and colors.

00:02:26.875 --> 00:02:30.695
In the body section, at the header,

00:02:30.695 --> 00:02:33.585
which will be for a very top section.

00:02:33.585 --> 00:02:36.815
As you can see, the first thing we need is a heading.

00:02:36.815 --> 00:02:39.650
It's h3. We'll say score,

00:02:39.650 --> 00:02:41.920
which will just be hard-coded text.

00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:45.235
But then just afterwards we need a dynamic value.

00:02:45.235 --> 00:02:48.500
We can surround this in a span,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:53.040
place in the ID of score and then

00:02:53.040 --> 00:02:54.330
we'll fill in the contents of

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:56.794
the span later on using JavaScript.

00:02:56.794 --> 00:02:59.000
One thing we can't see on this final version

00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.205
is a button called Play Again.

00:03:01.205 --> 00:03:03.080
This is because he's put some will only

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.225
appear at the very end of the game.

00:03:05.225 --> 00:03:07.820
But for now, we'll place this in and then we'll hide this

00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:11.430
later on to detect Play Again.

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:16.415
Then let's open up our version inside the browser.

00:03:16.415 --> 00:03:18.830
Copy the path to our index.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:20.540
You should see all of the

00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:22.850
predefined styles have now kicked in.

00:03:22.850 --> 00:03:26.440
The last thing we need inside this header is the text.

00:03:26.440 --> 00:03:29.550
Just underneath button add a p element.

00:03:29.550 --> 00:03:31.050
The text of drag,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:34.480
the colorful shapes into the matching holes.

00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.310
Good, after we've done this,

00:03:40.310 --> 00:03:42.545
we then move down to our two sections.

00:03:42.545 --> 00:03:44.300
The top section is going to be

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:45.800
the drop section because we

00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:47.525
dropped the shapes inside of here,

00:03:47.525 --> 00:03:50.410
and the bottom one is going to be the drag section.

00:03:50.410 --> 00:03:52.010
These are pretty much the same.

00:03:52.010 --> 00:03:53.330
They're going to have the same

00:03:53.330 --> 00:03:55.205
class names to create the shapes.

00:03:55.205 --> 00:03:58.160
We'll also add an additional class to the top section.

00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.720
They just have the outline

00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:02.330
rather than the solid background color.

00:04:02.330 --> 00:04:06.250
Let's check this out. Looking good.

00:04:06.250 --> 00:04:09.305
Now, just below the header, create our first,

00:04:09.305 --> 00:04:12.350
which is the top section inside of a div,

00:04:12.350 --> 00:04:16.080
and give us a class of the drop section.

00:04:16.550 --> 00:04:18.740
Duplicate this, and

00:04:18.740 --> 00:04:22.770
our second section is going to be for the drag section.

00:04:22.840 --> 00:04:25.160
We can use any elements which you

00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.825
want to for each one of these shapes,

00:04:26.825 --> 00:04:28.790
it's just going to be an empty element.

00:04:28.790 --> 00:04:30.710
I'm going to go for a div.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:32.450
We don't need any text or

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.670
any content inside the div because we use

00:04:34.670 --> 00:04:36.200
the CSS class to link

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:38.660
this and create the shape on the page.

00:04:38.660 --> 00:04:42.845
For example, about the class of square.

00:04:42.845 --> 00:04:47.180
Save this. Square now appears on the screen.

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:48.830
We see this because this class of

00:04:48.830 --> 00:04:52.325
square inside of our styles.css,

00:04:52.325 --> 00:04:54.770
just here as the background color

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.710
and also has a width and a height set.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:59.885
This will automatically place our shape on the screen.

00:04:59.885 --> 00:05:02.850
The same for all of the rest of the classes,

00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:05.785
duplicate this one and the second one.

00:05:05.785 --> 00:05:08.720
This one is for our rectangle,

00:05:09.630 --> 00:05:13.490
number 3 is for the circle,

00:05:14.460 --> 00:05:19.010
number 4, square number 2.

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:22.130
Even though we've got some of the same shapes

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.040
such as two different squares on here,

00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.250
you'll notice that they are

00:05:25.250 --> 00:05:26.510
different sizes to make the game

00:05:26.510 --> 00:05:28.190
a little bit more difficult.

00:05:28.190 --> 00:05:30.485
We've got the square number 2.

00:05:30.485 --> 00:05:32.540
The next one is for oval number

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:41.870
2 and rectangle 2, rectangle number 3.

00:05:41.870 --> 00:05:44.640
Next one is for pill,

00:05:46.660 --> 00:05:53.590
oval, then finally pill number 2.

00:05:53.990 --> 00:05:57.020
Let's save this and check out our project.

00:05:57.020 --> 00:06:00.680
Refresh. There's oval shapes now on the screen.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:02.810
The next thing to do is to basically

00:06:02.810 --> 00:06:04.310
copy all of these sections,

00:06:04.310 --> 00:06:05.990
all of the shapes, and paste

00:06:05.990 --> 00:06:08.790
them inside of our drag section.

00:06:09.010 --> 00:06:12.230
Even all of our shapes now in place.

00:06:12.230 --> 00:06:13.580
But we need to now mix up

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.020
the second section because if we

00:06:15.020 --> 00:06:18.080
didn't we had all of these in the same order as above,

00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.000
it will be really easy game.

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.650
Just mix up some of these.

00:06:21.650 --> 00:06:24.185
I'm going to make it the same as a final version.

00:06:24.185 --> 00:06:28.005
At the beginning we've got the rectangle, is at the top,

00:06:28.005 --> 00:06:34.815
the square, the third one is the pill, square 2.

00:06:34.815 --> 00:06:37.130
It doesn't matter if yours is different or the same.

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:40.090
You can make it exactly how you would like to.

00:06:40.090 --> 00:06:44.340
Oval 2, pill number 2 next,

00:06:44.340 --> 00:06:47.160
circle, rectangle, and then rectangle.

00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.920
That's completely fine, as long as

00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.505
it's in a different order to the ones above.

00:06:51.505 --> 00:06:55.140
To keep our shapes consistent in both of the sections,

00:06:55.140 --> 00:06:56.620
we've used this same class name

00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:58.660
on the top and the bottom sections.

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:01.300
But the problem we currently have in our version

00:07:01.300 --> 00:07:04.315
is the shapes on the top have this background color.

00:07:04.315 --> 00:07:06.010
What we want is just like

00:07:06.010 --> 00:07:08.560
the final version where we have an empty outline.

00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:10.195
We can drag these shapes in,

00:07:10.195 --> 00:07:12.250
which will then fill in the background color to give

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:15.395
the illusion that the shape is being dropped into a hole.

00:07:15.395 --> 00:07:18.300
We can do this by adding an additional class.

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:19.600
If we take a look inside of

00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:22.270
our style sheets and then go down to the bottom,

00:07:22.270 --> 00:07:24.145
we have this class of drop.

00:07:24.145 --> 00:07:26.455
This is certainly a purple border,

00:07:26.455 --> 00:07:27.865
which we see in the final version

00:07:27.865 --> 00:07:29.380
around each one of our shapes.

00:07:29.380 --> 00:07:31.930
We've also removed any background color.

00:07:31.930 --> 00:07:34.920
Now inside of our index page in the top section,

00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:36.110
we can add this class, I've

00:07:36.110 --> 00:07:38.940
dropped each one of our shapes.

00:07:39.550 --> 00:07:42.170
We can copy and paste this if you want to,

00:07:42.170 --> 00:07:44.220
or you can type this out.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:48.270
Places for each one of our shapes.

00:07:48.270 --> 00:07:55.155
We got to save,

00:07:55.155 --> 00:07:57.285
and let's check out our own version.

00:07:57.285 --> 00:07:59.810
Refresh. Now I've got an empty shape which we

00:07:59.810 --> 00:08:02.675
can now move any one of these elements inside.

00:08:02.675 --> 00:08:05.720
Of course, if we try to click and move any of these,

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.105
we don't see the drag events that just yet.

00:08:08.105 --> 00:08:10.040
But this is something which will enable in

00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.860
the upcoming videos when we make use of JavaScript.
