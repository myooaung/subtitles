00:00:00.986 --> 00:00:04.986
In this section we'll be discussing developing team estimates.

2
00:00:04.986 --> 00:00:08.186
In order to effectively develop a team estimate,

3
00:00:08.186 --> 00:00:13.653
your team must first understand and embrace everything we learned to this point.

4
00:00:13.653 --> 00:00:18.986
As a leader, you must also learn how to ask for estimates,

5
00:00:18.986 --> 00:00:23.986
probe deeper for more refinement, and begin building a WBS,

6
00:00:23.986 --> 00:00:25.986
Work Breakdown Structure-based estimate.

7
00:00:25.986 --> 00:00:29.986
Let's see how this is done.

8
00:00:29.986 --> 00:00:34.986
Now let's see how you can facilitate developing team estimates.

9
00:00:34.986 --> 00:00:41.986
The entire team understands the standard process for estimation.

10
00:00:41.986 --> 00:00:46.986
The team is fully trained, on board, and engaged.

11
00:00:46.986 --> 00:00:52.986
You always expect estimates in ideal time from team members.

12
00:00:52.986 --> 00:00:57.927
You itemize the tasks and discuss as a team to get a

13
00:00:57.927 --> 00:00:59.986
consensus of the ideal estimates.

14
00:00:59.986 --> 00:01:02.174
Begin your work breakdown structure,

15
00:01:02.174 --> 00:01:06.986
and we will see an example in the next few slides.

16
00:01:06.986 --> 00:01:10.542
You'll want to be able to add, modify,

17
00:01:10.542 --> 00:01:14.986
or remove tasks that are required to accomplish project goals.

18
00:01:14.986 --> 00:01:19.986
Then adjust those estimates through open and honest discussions.

19
00:01:19.986 --> 00:01:24.602
And always embrace and facilitate collaboration.

20
00:01:24.602 --> 00:01:29.986
You want to collaborate as a team.

21
00:01:29.986 --> 00:01:33.320
Now when should you iterate estimates?

22
00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.986
Here's a scenario.

23
00:01:34.986 --> 00:01:38.986
You ask a team member, how long will that task take?

24
00:01:38.986 --> 00:01:42.097
They think about it, 24 ideal hours.

25
00:01:42.097 --> 00:01:46.986
That's because they're well trained, they know to use ideal hours.

26
00:01:46.986 --> 00:01:52.986
Now based on what you need, the 24 hours may be a good answer and off you go.

27
00:01:52.986 --> 00:01:56.186
No more estimating needed, you have your answer.

28
00:01:56.186 --> 00:01:58.986
But how much accuracy might you need?

29
00:01:58.986 --> 00:02:02.986
Or might you be able to tolerate if it's larger?

30
00:02:02.986 --> 00:02:07.486
For example, what if the estimate was 500 hours?

31
00:02:07.486 --> 00:02:10.986
Now you may need to iterate again.

32
00:02:10.986 --> 00:02:13.168
In fact, you should iterate again.

33
00:02:13.168 --> 00:02:14.986
That's a pretty large number.

34
00:02:14.986 --> 00:02:19.221
And here's a really good rule of thumb.

35
00:02:19.221 --> 00:02:23.986
Keep iterating until the size of estimate is reasonable,

36
00:02:23.986 --> 00:02:25.574
understandable, and actionable.

37
00:02:25.574 --> 00:02:28.751
So, in the 500 hour example,

38
00:02:28.751 --> 00:02:34.869
do I really understand what would be done within that 500 hours?

39
00:02:34.869 --> 00:02:40.986
Could I actually delegate that task and someone could take action on it?

40
00:02:40.986 --> 00:02:44.486
Maybe, but I think in my experience likely not.

41
00:02:44.486 --> 00:02:51.986
So you iterate again and maybe the 500 hours breaks down to maybe

42
00:02:51.986 --> 00:02:57.000
eight or nine tasks with smaller number of hours. That's what I would recommend.
