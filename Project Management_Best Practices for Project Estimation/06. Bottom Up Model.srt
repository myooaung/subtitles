1
00:00:01,641 --> 00:00:05,641
Our next model is what I call bottom up.

2
00:00:05,641 --> 00:00:06,974
Used to develop detailed estimates.

3
00:00:06,974 --> 00:00:09,641
So we're going to do a little more work here.

4
00:00:09,641 --> 00:00:11,851
It's still done early in the cycle,

5
00:00:11,851 --> 00:00:15,641
but we're going to spend a little more time creating our estimates.

6
00:00:15,641 --> 00:00:18,817
Provides an estimate at the lowest level of WBS.

7
00:00:18,817 --> 00:00:21,926
Remember WBS is a hierarchical set of tasks with

8
00:00:21,926 --> 00:00:23,641
each level going deeper and deeper.

9
00:00:23,641 --> 00:00:27,641
So we may want to go to a deeper level of all the tasks we think we need to do.

10
00:00:27,641 --> 00:00:30,266
Obviously, if we do do that,

11
00:00:30,266 --> 00:00:34,641
we're going to provide much greater accuracy in our estimates.

12
00:00:34,641 --> 00:00:37,483
It's also a good technique for identifying risk factors.

13
00:00:37,483 --> 00:00:40,641
Because you are going to more depths and more detail,

14
00:00:40,641 --> 00:00:43,974
you're going to uncover things you may not in some

15
00:00:43,974 --> 00:00:45,641
of the higher estimating models.

16
00:00:45,641 --> 00:00:48,799
So this is pretty good if you want to really get at

17
00:00:48,799 --> 00:00:50,641
the root of things and avoid risks.

18
00:00:50,641 --> 00:00:53,974
Takes a little additional time of course and the effort to produce,

19
00:00:53,974 --> 00:00:55,641
but I think well worth it.

20
00:00:55,641 --> 00:00:58,935
And I use this model, as I mentioned,

21
00:00:58,935 --> 00:01:03,174
I use all the models for all large projects and then

22
00:01:03,174 --> 00:01:04,774
work them together for my estimates.

23
00:01:04,774 --> 00:01:06,641
But I use bottom up as well.

24
00:01:06,641 --> 00:01:11,858
I have a lot of templates for that so I can easily pull one out

25
00:01:11,858 --> 00:01:14,641
and quickly come up with a good estimate.

26
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,114
So instead of quantifying a unit of work as a simple,

27
00:01:18,114 --> 00:01:20,641
moderate, or complex as we talked about before,

28
00:01:20,641 --> 00:01:22,641
we're going to go into a lot more detail of each one.

29
00:01:22,641 --> 00:01:30,641
So, on the next slide let me show you a simple example of a bottom up estimate.

30
00:01:30,641 --> 00:01:33,641
Here's an example of bottom up.

31
00:01:33,641 --> 00:01:38,641
The WBS of tasks for this project are partially shown below.

32
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:40,746
It's a simple spreadsheet grid of three columns.

33
00:01:40,746 --> 00:01:43,114
You may want to add more columns based on,

34
00:01:43,114 --> 00:01:45,746
you know, what you're trying to do for your project.

35
00:01:45,746 --> 00:01:48,641
In the bold areas I have Project Setup and Delivery Tasks.

36
00:01:48,641 --> 00:01:52,641
And then the next bold area is Development Tasks.

37
00:01:52,641 --> 00:01:55,641
I have Item number, Description, Hours.

38
00:01:55,641 --> 00:01:58,641
So it's a very simple layout.

39
00:01:58,641 --> 00:02:01,041
Let's look at one in particular.

40
00:02:01,041 --> 00:02:01,441
100.

41
00:02:01,441 --> 00:02:04,641
50, this is where we generate QA builds.

42
00:02:04,641 --> 00:02:07,784
I'm going to go ahead and estimate it at 24 hours.

43
00:02:07,784 --> 00:02:10,641
And that's me, say as a project leader doing that.

44
00:02:10,641 --> 00:02:12,328
Then I'm going to sit down with the team.

45
00:02:12,328 --> 00:02:13,641
I'm going to share it with them.

46
00:02:13,641 --> 00:02:15,863
I want them to add tasks, remove tasks,

47
00:02:15,863 --> 00:02:18,641
and adjust any hours that might need to be adjusted,

48
00:02:18,641 --> 00:02:20,641
by their particular level of experience.

49
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:25,641
This spreadsheet could be five pages long and add up to 2, 000 hours, who knows.

50
00:02:25,641 --> 00:02:27,851
That's why we call it bottom up.

51
00:02:27,851 --> 00:02:31,641
We go down to the necessary detail and build up the estimate.

52
00:02:31,641 --> 00:02:35,141
Hey a final note, each time you do one of these,

53
00:02:35,141 --> 00:02:38,323
you will find yourself adding more and more types of

54
00:02:38,323 --> 00:02:40,391
tasks and the tasks themselves.

55
00:02:40,391 --> 00:02:42,578
So just like the PDD,

56
00:02:42,578 --> 00:02:48,641
you will build up the WBS templates to make reuse very easy and

57
00:02:48,641 --> 00:02:58,000
refining your estimating skills a success. Now we're going to move into the estimates that are made during the project.
