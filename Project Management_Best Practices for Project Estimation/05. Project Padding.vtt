00:00:01.290 --> 00:00:02.381
Project padding.

2
00:00:02.381 --> 00:00:04.017
Okay, come clean.

3
00:00:04.017 --> 00:00:07.290
We've all done it, but why?

4
00:00:07.290 --> 00:00:09.990
And is it a good idea?

5
00:00:09.990 --> 00:00:13.140
Is there a right way to pad?

6
00:00:13.140 --> 00:00:16.290
Well, let's find out in this section.

7
00:00:16.290 --> 00:00:17.433
Arbitrary padding.

8
00:00:17.433 --> 00:00:20.290
Let's look at a definition.

9
00:00:20.290 --> 00:00:26.290
Padding is excess time, arbitrarily added to an estimate.

10
00:00:26.290 --> 00:00:29.290
It might look something like this.

11
00:00:29.290 --> 00:00:34.290
This is purely arbitrary padding with no value and no

12
00:00:34.290 --> 00:00:36.290
assumptions in place whatsoever.

13
00:00:36.290 --> 00:00:39.290
Now let's look at an example here.

14
00:00:39.290 --> 00:00:43.598
How long will the system architecture design take?

15
00:00:43.598 --> 00:00:49.353
Hummm, you think to yourself, 8 hours, but heck, let's triple it.

16
00:00:49.353 --> 00:00:50.665
Okay, 24 hours.

17
00:00:50.665 --> 00:00:53.290
Now why do we do this?

18
00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.290
So let's explore in the next slide the reasons why we do arbitrary padding.

19
00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.665
Now here are some reasons why padding is used.

20
00:01:02.665 --> 00:01:05.290
And some might be familiar to you.

21
00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:06.250
Fear of being wrong.

22
00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:07.930
Boy, I've got to give an estimate,

23
00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.290
I don't want to be wrong and I don't want to be too small

24
00:01:11.290 --> 00:01:13.517
I better throw some padding on there.

25
00:01:13.517 --> 00:01:18.290
I might even get in trouble for making another estimate that was not very good.

26
00:01:18.290 --> 00:01:22.343
I just really have no idea how long it will take,

27
00:01:22.343 --> 00:01:25.290
so I'm going to double or triple up.

28
00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:29.290
I'm not even sure what I'm being asked to do.

29
00:01:29.290 --> 00:01:34.290
So what do you usually do in these conditions?

30
00:01:34.290 --> 00:01:39.290
I will just make a guess at the estimate and of course double or triple it.

31
00:01:39.290 --> 00:01:42.059
You mean arbitrary padding of course.

32
00:01:42.059 --> 00:01:50.000
Those are the wrong reasons to pad. Now let's talk about the side effects of arbitrary padding.
