00:00:00,357 --> 00:00:04,732
In this section we will explore developing your team's capacity.

2
00:00:04,732 --> 00:00:10,691
In other words, how much work can they really produce?

3
00:00:10,691 --> 00:00:12,357
Let's see.

4
00:00:12,357 --> 00:00:18,357
Team capacity is incremental and iterative as well.

5
00:00:18,357 --> 00:00:23,357
So our first step is to determine just what our ideal capacity is.

6
00:00:23,357 --> 00:00:23,857
Now,

7
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:31,357
ideal capacity for your team is how many hours of work can your team complete,

8
00:00:31,357 --> 00:00:34,199
in a given ideal time period?

9
00:00:34,199 --> 00:00:37,989
Now in the past we discussed ideal time.

10
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:40,357
So what about ideal capacity?

11
00:00:40,357 --> 00:00:45,357
What is the ideal amount of work the team can produce?

12
00:00:45,357 --> 00:00:47,691
Okay, that's our goal.

13
00:00:47,691 --> 00:00:52,357
Second step though, is let's determine historical capacity.

14
00:00:52,357 --> 00:00:55,080
That's based on, of course, historical actuals.

15
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:57,024
Since we track our time,

16
00:00:57,024 --> 00:01:02,534
we can quickly look at data to determine just how much capacity,

17
00:01:02,534 --> 00:01:08,357
hours of real work, have we as a team historically produced?

18
00:01:08,357 --> 00:01:16,357
And the third step is what I call determine 'pretty good capacity, ' PGC.

19
00:01:16,357 --> 00:01:21,691
That is going to be a very quick and usable indicator to

20
00:01:21,691 --> 00:01:24,357
help us create the team's capacity.

21
00:01:24,357 --> 00:01:29,024
So we are looking for a quick way to go from ideal capacity to

22
00:01:29,024 --> 00:01:32,357
a more realistic capacity in what I call,

23
00:01:32,357 --> 00:01:33,857
'pretty good capacity.

24
00:01:33,857 --> 00:01:40,357
' Now, let's look at some examples on the next slides.

25
00:01:40,357 --> 00:01:44,357
Now let's discuss how to determine ideal capacity.

26
00:01:44,357 --> 00:01:47,024
Scenario, your boss comes to you and says,

27
00:01:47,024 --> 00:01:49,357
doesn't everyone work 40 hours a week?

28
00:01:49,357 --> 00:01:52,299
Well now you're going to have an approach to explain

29
00:01:52,299 --> 00:01:54,357
to him or her what really happens.

30
00:01:54,357 --> 00:01:57,651
So ideally, people work 8 hours per day,

31
00:01:57,651 --> 00:02:01,357
for over 2, 000 hours per year, per person.

32
00:02:01,357 --> 00:02:04,572
Now if you have a team of 3 people,

33
00:02:04,572 --> 00:02:08,500
of course you have an ideal capacity of 3 x 2,

34
00:02:08,500 --> 00:02:11,357
080 for a total of 6, 240 hours.

35
00:02:11,357 --> 00:02:12,357
Ideal capacity.

36
00:02:12,357 --> 00:02:17,357
Now we want to refine that by some known parameters.

37
00:02:17,357 --> 00:02:22,357
Such as paid time off and company holidays.

38
00:02:22,357 --> 00:02:24,982
Between paid time off and company holidays,

39
00:02:24,982 --> 00:02:28,357
we have 184 hours that we are not working.

40
00:02:28,357 --> 00:02:31,080
So let's update our ideal capacity number.

41
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,357
We want to reduce for paid time off by 120 hours.

42
00:02:35,357 --> 00:02:41,357
We also want to reduce that number by 64 for known holidays.

43
00:02:41,357 --> 00:02:46,500
So now our total ideal capacity is only 1,

44
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:52,786
896 hours per year, per person, for a total of 5,

45
00:02:52,786 --> 00:02:53,357
688.

46
00:02:53,357 --> 00:02:57,176
Now you only have to do this maybe once quarter or twice a year,

47
00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,357
because these factors probably won't change a lot.

48
00:02:59,357 --> 00:03:01,691
But if any known parameters,

49
00:03:01,691 --> 00:03:06,357
easy to understand and easy to put into your formulas,

50
00:03:06,357 --> 00:03:10,270
come up in your company, then you can do this.

51
00:03:10,270 --> 00:03:15,757
Also you want to update this at the size of your team changes or

52
00:03:15,757 --> 00:03:19,357
other drivers that we're going to talk about later.

53
00:03:19,357 --> 00:03:23,357
So if in your company or situation, you have other known parameters,

54
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:32,000
apply those and come up with your ideal capacity per person and also, therefore, for your team.
