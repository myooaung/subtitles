00:00:00.674 --> 00:00:02.007
Module summary.

2
00:00:02.007 --> 00:00:06.674
Poor requirements and estimates mean runaway projects.

3
00:00:06.674 --> 00:00:12.007
Lessons learned have shown that these are the two main

4
00:00:12.007 --> 00:00:14.674
causes of poorly executed projects.

5
00:00:14.674 --> 00:00:18.674
Project definition document is your first step to better estimates.

6
00:00:18.674 --> 00:00:23.674
This approach enables a quick way to gather high-level requirements.

7
00:00:23.674 --> 00:00:27.674
Quality estimates set the foundation for accurate project costs.

8
00:00:27.674 --> 00:00:31.407
As we develop incremental and iterative estimates,

9
00:00:31.407 --> 00:00:35.674
our project costs become better understood and trusted.

10
00:00:35.674 --> 00:00:38.341
Level of effort is balanced against risk management.

11
00:00:38.341 --> 00:00:40.007
The amount of time, effort,

12
00:00:40.007 --> 00:00:44.174
and resources to develop the estimate is considered against

13
00:00:44.174 --> 00:00:47.674
how much risk the business can afford.

14
00:00:47.674 --> 00:00:52.674
Quality estimates are essential for task prioritization and staffing resources.

15
00:00:52.674 --> 00:00:57.174
Important for go/no go decisions and the placement of

16
00:00:57.174 --> 00:00:59.674
talent on the right assignments.

17
00:00:59.674 --> 00:01:02.751
Project estimation is a process.

18
00:01:02.751 --> 00:01:04.597
Repeat, predict, improve.

19
00:01:04.597 --> 00:01:07.674
Yes, estimation is a process.

20
00:01:07.674 --> 00:01:11.960
And the better your process, the better the prediction outcomes,

21
00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:13.674
that is your estimates.

22
00:01:13.674 --> 00:01:17.674
Understand your fears of estimation to better overcome them.

23
00:01:17.674 --> 00:01:20.674
If you fear that initial estimate target that no one will ever forget,

24
00:01:20.674 --> 00:01:25.674
then educate your management or customer that estimation is a process.

25
00:01:25.674 --> 00:01:31.674
It is iterative and will be defined as you learn more about the requirements.

26
00:01:31.674 --> 00:01:34.674
Strong communication and people skills are essential.

27
00:01:34.674 --> 00:01:39.674
You need to be able to quickly extract from people the key requirements.

28
00:01:39.674 --> 00:01:41.439
This takes practice and skill,

29
00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:45.986
but will be easier for you if you have an estimating process Know

30
00:01:45.986 --> 00:01:47.861
the difference between budgets and estimates.

31
00:01:47.861 --> 00:01:48.174
Remember,

32
00:01:48.174 --> 00:01:51.924
a budget is all they have to spend and an estimate is an

33
00:01:51.924 --> 00:01:54.674
approximation of what you think it'll take to do the job.

34
00:01:54.674 --> 00:02:01.000
And lastly, thank you very much. We'll see you in the next module.
