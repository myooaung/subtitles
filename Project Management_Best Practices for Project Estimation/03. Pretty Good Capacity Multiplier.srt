1
00:00:00,988 --> 00:00:07,988
Now let's refine our ideal capacity by applying historical capacity data.

2
00:00:07,988 --> 00:00:15,988
To recap, our ideal capacity is 5, 688 hours for our team.

3
00:00:15,988 --> 00:00:20,988
So we want to further refine our ideal capacity by historical parameters.

4
00:00:20,988 --> 00:00:24,845
We want to review our actuals, our historical records,

5
00:00:24,845 --> 00:00:26,988
from our time tracking system.

6
00:00:26,988 --> 00:00:32,988
We also know we have some sick time, seems to be around 40 hours per year.

7
00:00:32,988 --> 00:00:41,170
So now we want to reduce our ideal capacity and refine that down to 1,

8
00:00:41,170 --> 00:00:44,988
856 hours, 40 hours for sick time.

9
00:00:44,988 --> 00:00:50,988
We want to review actuals and average across everyone on the team.

10
00:00:50,988 --> 00:00:59,426
So historical capacity for a work year is 1, 856, for a work week, 35.

11
00:00:59,426 --> 00:00:59,988
17.

12
00:00:59,988 --> 00:01:03,692
And for a work day, we're down to 7 hours.

13
00:01:03,692 --> 00:01:04,062
7.

14
00:01:04,062 --> 00:01:09,988
1 to be exact, but about 7 hours a day is what our team capacity is.

15
00:01:09,988 --> 00:01:13,131
And again, you don't have to do this all the time.

16
00:01:13,131 --> 00:01:15,988
Maybe once a quarter, twice a year, something like that.

17
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:20,988
Also you want to update this if your team size changes as well.

18
00:01:20,988 --> 00:01:28,988
So to summarize, this is how much capacity my team can perform ideal estimates.

19
00:01:28,988 --> 00:01:33,988
To summarize, this is how much capacity my team can produce.

20
00:01:33,988 --> 00:01:39,988
We will talk about elapsed time or team schedules in the next section.

21
00:01:39,988 --> 00:01:44,988
Let's see how we compute a 'pretty good capacity' multiplier.

22
00:01:44,988 --> 00:01:46,988
Here's an example.

23
00:01:46,988 --> 00:01:52,988
We have an ideal time estimate of 454 hours.

24
00:01:52,988 --> 00:01:55,814
Let's determine our PGC multiplier.

25
00:01:55,814 --> 00:01:58,640
We divide 8 by 7.

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:00,336
1, equals 1.

27
00:02:00,336 --> 00:02:00,901
12.

28
00:02:00,901 --> 00:02:05,423
So our multiplier is going to be 1.

29
00:02:05,423 --> 00:02:05,988
12.

30
00:02:05,988 --> 00:02:10,988
What we're saying here is that we can produce 7.

31
00:02:10,988 --> 00:02:16,988
1 real hours of work, with an elapsed time of 8 hours.

32
00:02:16,988 --> 00:02:19,988
It's like our football analogy where we had 60

33
00:02:19,988 --> 00:02:21,988
minutes of production if you will,

34
00:02:21,988 --> 00:02:27,988
within the elapsed time of the game about 3 to 4 hours.

35
00:02:27,988 --> 00:02:34,099
So for each ideal hour of effort, it equates to 1.

36
00:02:34,099 --> 00:02:37,988
12 hours for my team to accomplish.

37
00:02:37,988 --> 00:02:43,988
So now let's convert our ideal estimate to a PGC estimate.

38
00:02:43,988 --> 00:02:46,988
So we multiply the 1.

39
00:02:46,988 --> 00:02:52,988
12 x the 454 hours, to give us 509 hours.

40
00:02:52,988 --> 00:02:55,830
Now the ideal estimate never changes.

41
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:57,725
It's still 454 hours.

42
00:02:57,725 --> 00:02:59,620
What we're saying is,

43
00:02:59,620 --> 00:03:07,702
is that in order to accomplish those 454 hours I need a window,

44
00:03:07,702 --> 00:03:11,988
or elapsed time, of 509 hours.

45
00:03:11,988 --> 00:03:15,488
So if I was going to charge my customer money,

46
00:03:15,488 --> 00:03:18,988
per hour, I'm only going to charge them 454 hours.

47
00:03:18,988 --> 00:03:22,988
But I'm going to tell them my elapsed time will be 509 hours.

48
00:03:22,988 --> 00:03:27,988
So you can see how we're now moving into the

49
00:03:27,988 --> 00:03:30,988
scheduling part of the estimating process.

50
00:03:30,988 --> 00:03:35,877
But it will take a window, or period,

51
00:03:35,877 --> 00:03:41,988
of 509 hours to consume and execute those 454 hours.

52
00:03:41,988 --> 00:03:47,766
So the ideal team capacity is 509 hours.

53
00:03:47,766 --> 00:03:49,933
So remember though,

54
00:03:49,933 --> 00:03:56,988
we know we started with ideal time and that was to clarify the

55
00:03:56,988 --> 00:03:58,988
tasks separate from any extraneous activities.

56
00:03:58,988 --> 00:04:03,604
So now we need to begin applying the predictable parameters,

57
00:04:03,604 --> 00:04:08,373
vacation, company holidays that are truly predictable,

58
00:04:08,373 --> 00:04:15,988
to determine our elapsed time, AKA, our beginning schedule.

59
00:04:15,988 --> 00:04:19,988
Why tracking your time is imperative.

60
00:04:19,988 --> 00:04:25,988
If you track your time then you can measure your team's capacity.

61
00:04:25,988 --> 00:04:28,788
By using the capacity of your team,

62
00:04:28,788 --> 00:04:33,988
you can convert ideal time to elapsed time in the most efficient way.

63
00:04:33,988 --> 00:04:38,388
When you track your time you can use the data for

64
00:04:38,388 --> 00:04:39,988
the historical capacity planning.

65
00:04:39,988 --> 00:04:44,988
If you don't track your time, you've lost two very valuable inputs,

66
00:04:44,988 --> 00:04:48,357
which will affect the quality of your estimates.

67
00:04:48,357 --> 00:04:54,038
And the point of converting from ideal time to elapsed time is to set

68
00:04:54,038 --> 00:04:56,838
the expectations of your management or your customer,

69
00:04:56,838 --> 00:05:01,377
so they really know the real time it takes to get the job done.

70
00:05:01,377 --> 00:05:01,933
And lastly,

71
00:05:01,933 --> 00:05:07,341
I want to emphasize that tracking your team's time on task is just so critical.

72
00:05:07,341 --> 00:05:12,635
The historical data is used and leveraged throughout the

73
00:05:12,635 --> 00:05:14,988
estimating and scheduling process.

74
00:05:14,988 --> 00:05:18,988
So let's summarize determining your team's capacity.

75
00:05:18,988 --> 00:05:22,988
First, determine your team's ideal capacity.

76
00:05:22,988 --> 00:05:25,988
Refine using historical capacity.

77
00:05:25,988 --> 00:05:28,988
Determine your PGC multiplier.

78
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:32,877
These are really easy to do, they do not take a lot of time,

79
00:05:32,877 --> 00:05:33,988
and now you're ready.

80
00:05:33,988 --> 00:05:40,988
Given any ideal estimate you can determine your team's true capacity.

81
00:05:40,988 --> 00:05:44,988
It takes into account known parameters, such as vacation and sick time, etc.

82
00:05:44,988 --> 00:05:49,988
Add more parameters that relate to you and your company's environment.

83
00:05:49,988 --> 00:05:53,680
But always update these parameters regularly to make

84
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:55,988
sure your multipliers are accurate.

85
00:05:55,988 --> 00:06:00,988
Now, what other attributes might affect your team capacity?

86
00:06:00,988 --> 00:06:06,488
Skill sets, training needs, of course team size.

87
00:06:06,488 --> 00:06:17,000
So the next section we'll explore team schedules and how these other attributes play into your scheduling process.
