00:00:00.282 --> 00:00:01.966
Why track your time?

2
00:00:01.966 --> 00:00:08.282
Okay, it helps you determine if your estimate was any good in the first place.

3
00:00:08.282 --> 00:00:13.282
Say task 204 was estimated at 16 hours.

4
00:00:13.282 --> 00:00:15.340
If you're tracking your time,

5
00:00:15.340 --> 00:00:19.046
let's say the actual hours after completing the task,

6
00:00:19.046 --> 00:00:20.282
was 21 hours.

7
00:00:20.282 --> 00:00:22.567
What does this mean?

8
00:00:22.567 --> 00:00:24.282
Poor estimation technique?

9
00:00:24.282 --> 00:00:28.282
Maybe, maybe you need to improve that.

10
00:00:28.282 --> 00:00:30.853
More training needed for the developer?

11
00:00:30.853 --> 00:00:31.282
Maybe.

12
00:00:31.282 --> 00:00:34.282
Maybe you can provide that additional training.

13
00:00:34.282 --> 00:00:39.282
Other issues might be coming around there.

14
00:00:39.282 --> 00:00:44.282
All these are excellent feedback used to improve your estimation process.

15
00:00:44.282 --> 00:00:47.425
So now you can find out just why it took longer.

16
00:00:47.425 --> 00:00:50.282
You can also tell your customer why it took longer.

17
00:00:50.282 --> 00:00:56.282
And everyone can move forward knowing what really happened.

18
00:00:56.282 --> 00:00:59.974
It also helps you track actuals to estimates.

19
00:00:59.974 --> 00:01:02.282
Is your task on track?

20
00:01:02.282 --> 00:01:05.710
Again, task 204 is estimated at 16 hours.

21
00:01:05.710 --> 00:01:10.425
Your developer says he has used 4 hours and is about

22
00:01:10.425 --> 00:01:12.882
30% complete with its functionality.

23
00:01:12.882 --> 00:01:14.482
That is good.

24
00:01:14.482 --> 00:01:16.615
That's ahead of plan.

25
00:01:16.615 --> 00:01:19.282
30% is ahead of plan.

26
00:01:19.282 --> 00:01:22.064
So you can say great, keep on working.

27
00:01:22.064 --> 00:01:27.282
On the next slide we'll take a few more reasons why to track your time.

28
00:01:27.282 --> 00:01:28.666
Other good reasons.

29
00:01:28.666 --> 00:01:33.282
For example, helps you find issues early in your project.

30
00:01:33.282 --> 00:01:36.105
If task 204 was estimated at 16 hours,

31
00:01:36.105 --> 00:01:40.567
and your developer says he has used 12 hours and is about

32
00:01:40.567 --> 00:01:45.282
30% complete with its functionality, well you know that's not good.

33
00:01:45.282 --> 00:01:47.948
Activity is behind plan.

34
00:01:47.948 --> 00:01:55.282
The programmer used 75% of the hours, but only 30% complete.

35
00:01:55.282 --> 00:01:59.282
So maybe you could, you know, take some corrective action.

36
00:01:59.282 --> 00:01:59.615
Also,

37
00:01:59.615 --> 00:02:02.948
by tracking your time it will help you improve future

38
00:02:02.948 --> 00:02:05.752
estimates and your process can be improved.

39
00:02:05.752 --> 00:02:10.282
As we mentioned earlier, it allows you to take corrective action.

40
00:02:10.282 --> 00:02:13.282
Are the requirements more complex than you thought?

41
00:02:13.282 --> 00:02:17.282
Maybe you have to have a better requirements gathering process.

42
00:02:17.282 --> 00:02:18.882
Does the team need more training?

43
00:02:18.882 --> 00:02:21.282
Maybe they need more software training or database training

44
00:02:21.282 --> 00:02:23.948
so they can meet their estimates better.

45
00:02:23.948 --> 00:02:29.282
Or you can add more time based on their skill level in the future.

46
00:02:29.282 --> 00:02:32.337
Was there some other event or issue that caused this person

47
00:02:32.337 --> 00:02:34.282
to take longer than we originally thought?

48
00:02:34.282 --> 00:02:38.407
So the bottom line is it allows you to be proactive,

49
00:02:38.407 --> 00:02:40.282
to remediate any issues early.

50
00:02:40.282 --> 00:02:43.996
You don't want to get to the end of 1, 000 hour project,

51
00:02:43.996 --> 00:02:46.282
only to come in at 1, 200 hours.

52
00:02:46.282 --> 00:02:50.210
You want to know early the little issues that might happen,

53
00:02:50.210 --> 00:02:52.782
correct those issues, educate the stakeholders,

54
00:02:52.782 --> 00:02:55.282
reevaluate, re-estimate, and move forward.

55
00:02:55.282 --> 00:03:02.282
Yep, I've got more reasons why you should track your time, on the next slide.

56
00:03:02.282 --> 00:03:07.337
Another good reason is by tracking your time it will help you develop

57
00:03:07.337 --> 00:03:10.387
low and high estimate brackets for future projects.

58
00:03:10.387 --> 00:03:14.808
So it'll allow us to use our track data for the pre-launch,

59
00:03:14.808 --> 00:03:19.282
top down historical model that we talked about earlier in this module.

60
00:03:19.282 --> 00:03:22.139
It also supports the hybrid model as well.

61
00:03:22.139 --> 00:03:24.282
When we re-estimate based on actuals.

62
00:03:24.282 --> 00:03:26.399
So if we're tracking our time,

63
00:03:26.399 --> 00:03:31.082
we're monitoring what's going on and based on the actual data we can

64
00:03:31.082 --> 00:03:34.682
re-estimate the tasks that have yet to be completed,

65
00:03:34.682 --> 00:03:36.282
based on that data.

66
00:03:36.282 --> 00:03:42.282
It also gives you a solid data for your management or your customer.

67
00:03:42.282 --> 00:03:46.282
You should provide a periodic status report to your customer.

68
00:03:46.282 --> 00:03:48.635
A cost status for example.

69
00:03:48.635 --> 00:03:52.870
We've used 225 hours of a 500 hour project.

70
00:03:52.870 --> 00:03:54.282
I've used 45%.

71
00:03:54.282 --> 00:03:55.082
Schedule status.

72
00:03:55.082 --> 00:03:58.682
We are 6 weeks into a 16 week project.

73
00:03:58.682 --> 00:03:59.482
I'm 37.

74
00:03:59.482 --> 00:04:00.282
5% complete.

75
00:04:00.282 --> 00:04:07.282
Without the tracking of your hours, and the actuals against those estimates,

76
00:04:07.282 --> 00:04:13.282
you'll be unable to provide good, succinct data to your customers.

77
00:04:13.282 --> 00:04:15.870
And you always want to be able to provide a project

78
00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:17.282
summary for your customers as well.

79
00:04:17.282 --> 00:04:18.996
Are you on track?

80
00:04:18.996 --> 00:04:23.282
If not, adjust the estimate and schedule if need be.

81
00:04:23.282 --> 00:04:27.282
Re-estimate and continue to track your time.

82
00:04:27.282 --> 00:04:30.576
Yep, just one more slide, hang in there,

83
00:04:30.576 --> 00:04:34.282
on reasons why you need to track your time.

84
00:04:34.282 --> 00:04:37.615
Here are some more good reasons to track your time.

85
00:04:37.615 --> 00:04:39.282
It'll keep you in business.

86
00:04:39.282 --> 00:04:42.105
So whether you're independent or in corporate America,

87
00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:45.948
tracking your time will be a good best practice to

88
00:04:45.948 --> 00:04:49.282
actually keep you in business.

89
00:04:49.282 --> 00:04:51.948
All managers and team leaders and independent contractors

90
00:04:51.948 --> 00:04:55.139
must regularly report true and valid cost and schedule

91
00:04:55.139 --> 00:04:56.853
information to your customers.

92
00:04:56.853 --> 00:05:00.282
Whether you're in corporate America or you're independent.

93
00:05:00.282 --> 00:05:05.425
And customers will greatly appreciate you and it builds trust and a

94
00:05:05.425 --> 00:05:09.282
long-term relationship therefore a long-term career.

95
00:05:09.282 --> 00:05:12.282
Allows you to compare estimates to actual costs.

96
00:05:12.282 --> 00:05:18.282
Enables you to validate estimates against the actual time and money expended.

97
00:05:18.282 --> 00:05:21.282
It allows you to improve your estimating models.

98
00:05:21.282 --> 00:05:25.996
And lastly allows you to improve your scheduling models as well.

99
00:05:25.996 --> 00:05:33.000
All good things. Now, let's talk about techniques and how to monitor the tracking of your time.
