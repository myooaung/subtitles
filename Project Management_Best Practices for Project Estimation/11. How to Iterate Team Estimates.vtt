WEBVTT
1
00:00:01.004 --> 00:00:07.004
Now if you decided to make an iteration, just how would you make that iteration?

2
00:00:07.004 --> 00:00:10.696
I recommend leveraging the WBS, Work Breakdown Structure,

3
00:00:10.696 --> 00:00:13.004
approach to refine your estimates.

4
00:00:13.004 --> 00:00:20.004
Break each task into subtasks, and subtasks even into more subtasks.

5
00:00:20.004 --> 00:00:23.861
Maximize the estimate per task maybe around 16 hours.

6
00:00:23.861 --> 00:00:26.004
Find what's right for you.

7
00:00:26.004 --> 00:00:28.886
Maybe it's 24, 32, maybe even 8.

8
00:00:28.886 --> 00:00:33.004
But somewhere, 16, 24 seems to be a good range.

9
00:00:33.004 --> 00:00:37.004
Remember the larger the estimate the more assumptions

10
00:00:37.004 --> 00:00:40.004
that might be hidden within it.

11
00:00:40.004 --> 00:00:42.226
Now provide key assumptions next to each task to help

12
00:00:42.226 --> 00:00:46.504
explain why the estimate is what it is, maybe a little note possibly,

13
00:00:46.504 --> 00:00:50.004
to help explain things if that's necessary.

14
00:00:50.004 --> 00:00:51.718
And again, here are the ranges.

15
00:00:51.718 --> 00:00:55.433
Maybe you might want to use 8 to 16, if you're not sure,

16
00:00:55.433 --> 00:01:00.004
you know, you might go lower, go higher.

17
00:01:00.004 --> 00:01:05.004
And then for each one, I like to apply a confidence factor for each task.

18
00:01:05.004 --> 00:01:10.004
If I think a task is 20 hours, I might put next to it I'm 100% confident.

19
00:01:10.004 --> 00:01:13.004
I understand what needs to be done in that task.

20
00:01:13.004 --> 00:01:18.004
Now this is still ideal time thinking, we're not thinking about sick time.

21
00:01:18.004 --> 00:01:21.754
We're thinking of ideal time and the confidence is more

22
00:01:21.754 --> 00:01:24.004
of do you understand the requirements.

23
00:01:24.004 --> 00:01:27.277
It's not the extraneous, peripheral activities,

24
00:01:27.277 --> 00:01:30.004
sick time, vacation, other projects.

25
00:01:30.004 --> 00:01:34.004
We're not thinking about anything that affects elapsed time.

26
00:01:34.004 --> 00:01:38.956
We're looking at an ideal time of say 20 hours and now we're

27
00:01:38.956 --> 00:01:42.004
considering how confident are we in that estimate?

28
00:01:42.004 --> 00:01:44.804
Maybe I'm only 75% confident in the estimate.

29
00:01:44.804 --> 00:01:49.004
Then I'm going to add 25% more hours to the base estimate,

30
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:54.004
to kind of compensate for that lack of confidence.

31
00:01:54.004 --> 00:01:57.204
So a formula is quite easy.

32
00:01:57.204 --> 00:02:02.004
It's 100% minus my confidence equals my IncreaseEstimate percentage.

33
00:02:02.004 --> 00:02:06.804
And I'm going to show you a very detailed example on the

34
00:02:06.804 --> 00:02:10.004
next slide to make sure we understand this.

35
00:02:10.004 --> 00:02:13.004
And here's the WBS example.

36
00:02:13.004 --> 00:02:14.004
Here's are spreadsheet.

37
00:02:14.004 --> 00:02:18.004
So we're using this as one of our iterations and we're going

38
00:02:18.004 --> 00:02:21.004
to put more detail on each of the tasks.

39
00:02:21.004 --> 00:02:23.296
You can see in column 1 I have an Item number.

40
00:02:23.296 --> 00:02:26.893
I just give it a number so we can refer to it easily, like 100.

41
00:02:26.893 --> 00:02:28.671
40 or something like.

42
00:02:28.671 --> 00:02:34.004
I give a description of the tasks, here are the estimated hours.

43
00:02:34.004 --> 00:02:37.004
These are our ideal hours to do the project.

44
00:02:37.004 --> 00:02:40.004
We believe as a team those are the hours.

45
00:02:40.004 --> 00:02:43.656
Then we look at each one in a little more detail and come up

46
00:02:43.656 --> 00:02:46.004
with what do we think our confidence factor is?

47
00:02:46.004 --> 00:02:53.004
And we see some in there at 100%, 80%, 50%, we'll talk more about that later.

48
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:55.886
And lastly will be our confidence estimate.

49
00:02:55.886 --> 00:03:00.004
We adjust our ideal estimate based on our confidence factor.

50
00:03:00.004 --> 00:03:04.004
Now let's look at an example in more detail.

51
00:03:04.004 --> 00:03:06.439
So, if you look at the row 100.

52
00:03:06.439 --> 00:03:11.004
10 in light blue with orange arrows, my estimate is 4 hours for this task.

53
00:03:11.004 --> 00:03:19.004
My confidence is 100%, so my confidence estimate is also 4.

54
00:03:19.004 --> 00:03:22.504
If I look at another line, 100.

55
00:03:22.504 --> 00:03:25.504
40, my estimate is 40 hours.

56
00:03:25.504 --> 00:03:29.004
Notice the confidence factor there is 80%.

57
00:03:29.004 --> 00:03:32.604
So the formula is 100% minus 80% equals 20%.

58
00:03:32.604 --> 00:03:39.004
20% of 40 is 8 hours, so I simply add 8 more hours to my 40.

59
00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:43.425
And you can see that the confidence estimate is now 48 hours,

60
00:03:43.425 --> 00:03:46.004
very simple math, very simple to do.

61
00:03:46.004 --> 00:03:49.320
So now I basically have a range,

62
00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:55.004
between 40 and 48 hours for this particular task in ideal time.

63
00:03:55.004 --> 00:03:57.804
The example below is the same.

64
00:03:57.804 --> 00:03:59.204
On line 100.

65
00:03:59.204 --> 00:04:02.004
50, my estimate is 40 hours.

66
00:04:02.004 --> 00:04:06.004
I'm not very confident on this one, I'm thinking maybe 50%.

67
00:04:06.004 --> 00:04:07.913
I may need to do more analysis.

68
00:04:07.913 --> 00:04:12.004
I may need to do more research on what this task might take to do.

69
00:04:12.004 --> 00:04:17.504
In the meantime, basically I add 50% more to the ideal estimate,

70
00:04:17.504 --> 00:04:23.004
so now I go from 40 to 60 by adding 20 hours.

71
00:04:23.004 --> 00:04:24.846
And the last line, the total line,

72
00:04:24.846 --> 00:04:28.004
you can see based on the confidence factor and the confidence estimate,

73
00:04:28.004 --> 00:04:31.822
I now have a range of hours.

74
00:04:31.822 --> 00:04:40.004
So my ideal time for this project is ranging between 411 hours and 454 hours.

75
00:04:40.004 --> 00:04:41.871
Again, ideal time range.

76
00:04:41.871 --> 00:04:46.537
These are still ideal estimates based on requirements and the

77
00:04:46.537 --> 00:04:49.504
confidence that we understand the requirements,

78
00:04:49.504 --> 00:04:54.004
not the other unpredictable factors we talked about before,

79
00:04:54.004 --> 00:04:57.004
such as the issues related to elapsed time.

80
00:04:57.004 --> 00:04:59.337
This is still ideal time,

81
00:04:59.337 --> 00:05:04.004
based on the confidence of the knowledge of the requirements.

82
00:05:04.004 --> 00:05:07.004
So to summarize this section on team estimation,

83
00:05:07.004 --> 00:05:10.004
let's talk about some best practices you could share with your team.

84
00:05:10.004 --> 00:05:15.004
Always request estimates in ideal time, always.

85
00:05:15.004 --> 00:05:20.004
You need to provide guidance to the person giving the estimate as follows.

86
00:05:20.004 --> 00:05:24.004
You will only be working on this one thing.

87
00:05:24.004 --> 00:05:26.004
Everything you need will be on hand.

88
00:05:26.004 --> 00:05:29.004
There will be no interruptions.

89
00:05:29.004 --> 00:05:30.290
Do not pad.

90
00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:35.004
In other words, don't add any additional hours to any estimate.

91
00:05:35.004 --> 00:05:39.004
Now given those ideal assumptions, what is your estimate of the task?

92
00:05:39.004 --> 00:05:44.004
Believe it or not this takes a lot of training of your people.

93
00:05:44.004 --> 00:05:47.379
It's very challenging for them to think of ideal

94
00:05:47.379 --> 00:05:50.004
estimates because the world is not perfect.

95
00:05:50.004 --> 00:05:55.004
But with enough coaching and enough trust and confidence, you will get there.

96
00:05:55.004 --> 00:05:59.122
The result of course will be a clean, crisp, estimate.

97
00:05:59.122 --> 00:06:04.828
And we'll see later in these sections what we do to that in order to

98
00:06:04.828 --> 00:06:08.004
come up with our elapse time and our schedules.

99
00:06:08.004 --> 00:06:12.004
And also, a reasonable size of estimate.

100
00:06:12.004 --> 00:06:14.846
You know, what does this task take to do?

101
00:06:14.846 --> 00:06:18.004
We want a good number in there that looks reasonable,

102
00:06:18.004 --> 00:06:23.004
understandable, and actionable for every single task.

103
00:06:23.004 --> 00:06:26.277
So at the end of iteration you're going to make a decision,

104
00:06:26.277 --> 00:06:29.004
which will be is this estimate good enough for now?

105
00:06:29.004 --> 00:06:31.337
Great, no need to go on further,

106
00:06:31.337 --> 00:06:35.004
based on the context and the cycle of that estimating iteration

107
00:06:35.004 --> 00:06:39.004
and who is the receiver of these estimates.

108
00:06:39.004 --> 00:06:41.004
If you need more detail, then go deeper.

109
00:06:41.004 --> 00:06:44.004
Do a bottom up estimate with a spreadsheet and drill

110
00:06:44.004 --> 00:06:48.004
in and put more meat on the bones.

111
00:06:48.004 --> 00:06:54.000
In the next section we're going to be talking about how to develop team capacity.
