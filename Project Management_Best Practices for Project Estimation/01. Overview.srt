Hello.

2
00:00:00,667 --> 00:00:04,000
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:09,714
I will be presenting Module 4, Agile Estimation,

4
00:00:09,714 --> 00:00:14,000
of Best Practices for Project Estimation.

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:21,000
Let's recap the course and then I'll give you an overview of this module.

6
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,000
Let's do a quick review of the module roadmap.

7
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:30,000
In the first module we learned about the fundamentals of project estimation.

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,286
In the second and third module we learned about several practical tools

9
00:00:34,286 --> 00:00:39,000
and techniques to help you develop your estimates.

10
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,750
And in this module we will provide some context in how estimates

11
00:00:42,750 --> 00:00:46,462
are derived and used in an Agile environment.

12
00:00:46,462 --> 00:00:52,000
Okay, now let's do an overview of this module.

13
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:57,000
This module will discuss the Agile philosophy and its approach to estimation.

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,000
Okay, here are the key topics I will be covering.

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:02,000
Agile philosophy.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,000
Agile myths.

17
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,000
The adaptive approach.

18
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:10,182
The Agile approach to projects.

19
00:01:10,182 --> 00:01:14,000
Just the right amount of planning.

20
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,000
Old thinking versus new thinking.

21
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:20,250
Estimation scales.

22
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:22,500
Planning poker.

23
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:27,000
Benefits of Agile estimation.

24
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:31,000
Step by step, creating an Agile estimate.

25
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:34,000
Iterations, velocity, and schedules.

26
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:41,000
And best practice framework. Okay, let's get started.
