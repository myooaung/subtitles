1
00:00:01,321 --> 00:00:05,696
Arbitrary padding is never a good idea.

2
00:00:05,696 --> 00:00:06,321
Never.

3
00:00:06,321 --> 00:00:11,321
And later we're going to talk about managed padding, what I call good padding.

4
00:00:11,321 --> 00:00:14,321
Now let's dive into arbitrary padding.

5
00:00:14,321 --> 00:00:16,426
It affects the performance of the development team.

6
00:00:16,426 --> 00:00:20,321
If you're just throwing padding and hours on here and there why should they

7
00:00:20,321 --> 00:00:24,321
take any care in making a good estimate or a good schedule?

8
00:00:24,321 --> 00:00:29,775
So it supports the negative response of "who cares anyway?

9
00:00:29,775 --> 00:00:34,321
" It also affects the motivation of people on the team.

10
00:00:34,321 --> 00:00:37,794
The type of developers you want on your team will get

11
00:00:37,794 --> 00:00:40,321
bored if there is little sense of urgency,

12
00:00:40,321 --> 00:00:45,321
structure, organization, or quality in your estimates and schedules.

13
00:00:45,321 --> 00:00:50,321
It also generates a lot of distrust among other stakeholders.

14
00:00:50,321 --> 00:00:53,383
Other people, such as your management team,

15
00:00:53,383 --> 00:00:54,258
your customers,

16
00:00:54,258 --> 00:00:57,598
possible other business units in your company who

17
00:00:57,598 --> 00:00:59,821
look to you and your team as well,

18
00:00:59,821 --> 00:01:02,321
their estimates are always wrong and they're always padding.

19
00:01:02,321 --> 00:01:05,321
They can't trust you, therefore the distrust.

20
00:01:05,321 --> 00:01:07,892
"They, IT, always exaggerate the numbers.

21
00:01:07,892 --> 00:01:12,321
" You do not want to have a perception like that.

22
00:01:12,321 --> 00:01:17,321
In the next slide we have a few more side effects.

23
00:01:17,321 --> 00:01:21,321
Now here are a few more downsides to arbitrary padding.

24
00:01:21,321 --> 00:01:25,013
It doesn't contribute positively to the bottom line

25
00:01:25,013 --> 00:01:27,321
of the product being developed.

26
00:01:27,321 --> 00:01:31,321
And this ultimately affects everyone's success.

27
00:01:31,321 --> 00:01:33,265
If you paid too much, for example,

28
00:01:33,265 --> 00:01:36,321
do you need to hire more people to complete that task?

29
00:01:36,321 --> 00:01:40,373
And if you're not sure what that padding or buffering is,

30
00:01:40,373 --> 00:01:43,321
how could you possibly hire the right people?

31
00:01:43,321 --> 00:01:47,258
So in software development, as we kind of know,

32
00:01:47,258 --> 00:01:50,321
work expands to fill the available space.

33
00:01:50,321 --> 00:01:52,654
There won't be that sense of urgency,

34
00:01:52,654 --> 00:01:55,321
people may be working a more unstructured approach

35
00:01:55,321 --> 00:01:57,139
than a more structured approach.

36
00:01:57,139 --> 00:01:59,321
I don't like that at all.

37
00:01:59,321 --> 00:02:02,058
The more time one allocates to a task the more time it will

38
00:02:02,058 --> 00:02:03,321
take to effectively complete that task.

39
00:02:03,321 --> 00:02:05,475
I really believe that.

40
00:02:05,475 --> 00:02:07,628
I really want, expect,

41
00:02:07,628 --> 00:02:12,085
and demand clearly defined tasks with absolute estimates to drive

42
00:02:12,085 --> 00:02:15,968
the team forward and be successful and build trust in those

43
00:02:15,968 --> 00:02:18,987
stakeholders so we can all be successful.

44
00:02:18,987 --> 00:02:24,321
Now let's address what I call good padding in the next slide.

45
00:02:24,321 --> 00:02:26,628
Managed padding, or good padding.

46
00:02:26,628 --> 00:02:30,321
Let's look at a definition of managed padding.

47
00:02:30,321 --> 00:02:35,968
It's time added, proportional to the risk and impacts of the project.

48
00:02:35,968 --> 00:02:38,321
Also known as a buffer.

49
00:02:38,321 --> 00:02:45,321
Also known as good padding, because I want to say it's thoughtful padding.

50
00:02:45,321 --> 00:02:48,013
Padding has a negative meaning of course.

51
00:02:48,013 --> 00:02:50,321
So let's use the term buffer.

52
00:02:50,321 --> 00:02:52,892
This isn't just for semantics either.

53
00:02:52,892 --> 00:02:56,321
But to mean managed, thoughtful padding or buffering,

54
00:02:56,321 --> 00:02:58,167
rather than arbitrary padding.

55
00:02:58,167 --> 00:03:01,859
And it's important to understand the distinction between

56
00:03:01,859 --> 00:03:07,321
arbitrary and thoughtful and managed padding.

57
00:03:07,321 --> 00:03:13,321
So, as I said, it's not arbitrary, it's thought through in the following way.

58
00:03:13,321 --> 00:03:16,321
Use the percentage confidence technique for example.

59
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:21,373
If you are 80% confident in your total estimate for a project,

60
00:03:21,373 --> 00:03:27,321
maybe add 20% as a buffer estimate to the estimates itself or to the schedule.

61
00:03:27,321 --> 00:03:33,171
So if you're estimate is 1, 000 hours, maybe you add 200 hours,

62
00:03:33,171 --> 00:03:36,321
as a buffer, to the 1200 hours.

63
00:03:36,321 --> 00:03:40,556
And maybe your rule is something like 100% minus your confidence factor,

64
00:03:40,556 --> 00:03:42,321
equals the buffer to add.

65
00:03:42,321 --> 00:03:46,556
So we're going to 100%, minus 80% equals 20%.

66
00:03:46,556 --> 00:03:50,321
Now again, you're doing this with some assumptions.

67
00:03:50,321 --> 00:03:51,921
You're going to say,

68
00:03:51,921 --> 00:03:56,321
I'm using this confidence factor because I may lose a resource,

69
00:03:56,321 --> 00:03:58,071
I hear rumor he's leaving the company,

70
00:03:58,071 --> 00:04:00,721
there are two other new projects in the hopper that

71
00:04:00,721 --> 00:04:04,321
might come against this project, it might take resources.

72
00:04:04,321 --> 00:04:06,987
There's a reorganization going on.

73
00:04:06,987 --> 00:04:10,187
So, you are thinking through thoughtfully,

74
00:04:10,187 --> 00:04:14,654
writing down these assumptions so when you present back to management,

75
00:04:14,654 --> 00:04:18,321
they know clearly why you've put this padding or buffering on.

76
00:04:18,321 --> 00:04:24,321
It isn't just an arbitrary, out of thin air padding.

77
00:04:24,321 --> 00:04:26,380
So this will be your reserve estimate.

78
00:04:26,380 --> 00:04:31,946
In other words the team is still going to drive towards the original goal of 1,

79
00:04:31,946 --> 00:04:32,821
000 hours.

80
00:04:32,821 --> 00:04:36,321
And you, as a project manager or leader,

81
00:04:36,321 --> 00:04:40,742
know that you have 200 hours of buffer you might be able to manage,

82
00:04:40,742 --> 00:04:44,196
or play with based on the other extraneous

83
00:04:44,196 --> 00:04:47,321
activities swirling around your project.

84
00:04:47,321 --> 00:04:54,732
Now let's look at some best practices to guide the development of your buffers,

85
00:04:54,732 --> 00:04:56,321
or managed padding.

86
00:04:56,321 --> 00:04:57,571
Determining your buffer.

87
00:04:57,571 --> 00:05:01,321
Here is some best practices for determining your buffer.

88
00:05:01,321 --> 00:05:06,321
Use expert judgment and templates in developing your estimates.

89
00:05:06,321 --> 00:05:08,909
So you really know what's going on and you really understand

90
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,203
the deep assumptions of your project and your customer and

91
00:05:12,203 --> 00:05:14,556
other projects around your project,

92
00:05:14,556 --> 00:05:18,321
or other things that could affect your project.

93
00:05:18,321 --> 00:05:22,321
Use subject matter experts to provide valuable inputs.

94
00:05:22,321 --> 00:05:26,412
You don't know it all and these people may not even be on your team,

95
00:05:26,412 --> 00:05:29,921
but they may be other business leads or other IT experts

96
00:05:29,921 --> 00:05:34,321
you might want to pull in to better understand the effect

97
00:05:34,321 --> 00:05:36,321
of your project against those.

98
00:05:36,321 --> 00:05:37,821
Again, good padding,

99
00:05:37,821 --> 00:05:44,321
only by project manager at the project level or as a team activity.

100
00:05:44,321 --> 00:05:45,900
Again, it's not arbitrary padding,

101
00:05:45,900 --> 00:05:50,005
you must put on good padding or good buffering and write down the

102
00:05:50,005 --> 00:05:53,013
assumptions that drive that additional padding.

103
00:05:53,013 --> 00:05:57,321
And explain that to your management or customer.

104
00:05:57,321 --> 00:05:59,321
Build trust, not distrust.

105
00:05:59,321 --> 00:06:03,321
Use estimating techniques to help develop your buffers.

106
00:06:03,321 --> 00:06:06,321
That we've talked about in the past.

107
00:06:06,321 --> 00:06:11,398
And the idea of range of estimates or range of schedules.

108
00:06:11,398 --> 00:06:12,321
Confidence factors.

109
00:06:12,321 --> 00:06:16,210
Those kinds of little techniques will really help you better

110
00:06:16,210 --> 00:06:19,321
pinpoint the buffering or padding that you need.

111
00:06:19,321 --> 00:06:23,654
And then understand your company's entire project portfolio and the

112
00:06:23,654 --> 00:06:28,321
impacts across those projects with your project.

113
00:06:28,321 --> 00:06:30,321
I've mentioned tracking your time many times.

114
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:38,000
In the next section I will address just how important this best practice is to your success.
