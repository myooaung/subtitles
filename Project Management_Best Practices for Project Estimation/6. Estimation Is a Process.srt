1
00:00:00,658 --> 00:00:05,112
Making estimating easy, or at least easier.

2
00:00:05,112 --> 00:00:07,658
Estimates must be iterative.

3
00:00:07,658 --> 00:00:10,158
An initial, high-level guestimate if you will,

4
00:00:10,158 --> 00:00:12,658
or approximation is what we're looking for.

5
00:00:12,658 --> 00:00:15,184
Followed by one or more iteration of estimates.

6
00:00:15,184 --> 00:00:18,658
This is what the PDD is for that we talked about,

7
00:00:18,658 --> 00:00:20,476
the Project Definition Document,

8
00:00:20,476 --> 00:00:24,229
to help us quickly gather high-level requirements and

9
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:27,658
come up with an initial approximation.

10
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:30,158
Estimates must be continually refined.

11
00:00:30,158 --> 00:00:34,658
As more data is collected, requirements are more understood.

12
00:00:34,658 --> 00:00:37,872
So your first cut estimate is much different than

13
00:00:37,872 --> 00:00:39,658
your formal and final estimate.

14
00:00:39,658 --> 00:00:42,658
Lastly, in order to be successful,

15
00:00:42,658 --> 00:00:46,158
at creating quality estimates you need process,

16
00:00:46,158 --> 00:00:47,658
templates, and tools.

17
00:00:47,658 --> 00:00:51,658
As we'll go through in the following module.

18
00:00:51,658 --> 00:00:55,658
So continuing from the last slide, making estimating easier,

19
00:00:55,658 --> 00:00:59,324
we need to have a solid planning and estimating best practice.

20
00:00:59,324 --> 00:01:00,658
And here it is.

21
00:01:00,658 --> 00:01:04,658
We develop a process, and we're going to do that in the next module.

22
00:01:04,658 --> 00:01:07,834
This process will be a solid planning and estimating

23
00:01:07,834 --> 00:01:10,658
process to use with your team and management.

24
00:01:10,658 --> 00:01:13,184
We're going to document the process,

25
00:01:13,184 --> 00:01:18,658
document the process and train your team on its process how it works.

26
00:01:18,658 --> 00:01:20,845
And why are we doing all this?

27
00:01:20,845 --> 00:01:23,658
There are great benefits of an optimal planning process.

28
00:01:23,658 --> 00:01:25,658
It's going to reduce risk to the business, which is important.

29
00:01:25,658 --> 00:01:30,658
It's going to reduce uncertainty of the business requirements.

30
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,658
We're going to dig in and iterate and better understand them.

31
00:01:33,658 --> 00:01:37,943
Enhances better decision making of where we're going to spend our money,

32
00:01:37,943 --> 00:01:38,658
time, resources.

33
00:01:38,658 --> 00:01:40,220
Establishes trust with your customers.

34
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:43,345
This is paramount and probably one of the most important

35
00:01:43,345 --> 00:01:46,658
aspects of a good estimation process.

36
00:01:46,658 --> 00:01:50,658
We convey customer's expectations by what we write in our

37
00:01:50,658 --> 00:01:52,658
planning documents and our estimates.

38
00:01:52,658 --> 00:01:56,658
And we have it sufficiently reliable for business

39
00:01:56,658 --> 00:01:59,658
leaders to make good decisions from.

40
00:01:59,658 --> 00:02:04,033
We talked about a lot of estimating activities and process

41
00:02:04,033 --> 00:02:06,658
and philosophies and fundamentals so far.

42
00:02:06,658 --> 00:02:08,717
But are you up for the job?

43
00:02:08,717 --> 00:02:12,042
Not every software engineer is cut out to be proficient at

44
00:02:12,042 --> 00:02:13,965
gathering requirements and developing estimates.

45
00:02:13,965 --> 00:02:16,658
It just may not be your thing.

46
00:02:16,658 --> 00:02:20,258
You need to have strong communication and people skills.

47
00:02:20,258 --> 00:02:21,458
In my experiences,

48
00:02:21,458 --> 00:02:28,058
those two skills are much more important to quality estimates than say,

49
00:02:28,058 --> 00:02:28,658
C#.

50
00:02:28,658 --> 00:02:33,372
You need to have the ability of extracting true business requirements.

51
00:02:33,372 --> 00:02:34,658
That's very essential.

52
00:02:34,658 --> 00:02:38,658
You need to have good business acumen and a solid technical foundation.

53
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:41,599
But if you did come from a software engineering background,

54
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:43,658
you have half the picture right there.

55
00:02:43,658 --> 00:02:44,769
You have that good,

56
00:02:44,769 --> 00:02:47,824
solid technical foundation and all you need now then is to

57
00:02:47,824 --> 00:02:49,908
learn more about gathering requirements,

58
00:02:49,908 --> 00:02:53,658
making estimates, and working with people.

59
00:02:53,658 --> 00:02:57,658
Know the business requirements you're estimating as much as possible.

60
00:02:57,658 --> 00:03:01,213
Again, it will be iterative and over time,

61
00:03:01,213 --> 00:03:05,658
but as you build that business domain, that's really important.

62
00:03:05,658 --> 00:03:09,515
You need to possess a decisive character to confidently

63
00:03:09,515 --> 00:03:13,880
and quickly arrive at results while not having all the

64
00:03:13,880 --> 00:03:15,658
necessary information at hand.

65
00:03:15,658 --> 00:03:21,658
I find this character that's somewhat challenging for some software engineers.

66
00:03:21,658 --> 00:03:26,070
They tend to want to know it all, in other words know all the facts,

67
00:03:26,070 --> 00:03:28,658
know everything before they're comfortable making an estimate.

68
00:03:28,658 --> 00:03:32,658
You're going to need to be able to live in a world

69
00:03:32,658 --> 00:03:34,658
where you are a bit uncomfortable.

70
00:03:34,658 --> 00:03:38,658
And you have some soft estimates in there and then you iterate to improve.

71
00:03:38,658 --> 00:03:39,158
Lastly,

72
00:03:39,158 --> 00:03:44,658
able to gauge and adapt to changing requirements and customer expectations.

73
00:03:44,658 --> 00:03:48,391
Customers and users are always changing their mind.

74
00:03:48,391 --> 00:03:56,000
Business is dynamic, requirements are always changing. Therefore, customer expectations are always changing.
