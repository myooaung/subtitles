1
00:00:00,627 --> 00:00:03,627
Runaway projects.

2
00:00:03,627 --> 00:00:10,294
Two of the most common causes of runaway projects are,

3
00:00:10,294 --> 00:00:13,627
poor requirements and poor estimation.

4
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:19,627
Poor requirements and poor estimations drive runaway projects.

5
00:00:19,627 --> 00:00:20,699
By the way,

6
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:23,913
I have another Pluralsight course on Best Practices for

7
00:00:23,913 --> 00:00:26,502
Requirements Gathering that addresses the other piece to

8
00:00:26,502 --> 00:00:28,065
the puzzle of runaway projects.

9
00:00:28,065 --> 00:00:29,627
You might check it out.

10
00:00:29,627 --> 00:00:33,745
So getting a handle on developing quality requirements is very

11
00:00:33,745 --> 00:00:36,627
important to helping you create quality estimates.

12
00:00:36,627 --> 00:00:41,627
Requirements gathering and estimation go hand in hand and are tightly coupled.

13
00:00:41,627 --> 00:00:46,627
Here's the typical estimating process that you've probably experienced yourself.

14
00:00:46,627 --> 00:00:49,294
You're in the middle in the blue shirt.

15
00:00:49,294 --> 00:00:53,627
On your right is the CEO and on your left is the CFO.

16
00:00:53,627 --> 00:00:59,627
Chief Executive Office, Chief Financial Officer, oh great.

17
00:00:59,627 --> 00:01:05,627
The CEO says, I need an estimate for this project, now!

18
00:01:05,627 --> 00:01:07,627
I have no idea!

19
00:01:07,627 --> 00:01:10,627
I don't even know the requirements.

20
00:01:10,627 --> 00:01:12,961
Don't worry, says the CFO.

21
00:01:12,961 --> 00:01:15,761
I won't hold you to it.

22
00:01:15,761 --> 00:01:17,627
Oh, help us all.

23
00:01:17,627 --> 00:01:20,804
I'm sure you've all experienced that.

24
00:01:20,804 --> 00:01:26,627
And so this course will help you work through that situation.

25
00:01:26,627 --> 00:01:30,627
You may have been assigned to provide the estimates for this project.

26
00:01:30,627 --> 00:01:33,627
But really, who's making these estimates anyway?

27
00:01:33,627 --> 00:01:34,166
Problem.

28
00:01:34,166 --> 00:01:40,627
Estimates are done by management or marketing and maybe not by you.

29
00:01:40,627 --> 00:01:43,627
Many times the subject matter experts are not involved.

30
00:01:43,627 --> 00:01:47,913
The people that are closest to the business and the

31
00:01:47,913 --> 00:01:49,627
implementation must be involved.

32
00:01:49,627 --> 00:01:50,101
Solution.

33
00:01:50,101 --> 00:01:52,943
Build trust, have an estimation process,

34
00:01:52,943 --> 00:01:58,627
and earn your place as the go to person for making estimates.

35
00:01:58,627 --> 00:02:03,568
It is up to you to be assertive and proactive and assume

36
00:02:03,568 --> 00:02:05,627
control of the estimation process.

37
00:02:05,627 --> 00:02:08,627
Don't let it control you.

38
00:02:08,627 --> 00:02:09,183
Problem.

39
00:02:09,183 --> 00:02:13,627
Estimates are rarely adjusted as the project proceeds.

40
00:02:13,627 --> 00:02:19,627
Once a number is thrown out there, it seems to unfortunately stick.

41
00:02:19,627 --> 00:02:20,127
Solution.

42
00:02:20,127 --> 00:02:23,627
Estimation must be iterative to be successful.

43
00:02:23,627 --> 00:02:27,627
Work and educate management on the benefits of this approach.

44
00:02:27,627 --> 00:02:33,461
This may mean giving management presentations on your estimation process,

45
00:02:33,461 --> 00:02:34,627
for example.

46
00:02:34,627 --> 00:02:40,082
Management buy-in to an iterative estimation process is critical and

47
00:02:40,082 --> 00:02:43,355
required for improving the quality of estimates.

48
00:02:43,355 --> 00:02:45,627
This is a biggie everyone.

49
00:02:45,627 --> 00:02:49,320
You will need to work with managers and leaders to secure their

50
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:52,627
buy-in to your process and philosophy of estimation.

51
00:02:52,627 --> 00:03:01,627
This will make your life as a project manager or planner much, much easier.

52
00:03:01,627 --> 00:03:03,315
Estimate versus budget.

53
00:03:03,315 --> 00:03:10,627
As a PM or lead you may be requested to provide an estimate.

54
00:03:10,627 --> 00:03:13,469
You also may be told what the estimate is.

55
00:03:13,469 --> 00:03:13,785
Huh?

56
00:03:13,785 --> 00:03:16,627
You're going to be told what the estimate is?

57
00:03:16,627 --> 00:03:19,627
I thought that was your job to create the estimate?

58
00:03:19,627 --> 00:03:23,565
Typically though, when you're told the estimate,

59
00:03:23,565 --> 00:03:28,627
it is really the budget that they're telling you.

60
00:03:28,627 --> 00:03:29,781
Let's define budget.

61
00:03:29,781 --> 00:03:33,243
A fixed amount of money allocated for a particular

62
00:03:33,243 --> 00:03:36,627
purpose such as IT or capital expenditures.

63
00:03:36,627 --> 00:03:42,484
So basically what they're saying is, is this is all I have to spend right now,

64
00:03:42,484 --> 00:03:43,627
so make it fit.

65
00:03:43,627 --> 00:03:47,627
The definition of an estimate is an estimate or approximation,

66
00:03:47,627 --> 00:03:51,627
which is a value that is usable for some purpose.

67
00:03:51,627 --> 00:03:54,627
So when you return to give your estimate to management,

68
00:03:54,627 --> 00:03:59,627
there will likely be a gap between the budget and the estimate.

69
00:03:59,627 --> 00:04:03,264
And typically the estimate will be greater than the budget.

70
00:04:03,264 --> 00:04:03,627
Right?

71
00:04:03,627 --> 00:04:10,627
This course will provide the tools and the techniques to negotiate the gap trap.

72
00:04:10,627 --> 00:04:12,039
Fears of estimating.

73
00:04:12,039 --> 00:04:14,392
Yes, we all have them.

74
00:04:14,392 --> 00:04:18,627
Let's see if any of these resonate with you.

75
00:04:18,627 --> 00:04:21,127
Initial estimates become the target estimate.

76
00:04:21,127 --> 00:04:26,627
Once someone hears that magic number, they seem to never forget it.

77
00:04:26,627 --> 00:04:27,627
Do they?

78
00:04:27,627 --> 00:04:32,627
Failed estimates, failed projects that is, in the past.

79
00:04:32,627 --> 00:04:37,627
I've never given a good one before, so I doubt this one is any good either.

80
00:04:37,627 --> 00:04:39,427
Job insecurity, job security.

81
00:04:39,427 --> 00:04:46,627
I don't want to be fired so I better make it big â€” pad, pad, pad.

82
00:04:46,627 --> 00:04:52,627
Later we'll talk about padding and why that is not good to do in general.

83
00:04:52,627 --> 00:04:53,550
Fist time project.

84
00:04:53,550 --> 00:04:56,627
If this kind of project has never been done before,

85
00:04:56,627 --> 00:05:02,627
it is really hard to make an estimate because there may be a lot of unknowns.

86
00:05:02,627 --> 00:05:05,627
Here are a few more fears to share with you.

87
00:05:05,627 --> 00:05:08,127
Unclear or improper work definition.

88
00:05:08,127 --> 00:05:10,627
We talked about that before.

89
00:05:10,627 --> 00:05:15,627
Poor requirements make quality estimates almost impossible.

90
00:05:15,627 --> 00:05:17,227
A moving target.

91
00:05:17,227 --> 00:05:23,627
If requirements keep changing, how can I possibly make a good estimate?

92
00:05:23,627 --> 00:05:24,396
Customer expectations.

93
00:05:24,396 --> 00:05:26,704
Don't they always want it all?

94
00:05:26,704 --> 00:05:28,627
Sometimes customers want it all,

95
00:05:28,627 --> 00:05:33,627
hence a large estimate is just around the corner.

96
00:05:33,627 --> 00:05:36,440
Plus there are other things you just can't control.

97
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:38,627
The economy, budgets, people, life in general.

98
00:05:38,627 --> 00:05:47,000
This course will help give you the confidence to overcome those fears to produce quality estimates.
