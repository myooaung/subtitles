1
00:00:00,592 --> 00:00:06,592
Next, estimate the size using story points, the size of the user story.

2
00:00:06,592 --> 00:00:10,855
Story points are a unit of measure for expressing

3
00:00:10,855 --> 00:00:15,592
the overall size of a user story, feature or task.

4
00:00:15,592 --> 00:00:17,434
Remember in the other modules,

5
00:00:17,434 --> 00:00:22,592
we used more time-based units of measure such as hours and days and weeks.

6
00:00:22,592 --> 00:00:26,709
And in the Agile approach we were considering using planning

7
00:00:26,709 --> 00:00:29,592
poker to develop those story point estimates.

8
00:00:29,592 --> 00:00:32,592
Remember those are abstract values.

9
00:00:32,592 --> 00:00:38,592
And each item or feature is assigned that abstract value or relative value.

10
00:00:38,592 --> 00:00:42,121
The actual value is not relevant, only the relative values.

11
00:00:42,121 --> 00:00:46,020
So for example, let's say I have three user stories below.

12
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,592
And I just used the template to make it simple.

13
00:00:49,592 --> 00:00:54,592
And the value of the first one is 8, the next one is 13, and the next one is 50.

14
00:00:54,592 --> 00:00:58,823
So in this step we had three user stories and through

15
00:00:58,823 --> 00:01:03,955
planning poker we came up with three estimates,

16
00:01:03,955 --> 00:01:07,592
one for each user story.

17
00:01:07,592 --> 00:01:13,592
Next we want to prioritize our user stories by looking at the point values.

18
00:01:13,592 --> 00:01:17,529
So using planning poker we have derived the following

19
00:01:17,529 --> 00:01:20,592
Agile estimates featured below, in the list.

20
00:01:20,592 --> 00:01:23,092
Provision and new customer, 8 points.

21
00:01:23,092 --> 00:01:25,592
Enable the shopping chart, 13 points.

22
00:01:25,592 --> 00:01:28,592
Enable payment with credit cards, 20 points, etc.

23
00:01:28,592 --> 00:01:32,298
So that is the outcome of the planning poker.

24
00:01:32,298 --> 00:01:35,592
Now in this step we want to prioritize.

25
00:01:35,592 --> 00:01:39,746
So what I've shown below is the priority list.

26
00:01:39,746 --> 00:01:41,592
So through further discussions,

27
00:01:41,592 --> 00:01:44,053
including your customer and other subject matter experts,

28
00:01:44,053 --> 00:01:45,592
you're going to prioritize these.

29
00:01:45,592 --> 00:01:48,768
So now instead of the bullets, I have numbers.

30
00:01:48,768 --> 00:01:51,592
So number 1, is Provision a new customer.

31
00:01:51,592 --> 00:01:53,814
Enable the shopping cart, etc.

32
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:59,592
So this is the order of implementation that is important to the customer.

33
00:01:59,592 --> 00:02:06,539
Now let's see what the iterations are and how we put these

34
00:02:06,539 --> 00:02:10,592
prioritized items together in the next slide.

35
00:02:10,592 --> 00:02:15,121
A key part of any work is to deliver software based

36
00:02:15,121 --> 00:02:17,592
on the priorities of the customer.

37
00:02:17,592 --> 00:02:20,434
So what I've shown here is a simple chart,

38
00:02:20,434 --> 00:02:23,592
Iteration #1 on the left, Iteration #2 on the right.

39
00:02:23,592 --> 00:02:26,925
And on the left I've used the template to keep it simple with the

40
00:02:26,925 --> 00:02:28,592
three priority items from the previous slide.

41
00:02:28,592 --> 00:02:30,878
Values of 8, 13, and 20.

42
00:02:30,878 --> 00:02:32,401
They total 41 points.

43
00:02:32,401 --> 00:02:36,592
Let's just assume my velocity of my team is 50 points.

44
00:02:36,592 --> 00:02:42,592
That would fit nicely into one iteration.

45
00:02:42,592 --> 00:02:47,013
Now the remaining three items, I just threw over into Iteration #2,

46
00:02:47,013 --> 00:02:50,697
but we notice that one is 100, one is 40,

47
00:02:50,697 --> 00:02:52,908
one is 20, so that's 160.

48
00:02:52,908 --> 00:02:56,592
That cannot fit into a normal iteration of our team.

49
00:02:56,592 --> 00:03:00,066
So either one, we increase the length of time for iteration,

50
00:03:00,066 --> 00:03:02,592
I do not like that or recommend that.

51
00:03:02,592 --> 00:03:05,342
So what I'd probably do is get the team back together.

52
00:03:05,342 --> 00:03:06,592
Maybe even use planning poker.

53
00:03:06,592 --> 00:03:11,725
Break up the one that's 100 point value into sub-user stories,

54
00:03:11,725 --> 00:03:13,592
and provide more granularity.

55
00:03:13,592 --> 00:03:17,592
Come back into this room, lay out Iteration 3,

56
00:03:17,592 --> 00:03:18,481
4, 5,

57
00:03:18,481 --> 00:03:22,925
and use these stickies on the wall to kind of place

58
00:03:22,925 --> 00:03:24,592
them into the different columns.

59
00:03:24,592 --> 00:03:27,342
And I like using stickies and I like using a whiteboard.

60
00:03:27,342 --> 00:03:28,842
I like it to be very,

61
00:03:28,842 --> 00:03:38,000
really old school and very interactive to move things around very easily. Okay, now let's look at velocity in more detail.
