Prior to talking about Agile estimating techniques,

2
00:00:03.639 --> 00:00:05.947
it's important to have a simple,

3
00:00:05.947 --> 00:00:10.947
basic understanding of the Agile philosophy and values.

4
00:00:10.947 --> 00:00:16.733
So let's spend a few moments exploring the Agile

5
00:00:16.733 --> 00:00:19.947
philosophy in the following section.

6
00:00:19.947 --> 00:00:24.947
So just what is this Agile stuff anyway?

7
00:00:24.947 --> 00:00:29.759
So we have three coworkers in a room and one says,

8
00:00:29.759 --> 00:00:31.947
let's try something called Agile.

9
00:00:31.947 --> 00:00:34.220
The other one says, great!

10
00:00:34.220 --> 00:00:36.947
So no more estimating and planning?

11
00:00:36.947 --> 00:00:40.947
The third fella, oh, help us all!

12
00:00:40.947 --> 00:00:45.368
I think some have viewed the Agile approach as the Wild West

13
00:00:45.368 --> 00:00:47.947
and everyone just does whatever they want.

14
00:00:47.947 --> 00:00:55.947
It's not like that of course, and let's learn why on the following slides.

15
00:00:55.947 --> 00:00:57.518
Agile myths.

16
00:00:57.518 --> 00:01:03.804
You may have heard, Agile has no process.

17
00:01:03.804 --> 00:01:06.947
Agile doesn't have documentation.

18
00:01:06.947 --> 00:01:10.220
Agile doesn't believe in making estimates.

19
00:01:10.220 --> 00:01:12.947
Agile doesn't follow a plan.

20
00:01:12.947 --> 00:01:17.255
All of these myths are false, of course.

21
00:01:17.255 --> 00:01:19.947
Agile does have processes, documentation,

22
00:01:19.947 --> 00:01:21.072
estimating, and plans,

23
00:01:21.072 --> 00:01:25.947
but the approach is definitely different from what you may be used to.

24
00:01:25.947 --> 00:01:31.347
And you should consider including Agile elements in your

25
00:01:31.347 --> 00:01:40.000
collection of tools for creating estimates. Now let's check out the Agile philosophy on the next slide.
