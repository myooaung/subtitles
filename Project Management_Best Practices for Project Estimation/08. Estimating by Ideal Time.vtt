00:00:01.027 --> 00:00:05.027
So now that we have learned about several estimating models,

2
00:00:05.027 --> 00:00:07.027
just what is an estimate?

3
00:00:07.027 --> 00:00:13.869
What value do we put on a unit of work or a task?

4
00:00:13.869 --> 00:00:17.027
Let's explore estimating by ideal time.

5
00:00:17.027 --> 00:00:18.715
Units of measure.

6
00:00:18.715 --> 00:00:22.090
Based on your estimate's iteration level,

7
00:00:22.090 --> 00:00:26.027
the following units of measure are recommended.

8
00:00:26.027 --> 00:00:27.627
High level, first iteration,

9
00:00:27.627 --> 00:00:32.027
you could use weeks or months as the unit of measure.

10
00:00:32.027 --> 00:00:34.652
This is your first cut, rough cut,

11
00:00:34.652 --> 00:00:38.027
and it helps give management just a high level,

12
00:00:38.027 --> 00:00:40.027
how much work is this going to take?

13
00:00:40.027 --> 00:00:43.027
They may ask you to go back again and do another iteration.

14
00:00:43.027 --> 00:00:47.027
Second iteration, I'd recommend coming back in days.

15
00:00:47.027 --> 00:00:52.027
A little more granularity and you've done a little more analysis and research.

16
00:00:52.027 --> 00:00:54.805
If management asks you again hey, go a little deeper,

17
00:00:54.805 --> 00:00:57.027
I want a little more granularity once again,

18
00:00:57.027 --> 00:00:58.694
then I'd jump to hours.

19
00:00:58.694 --> 00:01:01.027
I prefer hours almost all the time.

20
00:01:01.027 --> 00:01:04.556
If you have good models and good templates for reuse,

21
00:01:04.556 --> 00:01:07.027
hours is a good place to be.

22
00:01:07.027 --> 00:01:10.027
I like that granularity a lot.

23
00:01:10.027 --> 00:01:12.498
Typically this applies to new projects,

24
00:01:12.498 --> 00:01:17.027
but you may have a bug fix or something like that.

25
00:01:17.027 --> 00:01:23.027
And those units of work I would recommend would be in hours, probably always.

26
00:01:23.027 --> 00:01:26.527
Because that's usually a smaller amount of work,

27
00:01:26.527 --> 00:01:30.027
it's hot, it's important, it's a production fix.

28
00:01:30.027 --> 00:01:33.884
So I think it's the best granularity of quality

29
00:01:33.884 --> 00:01:36.027
estimates in the production world.

30
00:01:36.027 --> 00:01:42.659
Okay, so do you think you can estimate the length of a football game?

31
00:01:42.659 --> 00:01:45.027
Let's see if you can.

32
00:01:45.027 --> 00:01:49.027
How long is a football game?

33
00:01:49.027 --> 00:01:53.427
Can you estimate how long is a Super Bowl football game?

34
00:01:53.427 --> 00:01:55.027
Give it a shot.

35
00:01:55.027 --> 00:01:56.027
60 minutes?

36
00:01:56.027 --> 00:01:57.027
Seems reasonable.

37
00:01:57.027 --> 00:02:01.027
I've never seen a game in an hour.

38
00:02:01.027 --> 00:02:04.760
Two hours, hmm, probably not enough time.

39
00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.894
Three to four hours?

40
00:02:06.894 --> 00:02:09.027
Maybe a little closer.

41
00:02:09.027 --> 00:02:13.027
Now why would we get a multitude of estimates?

42
00:02:13.027 --> 00:02:14.694
It's because of assumptions.

43
00:02:14.694 --> 00:02:18.027
Each of us may have a different opinion.

44
00:02:18.027 --> 00:02:20.840
Ask any software engineer how long a project will

45
00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.652
take and if you ask 10 engineers, you're going to get 10 different answers.

46
00:02:25.652 --> 00:02:29.027
That's not necessarily bad, in fact it's actually good.

47
00:02:29.027 --> 00:02:35.027
If, you understand the assumptions behind what drives their estimates.

48
00:02:35.027 --> 00:02:40.027
What are some other reasons why our estimates might vary?

49
00:02:40.027 --> 00:02:40.827
Commercials?

50
00:02:40.827 --> 00:02:44.027
Lots of TV commercials.

51
00:02:44.027 --> 00:02:45.527
Half time length?

52
00:02:45.527 --> 00:02:50.027
Maybe there's a big-name star singing for that evening.

53
00:02:50.027 --> 00:02:53.527
Injuries, may cause delays as well.

54
00:02:53.527 --> 00:02:57.027
Penalties, always too many of those.

55
00:02:57.027 --> 00:02:59.300
Maybe even a weather delay.

56
00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:02.027
How about even some more commercials?

57
00:03:02.027 --> 00:03:04.380
So, any guesses out there?

58
00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:10.027
Some of you probably said 60 minutes, others three to four hours.

59
00:03:10.027 --> 00:03:15.027
Those that said 60 minutes, are right on the money.

60
00:03:15.027 --> 00:03:19.027
For the first step in making our estimate,

61
00:03:19.027 --> 00:03:24.083
is to come up with ideal time,

62
00:03:24.083 --> 00:03:32.027
because 60 minutes is the ideal time in a perfect world.

63
00:03:32.027 --> 00:03:37.027
Now let's spend a moment here to really define ideal and elapsed time.

64
00:03:37.027 --> 00:03:37.777
Ideal time,

65
00:03:37.777 --> 00:03:43.027
the amount of time that something would take to do in the perfect world,

66
00:03:43.027 --> 00:03:46.027
no distractions or other extraneous activities.

67
00:03:46.027 --> 00:03:47.950
It's important to understand that.

68
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:51.027
No assumptions, no sick time, anything like that.

69
00:03:51.027 --> 00:03:57.027
It's going to take me, heads down, eight hours to do a task.

70
00:03:57.027 --> 00:03:58.152
Now elapsed time,

71
00:03:58.152 --> 00:04:03.027
remember that's the amount of time that passes on the clock or calendar,

72
00:04:03.027 --> 00:04:09.027
in which you might perform that ideal time task.

73
00:04:09.027 --> 00:04:14.027
A comparison again as we learned, a football game is 60 minutes in ideal time,

74
00:04:14.027 --> 00:04:17.027
but about three or four hours in elapsed time.

75
00:04:17.027 --> 00:04:20.027
It's very important to understand those differences here.

76
00:04:20.027 --> 00:04:24.027
People tend to talk about the fuzzy world of elapsed time.

77
00:04:24.027 --> 00:04:35.000
You cannot run a project and build your estimates starting with elapsed time. We must always start with ideal time.
