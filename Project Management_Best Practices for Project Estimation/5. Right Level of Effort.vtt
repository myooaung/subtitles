1
00:00:00.293 --> 00:00:02.008
Right level of effort.

2
00:00:02.008 --> 00:00:06.293
How much time should you spend on developing your estimates?

3
00:00:06.293 --> 00:00:11.543
What is the right level of effort to dedicate to your estimates?

4
00:00:11.543 --> 00:00:13.293
Let's explore this further.

5
00:00:13.293 --> 00:00:18.293
Level of expertise of the people involved in the estimation process.

6
00:00:18.293 --> 00:00:21.293
What level of expertise do they have?

7
00:00:21.293 --> 00:00:24.293
In the technology, in the business area?

8
00:00:24.293 --> 00:00:29.627
Are they familiar with the business problem and with potential

9
00:00:29.627 --> 00:00:32.293
solutions and their technical implications?

10
00:00:32.293 --> 00:00:34.043
Impact of soft estimates.

11
00:00:34.043 --> 00:00:39.293
Estimates that don't have much requirements behind them or facts behind them.

12
00:00:39.293 --> 00:00:42.293
This may impact future revenues and profitability,

13
00:00:42.293 --> 00:00:45.293
if the estimates are soft, or weak.

14
00:00:45.293 --> 00:00:50.293
Amount of functional risks in the features being considered.

15
00:00:50.293 --> 00:00:54.529
A feature that is well understood is much easier to estimate than

16
00:00:54.529 --> 00:00:58.627
one that is still blurry or which will most likely require many

17
00:00:58.627 --> 00:01:00.293
iterations before getting it right.

18
00:01:00.293 --> 00:01:04.182
So you know you may need to put some more effort into that area,

19
00:01:04.182 --> 00:01:05.293
to flush that out.

20
00:01:05.293 --> 00:01:07.168
If there's a great functional risk.

21
00:01:07.168 --> 00:01:10.293
If there is no functional risk or very low risk,

22
00:01:10.293 --> 00:01:11.705
even though it's fuzzy,

23
00:01:11.705 --> 00:01:16.293
you may not need to spend the time to drill into that estimate.

24
00:01:16.293 --> 00:01:21.293
Amount of technical risk in the features being considered.

25
00:01:21.293 --> 00:01:24.106
If the technical aspects of a solution are unknown,

26
00:01:24.106 --> 00:01:26.293
the less accurate the estimates can be.

27
00:01:26.293 --> 00:01:32.293
So again, it's iterative over time, repeat, repeat, repeat.

28
00:01:32.293 --> 00:01:35.529
Here are a few more topics on the right level of

29
00:01:35.529 --> 00:01:37.293
effort to apply to your activities.

30
00:01:37.293 --> 00:01:44.293
Organization's ability to mitigate risks or manage or handle risks.

31
00:01:44.293 --> 00:01:47.370
An organization that has flexibility in adding resources,

32
00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:48.140
removing scope,

33
00:01:48.140 --> 00:01:52.493
or pushing dates might require less accuracy in estimates up front

34
00:01:52.493 --> 00:01:55.293
than an organization that has little flexibility.

35
00:01:55.293 --> 00:01:58.157
So you need to look at the management team,

36
00:01:58.157 --> 00:01:59.430
the people around you,

37
00:01:59.430 --> 00:02:03.293
and how well they can adapt or mitigate risk on the level of

38
00:02:03.293 --> 00:02:05.293
effort you need to put into an estimate.

39
00:02:05.293 --> 00:02:08.793
Level of trust between stakeholders and estimators.

40
00:02:08.793 --> 00:02:12.293
Remember the stakeholders could be the CEO,

41
00:02:12.293 --> 00:02:15.112
the CFO, business leaders, IT director,

42
00:02:15.112 --> 00:02:18.293
and most importantly your customers and users.

43
00:02:18.293 --> 00:02:20.058
What level of trust is there?

44
00:02:20.058 --> 00:02:23.748
So you can make estimates with a certain amount of effort and

45
00:02:23.748 --> 00:02:28.293
still be okay to do it again and try again.

46
00:02:28.293 --> 00:02:32.293
This trust allows stakeholders to be more accommodating

47
00:02:32.293 --> 00:02:35.293
and make trade-offs in your process.

48
00:02:35.293 --> 00:02:36.767
Trust encourages bolder estimates.

49
00:02:36.767 --> 00:02:40.083
So, much time can be wasted, in other words,

50
00:02:40.083 --> 00:02:44.793
you could spend a lot of level of effort if you're not sure

51
00:02:44.793 --> 00:02:47.293
the receiver of your estimate trusts you.

52
00:02:47.293 --> 00:02:52.293
And you may be wasting time drilling into things that aren't that important.

53
00:02:52.293 --> 00:02:56.293
The greater the trust, the better and smoother the process works for estimation.

54
00:02:56.293 --> 00:03:02.293
Very key to remember, work on the trust factor of your customers and management.

55
00:03:02.293 --> 00:03:05.893
And you can do that by having a great process and tools,

56
00:03:05.893 --> 00:03:08.293
which we'll talk about in the next module.

57
00:03:08.293 --> 00:03:08.748
Conversely,

58
00:03:08.748 --> 00:03:11.475
penalizing those that create incorrect estimates

59
00:03:11.475 --> 00:03:13.293
encourages more conservative estimates,

60
00:03:13.293 --> 00:03:19.293
which usually means padding or I don't care much about this process.

61
00:03:19.293 --> 00:03:23.293
We're going to talk about that in the next module as well.

62
00:03:23.293 --> 00:03:25.481
Going from good to great.

63
00:03:25.481 --> 00:03:29.856
The phrase going from good to great exemplifies that by

64
00:03:29.856 --> 00:03:32.820
moving to a solid process you will, I believe,

65
00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.293
make a quantum leap forward in not only creating better estimates,

66
00:03:36.293 --> 00:03:40.493
but becoming more comfortable in making them.

67
00:03:40.493 --> 00:03:42.293
It's a win/win.

68
00:03:42.293 --> 00:03:44.662
Project estimation is a process.

69
00:03:44.662 --> 00:03:51.293
Not just for you, but your entire team and maybe even your entire department.

70
00:03:51.293 --> 00:03:54.668
So, your goal, as a project management and estimator,

71
00:03:54.668 --> 00:03:59.008
is to have a process for estimation that you can repeat,

72
00:03:59.008 --> 00:04:04.293
you want to be able to repeat your estimation process for each

73
00:04:04.293 --> 00:04:08.293
assignment or task you are given to estimate.

74
00:04:08.293 --> 00:04:10.960
You want to be able to predict.

75
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:14.770
With the right process and tools you'll be able to

76
00:04:14.770 --> 00:04:16.293
better predict your estimates.

77
00:04:16.293 --> 00:04:26.000
And lastly, improve. You can only improve your process if it is documented and can be measured.
