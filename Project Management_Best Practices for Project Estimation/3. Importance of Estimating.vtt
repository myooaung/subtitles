00:00:00.908 --> 00:00:04.641
Okay, I know we all have those fears.

2
00:00:04.641 --> 00:00:07.908
Nonetheless, estimating our work is critically important.

3
00:00:07.908 --> 00:00:10.908
And here are some reasons why.

4
00:00:10.908 --> 00:00:14.908
Enables quality decisions for go/no go.

5
00:00:14.908 --> 00:00:17.908
Should we even be doing this project?

6
00:00:17.908 --> 00:00:20.908
Is there a return on investment, an ROI?

7
00:00:20.908 --> 00:00:26.108
If I spend one hundred thousand dollars, are we going to increase revenue?

8
00:00:26.108 --> 00:00:26.908
Decrease costs?

9
00:00:26.908 --> 00:00:28.544
Improve customer satisfaction?

10
00:00:28.544 --> 00:00:32.908
If not, it may be a no go.

11
00:00:32.908 --> 00:00:36.908
Enhances the setting and managing of customer expectations.

12
00:00:36.908 --> 00:00:40.508
Quality estimates enable you to better manage your customer's

13
00:00:40.508 --> 00:00:46.908
expectations so the customer knows what cost to expect.

14
00:00:46.908 --> 00:00:49.908
Provides a foundation for accurate project costs.

15
00:00:49.908 --> 00:00:54.241
A solid process for creating quality estimates provides the core

16
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:56.908
foundations for more accurate project costs.

17
00:00:56.908 --> 00:01:03.908
So as you proceed you can better compare actuals with estimates.

18
00:01:03.908 --> 00:01:05.908
Drives high-level project scoping.

19
00:01:05.908 --> 00:01:11.041
Provides the basis for guiding the prioritization of features to implement,

20
00:01:11.041 --> 00:01:12.908
which is project scoping.

21
00:01:12.908 --> 00:01:15.908
Features such as invoicing, reporting, and ecommerce.

22
00:01:15.908 --> 00:01:18.062
These are not detailed at this time,

23
00:01:18.062 --> 00:01:22.241
but high-level features with early estimates to help you

24
00:01:22.241 --> 00:01:26.908
prioritize what features to implement first.

25
00:01:26.908 --> 00:01:32.908
Here are a few more important outcomes of a quality estimation process.

26
00:01:32.908 --> 00:01:36.908
Improves quality of prioritization, but does it a little different this time.

27
00:01:36.908 --> 00:01:40.241
Now that you know what things really take to do,

28
00:01:40.241 --> 00:01:42.908
you can better prioritize and down-select your tasks.

29
00:01:42.908 --> 00:01:46.908
Influences which features will be part of the next release.

30
00:01:46.908 --> 00:01:52.276
So, we did high-level prioritization in the previous slide and in this case,

31
00:01:52.276 --> 00:01:56.908
now that we get more detailed, we can do further prioritization.

32
00:01:56.908 --> 00:01:59.970
Focuses developers on planned and estimated tasks.

33
00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:03.908
Estimates are driven at a lower level by tasks.

34
00:02:03.908 --> 00:02:07.765
Tasks get assigned, developers only work on assigned tasks.

35
00:02:07.765 --> 00:02:09.051
This is very,

36
00:02:09.051 --> 00:02:13.408
very important in focusing work and ensuring that you can

37
00:02:13.408 --> 00:02:16.908
actually meet the estimates that you laid out.

38
00:02:16.908 --> 00:02:20.408
Essential to manage and staff resources.

39
00:02:20.408 --> 00:02:24.336
In order to effectively manage budgets, staff,

40
00:02:24.336 --> 00:02:27.765
and the allocation of resources for a project,

41
00:02:27.765 --> 00:02:29.908
you need a quality estimate.

42
00:02:29.908 --> 00:02:32.574
Should you hire people when you really don't need them

43
00:02:32.574 --> 00:02:33.908
because you padded your estimate?

44
00:02:33.908 --> 00:02:36.908
No, you don't want to do that certainly.

45
00:02:36.908 --> 00:02:39.685
Foundation for realistic project schedule.

46
00:02:39.685 --> 00:02:41.908
All customers want schedules.

47
00:02:41.908 --> 00:02:45.908
So without solid estimates to lay out the schedule,

48
00:02:45.908 --> 00:02:51.908
you'll be unable to meet any sort of schedule requirements for your customer.

49
00:02:51.908 --> 00:02:55.908
The project triangle dilemma is composed of the following three elements.

50
00:02:55.908 --> 00:02:57.308
First, scope.

51
00:02:57.308 --> 00:03:02.908
What the customers want the system to do.

52
00:03:02.908 --> 00:03:04.308
Second, schedule.

53
00:03:04.308 --> 00:03:09.908
When will your customers need their new system?

54
00:03:09.908 --> 00:03:11.319
Third, cost estimate.

55
00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:13.672
That's where you come in.

56
00:03:13.672 --> 00:03:15.555
What can they afford?

57
00:03:15.555 --> 00:03:17.908
Or are willing to spend?

58
00:03:17.908 --> 00:03:23.908
The three of these are the project triangle dilemma.

59
00:03:23.908 --> 00:03:27.908
So as project managers we are striving for user satisfaction.

60
00:03:27.908 --> 00:03:32.143
User satisfaction is when the system meets the requirements,

61
00:03:32.143 --> 00:03:35.908
the scope, at a reasonable cost, the estimate,

62
00:03:35.908 --> 00:03:39.908
and is delivered when needed, schedule.

63
00:03:39.908 --> 00:03:45.908
And lastly, in the middle, it's a quality product.

64
00:03:45.908 --> 00:03:51.408
So all of that together is user or customer satisfaction and

65
00:03:51.408 --> 00:03:59.271
your estimation skills is a very important key component to

66
00:03:59.271 --> 00:04:02.908
satisfying your customer's needs.

67
00:04:02.908 --> 00:04:06.908
So what is it that you need to make a good estimate?

68
00:04:06.908 --> 00:04:09.908
You need a definition of work.

69
00:04:09.908 --> 00:04:12.908
Your requirements or project definition document.

70
00:04:12.908 --> 00:04:14.908
And in the following slide we'll go more into detail of just

71
00:04:14.908 --> 00:04:15.908
what a project definition document is.

72
00:04:15.908 --> 00:04:19.544
You also need management support.

73
00:04:19.544 --> 00:04:23.908
Is your management supportive of you?

74
00:04:23.908 --> 00:04:27.908
Educate your management on the return and investment for spending

75
00:04:27.908 --> 00:04:29.908
adequate time developing quality estimates.

76
00:04:29.908 --> 00:04:32.908
And don't be shy about it.

77
00:04:32.908 --> 00:04:36.408
Knowledge of available resources for the project.

78
00:04:36.408 --> 00:04:39.908
What resources may be at your disposal?

79
00:04:39.908 --> 00:04:43.845
Such as developers, consultants, subject matter experts for example,

80
00:04:43.845 --> 00:04:46.908
that will help you build your estimate.

81
00:04:46.908 --> 00:04:49.908
Remember, you don't know it all.

82
00:04:49.908 --> 00:04:55.908
Time to build an adequate and accurate estimate.

83
00:04:55.908 --> 00:05:01.908
Allocate enough time, proportional to the size of the project effort.

84
00:05:01.908 --> 00:05:03.708
An estimation process.

85
00:05:03.708 --> 00:05:06.708
In fact, your estimating process.

86
00:05:06.708 --> 00:05:12.908
With a solid process of your own you will succeed at

87
00:05:12.908 --> 00:05:23.000
creating and improving your estimation skills. And that is just what we'll be doing in the next modules.
