1
00:00:01,085 --> 00:00:05,085
Here is a starter process to help you get going right away.

2
00:00:05,085 --> 00:00:07,438
Someone's going to come up to you and say hey,

3
00:00:07,438 --> 00:00:10,585
can you give me an estimate for... And what you're going to do

4
00:00:10,585 --> 00:00:13,502
is you're going to pull out your Project Definition Document and

5
00:00:13,502 --> 00:00:18,085
you'll start filling it all out, gathering all the appropriate requirements.

6
00:00:18,085 --> 00:00:21,085
You'll get back with that person or steering committee

7
00:00:21,085 --> 00:00:25,835
that asked you for the estimate, and then next step will be a go or no go.

8
00:00:25,835 --> 00:00:27,835
You'll provide that information, they'll either say great,

9
00:00:27,835 --> 00:00:32,085
start or they'll say hey, I need a little more information from you.

10
00:00:32,085 --> 00:00:36,285
So the next step we're going to use our pre-launch models to

11
00:00:36,285 --> 00:00:39,085
refine the estimate and also update the PDD.

12
00:00:39,085 --> 00:00:43,085
And in this module we're going to talk about those pre-launch models.

13
00:00:43,085 --> 00:00:47,614
After you do those pre-launch models, one or more of them,

14
00:00:47,614 --> 00:00:50,085
to improve your Project Definition Document,

15
00:00:50,085 --> 00:00:55,085
and to refine your estimates, there'll be another point of go or no go.

16
00:00:55,085 --> 00:00:57,485
At this point you're either going to launch the

17
00:00:57,485 --> 00:00:59,085
project or not launch the project.

18
00:00:59,085 --> 00:01:03,085
They may even ask you to refine your estimates further.

19
00:01:03,085 --> 00:01:06,085
Let's assume they go ahead and say go with the project.

20
00:01:06,085 --> 00:01:08,942
Then we're going to start tracking actuals versus our estimates,

21
00:01:08,942 --> 00:01:10,085
see how we're doing.

22
00:01:10,085 --> 00:01:15,085
We're going to adjust our estimates with actual data.

23
00:01:15,085 --> 00:01:18,685
We're going to maybe reprioritize and refine our estimates,

24
00:01:18,685 --> 00:01:21,085
even while the project is going.

25
00:01:21,085 --> 00:01:28,085
That's a key element we're going to talk about in this module.

26
00:01:28,085 --> 00:01:36,085
Now, let's talk about how easy it is to design and build your PDD template.

27
00:01:36,085 --> 00:01:40,252
What we want to do is just create an MS/Word document with a title page,

28
00:01:40,252 --> 00:01:42,952
table of contents, headings like head 1,

29
00:01:42,952 --> 00:01:48,085
head 2, head 3, to contain your PDD template for reuse.

30
00:01:48,085 --> 00:01:51,085
Now if you want to use other tools that's great,

31
00:01:51,085 --> 00:01:54,085
but something as simple as MS/Word will work just fine.

32
00:01:54,085 --> 00:01:58,085
We want to use all the categories as a starter point from Module 1.

33
00:01:58,085 --> 00:02:01,818
Recall, these were the categories we talked about.

34
00:02:01,818 --> 00:02:05,085
Purpose, goals and objectives, success criteria, etc.

35
00:02:05,085 --> 00:02:09,085
And in Module 1 we gave you an example of what each one of these would be like.

36
00:02:09,085 --> 00:02:11,185
This would be your starting point.

37
00:02:11,185 --> 00:02:15,035
As you do each project you're going to add more sub-bullets,

38
00:02:15,035 --> 00:02:19,002
if you will, or subheadings under each one of these.

39
00:02:19,002 --> 00:02:21,085
Maybe you'll add new headings.

40
00:02:21,085 --> 00:02:27,085
And so with each iteration, for each project, you'll do a better and better job.

41
00:02:27,085 --> 00:02:41,000
So you'll want to use always the last template for your next project, okay. And as I said, always add, enhance, and improve the list with each new project.
