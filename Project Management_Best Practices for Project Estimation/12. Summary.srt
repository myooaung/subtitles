00:00:00,430 --> 00:00:04,430
Our final section of this module is an overview summary.

2
00:00:04,430 --> 00:00:09,430
As you have seen, the Agile approach may seem more streamlined or lightweight,

3
00:00:09,430 --> 00:00:14,380
compared to some of the techniques in Module 2 and 3.

4
00:00:14,380 --> 00:00:18,430
Let's review the key points on the next slide.

5
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:19,986
Module summary.

6
00:00:19,986 --> 00:00:25,430
Useful capabilities versus a series of tasks.

7
00:00:25,430 --> 00:00:29,220
Agile planning is at a higher, more abstract level.

8
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,430
So think in terms of business functions or user stories.

9
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,297
Customer involvement is key.

10
00:00:35,297 --> 00:00:40,430
Remember customers may not be that comfortable with the Agile process.

11
00:00:40,430 --> 00:00:44,430
They may want to know how much and when for the entire project.

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,430
So educate and build trust with your customer.

13
00:00:48,430 --> 00:00:51,254
Use ideal time as a unit of measure.

14
00:00:51,254 --> 00:00:54,430
Ideal time can still apply in the Agile world.

15
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:59,430
So what you've learned in the previous modules may apply here as well.

16
00:00:59,430 --> 00:01:03,136
Since Agile planning is more high level and abstract,

17
00:01:03,136 --> 00:01:07,666
you might consider ideal days and ideal hours to make it

18
00:01:07,666 --> 00:01:11,372
easier or more comfortable if you're not sure or

19
00:01:11,372 --> 00:01:13,430
comfortable with the abstract approach.

20
00:01:13,430 --> 00:01:15,764
Use relative estimation scales.

21
00:01:15,764 --> 00:01:20,430
We discussed two relative scales, Fibonacci and exponential.

22
00:01:20,430 --> 00:01:27,430
Choose a scale, educate the team on their relative values, and use it.

23
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:30,430
Planning poker is quick and easy.

24
00:01:30,430 --> 00:01:32,930
Planning poker combines expert opinions,

25
00:01:32,930 --> 00:01:33,430
analogies,

26
00:01:33,430 --> 00:01:41,430
or comparisons and decomposed user stories to drive story point values.

27
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:45,123
Agile estimation focuses on user stories,

28
00:01:45,123 --> 00:01:49,430
and is team oriented and customer centric.

29
00:01:49,430 --> 00:01:52,430
Prioritize user stories, with your customers.

30
00:01:52,430 --> 00:01:55,430
This involves the customer, of course.

31
00:01:55,430 --> 00:02:00,830
They can see the relative value of effort to get the job

32
00:02:00,830 --> 00:02:04,430
done and feel part of the planning process.

33
00:02:04,430 --> 00:02:08,430
Collect prioritized user stories into iterations.

34
00:02:08,430 --> 00:02:15,430
A key part of any work is to deliver, based on the priorities of the customer.

35
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:18,288
Perform re-estimation with each iteration.

36
00:02:18,288 --> 00:02:23,430
With each iteration you have captured the team's velocity,

37
00:02:23,430 --> 00:02:26,347
capacity, for that collection of story points.

38
00:02:26,347 --> 00:02:31,158
Your team is more experienced and now you can re-estimate

39
00:02:31,158 --> 00:02:34,430
the next iteration with more granularity.

40
00:02:34,430 --> 00:02:37,588
Lastly, thank you very much for listening to my course.

41
00:02:37,588 --> 00:02:40,430
Don't forget to check out another course of mine

42
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:48,000
that ties right into this course, Best Practices for Requirements Gathering. Thank you.
