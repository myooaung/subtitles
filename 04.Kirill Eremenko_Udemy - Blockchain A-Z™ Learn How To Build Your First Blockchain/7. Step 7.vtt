00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:10.560
Hello and welcome to this new tutorial the final tutorial of this implementation just before the demo

2
00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.910
in the next to toile.

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.180
So in this final one we're going to implement the cell at coin's function because indeed we offer the

4
00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:22.440
buyback option to our investors so that we can buy some coins back.

5
00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:25.120
And therefore investors can get their money back.

6
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:31.440
OK so to make this final function which will be another future action in my wallet.

7
00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:38.370
Well we will do this the most efficient way because indeed it will look like this function will have

8
00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:43.300
a few things to change not only variable names but you'll see it's going to be pretty similar.

9
00:00:43.530 --> 00:00:47.590
So I'm copying this just this way.

10
00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:49.960
Copy and right here.

11
00:00:50.140 --> 00:00:57.390
I'm pasting this priest function we might right a red flag here because we have the same function by

12
00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:04.540
at coin's but this one is going to be called of course cell at coin's cell at conc.

13
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:09.550
So let's go through each line one by one and see what we need to change.

14
00:01:09.550 --> 00:01:10.850
So first line here.

15
00:01:10.960 --> 00:01:16.260
Well it takes of course the address of the investor investor is the name of the variable address is

16
00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:19.950
the type of the variable and it's taking another argument.

17
00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:25.450
However it's not going to take the US invested because this time we don't have to invest any dollars

18
00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.090
to buy some at coins because we want to sell them.

19
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:34.090
But since we're selling some at coins Well we need to specify how many at coins who want to sell and

20
00:01:34.090 --> 00:01:35.530
therefore very simply.

21
00:01:35.530 --> 00:01:43.750
The second argument here will not be the U.S. invested but let's call it the coins and then for example

22
00:01:43.930 --> 00:01:50.800
sold you know or at Conte's to sell as you want but that's basically the number of coins the investor

23
00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:51.740
wants to sell.

24
00:01:52.150 --> 00:01:57.130
And that's an unsigned integer again because of course we're not playing with Atkinsons.

25
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:04.940
So at consoled There we go we have our two arguments still external we're outside of the contract.

26
00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:08.980
So all good for this first line now second line.

27
00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:17.420
So the second line is remember using our modifier which will check if the investor can buy some actions.

28
00:02:17.500 --> 00:02:23.020
So here of course it's totally irrelevant because we don't need to check that we can buy some coins.

29
00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:24.630
If we were selling at coins.

30
00:02:24.730 --> 00:02:31.750
So I'm just removing this and I'm putting the bracket right here in the previous line to start the function

31
00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:35.500
and here that's where we start defining the function.

32
00:02:35.500 --> 00:02:38.180
All right so now this line what do we have to do.

33
00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:45.190
Well first of all we will need to do exactly the same and that's why I copied this code section here.

34
00:02:45.220 --> 00:02:50.830
We will need to do exactly the same in the cell at coin's function that is to update these three variables.

35
00:02:50.830 --> 00:02:56.430
That is the equity in at coin's of the investor the equity in you is the investor and the total evidence.

36
00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:02.770
But so what we're going to do is start with the first one how do we update the equity in at Cowen's

37
00:03:02.770 --> 00:03:06.380
of the investor right after he just sold some of his had coins.

38
00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:07.990
Well this time it's really simple.

39
00:03:07.990 --> 00:03:14.080
We don't even need to do an operation first because to update basically the number of actions of the

40
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:17.090
investor in his wallet in his equity.

41
00:03:17.290 --> 00:03:20.670
Well we just need to decrement it.

42
00:03:20.740 --> 00:03:25.290
So here is not a plus equal or minus equal by not at coins.

43
00:03:25.300 --> 00:03:26.160
But of course.

44
00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:30.240
But the at consult right here and consult.

45
00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:31.090
OK.

46
00:03:31.240 --> 00:03:38.320
We just decremental it by at consultive that we get the new updated value of the equity in at coin's

47
00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:42.080
of the investor and therefore we don't need this anymore.

48
00:03:42.220 --> 00:03:43.450
So I'm removing this.

49
00:03:43.510 --> 00:03:46.940
And there we go first viable successfully updated.

50
00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:49.290
Now let's move on to the second Vargo.

51
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.810
How do we update the equity in USD and investor.

52
00:03:52.990 --> 00:03:59.170
Well please say before me what I want to say is of course my classic good news because indeed we don't

53
00:03:59.170 --> 00:04:00.750
have to update anything here.

54
00:04:00.790 --> 00:04:08.320
The equity in U.S. can simply be obtained by dividing the equity in at coin's by 1000 and that's already

55
00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:09.330
what we do here.

56
00:04:09.370 --> 00:04:16.930
Therefore job done for the second variable and now the third variable total at Cone's but is incremental

57
00:04:16.940 --> 00:04:18.260
here by the Adkins.

58
00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:21.970
But so first of all the actions but don't exist anymore.

59
00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:25.050
So removing this and so now what do we have to do.

60
00:04:25.090 --> 00:04:31.630
What do we have to do to update the total number of actions but by all the investors including this

61
00:04:31.630 --> 00:04:33.090
one we're dealing with right now.

62
00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:38.320
Well very simply right after he sold or she sold his or her actions.

63
00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:44.550
Well we will need to decrement the total number of actions but by all the investors by.

64
00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:45.890
Why is it going to be.

65
00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:48.730
Well very simply Of course the at consult.

66
00:04:48.780 --> 00:04:56.230
So I'm just copying this and I'm decrementing the total number of Aitken's But by all investors by the

67
00:04:56.230 --> 00:05:00.030
number of Atkins sold by this specific investor.

68
00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:00.970
OK.

69
00:05:00.990 --> 00:05:03.910
And now I'm going to say it again good news again.

70
00:05:04.030 --> 00:05:05.570
It is time for the demo.

71
00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:10.120
So we're done with our whole implementation.

72
00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:16.690
You know that's the end here of dysfunction at coins and this bracket here is the end of the contract.

73
00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:18.260
We are done with our contracts.

74
00:05:18.280 --> 00:05:24.130
You can actually practice to add any other functions you want which will give you some other actions

75
00:05:24.430 --> 00:05:25.710
in my wallet.

76
00:05:25.720 --> 00:05:31.870
So for example if you know some crypto trading platforms you can just look at them and see what you're

77
00:05:31.870 --> 00:05:38.140
able to do in these platforms to implement here some other functions and therefore actions Anchorage

78
00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:39.220
you to practice this.

79
00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.490
But we have the essential tools here for me to show you how we can now interact with the smart contract

80
00:05:45.890 --> 00:05:48.050
will be in my wallet and get cash.

81
00:05:48.260 --> 00:05:52.350
And mostly we have the essential tools to run a successful CEO.
