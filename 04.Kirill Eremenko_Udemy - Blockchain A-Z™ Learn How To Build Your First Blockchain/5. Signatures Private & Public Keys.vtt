00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.070
Hello and welcome back to the course on blotching.

2
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:14.070
And today we're moving onto a new topic we're talking about signature's private and public keys.

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:20.460
It's very interesting watching how just as you think you've gotten your head around something something

4
00:00:20.460 --> 00:00:21.150
else pops up.

5
00:00:21.150 --> 00:00:27.590
So we've already covered off transactions UTX those fees and the balance with how the world works.

6
00:00:27.660 --> 00:00:30.110
And now we're still in the space of transactions.

7
00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:34.840
But we've got a new angle at which we need to approach it and let's do it.

8
00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.100
Let's get straight into it.

9
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:39.110
All right so this is where we left off previously.

10
00:00:39.270 --> 00:00:45.990
We understood what you are and how the balance in quotation marks is calculated even though it actually

11
00:00:45.990 --> 00:00:54.330
doesn't exist and that's all nice and well but what's this diagram with this illustration asks for is

12
00:00:54.330 --> 00:00:56.610
a question and the question is of privacy.

13
00:00:56.610 --> 00:01:01.560
First of all by looking at this blog chain and all the transactions I can clearly see who is sending

14
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:08.820
him money like i send me money here I love send me money here and here and I can see where I'm spending

15
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.250
it.

16
00:01:09.300 --> 00:01:14.580
I'm going to bike shop get you a fruit shop and more importantly.

17
00:01:14.580 --> 00:01:15.960
So there's no privacy in that sense.

18
00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:23.190
But more importantly anybody can come in and for the next blog submit a transaction where it says Adlon

19
00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:24.800
sends Sahra money.

20
00:01:24.810 --> 00:01:29.850
Even though Adlon and Sarah might not have no idea about it they can just put a transaction in like

21
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.430
that they can calculate do you check.

22
00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:37.030
So it is you know so for instance cancel the whole block and calculate what loves you take so.

23
00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:45.090
And just put it in there and say LUNs send Sarah x amount or Adlon says that tacker X amount which would

24
00:01:45.090 --> 00:01:46.170
make more sense.

25
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:50.760
And so the question is like what well first of all when would that be possible.

26
00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:52.450
Yes of course would be possible.

27
00:01:52.770 --> 00:01:57.560
So what that person would do is they would submit that transaction make sure they put it like this.

28
00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:03.470
They just have to calculate that the Adlon has a right at utech So to put it in there and then broadcast

29
00:02:03.470 --> 00:02:09.630
and put in their temple the temple would accepted because it would calculate that you know the correct

30
00:02:09.660 --> 00:02:14.390
UTX exists and then that would be broadcast to all the other members of the miners were accepted.

31
00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.510
We were put into a blog and that one would lose the money.

32
00:02:18.510 --> 00:02:22.470
So the question is how can we add privacy to this system.

33
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.090
How does one change ensure privacy.

34
00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:28.050
So things like that don't happen and so we don't see what's going on.

35
00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:35.680
Well that happens from that happens through private and public keys as look.

36
00:02:35.710 --> 00:02:43.210
So when you create when you start to cryptocurrency you are assigned a private key and that is like

37
00:02:43.230 --> 00:02:50.620
you or your unique identifier that is like something that you never tell to anybody.

38
00:02:50.620 --> 00:02:55.410
That is just your that is like your password to your bank account.

39
00:02:55.690 --> 00:03:01.450
Then from the private key you can generate a public key and a public key is something you can actually

40
00:03:01.450 --> 00:03:02.410
share with others.

41
00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:07.510
That's how they will send you money and that's how you will send them money while you need your private

42
00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:10.400
guessable just You'll need your production to send the money.

43
00:03:10.540 --> 00:03:14.070
So a public key is what you need to show others for them to send you money.

44
00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:18.970
That's like the bank account the number of your bank account for now this let's just roll that analogy

45
00:03:18.970 --> 00:03:19.710
for now.

46
00:03:19.780 --> 00:03:21.800
You'll see that it's a bit more involved in that.

47
00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:28.420
So then let's say you want to send a message by message we can mean anything like just text or in the

48
00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:29.740
case of cryptocurrency.

49
00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:31.690
It is the transaction.

50
00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.610
So my message just let's understand transaction.

51
00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:43.480
So you've come up with a transaction let's say sorry sounds cure old 0.7 BTC.

52
00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.850
So there is a private key you've come up with this transaction instead of putting a strange up.

53
00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:53.590
How can you use the private and public key to make it secure and private.

54
00:03:53.830 --> 00:04:00.620
Well the private key is combined with the message and together they generate a signature.

55
00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:08.230
So basically the private key is used to sign the message and only you know the private key.

56
00:04:08.230 --> 00:04:14.350
So this is the key component that only you know the private key and therefore only you your signature

57
00:04:14.350 --> 00:04:15.840
will be unique to you.

58
00:04:16.100 --> 00:04:21.520
And so this message will go always with the signature.

59
00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:24.720
So this transaction will travel with the signature.

60
00:04:24.890 --> 00:04:31.030
And therefore anybody who encounters this message will also carry the signature although it encourages

61
00:04:31.060 --> 00:04:32.070
this transaction.

62
00:04:32.060 --> 00:04:34.280
Also in Canada the signature attached to it.

63
00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:42.040
The only question we have left now is how can they verify that indeed it was you who signed the signature

64
00:04:42.070 --> 00:04:43.470
who made the signature.

65
00:04:43.660 --> 00:04:46.300
Well that's where the public key comes in.

66
00:04:46.510 --> 00:04:52.990
BLOCK chains there is a verification function in the algorithm where anybody can who has the message

67
00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:56.330
and the signature and your public key which you made public.

68
00:04:56.340 --> 00:04:59.850
It's something you have to keep secret only the private keeps secret.

69
00:05:00.070 --> 00:05:03.930
Well if they have all three components they can put them into the verification function.

70
00:05:04.210 --> 00:05:06.680
And it will spit out a yes or no.

71
00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:15.950
So basically what it does is it uses the public key to assess assess the signature and which is attached

72
00:05:15.950 --> 00:05:24.590
the message to basically says combination signature message to confirm or deny or decline that this

73
00:05:24.590 --> 00:05:26.720
message was signed by this protocol.

74
00:05:26.870 --> 00:05:32.570
So basically the way to look at it is that even though from the public you cannot reverse engineer the

75
00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:41.610
private key like move everything what we are doing here because it uses the shot 256 it doesn't use

76
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:44.760
the shots of orifices x files when you use an elliptic function.

77
00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:52.400
It's a different function but basically just like with the shutter on 56 very similar situation that

78
00:05:52.490 --> 00:05:57.750
from the pro-private key you can always deterministically generate the public key but you cannot reverse

79
00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.640
engineer the product.

80
00:05:58.650 --> 00:06:00.430
So that's why you are free to share it.

81
00:06:00.690 --> 00:06:07.020
But the public key is used is used and that this function is designed in such a way that through the

82
00:06:07.020 --> 00:06:14.320
public key you are able to perform this verification you're able to say if this message indeed is this

83
00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:21.090
signature for this message was indeed from the private key which generated the public key so big even

84
00:06:21.090 --> 00:06:23.840
though this link is not reversible.

85
00:06:24.060 --> 00:06:26.590
It does allow for this to work properly.

86
00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:33.660
And so therefore whenever you send a transaction on the block chain when you encourage action your you

87
00:06:33.660 --> 00:06:38.550
will put the transaction into the chain or it like basically you put the transactions to the temple.

88
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:43.910
But what you will be attached always is action is the signature and the public.

89
00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:48.330
And then in the end all of those components will end up on the block chain.

90
00:06:48.330 --> 00:06:54.060
So always together the message of the signature and the public will end up together so that will allow

91
00:06:54.060 --> 00:07:02.700
for the knowns of the miners for everybody to verify that indeed this transaction was in Ishy initiated

92
00:07:02.700 --> 00:07:05.300
by the person who holds the private key.

93
00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.690
And that is sufficient verification that indeed Sarah wants to send a loved one your loved ones to certain

94
00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:18.480
ceremony or whoever was to send money because you know let's say Sarah is sending Adlon money then Sarah

95
00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:23.750
has her private key she creates a transaction Saracens on one 0.1 BTC.

96
00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.210
She signs that transaction the signature tries she has a public key.

97
00:07:27.270 --> 00:07:31.500
So all of the knows that the network will use the verification function and they'll apply it to these

98
00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:38.700
components which come together and they will see that indeed this signature was created by the same

99
00:07:38.700 --> 00:07:41.730
private key which issued this public key.

100
00:07:41.730 --> 00:07:48.390
And since this public key came from Sarah it's attached the message there we go.

101
00:07:48.390 --> 00:07:52.000
That means this this transaction was carried by Sarah.

102
00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:53.360
Indeed.

103
00:07:53.540 --> 00:07:58.480
Yeah so that's why you definitely need to keep your private safe.

104
00:07:58.530 --> 00:08:03.630
So that's the start of signature's private and public keys and in the village Torrijos we will delve

105
00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:05.920
deeper into this topic.

106
00:08:05.940 --> 00:08:08.570
Hope you enjoyed today's toil and I look for it see you next time.

107
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:10.320
Until then enjoy bludgeons.
