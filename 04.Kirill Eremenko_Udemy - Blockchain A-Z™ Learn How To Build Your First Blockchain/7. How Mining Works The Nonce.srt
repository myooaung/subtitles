00:00:05,750 --> 00:00:07,820
Hello and welcome back to the course on blotching.

2
00:00:07,940 --> 00:00:10,110
And today we're going to be talking about mining.

3
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,960
It's going to be a two part tutorial.

4
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,400
All right so let's have a look where we are on our map.

5
00:00:15,410 --> 00:00:18,850
We've talked about hash cryptography the immutable ledger.

6
00:00:18,860 --> 00:00:22,460
We've now also checked off distributed peer to peer networks.

7
00:00:22,490 --> 00:00:29,110
And finally we're moving on to the mining in these two tutorials we're going to find out exactly what's

8
00:00:29,330 --> 00:00:32,470
the whole system is about why is there mining.

9
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:36,600
What's the competition that everybody's participating in.

10
00:00:36,650 --> 00:00:44,240
Why is so why are so many resources allocated or dedicated to mining block chain bitcoins and things

11
00:00:44,240 --> 00:00:47,360
like that so let's have a look.

12
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,800
Here is our block in a block chain.

13
00:00:49,940 --> 00:00:54,550
And as we discussed it's got a couple of fields so it's got the block number at the top.

14
00:00:54,580 --> 00:00:55,910
It's got some data.

15
00:00:56,060 --> 00:01:02,240
And as you can see here I put in some fake data where I said sent I'd love 500 odd coins.

16
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:07,940
Then I bought something on ebay for a hundred odd coins at once and some person named Joe 70 odd coins

17
00:01:08,570 --> 00:01:15,970
and what I'd coin is is a cryptocurrency that you'll be creating together for on line in module two

18
00:01:15,970 --> 00:01:21,650
of this course is a short preview of the exciting stuff that's coming up ahead.

19
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:27,620
And something I wanted to point out here is that notice how I put not just one transaction into this

20
00:01:27,620 --> 00:01:33,890
block but several We'll discuss this in more detail in module 2 but it's already a good idea to keep

21
00:01:33,890 --> 00:01:40,370
in mind that a blog doesn't just store one single transaction or block stores multiple transactions

22
00:01:40,370 --> 00:01:43,500
so several transactions get put into a blog.

23
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:46,900
And then with watching moves onto the next one.

24
00:01:47,270 --> 00:01:51,900
So just something to keep in mind and we'll discuss this in more detail later.

25
00:01:51,950 --> 00:01:57,320
Then also in the blog we've got a field for the previous hash or the hash of the previous block and

26
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,360
this is a very important feature of block chains because that's how the cryptographic link is facilitated

27
00:02:04,370 --> 00:02:04,950
between them.

28
00:02:04,970 --> 00:02:07,480
Had this feel the blocking wouldn't be blocking.

29
00:02:08,060 --> 00:02:11,430
And finally we've got a field for the hash of the current block.

30
00:02:11,620 --> 00:02:16,190
And how do we get the hash of the current block where we take the block number of the data and the previous

31
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:23,420
hash put all of that into all that together into a hashing algorithm and it spits out a hash for us.

32
00:02:23,420 --> 00:02:24,100
And there it is.

33
00:02:24,110 --> 00:02:25,490
That's our hash.

34
00:02:25,490 --> 00:02:36,530
And so here this instantly asks for a question and the question is if it's so simple to just take the

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:42,080
block number the data and the previous hash put into hashing algorithm and get a hash out like in which

36
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:47,800
takes a half a second if it's so simple then how come black What's the whole fuss about mining.

37
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:55,340
How come there's so many like hundreds of thousands of mining rigs around the world are like nodes around

38
00:02:55,340 --> 00:02:59,770
the world and lots of mining rigs and a lot of competition powers dedicate to them.

39
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:03,420
Why is this all happening and what's this competition that everybody is in.

40
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:10,820
If this is all there is to mining a block Well in reality it's not as simple as that.

41
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:16,380
There is actually another field in a block and it's time to reveal this field.

42
00:03:16,460 --> 00:03:22,990
The field is called non-SS and not stands for number used on the once.

43
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:29,200
And so this field is what mining is all about as we'll see from the story on the next one.

44
00:03:29,570 --> 00:03:33,500
Everybody is just changing this field all the time.

45
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:39,550
So to understand this let's have a look at what is it that now controls the hatch.

46
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:44,920
What is it that now dictates the hash of the block in this new updated structure that we see.

47
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:48,400
Well it's these things how it in the Green Square.

48
00:03:48,500 --> 00:03:53,780
We've got the block number the non-SS is now included in that party.

49
00:03:53,870 --> 00:03:56,180
And then we've got the data and the previous hash.

50
00:03:56,190 --> 00:04:01,010
So now we take all these four components we put them into a hashing algorithm and then it will spit

51
00:04:01,070 --> 00:04:02,960
out the hash value.

52
00:04:03,440 --> 00:04:11,150
And so all of a sudden now what the non-SS gives us it gives us extra control gives us extra flexibility.

53
00:04:11,150 --> 00:04:19,920
Now we can manipulate the hash value by changing the non-SS so we don't have to change the block and

54
00:04:19,970 --> 00:04:23,780
we can change the block number because the block number is the block where we can change the previous

55
00:04:23,780 --> 00:04:30,440
hash because it's linked directly to what we have in the previous block and we can change the data because

56
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,880
that would mean we're tampering with the data and that would defeat the purpose of a blockade.

57
00:04:36,890 --> 00:04:38,520
It has to be an immutable nature.

58
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:40,300
We want to prevent tampering.

59
00:04:40,670 --> 00:04:46,940
So now because we have the nons we are free to change the value of rods and the nonces just basically

60
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:54,140
a number we were free to change the value of insurance and that will allow us to change or to manipulate

61
00:04:54,140 --> 00:04:55,880
the Hashi to vary the hash.

62
00:04:55,880 --> 00:05:01,550
The proper word is very Because as we know they're hashing out with them we cannot predict in advance

63
00:05:01,550 --> 00:05:02,680
what it will spit out.

64
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,690
We put in a nonce and it will spit out something that we cannot control the hash.

65
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:12,060
But at least we can vary the hash by varying the not so let's have a look at how that works.

66
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:14,020
So let's put in 19.

67
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:15,270
So here let's go back for a second.

68
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,120
So nuance is like zero.

69
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:22,040
Right now it's empty and that's why we have a certain hash then we put in like a random number 19.

70
00:05:22,110 --> 00:05:30,330
We get a higher and different hash 20 different hash 21 again different hash 22 23 then we can do I

71
00:05:31,050 --> 00:05:35,100
O something I wanted to point out here so you can see that the hash is changing.

72
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:41,460
And also notice how where do we go from let's say 20 from 21 to 22.

73
00:05:41,460 --> 00:05:46,300
Notice how the hash is changing absolutely like dramatically.

74
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,780
And why is that happening.

75
00:05:47,790 --> 00:05:50,410
Or that's the avalanche effect in action.

76
00:05:50,430 --> 00:05:53,670
What's happening is in the block itself.

77
00:05:54,150 --> 00:05:56,760
Essentially we just changing one bit of information.

78
00:05:56,760 --> 00:06:03,390
So if you write it out in binary code you will see that this blog has like some combination of ones

79
00:06:03,390 --> 00:06:04,040
and zeros.

80
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:11,360
And to go from this to this we're just changing literally one bit somewhere from 0 to 1.

81
00:06:11,370 --> 00:06:14,670
And that is that's all the change we're doing.

82
00:06:14,670 --> 00:06:19,530
But at the same time the hash used is completely unrecognizable completely different to what we had

83
00:06:19,530 --> 00:06:20,300
before.

84
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:24,380
And that is important and will be important why we'll see in the next tutorial.

85
00:06:24,390 --> 00:06:28,650
But that's the avalanche effect and actually I just wanted to illustrate that.

86
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:29,310
OK.

87
00:06:29,340 --> 00:06:36,930
So that's how we change and also just take a random number this turn and 43 like there's ten thousand

88
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:37,680
nine hundred fifty five.

89
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:43,410
So non-SS is a number that can go up to like four billion something.

90
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,730
So it's quite a large number there's a lot of variety that you can play around with the nonce.

91
00:06:48,750 --> 00:06:52,240
And that gives you variability in the hash.

92
00:06:52,260 --> 00:06:55,410
So there we go that's a starts to mining.

93
00:06:55,590 --> 00:07:03,990
We'll end the first part first tutorial of this two part series here because that was like an important

94
00:07:04,260 --> 00:07:07,370
concept that might be the blocks have nots which we can control.

95
00:07:07,380 --> 00:07:12,360
We can change to vary the hash and in the next tutorial we'll put it all together and you'll see why

96
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,540
exactly that's important and what the miners are actually doing with their electricity and all their

97
00:07:19,110 --> 00:07:19,720
power.

98
00:07:20,010 --> 00:07:20,340
All right.

99
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:22,830
So intro this Tauriel and of course he likes them.

100
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,470
Until then enjoy bludgeons.
