00:00:05.560 --> 00:00:07.720
Hello and welcome back to the course on blog chain.

2
00:00:07.750 --> 00:00:09.960
And today we're talking about security.

3
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:11.220
So we've got two topics.

4
00:00:11.220 --> 00:00:14.700
If you're a virtual machine and gas let's see how they relate to security.

5
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:15.300
OK.

6
00:00:15.310 --> 00:00:17.260
So here's our system so far.

7
00:00:17.270 --> 00:00:20.920
Our set up we've got the blockade we've got the network.

8
00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:26.470
We've got the smart contracts we've got the data the transactions we've got everything like you can

9
00:00:26.470 --> 00:00:32.320
see it's the system has grown is becoming so complex and in complex systems you have security threats

10
00:00:32.410 --> 00:00:36.440
you have more and more opportunities for things to go wrong.

11
00:00:36.700 --> 00:00:46.390
And what's our so of sort of this question What are the most obvious most evident security threats that

12
00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.460
might have popped up along our discussion so far.

13
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:58.450
So we've already discussed one and one of the that one was the whole notion of loops of why bitcoin

14
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.050
because the script never included loops because somebody might maliciously or by accident include an

15
00:01:05.050 --> 00:01:11.560
infinite loop or a very heavy load that would really slow down the computations on all of these nodes

16
00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:15.580
and slow down the network and people would be happy and so and so they didn't could loose.

17
00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:19.920
But the theorem did so we still haven't discussed how they solved that problem.

18
00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:23.240
How come their loops are not a potential threat.

19
00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:29.380
And on the other hand a second problem that might have popped into your mind when we were discussing

20
00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:36.370
smart contract is these smart contracts are run on every single node on every single machine in the

21
00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:37.810
network.

22
00:01:37.810 --> 00:01:40.640
How convenient is that for a virus.

23
00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:45.730
If somebody writes a virus is a smart contract and sends it out on the block and gets copy to all the

24
00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:53.140
computers then all of a sudden it's the end like everybody is everybody's machine is infected and let

25
00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.060
alone the virus is what if people what if these smart contracts gain access to your private files.

26
00:01:59.060 --> 00:02:04.750
They're running on your machine what if they access your files that you have on your hard drive and

27
00:02:05.370 --> 00:02:08.650
any Like maybe even your webcam and things like that.

28
00:02:08.650 --> 00:02:09.850
Who needs that.

29
00:02:09.850 --> 00:02:10.840
Why.

30
00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:12.530
Where is the protection from that.

31
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:18.270
And so those are the two main security threats that we're going to read today.

32
00:02:18.460 --> 00:02:20.250
So this outline them here.

33
00:02:20.260 --> 00:02:26.980
We've got viruses and access to profiles and infinite loops or even just heavy computations.

34
00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:29.570
That's also sufficiently bad.

35
00:02:29.830 --> 00:02:32.830
So let's have a look how is this Prawle all these problems solved.

36
00:02:32.830 --> 00:02:41.080
The first problem in our list which is the viruses what's what is done about that.

37
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:49.910
Is when you participate in the network you actually get a theorem virtual machine or otherwise EDI.

38
00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:53.290
So it's the first topic here in our header.

39
00:02:53.480 --> 00:02:55.510
And what that UVM is is it.

40
00:02:55.580 --> 00:03:04.580
Say it's a virtual machine that is running on your computer and therefore it completely encapsulates

41
00:03:04.580 --> 00:03:05.590
everything that runs there.

42
00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:09.450
So this smart contract it actually runs it.

43
00:03:09.530 --> 00:03:14.020
It is on your computer but inside your computer it's kind of like having a computer inside of your computer.

44
00:03:14.090 --> 00:03:19.690
You have that virtual machine inside your computer and nothing can get out of that virtual machine.

45
00:03:19.730 --> 00:03:26.330
It's it's like the smart contract or any other program that's running on the virtual machine doesn't

46
00:03:26.420 --> 00:03:30.650
know then anything outside of that virtual machine exists.

47
00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:35.770
You're guaranteed that anything that happens on the virtual machine stays on the virtual machine.

48
00:03:35.780 --> 00:03:41.300
So if something were to go wrong it would only go wrong inside that virtual machine and you could just

49
00:03:41.300 --> 00:03:42.320
delete it off your computer.

50
00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:51.050
It would never actually spread onto your the rest of your hard drive and all everything else that you

51
00:03:51.050 --> 00:03:52.350
have on your machine.

52
00:03:52.670 --> 00:04:00.650
And at the same time also what that means is because it's in secluded because it's detached from the

53
00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:01.280
rest of your computer.

54
00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.220
That means the smart contract will never have access to your files to your profiles.

55
00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:08.690
To other things that you have on your computer.

56
00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.270
It will never ever be able to see them.

57
00:04:11.270 --> 00:04:14.380
And so there you have that confidence and security.

58
00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:18.390
That's your you're safe that your privacy safe.

59
00:04:18.590 --> 00:04:20.350
So that's how they solve that.

60
00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:23.940
Viruses and privacy issue of the theory and virtual machine.

61
00:04:24.170 --> 00:04:29.540
And now we're going to talk about the second issue of infinite loops or heavy calculations.

62
00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:30.590
How do they solve that.

63
00:04:30.590 --> 00:04:33.820
That's that's a that's a tough one to solve.

64
00:04:34.010 --> 00:04:38.630
Well what that's where the concept of gas comes in.

65
00:04:38.870 --> 00:04:41.390
It's a really cool concept in my view.

66
00:04:41.390 --> 00:04:48.930
It's an ingenious solution and the solution is for any computation that's run on the block chain.

67
00:04:49.400 --> 00:04:54.060
The developers of the smart contract need to pay all the smart contracts in today.

68
00:04:54.230 --> 00:05:02.570
So you have an ocean of gas and you use that gas to pay for any calculations that you need to run and

69
00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.510
it's like a car for a car to run for a car to move.

70
00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.540
It has to use gas.

71
00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:08.060
Same same concept here.

72
00:05:08.300 --> 00:05:13.160
And let's have a look at some examples here.

73
00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:21.740
So this is there's a list of costs or like a table of costs and this is like the official information

74
00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:22.610
from a theory.

75
00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:29.870
So here they will they specify how much gas units it costs to run an operation for example to run an

76
00:05:29.870 --> 00:05:39.560
addition operation it costs three gas three units of gas to run a multiplication operation cost five

77
00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:40.500
units of gas.

78
00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:45.380
Is more expensive to run multiplication operation because more competition is having to run a subtraction

79
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:54.230
operations three units of gas integer division 5 and you can look 3s for example bitwise AND operation

80
00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:06.600
three side less than comparison three and so on get balance of the given accounts 400 gas get size accounts

81
00:06:06.620 --> 00:06:08.900
called 700 and so on.

82
00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:15.390
So was this create a new account or associated code thirty two thousand gas.

83
00:06:15.530 --> 00:06:23.950
So you can see that every single operation cost gas and these are like these are very low level operations

84
00:06:23.950 --> 00:06:33.270
so the coal that you call it and solidity then gets converted to computer code like very low level code.

85
00:06:33.290 --> 00:06:35.840
And then these prices are applied.

86
00:06:35.960 --> 00:06:42.050
And so right away you can see how that solves the problem that if your program is too computationally

87
00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:47.230
heavy or if you have an infinite loop in it you will very quickly run out of gas and it will stop working.

88
00:06:47.230 --> 00:06:48.880
It will just that's it.

89
00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:49.360
The end.

90
00:06:49.370 --> 00:06:56.240
And that means first of all you'll run out of money so you'll be kind of penalized for writing that

91
00:06:56.270 --> 00:06:56.920
code.

92
00:06:57.140 --> 00:07:03.440
And second is that there will be no problem in the network because it will very quickly stop and the

93
00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.240
other thing but like that's the solution.

94
00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:12.120
But what I really love about this whole concept is that it incentivizes people to write good code.

95
00:07:12.290 --> 00:07:17.630
Meaning that you don't want to make your code inefficient even by a tiny bit because going to cost you

96
00:07:17.630 --> 00:07:22.970
more so you're going to want to write the most efficient code possibly going to come up with really

97
00:07:22.970 --> 00:07:26.640
smart solutions to the problems.

98
00:07:26.690 --> 00:07:32.730
And that's a great thing because if the future of the Internet is on the block chain.

99
00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:39.080
The future of the world if Web 3.0 always on the block chain then that means we're going to have a very

100
00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:40.040
efficient future.

101
00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:45.530
We're going to have very efficient programs running and that's really cool because how often do you

102
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:48.270
go on a Web site and takes like 5 seconds to load.

103
00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.860
Or like seven seconds to load.

104
00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:55.910
Or you're running a program on your computer and it's just very slow and you don't see why it's so slow

105
00:07:55.910 --> 00:07:57.370
and it's unnecessary slow.

106
00:07:57.380 --> 00:08:01.360
It's simply a lot of the time simply because people don't write efficient code.

107
00:08:01.520 --> 00:08:06.950
But when you have to pay for your code for your code to run there's a whole different story you're going

108
00:08:06.950 --> 00:08:09.290
to put in much more effort and try to be efficient.

109
00:08:09.290 --> 00:08:13.100
So I think it's a very smart solution like that.

110
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:17.820
Then I also wanted to show you that ether is a gas station down in fall.

111
00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:25.680
We hear and like I don't use this website I'm not a developer but if you are going to be developing

112
00:08:25.680 --> 00:08:28.370
things you might want to check it out.

113
00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:35.270
I think what it does is it helps you estimate how much gas you're going to be paying ants and so on.

114
00:08:35.970 --> 00:08:38.460
So yeah the point is it exists.

115
00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:46.410
They actually take care of the community and they make sure that you know you have access to information

116
00:08:46.410 --> 00:08:47.460
like that.

117
00:08:47.460 --> 00:08:54.320
And the other thing I also want to mention is that in theory you might know that they have either as

118
00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:56.010
the cryptocurrency.

119
00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.300
So why do they need gas.

120
00:08:57.300 --> 00:09:00.470
Why wouldn't they just use ether to pay for the coat.

121
00:09:00.600 --> 00:09:06.300
Well the thing is that the price for esearch fluctuates extremely like extremely all the time.

122
00:09:06.300 --> 00:09:08.470
It's like up and down daily.

123
00:09:08.610 --> 00:09:17.430
And so if these prices were in either if these prices were either then they would like in dollar terms

124
00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:24.180
running like additional operation might cost like half a cent one day and cost 10 cents the other day

125
00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:30.290
and so it would be very predictable to try to know what you're running a program is going to cost.

126
00:09:30.390 --> 00:09:32.250
But he says they priced them in gas.

127
00:09:32.310 --> 00:09:36.750
They just all they need to do is set up the conversion rate between gas and ether.

128
00:09:36.830 --> 00:09:41.280
And that way as the price of either fluctuates they can adjust the price the conversion rate between

129
00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.090
gas and either.

130
00:09:42.210 --> 00:09:48.840
And with that I think because again it's a distributed system there's no central authority the way they

131
00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:53.690
decided is as far as I know is by community consensus that conversion rate.

132
00:09:53.790 --> 00:09:56.450
So these are more or less fixed.

133
00:09:56.580 --> 00:10:02.910
And then the conversion rate between gas and either is decided by community consensus in some in some

134
00:10:02.910 --> 00:10:03.500
way.

135
00:10:03.870 --> 00:10:06.520
And so that's how the system works.

136
00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:12.420
And the other thing I wanted to say here is that this now that we know the connection between gas and

137
00:10:12.420 --> 00:10:16.610
ether we can see the difference between ether and Bitcoin.

138
00:10:16.770 --> 00:10:24.570
So the predominant idea behind bitcoin is to create a crook to currency something that people can transact

139
00:10:24.570 --> 00:10:32.790
with and exchange value and pay for services and something that's borderless and transparent and stateless

140
00:10:33.060 --> 00:10:37.000
and can there's no restrictions you don't have it's permission.

141
00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:41.300
You don't have to ask permission for people to send money wherever you like.

142
00:10:41.670 --> 00:10:44.400
And that's the core principle behind bitcoin.

143
00:10:44.670 --> 00:10:51.240
Whereas with a theory I'm with ether even though people do use it to transact people do use it to invest

144
00:10:51.330 --> 00:10:52.040
into.

145
00:10:52.290 --> 00:11:00.030
But at the same time now that we know that it is really that this whole concept of gas ether the idea

146
00:11:00.030 --> 00:11:11.160
behind it is to is not to create a cryptic currency is to create a system and network where people can

147
00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:18.960
run code on the block chain and pay for it with there to create a like to create a system where you

148
00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:23.210
can actually create applications that will run on the block chain.

149
00:11:23.490 --> 00:11:29.430
And payment for those raw running applications as we saw is absolutely necessary because otherwise people

150
00:11:29.430 --> 00:11:33.930
are going to abuse the Bush is going to they are going to write efficient code and so on and so either

151
00:11:33.930 --> 00:11:42.450
is a means to create that environment where programs can be safely run all the created and run on the

152
00:11:42.450 --> 00:11:43.120
block chain.

153
00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:47.250
And that facilitates all the promises always theory.

154
00:11:47.470 --> 00:11:51.310
That's where you're going to have all of these applications all these programs.

155
00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:57.720
All of these decentralized decentralized they are decentralized applications and so that we can move

156
00:11:57.720 --> 00:12:05.870
to a future where there are no central organizations that have the servers where everything is running

157
00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.880
so it's just a way for all of that to happen.

158
00:12:08.880 --> 00:12:14.730
It wouldn't be able to we wouldn't have been possible without either because of that whole notion of

159
00:12:14.730 --> 00:12:18.870
the Turing completeness of the like so you can see how it all ties in together in order to have Turing

160
00:12:18.870 --> 00:12:19.930
completeness.

161
00:12:20.010 --> 00:12:26.400
You have to have a cost for these operations Otherwise it's just going to be and that's why ether comes

162
00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:36.120
in and either is therefore not just a cryptocurrency it's actually the means for all of these whole

163
00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:36.670
thing to work.

164
00:12:36.670 --> 00:12:43.950
So it's it's actually much much more than a cryptocurrency that the foundations behind it there are

165
00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:49.210
much more involved than just a means to exchange value.

166
00:12:49.320 --> 00:12:53.350
It's actually to facilitate to empower this whole system.

167
00:12:53.430 --> 00:12:59.160
It's like the fuel the gas they got the gas that's running the whole system.

168
00:12:59.190 --> 00:13:04.860
Eventually if we move to this to them as the gas is going to be running this whole global computer or

169
00:13:05.040 --> 00:13:11.080
the next version of the Internet and to finish off we've got some additional reading.

170
00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.120
Interesting.

171
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:19.530
Like an interesting comparison here because the author took a took some operations and calculated their

172
00:13:19.530 --> 00:13:26.970
cost in U.S. dollars for instance to add or subtract to integers it would cost that many dollars or

173
00:13:27.030 --> 00:13:33.720
for one U.S. dollar you would get thirty seven thousand subtractions or to add to subtract integers

174
00:13:33.720 --> 00:13:36.970
one million times it costs you $26 twice as well.

175
00:13:36.990 --> 00:13:41.560
That's at the time of writing course the prices fluctuate.

176
00:13:41.790 --> 00:13:50.000
So if you're interested to learn a bit more about that then we'll will leave this in the course not.

177
00:13:50.400 --> 00:13:50.910
So there you go.

178
00:13:50.910 --> 00:13:57.390
We talked about two problems two security problems say viruses and X trode files and heavy conditions

179
00:13:57.420 --> 00:14:04.200
and infinite loops and we saw how the theory solves them with the theory of virtual machine and the

180
00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.880
whole concept of gas.

181
00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:10.960
I hope enjoyed today's tutorial and I look forward to seeing you back here next time.

182
00:14:11.010 --> 00:14:12.600
Until then bludgeons.
