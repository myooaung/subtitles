00:00:05.070 --> 00:00:07.290
Hello and welcome back to the course on blotching.

2
00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.450
And today we're going to talk about how wallets work.

3
00:00:10.660 --> 00:00:18.070
So we've already built a basic understanding of transactions and slowness hopefully is getting better

4
00:00:18.070 --> 00:00:20.180
and better with the more examples we look at.

5
00:00:20.200 --> 00:00:22.120
We slowly we start of transactions and you check.

6
00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.920
So then we added on fees and we had a look at a couple of those.

7
00:00:25.930 --> 00:00:30.250
Today we're going to bring everything together from the perspective of the wallets and it will give

8
00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:38.080
us like a 10000 foot view on what's happening and hopefully that will really drive the point home of

9
00:00:38.140 --> 00:00:43.600
how transactions work and block change and how they're different very different to what we're used to

10
00:00:43.600 --> 00:00:44.710
halfbacks.

11
00:00:44.710 --> 00:00:45.860
All right so let's have a look.

12
00:00:46.150 --> 00:00:51.730
We're going to drop our blotching here so this is like going from bottom to top.

13
00:00:51.730 --> 00:00:56.980
That's like Book 5 0 1 5 or 4 maybe there's more blocks higher up doesn't really matter and we're going

14
00:00:56.980 --> 00:01:04.050
to allocate or like see where those transactional where the actions actions are actually sitting in

15
00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:05.130
our watch chain.

16
00:01:05.140 --> 00:01:10.080
So those ones that we started with originally in our examples in the previous tutorials that say that

17
00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.850
we're sitting in block 5 0 1.

18
00:01:12.060 --> 00:01:19.270
Then when I purchased the bike in the bike shop at the first bike that went to block 502.

19
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:27.250
And also the transaction for the second was actually that also went into blowflies or two as well.

20
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:35.640
Then the more transactions that came along they were 5 0 3 and then in clockwise or 4 again I went shopping

21
00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.940
for a bicycle.

22
00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:44.400
And so one of the things to do now is we're going to look at how a wallet comes up with a value or balance

23
00:01:44.400 --> 00:01:50.220
value because from what we've discussed it's interesting that there isn't actually a balance value in

24
00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:52.600
a block a block chain is this.

25
00:01:52.620 --> 00:01:56.380
You can see there's nothing to say a balance for any person.

26
00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:59.580
Just has lists and list of transactions in every single block.

27
00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:00.570
That's all there is.

28
00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:06.690
But nevertheless when you log into your cryptocurrency wallet you see a balance which says you have

29
00:02:06.690 --> 00:02:11.230
this many bitcoins or you have this much theory or you have this much lighter weight.

30
00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:13.620
How is where does that dollars come from.

31
00:02:13.690 --> 00:02:17.830
The the wallet store the balance does it is there like a centralized system.

32
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:21.460
Well actually no the wallet actually.

33
00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:27.450
What it does is it calculates your total UTX So that's available to you and shows you that.

34
00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:28.960
And it calls it the balance.

35
00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:35.200
So let's have a look at how this happens we go into it in order for that to happen the world will need

36
00:02:35.200 --> 00:02:43.430
to go through all of these transactions the whole block chain and pull out your remaining UTX.

37
00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:49.650
So let's do that with our examples in mind what what we know about what happens.

38
00:02:49.660 --> 00:02:54.230
So in the first case when I went to spend money I went to buy a bicycle.

39
00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.770
And this is what happened.

40
00:02:56.500 --> 00:03:07.920
I took this transaction be 0.6 BTC from Helen and I split it into paying for my bike and sending a 0.1

41
00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.000
back to myself.

42
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:14.470
So these two that we see here so we're going to draw that here so we can see that this transaction actually.

43
00:03:14.470 --> 00:03:21.610
So this transaction had had an unspent output of 0.6 but that unspin output could split into two 0.5

44
00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:22.770
and 0.1.

45
00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:27.160
So what we're going to do is we're going to put a big black square at the end of this transaction to

46
00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:34.210
signify to ourselves that this transaction has been like spent the output of this election has been

47
00:03:34.210 --> 00:03:38.530
spent and that we know exactly where it went so it's going to put a black box here.

48
00:03:39.070 --> 00:03:41.080
OK so let's look at day two.

49
00:03:41.110 --> 00:03:47.560
When I went to buy the second bicycle so it was like a bicycle I took some more unspent action on which

50
00:03:47.560 --> 00:03:48.330
I had.

51
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:50.400
So we find them here.

52
00:03:50.440 --> 00:03:52.770
This was from De la.

53
00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.220
No no.

54
00:03:53.260 --> 00:03:55.370
This one from Adlon from Susan.

55
00:03:55.420 --> 00:03:58.050
And then this one over here which I got.

56
00:03:58.210 --> 00:03:59.610
And I.

57
00:03:59.650 --> 00:04:05.190
All of that's spent to buy this bicycle So let's drill that so you can see where we go from the what

58
00:04:05.230 --> 00:04:09.020
this output from the transaction with Susan when she sent me money.

59
00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.930
So that goes in there.

60
00:04:10.960 --> 00:04:12.840
This was actual love goes in there.

61
00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:16.520
And this was actually with myself this was put out because of that.

62
00:04:16.600 --> 00:04:21.760
And so again we're going to put like big black boxes at the end of these two show two for ourselves

63
00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:26.090
to show us that there are transaction outputs have been spent here.

64
00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:27.160
OK.

65
00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:33.790
And then day three when I went to buy the third bicycle and the apple which you checked so that I use

66
00:04:33.790 --> 00:04:34.340
that.

67
00:04:34.540 --> 00:04:43.880
So I used this one at lunch to me for point or for BTC the e-bay transaction point or three and I'd

68
00:04:43.890 --> 00:04:51.920
love to meet 0.3 again and all of those went into funding these purchases by actual fruit and the changes

69
00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:52.620
went to me.

70
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:58.830
And remember some some of the money went to the fees but that is reflected as we saw in the Coinbase

71
00:04:58.860 --> 00:05:03.990
transaction so that's doesn't have to be issue and be as illustrated here.

72
00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:11.830
All right so if we put that in here it will see that these three have continued on into July.

73
00:05:11.860 --> 00:05:17.260
They have acted as inputs into these transactions so technology would be better to draw the arrow going

74
00:05:17.260 --> 00:05:22.420
like this you know more logical I guess it went to the start of this transaction sort so as we could

75
00:05:22.420 --> 00:05:27.600
see previously in the Prue's trial how they like feed into each other through that tree.

76
00:05:27.890 --> 00:05:29.350
When it was a treat either.

77
00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:29.930
All right.

78
00:05:29.930 --> 00:05:31.870
And so we're going to put three black boxes here.

79
00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:35.250
That means these are also used up.

80
00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:36.500
So what does the wallet do.

81
00:05:36.640 --> 00:05:37.960
Well does that analysis.

82
00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:43.150
So because we can see how they're linked up and what then we'll do is we'll go through the bloodshed

83
00:05:43.180 --> 00:05:48.730
and I'll first identify Well I was probably already done that identify all of the transactions which

84
00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:53.710
ended up in something coming to me some output coming to me.

85
00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:58.040
So this one this one this on this one this this one this one this one this one and this one.

86
00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:01.640
And then the wallet will see out of those transactions.

87
00:06:01.660 --> 00:06:07.020
Which ones still have UTX which ones still have unspent transaction Algren's.

88
00:06:07.030 --> 00:06:09.250
This one this one and this one.

89
00:06:09.250 --> 00:06:13.520
So three to this one because the other ones we can see they have black boxes so we know that they're

90
00:06:13.520 --> 00:06:14.500
been used up.

91
00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:19.570
So only the ones involved like boxes actually have to expose as are all the world has to do now is just

92
00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:26.660
add up these amount adds up these three modes and you get a variance of 0.2 six BTC.

93
00:06:26.780 --> 00:06:29.060
And so that's what you see on your screen when you log in.

94
00:06:29.170 --> 00:06:35.370
But in reality as you can tell there is actually no where for this money is there to be stored in an

95
00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:36.290
cryptocurrency.

96
00:06:36.310 --> 00:06:38.210
There is actually no coins.

97
00:06:38.230 --> 00:06:40.540
They just don't exist as on paper.

98
00:06:40.540 --> 00:06:47.860
There's no coins there's no there's no even like the ones and zeros like numbers on an account somewhere

99
00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:48.970
like when you log into your bank.

100
00:06:48.970 --> 00:06:52.660
There's a number and that is actually how it exists in the bank.

101
00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.600
It's a number like I don't know you have 300 dollars in your bank account.

102
00:06:56.620 --> 00:06:59.230
That means in the bank there is $300.

103
00:06:59.380 --> 00:07:03.720
Like in an electronic ledger on your back out on a block chain.

104
00:07:03.790 --> 00:07:10.520
This is for our convenience it doesn't actually exist this money has a number in the block chain.

105
00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:17.370
It exists as a combination of the UTX those that you have available to you and that's all it is.

106
00:07:17.470 --> 00:07:25.580
That's how wallets work and hopefully this tutorial also helps solidify all that knowledge that we discussed

107
00:07:25.580 --> 00:07:29.950
that we developed over the past couple of tourers how transactions work is a very important topic and

108
00:07:30.310 --> 00:07:37.000
like crypto currencies are really booming right now a lot of people are like investing in two different

109
00:07:37.590 --> 00:07:38.880
crypto currencies.

110
00:07:38.910 --> 00:07:46.210
And yeah I like I I really don't think that everybody who is doing that knows how they actually work.

111
00:07:46.210 --> 00:07:51.250
So I think this is important knowledge whether or not you are investing you to use your garments are

112
00:07:51.250 --> 00:07:54.270
you building one especially if you're building one.

113
00:07:54.280 --> 00:07:58.630
It's important to know these things are important to know what you're actually dealing with that it's

114
00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:03.820
completely different to the world that we used to completely different to the world of banking.

115
00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:11.660
And yeah hopefully now it's all clear and we will proceed from here going into more interesting topics.

116
00:08:11.710 --> 00:08:13.300
Call wait to see on the next tutorial.

117
00:08:13.300 --> 00:08:15.210
And until then enjoy Blodgett's.
