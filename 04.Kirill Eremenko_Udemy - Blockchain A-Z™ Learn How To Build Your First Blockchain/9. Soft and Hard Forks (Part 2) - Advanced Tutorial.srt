00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:07,170
Hello and welcome back to the course on my watch chain.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:11,180
And today we're going to continue our discussion of soft and hard forums.

3
00:00:11,180 --> 00:00:17,660
All right so previously we left off here where we talked about the real life examples of soft and hard

4
00:00:17,660 --> 00:00:19,640
for us in the human Bitcoin chains.

5
00:00:19,820 --> 00:00:21,350
So just to quickly recap.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:29,510
We saw that on the 20th of July 2006 when there was a hard fork in the theory chain because of the attack

7
00:00:29,510 --> 00:00:34,730
on the Dow and is here and wanted to revert the transactions in that attack and those miners who agreed

8
00:00:34,730 --> 00:00:41,930
continued theory therian those models who disagreed continue proof Ilium classic in bitcoin on 20 of

9
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:47,150
July's thousand seventeen there a soft porc associated with the acceptance of segment on first of August

10
00:00:47,150 --> 00:00:48,160
2017.

11
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:58,700
There was a hard fork which was caused by some miners being unhappy with the block size limit of 1 megabytes

12
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:05,180
and they decided to increase the block size limit to 8 megabytes and therefore they split off into their

13
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:09,570
own chain which is now called Bitcoin cash Bitcoin continues here.

14
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:18,170
And then on 24th October 2002 and 17 there were some miners who were unhappy with the basic mining devices

15
00:01:18,170 --> 00:01:23,950
because they were too powerful and these miners wanted to go back to mining with G-B use.

16
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,170
And that's why there was another four and a hard four.

17
00:01:28,190 --> 00:01:34,890
And this new chain is now known as Bitcoin gold and Bitcoin continued here as well.

18
00:01:35,690 --> 00:01:39,360
So that's the real life examples of soft and hard forks.

19
00:01:39,410 --> 00:01:41,200
Now let's go to the theory.

20
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,420
What is the difference between a soft and hard for.

21
00:01:44,690 --> 00:01:47,870
And what exactly do they do to the underlying software.

22
00:01:47,870 --> 00:01:49,370
So let's have a look.

23
00:01:49,370 --> 00:01:52,010
So this is the rule of thumb that hard for.

24
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:54,490
They loosen up rules and soft forks.

25
00:01:54,480 --> 00:01:55,980
They tighten up rules.

26
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:02,660
It might sound a bit counterintuitive like you might think that it's you know soft and hard tight and

27
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:05,000
what it is what it is.

28
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:12,110
We'll discuss a little bit later why the name might be what their name is might have been chosen as

29
00:02:12,110 --> 00:02:12,650
such.

30
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,640
But in general just remember this is a rule of thumb that hard force loosen up the rules.

31
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:25,700
So of course they tighten up the rules even if the way to remember is that it is the definition is the

32
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:27,460
counterintuitive definition.

33
00:02:27,890 --> 00:02:33,130
All right so now let's look at an example.

34
00:02:33,210 --> 00:02:35,010
We're going to look at an example here.

35
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:43,490
We've got some placeholders where application will be demonstrated and is coming from the left and then

36
00:02:44,020 --> 00:02:50,000
at some point this red line demonstrates illustrates where the fork actually happened or start of a

37
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,090
hard fork and a great example of hard work is.

38
00:02:54,470 --> 00:03:00,170
First I wanted to mention that in our placeholders we're going to have two rows the top row is four

39
00:03:00,170 --> 00:03:03,630
miners who haven't upgraded to the new rules.

40
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,080
And the bottom row is for miners who have upgraded to the new rules as our blog why would be on the

41
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:11,170
top or on the bottom.

42
00:03:11,210 --> 00:03:18,300
And the good example to start off with is the maximum block size increasing.

43
00:03:18,590 --> 00:03:23,770
While this is indeed an example of a hard fork as we know because that happened in real life.

44
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:25,610
Bitcoin and and there's been quite cash.

45
00:03:25,610 --> 00:03:30,590
That's exactly what happened Bitcoin has a box as of one megabyte and cash has a maximum block size

46
00:03:30,590 --> 00:03:31,860
of 8 megabytes.

47
00:03:31,880 --> 00:03:37,750
So in both cases a maximum size of one megabyte maxims and look make 8 megabytes.

48
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:45,680
And was it a hard for because as we discussed hard forks they tighten up the no hiding.

49
00:03:45,670 --> 00:03:47,690
Hard for say loosen up.

50
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:50,480
Reading is so hard for us.

51
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:55,630
You know loosen up the rules and therefore in bitcoin you can only have up to one megabyte.

52
00:03:55,640 --> 00:03:59,610
Now in the current cache you have a broader range.

53
00:03:59,620 --> 00:04:03,540
You can go all the way up to eight megabytes of rules have been loosened up.

54
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:08,290
And so let's have a look at how a hard fought might play out.

55
00:04:08,300 --> 00:04:12,830
So before the software is updated everybody's on the same chain.

56
00:04:13,010 --> 00:04:16,910
So each year everybody's together and then the software is updated.

57
00:04:16,930 --> 00:04:21,750
And then this happens some some decide to stay with the old rules.

58
00:04:21,770 --> 00:04:28,010
Some of the sites take the new rules and let's say that this block this first block after the upgrade

59
00:04:28,010 --> 00:04:36,200
is actually found by a minor who is sitting in this group and minor who decided not to upgrade and then

60
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:41,660
this blog is going to be under one megabyte let's say it's 0.7 megabytes.

61
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:49,250
And if this is the only change to the rules all the network forbit going cash.

62
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:54,260
So if this is the only change we look at a very trivial example that this is indeed the only change

63
00:04:54,260 --> 00:04:57,560
that occurred in Maxo blocks has increased.

64
00:04:57,710 --> 00:05:02,500
Well this block of 0.7 megabytes it follows the rules of the old network.

65
00:05:02,510 --> 00:05:03,090
Correct.

66
00:05:03,110 --> 00:05:08,300
Because this is one megabyte limit and it follows the rules of the new network.

67
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:08,800
Correct.

68
00:05:08,810 --> 00:05:15,140
Because this is eight megabytes them and so this block will be accepted by everybody in the total network

69
00:05:15,170 --> 00:05:19,940
of Bitcoin we can capture all of these miners all except this blog because it falls everybody's rules.

70
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:27,580
Great then let's say the next block is also found by miners in this group now a miner in that.

71
00:05:27,890 --> 00:05:31,130
Again zero point nine megabyte.

72
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:37,030
This blog follows the rules of the Bitcoin at work and the current cash flows everybody's rules so it's

73
00:05:37,040 --> 00:05:39,050
going to be accepted by everybody.

74
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:40,530
Again no conflict there.

75
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:48,320
But then let's say the next block is accepted or is found by a miner who is in this group who has has

76
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:54,370
a British soldier and let's say this blog is indeed eight megabytes in size.

77
00:05:54,500 --> 00:06:01,700
Then what happens here is that this block is now is now.

78
00:06:01,710 --> 00:06:06,260
Indeed indeed it follows the rules of the new network of liquid cash.

79
00:06:06,260 --> 00:06:06,680
Correct.

80
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:10,550
Because eight megabytes is in the limit of eight megabytes.

81
00:06:10,550 --> 00:06:16,370
However eight megabytes is way more than one make about and it doesn't follow the rules of the Bitcoin

82
00:06:16,640 --> 00:06:17,770
that rogue the old.

83
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:24,320
So what that means is that the miners that haven't upgrade to the new rules they will this they will

84
00:06:24,320 --> 00:06:30,680
reject this block they will not accept them into their chain they will they will look at it and they'll

85
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:35,150
say this is luck is invalid and they'll continue mining and eventually they'll find their own block

86
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:42,240
which will be one megabyte for example and this bloke will follow the rules of as you can either get

87
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:42,930
it or.

88
00:06:43,130 --> 00:06:50,540
And so this is where the split happens as soon as this situation occurs where something in the new rules

89
00:06:50,540 --> 00:06:58,480
which are broader which are looser like how like is found and it doesn't fit in with the old network.

90
00:06:58,670 --> 00:07:06,530
Then there's a split and so between cache will continue mining its own chain and Bitcoin will continue

91
00:07:06,530 --> 00:07:07,800
mining its own chain.

92
00:07:08,260 --> 00:07:16,100
And so as you can see what that means is that a hard fork and why it's called a heart for it is because

93
00:07:16,100 --> 00:07:18,470
it's not backwards compatible.

94
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:26,570
So as soon as something is found in this new chain with current cash for instance it will not be accepted

95
00:07:26,570 --> 00:07:38,760
so a block from a block found by miners who have a grade will generally never be accepted by a blog

96
00:07:38,790 --> 00:07:40,590
by the miners who haven't read.

97
00:07:40,590 --> 00:07:45,660
And that's why as soon as a block like this comes first then there's a split in the chain and that's

98
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:45,800
it.

99
00:07:45,810 --> 00:07:48,900
And then from then on forever there's going to be separate chains.

100
00:07:48,940 --> 00:07:53,940
It will them they will never come back together simply because it's back is not backwards compatible

101
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:01,830
and that's where was the hard for because it is like a hard to change it doesn't allow for the change

102
00:08:01,860 --> 00:08:06,160
to come back together it doesn't allow for the miners from all networks to accept those books and well

103
00:08:06,880 --> 00:08:07,230
there.

104
00:08:07,380 --> 00:08:08,310
So that's hard.

105
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:10,710
Heartful Now let's have a look at a sophomore.

106
00:08:11,010 --> 00:08:19,320
So for example again here we're going to have haven't upgraded on the top and have upgraded and so is

107
00:08:19,650 --> 00:08:25,170
the names are a bit different so here is haven't upgraded yet and have already agreed and that's shows

108
00:08:25,170 --> 00:08:34,520
that eventually in a soft for all minors will be forced to upgrade eventually so in the software you

109
00:08:34,550 --> 00:08:39,040
generally don't have a split of the network or split up the chains.

110
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:41,840
Is just going to be one chain and eventually all miners will go here.

111
00:08:42,040 --> 00:08:48,270
But what this word means here a majority it means that a Southfork only will will only actually happen

112
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:56,310
will only be initiated by the network when the majority agrees in advance.

113
00:08:56,310 --> 00:08:57,420
That's awful.

114
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:06,780
So in bitcoin like going into different networks the rules are different and that majority is a different

115
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:12,520
percentage so like this will be initiated only when a certain percentage of the miners agree to it.

116
00:09:12,580 --> 00:09:15,160
And it is is just it.

117
00:09:15,170 --> 00:09:16,980
And number above 50 percent.

118
00:09:16,980 --> 00:09:22,680
And again it depends on the network what it can be and the situation as well.

119
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:30,950
So what we're going to look at is a soft fork an example of when the maximum block size is decreased.

120
00:09:30,990 --> 00:09:34,740
We don't have an A real life example of that so we're going to make one up we're going to say that in

121
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:40,910
the aggregate was one made megabytes in the new network or in the in bitcoin.

122
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:46,260
Again it's the same that we're seeing here is that they're not going to actually split the chains are

123
00:09:46,260 --> 00:09:46,770
going to split.

124
00:09:46,780 --> 00:09:54,360
So the new rules as well as the new rules are that the Maximum block size is half a megabyte 0.5 megabytes

125
00:09:55,020 --> 00:09:56,420
and yeah.

126
00:09:56,430 --> 00:09:58,200
And so why is this a small.

127
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:07,860
Why is this soft for a while we know that the rules in a soft four are tied I tightened up and as we

128
00:10:07,860 --> 00:10:14,320
can see the R&amp;D tighten up so here we have a maximum boobs maximum block size of one megabyte.

129
00:10:14,510 --> 00:10:16,550
And now we have a smaller range.

130
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:18,700
We can only go up to zero point five million.

131
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:25,420
So it's constricting us more and therefore there was a tightening up and so it's software.

132
00:10:25,990 --> 00:10:33,200
So let's have a look the network is here so it can do it so the chain was comes up to here then the

133
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:38,510
rules are changed because the majority we have the majority who agreed to change the rules then from

134
00:10:38,510 --> 00:10:44,060
here what happens is well let's say that even though the majority is here let's say that the first block

135
00:10:44,060 --> 00:10:49,940
is actually found by a minor from this group it could totally happen right because what money lost is

136
00:10:49,940 --> 00:10:52,180
kind of like a lottery.

137
00:10:52,850 --> 00:10:57,740
And therefore it totally can happen that the first block here does fine by money from this group and

138
00:10:57,770 --> 00:11:02,800
let's say this block is in incise it is only 0.4 megabytes.

139
00:11:02,810 --> 00:11:08,200
Again that could also happen because blocks the size of the limits.

140
00:11:08,210 --> 00:11:13,770
Here we have here we can see here the maximum limit so a block could totally be like 0.4 megabytes.

141
00:11:14,420 --> 00:11:18,170
And so let's see what happens here.

142
00:11:18,180 --> 00:11:23,850
Let's check the rules so 0.4 megabytes does conform to the old rules.

143
00:11:23,870 --> 00:11:25,910
Yes it's accepted by these miners.

144
00:11:25,940 --> 00:11:30,860
Good and 0.4 megawatts also conforms to the new rules is less than half a megabyte.

145
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:31,490
Great.

146
00:11:31,550 --> 00:11:33,330
So it's also accepted by the miners.

147
00:11:33,350 --> 00:11:35,230
Amazing everything's fantastic.

148
00:11:35,270 --> 00:11:35,780
All right.

149
00:11:35,780 --> 00:11:37,340
So there's no conflict there.

150
00:11:37,340 --> 00:11:38,020
Then what happens.

151
00:11:38,030 --> 00:11:41,940
Let's say the next block is again followed by a minor from this group.

152
00:11:42,030 --> 00:11:43,770
Again that could happen as well.

153
00:11:44,300 --> 00:11:50,630
But this time the block is 0.9 megabytes and so now if we check the rules we'll see that 0.9 megabytes

154
00:11:50,750 --> 00:11:54,050
does conform to the neural to the old rules check.

155
00:11:54,050 --> 00:11:56,450
So it's accepted by these miners great.

156
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:04,780
However 0.9 megabytes doesn't conform to the new rules which are 0.5 megabytes it's 0.9 is greater than

157
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:10,250
the new and therefore it is not accepted by the whiners who have upgraded.

158
00:12:10,610 --> 00:12:19,250
So what's going to happen is they're going to see this block they're going to reject it as not not valid

159
00:12:19,340 --> 00:12:23,540
and therefore they are going to continue mining and eventually they'll find their own block which might

160
00:12:23,540 --> 00:12:25,610
be like 0.5 megabytes.

161
00:12:25,630 --> 00:12:28,120
Now this is where the interesting part happens.

162
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:30,810
So now we kind of have like a chain split right.

163
00:12:30,810 --> 00:12:37,280
So OK we're looks very it looks very similar to what happens in hard for we might like.

164
00:12:37,280 --> 00:12:42,170
Looks like we're about to have a chain split and these two chains are going to go their separate ways.

165
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,920
However this is the interesting part.

166
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,200
So because we have the majority of miners here right.

167
00:12:49,210 --> 00:12:54,020
The only software going to be initiated when we have now is just majority black prevailing which are

168
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,880
like 75 and 95 in a lot of miners sitting in there.

169
00:12:59,270 --> 00:13:07,750
Then what will on this site what'll happen is these miners are going to find the next block likely they're

170
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:09,670
going to find the next book faster.

171
00:13:10,040 --> 00:13:15,740
And so we will have a situation like this because there's more of them here and we'll have a new block

172
00:13:15,740 --> 00:13:16,320
here.

173
00:13:16,610 --> 00:13:26,660
And what that means is this block this is this is the key that this block is 0.5 megabytes and it follows

174
00:13:26,660 --> 00:13:31,820
the rules of the new network and it follows the rules of the old network as well.

175
00:13:31,850 --> 00:13:38,660
So that is where the backwards compatibility of a software comes out of that software is backwards compatible

176
00:13:38,660 --> 00:13:39,980
on like hardware.

177
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:47,060
So what that means is that these blocks found by new miters they will be accepted by the new miners

178
00:13:47,150 --> 00:13:48,560
and by the Obamas.

179
00:13:48,560 --> 00:13:50,480
And so what.

180
00:13:50,510 --> 00:13:53,070
So these miners they just see a chain like this great.

181
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,710
And what these miners see they see an or block situation they see a chain kind of split.

182
00:13:58,790 --> 00:14:00,680
So they see gays or pornography.

183
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:01,910
They also see this change.

184
00:14:01,910 --> 00:14:03,800
They accept these blocks as valid.

185
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:07,470
And so because they see this chain they see that this is the longer chain.

186
00:14:07,520 --> 00:14:13,550
And it does conform to their rules so they will reject they will reject whoops they'll reject this blog

187
00:14:13,790 --> 00:14:19,090
and will become an orphan block and they will continue with this chain the even the minors that haven't

188
00:14:19,090 --> 00:14:25,640
an upgrade simply because the new rules are stricter and tighter and therefore they still conform to

189
00:14:25,640 --> 00:14:27,280
the old rules.

190
00:14:27,280 --> 00:14:31,700
And so even if this doesn't happen like right away even if you have like 1 1 and then you have another

191
00:14:31,700 --> 00:14:32,600
1 1 1 1.

192
00:14:32,630 --> 00:14:36,640
Eventually because this moment is here eventually this chain will be longer.

193
00:14:36,650 --> 00:14:43,280
Eventually the blue channel way here will be longer and eventually this other chain will be rejected.

194
00:14:43,280 --> 00:14:49,910
And so the new miners will always win because their blocks are accepted by both the new and the old

195
00:14:49,910 --> 00:14:56,410
rules the old miners will always lose because their blocks are not accepted by the new rules and there

196
00:14:56,410 --> 00:15:03,950
is less of them less of the minors and so from there it will continue and again eventually like for

197
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:10,280
instance here maybe a minor from this group might find the next block great and it might be comparable

198
00:15:10,280 --> 00:15:11,850
to both rules great again.

199
00:15:12,020 --> 00:15:17,800
So it'll be accepted but then a Eventually the next block might be found by minors from this group and

200
00:15:17,800 --> 00:15:19,110
so on.

201
00:15:20,170 --> 00:15:28,270
And so in this case because of situations like this because of situations where there is a chance but

202
00:15:28,390 --> 00:15:30,760
then it turns into an orphan block situation.

203
00:15:30,790 --> 00:15:32,940
And the miners continue this way.

204
00:15:32,950 --> 00:15:36,060
Miners here are going to be at a disadvantage there.

205
00:15:36,070 --> 00:15:40,470
They are more likely to find blocks that are going to be rejected that are going to become or for blocks

206
00:15:40,840 --> 00:15:47,770
and that forces them to move to this group that forces them to accept the new rules and to play by the

207
00:15:47,770 --> 00:15:53,380
new rules that gives them the incentive to do that because otherwise they're going to be spending a

208
00:15:53,380 --> 00:15:59,530
lot of time and electricity mining blocks which are going to become invalid and they're not going to

209
00:15:59,530 --> 00:16:01,190
be getting their war.

210
00:16:01,390 --> 00:16:06,970
So that's the that's how software works very tricky like that.

211
00:16:06,970 --> 00:16:12,040
And the key here is backwards compatibility and that's why it's called the software because it's not

212
00:16:12,040 --> 00:16:13,530
a hard change in the rules.

213
00:16:13,690 --> 00:16:20,770
It's a soft change in the rules even though it can even though it's so because it makes rules tighter.

214
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:29,110
It's it means that it's a soft change in the sense that minors that it's still the new the new rules

215
00:16:29,110 --> 00:16:30,860
are still compatible.

216
00:16:30,910 --> 00:16:38,350
Excuse me they're still compatible The old rule so the new rules are kind of like a subgroup of the

217
00:16:38,350 --> 00:16:43,150
old rules and that's why I call this a fault because that insures backwards compatibility and that's

218
00:16:43,240 --> 00:16:50,950
that allows for this kind of like game scenario like competition scenario where these guys will always

219
00:16:50,950 --> 00:16:55,470
win and that forces the ones that have an upgrade to the majority.

220
00:16:55,640 --> 00:16:59,130
So for instance that's how Segway was accepted in the beginning.

221
00:16:59,590 --> 00:17:02,670
All right so there we go that's how the software works.

222
00:17:02,670 --> 00:17:10,870
And I know this especially this software business might be a bit complicated in that case there's great

223
00:17:10,870 --> 00:17:13,960
additional reading which I've bought for you.

224
00:17:13,960 --> 00:17:17,110
It's called The Complete Guide on Bitcoin and blotching for Spike.

225
00:17:17,180 --> 00:17:27,340
You had Z and it explains this whole situation with a great analogy of a restaurant the restaurant that's

226
00:17:27,340 --> 00:17:30,740
cooking vegetarian food and then they decide to introduce meat.

227
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,800
And that represents some hard for.

228
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:38,890
Or the entry they decide to introduce or decide to switch to only vegan recipes and that represents

229
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:40,110
a soft fall.

230
00:17:40,150 --> 00:17:47,050
And so a great analogy which can help you further understand this topic if you'd like to get a better

231
00:17:47,050 --> 00:17:48,070
grasp of it.

232
00:17:48,580 --> 00:17:51,550
But in general that's how soft often hard forks work.

233
00:17:51,550 --> 00:17:54,880
Hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and I look forward to see you next.

234
00:17:55,570 --> 00:17:57,620
Until then enjoy bludgeons.
