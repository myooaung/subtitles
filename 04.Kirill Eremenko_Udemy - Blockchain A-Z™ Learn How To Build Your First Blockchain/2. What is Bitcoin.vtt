00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:10.200
Hello and welcome back to the course and blotching super excited about this tutorial because today we're

2
00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:15.070
kicking of Munjal number two about crypto currencies.

3
00:00:15.070 --> 00:00:19.430
And in this literally when you talk about bitcoin What is Bitcoin.

4
00:00:19.660 --> 00:00:30.040
Moreover we're actually going to create a very clear understanding of different things like blog chain

5
00:00:30.340 --> 00:00:36.220
Bitcoins protocols coins tokens and things like that because there's a lot of confusion out there.

6
00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:38.070
There are a lot of misleading terms.

7
00:00:38.100 --> 00:00:44.950
We're going to clear that up once and for all so we lay a very very good foundation for us to move forward

8
00:00:45.040 --> 00:00:47.380
with the rest of this module and the rest of the course.

9
00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:51.690
All right so let's dive straight into it in the crypto world.

10
00:00:51.700 --> 00:00:54.520
There are three very important layers.

11
00:00:54.520 --> 00:00:56.710
Layer one is technology.

12
00:00:57.010 --> 00:01:03.510
There too is protocol and also includes coin and layer three is tokin.

13
00:01:03.850 --> 00:01:10.510
And this is going to be our roadmap of how where everything fits in how the puzzle comes together at

14
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.260
the top.

15
00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:17.980
We've got blotching that is the technology that we've been talking about in module one and we've discussed

16
00:01:17.980 --> 00:01:20.520
in detail we know how it works.

17
00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:30.270
Then in Layer 2 in the protocol there we have things like Bitcoin and it's very important here to understand

18
00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:32.880
that Bitcoin is not just a coin.

19
00:01:32.910 --> 00:01:36.760
It's not just a currency it's an actual protocol.

20
00:01:36.820 --> 00:01:43.890
And what is a protocol protocol is a set of rules that guys how participants over a network communicate

21
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:44.710
with each other.

22
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:49.260
For example TCAP or IP or HTP.

23
00:01:49.260 --> 00:01:55.920
Those are all protocols because they allow participants of networks to communicate with each other the

24
00:01:55.950 --> 00:02:00.900
IP port of call is the internet Percoco allows us all to participate in the Internet.

25
00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:09.520
HD T is a hypertext transfer protocol which allows our browsers to display Web sites correctly.

26
00:02:09.570 --> 00:02:10.890
Bitcoin is no different.

27
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:17.520
It is a protocol is a set of rules on how participants of the end of the bitcoin network will communicate

28
00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:20.110
with each other and agree on things.

29
00:02:20.130 --> 00:02:25.320
For example the protocol dictates how they should come to consensus of things we've talked about that

30
00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:31.710
before the protocol also dictates how public keys and signatures should be used for authentication.

31
00:02:31.860 --> 00:02:34.970
And that's something we'll talk about later down further down on the course.

32
00:02:34.980 --> 00:02:42.900
The protocol also dictates on how they agree on updates to the protocol itself and lots more other things

33
00:02:43.020 --> 00:02:47.750
that are required in order for this whole network to function correctly.

34
00:02:47.790 --> 00:02:52.530
There's also other protocols in the world of crypto for example.

35
00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:53.410
There is a protocol.

36
00:02:53.430 --> 00:02:56.840
You may have heard of Theertham very very famous protocol.

37
00:02:57.210 --> 00:02:59.240
And we'll talk more about it in this course.

38
00:02:59.240 --> 00:03:06.570
Of course there's also Ripl is Neal there's waves and there's lots and lots more others that just there's

39
00:03:06.570 --> 00:03:09.800
not enough space in this slide to fit them all in life.

40
00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.830
Cohen is a protocol.

41
00:03:10.830 --> 00:03:19.110
Bitcoin caches of protocols that caches a protocol Manero is a protocol there's lots of different protocols

42
00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:27.970
in the world of crypto currencies which all rely on the same technology and technology is blocking.

43
00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:37.090
Now the next step is that protocols actually contain within them an important feature and that feature

44
00:03:37.090 --> 00:03:41.070
is called the coin each one of these protocols has its own coins.

45
00:03:41.070 --> 00:03:42.580
Bitcoin has the Bitcoin.

46
00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:48.490
The theory has either a ripple ripple is usually just named after the protocol itself.

47
00:03:48.730 --> 00:03:54.460
But there's only one coin attached to every particle every particle has a coin attached to it and the

48
00:03:54.460 --> 00:04:03.160
coin is an innate asset of the protocol which facilitates the interaction of players which is used to

49
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:11.860
reward people for mining the block chain and adding clocks is also used for people to be able to purchase

50
00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:13.630
things from each other and so on.

51
00:04:13.630 --> 00:04:16.650
So that is the coin.

52
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:24.060
Next we move on two way or three and layer three is the token and a token is when you hear the term

53
00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:26.210
I see your initial coin offering.

54
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:28.650
It's a very very misleading term.

55
00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:33.960
It's a great term but it's misleading because ICAO is actually about tokens.

56
00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:39.430
So I suppose even those called initial court offering is what they're offering are tokens and we'll

57
00:04:39.430 --> 00:04:44.950
talk more about CEOs and tokens in modules 3 of course but right now it's important to understand the

58
00:04:44.950 --> 00:04:49.740
difference that coins are in Layer 2 tokens are in Layer 3.

59
00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:57.460
So tokens they rely on smart contracts which are built on top of the different protocols we see in Lehre

60
00:04:57.570 --> 00:05:06.160
to for example in Theorem A It is the most popular protocol for creating smart card tracks and for creating

61
00:05:06.190 --> 00:05:11.100
therefore for tokens it has the highest number of tokens as hundreds of tokens on a theory.

62
00:05:11.230 --> 00:05:17.770
There is just a couple of examples of them in for instance Bitcoin has no tokens on it because it does

63
00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:25.440
not facilitate that concept of creating smart contracts and therefore nobody creates tokens on Bitcoins

64
00:05:25.450 --> 00:05:28.000
you just can't do that.

65
00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.170
Ripl also doesn't have any tokens on it.

66
00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:38.110
Nio on the other hand has quite a lot of tokens in it was the up and coming challenger of lithium and

67
00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:40.850
Wavves has a couple of tokens on it as well.

68
00:05:41.610 --> 00:05:49.800
So that's how the world of crypto currencies and just crypto technology and blotching works as you can

69
00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.370
see this.

70
00:05:50.370 --> 00:05:56.800
Three players discussed this lair in which one is going to be talking about this later in module to

71
00:05:57.010 --> 00:06:04.290
her dominantly about this lair and this player will be covering of which all three are now very important

72
00:06:04.290 --> 00:06:07.380
to understand the difference between a coin and a token.

73
00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:12.930
And that I suppose refer to tokens rather than coins as.

74
00:06:13.230 --> 00:06:13.490
Yeah.

75
00:06:13.500 --> 00:06:19.410
And let's have a look now at this Web site here which is gold coin market cap dot com.

76
00:06:19.410 --> 00:06:24.780
You've probably seen people reference this website if you've been dabbling in the world of cryptocurrency

77
00:06:24.810 --> 00:06:31.740
and maybe watching some videos on youtube then you would have seen people reference and market cap dot

78
00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:38.610
com and come here to explore things like the volume or the trading volume the market capitalization

79
00:06:38.610 --> 00:06:42.670
of currency the graphs the prices and so on.

80
00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:48.600
And so right away you can see there's like hundreds and hundreds of Crypta currencies but the whole

81
00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.140
term.

82
00:06:49.230 --> 00:06:55.990
Then look at the market market capitalization of everything together 442 billion dollars.

83
00:06:56.040 --> 00:06:57.730
That's insane.

84
00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:04.080
So what is a bit confusing here is a whole term cryptocurrency.

85
00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.410
What does that refer to does refer to the coins or the tokens.

86
00:07:07.410 --> 00:07:13.940
That's why Luckily they have here a button or two tabs for one for coins and one for tokens.

87
00:07:13.940 --> 00:07:20.130
And that's exactly what we spoke about that here right now we have a mix of coins and tokens and we

88
00:07:20.130 --> 00:07:25.420
can go into coins to see those coins that we'll be talking about in.

89
00:07:25.470 --> 00:07:28.170
So even here it's important to understand the difference right.

90
00:07:28.170 --> 00:07:35.010
So if you if somebody is investing into a coin they're investing into the protocol of that underlying

91
00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:35.470
that coin.

92
00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:38.220
So Bitcoin or Theoria ripple and so on.

93
00:07:38.430 --> 00:07:44.970
If they're investing a token then you're investing into the idea behind what they're building.

94
00:07:45.010 --> 00:07:51.980
So you can see that which which tokens are on which platform you mysterium so this token is on.

95
00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.230
These are mostly theories and this one is Neo.

96
00:07:57.090 --> 00:08:02.580
And on many another one our doors so very interesting situation there red pulses Neo.

97
00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.200
So and if you're investing into tokin you're investing to you but we're not going to be talking about

98
00:08:07.200 --> 00:08:09.080
investing right now.

99
00:08:09.120 --> 00:08:12.700
The whole point is that coins are different tokens.

100
00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:17.820
And the other point is that there's tons of them as you can see there's tons of them and so what we'll

101
00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:21.380
be covering often this course is predominantly about Bitcoin.

102
00:08:21.630 --> 00:08:27.710
But at the same time a lot of the concepts are applicable across different coins and protocols.

103
00:08:27.710 --> 00:08:31.790
The reason why we are using bitcoin because it's the most famous one it's the most popular one.

104
00:08:31.830 --> 00:08:38.250
It's it's the law is the one that's been around for the longest and it's much better to color off all

105
00:08:38.250 --> 00:08:39.100
of these things.

106
00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:45.750
We are working example rather than just talking about general theoretical ideas and that will put things

107
00:08:45.750 --> 00:08:49.920
into perspective and then if you ever want to move on to something else like Ethereal ripple like coin

108
00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:53.560
and learn about it you will be very easy to transfer the knowledge.

109
00:08:53.880 --> 00:08:54.540
OK.

110
00:08:54.720 --> 00:09:00.280
And so let's quickly talk about what bitcoin actually is.

111
00:09:00.360 --> 00:09:10.350
So because it was invented in 2008 by a person or people who were operating under the name Satoshi Nakamoto

112
00:09:10.650 --> 00:09:14.040
nobody knows exactly who Sudarshan Okamoto is.

113
00:09:14.250 --> 00:09:19.860
They don't know if it's one person or many people and it's still a mystery but nevertheless there is

114
00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:27.360
a white paper published under the name of a company that Comodo happened 2008 which explains this whole

115
00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:32.380
system in a lot of detail all of the ideas many of the ideas that we talked about in my show one many

116
00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.830
of the ideas that we'll talk about and module to here and then in 2009 the bitcoin system was implemented.

117
00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:47.520
There's actually a really cool viz. of from like of the good Hobb repository how it was changing and

118
00:09:47.520 --> 00:09:58.110
we show how Bitcoin was like it was created which people worked on Bitcoin and so on and so yeah.

119
00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:03.780
It started in 2009 so it's almost 10 years old and it's going to and is still being developed.

120
00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:05.500
It's like always growing.

121
00:10:05.540 --> 00:10:10.360
There's lots of all participants So what is Bitcoin all about.

122
00:10:10.410 --> 00:10:16.560
Well Bitcoin is about taking that block change technology which we covered in detail in module 1 and

123
00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.800
take it taking it from theory and moving into practice so that a network of people can transact for

124
00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:24.830
each other using this technology.

125
00:10:24.930 --> 00:10:30.560
So that's now all of a sudden they don't need intermediaries between them that even though they haven't

126
00:10:30.570 --> 00:10:36.780
never met each other they can still trust each other because they trust the technology behind it and

127
00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:42.780
that pulls out all of the different intermediaries such as banks from the system.

128
00:10:42.990 --> 00:10:52.680
So that layer 2 is about creating a protocol of helping people transact an inherent component of transacting

129
00:10:52.770 --> 00:10:54.700
is exchange of value.

130
00:10:54.840 --> 00:11:02.910
And that's why the Quine's are part of a letter to their part of the protocol and that's why the protocol

131
00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:08.280
removes one of the biggest intermediaries that we know about is the banking sector because the banking

132
00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:14.250
system as you can see there's like no bank in the middle here that people are acting at the same time

133
00:11:14.260 --> 00:11:19.080
we know that blotching can be used for many different things from healthcare to media distribution to

134
00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.250
logistics.

135
00:11:20.250 --> 00:11:22.930
Pretty much any industry you think of it can be used.

136
00:11:23.100 --> 00:11:31.130
Well that can be built on top of the protocol that is created by a big core theory aminal and so on

137
00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.640
and that's where the tokens come and that's the next Lasley or three when we disrupt other industries

138
00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:42.870
and in Layer 2 it's about creating this system where people can transact with each other and as a part

139
00:11:42.870 --> 00:11:48.900
of it removing the banking intermedius because Pa an important component of transparency is exchange

140
00:11:48.900 --> 00:11:49.680
of value.

141
00:11:50.070 --> 00:11:58.260
And finally the Bitcoin ecosystem includes the falling participants there are nodes and it's not a term

142
00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:04.620
for people it's a term for rather the devices that people use that participant and which are not mining

143
00:12:04.710 --> 00:12:05.420
the network.

144
00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:11.790
So just people who were devices of people who want to transact with each other on this network there's

145
00:12:11.790 --> 00:12:17.460
minors and prove following the tradition from Mudgal one which is going to keep representing minors

146
00:12:17.480 --> 00:12:24.120
with a laptop and these are participants who actually help the blog chain itself grow by mining it by

147
00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:27.930
adding transactions into blocks and blocks into the block chain.

148
00:12:28.290 --> 00:12:32.420
There are large miners we'll see examples of those.

149
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:40.400
These are miners with lots and lots of power lots and lots of devices and equipment which have a lot

150
00:12:40.590 --> 00:12:44.200
of make a contribution to the growth of the chain.

151
00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:51.780
And they are mining pools that's when miners get together to work together on the mining process.

152
00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:52.440
So there we go.

153
00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:58.890
That is what's been causal about that's the Bitcoin ecosystem and probably the most important thing

154
00:12:58.890 --> 00:13:07.430
to remember is that Bitcoin is a protocol it's just a coin it's a protocol that facilitates that long

155
00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.560
technology and makes it come to life.

156
00:13:09.570 --> 00:13:12.230
Just one of the Protocols is multiple different.

157
00:13:12.690 --> 00:13:18.040
And on that note here is a suggestion for additional reading.

00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:24.810
This is the actual original white paper by Santoshi that Come-Outer is called Bitcoin a peer to peer

159
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:26.520
electronic cash system.

160
00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:28.630
And you can find it on the Bitcoin website.

161
00:13:28.920 --> 00:13:32.070
Bitcoin dot org says Bitcoin PTF.

162
00:13:32.310 --> 00:13:33.100
Interesting read.

163
00:13:33.120 --> 00:13:34.890
I wouldn't say that it's too technical.

164
00:13:34.890 --> 00:13:40.260
Some parts are technical but there is no complex math or a god or even just like looking at the paper

165
00:13:40.260 --> 00:13:48.870
and reading the abstract and the first couple of pages can be useful just for understanding where all

166
00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:54.750
of these things came from that are changing the world that are disrupting the way we think and that

167
00:13:54.790 --> 00:13:59.340
it's going to be one of the biggest disruptors in the next 10 years.

168
00:13:59.370 --> 00:14:05.580
And on that note I hope you enjoyed today's tutorial and if things are much clearer now and we've laid

169
00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:11.810
a good foundation for the rest of the course going forward I look forward to seeing you back here next.

170
00:14:11.870 --> 00:14:13.800
And until then enjoy bludgeons.
