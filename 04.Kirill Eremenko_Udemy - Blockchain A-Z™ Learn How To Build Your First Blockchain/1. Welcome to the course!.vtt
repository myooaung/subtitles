00:00:00.330 --> 00:00:03.080
Hello welcome to the course on block chain.

2
00:00:03.150 --> 00:00:09.870
My name is curial Eremenko and I will be one of your two instructors on this course and I'm super excited

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:17.220
to welcome you into this training program and the purpose of this first tutorial is to look at the structure

4
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.950
of the course to help you navigate it better as you go through the tutorials later on.

5
00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.820
So let's have a look at how this course comes together.

6
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:32.850
First of all in this course we will start off by talking about module one block chain intuition.

7
00:00:33.210 --> 00:00:39.900
So Atlanta and I are both big believers in the fact that intuition is a very important component of

8
00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:47.910
learning complex topics such as block chain and in in the intuition tutorials will understand everything

9
00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:53.940
that we need to know about the fundamentals of block chain on a very intuitive level so it just makes

10
00:00:53.940 --> 00:00:55.140
sense.

11
00:00:55.210 --> 00:01:01.520
And then after module one after the intuition of Module 1 you will have the practical side of module

12
00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:08.310
one which is creating a general purpose block chain where Adeline will walk you through step by step

13
00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:11.090
of how to program your own blotching.

14
00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:17.430
Then we'll move on to module 2 which consists of two parts in terms of the intuition module to a is

15
00:01:17.610 --> 00:01:24.940
the cryptocurrency intuition where you will found out all of the fundamentals of how cryptocurrency

16
00:01:24.940 --> 00:01:30.470
is work and module to be is the crew to currency transactions intuition.

17
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:37.310
Where will we will deep dig even deeper into how the transactions work for cryptocurrency.

18
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:43.770
So basically module 2 will be building upon what we learn in Module 1.

19
00:01:43.910 --> 00:01:49.760
It will help us delve deeper into the application of block chain which one of the allegations which

20
00:01:49.760 --> 00:01:51.160
is cryptocurrency.

21
00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:56.240
Then again you will have a practical session a practical module.

22
00:01:56.570 --> 00:02:03.800
Where at lunch walk you step by step through the process of coding your own cryptocurrency using that

23
00:02:03.800 --> 00:02:09.500
general purpose block chain that we created in the first module and then finally will have module 3

24
00:02:09.530 --> 00:02:17.240
create a smart contract in module 3 in the intuition of smart contracts will talk about what these smart

25
00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:25.640
contracts are why they mean the next future for the Internet and how this is all related to block and

26
00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:27.760
how it all comes together on block chain.

27
00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:32.460
And once again we will build on the foundational knowledge that we have.

28
00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:39.580
We would have covered by then in Module 1 and modules to and at the same time again you will have a

29
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:45.550
practical component for module 3 which is create a smart contract where Adlon will walk you step by

30
00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:52.450
step through creating a smart contract and actually launching or imitating an ice CEO to see how those

31
00:02:52.450 --> 00:02:56.220
smart contracts can be used in the real world.

32
00:02:56.230 --> 00:02:59.820
So now a couple of comments about how you could go through this course.

33
00:02:59.830 --> 00:03:05.550
There are a couple of ways how to traverse through through these tutorials.

34
00:03:05.590 --> 00:03:11.270
The first way would be the full monty and that is to go through every module.

35
00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:17.920
And bear in mind that every module here contains multiple tutorials between 10 and even more up to 20

36
00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:25.090
tutorials and every single Munjal and the Full Monty would include going through them one by one like

37
00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:31.330
this so much a one intuition then one practical module to intuition to practice them with your three

38
00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:35.950
intuition module through practical and that way you will cover absolutely everything.

39
00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:41.290
However this will take a lot of time and in this case you will need to do both the intuition and the

40
00:03:41.290 --> 00:03:42.490
coding aspects.

41
00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.410
So that's the full monty approach.

42
00:03:44.410 --> 00:03:52.480
That's of course the most challenging approach and most thorough approach at the same time.

43
00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.430
Having said that you might have a different goal for this course.

44
00:03:57.430 --> 00:04:02.980
Your goal for this course might not be to become a block chain developer you might not want to code

45
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:04.120
and that's totally fine.

46
00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.730
So I really wanted to stress this and do this tutorial that if you're taking this course to learn about

47
00:04:09.730 --> 00:04:15.370
block chain and maybe start a consulting business and block chain or maybe apply block chain in your

48
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:22.150
own work or develop some sort of strategy for your business or involve chain and you don't really want

49
00:04:22.150 --> 00:04:22.450
to code.

50
00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:23.990
That's totally fine too.

51
00:04:24.070 --> 00:04:32.140
In that case for instance you could take the block chain expert or expert block chain knowledge path

52
00:04:32.140 --> 00:04:37.780
through the course and you could simply go through module one intuition module to intuition and module

53
00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:43.840
through intuition completely disregarding the coding aspects of it and the beautiful part about this

54
00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:49.360
course is that if you ever do want to get into coding you can always come back and do the coding later

55
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.670
and learn those things later.

56
00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:55.090
We specifically structure the course in the way that you can take the intuition tutorials which are

57
00:04:55.090 --> 00:04:59.470
highlighted here or the modules that are highlighted here in green were found having to go into the

58
00:04:59.470 --> 00:05:02.760
purple modules and still get all of that.

59
00:05:02.770 --> 00:05:09.580
All those foundations all of that knowledge which will take you into the top five to 10 percent of people

60
00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:15.460
on the planet who know about blotching that is in itself extremely valuable.

61
00:05:15.460 --> 00:05:22.500
Once again for publications such as consulting space or block chain or strategy in the space of launching

62
00:05:22.540 --> 00:05:27.670
and block change of business or just general knowledge about blocking and to see how it might disrupt

63
00:05:27.670 --> 00:05:28.740
your profession.

64
00:05:29.110 --> 00:05:36.250
And finally if you don't have that much time where you don't want to dive into the technicalities of

65
00:05:36.250 --> 00:05:41.980
certain aspects such as crypto currencies and smart contracts you can go down the path which is block

66
00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:48.090
chain fundamentals and that is simply by taking module one block chain intuition and nothing else.

67
00:05:48.130 --> 00:05:56.080
Even if you just complete the first part of this course the intuition tutorials for Module 1 you will

68
00:05:56.260 --> 00:06:04.350
already be very well equipped to have conversations about block chain to understand what it is and to

69
00:06:04.350 --> 00:06:10.530
explain to others how it works how different components where there is decentralization whether it's

70
00:06:10.650 --> 00:06:16.920
hash cryptography whether it's the Byzantine full tolerance how all of these things work and how they

71
00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:20.340
come together to create this new phenomenon which is blotching.

72
00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:26.190
And finally it's also worth mentioning that you can take these modules and these are drolls in any order

73
00:06:26.220 --> 00:06:30.130
you like for instance you might want to just jump straight into module 3.

74
00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.840
And the more the intuition and the practical part if you feel that you have a good grounding in everything

75
00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:39.630
else you can always come back to the course later on.

76
00:06:39.630 --> 00:06:42.870
You can take the tutorials and in your order that you like.

77
00:06:42.990 --> 00:06:46.510
Those were just some of the recommendations that we've come up with.

78
00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.720
And on that note I hope you're super excited about this course as excited as we are.

79
00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.810
Can't wait to see on the first tutorial.

80
00:06:53.910 --> 00:06:55.860
And let's just straight into it.

81
00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:57.930
And until next time enjoy blockaders.
