1
00:00:04,770 --> 00:00:06,570
Hayyeh is welcome to this need to toil.

2
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,400
So this is a quick one to make everything ready for demo and therefore we're going to prepare the Jason

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,520
foules that will need to post and post man when we interact with our blood chain to exchange some crypto

4
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:18,310
currencies.

5
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:24,210
So we'll have actually to Jason foules to make one Jayson file that will contain all the addresses of

6
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,610
the notes and one of the Jayson feathers will contain the format of a transaction you know will prepare

7
00:00:29,910 --> 00:00:32,400
the right format with the right three keys.

8
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:38,250
Send the receiver an amount that will get something ready to post in postman and also what you will

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:45,470
do in this pre final tutorial is get our servers ready and to do this will make actually three bytes

10
00:00:45,470 --> 00:00:51,570
and fouls each of them will be connected to a different port one port for me one port for curial and

11
00:00:51,570 --> 00:00:52,570
one port for you.

12
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:57,990
So I will be on port five thousand one Kyrle will be on port five thousand two and you will be on port

13
00:00:57,990 --> 00:01:04,140
five thousand three and you will see in the demo I will send lot of coin's to Israel and even more had

14
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:05,020
comments to you.

15
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:11,110
So lets do all this in the Statoil So that will be 100 percent ready in the next tutorial for the demo.

16
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:16,950
All right so first of all let's make the Jayson files and we are going to start with the Jayson file

17
00:01:16,950 --> 00:01:22,790
for the notes and so very simply to create this doesn't file will go to the top here.

18
00:01:22,800 --> 00:01:26,670
In Python you click on file you then click on new file.

19
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:27,450
There we go.

20
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:32,040
And the year you select everything and delete and we are going to save that.

21
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:37,060
So I'm pressing the shortcut CMD your control plus S to save here.

22
00:01:37,090 --> 00:01:40,790
I'm in the right for that that is Mudgal to create a cryptocurrency.

23
00:01:40,980 --> 00:01:46,560
And now just before we give a name to our file Well we are going to change the type of this file because

24
00:01:46,770 --> 00:01:52,770
you know the adjacent file is not a python file but JS and foul so sorry you cannot see here because

25
00:01:52,770 --> 00:01:56,110
it's out of the screen but I'm selecting it right now.

26
00:01:56,190 --> 00:01:57,790
You should be able to find it.

27
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:00,000
Jason foules you said this.

28
00:02:00,030 --> 00:02:02,080
And there we go we can change the name now.

29
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:04,390
And we're going to choose the following name.

30
00:02:04,540 --> 00:02:10,050
Note very simply because in this days in fact we're going to register the addresses of the notes we

31
00:02:10,050 --> 00:02:12,940
want to have in our de-centralized block chain.

32
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:20,640
So if you're ready note all good let's press say OK and now we're about to implement our very first

33
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:25,330
Jason File which will be used for our very first post and Postman.

34
00:02:25,530 --> 00:02:31,710
So you'll see it's going to be very simple to make edges and found you need to start with brackets and

35
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,680
now we're going to press enter twice because we are going to put the key and the value of the key in

36
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:39,370
the center of these brackets.

37
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:46,020
But before we input them make sure to press tab and then you can enter the name of the key and then

38
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:47,220
the value of the key.

39
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,010
So now the question is what keys do we have for nodes Jason foul.

40
00:02:52,170 --> 00:02:59,670
Well remember there is only one key which is the note notes key and remember that is the key that contains

41
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:03,620
the addresses of all the notes we should have in the network.

42
00:03:03,630 --> 00:03:05,220
So that's the key.

43
00:03:05,220 --> 00:03:12,990
And now Gullan And here we enter the value of this key and the value as we just said is the list of

44
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:16,930
the different addresses of the node we want to have in our network.

45
00:03:16,950 --> 00:03:22,170
And so as I said at the beginning of this tutorial we're going to have three notes one for me one for

46
00:03:22,170 --> 00:03:23,620
curial and one for you.

47
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:30,120
And so we need to input three addresses which we can differentiate with three different points and these

48
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:33,010
boards are going to be port five thousand one for me.

49
00:03:33,090 --> 00:03:37,030
Port five thousand two for keel and port five thousand three for you.

50
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:44,180
So let's do this let's put these addresses in this list and remember the addresses are the following.

51
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,150
HTP colon slash slash one hundred twenty seven point open open.

52
00:03:50,340 --> 00:03:52,670
That's the menu to denote will be sharing.

53
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:55,220
And then we need to add the port.

54
00:03:55,290 --> 00:04:00,540
And so as we said we're going to have three ports starting from five thousand one and then five thousand

55
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:02,970
two and then five thousand three.

56
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:05,230
All right so that's the first address.

57
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,740
And now I just added it come up because we're going to answer the other addresses too more.

58
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:17,420
So I'm copying this than here let's press Enter let's a line at the right level here.

59
00:04:17,430 --> 00:04:19,280
All right then let's paste.

60
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:27,070
This is our second address so you know Same deal here but then a different port five thousand two.

61
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:28,890
So that's the address for curial.

62
00:04:28,890 --> 00:04:31,790
And finally one address for you.

63
00:04:31,830 --> 00:04:35,780
There we go and you will have port five thousand three.

64
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:36,760
Perfect.

65
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:37,500
And that's done.

66
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,620
That's our Jason felt for the note as you see it's very simple.

67
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:46,170
Now we're going to save it and we're going to move on to the next Jason File which is the file for the

68
00:04:46,170 --> 00:04:46,990
transaction.

69
00:04:47,190 --> 00:04:51,600
So we're going to do exactly the same we're going to go to file at the top then we're going to click

70
00:04:51,600 --> 00:05:00,180
on new file and then we're going to select this and remove this then save then let's not forget to select

71
00:05:00,390 --> 00:05:05,310
the right type which is Jason Jason foules.

72
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:11,900
And then we're going to give a name here which will be transaction transaction and not transactions

73
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:14,730
because we just add one transaction at a time.

74
00:05:14,920 --> 00:05:15,580
All right.

75
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:18,510
And then we can click on Save.

76
00:05:18,650 --> 00:05:19,420
All good.

77
00:05:19,460 --> 00:05:23,270
Now we are ready to implement this transaction Jayson.

78
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,270
So now please press pause on the video and try to make this transaction yourself before I do it.

79
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,360
I'm going to do it now.

80
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:31,750
So of course we start with brackets.

81
00:05:31,930 --> 00:05:38,470
Then double enter and inside we put our three keys after pressing tab.

82
00:05:38,600 --> 00:05:41,780
So the first key is the sender.

83
00:05:41,780 --> 00:05:45,440
Then the second key is the receiver.

84
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:52,030
And then the third key is the amount of coins exchanged between the sender and the receiver.

85
00:05:52,070 --> 00:05:57,190
And more specifically this is the amount of at coins that the sender sent to the receiver.

86
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:57,930
All right.

87
00:05:58,010 --> 00:05:58,560
Now.

88
00:05:58,580 --> 00:06:05,060
So as I told you this is just going to be a prepared format which means that so far the values will

89
00:06:05,060 --> 00:06:08,720
simply enter some quotes here and here as well.

90
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,920
And the amount doesn't get a string.

91
00:06:10,970 --> 00:06:17,020
So we'll just put a space here and we'll enter a number for example 10 and then you'll see when we post

92
00:06:17,020 --> 00:06:18,390
a transaction in Postman.

93
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:25,100
Well what we'll do is we'll select all this will copy it and we'll paste in postman to input the right

94
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:31,160
values for the sender the receiver and the amount and then will the consent or press enter to send the

95
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:33,140
request to add a new transaction.

96
00:06:33,410 --> 00:06:35,950
But this is just to prepare the format of a transaction.

97
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,570
However for the notes we already entered the value for the notes key.

98
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:40,590
Okay.

99
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:42,530
So our Jason fells already.

100
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:49,850
And so now just to finish this toil and then we'll be 100 percent ready for the demo is we will prepare

101
00:06:49,970 --> 00:06:54,970
the three bison foules which will represent our servers to of our block chain.

102
00:06:55,130 --> 00:07:00,980
So our blood will be a decentralized network of 3 nodes and so basically what we're about to do now

103
00:07:01,220 --> 00:07:02,670
is get these notes around.

104
00:07:02,810 --> 00:07:10,100
So I'm not going to nullify this because this is our final code final implementation so let's save it

105
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:10,580
for now.

106
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:18,350
Without any further modification and therefore we're going to make three new files one failure a second

107
00:07:18,350 --> 00:07:25,710
one and a third Nouvelle and we're going to copy paste the at coin implementation.

108
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:33,280
Inside each of them and we will replace what needs to be replaced that is first the port.

109
00:07:33,290 --> 00:07:37,220
So here this is my notes that will be on board five thousand one.

110
00:07:37,580 --> 00:07:42,200
And the request to mine a new block is OK because the receiver is large.

111
00:07:42,210 --> 00:07:43,120
So that's all good.

112
00:07:43,250 --> 00:07:53,460
So I'm going to save this file and I'm going to call it at coin node five thousand one writes this will

113
00:07:53,460 --> 00:07:54,630
be my note.

114
00:07:54,620 --> 00:07:57,530
Now let's get is not ready.

115
00:07:57,690 --> 00:08:06,010
This is going to be this one selecting on this pasting and curial will be on port five thousand two

116
00:08:06,570 --> 00:08:08,230
and here to mine a block.

117
00:08:08,250 --> 00:08:12,460
Well the receiver will no longer be Adler but curial.

118
00:08:12,940 --> 00:08:23,100
OK let's save that and let's replace it by that coin note five thousand to perfect curial notes is ready.

119
00:08:23,170 --> 00:08:25,860
And now let's get your node ready.

120
00:08:25,860 --> 00:08:35,060
So again selecting on this pacing you will be on port five thousand three and here when you mind a plug

121
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:39,880
the receiver will no longer be Adna or Curiel it will be you.

122
00:08:40,350 --> 00:08:41,630
All right let's save it.

123
00:08:41,730 --> 00:08:42,690
There we go.

124
00:08:42,690 --> 00:08:51,120
Here you can just like this to be more efficient and you'll be on point five thousand three save all

125
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:55,150
good port five thousand three let's check if everything's OK here.

126
00:08:55,150 --> 00:08:58,320
Port five thousand one Adlon here.

127
00:08:59,090 --> 00:09:04,710
Port five thousand two curial and eventually port five thousand three.

128
00:09:04,890 --> 00:09:05,930
You.

129
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:06,430
Right.

130
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:09,270
And now we're all good 100 percent ready.

131
00:09:09,270 --> 00:09:11,710
So let's mesh this in the next tutorial.
