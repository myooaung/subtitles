00:00:00.570 --> 00:00:01.490
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:01.490 --> 00:00:04.900
So of course unblushing And today we're going to have a different tutorial.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:11.940
We're not going to go into the technicalities or philosophies of Bitcoin and block chain but rather

4
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.960
we're going to see how Bitcoin mining big bitcoin mining actually works under the hood.

5
00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:21.320
So let's have a look here.

6
00:00:21.380 --> 00:00:29.060
We've got an article from Quartz So definitely check it out at Quartz news at dot com.

7
00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:34.490
It's called photos photos inside one of the largest bitcoin mines.

8
00:00:35.290 --> 00:00:42.720
And so bitcoin as we could see previously the cryptographic puzzle is extremely complex and you need

9
00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:45.600
a lot of computing power to solve it.

10
00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.630
A lot of hash power.

11
00:00:46.640 --> 00:00:47.230
So.

12
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:55.250
So here is an example of what it looks like inside one of these industrial level Bitcoin mines.

13
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:00.090
So it's a great great piece by quartz.

14
00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.100
If you'd like to have a look more I'm always just going to look through the photos so here you can see

15
00:01:05.100 --> 00:01:12.670
like hanger's hangers all of this of these rigs.

16
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:20.210
Look at that like huge stoles with all these Bitcoin miners inside they have numbers they're all connected

17
00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:21.540
they're all just churning away

18
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:28.840
as a form of how much imagine how much electricity is going into that.

19
00:01:29.340 --> 00:01:37.440
Then you can see that they not only have their own cooling inside each one they actually have full cooling

20
00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:42.510
for the building because that's how much heat they produce.

21
00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:44.080
There's some waste.

22
00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:46.730
Of course there they are.

23
00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:49.920
There are our rigs.

24
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:53.170
So depending on what type of minuses this would be.

25
00:01:53.170 --> 00:01:59.550
These would be A-6 that use is probably a bit mines as these are going to be A-6 and we'll talk about

26
00:01:59.610 --> 00:02:02.540
more of that in coming to Charles.

27
00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.430
But just look at the scale of operation

28
00:02:10.690 --> 00:02:11.550
incredible.

29
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:15.610
When I saw this first I was always an oil.

30
00:02:15.730 --> 00:02:20.220
I did not imagine that this is what's what it's come to.

31
00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.130
And this is all to solve a cryptographic hash puzzle.

32
00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:29.490
It's probably the center of operations.

33
00:02:30.340 --> 00:02:45.220
Again some packaging fixing up one of their units or maintenance will put that installation incredible

34
00:02:45.610 --> 00:02:55.240
just to solve a cryptographic hash puzzle which as we discussed has no other reason apart from making

35
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:05.140
it hard for four miners to solve it so that we have the proof of work because look at what one theory

36
00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:05.910
create.

37
00:03:05.910 --> 00:03:08.920
And this is just one my this is lots of the lights

38
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:18.360
whole operation set up to do this thing while they actually even stay there.

39
00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.050
Yes that's for napping.

40
00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:22.870
OK.

41
00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:24.440
That's lives of the people.

42
00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:33.490
There are miners that reminds you or reminds me like my grandfather was a coal miner and really reminds

43
00:03:33.490 --> 00:03:37.840
me of like I can imagine his life would be something like that.

44
00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:41.050
But this is welcome to the 21st century mining right.

45
00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:47.950
Well not to say they are coal miners of course we still have coal miners but like coal technology has

46
00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:55.270
created mining created a whole industrial I don't know if it's in to can be called an industrial sector

47
00:03:55.270 --> 00:04:04.340
but a whole sector a whole shaping up to be an economical sector and just look economic economics just

48
00:04:05.650 --> 00:04:13.150
look at the size of these things like huge buildings buildings lots of people involved and they this

49
00:04:13.150 --> 00:04:14.110
is their life.

50
00:04:14.110 --> 00:04:16.300
This is what they do for work.

51
00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:23.320
So there we go that's an example of a bitcoin mine in China just something to ponder on.

52
00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:28.900
And there's definitely check out this article if you'd like to actually have a read through it or.

53
00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:33.880
Thank you very much to quaters for such a great message great photos.

54
00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:35.530
They they have lots of great articles.

55
00:04:35.530 --> 00:04:36.310
Check them out.

56
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:43.210
And also there's lots of good videos showing the actual what it's like inside the mind so you can actually

57
00:04:43.210 --> 00:04:49.360
hear the sound of the propellers you can hear everything working and see everything working so yeah

58
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:52.890
just something to ponder on.

59
00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:54.910
And I look forward to seeing your next step.

60
00:04:55.000 --> 00:04:57.150
Until then enjoy Bushin.
