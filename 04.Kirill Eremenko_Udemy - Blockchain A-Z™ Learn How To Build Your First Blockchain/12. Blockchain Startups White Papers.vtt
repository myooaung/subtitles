00:00:05.360 --> 00:00:06.060
Hello welcome back.

2
00:00:06.080 --> 00:00:07.190
Of course I'm watching.

3
00:00:07.190 --> 00:00:11.790
We've already discussed I suppose in quite a bit of detail and looked at a case study.

4
00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:18.560
And today we're going to talk about blocking startups and white papers for blocking projects because

5
00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:20.180
I think it's an important topic.

6
00:00:20.180 --> 00:00:26.000
There's a lot of hype right now around crypto currencies and block chain.

7
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:33.020
And while there is a lot of merit to some projects at the same time there are a lot of projects that

8
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:41.720
will probably fail and it is important to understand what kind of safeguards self understand what's

9
00:00:42.040 --> 00:00:44.740
a proper blockin project looks like.

10
00:00:44.750 --> 00:00:46.590
And if the idea is worthwhile.

11
00:00:46.750 --> 00:00:51.710
Now I wanted to put faces by saying that none of this is investment advice this is only educational

12
00:00:51.710 --> 00:00:52.160
purposes.

13
00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:56.830
We just look at someone examples and nothing more than that.

14
00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:01.010
In fact we're not even interested in the investment side of things we're interested in how these projects

15
00:01:01.010 --> 00:01:02.720
work and how blotching is.

16
00:01:02.750 --> 00:01:11.090
So here we are on coin market catacomb and you can see all of the different coins and tokens that exist

17
00:01:11.090 --> 00:01:16.290
right now and if you look there's like hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of them total markup right

18
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:18.210
now is like 322.

19
00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:19.100
Wow.

20
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:23.070
Billion dollars of this of this market.

21
00:01:24.150 --> 00:01:25.630
It's growing very fast.

22
00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.490
And so we're going to look at it as tokens.

23
00:01:28.660 --> 00:01:36.850
So even if you just look at the tokens these are the ones that you know they're meant to have.

24
00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:43.630
And in fact coins as well but like specifically tokens those are the ones that have the Suppose predominantly

25
00:01:43.630 --> 00:01:48.040
And those are the ones that are meant to actually have some idea behind them.

26
00:01:48.040 --> 00:01:51.540
So one of the ones that we're going to look at is power Ledger just now.

27
00:01:51.640 --> 00:01:54.350
But then there's lots and lots of different ones.

28
00:01:54.370 --> 00:02:00.490
And so as we discussed before somebody has kind of like an idea on how to change the world and make

29
00:02:00.490 --> 00:02:05.200
things better and they want to create this mini economy and they want to have their own Tolkin inside

30
00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.870
it to power they can.

31
00:02:07.190 --> 00:02:14.920
But all the time people just release these in order to kind of ride the wave of the hype that exists

32
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:22.780
hoping that people will just invest into their token just in order to later gain from the appreciating

33
00:02:22.780 --> 00:02:28.230
value of that token whereas the idea itself and the usage of took it might not have any meaning.

34
00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:32.450
So how do you tell how do you tell which ones are good and which ones are bad or not.

35
00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.220
We don't forget we're not talking about even investing into them.

36
00:02:35.410 --> 00:02:40.860
We're just trying to understand how do you tell how do you learn from these projects how can we find

37
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.920
the good projects.

38
00:02:42.010 --> 00:02:47.020
Because like so many of them hungry identify the good ones from the bad ones and if we want to do our

39
00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:52.690
own Blash and projects down bloated problems down the track How do we you know get some ideas learn

40
00:02:52.690 --> 00:02:55.750
from others from their successes and mistakes.

41
00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:02.170
But like really look at the valid ones rather than the ones who are just trying to ride the wave height.

42
00:03:02.530 --> 00:03:05.880
Well the way to look at it is to explore the white paper.

43
00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.610
So we're going to look at a couple of examples.

44
00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:10.680
So for instance here's a project called s.a.

45
00:03:11.020 --> 00:03:13.850
And again I don't know too much about this project.

46
00:03:14.170 --> 00:03:20.300
I'm not affiliated with a project in any way but it looks like something like an interesting idea.

47
00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:21.360
That's what it looks like to me.

48
00:03:21.370 --> 00:03:32.710
And the idea is to to use block chain to create to this distributed file hosting system just to create

49
00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:40.120
a secure distributed cloud hosting cloud storage platform storage platform and the way it works is probably

50
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.520
clouds up there were just like distributed storage platform because the way it works is like we all

51
00:03:45.520 --> 00:03:51.180
have spare gigabytes or terabytes on our hard drives.

52
00:03:51.310 --> 00:03:56.500
We always have like a little bit or a lot of extra space so why not use that why not rent out that space

53
00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:03.160
on your computer to two other people who need that storage who are currently using things like Dropbox

54
00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:04.660
or Google Drive.

55
00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:06.870
Why not have something that is distributed.

56
00:04:06.930 --> 00:04:11.620
You remember that like as we discussed the main concept of watch chain is one of the main concepts is

57
00:04:11.620 --> 00:04:19.120
to change the world from the hardware 3.0 will work and we'll talk about this actually in an upcoming

58
00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:19.810
trial.

59
00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:29.650
But the main idea is how to is to go from centralized storage a centralized servers to decentralized

60
00:04:29.660 --> 00:04:31.460
and so one of the things is storage.

61
00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:36.580
And so that's what they're doing is you can see like there's lots of different places where people are

62
00:04:36.580 --> 00:04:39.250
actually already part of the A block chain.

63
00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:45.730
And so the data isn't actually stored on the block itself that the data is stored in computers it's

64
00:04:45.730 --> 00:04:50.560
anonymised it's is is fragmented.

65
00:04:50.560 --> 00:04:56.780
So like there's virus protection obviously that they've probably thought through and what else.

66
00:04:56.910 --> 00:04:59.580
And there's like multiple copies and so on.

67
00:04:59.650 --> 00:05:05.830
And but the block chain allows people to control their data and to protect that there's nobody else

68
00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:08.430
can access it unless they have like the private key.

69
00:05:08.500 --> 00:05:14.600
And also it allows them to then later to put their data together see if their data is stored multiple

70
00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.720
hundred different views around the world.

71
00:05:16.960 --> 00:05:21.390
The whole chain facilitates that process of putting it back to you.

72
00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:23.280
So that's how I understand the project.

73
00:05:23.370 --> 00:05:25.410
And then there's lots more details to it.

74
00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:27.030
I think it's a lie.

75
00:05:27.030 --> 00:05:30.670
For me it's that's the overview I have all of it.

76
00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:35.950
But here you can find a bit more detail as you are at four seven provides the storage capacity.

77
00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:43.810
And so it hosts use storage on 13 terabytes and market caps is half a billion dollar project.

78
00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.140
And so how do you know if this idea is good and how do you find out more detail.

79
00:05:47.230 --> 00:05:52.870
While these projects what they usually have what they should have is called the white paper and you

80
00:05:52.870 --> 00:05:55.090
can find the white paper link here.

81
00:05:55.150 --> 00:06:04.040
So if you click white paper you will be redirected to and a description of how this project will work.

82
00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:13.390
And more importantly in terms of coins or tokens if they need a token for their project they should

83
00:06:13.390 --> 00:06:14.720
mention how it works here.

84
00:06:14.740 --> 00:06:21.480
Remember that small economy we're talking about in the example of the theme park well there.

85
00:06:21.610 --> 00:06:28.580
Mary explain how she those talking so same thing here they need to explain why only they need blocks

86
00:06:28.590 --> 00:06:30.930
in widening blushing How are they going to be that great.

87
00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:34.910
And then they need to explain also why do they need a token why.

88
00:06:34.970 --> 00:06:39.440
What is the purpose of that token of coin that they're going to have inside the plant or was it going

89
00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:41.220
to be doing so here.

90
00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:46.170
If you search for the words token or coins or have a look.

91
00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:51.510
So I searched for a token token doesn't come up OK.

92
00:06:51.520 --> 00:06:54.400
So the social coin you can see that it does come up.

93
00:06:54.410 --> 00:06:59.990
And then here says C-A will initially be implemented as an old coin a letter that I should carry to

94
00:06:59.990 --> 00:07:00.380
bitcoin.

95
00:07:00.380 --> 00:07:01.700
Why a two way peg.

96
00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.850
So then you can read a bit more into a holiday going to use this one or in this case is probably going

97
00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:09.590
to be for paying for the storage.

98
00:07:09.590 --> 00:07:09.810
Right.

99
00:07:09.830 --> 00:07:16.400
So people buy these coins and then they can pay each other for storage in these coins than they need.

100
00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.060
And that's how they're going to be using.

101
00:07:18.120 --> 00:07:24.100
The question here is economics are the primary currency of C as a C or coin.

102
00:07:24.230 --> 00:07:27.370
The supply of sequential is permanently and fresh supply.

103
00:07:27.400 --> 00:07:29.000
So it has to be very thought through.

104
00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:36.050
So here you can see that they've put in a lot of thinking into this into this project and how it will

105
00:07:36.050 --> 00:07:36.950
work.

106
00:07:36.950 --> 00:07:39.690
So that's one example.

107
00:07:39.690 --> 00:07:40.780
Let's have a look at another one.

108
00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.500
Now the example is quite famous called Power Ledger.

109
00:07:45.530 --> 00:07:47.960
So it was going to hold page.

110
00:07:48.230 --> 00:07:59.120
So power léger is a application of block chain which allows people to say sell their excess power to

111
00:07:59.120 --> 00:07:59.420
each other.

112
00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:07.840
So once you make electricity or life you gather solar energy you can then sell it to your neighbors.

113
00:08:07.850 --> 00:08:12.680
So if you're part of this network and generally the idea is that this approach will be cheaper than

114
00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:14.850
buying it from the grid.

115
00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:22.650
And I might be mistaken but as far as I remember it was there was an Australian start up see her there.

116
00:08:22.790 --> 00:08:30.380
So it's an Australian start up that because we have a lot of sun here and so people install solar panels

117
00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:34.750
on their roofs and they get electricity and sometimes enough to power your own home.

118
00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:36.870
But all the time is actually too much right.

119
00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:41.340
You need to you need to sell to the grid or something do something with it.

120
00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:49.070
And the idea they had is the one we use block chain to actually create this network like many economy

121
00:08:49.070 --> 00:08:56.360
again the concept is like a mini economy where people can sell this electricity to each other and that

122
00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.460
way they don't have to waste it they don't have to sell it back to the grid and also the sellers get

123
00:09:01.460 --> 00:09:06.530
a good price and the buyers get a good price because there's no middleman There's no you're not selling

124
00:09:06.530 --> 00:09:14.550
it back to the big company that operates the grid in the country that supplies electricity normally.

125
00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:15.670
And so there you go.

126
00:09:15.680 --> 00:09:17.270
That's that's a great idea.

127
00:09:17.270 --> 00:09:24.480
And again so what we're doing we take out the middleman with taking out the supply of electricity.

128
00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.160
The big corporation and therefore we're decentralizing something.

129
00:09:29.210 --> 00:09:32.930
No whenever we decentralizing something blocking might be a good idea.

130
00:09:32.930 --> 00:09:35.470
So they've come up with a way to do that.

131
00:09:35.540 --> 00:09:39.800
And so you can read more about it in their white paper so if you find the white paper here I think you

132
00:09:39.800 --> 00:09:45.530
go to papers and then you are white paper English takes a while to load several of that here.

133
00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:51.860
And so here you can see it's a very well thought through Project version of the white paper and so on.

134
00:09:51.890 --> 00:09:56.020
And then again so here you can just understand how it works.

135
00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:05.510
You know the the reason the reasons for it is on to like to find out how this whole this whole set up.

136
00:10:05.630 --> 00:10:10.950
But also you can find here they actually have an explanation.

137
00:10:11.030 --> 00:10:15.590
Internet technical power token jewel token ecosystem and so on.

138
00:10:15.590 --> 00:10:23.050
So if you go to page 20 to go to page 22 where is that.

139
00:10:23.170 --> 00:10:23.630
OK.

140
00:10:23.650 --> 00:10:30.750
So somewhere here they start talking about the power token will serve as a few of the power of their

141
00:10:30.740 --> 00:10:34.160
journey because this partner can will help facilitate low cost and so on.

142
00:10:34.270 --> 00:10:44.160
And if it was sparks as I think is is quarks there the Polish platform is across this transpired and

143
00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:51.550
inter operator operable energy trading platform that supports an ever expanding suite of energy applications

144
00:10:51.910 --> 00:10:57.940
with an exchangeable frictionless energy trading tokens parks and so then they explain why the need

145
00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.230
sparks and so on and how is going to work.

146
00:11:00.340 --> 00:11:05.110
Why exactly do they need it tokens so in this case it makes sense for them to show token because it's

147
00:11:05.110 --> 00:11:07.380
going to be a means of exchange about.

148
00:11:07.990 --> 00:11:11.370
So there's another project quite quite a famous one.

149
00:11:11.950 --> 00:11:14.710
And finally here's a problem you don't want to get on.

150
00:11:14.710 --> 00:11:20.020
Finally as we get a few more but like an interesting one I want to show you is called provenance and

151
00:11:20.170 --> 00:11:25.540
this is a project that uses the block chain in order to track products where they come from.

152
00:11:25.540 --> 00:11:33.340
So the best way to show it is if you go to case studies you'll see that live examples like you know

153
00:11:33.370 --> 00:11:39.250
they you can use provenance to see where the fish came from that you are about to eat or the meat or

154
00:11:39.690 --> 00:11:47.620
you know like other foods you know as it is is that through Ferriz through labor or is it not through

155
00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:49.030
fair labor and so on.

156
00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:53.770
You know where it is where is this wall coming from or is where was it created or was it created in

157
00:11:53.770 --> 00:12:02.080
a shop this shirred was it created in a sweatshop or was it created in a proper place with good conditions

158
00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:03.190
for the workers and so on.

159
00:12:03.190 --> 00:12:04.600
Where does your coffee come from.

160
00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:12.430
Does it come from a come from Ethiopia or does it come from you know your neighbor's backyard.

161
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:18.940
So it helps trace products throughout their journey through the world.

162
00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:26.470
Very very interesting project and indeed again because it's something that's de-centralized something

163
00:12:26.470 --> 00:12:32.530
that you want to take out the middleman you don't want just one company or several organizations tracking

164
00:12:32.530 --> 00:12:36.910
this you want this to be available to everybody you want this life here it's not just more not as much

165
00:12:36.910 --> 00:12:41.250
about decentralizing like as taking out the middleman it's more about decentralizing as in making it

166
00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.580
available to everybody.

167
00:12:42.580 --> 00:12:48.160
So transparency is one of the advantage of watching and transparency so one increased transparency so

168
00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:49.530
they're using blotching.

169
00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:56.180
They've been thinking about this project is that when I read their white paper where is this why.

170
00:12:56.840 --> 00:13:00.580
I think it goes to technology here.

171
00:13:00.610 --> 00:13:07.270
If you if I if you look at the White Paper here and read a white paper it was pretty clear.

172
00:13:07.570 --> 00:13:12.660
If you read the white paper I couldn't find any mention of one or token.

173
00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.700
And so that's very interesting so that even though they're using block chain they aren't actually doing

174
00:13:18.700 --> 00:13:26.620
an ICR IPO because maybe they just don't need to use Hoynes or tokens in there they don't need some

175
00:13:26.620 --> 00:13:32.300
money to fund this is just a project that nobody to actually pay each other for things.

176
00:13:32.410 --> 00:13:39.790
It's just like a way that to organize this situation and like I might be wrong they might have been

177
00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.550
talking or coin.

178
00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:46.400
But the point is that sometimes projects even though they use blocks and they might not need to have

179
00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:46.510
it.

180
00:13:46.510 --> 00:13:53.640
I see no they don't need that internal economy to to create.

181
00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.590
So to somehow exchange value between participants and there are examples like that as well.

182
00:13:59.590 --> 00:14:06.370
So that's also to keep something to keep in mind not all blocking projects have to have NYCO and finally

183
00:14:06.640 --> 00:14:07.760
just some fun stuff too.

184
00:14:07.780 --> 00:14:16.450
And Kodak if you've heard of coater come the photographer the company that went bankrupt a couple of

185
00:14:16.450 --> 00:14:21.580
years ago is still around is still going through the bankruptcy proceedings as far as I understand.

186
00:14:21.730 --> 00:14:26.120
And they announced their own cryptocurrency token or ICAO.

187
00:14:26.140 --> 00:14:34.280
And yeah so that's one of those examples when that's there's just like on the hype tried and tried to

188
00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:38.680
hype way of as you can see the market price went right up as soon as that happened like 120 percent

189
00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:39.500
up.

190
00:14:39.910 --> 00:14:42.350
But if you look at it now it's like going back down.

191
00:14:42.550 --> 00:14:48.670
And if you do some additional reading and research you'll see that a lot like those action investigations

192
00:14:48.790 --> 00:14:51.880
by a company and they found that it's a worthless idea.

193
00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:54.850
And you know it still hasn't gone ahead.

194
00:14:54.850 --> 00:14:57.820
They're really driving along with this ICL and so on.

195
00:14:58.090 --> 00:15:05.610
And it just shows examples of even a large previously large behemoth company they still have.

196
00:15:05.620 --> 00:15:13.870
She likes the 7000 or 6000 CLI's even to those that were previously huge company like now is trying

197
00:15:13.870 --> 00:15:14.200
to do it.

198
00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.780
So just to ride the hype wave so be careful of that.

199
00:15:16.990 --> 00:15:23.150
And if you're just going to throw money away I found this really interesting when it's a close still.

200
00:15:23.170 --> 00:15:29.140
But this person actually just funny is called the useless mysterium token the world's first 100 percent

201
00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:29.940
honest theory.

202
00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.610
Mostly.

203
00:15:30.970 --> 00:15:35.620
It's kind of like a parody on CEOs as so many people doing I suppose of you know claiming that they

204
00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:40.260
have a cool project behind it just to raise money and then this probably isn't going to go anywhere.

205
00:15:40.300 --> 00:15:47.290
While this IPO is actually there they're saying upfront that they're not going to do anything of that

206
00:15:47.310 --> 00:15:50.980
we're just going to spend that they're going to waste it on themselves.

207
00:15:51.250 --> 00:15:55.870
Let's go to Sarah started though I suppose they get hyped up for weeks and then they launch and clog

208
00:15:55.870 --> 00:16:05.020
up with your network for days and Sorenson's on so here they explain some random person on the Internet

209
00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:10.070
and you're going to give some money and some random person on the Internet money and they're going to

210
00:16:10.070 --> 00:16:11.940
take it and buy stuff with it.

211
00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:15.920
And so this project actually raise a lot of money.

212
00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:18.020
Hundred fifty eight thousand dollars.

213
00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.450
You can read a bit more about it on Reddit and stuff like that like.

214
00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:23.100
Yeah.

215
00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:27.130
So even people will invest even into things like that just for fun.

216
00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:33.170
So yeah be careful out there is lots of stuff like this and again this is not about investments it's

217
00:16:33.170 --> 00:16:34.900
more about projects.

218
00:16:34.910 --> 00:16:38.600
You know these interesting projects out that I can give you ideas probably won't get any ideas from

219
00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:46.710
this but you can get some interesting ideas from how provenance uses blotching how Paul Leger's is approaching

220
00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:53.450
Hollis's as abortion and there are projects that you can explore and just focus on reading white papers

221
00:16:53.480 --> 00:16:57.400
because that's where all the technical details are contained or should contain.

222
00:16:57.770 --> 00:17:01.770
On that note I hope you enjoy today sectorial and I look forward See you next time.

223
00:17:01.820 --> 00:17:03.740
Until then deriv. auctions.
