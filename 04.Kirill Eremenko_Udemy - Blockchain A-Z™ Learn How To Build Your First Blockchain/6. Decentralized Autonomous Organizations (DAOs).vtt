00:00:05.010 --> 00:00:06.000
Hello and welcome back.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:06.900
Of course I'm lucky.

3
00:00:06.990 --> 00:00:12.600
And today we're talking about decentralized autonomous organizations or Daos for short.

4
00:00:12.690 --> 00:00:19.740
So if you've been in the world of the theorem kind of like exploring the world of fear you might have

5
00:00:19.740 --> 00:00:20.770
come across this term.

6
00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:24.270
So do not confuse it with the Dow.

7
00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:29.760
The Dow is something we'll discuss in and coming to Turrell probably the next one.

8
00:00:29.850 --> 00:00:33.950
This is that's a specific Dow these general dollars.

9
00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:36.970
And so what are de-centralized antonymous three positions.

10
00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:41.100
Well let's start al-Shehri question by asking another question.

11
00:00:41.310 --> 00:00:47.070
What are organizations these days and here's an example.

12
00:00:47.340 --> 00:00:54.420
If you set aside all of the assets of the organization and all of the actual work they do whether it's

13
00:00:54.420 --> 00:01:01.300
like physical labor like drilling holes in the ground or laying cables or building buildings or you

14
00:01:01.490 --> 00:01:05.170
lower and or it could be creative work design work and so on.

15
00:01:05.220 --> 00:01:09.870
If you put those things aside inside the organization what runs the organization.

16
00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:15.090
That's the question we're asking which is usually a hierarchical structure where you have Director directors

17
00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:21.030
managers more managers more managers than employees and all these people do certain things to make the

18
00:01:21.030 --> 00:01:22.130
company operate.

19
00:01:22.380 --> 00:01:25.070
And the question is what exactly did they do.

20
00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:26.590
What do these people do.

21
00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:35.340
Well these people follow protocols they follow certain procedures in order to make this company operate.

22
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.780
For example if an invoice comes in you need to check these things off if they check off.

23
00:01:40.800 --> 00:01:46.400
Then you need to pay the invoice or you need to raise the purchase order purchase order that you know

24
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:50.060
you pay the invoice or if you need to invoice somebody else.

25
00:01:50.130 --> 00:01:50.940
How does it work.

26
00:01:51.010 --> 00:01:51.470
That's right.

27
00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:56.580
If she comes in then you raise the purchase order then you pay in with something I haven't done that

28
00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:57.960
in a while.

29
00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:03.540
And so you know like checking things out for example the other example like where if it's the end of

30
00:02:03.540 --> 00:02:11.370
the month pay like check the number of employees check their bank accounts pay pay pay money to their

31
00:02:11.370 --> 00:02:14.580
bank accounts you know that's that's all done by humans.

32
00:02:14.580 --> 00:02:17.960
Most of the time this was for other examples.

33
00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:23.760
There's just financial examples but there's operational examples and lots of things that are done in

34
00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:27.740
a recession that are just procedures that need to be followed.

35
00:02:27.780 --> 00:02:32.000
This of course is of course room for strategy and growth of the organization.

36
00:02:32.010 --> 00:02:40.560
And like other important business decisions what's at the core running of an organization is like like

37
00:02:40.560 --> 00:02:46.080
if there's a car driving or somebody steering it and they're deciding where to go left and right and

38
00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.750
which way but the car has to run.

39
00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:55.550
And so there's lots of little parts inside the car that are doing their thing that make the car work.

40
00:02:55.560 --> 00:02:57.280
Same thing in organization.

41
00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:03.570
Any organization that has work that needs to be done there are just procedures and protocols and so

42
00:03:03.690 --> 00:03:06.560
the question is how do these people know the procedures are.

43
00:03:06.670 --> 00:03:11.850
Well they are given the procedures and protocols and very often they're even written out in their contract

44
00:03:11.850 --> 00:03:17.400
exactly what they need to be doing so the contract specifies their protocols or procedures of what type

45
00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.640
of work you're doing.

46
00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:27.360
So we take that idea further and we say well if we really put our mind to it then we can create an organization

47
00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.940
where people don't have to be doing this.

48
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:33.850
This can all be done automatically This can all be done by computers.

49
00:03:34.050 --> 00:03:41.460
And that brings in the notion of smart contracts what if you replace all these people who smart contracts

50
00:03:41.700 --> 00:03:50.220
which are which their design is to like have conditions if something happens do this if this happens

51
00:03:50.250 --> 00:03:51.030
that it's on.

52
00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:55.950
So if you ride out all those verticals and then call them because we as we discussed we have a complete

53
00:03:55.950 --> 00:03:56.920
broken language.

54
00:03:56.970 --> 00:04:02.610
You can code and you like logic into it if you code all those things into smart contracts.

55
00:04:02.610 --> 00:04:05.550
All of a sudden you have an organization that's running itself.

56
00:04:05.850 --> 00:04:08.790
And that's what Dows are all about.

57
00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:14.100
I know this might sound quite far fetched but let's have a little look at a couple of examples to make

58
00:04:14.100 --> 00:04:17.420
this concept more relatable.

59
00:04:17.520 --> 00:04:24.150
So we're going to look at two examples so first one is a company or decentralized autonomous organization

60
00:04:24.420 --> 00:04:28.440
that does air ride service like writers.

61
00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:28.730
Right.

62
00:04:28.740 --> 00:04:33.390
So it's not actually right sharing because the cars are driving themselves autonomously.

63
00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:38.740
Even so even a car can be one of us as we've seen from the news lately.

64
00:04:38.790 --> 00:04:45.240
So cars are driving themselves and and the realization is driving itself right is running itself.

65
00:04:45.240 --> 00:04:52.800
So a person is waiting for a car they want to go from their house to their work a car appears person

66
00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:58.170
gets in the car car drives them all the way to work car drops them off at work.

67
00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:04.470
There's another person waiting now they need to go pick up this person or that so they need to go somewhere

68
00:05:04.470 --> 00:05:10.740
else the car or the car and to go pick up another person and the car for itself because of the smart

69
00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:15.120
contracts because of the programming that's invested in this organization.

70
00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:18.900
It can decide for itself that it will pay stubs by the petrol station.

71
00:05:19.110 --> 00:05:24.510
Then there is a smart contract that governs how it interacts with the petrol station at the petrol station

72
00:05:24.510 --> 00:05:30.060
itself can have a smart contract the car checks off on that smart contract the petrol station checks

73
00:05:30.170 --> 00:05:36.150
in this far country or a car is an exchange of petrol for whatever currency the petrol station accepts

74
00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:38.160
and then the car drives on.

75
00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:45.050
So this whole process doesn't need a human involved it even started from the Hasn't doesn't to be a

76
00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:50.940
driver anymore or soon in the near future they will need to be a driver to the whole point of the car

77
00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:53.110
and decide for itself when to get petrol.

78
00:05:53.110 --> 00:05:59.870
The car the computer in the organization or on the blocks and it's all happening on the block and the

79
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:07.670
computer on the block chain can decide which users are closest and which users it needs to go pick up

80
00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:08.690
and things like that.

81
00:06:08.690 --> 00:06:14.570
So at the end of the day you really don't need much human intervention in running an organisation like

82
00:06:14.570 --> 00:06:15.260
this.

83
00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:21.700
And moreover if this organisation is designed and the bloodshed.

84
00:06:22.190 --> 00:06:29.340
So it's not like a centralized organization it's decentralized so decentralized meaning that it's a

85
00:06:29.350 --> 00:06:35.240
law like it it doesn't belong to all of the servers don't belong to one specific company.

86
00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:42.740
So even if it was followed by several people that started it off but because it's complete decentralized

87
00:06:42.740 --> 00:06:45.370
and these contracts are written out on the block chain.

88
00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:53.420
The key thing here to understand is that even if that company itself like fades or fails or like those

89
00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:55.530
people no longer interested in running it.

90
00:06:55.820 --> 00:06:57.690
The context is it exists.

91
00:06:57.740 --> 00:07:02.120
Smart contracts still exist on the block chain and the organization is going to keep running itself

92
00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:08.900
so it doesn't need that human Drage doesn't need a board of directors it doesn't need managers It doesn't

93
00:07:08.900 --> 00:07:13.200
need employees it just all happens on its own on the block.

94
00:07:13.550 --> 00:07:17.340
That's the concept of darf And so let's have a look at a different example.

95
00:07:17.480 --> 00:07:25.180
So here we've got an organization which provides a computational service from the cloud to its customers.

96
00:07:25.190 --> 00:07:31.580
It could be something like a proprietary machine learning algorithm to predict certain things about

97
00:07:31.610 --> 00:07:37.900
how you know like marketing is going to succeed or fail or things like that.

98
00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:42.330
And so the question is why would it be on the cloud if you read the block chain.

99
00:07:42.350 --> 00:07:43.760
Well good point.

100
00:07:43.790 --> 00:07:47.090
Fair point but let's let's stick with this example.

101
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:54.440
One of your colleagues example I really liked it so it's it doesn't have necessarily to do with the

102
00:07:54.440 --> 00:08:00.770
Bauchi but will oh will say that the smart contracts and everything that's running this organization

103
00:08:00.830 --> 00:08:02.230
is on the block chain.

104
00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:07.850
Just for some reason it needs to operate from the cloud for whatever reason just for argument sake.

105
00:08:08.180 --> 00:08:13.100
And so what it will do is it will grow this company it will provide the service it will grow and then

106
00:08:13.100 --> 00:08:20.300
it will decide for itself that it's time to open another cloud service like another computing service

107
00:08:20.360 --> 00:08:28.430
and open another cloud account somewhere and or go and find the cloud open accounts and it will expand

108
00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:28.960
on its own.

109
00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.690
Q A core key notion here is a organization like that could even expand and grow on its own when its

110
00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:40.340
revenue hits a certain threshold because of the logic coded into the smart contracts.

111
00:08:40.400 --> 00:08:45.540
It understands that it's time to expand it services it could go and expand to other cloud.

112
00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:53.750
And then after a while like it might run out of call services that are pre coded into it so it might

113
00:08:53.750 --> 00:08:59.870
have some logic coded on how to you know go to Google and find more cloud services and expand there

114
00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:00.770
as well.

115
00:09:00.770 --> 00:09:03.490
So it's a very basic example.

116
00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:10.790
And in fact the taluk doesn't even if he gives this example in a different way he calls this and antonymous

117
00:09:10.820 --> 00:09:15.660
agent rather than a decentralized autonomous or ization.

118
00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:20.900
Either way it illustrates the point that we're logic.

119
00:09:21.040 --> 00:09:29.980
We can code things that will run themselves and run on their own and with the power of change we can

120
00:09:29.980 --> 00:09:36.520
make them decentralized meaning that they don't even that logic doesn't have to live in an in a silo

121
00:09:36.940 --> 00:09:41.000
over an organization it can live on the on the on the chain.

122
00:09:41.050 --> 00:09:51.310
And therefore if this organization is profitable and can grow even if something like Even if the people

123
00:09:51.310 --> 00:09:56.740
who started it are no longer interested in it or running it or anything that it can survive on its own

124
00:09:56.830 --> 00:09:59.870
it can just keep running and keep serving the community.

125
00:09:59.890 --> 00:10:07.550
That's the whole notion behind Daos and you should like to learn more I would highly highly highly recommend

126
00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:14.340
this article is a blog written by Vitalii called Daos daks DA's and more on incomplete terminology guide

127
00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:22.620
where he talks in great depth about things like autonomous agents decentralized applications decentralized

128
00:10:22.620 --> 00:10:28.740
organization decentralized autonomous organizations dolls and decentralized autonomous corporations.

129
00:10:28.830 --> 00:10:33.310
And he gives his thoughts on the differentiation between all those.

130
00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:38.280
And what I really like about the article is he's got lots of examples there including that cloud example

131
00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.400
that we just went through.

132
00:10:39.720 --> 00:10:42.600
And also it's roots in very simple language.

133
00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:44.610
So it's on the therian blog.

134
00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:49.590
And even though it's quite old 2014 it's still very relevant still a great read.

135
00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.710
We'll link this in in their course notes.

136
00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:56.750
And again if you interested in learning more about dolls and how these things work.

137
00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.210
Highly recommend checking it out.

138
00:10:59.220 --> 00:11:05.670
It will make a lot of things like that give you a lot of knowledge on on these topics.

139
00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:10.380
And on that thought hoping today senatorial all look forward to seeing you back here next time.

140
00:11:10.380 --> 00:11:12.300
And until then in gybe Lachance.
