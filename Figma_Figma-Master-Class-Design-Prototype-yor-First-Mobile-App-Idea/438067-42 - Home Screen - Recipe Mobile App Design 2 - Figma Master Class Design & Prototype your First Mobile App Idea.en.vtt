00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.940
in this lesson.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:10.950
We're going to create the bottom navigation which is going to be at the bottom off this app

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:16.350
here at this or here because we want tohave navigation first.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:18.680
Then we're going to create the content inside it.

00:00:18.680 --> 00:00:20.970
So to do that,

00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:23.150
we're going to use a rectangle over here.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.020
This is going to be a rectangle for the navigation and it is going to be your white.

00:00:30.020 --> 00:00:35.240
Now you can see why I'm using white because it will have some contrast on this background.

00:00:35.240 --> 00:00:37.000
This background is not pure white.

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.710
It has greenish color and finish you in it.

00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:43.540
So once we have this,

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.760
we're going to use a fax over here to have some trap drop shadow.

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:50.780
But this time the drop shadow will be on the opposite side.

00:00:50.780 --> 00:00:52.550
So we're going to use minus for,

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.620
like,

00:00:53.620 --> 00:01:00.110
this blood is going to be six like this and we're going to use 10% something like this very

00:01:00.110 --> 00:01:00.950
subtle shadow.

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:04.990
And you can also have a shadow off the same color.

00:01:04.990 --> 00:01:07.050
Which is going to be this.

00:01:07.050 --> 00:01:16.770
Let's use this background color and we're going to amplify it like this over here.

00:01:16.770 --> 00:01:19.100
So this is the background color were using.

00:01:19.100 --> 00:01:20.900
And this is,

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:21.650
um,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:23.090
100%.

00:01:23.090 --> 00:01:24.750
So you're going to use 15%.

00:01:24.750 --> 00:01:29.350
Let's use 20% like this.

00:01:29.350 --> 00:01:31.850
Next zoom in.

00:01:31.850 --> 00:01:34.490
And,

00:01:34.490 --> 00:01:35.050
uh,

00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:36.580
where are these?

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.150
Actually,

00:01:37.150 --> 00:01:41.950
this is going to be your hair.

00:01:41.950 --> 00:01:44.050
Okay,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:48.280
so here is our bottom navigation.

00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:50.640
Zoom out in Hyde.

00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:53.000
The Kruger's like this.

00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.890
So this is going to be our bottom navigation.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.940
It is actually 60 pics of that should be 60 pixels.

00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:01.650
That is why it was happening.

00:02:01.650 --> 00:02:06.100
So shift our No,

00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:06.780
actually,

00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:10.450
this waas correct.

00:02:10.450 --> 00:02:13.500
Now it is looking read.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:13.980
Anyhow,

00:02:13.980 --> 00:02:16.500
I'm very big Zil Perfect.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.230
So I try to be as perfect as I can.

00:02:19.230 --> 00:02:20.790
Now we're going to grab,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:23.650
and this is going to be our navigation PG,

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.000
so it will be static.

00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:29.790
So we're going to drag and drop all our icons in their states.

00:02:29.790 --> 00:02:37.880
So this is going to be our house on me and icon for the first navigation item home hopes.

00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:40.550
So we have a bigger one over here.

00:02:40.550 --> 00:02:43.070
This is 20 by 21.

00:02:43.070 --> 00:02:45.550
This is 28 by 30.

00:02:45.550 --> 00:02:49.950
So we're going to use 21 by 20.

00:02:49.950 --> 00:03:07.460
So excuse 21 hair so you can see or hear zoom in because we want to be already perfect over

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:07.880
here.

00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:14.900
This is our empty line home.

00:03:14.900 --> 00:03:15.860
Normal.

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:21.750
And this is going to be home active like this.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.580
So do you feel the difference?

00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:28.140
Anything moving around?

00:03:28.140 --> 00:03:28.650
No.

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:30.110
So this is perfect.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:34.950
So we are going to go to this vector and change the stroke color.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:41.540
Tow this green because this is going to be our normal color.

00:03:41.540 --> 00:03:43.200
And this is going to be our active,

00:03:43.200 --> 00:03:45.810
so active color will be actually discovered.

00:03:45.810 --> 00:03:47.090
This means collapse.

00:03:47.090 --> 00:03:49.390
Let's add discolor toe over styles too.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:52.040
So this is our primary cream.

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:54.920
This is our primary green.

00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:56.150
If you want to arrange them,

00:03:56.150 --> 00:03:57.400
you're gonna reach them.

00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.250
Let me show you.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:00.480
But right now it's OK.

00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:02.230
So click outside over here.

00:04:02.230 --> 00:04:06.950
Primary being Let's move it up like this.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:11.650
And medium green and great green gray,

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:12.850
white Facebook,

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.510
Dark green will be at the top like this.

00:04:15.510 --> 00:04:16.650
This is looking better.

00:04:16.650 --> 00:04:20.080
And now I'm going to select my art board.

00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:23.430
This is going to be my home active,

00:04:23.430 --> 00:04:26.450
and I'm going to use this color.

00:04:26.450 --> 00:04:28.430
Yeah,

00:04:28.430 --> 00:04:31.740
so right now I'm in this stage,

00:04:31.740 --> 00:04:33.760
I'm going to hide the normal state.

00:04:33.760 --> 00:04:39.440
This is going to be home active and we're going to move both off them inside.

00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:45.800
Now we're going to align it in the middle off this over here,

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:49.900
and we're going to do the same for all the other icons.

00:04:49.900 --> 00:04:54.070
You can get the idea that inside home we have to stairs home,

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:55.340
active home normal.

00:04:55.340 --> 00:04:58.060
They must be off the same size.

00:04:58.060 --> 00:05:00.730
So if you hide or show one and the other one,

00:05:00.730 --> 00:05:06.050
they must not flicker or change size or shape or their position.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:08.700
So this is actually the mean.

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.160
You can see the point northward here.

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.990
So once we have home over here,

00:05:12.990 --> 00:05:13.650
I'm going toe,

00:05:13.650 --> 00:05:18.870
speed it up and I'm going to bring other two icons over here Quickly.

00:05:18.870 --> 00:05:18.870
-

00:05:18.870 --> 00:06:04.950
Now

00:06:04.950 --> 00:06:06.150
we're going to align these.

00:06:06.150 --> 00:06:11.150
So we have these three navigation items and let's align these.

00:06:11.150 --> 00:06:13.600
So first,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.350
we're going to select all of them.

00:06:15.350 --> 00:06:20.800
I am holding controller Command key,

00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:23.900
and we're going to use this tidy up.

00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:25.470
So this is looking good.

00:06:25.470 --> 00:06:27.950
So it just arrange this one in the middle,

00:06:27.950 --> 00:06:30.950
and now we're going to change the stairs.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:33.810
So this settings inactive stairs so active,

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:35.500
we're going to hide like this.

00:06:35.500 --> 00:06:37.650
So we have three stairs over here.

00:06:37.650 --> 00:06:38.520
Now,

00:06:38.520 --> 00:06:41.190
if you want to have some mawr,

00:06:41.190 --> 00:06:42.360
um,

00:06:42.360 --> 00:06:44.010
relisting approach,

00:06:44.010 --> 00:06:51.470
you can also use this opacity over here so we can have something like 80% on 90% like this

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:51.470
.

00:06:51.470 --> 00:06:54.760
And we can also have something over here like this.

00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.550
90% on this is looking a bit smaller.

00:06:58.550 --> 00:07:05.280
So this home we are going to increase its size selects use,

00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:07.650
shift like this.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.050
This is looking much better,

00:07:10.050 --> 00:07:14.280
because thes I cause we're looking bigger.

00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:16.450
And this one was looking a bit smaller.

00:07:16.450 --> 00:07:21.150
So now let's try toe align them like this.

00:07:21.150 --> 00:07:23.720
So Oops.

00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:25.670
So let's align them at the bottom.

00:07:25.670 --> 00:07:27.250
That's these are looking good,

00:07:27.250 --> 00:07:28.720
uh,

00:07:28.720 --> 00:07:30.360
19 at the top.

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.550
So we're going to have 18 and 18.

00:07:32.550 --> 00:07:36.380
Let's move them a bit more up like this.

00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:39.650
So this is looking great.

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:43.450
Let's keep 13.

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.730
Okay,

00:07:44.730 --> 00:07:47.970
so our navigation menu at the bottom is complete.

00:07:47.970 --> 00:07:54.140
We can You can see that we have one inactive state and we have one active states.

00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.690
Active state is a bright green,

00:07:56.690 --> 00:07:58.090
very sharp,

00:07:58.090 --> 00:08:01.560
greenish blue and inactive is a bit dull green,

00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:03.340
which is in our color scheme.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:06.590
It is called medium green color.

00:08:06.590 --> 00:08:09.760
So you can also added the stroke weight off your s,

00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:11.260
which is icons like this.

00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:14.390
If you want to have a very slim icon,

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.060
icons like that,

00:08:16.060 --> 00:08:16.750
for example,

00:08:16.750 --> 00:08:19.050
I want to have one pixel.

00:08:19.050 --> 00:08:20.020
But like that,

00:08:20.020 --> 00:08:21.550
or maybe 1.5,

00:08:21.550 --> 00:08:23.000
this is looking better.

00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.650
1.5 looks good.

00:08:24.650 --> 00:08:28.270
Um,

00:08:28.270 --> 00:08:32.200
so I think our bottom navigation is complete.

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:35.570
We can easily change it and order it.

00:08:35.570 --> 00:08:40.150
And one more thing is that you can also cleared Ah,

00:08:40.150 --> 00:08:42.400
a component for this one.

00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:42.800
So,

00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:47.150
command G and this is our bottom.

00:08:47.150 --> 00:08:48.670
I have.

00:08:48.670 --> 00:08:50.520
And,

00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:53.220
um that's right.

00:08:53.220 --> 00:08:54.970
Click and create component.

00:08:54.970 --> 00:09:01.760
There are many ways you can create a component and we are going to replicate it and control

00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:05.430
and command E and control Command X to copy this one,

00:09:05.430 --> 00:09:10.550
and we're going to move it in this frame.

00:09:10.550 --> 00:09:11.690
So also,

00:09:11.690 --> 00:09:14.970
you can change the frame color background to be like,

00:09:14.970 --> 00:09:15.450
Oops.

00:09:15.450 --> 00:09:18.110
So we are going to change the frame,

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:18.370
color,

00:09:18.370 --> 00:09:19.370
background,

00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:23.650
feel color to be something like great.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:27.400
So we can easily see other components on top off it.

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:33.350
So this is our you can say mean Ah,

00:09:33.350 --> 00:09:35.350
you can say navigations.

00:09:35.350 --> 00:09:39.190
Our mean items that are going to be present on every screen,

00:09:39.190 --> 00:09:40.210
like such bar,

00:09:40.210 --> 00:09:43.210
our logo are back a row,

00:09:43.210 --> 00:09:45.080
going back to the screen,

00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:46.310
and then we have this one.

00:09:46.310 --> 00:09:47.860
So now in the next lesson,

00:09:47.860 --> 00:09:49.610
we're going to create the middle content,

00:09:49.610 --> 00:09:51.860
the images and all that stuff,

00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:53.790
so let's move on to the next listen.
