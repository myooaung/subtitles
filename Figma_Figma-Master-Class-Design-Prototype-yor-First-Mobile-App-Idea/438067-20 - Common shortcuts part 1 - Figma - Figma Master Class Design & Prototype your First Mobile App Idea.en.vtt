00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.100
in this video,

00:00:06.100 --> 00:00:08.250
we're going to learn some of the commonly used fig,

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:09.140
my short guards.

00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.780
And in this lesson,

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:16.150
I'm going to show you how you can ban or zoom around in your feet my interface hide and

00:00:16.150 --> 00:00:17.520
show some of the controls.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.050
So let's get started.

00:00:19.050 --> 00:00:20.800
So first we're going toe.

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:21.850
Look at Penn.

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:28.200
So if you can press your space bar and hold it and you will see this hand and you can

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:34.620
easily ban around or move this your frame around wherever you want toe,

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.090
this is first shortcut.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:36.550
Now,

00:00:36.550 --> 00:00:38.620
the 2nd 1 is about zoom levels.

00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:43.150
So you can see here you can see it is set to zoom level or 50%.

00:00:43.150 --> 00:00:45.370
And he was select this frame.

00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:52.370
If you want to zoom toe 100% you are going to press zero so pressing zero so you can see

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:57.580
this is the actual frame size off the frame are art board I'm using.

00:00:57.580 --> 00:01:04.660
Now you can also zoom toe fit so you can press one so you can see now it has been zoomed

00:01:04.660 --> 00:01:10.660
toe fit and is 71% now and also you can press one or nine.

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:16.500
So one is easier to remember zero for 100% 1 is for zoom toe fit,

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.530
and two is for zoom to selection.

00:01:19.530 --> 00:01:20.160
So,

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:20.870
for example,

00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:21.900
if I have,

00:01:21.900 --> 00:01:30.200
let's zoom out first for and you can zoom out by using command or control plus minus key.

00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:33.340
So you have toe hold your control key,

00:01:33.340 --> 00:01:35.030
and along with that,

00:01:35.030 --> 00:01:41.360
you have to press minus minus was Omar Plus we'll zoom in so this is very easy.

00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:42.450
Plus,

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:48.330
so I'm just holding my control or command key on a Mac if you're on a Mac command and if

00:01:48.330 --> 00:01:53.640
you are on a windows than control key minus and plus.

00:01:53.640 --> 00:02:02.550
So let's suppose that I waas designing in this zoom level and I want to zoom into this

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:03.350
Hello there.

00:02:03.350 --> 00:02:04.690
So,

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:04.990
no,

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.340
I'm going to select this object first,

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:09.810
So I'm going to drag and slacked and press,

00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:10.240
too,

00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.920
so you can see now it is in the focus.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:20.250
So if you want to go back or you have to zoom toe 100% or do you want to zoom to fit press

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:20.680
one.

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:26.450
So this is a great way off zooming in and out when you are designing.

00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:28.010
Most of the time When you are designing,

00:02:28.010 --> 00:02:31.150
you have to zoom in and zoom out a lot of times.

00:02:31.150 --> 00:02:33.880
So these shortcuts are going to help you out.

00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:34.800
Now,

00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.330
whenever you were designing you,

00:02:36.330 --> 00:02:42.450
you sometimes need your rulers to draw some of the guidelines to support your design or you

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:44.180
have to align few things.

00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.330
So in fig ma,

00:02:46.330 --> 00:02:51.550
you have to enable your rulers first so you can see at the top over here or on the left.

00:02:51.550 --> 00:02:53.190
We have normal this.

00:02:53.190 --> 00:03:00.570
So we're going to breath shift and are now You can see we have rulers on the top and on the

00:03:00.570 --> 00:03:01.000
left.

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.620
So if you want Oh,

00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.460
if you don't remember this shortcut,

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:08.890
you can go over here on this menu and here we have shift plus R.

00:03:08.890 --> 00:03:11.450
So you can enable it over here too.

00:03:11.450 --> 00:03:13.420
So once you have enable it,

00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.910
you can drag guidelines over here like this.

00:03:15.910 --> 00:03:17.890
They're going to stab two different objects.

00:03:17.890 --> 00:03:18.800
For example,

00:03:18.800 --> 00:03:19.750
I have this one.

00:03:19.750 --> 00:03:24.550
I am going to drag and drop my guidelines like this.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.270
So this is another shortcut.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.580
Shift are and you are going toe enable your rulers.

00:03:30.580 --> 00:03:34.870
Now I have hidden my ruler and you can see my guidelines have also disappeared.

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.020
Now,

00:03:36.020 --> 00:03:40.860
if you want to show your design to someone and you don't want to show them this design

00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:45.500
section over here this panel over here are also the layers panel on the left.

00:03:45.500 --> 00:03:54.040
You can press and hold your control or command key along with your back slash So control

00:03:54.040 --> 00:04:00.670
backslash and you can see we have hidden our fig Mazz you y which is around our objects.

00:04:00.670 --> 00:04:09.040
So again you can show it by pressing and holding controller command plus backslash

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.690
Similarly,

00:04:10.690 --> 00:04:13.750
we have another shortcut which is search bar.

00:04:13.750 --> 00:04:19.320
So if you want to search something quickly in fig MMA or you want to add something all you

00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:20.780
want to search a plug in,

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:28.240
you have installed the shortcut key is control backslash so you can see control or command

00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:33.200
key command plus backslash so you can search for example,

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.460
every tar Andi,

00:04:35.460 --> 00:04:41.840
I just click over here air ITAR plug in and you can see here we have a name it are We can

00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:50.550
also again go to search and we can also search for for examples like this content real or

00:04:50.550 --> 00:04:53.440
company earned a lot of things.

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:54.590
There are short cars.

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:56.380
There are plug ins.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:05:00.160
Everything can be searched by this search bar over here,

00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:06.300
So this is a very common very easy to use Shortcut key controller Command forward slash.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:15.300
So you have to remember it back slash to hide your you I farmer slash toe such Now,

00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:18.470
if you are designing for Web sites or mobile APS,

00:05:18.470 --> 00:05:21.550
you might have your grids or columns layout over here.

00:05:21.550 --> 00:05:25.040
If you are familiar with bootstrap or other Gridley hours.

00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:29.150
So I'm going to quickly add a great over here,

00:05:29.150 --> 00:05:31.150
Let's add agreed.

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:33.760
And,

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.560
for example,

00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:37.150
we have this incredible here activated.

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:39.530
And if I want to hide it quickly,

00:05:39.530 --> 00:05:40.090
for example,

00:05:40.090 --> 00:05:43.640
I'm designing over here and I don't want toe,

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:44.310
you know,

00:05:44.310 --> 00:05:45.680
Bothered by this creed,

00:05:45.680 --> 00:05:48.520
I have toe use my shortcut key,

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:59.720
which is control shift plus four on Windows and Control plus G on Mac controlled Shift four

00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:01.960
on windows so you can see at the bottom.

00:06:01.960 --> 00:06:03.550
It says layout grid hidden.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.230
This is very nice in fig mark that it shows you the feedback,

00:06:10.230 --> 00:06:11.170
which is really,

00:06:11.170 --> 00:06:11.910
really nice.

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.670
Feature off any design software.

00:06:14.670 --> 00:06:17.540
If you are a user experience or familiar with user experience,

00:06:17.540 --> 00:06:19.550
you know that feedback is very important.

00:06:19.550 --> 00:06:23.110
So command G on a Mac.

00:06:23.110 --> 00:06:29.850
If you are a Mac user to hide this layout grade and control shift plus four,

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.220
these three keys are going to hide.

00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:33.980
Lee out creates on Windows,

00:06:33.980 --> 00:06:39.860
so that is all about some off the shortcuts that are going to hide and show different

00:06:39.860 --> 00:06:41.550
things while you're designing.

00:06:41.550 --> 00:06:46.350
Let's move on to the next lesson where I'm going to share with you some of the more

00:06:46.350 --> 00:06:49.520
shortcut keys you have to get familiar with.

00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.750
So let's move on to the next lesson.
