00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.140
in this video,

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:12.380
we're going to learn about Sigma and how we use different mosques and masking techniques

00:00:12.380 --> 00:00:13.010
and sigma.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:17.500
So masking is basically you have a container like you can see this rectangle.

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.760
This could be my container and all the elements.

00:00:20.760 --> 00:00:21.300
For example,

00:00:21.300 --> 00:00:22.730
images or buttons.

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.180
They are going to be inside this container.

00:00:25.180 --> 00:00:27.890
So if something's is bigger than this container,

00:00:27.890 --> 00:00:29.560
it is going to cut off.

00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:32.610
So it is not going to show outside off this container.

00:00:32.610 --> 00:00:34.970
So to better understand this example,

00:00:34.970 --> 00:00:37.350
we're going to drag and drop an image or here.

00:00:37.350 --> 00:00:41.270
So let's get this image and drop it over here.

00:00:41.270 --> 00:00:43.930
So this is very big.

00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:49.640
So I'm going to hold my ship key and just have some sizing over here.

00:00:49.640 --> 00:00:53.750
You can also quickly size using something like this or here.

00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:56.240
So now we have this image,

00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:58.700
and here we have the container.

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.760
So containment is at the back and image is at the front to create a mosque.

00:01:03.760 --> 00:01:05.200
We're going to select both of them,

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.200
so let's select and drag some selection around them.

00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.270
So both are selected and we're going to press art control,

00:01:12.270 --> 00:01:16.470
control all M or command option and to create a mosque.

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:21.150
So you can see now we have created the mosque successfully.

00:01:21.150 --> 00:01:22.100
Now,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.300
if you look at it over here so you can see this is our image.

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:26.460
This is our rectangle.

00:01:26.460 --> 00:01:27.430
This is our mosque.

00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:31.230
So if you try to select this container and move it around,

00:01:31.230 --> 00:01:37.840
you can see it is going to reveal the portion off the image we are actually using.

00:01:37.840 --> 00:01:40.230
We are actually aligning this rectangle,

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:43.320
so it is just like a portal.

00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:50.050
You can see it is a border where you can see the other dimensions foods anyhow,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.430
So this is how this images.

00:01:52.430 --> 00:01:54.110
So if you want to expand this image,

00:01:54.110 --> 00:02:00.620
you have to select this image and you have to skill it like this and we're going to play

00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:02.950
set over here like that.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:11.220
So if you work this rectangle or this container or this this actually mosque toe,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:12.440
have some roundness.

00:02:12.440 --> 00:02:15.260
Let's create 80 wrongness.

00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:19.040
So we have very nice this next,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:19.850
like this one.

00:02:19.850 --> 00:02:21.000
Oops.

00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:23.150
So we have this mosque,

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:24.250
this one,

00:02:24.250 --> 00:02:28.940
so we're going to select both off them to move them around like this.

00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:30.320
And if we want a group,

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.880
we can group them inside a group toe have this simple group so we don't want to see very

00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:37.350
big selection all the time.

00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:40.230
So this is how you create mosques.

00:02:40.230 --> 00:02:42.540
So now you are goingto added a mosque.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:44.280
So we have this mosque.

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:46.460
You have already seen that when it's like this one,

00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:49.340
I can change the size off it like this.

00:02:49.340 --> 00:02:54.760
I can change the position off the mosque and also if I want to change the size of the image

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.340
over here.

00:02:55.340 --> 00:02:58.710
So if I want Toby to make it smaller,

00:02:58.710 --> 00:03:01.850
I'm going to select this image and I am going toe.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.890
Make it smaller,

00:03:03.890 --> 00:03:04.720
like this,

00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.160
like this.

00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:08.570
Similarly,

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:10.200
if I want to change these corners,

00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:12.060
I'm going to use it this time.

00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:19.620
So this is how actually you create mosques are have container to create different kind of

00:03:19.620 --> 00:03:20.280
designs,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:23.670
where you are going to hide the rest off the portion now,

00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:24.450
Similarly,

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:28.020
you can have other elements to in the mosque.

00:03:28.020 --> 00:03:30.250
So if I have a burden for example,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:31.050
like this one,

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:33.440
let's create a button quickly button.

00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:36.110
So we have this button,

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.150
there's group it.

00:03:39.150 --> 00:03:41.140
Come on,

00:03:41.140 --> 00:03:41.750
G,

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:43.750
Bt in.

00:03:43.750 --> 00:03:49.390
And I wanted to be inside this rectangle or inside this container.

00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.150
So I want to have my button inside this mosque.

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:58.960
So I'm going to drag it over here and drop it over here just above this rectangle.

00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.220
So now you can see this addle extending extending from this image,

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.370
including this button and this rectangle.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:11.500
So it shows that these are the things that are inside this container.

00:04:11.500 --> 00:04:16.480
So now you can see I cannot see my button because it is outside of the container.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:18.800
It is just like a middle portal.

00:04:18.800 --> 00:04:20.510
You can see the other side.

00:04:20.510 --> 00:04:23.230
But if it if something is outside of that mirrors,

00:04:23.230 --> 00:04:24.160
you can view it,

00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.850
so you have to move it.

00:04:25.850 --> 00:04:28.610
So I'm trying to move it over here.

00:04:28.610 --> 00:04:33.450
So you have to move it inside this container like this.

00:04:33.450 --> 00:04:35.570
And now you can see it is behind this image.

00:04:35.570 --> 00:04:38.160
So I'm going to move it up Now.

00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.970
You can see it is inside this mosque and it is inside this container.

00:04:42.970 --> 00:04:45.450
This this mosque must area.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:46.420
So no.

00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:48.130
Should I want to move it around,

00:04:48.130 --> 00:04:48.740
For example,

00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:51.870
I want toe hide the right side off this button.

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.900
I can do that like this.

00:04:53.900 --> 00:04:58.310
This the other end off this burden is outside my container,

00:04:58.310 --> 00:05:00.000
so I cannot view it.

00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.410
So this is actually the technique technique off masking and,

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.090
ah,

00:05:05.090 --> 00:05:08.320
this is going to be very helpful in your design.

00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:12.350
I mostly use it whenever I import and images.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:17.390
I use a rectangle toe mask it so I can easily control its position.

00:05:17.390 --> 00:05:18.900
It's Ilya what?

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:20.760
I want to show what I want to hide.

00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:22.750
So this is really important concept.

00:05:22.750 --> 00:05:28.480
I hope you have understood this masking concept and how to use it and how to have a lot of

00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:30.150
elements inside a mosque.

00:05:30.150 --> 00:05:32.900
Let's move on to the next lesson.
