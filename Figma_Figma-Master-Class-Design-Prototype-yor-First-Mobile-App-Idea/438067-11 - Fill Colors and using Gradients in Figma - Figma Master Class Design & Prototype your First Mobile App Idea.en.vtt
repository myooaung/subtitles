00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.700
in this video.

00:00:05.700 --> 00:00:08.070
We're going to look at this fellow here,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:10.900
and we're going to explore different ways to use this field.

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:13.300
How you can use different colors like solar,

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:14.210
linear rainier,

00:00:14.210 --> 00:00:15.720
angular diamond,

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:16.430
an image.

00:00:16.430 --> 00:00:19.550
And we're not going to look at this image we have already discussed Stared.

00:00:19.550 --> 00:00:20.850
So,

00:00:20.850 --> 00:00:22.780
um,

00:00:22.780 --> 00:00:29.460
let's start by creating a rectangle over here and let's create one ellipse over here.

00:00:29.460 --> 00:00:31.090
So I'm holding shift.

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:37.100
Let's use some 300 corners like 16.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:40.160
Or here and now you can see that the file Phyllis C.

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:41.410
Four c four c four.

00:00:41.410 --> 00:00:42.940
This is its capacity.

00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.550
How much the colors should be transparent or north,

00:00:47.550 --> 00:00:48.550
something like that.

00:00:48.550 --> 00:00:50.350
So if I try to use,

00:00:50.350 --> 00:00:51.070
for example,

00:00:51.070 --> 00:00:56.550
like this color over here and I try to add another field and I want it to be,

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.750
um,

00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:02.800
some ingredients like this and let's change the color for this one,

00:01:02.800 --> 00:01:05.240
so the bottom one is going to be a killer.

00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:06.360
Next,

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.110
use this color,

00:01:07.110 --> 00:01:10.970
or now you can see the top one is actually a greedy int.

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:11.800
So if I tried,

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.110
when I click over here,

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.110
it says linear.

00:01:14.110 --> 00:01:21.330
So here we have solid color than we have linear Kenya has two points to off these points

00:01:21.330 --> 00:01:21.820
over here,

00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:27.490
which is actually going to show where the sculler is going to stop and start.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:29.840
So this color is going to start from here.

00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:31.170
If you want to add one more,

00:01:31.170 --> 00:01:36.380
you can click over here like this and you can use some color like this.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:36.850
For example,

00:01:36.850 --> 00:01:37.900
if you want toe,

00:01:37.900 --> 00:01:42.460
change it and you also want to change the top over here,

00:01:42.460 --> 00:01:43.110
for example,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:48.350
like this and you want the bottom to be very dark.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.050
You can use something like this.

00:01:51.050 --> 00:01:57.720
Now you can see we're using one linear ingredient on top off this blue colors.

00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:00.250
If you want to highlight this even see,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:04.020
we try to increase its capacity.

00:02:04.020 --> 00:02:06.620
It is going to show more beneath this Grady in.

00:02:06.620 --> 00:02:12.200
So this is kind off like a C green kind of radiant.

00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.950
And you can always you can also hide and show.

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:17.210
For example,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.610
you have feel like this.

00:02:18.610 --> 00:02:21.780
I can add as many fills I want,

00:02:21.780 --> 00:02:22.240
for example,

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:24.140
I want to add a radio.

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:26.550
Radio is going to be in destruction.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:29.090
So for radiant we're going to use this one.

00:02:29.090 --> 00:02:39.660
So that's I used radial and you can see now it has just regular and then it has vital er or

00:02:39.660 --> 00:02:41.400
transparency on one side.

00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:42.690
So if you click over here,

00:02:42.690 --> 00:02:44.340
you can see we have two settings.

00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:45.320
One is this color.

00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.750
One is this capacity.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:50.270
So for every point off colors,

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.760
you can have two things.

00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:52.300
For example,

00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:53.900
if I try to increase the opacity,

00:02:53.900 --> 00:02:57.200
you can see now we have Ah,

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:04.240
radial color with the boundary is actually a bit transparent and inside is a pick.

00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:06.380
So you can create many effects like this.

00:03:06.380 --> 00:03:07.060
For example,

00:03:07.060 --> 00:03:13.550
if I try to use something like this and I try to use white color over here,

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:16.750
you can see we have this kind off effect.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:20.880
You can see so outside is white,

00:03:20.880 --> 00:03:23.010
which is blending with this background.

00:03:23.010 --> 00:03:27.110
And inside is this killer so you can have more stops.

00:03:27.110 --> 00:03:27.640
For example,

00:03:27.640 --> 00:03:30.750
if you want to change the color on this section over here,

00:03:30.750 --> 00:03:32.370
for example,

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:34.370
like this'll,

00:03:34.370 --> 00:03:38.100
you can see now what is happening over here.

00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:39.330
Similarly,

00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:41.550
you can change the opacity off this one toe.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:53.650
So now I'm trying toe move circulars and there spacing.

00:03:53.650 --> 00:03:55.370
Let's dilute this one.

00:03:55.370 --> 00:03:55.790
So I am.

00:03:55.790 --> 00:03:58.350
I have selected this oneness has boundary press delete,

00:03:58.350 --> 00:04:01.080
and we have one color gone.

00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:03.270
Now you can see this is looking good.

00:04:03.270 --> 00:04:04.160
Similarly,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:04.760
for this one,

00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.320
we are going to remove the real one.

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.840
We're going to use linear now.

00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:13.080
A lot of things you can go over here.

00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:13.560
For example,

00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:14.850
if you click on this linear,

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:18.440
you can change the direction off this creedy int like this.

00:04:18.440 --> 00:04:22.450
So if I try to change the direction,

00:04:22.450 --> 00:04:29.880
I can change the direction like this press cross and you can see here we have another.

00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:34.900
So what I'm not going to do is I'm going to remove this excuse.

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.950
Um,

00:04:35.950 --> 00:04:37.950
dark over here,

00:04:37.950 --> 00:04:39.010
Onda,

00:04:39.010 --> 00:04:41.850
Let's increase the opacity off this section or here.

00:04:41.850 --> 00:04:44.050
Let's try toe.

00:04:44.050 --> 00:04:47.200
Move it like this.

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:50.680
Next.

00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:51.850
Move the colors around,

00:04:51.850 --> 00:04:53.950
like this.

00:04:53.950 --> 00:05:06.150
Exchange this one toe something like this that drag it out a bit more.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:11.960
So we have less color for this drop or this,

00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:12.450
uh,

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:13.970
point over here.

00:05:13.970 --> 00:05:16.440
So we have three points to the killer points.

00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:28.950
So this is you can create download button like that and white color over here.

00:05:28.950 --> 00:05:31.180
Similarly,

00:05:31.180 --> 00:05:32.710
you can do the same for here.

00:05:32.710 --> 00:05:36.390
If you want to create something for these,

00:05:36.390 --> 00:05:38.530
Uh these text over here,

00:05:38.530 --> 00:05:39.560
you can do the same.

00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.190
So exchange like this.

00:05:44.190 --> 00:05:59.250
So now you can see we have a lot of options.

00:05:59.250 --> 00:06:02.940
You can add as many feels a warm even in the text over here,

00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:04.940
even for these shapes.

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:08.960
Over here you can act 234 Whatever affect you want to create,

00:06:08.960 --> 00:06:11.710
you can create a similarly for radio.

00:06:11.710 --> 00:06:15.390
You can have these kind of things for angular.

00:06:15.390 --> 00:06:17.440
Mostly we don't need this.

00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:19.260
But maybe if you want to use,

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:20.660
you can see you're here.

00:06:20.660 --> 00:06:21.360
This is and will it?

00:06:21.360 --> 00:06:21.940
Actually,

00:06:21.940 --> 00:06:23.760
it creates something like this,

00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:26.320
which we mostly don't need.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.360
Maybe in some car interferes or something like that,

00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:32.710
we might need your diamond is going to have something like this.

00:06:32.710 --> 00:06:37.400
And the last one is image.

00:06:37.400 --> 00:06:38.780
We have already discussed this.

00:06:38.780 --> 00:06:43.060
So these are different color options thes are different.

00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:44.400
Phil options over here.

00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:46.950
You can also create styles for this feel.

00:06:46.950 --> 00:06:47.490
For example,

00:06:47.490 --> 00:06:49.980
I have this a greedy int over here.

00:06:49.980 --> 00:06:52.310
I'm going to click over here and use the screen,

00:06:52.310 --> 00:06:52.610
Ian,

00:06:52.610 --> 00:06:57.890
and save it inside ingredient second or something like that.

00:06:57.890 --> 00:07:04.980
So if I try to use any of the rectangle I can just click over here and press this and this

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.760
is going to be applied to this rectangle over here.

00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:17.100
So this is all about colors and different ingredients and how you can use different creedy

00:07:17.100 --> 00:07:17.600
INTs,

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:18.580
different effects,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:19.370
for example,

00:07:19.370 --> 00:07:20.930
this transparent fund.

00:07:20.930 --> 00:07:26.380
You can have it blend with the background over here to use the same color as the background

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:26.380
.

00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:31.650
You can see if we move it inside colored rectangle over here,

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:33.750
it is going to show its boundary,

00:07:33.750 --> 00:07:35.050
but on a white background,

00:07:35.050 --> 00:07:36.150
it is not going to show.

00:07:36.150 --> 00:07:38.420
So that is all about colors.

00:07:38.420 --> 00:07:41.110
If you have any questions you want to ask me,

00:07:41.110 --> 00:07:42.610
you can always ask me.

00:07:42.610 --> 00:07:45.150
Let's move on to the next lesson.
