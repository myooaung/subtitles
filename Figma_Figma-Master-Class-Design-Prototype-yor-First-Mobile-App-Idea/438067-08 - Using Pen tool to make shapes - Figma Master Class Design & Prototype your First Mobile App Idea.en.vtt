00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.750
in this video,

00:00:05.750 --> 00:00:11.460
we're going to learn about Sigma's Ben tool and how we can create different icons of shapes

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:14.170
or different types of things using pen tool.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:21.950
So this is basically for trying so you can press B and here we have the span and just click

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:25.160
and dragged withdraw straight lines like this,

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.850
and we're going back toe the first one to have this shape it was ship,

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.020
and you can see right now it shows we have stroke.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.060
And this is the stroke wit.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:41.350
So this is click on done.

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:45.560
And this is your shape right now you can expand it.

00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:49.590
You can change its thickness line thickness.

00:00:49.590 --> 00:00:51.030
You can also add fill,

00:00:51.030 --> 00:00:51.340
color,

00:00:51.340 --> 00:00:51.850
fill.

00:00:51.850 --> 00:00:53.600
Do it like this.

00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:56.220
Okay,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.840
so if you don't have any color fill,

00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.640
you can double click inside this shape on this ship,

00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:03.550
like over here,

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:10.350
and we're again back in the pen tool more so you can see where here we have been.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:14.150
This is actually Ben Tool and this is Spain buckets.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.660
So if you click on pain bucket and you can click over here,

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:22.590
it is again do the same thing which we did to fill this ship and If you go to this Bendel,

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.730
it is actually going toe bend these corners.

00:01:25.730 --> 00:01:27.040
So if you click on it,

00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:30.780
you can see Now we have upended corner over here like this.

00:01:30.780 --> 00:01:33.450
So we're here like this over here,

00:01:33.450 --> 00:01:40.550
like this Command or control z to go back so you can see now we have bended corners.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:44.050
So if you want to change any corner over here,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:45.640
you can again click over here.

00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.940
Once you have selected this and it's going to go back to the shape it waas.

00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:54.250
So let's go back to the span Tool.

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:56.980
Let's go back to the move tool.

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:01.940
So we're going to click this move and we're We can also move this our,

00:02:01.940 --> 00:02:02.840
for example,

00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:07.340
we have this Joffe or something like that.

00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:13.640
We can also move these handles toe have the shape bending to our needs,

00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:14.270
for example,

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:15.190
like this.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.270
And,

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:18.980
um if we want to move,

00:02:18.980 --> 00:02:20.170
does just this handle,

00:02:20.170 --> 00:02:20.680
for example,

00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:21.590
I want this handle.

00:02:21.590 --> 00:02:30.800
I don't want this handled toe move like this so you can see right now if we move it in this

00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:31.270
direction,

00:02:31.270 --> 00:02:31.950
it is moving.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:34.110
But if I try to move it in destruction,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:37.530
it is going to move along with this second handle.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:46.360
So you are going to press and hold Archy Archer option key to move this around without

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:51.070
moving the 2nd 1 you can see or hear like this,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.500
for example.

00:02:52.500 --> 00:02:58.680
I want to have something straight like this you can see now again,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.550
If we want to do same,

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:16.260
I can go back with here like this again.

00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:17.950
If I try to move this handle,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.580
it is going to move.

00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:20.350
Bought off them.

00:03:20.350 --> 00:03:26.850
So this is how you can move these handles around.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:30.950
You can option hold option or are to move the single one.

00:03:30.950 --> 00:03:34.980
You can also move them around this whole handle.

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:41.350
So this is one anchor point so I can move it around anywhere I want.

00:03:41.350 --> 00:03:44.900
I can create any kind off factors like this.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:46.710
I can remove the stroke.

00:03:46.710 --> 00:03:50.560
I can add different effects like shadow and everything.

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:51.610
Anything I want.

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.020
Oh,

00:03:52.020 --> 00:03:53.950
I can change its follicular.

00:03:53.950 --> 00:04:00.950
And that is the mean thing you can do with Bendel.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:10.500
So let's delete this whole vector and what I'm going to do is for example,

00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.040
I have this ship,

00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:12.570
for example.

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:13.450
I have lips.

00:04:13.450 --> 00:04:15.990
So I have I heard this Ellipse.

00:04:15.990 --> 00:04:17.760
Okay,

00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:21.930
So if I want to go into battle mood and want to change something in this ellipse,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:23.190
I'm going to double click on it.

00:04:23.190 --> 00:04:27.450
And you can see now we are again in this ah vector moored.

00:04:27.450 --> 00:04:29.830
So we have this pen to lower here.

00:04:29.830 --> 00:04:32.640
And if I want to add more anchor points over here,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:34.990
So if I want where one over here,

00:04:34.990 --> 00:04:37.150
let's press escape.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:38.900
And one,

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:45.820
we're here Press escape because we're just adding and goodbye solo Hit one over here,

00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.550
Skip.

00:04:46.550 --> 00:04:50.450
And one over here and the skip.

00:04:50.450 --> 00:04:52.790
Now I'm going to go to move,

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:53.100
Tool,

00:04:53.100 --> 00:04:54.830
and I'm going to move them around,

00:04:54.830 --> 00:04:55.650
for example,

00:04:55.650 --> 00:04:56.750
like this one,

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.570
I'm going to move it inside.

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.750
Similarly,

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.820
this one Oops.

00:05:05.820 --> 00:05:10.180
I'm going to go back to move,

00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:10.590
Tool.

00:05:10.590 --> 00:05:12.970
It's like this,

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:26.490
like this.

00:05:26.490 --> 00:05:32.390
You can see what I'm trying to make over here.

00:05:32.390 --> 00:05:34.860
So in this way,

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:37.380
you can create different icons if you want to.

00:05:37.380 --> 00:05:37.980
For example,

00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:39.470
if I go back to handle,

00:05:39.470 --> 00:05:42.350
I can create and others line over here.

00:05:42.350 --> 00:05:44.260
Move it like this.

00:05:44.260 --> 00:05:45.660
This,

00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:46.550
this,

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:47.920
like this.

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.740
Like this over here,

00:05:50.740 --> 00:05:51.560
like this.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:57.960
So here we go and let's move to the field goal again.

00:05:57.960 --> 00:06:04.900
Go to the bucket tool and I'm going to select other color.

00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:06.360
And I'm going to fill this one too.

00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:08.990
So one more thing,

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.950
which I think I forgot over here,

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:13.250
if you want to have something curved,

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:14.420
for example,

00:06:14.420 --> 00:06:15.480
if you have a pen tool,

00:06:15.480 --> 00:06:22.850
you can click over here and don't leave your most just drag and you will have occurred

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:23.820
angle.

00:06:23.820 --> 00:06:25.680
So if you want to have occurred angle,

00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:27.340
you can do something like this.

00:06:27.340 --> 00:06:33.050
So whenever you want a card girl angle,

00:06:33.050 --> 00:06:35.380
you can some do something like this.

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:44.490
So these are the basics off this plan to you can create icons.

00:06:44.490 --> 00:06:49.020
I don't recommend that you keep on creating different icons using the spent all.

00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:52.780
It is a waste off time I think you can use.

00:06:52.780 --> 00:06:58.920
You should use already build icon that are standard for any US or android device.

00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:01.070
So are on your websites.

00:07:01.070 --> 00:07:03.460
You can also purchase premium icons.

00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:08.780
It is a really waste off time if you keep on creating icons using this pen tool.

00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:11.430
Eso won.

00:07:11.430 --> 00:07:11.890
I gone.

00:07:11.890 --> 00:07:13.890
I mostly cleared with my students.

00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:18.110
Is this this shape like over here?

00:07:18.110 --> 00:07:19.080
This one.

00:07:19.080 --> 00:07:25.340
So let's move this first we're going to build a rectangle like this,

00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:28.880
and we will have rounded corners off 50 like this.

00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:35.610
Then we're going to use our pan tool and create something that's double click on it.

00:07:35.610 --> 00:07:37.360
So we have no handles over here.

00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:37.760
Now,

00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:38.850
create Pento.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:39.800
You spend tool,

00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:44.960
and we will have going to add a small ad over here.

00:07:44.960 --> 00:07:51.150
Hopes What is happening?

00:07:51.150 --> 00:07:56.640
Mm,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:57.550
like this.

00:07:57.550 --> 00:07:59.000
Like this.

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.050
This.

00:08:00.050 --> 00:08:01.430
Okay,

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.550
so we have created an ad over here.

00:08:03.550 --> 00:08:05.750
Let's fill it with the same color.

00:08:05.750 --> 00:08:11.970
So right now you can see here we have corner radius set to 50.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:16.560
So I'm going to use it to to have something like that.

00:08:16.560 --> 00:08:19.150
Let's use it.

00:08:19.150 --> 00:08:21.240
Okay,

00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.220
So let's click.

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:24.400
Click Escape,

00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:25.630
Breast Escape key.

00:08:25.630 --> 00:08:30.750
And this is how we have a very nice icon off speech bubble.

00:08:30.750 --> 00:08:34.650
You can see speech,

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:34.940
but well,

00:08:34.940 --> 00:08:37.250
let's use discolor.

00:08:37.250 --> 00:08:43.840
So this is how you can create and manipulate different shapes and different,

00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:45.980
different.

00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:49.950
You can create different simple icons using fig MMA.

00:08:49.950 --> 00:08:52.200
I think that is all.

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.700
I don't want you to create a very unique icon over here,

00:08:55.700 --> 00:09:00.140
but I would really add some exercise where you can create something like that and get

00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:02.600
familiar with this mental.

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.860
I hope you have enjoyed using this ban tool,

00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:08.510
and if you have any questions,

00:09:08.510 --> 00:09:09.870
you can always ask me,

00:09:09.870 --> 00:09:11.650
Let's move on to the next lesson.
