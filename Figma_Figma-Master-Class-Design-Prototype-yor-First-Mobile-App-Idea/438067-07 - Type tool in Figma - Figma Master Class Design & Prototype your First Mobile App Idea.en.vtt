00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760
in this video.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.880
We're going to talk about text tool over here.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:10.190
So just besty or text,

00:00:10.190 --> 00:00:16.650
click this text and you can drag something like this to create a text box Over here.

00:00:16.650 --> 00:00:17.400
Tokyo,

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:18.050
The paragraph.

00:00:18.050 --> 00:00:19.570
This is a paragraph,

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:21.130
LA,

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:21.400
blah,

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:21.680
blah,

00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:22.050
blah,

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.360
blah,

00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:22.600
blah.

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.950
So you can see now it is going inside this container.

00:00:26.950 --> 00:00:28.880
Similarly,

00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:31.800
you can also use something like this over here,

00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:33.980
so you can see these are the options on the right.

00:00:33.980 --> 00:00:35.350
So we have text options.

00:00:35.350 --> 00:00:37.090
This is formed typeface,

00:00:37.090 --> 00:00:38.030
which is Roberto.

00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:43.950
You can create change to whatever it is you have on your installed on your system.

00:00:43.950 --> 00:00:45.010
This is ah,

00:00:45.010 --> 00:00:46.290
type size.

00:00:46.290 --> 00:00:47.410
Um,

00:00:47.410 --> 00:00:49.890
so right now we don't have any options.

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:51.100
Let's clear.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:52.550
Drew's this one.

00:00:52.550 --> 00:00:53.660
Okay,

00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:54.940
so here we have,

00:00:54.940 --> 00:00:56.970
she was this size.

00:00:56.970 --> 00:00:59.040
Okay,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.000
so we have regular medium board.

00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.050
These are different styles off this text.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:05.080
Then we have auto.

00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.140
This is basically line height.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:12.150
I can change it to 1 30 Or I can put for example,

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:14.290
200% over here.

00:01:14.290 --> 00:01:15.450
Something like that.

00:01:15.450 --> 00:01:19.330
So this is basically the difference in between the two lines,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:21.050
the sex between the two lines,

00:01:21.050 --> 00:01:24.500
and you can see what had these blue lines?

00:01:24.500 --> 00:01:28.750
This is actually the distance between these blue lines below your next,

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:30.750
which is scored baseline.

00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:33.380
Then we have letter spacing.

00:01:33.380 --> 00:01:36.580
You can have 5% better spacing or anything you want.

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:37.250
We're here.

00:01:37.250 --> 00:01:39.330
Then we have paragraph spacing.

00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:41.640
So if we have more than two paragraphs,

00:01:41.640 --> 00:01:42.440
for example,

00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:45.440
let's change it.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:48.150
100% hopes.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:49.870
Let's change it.

00:01:49.870 --> 00:01:54.450
100% and excuse 2%.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:58.130
And we will have another paragraph.

00:01:58.130 --> 00:01:58.590
Or here.

00:01:58.590 --> 00:01:59.550
Like this?

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:02.100
Yes.

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:02.560
Here.

00:02:02.560 --> 00:02:05.670
This is another girl.

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:12.160
This will this cap and no,

00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:13.650
If I try to use this,

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.070
it is going toe.

00:02:15.070 --> 00:02:17.340
Give some gap between these two paragraphs.

00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:20.080
It is already detected that I have breast and drawer here.

00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.810
And this is going to be the next paragraph so I can have more space within two paragraphs

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:27.270
and,

00:02:27.270 --> 00:02:27.650
uh,

00:02:27.650 --> 00:02:29.350
escape.

00:02:29.350 --> 00:02:32.550
And this is how it is going to.

00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:34.340
This is actually my container.

00:02:34.340 --> 00:02:41.750
So I can moving around like this to have more information inside it.

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:43.520
Okay,

00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:46.060
so this shows that it is a fixed size.

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:47.850
This shows that is auto height.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:54.250
So it is again blood to this bottom off this text over here.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.720
And then we have out of it.

00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:58.190
So when we click out of it,

00:02:58.190 --> 00:03:03.730
it is going toe Move around this it is going to have its own verdict.

00:03:03.730 --> 00:03:09.250
So it is good when you are creating some buttons but in a paragraph you're going to use

00:03:09.250 --> 00:03:11.290
fixed like this.

00:03:11.290 --> 00:03:14.450
So let's school back,

00:03:14.450 --> 00:03:16.750
Kamanzi.

00:03:16.750 --> 00:03:23.470
And now we have different options off alignment middle align top align Bottom line it is

00:03:23.470 --> 00:03:24.250
going to have.

00:03:24.250 --> 00:03:25.670
For example,

00:03:25.670 --> 00:03:27.210
if I have something like this,

00:03:27.210 --> 00:03:28.690
a bigger container,

00:03:28.690 --> 00:03:33.130
I can drop a line this I can middle align it inside this container.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:34.310
You can see this blue line.

00:03:34.310 --> 00:03:40.350
This is container and I can also align it at the bottom of this container So it depends how

00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:41.550
I won't get your line.

00:03:41.550 --> 00:03:45.080
Then we have center left and right a line off the text.

00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:46.560
So there's a stakes alignment,

00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:46.930
right,

00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:48.850
left Incentive.

00:03:48.850 --> 00:03:55.240
So this is basically the alignment within this container and this is the alignment off the

00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:56.470
text out of weird,

00:03:56.470 --> 00:03:58.430
different order height settings.

00:03:58.430 --> 00:04:05.660
How this how this container will be here and then we have a few more options like you can

00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:10.350
see where here few more options are like we can justify it over here than we have

00:04:10.350 --> 00:04:12.390
underlying on.

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:14.260
Then we have this none than we have.

00:04:14.260 --> 00:04:16.250
Strike to something like this.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:18.890
Paragraph in Dent.

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:22.950
If you want to indenture paragraph like this and the starting of the paragraph,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:24.960
uh,

00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.700
then we have different cases.

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.080
Upper case.

00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.140
Lower case.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:31.290
This is title case,

00:04:31.290 --> 00:04:38.260
and this is as tight I know about these gates sensitive forms and capital species is

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.900
spacing.

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:42.710
So these are different options that are the fort.

00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:45.140
Advanced options are open type options.

00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:50.270
So right now you can see I have selected this rasa phone and you can see this Typhus has

00:04:50.270 --> 00:04:56.150
capital spacing and case sensitive forms so you can have these options click if you want to

00:04:56.150 --> 00:04:56.810
use them.

00:04:56.810 --> 00:04:58.100
For example,

00:04:58.100 --> 00:05:01.970
if I try to use capital spacing over here,

00:05:01.970 --> 00:05:04.570
war is near,

00:05:04.570 --> 00:05:05.280
for example,

00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:05.880
like this.

00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:09.160
So now look closely if I try to,

00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.850
uh,

00:05:09.850 --> 00:05:18.150
use this capital spacing so you can see capital spacing turn on Capitol spacing off.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:19.270
Similarly,

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:21.690
we have these style number styles.

00:05:21.690 --> 00:05:26.860
So if I try to use 123456789 to you,

00:05:26.860 --> 00:05:28.350
something like that.

00:05:28.350 --> 00:05:32.320
So you can see we can have this friend number styles.

00:05:32.320 --> 00:05:33.960
These are again different options,

00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:38.160
so these are actually options off open type type faces.

00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:41.540
You can see there are stylistic stylistic options.

00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:42.540
Horizontal spacing,

00:05:42.540 --> 00:05:44.760
cunning fraction denominators.

00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:47.240
I think we don't want to use all these,

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:51.150
but I think you should know that these are the options available were here.

00:05:51.150 --> 00:05:53.180
So if you are a typographic geek,

00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:57.090
you can use these stylistic sets or options over here.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:06:02.820
So that is all about this tax tool.

00:06:02.820 --> 00:06:03.420
And,

00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:04.150
um,

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:12.820
I think you will understand what it does and how you can change your four style sizes.

00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:14.960
Different spacing between lines.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.950
Different spacing between paragraphs,

00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.170
how it is going to behave.

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:20.160
It's auto height.

00:06:20.160 --> 00:06:27.150
Weird things like their tax alignment inside the container or decks alignment off the text

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:27.850
itself.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:30.570
So that is all about Dex layers.

00:06:30.570 --> 00:06:34.400
If you have any suggestions or any improvements in the course,

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:35.810
you can always commend,

00:06:35.810 --> 00:06:37.760
and you can always discuss with me.

00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.220
If you don't understand anything,

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.650
you can ask me questions.

00:06:40.650 --> 00:06:43.170
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:06:43.170 --> 00:06:45.450
Let's move on to the next lesson
