00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.300
before we start designing this,

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:07.870
uh,

00:00:07.870 --> 00:00:11.310
nice app off how the recipes.

00:00:11.310 --> 00:00:17.260
I'm going to show you what is my planning process and how I have reached this design.

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.650
What inspired me?

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:22.120
How I selected thes colors for my color scheme.

00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:23.770
Although I have different courses,

00:00:23.770 --> 00:00:24.940
you can look at them.

00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.300
I have color scheme course.

00:00:26.300 --> 00:00:29.050
Is that how you can master the color scheme?

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:30.590
Typography selection?

00:00:30.590 --> 00:00:34.460
I'm not going to go into a lot of details because these are big,

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.380
bigger topics.

00:00:35.380 --> 00:00:42.220
But whenever I start designing anything from user experience,

00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.050
point of view,

00:00:43.050 --> 00:00:44.330
you are going toe.

00:00:44.330 --> 00:00:48.450
Always have some off thes wire frames.

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:49.710
So without these,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:53.690
you are not going to go anywhere before these wire frames.

00:00:53.690 --> 00:00:54.060
We have,

00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:54.120
ah,

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.280
hold user experience,

00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:56.190
design process,

00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:56.950
use the stories,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:00:58.140
use the scenarios,

00:00:58.140 --> 00:00:58.890
affinity,

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:00.640
diagrams and all that stuff.

00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:02.490
So we are going to interview users.

00:01:02.490 --> 00:01:04.980
We're going to see what are their needs,

00:01:04.980 --> 00:01:08.730
and we're going toe convert your knees needs toe,

00:01:08.730 --> 00:01:09.830
do the stories,

00:01:09.830 --> 00:01:11.170
wars and features,

00:01:11.170 --> 00:01:14.840
and those features are going to be on a vile frame.

00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.560
So wire frame is going to be the starting point off user interface design or whenever you

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:20.500
are going to design.

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.400
So we have all the user needs over here.

00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:25.630
And you can see this is my logon screen.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.390
These are the skin sharks off my drawing.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:28.940
Bad.

00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:31.280
Pardon my design,

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:34.410
or I actually try to be as simple as possible.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:37.680
And you can see we have I have the idea of having some,

00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:38.930
um,

00:01:38.930 --> 00:01:41.050
place or something.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.390
Some apples over here.

00:01:42.390 --> 00:01:43.240
Something like that.

00:01:43.240 --> 00:01:43.370
Yeah.

00:01:43.370 --> 00:01:48.410
Comes log in with Facebook and log in with Google and skip the Logan,

00:01:48.410 --> 00:01:49.030
for example.

00:01:49.030 --> 00:01:50.660
I have seen and studied,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.780
like,

00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:57.090
four or five popular me laps before designing this one.

00:01:57.090 --> 00:01:58.490
This is really important.

00:01:58.490 --> 00:01:59.850
So I'm going to show you,

00:01:59.850 --> 00:02:00.800
Uh,

00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:03.750
this is the inspiration for me for the color scheme,

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:06.340
so I really love the green and orange.

00:02:06.340 --> 00:02:07.940
So I mainly use this.

00:02:07.940 --> 00:02:09.380
So this is actually a color scheme.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:11.710
But I'm not copping this color scheme.

00:02:11.710 --> 00:02:12.550
It is different.

00:02:12.550 --> 00:02:14.160
These are different colors.

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:18.520
Now you can see I'm going to go toe inspiration for their cynicism.

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:20.990
And then we have an idea supporter.

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.770
So in this ideas for a you can see these are the popular recipe abs,

00:02:25.770 --> 00:02:28.420
but none of them looks like mind.

00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:30.830
So minus totally different I got the ideas.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.880
Different ideas like this bottom navigation.

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.050
What are different things?

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:39.280
You can see some off the things.

00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:39.840
For example,

00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:41.590
the star ratings this.

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:44.420
Then we have the search icon over here.

00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:51.470
So some of the legal adoption some off the killer's some off the you can say ideas like you

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:54.130
can see these are separated by these lines.

00:02:54.130 --> 00:02:56.660
And if I look in my design,

00:02:56.660 --> 00:02:59.680
you can see I have used this similar lines.

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:02.690
You might not notice these very simple things.

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.750
You can see I have these in my ingredients over here.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.060
So this is really important.

00:03:08.060 --> 00:03:11.790
You get a lot of ideas from seeing other ideas.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:19.710
You are going to have a lot of ideas if you keep on looking different ideas on other I

00:03:19.710 --> 00:03:20.930
Other abs.

00:03:20.930 --> 00:03:26.370
Other designers you have tow expand your you can say design,

00:03:26.370 --> 00:03:29.330
taste and keep on looking on different designs.

00:03:29.330 --> 00:03:30.250
It is going toe,

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.040
give you inspiration and it is going to improve you as a designer.

00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:38.780
So these are you can see different inspirations.

00:03:38.780 --> 00:03:45.650
And these are the ideas I had and from thes I went toe have something like this.

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:50.880
So I keep on trying these fire frames and you can see we have mean Sellards desserts,

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.350
desserts healthy,

00:03:53.350 --> 00:03:58.230
featured on the 30 meters healthy recipes recipe title stars,

00:03:58.230 --> 00:03:59.870
ingredients and preparation.

00:03:59.870 --> 00:04:03.840
Because these are the two most important things without ingredients,

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:08.380
you cannot start preparing your recipe so ingredients are going to come for.

00:04:08.380 --> 00:04:11.520
So whenever someone lords this ab,

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.990
these are this is actually loaded first,

00:04:13.990 --> 00:04:16.180
and then you move to the preparation.

00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:19.230
Similarly,

00:04:19.230 --> 00:04:21.570
you can see if we go back to wire frames.

00:04:21.570 --> 00:04:23.450
We have such options over here,

00:04:23.450 --> 00:04:28.380
then this is my log in account settings,

00:04:28.380 --> 00:04:31.550
and these are the things I had in mind.

00:04:31.550 --> 00:04:35.020
So a few more things like you can see or hear,

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:35.200
hear.

00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:37.780
We have different allergies and diets you prefer.

00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:44.810
So this is actually this is a feature I actually designed and implemented in my search over

00:04:44.810 --> 00:04:45.020
here,

00:04:45.020 --> 00:04:49.500
so you can see if I go to search so you can see if you try to search something,

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:50.950
you have a lot of filters.

00:04:50.950 --> 00:04:51.610
Officials.

00:04:51.610 --> 00:04:53.050
I died plan filters.

00:04:53.050 --> 00:04:56.710
Filters are common allergies like these other common allergies.

00:04:56.710 --> 00:04:58.810
People have soy food,

00:04:58.810 --> 00:04:59.520
whole grains,

00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:00.100
gluten,

00:05:00.100 --> 00:05:01.880
including analogies or something like that.

00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:04.130
So you can click and select both off them.

00:05:04.130 --> 00:05:09.490
You can either select the diet and you can either select an allergy you have.

00:05:09.490 --> 00:05:11.430
And this is going to be the results.

00:05:11.430 --> 00:05:20.010
Eso it is going to have fill this such bar and it will show you the results So you can see

00:05:20.010 --> 00:05:26.200
I have also added this color which is inside this color scheme and also this orange so you

00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:30.300
can see I have actually changed some of the aspects.

00:05:30.300 --> 00:05:30.920
For example,

00:05:30.920 --> 00:05:33.180
I have a lot off dim,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.880
dull green in the background over hair rather than agree or some green color.

00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:39.280
I said this.

00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.250
You can see what here and the phones I'm using.

00:05:42.250 --> 00:05:47.590
Over here are these Rubik Google forms and Yanta money.

00:05:47.590 --> 00:05:53.310
So if you are going to start this design are open up.

00:05:53.310 --> 00:06:00.560
My design in your phlegm ahap try to download and install these forms is a really beautiful

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:01.450
sense.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:06.900
Sense said if orange and easy to read and have some style to it.

00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:08.080
These are very clear.

00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:13.380
So these are the two forts die faces I have used in designing this.

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:14.870
This is the logo.

00:06:14.870 --> 00:06:20.030
I designed myself just for this exercise quickly.

00:06:20.030 --> 00:06:21.870
So you can understand.

00:06:21.870 --> 00:06:25.630
You could just understand the meaning off this.

00:06:25.630 --> 00:06:26.680
And,

00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:27.450
uh,

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:28.600
that is all.

00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:31.190
So I have some off the icons over here,

00:06:31.190 --> 00:06:32.370
which I actually,

00:06:32.370 --> 00:06:37.450
um you can say I have an AB which is called Nuclear AB.

00:06:37.450 --> 00:06:38.090
Over here,

00:06:38.090 --> 00:06:44.670
I use the icons from this You can use icons from Google Material Design,

00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.790
Google Material icon.

00:06:45.790 --> 00:06:52.220
So you can such koukal material Icahn's And here you can go over here.

00:06:52.220 --> 00:07:00.290
I can material design and you can select down Lord from here so you can see we have arrows

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:00.290
.

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:01.230
Different kind of adults.

00:07:01.230 --> 00:07:02.390
These are standard icons.

00:07:02.390 --> 00:07:04.650
You can use icons from him.

00:07:04.650 --> 00:07:07.130
There are many videos.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:11.550
I have shown that how to download and use a whole icon.

00:07:11.550 --> 00:07:13.510
You can see a system.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.250
I'm going to share these icons with you if you want.

00:07:16.250 --> 00:07:20.020
And you can have these these SPD files.

00:07:20.020 --> 00:07:24.350
I prefer to use SPG files as an icon because they're expandable.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:26.920
So that is all.

00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:30.750
That is how my whole design went hand.

00:07:30.750 --> 00:07:31.650
And,

00:07:31.650 --> 00:07:32.520
uh,

00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:35.660
I hope you will enjoy this exercise and learn from it all.

00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:36.690
Actually designed it.

00:07:36.690 --> 00:07:38.840
I always vision.

00:07:38.840 --> 00:07:44.280
Always suggest that if you are Regan typography or color scheme or layer design,

00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:51.520
you have to take other courses which are going toe improve your design skills learning a

00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.160
tool and design skills are two separate things.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:57.320
I hope you have enjoyed this video.

00:07:57.320 --> 00:07:59.670
How to prepare your before your design.

00:07:59.670 --> 00:08:02.980
You have to download these four typefaces you have tow.

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:04.630
Select your color scheme.

00:08:04.630 --> 00:08:08.260
You have to have some ideas and inspiration in your bag,

00:08:08.260 --> 00:08:11.040
and you have to have your vile friends,

00:08:11.040 --> 00:08:11.550
Freddie.

00:08:11.550 --> 00:08:16.950
So let's move on to the next lecture and start designing now.
