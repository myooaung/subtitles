00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.760
you have already learned how mosque things.

00:00:02.760 --> 00:00:05.550
So now is the time for your assignment.

00:00:05.550 --> 00:00:08.220
So now I'm going to give you an assignment,

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:08.560
toe,

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.020
mosque and object or any image,

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:17.650
and you are going to create some introductory text about yourself that I have four cares or

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:24.650
I love to watch enemy cartoons or I am very busy or I am a nurse by profession or whatever

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.880
is on your mind.

00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:31.330
So whatever are your hobbies or you do or you your love is about,

00:00:31.330 --> 00:00:35.250
you have to share it with me and use your own image.

00:00:35.250 --> 00:00:38.020
It is better that we introduce ourselves.

00:00:38.020 --> 00:00:40.770
So let me show you my skin what I have created.

00:00:40.770 --> 00:00:47.600
And I'm going to also going to give you some off the tips on how to create the's masking.

00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:50.170
And what are the problems that you can get.

00:00:50.170 --> 00:00:53.350
So let's done toe over screens now.

00:00:53.350 --> 00:00:57.080
Now you can see here I have created two screens.

00:00:57.080 --> 00:00:58.350
Um,

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.470
this is a custom mosque.

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.380
I have created a shape over here,

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:05.430
and I have inserted my image inside,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.210
and they are inside a group.

00:01:07.210 --> 00:01:11.300
It's always better that you group your group,

00:01:11.300 --> 00:01:13.070
your elements that have been masked.

00:01:13.070 --> 00:01:13.780
Otherwise,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:17.450
the stigma is going to keep on adding things in them.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.050
So whenever you start with this,

00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:21.640
you can create something like this.

00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:24.560
You can use an ellipse over here,

00:01:24.560 --> 00:01:26.850
draw an ellipse with holding shift,

00:01:26.850 --> 00:01:29.210
drag your image inside it.

00:01:29.210 --> 00:01:30.320
And like this,

00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.250
for example,

00:01:31.250 --> 00:01:36.470
let me draw on drag this you can see No,

00:01:36.470 --> 00:01:40.160
I have an image every tar on my lips.

00:01:40.160 --> 00:01:43.690
I am going to select both off them ellipses at the bottom mosque.

00:01:43.690 --> 00:01:48.580
And I'm going to move this inside this here like this.

00:01:48.580 --> 00:01:50.090
So this is easy.

00:01:50.090 --> 00:01:52.340
And always try toe,

00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:53.350
create a group,

00:01:53.350 --> 00:01:56.150
so it's easier toe.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:56.850
Manage them.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.860
So this is one day now.

00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:02.150
If you try to create a shape with the pendulum,

00:02:02.150 --> 00:02:02.920
for example,

00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.950
I try to create a shape like this,

00:02:04.950 --> 00:02:07.810
and I want to insert an image inside.

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.950
There is a trick you can see over here.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.050
There is no Phil are over here,

00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:14.920
so try to add Phil first.

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:15.930
Otherwise,

00:02:15.930 --> 00:02:17.820
your image is not going to fill this.

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:23.150
So let's let's bring this again.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:26.850
And here we have it.

00:02:26.850 --> 00:02:29.050
Let's like water off them mosque,

00:02:29.050 --> 00:02:34.730
and now you can see I have created a very custom mosque with the custom shape over here.

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:41.350
So always remember that Try to fill your vector shape before doing something like that.

00:02:41.350 --> 00:02:44.470
So this is the example.

00:02:44.470 --> 00:02:46.110
So start with your name.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:46.900
Welcome,

00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:53.830
John or Sarah or whatever your name is and then to figure class and then something about

00:02:53.830 --> 00:02:54.330

00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.490
Like I watch a lot of enemy gardens.

00:02:57.490 --> 00:03:01.840
Mostly lately re superpowers love to explore all kind of designs.

00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:05.890
Even I love to explore into your design or any kind of design.

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:09.290
Three d or I love toe see them wash them.

00:03:09.290 --> 00:03:14.750
And I have four kids and freelancing from past 10 years.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:16.550
This is my simple introduction,

00:03:16.550 --> 00:03:19.650
and you can have a button very uses.

00:03:19.650 --> 00:03:21.120
Let's start or be humble.

00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:26.650
Always whatever you think is the key word to your life.

00:03:26.650 --> 00:03:29.860
So this is the assignment for masking.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.050
So make sure you created I'm going toe keep on looking for your assignment.

00:03:35.050 --> 00:03:36.090
