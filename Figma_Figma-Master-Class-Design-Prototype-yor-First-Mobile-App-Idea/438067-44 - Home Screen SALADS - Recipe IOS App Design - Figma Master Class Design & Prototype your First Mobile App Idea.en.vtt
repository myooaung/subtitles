00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.960
in this lesson.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:10.420
We're going to create the next fuel screens and you can see we're here.

00:00:10.420 --> 00:00:10.980
Here we have.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:13.190
Sellards deserves healthy,

00:00:13.190 --> 00:00:15.500
so these are almost the same.

00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:22.190
The only exception is that these the menu bar over here it is actually moving from active

00:00:22.190 --> 00:00:23.750
toe in active.

00:00:23.750 --> 00:00:27.600
And this background is actually moving around in over here.

00:00:27.600 --> 00:00:29.690
So we are going toe,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:32.790
use this and just change through off the tax.

00:00:32.790 --> 00:00:33.570
This is the same.

00:00:33.570 --> 00:00:37.140
So I'm going to really skip it very fast.

00:00:37.140 --> 00:00:39.820
Or maybe I am going to skip this section.

00:00:39.820 --> 00:00:45.030
I'm going to just focus on the top over here because everything is the same.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:46.730
Just we are changing images,

00:00:46.730 --> 00:00:48.050
values off this one,

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:48.980
That is all.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:49.760
If we have,

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:54.780
If you have any questions you can always ask me and that will solve your problem if you

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:55.150
have.

00:00:55.150 --> 00:00:56.370
If you find any problem,

00:00:56.370 --> 00:00:57.450
everything is same.

00:00:57.450 --> 00:01:00.480
Only were changing text and images.

00:01:00.480 --> 00:01:02.940
This stop recipe and navigation.

00:01:02.940 --> 00:01:04.840
I'm going to explain in this lesson.

00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:06.310
So let's get started.

00:01:06.310 --> 00:01:10.670
And what we're going to do is we're going to replicate this screen,

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:16.550
and the first thing we're going to do is moved to this area over here,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:18.150
Skip.

00:01:18.150 --> 00:01:18.940
Okay,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.540
so this is active,

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.450
inactive.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.250
And first,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:28.280
what we're going to do is we're going to remove the inactive and go to inactive state,

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:30.090
because now on the meals is gone.

00:01:30.090 --> 00:01:32.110
We want a bad ground.

00:01:32.110 --> 00:01:35.660
Toby moved to salads over here.

00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.080
And we are also going to change its rich,

00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.050
because now it is looking a bit smaller because salads is a big word.

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:46.750
So this is going to be over here like that.

00:01:46.750 --> 00:01:48.550
Okay,

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:50.820
So sellers for sellers,

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:52.180
we have active state.

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:53.730
An inactive is going to be hidden.

00:01:53.730 --> 00:01:56.150
So this is how it is going to move.

00:01:56.150 --> 00:01:58.020
Um,

00:01:58.020 --> 00:02:01.460
so now we are going to do the same.

00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:05.250
We're going to just change all these images and everything.

00:02:05.250 --> 00:02:07.910
The tax store here quickly.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.080
And that is all.

00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:39.890
I normally try to hide my bottom navigation once you

00:02:39.890 --> 00:02:43.830
can lock it or you can hide it toe easily,

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:45.200
manipulate these items.

00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.150
So I'm going toe.

00:02:46.150 --> 00:02:48.000
Mostly hide it like that.

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:53.280
If something like this happens,

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:56.750
it is because we have cited toe crop so you can go to fill,

00:02:56.750 --> 00:03:01.850
and then you can again goto crop to place it where you wanted to be.

00:03:01.850 --> 00:03:03.410
So this is happening.

00:03:03.410 --> 00:03:03.880
Actually,

00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:06.850
I have specified Grob Ah,

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.680
in my,

00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:09.330
um,

00:03:09.330 --> 00:03:14.150
previous scam McCandless or are bored over here.

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.590
So this is happening with me,

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:18.860
so don't need to worry about it.

00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:20.480
You can fix this.

00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.850
So if I go to this,

00:03:21.850 --> 00:03:27.550
I can use Phil and then I can select any image from here.

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:35.290
Maybe this one and I am going toe drop it over here like this,

00:03:35.290 --> 00:03:41.910
and then I can go toe crop and move it around like this.

00:03:41.910 --> 00:03:52.530
So now you can see this screen is also completed the second next to are also the same.

00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:54.760
So I'm not going to repeat us.

00:03:54.760 --> 00:03:57.150
Same design steps again,

00:03:57.150 --> 00:03:57.560
again.

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:00.820
So I'm going to create them by my own,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:05.860
and I'm going to skip those lessons because that is the same thing we're going to do in the

00:04:05.860 --> 00:04:06.950
next two screens.

00:04:06.950 --> 00:04:08.150
So,

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:09.180
once I have completed,

00:04:09.180 --> 00:04:11.450
all these screens were going to meet next,

00:04:11.450 --> 00:04:17.770
and we're going toe actually use our prototyping tools to prototype these four and five

00:04:17.770 --> 00:04:18.290
skins.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:20.780
So let's move on to the next lesson.
