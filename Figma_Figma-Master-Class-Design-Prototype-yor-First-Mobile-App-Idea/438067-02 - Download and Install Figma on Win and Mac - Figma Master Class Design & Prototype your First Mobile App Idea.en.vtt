00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.910
in this video,

00:00:05.910 --> 00:00:08.420
we are going to go head to figment dot com,

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:10.540
and we're going to download figure MMA,

00:00:10.540 --> 00:00:15.000
and we will see what are different features and how we can use them.

00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.320
What is the pricing model off Fig?

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:17.680
Mom,

00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.460
what is the free version gives and what is the paid version?

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:22.420
Differences.

00:00:22.420 --> 00:00:24.090
So let's get started.

00:00:24.090 --> 00:00:24.810
No.

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:29.550
First you are going to go to figure dot com and this is their website,

00:00:29.550 --> 00:00:32.750
and you can see here they say strife Igman for free.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:35.780
So you have to create your account over here,

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:40.180
so you are going to go to sign up and create your account.

00:00:40.180 --> 00:00:41.750
This is the first step.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:44.180
Now the second step is,

00:00:44.180 --> 00:00:46.160
once you have created your account,

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.920
you're going to go to downloads sigma dot com slash downloads.

00:00:49.920 --> 00:00:55.770
As you can go from recess role resource is and go to downloads and here's you're going to

00:00:55.770 --> 00:00:57.390
download desktop app.

00:00:57.390 --> 00:01:00.750
For if you are on a Mac OS or Mac operating system,

00:01:00.750 --> 00:01:03.350
you're going to download this desktop app,

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:05.130
and if you are on Windows,

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.990
you're going to download the desktop app for Windows.

00:01:07.990 --> 00:01:08.990
Now,

00:01:08.990 --> 00:01:16.090
if you try to use your fig MMA on your browser than you are going to use this map.

00:01:16.090 --> 00:01:17.020
Quest installer,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:17.860
Windows installer.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:23.300
Most of the people I think 99.9% they're going to download these do.

00:01:23.300 --> 00:01:25.530
So we don't need to worry about this.

00:01:25.530 --> 00:01:32.390
Fort installers just download the desktop app and install it on your PC or Mac.

00:01:32.390 --> 00:01:33.470
Now here,

00:01:33.470 --> 00:01:35.780
I'm going to show you what is the pricing model.

00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:41.350
And what are the features that are in different pricing models for this fig model?

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:46.620
First is free so you can create after two editors.

00:01:46.620 --> 00:01:50.480
Would you just mean that two people can edit a single project?

00:01:50.480 --> 00:01:55.130
You can have a team off to designers and three projects,

00:01:55.130 --> 00:01:56.800
and you can create three projects.

00:01:56.800 --> 00:01:59.560
Maximum off three projects,

00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:01.760
30 day version history.

00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:05.870
So this tow this actually saves your,

00:02:05.870 --> 00:02:06.710
um,

00:02:06.710 --> 00:02:08.320
design versions.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.450
So whatever the changes you are doing to a design file,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:17.160
they are going to be saved for only 30 days and unlimited dollars storied.

00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:19.240
You can use our upload,

00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:22.340
any file or any size off file.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:23.720
That is not a problem.

00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.160
Unlimited free viewers so you can share your projects with unlimited people that they can

00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.210
view your project.

00:02:31.210 --> 00:02:35.980
Now you can see here we have professional and organization.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:36.750
Now,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:41.370
the main thing that we will be looking for we're here is unlimited version history.

00:02:41.370 --> 00:02:42.440
This is the first thing,

00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.020
and second he is invite only private projects.

00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:47.780
So,

00:02:47.780 --> 00:02:48.620
for example,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:52.890
if they are companies or enterprise is they want to work on just private projects,

00:02:52.890 --> 00:02:56.890
they can create invite only they can send,

00:02:56.890 --> 00:02:59.910
invite only private invitations,

00:02:59.910 --> 00:03:02.190
toe different members,

00:03:02.190 --> 00:03:08.880
shareable team libraries So you can design your design libraries and share them with in

00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:09.650
your team.

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:12.050
That is another profession feature.

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:12.990
So,

00:03:12.990 --> 00:03:13.620
um,

00:03:13.620 --> 00:03:15.370
these are the differences.

00:03:15.370 --> 00:03:17.490
So if you are a very big organization,

00:03:17.490 --> 00:03:18.770
you can opt for this one.

00:03:18.770 --> 00:03:19.530
Now,

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:21.300
what are the different features?

00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:26.210
Why've we are thinking that stigma is the next big thing?

00:03:26.210 --> 00:03:27.000
No.

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:31.040
The reason is that first thing is that it is a cross platform.

00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:35.200
You can use that design even in your browser.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:39.380
So this is the first thing Whenever you look at a design tool,

00:03:39.380 --> 00:03:44.850
you have to see whether it's it can be used anywhere on any platform.

00:03:44.850 --> 00:03:46.160
That is a plus.

00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:54.780
Point second is that there are a lot off tools that I can think that they are next

00:03:54.780 --> 00:03:56.670
generation tools for designers.

00:03:56.670 --> 00:04:01.100
There are a lot of things you can do a lot off features,

00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:04.530
but in this stole utterly hours,

00:04:04.530 --> 00:04:05.690
responsive designs.

00:04:05.690 --> 00:04:07.270
Then we have plug ins.

00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:13.570
You can see you can download different plug ins and extend the functionality off Sigma you

00:04:13.570 --> 00:04:14.400
can see over here.

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.700
Here we haven't splash,

00:04:15.700 --> 00:04:19.050
so you can download any image and its stock image that is free.

00:04:19.050 --> 00:04:20.160
Similarly,

00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:20.880
we have this,

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:21.930
I quantify,

00:04:21.930 --> 00:04:27.300
and you can use any different icons like material design icon Scougall icons.

00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:30.250
Four awesome icons that are very popular.

00:04:30.250 --> 00:04:34.160
So these are the features off Sigma,

00:04:34.160 --> 00:04:36.720
and this is how you are going to go over here.

00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:38.240
Sign up and down load fig,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:43.410
MMA desktop app and we're going to get started in the next lesson.

00:04:43.410 --> 00:04:46.150
So let's move on to the next lesson.
