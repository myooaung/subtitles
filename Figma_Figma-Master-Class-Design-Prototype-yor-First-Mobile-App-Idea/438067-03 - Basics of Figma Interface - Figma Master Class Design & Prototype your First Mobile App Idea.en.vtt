00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.650
now,

00:00:05.650 --> 00:00:07.670
Once you have downloaded fig mine,

00:00:07.670 --> 00:00:08.410
install it,

00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:09.680
you are going to run it.

00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.550
And the first screen you're going to see is this one.

00:00:12.550 --> 00:00:13.820
Now,

00:00:13.820 --> 00:00:14.500
in this lesson,

00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:17.550
we're going to get familiar with the interface off Sigma.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.650
So let's get started.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:20.390
Now.

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.060
The first thing you're going to see is this recent files.

00:00:23.060 --> 00:00:25.340
So you can see these are my recent files.

00:00:25.340 --> 00:00:27.490
You can arrange them alphabetically.

00:00:27.490 --> 00:00:28.210
Date created,

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:28.640
ascending,

00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:29.240
descending.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:32.830
You can change their view from this list.

00:00:32.830 --> 00:00:38.610
So this grid items and you can also see that there we have a plus sign over here.

00:00:38.610 --> 00:00:40.460
This is you are going toe,

00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:41.400
create a new file.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:42.730
So when you press this one,

00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:44.250
you're going to create a new file.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.070
This is the inboard files.

00:00:46.070 --> 00:00:47.590
If you are using sketch,

00:00:47.590 --> 00:00:50.240
you can import sketch file into figment.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:54.850
So this is the basics screen you're going to see.

00:00:54.850 --> 00:00:57.680
Then we have you been see or hear plug ins.

00:00:57.680 --> 00:00:59.910
So if you want to install some plug in,

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.110
for example,

00:01:01.110 --> 00:01:02.020
like this one,

00:01:02.020 --> 00:01:05.950
just click on install like this and it will be installed.

00:01:05.950 --> 00:01:09.650
So this is where your plug ins are.

00:01:09.650 --> 00:01:11.760
So these are all my install plug ins.

00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.530
Thes are few featured plug ins.

00:01:13.530 --> 00:01:17.000
You can browse plug ins and search them by name.

00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.740
So this is the plug in section recent Blufgan.

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:25.540
Then we have this such So you can search files,

00:01:25.540 --> 00:01:26.100
projects,

00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:26.540
people,

00:01:26.540 --> 00:01:27.370
whatever you want.

00:01:27.370 --> 00:01:29.050
We're here to like you can see.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:29.230
What?

00:01:29.230 --> 00:01:29.650
Here.

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:32.790
This is one of my project called practice.

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:36.170
So if I go back and type here practice,

00:01:36.170 --> 00:01:39.380
it would show me that we have one project by this name.

00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.690
So mostly it is from over here like this.

00:01:42.690 --> 00:01:46.400
So you have to switch to another dab to see what this project is.

00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:48.800
So this is,

00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:49.440
for example,

00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:52.250
if I teibel here like this,

00:01:52.250 --> 00:01:54.300
you can see it is a file.

00:01:54.300 --> 00:01:58.050
So this is the file jams app we're going to create in the schools.

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:01.950
You can see Fire founded and said that it's a file.

00:02:01.950 --> 00:02:03.980
Then we have this jobs.

00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:05.960
This is basically a project.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:12.120
So this is by de fired we whatever we're going to create it will be in the draft project

00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:14.910
and you can press this plus icon over here.

00:02:14.910 --> 00:02:16.900
All your diligent files are over here.

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:17.820
For example,

00:02:17.820 --> 00:02:21.400
you can see on similarly again.

00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:23.190
We have a new file icon,

00:02:23.190 --> 00:02:26.250
our hair and in we have an import file over here.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:28.650
So this is draft,

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:31.060
So there is a confusion.

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.690
So whenever you start using figment,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.950
you might be confused.

00:02:34.950 --> 00:02:36.550
What are different teams,

00:02:36.550 --> 00:02:40.730
but is project files frames.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:44.510
So I'm going to make sure that you don't get confused by this.

00:02:44.510 --> 00:02:48.050
So first we're going to study what it's fig ma hierarchy.

00:02:48.050 --> 00:02:49.560
So at the top,

00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.430
we have a team,

00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:51.380
for example,

00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:53.680
to people deemed three people team.

00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:57.950
There will be a team so you can create a team in Fig MMA.

00:02:57.950 --> 00:02:59.440
Then,

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.740
within that team,

00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:02.550
we have multiple projects,

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:03.640
maybe three.

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:04.710
For then,

00:03:04.710 --> 00:03:06.550
whatever the number is,

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:08.320
then,

00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:09.800
within those projects,

00:03:09.800 --> 00:03:10.900
with each project,

00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:15.190
we can have multiple files and in a file,

00:03:15.190 --> 00:03:18.440
we can have multiple pages off that file,

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:25.010
and then we can have a lot of different art boards or frames within a single page.

00:03:25.010 --> 00:03:27.550
So this is whole Sigma's hierarchy,

00:03:27.550 --> 00:03:31.570
so don't get confused with my project or file or pages.

00:03:31.570 --> 00:03:34.910
What are these different terms teams Within the team,

00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:37.540
you have projects on multiple projects,

00:03:37.540 --> 00:03:40.330
but in single project files within fires,

00:03:40.330 --> 00:03:41.820
you have pages within pages.

00:03:41.820 --> 00:03:44.350
You have a lot of art boards or frames.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:47.170
So this is a fig Mayes hierarchy.

00:03:47.170 --> 00:03:48.620
So let's get back.

00:03:48.620 --> 00:03:51.200
And we're going to click on this fig mike on over here,

00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:52.750
and you can see we're here.

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:53.450
This icon,

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:54.410
this is a team,

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:55.990
so you can see where here this is.

00:03:55.990 --> 00:03:56.810
Learn you excited,

00:03:56.810 --> 00:03:57.240
team.

00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.340
And if we click over here,

00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:00.590
we can have members.

00:04:00.590 --> 00:04:03.550
We can invited that members by clicking over here.

00:04:03.550 --> 00:04:07.700
We have different settings enabled libraries for all teams.

00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:08.100
Thes are,

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:08.680
I think,

00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:13.650
features for professional and other upgraded pricing models.

00:04:13.650 --> 00:04:14.650
So if you have tow,

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.880
you have to subscribe to $12 to get this.

00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:18.520
Yes,

00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:19.070
you can see what?

00:04:19.070 --> 00:04:19.250
Here.

00:04:19.250 --> 00:04:20.070
Upgrade plan.

00:04:20.070 --> 00:04:21.590
So they didn't.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:22.240
This team,

00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:23.240
this is my team.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.650
We have a project which is called practice.

00:04:26.650 --> 00:04:34.050
So we have this practice you can see or hear if I click over here and opened this project.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.100
Okay.

00:04:35.100 --> 00:04:37.450
So you can see it says practice.

00:04:37.450 --> 00:04:38.720
And within that practice,

00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.250
we have this file circular graph plus clock.

00:04:42.250 --> 00:04:45.340
So here we have different art boards.

00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.670
So if you go over here,

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:47.400
this is another.

00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:48.580
This is one Ardmore.

00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:49.650
You can see where here.

00:04:49.650 --> 00:04:51.150
This is another one.

00:04:51.150 --> 00:04:55.910
One more thing is that if you want toe change the background color,

00:04:55.910 --> 00:04:56.660
for example,

00:04:56.660 --> 00:04:58.590
or hear the background color is great.

00:04:58.590 --> 00:05:05.830
So just UNSA lacked or disliked any off the art board you have selected or frames you have

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:06.300
selected.

00:05:06.300 --> 00:05:07.150
Go over here,

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:08.480
for example.

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:13.310
Click on this empty background and you can see here we have background color so you can

00:05:13.310 --> 00:05:16.160
change the background color to something like this.

00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:26.690
So this is how you are going to Jane some off the things within fig MMA and then we have

00:05:26.690 --> 00:05:27.490
over here.

00:05:27.490 --> 00:05:29.330
Over here we have share controls.

00:05:29.330 --> 00:05:30.630
You can share your files,

00:05:30.630 --> 00:05:32.840
you can play your prototype.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.510
So if you want to present it,

00:05:34.510 --> 00:05:35.900
you're going to click over here.

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.260
Similarly,

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.550
we have this zoom in,

00:05:38.550 --> 00:05:41.600
zoom out all different zoom 200%.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.850
So this is 100%.

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:44.070
This is,

00:05:44.070 --> 00:05:45.930
uh these are few things over here.

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:48.730
Then we again have some manual here color space.

00:05:48.730 --> 00:05:50.580
We're going to use s RGB.

00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:52.740
So if you have settled toe unmanaged,

00:05:52.740 --> 00:05:54.310
try to click on S rgb.

00:05:54.310 --> 00:05:57.880
So this is really necessary.

00:05:57.880 --> 00:05:59.930
If you are designing for digital devices,

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:03.190
you are going to use as RGB color space.

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.620
We again have Blufgan.

00:06:05.620 --> 00:06:06.410
Zor here.

00:06:06.410 --> 00:06:07.480
New window.

00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.990
New file open draws violent browser.

00:06:09.990 --> 00:06:10.900
Different options.

00:06:10.900 --> 00:06:12.850
Check for updates about Sigma.

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:16.450
So this is the right side.

00:06:16.450 --> 00:06:17.920
And if we go over here,

00:06:17.920 --> 00:06:20.090
this is our search.

00:06:20.090 --> 00:06:23.870
You can click over here and you will have another menu here file.

00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:29.060
And it you object Director dext range plug ins,

00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:31.900
integrations preferences,

00:06:31.900 --> 00:06:32.980
different settings.

00:06:32.980 --> 00:06:37.350
Libraries that are basically designed libraries you can share with your team.

00:06:37.350 --> 00:06:39.500
And this is your account settings.

00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:41.740
And on the top on the left,

00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:43.100
you can have different.

00:06:43.100 --> 00:06:45.570
You have different tools over here.

00:06:45.570 --> 00:06:46.110
For example,

00:06:46.110 --> 00:06:47.140
this text,

00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:48.790
this comment tool,

00:06:48.790 --> 00:06:51.220
you can use it to commend on different projects.

00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.350
This is handled to move like this.

00:06:53.350 --> 00:06:56.910
So we are going toe go deep into these tools.

00:06:56.910 --> 00:06:58.630
Don't worry right now.

00:06:58.630 --> 00:07:04.370
Just get familiar with the interface that on here we have different tools like move scale.

00:07:04.370 --> 00:07:09.810
The's are our art boards or frames.

00:07:09.810 --> 00:07:10.540
Over here,

00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:11.680
they call them frames.

00:07:11.680 --> 00:07:13.600
So if you want to create a new frame,

00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:16.930
you're going to click over here and you will see different frame sizes over here.

00:07:16.930 --> 00:07:18.000
Tablet Foon.

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:19.150
Okay.

00:07:19.150 --> 00:07:20.610
Similarly,

00:07:20.610 --> 00:07:22.000
we have all these tools,

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.720
and if we go.

00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:23.700
Want to go back?

00:07:23.700 --> 00:07:28.870
We're going to click on the stick Mike on and we're going to go back on where we started.

00:07:28.870 --> 00:07:31.390
If you want to create a new team,

00:07:31.390 --> 00:07:35.010
you are goingto click over here at the bottom left and new team.

00:07:35.010 --> 00:07:36.780
And,

00:07:36.780 --> 00:07:38.110
for example,

00:07:38.110 --> 00:07:44.190
I create you X team off that's used this UX team.

00:07:44.190 --> 00:07:47.350
So let's see if it let me create a team or not.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:50.650
So you can add different collaborators over here,

00:07:50.650 --> 00:07:56.860
so I might have three or four different collaborators or people that are going to work with

00:07:56.860 --> 00:07:57.990
the steam over here.

00:07:57.990 --> 00:08:03.300
And right now I can skip and you can see or hear choose your team plans.

00:08:03.300 --> 00:08:09.600
So that is why I said that it is going toe ask you for upgradation because you can create

00:08:09.600 --> 00:08:11.770
one team in the free version.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:15.250
So this is how you can create a team.

00:08:15.250 --> 00:08:16.690
Now,

00:08:16.690 --> 00:08:20.800
if you are a Mac user and you're using fig MMA on a Mac,

00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:27.670
then the only difference between the interface is that you will see the menu bar at the top

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:27.670
.

00:08:27.670 --> 00:08:33.050
So whenever you open up phlegm A in your Mac computer or Mac laptop,

00:08:33.050 --> 00:08:37.550
you're going to have this menu bar over here.

00:08:37.550 --> 00:08:41.030
So the same thing is over here.

00:08:41.030 --> 00:08:45.650
If you want to change the color space and different things are going to be over here.

00:08:45.650 --> 00:08:50.890
So that is the only difference between Sigma's interface for Windows and Mac.

00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:56.070
I think that is all about the interferes off this Ah fig model.

00:08:56.070 --> 00:08:59.690
Make sure you remember this hierarchy Team projects,

00:08:59.690 --> 00:09:02.110
filed speeches and framed in our ports.

00:09:02.110 --> 00:09:05.570
I hope you have got familiar with Sigma's interface.

00:09:05.570 --> 00:09:07.560
Now let's move on to the next lesson.
