00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.830
in this video of,

00:00:05.830 --> 00:00:11.360
we're going to talk about a very nice feature off Rick marriages called team libraries so

00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.350
you can share your you can see or hear textiles.

00:00:14.350 --> 00:00:17.550
Color strives on your fact styles,

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:19.870
along with your all the components.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:21.820
So whenever I design,

00:00:21.820 --> 00:00:23.350
I actually are designing.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:26.590
Mostly I designed in a design page,

00:00:26.590 --> 00:00:29.220
so I have a separate page for style guide.

00:00:29.220 --> 00:00:30.350
So in this page,

00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.870
I normally have all the components,

00:00:32.870 --> 00:00:34.670
all different icons,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.750
which are already components.

00:00:36.750 --> 00:00:43.120
So I'm going to share with you how toe actually manage your team library and how you can

00:00:43.120 --> 00:00:47.850
update it and how this update will reflect to your other team members.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:54.900
So it's It is basically collaboration kind off designed library sharing where you can share

00:00:54.900 --> 00:00:59.150
all your company and sell your styles you have created in your project.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:05.000
So other designers can easily pick them up and use them in other screens.

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.530
So what you have to do is whatever your main components are.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:09.040
For example,

00:01:09.040 --> 00:01:10.700
you can see bottom navigation.

00:01:10.700 --> 00:01:12.070
This is actually a component,

00:01:12.070 --> 00:01:18.910
and it's instance I actually keep all my master components into this style guide.

00:01:18.910 --> 00:01:20.890
So in the style guide,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.300
you can see.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.290
We have all the components we have logo,

00:01:23.290 --> 00:01:24.260
small logo,

00:01:24.260 --> 00:01:26.000
big logo than we have.

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.930
Different meant this diet plan chips,

00:01:29.930 --> 00:01:32.540
and then we have different buttons than we have.

00:01:32.540 --> 00:01:33.510
Search bar.

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:34.920
These are navigations.

00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:38.760
So what we're going to do is we can create different frames,

00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:39.630
for example,

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:40.510
or this one.

00:01:40.510 --> 00:01:44.250
I'm going to call it Navigation Navigation.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:51.380
So now what I'm going to do is we don't need on this one.

00:01:51.380 --> 00:01:55.140
So this one is not in the navigation.

00:01:55.140 --> 00:01:56.960
This is actually navigation.

00:01:56.960 --> 00:01:59.290
This is actually a navigation.

00:01:59.290 --> 00:02:00.320
And,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:01.050
um,

00:02:01.050 --> 00:02:03.370
this is not navigation.

00:02:03.370 --> 00:02:04.680
This is outside of this.

00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:06.850
This is also outside.

00:02:06.850 --> 00:02:11.150
So I am going to separate them in tow,

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.490
different categories.

00:02:13.490 --> 00:02:17.400
So I'm actually managing them in different art boards.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:19.250
Or you can call them frames.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:22.350
So navigation is going to be over here.

00:02:22.350 --> 00:02:24.310
So whatever is in the navigation,

00:02:24.310 --> 00:02:27.150
it is going to stay over here.

00:02:27.150 --> 00:02:28.400
Similarly,

00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.050
I'm going toe create another frame A or F G.

00:02:32.050 --> 00:02:35.450
And here I have I'm going to call it,

00:02:35.450 --> 00:02:37.070
um,

00:02:37.070 --> 00:02:40.990
buttons and and controls.

00:02:40.990 --> 00:02:43.970
So over here,

00:02:43.970 --> 00:02:49.600
I'm going to drag My both pretends my such bar because it is a control item.

00:02:49.600 --> 00:02:52.080
These are Okay,

00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:52.850
selects,

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:54.450
move them over here too.

00:02:54.450 --> 00:02:57.350
And other than that,

00:02:57.350 --> 00:03:00.040
I think this is going to be okay.

00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:02.450
So now we're going to create another frame.

00:03:02.450 --> 00:03:05.410
Let's call it,

00:03:05.410 --> 00:03:08.350
um um,

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:15.310
arrested be guards and items.

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:22.550
So here we are going to use all these options that are going to be inside the recipe.

00:03:22.550 --> 00:03:24.800
Thistles.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:26.230
Also going to be recipe.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:29.140
This is actually related to search.

00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:30.250
Let's move them.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:36.990
Let's I'm going to move them in the burdens section over here because these are pins,

00:03:36.990 --> 00:03:38.450
so we're going to use them.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.170
Um,

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:41.450
okay,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:43.290
so here we have one card,

00:03:43.290 --> 00:03:45.440
one big recipe card over here,

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.110
so I'm going to expand this art board next.

00:03:49.110 --> 00:03:50.650
Move them over here,

00:03:50.650 --> 00:03:53.480
Make this art board a big,

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.280
more bigger like this.

00:03:59.280 --> 00:04:02.600
Then we have this big recipe,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.350
this one small recipe,

00:04:05.350 --> 00:04:11.650
then we have this card on.

00:04:11.650 --> 00:04:15.150
Then we have the step recipe step preparing a recipe.

00:04:15.150 --> 00:04:18.870
So we have different components over here.

00:04:18.870 --> 00:04:20.280
Similarly again.

00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.050
If you want to keep your logo,

00:04:22.050 --> 00:04:24.880
so are I'm going to call them.

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:28.090
Let's create in that are bored or frame.

00:04:28.090 --> 00:04:29.950
And I'm going to call it,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.850
um go,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.600
go and icons.

00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:43.450
So I'm going to grab all my logos and icons and drag them over here like this.

00:04:43.450 --> 00:04:46.970
These are few icons.

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:47.280
Actually.

00:04:47.280 --> 00:04:51.270
You can create a whole bundle of five counts over here.

00:04:51.270 --> 00:04:56.090
So I'm actually creating Let's make this a regular here.

00:04:56.090 --> 00:05:02.540
And now I'm going to just re sizing my art boards.

00:05:02.540 --> 00:05:03.440
Nothing else.

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.750
Nothing fancy.

00:05:04.750 --> 00:05:11.370
These are My icons were here and my local and I'm going toe.

00:05:11.370 --> 00:05:12.580
Keep them like this.

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:18.500
Okay,

00:05:18.500 --> 00:05:22.450
So once I have created on managed this style guide,

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:26.750
you have to go toe assets and you can see over here.

00:05:26.750 --> 00:05:27.600
These are called,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:29.350
but and then we have If we,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:30.550
um,

00:05:30.550 --> 00:05:32.410
open this buttons and controls,

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.280
we have different buttons and controls.

00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.950
Then we have logos.

00:05:35.950 --> 00:05:40.450
I think this one suits better into the recipe section over here.

00:05:40.450 --> 00:05:41.480
And one more thing,

00:05:41.480 --> 00:05:47.730
if you want to change the background color a little bit something else because it is easier

00:05:47.730 --> 00:05:49.800
to see white backgrounds over here.

00:05:49.800 --> 00:05:50.340
Similarly,

00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:51.250
for this one,

00:05:51.250 --> 00:05:57.750
I'm going to use a little bit Gresh red collateral here.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:05:58.770
Similarly,

00:05:58.770 --> 00:05:59.560
for this one,

00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:01.290
I'm going to go with this.

00:06:01.290 --> 00:06:05.150
And also for this fun,

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:10.550
just to make sure that everything is visible easily,

00:06:10.550 --> 00:06:12.130
Uh,

00:06:12.130 --> 00:06:15.450
Let's make it smaller like this.

00:06:15.450 --> 00:06:18.610
Okay,

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:20.140
so we have managed everything.

00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:21.380
If we go toe assets,

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.050
you can see we have different categories.

00:06:23.050 --> 00:06:25.600
Locals and navigation is easier toe.

00:06:25.600 --> 00:06:27.080
You reuse them.

00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:28.030
No.

00:06:28.030 --> 00:06:30.650
Once you have organized all your styles,

00:06:30.650 --> 00:06:36.940
your components you have to click on this team library icon in this assets panel moved to

00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:37.090
oh,

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:39.250
this assets panel and click on this one.

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:45.070
Now you can see I have this fig Mahfoud AB you can click on Publish and we are going toe.

00:06:45.070 --> 00:06:45.910
Call them.

00:06:45.910 --> 00:06:47.950
Let's call them full.

00:06:47.950 --> 00:06:54.170
Now you can see it is publishing library.

00:06:54.170 --> 00:07:00.150
It is showing me that it is going to publish this successfully published library updates.

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:01.010
Now,

00:07:01.010 --> 00:07:02.430
once you have published your style,

00:07:02.430 --> 00:07:04.050
you can go back to Sigma.

00:07:04.050 --> 00:07:08.020
So here we have this stigma a stigma gas,

00:07:08.020 --> 00:07:09.010
which is our learned,

00:07:09.010 --> 00:07:09.800
You exciting.

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:12.950
And now I'm going to create a new file over here.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:15.170
So let's create a new file.

00:07:15.170 --> 00:07:21.750
Untitled and I'm going toe open this one untitled and I'm going to create a frame.

00:07:21.750 --> 00:07:23.950
And if I moved assets,

00:07:23.950 --> 00:07:27.950
you can see if we have a tab over here to create a component sector Lear.

00:07:27.950 --> 00:07:32.200
So for that we're going to explore our libraries.

00:07:32.200 --> 00:07:34.150
So I'm going to click over here,

00:07:34.150 --> 00:07:38.850
and I'm going toe done this on for this file.

00:07:38.850 --> 00:07:41.300
So once I have turned this on,

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:44.830
you can see I can have access to all the buttons.

00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:46.300
Everything we have over here.

00:07:46.300 --> 00:07:47.240
For example,

00:07:47.240 --> 00:07:53.950
this button next drag things chip over here on this such bar over here.

00:07:53.950 --> 00:07:57.390
So I can use all these components.

00:07:57.390 --> 00:07:58.180
Similarly,

00:07:58.180 --> 00:07:59.300
if I try to create,

00:07:59.300 --> 00:07:59.920
for example,

00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:03.150
and tangle over here and I want toe access,

00:08:03.150 --> 00:08:06.480
the colors you can see we have all the colors over here.

00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:07.720
So these are my style,

00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:08.270
for example,

00:08:08.270 --> 00:08:09.350
disc radiant cream.

00:08:09.350 --> 00:08:11.950
So I can access all my styles,

00:08:11.950 --> 00:08:14.210
all my buttons,

00:08:14.210 --> 00:08:17.710
all my components,

00:08:17.710 --> 00:08:18.280
for example,

00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:20.940
Here we if we call it a recipe card components,

00:08:20.940 --> 00:08:23.950
you can see I have all these components.

00:08:23.950 --> 00:08:24.490
For example,

00:08:24.490 --> 00:08:25.000
this one.

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000
I can drag it over here and use it like this.

00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.960
So all of my other designers,

00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:35.990
they can just drag and drop inside this a team,

00:08:35.990 --> 00:08:36.660
for example,

00:08:36.660 --> 00:08:41.450
we have Let's go back and you can see this is our team learned you exciting.

00:08:41.450 --> 00:08:46.100
So I have created Theis style guide in this team.

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:49.650
So I have are just operated education team plan.

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:56.660
So they let me create this this design system on this design style guides that can be

00:08:56.660 --> 00:08:58.760
shared with other team members.

00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.000
So now you can see this was my project.

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:05.700
And if I create any other team member,

00:09:05.700 --> 00:09:06.230
for example,

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:07.330
this far more we're here.

00:09:07.330 --> 00:09:12.150
If she opens up a new document or she tries to add something over here,

00:09:12.150 --> 00:09:15.920
she can easily access this whole design.

00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:16.590
And for example,

00:09:16.590 --> 00:09:17.060
legs.

00:09:17.060 --> 00:09:18.680
This is local.

00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:23.650
So you can see we can also access our textiles.

00:09:23.650 --> 00:09:24.210
For example,

00:09:24.210 --> 00:09:26.450
If I try to write something over here,

00:09:26.450 --> 00:09:28.450
let's go.

00:09:28.450 --> 00:09:32.240
And now you can see if I go over here.

00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:33.820
I have textiles for food,

00:09:33.820 --> 00:09:39.270
fig map so I can switch to this one or I can switch to this one.

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:40.310
For example,

00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:41.640
this one you can see we're here.

00:09:41.640 --> 00:09:47.960
I can also switch to any deck style you have so you can see over here we have different

00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:51.680
textiles so you can switch toe any textile.

00:09:51.680 --> 00:09:52.940
And if you want to change,

00:09:52.940 --> 00:09:54.750
go to the definition toe a.

00:09:54.750 --> 00:09:55.430
Get this.

00:09:55.430 --> 00:10:00.050
So if I go over here and if I change something in this style guide over here,

00:10:00.050 --> 00:10:01.840
for example.

00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:06.050
Let's Jane something over here,

00:10:06.050 --> 00:10:09.850
for example,

00:10:09.850 --> 00:10:10.260
this one.

00:10:10.260 --> 00:10:16.040
So I'm going to change the right off this one so you can see as soon as I change something

00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:20.850
it says Publish publisher changes to your team libraries if I click on publish.

00:10:20.850 --> 00:10:22.100
Um,

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:24.890
weird changed.

00:10:24.890 --> 00:10:28.650
So I'm going to update my publish library that I have changed this thing.

00:10:28.650 --> 00:10:30.250
Publish Over here.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:34.550
And now if I goto this over here,

00:10:34.550 --> 00:10:36.110
okay?

00:10:36.110 --> 00:10:42.660
And I try to use this one so it was already operated.

00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.090
Let's change it again.

00:10:45.090 --> 00:10:45.750
Over here.

00:10:45.750 --> 00:10:47.140
Let's change it again.

00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:53.080
So I'm going toe Just move them inside in the middle like this.

00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:55.560
I smoked him in the middle.

00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:57.950
So let's publish the changes again.

00:10:57.950 --> 00:11:01.650
Okay?

00:11:01.650 --> 00:11:02.290
So,

00:11:02.290 --> 00:11:02.530
no,

00:11:02.530 --> 00:11:03.360
If I go over here,

00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:06.620
you can see it says that component subjects are available,

00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:10.450
so if I can dismiss it or I can reviewed So if you click on review,

00:11:10.450 --> 00:11:12.440
it says you have to update it.

00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:14.090
So if I try to update,

00:11:14.090 --> 00:11:18.150
you can see it is going toe update the alignment offered.

00:11:18.150 --> 00:11:20.920
So let me show you one more update,

00:11:20.920 --> 00:11:26.230
so you can easily see view it so Let's change its color to something else.

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:27.570
Let's use this,

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:28.970
uh,

00:11:28.970 --> 00:11:34.250
this orange color just toe demonstrate that I have changed a killer.

00:11:34.250 --> 00:11:36.180
How?

00:11:36.180 --> 00:11:37.940
Actually the steam libraries work.

00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:39.050
So here I am,

00:11:39.050 --> 00:11:40.180
trying toe use.

00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.250
This one and new one is actually this orange one,

00:11:43.250 --> 00:11:45.280
so I have to review it.

00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:51.600
I have to update it and you can see it has been updated to this orange one.

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:56.000
So this is how you actually share libraries with your team members.

00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.750
You can share your components.

00:11:57.750 --> 00:11:59.240
You can share your whole style,

00:11:59.240 --> 00:12:00.760
guide your style,

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.340
your buttons,

00:12:01.340 --> 00:12:03.350
your components with your team members.

00:12:03.350 --> 00:12:07.590
And this is how you actually manage them into different frames toe.

00:12:07.590 --> 00:12:08.910
Name them properly.

00:12:08.910 --> 00:12:10.700
So when someone access them,

00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:11.750
you can see we're here.

00:12:11.750 --> 00:12:14.480
Someone access them.

00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:15.670
They have different categories,

00:12:15.670 --> 00:12:17.290
so they can easily drag them up.

00:12:17.290 --> 00:12:18.690
So you have to move.

00:12:18.690 --> 00:12:20.120
Whenever you create a new file,

00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.910
you have to move to assets and try to use trying to turn on third this library.

00:12:25.910 --> 00:12:27.400
So if I turned on this one,

00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:31.450
you can see I can also access the personal colors library.

00:12:31.450 --> 00:12:34.450
So that's cleared a rectangle.

00:12:34.450 --> 00:12:37.150
And if I go over here,

00:12:37.150 --> 00:12:39.480
you can see here we have freak Mahfoud app,

00:12:39.480 --> 00:12:41.850
the new exciting colors and personal colors.

00:12:41.850 --> 00:12:44.600
So these are all different libraries,

00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:46.110
these director team libraries.

00:12:46.110 --> 00:12:48.680
I can access in tow any project.

00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:51.830
So I hope you have enjoyed this team library lesson.

00:12:51.830 --> 00:12:56.650
If you have any problems or if you are stuck some somewhere,

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:00.110
you can always ask me a question or started discussion.

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:02.060
Let's move on to the next lesson.
