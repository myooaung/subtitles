WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
Now we have created the search,

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.980
any mission and prototype it.

00:00:07.980 --> 00:00:11.050
Now we are going toe move to the next screen,

00:00:11.050 --> 00:00:13.440
which is going to be the search results.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:21.890
So let's call it such reserves and you can see or hear.

00:00:21.890 --> 00:00:28.050
We are going to have some status over here like we have found these many reserves that's

00:00:28.050 --> 00:00:29.650
delete this next.

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:30.510
Dilute this.

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:34.400
So I'm keeping this because I need to show it.

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:38.750
Five reserves phone.

00:00:38.750 --> 00:00:43.550
So I'm going to keep this same top section over here,

00:00:43.550 --> 00:00:49.740
and we are going toe change the color to some great like this because we don't want it to

00:00:49.740 --> 00:00:51.160
be very highlighted over here.

00:00:51.160 --> 00:00:54.650
And now we're going to create a rectangle overhead.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:00:58.760
So rectangle is going to be the same size as this such bar.

00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:11.070
Over here it is 3 39 3 39 and let's keep the height 1 24 and we are going toe lying in like

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:11.750
this.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:16.570
It is going to be 20 pixels far away from the stop reserves,

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.680
and we are going to have some rounded corners,

00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:23.050
four full excrete.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:32.590
That's enable our So it is a bit outside off outside of Fallar section over here.

00:01:32.590 --> 00:01:32.790
Okay,

00:01:32.790 --> 00:01:33.850
so this looks scored.

00:01:33.850 --> 00:01:36.680
Okay,

00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:37.050
so,

00:01:37.050 --> 00:01:38.290
no,

00:01:38.290 --> 00:01:39.550
this is our starting point.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.830
So I'm going to hide my,

00:01:41.830 --> 00:01:42.830
uh,

00:01:42.830 --> 00:01:47.630
out grade command control Shift four and control G.

00:01:47.630 --> 00:01:50.180
I think for Mac users,

00:01:50.180 --> 00:01:52.200
I'm going to use white color.

00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:58.610
So now you can see why I have used this white because white looks create on this pale and

00:01:58.610 --> 00:02:00.810
finish background.

00:02:00.810 --> 00:02:01.840
So this is a trick.

00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:07.510
I wanted to show you that if you try to use some very light colored or very light teamed

00:02:07.510 --> 00:02:08.680
background,

00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.860
your white color is going to shine on it.

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:13.800
So now we're going to add some shadow,

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:14.300
this one.

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:16.760
So we're going to go toe effects.

00:02:16.760 --> 00:02:21.040
Drop shadow and blood will be three five.

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:22.290
Any will be one.

00:02:22.290 --> 00:02:24.820
Because we don't want it to be very far away.

00:02:24.820 --> 00:02:30.490
And the color in with 363636 And the opacity will be 10%.

00:02:30.490 --> 00:02:32.680
You can see it is very subtle.

00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:33.130
Shadowed.

00:02:33.130 --> 00:02:33.830
Resume in.

00:02:33.830 --> 00:02:35.430
You can see this is very,

00:02:35.430 --> 00:02:36.710
very light shadow,

00:02:36.710 --> 00:02:38.290
and it looks really great.

00:02:38.290 --> 00:02:40.150
It is very close to this layer,

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.880
and this looks great.

00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:47.110
Now we're going to add an image over here on the left and on the right,

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:48.790
we will have some off the information,

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.250
like milk gig or something like that.

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.670
So first we are going toe.

00:02:53.670 --> 00:02:56.480
This is going to be our Dana.

00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.750
And now we're going to add another container inside this one.

00:03:01.750 --> 00:03:06.550
So it will be over here like this.

00:03:06.550 --> 00:03:10.590
This is going to contain our image.

00:03:10.590 --> 00:03:15.230
No.

00:03:15.230 --> 00:03:20.610
What we want to do is we want to have this container to act as our mosque for all this.

00:03:20.610 --> 00:03:26.350
So we are going to replicate this command control D and we're going to slack this container

00:03:26.350 --> 00:03:27.690
a mosque.

00:03:27.690 --> 00:03:28.640
We have been to rename it,

00:03:28.640 --> 00:03:30.450
contain a mosque in the background,

00:03:30.450 --> 00:03:33.430
and we are going toe slept.

00:03:33.430 --> 00:03:38.320
All the top players we want inside it and we're going to use this mosque or here.

00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:40.390
Now you can see all these leaders.

00:03:40.390 --> 00:03:42.250
They cannot escape this size.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:44.010
So if I try to resize it,

00:03:44.010 --> 00:03:46.950
you can see it will always stay over here in this.

00:03:46.950 --> 00:03:52.150
One more thing is that I think our shadow is lost over here.

00:03:52.150 --> 00:03:56.130
So let's move this from this,

00:03:56.130 --> 00:03:59.850
and we're going to add it to our mosque group.

00:03:59.850 --> 00:04:02.850
So let's add the shared over here.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:13.550
The one 3 66 and we are going to use 10% of it here.

00:04:13.550 --> 00:04:15.870
So this looks work.

00:04:15.870 --> 00:04:16.750
This looks good.

00:04:16.750 --> 00:04:19.950
So we have this next caller image container,

00:04:19.950 --> 00:04:24.650
and we're going to drag and drop over image inside this one.

00:04:24.650 --> 00:04:29.810
Let's use this and fill this with image over here,

00:04:29.810 --> 00:04:34.250
like this image and expose the image.

00:04:34.250 --> 00:04:35.800
And these are the images.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:36.950
They expect this one.

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.720
Okay,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:40.950
so this is looking good.

00:04:40.950 --> 00:04:42.060
This is looking good.

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:42.900
Great.

00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:44.360
Okay,

00:04:44.360 --> 00:04:47.550
So we we need to have some information or here.

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:53.210
So in Michigan dinner,

00:04:53.210 --> 00:04:54.770
we have the image inside it.

00:04:54.770 --> 00:04:56.640
Then we have this container.

00:04:56.640 --> 00:04:58.580
This is going to be the full white container.

00:04:58.580 --> 00:05:01.250
Let's call it continue light.

00:05:01.250 --> 00:05:03.560
And then we have continued mosque,

00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.690
which is actually masking everything.

00:05:05.690 --> 00:05:06.610
Okay,

00:05:06.610 --> 00:05:09.220
so now we're going to add something over here,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.650
like milk kick.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.840
This is going to be our title.

00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.250
Okay,

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:19.270
so we want to have good separation from this image.

00:05:19.270 --> 00:05:20.410
Let's move it inside.

00:05:20.410 --> 00:05:27.060
This lost group 2120 s good from the top.

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:28.380
Excuse 12.

00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:36.350
Then we will have something else like 5 36 People love it.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:40.390
We will also have review over here,

00:05:40.390 --> 00:05:46.700
so we will use 251 reviews and stars.

00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:49.050
So we're going to use a star shape over here,

00:05:49.050 --> 00:05:53.050
create a star shift or shift.

00:05:53.050 --> 00:05:56.010
I'm going to use some other angle,

00:05:56.010 --> 00:05:57.000
like 45.

00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:57.760
This looks scored.

00:05:57.760 --> 00:06:02.890
And I'm going to use an orange color over here like this one.

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:05.580
A bit brighter would look better.

00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:10.810
Like this size will be next year's 12.

00:06:10.810 --> 00:06:12.250
This looks good.

00:06:12.250 --> 00:06:20.050
Not just We need to replicate these.

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.920
Come on,

00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:22.390
De.

00:06:22.390 --> 00:06:22.790
Come on,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:23.060
D.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:28.290
Now,

00:06:28.290 --> 00:06:33.760
I'm going to use some of the gentleman of because most of these selections you can see over

00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:35.050
here if you go over here.

00:06:35.050 --> 00:06:36.400
This one,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:38.580
This has Arabic.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.750
I'm going to use in some out of 16.

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:41.880
Similarly,

00:06:41.880 --> 00:06:42.510
over here,

00:06:42.510 --> 00:06:45.650
I'm going to use your strawman of 16.

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:48.700
And the color will be the same.

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.370
Like this one.

00:06:50.370 --> 00:06:51.660
A little bit create.

00:06:51.660 --> 00:06:52.650
Similarly,

00:06:52.650 --> 00:06:53.250
for this one,

00:06:53.250 --> 00:06:54.950
I'm going to use it and gentleman.

00:06:54.950 --> 00:07:21.820
And let's group all of the's okay for this one,

00:07:21.820 --> 00:07:23.370
we're not going to use this black,

00:07:23.370 --> 00:07:24.950
but we have a green black.

00:07:24.950 --> 00:07:27.590
So we're going to use this one similarly,

00:07:27.590 --> 00:07:28.150
for this one.

00:07:28.150 --> 00:07:30.840
We don't want it to be very bright.

00:07:30.840 --> 00:07:37.280
Let's maybe we can use this green primary color because reviews are very You can see

00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.060
menting off any app People love to read them.

00:07:42.060 --> 00:07:48.380
So this is almost ready that zoom out and see how are different distances.

00:07:48.380 --> 00:07:49.240
This,

00:07:49.240 --> 00:07:49.490
uh,

00:07:49.490 --> 00:07:51.090
this one looks a bit smaller,

00:07:51.090 --> 00:07:55.650
so I'm going toe increase the size express and hold shift.

00:07:55.650 --> 00:07:56.680
Okay,

00:07:56.680 --> 00:07:58.750
so this one looks looks better now.

00:07:58.750 --> 00:08:02.660
Nurse line left sites.

00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:02.940
OK,

00:08:02.940 --> 00:08:10.510
so so here we have the distance off to She used this.

00:08:10.510 --> 00:08:14.650
Move them a little bit up because it is very close to the border over here.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.030
Okay,

00:08:16.030 --> 00:08:18.350
So once we have created this mosque group,

00:08:18.350 --> 00:08:20.750
this is actually our,

00:08:20.750 --> 00:08:22.100
um,

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:24.850
such result.

00:08:24.850 --> 00:08:28.470
Or maybe we can small card.

00:08:28.470 --> 00:08:29.950
We can call a small card.

00:08:29.950 --> 00:08:31.040
Now,

00:08:31.040 --> 00:08:32.530
we're going to replicate this one.

00:08:32.530 --> 00:08:34.260
If you want to create a component,

00:08:34.260 --> 00:08:35.380
you can also do that.

00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:38.650
So I'm going toe shift some of the things here and there,

00:08:38.650 --> 00:08:42.350
and then I'm going to move it.

00:08:42.350 --> 00:08:46.950
Let's make this a component.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:50.260
Command Control.

00:08:50.260 --> 00:08:50.660
Deterred.

00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:51.350
Replicate.

00:08:51.350 --> 00:08:52.070
I'm using.

00:08:52.070 --> 00:08:55.320
I'm going to move this Theis component,

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:57.800
this master component to our style guide.

00:08:57.800 --> 00:09:01.660
So let's Harrod or here like this.

00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:07.580
Now we're going to replicate and just change the images and the tax.

00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:08.500
So I'm going toe.

00:09:08.500 --> 00:09:10.490
I'm not going to go into detail.

00:09:10.490 --> 00:09:11.630
This is going to be skip.

00:09:11.630 --> 00:09:13.320
I'm going to skip it very fast.

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:13.320
-

00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:50.220
No

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:50.220
,

00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:51.130
the screen is ready.

00:09:51.130 --> 00:09:52.070
You can see over here.

00:09:52.070 --> 00:09:54.160
I have changed all the different items over here,

00:09:54.160 --> 00:09:56.340
and I have left some space over here at the bottom.

00:09:56.340 --> 00:09:57.790
So whenever we school,

00:09:57.790 --> 00:10:01.220
we have the space for this bottom navigation,

00:10:01.220 --> 00:10:01.650
or here.

00:10:01.650 --> 00:10:05.710
So now we're going to link these items over here.

00:10:05.710 --> 00:10:08.750
So once use like this and click on search,

00:10:08.750 --> 00:10:09.960
it should go on.

00:10:09.960 --> 00:10:11.550
This search is er speech.

00:10:11.550 --> 00:10:13.350
So let's do that.

00:10:13.350 --> 00:10:18.280
So we're going to select this icon,

00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:26.960
and we also need to add some rectangle over here tohave the tap active area like this.

00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:33.150
And it is going to be this is going to be near this such bar.

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:42.850
Tap a DEA,

00:10:42.850 --> 00:10:52.400
screw them together on weekend.

00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.000
If we don't want a group,

00:10:54.000 --> 00:11:01.070
we can leave it like this step idea for such like this.

00:11:01.070 --> 00:11:04.570
And then we're going to use the opacity to 0%.

00:11:04.570 --> 00:11:11.980
And once we go toe prototype were going toe slept the same This tab 80 over here and going

00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:12.520
to move it.

00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:14.750
So this one is in any made.

00:11:14.750 --> 00:11:18.110
So let's try to see what we have accomplished.

00:11:18.110 --> 00:11:18.850
Still yet.

00:11:18.850 --> 00:11:22.510
So all your diet rate Next,

00:11:22.510 --> 00:11:25.470
click over here and here we have our results.

00:11:25.470 --> 00:11:25.780
Now,

00:11:25.780 --> 00:11:27.560
if you want to Any made these deserves,

00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.600
that's a different story.

00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:31.620
We have toe use the same reserves you can see.

00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:31.980
Okay,

00:11:31.980 --> 00:11:34.670
so this is a bit problem.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.480
We're here.

00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:39.560
We have a lot of space at the bottom because off you things over here.

00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:42.710
So let me show you what actually happens.

00:11:42.710 --> 00:11:45.710
So whenever you have something like this,

00:11:45.710 --> 00:11:48.850
you need to have clip content.

00:11:48.850 --> 00:11:50.890
And for this image,

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:52.740
we want toe resident Phil,

00:11:52.740 --> 00:11:54.250
we're goingto go toe crop.

00:11:54.250 --> 00:11:57.650
You can see this boundary is outside of this area.

00:11:57.650 --> 00:12:02.740
So whenever you have this but this kind of boundary this is going toe give more space at

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:03.250
the bottom.

00:12:03.250 --> 00:12:11.600
So we are going to use crop and call.

00:12:11.600 --> 00:12:18.460
It is going to fix that and also you can see over here what is happening.

00:12:18.460 --> 00:12:20.750
So BG background is a bit larger.

00:12:20.750 --> 00:12:22.560
This is another problem.

00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:28.440
So make sure your your layers are not getting outside of this container so If any layer is

00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:29.630
outside of this container,

00:12:29.630 --> 00:12:30.520
it is going toe.

00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.950
Give you some headaches like that.

00:12:32.950 --> 00:12:33.900
Okay,

00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:35.510
So before going to this one,

00:12:35.510 --> 00:12:40.550
we need to animate these for so we are going to select all of them.

00:12:40.550 --> 00:12:41.980
Come on,

00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:42.420
See?

00:12:42.420 --> 00:12:44.650
And we are going toe base them over here.

00:12:44.650 --> 00:12:45.510
Good morning,

00:12:45.510 --> 00:12:45.850
V.

00:12:45.850 --> 00:12:49.880
Now we're going to move them a little bit,

00:12:49.880 --> 00:12:53.540
Doan and,

00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:53.950
uh,

00:12:53.950 --> 00:13:03.400
we're also going to change the distances between them like this?

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:16.740
No,

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:18.240
we're going to use the same trick.

00:13:18.240 --> 00:13:19.250
0%.

00:13:19.250 --> 00:13:21.960
0%.

00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:25.450
0%.

00:13:25.450 --> 00:13:37.550
This one is going to be 0% to this one is going to be 0%.

00:13:37.550 --> 00:13:43.570
So we have all these?

00:13:43.570 --> 00:13:44.290
No,

00:13:44.290 --> 00:13:49.450
let's try to play it again and see what we can get.

00:13:49.450 --> 00:13:51.150
So here we have it.

00:13:51.150 --> 00:13:53.080
Then if we click over here,

00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:59.880
you can see it comes a top from bottom that's played again.

00:13:59.880 --> 00:14:03.650
Okay.

00:14:03.650 --> 00:14:10.220
It tells you that these are the possible actions.

00:14:10.220 --> 00:14:15.350
So this is how you do thes kind off animations using prototyping.

00:14:15.350 --> 00:14:19.130
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson if you have any questions,

00:14:19.130 --> 00:14:20.180
any suggestions?

00:14:20.180 --> 00:14:22.550
Make sure you always tell me.

00:14:22.550 --> 00:14:24.650
Let's move on to the next lesson.
