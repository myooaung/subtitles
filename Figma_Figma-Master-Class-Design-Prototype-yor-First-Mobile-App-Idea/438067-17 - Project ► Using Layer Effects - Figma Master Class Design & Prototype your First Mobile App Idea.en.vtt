00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.540
now,

00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:05.530
Your next assignment is that you are going to create these three buttons with the shadow

00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:09.450
fact with three D effect with insect or pressed effect.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:12.680
And I want you to mention your name at the top.

00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:14.840
So start creating this assignment.

00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.480
I'm going to give you some hands.

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:18.620
These are my settings.

00:00:18.620 --> 00:00:21.340
If you goto this shadow,

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.230
you can see these are my setting for shadow 0 15 Blood value is four.

00:00:27.230 --> 00:00:30.820
Spread is one dark blue color for the same.

00:00:30.820 --> 00:00:34.070
This blue 40% is the opacity off the shadow.

00:00:34.070 --> 00:00:35.770
Then we have this one.

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:38.980
This is actually inside this leader and so drop shadows.

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.450
You 05 is the vie value.

00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:43.790
So make it a bit a little bit down,

00:00:43.790 --> 00:00:48.770
and then we have the dark green color 100% for this one,

00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:51.190
we have to actually drop shadows.

00:00:51.190 --> 00:00:54.020
One is a 10 line white line at the bottom,

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:55.650
which I've already taught you.

00:00:55.650 --> 00:00:59.760
This one and in the shadow is 06 blur.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:08.030
Four is of I value and dark orange color for the shadow inside the breast effect and 100%

00:01:08.030 --> 00:01:09.710
it is its capacity.

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:11.880
So I am looking forward.

00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:14.550
So seeing this assignment,

00:01:14.550 --> 00:01:16.180
so start reading it now
