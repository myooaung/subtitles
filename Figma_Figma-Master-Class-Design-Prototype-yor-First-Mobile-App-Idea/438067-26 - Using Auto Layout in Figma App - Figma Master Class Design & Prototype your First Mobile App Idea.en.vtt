00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.740
in this video,

00:00:05.740 --> 00:00:08.640
we're going to learn about utterly or feature off Friedman,

00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:09.690
which is very latest,

00:00:09.690 --> 00:00:14.170
and you can create but ones that are going to expand on their own.

00:00:14.170 --> 00:00:15.550
So let's get started.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:18.850
First you have to do is you have to select the taxslayer.

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:21.790
So we're going toe Presti or slack this over here.

00:00:21.790 --> 00:00:26.650
And let's use something like this Down Lord,

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:27.950
No,

00:00:27.950 --> 00:00:31.750
let's escape And we have over text.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:32.510
Now,

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:36.400
what we're going to do is to add orderly out to the stacks were going toe,

00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:37.370
have a shortcut key,

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:42.840
which is called shift and a shift plus a and you can see we have order layout added.

00:00:42.840 --> 00:00:45.030
So there is a feedback.

00:00:45.030 --> 00:00:45.650
Go ahead.

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:46.520
Now,

00:00:46.520 --> 00:00:47.200
on the right,

00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.250
you can see we have horizontal layout orderly out,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:54.340
and these are the settings we are going to work with.

00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:56.450
So this is actually the padding.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:02.760
Horizontal is actually the direction in which it will have other elements or hair expand or

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:03.680
something like that.

00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:06.430
But right now we're not interested in this one.

00:01:06.430 --> 00:01:08.610
It is going to be auto hide,

00:01:08.610 --> 00:01:11.250
and these are the things we're going to be interested in.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:16.450
So first we're going to add a fill over here so you can see what is happening over here.

00:01:16.450 --> 00:01:18.940
So we are going to use a fell,

00:01:18.940 --> 00:01:20.180
for example,

00:01:20.180 --> 00:01:21.280
like this one.

00:01:21.280 --> 00:01:22.570
Okay,

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.200
so you can see this is our feel.

00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.780
And this is actually the padding on the right and on the left,

00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.060
off the stack so you can see this area over here.

00:01:30.060 --> 00:01:31.140
It is 10 pixels.

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:36.200
So if I try to increase it to 24 you can see we have more space on right and left.

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:37.670
Similarly,

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:38.830
for top and bottom.

00:01:38.830 --> 00:01:41.680
We're going to use something like 16.

00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:45.400
And this is actually the batting between two items.

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:46.780
So if we have toward three buttons,

00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.820
this is going to be the space between them right now.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.510
We're not interested in this value.

00:01:51.510 --> 00:01:54.450
We're going to come back in a few moments now.

00:01:54.450 --> 00:01:57.240
We're going to add some rounding rounded corners.

00:01:57.240 --> 00:02:02.720
I'm going to press it or hear or see was 16 excuse 50.

00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.810
So we have a bill,

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:04.550
but I know here.

00:02:04.550 --> 00:02:08.460
So what is special in this burden?

00:02:08.460 --> 00:02:09.890
So just double click,

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:15.020
and you can use sign up and it is going to expand.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.350
You can use create account,

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:20.490
and it is going to expand,

00:02:20.490 --> 00:02:23.710
and it is keeping all these values over here.

00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:26.090
So 24 you can change them.

00:02:26.090 --> 00:02:26.740
For example,

00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:30.050
I wanted to be 20 something like that,

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:32.350
and I wanted to be 15.

00:02:32.350 --> 00:02:33.440
Okay,

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.910
so you can have something like these values.

00:02:35.910 --> 00:02:40.090
So this is how you create an auto expandable but and using orderly out.

00:02:40.090 --> 00:02:40.810
Now,

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:42.330
this is not end of the story.

00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:43.830
We have something more.

00:02:43.830 --> 00:02:44.280
So,

00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:44.950
for example,

00:02:44.950 --> 00:02:47.130
I have a create account button and log in button,

00:02:47.130 --> 00:02:50.050
and they have specific spacing between them.

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:56.160
So what I can do is I'm going toe add another container frame,

00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.450
which is going to act as a container for this,

00:02:58.450 --> 00:03:00.510
this frame or despondent.

00:03:00.510 --> 00:03:07.950
So right now I'm going toe rename it toe button just to make it clear.

00:03:07.950 --> 00:03:09.760
So we're going to slack this,

00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:14.750
and we're going to add another orderly out toe use as a container.

00:03:14.750 --> 00:03:20.140
So shift A and auto sales added knows you can see we have a boundary off another container

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:20.140
.

00:03:20.140 --> 00:03:21.610
So this is actually ah,

00:03:21.610 --> 00:03:22.950
frame inside a frame,

00:03:22.950 --> 00:03:24.320
so button is actually a frame,

00:03:24.320 --> 00:03:26.010
and then we have another outer frame.

00:03:26.010 --> 00:03:26.610
Now,

00:03:26.610 --> 00:03:31.580
outer frame is actually going toe control the spacing between these items,

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:34.570
so you can see right now it shows vertical direction.

00:03:34.570 --> 00:03:37.280
So let me show you what it can do.

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.050
So now we have added another frame.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:42.000
And inside this we have.

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.800
But so select this burden and breast commander control the to duplicate.

00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:52.330
And you can see we have multiple buttons over here and they have a specific spacing between

00:03:52.330 --> 00:03:52.650
them.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.700
Not this pacing is controlled by this frame fund,

00:03:55.700 --> 00:03:56.750
which is their container.

00:03:56.750 --> 00:04:00.400
So we have 10 pixels right now.

00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:01.810
Let's increase it to 60.

00:04:01.810 --> 00:04:06.030
Now you can see and if we try to use horizontal,

00:04:06.030 --> 00:04:08.150
you can see they are going to be in destruction.

00:04:08.150 --> 00:04:11.890
So you have seen menu items on your websites.

00:04:11.890 --> 00:04:16.480
They are going to be something like this in a in destruction.

00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.790
And if I try toe have some less pissing like this.

00:04:20.790 --> 00:04:23.630
So let's delete the last button or hair,

00:04:23.630 --> 00:04:30.050
and I'm going to stick with these two and I'm going tohave log in option.

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:37.970
We're here so you can see this is how you create multiple buttons and using auto layout.

00:04:37.970 --> 00:04:44.280
And let's try to change the color off this button or here hopes this is the burden and I'm

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.990
going to change the color off it toe.

00:04:47.990 --> 00:04:54.950
Let's use something like the solar here.

00:04:54.950 --> 00:04:58.780
She was this.

00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:00.330
Okay,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:05.840
so if we have creatively out and logging and this is actually the use off utterly outs in

00:05:05.840 --> 00:05:06.420
figment.

00:05:06.420 --> 00:05:09.130
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:05:09.130 --> 00:05:15.220
How to create our I'd orderly out to your buttons and how to create these auto expandable

00:05:15.220 --> 00:05:17.090
buttons using Sigma.

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:18.570
If you have any questions,

00:05:18.570 --> 00:05:22.150
keep asking me Let's move on to the next lesson.
