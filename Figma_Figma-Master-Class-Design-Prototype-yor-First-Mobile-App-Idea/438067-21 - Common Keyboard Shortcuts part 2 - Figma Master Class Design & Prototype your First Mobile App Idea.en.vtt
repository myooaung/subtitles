00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.150
in this video,

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.930
we're going to look at some of the more Sigma keyboard shortcuts that are commonly used

00:00:11.930 --> 00:00:14.400
when you are on a frame or a canvas.

00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:18.100
So whenever you have opened up a new file,

00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.910
there are a lot of things you can do.

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:21.490
For example,

00:00:21.490 --> 00:00:23.200
you want to align these objects.

00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:23.830
So first,

00:00:23.830 --> 00:00:27.610
we're going to look at these alignment shortcut keys.

00:00:27.610 --> 00:00:30.730
So you you have to select two objects to align them.

00:00:30.730 --> 00:00:33.850
So once you have a lie selected to off them,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:38.200
you can press art and we for vertical centers.

00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:38.580
No,

00:00:38.580 --> 00:00:45.350
I'm going to press all and we So now you can see they have aligned in a vertical direction

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:45.350
.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:50.580
So the bottom one waas coming up and the left one was coming down,

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:59.050
I think I Let's go back Controller Kamanzi and Art and V.

00:00:59.050 --> 00:01:03.260
You can see so similarly we can do,

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:03.880
uh,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.990
with art and age for horizontal centers.

00:01:06.990 --> 00:01:11.200
So they're horizontal centers are you can see over here these are their centers.

00:01:11.200 --> 00:01:17.090
So I'm going to press all plus itch toe align them like that,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:17.600
for example.

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:25.360
I have this and this and I want to align them or gently I'm going to press art and each so

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:29.010
you can see this is how you align different objects.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:30.100
And most commonly,

00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.350
we use horizontal alignment and vertical alignment.

00:01:33.350 --> 00:01:38.300
Now we're going to look at some off the short cuts off the tools over here at the top,

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:40.980
which we're going to excess a lot of times.

00:01:40.980 --> 00:01:43.670
1st 1 is a R F for art board.

00:01:43.670 --> 00:01:45.450
You can draw your frame or art,

00:01:45.450 --> 00:01:46.230
but over here,

00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:51.750
or you can click over here and choose from a pre defined size or here,

00:01:51.750 --> 00:01:52.290
for example.

00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.050
I'm going to go with this android.

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:54.700
No,

00:01:54.700 --> 00:01:59.650
let's zoom in and I am going toe ban over here,

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:04.930
and I'm going to press my archy for a tangle or four ellipse,

00:02:04.930 --> 00:02:07.400
and I'm going to hold my shift key toe,

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:10.700
have it in proportion like this hell for line.

00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.290
So I'm going to drag my line.

00:02:12.290 --> 00:02:13.180
I'm holding shift,

00:02:13.180 --> 00:02:15.590
so it is straight similarly for tax tool.

00:02:15.590 --> 00:02:17.350
I'm going to press my tea,

00:02:17.350 --> 00:02:24.150
and I can either drag like this or I can just Presti and oops,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.920
I am have toe press escape and I have I am going to Presti again and press over here.

00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.060
Hello,

00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:33.690
Hopes Hello,

00:02:33.690 --> 00:02:34.130
dear.

00:02:34.130 --> 00:02:37.950
Something like this and I'm going to press escape at a time like that.

00:02:37.950 --> 00:02:42.270
So this is how you are going to use these tools over here?

00:02:42.270 --> 00:02:43.720
If you want to access spend tool,

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.770
you can press be shortcut key and do something like that,

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.470
something like this.

00:02:52.470 --> 00:02:53.590
And,

00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:54.350
um,

00:02:54.350 --> 00:02:57.440
I think that is all off the shortcut keys,

00:02:57.440 --> 00:02:59.810
I think which are commonly used.

00:02:59.810 --> 00:03:03.270
And these are the tools we're going to excess again and again.

00:03:03.270 --> 00:03:05.730
Now let's delete this one,

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:07.300
and I'm going to go back.

00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.810
We're here and we're going to study.

00:03:08.810 --> 00:03:14.440
Some of the more shortcuts were commonly going to use a lot of times one of them is

00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:15.290
duplicated,

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:17.650
So I wanted to pick it this layer,

00:03:17.650 --> 00:03:21.290
and I want it to be exact same like this.

00:03:21.290 --> 00:03:27.560
There are many ways first you can use art or option key and press,

00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:30.020
and you will have a double cursor like this.

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.820
Just drag this object wherever you want to place it,

00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.010
and you can see this is a duplicate.

00:03:36.010 --> 00:03:41.640
Now you can press and hold command or control plus d tohave.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.490
Another duplicate,

00:03:42.490 --> 00:03:43.340
it will be.

00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:45.110
It will repeat your step.

00:03:45.110 --> 00:03:48.330
The same spacing everything and duplicate the object.

00:03:48.330 --> 00:03:49.020
No,

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:51.140
we have three off these rectangles.

00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:52.640
I want to grope them.

00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:59.580
I'm going to select all of them and I'm going to press Commander Control G Group them now.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:01.320
You can see the icon over here.

00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:03.560
This group one has been changed.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:06.480
It has this marching answer here around it.

00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.250
So it's a group and all these rectangles are inside this group?

00:04:10.250 --> 00:04:11.320
No.

00:04:11.320 --> 00:04:12.240
If you want Owen,

00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:15.130
group it the same shortcut key.

00:04:15.130 --> 00:04:17.570
But with an addition off shift.

00:04:17.570 --> 00:04:20.360
So control or command,

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:22.350
plus shift plus g.

00:04:22.350 --> 00:04:24.380
So you can see now they're back.

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:26.600
We are out of outside of that group.

00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:28.660
That group is no more.

00:04:28.660 --> 00:04:29.960
Or there now,

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:30.610
on the left,

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.870
you can see this is our earlier stack.

00:04:32.870 --> 00:04:39.230
So we have image at the top rectangle this rectangle blue one at the bottom three black

00:04:39.230 --> 00:04:40.320
rectangles and text.

00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:40.420
No,

00:04:40.420 --> 00:04:44.010
If you want to change the position off the stacking without,

00:04:44.010 --> 00:04:45.120
you know,

00:04:45.120 --> 00:04:46.700
using your mouse,

00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:48.970
you can either drag them like this,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:51.500
are dragged them like this.

00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.840
For example,

00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.270
I have over here,

00:04:54.270 --> 00:04:56.470
so if I move my rectangle at the top,

00:04:56.470 --> 00:05:01.900
you can see that text is behind this Lear so if I move it up,

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.350
it is now over here.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:06.150
So this is called stacking order.

00:05:06.150 --> 00:05:15.760
I'm going to change the colors off these rectangles so you can easily see the difference.

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:18.230
And for this one,

00:05:18.230 --> 00:05:19.530
I'm going to use white.

00:05:19.530 --> 00:05:21.960
Now,

00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:25.150
you can see I have all these rectangles over here,

00:05:25.150 --> 00:05:28.850
and this is my rectangle at the bottom.

00:05:28.850 --> 00:05:29.060
No.

00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.210
If I want to change the stacking order,

00:05:31.210 --> 00:05:35.580
I can use shortcut key like control shift and brackets.

00:05:35.580 --> 00:05:36.020
So,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:36.440
no,

00:05:36.440 --> 00:05:37.570
I'm going to press.

00:05:37.570 --> 00:05:39.600
I have selected this layer,

00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:40.120
for example,

00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:40.790
this layer,

00:05:40.790 --> 00:05:50.880
and I am going to shift it up or down by using control shift on bracket so you can see over

00:05:50.880 --> 00:05:55.450
here you can either use this is going toe be at the bottom.

00:05:55.450 --> 00:06:00.540
So if I strike to use control shift and bracket left record,

00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.520
it is going to go down the most part,

00:06:03.520 --> 00:06:03.750
um,

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.680
off all the layers,

00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:06.280
stacks stack.

00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:06.750
So,

00:06:06.750 --> 00:06:07.310
similarly,

00:06:07.310 --> 00:06:11.190
if I press the right record or ending record,

00:06:11.190 --> 00:06:12.830
it is going to go up.

00:06:12.830 --> 00:06:20.330
You can see or hear the shortcut key for Mac keyboard is art plus command plus bracket.

00:06:20.330 --> 00:06:27.060
So it is our command bracket and for windows control shift and bracket left and right

00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:27.520
bracket.

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:37.380
So you can also remove your shift from the key and you just press and hold control along

00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:42.350
with your bracket and you can see it will move one step up,

00:06:42.350 --> 00:06:44.040
one step down,

00:06:44.040 --> 00:06:44.780
one step up.

00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:48.020
So I'm leaving shift inside this,

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:48.800
uh,

00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.690
shortcut key.

00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:56.180
So I will display both shortcuts in Mac version and Windows version for single layer

00:06:56.180 --> 00:07:02.890
movement if it didn't the stack and moving up and down at the bottom and at the top off the

00:07:02.890 --> 00:07:05.210
stack using your shortcut keys.

00:07:05.210 --> 00:07:11.990
Now let's end this lesson by showing you last toe shortcut keys,

00:07:11.990 --> 00:07:13.110
which are masking,

00:07:13.110 --> 00:07:17.810
and this component so you can see if you hover over there.

00:07:17.810 --> 00:07:21.010
It also shows you the shortcut key for Windows.

00:07:21.010 --> 00:07:24.160
It is control art plus K.

00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.920
And for Mac,

00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:28.710
it is control all for plus sort,

00:07:28.710 --> 00:07:31.630
command R plus key or option plus key.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.250
So same,

00:07:33.250 --> 00:07:34.560
everything is same.

00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.260
Just command is for Mech.

00:07:37.260 --> 00:07:42.160
So for creating a component which is going to be used again and again.

00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:43.490
So I'm going toe slack.

00:07:43.490 --> 00:07:51.750
All these three and I'm going toe either click over here or I can pass control art and key

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:51.750
.

00:07:51.750 --> 00:07:54.880
And now you can see the icon has been changed.

00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:56.640
And it is a component now,

00:07:56.640 --> 00:08:00.170
so you can see this is a very good shortcut key.

00:08:00.170 --> 00:08:02.560
We're going to use it again and again if you want.

00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:03.330
Toe,

00:08:03.330 --> 00:08:04.350
get back,

00:08:04.350 --> 00:08:08.320
toe your older states and you want to break this component.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:11.140
You don't want to use it rightly.

00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:13.990
Can we have a lot of options over here?

00:08:13.990 --> 00:08:15.370
Okay.

00:08:15.370 --> 00:08:16.730
So you can see or hear.

00:08:16.730 --> 00:08:17.640
Bring forward.

00:08:17.640 --> 00:08:18.450
Bring to back.

00:08:18.450 --> 00:08:19.470
These were the shortcut.

00:08:19.470 --> 00:08:22.520
Keys are used group selection or frame selection.

00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:23.900
You can also frame them.

00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:25.780
Flatten outline,

00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:27.160
use as mosque.

00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.870
This is the next shortcut key.

00:08:28.870 --> 00:08:31.650
I'm going to tell you control off plus m.

00:08:31.650 --> 00:08:34.470
So this is how you create a component?

00:08:34.470 --> 00:08:34.580
No.

00:08:34.580 --> 00:08:36.110
If you want to mask something,

00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:36.920
for example,

00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:39.350
I'm going to use an ellipse over here.

00:08:39.350 --> 00:08:41.770
And I want mosque,

00:08:41.770 --> 00:08:43.770
this area behind me.

00:08:43.770 --> 00:08:46.030
So this is a component at the back,

00:08:46.030 --> 00:08:49.450
and this is the ellipse at the top.

00:08:49.450 --> 00:08:52.530
So what I'm going to do is I'm going toe.

00:08:52.530 --> 00:08:54.550
Move this at the back.

00:08:54.550 --> 00:08:56.420
This one is at the back.

00:08:56.420 --> 00:09:03.240
You can see this is going to be my mosque and the top one is going to be what I'm actually

00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:04.010
trying to hide.

00:09:04.010 --> 00:09:07.350
So these portions on the left and right there going to be hidden.

00:09:07.350 --> 00:09:09.740
So I'm going to select both off them.

00:09:09.740 --> 00:09:17.180
You can see my container is at the back and my information or whatever I want to show.

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:20.440
My content is at the front container at the back,

00:09:20.440 --> 00:09:21.600
content at the front.

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:27.880
So we're going to slack both off them and we're going toe breast control or command R plus

00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:30.790
M control on em.

00:09:30.790 --> 00:09:33.140
So you can see now they are must.

00:09:33.140 --> 00:09:36.850
So this is You can see this sign shows you can see.

00:09:36.850 --> 00:09:37.000
What?

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:37.200
Here.

00:09:37.200 --> 00:09:38.290
This is small.

00:09:38.290 --> 00:09:39.660
Um,

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:42.350

This shows that this has been masked.

00:09:47.890 --> 00:09:49.930

We can also lock the layer over here,

00:09:56.050 --> 00:09:58.210
and this is our components.

00:09:58.210 --> 00:10:01.910
So this is the content we're trying to show.

00:10:01.910 --> 00:10:03.090

So once you are designing and started designing in fig MMA and you have forgotten any shark

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:11.820
.

00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:12.360
Erkki,

Just click over here in this narrow area,

00:10:16.850 --> 00:10:18.130
this question mark.

00:10:18.130 --> 00:10:20.730
And here we have shortcut keyboard shortcuts.

00:10:20.730 --> 00:10:23.050
So once you select this keyboard shortcuts,

00:10:23.050 --> 00:10:25.700

tax shapes election cause they transform,

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:36.410
arrange and components.

00:10:36.410 --> 00:10:38.960
So this ends our fig more shortcuts.

00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:45.190
your next lessons.

00:10:45.190 --> 00:10:50.200
And in your the new you can see design projects.

00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.720
So if you have any questions to ask me,

00:10:52.720 --> 00:10:54.370
