00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.840
in this video of,

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:10.810
we're going to learn a few off the prototyping basics in Sigma.

00:00:10.810 --> 00:00:15.630
Now you can see I have designed three simple screens and one is actually a left navigation

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:15.630
,

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:17.050
which is a custom frame.

00:00:17.050 --> 00:00:18.120
So if you click over here,

00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.940
you can see the size to 51.

00:00:19.940 --> 00:00:23.680
Height is 7 26 now.

00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:24.100
First,

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:26.500
we're going to start with these three screens.

00:00:26.500 --> 00:00:27.820
So here we have.

00:00:27.820 --> 00:00:32.060
Let's zone to fit Press one,

00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:33.500
and you can see you here.

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.670
We have three frames,

00:00:34.670 --> 00:00:36.870
so all of these have the same name,

00:00:36.870 --> 00:00:38.450
so I'm going to rename them.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:39.340
There's,

00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:40.080
uh,

00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:47.850
rename it one that's seen him in tow to that's rename it to three.

00:00:47.850 --> 00:00:50.410
So we have stepped one toe,

00:00:50.410 --> 00:00:51.620
33 screens,

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:54.310
and there's nothing much in this.

00:00:54.310 --> 00:00:59.630
The first thing you have to notice and you have to remember is that if you want to any made

00:00:59.630 --> 00:01:00.340
your objects,

00:01:00.340 --> 00:01:02.430
you have to name them the same Lear,

00:01:02.430 --> 00:01:03.000
for example.

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:04.240
Here it says,

00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:10.090
illustration or hear and see if we go in this Lius panel.

00:01:10.090 --> 00:01:15.050
The names are the same administration because they are the copies off each other,

00:01:15.050 --> 00:01:16.620
and in the same next one,

00:01:16.620 --> 00:01:19.120
it says illustration the same.

00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:22.350
Or here it must be Illustration.

00:01:22.350 --> 00:01:25.350
Okay,

00:01:25.350 --> 00:01:28.760
then also these layers were here.

00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:29.390
These groups,

00:01:29.390 --> 00:01:30.850
they have the same names.

00:01:30.850 --> 00:01:35.350
The only thing that is changing is one is This illustration is changing.

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:36.310
Name is the same.

00:01:36.310 --> 00:01:38.460
And also you can see over here.

00:01:38.460 --> 00:01:40.270
And we have these bottom bars.

00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:43.830
These are three bars and I'm actually changing their colors.

00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:44.970
So for this one,

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:46.010
the next one,

00:01:46.010 --> 00:01:49.530
we have this different color for the 3rd 1 This one is active,

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:50.660
other to ours,

00:01:50.660 --> 00:01:51.790
inactive.

00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:55.350
That is all that is happening inside the screen.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:01:57.850
Then we have this left navigation.

00:01:57.850 --> 00:01:58.980
So first,

00:01:58.980 --> 00:02:05.030
what we are going to do is we are going to move to our prototype or hear prototype screen,

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:07.080
and now you can see none off.

00:02:07.080 --> 00:02:08.530
The art boards are selected.

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:08.940
So first,

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:16.110
we have few prototypes settings like orientation than we have device which we want toe see

00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:18.530
in our prototype than we have the model Gould.

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:20.720
Midnight silver excuses.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.060
Also,

00:02:21.060 --> 00:02:22.570
we have some preview also.

00:02:22.570 --> 00:02:25.740
What background You want to view these selects.

00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:31.670
I'm going to select this background and then we have the starting frame.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:33.380
Which which one should we?

00:02:33.380 --> 00:02:35.150
So we're going to use one.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:40.810
And let's start combining these screens.

00:02:40.810 --> 00:02:43.310
Start connecting these screens Now.

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:47.940
First we're going to do is I have selected this art board and clicked on this name and we

00:02:47.940 --> 00:02:48.870
have a few.

00:02:48.870 --> 00:02:52.980
You can see a small circle over here that is basically a collector point.

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:53.960
Similarly,

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.520
if we click on over here,

00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.280
you can see if I were on different elements or groups.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:02.070
I am seeing seeing the same collector items.

00:03:02.070 --> 00:03:03.150
So if I want oh,

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:08.030
have some interaction applied toe This item I'm will do.

00:03:08.030 --> 00:03:09.890
Use this connector for this one.

00:03:09.890 --> 00:03:12.210
I moved us like this and use its corrector.

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.880
So right now,

00:03:13.880 --> 00:03:18.440
we don't more toe use specific any our hair.

00:03:18.440 --> 00:03:20.950
So we are going to go with the whole screen.

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:22.820
Let's select this one.

00:03:22.820 --> 00:03:29.650
So here we have just click and drag and we're going to leave to the next screen now as well

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:29.650
.

00:03:29.650 --> 00:03:31.330
As soon as we leave this,

00:03:31.330 --> 00:03:33.130
we have few options Over here.

00:03:33.130 --> 00:03:39.550
Interaction is going to be on tap on drag while hoovering while pressing came bad game Bad

00:03:39.550 --> 00:03:40.680
mouse center.

00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:41.380
Most leaves.

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:43.480
These are all different interactions.

00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.750
What actually you are trying to do So we're going to select on tap.

00:03:47.750 --> 00:03:53.850
Next is what's going to happen when you adapt this 80 0 ahead.

00:03:53.850 --> 00:04:00.680
Never get toe open Overlay swept with back close over the opening So these are different

00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:05.190
things you can do You can open up a link you can close any overly you are using.

00:04:05.190 --> 00:04:07.260
You can go back to the previous screen.

00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:10.620
You can slap with something else s.

00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:10.970
Oh,

00:04:10.970 --> 00:04:12.530
here we have open over live.

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:13.790
We're going to come back to this.

00:04:13.790 --> 00:04:14.550
Open your name.

00:04:14.550 --> 00:04:15.750
They're drawn.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.010
So,

00:04:17.010 --> 00:04:17.850
um,

00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:19.850
they expect this one again.

00:04:19.850 --> 00:04:22.580
So here is the interaction with going in.

00:04:22.580 --> 00:04:26.300
So next is what any mission we're going to do.

00:04:26.300 --> 00:04:27.580
So these are the animation.

00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:28.400
Citing moving.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:30.690
Move on with slide and slide out.

00:04:30.690 --> 00:04:37.640
Smart enemy dissolve or instant instant instant is going to do nothing is always going to

00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:38.960
dissolve into the next skin.

00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:39.710
Smart animated.

00:04:39.710 --> 00:04:41.450
We're going to use mostly this one.

00:04:41.450 --> 00:04:45.850
MoveOn is actually moving in and in which direction.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:47.430
So if it moves in,

00:04:47.430 --> 00:04:48.950
it is going to be like this.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:49.980
Okay,

00:04:49.980 --> 00:04:54.350
so you can see the animation preview over here.

00:04:54.350 --> 00:04:59.010
Next is we have Theis timing.

00:04:59.010 --> 00:04:59.850
So we have,

00:04:59.850 --> 00:05:00.510
for example,

00:05:00.510 --> 00:05:02.750
we're going to use 400 milliseconds.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:05.940
So let's use rather than move in.

00:05:05.940 --> 00:05:11.710
I'm going to use smart any minute and I'm going to use these in an hour.

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.890
This is the option I use most of the time.

00:05:13.890 --> 00:05:14.610
I love this.

00:05:14.610 --> 00:05:18.350
So this is options I have selected over here.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:21.180
And then again for this again,

00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:23.170
the 2nd 1 we're going to do the same.

00:05:23.170 --> 00:05:25.130
So I'm clicking this white area.

00:05:25.130 --> 00:05:26.300
I'm again.

00:05:26.300 --> 00:05:32.870
Slack click and drag and leave it to the nest next screen so you can see the settings I

00:05:32.870 --> 00:05:34.940
have did the last time on tap.

00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:39.430
Navigato smart and image easiness out the timing.

00:05:39.430 --> 00:05:40.550
They have been saved.

00:05:40.550 --> 00:05:43.440
So once you have selected the settings,

00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:45.750
it is going to apply toe next screens.

00:05:45.750 --> 00:05:47.000
If you want to change them,

00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.150
you can change them.

00:05:48.150 --> 00:05:51.800
So let's see how these actually look now.

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:56.610
So let's play this present and click on this present and we're going toe.

00:05:56.610 --> 00:05:58.050
See this prototype?

00:05:58.050 --> 00:06:06.260
Now you can see we are on the first screen and now we're going toe tap.

00:06:06.260 --> 00:06:06.890
Over here,

00:06:06.890 --> 00:06:11.880
you can see the smart enemy of any mission because we have set it to moving,

00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:14.320
easing ease out.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.270
And also the name of the illustrations are the same,

00:06:17.270 --> 00:06:22.150
so you can see how these illustrations illustrations are actually changing into each other

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:22.150
.

00:06:22.150 --> 00:06:24.660
Now you have seen this.

00:06:24.660 --> 00:06:26.320
We have nothing to go back to.

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:30.910
So we can also set your tab.

00:06:30.910 --> 00:06:32.110
Sections were here.

00:06:32.110 --> 00:06:35.330
We can also use that these and yes.

00:06:35.330 --> 00:06:38.360
So I'm going to leave it open and going to go back to my file.

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.620
And,

00:06:39.620 --> 00:06:40.250
um,

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:50.900
I can have set it to go back over here also for this one to go to the 1st 1 over here,

00:06:50.900 --> 00:07:01.950
I'm going to set it to go to the next one and this one to go back that school back or ahead

00:07:01.950 --> 00:07:03.490
and try to dabble ahead.

00:07:03.490 --> 00:07:08.850
And you can see how all of these are changing.

00:07:08.850 --> 00:07:13.020
Okay,

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:15.220
so we have learned that auto An emir.

00:07:15.220 --> 00:07:17.970
If you have the same names off the elements,

00:07:17.970 --> 00:07:18.950
they're going toe.

00:07:18.950 --> 00:07:20.580
I have Ah,

00:07:20.580 --> 00:07:21.970
riel time.

00:07:21.970 --> 00:07:22.710
Very nice.

00:07:22.710 --> 00:07:23.280
Smooth.

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:28.050
Any mission into transition from one shape to another are changing these.

00:07:28.050 --> 00:07:28.890
Okay?

00:07:28.890 --> 00:07:29.490
No,

00:07:29.490 --> 00:07:32.720
The second thing is step area.

00:07:32.720 --> 00:07:38.520
So whenever you are prototyping a lot of designers that make this mistake you can see this

00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:41.080
80 hour here it is very close to the next one.

00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:47.130
So first thing we can do is that we can increase its step India so you can do something

00:07:47.130 --> 00:07:49.650
like this and that's call it,

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:50.820
Yeah,

00:07:50.820 --> 00:07:52.550
India.

00:07:52.550 --> 00:07:58.550
And then we are going to go to design and reduce It's opacity to zero.

00:07:58.550 --> 00:08:02.100
So whenever you want toe correct something,

00:08:02.100 --> 00:08:03.910
you have to connect it using this.

00:08:03.910 --> 00:08:04.990
For example,

00:08:04.990 --> 00:08:07.050
let's delete this one.

00:08:07.050 --> 00:08:09.650
The staff media.

00:08:09.650 --> 00:08:10.830
Now you can see,

00:08:10.830 --> 00:08:11.340
for example,

00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:12.010
the skip,

00:08:12.010 --> 00:08:13.820
so Skip is going to be a button.

00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:15.560
So if I try to click over here,

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.680
you can see it has a very small bounding box.

00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:26.480
Now I'm going to do is I'm going toe create a rectangle over here and to have a happy idea

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:26.480
.

00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:33.960
We're going to call it that area and we're going to reduce it's opacity to 0% actually were

00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:34.910
trying to hide it.

00:08:34.910 --> 00:08:35.810
Why?

00:08:35.810 --> 00:08:42.250
Because this is going to just act as a tapped our top target area or the skipper them.

00:08:42.250 --> 00:08:46.700
So now if we go toe prototype now,

00:08:46.700 --> 00:08:48.700
you can see I'm going to move to this.

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:49.690
So here.

00:08:49.690 --> 00:08:50.070
Now,

00:08:50.070 --> 00:08:55.980
the next step is that we're going toe select this step any our hair and we're going toe

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.060
click and drag and leave it to this one.

00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.220
Now this says on tap Navigator,

00:09:01.220 --> 00:09:06.250
But we don't want to never get to this one and said we're going to open it as an overly so

00:09:06.250 --> 00:09:12.390
we're going to use this open over there and we have no different settings with the position

00:09:12.390 --> 00:09:16.250
off this overly center top left top center,

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:17.440
top ride,

00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.110
bottom left,

00:09:18.110 --> 00:09:19.100
bottom center,

00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:19.990
Something like that.

00:09:19.990 --> 00:09:21.220
But we're going to use men,

00:09:21.220 --> 00:09:27.850
will and I'm going to play set over here just like that.

00:09:27.850 --> 00:09:31.770
And a few more things is that I'm going to use it.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:33.050
This one top left.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.550
I can also use this position over here.

00:09:35.550 --> 00:09:39.840
I can also use manual or top left that can be used men will.

00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:41.810
I think I'm going to stick to manual right now.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:46.050
These are few pollution options to center or anything like that.

00:09:46.050 --> 00:09:47.470
Similarly,

00:09:47.470 --> 00:09:50.360
we have a few more options like clothes When clicking architects,

00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.150
whenever someone clicks outside of this area,

00:09:53.150 --> 00:09:56.000
it is going to get closed again.

00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.420
We have add background behind overly,

00:09:58.420 --> 00:10:01.330
so we're going to add some dark color your hair.

00:10:01.330 --> 00:10:07.750
You can also add vital and over here on do use 50% capacity and the any mission I'm going

00:10:07.750 --> 00:10:11.150
to use is moved in rather than instance.

00:10:11.150 --> 00:10:14.460
So it is going to move in like this from left,

00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.900
right and other settings are going to the same.

00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.770
400 milliseconds is in and out.

00:10:20.770 --> 00:10:22.390
Excuse this.

00:10:22.390 --> 00:10:25.140
Let's try this Now.

00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:28.820
This is the last step where we were were going toe klik.

00:10:28.820 --> 00:10:30.250
Our tab on the skip.

00:10:30.250 --> 00:10:31.540
Okay,

00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:35.190
so here we have our left navigation.

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:35.890
Very nice.

00:10:35.890 --> 00:10:38.340
When I say if I try to click over here outside,

00:10:38.340 --> 00:10:41.650
it's goingto go back in,

00:10:41.650 --> 00:10:42.250
out,

00:10:42.250 --> 00:10:43.160
in,

00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.850
out.

00:10:44.850 --> 00:10:47.730
So this looks really good.

00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:52.930
These are the two basics off any prototyping.

00:10:52.930 --> 00:10:55.630
You are going to link your screens together.

00:10:55.630 --> 00:11:00.120
You are going toe move from one scheme to another one by tapping.

00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.880
And also we're going toe overlay Different screens like you can see where here here we have

00:11:04.880 --> 00:11:07.410
over lead These are the directions moving.

00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:08.150
Move out.

00:11:08.150 --> 00:11:13.950
So that is all These are the basics off prototyping for sigma.

00:11:13.950 --> 00:11:15.410
If you have any questions,

00:11:15.410 --> 00:11:17.560
you can always ask me.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:19.870
Take care off all these tapping us.

00:11:19.870 --> 00:11:26.220
Try to have a good chap area so you can press them with the thump leather than your mouths

00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.340
off your PC or your Mac.

00:11:28.340 --> 00:11:31.060
So that is all.

00:11:31.060 --> 00:11:32.780
If you have any questions to ask me,

00:11:32.780 --> 00:11:35.330
let's meet you in another lesson.
