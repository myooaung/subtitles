00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.880
Now let's move to the resources for dinner.

00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:09.520
I have attacked with this exercise.

00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:09.930
You are.

00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:11.850
You have already downloaded it.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:14.770
Now we're going to open it and driver image over here.

00:00:14.770 --> 00:00:17.450
So here is our food app.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.060
Resource is,

00:00:19.060 --> 00:00:20.600
And inside the images folders,

00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:22.280
you can see these other images.

00:00:22.280 --> 00:00:27.690
Here are the images for at backgrounds that are very empty and can be used over here.

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:29.710
So I actually use this one.

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:32.950
So I'm going to drag and drop it and fig my like this,

00:00:32.950 --> 00:00:34.860
that zoom out.

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:38.930
And you can see this is actually the boundary off this image press shift,

00:00:38.930 --> 00:00:43.080
oppression person Hold shift and alter option key toe.

00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:45.580
Make it my big,

00:00:45.580 --> 00:00:46.790
smaller like this.

00:00:46.790 --> 00:00:50.650
You're going to move it like this.

00:00:50.650 --> 00:00:55.310
And one thing we're going to do is we're going to slack both off this layers and we are

00:00:55.310 --> 00:00:57.010
actually going to mosque control,

00:00:57.010 --> 00:00:59.090
art and marker command option.

00:00:59.090 --> 00:01:03.260
And so here is our mosque.

00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:08.720
So now you can see this background is actually masking masked by this rectangle over here,

00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:11.100
so I'm free to move it around.

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:13.990
Let's hide our layout.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:17.390
Grid control shift four is a shortcut on,

00:01:17.390 --> 00:01:18.690
um,

00:01:18.690 --> 00:01:23.510
B c and I think control G or controlled.

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:26.400
I don't remember the shortcut on the Mac,

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:28.050
but it will be displayed on the screen.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:29.530
So,

00:01:29.530 --> 00:01:30.250
um,

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:36.550
just to make sure that we can easily design rather than discs it distracted by over here.

00:01:36.550 --> 00:01:38.960
So I want to move this.

00:01:38.960 --> 00:01:41.230
You can see I have selected this image or here.

00:01:41.230 --> 00:01:43.270
So it is moving inside this container.

00:01:43.270 --> 00:01:48.600
So let's move it around like this,

00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.540
and you can enlarge it and you can make it up.

00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:56.110
It's a bit smaller like this,

00:01:56.110 --> 00:01:59.330
and I think this is looking great.

00:01:59.330 --> 00:01:59.990
Now,

00:01:59.990 --> 00:02:01.750
if you want to change Ah,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:05.960
this image or any settings you can go to this image.

00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:09.920
You can change the highlights increase the highlight,

00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:14.340
Like this highlight is actually making it a bit more brighter.

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:17.210
Whites are more prominent shadows,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:17.580
Atmore,

00:02:17.580 --> 00:02:18.170
dark against.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:20.350
If you want to make the shadows more dark,

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:24.350
you can go over here or maybe something like this.

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:28.050
So here we have our image.

00:02:28.050 --> 00:02:33.410
Now we're going to go to other sources folder and get our logo Now.

00:02:33.410 --> 00:02:33.840
Actually,

00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:40.340
what I did is I created this logo inside the stigma hap and I don't really recommend I

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:42.540
really never recommend fig motto.

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:43.430
Create a logo.

00:02:43.430 --> 00:02:48.150
So what is happening is when I try to export it using SVG form it.

00:02:48.150 --> 00:02:51.150
It is giving me a very veered kind off logo.

00:02:51.150 --> 00:02:57.360
So now you can see I have exported it using PNG farmers over here and exported this logo.

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.260
And we're going to drag this PNG logo because s which is not working.

00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:04.490
I'm I'm not sure what is happening,

00:03:04.490 --> 00:03:07.460
So here we have our file.

00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:13.170
So let's drag this over here like this.

00:03:13.170 --> 00:03:17.750
So we are going toe place our logo like this over here,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:21.820
and then we're going to place our text over here,

00:03:21.820 --> 00:03:24.850
which waas Healthy recipe book.

00:03:24.850 --> 00:03:28.560
Now we're going to grab our text tool and trustee,

00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.150
and we're going to right over here.

00:03:30.150 --> 00:03:35.340
Healthy recipes book,

00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.650
and you can use Roberta for two.

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:42.380
But we have used Yeah,

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:44.630
Monta form.

00:03:44.630 --> 00:03:46.990
This is actually a Google phone gets free,

00:03:46.990 --> 00:03:50.750
and we're going to use 18 exist over here for this one.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:52.170
And,

00:03:52.170 --> 00:03:53.150
uh,

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:55.500
letter spacing is going to be 5%.

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:56.780
And,

00:03:56.780 --> 00:03:57.560
uh,

00:03:57.560 --> 00:04:03.350
I think that it's all we're going to align it in the middle off this a little bit on the

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:14.650
left and the color will be will be next use except a similar seven year.

00:04:14.650 --> 00:04:17.450
It won 88.

00:04:17.450 --> 00:04:21.800
So this is actually a great blue color.

00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:27.950
You can see your hair and I I don't want the user to be very attentive to this.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:28.470
So here.

00:04:28.470 --> 00:04:29.820
So this is our logo.

00:04:29.820 --> 00:04:33.250
And this is our next line or whatever you call it.

00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:34.340
Okay,

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:35.650
so here we have it.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.390
Then we're going to create two buttons which are going to be log in with Facebook and log

00:04:40.390 --> 00:04:41.200
in with Google.

00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:45.600
So get and use those Google and Facebook colors.

00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:48.730
You can go to this website brand color start net,

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:50.930
and you can find the colors off Google,

00:04:50.930 --> 00:04:51.590
for example.

00:04:51.590 --> 00:04:53.140
You can type Google over here,

00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:58.120
and this is the red color Google is using so you can copy it took clipboard,

00:04:58.120 --> 00:05:00.050
and you can use the same color or here.

00:05:00.050 --> 00:05:02.150
So we're going to create a rectangle,

00:05:02.150 --> 00:05:05.950
and we are going to use blue colors for Google,

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:09.420
a regular for Google and Blucher for Facebook,

00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:09.970
this one.

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:14.770
So just grabbing these values over here and we're going to create some buttons,

00:05:14.770 --> 00:05:22.450
grab a rectangle and the burden size I'm going to use is 304 is the third time.

00:05:22.450 --> 00:05:23.100
48.

00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:24.070
Brazil is the height,

00:05:24.070 --> 00:05:30.180
so let's use 304 and 48 is the height.

00:05:30.180 --> 00:05:32.570
Next align it in the middle,

00:05:32.570 --> 00:05:36.350
or you can use this one are our options itch.

00:05:36.350 --> 00:05:39.450
So this is actually the shortcut key.

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:42.100
And I'm going to use the Facebook color,

00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:49.590
which is going to be let's copied from here and just based it were here like this.

00:05:49.590 --> 00:05:51.170
Enter.

00:05:51.170 --> 00:05:53.120
So we have our Facebook button.

00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:53.860
Next,

00:05:53.860 --> 00:05:57.860
use a rounded corners off four exit around ness over here.

00:05:57.860 --> 00:05:59.680
So this is going to be our button,

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:03.800
and we're going to drag and drop our Facebook icon,

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:07.540
which we have already inside of a resource is icons.

00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:12.510
And this is going to be Facebook with the Facebook Facebook,

00:06:12.510 --> 00:06:13.250
This one.

00:06:13.250 --> 00:06:15.980
So here's the Facebook.

00:06:15.980 --> 00:06:20.620
We're going to drag and drop it over here like this that's moving inside.

00:06:20.620 --> 00:06:24.770
This that's ungroomed this Come on,

00:06:24.770 --> 00:06:25.450
shift cheap.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:28.060
So we actually need this.

00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:29.290
We don't need this one.

00:06:29.290 --> 00:06:34.650
And also march if g one group.

00:06:34.650 --> 00:06:38.250
So this is our Facebook.

00:06:38.250 --> 00:06:39.650
Oh,

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:39.940
cool.

00:06:39.940 --> 00:06:44.350
So we're going toe color it white,

00:06:44.350 --> 00:06:52.360
or we can use a big off um bluish white over here.

00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:57.570
Something like this.

00:06:57.570 --> 00:07:00.850
This can work too.

00:07:00.850 --> 00:07:07.650
So the tax we're going to use is log in Facebook.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:17.390
They reflect this our option V work quickly.

00:07:17.390 --> 00:07:18.050
Align it.

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:23.080
Or you can use this one Option B and again,

00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:23.600
the color.

00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:25.450
We're going to use this this same color.

00:07:25.450 --> 00:07:29.290
So we're going toe add it into our Oops.

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:34.360
What was happening added into other styles.

00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:37.790
I'm going toe plus blue,

00:07:37.790 --> 00:07:38.490
um,

00:07:38.490 --> 00:07:39.650
white,

00:07:39.650 --> 00:07:41.590
uh,

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:41.950
blue.

00:07:41.950 --> 00:07:45.380
Excuse this.

00:07:45.380 --> 00:07:48.310
And at this color,

00:07:48.310 --> 00:07:48.650
too.

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.650
We're going to name it Facebook.

00:07:52.650 --> 00:07:55.370
Yes,

00:07:55.370 --> 00:07:56.050
smoke.

00:07:56.050 --> 00:08:02.930
So to get this to the same white,

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.610
we're going to use styles over here,

00:08:05.610 --> 00:08:06.750
just like this color.

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:11.770
So log in with Facebook and the text will be Rubik.

00:08:11.770 --> 00:08:14.260
So four buttons I'm using real big phone.

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:17.520
Arabic is also Google for well,

00:08:17.520 --> 00:08:18.440
good die fists.

00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:20.130
And as you can see,

00:08:20.130 --> 00:08:21.650
it is a bit bigger typeface.

00:08:21.650 --> 00:08:26.190
So we're going to use a bit smaller like this,

00:08:26.190 --> 00:08:30.990
and we're going to use 2% or hair and we're going to use the case,

00:08:30.990 --> 00:08:31.590
Toby,

00:08:31.590 --> 00:08:33.700
all gaps like this.

00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:38.390
Now again,

00:08:38.390 --> 00:08:42.450
we're going to align it in the middle because it is getting out.

00:08:42.450 --> 00:08:43.350
No,

00:08:43.350 --> 00:08:45.970
we can align these sides off the burden.

00:08:45.970 --> 00:08:48.790
So let's have a gap off.

00:08:48.790 --> 00:08:54.750
20 four over here on the left.

00:08:54.750 --> 00:08:57.540
Let's have a 24 were here,

00:08:57.540 --> 00:08:57.850
toe.

00:08:57.850 --> 00:08:59.640
So that's your started.

00:08:59.640 --> 00:09:00.250
A war here.

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:02.610
So we have over Britain.

00:09:02.610 --> 00:09:03.700
You can see you here.

00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:06.440
Let's select this.

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.590
All of these.

00:09:07.590 --> 00:09:14.400
Let's first group this controlling command G.

00:09:14.400 --> 00:09:16.250
So we have you can see.

00:09:16.250 --> 00:09:16.530
No,

00:09:16.530 --> 00:09:20.050
this is a bit better because we have our background separated.

00:09:20.050 --> 00:09:22.780
Now you can see the masking any eyes over here.

00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:25.730
So we have all these outside of the mosque ing.

00:09:25.730 --> 00:09:28.210
So this is our logo.

00:09:28.210 --> 00:09:32.350
So let's group these our scald them logo group.

00:09:32.350 --> 00:09:39.140
This is our background for button BG Burton median.

00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:49.970
And these all these are linked with the button Facebook vidi in Facebook like this,

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:51.730
it is always better.

00:09:51.730 --> 00:09:53.690
You arrange everything like this.

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:55.150
So once we have this,

00:09:55.150 --> 00:09:56.660
we're going to press control.

00:09:56.660 --> 00:10:04.500
Command d are we can create a component or here so you can do anything like this.

00:10:04.500 --> 00:10:08.260
So right now I'm not going toe create a component.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:14.790
I'm going toe just duplicate it and replicated and just have another burden over here like

00:10:14.790 --> 00:10:15.350
this.

00:10:15.350 --> 00:10:16.250
And,

00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:17.150
um,

00:10:17.150 --> 00:10:21.850
let's drag the Google icon over here.

00:10:21.850 --> 00:10:25.330
Yeah,

00:10:25.330 --> 00:10:26.250
we have it.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:29.350
Let's dragged over here.

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:33.150
Same white color,

00:10:33.150 --> 00:10:34.400
local colors.

00:10:34.400 --> 00:10:36.770
And this is the white cliff we're going to use.

00:10:36.770 --> 00:10:38.110
Oops.

00:10:38.110 --> 00:10:40.950
So?

00:10:40.950 --> 00:10:44.210
So let's move it with the keyboard.

00:10:44.210 --> 00:10:47.910
I'm pressing shift and arrow keys to move it around,

00:10:47.910 --> 00:10:49.840
because from my mouse,

00:10:49.840 --> 00:10:50.900
it wasn't hard,

00:10:50.900 --> 00:10:52.050
easily crab able.

00:10:52.050 --> 00:10:56.150
So let's remove this group.

00:10:56.150 --> 00:11:00.720
This is actually okay,

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:01.960
so that's that's good.

00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:02.450
Okay,

00:11:02.450 --> 00:11:05.920
so let's sing the color toe.

00:11:05.920 --> 00:11:10.510
Same white over here and the Bagram Gallery be Google killer.

00:11:10.510 --> 00:11:15.150
So we're going to go over here and find the Google red color.

00:11:15.150 --> 00:11:21.010
This is going to be the Google killer and less that's did,

00:11:21.010 --> 00:11:24.650
added and jean the color from the schoolgirl Killer.

00:11:24.650 --> 00:11:29.400
And now we're going to add this Google color to our style store.

00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:35.050
So let's add Google correct created style.

00:11:35.050 --> 00:11:38.050
So we have our two buttons.

00:11:38.050 --> 00:11:39.810
One more thing is,

00:11:39.810 --> 00:11:41.640
if you want to add shadows,

00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:43.440
you can add a fact store,

00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:49.240
so I'm going to add very subtle drop shadow over here to blur.

00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:52.890
Let's use the blood off it,

00:11:52.890 --> 00:11:58.270
and I'm going to have it too exults like this,

00:11:58.270 --> 00:12:00.970
and this is going to be almost 15% Very,

00:12:00.970 --> 00:12:02.150
very subtle shadow.

00:12:02.150 --> 00:12:04.680
So once we have this shadow,

00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:08.770
we can also cleared an effect called a fact style.

00:12:08.770 --> 00:12:11.570
And we're going to call it Burton Shadow.

00:12:11.570 --> 00:12:14.250
So certain.

00:12:14.250 --> 00:12:19.460
So now we're going to select its background over here,

00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:24.490
and we are going to apply the same effect that is all.

00:12:24.490 --> 00:12:26.100
So,

00:12:26.100 --> 00:12:26.650
uh,

00:12:26.650 --> 00:12:29.040
so I think you are enjoying this.

00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:29.460
And,

00:12:29.460 --> 00:12:30.240
um,

00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:36.270
you will be really amazed by the features off Sigma let's and the last line over here,

00:12:36.270 --> 00:12:37.630
which is Let's browse.

00:12:37.630 --> 00:12:37.970
No.

00:12:37.970 --> 00:12:51.150
Or you can also rename it to skip log in something like that aren't itch.

00:12:51.150 --> 00:12:56.650
Let's move it with shift and arrow keys and you can also move it.

00:12:56.650 --> 00:13:03.550
One pigs by arrow keys like this single pixel and I am going toe Make it.

00:13:03.550 --> 00:13:05.840
Let's press your present.

00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:07.230
Hold your AR drop shin key,

00:13:07.230 --> 00:13:09.500
and you can see you have selected this one.

00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.190
And if you drag and um,

00:13:12.190 --> 00:13:14.680
over on your and other item,

00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:19.850
it will show you the distance between both of these 2 27 I wanted Toby.

00:13:19.850 --> 00:13:21.230
Let's,

00:13:21.230 --> 00:13:22.050
um,

00:13:22.050 --> 00:13:24.150
used 20.

00:13:24.150 --> 00:13:30.880
I think that it's that it's good that is easily definable,

00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:34.740
so you can also have toe think about things.

00:13:34.740 --> 00:13:35.310
For example,

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.850
this is going to be the tab idea for this one.

00:13:37.850 --> 00:13:40.950
And this is going to the DAP in here for this one.

00:13:40.950 --> 00:13:43.900
This is going to be the tab idea or section for this one.

00:13:43.900 --> 00:13:48.560
So these have some good margins between them.

00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:50.790
Good distance between them.

00:13:50.790 --> 00:13:53.150
So user can easily rapid.

00:13:53.150 --> 00:13:59.150
So the color for this one skip log and will be H S B.

00:13:59.150 --> 00:14:03.110
The color is 1 78 which is the green.

00:14:03.110 --> 00:14:03.670
You,

00:14:03.670 --> 00:14:10.350
our major primary color 73 is the saturation and brightness is 19%.

00:14:10.350 --> 00:14:12.530
This is the color for skip log.

00:14:12.530 --> 00:14:15.500
And this is actually our major.

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:17.710
You can see color,

00:14:17.710 --> 00:14:18.960
which is our legs.

00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:21.450
Let's college dark green.

00:14:21.450 --> 00:14:23.270
This is our dark,

00:14:23.270 --> 00:14:31.190
very blackish green color were using it for text which are very dark and mostly for thes

00:14:31.190 --> 00:14:32.440
links links color.

00:14:32.440 --> 00:14:33.540
So this is going to be linked.

00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:35.510
This is also the same color for this logo.

00:14:35.510 --> 00:14:36.990
The slogans not black.

00:14:36.990 --> 00:14:38.130
It is very dark green,

00:14:38.130 --> 00:14:38.780
which is this one?

00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:44.850
Skip skip long and so the distance between these two buttons is 12 12 pixels.

00:14:44.850 --> 00:14:47.680
You can add the distance if you want to.

00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.420
If you wanted to be more spacious.

00:14:49.420 --> 00:14:52.950
You can add it to be like 16 like this.

00:14:52.950 --> 00:14:58.450
And you can also add some more distance over here 24 or something like this.

00:14:58.450 --> 00:15:05.270
But I think I like it like this 12 is good enough for me.

00:15:05.270 --> 00:15:07.100
And 20 is good enough for me to.

00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:14.000
So this is how you create and keep on the Jews.

00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:23.370
Ability issues off the absolved because this these three But as they are lower in this area

00:15:23.370 --> 00:15:28.470
our hair your Tom pure you system can easily reach out this area.

00:15:28.470 --> 00:15:29.590
Now,

00:15:29.590 --> 00:15:30.480
if you want to,

00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:32.030
you have completed the screen.

00:15:32.030 --> 00:15:33.180
So let's zoom out.

00:15:33.180 --> 00:15:34.400
This is very necessary.

00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:36.520
Whenever you create something,

00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:39.180
I always zoom out and see that if I want.

00:15:39.180 --> 00:15:44.670
We're just a spacing Are some elements I want to move around.

00:15:44.670 --> 00:15:50.900
You can see these were not in the centres where I moved them in the center a little bit up

00:15:50.900 --> 00:15:51.570
over here.

00:15:51.570 --> 00:15:52.600
It is looking great.

00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:56.360
Let's view this in a prototype over here.

00:15:56.360 --> 00:16:01.420
So I moved to this prototype iPhone 11 prove model.

00:16:01.420 --> 00:16:05.560
I'm going to use space screen and,

00:16:05.560 --> 00:16:06.150
uh,

00:16:06.150 --> 00:16:13.560
explained this is the one thing I don't like about fig might take some time because it is a

00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:14.380
cloud app.

00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:19.620
It takes some time if your images are very big and it takes some time to Lord them like

00:16:19.620 --> 00:16:20.000
this.

00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:23.000
So this is looking good.

00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:26.740
I think I have the problem off this to Chile's over here.

00:16:26.740 --> 00:16:28.580
You can adjust the image.

00:16:28.580 --> 00:16:28.820
What?

00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:29.350
However,

00:16:29.350 --> 00:16:29.960
you warned.

00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:38.250
So we're going to quickly just the image and let's make it a bit bigger like this.

00:16:38.250 --> 00:16:42.330
Okay,

00:16:42.330 --> 00:16:44.000
so this is looking perfect for me.

00:16:44.000 --> 00:16:50.060
This looks perfect one to zoom to the fit.

00:16:50.060 --> 00:16:53.400
And I think this is going to end up this lesson.

00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:57.260
If we have any problem or anything that is not looking great.

00:16:57.260 --> 00:16:58.070
For example,

00:16:58.070 --> 00:17:00.320
you can see in the image over here background.

00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:01.680
There is something over here.

00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:05.150
So the simple trick is if you want to remove something,

00:17:05.150 --> 00:17:07.780
I'm going to use an ellipse over here like this.

00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:10.160
I moved to design,

00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.510
and I'm going toe use the same color color picker,

00:17:14.510 --> 00:17:21.640
and I'm going to use the same color as this area over here so you can see her here.

00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:26.460
Now I am going to move this batch over here like this,

00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:31.550
and let's move it just above this background,

00:17:31.550 --> 00:17:36.910
and instead I think I can see some of the shadow over here.

00:17:36.910 --> 00:17:38.050
Let's zoom in.

00:17:38.050 --> 00:17:39.050
Oops,

00:17:39.050 --> 00:17:42.320
looks like this.

00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:44.780
And let's make it a bigger like this.

00:17:44.780 --> 00:17:54.050
So now you can see it is not very visible from far away.

00:17:54.050 --> 00:17:56.790
You cannot guess that there is something used over here,

00:17:56.790 --> 00:18:00.800
So it is just most inside your backgrounds.

00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:01.720
This is looking good.

00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:06.670
So these are simple tricks you can learn when someone is designing.

00:18:06.670 --> 00:18:08.510
I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:18:08.510 --> 00:18:11.560
If you have any questions or you didn't strain anything,

00:18:11.560 --> 00:18:12.510
you can ask me.

00:18:12.510 --> 00:18:14.670
Let's move on to the next lesson.
