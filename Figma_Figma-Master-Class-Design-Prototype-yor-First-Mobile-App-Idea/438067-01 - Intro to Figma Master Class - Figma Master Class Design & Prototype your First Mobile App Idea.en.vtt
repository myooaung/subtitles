00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:26.400
Similarly,

00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:31.400
we're going to share with you all the different prototyping tools and tips and techniques

00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:37.280
on how to use different transition affects different an emissions so you can convert your

00:00:37.280 --> 00:00:41.050
static designs and boring designs into something awesome.

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:46.150

I believe that anyone can learn any design tool within just two weeks,

00:01:20.890 --> 00:01:21.870
that is enough.

00:01:21.870 --> 00:01:25.400
So let's get started and dive into figment now.
