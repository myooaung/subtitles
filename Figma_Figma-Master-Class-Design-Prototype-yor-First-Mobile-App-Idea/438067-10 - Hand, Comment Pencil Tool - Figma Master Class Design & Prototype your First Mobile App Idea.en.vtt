00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.900
This is the last part off your figment tools,

00:00:07.900 --> 00:00:10.980
and I'm going to share with you some of the tools we left over here.

00:00:10.980 --> 00:00:11.580
For example,

00:00:11.580 --> 00:00:13.010
this pencil tool.

00:00:13.010 --> 00:00:16.540
Then we have this hand tool and disk a mental,

00:00:16.540 --> 00:00:18.960
although these are not very helpful.

00:00:18.960 --> 00:00:20.710
But if you click on this pencil tool,

00:00:20.710 --> 00:00:24.500
you can see you can draw whatever you like.

00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:27.840
So if you have a tablet or Ben tabler device,

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:29.720
you can easily sign,

00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:33.000
or here you can easily pinpoint design areas like this.

00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:33.650
Over here,

00:00:33.650 --> 00:00:36.270
you can use whatever you want.

00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:39.010
You can draw freely on this screen.

00:00:39.010 --> 00:00:41.440
These are almost my signatures were here,

00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:44.360
and this is all about pencil tool,

00:00:44.360 --> 00:00:46.770
so you don't need to worry about it.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:48.200
So if you want to change,

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:49.890
you can double click,

00:00:49.890 --> 00:00:54.660
and you will have different options like over here like this,

00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:03.110
and you can also increase its skip so you can see these are almost my signatures.

00:01:03.110 --> 00:01:03.910
Not very perfect.

00:01:03.910 --> 00:01:05.890
But if I had a pen tablet,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.030
which I'm going to buy in near future Aiken,

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:13.230
use something like this so I can draw factors.

00:01:13.230 --> 00:01:14.190
Whatever I want,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:16.560
I can draw some.

00:01:16.560 --> 00:01:19.150
You can see cartoons or something like that.

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:26.330
So this is all about this pencil to then we have this handle which is going to move

00:01:26.330 --> 00:01:27.150
anything,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:28.550
anywhere you want.

00:01:28.550 --> 00:01:31.190
So let's move back to move Tool,

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:37.510
which is V And if you want to quickly go to this hand to you can press or hold your space

00:01:37.510 --> 00:01:41.050
bar like this and now you can move around.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:44.840
So this is the short cut key for this hand tool press space bar,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:48.380
and you can move on your canvas.

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:49.600
Similarly,

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.190
we have this comment tool and you can add your command show here.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:55.610
This is for basically for example,

00:01:55.610 --> 00:02:00.700
I love you're sick natures.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:11.150
I'm going to add a smiley or here Smoochy and most so you can see in this comment section

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:15.390
I'm seeing that one command from me and home address.

00:02:15.390 --> 00:02:17.460
And you can see this is my name in few seconds.

00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:18.190
I love you signatures.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.580
So if you have a whole team,

00:02:19.580 --> 00:02:24.030
they can reply back and they can say that really,

00:02:24.030 --> 00:02:25.020
or something like that.

00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:27.750
Whatever you they want toe command over here.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:29.850
So this is you can say,

00:02:29.850 --> 00:02:37.640
a bit off collaboration tool for collaborating on your design and improving it So these are

00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.330
the rest of the tools over here.

00:02:39.330 --> 00:02:42.540
A few more things which I think I forgot,

00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:45.860
is that if you go over here on rectangle,

00:02:45.860 --> 00:02:46.320
for example,

00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:55.600
I have drawn one rectangle And if I can draw ellipse over here and if I overlap these,

00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.630
I can slack both off them both off them.

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:01.210
I'm selecting them by clicking shift,

00:03:01.210 --> 00:03:02.100
shift,

00:03:02.100 --> 00:03:04.400
holding down shift and clicking on both of them.

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:05.850
So let's dilute this one.

00:03:05.850 --> 00:03:06.710
Also,

00:03:06.710 --> 00:03:09.150
this one also this one.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:11.880
So here we have two different shapes.

00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.380
And if I want to combine them,

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:15.630
you can see we have different options over here.

00:03:15.630 --> 00:03:16.650
Union selection.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:23.190
So now they are combined and they are one shape over here like this.

00:03:23.190 --> 00:03:23.740
Still,

00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:24.780
you can address them.

00:03:24.780 --> 00:03:25.960
You can click over here,

00:03:25.960 --> 00:03:26.540
double click,

00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:28.880
and you will have to shapes in the union.

00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:30.540
You can move them around,

00:03:30.540 --> 00:03:31.100
for example.

00:03:31.100 --> 00:03:32.850
I want to have it here.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:34.330
And I,

00:03:34.330 --> 00:03:34.950
for example,

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:36.340
I wanted duplicate it.

00:03:36.340 --> 00:03:38.350
I want to have another shape like this.

00:03:38.350 --> 00:03:42.250
I actually pressed and hold my archer option key to duplicate these.

00:03:42.250 --> 00:03:43.820
So click on this.

00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:47.050
It's like this press and hold Arden option.

00:03:47.050 --> 00:03:50.160
You will have the Bellerose and you can have something like this.

00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.950
So you can see this is a union off this ship.

00:03:52.950 --> 00:03:54.890
Similarly,

00:03:54.890 --> 00:03:56.650
we can have subject selection.

00:03:56.650 --> 00:04:03.930
So now you can see all the top ellipses they subtracted from this rectangle over here.

00:04:03.930 --> 00:04:08.070
Then we have this excludes selections or whatever is,

00:04:08.070 --> 00:04:08.960
um,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:10.220
overlapped.

00:04:10.220 --> 00:04:11.590
It is going to be excluded.

00:04:11.590 --> 00:04:12.420
So,

00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:12.960
for example,

00:04:12.960 --> 00:04:13.910
the overlapping areas,

00:04:13.910 --> 00:04:15.060
they're going to be removed.

00:04:15.060 --> 00:04:16.250
You can see where Here.

00:04:16.250 --> 00:04:20.060
So you can see now these overlapping areas have been removed.

00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:22.360
To understand this intersect selection,

00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:24.950
we're going to have new shapes.

00:04:24.950 --> 00:04:26.390
So let's delete this one.

00:04:26.390 --> 00:04:33.550
We have one rectangle over here.

00:04:33.550 --> 00:04:35.450
2nd 1 more here,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:37.150
which is going to be a bit darker.

00:04:37.150 --> 00:04:40.350
That's like boat off them.

00:04:40.350 --> 00:04:42.050
Inspect intersect.

00:04:42.050 --> 00:04:47.490
So Intersect is actually whatever is common inside them and everything is removed.

00:04:47.490 --> 00:04:52.650
So the common area is going to be at the end and everything is going to be removed.

00:04:52.650 --> 00:04:54.730
So this is how this,

00:04:54.730 --> 00:04:55.290
uh,

00:04:55.290 --> 00:04:59.600
this combination or this union tool actually works.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.500
If you have any questions or didn't understand anything,

00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:03.840
you can always ask me.

00:05:03.840 --> 00:05:06.380
Let's move on to the next lesson.
