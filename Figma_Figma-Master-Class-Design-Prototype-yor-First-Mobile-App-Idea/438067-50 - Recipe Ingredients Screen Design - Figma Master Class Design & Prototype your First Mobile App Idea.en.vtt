00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:18.000
in the next few videos,

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.210
we're going to create this single recipe ingredients and single recipe profession,

00:00:22.210 --> 00:00:24.650
these two screens and this overlay.

00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:31.060
And these two I'm going to skip profile and settings and this one this one is almost

00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:33.550
similar to this such deserts over here.

00:00:33.550 --> 00:00:39.150
So I'm going to skip this and I'm going to leave it to you guys and you are going to make

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:39.540
this.

00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:41.060
You already have seen this.

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:48.540
I'm going toe Include all these all this app links so you can view them and you can create

00:00:48.540 --> 00:00:50.750
your own as your assignment.

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:52.410
This'll overlay.

00:00:52.410 --> 00:00:57.860
And these two single recipes I'm going to finish because these are all these screens they

00:00:57.860 --> 00:01:06.590
are going toe finish up all the techniques I'm going to show you inside Sigma Onda Thies.

00:01:06.590 --> 00:01:10.890
This will be a repetitively which I think I really don't like.

00:01:10.890 --> 00:01:12.500
Toe do it right now.

00:01:12.500 --> 00:01:19.370
So let's get started with a single recipe ingredients and then I'm going toe get back to

00:01:19.370 --> 00:01:25.310
you and going to see your assignments and what you have done and you have created No let's

00:01:25.310 --> 00:01:28.430
get started and started sending the single recipe screen.

00:01:28.430 --> 00:01:32.370
We're going to go back toe way were before.

00:01:32.370 --> 00:01:35.880
And I think we need something over here,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:37.300
like this one salads,

00:01:37.300 --> 00:01:39.550
and I'm going to replicate this.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:42.490
Let's replicate deserves this time.

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:53.250
So I'm going to replicate this one and let's zoom in and I'm going to call it single.

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.010
Oops.

00:01:57.010 --> 00:01:57.950
What happened?

00:01:57.950 --> 00:02:00.750
Single.

00:02:00.750 --> 00:02:05.900
That would be okay.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:09.950
So first thing is that we don't need this at the top.

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:11.760
Also,

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:13.170
our this image,

00:02:13.170 --> 00:02:14.750
it is going to go vied.

00:02:14.750 --> 00:02:17.570
We also don't need this one.

00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:21.990
And this is going to stay over here the same.

00:02:21.990 --> 00:02:24.050
This is going to stay over here the same.

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:25.050
Uh,

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.350
this is going toe.

00:02:26.350 --> 00:02:27.350
Go away.

00:02:27.350 --> 00:02:31.650
And now you're going to move it up like this,

00:02:31.650 --> 00:02:37.850
and we're going to expand it by pressing shift.

00:02:37.850 --> 00:02:40.780
Let's see how perfect expands.

00:02:40.780 --> 00:02:41.250
Okay,

00:02:41.250 --> 00:02:42.650
so this is this Look scored.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:43.540
Now,

00:02:43.540 --> 00:02:45.800
we don't need the rounded corners over here,

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:50.460
so we're going to go inside this mosque.

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:53.750
Let's use zero.

00:02:53.750 --> 00:02:56.100
So we have street corners.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:59.200
This arrow is going to be white now,

00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:08.130
and no,

00:03:08.130 --> 00:03:09.720
we need to enlarge this image.

00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:15.260
So what we're going to do is we are going to seeing this mosque group,

00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:16.320
this rectangle over here,

00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:16.760
actually,

00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:17.460
and we're going toe,

00:03:17.460 --> 00:03:20.960
drag it at the bottom like this.

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:28.470
So let's create a T 100 then height or dissect angle.

00:03:28.470 --> 00:03:35.950
Let's resize this image or here,

00:03:35.950 --> 00:03:36.750
like this.

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:39.850
Move it inside it.

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.650
Let's gene the height of this overly,

00:03:44.650 --> 00:03:46.290
okay?

00:03:46.290 --> 00:03:53.310
And then we are also going to move these this title over here this hard.

00:03:53.310 --> 00:04:00.650
I go on this all these three at the bottom over here somewhere,

00:04:00.650 --> 00:04:06.140
And it is our Dag the stag featured tag.

00:04:06.140 --> 00:04:11.060
We also need to move it over here like this.

00:04:11.060 --> 00:04:13.800
Okay,

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:14.750
so this is done.

00:04:14.750 --> 00:04:21.300
One more thing is that we need to change over overly now because we want to show our these

00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.530
icons at the top.

00:04:22.530 --> 00:04:24.810
So I'm going to go to this overlay.

00:04:24.810 --> 00:04:26.100
Go to this overlay.

00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.340
This is actually linear.

00:04:27.340 --> 00:04:31.000
So I'm going to move this gray at the top over here.

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:31.450
Now,

00:04:31.450 --> 00:04:33.730
uh,

00:04:33.730 --> 00:04:35.510
somewhere over here like this,

00:04:35.510 --> 00:04:50.900
Why it is going to be in this area there like this make it a bit darker like this because

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:52.030
we have very big image.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:52.290
No.

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.440
Okay,

00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:57.050
so now I think our back arrow is a large visible now,

00:04:57.050 --> 00:04:58.650
Um,

00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.600
Okay.

00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:03.860
So if you want to make it a bit more necks.

00:05:03.860 --> 00:05:08.750
Let's try to use a big darker over here like this.

00:05:08.750 --> 00:05:12.930
Like this.

00:05:12.930 --> 00:05:14.010
It's up to you.

00:05:14.010 --> 00:05:14.570
It's up to you.

00:05:14.570 --> 00:05:16.050
What you want to do here?

00:05:16.050 --> 00:05:17.120
Okay,

00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.860
so I like it this way.

00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:23.710
Now I'm going to add more icons when its share I gonna run this heart I got if you won't

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:26.600
like this fund So here is my share.

00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:30.910
I call on this one and my heart icon ISS,

00:05:30.910 --> 00:05:31.350
this one.

00:05:31.350 --> 00:05:37.750
So I'm going to crab boat off them ex Moved them inside.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:59.680
Jane Doe colored white like this there certainly won over grid lines grid and move them in

00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.350
the right.

00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:03.150
Art is going to be over.

00:06:03.150 --> 00:06:11.850
Let's move it over here and more this like that.

00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:15.810
This is good control.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:18.660
Ship four or control G to hide these.

00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.760
Now we have made the top section over here.

00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:24.650
Now we're going to move to the rest off the bottom,

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:27.850
so let's dilute this one.

00:06:27.850 --> 00:06:35.660
These three hopes I might Night need this one subscribes.

00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:42.050
Let's use it for ingredients.

00:06:42.050 --> 00:06:45.850
You're going tohave a navigational here.

00:06:45.850 --> 00:06:49.840
We're here somewhere,

00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.310
so we need this one.

00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.240
Let's dilute everything else.

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.750
Okay?

00:06:55.750 --> 00:07:02.850
Now we are going to draw something over here to show the stats off this.

00:07:02.850 --> 00:07:12.250
So we are going to have something over here like this 48 that's used 48 four.

00:07:12.250 --> 00:07:14.450
It is going to be white.

00:07:14.450 --> 00:07:21.960
And here we will show some of starts like home any minute for how many person servings and

00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:25.140
how many kilocalories this recipe is.

00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:27.910
So let's get it done.

00:07:27.910 --> 00:07:38.020
We're going to use this this and one more.

00:07:38.020 --> 00:07:50.350
Which is what was the 1st 1 time in this clock.

00:07:50.350 --> 00:07:57.650
We're going to drag all these three into Sigma and we are going to use this clock over here

00:07:57.650 --> 00:07:57.650
.

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:00.820
This one is going to be over here.

00:08:00.820 --> 00:08:02.150
This one is going to be over here.

00:08:02.150 --> 00:08:05.800
The rest of the thing is alignment and colors.

00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:14.650
So the killer will be this one.

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:17.190
This is actually medium green.

00:08:17.190 --> 00:08:21.750
We don't want them to be very highlighted because this is just an information.

00:08:21.750 --> 00:08:22.770
Use a door.

00:08:22.770 --> 00:08:23.330
Nieto,

00:08:23.330 --> 00:08:26.250
click it again and again or do something about them.

00:08:26.250 --> 00:08:31.790
And I think thes stores also need to be like this.

00:08:31.790 --> 00:08:39.750
That's used text over here.

00:08:39.750 --> 00:08:51.130
30 means 30 minutes that she was a spacing off.

00:08:51.130 --> 00:08:51.820
Six.

00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:59.150
We're going to use your Ramana Let's unblinking because we need a very small four door here

00:08:59.150 --> 00:08:59.150
,

00:08:59.150 --> 00:09:02.550
small size 14.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:06.260
And the color will be like this.

00:09:06.260 --> 00:09:07.720
Or maybe like this.

00:09:07.720 --> 00:09:08.940
Like this.

00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:09.750
OK,

00:09:09.750 --> 00:09:13.850
so same color as icon and I will go line it like that.

00:09:13.850 --> 00:09:19.050
Four person,

00:09:19.050 --> 00:09:22.350
four people were scored.

00:09:22.350 --> 00:09:30.380
Four people and 1.5 kilo calories.

00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:34.650
Something like that.

00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:40.800
Make sure you name these icons because right now I'm not naming them.

00:09:40.800 --> 00:09:42.590
This is energy.

00:09:42.590 --> 00:09:45.960
So no,

00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.600
I'm going to just align them.

00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:55.670
And according to this bar over here and just try to see what looks better to my like.

00:09:55.670 --> 00:09:56.470
You can see what here?

00:09:56.470 --> 00:09:58.670
That fighting over here is less.

00:09:58.670 --> 00:09:59.800
I have to just,

00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:00.810
you know,

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:02.380
fix these problems.

00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.890
The distance between is four.

00:10:04.890 --> 00:10:06.290
So it must be six.

00:10:06.290 --> 00:10:09.050
This is a bit much.

00:10:09.050 --> 00:10:11.900
This is one for seven six.

00:10:11.900 --> 00:10:19.560
This looks great Next,

00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:23.710
allowing them to see Okay,

00:10:23.710 --> 00:10:24.950
this looks better now.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:30.750
A lot better.

00:10:30.750 --> 00:10:33.330
Nine.

00:10:33.330 --> 00:10:36.350
From here we have 13 selects.

00:10:36.350 --> 00:10:39.190
Make it Dan.

00:10:39.190 --> 00:10:52.650
Nowhere here and also then from here Now this body is almost done.

00:10:52.650 --> 00:10:56.200
I have some problem.

00:10:56.200 --> 00:10:58.320
Or here here we have a lot of space,

00:10:58.320 --> 00:11:02.200
so I'm going to middle align it just using my eyes.

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:04.950
I'm not trying to be very pixel perfect over here.

00:11:04.950 --> 00:11:10.820
So now next birth this ingredients menu bar over here.

00:11:10.820 --> 00:11:14.870
So I'm going to use you can use a line.

00:11:14.870 --> 00:11:17.450
Let's use a line underneath it.

00:11:17.450 --> 00:11:21.520
Shift to make it straight.

00:11:21.520 --> 00:11:24.050
Let's make it two pixels.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:29.950
We are going to use the capital B Round color will be this blue color.

00:11:29.950 --> 00:11:32.050
What is this,

00:11:32.050 --> 00:11:32.450
Bill?

00:11:32.450 --> 00:11:33.240
No,

00:11:33.240 --> 00:11:34.670
we don't need Facebook Blue.

00:11:34.670 --> 00:11:35.400
What?

00:11:35.400 --> 00:11:36.960
We need our purple blue over here.

00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:39.850
I think we haven't added it into our colors.

00:11:39.850 --> 00:11:44.800
Let's use this and added to other styles.

00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.950
Second degree blue.

00:11:47.950 --> 00:11:49.780
This is our blue.

00:11:49.780 --> 00:11:50.830
This is not Facebook.

00:11:50.830 --> 00:11:51.250
Clue.

00:11:51.250 --> 00:12:00.050
So here we have it exchanged to our primary blue,

00:12:00.050 --> 00:12:01.050
This one.

00:12:01.050 --> 00:12:03.590
Okay,

00:12:03.590 --> 00:12:06.910
so this is going to be a little bit closer.

00:12:06.910 --> 00:12:09.070
Four bigs away from this,

00:12:09.070 --> 00:12:12.640
which should be 105 Okay,

00:12:12.640 --> 00:12:13.570
so this looks great.

00:12:13.570 --> 00:12:16.360
Now we need another one over here,

00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:24.250
which is going to be Let's move this inside this group with this group.

00:12:24.250 --> 00:12:39.050
So this is going to be inside over here.

00:12:39.050 --> 00:12:41.390
Recipe.

00:12:41.390 --> 00:12:41.590
Okay,

00:12:41.590 --> 00:12:45.150
so here we have it inside this recipe,

00:12:45.150 --> 00:12:47.480
A small section.

00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:48.370
So it is inside,

00:12:48.370 --> 00:12:49.550
actually small section.

00:12:49.550 --> 00:12:50.860
Uh,

00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:52.450
this line is going to move,

00:12:52.450 --> 00:12:53.770
and,

00:12:53.770 --> 00:12:54.450
uh,

00:12:54.450 --> 00:12:57.750
we also need some states over here.

00:12:57.750 --> 00:12:59.050
So,

00:12:59.050 --> 00:12:59.940
command,

00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:02.250
let's keep it like this.

00:13:02.250 --> 00:13:09.000
We're just going to change the colors and move this line moving life excluded.

00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:09.650
Moving line.

00:13:09.650 --> 00:13:11.970
Now I'm going to replicate this.

00:13:11.970 --> 00:13:20.690
Okay,

00:13:20.690 --> 00:13:20.870
Now,

00:13:20.870 --> 00:13:22.430
this is not going to be highlighted.

00:13:22.430 --> 00:13:26.390
So we're going to use some other color like this one medium green.

00:13:26.390 --> 00:13:27.850
This looks good.

00:13:27.850 --> 00:13:30.600
This ingredients is actually dark green,

00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.170
this one.

00:13:31.170 --> 00:13:36.150
So our menu is also ready.

00:13:36.150 --> 00:13:39.650
Let's see how much the distance is from here.

00:13:39.650 --> 00:13:41.580
It's keeping 36.

00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.080
We want to have good space around it.

00:13:44.080 --> 00:13:49.950
So user has nor difficulty is stepping over here in this section or here.

00:13:49.950 --> 00:13:51.060
Now,

00:13:51.060 --> 00:13:53.100
we're going to list the ingredients over here.

00:13:53.100 --> 00:13:54.310
This is very easy.

00:13:54.310 --> 00:13:55.640
This is just a list.

00:13:55.640 --> 00:14:00.050
I'm going to prepare the 1st 1 and rest you're going to we're going to replicate.

00:14:00.050 --> 00:14:02.870
So let's get started.

00:14:02.870 --> 00:14:04.780
And we are going to use.

00:14:04.780 --> 00:14:22.020
Or here 10 I was I was Salman Fish fish.

00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:29.750
Then we're going to use a line at a separate over here,

00:14:29.750 --> 00:14:35.760
and line is going to be discolor.

00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:38.600
Or maybe this discolor discolor.

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:40.740
So we want to be very light.

00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:44.350
We don't want it to be very prominent over here,

00:14:44.350 --> 00:14:46.700
because this is just a separator.

00:14:46.700 --> 00:14:51.730
So let's use common off.

00:14:51.730 --> 00:14:58.780
And I'm goingto Pete Dexter in the color to be something like this.

00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:09.740
I'm going to separate the roles from then something like this.

00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:17.270
Then we're going to use the same Let's have the opacity off 80% because this is just

00:15:17.270 --> 00:15:20.450
separate or 50% this looking better.

00:15:20.450 --> 00:15:23.650
I don't want it to be very prominent.

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:25.850
And ah,

00:15:25.850 --> 00:15:28.850
what was I was looking for?

00:15:28.850 --> 00:15:33.270
I was looking for this this addle over here.

00:15:33.270 --> 00:15:43.850
We actually want us use the same or c and we're going to place it over here.

00:15:43.850 --> 00:15:45.090
Oops.

00:15:45.090 --> 00:15:45.790
Or here.

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:46.250
Come on,

00:15:46.250 --> 00:15:46.650
TV.

00:15:46.650 --> 00:15:52.270
So this is going to be or hear something like this.

00:15:52.270 --> 00:15:55.720
So whenever user taps over here,

00:15:55.720 --> 00:15:58.670
it is going to be activated.

00:15:58.670 --> 00:15:59.820
So we have,

00:15:59.820 --> 00:16:00.950
For example,

00:16:00.950 --> 00:16:05.680
we have this item prepared or we have this with us.

00:16:05.680 --> 00:16:08.270
Next,

00:16:08.270 --> 00:16:11.980
use a bit more like this.

00:16:11.980 --> 00:16:19.540
Next.

00:16:19.540 --> 00:16:24.910
Group them together now from here to there.

00:16:24.910 --> 00:16:26.380
Mark Control G,

00:16:26.380 --> 00:16:29.240
this is our recipe.

00:16:29.240 --> 00:16:34.700
Be rest C B.

00:16:34.700 --> 00:16:38.570
So this is over.

00:16:38.570 --> 00:16:43.580
Recipe item we can also create if you want to create a component,

00:16:43.580 --> 00:16:44.790
you can create a component.

00:16:44.790 --> 00:16:49.000
And that would be helpful to And,

00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:49.350
uh,

00:16:49.350 --> 00:16:51.760
it's moving a bit up.

00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:53.250
49.

00:16:53.250 --> 00:16:56.040
Let's have 40 beard.

00:16:56.040 --> 00:17:02.520
Big distance between these and we really replicate this.

00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.850
Let's create this.

00:17:03.850 --> 00:17:05.030
Come on,

00:17:05.030 --> 00:17:07.990
D control.

00:17:07.990 --> 00:17:08.380
Come on,

00:17:08.380 --> 00:17:09.020
X.

00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:11.450
You're going to move it to style guide Over here.

00:17:11.450 --> 00:17:12.800
Oops.

00:17:12.800 --> 00:17:16.050
Like this.

00:17:16.050 --> 00:17:17.530
If you want to change the setting,

00:17:17.530 --> 00:17:18.130
for example,

00:17:18.130 --> 00:17:20.700
if you want to move these into a group again,

00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:27.980
I can call it icon and you want to move it over here in destruction at the bottom and the

00:17:27.980 --> 00:17:28.410
right,

00:17:28.410 --> 00:17:30.220
you can fix them.

00:17:30.220 --> 00:17:31.740
Similarly for this one,

00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:34.350
I'm going to fix it to left and bottom.

00:17:34.350 --> 00:17:36.570
So this is up to you.

00:17:36.570 --> 00:17:43.290
I'm not going inside these too many design details because I have already taught you.

00:17:43.290 --> 00:17:52.380
Now we are just going to replicate this like this morning D dd knee de and D.

00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.760
So we have list off all these items.

00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.270
That's I'm going to select all of them and I'm going toe.

00:17:59.270 --> 00:18:00.100
What is this?

00:18:00.100 --> 00:18:01.360
Let's delete these.

00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:03.870
Is that empty for hymns?

00:18:03.870 --> 00:18:06.450
They're select all of them.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.380
Oops.

00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:15.660
Let's lock this bottom.

00:18:15.660 --> 00:18:19.110
There was it is giving me some headaches.

00:18:19.110 --> 00:18:20.920
Also,

00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:23.050
this background I moved lock.

00:18:23.050 --> 00:18:27.490
So I want to select only these.

00:18:27.490 --> 00:18:30.550
Now I'm going to use this one.

00:18:30.550 --> 00:18:33.660
So let's improve it a bit more.

00:18:33.660 --> 00:18:35.060
I want more space,

00:18:35.060 --> 00:18:36.470
Dean.

00:18:36.470 --> 00:18:41.290
20 or maybe more than 20.

00:18:41.290 --> 00:18:42.550
Seems 24.

00:18:42.550 --> 00:18:45.810
Okay,

00:18:45.810 --> 00:18:47.660
so I think 24 looks better.

00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.660
So we're not just going to change these decks over here.

00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:57.950
And one more thing is I'm going toe increase the height of this one and also the background

00:18:57.950 --> 00:18:57.950
.

00:18:57.950 --> 00:19:09.230
So I went to unlock the background is the background is the bag number.

00:19:09.230 --> 00:19:09.960
It's a knock.

00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:13.460
It resize it like this.

00:19:13.460 --> 00:19:17.160
Then I'm going rogue in lock it.

00:19:17.160 --> 00:19:22.490
We need a button or hair which say's let's start cooking something like this.

00:19:22.490 --> 00:19:28.400
So we are going to use our standard button that school to our style guide.

00:19:28.400 --> 00:19:31.520
So when we try toe,

00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:33.030
change the hide off this,

00:19:33.030 --> 00:19:34.270
uh,

00:19:34.270 --> 00:19:35.780
this art board,

00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:37.690
you can see some off these icons.

00:19:37.690 --> 00:19:39.050
They have been messed up.

00:19:39.050 --> 00:19:42.220
Now this problems occurs when we have the scale set.

00:19:42.220 --> 00:19:45.890
So don't try toe whenever you have some.

00:19:45.890 --> 00:19:47.140
Some icon over here.

00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.160
Don't try to use the scale,

00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:52.240
but what this is going to be problem.

00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.100
So next school back that this actually happened.

00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:57.860
Okay,

00:19:57.860 --> 00:20:00.020
so here we have them back.

00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:00.940
Let's see,

00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:02.040
What are the changes?

00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:02.630
Okay,

00:20:02.630 --> 00:20:05.550
so one thing you have to notice is when you are trying toe,

00:20:05.550 --> 00:20:06.380
if you select,

00:20:06.380 --> 00:20:08.950
this item will hear this icon double click it.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:14.450
You can see if we if if we're trying to use right and bottom,

00:20:14.450 --> 00:20:17.350
the bottom is actually happening with this one.

00:20:17.350 --> 00:20:20.270
So it is this alleged toe this bottom over here,

00:20:20.270 --> 00:20:22.210
you can see the line coming down.

00:20:22.210 --> 00:20:25.390
So if I try to change top and bottom,

00:20:25.390 --> 00:20:26.350
it is going toe.

00:20:26.350 --> 00:20:27.390
Stay over here.

00:20:27.390 --> 00:20:33.050
So I think we should you stop and right rather than using So it will not go down,

00:20:33.050 --> 00:20:34.800
right and top.

00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.090
So this is better.

00:20:36.090 --> 00:20:40.050
You can see this one is stopping center and this one is left.

00:20:40.050 --> 00:20:42.560
We don't want it to be at the bottom.

00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:45.350
We wanted to be moving with the top.

00:20:45.350 --> 00:20:50.280
So let's move it now.

00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:54.050
Successfully and it is not going to go down like that.

00:20:54.050 --> 00:20:57.640
And that's Jane.

00:20:57.640 --> 00:21:04.080
This let's create a but no one here.

00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:09.610
We're going to drag our same button with the icon,

00:21:09.610 --> 00:21:11.930
but this time We don't need the icon.

00:21:11.930 --> 00:21:18.800
So what we're going to do is we're going to This is the instance we're goingto unlinked the

00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:19.510
instance.

00:21:19.510 --> 00:21:27.590
So because we need another button with without the icon so we can right click on this one

00:21:27.590 --> 00:21:32.310
and we're going to use de Dat instance Now,

00:21:32.310 --> 00:21:33.900
once the instance has been detected,

00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:37.810
we're going to remove this Ikonomou here and for this text,

00:21:37.810 --> 00:21:40.050
we're going to move it inside in the middle.

00:21:40.050 --> 00:21:42.720
This is going to be middle aligned text,

00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:45.280
and we're going to rename it legs.

00:21:45.280 --> 00:21:47.550
Start cooking.

00:21:47.550 --> 00:21:50.280
Okay,

00:21:50.280 --> 00:21:51.990
so right now it is a blue button.

00:21:51.990 --> 00:21:53.800
We don't want it to be Facebook blue.

00:21:53.800 --> 00:21:56.020
We wanted Toby our green color,

00:21:56.020 --> 00:21:57.370
which is our primary green.

00:21:57.370 --> 00:21:58.480
No,

00:21:58.480 --> 00:21:59.650
we have added over color.

00:21:59.650 --> 00:21:59.910
No,

00:21:59.910 --> 00:22:02.170
we're going to double click and go to this background.

00:22:02.170 --> 00:22:05.110
But and and rather than having the simple color,

00:22:05.110 --> 00:22:07.100
we can had a linear radiant.

00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:14.070
So I'm going to go with really ingredient and we're going toe have something like this from

00:22:14.070 --> 00:22:15.050
left to right.

00:22:15.050 --> 00:22:21.020
And we are going to use the same galera here almost the same a little bit.

00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.120
On the lighter side.

00:22:22.120 --> 00:22:25.150
You can see or hear this looks create.

00:22:25.150 --> 00:22:31.410
Now you can see this has darker shade on one side and water lighter and more sharper on the

00:22:31.410 --> 00:22:32.010
right side.

00:22:32.010 --> 00:22:34.910
So here we have the second button,

00:22:34.910 --> 00:22:42.170
and now what we can do is we can easily create another instance or another.

00:22:42.170 --> 00:22:45.900
You can see primary,

00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:48.520
but so this is going to be another component.

00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:49.860
So this is our master component.

00:22:49.860 --> 00:22:51.160
Let's call it Burton.

00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:56.750
A simple control command e.

00:22:56.750 --> 00:22:59.410
I'm going to move my Marcia component to my style.

00:22:59.410 --> 00:23:00.220
Kite over here.

00:23:00.220 --> 00:23:05.280
So the So here we have two kinds of pretence you can see side to side.

00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:08.790
One is this button with Icahn.

00:23:08.790 --> 00:23:10.890
Second is but in the dark icon.

00:23:10.890 --> 00:23:14.950
So let's school back or main designed.

00:23:14.950 --> 00:23:20.510
Let's align it in the middle like this,

00:23:20.510 --> 00:23:22.000
like in the middle.

00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:27.490
See if this is in the middle to I think this.

00:23:27.490 --> 00:23:30.110
Oops.

00:23:30.110 --> 00:23:32.920
Come on,

00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:34.410
G next,

00:23:34.410 --> 00:23:36.890
call them recipe items.

00:23:36.890 --> 00:23:40.050
This is going to be in the middle door.

00:23:40.050 --> 00:23:42.950
What has happened?

00:23:42.950 --> 00:23:59.590
Select all of these,

00:23:59.590 --> 00:24:01.290
Margie,

00:24:01.290 --> 00:24:03.770
and they're going to be inside a group.

00:24:03.770 --> 00:24:09.200
Make them in the middle Now it's in the middle.

00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:09.740
Now.

00:24:09.740 --> 00:24:12.730
The rest is that just you have to change all these icons.

00:24:12.730 --> 00:24:19.720
So in this over here we are going toe hide this factor and this ellipsis it is goingto be

00:24:19.720 --> 00:24:20.270
empty.

00:24:20.270 --> 00:24:25.320
So we're going to use Vied and we will have some straw which is going to be opposite.

00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:29.740
So it is going to be a better like this Like this.

00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.040
Okay,

00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:33.210
so if we have something empty over here,

00:24:33.210 --> 00:24:34.600
we're going to use something like this.

00:24:34.600 --> 00:24:56.960
The rest is that I just have to change all these text overhead way.

00:24:56.960 --> 00:24:58.520
So I have gained the text.

00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.140
Now we're going to test it in the prototype over here.

00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:07.190
So I'm going to link my desserts over here.

00:25:07.190 --> 00:25:11.550
This image I'm going to link it so this over here.

00:25:11.550 --> 00:25:16.450
So they expect this and move it over here like this.

00:25:16.450 --> 00:25:20.260
Start any minute smart and married Easing is out.

00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:23.210
Let's move to our Sorry,

00:25:23.210 --> 00:25:23.650
this one.

00:25:23.650 --> 00:25:24.450
It's not one.

00:25:24.450 --> 00:25:30.220
Let's play this Sellers means and deserts.

00:25:30.220 --> 00:25:31.850
So under desert screen,

00:25:31.850 --> 00:25:35.270
we're going toe klik This and you can see this is the effect.

00:25:35.270 --> 00:25:36.440
This is really nice.

00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.590
So we have to link it back.

00:25:39.590 --> 00:25:44.620
So if someone clicks the back button rather than going over here,

00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.660
it is going to go back to salads.

00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:48.160
The man screen.

00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:50.090
Oops.

00:25:50.090 --> 00:25:51.070
What is happening?

00:25:51.070 --> 00:25:51.620
This one.

00:25:51.620 --> 00:25:52.800
Let's dilute this.

00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:57.820
So this is going to go back toe desserts like this?

00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:05.670
Check this.

00:26:05.670 --> 00:26:09.950
Check this out deserves go back.

00:26:09.950 --> 00:26:11.800
Oops.

00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:14.360
So going back is a bit different.

00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:17.340
Smart and emir.

00:26:17.340 --> 00:26:22.660
Let's see what is happening at Cletus Going back from to 80 years old Here.

00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:30.450
We need to select the stab 80 actually.

00:26:30.450 --> 00:26:38.760
And this is going to go back to desert,

00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:40.380
not move on.

00:26:40.380 --> 00:26:44.350
But we're going to navigate to Smart.

00:26:44.350 --> 00:26:46.160
Any merit is in his out.

00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:48.660
What is the 2nd 1?

00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:51.550
So here we have one.

00:26:51.550 --> 00:26:56.010
And if we select the 2nd 1 we want to delete it.

00:26:56.010 --> 00:26:57.550
It's plus delete.

00:26:57.550 --> 00:26:59.550
That is all we need.

00:26:59.550 --> 00:27:04.470
Okay,

00:27:04.470 --> 00:27:06.660
So this is a fact I was looking for.

00:27:06.660 --> 00:27:18.300
You can see if we scroll down on this one.

00:27:18.300 --> 00:27:19.630
You can see we have this button.

00:27:19.630 --> 00:27:20.760
Let's start cooking.

00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.440
Very nice.

00:27:23.440 --> 00:27:23.950
Cruel.

00:27:23.950 --> 00:27:26.520
Okay,

00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.880
so that is going to end this lesson.

00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.700
We're going to create one more screen preparations,

00:27:31.700 --> 00:27:33.280
which is almost similar to this one.

00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.840
A lot of repetitive Urgh on the new one.

00:27:37.840 --> 00:27:41.660
Next one is going to be overly so let's move on to the next lesson.
