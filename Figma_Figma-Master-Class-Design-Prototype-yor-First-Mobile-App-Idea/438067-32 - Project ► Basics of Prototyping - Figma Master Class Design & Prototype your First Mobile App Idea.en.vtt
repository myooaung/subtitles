00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.650
Now you have learned all the basics off.

00:00:02.650 --> 00:00:03.850
Preferred hyping how?

00:00:03.850 --> 00:00:05.980
Toe transition from one scheme to another.

00:00:05.980 --> 00:00:07.050
How do you smart,

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:10.310
any made and how to overly screens On top of that.

00:00:10.310 --> 00:00:16.680
So know your assignment is that you have to create this three or fours screen set up and

00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:19.950
you you have toe share it with me.

00:00:19.950 --> 00:00:22.660
You are going to create something like this.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:24.960
What is happening?

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:27.850
So it will set on drag anyhow.

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:34.990
So here is three screens and then you have tow beard some overly with anybody you have,

00:00:34.990 --> 00:00:35.490
For example,

00:00:35.490 --> 00:00:36.020
the skip.

00:00:36.020 --> 00:00:38.340
This is overly so.

00:00:38.340 --> 00:00:40.100
They should be coming from the left,

00:00:40.100 --> 00:00:40.670
right?

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:44.540
Or wherever you want to place that you might want to place it on the top.

00:00:44.540 --> 00:00:45.970
The border bottom to top.

00:00:45.970 --> 00:00:48.870
So much is from the bottom off the screen.

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:50.080
It is up to you.

00:00:50.080 --> 00:00:51.660
So this is the prototype.

00:00:51.660 --> 00:00:53.030
Once you create this prototype,

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:55.450
you have tow click on the share prototype,

00:00:55.450 --> 00:01:01.930
and you can see there are settings on Lee people invited to this file and anyone with the

00:01:01.930 --> 00:01:09.590
link so slack this anyone with the link and copy link and share that links to me.

00:01:09.590 --> 00:01:13.750
So I'm I'm able to see and visually see your prototype.

00:01:13.750 --> 00:01:16.230
And I will be giving feedback to you.

00:01:16.230 --> 00:01:18.990
If you have any improvements,

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:20.160
I'm going to tell you that.

00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:23.130
So make sure that you create this protrude.

00:01:23.130 --> 00:01:25.580
I may be mentioned your name somewhere,

00:01:25.580 --> 00:01:29.850
so I can easily remember that this is the prototype off my this student.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:35.960
So three screens or maybe four screens or two screens tradition from one to another and

00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:37.450
third screen for the overly.

00:01:37.450 --> 00:01:38.900
This is your assignment.

00:01:38.900 --> 00:01:40.410
So let's get started now.

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:44.150
I'm reading to see your perfect I no.
