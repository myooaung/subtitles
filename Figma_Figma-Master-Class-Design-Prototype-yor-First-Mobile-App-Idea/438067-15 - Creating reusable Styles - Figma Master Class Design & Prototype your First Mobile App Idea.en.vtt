00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.250
in this video,

00:00:06.250 --> 00:00:07.640
we're going to talk about it.

00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:09.900
Must tiles that are going to be our colors,

00:00:09.900 --> 00:00:16.510
trials and textiles which you can use again and again and easy re apply to others text

00:00:16.510 --> 00:00:20.250
elements or other buttons or anything you have.

00:00:20.250 --> 00:00:23.350
So we can also create different effects.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:29.960
So let me show you by doing something so you can see I have used were here four colors.

00:00:29.960 --> 00:00:31.550
So if I select this rectangle,

00:00:31.550 --> 00:00:38.530
this is a fill color So how I can use it again and again So I'm going toe click over here

00:00:38.530 --> 00:00:42.010
This is called style and I'm going to click over here,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.530
create style So once I have this'll,

00:00:45.530 --> 00:00:56.460
I can rename it like steel I'm blue something like that and I'm going to have a style here

00:00:56.460 --> 00:00:59.210
So if I hover on it it shows still blue.

00:00:59.210 --> 00:01:00.040
Similarly,

00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:10.040
for these I'm going to create different names Second re orange color Then we have this

00:01:10.040 --> 00:01:24.050
primary primary blue dark and let's create another one Primary blue.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.020
So now you can see we have four color strives overhead.

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:30.390
These are our team style.

00:01:30.390 --> 00:01:32.730
So these are not local to this document.

00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.150
So these are our local design styles that we can apply in this document.

00:01:39.150 --> 00:01:41.850
So this is our project right now.

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.250
This is practice page,

00:01:43.250 --> 00:01:43.880
actually.

00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.740
So we have four colas trial,

00:01:45.740 --> 00:01:48.060
so you can see how we can apply them Easy.

00:01:48.060 --> 00:01:49.310
Let's let me show you.

00:01:49.310 --> 00:01:56.760
So I'm greeting rectangle also lips over here and I'm going to go to rather than going to

00:01:56.760 --> 00:02:00.040
fill I can I am going to goto.

00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:00.660
There are two ways,

00:02:00.660 --> 00:02:06.960
actually So go to style and select any colors you want.

00:02:06.960 --> 00:02:07.420
For example,

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.620
I want this color similarly.

00:02:09.620 --> 00:02:10.340
For example,

00:02:10.340 --> 00:02:11.570
I'm creating a burden.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:15.020
So I have to strict angle over here.

00:02:15.020 --> 00:02:18.190
This is a nice but and everything apply to it.

00:02:18.190 --> 00:02:19.190
It exists.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:21.270
And I wanted to be like this.

00:02:21.270 --> 00:02:23.250
So this is very easy for me.

00:02:23.250 --> 00:02:28.350
I don't want to remember this and you can see here we have primary blue dark.

00:02:28.350 --> 00:02:31.540
So the main thing is reusability,

00:02:31.540 --> 00:02:32.170
for example,

00:02:32.170 --> 00:02:33.950
I have applied the same color.

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:42.570
So this rectangle like this So what if I want to change the color and I want it to be

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:44.450
another shade off this blue.

00:02:44.450 --> 00:02:50.630
So what I can do over here is I'm going to click over here and then I'm going to click on

00:02:50.630 --> 00:02:51.750
this edit style.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:55.460
And here we have Option two chain discover,

00:02:55.460 --> 00:02:56.110
for example.

00:02:56.110 --> 00:02:57.250
I wanted Toby,

00:02:57.250 --> 00:02:58.980
Uh,

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:01.240
let's see this cover.

00:03:01.240 --> 00:03:05.610
So now you can see our primary Blue dark is totally different.

00:03:05.610 --> 00:03:06.790
Okay,

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:08.670
so go over here.

00:03:08.670 --> 00:03:13.340
You can also go it from you can also go toe changes from over here,

00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:21.270
so disliked this frame and go to local styles and you can click on the settings and let's

00:03:21.270 --> 00:03:25.050
change it back to something very dark like this.

00:03:25.050 --> 00:03:28.730
So here we have the color,

00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:35.600
size and how we can edit them and how we can reapply them and what effect it will have.

00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:36.160
So,

00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:36.870
for example,

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:40.220
if I want it to be some other colors So if I click over here,

00:03:40.220 --> 00:03:42.510
you can see it shows me all these colors.

00:03:42.510 --> 00:03:44.930
I cannot addict or change any color.

00:03:44.930 --> 00:03:47.260
I'm not open toe all the colors.

00:03:47.260 --> 00:03:52.080
So if I want to go back so I have to click over here d dead style.

00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:57.090
And now you can see I have my fill back so I can change its color to anything,

00:03:57.090 --> 00:03:58.750
and it is not attached toe.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.650
These two elements are these two colors trials.

00:04:01.650 --> 00:04:07.370
Now we're going to learn about textiles.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:09.560
So here you can see I have this heading.

00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.220
I have this text paragraph.

00:04:11.220 --> 00:04:12.000
It is regular.

00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.640
18 pigs,

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.970
Ills Roboto,

00:04:13.970 --> 00:04:14.790
die face.

00:04:14.790 --> 00:04:17.810
And this is Roberta Light 64 pictures.

00:04:17.810 --> 00:04:20.360
I can increase the size of 72 if I want.

00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:20.710
Oh,

00:04:20.710 --> 00:04:23.320
and this is my heading now.

00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.170
I can also create the same style You can seethe same button over here.

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:27.950
Back over here.

00:04:27.950 --> 00:04:32.720
And I'm going to have it heading big or heading 72.

00:04:32.720 --> 00:04:34.640
That would be easy for me to remember.

00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.450
Similarly,

00:04:35.450 --> 00:04:35.970
over here,

00:04:35.970 --> 00:04:37.180
I'm going to have it.

00:04:37.180 --> 00:04:38.200
Ah,

00:04:38.200 --> 00:04:40.600
better graph 18.

00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:47.080
So it means 18 pigs is the paragraph size and you can see I have to textiles over here.

00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:50.060
So whenever I want a new text over here,

00:04:50.060 --> 00:04:50.650
for example,

00:04:50.650 --> 00:04:56.750
I'm typing something being so I wanted to be a heading.

00:04:56.750 --> 00:04:59.090
So I'm going to just go over here,

00:04:59.090 --> 00:05:05.500
click on this and just slacked my hiding 72 and I'm going toe have all the settings I did

00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:05.950
over here.

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:06.820
Now,

00:05:06.820 --> 00:05:08.520
if you want to edit this style,

00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.070
for example,

00:05:09.070 --> 00:05:14.400
I have already created a style and I want to change it so thing is that you have toe klik

00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.420
anywhere over here,

00:05:15.420 --> 00:05:18.350
or you can just disliked anything which is easier way.

00:05:18.350 --> 00:05:22.760
And you can just click on this and I'm going to switch to,

00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:27.020
let's say black and I'm going to have 64.

00:05:27.020 --> 00:05:30.020
Let's use some other for,

00:05:30.020 --> 00:05:30.710
for example,

00:05:30.710 --> 00:05:31.480
like this one.

00:05:31.480 --> 00:05:33.050
This is a better one,

00:05:33.050 --> 00:05:35.620
and I think it doesn't have a backside.

00:05:35.620 --> 00:05:36.750
So let's use heavy.

00:05:36.750 --> 00:05:38.130
So,

00:05:38.130 --> 00:05:38.790
um,

00:05:38.790 --> 00:05:39.350
board.

00:05:39.350 --> 00:05:41.150
So this is looking good.

00:05:41.150 --> 00:05:46.550
So you can see this is how you change your style so you can go outside off this bone.

00:05:46.550 --> 00:05:46.780
Rio,

00:05:46.780 --> 00:05:48.010
you can select this one.

00:05:48.010 --> 00:05:49.400
Click this one,

00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.770
goto this icon.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:51.610
So this is a bit,

00:05:51.610 --> 00:05:52.350
uh,

00:05:52.350 --> 00:05:55.850
you can see a bit larger road to travel.

00:05:55.850 --> 00:05:57.750
I like it that way.

00:05:57.750 --> 00:06:02.920
So I just disliked it and go from these local style and change it over here very similar to

00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:06.180
these killers And these headings or this textiles.

00:06:06.180 --> 00:06:08.040
You can also create other styles.

00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:08.700
For example,

00:06:08.700 --> 00:06:10.100
I want tohave.

00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:11.570
Let's detach it,

00:06:11.570 --> 00:06:15.380
and I'm going to create linear ingredient.

00:06:15.380 --> 00:06:20.370
Now it's like this and I'm going to change the color to this one going toe.

00:06:20.370 --> 00:06:21.670
Increase the opacity.

00:06:21.670 --> 00:06:22.400
So no,

00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.710
we have created over here and select disc radiant and again I'm going to go to styles and

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:28.960
let's beard,

00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:30.350
ingredient or here.

00:06:30.350 --> 00:06:34.050
So I have my greedy in style similarly like this.

00:06:34.050 --> 00:06:36.050
So if you want to apply to this one,

00:06:36.050 --> 00:06:39.650
I'm going to click over here and this is my bottom with ingredient.

00:06:39.650 --> 00:06:43.510
And let's add some more things over here.

00:06:43.510 --> 00:06:44.140
For example,

00:06:44.140 --> 00:06:47.930
I want let's detach it and I want some effects.

00:06:47.930 --> 00:06:48.640
For example,

00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:50.750
I want shadows over here,

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:53.850
so I am going to have drop shadow,

00:06:53.850 --> 00:06:58.100
and that is going to be a bit darker.

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:06.200
Drop shadow that's used something like this and I'm going toe have blood off 50.

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.480
Let's reduce it to 30.

00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:15.350
Exclusive to 25 35 Looking good.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:17.750
Let's move it down a bit.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:24.190
6 18 Now we have created the drop shadow.

00:07:24.190 --> 00:07:25.600
Let's clear style for it.

00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:31.530
We have been too good style and click on this same plus icon to create a style.

00:07:31.530 --> 00:07:32.450
So this is our,

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:33.560
ah,

00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.190
drop shadow Four buttons,

00:07:37.190 --> 00:07:38.350
something like that.

00:07:38.350 --> 00:07:40.210
So we have another style.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:43.450
So if we go outside of the scandals and click over here,

00:07:43.450 --> 00:07:44.120
you can see no,

00:07:44.120 --> 00:07:45.920
we have a fact styles color,

00:07:45.920 --> 00:07:47.350
size and textiles.

00:07:47.350 --> 00:07:51.940
So these are different kind of styles you can try out over here,

00:07:51.940 --> 00:07:55.490
and you can reapply them to any I think you want.

00:07:55.490 --> 00:07:56.010
For example,

00:07:56.010 --> 00:07:59.180
I go to this effects and just like this and we have this shadow,

00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:02.350
I don't want to remember the values off this shadow again and again.

00:08:02.350 --> 00:08:08.190
So this is a very good concept in any and powerful concept of stigma.

00:08:08.190 --> 00:08:12.510
And I really love how they have used these effects styles,

00:08:12.510 --> 00:08:12.760
colors,

00:08:12.760 --> 00:08:15.900
trials and textile local textiles separately.

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:19.780
So I hope you have understood the concept off style and how to reuse them.

00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:21.850
Let's move on to the next lesson.
