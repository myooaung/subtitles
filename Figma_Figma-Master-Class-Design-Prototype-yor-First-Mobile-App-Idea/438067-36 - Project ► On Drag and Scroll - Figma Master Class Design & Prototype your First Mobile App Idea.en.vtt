00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.600
Now is the time for your next assignment.

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.990
And your assignment is that you have already learned drag function like this.

00:00:07.990 --> 00:00:11.240
You can see where here in this prototype drag function.

00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.220
And this is your first assignment that you have to create a file.

00:00:15.220 --> 00:00:17.660
You can clear this simply.

00:00:17.660 --> 00:00:20.780
I just want to know that you have understood the concept.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.750
All you can create an email,

00:00:22.750 --> 00:00:23.650
whatever you want,

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.430
so drag and drag.

00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:29.680
So this is one portion off this assignment.

00:00:29.680 --> 00:00:30.040
Second,

00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:35.450
is that you have to create some this horizontal scrolling within a frame.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:37.910
So this is your next assignment.

00:00:37.910 --> 00:00:43.590
Create this and then you have to click on the share prototype Anyone with the link and copy

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:49.270
link and share with me the link in your discussion or in the assignment section or project

00:00:49.270 --> 00:00:49.780
section,

00:00:49.780 --> 00:00:54.540
whatever is available to you and I want to see what you have created.

00:00:54.540 --> 00:01:00.350
Make sure try to use your name somewhere so I can remember that this is from this student.

00:01:00.350 --> 00:01:04.550
So I am seeing farmer to your assignment waiting for it.

00:01:04.550 --> 00:01:10.280
Now keep designing and improving and keep prototyping.

00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:11.970
Like always,

00:01:11.970 --> 00:01:14.340
this is going toe cleared.

00:01:14.340 --> 00:01:17.450
A better world with good designs anyhow,

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:20.200
