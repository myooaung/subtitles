00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.210
in this video,

00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:07.710
I'm going to talk about how you can view or preview your fig,

00:00:07.710 --> 00:00:10.290
my design on an actual device.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.720
So there are many ways.

00:00:11.720 --> 00:00:14.870
So there is an app court Sigma mirror.

00:00:14.870 --> 00:00:17.520
So you have to download that on your mobile,

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:18.480
for example.

00:00:18.480 --> 00:00:24.040
You can see this is on your Mac devices or your iPhones.

00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:28.680
So you have to download this fig mom mirror for your iPhone.

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.850
And then you have to download the stigma mirror for your android abs.

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:36.220
So right now I have my android phone with me.

00:00:36.220 --> 00:00:42.540
I'm going to switch to that screen with my camera and I'm going to show you that how you

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:45.870
can views your this bird eyeball.

00:00:45.870 --> 00:00:46.280
Here,

00:00:46.280 --> 00:00:50.220
let me show you this prototype on an actual device.

00:00:50.220 --> 00:00:56.320
So there are a few steps that are going to help you view this because some some things are

00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:01.770
confusing and there are very you can see bad reviews for fig my app.

00:01:01.770 --> 00:01:03.280
I think they are trying to improve it.

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:08.250
Three stars over here and also 2.5 SARS or here.

00:01:08.250 --> 00:01:09.760
So they really,

00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.370
really need to improve this.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:12.250
But still,

00:01:12.250 --> 00:01:17.860
I think I'm going toe guide you through this whole process.

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:22.150
So let's switch to the other camera and see how actually you have to do it.

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:24.690
Now you can see my fig momentum.

00:01:24.690 --> 00:01:32.230
App is open on my android phone and you have this email and password you have toe type the

00:01:32.230 --> 00:01:34.130
password and the email off your fig.

00:01:34.130 --> 00:01:34.790
My account.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:36.120
I have already saved it.

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.020
So I'm going to press logging.

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.490
No.

00:01:39.490 --> 00:01:40.790
Once you log in,

00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.740
it is going to ask you that.

00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:47.460
Select a frame or component that direct Dax is directly on the canvas.

00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:49.450
So now you have to move to your fig,

00:01:49.450 --> 00:01:51.300
my ab over here,

00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.810
and you have to select the scandals over here.

00:01:53.810 --> 00:01:56.210
So I'm going to slack camera State of one,

00:01:56.210 --> 00:01:58.150
which is right now on my screen.

00:01:58.150 --> 00:02:04.650
And you will see that after some time off loading it has loaded this screen over here.

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:06.910
So once the screen is loaded,

00:02:06.910 --> 00:02:08.870
I can just a prototype,

00:02:08.870 --> 00:02:09.650
for example,

00:02:09.650 --> 00:02:10.750
tapping over here.

00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:15.840
It is going to animate and transition into different screens,

00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:18.370
although it is a bit legging and slow.

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:21.370
But I think you can view your upper right.

00:02:21.370 --> 00:02:23.750
We're here that I'm going to go to Skip,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.690
and you could see,

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:28.870
the sliding menu is coming up over here.

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:35.220
I'm going to go to settings and I want to go back and then I'm going toe,

00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:36.510
move this out.

00:02:36.510 --> 00:02:38.370
So it is a big slow.

00:02:38.370 --> 00:02:39.250
But I think,

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:40.350
um,

00:02:40.350 --> 00:02:47.200
you can view at least some off the working off it and you can see how it is actually going

00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:50.180
toe be viewed on a mobile app.

00:02:50.180 --> 00:02:53.190
I think they have to work on it a lot,

00:02:53.190 --> 00:02:53.880
But still,

00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:56.020
it is a very life preview.

00:02:56.020 --> 00:02:56.710
Your design.

00:02:56.710 --> 00:02:59.680
Some of the times when you are designing,

00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:05.170
you have to view your actual design on an actual device like you can see where here I can

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:07.930
clearly see what is the type size,

00:03:07.930 --> 00:03:09.350
what is a four size,

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:14.180
but that the staff media is enough for North these kind of stuff.

00:03:14.180 --> 00:03:20.180
So you have to see your prototype on a live device toe,

00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:22.210
actually see some off the things.

00:03:22.210 --> 00:03:22.720
For example,

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:28.060
you can see this button is actually good enough toe,

00:03:28.060 --> 00:03:28.650
you know,

00:03:28.650 --> 00:03:29.480
Tab or here,

00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.060
for example,

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:32.410
this circle icon over here,

00:03:32.410 --> 00:03:36.080
this one this close circle it is actually a good size.

00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:38.040
I can easily dap it for the finger.

00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:40.930
So These are the kind of things you have to see.

00:03:40.930 --> 00:03:41.450
For example,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:50.080
this phone for Chuy's this text size and thes margins on the sides off this device.

00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:55.530
So these are some of the actual things you have to see live on your device.

00:03:55.530 --> 00:03:57.950
So then you can go back.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:02.050
Hopes go back to this fig mab.

00:04:02.050 --> 00:04:06.850
You can log out and that is it.

00:04:06.850 --> 00:04:09.350
So I hope you have enjoyed this lesson.

00:04:09.350 --> 00:04:14.600
You have to download the stigma Miller app on your mobile device whether you are on IOS

00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:21.250
iPhone and make sure that the frame size your frame size you are selecting your art board

00:04:21.250 --> 00:04:25.330
size is actually the same as your device right now.

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:27.600
You can see this app over here,

00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.270
which I am actually trying to use is Google.

00:04:31.270 --> 00:04:34.750
I think it's actually let me show you.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:37.520
It is Google pixel to excel.

00:04:37.520 --> 00:04:45.030
So this is 400 lemon by 8 23 This is the size for my this android device,

00:04:45.030 --> 00:04:47.450
so I actually had toe figure out.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:48.970
Once I opened this over here,

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:53.980
I had to see which is the size that is actually going to fit on this device.

00:04:53.980 --> 00:04:54.970
Similarly,

00:04:54.970 --> 00:05:02.170
if you are trying toe tests on and iPhone 11 pro or eight plus you have to use that

00:05:02.170 --> 00:05:02.940
physical device.

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:03.360
Otherwise,

00:05:03.360 --> 00:05:06.570
is it is not going to fit toe the whole screen.

00:05:06.570 --> 00:05:09.240
It is going to be a bit outside,

00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:12.350
or maybe sometime inside the screen and leaving.

00:05:12.350 --> 00:05:14.250
Some black areas are outside.

00:05:14.250 --> 00:05:19.870
So these are the things about using fig mom mirror app.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.760
I hope you have learned something valuable from this lesson.

00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:25.750
Let's move on to the next listen.
