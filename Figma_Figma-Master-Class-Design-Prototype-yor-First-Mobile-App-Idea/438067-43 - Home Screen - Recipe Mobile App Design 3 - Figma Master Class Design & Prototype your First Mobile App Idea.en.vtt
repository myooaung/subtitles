00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.020
in this video,

00:00:06.020 --> 00:00:11.380
we're going to create this featured recipe off our app and let's get started.

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:17.440
We are going toe use one resume toe our fit.

00:00:17.440 --> 00:00:19.870
And now we are going toe.

00:00:19.870 --> 00:00:26.040
Create a rectangle over here and let's create a rectangle and it will be the size of this

00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:27.280
such bar over here.

00:00:27.280 --> 00:00:32.650
So it will be 3 39 and the height will be 216.

00:00:32.650 --> 00:00:36.630
So first we have this.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:42.850
Let's use the border radius of four and this actually is going to be the container off the

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:43.430
image.

00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:47.330
So this is actually going to be masking a lot of things.

00:00:47.330 --> 00:00:50.710
So this is going to be more our mosque mosque container.

00:00:50.710 --> 00:00:53.340
So let's grab the image and drag it over here.

00:00:53.340 --> 00:00:55.500
So we're going to go to our images,

00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:56.580
and,

00:00:56.580 --> 00:00:57.160
um,

00:00:57.160 --> 00:01:02.450
the image we are going to use is this one or this one.

00:01:02.450 --> 00:01:09.570
So let's drag and drop it on top off this one to have it something like this,

00:01:09.570 --> 00:01:09.790
like,

00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:11.480
bought off them both of them,

00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:12.550
and use mosque.

00:01:12.550 --> 00:01:16.740
And let's let this image inside this massive zoom out.

00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:18.270
So this is the image boundary.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.450
We're going to hold shift an option key toe.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.200
Move it where we would like to have it like this.

00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:31.960
Okay,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.990
so this looks scored.

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:34.240
No.

00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.810
We have created this main box over here.

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:41.290
Now we're going to have some overly effect on this image because we want to put some text

00:01:41.290 --> 00:01:41.690
over here.

00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.350
So what we're going to do is we're going to create an indirect angle over here at the top

00:01:46.350 --> 00:01:47.250
of this image,

00:01:47.250 --> 00:01:50.050
the same size off the image of a head,

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.050
and we're going to move this rectangle.

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:54.250
You can see this is the rectangle,

00:01:54.250 --> 00:01:59.110
and we're going to move it inside this masked group and call it overly.

00:01:59.110 --> 00:02:02.160
So once we have over overlay,

00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:04.630
we're going to use a linear Grady insulin,

00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:05.450
your ingredient.

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:13.150
And if we are going to use vital here and black over here,

00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:14.790
Okay,

00:02:14.790 --> 00:02:18.720
so we're going to have something like this,

00:02:18.720 --> 00:02:25.490
and we're going to change the direction a little bit like this,

00:02:25.490 --> 00:02:27.670
like this,

00:02:27.670 --> 00:02:32.190
and we're going to use multiply over here so you can see this looking great a fact.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:32.650
So,

00:02:32.650 --> 00:02:33.950
um,

00:02:33.950 --> 00:02:40.380
men thing is that we can also change where we want it to be.

00:02:40.380 --> 00:02:40.920
For example,

00:02:40.920 --> 00:02:44.750
I want this white color to be over here like this,

00:02:44.750 --> 00:02:50.050
and I want to add in a little a little bit creates color over here like that,

00:02:50.050 --> 00:02:52.750
and this is looking great.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:54.900
So this is going to be our overlay,

00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.950
which is going to help us have some text over on this in this section over here.

00:02:59.950 --> 00:03:05.960
So this is this is our mass group because everything will be inside this.

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:09.550
So we are going to keep on adding things in this mosque group.

00:03:09.550 --> 00:03:11.520
Now,

00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:13.990
we're going to create a simple shape over here,

00:03:13.990 --> 00:03:25.550
which is going to be our featured recipe tag featured recipe tag over here,

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:30.060
so you can see this is our shape factor shape.

00:03:30.060 --> 00:03:30.730
We're going toe,

00:03:30.730 --> 00:03:32.310
color it orange.

00:03:32.310 --> 00:03:38.370
And the value off this orange color is e a 93 development.

00:03:38.370 --> 00:03:42.770
So this is actually my primary second regular.

00:03:42.770 --> 00:03:43.880
This is orange color,

00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.000
and we're going to add it into the fill.

00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.740
So let's first added into other styles sick,

00:03:50.740 --> 00:03:53.170
angry orange.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:55.580
This is our secondly orange.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:03.150
So we are going to remove it and added into the fill over here this color.

00:04:03.150 --> 00:04:06.310
So we have this bar,

00:04:06.310 --> 00:04:08.560
and if we want to increase the height,

00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:10.870
we can use 20 years or here like this,

00:04:10.870 --> 00:04:14.860
we can also shorten it and move it like this.

00:04:14.860 --> 00:04:21.900
So let's call it Dag and we're going to zoom in and put our text overhead.

00:04:21.900 --> 00:04:26.260
D is going to be featured like this.

00:04:26.260 --> 00:04:29.150
And it is going to be Agent Romanoff.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:29.720
Not true.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:31.710
Big Yantra.

00:04:31.710 --> 00:04:34.750
Man Enough is going to be 14.

00:04:34.750 --> 00:04:43.050
It is going to be 10% because we want a lot of space in this section or here.

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:46.670
And let's move it like this.

00:04:46.670 --> 00:04:49.050
Let's make it 24.

00:04:49.050 --> 00:04:53.400
And next use white,

00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:55.080
which is going to be this white,

00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:59.720
this bluish white over here and next use,

00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:00.880
um,

00:05:00.880 --> 00:05:04.860
12 eggs from here.

00:05:04.860 --> 00:05:10.950
So I wanted to be aligned in the same area like this stacks over here.

00:05:10.950 --> 00:05:14.690
So let's use our rulers.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:16.680
This tax,

00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:24.470
this text must be a line with same lying almost over here.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:26.550
Or maybe over here like this.

00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:36.990
Let's keep the means over here because it is a button,

00:05:36.990 --> 00:05:38.190
so we don't need toe.

00:05:38.190 --> 00:05:39.590
Be much worried about it.

00:05:39.590 --> 00:05:41.080
This is just text.

00:05:41.080 --> 00:05:42.950
So we're going to align it like that.

00:05:42.950 --> 00:05:44.350
Okay,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:47.840
so next is it's ah Di does it?

00:05:47.840 --> 00:06:03.050
This will be a real Big 24 2% white.

00:06:03.050 --> 00:06:22.290
Let's see what is the distance from below 7 12 Also for this featured control,

00:06:22.290 --> 00:06:23.150
Camargue E.

00:06:23.150 --> 00:06:30.490
And we're going to move it closer to this one because it's a text item.

00:06:30.490 --> 00:06:32.520
We don't want to be worried about that.

00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:34.450
It is very close to the bottom.

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.660
Then we have 317 textual hair,

00:06:39.660 --> 00:06:40.750
which is going to be,

00:06:40.750 --> 00:06:51.050
um you can use your big toe 14 317.

00:06:51.050 --> 00:06:53.800
This is going to be again white,

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:59.350
and we're going to use over love icon over here.

00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.770
And,

00:07:00.770 --> 00:07:01.450
uh,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:02.870
let's see.

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:03.550
Where is it?

00:07:03.550 --> 00:07:07.350
It is this one.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:20.340
We're going to use a smaller version 16 pigs Ilves because we don't want it to be very big

00:07:20.340 --> 00:07:23.250
that she was white over here.

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:31.330
So I think in my actual designer used gentleman of over here like this.

00:07:31.330 --> 00:07:36.850
So this is looking I think this looks good,

00:07:36.850 --> 00:07:39.500
but you can also use through big toe.

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.050
Rebic taxed is looking better for me.

00:07:42.050 --> 00:07:44.000
Uh,

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.390
this one is in German of regular.

00:07:47.390 --> 00:07:49.930
You can also use medium if you want.

00:07:49.930 --> 00:07:50.200
Oh,

00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:55.220
this This is going to look back writing now Here's a design dip If you have some item which

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.930
is smaller and one is larger and they're on the same line,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:04.260
you have to align the bottom off them so you can see we're going to use the bottom

00:08:04.260 --> 00:08:05.450
alignment like this.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:07.920
But you can see now they're looking ah,

00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:09.310
lot below this.

00:08:09.310 --> 00:08:16.000
So what we need to do over here is we're going to grab a line like this and we're going toe

00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.830
align things that like that.

00:08:18.830 --> 00:08:19.590
Like that.

00:08:19.590 --> 00:08:21.430
Like this.

00:08:21.430 --> 00:08:22.320
Like this.

00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:23.810
Okay,

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.210
so hard is going to be aligned with this because it is not text.

00:08:27.210 --> 00:08:29.250
You couldn't have something like that.

00:08:29.250 --> 00:08:32.500
So let's hide the lines.

00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:34.250
Shift are now.

00:08:34.250 --> 00:08:36.560
You can see this is looking a lot better now.

00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:38.660
There's one thing we haven't added over here,

00:08:38.660 --> 00:08:40.650
which is shadow.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:44.280
So here is our featured tag.

00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:47.750
Let's rename rename them title.

00:08:47.750 --> 00:08:50.690
This is,

00:08:50.690 --> 00:08:51.450
uh,

00:08:51.450 --> 00:08:54.950
hard Icahn.

00:08:54.950 --> 00:09:07.550
So all these I will move them inside this mast group like that.

00:09:07.550 --> 00:09:12.160
You can keep them outright toe.

00:09:12.160 --> 00:09:13.190
That is not a problem,

00:09:13.190 --> 00:09:14.050
but for this.

00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.510
Dag,

00:09:14.510 --> 00:09:21.350
I think I wanted to be inside this idiot this mosque area because I wanted to be clipped

00:09:21.350 --> 00:09:21.820
over here.

00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:24.280
If it is extending outside of this border.

00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:27.250
Now we're going toe adds drop shadow to this group.

00:09:27.250 --> 00:09:28.030
So I am.

00:09:28.030 --> 00:09:33.710
What I'm going to do is I'm going to add the drop shadow to this mosque group rather than

00:09:33.710 --> 00:09:36.650
having to the rectangle.

00:09:36.650 --> 00:09:39.450
So we're going to add a shadow over here,

00:09:39.450 --> 00:09:43.450
and this time we're going to use 20%.

00:09:43.450 --> 00:09:45.920
Let's have a shadow.

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:47.820
Six pixels.

00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:50.700
Blood is going to be 12 like this.

00:09:50.700 --> 00:09:52.150
And,

00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:52.910
um,

00:09:52.910 --> 00:09:55.250
that's more Move it a bit closer.

00:09:55.250 --> 00:09:57.650
Blood will be 10.

00:09:57.650 --> 00:09:59.600
Um,

00:09:59.600 --> 00:10:03.310
let's use it double value for this.

00:10:03.310 --> 00:10:03.820
Why?

00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:05.370
So this is a very good trick,

00:10:05.370 --> 00:10:05.760
fool.

00:10:05.760 --> 00:10:08.260
And it always try to double this blur.

00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:13.100
And let's add a bit more color your hair.

00:10:13.100 --> 00:10:20.290
We are going to use discolor and use 30% for this one.

00:10:20.290 --> 00:10:21.950
It's used 50%.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:24.950
65.

00:10:24.950 --> 00:10:25.680
Well,

00:10:25.680 --> 00:10:26.650
look better.

00:10:26.650 --> 00:10:28.250
Okay,

00:10:28.250 --> 00:10:28.430
so,

00:10:28.430 --> 00:10:28.840
actually,

00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:36.070
I'm trying to use the same dream green color we have in our background and try to use a

00:10:36.070 --> 00:10:37.250
darker shade off it.

00:10:37.250 --> 00:10:47.850
Selection of 70% and I'm going toe move it more of a like this and that she was 50%.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:59.530
So I'm going to use to six the star green color 40%.

00:10:59.530 --> 00:11:01.560
So this is going to be my final settings.

00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.990
And if I zoom out,

00:11:03.990 --> 00:11:05.450
you can see this is looking great.

00:11:05.450 --> 00:11:09.600
Now the next part is very simple.

00:11:09.600 --> 00:11:13.220
We're going to use the same the same elemental hair,

00:11:13.220 --> 00:11:16.140
which is let's group this first.

00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:17.560
So we are going to crop it.

00:11:17.560 --> 00:11:18.000
Come on,

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:23.450
G and we're going to call it big rest.

00:11:23.450 --> 00:11:23.770
See,

00:11:23.770 --> 00:11:25.450
be.

00:11:25.450 --> 00:11:31.880
And we're going toe command and control T to create another one.

00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:36.980
And now we're going toe have a smaller screen,

00:11:36.980 --> 00:11:37.780
a smaller,

00:11:37.780 --> 00:11:40.350
smaller version of this one.

00:11:40.350 --> 00:11:47.890
And we will remove this featured over here So the stag will be moved and I would lay

00:11:47.890 --> 00:11:49.250
everything will be seem.

00:11:49.250 --> 00:11:51.280
And if we,

00:11:51.280 --> 00:12:00.260
um that's try toe make it a bit smaller like this.

00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:07.350
Now you can see there's a problem that we are having this squished.

00:12:07.350 --> 00:12:09.720
Icahn's over here.

00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.540
So to fix this,

00:12:11.540 --> 00:12:16.860
we are going to double click on this one and we are going toe have Jane,

00:12:16.860 --> 00:12:17.950
this constraints.

00:12:17.950 --> 00:12:22.150
So this is going to be right bottom.

00:12:22.150 --> 00:12:24.680
And for this group,

00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:31.460
you can see it's a skills were going toe have it fixed size,

00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:38.950
so let's no try to scale it.

00:12:38.950 --> 00:12:43.820
You can see it is trying to stay in the same area.

00:12:43.820 --> 00:12:46.750
It is not squishing or changing its shape.

00:12:46.750 --> 00:12:47.910
No,

00:12:47.910 --> 00:12:50.950
let's use this like that.

00:12:50.950 --> 00:12:56.890
No,

00:12:56.890 --> 00:12:59.230
we have our smaller section.

00:12:59.230 --> 00:12:59.630
We're here.

00:12:59.630 --> 00:13:02.550
Let's zoom in and fix some of the problems or here.

00:13:02.550 --> 00:13:09.550
So this is actually title is going to be at the bottom like thistle here.

00:13:09.550 --> 00:13:14.600
This is going to be inside the image and it will have automated.

00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.370
Let's use this automate and know.

00:13:16.370 --> 00:13:19.710
You can see it is fixed for this one.

00:13:19.710 --> 00:13:27.650
You can see we're going toe on group command shift control shift G and this is actually

00:13:27.650 --> 00:13:29.270
happening due to this clip contact.

00:13:29.270 --> 00:13:33.550
So we have a frame and the script content exactly having this issue.

00:13:33.550 --> 00:13:38.250
So let's move it over here.

00:13:38.250 --> 00:13:41.550
More water of them like this.

00:13:41.550 --> 00:13:48.510
This is looking better.

00:13:48.510 --> 00:13:54.500
Let's see how much the spacing we have over here then and between them.

00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.050
Five.

00:13:55.050 --> 00:13:57.670
So now it is.

00:13:57.670 --> 00:14:04.570
You hear this?

00:14:04.570 --> 00:14:08.050
So we have six now,

00:14:08.050 --> 00:14:11.050
so let's move one Pigs it over here.

00:14:11.050 --> 00:14:15.080
This heart is going to be six pigs.

00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:23.150
It is 10 picks is they have small board of them.

00:14:23.150 --> 00:14:27.250
Wonder 34 on three.

00:14:27.250 --> 00:14:29.480
Okay,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.250
so this location is looking create.

00:14:31.250 --> 00:14:34.100
So now we have this.

00:14:34.100 --> 00:14:37.700
Um Okay,

00:14:37.700 --> 00:14:41.730
so let's where is this title?

00:14:41.730 --> 00:14:47.890
So title is also going to be fixed this weed out of it.

00:14:47.890 --> 00:14:55.950
This title will be chilly beef and the four size will be 16.

00:14:55.950 --> 00:14:58.750
And it will be John.

00:14:58.750 --> 00:15:09.540
Trauma live and color will be this medium green.

00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.300
Now we're going to create a textile,

00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:14.600
which we already have.

00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:18.580
But this time it is going to be Uh huh.

00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:19.640
No.

00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:21.430
16 pigs,

00:15:21.430 --> 00:15:26.530
ill paragraph so or normal text.

00:15:26.530 --> 00:15:28.480
So this is actually of a normal text.

00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:31.620
So this is going to be our title.

00:15:31.620 --> 00:15:34.120
Or if we can also use something like,

00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:37.230
um uh,

00:15:37.230 --> 00:15:41.310
small title like this.

00:15:41.310 --> 00:15:43.070
Ah,

00:15:43.070 --> 00:15:44.880
Bankoff Normal will be good to.

00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:47.030
So once we have this,

00:15:47.030 --> 00:15:49.880
we can replicate it,

00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:51.810
so we just need to replicate it.

00:15:51.810 --> 00:16:03.950
And now we're going to rename it small for a C B Just replicated.

00:16:03.950 --> 00:16:10.170
We have a distance off replicated command D,

00:16:10.170 --> 00:16:13.050
and it will be appreciated like this.

00:16:13.050 --> 00:16:21.360
14 must be inside this.

00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.650
So we have this major section over here.

00:16:26.650 --> 00:16:29.440
So what we can do over here is,

00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:32.060
uh we can also do one more thing.

00:16:32.060 --> 00:16:34.150
So if you want to create a component,

00:16:34.150 --> 00:16:39.170
our control all case before making a component,

00:16:39.170 --> 00:16:42.700
you have to make sure that everything is perfect.

00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:46.250
And you have made it right because ah,

00:16:46.250 --> 00:16:49.420
it will be difficult for you to see and change everything over here.

00:16:49.420 --> 00:16:52.260
So control all K,

00:16:52.260 --> 00:16:54.590
this is our small recipe.

00:16:54.590 --> 00:16:56.230
I'm going to replicate it.

00:16:56.230 --> 00:16:56.670
Come on,

00:16:56.670 --> 00:16:58.460
The small recipe.

00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:00.560
I'm going to move it over here.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.690
To my hips.

00:17:02.690 --> 00:17:03.480
To my style.

00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:03.900
Guide,

00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:05.600
we're here like this.

00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:07.180
No,

00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:09.200
I'm going to move back to my main design.

00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:11.340
And here is my main design.

00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:14.260
Let's zoom out and see what we have over here.

00:17:14.260 --> 00:17:18.110
So this distance is a bit too much for me.

00:17:18.110 --> 00:17:24.400
So I'm going to go to style guide and made some changes or here and I'm going to slack both

00:17:24.400 --> 00:17:27.350
off them and move them a bit Over here.

00:17:27.350 --> 00:17:29.350
This looks better.

00:17:29.350 --> 00:17:33.820
Now we are going to move back and it is looking better over here.

00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:36.780
One more thing.

00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:38.910
If you want to change the image over here,

00:17:38.910 --> 00:17:40.550
we will do that later on.

00:17:40.550 --> 00:17:44.600
So let's replicate this art option.

00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:46.280
I'm holding Arden Option key.

00:17:46.280 --> 00:17:48.390
14 pigs ill.

00:17:48.390 --> 00:17:51.430
I'm going toe 12 pixels between them.

00:17:51.430 --> 00:17:52.450
The distance,

00:17:52.450 --> 00:17:53.530
Come on,

00:17:53.530 --> 00:17:54.440
de toe.

00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:56.050
Have it copied over here.

00:17:56.050 --> 00:17:57.130
Now,

00:17:57.130 --> 00:17:58.810
we have three small recipes,

00:17:58.810 --> 00:18:01.700
and we can also add attacked over here.

00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:06.770
So let's under title under 30 minutes.

00:18:06.770 --> 00:18:12.600
So this is our title,

00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:15.000
and this is a Rubik 14.

00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.830
And we wanted to be a big 16 over here.

00:18:18.830 --> 00:18:19.180
Actually,

00:18:19.180 --> 00:18:22.180
we wanted to be big because it is a title.

00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:29.360
So this is actually this style no Big 16 but in text section on action text.

00:18:29.360 --> 00:18:31.350
So this is actually the style,

00:18:31.350 --> 00:18:34.940
and we will have more space from here.

00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:41.670
So let's use tarty two over here and stepped all of them.

00:18:41.670 --> 00:18:44.260
And we will use almost,

00:18:44.260 --> 00:18:47.760
uh 12 from here.

00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.100
This is looking better.

00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:55.650
And now what you have to do is we're going to select all of them command and control,

00:18:55.650 --> 00:18:56.020
G.

00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.850
And this is our a small,

00:18:58.850 --> 00:19:01.490
uh,

00:19:01.490 --> 00:19:02.330
small.

00:19:02.330 --> 00:19:04.790
So I have gaps.

00:19:04.790 --> 00:19:06.350
Walk on small section.

00:19:06.350 --> 00:19:07.790
This is our section,

00:19:07.790 --> 00:19:08.260
actually.

00:19:08.260 --> 00:19:12.730
So now we are if you look over here.

00:19:12.730 --> 00:19:14.690
So if we select all of these three,

00:19:14.690 --> 00:19:17.210
we can we also have this option or yes,

00:19:17.210 --> 00:19:20.820
we can James the distance between them like this.

00:19:20.820 --> 00:19:21.840
We can also change it,

00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:22.400
toe ed,

00:19:22.400 --> 00:19:26.970
which is looking a bit less for my best.

00:19:26.970 --> 00:19:34.360
So now we are going toe replicate this command or control D and move it under this one.

00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:41.350
So we will have again 30 too Bigs from here.

00:19:41.350 --> 00:19:50.050
And Jeanne thes headings like this.

00:19:50.050 --> 00:19:52.660
And let's zoom out.

00:19:52.660 --> 00:19:55.450
It's like this one.

00:19:55.450 --> 00:20:00.280
We're going to change the size off this one or here,

00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.520
and you can see size off this bottom.

00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:08.950
Never the same.

00:20:08.950 --> 00:20:16.850
But we have to change the size of this background because it waas stayed behind.

00:20:16.850 --> 00:20:19.920
Okay,

00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:21.500
so we have completed this.

00:20:21.500 --> 00:20:23.330
Let's select this.

00:20:23.330 --> 00:20:24.050
Um,

00:20:24.050 --> 00:20:26.840
that's Collab collapsed.

00:20:26.840 --> 00:20:29.610
These and we're going to select this bottom navigation.

00:20:29.610 --> 00:20:33.920
And we're going to select this fixed position when schooling because it is going to be at

00:20:33.920 --> 00:20:35.550
the top and it is going to be fixed.

00:20:35.550 --> 00:20:37.830
I have never We want to move this.

00:20:37.830 --> 00:20:44.640
So let's try to view this in a prototype and we will see what is happening Now.

00:20:44.640 --> 00:20:47.070
You can see we have this navigation at the bottom.

00:20:47.070 --> 00:20:48.350
So if we try to school,

00:20:48.350 --> 00:20:54.470
we are screwing inside this you can see you can see we're scrolling inside This So this is

00:20:54.470 --> 00:20:56.660
going to Stace over here.

00:20:56.660 --> 00:20:59.080
If you want tohave something at the top,

00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:00.310
you can slack that too.

00:21:00.310 --> 00:21:01.450
But right now,

00:21:01.450 --> 00:21:06.760
I think this is better to have this universal navigation at the bottom.

00:21:06.760 --> 00:21:12.000
You can see now the only thing left it is that you have to change those images,

00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.690
which is a piece of cake for you.

00:21:13.690 --> 00:21:14.110
Now,

00:21:14.110 --> 00:21:18.030
what we're going to do is we're going to change all the images for these recipes,

00:21:18.030 --> 00:21:22.440
and we're also going to quickly change the bottom titles over here.

00:21:22.440 --> 00:21:25.050
So I'm going to show you how to change the image.

00:21:25.050 --> 00:21:30.350
We're going to double click and go to this mosque group and click this image or here.

00:21:30.350 --> 00:21:35.430
And I have found a very nice trick that if you drag and drop your image on this image,

00:21:35.430 --> 00:21:38.640
feel it is going to be frittered very easily.

00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:42.940
So it is going toe fill it at a good space.

00:21:42.940 --> 00:21:48.750
So let me show you when demonstrate what I actually want toe say right now.

00:21:48.750 --> 00:21:53.950
So let's drag this image and drop it over here.

00:21:53.950 --> 00:21:55.910
So if I try to drop it over here,

00:21:55.910 --> 00:21:57.930
you can see this is going to happen.

00:21:57.930 --> 00:21:58.470
Imagery,

00:21:58.470 --> 00:22:04.030
size and everything is going toe Go over here and they're the best thing.

00:22:04.030 --> 00:22:12.110
Our best thing you can do over here is just title drag and drop it on this image way.

00:22:12.110 --> 00:22:14.580
Now you can see this is looking better.

00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:18.040
This is not what I what happened last time.

00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:18.940
Similarly,

00:22:18.940 --> 00:22:19.820
for this one,

00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:22.050
we are going to slack this image.

00:22:22.050 --> 00:22:24.370
Uh,

00:22:24.370 --> 00:22:25.350
this mass group.

00:22:25.350 --> 00:22:30.860
And if you want to direct this like the image you can hold control or command key and go to

00:22:30.860 --> 00:22:31.930
this end this,

00:22:31.930 --> 00:22:37.320
select this image and we're going to go back and select another image.

00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:39.790
Let's slacked on this one.

00:22:39.790 --> 00:22:45.340
So I'm going to drop it on this image field and you can see this is this is better.

00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:48.330
This is easier for me If you still want to adjust it.

00:22:48.330 --> 00:22:49.820
You can slack this image.

00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:51.330
Go this image,

00:22:51.330 --> 00:22:55.140
fill on goto crop and you can place the image,

00:22:55.140 --> 00:22:55.670
for example.

00:22:55.670 --> 00:22:57.550
I want to place this section.

00:22:57.550 --> 00:23:00.550
I want to make it larger on shift,

00:23:00.550 --> 00:23:02.220
Um,

00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:05.350
like this and press cross like that.

00:23:05.350 --> 00:23:08.030
So this is another way if you want to customize it.

00:23:08.030 --> 00:23:10.860
But right now I am I want to quickly placed these images.

00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:12.410
I want to change these numbers.

00:23:12.410 --> 00:23:14.390
I want to change these tax over here.

00:23:14.390 --> 00:23:15.900
Similarly,

00:23:15.900 --> 00:23:16.620
for this one,

00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.370
we're going to do the same trick,

00:23:18.370 --> 00:23:20.810
and we're going to go to this image or here.

00:23:20.810 --> 00:23:22.070
This is the image file.

00:23:22.070 --> 00:23:23.270
This is the image free,

00:23:23.270 --> 00:23:23.860
lower here.

00:23:23.860 --> 00:23:28.110
We're going to drag and drop whatever we have on this image filled,

00:23:28.110 --> 00:23:33.550
and it places it in a lot of good way for me.

00:23:33.550 --> 00:23:36.550
I think this is a great placement.

00:23:36.550 --> 00:23:39.660
So if I want to drop it and change it,

00:23:39.660 --> 00:23:41.990
I'm going to change it like this.

00:23:41.990 --> 00:24:07.680
This is looking better for this.

00:24:07.680 --> 00:24:09.540
Under 30 minutes will be dark green,

00:24:09.540 --> 00:24:13.070
not using black over here.

00:24:13.070 --> 00:24:14.450
This is actually are black.

00:24:14.450 --> 00:24:18.130
So that is all for this screen.

00:24:18.130 --> 00:24:20.490
We have completed successfully this screen,

00:24:20.490 --> 00:24:25.290
and let's view our prototype in screen and see how it looks.

00:24:25.290 --> 00:24:26.650
We have toe test,

00:24:26.650 --> 00:24:27.200
few things,

00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:27.840
for example,

00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.290
the top notch over here.

00:24:29.290 --> 00:24:33.070
Okay,

00:24:33.070 --> 00:24:35.070
Now you can see this is our local jumps,

00:24:35.070 --> 00:24:38.650
and it is just behind this top notch part over here.

00:24:38.650 --> 00:24:44.670
So I wanted to be over here in this section because we have toe take care off this in our

00:24:44.670 --> 00:24:46.340
design first I used to place.

00:24:46.340 --> 00:24:48.010
I placed it over here,

00:24:48.010 --> 00:24:49.400
so it was,

00:24:49.400 --> 00:24:49.950
you know,

00:24:49.950 --> 00:24:54.040
getting got by this section.

00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:55.660
So I moved it down over here.

00:24:55.660 --> 00:24:59.990
So this is how we are going to use and design the screen.

00:24:59.990 --> 00:25:01.850
The others next three screens,

00:25:01.850 --> 00:25:06.940
they are just you can see just very similar to this one.

00:25:06.940 --> 00:25:08.820
We have everything better up.

00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.160
We just need toe.

00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:13.850
Make sure that this stop navigation is going to move.

00:25:13.850 --> 00:25:16.770
And also the bottom one if we have toe.

00:25:16.770 --> 00:25:19.830
So this is going to be the next session.

00:25:19.830 --> 00:25:22.180
I think this these lessons are very long.

00:25:22.180 --> 00:25:23.760
But you have to stay with me.

00:25:23.760 --> 00:25:25.170
You have to build it,

00:25:25.170 --> 00:25:29.060
and you have to learn and see how I actually do it.

00:25:29.060 --> 00:25:31.470
So let's move on to the next lesson.
