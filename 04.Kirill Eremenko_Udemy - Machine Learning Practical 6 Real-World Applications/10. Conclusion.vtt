00:01.140 --> 00:03.420
So let's conclude the section right.

00:03.450 --> 00:11.910
So first of all we used it to Colonel and without a drop out and we saw that the accuracy reached nine

00:11.910 --> 00:13.410
on point nine five.

00:13.410 --> 00:17.530
However the test accuracy reached point nine one one OK.

00:17.700 --> 00:23.950
The next step is we ran a 64 kernel without a dropout.

00:23.970 --> 00:28.000
So we found that the accuracy was during training was Point 9 6.

00:28.020 --> 00:36.360
However the test accuracy was Point 9 1 6 to improve the accuracy of the test accuracy a little bit.

00:36.480 --> 00:41.100
We improved obviously the Cheney accuracy a little bit but with 9:06 but we improve the accuracy a little

00:41.100 --> 00:42.330
bit which is what we care about.

00:42.450 --> 00:48.860
Essentially essentially we care about the testing values of testing accuracy a lot more than the training.

00:49.040 --> 00:49.910
OK.

00:50.700 --> 00:55.920
The next step is we ran 64 kernel with dropout.

00:56.060 --> 01:01.200
So you will find that the model that training has been dropped a little bit over the test accuracy has

01:01.200 --> 01:01.940
been increased.

01:02.000 --> 01:03.800
Okay two point nine one nine.

01:03.990 --> 01:04.640
All right.

01:05.060 --> 01:05.680
OK.

01:06.030 --> 01:11.630
And as you can see here we have this kind of a prediction class and this is a true class.

01:11.640 --> 01:16.950
So again in summary we saw that pretty much most of them have been classified correctly except this

01:16.950 --> 01:20.490
one with the prediction class was two and the class was six.

01:20.490 --> 01:21.150
All right.

01:21.630 --> 01:30.270
OK so what we could do that we can we can take this very simple case study and actually expand it moving

01:30.270 --> 01:37.580
forward to add kind of more advanced features so we can add for instance color textures tile.

01:37.740 --> 01:44.430
We can look at more advanced kind of images and here I just kind of checked to.

01:44.480 --> 01:47.060
I want you to check out these two resources.

01:47.220 --> 01:50.110
One of them is what we call a deep fashion dataset.

01:50.130 --> 01:51.680
Let's go there and see.

01:51.690 --> 01:58.560
So this is kind of kind of a large scale fashion depression database that has way more images than our

01:58.560 --> 01:59.690
fashion Emin's data.

01:59.940 --> 02:06.300
So it has about eight hundred thousand diverse images and you can see here it's more it's more like

02:06.390 --> 02:09.660
it has more rich information so it has more of the texture for it.

02:09.720 --> 02:15.180
For instance has more of the fabric has more of the shape of the style and that's what you could do

02:15.180 --> 02:22.580
to build an advanced for example applications and advanced features within your within your model.

02:22.890 --> 02:25.560
OK that's again you guys can take a look.

02:25.580 --> 02:27.080
Take a look at this data.

02:27.090 --> 02:30.870
Obviously you would need to look kind of a step up our game a little bit.

02:30.870 --> 02:35.490
But again here I gave you an idea of how can we build a conclusion in the network that can be used to

02:35.490 --> 02:39.430
classify just simply take classes using grayscale images.

02:39.440 --> 02:40.130
All right.

02:40.440 --> 02:47.310
The next next point that I wanted you or an X website they wanted to check out is if you go to Wii U

02:47.400 --> 02:54.040
E that I and you guys can see here this is kind of an innovative solution of AI into fashion.

02:54.430 --> 03:00.610
OK you guys can see here you can simply upload your images and it can tell you for instance what the

03:00.620 --> 03:01.810
style is.

03:01.830 --> 03:03.930
It can tell you what's the lens is what.

03:03.930 --> 03:05.150
For example the color.

03:05.250 --> 03:05.890
OK.

03:05.910 --> 03:08.660
And can kind of describe to you what that product is.

03:08.670 --> 03:10.810
OK and a kind of a verbal verbal way.

03:10.890 --> 03:16.410
It's a little bit more advanced obviously compared to the network that we built.

03:16.410 --> 03:17.970
But it's pretty much pretty much the same.

03:17.970 --> 03:25.020
Same idea having kind of deep using deep learning convolution or networks to tell you or to classify

03:26.010 --> 03:30.150
images using a little bit more features compared to what we have.

03:30.210 --> 03:30.770
OK.

03:31.080 --> 03:35.770
Again you guys can check the websites very very interesting and that's pretty much all what I have for

03:35.770 --> 03:36.640
this case study.

03:36.770 --> 03:39.380
I hope you guys enjoyed it and see you in the next case study.
