00:04.360 --> 00:09.640
The global fashion industry is valued at three trillion dollars and accounts for 2 percent of the world's

00:09.640 --> 00:15.460
GDP the fashion industry is undergoing a dramatic transformation by adopting new computer vision and

00:15.460 --> 00:17.650
machine learning and deep learning techniques.

00:17.680 --> 00:20.620
In this case study we'll look at a hypothetical situation.

00:20.620 --> 00:26.500
We assume that if a retailer hired you to build a virtual stylist assistant that looks at customer Instagram

00:26.500 --> 00:32.810
and Facebook images and classifies what fashion category they are wearing either bags dresses and pants.

00:32.980 --> 00:39.220
The virtual assistant can help the retailer detect and forecast fashion trends and launch targeted marketing

00:39.220 --> 00:40.430
campaigns.

00:40.600 --> 00:43.740
In this story we're going to use the fashion immanence data.

00:43.810 --> 00:47.670
It's a data set that contains images of bags shoes and dresses.

00:47.860 --> 00:52.390
And we're asking the deep network to classify the images into 10 classes.

00:52.390 --> 00:57.280
Let's take a quick look at what I mean by this.

00:57.450 --> 01:01.230
So let's take a look at what we wanted to build.

01:01.230 --> 01:01.770
All right.

01:02.010 --> 01:06.580
So we wanted to build kind of an app per se or a model.

01:06.860 --> 01:07.540
OK.

01:07.590 --> 01:12.210
They can look at images and can tell us exactly what category in this image.

01:12.240 --> 01:13.160
Is it like a short.

01:13.170 --> 01:14.200
Is it a bag.

01:14.250 --> 01:15.470
Is it like a hat.

01:15.480 --> 01:16.250
And so on.

01:16.460 --> 01:20.130
So you guys can see here and it's kind of an image you know of like a model right here.

01:20.190 --> 01:27.190
And as you can see we wanted our machine learning or learning model to actually tell us OK this is actually

01:27.200 --> 01:28.090
short.

01:28.320 --> 01:31.290
And then here this kind of a bag this kind of a dress.

01:31.290 --> 01:31.730
OK.

01:31.950 --> 01:32.670
That's the whole objective.

01:32.670 --> 01:39.030
So we wanted to build kind of a kind of a model OK or artificial intelligence based deep learning model

01:39.390 --> 01:43.770
that can classifies images to different categories or different classes.

01:43.770 --> 01:44.350
OK.

01:44.820 --> 01:46.380
So what's the objective of this.

01:46.380 --> 01:51.480
One of the main objectives of this is that once we do once we do that once we classify for example that

01:51.480 --> 01:56.780
this human being for instance of it's like customer loves for example dresses OK.

01:56.790 --> 02:03.430
So that means we can do kind of targeted marketing to that specific customer.

02:03.720 --> 02:09.720
So for example if we classify this for example you know like lady loves let's say blue dresses then

02:09.720 --> 02:13.530
we can target different blue dresses to her.

02:13.530 --> 02:17.520
You know maybe of different texture different material and so on so forth is a lot of ideas that can

02:17.520 --> 02:19.110
be built around that.

02:19.400 --> 02:19.940
OK.

02:20.040 --> 02:25.410
Obviously in this case study we're just going to assume a very simple example that we have just grayscale

02:25.410 --> 02:29.760
images and we wanted to classify these grayscale images into 10 classes and categories.

02:29.770 --> 02:33.510
I'm going to dig into the data a little bit deeper as we move forward.

02:33.510 --> 02:34.320
All right.

02:34.950 --> 02:42.810
So a prime example of what we're going to be building is what we call the Amazon echo looks style assistant.

02:42.840 --> 02:43.310
Right.

02:43.590 --> 02:49.410
And I'm going to leave you for kind of a one minute video that shows you pretty much like the essence

02:49.410 --> 02:51.840
of what we wanted to build in a much much simpler for.

02:51.950 --> 02:52.390
Right.

02:52.710 --> 02:58.360
And afterwards we're going to cover how to scribe the problem in a machine learning terms.

02:58.370 --> 02:58.920
OK.

02:59.010 --> 03:01.840
I hope you guys enjoy the video and see you in the next section.

03:04.580 --> 03:06.630
Lexa going to rain tonight.

03:06.660 --> 03:08.270
Look at what's on my calendar.

03:08.300 --> 03:09.590
Got to turn the lights off.

03:09.810 --> 03:10.790
OK.

03:10.800 --> 03:15.030
Alexa helps with thousands of things and now she can help you look your best.

03:15.030 --> 03:17.000
Alexa take a photo.

03:19.190 --> 03:24.910
Introducing a first of its kind go with a hands free camera.

03:25.160 --> 03:28.040
A look takes photos using just your voice.

03:28.070 --> 03:32.420
It's built in lighting and depth sensing camera lets you blur the backgrounds to make sure your options

03:32.430 --> 03:36.710
pop giving you claim full length photos that are easy to share with friends.

03:37.890 --> 03:41.940
Plus get a live view or take videos to see yourself from every angle.

03:42.090 --> 03:47.740
Take a video.

03:47.870 --> 03:51.080
We've also created an easy way to get a second opinion.

03:51.470 --> 03:53.240
Introducing style.

03:53.870 --> 03:57.870
It combines the best in machine learning with advice from fashion specialists.

03:58.120 --> 04:02.680
Just pick two outfits and style check will give you a recommendation based on current trends and what

04:02.680 --> 04:03.950
flatters you.

04:04.180 --> 04:07.000
Alexa can also help you create a personal look book.

04:07.150 --> 04:12.040
It shows you what you want and when you can keep track of your favorites and take your closet with you

04:12.370 --> 04:13.300
wherever you go.

04:13.300 --> 04:16.260
Alexa what's my career the fastest route.

04:16.270 --> 04:18.400
Takes about 15 minutes.

04:18.490 --> 04:27.820
Plus Alexa is built in the cloud and always getting smart and so eco.

04:28.250 --> 04:30.070
Love your luck every day.
