Hey Guys welcome to the machine learning practical course.

00:03.840 --> 00:10.140
Super excited to have you on board and even more excited to see that you made this choice to Skaro into

00:10.130 --> 00:14.130
this as career and thinking machine learning skills to the next level.

00:14.220 --> 00:16.620
Were these practical applications now.

00:16.650 --> 00:19.350
I'm here today to give you a quick heads up.

how the machine learning skills are applied but you'll see the difference tiles of how these people

01:02.210 --> 01:08.370
have these top experts in the field are actually applying machine learning so you can get some unique

01:08.610 --> 01:10.320
characteristics from each one of them.
