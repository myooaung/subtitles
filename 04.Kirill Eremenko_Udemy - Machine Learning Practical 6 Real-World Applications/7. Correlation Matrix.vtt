00:00.810 --> 00:01.650
Hello everybody.

00:01.650 --> 00:02.910
Welcome back.

00:02.920 --> 00:07.400
Today we're going to finalize the process by building the correlation matrix.

00:07.710 --> 00:13.290
As you may remember the correlation matrix is a plot to show us the correlations between all of the

00:13.290 --> 00:15.310
independent fields with each other.

00:15.420 --> 00:17.660
We have build this coalition which would be four.

00:17.910 --> 00:23.560
And so we're going to leverage that and just use the same code with small minor changes.

00:23.670 --> 00:26.270
So let's see how it works.

00:26.340 --> 00:32.220
This is a code for the correlation which is again this is just you want to create a white background

00:32.220 --> 00:33.390
here on this line.

00:33.390 --> 00:38.970
Then we build a correlation matrix which is then the moment correlations of every single field in the

00:38.970 --> 00:40.500
data set.

00:40.500 --> 00:46.230
Now we have to remove Of course there are fields that are not useful for the correlation matrix.

00:46.230 --> 00:51.730
In this case you are going to be like normal the user identifier and the response variable which is

00:52.560 --> 00:54.240
everything else can work just fine.

00:54.240 --> 00:56.030
The correlation is.

00:56.340 --> 01:02.940
Now next we're going to mass the upper triangle which like I mentioned previously used is just the top

01:03.270 --> 01:04.660
right of the triangle.

01:04.740 --> 01:07.890
Given that there's a correlation matrix in this triangle is the metric.

01:08.010 --> 01:11.470
So we need that top right when we need one half of it.

01:11.580 --> 01:17.970
Then we plot of course each of the individual correlations which is each of the squares in the correlation

01:17.970 --> 01:21.920
Meijers then we give it a particular color palette of our choosing.

01:22.010 --> 01:24.270
Again this is something that you guys can just as you like.

01:24.270 --> 01:29.100
I would recommend just copy and page and see how it looks in your computer and then it depending on

01:29.100 --> 01:31.230
what your resolution is.

01:31.230 --> 01:37.340
Finally we have a heat map which shows the entire map where all our creative fields are used on.

01:37.620 --> 01:38.880
And that's about it.

01:38.880 --> 01:44.840
So it's time to see what the correlation to return so we can try and find something useful in this block.

01:45.650 --> 01:46.190
Great.

01:46.380 --> 01:48.390
So this looks beautiful like always.

01:48.390 --> 01:50.350
This is my favorite matrix.

01:50.490 --> 01:53.400
So let's look of all the squares right here.

01:53.640 --> 01:58.090
Obviously the best case scenario would be that every single field is independent of each other.

01:58.260 --> 02:04.830
And as a result all of these right here will be on the zero marker on this here meaning that they are

02:05.040 --> 02:11.990
not really whatsoever at least not linearly related but that is that some of them are highly highly

02:11.990 --> 02:18.240
that if you read which which is OK because if we look at the like on the right side we're going to see

02:18.240 --> 02:26.520
that the highest rate it's available in this particular chart is only around 0.2 meaning that the strongest

02:26.520 --> 02:31.370
relationship in this matrix is no longer that 2.2 2.3.

02:31.630 --> 02:33.570
Not any more than that.

02:33.690 --> 02:41.400
Now for the blue sky the Naini relationship you see that the correlation goes all the way down to negative

02:41.400 --> 02:47.150
zero point eight meaning that the strongest correlation available in this block is actually quite high.

02:47.430 --> 02:49.690
So let's see which one that is.

02:49.740 --> 02:54.060
Obviously if you just look at the platypi obviously tell that it's that big blue square here in the

02:54.060 --> 02:58.150
center and it shows us the relationship between.

02:58.170 --> 03:04.350
Let's see which column is the relationship between the entry you are right here and the IO as you see

03:04.350 --> 03:08.450
here in the Bible is very strong which makes a lot of sense.

03:08.490 --> 03:09.350
Why is that.

03:09.630 --> 03:14.380
Well if you're an Android user you are not going to be in Iowa.

03:14.850 --> 03:18.470
So for the majority of the time this is going to be one to one.

03:18.480 --> 03:23.880
Meaning that whenever you're on one of the Android you're a zero on the iOS.

03:24.110 --> 03:24.740
OK.

03:24.900 --> 03:28.160
Now this correlation is not exactly one to one.

03:28.170 --> 03:35.970
Oh that was like to say that because there's going to be very few users who own both in iOS devices

03:36.270 --> 03:43.380
and incendiary device and then maybe some users who own a third party type of device that I'm not familiar

03:43.380 --> 03:43.830
with.

03:44.040 --> 03:46.190
And as a result both of these will be zero.

03:47.070 --> 03:49.290
So it is not exactly correlated.

03:49.770 --> 03:53.400
So how do we deal with these particular fields.

03:53.590 --> 04:00.390
Well because the correlation is strong you will be better for us to remove one of them because this

04:00.390 --> 04:04.030
is what's in that and I emphasize almost because like I said it's not one to one.

04:04.090 --> 04:08.950
This is almost as having a call for male users and female users.

04:09.030 --> 04:15.720
Obviously if you're not part of the female user base you're going to fall in the Melk category for most

04:15.720 --> 04:16.830
distributions.

04:16.830 --> 04:23.440
So in those cases we only need one column meaning that is male or female.

04:24.090 --> 04:29.050
And then by that column being negative it indicates that the other ones will be positive.

04:29.280 --> 04:34.680
So we still have not lost the value of that knowledge by removing that column because the column is

04:34.680 --> 04:35.890
just kind of fodder.

04:35.940 --> 04:37.160
Knowledge is nothing.

04:37.170 --> 04:39.170
It's not bringing anything new.

04:39.180 --> 04:43.910
This coalition which has helped us to really see that there is a strong correlation here and we should

04:43.920 --> 04:44.920
remove it.

04:45.450 --> 04:46.670
So this is the biggest failure.

04:46.770 --> 04:53.290
Of course we can look in the Red Square and we can make some assumptions for example if we look at history

04:53.440 --> 05:00.270
for the very last row in the correlation matrix is very strongly correlated with the purchase call them.

05:00.600 --> 05:04.750
But like I mentioned before the read is not very strong.

05:04.930 --> 05:09.900
So no matter how strong this looks it's not going to be more than point to five.

05:10.380 --> 05:16.350
And the correlation again we cannot really gauge Why is it fair leads to more purchases.

05:16.350 --> 05:19.220
So that is something that can be very informative.

05:19.500 --> 05:25.220
But we never take action on the same thing before CC application being in here in the top.

05:25.280 --> 05:30.750
The application has a lot of different correlations with multiple fields because all of these entire

05:30.750 --> 05:37.620
row of them are going into Iraq is quite strong ish read and that means that the application begin is

05:37.620 --> 05:45.300
related to the policies that we drolls the purchases both in and out of the partner stores as well as

05:45.300 --> 05:49.030
a credit card taking credit card command and so on and so forth.

05:49.620 --> 05:53.510
So this could be a very related field that we would want to give it in the future.

05:53.700 --> 05:57.890
But like I said for a month many times already the correlation for rent is not as strong.

05:57.900 --> 06:00.630
So we can do it now before we finish this year.

06:00.630 --> 06:07.290
There's one more thing I want to point out and that is one full here that doesn't show a correlation

06:07.410 --> 06:12.740
but it is quarterly and that is what user.

06:12.770 --> 06:20.520
Now if you go here to usurp the very middle you're going to realize one thing and you could have realized

06:20.520 --> 06:30.000
this before and that is where the user is only one when both where user and up downloaded are one.

06:30.480 --> 06:31.410
OK.

06:31.440 --> 06:37.110
So this field is a function of these two other fields.

06:37.110 --> 06:43.440
So that may set in not an independent variable because we want independent variables we should not be

06:43.440 --> 06:45.220
using just feel.

06:45.420 --> 06:47.450
So we can get rid of one of them.

06:47.530 --> 06:53.530
Know we're both by the best use for me for my preferences is to just get rid of these feel.

06:54.020 --> 06:57.470
Now this is not something the coalition may choose not to see.

06:57.480 --> 07:02.530
So this is a good point to make that correlation matrix not going to show us all that correlations immediately

07:02.820 --> 07:07.830
but it will sound like we did in the blue case but this is something that you can do by just observing

07:07.830 --> 07:10.230
the data and kind of making your own conclusions.

07:10.290 --> 07:15.950
And that is the point of the point of the it is for you to be sure the data in many different ways and

07:15.960 --> 07:17.700
that start quitting in your mind.

07:17.700 --> 07:23.310
Things can start making sense you start making trends and correlations in your head and then you start

07:23.310 --> 07:25.550
understanding backwards and forwards.

07:25.570 --> 07:28.380
After seen so many blasts of the same data set.

07:28.500 --> 07:33.030
You can feel very familiar with the data you're working with and you can feel very confident of the

07:33.030 --> 07:36.040
result that you're going to bring in when you build your model.

07:36.390 --> 07:38.630
Well we're done with E-D process.

07:38.670 --> 07:45.210
The last thing I want to do is remove these underscore wave underscore call column that we just decided.

07:45.360 --> 07:55.560
So we're going to do so by simply removing this from our dataset with the truckle command column he

07:55.560 --> 08:02.740
calls where user exit.

08:03.120 --> 08:08.670
So we run this and that works and we're finished.

08:08.950 --> 08:10.170
We're completely finished.

08:10.350 --> 08:16.640
So now we're ready to say this dataset on a new set because we just want to reload this new data set

08:16.740 --> 08:21.430
is clean data set whenever we're building the model and we have to run all of these coding.

08:21.780 --> 08:31.020
So if this finalized our idiot process by saving our results to see as be great this is going through

08:31.020 --> 08:35.340
his so we're going to call the new the new church.

08:36.750 --> 08:41.710
And of course every time we say these things that we give out of the index because we don't have.

08:42.330 --> 08:44.030
If you want to keep it that's fine.

08:44.040 --> 08:48.950
But there's only four cases and we say this and we're done.

08:49.500 --> 08:50.430
That is it.

08:50.550 --> 08:53.790
You guys have finalized the EPA process.

08:53.820 --> 08:58.680
I'm very happy to have shown you all of these charts and I know this is a lot of buildup for a model

08:58.680 --> 08:59.580
building process.

08:59.760 --> 09:04.320
But trust me it will make you feel so much more comfortable with all of your work.

09:04.330 --> 09:09.060
It will help you answer a lot of those questions that normally on the meeting in industry will make

09:09.060 --> 09:12.690
you feel like I don't know.

09:12.870 --> 09:16.680
That's definitely something that you want a boy when you're talking to somebody when they ask you what

09:16.680 --> 09:20.230
are the state I mean how does this feel related to these other one.

09:20.250 --> 09:24.930
And if you have no answers you're the data department then there is a problem there and you should fix

09:24.950 --> 09:25.750
it.

09:25.800 --> 09:29.650
So thank you very much for watching and I'll see you in the next video.
