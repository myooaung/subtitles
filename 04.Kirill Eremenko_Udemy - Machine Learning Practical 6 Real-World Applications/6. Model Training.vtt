00:03.680 --> 00:06.860
Hello everyone and welcome to the model training section.

00:06.860 --> 00:07.130
All right.

00:07.130 --> 00:10.040
So just let me recap real quick.

00:10.220 --> 00:14.960
So first of all we know that the data the cancer data and we loaded it we didn't have to clean data

00:14.960 --> 00:15.460
or anything.

00:15.460 --> 00:17.320
Just everything was pretty much ready for us.

00:17.390 --> 00:22.700
We view the head and tail of the data and then we visualize the data afterwards using seaboard and then

00:22.700 --> 00:28.060
what we need to do right now is that we wanted to simply set up the training data set the testing data

00:28.060 --> 00:30.620
set and actually run or take our tomorrow.

00:30.710 --> 00:31.310
OK.

00:31.520 --> 00:32.530
So let's get started.

00:32.750 --> 00:42.980
First step is we wanted to define what are our x values or what's our inputs and I want our y values

00:42.980 --> 00:43.900
which is our upis.

00:43.960 --> 00:44.400
OK.

00:44.750 --> 00:48.300
So first step is we need to define our inputs X simply.

00:48.350 --> 00:53.120
So what we're going to do that we're going to get X equals to simply all the data is contained within

00:53.150 --> 00:55.840
our data frame which is the underscore cancer.

00:55.850 --> 00:58.440
If you got the call that was simply our They're afraid.

00:58.700 --> 01:02.580
So we're going to do here is that we can do the underscore cancer.

01:02.750 --> 01:04.370
That's our data frame.

01:04.370 --> 01:08.880
And what we need to do that we need to includes Yes its empire values we want.

01:08.900 --> 01:11.670
And fortunately we have the target in there.

01:11.690 --> 01:13.360
We have the output included.

01:13.580 --> 01:16.580
And what we need that we not only include the input in that in the x.

01:16.910 --> 01:21.200
So we are going to do that we're going to call the data frame but instead we're actually going to drop

01:21.560 --> 01:25.830
the last sample or drop the target column.

01:25.910 --> 01:29.690
How can we do this we can actually use the method drop to actually drop our

01:32.470 --> 01:37.850
column and in order to do this we can actually and I define This is basically our target that we wanted

01:37.870 --> 01:38.700
to draw.

01:38.790 --> 01:39.350
Okay.

01:39.650 --> 01:43.360
And we need to define at what access we're going to be dropping so we're not dropping the entire column

01:43.510 --> 01:47.570
that's working to find the access one is specifying the column.

01:47.930 --> 01:54.380
Well again let's recap so I'm going we call the data frame we need the entire data fame except the target

01:54.380 --> 01:54.690
value.

01:54.750 --> 01:57.180
Okay that would be our x value.

01:57.460 --> 01:57.860
Okay.

01:57.880 --> 02:01.680
One of you it illustrates the site X and let's run the cell that would tell us.

02:01.680 --> 02:03.910
Okay that's pretty much all are very values.

02:03.920 --> 02:05.350
And if we scroll down in here.

02:05.660 --> 02:07.270
Let's see if we have the target or not.

02:07.280 --> 02:09.530
Actually we don't have the target which is perfect.

02:09.560 --> 02:11.200
That's exactly what we expected.

02:11.270 --> 02:17.400
The next step is that we wanted to define the output or Y which is simply our target column.

02:17.720 --> 02:22.460
So we're going to find y equal to DMF underscore cancer.

02:22.470 --> 02:23.210
All right.

02:23.380 --> 02:30.910
And we're going to do is we are going to simply take the target column and simply that will define our

02:30.900 --> 02:31.400
wise.

02:31.540 --> 02:31.790
Right.

02:31.810 --> 02:38.260
So let's run let's run the cell and then let's review why so simply what we can see here this is simply

02:38.260 --> 02:39.490
our target volumes again.

02:39.500 --> 02:45.230
So the orders are ones because if it's if it's malignant or benign and here we have the 569.

02:45.330 --> 02:45.990
Correct.

02:46.040 --> 02:46.400
Right.

02:46.420 --> 02:52.720
The next step is we wanted to insert a couple of cells and are going to need to do that we wanted to

02:53.260 --> 02:57.240
split our data into training data and testing data.

02:57.310 --> 03:04.360
If you recall that we in order to change our model we're going to do that we use a subset of our data

03:04.420 --> 03:05.460
for training.

03:05.680 --> 03:09.710
And then after the model is trained What are we going to do in order to test the model.

03:09.730 --> 03:14.440
We're going to use the testing data set which is data said that the model hasn't seen ever before.

03:14.610 --> 03:15.280
OK.

03:15.700 --> 03:16.080
OK.

03:16.120 --> 03:24.570
So what we're going to do is we're going to use the skill learn to actually does that for us.

03:24.610 --> 03:32.260
So we're going to do is going to load from killer and we can write model selection or the underscores

03:32.260 --> 03:33.520
selection.

03:33.640 --> 03:36.400
And we're going to we're going to specifically imports.

03:36.630 --> 03:37.470
OK.

03:38.230 --> 03:39.270
Train has split.

03:39.310 --> 03:43.640
Actually if you have that we actually do like an auto complete for use of that we're going to show train

03:44.090 --> 03:50.350
split which is simply the method are going to be using to split split data into testing and training.

03:50.560 --> 03:53.050
Let's run this case successfully.

03:53.110 --> 03:59.160
Next step we're going to do is that we are going to use gene split screen test if we're going to have

03:59.260 --> 04:00.320
that would go to complete.

04:00.430 --> 04:04.620
And if we click shift tab that will tell us okay how can we actually view the data.

04:04.630 --> 04:07.760
How can we how can we call the train to split.

04:07.760 --> 04:12.760
Scroll down you will find that there is an example so you can actually simply just copy and paste this

04:12.760 --> 04:14.980
example pay.

04:15.380 --> 04:18.900
So let's go let's remove this and let's copy and paste.

04:18.920 --> 04:20.790
So here we have extreme access.

04:20.810 --> 04:26.320
Whiting latest Gintas plates and he was specifying the values of x and y.

04:26.640 --> 04:28.710
OK let's move the cell.

04:28.970 --> 04:32.660
And that's pretty much always we have chinked splits we have X we have y.

04:32.660 --> 04:34.150
Here we have the text size.

04:34.190 --> 04:36.990
So what percentage do we need to include that testing data.

04:37.010 --> 04:40.330
So here we generally specify let's say point three values.

04:40.370 --> 04:40.680
OK.

04:40.700 --> 04:42.140
Or maybe point 2.

04:42.350 --> 04:46.430
And you do specify the random state if you like is one of your answers to be to match specifically my

04:46.430 --> 04:47.060
answer.

04:47.180 --> 04:50.090
You have to select kind of a random state that matches mine.

04:50.090 --> 04:58.370
So let's say I'm going to select five for example and the the basically the method going to work and

04:58.370 --> 05:03.230
get injured return back extreme x test Y train and weightiest.

05:03.230 --> 05:03.980
OK.

05:04.310 --> 05:04.650
All right.

05:04.790 --> 05:08.990
Let's run it and let's see what's going to happen so successfully and what we want to do with it actually

05:08.990 --> 05:11.200
when I view what's extraneous.

05:11.570 --> 05:14.260
So foreign exchange actually going to show you.

05:14.420 --> 05:16.590
OK this is the exchange that looks fine.

05:16.760 --> 05:19.160
And here you can see that for $155.

05:19.160 --> 05:25.820
So we actually divided the Empire State cancer dataset into the portion of subsequent of it which is

05:25.820 --> 05:28.670
only 80 percent which is $455.

05:28.680 --> 05:29.390
OK.

05:29.570 --> 05:29.870
All right.

05:29.870 --> 05:34.690
What if I wanted to view let's say Why why train for example.

05:34.760 --> 05:40.130
So we're going to do let's say Why underskirt train that would tell us OK this is why I train and the

05:40.130 --> 05:42.190
values is.

05:42.470 --> 05:43.660
Our basically our targets.

05:43.670 --> 05:44.060
OK.

05:44.060 --> 05:45.470
And the last four hundred fifty five.

05:45.530 --> 05:46.150
OK.

05:46.470 --> 05:52.200
In order to do let's say if one of you let's say X tests.

05:52.570 --> 05:56.880
OK if you want to view that actual testing data so you would see that here we have hundred and fourteen

05:56.880 --> 05:57.770
rows which make sense.

05:57.770 --> 06:01.340
Now we actually divided the dataset into training and testing on it.

06:01.830 --> 06:05.680
OK I think right now we are ready to train our model.

06:05.720 --> 06:07.810
This is simple it's really simple.

06:07.910 --> 06:14.280
The first step we're going to use as Kilbourn we're going to use support machines simply to do the classification.

06:14.280 --> 06:14.940
All right.

06:15.110 --> 06:17.900
So we're going to do is going right from killer.

06:19.010 --> 06:19.510
Right.

06:19.850 --> 06:26.170
And again I don't as V.M. was for for support that machine we're going to import as visi.

06:26.330 --> 06:26.990
OK.

06:27.410 --> 06:29.110
And we're going to do let's run this.

06:29.120 --> 06:36.140
And the next step is that we're going to simply use as well the metrics inside which is kind of classification

06:36.140 --> 06:39.490
report and confusion matrix because we only use it as well moving forward.

06:39.530 --> 06:40.030
OK.

06:40.340 --> 06:50.020
So we're going to do is going to write from scaler dot matrix and goodnight imports and we're going

06:50.030 --> 06:57.290
to import classification report classification underscore report and we're going to import confusion

06:58.370 --> 07:00.030
underscored matrix.

07:00.220 --> 07:02.710
OK let's run it through successfully.

07:02.780 --> 07:07.530
And what we're going to do is Tenshi 8 simply an object out of the as we see.

07:07.620 --> 07:11.830
OK so we're going to do it right let's say you can name it whatever you want.

07:11.900 --> 07:12.430
Just name it.

07:12.450 --> 07:14.170
As VC underscored model.

07:14.420 --> 07:16.720
That's pretty much all our object cannot be using.

07:16.790 --> 07:18.300
I'm going to write as VC.

07:18.520 --> 07:21.790
OK that's basically is Tenshi an object as is this model.

07:22.130 --> 07:26.200
So we're going to do in order to do the perform the training we're going to use the fit method.

07:26.240 --> 07:30.630
On and on the object that we just created to actually train our model.

07:30.740 --> 07:36.850
So you're going to use OK as Visi underscore model which is basically our object that we had here.

07:37.010 --> 07:42.710
We're going to use the fit method and we need to pass simply our input and output data which is simply

07:42.710 --> 07:43.500
aren't any data.

07:43.670 --> 07:48.940
So getting X underscore train and we're going to use y in this country to simply change the data.

07:49.160 --> 07:55.100
If we don't get it done that means the model has been changed and we are good to go.

07:55.100 --> 07:59.560
Obviously we didn't evaluate the model yet and that's all going to be doing in the next section.

07:59.570 --> 08:02.900
I hope you guys enjoy that section and see you in the next section.
