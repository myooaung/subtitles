Hello everybody.

00:02.160 --> 00:03.370
Welcome back.

00:03.370 --> 00:06.210
Today we're going to start with the model building process.

00:06.210 --> 00:10.240
Well we're going to start with the every version of the model building process.

00:10.350 --> 00:13.280
We are going to clean up the dirt a little bit more.

00:13.280 --> 00:18.990
In regards to the one having calling in feature selection in this video we're going to start the one

00:19.000 --> 00:20.740
hiding Cody in the tree display.

00:20.970 --> 00:23.630
So let's start with that.

00:23.880 --> 00:30.730
We begin by of course loading the needed libraries hand us around the lake.

00:30.990 --> 00:32.890
I want to run them a little bit.

00:33.150 --> 00:40.590
Then we're going to load which is new turn that C is always around.

00:40.650 --> 00:46.940
Now the first step is to make sure you separate the user identifiers hours later for another user for

00:47.030 --> 00:48.800
any pretty user calculations.

00:48.820 --> 00:53.200
But what you say at the very end too much depredations the users that they keep.

00:53.520 --> 01:03.020
So they say we're going to do this by setting up a search identifier as they assess that user because

01:03.030 --> 01:06.050
that's a cop.

01:06.420 --> 01:07.710
Great.

01:07.780 --> 01:16.750
Now we need to remove this from the SS so we can get rid of it by say they say that they said that draw

01:16.750 --> 01:22.240
of course columns and you should call them.

01:22.920 --> 01:24.890
Yes.

01:25.810 --> 01:33.300
Now that's the one hiding coding part will do so by looking at our categorical variables and see how

01:33.300 --> 01:34.020
they look.

01:34.220 --> 01:41.070
Now the purpose of one high encoding is so that we can convert all variables into their own independent

01:41.160 --> 01:48.520
binary onze piking models cannot read categorical aerials as they cannot read SRI's us.

01:48.650 --> 01:55.140
We have the independent variable but of course by becomes which is what commercial we're going to be.

01:55.330 --> 02:07.120
So let's be in the poll data that housing value counts which is giving us the value counts for each

02:07.120 --> 02:08.260
of those levels housing.

02:08.350 --> 02:11.010
You can see that we have seen this before.

02:11.440 --> 02:16.110
Now there's a couple of categorical variables that we don't have to start them all because that has

02:16.110 --> 02:18.770
been done in the EPA PARNABY years.

02:18.810 --> 02:26.520
So going into this you see that those that get that do is one hand-coding for for us.

02:26.520 --> 02:32.490
We're told the arguments he takes which ones are cutting are variables and makes them into their own

02:32.490 --> 02:33.690
by Nikon's.

02:33.720 --> 02:45.580
So let's look once the new house and us kids dummys an Army base the original is Burundi's in that's

02:45.580 --> 02:46.280
it.

02:46.440 --> 02:54.650
Now to see what we have that we were gonna use the homes argument and we have the number of homes all

02:54.890 --> 02:56.560
going very well having spread.

02:56.610 --> 03:03.310
So you guys can see here payment type of spread the pain type Mondli semimonthly in songs for simple

03:03.420 --> 03:04.000
soleus.

03:04.080 --> 03:09.990
So I'm sorry for us but that's not it.

03:10.410 --> 03:19.650
We need to a boy and dummy variable track which is causing correlated fields because we are considering

03:19.710 --> 03:23.730
all possible levels in the one hand going towards them.

03:23.760 --> 03:32.130
That means that because a which is housing in the it's going to be one every single time in which both

03:32.790 --> 03:35.860
houses are housing 0 are zero.

03:35.930 --> 03:37.650
That crazy correlation.

03:37.880 --> 03:44.020
So we always have to get rid of one of the 100 homes to make sure there's no correlation no.

03:44.160 --> 03:51.070
And we're going to do so as far as we're going to assess the cost to the originals.

03:51.160 --> 03:54.200
It in dropping a couple of Corley costs.

03:54.240 --> 04:00.890
So we need to replace or drop one for each of the original categorical terms.

04:00.910 --> 04:03.640
So for housing What are we going to give you.

04:03.720 --> 04:12.420
Well let's get rid of all housing any just because it is the original value and it's not very many Except

04:12.420 --> 04:14.700
that this is undisclosed.

04:14.940 --> 04:15.880
What else should we be aware of.

04:15.900 --> 04:23.450
Well what about so we can just as easily find but there is also an AIDS.

04:23.640 --> 04:30.370
So what we're going to do is do the same as housie figurehead of the zodiac.

04:31.570 --> 04:40.200
Now luckily for us there's also any version of payment and there evil this is going to accomplish the

04:40.200 --> 04:44.520
act of removing the correlation from the one hand cops.

04:44.540 --> 04:51.500
Now this trial runs one more day here this week for Ixion and action.

04:52.140 --> 04:54.700
So we have done the one going pretty quickly.

04:54.780 --> 04:59.090
Now let's jump in the train display part of this process.

05:00.040 --> 05:06.340
20 split of course as you may remember we just import the province which is from Eskil learn model selection

05:07.280 --> 05:11.110
import trying to split exit.

05:11.220 --> 05:18.960
Now this is going to return for items which is the case for testing and train sets and the why again

05:19.270 --> 05:28.180
for a train in this excerpt and we get this from running the train display the following is the first

05:28.180 --> 05:34.480
one is the you know the ascent minus the response variable because we only want the exit here again

05:34.490 --> 05:35.910
the independent mirrors.

05:36.010 --> 05:38.230
So we're going to draw the columns

05:41.210 --> 05:43.090
actually next.

05:43.090 --> 05:51.190
Mary is going to be the y axis meaning the actual chern call soon.

05:51.280 --> 05:55.790
Next is the test sites telling us how big that test is going to be.

05:55.960 --> 06:01.870
In this case zero point do it mean that 20 percent is going to go into a test size and is going to go

06:01.870 --> 06:03.110
into trains.

06:03.730 --> 06:10.080
And finally just for me I will use random state zero so I can replicate these results when around 1.

06:10.090 --> 06:12.750
So let's find this and see what we get.

06:12.930 --> 06:19.530
Actually you run perfectly and now we have all four data sets that we want to proceed.

06:19.930 --> 06:21.110
That's it for this medium.

06:21.280 --> 06:22.800
Thank you very much for watching.

06:22.950 --> 06:24.190
And next the.
