Breast cancer the most common cancer among women worldwide accounting for 25 percent of all cancer cases

00:11.330 --> 00:18.660
and affected 2.1 million people in 2015 early diagnosis significantly increases the chances of survival.

00:18.660 --> 00:24.630
The key challenge in cancer detection is how to classify tumors into malignant or benign machine learning

00:24.630 --> 00:28.800
techniques can dramatically improves the accuracy of diagnosis.

00:28.800 --> 00:34.830
Research indicates that most experienced physicians can diagnose cancer with 79 percent accuracy while

00:34.830 --> 00:39.270
91 percent correct diagnosis is achieved using machine learning techniques.

00:39.300 --> 00:45.600
In this case study our task is to classify tumors into malignant or benign tumors using features of

00:45.600 --> 00:47.530
pain from several cell images.

00:47.820 --> 00:51.540
Let's take a look at the cancer diagnosis and classification process.

00:51.540 --> 00:56.350
So the first step in the cancer diagnosis process is to do what we call it final needle aspirate or

00:56.370 --> 01:01.770
if any process which is simply extracting some of the cells out of the tumor.

01:02.130 --> 01:05.610
And at that stage we don't know if that human is malignant or benign.

01:05.820 --> 01:11.370
When you say malignant or benign as you guys can see these are kind of the images of the this would

01:11.370 --> 01:13.820
be benign tumor and this is the malignant tumor.

01:13.920 --> 01:19.650
And when we say benign that means that the tumor is kind of not spreading across the bodies of the patient

01:19.680 --> 01:20.830
is safe somehow.

01:21.060 --> 01:24.660
It's if it's malignant That means it's it's a cancerous.

01:24.680 --> 01:29.020
That means we need to intervene and actually stop the cancer growth.

01:29.180 --> 01:29.580
Right.

01:29.700 --> 01:35.730
And what we do here in the machine learning aspect so now as we extracted all these images and we wanted

01:35.730 --> 01:42.630
to specify if that cancer out of these images is malignant or benign that's the whole idea.

01:42.630 --> 01:47.580
So what we do with that we extract out of these images some features when we see features that mean

01:47.580 --> 01:54.150
some characteristics out of the image such as radius for example the cells such as texture perimeter

01:54.390 --> 01:56.050
area smoothness and so on.

01:56.580 --> 02:02.940
And then we feed all these features into kind of our machine learning model in a way which is kind of

02:02.940 --> 02:03.930
a brain in a way.

02:03.950 --> 02:04.460
OK.

02:04.670 --> 02:07.920
If you guys I'm not familiar with machine learning techniques in general we're going to cover all that

02:08.010 --> 02:09.660
needs from scratch.

02:09.660 --> 02:14.490
But again if you if this is a first kind of a case study or find a first project you've got going to

02:14.490 --> 02:15.680
work on a machine learning.

02:15.750 --> 02:23.860
The idea is we want to teach the machine how to basically classify images or classify data and tell

02:23.870 --> 02:29.040
us OK if it's malignant or benign for example in this case without any human intervention which is going

02:29.040 --> 02:33.330
to change the model once the model is trained we're good to go we can use it in practice to classify

02:33.330 --> 02:35.270
new images as we move forward.

02:35.270 --> 02:35.790
All right.

02:35.880 --> 02:39.730
And that's kind of the overall procedure or the cancer diagnosis procedure.

02:39.810 --> 02:41.750
And by that we conclude the business case.

02:41.790 --> 02:44.680
And now let's shift into some of the machine learning terms.

02:44.760 --> 02:47.850
I hope you guys enjoyed that section and see you in the next section.
