You guys won't come back to machine learning practical this is zero.

00:07.110 --> 00:12.750
And I hope you're enjoying this trial so far in this video we're going on a walk through Africa.

00:12.810 --> 00:14.100
Let's get started.

00:14.100 --> 00:16.320
Hopefully you will get to see a few cool things.

00:16.470 --> 00:21.280
And while we're on this walk I also wanted to take this opportunity to give you a heads up.

00:21.540 --> 00:22.680
Very soon.

00:22.680 --> 00:25.650
You do me is going to ask you to leave Earth view for this course.

00:25.650 --> 00:30.030
Now I know it can be difficult to judge the quality and value of a course this early on.

00:30.030 --> 00:35.580
However the review system simply has changed and they are going to ask to leave reviews earlier and

00:35.580 --> 00:37.360
earlier on in the course.

00:37.440 --> 00:41.490
Now with that in mind we're not going to ask you to leave a five sort of view for this course but what

00:41.490 --> 00:45.150
I would like to ask is please scroll through the tutorials.

00:45.150 --> 00:50.360
If you're not familiar with the contents of the course yes well enough to read a firestorm of course

00:50.370 --> 00:55.650
and please crawl for tutorials and please have a look at all of the different topics I will cover at

00:55.650 --> 01:00.660
the different case studies of machine learning that you will have you'll have different in different

01:00.660 --> 01:05.820
industries different application different different algorithms and hopefully that will give you the

01:05.820 --> 01:08.550
confidence to rate this course a five star course.

01:08.550 --> 01:13.590
If on the other hand you feel that something is wrong with the course if you're unsatisfied about something

01:13.920 --> 01:16.730
then please do let us know before you rate this course.

01:16.950 --> 01:22.020
You can contact the Supernews and support team directly or you can leave us a quick message in the course

01:22.020 --> 01:22.840
Q&amp;A.

01:23.220 --> 01:28.920
We really value your feedback and we will get back to you or we will fix whatever the issue is and then

01:28.920 --> 01:34.190
get back to you and hopefully that will give you the confidence to rate this course.

01:34.250 --> 01:36.380
A five star course.

01:36.390 --> 01:41.090
Now with that in mind if if something is wrong with the course then please let us know.

01:41.380 --> 01:48.070
But if on the other hand you feel satisfied of course.

01:48.210 --> 01:54.300
If you feel satisfied of the course if you're enjoying the tutorials so far and you're looking forward

01:54.300 --> 02:00.300
to look at the rest of the trolls and applying machine learning and practical applications and you feel

02:00.300 --> 02:05.790
that this is a five star course then please do rate it appropriately so other people will know that

02:05.790 --> 02:11.580
this is a farce or a course on machine learning practical applications and that they can confidently

02:11.580 --> 02:13.670
learn that from here too.

02:13.680 --> 02:18.180
Thanks so much guys for being part of a machine learning practical super about this course.

02:18.210 --> 02:23.200
Super excited about the different industry applications that you will have that are coming up for you

02:23.540 --> 02:29.850
and we can't wait for you to take this to trial and until next time happy analyzing and enjoy machine

02:29.850 --> 02:33.010
learning and by the way I enjoyed this book through Africa.

02:33.010 --> 02:33.530
On that note.

02:33.530 --> 02:34.540
See you guys.
