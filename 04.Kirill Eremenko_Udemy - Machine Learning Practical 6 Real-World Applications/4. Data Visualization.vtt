00:05.110 --> 00:13.540
We're going to launch the terminal and go into the directory where we loaded our CSB file We're going

00:13.540 --> 00:22.990
to just check that the file list to launch the download and that will open our explorer and we're going

00:22.990 --> 00:27.430
to see this GSB file once more once.

00:27.670 --> 00:30.900
We're going to create a new why don't we know

00:35.060 --> 00:35.740
great.

00:35.800 --> 00:38.450
We're ready to start working.

00:38.470 --> 00:46.060
We're going to start by loading the necessary libraries that span does not by uncourteous and we will

00:46.060 --> 00:52.350
also set a random seed because we don't want anything random affecting our salt.

00:52.390 --> 00:53.650
So let's start

01:17.180 --> 01:23.560
and we execute our first line of code it's great.

01:23.570 --> 01:24.360
Arifin OK.

01:24.440 --> 01:28.670
This is just a warning some don't pay attention to it.

01:28.670 --> 01:31.760
Next thing we're going to load this VSB file.

01:31.910 --> 01:39.730
We've previously downloaded that in the same directory so we can just use that fundus library to read

01:39.730 --> 01:40.510
that.

01:41.030 --> 01:45.790
We're going to be using that CSB function from pondus

01:48.720 --> 01:57.390
just put the file name and that's ready that's convenient by exploring our data.

01:57.630 --> 02:03.210
We just leave smart phones to remember what we are doing.

02:03.740 --> 02:05.150
We can do that.

02:05.460 --> 02:09.950
Yes just like this.

02:09.990 --> 02:13.900
Let's start by looking the first votes are forward that that's set

02:17.710 --> 02:18.620
right.

02:19.770 --> 02:26.570
So we have a time that we can see that it is increasing and we cover a lot of columns.

02:26.580 --> 02:33.460
We have a total of 28 columns with just numbers that we don't know what they are.

02:33.480 --> 02:36.970
This is because our data set has been anonymize.

02:37.440 --> 02:44.490
We are not allowed to have real credit card transactions so we can't see that credit card bean or what

02:44.490 --> 02:46.470
their credit card was issued.

02:46.480 --> 02:53.820
No they use her IP but that's supposed to be the information that Sindhis columns.

02:53.940 --> 03:01.620
We also see the amount of the transaction on that last label that know if the transaction is non fraudulently

03:01.880 --> 03:05.890
on one if it is.

03:06.010 --> 03:08.610
Great to see you in the next bt you.
