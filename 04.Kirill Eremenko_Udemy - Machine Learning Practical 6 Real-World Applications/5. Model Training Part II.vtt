00:02.530 --> 00:05.900
So let's take a look at what we mean by feature detector.

00:06.000 --> 00:12.730
Ok it's very interesting strategy a very interesting technique and convolutions in general are really

00:12.730 --> 00:15.070
interesting going to show you exactly what they mean by that.

00:15.130 --> 00:17.920
The first step is convolution simply.

00:18.010 --> 00:18.580
OK.

00:18.610 --> 00:25.050
Use kind of a kernel matrix to scan and give an image and apply filters to paint a certain effect.

00:25.090 --> 00:32.710
So simply we can apply kind of a matrix in here that kind of a scan through the image and tell us OK

00:32.770 --> 00:38.160
these are kind of the features within the image can do what we call it feature extraction out of it.

00:38.380 --> 00:40.440
So how can we what do you mean by this.

00:40.450 --> 00:45.130
So in a very simple form we can run what we call feature detectors.

00:45.130 --> 00:48.840
OK let's just assume that we only have one feature of the doctor through the image.

00:49.000 --> 00:52.200
And what we're going to do that we're going to create we'll call it feature maps.

00:52.270 --> 00:55.090
Right which is kind of a kind of a feature.

00:55.160 --> 00:58.170
OK that's kind of a boiled down features out of this image.

00:58.320 --> 00:58.960
OK.

00:59.800 --> 01:00.850
So what do we mean.

01:00.880 --> 01:05.230
So let's assume that we have our image and we want to for example do let's say blurring of the image

01:05.310 --> 01:10.080
so that we could do that we can scan all these pixels let's say average them per se.

01:10.150 --> 01:10.750
OK.

01:10.900 --> 01:17.180
So that will kind of generate kind of a different kind of another matrix or another image is all colored

01:17.200 --> 01:18.160
feature maps.

01:18.160 --> 01:22.870
OK I want you to get familiar with terminologies because once we move a little bit into the actual coding

01:22.870 --> 01:27.200
and training it will be very important to understand what they mean by a kernel or a feature detector

01:27.670 --> 01:29.380
and then WM-I feature maps.

01:29.430 --> 01:35.660
So simply picture maps are the output of the process of running a feature detector on an actual image.

01:36.780 --> 01:37.560
Right.

01:37.590 --> 01:41.640
So let's take a look at in kind of a feature detection in action.

01:41.970 --> 01:46.830
So as you can see here this is my image OK which is kind of you know let's say the boot image as you

01:46.980 --> 01:47.850
can see here.

01:47.970 --> 01:50.200
And again this image is a kind of like greyscale.

01:50.430 --> 01:52.230
OK.

01:52.490 --> 01:55.420
And what we're going to do they're going to apply a feature detector.

01:55.700 --> 01:56.220
OK.

01:56.250 --> 02:01.710
Which is this blue kind of feature detector again it's kind of a matrix again and apply to our image

02:01.980 --> 02:06.900
and then we can open all the colored feature map which is the output of the convolution process.

02:06.900 --> 02:08.340
So let's get started.

02:08.460 --> 02:15.570
First that is OK we can apply let's say the 360 with the matrix here and see see what you just put them

02:15.900 --> 02:16.720
together OK.

02:16.850 --> 02:23.010
What are you going to do is going to multiply each pixel by each pixel and then sum up this pixel by

02:23.010 --> 02:30.210
this multiply again 0 by 1 and then multiply 0 by 1 then multiply 0 by 1 and so on so forth add them

02:30.210 --> 02:31.100
up together.

02:31.150 --> 02:36.180
Just come up with one number and that number will be our kind of value that we're going to be putting

02:36.180 --> 02:36.860
here.

02:37.110 --> 02:42.450
So if we apply the feature detector to our greyscale image we are actually going to get the value of

02:42.450 --> 02:42.960
one.

02:42.960 --> 02:43.530
Why.

02:43.680 --> 02:46.450
Because if you guys can see this is the only matching element right.

02:46.490 --> 02:50.970
Any zero Obviously if multiplied by any value going to be 0 this is the only value that's matching we're

02:50.970 --> 02:51.560
a good match.

02:51.580 --> 02:54.840
If you some them up that would generate that number.

02:55.310 --> 02:55.980
OK what's next.

02:55.980 --> 02:56.610
What do you expect.

02:56.610 --> 02:59.350
Obviously we're just going to take the feature detectors.

02:59.370 --> 03:00.880
We're going to shift it a little bit.

03:00.900 --> 03:01.610
Right.

03:02.010 --> 03:03.260
Let's move forward.

03:03.360 --> 03:06.520
We're going to shift it to the right when we shift it right by one step.

03:06.540 --> 03:11.040
That means we're going to move by one we'll call it stride which is how many pixels we're going to be

03:11.040 --> 03:13.140
shifting through the image.

03:13.170 --> 03:17.520
So if we apply this again we're going to generate one that's shifted again.

03:17.910 --> 03:22.160
We're going to generate again one if we move the feature detector.

03:22.280 --> 03:22.890
OK.

03:22.920 --> 03:25.430
You'll see that here we generated the value of three.

03:25.500 --> 03:25.790
OK.

03:25.830 --> 03:26.550
Why.

03:26.550 --> 03:29.600
Because when we multiply again one by one that's generate one.

03:29.610 --> 03:30.480
These are zeroes.

03:30.660 --> 03:33.820
And then here we multiply one by zero which is zero.

03:33.840 --> 03:36.150
One by one that's again the second one.

03:36.210 --> 03:41.390
That means 2 and then 0 0 then the other one sample one.

03:41.560 --> 03:44.090
And some of them up together that would generate the value of three.

03:44.100 --> 03:46.030
And that's why we got the value of three here.

03:46.050 --> 03:48.270
Let's keep up let's keep moving.

03:48.330 --> 03:50.050
That will fill up the entire matrix.

03:50.220 --> 03:52.680
And this is basically what we call the feature map.

03:52.680 --> 03:57.170
Again it's very simple process very simple technique and that's how we apply kind of convolution.

03:57.390 --> 04:00.630
Here we can choose whatever filter we want we can choose.

04:00.630 --> 04:05.880
You know all the Instagram feature all the Instagram filter is it's simply this kind of bunch of conclusions

04:06.330 --> 04:11.990
that we can run a feature detector or run like kind of a kernel on an image.

04:12.060 --> 04:14.770
OK to come up with a newer image.

04:14.790 --> 04:21.090
This might be blurry blurred might be sharp and might be whatever image we would would them.

04:21.120 --> 04:21.800
OK.

04:22.200 --> 04:22.570
All right.

04:22.620 --> 04:24.930
That's how you kind of perform convolution.

04:24.930 --> 04:27.380
Let's take a look at kind of a convolution in action.

04:27.380 --> 04:28.130
All right.

04:28.390 --> 04:32.500
If you guys go here then this link OK actually a very interesting website.

04:32.790 --> 04:34.920
If you guys can see here this kind of again our image.

04:34.950 --> 04:37.990
And here this image actually presented by certain numbers.

04:37.990 --> 04:43.800
Again if I told you it would represent image as kind of pixels and each pixel had a value from 0 to

04:43.810 --> 04:47.790
255 indicating black and white.

04:47.790 --> 04:49.030
And these are actual values.

04:49.080 --> 04:51.060
You can see you know it's not very clear.

04:51.060 --> 04:54.090
But let's say one hundred and seventy seven 172.

04:54.090 --> 04:57.940
And as you move here it will show you what's the pixel looks like an actual image.

04:58.770 --> 05:05.130
So if I wanted for example to select any whatever kernel we want if we want let's say to can select

05:05.130 --> 05:11.560
like 30 kernel OK or let's say select for example or sharpening one.

05:11.580 --> 05:12.270
OK.

05:12.300 --> 05:16.020
You can actually show that sharpening a can or an action.

05:16.020 --> 05:22.110
So I can see we we we chose three by the kernel and this kind of the kernel we see we saw here this

05:22.110 --> 05:23.200
is three by three.

05:23.370 --> 05:23.940
All right.

05:24.150 --> 05:29.700
And what you could see is we simply multiply the values of the pixels which is in this case 200 and

05:29.720 --> 05:33.420
0 6 multiplied by zero which the value of the kernel.

05:33.420 --> 05:39.030
So it would simply multiply and want to move the mouse because every time we move it actually I can't

05:39.300 --> 05:39.600
explain.

05:39.600 --> 05:45.690
So multiply 206 by zero and then multiply 206 which is the value of the pixel by minus 1 which is the

05:45.690 --> 05:48.000
value of the filter and the first row.

05:48.240 --> 05:50.990
And we keep doing this as we move forward.

05:51.150 --> 05:51.740
OK.

05:51.960 --> 05:56.880
And we just come up with one value with 64 and that will be the outcome of the pixel that we're going

05:56.880 --> 05:59.720
to be placed here and the output image.

05:59.790 --> 06:00.340
OK.

06:00.480 --> 06:03.000
And if we keep doing this it's actually very interesting.

06:03.000 --> 06:05.680
They can actually show this in action.

06:05.760 --> 06:08.360
It can show you how can we do convolution action.

06:08.580 --> 06:12.990
OK and that would be the output image was kind of sharpened image out of our original image.

06:13.000 --> 06:13.450
OK.

06:13.810 --> 06:16.170
OK let's do blurry let's blurred the image.

06:16.290 --> 06:20.560
So if we blurred the image you guys can see it's kind of we're doing kind of an averaging to the pixels

06:20.670 --> 06:25.790
just whatever's here come up with a value we averaged it and that's how we come up with this output

06:25.860 --> 06:26.750
image.

06:26.960 --> 06:31.030
It's very interesting as you guys to go and explore a little bit more.

06:31.050 --> 06:33.180
You can try different kernel's in here.

06:33.570 --> 06:35.850
That's the whole idea of applying convolutions.

06:36.320 --> 06:41.110
This go back to our presentation.

06:41.110 --> 06:42.900
All right.

06:43.540 --> 06:50.000
So as you guys can see this is kind of a quick summary of our feature detection in the next section.

06:50.100 --> 06:56.100
I'm going to walk you through a little bit more of how can we you do pooling or Max pooling and how

06:56.100 --> 06:57.150
we do flattening.

06:57.150 --> 07:00.000
I hope you guys enjoy that section and see you in the next section.
