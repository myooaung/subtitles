Hello everybody and welcome to this business case.

00:09.630 --> 00:11.400
My name is do you say you.

00:11.490 --> 00:15.690
I am an engineer and an MBA with a focus on technology.

00:15.720 --> 00:21.470
I currently teach and work with my own software development startup.

00:21.540 --> 00:27.090
Before this I used to work on payments processing company for e-commerce stores.

00:27.200 --> 00:30.880
And today we're going to talk about credit card fraud detection.

00:31.020 --> 00:37.080
We're going to use both machine learning techniques to try to solve the problem.

00:37.380 --> 00:43.200
For that the action is really important to any e-commerce store and companies put a lot of money into

00:43.200 --> 00:44.150
prevention.

00:44.240 --> 00:47.800
So single fraud can cost them a lot of money as well.

00:47.870 --> 00:52.450
And today we're going to see how aiight is trying to help solve this problem.

00:55.310 --> 00:58.320
E-commerce has really changed everything.

00:58.340 --> 01:01.550
It would be unthinkable not to solve for the Internet.

01:01.700 --> 01:04.340
It gives us the chance to increase our sales.

01:04.430 --> 01:08.930
But we are exposed to hackers and different sorts of fraud.

01:09.200 --> 01:16.060
For this exercise we're supposed to do our own e-commerce store that sells books.

01:16.100 --> 01:22.470
We're still not Amazon but we have sold thousands of books during the last years.

01:22.550 --> 01:28.820
And today we're going to use our transaction history to build a fraud auction system.

01:28.980 --> 01:36.800
We use a publicly available data set for these with real credit card transactions that have been anonymized.

01:36.950 --> 01:44.900
One of the biggest problems of credit card fraud that action is that anyone can still get 15 or 16 digits

01:44.990 --> 01:50.800
of a credit card with a security code an expiration date so far.

01:50.800 --> 01:57.790
Our store has only use rules based systems to do from that direction but we have seen that this is not

01:57.790 --> 01:59.080
enough.

01:59.080 --> 02:01.260
Rules can be as simple as.

02:01.270 --> 02:04.550
Is this the first purchase ever from this user.

02:04.600 --> 02:11.230
So worth $500 or more complex ones such as DA B is from China.

02:11.230 --> 02:19.510
The credit card was issued in the U.S. and they use our solders in the U.K. It will be our job to tell

02:19.510 --> 02:25.960
about those transactions that come from our users the people who actually own the credit card that is

02:25.960 --> 02:33.040
being used to buy the goods that you are selling from those who have stolen credit card.

02:33.140 --> 02:40.160
One of the biggest issues with this problem is that the vast majority of users will not be fraudulent.

02:40.160 --> 02:46.400
This will make it harder for us to detect the underlying patterns in the information available.

02:46.400 --> 02:50.070
This will cause our data set to be highly unbalanced.

02:50.240 --> 02:55.160
So we need to apply different sampling techniques and use different metrics.

02:55.210 --> 03:00.570
Aside 99 percent accuracy one being that our solution is any good.

03:00.740 --> 03:08.260
It is estimated that only point 1 percent of online credit card transactions are fraudulent.

03:08.360 --> 03:14.120
But given the volume of transactions that occur every day that means a lot of money.

03:14.120 --> 03:20.600
The estimated cost of fraud in the U.S. last year alone is over nine billion dollars.

03:20.600 --> 03:23.520
And this number is increasing year over year.
