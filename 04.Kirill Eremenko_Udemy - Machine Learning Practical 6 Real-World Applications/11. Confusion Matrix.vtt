00:00.810 --> 00:05.900
We really want to know how our confusion matrix is behaving.

00:05.970 --> 00:13.290
So we're going to just use the standard gold for that.

00:13.420 --> 00:19.530
We're going to just use the psyche to learn gold available.

00:21.540 --> 00:30.180
We can just copy and paste this function plot confusion matrix in the psyche.

00:30.620 --> 00:31.550
What page.

00:31.570 --> 00:31.920
OK

00:35.590 --> 00:42.020
well mission d by Matlab leave pipeful out Library.

00:42.080 --> 00:54.440
We're going to just copy the missing imports.

00:54.530 --> 00:56.720
We actually already have that one.

00:56.730 --> 00:58.810
So that's not neither.

00:58.880 --> 01:05.060
We have now defined our function to plot the Confucian matrix will now use it.

01:05.060 --> 01:08.750
We're going to now plot our confusion matrix.

01:08.750 --> 01:16.720
First we need to get the predictions for our next test in.

01:16.800 --> 01:17.330
OK.

01:17.450 --> 01:21.410
And we're going to use the product method applied to the model.

01:21.410 --> 01:32.840
We're just trying for that we'll also need to transform our Y test buyable into a pun that data friends.

01:32.840 --> 01:37.530
OK that's dinted input for our confusion matrix.

01:37.550 --> 01:46.540
Now we're going to create the confusion matrix.

01:46.730 --> 01:48.360
We're going to fast.

01:48.610 --> 01:53.630
Why test the expected output the predictions.

01:53.630 --> 01:58.670
We just we're to run those.

01:58.810 --> 01:59.850
Right.

01:59.970 --> 02:04.440
So we're going to just print the confusion matrix.

02:04.740 --> 02:07.560
But that's not really too nice.

02:07.560 --> 02:11.440
We're going to try to see what this actually means.

02:11.520 --> 02:12.120
OK.

02:12.120 --> 02:18.560
So we're going to use deep plot confusion matrix function with just defined.

02:18.750 --> 02:22.680
I think I'm missing an import here.

02:23.540 --> 02:24.700
OK.

02:25.200 --> 02:27.960
So I just run that again.

02:32.190 --> 02:39.780
We're going to use that function we're going to get the confusion matrix.

02:39.850 --> 02:45.150
We've just defined that the same as here.

02:45.420 --> 02:55.590
We also need to define the classes we're going to just use 0 1 to represent the both kind of transactions

02:55.620 --> 02:57.940
that we have.

02:58.380 --> 03:04.450
So now we're going to show that OK I'm here we keep that confusion matrix

03:07.430 --> 03:16.340
and we can see that almost every non fraudulent transaction we could detect correctly.

03:16.340 --> 03:25.790
We got a lot of their fraudulent transactions but we still missed a lot of the fraudulently on suctions

03:25.820 --> 03:35.500
that we marked us non fraud and that these 36 were verdict that US not non-troll Lent.

03:35.800 --> 03:36.270
OK.

03:36.290 --> 03:38.850
That is the issue here.

03:38.930 --> 03:44.900
But the true label was one meaning distance suctions were fraudulent.

03:44.960 --> 03:54.060
That means that four to six out of almost one hundred and fifty users were able to steal from us.

03:54.270 --> 03:56.190
Let's do one final thing.

03:56.330 --> 04:04.280
Let us plot the same confusion matrix but for our entire Daddles will later on apply different sampling

04:04.280 --> 04:10.650
techniques and we want some objective measures on how our model is performing.

04:10.700 --> 04:17.870
So let us repeat this in gold as before but with different Parminter this time.

04:17.870 --> 04:23.160
Notice that this time we are using the entire experimentor instead of trying.

04:23.240 --> 04:24.370
Or X this

04:29.460 --> 04:34.420
let's transform this way must be for everything into our plan.

04:34.570 --> 04:49.140
That's a frame.

04:49.370 --> 05:10.920
We are also regulating us before our confusion matrix I will apply the same function as before.

05:11.230 --> 05:14.380
So this is exactly the same code as before.

05:14.410 --> 05:17.530
Nothing you just with different parameters

05:23.480 --> 05:29.350
so we come over 100 fraudulent transactions that got an incorrect label.
