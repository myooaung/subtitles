Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06,790 --> 00:00:13,720
In this section we're going to focus on the quick crash course in data visualization so throughout this

3
00:00:13,720 --> 00:00:20,230
course we're gonna be visualizing a lot of our data and we're gonna be performing exploratory data analysis.

4
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:25,090
So what this section is designed to do is really just briefly cover some of the data visualization techniques

5
00:00:25,150 --> 00:00:26,620
using two main libraries.

6
00:00:26,710 --> 00:00:32,110
And that is the map plotted library and the seaborne Library later on the course we'll also be exploring

7
00:00:32,260 --> 00:00:35,480
pandas built in plotting capabilities.

8
00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:40,780
Now keep in mind this section is not a comprehensive overview of either of these libraries.

9
00:00:40,780 --> 00:00:45,820
Instead we're simply going to go over some common syntax calls that you will see throughout the course.

10
00:00:45,880 --> 00:00:50,080
That way when you see them when we're learning about deep learning or machine learning they don't seem

11
00:00:50,080 --> 00:00:53,020
completely new and you're not focused on learning that syntax.

12
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:54,350
Instead you already know it.

13
00:00:54,400 --> 00:00:59,680
Having gone through this section if you are interested in a deeper dive please refer to the official

14
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,750
documentation of these libraries OK.

15
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:07,480
So in this section we're just going to quickly go over map plot libs basic syntax calls some seaborne

16
00:01:07,480 --> 00:01:11,890
examples that we'll be using throughout the course and then we'll perform some visualization exercises

17
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:13,930
and then go over their solutions.

18
00:01:13,930 --> 00:01:15,460
Thanks and I'll see you at the next lecture.
