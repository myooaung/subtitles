00:00:06,050 --> 00:00:07,310
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:07,310 --> 00:00:10,510
It's time to test new skills with a project.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:15,170
So you're going to be building a model that will attempt to predict whether or not someone will pay

4
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:22,960
back their loan based off historical information you have three options for this project either go completely

5
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,550
solo an exercise guide notebook or coat along with the solution lectures.

6
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:30,310
Let's quickly review your three options.

7
00:00:30,310 --> 00:00:35,170
Your first option is to simply read the introduction in the exercise notebook and then proceed if your

8
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:37,310
own methods to build a predictive model.

9
00:00:37,330 --> 00:00:42,990
You may even be able to build a predictive model that actually outperforms our guided solution.

10
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,990
So feel free that if you feel very confident with the material that we've already presented for you

11
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:51,070
to just take your own stab at the project and see what you can come up with.

12
00:00:51,310 --> 00:00:55,390
The second option is to follow along with the exercise guide notebook.

13
00:00:55,390 --> 00:01:00,550
So we've written out a notebook with step by step tasks for you to complete in order to guide you through

14
00:01:00,550 --> 00:01:02,350
building a predictive model.

15
00:01:02,680 --> 00:01:08,440
And then finally the third option is to simply code along with the solutions lecture so you can skip

16
00:01:08,440 --> 00:01:13,300
the next overview lecture and simply treat this project as a large coda long project.

17
00:01:13,300 --> 00:01:17,590
So you can cut along with us as we guide you through our solution video for the project.

18
00:01:17,650 --> 00:01:22,420
Feel free to choose any of these three options depending on how comfortable you felt with the previous

19
00:01:22,420 --> 00:01:24,720
material we've gone over.

20
00:01:24,790 --> 00:01:30,520
Keep in mind this is a very large project and to reflect a realistic situation we actually spend a lot

21
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:35,950
of time performing feature engineering and preparing and analyzing our data for our model.

22
00:01:35,950 --> 00:01:39,170
So let's explore the project guide notebook in the next lecture.

23
00:01:39,250 --> 00:01:39,880
I'll see you there.
