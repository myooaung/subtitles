00:00:05.290 --> 00:00:12.450
Welcome everyone to this section on understanding artificial neural networks a large part of this section

2
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:16.500
of the course is going to focus on the theory behind many of the ideas that we're going to implement

3
00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.330
with code later on.

4
00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.390
So we basically have the first half of the section which is pure theory lectures.

5
00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:26.550
And then the second half where we actually begin implementing these ideas of code.

6
00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:31.080
Let's do a quick review of how we're going to gradually build an understanding of artificial neural

7
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:37.360
networks through some discussion about theory so the first half of this section is really just theory

8
00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:38.280
topics.

9
00:00:38.380 --> 00:00:45.100
We're gonna begin by discussing how we build a simple perceptual on model which essentially is our copy

10
00:00:45.370 --> 00:00:51.430
of biological neuron through mathematics and then we'll connect that to the larger idea of full neural

11
00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:58.030
networks and then we'll discuss a lot of ideas that fall underneath a neural network things like activation

12
00:00:58.030 --> 00:01:04.510
functions cost functions and then this particular section The course focuses on just general feed forward

13
00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.500
networks.

14
00:01:05.500 --> 00:01:09.970
And in order to understand a feed forward network need to understand how it actually learns through

15
00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.470
back propagation.

16
00:01:11.470 --> 00:01:15.130
So the first half of this section is all these theoretical topics.

17
00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:20.500
Once we have a solid understanding of these fundamental ideas behind neural networks we'll be able to

18
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:27.160
move on to the coding topics and we'll begin the coding topics by talking about the caris syntax API

19
00:01:27.430 --> 00:01:33.020
which is the main API now for a tense flow 2.0 or two point X and then once we understand that care

20
00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:38.680
syntax we'll show you how to build artificial neural networks with carrots for different types of supervised

21
00:01:38.680 --> 00:01:42.070
learning tasks such as regression and classification.

22
00:01:42.070 --> 00:01:46.510
So we'll first start off with some basic datasets and then we'll move on to more realistic datasets

23
00:01:46.810 --> 00:01:51.760
and a big part of these lectures is actually going to be exploratory data analysis as well as feature

24
00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:52.900
engineering.

25
00:01:52.900 --> 00:01:57.280
Once you have a good understanding of how to perform regression and classification tasks with the cares

26
00:01:57.340 --> 00:02:04.520
API for tensor flow too then we'll move on to having some exercises for Care's artificial neural networks.

27
00:02:04.630 --> 00:02:09.850
Then once we do that we'll visualize our neural networks and their performance through the tensor board

28
00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:11.890
capabilities.

29
00:02:12.050 --> 00:02:13.680
OK let's get started.

30
00:02:13.770 --> 00:02:14.820
I'll see you at the next lecture.
