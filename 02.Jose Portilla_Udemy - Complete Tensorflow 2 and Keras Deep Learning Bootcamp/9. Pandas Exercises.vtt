00:00:05.230 --> 00:00:06.430
Welcome back everyone.

2
00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:12.100
In this lecture we're gonna go have a quick overview of the panel's exercises for the section the course

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:13.540
in the very next lecture.

4
00:00:13.540 --> 00:00:15.270
We'll walk through the solutions.

5
00:00:15.370 --> 00:00:16.750
Let's take a quick look at the exercise.

6
00:00:16.750 --> 00:00:17.730
Questions.

7
00:00:17.780 --> 00:00:18.120
OK.

8
00:00:18.130 --> 00:00:24.940
Underneath your pen this Crash Course folder if you scroll down you should see 0 7 dash pan this exercises.

9
00:00:25.150 --> 00:00:27.550
The very next notebook 0 8 are the solutions.

10
00:00:27.550 --> 00:00:29.700
So go ahead and click on 0 7 first.

11
00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.930
Open it up.

12
00:00:31.060 --> 00:00:34.000
And here we have some exercises based off of a data set.

13
00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:39.340
So this dataset is from a global financial stability and study so you can check it out.

14
00:00:39.340 --> 00:00:43.150
We have the original source of data as well as the publication that it came from.

15
00:00:43.210 --> 00:00:48.100
And basically this dataset is going to be valuable to those who seek to understand the dynamics of financial

16
00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:51.920
stability within the context of several African countries.

17
00:00:51.940 --> 00:00:58.290
So we also have a bullet point list here of all the column names as well as what they represent.

18
00:00:58.330 --> 00:00:59.710
So you can check that out.

19
00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:05.200
But basically the one thing to note here is that there's many many different possible solutions to all

20
00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.750
these questions as long as you get the same answer that we did then your solution should be totally

21
00:01:09.790 --> 00:01:14.400
ok so what we've done here is we want you to complete tasks below.

22
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.780
So all the tasks are in bold here and we recommend that below each task.

23
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:23.430
We have two cells one that says code here and then an empty one for many of these.

24
00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:27.630
You'll notice that as you continue on you should see the expected results below.

25
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:28.990
This empty cell.

26
00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.140
So go ahead and do not code in this empty cell.

27
00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:37.680
Otherwise when you run your code you overwrite the expected output instead code where it says code here.

28
00:01:37.710 --> 00:01:40.770
That way you can compare your results to the expected results.

29
00:01:41.310 --> 00:01:46.200
So here we just have a series of questions for you to answer things such as in what year that can you

30
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.100
have its first system crises.

31
00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:52.980
So keep in mind for something like this in what year that can you have as four system crises.

32
00:01:52.980 --> 00:01:59.370
You could either manipulate panels enough to get the single value of the correct answer which is in

33
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.790
this case nineteen eighty five or you can simplify it enough so that maybe after sorting your results

34
00:02:05.790 --> 00:02:10.890
in the data frame the very first row here shows you that in nineteen eighty five there was a systemic

35
00:02:10.890 --> 00:02:12.590
crisis equal to one.

36
00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:14.650
So again some of these results here.

37
00:02:14.870 --> 00:02:19.170
It may not look like it's the singular correct answer but it does answer the question if you just take

38
00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:21.470
a look at maybe the first row or something like that.

39
00:02:21.510 --> 00:02:25.510
So keep that in mind technically for example for this question the correct answer is nineteen eighty

40
00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:30.660
five if you want to keep filtering out the state of frame by then grabbing the year of the very first

41
00:02:30.660 --> 00:02:31.320
row here.

42
00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:39.430
That's OK to OK so go ahead and try your best at these various tasks and we'll see you in the next lecture

43
00:02:39.460 --> 00:02:40.660
where we go over the solutions.
