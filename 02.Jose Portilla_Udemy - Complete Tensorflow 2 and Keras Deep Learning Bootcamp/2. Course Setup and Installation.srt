00:00:05,330 --> 00:00:11,080
Hello everyone and welcome to this course installation and setup lecture in this lecture.

2
00:00:11,080 --> 00:00:14,550
We're going to show you the two options for setting yourself up for the course.

3
00:00:14,560 --> 00:00:17,710
The first is Google collab notebooks that are online.

4
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:24,610
And the second is a local installation Google offers a free service called Google collaborator notebooks

5
00:00:24,700 --> 00:00:26,520
or Google collab for short.

6
00:00:26,620 --> 00:00:31,130
They're free from Google and the only thing they require for you to do is to set up your Google account

7
00:00:31,150 --> 00:00:37,120
such as a G.M. and was really nice about this is they also allow you to run on GP for free online as

8
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:37,950
well.

9
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,580
And while no installations are necessary you essentially just log in and the notebooks are ready for

10
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:43,180
you.

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:47,290
The internet is required to you're not gonna be able to run these notebooks offline.

12
00:00:47,290 --> 00:00:52,180
You should also keep in mind that because they're free the free tier does have limited disk and RAM

13
00:00:52,180 --> 00:00:52,990
space.

14
00:00:52,990 --> 00:00:58,310
However for the projects we do in this course there should be enough disk and RAM.

15
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:03,330
The other option is to do a local installation which will also walk through in this lecture.

16
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:07,110
This requires however the installation of python and a few libraries.

17
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,780
Once you install Python through Anaconda and the libraries through a environments text file list that

18
00:01:12,780 --> 00:01:18,360
we provide for you it no longer requires internet access beyond that and there are no memory limits

19
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,190
beyond your local hardware so we're going to first quickly show you how to access Google collab notebooks

20
00:01:24,250 --> 00:01:28,420
online and upload files since that's the faster setup of the two.

21
00:01:28,540 --> 00:01:32,290
Afterwards we'll walk through the entire local installation process.

22
00:01:32,290 --> 00:01:37,000
OK let's start by showing you how to access Google collab notebooks online.

23
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:39,380
I'm going to head over to my browser now.

24
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:43,310
All right here I am in my browser a Google dot com.

25
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:45,730
Notice that I've already logged into my Gmail account.

26
00:01:45,730 --> 00:01:48,000
You can see my little icon of change in the top right.

27
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:51,550
So you need to do is also log in to your G.M. account.

28
00:01:51,580 --> 00:01:53,020
It can work on a free e-mail.

29
00:01:53,290 --> 00:02:01,840
And the next step is to Google Search Google collab notebooks hit enter and the first link you should

30
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:02,880
see is collab.

31
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:04,960
That research does Google dot com.

32
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:09,520
And if you don't see that link go ahead and scroll down until you see it but otherwise you could just

33
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:12,100
manually type this your URL into your browser.

34
00:02:12,280 --> 00:02:17,000
Go ahead and click that link and see if we're already logged into Google the first thing you should

35
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:17,410
see.

36
00:02:17,420 --> 00:02:17,930
You won't see it.

37
00:02:17,930 --> 00:02:23,000
This zoomed in but you'll see this little window open up and it has a couple options for you.

38
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,290
It has the examples tab which has example notebooks for you to follow such as an overview of collaborator

39
00:02:28,340 --> 00:02:30,610
features a markdown guide et cetera.

40
00:02:30,620 --> 00:02:36,290
So these are super useful things on how to access files how to grab data from Google storage such as

41
00:02:36,290 --> 00:02:38,130
your sheets et cetera.

42
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:41,530
Then you have recent notebook so just notebooks that you've already played around with.

43
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:42,650
This may be empty for you.

44
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:45,050
It is your first time using Google collab.

45
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:50,330
You can also access your Google drives if you've uploaded files such as our notebooks so we provide

46
00:02:50,330 --> 00:02:51,980
for you in this course to Google Drive.

47
00:02:51,980 --> 00:02:54,650
You'll be able to instantly access them from Google Drive.

48
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:58,200
There's also GitHub so you can check out Get hub your URLs.

49
00:02:58,280 --> 00:02:59,960
There is no github link for this course.

50
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:06,200
Instead what we do is we provide every everything for you as a zip file so as a supplemental resource

51
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,630
for this lecture all you need to do is just go ahead and download that zip file and then you can unzip

52
00:03:11,630 --> 00:03:16,250
it locally and then upload the notebooks they want to play around with or upload all the notebooks at

53
00:03:16,250 --> 00:03:19,160
once using this upload functionality.

54
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,170
So all you need to do is just choose the files after you've unzipped it are really common mistakes.

55
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,700
I've seen students do as they download our zip file and then they forget to unzip it so they get errors

56
00:03:28,700 --> 00:03:29,320
when they upload.

57
00:03:29,390 --> 00:03:34,710
You should unzip the file and then upload notebooks or data or upload it to your google drive.

58
00:03:34,730 --> 00:03:35,000
OK.

59
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:40,630
So what we'll do here is we'll go ahead and use a new Python 3 notebook so we'll click on this.

60
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:42,400
There's an auto welcome notebook there.

61
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,960
And you'll notice here that we have a new notebook and for you it should be kind of untitled 1 or untitled

62
00:03:47,960 --> 00:03:51,150
2 depending on how many times you've run this.

63
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,910
You can essentially now run code inside these cells.

64
00:03:55,130 --> 00:04:00,140
And while it looks slightly different than base Jupiter which is what I used to film this course in

65
00:04:00,140 --> 00:04:02,960
a local installation it's essentially the exact same thing.

66
00:04:02,960 --> 00:04:09,930
You can type in Python code and then do shift enter and then it will run it will first connect and initialize

67
00:04:09,930 --> 00:04:15,240
the notebook and it will show you how much RAM and disk space you have on the back end.

68
00:04:15,350 --> 00:04:20,930
And depending on your Google account it may be less disk space so I actually pay for an expanded Google

69
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:22,040
account through Google suite.

70
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:24,710
So I have a little more gigabyte space there.

71
00:04:25,250 --> 00:04:29,360
So notice here it says print yellow and I get to see the output directly below.

72
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,860
And what's really nice here is essentially all the libraries we use in this course are already installed

73
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:34,850
here for us.

74
00:04:34,850 --> 00:04:42,530
So I can do something like imports and then for example I can import seaborne as S.A..

75
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,230
That's a visualization library we use later on the course.

76
00:04:45,380 --> 00:04:47,960
And you can see it's actually already installed for you.

77
00:04:47,990 --> 00:04:53,060
So pretty much the most basic and common data science and machine learning packages they're already

78
00:04:53,060 --> 00:04:56,480
installed on Google collab just universally.

79
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:59,500
And if you ever need to install something yourself you can just do.

80
00:04:59,690 --> 00:05:05,480
Exclamation point tip install and then whatever library you need to install and it'll install it for

81
00:05:05,480 --> 00:05:06,040
you.

82
00:05:06,050 --> 00:05:11,300
So the exclamation point is what tells the Google cloud notebook to actually run this as if it was a

83
00:05:11,300 --> 00:05:17,100
command line installation the last thing I want to note here is depending on when you're watching this

84
00:05:17,430 --> 00:05:22,470
Google collab has actually not transitioned into tensor flow to officially yet.

85
00:05:22,530 --> 00:05:27,430
So if you do import sensor flow again this may change for you if you're watching this in the future.

86
00:05:27,630 --> 00:05:32,760
So let's go ahead and importance flow SDF do shift enter here.

87
00:05:32,850 --> 00:05:38,940
Notice that currently the default version of tensor flow will soon switch to tense float too.

88
00:05:38,970 --> 00:05:46,920
So you'll notice right now that if I say check the version of tensor flows that's TFR underscore underscore

89
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:53,010
version underscore underscore and to shift enter currently the default is actually still one point one

90
00:05:53,010 --> 00:05:53,710
five.

91
00:05:53,760 --> 00:05:57,900
But in this course we're focusing on the future which is tensor flow too.

92
00:05:57,930 --> 00:06:01,350
So how do you make sure that Google collab is actually using tensor flow to.

93
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,730
Well if you're watching this in the future and you run importance flow it's tough and you don't see

94
00:06:05,730 --> 00:06:09,010
this output then it's already transition to the tenth floor.

95
00:06:09,050 --> 00:06:10,200
So that's totally fine.

96
00:06:10,200 --> 00:06:14,190
And you can check by running this command right here which is t after underscore underscore version

97
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:19,200
underscore underscore however let's say they still haven't switched the tense floor to and you want

98
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:25,560
to make sure it's using it then all you need to do is say percent sine tensor flow version.

99
00:06:25,620 --> 00:06:32,180
Go ahead and just hit internal autocomplete for you space and type two point X run that.

100
00:06:32,420 --> 00:06:35,340
And what's going to happen is it may say tense flows already loaded.

101
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:37,660
Please restart the runtime to change versions.

102
00:06:37,740 --> 00:06:39,070
So I'll go ahead and do that.

103
00:06:39,150 --> 00:06:42,900
I'll say runtime restart runtime.

104
00:06:42,990 --> 00:06:44,920
Notice I'm restarting the runtime.

105
00:06:44,940 --> 00:06:52,770
I'll hit yes and then what I'm going to do is before I actually import tensor flow I'll run this command.

106
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:56,060
So I'm actually going to first run my prints hello.

107
00:06:56,070 --> 00:07:00,840
So another type prints hello new so we can see that I'm actually doing this.

108
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:08,050
So again I have hello new and then before you importance flow go ahead and type out this percent sign

109
00:07:08,070 --> 00:07:15,510
tensor will underscore version space two point X run that and now when you import tensor flow as TAF

110
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:20,130
you've selected a tense flow to which is what we use in this course.

111
00:07:20,130 --> 00:07:22,840
And so you should be ready to go.

112
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:24,660
So this may take a little longer.

113
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:32,250
But now when I run TFT underscore underscore version underscore underscore I'm at the latest 2.0 version.

114
00:07:32,250 --> 00:07:33,830
OK so that's just a quick note.

115
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:39,870
If you've seen this in the future to go collab online notebooks may have already transitioned to tensor

116
00:07:39,870 --> 00:07:40,290
flow too.

117
00:07:40,290 --> 00:07:41,650
So just keep that in mind.

118
00:07:41,670 --> 00:07:45,990
Now the last thing I want to show you is how to make sure you're using GP you in case you desire that

119
00:07:46,260 --> 00:07:53,220
for more complex models and the way you do that is you simply say edit notebook settings click on notebook

120
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:53,700
settings.

121
00:07:53,700 --> 00:07:57,420
Notice right now the runtime that should be Python 3 is what we use in this course.

122
00:07:57,510 --> 00:08:02,190
And there's the option for hardware acceleration and there's more information here that will take you

123
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:06,200
to this link on et cetera on all the hardware resources.

124
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,860
However all you need to do is select here for a GP for graphical processing in it and you also have

125
00:08:10,860 --> 00:08:15,630
the option to try to access a tip used which are tense flow processing units.

126
00:08:15,630 --> 00:08:18,900
So we have our GP you go ahead and hit save.

127
00:08:19,410 --> 00:08:24,600
And now it will go ahead and connect and it will reinitiate lies and now use GP on the back end.

128
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:30,840
OK so now we're using GP you and we have tons flow and essentially everything's ready to go.

129
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:36,570
Now we're going to do is walk you through a local installation if you're satisfied of using Google collab

130
00:08:36,690 --> 00:08:40,950
online then go ahead and just skip the rest of this installation lecture.

131
00:08:42,030 --> 00:08:47,110
OK let's continue on if a local installation Welcome everyone.

132
00:08:47,250 --> 00:08:52,230
Let's go ahead and get you set up if you're following along a local installation if you'd decided to

133
00:08:52,230 --> 00:08:56,610
just keep the Google collab installation from before you can go ahead and skip the rest of this lecture

134
00:08:56,790 --> 00:09:02,580
just make sure to download the zip file with their notebooks that is included as a supplemental resource

135
00:09:02,670 --> 00:09:07,270
in this lecture and this lecture we're going to do is we'll start off by downloading that zip file.

136
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,900
Then also download and install Anaconda showed you how to create the environment activate the environment

137
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,630
install any required libraries with our simpler requirements that text file and then we'll show you

138
00:09:17,630 --> 00:09:19,850
how open an example Jupiter notebook.

139
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:22,020
OK let's get started.

140
00:09:22,020 --> 00:09:22,260
OK.

141
00:09:22,260 --> 00:09:28,050
So our first step and the local installation as well as just getting the notebooks themselves is as

142
00:09:28,050 --> 00:09:33,570
you're watching this course you should notice that in the course content there's a little resource tab

143
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:39,450
over here on the right that allows you to download both a zip file and a requirement that text file

144
00:09:39,780 --> 00:09:46,740
go ahead and download those two and make sure you remember exactly where you saved both of these files.

145
00:09:46,770 --> 00:09:50,850
We'll need to know their exact location on your computer later on in this course.

146
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:55,590
So I would recommend either just saving directly to your desktop or to download a folder somewhere where

147
00:09:55,650 --> 00:09:58,400
you're 100 percent sure you know their location.

148
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:03,030
Keep in mind you Timmy from time to time changes how you download supplemental resources.

149
00:10:03,090 --> 00:10:06,330
So if you don't see it exactly like this over on the right hand side.

150
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:11,020
Go ahead and check out their support page on downloading supplemental resources because this has been

151
00:10:11,020 --> 00:10:12,550
known to change from time to time.

152
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:15,390
I would recommend that if you don't see it the way I've presented it here.

153
00:10:15,390 --> 00:10:19,770
Go ahead and go to this whole port page and check out the downloading supplemental resources.

154
00:10:19,770 --> 00:10:25,650
OK so we're done with step 1 which is the download that zip file and that that text file and know exactly

155
00:10:25,650 --> 00:10:27,310
where they're located on your computer.

156
00:10:27,330 --> 00:10:31,160
I won't be able to answer the question of where they're located on your computer for you.

157
00:10:31,170 --> 00:10:33,630
Next step is to download Anaconda.

158
00:10:33,630 --> 00:10:40,110
So to download Anaconda I've come to go dot com and go ahead and search for Python Anaconda.

159
00:10:40,110 --> 00:10:42,910
And if you want go ahead and add download hit enter.

160
00:10:42,990 --> 00:10:48,340
And essentially what it should take you to is either Anaconda dot com or Anaconda com distribution.

161
00:10:48,510 --> 00:10:52,650
So click on that that takes you to Anaconda and summer on this page.

162
00:10:52,650 --> 00:10:55,600
Keep in mind this page does change its style from time to time.

163
00:10:55,620 --> 00:10:57,050
There should be a download button.

164
00:10:57,060 --> 00:11:01,200
So even if you're on the home page there should be a download button somewhere here.

165
00:11:01,260 --> 00:11:04,650
Go in and search the page for the download from it's over here on the top right.

166
00:11:04,650 --> 00:11:07,730
That will take you to the distribution page which we're already at.

167
00:11:07,830 --> 00:11:10,020
We'll go ahead and hit download here.

168
00:11:10,140 --> 00:11:15,150
And essentially it's the same thing as scrolling down you'll see that there's instructions for the three

169
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:20,760
versions of Anaconda one for Windows one for Mac OS and then one for Linux where you're going to do

170
00:11:20,910 --> 00:11:23,700
is choose the one that's correct for your operating system.

171
00:11:23,700 --> 00:11:26,340
Keep in mind doesn't by default select your operating system.

172
00:11:26,340 --> 00:11:27,420
So I'm on windows.

173
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,100
I'll make sure to select windows and then we recommend that you download Python 3.

174
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:35,910
In fact that's essentially required for this course free to operate with Python 3.

175
00:11:36,060 --> 00:11:42,060
And go ahead and choose either the 64 bit installer or the 32 bit if you're running a relatively modern

176
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:44,760
computer which would most likely be 64 bit.

177
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:49,080
So go ahead and click on that and that will begin the download process.

178
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:54,430
The other thing I want to mention is if you continue to scroll down there's documentation for installation.

179
00:11:54,450 --> 00:12:00,210
So if you want a written step by step installation guide for any of these operating systems either Mac

180
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:04,560
OS or Linux simply click clear on documentation installation guide.

181
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:06,340
Just click read more.

182
00:12:06,340 --> 00:12:12,630
And that takes you to docs the anaconda dot com slash Anaconda click where it says installation and

183
00:12:12,630 --> 00:12:19,110
then it has full step by step instructions for not just Windows here but also for Mac OS on the graphical

184
00:12:19,110 --> 00:12:21,730
install and for Linux.

185
00:12:21,780 --> 00:12:27,870
So if you're operating on any of these systems you have step by step installation instructions officially

186
00:12:27,930 --> 00:12:30,050
up to date from Anaconda themselves.

187
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:32,190
So I highly recommend they check that out.

188
00:12:32,190 --> 00:12:37,200
Again it's just docks that Anaconda dot com slash Anaconda slash install.

189
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:37,410
OK.

190
00:12:37,410 --> 00:12:40,740
You'll notice that my executable file is done downloading.

191
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:44,430
I'll go ahead and open it up and it will look something like this.

192
00:12:44,430 --> 00:12:46,620
So welcome to Anaconda three 20 19.

193
00:12:46,620 --> 00:12:48,710
Go ahead and click next.

194
00:12:48,780 --> 00:12:51,620
Go ahead and accept the license agreement click.

195
00:12:51,690 --> 00:12:52,670
I agree.

196
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:57,810
And then depending on what permissions you have you can download and install either just for you or

197
00:12:57,810 --> 00:12:58,770
for all users.

198
00:12:58,770 --> 00:13:03,660
However all users requires admin privileges on your computer then click next.

199
00:13:03,990 --> 00:13:07,490
Go ahead and select the location that you want to install it.

200
00:13:07,500 --> 00:13:08,600
I just choose the default.

201
00:13:08,760 --> 00:13:15,420
And then the last thing I want to note here is if you intend to run con the commands at your command

202
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:20,580
line like we do when we set up our environment go ahead and add Anaconda to your path.

203
00:13:20,580 --> 00:13:26,760
I know it says not recommended but I highly recommend they actually do add the path environment because

204
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:29,870
it will allow you to do con the commands directly from your command line.

205
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:31,700
So even though it says not recommended.

206
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:34,380
Go ahead and just select add an icon into my path.

207
00:13:34,740 --> 00:13:40,410
OK then go ahead and click install I've already installed Anaconda so I'll fast forward until this is

208
00:13:40,410 --> 00:13:41,070
done installing.

209
00:13:41,460 --> 00:13:41,710
OK.

210
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:42,850
We're actually almost done.

211
00:13:42,870 --> 00:13:47,830
The last thing to do is to open up our command line prompt create the environment activate the environment

212
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,840
and then install the libraries.

213
00:13:49,840 --> 00:13:54,520
So for the command line prompt after installing Anaconda you should be able to search your computer

214
00:13:54,520 --> 00:13:55,780
for Anaconda prompt.

215
00:13:55,780 --> 00:14:00,570
This is for all operating systems and then be able to use the command line there.

216
00:14:00,700 --> 00:14:05,440
If you're on Windows you should also be able to just type in CMT and you'll see your built in command

217
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:06,070
prompt.

218
00:14:06,070 --> 00:14:09,830
However I do recommend that you use the anaconda prompt for this.

219
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:13,810
I would also recommend that you restart your computer before following the next couple of steps that

220
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,100
we're gonna show here.

221
00:14:15,100 --> 00:14:18,570
So restart your computer and then go ahead and open up the command line prompt.

222
00:14:18,670 --> 00:14:23,890
If you can't find any kind of prompt or CND Marquis and Linux users do have the option of just searching

223
00:14:23,890 --> 00:14:28,390
for a terminal and you'll be able to operate at your command line that way you have those three options

224
00:14:28,780 --> 00:14:31,620
and then we're going to do is show you how to create the environment.

225
00:14:31,660 --> 00:14:36,310
So what I will do is after restarting my computer I'm going to open up my anaconda prompt.

226
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:37,000
Let's get started.

227
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,970
All right so what we're going to do is we're going to search our computer for Anaconda prompt and if

228
00:14:42,970 --> 00:14:47,440
you don't see a pop up go ahead and just open up your regular command line tools such as command prompt

229
00:14:47,770 --> 00:14:53,020
or Mac OS and Linux users can open up terminal but we should see here an icon the prompt I'm going to

230
00:14:53,020 --> 00:14:54,510
go ahead and open it.

231
00:14:54,700 --> 00:14:55,110
All right.

232
00:14:55,150 --> 00:15:00,550
Upon launching Anaconda prompt you actually may see a message complaining something about your environment

233
00:15:00,640 --> 00:15:05,870
or saying something like environment not activated using base environment etc..

234
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,990
You can go ahead and ignore those messages since we're going to be creating our own environment the

235
00:15:10,990 --> 00:15:21,370
way we're going to create environment is by saying Conda space create space dash n space and then you're

236
00:15:21,370 --> 00:15:26,870
going to choose an environment name it should be an environment name that you can easily remember.

237
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:34,840
For example I'll call my environment my T F E envy for my tensor flow environment and then we'll say

238
00:15:34,840 --> 00:15:41,110
space and what I need to do is install this environment with a specific version of Python because the

239
00:15:41,110 --> 00:15:46,720
latest version of tensor flow does not actually support the latest version of Python yet so we'll say

240
00:15:46,810 --> 00:15:50,350
space python is equal to three point seven.

241
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:55,270
Make sure you type this command exactly as shown otherwise you'll get an error.

242
00:15:55,300 --> 00:16:00,790
Go ahead and hit enter and what an icon is going to do for us is it's going to create a virtual environment

243
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,050
upon creating this virtual environment.

244
00:16:03,100 --> 00:16:07,600
It will ask you to install some new packages will go ahead and say Y for yes.

245
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,780
And it's going to install in this case Python three point seven and then it will install any necessary

246
00:16:13,780 --> 00:16:18,600
packages to make sure that's all set up upon finishing creating the environment.

247
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,250
It'll give us the option to activate the environment.

248
00:16:21,330 --> 00:16:24,670
We only need to create the environment one single time.

249
00:16:24,840 --> 00:16:29,970
However for activity in the environment if we ever want to use the environment then we need to activate

250
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:30,050
it.

251
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:39,170
So we activate multiple times but we only need to create one time so I will say Conda activates my T

252
00:16:39,200 --> 00:16:44,470
F E envy and depending on your operating system it may say source activate.

253
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:47,910
So just follow the instructions that are reports back to you here.

254
00:16:47,930 --> 00:16:54,710
So anytime I want to use my environment I'll simply type contour activate my TAF EMV hit enter and you

255
00:16:54,710 --> 00:16:59,570
should notice somewhere parentheses that is reporting back that now you're using this my tensor flow

256
00:16:59,630 --> 00:17:00,610
environment.

257
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:07,610
The next step is to recall where you actually saved the zip file and requirements that text file to

258
00:17:08,300 --> 00:17:09,230
in my case.

259
00:17:09,230 --> 00:17:11,710
I'll go ahead and open them up.

260
00:17:12,350 --> 00:17:15,170
I save them to my downloads folder.

261
00:17:15,290 --> 00:17:21,650
So notice here I'm underneath my downloads folder and I also remember to unzip this t f course notebooks

262
00:17:21,980 --> 00:17:27,570
so that now I have this folder called T of course notebooks and I also have requirements that text.

263
00:17:27,740 --> 00:17:33,680
So make sure that you remember exactly where you saved the zip file and the requirements that text file

264
00:17:33,980 --> 00:17:39,050
and also make sure to unzip the file something to keep in mind especially for Windows users is that

265
00:17:39,050 --> 00:17:44,300
you often have duplicate downloads and duplicate desktop folders especially if you're a one drive user

266
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:48,710
so often your computer will have a desktop for your one drive and a desktop for your local.

267
00:17:48,710 --> 00:17:53,180
So just keep that in mind and triple check that you're in the correct location.

268
00:17:53,330 --> 00:17:59,420
So I'm underneath downloads which is directly underneath if I take a look at this P.C. I can actually

269
00:17:59,420 --> 00:18:06,510
click on one of these ticket properties and they'll give me the full file path which is C users Mossad

270
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:11,600
and then go to downloads so I'm going to change directory one further into downloads so I can be in

271
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:13,910
the same directory as this notebook.

272
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:22,060
So let me close that I'll come back to my anaconda prompt and say See the and in my case I'll go to

273
00:18:22,060 --> 00:18:23,140
downloads.

274
00:18:23,210 --> 00:18:26,060
They should be able to tab autocomplete this.

275
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:28,000
OK so now I'm in my downloads.

276
00:18:28,000 --> 00:18:32,080
The next step is to actually install the required libraries.

277
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:33,460
And there's two steps for this.

278
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:37,220
One is to make sure that we have the PIP installer available to us.

279
00:18:37,220 --> 00:18:44,460
And I can do this by typing out Conda install Pip hit enter and this will make sure that we're using

280
00:18:44,550 --> 00:18:47,750
a pip installer that's connected to this environment.

281
00:18:47,820 --> 00:18:52,840
It may already be installed for us so it may say something like all requested packages already installed.

282
00:18:52,890 --> 00:18:56,340
Once that's done then we simply type out the following command.

283
00:18:56,460 --> 00:19:05,620
We will say pip install space Dash are space requirements not text file and if you're in the same location

284
00:19:05,980 --> 00:19:10,850
as the top text file you should be able to tab autocomplete this then enter.

285
00:19:10,870 --> 00:19:16,990
And what this is going to do for us is going to automatically download the packages from the requirements

286
00:19:17,170 --> 00:19:21,730
text file if you actually open up and take a look at the requirements on text file.

287
00:19:22,060 --> 00:19:27,550
It's actually it's a very simple text file that you can easily edit and make any changes to if necessary.

288
00:19:27,580 --> 00:19:30,390
So I'm going to bring it over just to show you what it looks like.

289
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:34,690
So while this is installing I want to show you that the requirements that text file is just eight lines

290
00:19:35,070 --> 00:19:39,510
where essentially has a library name and then it's required version.

291
00:19:39,550 --> 00:19:43,780
So for instance if you're watching this in the future and you want to update to a feature version of

292
00:19:43,780 --> 00:19:49,060
pandas all you need to do is edit this to whatever version of pandas you want maybe by the time you're

293
00:19:49,060 --> 00:19:54,910
watching this version of pandas point thirty is out to you just say zero point thirty.

294
00:19:55,030 --> 00:19:58,460
Now in my case that's not the change that's been set.

295
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:00,460
So I'll go ahead and not do that change.

296
00:20:00,550 --> 00:20:04,370
So you can edit this requirements out text file however you deem necessary.

297
00:20:04,450 --> 00:20:08,740
But the main thing to know is we're essentially just installing the visualisation libraries psychic

298
00:20:08,770 --> 00:20:14,290
learn and then tensor flow to as well as our own copy of Jupiter which is our main programming environment

299
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:15,580
for this course.

300
00:20:15,610 --> 00:20:21,040
Let's head back to the anaconda prompt now that it's almost done installing all right now that that's

301
00:20:21,040 --> 00:20:21,970
done installing.

302
00:20:21,970 --> 00:20:24,580
The only thing left to do is at your command line.

303
00:20:24,760 --> 00:20:29,640
Go ahead and call Jupiter notebook and hit enter.

304
00:20:29,800 --> 00:20:36,010
And what should happen is you'll see a little output saying Hey we're running the notebook at one of

305
00:20:36,010 --> 00:20:37,340
these local your L's.

306
00:20:37,450 --> 00:20:39,720
So if you want you could manually copy and paste these.

307
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,790
However be careful not to use control seat copy because control C actually stops the server.

308
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:50,590
We should have seen though is your notebook environment would have automatically opened up in your Downloads

309
00:20:50,590 --> 00:20:57,790
folder and after that you're going to do is essentially let me bring it up for you locate here in your

310
00:20:57,790 --> 00:21:00,980
browser your ti of course notebooks.

311
00:21:01,390 --> 00:21:04,570
Go ahead and enter them and you should see the files themselves.

312
00:21:04,570 --> 00:21:08,100
So everything's essentially organized and the order we filmed it in.

313
00:21:08,110 --> 00:21:10,180
So it corresponds to sections of the course.

314
00:21:10,180 --> 00:21:15,040
You click on one of these and I have access to all the notebooks and you can easily create new notebooks

315
00:21:15,070 --> 00:21:23,500
by simply saying new and then select python and I should be able to type import tensor flow as TAF shift

316
00:21:23,560 --> 00:21:24,350
enter.

317
00:21:24,550 --> 00:21:30,550
You've imported TAF and then we can always check the version by saying TAF underscore underscore the

318
00:21:30,850 --> 00:21:35,970
go ahead just tab autocomplete for version hit enter and it should report back to you tensor flight

319
00:21:35,990 --> 00:21:36,800
too.

320
00:21:36,990 --> 00:21:37,800
OK.

321
00:21:37,900 --> 00:21:39,410
That's it for the setup.

322
00:21:39,460 --> 00:21:43,870
Just keep in mind that anytime you want to use the environment you'll need to activate it at the command

323
00:21:43,870 --> 00:21:44,310
line.

324
00:21:44,470 --> 00:21:46,870
You don't need to create it you just need to activate it.

325
00:21:46,900 --> 00:21:48,520
Thanks and we'll see you at the next lecture.
