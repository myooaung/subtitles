00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:05.620
OK.

2
00:00:05.640 --> 00:00:08.290
Here we have the nut pie exercise notebook.

3
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:12.980
The main important note I want to show you here is for some of these questions.

4
00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.240
Make sure you don't run the cells directly above the Example output shown otherwise that ends up writing

5
00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:19.860
over the Example output.

6
00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:24.180
So essentially you just have a bunch of questions like importing them pies MP creating an array of 10

7
00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.740
zeros create an array of 10 ones create an array of ten fives and so on and notice for a lot of these.

8
00:00:29.830 --> 00:00:31.600
There's an example output.

9
00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:37.560
And the reason we have two cells is we want you to code in this cell and not code in this cell that

10
00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:39.540
has the output directly beneath it.

11
00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:43.490
Otherwise if you were to run the cell it would overwrite the output here.

12
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:44.390
So keep that in mind.

13
00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:50.760
And basically it's just a bunch of questions asking you to kind of mimic the output shown as well as

14
00:00:51.090 --> 00:00:53.810
an explanation of what the output being shown is.

15
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:58.290
So just keep going on and you should be able to see the correct answer as well as the task.

16
00:00:58.470 --> 00:01:03.630
And for some of these where there's a random number your results value may be different than the ones

17
00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.120
we show here.

18
00:01:04.140 --> 00:01:08.940
Just because there's random values and we don't ask you to set any specific seed for these couple of

19
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:10.120
first ones.

20
00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:11.370
OK and that's it.

21
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.130
Just go ahead and go along and do your best to answer the questions.

22
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:17.820
We'll see you at the next lecture where we actually go over the solutions.
