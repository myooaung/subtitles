00:00:05.530 --> 00:00:11.860
Hello everyone and welcome to this lecture on downloading image data so far with only dealt with prepackaged

2
00:00:11.860 --> 00:00:15.690
datasets such as the endless dataset and the sofar 10 datasets.

3
00:00:15.850 --> 00:00:19.900
But in real life and in real world problems you're going to be working with quote unquote real image

4
00:00:19.900 --> 00:00:23.410
files like a JPEG file or a png file.

5
00:00:23.410 --> 00:00:28.810
So let's learn about tensor flows built in tools for generating image data patches from directories

6
00:00:28.810 --> 00:00:30.060
with real files.

7
00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:35.560
First in order to do this we need to download a large zip file of data the zip file was too large to

8
00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:36.790
upload to you to me directly.

9
00:00:36.790 --> 00:00:42.820
So we have as a Google Drive link to this data set is available as a zip file called Cell underscore

10
00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:44.320
images dot zip.

11
00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:46.540
The link is a supplemental resource.

12
00:00:46.540 --> 00:00:50.920
In this lecture it is also within the same Google Drive resource as a resource.

13
00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:51.460
As a slide.

14
00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:52.830
So you may have actually already seen it.

15
00:00:53.230 --> 00:00:57.340
So I want to explore getting the data and in this lecture we're just going to walk through where we

16
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.820
can find that data and then downloading it and then getting the file path for it.

17
00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:06.250
So let's go ahead and go to the supplemental resource link.

18
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:11.380
It's a supplemental resource link that is within this lecture or you can visit the link also in the

19
00:01:11.380 --> 00:01:14.700
FAA cue lecture let's head to that link now.

20
00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:15.090
All right.

21
00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.720
So there's two different ways of getting this.

22
00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:21.700
So if you've already explored our slides that correspond with the sections of this course you've probably

23
00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.100
already seen this Google Drive that links to all the slides within this google drive.

24
00:01:26.110 --> 00:01:28.900
You'll notice that there's cell images that zip.

25
00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:31.600
So you can go ahead and click this and download it.

26
00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:37.090
If you used our direct link from the supplemental resource for this lecture then that would have taken

27
00:01:37.090 --> 00:01:39.540
you to a link that looks something like this.

28
00:01:39.580 --> 00:01:42.140
It'll say something like woops there's a problem with the preview.

29
00:01:42.220 --> 00:01:45.670
And that actually makes sense you can't really preview a large zip file.

30
00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:50.450
All you need to do is hit here and click on the download button for this cell.

31
00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:51.880
Images that zip.

32
00:01:51.940 --> 00:01:56.120
OK so let's go ahead and download the cell images dot zip.

33
00:01:56.140 --> 00:02:01.790
I'm going to fast forward until this is done downloading OK so that zip file finished downloading for

34
00:02:01.790 --> 00:02:02.270
me.

35
00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.370
Which you're going to do is locate that zip file on your computer.

36
00:02:06.410 --> 00:02:09.920
Recall that I will be able to know where your download was save on your computer.

37
00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:10.940
You'll have to figure this out.

38
00:02:10.970 --> 00:02:15.350
But typically it's going to be under your Downloads folder and the next thing to do is to figure out

39
00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:17.960
the file path for this zip file.

40
00:02:17.990 --> 00:02:21.350
But first I want to extract the contents of the zip file.

41
00:02:21.410 --> 00:02:27.440
So go ahead and just hit something like extract all both Windows and Mac OS have built in extraction

42
00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:28.750
or unzipping tools.

43
00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:34.850
Go ahead and unzip the file and we'll go ahead and just keep it to this cell images and it will take

44
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.670
some time because there are quite a bit of images in this dataset.

45
00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:40.940
So keep that in mind.

46
00:02:41.060 --> 00:02:46.100
I'm going to fast forward until this is done unzipping the image files.

47
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:46.460
All right.

48
00:02:46.460 --> 00:02:52.640
That has now finished unzipping if you open up these cell images folder and you may see it twice you

49
00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.230
may see cell images cell images depending on how you actually extract it.

50
00:02:56.270 --> 00:02:59.960
We need to do is realize that there's test and train folders.

51
00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:03.890
So what I want you to do is one directory up from test and train.

52
00:03:04.010 --> 00:03:08.730
Just go ahead and grab the properties and then grab the actual location.

53
00:03:08.770 --> 00:03:13.190
So you'll notice for my location it's on there see users downloads cell images.

54
00:03:13.190 --> 00:03:18.770
So what I want to do really is either move this file to somewhere that's convenient for me or understand

55
00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:24.940
the entire file path and then what I want to do is have the next sub folders be test train.

56
00:03:24.980 --> 00:03:25.480
OK.

57
00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:30.710
So go ahead and make sure that you either copy paste that file path I'm going to go ahead and move this

58
00:03:30.710 --> 00:03:33.290
folder to a different location on my computer.

59
00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.240
Once you actually understand where the file path is again you can do that just by checking the properties

60
00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.910
here and checking the location.

61
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.170
Go ahead and open up a Jupiter notebook.

62
00:03:42.170 --> 00:03:44.390
Make sure you've copy that file path.

63
00:03:44.390 --> 00:03:44.620
All right.

64
00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:49.110
Here I am in a new Jupiter notebook to double check that everything is working.

65
00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.460
Simply run the following commands say import os which stands for import operating system commands and

66
00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:02.660
then we're we're going to be able to do is go ahead and copy and paste the file path for that cell images

67
00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.500
folder.

68
00:04:03.500 --> 00:04:08.540
This folder then should have train and test directly under it and depending on how you unzip that you

69
00:04:08.540 --> 00:04:11.720
may need to put cell images twice.

70
00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:14.380
Again that depends on the exact way you unzip it.

71
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:18.790
Either way what we want really is to understand where the cell images folder is.

72
00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:25.890
Go ahead and assign that string as your data directory once you have that.

73
00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:34.250
Go ahead and type OS dot list D I R and then pass in the variable that you just created data directory

74
00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:41.810
run that and you should see test and train strings as output if you're able to run these three commands

75
00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:47.630
then you're good to go for the next lecture if you get any sort of error in running OS that list directory

76
00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:52.060
you need to triple check your file path of where the cell images folder is.

77
00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:58.160
Make sure you've unzipped that folder and that the test and train folders have been fully filled by

78
00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.450
those image files.

79
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:03.830
I won't really be able to help you out here because I won't be able to know where you actually saved

80
00:05:03.950 --> 00:05:06.450
this zip file and unzip it on your computer.

81
00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.080
Only you can know that because you're the one that downloaded it.

82
00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:14.720
So please if you get any error on this list directory line please triple check your file path.

83
00:05:15.170 --> 00:05:20.470
OK so once you're able to list directories test and train you're good to go for the next series of lectures.

84
00:05:20.510 --> 00:05:21.410
Let's get started.

85
00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:21.920
I'll see you there.
