00:00:05,320 --> 00:00:08,030
Welcome back everyone to finish off this section.

2
00:00:08,050 --> 00:00:12,940
We're going to have a couple of exercise questions involving the data visualization skills we just went

3
00:00:12,940 --> 00:00:13,660
over.

4
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:16,720
Let's head over to the notebook and go over the tasks.

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:16,960
All right.

6
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,080
Here I am at the visualization exercise notebook.

7
00:00:20,170 --> 00:00:24,160
And if you check out the data we're gonna be dealing with a classic dataset that basically contains

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,790
the prices and then some other attributes of about 54000 diamonds.

9
00:00:28,810 --> 00:00:30,350
So it's a really great dataset.

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,140
And here's the different columns that are available and inside the exercise notebook.

11
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:38,050
We actually already run the imports and data for you.

12
00:00:38,080 --> 00:00:43,060
So all you need to do is just run these first few cells to actually do your imports and read in the

13
00:00:43,060 --> 00:00:46,620
file so you don't need to worry about finding out where the actual data is.

14
00:00:46,630 --> 00:00:47,500
We set that up for you.

15
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:49,560
Just go ahead and run these first cells.

16
00:00:49,810 --> 00:00:53,000
Then once you've done that we have some tasks for you to complete.

17
00:00:53,020 --> 00:00:59,680
Keep in mind in order not to overwrite the actual expected output visualization you should code in this

18
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,520
cell and not overwrite anything in this cell.

19
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:06,190
So keep that in mind you should only be coding in the cells that say code here.

20
00:01:06,190 --> 00:01:10,870
First we're going to have you create a scatter plot of this price versus carrot as shown below.

21
00:01:10,870 --> 00:01:15,910
And then you'll notice that basically there's an issue with this plot in that the marker edge is making

22
00:01:15,910 --> 00:01:17,500
it hard to actually read this plot.

23
00:01:17,980 --> 00:01:23,050
So then we want you to use the alpha parameter an edge color parameter to deal with that overlapping

24
00:01:23,050 --> 00:01:25,670
issue and get something that looks a little more like this.

25
00:01:25,690 --> 00:01:32,050
Keep in mind there's going to be some task requirements that we didn't specifically go over in the lectures.

26
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,840
A big part of becoming good at using these visualization libraries is being able to do either a quick

27
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:43,450
Google search or search the online documentation or search stack overflow to figure out how to solve

28
00:01:43,510 --> 00:01:44,660
a common task.

29
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:49,900
So keep that in mind you may need to actually google or search around the online documentation to figure

30
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,260
out the parameter calls.

31
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:57,190
However there's pretty heavy hints within the tasks itself next we want you to figure out how to make

32
00:01:57,190 --> 00:02:02,170
that previous plot larger so that it looks something like this then we want you to create a histogram

33
00:02:02,230 --> 00:02:04,720
of the price column as shown below.

34
00:02:04,720 --> 00:02:07,870
Notice there's no kernel density estimation plot on top of this.

35
00:02:07,870 --> 00:02:13,970
It's just the histogram then we want you to create a count plot of the instances per cut type as shown

36
00:02:13,970 --> 00:02:14,710
here.

37
00:02:15,020 --> 00:02:21,470
And then we want you to figure out how to make a box plot of those cut types and then we have kind of

38
00:02:21,470 --> 00:02:26,720
a final challenge which is to see if you can figure out how to change the ordering of the box plot.

39
00:02:27,170 --> 00:02:32,380
So you'll notice here in this ordering on the default box plot it goes ideal premium.

40
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:32,820
Good.

41
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:34,350
Very good and fair.

42
00:02:34,580 --> 00:02:38,920
It would be nicer if we could have this in an order that goes from worst to best.

43
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:39,440
So fair.

44
00:02:39,440 --> 00:02:39,870
Ideal.

45
00:02:39,890 --> 00:02:40,340
Good cup.

46
00:02:40,370 --> 00:02:41,870
Very good and then premium.

47
00:02:41,870 --> 00:02:46,570
So we want you to do is figure out is there an actual parameter call that allow you to order this and

48
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:50,490
you'll notice that we changed up the palette for this box plot as well.

49
00:02:50,650 --> 00:02:51,270
Okay.

50
00:02:51,350 --> 00:02:52,730
So those are all the tasks.

51
00:02:52,730 --> 00:02:54,520
Best of luck and if you get stuck.

52
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,700
Feel free to look at the next lecture or go over the solutions.

53
00:02:57,710 --> 00:02:58,280
I'll see you there.
