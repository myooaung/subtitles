00:00:05,580 --> 00:00:08,580
Welcome everyone to this section on deployment.

2
00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:12,310
Let's start with a quick overview of what this section is going to cover.

3
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:18,000
We're first going to start off in a Jupiter notebook environment or your Google collab environment and

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,630
we'll start off by analyzing the famous IRS data set which predicts a flower class and or using that

5
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:30,120
data sets we can focus more on creating a model and creating a deployment from that model instead of

6
00:00:30,120 --> 00:00:32,450
the actual analysis of the data itself.

7
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:37,410
So we're going to start from scratch loading that data set create a model of that dataset and then we'll

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,780
show you how to export that model as well as export any additional components you need to go along with

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:43,530
that model.

10
00:00:43,530 --> 00:00:49,470
For example if you used scaling in your model which we will use in this particular case we'll show you

11
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:54,960
not only how to export your model but also export your scalar that way when new data comes in to your

12
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:55,950
deployed model.

13
00:00:55,950 --> 00:01:01,620
You can scale that data based off your historical scaling as the model expects and then we'll show you

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:04,440
really two main ways of deploying your model.

15
00:01:04,440 --> 00:01:11,070
One is by creating a COBOL API so we'll call that API with postmen and then will show you how to programmatically

16
00:01:11,070 --> 00:01:16,770
call the API through python and then we'll show you how to call the model through a simple flask web

17
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:23,460
application which is essentially just an extension of the fundamentals we build in the API lectures

18
00:01:23,610 --> 00:01:28,260
and then we'll show you how to launch this full machine learning application to the web so that any

19
00:01:28,260 --> 00:01:34,470
user can visit your web app type in whatever numbers they want and then your web application spits out

20
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:36,930
a prediction based off the save that model.

21
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:38,220
You train in the beginning.

22
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:38,430
All right.

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,920
So lots to cover here.

24
00:01:40,050 --> 00:01:45,700
But first I want to make a couple of notes of what this section is not going to cover please note that

25
00:01:45,700 --> 00:01:48,330
this course is not a web development course.

26
00:01:48,340 --> 00:01:53,770
So if you've never deployed any web application and don't even know maybe what an API is then this section

27
00:01:53,770 --> 00:01:59,380
is probably too advanced for you and you don't have a good use case yet for deploying a model if you're

28
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:04,720
not actually really familiar with the fundamentals of just what deployment means to begin with.

29
00:02:04,750 --> 00:02:10,930
So this section keep in mind is going to assume some basic knowledge of APIs and web apps.

30
00:02:10,930 --> 00:02:15,880
If you don't know what an API is or what a web application is please revisit this section after learning

31
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:21,940
a bit about those topics the entirety of what API is are and what Web applications are there really

32
00:02:21,940 --> 00:02:26,660
outside the scope of this course which focuses on deep learning and tensor flow too.

33
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:32,510
So this course isn't designed to completely supplement an entire web development course.

34
00:02:32,550 --> 00:02:37,800
Also please note that we cannot help you or consult for your homework or personal projects since you

35
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:38,820
wanted deployed to the Web.

36
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:44,730
Please keep in mind that we have far too many students and since each deployment case is fundamentally

37
00:02:44,730 --> 00:02:49,830
unique to your own dataset and your own model we cannot personally consult for each individual student.

38
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:54,180
So if you are deploying your own personal projects and have questions on those please post those questions

39
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:55,890
toward discord chat channel.

40
00:02:55,890 --> 00:03:01,440
Please do not post questions about your own homework projects or your own work project deployments to

41
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:02,500
the Q and A forums.

42
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:04,450
That's not what the CUNY forums is meant for.

43
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,990
Now if that being said the videos and more importantly the code that goes along this section of course

44
00:03:10,260 --> 00:03:16,050
should be more than enough for you to actually use as scaffolding or skeleton code for you to attach

45
00:03:16,050 --> 00:03:18,140
to your own data sets and your own projects.

46
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:22,110
So if you go through a section and really understand the core ideas of this section you should have

47
00:03:22,110 --> 00:03:25,210
no problem expanding this to your own projects.

48
00:03:25,240 --> 00:03:29,100
Okay so with that being said let's get started and I'll see you in the next lecture.
