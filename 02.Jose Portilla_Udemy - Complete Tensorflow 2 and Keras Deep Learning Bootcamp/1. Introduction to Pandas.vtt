Hello everyone and welcome to this section on pandas.

2
00:00:08.410 --> 00:00:14.190
In this lecture we're going to give you a brief introduction on what it's pandas so in this overall

3
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:19.200
section the course we're in discussing this lecture why we use pandas and what it actually is and then

4
00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.790
we'll have a series of lectures that go through the specifics of operating pandas that includes topics

5
00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:28.860
such as pandas series and data frames how to deal with missing data how to perform group by methods

6
00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:34.530
a variety of useful panda operations and then we'll end the section with a set of exercise questions

7
00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:40.960
and then we'll go over the solutions for them so let's begin by discussing quickly what is pandas.

8
00:00:40.960 --> 00:00:43.780
So pandas doesn't actually stand for a panda bear.

9
00:00:43.930 --> 00:00:50.360
It derives its name from panel data and really it's the most popular library for data handling for python.

10
00:00:50.590 --> 00:00:54.340
And it's built directly off of nut pie which is why we covered nut pi first.

11
00:00:54.340 --> 00:01:00.740
In fact you'll see a lot of similarities when using pandas after already learning num pi since we're

12
00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:05.900
going to be working with data continuously in this course we're going to be using pandas to read in

13
00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:10.310
our data clean the data and even perform feature engineering with pandas.

14
00:01:10.340 --> 00:01:14.150
These are things you need to actually perform before even import tensor flow.

15
00:01:14.210 --> 00:01:20.120
So it's a really great library to learn and it's going to be useful across many aspects of a data analysis

16
00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:22.680
procedure now.

17
00:01:22.720 --> 00:01:27.630
Pandas relies on some core data structures for its operations which are going to learn about in the

18
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.250
next series of lectures.

19
00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:36.270
The first one is the actual pandas series and this is essentially a number pi data array with the addition

20
00:01:36.330 --> 00:01:41.460
of a named index and will later on see why that is really useful for real world data.

21
00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.560
Then we'll expand this to the really core structure of PANDAS which is the data frame.

22
00:01:46.770 --> 00:01:53.670
And this is essentially a data matrix that has both labeled indices or a labeled index and labeled columns.

23
00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:57.370
So we're gonna be exploring these throughout the section of the course.

24
00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:02.130
Now if you're interested in topics such as tensor flow for deep learning that you've probably already

25
00:02:02.130 --> 00:02:04.800
encountered pandas to some degree.

26
00:02:04.800 --> 00:02:08.940
So the question arises What if you already know some pandas are you ready to continue on to the next

27
00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:09.270
section.

28
00:02:09.270 --> 00:02:14.280
Of course what I would encourage you to do is check out the exercise at the end of the section test

29
00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:19.110
your abilities and then feel free to browse through various pandas topic lectures to review anything

30
00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:24.060
you may have forgotten or need to brush up on now before we continue on.

31
00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.520
I would actually highly recommend you check out the fantastic documentation at pandas not pi data the

32
00:02:29.550 --> 00:02:32.420
org slash pandas dash docs slash stable.

33
00:02:32.550 --> 00:02:37.650
In fact let's quickly explore it because I think pandas has some of the best online documentation for

34
00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.330
any python library.

35
00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:39.630
All right.

36
00:02:39.630 --> 00:02:44.910
So here I am at the official documentation for pandas and this is a resource that I highly recommend

37
00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.580
that you check out throughout this section of the course and throughout the general course.

38
00:02:49.620 --> 00:02:53.940
In fact there's a really great getting started section here that you can click on.

39
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.220
And it has this really nice ten minute guide to pandas.

40
00:02:56.220 --> 00:02:59.880
Keep in mind we will be going over a lot of this but this is a really nice guide.

41
00:02:59.880 --> 00:03:04.500
In case you maybe forgot how to deal with missing data you can just click on it here and quickly review

42
00:03:04.530 --> 00:03:09.270
how to deal with it and keep in mind there's even more in-depth section and you can just click here.

43
00:03:09.270 --> 00:03:14.340
Missing data section and then get a really in-depth view of how to work with a particular topic.

44
00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.280
In this case missing data and you can see here just based off the scrolling that the online documentation

45
00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:26.250
is very in-depth and there's a lot of useful things on the user guide things like input output tools

46
00:03:26.580 --> 00:03:31.740
dealing with more complex topics like reshaping and pivot tables multi indices and even things like

47
00:03:31.800 --> 00:03:33.090
visualization.

48
00:03:33.090 --> 00:03:36.610
Now again we're gonna be covering a lot of this throughout this section of the course.

49
00:03:36.690 --> 00:03:41.990
And later on in the course but I would encourage you to really check out the online documentation whenever

50
00:03:41.990 --> 00:03:47.580
you have a random question of how would you do X or Y empanadas pandas or is pandas capable of dealing

51
00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.130
with x or y data.

52
00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:52.460
Okay so that's it for now.

53
00:03:52.470 --> 00:03:56.220
Let's go ahead and get started by learning about pandas series in the next lecture.

54
00:03:56.220 --> 00:03:56.790
I'll see you there.
