00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.215
In this video and also the next,

00:00:04.215 --> 00:00:09.270
we'll be looking at two ways to get open running with WordPress on our computer.

00:00:09.270 --> 00:00:13.020
We can begin to create themes and test them out.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:18.165
Alternatively, if you have a live hosting provider and would rather use this,

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.580
feel free to go ahead and do that.

00:00:20.580 --> 00:00:26.910
This video is going to cover getting setup with a service called Local by flywheel,

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:30.285
which is our local by flywheel.com.

00:00:30.285 --> 00:00:33.240
In the next video, which is optional,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:37.290
we will cover installing and setting up MUMP as an alternative.

00:00:37.290 --> 00:00:40.530
I would recommend following along with this video

00:00:40.530 --> 00:00:44.375
rather than the next especially if you are a beginner,

00:00:44.375 --> 00:00:47.960
since MUMP can cause problems for a lot of people,

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.060
put this is up to you.

00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:53.855
Let's get started over by going over to the homepage,

00:00:53.855 --> 00:00:56.735
the unpaved versions for teams and agencies.

00:00:56.735 --> 00:00:59.465
But we just need the free community edition,

00:00:59.465 --> 00:01:02.260
which is available for Mac and Windows.

00:01:02.260 --> 00:01:08.395
Flywheel allows us to quickly set up WordPress projects on our computer really easily,

00:01:08.395 --> 00:01:13.045
and also takes care of setting of the server and database photos.

00:01:13.045 --> 00:01:15.210
It has not too great features.

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.970
We can view our site,

00:01:16.970 --> 00:01:20.270
and also the admin section at the click of a button.

00:01:20.270 --> 00:01:25.385
We can also generate a live link to view our project anywhere online,

00:01:25.385 --> 00:01:27.830
and also to share with others.

00:01:27.830 --> 00:01:30.635
Along with lots of more advanced features,

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:35.845
such as the ability to set up WordPress multi-site and so much more.

00:01:35.845 --> 00:01:38.720
To get started, we click on the download link,

00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:41.885
which you just here up at the top here.

00:01:41.885 --> 00:01:44.315
Then choose which platform you would like,

00:01:44.315 --> 00:01:47.800
enter your details and then click on, Get it now.

00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.445
This download may take a few minutes,

00:01:50.445 --> 00:01:54.190
so I'll return back once this is completed.

00:01:55.610 --> 00:01:58.790
Once local has finished downloading and you come

00:01:58.790 --> 00:02:01.220
through the installation for your machine,

00:02:01.220 --> 00:02:05.900
should be taking it to a similar looking startup screen that we have here.

00:02:05.900 --> 00:02:08.530
This is just with a sample test site,

00:02:08.530 --> 00:02:10.315
which comes with the download.

00:02:10.315 --> 00:02:14.170
But when it's go down to this plus icon down at the bottom,

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:16.820
we create our new sites.

00:02:17.090 --> 00:02:21.775
First step is to create a name and it's going to be called

00:02:21.775 --> 00:02:26.410
the Tranquil Spa, go on Continue.

00:02:26.410 --> 00:02:30.280
After this, we get a environment which you want to choose.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:34.815
I'm going to stick with the preferred versions of PHP and MySQL,

00:02:34.815 --> 00:02:37.105
but it is also custom versions too.

00:02:37.105 --> 00:02:42.450
If you feel the need to change any of these versions, continue.

00:02:42.450 --> 00:02:46.480
Next we need to add a username and password to login.

00:02:46.480 --> 00:02:52.305
I'm going to call my username Tranquil underscore admin,

00:02:52.305 --> 00:02:59.745
the password is up to you and want to add mine in here.

00:02:59.745 --> 00:03:04.300
Then the e-mail, which is an e-mail of your choice.

00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:12.845
Then add our site to local by clicking this button,

00:03:12.845 --> 00:03:16.890
give us a few moments to generate our site.

00:03:18.530 --> 00:03:21.275
Once your site has been setup,

00:03:21.275 --> 00:03:23.660
you'll be taken to this page and you've seen

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.160
the green light next to the sign name, you're good to go.

00:03:27.160 --> 00:03:33.125
The two main things to note here on the screen is the buttons in the top corner.

00:03:33.125 --> 00:03:35.330
The first one is view sites,

00:03:35.330 --> 00:03:41.250
this opens up a new word press tab in the browser, so we click on this.

00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.605
This is our actual WordPress installation we are viewing with the default theme.

00:03:48.605 --> 00:03:53.170
This is how easy it is to get setup with WordPress on Local.

00:03:53.170 --> 00:03:56.050
If we now go back over to the Admin,

00:03:56.050 --> 00:03:58.465
is also a admin button just here.

00:03:58.465 --> 00:04:03.005
This will then take us to the login page for the WordPress dashboard

00:04:03.005 --> 00:04:08.360
and this is the username and password which we supplied when setting up our sites.

00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.530
My details were tranquil admin,

00:04:11.530 --> 00:04:14.925
and to the password.

00:04:14.925 --> 00:04:19.150
I'm going to click Remember me, and then Login.

00:04:19.910 --> 00:04:23.390
This is the WordPress dashboard which we'll get much more

00:04:23.390 --> 00:04:25.960
familiar with as we go through the course.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:28.534
It has links where we can select our posts,

00:04:28.534 --> 00:04:30.830
different media assets we want to add.

00:04:30.830 --> 00:04:32.655
We can create new pages,

00:04:32.655 --> 00:04:34.879
we can create or view our comments,

00:04:34.879 --> 00:04:39.590
along with changing any appearance and settings of our WordPress sites.

00:04:39.590 --> 00:04:43.550
But we'll cover all of this as we go throughout the course.

00:04:43.550 --> 00:04:46.040
You can also click on this link up here,

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.045
which will also take us to the same site that see here.

00:04:50.045 --> 00:04:56.105
Another great feature about using flywheel is it also provides a live link.

00:04:56.105 --> 00:04:59.290
If we click on Enable down at the bottom,

00:04:59.290 --> 00:05:05.830
enabling this will generate a link which would go to in the browser on any device.

00:05:05.830 --> 00:05:07.580
If you click on this,

00:05:07.580 --> 00:05:11.719
you can then open it up on your mobile device in different browser

00:05:11.719 --> 00:05:16.625
or you can also share this link with family and friends to show your progress.

00:05:16.625 --> 00:05:21.470
If you're at this stage, we now good to go with creating our WordPress site,

00:05:21.470 --> 00:05:24.455
beginning our theme conversion from Bootstrap.

00:05:24.455 --> 00:05:29.610
I'll see you now in the next section where we'll begin this process.
