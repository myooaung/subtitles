X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.170 --> 00:00:03.855
With all basic loop now, all setup.

00:00:03.855 --> 00:00:07.770
Now will be a good time to add some blog posts to actually leave room.

00:00:07.770 --> 00:00:12.464
We can do this if we go to website and then head over to the dashboard.

00:00:12.464 --> 00:00:14.265
Down in the post section,

00:00:14.265 --> 00:00:17.520
we can go to All posts or Add New.

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:20.880
From here I'm going to add the new post,

00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:23.640
so simply Blog post 1.

00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:30.435
Some simple sample text a paragraph is fine, paste it in.

00:00:30.435 --> 00:00:32.730
We can add some tags.

00:00:32.730 --> 00:00:35.320
Let's go for news,

00:00:36.050 --> 00:00:42.010
updates. Then we publish.

00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:47.140
Lets add two more. Click on "Add New",

00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:52.990
imaginative with titles if you want, Blog post 2.

00:00:53.030 --> 00:00:56.135
Add in some sample contacts,

00:00:56.135 --> 00:01:03.090
then some tags go for make-up and beauty treatments.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:06.840
These types will also display on the screen.

00:01:06.840 --> 00:01:08.375
Once you add these to a loop,

00:01:08.375 --> 00:01:10.695
we can add in some categories.

00:01:10.695 --> 00:01:14.520
When this is fine, you publish.

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.890
Then we'll add a third and final one.

00:01:17.890 --> 00:01:21.200
Goes free. Just below,

00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:22.760
we can choose a new block,

00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:24.875
paste in the content.

00:01:24.875 --> 00:01:27.170
You can of course, click on the plus icon

00:01:27.170 --> 00:01:31.075
here and choose different styles of blocks if you prefer.

00:01:31.075 --> 00:01:39.000
Sub-categories. Let's go for hair and then click on publish.

00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:43.460
Next we need somewhere, it's actually display these blog posts.

00:01:43.460 --> 00:01:46.640
Remember, we've created a blog link in our menu.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:50.630
If we go down to pages and click on this,

00:01:50.630 --> 00:01:55.055
we have all pages on here which we created from our menu earlier.

00:01:55.055 --> 00:01:59.630
Also if we go to website by clicking on this link,

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:02.590
then click on the blog link at the top.

00:02:02.590 --> 00:02:09.090
Always see in the block section is this header and the footer with no content in between.

00:02:09.090 --> 00:02:11.060
Well to display our post in between,

00:02:11.060 --> 00:02:12.750
we need to set this up in the dashboard.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:16.310
We need to go to the dashboard, down to settings,

00:02:16.310 --> 00:02:18.530
and then read in from here,

00:02:18.530 --> 00:02:22.340
just like we set our homepage earlier be the homepage.

00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:26.465
We can also display the posts on the blog page.

00:02:26.465 --> 00:02:28.835
Save these changes.

00:02:28.835 --> 00:02:32.450
Visit our site and then go back over to

00:02:32.450 --> 00:02:35.950
our blog link.You see these posts displaying on here,

00:02:35.950 --> 00:02:38.410
because we are using the index page.

00:02:38.410 --> 00:02:42.620
If you remember earlier when we looked at the template hierarchy,

00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.015
the index page will always be the default page below blog posts.

00:02:47.015 --> 00:02:50.015
If no more specific page can be found.

00:02:50.015 --> 00:02:52.850
Back over to our index PHP.

00:02:52.850 --> 00:02:57.515
We can now begin to construct this to reflect our bootstrap templates.

00:02:57.515 --> 00:02:59.870
If we go to our blog page,

00:02:59.870 --> 00:03:02.645
which is the blog to HTML.

00:03:02.645 --> 00:03:07.080
Want to copy all the content from the main section.

00:03:08.090 --> 00:03:10.550
From this block section here,

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:12.890
probably open it in main tag.

00:03:12.890 --> 00:03:16.880
Then all the way down to the closing main container.

00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.110
Copy this, back to the index page.

00:03:21.110 --> 00:03:24.145
Let's paste this just below the header.

00:03:24.145 --> 00:03:27.680
Back up to the top where we have our blog post.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:30.005
I'm going to delete the first few,

00:03:30.005 --> 00:03:32.570
leaving just one blog post in place.

00:03:32.570 --> 00:03:34.970
Just blow this "coll-sm-8".

00:03:34.970 --> 00:03:41.210
Let's grab this first one and remove and do the same with the second one,

00:03:41.210 --> 00:03:44.920
leaving just one blog post in place.

00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:48.924
This section is going to be pretty important.

00:03:48.924 --> 00:03:54.400
This is going to be the one which we need to loop over inside the WordPress loop.

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:58.480
Then we can use this as a structure for each blog post.

00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:02.395
Rather than having the hard-coded text such as new feature,

00:04:02.395 --> 00:04:06.940
we're going to add a php function or WordPress function inside here,

00:04:06.940 --> 00:04:11.465
which will grab each title from the database and then place it in here.

00:04:11.465 --> 00:04:16.855
With this in mind, we now need to add this as the contents of our WordPress loop.

00:04:16.855 --> 00:04:18.865
We've created the loop below.

00:04:18.865 --> 00:04:21.565
Let's go ahead and grab the opening section,

00:04:21.565 --> 00:04:23.790
which is this top line here.

00:04:23.790 --> 00:04:28.600
We can call this our place. Scroll backup.

00:04:28.820 --> 00:04:31.175
Above all blog post.

00:04:31.175 --> 00:04:34.060
Let's paste this in with a need closes off.

00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:35.975
Back down to our loop.

00:04:35.975 --> 00:04:39.320
We can cut the end while section.

00:04:39.320 --> 00:04:46.100
Take this out and then paste is just after the end of our blog post.

00:04:46.100 --> 00:04:51.620
The next stage is to go through each piece of static content we have in the blog post.

00:04:51.620 --> 00:04:54.474
Then replace them at with WordPress functions.

00:04:54.474 --> 00:04:57.965
Fast write the title and h2 tags.

00:04:57.965 --> 00:05:01.340
This can be replaced with a function called the title.

00:05:01.340 --> 00:05:02.750
This is PHP code.

00:05:02.750 --> 00:05:07.010
We need to open up the PHP tags, close them off.

00:05:07.010 --> 00:05:10.090
Then the function name of the title,

00:05:10.090 --> 00:05:14.215
followed by the brackets semicolon.

00:05:14.215 --> 00:05:19.400
This as expected, will retrieve the blog post title, for each post.

00:05:19.400 --> 00:05:22.430
If we save this and then go over to the browser,

00:05:22.430 --> 00:05:25.840
we can see what effect this has, reload.

00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:31.060
We have the dynamic title of blog posts 3, 2, 1.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.835
All the rest of the content has just been replaced with

00:05:34.835 --> 00:05:38.915
the static HTML and this is the same for all three posts.

00:05:38.915 --> 00:05:41.980
We need to go ahead and make this more dynamic.

00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:47.165
We can do this again with WordPress functions starting with the date,

00:05:47.165 --> 00:05:52.530
thus remove the hard-coded date into the PHP.

00:05:52.530 --> 00:05:55.220
Inside here we're going to echo to display this,

00:05:55.220 --> 00:05:59.160
the browser and a function called get the date.

00:05:59.690 --> 00:06:05.525
Get the date is going to take in free arguments inside the quotations.

00:06:05.525 --> 00:06:07.805
Is going to be a capital F,

00:06:07.805 --> 00:06:13.820
a lowercase j, then a comma to separate this from a capital Y.

00:06:13.820 --> 00:06:15.680
If you're new to PHP,

00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:17.000
these letters F, j,

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.920
and Y may look strange.

00:06:18.920 --> 00:06:22.130
All we're doing here is setting the formats which we want the day,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:24.245
month and year to be displayed.

00:06:24.245 --> 00:06:27.410
For example, do you want a blog post created in

00:06:27.410 --> 00:06:31.745
January to be displayed as the word January or just Jan,

00:06:31.745 --> 00:06:34.240
or even a month number of one.

00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:36.920
If you want to find out more about this function,

00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:41.240
you can head over to WordPress and search for formatting dates and time.

00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.980
Inside here, if we scroll down,

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:45.940
we can see what each one of these letters represents.

00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:48.500
For example, we've used the capital Y,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:52.490
which is going to be a four-digit year, just like we see here.

00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:55.475
We can do the same for the month and the days too,

00:06:55.475 --> 00:06:58.770
to get the exact format which we want.

00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:01.450
Now if we give this a save,

00:07:01.450 --> 00:07:03.695
we can check this out in the browser,

00:07:03.695 --> 00:07:09.040
reload our blog page and we see that date each post has been created.

00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:12.740
Next, we want to create the author just afterwards.

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:16.655
On the same line, we have a link to the blog post offer.

00:07:16.655 --> 00:07:18.800
Rather than the hard-coded version.

00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:23.580
We're going to replace this with a WordPress function called the author.

00:07:24.350 --> 00:07:28.040
This is simple enough, it doesn't take in any arguments,

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.925
it will just crop the author of the posts, we can reload.

00:07:31.925 --> 00:07:34.955
The author in our case is the logged in user,

00:07:34.955 --> 00:07:36.895
which is tranquil admin.

00:07:36.895 --> 00:07:40.070
I'm just going to add the word by just before.

00:07:40.070 --> 00:07:44.675
Just follow a link here you can add by, say this.

00:07:44.675 --> 00:07:48.270
In fact it needs a space just afterwards.

00:07:48.290 --> 00:07:53.875
Reload. Now onto these text below.

00:07:53.875 --> 00:07:56.120
We can make these more dynamic too,

00:07:56.120 --> 00:07:59.230
by using a WordPress function called the tags.

00:07:59.230 --> 00:08:01.525
Instead of this hard-coded version,

00:08:01.525 --> 00:08:03.965
we're going to remove this.

00:08:03.965 --> 00:08:06.905
Add a PHP function,

00:08:06.905 --> 00:08:09.875
which is the underscore tags.

00:08:09.875 --> 00:08:14.590
This function can take in upto three arguments inside the brackets.

00:08:14.590 --> 00:08:18.985
The first one is the text which you want to add before the tags are displayed.

00:08:18.985 --> 00:08:21.385
I'm going to add in the word tagged,

00:08:21.385 --> 00:08:22.870
followed by a colon,

00:08:22.870 --> 00:08:26.625
a space and a comma just afterwards.

00:08:26.625 --> 00:08:29.535
The next one is going to be the separator.

00:08:29.535 --> 00:08:33.175
This is what is going to appear in-between each tag.

00:08:33.175 --> 00:08:36.855
By default, the tags will be separated by a comma.

00:08:36.855 --> 00:08:39.400
In our theme, we use the tilda icon.

00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:42.645
Let's add this in with the space either sides.

00:08:42.645 --> 00:08:45.394
We can also add in a optional third argument,

00:08:45.394 --> 00:08:48.560
which is any text you want to display after the tag.

00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:51.075
But just going to leave this as it is,

00:08:51.075 --> 00:08:53.840
over to the browser.

00:08:54.530 --> 00:08:58.850
Reload. Our blog post feed doesn't have any tags.

00:08:58.850 --> 00:09:02.390
For the second one has the before text of tags.

00:09:02.390 --> 00:09:08.600
We have each individual tag with the tilda separating each one, also known as two.

00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:11.315
If we hover over each one of these tags.

00:09:11.315 --> 00:09:15.950
These also links too and if we click on these it also take

00:09:15.950 --> 00:09:21.185
us to a page which will display all posts with this particular tag.

00:09:21.185 --> 00:09:24.095
We had multiple posts with the same tag.

00:09:24.095 --> 00:09:26.470
It would all appear on a list.

00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:29.885
This is as almost now finished with the blog post.

00:09:29.885 --> 00:09:33.050
The final part of the bottom is the content.

00:09:33.050 --> 00:09:35.690
We already know how to grab this.

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.570
We already have the function down at the bottom,

00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:40.580
which is the content.

00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.125
That's could deserve a place.

00:09:43.125 --> 00:09:46.860
Then move this back up to our blog.

00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:55.105
At this in place of our lorem ipsum text at this end and let's reload.

00:09:55.105 --> 00:09:57.375
Now on a blog post listing.

00:09:57.375 --> 00:10:01.490
Just like this, the amount of content we have doesn't look too bad.

00:10:01.490 --> 00:10:04.700
But if this was a lot longer such as five, six,

00:10:04.700 --> 00:10:09.210
seven paragraphs, each page would get really long in place of this content.

00:10:09.210 --> 00:10:11.855
What we often want to do on a page like this,

00:10:11.855 --> 00:10:14.540
is to shorten the text which displays.

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:18.350
We can do this with a WordPress function called the Excerpt.

00:10:18.350 --> 00:10:20.120
Rather than the content,

00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:23.895
we're going to place this to the Excerpt.

00:10:23.895 --> 00:10:27.470
This should now display in the browser a shorter version.

00:10:27.470 --> 00:10:29.920
This page doesn't get too long.

00:10:29.920 --> 00:10:33.245
Then if the user wants to read the full version,

00:10:33.245 --> 00:10:36.875
they can then click on this blog post and they will be taken to a full

00:10:36.875 --> 00:10:41.850
single page.This is what we will get to work with in the next video.
