00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:03.210
In our blog page, you may have noticed that we don't

00:00:03.210 --> 00:00:05.505
have the sidebar on the right hand side,

00:00:05.505 --> 00:00:08.220
which we had in our bootstrap templates.

00:00:08.220 --> 00:00:10.935
This is because we still have this located

00:00:10.935 --> 00:00:14.445
inside of our Wordpress loop in the else section.

00:00:14.445 --> 00:00:19.320
This won't render to the screen while we currently have any blog posts.

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:26.099
To fix this, we can go to our index.php and then if we go to our else section,

00:00:26.099 --> 00:00:28.845
just afterwards, we have this aside section,

00:00:28.845 --> 00:00:31.605
which is the wrapper for our sidebar.

00:00:31.605 --> 00:00:35.260
If we select all of the aside section,

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.250
then also they close and roll on container.

00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:41.790
Since everything that needs to be contained inside of that.

00:00:41.790 --> 00:00:47.885
That's just bring this up. Then I'm going to add this just after

00:00:47.885 --> 00:00:54.190
the next and previous postlink just above the footer section, we can paste this in.

00:00:54.190 --> 00:00:56.885
Leaving in place the assigned section,

00:00:56.885 --> 00:01:00.520
I'm going take away all of the divs inside here.

00:01:00.520 --> 00:01:04.850
So encodes all the blocks from our sidebar and we can now

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:09.515
use this content to go inside of our sidebar.php.

00:01:09.515 --> 00:01:12.425
Just tidy simple little bits.

00:01:12.425 --> 00:01:19.040
Take the contents and then open up the sidebar and go to our sidebar.php.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.650
We can paste this content inside here.

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:27.140
In a similar way that we did with the header and the footer,

00:01:27.140 --> 00:01:29.150
inside of our index.php ,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:33.745
we can reintroduce the contents of a sidebar using a WordPress function.

00:01:33.745 --> 00:01:38.450
Here at the bottom, we used get footer for the sidebar as you probably guessed,

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:40.840
we need to use get sidebar.

00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:43.485
Open and close the PHP.

00:01:43.485 --> 00:01:47.689
Then Wordpress function which gets underscore sidebar,

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.120
the brackets and the semicolon.

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:52.100
By default, get sidebar,

00:01:52.100 --> 00:01:55.660
we'll look for a file called sidebar.php.

00:01:55.660 --> 00:02:00.185
If you ever have the need to introduce more than one sidebar into your theme,

00:02:00.185 --> 00:02:03.270
such as a sidebar-dark.php.

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:08.180
If we had this file, we will, would then remove

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:13.985
the sidebar section and then just add the name of dark inside here.

00:02:13.985 --> 00:02:17.525
Then this would look for the sidebar dark.php file,

00:02:17.525 --> 00:02:20.435
and then add this in place of the default.

00:02:20.435 --> 00:02:25.690
We don't need this, so I'm just going to delete this and until its empty.

00:02:25.690 --> 00:02:29.840
This is now exactly what we had before in our bootstrap templates.

00:02:29.840 --> 00:02:35.660
The only difference is the sidebar contents of now being outsourced into a separate file,

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:38.270
just like with the header and footer.

00:02:38.270 --> 00:02:45.775
Now we can try this out in the browser and the sidebar is now re-introduced to our page.

00:02:45.775 --> 00:02:48.890
We will return back to the sidebar next,

00:02:48.890 --> 00:02:55.230
where we will replace all of this HTML with dynamic content, telling to WordPress.
