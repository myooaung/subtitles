00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:03.630
Our images inside of

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:07.620
our WordPress Theme have not been working since we began the conversion.

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:11.395
This is something which we're going to fix in this video.

00:00:11.395 --> 00:00:16.605
If you go to right-click and then go to the developer tools with inspects,

00:00:16.605 --> 00:00:19.650
we can check out the console by clicking on this tab.

00:00:19.650 --> 00:00:23.955
We have a list of four or four messages of NOT_FOUND.

00:00:23.955 --> 00:00:27.465
These all four of our images as you can see here.

00:00:27.465 --> 00:00:30.794
This is something which we can fix pretty easily.

00:00:30.794 --> 00:00:35.095
It really is just a case of changing the file paths for the image source.

00:00:35.095 --> 00:00:39.090
Let's begin at the top with the main background image,

00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:41.475
which the in header.php.

00:00:41.475 --> 00:00:44.015
If you want to relocate the image elements,

00:00:44.015 --> 00:00:47.645
which is a neat feature section, scroll down.

00:00:47.645 --> 00:00:49.865
This is what we need to just hear.

00:00:49.865 --> 00:00:52.370
I going to replaces image source.

00:00:52.370 --> 00:00:56.530
Before our file path for going to enter the PHP,

00:00:56.530 --> 00:00:58.605
open and close this off.

00:00:58.605 --> 00:01:01.880
Inside here we're going to echo a PHP string.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:04.835
Then we can use the escape URL function,

00:01:04.835 --> 00:01:08.090
which will check and also clean the provided URL,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:10.915
removing any characters which are not allowed,

00:01:10.915 --> 00:01:15.860
then just as with we did when we added the CSS in JavaScript files in the functions,

00:01:15.860 --> 00:01:19.040
we can make use of gets template URI.

00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.410
It's point to the root directory of our theme.

00:01:27.260 --> 00:01:29.820
Are brackets on the ends?

00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.515
Are semicolons at the end?

00:01:31.515 --> 00:01:34.805
We also need to add a forward slash before the images folder.

00:01:34.805 --> 00:01:40.580
Since this is not added by default of the project and reload.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:43.955
Now, we now have our first image back on screen.

00:01:43.955 --> 00:01:49.220
Now is just a case of going through the rest of the theme's images and then [inaudible].

00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.740
You can have a copy and paste this or you can type this out

00:01:51.740 --> 00:01:54.500
manually if you prefer to speed things up.

00:01:54.500 --> 00:01:56.300
I'm going to copy everything.

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.690
An opening PHP tag right through to the forward slash, copied this.

00:02:02.690 --> 00:02:07.080
We can find the rest of the images in our index.PHP.

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:11.935
Let's do a search with command or control F,

00:02:11.935 --> 00:02:14.065
search for the image tags.

00:02:14.065 --> 00:02:16.555
Now copy and paste our PHP.

00:02:16.555 --> 00:02:21.235
The first one, the second one,

00:02:21.235 --> 00:02:27.770
the candles, the retreat image.

00:02:27.770 --> 00:02:30.910
The divide is needed to

00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:39.115
keep going down we've got another image here for a divider.

00:02:39.115 --> 00:02:41.485
We've got the massage image,

00:02:41.485 --> 00:02:45.190
we've got the facial cosmetics,

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:47.065
and that looks like them all.

00:02:47.065 --> 00:02:50.895
Let's save this and check the all linked now the browser,

00:02:50.895 --> 00:02:54.290
I'll scroll up and down and check only images are where

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:57.155
they should be and everything looks fine.

00:02:57.155 --> 00:02:59.705
If you do have any problems with any images,

00:02:59.705 --> 00:03:03.700
make sure you all have the PHP code inserted in the right place.

00:03:03.700 --> 00:03:06.480
That's our images, on our work again.

00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:12.300
Next up we'll take a look at the template hierarchy, unused from page.
