00:00:01.460 --> 00:00:07.020
Early in the course, we added in a sidebar with the archive section.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:09.810
These dates which are displayed are dynamic,

00:00:09.810 --> 00:00:13.440
meaning WordPress automatically adds in these dates,

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.610
when a blog post is available in a particular month and year.

00:00:17.610 --> 00:00:20.865
If we go ahead and click on a particular date,

00:00:20.865 --> 00:00:24.690
we see that the post available are for the given month.

00:00:24.690 --> 00:00:27.450
We can see this open URL.

00:00:27.450 --> 00:00:32.415
We see the year followed by the month the blog post was created.

00:00:32.415 --> 00:00:34.860
This all works pretty fine at the moment,

00:00:34.860 --> 00:00:37.245
so there's not a lot of work left to do.

00:00:37.245 --> 00:00:42.294
The only thing I am going to change is to make this page a custom archive templates,

00:00:42.294 --> 00:00:48.250
which will also show the month we are viewing rather than this default index of PHP.

00:00:48.250 --> 00:00:53.385
A file called archive.php will be recognized by WordPress,

00:00:53.385 --> 00:00:56.385
and we're going to use this for this archives view.

00:00:56.385 --> 00:00:58.220
Like all of the other templates,

00:00:58.220 --> 00:01:01.564
we're going to add a new file in the root of our project.

00:01:01.564 --> 00:01:05.770
This one is the archive with the.php extension.

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:08.510
We've just seen with all the functionality of

00:01:08.510 --> 00:01:11.780
this view is very similar to our normal blog.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:16.460
I'm going to copy and paste in the contents of the index.php.

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:19.735
Let's select all, copy this,

00:01:19.735 --> 00:01:23.310
paste this in to the archives templates,

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:27.065
and then we can change the comments up at the top.

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:29.990
Rather than this being the main template file,

00:01:29.990 --> 00:01:32.750
we're going to change this to the template,

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:37.170
for displaying archive pages.

00:01:37.670 --> 00:01:43.730
All we need to do is to add a WordPress function called The archive title,

00:01:43.730 --> 00:01:46.835
and I'm going to add mine inside of the block section,

00:01:46.835 --> 00:01:48.425
just underneath the col,

00:01:48.425 --> 00:01:50.815
md, eight section just here.

00:01:50.815 --> 00:01:54.510
Let's do this. Immediately underneath this,

00:01:54.510 --> 00:01:57.075
this is a php function,

00:01:57.075 --> 00:02:00.855
with the name of the archive title,

00:02:00.855 --> 00:02:05.750
and the brackets, and then the semicolon at the end.

00:02:05.750 --> 00:02:10.915
Inside here we're going to add two parameters separated by a comma.

00:02:10.915 --> 00:02:14.570
This is going to be surrounded in a level 3 heading.

00:02:14.570 --> 00:02:19.460
It can add to the HTML of h3, the opening tag.

00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:23.305
Then afterwards, we can close off our h3.

00:02:23.305 --> 00:02:26.720
I'm also going to add a horizontal line.

00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:30.620
Let's add a hr, just before the closing tag,

00:02:30.620 --> 00:02:34.320
and this will add a line just underneath the title.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:38.185
We can go with the browser, and check this out.

00:02:38.185 --> 00:02:39.920
Go to the archives,

00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:41.495
click on any date.

00:02:41.495 --> 00:02:46.805
This function will now show the month of the blog posts which we are currently viewing.

00:02:46.805 --> 00:02:50.420
The user knows exactly where they are on the site.

00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.340
This is just a small change,

00:02:52.340 --> 00:02:55.475
but a really useful one for the user experience,

00:02:55.475 --> 00:02:59.340
so they know exactly which page they are viewing.
