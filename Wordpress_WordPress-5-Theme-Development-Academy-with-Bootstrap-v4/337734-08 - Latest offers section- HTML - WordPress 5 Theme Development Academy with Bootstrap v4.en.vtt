00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.455
We're making good progress with our bootstrap theme

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:08.145
and now is the time to move on to the latest of the section.

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:11.730
The section will be just below this welcome section we created in

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:15.510
the last video and if you go to the final version here,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:18.360
this is a section we are going to be creating now.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:22.800
It will give us more practice using cards and also columns for layout,

00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:26.475
along with looking at small bootstrap classes which are available.

00:00:26.475 --> 00:00:29.700
In this video, we're going to be adding all HTML for

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:33.779
the section along with the necessary bootstrap classes.

00:00:33.779 --> 00:00:38.790
However, little things such as the price over the top here will be custom CSS,

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:42.390
and we'll move on to styling in the next video.

00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:46.600
On wards with the HTML in our index page.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:50.380
Let's go down to the bottom below the closing divs.

00:00:50.380 --> 00:00:51.820
Just above the JavaScript,

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.795
we can create a new div.

00:00:53.795 --> 00:00:58.640
This new div is going to have a class of container fluid.

00:01:02.570 --> 00:01:05.890
We want the text to be aligned in the center,

00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:07.885
so we can have bootstrap classes.

00:01:07.885 --> 00:01:11.730
We're going to have a dark background which you can see just on here.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:14.305
We can do this with a bootstrap class of

00:01:14.305 --> 00:01:19.465
bg-dark and then finally some padding on the top and bottom,

00:01:19.465 --> 00:01:25.500
which we can add with PY for the y-axis and the value of five to keep it consistent.

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:29.355
Inside here we add our familiar row.

00:01:29.355 --> 00:01:35.280
So add a new div with the class of row.

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:37.815
That's all we need for this one.

00:01:37.815 --> 00:01:41.450
Then inside we're going to create the title,

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:43.985
which is the "Latest Spa Offers".

00:01:43.985 --> 00:01:47.345
We'll do this in a similar way to this one up at the top.

00:01:47.345 --> 00:01:51.605
We're going to create a div or a section with a span or width

00:01:51.605 --> 00:01:57.330
of six columns and then we'll offset it three columns to place this in the center.

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:05.670
So open up the div, the class, col-md,

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:09.500
so this is six columns on medium devices and both,

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:13.755
meaning anything below the medium sized devices will be default width.

00:02:13.755 --> 00:02:18.800
We can also provide the offsets on medium devices to be three columns,

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:21.560
pushing into the center of the page.

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:24.990
Our title in the h3,

00:02:25.130 --> 00:02:29.390
this is going to have the class of text slides.

00:02:29.390 --> 00:02:34.040
Since we're using nice dark background colors and the text of "Latest

00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:39.105
Spa Offers". Okay, good.

00:02:39.105 --> 00:02:41.025
Below this we need our image.

00:02:41.025 --> 00:02:44.555
This image is going to be a similar one to the one above,

00:02:44.555 --> 00:02:46.160
which is just this one here.

00:02:46.160 --> 00:02:49.590
It's going to have a slightly different color since we've

00:02:49.590 --> 00:02:53.355
got a different background which are the same with the image.

00:02:53.355 --> 00:02:55.455
So imj, the source,

00:02:55.455 --> 00:02:57.285
this is in the images folder,

00:02:57.285 --> 00:03:04.570
and this one is the divider-silver.png The alt text,

00:03:05.450 --> 00:03:10.035
simply divider and then a bootstrap class.

00:03:10.035 --> 00:03:13.955
So we're just going to add some padding on the bottom of this, starts in spacing,

00:03:13.955 --> 00:03:18.830
so below we're padding bottom or pb and the value of four.

00:03:18.830 --> 00:03:23.240
Also, we can set the width to be custom width w-25,

00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:24.605
which has already looked at,

00:03:24.605 --> 00:03:27.595
is a width of 25 percent.

00:03:27.595 --> 00:03:30.770
Then we can take a look, reload,

00:03:30.770 --> 00:03:35.200
and go below our welcome section and there's our title.

00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:41.420
Now we need to create a new row just below for these three cards on here.

00:03:41.420 --> 00:03:46.910
Each card is going to be in a width of four columns in its own separate div.

00:03:46.910 --> 00:03:50.420
So let's begin by creating the first section.

00:03:50.420 --> 00:03:55.350
We need to create new div just below this row.

00:03:56.390 --> 00:04:00.210
Div with the class of row.

00:04:00.210 --> 00:04:06.265
Close this off and make sure this is still inside of the surrounding container.

00:04:06.265 --> 00:04:14.080
We can now construct our div with the class of col-sm-4.

00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:21.005
This is a third of the page width on smaller devices under both.

00:04:21.005 --> 00:04:24.180
Each one of these is going to be a card,

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.605
add a div with the class of cards,

00:04:28.605 --> 00:04:32.360
and this will give us a chance to do a similar thing that we've done in the last video,

00:04:32.360 --> 00:04:34.070
where we can add a card header,

00:04:34.070 --> 00:04:38.485
a card body, and this will add all the nice bootstrap styling photos.

00:04:38.485 --> 00:04:42.105
First of all, let's add a card header.

00:04:42.105 --> 00:04:45.670
Let's add this in a level four heading.

00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:50.380
We need to give this a class of card header.

00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.555
Since it's a header up at the top,

00:04:53.555 --> 00:04:57.575
we're going to add some padding to give it a little bit spacing from the top.

00:04:57.575 --> 00:05:02.355
We can do that with py-5,

00:05:02.355 --> 00:05:05.710
and this will apply to the top and bottom of the header.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:10.830
Inside here we're going to add the text of family swim package.

00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:14.960
Of course, type in any text which you prefer inside here,

00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:17.705
followed by a span with the price.

00:05:17.705 --> 00:05:20.370
I'm going to add 60 for this,

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.330
and this is going to be the price which sits on the top

00:05:23.330 --> 00:05:27.370
here and we'll position this using CSS in the next video.

00:05:27.370 --> 00:05:29.914
But now that we just adding the HTML,

00:05:29.914 --> 00:05:32.495
so I'm going to add a class to this span.

00:05:32.495 --> 00:05:36.720
The cost is going to be equal to fond-weight-bold.

00:05:37.220 --> 00:05:41.545
This will just make it a little bit bolder so it stands out more.

00:05:41.545 --> 00:05:46.810
Underneath our h4 we can then add the card body.

00:05:48.470 --> 00:05:53.230
We've already used this class before, this is card-body.

00:05:54.140 --> 00:05:58.545
Before we go any further, let's check this out over in the browser.

00:05:58.545 --> 00:06:03.570
Refresh, and there's our card header and our card's body just below.

00:06:03.570 --> 00:06:06.185
This card body is going to get the text,

00:06:06.185 --> 00:06:07.610
which is just on here,

00:06:07.610 --> 00:06:11.905
and then another list with three list items.

00:06:11.905 --> 00:06:15.705
Okay, let's get work inside our card body.

00:06:15.705 --> 00:06:21.600
The first thing we're going to do in here is add a blockquote text.

00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.530
This blockquote also means a bootstrap class of blockquotes.

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:28.305
So a class of blockquotes,

00:06:28.305 --> 00:06:32.065
and that's at the margin on the bottom to a value of zero.

00:06:32.065 --> 00:06:35.090
We can add our text inside the P elements.

00:06:35.090 --> 00:06:39.090
This text is going to be our most popular swim package,

00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:48.550
great value for families or groups of 12 people.

00:06:50.390 --> 00:06:55.585
Now we need to go below the blockquote and below this div for the card body.

00:06:55.585 --> 00:06:58.600
Then inside here we're going to add an another list,

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:02.180
which is going to have a class of list group.

00:07:02.690 --> 00:07:06.030
This is going to be our free list items.

00:07:06.030 --> 00:07:10.150
So the first one is going to have a class.

00:07:10.150 --> 00:07:17.860
This one is going to be list-group-item, followed by font-italic.

00:07:19.610 --> 00:07:23.920
The text is up to 12 people.

00:07:24.060 --> 00:07:26.200
You can type the next one out,

00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:31.435
so I'm going to copy and paste in two more times since it's got the same classes.

00:07:31.435 --> 00:07:35.150
The text on this one is private sessions,

00:07:37.910 --> 00:07:43.850
and then the third one is going to be swim lessons also available.

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:50.175
There we go up to the browser.

00:07:50.175 --> 00:07:52.560
Now let's go to the first tab,

00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:55.935
reload, and it's not looking good.

00:07:55.935 --> 00:08:01.840
We need to now replicate this two more times for our second and third section.

00:08:01.840 --> 00:08:06.025
So to do this, I'm going to copy this to avoid a lot of repetition.

00:08:06.025 --> 00:08:07.270
If you want small practice,

00:08:07.270 --> 00:08:09.835
you can go ahead and type this out yourself.

00:08:09.835 --> 00:08:14.450
I'm going to go ahead and locate the closing div.

00:08:16.410 --> 00:08:19.500
In fact we just need the col-sm-4,

00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:26.490
so we'll copy this div here and the col-sm-4 section.

00:08:26.490 --> 00:08:29.555
Make sure you're still two closing div tags at the end,

00:08:29.555 --> 00:08:33.330
which is for the row and the outside container.

00:08:33.590 --> 00:08:36.435
Paste this in just below.

00:08:36.435 --> 00:08:39.880
This one is going to be for the bride,

00:08:42.170 --> 00:08:46.510
and then the price on this one is going to be 40.

00:08:46.510 --> 00:08:53.640
The text, this one is going to be "Our wedding packages are perfect for your big day".

00:09:01.790 --> 00:09:06.460
Then we can cater for groups, large or small.

00:09:11.030 --> 00:09:14.180
Then all we're left to do is the free list items.

00:09:14.180 --> 00:09:17.810
The first one is going to be her make-up and this is going to be using

00:09:17.810 --> 00:09:23.255
the HTML entity of amp, add the makeup.

00:09:23.255 --> 00:09:27.960
The next one is going to be for groups of any size.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:39.240
This one is going to be champagne and cocktails available.

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.770
We just have one more now.

00:09:45.770 --> 00:09:46.895
So down at the bottom,

00:09:46.895 --> 00:09:49.160
again make sure to use these two div tags

00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:51.770
spread at the end and then paste this in and for

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:58.220
the third and final time and it's going to be weekend pass for $60.

00:10:00.810 --> 00:10:06.340
I want to grab the text for this one just here,

00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:10.090
and add the same between the P elements.

00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:14.400
This one is going to be pool and sauna.

00:10:17.870 --> 00:10:26.970
Then full use of our gym and the semicolon at the end there.

00:10:26.970 --> 00:10:32.730
The third one is going to be includes two treatments per person.

00:10:38.210 --> 00:10:40.845
Okay, good. I think that is it now,

00:10:40.845 --> 00:10:44.570
down if we go to the bottom and just add a quick comment,

00:10:44.570 --> 00:10:52.960
just say this is a closing container and the same for the row.

00:10:54.230 --> 00:10:56.340
Good. So over to Chrome,

00:10:56.340 --> 00:10:59.610
we can check this out and can select the tab for the project,

00:10:59.610 --> 00:11:02.865
reload and that's our three sections now.

00:11:02.865 --> 00:11:04.550
If we shrink this down as well,

00:11:04.550 --> 00:11:06.920
we can see this will be fully responsive by

00:11:06.920 --> 00:11:10.580
default because of the bootstrap classes which we've added.

00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:15.965
We will play around with this a little in the next video when we add some custom CSS.

00:11:15.965 --> 00:11:18.365
but for now though the majority is in place.

00:11:18.365 --> 00:11:20.460
So we'll see you next.
