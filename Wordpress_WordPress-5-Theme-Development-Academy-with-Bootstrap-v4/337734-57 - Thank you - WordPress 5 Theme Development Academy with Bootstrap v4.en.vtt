Congratulations for reaching the end of this course.

00:00:03.615 --> 00:00:07.695
I hope you've enjoyed learning all about WordPress theme development.

00:00:07.695 --> 00:00:10.740
By now you should have all the skills which you need,

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:14.610
to build almost any type of website using WordPress.

00:00:14.610 --> 00:00:18.825
You've covered a lot of ground and gained a lot of skills along the way.

00:00:18.825 --> 00:00:20.490
Starting at the beginning,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:26.505
where we built a HTML and CSS version of our theme using Bootstrap 4.

00:00:26.505 --> 00:00:28.755
We learned about the grid system,

00:00:28.755 --> 00:00:32.055
rating responsive layouts, signing,

00:00:32.055 --> 00:00:34.365
utilities, and so much more.

00:00:34.365 --> 00:00:37.830
Once we had the theme exactly how we wanted it to look,

00:00:37.830 --> 00:00:41.160
we then set up WordPress and began the conversion to

00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.154
WordPress by breaking up our site into templates.

00:00:45.154 --> 00:00:50.885
We also looked how WordPress handles loading of style sheets and scripts.

00:00:50.885 --> 00:00:54.410
We created menus, used the WordPress loop,

00:00:54.410 --> 00:00:56.375
added a lot to our blog,

00:00:56.375 --> 00:00:59.300
the chars pagination, built the hooks,

00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:02.840
a dynamic sidebar, and conditional rendering.

00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:07.475
We added comments to our blog and all of the page templates,

00:01:07.475 --> 00:01:10.345
make this exactly how we wanted.

00:01:10.345 --> 00:01:14.645
Later, on in the course, we also looked at some of the more advanced features,

00:01:14.645 --> 00:01:18.640
such as custom fields, Bing translation, widgets,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.880
and contact forms, along with taken steps to allow

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:28.240
the end user to customize many parts of our theme without needing to go.

00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.155
Leaving you with the skills you need to build almost any type of WordPress website.

00:01:33.155 --> 00:01:35.360
Whether that's for a personal site,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:37.625
a friend or family, a business,

00:01:37.625 --> 00:01:39.250
or a paying client,

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:42.950
you now have the skills to offer a truly custom service.

00:01:42.950 --> 00:01:46.100
So thank you so much for taking this course and

00:01:46.100 --> 00:01:49.740
hopefully see you again in the future in the class.
