00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:03.795
At moment, we have our scripts and our styles

00:00:03.795 --> 00:00:07.125
directly added to our header and footer area.

00:00:07.125 --> 00:00:10.860
This is from earlier when we created the Bootstrap template.

00:00:10.860 --> 00:00:13.455
We have the CSS in the header.

00:00:13.455 --> 00:00:15.600
Then in the footer down at the bottom,

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.550
we have our JavaScript.

00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:20.520
If we visit the word precise,

00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:25.754
we don't see any styling and also things such as the images and icons.

00:00:25.754 --> 00:00:29.310
What we're going to do now is to remove these hard-coded links,

00:00:29.310 --> 00:00:32.780
and then move them over to the functions.php.

00:00:32.780 --> 00:00:38.600
We can then include them into WordPress by using functions called wp_enqueue_style,

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:44.125
row style sheets, and for our script to obey wp_enqueue_script.

00:00:44.125 --> 00:00:46.595
But why do we need to do this at all?

00:00:46.595 --> 00:00:48.515
Well, there are a few reasons.

00:00:48.515 --> 00:00:53.335
But imagine, our WordPress theme required a jQuery for it to work,

00:00:53.335 --> 00:00:59.705
and then imagine if we had two plugins and both those plugins also require a jQuerry.

00:00:59.705 --> 00:01:04.375
If jQuery was hardcoded in civil theme and also into the plugins.

00:01:04.375 --> 00:01:09.365
This would mean WordPress would need to download jQuery three separate times.

00:01:09.365 --> 00:01:11.540
This would slow down our sites.

00:01:11.540 --> 00:01:15.575
After this, they could also be different versions of the same script,

00:01:15.575 --> 00:01:17.935
which may cause version conflicts.

00:01:17.935 --> 00:01:21.785
Also, a particular script may also be bundled with WordPress,

00:01:21.785 --> 00:01:24.520
so we may not need to download it at all.

00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.890
Using these functions, this will allow WordPress to

00:01:27.890 --> 00:01:32.045
takeover and only load exactly what is required.

00:01:32.045 --> 00:01:37.195
It can also take care of any additional scripts which are dependencies to.

00:01:37.195 --> 00:01:43.665
Let's begin over in the header.php by removing the style sheets from here.

00:01:43.665 --> 00:01:45.930
We have all four of these,

00:01:45.930 --> 00:01:50.935
and then we can also remove all these scripts from the bottom of the footer.

00:01:50.935 --> 00:01:55.199
We have two here, we can also remove these commands,

00:01:55.199 --> 00:01:59.790
save the file, and I can go over to the functions.php.

00:01:59.790 --> 00:02:03.940
We can add these back-in by creating a PHP function.

00:02:03.940 --> 00:02:05.810
Down at the bottom,

00:02:05.810 --> 00:02:08.180
still within our PHP section,

00:02:08.180 --> 00:02:10.760
we're going to add a PHP function

00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:17.465
called tranquil_scripts as the brackets just afterwards.

00:02:17.465 --> 00:02:20.990
First of all, I'm going to add the styles without

00:02:20.990 --> 00:02:25.485
a comments about the top, so add the styles.

00:02:25.485 --> 00:02:33.685
Then inside here, we can start with the WordPress function called wp_enqueue_style,

00:02:33.685 --> 00:02:36.255
semicolon at the end.

00:02:36.255 --> 00:02:40.200
Wp_enqueue_style can take up to five parameters.

00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.340
The first one is the name of the style sheets,

00:02:43.340 --> 00:02:47.370
which we're going to add in as a string of Bootstrap call.

00:02:47.690 --> 00:02:51.030
This name must also be unique.

00:02:51.030 --> 00:02:53.960
The second parameter we need is the source.

00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:59.375
Here, we can use a WordPress function called get_template_directory_uri,

00:02:59.375 --> 00:03:03.800
which appoints the roots or the home directory of our project.

00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.790
Let's add this in now. So [inaudible] ,

00:03:05.790 --> 00:03:14.510
and it's your point to our home directory,

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:17.720
which is all our files and folders on the left here.

00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.655
We then use a dot, and then we can add in a file path to our CSS.

00:03:22.655 --> 00:03:25.490
This is going to be our minified Bootstrap version,

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.680
which is in the CSS folder.

00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.510
As a string, we can add /CSS,

00:03:31.510 --> 00:03:35.140
and then the file is the bootstrap.min.css.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.290
If we give this to save now,

00:03:42.290 --> 00:03:44.925
close the sidebar, over to the browser,

00:03:44.925 --> 00:03:46.530
and then hit "Reload".

00:03:46.530 --> 00:03:49.990
We don't see any changes to our project at the moment.

00:03:49.990 --> 00:03:51.885
To actually run the function,

00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:53.640
we need to add an action,

00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.085
and this action is going to be responsible for starting off our function.

00:03:58.085 --> 00:04:01.340
Just below, we can add_action.

00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:05.245
This is just like we added above for our setup.

00:04:05.245 --> 00:04:08.055
This time now, this is going to be our scripts.

00:04:08.055 --> 00:04:13.020
The first argument is to wp_enqueue_scripts,

00:04:13.020 --> 00:04:19.000
and then the second one is our custom function name of tranquil_scripts.

00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:24.185
This action will run our custom function of tranquil_scripts,

00:04:24.185 --> 00:04:26.020
which is this section here.

00:04:26.020 --> 00:04:31.340
Each time the WordPress is wp_enqueue_scripts function is called.

00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.145
Now, we can save this, and then it refresh the browser.

00:04:35.145 --> 00:04:38.725
Now, how Bootstrap styles have been applied?

00:04:38.725 --> 00:04:44.395
The are also small style sheets we need to add to this function such as Font Awesome,

00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:48.350
our Google Fonts, and also our Custom CSS.

00:04:48.350 --> 00:04:50.720
Let's do exactly the same as before.

00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:53.710
I'm going to copy and paste this style.

00:04:53.710 --> 00:04:58.000
This time, I'm going to call this fontawesome as the name.

00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:04.835
The link this time needs to be adjusted to point to the Font Awesome file.

00:05:04.835 --> 00:05:10.320
So this is /cssfontawesome/css,

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:17.565
and then we need the all.min.css.

00:05:17.565 --> 00:05:20.805
Let's check if these icons are working, hit "Save",

00:05:20.805 --> 00:05:27.135
"Reload", and that's our icons down in the footer.

00:05:27.135 --> 00:05:30.945
It is also our Custom CSS file 2.

00:05:30.945 --> 00:05:33.635
Remember, as a requirements of WordPress,

00:05:33.635 --> 00:05:36.890
we needed to move this to a style.css file,

00:05:36.890 --> 00:05:40.405
and this is in the root of our project.

00:05:40.405 --> 00:05:44.105
Underneath here, let's copy and paste in a new line.

00:05:44.105 --> 00:05:46.975
This becomes B for our custom file.

00:05:46.975 --> 00:05:52.100
We also need to grab the home directory, which is get_template_directory_uri.

00:05:52.100 --> 00:05:56.345
This time, we don't need to add a file path since this is in the root.

00:05:56.345 --> 00:06:04.020
All we need to do is add the filename of style.css, save and reload.

00:06:04.020 --> 00:06:07.775
We can see some custom styles have now been applied.

00:06:07.775 --> 00:06:10.505
We don't have the images introduced yet,

00:06:10.505 --> 00:06:12.575
but we'll come back to this very soon.

00:06:12.575 --> 00:06:17.530
The final thing to add are our scripts for jQuery and Bootstrap.

00:06:17.530 --> 00:06:22.055
We can add our bootstrap-js file in a similar way to the styles.

00:06:22.055 --> 00:06:24.905
But this time, instead of wp_enqueue_style,

00:06:24.905 --> 00:06:28.880
we run wp_enqueue_script, so that are the same,

00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:31.555
just after our third style.

00:06:31.555 --> 00:06:36.059
The function name wp_enqueue,

00:06:36.059 --> 00:06:38.790
and this time this is script inside.

00:06:38.790 --> 00:06:41.025
Here, we first add our name,

00:06:41.025 --> 00:06:43.530
so this is going to be bootstrap-js.

00:06:43.530 --> 00:06:45.560
Again, this is the name of our choice,

00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:47.375
and it must be unique.

00:06:47.375 --> 00:06:51.930
Second of all, we're going to copy the file path from here.

00:06:51.950 --> 00:06:57.274
At the same, we also need to use this to point to the home directory,

00:06:57.274 --> 00:07:02.240
and then the file path which we're going to use is supposed to be /js,

00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:11.815
and then forward slash the name of our file, which is bootstrap.min.js.

00:07:11.815 --> 00:07:14.210
We can also add stuff to this,

00:07:14.210 --> 00:07:16.220
an array of dependencies.

00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.820
I'm going to add a dependency of jQuery.

00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:22.570
We can add multiple scripts into here,

00:07:22.570 --> 00:07:26.225
and jQuery is bundled with WordPress by default,

00:07:26.225 --> 00:07:30.050
so we don't need to add this as a script separated by a comma.

00:07:30.050 --> 00:07:33.035
Just after this, we can also add a fourth argument,

00:07:33.035 --> 00:07:36.460
which is if you want to use a specific version number,

00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:38.595
so I'm going to add this as a null,

00:07:38.595 --> 00:07:41.600
the fifth and final value is going to be true.

00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:44.270
Setting this value to true will declare that we

00:07:44.270 --> 00:07:47.090
want WordPress to add this script to the footer,

00:07:47.090 --> 00:07:49.385
You just need wp_footer tag,

00:07:49.385 --> 00:07:51.025
which we added earlier,

00:07:51.025 --> 00:07:53.530
and this is this one here.

00:07:53.870 --> 00:07:58.560
Finally, if we save this and then reload our theme.

00:07:58.560 --> 00:08:00.590
I also got a syntax errors,

00:08:00.590 --> 00:08:02.820
let's check this out,

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:08.125
and we could just missing a semicolon. You got to save.

00:08:08.125 --> 00:08:11.450
We can check the JavaScript is being loaded.

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:14.310
If we scroll down the browser,

00:08:14.870 --> 00:08:20.180
and we know the JavaScript is working because our dropdown is fully functional.

00:08:20.180 --> 00:08:23.660
If we now expand the browser a little bit bigger,

00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:26.725
and then we go to reload resource.

00:08:26.725 --> 00:08:29.765
First of all, let's go to the top of the file.

00:08:29.765 --> 00:08:32.840
If we look closely, we can see our Custom CSS.

00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:34.955
We can see our fontawesome,

00:08:34.955 --> 00:08:38.870
and also what we call bootstrap-css has been loaded.

00:08:38.870 --> 00:08:41.315
Then right down to the very bottom,

00:08:41.315 --> 00:08:42.920
we also have a script here,

00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:45.930
which is one of our bootstrap.min.js.

00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:51.950
You've now learned how to add stylesheets and scripts to WordPress the correct way.

00:08:51.950 --> 00:08:55.010
This allows WordPress to control what is loaded,

00:08:55.010 --> 00:08:58.260
and avoid any potential problems.
