00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.040
As a theme author,

00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:07.020
we also need to handle what to do when comments are not allowed on a post.

00:00:07.020 --> 00:00:12.240
If we go over to the dashboard and then go down to a post,

00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:16.815
click on "All," we can select any post which has comments,

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:20.690
we can see the number of comments inside of the speech bubble just here,

00:00:20.690 --> 00:00:24.385
so let's click on "Blog post six" and then "Edit."

00:00:24.385 --> 00:00:28.305
In the menu on the side bar down here we see a discussion section,

00:00:28.305 --> 00:00:33.045
if we click on this, this has the option to allow or disable comments.

00:00:33.045 --> 00:00:39.120
If we uncheck "Allow Comments," click on "Update," and then go

00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:45.605
to "View Post," we see that the existing comments are still showing.

00:00:45.605 --> 00:00:49.715
I will show you how to delete these in the next video but for now,

00:00:49.715 --> 00:00:55.090
a user may be confused since there is nothing telling them that comments are closed.

00:00:55.090 --> 00:00:59.720
We can now put some text in this case in the comments.php file,

00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:02.590
so let's head over there now in our text editor.

00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.675
Then if we locate this closing section tag,

00:01:05.675 --> 00:01:07.445
which is for the comments,

00:01:07.445 --> 00:01:10.205
we want to add a php if-statements,

00:01:10.205 --> 00:01:12.410
so open up the php tags.

00:01:12.410 --> 00:01:17.725
You can add a if-statements and then close this off just afterwards.

00:01:17.725 --> 00:01:20.900
We want to check if the comments are not open.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:24.350
We can do this by doing the reverse with a exclamation mark,

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:27.530
this will do the opposite of comments open,

00:01:27.530 --> 00:01:31.615
so this will only be true if the comments are closed,

00:01:31.615 --> 00:01:33.970
add comma just afterwards,

00:01:33.970 --> 00:01:36.425
which will run the code on the next line.

00:01:36.425 --> 00:01:38.135
If the condition is true,

00:01:38.135 --> 00:01:41.965
the code will output is a simple paragraph or text,

00:01:41.965 --> 00:01:44.240
we can add a p-elements inside here,

00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:46.190
which is just standard HTML,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:48.935
nested inside, we can open up the php,

00:01:48.935 --> 00:01:56.410
close this off and then we want to run a function called escape html_e.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:02:00.170
This is a function which will display

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.450
the translated text that's being escaped for safe use in HTML output,

00:02:05.450 --> 00:02:09.410
and the text that we want to add is simply "Comments are

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:16.430
closed for this post," add a semicolon just afterwards.

00:02:16.430 --> 00:02:19.410
Now, let's head over to the browser and then reload,

00:02:19.410 --> 00:02:25.845
we've close a syntax error and we just want to close off our if-section.

00:02:25.845 --> 00:02:30.290
So php and our if-section,

00:02:30.290 --> 00:02:36.410
then close this off, hit "Save" and then refresh, and there we go.

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:39.200
It says [inaudible] text at the bottom of "Comments are closed for this

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:44.195
post," and we can confirm that we don't see this text if you go to a different blog post.

00:02:44.195 --> 00:02:46.119
Let's go back to five,

00:02:46.119 --> 00:02:47.850
we don't see the text,

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:53.195
four, number three, and we have all comments open,

00:02:53.195 --> 00:02:55.715
so we don't see the text at the bottom.

00:02:55.715 --> 00:02:58.280
So this is only a small change,

00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:02.600
but this is a nice touch which can help the user experience and stop them

00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:07.930
getting confused why they don't see a comment form showing on the post.
