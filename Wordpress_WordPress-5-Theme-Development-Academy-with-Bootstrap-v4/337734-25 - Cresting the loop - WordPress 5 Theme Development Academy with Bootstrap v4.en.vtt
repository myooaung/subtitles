00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280
We're now going to move on to taking a look at the famous WordPress loop,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.110
and how we can use it to loop through all of

00:00:07.110 --> 00:00:09.945
our blog posts and display them on the screen.

00:00:09.945 --> 00:00:14.760
I've just hand it over to the WordPress developer sites and then in the loop section,

00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:19.275
which can give us a bit more information about what the loop is and what it can do.

00:00:19.275 --> 00:00:24.360
But I've highlighted probably one of the most important and simple sections here,

00:00:24.360 --> 00:00:27.135
which basically says the loop will loop through

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:30.945
each post retrieved for the current page one at a time,

00:00:30.945 --> 00:00:35.005
and then we can perform an action for each post that will retrieve.

00:00:35.005 --> 00:00:37.640
So basically what we're going to do is loop through

00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:41.195
every post which has been created in WordPress,

00:00:41.195 --> 00:00:44.900
and then we can structure our blog post in any way which we

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:49.210
like using HTML and also some WordPress functions.

00:00:49.210 --> 00:00:53.540
If we scroll down, we can see how the loop looks in PHP.

00:00:53.540 --> 00:00:57.445
So this may look a little bit strange if you've not used to PHP.

00:00:57.445 --> 00:01:00.140
First, if you take out the PHP tags,

00:01:00.140 --> 00:01:02.630
which is quite a lot of them as we go in and out to

00:01:02.630 --> 00:01:07.465
the code and then take a step back and saw Redis as it was English.

00:01:07.465 --> 00:01:12.680
We're basically saying if posted available by having posts,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.810
we're then going to use a loop,

00:01:14.810 --> 00:01:17.540
which is called a while loop and then we're going to loop through

00:01:17.540 --> 00:01:21.470
all these posts and then grab the contents of each post.

00:01:21.470 --> 00:01:24.590
This means the inner side of this while loop section.

00:01:24.590 --> 00:01:27.695
We then have access to all the available post content,

00:01:27.695 --> 00:01:29.150
such as the title,

00:01:29.150 --> 00:01:34.540
the body section, any tags or categories or anything else which we create.

00:01:34.540 --> 00:01:37.040
Then after this, all we're doing is just closing of

00:01:37.040 --> 00:01:40.655
the loop and then closing off the if section from above.

00:01:40.655 --> 00:01:43.210
Let's go ahead and create this now.

00:01:43.210 --> 00:01:46.095
At the moment in our blog to HTML.

00:01:46.095 --> 00:01:51.360
This is all just static content and this is fine for a normal HTML websites.

00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:57.085
If we want WordPress to have control over how these blog posts will display on the page.

00:01:57.085 --> 00:02:00.455
So we're going to create the loop and then we'll create the structure

00:02:00.455 --> 00:02:03.725
for our WordPress passing things such as the title,

00:02:03.725 --> 00:02:05.630
the date, and the description.

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:11.140
As I mentioned earlier, we are going to be creating our blog posts in the index.php.

00:02:11.140 --> 00:02:14.525
We can write the loop between the header and the footer.

00:02:14.525 --> 00:02:18.085
Let's begin by opening up the PHP tags.

00:02:18.085 --> 00:02:23.790
Then we're going to create our if statement to check if any posts exists.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:26.870
Have underscore posts.

00:02:26.870 --> 00:02:29.425
This is a WordPress function,

00:02:29.425 --> 00:02:31.750
then a colon just afterwards.

00:02:31.750 --> 00:02:36.415
This colon is a shorthand or an alternative syntax for PHP,

00:02:36.415 --> 00:02:41.045
which means we can add our content just afterwards if this condition is true.

00:02:41.045 --> 00:02:44.995
Then I'm going to close this off with an endif and a semicolon,

00:02:44.995 --> 00:02:46.915
close off the PHP at the end.

00:02:46.915 --> 00:02:49.960
So if you do have post available, what do you want to do?

00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.130
We want to create our while loop to loop through posts while they are available.

00:02:55.130 --> 00:02:59.040
So we can use the same function where we have posts.

00:02:59.040 --> 00:03:01.510
But I'm going to loop through each one.

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:04.000
Again use a colon, and then we declare after

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.250
this what we want to do while posted available.

00:03:07.250 --> 00:03:12.185
When posted available, we want to use the WordPress function, the underscore post,

00:03:12.185 --> 00:03:15.125
which we'll call the data from the next post in line,

00:03:15.125 --> 00:03:18.500
which we are looping over and a semicolon at the end,

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.790
and then we can close off our while loop with endwhile.

00:03:22.790 --> 00:03:27.490
This will break out of the loop once we finish looping over all of the posts,

00:03:27.490 --> 00:03:29.310
semicolon at the end.

00:03:29.310 --> 00:03:31.410
So now inside of this while section,

00:03:31.410 --> 00:03:33.330
we have the post information.

00:03:33.330 --> 00:03:37.960
We can go ahead and create our HTML to create our blog posts.

00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.160
If we go ahead and add a HTML element such as a dif,

00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.440
just like this, we can see that the text editor has

00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.090
highlighted this white since this is not valid syntax.

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.850
This is because we are creating a PHP section with the opening and

00:03:52.850 --> 00:03:58.415
closing tags and therefore the text editor expects all content to be PHP.

00:03:58.415 --> 00:04:01.775
But since we now transfer it over to HTML,

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:04.300
we need to now close off our PHP.

00:04:04.300 --> 00:04:06.945
To make this more readable,

00:04:06.945 --> 00:04:09.915
we can put this all on its same line.

00:04:09.915 --> 00:04:11.540
Then after this HTML,

00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:13.700
we're jumping back into PHP.

00:04:13.700 --> 00:04:15.985
So we need to once again open this up.

00:04:15.985 --> 00:04:20.615
We can also put this on to the same line so it's more readable.

00:04:20.615 --> 00:04:23.840
Now the PHP all has the opening and closing tags,

00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:27.010
we are free now to add the HTML where we need to.

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:30.755
Now we have our section where we can create our blog post structure.

00:04:30.755 --> 00:04:34.660
I'm not going to use a PHP function called the content.

00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.030
Open up the PHP tags,

00:04:37.030 --> 00:04:41.630
close this off and the WordPress function called the underscore content.

00:04:41.630 --> 00:04:44.720
This is used to filter the content of the blog post

00:04:44.720 --> 00:04:48.020
from the database and then it render it to the screen.

00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:52.160
We'll come back to this very soon and add more content to our blog post.

00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.860
But for now I'm going to add else section.

00:04:54.860 --> 00:04:59.975
We're saying here, if we have posts and we're going to construct our blog post inside.

00:04:59.975 --> 00:05:04.710
If not, we can add else section, the colon.

00:05:04.710 --> 00:05:06.815
So if no posted available,

00:05:06.815 --> 00:05:09.354
let's create some HTML,

00:05:09.354 --> 00:05:13.275
the p elements, and then a text of sorry,

00:05:13.275 --> 00:05:16.540
no post match our criteria.

00:05:21.350 --> 00:05:24.680
We can see straight away that this is highlighted white

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:27.875
since we need close off our PHP just above.

00:05:27.875 --> 00:05:32.230
We can then started off once more after this.

00:05:32.230 --> 00:05:36.395
Then we're going to wrap our text in a echo function.

00:05:36.395 --> 00:05:43.385
So PHP underscore e to display this to the browser.

00:05:43.385 --> 00:05:47.215
Then as a string, we can paste in our text ones more,

00:05:47.215 --> 00:05:51.795
add a semicolon, close off the PHP,

00:05:51.795 --> 00:05:54.415
and now everything is, as it should be.

00:05:54.415 --> 00:06:00.455
Using this underscore e function allows our text to be translated later on in a theme,

00:06:00.455 --> 00:06:03.275
which is a pretty essential parts of any theme,

00:06:03.275 --> 00:06:07.900
unless you plan to own uses theme for yourself in one particular language.

00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:11.165
So this can look pretty confusing if you're new to all this.

00:06:11.165 --> 00:06:14.285
But just to recap, we are checking if post are available.

00:06:14.285 --> 00:06:17.300
If they are, we're looping through with a PHP while

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:20.960
loop and each poster defines inside of WordPress,

00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:26.815
we're going to display the content of the post with enclosing off the loop.

00:06:26.815 --> 00:06:31.345
Then no more code underneath for the run is this post are available.

00:06:31.345 --> 00:06:33.920
However, if these posts are not available,

00:06:33.920 --> 00:06:38.105
the section just after else will run and then we'll get a message saying,

00:06:38.105 --> 00:06:40.900
"Sorry, no post match your criteria.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.170
We will come back to this later on where we construct the rest of our blog post.

00:06:45.170 --> 00:06:48.950
So they should look a little bit more clear in a future video.

00:06:48.950 --> 00:06:52.355
This index is now our default blog page.

00:06:52.355 --> 00:06:55.220
If no more specific template can be found.

00:06:55.220 --> 00:06:59.390
We also need to do the same now for the page template too,

00:06:59.390 --> 00:07:03.580
which is going to be a default page if no other page can be found.

00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:06.510
Let's select all, copy this,

00:07:06.510 --> 00:07:08.580
and we can use this as our base.

00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.635
Inside of our sidebar,

00:07:10.635 --> 00:07:16.440
we create the page dot PHP templates, paste this in.

00:07:16.440 --> 00:07:19.100
Since this is the default page templates,

00:07:19.100 --> 00:07:20.480
no for blog posts,

00:07:20.480 --> 00:07:24.715
we can say no pages match your criteria.

00:07:24.715 --> 00:07:27.915
Finally, the template comments at the top.

00:07:27.915 --> 00:07:37.215
This is going to be the template for displaying all single post.

00:07:37.215 --> 00:07:40.340
So this is it now for our loop basics,

00:07:40.340 --> 00:07:42.095
but we will continue with this in

00:07:42.095 --> 00:07:46.530
the upcoming videos to construct the rest of our blog posts.
