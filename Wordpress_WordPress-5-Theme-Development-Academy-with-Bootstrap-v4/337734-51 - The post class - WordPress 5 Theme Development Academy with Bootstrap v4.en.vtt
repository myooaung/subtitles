00:00:00.050 --> 00:00:04.620
This video is going to look at using the post class function,

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.345
which we can find on Google by searching for the WordPress post class.

00:00:09.345 --> 00:00:16.695
This is the reference we need from the codex.wordpress.org, let's select this.

00:00:16.695 --> 00:00:19.770
These post class function is typically added to

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:22.815
the WordPress loop when displaying blog posts,

00:00:22.815 --> 00:00:25.965
but not completely limited to this use.

00:00:25.965 --> 00:00:32.505
It gives us the option to set styling for a specific post or a certain group of posts.

00:00:32.505 --> 00:00:35.470
If we scroll down to the usage section,

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:38.855
we can set up our blog posts to have additional classes

00:00:38.855 --> 00:00:42.800
based on various things such as the post type,

00:00:42.800 --> 00:00:45.850
a category, all the tags.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:50.300
For example, we can set this up for our blog posts with the tag of news,

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.055
then each one of these posts will get a CSS class of tag-news.

00:00:55.055 --> 00:00:59.695
We can then add style into this class as usual in our CSS file.

00:00:59.695 --> 00:01:03.485
If we had OSU or index.php file,

00:01:03.485 --> 00:01:06.875
inside of our loop where we have the post section,

00:01:06.875 --> 00:01:10.085
we have area surrounding div for each blog post.

00:01:10.085 --> 00:01:12.980
This is where we're going to add the post class function.

00:01:12.980 --> 00:01:16.170
We do this in the opening tag inside of

00:01:16.170 --> 00:01:21.335
a PHP tag and this function is going to be called the post class.

00:01:21.335 --> 00:01:26.120
Notice we currently have no over classes added to this div.

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.635
If we save this file however and then go over to the developer tools,

00:01:30.635 --> 00:01:35.860
so click on the blog, right-click and then inspect.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:39.435
That's like the first blog post.

00:01:39.435 --> 00:01:41.810
Just inside of our container,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:43.505
which is called sm-8,

00:01:43.505 --> 00:01:46.570
we have eight surrounding div for all posts.

00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:51.830
Inside of our code, we don't have any classes inside the here and now this post classes,

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:57.005
I did all this extra information such as the blog post number of 18,

00:01:57.005 --> 00:02:03.410
the type of post, the published status and also that the category is uncategorized.

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:09.510
Let's scroll down and select a different one which is blog post five.

00:02:09.510 --> 00:02:12.920
We can see this now has the class of category news

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.370
and also the tag of offers and each one of

00:02:16.370 --> 00:02:18.620
our blog post is different depending on

00:02:18.620 --> 00:02:23.225
the post ID and also any tags and categories we've included.

00:02:23.225 --> 00:02:26.420
Inside of the brackets for the post class,

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:30.715
we can also add in a custom class with any name of our choosing.

00:02:30.715 --> 00:02:35.685
We just add custom class inside here, say this.

00:02:35.685 --> 00:02:38.970
Now, if we go back over to the developer tools,

00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:42.290
our custom class is now added.

00:02:42.290 --> 00:02:44.810
This can also be used to pass in an array of

00:02:44.810 --> 00:02:48.220
values so we can include multiple classes too.

00:02:48.220 --> 00:02:50.440
Having all of these custom classes,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.110
now allows us to go over to the style.css and

00:02:54.110 --> 00:02:57.920
add any custom styling we want to add for example,

00:02:57.920 --> 00:03:00.175
if we had a tag of offers,

00:03:00.175 --> 00:03:03.050
if it's like tag offers and add

00:03:03.050 --> 00:03:06.845
some custom CSS which is only going to apply to this group.

00:03:06.845 --> 00:03:08.990
For example, to see this in action,

00:03:08.990 --> 00:03:17.510
we could add a hover states and that's setup a transform to scale

00:03:17.510 --> 00:03:27.155
is to a value of 1.01 and also change the background to RGB value 241,

00:03:27.155 --> 00:03:31.455
the green is 245 and then 241.

00:03:31.455 --> 00:03:34.769
Now, back over to the browser and reload,

00:03:34.769 --> 00:03:38.870
we can see this one has a tag of offers and if now hover over this,

00:03:38.870 --> 00:03:42.685
we are different background color and also the transform.

00:03:42.685 --> 00:03:49.770
Let's go down on blog posts four doesn't have this class nor does three or two or one.

00:03:49.770 --> 00:03:53.580
This is only applying to our one specific blog post.

00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:56.974
We have fine control over the CSS.

00:03:56.974 --> 00:04:02.600
This is targeting a specific post or setup posts using the post class function,

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:07.500
which gives us fine control over the styling of our blog posts.
