00:00:00.590 --> 00:00:04.305
In the last section when we created this blog page,

00:00:04.305 --> 00:00:09.600
we also added a permanent function to allow this to link to the full blog post page.

00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:11.040
When I click on the Title,

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:14.295
we're taken to a single post view,

00:00:14.295 --> 00:00:16.500
to see more details about the post.

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:20.730
At the moment though, we still see the shortened version of the blog post,

00:00:20.730 --> 00:00:22.725
all the excerpt as it's called,

00:00:22.725 --> 00:00:25.890
and we can also see the read more text at the bottom,

00:00:25.890 --> 00:00:27.915
which we also need to remove.

00:00:27.915 --> 00:00:33.240
This is because the theme will default back to the index.php file,

00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.075
if the most specific file cannot be found.

00:00:36.075 --> 00:00:43.105
In this video, I now want to create a new page template Tranquil called the single.php,

00:00:43.105 --> 00:00:45.410
and this is a file which is recognized by

00:00:45.410 --> 00:00:50.240
WordPress as the template to display a single blog post.

00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.700
Let's go over to our text editor in the root of the project.

00:00:55.700 --> 00:01:00.445
Click "New File". This is the single.php.

00:01:00.445 --> 00:01:03.815
We can begin as ever with our comments at the top.

00:01:03.815 --> 00:01:06.335
Open or close the php tags,

00:01:06.335 --> 00:01:09.320
and then we add a comment with the forward slash,

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.825
and then the stars close off.

00:01:12.825 --> 00:01:18.690
It's actually going to be the template for displaying all blog posts.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.465
Since this file will share a lot of similarities with the index.php,

00:01:26.465 --> 00:01:30.350
I'm going to go over there and copy the content to begin with.

00:01:30.350 --> 00:01:33.020
Down at the bottom from the footer,

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:36.370
we copy everything up to the header.

00:01:36.370 --> 00:01:42.035
Take this over, and add this just under our commands in a single.php.

00:01:42.035 --> 00:01:45.145
Let's begin up at the top of this file.

00:01:45.145 --> 00:01:49.925
The title, we just want to display the title at the top of the blog post.

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:53.960
We don't need this to link to the full post since we already there.

00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:57.300
We can remove the link surrounding this.

00:01:57.710 --> 00:02:04.185
Remove this, we should leave now on our single.php.

00:02:04.185 --> 00:02:08.410
If we reload, we should now see that we can't click on this page title,

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.140
meaning the single file which we created is now taking effect.

00:02:12.140 --> 00:02:14.755
The next thing to do is to make these texts on here,

00:02:14.755 --> 00:02:17.655
the full content rather than the excerpt.

00:02:17.655 --> 00:02:20.110
If we scroll down to the excerpt,

00:02:20.110 --> 00:02:22.180
which is this function just here,

00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:26.750
all we need to do is simply change it back to be the content,

00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:32.655
and this is now the full version of our blog post contents.

00:02:32.655 --> 00:02:34.930
We only have the one paragraph for the moment.

00:02:34.930 --> 00:02:37.885
We can see this is the full content that we have.

00:02:37.885 --> 00:02:40.730
The next step is to remove this read more text.

00:02:40.730 --> 00:02:46.515
Since we already have the full blog post, over to single.php,

00:02:46.515 --> 00:02:49.400
if we take look for this read more text here,

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.890
I'm going to remove the full link or the full div surrounding this.

00:02:53.890 --> 00:02:56.630
We don't need any of this anymore.

00:02:56.630 --> 00:03:01.350
Say this and the text is now disappeared.

00:03:01.350 --> 00:03:03.935
Let's just confirm this is all working okay,

00:03:03.935 --> 00:03:05.740
if we go back to our blog,

00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:08.010
we still see the shortened version.

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:11.815
We still see the link for the title and the read more text.

00:03:11.815 --> 00:03:14.275
Back to our single.php.

00:03:14.275 --> 00:03:16.450
To wrap up this video, if you notice,

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:19.955
up at the top, we have the default VG text.

00:03:19.955 --> 00:03:23.580
This is because over in the functions.php ,

00:03:23.580 --> 00:03:26.445
we created the else section as a fullback,

00:03:26.445 --> 00:03:29.625
if no more specific page is found in the both.

00:03:29.625 --> 00:03:32.910
So the default back to the text which we see here.

00:03:32.910 --> 00:03:34.980
However, we want the text of

00:03:34.980 --> 00:03:39.510
Tranquil Spa Official Blog since we are still within the blog section.

00:03:39.510 --> 00:03:46.010
We can add a operator inside of this else if section to check if the page is home,

00:03:46.010 --> 00:03:53.050
or we can use the two pipes to check if this is if home or is on single,

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:56.220
which will point to the single.php templates.

00:03:56.220 --> 00:04:01.915
Now, over to the single file and our text is now displaying as the official blog.

00:04:01.915 --> 00:04:04.115
We will return to this single post in

00:04:04.115 --> 00:04:08.580
the next video and we'll show you how to include pagination.
