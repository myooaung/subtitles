00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:05.400
Displaying this sidebar on the page is now a step in the right direction.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:10.095
At the moment we just have the dummy data which were added into our theme.

00:00:10.095 --> 00:00:13.440
This is what we're going to focus on in this video.

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:15.915
First of all, the above block at the top,

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.165
is just some basic plain text.

00:00:18.165 --> 00:00:20.280
We can leave this as it is.

00:00:20.280 --> 00:00:24.810
After this, we have our dynamic sections of archives and categories,

00:00:24.810 --> 00:00:28.950
and we can work with these over in the sidebar.php.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:32.340
This is the top block with the text.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.235
The second one is the archives.

00:00:35.235 --> 00:00:37.625
What we need to do, we need to remove

00:00:37.625 --> 00:00:41.585
our free list items which we have inside the ordered lists,

00:00:41.585 --> 00:00:47.610
and then in place of this we can add a WordPress function called wp_get_archives.

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:57.740
Brackets, and then semicolon at the end.

00:00:57.740 --> 00:01:00.080
Let's check this work in the browser.

00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:05.450
Reload. Good, I've only created these blog posts in one month.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.600
We only see the one month appear in the archives.

00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:10.465
We can click on this,

00:01:10.465 --> 00:01:13.685
we see the date is being populated in the URL,

00:01:13.685 --> 00:01:17.820
and also the plug posts which we created in this month.

00:01:17.820 --> 00:01:21.235
Now let's move on to the categories just below.

00:01:21.235 --> 00:01:23.815
We can do a very similar thing by removing

00:01:23.815 --> 00:01:28.970
our two list items and then replacing this with a WordPress function.

00:01:28.970 --> 00:01:32.980
This WordPress function this time is called wp.

00:01:32.980 --> 00:01:37.720
These categories, check this out.

00:01:37.720 --> 00:01:40.715
You have multiple categories, so Refresh.

00:01:40.715 --> 00:01:46.600
We have the news, offers and also a section for any uncategorized blog-posts.

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.530
By default, we also have a category's title at the top.

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.455
However, we already have this as a heading.

00:01:53.455 --> 00:01:58.930
We can remove this, if we go back to the WordPress function of list categories.

00:01:58.930 --> 00:02:00.870
Inside here as a string,

00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:03.004
we can set the title.

00:02:03.004 --> 00:02:08.360
So title_li. I'm going to could just set this to be equal to nothing.

00:02:08.360 --> 00:02:13.540
Save this, Reload and the title has been unset.

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:17.600
If you also want to check out the WordPress function reference,

00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.755
you will find many other arguments too if required.

00:02:20.755 --> 00:02:24.015
Such as the ability to sort of categories,

00:02:24.015 --> 00:02:29.435
add any additional styling and also add a separator between each category.

00:02:29.435 --> 00:02:31.880
I'm just going to leave this for now since we've already

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:34.265
added the styling using Bootstrap.

00:02:34.265 --> 00:02:36.410
We can now click on "Category",

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.315
let's go for News.

00:02:38.315 --> 00:02:43.384
We'll see how a free blog post here, offers.

00:02:43.384 --> 00:02:46.610
We only have two which is tagged with offers,

00:02:46.610 --> 00:02:49.985
and then any which don't fall into a category.

00:02:49.985 --> 00:02:54.685
The final thing we have in our sidebar is our social media icons.

00:02:54.685 --> 00:02:57.815
According to your own social media pages here.

00:02:57.815 --> 00:03:00.140
I'm just going to add one as an example,

00:03:00.140 --> 00:03:02.195
so let's go for Twitter.

00:03:02.195 --> 00:03:06.755
You can add the link with HTML elements.

00:03:06.755 --> 00:03:09.110
We can find the link location

00:03:09.110 --> 00:03:10.629
with the href:

00:03:10.629 --> 00:03:20.575
https://twitter.com/chrisdixon161.

00:03:20.575 --> 00:03:25.215
Close this off. Then just after our i elements,

00:03:25.215 --> 00:03:27.090
we can close up our link,

00:03:27.090 --> 00:03:28.845
and then indent this.

00:03:28.845 --> 00:03:31.160
I'm going to now leave the rest to you if you want to go

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:34.250
ahead and add any more social media links.

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:38.460
Once you're done with this, I will then see you in the next video.
