00:00:04.490 --> 00:00:09.660
Welcome to the WordPress Theme Development Academy using Bootstrap.

00:00:09.660 --> 00:00:13.710
This is a fully updated WordPress theme development course

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:18.460
using WordPress version 5 and the bootstrap 4 framework.

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.860
If you want take your WordPress skills to the next level,

00:00:21.860 --> 00:00:24.965
learning theme development is perfect for this.

00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:26.790
It will allow you to build

00:00:26.790 --> 00:00:32.510
custom WordPress websites that look and feel exactly how you want them to.

00:00:32.510 --> 00:00:37.490
It will also give you an advantage over other WordPress developers using

00:00:37.490 --> 00:00:40.145
the prebuilt themes and trying to

00:00:40.145 --> 00:00:44.310
customize them based exactly what they are trying to build.

00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:48.665
This is what you'll be able to build by the end of this course.

00:00:48.665 --> 00:00:50.390
By the end of this, you'll be able to build

00:00:50.390 --> 00:00:53.690
almost any type of new website which you want using

00:00:53.690 --> 00:01:00.060
WordPress or take any existing website and convert it to a WordPress theme.

00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:03.460
What exactly is a WordPress theme?

00:01:03.460 --> 00:01:05.750
To see what WordPress can do,

00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.185
let's take a look at some examples.

00:01:08.185 --> 00:01:11.780
This is the blog page for the theme we're going to build together.

00:01:11.780 --> 00:01:13.610
We have the header at the top;

00:01:13.610 --> 00:01:16.209
linking to the home and blog pages,

00:01:16.209 --> 00:01:18.665
a subtitle, a header image,

00:01:18.665 --> 00:01:20.600
and a text overlay.

00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:26.920
Then below us we have the blog post listed on the left and then the sidebar on the right.

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:32.435
Next, using the exact same version of Wordpress and the exact same content,

00:01:32.435 --> 00:01:36.875
all I have done here is switch to a different theme at the click of a button.

00:01:36.875 --> 00:01:42.185
This has the same blog post and we can also see the page links are the same,

00:01:42.185 --> 00:01:45.280
but a completely different look and feel.

00:01:45.280 --> 00:01:47.370
Again switching the theme once more,

00:01:47.370 --> 00:01:50.780
this is how we'll look using another prebuilt theme.

00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:56.525
This completely changes our blog page and all the other pages on our site.

00:01:56.525 --> 00:01:59.390
Also the same for this example two,

00:01:59.390 --> 00:02:02.710
completely changing the field of our Wordpress sites.

00:02:02.710 --> 00:02:07.295
In this course, we won't just be doing the bare minimum WordPress theme,

00:02:07.295 --> 00:02:14.585
we will begin by creating a static HTML and CSS version of this theme using Bootstrap 4.

00:02:14.585 --> 00:02:18.370
Learning Bootstrap is also a valuable skill in itself,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:22.070
but then we move on to setting up WordPress and looking

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:26.230
at exactly what is needed to convert this site to a theme.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:28.580
We cover all the steps including some of

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:34.790
the more advanced and challenging concepts such as custom fields, theme translation,

00:02:34.790 --> 00:02:37.810
custom search forms, using hooks,

00:02:37.810 --> 00:02:44.170
and also some custom functions to get the exact functionality which we want.

00:02:44.170 --> 00:02:47.570
If you want to get serious about WordPress theme development,

00:02:47.570 --> 00:02:51.270
enroll in this course and I will see you in class.
