00:00:00.260 --> 00:00:04.035
In our header section, our menu links up at the top.

00:00:04.035 --> 00:00:05.655
If we click on the Home,

00:00:05.655 --> 00:00:08.985
this links to our HTML versions of our index page,

00:00:08.985 --> 00:00:11.010
and also if we click on the Blog,

00:00:11.010 --> 00:00:13.830
this also goes to our blog to HTML.

00:00:13.830 --> 00:00:17.205
This is not what we want however for a WordPress theme,

00:00:17.205 --> 00:00:21.000
since we want WordPress to control the pages and also the navigation.

00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.605
Let's kick things off by creating a new WordPress menu in the dashboard.

00:00:25.605 --> 00:00:31.485
So let's head over to the main dashboard and then go to Appearance and then Customize.

00:00:31.485 --> 00:00:36.370
From here we can go over to the customizer and add a new menu.

00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:42.255
As you guessed, we can do this in the Menus tab and then create a new menu.

00:00:42.255 --> 00:00:45.980
This is our first look at what is called the customizer.

00:00:45.980 --> 00:00:50.285
This allows us to visually make changes to certain parts of our theme,

00:00:50.285 --> 00:00:54.980
and we can also see a preview over on the right-hand side of our changes.

00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.770
So we can play around with these settings and

00:00:57.770 --> 00:01:01.090
see how it looks in our theme before committing.

00:01:01.090 --> 00:01:05.495
We'll be using the customizer to add this new menu to our theme.

00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:09.140
Then add a menu name of main menu,

00:01:09.140 --> 00:01:15.125
click on "Next", add items to other pages which we want to add to our menu.

00:01:15.125 --> 00:01:17.500
The first one is going to be for home,

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:19.940
and then we don't have a blog page just yet.

00:01:19.940 --> 00:01:22.120
So we can add the just below.

00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.990
Click on "Add", and make sure we have the home and blog links on the left-hand side.

00:01:26.990 --> 00:01:30.245
If we wanted to we could also add custom links.

00:01:30.245 --> 00:01:33.440
We could also add links to various posts and

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:37.240
the categories or tags associated with those posts too,

00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.430
but for now these two pages are all we need to reflect our bootstrap templates.

00:01:42.430 --> 00:01:45.350
We can also add pages automatically to

00:01:45.350 --> 00:01:48.695
our menu as they are created by clicking this button here.

00:01:48.695 --> 00:01:50.840
But we just want the two for now.

00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:53.135
So click on "Publish",

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:58.725
close this down, and we can go and refresh our page.

00:01:58.725 --> 00:02:03.890
So the menu is created but we don't have it appearing in our theme just yet.

00:02:03.890 --> 00:02:06.425
This is the links from our HTML.

00:02:06.425 --> 00:02:09.970
Just forward do this we're going to go over to the WordPress codex,

00:02:09.970 --> 00:02:13.870
which is available at developer.wordpress.org.

00:02:13.870 --> 00:02:16.055
So head over to this page.

00:02:16.055 --> 00:02:19.645
Then we can do a search for wp_nav_menu,

00:02:19.645 --> 00:02:22.050
separated by underscores.

00:02:22.050 --> 00:02:24.370
So wp_nav_menu.

00:02:24.370 --> 00:02:29.380
Search for this, then go over to the function reference.

00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:33.245
We see at the top wp_nav_menu is used to display

00:02:33.245 --> 00:02:36.970
a navigation menu and this is exactly what we need.

00:02:36.970 --> 00:02:41.225
Below this we have some parameters which we can add into our menu.

00:02:41.225 --> 00:02:45.290
These parameters will allow us to customize the menu by adding things such as

00:02:45.290 --> 00:02:50.020
containers along with various customer classes and IDs.

00:02:50.020 --> 00:02:53.374
Using all these parameters will allow us to tell WordPress

00:02:53.374 --> 00:02:56.900
exactly which classes we want to add it to our menu,

00:02:56.900 --> 00:03:00.995
to keep our styling and layout exactly how he is using Bootstrap.

00:03:00.995 --> 00:03:05.465
I'm going to do this by using what is called a Bootstrap navwalker.

00:03:05.465 --> 00:03:11.420
Let's go over to the tab and in search for the Bootstrap for navwalker,

00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:15.030
which would take us to the GitHub page.

00:03:15.830 --> 00:03:20.360
This navwalker will allow us to link all the Bootstrap classes and

00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.440
IDs and the basic structure to our WordPress menu.

00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:27.610
So we don't have any differences in the styling.

00:03:27.610 --> 00:03:31.205
The first thing we need to do is download the zip file.

00:03:31.205 --> 00:03:33.830
Let's click on "Clone or download".

00:03:33.830 --> 00:03:36.190
Download the zip file.

00:03:36.190 --> 00:03:42.570
I want it to download we need to add this to the root of our project.

00:03:42.570 --> 00:03:45.650
So open this up, then inside here you have a class

00:03:45.650 --> 00:03:49.870
which is called class-wp-bootstrapnavwalker.php.

00:03:49.870 --> 00:03:55.310
So let's copy this or in fact I'm going to drag this over into the sidebar.

00:03:55.310 --> 00:04:00.550
This will place this inside of our theme folder in the root of the project.

00:04:00.550 --> 00:04:04.160
If we go back over to the GitHub page for the navwalker,

00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:06.750
scroll down to the installation.

00:04:06.750 --> 00:04:09.160
We have already completed the first step,

00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.315
which is to place our PHP file into our folder.

00:04:13.315 --> 00:04:15.595
The next thing we need to do is to go off to the

00:04:15.595 --> 00:04:19.285
functions.php and add the following code.

00:04:19.285 --> 00:04:22.480
So I'm going to copy this over to the functions

00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:27.840
file and then scroll

00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.635
up and I'm going to add this just after our theme support for the title tag,

00:04:32.635 --> 00:04:35.915
paste this in, and we're good to go.

00:04:35.915 --> 00:04:40.885
So require once which is on the start of this line is a PHP function,

00:04:40.885 --> 00:04:43.480
which will include the file we specify.

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:46.990
In our case, we're pointing it to the main home directory,

00:04:46.990 --> 00:04:50.375
and then into the PHP file which we added.

00:04:50.375 --> 00:04:54.625
Require once is similar to the PHP require function.

00:04:54.625 --> 00:04:57.010
We will first check if this file has already been

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:00.250
included in the past before requiring it once more.

00:05:00.250 --> 00:05:02.830
With this now registered let's go back over to

00:05:02.830 --> 00:05:05.850
the documentation and the next step is to use

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:09.390
a WordPress function called register_nav_menus.

00:05:09.390 --> 00:05:12.300
So we can copy this function just here.

00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:15.550
This also needs to go over to our functions file,

00:05:15.550 --> 00:05:19.615
and I want to add this just on the line below. Paste this in.

00:05:19.615 --> 00:05:22.825
There is also a function to create a single menu

00:05:22.825 --> 00:05:26.980
called register_nav_menu rather than menus.

00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.310
But we'll also be adding a footer menu at a later date.

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.410
So we can stick with menus.

00:05:32.410 --> 00:05:34.945
This contains an array of menus.

00:05:34.945 --> 00:05:37.250
If no just have the one at the moments.

00:05:37.250 --> 00:05:42.924
Here we are adding in our menu as primary and we'll take a look at this in just a moment.

00:05:42.924 --> 00:05:45.610
After this, we'll have a menu description.

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:48.980
Once we come to description, the main header menu.

00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:53.745
After this we have the theme name. I'll just tranquilwp.

00:05:53.745 --> 00:05:58.735
This name must match the comments at the top of the style.css.

00:05:58.735 --> 00:06:00.520
It must much this text domain,

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.360
which we declared earlier.

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.590
Back in the functions,

00:06:04.590 --> 00:06:06.910
this text domain will also be used later on

00:06:06.910 --> 00:06:10.565
to when we look at translating our text in the theme.

00:06:10.565 --> 00:06:15.190
Now let's go back over to the documentation and continue with this menu.

00:06:15.190 --> 00:06:17.470
If we scroll down to the usage,

00:06:17.470 --> 00:06:20.965
the next piece of code is wp_nav_menu.

00:06:20.965 --> 00:06:24.415
This is what we looked at in the WordPress codex just before.

00:06:24.415 --> 00:06:28.850
This will be used in wp_nav_menu to register our menu,

00:06:28.850 --> 00:06:34.135
which we can then go ahead and map our WordPress classes with the bootstrap equivalence.

00:06:34.135 --> 00:06:38.000
Let's copy this function just here over to our header,

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.390
which is where our menu is stored.

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:43.210
Our menu to navigate to the unordered list.

00:06:43.210 --> 00:06:46.445
We can have a delete this or comment this section out.

00:06:46.445 --> 00:06:49.460
Since we're not using this hard-coded version anymore.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.475
In place it is we're going to add some PHP tags,

00:06:52.475 --> 00:06:55.270
since we're now jumping into PHP code,

00:06:55.270 --> 00:06:58.120
and then paste in our menu.

00:07:00.410 --> 00:07:05.225
Notice the list of parameters on the left-hand side of this array.

00:07:05.225 --> 00:07:07.640
These are the parameters we seen before when we looked

00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:11.375
at wp_nav_menu inside the WordPress website.

00:07:11.375 --> 00:07:13.510
These are all the ones just on here.

00:07:13.510 --> 00:07:16.130
We then have the option over on the right-hand side to

00:07:16.130 --> 00:07:18.980
map any of these to our Bootstrap equivalence.

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:23.905
So the Bootstrap classes will take effect rather than the WordPress defaults.

00:07:23.905 --> 00:07:28.550
If we begin by saving this and then reloading our homepage,

00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:32.465
we see our menu has now disappeared since we commented it out.

00:07:32.465 --> 00:07:35.320
We'll go over to add a menu,

00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:39.560
but I need taken to our main menu which we created before.

00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:44.740
We now need to set this main menu to our theme location of main header menu.

00:07:44.740 --> 00:07:47.250
So select this, save

00:07:47.250 --> 00:07:51.830
our changes and notice under the appearance we now have a menus menu.

00:07:51.830 --> 00:07:55.160
We can go back to our site by clicking this link just here.

00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:59.705
You can see now we have our Home and our Blog links from our menu.

00:07:59.705 --> 00:08:02.315
This is now over on the left-hand side,

00:08:02.315 --> 00:08:05.080
but this is something which we can easily fix now.

00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:08.630
Back over to the menu in your header.php file

00:08:08.630 --> 00:08:12.980
surrounding our menu and in fact I'm just going to remove this unordered list.

00:08:12.980 --> 00:08:16.585
We still have this surrounding div with the Bootstrap classes.

00:08:16.585 --> 00:08:18.800
We are going to remove this in just a moment.

00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.020
But for now we can use this as a reference,

00:08:21.020 --> 00:08:24.865
since we are basically replacing this with the parameters below.

00:08:24.865 --> 00:08:28.010
The theme location is set to primary.

00:08:28.010 --> 00:08:33.460
This is fine since this links up with the name in our functions of primary just here.

00:08:33.460 --> 00:08:36.135
Next up we have the depth of the menu.

00:08:36.135 --> 00:08:38.480
We're going to set this to be a value of one.

00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:41.410
Since this menu is not a drop down.

00:08:41.410 --> 00:08:45.870
Our container also has the class of justify-content-end.

00:08:45.870 --> 00:08:51.385
So I'm going to copy this and add this at the end of the container class.

00:08:51.385 --> 00:08:55.320
This will move our menu back over to the right-hand side.

00:08:55.320 --> 00:08:58.260
The ID of navbar-nav,

00:08:58.260 --> 00:09:02.810
we can take this and add this as the container ID.

00:09:02.820 --> 00:09:06.790
We can also remove the margin right value of auto,

00:09:06.790 --> 00:09:08.890
since we don't use this in our theme.

00:09:08.890 --> 00:09:11.410
This is our container now replicated,

00:09:11.410 --> 00:09:17.030
and down at the bottom we created a new navwalker instance to use now theme.

00:09:17.030 --> 00:09:21.115
All that's left to now do is to remove the surrounding div,

00:09:21.115 --> 00:09:28.400
the opening, and also the closing tags of the browser and then we can reload.

00:09:28.400 --> 00:09:31.915
Okay, good our menu is now pushed over to the right.

00:09:31.915 --> 00:09:35.974
If we go to the developer tools by right-click and inspect,

00:09:35.974 --> 00:09:38.234
Click on the "Inspector",

00:09:38.234 --> 00:09:40.155
and go to the menu.

00:09:40.155 --> 00:09:43.760
When it's find the div with the ID of navbar-nav,

00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:48.800
which now contains all of our div and classes which will reset in the navwalker,

00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:53.935
and then nested inside we have our unordered list and then our list items.

00:09:53.935 --> 00:09:55.890
If we now close this down,

00:09:55.890 --> 00:09:57.480
we can click on the links.

00:09:57.480 --> 00:10:00.980
WordPress now has full control over where we're taken to.

00:10:00.980 --> 00:10:04.190
We no longer see any of the HTML links at the top.

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.200
So our menu is now working as

00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:10.790
expected and this is how we can add a custom menu to our theme.

00:10:10.790 --> 00:10:14.370
Next we're going to work on fixing our images.
