00:00:00.860 --> 00:00:04.650
In the last video, we finished off the header section.

00:00:04.650 --> 00:00:07.065
If you take a look at the finished version,

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:10.845
we're now going to move down to this 'Welcome section,' we see here.

00:00:10.845 --> 00:00:14.275
This will give us a chance to work with columns for laying out

00:00:14.275 --> 00:00:18.360
content into equal parts or three parts in our case.

00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:20.610
If we shrink down the browser,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:22.215
we see this section,

00:00:22.215 --> 00:00:25.650
along with all the little sections, is full responsive.

00:00:25.650 --> 00:00:28.980
Then we'll stock in a smallest screen view.

00:00:28.980 --> 00:00:31.545
In the index dot HTML.

00:00:31.545 --> 00:00:35.650
This content will go just below the header which we finished.

00:00:35.650 --> 00:00:37.740
Let's go and do this now.

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:40.155
We locate the closing header tag.

00:00:40.155 --> 00:00:42.855
The first thing to do is to create a div.

00:00:42.855 --> 00:00:46.640
This is going to have a class of container fluids,

00:00:49.010 --> 00:00:52.500
just like the header section, did too.

00:00:52.500 --> 00:00:55.300
Then also a class of Tech Center,

00:00:55.300 --> 00:00:57.190
to add our text positioning.

00:00:57.190 --> 00:00:59.725
Then we're going to add some padding.

00:00:59.725 --> 00:01:03.175
We're going to use this with py-5.

00:01:03.175 --> 00:01:05.860
Now this may look a little bit confusing.

00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:10.290
Let's go to the Bootstrap documentation in the sidebar.

00:01:10.290 --> 00:01:14.315
If we go to utilities and then down to spacing.

00:01:14.315 --> 00:01:19.450
This explains how we can use margin and padding as our class names.

00:01:19.450 --> 00:01:25.045
We need to build these up with a P for padding or an M for margin.

00:01:25.045 --> 00:01:28.390
In our case, we've used py-5.

00:01:28.390 --> 00:01:31.100
P for padding and then we can use,

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:33.950
the top, bottom, left and right values.

00:01:33.950 --> 00:01:39.515
Or we can set the x and y to apply them to the top and bottom or left and right,

00:01:39.515 --> 00:01:43.585
followed by a size of zero through to five.

00:01:43.585 --> 00:01:49.235
In our case, the py is certainly padding value on the top and bottom.

00:01:49.235 --> 00:01:54.470
It can also have a play around with these different values too to see to your project.

00:01:54.470 --> 00:01:57.800
The next thing I want to do is to create a row which is going to be

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.985
wrapper for our texts and also this icon in the middle.

00:02:01.985 --> 00:02:04.400
Inside of our container,

00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:09.060
let's add a second div with the class of row.

00:02:09.790 --> 00:02:13.570
Then nest it inside here we can add our columns,

00:02:13.570 --> 00:02:15.920
Bootstrap uses a 12-column grid.

00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:18.860
If we set a div to be six columns wide,

00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:21.835
it will take up half the width of the screen.

00:02:21.835 --> 00:02:24.765
At the moment, each one of these have four columns,

00:02:24.765 --> 00:02:26.880
so four, four, and four.

00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.105
We can also set our Welcome to tranquil spa text to be the size of six columns.

00:02:33.105 --> 00:02:35.855
Then offset it by a value of three,

00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:37.895
which will push this into the middle.

00:02:37.895 --> 00:02:42.570
Giving three columns on the left and then three columns on the right.

00:02:42.570 --> 00:02:47.380
Inside of our row, lets add the div.

00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:54.830
The class to set our columns is going to be called -md, -six,

00:02:54.830 --> 00:02:59.990
meaning this will be the width of six columns on medium devices and above,

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:03.035
all the full width on smaller devices.

00:03:03.035 --> 00:03:09.685
As we mentioned before, we can also offset this on medium devices by three columns.

00:03:09.685 --> 00:03:12.455
If I now save and then reload,

00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:17.090
you don't see anything because we have not yet added any content.

00:03:17.090 --> 00:03:21.830
If we add our level three heading inside here with a text of,

00:03:21.830 --> 00:03:24.480
'Welcome to Tranquil Spa.'

00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:29.860
We should now be able to save and then see something on the screen.

00:03:29.860 --> 00:03:35.990
The level three heading takes up six columns or half of the 12-column grid.

00:03:35.990 --> 00:03:39.095
The remaining six columns has been split on

00:03:39.095 --> 00:03:43.345
either side because we offset this by a value of three.

00:03:43.345 --> 00:03:48.870
Next up we need to add our icon or our image just below.

00:03:51.650 --> 00:03:55.245
The source, this is in the Images folder.

00:03:55.245 --> 00:03:59.105
The image which has been provided for this is divider purple,

00:03:59.105 --> 00:04:02.680
the old text of divider two.

00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:07.080
Then a class of W25.

00:04:07.080 --> 00:04:10.745
Again, if we go back over to the Bootstrap utilities,

00:04:10.745 --> 00:04:13.795
we can take a look at the sizing.

00:04:13.795 --> 00:04:18.270
W25 will set the width to be 25 percent.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:22.410
W50 will set the width to be 50 percent and so on.

00:04:22.410 --> 00:04:27.440
Save this and then we can check this out in our project reload.

00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:32.645
Okay, good. The next stage is to go down and add these images.

00:04:32.645 --> 00:04:37.040
These images are also going to have a wrapper which is going to be a div.

00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:41.225
This is going to be a separate row too because we're on a new line.

00:04:41.225 --> 00:04:44.395
Then inside of this row we're going to create three new divs.

00:04:44.395 --> 00:04:47.515
Each one with a width of four columns.

00:04:47.515 --> 00:04:49.670
Just after this row here,

00:04:49.670 --> 00:04:52.024
but still within our container.

00:04:52.024 --> 00:04:55.600
That's just a spelling mistake there.

00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:58.070
Okay, just after this div here,

00:04:58.070 --> 00:05:01.155
we're going to make some space and then add a new row.

00:05:01.155 --> 00:05:06.725
The div with the class of row,

00:05:06.725 --> 00:05:09.950
also going to add some additional classes to this div.

00:05:09.950 --> 00:05:13.255
We're also going to add some margin to the top.

00:05:13.255 --> 00:05:16.605
Add some spacing which is a value of four.

00:05:16.605 --> 00:05:21.260
Going to set the display type to be flex using d flex and

00:05:21.260 --> 00:05:26.760
then add some Flexbox spacing with justify content around.

00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.435
Inside here we can take a better look at how columns work.

00:05:32.435 --> 00:05:38.670
We can then add a class of col sm four.

00:05:38.690 --> 00:05:42.770
Meaning that's on small screens and above this table,

00:05:42.770 --> 00:05:45.140
half the width of four columns.

00:05:45.140 --> 00:05:47.825
If we paste this in two more times,

00:05:47.825 --> 00:05:50.505
let's say a, b,

00:05:50.505 --> 00:05:54.305
and c. Check this out on the browser.

00:05:54.305 --> 00:05:57.965
Each of these three divs will take up an equal space.

00:05:57.965 --> 00:05:59.810
Instead of a, b, and c,

00:05:59.810 --> 00:06:03.115
we want to add an image and then some textures below.

00:06:03.115 --> 00:06:05.900
Let's just remove these two divs for now.

00:06:05.900 --> 00:06:08.840
Instead of a, we can add a image.

00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:13.655
The image source is going to be the images folder.

00:06:13.655 --> 00:06:20.520
Then the makeup.jpeg, make up image as the alt.

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:24.155
Then we can add some Bootstrap classes into here.

00:06:24.155 --> 00:06:27.635
I'm going to construct this as a Bootstrap card.

00:06:27.635 --> 00:06:29.960
Will go over to the documentation.

00:06:29.960 --> 00:06:32.255
We see what card will look like.

00:06:32.255 --> 00:06:34.520
If we go to the components,

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.465
then down to a card.

00:06:36.465 --> 00:06:39.485
There's lots of different variations we can use.

00:06:39.485 --> 00:06:43.595
I want to use a very simple one to get a layout very similar to this.

00:06:43.595 --> 00:06:47.530
We are going to use the card on the image of card, image top.

00:06:47.530 --> 00:06:49.680
Card body for the bomb section.

00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.715
Then cards text for the actual contents,

00:06:52.715 --> 00:06:55.805
which will give us some nice layout and styling.

00:06:55.805 --> 00:06:57.845
First of all, in image,

00:06:57.845 --> 00:07:03.435
we can add the class of cards img top.

00:07:03.435 --> 00:07:06.800
Then a div for the actual content just below.

00:07:06.800 --> 00:07:10.350
This div will have a class of card body.

00:07:12.980 --> 00:07:18.790
Then nested inside our text. Here a makeup.

00:07:20.060 --> 00:07:26.389
Instead of the ampersand, I'm going to use a HTML entity of AMP.

00:07:26.389 --> 00:07:30.570
This text needs a class of card text.

00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:36.995
Okay, so save this and see how this is looking.

00:07:36.995 --> 00:07:40.940
We only have one div at the minute so this is centered in the middle,

00:07:40.940 --> 00:07:45.085
but this will get pushed to the side once we add our second, and third div.

00:07:45.085 --> 00:07:47.210
If we take a look at the finished version,

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:50.330
we can see on the image it has this rounded corners.

00:07:50.330 --> 00:07:54.980
This is a novel Bootstrap utility class which is being provided.

00:07:54.980 --> 00:07:59.750
We can add this as a class on image of the card image top.

00:07:59.750 --> 00:08:02.905
This is rounded circle.

00:08:02.905 --> 00:08:07.210
This is all we need to add to now transform our image.

00:08:07.210 --> 00:08:10.115
Rather than typing out all these classes again,

00:08:10.115 --> 00:08:15.790
I'm going to copy this div and then paste this in two more times.

00:08:15.790 --> 00:08:19.615
The middle one, if we look at the final project,

00:08:19.615 --> 00:08:24.595
this one is going to be the candles image and then need texts of spa facilities,

00:08:24.595 --> 00:08:29.345
this probably makeup, this one is candles.jpeg,

00:08:29.345 --> 00:08:38.050
the old text of candles image then spa facilities.

00:08:38.790 --> 00:08:42.235
All the rest of the classes will stay the same.

00:08:42.235 --> 00:08:48.750
The third one is going to be for the retreat, retreat.jpeg.

00:08:48.750 --> 00:08:52.510
The makeup image is now retreat image.

00:08:53.150 --> 00:08:55.980
Then the text at the end,

00:08:55.980 --> 00:08:58.540
I'll take a tour.

00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:03.730
Okay, let's see how this is looking back in the browser.

00:09:03.730 --> 00:09:07.160
Refresh there's all three images. All good.

00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:12.045
Okay, so there's now just one or two more things we need to do just to finish this off.

00:09:12.045 --> 00:09:14.635
If we take a look at the finished version,

00:09:14.635 --> 00:09:19.865
we can see that the images are a little bit smaller and the text is a bit bigger.

00:09:19.865 --> 00:09:23.275
This is because if we look at our version,

00:09:23.275 --> 00:09:26.215
we've used up all of the available 12 columns.

00:09:26.215 --> 00:09:28.620
So four, four, and four.

00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.240
I'm going to make this a little bit smaller by

00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:35.240
changing all three of these to be a value of three.

00:09:35.750 --> 00:09:39.030
Save, refresh.

00:09:39.030 --> 00:09:42.300
Now I've got a little bit more spacing around the images.

00:09:42.300 --> 00:09:47.000
These all still centered because we've justified the content around,

00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:50.045
then we've got equal space on all sides.

00:09:50.045 --> 00:09:53.480
Next up, we can make the text at the bottom a little bit

00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:57.155
bigger by overriding the Bootstrap styles.

00:09:57.155 --> 00:10:02.240
The Bootstrap class of card text has been applied to the text.

00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:05.180
Let's go to our custom CSS,

00:10:05.180 --> 00:10:07.610
just above the media query.

00:10:07.610 --> 00:10:11.909
We can add the text of, 'Welcome section.'

00:10:12.740 --> 00:10:17.155
The one and only style we need to add is card text.

00:10:17.155 --> 00:10:23.490
I'm going to need this to be a font size of 1.2 rems.

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:27.450
Open up Chrome, reload.

00:10:27.450 --> 00:10:32.095
Now that looks a lot better and more like the final version.

00:10:32.095 --> 00:10:36.860
Let's just now finished with the welcome section and take a look at

00:10:36.860 --> 00:10:41.465
how we can use columns along with using different Bootstrap utilities.

00:10:41.465 --> 00:10:44.610
Thank you and I'll see you next time.
