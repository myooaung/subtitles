00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.875
We now move on to the Contact Us page,

00:00:04.875 --> 00:00:09.840
which is located in the footer navigation just down at the bottom here.

00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:11.700
To begin to create this,

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:17.775
we first need to create a new page inside the Dashboard. Where is the dashboard?

00:00:17.775 --> 00:00:21.670
Then go to Pages, Add New.

00:00:22.250 --> 00:00:24.780
We don't need to add any content,

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:28.065
just a page title of Contact Us,

00:00:28.065 --> 00:00:30.880
then we can publish this.

00:00:31.670 --> 00:00:35.745
Now a corresponding file inside of our theme.

00:00:35.745 --> 00:00:39.675
Open up the sidebar, click on add a new page,

00:00:39.675 --> 00:00:48.165
and it's going to be called page.contactsus.php.

00:00:48.165 --> 00:00:51.950
The naming for this file is important here too,

00:00:51.950 --> 00:00:56.290
there is a custom use template for one specific page,

00:00:56.290 --> 00:01:01.675
and WordPress recognizes this because of this page dash prefix in the file name,

00:01:01.675 --> 00:01:04.570
followed by the slug of contact us.

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.520
The slug is the WordPress term for the URL after your domain.

00:01:09.520 --> 00:01:14.425
For example, if you had your domain.com or slash contact,

00:01:14.425 --> 00:01:17.405
WordPress will consider contact to be the slug.

00:01:17.405 --> 00:01:23.590
You can find out the slug name for any page on the site by visiting it in the browser.

00:01:23.590 --> 00:01:25.880
Let's go to our sites.

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:27.795
Let's click on the blog.

00:01:27.795 --> 00:01:30.315
This slug, this page is the blog,

00:01:30.315 --> 00:01:34.590
off we go back to our new Contact Us page which we just created,

00:01:34.590 --> 00:01:36.675
click on the permalink,

00:01:36.675 --> 00:01:38.475
and we can see the URL slug,

00:01:38.475 --> 00:01:41.115
for this new page is Contact Us.

00:01:41.115 --> 00:01:43.335
This new Contact Us page.

00:01:43.335 --> 00:01:45.510
If you go to Visit Site,

00:01:45.510 --> 00:01:48.860
and then scroll down to the footer menu,

00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:52.825
we've not yet created this footer menu in WordPress just yet.

00:01:52.825 --> 00:01:54.670
These links that we select,

00:01:54.670 --> 00:01:59.030
is still pointing it to our HTML files that were created in bootstrap.

00:01:59.030 --> 00:02:02.175
We will create this footer menu my in a later video,

00:02:02.175 --> 00:02:05.365
so for now if we want to visit this new Contact Us page,

00:02:05.365 --> 00:02:10.625
all you need to do is to type in the slug of Contact Us which we've seen before,

00:02:10.625 --> 00:02:14.240
or click on view page from the edit screen.

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.980
We don't have any content yet,

00:02:15.980 --> 00:02:20.690
so let's go over to our template and let's get to work starting with our comments,

00:02:20.690 --> 00:02:22.935
so this is php,

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:27.380
close this off, and we add our command in

00:02:27.380 --> 00:02:34.430
the usual way using stars and the forward slashes, the template name.

00:02:35.900 --> 00:02:39.520
It's going to be Contact Us.

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:42.995
We're going to use the same header as the rest of the site,

00:02:42.995 --> 00:02:46.490
so we can use the get underscore header function.

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:50.975
All is in. Then after this we can add our footer down at the

00:02:50.975 --> 00:02:58.585
bottom,so php get the footer, then close this off.

00:02:58.585 --> 00:03:02.420
When creating a customer templates like this one,

00:03:02.420 --> 00:03:07.790
i.e not a recognized template name such as the header, the footer,

00:03:07.790 --> 00:03:10.135
and the single dot php,

00:03:10.135 --> 00:03:12.455
we should also add a template name,

00:03:12.455 --> 00:03:14.755
just like we have done at the top here.

00:03:14.755 --> 00:03:17.075
When we add a template name,

00:03:17.075 --> 00:03:20.015
it becomes available in the edit page section,

00:03:20.015 --> 00:03:24.800
so we can assign this custom page template to any page which you want.

00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.275
If you go back and then go to our Contact Us page.

00:03:29.275 --> 00:03:30.890
In the Contact Us page,

00:03:30.890 --> 00:03:33.185
we go down to the page attributes.

00:03:33.185 --> 00:03:36.185
This is also available on any of the page.

00:03:36.185 --> 00:03:40.900
We can see we can select any templates which is available in our theme.

00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:45.415
We don't however, need to select Contact Us in this instance,

00:03:45.415 --> 00:03:51.745
because the page template name of Contact Us will match the slug for this page.

00:03:51.745 --> 00:03:55.640
We can prove this by adding some random text into the template,

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.985
so at the moment we still got the default selected.

00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:02.885
Let's go into here and just add some random texts.

00:04:02.885 --> 00:04:09.975
View our page; make sure this is saved. Here is the page.

00:04:09.975 --> 00:04:11.850
There's our header footer,

00:04:11.850 --> 00:04:14.440
and also our random text.

00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.285
Before we move on to editing this page,

00:04:17.285 --> 00:04:21.590
I just want to take a moment to talk a little bit more about page templates.

00:04:21.590 --> 00:04:23.480
As we discussed before,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:29.150
this is a custom page template intended to be used on one specific page.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:34.835
WordPress recognizes this because of the page dash prefix which you mentioned before,

00:04:34.835 --> 00:04:37.930
followed by the pages slug of Contact Us,

00:04:37.930 --> 00:04:40.145
so we have this one covered.

00:04:40.145 --> 00:04:43.460
We can also create templates for global use,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:47.045
i.e to be used on as many pages as we want.

00:04:47.045 --> 00:04:50.250
It's important when creating global templates,

00:04:50.250 --> 00:04:54.200
we do not use this page dash prefix as WordPress will

00:04:54.200 --> 00:04:58.535
think this is a specialized templates for one particular page.

00:04:58.535 --> 00:05:05.045
These global templates are for common things such as a two or three column page layout,

00:05:05.045 --> 00:05:08.030
and it's also common to see a naming convention,

00:05:08.030 --> 00:05:15.290
so just page, underscore two columns like this,

00:05:15.290 --> 00:05:19.435
or we can do the same and have a second templates, which is global.

00:05:19.435 --> 00:05:22.340
It can be for three columns as long as we don't have

00:05:22.340 --> 00:05:25.625
the page dash prefix will cover it on this.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.695
If we want to create anything like this,

00:05:27.695 --> 00:05:30.290
all we need to do is to create our files,

00:05:30.290 --> 00:05:33.230
and then give them a name comments so that available

00:05:33.230 --> 00:05:37.120
in the WordPress Dashboard deselect, just like this one.

00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:40.925
Good, so now we understand the different types of templates.

00:05:40.925 --> 00:05:44.375
Let's get back on to editing this Contact Us page.

00:05:44.375 --> 00:05:47.840
We have mostly discovered in our bootstrap templates.

00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.285
Let's head over to our bootstrap projects.

00:05:50.285 --> 00:05:53.059
The contact on the HTML extension,

00:05:53.059 --> 00:05:54.905
which is from our bootstrap sides.

00:05:54.905 --> 00:05:57.655
We're going to copy the Contact Us section,

00:05:57.655 --> 00:06:00.240
so scroll down below the header.

00:06:00.240 --> 00:06:02.190
We already have this included,

00:06:02.190 --> 00:06:05.230
copy the Contact Us section,

00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:08.685
all this up to our footer section,

00:06:08.685 --> 00:06:10.630
then in our page contact us,

00:06:10.630 --> 00:06:13.370
we can paste this just below get header,

00:06:13.370 --> 00:06:14.945
and test if this is working.

00:06:14.945 --> 00:06:19.225
If I go Into to WordPress and reloading our contact us page.

00:06:19.225 --> 00:06:22.775
Good, we now have the contact us page display in

00:06:22.775 --> 00:06:27.050
the actual contact form functionality to be able to send a message.

00:06:27.050 --> 00:06:29.585
We will come back to in a later video.

00:06:29.585 --> 00:06:34.600
But there are still a few small modifications we need to make before we finish.

00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.165
First, we can grab the title of Contact Us dynamically,

00:06:39.165 --> 00:06:42.425
and then second of all is to fix his image we have below.

00:06:42.425 --> 00:06:45.845
This is done in the same way as we did earlier on the course,

00:06:45.845 --> 00:06:47.920
all the rest of the images.

00:06:47.920 --> 00:06:49.920
First we can do the title,

00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:52.375
so the page contact us.

00:06:52.375 --> 00:06:59.070
Let's look for the hard coded version, which is just here.

00:06:59.070 --> 00:07:01.880
Let's cut Contact Us over here.

00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:07.419
We can then generate this using php using the underscore title,

00:07:07.419 --> 00:07:10.880
which is a WordPress function which we looked at earlier.

00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:17.274
Then we can modify the image URL using get template's directory uri,

00:07:17.274 --> 00:07:19.750
so in the image source,

00:07:19.750 --> 00:07:23.495
just before this, we can add some php.

00:07:23.495 --> 00:07:27.744
The opening tags, we're going to echo

00:07:27.744 --> 00:07:33.505
escape url to remove any characters which shouldn't be there.

00:07:33.505 --> 00:07:41.405
Then inside here the WordPress function of get templates directory uri,

00:07:41.405 --> 00:07:46.075
to point to the home location of our directory, the brackets,

00:07:46.075 --> 00:07:48.925
and then we can close this off add a semicolon,

00:07:48.925 --> 00:07:51.320
then close off the php.

00:07:51.320 --> 00:07:54.580
Just after this, we also have our images file path,

00:07:54.580 --> 00:07:57.025
which is Images divider purple,

00:07:57.025 --> 00:08:01.645
so we also need to add the forward slash just before this file path.

00:08:01.645 --> 00:08:04.945
We can save this and then it reload in the browser.

00:08:04.945 --> 00:08:08.155
We now have a dynamic Contact Us title,

00:08:08.155 --> 00:08:10.450
and our work in image,

00:08:10.450 --> 00:08:13.705
our contact template is now in place.

00:08:13.705 --> 00:08:15.490
We will return back to this later on in

00:08:15.490 --> 00:08:19.640
the course to make this fully functional within WordPress.
