00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.580
We have our form now showing in our Contact Us page,

00:00:05.580 --> 00:00:09.465
but we still need to re-introduce our Bootstrap CSS.

00:00:09.465 --> 00:00:13.095
We can add this directly into contact form seven,

00:00:13.095 --> 00:00:15.720
and we'll do this in just a moment.

00:00:15.720 --> 00:00:19.590
First though, we need to deal with these slightly trickier surrounding

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:24.285
form elements over in the page Contact Us.PHP.

00:00:24.285 --> 00:00:27.195
Inside here with our original form,

00:00:27.195 --> 00:00:29.445
had a class all text left.

00:00:29.445 --> 00:00:32.580
If we now go and take a look at our contact form seven

00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:35.415
version inside of the developer tools.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:37.725
Right-click and inspect.

00:00:37.725 --> 00:00:42.130
Use a selector to grab our form.

00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:46.500
This is the form just here. Let's take a look at this.

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.940
This form has a auto-generated form wrapper,

00:00:49.940 --> 00:00:51.995
so we need to add our class to this.

00:00:51.995 --> 00:00:57.545
As you can see, we just have a auto-generated class and no reference to our text left.

00:00:57.545 --> 00:01:01.220
In this situation, we need to add the class to our short code

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:05.810
directly using the attribute called HTML_class.

00:01:05.810 --> 00:01:13.115
Inside of our square brackets for the short code HTML_class.

00:01:13.115 --> 00:01:18.480
I'm going to add this to a string which is our class name of text-left.

00:01:18.710 --> 00:01:23.630
Now let's save this and go back over to the browser and reload.

00:01:23.630 --> 00:01:27.065
You can see straight away that the form is over on the left,

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:28.985
and inside of our class section,

00:01:28.985 --> 00:01:31.565
we have the class of text left.

00:01:31.565 --> 00:01:34.520
If we also needed to add a custom ID,

00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:38.240
we could do this with a HTML_ID attributes.

00:01:38.240 --> 00:01:41.345
Again add this to the short code.

00:01:41.345 --> 00:01:47.705
The rest of the styling is added directly into our form over in the dashboard.

00:01:47.705 --> 00:01:50.855
Beginning with our form group wrapper,

00:01:50.855 --> 00:01:52.774
which we had over in HTML,

00:01:52.774 --> 00:01:54.815
which is this surrounding div,

00:01:54.815 --> 00:01:57.935
is called round each one of our form inputs.

00:01:57.935 --> 00:02:00.730
We need to add this in three times.

00:02:00.730 --> 00:02:04.100
Let's make some space and add our div,

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:09.000
the opening tag with the class of form-group.

00:02:10.540 --> 00:02:14.490
I'm just going to copy this line here.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:20.600
Close the div off, then we can add our second surrounding form group

00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:27.100
around the email and then our third one is for the message.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:32.190
Goes off just below and that's now all free wrapped.

00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:34.880
Well, the need to add our attributes back in it to

00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:39.050
these inputs using the colon syntax, just like this.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.975
Inside of the square brackets,

00:02:41.975 --> 00:02:45.020
we can add a class to our name.

00:02:45.020 --> 00:02:48.289
This is going to be a class of form control.

00:02:48.289 --> 00:02:53.420
These are the classes again inside of our inputs to the class of form control,

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:54.889
the id of name,

00:02:54.889 --> 00:02:58.175
and we could also add a placeholder inside here too.

00:02:58.175 --> 00:03:00.320
We don't need any separating commas,

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.690
so we can just go ahead and double id,

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.420
which is going to be the name.

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:08.815
The next one is the placeholder.

00:03:08.815 --> 00:03:11.130
This is going to be a string.

00:03:11.130 --> 00:03:13.840
In fact, we don't need a colon for this one.

00:03:13.840 --> 00:03:20.070
It says enter your name and these three dots afterwards.

00:03:20.070 --> 00:03:22.535
Next up we have the email.

00:03:22.535 --> 00:03:25.910
You can do exactly the same inside the square brackets.

00:03:25.910 --> 00:03:29.500
This has the same class of form control,

00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:32.590
the id of email,

00:03:32.590 --> 00:03:36.415
and also the placeholder as a string,

00:03:36.415 --> 00:03:40.060
so enter your email.

00:03:40.070 --> 00:03:42.585
Finally, the text area,

00:03:42.585 --> 00:03:45.870
this also has a class of form control.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:52.440
The id this time is message.

00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:55.215
We can also add the number of rows,

00:03:55.215 --> 00:03:57.565
which is going to be three.

00:03:57.565 --> 00:04:00.335
Next we have the submit button,

00:04:00.335 --> 00:04:02.615
and this has two classes in our code.

00:04:02.615 --> 00:04:05.900
If we look at the bottom, this has the class of btn and

00:04:05.900 --> 00:04:10.935
btn-primary with the submit button using contact form seven now.

00:04:10.935 --> 00:04:13.880
We need to add in the class attribute twice for this,

00:04:13.880 --> 00:04:17.560
since it is not like the wide-spaces in-between.

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:19.470
Just have to submit.

00:04:19.470 --> 00:04:23.905
We can add our first class, which is btn.

00:04:23.905 --> 00:04:34.420
Second class of btn-primary and then the text of send message, dot-dot-dot.

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:37.095
Now if we hit save.

00:04:37.095 --> 00:04:39.715
The save button in the corner.

00:04:39.715 --> 00:04:43.295
Head over to our project and refresh this.

00:04:43.295 --> 00:04:46.280
The form styling is getting pretty close,

00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:49.175
but it's still not the full width which we had before.

00:04:49.175 --> 00:04:51.200
This is because of a difference between

00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:55.730
our HTML underway is output by contact form seven.

00:04:55.730 --> 00:04:59.300
We had our labels followed by the inputs.

00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:02.525
Both elements alongside each other in the code.

00:05:02.525 --> 00:05:07.445
For this plugin we will nest the inputs inside of the label.

00:05:07.445 --> 00:05:09.245
All we need to do to fix this,

00:05:09.245 --> 00:05:14.455
is to make the label a 100 percent wide inside of our styles.css.

00:05:14.455 --> 00:05:19.760
We can do this outside of the media query.

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:22.160
We can remove this tag offer section.

00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:25.370
We can add the customer contact form seven class,

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:32.865
which is wpcf7-form inside the label.

00:05:32.865 --> 00:05:41.080
Then some simple CSS to set this to a width of a 100 percent. It gives us a save.

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:43.965
There we go, that's our contact.

00:05:43.965 --> 00:05:46.480
Now back to being full width.

00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:48.665
Just before we wrap this video up,

00:05:48.665 --> 00:05:52.240
let's go over to our contact form inside the dashboard.

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.690
Then we have some more tabs just next to our form.

00:05:55.690 --> 00:06:00.050
Here we can select the email address where we want our messages to go to.

00:06:00.050 --> 00:06:05.125
By default, this is the one which is provided with our site when we set this up.

00:06:05.125 --> 00:06:07.790
We can also pass in lots of different information,

00:06:07.790 --> 00:06:12.410
such as the subjects and also how the message is laid out.

00:06:12.410 --> 00:06:14.855
Inside the message section.

00:06:14.855 --> 00:06:18.295
We also have lots of messages we can add it.

00:06:18.295 --> 00:06:22.130
Such as the pop-up when the message was sent successfully,

00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:27.030
if it has failed, and also if any validation errors occur too.

00:06:27.230 --> 00:06:30.590
Also is an additional settings section here.

00:06:30.590 --> 00:06:33.500
If you want to go into any more advanced features,

00:06:33.500 --> 00:06:37.765
if the default functionality doesn't cover anything you need.

00:06:37.765 --> 00:06:40.820
This is it now for the contact form styling.

00:06:40.820 --> 00:06:45.480
I'll see you in the next video where we'll add Google Forms.
