00:00:00.920 --> 00:00:06.645
Welcome back. Now we have a version of WordPress running on our computer.

00:00:06.645 --> 00:00:09.375
We're now going to begin the process of transferring

00:00:09.375 --> 00:00:13.020
our Bootstrap template over to a WordPress theme.

00:00:13.020 --> 00:00:15.839
Inside of local by flywheel,

00:00:15.839 --> 00:00:20.805
we can provide the new theme folder by navigating to our directory.

00:00:20.805 --> 00:00:22.595
In this little icon just here,

00:00:22.595 --> 00:00:27.735
we can click on this and then we're taken to where our project is stored,

00:00:27.735 --> 00:00:29.670
inside the project name,

00:00:29.670 --> 00:00:34.380
we can go to up, then down to "WP content" and

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:38.990
then to "Themes" and then inside here we can see the free default themes,

00:00:38.990 --> 00:00:41.740
which are installed with WordPress by default.

00:00:41.740 --> 00:00:44.840
If you've chosen to follow along with this course, use MAMP,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:48.815
needs navigate to the MAMP directory, open this up,

00:00:48.815 --> 00:00:51.215
then go to the HT docs,

00:00:51.215 --> 00:00:52.820
open up the project,

00:00:52.820 --> 00:00:55.675
then go to content and then themes

00:00:55.675 --> 00:00:59.500
and then you can continue along exactly as we are going to do.

00:00:59.500 --> 00:01:02.960
So inside here is where we are going to place our new theme.

00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:11.180
To do this, I'm going to duplicate our bootstrap template and then once this is done,

00:01:11.180 --> 00:01:15.830
I'm going to rename this, tranquil WP.

00:01:15.880 --> 00:01:20.920
Once we've done it, we can drag this over into our themes,

00:01:20.920 --> 00:01:24.450
so WordPress has access to our theme folder.

00:01:24.450 --> 00:01:28.820
The next step is to drag this over in to your text editor.

00:01:28.820 --> 00:01:32.750
This opens up in place of the bootstrap version.

00:01:32.750 --> 00:01:35.360
Now since WordPress uses PHP,

00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:40.580
the first step is to rename the index page from index.html.

00:01:40.580 --> 00:01:45.665
We're going to change the extension at the end to be index.php.

00:01:45.665 --> 00:01:48.755
This is one of the required files in

00:01:48.755 --> 00:01:53.840
a WordPress theme and then inside here we need to add a comment at the top of the file.

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:57.755
This comment is going to be inside of the PHP tags,

00:01:57.755 --> 00:02:00.080
then tuned into PHP code,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:04.945
then we can close this off with another question mark and the closing arrow.

00:02:04.945 --> 00:02:08.325
Then we can add our PHP comment inside.

00:02:08.325 --> 00:02:15.835
A PHP command is a forward/ and then a star and then ends with a star and then forward/.

00:02:15.835 --> 00:02:19.615
Then we can type in any contents which you want inside here.

00:02:19.615 --> 00:02:26.430
I'm just going to add the text of the main template file and then save this.

00:02:26.430 --> 00:02:31.835
The other required file in our theme is the style.css.

00:02:31.835 --> 00:02:35.390
We have a custom CSS file inside of the CSS folder,

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:42.115
so I'm going to grab the custom CSS and drag this in to the root of the project.

00:02:42.115 --> 00:02:46.595
Make sure this is along side the rest of the pages which we'll have in here.

00:02:46.595 --> 00:02:51.110
This file for WordPress needs be renamed the style.css.

00:02:51.110 --> 00:02:53.749
So it's recognized by WordPress.

00:02:53.749 --> 00:02:58.550
The style.css also needs a comment at the top of the file.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:03.485
However, this comment is a little bit different to the one we add in the index page.

00:03:03.485 --> 00:03:05.980
If we go over to the browser,

00:03:05.980 --> 00:03:07.955
then open up a search engine,

00:03:07.955 --> 00:03:10.910
if we search for the codex theme style sheets,

00:03:10.910 --> 00:03:14.425
the first link we get should be for the WordPress codex.

00:03:14.425 --> 00:03:17.975
We've refer to the codex many times throughout this course

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:22.285
to see the information about the WordPress functions, which we can use.

00:03:22.285 --> 00:03:24.860
We can also click on this link to jump to

00:03:24.860 --> 00:03:29.760
the theme style sheets and this is the exact section which we need.

00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:33.900
This is the comment which we need to add to the top of

00:03:33.900 --> 00:03:38.810
our style sheet and this comment provides different information about our theme,

00:03:38.810 --> 00:03:40.370
such as the author,

00:03:40.370 --> 00:03:43.265
the theme name, we can add a description,

00:03:43.265 --> 00:03:48.965
any licensing information along with any tags which are relative to our theme,

00:03:48.965 --> 00:03:51.305
types such as the color theme,

00:03:51.305 --> 00:03:52.715
the number of columns,

00:03:52.715 --> 00:03:56.695
whether this is responsive and will reach translation ready.

00:03:56.695 --> 00:03:59.820
We can just add any tags in here which we like,

00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:02.945
we do need to refer to the available WordPress tags

00:04:02.945 --> 00:04:07.045
in the theme review handbook and you can check this out if you like.

00:04:07.045 --> 00:04:10.020
At [inaudible] , I'm going to copy this comment as

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:13.955
a starter and then above the body section,

00:04:13.955 --> 00:04:19.685
we can paste this in and it's just a case of editing the contents to suit our theme.

00:04:19.685 --> 00:04:22.769
This is going to be tranquil WP.

00:04:25.690 --> 00:04:27.770
We don't have a link in here,

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:29.970
so I'm just going to make one up,

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:39.130
tranquilspantheme.com, the author, you can add your name into here.

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:45.315
You can add your website if you like, also a description.

00:04:45.315 --> 00:04:51.915
I'm just going to add tranquilspantheme for our WordPress.

00:04:51.915 --> 00:04:53.850
I'm going to leave the version,

00:04:53.850 --> 00:04:56.125
the licensing and for the tags,

00:04:56.125 --> 00:04:57.950
I'm going to remove the colors,

00:04:57.950 --> 00:04:59.950
just give me any colors of your choosing,

00:04:59.950 --> 00:05:03.080
so I'll leave this out and then edit the rest.

00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:05.790
I was going to be translation ready.

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:09.380
We'll add this in a later section.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:12.125
We can add right sidebar.

00:05:12.125 --> 00:05:14.910
We will also include custom headers,

00:05:14.910 --> 00:05:22.120
we'll have featured images and also a custom menu.

00:05:22.130 --> 00:05:24.870
You can of course, after this later on,

00:05:24.870 --> 00:05:27.560
once we add more features but just to finish off,

00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:29.345
I'm going to add the text domain,

00:05:29.345 --> 00:05:31.640
which will match our themes folder name of

00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:40.130
tranquil WP and then we can delete the text right at the bottom and then save this file.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:42.280
The next stage is to move the screenshots,

00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.005
which you have been provided in the images folder.

00:05:45.005 --> 00:05:49.670
If you grab the screenshots.png and then we can drag this to the root of

00:05:49.670 --> 00:05:55.065
our project alongside our style sheets and also all pages.

00:05:55.065 --> 00:05:59.545
This will be the image which will appear next to our theme inside the dashboard.

00:05:59.545 --> 00:06:02.750
If we save this file, this is exactly what we're going to do now.

00:06:02.750 --> 00:06:07.645
We need to go over to the local host in the browser or if you're using flywheel,

00:06:07.645 --> 00:06:10.315
we can select the admin button,

00:06:10.315 --> 00:06:17.255
login if required and the next step is to go down to appearance and then to themes.

00:06:17.255 --> 00:06:20.740
This theme section will have a list of all themes

00:06:20.740 --> 00:06:23.860
which we've seen before inside of the themes folder,

00:06:23.860 --> 00:06:27.250
such as the default ones provided by WordPress and

00:06:27.250 --> 00:06:31.524
now we should also have the theme which we've provided of tranquil WP.

00:06:31.524 --> 00:06:35.425
This is also the screenshot in the background, which you can see here.

00:06:35.425 --> 00:06:37.585
We can check our live preview,

00:06:37.585 --> 00:06:40.790
which I'm just going to simply activate this theme.

00:06:40.790 --> 00:06:45.270
We can check this is working by clicking on visit site.

00:06:46.010 --> 00:06:49.710
This is all the HTML content for our site.

00:06:49.710 --> 00:06:52.020
You can see the site needs some work,

00:06:52.020 --> 00:06:57.860
that is the basic HTML content but this is not under the control of WordPress just yet,

00:06:57.860 --> 00:07:00.805
we simply are putting some basic HTML.

00:07:00.805 --> 00:07:02.760
To begin the conversion process,

00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.130
I'm going to create four new files,

00:07:05.130 --> 00:07:07.350
so we can begin to work on this.

00:07:07.350 --> 00:07:09.585
In the roots of the project,

00:07:09.585 --> 00:07:14.080
the first one is going to be called the header.php.

00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:20.960
The second one is going to be called the footer.php.

00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:28.730
The third one will be for the sidebar with a.php extension and the forth one will be for

00:07:28.730 --> 00:07:33.770
our functions.php and the purpose

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:38.120
of these four files is to breakdown the sections of our HTML,

00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:43.065
then place them into their own custom PHP file and then we can import them

00:07:43.065 --> 00:07:49.050
into our theme as required and we'll begin with this process in the next video.
