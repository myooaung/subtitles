00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:05.925
Next up we're going to look at how we can add featured images to our theme.

00:00:05.925 --> 00:00:10.155
You might also hear these referred to as post thumbnails too.

00:00:10.155 --> 00:00:15.300
These images are used to represent things such as a page or a blog post.

00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:18.720
Now we have control of where these images will display.

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.885
We can place an image inside this blog post preview,

00:00:21.885 --> 00:00:25.980
rather than just having a plain text for the content and the title.

00:00:25.980 --> 00:00:27.470
To enable this feature,

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:29.240
we go over to the functions.

00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:34.085
php, and then we can use the add theme support function to do this.

00:00:34.085 --> 00:00:35.795
If we go up to the top,

00:00:35.795 --> 00:00:37.820
we've already added theme support for

00:00:37.820 --> 00:00:41.390
the automatic feed links and also for the title tag.

00:00:41.390 --> 00:00:44.900
So now we're also going to add support for posts, thumbnails.

00:00:44.900 --> 00:00:47.699
So add theme support,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:52.490
and then as the string inside the brackets,

00:00:52.490 --> 00:00:58.930
we add post hyphen thumbnails with the semicolon at the end.

00:00:58.930 --> 00:01:04.580
We can say this is now working in the edit page or the edit post screen.

00:01:04.580 --> 00:01:06.995
Let's go to any blog posts,

00:01:06.995 --> 00:01:09.840
click on edit post.

00:01:10.640 --> 00:01:15.500
Over in the side bar on the right we have this featured image section.

00:01:15.500 --> 00:01:21.355
We can click on set featured image and then upload any image of our children.

00:01:21.355 --> 00:01:24.785
Have provided free different images to use for this.

00:01:24.785 --> 00:01:27.065
So let's go over to our projects,

00:01:27.065 --> 00:01:30.485
and then I'm going to go inside of all theme folder.

00:01:30.485 --> 00:01:35.600
So tranquilwp , and then down to the images section.

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.920
I'm going to drag over the featured images, candles like smoothing.

00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.495
So let's select all three of these.

00:01:44.495 --> 00:01:49.740
We can then drag these over and then drop them into the media library.

00:01:50.470 --> 00:01:53.840
If we now select one of the images and then click this button

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.765
here to update our blog post,

00:01:56.765 --> 00:01:59.710
let's go all to view post,

00:01:59.710 --> 00:02:02.520
and then to our blog.

00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:06.875
We see for a blog post six and no images are displaying.

00:02:06.875 --> 00:02:09.125
This is because we need to tell the WordPress

00:02:09.125 --> 00:02:12.320
exactly where we want this one to show in our theme.

00:02:12.320 --> 00:02:15.905
We do this with a function called the posts thumbnail,

00:02:15.905 --> 00:02:20.720
and since index.php file displays this list of blog posts,

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:23.105
we need to update inside of there.

00:02:23.105 --> 00:02:27.210
So the side bar and then the index.php,

00:02:27.710 --> 00:02:31.700
and then this image will be displayed for each blog post.

00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:34.480
So we need to add this inside the WordPress loop.

00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:37.580
This can be placed anywhere which you choose,

00:02:37.580 --> 00:02:40.925
and I want to add mine just above the excerpt.

00:02:40.925 --> 00:02:43.955
Let's locate the excerpt which was just here.

00:02:43.955 --> 00:02:46.430
I'm going to add this inside of a div.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:52.650
So it can add a bootstrap class to give you some margin on the y-axis of free.

00:02:52.670 --> 00:02:55.750
Throws off the div.

00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:00.415
Then inside here we can add the WordPress function.

00:03:00.415 --> 00:03:04.200
So php close this off,

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:07.830
and then the function is called the posts thumbnail.

00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:15.470
So now we specified where this is to show in our WordPress loop,

00:03:15.470 --> 00:03:20.545
let's reload, and now we can see our image just above the excerpt.

00:03:20.545 --> 00:03:23.895
This now looks better with our images.

00:03:23.895 --> 00:03:27.200
But remember there is also a vat templates too which

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.440
show our blog post. We have the single.

00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:33.835
php. If we click on one of these posts,

00:03:33.835 --> 00:03:36.860
and we'll see that this doesn't show our featured image.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:40.504
So we can also add this into the single template.

00:03:40.504 --> 00:03:44.105
So let's add this above the contents in the single.

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:50.550
php and also this file,then the contents.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:56.370
I'm going to add the same div with the class of my-3,

00:04:00.890 --> 00:04:04.615
php and the same function,

00:04:04.615 --> 00:04:07.190
which is the posts thumbnail.

00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:12.735
Now let's go to the browser on the single-view,

00:04:12.735 --> 00:04:17.944
reload, and now our image is displayed above the contents.

00:04:17.944 --> 00:04:21.210
We also see blog posts in side of the archives,

00:04:21.210 --> 00:04:24.090
if we select any date from the side bar,

00:04:24.090 --> 00:04:28.165
we also need to add this into the archives template too.

00:04:28.165 --> 00:04:32.125
So I'm going to copy this div from the single.

00:04:32.125 --> 00:04:38.390
Go to the archives and then add this above the excerpt,

00:04:39.030 --> 00:04:44.225
paste this in, and there we go.

00:04:44.225 --> 00:04:47.855
We also need to do this in the search.

00:04:47.855 --> 00:04:51.425
Let's do a search or anything inside here.

00:04:51.425 --> 00:04:53.405
So just blog post three.

00:04:53.405 --> 00:04:57.010
We can also add this inside here, which is the search.

00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.580
php. To keep things consistent,

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:04.920
I'm going to add this above the excerpt.

00:05:04.920 --> 00:05:10.545
Let's locate the excerpt function and also paste in the post thumbnail.

00:05:10.545 --> 00:05:14.600
If we now refresh, we don't see a post image for blog post three.

00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.140
This is because we've only set this on bulk post six.

00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:21.730
Let's do a search for number six, and there we go.

00:05:21.730 --> 00:05:25.340
This all looks fine in this test environment

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:28.930
because all of the supplied images are the same size.

00:05:28.930 --> 00:05:31.910
In reality, this would not always be the case,

00:05:31.910 --> 00:05:34.970
and there is a few different ways we can approach this.

00:05:34.970 --> 00:05:40.570
First is by using the default sciences where press provides the series in action.

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:43.900
We can add any of a random image to a post.

00:05:43.900 --> 00:05:47.050
Let's go to blog posts five.

00:05:47.300 --> 00:05:50.530
Go to edit post,

00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:56.675
and then let's go to our images again inside of our theme folder.

00:05:56.675 --> 00:06:01.955
Then we can add a different image which is not been resized for this purpose.

00:06:01.955 --> 00:06:03.755
So we can use cosmetics.

00:06:03.755 --> 00:06:08.235
jpg, let's go to set the featured image,

00:06:08.235 --> 00:06:14.270
drag this over, and we select this to use,

00:06:14.270 --> 00:06:16.475
update our blog post,

00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:18.990
and go on to our blog.

00:06:20.450 --> 00:06:23.670
So now we have two different size images,

00:06:23.670 --> 00:06:25.620
this doesn't look quite right.

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:29.309
The default image sizes of WordPress are thumbnail,

00:06:29.309 --> 00:06:31.755
medium, large, and full.

00:06:31.755 --> 00:06:34.625
Full being the size of the image which we uploaded.

00:06:34.625 --> 00:06:40.375
These image sizes can be configured in the admin section under the media panel,

00:06:40.375 --> 00:06:42.150
go down to the dashboard,

00:06:42.150 --> 00:06:45.360
and then go down to settings and media.

00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:48.500
Here we have full control of the thumbnail size,

00:06:48.500 --> 00:06:51.620
the medium size, and also the large size.

00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:54.550
But how do we know which one is the plain.

00:06:54.550 --> 00:06:56.460
If we go to our index.

00:06:56.460 --> 00:07:00.455
php for example, where we've added the post thumbnail.

00:07:00.455 --> 00:07:05.030
Inside here we can specify which size we want to use for this template,

00:07:05.030 --> 00:07:07.085
inside here as a string.

00:07:07.085 --> 00:07:09.064
Let's go for a medium,

00:07:09.064 --> 00:07:13.930
save this file, and then go to our blog.

00:07:15.290 --> 00:07:18.980
Which either these two images are now resized to be

00:07:18.980 --> 00:07:22.390
the medium setting which we just looked at in the dashboard.

00:07:22.390 --> 00:07:26.255
A second way of approaching this is via CSS,

00:07:26.255 --> 00:07:32.815
targeting a class WordPress ads to this image called WP post image.

00:07:32.815 --> 00:07:34.700
To say this in a fact,

00:07:34.700 --> 00:07:38.780
we can remove the medium setting from the post thumbnail,

00:07:38.780 --> 00:07:42.510
never go over to our style sheets in the side bar.

00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:45.500
Then outside the media query,

00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:49.110
we can target WP post image,

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:52.290
and then we can set a width value,

00:07:52.290 --> 00:07:55.380
I want to go for 75 percent,

00:07:55.380 --> 00:07:58.290
and let's see how this looks.

00:07:58.290 --> 00:08:03.270
Leaving each image to be 75 percent of the container width.

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:08.030
Of course, we can go even further using CSS by sending widths,

00:08:08.030 --> 00:08:13.519
heights, and using any of the power of CSS, have full control.

00:08:13.519 --> 00:08:15.860
However, doing too much with CSS,

00:08:15.860 --> 00:08:20.540
can need the images looking a little bit stretched or out proportion.

00:08:20.540 --> 00:08:27.180
So it's often best to keep image sizes consistent when uploading to avoid any problems.
