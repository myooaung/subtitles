00:00:01.220 --> 00:00:06.375
This is an optional video if you prefer to use a service called MAMP.

00:00:06.375 --> 00:00:09.210
Set up Wordpress on your own computer.

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:14.910
If you followed along successfully in the last video and setup WordPress using Flywheel,

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:19.615
then you can go ahead and skip this video and move on to the next section.

00:00:19.615 --> 00:00:23.969
If you prefer to use MAMP and you don't already have it installed,

00:00:23.969 --> 00:00:27.000
you'll need to go over to mamp.info,

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.940
and then click on the "Free Download. "

00:00:29.940 --> 00:00:34.310
MAMP is a local development environment which can

00:00:34.310 --> 00:00:37.985
be used on Mac and Windows and it provides us with

00:00:37.985 --> 00:00:41.780
a environment which will run PHP and also

00:00:41.780 --> 00:00:47.210
MySQL Database which is a requirement for using WordPress.

00:00:47.210 --> 00:00:52.910
The next step is to actually download WordPress from wordpress.org.

00:00:52.910 --> 00:00:57.845
Click on "Get WordPress" and then we can download the latest version,

00:00:57.845 --> 00:01:00.760
which is currently at 5.2.

00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.080
Downloading this is their a requirement if we are self

00:01:04.080 --> 00:01:08.340
hosting WordPress on our computer using MAMP.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:12.770
The next step, once MAMP has been downloaded is to

00:01:12.770 --> 00:01:17.500
go over to the MAMP folder and also open up the downloads.

00:01:17.500 --> 00:01:21.300
MAMP inside here will have an elephant icon.

00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:25.550
We can double click on this and open up the MAMP's start page.

00:01:25.550 --> 00:01:28.880
This is going to allow us to start the servers,

00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.425
and you see the two green lights at the top for the server and the database,

00:01:33.425 --> 00:01:36.055
then everything is running okay.

00:01:36.055 --> 00:01:39.254
Next up inside the MAMP directory,

00:01:39.254 --> 00:01:41.550
we have this htdocs folder,

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.080
and it's inside here where we add all of our projects.

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:49.925
I'm going to add our WordPress project into here in the downloads.

00:01:49.925 --> 00:01:56.325
I'm going to unzip the WordPress folder and then rename this,

00:01:56.325 --> 00:02:02.700
tranquilwp, hit "Enter" and now I can drag this over to the htdocs.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:05.460
If you're using a Mac,

00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:07.050
you may need to add a password in at

00:02:07.050 --> 00:02:11.920
this stage and then we can close both these windows down.

00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:17.270
The next step is to create a database for our WordPress projects.

00:02:17.270 --> 00:02:21.220
We can do this using MAMP from the web start page.

00:02:21.220 --> 00:02:23.345
If we click on this icon,

00:02:23.345 --> 00:02:27.110
go to Tools and then phpMyAdmin.

00:02:27.110 --> 00:02:31.895
From here we can create a new database from the database's tab.

00:02:31.895 --> 00:02:37.145
I'm going to call my database tranquil-spa with a hyphen.

00:02:37.145 --> 00:02:41.665
Click on "Create" and that's all done.

00:02:41.665 --> 00:02:45.090
The next step is to go to MAMP,

00:02:45.090 --> 00:02:48.790
double check which part where you're running on by clicking on "Preferences".

00:02:48.790 --> 00:02:51.595
I'm running on port 8888.

00:02:51.595 --> 00:02:56.850
All we need to do now is go to localhost 8888.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:03:02.360
It "Enter" and then we're taken to the contents of the htdocs.

00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.400
This will give us a link for the one and only project I have, which tranquilwp.

00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:09.675
If we select this,

00:03:09.675 --> 00:03:13.330
we're then taken to the WordPress installation scripts.

00:03:13.330 --> 00:03:16.645
Where we can begin by choosing our language.

00:03:16.645 --> 00:03:19.220
Click on "Continue."

00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:22.805
This stage tells us which requirements we will need

00:03:22.805 --> 00:03:25.760
such as a database username and password.

00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:27.500
We already have this all setup.

00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.910
We can click on "Let's Go."

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:40.865
The database name exactly as we did in phpMyAdmin was tranquil-spa, with the hyphen.

00:03:40.865 --> 00:03:43.730
We didn't set up add additional user.

00:03:43.730 --> 00:03:48.590
If we did, you'll need to add a username and password to your database.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:53.820
Otherwise we can just type in root and root for the password two.

00:03:53.820 --> 00:03:55.710
We're using a local host,

00:03:55.710 --> 00:04:01.925
and we can also optionally change the Table Prefix and let's change mine to tranquil_db.

00:04:01.925 --> 00:04:08.320
Then submit this. If you see this message,

00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:12.310
that means that everything has been now connected to our database,

00:04:12.310 --> 00:04:15.805
and we're ready to run the WordPress installation.

00:04:15.805 --> 00:04:18.245
This doesn't take too long to do.

00:04:18.245 --> 00:04:21.970
The WordPress installation needs to know the Site Title.

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:26.005
I want to call this the Tranquil Spa.

00:04:26.005 --> 00:04:30.010
This is the username and password which we're going to use to

00:04:30.010 --> 00:04:33.945
log in to the WordPress back-end or the WordPress dashboard.

00:04:33.945 --> 00:04:36.820
I want to call mine, tranquil_admin.

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.995
The password you can keep it as the generated one,

00:04:41.995 --> 00:04:45.110
or you can add a password of your choice.

00:04:46.940 --> 00:04:49.990
The email address,

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:59.440
and then complete the installation by clicking this button.

00:05:00.230 --> 00:05:05.740
Good, we're now ready to login using the username and password which we just created.

00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:11.095
Click on "Login" and we can enter these details into WordPress.

00:05:11.095 --> 00:05:20.080
So tranquil_admin, the password Remember me and then Login.

00:05:20.210 --> 00:05:24.700
Once we're logged will be taken to the WordPress dashboard,

00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:27.275
which is the admin area for our site.

00:05:27.275 --> 00:05:31.820
It will allow us to control things such as the pages, the posts.

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.575
We can upload any media.

00:05:33.575 --> 00:05:38.485
We can control comments and the settings and appearance of our site.

00:05:38.485 --> 00:05:42.110
We will go through these in more detail as we progress through the course.

00:05:42.110 --> 00:05:48.500
We can also view our site by hovering over Tranquil Spa and clicking 'Visit Site."

00:05:48.500 --> 00:05:51.760
This will then take us to the default theme.

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:56.630
You'll see something which looks like this once you reach this stage.

00:05:56.630 --> 00:05:58.820
If you need to get back to the dashboard,

00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:02.360
all you need to do is click on this site title or go down

00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:07.145
to the Dashboard link and this will take us back to the Dashboard.

00:06:07.145 --> 00:06:09.545
If you now reach this stage,

00:06:09.545 --> 00:06:13.790
this is WordPress all now setup on your computer and you can now

00:06:13.790 --> 00:06:19.440
progress to the next section where we will begin to build our WordPress site.
