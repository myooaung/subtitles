00:00:01.280 --> 00:00:05.760
Now, we've set up our strings in WordPress to be translatable.

00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:08.610
We now need some software to scan our code,

00:00:08.610 --> 00:00:11.190
extract, detect from a translatable,

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:12.620
and then it lists these words.

00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:16.110
We can actually translate to our desired language.

00:00:16.110 --> 00:00:20.175
This process is often referred to as localization.

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:21.615
To allow us to do this,

00:00:21.615 --> 00:00:24.824
I'm going to use a piece of software called Poedit,

00:00:24.824 --> 00:00:28.545
which is really popular and one I've used for many years.

00:00:28.545 --> 00:00:31.755
If you go to Google and search for Poedits,

00:00:31.755 --> 00:00:35.820
or you can go directly to Poedit.net.

00:00:35.820 --> 00:00:39.590
This is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:43.435
Click on the Free Download for your operating system.

00:00:43.435 --> 00:00:45.125
While it is downloading,

00:00:45.125 --> 00:00:48.980
remove any additional HTML files which you have in the sidebar,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.295
such as the contact on the blog, or HTML,

00:00:52.295 --> 00:00:57.620
since these HTML files are no longer needed in our project, once this is done,

00:00:57.620 --> 00:01:02.435
the next step is to create a new folder inside of the roots of the projects,

00:01:02.435 --> 00:01:05.330
and just call this folder languages.

00:01:05.330 --> 00:01:10.550
This is going to be the location where we're going to store our translated files.

00:01:10.550 --> 00:01:14.615
The next step is to go over to the functions.php,

00:01:14.615 --> 00:01:19.085
and we can tell WordPress where these languages folder is located.

00:01:19.085 --> 00:01:23.990
We do this with a function called load theme textdomain.

00:01:27.880 --> 00:01:31.505
Inside here we pass in two arguments.

00:01:31.505 --> 00:01:35.930
The third one is tranquil wp as our text domain.

00:01:35.930 --> 00:01:40.055
The second one is the location of this languages folder.

00:01:40.055 --> 00:01:43.100
We already know how to point to the roots of our directory,

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.420
we can do this with a function called get template directory.

00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.170
After this, we can then add onto the end with the dots,

00:01:54.170 --> 00:01:57.960
the string of /languages,

00:01:58.430 --> 00:02:00.890
semicolon at the end.

00:02:00.890 --> 00:02:05.930
Make sure that this file is saved and then we go back over to Poedit.

00:02:05.930 --> 00:02:08.915
Let's open up this as the ZIP,

00:02:08.915 --> 00:02:18.790
extract the contents, and then we can open up Poedits by double-clicking on this app.

00:02:21.290 --> 00:02:23.750
Once this is all installed,

00:02:23.750 --> 00:02:25.970
we then taken it to this welcome screen,

00:02:25.970 --> 00:02:30.830
and you may think we just click on the Translate WordPress theme plug-in link.

00:02:30.830 --> 00:02:34.100
But unfortunately, this is a paid option,

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:38.420
but don't worry, we can still do things manually using this free version.

00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:41.990
If you go to the options at the top of the screen and click on the "File",

00:02:41.990 --> 00:02:47.660
and then New, we then asked for the language we want to translate to.

00:02:47.660 --> 00:02:51.050
If you are not ready or unable to translate,

00:02:51.050 --> 00:02:55.625
don't worry, you can still select any language here for practice purposes.

00:02:55.625 --> 00:02:58.720
I want to use Spanish and then click "OK".

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.975
The next step is to save this file.

00:03:00.975 --> 00:03:04.200
Click on "File" and then "Save",

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:08.675
will then into save this in the location of our languages folder,

00:03:08.675 --> 00:03:13.070
mine is stored in the roots of my system as a user,

00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:15.685
then in local sites.

00:03:15.685 --> 00:03:19.695
Tranquilspa into the app section,

00:03:19.695 --> 00:03:22.155
and we need to go to wp content,

00:03:22.155 --> 00:03:25.275
themes, gravel theme folder,

00:03:25.275 --> 00:03:27.165
and then the languages folder,

00:03:27.165 --> 00:03:30.375
just here, click on "Save".

00:03:30.375 --> 00:03:31.980
If you're using MAMP,

00:03:31.980 --> 00:03:34.065
you will need to go into the HT docs,

00:03:34.065 --> 00:03:37.840
and then go through the wp content themes and so on.

00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.120
If you unsure where your theme is located,

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:46.800
you can go to local by flywheel and check out the file path at the top here.

00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.574
If we go back over to our text editor and then open sidebar,

00:03:51.574 --> 00:03:55.640
our languages folder we created now has two files.

00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:59.345
The name of ES, since this is a Spanish translation,

00:03:59.345 --> 00:04:01.775
and then we have a.mo file,

00:04:01.775 --> 00:04:04.100
which stands for machine object,

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.035
and then a.po file,

00:04:06.035 --> 00:04:07.910
which stands for portable object.

00:04:07.910 --> 00:04:10.850
These direct translation files which

00:04:10.850 --> 00:04:15.020
contain both the original text and also the translations,

00:04:15.020 --> 00:04:20.250
the only difference being the file format.po is a text file,

00:04:20.250 --> 00:04:24.425
and.mo is a binary file for computers.

00:04:24.425 --> 00:04:29.540
Don't worry about these too much since WordPress knows how to use both of them.

00:04:29.540 --> 00:04:33.065
Then back over to Poedit,

00:04:33.065 --> 00:04:35.390
back to the start screen.

00:04:35.390 --> 00:04:39.035
We can now extract the text strings from our theme.

00:04:39.035 --> 00:04:42.520
I would do this by clicking on "Extract from Sources",

00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:46.615
inside you will need to add the path to our theme folder.

00:04:46.615 --> 00:04:49.830
Click on this, Add Folders.

00:04:49.830 --> 00:04:54.030
I'm going to need to go to our location where our theme is stored,

00:04:54.030 --> 00:04:55.905
mine is in local sites,

00:04:55.905 --> 00:04:59.365
find this bar up, public,

00:04:59.365 --> 00:05:05.750
wp content, themes, tranquil wp, open this.

00:05:05.750 --> 00:05:09.470
Then we need to go over to the sources keywords tab,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:14.360
and here we need to tell Poedit how to find the text strings in our theme.

00:05:14.360 --> 00:05:18.465
The way it's going to find the translation text in our theme,

00:05:18.465 --> 00:05:20.700
it just scan through all of the code,

00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:23.180
and then it looks for the translation functions,

00:05:23.180 --> 00:05:24.950
which we are going to list here.

00:05:24.950 --> 00:05:28.370
The full list of these translation functions.

00:05:28.370 --> 00:05:31.580
We going to need developer.wordpress.org,

00:05:31.580 --> 00:05:35.215
and then take a look for the internationalization section.

00:05:35.215 --> 00:05:40.655
In the sidebar, we'll have a list of localization functions, which you can click on.

00:05:40.655 --> 00:05:44.615
We're basically going to be adding in all of these functions,

00:05:44.615 --> 00:05:50.770
which will tell Poedit to scan for all of this code and then find the strings inside.

00:05:50.770 --> 00:05:55.910
Let's go back over Poedits and we can go ahead and list all of these.

00:05:55.910 --> 00:05:58.745
The first one is the double underscores,

00:05:58.745 --> 00:06:00.740
we don't need to add the brackets.

00:06:00.740 --> 00:06:08.860
The next one is _e, _x, _ex,

00:06:08.860 --> 00:06:21.230
and _n, _nx, _n, _n_noop.

00:06:21.230 --> 00:06:27.500
After this, we have _nx_noop,

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:36.740
translate_nooped_plural, escape html, esc_html.

00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.180
The next one is escape_html_e.

00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:45.020
Once this is done we then click "OK",

00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.330
to extract all of the translation ready functions from our WordPress theme.

00:06:50.330 --> 00:06:55.890
Give us a few moments to go through and pull in all the contents which it needs.

00:06:55.940 --> 00:06:59.810
Once this is done, we get back a list of all the translates,

00:06:59.810 --> 00:07:01.520
both strings which we set,

00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:05.590
we can click on any of these such as "Spa facilities",

00:07:05.590 --> 00:07:09.110
then we get a recommendation off on the right-hand side.

00:07:09.110 --> 00:07:11.090
These are just recommendations.

00:07:11.090 --> 00:07:14.839
Be sure to double check these before using in production,

00:07:14.839 --> 00:07:16.460
we can click on this.

00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:20.050
This end populates the translation section at the bottom.

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:24.450
We can of course edit this ourselves and type in the translation directly,

00:07:24.450 --> 00:07:28.895
and all we need to do is go through each one of these and then translate.

00:07:28.895 --> 00:07:30.440
Once we're done with it,

00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:32.525
translates in all the words in our theme,

00:07:32.525 --> 00:07:34.085
we can then save this file,

00:07:34.085 --> 00:07:37.324
and this is then saved in its wild translation section,

00:07:37.324 --> 00:07:40.325
and it's available to load up into our theme.

00:07:40.325 --> 00:07:45.585
We can go through this multiple times too and save this for different languages.

00:07:45.585 --> 00:07:47.210
Once we are done with all these,

00:07:47.210 --> 00:07:48.650
we can save this file,

00:07:48.650 --> 00:07:52.230
and then we're left with our own theme translation.
