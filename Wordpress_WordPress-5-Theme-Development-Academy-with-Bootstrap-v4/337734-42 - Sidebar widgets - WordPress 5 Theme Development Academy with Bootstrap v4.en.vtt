00:00:00.310 --> 00:00:02.790
Welcome back. In this video,

00:00:02.790 --> 00:00:05.775
we're going to look at how we can widgetise our theme.

00:00:05.775 --> 00:00:11.115
This is the process of implementing widgets and also widget areas.

00:00:11.115 --> 00:00:17.010
These widgets are simply a self-contained area that performs a specific function.

00:00:17.010 --> 00:00:21.965
For example, we are going to create widgets for our sidebar in the blog section.

00:00:21.965 --> 00:00:23.730
We're going to create these blocks,

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:26.745
such as the archives and our categories.

00:00:26.745 --> 00:00:30.765
This makes it more customisable for the administrator,

00:00:30.765 --> 00:00:33.090
since widgets can be moved around,

00:00:33.090 --> 00:00:35.385
added or even removed.

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:40.589
If we go over to our dashboard and then down to the appearance,

00:00:40.589 --> 00:00:42.625
if you hover over this,

00:00:42.625 --> 00:00:48.050
this is normally where we can find the widgets option but it's not there.

00:00:48.050 --> 00:00:49.710
To see this option,

00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:52.200
first we need to setup our widget areas.

00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.510
In our case, the sidebar.

00:00:54.510 --> 00:01:01.410
If we go over to the codex on the WordPress website and search for widgeitising themes,

00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:06.785
the first thing we see is how to actually register a new widget area.

00:01:06.785 --> 00:01:11.055
We do this with a function called Register sidebar.

00:01:11.055 --> 00:01:13.410
This function is customisable,

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:17.965
so we can use the same elements and classes we already have in our sidebar,

00:01:17.965 --> 00:01:21.450
to preserve the bootstrap appearance and layout.

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:25.360
We do this by changing any IDs and classes or

00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:30.355
the title and also the widget area to match our current sidebar.

00:01:30.355 --> 00:01:33.315
Let's begin by copying this section,

00:01:33.315 --> 00:01:36.255
everything except the PHP tags.

00:01:36.255 --> 00:01:38.835
This is going into the function's.PHP,

00:01:38.835 --> 00:01:42.925
so we don't need to add these since we already have them included.

00:01:42.925 --> 00:01:50.295
Let's open up the functions and then right down at the very bottom, paste this in.

00:01:50.295 --> 00:01:53.250
Still within the PHP tags,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.145
if we open up the sidebar.PHP,

00:01:57.145 --> 00:02:00.785
we see that each section is surrounded with a div

00:02:00.785 --> 00:02:04.990
with the class or padding on the y-axis or the value of free.

00:02:04.990 --> 00:02:07.935
Let's go and add this in the functions.

00:02:07.935 --> 00:02:11.690
We can do this with div before and after widget section.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:13.595
We already have a div in place,

00:02:13.595 --> 00:02:16.935
so all we need to do is to add a class.

00:02:16.935 --> 00:02:21.365
This is our PY-free class.

00:02:21.365 --> 00:02:25.100
We already have the closing div, so that's fine.

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:28.580
Next we can work with the title.

00:02:28.580 --> 00:02:30.470
Again in the side bar,

00:02:30.470 --> 00:02:34.660
this is a level four heading in with a class of font itallic.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:43.420
So first of all, we can change the h_2 to be h_4 and also the class to be font itallic.

00:02:43.780 --> 00:02:48.290
Then down at the bottom we have an action just like we've seen before,

00:02:48.290 --> 00:02:53.035
which will run our function after the widgets in it's hook.

00:02:53.035 --> 00:02:58.115
Now, if we go back over to the codex and scroll down to the next area,

00:02:58.115 --> 00:03:02.695
this is how to actually display our new widgets area.

00:03:02.695 --> 00:03:07.249
We do this with a WordPress function called dynamic sidebar,

00:03:07.249 --> 00:03:12.755
which will create these sidebar photos by calling all of the active widgets.

00:03:12.755 --> 00:03:15.810
Let's copy this example.

00:03:16.490 --> 00:03:19.735
Then in the sidebar.PHP,

00:03:19.735 --> 00:03:23.220
we can add this at the very top of the file.

00:03:24.050 --> 00:03:30.200
Here we're targeting our home right one section and in the functions,

00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:34.285
this has the same ID were added into this array.

00:03:34.285 --> 00:03:39.830
Now if we go over to our dashboard and then reload this,

00:03:39.830 --> 00:03:44.815
over our appearance, we now have a widgets option, which we can click on.

00:03:44.815 --> 00:03:49.259
This now has our new widgets area of home right sidebar,

00:03:49.259 --> 00:03:52.875
which is the one we just registered inside of functions.

00:03:52.875 --> 00:03:55.190
Then we can go ahead and drag over any of

00:03:55.190 --> 00:03:59.165
these available WordPress widgets into our sidebar.

00:03:59.165 --> 00:04:02.715
Wordpress provides us this with lots of different widgets.

00:04:02.715 --> 00:04:05.480
We already have the archives which we are going to use.

00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:07.625
We can drag in calendars,

00:04:07.625 --> 00:04:09.695
we can drag an image galleries,

00:04:09.695 --> 00:04:11.690
also creating custom HTML,

00:04:11.690 --> 00:04:13.060
which we're going to do.

00:04:13.060 --> 00:04:15.540
We can construct menus, pages,

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:18.655
comments and pretty much anything that we can think of.

00:04:18.655 --> 00:04:22.159
We're going to begin at the top of our sidebar.

00:04:22.159 --> 00:04:24.665
Lets go to our sidebar.PHP.

00:04:24.665 --> 00:04:27.725
We're going to create this section as a widget.

00:04:27.725 --> 00:04:29.900
It is going to be the about section,

00:04:29.900 --> 00:04:32.500
with the text inside here.

00:04:32.500 --> 00:04:34.845
So let's go to the dashboard.

00:04:34.845 --> 00:04:38.370
We can do this with a custom HTML widget.

00:04:38.370 --> 00:04:41.380
The title was about.

00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:49.595
Now we can add our custom HTML by copying over this P element from our sidebar,

00:04:49.595 --> 00:04:52.295
paste this into the contents,

00:04:52.295 --> 00:04:58.040
"Save" and now I'm going to open up our site in a new tab.

00:04:58.640 --> 00:05:04.185
Go to the blog section and we have two of our sections,

00:05:04.185 --> 00:05:10.425
one now generated from our sidebar.PHP and over generated as a widget.

00:05:10.425 --> 00:05:13.270
We'll keep both of these in place for now just to compare

00:05:13.270 --> 00:05:18.160
these styling but next we're going to move on to the archive section.

00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.670
The archive section also has its own widgets,

00:05:21.670 --> 00:05:23.870
so this is pretty straightforward.

00:05:23.870 --> 00:05:27.115
We can drag this over below our about section.

00:05:27.115 --> 00:05:30.220
We don't need to add a title since the widget name

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:33.670
of archives will appear as the title by default.

00:05:33.670 --> 00:05:38.850
So all we need to do is to reload and now have an archive section.

00:05:38.850 --> 00:05:44.155
The CSS looks a little bit different but we'll come back to this in just a moment.

00:05:44.155 --> 00:05:46.900
Next, we can drag over the categories,

00:05:46.900 --> 00:05:50.485
which is also a widget provided by WordPress,

00:05:50.485 --> 00:05:58.140
drag this over below the archives and our categories now appear.

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:02.075
The last section is the following section down at the bottom.

00:06:02.075 --> 00:06:05.320
Again, this needs to be some custom HTML.

00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:10.830
If we go down to our sidebars.PHP to the follow a section,

00:06:10.830 --> 00:06:13.830
we can copy all of the i elements from

00:06:13.830 --> 00:06:19.415
font-awesome and then we can create a new widgets area,

00:06:19.415 --> 00:06:21.620
which is custom HTML,

00:06:21.620 --> 00:06:23.885
drop this in at the bottom.

00:06:23.885 --> 00:06:32.950
The title was follow us based in the HTML and then save this file.

00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:40.065
There we go. The next step which I'm going to add is a search box.

00:06:40.065 --> 00:06:42.440
This search facility isn't currently part of

00:06:42.440 --> 00:06:47.495
our bootstrap templates but since WordPress provides this as an easy to use widget,

00:06:47.495 --> 00:06:49.925
it makes sense to add one of these in,

00:06:49.925 --> 00:06:54.880
I want to drag this over just below our about section.

00:06:54.880 --> 00:07:01.850
Add this in and refresh the browser and we have a search box now as a widget.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:04.940
If we do a search, let's search for Lorem,

00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:09.034
you'll find all of our blog posts with word Lorem inside.

00:07:09.034 --> 00:07:12.770
Let's try number five for blog posts five.

00:07:12.770 --> 00:07:17.585
This works because we have our blog posts and the 1500s in there.

00:07:17.585 --> 00:07:20.154
Let's try offers.

00:07:20.154 --> 00:07:23.340
We got no post matching our criteria.

00:07:23.340 --> 00:07:27.845
We will come back to this very soon when we create our own custom search box,

00:07:27.845 --> 00:07:30.320
so for now I'm going to move on to the style in

00:07:30.320 --> 00:07:33.220
for the archives and the category section,

00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.305
just to make this look like our existing sidebar,

00:07:36.305 --> 00:07:39.715
let's open up our customers style.css.

00:07:39.715 --> 00:07:43.760
We need to go down to the bottom of our regular styles,

00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.890
outside of our media query,

00:07:45.890 --> 00:07:48.740
we can target the widget area,

00:07:48.740 --> 00:07:52.160
which is a class added in by WordPress.

00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:55.985
We're then going to target any unordered lists inside of a div.

00:07:55.985 --> 00:08:02.430
We can remove the bullet points with list style and set this to be a value of none.

00:08:02.620 --> 00:08:07.870
After this, we can also reset the padding to be a value of zero.

00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:11.450
Save this file, which leaves

00:08:11.450 --> 00:08:16.385
our new widgets area looking just like the existing bootstrap sidebar.

00:08:16.385 --> 00:08:18.740
So if we go over to our sidebar,

00:08:18.740 --> 00:08:21.365
we don't need any of these sections anymore,

00:08:21.365 --> 00:08:24.710
so we're going to move all of the divs, in fact,

00:08:24.710 --> 00:08:32.045
all of the code outside of the PHP section and now we should have one sidebar on its own.

00:08:32.045 --> 00:08:34.820
Next, we're going to customize our search form,

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:36.325
which we added as a widget,

00:08:36.325 --> 00:08:39.680
so we fit in with the rest of our theme.
