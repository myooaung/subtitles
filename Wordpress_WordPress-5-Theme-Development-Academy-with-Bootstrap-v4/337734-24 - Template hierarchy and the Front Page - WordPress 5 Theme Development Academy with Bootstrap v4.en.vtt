00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:05.520
We now move on to create in at the front page of our theme.

00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:08.250
You may be thinking, have we not already got

00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:11.130
our homepage displaying? Yes, you are correct.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:12.615
When we visit the theme,

00:00:12.615 --> 00:00:15.870
we see the contents of the index dot PHP.

00:00:15.870 --> 00:00:17.760
This is basically because,

00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.209
since we've now created a suitable home page templates,

00:00:21.209 --> 00:00:25.470
WordPress will default back to our index dot PHP.

00:00:25.470 --> 00:00:27.645
To better understand how this works,

00:00:27.645 --> 00:00:29.130
let's go to Google,

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:32.924
and search for the WordPress templates hierarchy.

00:00:32.924 --> 00:00:36.315
This is the link we need right over the top.

00:00:36.315 --> 00:00:42.520
Templates with WordPress uses can be reusable files to display our web pages.

00:00:42.520 --> 00:00:45.770
We've already used the header and footer templates,

00:00:45.770 --> 00:00:48.290
which we've reused across our theme.

00:00:48.290 --> 00:00:52.580
However, not all templates needs to be used across the whole of our theme.

00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:56.915
We can create page templates to only display some pages,

00:00:56.915 --> 00:01:01.210
or even use conditional rendering control when we use them.

00:01:01.210 --> 00:01:06.540
Let's scroll down to the template hierarchy in detail section,

00:01:06.770 --> 00:01:09.585
and this is the section just here.

00:01:09.585 --> 00:01:12.680
We're about find out that at its most basic,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:18.575
WordPress uses a hierarchy system to decide which template controls which page.

00:01:18.575 --> 00:01:22.880
But the moment this is pretty easy since we've only really got the index

00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:27.470
dot PHP puts us our theme grows, which you will soon.

00:01:27.470 --> 00:01:30.395
We need to be aware of the order of selection,

00:01:30.395 --> 00:01:34.465
which is used as we have more available page templates.

00:01:34.465 --> 00:01:39.650
We're going to be using the index dot PHP file to display our blog posts,

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:42.274
which is pretty common in WordPress,

00:01:42.274 --> 00:01:45.305
and then create a new from page templates.

00:01:45.305 --> 00:01:47.570
If you go to Home page display,

00:01:47.570 --> 00:01:50.135
which you see here, by default,

00:01:50.135 --> 00:01:55.175
WordPress will set the sides homepage to display the latest blog posts.

00:01:55.175 --> 00:01:58.745
Obviously, we don't have any blog posts just yet,

00:01:58.745 --> 00:02:00.920
and we'll look at change the theme.

00:02:00.920 --> 00:02:04.970
It will first look for a home dot PHP templates.

00:02:04.970 --> 00:02:06.860
If this is not found,

00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:10.225
it will default back to the index dot PHP.

00:02:10.225 --> 00:02:13.820
The key thing to remember here is our blog posts will default

00:02:13.820 --> 00:02:18.130
back index page if no more suitable page is found.

00:02:18.130 --> 00:02:20.910
Is then any note just below which says

00:02:20.910 --> 00:02:24.755
the front page dot PHP will override both of these,

00:02:24.755 --> 00:02:28.520
and this is a file which will be creating next for our Homepage.

00:02:28.520 --> 00:02:32.315
If we scroll down, we can now see the front page dot PHP.

00:02:32.315 --> 00:02:36.620
This front page dot PHP is used to render the sides from page,

00:02:36.620 --> 00:02:39.535
and this is exactly what we are going to be using it for.

00:02:39.535 --> 00:02:42.855
If the front page dot PHP cannot be found,

00:02:42.855 --> 00:02:46.415
we will then look for a secondary home dot PHP.

00:02:46.415 --> 00:02:48.560
After this, if this page cannot be found,

00:02:48.560 --> 00:02:50.749
we will then look for the page dot PHP,

00:02:50.749 --> 00:02:53.615
and then finally the index dot PHP.

00:02:53.615 --> 00:02:55.250
If we scroll down even further,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:58.430
the templates we can use for the single post,

00:02:58.430 --> 00:03:02.805
a single page, different categories, and lots more.

00:03:02.805 --> 00:03:05.890
We'll make use of many of these throughout the course,

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:10.745
but this page is always a good reference if you need to understand how things work.

00:03:10.745 --> 00:03:14.600
Now let's get to work on creating the front page templates.

00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:17.320
If we go over to the dashboard,

00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:20.290
by clicking the top corner here,

00:03:20.290 --> 00:03:25.205
we can create a new page by going to our pages link and then add new.

00:03:25.205 --> 00:03:28.910
This is where we create any pages for our theme,

00:03:28.910 --> 00:03:31.690
would start by creating the homepage,

00:03:31.690 --> 00:03:34.445
and then click on publish at the top.

00:03:34.445 --> 00:03:37.280
We can now get to work on moving the contents of

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:41.285
our index dot PHP onto the from page file.

00:03:41.285 --> 00:03:46.815
Let's duplicates or copy and paste the index dot PHP,

00:03:46.815 --> 00:03:51.090
and then we can rename this the front page dot PHP.

00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:58.235
Since our index page is no longer going to be used for our from page,

00:03:58.235 --> 00:04:03.590
we can remove all the content from in between the header and the footer.

00:04:03.590 --> 00:04:06.660
Delete all the sections,

00:04:07.100 --> 00:04:09.945
leaving just the header and footer.

00:04:09.945 --> 00:04:13.655
We can check if this is working okay by visiting the sites,

00:04:13.655 --> 00:04:17.314
and we still see all the sections of our homepage.

00:04:17.314 --> 00:04:20.915
Why do we still see all the contents of our homepage?

00:04:20.915 --> 00:04:25.330
Well, this is because we now have a more specific templates or front page,

00:04:25.330 --> 00:04:28.265
and it now has all the contents that we need.

00:04:28.265 --> 00:04:31.685
We will come back to this index page in the next section,

00:04:31.685 --> 00:04:35.045
where we'll use this to render out our blog posts.

00:04:35.045 --> 00:04:38.899
The next thing to do is to go over to the dashboard,

00:04:38.899 --> 00:04:41.135
and here down in the settings.

00:04:41.135 --> 00:04:44.240
Then in reading, we can set which page you want to display

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:47.690
it for the homepage and also for all blog posts.

00:04:47.690 --> 00:04:51.145
Our homepage will display a static page.

00:04:51.145 --> 00:04:54.865
This is going to be the homepage which we created before.

00:04:54.865 --> 00:04:58.500
Save changes, and now we're good to go.

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.050
We can double-check if everything is clean from

00:05:01.050 --> 00:05:05.135
our front page templates by just adding anything into here.

00:05:05.135 --> 00:05:07.975
I changed welcome strangles bar.

00:05:07.975 --> 00:05:10.440
That's of enough to hear,

00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:16.100
also front page, and that's our text here coming from the front page.

00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:19.220
Good, so that's our front page now setup and our

00:05:19.220 --> 00:05:22.220
first we'll look at custom page templates.

00:05:22.220 --> 00:05:25.625
Next will move back over to the index dot PHP.

00:05:25.625 --> 00:05:27.785
We will create the WordPress loop,

00:05:27.785 --> 00:05:30.420
and display our blog posts.
