00:00:00.950 --> 00:00:06.120
Sticking with the theme of allowing the end user to make customizations,

00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:09.150
without needing to dive into our Bootstrap code.

00:00:09.150 --> 00:00:13.680
Custom headers is also something we can set up to help this.

00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:18.330
You can find this page by searching for WordPress custom headers.

00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:23.850
Custom headers is an image when an ad at the top of the header section of our theme,

00:00:23.850 --> 00:00:27.150
basically where we already have our lake image,

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:29.205
which is this background here.

00:00:29.205 --> 00:00:33.885
Well, this time the user can select their own image from the dashboard.

00:00:33.885 --> 00:00:36.930
Doing this is pretty straight forward.

00:00:36.930 --> 00:00:41.075
We enable this feature by using the add theme support function,

00:00:41.075 --> 00:00:43.775
which we used earlier for the title tag.

00:00:43.775 --> 00:00:46.235
Passing in some arguments.

00:00:46.235 --> 00:00:48.320
These arguments are going to be an array,

00:00:48.320 --> 00:00:50.165
just like you see on here.

00:00:50.165 --> 00:00:54.545
He will have arguments such as the width, the height,

00:00:54.545 --> 00:00:57.050
the default image, location,

00:00:57.050 --> 00:01:01.555
the default color, and also if this is to be a flexible image.

00:01:01.555 --> 00:01:05.145
We can add this over in the functions.php.

00:01:05.145 --> 00:01:07.425
Let's head over to that now,

00:01:07.425 --> 00:01:10.720
and then down at the bottom of our file.

00:01:10.720 --> 00:01:13.555
Just after this nav menu filter,

00:01:13.555 --> 00:01:18.080
we're going to add in an array of arguments which we can pass in.

00:01:18.080 --> 00:01:19.985
Let's create an array,

00:01:19.985 --> 00:01:24.805
with the variable name of args service be a PHP array.

00:01:24.805 --> 00:01:26.920
Then inside here as a string,

00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.620
we're going to begin by setting the width.

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:32.785
Then just like we looked at earlier with the arrow,

00:01:32.785 --> 00:01:39.790
we can then set this to a value of 2,600 pixels separated by comma.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:43.660
The next one I'm going to add is for the height.

00:01:43.660 --> 00:01:49.240
This is setup in exactly the same way with value of 650.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:52.920
Next we are going to add a default image.

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:55.920
If no over is selected,

00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.605
this needs to be a file path.

00:01:58.605 --> 00:02:00.374
To get our directory,

00:02:00.374 --> 00:02:03.785
we can use get template directory URI,

00:02:03.785 --> 00:02:06.350
which we used early on for our style sheets,

00:02:06.350 --> 00:02:09.725
and I was gripped this is a function.

00:02:09.725 --> 00:02:12.950
We can then add onto the end of this the rest of the file path,

00:02:12.950 --> 00:02:15.170
which is the images folder.

00:02:15.170 --> 00:02:18.730
Then we can grab the.jpeg,

00:02:18.730 --> 00:02:22.265
which is the default image you have at the minute.

00:02:22.265 --> 00:02:26.315
The final one I'm going to add is for the uploads.

00:02:26.315 --> 00:02:29.630
Set to true will allow the end user to upload

00:02:29.630 --> 00:02:34.420
your own images in the dashboard semicolon at the end here.

00:02:34.420 --> 00:02:41.370
Then we need to register our custom headers functionality with the themes power function.

00:02:42.210 --> 00:02:45.100
Just like when we use this function earlier,

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:47.650
this takes in a string which will pass in

00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:50.800
the name of the functionality we want to enable.

00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:52.915
In our case it's custom header.

00:02:52.915 --> 00:02:54.820
Then as a second argument,

00:02:54.820 --> 00:02:57.280
we can also pass in the arguments array,

00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.485
which we just created above.

00:02:59.485 --> 00:03:03.885
Semicolon at the end gives a file save.

00:03:03.885 --> 00:03:06.790
Then next we can set where we want this header image to

00:03:06.790 --> 00:03:12.130
display which is currently inside of our header.php file.

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:14.990
Let's open up this file,

00:03:14.990 --> 00:03:19.790
and then we need to replace the image source for the Lake.

00:03:19.850 --> 00:03:22.690
Let's take a look for this,

00:03:22.690 --> 00:03:25.940
which is the image source just here.

00:03:27.420 --> 00:03:29.955
We can remove this,

00:03:29.955 --> 00:03:33.230
and then inside here we can replace the image source

00:03:33.230 --> 00:03:37.410
with a WordPress function called header image,

00:03:40.750 --> 00:03:47.025
with the underscore in between the brackets and then the semicolon.

00:03:47.025 --> 00:03:51.245
We're now ready to test this out over in the dashboard.

00:03:51.245 --> 00:03:54.320
Let's head over to there and then if we go into

00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.255
the customizer will appearance and then customize.

00:03:58.255 --> 00:04:02.375
We should now have a option called header image.

00:04:02.375 --> 00:04:06.665
Click on Next and we now see the default image which we set,

00:04:06.665 --> 00:04:08.960
notices the recommended size,

00:04:08.960 --> 00:04:11.165
which we also set in the functions.

00:04:11.165 --> 00:04:13.834
This is now output in the customizer.

00:04:13.834 --> 00:04:17.030
Here we can go ahead and change the header image,

00:04:17.030 --> 00:04:19.130
even uploading new ones.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:21.455
Since we said the upload to be true,

00:04:21.455 --> 00:04:26.485
let's just quickly grab a different image and you want to raise is fine.

00:04:26.485 --> 00:04:28.280
You know it's not the right size,

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.295
will just select this one for now.

00:04:30.295 --> 00:04:33.980
Therefore, we can see the new image in the background.

00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:35.480
Before we move on though,

00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:37.580
I want to show you one more thing.

00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:41.395
This is how we can set up an array of default headers.

00:04:41.395 --> 00:04:44.930
Signing this app will allow the user inside

00:04:44.930 --> 00:04:49.560
this customizer to just click on any of the images which we provide them,

00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.285
and change it at the click of a button.

00:04:52.285 --> 00:04:56.820
We do this, just after our custom header which will be setup.

00:04:56.820 --> 00:04:59.555
Back over to our functions.

00:04:59.555 --> 00:05:02.435
Just below add theme support.

00:05:02.435 --> 00:05:07.560
We can use a function called register default headers.

00:05:08.810 --> 00:05:12.360
This also passes in an array.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:15.410
This array is going to contain all the different values of

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:19.870
the images which you want to make available in the customizer.

00:05:19.870 --> 00:05:23.020
The first one is going to be like one.

00:05:23.020 --> 00:05:25.535
This is the name which will give the image.

00:05:25.535 --> 00:05:29.690
This will be an array of values where we'll pass in the URL,

00:05:29.690 --> 00:05:31.995
which is the location of the image,

00:05:31.995 --> 00:05:34.030
a thumbnail we want to display,

00:05:34.030 --> 00:05:36.530
and also a description.

00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.170
First of all, let's pass in the URL.

00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.040
This is a similar setup to just above.

00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.145
We can add the get template directory URI,

00:05:49.145 --> 00:05:52.995
which is going to point to our image.

00:05:52.995 --> 00:05:56.005
This is in the Images folder,

00:05:56.005 --> 00:05:59.485
and this is Lake.jpeg.

00:05:59.485 --> 00:06:03.860
This is our first header image which we could using.

00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:06.425
This is the original like image,

00:06:06.425 --> 00:06:10.015
and they also have provided a second image to select two.

00:06:10.015 --> 00:06:15.139
Before we do this, let's also set the thumbnail URL.

00:06:15.810 --> 00:06:19.510
You can create a thumbnail version is if you like.

00:06:19.510 --> 00:06:24.945
Both use the same location and passes in.

00:06:24.945 --> 00:06:29.000
The third one is going to be for the description.

00:06:29.190 --> 00:06:34.400
We'll wrap this inside of a function so it's translatable later on.

00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.900
Lake one is fine.

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:39.760
I've also provided a Lake two image.

00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:42.835
So I'm going to copy this first array item.

00:06:42.835 --> 00:06:44.830
Basis just below.

00:06:44.830 --> 00:06:46.300
Now needs to do is change,

00:06:46.300 --> 00:06:48.740
each one needs to be Lake two,

00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:53.295
and also the description.

00:06:53.295 --> 00:06:56.230
This Lake two is also in the Images folder,

00:06:56.230 --> 00:06:58.955
and this is this image is here.

00:06:58.955 --> 00:07:01.850
Now save the functions file.

00:07:01.850 --> 00:07:07.140
Let's add a semicolon at the very end over to the customizer,

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:12.420
and let's reload this into the header image.

00:07:12.420 --> 00:07:16.745
Now we'll see our two suggested images down at the bottom.

00:07:16.745 --> 00:07:19.415
The user can now click on any of these images.

00:07:19.415 --> 00:07:22.160
All upload a new one of their choosing.

00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:24.395
That's it now for our custom headers,

00:07:24.395 --> 00:07:27.450
and I will see you in the next video.
