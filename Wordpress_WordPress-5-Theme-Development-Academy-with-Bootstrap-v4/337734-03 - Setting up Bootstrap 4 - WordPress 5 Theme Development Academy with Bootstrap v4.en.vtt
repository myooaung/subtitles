00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:04.395
Welcome to the Bootstrap section of this course.

00:00:04.395 --> 00:00:08.835
This is where we kick things off with creating our custom theme.

00:00:08.835 --> 00:00:14.655
This section is all about creating a static HTML and CSS websites.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:19.450
Hamel created exactly how we want our Wordpress theme to look.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:22.799
However, don't worry about WordPress at the moment,

00:00:22.799 --> 00:00:27.285
which is billed this as we would do with any normal HTML websites.

00:00:27.285 --> 00:00:32.065
Then we handle the conversion to WordPress in a later section.

00:00:32.065 --> 00:00:35.520
The first thing we need to do is to grab the Bootstrap core,

00:00:35.520 --> 00:00:38.160
CSS and JavaScript files.

00:00:38.160 --> 00:00:42.435
To do this, we need head over to get bootstrap.com.

00:00:42.435 --> 00:00:46.610
This will take us to the version four of Bootstrap.

00:00:46.610 --> 00:00:48.880
I'm using version 4.3,

00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.805
and I would recommend you use the same if possible.

00:00:51.805 --> 00:00:53.380
To get started with Bootstrap,

00:00:53.380 --> 00:00:58.105
I'm going to go over to the documentation in the introduction section.

00:00:58.105 --> 00:01:01.120
On here we have some Quickstart links,

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:03.895
we have a CDN link for the CSS,

00:01:03.895 --> 00:01:06.280
and also the JavaScript.

00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.435
Then below this we have a starter template for our index page,

00:01:10.435 --> 00:01:13.040
and we'll come back and grab this soon.

00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:17.020
Although I'm going to click on the download button from the menu,

00:01:17.020 --> 00:01:20.740
and then click on the compiled CSS and JavaScript link,

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:24.050
and then starts off the download with this button here.

00:01:24.050 --> 00:01:28.340
Obvious in this compiled CSS and JavaScript download,

00:01:28.340 --> 00:01:31.070
which we'll get started really quickly.

00:01:31.070 --> 00:01:35.095
Once this is done, we can click on the package and unzip.

00:01:35.095 --> 00:01:39.465
Once this is unzipped, I'm going to move this over to the desktop.

00:01:39.465 --> 00:01:41.810
Let's drag this over,

00:01:41.810 --> 00:01:44.075
and then I'm going to rename this.

00:01:44.075 --> 00:01:47.730
The name I'm going to call this is tranquil-bs.

00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:52.820
This is for the tranquil boost up version of our project.

00:01:52.820 --> 00:01:55.460
Later will create a tranquil-wp,

00:01:55.460 --> 00:01:58.615
which is for our Wordpress conversion.

00:01:58.615 --> 00:02:01.805
The next thing we want to do is to grab the images.

00:02:01.805 --> 00:02:04.070
The images are included with this course.

00:02:04.070 --> 00:02:06.800
Go ahead and grab those if you haven't done that yet,

00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:09.775
and then drag this over into our folder.

00:02:09.775 --> 00:02:12.700
I would have Visual Studio Code open here,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:16.360
and you can use any text editor which you like for this course.

00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:20.805
To get started in VS Code we just need to drag over our project folder,

00:02:20.805 --> 00:02:24.815
and then this will open up with the contents in cyber.

00:02:24.815 --> 00:02:30.110
It's compiled version uses various CSS and JavaScript files.

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:34.835
I'm just going to be using the bootstrap.min.css for this course.

00:02:34.835 --> 00:02:38.735
Which is a minified version of the main CSS,

00:02:38.735 --> 00:02:43.315
which includes the available Bootstrap layouts and components we need.

00:02:43.315 --> 00:02:46.200
There is also different versions too,

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:50.929
if you want to make use of the CSS grid or Bootstrap's reboots,

00:02:50.929 --> 00:02:53.510
and you can find out more about what's included in

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.715
these files in the Bootstrap documentation, if you would like.

00:02:57.715 --> 00:03:00.800
Next up we have the JavaScript folder,

00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.570
which is right at the buttom here.

00:03:02.570 --> 00:03:04.730
The same goes for the JavaScript,

00:03:04.730 --> 00:03:09.985
I'm only going to be using the main bootstrap.min.js file.

00:03:09.985 --> 00:03:14.665
Then of course we have the images which is supplied for this course.

00:03:14.665 --> 00:03:18.855
You will also know that is no index.html file.

00:03:18.855 --> 00:03:20.280
This is not provided,

00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:22.665
so we need to go and create one ourselves,

00:03:22.665 --> 00:03:25.380
in the roots of this project.

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:33.330
In the main route, let's click on new file and let's create our index.html.

00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:38.600
If we go back to the browser and then back into the introduction section.

00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:42.080
We can now copy the starter templates that we looked up before,

00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.790
you can however select all and copy,

00:03:43.790 --> 00:03:46.855
or you can just click on the copy button in the top corner.

00:03:46.855 --> 00:03:50.180
Copy this and then over to our index.html.

00:03:50.180 --> 00:03:52.400
We can now paste this in.

00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:55.580
First of all, we have the Bootstrap CSS,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:57.995
which is up in the head section.

00:03:57.995 --> 00:04:00.200
This basic starter kit points to

00:04:00.200 --> 00:04:06.575
the CSS and JavaScript files we need from bootstrap and these hosted on CDN.

00:04:06.575 --> 00:04:08.710
You can see by these links here.

00:04:08.710 --> 00:04:13.895
Let's change this to point to our local files which we added into our project,

00:04:13.895 --> 00:04:16.595
starting with the Bootstrap CSS.

00:04:16.595 --> 00:04:21.340
In the href, we can remove this and then we can point this

00:04:21.340 --> 00:04:27.230
to our CSS folder, css/bootstrap.min.css.

00:04:30.980 --> 00:04:35.310
Down below, we can then look at our JavaScripts,

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:38.740
scroll down to the very bottom in the script sections,

00:04:38.740 --> 00:04:40.910
we have three different scripts here.

00:04:40.910 --> 00:04:43.200
First of all, we have jQuery,

00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:47.320
which we can leave it for now since we don't have this installed in our project.

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:50.830
We can also remove the Popper.js,

00:04:50.830 --> 00:04:53.485
which is the middle script just here.

00:04:53.485 --> 00:04:56.235
This is not needed for our projects,

00:04:56.235 --> 00:05:00.020
and this is only required for certain Bootstrap components,

00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:03.640
such as when using tooltips and dropped down links.

00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:06.740
However, if you do intend to customize the template,

00:05:06.740 --> 00:05:10.025
recreates, make use of these, you can of course,

00:05:10.025 --> 00:05:12.790
leave this in, then we need to change

00:05:12.790 --> 00:05:16.765
the core Bootstrap JS file to point to our local file.

00:05:16.765 --> 00:05:20.465
If we remove the source here on this CDN link,

00:05:20.465 --> 00:05:28.465
then changes to our JavaScript folder and the file we want is bootstrap.min.js.

00:05:28.465 --> 00:05:32.864
Along with the core bootstrap CSS we've been provided,

00:05:32.864 --> 00:05:35.735
we also want to add our own custom styling.

00:05:35.735 --> 00:05:39.080
To override any of the default Bootstrap styles,

00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:42.335
which we can deal with a custom CSS file.

00:05:42.335 --> 00:05:44.255
Back in the sidebar,

00:05:44.255 --> 00:05:47.885
in the CSS folder and create a new file,

00:05:47.885 --> 00:05:51.715
and it's called Custom.css.

00:05:51.715 --> 00:05:57.610
Would lead to then link this in the index.html to points to this new file.

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:02.690
Open at the top, we're going to add this just after the core Bootstrap CSS.

00:06:02.690 --> 00:06:06.860
Let's add a comment of Custom CSS.

00:06:06.860 --> 00:06:09.355
We can then add our link.

00:06:09.355 --> 00:06:15.060
This style sheet is a style sheets and href points to our CSS folder,

00:06:15.060 --> 00:06:18.705
and the name was custom.css.

00:06:18.705 --> 00:06:21.709
As with any over website project,

00:06:21.709 --> 00:06:24.940
we should include our own custom stylesheets last.

00:06:24.940 --> 00:06:30.670
They will then be loaded last and override any of the stylesheets above if required.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:33.995
In our case, the custom Bootstrap CSS.

00:06:33.995 --> 00:06:39.090
The last thing to do is to change this page title to be tranquil spa.

00:06:40.610 --> 00:06:42.930
We can give this file a save,

00:06:42.930 --> 00:06:45.465
I'm going go to the index.html,

00:06:45.465 --> 00:06:50.500
copy the path, and then paste this into a new browser tab,

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:51.965
to open this up.

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:54.860
You can also go into your project folder and

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.360
double-click on the index page to be taken to this,

00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:00.440
and now we see the Hello World text,

00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.525
which is from our sample code,

00:07:02.525 --> 00:07:04.645
which is h1 just here.

00:07:04.645 --> 00:07:07.650
That's it now for our project setup.

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:10.925
I will see you now in the next video where we'll begin

00:07:10.925 --> 00:07:15.600
customizing our theme by adding Google Fonts.
