1
00:00:03,937 --> 00:00:06,918
Any questions on Google Analytics before we wrap it up?

2
00:00:06,918 --> 00:00:10,081
There was somebody who was asking if you've used

3
00:00:10,081 --> 00:00:11,838
load balancing for the Postgres?

4
00:00:11,838 --> 00:00:17,598
Yeah, so there isn't a load balancer in front of Postgres.

5
00:00:17,598 --> 00:00:19,859
If you use RDS,

6
00:00:19,859 --> 00:00:26,793
thy do have a master slave setup and there's a fair degree of

7
00:00:26,793 --> 00:00:30,017
resilience that's just built into that as a service.

8
00:00:30,017 --> 00:00:34,890
But there isn't a load balancer on top of Postgres mostly because like

9
00:00:34,890 --> 00:00:38,734
it's not exactly the same as like an HTTP request.

10
00:00:38,734 --> 00:00:44,455
We actually have a number of open TCP connections between our

11
00:00:44,455 --> 00:00:46,879
EC2 instances and our Postgres instance.

12
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,939
It can handle quite a few concurrent open connections,

13
00:00:50,939 --> 00:00:56,749
but it doesn't sort of handle traffic in that same way.

14
00:00:56,749 --> 00:01:12,583
So there isn't like a load balancer in front of Postgres per se.

15
00:01:12,583 --> 00:01:13,228
Cool!

16
00:01:13,228 --> 00:01:19,035
So, that's kind of all we're going to cover.

17
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:19,439
Obviously,

18
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,863
we haven't covered the entire universe of what's going to be

19
00:01:23,863 --> 00:01:26,533
necessary to get your application into production,

20
00:01:26,533 --> 00:01:32,685
but the hope is that the application that we've presented and worked on

21
00:01:32,685 --> 00:01:38,541
together over the last couple of days gives you the starting point for

22
00:01:38,541 --> 00:01:40,923
getting your application out the door.

23
00:01:40,923 --> 00:01:44,448
We've integrated in this application a lot of tools and

24
00:01:44,448 --> 00:01:47,844
technologies that you will bring to bear if you're going to

25
00:01:47,844 --> 00:01:49,998
actually operate this application in production,

26
00:01:49,998 --> 00:01:54,430
the build tooling, the technology stack,

27
00:01:54,430 --> 00:01:55,908
the monitoring,

28
00:01:55,908 --> 00:02:00,276
the ability to understand the performance implications of

29
00:02:00,276 --> 00:02:04,342
your application after it's been deployed,

30
00:02:04,342 --> 00:02:10,313
and infrastructure that with some tuning can be made to handle a whole

31
00:02:10,313 --> 00:02:13,812
bunch of load for a reasonably sized web application.

32
00:02:13,812 --> 00:02:14,248
So,

33
00:02:14,248 --> 00:02:18,756
what I hope you'll walk away from is a starting point

34
00:02:18,756 --> 00:02:21,021
to start building your own stack.

35
00:02:21,021 --> 00:02:24,106
But if you start from this one and just build on top of it,

36
00:02:24,106 --> 00:02:28,307
I think you'll ultimately be pretty happy.

37
00:02:28,307 --> 00:02:32,960
And if you have any questions as you go, my email address is kw@twilio.

38
00:02:32,960 --> 00:02:33,292
com.

39
00:02:33,292 --> 00:02:36,386
I'd be happy to answer any questions that you might

40
00:02:36,386 --> 00:02:39,492
have to the very best of my ability.

41
00:02:39,492 --> 00:02:41,826
I'm on the Twitters @kevinwhinnery,

42
00:02:41,826 --> 00:02:47,582
so you can follow me there as well where I mostly talk about nerd stuff.

43
00:02:47,582 --> 00:02:50,440
And I'm really grateful for having had the chance to spend this

44
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,234
time with you over the last couple of days.

45
00:02:52,234 --> 00:02:53,207
And I'll hang out today.

46
00:02:53,207 --> 00:02:56,459
I know a couple of you are still trying to get stuff running,

47
00:02:56,459 --> 00:03:01,139
so I'm happy to stay here until everybody is up and running

48
00:03:01,139 --> 00:03:03,915
with as much of the stack as they would like.

49
00:03:03,915 --> 00:03:11,000
So, thank you very much. I appreciate it.
