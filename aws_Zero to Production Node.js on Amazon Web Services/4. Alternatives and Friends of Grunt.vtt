00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.670
So the last bit before I turn you loose on some scripting tasks,

2
00:00:06.670 --> 00:00:10.397
which I'm kind of weird in that like command line

3
00:00:10.397 --> 00:00:12.306
scripting is like my favorite part of Node,

4
00:00:12.306 --> 00:00:15.077
like I love to do stuff on the command line.

5
00:00:15.077 --> 00:00:17.645
I don't know what my problem is.

6
00:00:17.645 --> 00:00:19.240
There's lots of alternatives out there.

7
00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.408
We already started talking about some of them.

8
00:00:22.408 --> 00:00:26.091
Gulp is probably the other major one.

9
00:00:26.091 --> 00:00:30.200
The big advantage of gulp over something like Grunt

10
00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.786
is the fact that it uses the Node.

11
00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:38.931
js stream's interface to stream data from one plugin to another so that

12
00:00:38.931 --> 00:00:44.072
you don't have to wait for one task to be completely finished before you

13
00:00:44.072 --> 00:00:47.882
can start streaming data to another task.

14
00:00:47.882 --> 00:00:51.750
And that is really cool, and it does speed things up oftentimes quite a lot,

15
00:00:51.750 --> 00:00:52.328
but again,

16
00:00:52.328 --> 00:00:56.089
old man Kevin kind of thinks it's harder to reason about how

17
00:00:56.089 --> 00:01:01.453
streams work and write custom tasks that execute in the order that

18
00:01:01.453 --> 00:01:04.479
I expect using the streaming interface.

19
00:01:04.479 --> 00:01:06.695
So I did gulp for a long time,

20
00:01:06.695 --> 00:01:10.010
and then I kind of found myself coming back to Grunt.

21
00:01:10.010 --> 00:01:11.842
Again, not because it's bad,

22
00:01:11.842 --> 00:01:15.361
just because my simple mind was able to comprehend what was

23
00:01:15.361 --> 00:01:18.001
going on in Grunt a little bit more easily.

24
00:01:18.001 --> 00:01:23.986
But it's superfast, and it also has a very nice ecosystem of tools.

25
00:01:23.986 --> 00:01:25.679
I think Grunt, Grunt has been around longer,

26
00:01:25.679 --> 00:01:28.734
so I think there's probably more out there for Grunt,

27
00:01:28.734 --> 00:01:32.207
but gulp probably is like cooler at this point,

28
00:01:32.207 --> 00:01:37.586
so there's maybe more new stuff being invented for gulp these days.

29
00:01:37.586 --> 00:01:41.815
Webpack is a tool that's out there that some folks have kind

30
00:01:41.815 --> 00:01:47.367
of used like as a front end for executing tasks like for

31
00:01:47.367 --> 00:01:48.869
compiling their front-end assets.

32
00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:52.693
And it's really awesome, like it does a lot of really cool stuff.

33
00:01:52.693 --> 00:01:55.013
It's got like really cool plugins.

34
00:01:55.013 --> 00:01:58.432
The way that you would implement like those cache-buster URLs

35
00:01:58.432 --> 00:02:00.690
that I was talking about briefly earlier,

36
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:05.025
I think the easiest way to do it is with webpack through Grunt.

37
00:02:05.025 --> 00:02:09.287
So there's a few --- there's lots of really great uses for it,

38
00:02:09.287 --> 00:02:12.651
but I think it's not necessarily as good of a general

39
00:02:12.651 --> 00:02:15.958
purpose task runner as Grunt is.

40
00:02:15.958 --> 00:02:16.507
Like I said,

41
00:02:16.507 --> 00:02:18.519
we use Grunt for all kinds of stuff from deploy tasks

42
00:02:18.519 --> 00:02:22.787
to like just simple scripting stuff, and that's not really what webpack is for.

43
00:02:22.787 --> 00:02:28.147
So using webpack from Grunt I think is the winning combo for me.

44
00:02:28.147 --> 00:02:30.584
Yeah, do we have another question?

45
00:02:30.584 --> 00:02:35.395
Yeah, what happens if you don't define a default task in the Gruntfile?

46
00:02:35.395 --> 00:02:39.009
If you don't define a default task and you just run Grunt,

47
00:02:39.009 --> 00:02:42.673
it will say that there's no default task defined,

48
00:02:42.673 --> 00:02:48.000
and it'll error out. That's what'll happen if you don't have a default defined.
