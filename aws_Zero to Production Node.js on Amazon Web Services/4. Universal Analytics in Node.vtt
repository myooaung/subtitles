00:00:03.841 --> 00:00:07.337
So what do you have to do to your code to put flags or whatever in

2
00:00:07.337 --> 00:00:09.502
there to make it easier to find them on the reports?

3
00:00:09.502 --> 00:00:09.850
Man,

4
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:13.680
are you on a two-wheeled machine that you lean to drive

5
00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.260
because that was an amazing segue, my friend,

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.159
into what we are going to do next,

7
00:00:19.159 --> 00:00:26.211
which is talk about how we implement universal analytics in Node.

8
00:00:26.211 --> 00:00:31.344
js where we will be adding JavaScript code to the client-side of our

9
00:00:31.344 --> 00:00:35.453
application to track page views and custom events.

10
00:00:35.453 --> 00:00:37.629
We talked a little bit about the custom event data model.

11
00:00:37.629 --> 00:00:42.460
A category is a logical grouping for a kind of event like video events.

12
00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:44.946
An action is a play, pause, or a scrub.

13
00:00:44.946 --> 00:00:48.695
And then a label might be the specific video that's being played.

14
00:00:48.695 --> 00:00:51.935
But the general stats around page views are what

15
00:00:51.935 --> 00:00:54.055
you're going to be collecting first.

16
00:00:54.055 --> 00:00:58.764
And a page view event will send with it all kinds of other

17
00:00:58.764 --> 00:01:05.000
events to Google to populate all the rest of the data that you saw on that interface.
