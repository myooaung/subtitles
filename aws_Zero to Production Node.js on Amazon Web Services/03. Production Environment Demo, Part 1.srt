1
00:00:03,952 --> 00:00:07,416
What I'm going to do is basically deploy our TodoMVC

2
00:00:07,416 --> 00:00:10,667
application to a production environment,

3
00:00:10,667 --> 00:00:15,541
and there's going to be some kind of bumps along the way

4
00:00:15,541 --> 00:00:19,389
because I'm going to actually manually configure a few things

5
00:00:19,389 --> 00:00:22,058
after the application has been deployed.

6
00:00:22,058 --> 00:00:25,355
But if you have an AWS account already,

7
00:00:25,355 --> 00:00:31,423
you can feel free to follow along because these will be the same

8
00:00:31,423 --> 00:00:38,937
steps that you'll need to reproduce after as we're trying to get

9
00:00:38,937 --> 00:00:41,763
the application deployed yourself.

10
00:00:41,763 --> 00:00:48,322
So, does everybody here --- does everybody have the,

11
00:00:48,322 --> 00:00:56,501
excuse me, an Amazon account, like at least an Amazon developer account?

12
00:00:56,501 --> 00:00:58,985
So we did go as far to sign up there.

13
00:00:58,985 --> 00:01:02,566
So that next thing that you'll want to do,

14
00:01:02,566 --> 00:01:07,443
and I'll drop this in the chat,

15
00:01:07,443 --> 00:01:11,304
is the Elastic Beanstalk Command Line Interface is

16
00:01:11,304 --> 00:01:12,914
something that you'll need to install.

17
00:01:12,914 --> 00:01:18,148
It's a Python utility; it can be installed on any platform.

18
00:01:18,148 --> 00:01:20,425
I'm looking at the docs right now, but let me drop it in the chat.

19
00:01:20,425 --> 00:01:36,782
(Working) And if you have Homebrew, it's actually fairly easy to get installed.

20
00:01:36,782 --> 00:01:41,421
There's actually a brew package that will do it right up for you.

21
00:01:41,421 --> 00:01:45,003
If you also have Python installed, you can install it with pip as well.

22
00:01:45,003 --> 00:01:49,245
So, let me go ahead and drop that in.

23
00:01:49,245 --> 00:01:57,740
So if you want to go through the process of starting to get that installed,

24
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:03,202
I will sort of slowly go into the Amazon console and give you a

25
00:02:03,202 --> 00:02:05,977
little chance to get that installed as we go.

26
00:02:05,977 --> 00:02:10,318
Because the first stop is going to be --- like once

27
00:02:10,318 --> 00:02:15,516
you sign in to your Amazon account, which I am right now,

28
00:02:15,516 --> 00:02:21,299
you'll probably see a dashboard that looks something like this.

29
00:02:21,299 --> 00:02:26,019
I'll deploy to a region that I haven't deployed to yet maybe,

30
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:31,471
or I guess could go US East.

31
00:02:31,471 --> 00:02:33,808
Doesn't really matter.

32
00:02:33,808 --> 00:02:38,870
Alright, so I'm going to be creating resources within the US East region,

33
00:02:38,870 --> 00:02:44,969
but first I need to start by creating an API user for myself.

34
00:02:44,969 --> 00:02:48,997
So from the dashboard, I'm going to go down to Identity & Access Management,

35
00:02:48,997 --> 00:02:55,925
and these users are actually shared across your account,

36
00:02:55,925 --> 00:03:01,179
so it doesn't matter which region your in for this particular one.

37
00:03:01,179 --> 00:03:05,666
So, the first thing that you're going to want to do is go down here to Users,

38
00:03:05,666 --> 00:03:14,302
and Create a New User, and you can give them a username of some kind.

39
00:03:14,302 --> 00:03:19,430
So like I'll go through and actually create one,

40
00:03:19,430 --> 00:03:22,835
although I actually have done this numerous times,

41
00:03:22,835 --> 00:03:24,870
so I already had one created.

42
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:27,341
So once you create a user,

43
00:03:27,341 --> 00:03:31,142
you'll have the opportunity here in the browser to

44
00:03:31,142 --> 00:03:32,977
see their security credentials,

45
00:03:32,977 --> 00:03:38,007
which is going to be their secret key and like a user ID.

46
00:03:38,007 --> 00:03:42,198
So you're going to want download those credentials and keep those in a

47
00:03:42,198 --> 00:03:44,783
safe location because it's not possible to retrieve them.

48
00:03:44,783 --> 00:03:45,773
If you lose them,

49
00:03:45,773 --> 00:03:49,204
you're going to have to regenerate credentials for

50
00:03:49,204 --> 00:03:52,861
the user for security reasons.

51
00:03:52,861 --> 00:03:55,584
So once you create a user, download your credentials.

52
00:03:55,584 --> 00:03:57,637
Store those in a safe location.

53
00:03:57,637 --> 00:04:03,296
It looks like Bohdan is saying that he always gets scared in the AWS console,

54
00:04:03,296 --> 00:04:06,418
and that is wise, as well you should.

55
00:04:06,418 --> 00:04:08,652
It's kind of a scary place.

56
00:04:08,652 --> 00:04:13,762
But hopefully we'll leave today with it being a little bit less scary.

57
00:04:13,762 --> 00:04:17,356
So once we have that user created,

58
00:04:17,356 --> 00:04:22,618
we're going to want to add that user to a group.

59
00:04:22,618 --> 00:04:26,372
And this is different from the security groups that

60
00:04:26,372 --> 00:04:27,883
we'll be talking about later,

61
00:04:27,883 --> 00:04:31,960
but it's essentially a user group which gives them certain

62
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:35,229
permissions within the AWS infrastructure.

63
00:04:35,229 --> 00:04:38,456
So in may case, I only have group defined,

64
00:04:38,456 --> 00:04:39,531
which is Admins,

65
00:04:39,531 --> 00:04:42,761
which kind of gives GodMode access to a user for all

66
00:04:42,761 --> 00:04:45,856
of the resources in my AWS account.

67
00:04:45,856 --> 00:04:47,517
As practical matter,

68
00:04:47,517 --> 00:04:51,387
most organizations you'll work in that use Amazon will have

69
00:04:51,387 --> 00:04:53,722
security groups with much more granular restrictions,

70
00:04:53,722 --> 00:05:02,135
but if we look at that briefly just to give you an idea of what it is,

71
00:05:02,135 --> 00:05:11,221
let's see, so we can see the users that are in a group,

72
00:05:11,221 --> 00:05:13,149
and its permissions.

73
00:05:13,149 --> 00:05:17,647
And Amazon has essentially like a language,

74
00:05:17,647 --> 00:05:21,240
a DSL for determining like what resources a given

75
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,363
group or a given user has access to, and the administrator access policy,

76
00:05:28,363 --> 00:05:30,462
it's JSON based obviously,

77
00:05:30,462 --> 00:05:35,006
and for the administrators basically says that you can allow like

78
00:05:35,006 --> 00:05:37,518
all kinds of actions on every kind of resource.

79
00:05:37,518 --> 00:05:39,677
So it's the most permissive one,

80
00:05:39,677 --> 00:05:44,156
but you can make these very tightly scoped to specific products,

81
00:05:44,156 --> 00:05:48,583
to specific instances of services as granular as you feel

82
00:05:48,583 --> 00:05:51,188
like you need those services to be.

83
00:05:51,188 --> 00:05:58,033
So, once you have created, excuse me, a user,

84
00:05:58,033 --> 00:06:05,295
added them to a group which has sufficient permission to --- yes,

85
00:06:05,295 --> 00:06:05,789
question?

86
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:07,315
Some people are asking you like how you're going through this.

87
00:06:07,315 --> 00:06:08,866
Do you just want them to watch for now and then they're

88
00:06:08,866 --> 00:06:10,640
going to go through it themselves?

89
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:13,792
Some people are behind, but â€¦ Yeah,

90
00:06:13,792 --> 00:06:17,984
I mean I think that if you want to follow along,

91
00:06:17,984 --> 00:06:19,508
that is totally fine.

92
00:06:19,508 --> 00:06:22,703
The first page of the documentation that I put in the chat

93
00:06:22,703 --> 00:06:25,114
will also take you through the same process.

94
00:06:25,114 --> 00:06:27,903
So, if you want to --- for me personally,

95
00:06:27,903 --> 00:06:30,470
I like to see it and then do it,

96
00:06:30,470 --> 00:06:34,683
but if you --- I would recommend that you probably watch at

97
00:06:34,683 --> 00:06:38,018
this time and then try to recreate it.

98
00:06:38,018 --> 00:06:39,535
Because if we all try to do it together,

99
00:06:39,535 --> 00:06:42,219
like it's not going to --- like I don't think it'll work.

100
00:06:42,219 --> 00:06:45,011
So we'll go through the process, I'll show you the steps,

101
00:06:45,011 --> 00:06:48,499
and then I'll help each of you get through it with the rest

102
00:06:48,499 --> 00:06:51,831
of the time we have here this afternoon.

103
00:06:51,831 --> 00:06:54,802
Alright, so we create a user, we download our credentials,

104
00:06:54,802 --> 00:07:02,000
we add that user to a group or give that user permissions to access the resources that it's going to need.
