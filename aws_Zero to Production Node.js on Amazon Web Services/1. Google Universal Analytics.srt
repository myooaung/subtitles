00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,578
What we're going to finish up with is a topic which

2
00:00:13,578 --> 00:00:15,879
is near and dear to my heart,

3
00:00:15,879 --> 00:00:22,769
which might be kind of strange considering I'm a developer by trade,

4
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:27,987
but understanding what's going on in your application from a user's

5
00:00:27,987 --> 00:00:33,517
perspective is something I try to get better at every day and make part of

6
00:00:33,517 --> 00:00:36,700
my decision-making process as much as I possibly can.

7
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:41,822
And the primary tool that we use to do that is Google Analytics.

8
00:00:41,822 --> 00:00:49,081
There are actually some other paid tools that you can use that are very cool.

9
00:00:49,081 --> 00:00:54,083
My new favorite toy is Heap analytics where you can retroactively create

10
00:00:54,083 --> 00:01:01,175
behavior statistics by essentially creating CSS selectors for elements on

11
00:01:01,175 --> 00:01:03,836
your page and attaching events to those.

12
00:01:03,836 --> 00:01:05,698
And you don't need to instrument those events ahead of time,

13
00:01:05,698 --> 00:01:10,246
you can actually retroactively pull those events out.

14
00:01:10,246 --> 00:01:11,852
So there's that.

15
00:01:11,852 --> 00:01:16,134
There's Optimizely, which is useful for AB testing.

16
00:01:16,134 --> 00:01:19,195
But the core of it all is definitely the data that

17
00:01:19,195 --> 00:01:20,864
we get out of Google Analytics.

18
00:01:20,864 --> 00:01:25,150
So what we'll do in this section is we'll learn a little bit about what

19
00:01:25,150 --> 00:01:29,346
kind of intelligence we can glean from Google Analytics,

20
00:01:29,346 --> 00:01:33,445
I'll hop into the UI and point out a couple of the key

21
00:01:33,445 --> 00:01:38,316
features that you might want to check out in your quest

22
00:01:38,316 --> 00:01:41,143
to find data about your users,

23
00:01:41,143 --> 00:01:47,182
and then we'll also take our last code break of the day to

24
00:01:47,182 --> 00:01:51,993
actually implement universal analytics on our TodoMVC

25
00:01:51,993 --> 00:01:55,482
application using a handy node module.

26
00:01:55,482 --> 00:02:00,306
So, why do you care about analytics in the first place?

27
00:02:00,306 --> 00:02:03,943
Mostly because you don't know everything.

28
00:02:03,943 --> 00:02:08,623
You have a strong hypothesis about what a user might need,

29
00:02:08,623 --> 00:02:11,495
about places they might go on your site,

30
00:02:11,495 --> 00:02:14,815
but all it is without data is your opinion.

31
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:15,203
So,

32
00:02:15,203 --> 00:02:18,710
using Google Analytics as a part of your decision-making

33
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,566
process as a developer for what you spend your time on ends

34
00:02:23,566 --> 00:02:26,898
up being a useful skill to acquire.

35
00:02:26,898 --> 00:02:32,157
Once you realize that you want to be working as smartly as you can

36
00:02:32,157 --> 00:02:34,640
and not just shipping code with your head down,

37
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,330
Google Analytics can help you make the best decisions possible

38
00:02:37,330 --> 00:02:41,014
for what you're going to be focusing on.

39
00:02:41,014 --> 00:02:44,852
And when you look at some of the data coming from your application,

40
00:02:44,852 --> 00:02:47,208
you'll be able to serve your users better.

41
00:02:47,208 --> 00:02:49,121
You'll understand what they find useful,

42
00:02:49,121 --> 00:02:50,396
what they're searching for,

43
00:02:50,396 --> 00:02:54,310
and you can help them find it a little bit more easily.

44
00:02:54,310 --> 00:02:59,004
So are parts of Google Analytics free or is it all free or is it

45
00:02:59,004 --> 00:03:01,660
a --- You can sign up for Google Analytics.

46
00:03:01,660 --> 00:03:05,119
Yeah, it's free so you can integrate it on your site.

47
00:03:05,119 --> 00:03:11,866
There is a premium offering for Google Analytics, but it is --- what is it like?

48
00:03:11,866 --> 00:03:15,018
Like, it's in the six figures annually.

49
00:03:15,018 --> 00:03:20,608
I forget what the actual price tag is, but it is quite expensive.

50
00:03:20,608 --> 00:03:26,855
And you can get closer to real-time data and some more granular information.

51
00:03:26,855 --> 00:03:29,440
But the core of the offering is definitely free.

52
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:36,318
Now, who in here is in Google Analytics regularly?

53
00:03:36,318 --> 00:03:40,001
So we've got James, we got Mark, a couple folks looking around.

54
00:03:40,001 --> 00:03:40,890
That's okay.

55
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:51,000
As developers, it's not something that we necessarily do every day, but it can make all of us better at our jobs if we're developing for the web.
