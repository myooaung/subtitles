1
00:00:04,173 --> 00:00:06,522
You all have risen to the challenge very effectively here.

2
00:00:06,522 --> 00:00:07,384
Good job team.

3
00:00:07,384 --> 00:00:09,108
I knew you could do it.

4
00:00:09,108 --> 00:00:12,237
I had nothing but the utmost confidence.

5
00:00:12,237 --> 00:00:17,602
I perused the pull request that came in for these specific issues,

6
00:00:17,602 --> 00:00:21,844
and we have great solutions for all three issues.

7
00:00:21,844 --> 00:00:25,859
So we have two that are clearly winners,

8
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,740
like they're what I was looking for,

9
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,278
and then we have one that is correct and one that is more correct,

10
00:00:33,278 --> 00:00:37,837
so we'll look at both the correct one and the more correct one.

11
00:00:37,837 --> 00:00:46,116
So #1 we got from juan267 who I imagine is hanging out on the live stream.

12
00:00:46,116 --> 00:00:48,170
So what's up buddy?

13
00:00:48,170 --> 00:00:49,197
Good job.

14
00:00:49,197 --> 00:00:55,159
This is the most minimal edition of the morgan logger that we could've added.

15
00:00:55,159 --> 00:00:59,538
So what he did was he npm installed that module

16
00:00:59,538 --> 00:01:05,306
using probably the --save command, or he might've added manually.

17
00:01:05,306 --> 00:01:07,721
That also is a possibility.

18
00:01:07,721 --> 00:01:10,237
But when you know that you want to add another module

19
00:01:10,237 --> 00:01:14,827
to your project's dependencies, you can execute this command,

20
00:01:14,827 --> 00:01:24,161
npm install, and then --save will actually write the dependency to your package.

21
00:01:24,161 --> 00:01:28,406
json so that the next time another developer npm installs your

22
00:01:28,406 --> 00:01:30,959
project they will get that dependency as well.

23
00:01:30,959 --> 00:01:31,331
So,

24
00:01:31,331 --> 00:01:37,167
it's always a best practice when you add a dependency to add it to the package.

25
00:01:37,167 --> 00:01:38,112
json as well,

26
00:01:38,112 --> 00:01:42,517
and npm install --save is usually the best way to do that and

27
00:01:42,517 --> 00:01:45,532
lock in the current version of the module.

28
00:01:45,532 --> 00:01:49,350
So probably what we had here was an npm install --save morgan,

29
00:01:49,350 --> 00:01:52,565
which would add that dependency to our package.

30
00:01:52,565 --> 00:01:54,574
json as we have here.

31
00:01:54,574 --> 00:01:58,382
And then we require the morgan module,

32
00:01:58,382 --> 00:02:06,576
and by the default behavior of morgan is to log HTTP requests to standard out,

33
00:02:06,576 --> 00:02:11,701
and he's mounted that middleware there in front of

34
00:02:11,701 --> 00:02:14,635
just about everything else here.

35
00:02:14,635 --> 00:02:20,554
So, we will get that HTTP logging output on every request to the server.

36
00:02:20,554 --> 00:02:28,298
So, I'm going to go ahead and +1 that, so +1 for me,

37
00:02:28,298 --> 00:02:33,325
and I'm going to merge that down, so good work.

38
00:02:33,325 --> 00:02:38,007
And we'll pull that down here in just a little bit.

39
00:02:38,007 --> 00:02:38,392
Alright,

40
00:02:38,392 --> 00:02:43,018
so the other one we did was to take a look at

41
00:02:43,018 --> 00:02:45,219
removing that X-Powered-By --- actually,

42
00:02:45,219 --> 00:02:49,551
we'll do that last because that has the two answers.

43
00:02:49,551 --> 00:02:55,473
The other one was adding and X-Shenanigans-None header to the response.

44
00:02:55,473 --> 00:03:01,356
So we have a couple of submissions there,

45
00:03:01,356 --> 00:03:06,074
so we'll go to this one from James that fixes #7,

46
00:03:06,074 --> 00:03:11,181
and this is probably the lightest weight way of doing it.

47
00:03:11,181 --> 00:03:12,635
In the webapp.

48
00:03:12,635 --> 00:03:19,615
js he added a new middleware, just declared it in line, which is probably fine.

49
00:03:19,615 --> 00:03:23,366
You could've created another file, probably would've been overkill here.

50
00:03:23,366 --> 00:03:27,837
He sets the X-Shenanigans header on the response using response.

51
00:03:27,837 --> 00:03:35,195
set, which is a method available on an Express decorated HTTP response object,

52
00:03:35,195 --> 00:03:39,971
and then he calls next to move onto the next piece of middleware.

53
00:03:39,971 --> 00:03:44,394
And that's all we need to do to add that header to the todos routes.

54
00:03:44,394 --> 00:03:55,280
So I'm going to +1 that, great work, and I'm going to merge it down.

55
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:56,085
Awesome!

56
00:03:56,085 --> 00:04:03,325
So now for the removing the Powered-By Express issue,

57
00:04:03,325 --> 00:04:07,327
we had a couple approaches, both of which are --- both of which work,

58
00:04:07,327 --> 00:04:12,411
one of which is slightly more correct, so let's see if I can find the one.

59
00:04:12,411 --> 00:04:13,035
Okay.

60
00:04:13,035 --> 00:04:23,047
So this is the version which is correct but not as correct as it could be.

61
00:04:23,047 --> 00:04:27,485
So here we've defined a global middleware,

62
00:04:27,485 --> 00:04:30,726
which is going to be executed on every request that will remove that

63
00:04:30,726 --> 00:04:35,500
header X-Powered-By from every response that we send back.

64
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:37,076
And that will have the desired effect,

65
00:04:37,076 --> 00:04:39,519
but it will also execute on every single request.

66
00:04:39,519 --> 00:04:41,704
So, it's a little bit insufficient.

67
00:04:41,704 --> 00:04:44,446
We don't necessarily need to take that header off on

68
00:04:44,446 --> 00:04:46,843
every single request to the server.

69
00:04:46,843 --> 00:04:54,288
So probably what we want to do is actually disable that option in Express.

70
00:04:54,288 --> 00:05:02,421
So I think we have a pull request here which does just that,

71
00:05:02,421 --> 00:05:06,445
so within the configuration options for Express.

72
00:05:06,445 --> 00:05:08,536
So Express has this app.

73
00:05:08,536 --> 00:05:13,605
--- on an Express app has a set and a get function,

74
00:05:13,605 --> 00:05:16,879
and those will set configuration properties and

75
00:05:16,879 --> 00:05:18,750
also get configuration properties.

76
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:21,136
In this case, he is setting a configuration property,

77
00:05:21,136 --> 00:05:26,025
this x-powered-by header to false so Express will never send it at all.

78
00:05:26,025 --> 00:05:26,936
Yes, question.

79
00:05:26,936 --> 00:05:31,516
Is there any meaningful difference between doing this method of.

80
00:05:31,516 --> 00:05:36,836
set for the header to false and doing.

81
00:05:36,836 --> 00:05:40,309
disable of the entire header?

82
00:05:40,309 --> 00:05:40,864
App.

83
00:05:40,864 --> 00:05:42,530
disable x-powered-by specifically.

84
00:05:42,530 --> 00:05:44,259
This one's not a header.

85
00:05:44,259 --> 00:05:45,642
It's a config value.

86
00:05:45,642 --> 00:05:46,033
Okay.

87
00:05:46,033 --> 00:05:51,529
So this one's on app whereas the other one was on response.

88
00:05:51,529 --> 00:05:56,904
Right, but you can also do, at least according to the Interwebs, you can do app.

89
00:05:56,904 --> 00:06:01,164
disable x-powered-by in the same area in webapp.

90
00:06:01,164 --> 00:06:03,359
js in the rest of the middleware.

91
00:06:03,359 --> 00:06:03,703
Yeah,

92
00:06:03,703 --> 00:06:07,827
I believe there's also a signature there for disable for Boolean properties.

93
00:06:07,827 --> 00:06:13,284
So like this is expressly just setting a property to false.

94
00:06:13,284 --> 00:06:17,901
Disable, I believe, toggles a Boolean property like x-powered-by to false,

95
00:06:17,901 --> 00:06:21,261
so they're equivalent in this case.

96
00:06:21,261 --> 00:06:24,541
So the correctest might've been app.

97
00:06:24,541 --> 00:06:25,634
disable x-powered-by,

98
00:06:25,634 --> 00:06:30,708
and it would've saved us a couple characters there if we wanted to go that way.

99
00:06:30,708 --> 00:06:33,493
So, go back out here.

100
00:06:33,493 --> 00:06:35,721
I've got some +1s.

101
00:06:35,721 --> 00:06:37,949
James added some docs.

102
00:06:37,949 --> 00:06:39,355
Look at you.

103
00:06:39,355 --> 00:06:40,292
Good work.

104
00:06:40,292 --> 00:06:48,006
I'm going to add my own +1, and we're going to merge it down.

105
00:06:48,006 --> 00:06:49,519
Super job!

106
00:06:49,519 --> 00:06:59,423
So now, if we go back out here, we've got some add logging middleware.

107
00:06:59,423 --> 00:07:03,955
I thought we would've closed this out, and so.

108
00:07:03,955 --> 00:07:08,733
I think we just didn't mention it in the commit message, which is fine.

109
00:07:08,733 --> 00:07:12,037
I'm going to go ahead and close this out.

110
00:07:12,037 --> 00:07:12,430
So,

111
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:18,070
30 minutes later we just knocked out two or three GitHub issues on our project,

112
00:07:18,070 --> 00:07:18,870
so great work.

113
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,138
We're going to do that again a couple more times here today,

114
00:07:22,138 --> 00:07:25,898
and then I've got a fresh batch that I'm going to load in there

115
00:07:25,898 --> 00:07:28,204
tomorrow for you guys to go crazy on as well.

116
00:07:28,204 --> 00:07:34,000
So, knocked this first one out of the park. Very nicely done.
