00:00:03.968 --> 00:00:07.817
The other bit that I'll show you in the administrative section is how to

2
00:00:07.817 --> 00:00:12.620
create a goal because a lot of the very useful stuff you can do in Google

3
00:00:12.620 --> 00:00:17.097
Analytics results is about like users reaching a goal.

4
00:00:17.097 --> 00:00:22.778
So if I go into the Goals section and create a new goal,

5
00:00:22.778 --> 00:00:28.301
a very common goal, there are lots of different kinds,

6
00:00:28.301 --> 00:00:35.539
but a goal that you're probably going to use a lot is --- what is this?

7
00:00:35.539 --> 00:00:37.232
This is new.

8
00:00:37.232 --> 00:00:42.876
I'm going to go with Custom because this scares me.

9
00:00:42.876 --> 00:00:47.460
So, a goal we're probably going to use a lot is arriving on a certain page.

10
00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:50.812
Whether it's like a marketing page that you're trying to drive a lot of

11
00:00:50.812 --> 00:00:54.241
traffic to or if it's a page like after a user signs up,

12
00:00:54.241 --> 00:00:59.555
it's a successful signup page, if people are reaching those goal pages,

13
00:00:59.555 --> 00:01:03.914
like that is an event that you want to track in your analytics.

14
00:01:03.914 --> 00:01:10.151
So, I could create a goal for a page that doesn't exist called signup.

15
00:01:10.151 --> 00:01:14.191
And you can only, in Google Analytics, this is another limitation,

16
00:01:14.191 --> 00:01:16.558
you can only set a certain amount of goals.

17
00:01:16.558 --> 00:01:21.716
I haven't used any of my goal slots yet, so I will go with Goal 1.

18
00:01:21.716 --> 00:01:25.306
And, the type of goal I'm going to create is a destination.

19
00:01:25.306 --> 00:01:32.132
So that's going to be a specific place that somebody can go on my site.

20
00:01:32.132 --> 00:01:33.749
And then, for the destination,

21
00:01:33.749 --> 00:01:39.013
you can have any page that begins with something or you can

22
00:01:39.013 --> 00:01:43.029
have a specific page like /signup-success.

23
00:01:43.029 --> 00:01:43.294
So,

24
00:01:43.294 --> 00:01:45.680
this is how you know that somebody successfully made

25
00:01:45.680 --> 00:01:47.967
it through your entire signup flow.

26
00:01:47.967 --> 00:01:51.886
And then there's other advanced stuff you can do

27
00:01:51.886 --> 00:01:54.837
here for funnels and what have you.

28
00:01:54.837 --> 00:01:59.519
But I'm going to create that goal even though I'm not going

29
00:01:59.519 --> 00:02:02.531
to actually catch anybody with that goal.

30
00:02:02.531 --> 00:02:08.822
But if I go back to my customization and my custom report,

31
00:02:08.822 --> 00:02:15.941
I can actually track that now as a metric in my report.

32
00:02:15.941 --> 00:02:20.807
So in this case, I won't name my report yet,

33
00:02:20.807 --> 00:02:27.784
but I will add as a metric here that specific goal that I just configured.

34
00:02:27.784 --> 00:02:32.811
So, it was Goal 1, which we called signup.

35
00:02:32.811 --> 00:02:38.019
So, there are a few different metrics you can track based on the goal.

36
00:02:38.019 --> 00:02:43.634
You can check the raw number, which is going to be signup completions.

37
00:02:43.634 --> 00:02:48.026
So that'll be the raw number of times somebody arrived on that page.

38
00:02:48.026 --> 00:02:53.004
And then you can also track the --- Goal 1,

39
00:02:53.004 --> 00:02:56.489
you can also track the conversion rate.

40
00:02:56.489 --> 00:02:56.775
So,

41
00:02:56.775 --> 00:02:59.922
this is one that you're going to use in conjunction with

42
00:02:59.922 --> 00:03:01.884
a landing page report like this one.

43
00:03:01.884 --> 00:03:05.475
So you can say across all landing pages on my site,

44
00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:10.927
show me how many signups each one of them generated,

45
00:03:10.927 --> 00:03:13.037
and then also show me the conversion rate,

46
00:03:13.037 --> 00:03:16.698
what percentage of sessions that began on this page

47
00:03:16.698 --> 00:03:21.390
resulted in the type of goal that I created.

48
00:03:21.390 --> 00:03:25.692
So this ends up being a powerful combination to start looking at

49
00:03:25.692 --> 00:03:29.597
specific sections of content in your site to understand like

50
00:03:29.597 --> 00:03:31.772
what pages are performing the best,

51
00:03:31.772 --> 00:03:34.752
what sections of the site are performing the best,

52
00:03:34.752 --> 00:03:38.717
and how good a job you're doing at converting users into doing

53
00:03:38.717 --> 00:03:43.069
the things that you care about on your site.

54
00:03:43.069 --> 00:03:50.409
Now the last bit I'll show you here in the UI is the ability to create segments.

55
00:03:50.409 --> 00:03:54.115
And a wise man once told me that segments are where

56
00:03:54.115 --> 00:03:55.800
Jesus lives in Google Analytics.

57
00:03:55.800 --> 00:04:01.188
And this is how you can really start to break down which sets of

58
00:04:01.188 --> 00:04:04.787
browsing sessions on your site are the most valuable.

59
00:04:04.787 --> 00:04:10.907
So if I open up this UI to create a new segment,

60
00:04:10.907 --> 00:04:16.294
I can create a customized view of a certain set of users and

61
00:04:16.294 --> 00:04:22.250
compare them to other kinds of users on my site.

62
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:30.556
So for this one, I will say Russian Users because apparently my site,

63
00:04:30.556 --> 00:04:35.026
like there's some weird spammy stuff going on so like over half

64
00:04:35.026 --> 00:04:38.023
of the traffic to my site is from Russia.

65
00:04:38.023 --> 00:04:38.510
So,

66
00:04:38.510 --> 00:04:43.378
we'll separate them out as a segment and look at

67
00:04:43.378 --> 00:04:45.731
them in comparison to some others.

68
00:04:45.731 --> 00:04:52.622
So, some of the conditions we can do are demographics and location.

69
00:04:52.622 --> 00:05:01.463
So we can do country contains Russia.

70
00:05:01.463 --> 00:05:03.848
And that's going to be, as it updates, oh,

71
00:05:03.848 --> 00:05:08.833
it's only 48%, I guess, of users on my site are coming from Russia.

72
00:05:08.833 --> 00:05:16.970
So I've created a segment for just Russian users that visit my website.

73
00:05:16.970 --> 00:05:23.747
So I can look at just those users and then I can look at the inverse as well.

74
00:05:23.747 --> 00:05:30.292
So I can create a segment for non-Russians.

75
00:05:30.292 --> 00:05:46.300
And I can look at how the behavior of these two --- does not contain.

76
00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:52.609
And if our math is correct, --- (Inaudible) Oh I didn't --- oh oops,

77
00:05:52.609 --> 00:05:53.679
did I say contains?

78
00:05:53.679 --> 00:05:55.860
I think it changed it back when you chose the country.

79
00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.554
Oh oops.

80
00:05:57.554 --> 00:06:00.094
Does not contain.

81
00:06:00.094 --> 00:06:02.635
Good job team.

82
00:06:02.635 --> 00:06:07.245
And there we are back to 51%.

83
00:06:07.245 --> 00:06:07.904
And,

84
00:06:07.904 --> 00:06:14.504
let's edit this report back to something that might actually be like kind of

85
00:06:14.504 --> 00:06:21.104
interesting and look at some metrics like time on page,

86
00:06:21.104 --> 00:06:28.383
like average time on page and bounce rate,

87
00:06:28.383 --> 00:06:30.630
let's say.

88
00:06:30.630 --> 00:06:35.124
We'll save that up.

89
00:06:35.124 --> 00:06:42.698
So, it turns out that the Russian traffic,

90
00:06:42.698 --> 00:06:46.965
which I assumed to be almost completely due to shenanigans,

91
00:06:46.965 --> 00:06:52.679
is a much higher time on page and people from everywhere

92
00:06:52.679 --> 00:06:57.922
else in the world spend an average of 30 seconds on any

93
00:06:57.922 --> 00:06:59.767
given landing page on the site.

94
00:06:59.767 --> 00:07:02.865
So I can kind of sort and see which ones are performing

95
00:07:02.865 --> 00:07:06.292
the best based on average time on page.

96
00:07:06.292 --> 00:07:09.000
The about page is clearly out performing,

97
00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.616
but I can see that folks that are coming from outside of Russia

98
00:07:13.616 --> 00:07:17.007
actually bounce much less frequently so they're more likely to see

99
00:07:17.007 --> 00:07:21.017
more than one page during their browsing session.

100
00:07:21.017 --> 00:07:27.751
So, doing segments by geography can be useful.

101
00:07:27.751 --> 00:07:30.263
But it's also very useful to create segments by event.

102
00:07:30.263 --> 00:07:35.547
So, if you have a session which contained like a video play event,

103
00:07:35.547 --> 00:07:39.084
those types of users might behave very differently from users that

104
00:07:39.084 --> 00:07:43.555
didn't initiate like a video play say on your site.

105
00:07:43.555 --> 00:07:46.525
So, I know there's a ton to do in this tool.

106
00:07:46.525 --> 00:07:51.738
If you have more questions about it, I'm happy to geek out on this.

107
00:07:51.738 --> 00:07:55.858
I'm learning more about the tool all the time trying to get better at it.

108
00:07:55.858 --> 00:07:57.138
And the more I learn,

109
00:07:57.138 --> 00:08:01.140
the more I want to learn more about how users are interacting with the site.

110
00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:01.428
So,

111
00:08:01.428 --> 00:08:08.000
hopefully this will put a bug in your ear to get that same level of visibility into your own websites.
