1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:47.153
(Introduction) Oh yeah, very, very stoked to be here.

2
00:00:47.153 --> 00:00:48.928
Hi, as Mark said, my name is Kevin Whinnery.

3
00:00:48.928 --> 00:00:50.536
I work for an outfit called Twilio.

4
00:00:50.536 --> 00:00:54.129
We make an API that lets you send and receive text messages,

5
00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.324
make and receive phone calls,

6
00:00:56.324 --> 00:00:59.202
and embed chat and video calling and any kind of communication

7
00:00:59.202 --> 00:01:03.102
experience that you might imagine into your applications.

8
00:01:03.102 --> 00:01:06.135
And I lead a team called developer education,

9
00:01:06.135 --> 00:01:09.215
and we build the website which serves twilio.

10
00:01:09.215 --> 00:01:13.647
com/docs and also manage a couple other internal services as well.

11
00:01:13.647 --> 00:01:17.461
And yeah, I'm very, very stoked to be here.

12
00:01:17.461 --> 00:01:22.709
One of my favorite parts about the job is when I can get in front of groups of

13
00:01:22.709 --> 00:01:27.951
folks and work through some content and facilitate some learning on your part

14
00:01:27.951 --> 00:01:31.738
on a subject that I like to talk about a lot,

15
00:01:31.738 --> 00:01:32.994
which is Node.

16
00:01:32.994 --> 00:01:33.413
js.

17
00:01:33.413 --> 00:01:39.279
Just a quick refresher on the agenda, we are going to be here for two days,

18
00:01:39.279 --> 00:01:41.797
so make sure that you take care of yourself,

19
00:01:41.797 --> 00:01:45.105
take breaks whenever you need to because it definitely going

20
00:01:45.105 --> 00:01:49.004
to be a lot of content and a lot of code for over the course

21
00:01:49.004 --> 00:01:50.579
of the next couple of days.

22
00:01:50.579 --> 00:01:51.144
And today,

23
00:01:51.144 --> 00:01:55.416
we're going to start off by getting to know some folks here in the

24
00:01:55.416 --> 00:01:58.098
room and also hopefully online a little bit.

25
00:01:58.098 --> 00:02:01.679
Looks like we have a good set of folks, 52 users right now online,

26
00:02:01.679 --> 00:02:02.880
which is pretty awesome.

27
00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:09.613
And then over the course of the next couple days we'll be talking about a Node.

28
00:02:09.613 --> 00:02:11.916
js application code base.

29
00:02:11.916 --> 00:02:14.195
And I'll get into some of the theory around that

30
00:02:14.195 --> 00:02:15.993
after we talk about the agenda here,

31
00:02:15.993 --> 00:02:19.658
but we'll kind of start with the basics of just running a Node.

32
00:02:19.658 --> 00:02:20.368
js web server,

33
00:02:20.368 --> 00:02:23.867
talk a little bit about some of the build tools and the automation

34
00:02:23.867 --> 00:02:27.564
that's built into the project that we'll be looking at.

35
00:02:27.564 --> 00:02:31.935
We'll take a break after, and we'll be writing code,

36
00:02:31.935 --> 00:02:35.855
a lot of code, in between each of these presentations.

37
00:02:35.855 --> 00:02:38.074
Then we'll talk about the data tier of the application

38
00:02:38.074 --> 00:02:40.251
and some of the choices we made there,

39
00:02:40.251 --> 00:02:45.908
and then we'll cap off the day by actually deploying this application to AWS.

40
00:02:45.908 --> 00:02:48.660
So, if you haven't already,

41
00:02:48.660 --> 00:02:51.946
now would be an excellent time or at some point in the near

42
00:02:51.946 --> 00:02:54.193
future to sign up for an AWS account.

43
00:02:54.193 --> 00:02:58.462
Everything that we'll do today can be done with the free tier of services.

44
00:02:58.462 --> 00:03:00.908
So you can sign up for an account,

45
00:03:00.908 --> 00:03:05.475
and then we'll actually kind of together go through the steps that you need to

46
00:03:05.475 --> 00:03:10.056
accomplish to get this application configured and deployed.

47
00:03:10.056 --> 00:03:13.496
And we'll be doing a little more manually than you might

48
00:03:13.496 --> 00:03:16.251
after you've done this a few times,

49
00:03:16.251 --> 00:03:19.814
but configuring the stack manually has some advantages in

50
00:03:19.814 --> 00:03:22.724
learning kind of what some of the moving parts are.

51
00:03:22.724 --> 00:03:23.135
So,

52
00:03:23.135 --> 00:03:27.617
we'll be kind of configuring our production environment and kind of

53
00:03:27.617 --> 00:03:30.566
understanding what all those different moving pieces are.

54
00:03:30.566 --> 00:03:32.810
Then tomorrow we'll be talking about the front end,

55
00:03:32.810 --> 00:03:36.650
so we'll talk about some of the front-end toolchain bits

56
00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:41.278
that we're using to build and compile our JavaScript and

57
00:03:41.278 --> 00:03:44.182
CSS assets for the front end.

58
00:03:44.182 --> 00:03:48.959
And then we'll talk about how we actually build the front end with Vue.

59
00:03:48.959 --> 00:03:49.300
js.

60
00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:51.552
Our sample application uses Vue.

61
00:03:51.552 --> 00:03:58.588
It's a --- it's not quite the behemoth of say React or Angular or one of those,

62
00:03:58.588 --> 00:04:01.867
but the toolchain and the general techniques of building an

63
00:04:01.867 --> 00:04:04.558
application like this will be similar across all those.

64
00:04:04.558 --> 00:04:06.906
And if you haven't checked out Vue before,

65
00:04:06.906 --> 00:04:12.211
hopefully it'll kind of whet your appetite for what I think is kind of a nice

66
00:04:12.211 --> 00:04:16.282
middle ground between very large frameworks like React,

67
00:04:16.282 --> 00:04:20.335
which kind of assert themselves into your application in a big way,

68
00:04:20.335 --> 00:04:21.945
and something maybe lightweight like jQuery,

69
00:04:21.945 --> 00:04:25.424
I think it kind of sits in an interesting middle

70
00:04:25.424 --> 00:04:27.760
ground between those two frameworks.

71
00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:31.887
We'll talk a little bit about how we create a real-time component to this

72
00:04:31.887 --> 00:04:36.065
application and some of the things that we have to work through in our

73
00:04:36.065 --> 00:04:40.394
production environment on AWS to make sure that works correctly.

74
00:04:40.394 --> 00:04:41.756
We'll take a little break,

75
00:04:41.756 --> 00:04:46.600
and then we'll finish up the afternoon by looking at some of the lesser

76
00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:50.178
known --- the lesser celebrated parts of web development,

77
00:04:50.178 --> 00:04:53.538
which are the things that you have to do after the application is

78
00:04:53.538 --> 00:04:57.475
deployed to make sure that it stays running in production,

79
00:04:57.475 --> 00:05:00.790
that it can handle a reasonable amount of load,

80
00:05:00.790 --> 00:05:04.373
that it is actually solving problems for your users and how

81
00:05:04.373 --> 00:05:07.630
to kind of instrument your application to understand how

82
00:05:07.630 --> 00:05:09.818
users are interacting with it.

83
00:05:09.818 --> 00:05:12.788
So we'll talk a little bit about those production monitoring and load testing

84
00:05:12.788 --> 00:05:18.299
tools and also dig into some web analytic stuff as well.

85
00:05:18.299 --> 00:05:20.792
And then afterwards I will definitely stick around for as

86
00:05:20.792 --> 00:05:24.276
long as folks want to for Q&A on both days.

87
00:05:24.276 --> 00:05:28.546
And we should have enough time in between each of the

88
00:05:28.546 --> 00:05:32.068
presentations and the brief demos to answer any questions

89
00:05:32.068 --> 00:05:33.305
that folks might have as well,

90
00:05:33.305 --> 00:05:39.106
and I'm happy to dive as deep as I can into those different areas.

91
00:05:39.106 --> 00:05:45.678
So, the title of this course is Zero to Production with Node.

92
00:05:45.678 --> 00:05:46.121
js,

93
00:05:46.121 --> 00:05:49.991
and the reason I wanted to approach the workshop like

94
00:05:49.991 --> 00:05:51.534
this in a slightly different way,

95
00:05:51.534 --> 00:05:56.015
Mark said I actually did do a workshop many years ago which focused

96
00:05:56.015 --> 00:05:59.364
on just a sort of basic introduction to Node.

97
00:05:59.364 --> 00:06:03.326
js and some of the key modules that you're likely to

98
00:06:03.326 --> 00:06:05.609
use in your journey as a Node.

99
00:06:05.609 --> 00:06:09.376
js developer, but that is really like kind of the easy part, right?

100
00:06:09.376 --> 00:06:12.908
Like writing code that does stuff is something that

101
00:06:12.908 --> 00:06:14.774
we're all reasonably good at.

102
00:06:14.774 --> 00:06:16.576
We can download a module.

103
00:06:16.576 --> 00:06:18.164
We can dig through the documentation.

104
00:06:18.164 --> 00:06:20.017
We can figure out how it works.

105
00:06:20.017 --> 00:06:24.523
What is not necessarily super well understood is how you fit all

106
00:06:24.523 --> 00:06:29.056
those pieces together in an actual code base that builds an

107
00:06:29.056 --> 00:06:32.245
application and solves a problem for a user.

108
00:06:32.245 --> 00:06:32.638
So,

109
00:06:32.638 --> 00:06:37.158
the goal of this workshop is to get everybody in here

110
00:06:37.158 --> 00:06:39.914
walking away with a starting point.

111
00:06:39.914 --> 00:06:43.567
I imagine that all of us will want to customize some of the

112
00:06:43.567 --> 00:06:45.651
components that we'll find here quite a bit.

113
00:06:45.651 --> 00:06:50.462
But I would like us to at least walk away with a starting point that

114
00:06:50.462 --> 00:06:53.485
has productive development environment that you can iterate on

115
00:06:53.485 --> 00:06:58.190
quickly as you're building features and also one that won't fall over

116
00:06:58.190 --> 00:07:00.796
under a reasonable amount of load.

117
00:07:00.796 --> 00:07:03.187
We're not going to be creating a deployment

118
00:07:03.187 --> 00:07:05.132
infrastructure to run Netflix or Twitter,

119
00:07:05.132 --> 00:07:08.279
but we should be able to understand what the

120
00:07:08.279 --> 00:07:10.858
performance ceiling is of our application,

121
00:07:10.858 --> 00:07:16.911
and we'll hopefully leave today with the tools to understand what that is.

122
00:07:16.911 --> 00:07:20.098
So, we'll be walking through a sample project,

123
00:07:20.098 --> 00:07:24.374
which uses a structure which is very similar to what you

124
00:07:24.374 --> 00:07:27.097
might find in a production Node application,

125
00:07:27.097 --> 00:07:30.901
uses a lot of the same techniques and tools,

126
00:07:30.901 --> 00:07:34.316
and is something that you can build on as a template to

127
00:07:34.316 --> 00:07:36.065
build your own production Node application.

128
00:07:36.065 --> 00:07:40.949
Over the next two days, you'll notice we're not going too deep on any one module.

129
00:07:40.949 --> 00:07:42.376
We'll talking a little bit about Express,

130
00:07:42.376 --> 00:07:45.142
we'll be talking a little bit about Sequelize and Postgres,

131
00:07:45.142 --> 00:07:49.687
we'll be talking a little bit about Grunt and npm run

132
00:07:49.687 --> 00:07:53.888
scripts and some of the command line tooling,

133
00:07:53.888 --> 00:07:54.481
but again,

134
00:07:54.481 --> 00:07:59.341
the objective here is to get a sense of like what are all the pieces that

135
00:07:59.341 --> 00:08:02.749
you'll need to bring together to actually deploy a Node.

136
00:08:02.749 --> 00:08:03.938
js web application.

137
00:08:03.938 --> 00:08:08.971
The other bit that I wanted to expose you to with this

138
00:08:08.971 --> 00:08:12.706
content is usage of newer ES2015, ES2016,

139
00:08:12.706 --> 00:08:15.459
whatever you want to call it,

140
00:08:15.459 --> 00:08:19.818
features of the JavaScript programming language that are showing up in Node 6,

141
00:08:19.818 --> 00:08:24.215
which is the version of Node that I wrote tested this content against.

142
00:08:24.215 --> 00:08:30.421
And using transforms, we can actually also use that same code in the browser,

143
00:08:30.421 --> 00:08:34.804
so I wanted to give you a little bit of exposure to those new

144
00:08:34.804 --> 00:08:39.410
JavaScript programming language features that you may or may not have

145
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:41.936
started to use in your own applications already.

146
00:08:41.936 --> 00:08:45.687
But mostly, the most important bit is that bit down on the bottom there,

147
00:08:45.687 --> 00:08:49.004
is taking the time to write code.

148
00:08:49.004 --> 00:08:53.152
The collective opportunity cost of everybody here in the room

149
00:08:53.152 --> 00:08:56.268
and of the 50 people online is tremendous.

150
00:08:56.268 --> 00:09:02.137
There's nothing more valuable in the world than an hour of developer's time.

151
00:09:02.137 --> 00:09:02.701
So number one,

152
00:09:02.701 --> 00:09:05.800
I really appreciate you spending that time here with me and learning about Node.

153
00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:06.104
js.

154
00:09:06.104 --> 00:09:07.017
And number two,

155
00:09:07.017 --> 00:09:10.809
I think that the best investment of that time is just

156
00:09:10.809 --> 00:09:12.702
getting soak time writing code.

157
00:09:12.702 --> 00:09:17.609
There's no substitute for actually digging into code,

158
00:09:17.609 --> 00:09:20.255
debugging stuff, referencing documentation,

159
00:09:20.255 --> 00:09:22.383
figuring things out.

160
00:09:22.383 --> 00:09:25.351
So this workshop experience has been optimized to allow you

161
00:09:25.351 --> 00:09:28.788
to write lots of code with support from everybody here in

162
00:09:28.788 --> 00:09:39.000
this room and support from me, but really to get you that time in repetition. You will be your own best teacher here in the next two days.
