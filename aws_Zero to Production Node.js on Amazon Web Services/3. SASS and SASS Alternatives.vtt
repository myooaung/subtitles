00:00:04.100 --> 00:00:09.136
The other key player in our front-end toolchain is Sass.

2
00:00:09.136 --> 00:00:14.663
Sass provides a superset of CSS features, as I said.

3
00:00:14.663 --> 00:00:21.422
If you write just plain CSS, that is also a valid Sass or SCSS style sheet,

4
00:00:21.422 --> 00:00:27.569
but it provides a lot more functionality that --- I'm sorry

5
00:00:27.569 --> 00:00:30.946
Browserify --- up in the chat James actually corrected me.

6
00:00:30.946 --> 00:00:36.401
The Browserify stuff in this project is largely --- is in the Gruntfile,

7
00:00:36.401 --> 00:00:41.170
but some of the transform configuration is in the package.

8
00:00:41.170 --> 00:00:41.647
json.

9
00:00:41.647 --> 00:00:45.524
So some of the Browserify transforms expect to find

10
00:00:45.524 --> 00:00:47.128
their configuration in package.

11
00:00:47.128 --> 00:00:49.474
json, which is why that's there.

12
00:00:49.474 --> 00:00:54.213
But the transformations are actually configured in the Gruntfile,

13
00:00:54.213 --> 00:00:57.340
I think, in this instance.

14
00:00:57.340 --> 00:01:01.093
Thank you for the clarification there.

15
00:01:01.093 --> 00:01:03.794
Alright, so in terms of Sass,

16
00:01:03.794 --> 00:01:09.488
we have --- it gives us the ability to better modularize our CSS essentially.

17
00:01:09.488 --> 00:01:14.028
It allows us to write our CSS like we would write our code.

18
00:01:14.028 --> 00:01:14.401
So,

19
00:01:14.401 --> 00:01:18.576
in our code we wouldn't write the same thing over and over

20
00:01:18.576 --> 00:01:20.449
and over again for different classes,

21
00:01:20.449 --> 00:01:23.374
but in CSS that's essentially what you have to do.

22
00:01:23.374 --> 00:01:28.374
If you want to use --- you'll find that you're using the font

23
00:01:28.374 --> 00:01:30.022
family declaration for multiple elements,

24
00:01:30.022 --> 00:01:34.491
and it's possible to write CSS such that you don't repeat yourself a lot,

25
00:01:34.491 --> 00:01:36.750
but invariably you end up doing that.

26
00:01:36.750 --> 00:01:40.307
So Sass provides the ability to create things called mixins,

27
00:01:40.307 --> 00:01:45.409
which allows you to have better modularization in your JavaScript code,

28
00:01:45.409 --> 00:01:47.605
or in your, excuse me, your Sass code.

29
00:01:47.605 --> 00:01:53.950
So you can essentially integrate sets of functionality into your CSS and

30
00:01:53.950 --> 00:02:00.221
like sort of reuse those mixins all across your Sass code.

31
00:02:00.221 --> 00:02:09.113
The other bit that it allows you to do is to specify variables and import

32
00:02:09.113 --> 00:02:14.811
external Sass style sheets basically anywhere within your Sass.

33
00:02:14.811 --> 00:02:16.383
Both are fairly critical features,

34
00:02:16.383 --> 00:02:19.226
especially like when you're talking about colors and

35
00:02:19.226 --> 00:02:21.769
other sort of sitewide design elements.

36
00:02:21.769 --> 00:02:25.585
Being able to assign those to variables that you can use in multiple

37
00:02:25.585 --> 00:02:28.684
places and then change once and then watch those changes propagate

38
00:02:28.684 --> 00:02:33.014
everywhere in your styles ends up being pretty clutch.

39
00:02:33.014 --> 00:02:37.407
Sass also comes with a fast C-based compiler,

40
00:02:37.407 --> 00:02:40.894
so it's fairly performant when you're actually

41
00:02:40.894 --> 00:02:43.655
compiling those style sheets as well.

42
00:02:43.655 --> 00:02:48.947
Can you talk a little bit about advantages or disadvantages of Sass over LESS?

43
00:02:48.947 --> 00:02:53.335
Yeah, I mean actually that's a --- we'll just skip ahead just a little bit.

44
00:02:53.335 --> 00:03:00.690
So it's fairly interchangeable with LESS in terms of style.

45
00:03:00.690 --> 00:03:04.540
I think it comes down to preference largely.

46
00:03:04.540 --> 00:03:06.060
Sass is cross-platform.

47
00:03:06.060 --> 00:03:08.593
I think LESS is Node.

48
00:03:08.593 --> 00:03:11.632
js only, if I'm not mistaken.

49
00:03:11.632 --> 00:03:13.982
You can probably use it everywhere.

50
00:03:13.982 --> 00:03:18.347
I'm sure it'll work just fine with other environments as well, but yeah.

51
00:03:18.347 --> 00:03:19.257
I'm going to extend that question.

52
00:03:19.257 --> 00:03:21.859
Why wouldn't you use something like Bootstrap 3 and

53
00:03:21.859 --> 00:03:25.083
jQuery UI for some of this stuff?

54
00:03:25.083 --> 00:03:25.899
So those tools,

55
00:03:25.899 --> 00:03:29.467
like the question if you didn't hear it was why wouldn't you

56
00:03:29.467 --> 00:03:33.285
Bootstrap 3 or jQuery UI for stuff like this?

57
00:03:33.285 --> 00:03:35.599
And those tools actually serve a slightly different purpose.

58
00:03:35.599 --> 00:03:40.826
So like jQuery UI does provide a set of CSS classes that you

59
00:03:40.826 --> 00:03:45.788
can apply to objects to make them look nice and turn into

60
00:03:45.788 --> 00:03:47.867
drop-downs and stuff like that.

61
00:03:47.867 --> 00:03:51.292
But for authoring your own styles for your own components,

62
00:03:51.292 --> 00:03:55.564
you probably will be authoring CSS from scratch anyway,

63
00:03:55.564 --> 00:03:59.569
and Bootstrap and jQuery UI help with some prebuilt

64
00:03:59.569 --> 00:04:02.521
classes that you can use for grids,

65
00:04:02.521 --> 00:04:06.565
and those tools work really well with Sass or LESS.

66
00:04:06.565 --> 00:04:11.555
In fact, Bootstrap, one of the things that you can do if you're using Sass,

67
00:04:11.555 --> 00:04:15.807
and I know at one point they had LESS styles as well,

68
00:04:15.807 --> 00:04:20.211
but I feel like at maybe at one point they converted to Sass.

69
00:04:20.211 --> 00:04:22.542
I'll have to check on that specifically.

70
00:04:22.542 --> 00:04:26.231
But if you actually download the Bootstrap Sass files,

71
00:04:26.231 --> 00:04:33.594
you could import them into your own styles and use only the parts of the

72
00:04:33.594 --> 00:04:38.827
Bootstrap styles that you're actually like leveraging in your application

73
00:04:38.827 --> 00:04:45.308
and which ends up being a little lighter weight than including a larger

74
00:04:45.308 --> 00:04:47.365
package that you didn't customize.

75
00:04:47.365 --> 00:04:52.444
There are also similar to Bootstrap is a framework called UIkit,

76
00:04:52.444 --> 00:04:55.313
which I would definitely recommend you check out,

77
00:04:55.313 --> 00:04:57.595
which provides a set of Sass,

78
00:04:57.595 --> 00:05:01.834
like Sass mixins and other bits that you can actually

79
00:05:01.834 --> 00:05:06.226
include in your own CSS to create like CSS3

80
00:05:06.226 --> 00:05:09.202
transformations and useful things like that.

81
00:05:09.202 --> 00:05:15.065
So it provides useful mixins, responsive breakpoints, and stuff like that.

82
00:05:15.065 --> 00:05:15.498
Thank you.

83
00:05:15.498 --> 00:05:17.314
Yep, no problem.

84
00:05:17.314 --> 00:05:22.762
But yeah, so LESS serves largely the same purpose,

85
00:05:22.762 --> 00:05:24.763
and it's fairly interchangeable.

86
00:05:24.763 --> 00:05:31.668
At this point, it's --- for me, it's more a preference thing.

87
00:05:31.668 --> 00:05:35.750
I like Sass a little better.

88
00:05:35.750 --> 00:05:40.045
And webpack, as long we're here on the alternate tip,

89
00:05:40.045 --> 00:05:43.865
is --- also provides like module bundling functionality

90
00:05:43.865 --> 00:05:47.641
based on the new ECMAScript module system.

91
00:05:47.641 --> 00:05:53.958
It also provides some other module bundling features and functionality,

92
00:05:53.958 --> 00:06:01.407
also fully legit, also has a growing set of plugins.

93
00:06:01.407 --> 00:06:06.163
And I think at this point, like because Browserify has been around longer,

94
00:06:06.163 --> 00:06:09.974
I think it has a richer set of transformations and plugins

95
00:06:09.974 --> 00:06:13.095
that can be brought to bear using Browserify,

96
00:06:13.095 --> 00:06:24.000
but webpack has a large and thriving community of plugin developers as well. So again, fully a valid choice if you want to go in that direction.
