00:00:04.033 --> 00:00:07.498
And as we've always done, we talk about the alternatives.

2
00:00:07.498 --> 00:00:11.258
Obviously, if you go with a Platform as a Service like Heroku,

3
00:00:11.258 --> 00:00:17.602
it's fully managed, your DevOps responsibilities are virtually nil,

4
00:00:17.602 --> 00:00:20.542
but it tends to cost a lot of money at scale,

5
00:00:20.542 --> 00:00:24.842
whereas if you go to the other extreme, managing your own infrastructure,

6
00:00:24.842 --> 00:00:28.260
what you don't get is this orchestration software.

7
00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:31.379
So like when you do an EB deploy,

8
00:00:31.379 --> 00:00:34.440
like there's no management software that's going to take

9
00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:37.233
some of your instances out of the fleet,

10
00:00:37.233 --> 00:00:41.553
update them, put them back in, and do those changes for you.

11
00:00:41.553 --> 00:00:41.919
So,

12
00:00:41.919 --> 00:00:45.562
there's lots of other open source software in Amazon tools

13
00:00:45.562 --> 00:00:48.099
that you can use to accomplish this,

14
00:00:48.099 --> 00:00:52.113
but that is essentially the value that Elastic Beanstalk provides is

15
00:00:52.113 --> 00:00:56.681
that even though it is kind of a pain to set up,

16
00:00:56.681 --> 00:01:02.590
once it is set up, the orchestration that you get is actually pretty strong.

17
00:01:02.590 --> 00:01:05.501
There's just generally if --- the more control you have over the infrastructure,

18
00:01:05.501 --> 00:01:08.400
the more DevOps you're going to have to do.

19
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.584
And really what this comes down to is resources, right?

20
00:01:11.584 --> 00:01:16.207
Like if operating your service at scale is more expensive

21
00:01:16.207 --> 00:01:19.130
than the time you might spend on DevOps,

22
00:01:19.130 --> 00:01:22.925
then that's the time when you're going to want to probably manage

23
00:01:22.925 --> 00:01:26.300
your infrastructure versus if time is more precious than the ---

24
00:01:26.300 --> 00:01:30.210
time is more expensive than the amount of money you would spend

25
00:01:30.210 --> 00:01:31.138
on server infrastructure,

26
00:01:31.138 --> 00:01:35.605
then going with something like a pass is probably a wiser choice.

27
00:01:35.605 --> 00:01:39.225
And Elastic Beanstalk is kind of in the middle.

28
00:01:39.225 --> 00:01:48.000
It's the gateway between something like Heroku and a fully self-managed EC2 environment.
