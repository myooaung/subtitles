00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.390

alright notice I mentioned in the end of



2

00:00:07.390 --> 00:00:09.880

the at the end of the last video we're



3

00:00:09.880 --> 00:00:11.200

now going to work on the left hand block



4

00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:12.820

and that's going to become a mirror



5

00:00:12.820 --> 00:00:15.670

image of the buttons on the right so



6

00:00:15.670 --> 00:00:17.590

each button there should have a baseline



7

00:00:17.590 --> 00:00:20.050

constraint to the button on its right so



8

00:00:20.050 --> 00:00:22.390

seven to eight but also eight to nine



9

00:00:22.390 --> 00:00:25.480

and so on down the rows so let's start



10

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:26.680

by doing that so we're going to start



11

00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:29.710

with seven we're going to create a



12

00:00:29.710 --> 00:00:34.629

baseline constraint to that date and



13

00:00:34.629 --> 00:00:36.039

also as I mentioned we want to set a



14

00:00:36.039 --> 00:00:37.949

baseline constraint from eight to nine



15

00:00:37.949 --> 00:00:40.030

because obviously all the buttons we



16

00:00:40.030 --> 00:00:42.460

want to have on the same or at the same



17

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:48.839

position horizontally right then four



18

00:00:48.839 --> 00:00:52.359

we're going to paste constrain that to



19

00:00:52.359 --> 00:00:56.920

the 5 then five you're going to create



20

00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.280

the base constraint to six and you can



21

00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:01.839

see that I'm not having to move through



22

00:01:01.839 --> 00:01:03.370

widgets they're moving themselves as I'm



23

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:12.750

doing this



24

00:01:12.750 --> 00:01:16.630

and then zero I'm quite a baseline



25

00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:21.700

constraint to this one over here oops oh



26

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.070

you can see I actually didn't wait till



27

00:01:24.070 --> 00:01:25.750

it flashed correctly then I'm going to



28

00:01:25.750 --> 00:01:28.630

do it again in reposition that this does



29

00:01:28.630 --> 00:01:30.009

happen sometimes you notice that I went



30

00:01:30.009 --> 00:01:31.479

to dragon and it didn't work so you just



31

00:01:31.479 --> 00:01:32.530

come back and do it again and it



32

00:01:32.530 --> 00:01:34.600

normally fixes itself on the second time



33

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.390

all right last one now for the button



34

00:01:37.390 --> 00:01:40.780

dot we want to do a base constraint for



35

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:45.130

that to the equal sign okay so we've



36

00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:47.170

done that to the left hand block so next



37

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:48.340

what we need to do is we need to



38

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:50.410

constrain the right edge of each button



39

00:01:50.410 --> 00:01:53.470

on the first column to the left edge of



40

00:01:53.470 --> 00:01:55.869

the button to us right so it's 7 to 8 4



41

00:01:55.869 --> 00:01:58.270

to 5 and so on let's go ahead and do



42

00:01:58.270 --> 00:02:00.700

that so I'm going to start with 7 so 7



43

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:11.200

to 8 4 to 5 1 to 2 and then there's 0 to



44

00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:14.620

the dot or the period okay so that's



45

00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:16.900

those 4 done now to line them up



46

00:02:16.900 --> 00:02:19.000

vertically each button in the second



47

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:21.690

column starting with 5 and working down



48

00:02:21.690 --> 00:02:25.030

so if it's right edge constrained to the



49

00:02:25.030 --> 00:02:26.739

right edge of the button above it



50

00:02:26.739 --> 00:02:28.690

let's go ahead and do that so study with



51

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:31.799

the 5 constrain it to the right of the 8



52

00:02:31.799 --> 00:02:34.269

and we get that stepped effect as I



53

00:02:34.269 --> 00:02:35.530

mentioned before but we'll change the



54

00:02:35.530 --> 00:02:40.060

margins for that shortly and then the



55

00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:46.560

dot will constraint it - oops



56

00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:49.360

like so and we just need to change the



57

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:53.530

margins to 0 again so 5 come over here



58

00:02:53.530 --> 00:02:55.230

and change the margin to 0



59

00:02:55.230 --> 00:03:00.790

same for the 2 well 2 0 and also same



60

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:05.170

for the dot change it to 0 like so so



61

00:03:05.170 --> 00:03:06.519

we've removed the stepped effect from



62

00:03:06.519 --> 00:03:07.030

that as well



63

00:03:07.030 --> 00:03:09.549

all right so at this point now but Nate



64

00:03:09.549 --> 00:03:10.810

should be able to be dragged sideways



65

00:03:10.810 --> 00:03:12.459

and all the other buttons on that side



66

00:03:12.459 --> 00:03:15.730

should follow so we just try that we can



67

00:03:15.730 --> 00:03:16.840

see that we've got they're all moving



68

00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:19.209

nicely now none of the buttons on this



69

00:03:19.209 --> 00:03:20.650

side can be dragged up or down because



70

00:03:20.650 --> 00:03:22.359

of the baseline constraints to their



71

00:03:22.359 --> 00:03:23.390

right



72

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:25.550

okay you can't click on seven and move



73

00:03:25.550 --> 00:03:26.840

that up and down because of the way that



74

00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:28.100

we've first set up they're based on



75

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:29.930

constraints which is what we want here



76

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.720

all right so the final two constraints



77

00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:34.250

now we need to do is we need to



78

00:03:34.250 --> 00:03:36.440

constrain the left edge of button nine



79

00:03:36.440 --> 00:03:39.020

to the guideline then the right edge of



80

00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:40.970

button eight to the left of button 9



81

00:03:40.970 --> 00:03:43.250

which will fix the left hand block in



82

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:47.060

place let's start with button 9 we want



83

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.560

to constrain the left edge of button on



84

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:53.450

to the guideline look so and then what



85

00:03:53.450 --> 00:03:55.130

we want to do is get the right edge of



86

00:03:55.130 --> 00:03:57.470

but Nate I can selecting that we want to



87

00:03:57.470 --> 00:03:59.570

constrain that to the left edge of



88

00:03:59.570 --> 00:04:05.810

button 9 not to the guideline like so so



89

00:04:05.810 --> 00:04:08.420

that no fixes in left block in place now



90

00:04:08.420 --> 00:04:10.730

I've connected button nose left edge to



91

00:04:10.730 --> 00:04:12.530

the guide line we're going to just click



92

00:04:12.530 --> 00:04:16.930

it we want the margin here to be 4 DP I



93

00:04:16.930 --> 00:04:20.480

was just going to type in 4 here press



94

00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:20.989

Enter



95

00:04:20.989 --> 00:04:23.540

and we've already can edit our



96

00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:25.310

constraint from the right edge of button



97

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.530

8 to the left edge of button 9 and we



98

00:04:27.530 --> 00:04:28.550

want to just check that and make sure



99

00:04:28.550 --> 00:04:31.880

that the width there the margin rather



100

00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.280

is 8 I'm a combination of making that 8



101

00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:37.460

and making this one for buck 9 means



102

00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.310

that things line up nicely now right now



103

00:04:40.310 --> 00:04:41.930

there's nothing constraining the button



104

00:04:41.930 --> 00:04:44.090

group vertically so we want to constrain



105

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:46.970

the top of button 9 to the bottom of one



106

00:04:46.970 --> 00:04:48.710

of the edit text widgets



107

00:04:48.710 --> 00:04:50.000

it's imagine the weight so I'm gonna



108

00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.360

click on that I'm going to constrain



109

00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:58.790

this to the result like so and we just



110

00:04:58.790 --> 00:04:59.870

want to make sure we've got a margin of



111

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:01.460

eight there which we have got and



112

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:02.780

obviously that constraints all the



113

00:05:02.780 --> 00:05:04.820

buttons when I've done that so at this



114

00:05:04.820 --> 00:05:06.650

point now we've got a grid of buttons



115

00:05:06.650 --> 00:05:09.080

that are all constrained so that they



116

00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.330

work as a single block of widgets with



117

00:05:11.330 --> 00:05:12.860

button known as the widget that they're



118

00:05:12.860 --> 00:05:15.440

ultimately constrained to then we can't



119

00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.380

test this by dragging 9 around as it



120

00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:19.820

moves you can see all the other buttons



121

00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:24.169

are actually moving as well now if any



122

00:05:24.169 --> 00:05:25.940

buttons get left behind then check that



123

00:05:25.940 --> 00:05:27.620

they've been correctly constrained and



124

00:05:27.620 --> 00:05:31.160

when you finish testing yes I have move



125

00:05:31.160 --> 00:05:32.539

them back close to where you think they



126

00:05:32.539 --> 00:05:34.729

should be and just check button 9 so



127

00:05:34.729 --> 00:05:36.889

click on that and you want to check that



128

00:05:36.889 --> 00:05:39.469

but noise top margin is on ATP mines



129

00:05:39.469 --> 00:05:42.289

currently set to 69 it to eight and also



130

00:05:42.289 --> 00:05:45.759

the left margin should be set to four



131

00:05:45.759 --> 00:05:48.259

and by doing that that centers all the



132

00:05:48.259 --> 00:05:50.659

buttons with the guide line appearing



133

00:05:50.659 --> 00:05:52.210

right down the middle of both of them



134

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:54.620

all right so let's now try running this



135

00:05:54.620 --> 00:05:56.930

just to check that our application still



136

00:05:56.930 --> 00:06:00.560

works and if things look ok nervously



137

00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:02.150

we'll start up in portrait mode and that



138

00:06:02.150 --> 00:06:04.099

should be fine and should be no nothing



139

00:06:04.099 --> 00:06:05.779

should have changed there because we



140

00:06:05.779 --> 00:06:07.340

haven't been working on that to layout



141

00:06:07.340 --> 00:06:09.830

but it's the landscape line that we want



142

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:11.509

to check to make sure that's now working



143

00:06:11.509 --> 00:06:13.490

and looking okay so let's move over to



144

00:06:13.490 --> 00:06:17.000

landscape and you can see that it's



145

00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.379

looking quite good at the moment looks



146

00:06:18.379 --> 00:06:20.659

quite centered now there's a widget we



147

00:06:20.659 --> 00:06:22.520

haven't constrained and that's the



148

00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:24.650

operation text view and that's appearing



149

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:25.939

at the top of the screen here in the top



150

00:06:25.939 --> 00:06:27.710

left-hand corner which is the default



151

00:06:27.710 --> 00:06:29.839

operation if there isn't any constraints



152

00:06:29.839 --> 00:06:32.419

and by the way if you can't see it tap



153

00:06:32.419 --> 00:06:34.069

one of the operation buttons to give it



154

00:06:34.069 --> 00:06:37.129

some text so just slash will divider a



155

00:06:37.129 --> 00:06:38.330

plasterer you will be able to see where



156

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.849

it is on the screen again top left is



157

00:06:40.849 --> 00:06:43.279

where unconstrained widgets appear so we



158

00:06:43.279 --> 00:06:44.750

need to obviously go back and constrain



159

00:06:44.750 --> 00:06:46.610

that however you probably kind of have a



160

00:06:46.610 --> 00:06:48.020

problem finding in the layout let's



161

00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:49.550

actually just go back and have a look in



162

00:06:49.550 --> 00:06:52.669

Android studio you can see it over here



163

00:06:52.669 --> 00:06:55.219

so sometimes it can be very hard to tell



164

00:06:55.219 --> 00:06:56.930

where that widgets gone or a widget like



165

00:06:56.930 --> 00:06:59.029

that that hasn't got any text even



166

00:06:59.029 --> 00:07:00.649

selecting it in the component tree may



167

00:07:00.649 --> 00:07:02.870

not actually help in some cases trying



168

00:07:02.870 --> 00:07:04.490

to select it can be quite finicky in



169

00:07:04.490 --> 00:07:06.649

other words now I mentioned the tools



170

00:07:06.649 --> 00:07:09.169

attribute earlier and this is a good use



171

00:07:09.169 --> 00:07:11.599

for one of them the tools text so to



172

00:07:11.599 --> 00:07:13.129

show you what I mean I'm going to click



173

00:07:13.129 --> 00:07:15.139

on the component tree I'm gonna select



174

00:07:15.139 --> 00:07:18.050

operation and you can see that -



175

00:07:18.050 --> 00:07:19.639

obviously by doing that that's now while



176

00:07:19.639 --> 00:07:21.649

showing but it's still very fiddly to



177

00:07:21.649 --> 00:07:24.199

try and get access to so this is where



178

00:07:24.199 --> 00:07:26.689

the tools attributes come in handy so



179

00:07:26.689 --> 00:07:28.279

I've selected that using the component



180

00:07:28.279 --> 00:07:30.169

tree and then what I want to do is enter



181

00:07:30.169 --> 00:07:32.839

some text down here in text but this one



182

00:07:32.839 --> 00:07:35.750

the one with the the tools or the wrench



183

00:07:35.750 --> 00:07:38.089

or the spanner to the left of it now I'm



184

00:07:38.089 --> 00:07:40.069

going to be very unimaginative and type



185

00:07:40.069 --> 00:07:45.529

in operation and the widget will only



186

00:07:45.529 --> 00:07:46.940

contain it will only have a single



187

00:07:46.940 --> 00:07:48.680

character when we run the app but we



188

00:07:48.680 --> 00:07:50.720

tried but when trying to fire



189

00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:52.490

so slightly longer text will make that a



190

00:07:52.490 --> 00:07:54.530

lot easier and you can see obviously the



191

00:07:54.530 --> 00:07:56.240

word operation is appearing on the



192

00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:59.660

layout now and just a reminder here the



193

00:07:59.660 --> 00:08:01.280

text won't appear when we run the app



194

00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:03.260

tools attributes the ones that are



195

00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:05.720

marked with a wrench or spanner they're



196

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.120

only used in the designer all right so



197

00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:10.580

at this point in time it's time for a



198

00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:14.150

challenge all right so the the mini



199

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:15.620

challenge here is to provide suitable



200

00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.530

constraints for the operation textview



201

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:20.600

widget that's appearing over at the top



202

00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:22.280

left hand side of the screen when we run



203

00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:24.890

the app in landscape now you can decide



204

00:08:24.890 --> 00:08:27.110

exactly where you want it but my



205

00:08:27.110 --> 00:08:28.760

solution will Center it in a space



206

00:08:28.760 --> 00:08:31.250

between the left of button 7 and the



207

00:08:31.250 --> 00:08:34.130

left edge of new number so that's your



208

00:08:34.130 --> 00:08:35.419

challenge pause the video and see how



209

00:08:35.419 --> 00:08:37.130

you go with that and when you're ready



210

00:08:37.130 --> 00:08:39.289

to see my solution come back and I'll go



211

00:08:39.289 --> 00:08:43.490

through that so pause the video now all



212

00:08:43.490 --> 00:08:44.450

right so I'm going to do what I



213

00:08:44.450 --> 00:08:46.970

suggested in the challenge so firstly



214

00:08:46.970 --> 00:08:48.980

we're going to make sure that operation



215

00:08:48.980 --> 00:08:51.110

is selected and we're going to constrain



216

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:53.930

the operation textview to the baseline



217

00:08:53.930 --> 00:09:00.250

of button 7 let's go ahead and do that



218

00:09:00.250 --> 00:09:03.410

like so next we're going to constrain



219

00:09:03.410 --> 00:09:05.690

it's right edge to the left edge of



220

00:09:05.690 --> 00:09:11.360

button 7 let's go ahead and do that and



221

00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:12.950

then I'm going to constrain the left



222

00:09:12.950 --> 00:09:15.790

edge to the left edge of a new number



223

00:09:15.790 --> 00:09:21.080

over here like so so that's the textview



224

00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:23.030

constraint both vertically and



225

00:09:23.030 --> 00:09:25.250

horizontally and you just want to check



226

00:09:25.250 --> 00:09:27.110

the margins to make sure that they are



227

00:09:27.110 --> 00:09:29.630

centered you can see we've got 8 DP for



228

00:09:29.630 --> 00:09:31.400

the left and ATP for the right so that's



229

00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:34.339

fine new at this point of time you can



230

00:09:34.339 --> 00:09:37.070

replace the tools text to better



231

00:09:37.070 --> 00:09:38.990

represent the running app so we'll go



232

00:09:38.990 --> 00:09:40.160

ahead and do that we'll change the



233

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:41.780

operation let's just use a plus as the



234

00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:43.640

default because obviously that's going



235

00:09:43.640 --> 00:09:46.100

to be more consistent to as to what it's



236

00:09:46.100 --> 00:09:47.660

going to look like when running the or



237

00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:50.089

when running the app so let's now just



238

00:09:50.089 --> 00:09:51.770

run the app to make sure that this



239

00:09:51.770 --> 00:09:52.580

actually works



240

00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.350

it sounds constrained and looking



241

00:09:54.350 --> 00:09:58.610

correct you can see we landscape mode if



242

00:09:58.610 --> 00:10:01.400

we type something now we can see that



243

00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.190

we've got that working nicely



244

00:10:04.190 --> 00:10:06.120

all right so we'll go back now to



245

00:10:06.120 --> 00:10:08.760

Android studio now even with a separate



246

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.950

layout for landscape mode the layout



247

00:10:10.950 --> 00:10:12.660

won't fit on something like a nexus one



248

00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:14.610

as we've designed it we're wasting a lot



249

00:10:14.610 --> 00:10:17.250

of space in landscape now rather than



250

00:10:17.250 --> 00:10:19.230

trying to reduce all the top margins to



251

00:10:19.230 --> 00:10:21.779

close everything up it may make more



252

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:23.730

sense to leave a row of buttons and



253

00:10:23.730 --> 00:10:26.760

redesign the keypad so that it's only 3



254

00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.250

buttons deep now one advantage of having



255

00:10:29.250 --> 00:10:30.899

a separate layer for the different



256

00:10:30.899 --> 00:10:32.820

orientations is that you can take



257

00:10:32.820 --> 00:10:34.709

advantage of the extra space available



258

00:10:34.709 --> 00:10:36.330

rather than having to try and cram



259

00:10:36.330 --> 00:10:38.760

everything into a narrow space but to



260

00:10:38.760 --> 00:10:40.980

one disadvantage as I mentioned is that



261

00:10:40.980 --> 00:10:42.779

you then have two layouts to maintain



262

00:10:42.779 --> 00:10:44.520

you know whenever you make changes such



263

00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:47.010

as adding another button alright so



264

00:10:47.010 --> 00:10:48.720

we've now covered a lot of what you can



265

00:10:48.720 --> 00:10:50.640

do with the constraint layout and if you



266

00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:52.680

make a copy of the XML first you can



267

00:10:52.680 --> 00:10:55.320

experiment with different designs until



268

00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:56.660

you get something you're happy with them



269

00:10:56.660 --> 00:10:59.459

also remember that control Z or command



270

00:10:59.459 --> 00:11:02.339

Z on a mac will undo each successive



271

00:11:02.339 --> 00:11:03.720

change that you've made so you can keep



272

00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:06.420

pressing that to go back with all - all



273

00:11:06.420 --> 00:11:08.579

the changes you've made and what I'm



274

00:11:08.579 --> 00:11:10.200

going to do is finish this section with



275

00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:11.910

a challenge but first I'm going to



276

00:11:11.910 --> 00:11:13.440

switch over to the text tab for this



277

00:11:13.440 --> 00:11:16.200

layout and I click on the reformat code



278

00:11:16.200 --> 00:11:20.180

from the code menu just so it's nicely



279

00:11:20.180 --> 00:11:22.079

formatted you can see that we've got a



280

00:11:22.079 --> 00:11:23.820

message briefly appeared to say that -



281

00:11:23.820 --> 00:11:26.279

it was already okay so let's have a look



282

00:11:26.279 --> 00:11:30.029

at that challenge alright so one thing



283

00:11:30.029 --> 00:11:31.470

that's missing from the calculator app



284

00:11:31.470 --> 00:11:34.200

is the ability to enter negative numbers



285

00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:36.660

for calculations now because of the way



286

00:11:36.660 --> 00:11:39.029

that the operations button buttons work



287

00:11:39.029 --> 00:11:41.399

you can't just use the minus button to



288

00:11:41.399 --> 00:11:43.589

do that so the challenge is to add



289

00:11:43.589 --> 00:11:45.899

another button to negate the input



290

00:11:45.899 --> 00:11:47.850

number you know if there's no number



291

00:11:47.850 --> 00:11:49.350

entered then the button should put a



292

00:11:49.350 --> 00:11:51.570

minus sign in the input so that any



293

00:11:51.570 --> 00:11:53.390

subsequent input will be negative



294

00:11:53.390 --> 00:11:55.500

anytime the button is clicked the



295

00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:57.750

numbers should be negated so a negative



296

00:11:57.750 --> 00:12:00.350

number becomes positive and vice-versa



297

00:12:00.350 --> 00:12:02.970

now if a blank input it should toggle a



298

00:12:02.970 --> 00:12:05.790

leading minus sign on and off now if you



299

00:12:05.790 --> 00:12:07.260

want to use text for the button for



300

00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:09.600

example neg and now have a look at the



301

00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:11.130

font properties at the bottom of the



302

00:12:11.130 --> 00:12:13.500

panel to the right you may want to make



303

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.209

the font sizes smaller so the button can



304

00:12:15.209 --> 00:12:16.900

be the same size as the current ones



305

00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.250

now there's no need to center the button



306

00:12:19.250 --> 00:12:21.740

grid but I will go through one way to do



307

00:12:21.740 --> 00:12:23.780

that in the solution and just as a hint



308

00:12:23.780 --> 00:12:25.370

it doesn't involve using another



309

00:12:25.370 --> 00:12:28.190

guideline and another hint one button



310

00:12:28.190 --> 00:12:30.290

can be centered and use this the key



311

00:12:30.290 --> 00:12:31.690

button that all others are anchored to



312

00:12:31.690 --> 00:12:33.560

all right so I'm going to stop this



313

00:12:33.560 --> 00:12:35.300

video here and we'll go through my



314

00:12:35.300 --> 00:12:36.980

solution to this challenge in the next



315

00:12:36.980 --> 00:12:39.400

video
