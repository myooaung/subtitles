00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:07.120

alright so in the last video we ended up



2

00:00:07.120 --> 00:00:10.210

by changing the user input and button



3

00:00:10.210 --> 00:00:13.059

variables to vowels instead of bars and



4

00:00:13.059 --> 00:00:14.860

consequently we were able to remove the



5

00:00:14.860 --> 00:00:17.260

question marks and that's because they



6

00:00:17.260 --> 00:00:18.880

no longer need it was no longer needing



7

00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:21.220

to be writable so we can access the



8

00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:22.600

properties in without using question



9

00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.580

marks and you can see that we did that



10

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:28.630

runs a lot on line 18 and 19 and then we



11

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.110

also made a change on line 26 if you use



12

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:33.280

them input.txt



13

00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:37.659

dot t-- EXT okay so what i've done there



14

00:00:37.659 --> 00:00:40.690

is made both user input and button local



15

00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:44.050

variables in the uncreate function and



16

00:00:44.050 --> 00:00:44.920

that means that they're not available



17

00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:47.469

anywhere else in the class only inside



18

00:00:47.469 --> 00:00:50.289

the uncreate function we've left



19

00:00:50.289 --> 00:00:52.600

textview as a property declared up at



20

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.100

the start of the class so that it will



21

00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:56.350

be available throughout the class we're



22

00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:57.850

going to see why soon and that will also



23

00:00:57.850 --> 00:00:59.019

explain why you might want to have



24

00:00:59.019 --> 00:01:02.469

widget references as properties so it's



25

00:01:02.469 --> 00:01:04.540

worth actually running the program again



26

00:01:04.540 --> 00:01:05.770

just to make sure that we haven't broken



27

00:01:05.770 --> 00:01:09.850

anything so let's quickly do that I'm



28

00:01:09.850 --> 00:01:10.660

just going to click on the button



29

00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:12.010

without changing the name you can see



30

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:14.230

that's still being appended so that's



31

00:01:14.230 --> 00:01:17.200

all working fall install now there's one



32

00:01:17.200 --> 00:01:19.150

more change of want to make when the



33

00:01:19.150 --> 00:01:19.960

button is clicked



34

00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.150

you have to backspace it to remove the



35

00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:23.650

text in the other text so just going



36

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:24.910

back and having a look this we wanted to



37

00:01:24.910 --> 00:01:26.830

change this at the moment we've got to



38

00:01:26.830 --> 00:01:29.050

go back and change it before we can



39

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:30.550

actually change the text to make it



40

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:33.190

something different so what we should



41

00:01:33.190 --> 00:01:34.750

really be doing is clearing the contents



42

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.610

of the edit text when the button is



43

00:01:36.610 --> 00:01:39.910

clicked now an edit text widgets text



44

00:01:39.910 --> 00:01:42.520

property isn't a string it's an editable



45

00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:44.260

and we saw that in the previous video



46

00:01:44.260 --> 00:01:47.200

when using the ctrl key or command on a



47

00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:49.180

Mac and hovering over the user inputs



48

00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.220

text property so that means that this



49

00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.920

isn't quite as easy as it may appear but



50

00:01:53.920 --> 00:01:56.920

ultimately what we need to do is to set



51

00:01:56.920 --> 00:01:59.140

out edit text widgets text property to



52

00:01:59.140 --> 00:02:01.440

an empty string when the buttons tapped



53

00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:03.550

now if we go back and look at the code



54

00:02:03.550 --> 00:02:06.550

we were able to set the textview widgets



55

00:02:06.550 --> 00:02:08.860

text property on line 21



56

00:02:08.860 --> 00:02:11.230

you can see that here so you just text



57

00:02:11.230 --> 00:02:13.540

and set that equal to two double quotes



58

00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.640

which is an empty string we were able to



59

00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.170

do that directly because a string can be



60

00:02:17.170 --> 00:02:18.520

assigned to a textview



61

00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:21.040

which its text property however the same



62

00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:23.650

can't be done with an edit text widget



63

00:02:23.650 --> 00:02:26.470

so how do we go about solving this well



64

00:02:26.470 --> 00:02:28.060

there's actually two ways to do this and



65

00:02:28.060 --> 00:02:30.310

the change actually goes in the on click



66

00:02:30.310 --> 00:02:31.660

function as that's the code that



67

00:02:31.660 --> 00:02:33.670

executes when the user taps the button



68

00:02:33.670 --> 00:02:36.100

so we're going to come down here after



69

00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:38.590

doing the append and we can type user



70

00:02:38.590 --> 00:02:46.380

input dot text thought clear parentheses



71

00:02:46.380 --> 00:02:48.460

so you can see there that I'm using the



72

00:02:48.460 --> 00:02:51.040

clear function of the editable to clear



73

00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:54.280

its contents now we can also use the set



74

00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:56.560

text method instead of letting Kotlin



75

00:02:56.560 --> 00:02:59.440

access the text property directly so we



76

00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.790

can come back here and step and comment



77

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:04.690

that line out and I can instead do it



78

00:03:04.690 --> 00:03:09.790

user import dot set text parentheses and



79

00:03:09.790 --> 00:03:12.010

then two double quotes which is an empty



80

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:16.000

string now if I use the ctrl command key



81

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.440

depending on your operating system to



82

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.170

hover over set text you can see that it



83

00:03:20.170 --> 00:03:23.170

takes a char sequence type there so the



84

00:03:23.170 --> 00:03:24.910

string type is compatible with char



85

00:03:24.910 --> 00:03:27.400

sequence so therefore a set text works



86

00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.370

as we'd expected to now there's very



87

00:03:30.370 --> 00:03:32.709

little work to choose between these two



88

00:03:32.709 --> 00:03:34.720

approaches and so you can experiment by



89

00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:36.910

commenting out each one in turn when you



90

00:03:36.910 --> 00:03:38.590

run the app you'll see that they both



91

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:40.959

produce the behavior we want just to



92

00:03:40.959 --> 00:03:42.130

confirm that I'm just going to run it



93

00:03:42.130 --> 00:03:44.110

for for this one with the using the dot



94

00:03:44.110 --> 00:03:52.810

set text I press the button noting that



95

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:54.130

the button is cleared now and I can type



96

00:03:54.130 --> 00:03:56.740

Tim mr. button



97

00:03:56.740 --> 00:03:58.240

that's clearing each time as you can see



98

00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:02.080

all right Tom pre mini-challenge so your



99

00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.630

challenge is that when the app starts



100

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:06.070

the user input field starts off



101

00:04:06.070 --> 00:04:09.040

containing the text name so the user has



102

00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:10.780

to backspace as you saw me do to delete



103

00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:12.850

that before typing in the text they



104

00:04:12.850 --> 00:04:15.370

really want so this many challenge is to



105

00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:17.680

get you to figure out how to remove that



106

00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:19.840

default from the user input widget when



107

00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:22.870

the app first starts so go ahead and see



108

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:23.800

if you can figure that out



109

00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.540

pause the video and come back when



110

00:04:25.540 --> 00:04:28.980

you're ready to see the solution



111

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.930

all right well there's several ways to



112

00:04:30.930 --> 00:04:33.060

do this when programming so the test



113

00:04:33.060 --> 00:04:35.130

here again is doesn't work and not that



114

00:04:35.130 --> 00:04:36.660

you've got exactly the same code as I'm



115

00:04:36.660 --> 00:04:38.640

about to show you so you could for



116

00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:40.290

example have changed the layout so



117

00:04:40.290 --> 00:04:42.210

there's no text in the Edit text widget



118

00:04:42.210 --> 00:04:44.220

that's a good solution and later in the



119

00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:46.350

course I'll be showing your way to still



120

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:48.060

have text in a widget without it



121

00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:50.370

appearing when the app runs for my



122

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:51.690

solution though I'm going to clear the



123

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:54.690

text from user import in the oncreate



124

00:04:54.690 --> 00:04:57.180

method and you can also have use the



125

00:04:57.180 --> 00:05:00.840

clear method as we've saw earlier so I'm



126

00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:04.140

going to come up here we've got the line



127

00:05:04.140 --> 00:05:06.510

here textview movement method equals



128

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:09.300

scroll moving method after that I'm



129

00:05:09.300 --> 00:05:11.820

going to call user imports top in I



130

00:05:11.820 --> 00:05:17.250

should say user import dot set text and



131

00:05:17.250 --> 00:05:19.140

double quotes in there that's going to



132

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:23.040

be executed after that's been set up now



133

00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:25.260

in the next video I'm going to start by



134

00:05:25.260 --> 00:05:27.330

discussing the activity lifecycle and



135

00:05:27.330 --> 00:05:29.010

show you what we're not with our inner



136

00:05:29.010 --> 00:05:31.800

text when the device was rotated so



137

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:38.310

let's actually try this out and we can



138

00:05:38.310 --> 00:05:39.690

see now that we've started out with no



139

00:05:39.690 --> 00:05:42.300

text in the inner text which is correct



140

00:05:42.300 --> 00:05:44.670

and I can type in something I'm still



141

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:47.430

being cleared each time so that's



142

00:05:47.430 --> 00:05:49.520

working



143

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.380

alright so in the next video what I'm



144

00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:53.060

going to do is discuss the activity



145

00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.490

lifecycle and show you what actually



146

00:05:55.490 --> 00:05:57.080

went on without enter text when the



147

00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.270

device was rotated which you saw a few



148

00:05:59.270 --> 00:06:01.910

videos ago now by the way you might find



149

00:06:01.910 --> 00:06:03.410

I talked about methods rather than



150

00:06:03.410 --> 00:06:05.240

functions in some of the videos coming



151

00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.210

up as Scotland programmers we're used to



152

00:06:08.210 --> 00:06:10.580

talking about functions named in Java



153

00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:13.099

they're called methods but don't worry



154

00:06:13.099 --> 00:06:14.330

about the different names they're



155

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.430

basically the same thing because the



156

00:06:16.430 --> 00:06:18.169

lifecycle functions in the android



157

00:06:18.169 --> 00:06:20.650

framework are currently written in java



158

00:06:20.650 --> 00:06:23.509

technically they are methods rather than



159

00:06:23.509 --> 00:06:25.639

functions so I generally will use the



160

00:06:25.639 --> 00:06:27.259

word method when talking about framework



161

00:06:27.259 --> 00:06:29.539

functions and sometimes I may get



162

00:06:29.539 --> 00:06:30.889

confused and say method well I should



163

00:06:30.889 --> 00:06:32.900

say function and I think I've already



164

00:06:32.900 --> 00:06:34.639

done that a few times in this course it



165

00:06:34.639 --> 00:06:36.949

will vice-versa but hopefully I won't do



166

00:06:36.949 --> 00:06:38.360

any more but if I do just keep in mind



167

00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:39.800

that they're really the same thing here



168

00:06:39.800 --> 00:06:41.720

all right so what I'm going to do is end



169

00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:43.639

by reformatting the code so I'm going to



170

00:06:43.639 --> 00:06:48.979

go ahead and do that code reformat all



171

00:06:48.979 --> 00:06:52.659

right so I'll see you in the next video
