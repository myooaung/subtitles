1
00:00:04,740 --> 00:00:09,120
in the previous video we added some

2
00:00:06,990 --> 00:00:10,559
debug logging to our app now in this

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,840
video we're gonna have a look at what it

4
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,059
does and how it can be useful now at the

5
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:16,470
bottom of the Android studio screen or a

6
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:18,660
couple of panes that can be really

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:21,540
useful when you get around to running

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:24,960
your apps now the first one down here is

9
00:00:21,540 --> 00:00:28,259
the run window so run the what I'm going

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,390
to do is run the app now just confirm

11
00:00:28,259 --> 00:00:32,730
that we can see that running let's see

12
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,100
that running now they're going to click

13
00:00:32,730 --> 00:00:38,070
on the run tab over here to actually see

14
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,050
some information about it and it starts

15
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:42,660
off showing the adb commands that

16
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:44,760
Android studio uses to install and run

17
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,890
the device now we're going to be looking

18
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:49,109
at adb which is the Android debug bridge

19
00:00:46,890 --> 00:00:50,730
a lot later in the course

20
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:53,339
but if you get problems running your

21
00:00:50,730 --> 00:00:55,410
apps then we may ask you to have a look

22
00:00:53,339 --> 00:00:57,149
in here and paste any error messages

23
00:00:55,410 --> 00:00:59,219
into the discussion and Q&A area

24
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:01,739
now hopefully Android studio will

25
00:00:59,219 --> 00:01:03,690
connect your emulator or device if

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,090
you've got a slow system with less than

27
00:01:03,690 --> 00:01:08,640
say 8 gigabytes of RAM then it's a good

28
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:10,560
idea to start your emulator manually and

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,630
you can see that in videos that I've

30
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,040
been doing in some cases I've been

31
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:16,590
running the emulator having the emulator

32
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,570
already running and by the way you can

33
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:21,420
do that from the AVD manager that we saw

34
00:01:18,570 --> 00:01:22,829
in section 3 now starting the emulator

35
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:24,869
before you start coding we'll give it

36
00:01:22,829 --> 00:01:27,390
time to start up and saves you having to

37
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:30,780
wait when you run your app ok so that's

38
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:33,659
the run tap the second tab is used for

39
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:37,049
once your app actually runs and I'm

40
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:38,759
ignoring the to do at this stage and it

41
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,219
used to be called the Android monitor

42
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,200
pane but in Android studio 3 is now been

43
00:01:41,219 --> 00:01:45,270
renamed to logcat and this is one here

44
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:46,799
and possibly they renamed it because

45
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,500
that's what most people called it anyway

46
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,259
now the lock kansai click that that

47
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:54,329
shows all sorts of things that are

48
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,460
happening on any connected device or

49
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,289
emulator and with a real device you'd

50
00:01:56,460 --> 00:02:00,479
see loads of entries appearing in him

51
00:01:58,289 --> 00:02:02,280
and you probably also see some warnings

52
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,869
and probably some errors as well and

53
00:02:02,280 --> 00:02:06,030
most of these will have nothing to do

54
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:07,920
with your app so the trick here is to

55
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:09,750
work out what's what because there can

56
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,270
be a lot of output in here but

57
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:15,840
fortunately we can filter that now over

58
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:17,670
to the far right here is a drop down and

59
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:18,450
at the moment you can see that it's been

60
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:20,760
set to show

61
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:22,020
any selected application now you might

62
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:24,540
think that that's enough and we don't

63
00:02:22,020 --> 00:02:26,700
need to provide a filter as well but it

64
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:28,709
also shows all sorts of system events

65
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,840
now if we want a full picture of what's

66
00:02:28,709 --> 00:02:33,349
being locked we can change this drop

67
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,700
down to no filters sub done there now

68
00:02:33,349 --> 00:02:37,380
now we get a ton about put aside scroll

69
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:41,519
up you can see there's a lot lot of

70
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:42,840
information there and that's with the

71
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,819
emulator just sitting there not really

72
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,010
doing much and all of that might be

73
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:48,569
useful to Google engineers but I think

74
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:50,370
at this point it's fairly confusing to

75
00:02:48,569 --> 00:02:51,660
us so what I'm going to do is put that

76
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:53,549
back to show only the selected

77
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:56,280
application again show any selected

78
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,239
application now if you're debugging more

79
00:02:56,280 --> 00:02:59,370
than one app at once

80
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,170
maybe you've created a GUI app and a

81
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:02,700
service for example then you select

82
00:03:01,170 --> 00:03:06,450
which one to display in the second

83
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,900
drop-down over here so the second from

84
00:03:06,450 --> 00:03:08,819
the left

85
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:10,110
and you could choose which particular

86
00:03:08,819 --> 00:03:13,319
app that you're wanting to get the

87
00:03:10,110 --> 00:03:15,750
output for you can see that there's

88
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:17,819
quite a few what Android apps that are

89
00:03:15,750 --> 00:03:19,470
actually running right now on this

90
00:03:17,819 --> 00:03:22,560
emulator but you can see that's ours

91
00:03:19,470 --> 00:03:24,030
they obviously by the name alright so

92
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:26,910
I'm going to leave that on but encounter

93
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:28,200
apps tool which is our app and we can

94
00:03:26,910 --> 00:03:30,269
look at what happened when we launch the

95
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:33,690
app now if we scroll back to the top of

96
00:03:30,269 --> 00:03:35,430
the entries and if you scroll I don't

97
00:03:33,690 --> 00:03:38,989
have a look we should be able to see the

98
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:42,150
oncreate method message that we actually

99
00:03:38,989 --> 00:03:45,720
put into our code and there's the own

100
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:47,280
create called message so that's the text

101
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,049
we used in the log d call or at least

102
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,510
the last part is the uncreate called

103
00:03:49,049 --> 00:03:54,540
the rest has been added automatically by

104
00:03:51,510 --> 00:03:55,739
Android to the left-hand side alright so

105
00:03:54,540 --> 00:03:56,760
there's still a lot of other stuff there

106
00:03:55,739 --> 00:03:58,470
you can see here that we're not really

107
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:00,720
interested in at this stage so we can

108
00:03:58,470 --> 00:04:02,760
tidy up this log a little bit more so

109
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,400
there's a search box towards the

110
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:08,310
right-hand side over here so what we can

111
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:10,410
do is we can further filter what's being

112
00:04:08,310 --> 00:04:12,239
displayed and that's one of the reasons

113
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:14,609
for providing the tag that we did in the

114
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:16,139
previous video in our login call our tag

115
00:04:14,609 --> 00:04:20,810
was main activity so I'm going to type

116
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:23,099
main activity into the Box main activity

117
00:04:20,810 --> 00:04:26,820
and you can see that toe we've got one

118
00:04:23,099 --> 00:04:28,560
create corner which was the message now

119
00:04:26,820 --> 00:04:30,630
I suggest always typing in lowercase

120
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,780
here by all means experiment but

121
00:04:30,630 --> 00:04:33,940
generally you'll get

122
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:35,800
better results with lower case basically

123
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:37,570
lower case will always work but if you

124
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:39,520
try to match the case of the tag and

125
00:04:37,570 --> 00:04:42,190
make a mistake and it doesn't work so

126
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,200
I'm going to quickly demonstrate that by

127
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:47,130
deleting the contents of the box and

128
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:49,450
typing main this time with a capital M

129
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:51,460
and that's obviously working fine but if

130
00:04:49,450 --> 00:04:54,040
I then start to add activity but using a

131
00:04:51,460 --> 00:04:56,830
lowercase a I see you can see that the

132
00:04:54,040 --> 00:04:58,270
log out port has disappeared in other

133
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:00,130
words nothing matches so all the log

134
00:04:58,270 --> 00:05:01,840
entry is disappear and once again

135
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:03,580
experiment after you watch this in the

136
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:05,500
next video alright so I'm going to put

137
00:05:03,580 --> 00:05:08,560
that main activity back in lower case

138
00:05:05,500 --> 00:05:11,110
again and we only get the log entry

139
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:12,100
entries from our main activity class you

140
00:05:11,110 --> 00:05:15,040
know at the moment there's only one

141
00:05:12,100 --> 00:05:17,020
entry on create court and we'll be

142
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:18,130
adding some more but at the moment I

143
00:05:17,020 --> 00:05:20,200
just want to get you familiar with

144
00:05:18,130 --> 00:05:21,910
filtering the logcat now if you recall

145
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,740
we also added login to the buttons

146
00:05:21,910 --> 00:05:27,550
onclicklistener so i'm going to switch

147
00:05:23,740 --> 00:05:32,860
over to the emulator now type in some

148
00:05:27,550 --> 00:05:35,910
text click on the button and you can see

149
00:05:32,860 --> 00:05:38,080
what happe r in the log captor pane

150
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:39,340
basically every time the buttons tapped

151
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,110
we're going to get that second message

152
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,330
if you just go back and just click it a

153
00:05:41,110 --> 00:05:45,460
few more times

154
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:47,979
you can see it's being outputted into

155
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,919
the vodka pain every time that button is

156
00:05:47,979 --> 00:05:53,260
actually tapped so that's pretty cool

157
00:05:50,919 --> 00:05:55,229
and it's a very useful way to see when

158
00:05:53,260 --> 00:05:57,280
you miss it when your methods get called

159
00:05:55,229 --> 00:05:58,930
now I've been telling you that the

160
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,020
activity will be destroyed and recreated

161
00:05:58,930 --> 00:06:03,729
when the device is rotated if that's the

162
00:06:02,020 --> 00:06:06,280
case we should see uncreate being called

163
00:06:03,729 --> 00:06:07,810
again when we switch to landscape now

164
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,580
before I do that there's something else

165
00:06:07,810 --> 00:06:11,800
I want to show you and it's not obvious

166
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:14,080
since also not documented at least as

167
00:06:11,800 --> 00:06:15,640
far as we've been able to find now we

168
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:17,710
can quickly end up with a lot of log

169
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,380
entries even with the filters that we've

170
00:06:17,710 --> 00:06:22,600
set up and that can make working out

171
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:24,340
what's just happened quite difficult now

172
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,380
fortunately we can break up these log

173
00:06:24,340 --> 00:06:29,110
entries a bit what we're about to do is

174
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:31,000
rotate the device into landscape so we

175
00:06:29,110 --> 00:06:33,789
can add a comment to that effect in the

176
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,500
log cap now if we move further I'll

177
00:06:33,789 --> 00:06:38,860
click the mouse after the last entry in

178
00:06:35,500 --> 00:06:40,150
the log cat we actually get a line break

179
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,460
as you can see there the cursor moved

180
00:06:40,150 --> 00:06:47,310
out and if we type in that something

181
00:06:42,460 --> 00:06:47,310
here's our rotating intern landscape

182
00:06:47,760 --> 00:06:53,080
press ENTER again and now we're going to

183
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:57,180
go back and rotate the device into

184
00:06:53,080 --> 00:06:57,180
landscape and if I do that

185
00:06:58,790 --> 00:07:03,870
you can see what's happened that

186
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:06,210
obviously the device has been rotated

187
00:07:03,870 --> 00:07:08,460
into landscape mode and that's expected

188
00:07:06,210 --> 00:07:10,140
we can see the uncreate being caught

189
00:07:08,460 --> 00:07:12,270
again and now that we've actually topped

190
00:07:10,140 --> 00:07:13,710
in that message it's very easy to see

191
00:07:12,270 --> 00:07:15,750
which methods were called after we did

192
00:07:13,710 --> 00:07:18,030
that so if we then had come back here

193
00:07:15,750 --> 00:07:23,730
and then add another message back to

194
00:07:18,030 --> 00:07:27,150
portrait then go back to the device your

195
00:07:23,730 --> 00:07:29,960
emulator then go back to portrait we can

196
00:07:27,150 --> 00:07:33,480
see that our log cat is telling us that

197
00:07:29,960 --> 00:07:36,570
oncreate scored again and also now the

198
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:39,270
layout of the log is probably a lot more

199
00:07:36,570 --> 00:07:41,730
intuitive now this is going to be far

200
00:07:39,270 --> 00:07:43,680
more informative when we log the rest of

201
00:07:41,730 --> 00:07:45,180
the lifecycle methods but already you

202
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,190
can see there's a great way to see

203
00:07:45,180 --> 00:07:48,900
what's going on with our apps and which

204
00:07:47,190 --> 00:07:51,480
of our methods the android framework is

205
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:52,950
calling now I said that this ability to

206
00:07:51,480 --> 00:07:54,900
type comments into the lock head is

207
00:07:52,950 --> 00:07:57,240
undocumented it's been working for the

208
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,800
last few releases of Android studio but

209
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:01,260
that doesn't mean it's kind of going to

210
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:03,690
continue to work and the reason for that

211
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:06,030
is Google changes things all the time so

212
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:08,340
make use of it while long while as long

213
00:08:06,030 --> 00:08:09,690
as it lasts or as long as it lasts and

214
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:11,640
if you find that you can no longer type

215
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,380
into the logcat you just have to accept

216
00:08:11,640 --> 00:08:15,900
that the facilities been removed for

217
00:08:13,380 --> 00:08:17,940
whatever reason now the last time I

218
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,830
mentioned in an undocumented feature in

219
00:08:17,940 --> 00:08:21,690
a video Google removed it two weeks

220
00:08:19,830 --> 00:08:23,040
later so I'm just one so that's why I'm

221
00:08:21,690 --> 00:08:25,230
telling you now that it might stop

222
00:08:23,040 --> 00:08:26,640
working all right so that's the logcat

223
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,760
and how to use it

224
00:08:26,640 --> 00:08:32,880
now I haven't mentioned this first

225
00:08:28,760 --> 00:08:35,070
drop-down box and if you've got several

226
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,630
emulators of devices connected and lets

227
00:08:35,070 --> 00:08:38,610
you select which one you want to view

228
00:08:36,630 --> 00:08:40,320
the logs for keep an eye on that because

229
00:08:38,610 --> 00:08:42,150
if you closed down the emulator and

230
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,370
restart it you might end up with one

231
00:08:42,150 --> 00:08:46,650
marked as dead now obviously it won't

232
00:08:44,370 --> 00:08:48,510
log anything if it's not running so use

233
00:08:46,650 --> 00:08:51,600
that drop box if that's the case to

234
00:08:48,510 --> 00:08:53,520
choose the one that is running all right

235
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,840
I'm gonna stop the video here in the

236
00:08:53,520 --> 00:08:57,060
next video we'll add looking to the

237
00:08:54,840 --> 00:08:58,800
other life cycle methods and see exactly

238
00:08:57,060 --> 00:09:00,480
what happens to our app while it's

239
00:08:58,800 --> 00:09:02,720
running so I'll see you in the next

240
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,720
video
