00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.550

In this video we're going to go ahead



2

00:00:06.550 --> 00:00:08.139

and download and install the Java



3

00:00:08.139 --> 00:00:10.480

development kit also known as the JDK



4

00:00:10.480 --> 00:00:12.360

we're going to install it on Linux



5

00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:14.469

specifically we're going to install it



6

00:00:14.469 --> 00:00:18.039

on ubuntu 16.04, so if you're running a



7

00:00:18.039 --> 00:00:20.020

different version of Linux you should be



8

00:00:20.020 --> 00:00:21.370

able to follow along and do something



9

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:24.400

similar for your distro and also keep in



10

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:25.330

mind if you're running on a Windows



11

00:00:25.330 --> 00:00:28.360

machine or a Mac computer we've actually



12

00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:30.940

got separate videos for your operating



13

00:00:30.940 --> 00:00:32.770

systems because the process is slightly



14

00:00:32.770 --> 00:00:34.870

different but if you run the Linux machine



15

00:00:34.870 --> 00:00:36.699

follow along because you at the right



16

00:00:36.699 --> 00:00:38.890

place. Alright so the first thing we want



17

00:00:38.890 --> 00:00:41.140

to do is open up a command window so I'm



18

00:00:41.140 --> 00:00:46.059

just going to open a terminal, let me



19

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:47.170

secure in to bring that in and just



20

00:00:47.170 --> 00:00:49.359

enlarge it a little bit and what we'll



21

00:00:49.359 --> 00:00:53.019

do first is we'll the sudo space apt -



22

00:00:53.019 --> 00:00:56.170

get space update just want update the



23

00:00:56.170 --> 00:01:00.850

package index type in your password give



24

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:04.360

that a moment to complete, you can see



25

00:01:04.360 --> 00:01:05.470

that was pretty quick so next thing



26

00:01:05.470 --> 00:01:07.229

we're going to do now is type sudo space



27

00:01:07.229 --> 00:01:16.320

add - apt - repository space PPA : web



28

00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:23.440

upd 8team forward slash java give



29

00:01:23.440 --> 00:01:27.240

that a moment to complete press enter



30

00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:30.490

once that's finished we do a sudo space



31

00:01:30.490 --> 00:01:36.950

apt - get space update



32

00:01:36.950 --> 00:01:38.630

once that's finished, we're going to do



33

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:44.530

sudo space apt - get space install space



34

00:01:44.530 --> 00:01:47.869

Oracle space Java 8



35

00:01:47.869 --> 00:01:52.760

- installer and I'll go to press yes



36

00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.580

there select yes and press enter or



37

00:01:55.580 --> 00:01:57.970

select why I should say type it anyway



38

00:01:57.970 --> 00:01:59.630

then we're going to go through this



39

00:01:59.630 --> 00:02:01.190

little configuration guide, so I'm going



40

00:02:01.190 --> 00:02:04.310

to press enter and do we accept the



41

00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:06.740

Oracle binary code license terms yes to



42

00:02:06.740 --> 00:02:10.399

that I'm going to press enter and you



43

00:02:10.399 --> 00:02:11.390

can see that's they're going away



44

00:02:11.390 --> 00:02:15.290

downloading the JDK, so give that a



45

00:02:15.290 --> 00:02:16.519

moment to complete I'm just going to



46

00:02:16.519 --> 00:02:18.140

fast forward this video to the end of



47

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:21.349

the download.



48

00:02:21.349 --> 00:02:23.579

Okay the downloads complete you can see



49

00:02:23.579 --> 00:02:26.299

it's just finishing the configuration



50

00:02:26.299 --> 00:02:29.159

and that's now complete and what we'll



51

00:02:29.159 --> 00:02:33.230

do now is we'll type in sudo space update



52

00:02:33.230 --> 00:02:39.090

- alternatives, two minus signs, two dashes in



53

00:02:39.090 --> 00:02:42.840

other words config space Java and you



54

00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:44.909

can see that there's an option there we



55

00:02:44.909 --> 00:02:46.709

could select either of those but the



56

00:02:46.709 --> 00:02:48.689

correct option is showing for me you can



57

00:02:48.689 --> 00:02:51.359

see that it shows Java 8 Oracle so



58

00:02:51.359 --> 00:02:53.250

depending on your installation of Linux



59

00:02:53.250 --> 00:02:55.220

you might have other versions of the



60

00:02:55.220 --> 00:02:58.709

Java perhaps open JDK or a different



61

00:02:58.709 --> 00:03:00.810

version of Java, so you could select the



62

00:03:00.810 --> 00:03:02.340

relevant option but in this case the



63

00:03:02.340 --> 00:03:04.409

default option is correct and we're good



64

00:03:04.409 --> 00:03:06.420

to go so I'm just going to press enter



65

00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:09.209

there to not do anything and the last



66

00:03:09.209 --> 00:03:12.389

thing to do is just type in Java space -v



67

00:03:12.389 --> 00:03:18.810

try -- version, lucky



68

00:03:18.810 --> 00:03:21.900

Java space - version that's what I



69

00:03:21.900 --> 00:03:23.489

was trying to do the first time and that



70

00:03:23.489 --> 00:03:25.500

now confirms that we've successfully



71

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.319

installed Java and you can see that it



72

00:03:28.319 --> 00:03:29.699

shows that we're running in this



73

00:03:29.699 --> 00:03:33.209

particular case build 25.144 or



74

00:03:33.209 --> 00:03:34.590

you can see on the previous line up here



75

00:03:34.590 --> 00:03:38.669

build one point 8.0 underscore 144 so



76

00:03:38.669 --> 00:03:40.169

this number here may be different for



77

00:03:40.169 --> 00:03:43.109

you, 144 indicates the build release of



78

00:03:43.109 --> 00:03:45.599

in this case Jade the Java development



79

00:03:45.599 --> 00:03:48.540

kit version 8 but the point is that we



80

00:03:48.540 --> 00:03:49.199

good to go.



81

00:03:49.199 --> 00:03:51.239

So that's now downloaded and installed



82

00:03:51.239 --> 00:03:53.010

correctly and what we can do we've



83

00:03:53.010 --> 00:03:54.449

checked that java is on there we can type



84

00:03:54.449 --> 00:03:57.229

in Java C which is the Java compiler



85

00:03:57.229 --> 00:03:59.430

just to confirm that that actually



86

00:03:59.430 --> 00:04:00.569

worked and that's part of the Java



87

00:04:00.569 --> 00:04:02.519

development kit and you can see that



88

00:04:02.519 --> 00:04:03.750

that's come up as well and if we wanted



89

00:04:03.750 --> 00:04:05.849

to we could do the same thing with the



90

00:04:05.849 --> 00:04:10.560

version Java C one point eight point



91

00:04:10.560 --> 00:04:12.090

zero underscore one four four so in



92

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:13.409

in other words, we've got our Java



93

00:04:13.409 --> 00:04:15.449

development kit installed and we can



94

00:04:15.449 --> 00:04:19.340

proceed now and move on to the next video.
