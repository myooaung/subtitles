1
00:00:04,750 --> 00:00:07,389
at the end of the previous video I left

2
00:00:07,389 --> 00:00:10,059
you with a challenge to add a new button

3
00:00:10,059 --> 00:00:12,400
to the calculator to allow negative

4
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,920
numbers to be used in calculations no

5
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:16,689
I'm not going to show you the slide

6
00:00:16,689 --> 00:00:18,010
again because you can refer to the end

7
00:00:18,010 --> 00:00:20,140
of the last video but essentially the

8
00:00:20,140 --> 00:00:22,150
thing missing from the calculator app is

9
00:00:22,150 --> 00:00:24,070
the ability to enter to enter negative

10
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:26,859
numbers for calculations and we talked

11
00:00:26,859 --> 00:00:29,140
about adding a button to negate the

12
00:00:29,140 --> 00:00:32,290
current value of what is actually in the

13
00:00:32,290 --> 00:00:35,680
edit text so for the solution I'm going

14
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,170
to work in the landscape layout because

15
00:00:38,170 --> 00:00:39,880
it's got a bit more room horizontally

16
00:00:39,880 --> 00:00:42,640
and will look better in the video now

17
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,920
adding the button itself is easy but it

18
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:46,840
does mess up the centering of the button

19
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:49,000
array that's because there are now five

20
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:51,490
or will be five buttons across so the

21
00:00:51,490 --> 00:00:53,050
guideline would run through the middle

22
00:00:53,050 --> 00:00:56,110
of the button but nine now I could add

23
00:00:56,110 --> 00:00:57,910
the new button by dragging one onto the

24
00:00:57,910 --> 00:00:59,590
blueprint which would work falling and

25
00:00:59,590 --> 00:01:01,750
we've seen a few attributes of these

26
00:01:01,750 --> 00:01:04,269
tops though so it would be handy if we

27
00:01:04,269 --> 00:01:05,860
could somehow create a new button with

28
00:01:05,860 --> 00:01:08,980
all the same attributes already set so

29
00:01:08,980 --> 00:01:11,470
it turns out we can actually do that so

30
00:01:11,470 --> 00:01:13,290
if we right click one of these buttons

31
00:01:13,290 --> 00:01:16,060
I'm going to use button divided here so

32
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:18,940
right-click it and choose copy from the

33
00:01:18,940 --> 00:01:23,140
menu next we're going to come over here

34
00:01:23,140 --> 00:01:24,850
and right click on the layout and choose

35
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:27,780
paste

36
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:30,190
you know I consistently had problems

37
00:01:30,190 --> 00:01:32,260
doing that in Windows if they're doesn't

38
00:01:32,260 --> 00:01:34,720
the button doesn't paste right click on

39
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,180
the constraint layout in the componentry

40
00:01:37,180 --> 00:01:38,920
and paste there because that worked

41
00:01:38,920 --> 00:01:40,630
every time but if I opened the

42
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:44,710
componentry all the componentry is open

43
00:01:44,710 --> 00:01:46,240
i'll just open the palette so that we

44
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:48,460
can see down the bottom here we have got

45
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:49,990
button divided to here so it did

46
00:01:49,990 --> 00:01:52,119
actually copy but because we've copied

47
00:01:52,119 --> 00:01:55,150
the button all the details relating to

48
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,400
that button have been copied as well so

49
00:01:57,400 --> 00:01:58,780
in other words nothing seemed to happen

50
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:00,880
but that's because the new button was

51
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,890
pasted on top of the one that we copied

52
00:02:02,890 --> 00:02:04,930
now we can drag it out of the way to

53
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:07,299
make it visible and I like to select it

54
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:08,709
in the componentry first just to make

55
00:02:08,709 --> 00:02:10,090
sure you've got the right one but I want

56
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:12,060
to do that

57
00:02:12,060 --> 00:02:14,290
so first thing I'm going to do first is

58
00:02:14,290 --> 00:02:16,209
now come over here I'm going to delete

59
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:18,310
all the constraints using the delete

60
00:02:18,310 --> 00:02:20,050
straights button for this particular

61
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,130
button they're gonna set its ID to

62
00:02:24,130 --> 00:02:25,870
button neg at the moment it's done it's

63
00:02:25,870 --> 00:02:32,489
called button divided to sew button nig

64
00:02:32,489 --> 00:02:34,900
I'm also going to change the text size

65
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,870
property to 12s pages so it better

66
00:02:37,870 --> 00:02:39,489
matches the size of the other button so

67
00:02:39,489 --> 00:02:43,810
text size over here 12 SP and we're

68
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:45,730
going to change the actual text itself

69
00:02:45,730 --> 00:02:47,019
instead of the slash it's going to be

70
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:53,160
negative sides because we've got

71
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:55,180
multiple letters here changing it to a

72
00:02:55,180 --> 00:02:58,720
smaller size makes it just sort of blend

73
00:02:58,720 --> 00:02:59,950
in with the other buttons a little bit

74
00:02:59,950 --> 00:03:02,530
better in terms of text size so to make

75
00:03:02,530 --> 00:03:04,330
it part of the grid we're going to set

76
00:03:04,330 --> 00:03:06,250
its baseline constraint to the divide

77
00:03:06,250 --> 00:03:08,650
button then also constrain its left edge

78
00:03:08,650 --> 00:03:10,360
to the right edge of the divide button

79
00:03:10,360 --> 00:03:12,160
so I'm just going to move this out of

80
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:15,700
the way a little bit first so again

81
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,519
we're going to constrain the baseline

82
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:20,769
constraint to the divide button so I

83
00:03:20,769 --> 00:03:21,730
think I would do what we've done always

84
00:03:21,730 --> 00:03:23,970
for constraining things about baseline

85
00:03:23,970 --> 00:03:27,579
and did it under divide and then also

86
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:30,280
constrain the right of the neg button to

87
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:31,930
the sorry the left to the dig button to

88
00:03:31,930 --> 00:03:33,870
the right of the divide button like so

89
00:03:33,870 --> 00:03:37,450
now the buttons are 48 DP wide so we

90
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,340
could try to Center the grid by using a

91
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:42,400
margin of minus 24 DP for the left

92
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:45,130
constraint of button 9 but unfortunately

93
00:03:45,130 --> 00:03:46,810
that doesn't work and that's because

94
00:03:46,810 --> 00:03:49,209
negative margins aren't allowed for

95
00:03:49,209 --> 00:03:51,220
constraints so let's actually have a

96
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,380
look at another way to Center the grid

97
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,359
and it turns out it's actually quite

98
00:03:55,359 --> 00:03:57,670
easy because we've already got an array

99
00:03:57,670 --> 00:03:59,920
of widgets that are all constrained to

100
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,470
the central button 9 so instead of

101
00:04:02,470 --> 00:04:04,180
trying to center button 9 to the

102
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:06,579
guideline I'm just going to Center it in

103
00:04:06,579 --> 00:04:08,650
the layout but I'm not going to delete

104
00:04:08,650 --> 00:04:10,420
the guideline because it's so used to

105
00:04:10,420 --> 00:04:12,880
Center the to edit text widgets I'm just

106
00:04:12,880 --> 00:04:14,620
going to delete the left-hand constraint

107
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,010
from button 9 to the guideline though so

108
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:19,450
I'm gonna start by coming out to button

109
00:04:19,450 --> 00:04:21,729
9 delete the left-sided constraint which

110
00:04:21,729 --> 00:04:22,900
is currently constrained to the

111
00:04:22,900 --> 00:04:24,940
guideline and even though it's closed

112
00:04:24,940 --> 00:04:26,830
you can see when I hover over that the

113
00:04:26,830 --> 00:04:29,140
little lion is hovering and moving up

114
00:04:29,140 --> 00:04:31,570
he's showing in red linking up to the

115
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:31,960
god

116
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:33,490
telling me that the constraint is on the

117
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:36,569
guideline I'm going to delete that and

118
00:04:36,569 --> 00:04:38,800
to delete that you may have to move it

119
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,560
slightly over to the right just delete

120
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:43,599
it like so and then move it back again

121
00:04:43,599 --> 00:04:44,830
but actually we don't need to move it

122
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:46,199
back again because we're about to

123
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:48,720
constrain it again anyway to Center it

124
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:51,160
so I've deleted the left-hand constraint

125
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:53,500
from button 9 to the guideline and I'm

126
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,090
going to constrain the left edge of

127
00:04:55,090 --> 00:04:57,340
button 9 to the left edge of the layout

128
00:04:57,340 --> 00:04:59,860
and it's a right edge to the right edge

129
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:00,970
of the layout so let's go ahead and do

130
00:05:00,970 --> 00:05:02,979
that it's the left edge of button iron

131
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:07,570
to the left of the layout then the right

132
00:05:07,570 --> 00:05:10,180
edge of button 9 to the right edge of

133
00:05:10,180 --> 00:05:13,690
the layout and you saw that everything

134
00:05:13,690 --> 00:05:15,250
went a little bit weird when I set the

135
00:05:15,250 --> 00:05:17,349
left constraint the entire block jumped

136
00:05:17,349 --> 00:05:19,479
to the left and we seem to have lost

137
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:21,280
half the buttons but everything became

138
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:23,110
or came right when the right-hand

139
00:05:23,110 --> 00:05:24,759
constraint was set so it's actually fine

140
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:27,639
now as you can see and we can see that

141
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:30,669
the 963 and equal signs are perfectly in

142
00:05:30,669 --> 00:05:33,039
the middle of the layout so setting the

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,720
right-hand constraint first gives the

144
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:36,729
same behavior by the way the buttons to

145
00:05:36,729 --> 00:05:38,320
the right seem to disappear off to the

146
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:39,699
right edge of the screen in some cases

147
00:05:39,699 --> 00:05:41,560
but now that you've seen it and know

148
00:05:41,560 --> 00:05:43,990
that you needn't worry about it now that

149
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:45,699
may or may not happen for you you might

150
00:05:45,699 --> 00:05:47,590
find that some of your buttons do

151
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,270
disappear on the left or right hand edge

152
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:52,090
of the screen just depending on which

153
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:53,380
side of the constraints you're sitting

154
00:05:53,380 --> 00:05:55,419
first but if that does happen just

155
00:05:55,419 --> 00:05:57,190
continue by setting the other constraint

156
00:05:57,190 --> 00:05:59,500
on the other side of the widget and the

157
00:05:59,500 --> 00:06:00,820
things will come right as they are for

158
00:06:00,820 --> 00:06:03,159
me now all right so now that's caused

159
00:06:03,159 --> 00:06:05,919
the entire grid to be centered as long

160
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:08,400
as the horizontal slider is at 50% and

161
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,719
obviously we set that to that previously

162
00:06:10,719 --> 00:06:13,479
so these aren't 50% as you can't easily

163
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:15,610
see whether it's 50% by the way we'll

164
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:17,199
click it back so it's on the percentage

165
00:06:17,199 --> 00:06:18,969
that'll come back again now and you can

166
00:06:18,969 --> 00:06:20,469
see that we're sitting on that's 50% so

167
00:06:20,469 --> 00:06:23,440
that's good to go and again all the

168
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:24,789
other buttons follow what we did because

169
00:06:24,789 --> 00:06:27,310
they're constrained to button 9 the last

170
00:06:27,310 --> 00:06:29,409
thing I'm going to do here is now drag

171
00:06:29,409 --> 00:06:34,659
button neg just to be consistent to look

172
00:06:34,659 --> 00:06:37,930
at that to be below button divided it's

173
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:38,949
gonna come down here and just put that

174
00:06:38,949 --> 00:06:42,400
below button divide that's really where

175
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,620
it is in our layout all right so that's

176
00:06:44,620 --> 00:06:45,700
the layout

177
00:06:45,700 --> 00:06:47,470
I'm gonna reformat the coat before in

178
00:06:47,470 --> 00:06:50,080
the video often it won't need anything

179
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:51,670
changes but just to be consistent I'm

180
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:53,650
going to do that you can see no lines

181
00:06:53,650 --> 00:06:54,880
were needed to be changed there and go

182
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:58,480
back to the design tap so the XML is now

183
00:06:58,480 --> 00:07:00,760
nicely laid out and again the reason I'm

184
00:07:00,760 --> 00:07:02,800
doing that even though in most cases

185
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:04,720
Android studio is doing a good job of

186
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:07,450
keeping it reformatted is just in case

187
00:07:07,450 --> 00:07:08,980
you want to compare your code to mine

188
00:07:08,980 --> 00:07:10,900
alright so in the next lecture what

189
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,880
we're going to do is create the code to

190
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:14,830
make the neg button work see you in the

191
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:17,250
next video
