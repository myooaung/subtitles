00:00:04.560 --> 00:00:07.530

In the previous video we saw how to run



2

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:09.380

the app hello world app on an emulator.



3

00:00:09.380 --> 00:00:12.330

In this video I will connect a real



4

00:00:12.330 --> 00:00:15.540

Android device my own Android Nexus 5x



5

00:00:15.540 --> 00:00:18.900

phone and run our app on that. Now if



6

00:00:18.900 --> 00:00:20.610

you're using Windows it is important



7

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:23.250

that you installed a Google USB driver



8

00:00:23.250 --> 00:00:26.130

when we configured Android studio using



9

00:00:26.130 --> 00:00:27.300

the SDK manager



10

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:30.840

in the earlier video in section 2 and in



11

00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:32.489

addition depending on the model of phone



12

00:00:32.489 --> 00:00:34.410

you may need to install download and



13

00:00:34.410 --> 00:00:37.199

install a specific driver for your phone



14

00:00:37.199 --> 00:00:38.789

that's only if you're running on Windows



15

00:00:38.789 --> 00:00:41.309

now on a Mac or Linux machine however



16

00:00:41.309 --> 00:00:43.350

you can just plug the device in it it'll



17

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:45.239

works so that's a bit easy when I'm



18

00:00:45.239 --> 00:00:47.190

going to be doing this on my Mac. So I'm



19

00:00:47.190 --> 00:00:48.719

going to assume that in the case of



20

00:00:48.719 --> 00:00:50.219

Windows you've got the necessary drivers



21

00:00:50.219 --> 00:00:52.559

installed and you can connect your phone



22

00:00:52.559 --> 00:00:55.170

to your computer using a USB cable to



23

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:57.300

transfer files now if you have any



24

00:00:57.300 --> 00:00:59.460

problems doing that then you do need to



25

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:01.440

resolve them before continuing with this



26

00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.780

video Samsung phones on Windows for



27

00:01:03.780 --> 00:01:06.900

example need kies installed on



28

00:01:06.900 --> 00:01:08.880

Windows or certainly did at the time I'm



29

00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:10.530

recording this video, so do check if



30

00:01:10.530 --> 00:01:12.119

you're running on Windows if there's



31

00:01:12.119 --> 00:01:14.549

specific software drivers needed for



32

00:01:14.549 --> 00:01:16.350

your Android device to communicate with



33

00:01:16.350 --> 00:01:19.020

Windows. Alright so that said the first



34

00:01:19.020 --> 00:01:21.299

thing to check before using your phone



35

00:01:21.299 --> 00:01:23.280

to run your apps on is to make sure that



36

00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.259

you can transfer files from the phone or



37

00:01:25.259 --> 00:01:27.299

tablet and if you can't do that than



38

00:01:27.299 --> 00:01:28.950

anything else we try to do isn't going



39

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:31.649

to work now some phones come with USB



40

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:33.990

cables that are for charging only they



41

00:01:33.990 --> 00:01:35.939

don't allow data transfer and if you get



42

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:38.130

problems copying photos for example from



43

00:01:38.130 --> 00:01:40.170

your phone to your computer then do try



44

00:01:40.170 --> 00:01:42.329

a different cable we have seen problems



45

00:01:42.329 --> 00:01:44.219

in the past that can be resolved with a



46

00:01:44.219 --> 00:01:46.320

new cable so certainly if you're having



47

00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.259

issues do try using a separate cable now



48

00:01:49.259 --> 00:01:50.549

if you've got normal file transfer



49

00:01:50.549 --> 00:01:51.649

working though then let's get started



50

00:01:51.649 --> 00:01:55.380

running apps on a real device. Now I've



51

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:56.670

got some software that I'm about to



52

00:01:56.670 --> 00:01:58.530

start on my phone that lets me record



53

00:01:58.530 --> 00:02:00.869

the phone screen, so that I can show you



54

00:02:00.869 --> 00:02:02.490

what's happening on my phone as well as



55

00:02:02.490 --> 00:02:04.890

what's happening in Android studio so



56

00:02:04.890 --> 00:02:06.179

I'm going to switch over to the phone



57

00:02:06.179 --> 00:02:09.600

now start the recording and allow you to



58

00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:13.400

see what's actually going on on my phone.



59

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:15.780

Alright so now you can see that my



60

00:02:15.780 --> 00:02:18.300

screen my Nexus 5x screen is showing



61

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.610

and what we're going to do is enable the



62

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:22.620

developer options on this phone



63

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.170

now developer options aren't in any of



64

00:02:25.170 --> 00:02:27.210

the normal settings menus instead



65

00:02:27.210 --> 00:02:29.430

they're actually hidden until you enable



66

00:02:29.430 --> 00:02:32.820

them and in my case we go into settings



67

00:02:32.820 --> 00:02:35.100

to actually do that so I'm going to come



68

00:02:35.100 --> 00:02:39.750

down here go into my settings and this



69

00:02:39.750 --> 00:02:42.000

may be slightly different depending on



70

00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.260

the phone that you're running but in the



71

00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:45.960

case of the Google Nexus 5x I scroll



72

00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.640

down to the bottom. Okay, so I want



73

00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:49.710

someone this settings menu I'm going to



74

00:02:49.710 --> 00:02:52.050

click on system in my case so it'll be



75

00:02:52.050 --> 00:02:53.280

something along the lines of settings



76

00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.990

about phone you need to get to the menu



77

00:02:54.990 --> 00:02:57.750

that has the about phone option so I



78

00:02:57.750 --> 00:03:00.120

click on system in my case you can see



79

00:03:00.120 --> 00:03:01.410

down the bottom here I've got about



80

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:04.560

phone and what I can do there now is I



81

00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:07.440

could actually click on that and that



82

00:03:07.440 --> 00:03:09.390

brings us to this about phone option.



83

00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:10.740

Now just before I scroll down to the bottom



84

00:03:10.740 --> 00:03:12.960

and the his build number do note that



85

00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:14.700

this option he hasn't got a developer's



86

00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.470

menu option at the moment so what that



87

00:03:16.470 --> 00:03:18.150

means is it's not enabled so in the case



88

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:19.680

of my phone this is where that Pena will



89

00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.110

appear so I'll go into about phone and



90

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.570

you'll need to find that for your device



91

00:03:23.570 --> 00:03:25.620

so get down here scroll down to the



92

00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.030

bottom we've got this build number as



93

00:03:27.030 --> 00:03:29.760

you can see here, so what we need to do



94

00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.480

is actually tap that seven times when



95

00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.709

you do that you get a message that



96

00:03:34.709 --> 00:03:36.750

developer options have been enabled and



97

00:03:36.750 --> 00:03:38.160

it's not very intuitive but that's



98

00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:40.020

deliberate so it prevents people from



99

00:03:40.020 --> 00:03:42.120

turning developer options on without



100

00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.620

knowing what they are or what they're



101

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:46.080

for and in the case of using an Android



102

00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.240

device for testing we need to have that



103

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:49.980

developers option so I'm going to tap



104

00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:53.760

this build number seven times you'll



105

00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.200

notice that we've got a menu a little



106

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:57.630

toast message popping up there now and



107

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.610

I've only got up this machines message



108

00:03:59.610 --> 00:04:01.050

here and because I'm using a Google



109

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:03.300

Nexus 5x I've got a pattern that I can



110

00:04:03.300 --> 00:04:06.090

specify to unlock this phone but if



111

00:04:06.090 --> 00:04:07.590

you're you didn't have a pattern you



112

00:04:07.590 --> 00:04:09.209

might have a pin or some other mechanism



113

00:04:09.209 --> 00:04:10.920

to unlock the phone at this point so I'm



114

00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:15.290

just going to unlock this and continue



115

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:18.090

and now you can see that it says down



116

00:04:18.090 --> 00:04:20.340

the bottom you are now a developer so



117

00:04:20.340 --> 00:04:22.290

basically tapping the build number seven



118

00:04:22.290 --> 00:04:24.360

times turns on the developer options and



119

00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.710

lets you use the phone for development



120

00:04:25.710 --> 00:04:27.419

purposes, which we want to do in this



121

00:04:27.419 --> 00:04:29.940

course so you know should have a new



122

00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:32.160

menu on your phone it should either been this me



123

00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:35.400

you hear if we go back one you can see



124

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:36.780

now that we've got this menu developer



125

00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.460

options showing on the screen now which



126

00:04:38.460 --> 00:04:40.650

wasn't there before. So your first



127

00:04:40.650 --> 00:04:41.970

challenge in this course is if you're



128

00:04:41.970 --> 00:04:44.400

not running a Google Nexus 5x is to find



129

00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.350

that menu on your phone, so in my case



130

00:04:46.350 --> 00:04:47.700

you can see there so I'm going to click



131

00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:51.990

on developer options. Now there's a host



132

00:04:51.990 --> 00:04:53.910

of options and then developer options



133

00:04:53.910 --> 00:04:55.800

menu but we're only really interested in



134

00:04:55.800 --> 00:04:57.750

two of them at this stage and only one



135

00:04:57.750 --> 00:05:00.090

is really important now the first one is



136

00:05:00.090 --> 00:05:01.800

stay awake you can see that on the



137

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.170

screen there and this prevents the phone



138

00:05:04.170 --> 00:05:06.840

from locking while it's charging so you



139

00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:08.550

won't have to keep unlocking it or



140

00:05:08.550 --> 00:05:10.560

testing your app it saves a bit of time



141

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:12.180

and annoyance but if you don't have that



142

00:05:12.180 --> 00:05:13.980

option then don't worry but if you do



143

00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.600

have it then it might be a good idea to



144

00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:17.040

ticket and that's if you have something



145

00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.660

like a password or pattern there's no



146

00:05:18.660 --> 00:05:20.340

case to unlock your phone so I'm going



147

00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:23.070

to select that anyway to leave it on so



148

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:25.500

that you'll never sleep all charging so



149

00:05:25.500 --> 00:05:27.480

that the sames has a bit of tom during



150

00:05:27.480 --> 00:05:30.240

our testing but the important test



151

00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.610

setting is USB debugging so I need to



152

00:05:32.610 --> 00:05:34.860

scroll down a little bit to see that and



153

00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:36.360

there's USB debugging and the debugging



154

00:05:36.360 --> 00:05:38.910

menu there now without this one set you



155

00:05:38.910 --> 00:05:40.320

won't be able to test apps on your



156

00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.690

device from Android studio so you need



157

00:05:42.690 --> 00:05:44.550

to make sure you turn on USB debugging



158

00:05:44.550 --> 00:05:47.490

so I'm going to do that and you can see



159

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:48.480

we've got this pop-up and you'll



160

00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.919

probably get a similar message on your



161

00:05:49.919 --> 00:05:52.620

phone and it's asking us to confirm that



162

00:05:52.620 --> 00:05:54.510

we want to allow us debugging in this



163

00:05:54.510 --> 00:05:55.950

case that's forward because we are using



164

00:05:55.950 --> 00:05:57.990

it for development purposes I'm going to



165

00:05:57.990 --> 00:06:01.080

click on OK so once that's done you want



166

00:06:01.080 --> 00:06:02.669

to plug one end of the USB cable into



167

00:06:02.669 --> 00:06:03.870

the phone and the other into the



168

00:06:03.870 --> 00:06:06.270

computer, so I'm going to stay on my



169

00:06:06.270 --> 00:06:08.100

phone display and select that there and



170

00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:10.740

play my device in but just before that



171

00:06:10.740 --> 00:06:11.910

what I'm going to do is switch back to



172

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:14.130

Android studio and I want to bring up



173

00:06:14.130 --> 00:06:15.960

the screen where we normally start our



174

00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:18.230

app so I'm gonna come back to there now



175

00:06:18.230 --> 00:06:21.110

so we're going to click on the run menu



176

00:06:21.110 --> 00:06:23.190

and you can see here on the list of



177

00:06:23.190 --> 00:06:25.620

connected devices at the moment there's



178

00:06:25.620 --> 00:06:27.150

nothing there's only the virtual device



179

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.430

that we've previously configured that we



180

00:06:29.430 --> 00:06:31.590

ran our app in in the last video there's



181

00:06:31.590 --> 00:06:32.880

nothing under connected devices I'm



182

00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:34.020

going to come back to that shortly but



183

00:06:34.020 --> 00:06:36.120

for now we'll go back to the screen on



184

00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:38.100

my phone again I'm going to plug in the



185

00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.000

cable and I've now got this message



186

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.830

appearing on my phone it says allow USB



187

00:06:43.830 --> 00:06:46.020

debugging and it's giving me the



188

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:47.940

a message about the computers RSA key



189

00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:50.490

fingerprint which I have to obscure for



190

00:06:50.490 --> 00:06:52.620

security reasons but it's just basically



191

00:06:52.620 --> 00:06:54.840

a large number and it's asking us



192

00:06:54.840 --> 00:06:56.669

whether we want to allow that and we



193

00:06:56.669 --> 00:06:57.840

switch back over to Android studio



194

00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.389

quickly you can see at the moment under



195

00:07:00.389 --> 00:07:02.729

connected devices there's a code there



196

00:07:02.729 --> 00:07:05.970

and it says offline at the moment so



197

00:07:05.970 --> 00:07:07.199

what I'm going to do now if I switch



198

00:07:07.199 --> 00:07:09.000

back to my phone's display is I'm going



199

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.379

to click on always allow from this



200

00:07:10.379 --> 00:07:12.090

computer because this is going to be my



201

00:07:12.090 --> 00:07:14.159

major main test computer and I'm going



202

00:07:14.159 --> 00:07:15.180

to click on OK



203

00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:16.530

and once we do that we'll switch back



204

00:07:16.530 --> 00:07:20.400

over to Android studio time ok there.



205

00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:21.720

and now if we switch back to Android studio



206

00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.150

you can see under connected devices this



207

00:07:24.150 --> 00:07:27.180

LG Nexus 5x and that'll be your phone's



208

00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.000

model and tells you also the API that's



209

00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:31.620

running in my case I'm running Android 8



210

00:07:31.620 --> 00:07:34.229

on this phone API 26, I've now got a



211

00:07:34.229 --> 00:07:37.050

device that we can actually test on so



212

00:07:37.050 --> 00:07:38.280

basically what we've done is we've set



213

00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.469

up the phone and allowed it or given it



214

00:07:40.469 --> 00:07:42.000

access so that we can use it to run



215

00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.690

applications to test and again with the



216

00:07:44.690 --> 00:07:47.430

deployment target on you can see that



217

00:07:47.430 --> 00:07:49.289

we've got this Nexus 5x available it's



218

00:07:49.289 --> 00:07:50.430

an option here which wasn't there before



219

00:07:50.430 --> 00:07:52.830

and we've still got our available



220

00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:54.509

virtual device which is for running the



221

00:07:54.509 --> 00:07:56.340

emulator but we've never got a real



222

00:07:56.340 --> 00:07:57.719

device as well which are going to be



223

00:07:57.719 --> 00:08:00.150

using to run now. So you can use the same



224

00:08:00.150 --> 00:08:02.279

mechanism and some views before you can



225

00:08:02.279 --> 00:08:04.650

just come up here and select run and



226

00:08:04.650 --> 00:08:06.900

choose either the connected device and



227

00:08:06.900 --> 00:08:10.529

just if I unplug the USB cable now so



228

00:08:10.529 --> 00:08:12.210

I'll do now you can see that that then



229

00:08:12.210 --> 00:08:14.069

disappears connected device is known and



230

00:08:14.069 --> 00:08:18.029

if I plug it back in again give it a



231

00:08:18.029 --> 00:08:19.020

moment you can see that it actually



232

00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:20.340

comes back again, so once we've done that



233

00:08:20.340 --> 00:08:22.740

one time configuration you'll be able to



234

00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:24.659

access this without going into any menus



235

00:08:24.659 --> 00:08:27.810

or sitting anything else up and keep in



236

00:08:27.810 --> 00:08:28.979

mind that if you're running on Windows



237

00:08:28.979 --> 00:08:30.690

you should probably also disconnect the



238

00:08:30.690 --> 00:08:32.969

device properly from the taskbar as he



239

00:08:32.969 --> 00:08:34.469

would like a USB memory stick or



240

00:08:34.469 --> 00:08:36.270

something on those lines but obviously



241

00:08:36.270 --> 00:08:38.789

in my case on a Mac I haven't known



242

00:08:38.789 --> 00:08:40.529

anything to the phone storage have



243

00:08:40.529 --> 00:08:42.240

written any data to the phone so it was



244

00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:44.579

ok just to unplug it. Now if your phone



245

00:08:44.579 --> 00:08:46.980

doesn't appear or you can see you can't



246

00:08:46.980 --> 00:08:48.690

see its full name or the serial number



247

00:08:48.690 --> 00:08:50.459

that probably means that you haven't



248

00:08:50.459 --> 00:08:51.870

ticked the USB debugging and the



249

00:08:51.870 --> 00:08:53.070

developers options that I showed you



250

00:08:53.070 --> 00:08:54.510

earlier in this video



251

00:08:54.510 --> 00:08:56.160

or that you haven't allowed access from



252

00:08:56.160 --> 00:08:58.589

your computer. In my case, let's actually try



253

00:08:58.589 --> 00:08:59.670

running this I'm gonna



254

00:08:59.670 --> 00:09:02.100

okay to start it running and they were



255

00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:03.570

going to switch back to my Google Nexus



256

00:09:03.570 --> 00:09:06.240

5x phone and check that it works you got



257

00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:10.590

okay and I go back to the phone now and



258

00:09:10.590 --> 00:09:12.810

you can see there on my phone that the



259

00:09:12.810 --> 00:09:14.550

app was launched automatically and we've



260

00:09:14.550 --> 00:09:15.930

got the hello world application now



261

00:09:15.930 --> 00:09:20.790

running on my Google Nexus 5x now by the



262

00:09:20.790 --> 00:09:22.230

way you don't need to be running oreo



263

00:09:22.230 --> 00:09:24.840

api 26 on your phone as long as your



264

00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:27.540

phone is running API 17 or higher then



265

00:09:27.540 --> 00:09:29.400

the app should work but if your phone



266

00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:31.110

isn't running at least the minimum SDK



267

00:09:31.110 --> 00:09:33.960

that we set you'll get a message when



268

00:09:33.960 --> 00:09:35.930

you select the vise and click ok,



269

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:38.520

and in fact looking at the slide here



270

00:09:38.520 --> 00:09:40.200

you'll see that there was actually a an



271

00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:42.270

indication of this in the phone's



272

00:09:42.270 --> 00:09:44.790

description before clicking ok, so again



273

00:09:44.790 --> 00:09:45.870

your phone needs to be running the



274

00:09:45.870 --> 00:09:49.170

minimum SDK that we set which was API 17



275

00:09:49.170 --> 00:09:53.040

when we configured this project. Now if



276

00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.330

that's the only physical device you've



277

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:57.180

got, you can change the minimum SDK you



278

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:59.520

can go to file project structure and



279

00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.980

file project structure,



280

00:10:01.980 --> 00:10:08.310

I mean click on app down here and you



281

00:10:08.310 --> 00:10:10.650

can see we've got on the flavors tab



282

00:10:10.650 --> 00:10:12.870

come over here the flavors we've got



283

00:10:12.870 --> 00:10:15.420

minimum SDK version and you can change



284

00:10:15.420 --> 00:10:16.830

that to match the version of Android



285

00:10:16.830 --> 00:10:18.780

running on your phone and we can select



286

00:10:18.780 --> 00:10:20.790

that, but actually it doesn't really



287

00:10:20.790 --> 00:10:22.350

matter what's available is to drop down



288

00:10:22.350 --> 00:10:24.360

because what you can actually do is you



289

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:26.190

can just type the API number that you



290

00:10:26.190 --> 00:10:28.740

want to set into the box, so for example



291

00:10:28.740 --> 00:10:31.410

if you're using an API 16 device you



292

00:10:31.410 --> 00:10:33.930

change the 17 to a 16 just by typing it,



293

00:10:33.930 --> 00:10:39.420

click ok and the project updates you see



294

00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:41.870

down the bottom grad was working away



295

00:10:41.870 --> 00:10:44.190

and from that point when you go to run



296

00:10:44.190 --> 00:10:45.690

it again after it finished updating



297

00:10:45.690 --> 00:10:47.820

you'd be able to run that on your



298

00:10:47.820 --> 00:10:49.860

phone assuming in this particular case



299

00:10:49.860 --> 00:10:54.090

it was an API 16 device but in the case



300

00:10:54.090 --> 00:10:55.470

of what we did I was going to go back



301

00:10:55.470 --> 00:10:57.270

and make that change again go back into



302

00:10:57.270 --> 00:11:00.870

project structure. Now click on flavors



303

00:11:00.870 --> 00:11:02.340

I'm going to set it back to what it was



304

00:11:02.340 --> 00:11:05.070

which was in my case 17 being the



305

00:11:05.070 --> 00:11:06.510

minimum version that we defined the



306

00:11:06.510 --> 00:11:09.450

start of this project, so this is example



307

00:11:09.450 --> 00:11:12.790

was long issue phones running API 17 or higher,



308

00:11:12.790 --> 00:11:14.650

it should work fine if not you just need



309

00:11:14.650 --> 00:11:16.930

to change the minimum SDK level as you



310

00:11:16.930 --> 00:11:20.230

saw me do there, but with 96% of devices



311

00:11:20.230 --> 00:11:22.750

now running API 17 or higher it should



312

00:11:22.750 --> 00:11:24.940

be fine in most cases, so that's it



313

00:11:24.940 --> 00:11:26.230

that's how to run an app on your phone



314

00:11:26.230 --> 00:11:28.480

rather than using an emulator so it's



315

00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:30.520

running fine as you saw and I'll go back



316

00:11:30.520 --> 00:11:33.490

now briefly to the phone nail and if I



317

00:11:33.490 --> 00:11:36.490

actually rotate it into landscape so



318

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:38.640

I'll move the phone, you can see the app



319

00:11:38.640 --> 00:11:40.450

successfully changes to the landscape



320

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.090

automatically so that's it how to run an



321

00:11:43.090 --> 00:11:44.920

app on your physical device so as long



322

00:11:44.920 --> 00:11:46.570

as you've enabled developer options by



323

00:11:46.570 --> 00:11:48.910

tapping seven times as you saw me do you



324

00:11:48.910 --> 00:11:51.490

can turn USB debugging on whenever you



325

00:11:51.490 --> 00:11:52.810

want to use your phone to test your apps



326

00:11:52.810 --> 00:11:54.760

and you may want to switch off USB



327

00:11:54.760 --> 00:11:56.650

debugging when you're done just remember



328

00:11:56.650 --> 00:11:58.390

to turn it on again when you come back



329

00:11:58.390 --> 00:12:00.250

to developing on it but there's nothing



330

00:12:00.250 --> 00:12:02.320

wrong with leaving USB debugging on if



331

00:12:02.320 --> 00:12:03.610

that's something you want to do when



332

00:12:03.610 --> 00:12:05.710

you're testing on a regular basis.



333

00:12:05.710 --> 00:12:06.820

Alright so that's the end of this section



334

00:12:06.820 --> 00:12:08.860

in the next section we're going to start



335

00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.860

creating proper applications and and I'm



336

00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.940

going to be explaining some of the



337

00:12:12.940 --> 00:12:14.920

concepts like main activity and layouts



338

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.410

and so forth in more detail we haven't



339

00:12:17.410 --> 00:12:19.030

done any programming yet but we've never



340

00:12:19.030 --> 00:12:20.500

got the development environment set up



341

00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:22.420

and we can now run apps using emulators



342

00:12:22.420 --> 00:12:26.490

and physical devices so we're ready to start.
