00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:10.020

Alright so I'm going to finish off this bit on material design by experimenting with a couple of



2

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:11.160

settings.



3

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:15.430

Now we've gone into styles a bit more than you'd need most of the time.



4

00:00:15.460 --> 00:00:21.090

Now you may need to create styles, if you really want to try to make more recent widgets look identical



5

00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:26.880

on earlier Android versions, but a lot of the time you can get very good results just by switching colour



6

00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.870

palettes.



7

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.060

So let's see how that would work.



8

00:00:30.060 --> 00:00:36.570

So I'm going to open up my colors teal deep orange xml file that we downloaded earlier in this section, and copy



9

00:00:36.570 --> 00:00:37.590

the color tags.



10

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:41.250

Let's go to check that out.



11

00:00:41.350 --> 00:00:43.740

So here's my color teal deep orange xml. I'm going to



12

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:49.300

open that with an editor, and I'll size this right up so that you can see it.



13

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:55.210

And we're just going to copy the color tags only. Back into Android Studio.



14

00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.330

We're going into our values styles.xml,



15

00:00:58.420 --> 00:01:03.420

and we're just going to literally replace the colours. I'm going to just select all the existing colors and paste



16

00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:04.770

directly over the top there,



17

00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:07.740

basically replacing the colours already there.



18

00:01:07.740 --> 00:01:11.390

And now if we run the app, we should find we get a completely different look.



19

00:01:13.060 --> 00:01:15.280

I'm going to run it on all three emulators as well,



20

00:01:25.660 --> 00:01:30.240

and you can see that the theme runs throughout the app, and we get the same styling right through.



21

00:01:30.250 --> 00:01:34.690

And if I go through and do a long tap on a thumbnail inside the API 16 emulator,



22

00:01:37.850 --> 00:01:48.160

and do the same say for the 21, API 21, long tap, and then lastly API 26.



23

00:01:48.390 --> 00:01:53.940

Now that doesn't look too good on API 26, but that's because I was messing around with the color background



24

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.380

floating attribute in the last video.



25

00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:58.050

So I'm going to put that back to what it should be



26

00:01:58.050 --> 00:02:00.190

now. Let's go back and do that in Android Studio.



27

00:02:02.780 --> 00:02:06.800

So back here, remember we changed that to @color/accent,



28

00:02:06.810 --> 00:02:10.660

so we'll change that to primary which is what it should've been.



29

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:14.220

And if we run the app again now on all three emulators,



30

00:02:24.990 --> 00:02:25.910

and there should be no change



31

00:02:25.950 --> 00:02:30.510

to the other emulators, the API 17 and API 21.



32

00:02:31.500 --> 00:02:33.010

Put on API 26.



33

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.380

We've now got a consistent look across all three versions.



34

00:02:36.450 --> 00:02:42.050

Now one thing that isn't very friendly though, are those hex codes for the numbers. So we'll go back into our styles



35

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:42.790

dot xml,



36

00:02:42.930 --> 00:02:50.220

so these numbers here, these hex codes. It could be useful to refer to them using more descriptive names. Now if



37

00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:55.300

you're going to use that website to generate the xml for you, then it's less important to do this.



38

00:02:55.350 --> 00:03:00.060

But if you want to use names instead of numbers, then the good news is that someone's already created



39

00:03:00.060 --> 00:03:03.810

a file containing all those material design colours.



40

00:03:03.810 --> 00:03:08.350

I'm going to link you to the page and just briefly go to that in a browser, and it's on github.



41

00:03:08.790 --> 00:03:12.720

There's the link there.



42

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:20.010

You can see all the various styles and they've actually named them, so you can refer to them by name.



43

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:21.360

So we can download the zip file,



44

00:03:24.490 --> 00:03:26.020

save it somewhere.



45

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:31.860

And if I go to that folder, and I want to max, I'm going to open that folder.



46

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:35.530

Go into the folder, you can see there's this xml file there.



47

00:03:35.830 --> 00:03:38.610

So we can just literally take that file and copy that,



48

00:03:38.830 --> 00:03:41.790

and I can paste it directly into the values folder



49

00:03:41.870 --> 00:03:45.510

in Android Studio, so I'm going to go back and do that. So the values folder,



50

00:03:45.740 --> 00:03:55.190

I'm going to paste it. I'm going to leave the default name there, android material design colors dot xml,



51

00:03:55.460 --> 00:04:00.930

and you can see now that we've done that, we've actually got a descriptive representation of the colours, basically



52

00:04:00.930 --> 00:04:05.820

friendly names, cross referenced nicely to the colour charts on the Google page that we looked at a few



53

00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:06.640

videos ago.



54

00:04:07.170 --> 00:04:11.920

And at that point it's then very easy to use those friendly names instead of the hex codes.



55

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:18.030

So we went back now to the styles.xml, instead of putting say the code for primary, the hex code,



56

00:04:18.030 --> 00:04:23.370

we can do something like @color/md teal 500.



57

00:04:26.590 --> 00:04:31.810

Let's go through and change them all while we're here, so @color/md teal 700.



58

00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:40.080

And again you can go back to that Google page to find out what these codes meant for 500 and the one



59

00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:40.950

hundred and so on,



60

00:04:41.130 --> 00:04:45.340

because we did talk about that, or there was a, the Google material design website talked about that in detail.



61

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:47.880

teal 100.



62

00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:57.670

Then accent is going to be md deep orange 500.



63

00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:07.440

primary text is going to be the grey, so it's going to be at @color md grey



64

00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:11.460

900. A few more to go.



65

00:05:11.470 --> 00:05:17.140

secondary text was grey 600, so @color md grey 600.



66

00:05:20.600 --> 00:05:21.410

Icons are white,



67

00:05:21.410 --> 00:05:26.410

so it's going to be @color md white 1000.



68

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.740

And the last one which was a divider,



69

00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:31.040

that's going to be grey 400, so @color



70

00:05:32.130 --> 00:05:36.270

md grey 400.



71

00:05:36.320 --> 00:05:41.690

So basically this highlights the levels of redirection that you can get in Android programming, because



72

00:05:41.690 --> 00:05:49.730

here the style sets, for example, the primary colour up here, to @color primary. That gets looked up and returns



73

00:05:49.770 --> 00:05:53.150

another resource file @color md



74

00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.970

underscore teal 500, and that then gets looked up to get the hex value of the actual colour to use.



75

00:05:59.990 --> 00:06:03.820

So if you want to use friendly names for the colours then you can, instead of hex codes.



76

00:06:03.950 --> 00:06:08.490

But if you're only going to set them once in your color xml file or in the style file,



77

00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:11.030

then you may feel it's not worth including that additional file.



78

00:06:11.060 --> 00:06:12.560

It's completely up to you.



79

00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:18.690

Alright so we can also change the colour of the navigation bar for API 21 and above. Now Android



80

00:06:18.690 --> 00:06:25.310

Studio used to create a v21 slash styles file automatically, but it no longer does that.



81

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:27.300

Now I've sort of done things backwards here.



82

00:06:27.590 --> 00:06:34.650

It would have been a lot tidier if I'd created a v21 styles before creating the v23 styles dot xml



83

00:06:34.730 --> 00:06:35.710

that I've created.



84

00:06:36.170 --> 00:06:38.880

But unless you know exactly where everything is,



85

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:44.070

which means you've memorised all the attributes, and the IP versions that introduced them, then you're going



86

00:06:44.080 --> 00:06:46.190

to find yourself in this position.



87

00:06:46.190 --> 00:06:51.670

And I definitely don't suggest that you try to memorise all of this. So it's quite likely that you'll



88

00:06:51.710 --> 00:06:57.110

want to create another styles file, using an earlier API than you've already defined.



89

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:02.750

And that's where the comment I made earlier, that these individual API version files don't inherit



90

00:07:02.990 --> 00:07:05.610

from the earlier ones, becomes important.



91

00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:09.240

Now as you can see in the v23 styles.xml file,



92

00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:14.230

we've redefined the AppTheme, dot NoActionBar theme.



93

00:07:14.390 --> 00:07:19.270

Now it does inherit from the AppTheme style defined in the original styles.xml.



94

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:24.840

However it doesn't inherit anything from the AppTheme.NoActionBar style in there.



95

00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:32.150

When we create a v21 styles file, what we have to do is copy the complete AppTheme.NoActionBar theme



96

00:07:32.150 --> 00:07:34.900

from the original file, and then modify it.



97

00:07:34.910 --> 00:07:36.400

So let's actually do that.



98

00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:42.580

So we want to come over here and right click on the values folder. Choose New and click on Value resource



99

00:07:42.590 --> 00:07:44.860

file, or Values resource file.



100

00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:49.560

Now the filename will be styles again.



101

00:07:49.650 --> 00:07:56.780

We need to specify API 21 so we scroll down until we get to Version, select that. Use the two greater than signs to



102

00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:57.840

choose it.



103

00:07:58.460 --> 00:08:02.640

The API level will be API 21, or Platform API level will be 21.



104

00:08:02.710 --> 00:08:06.010

Click OK, and you can see we've now got an



105

00:08:06.020 --> 00:08:08.000

empty styles dot



106

00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.850

xml file for v21.



107

00:08:09.900 --> 00:08:14.610

Well empty in the sense that there's no settings, no attributes set within the resource



108

00:08:14.650 --> 00:08:16.160

opening and closing tags.



109

00:08:16.510 --> 00:08:17.880

So we need the AppTheme dot



110

00:08:17.890 --> 00:08:20.850

NoActionBar style from the original file,



111

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:22.560

so I'm going to copy that,



112

00:08:22.670 --> 00:08:24.880

values/style.xml, down here.



113

00:08:25.180 --> 00:08:26.410

So we need to copy this bit here,



114

00:08:26.420 --> 00:08:32.080

these styles dot, style name equals AppTheme.NoActionBar and the two settings. So I'm going to copy both of



115

00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:40.000

those, and go back to our v21 styles. I'm going to paste that in between our resources, our opening and closing resources



116

00:08:40.020 --> 00:08:40.710

tags.



117

00:08:40.960 --> 00:08:45.430

So at this point, to change the navigation bar colour, we need to set the attribute in both v



118

00:08:45.430 --> 00:08:48.740

21 styles and v23 styles.



119

00:08:49.090 --> 00:08:57.210

So to do that, we're going to start with the v21 styles, item name equals two double quotes, and it's going to be android colon, and it's



120

00:08:58.030 --> 00:09:01.440

navigationBarColor.



121

00:09:01.610 --> 00:09:03.930

And we'll go with @color primary



122

00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:09.610

underscore dark, and I'm going to take a copy of that line because we want to do the identical thing in the



123

00:09:09.660 --> 00:09:10.990

v23 styles file.



124

00:09:11.040 --> 00:09:12.930

So let's put that in there as well,



125

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:20.820

like so. And if we run this app again now on all three emulators.



126

00:09:27.500 --> 00:09:28.330

Now I've actually got an



127

00:09:28.330 --> 00:09:34.340

error here, md underscore deep orange, and that's because I didn't put an @color in front of it. You can see that



128

00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:39.980

Android Studio was certainly checking that for us, which you'd want it to do. So that should fix that, and



129

00:09:39.980 --> 00:09:41.700

we'll go back and try that again.



130

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.660

And what we should find is API 21 and API 23 now have a coloured navigation bar at the bottom of the display.



131

00:09:56.730 --> 00:10:03.010

And you can see that's now showing. Basically the navigation bar is now coloured at the bottom of the



132

00:10:03.010 --> 00:10:11.940

display on API 21 and API 26 emulators. Now the navigation bar, if you recall, can't be changed on Android versions before



133

00:10:11.950 --> 00:10:12.920

Lollipop.



134

00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:15.730

Now there's nothing we can do about the navigation bar before Lollipop,



135

00:10:15.790 --> 00:10:21.040

so the important thing to focus on is making sure your app works and looks good. And it can be futile



136

00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:26.680

trying to make it look identical across all versions of Android, because there will be times when older devices



137

00:10:26.680 --> 00:10:28.720

just don't have the same capabilities.



138

00:10:28.750 --> 00:10:33.610

So don't get too hung up on it looking exactly the same. Alright, so I'm going to stop the video here. In the



139

00:10:33.610 --> 00:10:38.740

next one we're going to start looking at the style editor, and going back to Android Studio,



140

00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:43.060

you may have noticed this Open editor option up here at the top right. so we're going to have a look at what that's



141

00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:44.540

all about in the next video.
