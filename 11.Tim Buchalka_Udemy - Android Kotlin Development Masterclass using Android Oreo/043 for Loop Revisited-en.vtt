00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.900

in the previous video we looked at



2

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.389

looping to repeat a block of code using



3

00:00:09.389 --> 00:00:11.460

the while loop. In this video we're going



4

00:00:11.460 --> 00:00:13.470

to review another kind of loop called a



5

00:00:13.470 --> 00:00:15.630

for loop. Now a for loop does a similar



6

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:18.000

job to a while loop but it's generally



7

00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.680

used when you have some sort of limit



8

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:21.570

that determines how many times you need



9

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.689

to repeat a block of code so we're a



10

00:00:24.689 --> 00:00:26.700

while loop we'll keep looping as long as



11

00:00:26.700 --> 00:00:29.009

the condition remains true a for loop



12

00:00:29.009 --> 00:00:31.140

will execute a set number of times now



13

00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:33.059

we've already looked at the for loop



14

00:00:33.059 --> 00:00:34.950

when we created a show inventory



15

00:00:34.950 --> 00:00:37.530

function in our player class it's a very



16

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:39.539

basic loop that just iterates over each



17

00:00:39.539 --> 00:00:41.640

item in the array list and prints the



18

00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.160

items details so let's actually go ahead



19

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:47.370

and make it do a bit more now s our



20

00:00:47.370 --> 00:00:48.870

players wander around killing monsters



21

00:00:48.870 --> 00:00:51.269

they'll pick up loot throughout the game



22

00:00:51.269 --> 00:00:53.579

so let's get the loop to calculate a



23

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:56.249

score by adding up the value of all



24

00:00:56.249 --> 00:00:58.170

their loot at the end of the previous



25

00:00:58.170 --> 00:01:00.030

video they just chase the Dracula away



26

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:01.739

from his hoard which means there should



27

00:01:01.739 --> 00:01:03.179

be a fair bit of loot for them to



28

00:01:03.179 --> 00:01:05.610

collect what I'm gonna do is comment out



29

00:01:05.610 --> 00:01:10.970

the world loop in our main function



30

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.110

to keep the app with a bit clearer and



31

00:01:13.110 --> 00:01:14.220

then we'll get the player to pick up



32

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:16.470

Dracula's hoard well so what we'll do is



33

00:01:16.470 --> 00:01:18.119

we'll also comment out all this code up



34

00:01:18.119 --> 00:01:20.280

here the troll code as well so comment



35

00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.310

all that out and on the wallet that we



36

00:01:23.310 --> 00:01:26.340

added in the last video let's go ahead



37

00:01:26.340 --> 00:01:31.280

and add a new player so Val Kernan



38

00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:35.280

equals player parentheses after the



39

00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:41.130

double and double quotes Conan Conan dot



40

00:01:41.130 --> 00:01:46.640

get loot parentheses loot parentheses



41

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:53.240

invisibility comma loop type dot armor



42

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:57.750

comma 4.0 let's copy at this line I'll



43

00:01:57.750 --> 00:01:59.820

make a few more changes there's another



44

00:01:59.820 --> 00:02:03.810

nine items but obviously change them as



45

00:02:03.810 --> 00:02:05.070

we go through so we'll do invisibility



46

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:10.369

for the first one mithril for the second one



47

00:02:10.369 --> 00:02:17.299

third one being of speed, north one red



48

00:02:17.299 --> 00:02:28.629

potion cursed shield brass ring



49

00:02:28.629 --> 00:02:31.250

well mostly missing game type mixing



50

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:34.220

game types here some of this stuff is



51

00:02:34.220 --> 00:02:35.480

from different games but that's a run at



52

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:37.549

all served well as an example chain



53

00:02:37.549 --> 00:02:45.190

maille gold ring health potion and



54

00:02:45.190 --> 00:02:49.519

silver ring is the last one for what we



55

00:02:49.519 --> 00:02:52.459

need to change the item top so which was



56

00:02:52.459 --> 00:02:53.810

also am i sorry you can leave that one



57

00:02:53.810 --> 00:02:55.849

third one ring of spain is obviously a



58

00:02:55.849 --> 00:03:00.790

ring red potion obviously is a potion



59

00:03:00.790 --> 00:03:03.680

curse shield well that's obviously armor



60

00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.569

got a brass ring obviously a ring



61

00:03:07.569 --> 00:03:11.319

chainmail armor gold ring is a ring



62

00:03:11.319 --> 00:03:16.160

health potion potion and silver ring is



63

00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:18.739

obviously a ring the last thing I need



64

00:03:18.739 --> 00:03:20.900

to do now is give the values to them so



65

00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.549

invisibility that should have been a



66

00:03:22.549 --> 00:03:24.459

potion as wealth has changed that



67

00:03:24.459 --> 00:03:28.010

obviously the visibility's not armor



68

00:03:28.010 --> 00:03:31.819

okay so 4.04 the first one we're going



69

00:03:31.819 --> 00:03:33.290

to permit your alarm we're going to give



70

00:03:33.290 --> 00:03:36.859

that 183 it's the score ring of speed



71

00:03:36.859 --> 00:03:41.690

let's make that 25 okay red potion will



72

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:46.340

go with to curse shield that's a bad



73

00:03:46.340 --> 00:03:47.870

thing so we're going to go a negative



74

00:03:47.870 --> 00:03:52.699

eight brass ring value of 1 chainmail



75

00:03:52.699 --> 00:03:54.410

let's go with a bail of 4 for that solid



76

00:03:54.410 --> 00:03:57.109

then on the default gold ring let's



77

00:03:57.109 --> 00:04:00.620

change the fourth over 12 health potion



78

00:04:00.620 --> 00:04:04.459

let's go with 3 for that then the silver ring



79

00:04:04.459 --> 00:04:08.930

lastly we'll go with a value of 6 okay



80

00:04:08.930 --> 00:04:12.739

and then lastly as to a conan dots show



81

00:04:12.739 --> 00:04:19.090

inventory okay let's run that



82

00:04:19.090 --> 00:04:20.709

you can see there that Conan is they've



83

00:04:20.709 --> 00:04:23.260

got quite a stash of loot but what's all



84

00:04:23.260 --> 00:04:24.130

the loot worth



85

00:04:24.130 --> 00:04:26.800

so let's modify the for loop to loop



86

00:04:26.800 --> 00:04:28.750

through all the items in Conan's stash



87

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:31.960

and work out the total value so we're



88

00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:33.520

gonna go back to the show inventory



89

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:39.970

function in the player class ok and what



90

00:04:39.970 --> 00:04:41.260

I'm gonna do start out by making a



91

00:04:41.260 --> 00:04:43.480

mistake here because it's such a common



92

00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.430

mistake to make and it's a minor thing



93

00:04:45.430 --> 00:04:47.320

so as long as you can spawn it quickly



94

00:04:47.320 --> 00:04:49.180

you can get back to writing code without



95

00:04:49.180 --> 00:04:51.430

losing your train of thought so what



96

00:04:51.430 --> 00:04:53.890

we're going to do after the printing of



97

00:04:53.890 --> 00:04:56.560

the items will actually print learn of



98

00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.590

the item we're going to put total plus



99

00:04:59.590 --> 00:05:03.700

equals item value but we also need to



100

00:05:03.700 --> 00:05:06.040

add that variable so we add that at the



101

00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.660

first line of the supplementary function



102

00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:11.080

they're total equals zero so we come



103

00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:19.990

down here and then a cup of lines total



104

00:05:19.990 --> 00:05:25.390

score is : dollar total so you can see



105

00:05:25.390 --> 00:05:28.240

that on the first line line 47 I started



106

00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:30.640

out by creating gather variable total



107

00:05:30.640 --> 00:05:32.800

and it's set it initially to zero will



108

00:05:32.800 --> 00:05:34.690

be accumulating the total value of the



109

00:05:34.690 --> 00:05:37.150

loot in this variable but the mistake I



110

00:05:37.150 --> 00:05:40.030

made was to initialize it to zero this



111

00:05:40.030 --> 00:05:42.850

is the code here on line 47 by doing



112

00:05:42.850 --> 00:05:45.610

that I'll make it an int so we get an error



113

00:05:45.610 --> 00:05:47.560

we try to add a double value to it down



114

00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:48.970

here you can see their type mismatch



115

00:05:48.970 --> 00:05:52.570

quiet int found double even though the



116

00:05:52.570 --> 00:05:54.370

error is showing here the actual problem



117

00:05:54.370 --> 00:05:56.770

was caused by us initializing it to zero



118

00:05:56.770 --> 00:06:00.130

chance of to 0.0 you can see the error



119

00:06:00.130 --> 00:06:03.190

and then disappears so that's a very



120

00:06:03.190 --> 00:06:05.080

common mistake to make as I said so



121

00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:07.180

watch out for that and that a very easy



122

00:06:07.180 --> 00:06:08.620

solution is you can see up there just



123

00:06:08.620 --> 00:06:10.030

making sure that you're initializing it



124

00:06:10.030 --> 00:06:12.850

to the correct type all right so each



125

00:06:12.850 --> 00:06:14.590

time around the loop we had the items



126

00:06:14.590 --> 00:06:17.200

value to total that way we build up the



127

00:06:17.200 --> 00:06:20.050

total value of our inventory and when



128

00:06:20.050 --> 00:06:21.460

the loop terminates been printing out



129

00:06:21.460 --> 00:06:24.160

the total value of all the loot so we



130

00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:30.190

actually run this now



131

00:06:30.190 --> 00:06:32.780

you can see we got the total score the



132

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.750

total loot value if you will of 232



133

00:06:35.750 --> 00:06:38.000

that's the total value of all the loot



134

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.730

now being of a suspicious disposition



135

00:06:40.730 --> 00:06:43.070

Conan examined that cursed shield



136

00:06:43.070 --> 00:06:45.590

carefully and decided to leave it in the



137

00:06:45.590 --> 00:06:47.510

Dracula's lair so I'm going to comment



138

00:06:47.510 --> 00:06:52.730

that line out and I've actually run this



139

00:06:52.730 --> 00:06:55.460

again we should fire that there's less



140

00:06:55.460 --> 00:06:57.260

items now in the inventory fewer items



141

00:06:57.260 --> 00:06:59.090

and the loop goes around 9 times instead



142

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:01.370

of 10 and the score has now gone up to



143

00:07:01.370 --> 00:07:04.730

240 of course because we've removed the



144

00:07:04.730 --> 00:07:07.850

curse shield which was adding negative 8



145

00:07:07.850 --> 00:07:10.580

to our total so that's a for loop in



146

00:07:10.580 --> 00:07:12.800

Kotlin other languages such as c plus



147

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.870

possible jar i have another form of for



148

00:07:14.870 --> 00:07:17.240

loop in fact this form is called the for



149

00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.700

each in those languages but Kotlin



150

00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.830

doesn't have another form in Kotlin of



151

00:07:21.830 --> 00:07:24.050

for loop works by iterating over a set



152

00:07:24.050 --> 00:07:26.150

of values if you don't have a set of



153

00:07:26.150 --> 00:07:28.040

values to iterate over i just want to



154

00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:29.480

repeat a block of code a certain number



155

00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:31.580

of times what you can do is create a



156

00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:34.490

range of values so to see what I mean



157

00:07:34.490 --> 00:07:36.920

let's comment out all this conan code



158

00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:41.590

you know main method our main function



159

00:07:41.590 --> 00:07:45.200

let's put back the Dracula slaying code



160

00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.330

so just as code here that starts with



161

00:07:47.330 --> 00:07:50.390

the vampire king dracula will uncomment



162

00:07:50.390 --> 00:07:55.220

that we're also going to change it in



163

00:07:55.220 --> 00:07:58.700

line 23 that was take was inflicting 12



164

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:00.560

points of damage has changed that number



165

00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:05.720

to 80 then we actually run this she'll



166

00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:06.650

be able to see the damage being



167

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:09.080

inflicted and directly eventually runs



168

00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:11.150

away so you can see now there's a random



169

00:08:11.150 --> 00:08:13.190

element to it when Dracula dodges so you



170

00:08:13.190 --> 00:08:14.660

may want to simulate the battle a few



171

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:16.550

times you can see in this particular



172

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:18.620

case he didn't dodge at all so we try



173

00:08:18.620 --> 00:08:24.530

running it again this time he did manage



174

00:08:24.530 --> 00:08:30.250

to do some dodging



175

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:34.340

okay eventually runs away now we could



176

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.650

run it repeatedly but just to show what



177

00:08:36.650 --> 00:08:39.050

I mean about creating a range I'm gonna



178

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:41.659

get the program to run all this code ten



179

00:08:41.659 --> 00:08:44.000

times only so what we need to do to do



180

00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.770

that is we want to wrap all this code in



181

00:08:45.770 --> 00:08:48.470

a for loop so I'm going to go ahead and



182

00:08:48.470 --> 00:08:52.390

create the for loop so for parentheses I



183

00:08:52.390 --> 00:08:57.290

in one space two dots two periods in



184

00:08:57.290 --> 00:08:59.390

other words ten and if you create a code



185

00:08:59.390 --> 00:09:01.430

block I'm going to put all that code in



186

00:09:01.430 --> 00:09:06.230

that code block okay cut that paste it



187

00:09:06.230 --> 00:09:08.420

into that code block we created for the



188

00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:10.190

for loop and what I'm going to do is



189

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.350

just add a row of dashes just to make it



190

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.750

easier to see when each batter wins so



191

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:16.820

I'm going to put that in here before the



192

00:09:16.820 --> 00:09:21.140

closing for loop printing this would add



193

00:09:21.140 --> 00:09:25.520

some dashes here so now when I run the



194

00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:30.920

program we get ten runs of the battle



195

00:09:30.920 --> 00:09:33.320

with Dracula should be dodging at



196

00:09:33.320 --> 00:09:35.930

different times in each one you can see



197

00:09:35.930 --> 00:09:37.880

each batter was separated by the dashes



198

00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:42.250

that we added



199

00:09:42.250 --> 00:09:45.610

and so on run up to the top so we had to



200

00:09:45.610 --> 00:09:47.530

provide a range of values for the for



201

00:09:47.530 --> 00:09:49.390

loop to iterate over we did that on line



202

00:09:49.390 --> 00:09:52.090

13 because there's no list to loop



203

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:53.920

through. Alright so that's the for loop



204

00:09:53.920 --> 00:09:55.360

so I'm going to stop the video here and



205

00:09:55.360 --> 00:09:57.400

in the next one we'll look at the third



206

00:09:57.400 --> 00:09:59.410

top of loop, we'll be using the do-while



207

00:09:59.410 --> 00:10:03.690

loop, so I'll see you in the next video.
