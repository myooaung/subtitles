1
00:00:05,480 --> 00:00:10,590
So continuing on from the last video, where I showed you that video presentation from Google. You can

2
00:00:10,590 --> 00:00:15,750
see that on the right of each of these colour charts, so I'll scroll down to display a few more,

3
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:18,130
there's a hex code for each colour.

4
00:00:18,500 --> 00:00:19,920
Now it's that value

5
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:25,620
the computer ultimately needs, when you use a certain colour in your app. Now the hex codes are three hex

6
00:00:25,620 --> 00:00:30,020
bytes, representing the amount of red, green and blue in each colour.

7
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:35,190
So up in the reds, if we start up in there, there's the first two digits which can be quite large compared

8
00:00:35,190 --> 00:00:36,420
to the next two.

9
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:44,880
But as we move down to the blues, over here to the right, the last pair of digits are dominant and in the greens,

10
00:00:44,970 --> 00:00:50,590
if we scroll down even further, the middle pair are larger because there's more green in those colors.

11
00:00:50,590 --> 00:00:56,170
Now the numbers on the left by the way, are Google indicating possible uses of each colour.

12
00:00:56,380 --> 00:01:00,050
So if I picked the plain blue, going back up to blue again,

13
00:01:01,630 --> 00:01:10,020
so the plain blue, the 500 colour over here, would be used for the toolbar, with the status bar using the 700

14
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:10,490
colour

15
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:12,360
down here, for example.

16
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:13,570
Now the short video

17
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:16,920
gave a good idea of what they had in mind with these colours.

18
00:01:16,930 --> 00:01:23,230
So again, 500 you'd use that code, 700 you'd use this hex code.

19
00:01:23,310 --> 00:01:28,750
Now looking at these examples a little bit further down the page, in the color system section, if I come down to

20
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:29,560
there and have a look,

21
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:37,740
Color system section as you can see there, there's examples of different colour schemes. Now take some time to read through

22
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:43,610
at least the basics, because it gives you a good idea of how things like accent colours will help you

23
00:01:43,640 --> 00:01:45,150
to create great looking apps.

24
00:01:46,650 --> 00:01:52,140
So I think personally it's great that Google have done this, because they're giving us a set of criteria

25
00:01:52,440 --> 00:01:56,730
to design our apps, to make sure they fit in with the general Android styling.

26
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:00,500
And it's a good unifying experience from a user's perspective.

27
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:05,000
So in other words, your app isn't going to look out of place compared to other apps.

28
00:02:05,060 --> 00:02:10,240
Now you can imagine if you don't use these philosophies or these principles, and do things your own way,

29
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:16,030
your apps can look very funky and very out there, and not fit in with the overall theme that pretty well all

30
00:02:16,050 --> 00:02:18,090
the other apps are actually following.

31
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:24,480
So that's what this website's for. The design colour guidelines are there to help you with those color choices

32
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:25,430
and so forth,

33
00:02:25,770 --> 00:02:29,110
and there's actually so much information on this website.

34
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:31,240
Now we'll look at how to use these principles,

35
00:02:31,380 --> 00:02:36,420
when we set the colours for our Flickr browser app, and you'll see that we don't normally set colours or individual

36
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:37,420
widgets.

37
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:43,140
Instead we just choose the colours for our theme, and let Android apply the colours. And it'll do that in

38
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:44,540
a consistent way,

39
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:49,460
so we don't have to worry about changing the colour of everything that we want to display on the screen.

40
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:51,140
Alright, so we've talked about colour,

41
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:54,420
but under Style over here to the left in the menu,

42
00:02:54,420 --> 00:02:59,640
we can see what they suggest about icons. I'm going to click on that, and they actually

43
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:00,360
give

44
00:03:00,530 --> 00:03:05,410
design guidelines about icons, which is great if you're designing your own icons.

45
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:07,950
Now typography is also interesting.

46
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:12,810
In fact it's all interesting. There's great information on this website. Now with Android Oreo,

47
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,620
Google have made it much easier to use different fonts in your apps. They've made a font installation a lot

48
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:21,800
easier, and you don't have to package loads of fonts with your apps.

49
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:23,820
They can actually be downloaded as needed.

50
00:03:23,980 --> 00:03:27,160
Now by the way I don't want you to think you need to memorise all of this.

51
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:32,660
However it is a great place to start, to just sort of get your head around a little bit of what some of

52
00:03:32,660 --> 00:03:39,350
the things are, what Material Design is in more detail, but also what Google is expecting you

53
00:03:39,350 --> 00:03:41,900
to use from a material design point of view

54
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:49,500
for Android apps. Alright so I'm going to finish by going into Components, over here in the menu. Down here you

55
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:55,360
can see they even go into things like cards, and click on that. Now they talk about several layouts and show you

56
00:03:55,410 --> 00:04:03,080
lots of examples of usages of various cards, as you can see down there, as I'm scrolling down.

57
00:04:03,330 --> 00:04:09,090
You can't really go wrong, in the sense that Google have done a lot of the work, and given you the design

58
00:04:09,090 --> 00:04:12,830
principles to use to make your apps look really good.

59
00:04:12,960 --> 00:04:17,520
Now of course if you've got user design experience then you're free to do what you want, but as soon

60
00:04:17,520 --> 00:04:22,830
as you move away from using Material Design, then you'll have a lot more work to do because you'll have

61
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:26,430
to set the colours on everything that you display on the screen.

62
00:04:26,430 --> 00:04:30,020
So at this point you might be wondering is Material Design really worth it.

63
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:36,120
Well in our opinion, it's very much something that you should be using in your apps. So it's not just for

64
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,160
Android Lollipop and above either. One of the really cool things which we'll be talking about next is

65
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:42,870
app compatibility.

66
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:46,860
Before that though, I want to show you another site that's great for sorting out all this material design

67
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:48,490
colour stuff.

68
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:50,380
So I'm going to go to the site now.

69
00:04:50,670 --> 00:04:52,720
Let's open a new tab.

70
00:04:52,780 --> 00:04:54,660
You can see it's materialpalette dot com.

71
00:04:55,990 --> 00:04:58,120
Now this is a really useful site.

72
00:04:58,120 --> 00:05:03,070
It lets you choose your main color and the accent color that you think will go well with it,

73
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:10,690
then it gives you a preview of how they'll look together. So the link at the top right takes you into more material design,

74
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:16,040
and there's a ton of resources on there that you can use for inspiration.

75
00:05:16,090 --> 00:05:20,530
Now not all of this is actually free, but if you're not very good at graphics then it can be worth paying

76
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:21,670
for resources.

77
00:05:21,760 --> 00:05:26,140
Don't be put off though when you get to a page showing prices either, because there's a lot of free sources

78
00:05:26,140 --> 00:05:27,010
still available here.

79
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:30,220
Now the site layout changes from time to time.

80
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:35,530
So you may find the navigation is different when you come to visit, but at the moment the market menu

81
00:05:35,530 --> 00:05:39,850
at the top right gives you an Android option, so click on that. You can see we've got Android down here.

82
00:05:41,040 --> 00:05:46,880
So I click on Android. We get a large selection of resources.

83
00:05:47,090 --> 00:05:52,420
Now the menu at the left over here can be used to filter the content, so click the Show all link down the

84
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:53,110
bottom here.

85
00:05:54,810 --> 00:06:01,320
And when we do that the Java category's a good one to look at. Click on that now.

86
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,000
Now remember the Java code can be mixed with Kotlin,

87
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:09,040
if you're watching this video in my Kotlin Android course. Now you can find things like a user interface

88
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:13,000
for a chat app, that's available to download for free for personal use.

89
00:06:13,060 --> 00:06:15,990
Now you have to register with the site before you can download it though.

90
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,530
OK so that site opened in a new tab,

91
00:06:18,730 --> 00:06:21,560
so I'm going to go back to the palette tab up here.

92
00:06:23,210 --> 00:06:31,360
I'm going to start by clicking on amber as the main colour, down here, and maybe let's go with lime for the second, for the accent.

93
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:37,900
So the first colour you click becomes the primary color and the second becomes the accent.

94
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,690
So as soon as I click lime for the accent, you saw that a palette preview appeared on the right, and I think you'd

95
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:45,400
probably agree that that's pretty hideous.

96
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,220
Well I guess to be fair it's not that bad.

97
00:06:48,220 --> 00:06:50,130
So Google have chosen these colours

98
00:06:50,170 --> 00:06:53,180
so that it's just about impossible to end up with anything really

99
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:54,950
really really bad,

100
00:06:55,120 --> 00:06:57,390
but I'm still not too sure about this choice.

101
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:59,400
So as I click on different colour sets,

102
00:07:01,890 --> 00:07:04,450
the preview shows what they look like in Material Design,

103
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,710
so how they'll appear,

104
00:07:05,850 --> 00:07:11,160
if we just let Android sort out where to use each colour for the palette we chose. So if we try light blue for

105
00:07:11,340 --> 00:07:13,980
another one, and yellow.

106
00:07:14,760 --> 00:07:16,700
Well I guess that that's not brilliant either.

107
00:07:17,070 --> 00:07:20,830
Maybe I should have had a bit more contrast, so perhaps orange might be better than yellow.

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,570
It's a light blue and choose orange.

109
00:07:26,110 --> 00:07:28,730
So again if I go to light blue and yellow again,

110
00:07:30,170 --> 00:07:31,880
and if I come down and click on orange,

111
00:07:31,880 --> 00:07:33,830
of course it changes that to be the primary colour,

112
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,990
not the accent, so it takes a couple of clicks to get used to how selecting works.

113
00:07:38,990 --> 00:07:42,950
So I've now got orange and yellow rather than light blue and orange, but once you've clicked on things a

114
00:07:42,950 --> 00:07:46,420
few times, you get used to how to choose your primary colour.

115
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:49,730
So to choose orange as the accent I'm going to click on light blue again.

116
00:07:52,090 --> 00:07:57,250
So click light blue twice as you can see there, clicking on orange, and now we're back to how we were before now, with

117
00:07:57,250 --> 00:08:00,670
blue and orange as the accent.

118
00:08:01,180 --> 00:08:05,080
So basically the bottom line is the tick, the tick that you know what you've selected, and you can always click

119
00:08:05,080 --> 00:08:08,160
on this colour a second time as I did to untick it.

120
00:08:08,450 --> 00:08:13,960
But what's really useful and interesting at the bottom, at the box at the bottom right showing your palette,

121
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:20,950
down here if I scroll down a little bit, it gives you, it actually gives you the codes for the colours we've chosen.

122
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:25,420
And they're also named quite well, consistent with the terms used in material design.

123
00:08:25,790 --> 00:08:28,220
So once you've got a palette that you're happy with,

124
00:08:28,220 --> 00:08:30,970
you can download it in a number of different formats.

125
00:08:30,980 --> 00:08:33,910
Now the useful one, the most useful one for us is XML.

126
00:08:34,100 --> 00:08:36,590
So I'm going to download a couple of palettes.

127
00:08:36,680 --> 00:08:40,370
Now the orange and yellow didn't look too bad, so I'm going to choose orange first,

128
00:08:42,520 --> 00:08:49,870
then yellow, so you can see up here in our resources. Then come down here and click on download, and I can choose

129
00:08:49,880 --> 00:08:58,160
XML, and I can actually save that. So I'm just going to save that to my desktop. Let's also go and do another one. I'm

130
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:04,000
going to select, let's go with teal, and we'll also go with deep orange,

131
00:09:07,500 --> 00:09:08,910
and you can see what that looks like.

132
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,840
Let's actually save that one as well, so I'll come down here now that I've clicked on download. This menu's

133
00:09:12,840 --> 00:09:14,390
already open, I'm going to click on XML, and you can see we've got

134
00:09:17,090 --> 00:09:20,890
colours, teal, deep orange. Save that.

135
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:22,720
So we've downloaded both of those files.

136
00:09:22,760 --> 00:09:24,900
Now we're going to use these two files when we come to style

137
00:09:24,990 --> 00:09:26,240
our app in a later video.

138
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,100
Now you'll probably want to download two colour schemes that you're happy with, and we'll use them when we come

139
00:09:31,100 --> 00:09:32,830
to style our app as I've mentioned.

140
00:09:32,840 --> 00:09:37,900
So this is a pretty neat site and you'll see how these files will save us a bit of time later.

141
00:09:37,980 --> 00:09:42,240
Now I'm going to stop this video here now, and then in the next one we're going to talk about compatibility,

142
00:09:42,410 --> 00:09:47,480
