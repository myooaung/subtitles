00:00:04.540 --> 00:00:07.180

In the previous video, you saw how to add



2

00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:09.340

an image to our layout using an image



3

00:00:09.340 --> 00:00:11.620

view widget. Now we discussed so



4

00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:13.570

constraints briefly and learnt that



5

00:00:13.570 --> 00:00:15.730

they're like glue that keeps the widget



6

00:00:15.730 --> 00:00:18.640

fixed in place in our layouts. Now we've



7

00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:20.800

also seen how to delete constraints but



8

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.570

they haven't yet had a go at creating



9

00:00:22.570 --> 00:00:24.880

them instead I left you experimenting



10

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:26.919

with the resizing handles that's these



11

00:00:26.919 --> 00:00:29.470

four handles here that can be used to do



12

00:00:29.470 --> 00:00:32.050

just that to resize a widget and



13

00:00:32.050 --> 00:00:33.520

obviously there on each corner of a



14

00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:35.260

widget that is showing in our display.



15

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:37.180

Now there's a reason for doing that



16

00:00:37.180 --> 00:00:39.520

which is that constraining a widget when



17

00:00:39.520 --> 00:00:41.290

it feels the layout can be very fiddly



18

00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:44.170

it is possible but isn't the easiest way



19

00:00:44.170 --> 00:00:46.060

to see how to create constraints for the



20

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.850

first time. Now I actually left my widget



21

00:00:48.850 --> 00:00:50.440

sitting in the top left-hand corner of



22

00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.900

the screen so I resized it down. Now if



23

00:00:52.900 --> 00:00:54.579

you've been experimenting and hopefully



24

00:00:54.579 --> 00:00:56.500

you have then yours could be all over



25

00:00:56.500 --> 00:00:59.260

the place so before we start resize it



26

00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:00.790

so it's right about the same size as



27

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:03.280

mine on screen here now you can also



28

00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:05.170

click on the image and hold the mouse



29

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:07.899

button to drag it around the screen so



30

00:01:07.899 --> 00:01:08.979

I'm going to do that now I'm gonna drag



31

00:01:08.979 --> 00:01:10.120

it around to the middle of the screen



32

00:01:10.120 --> 00:01:12.310

and as I start doing that we start



33

00:01:12.310 --> 00:01:13.600

getting these vertical and horizontal



34

00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:15.670

lines appearing again look at the



35

00:01:15.670 --> 00:01:16.900

vertical one there then I'll move it



36

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.360

down we get the horizontal appearing as



37

00:01:19.360 --> 00:01:21.370

well though those indicate wind



38

00:01:21.370 --> 00:01:23.049

constraints will be set automatically



39

00:01:23.049 --> 00:01:25.150

and they're appearing because we've got



40

00:01:25.150 --> 00:01:27.070

Auto connect turned on which we talked



41

00:01:27.070 --> 00:01:29.380

about in previous video, so if I release



42

00:01:29.380 --> 00:01:31.930

the mouse pointer now, when it's centered



43

00:01:31.930 --> 00:01:34.060

all four constraints should be created



44

00:01:34.060 --> 00:01:35.619

again and you can see that's happened



45

00:01:35.619 --> 00:01:38.200

we've got the constraints showing for



46

00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:41.350

the image view now. Alright, now we saw



47

00:01:41.350 --> 00:01:42.340

two ways



48

00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:43.780

previously to delete individual



49

00:01:43.780 --> 00:01:45.700

constraints but there's also two other



50

00:01:45.700 --> 00:01:48.700

ways to delete constraints. Now the first



51

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:50.110

way is to hover the mouse over the



52

00:01:50.110 --> 00:01:51.820

widget so I'm going to do that now and



53

00:01:51.820 --> 00:01:54.070

noticing that when I did that we get



54

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:55.659

this little button that appears next to



55

00:01:55.659 --> 00:01:57.729

the widget, now if I hover over that we



56

00:01:57.729 --> 00:01:59.530

can see that the tooltip tells us delete



57

00:01:59.530 --> 00:02:02.170

constraints there are only appears when



58

00:02:02.170 --> 00:02:03.820

we first selected the widget so you



59

00:02:03.820 --> 00:02:05.560

might need to select the widget that you



60

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.519

want to delete the constraints off and



61

00:02:08.519 --> 00:02:10.840

obviously by the tooltip it's going to



62

00:02:10.840 --> 00:02:11.950

delete the constraint, so I'm going to



63

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:14.019

click on that and you can see that all



64

00:02:14.019 --> 00:02:16.200

four constraints got deleted.



65

00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.330

Now at this point our image hasn't got



66

00:02:18.330 --> 00:02:19.830

any constraints and it still looks like



67

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.080

it's centered on the screen but keep in



68

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:23.610

mind that it's not actually fixed in



69

00:02:23.610 --> 00:02:26.340

place if we run the app now the widget



70

00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:28.140

would effectively fall off the screen



71

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:30.120

except it doesn't really fall off it



72

00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.640

goes to the top left-hand corner so



73

00:02:32.640 --> 00:02:34.290

let's actually try running it to see and



74

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:37.200

confirm that that is the case now we saw



75

00:02:37.200 --> 00:02:38.790

how to run our apps in an emulator in



76

00:02:38.790 --> 00:02:40.890

section two you want to click on this



77

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.860

green arrow in the Android studio



78

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:46.349

toolbar now I've already got my Android



79

00:02:46.349 --> 00:02:49.170

emulator running but if not you should



80

00:02:49.170 --> 00:02:50.819

be able to select from your list of



81

00:02:50.819 --> 00:02:52.980

developer devices if yours isn't started



82

00:02:52.980 --> 00:02:54.380

and it will start it automatically



83

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:56.040

alternatively you can come back up here



84

00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:58.019

and click on this icon which I can't do



85

00:02:58.019 --> 00:02:59.519

now because I've got this pop-up showing



86

00:02:59.519 --> 00:03:02.970

and select your emulator and run it my



87

00:03:02.970 --> 00:03:04.260

case mine's already connected and



88

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:05.840

running so I'm going to click on OK and



89

00:03:05.840 --> 00:03:11.760

we'll just tap over to see that all



90

00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.350

right so you can see the app started and



91

00:03:13.350 --> 00:03:15.060

there's the image in the top left-hand



92

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:17.850

corner of the display so that shows the



93

00:03:17.850 --> 00:03:20.430

importance of using constraints to make



94

00:03:20.430 --> 00:03:22.109

sure that the widget stays where you



95

00:03:22.109 --> 00:03:24.600

want it to. Now any widget that's not



96

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.640

constrained vertically will move to the



97

00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.190

top of the screen in addition if a



98

00:03:29.190 --> 00:03:30.959

widget isn't constrained horizontally



99

00:03:30.959 --> 00:03:33.870

it'll move to the left-hand edge no apps



100

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:35.130

we have been constrained our widget at



101

00:03:35.130 --> 00:03:36.989

all you can see that it's appearing at



102

00:03:36.989 --> 00:03:39.600

the top on the left-hand edge. Alright,



103

00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:43.260

so let's go back to Android studio what



104

00:03:43.260 --> 00:03:44.820

we're going to do now is create some



105

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.670

constraints. Now the way to do that is to



106

00:03:47.670 --> 00:03:49.470

click on the constraint handle that's



107

00:03:49.470 --> 00:03:51.209

these circles on the left or one the



108

00:03:51.209 --> 00:03:54.120

edges of our widget then drag it out to



109

00:03:54.120 --> 00:03:55.500

where you want to constrain the widget



110

00:03:55.500 --> 00:03:57.810

to, now at the moment we don't have a lot



111

00:03:57.810 --> 00:03:59.700

of choice because you've only got the



112

00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.859

one widget on the screen the only thing



113

00:04:01.859 --> 00:04:03.180

we can really do at this point is to



114

00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:05.280

constrain the widget to the edges of the



115

00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:07.380

screen so we're going to drag each



116

00:04:07.380 --> 00:04:09.540

constraint handle to the corresponding



117

00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:12.090

edge of the screen. Now when I start with



118

00:04:12.090 --> 00:04:14.930

the left hand side and drag that over



119

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:17.220

you can see that automatically the image



120

00:04:17.220 --> 00:04:19.859

is moved to the left hand side and we've



121

00:04:19.859 --> 00:04:21.209

no kind of constraint when I release the



122

00:04:21.209 --> 00:04:23.760

mouse button showing in the blueprint



123

00:04:23.760 --> 00:04:26.250

and the designer but also up here you



124

00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:27.330

can see that we've got two constraint



125

00:04:27.330 --> 00:04:28.879

here on the left hand side.



126

00:04:28.879 --> 00:04:31.050

Now don't worry about the fact that the



127

00:04:31.050 --> 00:04:32.699

widgets moved across to the left there's



128

00:04:32.699 --> 00:04:34.169

no need to keep sort of trying to keep



129

00:04:34.169 --> 00:04:36.360

it central or anything like that that's



130

00:04:36.360 --> 00:04:38.310

what the constraints are for and when I



131

00:04:38.310 --> 00:04:40.379

come over here now it comes constrain



132

00:04:40.379 --> 00:04:42.659

the widget to the right-hand side to the



133

00:04:42.659 --> 00:04:46.139

edge you can see it now it goes over and



134

00:04:46.139 --> 00:04:48.689

centers horizontally it goes back to the



135

00:04:48.689 --> 00:04:50.610

middle in other words all right so at



136

00:04:50.610 --> 00:04:52.289

this point now our image is constrained



137

00:04:52.289 --> 00:04:55.110

horizontally so if we rerun the app and



138

00:04:55.110 --> 00:04:56.340

have a look and see what it's done in



139

00:04:56.340 --> 00:05:01.409

the emulator we can see that it's now



140

00:05:01.409 --> 00:05:03.449

constrained horizontally and it's nicely



141

00:05:03.449 --> 00:05:05.490

in the middle but there's no vertical



142

00:05:05.490 --> 00:05:07.110

constraints on our image view at the



143

00:05:07.110 --> 00:05:08.370

moment so it's still appearing at the



144

00:05:08.370 --> 00:05:10.560

top of the screen but we can see that we



145

00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:14.210

have got the horizontal alignment right.



146

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:16.610

Alright, time for a mini challenge



147

00:05:16.610 --> 00:05:19.229

create the vertical constraints to fix



148

00:05:19.229 --> 00:05:20.759

the image to the center of the screen



149

00:05:20.759 --> 00:05:23.009

and then run the app again to make sure



150

00:05:23.009 --> 00:05:25.319

that they've worked. Alright so pause



151

00:05:25.319 --> 00:05:27.419

the video, now complete that to challenge



152

00:05:27.419 --> 00:05:31.060

and come back and we'll go through the solution.



153

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:33.200

Alright, so hopefully managed to get



154

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.210

that working so to create the vertical



155

00:05:35.210 --> 00:05:37.130

constraints really all we need to do is



156

00:05:37.130 --> 00:05:38.450

just drag the constraint handle from the



157

00:05:38.450 --> 00:05:40.400

middle of the top edge of the image up



158

00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.530

to the top edge of the display so I'll



159

00:05:42.530 --> 00:05:45.050

do that first and you can see that we're



160

00:05:45.050 --> 00:05:47.240

now constrained at the top then widget



161

00:05:47.240 --> 00:05:49.760

moved up to the top accordingly but now



162

00:05:49.760 --> 00:05:54.170

if we constrain the bottom you can see



163

00:05:54.170 --> 00:05:55.760

now that effectively we're centered



164

00:05:55.760 --> 00:05:58.490

horizontally and vertically and just to



165

00:05:58.490 --> 00:05:59.960

confirm that we're going to run this on



166

00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.420

our app our emulator run the app and our



167

00:06:02.420 --> 00:06:05.270

emulator and we can see that the image



168

00:06:05.270 --> 00:06:07.640

view is now centered both vertically and



169

00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:10.370

horizontally so that's what constraints



170

00:06:10.370 --> 00:06:12.710

are for, they fix the position of your



171

00:06:12.710 --> 00:06:14.690

widgets. Now you can fix the widget



172

00:06:14.690 --> 00:06:16.400

either relative to the edges of the



173

00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:19.010

screen like we've done here or relative



174

00:06:19.010 --> 00:06:21.380

to other widgets. Now we'll be seeing how



175

00:06:21.380 --> 00:06:23.060

to start working with other widgets



176

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:24.920

later where we start adding more widgets



177

00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:27.920

to the layout. Alright so I mentioned



178

00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:29.540

that there's two other ways to delete



179

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:31.970

constraints the first way that I showed



180

00:06:31.970 --> 00:06:34.460

you was to use the delete constraints



181

00:06:34.460 --> 00:06:36.500

button on an image view or on a widget



182

00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:38.870

itself which we did previously in this



183

00:06:38.870 --> 00:06:40.940

video. Now there's a similar looking



184

00:06:40.940 --> 00:06:42.710

button on the toolbar and that will



185

00:06:42.710 --> 00:06:44.840

delete all constraints for all widgets



186

00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:47.120

in the layout, so come over here and just



187

00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:49.010

to hover over that one this is one here



188

00:06:49.010 --> 00:06:50.990

you can see that the tooltip has come up



189

00:06:50.990 --> 00:06:53.240

a clear or constraints, now



190

00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:55.640

as we've only got a single widget it'll



191

00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:57.500

do the same as the other button but if



192

00:06:57.500 --> 00:06:59.270

we had a load of widgets on this layout



193

00:06:59.270 --> 00:07:01.100

it would delete the constraints for all



194

00:07:01.100 --> 00:07:01.610

of them.



195

00:07:01.610 --> 00:07:03.320

Now I want to delete all their



196

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:04.970

constraints so they can show you



197

00:07:04.970 --> 00:07:07.280

something else but before I click that



198

00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:09.050

button I want you to have a look at the



199

00:07:09.050 --> 00:07:11.390

inspector over the right-hand side and I



200

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:12.740

need to just click on this to hide the



201

00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:15.110

emulator over here in the top right hand



202

00:07:15.110 --> 00:07:17.600

corner so it shows the four constraints



203

00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:20.090

we've set and it also shows the margins



204

00:07:20.090 --> 00:07:22.310

for each one now at the moment all the



205

00:07:22.310 --> 00:07:24.830

margins are set to 8, although on



206

00:07:24.830 --> 00:07:26.450

the Mac I think when I first created



207

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:28.190

these these constraints at the start of



208

00:07:28.190 --> 00:07:29.750

this video it was showing a zero seems



209

00:07:29.750 --> 00:07:31.550

to be a bit of a bug so hopefully that



210

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:34.220

will be fixed soon but the default



211

00:07:34.220 --> 00:07:36.860

margin was determined by this other



212

00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:40.370

button over here on the toolbar you can



213

00:07:40.370 --> 00:07:42.230

see there that the tooltip pls default



214

00:07:42.230 --> 00:07:44.550

margins and you can see that the current value



215

00:07:44.550 --> 00:07:47.100

is set to eight so that's the value



216

00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:48.660

that's used when you are creating



217

00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:50.670

constraints so what I'm going to do now



218

00:07:50.670 --> 00:07:52.590

is come over here and use the clear all



219

00:07:52.590 --> 00:07:55.230

constraints button click on that to



220

00:07:55.230 --> 00:07:56.670

remove all the constraints for all



221

00:07:56.670 --> 00:07:59.070

widgets on our layout and then I'm going



222

00:07:59.070 --> 00:08:00.870

to change the default margin from eight



223

00:08:00.870 --> 00:08:03.270

we click on that and I can either type



224

00:08:03.270 --> 00:08:04.890

in sixteen there or I can just click on



225

00:08:04.890 --> 00:08:07.250

16 because it's a commonly used number,



226

00:08:07.250 --> 00:08:09.150

either way we want to change that now to



227

00:08:09.150 --> 00:08:11.700

sixteen which is showing and now when I



228

00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:13.470

go ahead and recreate the constraints



229

00:08:13.470 --> 00:08:15.560

they'll all have a margin of sixteen



230

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:17.820

let's just go ahead and do that they



231

00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:18.690

will just have a bit of a discussion



232

00:08:18.690 --> 00:08:22.470

about what margins are but you can see



233

00:08:22.470 --> 00:08:24.210

as I'm doing this now, the margin is



234

00:08:24.210 --> 00:08:27.240

being set to 16 for each of our



235

00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:30.900

constraints. Alright so there's our four



236

00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:33.780

constraints. Alright so these margins



237

00:08:33.780 --> 00:08:36.420

are important when creating layouts so



238

00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:38.490

what actually are they? Well think of



239

00:08:38.490 --> 00:08:40.620

them as an area around the outside of a



240

00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:42.840

widget just like margins on a sheet of



241

00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.910

paper. Now what we're going to do first



242

00:08:44.910 --> 00:08:46.710

is change the layout width and layout



243

00:08:46.710 --> 00:08:49.650

height on the widget so that it's 200 DP



244

00:08:49.650 --> 00:08:52.560

square. Now we've seen how to resize a



245

00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:54.240

widget by dragging the handles on the



246

00:08:54.240 --> 00:08:56.130

four corners but if you want a specific



247

00:08:56.130 --> 00:08:58.860

size, it's usually easy to just type the



248

00:08:58.860 --> 00:09:00.390

size into the properties pane on the



249

00:09:00.390 --> 00:09:02.400

right below the inspectors and that's



250

00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:04.860

just here, let's change that to make that



251

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:09.000

exactly 200, you can see that the image



252

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.920

changed when I did that the size changed



253

00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:13.410

and same for the layout and that's going



254

00:09:13.410 --> 00:09:14.670

to press tab or something to move away



255

00:09:14.670 --> 00:09:16.650

and you can see that that's changed so



256

00:09:16.650 --> 00:09:18.210

whenever you type any takes effect once



257

00:09:18.210 --> 00:09:20.520

your cursor or once you're once you've



258

00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:23.940

moved outside of that field so the space



259

00:09:23.940 --> 00:09:25.440

that the widget now occupies on the



260

00:09:25.440 --> 00:09:28.830

screen is 232, so the widget itself is



261

00:09:28.830 --> 00:09:31.560

200 and there's an additional 16 on each



262

00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:35.490

side making 232 in total I'm going to



263

00:09:35.490 --> 00:09:38.010

talk about these DP units in a moment or



264

00:09:38.010 --> 00:09:40.080

probably in the next video. Alright so



265

00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:42.030

at this point we're seeing this image as



266

00:09:42.030 --> 00:09:43.830

it would appear on a nexus 4 device



267

00:09:43.830 --> 00:09:47.640

which has a screen width of 768.



268

00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:49.530

Now looking at the blueprint our image is



269

00:09:49.530 --> 00:09:51.300

obviously a lot more than 16 from the



270

00:09:51.300 --> 00:09:53.670

left edge, in fact if you look carefully



271

00:09:53.670 --> 00:09:55.410

you can see the 16 there then there's



272

00:09:55.410 --> 00:09:56.760

all this extra stuff showing in the



273

00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:58.770

middle there so what's actually key



274

00:09:58.770 --> 00:10:01.860

it's centered? Well making sure that the



275

00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:03.779

image view is selected which in my case



276

00:10:03.779 --> 00:10:06.930

it is notice these two sliders in the



277

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:09.810

object inspector your horizontal bias



278

00:10:09.810 --> 00:10:13.380

and reverse I've got a vertical bios now



279

00:10:13.380 --> 00:10:15.720

they represent a bios which is how far



280

00:10:15.720 --> 00:10:18.060

from the top and left of the screen our



281

00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:20.310

widget appears so it's expressed as a



282

00:10:20.310 --> 00:10:22.170

percentage and you can see there that



283

00:10:22.170 --> 00:10:24.630

it's got a number of fifty by default



284

00:10:24.630 --> 00:10:27.480

that means the widget is half way down



285

00:10:27.480 --> 00:10:29.820

and also half way across because they're



286

00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:32.459

both set to fifty now if we drag the



287

00:10:32.459 --> 00:10:35.190

bottom slider to the left when we do



288

00:10:35.190 --> 00:10:37.560

that the bios decreases and notice that



289

00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:41.080

the image is now moving as well



290

00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:42.370

we're moving all the way over to zero



291

00:10:42.370 --> 00:10:45.610

the bias is set to zero and when it's



292

00:10:45.610 --> 00:10:47.860

set to zero the widgets as far left as



293

00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.770

it'll go and now it looks to be about 16



294

00:10:50.770 --> 00:10:52.030

from the edge so in other words the



295

00:10:52.030 --> 00:10:53.920

margin is now only 16 there's no other



296

00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.140

bias moving the image to any other lip



297

00:10:56.140 --> 00:10:58.960

position and if we increase the margin



298

00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.430

on the left-hand constraint by over



299

00:11:00.430 --> 00:11:02.710

typing the value of 16 they'll come over



300

00:11:02.710 --> 00:11:06.490

here I'll just put just clicked on that



301

00:11:06.490 --> 00:11:08.740

you can see that we can specify several



302

00:11:08.740 --> 00:11:10.570

options after 32 for argument's sake



303

00:11:10.570 --> 00:11:12.640

but we do that you can see that the



304

00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:15.220

actual image view moved because we



305

00:11:15.220 --> 00:11:17.410

increased the margin and because my



306

00:11:17.410 --> 00:11:19.840

version of Android studio was sized up



307

00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.180

for video presentation we can actually



308

00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.620

see the numbers too clearly but if I



309

00:11:23.620 --> 00:11:25.630

actually just making sure that my mouse



310

00:11:25.630 --> 00:11:27.970

is being I've clicked into that area if



311

00:11:27.970 --> 00:11:30.010

I type in a much larger number like 120



312

00:11:30.010 --> 00:11:31.630

then press enter



313

00:11:31.630 --> 00:11:33.280

you can see it moves the image right



314

00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:35.200

over and although you can't see the



315

00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.280

whole number you can see if I'm moving



316

00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:39.010

down my left arrow the number 120 is



317

00:11:39.010 --> 00:11:41.530

showing in there so this confirms that



318

00:11:41.530 --> 00:11:43.840

the margins used to create space around



319

00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.450

a widget and forms part of the overall



320

00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:49.750

space occupied by that widget now if we



321

00:11:49.750 --> 00:11:51.940

use the horizontal slider over here to



322

00:11:51.940 --> 00:11:55.300

center the image again. Now you



323

00:11:55.300 --> 00:11:57.220

don't have to be too precise with it or



324

00:11:57.220 --> 00:11:58.450

fight with a mouse because when you get



325

00:11:58.450 --> 00:12:00.760

close to what you want you can actually



326

00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:02.740

fine tune it using the cursor keys you



327

00:12:02.740 --> 00:12:04.270

can see it's set to 45 and I've just



328

00:12:04.270 --> 00:12:07.900

used my cursor key and get it exactly to



329

00:12:07.900 --> 00:12:10.750

50. Now when it's set to 50 the image is



330

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.550

still off to the right but that's



331

00:12:12.550 --> 00:12:14.260

because we've got a wide margin on the



332

00:12:14.260 --> 00:12:16.630

left what's being sent in here though is



333

00:12:16.630 --> 00:12:19.990

the image view plus its margin so if we



334

00:12:19.990 --> 00:12:22.180

change the left margin back to 16 again



335

00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:24.100

we're select it from the drop-down this



336

00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:27.850

time the image is now moved back and



337

00:12:27.850 --> 00:12:30.640

everything says it should be okay so



338

00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:31.960

we're going to come back to constraints



339

00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:34.030

a little bit later by the way in case



340

00:12:34.030 --> 00:12:35.380

you hadn't guessed that's why this is



341

00:12:35.380 --> 00:12:38.020

called the constraint layout now what



342

00:12:38.020 --> 00:12:39.730

I'm going to do is finish this video by



343

00:12:39.730 --> 00:12:41.830

leaving you to experiment with the scale



344

00:12:41.830 --> 00:12:44.350

type property and that's over here in



345

00:12:44.350 --> 00:12:46.360

the properties pane on the right hand



346

00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:47.920

side scale top as you can see there



347

00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:49.570

we've got a number of different options



348

00:12:49.570 --> 00:12:51.730

here. Now by the way this used to be



349

00:12:51.730 --> 00:12:53.530

called the properties pane but Google



350

00:12:53.530 --> 00:12:54.819

have renamed it to attribute



351

00:12:54.819 --> 00:12:56.769

so you can see the name up there now in



352

00:12:56.769 --> 00:12:58.149

this particular version of Android



353

00:12:58.149 --> 00:13:00.429

studio but I did mention the old name



354

00:13:00.429 --> 00:13:02.199

because you may come across guides and



355

00:13:02.199 --> 00:13:03.579

tutorials in the Android documentation



356

00:13:03.579 --> 00:13:06.819

that uses the old term but I'll try to



357

00:13:06.819 --> 00:13:08.379

remember to call it attributes meaning



358

00:13:08.379 --> 00:13:09.549

forward in these videos.



359

00:13:09.549 --> 00:13:12.189

Now before we experiment with the scale



360

00:13:12.189 --> 00:13:14.199

type attribute, we want to change the



361

00:13:14.199 --> 00:13:17.649

layout width and loud height to 384 by



362

00:13:17.649 --> 00:13:19.629

480, so let's go ahead and do that come



363

00:13:19.629 --> 00:13:21.689

up here and I'm going to type 304



364

00:13:21.689 --> 00:13:28.419

pressed into there and 480 and that



365

00:13:28.419 --> 00:13:30.220

causes the image view widget to fill the



366

00:13:30.220 --> 00:13:32.079

screen allowing for the margins perhaps



367

00:13:32.079 --> 00:13:34.419

and the image is probably centered for



368

00:13:34.419 --> 00:13:35.829

you and it certainly is on the screen so



369

00:13:35.829 --> 00:13:38.289

you can see for me now. Now just in case



370

00:13:38.289 --> 00:13:39.910

it isn't though don't worry because that



371

00:13:39.910 --> 00:13:40.989

positioning is what we're going to be



372

00:13:40.989 --> 00:13:42.489

looking at next probably in the next



373

00:13:42.489 --> 00:13:44.739

video but getting back to scale top



374

00:13:44.739 --> 00:13:47.289

before we finish this video if I click



375

00:13:47.289 --> 00:13:49.269

on the drop down there's actually eight



376

00:13:49.269 --> 00:13:51.399

values we can provide for the scale type



377

00:13:51.399 --> 00:13:53.169

and you can see that they're all listed



378

00:13:53.169 --> 00:13:54.689

there what I've clicked on the drop down



379

00:13:54.689 --> 00:13:57.009

so what I'm going to do now is finish



380

00:13:57.009 --> 00:13:59.720

this video with a mini challenge



381

00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:03.080

so yes it's mini-challenge time the idea



382

00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:04.460

of the challenges in this course by the



383

00:14:04.460 --> 00:14:05.870

way is to help you understand a



384

00:14:05.870 --> 00:14:08.210

particular concept a bit better by



385

00:14:08.210 --> 00:14:09.650

getting you to go into Android studio



386

00:14:09.650 --> 00:14:11.210

and trying to solve a particular problem



387

00:14:11.210 --> 00:14:13.640

or challenge. Now we're going to start



388

00:14:13.640 --> 00:14:15.950

off simply but then as we go through the



389

00:14:15.950 --> 00:14:17.630

course will build on the complexity of



390

00:14:17.630 --> 00:14:19.700

these challenges to really challenge you



391

00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.710

and the idea of this is you'll come out



392

00:14:21.710 --> 00:14:23.240

on this course with a better



393

00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:24.920

understanding of Android studio and



394

00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:27.710

Android development so here's the first



395

00:14:27.710 --> 00:14:30.200

challenge. Now just showing you the scale



396

00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:32.750

type that should be it drop down now the



397

00:14:32.750 --> 00:14:34.400

challenge is to experiment with the



398

00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:36.380

eight scale types to work out what they



399

00:14:36.380 --> 00:14:38.420

do you know the one that you don't need



400

00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:40.160

to worry about is metric so if I click



401

00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.990

on that don't worry about metrics for



402

00:14:41.990 --> 00:14:43.520

now because you can't really see what



403

00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:45.470

it's doing in the designer but certainly



404

00:14:45.470 --> 00:14:46.970

try the other ones and when you've done



405

00:14:46.970 --> 00:14:49.280

that check your answers by searching



406

00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:52.790

online for image view scale type. Now if



407

00:14:52.790 --> 00:14:54.170

you search results throw up a



408

00:14:54.170 --> 00:14:56.810

developer.android.com site then that



409

00:14:56.810 --> 00:14:58.250

should be the first one that I check



410

00:14:58.250 --> 00:15:00.260

because that's the site of Google's



411

00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:02.390

documentation and should be considered



412

00:15:02.390 --> 00:15:04.250

the definitive word on anything Android



413

00:15:04.250 --> 00:15:06.590

related. Of course there's no reason that



414

00:15:06.590 --> 00:15:08.150

you can't check other sites too if you



415

00:15:08.150 --> 00:15:10.310

want, so that's the challenge see how you



416

00:15:10.310 --> 00:15:13.070

go experiment with the various settings



417

00:15:13.070 --> 00:15:14.570

the scale type to see what they do



418

00:15:14.570 --> 00:15:18.460

and I'll see you in the next video.
