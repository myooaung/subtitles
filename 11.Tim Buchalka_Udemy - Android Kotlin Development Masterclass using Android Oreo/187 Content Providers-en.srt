1
00:00:05,380 --> 00:00:09,060
So surf I would be a very trivial example of accessing data.

2
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,480
When we opened the database grab the data and then closed it again.

3
00:00:12,830 --> 00:00:17,260
What do we do in a situation of needing more complex data retrieval.

4
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:24,500
Let's go through and look at other ways that we can access data you know apps the Firstly the problem

5
00:00:24,500 --> 00:00:30,500
won't be that we're accessing a database when the user re-orient tights their divorce site from portrait

6
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,350
to landscape.

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:33,990
Well they might press home and access another app.

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,050
Potentially we could have corrupted data because the last software doesn't have any idea about the database

9
00:00:39,230 --> 00:00:42,450
being accessed.

10
00:00:42,520 --> 00:00:48,600
What we can do is we can effectively open our database once and then query all require the data as needed.

11
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,080
In any case the database when the activity is destroyed.

12
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,920
So in other words we want the law to be aware of the database that we can do things like pointing to

13
00:00:56,920 --> 00:00:58,530
a view on the screen for example

14
00:01:01,430 --> 00:01:02,810
you'd also do it manually.

15
00:01:02,890 --> 00:01:07,780
So we can add code to which life cycle event to do the relevant thing for our database.

16
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:12,310
For example close it when the activity is closed etc. and it means that we're adding a lot of code to

17
00:01:12,310 --> 00:01:14,470
each screen you know am by doing it that way.

18
00:01:16,940 --> 00:01:21,300
I see TASC is another white so we could write some code to use these tasks any time we want to access

19
00:01:21,300 --> 00:01:26,380
the database but that ends up being a lot of code.

20
00:01:26,440 --> 00:01:28,570
So that brings us to content provider.

21
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:33,230
Now this is actually a standard way to provide access to a structured set of data.

22
00:01:33,410 --> 00:01:35,390
Sequel that's a good example of this.

23
00:01:35,420 --> 00:01:39,360
So content providers are a cool feature of Android development.

24
00:01:40,800 --> 00:01:46,080
So we set up a content provider you know app and then we can provide a mechanism to return the results

25
00:01:46,080 --> 00:01:47,450
to the coding process.

26
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:49,000
How app or any other app.

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,980
If we choose to share the provide as data.

28
00:01:51,980 --> 00:01:54,390
Now we don't technically need a content provider.

29
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:58,190
If you don't intend to share data but I feel it's better to do it this way.

30
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,570
So your rep has set up the right way in the event that you do decide to share that data in the future.

31
00:02:05,870 --> 00:02:12,170
Now Android provides us with a good list of Buellton content providers for audio video images etc. and

32
00:02:12,170 --> 00:02:14,600
we will work more on those in future videos.

33
00:02:16,820 --> 00:02:22,730
My recommendation is to use a content provider for all your database projects because it has more flexibility

34
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:27,430
and when it comes down to it it's not much if any more complex than other methods.

35
00:02:30,790 --> 00:02:35,570
All right so I think at this point it's now time to put together an app so they can define a content

36
00:02:35,570 --> 00:02:42,470
provider and use a cursor loader to allow us to maintain a context database add context edit and or

37
00:02:42,470 --> 00:02:45,350
delayed existing contacts as well as displaying them.

38
00:02:45,350 --> 00:02:47,560
So let's start work on that in the next video.
