1
00:00:05,100 --> 00:00:10,170
That's the end of the previous video we run the app and we got a security exception because the app

2
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:12,860
didn't have permissions to access the Internet.

3
00:00:12,930 --> 00:00:18,120
Now we had a look at the stack trace and how it's a useful way to work out what went wrong and just

4
00:00:18,120 --> 00:00:18,990
kind of run them up again.

5
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:24,130
Now just to get the same error and we can see the links in there I incurred appeared blue when I do.

6
00:00:24,130 --> 00:00:25,430
That's the stuff that up

7
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,300
case they say we've got to crush them and if we haven't looked at look that we can come over here and

8
00:00:35,300 --> 00:00:38,130
scroll over and we can see Ellingsen blue.

9
00:00:38,570 --> 00:00:44,390
Click on that first thing that takes us to law in 51 and you can see that the error happened when we

10
00:00:44,390 --> 00:00:46,460
tried to do anything with the connection.

11
00:00:46,610 --> 00:00:49,270
In this case even just reading the response card.

12
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,950
So the problem was with the internet connection and the fact that it's a security exception really provides

13
00:00:55,010 --> 00:01:00,700
all the remaining information we need just to confirm that it's a security exception again swap and

14
00:01:00,710 --> 00:01:07,730
have a look Javid land security exception permission to drive and to get a suggestion if a missing Internet

15
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:09,520
permissions perhaps.

16
00:01:09,710 --> 00:01:14,240
Now before we look at fixing the problem which is obviously something we need to do let's catch that

17
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:19,580
exception and make all those error messages a bit tortilla instead of showing the full stack trace.

18
00:01:19,610 --> 00:01:22,540
So we're going to close down the camp for now.

19
00:01:22,850 --> 00:01:30,080
We're going to add another catch here and we're going to put the original exception back again now.

20
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:34,400
But above that I'm going to do is add another catch.

21
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:46,580
For our security it's a catch we call calling security exception and a code block and we're going to

22
00:01:46,580 --> 00:01:51,940
lock a log today I should say Prentice's Tecoma that's going to be download

23
00:01:54,590 --> 00:01:57,790
ex-MIL colon security exception

24
00:02:01,650 --> 00:02:10,030
these permissions that will put a saw and left or right could be Bryce's a message try running them

25
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:10,450
again.

26
00:02:10,460 --> 00:02:14,930
Now that should prevent us from getting that big exception.

27
00:02:15,130 --> 00:02:19,910
Big stack trace Rala publish is to say oh lord.

28
00:02:20,230 --> 00:02:23,460
So now it's no longer crushing that if are going to go cap.

29
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:27,550
You can say you've got a security exception these permission and then you've got the message that's

30
00:02:27,550 --> 00:02:30,530
coming back from the actual exception itself.

31
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:32,970
Permission denied not missing Internet permission.

32
00:02:33,130 --> 00:02:35,770
And then of course with an error downloading as a result.

33
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,430
Yeah well we've got some good errors in the law.

34
00:02:38,490 --> 00:02:43,540
We're going to talk less briefly and show you a bit more about the LOLcat and how you can make it easier

35
00:02:43,540 --> 00:02:51,170
to find information you know to start by clearing the future by clicking on XIV and then you can just

36
00:02:51,170 --> 00:02:55,440
see how busy to look at Kits there's lots of other information there that we've been filtering out.

37
00:02:55,700 --> 00:02:59,780
But we can feel that using the box in the top right of the Android monitor.

38
00:02:59,910 --> 00:03:08,300
And again you've seen this before but if I type in download data there were see messages.

39
00:03:08,320 --> 00:03:12,900
Boy had dandified data class but curiously This is sort of case sensitive.

40
00:03:13,090 --> 00:03:18,400
So if I delete this and I stop the word download with a capital D download

41
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:25,760
to match the tag the page in the log then you have to continue matching the case exactly.

42
00:03:25,820 --> 00:03:30,960
So deadline data will display the entries log for the class patellar day.

43
00:03:31,490 --> 00:03:36,770
So you can say hey I don't need to talk anymore because you can see right away it's not matching anything.

44
00:03:36,770 --> 00:03:44,130
So the best thing to do here is to top all your filters in lower case or download data which then works

45
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:45,930
to the other.

46
00:03:45,940 --> 00:03:52,530
After that it topped download data into the the box where we can see the background starting starts

47
00:03:52,540 --> 00:03:58,060
with and then the link and then you were that received obviously and it also logged in error after the

48
00:03:58,060 --> 00:04:05,260
error from Deadline ex-MIL catching the security exception and finally post execute its logging its

49
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,670
parameter as an empty string which is what I would ask which is what we'd expect if doing background

50
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,180
I gave an error.

51
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:17,990
And again when I delete the contents are cleared by clicking on the x we get heaps of messages again.

52
00:04:18,010 --> 00:04:24,220
Now this would contain far more of a physical device but even an emulator is continually logging all

53
00:04:24,220 --> 00:04:25,320
sorts of stuff.

54
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:33,800
In fact if a change is dropped and here to the right to know filters and scroll up you can see that

55
00:04:33,950 --> 00:04:37,510
there's an absolute load of things that have made Lotti heaps of things.

56
00:04:37,910 --> 00:04:43,630
And you can see there's just pages and pages and pages of stuff they are going to turn up to show only

57
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:45,320
selected applications again.

58
00:04:45,560 --> 00:04:47,090
So application I should say.

59
00:04:47,390 --> 00:04:50,750
So we're just getting stuff that's relevant for us.

60
00:04:50,780 --> 00:04:53,270
There's a selective application it's referred to by the way.

61
00:04:53,480 --> 00:04:58,390
He's the one in the second dropdown from the left this one here which is obviously our our academy Donlin

62
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:01,080
programming up top 10 dead letter.

63
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:06,410
Now Edward device has had quite a few things going on at once so you can actually look at logs for other

64
00:05:06,410 --> 00:05:11,860
applications if you want but it lets you get involved in Android system programming you generally just

65
00:05:11,860 --> 00:05:14,700
want to leave it to display just the entries for your app.

66
00:05:14,780 --> 00:05:19,490
Now if you do want to force tech tries to predict when you've caught an exception you could do that.

67
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:26,180
And I just took it back here back to occurred there close to the location so they could do that by calling

68
00:05:26,180 --> 00:05:28,810
the print stack trace method of the exception.

69
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:32,580
So I got to add that to the catch block for the security exception just to show you.

70
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,120
So we can actually do that before the log.

71
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:36,360
Does it really matter where we do.

72
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:44,450
But we do it before we'll do a dot print stack trace to locate and make sure that I have cleared the

73
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:47,060
filter so it doesn't throw it out most of the spectra.

74
00:05:47,060 --> 00:05:49,710
So basically I'm going to get more data about doing that.

75
00:05:49,820 --> 00:05:52,640
And another by that time to start running it again.

76
00:05:53,060 --> 00:05:56,090
So one of the first is I'll actually clear the filter as well.

77
00:05:56,300 --> 00:05:57,040
OK.

78
00:05:57,430 --> 00:05:58,490
And we'll run them again.

79
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:10,660
And you can say now that we've done that we've printed out quite a bit of stuff there.

80
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:16,460
Basically that's the price that we had before I caught the exception and you can see scrolling up and

81
00:06:16,470 --> 00:06:18,850
it's actually done that now we're into it.

82
00:06:18,850 --> 00:06:20,980
Today it doesn't color the message is red.

83
00:06:20,980 --> 00:06:26,210
That's because they're created deliberately by by our act now rather than by the Java runtime.

84
00:06:26,380 --> 00:06:34,220
But the links in the code rescored have a look to the wrought there's still a different color.

85
00:06:34,350 --> 00:06:40,590
So it has to click on my activity Katie and get to learn 51 and see where the error actually is.

86
00:06:40,590 --> 00:06:45,420
Basically it's the same lot of card the response equals connection response card.

87
00:06:45,450 --> 00:06:50,850
Now something else we can do as I mentioned earlier is future are more than want to and be useful to

88
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:55,350
get some idea of what's happening through main activity and we can do that by filtering for main activity

89
00:06:55,350 --> 00:06:56,640
or download data.

90
00:06:56,640 --> 00:06:59,940
I we have say this before but we'll just briefly share that again.

91
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:04,540
So that's main activity.

92
00:07:04,740 --> 00:07:10,740
You say the use of this pop pool bar character before vertical bar which actually means or can talk

93
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:17,670
Danila dicer and now we're getting information about main activity or download data so the vertical

94
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,260
bombings all basically.

95
00:07:19,740 --> 00:07:23,840
All right so that cleans everything up and we can see uncreate pings started in my activity.

96
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:28,160
I mean he does want us to log entries for the download data class.

97
00:07:28,430 --> 00:07:28,800
OK.

98
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,410
So I'm going to close the account for now and let's talk about permissions.

99
00:07:33,500 --> 00:07:36,970
They are but a photo that has no permissions to anything at all.

100
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:41,280
And that has to get permission from the user to access resources it needs.

101
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,440
And this was usually done with the apps installed.

102
00:07:45,470 --> 00:07:51,260
Now I say was as you can see on the screen there because with Android 6.0 marshmallow Google changed

103
00:07:51,260 --> 00:07:55,730
the way that I that obtained permissions for the resources it needs.

104
00:07:55,910 --> 00:08:01,490
No Prato Android marshmallow user grouted the requested permissions when they install the app.

105
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,490
If I didn't grant all the permissions that the app couldn't be installed once granted the app had all

106
00:08:07,490 --> 00:08:13,430
the requested permissions for its entire lifetime of the device and the only way to revoke any of the

107
00:08:13,430 --> 00:08:16,460
permissions was effectively to install the app.

108
00:08:16,460 --> 00:08:22,700
Now with the above spell the one above and that requests the permissions it needs when it runs and it

109
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:25,370
has to do so each time it does run.

110
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:30,740
Notice the Google documentation states even if the app used the camera yesterday it kind of a shame

111
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:32,560
it still has that permission to live.

112
00:08:32,910 --> 00:08:38,570
Now the documentation isn't as clear as it could be and if you read it in a certain way it could be

113
00:08:38,570 --> 00:08:41,640
implying that Europe has to request the permission from the user.

114
00:08:41,720 --> 00:08:42,720
Each time it runs.

115
00:08:42,950 --> 00:08:44,050
But that isn't the case.

116
00:08:44,050 --> 00:08:50,460
Fortunately once the user has granted permission then your app continues to have that permission and

117
00:08:50,460 --> 00:08:55,640
unless the user specifically revokes it the app still has to request the permission each time.

118
00:08:55,700 --> 00:09:01,390
But the Edwyn system doesn't ask the user every time.

119
00:09:01,400 --> 00:09:05,050
All right so let's have a look at the documentation because apart from that one source of confusion

120
00:09:05,050 --> 00:09:06,460
that's pretty good.

121
00:09:06,590 --> 00:09:12,750
Now Google is separate the documentation into reference guides and Torrijos and the tutorial pages for

122
00:09:12,750 --> 00:09:14,510
permissions explains it all.

123
00:09:14,650 --> 00:09:16,230
I'm going to just put that in a browser.

124
00:09:19,530 --> 00:09:21,440
Post the link for it.

125
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:28,320
Now this first page explains that each app runs in its own sandbox elsewhere the documentation explains

126
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:34,230
how this is achieved which is by creating a new Linux user ID for each app but we don't need to understand

127
00:09:34,230 --> 00:09:36,730
that level of data to work with permissions.

128
00:09:37,020 --> 00:09:43,320
No the killing StarLink down here at the bottom goes into a bit more detail so I that it starts by saying

129
00:09:43,320 --> 00:09:47,570
that the app has to declare the permissions it needs in the app manifest.

130
00:09:47,620 --> 00:09:50,580
We're going to be doing that for the Internet permission in a minute.

131
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:57,480
When the second paragraph is this description of the different behavior for Android versions up to 4.1

132
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:00,190
and for version 6.0 and whole.

133
00:10:00,450 --> 00:10:05,370
Now up to four point one they use it grants permission when they install the app.

134
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:08,600
If they don't grant the permissions then the app doesn't install.

135
00:10:08,970 --> 00:10:14,790
But from 18:26 point zero and above the HUSIC grants permission when they run the app then it's worth

136
00:10:14,790 --> 00:10:18,430
going through this Google tutorial when you come to create your own apps.

137
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:23,790
Here's the recommendations of weight and how you should request permissions when your apps running.

138
00:10:23,810 --> 00:10:25,740
No good we suggest that you don't read.

139
00:10:25,800 --> 00:10:30,090
You don't request all the permissions at once but instead you wait until the user does something that

140
00:10:30,090 --> 00:10:35,120
needs the permission before asking them for it and it makes more sense to the user.

141
00:10:35,130 --> 00:10:40,650
If your app asks them to give them my full permission to access the contacts when I've just tried to

142
00:10:40,650 --> 00:10:43,520
use your app to share file with someone for example.

143
00:10:43,770 --> 00:10:48,900
But if you request that permission to suicide first run your app then they might be left wondering why

144
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:53,280
the app needs to access their contacts at all and that is a very useful link.

145
00:10:53,280 --> 00:11:00,200
At the end of the third paragraph down here which is to take it to the definition of normal and dangerous

146
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:08,160
permissions no permission to access the internet cancels honorable permission and the system will automatically

147
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:09,550
grant that permission.

148
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,600
As long as we declare it in the benefits.

149
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:14,620
But scrolling down slightly.

150
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:20,420
You can say that Tony list here dangerous permissions and permission groups can talk.

151
00:11:20,450 --> 00:11:25,630
Hear about mission groups and yes guys it's a bit more detail about the various types of permissions.

152
00:11:25,620 --> 00:11:27,660
This is dangerous permissions as well.

153
00:11:27,710 --> 00:11:33,760
It's a bit of an overview of what it is and again looking at the table section listing what I've enjoyed

154
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:39,610
talking all of what you suggest are dangerous permissions are going to be looking at had to do with

155
00:11:39,610 --> 00:11:44,440
requesting permissions with no apps running later in the course when we need access to the context and

156
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:45,450
the microphone.

157
00:11:45,820 --> 00:11:50,310
But in this quote up a bit and to the best basically up to the normal permissions script.

158
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:52,780
Noble and dangerous permissions.

159
00:11:52,780 --> 00:11:59,180
There's a link that's a noble permissions so when I click on that if we have it all we can save is code

160
00:11:59,190 --> 00:12:02,990
and internet is defined as a normal permission.

161
00:12:03,180 --> 00:12:08,780
So the good news for this is that we only have to declare that we needed to get permission in the manifest.

162
00:12:08,790 --> 00:12:14,290
They will then work on all Edward versions that were actually targeting suffocate back.

163
00:12:14,310 --> 00:12:20,300
Back now to get George to go to open the Edwardo manifests.

164
00:12:20,380 --> 00:12:26,010
Now if you're working an interview on a suggestion early to do that for the benefit in the manifests

165
00:12:26,010 --> 00:12:27,410
folder under wraps.

166
00:12:27,510 --> 00:12:28,290
I put that up.

167
00:12:28,350 --> 00:12:29,470
You can say that I mean android.

168
00:12:29,470 --> 00:12:31,650
You hear what manifests.

169
00:12:31,650 --> 00:12:36,490
I'm going to click on that and there's no header manifest and ex-American double click on that.

170
00:12:37,610 --> 00:12:39,940
Now don't worry too much about all this stuff in here.

171
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:44,140
We're going to be looking at the application tag later on and explaining what it means.

172
00:12:44,310 --> 00:12:48,910
For now that we need to add an entry to declare that the app uses the Internet.

173
00:12:49,100 --> 00:12:51,330
Now I'm going to make some space at the top here.

174
00:12:51,740 --> 00:12:59,730
Just after the package before the start of the application tag I'm going to stop Torpey the user's text

175
00:12:59,730 --> 00:13:04,300
or less sense on users.

176
00:13:04,380 --> 00:13:09,570
Now I definitely recommend using the code completion chahiye to make sure you don't make any errors

177
00:13:09,570 --> 00:13:10,540
when talking.

178
00:13:10,650 --> 00:13:15,300
If you get the case wrong you won't see an error in here but the app won't work because the permission

179
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:16,390
must be granted.

180
00:13:16,690 --> 00:13:22,260
Now one uses Desch permission to go into TEB to my Arrakis to get into that.

181
00:13:22,350 --> 00:13:26,490
Then I'm going to present terracotta clicked on it to select it and notice that when I've done that

182
00:13:26,570 --> 00:13:28,960
we automatically got this pop up.

183
00:13:29,010 --> 00:13:33,810
I prefer to use the Cherokee Eric is to select the one I want and that's because I don't like switching

184
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:38,880
from the cable to best but it's your choice as to which one you want and all the available permissions

185
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:41,860
are showing and you can say here I can select the one I want.

186
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:44,400
And again these publishers are case sensitive.

187
00:13:44,400 --> 00:13:49,920
So once again I recommend that you select them from the list rather than tossing them in and you can

188
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:56,340
filter the list as well so a topping cam for example say you could see the Android permission doc Kemmerer

189
00:13:56,340 --> 00:14:00,580
is showing in the list but I don't want that once I want to delete cab top.

190
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:06,060
I Argentine's did and you could say we've got some the other ones that have got the letters.

191
00:14:06,090 --> 00:14:10,060
I them them can see that there's the Internet permission there.

192
00:14:10,090 --> 00:14:11,100
Once again he's dead.

193
00:14:11,100 --> 00:14:15,740
OK I get Precentor and he can say that's it for us.

194
00:14:15,750 --> 00:14:20,960
And I just need to close the tag with the forged Slessor and click on the fourth slash that closes and

195
00:14:20,970 --> 00:14:27,060
adds the last bit of the tag and that's the Internet permission declared in the manifest.

196
00:14:27,060 --> 00:14:32,460
Now this time the app should run without any errors so let's run it and have a look at the look at what

197
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:32,760
we're doing.

198
00:14:32,760 --> 00:14:38,690
Well I put up the log at first it will run it will just clear the log log cat which I've mentioned before

199
00:14:38,690 --> 00:14:40,010
is a good habit to get into.

200
00:14:40,170 --> 00:14:43,340
Even though I had George Judaea tends to do that for us at the moment.

201
00:14:44,570 --> 00:14:46,240
Right I can say this to.

202
00:14:46,550 --> 00:14:48,570
We have got an era anymore.

203
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:52,320
If you scroll back up to the top you can see the run at the top.

204
00:14:52,340 --> 00:14:56,160
We've got to download ex-Beatle the response card was hundred.

205
00:14:56,540 --> 00:14:57,640
So that's looking good.

206
00:14:57,780 --> 00:15:02,020
And that means that it responds better to her is OK.

207
00:15:02,330 --> 00:15:06,670
If your internet connection goes through a proxy then you might get two or three response instead.

208
00:15:06,680 --> 00:15:08,080
But that's also fine.

209
00:15:08,660 --> 00:15:13,290
And we can see the example you probably saw that scrolling up and that's the Exham are printed by the

210
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:14,480
umpires to execute method.

211
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,140
So at the definitely working fine.

212
00:15:17,240 --> 00:15:22,730
One thing to be aware of is that there's a limit to how much a log entry can be so you won't necessarily

213
00:15:22,730 --> 00:15:25,020
see all the examples in the locker.

214
00:15:25,100 --> 00:15:31,200
If it hadn't all downloaded had been an error so it looks it looks like everything is falling apart.

215
00:15:31,230 --> 00:15:32,130
Have a look.

216
00:15:32,140 --> 00:15:34,090
You say it seems you just chop it off.

217
00:15:34,280 --> 00:15:37,210
But again that's due to the limit of luck kat.

218
00:15:37,340 --> 00:15:41,730
And if we saw the error there was an error downloading we would have got some form of error and we haven't

219
00:15:41,750 --> 00:15:43,080
in this case.

220
00:15:43,550 --> 00:15:50,550
And we all had logged in number of Bauch was safe to say here is say 6 1 6 0 1 box which is about 6

221
00:15:50,890 --> 00:15:54,680
6 came close to 7 quyte showing in the log so that's good.

222
00:15:54,710 --> 00:15:58,490
So obviously it's not all been logged but it has been downloaded.

223
00:15:58,790 --> 00:16:02,200
Yep otherwise we can see what happens when things don't work properly.

224
00:16:02,210 --> 00:16:07,100
It's very simple to do we just change the U around to something invalid so we close the benefits for

225
00:16:07,100 --> 00:16:11,090
now and don't just get back up to the top of that fall just.

226
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:12,460
Perhaps have another letter.

227
00:16:12,890 --> 00:16:19,130
So this makes this add a very this to make them invalid so if we run that again they'll

228
00:16:24,250 --> 00:16:27,240
And you can say we get a completely different era here and I will resolve.

229
00:16:27,340 --> 00:16:32,210
I very extraordinary is that people will come and we get a traditional IRA.

230
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:37,700
So basically it's an exception that's being LUGG then we know that because it's no exception reading

231
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:44,240
data which was the message that we talked in when we specified the catch block for the IO exception

232
00:16:44,930 --> 00:16:47,320
you could say here it's reading data.

233
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:53,180
Now the extra bit of the error message self-describe and have a look and able to resolve Hirst's obviously

234
00:16:53,180 --> 00:16:58,460
that's not something that's come from us that's come from this 8. message property either here to the

235
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:03,530
right hand side and that's been printed out and basically we're updating that to the log tree no exceptions

236
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:08,990
include various bits of information and the message is a useful thing to log because it provides more

237
00:17:08,990 --> 00:17:13,970
information on what may have caused the error or what sort of tested that old street exceptions are

238
00:17:13,970 --> 00:17:14,710
caught.

239
00:17:14,930 --> 00:17:16,900
But there's one thing more to do.

240
00:17:17,120 --> 00:17:22,400
First they were put fixed line 23 could do that.

241
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:26,610
So we're left with now a valid yourself again.

242
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:31,110
They're going to do is turn off the internet connection in the simulator.

243
00:17:31,690 --> 00:17:33,940
So we're going to just print the image on the screen.

244
00:17:34,530 --> 00:17:39,670
Or that's what I'm going to do now is turn off the internet connection in the light to now unlock a

245
00:17:39,670 --> 00:17:40,270
root of all.

246
00:17:40,290 --> 00:17:43,040
Well you could just stop the watch fired by both data.

247
00:17:43,150 --> 00:17:45,690
You can't actually do that on some emulators.

248
00:17:45,700 --> 00:17:51,370
What we can do is turn on airplane mode which prevents the simulator from accessing the network you

249
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:52,750
know just like a physical device.

250
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:54,650
You can drag the top of the screen down.

251
00:17:54,910 --> 00:18:00,190
Let's do that here to see the couple of options but we can also go into settings if we want and turn

252
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:02,310
on airplane mode there.

253
00:18:02,560 --> 00:18:11,880
So click on that if you want to we could do a search for a plane select that I'm going to turn airplane

254
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:16,220
mode on and so you get the oxygen at the top of the screen here.

255
00:18:16,500 --> 00:18:17,610
There will be another step.

256
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,020
Wasfi is off.

257
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:22,350
That's because the is using the computer's network connection.

258
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,920
Instead what it does it sees it as a mobile data connection.

259
00:18:25,920 --> 00:18:28,990
Now what about data has an orchid on the Follette.

260
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:35,630
We go back to where we were there was I just closed it down because it abdicated.

261
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:41,500
And we can see over here this is the option for my Botella collection.

262
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:45,980
You click on that or click it up already applied by another click it off in any event and want to leave

263
00:18:46,510 --> 00:18:51,890
it on for now and come back here and run again I going to kill the cat just to get into the habit of

264
00:18:51,890 --> 00:18:53,440
doing that.

265
00:18:53,480 --> 00:18:57,290
Let's see what happens with a mode on my boat.

266
00:18:57,300 --> 00:18:58,130
I have turned off

267
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:04,310
and you can see what the IRA are no exception.

268
00:19:04,310 --> 00:19:07,220
Reading tatter and able to resolve for highest.

269
00:19:07,290 --> 00:19:12,740
So what that system do with the heisted cup he resolved even with a valid euro.

270
00:19:12,930 --> 00:19:19,570
Now strangely Occasionally you will find this emulate Aboo work when you sit a plane might that happened

271
00:19:19,570 --> 00:19:20,720
to just stop the EP and rerun it.

272
00:19:20,720 --> 00:19:23,400
I presume it's some sort of bug perhaps with we'll see you later.

273
00:19:23,460 --> 00:19:25,050
But in that case you can say that it worked here.

274
00:19:25,050 --> 00:19:25,820
OK.

275
00:19:26,190 --> 00:19:31,630
So that's how tantalizing the example for the RSS feed Doubleday's before we change anything.

276
00:19:31,630 --> 00:19:38,100
It's just turn a planned mode off and click on to make sure that my boat out of condition is activated

277
00:19:38,620 --> 00:19:43,140
and we just cut back and just run the one more time just to make sure that it's not working again.

278
00:19:47,110 --> 00:19:51,510
And he can say we know we're getting data in the lock at the bottom so we could to go.

279
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:57,050
All right so that's the app but downloading the ex-MIL for the RSS feed in the next video we can change

280
00:19:57,140 --> 00:20:00,750
oldest kind of brought it into much more content in like manner.

281
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:02,320
So see you in the next video.
