00:00:04.730 --> 00:00:06.979

In this video we're going to make some



2

00:00:06.979 --> 00:00:08.809

configuration changes to Android studio



3

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.059

and also install a few extra options



4

00:00:11.059 --> 00:00:13.160

that are useful, so you want to start by



5

00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.440

launching Android studio and once it's



6

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:16.580

started you want to come down here and



7

00:00:16.580 --> 00:00:18.860

click on the configure menu at the



8

00:00:18.860 --> 00:00:20.960

bottom of the welcome screen. Now we have



9

00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:22.730

to launch something called the SDK



10

00:00:22.730 --> 00:00:25.009

manager. Now this is where you find the



11

00:00:25.009 --> 00:00:27.559

various components of Android studio to



12

00:00:27.559 --> 00:00:31.130

choose this top option SDK manager and



13

00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:33.230

then when it starts to I will quickly



14

00:00:33.230 --> 00:00:36.320

download a list of the latest updates



15

00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:38.300

you can see it here doing that so I'll



16

00:00:38.300 --> 00:00:40.160

give that a moment to complete. Now the



17

00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.140

good news is that this Windows resizable



18

00:00:42.140 --> 00:00:44.030

even though the icons don't show on



19

00:00:44.030 --> 00:00:45.890

Windows, so you can resize it instead of



20

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:47.960

looking at the various packages in a



21

00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.120

small list box, so I'm going to expand



22

00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:51.680

this a little bit and then sighs it up



23

00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:53.270

so that they can be easily seen in the



24

00:00:53.270 --> 00:00:56.780

video. Okay so at the top of the window



25

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.780

you can see your path to the SDK up here



26

00:00:59.780 --> 00:01:01.430

the software development kit.



27

00:01:01.430 --> 00:01:04.339

Now the SDK is all the classes that make



28

00:01:04.339 --> 00:01:06.259

up Android as well as things like the



29

00:01:06.259 --> 00:01:09.049

emulators and a few other tools now one



30

00:01:09.049 --> 00:01:10.939

problem you can get is if you've



31

00:01:10.939 --> 00:01:13.069

installed your SDK in a location that



32

00:01:13.069 --> 00:01:15.740

contains spaces in its path.



33

00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:17.450

Now this can happen on Windows in



34

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:19.850

particular Windows allows spaces in user



35

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.249

names so your home directory could end



36

00:01:22.249 --> 00:01:24.319

up being something like C colon



37

00:01:24.319 --> 00:01:27.590

backslash users backslash Tim space



38

00:01:27.590 --> 00:01:30.079

Buchalka. Now it's not a good idea to use



39

00:01:30.079 --> 00:01:32.450

spaces in the name of objects including



40

00:01:32.450 --> 00:01:33.920

directories and user names but two



41

00:01:33.920 --> 00:01:36.020

windows does allow it. Now if there is a



42

00:01:36.020 --> 00:01:38.479

space somewhere in your SDK path then



43

00:01:38.479 --> 00:01:39.709

you won't actually be able to make any



44

00:01:39.709 --> 00:01:41.689

changes on the screen, everything will be



45

00:01:41.689 --> 00:01:43.549

disabled.N ow this doesn't just affect



46

00:01:43.549 --> 00:01:46.039

Android studio you'll also get problems



47

00:01:46.039 --> 00:01:47.689

with other programs if your home



48

00:01:47.689 --> 00:01:50.569

directory contains a space so to proceed



49

00:01:50.569 --> 00:01:52.399

in that event you'll need to move your



50

00:01:52.399 --> 00:01:55.069

SDK folder to a different location so



51

00:01:55.069 --> 00:01:57.529

that there's no spaces in its path now



52

00:01:57.529 --> 00:01:59.359

use your operating systems File Manager



53

00:01:59.359 --> 00:02:02.179

program to copy the SDK directory to



54

00:02:02.179 --> 00:02:05.029

another location in that scenario so on



55

00:02:05.029 --> 00:02:06.799

Windows and remember that this is



56

00:02:06.799 --> 00:02:08.509

generally only a problem on Windows



57

00:02:08.509 --> 00:02:10.640

systems you could just copy the Android



58

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:12.769

directory to backslash users backslash



59

00:02:12.769 --> 00:02:15.319

public now you'll have full permission



60

00:02:15.319 --> 00:02:18.110

to public so there'd be no problems moving



61

00:02:18.110 --> 00:02:20.300

there but you can put it anywhere that



62

00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:22.250

you have permission to write to just



63

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:24.050

make sure that there are no spaces in



64

00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:26.210

the path. Alright so this is the



65

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:29.330

Android SDK manager and from here we can



66

00:02:29.330 --> 00:02:31.580

install some additional features and we



67

00:02:31.580 --> 00:02:33.500

can also update some components if



68

00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:35.870

updates are available now on this say



69

00:02:35.870 --> 00:02:38.510

SDK platforms tab, you can see the



70

00:02:38.510 --> 00:02:40.010

versions of Android that have been



71

00:02:40.010 --> 00:02:45.470

released for API 27 all the way to API level 7



72

00:02:45.470 --> 00:02:56.470

which was Android 2.1.



73

00:02:56.470 --> 00:02:59.090

Now there's really no need to install



74

00:02:59.090 --> 00:03:00.890

most of the previous Android versions



75

00:03:00.890 --> 00:03:03.020

and I certainly don't suggest you try to



76

00:03:03.020 --> 00:03:05.300

install all of them the latest Android



77

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.970

SDK platform does actually allow you to



78

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.770

create apps that will run or that will



79

00:03:09.770 --> 00:03:12.410

run on earlier versions of Android so



80

00:03:12.410 --> 00:03:14.150

you don't need the other versions to



81

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:16.370

create your apps. Now the other thing to



82

00:03:16.370 --> 00:03:18.980

be aware of is that your SDK directory



83

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.140

can get very big if you install a lot of



84

00:03:21.140 --> 00:03:23.630

options, 4 gigabytes is very easy



85

00:03:23.630 --> 00:03:25.820

to get to and that's without everything



86

00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:28.130

installed, so if you want a bit mad here



87

00:03:28.130 --> 00:03:31.010

you could use up an awful amount of disk



88

00:03:31.010 --> 00:03:33.380

space, however if you want to preview



89

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.750

layouts in earlier Android versions then



90

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:37.430

you'll need to install the Android SDK



91

00:03:37.430 --> 00:03:40.250

platform option for that version.



92

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.959

Now that probably won't make much sense at



93

00:03:41.959 --> 00:03:43.610

the moment but we'll do later in the



94

00:03:43.610 --> 00:03:45.350

course now there's quite a few options



95

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.840

here on the screen but it looks far



96

00:03:47.840 --> 00:03:50.000

worse than it is the various components



97

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.470

are pretty much the same for every



98

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:53.480

Android version, so that we can



99

00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:55.549

concentrate on the two latest versions



100

00:03:55.549 --> 00:03:58.910

at the top Android 8 Oreo then Android



101

00:03:58.910 --> 00:04:02.450

API 27. Now it's always worth checking



102

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.220

the one version before the latest



103

00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.620

because sometimes Google don't make



104

00:04:06.620 --> 00:04:07.940

everything available in the latest



105

00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:11.030

version right away it can be a delay.



106

00:04:11.030 --> 00:04:13.190

Now one example of this is the sources for



107

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.920

android 26 as you can see here now



108

00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:19.100

Google released API 27-point after



109

00:04:19.100 --> 00:04:21.109

version 8 and didn't make the sources



110

00:04:21.109 --> 00:04:23.570

available right away and as at the time



111

00:04:23.570 --> 00:04:25.400

I'm recording this there's no sources



112

00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.190

for Android 27 available, so if you spot



113

00:04:28.190 --> 00:04:30.349

something in the previous version that's



114

00:04:30.349 --> 00:04:32.030

not available in the latest one



115

00:04:32.030 --> 00:04:33.710

then install the earlier version of that



116

00:04:33.710 --> 00:04:36.470

component now what we're going to do is



117

00:04:36.470 --> 00:04:38.300

we're going to install the Android API



118

00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:41.210

27, now depending on your installation



119

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:42.530

you might find that's already been



120

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.750

installed and in my case you can see



121

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.180

here that Android SDK platform 27 has



122

00:04:47.180 --> 00:04:49.430

been installed but we're also going to



123

00:04:49.430 --> 00:04:51.800

choose these two options here Google API



124

00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.370

is until x86 atom system image and the



125

00:04:55.370 --> 00:04:58.460

Google Play version of that as well so



126

00:04:58.460 --> 00:04:59.570

basically you want to make sure that



127

00:04:59.570 --> 00:05:02.180

those three options are ticked now we



128

00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:04.090

don't want the Android TV system image



129

00:05:04.090 --> 00:05:05.720

because we're not going to cover



130

00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:08.480

developing for TVs in this course. Now if



131

00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.210

you unticked something it'll be uninstalled.



132

00:05:11.210 --> 00:05:12.950

Now once you've been using Android



133

00:05:12.950 --> 00:05:14.930

studio for a while and you've received a



134

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:16.940

number of updates you may want to remove



135

00:05:16.940 --> 00:05:19.430

older versions of some components to do



136

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.740

that you just untick the box next to the



137

00:05:21.740 --> 00:05:23.450

component and then click the apply



138

00:05:23.450 --> 00:05:25.400

button now we don't want to remove



139

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.050

anything at this stage so make sure you



140

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.610

don't take anything that's already



141

00:05:28.610 --> 00:05:30.530

installed I mean it's not the other the



142

00:05:30.530 --> 00:05:31.820

world if you do that you can just come



143

00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.950

back to the screen later and install it



144

00:05:33.950 --> 00:05:35.900

again if you do that so at the moment



145

00:05:35.900 --> 00:05:37.550

we're also going to need the Android SDK



146

00:05:37.550 --> 00:05:40.100

platform 26 we need to make sure that's



147

00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:41.840

checked as well, so I'm going to click on



148

00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.210

this option here and I'm going to



149

00:05:44.210 --> 00:05:45.830

mention that again briefly in a moment.



150

00:05:45.830 --> 00:05:47.990

Now if you've ticked anything that



151

00:05:47.990 --> 00:05:50.000

wasn't already installed you can click



152

00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:52.160

apply to install it and you can then



153

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:53.570

then confirm the installation and the



154

00:05:53.570 --> 00:05:54.920

components will be downloaded and



155

00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.170

installed, so what I'll do is I'll stop



156

00:05:57.170 --> 00:06:01.850

that process now click on ok, there's a



157

00:06:01.850 --> 00:06:04.250

short update I'll short delay while



158

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:06.140

Google's updating we've got this screen



159

00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:07.690

here now we can click on accept and



160

00:06:07.690 --> 00:06:10.150

select the separate option down here



161

00:06:10.150 --> 00:06:14.330

accept click on next a Google now is



162

00:06:14.330 --> 00:06:16.640

downloading the components here so I'm



163

00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:18.310

just going to move this over to one side



164

00:06:18.310 --> 00:06:20.810

so that we can still talk while that's



165

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.650

actually happening now the next option



166

00:06:24.650 --> 00:06:26.230

that are we going to want to install



167

00:06:26.230 --> 00:06:29.720

will be the sources for Android API 27.



168

00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.120

Now that's the source code for Android



169

00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.280

and it's very useful when you're using



170

00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:37.070

the various components in your code now



171

00:06:37.070 --> 00:06:38.210

you can go in and have a look at the



172

00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:40.040

code from our drawing and get ideas on



173

00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.090

how it all works



174

00:06:41.090 --> 00:06:43.280

but unfortunately as you can see in this



175

00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:45.860

option here there's no sources option for



176

00:06:45.860 --> 00:06:49.100

Android 27 at this point in time that's



177

00:06:49.100 --> 00:06:50.600

because the Google haven't released them



178

00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:53.630

yet so we can see the api's 26 sources



179

00:06:53.630 --> 00:06:55.880

out of the Android oreo heading this one



180

00:06:55.880 --> 00:06:58.730

shall hear so what's this installation



181

00:06:58.730 --> 00:07:00.140

is finished on the right-hand side we're



182

00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:01.400

going to have to go ahead and try and



183

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:03.290

install that and incidentally in case



184

00:07:03.290 --> 00:07:04.640

you're wondering the Android SDK



185

00:07:04.640 --> 00:07:07.460

platform that we've selected that's



186

00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:09.650

basically Android and we definitely need



187

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.390

that and as I said you really only need



188

00:07:11.390 --> 00:07:13.520

to install the latest version but we're



189

00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.070

actually installing the other version as well.



190

00:07:15.070 --> 00:07:17.090

Alright so on that once that other



191

00:07:17.090 --> 00:07:18.350

installation is completed we're gonna



192

00:07:18.350 --> 00:07:19.940

come back here and install sources for



193

00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:22.580

Android 26 because Android studio will



194

00:07:22.580 --> 00:07:24.440

only attempt to jump into the latest



195

00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.480

version of the source code which means



196

00:07:26.480 --> 00:07:28.670

it's going to look for the API 27



197

00:07:28.670 --> 00:07:31.190

sources when you have APR 27 as your



198

00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:33.920

compile SDK version and we'll talk more



199

00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:36.020

about that in future videos but I'm



200

00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.440

going to install the API 26 sources because Android



201

00:07:39.440 --> 00:07:42.500

studio is currently setting API 26 as the target



202

00:07:42.500 --> 00:08:59.180

version even though API 27 is available,



203

00:08:59.180 --> 00:09:01.700

a load of phones for testing on. Now we



204

00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:02.930

don't need to install all of them though



205

00:09:02.930 --> 00:09:05.540

the first few of developing four TVs in



206

00:09:05.540 --> 00:09:08.210

Android wear, watches in the like I'm



207

00:09:08.210 --> 00:09:09.890

talking about so this one here Android



208

00:09:09.890 --> 00:09:13.460

wear Intel an Android TV Intel and they



209

00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:16.040

may well become available for API 27 in



210

00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:17.780

the future, as well but we won't be



211

00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.270

covering TV and we're in this course so



212

00:09:20.270 --> 00:09:21.890

consequently there's no need to install



213

00:09:21.890 --> 00:09:24.170

those emulators but we do want to



214

00:09:24.170 --> 00:09:26.420

install both of the Google Intel x86



215

00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:28.790

atom system images so I'm going to



216

00:09:28.790 --> 00:09:31.340

select the Google API s Intel x86 and



217

00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:34.520

the google play until x86 from the



218

00:09:34.520 --> 00:09:37.790

Android 8 SDK you're going to be talking



219

00:09:37.790 --> 00:09:40.250

more about these a bit later the reason



220

00:09:40.250 --> 00:09:41.720

that there's no two different system



221

00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:43.880

images is that Google have included



222

00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:46.250

access to the Google Play Store on the



223

00:09:46.250 --> 00:09:48.620

Google Play images and what that means



224

00:09:48.620 --> 00:09:49.970

is that you can install apps from the



225

00:09:49.970 --> 00:09:52.250

Play Store on the emulator you couldn't



226

00:09:52.250 --> 00:09:53.690

do that in previous versions of Android



227

00:09:53.690 --> 00:09:56.120

studio or Android. Now there is a



228

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.890

downside though and the Google Play



229

00:09:57.890 --> 00:09:59.930

image restricts access just like a



230

00:09:59.930 --> 00:10:02.210

physical Android device, so there are a



231

00:10:02.210 --> 00:10:03.770

few things you can't do with the Google



232

00:10:03.770 --> 00:10:05.690

Play images and that's why we also need



233

00:10:05.690 --> 00:10:08.480

the Google API image as well now we will



234

00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.130

be looking at that later in the course



235

00:10:10.130 --> 00:10:12.200

when we have a look at the Android file



236

00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:14.180

system. Alright so let's quickly



237

00:10:14.180 --> 00:10:16.280

download the sources for Android 26,



238

00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:20.680

I'm gonna click apply click ok



239

00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:22.579

so what I'm going to do is while that



240

00:10:22.579 --> 00:10:24.260

down is downloading I'm going to finish



241

00:10:24.260 --> 00:10:26.329

the video here and we'll continue on



242

00:10:26.329 --> 00:10:27.920

with a configuration of Android studio



243

00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:30.730

in that video.
