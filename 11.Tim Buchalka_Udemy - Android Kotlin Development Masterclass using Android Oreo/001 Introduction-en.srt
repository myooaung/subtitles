Welcome to the Master Android 8

2
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:10,400
software development course with Kotlin.

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:11,870
So my name is Tim Buchalka, as you can see on

4
00:00:11,870 --> 00:00:13,610
the screen there and my co-instructor is

5
00:00:13,610 --> 00:00:15,710
Jean Paul Roberts. So we'd like to start

6
00:00:15,710 --> 00:00:17,119
out by thanking you for investing in

7
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:18,800
this course and just to let you know,

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:20,900
that this is our goal to get you up to

9
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:23,000
speed as an Android developer in the

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,070
quickest possible time. Now this

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,200
course is a companion to our master

12
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,630
Android development course with Java and

13
00:00:29,630 --> 00:00:31,610
covers pretty much the same topics but

14
00:00:31,610 --> 00:00:34,430
it uses Kotlin rather than Java.

15
00:00:34,430 --> 00:00:36,020
Now Google have made Kotlin the first-class

16
00:00:36,020 --> 00:00:38,300
language for Android development it is

17
00:00:38,300 --> 00:00:39,920
possible to use other languages such as

18
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:42,170
Python for example but at the moment

19
00:00:42,170 --> 00:00:44,329
only Java and Kotlin and natively

20
00:00:44,329 --> 00:00:46,910
supported by the Android runtime. Now I

21
00:00:46,910 --> 00:00:48,500
know that you're probably itchy to get

22
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:50,210
started with the programming but there's

23
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:51,710
just a few things that we need to go

24
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:54,019
through first and I promise that I'll

25
00:00:54,019 --> 00:00:55,940
keep this as brief as I possibly can.

26
00:00:55,940 --> 00:00:58,460
Now there's over 25 hours of content in

27
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:00,289
the course right now and we plan to

28
00:01:00,289 --> 00:01:02,359
continue adding in content until Google

29
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:03,649
releases the next version of Android

30
00:01:03,649 --> 00:01:06,560
Android P whatever that was to add for

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:08,869
there are Java version of this course is

32
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:11,030
already over 50 hours of content and

33
00:01:11,030 --> 00:01:13,070
this course is probably the largest and

34
00:01:13,070 --> 00:01:15,229
most comprehensive Android course out

35
00:01:15,229 --> 00:01:16,820
there and it's just gonna get bigger

36
00:01:16,820 --> 00:01:18,350
and better so stay tuned for that

37
00:01:18,350 --> 00:01:20,360
knowing that the course will continually

38
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:22,520
get updated. Now if you find a problem

39
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:24,290
with a video somewhere please let myself

40
00:01:24,290 --> 00:01:26,479
or Jean Paul know and that's because we

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:27,560
really want to give you the best

42
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:29,869
possible Android training and even there

43
00:01:29,869 --> 00:01:31,640
between us we've got a collective 60

44
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:33,229
plus years of software development

45
00:01:33,229 --> 00:01:35,689
experience, we are here in and we do make

46
00:01:35,689 --> 00:01:39,079
mistakes very occasionally, seriously

47
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:40,759
though let us know if you do find

48
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:41,930
something wrong with the video and we'll

49
00:01:41,930 --> 00:01:43,490
endeavor to put it right as soon as

50
00:01:43,490 --> 00:01:46,310
possible and finally I advise the best way

51
00:01:46,310 --> 00:01:48,560
to use this course is just dive in and

52
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:50,359
get started. So what are you waiting for?

53
00:01:50,359 --> 00:01:54,399
I'll see you in the next video.
