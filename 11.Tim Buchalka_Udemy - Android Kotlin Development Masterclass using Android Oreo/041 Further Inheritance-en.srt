1
00:00:04,980 --> 00:00:06,629
In this video we're going to look at

2
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:08,940
extending the vampire class to create a

3
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,280
super vampire. Now it's going to be very

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:13,530
similar to what we've already done but

5
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:14,790
there's a couple of other things we need

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:16,830
to know how to do so we're going to

7
00:00:16,830 --> 00:00:19,050
create a vampire King subclass of the

8
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:22,169
Empire now a vampire king is going to be

9
00:00:22,169 --> 00:00:24,059
incredibly powerful and any points of

10
00:00:24,059 --> 00:00:26,550
damage inflicted will be divided by for

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,800
event parking objects we'll also start

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:30,630
off with a hundred and forty hit points

13
00:00:30,630 --> 00:00:32,610
and as you see that's what we need to

14
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:34,050
look a bit deeper into Kotlin

15
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:36,660
inheritance so going to start by

16
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:38,490
extending vampire to create a vampire

17
00:00:38,490 --> 00:00:39,870
king class with those additional

18
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:42,720
properties first thing we need to do is

19
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:45,500
start by making the vampire class open

20
00:00:45,500 --> 00:00:49,500
so let's do that so that it can be now

21
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,420
inherited from and then we need to

22
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,400
create our new vampire king class so I'm

23
00:00:53,400 --> 00:00:56,220
going to do that right click Java fold a

24
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:59,280
new cotton class save a bit of top top

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,770
in my selecting class and the name of

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,619
your vampire king now we need to pass

27
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,389
the name to the class and provide that

28
00:01:09,389 --> 00:01:12,509
to the vampire class so at the end of

29
00:01:12,509 --> 00:01:14,909
the definition add parentheses name

30
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:18,539
colon string then outside the right

31
00:01:18,539 --> 00:01:22,709
parenthesis colon vampire and in

32
00:01:22,709 --> 00:01:26,159
parentheses name that's straightforward

33
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,819
but where it gets tricky is setting the

34
00:01:29,819 --> 00:01:33,450
vampire kings hit points to 140 now if

35
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:36,270
we look at the vampire class it passes

36
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:38,670
the fixed value 20 to the enemy

37
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:40,829
constructor now we need to change that

38
00:01:40,829 --> 00:01:43,859
to 140 somehow now one way we could do

39
00:01:43,859 --> 00:01:46,709
that is to use a default value and we

40
00:01:46,709 --> 00:01:48,479
can modify the vampire class to have a

41
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:50,789
hitpoints parameter with a default value

42
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,340
of 20 that we can then pass to the enemy

43
00:01:53,340 --> 00:01:56,490
constructor so let's try that first so

44
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:01,499
we'll add the parameter hit points it

45
00:02:01,499 --> 00:02:04,289
points colon int then set the default

46
00:02:04,289 --> 00:02:06,959
value of 20 then we need to change the

47
00:02:06,959 --> 00:02:12,150
hard-coded value here to hit points so

48
00:02:12,150 --> 00:02:13,709
now that we've done that we can go back

49
00:02:13,709 --> 00:02:15,959
to the vampire constructor in the

50
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:18,590
vampire king class

51
00:02:18,590 --> 00:02:24,270
and we can change that to 140 so let's

52
00:02:24,270 --> 00:02:26,430
see if that works before we talk some

53
00:02:26,430 --> 00:02:28,560
more about it so I'm gonna go back to

54
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:29,640
our main function

55
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:32,940
and let's add or create a vampire King

56
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:39,200
instance so Val Dracula is equal to

57
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,670
vampire king parentheses Dracula and

58
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:46,050
let's put the value of that as well so

59
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,130
print 'ln Dracula so let's run that and

60
00:02:50,130 --> 00:02:56,340
see if it works okay so that's good we

61
00:02:56,340 --> 00:02:59,010
can see that it does work Dracula as you

62
00:02:59,010 --> 00:03:00,780
can see down the bottom here has got 140

63
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,209
hit points so that's one way to do it

64
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:05,340
and it's a perfectly acceptable solution

65
00:03:05,340 --> 00:03:07,050
but you can probably tell that I'm

66
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,940
itching to show you another way. So

67
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:10,470
what's wrong with what we've just done

68
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:13,650
well it's compromised our vampire class

69
00:03:13,650 --> 00:03:15,989
slightly because we can now create

70
00:03:15,989 --> 00:03:18,209
vampire instances with less than 20 hit

71
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:20,580
points so if we go and modify the code

72
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:24,209
on line 8 that creates Vlad we can use

73
00:03:24,209 --> 00:03:26,220
that second argument now and say set the

74
00:03:26,220 --> 00:03:28,590
hit points to two now before I run the

75
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:30,810
program again notice in the output that

76
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:32,640
Vlad started off with 20 hit points and

77
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,130
they drop to 16 after we inflicted the

78
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:40,769
damage but if we run it again now what's

79
00:03:40,769 --> 00:03:42,120
happened this time is because he only

80
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:44,040
started out with 2 hit points poorer

81
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:46,500
Vlad's lost her life with the damage

82
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:48,959
that's been inflicted on him now the

83
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,480
change we made to the vampire class now

84
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:53,220
allows the vampires to be created with a

85
00:03:53,220 --> 00:03:55,500
different number of hit points and that

86
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:56,730
may be fine depending on your

87
00:03:56,730 --> 00:03:58,830
application sometimes though you'll want

88
00:03:58,830 --> 00:04:01,080
to provide a default but allow the users

89
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:03,239
of your class to change it sometimes

90
00:04:03,239 --> 00:04:05,130
though it'll be very important that some

91
00:04:05,130 --> 00:04:07,200
properties can't be altered in this way

92
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:09,780
you know it's an example consider an art

93
00:04:09,780 --> 00:04:11,970
class that draws an arc through a

94
00:04:11,970 --> 00:04:14,579
specified number of degrees now we may

95
00:04:14,579 --> 00:04:16,680
override this to create a circle class

96
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:18,479
which will have the number of degrees

97
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:21,299
fixed at 360 now we certainly don't want

98
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:23,220
to draw circles that don't have 360

99
00:04:23,220 --> 00:04:24,840
degrees because of course they wouldn't

100
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:27,660
be circles so getting back to our code

101
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:29,430
though we can define our enemy objects

102
00:04:29,430 --> 00:04:30,870
to be whatever we want

103
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,669
there are inventions if you like but

104
00:04:32,669 --> 00:04:34,320
when we're modeling real physical

105
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,480
objects we want our classes to really

106
00:04:36,480 --> 00:04:38,400
respect those physical constraints and

107
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:40,740
that's why sometimes this approach won't

108
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:43,320
be appropriate and another important

109
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:44,970
reason is that we might be extending

110
00:04:44,970 --> 00:04:47,130
someone else's class and if we don't

111
00:04:47,130 --> 00:04:49,229
have the source code available then we

112
00:04:49,229 --> 00:04:51,180
can't make changes to it and that would

113
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:53,699
rule out this approach so what I'm going

114
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,830
to do is undo these changes and

115
00:04:55,830 --> 00:04:58,020
command-c is a very useful shortcut it

116
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:00,720
undoes the last change you made and a PC

117
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:01,650
that's controls it

118
00:05:01,650 --> 00:05:03,630
so rather than editing my changes I'm

119
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:06,180
going to use control Z to undo them so

120
00:05:06,180 --> 00:05:07,830
firstly in main I'm going to undo the

121
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,220
changes to bled to get rid of the extra

122
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,110
line there that was passing the number

123
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:15,389
of hit points and back in the vampire

124
00:05:15,389 --> 00:05:17,760
class that's undo those changes as well

125
00:05:17,760 --> 00:05:22,350
will remove hit points in the default

126
00:05:22,350 --> 00:05:24,479
value as well and that will mean that

127
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:25,800
when we go back to the vampire king

128
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,389
class of course we have no kind of error

129
00:05:27,389 --> 00:05:29,850
because we're using the hundred and 40

130
00:05:29,850 --> 00:05:31,830
so I'm going to undo that as well so we

131
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,169
had a pact to how we had it before so

132
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:35,760
how can we now set the hit points for

133
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:39,720
our vampire King to hunt to 140 what we

134
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:42,090
can do instead is to use it in an init

135
00:05:42,090 --> 00:05:44,669
block in vampire king to change the hit

136
00:05:44,669 --> 00:05:48,860
points value so we can type in in it

137
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:51,419
then left or right curly braces and

138
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:54,300
within like the code block we can assign

139
00:05:54,300 --> 00:05:56,849
hit points equal to 140 now what that

140
00:05:56,849 --> 00:05:59,070
does is changes the value of hit points

141
00:05:59,070 --> 00:06:02,400
whether an object gets created now in it

142
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,190
codes executed at the time that we

143
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:06,960
create the instance and it's done

144
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:08,760
automatically so we don't have to

145
00:06:08,760 --> 00:06:11,099
remember to do anything special so if we

146
00:06:11,099 --> 00:06:12,349
run this program given that we've

147
00:06:12,349 --> 00:06:18,930
deleted those changes we can see that

148
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:21,060
Dracula is now still dedicating his hit

149
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,430
points set to 140 but we haven't

150
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:26,660
compromised the vampire class in any way

151
00:06:26,660 --> 00:06:28,620
basically we've extended the vampire

152
00:06:28,620 --> 00:06:30,570
class and changed the hit point for our

153
00:06:30,570 --> 00:06:32,729
vampire king without having to modify

154
00:06:32,729 --> 00:06:35,789
the vampire king's sleeper class all

155
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:37,260
right so all that remains now is to

156
00:06:37,260 --> 00:06:39,719
override the take damage function to

157
00:06:39,719 --> 00:06:42,270
divide the damage by four now if you

158
00:06:42,270 --> 00:06:43,740
recall already done something similar

159
00:06:43,740 --> 00:06:46,129
with a vampire

160
00:06:46,129 --> 00:06:48,389
use the tape damage so let's do

161
00:06:48,389 --> 00:06:50,909
something similar here we have vampire

162
00:06:50,909 --> 00:06:57,089
king class over I'd take damage and what

163
00:06:57,089 --> 00:07:00,360
I'm going to do is set that damage and

164
00:07:00,360 --> 00:07:03,749
we'll divide it by two there remembering

165
00:07:03,749 --> 00:07:05,460
that we're trying to overall change the

166
00:07:05,460 --> 00:07:08,189
damage by 4 divide the total damage

167
00:07:08,189 --> 00:07:11,159
taken by 4 and in fact that's exactly

168
00:07:11,159 --> 00:07:13,259
the same code now that we've got into

169
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:15,270
the vampire class that's the if you

170
00:07:15,270 --> 00:07:17,819
recall that vampire class well that's

171
00:07:17,819 --> 00:07:19,710
already setting the damage of dividing

172
00:07:19,710 --> 00:07:21,689
that damage by 2 and we're doing the

173
00:07:21,689 --> 00:07:23,460
same thing here and take damage for the

174
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:25,830
vampire king class so we ready dividing

175
00:07:25,830 --> 00:07:29,520
it again by 2 here and not by 4 so it is

176
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,039
important to understand exactly which

177
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:34,889
class is the superclass here no vampire

178
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:37,800
king extends vampire so the super method

179
00:07:37,800 --> 00:07:39,659
of recording is the vampire method and

180
00:07:39,659 --> 00:07:42,360
not the enemy method so what happens is

181
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:44,279
that the vampire king take damage method

182
00:07:44,279 --> 00:07:46,740
calls the method in its superclass which

183
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:49,560
is vampire now the vampire class take

184
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:51,509
damage method then calls its superclass

185
00:07:51,509 --> 00:07:53,909
method or function so that it calls the

186
00:07:53,909 --> 00:07:57,120
enemy take damage function now Android

187
00:07:57,120 --> 00:07:59,610
studio has a really useful feature to

188
00:07:59,610 --> 00:08:01,889
help understand all this so back in the

189
00:08:01,889 --> 00:08:03,749
vampire king class which I've got open I

190
00:08:03,749 --> 00:08:06,419
could hold down the command key on a Mac

191
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:09,209
and control on a PC and click only take

192
00:08:09,209 --> 00:08:12,089
damage in this call to super take damage

193
00:08:12,089 --> 00:08:15,629
and I click on that you can see there's

194
00:08:15,629 --> 00:08:17,490
automatically jumped to the vampire

195
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,009
class or rather they take damage

196
00:08:20,009 --> 00:08:22,770
function in the vampire superclass and

197
00:08:22,770 --> 00:08:26,639
if I do that again in this class you can

198
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,709
see it's now jumped to the take damage

199
00:08:28,709 --> 00:08:31,949
function in the enemy class so basically

200
00:08:31,949 --> 00:08:35,099
that's the superclass of vampire so you

201
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,079
can follow the trail back and that's

202
00:08:37,079 --> 00:08:39,300
great for checking exactly what these

203
00:08:39,300 --> 00:08:42,389
overridden functions are doing ok so we

204
00:08:42,389 --> 00:08:44,279
only have to divide the damage by 2 in

205
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,100
their vampire King class again and

206
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,630
that's because it'll be divided again

207
00:08:48,630 --> 00:08:50,940
when the vampire take damage methods

208
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:52,470
called so in other words when this code

209
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:54,060
is executed which has also got the

210
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:56,910
divider by 2 so let's see if it works by

211
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:58,640
inflicting some damage on Dracula in the

212
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:04,580
main function, so to a Dracula dot take

213
00:09:04,580 --> 00:09:14,300
damage 12 you'll run that so when we

214
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:15,350
round the program you can see that

215
00:09:15,350 --> 00:09:17,780
Dracula starts off with 140 hit points

216
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:19,610
we've been inflicted 12 points of damage

217
00:09:19,610 --> 00:09:22,010
but that gets divided by 2 in the

218
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:24,530
vampire king take damage method then

219
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:26,390
divided by 2 again in the vampire class

220
00:09:26,390 --> 00:09:28,010
so we only divide when he inflict a

221
00:09:28,010 --> 00:09:30,290
total of three hit points of damage on Dracula

222
00:09:30,290 --> 00:09:33,590
so Dracula ends up with 137 hit points

223
00:09:33,590 --> 00:09:37,420
left 3 points of damage which is correct.

224
00:09:37,420 --> 00:09:39,260
Alright so I'm going to stop the video

225
00:09:39,260 --> 00:09:40,940
here and in the next one we're going to

226
00:09:40,940 --> 00:09:42,860
look at using loops to repeat a section

227
00:09:42,860 --> 00:09:44,480
of code we're actually going to use a

228
00:09:44,480 --> 00:09:46,400
loop to repeatedly inflict damage on

229
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,770
Dracula so that hopefully we can slay

230
00:09:48,770 --> 00:09:52,630
that prude, see you in the next video.
