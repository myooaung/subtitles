00:00:04.590 --> 00:00:06.660

Okay, so we're back at Android studio



2

00:00:06.660 --> 00:00:08.370

let's have a closer look now at this



3

00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:10.620

view inspector, so click on the image



4

00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:12.420

view if it's not clicked and we've got



5

00:00:12.420 --> 00:00:15.090

the view inspector. Now inside the



6

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.520

inspector are four lines inside the



7

00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:19.890

square here and they're used to set how



8

00:00:19.890 --> 00:00:22.949

the width and height are interpreted.



9

00:00:22.949 --> 00:00:24.960

Now google refer to these as the inner lines



10

00:00:24.960 --> 00:00:26.999

within a widget. Now at the moment



11

00:00:26.999 --> 00:00:29.369

they're both using the values that we've



12

00:00:29.369 --> 00:00:32.250

specified in the lab width and layout



13

00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:35.610

height boxes this is the 200 by 200 DP,



14

00:00:35.610 --> 00:00:38.670

so that's actually called fixed but if I



15

00:00:38.670 --> 00:00:39.990

come up here and I actually click on one



16

00:00:39.990 --> 00:00:41.940

of these we can change them to match



17

00:00:41.940 --> 00:00:44.970

constraints, I'll click on that now and



18

00:00:44.970 --> 00:00:46.590

you can see that we had a change with



19

00:00:46.590 --> 00:00:48.750

the image view on-screen and also the



20

00:00:48.750 --> 00:00:50.850

markers changed to a sort of spiky graph



21

00:00:50.850 --> 00:00:53.220

a bit like the electronics symbol for a



22

00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:56.780

resistor. Now if we click it again now



23

00:00:56.780 --> 00:00:59.100

you can see that's down here now in the



24

00:00:59.100 --> 00:01:00.780

last width that's changed that to wrap



25

00:01:00.780 --> 00:01:03.300

content and the markers change to



26

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.570

Chevron's and notice how fit start and



27

00:01:06.570 --> 00:01:09.119

fit in work when the horizontal width is



28

00:01:09.119 --> 00:01:10.950

set to wrap content and the layout



29

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:14.520

height is set to 200 DP, the vertical and



30

00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.399

horizontal lines change independently so



31

00:01:17.399 --> 00:01:19.740

what do they all mean? Well at the moment



32

00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:20.850

we're working with an image that's



33

00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:22.619

actually bigger than the device screen,



34

00:01:22.619 --> 00:01:26.159

the image is 640 by 480 and our screen



35

00:01:26.159 --> 00:01:27.149

isn't that wide.



36

00:01:27.149 --> 00:01:29.130

Now please trust me on that for a moment



37

00:01:29.130 --> 00:01:31.649

it probably doesn't make sense because



38

00:01:31.649 --> 00:01:35.130

our Nexus 4 has a width of 768 but I'll



39

00:01:35.130 --> 00:01:38.280

be explaining that shortly to prove



40

00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:39.630

though that it's wider than the screen



41

00:01:39.630 --> 00:01:41.460

we're going to click the vertical and



42

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:43.560

horizontal analyze into the layout width



43

00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.600

and layout height change to wrap content



44

00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.009

so you can see that I've got wrap



45

00:01:47.009 --> 00:01:48.780

content for my layout width I'm going to



46

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:51.359

do the same for the layout height bill



47

00:01:51.359 --> 00:01:53.249

clicking on it once and then clicking on



48

00:01:53.249 --> 00:01:55.679

it again you can see we've got no rap



49

00:01:55.679 --> 00:01:57.179

content although we can't quite see that



50

00:01:57.179 --> 00:01:58.829

in the boxes it's been set for both the



51

00:01:58.829 --> 00:02:01.560

layout width and layout height the other



52

00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:02.609

thing you want to do now is come over



53

00:02:02.609 --> 00:02:04.529

here a scout type and make sure that's



54

00:02:04.529 --> 00:02:08.550

now set to fix XY. So now that I've done



55

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:10.350

that the image has to be compressed



56

00:02:10.350 --> 00:02:12.900

horizontally so we've got that rugby



57

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.629

ball or AFL football which means it must



58

00:02:15.629 --> 00:02:18.380

have been wider than the available space



59

00:02:18.380 --> 00:02:20.570

now even changing the left margin to



60

00:02:20.570 --> 00:02:22.370

zero doesn't help so if I try doing that



61

00:02:22.370 --> 00:02:25.940

to zero we've still got this issue here



62

00:02:25.940 --> 00:02:28.040

where clearly it's not fitting and I'll



63

00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:32.570

just change it back to 16 so ignore the



64

00:02:32.570 --> 00:02:34.670

numbers for now and trust your eyes the



65

00:02:34.670 --> 00:02:36.800

image itself is definitely wider than



66

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:39.440

the screen now it's easy to understand



67

00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.240

what these inner lion settings are doing



68

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:43.310

that we've been working with if we use a



69

00:02:43.310 --> 00:02:45.560

smaller image so I'm going to change the



70

00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.990

image views source attribute which is



71

00:02:47.990 --> 00:02:50.750

abbreviated to SRC. Now because we're



72

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:53.120

using the app compat library to make our



73

00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.670

app compatible with older devices the



74

00:02:55.670 --> 00:02:57.320

attribute down here is called source



75

00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.620

compat SRC compat and it's one of the



76

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:02.330

most commonly used properties that



77

00:03:02.330 --> 00:03:04.820

appears in the right-hand pane by the



78

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.370

way this pane is dynamic so if you



79

00:03:07.370 --> 00:03:09.140

happen to antique the compatibility



80

00:03:09.140 --> 00:03:11.870

option when creating the project it



81

00:03:11.870 --> 00:03:13.700

would actually be labelled SRC rather



82

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:17.030

than SRC compat but unless you've got a



83

00:03:17.030 --> 00:03:18.950

really good reason for example you're



84

00:03:18.950 --> 00:03:20.960

producing a corporate app targeting a



85

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:22.760

specific version of android that a



86

00:03:22.760 --> 00:03:24.410

company is settled on then you should



87

00:03:24.410 --> 00:03:26.480

really use the app compat library and



88

00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:28.250

you should be seeing source compat in



89

00:03:28.250 --> 00:03:30.020

the properties pane as showing on the



90

00:03:30.020 --> 00:03:32.390

screen here now so what I'm going to do



91

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.790

is use the smaller ball image the ball



92

00:03:34.790 --> 00:03:37.490

notice for 100 by 100 so that we can get



93

00:03:37.490 --> 00:03:39.680

a better feel for how this works now I



94

00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:41.450

could just come over here and go into



95

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.600

that box and you can see the name of the



96

00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.970

current images ball underscore 640 by



97

00:03:46.970 --> 00:03:49.640

480 so I could just change and type that



98

00:03:49.640 --> 00:03:52.130

in and that would certainly work but if



99

00:03:52.130 --> 00:03:53.150

I come over here and click on the



100

00:03:53.150 --> 00:03:56.270

ellipsis over here click on that we get



101

00:03:56.270 --> 00:03:58.340

the resources dialog and I can select



102

00:03:58.340 --> 00:03:59.990

the image I want from there so that's



103

00:03:59.990 --> 00:04:02.030

actually a lot easier it removes the



104

00:04:02.030 --> 00:04:03.920

risk of typing the name incorrectly so



105

00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:06.080

I'm going to select ball underscore 100



106

00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.070

by 100 and click OK the other thing I'm



107

00:04:10.070 --> 00:04:12.380

going to do is change the layout width



108

00:04:12.380 --> 00:04:14.690

and height back to 200 DPS let's go into



109

00:04:14.690 --> 00:04:19.010

there 200 DP and I'm just pressing tab



110

00:04:19.010 --> 00:04:22.760

now 200 DP press ENTER there now notice



111

00:04:22.760 --> 00:04:24.290

that there are the settings and the



112

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:26.810

inner lines are linked when we click the



113

00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.370

in Alliance the layout width and layout



114

00:04:28.370 --> 00:04:30.560

height settings change and also in this



115

00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:32.270

case when we typed a value



116

00:04:32.270 --> 00:04:33.770

or chose one of the settings for the



117

00:04:33.770 --> 00:04:35.569

width and height then the inner lines



118

00:04:35.569 --> 00:04:37.490

also changed to reflect the new settings



119

00:04:37.490 --> 00:04:38.900

so in other words we're back to a fixed



120

00:04:38.900 --> 00:04:41.120

setting here now so at this point we've



121

00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:43.930

now got a 200 by 200 image view



122

00:04:43.930 --> 00:04:47.229

containing a 100 by 100 image of a ball



123

00:04:47.229 --> 00:04:49.490

now by the way I've given the ball up



124

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:51.919

green background so you can easily tell



125

00:04:51.919 --> 00:04:53.270

when the image is smaller than its



126

00:04:53.270 --> 00:04:55.789

container the image view and I chose a



127

00:04:55.789 --> 00:04:57.440

ball not because I'm mad about soccer



128

00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:59.599

but because it's easy to see when the



129

00:04:59.599 --> 00:05:01.310

image gets skewed when it's resized



130

00:05:01.310 --> 00:05:03.470

which means that the aspect ratio isn't



131

00:05:03.470 --> 00:05:04.430

being maintained



132

00:05:04.430 --> 00:05:06.919

now if to get a more visual idea of what



133

00:05:06.919 --> 00:05:08.270

happens when I change the inter lines



134

00:05:08.270 --> 00:05:10.430

you want to make sure that the scale



135

00:05:10.430 --> 00:05:13.220

type is set to fit X Y which I've



136

00:05:13.220 --> 00:05:15.500

already set here so at the moment we're



137

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:17.840

using a fixed width and height so the



138

00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:19.490

values for the layout width and layout



139

00:05:19.490 --> 00:05:21.830

height are being used and the current



140

00:05:21.830 --> 00:05:25.070

size of the image view is 200 by 200 but



141

00:05:25.070 --> 00:05:26.960

if we change the layout width to match



142

00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.400

our constraints by clicking the



143

00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:31.419

horizontal inner lines I've done there



144

00:05:31.419 --> 00:05:34.340

you can see that the widgets now



145

00:05:34.340 --> 00:05:36.139

expanded to fill the screen left to



146

00:05:36.139 --> 00:05:38.810

right now if you designed android lamps



147

00:05:38.810 --> 00:05:40.880

before by the way this may look the same



148

00:05:40.880 --> 00:05:42.979

as match parent but it's actually



149

00:05:42.979 --> 00:05:44.900

slightly different because it considers



150

00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.030

the constraints now if you're new to



151

00:05:47.030 --> 00:05:49.280

Android layouts match parent as a way of



152

00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.800

sizing a widget so that it fits all the



153

00:05:51.800 --> 00:05:54.500

available space in its parent its parent



154

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.969

being the layout that's been placed into



155

00:05:55.969 --> 00:05:58.580

now match constraints looks exactly the



156

00:05:58.580 --> 00:06:01.039

same as Maps parent here it's causing



157

00:06:01.039 --> 00:06:03.139

the widget to expand to fill the width



158

00:06:03.139 --> 00:06:04.940

of the screen allowing for the



159

00:06:04.940 --> 00:06:07.370

left-to-right margins and you'll see



160

00:06:07.370 --> 00:06:09.020

slightly different behavior once we have



161

00:06:09.020 --> 00:06:11.210

some more widgets on the screen now if I



162

00:06:11.210 --> 00:06:13.090

come over here and click on the



163

00:06:13.090 --> 00:06:15.139

horizontal inner lines again it's gonna



164

00:06:15.139 --> 00:06:17.560

change it to wrap content so let's do that



165

00:06:17.560 --> 00:06:20.000

this makes the widget become as wide as



166

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.680

it needs to be to fit whatever it



167

00:06:21.680 --> 00:06:24.469

contains. Now because we're using a 100



168

00:06:24.469 --> 00:06:27.380

by 100 image the image view is now 100



169

00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.770

DB wide because we chose fit X Y is the



170

00:06:30.770 --> 00:06:32.630

scale type the image is scaled



171

00:06:32.630 --> 00:06:35.240

vertically to fit the fixed height of



172

00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:38.719

the image view which is still 200 DP so



173

00:06:38.719 --> 00:06:40.250

therefore the football becomes sort of



174

00:06:40.250 --> 00:06:42.830

like a rugby ball or a or football or



175

00:06:42.830 --> 00:06:44.419

Easter Egg if chocolate is more your



176

00:06:44.419 --> 00:06:45.919

thing and rugby



177

00:06:45.919 --> 00:06:47.389

so I'm just going to do the same thing



178

00:06:47.389 --> 00:06:49.340

here with the vertical sizes then I'm



179

00:06:49.340 --> 00:06:50.900

going to explain about those strange



180

00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:53.689

units the 100 DP and the 200 DP so I'm



181

00:06:53.689 --> 00:06:54.889

going to click on that to get to wrap



182

00:06:54.889 --> 00:06:59.419

content you can see that initially it



183

00:06:59.419 --> 00:07:01.460

changed it to match constraints and the



184

00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:03.050

imageview got stretched to fit the heart



185

00:07:03.050 --> 00:07:05.180

of the layout I'll just do that again so



186

00:07:05.180 --> 00:07:06.830

we can go back and see what I did so I



187

00:07:06.830 --> 00:07:09.400

clicked that once and you can see that



188

00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:11.900

the imagery stretched to fit the height



189

00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.249

of the layout and it looks a bit



190

00:07:13.249 --> 00:07:15.919

frightening rather than a rugby ball or



191

00:07:15.919 --> 00:07:19.990

chocolate egg by clicking it again



192

00:07:19.990 --> 00:07:22.250

changing changed the layout height to



193

00:07:22.250 --> 00:07:24.319

wrap content and we get an image view



194

00:07:24.319 --> 00:07:26.419

now that's 100 by 100 to match the image



195

00:07:26.419 --> 00:07:29.449

that it contains so the image view is



196

00:07:29.449 --> 00:07:31.550

basically at this point now sized both



197

00:07:31.550 --> 00:07:33.919

vertically and horizontally to match its



198

00:07:33.919 --> 00:07:36.590

contents which of course were 100 by 100



199

00:07:36.590 --> 00:07:39.529

image now there's still a lot to look at



200

00:07:39.529 --> 00:07:41.270

in this designer and if you are used to



201

00:07:41.270 --> 00:07:42.860

using the older layouts that were



202

00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:44.990

available you're probably getting pretty



203

00:07:44.990 --> 00:07:46.490

excited about the way that this



204

00:07:46.490 --> 00:07:49.460

constraint layout works but before I go



205

00:07:49.460 --> 00:07:51.319

on to the really exciting stuff where we



206

00:07:51.319 --> 00:07:53.089

constrain widgets to other widgets I



207

00:07:53.089 --> 00:07:55.000

should probably explain what these



208

00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:57.650

device-independent pixels or DP units



209

00:07:57.650 --> 00:08:01.399

that were using her now our image is 100



210

00:08:01.399 --> 00:08:05.149

pixels wide by 100 pixels high and the



211

00:08:05.149 --> 00:08:06.800

previous image we used was a more usual



212

00:08:06.800 --> 00:08:10.819

640 pixels wide by 480 pixels high



213

00:08:10.819 --> 00:08:14.479

now 640 by 480 is a common size because



214

00:08:14.479 --> 00:08:16.969

and he may not believe this that was the



215

00:08:16.969 --> 00:08:18.949

resolution of early computer screens



216

00:08:18.949 --> 00:08:20.960

I can still distinctly remember how



217

00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:23.810

excited I was when I got my first 1024



218

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:27.740

by 768 monitor the aspect ratio was one



219

00:08:27.740 --> 00:08:29.509

on the third so the screen height was



220

00:08:29.509 --> 00:08:33.260

3/4 of its width now the current trend



221

00:08:33.260 --> 00:08:35.719

is 4 screens to be much wider so we now



222

00:08:35.719 --> 00:08:38.120

tend to have resolutions of 1280 by 720



223

00:08:38.120 --> 00:08:42.560

or HD screens of 1920 by 1080 giving an



224

00:08:42.560 --> 00:08:45.529

aspect ratio of about 1.8 but that's



225

00:08:45.529 --> 00:08:47.690

computer screens though and mobile



226

00:08:47.690 --> 00:08:49.760

phones are generally the other way around



227

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.100

so computer screens are in landscape and



228

00:08:52.100 --> 00:08:54.260

mobile phones well they're in portrait



229

00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:56.149

no different screens have different



230

00:08:56.149 --> 00:08:58.160

resolutions as well and



231

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.410

model screens are managed managing to



232

00:09:00.410 --> 00:09:02.209

pack in far more pixels per inch than



233

00:09:02.209 --> 00:09:04.670

was previously possible so this is the



234

00:09:04.670 --> 00:09:07.639

pixel density so if you've specified



235

00:09:07.639 --> 00:09:10.190

dimensions in pixels your image may look



236

00:09:10.190 --> 00:09:12.440

okay on one device but may look a bit



237

00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:14.300

grim on something with a different pixel



238

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:16.279

density the number of pixels per inch



239

00:09:16.279 --> 00:09:18.769

varies from one device to another and



240

00:09:18.769 --> 00:09:20.810

that can result in our ball appearing in



241

00:09:20.810 --> 00:09:23.329

different sizes relative to the size of



242

00:09:23.329 --> 00:09:25.610

the screen. Now we're going to use the



243

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.589

Android studio layout designer to make



244

00:09:27.589 --> 00:09:29.029

it easy to see how things look on



245

00:09:29.029 --> 00:09:30.980

different devices we're going to start



246

00:09:30.980 --> 00:09:34.240

on that in the next video.
