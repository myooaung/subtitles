00:00:04.760 --> 00:00:06.529

In this section, you're going to get your



2

00:00:06.529 --> 00:00:08.809

very first Android app up and running.



3

00:00:08.809 --> 00:00:11.000

And as well as creating a project and



4

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.039

seeing how it all works, we're going to



5

00:00:13.039 --> 00:00:14.780

get running on an Android virtual device



6

00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:17.930

also known as an AVD and we'll be



7

00:00:17.930 --> 00:00:20.300

looking at how to use an emulator to



8

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:22.910

test your apps as well. In addition, we're



9

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:24.529

going to go through the steps to get set



10

00:00:24.529 --> 00:00:26.630

up and working on a real physical



11

00:00:26.630 --> 00:00:29.179

Android device, before that though we're



12

00:00:29.179 --> 00:00:31.009

going to start by explaining the Android



13

00:00:31.009 --> 00:00:33.860

studio templates in the next video and



14

00:00:33.860 --> 00:00:35.000

let's say you'll understand what the



15

00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:36.920

templates do for you and why it's not



16

00:00:36.920 --> 00:00:38.149

the end of the world if you choose the



17

00:00:38.149 --> 00:00:41.860

wrong one. So let's make a start.
