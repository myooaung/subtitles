1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,569
I mentioned towards the end of the last

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,059
video that the Android jenea can also

3
00:00:09,059 --> 00:00:11,790
compare entire directory trees as well

4
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:13,710
as comparing individual files

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:15,870
now if the directories don't have the

6
00:00:15,870 --> 00:00:17,940
same structure though you will struggle

7
00:00:17,940 --> 00:00:19,590
to getting any year meaningful

8
00:00:19,590 --> 00:00:21,570
comparison from it and that's why I

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:24,060
suggested or have suggested that you use

10
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:26,430
the same company - main as me when

11
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:27,779
you're creating the projects for this

12
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:30,029
course you know to see why they should

13
00:00:30,029 --> 00:00:32,579
match when I click on the activity that

14
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:35,280
main dive XML in the project pane we can

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:37,559
see the path to the file with the

16
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:39,840
project at the top up here here you can

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,170
see that it's a p-- slash sauce / main /

18
00:00:43,170 --> 00:00:46,469
res / layout so if we want to compare

19
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:48,899
resources in two different projects we

20
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:50,129
can actually just compare the res folder

21
00:00:50,129 --> 00:00:53,460
and everything will work fine now I've

22
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:56,039
made a copy of this project earlier so

23
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:57,890
I'm going to click on the res folder

24
00:00:57,890 --> 00:01:00,359
here and then I'm going to use to

25
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:06,420
compare with from the View menu so this

26
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:07,860
time we get something different

27
00:01:07,860 --> 00:01:09,840
it's a directory picker rather than the

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:12,240
file picker so I can navigate to the res

29
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:13,830
folder from the other project so we'll

30
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:18,240
go ahead and do that and I've got this

31
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,580
on my desktop and the calculator app

32
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:26,250
source main and res they know that I've

33
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:27,720
selected that two directories and click

34
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,590
on open so you can see that the Android

35
00:01:31,590 --> 00:01:33,540
studio dev tool displays the directory

36
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:35,159
structure at the top of the screen for

37
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:37,049
both on the left hand side and on the

38
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,479
right hand side and the two same panes

39
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:42,299
comparing the currently selected file in

40
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:45,030
the bottom pane now you may just get a

41
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:46,740
message that or a screen that I've got

42
00:01:46,740 --> 00:01:49,320
saying nothing to show because the diff

43
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:51,630
tools only showing differences so if

44
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,130
that happens both directories are the

45
00:01:53,130 --> 00:01:55,409
same as mine is here because I've taken

46
00:01:55,409 --> 00:01:57,270
a copy of the project that's it existed

47
00:01:57,270 --> 00:01:59,729
at the end of the last video now you can

48
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,070
show all the files if you want to by

49
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:04,880
clicking on the equals button up here

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,590
you can see that that's popped up that

51
00:02:07,590 --> 00:02:09,270
will show files that are the same as

52
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:11,550
well as ones that are different now it

53
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,260
doesn't bother displaying empty

54
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,100
directory

55
00:02:14,100 --> 00:02:15,720
so there's not really much else to see

56
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:18,120
here but if the projects contained other

57
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:20,280
resources you'd be available that'd be

58
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,800
available for comparing as well and once

59
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:24,780
again it can be a good idea to use the

60
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,920
COG menu in the lower pane down here to

61
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:30,270
turn off code inspections in the

62
00:02:30,270 --> 00:02:33,120
highlighting level menu choosing syntax

63
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,420
instead just makes it a bit easy in

64
00:02:36,420 --> 00:02:38,820
terms of all the red all right so I'm

65
00:02:38,820 --> 00:02:39,930
going to close this to get back to

66
00:02:39,930 --> 00:02:42,600
Android studio and then I'm gonna try

67
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,190
and do the same thing but this time for

68
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:46,920
the Java folder up here Java directory

69
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,190
now when I click on view you can see

70
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:52,830
there's now no compared to option now

71
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:54,510
it's tempting to try comparing the app

72
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,220
directory instead so going up one level

73
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:58,800
here and indeed to pick up to view

74
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,900
compared with has got an option to do

75
00:03:00,900 --> 00:03:03,990
that but I definitely advise against it

76
00:03:03,990 --> 00:03:05,790
the reason is that there are a lot of

77
00:03:05,790 --> 00:03:08,070
files in the build directories over 2000

78
00:03:08,070 --> 00:03:09,690
actually and we're not interested in

79
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:11,790
comparing any of them so you'll just end

80
00:03:11,790 --> 00:03:14,040
up with a very confusing display instead

81
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:16,790
I suggest you actually compare it at

82
00:03:16,790 --> 00:03:18,930
package level so in this case the

83
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:20,850
Academy don't learn programming

84
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:23,670
calculator now that's a bit boring but I

85
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:25,050
will do it anyway so I'll click on that

86
00:03:25,050 --> 00:03:29,220
and click on View compared with then go

87
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:32,520
to the same level project in the copy

88
00:03:32,520 --> 00:03:34,739
that I've expanded on my computer so I

89
00:03:34,739 --> 00:03:40,700
calculate then it'll be app source main

90
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:45,540
Java and I'm going to do Academy so

91
00:03:45,540 --> 00:03:47,220
basically at that level and if you're

92
00:03:47,220 --> 00:03:48,750
wondering which were which part that I'm

93
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:50,670
actually testing you can always see that

94
00:03:50,670 --> 00:03:52,140
from with a path that you're actually in

95
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:53,340
so I'm going to go to learn programming

96
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,570
and to calculator you click on open and

97
00:03:57,570 --> 00:03:59,910
then I can click on equals if I want to

98
00:03:59,910 --> 00:04:01,380
see all the files whether there's the

99
00:04:01,380 --> 00:04:03,480
same or different and in this particular

100
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,920
case it's a bit boring because you've

101
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:07,260
only got the one file but that would be

102
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:09,420
a good way of doing it but instead what

103
00:04:09,420 --> 00:04:12,300
I'll do is I'll close this down and I'm

104
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:13,680
going to go into project view up here

105
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:16,230
select project and actually going to do

106
00:04:16,230 --> 00:04:18,780
a comparison from the app source main

107
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:20,209
instead so I'm going to open an app

108
00:04:20,209 --> 00:04:23,010
source and then main I'm going to select

109
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:26,970
that view compare with then I'm going to

110
00:04:26,970 --> 00:04:27,750
go to my other

111
00:04:27,750 --> 00:04:30,450
version and select main as well so we're

112
00:04:30,450 --> 00:04:32,550
basically in this at the same level you

113
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:35,460
can't open and you can see we're in apps

114
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,060
or main app source main and I can see

115
00:04:39,060 --> 00:04:41,010
the very as far as if I wanted to now

116
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:42,930
whenever directories match here the diff

117
00:04:42,930 --> 00:04:45,480
tool will show their files side-by-side

118
00:04:45,480 --> 00:04:46,920
and you can click the file you are

119
00:04:46,920 --> 00:04:49,020
interested in to see it compared to the

120
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:50,250
corresponding file from the other

121
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:52,560
project so I can actually just come over

122
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:54,990
here and select a file and you can see

123
00:04:54,990 --> 00:04:56,070
that the other phone was actually come

124
00:04:56,070 --> 00:04:58,670
up their activity underscore main

125
00:04:58,670 --> 00:05:00,360
scrolling down a bit further

126
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:02,490
I see launcher you can see as I'm doing

127
00:05:02,490 --> 00:05:04,350
that the other side is automatically

128
00:05:04,350 --> 00:05:06,090
being opened and we can compare the

129
00:05:06,090 --> 00:05:08,790
contents on both sides now this works

130
00:05:08,790 --> 00:05:11,220
fine if the company domain was the same

131
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:13,500
for both projects but often that might

132
00:05:13,500 --> 00:05:15,270
that may not be the case though and this

133
00:05:15,270 --> 00:05:17,460
can actually cause problems the

134
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:19,169
resources will still match that's

135
00:05:19,169 --> 00:05:20,669
because they both live in there for

136
00:05:20,669 --> 00:05:22,500
slash main slash res directory off

137
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:26,130
source but the package name is used for

138
00:05:26,130 --> 00:05:28,140
the directory structure and the package

139
00:05:28,140 --> 00:05:30,330
name comes from the company domain that

140
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:32,729
we used when we created the project so

141
00:05:32,729 --> 00:05:34,560
in this particular example our main

142
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,900
activity code file is in the directory

143
00:05:36,900 --> 00:05:40,140
main Java dot Academy don't learn

144
00:05:40,140 --> 00:05:42,690
programming dot calculator and you can

145
00:05:42,690 --> 00:05:43,979
see that when the new directory has been

146
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:45,360
created for each pile and the package

147
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:48,240
name and we can see that a new package

148
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,150
name has been created for each so if you

149
00:05:51,150 --> 00:05:52,580
come back here and actually have a look

150
00:05:52,580 --> 00:05:58,620
main Java you can see up here we've got

151
00:05:58,620 --> 00:06:00,600
source main Java Academy learn

152
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,850
programming calculator now if I have a

153
00:06:02,850 --> 00:06:04,680
project called org dot example dot

154
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:06,479
calculator then obviously the

155
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,550
directories won't match and therefore I

156
00:06:08,550 --> 00:06:10,110
won't be able to compare the Java source

157
00:06:10,110 --> 00:06:12,990
files so the solution to that in that

158
00:06:12,990 --> 00:06:14,310
case there is to choose the package

159
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:17,390
directory when starting the comparison

160
00:06:17,390 --> 00:06:19,560
so to see what I mean I'm going to

161
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:21,300
compare the source code from this

162
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:23,580
project with the source from the YouTube

163
00:06:23,580 --> 00:06:25,470
app from the previous version of this

164
00:06:25,470 --> 00:06:27,960
course so I'm gonna George studio and

165
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:29,430
they're going to go back into Android

166
00:06:29,430 --> 00:06:33,240
view then we're going to explain expand

167
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:36,150
main Java so I've got you can see there

168
00:06:36,150 --> 00:06:37,640
that I've got the Java package open

169
00:06:37,640 --> 00:06:39,690
basically so that I can see the package

170
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:41,280
name in this case

171
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,160
learn programming calculator then I'm

172
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:46,139
going to use ctrl D to get the directory

173
00:06:46,139 --> 00:06:49,320
chooser dialog and navigate to the

174
00:06:49,320 --> 00:06:51,630
YouTube directory I want to say

175
00:06:51,630 --> 00:06:53,250
basically said I need to actually click

176
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:55,440
on that so that that's the folder that

177
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:57,180
I'm actually comparing then I'm going to

178
00:06:57,180 --> 00:06:59,280
do my ctrl D or command D on a Mac

179
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:01,889
that's kind of open up the dialog the

180
00:07:01,889 --> 00:07:03,389
directory picker and I'm going to

181
00:07:03,389 --> 00:07:05,910
navigate to the YouTube directory or the

182
00:07:05,910 --> 00:07:08,730
other project so we're going to go back

183
00:07:08,730 --> 00:07:11,250
to that for the other application the

184
00:07:11,250 --> 00:07:14,330
other project and we go into app source

185
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:19,470
main Java comm noticing the package is

186
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,690
different here timber Cherica eg player

187
00:07:21,690 --> 00:07:23,910
so that's the equivalent level I'm going

188
00:07:23,910 --> 00:07:28,140
to click on open now this is not a

189
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,790
really a very sensible thing to do

190
00:07:29,790 --> 00:07:31,500
because they're completely different

191
00:07:31,500 --> 00:07:33,780
projects but it does show how you can

192
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:35,580
match the source code files from one

193
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,190
project with those from another so

194
00:07:38,190 --> 00:07:39,660
that's how to compare your source files

195
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:41,580
against the source code from the videos

196
00:07:41,580 --> 00:07:43,620
all of which is available from the

197
00:07:43,620 --> 00:07:46,470
resources for each video it is pretty

198
00:07:46,470 --> 00:07:48,390
straightforward particularly once you've

199
00:07:48,390 --> 00:07:50,280
done it a few times and it's really only

200
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,500
slightly more complicated if you're

201
00:07:52,500 --> 00:07:55,050
using a different company domain name -

202
00:07:55,050 --> 00:07:56,910
the one that I've used when creating my

203
00:07:56,910 --> 00:07:59,160
version of the project and if you get

204
00:07:59,160 --> 00:08:01,140
problems with your layouts or code and

205
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:02,580
can't work out what the differences are

206
00:08:02,580 --> 00:08:04,860
this diff tool can actually save a lot

207
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:07,229
of time and frustration now the last

208
00:08:07,229 --> 00:08:09,330
thing I mentioned is that the ctrl D or

209
00:08:09,330 --> 00:08:11,940
command D shortcut only works if you've

210
00:08:11,940 --> 00:08:13,560
clicked on something in the project pane

211
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:16,350
and if you're editing a file ctrl D will

212
00:08:16,350 --> 00:08:18,330
duplicate the current line of code so

213
00:08:18,330 --> 00:08:20,100
what's out for that alright so let's

214
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:22,050
finish the video here in the next video

215
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:23,520
we're going to create the code to make

216
00:08:23,520 --> 00:08:25,979
our calculator work so we'll see you in

217
00:08:25,979 --> 00:08:28,580
the next video
