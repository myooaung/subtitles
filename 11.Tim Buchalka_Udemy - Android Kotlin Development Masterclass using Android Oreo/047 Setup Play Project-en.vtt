00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:06.330

Now there are a number of different



2

00:00:06.330 --> 00:00:08.970

layouts that you can use to create app



3

00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:10.559

screens in Android studio



4

00:00:10.559 --> 00:00:12.150

and we're gonna have a quick look at a



5

00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.759

few others a little bit later using



6

00:00:14.759 --> 00:00:16.500

layouts to position items on the screen



7

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.630

used to be quite complicated when you



8

00:00:18.630 --> 00:00:19.949

wanted to line things up horizontally



9

00:00:19.949 --> 00:00:22.410

and vertically to get the screen just



10

00:00:22.410 --> 00:00:24.269

the way you want but when they're



11

00:00:24.269 --> 00:00:26.699

released Android Nuka Google introduced



12

00:00:26.699 --> 00:00:29.429

the constraint layout and that basically



13

00:00:29.429 --> 00:00:31.980

replaces the old relative layout and is



14

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:34.110

also a good alternative to many of the



15

00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:36.300

older layouts now we're going to discuss



16

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:38.309

the older layouts later so that you're



17

00:00:38.309 --> 00:00:40.260

familiar with them you may have to work



18

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:42.210

on updating older code so it's good to



19

00:00:42.210 --> 00:00:43.590

at least be familiar with some of these



20

00:00:43.590 --> 00:00:45.930

other layouts but for most of the



21

00:00:45.930 --> 00:00:47.969

examples in this course I'm going to be



22

00:00:47.969 --> 00:00:50.010

eating the new constraint layout and the



23

00:00:50.010 --> 00:00:51.930

trusty linear layout when creating



24

00:00:51.930 --> 00:00:54.780

layout screens now Google didn't just



25

00:00:54.780 --> 00:00:56.280

introduce a new type of layout



26

00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:58.350

they also completely revamped the



27

00:00:58.350 --> 00:01:00.719

Android studio layout designer to handle



28

00:01:00.719 --> 00:01:02.489

it so we're going to start a new project



29

00:01:02.489 --> 00:01:05.010

and get into discovering how to use the



30

00:01:05.010 --> 00:01:07.500

layout designer now the first project



31

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.060

we're going to create isn't that our



32

00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:11.070

button click app it's just something



33

00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:12.479

that we're going to have a play with the



34

00:01:12.479 --> 00:01:14.490

designer and probably get it into a



35

00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:16.680

right mess now the only way though to



36

00:01:16.680 --> 00:01:19.590

learn how to use the designer is to try



37

00:01:19.590 --> 00:01:21.960

it out so I'm not even going to run this



38

00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:23.909

app I'm just going to be placing things



39

00:01:23.909 --> 00:01:25.740

on the screen moving them around and



40

00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:27.630

showing you how to put things where you



41

00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:29.729

want them and have them stay there and



42

00:01:29.729 --> 00:01:31.320

that's why I said we were going to play



43

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:34.710

with it so make sure you do have fun but



44

00:01:34.710 --> 00:01:36.810

before we start that just wanted to



45

00:01:36.810 --> 00:01:38.490

point out that one of the best widgets



46

00:01:38.490 --> 00:01:41.070

for demonstrating this is an image view



47

00:01:41.070 --> 00:01:43.049

and that's because it's a very visual



48

00:01:43.049 --> 00:01:45.360

component and you can easily see it on



49

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.159

the screen so I'm going to be adding an



50

00:01:47.159 --> 00:01:49.890

image view to our layout now an image



51

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:51.570

view without an image isn't very



52

00:01:51.570 --> 00:01:53.399

interesting though so the first thing



53

00:01:53.399 --> 00:01:55.320

you want to do is start by downloading



54

00:01:55.320 --> 00:01:57.719

the sample images that I've included in



55

00:01:57.719 --> 00:02:00.689

the resources section for this video now



56

00:02:00.689 --> 00:02:02.009

you can actually get them by moving your



57

00:02:02.009 --> 00:02:03.509

mouse up to the top left of this video



58

00:02:03.509 --> 00:02:06.180

and clicking on the three bar menu icon



59

00:02:06.180 --> 00:02:09.149

above resources available and that will



60

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:11.160

slide out a panel and you'll see the two



61

00:02:11.160 --> 00:02:13.840

resources in this case ball underscore see



62

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:17.800

40 by 480 jpg and also ball underscore



63

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:21.550

100 by 100 dot jpg so download those



64

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.379

files and save them onto your hard drive



65

00:02:23.379 --> 00:02:25.569

and then click the X above the tooltip



66

00:02:25.569 --> 00:02:26.680

when you've done that and you're ready



67

00:02:26.680 --> 00:02:29.890

to continue with this video now you can



68

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:31.690

of course use any any image that you



69

00:02:31.690 --> 00:02:33.940

want so by all means use one of your own



70

00:02:33.940 --> 00:02:36.489

pictures images if you prefer one thing



71

00:02:36.489 --> 00:02:37.870

to note though is that there's a really



72

00:02:37.870 --> 00:02:40.750

odd peculiarity in Android studio and



73

00:02:40.750 --> 00:02:42.790

that's that it doesn't like images that



74

00:02:42.790 --> 00:02:45.069

have capital letters in the filename now



75

00:02:45.069 --> 00:02:47.170

you can only use the characters 0 to 9



76

00:02:47.170 --> 00:02:50.079

and lowercase a to Z as well as the dash



77

00:02:50.079 --> 00:02:52.840

underscore in . now you might be



78

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.760

wondering why that is the case but in



79

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.410

fact there's a good reason for this and



80

00:02:56.410 --> 00:02:59.019

the reason is that filenames in windows



81

00:02:59.019 --> 00:03:00.370

aren't case-sensitive



82

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:02.920

in other words Bordeaux jpg with a



83

00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.290

capital B would be the same file as



84

00:03:05.290 --> 00:03:08.650

balled-up jpg with a lowercase B however



85

00:03:08.650 --> 00:03:12.010

on Linux or OSX Mac OS X they would



86

00:03:12.010 --> 00:03:14.650

actually be two different files so it



87

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:16.959

would be very easy to produce a project



88

00:03:16.959 --> 00:03:19.420

on one operating system that ultimately



89

00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:20.950

wouldn't work on another operating



90

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:23.769

system so rather than building a complex



91

00:03:23.769 --> 00:03:25.780

set of checking Google just made the



92

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.430

rule that uppercase letters aren't



93

00:03:27.430 --> 00:03:29.290

allowed which makes everyone's life



94

00:03:29.290 --> 00:03:31.870

easier so bear that in mind when you



95

00:03:31.870 --> 00:03:33.579

create any type of resource in Android



96

00:03:33.579 --> 00:03:35.709

studio including your images you should



97

00:03:35.709 --> 00:03:37.560

really be using just a lowercase letters



98

00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:40.389

now I also should suggest if you are



99

00:03:40.389 --> 00:03:42.790

intending to use your own images that



100

00:03:42.790 --> 00:03:44.709

you don't use a full HD in other words



101

00:03:44.709 --> 00:03:47.590

of 1920 by 1080 image remembering that



102

00:03:47.590 --> 00:03:49.090

this is going to be viewed on a 3-inch



103

00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:52.989

wide screen alright so hopefully at this



104

00:03:52.989 --> 00:03:54.400

point you've got the image file ready



105

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:57.370

it's time to create our test project so



106

00:03:57.370 --> 00:03:59.319

I've got Android studio started now once



107

00:03:59.319 --> 00:04:00.819

you can see on the screen and click on



108

00:04:00.819 --> 00:04:04.480

start a new Android studio project now



109

00:04:04.480 --> 00:04:05.349

we're going to be playing with the



110

00:04:05.349 --> 00:04:07.150

designer a bit like a child with a box



111

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:09.250

of crayons so for that reason I'm going



112

00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:13.660

to call this project plane now if you



113

00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:15.730

make a write this and frankly I hope



114

00:04:15.730 --> 00:04:17.979

that you do because it shows you've been



115

00:04:17.979 --> 00:04:20.109

experimenting then you can create a new



116

00:04:20.109 --> 00:04:22.060

project and call it playing 2 or playing



117

00:04:22.060 --> 00:04:25.240

3 etc and also you can make a note of



118

00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:26.740

the project location which you can see



119

00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:27.610

over here



120

00:04:27.610 --> 00:04:29.530

at the bottom of the screen and you can



121

00:04:29.530 --> 00:04:31.180

use your file manager to delete the



122

00:04:31.180 --> 00:04:33.099

entire playing directory if you wish



123

00:04:33.099 --> 00:04:35.020

before starting again that's entirely up



124

00:04:35.020 --> 00:04:38.500

to you know the company domain should



125

00:04:38.500 --> 00:04:40.300

have been remembered from last time so



126

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:41.379

I'm going to leave that as to what it



127

00:04:41.379 --> 00:04:44.770

was learn programming Academy now you of



128

00:04:44.770 --> 00:04:46.300

course are free to use your own domain



129

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.250

there if you prefer but one thing to



130

00:04:48.250 --> 00:04:50.169

bear in mind is that my sample code will



131

00:04:50.169 --> 00:04:53.020

be using learn programming economy so



132

00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:54.969

using something different can make it



133

00:04:54.969 --> 00:04:56.770

harder for you to use differencing tools



134

00:04:56.770 --> 00:04:58.419

on the projects when comparing your



135

00:04:58.419 --> 00:05:00.610

source code with mine now I'm going to



136

00:05:00.610 --> 00:05:02.259

be covering that later in this course so



137

00:05:02.259 --> 00:05:04.150

if you want to keep things simple then



138

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:05.770

use the same domain names that I'm using



139

00:05:05.770 --> 00:05:08.259

here learn programming dot Academy so



140

00:05:08.259 --> 00:05:10.000

the project location should have been



141

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.500

filled in for you as it was for me on



142

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.849

the screen there and you can change that



143

00:05:12.849 --> 00:05:15.629

to any suitable directory if you prefer



144

00:05:15.629 --> 00:05:17.770

now the last thing to check on this



145

00:05:17.770 --> 00:05:20.830

screen is the box labeled include Kotlin



146

00:05:20.830 --> 00:05:23.229

support and you can see over here that



147

00:05:23.229 --> 00:05:25.479

that is checked by default if you don't



148

00:05:25.479 --> 00:05:27.879

tick that box Android studio is going to



149

00:05:27.879 --> 00:05:31.840

generate Java code instead of Kotlin now



150

00:05:31.840 --> 00:05:33.069

there's no difference in designing



151

00:05:33.069 --> 00:05:34.779

layouts whether you're using Java or



152

00:05:34.779 --> 00:05:36.909

Kotlin so this video is the same for my



153

00:05:36.909 --> 00:05:39.669

java and Kotlin Android courses so if



154

00:05:39.669 --> 00:05:41.650

you're actually in my Java Android



155

00:05:41.650 --> 00:05:43.539

course in fact you'd want to take the



156

00:05:43.539 --> 00:05:45.370

check box off but if you're in the



157

00:05:45.370 --> 00:05:47.050

cotton course you want to click that to



158

00:05:47.050 --> 00:05:49.509

include Kotlin support and by the way



159

00:05:49.509 --> 00:05:51.430

it's perfectly possible to mix Java and



160

00:05:51.430 --> 00:05:53.919

Kotlin in the same project in which case



161

00:05:53.919 --> 00:05:56.469

you tick the box if you were deciding to



162

00:05:56.469 --> 00:05:58.089

use a Java project to also include



163

00:05:58.089 --> 00:06:00.279

Kotlin support for new though I suggest



164

00:06:00.279 --> 00:06:02.169

that if you are in the Java course you



165

00:06:02.169 --> 00:06:03.940

leave it on ticked for Java and ticked



166

00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.469

for Kotlin so I'm going to click on next



167

00:06:07.469 --> 00:06:09.550

so in this screen I'm going to choose



168

00:06:09.550 --> 00:06:12.699

API 17 as the default as I've explained



169

00:06:12.699 --> 00:06:15.460

in a previous video now we don't want



170

00:06:15.460 --> 00:06:17.199

any of these other options I leave them



171

00:06:17.199 --> 00:06:20.080

all unchecked and click on next now for



172

00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.669

our purposes here we're going to use the



173

00:06:21.669 --> 00:06:23.889

empty activity and that's highlighted by



174

00:06:23.889 --> 00:06:26.259

default but if not check on that and



175

00:06:26.259 --> 00:06:29.169

click on next again now there's nothing



176

00:06:29.169 --> 00:06:30.759

to change on this next screen but you do



177

00:06:30.759 --> 00:06:32.639

want to make sure that the two boxes



178

00:06:32.639 --> 00:06:35.110

generate layout file with the checkbox



179

00:06:35.110 --> 00:06:36.759

to the left there and backwards



180

00:06:36.759 --> 00:06:39.250

compatibility app compat you want to



181

00:06:39.250 --> 00:06:40.539

make sure that they're both checked as



182

00:06:40.539 --> 00:06:40.930

they are



183

00:06:40.930 --> 00:06:43.720

case and in terms of what they do will



184

00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:46.030

generate to layout function creates a



185

00:06:46.030 --> 00:06:48.460

layout file for you and if you want a



186

00:06:48.460 --> 00:06:50.050

ticket then you just have to create the



187

00:06:50.050 --> 00:06:51.729

layout from scratch now that actually



188

00:06:51.729 --> 00:06:53.979

isn't hard to do and in fact in future



189

00:06:53.979 --> 00:06:55.389

videos we'll be creating another layer



190

00:06:55.389 --> 00:06:58.090

later that to white create will work at



191

00:06:58.090 --> 00:07:00.039

this stage of the course and the



192

00:07:00.039 --> 00:07:02.889

backwards compatibility box or the check



193

00:07:02.889 --> 00:07:05.440

box that causes Android studio to use



194

00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:07.690

the app compat library and that's so



195

00:07:07.690 --> 00:07:09.070

that your code will work on earlier



196

00:07:09.070 --> 00:07:11.110

versions of Android even if they use



197

00:07:11.110 --> 00:07:12.759

features that were introduced in later



198

00:07:12.759 --> 00:07:15.370

versions there's very rarely a reason to



199

00:07:15.370 --> 00:07:17.380

unpick this so I'm going to leave it



200

00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:17.940

checked



201

00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.050

you know the suggested knowns for the



202

00:07:20.050 --> 00:07:22.120

activity and layout main activity and



203

00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:24.789

activity underscore main affine so I'm



204

00:07:24.789 --> 00:07:27.889

now going to click on finish



205

00:07:27.889 --> 00:07:29.870

then Android studio is now in the



206

00:07:29.870 --> 00:07:31.849

processes of creating the project and



207

00:07:31.849 --> 00:07:33.800

you can see that the build progress so



208

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:35.509

the build progress rather as it does



209

00:07:35.509 --> 00:07:37.789

that and I'm running at this stage as



210

00:07:37.789 --> 00:07:39.740

you can see a beta version of Android



211

00:07:39.740 --> 00:07:42.110

studio 3 so it's a little bit slower



212

00:07:42.110 --> 00:07:44.060

than what the final release will be but



213

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:49.900

we'll give it a moment to finish



214

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:51.310

all right you can see down the bottom



215

00:07:51.310 --> 00:07:52.990

right hand corner that's working away



216

00:07:52.990 --> 00:07:55.600

and the Gradle build is running and it's



217

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.120

actually indexing a few files it



218

00:07:58.120 --> 00:07:59.440

actually does quite a bit of stuff even



219

00:07:59.440 --> 00:08:01.169

after the editing window has appeared



220

00:08:01.169 --> 00:08:03.460

and it's a good idea not to do too much



221

00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:04.720

until all that's finished you can see



222

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.070

now down the bottom right hand corner of



223

00:08:06.070 --> 00:08:08.320

the screen the progress bars disappeared



224

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.780

and for all intents and purposes now



225

00:08:10.780 --> 00:08:13.720

it's finished setting things up and



226

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:17.080

we're ready to go all right so there's a



227

00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.400

few things now that I want to talk about



228

00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:21.340

with the layout designer and firstly



229

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:23.620

experiment and try things out you know



230

00:08:23.620 --> 00:08:25.000

make a mess of it all and start again



231

00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.919

maybe more than once you won't actually



232

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:28.960

do any harm and you can always delete



233

00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:31.150

the project directories when you've made



234

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.039

a right mess of things if you're going



235

00:08:33.039 --> 00:08:34.209

to do that you'd obviously want to shop



236

00:08:34.209 --> 00:08:35.830

to an Android studio before he deleted



237

00:08:35.830 --> 00:08:37.930

anything now it's in particularly



238

00:08:37.930 --> 00:08:39.909

important to experiment with the layout



239

00:08:39.909 --> 00:08:41.979

designer and that's because it changes



240

00:08:41.979 --> 00:08:44.650

so much now Google introduced this new



241

00:08:44.650 --> 00:08:47.320

layout designer in Android studio 2.2



242

00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:51.190

back in 2016 and personally I've lost



243

00:08:51.190 --> 00:08:52.839

count of how many changes they've made



244

00:08:52.839 --> 00:08:56.020

to it through to version 2.3 3 and now



245

00:08:56.020 --> 00:08:58.930

what we're running Android studio 3 now



246

00:08:58.930 --> 00:09:00.100

we're actually working at the cutting



247

00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:03.040

edge of mobile technology and Google are



248

00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:05.529

constantly changing things now something



249

00:09:05.529 --> 00:09:07.600

that works in a certain way today may



250

00:09:07.600 --> 00:09:09.490

very well not work in that way or may



251

00:09:09.490 --> 00:09:12.010

work differently tomorrow now we do



252

00:09:12.010 --> 00:09:13.930

record videos frequently in this course



253

00:09:13.930 --> 00:09:15.850

but if we try to keep up with all the



254

00:09:15.850 --> 00:09:17.470

changes would never get any new content



255

00:09:17.470 --> 00:09:19.810

added as it turns out I'm recalling



256

00:09:19.810 --> 00:09:21.790

these videos in August and September



257

00:09:21.790 --> 00:09:23.860

because Android Studios layout designer



258

00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.900

is now very different to what it was



259

00:09:25.900 --> 00:09:28.209

back in for every 2017



260

00:09:28.209 --> 00:09:30.490

now that variable main make life



261

00:09:30.490 --> 00:09:31.930

interesting quite and quite interesting



262

00:09:31.930 --> 00:09:33.640

for us but I don't want you to feel



263

00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:36.820

sorry for me it's far harder for you now



264

00:09:36.820 --> 00:09:38.260

you're having to learn how to use a



265

00:09:38.260 --> 00:09:39.730

development environment that's changing



266

00:09:39.730 --> 00:09:41.560

all the time and frankly that's



267

00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:43.900

certainly not easy when you're learning



268

00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:46.140

to you and something new like Android



269

00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.700

myself and JP we're so used to all of



270

00:09:48.700 --> 00:09:50.470

this that sometimes we barely notice a



271

00:09:50.470 --> 00:09:52.420

change but when you're standing out and



272

00:09:52.420 --> 00:09:54.940

you haven't had much experience in the



273

00:09:54.940 --> 00:09:57.040

software or in Android in general it can



274

00:09:57.040 --> 00:09:59.050

get very confusing now there's not



275

00:09:59.050 --> 00:10:01.570

really a lot that you can do about this



276

00:10:01.570 --> 00:10:03.670

other than learning to live with it



277

00:10:03.670 --> 00:10:06.520

experimenting now there was something we



278

00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.470

can do to help and that's to explain



279

00:10:08.470 --> 00:10:09.430

what's going on



280

00:10:09.430 --> 00:10:11.350

so in these videos in this section of



281

00:10:11.350 --> 00:10:13.240

the course I won't just be showing you a



282

00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:15.400

series of keys to press or operations to



283

00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:17.470

perform I'm gonna be explaining why



284

00:10:17.470 --> 00:10:18.910

you're doing what you're doing



285

00:10:18.910 --> 00:10:20.980

that way you'll develop an understanding



286

00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.630

of what's going on why you're doing



287

00:10:22.630 --> 00:10:24.670

certain things and what's happening when



288

00:10:24.670 --> 00:10:27.220

you do now when you really understand



289

00:10:27.220 --> 00:10:29.350

how it's all working change is much



290

00:10:29.350 --> 00:10:31.660

easier to deal with all right so that's



291

00:10:31.660 --> 00:10:33.460

what I'm going to be doing what you can



292

00:10:33.460 --> 00:10:35.650

do though is experiment try things out



293

00:10:35.650 --> 00:10:37.720

you know if you're not sure what a



294

00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:39.820

button on the toolbar does one of these



295

00:10:39.820 --> 00:10:41.380

buttons up here then just click one and



296

00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:43.120

see what happens when you click it what



297

00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:44.320

actually pops up on the screen when



298

00:10:44.320 --> 00:10:46.300

there happens and just really had just



299

00:10:46.300 --> 00:10:47.440

really experiment with the various



300

00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:49.450

buttons to see what happens when you do



301

00:10:49.450 --> 00:10:51.880

it what I can guarantee is one thing it



302

00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:54.070

won't damage your computer the very



303

00:10:54.070 --> 00:10:55.900

worst thing that will happen is that you



304

00:10:55.900 --> 00:10:57.490

will do strange things to the project



305

00:10:57.490 --> 00:10:59.410

and may have to start over again from



306

00:10:59.410 --> 00:11:01.210

scratch but when you're learning going



307

00:11:01.210 --> 00:11:02.380

through the one again is a good thing



308

00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:05.140

all right now for the good news what



309

00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.090

I've been saying really only applies to



310

00:11:07.090 --> 00:11:10.060

the layout designer the Android code



311

00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:12.820

base is far more stable that changes far



312

00:11:12.820 --> 00:11:14.530

less frequently you know there are



313

00:11:14.530 --> 00:11:16.360

changes that affect the code things like



314

00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:18.430

annotations that we'll be looking at but



315

00:11:18.430 --> 00:11:20.830

generally the code side of things well



316

00:11:20.830 --> 00:11:22.990

that doesn't change very often so it's



317

00:11:22.990 --> 00:11:24.310

not going to be as difficult as I may



318

00:11:24.310 --> 00:11:25.870

have implied just now it's just that



319

00:11:25.870 --> 00:11:27.820

this visual layout designer is the thing



320

00:11:27.820 --> 00:11:29.890

that changes so often. Alright so let's



321

00:11:29.890 --> 00:11:31.960

finish this video here and in the next



322

00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:33.610

video we'll start getting stuck in and



323

00:11:33.610 --> 00:11:36.490

talking more about and using the layout



324

00:11:36.490 --> 00:11:40.170

designer. See you in the next video.
