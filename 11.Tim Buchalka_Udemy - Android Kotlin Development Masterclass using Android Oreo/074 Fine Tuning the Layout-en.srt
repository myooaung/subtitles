1
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:07,860
alright let's solve the challenge that I

2
00:00:07,860 --> 00:00:09,720
gave to right at the end of the last

3
00:00:09,720 --> 00:00:11,910
video so to start off with what we need

4
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:13,860
to do is constrain the left edge of new

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:15,510
numbers I'm going to click on that you

6
00:00:15,510 --> 00:00:17,330
know when it texts a new number so

7
00:00:17,330 --> 00:00:19,619
constrain the left edge of that to the

8
00:00:19,619 --> 00:00:26,430
left edge of the layout so and it's

9
00:00:26,430 --> 00:00:28,020
right edge to the right edge of the

10
00:00:28,020 --> 00:00:34,110
layout so it sizes in both planes should

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:36,330
be set to replica on 10th already and it

12
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,190
is in this case but if it's not in your

13
00:00:38,190 --> 00:00:40,770
revision make sure you change them and

14
00:00:40,770 --> 00:00:42,360
also want to set make sure the three

15
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:43,829
merchants are all set to eight which

16
00:00:43,829 --> 00:00:45,390
they are set here with as we can see in

17
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:47,520
the inspector and finally set the

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,920
horizontal slider to be set to 50 if

19
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,750
it's not already but again in my case it

20
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,809
is set now the operation textview should

21
00:00:54,809 --> 00:00:56,640
also be set to wrap on a scroll content

22
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,700
so I'm going to click on the text view

23
00:00:58,700 --> 00:01:00,989
and you can see that's set for apples

24
00:01:00,989 --> 00:01:02,699
core content and the slider should be

25
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:06,090
set to 50 which it is and the left and

26
00:01:06,090 --> 00:01:07,770
right margins are set to the same value

27
00:01:07,770 --> 00:01:10,770
now we're using 8 here but 16 would be

28
00:01:10,770 --> 00:01:12,990
ok as well now because it's only

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:14,819
displaying a single character which

30
00:01:14,819 --> 00:01:16,979
might look a bit lost I'm going to use

31
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:18,479
the properties on the right-hand side to

32
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,610
set the text size to a larger size to 18

33
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:23,550
SP and also set the bold button just

34
00:01:23,550 --> 00:01:25,770
below that I come down here you can

35
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:29,580
click on bold and also change this as I

36
00:01:29,580 --> 00:01:34,800
mentioned to 18 SP it's in to there now

37
00:01:34,800 --> 00:01:36,360
we can't see much change at the moment

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:38,280
but as both of the edit text widgets

39
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:41,459
also use a text size of 18 SP this text

40
00:01:41,459 --> 00:01:44,009
view will look better at that size now

41
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:45,630
that's looking pretty good but before I

42
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:48,780
forget we also want to allow single with

43
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:50,789
decimal numbers things like negative

44
00:01:50,789 --> 00:01:53,280
four point five six seven now the edit

45
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:55,259
text widget we've used allows sign

46
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,229
numbers but not decimal so we need to or

47
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:00,630
we have a change to make so when I

48
00:02:00,630 --> 00:02:02,729
select the result widget over in the

49
00:02:02,729 --> 00:02:05,340
inputs to the right here is input type

50
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:07,679
and you can see it's set to number side

51
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:10,560
now we also want that to be number

52
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:11,849
decimal so I'm gonna click on this

53
00:02:11,849 --> 00:02:15,180
ellipsis button over here you can see

54
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:17,260
that we get a menu where that pops up

55
00:02:17,260 --> 00:02:18,849
and we can KITT we can then tick the

56
00:02:18,849 --> 00:02:21,159
options we want so after coming down

57
00:02:21,159 --> 00:02:23,079
here and selecting number decimal by

58
00:02:23,079 --> 00:02:26,680
checking the box and clicking on OK we

59
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:28,180
can see now that both those options are

60
00:02:28,180 --> 00:02:29,379
in there there's like none by saying

61
00:02:29,379 --> 00:02:31,269
that was there and then there's a pipe

62
00:02:31,269 --> 00:02:33,849
character than the number decimal I want

63
00:02:33,849 --> 00:02:35,500
to do the same nail for the new numbers

64
00:02:35,500 --> 00:02:38,049
I click on that come over here to the

65
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:40,750
ellipsis and add number decimal or check

66
00:02:40,750 --> 00:02:43,030
of a decimal as well so that's now set

67
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:45,519
to both values and if you don't do that

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:47,530
you won't be able to use button dot to

69
00:02:47,530 --> 00:02:49,750
it to enter a decimal point into your

70
00:02:49,750 --> 00:02:52,359
numbers now there's one last change I

71
00:02:52,359 --> 00:02:54,250
want to make to the result and it text

72
00:02:54,250 --> 00:02:57,459
widget so we'll select that now when we

73
00:02:57,459 --> 00:02:59,139
ran the button click app this soft

74
00:02:59,139 --> 00:03:00,879
keyboard appeared automatically on the

75
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,040
screen and let us type into the edit

76
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,260
text widget now we know what uses to be

77
00:03:05,260 --> 00:03:06,970
able to type into the result widget

78
00:03:06,970 --> 00:03:08,920
that's just there to display the result

79
00:03:08,920 --> 00:03:11,230
of the calculation now the way to

80
00:03:11,230 --> 00:03:13,299
prevent that behavior is to use the

81
00:03:13,299 --> 00:03:15,940
focusable attributes so when i actually

82
00:03:15,940 --> 00:03:19,000
expand the at the list of attributes and

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,330
scroll down

84
00:03:22,330 --> 00:03:26,600
see here we've got focusable as well as

85
00:03:26,600 --> 00:03:29,030
focus in touch mode now the reason for

86
00:03:29,030 --> 00:03:31,160
two properties is that mobile devices

87
00:03:31,160 --> 00:03:33,980
can have different input methods for

88
00:03:33,980 --> 00:03:35,630
example you could have a phone that only

89
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:37,700
works in touch mode and a tablet that

90
00:03:37,700 --> 00:03:39,950
has a physical keyboard connected in

91
00:03:39,950 --> 00:03:41,780
which case it's not in touch mode

92
00:03:41,780 --> 00:03:44,030
actually most modern Android phones

93
00:03:44,030 --> 00:03:47,630
support USB on-the-go or USB OTG so that

94
00:03:47,630 --> 00:03:48,980
you can connect an external keyboard

95
00:03:48,980 --> 00:03:51,350
and/or mouse to them and if you do that

96
00:03:51,350 --> 00:03:53,810
they'll actually no longer be in touch

97
00:03:53,810 --> 00:03:56,120
mode either and when a device is in

98
00:03:56,120 --> 00:03:59,390
touch mode widgets are not focusable but

99
00:03:59,390 --> 00:04:01,190
there is an exception for widgets that

100
00:04:01,190 --> 00:04:02,750
are designed for text input like the

101
00:04:02,750 --> 00:04:05,480
edit text that we're using so we need to

102
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:08,360
set both of these attributes to false to

103
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,130
prevent the soft keyboard from appearing

104
00:04:10,130 --> 00:04:11,360
when they use attempts the widget or

105
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,209
clicks on it with an external mouse so

106
00:04:14,209 --> 00:04:15,680
I'll come over here now to focusable

107
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,530
and select the drop-down you can see

108
00:04:18,530 --> 00:04:20,959
that the focus and will actually be it

109
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:23,450
only shows true and auto so we need to

110
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:25,730
actually type in false for this one when

111
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:28,300
the type in false and press Enter

112
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,710
but on the other hand focusable in touch

113
00:04:30,710 --> 00:04:33,260
mode if I click into there I'm just

114
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:34,340
going to expand this out a little bit

115
00:04:34,340 --> 00:04:35,360
more so we can see it a little bit

116
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:38,390
better you know focus I'm in touch mode

117
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:39,560
you can see that I'm actually clicking

118
00:04:39,560 --> 00:04:44,000
here it uses a tri-state checkbox and it

119
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,100
can be set to one of three states a dash

120
00:04:46,100 --> 00:04:47,810
means it's set to the default which it

121
00:04:47,810 --> 00:04:49,940
is now a tick means it's set to true and

122
00:04:49,940 --> 00:04:52,430
if it's empty that's false but

123
00:04:52,430 --> 00:04:53,720
unfortunately as you can see here it

124
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:56,630
doesn't work in sexualy a bug now it's a

125
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,800
bug that's been present for quite a

126
00:04:57,800 --> 00:04:59,120
while actually since the Android studio

127
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:01,970
2.3 and by the way I've mentioned a few

128
00:05:01,970 --> 00:05:03,919
bugs so far but don't let that put you

129
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,140
off Android studio remember that this

130
00:05:06,140 --> 00:05:08,600
layout design is just a convenience so

131
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:09,860
that you don't have to type in loads of

132
00:05:09,860 --> 00:05:12,200
XML in the first version of this course

133
00:05:12,200 --> 00:05:14,450
a few years ago that's how we created

134
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,760
the layouts by typing in the XML so

135
00:05:16,760 --> 00:05:18,110
things have certainly come a long way

136
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:19,640
and obviously over time will get even

137
00:05:19,640 --> 00:05:22,280
better but in our case now what can we

138
00:05:22,280 --> 00:05:24,740
do about this bug or the worker Pat the

139
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:26,750
workaround is to use the tools properly

140
00:05:26,750 --> 00:05:28,729
instead now you may have noticed that

141
00:05:28,729 --> 00:05:30,590
some of these attributes seem to appear

142
00:05:30,590 --> 00:05:32,450
twice with one version having a spanner

143
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:35,360
or wrench in American next to them

144
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,060
one example is the text attribute which

145
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,349
we can see when I collapse the

146
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:41,569
attributes so we've got text and they've

147
00:05:41,569 --> 00:05:43,129
got this one with a spanner or a wrench

148
00:05:43,129 --> 00:05:46,370
but that are of the same name so these

149
00:05:46,370 --> 00:05:48,319
are tool attributes and only apply

150
00:05:48,319 --> 00:05:50,689
inside the layout designer so that means

151
00:05:50,689 --> 00:05:52,610
that changing these the ones with the

152
00:05:52,610 --> 00:05:54,469
wrench or the spanner they've got no

153
00:05:54,469 --> 00:05:56,479
effect when you run the app so just to

154
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,509
show you what I mean in the text you can

155
00:05:59,509 --> 00:06:01,789
type in say negative eight seven six

156
00:06:01,789 --> 00:06:05,030
five point four three and you can see

157
00:06:05,030 --> 00:06:07,340
that immediately shows up in the actual

158
00:06:07,340 --> 00:06:10,940
field itself in the result edit text now

159
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:14,750
if I actually delete them again and come

160
00:06:14,750 --> 00:06:17,180
down here to the text one with the

161
00:06:17,180 --> 00:06:19,039
spanner or wrench and press Enter

162
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:21,830
that still shows but the difference here

163
00:06:21,830 --> 00:06:25,490
is that the number in the second one in

164
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,139
this second field with one with the

165
00:06:27,139 --> 00:06:28,819
wrench will the spanner that won't

166
00:06:28,819 --> 00:06:31,190
appear when we run the app so it's

167
00:06:31,190 --> 00:06:32,330
basically there to help you with a

168
00:06:32,330 --> 00:06:34,849
visual display well so we go back to the

169
00:06:34,849 --> 00:06:36,710
focusable in touch mode actually reading

170
00:06:36,710 --> 00:06:40,490
the extended list we can come over here

171
00:06:40,490 --> 00:06:42,050
and we can actually click on this little

172
00:06:42,050 --> 00:06:44,599
spanner to the right-hand side and you

173
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:45,560
can see when I've done that that's

174
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:48,529
opened up another one but just below now

175
00:06:48,529 --> 00:06:49,909
this one doesn't suffer from the same

176
00:06:49,909 --> 00:06:51,830
bug and we can come down here we can

177
00:06:51,830 --> 00:06:54,199
click on this and you can see that works

178
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:57,440
we've got a checkbox now and then we

179
00:06:57,440 --> 00:06:59,810
want to turn it off to make it false so

180
00:06:59,810 --> 00:07:01,639
this one doesn't suffer as you can see

181
00:07:01,639 --> 00:07:03,889
from the same bug and we're able to

182
00:07:03,889 --> 00:07:05,750
ticket and obviously because it's the

183
00:07:05,750 --> 00:07:07,969
wrench or the spanner version it's not

184
00:07:07,969 --> 00:07:09,349
going to have any effect when we run the

185
00:07:09,349 --> 00:07:11,960
app but what we can do is come over here

186
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:15,349
and click on the text tab you can see

187
00:07:15,349 --> 00:07:17,599
we've got tools colon focusable in touch

188
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:19,759
my own equals false well I can change

189
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,509
that to Android so in other words come

190
00:07:23,509 --> 00:07:26,839
up here and change it to Android we're

191
00:07:26,839 --> 00:07:27,830
going to come over here and set that to

192
00:07:27,830 --> 00:07:32,150
true as well good enough finis it was

193
00:07:32,150 --> 00:07:33,830
and I'm gonna take the other opportunity

194
00:07:33,830 --> 00:07:36,440
now just delete the the text as well

195
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,159
because we don't need that anymore all

196
00:07:40,159 --> 00:07:41,120
right so now that we've done that though

197
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:44,000
we come back to design you can see we've

198
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,250
now got a checkbox in the focusable in

199
00:07:46,250 --> 00:07:47,690
touch mode in the first one not in the

200
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:48,830
tools one

201
00:07:48,830 --> 00:07:50,470
I can actually tick that again now and

202
00:07:50,470 --> 00:07:53,030
turn the effect off and actually make it

203
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,610
false so that's a quick way to work

204
00:07:55,610 --> 00:07:57,800
around this particular bug and by the

205
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:00,440
way if I click on the third time we get

206
00:08:00,440 --> 00:08:02,120
the dash back again and you won't be

207
00:08:02,120 --> 00:08:03,170
able to change it back again without

208
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:04,730
using the tools that you buuuut again so

209
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:05,870
I'll click on that now you can see that

210
00:08:05,870 --> 00:08:08,330
it's not working but then I can't do the

211
00:08:08,330 --> 00:08:09,860
same thing here and come back under the

212
00:08:09,860 --> 00:08:13,210
tools version of it back into design

213
00:08:13,210 --> 00:08:16,940
into text rather and change tools to

214
00:08:16,940 --> 00:08:20,630
Android and leave it on false because

215
00:08:20,630 --> 00:08:22,010
that's ultimately what we want to set to

216
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:25,010
be and that's now working and then I can

217
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,930
come over here so I can close down the

218
00:08:26,930 --> 00:08:29,810
tools version alright so at this point

219
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:31,940
now we've disabled both focusable and

220
00:08:31,940 --> 00:08:34,610
focusable in touch mode for the result

221
00:08:34,610 --> 00:08:37,550
edit text now we could do the same with

222
00:08:37,550 --> 00:08:39,740
the new number in a text widget whether

223
00:08:39,740 --> 00:08:41,420
to allow the soft keyboard to be used

224
00:08:41,420 --> 00:08:43,370
with it is the sort of desired decision

225
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,530
you have to make when creating your user

226
00:08:45,530 --> 00:08:47,450
interface in other words doesn't make

227
00:08:47,450 --> 00:08:49,640
sense to restrict the entry of numbers

228
00:08:49,640 --> 00:08:52,070
to our buttons only possibly would be

229
00:08:52,070 --> 00:08:54,320
the answer but if someone is using an

230
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,570
external keyboard that'd probably be a

231
00:08:56,570 --> 00:08:58,970
bit upset if they went to if they have

232
00:08:58,970 --> 00:09:00,350
to touch the screen to use our

233
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:02,660
calculator so focusable should always

234
00:09:02,660 --> 00:09:04,370
certainly be set for this widget this is

235
00:09:04,370 --> 00:09:05,540
the new number which it

236
00:09:05,540 --> 00:09:09,110
and I've also decided to allow numbers

237
00:09:09,110 --> 00:09:11,450
to be entered using a soft keyboard that

238
00:09:11,450 --> 00:09:13,760
way a user can use its backspace key to

239
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:15,530
prove to correct typing errors if they

240
00:09:15,530 --> 00:09:17,210
want to so I'm also going to leave

241
00:09:17,210 --> 00:09:18,020
focusable

242
00:09:18,020 --> 00:09:21,110
and focusable in touch mode unchanged

243
00:09:21,110 --> 00:09:23,330
for this widget and if you don't want to

244
00:09:23,330 --> 00:09:24,740
allow the on-screen keyboard to be used

245
00:09:24,740 --> 00:09:28,130
you know how to disable it all right now

246
00:09:28,130 --> 00:09:29,870
we just need to line up the buttons so

247
00:09:29,870 --> 00:09:32,630
to do that what we need to do is delete

248
00:09:32,630 --> 00:09:35,660
the left constraint for button 7 then

249
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:38,030
set it to the left edge of new number

250
00:09:38,030 --> 00:09:40,220
instead so I'm gonna come over here

251
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:42,230
we've got this constraint for number 7

252
00:09:42,230 --> 00:09:45,050
our digit 7 and just go back to our

253
00:09:45,050 --> 00:09:46,520
normal mode there we can see that we've

254
00:09:46,520 --> 00:09:47,930
got the left constraint which is the

255
00:09:47,930 --> 00:09:50,780
left screen left of the layer so I'm

256
00:09:50,780 --> 00:09:53,390
going to delete that and then now what

257
00:09:53,390 --> 00:09:56,060
we want to do is set the left constraint

258
00:09:56,060 --> 00:09:57,740
to be the left edge of new number

259
00:09:57,740 --> 00:10:01,390
instead so let's go ahead and do that

260
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:03,119
like so

261
00:10:03,119 --> 00:10:05,219
and the other thing we want to do is

262
00:10:05,219 --> 00:10:07,529
make sure that we change the margin the

263
00:10:07,529 --> 00:10:10,649
left margin now for button seven to zero

264
00:10:10,649 --> 00:10:11,609
I'm going to go ahead and do that

265
00:10:11,609 --> 00:10:13,289
otherwise it's going to be little bit

266
00:10:13,289 --> 00:10:15,419
off you can see know that it's fitting

267
00:10:15,419 --> 00:10:18,179
in quite nicely now for this particular

268
00:10:18,179 --> 00:10:20,879
layout that's all we need to do we

269
00:10:20,879 --> 00:10:22,769
haven't really centered the button array

270
00:10:22,769 --> 00:10:24,809
but assets constrain to something that

271
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:27,299
is centered and it is the same width

272
00:10:27,299 --> 00:10:30,259
it all works fine now if I switch the

273
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:32,969
layout to landscape it will still look

274
00:10:32,969 --> 00:10:33,539
forward

275
00:10:33,539 --> 00:10:35,339
well foreign horizontally it's not as

276
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:36,749
good vertically but we'll come back to

277
00:10:36,749 --> 00:10:39,899
that later and again just to having us

278
00:10:39,899 --> 00:10:41,219
having a look to see what this looks

279
00:10:41,219 --> 00:10:42,899
like and come up here and switch to

280
00:10:42,899 --> 00:10:46,259
landscape they can see that it does

281
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:48,899
still look okay well I guess it I guess

282
00:10:48,899 --> 00:10:50,669
to be fair fine horizontally as I

283
00:10:50,669 --> 00:10:52,169
mentioned - not so good vertically I

284
00:10:52,169 --> 00:10:53,699
will actually come back to that I

285
00:10:53,699 --> 00:10:58,379
totally go back to to portrait again we

286
00:10:58,379 --> 00:10:59,909
haven't centered the array of buttons as

287
00:10:59,909 --> 00:11:01,889
I've said there because we've only got

288
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:04,409
four buttons across it works fine but if

289
00:11:04,409 --> 00:11:06,179
we added more columns of buttons then it

290
00:11:06,179 --> 00:11:07,589
wouldn't be centered any longer

291
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:09,209
I'm going to come back to that at the

292
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:10,559
end of this section and look at how to

293
00:11:10,559 --> 00:11:13,289
Center groups of widgets now though

294
00:11:13,289 --> 00:11:14,579
there's just one more thing I want to

295
00:11:14,579 --> 00:11:16,289
discuss before we move on to writing the

296
00:11:16,289 --> 00:11:19,199
code for the calculator now in the

297
00:11:19,199 --> 00:11:21,149
previous videos we remove the text from

298
00:11:21,149 --> 00:11:23,939
the textview in code it's easy to do as

299
00:11:23,939 --> 00:11:25,859
you saw and it's often a good idea to

300
00:11:25,859 --> 00:11:28,529
leave text in the layout but in this one

301
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:30,719
I'm going to clear the text in operation

302
00:11:30,719 --> 00:11:32,909
then try to change its vertical

303
00:11:32,909 --> 00:11:35,129
constraint so it's aligned on its

304
00:11:35,129 --> 00:11:36,869
baseline it does look a little bit

305
00:11:36,869 --> 00:11:39,089
higher when the line to the top there so

306
00:11:39,089 --> 00:11:40,679
I'm going to come over here to our text

307
00:11:40,679 --> 00:11:44,639
view this is there for our operation

308
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:46,979
widget we're going to delete the text as

309
00:11:46,979 --> 00:11:52,349
I mentioned and you can see that once I

310
00:11:52,349 --> 00:11:54,299
press the Enter there and what the same

311
00:11:54,299 --> 00:11:55,649
thing would happen if I clicked back in

312
00:11:55,649 --> 00:11:58,019
the design in the design or blueprint

313
00:11:58,019 --> 00:11:59,729
the widget shrinks and that's because

314
00:11:59,729 --> 00:12:01,649
it's set to wrap underscore content in

315
00:12:01,649 --> 00:12:04,289
fact there isn't any content so I'm

316
00:12:04,289 --> 00:12:06,119
going to start by deleting the vertical

317
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:10,109
vertical constraint and you can see that

318
00:12:10,109 --> 00:12:11,519
it's disappeared from the inspector at

319
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:13,319
the right and I could have deleted it

320
00:12:13,319 --> 00:12:14,039
from there as well

321
00:12:14,039 --> 00:12:16,800
in fact now the widgets so small

322
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:18,869
it's probably easier to use the

323
00:12:18,869 --> 00:12:21,509
inspector to delete the constraints but

324
00:12:21,509 --> 00:12:23,579
creating the baseline constraint that we

325
00:12:23,579 --> 00:12:26,059
won't know is just about impossible and

326
00:12:26,059 --> 00:12:28,829
it is possible it's pretty hard to try

327
00:12:28,829 --> 00:12:30,809
and get over to there and get to touch

328
00:12:30,809 --> 00:12:34,110
the the baseline button there which of

329
00:12:34,110 --> 00:12:36,389
course makes the handle appear now I

330
00:12:36,389 --> 00:12:38,670
could resize the widget or put some text

331
00:12:38,670 --> 00:12:40,829
in temporarily to make it wide enough

332
00:12:40,829 --> 00:12:43,470
where I could even edit the XML there is

333
00:12:43,470 --> 00:12:45,019
another way though it's not necessarily

334
00:12:45,019 --> 00:12:46,949
easier than putting some text in

335
00:12:46,949 --> 00:12:48,600
temporarily but it's useful to know

336
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:49,339
about it

337
00:12:49,339 --> 00:12:51,989
now the constraints appear in the

338
00:12:51,989 --> 00:12:54,149
attributes so I can expand the

339
00:12:54,149 --> 00:12:55,860
attributes using the double arrows I've

340
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:58,799
been using been doing in the course and

341
00:12:58,799 --> 00:13:00,389
then I can expand I'll go back up to the

342
00:13:00,389 --> 00:13:02,970
top of the list I can expand constraints

343
00:13:02,970 --> 00:13:03,920
as you can see here

344
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:05,699
you remember that the list is

345
00:13:05,699 --> 00:13:07,829
alphabetical but properties that have

346
00:13:07,829 --> 00:13:09,389
been used to shuffle to the top of the

347
00:13:09,389 --> 00:13:13,019
list so so may help if I make this still

348
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:14,699
a little bit wider so that we can see

349
00:13:14,699 --> 00:13:16,949
the names of all of these basically the

350
00:13:16,949 --> 00:13:19,379
full names of each constraint the one we

351
00:13:19,379 --> 00:13:21,600
want is the baseline I'll escort to

352
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:24,149
baseline off this one here baseline now

353
00:13:24,149 --> 00:13:27,119
let's go to baseline to baseline off now

354
00:13:27,119 --> 00:13:29,100
the names are very descriptive so and we

355
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,299
can see the constraints that we've

356
00:13:30,299 --> 00:13:32,819
already set so the left one start is set

357
00:13:32,819 --> 00:13:34,920
to the left of the layout this one here

358
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,249
start step two parent the right one end

359
00:13:38,249 --> 00:13:40,049
was constraint to the left of the new

360
00:13:40,049 --> 00:13:41,850
number as you can see up here now we

361
00:13:41,850 --> 00:13:43,529
want the light we want to line the

362
00:13:43,529 --> 00:13:46,769
baseline of the textview to the baseline

363
00:13:46,769 --> 00:13:48,779
of new number so you could just put it

364
00:13:48,779 --> 00:13:51,540
ID you know ampersand + ID / new number

365
00:13:51,540 --> 00:13:53,939
as - widget to constrain the baseline -

366
00:13:53,939 --> 00:13:56,490
and even easier you just select new

367
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:01,939
number from the list so come over here

368
00:14:01,939 --> 00:14:04,980
select new number and you can see

369
00:14:04,980 --> 00:14:07,619
immediately the alignment actually

370
00:14:07,619 --> 00:14:09,209
kicked in straightaway and we saw that

371
00:14:09,209 --> 00:14:11,999
being drawn up on the screen so the two

372
00:14:11,999 --> 00:14:13,319
new widgets have been added to the

373
00:14:13,319 --> 00:14:14,730
bottom of the component tree by the way

374
00:14:14,730 --> 00:14:15,749
so I'm going to come back over here and

375
00:14:15,749 --> 00:14:21,830
make it more space

376
00:14:21,830 --> 00:14:24,750
so going to drag them up to so they

377
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:26,520
appear in the list in the order matching

378
00:14:26,520 --> 00:14:28,350
the placement in the layout that should

379
00:14:28,350 --> 00:14:36,540
really be result operation and then you

380
00:14:36,540 --> 00:14:42,000
number like so so go back into the

381
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,220
landscape now just have a bit of a look

382
00:14:46,220 --> 00:14:49,080
you can see that the buttons are far too

383
00:14:49,080 --> 00:14:50,540
close to the bottom of the screen

384
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:52,950
there's a fair bit of space between the

385
00:14:52,950 --> 00:14:55,170
widgets vertically so he could start

386
00:14:55,170 --> 00:14:57,030
shuffling them up by reducing their top

387
00:14:57,030 --> 00:14:59,340
margins now sometimes you may have to do

388
00:14:59,340 --> 00:15:00,810
that but to Android's got another

389
00:15:00,810 --> 00:15:03,390
solution and it's possible to create

390
00:15:03,390 --> 00:15:05,160
separate layouts for different screen

391
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:07,620
sizes and landscape counts as a

392
00:15:07,620 --> 00:15:10,350
different screen size to portrait all

393
00:15:10,350 --> 00:15:12,420
right so let's finish the video here now

394
00:15:12,420 --> 00:15:14,190
that we've identified that these buttons

395
00:15:14,190 --> 00:15:16,290
are too close in the next video we'll

396
00:15:16,290 --> 00:15:17,550
spend a bit of time fixing that problem

397
00:15:17,550 --> 00:15:19,650
so that things look right for this

398
00:15:19,650 --> 00:15:22,410
interface both in portrait and landscape

399
00:15:22,410 --> 00:15:26,390
mode so I'll see you in the next video
