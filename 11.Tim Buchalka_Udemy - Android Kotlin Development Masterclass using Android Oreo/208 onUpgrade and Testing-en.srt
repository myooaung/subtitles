1
00:00:04,660 --> 00:00:07,000
all right so moving on now we're going

2
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,160
to talk about on upgrade the function

3
00:00:09,160 --> 00:00:11,500
and also some testing so the other

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:12,760
function we had to implement if you

5
00:00:12,760 --> 00:00:14,980
recall to our out in our web database

6
00:00:14,980 --> 00:00:18,640
our class was on upgrade and if we take

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,480
a look at that looking at the

8
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,500
documentation let's scroll this up so

9
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:29,619
you can see it it gets past the version

10
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:32,020
of the database that Android finds so

11
00:00:32,020 --> 00:00:33,460
the documentation explains that this

12
00:00:33,460 --> 00:00:35,110
function is called where the database

13
00:00:35,110 --> 00:00:37,150
needs to be upgraded

14
00:00:37,150 --> 00:00:39,400
now wouldn't be a functions called it

15
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:41,320
gets passed the version of the database

16
00:00:41,320 --> 00:00:43,930
that Android finds and the current

17
00:00:43,930 --> 00:00:46,420
version so we passed the current version

18
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:48,490
number into the super method in the

19
00:00:48,490 --> 00:00:50,800
constructor so the sequel Lite open

20
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,900
helper class can track the versions for

21
00:00:52,900 --> 00:00:54,940
us you know reverse these are starting

22
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,130
out so this is version 1 so there's

23
00:00:57,130 --> 00:00:58,930
nothing to upgrade we'll be adding some

24
00:00:58,930 --> 00:01:00,670
more tables and views as we develop the

25
00:01:00,670 --> 00:01:02,500
app so I'm going to be discussing the on

26
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,869
upgrade function in more detail when

27
00:01:04,869 --> 00:01:05,920
we've actually going to upgrade to

28
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:07,780
perform for know that what we're going

29
00:01:07,780 --> 00:01:09,009
to do is we're just kind of add some

30
00:01:09,009 --> 00:01:13,840
dummy code and some logging all right so

31
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:16,210
going to start with some logging hooked

32
00:01:16,210 --> 00:01:18,789
up d parentheses ter comma double quotes

33
00:01:18,789 --> 00:01:27,609
on upgrade colon starts all right and

34
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:30,280
we're going to type when in parentheses

35
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:34,539
old version then open the code block and

36
00:01:34,539 --> 00:01:37,149
then we have type 1 - greater than sign

37
00:01:37,149 --> 00:01:39,999
and code block and that's going to put a

38
00:01:39,999 --> 00:01:43,030
comment in there upgrade logic from

39
00:01:43,030 --> 00:01:46,389
version 1 and outside of that what we're

40
00:01:46,389 --> 00:01:48,939
going to do is do an else that's greater

41
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:51,999
than and we're going to a throw a legal

42
00:01:51,999 --> 00:01:55,600
state exception in the parentheses an

43
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,999
upgrade parentheses in double quotes

44
00:01:57,999 --> 00:02:04,810
with unknown new version colon space and

45
00:02:04,810 --> 00:02:06,899
that's going to be dollar new version

46
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:09,729
alright now we can create a new instance

47
00:02:09,729 --> 00:02:12,400
of our app database class in main

48
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:14,680
activities on create method and request

49
00:02:14,680 --> 00:02:16,300
the database connection to test that it

50
00:02:16,300 --> 00:02:19,500
works so let's go back to our main actor

51
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,000
and specifically the uncreate method

52
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,670
we're going to do just that so I'm going

53
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:27,040
to start talking this code below the set

54
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:30,160
to support action bar give it a space

55
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,500
there so I'm going to start talking now

56
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:38,800
epic database equals epic database dot

57
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:41,910
get instance then this in parenthesis

58
00:02:41,910 --> 00:02:45,880
then we're going to type Val DB equals F

59
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:51,340
database dot readable database then next

60
00:02:51,340 --> 00:02:54,700
line Val cursor is equal to DB or or

61
00:02:54,700 --> 00:02:56,920
query and in parentheses I'm going to

62
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:04,060
type select star from tasks comma then

63
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:06,640
oh that's the second argument then I can

64
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,050
do a log table T parenthesis tag comma

65
00:03:11,050 --> 00:03:12,280
and what's going to do a series of

66
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,230
asterisks is there and I'm gonna take

67
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:20,260
the opportunity now to add our tag the

68
00:03:20,260 --> 00:03:24,370
style files are private Const Val tag

69
00:03:24,370 --> 00:03:29,320
equals mainactivity okay and then below

70
00:03:29,320 --> 00:03:32,130
the log entry we're going to do cursor

71
00:03:32,130 --> 00:03:36,280
don't use open a code block and then

72
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:37,270
we're going to type on the next line

73
00:03:37,270 --> 00:03:43,530
while parentheses i teed up move to next

74
00:03:43,530 --> 00:03:46,930
another code block in a comment here

75
00:03:46,930 --> 00:03:48,360
they were going to cycle through all

76
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:54,990
records and they're going to type with

77
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:59,410
parentheses cursor opening in another

78
00:03:59,410 --> 00:04:01,930
code block and type Val I D equals get

79
00:04:01,930 --> 00:04:06,730
long zero in parenthesis and val name is

80
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,980
equal to get string one in parenthesis

81
00:04:10,980 --> 00:04:16,870
thou description equals get string 2 in

82
00:04:16,870 --> 00:04:20,560
parentheses and then sort order Val sort

83
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,750
order equals get string 3 in parenthesis

84
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:28,510
and I'm going to type the result is

85
00:04:28,510 --> 00:04:32,469
equal to in double quotes ID

86
00:04:32,469 --> 00:04:38,169
space and Donna ID . and name : spaced

87
00:04:38,169 --> 00:04:40,389
on the name then I'm gonna go space

88
00:04:40,389 --> 00:04:45,340
there then description : dollar

89
00:04:45,340 --> 00:04:51,219
description in sort order : dollar sort

90
00:04:51,219 --> 00:04:54,219
order then we never add another lock

91
00:04:54,219 --> 00:04:57,629
there so lock d parentheses ter comma

92
00:04:57,629 --> 00:05:03,249
there's nobody on create reading data

93
00:05:03,249 --> 00:05:07,870
dollar result and then finally what I'm

94
00:05:07,870 --> 00:05:10,060
going to do is take a copy of this these

95
00:05:10,060 --> 00:05:11,979
Astrix a--'s and I'm going to add that

96
00:05:11,979 --> 00:05:15,449
just above the Fabiano click list of it

97
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:18,129
alright so what is this code doing well

98
00:05:18,129 --> 00:05:19,689
after getting an instance of up database

99
00:05:19,689 --> 00:05:22,210
we run a query and log the task details

100
00:05:22,210 --> 00:05:24,249
this is very similar to the code we've

101
00:05:24,249 --> 00:05:26,319
seen previously we won't be performing

102
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,659
queries like this in the upload this is

103
00:05:28,659 --> 00:05:30,550
just a test that our web database class

104
00:05:30,550 --> 00:05:33,580
is behaving as it should now I've added

105
00:05:33,580 --> 00:05:35,169
a row of asterisks is as you saw there

106
00:05:35,169 --> 00:05:37,180
before and after our data because the

107
00:05:37,180 --> 00:05:39,069
new lock cap makes it harder to spawn

108
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,039
our data alright so now let's run our

109
00:05:42,039 --> 00:05:43,810
application so I'm going to click on the

110
00:05:43,810 --> 00:05:47,649
button to starlet and we're going to

111
00:05:47,649 --> 00:05:50,469
open a lock at just so we can take a

112
00:05:50,469 --> 00:05:52,779
look and see what's happened so firstly

113
00:05:52,779 --> 00:05:54,669
the get instance function returns a new

114
00:05:54,669 --> 00:05:56,289
instance of our singleton app database

115
00:05:56,289 --> 00:05:58,360
class and we can see the constructor

116
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,839
being called appear we've got our app

117
00:06:01,839 --> 00:06:03,460
database initializing on the next line

118
00:06:03,460 --> 00:06:06,490
and then on create starting and if you

119
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:09,339
recall on create that function is called

120
00:06:09,339 --> 00:06:10,479
for us because the android framework

121
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,310
detects that the database doesn't

122
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:14,800
already exist so uncreate was called as

123
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:16,300
we can see there and there's our siegel

124
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,479
code that's the code that creates the

125
00:06:19,479 --> 00:06:21,610
database when that on create two

126
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,469
functions called for us because the

127
00:06:23,469 --> 00:06:25,779
android framework detected that the

128
00:06:25,779 --> 00:06:28,060
database didn't already exist so so far

129
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,339
so good this is really showing us what

130
00:06:30,339 --> 00:06:33,069
we expected to be show on or in other

131
00:06:33,069 --> 00:06:34,870
words the functionalities working as

132
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:36,909
expected but what we want to do now is

133
00:06:36,909 --> 00:06:38,409
check that the database really was

134
00:06:38,409 --> 00:06:41,529
created and does in fact contain our

135
00:06:41,529 --> 00:06:43,839
tasks table so what we're going to do

136
00:06:43,839 --> 00:06:45,550
now is close a look at

137
00:06:45,550 --> 00:06:48,610
I'm going to open terminal we're going

138
00:06:48,610 --> 00:06:50,140
to have a look at the database on the

139
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:52,450
emulator so gonna start by topping adb

140
00:06:52,450 --> 00:06:57,190
devices now most of the time when you do

141
00:06:57,190 --> 00:06:59,170
that you'll only have a single device

142
00:06:59,170 --> 00:07:01,420
showing here but I've got an emulator

143
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,540
and my oneplus Android phone connected

144
00:07:04,540 --> 00:07:06,640
and I've done it that way just so you

145
00:07:06,640 --> 00:07:09,130
can see how to use adb shell when

146
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:10,470
there's more than one device available

147
00:07:10,470 --> 00:07:12,730
but you'll get an error if you try to

148
00:07:12,730 --> 00:07:14,650
use adb commands with more than one

149
00:07:14,650 --> 00:07:17,170
device connected to the computer whether

150
00:07:17,170 --> 00:07:19,020
they're emulators or physical devices

151
00:07:19,020 --> 00:07:22,150
now the reason for the error is that ADB

152
00:07:22,150 --> 00:07:24,520
doesn't know which device you want to

153
00:07:24,520 --> 00:07:26,950
use if there's only one it doesn't have

154
00:07:26,950 --> 00:07:28,480
a problem but if you've got more than

155
00:07:28,480 --> 00:07:30,730
one then you have to specify which

156
00:07:30,730 --> 00:07:33,460
device you want to use we do that with

157
00:07:33,460 --> 00:07:36,790
the - s switch so my emulator is showing

158
00:07:36,790 --> 00:07:39,820
up as emulator - triple v 4 so the

159
00:07:39,820 --> 00:07:42,340
command I need to type here is a TB

160
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:50,040
space - yes space emulator - triple v 4

161
00:07:50,040 --> 00:07:54,550
space shell so basically you can see

162
00:07:54,550 --> 00:07:56,830
that's connected now to the emulator and

163
00:07:56,830 --> 00:07:58,000
whenever you've got more than one device

164
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,270
connected just use - yes and the device

165
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:01,420
ID

166
00:08:01,420 --> 00:08:04,210
immediately after ADB and which

167
00:08:04,210 --> 00:08:05,890
specifies which device should be used

168
00:08:05,890 --> 00:08:08,140
all right so we connected now to shell

169
00:08:08,140 --> 00:08:11,980
on our emulator so let's top this you we

170
00:08:11,980 --> 00:08:14,740
need that to super user mode and that

171
00:08:14,740 --> 00:08:16,180
probably won't work if you're using a

172
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:18,520
physical device unless you've got root

173
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:20,740
access and you've also installed the SU

174
00:08:20,740 --> 00:08:23,080
command so if you're testing this app on

175
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,900
a physical device you'll probably have

176
00:08:25,900 --> 00:08:27,850
to skip this step but don't worry they

177
00:08:27,850 --> 00:08:28,780
were already confirming that the

178
00:08:28,780 --> 00:08:31,150
database has been created if it hadn't

179
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:32,980
been then we would have seen errors in

180
00:08:32,980 --> 00:08:35,170
the locker you know we saw in an earlier

181
00:08:35,170 --> 00:08:37,720
video that the database so the databases

182
00:08:37,720 --> 00:08:39,940
are created in the apps directory in

183
00:08:39,940 --> 00:08:42,460
slash data / dat are in a database

184
00:08:42,460 --> 00:08:44,590
directory so make a note of your package

185
00:08:44,590 --> 00:08:46,510
name because that's also the name of the

186
00:08:46,510 --> 00:08:48,550
apps home directory if you are using a

187
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:50,590
different package name to me in my case

188
00:08:50,590 --> 00:08:52,810
I'm going to type CD slash data that's a

189
00:08:52,810 --> 00:08:55,630
forward slash slash data again that's

190
00:08:55,630 --> 00:08:57,490
going to be learn programming to McAlary

191
00:08:57,490 --> 00:08:58,880
that task trauma

192
00:08:58,880 --> 00:08:59,990
you can see that coming up automatically

193
00:08:59,990 --> 00:09:02,540
when I clicked when I press tab and I'm

194
00:09:02,540 --> 00:09:05,240
gonna go into databases alright so now

195
00:09:05,240 --> 00:09:06,770
that I've done that in the top sequel

196
00:09:06,770 --> 00:09:12,740
like three tasks timer drop DB and then

197
00:09:12,740 --> 00:09:16,670
I'm going to type dot schemer and

198
00:09:16,670 --> 00:09:19,190
there's our tasks table now remember

199
00:09:19,190 --> 00:09:21,320
that Android is a Linux operating system

200
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:23,270
and the file and directory names are

201
00:09:23,270 --> 00:09:25,820
case sensitive so if your task time a

202
00:09:25,820 --> 00:09:27,290
database didn't open

203
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,540
make sure you've used the correct case

204
00:09:29,540 --> 00:09:31,880
for the name now this should be exactly

205
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:33,740
the same as the database underscore name

206
00:09:33,740 --> 00:09:36,800
field in the up database class now while

207
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:38,150
we're here I'm going to add some records

208
00:09:38,150 --> 00:09:39,950
in the database now we're going to write

209
00:09:39,950 --> 00:09:41,870
the code to display the tasks before the

210
00:09:41,870 --> 00:09:44,060
code to add them so these sample rows

211
00:09:44,060 --> 00:09:45,860
will let us see that the display codes

212
00:09:45,860 --> 00:09:47,720
working when we get to that point in

213
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:49,760
development so I'm going to type part

214
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:55,340
insert into tasks parenthesis now come a

215
00:09:55,340 --> 00:10:01,520
description in values parentheses task

216
00:10:01,520 --> 00:10:03,440
timer and single quotes comma single

217
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,420
quote for task timer app creation and

218
00:10:08,420 --> 00:10:10,070
close off the single quote right

219
00:10:10,070 --> 00:10:13,010
parenthesis and semicolon then next one

220
00:10:13,010 --> 00:10:15,880
we'll do insert into tasks again

221
00:10:15,880 --> 00:10:18,010
parentheses it's gonna be name

222
00:10:18,010 --> 00:10:22,280
description in sort order separated by

223
00:10:22,280 --> 00:10:24,500
commas and another parentheses to close

224
00:10:24,500 --> 00:10:26,800
it off the right one then in values

225
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,120
parentheses we're going to go with

226
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:33,140
Android Java you can single quotes comma

227
00:10:33,140 --> 00:10:37,480
single quotes again Android Java course

228
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:40,520
single quote comma two right parenthesis

229
00:10:40,520 --> 00:10:43,760
and semicolon alright the third I'm

230
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:46,990
going to type insert into tasks

231
00:10:46,990 --> 00:10:50,680
parenthesis name comma description comma

232
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:54,790
and sort order cover right parenthesis

233
00:10:54,790 --> 00:10:58,850
values in parentheses again there's some

234
00:10:58,850 --> 00:11:02,960
on top Android Colin and I'm gonna top

235
00:11:02,960 --> 00:11:07,339
android Coughlin course which of course

236
00:11:07,339 --> 00:11:10,100
is this one comma zero right parenthesis

237
00:11:10,100 --> 00:11:11,070
and

238
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:14,850
: then you do a search star and tasks to

239
00:11:14,850 --> 00:11:17,400
make sure that the records are there you

240
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:19,290
can see the records are there so at this

241
00:11:19,290 --> 00:11:21,480
point our database is looking fine so

242
00:11:21,480 --> 00:11:22,530
we're going to quit sequel light by

243
00:11:22,530 --> 00:11:26,160
typing directs it then we going to leave

244
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:28,320
CP is a mode by typing exit without the

245
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,450
doctor's time then we're going to log

246
00:11:30,450 --> 00:11:31,830
out at the Android sure by typing it

247
00:11:31,830 --> 00:11:35,840
once more look at our exit one more time

248
00:11:35,840 --> 00:11:39,090
and that closes the terminal window all

249
00:11:39,090 --> 00:11:40,410
right so now there's some data in the

250
00:11:40,410 --> 00:11:42,630
database we should see it logged in the

251
00:11:42,630 --> 00:11:45,030
logcat when we run the up again so let's

252
00:11:45,030 --> 00:11:46,920
go and try running that and see that it

253
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:54,690
works well open look at all right so

254
00:11:54,690 --> 00:11:56,280
that's looking good our web database

255
00:11:56,280 --> 00:11:58,500
class created the database and is now

256
00:11:58,500 --> 00:12:00,210
providing a database connection that we

257
00:12:00,210 --> 00:12:02,850
can use we've now got the tasks contract

258
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:05,430
and app database classes working the

259
00:12:05,430 --> 00:12:07,290
next step is to create the content

260
00:12:07,290 --> 00:12:09,660
provider that we use to access the data

261
00:12:09,660 --> 00:12:11,790
in the database and we'll start work on

262
00:12:11,790 --> 00:12:14,960
that in the next video
