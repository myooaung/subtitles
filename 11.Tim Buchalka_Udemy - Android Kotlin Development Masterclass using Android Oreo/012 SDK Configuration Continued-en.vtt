00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.350

In the last video we left the various



2

00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.330

components of the SDK downloading the



3

00:00:09.330 --> 00:00:11.190

sources for Android 26 and the two



4

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.430

images for the emulators you see now



5

00:00:14.430 --> 00:00:15.570

that that's finished I'm going to click



6

00:00:15.570 --> 00:00:18.539

on finish there and what we want to do



7

00:00:18.539 --> 00:00:22.349

now we need to start looking at the SDK



8

00:00:22.349 --> 00:00:24.119

tools tab, we'll come up here and click on



9

00:00:24.119 --> 00:00:26.910

SDK tools and next come down here and



10

00:00:26.910 --> 00:00:28.439

click on show package details by



11

00:00:28.439 --> 00:00:31.529

checking the checkbox. Now quite a lot of



12

00:00:31.529 --> 00:00:34.020

stuff in this error is obsolete and you



13

00:00:34.020 --> 00:00:35.460

certainly wouldn't want to install those



14

00:00:35.460 --> 00:00:37.770

without a very good reason so most of



15

00:00:37.770 --> 00:00:39.150

what we want should already be installed



16

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.060

but there may well be updates available



17

00:00:41.060 --> 00:00:43.800

so check the rightmost column to see if



18

00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:45.720

any components are showing us updates.



19

00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:48.360

most likely there won't be initially if



20

00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:50.670

you've just installed Android studio but



21

00:00:50.670 --> 00:00:52.470

if you come back later you'll find that



22

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:54.390

then what most likely will be updates



23

00:00:54.390 --> 00:00:56.550

over time and if updates are available



24

00:00:56.550 --> 00:00:58.170

just make sure they're selected then



25

00:00:58.170 --> 00:00:59.910

click apply to them to install them



26

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:02.700

before we add anything else but we have



27

00:01:02.700 --> 00:01:04.439

a look down here the lists now we can



28

00:01:04.439 --> 00:01:06.360

see that we've got not installer



29

00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:07.770

installed there's nothing that says that



30

00:01:07.770 --> 00:01:10.020

there's an update. Now first if you



31

00:01:10.020 --> 00:01:11.700

scroll down a little bit in this section



32

00:01:11.700 --> 00:01:15.000

here the Android SDK build tools we want



33

00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.500

the highest version available and



34

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:18.570

they'll always appear at the bottom of



35

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:21.750

the list you can see 27.0.1 the



36

00:01:21.750 --> 00:01:24.060

latest and highest number is installed



37

00:01:24.060 --> 00:01:25.820

that's the latest version in other words



38

00:01:25.820 --> 00:01:28.020

now if you've got a new or a later



39

00:01:28.020 --> 00:01:29.610

version available than that then choose



40

00:01:29.610 --> 00:01:31.950

that one instead and it should already



41

00:01:31.950 --> 00:01:33.120

be installed if you've just installed



42

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.490

Android studio in any event. Now while we



43

00:01:35.490 --> 00:01:36.990

were testing this we had some problems



44

00:01:36.990 --> 00:01:39.930

with creating new projects now I'm not



45

00:01:39.930 --> 00:01:41.250

going to go into all the details I said



46

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:42.810

probably won't make a lot of sense at



47

00:01:42.810 --> 00:01:44.820

the moment but essentially Android



48

00:01:44.820 --> 00:01:47.549

studio was selling the project API 226



49

00:01:47.549 --> 00:01:50.159

so that means it needs the latest SDK



50

00:01:50.159 --> 00:01:52.530

build tools in this case you can see



51

00:01:52.530 --> 00:01:54.870

it's twenty six point zero point three,



52

00:01:54.870 --> 00:01:57.780

so I'm going to select that also just to



53

00:01:57.780 --> 00:01:59.460

make sure that we've got that selected



54

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:00.900

and ticked so that it's going to be



55

00:02:00.900 --> 00:02:03.690

downloaded and again we don't need to do



56

00:02:03.690 --> 00:02:05.130

anything with the latest version there



57

00:02:05.130 --> 00:02:06.390

because that was already installed for



58

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.479

us now Google had fired separated the



59

00:02:09.479 --> 00:02:11.610

Android emulator from the rest of the



60

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:13.829

platform tools so consequently we want



61

00:02:13.829 --> 00:02:15.180

to make sure that it's our few things



62

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:16.920

are checked and if we scroll down and



63

00:02:16.920 --> 00:02:18.360

have a look here.



64

00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:20.700

So you've got Android emulator, Android



65

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.020

SDK platform tools and Android SDK tools



66

00:02:24.020 --> 00:02:26.400

now those three should all be checked



67

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:28.140

which they are and they should all be



68

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.970

installed so you'd check those if they



69

00:02:29.970 --> 00:02:31.890

aren't installed but on a new



70

00:02:31.890 --> 00:02:33.360

installation of Android studio you



71

00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:35.760

should find they were installed now the



72

00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.770

documentation for Android SDK is



73

00:02:37.770 --> 00:02:40.110

extremely useful and probably won't



74

00:02:40.110 --> 00:02:41.580

already be installed and you can see in



75

00:02:41.580 --> 00:02:43.740

my case it's not installed so I



76

00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.600

definitely recommend taking that one so



77

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.370

let's do that, documentation for Android



78

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:49.830

studio. Now the next one we want is



79

00:02:49.830 --> 00:02:52.709

Google Play services and that's this one



80

00:02:52.709 --> 00:02:54.780

here you can play services as you can



81

00:02:54.780 --> 00:02:56.700

see that's currently not installed so



82

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:59.010

I'm going to select that as well now



83

00:02:59.010 --> 00:03:01.680

below that there's a Google USB driver



84

00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:04.470

you'll need that on Windows and actually



85

00:03:04.470 --> 00:03:05.730

it won't appear on Linux and Mac



86

00:03:05.730 --> 00:03:08.010

computers and I'm recording this video



87

00:03:08.010 --> 00:03:09.780

on a Mac so you can see that I haven't



88

00:03:09.780 --> 00:03:11.400

got that in my list but if you're on a



89

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.380

Windows machine do make sure you select



90

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:16.739

the Google USB Driver otherwise you'll



91

00:03:16.739 --> 00:03:18.150

have problems connecting your phone to



92

00:03:18.150 --> 00:03:20.730

Android studi, now so we scroll down a



93

00:03:20.730 --> 00:03:23.370

little bit more on Windows and Mac



94

00:03:23.370 --> 00:03:25.920

computers the intel x86 emulator



95

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:28.890

accelerator hacks them down here should



96

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:30.480

probably be ticked already you can see



97

00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:32.190

in my case it is ticked and marked or



98

00:03:32.190 --> 00:03:34.920

since s is installed now if you had



99

00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:37.200

problems installing xml earlier and



100

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.690

it's probably worth ticking it here that



101

00:03:39.690 --> 00:03:42.209

way you can run the installer again now



102

00:03:42.209 --> 00:03:44.250

if you manage to get VTX working in your



103

00:03:44.250 --> 00:03:46.799

BIOS that is and there's a video in this



104

00:03:46.799 --> 00:03:48.239

section of the course that explains that



105

00:03:48.239 --> 00:03:50.670

if you did have problems with hexam so



106

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:51.750

after that as we scroll down a little



107

00:03:51.750 --> 00:03:53.370

bit more this is big section down here



108

00:03:53.370 --> 00:03:55.320

showing all sorts of versions of the



109

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:57.540

constraint layout library and there's



110

00:03:57.540 --> 00:03:59.160

two parts to this there's the constraint



111

00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.290

layout and also the solver for



112

00:04:01.290 --> 00:04:03.810

constraint layout now we're going to be



113

00:04:03.810 --> 00:04:05.220

using the constraint layout when



114

00:04:05.220 --> 00:04:07.140

designing our app screens so we



115

00:04:07.140 --> 00:04:09.570

certainly want to install this unless I



116

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:11.250

record this the latest version is one



117

00:04:11.250 --> 00:04:14.060

point at 0.2 so I'm going to select that



118

00:04:14.060 --> 00:04:17.130

so make sure you tick that one point 0.2



119

00:04:17.130 --> 00:04:19.019

or whatever is the latest version for



120

00:04:19.019 --> 00:04:20.640

both the constraint layout for Android



121

00:04:20.640 --> 00:04:22.620

as well as the solver for constraint



122

00:04:22.620 --> 00:04:24.210

layout, so I'll scroll that down there's



123

00:04:24.210 --> 00:04:26.729

a one point 0.2 there so clicking there



124

00:04:26.729 --> 00:04:28.650

as well again we're doing that if



125

00:04:28.650 --> 00:04:30.570

they're not already installed in we can



126

00:04:30.570 --> 00:04:31.830

see here that they and they



127

00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:33.530

actually installed in this point in time.



128

00:04:33.530 --> 00:04:35.940

Now the final two options at the bottom



129

00:04:35.940 --> 00:04:37.830

of the screen should already be selected



130

00:04:37.830 --> 00:04:39.720

and you can see the layer selected and



131

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:42.060

they have been installed already. Now if



132

00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:43.800

they're not for any reason checked you



133

00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.780

do want android support repository and



134

00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:48.480

Google repository now if any of these



135

00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:50.160

aren't available when you come to



136

00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.440

install the components don't worry about it



137

00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.390

and that's because Google changed things



138

00:04:54.390 --> 00:04:56.460

a lot and you may find things like the



139

00:04:56.460 --> 00:04:58.800

Google repository being included in the



140

00:04:58.800 --> 00:05:00.780

android support repository for example



141

00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:02.400

so install the ones that I've mentioned



142

00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:05.310

and carry on if any don't exist alright



143

00:05:05.310 --> 00:05:06.930

so at this point you've got everything



144

00:05:06.930 --> 00:05:09.840

selected we can click on apply we get a



145

00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:11.190

list of what's going to install I'm



146

00:05:11.190 --> 00:05:13.280

going to click ok and that's before



147

00:05:13.280 --> 00:05:15.630

Google the Android studio it's going to



148

00:05:15.630 --> 00:05:18.120

download a few things from the Google



149

00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:19.650

service which is done I'm going to click



150

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.950

on accept click on next and it's now



151

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:24.150

going to start downloading and



152

00:05:24.150 --> 00:05:26.460

installing everything we've selected on



153

00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.280

that screen so you can basically go back



154

00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:31.560

to the SDK manager as often as you want



155

00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:34.140

to install new components or delete ones



156

00:05:34.140 --> 00:05:35.730

that have been replaced with newer



157

00:05:35.730 --> 00:05:37.740

versions and if you forget to install



158

00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.090

something it's not the end of the world



159

00:05:39.090 --> 00:05:40.530

because you can come back here and



160

00:05:40.530 --> 00:05:42.750

install it at your leisure now normally



161

00:05:42.750 --> 00:05:43.920

you will actually get a pop-up from



162

00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:45.930

Android studio itself where new versions



163

00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:47.490

are available and you can just install



164

00:05:47.490 --> 00:05:51.000

updates from there now if you're using



165

00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.890

windows check to see if there's a google



166

00:05:52.890 --> 00:05:54.930

USB driver component as I mentioned and



167

00:05:54.930 --> 00:05:56.790

install that as well as you find it but



168

00:05:56.790 --> 00:05:58.800

that's only on windows. Alright so



169

00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:01.380

let's say leave this now installing the



170

00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.300

various things and we'll come back once



171

00:06:03.300 --> 00:06:04.470

that's finished so we can go on and do a



172

00:06:04.470 --> 00:06:07.070

little bit more configuration.



173

00:06:07.070 --> 00:06:08.990

Alright so I can see at this point now



174

00:06:08.990 --> 00:06:10.670

it's actually finished the installation



175

00:06:10.670 --> 00:06:13.580

so you can select finish there we can



176

00:06:13.580 --> 00:06:15.230

click okay because we've done with this



177

00:06:15.230 --> 00:06:18.710

Android SDK manager and we go back to



178

00:06:18.710 --> 00:06:20.540

the welcome screen as you can see now



179

00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.980

before we finish this video there are a



180

00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:24.020

couple things to check what we want to



181

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.040

do is come down here and click on



182

00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.800

configure well a click on the select



183

00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:30.530

project defaults and then we want to



184

00:06:30.530 --> 00:06:35.540

click on project structure and you want



185

00:06:35.540 --> 00:06:38.120

to confirm your Android SDK location and



186

00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:41.570

the JDK location you know if you already



187

00:06:41.570 --> 00:06:43.220

had a different version of the JDK



188

00:06:43.220 --> 00:06:45.380

installed perhaps because you're also



189

00:06:45.380 --> 00:06:48.170

doing Java development or on an earlier



190

00:06:48.170 --> 00:06:49.820

version then make sure that this is



191

00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:52.910

actually set to use embedded JDK which



192

00:06:52.910 --> 00:06:54.260

is what Google recommends and you can



193

00:06:54.260 --> 00:06:56.150

see in my case that is checked so in



194

00:06:56.150 --> 00:06:58.130

other words it's using the JDK that



195

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:00.290

comes bundled with Android studio



196

00:07:00.290 --> 00:07:02.810

another separate version now with that



197

00:07:02.810 --> 00:07:05.270

said uses of 32-bit operating systems



198

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:08.270

primarily Windows or Linux users will



199

00:07:08.270 --> 00:07:10.280

need to change that, so only do the



200

00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.230

following if you're running a 32-bit



201

00:07:12.230 --> 00:07:15.050

version of Windows or Linux you've got a



202

00:07:15.050 --> 00:07:18.140

64-bit version of Windows or a Mac leave



203

00:07:18.140 --> 00:07:21.100

the JDK location set to use embedded JDK



204

00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:24.200

but on a 32-bit system you would uncheck



205

00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:27.710

this box here use embedded JDK and come



206

00:07:27.710 --> 00:07:29.210

over here and click on the ellipsis the



207

00:07:29.210 --> 00:07:31.760

three dots and you'd browse to your JDK



208

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:35.390

path. Now I don't have access to a 32-bit



209

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:38.300

Windows but you'll find the JDK path in



210

00:07:38.300 --> 00:07:41.930

program files or Program Files x86 on a



211

00:07:41.930 --> 00:07:44.060

Windows system so you should find a Java



212

00:07:44.060 --> 00:07:47.540

or a JDK or a JRE something along those lines



213

00:07:47.540 --> 00:07:50.570

so select that in that scenario now I'm



214

00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:53.180

a 32-bit Ubuntu Linux system the path



215

00:07:53.180 --> 00:07:55.280

will be something like slash USR slash



216

00:07:55.280 --> 00:08:00.100

Lib slash JVM says Java dash 8 - Oracle.



217

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:01.910

Alright so I want everything set



218

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:04.730

correctly you can click on ok, in my case



219

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:05.990

I'm going to click on cancel because I



220

00:08:05.990 --> 00:08:07.300

didn't need to make any changes



221

00:08:07.300 --> 00:08:09.620

obviously clicking ok would save any



222

00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:12.290

changes you made. Alright so in the next



223

00:08:12.290 --> 00:08:14.240

video we're going to look at hexam and



224

00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:15.919

the bios settings that you may need to



225

00:08:15.919 --> 00:08:17.780

change but there's one more thing that



226

00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.490

Windows users need to do though



227

00:08:19.490 --> 00:08:21.080

so for Windows users,



228

00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:23.479

click this start a new Android studio



229

00:08:23.479 --> 00:08:25.759

project and accept all the defaults



230

00:08:25.759 --> 00:08:27.680

until the project is created and opened



231

00:08:27.680 --> 00:08:30.139

so they basically keep clicking next in



232

00:08:30.139 --> 00:08:32.029

every screen watch out for the dialogue



233

00:08:32.029 --> 00:08:34.010

that I'm about to show you on the next



234

00:08:34.010 --> 00:08:37.039

slide so again this is for Windows users



235

00:08:37.039 --> 00:08:39.409

only when creating your first project



236

00:08:39.409 --> 00:08:41.390

you should get a dialog about Windows



237

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:43.459

Firewall blocking some features and you



238

00:08:43.459 --> 00:08:45.709

can see this the sample image on the



239

00:08:45.709 --> 00:08:48.410

screen so make sure you allow Java to



240

00:08:48.410 --> 00:08:51.200

communicate on private networks and tick



241

00:08:51.200 --> 00:08:53.570

public networks if it's ticked and it



242

00:08:53.570 --> 00:08:55.700

used to be the default and tick private



243

00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.589

networks before clicking allow access.



244

00:08:57.589 --> 00:09:00.200

Now the dialog does say that allowing



245

00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:01.880

access on public networks isn't



246

00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:04.519

recommended so allow access on private



247

00:09:04.519 --> 00:09:06.980

networks only. Now if you don't do this



248

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.930

you'll have problems adding libraries to



249

00:09:08.930 --> 00:09:10.370

your projects and updating Android



250

00:09:10.370 --> 00:09:12.860

studio, so it is very important so that



251

00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:14.750

you tick the box to allow access on



252

00:09:14.750 --> 00:09:17.269

private networks and because it's so



253

00:09:17.269 --> 00:09:18.350

important I'm going to mention it again



254

00:09:18.350 --> 00:09:19.820

and show the image on the screen again



255

00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.220

when you see this dialog make sure you



256

00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.260

tick the box marked private networks



257

00:09:24.260 --> 00:09:27.260

it's recommended that you also uncheck



258

00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:29.720

the public networks box but the



259

00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:31.310

important thing here is that you must



260

00:09:31.310 --> 00:09:34.579

allow access on private networks now



261

00:09:34.579 --> 00:09:36.770

this dialog may also pop up again after



262

00:09:36.770 --> 00:09:38.959

a Java update if it does that just



263

00:09:38.959 --> 00:09:40.550

remember that you must have private



264

00:09:40.550 --> 00:09:43.339

network access ticked. Alright so let's



265

00:09:43.339 --> 00:09:45.170

end the video here and we'll move on to



266

00:09:45.170 --> 00:09:47.589

the next one.
