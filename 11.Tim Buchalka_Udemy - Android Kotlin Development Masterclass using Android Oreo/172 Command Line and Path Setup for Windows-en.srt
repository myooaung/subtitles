1
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:09,660
in this video we're going to set up the
command line so that we can use to sql

2
00:00:09,660 --> 00:00:13,740
lite command-line interface now this is
actually for windows so if you're running

3
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,160
windows do watch this video as we go
through and show you how to set up the

4
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:21,330
path but if you're on a Mac or running
linux there's a separate video for you

5
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:25,100
in this section so go and watch that
one instead of this one because that's

6
00:00:25,100 --> 00:00:29,310
going to have everything that's needed
to get to the sql lite command line

7
00:00:29,310 --> 00:00:33,590
interface working on your operating
system but for windows you're in

8
00:00:33,590 --> 00:00:38,100
the right place so we actually are going
to digress and set up your

9
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,320
computer to access things as i mentioned
the like the sql lite Command

10
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,820
line interface and we're doing that so that
we can enter sql lite commands on

11
00:00:46,820 --> 00:00:47,850
your computer

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:50,960
alright and you may have noticed that
when you run your apps from android

13
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:57,300
studio sometimes a brief message pop up
saying waiting for ADB and this comes

14
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:02,210
up as Android studio starts the adb
server on your machine and check that

15
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:07,140
there's a physical device or emulator
that can connect to now ADB

16
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:12,210
extremely useful for managing android
devices and is the way that Android

17
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:16,890
studio installed and runs your app now
because android studio knows where the

18
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,860
sdk is installed on your machine this is
the Android SDK it can use tools like

19
00:01:21,860 --> 00:01:26,580
the sql lite command-line interface
and adb with no problems but for us to

20
00:01:26,580 --> 00:01:31,200
use them directly what we have to do is
add the Android SDKs platform tools

21
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,140
directory to our computers path

22
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:38,670
let's see how we go about doing that so
the first step is to see if the paths

23
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,780
already setup so make sure android
studio is started as you can see it's

24
00:01:42,780 --> 00:01:47,040
opened up here now and you can open the
project from the previous section

25
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:47,880
just fine

26
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,750
we're not actually going to use the
project we just need to get android

27
00:01:50,750 --> 00:01:51,840
studio running

28
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
alternatively you can just started as
I've got it here and just beyond the

29
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,430
main screen without opening a project
and once that starter want to actually

30
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:03,570
click on the terminal tab to start a
terminal session we can do that in a

31
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:09,210
few ways you can just come down here to
the windows button and we can if you've

32
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,470
got windows 10 you can just type in
command we get the command prompt come

33
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:16,560
up like that and i can press enter we
get a command prompt

34
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:18,000
alternatively on an older version

35
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,170
windows you just click on here will be a
run window and you type in CMD in there

36
00:02:22,170 --> 00:02:27,060
and press ENTER and you'll get a screen
similar to this one so now if we type in

37
00:02:27,060 --> 00:02:32,940
the command adb press enter and that's
checking to see whether the paths

38
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,900
already been set up as you can see in my
particular case i've got a message

39
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,400
saying adb is not recognized as an
internal or external command operable

40
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,500
program or batch file that's telling us
that we do need to continue on with the

41
00:02:46,500 --> 00:02:49,800
steps in the rest of this video if you
did get another message of something

42
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:53,130
about adb running that would mean that it's already been configured and

43
00:02:53,130 --> 00:02:54,390
you don't need to do it again

44
00:02:54,390 --> 00:02:59,370
alright so what we need to do now is
check where the Android SDK installed on

45
00:02:59,370 --> 00:03:04,230
your computer so go back to android
studio now if you've got a project open

46
00:03:04,230 --> 00:03:08,250
you can go to the file menu and select
project structure and that will get you

47
00:03:08,250 --> 00:03:11,940
to the same place i'm about to do here
and the welcome screen I can just click

48
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:18,060
on configure and go to SDK manager
and what we're looking for is this

49
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:23,450
android sdk location and you can see on
the screen there it's in my case c colon

50
00:03:23,450 --> 00:03:29,220
backslash users backslash tim backslash / app
data backslash local backslash android

51
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,720
backslash sdk quite a mouthful but
that's basically where the android sdk

52
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:38,540
is installed on this computer and it may
well be different for your computer and

53
00:03:38,540 --> 00:03:40,290
most likely it will be different

54
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:45,570
we're going to select the full path i'm
just going to copy it like so I'm doing

55
00:03:45,570 --> 00:03:50,250
command C and and going to just
open notepad and again in that you can

56
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:53,670
either in the run window you can type in
notepad or in the case of Windows 10 i

57
00:03:53,670 --> 00:03:57,200
can just type notepad or type
enough letters and it pops up the match

58
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,190
and open Notepad i'm going to paste in
that path so you can see the path that I

59
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:07,700
got from Android studio is now in the
notepad and again don't worry if yours

60
00:04:07,700 --> 00:04:10,920
is different if you copied it from
Android studio then it will be the

61
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:17,480
correct path to wherever your SDK is
installed now ADB and sql lite are

62
00:04:17,480 --> 00:04:21,900
actually stored in a folder called
platform tools within the Android SDK

63
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,580
folder so what we need to do is on the
end of this path that we've

64
00:04:26,580 --> 00:04:30,510
copied from Android studio we gonna put
another backslash and type platform-

65
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:38,610
tools like so and you can see
we've got the entire path showing on the

66
00:04:38,610 --> 00:04:42,750
screen there once we've done that we
need to copy this again i'm selecting

67
00:04:42,750 --> 00:04:46,650
and i'm doing a command c or
right click and select copy

68
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:52,500
either way and we need to then put
this path into the system android studio

69
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,100
won't actually detect the path change
until it restarts i'm going to exit

70
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:59,280
android studio anyway now that we're
done with that we don't need it anymore

71
00:04:59,790 --> 00:05:04,740
we're going to go into the windows
control panel or settings to make this

72
00:05:04,740 --> 00:05:10,020
change now if your computer's got a
Windows key then the quick way for all

73
00:05:10,020 --> 00:05:14,550
versions is to use the windows and pause
button and sometimes pause and breake

74
00:05:14,550 --> 00:05:17,490
are on the same key normally at the top right of
the keyboard

75
00:05:17,490 --> 00:05:20,970
however some laptops can be different
but that's the quickest way to get into

76
00:05:20,970 --> 00:05:26,910
the options the options where we want to
go and in my case what I'm going to do

77
00:05:26,910 --> 00:05:30,660
is I'm going to click on the windows
button click on settings and you might

78
00:05:30,660 --> 00:05:33,630
need to click on that and select control
panel depending on your version of

79
00:05:33,630 --> 00:05:38,430
windows alright now what I'm going to
do their will be a couple of ways for you to get to

80
00:05:38,430 --> 00:05:42,120
the area in control panel with the settings that
we need to get into on Windows 10 I

81
00:05:42,120 --> 00:05:46,350
can type advanced click on
View advanced system settings

82
00:05:47,670 --> 00:05:50,070
that's going to get me there but you may
actually have an option to go into

83
00:05:50,070 --> 00:05:55,080
system on an older version of windows to
get to the same screen and if you click

84
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:59,280
on the windows key and pause a windows
option pop up and a

85
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:03,060
little link you can click on to select
advanced system settings bottom line is

86
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,680
you want to get into this little screen
as we can see now and the other way

87
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,040
you can do it just in case you having
trouble finding it on windows we have

88
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:14,940
versions before Windows 10 just right
click the my computer icon on your

89
00:06:14,940 --> 00:06:17,370
desktop and choose properties and you
there

90
00:06:17,370 --> 00:06:21,510
Windows 10 doesn't have an easily
accessible my computer so press the

91
00:06:21,510 --> 00:06:24,960
start button and type environment would
be another way of doing it so you get

92
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,200
two options in that case but the first
one does nothing so click the second

93
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:28,740
one

94
00:06:28,740 --> 00:06:31,800
alright so we're going to be now
changing something here in the system

95
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,510
properties under advanced so from the
system properties want to click on the

96
00:06:36,510 --> 00:06:41,970
environment variables down here now unless your already really comfortable with

97
00:06:41,970 --> 00:06:44,770
doing this leave the system variables
alone

98
00:06:44,770 --> 00:06:49,330
if you mess up the system path variable
it can actually be quite difficult to

99
00:06:49,330 --> 00:06:54,030
recover from but under the user
variables at the top here there may or

100
00:06:54,030 --> 00:06:58,000
may not already be a path variable defined if their is you want to click on

101
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,110
it and click Edit but if their isn't just click new so assuming that

102
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:05,970
the said path over here to the
left click on edit but in my case I

103
00:07:05,970 --> 00:07:10,930
haven't got a path variable so i'm going
to click on new and because it's new i'm

104
00:07:10,930 --> 00:07:14,220
going to type path but if you were
editing at that point in time you

105
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:17,650
wouldn't touch the variable name because
that would already be set to path you've

106
00:07:17,650 --> 00:07:22,330
been working only in this variable value section
now if there was something already

107
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:25,300
in this path lets just say that you got
there and their is already something like that

108
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:28,500
showing leave that in there you don't
want to delete what's already in there

109
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,380
but you want to put a semicolon at the
end of it and then paste in what you've

110
00:07:32,380 --> 00:07:36,210
copied out of notepad so that they are
actually both their but in my case I'm

111
00:07:36,210 --> 00:07:40,240
going to delete that because of course
we didn't have a path user variable so

112
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,840
I'm just going to paste in  that
link that we've got from notepad and click

113
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:50,740
on ok so once that's done we can click
on OK and click on OK again and the

114
00:07:50,740 --> 00:07:55,780
changes will be made now what we're
going to do now is closed that down and

115
00:07:55,780 --> 00:07:59,800
we'll leave that notepad for now but we can
probably close that and not save

116
00:07:59,800 --> 00:08:00,660
it in a minute

117
00:08:00,660 --> 00:08:04,090
so now we're here what we're going to do
is we're going to type in a command like

118
00:08:04,090 --> 00:08:09,900
we type before adb to see whether it
works if you do get an error like that

119
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:15,960
what you need to do is click type exit
and close it down then we need to do the

120
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:19,240
same process to actually open the
command window again in my case i'm

121
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:26,460
going to type command and i'm going to
type adb again you can see now that

122
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:30,210
we've got a whole heap of mumbo-jumbo
there but the bottom line is that

123
00:08:30,210 --> 00:08:33,130
this time it didn't come up and say it
wasn't able to be found

124
00:08:33,130 --> 00:08:36,390
so what that's actually telling us is
that we now configured the path

125
00:08:36,390 --> 00:08:41,770
successfully and in the next video
when we start actually looking at how to

126
00:08:41,770 --> 00:08:45,450
use this sql lite will be able to
access that that's because the sql

127
00:08:45,450 --> 00:08:49,890
lite is in the same path as ADB if you
really wanted to at this point we could

128
00:08:49,890 --> 00:08:57,070
now type sql lite 3 and press enter and
you can see now that we've got an option

129
00:08:57,070 --> 00:08:58,570
coming and says sql lite version

130
00:08:58,570 --> 00:09:03,790
3.9.2 again
this is our way of accessing databases

131
00:09:03,790 --> 00:09:08,530
and we've confirmed we can use both the ADB
and sequel lights so we good to go so

132
00:09:08,530 --> 00:09:15,430
we can quit out of here and the way to
quit out of there is just to type .quit

133
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:21,430
that's it so that's the end of this
video we've tested that adb is working

134
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:25,510
but more importantly would also tested
that sql lite is working and now

135
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:28,780
that means that we're ready to go and
start working on this in the next video

136
00:09:28,780 --> 00:09:33,130
so because this is the windows video you
want to skip the mac and linux videos

137
00:09:33,130 --> 00:09:36,760
now that are following this one and move
on to the video after that we can start

138
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:39,550
using sql lite i'll see you in the
next video
