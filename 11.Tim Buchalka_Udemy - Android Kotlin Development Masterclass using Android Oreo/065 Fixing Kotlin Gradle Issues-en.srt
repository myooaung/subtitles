1
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:06,900
so just before we continue on with

2
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:09,150
working on our butt encounter app I want

3
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,730
to have a look at a potential warning

4
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:13,320
warning that we're actually getting when

5
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:14,850
we open the application when we open the

6
00:00:14,850 --> 00:00:17,220
project now we get this error over here

7
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:19,680
out at outdated Kotlin runtime and

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,590
that's because we updated the plugin but

9
00:00:22,590 --> 00:00:24,120
we haven't updated the Kotlin runtime

10
00:00:24,120 --> 00:00:25,290
and so there's a bit of a conflict

11
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,660
between the two and at the moment I want

12
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,820
to try and click on update runtime we

13
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:31,860
get an error here basically warning

14
00:00:31,860 --> 00:00:33,410
saying that we need to do it manually

15
00:00:33,410 --> 00:00:36,120
and when the future this who may well be

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:38,760
updated automatically for us but as of

17
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:40,589
the time of shooting these videos we

18
00:00:40,589 --> 00:00:42,780
need to do it manually so you can

19
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:44,519
continue on if you see that time warning

20
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:45,899
we don't have to change it but it's a

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,109
good idea to do it so to fix it what we

22
00:00:49,109 --> 00:00:51,390
want to do is we need to open our Gradle

23
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:53,429
file and come down here now there's two

24
00:00:53,429 --> 00:00:55,769
Gradle files in the project there's this

25
00:00:55,769 --> 00:00:58,499
build up Gradle and we will be changing

26
00:00:58,499 --> 00:00:59,699
that you'll see this in the course as

27
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:02,249
we're adding new versions of libraries

28
00:01:02,249 --> 00:01:04,559
and so forth that's not the one that we

29
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:06,150
need to change him we need to change the

30
00:01:06,150 --> 00:01:08,149
second one build da cradle down here

31
00:01:08,149 --> 00:01:10,740
double click on that and you can see

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:12,630
here it's currently got to the cutland

33
00:01:12,630 --> 00:01:15,540
version of one point one point 3-2 and

34
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:17,040
you can see heat see down here that this

35
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:19,020
is the one that it relates to so what

36
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:20,310
I'm going to do is come over here and

37
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,810
take a copy of this one point one point

38
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,310
four and I'm going to replace that so I

39
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:27,869
basically pasted over the top of the old

40
00:01:27,869 --> 00:01:29,610
version so I'm going to click on sync

41
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:32,340
now so what should happen is that the

42
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:35,039
new version should be downloaded and our

43
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:38,159
Android studio project updated and then

44
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,869
we should be able to continue on without

45
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:41,549
getting any warnings so if you see

46
00:01:41,549 --> 00:01:43,560
something like that do the same thing as

47
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:46,109
I've done there and update manually but

48
00:01:46,109 --> 00:01:47,250
at some point in time it'll probably

49
00:01:47,250 --> 00:01:50,159
become an automatic process all right so

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:51,390
you can see it down the bottom there are

51
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:57,149
working away so okay you can see now

52
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:00,210
that it seems to have finished we've got

53
00:02:00,210 --> 00:02:03,240
the build the Gradle build finished and

54
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:05,009
if I close down the project again it was

55
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:08,039
a good way of testing here and then open

56
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:12,230
it again and have a look at this now

57
00:02:12,230 --> 00:02:14,489
we're actually running one point one

58
00:02:14,489 --> 00:02:16,650
point four but now it's actually saying

59
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:18,190
that it the

60
00:02:18,190 --> 00:02:19,840
versus one point one point four -

61
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,980
release - Studio 3.0 - - don't think we

62
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:25,330
actually are running the same version

63
00:02:25,330 --> 00:02:27,040
but it's got to do with the fact that

64
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:29,560
Android studio is still beta as at the

65
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:30,850
time that I'm recording these videos

66
00:02:30,850 --> 00:02:34,090
because if we actually take a copy of

67
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:35,910
this I suspect it probably won't work

68
00:02:35,910 --> 00:02:38,440
it's not try and update this now to that

69
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:41,890
exact string I would say probably we'll

70
00:02:41,890 --> 00:02:46,810
get an error and you can see we've got

71
00:02:46,810 --> 00:02:48,820
an error there that it essentially can't

72
00:02:48,820 --> 00:02:50,290
find the file when that relates to the

73
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:51,580
version being wrong so I'm going to put

74
00:02:51,580 --> 00:02:53,170
a dot on the end there just in case that

75
00:02:53,170 --> 00:02:56,830
was significant try that again again I

76
00:02:56,830 --> 00:02:59,920
suspect we'll get an error here same

77
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,380
error so we go back now to the previous

78
00:03:02,380 --> 00:03:04,630
version that I added in this video one

79
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:10,090
point one point four and try again we

80
00:03:10,090 --> 00:03:12,250
can see that that's been accepted but

81
00:03:12,250 --> 00:03:13,990
we'll still get that warning each time

82
00:03:13,990 --> 00:03:16,180
we actually load up so I'll just close

83
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:19,959
the project down and open it up again

84
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:21,760
we're still getting a warning here but

85
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
you can see clearly now that we're

86
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,819
actually running one point one point for

87
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:27,280
the new version and the plug-in version

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:29,650
is one point one point four - release -

89
00:03:29,650 --> 00:03:32,110
to do three point zero - - so in this

90
00:03:32,110 --> 00:03:34,390
case I could we can click on ignore

91
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:35,950
because we know that we're running the

92
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,150
right version and then if a future

93
00:03:37,150 --> 00:03:39,400
version comes up we can then update that

94
00:03:39,400 --> 00:03:41,920
all right so I'm going to close down

95
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:44,920
these two files now the to build Gradle

96
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:46,900
files were opened and I'll end the video

97
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:48,879
here and keep this separate and in the

98
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:50,379
next video we'll actually move on then

99
00:03:50,379 --> 00:03:52,989
and continue working on our app and

100
00:03:52,989 --> 00:03:54,340
we're going to start by discussing the

101
00:03:54,340 --> 00:03:56,560
activity lifecycle so I will see you in

102
00:03:56,560 --> 00:03:59,040
the next video
