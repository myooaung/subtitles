1
00:00:05,280 --> 00:00:09,820
So I finished the last video by noting that our app does have one serious shortcoming.

2
00:00:09,850 --> 00:00:14,010
It can only display photos that are tagged with Android and Oreo.

3
00:00:14,260 --> 00:00:19,060
Now the last bit of functionality we need to provide is a search feature. Now we've already created

4
00:00:19,060 --> 00:00:20,420
the search activity,

5
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:25,180
so in the next couple of videos we're going to have a look at the Android search view, and see how we

6
00:00:25,180 --> 00:00:28,630
can use that to allow users to search for different photos.

7
00:00:28,820 --> 00:00:33,180
Now the first step though, is to change the main menu to include a search option.

8
00:00:33,430 --> 00:00:35,130
So we want to open our main menu.

9
00:00:35,140 --> 00:00:39,200
We do that by going into our res folder, and going into the menu folder,

10
00:00:39,340 --> 00:00:44,660
and we want to double click our menu underscore main dot xml to edit it in the layout designer.

11
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:49,330
Now at the moment, the menu only has a single item over here for settings as you can see, and you can see the

12
00:00:49,330 --> 00:00:51,140
option also in the component tree.

13
00:00:51,250 --> 00:00:52,950
So we're not actually going to be using settings,

14
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:54,130
so we're going to delete that.

15
00:00:54,280 --> 00:00:58,080
I can delete that on the component tree.

16
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:04,620
So what I want to do now is add another menu item by dragging it from the palette. So I'm going to add it to the component tree.

17
00:01:06,050 --> 00:01:13,190
I'll expand it so we can see it. OK I'm going to select it, and we need an ID so that we can tell which menu

18
00:01:13,190 --> 00:01:14,170
item was chosen.

19
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:20,500
So let's start by calling this one action underscore search.

20
00:01:20,510 --> 00:01:22,400
Now the title's going to be search.

21
00:01:22,510 --> 00:01:27,380
I'm going to create a string resource for this and we'll call it activity underscore search.

22
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:33,700
So I'm going to delete the existing text using the ellipsis, Add new resource, New String Value,

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:41,910
and again we're going to call this one action underscore search, and the Resource value, Search, and we're

24
00:01:41,910 --> 00:01:45,060
storing that in strings.xml again. Press enter there.

25
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:50,580
So basically that text will be displayed when the menu's expanded, but it's better to show an icon on

26
00:01:50,580 --> 00:01:55,590
the toolbar. Now to choose an icon, I'm going to click on the ellipsis next to the icon property,

27
00:01:55,610 --> 00:01:59,730
over here, and that brings up the resources dialogue.

28
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,870
Then you want to make sure that Drawable's selected over here to the left, which it is. So to find the default

29
00:02:04,900 --> 00:02:12,250
Android search icons, just come up here and type in here, search. Now when it finds them all,

30
00:02:12,250 --> 00:02:13,860
we use the first one in the list here,

31
00:02:13,960 --> 00:02:14,780
ic_menu_search.

32
00:02:14,780 --> 00:02:19,720
Click on that and it gives you a graphical representation of what that looks

33
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:20,160
like, the icon,

34
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,160
and click on OK.

35
00:02:22,750 --> 00:02:26,290
The next thing we need to do is set the showAsAction property,

36
00:02:26,290 --> 00:02:33,610
this is this one over here. Now, I'm going to come over here and get the list of options by clicking on the ellipsis.

37
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:36,440
Now always may sound like the one we want,

38
00:02:36,610 --> 00:02:41,020
but room is the preferred option, when you want to show the icon in the toolbar.

39
00:02:41,060 --> 00:02:46,360
So always will try to always show the item, even if that would result in it overlapping other menu

40
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:47,380
items.

41
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:51,170
Now there is actually a full description of these settings on this page.

42
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:55,240
Let's just go down and quickly we'll go to that page and quickly have a look at it.

43
00:02:55,330 --> 00:02:57,670
It's worth actually knowing this.

44
00:02:58,010 --> 00:02:59,320
I'll paste that in,

45
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:09,390
and scroll down to about the one third mark, and there's a good description for our showAsAction. There it

46
00:03:09,390 --> 00:03:10,620
is on the screen there.

47
00:03:11,190 --> 00:03:16,800
So we've only got one item on our menu, but it's worth becoming familiar with these options for when

48
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,190
you start creating more complex menus.

49
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:25,680
So based on these options here, I'm going to tick ifRoom because that seems to be the best option there,

50
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:28,840
"Only place this item in the app bar if there's room for it".

51
00:03:29,130 --> 00:03:32,340
Let's go back to Android Studio. I'm going to open that

52
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:34,540
again by clicking the ellipsis,

53
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:38,320
click on ifRoom, and I'm going to click on OK.

54
00:03:38,330 --> 00:03:43,600
Now I'm going to switch to text briefly, down here, by clicking on the text tab, because there's something

55
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,580
I want to mention in the xml.

56
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:51,120
Now most of the attributes for the menu item are in the Android namespace.

57
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:56,350
So they're a part of the Android framework and if you search the documentation, you find that they were available

58
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:05,320
from API one. We'll go back to the documentation. So notice that showAsAction was actually, is actually introduced,

59
00:04:05,320 --> 00:04:12,280
or showing as introduced in API 11. But scrolling up a bit, things like the title, the icon,

60
00:04:13,000 --> 00:04:17,530
they don't mentioned an API level, so in other words they were there from the beginning. The documentation doesn't

61
00:04:17,530 --> 00:04:23,650
always specify the level with the API levels 1. So again, the Android showAsAction was introduced as

62
00:04:23,740 --> 00:04:25,580
API level 11,

63
00:04:25,750 --> 00:04:31,540
and to make it available on older devices, the property's also been added to the support libraries.

64
00:04:31,540 --> 00:04:33,980
Now remember that we're using the support toolbar,

65
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:40,150
so the property that we want is in our app's namespace, not in the Android namespace. And going back to

66
00:04:40,540 --> 00:04:47,480
Android Studio again, that's why showAsAction is prefixed with app colon, rather than Android colon.

67
00:04:47,770 --> 00:04:51,920
Alright so that's how menu finished. Clicking it obviously won't do anything yet.

68
00:04:52,210 --> 00:04:56,230
What we want to do is launch the search activity, and we'll do that in the next video.
