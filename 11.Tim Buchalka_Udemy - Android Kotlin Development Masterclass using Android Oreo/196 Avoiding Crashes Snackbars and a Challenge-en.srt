1
00:00:05,170 --> 00:00:09,890
Or up so I would establish that the apps are pretty useless without permission to access the contacts.

2
00:00:10,070 --> 00:00:11,040
That's all it does.

3
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:13,580
So the core functionality is now disabled.

4
00:00:13,820 --> 00:00:18,950
We can stop the app from crashing into an app that does nothing is pretty bad but we don't want to get

5
00:00:18,950 --> 00:00:21,870
a reputation for writing apps that crash.

6
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:24,680
So what I'm going to do is just eyeball the floating action button.

7
00:00:24,830 --> 00:00:29,900
If we don't have permission to access the contex basically I'm going to write the kind of card that

8
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:35,890
you'd use if the permission was for for us some peripheral function that wasn't essential for your app

9
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:37,400
to be useful.

10
00:00:37,400 --> 00:00:42,710
Now one thing that might not have been obvious when you use a synthetic import is that the widget reference

11
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:46,200
is valid Sarratt the activities methods.

12
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:51,990
So that means we can refer to fap in the on request permission result method and disable it.

13
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:54,410
It's a permission isn't granted.

14
00:00:55,130 --> 00:01:01,280
So basically we can access it within the on request permissions result function here on the screen now.

15
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:07,250
Now not that I was careful to say the reference is valid throughout the activities methods.

16
00:01:07,250 --> 00:01:11,120
It's not necessarily available everywhere in the activity.

17
00:01:11,120 --> 00:01:16,940
And you say later that we can't always use these synthetic imports in an entire class which includes

18
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:23,860
listeners that we implement as an in a class when on request permissions results code we can enable

19
00:01:23,860 --> 00:01:27,930
you to side with a floating ection pattern depending on the result.

20
00:01:27,980 --> 00:01:34,760
That's what this is we can come down here at sort of the a test effort for us setting the rate.

21
00:01:34,760 --> 00:01:37,260
Granted they're able to True or false.

22
00:01:37,340 --> 00:01:48,210
Now in this next line we can put if I be dot is enabled equals right granted basically rather than just

23
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:53,970
typing the FAP in the else clause I've used a Boolean field read granted and put the code at the end

24
00:01:53,970 --> 00:02:00,270
of the case so that the Fab's enabled as well as disabled depending on whether we've got the required

25
00:02:00,270 --> 00:02:01,190
permission or not.

26
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:03,180
So that can be a useful technique.

27
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,280
Well we just wanted to side on some functionality let's just confirm that we to run the app again

28
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:20,380
coming over here and now I'm clicking on the fighting I should button the button and nothing's happening.

29
00:02:20,380 --> 00:02:25,200
So the turning action buttons now disciple as a result of us not having the required permission.

30
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:31,400
Now we might do something like that to disable a button or menu item in a more complex app but here

31
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:33,180
it's not very user friendly.

32
00:02:33,190 --> 00:02:37,260
We've got an app that doesn't do anything and there's nothing to let the user know why.

33
00:02:37,540 --> 00:02:39,810
So what I'm going to do instead is comment that line out

34
00:02:43,640 --> 00:02:50,170
and now it's time for a challenge What's your challenge is to modify the unclick list of the floating

35
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:56,500
action button so that it's own click method displays a snecked PA if permission to view the contacts

36
00:02:56,620 --> 00:03:03,490
isn't granted permission is granted the contact details should be displayed just that way when I read

37
00:03:03,490 --> 00:03:06,340
they up and accepted the permission request.

38
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:11,500
We haven't covered snack bars yet and I'm going to go into more detail about them shortly.

39
00:03:11,740 --> 00:03:17,380
But if you create a new project using the basic activity template you'll find the code you need in the

40
00:03:17,380 --> 00:03:19,950
on click method that's generated for you.

41
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,510
So you can copy that and paste that code into this project and note that you can create a new project

42
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:26,710
with that clarity in this one.

43
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,470
Once you've copied the code and closed a new project you'll be back in this one.

44
00:03:30,790 --> 00:03:31,620
So that's a challenge.

45
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:36,340
Pause the video now and see how you go with that challenge and I'll see you when you get back.

46
00:03:36,340 --> 00:03:40,020
Pause the video now.

47
00:03:40,020 --> 00:03:41,040
All right so welcome back.

48
00:03:41,160 --> 00:03:43,070
You managed to make it through that.

49
00:03:43,110 --> 00:03:45,140
Let's start by creating this new project.

50
00:03:45,160 --> 00:03:51,880
So I'm going to come over here and do file new project and I just need to accept all the defaults.

51
00:03:51,910 --> 00:03:59,160
Next Next I'm going to make sure I choose basic activities so we get the snack bar code in the fighting

52
00:03:59,160 --> 00:04:00,300
action button that we need.

53
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,460
Next.

54
00:04:01,740 --> 00:04:02,120
Finish

55
00:04:09,590 --> 00:04:13,190
OK once that's loaded I want to get the main activity OK.

56
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:20,650
Now we're going to grab this kind of snack bar card that's in the unclick the set list the junction

57
00:04:20,760 --> 00:04:22,390
and copy that.

58
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,340
And that's literally all we need from here.

59
00:04:24,340 --> 00:04:25,870
So I'm going to close the project.

60
00:04:26,020 --> 00:04:30,260
Now the full path is up here at the top in the total bar.

61
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:35,050
So you could make a night of that and delete the directory later if you want because we're not going

62
00:04:35,050 --> 00:04:36,970
to be we're using that app for anything else.

63
00:04:37,070 --> 00:04:38,310
We're going to close this one down.

64
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:40,410
File closed project.

65
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:45,110
And that brings us back into our other applique other project which was left open.

66
00:04:45,370 --> 00:04:52,250
So we need to do now is repped existing on click list a method in an IF statement when to come up here.

67
00:04:53,590 --> 00:04:56,430
Bother by occasionally offending anyone shooting you will get to these areas.

68
00:04:56,430 --> 00:05:02,790
When you open and close files for some reason you can build and rebuild that would nearly always fix

69
00:05:02,790 --> 00:05:03,510
the problem.

70
00:05:07,060 --> 00:05:09,630
Or you can say that the rebuild to fix that problem.

71
00:05:09,640 --> 00:05:16,770
All right so we need to replicate as I mentioned rapid if condition in now set on listener function.

72
00:05:16,780 --> 00:05:24,290
So what we're going to do is just after the fab unclick starts to look cool we're going to print parentheses

73
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:33,940
read granted and open up a code block and we're going to add an else and we're going to put a K for

74
00:05:33,940 --> 00:05:34,880
the else.

75
00:05:35,010 --> 00:05:39,700
Now what I'm going to do first is to the else is I'm going to paste in the code that I've just copied

76
00:05:40,330 --> 00:05:41,740
from the other project the snack bar.

77
00:05:41,770 --> 00:05:45,010
Copy paste that in.

78
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:49,880
Now I think that it's asking for an import object like look I tried that and began to change the text

79
00:05:49,880 --> 00:06:00,010
message day which would be please grant access to your contacts.

80
00:06:00,340 --> 00:06:04,700
What's the else code then we need to grab a copy of the code study from us.

81
00:06:04,710 --> 00:06:10,940
Well predicts projection lawn down to and including the contact Nimes dot adapter because up to Lawrence

82
00:06:10,940 --> 00:06:15,240
we're going to cut that clear up along that line there.

83
00:06:15,320 --> 00:06:20,720
I'm going to paste that in the first code block if the if condition was true.

84
00:06:21,190 --> 00:06:24,650
And just click on Heidi to accept those imports.

85
00:06:24,680 --> 00:06:29,960
So basically that's it we've got a test that's checking to see whether we've got permission and only

86
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:33,710
trying to execute the code in the fat pattern.

87
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:38,450
In other words to retrieve the contacts and display them if we have got read access and if we haven't

88
00:06:38,540 --> 00:06:43,820
got an else clause down here starting on line 61 that shows a message on the screen.

89
00:06:44,120 --> 00:06:49,760
So what we're going to do is go back to our emulator or just to make sure that we're starting with a

90
00:06:49,760 --> 00:06:52,520
clear a slight icon to an install.

91
00:06:52,550 --> 00:06:56,690
I want to close it down and I'm going to install it I would normally I install

92
00:07:00,660 --> 00:07:06,780
and install a content provider example which is of course I'm going to run the app again

93
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:11,950
I located on screen

94
00:07:15,070 --> 00:07:19,770
and Khattab I will tell you I don't have anything to say about getting the standard dialog to annoy

95
00:07:19,770 --> 00:07:21,080
or allow access.

96
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,460
And now when I click on denie you get permission refused to locate but if I click on the Fed but now

97
00:07:28,570 --> 00:07:32,890
you can see we get this little snack bar appearing on the bottom of the screen with a message for the

98
00:07:32,890 --> 00:07:33,440
user.

99
00:07:33,610 --> 00:07:35,010
So that's a lot friendlier.

100
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:40,330
Basically it's telling me who's in there that I need to grant access to their contacts in order to get

101
00:07:40,330 --> 00:07:42,240
out to display them.

102
00:07:42,730 --> 00:07:45,700
So your solution to the challenge might be slightly different to mine.

103
00:07:45,850 --> 00:07:47,940
But if it works I think congratulations.

104
00:07:48,190 --> 00:07:50,460
So that said we can do even better than that.

105
00:07:50,490 --> 00:07:55,870
So snecked possible the way we're introduced with material design as a replacement for text messages

106
00:07:56,230 --> 00:07:59,670
and there are a lot more interactive than the old test messages were.

107
00:07:59,950 --> 00:08:05,000
So I'm going to stop the video here and in the next one we'll have a look at snack bars in more detail

108
00:08:05,590 --> 00:08:09,240
and once we've done that we can improve our app even further.

109
00:08:09,430 --> 00:08:10,710
So I see you in the next video.
