00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:10.380

Alright, so now that we've got our activity to play a single video, we're going to extend the app to also allow a



2

00:00:10.390 --> 00:00:12.070

playlist to be played.



3

00:00:12.070 --> 00:00:16.630

Now this'll be a good opportunity to show how one activity can start another, something you really



4

00:00:16.630 --> 00:00:18.550

need to do a lot in Android apps.



5

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:23.590

So we're going to start by creating the layouts for main activity and standalone activity, and they're both



6

00:00:23.590 --> 00:00:26.640

very simple layouts, just containing two buttons each.



7

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:31.930

Now the activity_main layout was created for us by the wizard when we created this project.



8

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:37.340

So I'm going to edit that layout and delete the Hello World text view, and then drag two buttons onto the layout.



9

00:00:37.530 --> 00:00:43.540

So I'm going to open activity_main. I'm going to delete the Hello World widget, the text view that was



10

00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:49.180

added automatically, and then as I mentioned I'm going to drag two buttons onto the layout.



11

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:56.730

And what I might do is just close the project pane a little bit to make a bit more space for us here. That's probably large enough so



12

00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:57.630

let's go ahead and do that,



13

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:03.100

and I'll drag too. Now the buttons need to be constrained,



14

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:06.840

so I'm going to create constraints for the top button to the top and left edges of the layout,



15

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:17.760

like so, and what I probably should have done was set the default margins to 16 first so I'm going to do that



16

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:23.150

now, and what I'll then manually need to do is just change those to 16.



17

00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:26.600

That just gives us a bit more space.



18

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:31.220

And the second button needs to be constrained to the first one, so it's top edge is constrained to the bottom



19

00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:35.420

edge of the first button, and then we also want to constrain the left edge of that button to the left edge



20

00:01:35.420 --> 00:01:39.700

of the first button. Let's go ahead and do that, to



21

00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:42.310

the left edge of the button as well.



22

00:01:42.490 --> 00:01:47.440

Now margins of sixteen's obviously OK, we've set that, but remember that this second button, the left constraint



23

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:52.440

needs a margin of zero to line it up to the first button, because you can see it's indented there, so I'm going



24

00:01:52.440 --> 00:01:58.270

to change that to zero, because of course its constrained to the left edge of the first button.



25

00:01:58.290 --> 00:02:01.860

Now we need to give the buttons an ID, and also put some text on the buttons.



26

00:02:01.970 --> 00:02:06.870

So I'm going to click on the, or select the first one, and we'll call this one btn. The ID will be



27

00:02:06.990 --> 00:02:15.940

btnPlaySingle, PlaySingle, and if it comes up and prompts it we click on yes to rename all occurrences,



28

00:02:16.270 --> 00:02:22.000

and the text, let's put some text in there as well, Play a single.



29

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:25.530

And notice when I'm typing that we're getting autocomplete trying to be helpful.



30

00:02:25.660 --> 00:02:29.270

You need to be careful there to make sure that you're not actually getting something that we don't want on



31

00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:30.580

there so I'm going to keep typing,



32

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:37.680

Play a single video, and you may need to press escape here to close that menu down, to choose the text.



33

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:46.770

Alright so we've got the first one done. The second one, we'll call that one btn stand alone, btnStandAlone.



34

00:02:47.430 --> 00:02:50.970

OK, the text for that one is going to be Standalone



35

00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:59.390

Sub Menu, enter, and even though I've typed the button captions in normal case, they've appeared all in caps.



36

00:02:59.490 --> 00:03:04.660

So that's controlled by this Tt button down here in textStyle, and it's automatically selected for buttons.



37

00:03:04.670 --> 00:03:06.110

I think it looks better on so I'm going to leave it,



38

00:03:06.110 --> 00:03:09.770

but you can get normal case by clicking that button off if you decide. Alright



39

00:03:09.900 --> 00:03:12.310

so that's the activity_main layout now completed,



40

00:03:12.320 --> 00:03:19.950

so I'll go into the text tab again, and I'll format the code. I didn't need to, that was OK, back to design.



41

00:03:19.950 --> 00:03:21.960

Alright so let's move on to the next activity.



42

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:25.540

Now we could use a wizard to create this activity in its layout,



43

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:29.490

but I'm going to do them separately, just to show you what the wizard's doing for us.



44

00:03:29.910 --> 00:03:35.970

So to create the activities standalone layout, we just need to open the project pane, right click the layout,



45

00:03:36.660 --> 00:03:42.720

select new, layout resource file, making sure constraint layout is selected under the root element, and the



46

00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:50.270

name activity_standalone. Everything else is fine, so click on OK.



47

00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.250

Now this is going to be the same as the main activity layout with two buttons,



48

00:03:54.450 --> 00:03:59.520

one below the other. This time the buttons are called button play video and button play list, and they're constrained



49

00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:02.980

in the same way as we did in the earlier video. So let's just go ahead and quickly do that. We'll



50

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:07.860

close down the project pane again so we've got a bit more space.



51

00:04:08.100 --> 00:04:19.620

OK so Button, the first one, second one, I'll constrain the first button to the top and to the left, second button



52

00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:25.130

I'm going to constrain to the top, sorry the bottom of the first button, then to the left edge of the second button.



53

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:30.190

I need to change the margin on the second button to zero so that lines up correctly.



54

00:04:30.290 --> 00:04:32.290

Let's go ahead and actually change the ID.



55

00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:42.240

So the ID is going to be btnPlayVideo, press enter, select yes there if you get prompted, and the text,



56

00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:44.210

let's call this one Play Video.



57

00:04:47.550 --> 00:05:00.200

And for the second button, we'll use the ID btnPlaylist and the actual text will be Play Playlist.



58

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:07.050

Alright, I'll just go in and see whether we need to reformat, and you can see that's neatly formatted. In the previous versions



59

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:07.680

of this course,



60

00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:12.450

we found that we needed to reformat the code quite a bit. But Android Studio has got a lot better these



61

00:05:12.450 --> 00:05:16.590

days with how it's creating the XML, so we don't need to do that as often. It's only fairly rare that



62

00:05:16.590 --> 00:05:18.570

we need to make those changes. Alright,



63

00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:23.430

so at this point we're now done. The two layouts are created, and in the next video we'll start adding the



64

00:05:23.430 --> 00:05:26.630

code to make it all work. So I'll see you in the next video.
