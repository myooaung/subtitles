1
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:07,350
in this section we're going to create an

2
00:00:07,350 --> 00:00:09,090
app that stores data in a sequel light

3
00:00:09,090 --> 00:00:11,190
database know the apps going to be a

4
00:00:11,190 --> 00:00:13,770
task timer that we can use to record how

5
00:00:13,770 --> 00:00:16,800
long to spend on different tasks it's

6
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,510
useful if you have to complete

7
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:20,580
timesheets for billing customers for

8
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:22,859
your work for example and it introduces

9
00:00:22,859 --> 00:00:24,630
some very important techniques for

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:26,550
Android programming including all the

11
00:00:26,550 --> 00:00:28,470
operations you'll need to perform on a

12
00:00:28,470 --> 00:00:31,140
database the databases will have

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:33,270
separate tables to store the tasks that

14
00:00:33,270 --> 00:00:35,130
we'll be timing and the timings

15
00:00:35,130 --> 00:00:37,380
themselves so that you'll be seeing how

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:39,840
to add data to a database when tables

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,970
are joined now more importantly perhaps

18
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:44,790
you'll also see how to delete associated

19
00:00:44,790 --> 00:00:47,580
records in a joined table in this case

20
00:00:47,580 --> 00:00:49,740
if you delete a task then all the

21
00:00:49,740 --> 00:00:52,200
timings associated with that task will

22
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:54,480
also need to be deleted of course it's

23
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,400
good practice to warn users that this

24
00:00:56,400 --> 00:00:58,350
will happen and the app will also use

25
00:00:58,350 --> 00:01:01,050
dialogues to warn the user and allow

26
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,510
them to cancel the operation although

27
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:05,280
the focus of Android apps tends to be

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:07,200
phones it's well worth considering

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,350
tablet users when producing your apps in

30
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,810
this app editing a task record on a

31
00:01:12,810 --> 00:01:14,970
phone will show a different screen

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:17,100
because there just isn't enough room on

33
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,550
a phone's display but on a tablet users

34
00:01:20,550 --> 00:01:22,490
will be able to win up the task details

35
00:01:22,490 --> 00:01:25,500
alongside the list of tasks

36
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,110
now we achieve that by using fragments

37
00:01:28,110 --> 00:01:29,850
and we'll also be seeing how to

38
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:31,140
implement those fragments

39
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:33,600
you know apps now another thing that

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,210
this app will need to do is record and

41
00:01:36,210 --> 00:01:38,520
display dates and we'll be using the

42
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:41,610
Java calendar classes to do that now it

43
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:43,770
may seem like an easy thing to do but

44
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:45,570
you have to be really very careful when

45
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:48,180
dealing with time users can download

46
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:49,770
your app from almost anywhere in the

47
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:52,650
world and it's very easy to mess up when

48
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,960
dealing with different time zones so I'm

49
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:56,280
going to be looking at how to safely

50
00:01:56,280 --> 00:01:58,650
deal with time across the world in your

51
00:01:58,650 --> 00:02:01,049
apps we'll also see another way to

52
00:02:01,049 --> 00:02:03,000
respond to events from a recycle of you

53
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:05,520
knew our list of tasks will include

54
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,069
buttons to edit or delete the tasks and

55
00:02:08,069 --> 00:02:10,140
will need to respond to taps on the task

56
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:13,620
itself to start and stop timing so let's

57
00:02:13,620 --> 00:02:15,389
have a look at the app running on an

58
00:02:15,389 --> 00:02:17,250
emulator so

59
00:02:17,250 --> 00:02:19,590
first thing we do is provide the user

60
00:02:19,590 --> 00:02:22,560
with basic information on how to use the

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,480
app when they first run them so this

62
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:26,730
screen will show a list of tasks that

63
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:29,340
the users set up but until they create

64
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:31,680
some tasks the display would be empty

65
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:33,720
and we've taken advantage of all that

66
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:35,340
space to give them some basic

67
00:02:35,340 --> 00:02:38,220
instructions so tapping on the plus icon

68
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,880
up here in the toolbar allows new

69
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,020
details to be entered

70
00:02:43,020 --> 00:02:45,180
now we've seen edit text hints before

71
00:02:45,180 --> 00:02:48,300
and they were very useful way of letting

72
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:50,580
the user know when they should answer on

73
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,230
what they should enter into each field

74
00:02:52,230 --> 00:02:54,150
and they cancel that and go back home

75
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:57,989
and then select abandoned changes you'll

76
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:01,620
rotate the phone into landscape now I'm

77
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:03,660
going to tap on the plus sign in the

78
00:03:03,660 --> 00:03:06,300
toolbar again now the apps using

79
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:08,220
fragments here and you can take

80
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,709
advantage of the extra screen width to

81
00:03:10,709 --> 00:03:12,540
perform the editing on the right-hand

82
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:13,470
side of the screen

83
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,550
all right so I'm going to into some

84
00:03:14,550 --> 00:03:17,790
details here now I'm going to top task

85
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:22,070
timer for the name click on next

86
00:03:22,070 --> 00:03:27,600
I'm gonna top Android database app for

87
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:29,190
the description and notice when I

88
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,870
started typing that the android keyboard

89
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:33,750
took over and in landscape each field is

90
00:03:33,750 --> 00:03:36,780
presented for editing and androids also

91
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,760
adding this next button to move on to

92
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:40,560
the next field so I'm going to add to

93
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:42,959
zero here for sort order and that's so

94
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,400
this app should appear at the start of

95
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:46,110
this list and then I'm going to click on

96
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:49,350
done now when I click on save over here

97
00:03:49,350 --> 00:03:52,079
the data is saved to the database and

98
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,350
we've now got one task in our list so

99
00:03:55,350 --> 00:03:57,090
let's add another task now in landscape

100
00:03:57,090 --> 00:03:58,320
mode and then we'll swing over to

101
00:03:58,320 --> 00:04:01,140
portrait for the one after that so this

102
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:02,970
is my Java course entry so I'm going to

103
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:06,290
type in Java course and click on next

104
00:04:06,290 --> 00:04:08,220
description I'm going to leave blank and

105
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:10,110
that's because the task name says enough

106
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:13,769
so next and for sort order I'm going to

107
00:04:13,769 --> 00:04:17,010
enter 10 number 10 click on done and

108
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:20,130
they click on save now the Java course

109
00:04:20,130 --> 00:04:22,650
task is sorting below the task timer

110
00:04:22,650 --> 00:04:24,960
task and that's because Taft's time i

111
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,479
have a sort order of zero right so I

112
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:30,070
switch back to portrait of

113
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:32,600
we're going to tap on the plus icon in

114
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:35,690
the toolbar to enter one more task now

115
00:04:35,690 --> 00:04:37,430
because the screen isn't wide enough to

116
00:04:37,430 --> 00:04:40,010
show the list and allowed data entry the

117
00:04:40,010 --> 00:04:41,900
fragments displayed by itself here in

118
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,540
portrait mode using fragments lets us

119
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:47,060
write apps that automatically adapt to

120
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:49,220
extra screen space to give the user a

121
00:04:49,220 --> 00:04:51,560
better experience rights or the name for

122
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,150
this is our task it's going to be

123
00:04:53,150 --> 00:04:56,630
cycling now it's good to take a break

124
00:04:56,630 --> 00:04:57,950
from the computer now and then so I'm

125
00:04:57,950 --> 00:04:59,480
going to record how much time I spend in

126
00:04:59,480 --> 00:05:01,790
cycling but that is a slightly vague

127
00:05:01,790 --> 00:05:03,350
name so I'm going to make the

128
00:05:03,350 --> 00:05:09,020
description ride my bicycle in day in

129
00:05:09,020 --> 00:05:10,490
portrait mode there's enough space to

130
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:12,950
display the end of text and the keyboard

131
00:05:12,950 --> 00:05:15,260
as you can see so Android doesn't have

132
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:17,900
to present their fields one by one now

133
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:20,300
the data is not saved which means it'll

134
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:21,830
be lost if we use the home or back

135
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:23,320
buttons to return to the previous screen

136
00:05:23,320 --> 00:05:27,410
so I click on that back so what I'll do

137
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:29,960
is come up here and just fix that typo

138
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:34,160
there so what we come back so to prevent

139
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,530
the loss of data we're showing a dialog

140
00:05:36,530 --> 00:05:38,330
here so that the user knows they're

141
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:40,970
about to lose data if they continue in

142
00:05:40,970 --> 00:05:42,740
my case I want to save those changes so

143
00:05:42,740 --> 00:05:44,650
we're going to choose continue editing

144
00:05:44,650 --> 00:05:46,880
so I'm going to leave the sort or a

145
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:49,310
blank and it should default to zero that

146
00:05:49,310 --> 00:05:51,590
means that this task will sort to the

147
00:05:51,590 --> 00:05:53,840
top of the list and if two tasks have

148
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:55,730
the same sort order then they'll appear

149
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:58,180
alphabetically so when I click on save

150
00:05:58,180 --> 00:06:01,850
we can see that cycling is at the top in

151
00:06:01,850 --> 00:06:03,860
order to start timeing a task we just

152
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:06,010
long tap it so I'm going to do that now

153
00:06:06,010 --> 00:06:08,450
the heading change is to show which task

154
00:06:08,450 --> 00:06:11,180
is currently being timed now if we were

155
00:06:11,180 --> 00:06:13,070
billing a customer for this task or any

156
00:06:13,070 --> 00:06:15,110
of the tasks we probably wouldn't be

157
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:16,670
interested in charging for every second

158
00:06:16,670 --> 00:06:19,490
so I'll stop timing that now and if you

159
00:06:19,490 --> 00:06:23,900
go into settings and we've got options

160
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:26,690
here to ignore timings for tasks that

161
00:06:26,690 --> 00:06:28,460
last less than a certain amount of time

162
00:06:28,460 --> 00:06:30,770
now you've probably seen sliders like

163
00:06:30,770 --> 00:06:33,020
this before but what's not obvious is

164
00:06:33,020 --> 00:06:35,540
just how much control you can provide by

165
00:06:35,540 --> 00:06:38,120
using them in most applications dragging

166
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,340
the slider would increase some value in

167
00:06:40,340 --> 00:06:42,530
a linear fashion but that wouldn't

168
00:06:42,530 --> 00:06:43,999
really make a lot of sense

169
00:06:43,999 --> 00:06:46,009
if you wanted to ignore timings less

170
00:06:46,009 --> 00:06:49,159
than five minutes that's 300 seconds and

171
00:06:49,159 --> 00:06:51,050
you'd have to drag the slider a long way

172
00:06:51,050 --> 00:06:53,270
to get that high but the slide is a

173
00:06:53,270 --> 00:06:54,469
little bit different though I'm just

174
00:06:54,469 --> 00:06:55,759
going to tap to it now

175
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:57,919
nobody is my keyboard just to show you

176
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:00,919
the increments so as we start off you

177
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:02,300
can see the increments of five seconds

178
00:07:02,300 --> 00:07:05,300
and that is true until we get to 55

179
00:07:05,300 --> 00:07:08,389
seconds after that though if I do

180
00:07:08,389 --> 00:07:10,039
another one notice how to now jump to

181
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:12,560
one minute then it counts in 5-minute

182
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:14,810
increments until it gets to 15 minutes

183
00:07:14,810 --> 00:07:17,300
then the next time it goes to 30 minutes

184
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:19,939
then to 45 minutes and then it jumps to

185
00:07:19,939 --> 00:07:21,830
one hour then the next minute convinced

186
00:07:21,830 --> 00:07:24,289
to two hours so you can see that we can

187
00:07:24,289 --> 00:07:26,449
provide a lot of flexibility without

188
00:07:26,449 --> 00:07:27,979
having to clutter the screen up with all

189
00:07:27,979 --> 00:07:30,020
sorts of different sliders and we'll be

190
00:07:30,020 --> 00:07:31,909
seeing how to create a slider like this

191
00:07:31,909 --> 00:07:34,610
in this app as well so move that slider

192
00:07:34,610 --> 00:07:36,919
back to zero now otherwise we have to

193
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:38,779
wait a long time to get any real timing

194
00:07:38,779 --> 00:07:40,639
data to display in the reports that

195
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:42,979
we're about to look at now this settings

196
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:45,529
menu also lets us choose which day a

197
00:07:45,529 --> 00:07:48,500
week starts on some companies start on a

198
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:49,639
Sunday when they're doing accounting

199
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:52,520
other start on a Monday so tapping up

200
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,129
the tapping the day here brings up by

201
00:07:55,129 --> 00:07:57,620
this list of days which is a dialog

202
00:07:57,620 --> 00:07:59,360
where you can choose the day of the week

203
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:01,219
and it's probably a bit pointless

204
00:08:01,219 --> 00:08:03,199
including the other weekdays in this app

205
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:05,120
but this is a good example of how to

206
00:08:05,120 --> 00:08:07,879
choose one of a range of options and for

207
00:08:07,879 --> 00:08:09,259
that reason all the weekdays are

208
00:08:09,259 --> 00:08:11,689
included so I'm going to make my weekday

209
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:15,500
start on a Monday alright so we click on

210
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:18,699
back now to go back to our list of tasks

211
00:08:18,699 --> 00:08:20,779
alright so let's start another timing

212
00:08:20,779 --> 00:08:22,969
for my Java course you can see that's

213
00:08:22,969 --> 00:08:24,830
showing on the screen there now I could

214
00:08:24,830 --> 00:08:27,439
just long tap that again just top it but

215
00:08:27,439 --> 00:08:28,610
if I want to actually switch over to

216
00:08:28,610 --> 00:08:30,800
another task I could long tap that task

217
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,990
and it ends the timing for the Java

218
00:08:32,990 --> 00:08:35,360
course and starts the timing for the but

219
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:37,519
the year cycling all right so that's

220
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:39,949
enough sorry I'm going to long tap that

221
00:08:39,949 --> 00:08:42,620
to stop it it's time to get back to work

222
00:08:42,620 --> 00:08:44,839
so the second icon in the toolbar up

223
00:08:44,839 --> 00:08:47,750
here that's used to display reports of

224
00:08:47,750 --> 00:08:49,480
how long we spent on each task

225
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:51,980
so this durations reports I'll open it

226
00:08:51,980 --> 00:08:54,589
now there's got two different layouts

227
00:08:54,589 --> 00:08:56,790
for portrait and landscape

228
00:08:56,790 --> 00:08:59,040
portrait mode we can see the task name

229
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:00,600
the date and how long was spent on each

230
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:02,880
task in other words the duration but

231
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:04,380
whenever I take the device back into

232
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:07,020
landscaping in there now we also get the

233
00:09:07,020 --> 00:09:09,840
description showing as well now you can

234
00:09:09,840 --> 00:09:12,030
sort the list by clicking on the column

235
00:09:12,030 --> 00:09:14,400
headings we can see the timers in task

236
00:09:14,400 --> 00:09:16,530
order or by clicking on the description

237
00:09:16,530 --> 00:09:18,990
column here description heading rather

238
00:09:18,990 --> 00:09:20,790
you can see that it's now sorted by

239
00:09:20,790 --> 00:09:23,370
description we can also display four

240
00:09:23,370 --> 00:09:25,860
weeks or just single days but with only

241
00:09:25,860 --> 00:09:27,750
two timing records that's not easy to

242
00:09:27,750 --> 00:09:30,090
demonstrate this is a good time though

243
00:09:30,090 --> 00:09:32,460
to show a bug in the program though now

244
00:09:32,460 --> 00:09:34,380
at the moment we're viewing a full

245
00:09:34,380 --> 00:09:36,900
week's data there's only data for today

246
00:09:36,900 --> 00:09:38,790
and because I've only just done some

247
00:09:38,790 --> 00:09:40,830
timing the button on the toolbar up here

248
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:44,010
shows a one to indicate that it'll

249
00:09:44,010 --> 00:09:46,140
switch to just showing a single day so

250
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:49,740
when I tap that it changes to a seven as

251
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:51,630
you can see in the screen there now to

252
00:09:51,630 --> 00:09:52,860
indicate that tapping it again would

253
00:09:52,860 --> 00:09:54,900
display a full week but what's actually

254
00:09:54,900 --> 00:09:57,390
happened to the data it was there in the

255
00:09:57,390 --> 00:09:59,730
week view and should be appearing for

256
00:09:59,730 --> 00:10:02,040
today well it's very easy to get things

257
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:03,870
messed up when you're dealing with dates

258
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:06,390
and times across the world I can see the

259
00:10:06,390 --> 00:10:08,220
timings that were there by using the

260
00:10:08,220 --> 00:10:09,960
calendar icon or clicking on that and

261
00:10:09,960 --> 00:10:12,120
choosing the previous day using

262
00:10:12,120 --> 00:10:14,970
yesterday in my case it's the 12th click

263
00:10:14,970 --> 00:10:17,640
on OK and the entries actually appear

264
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:19,920
again and there's the timing data back

265
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:22,350
now I selected yesterday in the calendar

266
00:10:22,350 --> 00:10:25,050
but the date column over here is still

267
00:10:25,050 --> 00:10:27,720
showing today's date so the reason for

268
00:10:27,720 --> 00:10:29,280
that is that I'm recording this in

269
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,590
Australia which is currently nine and a

270
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,510
half hours ahead of Greenwich Mean Time

271
00:10:33,510 --> 00:10:36,600
GMT because I'm recording this early in

272
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:38,430
the morning it's still yesterday

273
00:10:38,430 --> 00:10:40,890
effectively at Greenwich unless you

274
00:10:40,890 --> 00:10:43,590
specify otherwise times are in GMT

275
00:10:43,590 --> 00:10:46,170
Greenwich Mean Time that's going to have

276
00:10:46,170 --> 00:10:48,660
serious implications for most parts of

277
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:52,020
the world including places like the UK

278
00:10:52,020 --> 00:10:55,230
and Portugal that use GMT in summer both

279
00:10:55,230 --> 00:10:56,910
those places change their clock to

280
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,580
summer time so we've got an app here

281
00:10:59,580 --> 00:11:01,740
that works sometimes in some parts of

282
00:11:01,740 --> 00:11:03,660
the world but won't work all the time

283
00:11:03,660 --> 00:11:06,210
anywhere well that's not quite true

284
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:08,790
it'll work all the time in Casablanca in

285
00:11:08,790 --> 00:11:10,620
the Azores where they stay on Jim

286
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:13,290
all year round but overall that's not

287
00:11:13,290 --> 00:11:15,360
good and you'll get a chance to fix this

288
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:17,640
towards the end of the section and yes I

289
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,830
did say you but don't worry though we'll

290
00:11:19,830 --> 00:11:21,030
be covering the problem and solution

291
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,760
before the challenge alright so I'm

292
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:25,140
going to go back to the main tasks

293
00:11:25,140 --> 00:11:28,800
screen now and the menu up here has also

294
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,590
got a generate option that we can use to

295
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:33,780
generate test data so I'm going to click

296
00:11:33,780 --> 00:11:37,260
on that and it'll make our report a bit

297
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:38,430
more interesting and you can see that

298
00:11:38,430 --> 00:11:40,200
it's completed already depending on the

299
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:41,520
speed of your computer it may take a

300
00:11:41,520 --> 00:11:43,920
while this menu option won't appear

301
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:45,870
though in the release version of the app

302
00:11:45,870 --> 00:11:48,120
there's some code that checks to see if

303
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:50,160
we're running in debug mode which you

304
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,360
are when you're running directly from

305
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:53,820
Android studio as I am that makes this

306
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:56,550
option visible the code though hasn't

307
00:11:56,550 --> 00:11:58,890
got any frills it's really only there to

308
00:11:58,890 --> 00:12:00,390
generate data for use while we're

309
00:12:00,390 --> 00:12:02,190
testing so that we don't have to wait

310
00:12:02,190 --> 00:12:04,980
while we create hundreds of timings and

311
00:12:04,980 --> 00:12:06,270
if we were going to do something like

312
00:12:06,270 --> 00:12:08,160
this for users then you should run it as

313
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:10,590
a background thread because in my case

314
00:12:10,590 --> 00:12:12,660
even though it was relatively fast the

315
00:12:12,660 --> 00:12:14,970
emulator appeared to hang you may find

316
00:12:14,970 --> 00:12:16,230
that the displays called blank for

317
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:19,080
example on earlier versions of Android

318
00:12:19,080 --> 00:12:20,880
the point is that the app was very

319
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:22,770
definitely blocking the user interface

320
00:12:22,770 --> 00:12:25,080
which is not a good thing so this

321
00:12:25,080 --> 00:12:27,870
generate data option generates between

322
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:30,720
100 and 500 random timing records for

323
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,520
each of the tasks that exists in the

324
00:12:32,520 --> 00:12:34,680
database so it will take a little while

325
00:12:34,680 --> 00:12:36,660
but it's much quicker than us having to

326
00:12:36,660 --> 00:12:39,180
create the data ourselves and actually

327
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:40,410
it's a bit slower than it should be

328
00:12:40,410 --> 00:12:42,540
because the method that generates the

329
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:44,910
random data also logs what's doing in

330
00:12:44,910 --> 00:12:45,630
the logcat

331
00:12:45,630 --> 00:12:47,640
so although the emulator screen looked

332
00:12:47,640 --> 00:12:49,320
like there was nothing happening if I

333
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:52,980
quickly bring up in Android studio you

334
00:12:52,980 --> 00:12:54,120
can see that there's quite a few min

335
00:12:54,120 --> 00:12:56,600
trees there showing details about the

336
00:12:56,600 --> 00:12:59,370
actual wah timings that were actually

337
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:01,290
generated all right so I'm gonna close

338
00:13:01,290 --> 00:13:03,950
it down here back to our emulator

339
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,610
alright so now that that's finished

340
00:13:05,610 --> 00:13:07,200
we're going to go back to our reports

341
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:11,760
again by clicking on the icon now the

342
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:14,730
report is sorted by name then date but

343
00:13:14,730 --> 00:13:16,530
we can group all the cycling tasks

344
00:13:16,530 --> 00:13:18,660
together by clicking on the task name

345
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:22,650
heading look so now the first button on

346
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:24,780
the toolbar that's a switch between

347
00:13:24,780 --> 00:13:26,490
displaying a whole week or just the

348
00:13:26,490 --> 00:13:28,500
current day now at the moment it's

349
00:13:28,500 --> 00:13:30,210
showing a whole week's worth of data by

350
00:13:30,210 --> 00:13:31,530
clicking on the one button

351
00:13:31,530 --> 00:13:33,140
that's what's there just showing tonight

352
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:35,390
and if you're doing this in America

353
00:13:35,390 --> 00:13:37,740
within five to eight hours at midnight

354
00:13:37,740 --> 00:13:39,870
you'll be seeing tomorrow's timings and

355
00:13:39,870 --> 00:13:43,740
that's because the USA is behind GMT and

356
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,050
as we saw earlier that the Year button

357
00:13:46,050 --> 00:13:47,730
icon also changes to reflect the fact

358
00:13:47,730 --> 00:13:51,000
that clicking it again will show a week

359
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:52,230
and again they've got that same

360
00:13:52,230 --> 00:13:54,120
situation there with the bug they talked

361
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:56,970
about if the GMT bug so I have to go

362
00:13:56,970 --> 00:13:59,010
back and click on the previous day to

363
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:00,600
actually get more data to display on the

364
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:03,690
screen all right now we have seen that

365
00:14:03,690 --> 00:14:05,550
calendar so I click that calendar again

366
00:14:05,550 --> 00:14:07,320
there now this time we're going to go

367
00:14:07,320 --> 00:14:09,810
back about a month now so I'm gonna go

368
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:13,860
back to my chooses a May the 16th click

369
00:14:13,860 --> 00:14:17,730
on OK there and if I cross here now and

370
00:14:17,730 --> 00:14:21,840
click on the icon the 7 button now the

371
00:14:21,840 --> 00:14:23,670
app should work out which seven days

372
00:14:23,670 --> 00:14:25,320
will be displayed based on the data I

373
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:28,110
just chose and which day we've set for

374
00:14:28,110 --> 00:14:29,340
the first day of the week in the

375
00:14:29,340 --> 00:14:31,530
settings and that's easy to see there

376
00:14:31,530 --> 00:14:33,480
now if I click the date heading first

377
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:35,220
season sort that you can see you've got

378
00:14:35,220 --> 00:14:37,560
entries from the 14th 16th 17th and 19th

379
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:40,140
of May and just to confirm if we go back

380
00:14:40,140 --> 00:14:42,450
to click on the calendar that is correct

381
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:44,310
because I chose Monday as my start of

382
00:14:44,310 --> 00:14:47,040
the week and that's the 14th and we can

383
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,020
see Sunday was a 13th fair and we've got

384
00:14:49,020 --> 00:14:51,900
no entries showing for the 13th I cancel

385
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:52,230
out of that

386
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,510
so basically same data here from the

387
00:14:54,510 --> 00:14:56,790
14th through to the 19th which is

388
00:14:56,790 --> 00:14:59,100
correct and that's obviously assuming

389
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:00,900
there's data for each day of course and

390
00:15:00,900 --> 00:15:02,730
if we didn't have that bug that I've

391
00:15:02,730 --> 00:15:04,860
talked about now the version of the app

392
00:15:04,860 --> 00:15:07,050
is currently displaying dates in the

393
00:15:07,050 --> 00:15:10,650
American format month day year that can

394
00:15:10,650 --> 00:15:11,880
be confusing for people in other

395
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:13,920
countries so we'll also be seeing how we

396
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:16,020
can display the dates in the users

397
00:15:16,020 --> 00:15:18,140
preferred format based on their country

398
00:15:18,140 --> 00:15:20,550
all right so finally now there's an

399
00:15:20,550 --> 00:15:23,190
option to delete old data so we get to

400
00:15:23,190 --> 00:15:25,440
choose a date and everything before that

401
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:28,080
date will be deleted so I'm going to

402
00:15:28,080 --> 00:15:29,790
choose the 16th year so I'm going to

403
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,040
click on the menu option select it

404
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:34,020
delete old timings I'm going to choose

405
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:37,970
the 16th click on OK

406
00:15:37,970 --> 00:15:40,100
asks us for confirmation so we got a

407
00:15:40,100 --> 00:15:41,509
prompt here making sure that we really

408
00:15:41,509 --> 00:15:43,670
do want to delete all that data and if I

409
00:15:43,670 --> 00:15:46,910
cancel it the data will still show but

410
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:49,040
if I go back to the option select delete

411
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:53,060
old timings select the 16th of May click

412
00:15:53,060 --> 00:15:56,600
on OK click on OK again and you can see

413
00:15:56,600 --> 00:15:59,870
now that the data prior to the date that

414
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:02,360
I've selected has now been deleted well

415
00:16:02,360 --> 00:16:04,009
that's the theory at least it was

416
00:16:04,009 --> 00:16:06,050
actually a bug in the program but fixing

417
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:07,790
that is also going to be challenged

418
00:16:07,790 --> 00:16:09,680
towards the end of the section all right

419
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:11,120
so we'll go back to Nell to our main

420
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,240
list again so there's two buttons we can

421
00:16:14,240 --> 00:16:16,310
use to editor task details and delete

422
00:16:16,310 --> 00:16:18,889
the tasks so when I click the button the

423
00:16:18,889 --> 00:16:20,329
delete button over here the trash icon

424
00:16:20,329 --> 00:16:23,209
next to the Java course there's a

425
00:16:23,209 --> 00:16:24,879
dialogue option that pops up here

426
00:16:24,879 --> 00:16:27,050
warning that the timers will also be

427
00:16:27,050 --> 00:16:29,779
deleted so our timings data is stored in

428
00:16:29,779 --> 00:16:32,329
a separate table that links to the tasks

429
00:16:32,329 --> 00:16:34,250
table and there's no point keeping all

430
00:16:34,250 --> 00:16:36,589
the timings around if you no longer know

431
00:16:36,589 --> 00:16:38,839
which task it relates to so the database

432
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:41,300
has been set up with a trigger when a

433
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,089
task has deleted all the timings records

434
00:16:44,089 --> 00:16:46,790
with the same task ID are automatically

435
00:16:46,790 --> 00:16:48,949
deleted for us and we'll be seeing how

436
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:50,689
to do that as we write the up as well so

437
00:16:50,689 --> 00:16:52,689
I'm going to click on delete here now

438
00:16:52,689 --> 00:16:55,459
which deletes that and now if we go back

439
00:16:55,459 --> 00:16:58,220
to our reports we should see any other

440
00:16:58,220 --> 00:17:00,949
entries relating to the Java tasks

441
00:17:00,949 --> 00:17:07,490
because it's been deleted back a

442
00:17:07,490 --> 00:17:08,569
previous week and again there's nothing

443
00:17:08,569 --> 00:17:10,579
related to what Java are actually

444
00:17:10,579 --> 00:17:12,829
showing them in the list anymore alright

445
00:17:12,829 --> 00:17:14,890
so go back to the main task list again

446
00:17:14,890 --> 00:17:17,030
now the up source I've got an about

447
00:17:17,030 --> 00:17:18,829
dialog in the menu in the main screen so

448
00:17:18,829 --> 00:17:21,709
I'll click on the button there so an

449
00:17:21,709 --> 00:17:23,329
about screen is a good place to provide

450
00:17:23,329 --> 00:17:25,250
additional information about the app and

451
00:17:25,250 --> 00:17:27,169
we'll see how to include clickable links

452
00:17:27,169 --> 00:17:29,929
in our screens so here I can click on

453
00:17:29,929 --> 00:17:32,030
the link here to launch the Android

454
00:17:32,030 --> 00:17:38,240
browser I can choose one I need to go

455
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:39,409
through the initial defaults and then it

456
00:17:39,409 --> 00:17:40,340
will then load that web page

457
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:43,580
automatically and when I close the

458
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:47,179
browser notice that we get back to our

459
00:17:47,179 --> 00:17:49,610
application again and we'll be seeing

460
00:17:49,610 --> 00:17:51,920
how to do that as well now I can't demos

461
00:17:51,920 --> 00:17:53,780
the email link we just go back again and

462
00:17:53,780 --> 00:17:56,840
have a look there's also an email link

463
00:17:56,840 --> 00:17:58,310
there I can't demonstrate that because I

464
00:17:58,310 --> 00:17:59,840
don't have the email setup on this our

465
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,820
Android emulator but on a physical

466
00:18:01,820 --> 00:18:03,830
device tapping the email address will

467
00:18:03,830 --> 00:18:05,810
launch your email program with the to

468
00:18:05,810 --> 00:18:07,760
address already filled in ready for you

469
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:09,950
to type an email so our previous

470
00:18:09,950 --> 00:18:12,140
dialogues had ok and cancel buttons but

471
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:13,880
this one's just got an OK button so I

472
00:18:13,880 --> 00:18:16,700
can click on that to close that down so

473
00:18:16,700 --> 00:18:18,650
that's our app it's basic functionality

474
00:18:18,650 --> 00:18:20,990
may be quite simple but we're going to

475
00:18:20,990 --> 00:18:22,760
be learning a lot of useful techniques

476
00:18:22,760 --> 00:18:25,010
when we write this app and we'll start

477
00:18:25,010 --> 00:18:26,600
by looking at the underlying database

478
00:18:26,600 --> 00:18:30,520
which we'll do in the next video
