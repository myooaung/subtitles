00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:07.230

In the previous videos, we created our



2

00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:09.210

first hello world Android application



3

00:00:09.210 --> 00:00:11.340

and then I showed you how to set up and



4

00:00:11.340 --> 00:00:13.530

configure a virtual device or emulator.



5

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:15.480

So now it's time to run the application



6

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:18.720

on the AVD. Now you'll find out



7

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.570

about virtual devices emulators and avds



8

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:24.029

throughout the course and use the terms



9

00:00:24.029 --> 00:00:25.140

interchangeably,



10

00:00:25.140 --> 00:00:27.930

strictly speaking emulator refers to the



11

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:29.580

software that the virtual device is



12

00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:31.500

running inside but we're not really



13

00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:34.079

interested in that level of detail, using



14

00:00:34.079 --> 00:00:36.120

an emulator to run a virtual device is a



15

00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.739

way to get the Android operating system



16

00:00:37.739 --> 00:00:40.469

running on your computer so that you can



17

00:00:40.469 --> 00:00:42.450

run programs on it as though it were a



18

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:45.000

real device and it's very handy if you



19

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:46.920

haven't got a physical device and also



20

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:48.989

lets you test on different Android



21

00:00:48.989 --> 00:00:51.570

versions just by creating a new AVD so



22

00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:53.070

we're going to run the hello world



23

00:00:53.070 --> 00:00:55.850

application on an Android virtual device.



24

00:00:55.850 --> 00:00:57.870

Now you should have Android studio



25

00:00:57.870 --> 00:00:59.969

running as I've got and the hollow world



26

00:00:59.969 --> 00:01:02.760

application opened Android studio keeps



27

00:01:02.760 --> 00:01:04.350

a track of the last few projects that



28

00:01:04.350 --> 00:01:05.939

you've worked on so you can just click



29

00:01:05.939 --> 00:01:07.500

on hello world on the left hand side of



30

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:08.970

the welcome screen to load the project



31

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:11.340

if it's not already opened. Now we saw



32

00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:13.049

one way to start an emulator in the



33

00:01:13.049 --> 00:01:15.330

previous video from the tools menu



34

00:01:15.330 --> 00:01:18.990

I chose Android and then AVD manager and



35

00:01:18.990 --> 00:01:21.450

now from the AVD manager click the green



36

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:23.430

triangle next to the virtual device that



37

00:01:23.430 --> 00:01:25.290

you want to start, I'm going to click on



38

00:01:25.290 --> 00:01:27.119

that now and you've got a slow computer



39

00:01:27.119 --> 00:01:28.920

it's probably a good idea to start the



40

00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:30.869

virtual device before you actually need



41

00:01:30.869 --> 00:01:32.430

it you can leave it loading together



42

00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:34.229

with your work and you can also close



43

00:01:34.229 --> 00:01:35.939

down the Android virtual device manager



44

00:01:35.939 --> 00:01:39.750

before the emulator has fully loaded you



45

00:01:39.750 --> 00:01:42.409

don't need to wait for it to fully load.



46

00:01:42.409 --> 00:01:45.560

Now when the emulator has fully started



47

00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.729

you're ready to use it to run your app



48

00:01:47.729 --> 00:01:49.649

and you can see that it's started now so



49

00:01:49.649 --> 00:01:50.960

I'm gonna switch back to Android studio



50

00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:53.220

now to run our app there's several ways



51

00:01:53.220 --> 00:01:55.380

the obvious way to run is to go to the



52

00:01:55.380 --> 00:01:58.140

run menu and select run up there before



53

00:01:58.140 --> 00:01:59.670

I click that phone notice the green



54

00:01:59.670 --> 00:02:01.770

arrow up here there's also another green



55

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.990

arrow up on the toolbar as well, so we



56

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:05.939

could choose that as well and get that



57

00:02:05.939 --> 00:02:08.250

to run that way instead so I'm going to



58

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.039

click on this one neither one would work



59

00:02:10.039 --> 00:02:13.110

so the next thing it needs to know is



60

00:02:13.110 --> 00:02:13.850

what do we want to



61

00:02:13.850 --> 00:02:15.740

run this on. Now because I've already



62

00:02:15.740 --> 00:02:18.080

started an emulator it appears at the



63

00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.450

top here on the connected devices any



64

00:02:20.450 --> 00:02:21.890

emulators that are running as well as



65

00:02:21.890 --> 00:02:23.450

any physical devices that are plugged



66

00:02:23.450 --> 00:02:25.700

into the computer should appear here and



67

00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:27.470

you can just choose the one you want to



68

00:02:27.470 --> 00:02:30.110

use. Now this also integrates quite



69

00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.880

nicely with the AVD manager so that



70

00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:33.350

system images that you've set up from



71

00:02:33.350 --> 00:02:35.390

there will appear in the available and



72

00:02:35.390 --> 00:02:37.010

emulators section which will show up if



73

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:38.930

there are extra ones and you can create



74

00:02:38.930 --> 00:02:41.240

a new emulator here if you like using



75

00:02:41.240 --> 00:02:42.260

the button at the bottom and it just



76

00:02:42.260 --> 00:02:44.300

launches the AVD manager so it's



77

00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.590

probably not often that you want to use



78

00:02:45.590 --> 00:02:47.750

this button more useful is that you can



79

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:48.980

choose an emulator that isn't running



80

00:02:48.980 --> 00:02:50.600

and start up from here and I'm going to



81

00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:51.410

be doing that next,



82

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:53.600

for now though we've already got an



83

00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.060

emulator started so I'm just going to



84

00:02:56.060 --> 00:02:57.590

select the one or lengthen so I



85

00:02:57.590 --> 00:02:59.510

currently selected at the top and click



86

00:02:59.510 --> 00:03:01.700

on ok then I'm going to tab over to my



87

00:03:01.700 --> 00:03:03.170

emulator and you see down the bottom



88

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.430

we've got some things happening that



89

00:03:04.430 --> 00:03:07.340

Gradle build running eventually we



90

00:03:07.340 --> 00:03:09.520

should see the app start in the emulator



91

00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.540

there were previous versions of Android



92

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.510

studio before version 2.2 you used to



93

00:03:14.510 --> 00:03:16.970

open up the run pane automatically then



94

00:03:16.970 --> 00:03:18.740

switch to the Android monitor pane once



95

00:03:18.740 --> 00:03:21.050

the app started running, but the first



96

00:03:21.050 --> 00:03:22.730

event draw studio I'm using to record



97

00:03:22.730 --> 00:03:25.640

this video doesn't do that but they may



98

00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:27.050

have put that feature back in again in



99

00:03:27.050 --> 00:03:29.930

the future the Android monitor pane has



100

00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:32.600

also been renamed to log cat, I suppose



101

00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.650

that's not surprising



102

00:03:33.650 --> 00:03:35.180

because everyone referred to a less the



103

00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:38.210

logcat anyway. Now you can see that the



104

00:03:38.210 --> 00:03:40.400

app is now started and it is worth



105

00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.690

having a look at these panes when you



106

00:03:41.690 --> 00:03:43.250

run an app, so I'm gonna open up the run



107

00:03:43.250 --> 00:03:45.620

pane over here and click on that and you



108

00:03:45.620 --> 00:03:47.540

can see the commands that it used to



109

00:03:47.540 --> 00:03:49.940

deploy the app to the phone and start it



110

00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:52.160

running and if you've played around with



111

00:03:52.160 --> 00:03:53.930

AVB to reach your device and install



112

00:03:53.930 --> 00:03:55.820

apps on it and this may all look very



113

00:03:55.820 --> 00:03:57.830

familiar but if it doesn't make much



114

00:03:57.830 --> 00:03:59.690

sense then don't worry about it it's not



115

00:03:59.690 --> 00:04:01.010

something you need to know how to do



116

00:04:01.010 --> 00:04:02.960

because Android studio runs the ADB



117

00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:05.630

commands for you. ADB by the way



118

00:04:05.630 --> 00:04:08.090

stands for Android debug bridge and



119

00:04:08.090 --> 00:04:10.190

that's the method used to communicate



120

00:04:10.190 --> 00:04:11.780

with an Android device when developing,



121

00:04:11.780 --> 00:04:13.190

we're going to be looking at these



122

00:04:13.190 --> 00:04:15.530

commands in a later section and we'll



123

00:04:15.530 --> 00:04:17.510

set up ADB and have a look at some of



124

00:04:17.510 --> 00:04:19.340

the things that you can do with it, the



125

00:04:19.340 --> 00:04:20.750

only reason you'd be interested in this



126

00:04:20.750 --> 00:04:22.280

pane at the moment though is if



127

00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.800

something goes wrong, you can then either



128

00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.270

google the error message or ask a



129

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:27.290

question in the Q&A



130

00:04:27.290 --> 00:04:28.640

section of this course and paste the



131

00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.440

contents of that screen into your



132

00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:33.230

question though the logcat screen is a



133

00:04:33.230 --> 00:04:34.460

little bit more interesting, so I'm going



134

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:36.500

to click on that but it's also scary



135

00:04:36.500 --> 00:04:38.750

because a lot seems to be happening I'm



136

00:04:38.750 --> 00:04:40.190

not going to talk about it right at this



137

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:41.600

moment because we've missed most of the



138

00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.400

excitement so I'm going to come back to



139

00:04:43.400 --> 00:04:45.770

the logcat shortly, so firstly we go back



140

00:04:45.770 --> 00:04:49.070

to our emulator tab over we can see the



141

00:04:49.070 --> 00:04:51.050

hello world program app running on this



142

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:52.700

emulator. Now it looks just like a



143

00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:54.380

physical Android device with the home



144

00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:56.720

button etc at the bottom in our app



145

00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.880

running in the window our simple app



146

00:04:58.880 --> 00:05:00.440

doesn't do a great deal but that's just



147

00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.060

how you can test your app using an



148

00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.310

emulator, so I can close the app using



149

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:06.290

the back button and just like on a



150

00:05:06.290 --> 00:05:07.880

physical device when you install apps



151

00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.980

from the Play Store there's an icon to



152

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.870

launch hello world from the devices apps



153

00:05:11.870 --> 00:05:14.240

menu, so if I click on that you can see



154

00:05:14.240 --> 00:05:15.560

we've got our holo world up there I can



155

00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:17.990

click on that to start it you may have



156

00:05:17.990 --> 00:05:19.760

noticed some activity down here in this



157

00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:21.500

lock kept poem or all that was going on



158

00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:23.060

so let's actually have a look at that



159

00:05:23.060 --> 00:05:25.340

and so that we can see that all from the



160

00:05:25.340 --> 00:05:26.390

start I will just shut down this



161

00:05:26.390 --> 00:05:28.280

emulator and we'll start it back up



162

00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.920

again using the other method I mentioned.



163

00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.480

You can stop the emulator by either



164

00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:33.800

holding down this power button here



165

00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:35.960

holding down the button and powering off



166

00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:37.910

but you also close it by clicking on



167

00:05:37.910 --> 00:05:39.680

this little X button down here, either



168

00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:40.820

way well actually close down the



169

00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:43.760

emulator. Alright so now instead of



170

00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:45.350

starting an emulator first I'm just



171

00:05:45.350 --> 00:05:47.870

going to run the program. Now if you've



172

00:05:47.870 --> 00:05:49.520

got a fast computer with loads of RAM



173

00:05:49.520 --> 00:05:51.530

there's no need to start an emulator



174

00:05:51.530 --> 00:05:53.900

first in the button bar at the top of



175

00:05:53.900 --> 00:05:55.010

the screen there's a green arrow that



176

00:05:55.010 --> 00:05:56.660

you can use to run your app like I



177

00:05:56.660 --> 00:05:59.900

clicked earlier you'll do that again and



178

00:05:59.900 --> 00:06:01.340

when I've clicked that it asks for an



179

00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:03.800

emulator or device to run on and that's



180

00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:06.050

the same screen we saw earlier but now



181

00:06:06.050 --> 00:06:07.700

there's no running devices connected



182

00:06:07.700 --> 00:06:09.680

devices is a nun we've got available



183

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:12.440

virtual devices showing the nexus 5x API



184

00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:21.860

26, eventually when that's loaded the



185

00:06:21.860 --> 00:06:23.630

application will automatically start and



186

00:06:23.630 --> 00:06:26.390

I've got the logcat showing on the



187

00:06:26.390 --> 00:06:28.250

screen here as you can see so we should



188

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:29.780

be able to see things happening here if



189

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:32.360

that does as that does start, now I



190

00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.850

say should be able to, the log cat



191

00:06:34.850 --> 00:06:36.770

often hangs on the emulator that you've



192

00:06:36.770 --> 00:06:39.050

just closed so it might be showing us



193

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:40.969

disconnected or just generally not



194

00:06:40.969 --> 00:06:42.769

dating it doesn't seem to be doing much



195

00:06:42.769 --> 00:06:44.059

of the way of updating here in the or so



196

00:06:44.059 --> 00:06:45.979

you can see and this is the disconnected



197

00:06:45.979 --> 00:06:47.269

here that I'm referring to in this in



198

00:06:47.269 --> 00:06:49.039

the drop down window I'm gonna change



199

00:06:49.039 --> 00:06:51.889

that to select a new emulator click on



200

00:06:51.889 --> 00:06:53.869

that select a new emulator and then



201

00:06:53.869 --> 00:06:55.879

we'll be good to go and as we get new



202

00:06:55.879 --> 00:06:57.229

messages and as we do things on the



203

00:06:57.229 --> 00:06:59.149

computer that will then be updated and



204

00:06:59.149 --> 00:07:01.969

showing the logcat, you can see that as



205

00:07:01.969 --> 00:07:03.319

I'm doing things were getting entries in



206

00:07:03.319 --> 00:07:05.809

there start color world again there's



207

00:07:05.809 --> 00:07:07.519

generally a lot going on in the logcat



208

00:07:07.519 --> 00:07:09.409

and what we might do is just to see that



209

00:07:09.409 --> 00:07:10.909

in full glory we'll close this down



210

00:07:10.909 --> 00:07:13.279

power it off and then we'll start it



211

00:07:13.279 --> 00:07:15.529

again and you'll be able to see the



212

00:07:15.529 --> 00:07:16.969

emulator and all the various messages



213

00:07:16.969 --> 00:07:18.649

that's at the moment you can see it says



214

00:07:18.649 --> 00:07:20.319

disconnected so I'm gonna start that again



215

00:07:20.319 --> 00:07:22.249

I'm gonna come down here straight away



216

00:07:22.249 --> 00:07:25.879

give it a second to start and select no



217

00:07:25.879 --> 00:07:27.799

filters over here and you feel good



218

00:07:27.799 --> 00:07:29.779

absolutely everything quite a bit of



219

00:07:29.779 --> 00:07:31.099

information as you can see there and



220

00:07:31.099 --> 00:07:32.419

this is what I was talking about before



221

00:07:32.419 --> 00:07:35.029

you can see some some of the messages



222

00:07:35.029 --> 00:07:36.589

have got a i in a slash at the beginning



223

00:07:36.589 --> 00:07:38.899

information messages you can see others



224

00:07:38.899 --> 00:07:43.459

I've got a w/ for warning and e/ for error



225

00:07:43.459 --> 00:07:46.579

there's also color coded as well. Now the



226

00:07:46.579 --> 00:07:48.709

logcat clears itself as our app launches



227

00:07:48.709 --> 00:07:50.779

each time so if I go back and actually



228

00:07:50.779 --> 00:07:53.209

select our app show only selected



229

00:07:53.209 --> 00:07:55.099

application there's currently nothing so



230

00:07:55.099 --> 00:07:56.539

they'll be little to nothing showing and



231

00:07:56.539 --> 00:07:58.189

that's because this app is a bit too



232

00:07:58.189 --> 00:08:00.739

simple to long much of interest and in



233

00:08:00.739 --> 00:08:02.209

fact as you can see in my case it's have



234

00:08:02.209 --> 00:08:04.459

to absolutely blink at the moment now



235

00:08:04.459 --> 00:08:06.349

we're gonna be looking at a log cat in



236

00:08:06.349 --> 00:08:08.209

more detail a bit later,



237

00:08:08.209 --> 00:08:09.829

we've actually got some more log entries



238

00:08:09.829 --> 00:08:11.929

to see but now though I just want you to



239

00:08:11.929 --> 00:08:13.849

be aware that it's there if you get



240

00:08:13.849 --> 00:08:16.069

properly to wrap if they crash you'll



241

00:08:16.069 --> 00:08:18.169

find a crash report in the log cat and



242

00:08:18.169 --> 00:08:20.029

you can copy that in the same way as



243

00:08:20.029 --> 00:08:21.829

your copy text in the Edit window and



244

00:08:21.829 --> 00:08:23.569

paste them into the QA section of this



245

00:08:23.569 --> 00:08:26.239

course along with your question now it



246

00:08:26.239 --> 00:08:27.829

may not mean much to you at first but



247

00:08:27.829 --> 00:08:30.049

it'll be very useful to us when working



248

00:08:30.049 --> 00:08:32.569

out why your app crashes so the emulator



249

00:08:32.569 --> 00:08:33.979

overall does a pretty good job of



250

00:08:33.979 --> 00:08:35.479

showing what your application will look



251

00:08:35.479 --> 00:08:37.339

like and you'll be seeing that in



252

00:08:37.339 --> 00:08:39.050

operations a lot more as we go through



253

00:08:39.050 --> 00:08:40.759

the course, that's because it's one of



254

00:08:40.759 --> 00:08:42.289

the core things that I recommend you do



255

00:08:42.289 --> 00:08:44.569

to be testing your applications as much



256

00:08:44.569 --> 00:08:46.519

as possible and seeing what they look



257

00:08:46.519 --> 00:08:48.649

like on the screen now certainly



258

00:08:48.649 --> 00:08:50.179

recommend that you test a final version



259

00:08:50.179 --> 00:08:52.309

of an application on a physical device



260

00:08:52.309 --> 00:08:54.770

before you upload it to the place to



261

00:08:54.770 --> 00:08:56.960

but for testing purposes the emulators



262

00:08:56.960 --> 00:08:59.660

are great, they also allow you to test on



263

00:08:59.660 --> 00:09:01.250

the different versions of Android that



264

00:09:01.250 --> 00:09:03.050

your app supports without you having to



265

00:09:03.050 --> 00:09:04.700

go out and buying loads of Android



266

00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.190

phones and tablets so it's a great way



267

00:09:07.190 --> 00:09:08.810

to get a feel for what your application



268

00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:10.910

is going to look like before it goes



269

00:09:10.910 --> 00:09:13.100

into production and before you test it



270

00:09:13.100 --> 00:09:15.110

on a physical device so that's testing



271

00:09:15.110 --> 00:09:17.180

on an emulator if you can run them



272

00:09:17.180 --> 00:09:19.430

they're a great help if you do have



273

00:09:19.430 --> 00:09:20.930

problems running emulators because your



274

00:09:20.930 --> 00:09:22.730

machine doesn't have enough memory then



275

00:09:22.730 --> 00:09:23.960

you can run all the apps in this course



276

00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.060

on a real Android device though so don't



277

00:09:26.060 --> 00:09:28.460

be too put off if you can't run an



278

00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:30.740

emulator Android devices are also fairly



279

00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:32.570

cheap these days, so it can be a very



280

00:09:32.570 --> 00:09:34.730

inexpensive way to test on a really



281

00:09:34.730 --> 00:09:36.170

Android device if you've got problems



282

00:09:36.170 --> 00:09:37.730

using emulators. Alright so I'm going



283

00:09:37.730 --> 00:09:39.770

to end the video now in the next video



284

00:09:39.770 --> 00:09:41.330

we're going to fire up one of my Android



285

00:09:41.330 --> 00:09:44.360

devices when X is 5x and run the app on



286

00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.160

the physical machine just to show you



287

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:47.450

what it looks like on that and how to



288

00:09:47.450 --> 00:09:49.580

use it on a real device, so I'll see you



289

00:09:49.580 --> 00:09:52.510

in the next video.
