1
00:00:03,940 --> 00:00:08,410
so in this video we're going to set up
the android sdk for the terminal so that

2
00:00:08,410 --> 00:00:12,090
we can access the via command-line
interface this is actually for linux

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:17,280
users the last two videos prior to this
one were for windows and mac users so if

4
00:00:17,280 --> 00:00:20,500
you're running one of those operating
systems don't bother watching this video

5
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,890
but instead go back and watch the
appropriate video for your operating

6
00:00:23,890 --> 00:00:27,430
system that's because the instructions
to get this to work are different for

7
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:30,370
each operating system but if you're
running linux you're in the right place

8
00:00:30,370 --> 00:00:34,090
and do watch this video as i go
through now and show you how to set up

9
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:38,350
the path now we're going to be talking
about setting up the computer to access

10
00:00:38,350 --> 00:00:42,690
things like the sql lite command-line
interface so that we can enter the

11
00:00:42,690 --> 00:00:47,850
sql lite commands on the computer or on
your computer and this will also allow

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:52,440
us to use the Android debug bridge or ADB and we'll be using that later in the

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,400
course and just out of interest you may
have noticed that when you run your apps

14
00:00:56,400 --> 00:01:00,870
from android studio you sometimes see a
brief message saying waiting for ADB

15
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:05,580
well that comes up as Android studio
starts the ADB server on your machine

16
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:09,880
and checks that there's a physical
device or emulator that it can connect

17
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,860
to now the ADB the Android debug
bridge is extremely useful for managing

18
00:01:14,860 --> 00:01:18,910
android devices and is the way
that Android studio installs and runs

19
00:01:18,910 --> 00:01:24,580
your apps now because android studio
knows where the android sdk is installed

20
00:01:24,580 --> 00:01:27,730
on your machine because it actually
install it when you were first installed

21
00:01:27,730 --> 00:01:31,720
android studio you can use tools like
the sql lite command-line interface

22
00:01:31,720 --> 00:01:35,980
and aDb with no problems but for us to
use them directly

23
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:40,630
we have to actually add the Android SDKs
platform tools directory to our

24
00:01:40,630 --> 00:01:45,850
computer paths manually so letes actually
see how to do that so the first step we

25
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:49,960
want to do is check to see if the paths
already set up so i've got android

26
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:53,980
studio opened and you can either be open
on the welcome screen or you can open a

27
00:01:53,980 --> 00:01:58,000
project that perhaps you've worked on in
the previous section in which case you

28
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,020
want to click on the file menu and
select project structure and make sure

29
00:02:02,020 --> 00:02:06,520
you click on sdk location if your on the
welcome screen just click on configure

30
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,510
and going to sdk manager both of those
methods should take you to the same

31
00:02:10,510 --> 00:02:15,640
screen and what were looking for is this
android sdk location so that's the

32
00:02:15,640 --> 00:02:17,410
location on my computer

33
00:02:17,410 --> 00:02:21,670
where the android software development
kit was installed by Android studio so

34
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:24,970
I'm actually going to select that path
i'm going to copy it because we're going

35
00:02:24,970 --> 00:02:28,510
to need a little bit later so I'm just
going to do a ctrl C to copy that

36
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,140
because so going to paste and make
a change at that shortly

37
00:02:32,140 --> 00:02:36,760
next is just going to come down and
come up here rather and select terminal

38
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:44,770
i'm actually gonna type in the commands
sql lite 3 and you can

39
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:48,490
see it says sql lite three is
currently not installed you can install

40
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,730
it by typing and that gives us the
command to install up but we don't want

41
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:56,770
to do that because sql lite 3 is
actually in the android studio folder so

42
00:02:56,770 --> 00:02:59,680
instead what we're going to do is we're
going to change the path to point to

43
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,060
that folder if you got a message there
and come up and said sql lite 3

44
00:03:04,060 --> 00:03:07,660
and perhaps a version number and was
asking for some input what that means

45
00:03:07,660 --> 00:03:09,550
is it's already set up on your system

46
00:03:09,550 --> 00:03:13,240
you don't need to do the steps that I'm
about to go through assuming that that's

47
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,840
not the case and that you have got the
same error that I got on the screen

48
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:20,650
or one that similar saying that it's not
installed then what we can do is

49
00:03:20,650 --> 00:03:26,290
continue on and add that path now the
user path on Ubuntu linux is set by

50
00:03:26,290 --> 00:03:30,280
adding a command to the file .profile
and if you're using a different linux

51
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:34,600
distro and check to see which file
you already have and bearing in

52
00:03:34,600 --> 00:03:39,340
mind maybe called bash_profile
and if you have both been then used .profile

53
00:03:39,340 --> 00:03:43,630
in all cases the file will be in your
home directory I've got a

54
00:03:43,630 --> 00:03:49,690
terminal session already opened so in there we
want to type in gedit...

55
00:03:49,690 --> 00:03:54,220
....because

56
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:59,770
i'm running ubuntu linux and you can see
that it says in the comments there's

57
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:05,440
this file is executed by the command
interpreter for login shells so what

58
00:04:05,440 --> 00:04:08,770
we're going to do is go right down to
the end of the file very last line we're

59
00:04:08,770 --> 00:04:13,230
going to type an extra command to the file
they're we type...

60
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:20,650
....

61
00:04:20,650 --> 00:04:26,320
....next I'm going to paste in the
Android SDK location that i took a copy

62
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,320
of from Android studio by doing a ctrl v

63
00:04:30,290 --> 00:04:33,200
this is the path that's been added
there making sure you don't add any

64
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:37,250
extra spaces which can cause
problems then the other thing we need to

65
00:04:37,250 --> 00:04:42,830
do is we need to put up / again after
that then need to type...

66
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:48,500
....making sure you keep it in lower
case then put a double quote into finish

67
00:04:48,500 --> 00:04:53,300
that line off that's what we need to do
their so i'm going to save the changes and

68
00:04:53,300 --> 00:04:58,250
we can close the file at that point
normally for those changes to take

69
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,370
effect would have to close down would
have to logout rather log back in again

70
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:07,520
alternative to doing that is we can type...

71
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,870
....and bearing in mind for other
distros that might be bash_profile

72
00:05:11,870 --> 00:05:17,450
or even another name but for ubuntu its .profile going to do that and

73
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:20,960
that has reread that in and the only
other thing i really need to do now is

74
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:27,410
type in sql lite 3 so....and this time you can see instead of

75
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:28,130
getting an error

76
00:05:28,130 --> 00:05:31,550
we've actually got the sql lite
command-line interface popping up giving

77
00:05:31,550 --> 00:05:35,690
us a version number and it's actually
actually giving us some tips to get help

78
00:05:35,690 --> 00:05:40,190
etc so that means that we type obviously the right path and sql lite

79
00:05:40,190 --> 00:05:43,370
is now ready to be used in which
we going to be starting using it in the

80
00:05:43,370 --> 00:05:48,290
next video I'm going to type .quit to
get out of that now and for the other

81
00:05:48,290 --> 00:05:51,740
command that we're going to be using
later in the course that's ADB Android

82
00:05:51,740 --> 00:05:56,870
debug bridge we can just type in ADB and you can
see that we've got a whole heap of

83
00:05:56,870 --> 00:06:00,740
mumbo-jumbo there but the bottom line is
it's telling us that ADB is actually

84
00:06:00,740 --> 00:06:05,450
working and it's found it and were able
to use that and later in the course we

85
00:06:05,450 --> 00:06:06,590
are putting that to good use

86
00:06:06,590 --> 00:06:10,190
so the bottom line now is at this point
we're actually done we've got the command

87
00:06:10,190 --> 00:06:14,210
lines set up and we're ready to move on
and start working with sql lite in

88
00:06:14,210 --> 00:06:16,070
the next video I'll see you in the next
video
