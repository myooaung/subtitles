00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:05.770

OK.



2

00:00:05.900 --> 00:00:12.260

So let's have a look at Material Design, which Google introduced originally with Android Lollipop.



3

00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:17.600

Now I want to give you a bit of an overview on what material design is, because Google has been pushing



4

00:00:17.600 --> 00:00:22.850

it now for some time. Certainly since they talked about Android Lollipop initially.



5

00:00:22.850 --> 00:00:27.140

So just why is this such an important part of Android since Lollipop?



6

00:00:27.470 --> 00:00:33.530

Well the concept of a material design is that it's interactive, and designed so that we have a set of



7

00:00:33.530 --> 00:00:40.040

principles or guidelines from Google. And it relates to the look of the applications that we create, and



8

00:00:40.040 --> 00:00:46.060

also how our users, the people playing or downloading and using how apps, interact with those apps.



9

00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:51.470

Material Design is really the stuff for want of a better term, that the buttons, fields and other things



10

00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:53.950

are really constructed with.



11

00:00:54.530 --> 00:00:57.790

So why would we bother using the Material Design principles.



12

00:00:58.130 --> 00:01:02.070

Well it's very cool, and makes your app look and become more engaging.



13

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:07.880

And obviously, if you're using material design, your apps are going to be more blended in, and fit in with



14

00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.340

the look and feel of Android apps in general.



15

00:01:10.670 --> 00:01:13.880

So let's actually check out a couple of really cool apps,



16

00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:18.950

and you can do this whether your device is running Android lollipop or later, or even an earlier version like



17

00:01:18.950 --> 00:01:21.190

KitKat or Jelly Bean.



18

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:26.610

Now one of the good things that Google did with Material Design, was to make it backwards compatible.



19

00:01:26.780 --> 00:01:32.870

So what that means is that we can have our apps running on older devices and still look much like the current



20

00:01:32.870 --> 00:01:37.370

version of Android. So we can retain the colours the styles and so forth,



21

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:40.370

because Google gave us the ability to do that.



22

00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:42.580

So even if you have an older version of Android,



23

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:48.770

check these out anyway, just to see what they look like in an older version, because you'll then know when you're



24

00:01:48.770 --> 00:01:54.390

creating apps using Material Design, that they'll still look pretty cool on older Android versions as well.



25

00:01:54.410 --> 00:01:57.170

So let's actually go ahead and check out these two apps.



26

00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:03.100

Now the apps in question are the Google Play App, and that's the app that you download apps from if you're using Google Play,



27

00:02:03.320 --> 00:02:04.900

and also the Gmail app.



28

00:02:05.030 --> 00:02:09.760

So let's check these out now. I'm going to go through and show you Gmail first.



29

00:02:09.770 --> 00:02:14.600

So this is an example of a pretty cool app, but unfortunately, it's not Open Source. So in other words,



30

00:02:14.600 --> 00:02:18.100

you can't get to the source code to see exactly what they've done,



31

00:02:18.290 --> 00:02:20.150

but they have done it really well though.



32

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:28.430

So here I am in my emulator, so I'm going to start up Gmail. You can see that it's a nice looking up app, and that's



33

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:30.300

what we really are trying to see here.



34

00:02:30.540 --> 00:02:33.430

You've got drawers for starters that opens, and click over here,



35

00:02:33.650 --> 00:02:39.020

the drawer slides across as you can see there, and although you can't see the email address or name associated



36

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:40.350

with this Gmail account,



37

00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.900

you can see various information,



38

00:02:41.940 --> 00:02:47.490

and it's quite a cool looking interface. You can scroll through the various In Box folders and options as well,



39

00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:51.620

so go up and down there, and I can come back here and take that off.



40

00:02:51.830 --> 00:02:54.590

I can scroll down my list of emails,



41

00:02:54.980 --> 00:03:00.070

scroll back up again, and back to settings and go back into here, and we can come down.



42

00:03:00.420 --> 00:03:01.720

There's a dropdown list there.



43

00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.320

We can manage accounts and select additional accounts if we want to,



44

00:03:07.890 --> 00:03:16.410

and come down here to settings. We can find the various settings relating to this account, and going back to the main interface,



45

00:03:16.410 --> 00:03:22.660

again we can click into a particular email. And we've got various toolbars where we can do various things



46

00:03:22.660 --> 00:03:27.540

like delete, archive, and even there's another submenu, we can move it,



47

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:31.540

and all sorts of other things that you'd see in a normal email application.



48

00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.760

So basically it's just a nice looking app and that's what we're really trying to say here.



49

00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.990

So this is like an Android compliant app, and actually one of the first that Google produced using Material



50

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.550

Design, so I really like what they've actually done with it.



51

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:50.110

So let's now close that down. I want to have a look at another one, which is the Google Play Store.



52

00:03:50.130 --> 00:03:57.350

So click over here for Play Store. I'm just going to click on Accept to that, because it's the first time that I've been in there



53

00:03:57.510 --> 00:03:58.610

on my emulator.



54

00:03:59.120 --> 00:04:02.280

So this is the Play Store app and I like the design of this one as well.



55

00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:04.290

So we've got that drawer approach again.



56

00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.450

Click and open it up.



57

00:04:05.460 --> 00:04:10.410

We can open it up and get access to the various options from that, from there if we actually want, so I can go



58

00:04:10.450 --> 00:04:18.440

into My Apps for example over here, and there's also other things like there's a Wishlist capability down here.



59

00:04:18.460 --> 00:04:27.240

We can Wishlist particular apps. We've got options to get into our account settings, and the various apps, games, movies



60

00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:29.820

and TV, music, books and so on.



61

00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.190

I'm not going to bother with a lot of that now,



62

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.190

but just the look of this app I think is pretty neat, and I think it looks great



63

00:04:35.220 --> 00:04:43.020

personally. And if we wanted to we can go into particular apps, go home, click on games for argument's sake, and



64

00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:48.730

click on a particular game and go into there, and we can install apps from there. I can scroll down, scroll



65

00:04:48.730 --> 00:04:56.430

up. We can go back again, and we can swipe over here to move to different categories, which is pretty cool.



66

00:04:56.490 --> 00:05:00.850

And we'll just go back because you don't want to go into there right now, swiping again to the left, to go back where



67

00:05:00.850 --> 00:05:07.080

we were before, and we can also scroll down, not doing too good a job here with the mouse and swiping.



68

00:05:07.410 --> 00:05:09.390

But we'll just go back to where we were, go home.



69

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.010

We've got our apps here,



70

00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:19.030

and click on more, and again we can swipe down, scroll down, swipe to the left or to the right. We can't now because



71

00:05:19.030 --> 00:05:27.150

we've got this fully opened. And also if we just go back, I'll go back up to the top again, we've also got this search



72

00:05:27.150 --> 00:05:36.680

capability here. I could search for something like Clash of Clans, select that, and the tool bar also, if we go



73

00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:37.470

back again.



74

00:05:41.710 --> 00:05:43.870

You can see that the toolbar at the top's raised.



75

00:05:44.110 --> 00:05:47.780

It's meant to be looked at as if it's over the top of the screen.



76

00:05:48.100 --> 00:05:54.100

So the design principles of Material Design have been applied to this app, so it's very easy to use because



77

00:05:54.100 --> 00:05:58.230

things like navigation elements are distinct from the content.



78

00:05:58.540 --> 00:06:02.530

You don't have to stop and think about what you can tap and what you can slide. It all sort of just



79

00:06:02.530 --> 00:06:04.670

makes sense and feels natural.



80

00:06:04.690 --> 00:06:07.230

So it's very much something that people are used to.



81

00:06:07.270 --> 00:06:10.480

So they'll expect the same sort of interface when using your app,



82

00:06:10.480 --> 00:06:11.470

that's the bottom line,



83

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:15.840

and consequently if you're using Material Design in your app, it's going to fit in quite nicely.



84

00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:16.600

So there you go.



85

00:06:16.600 --> 00:06:21.820

That's just a quick overview, and definitely worthwhile checking if you're running Android Lollipop or above



86

00:06:21.820 --> 00:06:23.460

or on your physical Android device.



87

00:06:23.680 --> 00:06:26.510

But even if you aren't, you can see that I'm running it on an emulator.



88

00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:31.450

Still check these apps out, because on the previous versions of Android Kit Kat or whatever you're running,



89

00:06:31.750 --> 00:06:33.540

those apps have still been updated.



90

00:06:33.810 --> 00:06:38.620

Now obviously you won't have all the Material Design in those older versions, but you still



91

00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.660

will see that the look is very much the same. OK so let's move on.



92

00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:47.120

The next thing that's a good point of reference is Google's website.



93

00:06:47.190 --> 00:06:50.360

Now you can google material design specsheet, which I'm going to do,



94

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:58.620

or even material design, and you'll get to the following page.



95

00:06:58.660 --> 00:07:00.040

You'll get this page here, material dot



96

00:07:00.150 --> 00:07:02.370

io forward slash guidelines.



97

00:07:05.940 --> 00:07:10.660

So basically it's Google's sort of a manifesto, for want of a better term, on what Material Design's



98

00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:11.450

all about.



99

00:07:11.650 --> 00:07:15.400

So let's just have a look at that in a little bit more detail now.



100

00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:21.910

Now Google have created this material.io domain to host their Material Design content,



101

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:28.840

so this is actually a Google site. But just going back to the Google search engine again, I can do a



102

00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:33.170

search also for material design.



103

00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:38.110

You can see we get the sight where our material.io guidelines, and that's where we were, so



104

00:07:38.230 --> 00:07:43.300

again this is an official Google site just in case you're wondering. So I'm just going to go back now into the



105

00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:45.910

guidelines.



106

00:07:46.250 --> 00:07:51.470

Now you certainly don't need to know everything that's on this site, but it can be a really good way



107

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:56.930

to introduce yourself to the concepts of Material Design at a high level, and you can always come back



108

00:07:56.930 --> 00:07:59.420

and go into more detail at a later time.



109

00:07:59.420 --> 00:08:04.400

Now this is an overview of what Material Design is and what it's all about.



110

00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:06.910

Now the website doesn't talk about programming.



111

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:12.680

It's more the concept of the layout, or the concepts of the layouts. So it goes into the sizing of various parts



112

00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:15.510

of the screen in density independent pixels,



113

00:08:15.560 --> 00:08:18.090

suggestions for margins and that sort of thing.



114

00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:23.250

So it's more of a graphical user interface type of thing, rather than a programming thing.



115

00:08:23.470 --> 00:08:28.220

Now it's also worth noting that it covers design for Chromebook as well as Android,



116

00:08:28.430 --> 00:08:33.350

and in fact the Material Design principles have been applied to this website as well.



117

00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:39.480

So as an example of that, watch what happens when I scroll down the page. Notice how we've got the toolbar at the top there.



118

00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:42.940

So basically it collapses to make more room for the content,



119

00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:46.970

and that's something you can actually do as well in your Android apps.



120

00:08:47.300 --> 00:08:51.800

So let's just go through quickly and click a few things. So I can actually select from the menu to the left



121

00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:52.500

here.



122

00:08:53.110 --> 00:08:54.950

A good place to start is Layout



123

00:08:54.950 --> 00:08:56.670

so I'm going to click on that,



124

00:08:57.020 --> 00:09:02.400

and once you get on there click on, or once that opens I should say, click on Principles.



125

00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:06.260

So this actually shows Google's interpretation.



126

00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:12.740

So they refer to screens effectively as paper, and the elements that you're drawing on top of, are actually



127

00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:14.430

on top of a piece of paper.



128

00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:21.710

So the analogy is that the screen is paper, and they're giving you overviews as we scroll down, of toolbars,



129

00:09:21.930 --> 00:09:23.860

what the menu options should be,



130

00:09:24.140 --> 00:09:29.130

Seams as you can see there, the various steps, Floating Action Buttons and so on.



131

00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:34.460

Now although nothing's explicitly stated in our apps, how many app developers have written detailed



132

00:09:34.460 --> 00:09:38.320

instructions, and who bothers reading instruction manuals anyway.



133

00:09:38.460 --> 00:09:41.740

Users quickly get used to the visual cues without thinking about it.



134

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:47.810

Now these Seams and Steps though, if you go back to those again, Seams and Steps as you can see there, they give a good



135

00:09:47.810 --> 00:09:52.380

visual indication of the behavior you can expect when you interact with them.



136

00:09:52.620 --> 00:09:58.810

I'm going to come over here and click on Structure on the left hand menu. So as we go down the page here



137

00:09:58.820 --> 00:10:06.570

now, they go into more and more detail and give you some good dos and don'ts. So it'll really help you solidify



138

00:10:06.570 --> 00:10:09.740

your understanding of what material design is,



139

00:10:09.840 --> 00:10:14.620

if you take the time to go through this website. Now it does get into all sorts of details,



140

00:10:14.720 --> 00:10:21.760

even for example that toolbars, if you scroll down to that section, toolbars down here as you can see, it talks about



141

00:10:21.790 --> 00:10:27.510

toolbars having a standard height of 56 density independent pixels on a mobile. Now there are



142

00:10:27.510 --> 00:10:32.590

good reasons for a lot of this. An average human finger, when it taps a screen,



143

00:10:32.810 --> 00:10:35.200

will tap an area about 48 dp,



144

00:10:35.450 --> 00:10:39.210

and that's why we set that as the minimum size for our buttons in the calculator app.



145

00:10:39.450 --> 00:10:43.340

So it's good to have a one stop shop to find out about these things.



146

00:10:43.620 --> 00:10:49.210

So as we get through the course and we create apps, I'll probably be referring back to here as appropriate,



147

00:10:49.300 --> 00:10:52.740

and I'll be reminding you of some of the guidelines and so forth.



148

00:10:52.890 --> 00:10:57.540

So really this is a good website to give you some of the principles, but there's lots more details on



149

00:10:57.540 --> 00:11:01.530

this site. So we can go to Style for example, up here,



150

00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:09.150

and have a look at the colour page. Now with the introduction of Android Lollipop,



151

00:11:09.230 --> 00:11:15.140

Google brightened everything up and made the screens more vibrant, and that's carried on through to Marshmallow,



152

00:11:15.140 --> 00:11:17.960

Nougat and now into Android



153

00:11:17.990 --> 00:11:24.120

Oreo. Screens are very vibrant and bright and the colours are chosen to work well together.



154

00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:28.730

So if I scroll down this page a little bit, Google have created this colour palette.



155

00:11:29.170 --> 00:11:31.380

I see I can click it from here to get there quickly,



156

00:11:33.300 --> 00:11:36.210

and these are colours that have been chosen to work well together.



157

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:41.980

Now if you're into creating your own graphics, using perhaps Adobe Illustrator or Photoshop,



158

00:11:42.310 --> 00:11:47.300

then you can actually download a zip file containing colour swatches for use in those programs.



159

00:11:47.570 --> 00:11:53.720

But back in the top of the video, there's this video, and it's fairly short and it's a pallette



160

00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:57.590

perfect video showing how Google intended the colours to be used.



161

00:11:57.680 --> 00:12:02.300

Now it runs for less than two minutes so it's worth a look, and it does a good job of explaining the meaning



162

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:05.330

of those numbers on the left hand side of each color.



163

00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:08.590

So I'm going to play this video because it's a great introduction,



164

00:12:08.660 --> 00:12:10.340

so let's go ahead and play that now.



165

00:12:19.330 --> 00:12:25.330

There are no wrong colours. What matters most is how you use them, but with such a broad spectrum to choose from,



166

00:12:25.330 --> 00:12:28.420

how do you know which colours will work for you?



167

00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:35.540

The Material Design palette provides a simple smart approach to building with colour. Starting with the



168

00:12:35.550 --> 00:12:43.040

primary 500s, it scales from light to dark, offering a variety of carefully chosen values. These colour ranges are then



169

00:12:43.040 --> 00:12:44.980

applied to different elements in the



170

00:12:44.990 --> 00:12:54.670

UI. The 500s are perfect for describing the dominant theme in your product, and are great for toolbox. From there, scale up to the 700s



171

00:12:54.690 --> 00:12:59.240

for status box, or down to 300 for secondary information.



172

00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:05.840

Accent colours are brighter and more saturating. They encourage user interaction, giving your



173

00:13:06.430 --> 00:13:06.990

UI subtle but considered colour pops. They are perfect for



174

00:13:10.770 --> 00:13:11.830

highlighting primary



175

00:13:15.420 --> 00:13:16.010

action buttons, or fabs, standard buttons, switches, sliders and more.



176

00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:21.130

This system for thinking about colour is powerful, immersive and completely adaptable to any application.



177

00:13:25.580 --> 00:13:28.540

Whether your brand is poppy and bright or seriously subdued, Material Design makes colour work for you.



178

00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:36.990

Start building. Get to know the fundamentals of colour in google.com/design.



179

00:13:41.380 --> 00:13:44.880

Alright so I'm going to finish the video here at this point. In the next video,



180

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:49.000

we'll talk a little more about Material Design and then we're going to make a start on using some of



181

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:51.180

the concepts in our Flickr app.



182

00:13:51.190 --> 00:13:52.580

So I'll see you in the next video.
