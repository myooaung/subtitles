1
00:00:04,700 --> 00:00:07,370
Alright so continuing on before we

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:08,540
actually get into the layout designer

3
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:10,549
you want to make sure that Android

4
00:00:10,549 --> 00:00:13,099
studio is using the Android view for the

5
00:00:13,099 --> 00:00:15,230
project pane. So to see whether your own

6
00:00:15,230 --> 00:00:16,400
come over here to the left-hand

7
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:18,890
pane here and by the way if you've got a

8
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:20,539
screen that looks similar to that just

9
00:00:20,539 --> 00:00:23,029
click on the project tab to open up the

10
00:00:23,029 --> 00:00:25,070
pane there and you want to make sure

11
00:00:25,070 --> 00:00:27,320
that Android is selected if you're in a

12
00:00:27,320 --> 00:00:28,640
different view things may look a little

13
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:30,739
bit different so you want to make sure

14
00:00:30,739 --> 00:00:33,469
that you're an Android view which is the

15
00:00:33,469 --> 00:00:35,480
usually the best view to be in when

16
00:00:35,480 --> 00:00:37,220
you're actually working with Android

17
00:00:37,220 --> 00:00:39,860
code you can work in project view if you

18
00:00:39,860 --> 00:00:41,300
prefer but some of the dialogues that

19
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,220
appear when creating layouts for example

20
00:00:43,220 --> 00:00:45,410
actually are different in the two views

21
00:00:45,410 --> 00:00:47,420
and I'm going to mainly be using Android

22
00:00:47,420 --> 00:00:49,400
view for this course and we'll let me

23
00:00:49,400 --> 00:00:50,720
switch to project view when it's

24
00:00:50,720 --> 00:00:52,520
necessary to work with a few files that

25
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,040
don't appear in Android view alright so

26
00:00:55,040 --> 00:00:56,600
now that everything's set up we need to

27
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,120
go to the res folder and expand layout

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:01,360
I'm gonna open it up

29
00:01:01,360 --> 00:01:03,530
he's the res folder I could expand that

30
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:05,360
and there's our layout folder you

31
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,380
explained that as well

32
00:01:06,380 --> 00:01:08,540
now this res folder by the way is where

33
00:01:08,540 --> 00:01:10,819
all the apps resources things like

34
00:01:10,819 --> 00:01:13,729
images and so forth live so it's the

35
00:01:13,729 --> 00:01:15,530
files in here including all the

36
00:01:15,530 --> 00:01:17,719
subfolders that can't have capital

37
00:01:17,719 --> 00:01:19,520
letters in their names now I'm going to

38
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:21,499
start by opening this activity and it's

39
00:01:21,499 --> 00:01:23,359
called main dot XML file by double

40
00:01:23,359 --> 00:01:26,149
clicking it now I could have just click

41
00:01:26,149 --> 00:01:27,679
this tab at the top here if I wanted to

42
00:01:27,679 --> 00:01:31,280
instead but if you close it you may need

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:32,479
to know how to open it again and that's

44
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:34,999
how by double clicking it over here so

45
00:01:34,999 --> 00:01:36,319
when you'll get the layout designer with

46
00:01:36,319 --> 00:01:39,439
a design and a blueprint now on a small

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,729
screen you can toggle them on and off

48
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,289
using these two buttons up the top of

49
00:01:42,289 --> 00:01:46,340
you your design and blueprint so I can

50
00:01:46,340 --> 00:01:49,549
select just design or just blueprint or

51
00:01:49,549 --> 00:01:52,609
design and blueprint so depending on how

52
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:53,929
much screen real estate you've got you

53
00:01:53,929 --> 00:01:58,359
may or may not want to turn those off

54
00:01:58,359 --> 00:02:00,679
now the icons on these buttons by the

55
00:02:00,679 --> 00:02:02,149
way have changed from the previous

56
00:02:02,149 --> 00:02:04,159
versions of Android studio and there's

57
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:05,599
nothing to say that they won't change

58
00:02:05,599 --> 00:02:07,459
again now if you hover your mouse

59
00:02:07,459 --> 00:02:09,050
pointer over any of the buttons though

60
00:02:09,050 --> 00:02:10,610
you'll get a tooltip to briefly

61
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:12,860
describes what they do and that can be a

62
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:14,180
very good way to make sure that you're

63
00:02:14,180 --> 00:02:16,099
clicking the button you want whatever

64
00:02:16,099 --> 00:02:18,980
icon it happens to use so I can hover over that

65
00:02:18,980 --> 00:02:21,840
select design surface as you can see and

66
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:23,280
I can either click on it there and that

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,230
brings up the little pop-up menu and

68
00:02:25,230 --> 00:02:27,720
choose which one I want this click

69
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:28,890
somewhere else to actually get rid of

70
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:30,960
the New Year menu all right so that's

71
00:02:30,960 --> 00:02:32,280
very useful if you want to experiment

72
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:33,750
with things but we're going to be

73
00:02:33,750 --> 00:02:35,160
looking at most of the buttons on the

74
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:37,500
toolbar anyway so as well as toggling

75
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:39,810
off either the design or the blueprint

76
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:41,940
we can also make more room by closing

77
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:44,280
the project pane and that leaves a more

78
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:46,260
screen space for our layout so I

79
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:47,820
normally do close up when working on the

80
00:02:47,820 --> 00:02:50,460
layout designer only come over here just

81
00:02:50,460 --> 00:02:52,530
click on the project tab bear to the

82
00:02:52,530 --> 00:02:54,810
left and that gives us the in this case

83
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:57,360
the designer and the blueprint showing

84
00:02:57,360 --> 00:02:59,340
on screen at once again we can come up

85
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:01,710
here if we wanted to and toggle to have

86
00:03:01,710 --> 00:03:03,600
either one of them or both of them I'm

87
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:05,910
gonna leave both of them on so make sure

88
00:03:05,910 --> 00:03:07,680
now that tell you have got your screen

89
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,750
set up like mine with both the design

90
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:11,520
and the blueprints showing we're going

91
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:13,620
to talk about what they are so firstly

92
00:03:13,620 --> 00:03:15,360
the designer then it looks like a real

93
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:17,850
phone because you're a preview of what

94
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:19,290
your design is going to look like when

95
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:21,030
you run the app so that's this one

96
00:03:21,030 --> 00:03:22,980
obviously on the left hand side now the

97
00:03:22,980 --> 00:03:24,240
one on the right hand side well that's

98
00:03:24,240 --> 00:03:26,370
the blueprint so think of that as a sort

99
00:03:26,370 --> 00:03:28,740
of schematic diagram so it shows the a

100
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:30,420
relative position of things in the

101
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:32,160
layout but doesn't attempt to show

102
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:34,380
exactly what they look like everything

103
00:03:34,380 --> 00:03:37,050
is represented in the blueprint by an

104
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:39,270
outline now there's an important side

105
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:41,280
effect as a result of this the

106
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,230
computer's got much less work to do when

107
00:03:43,230 --> 00:03:45,450
it renders the blueprint compared to

108
00:03:45,450 --> 00:03:47,640
rendering the designer so that means

109
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:49,680
that you'll find things work smoother if

110
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:52,200
you use the blueprint to layout your design

111
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:54,360
especially on a slow computer or one

112
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:56,760
without much memory now in this version

113
00:03:56,760 --> 00:03:58,500
of Android studio the blueprint also

114
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:01,050
shows the constraints all the time and

115
00:04:01,050 --> 00:04:02,280
that's these little zipper things that

116
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,730
you can see here to the right hand side

117
00:04:04,730 --> 00:04:06,840
where it's in the designer they only

118
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,370
appear when you move their mouse into

119
00:04:08,370 --> 00:04:10,860
the design and you can see now that um

120
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:12,990
in the designer it's not showing them

121
00:04:12,990 --> 00:04:14,910
soon as I move away they disappear now

122
00:04:14,910 --> 00:04:16,440
for that reason if you have a problem

123
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:18,060
and want to provide a screen shot when

124
00:04:18,060 --> 00:04:19,680
you post a question in the Q&A section

125
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:21,750
of this course it'll make our job much

126
00:04:21,750 --> 00:04:24,360
easier if you include the blueprint in

127
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:27,330
the screenshot now personally I normally

128
00:04:27,330 --> 00:04:29,669
work with just the blueprint and toggle

129
00:04:29,669 --> 00:04:30,960
the designer on what I want to check

130
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:32,389
what it looks like

131
00:04:32,389 --> 00:04:33,590
so I could sit quietly for this video

132
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:34,699
I'm actually going to leave them both

133
00:04:34,699 --> 00:04:36,439
showing in these in this video and

134
00:04:36,439 --> 00:04:37,789
future videos in this section of the

135
00:04:37,789 --> 00:04:40,189
course okay so the other button that I

136
00:04:40,189 --> 00:04:41,360
want to mention for now is the auto

137
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:43,699
connect button and that's the button in

138
00:04:43,699 --> 00:04:45,259
the tool bar that looks a lot like a

139
00:04:45,259 --> 00:04:47,479
magnet you can see this one over here

140
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:48,979
I'm just gonna hover my toolbar up my

141
00:04:48,979 --> 00:04:50,840
mouse over the toolbar don't see the

142
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:52,939
toolbar tip you can see that if I hover

143
00:04:52,939 --> 00:04:55,909
over it it says turn on auto connect now

144
00:04:55,909 --> 00:04:58,129
this can be a nice feature but it can

145
00:04:58,129 --> 00:05:01,370
sometimes be annoying at the moment you

146
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:02,659
can see that it was turned off because

147
00:05:02,659 --> 00:05:04,699
I've got the option now to hover over to

148
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:06,889
turn on auto connect and you can see

149
00:05:06,889 --> 00:05:08,870
that when I've clicked it the slash that

150
00:05:08,870 --> 00:05:10,370
was through the magnet has now

151
00:05:10,370 --> 00:05:11,689
disappeared and that's telling me that

152
00:05:11,689 --> 00:05:13,729
that's no on if I hover my mouse over

153
00:05:13,729 --> 00:05:16,069
there again to toggle I can turn off or

154
00:05:16,069 --> 00:05:17,689
I connect there's a little slash

155
00:05:17,689 --> 00:05:18,949
set-piece through them through the

156
00:05:18,949 --> 00:05:21,169
picture of a magnet now but I'm actually

157
00:05:21,169 --> 00:05:22,819
gonna leave it on for the moment though

158
00:05:22,819 --> 00:05:25,159
by clicking on it again and we'll see

159
00:05:25,159 --> 00:05:27,319
what it does in a minute but let's start

160
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:29,060
out by getting rid of the holo world

161
00:05:29,060 --> 00:05:31,129
text view widget so I'm gonna select it

162
00:05:31,129 --> 00:05:33,650
by clicking on either the images so

163
00:05:33,650 --> 00:05:35,509
either the image is in the designer or

164
00:05:35,509 --> 00:05:37,759
the blueprint or alternatively I could

165
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,129
also do that in the componentry then my

166
00:05:40,129 --> 00:05:41,539
component tree is not showing at the

167
00:05:41,539 --> 00:05:43,460
moment so I'm come down here and click

168
00:05:43,460 --> 00:05:45,560
on this little option here and that will

169
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:47,539
show that the component tree which is a

170
00:05:47,539 --> 00:05:50,870
list of views that are in our design so

171
00:05:50,870 --> 00:05:52,490
to delete the hello world I can click

172
00:05:52,490 --> 00:05:55,129
either of these or I could also click

173
00:05:55,129 --> 00:05:56,389
over there but noting that that's now

174
00:05:56,389 --> 00:05:58,339
highlighted in the component tree when

175
00:05:58,339 --> 00:06:00,680
I've clicked that incidentally clicking

176
00:06:00,680 --> 00:06:02,330
on the space outside the images and

177
00:06:02,330 --> 00:06:04,699
deselects it so if you ever want to

178
00:06:04,699 --> 00:06:07,159
deselect something just do that and you

179
00:06:07,159 --> 00:06:09,080
can see that no matter which way I click

180
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:10,729
I can get it selected and it updates

181
00:06:10,729 --> 00:06:13,490
either the component tree or the

182
00:06:13,490 --> 00:06:15,349
designer and or blueprint depending what

183
00:06:15,349 --> 00:06:17,569
you've got on the screen so making sure

184
00:06:17,569 --> 00:06:19,520
that you've - you've selected the text

185
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:22,610
view widget I just want to talk about

186
00:06:22,610 --> 00:06:25,819
briefly about this blueprint and how if

187
00:06:25,819 --> 00:06:27,020
you look really carefully it almost

188
00:06:27,020 --> 00:06:29,479
appears that the blueprint looks a bit

189
00:06:29,479 --> 00:06:31,909
like a pair of punk-rock denim jeans and

190
00:06:31,909 --> 00:06:35,089
the zippers also appear when I move my

191
00:06:35,089 --> 00:06:36,349
mouse over the design we talked about

192
00:06:36,349 --> 00:06:38,689
that term before but what we're going to

193
00:06:38,689 --> 00:06:40,459
do now is delete this and to do that I'm

194
00:06:40,459 --> 00:06:41,630
just going to press the del key on my

195
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:43,759
keyboard and you can see that's now

196
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,160
removed it from the designer the blueprint

197
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:48,890
and also from the componentry alright so

198
00:06:48,890 --> 00:06:50,660
we're going to add an image view so what

199
00:06:50,660 --> 00:06:52,040
we need to do is use your operating

200
00:06:52,040 --> 00:06:54,110
systems File Manager to find the JPEG

201
00:06:54,110 --> 00:06:55,790
files that we talked about previously

202
00:06:55,790 --> 00:06:58,690
that you hopefully have downloaded by now

203
00:06:58,690 --> 00:07:01,040
now I actually downloaded both of them

204
00:07:01,040 --> 00:07:03,380
to my desktop so I'm just going to open

205
00:07:03,380 --> 00:07:07,070
up finder on my Mac go to my desktop and

206
00:07:07,070 --> 00:07:08,600
I'm actually created a subfolder called

207
00:07:08,600 --> 00:07:11,540
images and if I just bring this over

208
00:07:11,540 --> 00:07:12,740
into the window now you can see that

209
00:07:12,740 --> 00:07:13,940
I've got my two images showing their

210
00:07:13,940 --> 00:07:16,520
ball underscore 100 by 100 and ball

211
00:07:16,520 --> 00:07:20,300
underscore 640 by 480 so what I'm going

212
00:07:20,300 --> 00:07:21,890
to do now is select both of those files

213
00:07:21,890 --> 00:07:23,960
I'm going to right click those and

214
00:07:23,960 --> 00:07:26,600
select copy and obviously if you're on a

215
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,040
Windows or Linux machine you'll do

216
00:07:28,040 --> 00:07:30,440
whatever it was similar in probably ctrl

217
00:07:30,440 --> 00:07:33,530
C on Windows or Linux we want to copy

218
00:07:33,530 --> 00:07:35,060
those and we want to paste them directly

219
00:07:35,060 --> 00:07:38,180
into our project and to do that we go

220
00:07:38,180 --> 00:07:40,520
back into Android studio now in my case

221
00:07:40,520 --> 00:07:42,230
because I've closed the project pane I'm

222
00:07:42,230 --> 00:07:44,090
going to open that and we're going to

223
00:07:44,090 --> 00:07:46,160
make sure that I'm in the res folder and

224
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:47,510
then we're down here won't expand the

225
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:48,680
drawable folder because that's actually

226
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:49,970
where we want to paste them somewhere

227
00:07:49,970 --> 00:07:52,970
right click on this drawable folder and

228
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:57,380
choose paste and it's asking whether

229
00:07:57,380 --> 00:07:58,910
we're sure that I'm sure that I want to

230
00:07:58,910 --> 00:08:00,560
copy those files into the folder that's

231
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:01,850
going to be going into you can see there

232
00:08:01,850 --> 00:08:02,360
at the end

233
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:04,730
res drawable I want to click on OK

234
00:08:04,730 --> 00:08:06,800
because I want to do that and noting now

235
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:08,570
that the two files have now appeared in

236
00:08:08,570 --> 00:08:11,090
the drawable folder and obviously you

237
00:08:11,090 --> 00:08:13,100
can confirm there that both those files

238
00:08:13,100 --> 00:08:15,140
haven't got any capital letters in the

239
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:17,300
filenames and I knew that but if you

240
00:08:17,300 --> 00:08:18,410
happen to be using uranium which is

241
00:08:18,410 --> 00:08:19,910
again just to reminder not to use

242
00:08:19,910 --> 00:08:21,380
capital letters if you're using your own

243
00:08:21,380 --> 00:08:24,260
images alright and I've got the drawable

244
00:08:24,260 --> 00:08:25,610
folder and expanded we can see that

245
00:08:25,610 --> 00:08:26,750
those two files are there are they

246
00:08:26,750 --> 00:08:29,090
showing there so what I'm going to do is

247
00:08:29,090 --> 00:08:31,370
make some more space by shrinking the

248
00:08:31,370 --> 00:08:32,690
project pane so let's go ahead and do

249
00:08:32,690 --> 00:08:33,110
that again

250
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:35,000
clicking on project to close it down

251
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:36,620
leaving just a constraint layout to the

252
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,000
left and also our designer and blueprint

253
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,370
views now the image view widget is in

254
00:08:43,370 --> 00:08:45,440
the images section in the widget palette

255
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,330
now the palettes not open for me at the

256
00:08:47,330 --> 00:08:48,410
moment I'm going to click on this option

257
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:50,900
here little tab and you can see that

258
00:08:50,900 --> 00:08:53,840
that brings the palette open and that

259
00:08:53,840 --> 00:08:56,330
will also toggle so I can click on and

260
00:08:56,330 --> 00:08:58,339
click on it again to actually hard if

261
00:08:58,339 --> 00:08:59,439
you want to do that

262
00:08:59,439 --> 00:09:00,970
and to harder the game just incidental

263
00:09:00,970 --> 00:09:02,439
if you want to close up once you've

264
00:09:02,439 --> 00:09:03,519
opened you can just click on that little

265
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:05,619
button there and that closes it down I'm

266
00:09:05,619 --> 00:09:06,729
going to leave it open because what we

267
00:09:06,729 --> 00:09:08,589
want to do is get access to the image

268
00:09:08,589 --> 00:09:10,629
view widget as I mentioned it's in the

269
00:09:10,629 --> 00:09:13,359
images section over here to the left and

270
00:09:13,359 --> 00:09:14,949
click on images and you can see there's

271
00:09:14,949 --> 00:09:18,099
our image view widget so once I've done

272
00:09:18,099 --> 00:09:19,149
that I'm going to hold down my left

273
00:09:19,149 --> 00:09:20,499
mouse oh I'm gonna drag it as I would

274
00:09:20,499 --> 00:09:23,529
normally drag an item on a computer you

275
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,119
can just drag it and drop it either on

276
00:09:25,119 --> 00:09:27,669
the design or the blueprint note that

277
00:09:27,669 --> 00:09:29,289
Android studio cleverly shows its

278
00:09:29,289 --> 00:09:31,419
position on both the design and the

279
00:09:31,419 --> 00:09:33,189
blueprint so I'm gonna start by dropping

280
00:09:33,189 --> 00:09:36,369
it in the top left-hand corner now

281
00:09:36,369 --> 00:09:38,049
notice that line or notice the lines

282
00:09:38,049 --> 00:09:40,149
that will appear once I get close to the

283
00:09:40,149 --> 00:09:43,239
top of left edges and you can see now

284
00:09:43,239 --> 00:09:44,919
that we've got a line a horizontal and a

285
00:09:44,919 --> 00:09:47,379
vertical line just in the top left hand

286
00:09:47,379 --> 00:09:48,909
corner of the image and I'm still

287
00:09:48,909 --> 00:09:50,259
holding my down my mouse button at this

288
00:09:50,259 --> 00:09:52,329
point and I'm gonna release the mouse

289
00:09:52,329 --> 00:09:56,470
button now once I do that you'll get to

290
00:09:56,470 --> 00:09:59,319
this pop-up this resources dialog now

291
00:09:59,319 --> 00:10:01,329
what I can do I can either start typing

292
00:10:01,329 --> 00:10:03,099
the name of the image in this case ball

293
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:05,229
and the box at the top or I can scroll

294
00:10:05,229 --> 00:10:07,089
down and find the image that I'm looking

295
00:10:07,089 --> 00:10:08,589
for and obviously in this case we've

296
00:10:08,589 --> 00:10:10,389
only got a few images and though they're

297
00:10:10,389 --> 00:10:11,769
appearing right at the top here but in a

298
00:10:11,769 --> 00:10:13,359
complex project you might have to do

299
00:10:13,359 --> 00:10:15,759
some scrolling to find it and father I

300
00:10:15,759 --> 00:10:17,049
want to click it there's a neat preview

301
00:10:17,049 --> 00:10:18,220
that will show up to the right-hand side

302
00:10:18,220 --> 00:10:20,169
that actually shows you what the image

303
00:10:20,169 --> 00:10:21,759
is going to look like and confirms the

304
00:10:21,759 --> 00:10:24,100
picture itself so what I'm going to do

305
00:10:24,100 --> 00:10:26,799
first is click on the ball 640 by 480

306
00:10:26,799 --> 00:10:27,819
that's the one that were going to be

307
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:30,749
using at this point I'm going to click on ok,

308
00:10:30,749 --> 00:10:33,220
we should find the image you know

309
00:10:33,220 --> 00:10:35,139
appears which it has in the designer and

310
00:10:35,139 --> 00:10:38,499
the blueprint now it's top left corner

311
00:10:38,499 --> 00:10:39,850
will be roughly where we dropped the

312
00:10:39,850 --> 00:10:41,529
image view when you first dragged it

313
00:10:41,529 --> 00:10:44,139
onto the layout now one of the things

314
00:10:44,139 --> 00:10:45,879
that has changed a few times is the

315
00:10:45,879 --> 00:10:48,069
exact behavior when you drop an image

316
00:10:48,069 --> 00:10:50,709
onto the layout the point here is that

317
00:10:50,709 --> 00:10:52,449
you're learning how this layout designer

318
00:10:52,449 --> 00:10:54,939
works and how to create layouts that

319
00:10:54,939 --> 00:10:57,309
look like what you want so you might get

320
00:10:57,309 --> 00:10:58,869
slightly different behavior on your

321
00:10:58,869 --> 00:11:01,149
screen at first but that's fine we're

322
00:11:01,149 --> 00:11:01,989
going to be looking at how you can

323
00:11:01,989 --> 00:11:03,669
position things exactly where you want

324
00:11:03,669 --> 00:11:05,470
them so don't worry if things do look a

325
00:11:05,470 --> 00:11:07,569
little bit different at the moment so

326
00:11:07,569 --> 00:11:09,159
over in the top right here is what used

327
00:11:09,159 --> 00:11:11,319
to be called the inspector so I'll

328
00:11:11,319 --> 00:11:12,720
continue calling it that

329
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:14,189
you can see that there's constraints set

330
00:11:14,189 --> 00:11:16,379
to the left and to the top here got

331
00:11:16,379 --> 00:11:17,939
these little lines that hover to the top

332
00:11:17,939 --> 00:11:20,040
and then to the left but they were set

333
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:22,500
automatically and they reflect the lines

334
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:24,420
that appeared when I dropped the image

335
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:26,430
all right so what I'm gonna do is delete

336
00:11:26,430 --> 00:11:27,480
that image for you and then I'm going to

337
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,370
go through it again to show how that

338
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:31,230
behavior changes depending on where you

339
00:11:31,230 --> 00:11:33,449
initially drop the widget so I'm going

340
00:11:33,449 --> 00:11:36,240
to select the image view I can select it

341
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:39,029
either with the either by clicking on

342
00:11:39,029 --> 00:11:40,709
the image view in the component tree or

343
00:11:40,709 --> 00:11:42,420
by selecting the image anywhere from the

344
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:44,579
designer or the blueprint and then I'm

345
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:46,319
going to press Delete on the del button

346
00:11:46,319 --> 00:11:48,480
and that removes it from our screen as

347
00:11:48,480 --> 00:11:50,639
you can see now this time what I'm going

348
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,379
to do is drop the image view widget at

349
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:54,000
the center of the screen I'm going to

350
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:57,569
grab it again I think I write down right

351
00:11:57,569 --> 00:12:00,240
down to the center of the screen noting

352
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:01,439
that I've moved it around a little bit

353
00:12:01,439 --> 00:12:02,879
until it if the lines at the top left

354
00:12:02,879 --> 00:12:05,040
right and below we knew we got the four

355
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:07,110
lines showing on the screen there so

356
00:12:07,110 --> 00:12:08,490
basically what that means is with those

357
00:12:08,490 --> 00:12:09,959
lines showing both the vertical the

358
00:12:09,959 --> 00:12:11,490
horizontal line sort of going through

359
00:12:11,490 --> 00:12:13,350
the image that should mean that the

360
00:12:13,350 --> 00:12:15,029
image is now centered vertically as well

361
00:12:15,029 --> 00:12:17,129
as horizontally so I'm going to release

362
00:12:17,129 --> 00:12:19,350
the mouse it's going to ask us for the

363
00:12:19,350 --> 00:12:21,480
name again I'm gonna choose ball

364
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,180
underscore 640 by 480 and I'm gonna

365
00:12:24,180 --> 00:12:27,959
click on OK now the difference is quite

366
00:12:27,959 --> 00:12:30,930
subtle but this time is constraints in

367
00:12:30,930 --> 00:12:33,000
all four edges you can see over here in

368
00:12:33,000 --> 00:12:36,000
the inspector top left bottom right have

369
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:38,459
all got lines then notice I said don't

370
00:12:38,459 --> 00:12:39,870
worry too much if your screen doesn't

371
00:12:39,870 --> 00:12:42,240
much doesn't match mine exactly we're

372
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:43,350
going to see how to create these

373
00:12:43,350 --> 00:12:45,209
constraints rather than relying on them

374
00:12:45,209 --> 00:12:47,790
being created automatically and in fact

375
00:12:47,790 --> 00:12:48,899
I'm also going to explain what

376
00:12:48,899 --> 00:12:50,850
constraints are because I've used that

377
00:12:50,850 --> 00:12:52,350
word a few times now and really haven't

378
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:54,809
explained what it means in fact it may

379
00:12:54,809 --> 00:12:56,189
not even be apparent to you what I'm

380
00:12:56,189 --> 00:12:58,740
referring to so let's delete them now

381
00:12:58,740 --> 00:13:00,089
there's a couple of ways to delete

382
00:13:00,089 --> 00:13:02,100
constraints we can either do it in the

383
00:13:02,100 --> 00:13:05,220
layout or in the inspector so what I'm

384
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:06,750
going to do is delete the top constraint

385
00:13:06,750 --> 00:13:08,850
by clicking on this circular constraint

386
00:13:08,850 --> 00:13:11,160
handle as you can see this up here in

387
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:13,220
the middle of the image views top edge

388
00:13:13,220 --> 00:13:15,209
you notice that when I hovered over

389
00:13:15,209 --> 00:13:16,519
there with a mouse have turned to red

390
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,870
and after a few seconds the tooltip

391
00:13:18,870 --> 00:13:20,939
appears saying delete connection now

392
00:13:20,939 --> 00:13:22,380
that only happens if you selected the

393
00:13:22,380 --> 00:13:24,779
widget so if you don't see those circles

394
00:13:24,779 --> 00:13:26,520
click on the image of you first to

395
00:13:26,520 --> 00:13:28,110
select the image view and then hover

396
00:13:28,110 --> 00:13:30,840
your mouse over to the constraint and I

397
00:13:30,840 --> 00:13:32,160
can press the del button to actually

398
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,930
delete that constraint or I can just

399
00:13:33,930 --> 00:13:36,090
click on it again and by clicking on it

400
00:13:36,090 --> 00:13:38,430
that actually deletes the constraint so

401
00:13:38,430 --> 00:13:39,990
you can see that the image moved out a

402
00:13:39,990 --> 00:13:42,150
little bit and the line that was

403
00:13:42,150 --> 00:13:43,740
appearing here in the inspector has now

404
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,350
disappeared okay so it's deleted the

405
00:13:46,350 --> 00:13:48,780
connection and we can see there's no

406
00:13:48,780 --> 00:13:50,640
longer a constraint set in the inspector

407
00:13:50,640 --> 00:13:52,650
it's in fact we've new only got three

408
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:54,900
constraints at the left right and bottom

409
00:13:54,900 --> 00:13:57,050
of the widget so you can see them here

410
00:13:57,050 --> 00:14:01,350
these lines here left over here right

411
00:14:01,350 --> 00:14:03,570
and then bottom and obviously in the

412
00:14:03,570 --> 00:14:05,220
inspector we can see an equivalent to

413
00:14:05,220 --> 00:14:08,700
view of what's left but there is another

414
00:14:08,700 --> 00:14:10,650
way to delete them and that's to use the

415
00:14:10,650 --> 00:14:12,090
circles in the inspectors having come

416
00:14:12,090 --> 00:14:14,250
over here let's go ahead and do that

417
00:14:14,250 --> 00:14:15,570
let's delete the right and the bottom

418
00:14:15,570 --> 00:14:17,160
one so I'm gonna come over here and just

419
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:19,740
click on that noticing how it turned

420
00:14:19,740 --> 00:14:22,080
into an excess I click on delete and do

421
00:14:22,080 --> 00:14:24,180
the right way and then to click on the X

422
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:27,090
there as well and that's now left only

423
00:14:27,090 --> 00:14:28,620
the left constraint that's the only one

424
00:14:28,620 --> 00:14:30,900
that's there now then I can go ahead if

425
00:14:30,900 --> 00:14:32,460
I want to and I can just hover over the

426
00:14:32,460 --> 00:14:34,770
left-hand constraint click on the button

427
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:37,920
to delete it and you can see we've now

428
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:39,570
got no constraints left for our images

429
00:14:39,570 --> 00:14:41,610
and we can also see there's no lines in

430
00:14:41,610 --> 00:14:43,650
the inspector showing that there are any

431
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:45,600
constraints so basically what this means

432
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:47,370
is that our image is now unconstrained

433
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,560
and that means there's nothing to keep

434
00:14:49,560 --> 00:14:52,230
it in place on the screen now it is sort

435
00:14:52,230 --> 00:14:54,450
of appearing in the center but and this

436
00:14:54,450 --> 00:14:56,220
is important that's only because it has

437
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,770
to appear somewhere so imagine that

438
00:14:58,770 --> 00:15:01,380
you're creating a collage by placing a

439
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,150
load of photographs maybe some magazine

440
00:15:03,150 --> 00:15:05,340
articles things like that onto a large

441
00:15:05,340 --> 00:15:07,320
piece of card you'll get everything

442
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:08,850
nicely positioned but you haven't used

443
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:11,160
any glue so as soon as you pick the card

444
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:13,620
up everything's going to fall off and

445
00:15:13,620 --> 00:15:15,030
that's because there's nothing holding

446
00:15:15,030 --> 00:15:18,210
all the photos and articles in place so

447
00:15:18,210 --> 00:15:19,350
thinking about layout without

448
00:15:19,350 --> 00:15:22,110
constraints as being just like that so

449
00:15:22,110 --> 00:15:23,400
we've got an image on the screen but

450
00:15:23,400 --> 00:15:25,560
there's no glue to fix that image in

451
00:15:25,560 --> 00:15:27,960
place so what constraints are well

452
00:15:27,960 --> 00:15:29,790
they're like glue because they fix the

453
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:32,730
widget in place without constraints to

454
00:15:32,730 --> 00:15:34,290
which it will effectively fall off the

455
00:15:34,290 --> 00:15:36,270
screen when you run the app now of

456
00:15:36,270 --> 00:15:37,590
course it will really fall off the

457
00:15:37,590 --> 00:15:39,990
screen it will be actually be positioned on

458
00:15:39,990 --> 00:15:41,459
screen in fact in the top left-hand

459
00:15:41,459 --> 00:15:43,470
corner of the screen but if you've got

460
00:15:43,470 --> 00:15:45,330
several unconstrained widgets they'll

461
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,790
all appear at the top left so you what

462
00:15:47,790 --> 00:15:49,110
you'll do is you'll get one on top of

463
00:15:49,110 --> 00:15:51,300
the other all right so we're going to

464
00:15:51,300 --> 00:15:53,250
finish the video in a moment but firstly

465
00:15:53,250 --> 00:15:54,899
notice on either the designer or the

466
00:15:54,899 --> 00:15:56,730
blueprint there's these little handles

467
00:15:56,730 --> 00:15:58,200
on each of the four corners of the image

468
00:15:58,200 --> 00:16:00,300
view these ones here and notice when I

469
00:16:00,300 --> 00:16:02,490
move my mouse there they actually change

470
00:16:02,490 --> 00:16:03,930
and day you can see if I hover over that

471
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,300
it says resize viewing and when I

472
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:08,399
actually click on into there the mouse

473
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:10,080
pointer changes to the normal resize

474
00:16:10,080 --> 00:16:11,459
pointer for whatever operating system

475
00:16:11,459 --> 00:16:13,770
you're running on so let's actually just

476
00:16:13,770 --> 00:16:15,020
get into here to the bottom and

477
00:16:15,020 --> 00:16:16,709
depending on what you can see on the

478
00:16:16,709 --> 00:16:18,180
screen there you might find that the

479
00:16:18,180 --> 00:16:19,980
entire image no longer fits the designer

480
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:21,000
because we've removed all the

481
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:23,640
constraints but just select one that you

482
00:16:23,640 --> 00:16:26,250
can what I'm going to do is select the

483
00:16:26,250 --> 00:16:27,660
bottom right one so they might take a

484
00:16:27,660 --> 00:16:29,490
little bit of fine-tuning to get to

485
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:31,200
exactly where you want I'm going to move

486
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:34,620
this and I'm just kind of drag it so

487
00:16:34,620 --> 00:16:36,089
occupies you know right about a quarter

488
00:16:36,089 --> 00:16:38,610
of the screen like so then release the

489
