00:00:05.390 --> 00:00:11.110

In this section we're going to look at how applications can store data in a database.



2

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:14.230

We're going to start off with a discussion of databases in general.



3

00:00:14.380 --> 00:00:20.310

Then we'll have a look at the database that's included with Android and that's is a lot that will load



4

00:00:20.310 --> 00:00:23.660

the Escudo language often pronounced Seacole.



5

00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:30.960

So it is well structured query language was designed for interrogating and updating relational databases.



6

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.630

Now it's a fairly simple language but it can allow very powerful queries to be created.



7

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:38.880

Now what you see in databases in an app.



8

00:00:39.060 --> 00:00:41.580

There are simple approaches that can be used.



9

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:45.780

Generally though you have to assume that database access will be quite slow.



10

00:00:46.140 --> 00:00:51.950

So Android provides low to classes that can be used to prevent yourself from appearing to hang wildcatters



11

00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.890

fetched from the database.



12

00:00:54.020 --> 00:00:59.810

So we'll also talk about curses and the Android content provider and content resolver classes.



13

00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.400

Now we will be creating a very basic app in this section just to see a couple of ways that we can access



14

00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:06.290

a database.



15

00:01:06.450 --> 00:01:11.400

You know Android apps Politis sections will build on this knowledge and we'll be creating an app to



16

00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:15.590

make full use of a database in the next section after this section of the course.



17

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:17.060

So let's get started.
