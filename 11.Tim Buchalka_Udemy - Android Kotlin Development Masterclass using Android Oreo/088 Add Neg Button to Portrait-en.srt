1
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:08,260
all right so apart from the to edit text

2
00:00:08,260 --> 00:00:10,000
widgets and the position of the

3
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,090
operation text view the portrait layouts

4
00:00:13,090 --> 00:00:15,699
tentacle to the landscape version as is

5
00:00:15,699 --> 00:00:17,230
often the case though there are several

6
00:00:17,230 --> 00:00:19,720
ways to achieve the same effect so let's

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:22,300
look at two different ways of adding

8
00:00:22,300 --> 00:00:25,859
this neck button to our portrait layout

9
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:28,240
now the first slide here is showing a

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:30,039
similar approach as in the landscape

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:32,470
layout the buttons in the second column

12
00:00:32,470 --> 00:00:35,170
that's 8 down to the dot are constrained

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:36,880
to the left of the button to their right

14
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,430
but it's the same otherwise the

15
00:00:39,430 --> 00:00:41,290
important thing is that all the buttons

16
00:00:41,290 --> 00:00:43,090
are constrained towards the key button

17
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:46,300
which in this example is button 9 now

18
00:00:46,300 --> 00:00:47,800
the buttons in the first two columns

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:49,270
have a constraint from their right edge

20
00:00:49,270 --> 00:00:51,100
to the button on their right and a

21
00:00:51,100 --> 00:00:53,410
baseline constraint also to the button

22
00:00:53,410 --> 00:00:55,480
on their right and the buttons in the

23
00:00:55,480 --> 00:00:57,670
last two columns go the other way so

24
00:00:57,670 --> 00:00:59,410
their left edge is constrained to the

25
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:01,390
buttons on their left and the baseline

26
00:01:01,390 --> 00:01:03,910
constraint is also to the left so that

27
00:01:03,910 --> 00:01:05,199
way all the columns are being

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,680
constrained towards the central column

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:09,880
now constraining the buttons like this

30
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:12,130
makes make sure that they're a fixed

31
00:01:12,130 --> 00:01:14,259
distance from their neighbor and aligned

32
00:01:14,259 --> 00:01:17,229
correctly within neighbors baseline now

33
00:01:17,229 --> 00:01:19,149
the overall horizontal and vertical

34
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:21,549
alignment is handled by constraints in

35
00:01:21,549 --> 00:01:24,039
the central column each button has a

36
00:01:24,039 --> 00:01:26,380
vertical constraint from its top edge to

37
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:28,479
the bottom of the button above which

38
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,069
takes care of the spacing between the

39
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:33,670
rows of buttons now to keep the columns

40
00:01:33,670 --> 00:01:34,810
in a straight line

41
00:01:34,810 --> 00:01:37,659
each button in the central column has

42
00:01:37,659 --> 00:01:39,729
its left edge lined up with their leaf

43
00:01:39,729 --> 00:01:41,920
with the left edge of the button above

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,770
it now one disadvantage of this approach

45
00:01:44,770 --> 00:01:47,259
is that you'd have to change 13 margins

46
00:01:47,259 --> 00:01:49,240
if you wanted to allow the space in

47
00:01:49,240 --> 00:01:50,619
between or if you wanted to auto rather

48
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:53,679
the spacing between the columns all the

49
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:55,209
constraints from the right edge of one

50
00:01:55,209 --> 00:01:57,130
button to the left edge of its neighbor

51
00:01:57,130 --> 00:01:59,799
would have to be changed and vice-versa

52
00:01:59,799 --> 00:02:01,779
for the buttons to the right of Center

53
00:02:01,779 --> 00:02:03,579
so let's look at a slightly different

54
00:02:03,579 --> 00:02:08,229
approach to this in the next slide now

55
00:02:08,229 --> 00:02:09,580
here the rows are still lined up

56
00:02:09,580 --> 00:02:11,800
vertically by their baseline constraints

57
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,319
and the row spacing set by vertical

58
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,140
constraints in the central column now

59
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,300
the columns are lined up by constraint

60
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:21,970
the edge of a button to the edge of the

61
00:02:21,970 --> 00:02:24,550
button above now I've used the left edge

62
00:02:24,550 --> 00:02:26,340
but the right edge would do just as well

63
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:28,450
because all the buttons are the same

64
00:02:28,450 --> 00:02:31,450
size now the column spacing is set by

65
00:02:31,450 --> 00:02:33,760
the horizontal constraints in the top

66
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:36,400
row now you'd only have to change the

67
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,950
margins on four constraints to alter the

68
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:41,260
column spacing in this scenario and

69
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,030
three constraints to alter the row

70
00:02:43,030 --> 00:02:46,000
spacing and as I mentioned there's

71
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:47,380
nearly always more than one way to do

72
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,760
things so it's worth looking at

73
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:50,770
alternatives to see if there's any

74
00:02:50,770 --> 00:02:53,230
advantage to be gained from choosing one

75
00:02:53,230 --> 00:02:55,450
way or the other in this video we're

76
00:02:55,450 --> 00:02:56,950
going to use that second approach or

77
00:02:56,950 --> 00:02:58,360
this second approach for the portrait

78
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:00,760
layout it's probably not a good idea to

79
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:02,350
do things differently in a landscape and

80
00:03:02,350 --> 00:03:05,110
portrait layout unless you have to so

81
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:06,550
I'm just doing it in this example just

82
00:03:06,550 --> 00:03:08,200
so you can see the different approaches

83
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:09,970
in your own app so you really want to

84
00:03:09,970 --> 00:03:12,990
try to be consistent wherever possible

85
00:03:12,990 --> 00:03:15,430
okay so I'm editing the portrait layout

86
00:03:15,430 --> 00:03:18,310
in activity underscore main dot XML and

87
00:03:18,310 --> 00:03:20,350
can obviously see up here in the tab its

88
00:03:20,350 --> 00:03:22,450
layout slash activity and as its germane

89
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,250
and it's not the land which was our

90
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:26,200
landscape one and obviously clearly we

91
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:28,060
can see that this is a portrait layout

92
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:30,430
anyway all right so the first thing we

93
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:32,140
need to do is clear all the constraints

94
00:03:32,140 --> 00:03:34,390
from the buttons there's only three

95
00:03:34,390 --> 00:03:36,820
widgets that out buttons so it could

96
00:03:36,820 --> 00:03:38,110
actually just make sense to use the

97
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:40,230
clear all constraints button and

98
00:03:40,230 --> 00:03:42,700
recreate the constraints on the Edit

99
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:43,720
views and the textview

100
00:03:43,720 --> 00:03:45,970
now if the layout was more complicated

101
00:03:45,970 --> 00:03:48,790
that could be a bit of a pain so there's

102
00:03:48,790 --> 00:03:50,650
another way that's not obvious but it's

103
00:03:50,650 --> 00:03:52,300
a bit quicker than selecting each button

104
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,670
in turn and clicking it's clearly

105
00:03:54,670 --> 00:03:57,280
constraints button so what you need to

106
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:59,590
do is draw a rectangle to enclose all

107
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:02,050
the buttons taking care to avoid the

108
00:04:02,050 --> 00:04:03,910
other three widgets so I want to come

109
00:04:03,910 --> 00:04:05,410
down here and click and I'm going to be

110
00:04:05,410 --> 00:04:08,320
very careful just to include the 16

111
00:04:08,320 --> 00:04:11,350
buttons so I haven't touched the

112
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,440
textview or either of the two edit texts

113
00:04:14,440 --> 00:04:15,640
and by the way you can confirm that

114
00:04:15,640 --> 00:04:18,459
looking in the component tree that both

115
00:04:18,459 --> 00:04:20,799
edit texts and the text views haven't

116
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:22,660
been selected here but all the other

117
00:04:22,660 --> 00:04:25,150
buttons have been selected and again

118
00:04:25,150 --> 00:04:26,290
remember when you're doing that you

119
00:04:26,290 --> 00:04:28,060
don't have to fully enclose a button to

120
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:30,640
select it another alternative to that

121
00:04:30,640 --> 00:04:32,090
one was that I can just

122
00:04:32,090 --> 00:04:34,040
click that or deselect that I can

123
00:04:34,040 --> 00:04:36,230
actually click on one button and like a

124
00:04:36,230 --> 00:04:38,470
right-click and click on select and

125
00:04:38,470 --> 00:04:41,750
select same top that will then select

126
00:04:41,750 --> 00:04:43,490
the rest of the buttons or in this case

127
00:04:43,490 --> 00:04:46,190
all the widgets on screen of the same

128
00:04:46,190 --> 00:04:49,040
type which is button in this case now

129
00:04:49,040 --> 00:04:52,370
once all the buttons are selected if we

130
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:54,410
hover over that we can see that the

131
00:04:54,410 --> 00:04:56,720
clear constraints button for each one

132
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:58,940
becomes visible as we move over it so we

133
00:04:58,940 --> 00:05:00,940
just need to carefully click each one I

134
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:02,840
just need to come over here just click

135
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:12,350
each one as we go through now if you go

136
00:05:12,350 --> 00:05:13,760
a bit fast you might find that the

137
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,770
buttons get unselected that's fine just

138
00:05:15,770 --> 00:05:17,450
take seconds to select them all again

139
00:05:17,450 --> 00:05:18,889
using either the methods that I've shown

140
00:05:18,889 --> 00:05:21,340
you so I'm going to continue through and

141
00:05:21,340 --> 00:05:23,419
clear the rest of the constraints for

142
00:05:23,419 --> 00:05:28,970
the buttons in the last for now alright

143
00:05:28,970 --> 00:05:30,410
so that's now their constraints cleared

144
00:05:30,410 --> 00:05:33,740
do I miss that one yes I did so you can

145
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:35,240
see now on the screen that looks to me

146
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:36,680
like we've actually no successfully

147
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:37,160
deleted

148
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:39,100
all the constraints from the buttons

149
00:05:39,100 --> 00:05:40,910
nothing I've done there I'm just going

150
00:05:40,910 --> 00:05:43,100
to click on a blank area and because

151
00:05:43,100 --> 00:05:44,690
we're in portrait what I'm going to do

152
00:05:44,690 --> 00:05:49,990
is just bring back the designer as well

153
00:05:49,990 --> 00:05:52,849
obviously with the landscape perversion

154
00:05:52,849 --> 00:05:53,930
when we're editing that it made more

155
00:05:53,930 --> 00:05:55,610
sense just to have the blueprint because

156
00:05:55,610 --> 00:05:57,200
we can fit both on there I like to see

157
00:05:57,200 --> 00:05:58,550
them both at once c'est possible

158
00:05:58,550 --> 00:06:00,440
although I still do my work in the

159
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:03,530
blueprint but just if you did why we

160
00:06:03,530 --> 00:06:04,970
have just the one another alternative is

161
00:06:04,970 --> 00:06:08,090
just to go back to the blueprint and you

162
00:06:08,090 --> 00:06:10,639
can then increase the size and get that

163
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,050
bigger obviously that's too big for my

164
00:06:12,050 --> 00:06:14,000
monitor now if you want to see it in a

165
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,070
larger size and in this case we've got

166
00:06:16,070 --> 00:06:17,810
enough screen real estate for both so

167
00:06:17,810 --> 00:06:18,950
I'm going to have both of them on the

168
00:06:18,950 --> 00:06:21,200
screen alright so I need another button

169
00:06:21,200 --> 00:06:23,810
and I could just drag one in from the

170
00:06:23,810 --> 00:06:25,789
palette and said it's all its size

171
00:06:25,789 --> 00:06:28,099
properties etc but again when you're

172
00:06:28,099 --> 00:06:29,539
working with a group of widgets that are

173
00:06:29,539 --> 00:06:32,120
all very similar it's often easier to

174
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:33,740
just copy and paste one of them s we've

175
00:06:33,740 --> 00:06:36,560
seen in previous videos so again going

176
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:38,750
to choose a divided button I'm just

177
00:06:38,750 --> 00:06:40,190
going to right click that and choose

178
00:06:40,190 --> 00:06:43,909
copy then I'm going to right-click on a

179
00:06:43,909 --> 00:06:45,860
blank area of the blue

180
00:06:45,860 --> 00:06:49,460
and she's pasted that's before you

181
00:06:49,460 --> 00:06:51,710
briefly saw another button animate and

182
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,990
appear over the top of the divide they

183
00:06:53,990 --> 00:06:55,610
want to make sure that it's selected in

184
00:06:55,610 --> 00:06:57,020
the component tree we've got this button

185
00:06:57,020 --> 00:06:58,189
divided too so I'm going to click on

186
00:06:58,189 --> 00:06:58,490
that

187
00:06:58,490 --> 00:07:00,650
so it's selected and we're going to

188
00:07:00,650 --> 00:07:02,180
change a few things we're going to call

189
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,210
it button neck like we called it in the

190
00:07:04,210 --> 00:07:07,789
landscape version the lens in landscape

191
00:07:07,789 --> 00:07:10,069
layout a button neck and we also have

192
00:07:10,069 --> 00:07:12,020
the text here we're going to change that

193
00:07:12,020 --> 00:07:16,669
and the text will say neg it's into

194
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,379
there and the other thing we're going to

195
00:07:18,379 --> 00:07:20,779
do if you recall we change the text

196
00:07:20,779 --> 00:07:22,370
properly or sorry the text size property

197
00:07:22,370 --> 00:07:24,529
to 12 SP so let's go ahead and do that

198
00:07:24,529 --> 00:07:28,580
as well 12 SP this start fits in a

199
00:07:28,580 --> 00:07:29,840
little bit nicer with the rest of the

200
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:33,349
buttons now the here the ID is very

201
00:07:33,349 --> 00:07:36,080
important it has to be the same ID that

202
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:37,759
we've given it in the landscape layout

203
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:39,680
and we just briefly go back to the

204
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:41,719
landscape layout and egg button

205
00:07:41,719 --> 00:07:46,370
we call it button neg back here button

206
00:07:46,370 --> 00:07:49,099
there in the portrait version and

207
00:07:49,099 --> 00:07:50,089
remember that our codes already

208
00:07:50,089 --> 00:07:51,819
referring to a by ID in any event

209
00:07:51,819 --> 00:07:53,930
alright so what we need next is a

210
00:07:53,930 --> 00:07:56,839
baseline constraint from each button in

211
00:07:56,839 --> 00:07:59,300
the two outer columns to the button on

212
00:07:59,300 --> 00:08:01,490
its right or left working in towards the

213
00:08:01,490 --> 00:08:02,529
central row

214
00:08:02,529 --> 00:08:04,490
so let's go ahead and do that so I'm

215
00:08:04,490 --> 00:08:06,979
going to start over here with the 7 I'm

216
00:08:06,979 --> 00:08:10,669
gonna set a baseline constraint and set

217
00:08:10,669 --> 00:08:15,680
that to 8 and 8 I'm going to set to 9 so

218
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:21,139
select 8 constraint it set that to 9 and

219
00:08:21,139 --> 00:08:22,520
the other thing I haven't done you know

220
00:08:22,520 --> 00:08:25,430
haven't moved the neg button so I'm

221
00:08:25,430 --> 00:08:26,629
gonna move that briefly so we can see a

222
00:08:26,629 --> 00:08:27,849
little bit there

223
00:08:27,849 --> 00:08:30,560
now with the neg button we want to set

224
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:34,039
the constraint to the left in this case

225
00:08:34,039 --> 00:08:35,539
I'm going to select that select the

226
00:08:35,539 --> 00:08:37,940
baseline constraint constrain it to the

227
00:08:37,940 --> 00:08:41,719
divide then the d'void button I'm going

228
00:08:41,719 --> 00:08:43,760
to set a constraint to that that's going

229
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:46,640
to be constrained to the 9 I'm going to

230
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:47,810
do the same no for the rest of the

231
00:08:47,810 --> 00:08:49,899
button so I'm going to do the for

232
00:08:49,899 --> 00:08:55,579
baseline constraint to the 5 the 5 based

233
00:08:55,579 --> 00:08:57,620
on constraint to the 6

234
00:08:57,620 --> 00:08:59,510
and then the asterisks we're going to a

235
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,770
baseline constraint to the six and it's

236
00:09:03,770 --> 00:09:05,080
going to continue right now with the one

237
00:09:05,080 --> 00:09:08,570
based on constraint to the - try that

238
00:09:08,570 --> 00:09:12,589
again and the - we're going to constrain

239
00:09:12,589 --> 00:09:14,990
to the baseline whoops I'll just undo

240
00:09:14,990 --> 00:09:17,720
that change based on constraint to the

241
00:09:17,720 --> 00:09:20,900
three and the minus sign based on

242
00:09:20,900 --> 00:09:25,370
constraint to the three and in the last

243
00:09:25,370 --> 00:09:27,680
line now based on constraint for the

244
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:32,570
zero to the dot and select the dot based

245
00:09:32,570 --> 00:09:35,779
on constraint to the equals and the plus

246
00:09:35,779 --> 00:09:37,670
we're going to do a baseline constraint

247
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:41,779
to the equals and then the neg I need to

248
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:46,250
do a baseline constraint to that I'll do

249
00:09:46,250 --> 00:09:48,170
that when I try to move it and then I'm

250
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:49,820
going to base local straight to the

251
00:09:49,820 --> 00:09:53,150
division / button alright so that's the

252
00:09:53,150 --> 00:09:55,730
first step done next on the top row only

253
00:09:55,730 --> 00:09:57,770
we need a right or left constraint on

254
00:09:57,770 --> 00:09:59,600
each button in the outer two columns

255
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
again working in towards the central

256
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:03,620
column they're all actually little bit

257
00:10:03,620 --> 00:10:05,839
close together at the moment so standing

258
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,880
at seven this is the top row only we

259
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:09,680
want that we need a right or left

260
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:11,480
constraint on each atom into the button

261
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:13,970
in the outer two columns again working

262
00:10:13,970 --> 00:10:16,130
in towards the central column so I'm

263
00:10:16,130 --> 00:10:20,560
going to add the constraint to the eight

264
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:22,760
and eight I'm going to add a constraint

265
00:10:22,760 --> 00:10:25,100
to the nine and the other sort of going

266
00:10:25,100 --> 00:10:27,260
to add the constraint for the neck to

267
00:10:27,260 --> 00:10:29,420
the divide and then click on the divide

268
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:32,720
constrain that to the nine and they are

269
00:10:32,720 --> 00:10:34,160
pretty close together so it's a good

270
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:35,930
idea to check the inspector as you're

271
00:10:35,930 --> 00:10:37,670
doing that just to make sure that they

272
00:10:37,670 --> 00:10:41,050
are constrained so we've got eight and

273
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:43,010
seven both constraint as you can see

274
00:10:43,010 --> 00:10:45,459
their neck is constrained as is the

275
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:48,709
divided you know known at the moment

276
00:10:48,709 --> 00:10:50,900
hasn't got any constraints we're going

277
00:10:50,900 --> 00:10:52,670
to know moving up working up from the

278
00:10:52,670 --> 00:10:55,730
equals button up down here each button

279
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,400
in that central column effectively needs

280
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:00,350
its top edge constrain to the bottom of

281
00:11:00,350 --> 00:11:02,000
the button above so I'm going to click

282
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,980
on that constrain the equals to the

283
00:11:03,980 --> 00:11:06,589
three I can see at the top there where

284
00:11:06,589 --> 00:11:08,870
they've added the constraint or not from

285
00:11:08,870 --> 00:11:10,520
the three I'm going to constrain to the

286
00:11:10,520 --> 00:11:11,530
six

287
00:11:11,530 --> 00:11:13,180
again I'm looking at the margins in the

288
00:11:13,180 --> 00:11:14,410
inspector to say that that is working

289
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:17,740
and from the six I'm going to constrain

290
00:11:17,740 --> 00:11:20,110
that to the nine and you can see that

291
00:11:20,110 --> 00:11:21,490
we've added the constraint at the top

292
00:11:21,490 --> 00:11:24,130
there for that as well now but no one

293
00:11:24,130 --> 00:11:25,930
will have its top edge constrained to

294
00:11:25,930 --> 00:11:28,330
the bottom of the new number in a text

295
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,540
widget and if you recall you never see

296
00:11:31,540 --> 00:11:33,730
second one so I'm gonna click on nine

297
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,000
and constrain that to the new number you

298
00:11:37,000 --> 00:11:38,140
can see we've got a constraint on there

299
00:11:38,140 --> 00:11:38,500
now

300
00:11:38,500 --> 00:11:41,440
all right so finally every button in the

301
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,570
bottom three rows needs to have its left

302
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:46,360
edge constrained to the left edge of the

303
00:11:46,360 --> 00:11:49,210
button above with a margin of zero and

304
00:11:49,210 --> 00:11:51,280
you can make that easy if you like by

305
00:11:51,280 --> 00:11:52,810
changing the default margins to zero

306
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:55,570
using the button on the toolbars and I'm

307
00:11:55,570 --> 00:11:58,810
going to go ahead and do that and change

308
00:11:58,810 --> 00:12:01,300
that to zero so again what we're doing

309
00:12:01,300 --> 00:12:03,370
is for every button in the bottom of

310
00:12:03,370 --> 00:12:05,230
three rows we want its left edge

311
00:12:05,230 --> 00:12:07,060
constrained to the left edge of the

312
00:12:07,060 --> 00:12:09,520
button above I'm going to start with

313
00:12:09,520 --> 00:12:13,870
four and strain that to the seven the

314
00:12:13,870 --> 00:12:15,460
one I'm going to constrain to the four

315
00:12:15,460 --> 00:12:20,430
and the zero constrain that to the one

316
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:22,390
and I'm going to do the same for the

317
00:12:22,390 --> 00:12:23,530
next row because if we were doing this

318
00:12:23,530 --> 00:12:26,980
for the bottom of three rows now or if

319
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:30,970
everything in those three rows to there

320
00:12:30,970 --> 00:12:35,440
the two and for the two we're going to

321
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,650
constrain that to the five the five I'm

322
00:12:38,650 --> 00:12:42,550
going to constrain to the eight the

323
00:12:42,550 --> 00:12:44,530
equals I'm going to constrain to the

324
00:12:44,530 --> 00:12:53,440
three a 3 to the 6 and 6 to the 9 and

325
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:55,000
then the plus we're going to constrain

326
00:12:55,000 --> 00:12:58,120
to the minors the - I'm going to

327
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:00,490
constrain to the multiplication one and

328
00:13:00,490 --> 00:13:02,290
the multiply multiply I'm going to

329
00:13:02,290 --> 00:13:06,550
constrain to the divide and I'm not sure

330
00:13:06,550 --> 00:13:07,930
whether I did the bynars there did I

331
00:13:07,930 --> 00:13:10,810
yes that's constrained and again when in

332
00:13:10,810 --> 00:13:13,510
doubt you can click on any control and

333
00:13:13,510 --> 00:13:15,100
just check that we've actually got a

334
00:13:15,100 --> 00:13:18,339
margin there and that it has been

335
00:13:18,339 --> 00:13:21,420
constrained

336
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:24,670
you

337
00:13:24,670 --> 00:13:27,490
okay now I know that I deleted all the

338
00:13:27,490 --> 00:13:29,170
baseline and edge constraints just to

339
00:13:29,170 --> 00:13:31,360
recreate some of them again but it's

340
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:33,580
often safer to work with a clear slate

341
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:35,890
when you're making significant changes

342
00:13:35,890 --> 00:13:37,210
to constraints like we were here

343
00:13:37,210 --> 00:13:39,460
deleting just aside constraints for each

344
00:13:39,460 --> 00:13:40,930
button individually would have been very

345
00:13:40,930 --> 00:13:43,120
fiddly as well and a good way to make a

346
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,330
mistake so the layout now should match

347
00:13:46,330 --> 00:13:47,860
that second slide which I'll just put on

348
00:13:47,860 --> 00:13:50,530
the screen briefly and I can test that

349
00:13:50,530 --> 00:13:52,150
now now we're back in Android studio by

350
00:13:52,150 --> 00:13:53,860
dragging the button 9 around let's go

351
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,620
ahead and do that and you can see when

352
00:13:56,620 --> 00:13:58,030
I'm moving button line around everything

353
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:00,070
is actually moving correctly so

354
00:14:00,070 --> 00:14:01,060
basically all the other buttons are

355
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:03,160
following it if any don't follow it's

356
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:04,780
very easy to spot and fix up their

357
00:14:04,780 --> 00:14:06,550
constraint because you'll know the

358
00:14:06,550 --> 00:14:07,930
button that's not moving that needs to

359
00:14:07,930 --> 00:14:10,180
be actually adjusted you know I didn't

360
00:14:10,180 --> 00:14:11,650
actually increase all the margins when

361
00:14:11,650 --> 00:14:14,020
producing the slide so it was easier to

362
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:16,090
see the constraints clearly but apart

363
00:14:16,090 --> 00:14:18,070
from the spacing our layout should match

364
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:20,350
that slide if any buttons look out of

365
00:14:20,350 --> 00:14:22,030
line then check the top and left or

366
00:14:22,030 --> 00:14:23,440
right constraint margins that's

367
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:25,990
appropriate alright the final step now

368
00:14:25,990 --> 00:14:28,020
is to center button 9 in the layout

369
00:14:28,020 --> 00:14:29,610
we're going to do that by creating

370
00:14:29,610 --> 00:14:31,450
constraints from its left and right

371
00:14:31,450 --> 00:14:33,370
edges to the edges of the layout and

372
00:14:33,370 --> 00:14:35,290
then making sure that it's a horizontal

373
00:14:35,290 --> 00:14:38,380
slider is set to 50% so I'm going to

374
00:14:38,380 --> 00:14:40,380
start by doing that so I've got the 9

375
00:14:40,380 --> 00:14:43,840
constrain that to the left first and you

376
00:14:43,840 --> 00:14:45,040
can see that it's all moved off screen

377
00:14:45,040 --> 00:14:46,300
but that's fine we're gonna click on 9

378
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:48,600
again and constrain the right hand side

379
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:51,280
that brings it all back nicely and we

380
00:14:51,280 --> 00:14:52,210
just want to make sure that the

381
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:54,010
horizontal slider up here in the

382
00:14:54,010 --> 00:14:56,830
inspector is set to 50 which it is in

383
00:14:56,830 --> 00:15:00,580
this case now button is top constraint

384
00:15:00,580 --> 00:15:02,440
margin should be 8 DP at the moment is

385
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,600
much larger at set to 20 so let's change

386
00:15:04,600 --> 00:15:07,240
that to 8 DP so it's closer to the edit

387
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:09,910
text and as you saw me do it there it's

388
00:15:09,910 --> 00:15:11,440
a lot easier to do that in the inspector

389
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:12,760
rather than trying to drag it into

390
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:14,860
position all right now that we've done

391
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,450
that I'm gonna drag the button neg in

392
00:15:16,450 --> 00:15:18,820
the component tree so that it's just

393
00:15:18,820 --> 00:15:21,910
below the button divided as I did for

394
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:25,150
landscape our version of this layout and

395
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,280
now I'm just going to reformat the XML

396
00:15:29,280 --> 00:15:33,340
code we format code the lines needed to

397
00:15:33,340 --> 00:15:35,530
be changed there and importantly let's

398
00:15:35,530 --> 00:15:37,390
now run the app to make sure it works in

399
00:15:37,390 --> 00:15:38,350
both portrait and landscape

400
00:15:38,350 --> 00:15:41,890
okay bearing in mind that last time when

401
00:15:41,890 --> 00:15:43,150
we went into portrait mode we had a

402
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:47,140
crash and now it's working nice as you

403
00:15:47,140 --> 00:15:48,520
can see so I should be able to press an

404
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:53,050
egg button 55 equals that's working

405
00:15:53,050 --> 00:15:54,520
nicely and I should be able to go to a

406
00:15:54,520 --> 00:15:58,050
landscape mode again and put an egg

407
00:15:58,050 --> 00:16:03,000
twelve times and that's working nicely

408
00:16:03,000 --> 00:16:05,470
now if he up happened to crash in

409
00:16:05,470 --> 00:16:07,420
portrait mode when you tapped an egg

410
00:16:07,420 --> 00:16:09,700
button use the option back here in

411
00:16:09,700 --> 00:16:12,370
Android studio and a build to rebuild

412
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,000
project and that's because instant run

413
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:17,640
tries to update the app on the device

414
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:19,900
rather than installing it from scratch

415
00:16:19,900 --> 00:16:21,250
and it can sometimes run into

416
00:16:21,250 --> 00:16:23,230
difficulties and cause problems but

417
00:16:23,230 --> 00:16:25,780
rebuilding the project will fix that and

418
00:16:25,780 --> 00:16:28,120
in my testing I did find it fail to

419
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:29,680
update the portrait layout correctly on

420
00:16:29,680 --> 00:16:31,750
Windows sometimes but rebuilding the

421
00:16:31,750 --> 00:16:34,780
project solved that problem all right so

422
00:16:34,780 --> 00:16:36,160
let's see actually the end of the

423
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,440
calculator app and this section for now

424
00:16:38,440 --> 00:16:40,510
anyway I want to show you how to use the

425
00:16:40,510 --> 00:16:42,640
change in the constraint layout and a

426
00:16:42,640 --> 00:16:44,740
grid and our grid of buttons is a great

427
00:16:44,740 --> 00:16:46,450
way to demonstrate that so I'm going to

428
00:16:46,450 --> 00:16:47,950
be coming back to this app a little bit

429
00:16:47,950 --> 00:16:50,320
later but in this section we covered

430
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,940
layouts and the layout designer in

431
00:16:51,940 --> 00:16:54,190
greater detail as well as looking at

432
00:16:54,190 --> 00:16:55,990
ways to constraint groups of widgets

433
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,000
together and to position the group in

434
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:00,100
the layout and then we also looked at

435
00:17:00,100 --> 00:17:01,750
the guidelines that are available in the

436
00:17:01,750 --> 00:17:04,660
constraint layout we created code to

437
00:17:04,660 --> 00:17:06,430
respond to button clicks and use the

438
00:17:06,430 --> 00:17:08,110
same listener for groups of buttons

439
00:17:08,110 --> 00:17:10,240
which is generally more efficient when

440
00:17:10,240 --> 00:17:12,670
the buttons performs similar tasks we

441
00:17:12,670 --> 00:17:14,290
also saw how to create different lanced

442
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:16,270
layouts for both portrait and landscape

443
00:17:16,270 --> 00:17:18,850
modes to handle situations where widgets

444
00:17:18,850 --> 00:17:20,920
just wouldn't fit comfortably in both

445
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,830
orientations and I also showed you a

446
00:17:23,830 --> 00:17:25,750
technique for testing a layout with your

447
00:17:25,750 --> 00:17:27,910
code before creating all the layouts

448
00:17:27,910 --> 00:17:29,830
that are required that way you can be

449
00:17:29,830 --> 00:17:30,850
sure that you're on the right track

450
00:17:30,850 --> 00:17:33,100
before investing a lot of time creating

451
00:17:33,100 --> 00:17:36,280
multiple layouts all right I've got some

452
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:38,350
homework now to finish off this section

453
00:17:38,350 --> 00:17:39,970
and to do that we need the calculator

454
00:17:39,970 --> 00:17:42,180
runs I'm just going to run that again

455
00:17:42,180 --> 00:17:45,370
and we'll hover over to it so a strange

456
00:17:45,370 --> 00:17:47,020
quirk of the calculator is that you have

457
00:17:47,020 --> 00:17:49,030
to use the equals button to clear

458
00:17:49,030 --> 00:17:50,980
everything off in order to start a

459
00:17:50,980 --> 00:17:52,210
completely new calculation

460
00:17:52,210 --> 00:17:55,390
for example if I type in six divided by

461
00:17:55,390 --> 00:18:01,899
two minus three three equals zero but if

462
00:18:01,899 --> 00:18:04,480
now I want to multiply 9 by five I enter

463
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,409
nine multiplied but because that tries

464
00:18:08,409 --> 00:18:10,390
to multiply zero by nine it doesn't work

465
00:18:10,390 --> 00:18:13,029
so what I actually have to do is type

466
00:18:13,029 --> 00:18:17,200
equals or press equals nine equals

467
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:21,940
star five and now I get the answer 45

468
00:18:21,940 --> 00:18:24,270
when I press the next operator button

469
00:18:24,270 --> 00:18:26,500
that's not very intuitive and it might

470
00:18:26,500 --> 00:18:27,970
be better to have some sort of Clear

471
00:18:27,970 --> 00:18:29,950
button to clear the result and start

472
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:32,380
again so as an exercise your homework is

473
00:18:32,380 --> 00:18:34,570
to add a Clear button to the calculator

474
00:18:34,570 --> 00:18:36,010
you know I'm not going to be going

475
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:37,360
through that solution to that in a video

476
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,480
the real test that you've got here is

477
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:41,679
does it work when you try to implement

478
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:45,220
your solution alright so moving on in

479
00:18:45,220 --> 00:18:46,480
the next section we're going to start

480
00:18:46,480 --> 00:18:48,760
looking at downloading xml data from the

481
00:18:48,760 --> 00:18:51,220
internet and parsing it to display the

482
00:18:51,220 --> 00:18:53,169
information and we're also going to look

483
00:18:53,169 --> 00:18:55,390
at performing slow operations such as

484
00:18:55,390 --> 00:18:57,700
downloading on a separate thread so the

485
00:18:57,700 --> 00:18:59,799
app remains responsive even if it's busy

486
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:01,990
downloading so let's move on now to the

487
00:19:01,990 --> 00:19:04,440
next section
