00:00:04.690 --> 00:00:06.400

Alright so let's go through the



2

00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:08.770

solution to the problem that we talked



3

00:00:08.770 --> 00:00:11.040

about at the end of the last video.



4

00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.900

So the widgets grown as much as that needed



5

00:00:13.900 --> 00:00:16.000

and that's because there's no constraint



6

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.460

to prevent it from doing so and because



7

00:00:18.460 --> 00:00:21.070

also it's set to wrap content now if we



8

00:00:21.070 --> 00:00:22.270

didn't have the buttons on the screen



9

00:00:22.270 --> 00:00:24.580

that would probably be okay because we



10

00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:26.650

could make it scrollable but we really



11

00:00:26.650 --> 00:00:28.300

don't want it going behind the buttons



12

00:00:28.300 --> 00:00:30.910

as it's doing right now so to fix it we



13

00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:33.460

need to constrain its bottom edge now



14

00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:35.770

ideally I'd have done that first and



15

00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:37.719

that's because now I can't constrain the



16

00:00:37.719 --> 00:00:40.149

bottom edge to the buttons the edit text



17

00:00:40.149 --> 00:00:42.609

widgets in the way now sometimes



18

00:00:42.609 --> 00:00:44.289

possible if the bottom constraint



19

00:00:44.289 --> 00:00:46.329

handles visible but even then it's very



20

00:00:46.329 --> 00:00:49.179

fiddly so it's generally a good idea to



21

00:00:49.179 --> 00:00:52.120

set constraints before adding content it



22

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:54.129

may be possible to resize it by dragging



23

00:00:54.129 --> 00:00:56.859

the resize handles up the screen but



24

00:00:56.859 --> 00:00:58.719

sometimes the resize handle isn't



25

00:00:58.719 --> 00:01:00.729

available either they're off the bottom



26

00:01:00.729 --> 00:01:03.370

of the screen so what I suggest you do



27

00:01:03.370 --> 00:01:06.159

here is to delete the text set the



28

00:01:06.159 --> 00:01:08.650

constraint then paste the text back in



29

00:01:08.650 --> 00:01:11.020

and that would ordinarily be the easiest



30

00:01:11.020 --> 00:01:13.840

way to sort this out however it doesn't



31

00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:15.730

let me demonstrate how much constraint



32

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:17.860

works quite as effectively as what I'm



33

00:01:17.860 --> 00:01:19.810

going to do so in other words I'm not



34

00:01:19.810 --> 00:01:21.790

going to do it the easy way what I'm



35

00:01:21.790 --> 00:01:23.050

going to do instead is change the



36

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:25.780

vertical sizing to fixed so making sure



37

00:01:25.780 --> 00:01:28.720

the edit text is selected I'm going to



38

00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:30.370

click on these vertical lines until the



39

00:01:30.370 --> 00:01:32.020

straight lines appear on the inner lines



40

00:01:32.020 --> 00:01:34.300

I should say to the vertical lines



41

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.220

appear when two straight lines appear



42

00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:39.550

which is fixed and if it doesn't shrink



43

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:41.530

enough which it hasn't in my case you



44

00:01:41.530 --> 00:01:43.840

need to also change the layer width so



45

00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:47.080

if we change the layout height to 200 DP



46

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.600

that should be enough for us to do what



47

00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:52.720

we need to do and press Enter and you



48

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.340

can see now that ty we've got some space



49

00:01:54.340 --> 00:01:56.260

between the bottom of the edit text and



50

00:01:56.260 --> 00:01:59.080

the buttons in other words the bottom



51

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:01.270

constraint handles now visible all right



52

00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:03.490

so at this point we can set the bottom



53

00:02:03.490 --> 00:02:05.590

constraint of the edit text to the top



54

00:02:05.590 --> 00:02:07.810

of the buttons now it doesn't really



55

00:02:07.810 --> 00:02:09.879

matter which button we choose but it



56

00:02:09.879 --> 00:02:11.769

sort of seems logical to use the cancel



57

00:02:11.769 --> 00:02:14.260

button now the ok buttons already



58

00:02:14.260 --> 00:02:16.630

constrained to cancel so that sort of



59

00:02:16.630 --> 00:02:18.250

makes the cancel button as



60

00:02:18.250 --> 00:02:20.380

sort of key widget so for that reason



61

00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.090

I'm going to constrain the bottom of the



62

00:02:22.090 --> 00:02:24.160

edit text widget to the top of the



63

00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.770

cancel button now remember that you have



64

00:02:26.770 --> 00:02:29.230

to drag to the constraint handle on the



65

00:02:29.230 --> 00:02:31.810

destination widget in previous versions



66

00:02:31.810 --> 00:02:33.430

of Android studio you could just drag to



67

00:02:33.430 --> 00:02:35.440

a point anywhere along the edge but



68

00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:37.270

that's no longer the case so I'm just



69

00:02:37.270 --> 00:02:38.530

going to drag from the bottom of the



70

00:02:38.530 --> 00:02:41.770

edit text drag over to the top of the



71

00:02:41.770 --> 00:02:44.080

cancel button and you can see that our



72

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:47.680

edit text is now moved now that I've



73

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:49.360

done that it's easy to see why I had a



74

00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:51.250

problem why I had problems a minute ago



75

00:02:51.250 --> 00:02:53.620

I set the height of the edit text widget



76

00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:55.780

to wrap content and as soon as I set it



77

00:02:55.780 --> 00:02:58.650

back to wrap annals core content again



78

00:02:58.650 --> 00:03:01.510

we end up having the same problem and



79

00:03:01.510 --> 00:03:03.190

that's because the widget now grows down



80

00:03:03.190 --> 00:03:05.830

past the buttons again now I've



81

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.330

mentioned earlier in this section that



82

00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:09.730

the match constraints setting was like



83

00:03:09.730 --> 00:03:12.280

match parent but that it's different



84

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.100

because it respects constraints now as



85

00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:16.570

you can see with what I've done wrap



86

00:03:16.570 --> 00:03:19.170

content that doesn't respect constraints



87

00:03:19.170 --> 00:03:21.730

what we really want here is match



88

00:03:21.730 --> 00:03:24.190

constraint instead now I'm going to



89

00:03:24.190 --> 00:03:25.780

click on the vertical in Alliance twice



90

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:27.489

to set the height to match constraint



91

00:03:27.489 --> 00:03:29.560

rock or easily it just as easily have



92

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:30.790

come here and selected to match



93

00:03:30.790 --> 00:03:31.959

constraint I'm going to do that



94

00:03:31.959 --> 00:03:34.750

particular twice from fix and then back



95

00:03:34.750 --> 00:03:37.000

to match constraint and notice that what



96

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.640

I've done that we've now got some space



97

00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:42.730

between the bottom of our widget and the



98

00:03:42.730 --> 00:03:45.160

top of the buttons now I also want to



99

00:03:45.160 --> 00:03:47.079

make sure now that the width itself is



100

00:03:47.079 --> 00:03:48.670

set to match constraint as well so I'm



101

00:03:48.670 --> 00:03:50.910

going to go ahead and do that here



102

00:03:50.910 --> 00:03:53.140

because that's what we want here in



103

00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:55.360

landscape mode the edit text can get



104

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.360

wider rather than being a fixed width so



105

00:03:58.360 --> 00:04:00.190

yes you can see here that the match



106

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.920

constraint has fixed this problem now if



107

00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.079

you hadn't already guessed I used wrap



108

00:04:05.079 --> 00:04:06.280

and I've called content pair



109

00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:08.650

deliberately so if you're used to the



110

00:04:08.650 --> 00:04:10.989

earlier layouts in Android then you'll



111

00:04:10.989 --> 00:04:13.030

automatically set rep underscore content



112

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:15.310

out of habit is a very descriptive name



113

00:04:15.310 --> 00:04:17.530

for what it does and frankly old habits



114

00:04:17.530 --> 00:04:18.479

die hard



115

00:04:18.479 --> 00:04:20.650

all right so it's coming along nicely



116

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:22.750

and it's taken far longer to explain



117

00:04:22.750 --> 00:04:25.390

than it would take to do it but



118

00:04:25.390 --> 00:04:27.010

hopefully it all makes sense and you can



119

00:04:27.010 --> 00:04:29.740

see how the constraints work as long as



120

00:04:29.740 --> 00:04:31.849

you're patient and wait a second for the handles



121

00:04:31.849 --> 00:04:34.159

flesh dragging the constraints where you



122

00:04:34.159 --> 00:04:38.270

want them is quite easy all right so



123

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.740

I've tried to show all the constraints



124

00:04:39.740 --> 00:04:42.080

on this next slide so that you can pause



125

00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:43.879

the video and check that you have



126

00:04:43.879 --> 00:04:46.399

something similar now on the left of



127

00:04:46.399 --> 00:04:48.619

screenshots of the inspector paint for



128

00:04:48.619 --> 00:04:50.779

the four widgets and on the right is how



129

00:04:50.779 --> 00:04:52.399

the designer should appear with all the



130

00:04:52.399 --> 00:04:55.129

constraints showing now your widgets may



131

00:04:55.129 --> 00:04:57.499

have different IDs on these screens my



132

00:04:57.499 --> 00:04:59.240

buttons are called button two and button



133

00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:01.219

three but the numbers are assigned



134

00:05:01.219 --> 00:05:03.649

automatically now if you've added and



135

00:05:03.649 --> 00:05:06.080

deleted widgets then the IDS may differ



136

00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:07.939

slightly everything else should look the



137

00:05:07.939 --> 00:05:10.249

same though know if you're getting



138

00:05:10.249 --> 00:05:12.169

problems changing the value of any of



139

00:05:12.169 --> 00:05:14.779

the margins ignore that for now just



140

00:05:14.779 --> 00:05:16.399

leave the margin to whatever it's said



141

00:05:16.399 --> 00:05:19.249

to I'm going to be discussing a bug that



142

00:05:19.249 --> 00:05:21.529

sometimes causes that problem and show



143

00:05:21.529 --> 00:05:24.439

you what to do about it all right so



144

00:05:24.439 --> 00:05:26.449

we've still got the image to add but



145

00:05:26.449 --> 00:05:27.949

what I'm going to do is finish the video



146

00:05:27.949 --> 00:05:30.409

here and in the next video we'll add



147

00:05:30.409 --> 00:05:32.509

that image but prior to that or run the



148

00:05:32.509 --> 00:05:34.879

program just to see how it behaves so



149

00:05:34.879 --> 00:05:37.869

I'll see you in the next video.
