00:00:05.440 --> 00:00:08.360

In this section we're going to create another app.



2

00:00:08.380 --> 00:00:13.810

This one is a Flickr browser, which will allow us to query and download a list of recent photos from



3

00:00:13.810 --> 00:00:16.480

the hugely popular Flickr Web site.



4

00:00:16.840 --> 00:00:20.590

And it's also going to be our first taste of material design.



5

00:00:20.590 --> 00:00:24.570

Now google introduced material design in Android 5 lollipop,



6

00:00:24.820 --> 00:00:31.570

that's API 21, to encourage good design and allow a consistent user experience across different platforms



7

00:00:31.660 --> 00:00:33.340

and device sizes.



8

00:00:34.090 --> 00:00:39.280

And as you can see here on their website they've got a pretty good comprehensive description of material



9

00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:42.840

design, and the link to this is in the resources section.



10

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:48.910

So specifically in this section we're going to cover the following topics: Material Design, Compatibility



11

00:00:48.970 --> 00:00:53.770

with previous Android versions, Downloading JSON data from the web.



12

00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:58.690

Now we've seen how to download and process xml in the top 10 downloader, but this time we're going to use



13

00:00:58.690 --> 00:01:04.160

an async task to get JSON data rather than XML, and Async task,



14

00:01:04.160 --> 00:01:10.190

we're going to be using callback functions and interfaces. We're going look at the RecyclerView and Recycler



15

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:11.560

ViewAdapter.



16

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:14.480

Now the RecyclerView is the younger brother of the ListView,



17

00:01:14.710 --> 00:01:19.930

and really it's worth switching to the RecyclerView instead of a ListView when you want to display a list of



18

00:01:19.930 --> 00:01:21.560

scrolling items.



19

00:01:21.690 --> 00:01:27.340

We're going to be figuring out how to listen for taps on a RecyclerView and what the purpose of a Gesture



20

00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:28.370

Detector is.



21

00:01:28.410 --> 00:01:33.310

We're going to look at themes and styles and look at how they work for different versions of Android,



22

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:38.320

and our app will also allow us to search for different types of photos from Flickr.



23

00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:43.450

And to do that we need to have a look at SearchView, which is a component of Android so that you can



24

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:46.410

include the ability to search for things in your own apps.



25

00:01:47.720 --> 00:01:51.760

Alright so here we are with the app that we're going to be creating in this section of the course running.



26

00:01:52.190 --> 00:01:57.560

And we've actually got a RecylcerView showing the 20 photos from the Flickr feed



27

00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.720

Now I can scroll through this list and when I do that,



28

00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:03.410

notice the thumbnail is getting populated.



29

00:02:03.650 --> 00:02:08.210

There's a placeholder image there and that's getting populated as I scroll down. Now depending on your internet



30

00:02:08.210 --> 00:02:13.220

connection speed you might not see the placeholder images that briefly appear, before the thumbnails get



31

00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:14.220

downloaded.



32

00:02:14.270 --> 00:02:19.290

Now if we tap on of these entries we get a Toast message playing on the screen.



33

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:22.760

It just shows us the position number within the RecyclerView.



34

00:02:23.090 --> 00:02:27.170

Now that's not really functionality we'd leave in the app, but we'd done it to show you how you can



35

00:02:27.170 --> 00:02:32.290

respond to normal taps and long taps, because when I hold down and do a longer tap,



36

00:02:32.660 --> 00:02:37.910

you can see that we get another screen opening, and we get a full representation of that image as well as



37

00:02:37.910 --> 00:02:40.090

some additional data relating to that.



38

00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:45.230

So basically the full image is downloaded. Now it's possible to scale the image to fit completely



39

00:02:45.230 --> 00:02:46.010

on the screen.



40

00:02:46.220 --> 00:02:48.480

And we saw how to do that in section 5.



41

00:02:48.770 --> 00:02:52.280

But for this app I've made the images scrollable instead.



42

00:02:52.610 --> 00:02:57.620

So if an image is too high on the screen we can just scroll it, and that also allows the tags and the



43

00:02:57.620 --> 00:02:59.710

title to appear as well.



44

00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:05.420

Now the back button that will take us back to the list. back to the full list of the various trucks



45

00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:09.170

in this case that I searched for, and from there we can search for different photos as well.



46

00:03:09.220 --> 00:03:14.660

Now I tap the search icon on the toolbar up here, that launches the search activity that we'll be



47

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:19.480

creating and from there I can actually enter different search terms to bring up different photos



48

00:03:19.490 --> 00:03:20.400

relating to that.



49

00:03:20.570 --> 00:03:25.250

So for example I can type water, press enter,



50

00:03:25.790 --> 00:03:27.800

and that brings up a different set of images,



51

00:03:27.970 --> 00:03:32.130

and you can see that throws in some good photos again. We can do the same process as scrolling down, we can do a



52

00:03:32.150 --> 00:03:34.060

long tap to find that



53

00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:35.930

the full image downloaded,



54

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:38.750

and see what that looks like on the device.



55

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:44.140

Alright so that's our basic app. It uses a RecyclerView to display the initial list, and lets us



56

00:03:44.150 --> 00:03:48.670

launch different activities to display the full photos and perform a search.



57

00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.550

So we're going to start off by focusing on the downloading and processing of the data from the Flickr



58

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:57.580

feed, and you actually understand what the Flickr feed is as well as we make progress through this



59

00:03:57.590 --> 00:04:02.600

section of the course. When that's working we then add user interface to display the thumbnails and



60

00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:03.820

the full photographs.



61

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:05.550

So let's get started.
