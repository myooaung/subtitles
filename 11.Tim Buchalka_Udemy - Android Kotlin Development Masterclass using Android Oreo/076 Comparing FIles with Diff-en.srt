1
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:07,880
in the previous videos we created the

2
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:09,650
lay up for the calculator app and we saw

3
00:00:09,650 --> 00:00:11,840
it running on an emulator now it looks

4
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:13,790
fine on my screen when I run it but if

5
00:00:13,790 --> 00:00:14,960
you're having problems you might be

6
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:16,880
struggling to work out exactly what's

7
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:17,480
wrong

8
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:19,550
if you missed a step while we were

9
00:00:19,550 --> 00:00:21,410
creating the layout it can be difficult

10
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:24,020
to tell from the screen what bit may be

11
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:26,300
missing and if it's a whole widget then

12
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:28,220
you probably spun it quite easily but

13
00:00:28,220 --> 00:00:29,840
trying to work out all the constraints

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:31,849
by comparing the image on my screen if

15
00:00:31,849 --> 00:00:34,090
yours isn't very easy and intuitive

16
00:00:34,090 --> 00:00:36,170
there is a better way and that's to

17
00:00:36,170 --> 00:00:38,989
compare the XML files produced for the

18
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:41,750
layout now Android studio has a built in

19
00:00:41,750 --> 00:00:44,570
diff tool and that's a tool that allows

20
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,120
you to compare files with the computer

21
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,649
doing most of the work

22
00:00:48,649 --> 00:00:51,019
now these tend to work best when the

23
00:00:51,019 --> 00:00:52,969
contents of the files you're comparing

24
00:00:52,969 --> 00:00:55,789
are in roughly the right order so after

25
00:00:55,789 --> 00:00:57,260
completing layouts in the course make

26
00:00:57,260 --> 00:00:59,600
sure the order of your widgets in the

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:01,969
component tree matches mine and you can

28
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:04,400
see that on the screen there now it

29
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,440
didn't add another couple of widgets to

30
00:01:06,440 --> 00:01:07,790
the top of the layout since our last

31
00:01:07,790 --> 00:01:10,790
reorder the component tree so check the

32
00:01:10,790 --> 00:01:11,930
order of the tree and move them back

33
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:14,540
near the top if necessary and you can

34
00:01:14,540 --> 00:01:16,700
see we've got the result operation new

35
00:01:16,700 --> 00:01:18,920
number the buttons 0 through 9

36
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,590
then we've got divide multiply minus

37
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:25,430
plus dot and the equals buttons now it's

38
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:27,380
also a good idea to reformat your code

39
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,170
this applies whether it's XML or program

40
00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:33,020
code that you want to compare formatting

41
00:01:33,020 --> 00:01:35,240
the code in a standard way makes it much

42
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:37,969
easier to use differencing tools to spot

43
00:01:37,969 --> 00:01:41,060
differences so to do that and I did show

44
00:01:41,060 --> 00:01:42,890
you this in the last video but click on

45
00:01:42,890 --> 00:01:45,649
text and come up here to code to the

46
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,020
code menu and select reformat code

47
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:50,869
that's how you'd go about actually doing

48
00:01:50,869 --> 00:01:52,130
it but you can see I've got a little pop

49
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,380
up here saying my code or content rather

50
00:01:54,380 --> 00:01:57,680
is already properly formatted all right

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:58,969
so I've already got a copy of this

52
00:01:58,969 --> 00:02:01,579
layout file on my computer and we're

53
00:02:01,579 --> 00:02:02,689
going to do I want to close down the

54
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:04,070
landscape while I'm gonna be dealing

55
00:02:04,070 --> 00:02:06,740
with the portrait so we're going to be

56
00:02:06,740 --> 00:02:08,960
testing and comparing that one so I've

57
00:02:08,960 --> 00:02:11,380
really got a copy like I said

58
00:02:11,380 --> 00:02:13,840
so to start the comparison tool you want

59
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,990
to expand the project pane and follow

60
00:02:16,990 --> 00:02:19,060
the file that you want to check so I'm

61
00:02:19,060 --> 00:02:20,980
using the portrait activity underscore

62
00:02:20,980 --> 00:02:23,440
main dot XML subset so I can come down

63
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,230
here and open up the layout and here the

64
00:02:26,230 --> 00:02:28,060
activity underscore main dot XML is the

65
00:02:28,060 --> 00:02:30,370
one we want then will it select the file

66
00:02:30,370 --> 00:02:33,100
in the project pane you can actually see

67
00:02:33,100 --> 00:02:35,290
the path up here displayed just above

68
00:02:35,290 --> 00:02:37,660
the pain so within the calculator

69
00:02:37,660 --> 00:02:39,910
project this activity underscore main

70
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,050
dot XML can be found in app source main

71
00:02:44,050 --> 00:02:47,380
res layout that's the folder and

72
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:48,490
obviously the name is activity

73
00:02:48,490 --> 00:02:51,190
underscore main dot XML now you'll need

74
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,050
to know that path within the project

75
00:02:53,050 --> 00:02:54,970
when you come to compare files and

76
00:02:54,970 --> 00:02:56,800
different projects such as your copy

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,050
with the file with the files in my

78
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:01,390
source code for now though I'm going to

79
00:03:01,390 --> 00:03:03,250
compare this layout with another copy

80
00:03:03,250 --> 00:03:05,050
that I've already stored or this

81
00:03:05,050 --> 00:03:07,510
computer's hard drive so with a select

82
00:03:07,510 --> 00:03:09,340
activity del XML in the project pane

83
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:11,980
over here which is selected and I'm

84
00:03:11,980 --> 00:03:13,660
going to then come up to the View menu

85
00:03:13,660 --> 00:03:19,960
and click on compare with I want to do

86
00:03:19,960 --> 00:03:22,600
that I get a pop-up appear and by the

87
00:03:22,600 --> 00:03:25,630
way the shortcut key for that is ctrl D

88
00:03:25,630 --> 00:03:28,030
on a PC or Linux or command D on a Mac

89
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:30,880
so this is the file picker dialog and I

90
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:32,470
can use that to navigate to the other

91
00:03:32,470 --> 00:03:34,720
file so one that I want to compare to

92
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,350
this projects activity main.xml so in my

93
00:03:38,350 --> 00:03:39,580
case I've actually stored it on my

94
00:03:39,580 --> 00:03:41,410
desktop so I'm going to click on their

95
00:03:41,410 --> 00:03:43,000
activity in the school main and let's go

96
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:45,370
up here and let's go one and click on

97
00:03:45,370 --> 00:03:48,520
open you know once I've done that I've

98
00:03:48,520 --> 00:03:50,050
chosen the second floor you can see that

99
00:03:50,050 --> 00:03:52,120
the diff tool is started up with the two

100
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,270
files displayed side by side near the

101
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:58,300
top right of the window shows me how

102
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,770
many differences there are between the

103
00:03:59,770 --> 00:04:01,450
two files and you can see in this

104
00:04:01,450 --> 00:04:03,240
particular case it says no differences

105
00:04:03,240 --> 00:04:05,500
and over here it says contents are

106
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:08,410
identical now most of the window is

107
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:10,750
taken up with the two files side by side

108
00:04:10,750 --> 00:04:13,420
with matching lives aligned as far as

109
00:04:13,420 --> 00:04:13,990
possible

110
00:04:13,990 --> 00:04:16,510
now because there are no differences in

111
00:04:16,510 --> 00:04:18,580
these two files everything lines up

112
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:20,680
perfectly and I can actually scroll the

113
00:04:20,680 --> 00:04:22,600
text up and down to check that all out

114
00:04:22,600 --> 00:04:24,550
and you can see as I do that we're

115
00:04:24,550 --> 00:04:25,300
getting your

116
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:31,629
tation of both files now on the toolbar

117
00:04:31,629 --> 00:04:33,819
at the top is a button that collapses

118
00:04:33,819 --> 00:04:35,590
identical sections so that you can focus

119
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:37,900
on just the bits that are different and

120
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,240
that's this tool over here now because

121
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:42,520
these files are the same it collapses

122
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:44,319
them both completely but CC it again

123
00:04:44,319 --> 00:04:46,030
only when there are differences I'm

124
00:04:46,030 --> 00:04:47,470
gonna click it again there anyway and

125
00:04:47,470 --> 00:04:49,240
you can see by doing that there's no

126
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:51,430
text there's no where XML showing

127
00:04:51,430 --> 00:04:51,909
anymore

128
00:04:51,909 --> 00:04:54,159
again because it's only showing one it's

129
00:04:54,159 --> 00:04:56,259
different in this case the two files are

130
00:04:56,259 --> 00:04:58,900
identical no next to that is another

131
00:04:58,900 --> 00:05:01,539
button then this button synchronizes the

132
00:05:01,539 --> 00:05:03,789
scrolling of the two files you can turn

133
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:05,319
that off if you want to scroll one file

134
00:05:05,319 --> 00:05:07,240
without the other one following it and

135
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:08,979
that can be useful if you're comparing

136
00:05:08,979 --> 00:05:11,080
blocks that are in that are in different

137
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:13,120
places in the file you know with this

138
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,740
diff tool we have to do that manually

139
00:05:14,740 --> 00:05:16,960
and differences in methods that appear

140
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:18,819
in a different place in each file and

141
00:05:18,819 --> 00:05:21,759
highlighted for you next to that so we

142
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:23,319
go over there's the COG which is the

143
00:05:23,319 --> 00:05:25,509
Settings button which you can turn on

144
00:05:25,509 --> 00:05:26,919
line numbering if it isn't already on

145
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:29,199
and it's also useful just to word

146
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:31,180
disable code inspections from the

147
00:05:31,180 --> 00:05:33,039
highlight to level submenu I can click

148
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,690
on that and you can see the various

149
00:05:34,690 --> 00:05:37,150
options we've got in there now code

150
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:38,680
inspections are the warning and error

151
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:40,569
messages that appear in the margins and

152
00:05:40,569 --> 00:05:42,880
with these files lines two three and

153
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,180
four and if I just open it up again so

154
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:47,590
with these lines with these files

155
00:05:47,590 --> 00:05:49,000
launched two three and four is showing

156
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:50,680
in red in the right-hand pane and I can

157
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,789
actually come over here and click on

158
00:05:51,789 --> 00:05:55,690
that the three errors found so that can

159
00:05:55,690 --> 00:05:57,009
be distracting when you're trying to

160
00:05:57,009 --> 00:05:58,810
look for differences in the file so I

161
00:05:58,810 --> 00:06:00,460
tend to disable the inspections by

162
00:06:00,460 --> 00:06:02,830
choosing syntax from that menu by coming

163
00:06:02,830 --> 00:06:05,020
over to here highlighting level and

164
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:07,990
choosing syntax which was already

165
00:06:07,990 --> 00:06:09,610
selected but we go back and click on

166
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:11,620
highlighting level two inspections you

167
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:12,610
see there's three lines that I'm

168
00:06:12,610 --> 00:06:14,770
referring to in red so again I'm going

169
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:16,779
to just come over here highlighting

170
00:06:16,779 --> 00:06:20,650
level syntax all right so that's about

171
00:06:20,650 --> 00:06:22,690
all we can see with these files and it

172
00:06:22,690 --> 00:06:23,919
is a bit boring with the flowers are

173
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:26,110
identical after all but I have got

174
00:06:26,110 --> 00:06:28,060
another file that I didn't reformat and

175
00:06:28,060 --> 00:06:30,219
also that the widgets are in a different

176
00:06:30,219 --> 00:06:31,599
order in the componentry

177
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:33,520
so let's have a look at comparing files

178
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,490
that differ markedly so I'm going to

179
00:06:36,490 --> 00:06:38,950
close this down

180
00:06:38,950 --> 00:06:40,630
I'm going to make sure that activity

181
00:06:40,630 --> 00:06:42,850
underscore main is selected view menu

182
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:46,240
compare with this time I'm going to

183
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,790
select the activity underscore main

184
00:06:48,790 --> 00:06:51,730
underscore compared to dot XML click on

185
00:06:51,730 --> 00:06:54,610
open so we've got a completely different

186
00:06:54,610 --> 00:06:56,470
setup here and then in fact is showing

187
00:06:56,470 --> 00:06:59,770
39 differences so this is one reason why

188
00:06:59,770 --> 00:07:01,420
I recommend that you use the code

189
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,970
reformat code option and make sure that

190
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:05,380
you widgets are in the same order of

191
00:07:05,380 --> 00:07:07,750
mine before using this tool to compare

192
00:07:07,750 --> 00:07:09,520
your code to the source you can download

193
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:11,950
from the resources now what are the

194
00:07:11,950 --> 00:07:13,450
things that reformatting the code does

195
00:07:13,450 --> 00:07:16,180
is order the XML attributes in a

196
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:17,230
consistent way

197
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:19,870
so the first attribute is always the ID

198
00:07:19,870 --> 00:07:22,270
for example and you can see in the left

199
00:07:22,270 --> 00:07:25,360
hand pane that the IDS here for every

200
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:27,910
widget starts with an ID we've got the

201
00:07:27,910 --> 00:07:29,860
inner text and the textview there but in

202
00:07:29,860 --> 00:07:32,350
the right hand side file that's not

203
00:07:32,350 --> 00:07:34,270
really the case there's no such a patent

204
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,010
in other words and as I scroll through

205
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:37,480
the document it's really hard to see

206
00:07:37,480 --> 00:07:39,610
what's happening and what the important

207
00:07:39,610 --> 00:07:41,620
differences are and in fact this

208
00:07:41,620 --> 00:07:43,030
probably isn't going to help power as

209
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,670
much at all now if I'd reformatted the

210
00:07:45,670 --> 00:07:48,340
code in that second file and make sure

211
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:49,990
that the widgets were in the same order

212
00:07:49,990 --> 00:07:52,180
as my code then the differences would

213
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:54,610
actually be much easier to spot so I'm

214
00:07:54,610 --> 00:07:57,100
going to close this window down and do a

215
00:07:57,100 --> 00:07:59,980
comparison with a formatted file and the

216
00:07:59,980 --> 00:08:02,590
same thing I'm going to select activity

217
00:08:02,590 --> 00:08:05,760
main in the in the project pane view

218
00:08:05,760 --> 00:08:08,470
compared with this time I'm going to

219
00:08:08,470 --> 00:08:09,910
select another file this is activity

220
00:08:09,910 --> 00:08:11,950
underscore main underscore compare three

221
00:08:11,950 --> 00:08:16,960
dot XML open that and initially it looks

222
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:18,820
worse it says that there's actually 55

223
00:08:18,820 --> 00:08:21,310
differences but now the ordering of the

224
00:08:21,310 --> 00:08:23,470
widgets and the XML attributes have been

225
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:26,110
sorted out it's going to be much easy to

226
00:08:26,110 --> 00:08:28,330
spot the differences now firstly we can

227
00:08:28,330 --> 00:08:30,520
see that the edit text in the second

228
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,820
file has a different ID there the input

229
00:08:33,820 --> 00:08:37,180
type on line 22 you can see that's

230
00:08:37,180 --> 00:08:38,680
slightly different as well we've got

231
00:08:38,680 --> 00:08:40,900
number decimal pipe number signed

232
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:43,630
compared to number signed pipe number

233
00:08:43,630 --> 00:08:45,850
decimal so that's fine and we can ignore

234
00:08:45,850 --> 00:08:48,580
that one but the operation takes view if

235
00:08:48,580 --> 00:08:49,830
we just scroll down a little bit more

236
00:08:49,830 --> 00:08:51,700
well that's cool so I've got a few

237
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:52,779
differences you can see

238
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:55,720
that for the operation on the right hand

239
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,389
side we're using 16 DP for the various

240
00:08:58,389 --> 00:09:01,300
margins and the textview for operation

241
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:03,759
on the left is using 8 DP and in

242
00:09:03,759 --> 00:09:05,379
addition it's going to text properly set

243
00:09:05,379 --> 00:09:07,810
to a plus symbol and we haven't got that

244
00:09:07,810 --> 00:09:10,269
text attribute used at all on the left

245
00:09:10,269 --> 00:09:12,370
hand side and it's constraints are also

246
00:09:12,370 --> 00:09:14,980
slightly different now remember that end

247
00:09:14,980 --> 00:09:17,050
underscore to end of is the same as

248
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:19,209
right underscore to write off when

249
00:09:19,209 --> 00:09:21,430
dealing with constraints so it turns out

250
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:23,079
those differences aren't important but

251
00:09:23,079 --> 00:09:24,850
two older versions of Android studio

252
00:09:24,850 --> 00:09:27,309
uses left and right while Android studio

253
00:09:27,309 --> 00:09:29,949
3 currently uses start and end of course

254
00:09:29,949 --> 00:09:31,569
that could still change in the future

255
00:09:31,569 --> 00:09:34,660
now these older versions also use the

256
00:09:34,660 --> 00:09:37,899
layouts ID which is the app plus ID for

257
00:09:37,899 --> 00:09:39,639
word social activity underscore main and

258
00:09:39,639 --> 00:09:41,819
that's actually the same as parent

259
00:09:41,819 --> 00:09:43,990
you've got parrot down here you can see

260
00:09:43,990 --> 00:09:46,720
compared this is on line 37 on the Left

261
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:49,800
compared to the use of the actual

262
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,319
epicenter the app plus ID slash activity

263
00:09:53,319 --> 00:09:55,360
main on line 39 on the right hand side

264
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,610
and again that's the same as parent

265
00:09:57,610 --> 00:09:59,230
because the laird is the parent of our

266
00:09:59,230 --> 00:10:00,759
widgets so we can ignore those

267
00:10:00,759 --> 00:10:03,279
differences as well so let's move on a

268
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:04,990
little bit now look at the next one I'm

269
00:10:04,990 --> 00:10:08,069
going to come over here and click that

270
00:10:08,069 --> 00:10:10,480
it says I can actually scroll both of

271
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:12,339
them at the same time so we have a look

272
00:10:12,339 --> 00:10:15,430
at this next and it takes now the one

273
00:10:15,430 --> 00:10:16,600
that's showing here on the left

274
00:10:16,600 --> 00:10:19,120
now this next say edit text widget is

275
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:21,550
just about the same the only differences

276
00:10:21,550 --> 00:10:23,319
are those input types that we talked

277
00:10:23,319 --> 00:10:26,350
about this is on line 48 on the left

278
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:28,870
hand side in Lion 52 on the right hand

279
00:10:28,870 --> 00:10:31,809
side there's also a top margin in the

280
00:10:31,809 --> 00:10:34,689
left hand file so this is the sort of

281
00:10:34,689 --> 00:10:36,790
thing you could easily miss if you

282
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:39,759
compare the files manually now the 10

283
00:10:39,759 --> 00:10:40,839
buttons that follow have some

284
00:10:40,839 --> 00:10:42,250
differences there I can scroll down and

285
00:10:42,250 --> 00:10:43,470
we can start looking at some of those

286
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,639
the ones on the right if you have a look

287
00:10:45,639 --> 00:10:46,720
you see that they've all got their

288
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,269
minimum height set as well as a minimum

289
00:10:49,269 --> 00:10:51,579
width and we haven't got a minimum

290
00:10:51,579 --> 00:10:53,889
height showing on the left hand side

291
00:10:53,889 --> 00:10:56,319
only minimum width so using a tool like

292
00:10:56,319 --> 00:10:59,019
this makes it much easier to spot

293
00:10:59,019 --> 00:11:00,910
problems in code when you've got a

294
00:11:00,910 --> 00:11:03,029
working version to compare your code to

295
00:11:03,029 --> 00:11:05,209
now as long as you're careful

296
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:07,069
and watch carefully what you're doing

297
00:11:07,069 --> 00:11:09,110
it's possible to edit these files from

298
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:11,869
actually inside this difference tool to

299
00:11:11,869 --> 00:11:14,119
make it easier the tool provides buttons

300
00:11:14,119 --> 00:11:16,429
that will automatically synchronize

301
00:11:16,429 --> 00:11:19,279
lines then you can either transfer the

302
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:21,949
left hand code to the right or the right

303
00:11:21,949 --> 00:11:23,269
hand code to the left

304
00:11:23,269 --> 00:11:24,860
now normally you'd probably go from

305
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:27,139
right to left because the left hand side

306
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:29,059
is the file in your project and you

307
00:11:29,059 --> 00:11:30,170
probably wouldn't be checking for

308
00:11:30,170 --> 00:11:31,610
differences unless you've got a problem

309
00:11:31,610 --> 00:11:33,410
in your code so in other words you

310
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,550
probably wouldn't want to be wanting to

311
00:11:34,550 --> 00:11:36,860
update anything but the file that's in

312
00:11:36,860 --> 00:11:39,649
your project you know I'm only doing

313
00:11:39,649 --> 00:11:41,059
going to do this to show you how it

314
00:11:41,059 --> 00:11:42,949
works and I don't want to mess up my

315
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:45,019
project file so I'm going to send the

316
00:11:45,019 --> 00:11:47,059
code from the left over to the right but

317
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:48,230
bear in mind that you'd normally

318
00:11:48,230 --> 00:11:50,779
probably send in code on the right which

319
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:51,920
would be the file that you've downloaded

320
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:54,559
to compare the one on the left hand side

321
00:11:54,559 --> 00:11:57,350
so I'm going to synchronize all the

322
00:11:57,350 --> 00:11:59,389
constraints settings for the ten buttons

323
00:11:59,389 --> 00:12:01,879
on the right by copying the settings

324
00:12:01,879 --> 00:12:04,850
from the left now in the center margin

325
00:12:04,850 --> 00:12:06,769
where the line numbers are there's

326
00:12:06,769 --> 00:12:08,480
actually a little button you can see

327
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:10,939
this little greater to greater than

328
00:12:10,939 --> 00:12:13,610
signs and that synchronizes the section

329
00:12:13,610 --> 00:12:15,529
to the right and there's another one

330
00:12:15,529 --> 00:12:17,809
this size which will go the other way so

331
00:12:17,809 --> 00:12:20,990
when I click over here on button 0 this

332
00:12:20,990 --> 00:12:25,490
little button we get this warning about

333
00:12:25,490 --> 00:12:26,809
the phone up being part of the project

334
00:12:26,809 --> 00:12:28,639
but that's normal in US I said you'd

335
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:29,779
normally be going the other way and you

336
00:12:29,779 --> 00:12:32,199
wouldn't be getting that so once I click

337
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:35,720
click okay for that we can see the

338
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:37,549
change is now being a plow being applied

339
00:12:37,549 --> 00:12:40,269
and moved over to the right hand side

340
00:12:40,269 --> 00:12:42,769
now I did the minimum heart I could also

341
00:12:42,769 --> 00:12:46,249
do the streets as well the same way and

342
00:12:46,249 --> 00:12:47,990
if I changed my mind and decided that I

343
00:12:47,990 --> 00:12:50,149
didn't want that I could come over here

344
00:12:50,149 --> 00:12:51,589
and put the change back onto the left

345
00:12:51,589 --> 00:12:53,209
hand side but I'm not going to be doing

346
00:12:53,209 --> 00:12:55,160
that here so I'm I'm really just gonna

347
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:56,990
focus on the constraint settings rather

348
00:12:56,990 --> 00:12:58,579
than the minimum height adjust to show

349
00:12:58,579 --> 00:13:00,259
you how it works so as we scroll down

350
00:13:00,259 --> 00:13:02,179
now have a look a little bit more we can

351
00:13:02,179 --> 00:13:04,189
see for button 1 I'm just going to

352
00:13:04,189 --> 00:13:07,269
change the constraint button to

353
00:13:07,269 --> 00:13:10,970
constraint again we can just go in a

354
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:13,200
little bit more

355
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,779
next one for the constraint the

356
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:18,560
constraint with the button for now

357
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,089
button five will just come down and do

358
00:13:21,089 --> 00:13:22,769
the constraint and you can see it's

359
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:24,269
applying those changes over to the

360
00:13:24,269 --> 00:13:26,420
right-hand side as I'm doing that

361
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:30,079
okay scrolling down a little bit now

362
00:13:30,079 --> 00:13:33,810
next one

363
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,860
and obviously these are very minor

364
00:13:35,860 --> 00:13:37,360
little changes that have been picked up

365
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:39,430
but you can see the concept of changing

366
00:13:39,430 --> 00:13:41,710
it to is being is being applied here as

367
00:13:41,710 --> 00:13:49,510
I go through in door eight and nine and

368
00:13:49,510 --> 00:13:50,800
if I want to talk a go back and do the

369
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:54,880
same for margins as well and probably it

370
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:56,200
would be a good idea to actually do it

371
00:13:56,200 --> 00:13:57,670
all I said I wasn't going to do that but

372
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:59,320
if you think about it it probably does

373
00:13:59,320 --> 00:14:00,940
make sense because it's clearing up the

374
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,640
code and making it much easier to see

375
00:14:03,640 --> 00:14:05,740
any other differences so I'll just go

376
00:14:05,740 --> 00:14:08,780
ahead and quickly do that

377
00:14:08,780 --> 00:14:10,830
and you can see that that's where making

378
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:13,500
all those changes things are now lining

379
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,000
up a lot better as a result of that so

380
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:16,440
it did write down they'll write back up

381
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:18,540
to button zero and you can see that code

382
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:20,940
now is effectively identical we can move

383
00:14:20,940 --> 00:14:22,680
down now to the rest of the buttons I

384
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,010
just finish those off as well so still

385
00:14:26,010 --> 00:14:28,770
at the button multiply and we can do the

386
00:14:28,770 --> 00:14:31,170
same thing there's a change there

387
00:14:31,170 --> 00:14:33,030
constraint there and also the margin

388
00:14:33,030 --> 00:14:35,310
this has got a margin and a minimum

389
00:14:35,310 --> 00:14:36,780
width we can change that as well for

390
00:14:36,780 --> 00:14:39,150
button miners that's one of the minor

391
00:14:39,150 --> 00:14:41,790
change to the constraint to line and

392
00:14:41,790 --> 00:14:43,200
let's do the same for that one for

393
00:14:43,200 --> 00:14:52,470
button plus same for button dot and the

394
00:14:52,470 --> 00:14:54,210
only way now is we're right down to the

395
00:14:54,210 --> 00:14:57,780
last section now and button equals we do

396
00:14:57,780 --> 00:14:58,920
have to be a little bit careful with

397
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:00,690
this one and you should have noticed by

398
00:15:00,690 --> 00:15:02,430
now that the difficult replacing all the

399
00:15:02,430 --> 00:15:04,800
text that's highlighted in blue now if

400
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:06,690
we use the button to update the

401
00:15:06,690 --> 00:15:08,850
constraint to the right-hand file it's

402
00:15:08,850 --> 00:15:10,590
also going to remove the guideline

403
00:15:10,590 --> 00:15:12,870
widget that's this one that's on this

404
00:15:12,870 --> 00:15:14,850
side that doesn't exist on the left-hand

405
00:15:14,850 --> 00:15:16,860
side I'm going to do it anyway because

406
00:15:16,860 --> 00:15:18,660
we're not actually updating the project

407
00:15:18,660 --> 00:15:21,180
but it is important you don't just click

408
00:15:21,180 --> 00:15:22,680
without actually paying a bit of

409
00:15:22,680 --> 00:15:23,790
attention to what's actually being

410
00:15:23,790 --> 00:15:26,010
changed all right and there's the

411
00:15:26,010 --> 00:15:28,740
guideline gone and by the way if you

412
00:15:28,740 --> 00:15:30,270
clicked on one of these Chevron buttons

413
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,950
to copy code across or something doing

414
00:15:31,950 --> 00:15:34,020
but then change your mind you can do a

415
00:15:34,020 --> 00:15:36,150
control Z or commands it on a mac to

416
00:15:36,150 --> 00:15:38,400
undo the last change made and each time

417
00:15:38,400 --> 00:15:40,470
we do a command or control Z and does

418
00:15:40,470 --> 00:15:42,690
the change before that so I can do one

419
00:15:42,690 --> 00:15:45,540
on here now on okay you can see the last

420
00:15:45,540 --> 00:15:48,510
change I can do one more and I could go

421
00:15:48,510 --> 00:15:50,040
back and do it a few more times if I

422
00:15:50,040 --> 00:15:51,180
wanted to and then I going to put them

423
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,160
back if I so desire so you have got the

424
00:15:53,160 --> 00:15:54,900
ability to undo if for some reason you

425
00:15:54,900 --> 00:15:57,810
want to do that if we just don't do one

426
00:15:57,810 --> 00:16:01,920
more again keep in mind that you can

427
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:04,080
also edit the text directly in this div

428
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:05,970
tool instead of using the copy so we

429
00:16:05,970 --> 00:16:07,260
could come over here for argument sake

430
00:16:07,260 --> 00:16:09,270
for one or two and just delete that

431
00:16:09,270 --> 00:16:12,300
little bit or you can look quite still

432
00:16:12,300 --> 00:16:14,100
do that if you want to so either way

433
00:16:14,100 --> 00:16:15,930
will actually work all right at this

434
00:16:15,930 --> 00:16:18,120
point now all the buttons have their

435
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,160
constraints corrected and I've got to

436
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:22,000
the end of both files

437
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,439
now you probably saw that the right hand

438
00:16:23,439 --> 00:16:25,300
file had an extra widget a guideline

439
00:16:25,300 --> 00:16:27,790
which has now been removed we're going

440
00:16:27,790 --> 00:16:29,170
to be actually adding a guideline later

441
00:16:29,170 --> 00:16:31,060
on it's because of the guideline that

442
00:16:31,060 --> 00:16:32,560
some of the constraints were different

443
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:34,300
so I've probably broken that right hand

444
00:16:34,300 --> 00:16:36,550
file now but you can see how useful this

445
00:16:36,550 --> 00:16:38,560
difference tool is and how you can copy

446
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:40,410
code across from one file to the other

447
00:16:40,410 --> 00:16:42,670
now it's not the best differencing tool

448
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:44,439
in the world and if you already use one

449
00:16:44,439 --> 00:16:45,399
and are happy with it

450
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:47,980
you can continue to use that instead in

451
00:16:47,980 --> 00:16:49,750
fact you can integrate another diff tool

452
00:16:49,750 --> 00:16:51,939
into Android studio and show the current

453
00:16:51,939 --> 00:16:54,730
files in that tool instead the ice I've

454
00:16:54,730 --> 00:16:55,839
said there are better tools available

455
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:57,519
but this one comes with Android studio

456
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,009
and certainly beats comparing files

457
00:17:00,009 --> 00:17:02,889
manually and get it gets better in fact

458
00:17:02,889 --> 00:17:04,240
because it also allows you to compare

459
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,089
entire directories and let's have a

460
00:17:07,089 --> 00:17:10,740
brief look at that in the next video
