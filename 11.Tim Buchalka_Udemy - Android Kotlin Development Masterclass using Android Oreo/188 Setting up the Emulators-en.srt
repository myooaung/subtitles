1
00:00:04,530 --> 00:00:07,020
Before we go ahead and create our own

2
00:00:07,020 --> 00:00:09,570
content provider, it's a good idea to

3
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,670
start by using one to see exactly what a

4
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,500
content provider is and what it offers

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:15,929
and how we can take advantage of it.

6
00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:18,119
Now Android includes quite a few content

7
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:20,550
providers to allow apps to access data

8
00:00:20,550 --> 00:00:23,430
that's stored on the device now the one

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,720
that we're going to be using will allow

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,119
us to get access to the users contacts

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,580
database. When you make a phone call or

12
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:31,710
send a text message you can see all your

13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:33,809
contacts and search through them if the

14
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:35,760
contacts database was only available by

15
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:37,680
the contacts app that it wouldn't really

16
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:39,899
be a lot of use and also wouldn't make

17
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:42,030
much sense for all apps like phone or

18
00:00:42,030 --> 00:00:44,280
messaging for example to maintain their

19
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:47,010
own list of contacts, so the contacts app

20
00:00:47,010 --> 00:00:49,680
has registered a content provider and

21
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:51,750
that allows other apps to access the

22
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,300
phone's contacts provided they request

23
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,399
the necessary permissions and a user

24
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,110
grants them of course and we'll be

25
00:00:58,110 --> 00:00:59,520
seeing how to do that as we write this

26
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:01,379
up this isn't going to look very

27
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:01,980
impressive

28
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:03,899
if there are no context to display

29
00:01:03,899 --> 00:01:06,420
though and our emulators don't have any

30
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:08,610
context data on them at the moment.

31
00:01:08,610 --> 00:01:10,350
Now rather than wait until we come to run

32
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:11,909
the app before setting up some test data

33
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:13,830
on the emulators I thought I'd get that

34
00:01:13,830 --> 00:01:15,630
out of the way first so we're not

35
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:17,729
breaking the flow and having to do all

36
00:01:17,729 --> 00:01:18,990
this while trying to understand how

37
00:01:18,990 --> 00:01:22,020
content providers work so can I come

38
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:23,340
over and start the Android virtual

39
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:27,000
device manager in endured studio we're

40
00:01:27,000 --> 00:01:28,409
going to create a couple of emulators.

41
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:30,960
Now you've probably got at least one set

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:32,970
up but watch this video anyway so you

43
00:01:32,970 --> 00:01:34,770
understand how things may work slightly

44
00:01:34,770 --> 00:01:37,049
differently depending on which system

45
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:39,540
image you used to create it so what we

46
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:41,369
need for this exercise are two emulators

47
00:01:41,369 --> 00:01:43,650
so that we can see the differences

48
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:45,570
between API 23 and above

49
00:01:45,570 --> 00:01:47,340
that's the Android marshmallow to oreo at

50
00:01:47,340 --> 00:01:49,979
the moment but also versions prior to

51
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:52,860
marshmallow. Now we're only got an API 26

52
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,079
emulator set up I've actually got two as

53
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:56,520
you can see there but I'm going to

54
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:59,009
change and create a new emulator for API

55
00:01:59,009 --> 00:02:00,960
27 and then we're going to create

56
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:03,149
another one for versions prior or

57
00:02:03,149 --> 00:02:06,329
earlier than API 23 you on epub or API

58
00:02:06,329 --> 00:02:08,850
21 for that purpose so again if you've

59
00:02:08,850 --> 00:02:10,229
already got an emulator that's using

60
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,260
anything from API 16 to APR 22 and

61
00:02:13,260 --> 00:02:14,790
there's no need to create another one

62
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:16,500
unless you want to, but I'm going to do

63
00:02:16,500 --> 00:02:17,970
that in this video.

64
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:19,440
So I'm going to click on create virtual

65
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:22,110
device then we'll quickly run through we

66
00:02:22,110 --> 00:02:24,420
are creating this new device using API 21

67
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:26,750
so I'm going to select the nexus 5x

68
00:02:26,750 --> 00:02:31,890
click on next then on the x86 Images tab

69
00:02:31,890 --> 00:02:33,450
here I'm going to click on that and I'm

70
00:02:33,450 --> 00:02:36,440
going to come down and choose API 21 making

71
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:40,140
sure that I'm choosing Android Google API option

72
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:43,440
the Android 5.0 Google APIs. Now if

73
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,120
you've already created an emulator using

74
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,410
the system image that doesn't include

75
00:02:46,410 --> 00:02:49,050
the Google API then that's fine we'll be

76
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:50,550
seeing the difference that makes to the

77
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,410
contacts in a minute in fact that's the

78
00:02:52,410 --> 00:02:54,150
only reason I'm choosing the Google API

79
00:02:54,150 --> 00:02:55,920
is here so that I can show you the

80
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,020
slight difference in behavior when we

81
00:02:58,020 --> 00:03:00,210
try to access the contacts, so there's

82
00:03:00,210 --> 00:03:02,220
really no need to create another API 21

83
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:04,200
emulator if you already have one, you can

84
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:06,090
of course but you may want to save some

85
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:07,770
space, so take up about a key a

86
00:03:07,770 --> 00:03:10,920
gigabyte each. Now the GD motion

87
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:13,020
emulators work a lot better than the ARM

88
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:15,090
system images that will work fine for

89
00:03:15,090 --> 00:03:16,410
this section if you want to use them

90
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:18,600
instead we've stopped providing links

91
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,220
though to the GD motion emulators

92
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:22,440
because the site changes too frequently

93
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:24,690
you want the emulator that says free for

94
00:03:24,690 --> 00:03:26,250
personal use while you're learning from

95
00:03:26,250 --> 00:03:27,570
genie motion if you decided to go down

96
00:03:27,570 --> 00:03:29,940
that route. Once you start creating and

97
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:31,709
distributing your own apps then you'll

98
00:03:31,709 --> 00:03:34,200
need to pay for a license but generally

99
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,340
I would recommend is certain if you've

100
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:38,070
got it until CPU and your computer that

101
00:03:38,070 --> 00:03:39,840
the images that come with Android studio

102
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:42,150
are more than sufficient and certainly

103
00:03:42,150 --> 00:03:43,410
fast enough it's only when you get into

104
00:03:43,410 --> 00:03:46,110
the situation of having an AMD CPU or an

105
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:48,600
Intel CPU you have to use these other

106
00:03:48,600 --> 00:03:51,239
images these ARM images which are just

107
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:54,420
too slow to be practical. Alright so

108
00:03:54,420 --> 00:03:57,720
I've chosen the lollipop 21 x86 making

109
00:03:57,720 --> 00:03:58,980
sure I've selected the Google API

110
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,260
version there, I'm gonna click on next

111
00:04:01,260 --> 00:04:04,530
and I suggest you change the AVD name

112
00:04:04,530 --> 00:04:05,700
here what I'm going to do is just go

113
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:08,760
with Nexus 5x APR 21 by gonna call this

114
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:11,040
context just so it's really clear that

115
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:12,540
this is the emulator that I've set up

116
00:04:12,540 --> 00:04:15,630
for that purpose and okay I'll click on

117
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,890
finish brother and we're done

118
00:04:16,890 --> 00:04:18,959
I'll give it a moment to more complete

119
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,630
and we've now got our Nexus 5x APR 21

120
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,540
contacts emulator set up I'm gonna

121
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:29,130
immediately start that up they're going

122
00:04:29,130 --> 00:04:31,790
to close down

123
00:04:31,790 --> 00:04:35,190
the virtual device window and we'll

124
00:04:35,190 --> 00:04:36,750
bring back the emulator not still

125
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:43,530
loading up, we'll just make this a little

126
00:04:43,530 --> 00:04:48,420
bit bigger. Okay so I'm gonna click on ok,

127
00:04:48,420 --> 00:04:51,000
there so next whether they'll launch the

128
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,070
contacts app and create a few contacts

129
00:04:53,070 --> 00:04:55,380
for testing. Now here's where things get

130
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:57,450
a bit different if your emulator uses a

131
00:04:57,450 --> 00:05:00,030
system image with the Google API which

132
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:02,130
I've actually set up here. Now if your

133
00:05:02,130 --> 00:05:04,680
image doesn't use the Google API you'll

134
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,960
have a screen with three buttons let me

135
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,060
just start this so you can see I could

136
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:10,320
have clicked it from the main screen

137
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,820
when I was coming into here and clicking

138
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:15,120
on contacts so basically if you didn't

139
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:17,040
use the Google API was you'd have a

140
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:18,570
screen immediately with three buttons

141
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:21,390
with the top one letting you create a

142
00:05:21,390 --> 00:05:23,520
new contact so if that's the case please

143
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:25,320
bear with us while the rest of us catch

144
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,020
up, now if you've included the Google API

145
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:30,120
so I have then you'll be asked to sign

146
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:31,800
in to the device before you can work

147
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:33,690
with the contacts like it's doing here

148
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:35,700
on my screen, so I'll pause the video now,

149
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:37,590
now while I enter my details on the

150
00:05:37,590 --> 00:05:38,700
screen and I'm going to click on next

151
00:05:38,700 --> 00:05:41,540
and we'll come back and continue.

152
00:05:41,540 --> 00:05:44,010
Alright so after entering the username and

153
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:46,350
password you get to this screen so we

154
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:47,910
can click on more down here to see more

155
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:51,210
information and we can click on yes I'm

156
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,100
in or accept, yes I'm in accept to

157
00:05:56,100 --> 00:05:59,610
accept the terms we then get to this

158
00:05:59,610 --> 00:06:02,310
screen after that. Now I'm using a test

159
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:03,840
account but if you're using your live

160
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,240
gmail account with all your real contact

161
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:08,460
details then I'd suggest you don't let

162
00:06:08,460 --> 00:06:10,470
Apps access them until after we've

163
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,810
tested them testing on your live data

164
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:13,920
could be a good way to lose your

165
00:06:13,920 --> 00:06:16,410
contacts. Now this happens only reading

166
00:06:16,410 --> 00:06:18,720
the contacts data not writing to it but

167
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,460
even so it's a good habit to get into

168
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:21,810
don't test apps using production

169
00:06:21,810 --> 00:06:24,240
databases always work with test data

170
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,760
until you're sure it's working, so it's a

171
00:06:26,760 --> 00:06:28,050
good idea to create another gmail

172
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,240
account for testing that way you don't

173
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,490
risk messing up your real data so what

174
00:06:32,490 --> 00:06:34,080
I'm going to do is uncheck this box or

175
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,730
will actually turn this off by sliding

176
00:06:35,730 --> 00:06:37,530
this little slider over here so that

177
00:06:37,530 --> 00:06:40,350
it's not backing up to Google Drive I'm

178
00:06:40,350 --> 00:06:43,670
going to scroll down and click on next

179
00:06:43,670 --> 00:06:46,640
and now we're all on the same screen

180
00:06:46,640 --> 00:06:49,070
this is where the contacts app starts if

181
00:06:49,070 --> 00:06:51,170
you haven't included the Google API is

182
00:06:51,170 --> 00:06:53,480
in the system image. Alright so let's

183
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,700
create a new contact by clicking on this

184
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,990
top button create a new contact now the

185
00:06:59,990 --> 00:07:02,060
first time I do that I get this screen

186
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:03,830
giving an option to back up the contacts

187
00:07:03,830 --> 00:07:06,080
that we add or at least I would get that

188
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:07,850
unless I'm logged into Google in this

189
00:07:07,850 --> 00:07:09,110
account you can see it's automatically

190
00:07:09,110 --> 00:07:10,220
saying your new account will be

191
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,410
synchronized and it shows synchronized

192
00:07:12,410 --> 00:07:14,390
with and whatever gmail account that you

193
00:07:14,390 --> 00:07:17,180
use to sign in to this device this

194
00:07:17,180 --> 00:07:19,940
emulator, you may also be prompted if you

195
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,920
weren't able to login successfully to

196
00:07:21,920 --> 00:07:23,840
keep local so I would normally recommend

197
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,510
you to keep local in that scenario but

198
00:07:26,510 --> 00:07:27,620
in this case I'm just going to click on

199
00:07:27,620 --> 00:07:30,800
ok and that brings us to the Google

200
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:33,680
contact moon page now. So once again I'm

201
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:35,450
advising against using your normal

202
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:37,640
Google Account on an emulator if you do

203
00:07:37,640 --> 00:07:39,800
manage to set it to sync the data so if

204
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,030
you did get the option to make sure you

205
00:07:41,030 --> 00:07:43,160
choose keep local. Alright so now that

206
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:45,050
we're on this screen now I'm not gonna

207
00:07:45,050 --> 00:07:46,430
enter data for the email and phone

208
00:07:46,430 --> 00:07:47,630
number at this stage because there any

209
00:07:47,630 --> 00:07:49,520
displaying the name anyhow, so what I'm

210
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:50,720
going to do is just create a couple of

211
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,820
entries I'm going to top mark submit

212
00:07:52,820 --> 00:07:55,940
this the first one and then I'm gonna do

213
00:07:55,940 --> 00:07:57,110
another one so I'm gonna click on the

214
00:07:57,110 --> 00:08:00,110
little tick here to save it known as

215
00:08:00,110 --> 00:08:01,670
noting now that time we've got an entry

216
00:08:01,670 --> 00:08:03,230
out of there it's nothing about it that

217
00:08:03,230 --> 00:08:04,880
you can see here this add phone number

218
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:06,680
net email I'm not going to add those for

219
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:08,660
Mike in his case we're really only going

220
00:08:08,660 --> 00:08:11,120
to be displaying the name in our test

221
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:12,560
app anyway so I'm gonna click on back

222
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:15,050
then then I'm going to click on the

223
00:08:15,050 --> 00:08:16,340
button down the bottom right to add

224
00:08:16,340 --> 00:08:18,740
another contact let's call this one Bob

225
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:23,360
Brown and click on the little tick there

226
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:26,120
to say that to come back and you can see

227
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:28,100
we've now got two entries in our

228
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,050
contacts now and that should do for now

229
00:08:30,050 --> 00:08:31,340
you can do two more if you want to but

230
00:08:31,340 --> 00:08:33,380
that's enough for our demonstration.

231
00:08:33,380 --> 00:08:35,600
Now we also want to run the app on an API 23

232
00:08:35,600 --> 00:08:37,340
or higher emulator so I'm going to go

233
00:08:37,340 --> 00:08:38,690
and repeat the process now to add the

234
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:41,060
same contact details to an emulator

235
00:08:41,060 --> 00:08:43,940
running Android Audio API 27 in this

236
00:08:43,940 --> 00:08:46,750
case so I'm going to close this down

237
00:08:46,750 --> 00:08:49,010
then what I'll actually do is after we

238
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,320
go on create the emulator, I'll fast

239
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:52,700
forward this just so it doesn't take too

240
00:08:52,700 --> 00:08:56,120
long to finish, you can see that I've got

241
00:08:56,120 --> 00:08:57,590
an API 26 emulator

242
00:08:57,590 --> 00:08:59,860
we're not going to create a new API 27,

243
00:08:59,860 --> 00:09:02,020
so going to go through the same process

244
00:09:02,020 --> 00:09:05,570
I'm going to choose to go to x86 images

245
00:09:05,570 --> 00:09:09,010
then we want to choose the Oreo Android

246
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:11,360
8.1 Google API so I'm choosing the

247
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:14,270
latest API there, next I'm going to do

248
00:09:14,270 --> 00:09:15,320
the same thing there I'm going to put

249
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:19,130
contacts just so we can differentiate

250
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:21,100
click on finish

251
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,230
I'm going to start that new emulator so

252
00:09:27,230 --> 00:09:37,160
close down the virtual devices page

253
00:09:37,160 --> 00:09:41,690
like this a bit bigger what sliding okay

254
00:09:41,690 --> 00:09:43,250
now it's loaded we're going to click on

255
00:09:43,250 --> 00:09:47,270
the button click on contacts I click on

256
00:09:47,270 --> 00:09:50,900
plus here it says take a minute to add

257
00:09:50,900 --> 00:09:52,040
an account that will backup your

258
00:09:52,040 --> 00:09:54,110
contacts to Google this is API 27 I'm

259
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:56,000
going to click on cancel there I don't

260
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,850
want to actually add one for to add our

261
00:09:58,850 --> 00:10:00,680
accounts to Google it's just a quicker

262
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,090
way to know that we can access it you

263
00:10:02,090 --> 00:10:03,410
can see that it's different to what the

264
00:10:03,410 --> 00:10:04,730
process was for our Android lollipop

265
00:10:04,730 --> 00:10:08,450
device, so I'm Mike Smith notice also

266
00:10:08,450 --> 00:10:09,770
that we've got a first in the last name

267
00:10:09,770 --> 00:10:11,660
column that's a little bit different I'm

268
00:10:11,660 --> 00:10:15,530
gonna click on save up here there's mark

269
00:10:15,530 --> 00:10:17,690
you can see the interface is a little

270
00:10:17,690 --> 00:10:18,740
bit different because we're running a

271
00:10:18,740 --> 00:10:21,260
later API version, click on the plus and

272
00:10:21,260 --> 00:10:26,360
let's add Bob Brown as well and click on

273
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:29,540
save and we actually got the two entries

274
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:31,070
and you probably saw that anyway about

275
00:10:31,070 --> 00:10:32,690
noting that because I didn't add a

276
00:10:32,690 --> 00:10:35,480
Google Account saving to devices as I

277
00:10:35,480 --> 00:10:36,920
specified there, alright so I'm going to

278
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,090
click on back at the moment.

279
00:10:40,090 --> 00:10:42,290
Alright, so done through all this now so

280
00:10:42,290 --> 00:10:44,390
that you might be asking at this point

281
00:10:44,390 --> 00:10:46,340
what did we create to emulate API

282
00:10:46,340 --> 00:10:49,010
23 one the Android lollipop one and the

283
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:51,110
Android Oreo one. Well the reason that

284
00:10:51,110 --> 00:10:53,300
we've added this second one the API 23

285
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,730
or higher emulator the API 27 in our

286
00:10:55,730 --> 00:10:58,100
case is that Google changed the way that

287
00:10:58,100 --> 00:10:59,540
permissions worked in Android

288
00:10:59,540 --> 00:11:01,910
marshmallow and that was API 23,

289
00:11:01,910 --> 00:11:03,260
once we've seen the app running on API 21

290
00:11:03,260 --> 00:11:05,330
we'll have to look at what we need to

291
00:11:05,330 --> 00:11:07,550
change in our code to make it work on

292
00:11:07,550 --> 00:11:10,370
Android versions from API 23 on, so we

293
00:11:10,370 --> 00:11:11,840
need two emulators do we have to do that

294
00:11:11,840 --> 00:11:13,730
and I've gone through all this process

295
00:11:13,730 --> 00:11:16,250
now so that when we need this data it'll

296
00:11:16,250 --> 00:11:17,720
be there ready for use and we don't have

297
00:11:17,720 --> 00:11:19,400
to get distracted from what we're doing

298
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,500
when we come to run the app, so make sure

299
00:11:21,500 --> 00:11:23,030
you remember which emulators you've

300
00:11:23,030 --> 00:11:25,190
added these contacts in and you can see

301
00:11:25,190 --> 00:11:26,990
in my case that I just named them with

302
00:11:26,990 --> 00:11:29,090
the word contacts at the end of the

303
00:11:29,090 --> 00:11:30,860
emulator name because you'll need to get

304
00:11:30,860 --> 00:11:32,900
access to those for our testing purposes.

305
00:11:32,900 --> 00:11:34,880
So let's end the video here and we'll

306
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:36,410
make a start on using the contact

307
00:11:36,410 --> 00:11:40,210
provider in the next video.
