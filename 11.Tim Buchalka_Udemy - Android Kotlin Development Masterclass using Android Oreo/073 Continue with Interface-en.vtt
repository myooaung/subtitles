00:00:04.720 --> 00:00:06.819

all right so as I mentioned in the last



2

00:00:06.819 --> 00:00:08.350

video we've now got a nice group of



3

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.270

buttons that we can drag around it's a



4

00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:13.360

single object and what we need to do now



5

00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:16.000

is add the IDS of the remaining six



6

00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.699

buttons to be changed and also their tax



7

00:00:18.699 --> 00:00:20.260

change to show the symbol for the



8

00:00:20.260 --> 00:00:21.940

operation that they're going to be



9

00:00:21.940 --> 00:00:24.220

performing in our calculator app so I'm



10

00:00:24.220 --> 00:00:26.980

going to start now with down here button



11

00:00:26.980 --> 00:00:30.360

the 11 will make that the divide button



12

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:37.780

so we'll call it button divided and the



13

00:00:37.780 --> 00:00:42.039

text for that will be a slash the next



14

00:00:42.039 --> 00:00:48.760

one a button multiply multiply and



15

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:53.579

that's going to be an S tricks or a star



16

00:00:53.579 --> 00:00:57.429

next we want a button miners to perform



17

00:00:57.429 --> 00:01:02.769

a subtraction button - and that'll be a



18

00:01:02.769 --> 00:01:07.120

- for the minus sign we want a button



19

00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.360

dot so we can enter decimal numbers so



20

00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:14.730

that's going to be I mean numbers with



21

00:01:14.730 --> 00:01:16.900

decimal point or what's the decimal



22

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:19.540

point so we can add numbers after the



23

00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:23.200

decimal point so it's button dot and the



24

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:25.210

text for that will be a period or the



25

00:01:25.210 --> 00:01:30.580

dot and then we want also a button for



26

00:01:30.580 --> 00:01:39.700

equals button equals and that's going to



27

00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:44.710

be equals and I miss one app I need a



28

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:46.120

button plus two of course with



29

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.970

everything else but button plus size for



30

00:01:48.970 --> 00:01:50.290

dish and obviously it's a button plus



31

00:01:50.290 --> 00:01:55.210

and that will be the plus sign okay so



32

00:01:55.210 --> 00:01:57.130

there's all their buttons all right now



33

00:01:57.130 --> 00:02:00.460

in terms of locations what we haven't



34

00:02:00.460 --> 00:02:02.290

done yet is we haven't moved button zero



35

00:02:02.290 --> 00:02:04.690

so let's just move button 0 first no



36

00:02:04.690 --> 00:02:07.420

button zeros constrained at the top to



37

00:02:07.420 --> 00:02:09.009

the bottom of button one so let's start



38

00:02:09.009 --> 00:02:12.510

with that let's turn it to button one



39

00:02:12.510 --> 00:02:14.860

and it's lifted it should be constrained



40

00:02:14.860 --> 00:02:16.420

to the left edge of button once we've



41

00:02:16.420 --> 00:02:18.970

done for the other numbers on this



42

00:02:18.970 --> 00:02:23.260

so let's go ahead and do that and then



43

00:02:23.260 --> 00:02:24.580

we also want to make sure the margins



44

00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.160

set to eight which it is there which is



45

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:28.630

wrong here because we want to move it



46

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:32.140

over so we set that to zero so that fits



47

00:02:32.140 --> 00:02:35.350

nicely sit snug there all right so next



48

00:02:35.350 --> 00:02:37.780

one is the button dot that goes to the



49

00:02:37.780 --> 00:02:40.000

right of button zero that's this one



50

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.370

here I'm gonna select that let's go



51

00:02:42.370 --> 00:02:48.730

ahead and place that here we need to do



52

00:02:48.730 --> 00:02:50.260

the same baseline constraint that we've



53

00:02:50.260 --> 00:02:56.709

been doing okay and then we need a the



54

00:02:56.709 --> 00:02:59.709

equal sign is next equals this going to



55

00:02:59.709 --> 00:03:01.660

be to the right of that and then plus



56

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:03.520

will be to the right of that so let's



57

00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:06.940

say that equals first I'll strain it to



58

00:03:06.940 --> 00:03:11.080

the left set it up for the baseline and



59

00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:13.480

constrain it to the base line like so



60

00:03:13.480 --> 00:03:16.180

and we want another one there as I



61

00:03:16.180 --> 00:03:17.440

mentioned the plus I'm gonna click on



62

00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:21.670

the plus constrain it to the left and



63

00:03:21.670 --> 00:03:27.340

then also do the baseline constraint to



64

00:03:27.340 --> 00:03:29.590

move it up like so all right so this



65

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:31.120

point we've got to three other buttons



66

00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:34.870

that we need to set now we've got button



67

00:03:34.870 --> 00:03:36.820

devoid let's do that one first that goes



68

00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:38.590

to the right of the number nine so



69

00:03:38.590 --> 00:03:44.260

button divide but the constraint on the



70

00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:46.390

left there and then also making sure



71

00:03:46.390 --> 00:03:48.820

it's still selected do the same for the



72

00:03:48.820 --> 00:03:54.970

baseline like so and next we've got the



73

00:03:54.970 --> 00:03:58.720

multiply let's do that that's going to



74

00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:03.160

be to the right of six strain it to the



75

00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:05.920

right of right edge of six and do the



76

00:04:05.920 --> 00:04:09.760

baseline and move it to the baseline for



77

00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:15.280

six and the last one let's turn it to



78

00:04:15.280 --> 00:04:17.049

the right of 3 this is the minus sign



79

00:04:17.049 --> 00:04:19.959

and we'll do a baseline constraint as



80

00:04:19.959 --> 00:04:24.490

well to the three all right so that's



81

00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:27.099

all 16 buttons that have now been



82

00:04:27.099 --> 00:04:30.610

completed now there was a frustrating



83

00:04:30.610 --> 00:04:32.680

issue with previous versions of Android



84

00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:35.080

giulio but fortunately it seems to have



85

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:37.449

gone it's worth mentioning my partly in



86

00:04:37.449 --> 00:04:39.250

case it comes back and partly because it



87

00:04:39.250 --> 00:04:41.440

involves a couple of attributes that you



88

00:04:41.440 --> 00:04:43.990

should know about so I'm going to select



89

00:04:43.990 --> 00:04:46.300

one of the buttons in my case I'm going



90

00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:48.490

to select the minus button that was



91

00:04:48.490 --> 00:04:49.570

already selected because that was the



92

00:04:49.570 --> 00:04:52.000

last one we moved we want to expand out



93

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.070

the attribute you see and we click on



94

00:04:54.070 --> 00:04:56.889

the expanded expanded data attributes



95

00:04:56.889 --> 00:05:03.160

and let's scroll down over here until we



96

00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.759

get to min height and min width now by



97

00:05:06.759 --> 00:05:10.120

default min width used to be set to 88



98

00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.580

DP and that caused the width to keep



99

00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:14.110

resetting if you tried to make the



100

00:05:14.110 --> 00:05:16.180

button narrow but fortunately you can



101

00:05:16.180 --> 00:05:17.830

see here that it's not set that's no



102

00:05:17.830 --> 00:05:19.930

longer the case but if you happen to get



103

00:05:19.930 --> 00:05:21.849

problems with widgets not resizing or



104

00:05:21.849 --> 00:05:24.130

resetting after you resize them then



105

00:05:24.130 --> 00:05:26.590

check out these min width and min height



106

00:05:26.590 --> 00:05:29.530

in the extended attributes to make sure



107

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.270

they're not causing your problems and to



108

00:05:31.270 --> 00:05:33.070

a lesser extent keep an eye on the max



109

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:35.520

width and max Heights attributes as well



110

00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:38.800

all right so I'm not going to change the



111

00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:40.599

width of the buttons manually because



112

00:05:40.599 --> 00:05:42.820

the text they contain could be resized



113

00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:45.669

independently now users can select large



114

00:05:45.669 --> 00:05:47.650

fonts for the display which could make



115

00:05:47.650 --> 00:05:49.690

the text look a bit ugly if the buttons



116

00:05:49.690 --> 00:05:52.240

don't resize as well so we want to leave



117

00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:55.120

our buttons set to wrap content now you



118

00:05:55.120 --> 00:05:57.159

could change the size to fixed and size



119

00:05:57.159 --> 00:06:00.520

them to 48dp say but bear in mind that



120

00:06:00.520 --> 00:06:02.710

font size isn't under your complete



121

00:06:02.710 --> 00:06:05.139

control so let Brep underscore content



122

00:06:05.139 --> 00:06:07.000

use a smaller button size where possible



123

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:08.740

you want to change the min width



124

00:06:08.740 --> 00:06:11.590

attribute to 48 DP so I'm going to go



125

00:06:11.590 --> 00:06:12.550

ahead and do that and again I've got



126

00:06:12.550 --> 00:06:14.979

everything selected here and I've got my



127

00:06:14.979 --> 00:06:16.690

- on selected here so I'm going to come



128

00:06:16.690 --> 00:06:19.300

over here to min width and I'm going to



129

00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:25.710

change that now to 48 DP and press Enter



130

00:06:25.710 --> 00:06:28.000

and you can see the buttons move that



131

00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:29.800

all the size down there by doing that



132

00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:32.289

now it would get a bit tedious changing



133

00:06:32.289 --> 00:06:34.599

each button individually but what we can



134

00:06:34.599 --> 00:06:36.820

do is select them all and change them



135

00:06:36.820 --> 00:06:37.440

all in one go



136

00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:39.610

now I've already shown you how to select



137

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:41.080

all the buttons by dragging over them



138

00:06:41.080 --> 00:06:43.240

another way which can be useful if



139

00:06:43.240 --> 00:06:44.950

you've got other widgets in the way is



140

00:06:44.950 --> 00:06:46.060

the right-click



141

00:06:46.060 --> 00:06:50.080

- over here and then I can actually



142

00:06:50.080 --> 00:06:52.300

choose select and then same select type



143

00:06:52.300 --> 00:06:58.600

select select the same type and you can



144

00:06:58.600 --> 00:07:00.190

see this automatically selected all the



145

00:07:00.190 --> 00:07:02.290

other buttons then we're going to change



146

00:07:02.290 --> 00:07:04.480

changing the min width attribute now



147

00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:07.870

we'll sell it for all buttons but what's



148

00:07:07.870 --> 00:07:09.160

happened to min width you can see it's



149

00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.169

actually disappeared seems to have



150

00:07:11.169 --> 00:07:12.610

vanished from the attributes



151

00:07:12.610 --> 00:07:15.130

well Android studio tries to be helpful



152

00:07:15.130 --> 00:07:17.620

and once you've changed an attribute it



153

00:07:17.620 --> 00:07:19.570

moves up to the top of the attributes



154

00:07:19.570 --> 00:07:22.360

list now this list is sort of



155

00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:23.979

alphabetical but arranged in two



156

00:07:23.979 --> 00:07:26.919

sections now attributes that G changed



157

00:07:26.919 --> 00:07:29.020

appeared alphabetically at the top then



158

00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:31.270

the list silence then the list starts



159

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.889

again alphabetically with all the other



160

00:07:32.889 --> 00:07:34.780

widgets so if we scroll back up to the



161

00:07:34.780 --> 00:07:39.100

top now because here we've got our min



162

00:07:39.100 --> 00:07:42.070

width over here and we're gonna go over



163

00:07:42.070 --> 00:07:45.970

here and change that to 48 DP press



164

00:07:45.970 --> 00:07:49.330

enter and you can see all butts and



165

00:07:49.330 --> 00:07:51.910

they'll been resized and the other thing



166

00:07:51.910 --> 00:07:53.320

you want to do is just make sure that



167

00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:56.020

the layout width and layout height is



168

00:07:56.020 --> 00:07:57.880

set to wrap content before run selecting



169

00:07:57.880 --> 00:07:59.590

them you can see here that that is the



170

00:07:59.590 --> 00:08:02.020

case now if you're setting these same



171

00:08:02.020 --> 00:08:05.020

properties for many widgets at once what



172

00:08:05.020 --> 00:08:06.430

I've shown you here makes life a lot



173

00:08:06.430 --> 00:08:09.100

easier now not all properties can be set



174

00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:10.990

for groups of widgets at the same time



175

00:08:10.990 --> 00:08:12.610

so although this is a useful feature



176

00:08:12.610 --> 00:08:14.320

there are times when you just have to



177

00:08:14.320 --> 00:08:17.020

set each one individually alright so



178

00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:19.270

just click in anywhere now any blank



179

00:08:19.270 --> 00:08:21.340

part of the layout - and select the



180

00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.760

buttons now before I move on to add the



181

00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:26.919

Forgotten widgets let's have another



182

00:08:26.919 --> 00:08:28.539

look at the component tree over to the



183

00:08:28.539 --> 00:08:31.270

left now although it generally makes no



184

00:08:31.270 --> 00:08:33.370

difference what all of the pages the



185

00:08:33.370 --> 00:08:36.039

widgets appear in here you can put them



186

00:08:36.039 --> 00:08:38.050

in a more logical order reflecting their



187

00:08:38.050 --> 00:08:40.030

position on the screen by dragging them



188

00:08:40.030 --> 00:08:41.740

up and down to sort them into an order



189

00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:44.080

that makes sense and it'll also be easy



190

00:08:44.080 --> 00:08:46.150

to find the individual digit buttons to



191

00:08:46.150 --> 00:08:48.040

select them if they appear in numerical



192

00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:49.360

order and they should probably be all



193

00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:50.920

together so I'm going to drag the



194

00:08:50.920 --> 00:08:52.660

widgets around now just to reorder them



195

00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:54.760

we've got button 0 I'm going to move



196

00:08:54.760 --> 00:08:58.660

button 1 up here we've got buttons now 0



197

00:08:58.660 --> 00:08:59.870

through 9



198

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:01.940

well if the result text still at the top



199

00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:05.660

then we've got divide multiply miners



200

00:09:05.660 --> 00:09:11.270

let's actually move plus up and then



201

00:09:11.270 --> 00:09:14.060

we've got Donna Nichols now this HAP the



202

00:09:14.060 --> 00:09:15.740

author makes no difference to the way



203

00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:18.080

the layout works but it does reflect the



204

00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:20.710

order that the widgets appear in the XML



205

00:09:20.710 --> 00:09:23.630

now if you're using nested layouts then



206

00:09:23.630 --> 00:09:25.940

make sure you don't drag a widget out of



207

00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.340

its container now that may not mean much



208

00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.080

now but I will be looking at nested



209

00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:32.660

layouts later also be careful with



210

00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.940

linear layouts because the ordering of



211

00:09:34.940 --> 00:09:37.040

the widgets does matter then but we're



212

00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:38.210

going to be looking at nested layouts



213

00:09:38.210 --> 00:09:40.870

and linear layouts later in the course



214

00:09:40.870 --> 00:09:43.520

alright so time to suddenly remember



215

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:45.920

that we need two more widgets a text



216

00:09:45.920 --> 00:09:48.170

view to display the operation and an



217

00:09:48.170 --> 00:09:50.180

edit text to allow new numbers to be



218

00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.970

entered now although you could drag the



219

00:09:52.970 --> 00:09:54.410

buttons out of the way to make more room



220

00:09:54.410 --> 00:09:57.110

there's really no need what I'm going to



221

00:09:57.110 --> 00:09:59.440

do is place a textview in a side number



222

00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.120

enter text in a space below the buttons



223

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.520

then delete the vertical constraint on



224

00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:06.980

button 7 and while I've still got plenty



225

00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:08.060

of room on the screen then I'm going to



226

00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:10.280

set the left edge of the textview to be



227

00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.600

constrained to the left edge of the



228

00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:14.540

layout and it's right edge to the left



229

00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.120

edge of the inner text let's actually



230

00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:18.440

start doing some of this so we'll start



231

00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.550

with the textview or drag one out and



232

00:10:22.550 --> 00:10:23.930

just put it down the bottom of the



233

00:10:23.930 --> 00:10:24.980

screen here anywhere doesn't really



234

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.660

matter and we always have what that side



235

00:10:26.660 --> 00:10:28.220

number and it takes me talked about as



236

00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:35.750

well okay just put it down there so



237

00:10:35.750 --> 00:10:37.220

again I'm going to set the left edge of



238

00:10:37.220 --> 00:10:38.870

the textview to be constrained to the



239

00:10:38.870 --> 00:10:40.220

left edge of the layout so let's start



240

00:10:40.220 --> 00:10:46.190

with that and the right edge to be to



241

00:10:46.190 --> 00:10:53.150

the left edge of the edit text



242

00:10:53.150 --> 00:10:55.220

I'm also going to constrain the top edge



243

00:10:55.220 --> 00:10:57.500

of the textview to the top of the new



244

00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:01.250

edit text the top edge is going to be



245

00:11:01.250 --> 00:11:03.050

constrained to the top edge of the other



246

00:11:03.050 --> 00:11:04.910

text on the new edit text that is I'm



247

00:11:04.910 --> 00:11:06.890

going to click on that you can see



248

00:11:06.890 --> 00:11:09.529

that's moved down there and then we want



249

00:11:09.529 --> 00:11:12.290

to change the right edge and what to



250

00:11:12.290 --> 00:11:13.880

involve me moving this fractionally over



251

00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.800

here so we can see what we're doing so



252

00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:19.100

at the right edge of the text view now



253

00:11:19.100 --> 00:11:21.620

to be constrained to the left edge of



254

00:11:21.620 --> 00:11:24.410

the edit text and you can see I've



255

00:11:24.410 --> 00:11:26.089

already done that so that's setup so if



256

00:11:26.089 --> 00:11:27.260

I come back and have a look up here in



257

00:11:27.260 --> 00:11:30.170

the inspector the textview we know we've



258

00:11:30.170 --> 00:11:32.360

got a constraint on the left to the left



259

00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:34.580

edge of the layout to the right of the



260

00:11:34.580 --> 00:11:37.640

or the right constraint from the



261

00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:39.320

textview is no constraint to the left of



262

00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:41.060

the edit view and the top is also



263

00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:43.010

constrained to the top of the new edit



264

00:11:43.010 --> 00:11:46.220

text as well now we could have probably



265

00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:48.440

we should probably be using the baseline



266

00:11:48.440 --> 00:11:50.720

constraint here but I've used top so



267

00:11:50.720 --> 00:11:51.740

that I can show you another way to



268

00:11:51.740 --> 00:11:54.440

change it later alright so here now



269

00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:56.420

constrain the top of this new edit text



270

00:11:56.420 --> 00:11:58.100

to the bottom of the first one we added



271

00:11:58.100 --> 00:12:00.620

called result and then constrain the top



272

00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:03.860

of button 7 to the bottom of this one so



273

00:12:03.860 --> 00:12:05.839

what I constrain the top of the new edit



274

00:12:05.839 --> 00:12:10.100

text to the bottom of the old one you



275

00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:12.770

can see when I do that the text view and



276

00:12:12.770 --> 00:12:14.959

edit text combination obscure button 7



277

00:12:14.959 --> 00:12:17.330

that makes it difficult to change the



278

00:12:17.330 --> 00:12:19.220

constraint on button 7 certainly



279

00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:21.350

possible but what I'm going to do is do



280

00:12:21.350 --> 00:12:22.459

it the other way around so I'm going to



281

00:12:22.459 --> 00:12:24.830

undo that change using command Z or a



282

00:12:24.830 --> 00:12:27.709

may Accords controls yet on a PC you can



283

00:12:27.709 --> 00:12:30.529

see that and does the last one now what



284

00:12:30.529 --> 00:12:32.240

we'll do instead is we'll delete the top



285

00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:35.029

constraint on button 7 and go over here



286

00:12:35.029 --> 00:12:36.620

to button 7 select it and delete the



287

00:12:36.620 --> 00:12:39.230

constraint then what we're going to do



288

00:12:39.230 --> 00:12:40.910

is drag a constraint from the top of



289

00:12:40.910 --> 00:12:43.520

button 7 to the bottom of the new tip of



290

00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:45.709

the new where edit text I'm going to do



291

00:12:45.709 --> 00:12:51.140

that you can see then that the entire



292

00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:52.640

square of buttons moves us a single



293

00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:54.230

block and that's because they're all



294

00:12:54.230 --> 00:12:56.360

ultimately constrained to button 7 so



295

00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:57.220

that's pretty cool



296

00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.110

whatever we constrain button 7 to the



297

00:13:00.110 --> 00:13:01.880

rest of the buttons will follow okay



298

00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:05.089

half of them probably in my case you can



299

00:13:05.089 --> 00:13:06.209

see our 4



300

00:13:06.209 --> 00:13:08.040

I probably off the bottom of the screen



301

00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:10.050

but don't worry about that what we can



302

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:11.850

now do is drag a constraint from the top



303

00:13:11.850 --> 00:13:14.670

of this new edit text to the bottom of



304

00:13:14.670 --> 00:13:15.959

the result edit text and everything



305

00:13:15.959 --> 00:13:19.529

should come back right and you can see



306

00:13:19.529 --> 00:13:22.199

that it's come back it should be obvious



307

00:13:22.199 --> 00:13:23.790

by now that you don't position widgets



308

00:13:23.790 --> 00:13:25.170

on the screen by dragging them into



309

00:13:25.170 --> 00:13:27.899

place you do it by creating constraints



310

00:13:27.899 --> 00:13:29.670

and it's these constraints that



311

00:13:29.670 --> 00:13:31.350

determine where the widgets will appear



312

00:13:31.350 --> 00:13:34.439

when you run the app now I should really



313

00:13:34.439 --> 00:13:36.449

have a site have a side more informative



314

00:13:36.449 --> 00:13:39.300

IDs to these two new widgets first but I



315

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:40.679

wanted to show you what happens when you



316

00:13:40.679 --> 00:13:43.410

change an ID once the widgets used by



317

00:13:43.410 --> 00:13:45.569

something else either by constraints in



318

00:13:45.569 --> 00:13:48.389

the layout or in code so I'm going to



319

00:13:48.389 --> 00:13:51.089

first start with this new ID which I've



320

00:13:51.089 --> 00:13:52.709

already got selected but clicking if



321

00:13:52.709 --> 00:13:54.509

it's not selected I'm going to change



322

00:13:54.509 --> 00:14:02.540

the ID that a new number new number and



323

00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:07.019

when I press ENTER I get a dialog asking



324

00:14:07.019 --> 00:14:09.089

if I want to update all XML references



325

00:14:09.089 --> 00:14:11.579

and our references job of our field



326

00:14:11.579 --> 00:14:14.249

references now normally announcer yes to



327

00:14:14.249 --> 00:14:17.369

this anywhere the old ID was used it



328

00:14:17.369 --> 00:14:19.110

would be automatically updated with the



329

00:14:19.110 --> 00:14:22.139

new ID now that's pretty cool so why



330

00:14:22.139 --> 00:14:24.809

wouldn't you want to answer yes well if



331

00:14:24.809 --> 00:14:26.610

we had already created the code that



332

00:14:26.610 --> 00:14:28.920

used this layout it would be referring



333

00:14:28.920 --> 00:14:31.019

to buttons with the buttons like button



334

00:14:31.019 --> 00:14:33.869

two or button nine now if you decided to



335

00:14:33.869 --> 00:14:35.850

redesign this layout by deleting all the



336

00:14:35.850 --> 00:14:38.670

buttons and recreating them but Noren



337

00:14:38.670 --> 00:14:41.519

may be assigned to the divide button but



338

00:14:41.519 --> 00:14:42.869

when you rename it you don't want



339

00:14:42.869 --> 00:14:44.519

Android studio updating the references



340

00:14:44.519 --> 00:14:46.740

to button knowing in your code to use a



341

00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:49.499

new button ID button divided so it's a



342

00:14:49.499 --> 00:14:52.319

useful feature but it's also handy to be



343

00:14:52.319 --> 00:14:53.730

able to prevent it from updating



344

00:14:53.730 --> 00:14:56.249

everything now of course I could have



345

00:14:56.249 --> 00:14:58.559

have also avoided any potential problem



346

00:14:58.559 --> 00:15:01.769

by not using names like button 9 I could



347

00:15:01.769 --> 00:15:03.420

I should probably have abbreviated



348

00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:05.910

button - BTN or something like that so



349

00:15:05.910 --> 00:15:07.559

that there was no chance of a conflict



350

00:15:07.559 --> 00:15:10.049

with the default IDs they endured studio



351

00:15:10.049 --> 00:15:12.809

assigns that's worth bearing in - it can



352

00:15:12.809 --> 00:15:15.059

cause you problems so don't start the



353

00:15:15.059 --> 00:15:17.759

idea of a widget with the widget name so



354

00:15:17.759 --> 00:15:20.300

I'm going to answer yes to this dialog



355

00:15:20.300 --> 00:15:22.380

then I'm going to go over to the new



356

00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:26.430

text view we're going to change that the



357

00:15:26.430 --> 00:15:30.080

idea that to operation press into that



358

00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:32.760

now we're almost done at this point and



359

00:15:32.760 --> 00:15:35.010

like the new number edit text widget to



360

00:15:35.010 --> 00:15:36.690

be centered in the layout and the



361

00:15:36.690 --> 00:15:38.730

operation text view to be centered in



362

00:15:38.730 --> 00:15:40.079

the space to its left



363

00:15:40.079 --> 00:15:43.500

once that's done it'll look I'll look at



364

00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.029

moving all the buttons of right so that



365

00:15:45.029 --> 00:15:47.160

they're centered in the layout but first



366

00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.690

you should really deal with those two



367

00:15:48.690 --> 00:15:51.750

text widgets do I say you well that



368

00:15:51.750 --> 00:15:55.019

sounds like a mini challenge all right



369

00:15:55.019 --> 00:15:56.700

so they admit the challenge here is to



370

00:15:56.700 --> 00:15:59.490

change the horizontal size of the new



371

00:15:59.490 --> 00:16:01.529

number widget to rap underscore content



372

00:16:01.529 --> 00:16:03.510

if it isn't already so that you can



373

00:16:03.510 --> 00:16:05.550

expand to store the numbers that are



374

00:16:05.550 --> 00:16:08.130

rented then set constraints to Center it



375

00:16:08.130 --> 00:16:10.620

horizontally in the layout when that's



376

00:16:10.620 --> 00:16:13.410

done Center the operation textview in



377

00:16:13.410 --> 00:16:15.690

the space to the left of new number its



378

00:16:15.690 --> 00:16:17.790

size both horizontally and vertically



379

00:16:17.790 --> 00:16:19.709

should be set to wrap on a scroll



380

00:16:19.709 --> 00:16:21.720

content so that's the challenge I'm



381

00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:23.250

going to end the video here so and see



382

00:16:23.250 --> 00:16:24.779

how you go with that and in the next



383

00:16:24.779 --> 00:16:26.279

video I'll go through and post a



384

00:16:26.279 --> 00:16:30.140

solution see you in the next video
