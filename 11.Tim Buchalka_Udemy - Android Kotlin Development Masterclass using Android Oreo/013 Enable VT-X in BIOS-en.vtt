00:00:04.069 --> 00:00:06.480

In this video I'm going to explain a bit



2

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:09.030

about hardware virtualization and the



3

00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:10.920

various BIOS settings that can disable it.



4

00:00:10.920 --> 00:00:13.139

Now laptop manufacturers in



5

00:00:13.139 --> 00:00:14.790

particular disable hardware



6

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:17.699

virtualization in the machines BIOS so



7

00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.380

enabling it can really speed up the



8

00:00:19.380 --> 00:00:21.869

emulators and they will allow hexam to



9

00:00:21.869 --> 00:00:24.570

run on Windows. So why is this important?



10

00:00:24.570 --> 00:00:27.000

Well the Android virtual devices or



11

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.400

emulators that you'll use to test your



12

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:31.890

apps are on virtual machines so what



13

00:00:31.890 --> 00:00:33.630

that means is that a program is running



14

00:00:33.630 --> 00:00:35.850

on your computer that behaves just like



15

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:37.920

an Android device it's not a real



16

00:00:37.920 --> 00:00:39.629

Android device and it doesn't have the



17

00:00:39.629 --> 00:00:41.280

hardware than an Android device has



18

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:46.059

instead it's all emulated in software



19

00:00:46.059 --> 00:00:48.670

so in Virtual Machines firstly the cloud



20

00:00:48.670 --> 00:00:51.430

is built on virtualization, modern



21

00:00:51.430 --> 00:00:53.769

hardware allows virtual machines to run



22

00:00:53.769 --> 00:00:56.710

on PCs and laptops they can run



23

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:58.120

different operating systems on a single



24

00:00:58.120 --> 00:01:00.850

computer and the virtual machines used



25

00:01:00.850 --> 00:01:03.869

to say use the host computers hardware.



26

00:01:03.869 --> 00:01:06.130

Virtualization technology has really



27

00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:08.440

taken off in the past few years in fact



28

00:01:08.440 --> 00:01:10.990

the cloud is largely built on it one



29

00:01:10.990 --> 00:01:12.399

advantage is when you need a new web



30

00:01:12.399 --> 00:01:15.130

server to meet demand for example using



31

00:01:15.130 --> 00:01:17.110

traditional hardware you have to install



32

00:01:17.110 --> 00:01:18.520

the operating system and all the



33

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:20.710

software that it needs you'd also have



34

00:01:20.710 --> 00:01:22.600

to run network cables to connect it to



35

00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:24.100

the network make sure there are enough



36

00:01:24.100 --> 00:01:26.380

power sockets nearby and there are loads



37

00:01:26.380 --> 00:01:29.760

of other stuff



38

00:01:29.760 --> 00:01:32.520

by running a powerful computer that



39

00:01:32.520 --> 00:01:34.890

hosts virtual servers you can start a



40

00:01:34.890 --> 00:01:36.360

new server up from an image really



41

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:39.120

quickly when demand drops again you can



42

00:01:39.120 --> 00:01:40.560

just shut down and delete the virtual



43

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:43.050

machine. Now virtual machines aren't



44

00:01:43.050 --> 00:01:45.900

actually new, IBM had them in the 1960s



45

00:01:45.900 --> 00:01:47.880

but now that we have far more powerful



46

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:50.580

hardware virtualization has really taken



47

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.490

off another advantage of virtualization



48

00:01:53.490 --> 00:01:55.590

is that you can run different operating



49

00:01:55.590 --> 00:01:58.140

systems on the same computer at the same



50

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:01.410

time. Now this is extremely useful as a



51

00:02:01.410 --> 00:02:03.420

developer because you can make sure your



52

00:02:03.420 --> 00:02:05.670

program behaves correctly on different



53

00:02:05.670 --> 00:02:07.560

operating systems without having to



54

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.190

actually have loads of different computers.



55

00:02:12.190 --> 00:02:14.470

You still don't need a license for each



56

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:16.300

operating system that you want to run in



57

00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:18.700

a VM of course though so as well as my



58

00:02:18.700 --> 00:02:20.230

Mac I actually have a license for



59

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:22.660

Windows and I can start up a virtual



60

00:02:22.660 --> 00:02:23.770

machine running the Windows operating



61

00:02:23.770 --> 00:02:28.690

system right here on my Mac, so here I am



62

00:02:28.690 --> 00:02:32.080

actually running Windows 10 on my Mac so



63

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:33.760

you can see in the background that I've



64

00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.430

got my Mac but in the foreground here in



65

00:02:36.430 --> 00:02:38.170

his window I've actually got a Windows



66

00:02:38.170 --> 00:02:41.830

virtual machine running so for me



67

00:02:41.830 --> 00:02:43.810

OS X on my machine is the host operating



68

00:02:43.810 --> 00:02:46.450

system with Windows running as a guest,



69

00:02:46.450 --> 00:02:48.340

so it's important to remember that



70

00:02:48.340 --> 00:02:50.380

there's only a single set of hardware



71

00:02:50.380 --> 00:02:52.780

here so the windows guest is using the



72

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:55.060

same processor or processors on a



73

00:02:55.060 --> 00:02:58.720

multiprocessor machine as OS X so doing



74

00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:00.700

this on a desktop computer 10 or 15



75

00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:03.640

years ago was possible but was a lot



76

00:03:03.640 --> 00:03:05.500

slower than it is on average desktops



77

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:07.960

these days even start running to



78

00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:09.580

operating systems like this one does



79

00:03:09.580 --> 00:03:11.560

slow things down a little bit more



80

00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:13.210

importantly memory can become an issue



81

00:03:13.210 --> 00:03:16.000

the Machine Hardware still has only got



82

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.830

the same amount of RAM so there has to



83

00:03:17.830 --> 00:03:19.300

be enough RAM installed for both



84

00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:21.459

operating systems to have access to what



85

00:03:21.459 --> 00:03:24.280

they need the 64-bit version of Windows



86

00:03:24.280 --> 00:03:26.410

8 or 10 requires 2 gigabytes of memory



87

00:03:26.410 --> 00:03:28.480

to run minimum and that's just the



88

00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:30.910

operating system requirements so running



89

00:03:30.910 --> 00:03:33.489

say Windows 10 VM is going to need at



90

00:03:33.489 --> 00:03:35.230

least 2 gigabytes of your computer's



91

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:37.270

memory, so on a machine with only 4



92

00:03:37.270 --> 00:03:38.860

gigabytes you can see that things can



93

00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:41.560

and will get a little bit tight just to



94

00:03:41.560 --> 00:03:43.269

show that this is working I can actually



95

00:03:43.269 --> 00:03:45.580

just come up here and I can just open



96

00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:48.130

something on the windows side of things



97

00:03:48.130 --> 00:03:49.810

I can open Notepad which is a Windows



98

00:03:49.810 --> 00:03:53.200

desktop app this is a test and so



99

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:54.519

it's running quite nicely and for all



100

00:03:54.519 --> 00:03:56.620

intent and purposes it actually is a



101

00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:58.900

full Windows installation it's actually



102

00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:01.690

just running the computer and I can go



103

00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.870

down here to about and you can see that



104

00:04:04.870 --> 00:04:06.610

I've got Windows 10 professional edition



105

00:04:06.610 --> 00:04:08.950

here I've got 8 gigabytes of RAM



106

00:04:08.950 --> 00:04:10.959

allocated to this virtual machine and



107

00:04:10.959 --> 00:04:13.209

I'm running a 64-bit edition of Windows 10.



108

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:15.489

The other thing I can do just very



109

00:04:15.489 --> 00:04:17.590

quickly I won't save that change is I



110

00:04:17.590 --> 00:04:18.850

can even put this into full-screen mode



111

00:04:18.850 --> 00:04:20.260

so I'm going to do that briefly and then



112

00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:21.970

we'll swap out of it again just so you



113

00:04:21.970 --> 00:04:24.010

can see what actually happens so I can



114

00:04:24.010 --> 00:04:25.660

come up here to the soft



115

00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:27.550

that is running this virtualization



116

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:29.860

software called parallels on my Mac and



117

00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:31.690

I can change this to fullscreen so let's



118

00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.540

just go have a go and look at that and



119

00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:38.650

you can see that it took a moment to



120

00:04:38.650 --> 00:04:39.940

adjust but now I'm actually running at



121

00:04:39.940 --> 00:04:41.500

full screen and again they've got the



122

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:43.300

same options I had before but I can



123

00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.060

still move my mouse up to the top here



124

00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:47.500

and still get access to the Mac menu and



125

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.000

I can come back here and click on exit



126

00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.830

full screen and finally one other thing



127

00:04:53.830 --> 00:04:56.950

I can do which is where VMs are starting



128

00:04:56.950 --> 00:04:58.450

to blend in with normal operator with



129

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:00.370

other operating systems I can type in my



130

00:05:00.370 --> 00:05:02.440

notepad again and I can come up here to



131

00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.450

parallels and click on view and this



132

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:05.950

time going to go into inter coherence



133

00:05:05.950 --> 00:05:10.150

mode I'll click on yes to that and



134

00:05:10.150 --> 00:05:11.710

coherence mode actually merge sort of



135

00:05:11.710 --> 00:05:13.390

merges the two operating systems in



136

00:05:13.390 --> 00:05:15.610

terms of the interface at least and what



137

00:05:15.610 --> 00:05:18.190

I could then do is over here I've got my



138

00:05:18.190 --> 00:05:20.170

Windows application I've got my window



139

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:23.710

this is a test and I'm actually running



140

00:05:23.710 --> 00:05:25.060

an inner piece that I'm running on on



141

00:05:25.060 --> 00:05:26.710

the Mac and it's not actually in a



142

00:05:26.710 --> 00:05:28.060

separate window and I can actually come



143

00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:30.100

over here get access to the Windows



144

00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.070

Start menu like so and I can run



145

00:05:33.070 --> 00:05:34.270

different apps whatever I want to do



146

00:05:34.270 --> 00:05:38.110

there I could run file explorer and



147

00:05:38.110 --> 00:05:39.250

there's my file explorer and these



148

00:05:39.250 --> 00:05:41.290

windows that can be dragged around so



149

00:05:41.290 --> 00:05:42.790

really getting the best of both worlds



150

00:05:42.790 --> 00:05:44.380

where the two operating systems



151

00:05:44.380 --> 00:05:45.640

even though Windows is running as a



152

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:48.280

separate virtual machine enables me to



153

00:05:48.280 --> 00:05:49.540

sort of merge them I don't have to have



154

00:05:49.540 --> 00:05:51.520

one separate window like I did when I



155

00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.020

went back to this mode so just get out



156

00:05:53.020 --> 00:05:54.610

of that mode to go back to the original



157

00:05:54.610 --> 00:05:56.820

mode that I was in before we started so



158

00:05:56.820 --> 00:05:58.720

that's what it looks like in a window.



159

00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.000

Alright so that's virtualization



160

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.150

running on a Mac, so when as hardware



161

00:06:04.150 --> 00:06:07.420

virtualization come in



162

00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.660

so modern Intel and AMD CPUs have



163

00:06:10.660 --> 00:06:13.200

additional support for virtualization.



164

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:16.510

Now virtualization extensions on Intel



165

00:06:16.510 --> 00:06:20.860

CPUs are called VT-x or VT-x on AMD



166

00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:22.960

CPUs is called amd-v.



167

00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:26.260

now VT x may be disabled in the bios



168

00:06:26.260 --> 00:06:29.890

amd-v is always enabled additional



169

00:06:29.890 --> 00:06:31.930

virtualization support may be provided



170

00:06:31.930 --> 00:06:36.130

by setting such as VT-d, GVT-ds



171

00:06:36.130 --> 00:06:40.210

and IOMMU so enable enable these



172

00:06:40.210 --> 00:06:41.860

settings if you find them in your bios



173

00:06:41.860 --> 00:06:43.930

but make a note of everything you change



174

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.350

just in case you need to put a pack



175

00:06:48.350 --> 00:06:51.350

no hardware virtualization on x86



176

00:06:51.350 --> 00:06:53.690

processors use additional instructions



177

00:06:53.690 --> 00:06:56.180

called virtualization extensions that



178

00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:59.090

are built into the CPU. Now CPUs with



179

00:06:59.090 --> 00:07:00.830

these extensions can run guest operating



180

00:07:00.830 --> 00:07:03.230

systems much more efficiently because



181

00:07:03.230 --> 00:07:05.300

support for the VM is available in



182

00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:07.070

hardware rather than having to be



183

00:07:07.070 --> 00:07:09.650

emulated in software and there is a



184

00:07:09.650 --> 00:07:11.120

wealth of information available with



185

00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:13.280

these various acronyms things like we



186

00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:19.020

talked about on the previous page vtx vtd etc



187

00:07:19.020 --> 00:07:20.820

basically though when you're going to



188

00:07:20.820 --> 00:07:23.310

look at your BIOS if it starts with VT-



189

00:07:23.310 --> 00:07:26.400

or AMD- in your BIOS that enable it



190

00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.620

make a careful note though of everything



191

00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:30.360

you change and if you get any problems



192

00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:32.160

then you can turn it all off again and



193

00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:34.620

re-enable one thing at a time until you



194

00:07:34.620 --> 00:07:36.180

identify the one that caused the



195

00:07:36.180 --> 00:07:39.390

problems amd-v can't be disabled in the



196

00:07:39.390 --> 00:07:41.220

BIOS so if you have an AMD processor



197

00:07:41.220 --> 00:07:43.740

that supports virtualization then it



198

00:07:43.740 --> 00:07:46.380

will already be enabled having said that



199

00:07:46.380 --> 00:07:47.850

there are some other supporting



200

00:07:47.850 --> 00:07:51.180

technologies such as IOMMU or AMD vi



201

00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:53.760

that are worth checking in enabling if



202

00:07:53.760 --> 00:07:57.560

they are disabled even with an AMD CPU.



203

00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:00.360

So enough of the theory, the practical



204

00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:02.610

implications of this are that you may



205

00:08:02.610 --> 00:08:04.200

have a machine that supports hardware



206

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:06.750

virtualization but it may be disabled in



207

00:08:06.750 --> 00:08:09.000

your bios. Now if Android studio



208

00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.130

successfully installed hexam on a



209

00:08:11.130 --> 00:08:13.320

Windows or Mac computer then everything



210

00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.790

setup falling and you don't need to do



211

00:08:14.790 --> 00:08:16.830

anything else but if you've got an error



212

00:08:16.830 --> 00:08:18.870

installing hexam then the rest of this



213

00:08:18.870 --> 00:08:20.670

video should help you to get it working



214

00:08:20.670 --> 00:08:22.620

providing your computer does support



215

00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.260

hardware virtualization of course now



216

00:08:25.260 --> 00:08:26.580

I'm going to start with a note here for



217

00:08:26.580 --> 00:08:29.640

Mac users and if you have a Mac then



218

00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:31.410

virtualization should be enabled if the



219

00:08:31.410 --> 00:08:34.200

hardware supports it and all recent Macs



220

00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:36.870

as far as I'm aware do fully support it



221

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:38.100

and I've never had a problem getting



222

00:08:38.100 --> 00:08:40.680

hexam to run on a variety of a Macs that



223

00:08:40.680 --> 00:08:43.110

I've owned over a period of years so



224

00:08:43.110 --> 00:08:45.210

long as you've got an Intel CPU which as



225

00:08:45.210 --> 00:08:47.250

of the date of this recording or video



226

00:08:47.250 --> 00:08:49.820

all Macs created in probably the last



227

00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:52.080

seven or eight years our until only



228

00:08:52.080 --> 00:08:54.300

you'll be good to go and you should find



229

00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:55.460

it you've had no problem



230

00:08:55.460 --> 00:08:57.600

but if for some reason you've got some



231

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.070

issue and you think VTX should be



232

00:08:59.070 --> 00:09:00.900

available but it isn't then you may



233

00:09:00.900 --> 00:09:02.790

possibly may not have applied the latest



234

00:09:02.790 --> 00:09:05.190

firmware updates check out this page and



235

00:09:05.190 --> 00:09:06.660

the link will be available in the



236

00:09:06.660 --> 00:09:08.040

resources section, so you don't need to



237

00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.140

sort of write it down have a look on



238

00:09:10.140 --> 00:09:11.250

there and that page if there's any



239

00:09:11.250 --> 00:09:13.230

information you need to know if you're



240

00:09:13.230 --> 00:09:14.490

not getting the results you think he



241

00:09:14.490 --> 00:09:17.280

should be getting on a Mac but if you're



242

00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.860

running Windows or Linux and VTX or



243

00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.990

AMD's equivalent amd-v



244

00:09:21.990 --> 00:09:24.120

isn't available then the first thing you



245

00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:25.350

should do is check that your hardware



246

00:09:25.350 --> 00:09:26.640

does actually support it.



247

00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:28.770

So searching online for your computer



248

00:09:28.770 --> 00:09:30.810

model and the text enable hardware



249

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:32.400

virtualization



250

00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.830

provide the information you need. Now for



251

00:09:34.830 --> 00:09:36.870

non-standard or self-build computers



252

00:09:36.870 --> 00:09:38.790

check the manual for your motherboard or



253

00:09:38.790 --> 00:09:40.160

search online for your motherboard



254

00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:42.390

possibly including the you know the



255

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:43.680

model number of the motherboard as well



256

00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.900

which would be quite handy and help you



257

00:09:45.900 --> 00:09:47.730

to find it and also append the words



258

00:09:47.730 --> 00:09:50.820

enable hardware virtualization. Now if



259

00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:52.320

you have a system that should support



260

00:09:52.320 --> 00:09:54.330

virtualization then reboot the computer



261

00:09:54.330 --> 00:09:56.670

and press the relevant key to get into



262

00:09:56.670 --> 00:09:59.280

your BIOS, on many Windows systems this



263

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.310

is the delete button or f2 but your menu



264

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:03.930

should tell you somewhere how to do this.



265

00:10:03.930 --> 00:10:06.000

Now if you don't press the appropriate



266

00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:08.760

key in time the computer will actually



267

00:10:08.760 --> 00:10:10.980

boot into your operating system so



268

00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.240

you'll have to reboot and try again



269

00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.370

some systems may require you to power



270

00:10:14.370 --> 00:10:16.350

off rather than restart so bear that in



271

00:10:16.350 --> 00:10:18.450

mind if you're struggling now it's not



272

00:10:18.450 --> 00:10:20.280

possible to run software to record the



273

00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.260

screen when you in BIOS settings but



274

00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:23.580

even if I could I'd have to swing over



275

00:10:23.580 --> 00:10:26.010

to a Windows machine and show you that



276

00:10:26.010 --> 00:10:27.570

machines BIOS which may still be



277

00:10:27.570 --> 00:10:29.700

completely different to yours so if you



278

00:10:29.700 --> 00:10:31.080

have a manual for your motherboard then



279

00:10:31.080 --> 00:10:32.640

you'll find all the information you need



280

00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:34.530

in there otherwise just make a note of



281

00:10:34.530 --> 00:10:37.050

your BIOS details and reboot so you can



282

00:10:37.050 --> 00:10:39.150

search online for a manual word of



283

00:10:39.150 --> 00:10:41.280

caution here though be very very careful



284

00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:43.980

what you change, if you don't know what



285

00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:46.800

something does then leave it alone as it



286

00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:48.180

could actually damage your hardware if



287

00:10:48.180 --> 00:10:50.210

you make changes to clock settings etc



288

00:10:50.210 --> 00:10:52.440

overclocking for example requires care



289

00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:54.060

so don't be tempted to play around with



290

00:10:54.060 --> 00:10:55.710

those settings unless you really know



291

00:10:55.710 --> 00:10:57.750

what you're doing and the other thing to



292

00:10:57.750 --> 00:10:59.340

keep in mind is you can always exit from



293

00:10:59.340 --> 00:11:01.590

the BIOS settings without saving if you



294

00:11:01.590 --> 00:11:04.410

inadvertently change something also make



295

00:11:04.410 --> 00:11:05.820

a note of every setting that you do



296

00:11:05.820 --> 00:11:08.400

change including what menu it's on so



297

00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.050

that you can undo the change if you



298

00:11:10.050 --> 00:11:12.270

start getting problems afterwards, this



299

00:11:12.270 --> 00:11:13.620

is one of those times where there's no



300

00:11:13.620 --> 00:11:15.630

digital substitute for a pen and a piece



301

00:11:15.630 --> 00:11:17.610

of paper enabling a hardware



302

00:11:17.610 --> 00:11:19.050

virtualization shouldn't cause any



303

00:11:19.050 --> 00:11:20.760

problems but that's there's so many



304

00:11:20.760 --> 00:11:23.160

different systems available I can't



305

00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.570

really tell you exactly what to change



306

00:11:24.570 --> 00:11:26.580

so it's really best to play safe and



307

00:11:26.580 --> 00:11:29.160

keep a record of everything and what I'm



308

00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:30.330

going to do is just put a couple of



309

00:11:30.330 --> 00:11:32.970

links on the screen here now and all



310

00:11:32.970 --> 00:11:34.050

these links will be available in the



311

00:11:34.050 --> 00:11:36.210

resources section this is just giving



312

00:11:36.210 --> 00:11:37.670

you an idea of what some of the yellow



313

00:11:37.670 --> 00:11:39.870

bioses may look like you can see there's



314

00:11:39.870 --> 00:11:42.090

an option on there that's for an award



315

00:11:42.090 --> 00:11:45.100

bias but for the lovano



316

00:11:45.100 --> 00:11:46.960

you'll be able to check these as I



317

00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:49.330

mentioned a letter time that looks a



318

00:11:49.330 --> 00:11:50.380

little bit different so you can see that



319

00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:51.700

menu but this is sort of what the bios



320

00:11:51.700 --> 00:11:54.100

is looking like on various computers the



321

00:11:54.100 --> 00:11:55.200

Phoenix bios



322

00:11:55.200 --> 00:11:57.790

they're just created by different term



323

00:11:57.790 --> 00:11:59.050

manufacturers but essentially do the



324

00:11:59.050 --> 00:12:01.240

same thing by our stands for basic



325

00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:02.770

input/output system in case you're



326

00:12:02.770 --> 00:12:06.220

wondering that's the Phoenix then the



327

00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:11.620

AMD version of the a ufi bias that's



328

00:12:11.620 --> 00:12:12.700

that one there because he has a more



329

00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:14.920

modern version and we're gonna aim the



330

00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:17.710

equivalent as well and noting the Intel



331

00:12:17.710 --> 00:12:19.360

virtualization so we're setting the



332

00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:20.860

enabling the Intel virtualization on



333

00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:21.790

there and looking at some of the other



334

00:12:21.790 --> 00:12:24.010

options, you can't probably see that too



335

00:12:24.010 --> 00:12:24.940

well but there's an option there for



336

00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:27.300

virtualization technology to enable



337

00:12:27.300 --> 00:12:29.830

until virtual technology so we would



338

00:12:29.830 --> 00:12:32.200

enable that and virtualization



339

00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.960

technology enable so we're looking for



340

00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:36.580

something along those lines it's in the



341

00:12:36.580 --> 00:12:39.250

last one the ETD



342

00:12:39.250 --> 00:12:42.610

which is actually on an AMD bios, so once



343

00:12:42.610 --> 00:12:43.870

you've enabled VTX



344

00:12:43.870 --> 00:12:46.780

and other settings such as a MDVI IOMMU



345

00:12:46.780 --> 00:12:49.390

etc you should find after you do that in



346

00:12:49.390 --> 00:12:51.760

reboot back into Windows that you should



347

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.230

be able to install hexam on that machine



348

00:12:53.230 --> 00:12:56.020

and your Linux machine will also run the



349

00:12:56.020 --> 00:12:58.300

emulator as much faster keep in mind



350

00:12:58.300 --> 00:13:00.460

that hexam isn't needed on Linux because



351

00:13:00.460 --> 00:13:02.860

KVM automatically uses hardware



352

00:13:02.860 --> 00:13:05.770

virtualization if it's available now if



353

00:13:05.770 --> 00:13:07.840

it's not available the Lynx machines can



354

00:13:07.840 --> 00:13:10.060

actually still use the x86 emulators



355

00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:12.400

even without it so you can use the



356

00:13:12.400 --> 00:13:14.140

emulators we downloaded in this in the



357

00:13:14.140 --> 00:13:16.180

video on configuring Android studio in



358

00:13:16.180 --> 00:13:18.730

this section of the course on a Windows



359

00:13:18.730 --> 00:13:21.070

or a Mac though you can't run the x86



360

00:13:21.070 --> 00:13:23.830

emulators without hexam so if you can't



361

00:13:23.830 --> 00:13:25.810

enable hardware virtualization to get



362

00:13:25.810 --> 00:13:27.940

hexam working on Windows you have to



363

00:13:27.940 --> 00:13:31.300

actually use the a RM images that I



364

00:13:31.300 --> 00:13:32.920

showed you how to download in the



365

00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:35.320

configure Android SDK video. Now they



366

00:13:35.320 --> 00:13:36.970

should work fine but unfortunately will



367

00:13:36.970 --> 00:13:38.860

be a lot slower than the x86 ones



368

00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:40.960

because the software has to translate



369

00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:43.990

instruction codes for an ARM CPU into



370

00:13:43.990 --> 00:13:46.810

instructions for your x86 CPU before it



371

00:13:46.810 --> 00:13:49.360

can execute them and finally if you



372

00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:50.890

can't get emulators running or that's



373

00:13:50.890 --> 00:13:52.330

running so slowly that you're getting



374

00:13:52.330 --> 00:13:54.640

frustrated remember that you can always



375

00:13:54.640 --> 00:13:56.470

use a physical Android device to test



376

00:13:56.470 --> 00:13:58.240

your programs now obviously you'll only



377

00:13:58.240 --> 00:13:58.990

be able to test



378

00:13:58.990 --> 00:14:00.520

the version of Android that your device



379

00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:02.620

is running but for doing this course a



380

00:14:02.620 --> 00:14:04.120

physical device is fired and you can



381

00:14:04.120 --> 00:14:05.920

manage without running an emulator that



382

00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:08.260

might actually be a better solution if



383

00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:09.550

your computer has only got about four



384

00:14:09.550 --> 00:14:11.320

gigabytes of RAM because you'll have



385

00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:13.810

that issue of Android the image needing



386

00:14:13.810 --> 00:14:15.940

RAM and by the time you're loading



387

00:14:15.940 --> 00:14:18.910

Android studio Java etc you're gonna be



388

00:14:18.910 --> 00:14:20.709

running out of memory so do consider



389

00:14:20.709 --> 00:14:22.300

doing that particularly these days with



390

00:14:22.300 --> 00:14:24.279

Android devices being available so



391

00:14:24.279 --> 00:14:25.810

cheaply that it might actually be a



392

00:14:25.810 --> 00:14:27.339

better option to just grab an Android



393

00:14:27.339 --> 00:14:29.290

physical device rather than messing



394

00:14:29.290 --> 00:14:30.700

around with an emulator if you're having



395

00:14:30.700 --> 00:14:32.830

lots of problems with that.  Alright so



396

00:14:32.830 --> 00:14:34.120

I'm going to finish this video here now.



397

00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:38.070

I'll see you in the next video.
