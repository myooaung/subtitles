1
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,180
all right so in main activity we need to

2
00:00:07,180 --> 00:00:09,370
add the code to use the menu that we

3
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:12,130
created in the previous video now if you

4
00:00:12,130 --> 00:00:14,320
chose the basic activity template when

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,209
creating this project then you'll

6
00:00:16,209 --> 00:00:18,070
already have a stub for the two methods

7
00:00:18,070 --> 00:00:20,260
we need but so we can get Android studio

8
00:00:20,260 --> 00:00:22,630
to generate them for us anyway so what

9
00:00:22,630 --> 00:00:24,460
I'm going to do is I'm going to go back

10
00:00:24,460 --> 00:00:27,010
to our main activity and I'm going to

11
00:00:27,010 --> 00:00:29,620
put the key the cursor after the

12
00:00:29,620 --> 00:00:33,219
oncreate method down here and then I'm

13
00:00:33,219 --> 00:00:37,120
going to do a control oh and the methods

14
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:38,800
that we want here are the uncreate

15
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:41,739
options menu and also the on options

16
00:00:41,739 --> 00:00:43,690
items selected so here the search

17
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:45,339
feature in this dialog is really helpful

18
00:00:45,339 --> 00:00:51,399
so if I type on options menu it finds

19
00:00:51,399 --> 00:00:53,260
matches even if it this actually

20
00:00:53,260 --> 00:00:55,210
represents two different words there's a

21
00:00:55,210 --> 00:00:57,309
few actual entries with an options menu

22
00:00:57,309 --> 00:00:59,139
in their names and the highlighting

23
00:00:59,139 --> 00:01:00,609
makes it very easy to spot the ones we

24
00:01:00,609 --> 00:01:03,039
want so I'm just gonna press the down

25
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:04,809
arrow until you get to the one we want

26
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,310
we've got on create options menu on

27
00:01:06,310 --> 00:01:09,700
options menu on prepare options menu so

28
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,080
on create options menu is the one we

29
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:13,090
want then the other one we want is on

30
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:16,549
options item selected

31
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:18,329
that's this one here so I'm actually

32
00:01:18,329 --> 00:01:20,909
going to come and click that on a Mac

33
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:22,619
and I've got that one selected and I've

34
00:01:22,619 --> 00:01:23,909
also got the other one selected you do a

35
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:26,189
ctrl click and fueler Windows or Linux

36
00:01:26,189 --> 00:01:28,520
clicking ok and we've got our two

37
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:31,109
functions now created or overridden for

38
00:01:31,109 --> 00:01:35,219
us now uncreate options menu that

39
00:01:35,219 --> 00:01:36,689
functions called when it's time to

40
00:01:36,689 --> 00:01:39,119
inflate the activities menu and that

41
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,609
means that which means create the menu

42
00:01:41,609 --> 00:01:44,069
objects from the XML file now we've got

43
00:01:44,069 --> 00:01:45,869
this basics tab now so I need to change

44
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:48,569
it slightly now when we try to inflate a

45
00:01:48,569 --> 00:01:50,700
view in the adapter we have to get an

46
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,039
inflator from the context but an

47
00:01:53,039 --> 00:01:55,140
activity or app compat activity is a

48
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:58,409
context so we can just call get menu

49
00:01:58,409 --> 00:01:58,979
inflator

50
00:01:58,979 --> 00:02:01,500
to get an inflated directly then call it

51
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:03,599
inflate method and give it the resource

52
00:02:03,599 --> 00:02:07,170
ID of the XML file containing the menus

53
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:09,299
XML so let's have a look at doing that

54
00:02:09,299 --> 00:02:11,519
so this is in the oncreate options menu

55
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:14,040
and what I'm going to do here is remove

56
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,459
this super call so the core is going to

57
00:02:17,459 --> 00:02:23,040
be menu inflator dot inflate and then

58
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,269
parentheses are dot menu dot just going

59
00:02:27,269 --> 00:02:30,389
to be feeding score menu comma space and

60
00:02:30,389 --> 00:02:31,980
it's gonna type menu it's the second

61
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:33,930
argument there we're going to return

62
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,340
true now as this is Kotlin we don't have

63
00:02:38,340 --> 00:02:39,959
to use the getters and setters when

64
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:41,639
calling the Java code in the android

65
00:02:41,639 --> 00:02:43,739
framework we can refer to the menu

66
00:02:43,739 --> 00:02:46,109
inflator property directly and use its

67
00:02:46,109 --> 00:02:48,690
or call rather it's inflate method we

68
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:50,400
then have to return true to tell Android

69
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:52,680
that we have inflated a menu and let's

70
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,680
just try this we're going to run the app

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:02:57,599
in the emulator and just confirm that we

72
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:02,310
can actually see the menu

73
00:03:02,310 --> 00:03:04,450
okay then we come over here now and

74
00:03:04,450 --> 00:03:06,040
click on the little were three buttons

75
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:07,990
because see our menu is actually showing

76
00:03:07,990 --> 00:03:10,210
up there now so that's good we've got a

77
00:03:10,210 --> 00:03:14,110
menu in our application alright so back

78
00:03:14,110 --> 00:03:16,750
to the code so creating a display the

79
00:03:16,750 --> 00:03:19,090
menu is really very easy now the menu

80
00:03:19,090 --> 00:03:20,620
doesn't do anything yet we have to write

81
00:03:20,620 --> 00:03:22,450
some code just you know specify what

82
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:24,100
happens when the various items are

83
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:26,500
selected but we're well on the way now

84
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:27,910
you've probably guessed that the place

85
00:03:27,910 --> 00:03:30,430
to specify what the menu items do is

86
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,340
that unselected on options rather items

87
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:35,710
selected function now it's called

88
00:03:35,710 --> 00:03:37,600
whenever an item selected from the

89
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:40,060
options menu now as different options

90
00:03:40,060 --> 00:03:41,440
are selected we're going to be changing

91
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,080
the URL that's used to access the feed

92
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:46,060
so we need to store the URL in a

93
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,500
variable so let's have a look at doing

94
00:03:47,500 --> 00:03:50,080
that okay what I'm going to do is remove

95
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,510
the return call we're gonna start on

96
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:59,560
this with Val feed URL colon string then

97
00:03:59,560 --> 00:04:01,890
I'm gonna type on the next slide when

98
00:04:01,890 --> 00:04:06,730
parentheses item dot item id write

99
00:04:06,730 --> 00:04:10,120
parenthesis and open a code block but as

100
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,290
you can see we're actually getting an

101
00:04:11,290 --> 00:04:13,510
error here so continents objecting

102
00:04:13,510 --> 00:04:15,790
because we're accessing a property of a

103
00:04:15,790 --> 00:04:19,180
nullable type their items passed in as a

104
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:21,460
menu item question mark type so it can

105
00:04:21,460 --> 00:04:23,500
be null now once again it wouldn't

106
00:04:23,500 --> 00:04:25,840
surprise me if google and an at non no

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:28,300
annotation to that so you may well not

108
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:29,890
be getting this error depending on when

109
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:31,840
you're watching this at the moment

110
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:33,730
though we can either use the safe call

111
00:04:33,730 --> 00:04:36,250
operator when accessing item ID or we

112
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:39,070
can modify the function signature now I

113
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,200
previously said that modifying these

114
00:04:41,200 --> 00:04:42,670
functions of signatures isn't something

115
00:04:42,670 --> 00:04:44,260
you should do without a lot of thought

116
00:04:44,260 --> 00:04:46,390
so now I'm suggesting we do it for a

117
00:04:46,390 --> 00:04:48,910
second time how can you be sure or how

118
00:04:48,910 --> 00:04:50,350
can we be sure that it's a safe thing to

119
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:52,990
do here if you go ahead and modify the

120
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,760
function signature so that the item

121
00:04:54,760 --> 00:04:57,070
parameter is of type menu item rather

122
00:04:57,070 --> 00:04:58,750
than the nullable menu item question

123
00:04:58,750 --> 00:05:00,760
mark that's the one with the question

124
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:03,670
mark after it appear then we need to be

125
00:05:03,670 --> 00:05:05,650
absolutely certain that item can never

126
00:05:05,650 --> 00:05:06,340
be null

127
00:05:06,340 --> 00:05:08,470
can we be certain well actually yes we

128
00:05:08,470 --> 00:05:11,320
can this on options item selected

129
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:13,840
functions called when a user selects an

130
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,670
item from the menu you

131
00:05:15,670 --> 00:05:17,500
they've selected the item and there must

132
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:19,600
be an item otherwise they could have

133
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,970
selected it in the first place but but

134
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,040
that said I was saying again don't go

135
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:25,420
changing these override function

136
00:05:25,420 --> 00:05:26,920
signatures without a full understanding

137
00:05:26,920 --> 00:05:29,950
of what's happening behind the scenes if

138
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:31,330
you're not sure then the best thing to

139
00:05:31,330 --> 00:05:33,420
do is call the safe call operator

140
00:05:33,420 --> 00:05:35,410
alright so I'm going to come back up and

141
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:37,090
do that I'm going to put the question

142
00:05:37,090 --> 00:05:38,920
mark after the item down here in the

143
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:42,160
wind call and that actually removes the

144
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,200
error basically cotton is going to

145
00:05:44,200 --> 00:05:46,360
ignore this wind expression if item is

146
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,180
null and that's perfectly acceptable so

147
00:05:49,180 --> 00:05:50,830
if you're working with other framework

148
00:05:50,830 --> 00:05:52,990
functions use the save call operator on

149
00:05:52,990 --> 00:05:55,090
nullable types all right now I'm going

150
00:05:55,090 --> 00:05:57,070
to modify the signature here though so

151
00:05:57,070 --> 00:05:58,330
I'm going to undo that change but I'm

152
00:05:58,330 --> 00:05:59,890
just sort of showing you there was an

153
00:05:59,890 --> 00:06:01,180
alternative to this so I'm going to undo

154
00:06:01,180 --> 00:06:03,130
that change and instead what we're going

155
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:05,080
to do is remove the question mark from

156
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,560
the menu or from the parameters that was

157
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,540
passed to this method we talked about

158
00:06:10,540 --> 00:06:13,090
the reason why they let's spell it all

159
00:06:13,090 --> 00:06:15,220
right so let's fix the error and we can

160
00:06:15,220 --> 00:06:17,470
now add the branches to the win now

161
00:06:17,470 --> 00:06:18,550
let's go ahead and do that so we're

162
00:06:18,550 --> 00:06:20,170
going to go through each menu option and

163
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:24,370
what to do so I'm gonna start here so if

164
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,370
in the wind clause itself win it's gonna

165
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,430
be our dot ID dot we're gonna do menu

166
00:06:30,430 --> 00:06:34,300
free first an error arrow token then the

167
00:06:34,300 --> 00:06:39,120
next slide and put feed URL is equal to

168
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:42,850
now I'm just gonna copy this link okay

169
00:06:42,850 --> 00:06:47,250
I'm going to paste it in there like so

170
00:06:47,250 --> 00:06:50,110
so that's the top ten free applications

171
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:53,740
the next one's gonna be our dot ID dot I

172
00:06:53,740 --> 00:06:58,710
mean you paid no token again feed your o

173
00:06:58,710 --> 00:07:01,420
equals and you can get these links from

174
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:03,720
either the RSS feeds folder

175
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:05,470
alternatively what you can do is just

176
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:07,300
will have a link I have them accessible

177
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,430
as in a text file and the resources

178
00:07:09,430 --> 00:07:11,290
segment for this video and you can do

179
00:07:11,290 --> 00:07:12,160
the same thing there

180
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:13,680
it just forgot that they were there

181
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:16,210
alright so that's for the top ten paid

182
00:07:16,210 --> 00:07:20,220
applications as the last one ID dot a

183
00:07:20,220 --> 00:07:23,710
menu songs or a token and it's going to

184
00:07:23,710 --> 00:07:28,990
be feed URL equals and for that one I'm

185
00:07:28,990 --> 00:07:29,560
going to

186
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,190
the top songs Paris's feed link and

187
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:36,550
paste that in so that's three options

188
00:07:36,550 --> 00:07:38,410
we're going to edit else arrow token and

189
00:07:38,410 --> 00:07:43,510
it's going to be returned super dot on

190
00:07:43,510 --> 00:07:49,230
options item selected item and then

191
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,260
you're going to delete this line and

192
00:07:53,260 --> 00:07:56,260
outside of the win we're going to do a

193
00:07:56,260 --> 00:08:00,639
return super dot on offers item selected

194
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,160
per item

195
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,290
now again with the URLs how I copied

196
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:06,850
them off-screen but you could just go to

197
00:08:06,850 --> 00:08:08,560
the apples website and paste them in the

198
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:09,850
RSS feeds that we've looked at

199
00:08:09,850 --> 00:08:11,800
previously or there's going to be a text

200
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:14,440
file in this video videos resource

201
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:15,790
section that you can just grab them from

202
00:08:15,790 --> 00:08:18,310
there so now that we've done this when a

203
00:08:18,310 --> 00:08:21,430
menu item selected feed URL will hold

204
00:08:21,430 --> 00:08:23,080
the address of the corresponding RSS

205
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:25,690
feed so we can then pass that URL to a

206
00:08:25,690 --> 00:08:27,520
download URL function to download the

207
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:29,380
data I'm going to write that in a moment

208
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:32,020
but first let's just finish off the on

209
00:08:32,020 --> 00:08:35,680
options item selected function so in

210
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:36,700
fact what we're doing here is we're get

211
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:39,460
rid of this return and we're going to

212
00:08:39,460 --> 00:08:42,599
change it to download euro

213
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:47,589
parentheses feed euro and then we're

214
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:49,320
going to return true

215
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:53,320
now this else branch is very important

216
00:08:53,320 --> 00:08:55,180
and you should always include it when

217
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:57,210
creating code to react to menu choices

218
00:08:57,210 --> 00:08:59,350
now at the moment it should never

219
00:08:59,350 --> 00:09:02,290
execute and that's because on the three

220
00:09:02,290 --> 00:09:04,270
lines above we've matched every one of

221
00:09:04,270 --> 00:09:06,010
the weights are the possible entries in

222
00:09:06,010 --> 00:09:08,350
our menu but it's possible to create

223
00:09:08,350 --> 00:09:10,510
submenus though I'm actually going to be

224
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:12,880
doing that soon now when you go into one

225
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:14,890
of those sub menus Android triggers a

226
00:09:14,890 --> 00:09:16,839
call to this method when the submenu is

227
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:19,089
opened if you don't return from the else

228
00:09:19,089 --> 00:09:21,610
branch then any code after the wind will

229
00:09:21,610 --> 00:09:23,770
execute which could cause problems and

230
00:09:23,770 --> 00:09:25,510
here in fact it would call the download

231
00:09:25,510 --> 00:09:27,400
your URL method with an empty string

232
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,339
which isn't very good which isn't good

233
00:09:30,339 --> 00:09:31,690
at all so definitely want to check for

234
00:09:31,690 --> 00:09:33,670
that to have that else branch present

235
00:09:33,670 --> 00:09:36,070
all right so what's this download URL

236
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:38,620
function for well what we're going to do

237
00:09:38,620 --> 00:09:41,470
is once the URL has changed is exactly

238
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:42,579
what we currently do with

239
00:09:42,579 --> 00:09:44,559
on create method we're going to create a

240
00:09:44,559 --> 00:09:46,749
new download data object we're going to

241
00:09:46,749 --> 00:09:48,819
call its execute method with the new URL

242
00:09:48,819 --> 00:09:51,519
and because duplicating code is a bad

243
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:53,649
idea I'm actually going to move those

244
00:09:53,649 --> 00:09:55,600
few lines into their own method and call

245
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,149
that method in oncreate and also here in

246
00:09:58,149 --> 00:10:01,299
the options item selected so let's have

247
00:10:01,299 --> 00:10:03,549
a go at doing that now I'm going to

248
00:10:03,549 --> 00:10:06,220
actually put this above the actually put

249
00:10:06,220 --> 00:10:09,910
it just below the uncreate menu and it's

250
00:10:09,910 --> 00:10:15,329
going to be private fun download URL

251
00:10:15,329 --> 00:10:18,670
parenthesis is gonna be feed URL :

252
00:10:18,670 --> 00:10:23,199
as a string alright so what we're going

253
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:25,689
to do then is actually move these three

254
00:10:25,689 --> 00:10:28,170
lines here out of the oncreate method

255
00:10:28,170 --> 00:10:32,619
the cut those out okay so move them out

256
00:10:32,619 --> 00:10:35,980
of there and paste them into the

257
00:10:35,980 --> 00:10:38,110
download URL method let's change the

258
00:10:38,110 --> 00:10:41,709
text here or the message and we'll go

259
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:48,119
with download URL starting async task

260
00:10:48,119 --> 00:10:53,709
and instead of oncreate done just go

261
00:10:53,709 --> 00:10:59,079
with download year-old and the other

262
00:10:59,079 --> 00:11:00,489
obvious change is to change the

263
00:11:00,489 --> 00:11:04,569
hard-coded parameter here or execute I'm

264
00:11:04,569 --> 00:11:06,160
going to delete that and that there'll

265
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:11,499
be feed URL what our two is before that

266
00:11:11,499 --> 00:11:15,669
I'll undo that change because I need

267
00:11:15,669 --> 00:11:20,649
that string you'll see why shortly then

268
00:11:20,649 --> 00:11:22,149
I'll just go back and delete it again to

269
00:11:22,149 --> 00:11:26,559
put feed URL in there and then back in

270
00:11:26,559 --> 00:11:28,869
here you know uncreate still we still

271
00:11:28,869 --> 00:11:30,069
want to call this function so what I'm

272
00:11:30,069 --> 00:11:32,819
going to do is to a download URL

273
00:11:32,819 --> 00:11:35,769
parenthesis and I'm going to paste that

274
00:11:35,769 --> 00:11:39,519
in there like so so recording that

275
00:11:39,519 --> 00:11:41,739
method there going to add a log DT it's

276
00:11:41,739 --> 00:11:47,390
a log D tag one create them

277
00:11:47,390 --> 00:11:50,690
I think it's a cool effect in the

278
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:53,120
instead of topping it again okay so you

279
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:53,960
can see what we've done there now

280
00:11:53,960 --> 00:11:55,670
they've changed the to logging lines to

281
00:11:55,670 --> 00:11:57,410
log the name of the new method but

282
00:11:57,410 --> 00:11:58,400
otherwise you can see it's pretty much

283
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,710
the same code that we had with the URL

284
00:12:00,710 --> 00:12:03,650
Nell parameterised now if that last bit

285
00:12:03,650 --> 00:12:05,900
looked a little bit too easy to be true

286
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:08,510
well it is we should now be able to

287
00:12:08,510 --> 00:12:09,920
choose one of the three feeds from the

288
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,980
menu so I'm going to try and test that

289
00:12:12,980 --> 00:12:18,710
and see that that works no app running

290
00:12:18,710 --> 00:12:20,850
all right so there's our app running so

291
00:12:20,850 --> 00:12:23,760
so far so good it's working okay what's

292
00:12:23,760 --> 00:12:25,140
not so good though is what happens when

293
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:27,420
I select one of the menu items so I come

294
00:12:27,420 --> 00:12:29,820
up here and you just click on one of

295
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:31,860
them free apps you can see we've got a

296
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:32,760
crashed right away

297
00:12:32,760 --> 00:12:35,520
and the problem is that you can't use an

298
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:37,110
async task more than once

299
00:12:37,110 --> 00:12:40,290
there's no way to restart one they can't

300
00:12:40,290 --> 00:12:42,000
create as many instances as you want but

301
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:44,610
each instance can only be used once and

302
00:12:44,610 --> 00:12:46,230
just to confirm that if we go back to

303
00:12:46,230 --> 00:12:51,810
the log cut and have a look you can see

304
00:12:51,810 --> 00:12:54,510
the error message there cannot execute

305
00:12:54,510 --> 00:12:56,460
tasks the task has already been executed

306
00:12:56,460 --> 00:12:58,710
tasks can only be executed once only

307
00:12:58,710 --> 00:13:01,560
once so fortunately though we can fix

308
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:03,270
this easily by just creating a new

309
00:13:03,270 --> 00:13:05,250
download data instance each time we want

310
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:05,970
to run the task

311
00:13:05,970 --> 00:13:08,820
the only real complication here is that

312
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:10,760
so we need download data to be visible

313
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,020
throughout our activity so that we can

314
00:13:13,020 --> 00:13:14,640
cancel it if necessary in the

315
00:13:14,640 --> 00:13:16,740
undestroyed method what that means is we

316
00:13:16,740 --> 00:13:18,660
can initialize it when we declare it

317
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,100
back up here up here on line 35 now we

318
00:13:23,100 --> 00:13:25,260
have to set it to null here because

319
00:13:25,260 --> 00:13:27,030
variables have to be initialized to

320
00:13:27,030 --> 00:13:29,520
something in Kotlin there's some times

321
00:13:29,520 --> 00:13:31,350
and this is one of them you just can't

322
00:13:31,350 --> 00:13:33,810
avoid using nullable types in Kotlin and

323
00:13:33,810 --> 00:13:35,760
generally that's when you're using java

324
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,640
classes now the async task class was

325
00:13:38,640 --> 00:13:40,860
written in Java world before Kotlin was

326
00:13:40,860 --> 00:13:42,780
created so if you want to be able to

327
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:44,730
cancel out tasks when the activity gets

328
00:13:44,730 --> 00:13:47,250
destroyed we're going to have to use a

329
00:13:47,250 --> 00:13:49,320
nullable type here for that so I'm go

330
00:13:49,320 --> 00:13:51,960
ahead and change that now so private val

331
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:54,870
download data : we're gonna change this

332
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,070
hawk all here let's just delete that

333
00:13:56,070 --> 00:13:58,260
entire reference there so it should

334
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:01,130
they'll be private Val download data :

335
00:14:01,130 --> 00:14:06,260
download data question mark equals no

336
00:14:06,260 --> 00:14:08,310
the other thing that should also be is a

337
00:14:08,310 --> 00:14:11,280
ver now and not a vowel now that we've

338
00:14:11,280 --> 00:14:12,690
done that we can create a new instance

339
00:14:12,690 --> 00:14:15,930
in the download URL function so we come

340
00:14:15,930 --> 00:14:20,900
along here and put download data equals

341
00:14:20,900 --> 00:14:28,640
download data this an XML ListView

342
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:30,810
then the next time we can change there's

343
00:14:30,810 --> 00:14:35,279
a dead load data question mark don't

344
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,490
execute feed URL so whenever we call

345
00:14:38,490 --> 00:14:40,560
functions on our download data instance

346
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,180
we have to use the safe call operator

347
00:14:42,180 --> 00:14:44,130
and that's because it could now be null

348
00:14:44,130 --> 00:14:46,080
so you can see that I've added the safe

349
00:14:46,080 --> 00:14:49,380
call in the download URL on line 48 and

350
00:14:49,380 --> 00:14:51,029
also it need to go down to the

351
00:14:51,029 --> 00:14:52,920
undestroyed function do the same thing

352
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,870
after that as well safe call operator

353
00:14:57,870 --> 00:15:00,870
with the question mark there so as a

354
00:15:00,870 --> 00:15:02,190
general rule we should avoid using

355
00:15:02,190 --> 00:15:04,380
nullable types wherever possible but

356
00:15:04,380 --> 00:15:06,150
sometimes as I mentioned we just have to

357
00:15:06,150 --> 00:15:08,190
use them alright so with those changes

358
00:15:08,190 --> 00:15:11,279
now the code should work then let's just

359
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:18,150
check our app to see that it does so at

360
00:15:18,150 --> 00:15:19,620
the moment we've got the free one

361
00:15:19,620 --> 00:15:22,050
working let's try another paid app or

362
00:15:22,050 --> 00:15:23,370
paid apps I should say you can see we've

363
00:15:23,370 --> 00:15:25,410
got a different set of output there

364
00:15:25,410 --> 00:15:29,970
songs going back to free apps so you can

365
00:15:29,970 --> 00:15:31,980
see that's now working nicely I'm

366
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:33,750
choosing I've chosen different Fiza as

367
00:15:33,750 --> 00:15:35,400
you saw in the app displays the data for

368
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,890
the free apps paid apps and songs now

369
00:15:37,890 --> 00:15:39,720
that's working fine in case you wondered

370
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,070
when I selected songs the songs fate

371
00:15:44,070 --> 00:15:45,990
doesn't have a summary tag but the

372
00:15:45,990 --> 00:15:47,430
program doesn't crash so it doesn't put

373
00:15:47,430 --> 00:15:48,930
any text and it just doesn't put any

374
00:15:48,930 --> 00:15:51,510
text into it so that's how easy it is to

375
00:15:51,510 --> 00:15:53,370
implement and implement a menu in your

376
00:15:53,370 --> 00:15:56,130
apps so I'll stop the video here and in

377
00:15:56,130 --> 00:15:57,870
the next one we'll add options to toggle

378
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:00,570
between in the top 10 and top 25 fades

379
00:16:00,570 --> 00:16:04,310
so see you in the next video
