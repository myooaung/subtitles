1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:05,970
Alright, so we're all ready to start

2
00:00:05,970 --> 00:00:08,250
writing apps for Android but we should

3
00:00:08,250 --> 00:00:10,110
probably start by answering the question

4
00:00:10,110 --> 00:00:12,450
what is Android. Now Android is often

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:14,880
considered to be an operating system but

6
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:17,609
it's also a software stack that consists

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:19,770
of an operating system, Linux and a

8
00:00:19,770 --> 00:00:21,740
framework for developing applications

9
00:00:21,740 --> 00:00:23,880
and it also includes a number of key

10
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:26,340
applications such as contacts that

11
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:29,150
reflect its purpose as a mobile platform.

12
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:31,050
Android was originally written by a

13
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:32,940
company called Android Incorporated and

14
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,030
Google bought that company in 2005 now

15
00:00:36,030 --> 00:00:37,950
its usual to think of Android as being

16
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,050
developed by Google and I tend to talk

17
00:00:40,050 --> 00:00:42,090
about Google a lot in this course but

18
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:44,399
Android is an is in fact maintained by

19
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,340
the Open Handset Alliance so rather than

20
00:00:47,340 --> 00:00:48,989
releasing Android as a proprietary

21
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:50,610
system or their board Android

22
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:52,590
Incorporated Google got together with a

23
00:00:52,590 --> 00:00:54,719
number of other companies to create the

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,840
Open Handset Alliance the OHA there at

25
00:00:57,840 --> 00:00:59,609
the time I'm recording this video the

26
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:02,370
OHA has 84 members who are all committed

27
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:05,519
to keeping Android open source so you

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:06,780
can actually download the complete

29
00:01:06,780 --> 00:01:08,670
source code for Android and modified if

30
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:10,350
you wish there's actually a link to get

31
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:12,330
the source on the home page of the OHA

32
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:14,010
I'm just going to bring that link up on

33
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,460
the screen there again OHA Open Handset

34
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:19,799
Alliance you can see there's an option

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:21,990
there to get the source code there's

36
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:24,409
also a link there to get the SDK as well

37
00:01:24,409 --> 00:01:26,700
now the home page is a little bit

38
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:29,250
misleading because the most recent entry

39
00:01:29,250 --> 00:01:31,079
in the what's new section over here

40
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:34,170
actually has a date of July 18th 2011

41
00:01:34,170 --> 00:01:35,850
and that would give the impression that

42
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,220
not much is happening with the OHA but

43
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:39,750
that couldn't be further from the truth

44
00:01:39,750 --> 00:01:41,759
you're taking this course so you

45
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,770
probably know that version 8 of Android

46
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:48,119
code named Oh was released in 2017 a new

47
00:01:48,119 --> 00:01:49,439
version of Android is actually released

48
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:50,280
every year

49
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:52,649
Android and the OHA are very much alive

50
00:01:52,649 --> 00:01:55,259
now you can learn more about the OHA by

51
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:57,119
clicking on the Alliance menu item at

52
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,530
the top of the page you're clicking on

53
00:02:01,530 --> 00:02:06,180
members as I've done there shows the

54
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,250
current members of the OHA and if you

55
00:02:08,250 --> 00:02:09,599
scroll down if I scroll down you can

56
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,580
probably recognize some of the names of

57
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,380
these companies there

58
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,550
actually part of the OHA and there's

59
00:02:17,550 --> 00:02:18,840
different categories here is what we

60
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:20,340
chose with the default is mobile

61
00:02:20,340 --> 00:02:24,840
operators handset manufacturers some

62
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,260
household names here for sure

63
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,450
the SUSE Tech is one Dell is another for

64
00:02:30,450 --> 00:02:33,240
Jitsu so I'm quite well-known companies

65
00:02:33,240 --> 00:02:36,600
NEC LG and so on now I'm not going to

66
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,220
spend time this video going through it

67
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:42,600
but the Android menu also is well worth

68
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,040
a read to get an overview of the

69
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:46,770
thinking behind Android now I suggest

70
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:48,870
that it might be useful for you if

71
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:51,330
you're on this page to actually watch

72
00:02:51,330 --> 00:02:53,040
this video it's quite a useful video and

73
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,020
I have a bit of a read there all right

74
00:02:55,020 --> 00:02:56,880
so let's have a quick nail at Android to

75
00:02:56,880 --> 00:02:57,990
see some of the things that we're going

76
00:02:57,990 --> 00:02:59,550
to be looking at getting our apps to do

77
00:02:59,550 --> 00:03:01,590
now for this demo we're going to be

78
00:03:01,590 --> 00:03:03,750
using an Android emulator or virtual

79
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:05,550
device and we'll be looking at how to

80
00:03:05,550 --> 00:03:07,680
create virtual devices a bit later in

81
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:09,810
the course but think of them as so

82
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:11,730
basically a way to run our apps on a

83
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:14,130
wide variety of phones without having to

84
00:03:14,130 --> 00:03:15,660
buy loads of devices because it's all

85
00:03:15,660 --> 00:03:18,480
actually done in under a virtual machine

86
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:19,800
which means it's running on your

87
00:03:19,800 --> 00:03:22,080
computer now in fact when Google

88
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:24,660
released Android studio 3 they also

89
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:26,940
updated the emulators now there's also a

90
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:29,070
couple of emulators that include the

91
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,210
Google Play Store

92
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,620
and what that means is that you can

93
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:33,330
install just about any apps from the

94
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:35,730
Play Store onto your emulator and we're

95
00:03:35,730 --> 00:03:36,750
going to be discussing that in more

96
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,370
detail when we come to create our own

97
00:03:38,370 --> 00:03:39,900
emulators but it's something that

98
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,430
developers have been asking for for a

99
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:43,740
quite a few years now alright so going

100
00:03:43,740 --> 00:03:47,130
to switch over now to an emulator you

101
00:03:47,130 --> 00:03:48,780
can see that I've got it running but we

102
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:49,920
can see that it looks like a real

103
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,020
Android phone there at the bottom of

104
00:03:52,020 --> 00:03:54,570
these three soft keys and that you

105
00:03:54,570 --> 00:03:56,160
follow those on just about all Android

106
00:03:56,160 --> 00:03:57,930
devices these days there some

107
00:03:57,930 --> 00:03:59,550
manufacturers do replace the middle

108
00:03:59,550 --> 00:04:01,560
button with a physical key rather than

109
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:03,690
having it on screen but the function is

110
00:04:03,690 --> 00:04:05,970
the same now the triangular button on

111
00:04:05,970 --> 00:04:07,860
the left over here that's the back

112
00:04:07,860 --> 00:04:10,050
button and some devices that appears as

113
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:11,790
a curve to left pointing arrow and

114
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:13,830
rather confusingly can appear on the

115
00:04:13,830 --> 00:04:15,510
right-hand side of the screen instead

116
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:18,840
the back button though is used to go

117
00:04:18,840 --> 00:04:20,370
back to a previous app to Smith's

118
00:04:20,370 --> 00:04:22,860
dialogues cancel menus basically it just

119
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:24,380
goes back to what you were doing before

120
00:04:24,380 --> 00:04:26,670
and just to see what I mean there

121
00:04:26,670 --> 00:04:28,260
HIDA click hard to get into our list of

122
00:04:28,260 --> 00:04:32,880
apps I could choose Gmail then I can

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:35,220
click on the back button to go back to

124
00:04:35,220 --> 00:04:37,680
the list of apps no the middle button

125
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,170
down here that's the home button and as

126
00:04:40,170 --> 00:04:41,850
I said some manufacturers use a physical

127
00:04:41,850 --> 00:04:43,980
button for that instead and this button

128
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:46,320
takes you back to the home screen so if

129
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,850
I run Gmail again and then press the

130
00:04:50,850 --> 00:04:54,120
home button we end up back on the home

131
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:55,800
screen rather than the apps list that we

132
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:58,050
got when we clicked on back now it's got

133
00:04:58,050 --> 00:05:00,570
another function - if your long tap so

134
00:05:00,570 --> 00:05:02,190
hold it down basically it'll just a

135
00:05:02,190 --> 00:05:04,980
Google app you can see that that's come

136
00:05:04,980 --> 00:05:07,230
up there when I've done that now I don't

137
00:05:07,230 --> 00:05:09,120
want to set up the Google assistant at

138
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:10,260
the moment so I'm going to click on back

139
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:12,750
there to get out of that and we're going

140
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:13,890
to need another app running for this

141
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:15,360
next bit so I'm gonna launch Google Maps

142
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,880
as well so I'm just going to go to the

143
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,030
home again click on maps here and open

144
00:05:21,030 --> 00:05:23,640
up Google Maps as well then the square

145
00:05:23,640 --> 00:05:25,800
button on the right over here has

146
00:05:25,800 --> 00:05:27,930
various names so you'll find it referred

147
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:29,700
to as the recents button or the

148
00:05:29,700 --> 00:05:31,830
multitasking button or even sometimes

149
00:05:31,830 --> 00:05:34,770
the intense button now before I tap it

150
00:05:34,770 --> 00:05:36,450
one thing that may not be obvious is

151
00:05:36,450 --> 00:05:39,210
that pressing back or home doesn't close

152
00:05:39,210 --> 00:05:41,220
an Android app in the same sense as

153
00:05:41,220 --> 00:05:43,830
closing a program on your PC the app is

154
00:05:43,830 --> 00:05:45,330
still running and you can bring it back

155
00:05:45,330 --> 00:05:47,190
to the same state it was when you

156
00:05:47,190 --> 00:05:47,910
dismissed it

157
00:05:47,910 --> 00:05:50,340
now the recent button shows all the apps

158
00:05:50,340 --> 00:05:52,380
that are still running and if I click on

159
00:05:52,380 --> 00:05:55,230
that now so you can see here that I've

160
00:05:55,230 --> 00:05:59,040
got maps going as well as Gmail and you

161
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:01,200
can actually close it up completely by

162
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:03,360
clicking on the X up here at the top

163
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:05,040
right but Android will actually tech

164
00:06:05,040 --> 00:06:07,050
take care of closing the older steps for

165
00:06:07,050 --> 00:06:09,090
you if it needs to use the memory for

166
00:06:09,090 --> 00:06:10,320
something else so there's generally no

167
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:12,570
need to do that what I'm doing instead

168
00:06:12,570 --> 00:06:13,860
is tap Google Maps

169
00:06:13,860 --> 00:06:16,110
I want to do that that brings it to the

170
00:06:16,110 --> 00:06:18,360
foreground then you can scroll through

171
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:20,250
the list of recent apps so well to

172
00:06:20,250 --> 00:06:21,870
demonstrate that I need a few more apps

173
00:06:21,870 --> 00:06:23,490
running so we've got a decent list to

174
00:06:23,490 --> 00:06:25,080
scroll through so I'm going to go back

175
00:06:25,080 --> 00:06:26,910
to the home screen using the middle

176
00:06:26,910 --> 00:06:30,600
button and go into apps and we'll start

177
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:35,910
by launching calendar now back will take

178
00:06:35,910 --> 00:06:37,620
me back to the list of apps and this

179
00:06:37,620 --> 00:06:41,060
time we're going to select photos

180
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:43,020
that's a bit boring because I haven't

181
00:06:43,020 --> 00:06:44,910
got any photos of this emulator so I'm

182
00:06:44,910 --> 00:06:47,550
gonna go back one more time now this

183
00:06:47,550 --> 00:06:51,710
time we're gonna start the YouTube app

184
00:06:51,710 --> 00:06:53,880
okay so we've now got a few apps running

185
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,980
and I can view them all by tapping that

186
00:06:55,980 --> 00:06:58,950
- recents button again they're all the

187
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,020
apps of just launched - stacked up with

188
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:02,820
the most recent on the top of the pile

189
00:07:02,820 --> 00:07:04,560
you can see it on the bottom that's

190
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:06,810
YouTube now this is much easier to do on

191
00:07:06,810 --> 00:07:09,270
a physical device using an emulator will

192
00:07:09,270 --> 00:07:10,770
take a little bit of getting used to

193
00:07:10,770 --> 00:07:12,210
because the mouse pointer doesn't quite

194
00:07:12,210 --> 00:07:14,160
behave the same as a finger on a

195
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:16,050
touchscreen and hopefully I won't

196
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:17,550
accidentally touch on that Paul trying

197
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:19,170
to scroll through them but the way to

198
00:07:19,170 --> 00:07:20,430
scroll through them used to hold the

199
00:07:20,430 --> 00:07:22,440
mouse button down while moving the mouse

200
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:25,080
to simulate a finger dragging so if I do

201
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,770
that you can see here that I can

202
00:07:28,770 --> 00:07:31,260
actually move down and change the list

203
00:07:31,260 --> 00:07:34,410
of apps as I scroll down or scroll up

204
00:07:34,410 --> 00:07:39,030
for that matter I'm getting the

205
00:07:39,030 --> 00:07:41,850
different two apps as I do that so

206
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:43,230
basically it's simulating the finger

207
00:07:43,230 --> 00:07:45,450
dragging of the phone's touchscreen now

208
00:07:45,450 --> 00:07:46,830
you saw that when I was dragging the

209
00:07:46,830 --> 00:07:48,360
recent apps to move off the bottom of

210
00:07:48,360 --> 00:07:52,410
the screen to reveal the older ones like

211
00:07:52,410 --> 00:07:54,420
so have a stop down there the less I

212
00:07:54,420 --> 00:07:56,370
scroll up you can see father's is coming

213
00:07:56,370 --> 00:07:59,670
up YouTube and and so on now the Linux

214
00:07:59,670 --> 00:08:02,490
kernel allows multitasking in androids

215
00:08:02,490 --> 00:08:05,250
built on top of the Linux kernel so an

216
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,470
Android phone is a multitasking computer

217
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:09,090
and you can have actually have several

218
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:10,440
apps running at the same time which

219
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:11,970
we're doing here and this can be very

220
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:13,710
useful if you need to do something like

221
00:08:13,710 --> 00:08:15,150
checking your calendar while talking on

222
00:08:15,150 --> 00:08:17,820
the phone for example and in fact we can

223
00:08:17,820 --> 00:08:20,220
simulate that I select Gmail from the

224
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:23,070
list of apps so I was thrown out click

225
00:08:23,070 --> 00:08:26,010
on Gmail and next I'm going to find my

226
00:08:26,010 --> 00:08:28,050
emulator now at the bottom of the side

227
00:08:28,050 --> 00:08:30,720
menu over here is this ellipsis three

228
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,330
dots if I click on that that brings up

229
00:08:33,330 --> 00:08:34,890
an extended controls which I'll just

230
00:08:34,890 --> 00:08:36,330
move over so you can see the screen as

231
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,310
well this the menu lets you play around

232
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:43,350
with things like location and text

233
00:08:43,350 --> 00:08:45,480
messages now the phone option in the

234
00:08:45,480 --> 00:08:49,860
left pane over here I click on that that

235
00:08:49,860 --> 00:08:51,750
allows me to send SMS messages to the

236
00:08:51,750 --> 00:08:53,220
phone and you can also simulate an

237
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:53,850
incoming

238
00:08:53,850 --> 00:08:56,639
phone call using the call phone button

239
00:08:56,639 --> 00:08:58,199
and you can even enter different phone

240
00:08:58,199 --> 00:08:59,970
numbers to build up a phone log which

241
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:01,500
can be useful if you're testing an app

242
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,660
that works with the phone log now on

243
00:09:03,660 --> 00:09:05,880
this nexus emulator that causes a

244
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:07,319
message to drop down so that I can

245
00:09:07,319 --> 00:09:08,670
answer the calls let's just do that

246
00:09:08,670 --> 00:09:12,180
call device you can see that's popped up

247
00:09:12,180 --> 00:09:14,100
there I've come over here now onto the

248
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,340
device I click on answer

249
00:09:18,340 --> 00:09:20,230
now you can't really have a phone

250
00:09:20,230 --> 00:09:22,270
conversation with the emulator but the

251
00:09:22,270 --> 00:09:23,920
emulator is now behaving like a real

252
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:26,170
phone that's in a phone call so without

253
00:09:26,170 --> 00:09:27,520
hanging up the phone I could tap on the

254
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,870
recents button go back to my email and

255
00:09:31,870 --> 00:09:34,240
view that now there isn't much in this

256
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:35,620
email because I'm using a test account

257
00:09:35,620 --> 00:09:37,810
for this demo but it can be useful to

258
00:09:37,810 --> 00:09:39,490
check some details in an email during a

259
00:09:39,490 --> 00:09:41,380
phone call all right so now that I've

260
00:09:41,380 --> 00:09:43,060
checked my email I can tap the recent

261
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:45,400
button again and go back to the phone

262
00:09:45,400 --> 00:09:47,170
call and obviously if that was off the

263
00:09:47,170 --> 00:09:49,270
list we could scroll up and down to find

264
00:09:49,270 --> 00:09:51,910
it and just click it to actually bring

265
00:09:51,910 --> 00:09:53,770
that back on screen again so that's

266
00:09:53,770 --> 00:09:55,390
pretty neat the Android phone that fits

267
00:09:55,390 --> 00:09:57,490
in your pockets more powerful than most

268
00:09:57,490 --> 00:09:59,140
desktop computers from just twenty years

269
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:01,300
ago now there is a slight oddity

270
00:10:01,300 --> 00:10:03,130
sometimes with simulating phone calls on

271
00:10:03,130 --> 00:10:05,320
the emulators at the moment when I tap

272
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:07,060
the red floating action button down here

273
00:10:07,060 --> 00:10:09,880
during the call the extended control

274
00:10:09,880 --> 00:10:12,700
menu sometimes doesn't seem to update it

275
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:13,930
thinks there's still a call in progress

276
00:10:13,930 --> 00:10:16,210
so tapping the button in there will end

277
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:17,710
the call but in this case that has

278
00:10:17,710 --> 00:10:19,750
actually worked okay but if you get a

279
00:10:19,750 --> 00:10:20,950
problem there just tap on the button

280
00:10:20,950 --> 00:10:22,540
over here to end the chords it's not

281
00:10:22,540 --> 00:10:24,280
really a big problem just something to

282
00:10:24,280 --> 00:10:25,570
be aware of when you're testing how your

283
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,520
apps behave with something like a phone

284
00:10:27,520 --> 00:10:30,070
call happens now at the phone app by the

285
00:10:30,070 --> 00:10:32,410
way doesn't appear in the recess of the

286
00:10:32,410 --> 00:10:34,450
staff they win a call so when I tap the

287
00:10:34,450 --> 00:10:37,839
recent button again you can see that

288
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,960
it's actually disappeared there's only

289
00:10:40,960 --> 00:10:42,310
in the apps I had running before the

290
00:10:42,310 --> 00:10:44,620
phone call came in to get back to it we

291
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:47,470
need to contact the home button click on

292
00:10:47,470 --> 00:10:50,350
the blue phone icon here though I

293
00:10:50,350 --> 00:10:51,940
haven't got any favourites saved but the

294
00:10:51,940 --> 00:10:53,770
middle tab this one here with the clock

295
00:10:53,770 --> 00:10:56,950
icon shows the time and duration of the

296
00:10:56,950 --> 00:10:58,570
you know quote-unquote call I just

297
00:10:58,570 --> 00:11:00,580
received and I can even simulate an

298
00:11:00,580 --> 00:11:02,980
outgoing call by tapping the phone icon

299
00:11:02,980 --> 00:11:05,950
on the right over here and that

300
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:07,450
simulates as I said an outgoing phone

301
00:11:07,450 --> 00:11:08,980
call of course they're not really going

302
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:10,390
to make a phone call but it's a great

303
00:11:10,390 --> 00:11:12,690
feature again with testing your apps all

304
00:11:12,690 --> 00:11:14,589
right so I'm going to hang up the phone

305
00:11:14,589 --> 00:11:17,440
let's hang up there Cornell so let's

306
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:20,050
have a look at split screen mode now a

307
00:11:20,050 --> 00:11:21,339
new feature that was introduced in

308
00:11:21,339 --> 00:11:23,680
Android 7 new go is split screen mode

309
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:25,660
the also said don't worry if you haven't

310
00:11:25,660 --> 00:11:28,270
got an Android 7 or later device all the

311
00:11:28,270 --> 00:11:29,920
apps we're developing this course will

312
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:31,779
run on all devices on Android 4

313
00:11:31,779 --> 00:11:34,629
- that's Android jellybean onwards they

314
00:11:34,629 --> 00:11:36,040
would be able to use split screen mode

315
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,290
on earlier devices but it's still useful

316
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:40,540
to see what it is now something about

317
00:11:40,540 --> 00:11:42,879
Samsung devices have had split screen

318
00:11:42,879 --> 00:11:44,949
for a while but it's no part of Android

319
00:11:44,949 --> 00:11:47,199
itself which means that all devices from

320
00:11:47,199 --> 00:11:49,660
moving onwards will be able to use it no

321
00:11:49,660 --> 00:11:51,309
you need to point out already running to

322
00:11:51,309 --> 00:11:53,139
go into split screen mode and I've

323
00:11:53,139 --> 00:11:54,430
already got the phone data on the screen

324
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,579
so we'll use that for this demo now with

325
00:11:57,579 --> 00:11:59,050
that running which it is we got a long

326
00:11:59,050 --> 00:12:02,350
tap over here on the recents button and

327
00:12:02,350 --> 00:12:03,399
again a lot of phone you'd be holding

328
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:04,870
your finger on it in the emulator I'll

329
00:12:04,870 --> 00:12:06,189
just hold the mouse button down until

330
00:12:06,189 --> 00:12:08,139
that happened you know on phones they've

331
00:12:08,139 --> 00:12:09,819
got soft buttons rather than physical

332
00:12:09,819 --> 00:12:12,160
devices the icon changes to show you

333
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:14,019
that you're in split screen so instead

334
00:12:14,019 --> 00:12:17,259
of just a square it shows two boxes

335
00:12:17,259 --> 00:12:18,790
inside the square to represent the two

336
00:12:18,790 --> 00:12:20,170
apps running and that's what you can see

337
00:12:20,170 --> 00:12:22,420
down here now I can scroll through the

338
00:12:22,420 --> 00:12:24,670
list of apps down the bottom now and tap

339
00:12:24,670 --> 00:12:25,899
the one that I want to open in that the

340
00:12:25,899 --> 00:12:29,769
other half of the screen again if it's

341
00:12:29,769 --> 00:12:31,959
come down and select them like so now

342
00:12:31,959 --> 00:12:33,910
some apps can support running in split

343
00:12:33,910 --> 00:12:35,980
screen so you may see a message over

344
00:12:35,980 --> 00:12:38,199
those apps informing you of that but I

345
00:12:38,199 --> 00:12:40,689
can scroll down and select for example

346
00:12:40,689 --> 00:12:43,120
the Gmail click on that and I can have

347
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,069
that and the dollar running together or

348
00:12:45,069 --> 00:12:47,680
the device on screen at the same time so

349
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,779
yeah that's pretty neat and it's also

350
00:12:49,779 --> 00:12:51,579
possible to copy and paste between the

351
00:12:51,579 --> 00:12:53,259
two apps but not all apps actually

352
00:12:53,259 --> 00:12:55,600
support that now the bar in the middle

353
00:12:55,600 --> 00:12:58,209
here looks like it lets you resize the

354
00:12:58,209 --> 00:12:59,889
apps but at the moment anyway it's just

355
00:12:59,889 --> 00:13:01,209
used to close one or the other by

356
00:13:01,209 --> 00:13:02,589
dragging it over the app you want to

357
00:13:02,589 --> 00:13:04,269
remove from the screen so I'm going to

358
00:13:04,269 --> 00:13:06,430
drag it to get rid of the dollar so

359
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:09,610
we're left with just Gmail so we're back

360
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,250
in single view mode so we're now got the

361
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,589
one app running and the recent button is

362
00:13:14,589 --> 00:13:16,179
never changed back to the single square

363
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:18,370
again okay so let's have a look at some

364
00:13:18,370 --> 00:13:19,269
of the things we're going to be learning

365
00:13:19,269 --> 00:13:22,389
how to add you know apps now at the top

366
00:13:22,389 --> 00:13:24,879
of the Gmail app is a toolbar with a

367
00:13:24,879 --> 00:13:26,589
settings menu on the left and a search

368
00:13:26,589 --> 00:13:27,819
button on the right so there's the

369
00:13:27,819 --> 00:13:33,370
settings and there's the search the

370
00:13:33,370 --> 00:13:35,319
settings menu as I click it it produces

371
00:13:35,319 --> 00:13:38,050
a navigation drawer and in this course

372
00:13:38,050 --> 00:13:40,209
we'll see how to create these as well as

373
00:13:40,209 --> 00:13:42,429
implementing search in Oh apps now to

374
00:13:42,429 --> 00:13:44,230
dismiss the navigation drawer to swipe

375
00:13:44,230 --> 00:13:45,220
to the left

376
00:13:45,220 --> 00:13:47,410
now some older phones have a physical

377
00:13:47,410 --> 00:13:49,150
Settings button instead of the settings

378
00:13:49,150 --> 00:13:51,280
3 button icon appearing on the toolbar

379
00:13:51,280 --> 00:13:54,010
it works in the same way just be aware

380
00:13:54,010 --> 00:13:55,210
that if you create an app in the

381
00:13:55,210 --> 00:13:57,280
settings icon doesn't appear on the

382
00:13:57,280 --> 00:13:59,290
toolbar now it's also possible to have a

383
00:13:59,290 --> 00:14:01,720
more traditional menu on the toolbar and

384
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:03,130
we'll be learning how to create menus

385
00:14:03,130 --> 00:14:04,690
before we get into navigation drawers

386
00:14:04,690 --> 00:14:07,060
now the brief instructions at the top of

387
00:14:07,060 --> 00:14:08,770
the lists on 30 may looks like a snack

388
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:11,890
bar this one here these were introduced

389
00:14:11,890 --> 00:14:13,720
with lollipop a material designed but

390
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:15,490
are available now for all Android

391
00:14:15,490 --> 00:14:17,440
versions dating right back to version

392
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:19,840
2.1 and they're similar to the toast

393
00:14:19,840 --> 00:14:21,460
messages that pop up briefly on the

394
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,530
screen but you can also add actions to

395
00:14:23,530 --> 00:14:24,520
them which makes them more interactive

396
00:14:24,520 --> 00:14:27,460
than the old toast messages this one has

397
00:14:27,460 --> 00:14:28,960
just a simple button to close the snack

398
00:14:28,960 --> 00:14:30,850
bar but you can also swap them off the

399
00:14:30,850 --> 00:14:34,510
screen like so now the emails appear in

400
00:14:34,510 --> 00:14:36,220
a list and we can create lists like this

401
00:14:36,220 --> 00:14:38,500
using either the ListView widget or a

402
00:14:38,500 --> 00:14:41,080
more recent replacement quarter recycle

403
00:14:41,080 --> 00:14:43,270
of you know the recycler view is more

404
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:45,760
flexible but you can't tell by looking

405
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:46,990
at the screen which one has been used

406
00:14:46,990 --> 00:14:48,340
here so we're gonna learn how to use

407
00:14:48,340 --> 00:14:50,920
both in our apps anyway and we'll also

408
00:14:50,920 --> 00:14:52,330
see how to use this floating action

409
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:54,790
button this is the circular button at

410
00:14:54,790 --> 00:14:56,440
the bottom right of the screen and that

411
00:14:56,440 --> 00:14:58,030
should be reserved for the primary

412
00:14:58,030 --> 00:14:59,560
function that users would perform from

413
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,140
for any from any particular screen and

414
00:15:02,140 --> 00:15:04,470
here it allows a new email to be entered

415
00:15:04,470 --> 00:15:06,460
now I can scroll through the list of

416
00:15:06,460 --> 00:15:10,780
emails I'll just go back now unless I do

417
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:13,270
that the recyclerview is taking care of

418
00:15:13,270 --> 00:15:15,460
things for us all the lists tree for

419
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:16,600
that matter because again we're not sure

420
00:15:16,600 --> 00:15:18,550
which ones being used here now I can

421
00:15:18,550 --> 00:15:22,510
also tap on an email to read it and

422
00:15:22,510 --> 00:15:24,160
we're gonna learn how to respond to taps

423
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:27,100
and long taps you know apps we can also

424
00:15:27,100 --> 00:15:28,930
add buttons to the list like the star

425
00:15:28,930 --> 00:15:31,000
next to each of these emails under here

426
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:33,670
and that marks them as a favorite now by

427
00:15:33,670 --> 00:15:34,990
the time you finish this course you'll

428
00:15:34,990 --> 00:15:36,190
ever learn how to create all these

429
00:15:36,190 --> 00:15:38,410
effects and a lot more it's just pretty

430
00:15:38,410 --> 00:15:40,570
cool the Android devices can also

431
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:42,670
determine their location and they do

432
00:15:42,670 --> 00:15:45,160
this in two ways the most accurate is by

433
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:47,620
using the built in GPS module if the

434
00:15:47,620 --> 00:15:49,630
device has one then that allows a phone

435
00:15:49,630 --> 00:15:52,240
to be used as a GPS device an app such

436
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:55,060
as copilot or as a good as dedicated GPS

437
00:15:55,060 --> 00:15:56,860
devices for giving directories or

438
00:15:56,860 --> 00:15:59,130
driving in Google Maps also

439
00:15:59,130 --> 00:16:01,710
the advantage of being free and also

440
00:16:01,710 --> 00:16:03,780
makes a pretty good pretty good GPS

441
00:16:03,780 --> 00:16:06,000
navigator though not all the emulators

442
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:07,650
have things like Google Maps installed

443
00:16:07,650 --> 00:16:10,290
and that's why I chose the API 26

444
00:16:10,290 --> 00:16:12,360
emulator at the time I'm recording this

445
00:16:12,360 --> 00:16:14,460
YouTube isn't installed on the API 25

446
00:16:14,460 --> 00:16:16,740
emulators now the other way that Android

447
00:16:16,740 --> 00:16:18,870
devices can check their location is

448
00:16:18,870 --> 00:16:20,970
using the Wi-Fi or mobile phone location

449
00:16:20,970 --> 00:16:24,000
but this is far less accurate Wi-Fi in

450
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,710
particular can be way out because it

451
00:16:25,710 --> 00:16:28,050
only reliably knows the location of your

452
00:16:28,050 --> 00:16:29,460
connection to the Internet

453
00:16:29,460 --> 00:16:31,200
now the phone cabinet in the street in

454
00:16:31,200 --> 00:16:32,670
other words which could be a mile or

455
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:34,980
more from your real location alright so

456
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:38,340
go back to the home screen down and

457
00:16:38,340 --> 00:16:39,690
let's just launch some apps by clicking

458
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:41,850
it over here now the first time you

459
00:16:41,850 --> 00:16:43,650
launch it whether on an emulator or a

460
00:16:43,650 --> 00:16:45,810
real device you have to accept the terms

461
00:16:45,810 --> 00:16:47,970
of conditions but I've done that already

462
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:49,470
and again that's pretty standard for a

463
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:51,980
lot of google apps so alright the

464
00:16:51,980 --> 00:16:54,960
emulators got a default location we can

465
00:16:54,960 --> 00:16:56,730
change that from the extended controls

466
00:16:56,730 --> 00:16:58,140
menu that we just used to make a phone

467
00:16:58,140 --> 00:16:58,530
call

468
00:16:58,530 --> 00:17:00,540
so come over here and click on location

469
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:02,640
and I can tell the emulator that it's in

470
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:03,210
Adelaide

471
00:17:03,210 --> 00:17:05,130
now the longitude let's talk that in

472
00:17:05,130 --> 00:17:06,569
first let's choosing the longitude and

473
00:17:06,569 --> 00:17:09,390
latitude for red light lager T is going

474
00:17:09,390 --> 00:17:11,730
to be one thirty eight thirty eight

475
00:17:11,730 --> 00:17:15,959
point six oh one and the latitude we

476
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:18,030
need to set that to minus thirty four

477
00:17:18,030 --> 00:17:23,750
point nine two eight five tap on send

478
00:17:23,750 --> 00:17:26,760
that sends the new location to the

479
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:29,430
device and it's important to make the

480
00:17:29,430 --> 00:17:31,590
latitude negative it lays south of the

481
00:17:31,590 --> 00:17:33,090
Equator and if we leave it positive we

482
00:17:33,090 --> 00:17:39,200
end up in the sea

483
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,149
and as you can see when I did that it

484
00:17:41,149 --> 00:17:43,039
automatically went to Adelaide when I

485
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,049
actually updated the latitude and

486
00:17:45,049 --> 00:17:47,960
longitude now you can also simulate the

487
00:17:47,960 --> 00:17:49,970
device moving either by typing in and

488
00:17:49,970 --> 00:17:52,369
sending new coordinates or by loading a

489
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,139
set of cord and it's stored in a GPX

490
00:17:54,139 --> 00:17:56,149
file so I'm going to load a file using

491
00:17:56,149 --> 00:18:01,220
the load a GPX XML button down here I'm

492
00:18:01,220 --> 00:18:02,389
going to select the father I've already

493
00:18:02,389 --> 00:18:06,320
got here Adelaide dot GPX and open so

494
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:07,580
once I've done that I've come over here

495
00:18:07,580 --> 00:18:09,590
and click on the play button and want to

496
00:18:09,590 --> 00:18:11,059
do that the corner and it's a sent to

497
00:18:11,059 --> 00:18:12,409
the device just as if we were coming

498
00:18:12,409 --> 00:18:17,059
from a rural GPS module you can see the

499
00:18:17,059 --> 00:18:19,820
Google updates Google Maps is updating

500
00:18:19,820 --> 00:18:23,530
as we do that

501
00:18:23,530 --> 00:18:26,530
and as you can see it also tracks time

502
00:18:26,530 --> 00:18:28,540
as well as locations so the speed varies

503
00:18:28,540 --> 00:18:30,550
just like it would if you got out of a

504
00:18:30,550 --> 00:18:32,980
car and started walking all right so

505
00:18:32,980 --> 00:18:35,820
that's the GPS demonstration and

506
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:37,480
basically that's a quick demonstration

507
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:39,670
of how Android apps work and interact

508
00:18:39,670 --> 00:18:41,850
with the Android operating system

509
00:18:41,850 --> 00:18:44,320
now in the next section so let's start

510
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:46,420
off with a simple app to get the hang of

511
00:18:46,420 --> 00:18:49,240
using Android studio to develop apps and

512
00:18:49,240 --> 00:18:50,770
then we going to build up to create more

513
00:18:50,770 --> 00:18:53,620
complex apps involving databases Google

514
00:18:53,620 --> 00:18:56,440
Maps rest services and more and there's

515
00:18:56,440 --> 00:18:58,870
also a tutorial section coming up and if

516
00:18:58,870 --> 00:19:00,460
you already know Java or Kotlin

517
00:19:00,460 --> 00:19:01,600
depending on which course you're

518
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,460
watching this video in and feel free to

519
00:19:03,460 --> 00:19:05,740
skip those videos but if you're new to

520
00:19:05,740 --> 00:19:07,990
the language the tutorials will actually

521
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:10,090
give you the basics and you'll find the

522
00:19:10,090 --> 00:19:12,670
tutorials in section 4 alright so in the

523
00:19:12,670 --> 00:19:13,900
next video we're going to download it

524
00:19:13,900 --> 00:19:16,990
install Android studio which is the tool

525
00:19:16,990 --> 00:19:18,310
you'll need to start creating your

526
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:20,110
Android apps so we'll see you in that

527
00:19:20,110 --> 00:19:22,620
next video
