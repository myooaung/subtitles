00:07.030 --> 00:09.550
Hope you're enjoying this story and so forth.

00:09.820 --> 00:16.510
And in this video we're going to go on a quick walk through Africa.

00:17.260 --> 00:21.490
So while we're on this walk I also wanted to give you a quick heads up.

00:21.490 --> 00:24.670
You know me very soon is going to ask you to leave early for this course.

00:24.850 --> 00:29.140
Now I know it can be difficult to judge the quality and value of a course this early on.

00:29.320 --> 00:34.420
However the movie system has changed and they are asking you to leave a review earlier and earlier on.

00:34.420 --> 00:38.670
And of course now with that in mind we're not going to ask you to leave a five sorry for this course

00:38.710 --> 00:45.040
but what I would like to ask is if you're not familiar enough with the Course contents to write this

00:45.040 --> 00:48.850
course if of course then please have a look through the tutorials.

00:48.850 --> 00:53.800
Please just scroll down and look at all the different topics all of the different exciting and interesting

00:53.800 --> 01:00.640
case studies with AI that you will cover in this course and hopefully that will give you the confidence

01:00.640 --> 01:02.290
to rate this course a parser course.

01:02.440 --> 01:06.850
If on the other hand something is wrong with the course if you're unsatisfied with something for whatever

01:06.850 --> 01:10.000
reason please let us know before you read the Course.

01:10.000 --> 01:16.390

01:16.780 --> 01:19.640
and we will get back to your feedback is very important to us.

01:19.640 --> 01:21.100

01:21.100 --> 01:26.860
We will fix up whatever the issue is and then get back to you and hopefully that will give you the confidence

01:26.920 --> 01:29.210
to rate this course of Peiser course.

01:29.320 --> 01:32.850
Now on that note if something is wrong please do let us know.

01:32.920 --> 01:38.370
But if you are satisfied with the course if you're excited about the journey ahead if you're enjoying

01:38.380 --> 01:45.640
the trial so far and if you feel that this is indeed a five star course on AI in business then please

01:45.640 --> 01:50.320

01:50.320 --> 01:52.560
they can also learn this.

01:52.840 --> 01:56.450
