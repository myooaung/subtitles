00:00.810 --> 00:07.470
Are right here we go let's do this let's tackle the third case study maximizing the revenues of an online

00:07.470 --> 00:12.390
retail business with the powerful Thompson something algorithm.

00:12.390 --> 00:16.760
So as you can see I prepared already everything but just to show you what I did.

00:16.920 --> 00:23.700
I'm of course in the right working directory folder which is part 3 maximizing the revenues of an online

00:23.700 --> 00:28.830
retail business with Tompson something which belongs to the whole artificial intelligence.

00:28.830 --> 00:30.080
For business father.

00:30.210 --> 00:34.200
So make sure to be in that folder and create this new file.

00:34.210 --> 00:39.540
Thompson something that P Y which will contain the whole implementation then you can give the following

00:39.540 --> 00:45.930
Tyrol's with the first introductory code sections where we'll import the libraries and we'll set all

00:45.930 --> 00:47.000
the parameters.

00:47.220 --> 00:53.010
But as you can see I provided some extra resources which are going to be important for you to implement

00:53.010 --> 00:54.870
this Tompson something algorithm.

00:54.900 --> 00:56.720
So let's have a look at them one by one.

00:56.790 --> 01:02.310
The first one is just a reminder of what a beta distribution looks like.

01:02.310 --> 01:07.860
So here we have three better distributions so you can imagine we have three different strategies.

01:07.860 --> 01:12.380
First beta distribution here a second one here and a third one here.

01:12.390 --> 01:17.700
And remember the most important thing to understand is that the best bet of distribution here is going

01:17.710 --> 01:19.540
to the best strategy.

01:19.650 --> 01:20.690
Is this one.

01:20.760 --> 01:27.060
Because indeed on the x axis we have the return that is basically the rate of successes we have over

01:27.060 --> 01:33.390
many rounds or if you want average number of successes we have over many rounds and I remind that around

01:33.450 --> 01:38.460
it's just a customer connecting to the Web site and then choosing yes or no to subscribe to premium

01:38.460 --> 01:39.210
plan.

01:39.210 --> 01:43.150
If the customer subscribes that success we get one we work.

01:43.290 --> 01:46.250
And if the customer doesn't subscribe that's a failure.

01:46.280 --> 01:47.520
We've got to you where we work.

01:47.730 --> 01:53.790
And so what we have here on the x axis is basically the average number of successes we get over many

01:53.790 --> 01:54.580
rounds.

01:54.580 --> 02:01.560
So that's what we have on the x axis and then on the y axis is the probability of these rates of success

02:01.980 --> 02:09.390
and therefore here that's the density the distribution of all the rates of success is happening here

02:09.720 --> 02:13.780
which are lower than the rates of success is happening here.

02:13.800 --> 02:19.530
And so for example if we take this distribution here well the rates of success is happening here in

02:19.530 --> 02:24.300
this range in the x axis have zero probability to happen here.

02:24.300 --> 02:30.780
So this strategy will never get you any high rates of success whereas this one well you know the rates

02:30.780 --> 02:36.300
of success is happening here are pretty high and they happen with a positive probability.

02:36.300 --> 02:43.200
So first of all this rate of success here will happen with let's say 0.03 probability than this one

02:43.200 --> 02:43.650
here.

02:43.740 --> 02:50.040
This higher rate of success will happen with a much larger probability like 0.15 And then this one here

02:50.040 --> 02:50.730
is the best one.

02:50.730 --> 02:57.900
The rate of success happening with let's say a 0.2 probability and then of course the very high rates

02:57.900 --> 03:03.260
of success this year have zero probability of happening with neither of the three strategies.

03:03.270 --> 03:08.230
So that's what you have to understand will have a beta distribution for each of our nine strategies.

03:08.250 --> 03:13.980
Here we have three strategies but we'll have nine beta distributions and we'll try to find the one that

03:14.100 --> 03:19.980
of course is the most on the right because the one the most on the right is the one that has the highest

03:20.250 --> 03:24.300
rates of conversion of which the probabilities are positive.

03:24.310 --> 03:26.890
You know strictly positive.

03:27.090 --> 03:29.230
So there you go please keep that in mind.

03:29.280 --> 03:34.620
It's important to understand well the beta distribution and now let's have a look at the other slides

03:34.620 --> 03:35.760
that I provided.

03:35.760 --> 03:40.530
So this is going to be the simulation that we'll do because we'll make the simulation ourself which

03:40.530 --> 03:44.960
is exactly what we did in both the first case and the second case study.

03:45.090 --> 03:52.980
And so we'll make a simulation with the following conversion rates for each of the nine strategies.

03:52.980 --> 03:58.960
And so as we can see that's important to understand as we can see one of these strategies is the best.

03:59.070 --> 04:04.620
And of course it is the one with the highest conversion rate and the highest conversion rate here is

04:04.830 --> 04:08.470
this one 0.20 that's a great conversion rate.

04:08.490 --> 04:14.100
You know this big online retail company would be super happy to find a strategy that has this conversion

04:14.100 --> 04:19.800
rate because that means it would convert 20 percent of its millions and millions of customers to the

04:19.800 --> 04:20.770
premium plan.

04:20.800 --> 04:22.610
So that would be a huge win for them.

04:22.800 --> 04:25.140
But it has to find the strategy.

04:25.260 --> 04:29.800
And I remind that this is only a simulation at the beginning of the experiment.

04:29.940 --> 04:34.640
Well Thompson simply has no idea of these conversion rates here.

04:34.710 --> 04:37.840
We only know them now because we're doing the simulation.

04:37.950 --> 04:42.420
But of course at the beginning we will have no idea and no worries.

04:42.420 --> 04:47.210
Thompson something will figure it out and you will see how efficiently it figures it out.

04:47.520 --> 04:48.360
But there we go.

04:48.420 --> 04:51.450
That's the simulation we have our nine strategies here.

04:51.450 --> 04:56.340
Each of them has a different conversion rate pretty low for each of them that's normal.

04:56.340 --> 05:00.790
You know it's hard to convert customers but there is this best one that we're to find.

05:00.860 --> 05:05.360
And of course in the end when we go into production well we'll compute some returns we'll plot them

05:05.390 --> 05:11.510
histograms of selection's we'll see clearly which strategy was selected the most and also we'll have

05:11.510 --> 05:17.510
a look at the list of our selections and we'll check in how many rounds the Tompson something algorithm

05:17.510 --> 05:22.480
was able to identify this best with the best conversion rate.

05:22.490 --> 05:22.940
All right.

05:22.940 --> 05:24.360
So that's the simulation.

05:24.530 --> 05:28.430
And now let's move on to the next resource that I provided.

05:28.430 --> 05:30.770
So here again you already saw this one.

05:30.770 --> 05:38.270
These are our nine strategies composed of several elements of form a package an ad and a special deal.

05:38.270 --> 05:45.020
Each of these nine strategies have the same cost of deployment so the cost have to be saved not intrinsically

05:45.110 --> 05:52.220
and the strategies themselves but on the number of rounds that it will take to identify the best strategy

05:52.700 --> 05:57.990
which we know because we are on the other side of the simulation is strategy number seven.

05:58.000 --> 05:58.340
All right.

05:58.340 --> 06:00.640
Because it has the highest conversion rate.

06:00.950 --> 06:08.060
So not only it will minimize it cause but also again it will tremendously maximize the revenues of this

06:08.060 --> 06:13.370
online retail business because you will have hundreds of thousands or maybe millions of customers subscribing

06:13.370 --> 06:17.760
to the premium plan therefore generating a whole lot more revenues.

06:17.870 --> 06:19.830
All right so let's close this.

06:19.880 --> 06:28.080
And then finally of course I provided the whole Thompson sampling algorithm which we will implement

06:28.230 --> 06:34.650
exactly as it is given here that is we're going to repeat a certain number of times which will be for

06:34.650 --> 06:39.700
starters 10000 times but then you'll see we'll even try with 1000 times.

06:39.700 --> 06:41.270
Well these are numbers of rounds.

06:41.310 --> 06:43.750
We'll repeat the following three steps.

06:43.950 --> 06:49.950
Step 1 we take a random drop and the following distribution with these two parameters and we do that

06:49.950 --> 06:52.470
for each of our nine strategies.

06:52.470 --> 06:56.800
Then step 2 we select know that the action happening here.

06:56.880 --> 07:05.110
We select the strategy that has the highest value of these nine values drawn here from this beta distribution

07:05.770 --> 07:13.050
and in step 3 we'll update these two numbers so this number is the number of times the strategy has

07:13.050 --> 07:20.290
received a one word up to around and and this number here is the number of times the strategy has received

07:20.370 --> 07:22.650
zero reward up to round.

07:22.940 --> 07:28.950
And so if the strategy selected receive the one word will increment this one by one and if the strategy

07:28.950 --> 07:33.370
selected received zero we were that is that the customer didn't subscribe to the premium plan.

07:33.510 --> 07:35.870
Well of course we'll increment this one by one.

07:35.880 --> 07:36.840
All right.

07:36.930 --> 07:43.830
So Bruce simple resemble three steps but very very efficient and powerful you'll see will first start

07:43.830 --> 07:45.520
with 10000 rounds.

07:45.690 --> 07:52.280
You know just to make sure it can identify easily the best strategy which is strategy number seven and

07:52.280 --> 07:56.880
then we'll try with 1000 rounds to see if it can identify it as well.

07:56.880 --> 07:57.870
All right.

07:57.870 --> 07:59.210
So that's close.

07:59.310 --> 08:03.030
And now I guess we're ready we are ready to start our implementation.
