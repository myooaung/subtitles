Hello and welcome back to case study number one.

00:03.420 --> 00:09.180
Optimizing wherehouse flows with Q learning and this tutorial we're going to discuss the plan of attack

00:09.300 --> 00:13.680
for this case study which is the following.

00:13.740 --> 00:19.860
So it's a plan of attack in three parts in the first part will define the environment and defining the

00:19.860 --> 00:20.680
environment.

00:20.730 --> 00:25.040
When doing artificial intelligence is always the same three steps process.

00:25.050 --> 00:27.260
First we define the state.

00:27.300 --> 00:29.470
Second we define the actions.

00:29.700 --> 00:32.240
And third we define what we want.

00:32.550 --> 00:38.070
And then in the second part of this plan of attack will study the solution and actually we'll do that

00:38.070 --> 00:41.680
with Karylle with his super intuition lectures.

00:41.850 --> 00:46.830
And so you will not only see the intuition but also the theory that is all the mathematical details

00:46.830 --> 00:48.630
behind jewelry.

00:48.900 --> 00:53.980
And so first you'll be introduced to mark of decision processes which are at the heart of key learning.

00:54.000 --> 00:59.190
So you have to understand them first then you'll be introduced to the temporal difference which is a

00:59.190 --> 01:05.670
fundamental part of the learning algorithm and eventually you'll know and you'll understand the whole

01:06.180 --> 01:09.240
learning process as a whole new learning algorithm.

01:09.660 --> 01:16.950
And then in part three to solve our case then we will implement the whole learning model in Python to

01:16.950 --> 01:20.300
solve this case study optimizing the warehouse flows.

01:20.460 --> 01:24.110
And once we have this solution we'll go into production.

01:24.180 --> 01:31.680
Like in a real world business problem and eventually we will improve this solution by adding this feature

01:31.680 --> 01:38.070
which allows the arms warehouse robot to go by some intermediary point that are part of the top three

01:38.070 --> 01:42.840
priority locations to where it has to go in order to optimize even more.

01:42.840 --> 01:49.140
The warehouse looks all right so if you're ready in the next to you let's tackle the first part.

01:49.140 --> 01:50.640
Defining the environment.
