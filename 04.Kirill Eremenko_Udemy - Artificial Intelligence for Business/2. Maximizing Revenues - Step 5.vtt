00:01.040 --> 00:05.110
Do these first introductory code sections quickly and efficiently.

00:05.310 --> 00:10.050
So first we have to import the libraries and again that's going to be simple we're going to use Of course

00:10.610 --> 00:17.100
by as always because we're going to work with arrays because these we'll create a simulation that will

00:17.100 --> 00:24.630
be an array of 10000 lines each line corresponding to around and nine columns each column corresponding

00:24.630 --> 00:26.440
to one of the nine strategies.

00:26.520 --> 00:32.490
So you know strategy 1 will be on Column 1 strategy 2 will be on can to and etc. to strategy none will

00:32.490 --> 00:33.560
be on 9.

00:33.810 --> 00:39.000
And of course the cells have this huge array will contain either zeros or ones and we'll get to zero

00:39.030 --> 00:44.860
if the strategy is selected at the corresponding round then lead to a conversion and a 1 if the strategy

00:44.860 --> 00:48.440
is selected at the corresponding one lead to a conversion.

00:48.480 --> 00:54.680
So we'll actually use non-Thai And let's not forget the practical shortcut.

00:55.230 --> 01:01.340
And then we will also import is matplotlib because we'll make some visualizations in the end will plot

01:01.350 --> 01:04.920
the histogram of the selections and there is going to be something more.

01:04.980 --> 01:10.450
But I don't want to say what it is now because it will be part of the homework but anyway we'll needed

01:10.590 --> 01:17.130
to import that Matt lot lib matplotlib that by blood.

01:17.270 --> 01:21.050
And again we're going to use the shortcut fields.

01:21.290 --> 01:21.770
All right.

01:21.770 --> 01:22.610
Perfect.

01:22.610 --> 01:23.480
And that's it.

01:23.480 --> 01:25.750
That's the only two libraries we have to import.

01:26.000 --> 01:29.070
And so now let's set the parameters.

01:29.090 --> 01:33.400
So again this is going to be simple we only have two parameters to set.

01:33.410 --> 01:39.980
This is going to be first the total number of rounds that will make the experiment.

01:39.980 --> 01:46.850
That is the total number of customers connecting one by one you know one after the other to this online

01:46.850 --> 01:48.280
retail business web site.

01:48.460 --> 01:54.260
And so that makes around and you know the whole round is this process of trying to convert this customer

01:54.260 --> 02:01.550
to subscribe to premium plan with either a pop up happening or an ad or an ad happening in email or

02:01.550 --> 02:01.940
whatever.

02:01.940 --> 02:06.830
You know there are many marketing techniques today that you can use to try to convert your customer

02:07.130 --> 02:11.680
into anything subscription to buy something or any conversion.

02:11.690 --> 02:17.330
And so number end here is going to be the total number of rounds that is the total number of customers

02:17.690 --> 02:20.790
that we try to convert one after the other.

02:20.840 --> 02:26.720
And for starters this is going to be ten thousand right 10000.

02:26.810 --> 02:32.090
We're going to have 10000 rounds at first just to make sure you know our terms and something algorithm

02:32.090 --> 02:39.830
can identify the best strategy and then the second parameter is going to be D which as you can guess

02:40.160 --> 02:42.620
is just going to be the number of strategies.

02:42.620 --> 02:48.350
And I put that as a parameter because you know you might want to experiment with more strategies or

02:48.440 --> 02:49.700
less strategies.

02:49.880 --> 02:56.450
And I encourage you to run many more simulations you know we'll run one simulation with the following

02:57.080 --> 02:58.040
conversion rates.

02:58.100 --> 03:04.610
But feel free to you know play with other conversion rates for example you can give some much lower

03:04.610 --> 03:05.510
conversion rates.

03:05.510 --> 03:11.450
Each of them with a much smaller difference between the conversion rate of the best strategy and the

03:11.450 --> 03:17.240
other conversion rates because here we have a difference of 0.04 between the best strategy and the second

03:17.240 --> 03:22.760
best reges so it would not be that difficult for Thompson simply to identify the best one and therefore

03:22.760 --> 03:23.570
to give more challenge.

03:23.570 --> 03:30.270
Well what you can do is for example leave that to 0.20 and replace that or point nineteen.

03:30.470 --> 03:36.890
And then again you can put that at 0.18 that there are some other simulations that you can run and therefore

03:37.640 --> 03:44.360
let's add this parameter here in case you want to experiment with less or more strategies and that's

03:44.360 --> 03:44.840
it.

03:44.870 --> 03:50.220
Now we're ready to start the next section which will be about creating the simulation.

03:50.420 --> 03:55.230
So this will take a couple of time you know a couple of minutes so we'll do that in next tutorial.

03:55.250 --> 03:58.370
You know what to Bill already I told you about the array we're building.

03:58.370 --> 04:04.190
So if you want you can try but there is going to be a trick we're going to use which has to do with

04:04.340 --> 04:07.450
I'm going to give you a hint the Bernoulli distribution.

04:07.520 --> 04:09.490
So let's check it out in the next tutorial.

04:09.510 --> 04:11.200
And until then enjoy AI.
