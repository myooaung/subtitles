00:00.450 --> 00:07.370
Are right congratulations again for having implemented the random strategy and Knowsley Thompson Semlin.

00:07.440 --> 00:13.170
Now we're going to put that all in production and to do so well of course we're going to test the two

00:13.260 --> 00:17.250
algorithms here and see which one performs the best.

00:17.280 --> 00:22.320
Of course we know that it is going to be Tompson sampling but we would like to see by how much.

00:22.320 --> 00:25.650
Thompson sampling is going to beat the random strategy.

00:25.980 --> 00:31.680
So here we go and to test that we are going to compute the absolute and relative return.

00:31.680 --> 00:39.510
So let me show you on investor PALEA what is exactly the absolute and relative return so relative return

00:39.570 --> 00:44.450
is the return an asset achieves over a period of time compared to benchmark.

00:44.460 --> 00:51.980
And so in our situation the benchmark is of course the Ranum strategy and the asset is of course Tompson

00:51.990 --> 00:58.380
sampling and so we're going to see how better our Thompson something asset achieves over a period of

00:58.380 --> 01:04.370
time which is our 10000 rounds compared to the benchmark which is around strategy.

01:04.470 --> 01:08.880
And then I say the relative return is the difference between the assets return and the return of the

01:08.880 --> 01:09.720
benchmark.

01:09.840 --> 01:15.510
But in our case we're going to call that difference the absolute return like what we do in physics you

01:15.510 --> 01:16.140
know.

01:16.140 --> 01:18.500
So we're going to call the absolute return.

01:18.570 --> 01:24.650
The difference between the Tomsen something performance and the Ranum strategy performance.

01:24.840 --> 01:30.990
And then we also compute the relative return in our terms which will be by what percentage or more.

01:30.990 --> 01:34.710
Thompson something outperforms the random strategy.

01:34.710 --> 01:36.420
All right let's do this.

01:36.420 --> 01:37.860
Just wanted to show you this.

01:38.040 --> 01:41.090
So that what we compute is clear for everybody.

01:41.310 --> 01:49.380
So let's start with the absolute return in our terms which as we just said is going to be the difference

01:49.650 --> 02:00.810
between the total reward accumulated by Tompson something you know our asset minus the total reward

02:01.470 --> 02:05.640
of the Ranum strategy and that's the absolute return.

02:05.670 --> 02:06.860
Simply the difference.

02:07.090 --> 02:08.970
But I want to do something fun.

02:09.240 --> 02:15.840
You know here we'll only get the difference of the accumulated once you know the some of the ones accumulated

02:15.840 --> 02:22.950
by Tompson sampling minus some of the ones I completed by the Ranum strategy because we could do something

02:22.950 --> 02:23.850
more fun.

02:23.850 --> 02:30.990
Keep in mind that one actually means that we have a conversion by customer you know the customer subscribes

02:31.260 --> 02:32.470
to the premium plan.

02:32.610 --> 02:37.780
And so let's say that the premium plan is $100 per year.

02:37.800 --> 02:44.410
You know the customer if he or she wants to subscribe to premium plan well he or she has to pay $100

02:44.550 --> 02:49.870
per year so that the absolute return that we compute is going to be.

02:50.080 --> 02:58.980
Well this difference multiplied by 100 because indeed this is exactly what the online retail business

02:59.270 --> 03:04.790
will make an extra revenues by using Tompson sampling compared to the rended strategy.

03:05.160 --> 03:11.940
So this result here will be exactly the amount in dollars that this online retail business will win.

03:11.940 --> 03:13.700
Thanks to Tompson sampling.

03:13.710 --> 03:14.280
All right.

03:14.550 --> 03:16.320
So that's the first thing we compute.

03:16.320 --> 03:25.350
And then now let's compute the relative return which is just a seed by which percentage the Thomson

03:25.350 --> 03:29.310
sampling algorithm here outperforms the Ranum strategy.

03:29.490 --> 03:37.680
So relative return which is going to be well we can take that again actually say that again the difference

03:37.680 --> 03:44.190
between the toll we were accumulated by the Tompson sampling algorithm and the toll we were accumulated

03:44.190 --> 03:51.810
by the random strategy divided by Therefore the total reward accumulated by the Rand strategy because

03:51.810 --> 03:58.600
we want to see how we do better compared to the Ranum strategy which is our benchmark.

03:58.950 --> 04:05.180
And then we can again multiply by 100 because indeed we want to get a percentage.

04:05.360 --> 04:05.870
Okay.

04:05.940 --> 04:07.540
To get the percentage.

04:07.650 --> 04:10.010
We have to multiply by 100.

04:10.020 --> 04:17.160
All right perfect so we get this and now we're going to do some nice prints to print one print to print

04:17.160 --> 04:18.380
the absolute return.

04:18.460 --> 04:21.710
And one of the print print the relative returns so here we go.

04:21.900 --> 04:26.110
Let's start with the first Brant first print we're going to print.

04:26.150 --> 04:35.540
So we have to put in quotes the absolute return and now we're going to use this nice format trick which

04:35.540 --> 04:38.070
is a new feature by Biden 3.6.

04:38.080 --> 04:42.900
Make sure you have Biden 3.6 and inside his brackets here.

04:42.920 --> 04:48.280
I'm going to put a call in then at that and then zero.

04:48.680 --> 04:54.390
And that means that I want to get the absolute return as a float of zero decimals.

04:54.410 --> 05:00.980
That is as an integer as a rounded integer and anyway you know this result here of this formulation

05:00.980 --> 05:07.130
of the second edition is correct in integer but it's just that you have to know the trick to get the

05:07.130 --> 05:08.870
format you want.

05:08.870 --> 05:16.040
And then here inside the string I'm just going to add a dollar to say that indeed the business is making

05:16.040 --> 05:18.070
that much more money in dollars.

05:18.080 --> 05:24.200
But of course if you're for example from Europe you can put euros or if you were from another country

05:24.200 --> 05:27.520
well you can put your currency is just for fun which we're doing here.

05:27.980 --> 05:34.070
And then this format trick has to be implemented this way after this string that you put in that will

05:34.070 --> 05:42.110
quote you need add that format and then very simply because format is function inside this format function

05:42.110 --> 05:46.620
in parenthesis you just need to input what is going to be here.

05:46.650 --> 05:48.540
No that is absolute return.

05:48.620 --> 05:55.120
And that's why here I'm adding the variable that will give us exactly this absolute return.

05:55.130 --> 05:57.770
All right perfect so our printer is ready.

05:57.840 --> 06:02.820
And now let's print the relative return this time in the second print.

06:03.020 --> 06:10.010
So that's why I just copy pasted because this is going to be exactly the same we just have to basically

06:10.070 --> 06:12.810
replace absolute relative here.

06:12.860 --> 06:15.420
As I just did and here as well.

06:15.560 --> 06:19.000
So relative return.

06:19.040 --> 06:19.790
And here we go.

06:19.790 --> 06:26.830
Our prints are red and I suggest that we already see what is the absolute and relative return.

06:26.840 --> 06:32.960
And by the way let's not forget also to replace this dollar by a percent because the relative return

06:33.020 --> 06:40.320
is a percentage you know it's by which percentage the Thompsons and the algorithm outperforms the random.
