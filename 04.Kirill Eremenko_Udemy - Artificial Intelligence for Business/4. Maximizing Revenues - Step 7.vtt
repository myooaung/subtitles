WEBVTT

00:00.120 --> 00:00.390
All right.

00:00.390 --> 00:06.270
So as we just said that's where the new distribution comes into play because indeed we have the conversion

00:06.270 --> 00:09.180
rates for each of our nine strategies.

00:09.180 --> 00:15.830
And right now we're dealing inside this second full loop with a specific strategy in the specific round.

00:15.870 --> 00:23.270
So let's say for example that we're dealing with this strategy here that has a conversion rate of 16.

00:23.520 --> 00:31.080
Well the trick to simulate whether we're going to get a zero or a one is by taking a random draw from

00:31.080 --> 00:36.980
the Vernou the distribution of parameter 0.16 Daury for those of you who didn't get that.

00:37.020 --> 00:38.190
I'm going to explain.

00:38.490 --> 00:40.770
So in fact it's really simple.

00:40.770 --> 00:48.900
This strategy has a conversion rate of 0.16 meaning that there is 16 percent chance which is very high

00:48.910 --> 00:54.510
by the way that the customer we're dealing with right now subscribes to premium plan.

00:54.510 --> 01:00.630
So the question is how can we simulate the fact that we're going to get a zero or one considering that

01:00.630 --> 01:04.250
we have 16 percent chance of getting a 1.

01:04.560 --> 01:05.620
Well that's easy.

01:05.640 --> 01:12.090
The trick to do that and we already did it in case number two is to simply take a random number between

01:12.090 --> 01:14.100
0 or 1.

01:14.100 --> 01:20.400
Then remember we have to understand that naturally and mathematically this random number that we picked

01:20.460 --> 01:28.160
that is that we took randomly from 0 to 1 has a 16 percent chance of being lower than 0.16.

01:28.200 --> 01:35.610
You know it has 16 percent chance of being lower than 0.16 and it has 84 percent chance of being larger

01:35.610 --> 01:41.140
than 0.16 because this number was taken from a uniform distribution.

01:41.430 --> 01:48.430
So therefore since this number we picked has a 16 percent chance of being lower than 0.16.

01:48.630 --> 01:55.530
And the strategy we selected has also 16 percent chance of converting the user to subscribe to the premium

01:55.530 --> 01:56.050
plan.

01:56.190 --> 02:01.650
Well the way we can simulate this conversion is by giving a one to that specific cell we're dealing

02:01.650 --> 02:02.390
right now.

02:02.400 --> 02:04.010
That is the cell I j.

02:04.230 --> 02:13.710
If and only if the random number we picked from 0 to 1 is lower than 0.16 because again this random

02:13.710 --> 02:21.420
number has 16 percent chance of being lower than 0.16 just as the strategy that has 16 percent chance

02:21.780 --> 02:23.460
of converting this customer.

02:23.490 --> 02:27.800
I too subscribe to the payment plan and that's the trick.

02:27.840 --> 02:30.850
Once again we already used that in case number two.

02:31.020 --> 02:32.320
We have to know about it.

02:32.340 --> 02:38.310
Basically if you're going deeper invasion inference or Bayesian statistics you will always use that

02:38.310 --> 02:38.960
trick.

02:38.970 --> 02:40.020
It's a classic one.

02:40.290 --> 02:46.110
So it's good that we are seeing it a second time and forgive me if the explanation seems a little redundant

02:46.470 --> 02:48.700
but I want to make sure everybody gets it.

02:48.870 --> 02:49.510
All right.

02:49.620 --> 02:51.280
So let's do this.

02:51.300 --> 03:00.090
The trick is to check if a random number which we get by number again and more specifically by the random

03:00.390 --> 03:05.460
module from non-bio from which we'll get the rand function.

03:05.460 --> 03:12.690
So you have to understand that the rund function returns uniformly a random number between 0 and 1 because

03:12.690 --> 03:14.920
that's the default parameters here.

03:15.270 --> 03:25.980
So if this random number taken between 0 and 1 is lower than the conversion rate of the strategy number

03:25.980 --> 03:33.550
J here that we're dealing with in this specific loop applied to user number II or round number.

03:33.600 --> 03:38.610
Because each round corresponds to a different user while the cell that we're dealing with right now

03:38.680 --> 03:45.930
in array x row and con Jaker responding to Strategy number Jey applied to customer eye.

03:46.170 --> 03:48.690
Well we'll update that cell to one.

03:48.720 --> 03:49.570
And here we go.

03:49.620 --> 03:53.670
That's the only thing we have to do to create the simulation.

03:53.700 --> 03:59.730
So of course now we're going to execute this and I'm going to show you what we'll get and to even provide

03:59.780 --> 04:03.040
a further and stronger intuition of what we just did.

04:03.070 --> 04:05.010
I'm going to provide another example.

04:05.400 --> 04:10.980
So let's say first just press command or control us as to save.

04:11.130 --> 04:17.730
And now let's select everything and press command or control plus enter to execute.

04:17.790 --> 04:23.490
And now we're going to use our very practical variable explore because inside we're going to find not

04:23.490 --> 04:32.430
only our conversion rates list but mostly our simulated array as containing the simulation over 10000

04:32.430 --> 04:39.750
rounds of users connecting one by one one after the other to the online business retail Web site and

04:39.750 --> 04:45.380
then facing each of them a strategy trying to convert them to subscribe to the premium plan.

04:45.630 --> 04:46.850
So let's have a look.

04:47.190 --> 04:48.030
Here it is.

04:48.060 --> 04:53.200
I'm going to enlarge this and here it is.

04:53.220 --> 04:53.780
All right.

04:53.880 --> 05:01.030
So first of all let's remind and understand clearly that each row here corresponds to a user connecting

05:01.120 --> 05:06.150
to the online business it's a Web site and that happens one by one.

05:06.190 --> 05:11.700
One after the other so first thing that happened is the first user connects to the online business retail

05:11.730 --> 05:12.610
Web site.

05:12.760 --> 05:19.970
And according to our simulation this first user will only convert if we deploy the strategy of index

05:19.970 --> 05:26.710
6 which is the strategy number 7 because indexes started 0 and then for the same user if we deploy any

05:26.710 --> 05:27.760
other strategy.

05:27.930 --> 05:30.360
Well this customer will not convert.

05:30.360 --> 05:31.060
All right.

05:31.150 --> 05:32.260
And that makes around.

05:32.320 --> 05:32.980
That's it.

05:32.980 --> 05:38.830
Then the customer goes away and there goes the second customer who connects to the online business retail

05:38.860 --> 05:39.530
website.

05:39.640 --> 05:42.610
And same for this user based on our simulation.

05:42.820 --> 05:49.150
This customer will only subscribe to the premium plan if we deploy strategy of index 6 that is strategy

05:49.150 --> 05:50.440
number 7.

05:50.610 --> 05:56.960
That interesting that third user which is next round connects to the online business retail website.

05:56.980 --> 05:58.840
And for this customer.

05:58.990 --> 06:03.520
Well none of these strategies will lead to a conversion.

06:03.520 --> 06:04.120
All right.

06:04.240 --> 06:05.470
And same for the next user.

06:05.470 --> 06:08.030
Then the next user happens which is the next round.

06:08.080 --> 06:13.810
And for this customer none of the strategy will convert this customer to the premium plan.

06:13.810 --> 06:16.100
And then interestingly for first situation here.

06:16.210 --> 06:22.660
Well based on the simulation this customer does next customer in this next round would subscribe to

06:22.660 --> 06:29.720
the premium plan only if we deploy either strategy number one or strategy number two.

06:29.770 --> 06:35.740
And that could totally happen you know it's normal that we can have several ones in a row because each

06:35.740 --> 06:41.470
customer doesn't have to respond positively to only one strategy could respond positively to several

06:41.470 --> 06:42.410
strategies.

06:42.430 --> 06:46.310
So that means that here if we deploy a strategy number one.

06:46.420 --> 06:50.810
Well since we have one year this customer will convert to the premium plan.

06:50.940 --> 06:53.230
But then imagine we're doing this round again.

06:53.380 --> 06:59.920
Well if we show that is deployed this customer strategy number two while discussing mode also convert

07:00.130 --> 07:06.610
because you know he could also be attracted to the packages and strategy number two or you know sensitive

07:06.610 --> 07:09.430
to the way Strategy number two has deployed.

07:09.460 --> 07:10.570
So that's how it works.

07:10.630 --> 07:18.940
And if we scroll down we can notice you know that indeed strategy number seven seems to have the most

07:18.940 --> 07:25.550
ones but I'm going to show you this much more clearly with the following trick.

07:25.600 --> 07:31.600
I'm going to press OK now and I'm going to just to show you clearly what we just did.

07:31.600 --> 07:33.940
This is going to be so obvious now.

07:34.060 --> 07:39.030
I'm going to make a different list of conversion rates which will be the following.

07:39.040 --> 07:44.890
So let's imagine that the first strategy has an 0.1 conversion rate.

07:44.900 --> 07:50.850
Then the second one has an 0.2 conversion rate and the third one has 0.3 conversion rate.

07:51.040 --> 08:06.820
The fourth one and open for fifth one 0.5 6 1 0.6 7 1 0.7 H1 0.8 and the ninth one point nine.

08:07.120 --> 08:12.550
And I'm going to put this second line in comment so that doesn't execute.

08:12.730 --> 08:18.010
And now I'm going to reset the code again and we're going to execute again and you're going to see that

08:18.010 --> 08:24.640
with these conversion rate we're going to clearly see that the more we go to the right and the X-ray

08:25.030 --> 08:26.580
the more we'll get once.

08:26.590 --> 08:31.720
And that's because the more we get to the right the higher is the conversion rate and therefore the

08:31.720 --> 08:32.870
more we'll get one.

08:32.920 --> 08:38.050
I just want to show you this way you can clearly see that the way we did our simulation works very well.

08:38.050 --> 08:41.950
So I'm going to save select all this and execute again.

08:42.200 --> 08:46.830
And now let's have a look at X again and you're going to see how this is going to be.

08:47.020 --> 08:50.590
So I'm just now going to enlarge this.

08:50.980 --> 08:51.820
All right.

08:51.820 --> 08:58.090
And indeed we can see that the columns on the left that is the columns corresponding to the low conversion

08:58.090 --> 09:04.990
rate get mostly zeros and the more we go to the right the higher the conversion rate and therefore the

09:05.140 --> 09:12.630
more we get once we can clearly see that by skirling down over and over again.

09:12.790 --> 09:18.940
Indeed the last column corresponds to the strategy that has the highest conversion rate 0.9.

09:18.940 --> 09:23.020
And that's why it mostly gets once in its column.

09:23.020 --> 09:23.950
All right.

09:23.950 --> 09:26.100
So just wanted to show you this.

09:26.390 --> 09:31.990
That's again an important trick to know how to do when doing Bayesian statistics or working with Bayesian

09:31.990 --> 09:32.810
inference.

09:32.890 --> 09:35.560
So I can leave this line as a comment if you want.

09:35.770 --> 09:37.620
So you can have a look at it again.

09:37.630 --> 09:41.380
But let's get back our real conversion rates.

09:41.560 --> 09:42.840
And here we go.

09:42.840 --> 09:47.790
We're done with the simulation and now we're ready to implement Tompson sampling.

09:47.800 --> 09:51.120
I can't wait to do that in the next couple of tutorials.

09:51.130 --> 09:56.590
We're going to follow exactly the algorithm provided in the slide or in the book and Indian you will

09:56.590 --> 09:58.680
see how it is so powerful.
