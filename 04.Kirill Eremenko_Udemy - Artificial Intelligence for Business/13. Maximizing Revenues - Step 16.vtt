00:00.650 --> 00:06.410
Are right and here we go for the final tutorial I just restarted the kernel here to reset everything

00:06.410 --> 00:11.020
because once again we're going to execute the code several times to do some tests.

00:11.240 --> 00:17.570
And in this final tutorial we're going to plug the histogram of the selections to see how fast Thompson

00:17.570 --> 00:23.770
sampling is able to identify that is to catch that best strategy that has the highest conversion rate.

00:23.930 --> 00:29.500
So first of all we're going to check in did that it mostly selected the strategy over the 10000 rounds

00:29.510 --> 00:36.350
and then over 1000 rounds only and then we'll try to see from which round exactly it was able to really

00:36.350 --> 00:37.770
identify it.

00:37.820 --> 00:44.930
So let's do this let's plot the histogram and that's where that plot laid that pipe comes into play.

00:44.990 --> 00:51.860
Because indeed to plot this we're going to use my plot live which has a shortcut P L T and from matplotlib

00:51.860 --> 00:59.430
we're going to call the histogram function called just actually function inside which we simply input.

00:59.600 --> 01:07.520
Well the list of strategies selected by Tompson sampling and this list remember we introduced it right

01:07.520 --> 01:14.660
here Strachey's selected Thompson sampling and that's we run and populated each time here you know at

01:14.690 --> 01:22.200
each round and in this huge for loop looping over the 10000 round right here Strachey's elected Tums

01:22.210 --> 01:30.040
and sampling that append the strategy selected at this specific round that is for this specific customer.

01:30.350 --> 01:33.600
So let's base that here and that's it.

01:33.650 --> 01:39.590
You know that could be done we could be done with the plot here but I always like to give a nice title

01:39.590 --> 01:44.820
and give some nice labels to the x axis the y axis and sometimes some legends.

01:44.930 --> 01:52.160
He wanted legends but let's give a title first so I'm calling the title function again from matplotlib

01:52.640 --> 01:54.010
and here it in quotes.

01:54.050 --> 02:01.900
I'm going to put the title in let's say that it is histogram of selections.

02:02.300 --> 02:10.010
OK then let's give a label to the x axis or I'm using the X label function.

02:10.130 --> 02:17.360
And again quotes I'm going to give the following label to the x axis which will be strategy because

02:17.360 --> 02:23.570
indeed and this histogram on the x axis will have each of the nine strategies and for each of the nine

02:23.570 --> 02:31.050
strategies we'll have on the y axis the number of times each of these nine strategies was selected.

02:31.070 --> 02:39.290
And that's why the next step here is to plot the Y Levo which will be exactly what we just said.

02:39.290 --> 02:51.450
That is the number of times the strategy was selected perfect number of times the strategy was selected

02:51.810 --> 02:53.710
for each of the nine stretches.

02:54.090 --> 03:01.440
And then finally last thing we're going to ask by then to show it just like that so that we can indeed

03:01.680 --> 03:02.640
see it.

03:02.640 --> 03:03.660
All right.

03:03.660 --> 03:04.340
And that's.

03:04.380 --> 03:09.310
That was actually the last and final line of this whole implementation.

03:09.600 --> 03:16.080
So as you can see we can appreciate the contrast between the power of Tompson sampling and its simplicity

03:16.080 --> 03:19.860
because it required less than one hundred lines of code.

03:19.890 --> 03:21.300
That's pretty awesome.

03:21.300 --> 03:24.620
All right so let's just check the number of rounds we have here.

03:24.750 --> 03:30.570
Well remember we tried with one hundred thousand rounds but let's first try with ten thousand rounds.

03:30.570 --> 03:39.240
Our original number of rounds and now we're ready to select everything and check if indeed the best

03:39.240 --> 03:45.450
strategy that is the one with the highest conversion rate was the one most selected by Thompson sampling.

03:45.450 --> 03:49.990
This is exactly what we're about to see on this histogram that we just played it.

03:50.160 --> 03:52.380
So here we go let's execute.

03:52.680 --> 03:57.880
And here is the histogram indeed on this histogram strategy number seven.

03:57.990 --> 04:04.290
So it has indexes because indexes started 0 but it is the strategy number 7 and it is the one that was

04:04.290 --> 04:12.090
mostly selected the most selected by Thompson sampling and some of them were also pretty much selected

04:12.090 --> 04:18.150
of course much less than this one but these will correspond of course to the other strategies.

04:18.190 --> 04:19.350
Had a good conversion rate.

04:19.350 --> 04:25.970
Remember that this is stretching them before and it had I think 0.16 know 16 percent conversion rate.

04:26.100 --> 04:30.860
And this one's range number to remember had 0.13 13 percent conversion rates.

04:30.870 --> 04:33.660
That's why they were also pretty much selected.

04:33.660 --> 04:38.840
But you have to understand that they were actually selected around the beginning of the process.

04:38.850 --> 04:45.030
You know when Thompson sampling was experimenting with the trial error that's when you know at the beginning

04:45.030 --> 04:47.840
around probably the 500 first rounds.

04:47.880 --> 04:53.370
Well the beta distributions of the second strategy here the fourth one year and the best one that is

04:53.370 --> 04:59.910
the seventh one here where probably shifted the three of them to the right and this one was not yet

05:00.120 --> 05:03.620
shifted much more than the other ones to the right.

05:03.680 --> 05:08.760
You know that's why there were some selections of these strategies at the beginning but then this one

05:08.760 --> 05:12.100
was more and more shifted to the right compared to these two.

05:12.180 --> 05:17.400
And this one as well and the more it was shifted to the right the higher was the density of conversion

05:17.400 --> 05:24.630
rates for that 7 strategy and that's when Thompson sampling started to mostly only select the strategy

05:24.630 --> 05:25.580
number seven.

05:25.830 --> 05:28.530
That's what happens you know during the whole process.

05:28.830 --> 05:36.060
And now what I would like to check out is if we also get that kind of curve you know with this dominant

05:36.180 --> 05:42.420
selection of strategy number seven with only one thousand rounds Let's check that it's going to be interesting

05:42.900 --> 05:48.690
because indeed if that's the case that means that Thompson sampling will have been able to identify

05:48.690 --> 05:51.780
the best strategy in less than 1000 rounds.

05:51.780 --> 05:57.600
You know at this point we don't know if it identified it in the first thousand rounds or in the second

05:57.600 --> 06:00.310
thousand rounds or maybe in the 5000 rounds.

06:00.330 --> 06:00.930
I don't know.

06:01.080 --> 06:06.700
We don't know so that's what we would like to check right now and therefore I'm going to update that

06:06.700 --> 06:08.120
to 1000 rounds.

06:08.130 --> 06:12.730
I'm going to save I'm going to reset everything even if we don't really have to restart.

06:12.730 --> 06:19.420
Colonel Yes and now let's execute that again with 1000 rounds.

06:19.590 --> 06:20.720
Here we go.

06:21.180 --> 06:21.680
OK.

06:21.720 --> 06:24.120
So here you see that's interesting.

06:24.120 --> 06:25.620
With 1000 rounds.

06:25.650 --> 06:31.170
Thompson sampling was still able to identify the best strategy because indeed it is still the one that

06:31.170 --> 06:32.900
was most selected.

06:32.920 --> 06:38.310
So that's really good but of course since only one dozen rounds happened here and during the first hundred

06:38.310 --> 06:38.950
rounds.

06:39.120 --> 06:45.930
Well Thompson something was exploring to see which one was the best strategy and some of these strategies

06:45.930 --> 06:49.810
had their beta distributions still shifted pretty much to the right.

06:49.980 --> 06:55.720
And that's why a lot of them were selected here in 1000 rounds so that's why we get this.

06:55.950 --> 06:57.720
And now let's push it even further.

06:57.810 --> 07:00.250
Let's try with 500 rounds.

07:00.420 --> 07:03.350
You know let's see if in 500 rounds.

07:03.480 --> 07:09.830
Well Thompson something we're still able to identify this best strategy strategy number seven.

07:10.080 --> 07:17.600
So I just restore the kernel again and I'm selecting everything again and executing again.

07:17.790 --> 07:20.290
Oh wow that's impressive.

07:20.610 --> 07:22.810
So maybe we were lucky on this one.

07:22.950 --> 07:27.690
Let's do this again actually OK see where we're lucky on this one.

07:27.720 --> 07:28.500
I knew this.

07:28.610 --> 07:35.460
It requires time and sampling more than 500 rounds to really really identify the best range we can do

07:35.460 --> 07:36.580
it again just to make sure.

07:36.600 --> 07:41.010
But you know if we got this once at least that means that 500 rounds is not enough.

07:41.010 --> 07:48.420
So you know probably Tompson sampling and defy the best strategy between 500 rounds and 1000 rounds

07:48.420 --> 07:56.400
and actually we can check that in our strategy selected TS list but to check this let's put that back

07:56.400 --> 08:02.170
to 10000 rounds and let's see at reach round approximately.

08:02.230 --> 08:05.140
Thompson something was able to identify the best strategy.

08:05.220 --> 08:09.240
So I'm going to show you you're going to understand what I mean when I want to do right now.

08:09.360 --> 08:12.290
So let's execute that again 10000 rounds.

08:12.310 --> 08:14.500
Ok we get a good Instagram for sure.

08:14.670 --> 08:21.960
But now let's have a look at our strategy selected T S list which is a list of the strategies selected

08:21.960 --> 08:24.100
by Tomsen sampling over the rounds.

08:24.180 --> 08:30.990
Here are all the strategies selected at each round so these other rounds starting from zero and here

08:30.990 --> 08:31.740
are strategies.

08:31.740 --> 08:38.880
So remember what we want to check is from which round we get mostly our best strategy selected.

08:39.060 --> 08:45.660
And since these are still indexes then the best Regy which is tragen number seven but has index 6 because

08:45.660 --> 08:47.250
again indexes started 0.

08:47.250 --> 08:51.390
So let's see from which round we only see six.

08:51.450 --> 08:54.240
So I'm going to enlarge this.

08:54.270 --> 08:59.540
So right now we are at the 100 rounds and we don't see much.

08:59.640 --> 09:01.430
We don't see many sixes here.

09:01.500 --> 09:07.260
That's because it's the beginning it's still exploring the beta distributions of at least the top three

09:07.470 --> 09:12.650
best strategies with the top three highest conversion rates are still a bit shifted to the right.

09:12.690 --> 09:18.060
But then as you can see here we can see more and more six square in terms and something's starting to

09:18.060 --> 09:19.970
realize what is the best strategy.

09:19.970 --> 09:26.820
That's when the beta distribution of the seventh strategy starts to be pretty well shifted to the right

09:27.030 --> 09:30.910
compared to the other beta distributions of the other strategies.

09:31.120 --> 09:36.130
And see here we are almost reaching the 500 round.

09:36.300 --> 09:42.980
And as I told you we don't see dominant sixes you no index is of the seven strategy which is our best

09:42.980 --> 09:43.630
strategy.

09:43.830 --> 09:49.340
So that's why it 500 rounds in know when we tested with an equal 500 rounds.

09:49.530 --> 09:56.050
Well the histogram was pretty borderline but as we progressed further further into the rounds.

09:56.220 --> 10:01.350
Well naturally we're going to see more and more sixes we can already feel that you know we can already

10:01.350 --> 10:04.430
see that we have more and more sixes as it is the case here.

10:04.440 --> 10:10.600
You know here we have reached 700 rounds and we can indeed see many more sixes.

10:10.860 --> 10:16.540
You know a dummy selection of the strategy of index that is the seven strategy.

10:16.800 --> 10:24.570
And then here we almost reach 1000 rounds and still we can see now we can see now we can really see

10:24.840 --> 10:26.080
many more sixes.

10:26.130 --> 10:29.590
Of course sometimes we still see some other strategies like that.

10:29.610 --> 10:35.760
That's because some other beta distributions of other strategies have high conversion rates with still

10:36.000 --> 10:37.440
a non-zero probability.

10:37.440 --> 10:45.390
Or you know a not too low probability but really really over time statistically Well of course what

10:45.390 --> 10:51.810
we get is mostly selection of the seven strategy because of course it's beta distribution is really

10:52.110 --> 10:57.480
more shifted to the right with therefore highly positive probabilities by highly positive.

10:57.480 --> 11:03.180
No I mean 20 percent or 15 percent for the highest range of conversion rates.

11:03.180 --> 11:08.440
Now I'm going to scroll down much more and really we can only see success here mostly.

11:08.610 --> 11:10.600
That's exactly what we said.

11:10.800 --> 11:16.830
We can see mostly sixes and sometimes other strategies selected because we still have a non-zero probability

11:16.860 --> 11:20.120
for lower conversion rates but there we go.

11:20.130 --> 11:26.130
Now I'm really scrolling down and I'm having the impression that I'm only seeing success and we finally

11:26.130 --> 11:32.710
reached the final round with mostly selections of strategy number seven of index is perfect.

11:32.890 --> 11:35.930
So that's what I wanted to show you to finish this section.

11:35.940 --> 11:41.040
So keep in mind that we did a huge accomplishment here again you know relative return of 97 percent

11:41.040 --> 11:46.620
that is our Tompson something else doubled the performance of our Random strategy benchmark.

11:46.770 --> 11:52.500
And as we saw in the Perusia Tauriel this online retail business made a tremendous amount of money thanks

11:52.500 --> 11:55.170
to our powerful Tompson something algorithm.

11:55.170 --> 11:58.470
So congratulations for tackling the third case study on this.

11:58.470 --> 12:03.930
Good note I'm going to leave you with a little homework now and I'll provide the solution right after

12:03.930 --> 12:04.560
that.

12:04.560 --> 12:06.330
So really try to do it by yourself.

12:06.450 --> 12:07.420
Have fun with it.

12:07.530 --> 12:09.140
And until then enjoy AI.
