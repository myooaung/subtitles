00:01.480 --> 00:07.300
All right are you ready for the next and final step of the whole cube learning algorithm.

00:07.300 --> 00:13.780
Indeed we just computed the temporal difference and now the only remaining thing we have to do is to

00:13.780 --> 00:19.540
of course update the cube value by just adding the temporal difference multiplied by the learning rate

00:19.600 --> 00:20.370
alpha.

00:20.680 --> 00:21.630
So let's do this.

00:21.670 --> 00:27.620
We're going to end this very easily because indeed it's a simple formula to translate into code.

00:27.730 --> 00:29.350
So let's do this.

00:29.350 --> 00:39.760
We just need to take the cube values into our matrix of q values the Q value of the current state s

00:39.760 --> 00:48.820
t and then as we see the action 80 you know that we played in step 2 but remember the action is nothing

00:48.820 --> 00:56.350
else than the state as Plus one that is next state that we reach by playing that action 80 and therefore

00:56.710 --> 01:02.640
here instead of bring this action we can just put next 8.

01:02.640 --> 01:03.020
All right.

01:03.020 --> 01:06.250
So this is the q value that we have to update.

01:06.540 --> 01:13.680
And now there are two ways we can update it the elegant way is by incremented this way by using this

01:13.710 --> 01:14.740
plus equal.

01:14.880 --> 01:23.530
And then just adding what we need to incremented by which is Alpha multiplied by the temporal difference.

01:23.530 --> 01:26.350
All right so that's the first way the most elegant way.

01:26.350 --> 01:31.910
And if you really want to you know clearly see what is going on here.

01:32.110 --> 01:41.260
Well what is happening here with this plus equals is that we are updating the previous Q value of the

01:41.260 --> 01:48.070
current state and state by just adding the learning rates multiplied by the temporal difference.

01:48.070 --> 01:49.540
Right that's exactly the same.

01:49.690 --> 02:01.490
So here is the previous Q value that is this q value here and this one is the new q value after the

02:01.500 --> 02:04.110
object that is after adding this.

02:04.400 --> 02:07.310
So this one is exactly this one right.

02:07.310 --> 02:12.970
So that's just to explain how we can translate a formula into code.

02:13.100 --> 02:14.080
And here we are.

02:14.090 --> 02:15.020
Congratulation.

02:15.020 --> 02:19.640
Now we are done with the whole Q learning algorithm and then what does it mean.

02:19.640 --> 02:23.860
Well that means we're ready to go into production.

02:23.990 --> 02:24.860
That's exciting.

02:24.860 --> 02:31.520
And speaking of going into production well part 3 is ready so we'll structure this way will actually

02:31.520 --> 02:35.610
make a tool that takes as inputs the starting location.

02:35.760 --> 02:43.220
That is the location where our autonomous wherehouse robot is at a specific time t and the ending location

02:43.550 --> 02:51.260
which remember is the top priority location and this tool by taking those two inputs will have to return

02:51.380 --> 02:56.750
the shortest route going from the starting location to the ending location.

02:56.750 --> 03:03.470
And of course to do that to compute the shortest route well it will use of course the Q values that

03:03.500 --> 03:11.800
were computed through this learning process on 1000 iterations of course before returning anything you

03:11.830 --> 03:13.960
know from this tool that will make in part 3.

03:14.180 --> 03:22.070
Well we'll run this with a high reward in the matrix of words which will be in the location where we

03:22.070 --> 03:22.920
have to go.

03:23.120 --> 03:24.710
So we'll make that manually first.

03:24.710 --> 03:30.860
But then at the end and in the final homework's of the section will improve our tools so that we don't

03:30.860 --> 03:36.350
even have to manually change the reward in the top priority location.

03:36.350 --> 03:40.080
So we'll have several steps of going into production first.

03:40.080 --> 03:43.780
A simple solution and then an improved solution.

03:43.940 --> 03:48.490
So let's do that in the next couple of tutorials and until then enjoy AI.
