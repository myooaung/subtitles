00:00.430 --> 00:03.990
Highs and welcome to case study number three.

00:04.020 --> 00:09.630
Maximizing the revenues of an online retail business with Tompson sampling.

00:09.630 --> 00:16.560
So here we're going to tackle the part of artificial intelligence where you can leverage it to maximize

00:16.560 --> 00:18.850
the revenues in your business.

00:19.020 --> 00:23.020
And that's why the case is here to show how we can do this.

00:23.100 --> 00:29.370
It's going to be about an online retail business that has many customers you know a lot of customers

00:29.610 --> 00:31.680
like you can count them by millions.

00:31.680 --> 00:34.380
So you can think for example of eBay or Amazon.

00:34.590 --> 00:42.450
And the goal of this online retail business is to get the maximum of its customers to subscribe to a

00:42.450 --> 00:43.580
premium plan.

00:43.680 --> 00:48.990
You know they have a premium plan where the customers pay a certain amount of money every month or every

00:48.990 --> 00:49.530
year.

00:49.710 --> 00:55.050
And the goal of this online retail business is that instead of having customers who only pay to buy

00:55.050 --> 01:00.900
products online while this online retail business would like its customers to subscribe to this premium

01:00.900 --> 01:04.640
plan that is going to offer them many great options.

01:04.680 --> 01:12.030
And so this online retail business has a great strategy team taking care of all the marketing strategy

01:12.030 --> 01:15.480
the selling strategy and the business strategy as well.

01:15.720 --> 01:23.790
And this team right now has this specific mission to get the maximum customers to subscribe to this

01:23.790 --> 01:24.830
premium plan.

01:25.110 --> 01:30.810
So if that happens of course that will maximize revenues because of course this premium plan has been

01:30.810 --> 01:35.480
settled so that it's a win win for both the customer and the business.

01:35.520 --> 01:41.220
So the more customers subscribe to this premium plan the more revenues just online retail business generates

01:41.640 --> 01:46.210
and therefore we have to find the best strategy for them to get the maximum conversions.

01:46.530 --> 01:50.160
And they're going to do that with Thomson sampling indeed.

01:50.280 --> 01:52.940
Thompson sampling you have to know about this algorithm.

01:52.980 --> 02:00.140
It's the most powerful algorithm for a specific problem in reinforcement learning called the multi-alarm

02:00.230 --> 02:01.430
been the problem.

02:01.620 --> 02:07.800
And the thing about the multi on Bennett problem is that it can be applied to many many many different

02:07.800 --> 02:12.660
business problems and you're going to see that now we're trying to get the maximum customers to subscribe

02:12.660 --> 02:13.920
to premium plan.

02:13.920 --> 02:20.370
Well we can set up an environment for which we can apply the most powerful algorithm for this which

02:20.370 --> 02:21.570
is Tompson sampling.

02:21.750 --> 02:24.400
So probably some of you already know about this.

02:24.440 --> 02:29.980
THOMPSON something algorithm maybe someone you come from the machine learning course and already studied

02:29.980 --> 02:30.450
it.

02:30.450 --> 02:35.310
So it's good if you already know about this but it's really important to include it in this course because

02:35.610 --> 02:41.700
this is a business course you know we explain how to leverage artificial intelligence to either optimize

02:41.700 --> 02:47.490
the processes minimize the cost maximize the revenues or optimize the profitability of a business.

02:47.640 --> 02:50.480
And therefore we have to include Tompson sampling.

02:50.480 --> 02:55.450
So if you're coming from the machinery cause well don't worry the case they will be different.

02:55.560 --> 02:57.030
The code will be improved.

02:57.090 --> 02:59.130
The explanations will be improved as well.

02:59.130 --> 03:01.010
We're going to do our whole simulation.

03:01.050 --> 03:05.250
We're going to add some new features and we're going to add some more computations and extra things

03:05.250 --> 03:06.970
so it will be very different.

03:06.990 --> 03:08.910
And mostly it will be improved.

03:08.910 --> 03:11.770
And essentially it has to be included in the scores.

03:11.940 --> 03:18.540
As an example to explain how we can indeed maximize the revenues of a business by leveraging artificial

03:18.540 --> 03:19.590
intelligence.

03:19.620 --> 03:20.570
So here we go.

03:20.670 --> 03:25.920
Let's define the plan of attack for this third and final part.

03:26.070 --> 03:30.790
So as we can see this is going to be again a plan of attack in three parts.

03:30.900 --> 03:33.570
First part will be about defining the environment.

03:33.720 --> 03:39.960
And as you can see you can already notice that I removed the defining the states and I'll explain why

03:39.960 --> 03:40.560
later.

03:40.680 --> 03:43.520
So we'll only find the actions and the words.

03:43.650 --> 03:48.930
Then the second step of this plan of attack will be of course to explain the solution that we're going

03:48.930 --> 03:51.060
to build that is Tompson assembling.

03:51.300 --> 03:57.180
And for this we'll have to explain first and not on the problem and then we'll give the intuition and

03:57.180 --> 03:59.710
the math details of DMs and Templin.

03:59.760 --> 04:04.980
Again you have the choice to either watch the intuition lectures by curial which I'll provide in step

04:05.000 --> 04:12.280
2 or read the book where as well all the mathematical details and intuition are provided.

04:12.420 --> 04:13.800
And of course you can do both.

04:13.890 --> 04:14.970
That's even better.

04:15.240 --> 04:21.030
And then as a third step of this plan of attack will implement the solution in Python and we'll do that

04:21.030 --> 04:22.380
in two steps we'll build.

04:22.380 --> 04:29.220
First the solution that is will implement the whole Thompson centric algorithm and then we'll go into

04:29.370 --> 04:30.010
production.
