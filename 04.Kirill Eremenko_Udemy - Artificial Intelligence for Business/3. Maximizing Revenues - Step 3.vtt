00:00.750 --> 00:01.470
All right.

00:01.470 --> 00:09.210
So one last thing I want to say before we move on to the next step that is the solution is that of course

00:09.210 --> 00:15.930
the challenge here you know the deal here is that we must find the best strategy as fast as possible

00:16.350 --> 00:22.320
because indeed deploying these strategies for each of these customers has cost and therefore the more

00:22.320 --> 00:28.880
we try to experiment and find better edges that is the more rounds it takes us to find the best strategies.

00:29.190 --> 00:31.360
The more costly it will be for the business.

00:31.590 --> 00:36.540
But then mostly Let's not forget the ultimate goal of what we're doing here.

00:36.540 --> 00:38.910
Mostly if we find the best strategy.

00:39.120 --> 00:43.100
Well that means we'll get the maximum customers to subscribe the premium plan.

00:43.260 --> 00:49.230
And that means we'll maximize the monthly or yearly fixed income coming from the subscriptions.

00:49.260 --> 00:54.870
And you know if you are an online retail business with millions of customers well of course if you managed

00:54.870 --> 01:00.600
to convert the maximum customers to subscribe to your premium plan well that's going to be a huge win

01:00.600 --> 01:06.120
for your business because among these nine strategies here one of them has the best conversion rate

01:06.330 --> 01:11.670
like let's say for example 20 percent or 20 percent conversion rate you know that would be a really

01:11.940 --> 01:13.220
powerful strategy.

01:13.380 --> 01:19.530
Well if you managed to find that strategy that means you will manage to convert 20 percent of your millions

01:19.530 --> 01:24.780
of customers to subscribe to the premium plan and therefore the business will make many more millions

01:25.020 --> 01:29.140
of dollars every month or every year coming from the subscriptions.

01:29.160 --> 01:30.750
So we have to find the strategy.

01:30.870 --> 01:37.400
And let me show you just quickly the algorithm that will find its best strategy its name is Thompson

01:37.410 --> 01:38.900
sampling and here we go.

01:38.940 --> 01:43.430
Thats the whole algorithm we will implement in this course.

01:43.440 --> 01:49.230
All right now we will move on to Step 2 of this plan of attack so the solution both the intuition and

01:49.230 --> 01:53.900
the theory with Kyrios intuition lectures dont forget to have a look at the book.

01:53.910 --> 02:00.060
You also have all the details and now so you in step three for implementation in Python.

02:00.060 --> 02:01.620
Until then enjoy AI.
