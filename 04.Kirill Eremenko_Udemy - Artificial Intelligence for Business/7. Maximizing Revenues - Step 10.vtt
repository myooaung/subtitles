00:00.450 --> 00:04.110
Are right let's do this let's implement Tompson something.

00:04.440 --> 00:10.230
So I suggest we're going to do it this way that is where we're going to dedicate one tutorial for each

00:10.230 --> 00:15.780
step of the three steps here and therefore in the story we're going to tackle this first step.

00:15.810 --> 00:21.810
Step one where we have to take a random draw from the following distribution the beta distribution for

00:21.900 --> 00:23.590
each of the strategy.

00:23.760 --> 00:30.690
Therefore you guess now that we have to make a second trip so let's do this let's make a second for

00:30.690 --> 00:39.120
loop that is going to loop over all the different strategies that is all of our nine strategies.

00:39.120 --> 00:45.630
So again we have to loop from 0 to D and if you want you can only include D because zero is a default

00:45.630 --> 00:46.550
lower bound.

00:46.610 --> 00:52.140
So for e in range 0 the that is for each of our nine strategies.

00:52.350 --> 00:53.930
Well what are we going to do.

00:54.150 --> 01:01.690
Well we have to take a random drop from the beta distribution with the following two parameters.

01:01.920 --> 01:08.600
So I remind that this parameter is the number of times the strategy I has received are one we wanted

01:08.940 --> 01:15.840
to run and and this number here is the number of times the strategy I has received is zero reward up

01:15.840 --> 01:16.760
to round it.

01:17.040 --> 01:19.560
And so let me just remind the intuition of all this.

01:19.590 --> 01:26.040
It's really important that you get this and to explain this I'm going to take again our beta distribution.

01:26.300 --> 01:30.950
So let's suppose as it is the case in this slide that we have three strategies.

01:31.080 --> 01:35.380
Well we have three beta distributions corresponding to each of these three strategies.

01:35.550 --> 01:40.800
That's one beta distribution corresponding to first strategy second beta distribution corresponding

01:40.800 --> 01:46.260
to the second strategy and a third distribution corresponding to a third strategy.

01:46.260 --> 01:52.590
And so at the beginning remember we initialized the number of times the strategies have received are

01:52.590 --> 01:58.920
we 1 2 zeros for all the strategies and same we initialized the number of times the strategies have

01:58.920 --> 02:05.680
received a zero word with zeroes because at the beginning all the strategies have not received anything.

02:06.000 --> 02:13.580
And therefore since here we have these two parameters in the baby's Shushan Well that means that each

02:13.580 --> 02:17.630
strategy at the beginning will have the same beta distribution.

02:17.660 --> 02:24.110
No they will all be stacked on the same one and then the most important thing to understand is that

02:24.530 --> 02:32.450
as soon as a strategy gets a one word well this will be incremented by 1 as in step 3.

02:32.450 --> 02:38.390
Now if the strategy selector received one word increment this by one and therefore this is well will

02:38.390 --> 02:44.060
be incremented by 1 and the most important thing to understand is that as soon as this is incremented

02:44.060 --> 02:51.320
by 1 the beta distribution of this strategy will be shifted a little bit to the right so that it gets

02:51.500 --> 02:55.730
positive probabilities for higher conversion rates.

02:55.730 --> 02:56.060
Right.

02:56.060 --> 03:02.480
Remember remember that on the x axis are the conversion rate that is the average rate of success over

03:02.480 --> 03:03.270
many rounds.

03:03.470 --> 03:06.710
And on the y axis is the probability.

03:06.710 --> 03:13.390
So as soon as we get one we word while this is increment by one this is increment by one as well.

03:13.460 --> 03:20.810
And therefore this is shifted to the right so that some higher conversion rates have positive probabilities

03:21.440 --> 03:28.230
and same as soon as we get a Zuel reward like when the strategy is like that gets a zero reward.

03:28.400 --> 03:30.650
Then this is increment by 1.

03:30.650 --> 03:38.300
So this is increment by 1 and therefore this is shifted to the left so that the lower conversion rates

03:38.530 --> 03:42.960
that is the lower rates of successors have more positive probabilities.

03:43.190 --> 03:49.550
And since the average conversion rate corresponds to this number here in the middle of the beta distribution

03:49.850 --> 03:55.250
and same for this one the average conversion rate corresponds to this number here in the middle of the

03:55.250 --> 04:02.000
beta distribution will progressively as you know the one we war strategies are shifted to the right

04:02.300 --> 04:05.480
and the zero reward strategies are shifted to the left.

04:05.630 --> 04:12.350
Well their average conversion rate are respectively more shifted to the right and to the left and therefore

04:12.350 --> 04:17.560
that's how Thompson sampling little by little will manage to get separately.

04:17.690 --> 04:24.020
The best strategy that has the highest conversion rate by shifting it more and more to the right each

04:24.020 --> 04:26.140
time it gets on one word.

04:26.300 --> 04:33.260
And then as well by shifting the other strategies that have a lower conversion rate to the left so that

04:33.530 --> 04:40.760
when we reach step 2 and we get you know the maximum of the conversion rates well since the best strategy

04:40.760 --> 04:44.690
was shifted to the right and the other strategies were shifted to the left.

04:44.780 --> 04:51.230
Well the further we get into the rounds the more we will select the best strategy because the best strategy

04:51.230 --> 04:52.710
has the highest conversion rate.

04:52.820 --> 04:58.610
And therefore since we get the max here well automatically over the rounds we'll get more and more this.

04:58.700 --> 05:00.010
Best strategy.

05:00.020 --> 05:05.810
All right so that's the whole intuition behind it and that's exactly what we will implement with Tompson

05:05.810 --> 05:06.790
sampling.

05:06.830 --> 05:12.290
So it's important to remind this intuition before we implemented things so that when we implement this

05:12.620 --> 05:17.660
all the logic flows easily in our brain and in our hands coding the algorithm.

05:17.660 --> 05:24.280
All right let's do this let's go back to the code to implement step 1.

05:24.710 --> 05:25.250
All right.

05:25.250 --> 05:32.270
So we're about to get the random draw for each of the nine strategies and we're going to call this random

05:32.270 --> 05:40.310
draw random data which will be exactly this random draw for each of the nine strategies and to get it

05:40.550 --> 05:47.990
we're going to use Well the random module we imported here are random and from the random module.

05:48.000 --> 05:56.450
We're going to call the peda variate function the beta void function which will exactly return a random

05:56.450 --> 06:01.300
drug from the beta distribution of the following parameters.

06:01.300 --> 06:04.730
And therefore that's exactly what we have to in in this function.

06:04.960 --> 06:08.360
And I want and press one and zero and plus 1.

06:08.420 --> 06:09.580
So let's do this.

06:09.580 --> 06:10.700
We already have them.

06:10.900 --> 06:13.900
And I want and corresponds to this very goal.

06:13.990 --> 06:19.330
There is number of times the strategy has received that we were one of two around and remember that

06:19.330 --> 06:25.420
this is a list of nine elements corresponding to the nine strategies so we'll get the right strategy

06:25.430 --> 06:28.620
we're dealing with right now which is strategy of index.

06:28.900 --> 06:30.400
So let's get this.

06:30.400 --> 06:35.700
That's the first parameter of our beta distribution.

06:35.800 --> 06:42.280
And as we just said since this is a list we need to get the index by which corresponds to the strategy

06:42.280 --> 06:43.630
we're dealing with right now.

06:43.840 --> 06:47.040
And let's not forget to add a plus one.

06:47.290 --> 06:48.360
Okay perfect.

06:48.550 --> 06:57.540
And now let's get the second parameter which is the same thing but with the zero rewards that is the

06:57.540 --> 07:03.150
number of times the strategy I has received a zero reward and that's it.

07:03.150 --> 07:11.870
That's all we need to do to get the random draw from the beta distribution of this specific strategy.

07:11.860 --> 07:14.170
We're dealing with right now in the for loop.

07:14.430 --> 07:18.300
So that will give us this random draw for each of the nine strategies.

07:18.480 --> 07:25.080
And so now we're ready to move on to Step 2 to select that is to play the action to select the strategy

07:25.380 --> 07:31.350
that has the highest of these random draws we got for each of our nine strategies.

07:31.440 --> 07:33.610
So let's do this in a next tutorial.

07:33.640 --> 07:35.370
And until then enjoy AI.
