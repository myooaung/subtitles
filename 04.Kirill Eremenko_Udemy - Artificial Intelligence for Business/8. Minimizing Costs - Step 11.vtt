00:00.360 --> 00:02.910
Are right here we go let's tackle the next step.

00:02.910 --> 00:09.780
Specific to our case study because indeed what we have to do now is to compute the delta of intrinsic

00:09.780 --> 00:16.860
temperature which we can do because we have updated the atmospheric temperature the number of users

00:17.130 --> 00:18.650
and the new rate of data.

00:18.780 --> 00:24.780
And that's because assumption 1 says that the intrinsic temperature of the server that is the temperature

00:24.780 --> 00:31.620
of the server that evolves independently of the actions of any system whether it is the eye or the alternative

00:31.620 --> 00:38.070
system is given by this formula which is atmospheric temperature plus one point twenty five times the

00:38.070 --> 00:41.960
number of users plus one point twenty five times the rate of data.

00:42.240 --> 00:48.230
And why do we have to compute more precisely the delta of that intrinsic temperature.

00:48.240 --> 00:55.310
That's because remember that's crucial to understand that intrinsic temperature is to come part of our

00:55.320 --> 00:57.310
two separate simulations.

00:57.450 --> 01:02.760
The one when we follow the evolution of the surface temperature regulated by the AI and the other one

01:02.760 --> 01:08.580
when we follow the evolution of the surface temperature regulated by the alternative system when we

01:08.580 --> 01:10.080
have no AI.

01:10.320 --> 01:16.140
And in order to make these two simulations make total sense well they have to follow a common base which

01:16.140 --> 01:20.850
is that same evolution of the intrinsic temperature.

01:20.850 --> 01:22.950
So that's why we have to compute the delta here.

01:22.950 --> 01:27.930
So that then we can update the surface temperature when we have the eye and the surface temperature

01:27.940 --> 01:29.520
when we have no A-I.

01:29.580 --> 01:33.730
So let's do this let's compute the delta of intrinsic temperature.

01:33.990 --> 01:36.180
And since we're going to compute a Delta.

01:36.270 --> 01:44.940
Well we're going to keep the old value of the intrinsic temperature of the server right before the update

01:44.950 --> 01:48.490
so past intrinsic temperature will be the temperature of the server.

01:48.660 --> 01:53.840
Just before we update the environment and therefore we'll said that equal to.

01:54.010 --> 02:01.410
Well self that intrinsic temperature which is one of the variables of our environment object.

02:01.410 --> 02:07.650
And so now that we have the past intrinsic temperature just before the date well we can get the new

02:07.950 --> 02:10.720
intrinsic temperature right after the update.

02:10.740 --> 02:16.290
And so what I'm going to do now is I'm going to take our self intrinsic Vrable because that's what we

02:16.290 --> 02:21.950
have to date now to get the new intrinsic temperature right up to the date and how you update it.

02:22.140 --> 02:29.340
Well since we've just updated the atmospheric temperature the number of users and the rate of data transmission.

02:29.400 --> 02:35.680
Well that means we're ready to get rectally the new intrinsic temperature by just applying the formula.

02:35.700 --> 02:38.580
Assumption 1 which is given right here.

02:38.580 --> 02:48.150
So I'm copying this and I'm going to paste it right here because indeed this is the new number of users

02:48.150 --> 02:49.520
that was just did it.

02:49.560 --> 02:52.450
This is a new rate of data transmission that was just a dated.

02:52.620 --> 02:56.640
And this is the atmospheric temperature that was dated as well right here.

02:56.790 --> 03:03.270
So we now have the best intrinsic temperature just before the date the new engine that temperature right

03:03.270 --> 03:04.170
after the update.

03:04.320 --> 03:11.940
And so we're ready to get what on that is the delta of intrinsic temperature happening during that specific

03:12.000 --> 03:15.800
iteration when we observe this environment at this time.

03:15.870 --> 03:16.680
And so here we go.

03:16.680 --> 03:18.040
Let's get that Delta.

03:18.120 --> 03:25.050
So I'm going to go to a new line and I'm going to introduce a new variable which will be Delta and then

03:25.050 --> 03:33.300
I can just take this because what I want to get is Delta intrinsic temperature and that will be of course

03:33.390 --> 03:42.010
the difference between the new intrinsic temperature of the server right after the update minus the

03:42.210 --> 03:48.840
old intrinsic temperature just before the update perfect.

03:48.840 --> 03:54.600
Now we have one of the two elements that we need to compute the new service temperature when there is

03:54.600 --> 03:55.420
the AI.

03:55.470 --> 04:01.410
The other element is indeed the delta temperature cursed by the AI that is the delta of temperature

04:01.680 --> 04:07.750
coming from the action of the AI after it let its action to regulate the surface temperature.

04:07.830 --> 04:11.560
So let's compute that Delta as well to compute the delta.

04:11.610 --> 04:17.730
Well we're going to have to make two conditions because indeed this delta depends on the direction of

04:17.730 --> 04:20.350
temperature change cursed by the AI.

04:20.410 --> 04:23.580
I reminded the direction is one of our arguments here.

04:23.670 --> 04:28.100
So we will use that to compute the right temperature change coming from the AI.

04:28.320 --> 04:34.350
And so these two conditions will be on the sign of direction because I reminded direction takes two

04:34.350 --> 04:41.210
possible values plus one if the AI heats up the server and minus one if it cools down the server.

04:41.340 --> 04:46.980
And so the two conditions that we're going to add here to compute the delta of temperature cursed by

04:46.980 --> 04:49.990
the AA onto the server are going to be first.

04:50.100 --> 04:54.240
If direction equals minus one.

04:54.240 --> 05:00.780
That is if the AI cools down the server won that case we're going to introduce a new variable which

05:00.780 --> 05:07.020
we're going to call the delta temperature cursed by the AI onto the server.

05:07.110 --> 05:12.250
And how can we get easily this temperature things to this direction here.

05:12.300 --> 05:16.100
And of course the energy spent by the AI onto the server.

05:16.290 --> 05:22.560
Well remember assumption too which says that the energy spent by the AI is equal to the absolute value

05:22.560 --> 05:28.770
of the temperature change caused by the AI onto the server and therefore since direction equals minus

05:28.770 --> 05:29.550
one year.

05:29.580 --> 05:34.530
That means that the AI is cooling down the server and therefore the temperature change that is the delta

05:34.740 --> 05:39.150
temperature caused by the eye onto the server is a negative temperature change.

05:39.150 --> 05:43.480
And that's why it will be equal to minus energy.

05:43.830 --> 05:51.020
Energy spent by the air onto the server at that specific iteration when we are dead the environment.

05:51.320 --> 05:51.830
All right.

05:51.840 --> 05:56.470
And now the other condition which we have with live.

05:56.640 --> 06:04.620
So if this time the direction of temperature change course by the ice is equal to plus 1 then in that

06:04.620 --> 06:13.830
case the delta temperature change cursed by the eye onto the server is going to be equal to of course.

06:13.830 --> 06:20.430
Plus energy AI because indeed the direction is plus one that means that heats up the server and therefore

06:20.430 --> 06:22.700
the temperature change is a positive value.

06:22.920 --> 06:29.070
And based on assumption that positive values equal to the energy spent and therefore the delta temperature

06:29.320 --> 06:35.760
caused by the eye onto the answer is exactly equal to the energy spent by that AI on the server at that

06:35.760 --> 06:38.660
specific time to one of the environment.

06:38.670 --> 06:43.350
All right perfect so we get now the delta temperature caused by the AI.

06:43.500 --> 06:50.500
And so we were ready to get well the new servers temperature when there is AI there is a new surface

06:50.520 --> 06:57.900
temperature right up to the I place the action to regulate the surface temperature because indeed that

06:58.020 --> 07:06.780
news service temperature for which the variable is self that temperature AI which Kirby here is going

07:06.780 --> 07:16.590
to be of course that same temperature of disarray when we have the eye plus the delta of intrinsic temperature

07:16.830 --> 07:24.640
that is independently of the AI system plus the delta of temperature cast by the AI onto the server.

07:24.870 --> 07:31.530
Right so what I'm going to do now is just get these two deltas which are the two deltas basically updating

07:31.770 --> 07:38.290
the surface temperature and I'm going to add them to my previous temperature of the silver one we have

07:38.300 --> 07:44.010
the AI just before we have dated the environment right.

07:44.160 --> 07:49.140
Here we go the new temperature of the spring when we have the eye is equal to that same temperature

07:49.470 --> 07:57.240
plus the delta of intrinsic temperature plus the change of temperature coming from the eye and perfect.

07:57.240 --> 08:00.910
That gives us the third element of this next date.

08:00.930 --> 08:04.640
And we just managed to get the full next date.

08:04.740 --> 08:11.040
However we have a one final step here which we have to do because we're keeping track of the surface

08:11.040 --> 08:17.010
temperature in the other simulation that follows the same evolution of the intrinsic temperature which

08:17.010 --> 08:20.620
is of course the surface temperature when there is no AI.

08:20.700 --> 08:26.010
But I'm including that here even if this is not about getting the next date but I'm including that here

08:26.010 --> 08:29.910
because the update computation is very easy indeed.

08:29.970 --> 08:35.320
The new temperature in the separate simulation when we have no AI.

08:35.500 --> 08:45.160
So here no AI is going to be equal to that same temperature plus this time only the Delta intrinsic

08:45.340 --> 08:52.450
temperature because indeed we variety of data it the temperature change coming from that alternative

08:52.450 --> 08:54.440
system onto the server.

08:54.550 --> 09:01.750
Remember we computed that right here because we need it to compute the energy spent by this alternative

09:01.750 --> 09:05.540
system when we have no AI we needed to compute that for the reward.

09:05.650 --> 09:10.430
And at the same time we updated the temperature of the server when we have no AI.

09:10.450 --> 09:15.760
So this was already abated here and that's why here we only have to add the Delta intrinsic temperature

09:15.760 --> 09:22.510
and that's where we see really the common part of our two separate simulations following the temperature

09:22.660 --> 09:24.130
of the server when we have the.

09:24.160 --> 09:29.860
And when we have no AI we clearly see that here because indeed both these temperatures follow the same

09:29.860 --> 09:34.550
evolution of the intrinsic temperature of the surface.

09:34.780 --> 09:35.970
That's very important.

09:36.040 --> 09:41.560
Otherwise running these two separate simulations wouldn't make any sense to compare the performance

09:41.560 --> 09:48.150
of our AI with respect to the alternative system that is to servers integrate cooling system.

09:48.160 --> 09:49.300
All right perfect.

09:49.300 --> 09:50.240
Congratulations.

09:50.240 --> 09:55.480
We're done with this new big step of our general AI framework.

09:55.480 --> 10:01.460
Now we are ready to move on to the next step which will be about getting whether the game is over.

10:01.630 --> 10:03.730
And again seek capital letters.

10:03.730 --> 10:07.600
This next step is a step of our general AI framework.

10:07.810 --> 10:10.490
So let's tackle this next tutorial.

10:10.540 --> 10:12.190
And until then enjoy AI.
