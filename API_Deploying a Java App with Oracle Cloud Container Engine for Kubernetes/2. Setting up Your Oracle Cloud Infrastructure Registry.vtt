00:00:01.435 --> 00:00:06.821
The Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry or OCIR is an Oracle-managed registry.

2
00:00:06.821 --> 00:00:09.905
This means that availability and scalability of the

3
00:00:09.905 --> 00:00:12.284
service are taken care of for you.

4
00:00:12.284 --> 00:00:15.997
Within the registry you will create repositories.

5
00:00:15.997 --> 00:00:19.730
Repositories exist in a specific region and tenancy

6
00:00:19.730 --> 00:00:22.056
and can be public or private.

7
00:00:22.056 --> 00:00:26.547
Typically the images in a repository are different versions of the same

8
00:00:26.547 --> 00:00:31.471
source image with each version identified by a Docker tag.

9
00:00:31.471 --> 00:00:33.690
Using the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry simplifies

10
00:00:33.690 --> 00:00:37.211
deployments to your clusters running on the Oracle Cloud

11
00:00:37.211 --> 00:00:39.901
Container Engine for Kubernetes.

12
00:00:39.901 --> 00:00:42.309
There are three main things that you'll need in order to

13
00:00:42.309 --> 00:00:45.336
push an image to your OCIR repository.

14
00:00:45.336 --> 00:00:45.512
First,

15
00:00:45.512 --> 00:00:48.393
the user that is pushing to the repository must be a member

16
00:00:48.393 --> 00:00:52.367
of a group with a policy that allows repo management such

17
00:00:52.367 --> 00:00:54.292
as the administrators group.

18
00:00:54.292 --> 00:00:54.684
Next,

19
00:00:54.684 --> 00:01:00.757
the image tag must follow a specific format to be accepted into the repository.

20
00:01:00.757 --> 00:01:01.097
Finally,

21
00:01:01.097 --> 00:01:04.904
you must get an auth token from your Oracle Cloud account in order to

22
00:01:04.904 --> 00:01:08.987
perform a Docker login before pushing your image.

23
00:01:08.987 --> 00:01:12.009
We're going to cover the details of each of these steps starting with

24
00:01:12.009 --> 00:01:17.497
getting an auth token and checking permissions for your user.

25
00:01:17.497 --> 00:01:22.362
Log in to your Oracle Cloud console and select your user under your profile.

26
00:01:22.362 --> 00:01:27.169
Scroll down to Resources, then select Auth Tokens.

27
00:01:27.169 --> 00:01:30.426
Give the token a description, then click Generate Token.

28
00:01:30.426 --> 00:01:34.681
Be sure to copy the token, as you will not see it again.

29
00:01:34.681 --> 00:01:40.038
If you do forget your token, you can always delete it and generate a new one.

30
00:01:40.038 --> 00:01:42.954
I'm going to keep this one for now, then I'll delete it when we're done.

31
00:01:42.954 --> 00:01:46.573
The other permission to check for your user is under Groups.

32
00:01:46.573 --> 00:01:50.115
This will list all of the groups that your user belongs to.

33
00:01:50.115 --> 00:01:54.482
If you are a member of the Administrators group then you have the

34
00:01:54.482 --> 00:01:57.146
necessary permissions to upload an image to the repository,

35
00:01:57.146 --> 00:02:00.989
then deploy it to your Kubernetes cluster.

36
00:02:00.989 --> 00:02:02.747
If you are not a member of the Administrators group,

37
00:02:02.747 --> 00:02:09.000
then you'll need to make sure that you belong to a group with the necessary permissions.
