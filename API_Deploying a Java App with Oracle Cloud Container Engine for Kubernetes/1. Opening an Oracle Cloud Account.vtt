Hi, this is Craig Golightly,

2
00:00:02.237 --> 00:00:08.277
and welcome to Deploying a Java App with Oracle Cloud Container Engine for

3
00:00:08.277 --> 00:00:11.787
Kubernetes; Setting Up a Cluster on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure.

4
00:00:11.787 --> 00:00:15.547
The Oracle Cloud Container Engine for Kubernetes is

5
00:00:15.547 --> 00:00:17.682
a managed Kubernetes service.

6
00:00:17.682 --> 00:00:22.191
In order to use this service, you'll need to open an Oracle Cloud account.

7
00:00:22.191 --> 00:00:24.459
We're going to walk through how to do that,

8
00:00:24.459 --> 00:00:28.483
as well as how to create a cluster, configure kubectl,

9
00:00:28.483 --> 00:00:32.991
and access the Kubernetes dashboard for your cluster running in the

10
00:00:32.991 --> 00:00:35.908
Oracle Cloud Container Engine for Kubernetes.

11
00:00:35.908 --> 00:00:39.694
Oracle Cloud has multiple regions and a variety of

12
00:00:39.694 --> 00:00:41.450
locations all around the world.

13
00:00:41.450 --> 00:00:45.419
This allows you to select the region that is the best

14
00:00:45.419 --> 00:00:47.444
fit for your particular use case.

15
00:00:47.444 --> 00:00:51.993
You will need to select a region to host your Kubernetes cluster.

16
00:00:51.993 --> 00:00:56.320
In general, you'll want to select the region that is closest to you.

17
00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.002
Before you open your Oracle Cloud account,

18
00:01:00.002 --> 00:01:02.347
you'll want to gather a few items of information that they will

19
00:01:02.347 --> 00:01:05.838
ask for in the process of opening that account.

20
00:01:05.838 --> 00:01:09.294
You'll need an email, username and password,

21
00:01:09.294 --> 00:01:14.139
name and address, as well as a mobile number that you have access to,

22
00:01:14.139 --> 00:01:17.620
because they will send a verification code that you will need to

23
00:01:17.620 --> 00:01:20.896
enter as part of the account opening process.

24
00:01:20.896 --> 00:01:23.445
You will also need to enter your credit card information,

25
00:01:23.445 --> 00:01:31.842
but don't worry; your card will not be charged unless you upgrade your account.

26
00:01:31.842 --> 00:01:36.804
Let's go to oracle.com /cloud/free/ and walk through opening an

27
00:01:36.804 --> 00:01:39.662
Oracle Cloud account so you can see how that works.

28
00:01:39.662 --> 00:01:46.154
Go to oracle.com /cloud/free/ and select Start for free.

29
00:01:46.154 --> 00:01:50.665
Enter your email, country, and select Next.

30
00:01:50.665 --> 00:01:54.287
Select personal or company use, give your cloud account a name,

31
00:01:54.287 --> 00:01:57.276
then select the home region you would like to use.

32
00:01:57.276 --> 00:01:59.627
This can be any of the regions across the world,

33
00:01:59.627 --> 00:02:04.209
but in general, you'll want to select the one that is closest to you.

34
00:02:04.209 --> 00:02:08.931
Next, enter your name and address information, then your mobile number.

35
00:02:08.931 --> 00:02:09.737
At this point,

36
00:02:09.737 --> 00:02:13.638
they will send a verification to your mobile number so be sure you have

37
00:02:13.638 --> 00:02:18.098
access to that device so that you can get the code.

38
00:02:18.098 --> 00:02:19.417
Be sure to enter the code quickly,

39
00:02:19.417 --> 00:02:21.827
because you only have two minutes until it expires.

40
00:02:21.827 --> 00:02:25.863
Once you've verified the code, you can then create your password.

41
00:02:25.863 --> 00:02:28.385
There are various requirements for your password and

42
00:02:28.385 --> 00:02:31.606
they'll let you know if you miss something.

43
00:02:31.606 --> 00:02:33.839
Finally, you'll add the credit card details.

44
00:02:33.839 --> 00:02:39.580
Again, you won't be charged unless you elect to upgrade the account.

45
00:02:39.580 --> 00:02:43.733
Finally, you can review the terms and conditions, then complete your sign-up.

46
00:02:43.733 --> 00:02:45.407
Once the account is created,

47
00:02:45.407 --> 00:02:48.977
you'll be able to sign in using the username and password

48
00:02:48.977 --> 00:02:56.000
you created when you set up the account. Once you can see the dashboard, you know that you're good to go.
