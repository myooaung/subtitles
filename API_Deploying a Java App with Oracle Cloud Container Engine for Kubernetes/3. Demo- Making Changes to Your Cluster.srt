1
00:00:02,338 --> 00:00:05,916
Let's walk through how to handle some common changes.

2
00:00:05,916 --> 00:00:09,624
First, we'll change the number of pods in the deployment.

3
00:00:09,624 --> 00:00:14,171
Next, we'll update the app and push a new Docker image to the repository.

4
00:00:14,171 --> 00:00:19,537
Finally, we'll deploy that new image to the running Kubernetes cluster.

5
00:00:19,537 --> 00:00:26,508
Let's edit the deployment and change the number of pods from three to six.

6
00:00:26,508 --> 00:00:31,589
Under deployment spec, change the replicas from three to six,

7
00:00:31,589 --> 00:00:35,023
then save and exit the file.

8
00:00:35,023 --> 00:00:36,537
Now there are six pods running.

9
00:00:36,537 --> 00:00:38,366
Notice the difference in age.

10
00:00:38,366 --> 00:00:41,344
Three of them have just started while the other three

11
00:00:41,344 --> 00:00:44,211
have been running for a while longer.

12
00:00:44,211 --> 00:00:46,957
If we hit the cluster again, you can see several ones,

13
00:00:46,957 --> 00:00:49,808
twos, and threes starting to appear.

14
00:00:49,808 --> 00:00:53,667
These are requests that are being handled by the new pods.

15
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:57,997
The elevens, twelves, thirteens are the requests running on the older pods.

16
00:00:57,997 --> 00:01:01,983
Let's say there was a change to the application.

17
00:01:01,983 --> 00:01:06,492
Here we will simply change the message that is printed from Hello to Goodbye.

18
00:01:06,492 --> 00:01:10,593
This change has already been built into the demo.2 .0 .jar so we can

19
00:01:10,593 --> 00:01:14,340
go right to making a new Docker image with that.

20
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:21,761
Change the Docker file to copy demo- 2.0 .jar instead of demo.1 .0 .jar.

21
00:01:21,761 --> 00:01:25,891
Next, build a new Docker image based on that modified Docker file.

22
00:01:25,891 --> 00:01:30,069
Notice the new image id for the Docker image that was just created.

23
00:01:30,069 --> 00:01:34,693
Now let's tag this with 2.0 so that we know it contains

24
00:01:34,693 --> 00:01:38,290
the 2.0 version of the application.

25
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:41,820
Be sure to copy the image id so that you tag the correct image.

26
00:01:41,820 --> 00:01:47,478
Here I will tag the new image with a different tag, 2.0.

27
00:01:47,478 --> 00:01:53,057
Now we can push the new image up to the OCIR repository.

28
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:55,437
If we take a look at the registry on the web console,

29
00:01:55,437 --> 00:01:58,688
we can see the 2.0 image has been pushed.

30
00:01:58,688 --> 00:02:02,154
Now we'll change the deployment to specify that we

31
00:02:02,154 --> 00:02:06,153
want the 2.0 version of the image, not the 1.0 version.

32
00:02:06,153 --> 00:02:13,864
Under the spec for containers, change it from 1.0 to 2.0, save, and exit.

33
00:02:13,864 --> 00:02:19,041
When we hit the application, we can see the change from Hello to Goodbye.

34
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:20,859
Notice also that the numbers restarted,

35
00:02:20,859 --> 00:02:25,257
because this is a new instance of the application.

36
00:02:25,257 --> 00:02:26,599
When you're done with your cluster,

37
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,628
there's a couple of things to clean up to avoid any ongoing charges.

38
00:02:31,628 --> 00:02:33,065
When you delete the cluster,

39
00:02:33,065 --> 00:02:39,469
the node pool will also go away so you won't be charged for those machines.

40
00:02:39,469 --> 00:02:42,196
You can check the status of your nodes under Compute Instances

41
00:02:42,196 --> 00:02:46,496
and see the different states: Terminating,

42
00:02:46,496 --> 00:02:49,878
Terminated, or Running.

43
00:02:49,878 --> 00:02:51,219
Once the cluster is deleted,

44
00:02:51,219 --> 00:02:56,889
you'll also need to delete the VCN that was created with that cluster.

45
00:02:56,889 --> 00:03:00,088
Go to Networking, Virtual Cloud Networks,

46
00:03:00,088 --> 00:03:03,819
then select the VCN that was associated with the cluster that you deleted.

47
00:03:03,819 --> 00:03:10,188
Click Terminate, then Terminate All.

48
00:03:10,188 --> 00:03:19,004
The last item to clean up would be the repository in your registry.

49
00:03:19,004 --> 00:03:19,335
Congratulations!

50
00:03:19,335 --> 00:03:26,150
You can now deploy an image from your OCIR repository to your OKE cluster.

51
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:28,587
You can change the number of pods that are running in your app,

52
00:03:28,587 --> 00:03:31,257
and you can update your app that is running in Kubernetes

53
00:03:31,257 --> 00:03:38,000
by deploying a new image of your app. I hope you have found this valuable, and thank you for watching!
