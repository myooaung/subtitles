00:00:02.450 --> 00:00:06.697
Let's go to the Oracle Cloud console and create a policy with this statement,

2
00:00:06.697 --> 00:00:11.518
then quick create a Kubernetes cluster so you can see just how easy it is.

3
00:00:11.518 --> 00:00:17.497
From your Oracle Cloud console, go to the Governance and Administration section,

4
00:00:17.497 --> 00:00:20.313
then Identity, Policies.

5
00:00:20.313 --> 00:00:23.687
We're going to create a policy.

6
00:00:23.687 --> 00:00:29.295
Be sure to select the root compartment, as this is a tenancy-level configuration.

7
00:00:29.295 --> 00:00:31.668
Give the policy a name and a description,

8
00:00:31.668 --> 00:00:40.353
then add the statement, Allow service OKE to manage all-resources in tenancy.

9
00:00:40.353 --> 00:00:45.840
Select Create, then you can see that the policy was created.

10
00:00:45.840 --> 00:00:49.017
To quick create a cluster, go to the Solutions and Platform menu,

11
00:00:49.017 --> 00:00:53.427
then Developer Services, Container Clusters OKE.

12
00:00:53.427 --> 00:00:57.503
Select the compartment that you would like the cluster to be created in,

13
00:00:57.503 --> 00:00:59.503
then click Create Cluster.

14
00:00:59.503 --> 00:01:03.507
Give your cluster a name and be sure Quick Create is selected.

15
00:01:03.507 --> 00:01:07.607
The Kubernetes version will default to the latest so we'll just leave that.

16
00:01:07.607 --> 00:01:12.636
Select whether you want your worker nodes in a public or private subnet,

17
00:01:12.636 --> 00:01:18.852
then select the shape and number of nodes that you would like in your node pool.

18
00:01:18.852 --> 00:01:24.388
If you would like to be able to SSH into your nodes, you could enter a key here.

19
00:01:24.388 --> 00:01:27.025
You can also add any Kubernetes labels you would like

20
00:01:27.025 --> 00:01:29.809
here by providing key value pairs.

21
00:01:29.809 --> 00:01:34.816
By default, it will also enable the Kubernetes dashboard, as well as Tiller.

22
00:01:34.816 --> 00:01:35.976
Once you click Create,

23
00:01:35.976 --> 00:01:41.423
you can see each item that is being created for you in the quick-create process.

24
00:01:41.423 --> 00:01:44.730
These are the items in your tenancy that the

25
00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:46.629
service needed permission to create.

26
00:01:46.629 --> 00:01:49.438
The virtual cloud network, internet gateway,

27
00:01:49.438 --> 00:01:53.439
NAT gateway, route tables, security lists,

28
00:01:53.439 --> 00:01:54.979
and subnets.

29
00:01:54.979 --> 00:01:58.280
The cluster and node pool will take a little bit longer so

30
00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:00.504
let's close this and go to the dashboard.

31
00:02:00.504 --> 00:02:03.238
Here is the dashboard for your cluster.

32
00:02:03.238 --> 00:02:06.987
Notice under the status it says Creating.

33
00:02:06.987 --> 00:02:09.378
Right now it is creating the actual Kubernetes cluster with

34
00:02:09.378 --> 00:02:13.727
some parts being in Oracle tenancy like the Kubernetes master

35
00:02:13.727 --> 00:02:15.514
and underlying infrastructure,

36
00:02:15.514 --> 00:02:20.591
and some parts being in your tenancy like the node pool.

37
00:02:20.591 --> 00:02:21.429
Under node pool details,

38
00:02:21.429 --> 00:02:24.846
you can see the different availability domains and

39
00:02:24.846 --> 00:02:27.316
subnets where the nodes will be hosted.

40
00:02:27.316 --> 00:02:32.680
After a few minutes, you should see your cluster transition to the Active status.

41
00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:40.000
At this point, you can see all of the details about your cluster, as well as the nodes in the node pool.
