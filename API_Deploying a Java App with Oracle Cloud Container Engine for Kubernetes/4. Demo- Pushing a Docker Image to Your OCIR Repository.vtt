00:00:00.638 --> 00:00:03.269
Now it's time to try this out.

2
00:00:03.269 --> 00:00:06.036
We're going to go through docker login, docker tag,

3
00:00:06.036 --> 00:00:09.929
and docker push with the sample app to push that

4
00:00:09.929 --> 00:00:12.159
Docker image to your OCIR repository.

5
00:00:12.159 --> 00:00:16.064
We'll also view the registry in the Oracle Cloud web

6
00:00:16.064 --> 00:00:19.430
console so you know where to find that.

7
00:00:19.430 --> 00:00:22.108
Now we're ready to tag and upload the Docker image.

8
00:00:22.108 --> 00:00:25.102
If you don't still have your tenancy namespace,

9
00:00:25.102 --> 00:00:30.197
you can find it under Tenancy, Object Storage Settings,

10
00:00:30.197 --> 00:00:33.394
Object Storage Namespace.

11
00:00:33.394 --> 00:00:37.178
Do a Docker login to the region where you would like to push the Docker image.

12
00:00:37.178 --> 00:00:43.627
Your username is the tenancy namespace, slash, your Oracle Cloud username.

13
00:00:43.627 --> 00:00:48.278
Your password is the auth token that you generated from your account.

14
00:00:48.278 --> 00:00:51.280
You can configure your Docker credentials however

15
00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:54.743
you need to for your application.

16
00:00:54.743 --> 00:00:57.662
Here is the image that was built when we were trying out the application.

17
00:00:57.662 --> 00:01:03.202
Now we need to add the proper tag to that image.

18
00:01:03.202 --> 00:01:05.495
We'll run the docker tag command with the proper

19
00:01:05.495 --> 00:01:09.393
format that we discussed in the slides.

20
00:01:09.393 --> 00:01:15.247
Now the image has the expected name and tag so we can push it to the repository.

21
00:01:15.247 --> 00:01:16.511
Before we push the image,

22
00:01:16.511 --> 00:01:20.752
let's take a look at the registry in the Oracle Cloud console.

23
00:01:20.752 --> 00:01:26.770
Under Developer Services select Registry OCIR.

24
00:01:26.770 --> 00:01:29.807
Notice that no repositories have been created.

25
00:01:29.807 --> 00:01:36.082
When we push the image, it will automatically create a private repository.

26
00:01:36.082 --> 00:01:39.548
The image was successfully pushed to the repository.

27
00:01:39.548 --> 00:01:41.967
Let's take a look at it on the cloud console.

28
00:01:41.967 --> 00:01:48.361
When I refresh, we can see the repository was created and the image was pushed.

29
00:01:48.361 --> 00:01:49.453
From the cloud console,

30
00:01:49.453 --> 00:01:52.042
you can explore your repository and see metadata

31
00:01:52.042 --> 00:01:56.965
and statistics about your image.

32
00:01:56.965 --> 00:01:57.287
Congratulations!

33
00:01:57.287 --> 00:02:01.472
You can now log in to your Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry,

34
00:02:01.472 --> 00:02:04.161
tag a Docker image in the correct format,

35
00:02:04.161 --> 00:02:07.590
and push a Docker image to your OCIR repository.

36
00:02:07.590 --> 00:02:16.000
Join me in the next module to deploy the Docker image from your repository to your Oracle Container Engine Kubernetes cluster.
