00:00:01.586 --> 00:00:05.602
To access the Kubernetes dashboard, you'll need to do a couple more things.

2
00:00:05.602 --> 00:00:09.448
Go down to Access Kubernetes Dashboard for your cluster.

3
00:00:09.448 --> 00:00:12.597
You've already created a kubeconfig file and verified

4
00:00:12.597 --> 00:00:14.829
that you could connect to your cluster.

5
00:00:14.829 --> 00:00:19.687
Next, they've provided the information for you to create a service account.

6
00:00:19.687 --> 00:00:24.965
Go ahead and copy this information, then add it to a YAML file on your system.

7
00:00:24.965 --> 00:00:25.427
Next,

8
00:00:25.427 --> 00:00:30.189
run kubectl apply -f and the name of the file you

9
00:00:30.189 --> 00:00:31.956
just created with that information.

10
00:00:31.956 --> 00:00:35.856
You should see a confirmation that the service account was created.

11
00:00:35.856 --> 00:00:41.363
Next, you need to get the secret in order to log into the Kubernetes dashboard.

12
00:00:41.363 --> 00:00:42.898
If you need a reminder,

13
00:00:42.898 --> 00:00:47.136
you can access all of these commands from your cloud console

14
00:00:47.136 --> 00:00:50.797
in the Access Kubernetes Dashboard section.

15
00:00:50.797 --> 00:00:52.989
Copy the token that it shows and set that aside; you're

16
00:00:52.989 --> 00:00:55.500
going to need it in just a minute.

17
00:00:55.500 --> 00:00:59.880
Run kubectl proxy to start up a proxy between your machine and the cluster,

18
00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:03.839
then open your browser to the location shown in the resources.

19
00:01:03.839 --> 00:01:06.113
You should see a login prompt.

20
00:01:06.113 --> 00:01:10.824
Select Token, then paste the token that you copied just a minute ago.

21
00:01:10.824 --> 00:01:12.121
Click Sign In,

22
00:01:12.121 --> 00:01:15.584
and now you can access the Kubernetes dashboard for

23
00:01:15.584 --> 00:01:17.738
the cluster that you just created.

24
00:01:17.738 --> 00:01:21.755
I've already deployed something to this cluster so you can see the deployments,

25
00:01:21.755 --> 00:01:29.131
pods, and other things that you're used to seeing in the Kubernetes dashboard.

26
00:01:29.131 --> 00:01:30.045
Great job!

27
00:01:30.045 --> 00:01:32.550
You've created an Oracle Cloud account,

28
00:01:32.550 --> 00:01:36.799
you have a running Kubernetes cluster with kubectl access configured,

29
00:01:36.799 --> 00:01:40.576
and you're able to access your Kubernetes dashboard.

30
00:01:40.576 --> 00:01:47.000
Join me in the next module where we will look at pushing a Docker image to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Registry.
