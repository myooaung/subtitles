00:00:00.610 --> 00:00:07.400
Write in this lecture we're going to be going over how to create still life drawings from life now now

2
00:00:07.440 --> 00:00:09.890
drawing from life is extremely important.

3
00:00:09.930 --> 00:00:14.680
And we've already been over this but now we want to dedicate a whole section to drawn from life.

4
00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:17.880
Now why is drawn from life so important.

5
00:00:17.910 --> 00:00:22.890
Well drawn from life is really important because all of your artwork is going to be based off of real

6
00:00:22.890 --> 00:00:28.440
life whether you're drawing artwork that are objects from everyday life or you're creating your own

7
00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:30.440
worlds in fantasy worlds.

8
00:00:30.450 --> 00:00:33.320
You're still going to need to know how real life works.

9
00:00:33.420 --> 00:00:39.200
And the thing is everything cannot be proved and shown by using math formulas and rules.

10
00:00:39.210 --> 00:00:44.280
Sometimes you just have to actually look at objects and draw them exactly the way you see them until

11
00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.190
you understand how they work.

12
00:00:46.380 --> 00:00:49.170
And then you can become a great artist.

13
00:00:49.170 --> 00:00:55.450
So it is very important to draw a lot of objects from real life they have really good light on them

14
00:00:55.650 --> 00:01:03.190
so you can understand how lighting and how perspective and values and contrast and sheeps work.

15
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:05.050
It's the best way to learn.

16
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:08.610
So let's go ahead and get started with the basics of drawing from life.

17
00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:14.400
So the first thing that you need to know about drawn from life is you're trying to copy and mimic exactly

18
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.320
what you see.

19
00:01:15.510 --> 00:01:20.100
Now that's not to say that you can't make any small changes to make it look better but for the most

20
00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:24.750
part you want to try to copy the exact shape the exact value of your object.

21
00:01:24.900 --> 00:01:29.260
So the first thing we're going to go over is take a measurement of your object.

22
00:01:29.370 --> 00:01:34.860
Well the way you do this is by taking your pencil and you're going to hold it in front of your object.

23
00:01:34.990 --> 00:01:35.310
OK.

24
00:01:35.340 --> 00:01:40.320
So we're going to hold this to about here and then what you want to do is you want to put your finger

25
00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:42.330
and mark where the end of your object is.

26
00:01:42.360 --> 00:01:47.490
Now you have that measurement of your object you want to make sure that your arm is completely and fully

27
00:01:47.490 --> 00:01:52.280
extended so that every time you take this measurement it's the same exact distance.

28
00:01:52.290 --> 00:01:54.730
So you get the same proportions if you don't.

29
00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.910
If I move this closer.

30
00:01:55.920 --> 00:01:58.850
Well now it changes and so it has to move my thumb to there.

31
00:01:58.860 --> 00:02:04.050
And so if I keep going back and forth and trying to take measurements of this fork but from different

32
00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:08.700
distances away from my eyes then that's going to mess up my measurements.

33
00:02:08.700 --> 00:02:13.490
You want to make sure that every time that you have your arm extended all the way out.

34
00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:15.690
So it's the same every time.

35
00:02:15.900 --> 00:02:19.500
Once you get that measurement then what you're going to do is you're going to go ahead and take this

36
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:24.360
measurement on your pencil and you can lay it down on your paper and then using a second pencil you

37
00:02:24.360 --> 00:02:27.680
can go ahead and mark from one end to the other.

38
00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:30.490
And now you know the distance for that object.

39
00:02:30.510 --> 00:02:36.030
Now depending on how close the object is that's going to determine how big your object will appear on

40
00:02:36.030 --> 00:02:37.030
your paper.

41
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:44.010
So right now it would be pretty small but if I were to get closer to my object you'll see that it becomes

42
00:02:44.010 --> 00:02:44.910
a lot bigger.

43
00:02:44.910 --> 00:02:51.120
I mean I can make it as big as my pencil and if I bring it all the way towards it you'll see that my

44
00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.890
pencil isn't even big enough to capture the whole force.

45
00:02:54.330 --> 00:02:57.540
So that's also a really important thing is how close is your object.

46
00:02:57.540 --> 00:03:02.430
The closer it is the larger it'll be on your paper The further away it is and the smaller it's going

47
00:03:02.430 --> 00:03:02.760
to be.

48
00:03:02.790 --> 00:03:09.470
So if I bring my pencil all the way up to here my fork is very small.

49
00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:13.130
Now I bring this back you'll see my fork has a very short distance.

50
00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:15.520
Now if I were to mark that on my paper.

51
00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.240
So you're going to take some basic measurements when you're drawing from still life.

52
00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:24.680
You're probably going to take the width of your object and then you're also going to take the height

53
00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:25.430
of your object.

54
00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:29.780
So I would take the height of my object just like so.

55
00:03:29.940 --> 00:03:34.390
And I want to take the tallest part my object which is this part of the fork.

56
00:03:34.450 --> 00:03:39.340
So once you've taken your measurements of your object you're going to go ahead and transfer those measurements

57
00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:41.650
onto your paper money on your paper.

58
00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:47.020
You're going to go ahead and start sketching within those guidelines which are your measurement lines.

59
00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:48.540
And then you can work from there.

60
00:03:48.550 --> 00:03:53.080
The point of taking the measurements is to make sure that you get the correct proportions throughout

61
00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.500
your entire time.

62
00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:59.230
Now let's have a look at the three basic types of drawing techniques.

63
00:03:59.230 --> 00:04:02.890
When it comes to creating an still life drawings.

64
00:04:02.890 --> 00:04:07.230
So the first one is called cross-hatching.

65
00:04:07.270 --> 00:04:08.920
So what is crosshatching.

66
00:04:08.980 --> 00:04:15.970
Well cross-hatching is a very popular way to create sketches and what it is is it's very similar to

67
00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.890
drawing with cross concrete lines.

68
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:22.540
The only difference is that these lines will cross each other in different directions.

69
00:04:22.540 --> 00:04:26.740
So for example let's go ahead and add some shading to our sphere.

70
00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:33.250
So I'm going to start off by adding my crosscountry in for my main shadow which is going to be my core

71
00:04:33.250 --> 00:04:52.460
shadow.

72
00:04:52.780 --> 00:04:55.990
The next what on to do is add some crosshatching lines in there.

73
00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:58.920
So crosshatching lines are just going to cross with these lines.

74
00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:02.830
And the more they cross the darker it's going to create the illusion of value.

75
00:05:02.850 --> 00:05:08.550
So I'm going to go ahead and add some crosshatching in for my course shadow

76
00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:13.060
like so.

77
00:05:13.100 --> 00:05:15.150
Another area appears to be darker.

78
00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:20.340
I can even add in a skinnier line of that crosshatching right through the middle of that to darken the

79
00:05:20.340 --> 00:05:22.430
middle of my core shadow.

80
00:05:23.010 --> 00:05:26.540
And then I can even add another layer layer of crosshatching in.

81
00:05:26.550 --> 00:05:32.970
So dirt in this area to also help blend it into my highlight

82
00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.810
it then we can go ahead and add in our cast shadows and go ahead and sketch the sheep and my cat shadow

83
00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:54.330
and then to create or cash out so we can just add in some diagonal lines like so and then we'll do the

84
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:58.270
same theme coming in the other direction because this is cross-hatching.

85
00:05:58.290 --> 00:06:02.250
So basically all cross-hatching is is crossing lines that create Vagas.

86
00:06:02.250 --> 00:06:07.680
The more you cross them and the darker the lines the more value or the darker the value is going to

87
00:06:07.680 --> 00:06:08.460
be.

88
00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:13.140
Now let's go ahead and move on to our next type of drawing technique.

89
00:06:13.170 --> 00:06:17.270
Now there are other drawing techniques besides these ones but these are the most commonly used ones.

90
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:21.420
And so we're only going to be going over these ones now blending is something that we've used up to

91
00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.340
this point.

92
00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:28.080
And so what blending is is it's basically just layering in your values.

93
00:06:28.110 --> 00:06:30.380
So we start with a lighter value.

94
00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:37.370
Then we start to introduce a darker value.

95
00:06:38.570 --> 00:06:45.700
And we just start layering in darker and darker values and we try to blend these in by pushing a little

96
00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:47.660
bit harder as we get to the other value.

97
00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:49.680
So it can slowly blend into the next one.

98
00:06:49.690 --> 00:06:55.150
So our darker value blends into lighter value and then our value blends into our highlight

99
00:07:02.050 --> 00:07:06.970
how this process can take a little while but it can also look very good.

100
00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:37.130
So now that I have my mid-tone shadow in there I can go ahead and add in my core shadow something to

101
00:07:37.130 --> 00:07:43.080
go ahead and added in like so inserting a little bit lighter and will continue to darken that core shadow

102
00:07:43.340 --> 00:07:48.230
but we just want to make sure that we're blending those two values together very well.

103
00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:51.880
And we do that by drawing very lightly and in layers.

104
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:22.260
All right now let's go ahead and add in the cash shadow so go ahead and draw that shape and we can slowly

105
00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:23.340
add in that value.

106
00:08:23.340 --> 00:08:27.960
And I want it to fade out as we get to this and some of the slowly add in my first light value then

107
00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:32.520
I'll add in a little bit darker value and a little and a little bit sooner and then I'll go ahead and

108
00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:35.040
added my last value.

109
00:08:35.040 --> 00:08:39.410
So in so now I have a nice blend between all those values.

110
00:08:39.410 --> 00:08:39.840
All right.

111
00:08:39.870 --> 00:08:42.140
Now let's go ahead and move on to the last one.

112
00:08:42.150 --> 00:08:46.410
So the last drawing style is called rendering and what rendering is.

113
00:08:46.420 --> 00:08:52.590
It's basically starting out with a neutral value for background and then we draw and create highlights

114
00:08:52.590 --> 00:08:53.460
on top of that.

115
00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.650
So let me show you what I mean.

116
00:08:54.840 --> 00:09:01.400
So what we'll do is we'll go ahead and lately put in a nice mid gray background.

117
00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:21.520
Just like so then we're going to go ahead and grab every racer and we're going to race away our highlight.

118
00:09:21.520 --> 00:09:27.930
So it is going to be summer about here and make sure you don't do too dark of a background otherwise

119
00:09:27.930 --> 00:09:29.130
you're going to have a hard time.

120
00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:39.660
You Racinet.

121
00:09:40.070 --> 00:09:42.000
So now we have our highlighted area.

122
00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.550
Go ahead and blend that in just a little bit more so that we can go ahead and add in some darker areas.

123
00:09:47.600 --> 00:09:51.880
So I might add in my core shadow right along here.

124
00:10:13.190 --> 00:10:18.560
Basically what we're doing is we're starting out with a mid neutral color which is our gray background.

125
00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:24.200
And from there we're going in and we're finding where our object is and we're creating it by adding

126
00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:26.120
in highlights and dark shadows.

127
00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:47.690
But we already have our mid-tone because our entire drawing is covered with our mid-tone.

128
00:10:47.890 --> 00:10:48.460
All right great.

129
00:10:48.460 --> 00:10:54.610
Now let's go ahead and add in our cast shadow so go ahead and sketch that shapen and I'll go ahead and

130
00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:00.170
Anadin just like so.

131
00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:03.850
And so that's rendering.

132
00:11:03.850 --> 00:11:07.310
Now there are other places for you to use rendering and would be a lot more effective.

133
00:11:07.390 --> 00:11:14.230
For example if you have great tone paper which is just a mid-tone gray paper there could pencils that

134
00:11:14.230 --> 00:11:19.810
are called Prisma colors which you see me use a blue one in this course so far but these colored pencils

135
00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:22.410
allow you to draw on top of mid-tone colors.

136
00:11:22.420 --> 00:11:27.400
And so I could take a white colored pencil and draw on top of the gray paper and that would allow me

137
00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:33.310
to add in my highlights and then I can take a black colored pencil and add in my dark shadows and that

138
00:11:33.310 --> 00:11:39.760
mid-tone really neutralizes my piece of artwork and makes it a lot easier to create my drawing because

139
00:11:39.790 --> 00:11:44.980
I already have a mid-tone background so I don't have to worry about any of my midterms I have to worry

140
00:11:44.980 --> 00:11:47.970
about my shadows and my highlights.

141
00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.760
All right that brings us to the end of this election.

142
00:11:50.770 --> 00:11:56.560
So in this lecture we learned how to take measurements of a object from still life so that we can put

143
00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.120
them onto a paper and then sketch that.

144
00:12:00.190 --> 00:12:06.370
Next we learn the three basic sketch types that we'll be using to create our still life drawings.

145
00:12:06.370 --> 00:12:13.040
So the first one is crosshatching which is where you have cross country lines that cross with each other.

146
00:12:13.240 --> 00:12:18.200
So just down here in our cash shadow where we have criss crossing lines to create that dark value.

147
00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:20.350
Then the next one is blending.

148
00:12:20.350 --> 00:12:26.200
Blending is just where you lightly layer your values until they get darker and darker till you get to

149
00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.200
your darkest value.

150
00:12:27.220 --> 00:12:31.210
And that way you create that nice blend between all of your values.

151
00:12:31.330 --> 00:12:37.060
Then the last one is rendering where you start off with a neutral background which is a mid-tone gray.

152
00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.820
And then you erase out or add in your highlight and then you add in your dark shadows so you don't have

153
00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:45.000
to worry about your mid-tone colors.

154
00:12:45.490 --> 00:12:49.660
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one where we're

155
00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:55.540
going to draw a still life of a banana and some fabric and we're really going to start understanding

156
00:12:55.690 --> 00:12:59.710
how real life works through sketching from real life objects.
