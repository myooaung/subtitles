1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:06,720
All right in this lecture we're going to go ahead and create a landscape image using the knowledge we

2
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:09,770
learn about shapes and how to put them together.

3
00:00:10,170 --> 00:00:16,860
So first off I'm going to be using a blue pencil to create this under drawing and then I'm going to

4
00:00:16,860 --> 00:00:22,600
switch over to a darker pencil to do more of my detail work and to solidify the image.

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:24,670
So let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:24,750 --> 00:00:30,060
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to draw a horizontal line across my page.

7
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,010
Now this line is going to be my horizon line and it's OK if you don't know what a horizon line is.

8
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:39,590
We'll learn more about that later but for now we're just going to put that horizon line in there.

9
00:00:39,720 --> 00:00:45,150
Next I'm going to start adding in my mountains so my mountains are just going to be simple triangles

10
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:50,570
like we saw in our breakdown of that one image and it's all added on right there in there.

11
00:00:50,610 --> 00:00:56,760
And then I'll add a smaller one over here and you can really add in the mountains where ever you like.

12
00:00:56,760 --> 00:01:02,880
Next I'm going to add in a rectangle here and this rectangle is going to represent a tower that's going

13
00:01:02,880 --> 00:01:04,090
to be in my landscape.

14
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:07,900
But for now the basic shape for that tower is just a rectangle.

15
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,810
We're just trying to get the composition laid out and all those basic shapes.

16
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:15,520
Next I'm going to add in an oval and then I'll add in the second Oval.

17
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:20,020
Or they can be called ellipses and these are going to be a lake.

18
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:26,280
So for now the simple shape for them is just going to be a circle in perspective.

19
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:32,020
Next I'm going to start adding detail to this and turning these shapes into more organic shapes.

20
00:01:32,130 --> 00:01:38,610
So I'll start by first adding a little bit more of movement to the edges of these lines and I'm going

21
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:40,920
to add a edge to this mountain also.

22
00:01:43,990 --> 00:01:46,550
And I'll add a little bit more detail to that edge.

23
00:01:46,990 --> 00:01:53,330
So we just want to start making these look a lot more organic and less like geometrical shapes.

24
00:01:53,450 --> 00:01:56,860
Now I'm going to add an edge to this mountain as well.

25
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:01,760
And might add some more organic shapes to that.

26
00:02:01,780 --> 00:02:09,880
Now we can move on to our tower so the tower is just going to taper off towards the top and then add

27
00:02:09,880 --> 00:02:14,570
a nice rounded edge here at the top we will be sort of a platform.

28
00:02:14,590 --> 00:02:17,700
And then on top of that platform I want to add in a sphere.

29
00:02:17,710 --> 00:02:22,410
So I'm going to draw a circle up there next.

30
00:02:22,420 --> 00:02:23,520
Let's move on to the lake.

31
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:32,960
So now I want to connect these two ovals together to make the shape of my lake.

32
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:42,170
Now we want to add in the reflections into the lake.

33
00:02:42,310 --> 00:02:48,530
So what I'm doing is I'm copying the image of my tower in my mountains so that they're mirrored underneath

34
00:02:48,530 --> 00:02:52,110
my horizon line and then whatever appears inside of my lake.

35
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:54,110
That's what I'm going to go in and it darkens.

36
00:02:54,110 --> 00:02:55,790
Everything else is going to stay really light.

37
00:02:55,790 --> 00:03:00,730
We don't really want to see that but anything that's inside of the lake can go ahead and Durkan that

38
00:03:01,130 --> 00:03:08,060
so that I to add an edge on the mountain and then I'll add and darken edges of my tower perfect

39
00:03:11,410 --> 00:03:16,960
now I'm going to start using my darker pencil and I'll go in there and start adding in a lot more detail.

40
00:03:17,420 --> 00:03:20,210
So I'm just going to darken in a lot of these edges.

41
00:03:25,070 --> 00:03:29,260
I can darken the edge of my mountain so it's going to have two different planes.

42
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:34,390
We go in there and add some shadows to it it's going to make it look a lot more realistic.

43
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:36,260
And this edge right here

44
00:03:46,570 --> 00:03:52,420
and really the key to making things organic is kind of giving them a random sort of a shape.

45
00:03:52,440 --> 00:03:56,660
So you want to make it look as random as possible and try to stay away from patterns.

46
00:03:56,680 --> 00:03:57,960
Now I'm out here on the horizon line.

47
00:03:57,970 --> 00:04:05,670
I'm going to add in sort of some grass lines just to break it up so it's not such a hard edged line.

48
00:04:05,890 --> 00:04:09,530
I'm going to go ahead and do that all the way across my horizon line.

49
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,230
If you wanted to you could also add some trees to the horizon line you could add some bushes or some

50
00:04:14,350 --> 00:04:15,450
larger plants.

51
00:04:15,700 --> 00:04:17,490
But for now just keep things simple.

52
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:33,780
I'm just going to add in this grass.

53
00:04:33,890 --> 00:04:34,440
All right.

54
00:04:34,580 --> 00:04:38,220
Next let's go ahead and move onto this tower.

55
00:04:38,390 --> 00:04:41,660
So I'm just going to start targeting these edges.

56
00:04:46,940 --> 00:04:52,190
I might go ahead and add that detail to my sphere and I think I'll soon add two points to the top of

57
00:04:52,190 --> 00:04:52,570
here.

58
00:04:52,580 --> 00:04:55,690
It'll kind of be sort of Lord Of The Rings type of Tower.

59
00:04:56,060 --> 00:05:01,610
Then I'll add a tiny little door down here at the bottom and then I'll add some windows at the top as

60
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:03,990
you can see they're just extremely simple shapes.

61
00:05:04,010 --> 00:05:07,750
You don't have to get too detailed with it to get the idea across.

62
00:05:07,760 --> 00:05:10,010
Now let's go ahead and move on to our lake.

63
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,960
So we want to darken in the edge of our lake so we know where that edge is.

64
00:05:15,350 --> 00:05:22,050
So this is our contouring line.

65
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,840
Next we're going to go ahead and add in those reflections.

66
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,710
So go ahead and darken the edge of that tower and remember it's only going to be what's within the shape

67
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:33,380
of our lake.

68
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,990
Anything outside of that shape.

69
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:36,630
We're going to leave out

70
00:05:43,330 --> 00:05:50,980
great Next what we want to do is we want to start adding in some cross country lines to add more detail

71
00:05:51,000 --> 00:05:52,060
and realism to this.

72
00:05:52,060 --> 00:05:58,090
So Mr. appear at the top of my mountain and as you can see I'm adding the straight contour lines that

73
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:01,910
are showing the surface planes of my mountain.

74
00:06:02,050 --> 00:06:07,780
And so depending on what direction my cross-country lines are going that's kind of telling you where

75
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:09,440
that plane is in perspective

76
00:06:15,510 --> 00:06:17,100
an art onto this mountain

77
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:32,410
then I can add a little bit more detail over here.

78
00:06:32,410 --> 00:06:37,660
So add a little bit of crosscountry there and a little bit here will break this piece of the mountain

79
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:41,690
up also also perfect.

80
00:06:41,700 --> 00:06:50,440
Now let's add some cross contouring to our tower.

81
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:59,320
So since this is a round cylinder tower we're going to go ahead and add it like so so it has a nice

82
00:06:59,320 --> 00:07:01,930
curve in there.

83
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:13,140
And then we're going to go ahead and add that into our refl..

84
00:07:13,670 --> 00:07:17,350
Now we also want to add the cross contouring into the reflection of our mountain

85
00:07:21,450 --> 00:07:21,840
next.

86
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,690
Let's go ahead and add in sort of a darker gradient in our sky.

87
00:07:36,590 --> 00:07:40,110
This is just going to make our background look a little bit more interesting and you'll see here in

88
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:45,220
a second we're going to add this into our reflection in our water and it's going to make a reflection

89
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:51,730
look a lot more realistic and you'll see why in a second.

90
00:07:52,670 --> 00:07:56,030
So now we can go ahead and add that into the reflection of our water

91
00:07:58,830 --> 00:08:01,430
so we're going to add that in like so.

92
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:10,060
And what this does is it makes her legs stand out a lot more from the grassy plain area of already drawn.

93
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,710
All right.

94
00:08:11,730 --> 00:08:13,760
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

95
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:19,590
So in this lecture you learn how to apply the things we learned about shapes and how to put them together

96
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,560
to build up an entire image.

97
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,240
I really hope enjoyed this tutorial and you learn something from it.

98
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:29,250
And I really look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.

99
00:08:29,250 --> 00:08:29,880
Thanks for watching.
