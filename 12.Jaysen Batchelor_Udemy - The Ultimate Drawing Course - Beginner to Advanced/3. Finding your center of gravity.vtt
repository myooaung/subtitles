00:00:00.230 --> 00:00:06.100
Or write in this lecture we're going to go over something called the center line of Graben or the line

2
00:00:06.110 --> 00:00:07.250
of bounds.

3
00:00:07.350 --> 00:00:09.180
So let's go ahead and get started.

4
00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.280
So it's really important that you understand what the centerline of gravity is.

5
00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:16.330
Otherwise your characters are going to look in balance.

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.600
And what that means is it's going to look like they're about to topple over.

7
00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.490
Now maybe in some cases you actually want them to look like that.

8
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.160
But in most cases you want them to look like they're actually balanced.

9
00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:28.640
Now all these drawings right here are balanced.

10
00:00:28.830 --> 00:00:30.500
And let me show you how I know.

11
00:00:30.810 --> 00:00:35.190
So what you want to do to make sure that your character is balanced is you want to find a line so you're

12
00:00:35.190 --> 00:00:40.500
going to find a point right in the middle of the head and then you going to draw that line coming straight

13
00:00:40.500 --> 00:00:43.400
down all the way down to your feet.

14
00:00:43.410 --> 00:00:48.720
Now if this line is about in the middle or close to the middle of your two feet then that means your

15
00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:54.210
character is balanced because the weight is evenly dispersed between the two feet.

16
00:00:54.210 --> 00:00:55.050
Same with this one.

17
00:00:55.050 --> 00:01:00.030
So if we go ahead and draw a line comes straight down from this head all the way down to the feet.

18
00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:05.040
Now you'll notice that it's not in the middle is actually on one foot and all that means is that all

19
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:07.430
the weight is on this foot right here.

20
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:12.660
If I wanted to go ahead and pull his foot back to here it would still work because now the weight would

21
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:16.570
be evenly dispersed between the foot back here and the foot right here.

22
00:01:16.740 --> 00:01:23.640
So as long as the line is between the two feet or is over one foot that means that your character is

23
00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:24.610
balanced.

24
00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:29.490
Now let's have a look at some examples where the character is not balanced at all.

25
00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:31.220
So let's go ahead and sketch some things out.

26
00:01:31.260 --> 00:01:35.660
So if we do our head right here for example we're going to draw a straight line down.

27
00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:41.940
But now if I go ahead and draw the net coming off like so and I draw the chest area like so and the

28
00:01:41.940 --> 00:01:43.530
pelvis is right here.

29
00:01:43.890 --> 00:01:51.350
And then I have the legs coming off like so and they're standing over here.

30
00:01:51.930 --> 00:01:54.540
Well now they look like they're actually about to fall over.

31
00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.790
So if I had some arms in here

32
00:02:01.450 --> 00:02:06.360
and now kind of looks like they're waving their hands around because they're about to fall over because

33
00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:11.250
this line of balance or this line of gravity is not lined up with their feet and so they have nothing

34
00:02:11.250 --> 00:02:12.640
balancing them.

35
00:02:13.470 --> 00:02:16.100
Let's have a look at another imbalance drawing.

36
00:02:16.110 --> 00:02:21.960
So let's say that we have somebody running.

37
00:02:23.730 --> 00:02:29.520
So this is a very simple drawing of somebody running it's not extremely accurate but I just wanted to

38
00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.890
get this point across.

39
00:02:37.630 --> 00:02:37.960
All right.

40
00:02:37.960 --> 00:02:39.110
So here's somebody running.

41
00:02:39.190 --> 00:02:40.720
There's the floor right there.

42
00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:45.570
And if we draw a line coming straight down for this head it is lined up with his foot but his foot is

43
00:02:45.640 --> 00:02:46.890
on this floor surface.

44
00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:51.910
And so it's not really bent because gravity is going to end up pushing him down because his foot isn't

45
00:02:51.910 --> 00:02:53.290
touching water.

46
00:02:53.590 --> 00:02:57.860
Now what's happening here is that he's actually falling forward when he's running.

47
00:02:57.880 --> 00:03:01.430
When you run you fall forward even when you walk you're falling forward.

48
00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.330
And so actually if you draw somebody walking or running in action you're actually not going to get very

49
00:03:07.330 --> 00:03:08.420
good balance and you're drawn.

50
00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:09.610
Which is OK.

51
00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:12.670
You only want balance when the person is standing.

52
00:03:12.790 --> 00:03:16.230
But in this case there's no balance because he's falling forward.

53
00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.440
But then he's going to put his foot out eventually and catch himself over here and I'll continue to

54
00:03:20.440 --> 00:03:22.570
do this as long as he's running.

55
00:03:22.570 --> 00:03:27.010
Now let's have a look at one example of somebody that is balanced.

56
00:03:27.070 --> 00:03:32.920
So if we wanted to we could have somebody standing here on one foot and we could have the other foot

57
00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:36.140
out like this.

58
00:03:37.410 --> 00:03:44.450
And then we have their body like so we can have them do some sort of cheapos.

59
00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:46.440
Go ahead put the head right there.

60
00:03:46.930 --> 00:03:50.190
Now this person is balanced even though they're only standing on one foot.

61
00:03:50.350 --> 00:03:54.180
We draw a line come straight down from the middle of the head all the way to the foot all the weight

62
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:55.050
is on that foot.

63
00:03:55.070 --> 00:03:57.100
And so it's considered balance.

64
00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:01.900
If you were trying to do this pose in real life and he felt on balance the only reason why you're unbalanced

65
00:04:01.930 --> 00:04:06.590
is because your head is moving out from the center of your foot.

66
00:04:06.700 --> 00:04:09.600
If it moves over here you're going to feel like you're in a fall over that side.

67
00:04:09.610 --> 00:04:13.660
And if it moves over here you're going to feel like you're going to fall over to that side.

68
00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:18.000
So take this into account when you're drawing your figures or your character designs.

69
00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:20.070
Want to make sure they look balanced.

70
00:04:20.260 --> 00:04:24.370
I've seen a lot of really good character designs but they look wrong because they look like they're

71
00:04:24.370 --> 00:04:25.590
about to topple over.

72
00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:31.000
So make sure that you study this and always draw a line through the center of the head all the way down

73
00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.610
to the feet to make sure that it looks balanced.

74
00:04:33.610 --> 00:04:39.050
So remember to make your character balanced the line needs either line up with one foot so that all

75
00:04:39.070 --> 00:04:45.340
the weight is on one foot or it needs to line up between the two feet so that the weight is evenly dispersed

76
00:04:45.340 --> 00:04:46.180
between them.

77
00:04:46.330 --> 00:04:51.760
If your line is lined up out here and your feet are clear over here then your character is going to

78
00:04:51.760 --> 00:04:57.010
look like he's about to fall over like we saw in this example your assignment for this lecture is to

79
00:04:57.010 --> 00:05:02.710
go ahead and find a photo of somebody that you think is balanced and then I want you to go ahead and

80
00:05:02.710 --> 00:05:04.420
draw the image of them.

81
00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:09.530
And now I want you to draw the line of gravity through them showing where they're balanced.

82
00:05:09.550 --> 00:05:13.690
Then I want you to find a photo of somebody that looks like they're about to fall over or if you need

83
00:05:13.690 --> 00:05:19.240
to you can even take a picture of yourself falling over and then I want you to draw the line of gravity

84
00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:22.490
through that image showing how they're imbalanced.

85
00:05:22.720 --> 00:05:27.070
Then if you want to you can go ahead and post that to the Q and A section of the Course or the Facebook

86
00:05:27.070 --> 00:05:27.730
group.

87
00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.450
This one you don't have to post but if you'd like to you can.

88
00:05:31.450 --> 00:05:35.610
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
