1
00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:04,770
In today's lecture I'm going to teach you how to draw the human eye.

2
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,450
So the first thing I want to show you is I want to show you how the human eye works.

3
00:00:09,450 --> 00:00:15,120
So up to this point we've drawn some ice except we still haven't really gone in-depth with how the human

4
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:17,400
eye works and what we're drawing.

5
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:22,980
So first off we're going to create a diagram of the human eyeball and then we're going to layer on the

6
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:24,270
human eye lid.

7
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:30,670
So first off we have the eyeballs so this circle I have drawn here is the sphere that makes up my eyeball.

8
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,170
Next what we have is we have what's called the iris.

9
00:00:34,170 --> 00:00:36,370
The iris is the color of the eyes.

10
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:44,900
Go ahead and draw a circle in like so and that's going to make up my iris.

11
00:00:44,910 --> 00:00:47,830
The next part of the eye is the pupil.

12
00:00:47,850 --> 00:00:51,420
So the pupil is a hole in the eye.

13
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:55,080
Now the reason why there is a hole in your eye is because this is where the light comes in and hits

14
00:00:55,080 --> 00:00:59,180
the back of your eyeball and basically tells your brain what to see.

15
00:00:59,190 --> 00:01:03,630
Now a lot of you are probably familiar with this but if you're not that's why I want to go over it.

16
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:10,710
Now the this is a muscle the iris opens and closes the pupil and the pupil can get bigger or smaller.

17
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:15,660
So the larger the pupil the more light it's going to be letting in and the smaller the pupil the less

18
00:01:15,710 --> 00:01:17,600
light it's going to be letting in.

19
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:22,140
Now pupils can be all different types of colors or sorry irises can be all different types of colors.

20
00:01:22,170 --> 00:01:28,390
They can be anywhere from green to blue to brown sometimes grey they can have little hints of gold and

21
00:01:28,420 --> 00:01:31,660
there's all different types of irises.

22
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:35,190
This other part of the eyeball is called the white of the eyeball.

23
00:01:35,190 --> 00:01:42,170
Another thing to understand is that the iris is generally flat on the eyeball and sometimes even indented.

24
00:01:42,300 --> 00:01:48,250
And so that might cause a little bit of show on the top side if the light is coming down from the top.

25
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:52,510
It's going to cause a little bit of shadow on the top side because it's indented.

26
00:01:52,710 --> 00:01:58,050
So if we have a look at our eyeball from a side view what we see is we see a ball but the front of it

27
00:01:58,050 --> 00:02:06,900
would be cut flat like so and that could possibly be barely indenting and then we have the hole for

28
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:13,230
our pupil which then comes into our eyeball and that's why the pupil appears to be black is because

29
00:02:13,230 --> 00:02:18,510
you're looking into basically a cave and no light is going into that cave at least hardly any light

30
00:02:18,510 --> 00:02:19,300
at all.

31
00:02:19,320 --> 00:02:24,690
The only light that's coming in is been focused by the lens in front of your eye so it's hitting a small

32
00:02:24,690 --> 00:02:26,220
spot in the back of your arm.

33
00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:32,670
So now that we have our eyeball drawn the next thing we need to add is the eyelids so the eyelids are

34
00:02:32,670 --> 00:02:36,390
basically just pieces of skin that are laid across the top

35
00:02:39,880 --> 00:02:46,840
of her eyeball and then he comes up like so and we don't have the top of the eyelid all the way back

36
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:48,850
here where the round part of the ball is.

37
00:02:48,910 --> 00:02:50,440
We have about half way in.

38
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,240
So that would be the top of our eyelid like so and then we have the bottom eyelid.

39
00:02:56,300 --> 00:02:59,770
So the bottom eyelid can come around like so.

40
00:02:59,780 --> 00:03:02,700
So you have to imagine like the skin is wrapping around the ball.

41
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:07,970
When you're drawing your eyelids and then you're going to have a little bit of a bottom eyelid and you

42
00:03:07,970 --> 00:03:11,600
don't have to make it this prominent but just for demonstration purposes on the draw that is really

43
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:12,620
strong.

44
00:03:12,950 --> 00:03:18,310
Another thing to know is the top eyelid will overlap the bottom isolate it right over here.

45
00:03:18,740 --> 00:03:20,660
Then we have what's called the tear duck.

46
00:03:20,660 --> 00:03:25,190
So this area right here that's the Teer duck and that's where your tears come from.

47
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:25,520
All right.

48
00:03:25,550 --> 00:03:30,770
Now let's go over a couple of different eyeshades because a lot of the times people will teach you how

49
00:03:30,770 --> 00:03:33,940
to draw eyes but it's a very generic type of eye.

50
00:03:34,160 --> 00:03:38,990
And there are actually lots of different shapes and it's what makes somebody look like themselves is

51
00:03:38,990 --> 00:03:41,800
that their eye is shaped the way it is.

52
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:47,050
So the first time I'm going to go over is called the almond eye shape.

53
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:50,170
So the all in shape is basically shaped like an omen.

54
00:03:50,270 --> 00:03:59,690
So we had in the Teer doc then I part of it is just going to be basically shaped like so very much like

55
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:01,200
an omen.

56
00:04:01,800 --> 00:04:07,560
And then we can go ahead and draw in our iris and pupil.

57
00:04:07,780 --> 00:04:11,200
Then we can add in our eyelid

58
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:17,860
a lot of the time the eyelet on the bottom is just going to be shadow and there's not really going to

59
00:04:17,860 --> 00:04:20,410
be a hard line like there is on the top.

60
00:04:20,620 --> 00:04:23,040
So there is our own shape.

61
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:29,170
Another type of eyeshade is the round eyes so the round eye is going to be very similar to the almond

62
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:31,780
shape except the bottom part of it is going to be different.

63
00:04:31,780 --> 00:04:33,340
So we come over.

64
00:04:33,340 --> 00:04:40,150
So just like we did with our home in shape high but rather than just coming down like this and making

65
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:43,480
an almond shape it's actually going to swoop down a bit more.

66
00:04:43,480 --> 00:04:48,220
So it's going to start off like the almond shape but then it's going to come down a little bit more

67
00:04:48,220 --> 00:04:57,900
like so and we're going to go ahead and add in our iris and then a pupil can add an Arctic duck.

68
00:04:57,940 --> 00:05:00,910
Now I'm going to go ahead and add in the island

69
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:14,030
gripped and we might add a little bit of this ledge of the island also.

70
00:05:14,030 --> 00:05:15,690
It's perfect.

71
00:05:15,940 --> 00:05:19,190
Next let's go ahead and move on to the ice that's cold.

72
00:05:19,240 --> 00:05:20,690
The hooded.

73
00:05:20,710 --> 00:05:25,440
Now the ice is basically can be like the rounded eye or the omen.

74
00:05:25,630 --> 00:05:29,370
It doesn't really matter what it is just what happens with the Browns.

75
00:05:29,560 --> 00:05:37,150
So for example if we go ahead and draw an arm in shape by.

76
00:05:37,450 --> 00:05:43,540
So now we can go ahead and drop the iris in the pupil.

77
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,610
Now before we draw in that island on the top what we want to do is we want to shape the brown and rather

78
00:05:49,610 --> 00:05:53,900
than the browbeating way up here it actually sags down over the aisle.

79
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,750
And so you don't get to see very much of that top eyelids so it's going to start right about down here

80
00:05:59,820 --> 00:06:05,090
and then it's going to sag over the aisle like so and then we're going to come all the way over and

81
00:06:05,090 --> 00:06:10,560
around and then we can go ahead and add in the eyelid on these edges where we can barely see it and

82
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:18,230
we can also add a little bit of shadow underneath there so that it can at this Bottom Eyelet in and

83
00:06:18,230 --> 00:06:24,430
large my iris just a little bit of bottom eyelid to that ledge.

84
00:06:24,470 --> 00:06:25,440
Perfect.

85
00:06:25,490 --> 00:06:27,630
So that's called the hooded I.

86
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:32,810
It's just wear at the top of the brow hangs down and sags over the eyelid.

87
00:06:32,810 --> 00:06:36,340
Next let's go over what's called the upturned art.

88
00:06:36,410 --> 00:06:42,830
So the upturned eye is very often used when Disney animators are creating girl characters and what it

89
00:06:42,830 --> 00:06:47,430
is is it's basically just the eye at a slanted angle.

90
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,320
So some people actually do have this type of ID.

91
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:59,380
So it's going to come up like so then it's going to come down like so Bielski it's kind of similar to

92
00:06:59,380 --> 00:07:00,370
the Almon die.

93
00:07:00,370 --> 00:07:04,480
The only differences is that rather than the wind going straight through or is obsolete now it's going

94
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,170
through a vertical line.

95
00:07:07,480 --> 00:07:10,000
So now we can go ahead and add in our pupil

96
00:07:14,710 --> 00:07:17,030
and her search pattern or iris.

97
00:07:17,040 --> 00:07:22,240
And then our pupil perfect and then we'll go ahead and add in

98
00:07:24,920 --> 00:07:33,010
or laid it on the top and we can add another layer on the bottom.

99
00:07:33,250 --> 00:07:37,130
Now the last one I want to go over is called the Monteux lid.

100
00:07:37,750 --> 00:07:42,310
So it's going to be very similar to the almond dye in the upturned.

101
00:07:42,370 --> 00:07:44,750
It's sort of a mix between the two.

102
00:07:44,950 --> 00:07:46,540
So let's go ahead and get started.

103
00:07:46,690 --> 00:07:51,400
So first off we start off with more of an up line like this like we do with our almond die.

104
00:07:51,700 --> 00:07:55,810
But then that kind of turns more into our upturned eyes.

105
00:07:55,810 --> 00:08:01,710
So it comes overling overlength so never to come down like this.

106
00:08:04,010 --> 00:08:05,320
Turducken.

107
00:08:05,940 --> 00:08:09,150
So you'll see the first half of it is very much like our own and die.

108
00:08:09,180 --> 00:08:15,010
But the back half of it is very much like her but it turned out that we can go ahead and add in our

109
00:08:15,140 --> 00:08:19,770
Iris and her pupil.

110
00:08:20,910 --> 00:08:26,100
And with this type of eye the eyelid actually hangs right down over like so.

111
00:08:26,130 --> 00:08:32,190
And you don't actually really see any of that eyelid line.

112
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:33,110
All right.

113
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:34,700
Great.

114
00:08:34,760 --> 00:08:38,620
Now let's go over how to create different expressions with pods.

115
00:08:38,630 --> 00:08:43,640
So first off let's talk about the placement of the iris.

116
00:08:43,670 --> 00:08:48,530
So the iris is a big part in telling your viewer how the person or the character is feeling.

117
00:08:48,530 --> 00:08:51,150
So if we go ahead and draw an ivory here

118
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:02,670
and we put our iris right here in the middle and we have covered just a little bit by the top eyelid

119
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:08,040
and not really at all by the bottom eyelid the character is going to look very neutral.

120
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,540
If we have it come down even covered a little bit by the bottom eyelid it'll still look pretty neutral.

121
00:09:13,710 --> 00:09:18,840
As long as the top and the bottom of the iris are covered your character will look pretty neutral and

122
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,330
it won't look very surprised or anything like that but let's see we want our character to look surprised

123
00:09:24,390 --> 00:09:25,050
or scared.

124
00:09:25,050 --> 00:09:29,800
Well what we can do is we can lift the top eyelid a little bit higher

125
00:09:35,160 --> 00:09:40,230
but the main thing that you want to do to make them look scared or surprised is you need to show the

126
00:09:40,230 --> 00:09:44,690
white of the eye or the top part of the iris with your eyelid.

127
00:09:44,700 --> 00:09:50,660
So we're going to bring our iris down like so so we can see a little bit of it top area.

128
00:09:52,290 --> 00:09:55,410
We can go ahead and add it in our pupil.

129
00:09:56,390 --> 00:10:00,030
But now our eye looks scared or even excited.

130
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:03,990
Now what if you wanted your eye to look really tired and droopy.

131
00:10:04,010 --> 00:10:10,250
Well basically what she would do is you'd go ahead and drop this eyelid much more past the top of your

132
00:10:10,250 --> 00:10:10,890
iris.

133
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:12,160
So let's go ahead and draw that in.

134
00:10:12,170 --> 00:10:19,580
So come in sort of like so and then we'd see a lot more of the actual eyelid itself.

135
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:27,730
We can go ahead and draw on the bottom eyelid then we can go ahead and drawing the iris.

136
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:30,420
And at the top half of it is going to be covered.

137
00:10:34,020 --> 00:10:39,190
But that gives us the illusion that our person is very tired or exhausted.

138
00:10:39,210 --> 00:10:45,920
We can also draw a sort of some lines underneath here to exaggerate the wrinkles underneath the eye.

139
00:10:45,930 --> 00:10:50,220
Now we can also change the expression of the eye with the eyebrows.

140
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:54,560
So for example with this iris here if I want to go ahead and add an eyebrow.

141
00:10:54,780 --> 00:10:59,450
And I really put it towards a down angle and it really close to my eye here.

142
00:10:59,620 --> 00:11:03,570
And I even have some of my brow come down over my eyelid.

143
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:11,160
So I'll go ahead and finish adding that I can go out in the hairs

144
00:11:16,180 --> 00:11:20,010
Well now that looks really angry with this guy over here.

145
00:11:20,060 --> 00:11:24,250
We can go ahead and make it look even more surprised by adding a very uplifted eye.

146
00:11:24,290 --> 00:11:29,700
So we're going to bring the eyebrow really high and this might be a little exaggerated but that's OK.

147
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:35,750
There's a very famous artist named Norman Rockwell and he was very famous for exaggerating how high

148
00:11:35,750 --> 00:11:40,400
up his character's eyebrows went and that made his paintings look much better.

149
00:11:40,430 --> 00:11:42,440
Because of that exaggeration.

150
00:11:42,440 --> 00:11:45,030
So now we can go ahead and and and the hair on the eyebrow

151
00:11:48,260 --> 00:11:55,850
can also show a lot more of the eyelid because it's been stretched out as it's lifted.

152
00:11:57,110 --> 00:12:01,970
And then with this irony here we can go ahead and make that look much more docile if we just add in

153
00:12:02,030 --> 00:12:10,600
a straight eyebrow just like so then we can go ahead and add in the hair on the eyebrows.

154
00:12:13,630 --> 00:12:16,360
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

155
00:12:16,360 --> 00:12:19,840
So in this lecture you learned how the eyeball works.

156
00:12:19,840 --> 00:12:25,140
So first off we have the eyeball itself which is also known as the white of the eye.

157
00:12:25,210 --> 00:12:31,360
Then we have the iris which is the colored muscle of the eye which pulls open the pupil and the pupil

158
00:12:31,420 --> 00:12:38,680
as we saw here in the side diagram is just a hole in the eyeball and it lets light into the actual inside

159
00:12:38,710 --> 00:12:44,250
or the cavernous part of the eyeball so that your eye can pick up the signal and send it to your brain.

160
00:12:44,380 --> 00:12:47,440
So really that black there is just a hole.

161
00:12:47,530 --> 00:12:53,290
Then we learn how to add it in our eyelids and how it's basically just skin wrapped around the ball

162
00:12:53,350 --> 00:12:54,400
itself.

163
00:12:54,490 --> 00:12:59,290
Then we learned that we need to add a tear duck in there and then after we learn how the eyeball works

164
00:12:59,350 --> 00:13:02,070
we learn how there are different shapes of eyes.

165
00:13:02,170 --> 00:13:05,260
Then we learn how to create different expressions with her eyes.

166
00:13:05,320 --> 00:13:12,670
BI How much of the iris we show and the shape of the eyelid We also learn that by shaping and positioning

167
00:13:12,730 --> 00:13:16,850
our eyebrows in the correct positions can create different expressions.

168
00:13:16,850 --> 00:13:22,390
Also I really hope you learn something from this lecture and I'm really excited to see you in the next

169
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:22,720
one.

170
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:25,500
Where we're going to learn how to draw the nose.
