1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,520
All right in this lecture we're going to go over for it and how to use it.

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:12,000
So what is forming for is just adding a three dimension to a to d object.

3
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,010
So for example let's draw a square.

4
00:00:15,010 --> 00:00:19,380
So this Square right here is A to D object.

5
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:23,140
It only has two dimensions but we can add a third dimension to that.

6
00:00:23,140 --> 00:00:27,690
Or at least the illusion of a third dimension by creating it into a cube.

7
00:00:27,700 --> 00:00:32,640
So to do that all we have to do is draw lines coming off of each corner like so.

8
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:35,920
No we just need to connect each one of those lines.

9
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:40,850
And now we have a simple isometric cube.

10
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:42,680
So we just added to that.

11
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:43,940
Let's try another shape.

12
00:00:43,940 --> 00:00:47,450
Let's say we wanted to create form in a cone.

13
00:00:47,540 --> 00:00:52,730
Well what we'd have to do is we need to first draw the base which is going to be an oval because this

14
00:00:52,730 --> 00:00:56,920
is going to be a circle base and it's going to be in perspective if we have a circle like this.

15
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,450
And we're looking at it from this view you see how it turns into an oval.

16
00:01:00,590 --> 00:01:01,720
That's perspective.

17
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:09,080
So let's go ahead and draw that peek of our come just like so and then we'll draw that rounded bottom

18
00:01:09,890 --> 00:01:10,840
like so.

19
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:16,370
So now we have a cone and that has some form to it because we can see that bottom edge.

20
00:01:16,490 --> 00:01:18,390
Next let's try a pyramid.

21
00:01:18,410 --> 00:01:21,630
So a pyramid is going to have a square or a rectangular base.

22
00:01:21,770 --> 00:01:24,460
So let's go ahead and sketch out that rectangular base.

23
00:01:24,500 --> 00:01:30,260
So let's say there are bases like so and then we need to draw our first surface.

24
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:35,240
So our first surface is going to be like this so from one corner to the other and then connect at the

25
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,080
top and then we can connect it at the bottom.

26
00:01:38,190 --> 00:01:42,100
Then the other one is going to go ahead and connect up to the top like so.

27
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:44,790
So now we have a very basic Pyrenean.

28
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,690
Now what if we wanted to create a random sort of organic shape.

29
00:01:48,830 --> 00:01:52,670
So let's say we wanted a shape like this.

30
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:57,120
So go ahead and quickly draw a shape.

31
00:01:57,830 --> 00:01:59,530
Now how can we add a form to that.

32
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:01,900
Well it's just like adding form to the cube.

33
00:02:02,060 --> 00:02:05,390
We just want to draw a line coming off of each one of these corners.

34
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,150
So and then we're going to connect all these lines.

35
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,840
But when we connect them on our line or sheep on this side has to match this edge right here.

36
00:02:18,860 --> 00:02:22,090
So first we'll do this one and then this is a solid object.

37
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,770
So you're not going to see this line continue because it's covered up by this area and but go ahead

38
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,580
draw a line there a line there a line there and a line there.

39
00:02:31,630 --> 00:02:34,340
And so now we just added a form to that shape.

40
00:02:34,340 --> 00:02:39,850
Now what if it was an organic shape so let's say we have a very random squiggly shape like so.

41
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:41,470
And we want to add some form to that.

42
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:46,370
Well all we have to do is have a line coming off there line coming off there and then we're not going

43
00:02:46,370 --> 00:02:50,030
have a line coming off over here because we're seeing the top of that over here we're actually seeing

44
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:51,910
the edge of that shape.

45
00:02:52,360 --> 00:02:57,340
I'm going to go ahead and add a line there and will add a little bit of a line in there.

46
00:02:57,380 --> 00:03:01,480
And then one right there and then whoops I went over a little bit right there.

47
00:03:01,550 --> 00:03:04,720
Then we can go ahead and we want to copy this shape like we did on this.

48
00:03:04,730 --> 00:03:10,250
We want to copy this edge over onto this edge so that sheep right there.

49
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:12,970
Copy this edge also.

50
00:03:13,550 --> 00:03:14,790
Perfect.

51
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:15,370
All right.

52
00:03:15,410 --> 00:03:22,900
So now you should have a pretty good idea of how to add form to your shapes but this is very basic form.

53
00:03:22,970 --> 00:03:27,290
What if we wanted to change things up a little bit like let's say we wanted to see these from a different

54
00:03:27,290 --> 00:03:28,200
angle.

55
00:03:28,250 --> 00:03:31,930
So with our cube Let's see if we wanted to see it for more of a top view.

56
00:03:32,090 --> 00:03:37,370
Well what we need to do is we need to stretch this top plane out a little bit more so that we see more

57
00:03:37,370 --> 00:03:41,240
of that top plane and a little bit less of this front plane.

58
00:03:41,240 --> 00:03:45,830
So what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and draw our front plane first but it's going to

59
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,290
be very very slightly squished.

60
00:03:48,290 --> 00:03:52,430
So a little bit less than a square and a little bit more of a rectangle.

61
00:03:52,430 --> 00:03:55,750
Now we're going to take this form right here and we're going to stretch that out by a lot.

62
00:03:55,790 --> 00:04:04,770
So we'll stretch it out like so and then we can go ahead and draw this edge for this plane like so.

63
00:04:04,780 --> 00:04:07,610
So now we're getting a lot more of a top view on that.

64
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:11,310
Q What do we want to see more of a top view on this cone.

65
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:14,220
Well what we need to do is we need to stretch this base out.

66
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:19,540
So right now imagine if we have a circle and we're looking at it from that view we want to see it more

67
00:04:19,580 --> 00:04:22,830
a top you just need to turn that circle down a little bit more.

68
00:04:22,960 --> 00:04:25,520
So this needs to become a more pull out.

69
00:04:25,660 --> 00:04:33,780
So let's go ahead and draw that sort of draw like so and then let's go ahead and draw an the triangle

70
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:35,370
part of our cone.

71
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:40,560
Go ahead and draw a bottom round edge.

72
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,940
And so now you get the illusion that you're getting more of a top down view of this cone.

73
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,540
Let's try this pyramid.

74
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:52,590
So let's say that we want to see a more top down view of this pyramid Well we go ahead and we draw that

75
00:04:52,590 --> 00:04:55,550
square base but with more of the top down views.

76
00:04:55,550 --> 00:04:59,500
So it's just like the circle if you can take a square with your hands.

77
00:04:59,550 --> 00:05:02,580
Let's say you're looking at it from a view like this.

78
00:05:02,910 --> 00:05:07,290
And then we're going to go ahead and we're just going to move that down so that we can see it for more

79
00:05:07,290 --> 00:05:08,290
of a top down view.

80
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:11,040
That's all we're doing with a square base.

81
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:14,010
So next what we want to do is we want to add in that first plane.

82
00:05:14,060 --> 00:05:20,210
MIKE So I'm having that second plane and then we'll have another bottom.

83
00:05:20,700 --> 00:05:23,740
So now we're getting much more of a top down view on that pyramid.

84
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,650
Now what if we wanted to turn something so let's say the shape right here at let's say we wanted to

85
00:05:28,650 --> 00:05:32,000
turn it a little bit more to the left.

86
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:33,480
Well we're the right.

87
00:05:33,620 --> 00:05:39,040
Well we have to do is we just have to squish the shape right here and then pull these out further.

88
00:05:39,060 --> 00:05:40,370
So let me show you what I mean.

89
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:42,890
So first let's redraw this base shape.

90
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:45,370
And we want to like I said squish it.

91
00:05:45,360 --> 00:05:50,370
So we're going to make this parade here skinnier and make this part skinnier

92
00:05:54,350 --> 00:05:55,310
like so.

93
00:05:55,640 --> 00:05:58,870
So now we have a lot more squished type of a shape like that.

94
00:05:59,040 --> 00:06:02,760
And then we're going to go ahead and take these lines and draw these out a little bit longer.

95
00:06:02,760 --> 00:06:09,360
So we're going to draw him out to about there and this one too about there is one too there and I didn't

96
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,930
copy the shape of her perfectly but it gets the idea crossed.

97
00:06:19,180 --> 00:06:19,890
Like so.

98
00:06:20,040 --> 00:06:23,070
So now I'm getting a lot more of a side view of this sheet.

99
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:26,620
What if we wanted to tilt the sheep forward like this shape.

100
00:06:26,830 --> 00:06:29,970
Well this will be a little bit more complicated but it can still be done.

101
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:34,690
So let's go ahead and draw the shape but you have to imagine the shape as though it's surface is being

102
00:06:34,690 --> 00:06:36,380
tilted forward like so.

103
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,430
And so it's going to become a lot more squashed in the diagonal angle.

104
00:06:40,480 --> 00:06:41,930
So let's go ahead and draw this.

105
00:06:41,950 --> 00:06:47,080
So first starting with this little loop right here I'm going to go ahead and drop that right there and

106
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:49,040
then I'll do this loop right here.

107
00:06:49,450 --> 00:06:55,650
And this one is actually going to just get squashed in this way rather than this way.

108
00:06:56,380 --> 00:06:57,730
And then we'll go ahead and do this one.

109
00:06:57,730 --> 00:07:00,300
This one will get squashed like so.

110
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,960
And then this one is going to stay wider like this one over here.

111
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:11,860
And then we can go ahead and draw our lines but we're going to make them go up more because it's been

112
00:07:11,860 --> 00:07:12,430
tilted forward.

113
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,390
So these lines are going to become more diagonal so they're going to almost be straight up

114
00:07:19,370 --> 00:07:21,900
and I'll go ahead and complete these edges.

115
00:07:25,980 --> 00:07:29,000
So connect those two lines also.

116
00:07:29,200 --> 00:07:32,940
So you get a lot more of a tilted view of this shape.

117
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,330
So I really hope you guys are starting to get a really good idea of how form works.

118
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:44,570
Now let's go ahead and draw a object from real life and try to capture its form.

119
00:07:44,570 --> 00:07:46,330
So I have my research here.

120
00:07:46,460 --> 00:07:53,030
And what I'm gonna do is I'm going to flip my paper over and I'm going to set my eraser right here in

121
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:55,000
front of me and I'm going to draw for you guys.

122
00:07:55,010 --> 00:07:55,510
OK.

123
00:07:55,700 --> 00:08:00,140
So first off I'm noticing that there's this bottom line so I'm going to go ahead and draw that bottom

124
00:08:00,140 --> 00:08:02,070
diagonal line like so.

125
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:04,970
And then the shape of the eraser is the first thing I want to do.

126
00:08:04,970 --> 00:08:11,380
So I want to draw the side view of it so it goes up like this and this side does the same thing.

127
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:17,480
And then it connects over like so and then connects like this

128
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:27,550
and this may actually not be the best view of the eraser so when I tried this one I'm going to turn

129
00:08:27,550 --> 00:08:33,700
my razor and try this you so I'm going to start off with my dad and a line and then I'm going to draw

130
00:08:34,570 --> 00:08:39,720
two other diagonal lines like so and create that basic shape of my razor.

131
00:08:39,730 --> 00:08:44,230
Then I'm going to go ahead and draw my lines going off in the opposite direction.

132
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:52,970
And I'll just connect all these lines and see that is the very basic shape of my razor if I want to

133
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:58,160
I can go ahead and round off all these corners some silver and a razor usually has pretty rounded corners

134
00:08:58,160 --> 00:08:59,450
because it's all used up

135
00:09:02,450 --> 00:09:06,850
and then I can even take my razor and go ahead and race away these unwanted areas.

136
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:13,920
Remember not to push too hard if you want to erase.

137
00:09:14,060 --> 00:09:19,240
This is why I always recommend that you start out drawing lighter and then move to darker colors.

138
00:09:20,490 --> 00:09:24,040
So there's the basic form from a real life object.

139
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,350
Now one last thing I want to go over with you guys before the end of this lecture is I want to go over

140
00:09:28,350 --> 00:09:35,430
with you form in a sphere so sphere is just a ball and basically a sphere is just going to be a circle

141
00:09:35,670 --> 00:09:37,230
without any highlights or shadows.

142
00:09:37,230 --> 00:09:40,540
You're not going to know the difference between a circle and an actual sphere.

143
00:09:40,710 --> 00:09:43,990
So let's say that we have a circle right here.

144
00:09:44,350 --> 00:09:47,540
Now there are no edges that you can add to this circle.

145
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:53,250
So there's no way to really show that this is an actual three dimensional form without having highlights

146
00:09:53,250 --> 00:09:54,520
or shadows to it.

147
00:09:54,570 --> 00:09:59,820
But in the next lecture we're going to go ahead and learn how to add highlights and shadows to our forms

148
00:10:00,030 --> 00:10:03,060
to make them look ten times more realistic.

149
00:10:03,060 --> 00:10:03,480
All right.

150
00:10:03,510 --> 00:10:05,570
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

151
00:10:05,730 --> 00:10:10,330
So in this lecture you learn how to turn shapes into three dimensional forms.

152
00:10:10,410 --> 00:10:15,070
So we learn how to make a cube which can also be translated into a rectangular cube.

153
00:10:15,090 --> 00:10:20,270
If you stretch these lines out in either direction we also learn how to create a cone.

154
00:10:20,340 --> 00:10:24,710
We learn how to create the pyramid of random shape and an organic shape.

155
00:10:24,850 --> 00:10:27,570
Then we learn how to redraw these at different angles.

156
00:10:27,570 --> 00:10:31,590
This is very important when you need when you're drawing out of your head is to understand how to draw

157
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:33,230
things in different angles.

158
00:10:33,250 --> 00:10:37,500
The more you draw from life the more you're going to understand perspective and how to draw from those

159
00:10:37,500 --> 00:10:40,020
different angles in the next lecture.

160
00:10:40,020 --> 00:10:44,010
We're going to go ahead and learn how to add in those highlights and shadows.

161
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:44,780
Thanks for watching.

162
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:47,960
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
