00:00:00.810 --> 00:00:06.900
It in today's lecture we're going to be going over a third type of linear perspective which is three

2
00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:08.250
point perspective.

3
00:00:08.250 --> 00:00:12.390
So we went over one point perspective already where there one vanishing point and we went over to point

4
00:00:12.390 --> 00:00:15.210
perspective where there are two vanishing points.

5
00:00:15.420 --> 00:00:20.700
And now we're going to go over three point perspective where there are three vanishing points now rather

6
00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:22.170
than being on the horizon line.

7
00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:27.980
We're only going to have two points on the horizon line and one point above or below our horizon line.

8
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:30.170
So let's go ahead and get started.

9
00:00:30.330 --> 00:00:33.710
So first let's make our vanishing points on the horizon line.

10
00:00:36.070 --> 00:00:39.790
Now these will act exactly the same way as they do with two point perspective.

11
00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:41.750
Go connect at some point together.

12
00:00:41.890 --> 00:00:46.550
But then there's a third point that gets introduced and we can either add that to the top or the bottom.

13
00:00:46.570 --> 00:00:49.840
In this case we're going to go ahead and added one to the top so we're going to add one right there

14
00:00:49.840 --> 00:00:55.630
into the middle of our page and then more what we're going to do is we want to decide where we want

15
00:00:55.690 --> 00:01:02.760
the middle of our ship to be or the corner edge so regularly we would make that a horizontal line.

16
00:01:02.770 --> 00:01:07.180
But in this case it's actually going to become a diagonal line because it's going to come off this third

17
00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:07.880
point.

18
00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:09.250
So let's go ahead and create that.

19
00:01:09.250 --> 00:01:14.830
So let's say that we want the corner edge of our cube to be right here.

20
00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:17.320
So we'll go ahead and draw that in like so.

21
00:01:17.710 --> 00:01:24.550
And now what we want to do is we want to go ahead and connect back to our vanishing points so will connect

22
00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.270
from here to there.

23
00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:33.640
Madrona and lightly so we can come back and you raise them to draw this one in from here to there and

24
00:01:33.650 --> 00:01:42.980
we'll go ahead and draw this one in.

25
00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:44.990
Then the last one.

26
00:01:45.020 --> 00:01:45.610
All right.

27
00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.030
Perfect.

28
00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:48.680
So now we have the corner edge of our object.

29
00:01:48.740 --> 00:01:53.100
The next thing we need to do is we need to create the other two edges of our box.

30
00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:57.230
Now in this case it's going to be exactly the same over the Collines rather than just going straight

31
00:01:57.230 --> 00:02:00.380
up and down are now going to lead back to this point.

32
00:02:00.740 --> 00:02:04.720
So let's go ahead and add those and so on to start off with the one on my left side.

33
00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:06.830
So I'm going to bring that to right.

34
00:02:06.930 --> 00:02:10.520
They're going to do the same thing over here.

35
00:02:10.580 --> 00:02:11.650
So we'll bring that to you.

36
00:02:11.650 --> 00:02:12.120
All right.

37
00:02:12.130 --> 00:02:15.240
They're great next.

38
00:02:15.260 --> 00:02:17.870
Let's go ahead and solidify those top and bottom lines.

39
00:02:17.900 --> 00:02:26.960
So connect them like so connect this one so you get the top one

40
00:02:30.110 --> 00:02:31.380
at get the bottom on.

41
00:02:34.230 --> 00:02:35.210
Right.

42
00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:36.520
Perfect.

43
00:02:36.930 --> 00:02:41.150
So why would you want to use three point perspective because this looks a little bit funky.

44
00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:46.860
Well this is if you want to make some really exaggerated perspective now generally you're not going

45
00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.900
to see through our perspective in real life.

46
00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:53.940
You do but it's to the very small degree where you almost can't even notice it and other lines appear

47
00:02:53.940 --> 00:02:56.100
to be vertically straight up and down.

48
00:02:56.340 --> 00:03:00.610
But if you really want to exaggerate that so you look like you're looking up as something really tall

49
00:03:00.610 --> 00:03:02.300
would say a skyscraper.

50
00:03:02.400 --> 00:03:06.900
What you're going to incorporate that third perspective or that third vanishing point in there to give

51
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:12.000
the illusion that it's going off into a distance just the way that these go off into a vanishing point.

52
00:03:12.120 --> 00:03:15.960
Well now the higher your object is the more it's going to go off into a vanishing point too.

53
00:03:16.170 --> 00:03:18.410
So let's go ahead and try another shape.

54
00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:23.180
So I want to go ahead and create my vertical line down here for my cue.

55
00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.400
So and then I'll go ahead and create

56
00:03:29.660 --> 00:03:34.570
this part down here for the top line and I will create the bottom part.

57
00:03:34.910 --> 00:03:44.120
So I can take that all the way back to the other vanishing point.

58
00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:45.820
Great.

59
00:03:45.820 --> 00:03:49.520
Now let's go ahead and treat the two other lines to make up our edges.

60
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.950
So put one right here.

61
00:03:54.060 --> 00:03:57.450
You know put another one right over here.

62
00:03:58.870 --> 00:04:01.490
Now we can go ahead and connect to those edges.

63
00:04:01.960 --> 00:04:06.310
So go ahead and connect from here to there.

64
00:04:09.250 --> 00:04:18.400
From here to there now we can go ahead and solidify those lines.

65
00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:41.580
We're perfect.

66
00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.720
Now what if you wanted to create a circular object in a three point perspective.

67
00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.670
Well the way you do that is the same way we do it with two point perspective.

68
00:04:49.700 --> 00:04:54.380
And the thing I really want you to realize about through some perspective is it's just like to point

69
00:04:54.380 --> 00:04:59.450
perspective the only difference is rather than only drawing the vertical straight up and down lines.

70
00:04:59.450 --> 00:05:02.930
Now those lines need to also lead to your third point.

71
00:05:03.320 --> 00:05:05.350
So how do we treat that circle.

72
00:05:05.390 --> 00:05:11.120
Well just like we do in two point perspective we go ahead and we draw an X through our box from one

73
00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:12.570
corner to the other corner.

74
00:05:12.590 --> 00:05:13.640
So we find our center.

75
00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:17.730
So there's our center right there and now rather than drawing a vertical line through this we need to

76
00:05:17.730 --> 00:05:23.000
lead that middle line back up to our vanishing point which is our third vanishing point.

77
00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.960
And then I find this middle line we need to go ahead and line it up at that point in the middle and

78
00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:30.360
then back toward finishing point.

79
00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.710
Now that we've done that we can go ahead and create our diamond

80
00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.270
in quickly sketch out our circles.

81
00:05:40.270 --> 00:05:42.450
So it's going to come around like some

82
00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:52.040
so now we have a basic circle in perspective.

83
00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:54.520
Now you can take more time to get that perfect circle.

84
00:05:54.530 --> 00:05:59.870
But I just wanted to quickly demonstrate how to find that circle in a three point perspective.

85
00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:02.410
Now why would you want to do three point perspective.

86
00:06:02.450 --> 00:06:06.420
Let's go over some examples where a three point perspective is used.

87
00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:12.110
Have you ever seen a drawing or a picture or a mat painting in a movie where there's a haunted house

88
00:06:12.170 --> 00:06:13.690
and you're looking up at the haunted house.

89
00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:18.590
And it's extremely exaggerated the haunted house looked really tall because the lines are getting smaller.

90
00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.070
The taller it gets.

91
00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:22.120
Well that's three point perspective.

92
00:06:22.130 --> 00:06:26.380
So let's say for example that this is the entrance to a haunted mansion.

93
00:06:26.540 --> 00:06:30.320
Well we would probably have a door right here.

94
00:06:32.090 --> 00:06:35.900
And then we might have a window up here.

95
00:06:36.190 --> 00:06:40.190
And I'm just trying to follow my perspective as best as possible I'm not going to take the time to actually

96
00:06:40.190 --> 00:06:45.580
draw it in.

97
00:06:45.920 --> 00:06:51.160
And then you might have a top on top of this.

98
00:06:51.310 --> 00:06:53.900
It's kind of a dumb sort of a shape.

99
00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:00.710
Then you might have slots of wood coming across here.

100
00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.950
And that's just a really quick example.

101
00:07:16.970 --> 00:07:21.800
Another place you might see this is in 3-D font.

102
00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:27.440
So let's say that for example you're creating a comic book and you want some really exaggerated stylized

103
00:07:27.500 --> 00:07:28.390
3-D font.

104
00:07:28.550 --> 00:07:34.610
Well what you can do is you can use this perspective to create that font and use this as your base.

105
00:07:34.610 --> 00:07:37.400
So let's say we wanted to put an M right here.

106
00:07:37.520 --> 00:07:40.750
So let me go ahead and draw a line for my top area.

107
00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.140
So we're going to put an end in this space right here.

108
00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:44.850
So let's go ahead and try all that.

109
00:07:44.870 --> 00:07:48.760
I mean as best we can in perspective.

110
00:07:56.670 --> 00:08:01.990
All right so once we have the M drawn in this plane now we can go ahead and add the other three edge

111
00:08:01.990 --> 00:08:07.480
to that by connecting back to this vanishing point all the way back to the edge of M and we'll go ahead

112
00:08:07.510 --> 00:08:12.190
and draw a line like so we don't have to draw it all the way we just want to draw to about the depth

113
00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.290
of what we want our shape to be.

114
00:08:14.330 --> 00:08:20.080
Then you go ahead and add that scene edgin like so will do the same thing underneath there and it will

115
00:08:20.080 --> 00:08:26.330
connect to this edge of R and also do the same over here.

116
00:08:26.440 --> 00:08:27.520
Same with this.

117
00:08:29.700 --> 00:08:33.570
Then if you wanted to you could go ahead and add in some shadowing underneath there to make it look

118
00:08:33.570 --> 00:08:35.340
more realistic and three dimensional

119
00:08:46.270 --> 00:08:50.100
but this is another example of where you might want to use three point perspective.

120
00:08:50.290 --> 00:08:54.910
And also like I said you might use this if you're doing a cityscape and you're looking up at skyscrapers

121
00:08:54.970 --> 00:08:57.850
you're definitely going to want to use three point perspective.

122
00:08:57.940 --> 00:08:58.360
All right.

123
00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.310
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

124
00:09:00.310 --> 00:09:06.180
So in this lecture we learn how to create a three point perspective and where we might want to use this.

125
00:09:06.190 --> 00:09:10.340
Now remember that three point perspective occurs everywhere in real life.

126
00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:17.380
It's just that your third point is so far off and so far away that you almost can't even see the slant

127
00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:18.880
in your vertical lines.

128
00:09:18.970 --> 00:09:22.620
And so they all appear like they're going straight up and down.

129
00:09:22.900 --> 00:09:25.960
But for the most part you're not going to really want to use point perspective.

130
00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:28.370
But if you ever do this is how you do it.

131
00:09:28.420 --> 00:09:32.590
Also remember that 3P perspective is just like two point perspective.

132
00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:37.210
The only difference is is that your vertical lines are going to lead back to your third point rather

133
00:09:37.210 --> 00:09:39.160
than going straight up and down.

134
00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.180
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
