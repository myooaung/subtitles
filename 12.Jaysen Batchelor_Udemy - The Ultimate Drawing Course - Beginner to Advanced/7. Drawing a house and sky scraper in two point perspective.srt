1
00:00:00,600 --> 00:00:06,360
All right in this lecture we're going to go ahead and draw a picture using two point perspective.

2
00:00:06,360 --> 00:00:08,710
So let's go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:12,960
So the first thing we want to do as always is create a horizon line.

4
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,630
Now I'm going to create my horizon in line more towards the top so we're looking down at our image or

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:19,230
object.

6
00:00:19,240 --> 00:00:24,900
So don't go ahead and lightly draw it in and then I'm going to put my two vanishing points one at this

7
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:26,960
end and one at this.

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,540
And then we can go ahead and get drawn.

9
00:00:29,550 --> 00:00:35,220
So in this image I think what I want to draw is a house and then maybe going to draw street next to

10
00:00:35,220 --> 00:00:36,300
it and a building.

11
00:00:36,330 --> 00:00:38,040
So let's go ahead and get started.

12
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:43,360
So the first thing I want to do is I want to draw my vertical line for the corner of my house.

13
00:00:44,740 --> 00:00:48,520
And then I'm going to go ahead and draw in my get a little bit taller actually

14
00:00:52,850 --> 00:00:56,180
and then I want to go ahead and draw a line from my vanishing point to that corner.

15
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,910
So let's go ahead and do that.

16
00:00:58,970 --> 00:01:04,250
Remember to draw very lightly until you know exactly where you want everything to be and then you can

17
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:11,530
go at it and draw those lines in Dogar.

18
00:01:11,690 --> 00:01:14,780
I will go ahead and do it from this vanishing point to this corner.

19
00:01:23,410 --> 00:01:23,830
All right.

20
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:24,360
Great.

21
00:01:24,410 --> 00:01:26,660
So now we have part of her house.

22
00:01:26,660 --> 00:01:31,680
Let's go ahead and create the edges of her house so create one line right here.

23
00:01:34,550 --> 00:01:44,360
So that'll create the other line over here like so next let's go ahead and create the roof for our house.

24
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:46,780
So this house is going to have a very simple roof.

25
00:01:46,790 --> 00:01:48,870
I'm just going to make a diagonal roof.

26
00:01:49,010 --> 00:01:52,700
So all I have to do is basically extend this line right here up

27
00:01:55,430 --> 00:01:56,080
like so.

28
00:01:56,120 --> 00:02:02,400
And then I can go ahead and draw a line from this point down to that one.

29
00:02:02,910 --> 00:02:07,700
And now that diagonal roof is incorrect perspective go ahead and do the same thing over here.

30
00:02:07,690 --> 00:02:12,580
So first I want to go ahead and draw this line from this point to that point

31
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:21,370
and then just eyeballing it trying to copy that same exact diagonal angle I want to go ahead and try

32
00:02:21,370 --> 00:02:23,270
to copy that over to this side.

33
00:02:23,540 --> 00:02:27,370
So I'll go ahead and draw that in like that.

34
00:02:27,370 --> 00:02:32,830
And then we can go ahead and add an overhang on this roof just by extending our lines a little bit further

35
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:37,650
and do the same thing on the other side.

36
00:02:42,030 --> 00:02:48,000
And then I'm going to go ahead and connect these two lines by drawing a line from my vanishing point

37
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,590
all the way down to this corner edge of my roof.

38
00:02:51,660 --> 00:02:53,110
Go ahead and connect that.

39
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:54,310
Perfect.

40
00:02:54,330 --> 00:02:58,890
So now we have the roof of our house next to it we want to do is you want to add some doors and windows

41
00:02:58,890 --> 00:02:59,900
to this house.

42
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:01,200
So let's go ahead and do that.

43
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:02,950
So first let's start with the door.

44
00:03:02,970 --> 00:03:06,760
So the door is just going to start off as a straight up vertical line.

45
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,450
So go out and draw that in next to it we want to do is want to go ahead and draw from this point.

46
00:03:12,450 --> 00:03:15,440
Back to our vanishing point.

47
00:03:15,510 --> 00:03:21,560
So now we're going to go ahead and draw a vertical line coming straight down from there.

48
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:26,860
So then we want to have this sort of indenting into her house.

49
00:03:26,880 --> 00:03:28,490
So we want to have a ledge on her.

50
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:31,820
So what we'll do is we'll connect this vanishing point to that corner right there.

51
00:03:31,830 --> 00:03:36,000
We'll go ahead and draw that in for However deep we want our door to go in.

52
00:03:36,030 --> 00:03:40,200
So we want to go about there and then I'll go ahead and draw a vertical line going straight up from

53
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:42,540
that point like so.

54
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:48,450
And then I want to go ahead and connect from this bottom corner to my vanishing point to create the

55
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:49,980
bottom edge for my door

56
00:03:54,030 --> 00:03:56,000
just like the scenario of a door.

57
00:03:56,010 --> 00:04:01,230
We can go ahead and add in the door knob on there if we wanted to know it's go ahead an ad in a window

58
00:04:01,230 --> 00:04:01,950
on this side.

59
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,550
So going to go ahead and draw a line from my vanishing point to here.

60
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,940
So that's going to be the bottom of my window right there and then I'll go ahead and draw a vertical

61
00:04:11,940 --> 00:04:13,900
line straight up.

62
00:04:15,100 --> 00:04:23,010
But the top point from my window and I'll go ahead and draw a line coming from this point back to my

63
00:04:23,010 --> 00:04:29,790
vanishing point and just eyeballing about where that is coming straight up from there is going to go

64
00:04:29,790 --> 00:04:31,410
ahead and draw that line.

65
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,290
So no we want to add some crisscrossing pieces to our window.

66
00:04:35,310 --> 00:04:42,330
So when they go out and add those and so out of one line coming across like so and then I can go ahead

67
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:44,550
and add in my vertical line.

68
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:46,540
So at about there.

69
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:47,820
Perfect.

70
00:04:47,820 --> 00:04:52,410
Now what if we wanted to add a window on this side but we wanted it to be at the same exact level as

71
00:04:52,410 --> 00:04:52,920
this one.

72
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:55,440
How do we know where that is on this plane.

73
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:01,530
Well the way we would do that is we'd go ahead and likely extend our line from the top of this window

74
00:05:01,530 --> 00:05:02,610
to this corner.

75
00:05:03,030 --> 00:05:04,710
And then we do the same thing with the bottom

76
00:05:10,730 --> 00:05:14,910
and then from each one of those two points we connect it back to that vanishing point.

77
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:28,290
So connect out like so much do the same thing for this one.

78
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:33,570
So now we have the top and bottom points so that we have a window lined up on the same level as this

79
00:05:33,570 --> 00:05:33,810
one.

80
00:05:33,810 --> 00:05:36,210
So let's go ahead and draw the window in on this side.

81
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:41,360
So go ahead and start off by drawing my vertical line like so I'll draw my second vertical line race

82
00:05:41,430 --> 00:05:45,840
here and then I'll go ahead and draw the middle one.

83
00:05:46,390 --> 00:05:50,530
Now we can go ahead and solidify those bottom and top lines.

84
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:00,910
So know we can go ahead and add in our middle one just by starting from our vanishing point in coming

85
00:06:00,910 --> 00:06:02,310
to about the middle.

86
00:06:02,410 --> 00:06:06,070
And if we wanted to we could do the same thing again to get this lined up correctly we can go ahead

87
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:11,860
and draw a line from this vanishing point to this line and then bring that to this corner.

88
00:06:12,310 --> 00:06:13,690
And then we'll do the same thing over here.

89
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:15,780
So we'll come from this vanishing point.

90
00:06:15,970 --> 00:06:18,590
Back to that corner where that line is up.

91
00:06:18,610 --> 00:06:21,810
Now we can go ahead and draw in our middle line on our window.

92
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:23,160
Like so.

93
00:06:23,290 --> 00:06:23,630
All right.

94
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:24,790
Perfect.

95
00:06:24,790 --> 00:06:27,040
Now let's add a chimney to this house also.

96
00:06:27,040 --> 00:06:30,180
So the way we'll add in our chimney and I know this is really incorrect.

97
00:06:30,190 --> 00:06:34,680
But just for demonstration purposes purposes we're going to add a chimney crack about this window.

98
00:06:34,900 --> 00:06:36,850
So let's go ahead and do that.

99
00:06:36,850 --> 00:06:42,610
So the first thing we want to do is we want to create a diagonal line a little bit further and from

100
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,120
this one.

101
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:48,150
So I'll add in a diagonal line about there and then we're going to add a line coming straight up off

102
00:06:48,150 --> 00:06:48,510
of that.

103
00:06:48,520 --> 00:06:53,890
So we want to have a vertical line coming off of that and that'll be the corner of the chimney.

104
00:06:54,220 --> 00:06:58,000
And then what we want to do is we want to connect back to this vanishing point and then come back to

105
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:05,230
here like so and we want to eyeball it so we're about right above this line and we'll connect those

106
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:07,460
with a vertical line.

107
00:07:08,680 --> 00:07:11,610
Let's go ahead and treat the other plane on this side.

108
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:18,070
So we have to do is connected that point back to a vanishing point.

109
00:07:18,340 --> 00:07:22,470
So we don't have to finish the line all the way back to the vanishing point we can just make it shorter

110
00:07:22,470 --> 00:07:24,240
because we know that we watch and read and write.

111
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:26,180
There are about there.

112
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:33,030
We'll go ahead and create a vertical line on this side and then we need to connect that point all the

113
00:07:33,030 --> 00:07:34,050
way back to there.

114
00:07:34,200 --> 00:07:38,550
So go ahead and connect that to that vanishing point.

115
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,500
So we can go ahead and Durgan in that line and then let's go ahead and create our top surface.

116
00:07:43,500 --> 00:07:48,480
So we already kind of have a line right here for that edge because we already have a roof line lined

117
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:49,390
up with it.

118
00:07:49,770 --> 00:07:53,280
And next what we want to do is we want to connect that vanishing point to this corner.

119
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:00,130
Like so and then we want to go ahead and create a hole in the top of our chimney.

120
00:08:00,130 --> 00:08:05,140
So the way we're going to do that is we're going to go ahead and create a smaller square within this

121
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:07,290
square.

122
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:09,020
So we're going to connect this.

123
00:08:09,090 --> 00:08:14,600
So we want it to be a little bit shorter so it doesn't touch the edge or that edge and we do the same

124
00:08:14,600 --> 00:08:16,410
thing down here.

125
00:08:17,450 --> 00:08:20,970
So connected right about here.

126
00:08:22,010 --> 00:08:23,270
Whoops that was really off.

127
00:08:23,300 --> 00:08:24,100
Sorry.

128
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:25,450
So let's try that again.

129
00:08:25,460 --> 00:08:31,190
Want to come a little bit further and from this line we want to go ahead and connect a little bit further

130
00:08:31,190 --> 00:08:36,600
and so we're connected to you about here should be good.

131
00:08:36,600 --> 00:08:38,100
All right that works better.

132
00:08:38,100 --> 00:08:42,600
Now we want to go ahead and connect from that vanishing point.

133
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:44,180
Back over here.

134
00:08:44,760 --> 00:08:48,030
Like so will do the same thing on the bottom

135
00:08:52,430 --> 00:08:56,170
you know I have sort of a smaller square on top of this larger square.

136
00:08:56,220 --> 00:09:00,340
What I want to do next is we want to go ahead and draw a vertical line comes straight down from there.

137
00:09:00,340 --> 00:09:04,000
And now that makes up here like it's a an actual hole.

138
00:09:04,410 --> 00:09:04,730
All right.

139
00:09:04,750 --> 00:09:09,510
So next let's go ahead and create a road or street for our house.

140
00:09:09,550 --> 00:09:14,920
So we need to finish creating these bottom line so we need to solidify those will solidify the site

141
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:16,280
also.

142
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:24,240
And then we want to have a road coming straight down here right in front of our house.

143
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:25,550
So let's go ahead and create that.

144
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,930
So it's just like one point perspective we just come from this point come all the way down

145
00:09:32,920 --> 00:09:36,360
like so and then we can do the same thing on this side

146
00:09:39,660 --> 00:09:40,890
just like so.

147
00:09:41,310 --> 00:09:46,430
And then if we want to add a ledge to this curve all we have to do is go ahead and draw a line coming

148
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:47,470
from our vanishing point.

149
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:49,560
But a little bit lower than our first line

150
00:09:52,470 --> 00:09:57,690
just like so perfect then let's go ahead and add a corner to our occurred.

151
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:00,090
So we're going to bring this line come in over here.

152
00:10:00,090 --> 00:10:00,900
Connecting it.

153
00:10:00,900 --> 00:10:02,780
And we might want to come out a little bit further.

154
00:10:02,790 --> 00:10:08,700
So maybe two out there we'll go ahead and connect those and we can just go ahead and draw that in by

155
00:10:08,700 --> 00:10:09,560
hand.

156
00:10:09,780 --> 00:10:16,920
Draw that went in by hand and then just go ahead and create the bottom line for her sake.

157
00:10:16,920 --> 00:10:21,330
So and then we just added vertical line right there to add the corner ever occurred.

158
00:10:21,330 --> 00:10:23,790
So now we have a sidewalk curb for our street.

159
00:10:24,270 --> 00:10:27,720
Next let's go ahead and let's create a skyscraper over here.

160
00:10:27,810 --> 00:10:33,830
So I'm going go ahead and draw a line coming off of my vanishing point over here.

161
00:10:33,830 --> 00:10:40,150
Like so and I think I want to corner my skyscraper to be right there.

162
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:43,710
So now I'm going to go ahead and draw a vertical line coming up off of that

163
00:10:46,530 --> 00:10:49,410
just like so all the way up into the sky.

164
00:10:49,410 --> 00:10:58,930
And then I'm going to go ahead and connect my top edge.

165
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:14,180
Remember to draw lightly that way you can always come back and erase.

166
00:11:14,310 --> 00:11:14,610
All right.

167
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:17,700
Now let's go ahead and connect these two vertical lines.

168
00:11:17,700 --> 00:11:19,790
So we want this edge right there.

169
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:26,970
We'll put this edge right over here on this side and then we can go ahead and solidify all these top

170
00:11:26,970 --> 00:11:27,830
and bottom line.

171
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:33,310
So my go ahead and put a line right there and I'll put a line right on the bottom edge.

172
00:11:33,390 --> 00:11:36,440
So do the same thing for the top

173
00:11:47,250 --> 00:11:48,440
just like that.

174
00:11:48,780 --> 00:11:51,920
Then let's go ahead and add some windows onto our skyscraper.

175
00:11:51,960 --> 00:11:55,920
So we're going to make this in a glass skyscraper.

176
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,210
So it's going to be very simple.

177
00:11:57,210 --> 00:12:00,620
We're just going to put basically a grid system on a skyscraper.

178
00:12:00,660 --> 00:12:04,760
So what we want to do is we want to go ahead and use a ruler and I'm using centimeters.

179
00:12:04,770 --> 00:12:08,740
But whatever you want to use go ahead and use that unit of measurement.

180
00:12:08,940 --> 00:12:12,420
What I'm going to go ahead and add a little mark every one centimeter

181
00:12:21,570 --> 00:12:25,350
and then what I want to do is I want to go ahead and connect a line coming from each vanishing point

182
00:12:25,350 --> 00:12:27,290
to each point on both sides.

183
00:12:27,540 --> 00:12:29,400
So I'll go ahead and do that now.

184
00:12:29,490 --> 00:12:35,050
So starting with this one I'm going to go ahead and speed this up because this might take a little while.

185
00:13:06,460 --> 00:13:07,360
Right great.

186
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:10,900
Now we want to go ahead and add in the vertical lines for Windows.

187
00:13:10,900 --> 00:13:17,770
So I'm going to skip every other on rectangle on here because we only want the windows on one little

188
00:13:17,770 --> 00:13:21,940
area and then the next part is going to be the floor and all the air conditioning and stuff.

189
00:13:22,020 --> 00:13:26,170
And so in real life you'd probably only have every other one of these being Windows so that's the way

190
00:13:26,170 --> 00:13:27,330
we're going to do it.

191
00:13:27,340 --> 00:13:32,020
So what we want to do is we want to create a vertical line coming down like so

192
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:39,440
them or to come over and we want it to be about the same space.

193
00:13:39,440 --> 00:13:43,610
So at this point you are going to be that noticeable but the further down we get it's going to get smaller.

194
00:13:43,610 --> 00:13:45,440
So I added another line like so

195
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:52,820
as we come over here we might have it become a little bit skinnier

196
00:13:58,370 --> 00:14:01,710
and come down a little bit further and it gets a little tiny bit skinnier

197
00:14:06,900 --> 00:14:09,360
and then we'll come down a little bit further.

198
00:14:15,770 --> 00:14:18,060
That'll come down a little bit further.

199
00:14:25,890 --> 00:14:28,090
And then let's go ahead and move onto this side.

200
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:53,350
Now I'm going to go ahead and speed this up so it goes a little bit quicker.

201
00:14:53,770 --> 00:14:54,040
All right.

202
00:14:54,050 --> 00:14:54,380
Great.

203
00:14:54,380 --> 00:14:56,570
So now we have the windows on our building.

204
00:14:56,750 --> 00:15:01,390
So now we've created a house and a building and a road into point perspective.

205
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,990
Now the last thing I want to do is I want to go ahead and break up my horizon line because like we said

206
00:15:05,990 --> 00:15:11,060
before horizon lines generally aren't going to be completely flat and straight unless you're out in

207
00:15:11,060 --> 00:15:12,780
the desert or on the salt flats.

208
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:17,740
So let's go ahead and add in a skyline of a city so City one I guess.

209
00:15:17,960 --> 00:15:25,160
So let's go ahead and we're just going to draw some random sort of rectangles just to represent some

210
00:15:25,160 --> 00:15:44,310
buildings out there we might even add a dome on one of them.

211
00:15:44,640 --> 00:15:45,180
All right great.

212
00:15:45,180 --> 00:15:47,200
So there is our city line.

213
00:15:47,220 --> 00:16:17,010
Let's go ahead and erase away any of these lines that we don't want to see that we're just our guidelines.

214
00:16:17,010 --> 00:16:17,400
All right.

215
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:17,960
Great.

216
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,380
So now we have our 2 point perspective drawing.

217
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:26,540
Now I wanted to do this demonstration drawn for you so you guys can understand how to point perspective

218
00:16:26,550 --> 00:16:30,800
is incorporated into drawings of real life objects.

219
00:16:30,810 --> 00:16:35,980
So your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and draw your own two point perspective drawing.

220
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:41,280
If you want you can copy this one or you can draw your own of whatever type of building you want whatever

221
00:16:41,280 --> 00:16:43,650
it is as long as it's square and cube.

222
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:48,150
Then once you do that I want you to go ahead and take a picture of it and post it to either the Q and

223
00:16:48,150 --> 00:16:51,240
A section of the Course or the Facebook group.

224
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:55,470
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one where we're

225
00:16:55,470 --> 00:16:57,750
going to draw a two point perspective drawing.

226
00:16:57,840 --> 00:17:01,680
But we're going to incorporate all of our highlights and shadows and all those things that we've learned

227
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:03,870
about up to this point in the course.
