1
00:00:00,700 --> 00:00:07,140
All right in this lecture we're going to go over advanced form in 3D Shadowline and highlights for those

2
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:08,360
advanced forms.

3
00:00:08,580 --> 00:00:14,480
So first off we're going to start off with the sheep that we created in a few years ago.

4
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:19,350
So it was sort of a squiggly plus sign.

5
00:00:19,350 --> 00:00:27,900
So and then we had the edges come off and just quickly finish up the shape so we can start demonstrating

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:29,210
on it.

7
00:00:29,900 --> 00:00:30,700
All right.

8
00:00:30,730 --> 00:00:34,470
So there's sort of our organic sheet that is foreign to it.

9
00:00:34,530 --> 00:00:37,310
But how do we add highlights and shadows to this.

10
00:00:37,430 --> 00:00:42,720
Well this is advanced because it's got some curves on it and it's also going to have some cast shadows

11
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:43,410
on it.

12
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,380
So first off we need to decide where our light source is coming from.

13
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,910
So let's say that our light source is coming from the top up here.

14
00:00:52,050 --> 00:00:56,000
So it's going to be shining down in this direction.

15
00:00:56,250 --> 00:00:58,400
So where are these highlights going to be.

16
00:00:58,470 --> 00:01:01,810
Well we're going to get a highlight on this top edge right here.

17
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:03,840
Really a highlight on this top edge.

18
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,580
And as this curves under it's going to get more of a shadow.

19
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:09,490
But then it curves back and you get more of a highlight.

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,100
So that's why it's considered complicated.

21
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:17,580
We're also going to get a cast shadow being cast from this object right here this part of the shape

22
00:01:17,970 --> 00:01:20,140
onto this bottom part down here.

23
00:01:20,160 --> 00:01:22,480
So let's go ahead and get started.

24
00:01:22,650 --> 00:01:27,990
So first let's start off with our core shadows are core shadows they're going to be on the opposite

25
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:29,480
side of our light source.

26
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:35,650
So that means it's going to be on these bottom edges of our sheep.

27
00:01:35,730 --> 00:01:38,220
So let's go ahead and fill those in.

28
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:45,540
Mike so smooth over here

29
00:01:49,890 --> 00:01:54,190
and then we also are going to get those core shadows over here.

30
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:55,410
All right.

31
00:01:55,410 --> 00:01:56,370
Perfect.

32
00:01:56,430 --> 00:01:59,420
Next we need to add in our other shadows.

33
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:05,700
So we've already kind of added in our mid-tone shadows here but we need to also add in a midterm shadow

34
00:02:05,850 --> 00:02:11,190
right here because as this piece curves back underneath you're going to get a little bit of a shadow

35
00:02:11,190 --> 00:02:15,700
there and then it's going to slowly fade back into highlight as you get to this surface here.

36
00:02:15,960 --> 00:02:19,460
So we're going to have a little bit of a shadow there.

37
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:20,700
Perfect.

38
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:21,380
All right.

39
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,980
Now next what we want to do is sense the light source is at the top and kind of hitting it more from

40
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:26,740
this side.

41
00:02:26,940 --> 00:02:30,860
We need to add a mid tone shadow to this surface right here.

42
00:02:31,110 --> 00:02:33,230
And so we'll go ahead and we'll add that in

43
00:02:42,610 --> 00:02:43,390
quit.

44
00:02:43,710 --> 00:02:48,840
Now lastly we need to add in a cast shadow from this object right here.

45
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,360
So this is going to be casting a shadow down onto this so let's add the edge of that shadow.

46
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:58,780
And then we can go ahead and fill in that area like so.

47
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,520
And now that has a nice cast a shadow on it.

48
00:03:01,520 --> 00:03:06,770
Now lastly let's add the cast shadow on tour surface and because this is a lot more complicated and

49
00:03:06,770 --> 00:03:08,410
it's kind of sitting on its edge.

50
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,030
It's going to be relatively complicated but it's ok we can go ahead and added it anyways.

51
00:03:13,220 --> 00:03:16,340
So this is going to be getting a cast shadow coming from this side.

52
00:03:16,340 --> 00:03:23,210
So it's going to be coming off like so then that's going to kind of come around like that and you're

53
00:03:23,210 --> 00:03:27,340
just going to basically get a mimic shape of your shape here.

54
00:03:35,300 --> 00:03:38,970
And as it comes off we don't even have to worry about the shape any more too much because it's going

55
00:03:38,970 --> 00:03:39,600
to fade away.

56
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:43,860
So let's go ahead and fill that in with our cast shadow value.

57
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:14,980
Just like so.

58
00:04:15,020 --> 00:04:15,320
All right.

59
00:04:15,410 --> 00:04:16,040
Great.

60
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:22,490
Now let's have a look at another type of and advanced highlights and shadows so let's say you that we

61
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:26,700
have sort of an organic shape something like this.

62
00:04:27,030 --> 00:04:29,070
Kate now that just looks like a flat shape.

63
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:33,830
But by adding highlights and shadows to it you can actually make it a three dimensional form.

64
00:04:33,920 --> 00:04:36,820
So let's decide where are light source is going to be coming from.

65
00:04:36,950 --> 00:04:42,410
Let's have it coming from over here and it's going to be coming in this direction from the switch over

66
00:04:42,410 --> 00:04:44,210
to a sharpened pencil.

67
00:04:44,210 --> 00:04:49,820
So first what we want to do is we want to go ahead and add in there the core shadow on the side that

68
00:04:49,820 --> 00:04:50,440
we needed on.

69
00:04:50,450 --> 00:04:54,350
So since the highlight is over here the shuttle is going to be on the opposite side of that.

70
00:04:54,350 --> 00:04:57,070
So we're going to get core shadow along this edge

71
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:11,020
as well as along this edge.

72
00:05:11,420 --> 00:05:18,130
Also get some rain here also get a little tiny bit right there and then we'll get a little bit right

73
00:05:18,220 --> 00:05:23,560
here also because all of this is on the opposite side of our light source.

74
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:25,290
Let's go ahead and add in our mid-tone.

75
00:05:25,290 --> 00:05:28,110
So on a lightly sketch sketching that mid-tone there

76
00:05:43,010 --> 00:05:45,480
and even these edges are going to get a little bit of mid-tone

77
00:05:53,510 --> 00:05:54,140
write cool.

78
00:05:54,140 --> 00:05:56,840
So now we just added some form to that sheet.

79
00:05:56,870 --> 00:05:59,330
So it stands out as a lot more realistic now.

80
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,750
We can also go at it and add in that cast shadows so the cash is going to be cast off like this.

81
00:06:30,130 --> 00:06:34,840
Now in this case the cash out it was so short that I didn't really have time to make it go from dirt

82
00:06:34,840 --> 00:06:37,550
to light so I kept the whole thing dark.

83
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:43,720
But now you can see we just added some three dimension to this flash shape just by adding some highlights

84
00:06:43,720 --> 00:06:44,750
and shadows to it.

85
00:06:44,980 --> 00:06:48,800
Now highlights and shadows get even more complicated than this.

86
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:51,130
So let's say that we were doing Iraq.

87
00:06:51,160 --> 00:06:55,290
So let's go ahead and draw sort of a random shape like so.

88
00:06:55,540 --> 00:06:57,780
And then let's decide where our light source is coming from.

89
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:03,780
So let's say our light source is coming from this side again and it's coming in that direction.

90
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,140
Well now it's a little bit more complicated because there's going to be all kinds of faces and different

91
00:07:08,170 --> 00:07:09,220
angles in here.

92
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:16,450
So first off what we want to do is we want to start off with the basic form of our rock so we know that

93
00:07:16,450 --> 00:07:18,130
the highlight is going to be hitting the top area.

94
00:07:18,130 --> 00:07:23,140
So we need to decide where this top area surface is so the top area surface is going to be something

95
00:07:23,140 --> 00:07:32,120
like so and then everything over here is going to be filled in with a mid-tone chateau where you can

96
00:07:32,120 --> 00:07:34,170
probably darken out a little bit more.

97
00:07:39,970 --> 00:07:41,400
All right great.

98
00:07:41,430 --> 00:07:46,020
So now that that's filled in with mid term shadow we need to decide where our surfaces are going to

99
00:07:46,020 --> 00:07:51,210
be that are on the opposite side of this as well we know for sure that this rock is going around as

100
00:07:51,210 --> 00:07:53,480
it gets underneath the bottom of the rock.

101
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:58,760
And so that's definitely on the opposite side of the light source so we can add in some darker shadow

102
00:07:58,760 --> 00:08:00,240
I mean on this bottom area

103
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,920
then let's not forget to blend that into our mid-tone.

104
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:24,290
All right.

105
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:25,020
Perfect.

106
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:28,310
But now what if we wanted to add kind of more texture in there.

107
00:08:28,320 --> 00:08:33,800
Will you do that by using highlights and shadows so let's say we wanted sort of a hole in a rock.

108
00:08:33,810 --> 00:08:39,780
Well what we can do is we can go ahead and add in some of our core shadow and then that would around

109
00:08:39,780 --> 00:08:46,140
underneath like so and now we got kind of the illusion that there's a hole in this rock today and we

110
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:52,020
can also go ahead and add and some other things such as a crack so we can put a crack along here and

111
00:08:52,020 --> 00:08:56,130
then as it gets into this highlight area it's going to get lighter and not be so dark.

112
00:08:58,760 --> 00:09:03,630
So and we can also do other things like use or CCRI undercuts.

113
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:09,210
So if I add in more of a dirt shadow like this and it fades in like that.

114
00:09:09,740 --> 00:09:15,290
Now I get a lot more of a look of an undercut my rock and I can add all sorts of stuff like this into

115
00:09:15,290 --> 00:09:19,410
my rock to start playing more with the form of the rock.

116
00:09:35,060 --> 00:09:40,520
And then up in this highlight area we can even add some more form by adding some of the mid tone color

117
00:09:40,820 --> 00:09:50,900
to create some of the same text from but basically any time you have shadows it's just creating form

118
00:09:51,340 --> 00:09:54,210
and shadows are just created from a lack of light.

119
00:10:04,140 --> 00:10:05,450
Cool.

120
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:12,850
Now let's try one more advanced type of form so let's say we want to do a format made out of a couple

121
00:10:12,850 --> 00:10:13,990
of different shapes.

122
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:17,720
So let's say our form is made out of a cube.

123
00:10:17,740 --> 00:10:19,840
So let's create a cube first first

124
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,910
and then let's say on top of that cube we have a cylinder.

125
00:10:26,930 --> 00:10:29,040
So going to go ahead and draw a cylinder

126
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:40,310
and then let's say on the cylinder or in this cylinder actually is a sphere that's partially stuck in

127
00:10:40,310 --> 00:10:43,340
the cylinder so we're going to draw a sphere right there.

128
00:10:43,340 --> 00:10:47,210
Now we're going to go ahead and finish drawing this item out.

129
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,140
Now as we get over here it gets a little bit tricky we need to figure out how that sphere connects into

130
00:11:05,140 --> 00:11:05,960
our cylinder.

131
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,140
So it's basically going to come around like this.

132
00:11:10,210 --> 00:11:16,460
That'll come down like so.

133
00:11:17,400 --> 00:11:22,220
So now it looks like that sphere is actually stuck inside of our cylinder and I can go ahead and erase

134
00:11:22,230 --> 00:11:24,520
away any unwanted areas like that.

135
00:11:24,900 --> 00:11:27,770
So how does the highly shatter look on this form.

136
00:11:27,810 --> 00:11:32,070
Well let's first off figure out where or like source is coming from so we're going to have coming from

137
00:11:32,070 --> 00:11:34,790
up here at this angle.

138
00:11:35,640 --> 00:11:39,330
So we know we're going to get a highlight right here on our ball so let's go ahead and add the pilot

139
00:11:39,340 --> 00:11:40,480
in first off.

140
00:11:40,500 --> 00:11:44,310
So we're going to go ahead and fill in this rounded area.

141
00:11:46,660 --> 00:11:48,290
We had of course Chateau

142
00:11:56,120 --> 00:12:03,130
the next thing we know is that this ball or sphere is going to be creating a cast shadow onto our cylinder.

143
00:12:03,140 --> 00:12:05,680
So we need to go ahead and create that cast shadow.

144
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:09,800
So it's going to be the cache that it was basically going to be the same shape as a ball.

145
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:10,930
It's just going to be stretched out.

146
00:12:10,940 --> 00:12:14,460
And also it has to be applied to this form right here.

147
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:20,190
So cast shadows are definitely applied to the form of an object that is being cast on.

148
00:12:20,300 --> 00:12:25,100
And so since this is a rounded object this is also going to get stretched and rounded around the edge

149
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,240
of this like so

150
00:12:29,460 --> 00:12:34,620
so then we can go ahead and fill in that cash shadow which is slowly going to fade out as it gets to

151
00:12:34,620 --> 00:12:36,040
the other side.

152
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:46,270
So and then we can go ahead and erase the way that wine a little bit because I got it too dark.

153
00:12:46,990 --> 00:12:50,800
All right then we can go ahead and add a little bit of Chateau up here at the top because that's also

154
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,070
going to be getting hit by the cast shadow.

155
00:12:53,390 --> 00:12:57,880
And let's go ahead and Durkan these lines up so we can see the form a little bit better.

156
00:12:57,940 --> 00:12:59,040
Perfect.

157
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,020
Next let's add the highlights and shadows to our cylinders.

158
00:13:02,020 --> 00:13:05,930
So even though we have this cash out of here we're still going to be more highlight and shadow on this.

159
00:13:05,950 --> 00:13:10,090
So down here we know that this side of the cylinder is going to be the highlight edge because the light

160
00:13:10,090 --> 00:13:13,660
is coming from this side and then this side is going to be our shadow.

161
00:13:13,670 --> 00:13:21,880
And so we can go ahead and add in our core shadow which is slowly going to turn into our mid-tone and

162
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:28,000
then into our highlife like so then we know that this cylinder is going to be casting a cast shadow

163
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,660
on the to this top surface of our cube.

164
00:13:30,700 --> 00:13:32,220
So let's go ahead and add that in.

165
00:13:32,230 --> 00:13:33,790
So the lights coming from this side.

166
00:13:33,940 --> 00:13:39,560
So we're going to go ahead and add in that cache shadow like so then we'll go ahead and fill that in.

167
00:13:39,580 --> 00:13:46,470
Switch over to more Shervin pencil.

168
00:13:46,730 --> 00:13:50,960
Perfect and it's not going to go over this edge because this edge is just going to turn into a shadow

169
00:13:50,960 --> 00:13:56,240
anyways so we'll leave it like so and then we know this top surface of the cube it's going to be the

170
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:58,080
highlight outside of our cube.

171
00:13:58,220 --> 00:14:02,540
And then we know this side is going to be our mid-tone so we can go ahead and fill that in with our

172
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:07,000
mid-tone color.

173
00:14:07,650 --> 00:14:11,580
Now that I'm looking at this I'm actually thinking that this needs have a little bit more of a tone

174
00:14:11,580 --> 00:14:12,760
around it.

175
00:14:17,050 --> 00:14:23,680
So let's go ahead and finish filling in and then decide it needs to be filled in with our core highlights

176
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,150
since it's on the opposite side of this lightsource.

177
00:14:26,170 --> 00:14:28,800
So let's go ahead and fill that in.

178
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:45,150
Right.

179
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:46,330
Perfect.

180
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:50,860
Now the last thing we need to do is we need to go ahead and add in a cast shadow from this whole entire

181
00:14:50,860 --> 00:14:52,410
object down here.

182
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,320
So first let's start off with the cube.

183
00:14:55,330 --> 00:14:57,640
So this light is coming off from that direction.

184
00:14:57,750 --> 00:15:03,910
So you need to go ahead and add in that cash shadow like so now we're going to get the cash out of the

185
00:15:03,910 --> 00:15:06,690
cube and then on top of that we're going to get the cylinder.

186
00:15:06,820 --> 00:15:11,920
And by the time he gets all the way to this this fear we're not going to see it any more because the

187
00:15:11,920 --> 00:15:13,210
cash out will fade off.

188
00:15:13,210 --> 00:15:43,840
So let's go ahead and add that now.

189
00:15:43,840 --> 00:15:44,170
All right.

190
00:15:44,170 --> 00:15:45,830
Perfect.

191
00:15:45,830 --> 00:15:51,440
So now we just went over four different advanced types of highlight and shadowing for form.

192
00:15:51,520 --> 00:15:55,850
They should be given you a pretty good idea of how to highlight and shadow advanced forms.

193
00:15:55,940 --> 00:16:00,130
Most things in life are actually going to be pretty advanced and they're not going to be as simple as

194
00:16:00,130 --> 00:16:05,920
a cube or a cylinder but they're going to have a lot more advanced things to it such as this piece right

195
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:06,670
here.

196
00:16:06,700 --> 00:16:11,290
Now your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and find some random objects in your house.

197
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:17,260
So say a shoe like we did before or anything else you can find that's more advanced and has a lot of

198
00:16:17,260 --> 00:16:19,740
different areas where there can be highlights and shadows.

199
00:16:20,230 --> 00:16:24,260
And then I want you to shine a light on that and then draw that from life.

200
00:16:24,370 --> 00:16:29,080
Once you've done that go ahead and take that image and post it to the Q and A section of the course

201
00:16:29,470 --> 00:16:31,980
or post it to the Facebook group.

202
00:16:32,020 --> 00:16:35,430
I really hope you enjoyed this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.

203
00:16:35,570 --> 00:16:40,360
Or we're going to look into how forum is used and created in the human face.
