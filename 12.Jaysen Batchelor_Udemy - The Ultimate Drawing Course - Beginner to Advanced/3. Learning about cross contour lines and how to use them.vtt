00:00:00.680 --> 00:00:06.480
All right in this lecture we're going to go ahead and go over something called cross country lines.

2
00:00:06.520 --> 00:00:08.920
Now what our cross contour lines.

3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:14.180
Well contour lines are the lines that make out the outside shape of or the outside line of your shape

4
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:21.130
and cross country lines or lines that can be used to create the inside values of your shape.

5
00:00:21.220 --> 00:00:25.850
Now let me show you the difference between just a normal country line and a cross country line.

6
00:00:25.990 --> 00:00:29.320
So here we have a sphere and we have a second sphere too.

7
00:00:29.380 --> 00:00:33.640
The first one we're just going to use contour lines straight lines and they're not going to be cross

8
00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:34.710
contour lines.

9
00:00:34.810 --> 00:00:40.690
So this means that let's say that we have our Shatto kind of more along this edge like so.

10
00:00:40.690 --> 00:00:43.240
So I want to go ahead and start adding in that shading

11
00:00:46.510 --> 00:00:51.760
and I'm doing it just by adding cross-current or contour lines so that lines can definitely be used

12
00:00:51.760 --> 00:00:55.940
to add value and shading and highlight to your artwork.

13
00:00:56.350 --> 00:00:58.650
But as you can see these are just completely straight.

14
00:00:58.750 --> 00:01:04.050
And then I can add a second layer if I want to that's a little bit darker.

15
00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:11.820
So and then I could add a darker edge along here and then that would kind of create my bounce light

16
00:01:11.850 --> 00:01:16.660
along this bottom edge and I can also kind of bring in a little bit more of the lighter edge there to

17
00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.900
soften that edge.

18
00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:21.820
And so those are straight contour lines.

19
00:01:21.820 --> 00:01:23.200
Now these work pretty well.

20
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.760
And depending on the style of artwork you're trying to create these might work like let's say you're

21
00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:33.160
trying to recreate a Victorian styled or a turn of the century solid piece of artwork.

22
00:01:33.310 --> 00:01:38.050
This could definitely work because printing presses would very often print in this style with straight

23
00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:40.120
lines that would make up an image.

24
00:01:40.270 --> 00:01:42.790
But in most cases you're probably not going to be doing it.

25
00:01:42.910 --> 00:01:45.280
So you want to go with cross contour lines.

26
00:01:45.460 --> 00:01:51.190
So what across contour lines or cross contour lines purchase lines that go along the surface of your

27
00:01:51.190 --> 00:01:52.510
actual object.

28
00:01:52.540 --> 00:01:57.100
So because this is a sphere we wouldn't have straight lines going across otherwise that would make that

29
00:01:57.160 --> 00:02:01.030
more of the flat surface or at least it would look more flat.

30
00:02:01.030 --> 00:02:05.950
So what we want to do is we want to add in our contouring lines but we want them to go along with the

31
00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.370
form.

32
00:02:06.370 --> 00:02:13.070
So for example we can start with our darker shadow that will make up most of the shadow of our sphere.

33
00:02:13.150 --> 00:02:18.070
So we're just going to add in those lines and they're going to have that same curve that curves along

34
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.990
with the sphere itself.

35
00:02:22.180 --> 00:02:27.800
And we can just go ahead and keep layering those in as you can see you probably getting the idea that

36
00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:34.280
hot cross country lines are just lines that follow the sheep of whatever it is that you're creating

37
00:02:34.490 --> 00:02:36.740
highlights and values on.

38
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:58.850
And then we can go ahead and add it in that darker area right here in the middle.

39
00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.830
So the idea is just to stay with that form of your shape.

40
00:03:06.040 --> 00:03:06.810
All right.

41
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:11.640
Now if you're still not understanding what Cross copper lines are let's have a look at a square or a

42
00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:12.470
cube.

43
00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.610
So if we were to do this with just straight contouring lines let's see how that would look.

44
00:03:17.610 --> 00:03:19.440
We're going to make this site our shadow side.

45
00:03:19.580 --> 00:03:24.250
And we're going to make this top part our highlight and this site will be our mid tone color.

46
00:03:24.270 --> 00:03:29.760
So first we're going to start off by adding that shadow in like so and as you can see I'm just using

47
00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:30.570
straight lines

48
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:40.950
that we're going to go ahead and add in some lighter lines on the side.

49
00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:52.530
And I want to add some a little tiny bit of shadow on the top part too even though it's a highlight.

50
00:03:52.530 --> 00:03:58.200
So what we'll do is we're going to read later this a second time with a little bit darker lines and

51
00:03:58.200 --> 00:04:02.380
then we're going to lightly add some lines along the top like so.

52
00:04:03.010 --> 00:04:08.830
So now this is creating the illusion that we have some form some highlighting some shadow but it would

53
00:04:08.830 --> 00:04:15.370
look a lot more realistic if our contouring lines were actually going along the shape of our image going

54
00:04:15.370 --> 00:04:16.750
along the surface.

55
00:04:16.780 --> 00:04:19.680
So I'm going to switch over to a shirt and pencil.

56
00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:21.070
So how would we do that.

57
00:04:21.220 --> 00:04:22.860
Well let's start off with the shadow.

58
00:04:22.930 --> 00:04:28.180
So rather than going straight like this we can create more of a surface illusion like going along with

59
00:04:28.180 --> 00:04:29.340
this wind or here.

60
00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:31.020
So that is incorrect perspective.

61
00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:39.730
So I'm just going to start adding those lines in like so.

62
00:04:41.950 --> 00:04:42.680
Great.

63
00:04:42.710 --> 00:04:47.390
Next we want to go ahead and add in the highly amik are the shadow in this area.

64
00:04:47.400 --> 00:04:49.790
Now this drawing this is actually correct.

65
00:04:49.790 --> 00:04:57.920
This is actually crossing contour lines so we can go ahead and just copy what we did there.

66
00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:06.470
You almost want to pretend like as if there is wooden slabs going across the surface is in what direction

67
00:05:06.470 --> 00:05:08.400
with those lines becomes.

68
00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:10.270
Now let's go ahead and add it to the top.

69
00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:12.830
So for the top we could either go straight across.

70
00:05:13.040 --> 00:05:15.190
But just to get the idea more crossed.

71
00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:18.980
We're going to go ahead and Adam in the state Agnel angle like so

72
00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:23.820
perfect.

73
00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:27.140
So these are examples of cross country lines.

74
00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:29.290
They make your artwork look a lot better.

75
00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:36.050
Now let's go ahead and look at some real examples of where we've used cross-country lines in our drawing.

76
00:05:36.110 --> 00:05:42.230
So put this aside and then I'm just going to grab our previous drawing we did and let's have a look

77
00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.960
at what we've done here.

78
00:05:44.150 --> 00:05:50.090
So a really good example of where this cross Caterine line is happening is right here along this edge

79
00:05:50.090 --> 00:05:51.020
of the brow.

80
00:05:51.050 --> 00:05:57.320
So we have a kind of almost curving and that's curving into the shape of our parabola which is underneath

81
00:05:57.320 --> 00:05:57.780
the skin.

82
00:05:57.780 --> 00:05:58.910
It's part of the skull.

83
00:05:58.910 --> 00:06:03.920
We're not going to get too much into that right now but it's going along the form in the shape smooth

84
00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:10.130
over here we have more of a curve going downwards and we also see that cross country line on the island

85
00:06:10.130 --> 00:06:15.820
where these lines the shadow lines are following the form and the shape of our island.

86
00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:19.020
Same with over here it's going in the same direction as our Eilidh.

87
00:06:19.220 --> 00:06:24.230
And we even see that with our eyebrows now even though our hairs are making it up it's still kind of

88
00:06:24.230 --> 00:06:25.070
the same idea.

89
00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:30.570
So the hair is flowing the shape and the form of our eyebrows.

90
00:06:30.660 --> 00:06:34.740
Now let's go ahead and add some cross country lines to our boot.

91
00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.070
So go ahead and set this drawing aside and then I'm going to grab my boot drawing that we did from before.

92
00:06:40.140 --> 00:06:45.840
So we just have a basic simple sheep drawing or line drawing what we want to do now is we want to add

93
00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.000
some highlights and values in there.

94
00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.260
Now don't worry if you don't understand how to add shadows and highlights and values I want you to do

95
00:06:52.260 --> 00:06:54.360
is look at your object or your boot.

96
00:06:54.360 --> 00:06:55.770
If you're drawing a boot too.

97
00:06:55.890 --> 00:07:00.540
And I want you to study where those dark shadows are and where those light are areas are.

98
00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:04.070
And I want you to try to recreate that by using cross contouring lines.

99
00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:11.040
So for example I'm going to have more of a dark shadow edge along this bottom area like so and when

100
00:07:11.040 --> 00:07:13.840
I add those in I want to follow the sheet of this boops.

101
00:07:13.860 --> 00:07:18.570
So rather than just doing straight lines like so I want to actually follow the shape of this boot when

102
00:07:18.570 --> 00:07:20.380
I add in the shadows

103
00:07:22.870 --> 00:07:26.350
then there's probably going to be a little bit more shadow along the edge so I'm going to go ahead and

104
00:07:26.600 --> 00:07:33.740
add it in like so and the top surface is going to be left pretty bright because it's going to be being

105
00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.840
hit by the light

106
00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:43.480
but you'll see my cross conjuring shadows are following the film.

107
00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:44.740
That's the important part.

108
00:07:44.970 --> 00:07:50.520
We would probably be getting shadow underneath this edge here just a little small one so I can go ahead

109
00:07:50.520 --> 00:07:55.830
and add in some cross contrat there and then inside here this is going to be very interesting part and

110
00:07:55.830 --> 00:07:58.680
this will really demonstrate how crosscountry worked.

111
00:07:58.950 --> 00:08:03.230
So in here we're going to have a lot more Shatto but we don't just want to do straight lines across

112
00:08:03.230 --> 00:08:06.480
it or fill it in with black because it's more on these edges.

113
00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:10.730
They're going to be a lot darker shadows and then this entire area is going to be a lot lighter.

114
00:08:10.770 --> 00:08:14.230
So we're going to add that in like so and we want to follow the form.

115
00:08:14.250 --> 00:08:20.020
So it's going to curve around like so we're here.

116
00:08:20.030 --> 00:08:26.700
We had a little bit darker and then we can lay in this middle area just see him adding that curve in

117
00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:31.260
there because what's happening in there is it's kind of making a tornado not a tornado but like a funnel

118
00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:33.630
that's going down or a cylinder.

119
00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.850
It's more of a cylinder shape.

120
00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:41.130
And so you want to really create that with your contouring lines.

121
00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.400
We can also add some contouring lines on the sole of her boot.

122
00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:56.020
So just like so we'll add some in here.

123
00:08:56.830 --> 00:09:01.540
Now this area right here is straighter than right there because this part of the boot is a flat straight

124
00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.040
surface.

125
00:09:02.050 --> 00:09:03.670
And so that's why it looks like that.

126
00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.590
So it's OK to use straight lines sometimes you just want to make sure that it's actually going along

127
00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:11.120
with the form of your boot.

128
00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:15.920
All right.

129
00:09:15.970 --> 00:09:18.280
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

130
00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:23.530
So in this lecture you learn all about cross country lines you learn that there are a lot better than

131
00:09:23.530 --> 00:09:28.470
just doing straight contrarian lines and then make your images look a lot more realistic.

132
00:09:28.750 --> 00:09:35.020
So just remember cross-country lines are lines that are used to create the form of your object.

133
00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:39.260
They go along the same shape is your object and that's what creates that form.

134
00:09:40.310 --> 00:09:45.980
Now with your assignment for this section of the Course is to go ahead and find an object or take the

135
00:09:45.980 --> 00:09:50.780
object that you've already been drawing and go ahead and draw your line drawing and then you're going

136
00:09:50.780 --> 00:09:55.490
to go ahead and you're going to add in your cross contouring to your image.

137
00:09:55.490 --> 00:09:58.670
And I want you to try to spend as much time on this as possible.

138
00:09:58.700 --> 00:10:03.050
Now if you really want to go the extra mile and really get your brain for your buck out of this course

139
00:10:03.140 --> 00:10:08.450
I really recommend that you do this with a lot of objects at least five different objects and 20 would

140
00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:09.350
be better.

141
00:10:09.380 --> 00:10:15.170
The more you study the better you're going to be I know it seems like everybody says that but it's cuz

142
00:10:15.170 --> 00:10:16.240
it's true.

143
00:10:16.250 --> 00:10:18.740
Practice makes perfect.

144
00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:22.070
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
