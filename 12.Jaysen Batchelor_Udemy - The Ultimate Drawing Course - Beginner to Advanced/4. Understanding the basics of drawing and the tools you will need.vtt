00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:14.260
In this lecture we're going to go over the basics of drawing as well as the basic tools you're going

2
00:00:14.260 --> 00:00:16.170
to need to complete this course.

3
00:00:16.180 --> 00:00:18.880
So right here on this page you'll see I have typed.

4
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.400
Fundamentals are not the only thing they're everything.

5
00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:24.050
So what does this mean.

6
00:00:24.250 --> 00:00:28.340
Well this means that it's all about the fundamentals.

7
00:00:28.420 --> 00:00:30.960
People want little tricks people want tools.

8
00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:34.130
They want these shortcuts to become a great artist.

9
00:00:34.150 --> 00:00:37.190
And the thing is there are no shortcuts.

10
00:00:37.210 --> 00:00:42.060
So even if you learn a really cool painting technique if you don't know how to draw.

11
00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:44.560
It's not going to look good at all.

12
00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:48.290
So you need to know how to draw because it's part of the fundamentals.

13
00:00:48.310 --> 00:00:52.210
The first part of drawing that you need to learn is lines.

14
00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:56.080
So right here you'll see I have a bunch of examples but different lines.

15
00:00:56.080 --> 00:00:57.670
So we have straight lines.

16
00:00:57.670 --> 00:01:02.420
We have curved lines we have as signs and we even have swirly lines.

17
00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:05.880
So there's all different types of lines and these are really important.

18
00:01:05.890 --> 00:01:10.180
Now of course lines make everything up lines make shapes up.

19
00:01:10.210 --> 00:01:11.770
They make everything.

20
00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:14.070
But there's even more to lines than that.

21
00:01:14.260 --> 00:01:18.380
So you'll see here in this example lines make up the perspective of this building.

22
00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:22.100
It's all about the direction of the line that creates the perspective.

23
00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:25.560
Here's another example of use of line.

24
00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:30.190
So right here you'll see these lines are trading the motion of this girl.

25
00:01:30.190 --> 00:01:33.580
Now let's say we were drawing this girl before we drew her.

26
00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:37.160
Probably what we would do is sketch out the lines of her motion.

27
00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:42.330
So you'll see here you have the center line which makes up her spine and her neck.

28
00:01:42.580 --> 00:01:45.130
And that's showing the motion of her entire body.

29
00:01:45.130 --> 00:01:50.170
So it's a nice curved line and we have a line here that's making up the shoulders and two lines that

30
00:01:50.170 --> 00:01:52.930
make up the swooshing curves of her arms.

31
00:01:53.020 --> 00:01:55.620
And we even have a line that her eyes follow.

32
00:01:55.690 --> 00:01:58.380
So lines are the fundamentals of drawing.

33
00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:01.270
This is the thing that you really want to get good at.

34
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:05.740
The next thing is shapes shapes are the next fundamental.

35
00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:07.590
Now there are four basic shapes.

36
00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.720
Square circle triangle and trap is a way.

37
00:02:10.750 --> 00:02:12.330
How do we use shapes and drawing.

38
00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:17.110
Well there's a lot of different ways we use them and we'll get way more into that later in the course.

39
00:02:17.110 --> 00:02:22.210
But for now you just need to understand that everything is created out of simple shapes so this girl's

40
00:02:22.210 --> 00:02:23.560
head is a simple shape.

41
00:02:23.710 --> 00:02:25.300
Her body is a simple shape.

42
00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:29.210
The next part of the fundamentals of drawing is the form.

43
00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:33.880
So what is form form is the three dimensional part of drawing.

44
00:02:34.030 --> 00:02:38.380
So right here you'll see I have three examples of of three dimensional shapes.

45
00:02:38.380 --> 00:02:42.880
We have a cube a sphere and a comb.

46
00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:47.900
Now there's all different types of ways that you can convey the different dimensions of a shape.

47
00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:53.260
So with the Cuban the cone it's obviously three dimensional because you can tell by the way the lines

48
00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.220
are shaped but with the sphere.

49
00:02:55.240 --> 00:03:01.110
If we just had a sphere drawn without any shadow or light it would just look like a circle.

50
00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:07.780
So the way we can convey the form of our sphere is by drawing these lines that are all over it that

51
00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:10.790
allow us to see where the form of our circle is.

52
00:03:10.870 --> 00:03:13.630
The next fundamental is value.

53
00:03:13.690 --> 00:03:17.620
So value is just how light or how dark something is.

54
00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:23.890
So right here you'll see we have an example of a photograph of a tomato and this tomato has many different

55
00:03:23.890 --> 00:03:24.500
values in it.

56
00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:28.650
In some areas it has of white such as the highlight around the top of it.

57
00:03:28.780 --> 00:03:35.200
And in some areas it's black such as the shadow of the tomato and then other areas have a mid-tone which

58
00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:36.580
would be a middle grade.

59
00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:42.560
Such as the main part of the tomato shadow and highlight will take your form to the next level.

60
00:03:42.640 --> 00:03:49.390
So you'll see here we have our original squares circle and cone but by adding shadow to it it makes

61
00:03:49.390 --> 00:03:53.290
it look much more three dimensional and adds a lot more form to it.

62
00:03:53.290 --> 00:03:55.800
The last fundamental is perspective.

63
00:03:55.810 --> 00:04:00.730
So once you understand all these things the thing that will really create a realistic look for all of

64
00:04:00.730 --> 00:04:06.340
your artwork even if you're only trying to create animations styled artwork it still needs to have correct

65
00:04:06.370 --> 00:04:07.760
perspective.

66
00:04:07.810 --> 00:04:14.530
Perspective is just the lines that make up shapes but it's in a three dimensional world.

67
00:04:14.530 --> 00:04:18.070
And so we'll get way more deep into perspective later in the course.

68
00:04:18.130 --> 00:04:24.490
But for now you just need to understand that perspective makes your images look correct and can also

69
00:04:24.490 --> 00:04:26.390
make them look grounded.

70
00:04:26.410 --> 00:04:27.010
All right.

71
00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.980
Now let's go over the basic tools.

72
00:04:28.990 --> 00:04:31.710
You're going to need to complete this course.

73
00:04:31.810 --> 00:04:36.900
So the first thing you're going to need to complete this course is you're going to need paper.

74
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:40.300
Now the type of paper doesn't really matter at all.

75
00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.660
The point of this course is it teach you how to draw.

76
00:04:42.670 --> 00:04:49.360
You should be able to draw on anything from copy paper to really nice Bristol board all the way to a

77
00:04:49.360 --> 00:04:50.290
napkin.

78
00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:56.580
So I really don't want you to focus too much on the materials that you're using but you do need paper.

79
00:04:56.770 --> 00:05:01.450
So I'm going to be using copy paper and sketchbook paper throughout this course.

80
00:05:01.450 --> 00:05:04.480
You can go ahead and buy a sketch book from the store if you want.

81
00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:09.350
And I actually recommend that you do this because you should really be doing one sketch a day and you

82
00:05:09.350 --> 00:05:12.020
should do it all in your sketchbook.

83
00:05:12.020 --> 00:05:15.250
The next thing you're going to need is you're going to need a pencil.

84
00:05:15.530 --> 00:05:18.520
Now you can also use any type of pencil you want.

85
00:05:18.650 --> 00:05:24.320
So if you just want to use a regular writing pencil that's fine if you want to use a drawing pencil

86
00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:25.990
that's completely fine too.

87
00:05:26.210 --> 00:05:30.080
I'm going to be using a drawing pencil and a Prisma colored pencil.

88
00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.200
Now a Prisma colored pencil is relatively expensive but it's not too bad.

89
00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.010
You can pick up a blue prism a colored pencil for about a dollar or two at the store.

90
00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:45.380
I like drawing with these because animators usually draw with blue colored pencil and so I just really

91
00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:50.850
like the look of drawings that are done with blue colored pencil the next thing you're going to need

92
00:05:50.850 --> 00:05:52.840
is you're going to need an eraser.

93
00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:58.620
You can either use the eraser on your pencil or you can use your own separte razor.

94
00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:01.230
Next you're going to need a ruler.

95
00:06:01.260 --> 00:06:02.280
This is a must.

96
00:06:02.310 --> 00:06:05.010
And you're going to have to have this for this course.

97
00:06:05.010 --> 00:06:08.820
We're going to use this to draw straight lines and use it for perspective.

98
00:06:08.970 --> 00:06:11.460
Really any ruler should do if you want.

99
00:06:11.460 --> 00:06:14.610
You can get an architect's ruler but it doesn't really matter.

100
00:06:14.610 --> 00:06:16.910
Just make sure that you have a ruler.

101
00:06:16.950 --> 00:06:19.550
The next thing you're going to need and this is recommended.

102
00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:23.490
You don't have to get this but like I said you can get a sketchbook.

103
00:06:23.490 --> 00:06:28.530
I have tons of different sketchbooks that are full of all different types of artwork because I'm always

104
00:06:28.530 --> 00:06:33.960
trying to experiment and figure out new styles new ways of doing things and the sketch book is a really

105
00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:39.690
good place to do these experiments so I really highly recommend that you get a sketchbook even if it's

106
00:06:39.690 --> 00:06:44.670
just a really inexpensive one and then draw on it every day.

107
00:06:44.670 --> 00:06:45.320
All right.

108
00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:47.750
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

109
00:06:47.970 --> 00:06:50.860
So in this lecture we went over the basics of drawing.

110
00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:58.120
So just remember that drawing is a fundamental and fundamentals are not the only thing they're everything.

111
00:06:58.470 --> 00:07:00.180
What are the fundamentals of drawing.

112
00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:05.280
Well first we have a line then we have shape then we have the form.

113
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:10.260
Then we have the value shadow and highlights and then we have perspective.

114
00:07:10.350 --> 00:07:15.410
And let's quickly do a review of all the tools you'll need for this course Sirk going to need paper.

115
00:07:15.510 --> 00:07:19.410
Pencil an eraser and a ruler.

116
00:07:19.410 --> 00:07:22.190
And it's recommended that you get a sketchbook.

117
00:07:22.210 --> 00:07:26.330
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
