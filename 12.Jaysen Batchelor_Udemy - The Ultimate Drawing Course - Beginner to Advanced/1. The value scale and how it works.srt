1
00:00:00,200 --> 00:00:03,890
All right in this lecture we're going to go over values.

2
00:00:04,020 --> 00:00:05,730
So what are values.

3
00:00:05,730 --> 00:00:09,370
Well values are just how light or dark the color is.

4
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,070
And it's based off of this spectrum right here or this value chart.

5
00:00:14,310 --> 00:00:20,040
So it goes from black all the way up to white and so and then everything in between is just a blend

6
00:00:20,040 --> 00:00:20,820
between those colors.

7
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:26,280
So this black right here and this white right here if you mix them together you get the center color

8
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:27,200
right here.

9
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:31,470
And then if you were to mix the center color with this black color you would get the center color right

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:33,390
there and it goes on and on.

11
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:40,500
Now this is broken up into 11 different values but really the value spectrum is infinite heir's there's

12
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:43,020
values in between each one of these values.

13
00:00:43,260 --> 00:00:48,610
And so basically you use these different values to create different lights and shadows and shading.

14
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:52,330
Now let's have a look at some examples of values.

15
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,280
So here I have a black white photograph of these shoes hanging from a telephone wire.

16
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:02,220
And what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and use my eyedropper tool which is a tool that

17
00:01:02,220 --> 00:01:07,140
allows me to select any color I want in my image and it will show me what the color is right over here

18
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:08,530
in this little box.

19
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:13,470
So I'm going to go ahead and use this to find each value in my picture and then I'm going to try to

20
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:16,390
match that value with my value appear as I do this.

21
00:01:16,410 --> 00:01:17,720
I want you to guess also.

22
00:01:17,730 --> 00:01:19,740
So let's start with this color right here.

23
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:21,080
It appears to be white.

24
00:01:21,120 --> 00:01:25,620
So let's go ahead and then switch over to her brush tool and try paint the on or white and it's just

25
00:01:25,620 --> 00:01:31,110
barely a little bit darker than white but pretty darn close so it probably would go somewhere in between

26
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:32,160
these two right there.

27
00:01:32,160 --> 00:01:37,830
Now let's try another color so I'm going to select this gray right here and then I want Guess which

28
00:01:37,830 --> 00:01:38,490
one it is.

29
00:01:38,490 --> 00:01:41,370
So I'm going to guess that this is a mid-tone gray.

30
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:43,380
And I was way off.

31
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,980
So it's very good to test this and practice with trying to figure out what values are what.

32
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:54,750
But another thing to understand is that depending on what value is next to another value that will change

33
00:01:54,930 --> 00:01:56,610
how dark or how light it looks.

34
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:02,430
So this doesn't look so dark because it's next to a darker gray So this green right here this one that

35
00:02:02,430 --> 00:02:07,810
looks like almost white is actually probably more of our mid-tone gray so I would put it right there.

36
00:02:07,890 --> 00:02:08,790
And I was correct.

37
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:10,690
So now it's re selected this color here.

38
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:13,500
And I would say this one is goes with that one.

39
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,890
Pretty darn close.

40
00:02:15,060 --> 00:02:18,110
Let's try another one so this darker gray down here.

41
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:22,280
I'm going to guess that it's not black but I would guess that it is.

42
00:02:22,370 --> 00:02:23,880
Square there and that's wrong.

43
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:25,900
It's this darker one.

44
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,920
And so it's kind of fun but it's also really useful to do this and test out how well you see value in

45
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:32,610
images.

46
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:36,600
It's also a really good way to see how values play off of each other because like I showed you over

47
00:02:36,600 --> 00:02:38,360
here this almost looks like a white.

48
00:02:38,370 --> 00:02:41,160
But it turns out that it's this light gray right there.

49
00:02:41,160 --> 00:02:43,060
Let's try one more value on here.

50
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,700
So I'm going to go ahead and I'm going to select this value right here and then I'm gonna go ahead and

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:48,530
try to find this.

52
00:02:48,600 --> 00:02:52,900
I'm going to guess that that's my middle gray and I was correct on that one.

53
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,580
Now I don't think there's actually any black in this image right here.

54
00:02:56,580 --> 00:02:58,790
Let's try another image.

55
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:01,280
So right here we have an image of a building.

56
00:03:01,470 --> 00:03:03,730
And I'm not even sure if there's any black on this.

57
00:03:03,750 --> 00:03:07,520
If there were any black it would probably be this down here in this window.

58
00:03:07,710 --> 00:03:10,070
Let's go ahead try painting with that.

59
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:11,480
And it is black.

60
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:12,240
All right.

61
00:03:12,270 --> 00:03:14,980
Let's try another color so let's try this right here.

62
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,840
So this may appear black but it might actually just be a dark gray and it's not.

63
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:20,870
It's somewhere in between.

64
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:23,850
So it's dark gray but it's not completely black.

65
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,360
Let's try another color so let's try this one right here and we'll try to paint you with that I think.

66
00:03:29,510 --> 00:03:32,080
Did it go right there pretty darn close.

67
00:03:32,100 --> 00:03:32,940
Try another one.

68
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:35,690
So we grab this gray right there.

69
00:03:36,060 --> 00:03:38,560
I'm going to guess that it's with this guy.

70
00:03:38,580 --> 00:03:40,350
Now let's try one more.

71
00:03:40,380 --> 00:03:46,110
So this over here appears to be a really like great but I'm going to guess that it's not as light as

72
00:03:46,110 --> 00:03:46,780
you think it is.

73
00:03:46,800 --> 00:03:50,960
I would probably put it somewhere around here and it is closer to this one.

74
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:52,620
So it's our middle grade.

75
00:03:52,950 --> 00:03:57,690
So it's really important to start studying values and things and I know it can be kind of hard when

76
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:02,310
you're looking at things in color but if you're able to find some black and white photos I want you

77
00:04:02,310 --> 00:04:07,150
to study those photos and try to figure out what values are being used in that photo.

78
00:04:07,230 --> 00:04:10,190
And if you can test it out in Photoshop that would be even better.

79
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:15,490
OK let's go ahead and hop back over to our paper and pencil and try some stuff out with values.

80
00:04:15,630 --> 00:04:16,290
All right.

81
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:21,720
Now what I want to do is I want to go over how to create values with your pencil.

82
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:25,970
So we had to look at them in Photoshop but now how do you create that with your pencil.

83
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:30,960
Well it all has to do with the pressure that you push on your pencil.

84
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:36,180
And so right now we're going to practice creating that pressure to create whatever value we want.

85
00:04:36,180 --> 00:04:44,100
So what I'm going to do first is I'm going to draw a rectangle like so and then when I want to do is

86
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:47,400
I want to create my own value spectrum within this rectangle.

87
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:50,910
But we're not going to break it down into separate sections like we saw in Photoshop.

88
00:04:51,060 --> 00:04:56,050
We just want to do one gradual gradient from our darkest color all the way up to white.

89
00:04:56,280 --> 00:04:57,990
So let's go ahead and do that.

90
00:04:57,990 --> 00:05:04,650
So basically we just want to start by pushing pretty hard down here and then we want to slowly get softer

91
00:05:04,710 --> 00:05:07,050
as we get up to this other side.

92
00:05:09,430 --> 00:05:14,590
And you really have to be paying attention to about where you are on your rectangle and you have to

93
00:05:14,590 --> 00:05:18,430
pay attention to how hard you're pushing because when you get back right about here in the middle you

94
00:05:18,430 --> 00:05:23,530
want to tap your mid-tone And as you get in over here you want the middle tone between this mid-tone

95
00:05:23,590 --> 00:05:26,280
and white and then it's the same on this side.

96
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:31,090
When you get to about the middle here you want it to be basically the mid-tone between this dark color

97
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:32,950
and the mid-tone.

98
00:05:32,950 --> 00:05:37,990
Now even this still isn't looking perfect so we can continue to keep shading it in until we get it looking

99
00:05:37,990 --> 00:05:41,680
correct because we want it to be as even as possible.

100
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:52,360
And even down here needs to be a lot darker something.

101
00:05:52,360 --> 00:05:54,170
Push harder now.

102
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:06,940
I think that looks much better.

103
00:06:06,940 --> 00:06:13,020
So now we have a nice gradual gradient from our darkest color all the way to our lightest color or value.

104
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,310
So I want you to practice this so that way you can get really good control of your pencil.

105
00:06:18,580 --> 00:06:23,590
And now what I want to do is I want to go over a drawing a sphere again but we're going to break down

106
00:06:23,950 --> 00:06:26,180
the different values within that sphere.

107
00:06:26,200 --> 00:06:34,670
So let's go ahead and start withdrawing our circle.

108
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:36,380
So those are circle.

109
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,410
Now let's have a light source coming from over here and then let's go ahead and start adding in our

110
00:06:41,410 --> 00:06:42,030
shadows.

111
00:06:42,040 --> 00:06:49,380
So I'm going to add in my shadows about here and then we want to make sure that we're using cross contouring

112
00:06:49,390 --> 00:07:04,980
So we're going along with the form of the shape.

113
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:05,420
All right.

114
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:05,980
Perfect.

115
00:07:05,980 --> 00:07:09,750
Now let's go ahead and add in our poor shadow on top of that.

116
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:12,610
So I could show there

117
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:30,910
the Maleev in that bounce light right there on the edge.

118
00:07:30,930 --> 00:07:35,310
And if you don't remember bounce light it's just the light that's being bounced off of the surface that

119
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:36,990
your ball is sitting on.

120
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:41,310
So now let's go ahead and add in a contouring line around this just so we can see your ball a little

121
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:42,260
bit better.

122
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:46,380
Yourselves a little bit off of that's all right.

123
00:07:49,210 --> 00:07:54,010
You know we can go ahead and add in our cast shows or cash it is going to be about there and then we'll

124
00:07:54,010 --> 00:07:55,390
go ahead and fill that in

125
00:07:58,470 --> 00:08:00,020
just like so.

126
00:08:00,020 --> 00:08:00,270
All right.

127
00:08:00,270 --> 00:08:00,960
Perfect.

128
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,850
Now let's have a look at this and figure out what type of values we have going on here.

129
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:12,270
So first off we have our highlight and in this case our highlight is our want and in other cases your

130
00:08:12,270 --> 00:08:16,920
highlight might be a little bit darker than light but your highlight is always going to be the brightest

131
00:08:16,950 --> 00:08:19,570
value on the spectrum.

132
00:08:19,590 --> 00:08:21,060
Next we have our Mathilde's.

133
00:08:21,070 --> 00:08:25,710
So this mid-tone right here is basically this mid-tone right here in the middle.

134
00:08:25,890 --> 00:08:32,280
But as it fades from the mid-tone to the white we get some of these other values in here that are between

135
00:08:32,370 --> 00:08:39,810
these two values then our next value is going to be our core shadow which generally is the darkest value

136
00:08:39,810 --> 00:08:41,570
or close to the Dervis value.

137
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,820
In every case your shadows are not going to be completely black.

138
00:08:44,820 --> 00:08:47,740
Sometimes they're a really light gray.

139
00:08:48,270 --> 00:08:55,350
And then once we get to that core shadow next is the bounce light the bounce light is sort of a mid-tone

140
00:08:55,490 --> 00:08:57,420
gray but it's a little bit darker.

141
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,780
And so we want to come a little bit more to the sides or mid-tone great somewhere in there.

142
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:08,030
And then next is our cast shadow and our cast shadow pretty well matches this foreshadow.

143
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:14,900
So it starts out as a dark black and then as we get to the end it fades into more of a mid-tone grain.

144
00:09:15,090 --> 00:09:20,910
So what I wanted to do is I want you to start viewing things not only as geometrical shapes and forms

145
00:09:20,970 --> 00:09:24,320
but now I want you to start viewing things in their values.

146
00:09:24,360 --> 00:09:28,830
So when you look at an object I want you to start thinking about what's the value of the object.

147
00:09:28,830 --> 00:09:35,430
For example this blue pencil even though it's blue it has a darker value than this white paper and you

148
00:09:35,430 --> 00:09:40,560
can tell because if you squint your eyes and look at this image the blue pencil in the white paper they

149
00:09:40,590 --> 00:09:45,950
definitely send out and there's a lot of contrast between them because of the difference in value.

150
00:09:46,290 --> 00:09:49,250
There's all other types of objects such as a pink eraser.

151
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:54,420
The black area in the pink eraser is a lot darker than the pink part.

152
00:09:54,420 --> 00:09:58,230
And so the pink has a lighter value than this black area.

153
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:03,690
So definitely start looking at things in that way and it'll really start changing the way you create

154
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:04,420
artwork.

155
00:10:04,530 --> 00:10:07,170
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

156
00:10:07,170 --> 00:10:13,320
So in this lecture you learn about contrast and the contrast spectrum and how it goes from black all

157
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:14,340
the way up to white.

158
00:10:14,550 --> 00:10:17,430
And there's every single value in between.

159
00:10:17,430 --> 00:10:22,140
So don't forget that value is one of the most important parts when it comes to drawing.

160
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,840
That gives you your highlights and shadows and it also gives you contrast with contrast artwork would

161
00:10:28,840 --> 00:10:30,100
not look very good.

162
00:10:30,270 --> 00:10:35,040
And in the next few lectures we're going to get more to contrast and how it works and why it makes things

163
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:36,170
look so good.
