00:00:00.790 --> 00:00:07.400
All right in this lecture we're going to go over how to use overlapping size and placement to create

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.150
space in your drawings.

3
00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:11.550
So let's go ahead and get started.

4
00:00:11.570 --> 00:00:14.560
So we're going to be drawing a picture of some eggs.

5
00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:19.970
So first off what I want to do is I want to draw my first egg which is going to be the egg that is nearest

6
00:00:20.030 --> 00:00:21.260
to me.

7
00:00:21.260 --> 00:00:27.580
So it's going to be right here in the center and it's going to be sitting upright.

8
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.210
Next we're going to do is I want to decide where my next egg is going to be.

9
00:00:32.210 --> 00:00:37.440
So the next egg is going to be placed behind this egg so that we create that space.

10
00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.540
We're also going to make the next egg just a little bit smaller than this one.

11
00:00:41.560 --> 00:00:46.240
So it looks a little bit further back the further away something is the smaller it gets.

12
00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:47.960
So let's go ahead and put another egg

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:52.260
up there.

14
00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:59.130
And then lastly let's put our last egg and we're going to put that off in the distance and it's going

15
00:00:59.130 --> 00:01:01.740
to be a little bit higher up towards the horizon line.

16
00:01:01.740 --> 00:01:10.620
That way it looks like it's also further away so it'll be smaller and higher up like so perfect.

17
00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:15.360
Next what we want to do is we want to start adding in our detail and highlights and shadows so we need

18
00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:17.880
to decide where our light source is coming from.

19
00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:21.540
So I think I'm an AM light source coming from up here down in this direction.

20
00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:24.310
So let's go ahead and start adding in our highlights and shadows.

21
00:01:24.300 --> 00:01:27.530
So first off I'll start with my basic highlight.

22
00:01:27.630 --> 00:01:31.380
I like shadow on the side and I'll do that on all of my matings

23
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:38.070
think so.

24
00:01:38.650 --> 00:01:58.490
And then I'm going to go ahead and start Durkan in my contour lines.

25
00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:05.300
So and then we go ahead and start really detailing these and so starting with this first egg.

26
00:02:05.300 --> 00:02:07.690
I'm going to go ahead and add in my core shadow.

27
00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.100
So of course that is going to come along like so

28
00:02:19.310 --> 00:02:22.350
you know I have my doubts lay along this edge.

29
00:02:36.250 --> 00:02:43.740
You don't want to go ahead and keep continuing to shake this thing with my midterm which I want to slowly

30
00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:45.000
fade into my highlight

31
00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:30.320
perfect them and to go ahead and add in our cast shadow.

32
00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:33.770
So this is going to ground or egg onto our surface floor.

33
00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:37.610
And it's also going to help create that space because we'll see where this cash is and then we'll see

34
00:03:37.610 --> 00:03:39.230
it Cash show for this too.

35
00:03:39.330 --> 00:03:44.820
And that will give us more space by seeing how much distance there is between those two cast shadows.

36
00:03:44.870 --> 00:03:47.070
So let's go ahead and have cash for this egg.

37
00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:48.900
So it's going to go about there.

38
00:03:49.090 --> 00:03:50.900
Then we can go ahead and fill that in

39
00:03:57.620 --> 00:03:59.050
perfect next.

40
00:03:59.060 --> 00:04:01.090
Let's go ahead and move on to this next egg.

41
00:04:01.130 --> 00:04:04.300
So I'm going to start off by adding in my core chateau

42
00:04:10.520 --> 00:04:17.720
then I can go ahead and start blending in the shadow with my mid-tone and then I can slowly blend that

43
00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:18.740
into my highlight

44
00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:10.960
and then we can go ahead and add in our cast shadows so go ahead and draw that line.

45
00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:13.680
So now I'll go ahead and fill that in

46
00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:24.790
and then let's move on to this last a back here.

47
00:05:25.020 --> 00:05:29.960
So since it's further away it's going to be just a tiny bit wider than the values in these NGs.

48
00:05:29.970 --> 00:05:31.940
So let's go ahead and start film those in

49
00:06:37.380 --> 00:06:40.810
and then we'll go ahead and add in the cast shadow for that egg.

50
00:06:40.890 --> 00:06:45.850
So it's come off like so.

51
00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:50.040
And then lastly what I want to do is I want to go ahead and add in there a horizon line

52
00:07:00.030 --> 00:07:03.100
and the horizon line might even just be the edge of a table.

53
00:07:03.580 --> 00:07:09.450
But the point of adding the horizon line is so that we can see where these eggs are placed distance

54
00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.670
wise in our space so we can tell that this is further away because of how close it is to that horizon

55
00:07:14.670 --> 00:07:18.070
line we can also tell how close it is because of how small it is.

56
00:07:18.210 --> 00:07:22.140
We can tell that this is further back than this one because of its placement.

57
00:07:22.140 --> 00:07:26.050
It's a little bit higher up than this egg and it's behind us.

58
00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:32.250
So we've used Sayce overlapping and placement.

59
00:07:32.250 --> 00:07:37.320
Now one last thing we can do to finish off this drawing is we can go ahead and add it in a darker background

60
00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:37.960
over here.

61
00:07:37.980 --> 00:08:49.710
So that way our eggs stand out a little bit more.

62
00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:52.550
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

63
00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:58.330
So this is what you do you learn how to use three different techniques to create space in your drawings.

64
00:08:58.330 --> 00:09:03.310
The first one was the overlapping technique by putting another object behind another.

65
00:09:03.490 --> 00:09:05.810
This creates space and distance.

66
00:09:05.830 --> 00:09:11.030
The next one was the use of size by making something smaller on the page.

67
00:09:11.050 --> 00:09:12.740
It makes it appear further away.

68
00:09:12.970 --> 00:09:14.980
And the last one was placement.

69
00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:20.800
So by placing something closer to this horizon line or its edge that makes your object seem further

70
00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:21.780
away.

71
00:09:21.820 --> 00:09:26.320
Your assignment for this lecture is to redraw this picture right here.

72
00:09:26.470 --> 00:09:27.810
Except you don't have to do Ags.

73
00:09:27.820 --> 00:09:32.280
You can do whatever you want you can do spheres you can do cubes you can do objects from life.

74
00:09:32.290 --> 00:09:33.260
It doesn't matter.

75
00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:38.150
I just want you to practice these three techniques of creating space in your drawings.

76
00:09:38.170 --> 00:09:42.790
Once you've done that go ahead and take a picture of your drawing and post it to either the Q and A

77
00:09:42.790 --> 00:09:45.770
section of the Course or the Facebook group.

78
00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:46.820
Thanks for watching.

79
00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.560
And I look forward to seeing you in the next election.
