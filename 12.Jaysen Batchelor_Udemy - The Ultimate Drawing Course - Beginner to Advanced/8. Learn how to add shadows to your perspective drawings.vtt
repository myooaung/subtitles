00:00:00.410 --> 00:00:06.270
Aren't in today's lecture we're going to be going over how to create highlights and shadows in your

2
00:00:06.360 --> 00:00:08.030
linear perspective drawings.

3
00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.350
So let's go ahead and get started.

4
00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:14.580
The first thing we want to do is we want to go ahead and add in our horizon line and then we're going

5
00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:19.760
to quickly draw a cube that we can use to apply highlights and shadows too.

6
00:00:20.040 --> 00:00:25.170
So once we get our horizon line we need to find our two vanishing points or you can even do this with

7
00:00:25.170 --> 00:00:31.050
one point perspective and then we want to go ahead and draw in that vertical line for the corner of

8
00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:31.740
our box.

9
00:00:31.770 --> 00:00:37.260
So I'm going to draw it in right about here and then I'm going to go ahead and connect those to my vanishing

10
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:37.940
points.

11
00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:05.860
All right.

12
00:01:05.860 --> 00:01:11.530
Perfect next to what we want to do is we want to go ahead and add in those horizontal lines for the

13
00:01:11.530 --> 00:01:12.780
other edges of our box.

14
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:17.590
So out and one right here then I'll have another one here on the other side.

15
00:01:18.040 --> 00:01:22.710
So and then we can go out and solidify these bottom and top lines.

16
00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:42.600
Great.

17
00:01:42.650 --> 00:01:44.260
So now we have a cube.

18
00:01:44.330 --> 00:01:48.880
The next thing we need to do is we need to decide where our light source is coming from.

19
00:01:48.890 --> 00:01:54.440
So I'm going to make my light source coming from up here on this topside so I'm going to come all the

20
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:59.080
way up to almost the top of my page and put a little dot there to represent my lightsource.

21
00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:04.490
The next thing I want to do is now that I know where my light sources I need to add in my core and mid-tone

22
00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:05.060
shadow.

23
00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.980
No we're not going to see our highlight because it's on the top surface and we can't see the surface

24
00:02:10.250 --> 00:02:11.790
because of the way the perspective is.

25
00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:14.380
But we are going to see our core and mid-tone shadow.

26
00:02:14.450 --> 00:02:19.010
So our core chateaus going to go on this side of our box because our light source is on the opposite

27
00:02:19.010 --> 00:02:21.140
side and then the side can be our mid-tone.

28
00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:23.070
So let's go ahead and fill those in.

29
00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:46.880
Great.

30
00:02:46.890 --> 00:02:50.860
So now we have our core chÃ¢teaux intermit shadow drawn in there.

31
00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:56.280
The next thing we want to do is we want to add any cast shadow now adding in casts shadows on linear

32
00:02:56.280 --> 00:02:58.460
perspective is very interesting.

33
00:02:58.470 --> 00:03:03.300
So what we need to do first is we need to go ahead and draw a vertical line coming straight down from

34
00:03:03.330 --> 00:03:04.160
our light source.

35
00:03:04.170 --> 00:03:08.990
So I want to go ahead and in my ruler up with that light source and come straight down.

36
00:03:09.390 --> 00:03:15.680
So all the way down to my horizon line and actually lines up right with the edge of my box.

37
00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:20.370
That means go ahead and put the little point right there on my horizon line.

38
00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:25.980
And then what we want to do next is we want to go ahead and draw a line from our light source all the

39
00:03:25.980 --> 00:03:28.170
way to each one of these top corners.

40
00:03:28.170 --> 00:03:30.030
So let's go ahead and do that.

41
00:03:30.030 --> 00:03:34.230
So our first one is just going to basically come straight down because it just so happens that a light

42
00:03:34.230 --> 00:03:37.530
source is lined up directly with this edge of our box.

43
00:03:37.530 --> 00:03:40.740
Now it's not always going to be like this but in this case it is.

44
00:03:40.810 --> 00:03:42.640
We'll try another example after this.

45
00:03:42.690 --> 00:03:49.190
Just so you can see a different scenario of creating the cast shadows and then your perspective.

46
00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.880
Will do this last corner.

47
00:03:55.090 --> 00:03:55.710
Great.

48
00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:01.420
Next what we want to do is we want to draw a line coming from at this point on our horizon line to the

49
00:04:01.420 --> 00:04:02.640
bottom three corners.

50
00:04:02.650 --> 00:04:07.210
So this one we already have the line drawn because it's going to be the same straight line then this

51
00:04:07.210 --> 00:04:08.410
one needs to come to that point.

52
00:04:08.410 --> 00:04:12.930
So we'll go ahead and draw that in and we can stop drawing our line.

53
00:04:13.180 --> 00:04:15.900
Once it gets to Right There were these two lines cross.

54
00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:20.560
So where this middle line crosses on the bottom and this middle line crosses on the top we can go ahead

55
00:04:20.590 --> 00:04:25.260
and end or line because that's the point we're looking for the must go ahead and do the last one.

56
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:31.090
So we'll line it up with this blast corner and we can go ahead and draw that in until it crosses with

57
00:04:31.150 --> 00:04:36.910
this line next to what we need to do is we need to go ahead and connect these points and we can actually

58
00:04:36.910 --> 00:04:37.870
see the crossing point here.

59
00:04:37.870 --> 00:04:40.890
So we're just going about a guesstimate where these would be crossing.

60
00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:45.280
So let's go ahead and take a ruler and we'll connect each one of these points so we'll connect from

61
00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:50.890
there to there and then we just need to guess to me about where these two are crossing.

62
00:04:51.010 --> 00:04:53.390
So these are crossing at about that distance.

63
00:04:53.530 --> 00:04:58.210
And since this one is a little bit further away the surface or this edge is going to be a little bit

64
00:04:58.210 --> 00:04:58.780
shorter.

65
00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:05.540
So we want to probably come to about there and then go ahead and draw a line from here to there.

66
00:05:07.610 --> 00:05:11.450
Just like so and so now we have the shape of our cast shadow.

67
00:05:11.450 --> 00:05:14.030
Now what we can do is we can go ahead and fill that in.

68
00:05:28.290 --> 00:05:28.720
All right.

69
00:05:28.750 --> 00:05:29.280
Great.

70
00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:33.530
So now we asked the cast a shadow for our box in perspective.

71
00:05:33.550 --> 00:05:38.230
Now let's try another one because since this light source was right above the edge of our box it kind

72
00:05:38.230 --> 00:05:41.840
of gave us a very strange scenario that you won't usually run into.

73
00:05:41.860 --> 00:05:46.450
So let's go ahead and try creating a box in a different position on our page.

74
00:05:46.510 --> 00:05:48.630
That way we get a different shadow on it.

75
00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:50.630
We don't get this weird thing happening here.

76
00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:56.410
So let's try it in a box right over here and I'm just going to follow the same perspective on the same

77
00:05:56.410 --> 00:06:00.610
line so just go ahead and draw a vertical line right there and then I'll draw a second vertical line

78
00:06:00.640 --> 00:06:07.300
right down here and then we can go ahead and connect these two corners back to our horizon line like

79
00:06:07.300 --> 00:06:08.210
so.

80
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:12.020
And I'm not going to extend all the way I'll just extend it part of the way.

81
00:06:14.950 --> 00:06:19.150
So that way I can just go ahead and connect another vertical line right there.

82
00:06:19.210 --> 00:06:19.570
All right.

83
00:06:19.570 --> 00:06:20.190
Great.

84
00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.830
Now let's go ahead and solidify all of these lines.

85
00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:25.580
So there are a lot darker and thicker

86
00:06:37.710 --> 00:06:39.200
but perfect.

87
00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:43.920
So now what we need to do is we need to decide where our highlights and shadows are going to be.

88
00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:49.280
So in this case we're not really going to see our highlight but we will see our core shadow and our

89
00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:50.120
mid-tone.

90
00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.650
So let's go ahead and fill those in

91
00:07:01.960 --> 00:07:02.940
are great.

92
00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:05.490
Now let's go ahead and add in our cast shadows.

93
00:07:05.490 --> 00:07:09.360
So again we're going to do the same thing we did on this box and we're just going to go ahead and draw

94
00:07:09.360 --> 00:07:13.880
a line from our light source to each top corner of our box.

95
00:07:13.890 --> 00:07:15.580
So let's go ahead and do that.

96
00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:18.250
So we'll draw from here to there.

97
00:07:20.550 --> 00:07:29.360
So draw from here to there number draw to our last corner.

98
00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:29.950
All right.

99
00:07:29.950 --> 00:07:31.430
Perfect next.

100
00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:36.340
Let's go ahead and do the same before our bottom corners so I'm going to go ahead and come to this point

101
00:07:36.340 --> 00:07:41.690
right here on my horizon line and I'm going to go ahead and draw to this first the bottom corner.

102
00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:49.090
And I can draw that until it crosses with this line right here which is my first line to that corner

103
00:07:49.990 --> 00:07:52.710
and then we'll go ahead and do the same thing for the next corner.

104
00:07:57.120 --> 00:08:01.980
And we can stop there because that's where it crosses and then go ahead and do the same thing for our

105
00:08:01.980 --> 00:08:07.120
last one so we'll go ahead and come to this last corner here.

106
00:08:07.430 --> 00:08:10.700
I'll draw that line across there until it crosses with this line.

107
00:08:10.750 --> 00:08:16.080
And now what we want to do is we want to go ahead and connect this point right there this point in at

108
00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.940
this point.

109
00:08:18.030 --> 00:08:19.500
So let's go ahead and connect those

110
00:08:23.610 --> 00:08:30.350
that will connect this last one.

111
00:08:30.410 --> 00:08:33.650
So and now we have the sheep for our cast show.

112
00:08:33.650 --> 00:08:36.970
Now let's go ahead and fill that in with our cast a shadow value.

113
00:08:59.110 --> 00:08:59.660
Great.

114
00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.200
So now we have that cast shadow in perspective.

115
00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:05.020
Now if you wanted to you can go add in a race away.

116
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:09.370
All of these guidelines which if you're doing a final product drawing that you definitely want to do

117
00:09:09.370 --> 00:09:09.570
that.

118
00:09:09.580 --> 00:09:14.560
But for now I'm just going to leave him there and your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and

119
00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.510
draw a cube in 2 point perspective than at a light source and then figure out where your course shadow

120
00:09:20.510 --> 00:09:23.140
is where your mid-tone shadows.

121
00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:27.820
And if you can see the highlight where your highlight is once you do that then I want you to go ahead

122
00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:32.260
and use your light source to create a cast shadow in perspective.

123
00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:37.630
And then I want you to go ahead and post that to either the Q and A section of the Course or the Facebook

124
00:09:37.630 --> 00:09:38.470
group.

125
00:09:38.570 --> 00:09:42.220
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one where we're

126
00:09:42.220 --> 00:09:45.610
going to learn how to draw round objects in perspective.
