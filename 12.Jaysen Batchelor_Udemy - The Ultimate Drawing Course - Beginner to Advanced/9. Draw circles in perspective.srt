1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,860
All right in today's lecture we're going to be learning how to draw round objects in perspective.

2
00:00:06,860 --> 00:00:12,110
Now this is very important if you want to draw more than just cubes in perspective.

3
00:00:12,110 --> 00:00:15,500
So first we're going to do is we're going to have a look at this square right here.

4
00:00:15,500 --> 00:00:22,670
Now this square represents the flat surface of one of the planes of let's say a box in 2D or in 2 point

5
00:00:22,670 --> 00:00:23,690
perspective.

6
00:00:23,990 --> 00:00:29,570
Well we need to figure out how to create around object within this that we can replicate even when the

7
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:32,010
square is warped into perspective.

8
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:35,450
So first of all we need to do is we need to draw an X through this.

9
00:00:35,450 --> 00:00:38,420
So we're not drawn X from one corner to the other.

10
00:00:38,420 --> 00:00:45,170
So one line like so and then we'll draw the other one like so.

11
00:00:47,410 --> 00:00:48,430
And so what does this do.

12
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:54,320
Well this tells us where the exact center of our square is or if this was a rectangle and tell us exactly

13
00:00:54,320 --> 00:01:00,220
where that center is so when you're in perspective let's say you're in perspective like so and that's

14
00:01:00,230 --> 00:01:00,940
your plane.

15
00:01:01,070 --> 00:01:02,390
Well you can still do the same thing.

16
00:01:02,390 --> 00:01:04,770
You can draw a line from there and a line from there.

17
00:01:05,180 --> 00:01:11,090
And now you know exactly where the middle of this plane is in perspective because this is going to be

18
00:01:11,090 --> 00:01:15,020
wider than this part yet that's still the center.

19
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:20,270
So once we know where our center is we need to go ahead and draw a plus sign through this.

20
00:01:20,270 --> 00:01:26,000
So basically we need to draw one vertical line through the center like so and then we need to draw one

21
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,680
horizontal line through the center

22
00:01:32,740 --> 00:01:38,400
like so and so now what we can do is we can draw a diamond within this square.

23
00:01:38,410 --> 00:01:47,160
So we're going to draw a line from this corner to that corner just like so and we want to do that all

24
00:01:47,160 --> 00:01:48,940
the way around our box

25
00:02:07,310 --> 00:02:09,690
or perfect So now we have a diamond.

26
00:02:09,810 --> 00:02:14,540
The next thing we want to do is we want to go ahead and draw a circle within this square.

27
00:02:14,790 --> 00:02:19,380
So the reason why we're doing this is because we're trying to see where that curvature is in comparison

28
00:02:19,380 --> 00:02:20,750
to this straight line.

29
00:02:20,790 --> 00:02:25,080
So a circle is going to basically come to about here.

30
00:02:26,790 --> 00:02:29,330
And then it's going to curve back down to this point like.

31
00:02:29,350 --> 00:02:35,220
So it will do the same thing right on over to this side and then we need to go ahead and do that all

32
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:36,390
the way around or circle

33
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,560
and this actually come out just a little bit more.

34
00:02:55,410 --> 00:02:57,040
All right so there's our circle.

35
00:02:57,250 --> 00:03:03,190
So basically by drawing this diagram we have a good understanding of how to recreate the circle on a

36
00:03:03,190 --> 00:03:04,940
plane that's in perspective.

37
00:03:05,110 --> 00:03:09,450
So what we want to do now is we want to apply this to a perspective drawing.

38
00:03:09,450 --> 00:03:15,650
So we're going to start off by drawing our horizon line them we're going to go ahead and add in our

39
00:03:15,650 --> 00:03:16,350
two points.

40
00:03:16,370 --> 00:03:20,520
So I had one vanishing point there and another vanishing point right here.

41
00:03:20,760 --> 00:03:22,820
Let's go ahead and draw

42
00:03:26,020 --> 00:03:30,940
our vertical line like so and then I'm going to go ahead and connect this so I'm going to connect one

43
00:03:32,320 --> 00:03:33,370
to that bottom point.

44
00:03:33,460 --> 00:03:35,050
And I'm actually not going to have this talk.

45
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,590
I'm going to go ahead and only bring it to about there like so.

46
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:43,180
So none of that line really matters.

47
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:54,810
Don't just go ahead and connect these two.

48
00:03:55,780 --> 00:04:00,270
And then I'm going to go ahead and erase this line since we actually don't need it that toll anymore.

49
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,090
And then we're not going to worry about making a top surface for this because you'll see why in a second

50
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:08,690
what we want to do is we want to create a circle on this plane perspective right here.

51
00:04:08,830 --> 00:04:14,460
So let's go ahead and add in our edge to our cube.

52
00:04:15,070 --> 00:04:18,490
And then what we're going to do is we're going to do the same pattern but on this face.

53
00:04:18,490 --> 00:04:21,290
So first off we need to go ahead and draw an extra.

54
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,880
So when I draw a line from one corner to the opposite corner.

55
00:04:25,030 --> 00:04:30,790
So now we'll do the same thing on the other corners.

56
00:04:30,930 --> 00:04:31,390
Great.

57
00:04:31,390 --> 00:04:36,940
So next we want to do is we want to go ahead and find where those vertical and horizontal lines are

58
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:37,810
that are in the center.

59
00:04:37,810 --> 00:04:41,830
So first we'll draw a vertical line right down the middle like so.

60
00:04:41,830 --> 00:04:47,530
So it crosses right through that middle point and then we want to find our middle line going horizontally.

61
00:04:47,530 --> 00:04:52,210
And so what we'll do is we'll line up our ruler with this midpoint right here.

62
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:59,010
All the way out to our vanishing point then we can draw a line right through that like so.

63
00:04:59,350 --> 00:05:02,530
So now we have our plus sign and or X next.

64
00:05:02,550 --> 00:05:04,440
We want to go ahead and create our diamond.

65
00:05:04,480 --> 00:05:06,330
So I'm just going to quickly do this by hand.

66
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:11,140
So I going to draw a line from there I'll draw another line from here to there and I'll draw another

67
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,310
line from here to there and I'll do this same thing with this last two points like so.

68
00:05:16,570 --> 00:05:21,970
So now we've created this same pattern but in perspective the last thing we want to do is we want to

69
00:05:21,970 --> 00:05:24,280
go ahead and draw and circle shape.

70
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:29,890
So we want to mimic this again so our circle comes to about the middle between this line and this corner.

71
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:31,940
So we want to do the same thing over here.

72
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:36,490
So we want to find out where that middle is and then we want to go ahead and draw a curve that comes

73
00:05:36,490 --> 00:05:41,300
and matches up to that point and then comes the matches back up to this point here.

74
00:05:44,550 --> 00:05:48,610
So then we'll do the same thing over here so we'll find the midpoint there.

75
00:05:48,630 --> 00:05:52,600
And so this one is actually since it's in this perspective it's going to be a lot more stretched out

76
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:53,480
than this one.

77
00:05:53,530 --> 00:05:55,660
So we'll go ahead and draw that one in

78
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:02,210
like so and then just go ahead and do the same thing for these bottom ones.

79
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:06,250
So we'll put a line right here in the middle we'll put another line right here in the middle also.

80
00:06:06,340 --> 00:06:09,960
So this you'll see gets really squished because of the way the perspective is

81
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,560
normal normally this last one.

82
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:24,260
All right great.

83
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:28,580
Now this isn't perfect but if you wanted to spend more time making sure you got those curves perfectly

84
00:06:28,580 --> 00:06:29,980
right it would look much better.

85
00:06:30,140 --> 00:06:31,820
But for now this will work well enough.

86
00:06:31,820 --> 00:06:35,550
So we have our basic circle shape in two point perspective.

87
00:06:35,570 --> 00:06:40,220
Now if we wanted to create a cylinder All we'd have to do is draw a line coming off of this corner right

88
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:40,670
here.

89
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:42,120
Back to our vanishing point.

90
00:06:42,140 --> 00:06:46,160
And the same thing for up here would draw from this top right here back toward vanishing point.

91
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:47,610
So let's go ahead and do that.

92
00:06:47,750 --> 00:06:52,370
But before we do that let's go ahead and erase away all of these guidelines because we don't actually

93
00:06:52,370 --> 00:06:53,620
need them any more.

94
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:00,670
All right.

95
00:07:00,680 --> 00:07:05,990
So now let's go ahead and draw those two vanishing point line so we'll go from right here and we basically

96
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:08,090
want to line up with this line right here.

97
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,130
So at that point all the way back to our vanishing line and then we'll go ahead and do the same thing

98
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:22,090
from here to that top point like so now as we get to this edge of our cylinder the perspective on the

99
00:07:22,090 --> 00:07:24,710
circle is going to change because it's in a different position.

100
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:28,190
So what you need to do is you need to basically do the same thing we just did here.

101
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:29,140
But down here.

102
00:07:29,220 --> 00:07:31,930
So you're first going to draw your lines coming from this vanishing point.

103
00:07:32,010 --> 00:07:37,770
But over to this area here you create a flat square surface and then you want to redraw your pattern

104
00:07:37,770 --> 00:07:43,200
onto it and then Krieger's circle and whatever edge you get on this side of your circle that's going

105
00:07:43,200 --> 00:07:45,100
to be the edge of the cylinder.

106
00:07:45,270 --> 00:07:49,210
But for now I'm going to go ahead and eyeball it in about where it should be.

107
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:53,570
But for you you want to make sure that you redraw this that when you get the correct perspective.

108
00:07:53,730 --> 00:07:57,260
So since it's further down it's going to be stretched out just a little bit more.

109
00:08:02,250 --> 00:08:06,620
Like so Nemo go ahead and solidified that top and bottom line

110
00:08:18,940 --> 00:08:19,320
right.

111
00:08:19,330 --> 00:08:19,790
Perfect.

112
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,020
So now we have a cylinder and two point perspective.

113
00:08:23,110 --> 00:08:25,620
Now where else might you want to draw a rounded edge.

114
00:08:25,630 --> 00:08:29,470
Well let's say that you're drawing on a building that has arches.

115
00:08:29,500 --> 00:08:35,560
And so you have your one point here and then you have your lines coming off like so and so here's your

116
00:08:35,560 --> 00:08:43,610
flat surface and then let's say that you have arches going like this on that surface.

117
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:48,760
Well to figure out how those arches are going to curve you do the same exact thing.

118
00:08:48,770 --> 00:08:54,840
You draw the same square right here and then you'd have to draw your X through it and then your plus

119
00:08:54,840 --> 00:09:01,380
sign through it and then your diamond and then you would need to draw your circle around in that.

120
00:09:01,690 --> 00:09:06,730
But there's all different types of places where you would need to use a round perspective in your drawing.

121
00:09:06,820 --> 00:09:10,100
Let's also say for example that you're drawing a current perspective.

122
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,890
Well if you need to draw wheels on that car you're going to need to know how to do that in perspective.

123
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:19,840
And so knowing how to draw roundings in perspective is extremely useful.

124
00:09:19,840 --> 00:09:21,880
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

125
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,350
So in this lecture you learn how to draw objects that are around in perspective.

126
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:31,570
So just remember that the way you draw around the object is first by finding the center of your object

127
00:09:31,990 --> 00:09:33,760
then by drawing it drawing a diamond.

128
00:09:33,790 --> 00:09:36,550
To use as a reference for your curve.

129
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:42,510
And then once you do that you want to apply that on to your surface area better in perspective.

130
00:09:42,670 --> 00:09:49,690
And then you want to replicate that curved line in proportion to your reference line which is the diamond

131
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:50,950
lines.

132
00:09:50,950 --> 00:09:54,750
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.

133
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:56,600
Now if you have any questions about this.

134
00:09:56,650 --> 00:09:58,720
I know that this can get kind of complicated.

135
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,110
Make sure you ask them in the Q and A section of the course.

136
00:10:02,110 --> 00:10:05,450
Thanks for watching and I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
