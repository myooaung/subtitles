1
00:00:00,740 --> 00:00:05,630
All right in this lecture we're going to learn how to do one point perspective.

2
00:00:05,630 --> 00:00:07,390
Now what is perspective.

3
00:00:07,460 --> 00:00:14,180
Well perspective is just creating the illusion of three dimensional space by using lines.

4
00:00:14,180 --> 00:00:21,560
Now the great thing about perspective is that it can very accurately portrayed this 3-D space by using

5
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:22,330
this technique.

6
00:00:22,370 --> 00:00:24,510
So let's go ahead and get started.

7
00:00:24,710 --> 00:00:27,880
So the first thing we want to do is we want to grab our ruler.

8
00:00:28,130 --> 00:00:32,270
Once we have our ruler we need to decide where we're going to put our horizon line.

9
00:00:32,390 --> 00:00:36,600
So our horizon line is just where the sky meets the earth.

10
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:37,480
It's that line.

11
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:42,110
So if you can go outside right now and look out there if you see the mountains or anything that's in

12
00:00:42,110 --> 00:00:43,120
the way it's not really going to work.

13
00:00:43,130 --> 00:00:48,380
But if you can see all the way off at the end of a street or something at that very point that is the

14
00:00:48,380 --> 00:00:49,990
horizon line.

15
00:00:50,070 --> 00:00:52,680
And so we need to figure out where that line is.

16
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:58,310
Now the higher our horizon line is the more it's going to look like we're looking down on the object

17
00:00:58,580 --> 00:01:01,770
the lower It is the more it's going to look like we're looking up at.

18
00:01:01,790 --> 00:01:06,230
So for example we're going to put it right about in the middle of our page and we're just going to go

19
00:01:06,230 --> 00:01:07,840
ahead and lightly draw that in.

20
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:11,920
We don't want it to dark because this isn't an actual permanent one.

21
00:01:12,020 --> 00:01:14,440
And then what we need to do is we need to make one point.

22
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:19,700
So since this is called one point perspective that's because we use one point to create this perspective.

23
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:22,840
And what this point is it's the vanishing point.

24
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:26,570
So everything goes back to this point and vanishes.

25
00:01:26,570 --> 00:01:31,430
So if you go out and stand on the middle of the street and you look all the way down to the end of the

26
00:01:31,430 --> 00:01:36,230
street you'll notice that it all comes down to one point and it's long enough you'll see that the street

27
00:01:36,260 --> 00:01:40,660
just eventually disappears and becomes so small that you can't even see it anymore.

28
00:01:40,850 --> 00:01:42,390
That's the vanishing point.

29
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:42,840
OK.

30
00:01:42,860 --> 00:01:48,610
And so from this vantage point we can draw any line we want out of it and use that as a guide to try

31
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:49,850
to draw shapes.

32
00:01:49,850 --> 00:01:51,380
So let's go ahead and try an example.

33
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:56,210
So if we take a ruler and put on our vanishing point then we can go out and draw a line coming off that

34
00:01:56,210 --> 00:01:56,940
vanishing point.

35
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,980
And we want to keep this line pretty light.

36
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,700
Got a little dark there but make sure you keep your lines light when you're drawing this because you're

37
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:07,130
going to want to come back and erase it.

38
00:02:07,730 --> 00:02:10,970
So now we have two lines that are going after vanishing point.

39
00:02:11,150 --> 00:02:16,120
The next thing we can do is we can go ahead and draw a vertical line like so.

40
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:19,790
And this one can be darker because we're actually going to leave that there.

41
00:02:20,030 --> 00:02:22,280
And then we can draw another one right next to it.

42
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,680
So put another one right here.

43
00:02:25,940 --> 00:02:26,880
Perfect.

44
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,000
And then what we want to do is we want to draw a horizontal line coming off of this corner right there

45
00:02:33,830 --> 00:02:40,430
and then we'll do the same thing over here and try to make about the same distance or length.

46
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:42,760
And I'm going to go ahead and connect those two.

47
00:02:42,850 --> 00:02:47,660
So connectome like so perfect.

48
00:02:47,660 --> 00:02:52,220
And then we can go ahead and draw on this edge right there and we can go ahead and draw on this edge

49
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:53,100
right there.

50
00:02:53,240 --> 00:02:56,220
So now we have a cube in perspective.

51
00:02:56,240 --> 00:03:01,190
Now if this is still really confusing you can go ahead and draw a line from this corner to that one

52
00:03:02,690 --> 00:03:09,020
and you can draw a line from this corner to our vanishing point.

53
00:03:09,020 --> 00:03:14,090
And then you can go ahead and create a horizontal line connecting this back area right there.

54
00:03:14,090 --> 00:03:16,840
And also this back area right here.

55
00:03:17,310 --> 00:03:18,870
So now you've kind of created.

56
00:03:18,980 --> 00:03:23,900
And we want to make sure we connect these arrays here perfect.

57
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,960
So now you've created sort of a transparent box.

58
00:03:27,980 --> 00:03:34,200
Now what you want to do now is you want to go ahead and race away the vanishing point lines.

59
00:03:35,330 --> 00:03:37,280
These don't really appear in real life.

60
00:03:37,300 --> 00:03:39,240
We're just using those as a guide.

61
00:03:51,830 --> 00:03:53,980
So now we have our clear cube.

62
00:03:54,260 --> 00:03:58,880
And then if you wanted it to be a solid cube that you couldn't see through you can go ahead and erase

63
00:03:58,880 --> 00:04:00,420
these lines back here.

64
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:02,480
On the other side of our queue.

65
00:04:09,460 --> 00:04:15,070
And then you're left with a solid 1 cube and we can go ahead and draw these lines in a little bit darker

66
00:04:23,820 --> 00:04:26,400
but this can be applied to any area of our page.

67
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:30,300
So let's say we wanted to make a square cube out here at the top.

68
00:04:30,480 --> 00:04:38,080
Well all we have to do is first off we're going to go ahead and draw our square like so and then we

69
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,580
have to do is draw a vanishing point line from each corner to our vanishing point.

70
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:48,790
So we'll go ahead drawing from there to there and we'll draw another one from this corner to our vanishing

71
00:04:48,790 --> 00:04:49,120
point.

72
00:04:49,150 --> 00:04:54,890
And then one more from this corner to our vanishing point.

73
00:04:55,390 --> 00:05:01,370
And then we just want to connect a vertical line like so and then from that seemed to me right here

74
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:05,100
on the corner of a connect a horizontal line.

75
00:05:05,630 --> 00:05:14,190
So and then we just want to draw these lines and Dharker and then we can go ahead and erase away these

76
00:05:14,190 --> 00:05:15,470
lines out here.

77
00:05:24,040 --> 00:05:28,590
Or I can see that now we have two different cues and they're in the same perspective.

78
00:05:28,590 --> 00:05:30,100
They're just in different positions.

79
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:34,010
And so this one is on the right side of our vanishing point.

80
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:38,410
And so we see more of this left side of our box.

81
00:05:38,440 --> 00:05:42,150
Now this cube is on the left side of our vanishing point.

82
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,310
And so we see the right side of this box.

83
00:05:45,370 --> 00:05:48,360
And so depending on where it is you'll see different faces.

84
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:53,560
So let's try one more because I want to show you how if you put one down here you can even see the top

85
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:54,460
of your box.

86
00:05:54,460 --> 00:06:03,970
So if I go ahead and draw a square just like so I can go ahead and create a cube by drawing my line

87
00:06:03,970 --> 00:06:06,470
from there to there and you can use a ruler.

88
00:06:06,490 --> 00:06:13,420
But I'm pretty confident in my line drawing abilities so I can go ahead and do it by hand and draw a

89
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:14,680
line from there to there.

90
00:06:14,710 --> 00:06:19,210
They're there with your head and you race away these vanishing point line

91
00:06:22,810 --> 00:06:25,680
and so you can see we can see the top surface of this cube.

92
00:06:25,810 --> 00:06:30,040
But since it's right in the middle underneath are vanishing point we can't even see either sides of

93
00:06:30,040 --> 00:06:33,250
it we only see the front plane and the top plane.

94
00:06:33,250 --> 00:06:35,400
Now I want to show you one more thing.

95
00:06:35,530 --> 00:06:39,910
You can create this perspective with any shape so you can create it with a triangle and can create it

96
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:41,140
with a circle.

97
00:06:41,140 --> 00:06:43,390
So all you have to do is draw your shape.

98
00:06:43,390 --> 00:06:49,720
So if we draw a circle or a here for example and we draw a triangle over here when all we have to do

99
00:06:49,720 --> 00:06:54,790
is we have to just go ahead and connect each corner of our sheep to our vanishing point.

100
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:57,460
So we'll go ahead and draw that in.

101
00:06:57,460 --> 00:06:58,860
So went from there there.

102
00:06:58,930 --> 00:07:01,550
And it went from there to there.

103
00:07:01,570 --> 00:07:03,870
Same with our circle.

104
00:07:04,640 --> 00:07:06,200
So on from there to there.

105
00:07:06,470 --> 00:07:12,360
And then another one from that edge all the way to her vanishing point.

106
00:07:13,130 --> 00:07:17,570
And then we just want to create the other side of our shape so this edge over here and all we're going

107
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:20,620
to do is we're going to copy this Edric here to over here.

108
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:22,250
So go ahead and draw that in.

109
00:07:22,310 --> 00:07:24,580
And then we can solidify these two lines.

110
00:07:24,740 --> 00:07:31,060
Same with our circles so wherever we want our circle edge to end we can go out and copy that edge over

111
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:37,490
like so and then we can go ahead and solidify these two lines and then I'm going to go ahead and erase

112
00:07:37,490 --> 00:07:40,060
away my vanishing point lines.

113
00:07:43,390 --> 00:07:43,830
All right.

114
00:07:43,860 --> 00:07:48,450
So this should give you a pretty good idea of how one point perspective works.

115
00:07:48,480 --> 00:07:53,610
In our next lecture we're going to go ahead and actually draw a picture with real life objects so you

116
00:07:53,610 --> 00:07:57,180
can understand better how one point perspective works.

117
00:07:57,180 --> 00:07:58,560
Thanks for watching today's lecture.

118
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:01,020
And I look forward to seeing you in tomorrow's.
