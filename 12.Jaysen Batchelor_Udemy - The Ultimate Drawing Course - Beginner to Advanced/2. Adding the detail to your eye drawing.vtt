00:00:00.490 --> 00:00:04.490
All right let's go ahead and add in all that detail to our eye.

2
00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:07.880
Now it's important to remember that you keep your pencils sharpen.

3
00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:12.150
There are a few cases where you might want to double pencil to do shading but for the most part you

4
00:00:12.150 --> 00:00:14.290
always want your pencil to be very sharp.

5
00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.130
So let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:19.700
So the first thing we're going to start off with is we're going to start off with the main part of the

7
00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:20.020
art.

8
00:00:20.100 --> 00:00:21.880
This is going to be the focal point of the eye.

9
00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:23.940
So we really want to focus on this.

10
00:00:24.060 --> 00:00:29.640
So I'm going to start off by first and darkening this area even further so now I'm pressing pressing

11
00:00:29.640 --> 00:00:35.400
pretty hard with my pencil and I'm just darkening that eyelash edge.

12
00:00:35.420 --> 00:00:37.230
Now I know we don't have any eyelashes in there right now.

13
00:00:37.260 --> 00:00:42.390
But for now we're just going to Durcan that edge then I'm going to come in here and start Durkan this

14
00:00:42.390 --> 00:00:49.630
top area and what I'm going to do is a mystery shaping my highlight or reflection whatever you want

15
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:50.290
to call it.

16
00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:55.330
But one of the highlights or reflection in the eye is is it's just a reflection of what's happening

17
00:00:55.390 --> 00:00:56.830
off in front of it.

18
00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:03.350
So over here this might be the skyline of a city in this highlight area is the actual Skop.

19
00:01:03.430 --> 00:01:07.630
So when you are thinking about reflections you've got to think about the things that are surrounding

20
00:01:07.630 --> 00:01:10.670
that object and that's what's going to be reflected in the eye.

21
00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:14.980
Whatever is white or really bright is going to be reflected on that.

22
00:01:15.560 --> 00:01:20.050
So and sometimes you don't have to necessarily show what that actual reflection is.

23
00:01:20.050 --> 00:01:26.310
You just have to take that into account and that will make your reflections look a lot more realistic.

24
00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:30.070
So I'm going to go ahead and continue to darken this area.

25
00:01:30.100 --> 00:01:33.250
The more contrast the better your artwork is going to look.

26
00:01:39.950 --> 00:01:42.960
And I can go ahead and start darkening in this area also.

27
00:01:43.830 --> 00:01:49.270
So you'll see we're creating a lot of contrast between this part of the eye and the why did I we were

28
00:01:49.270 --> 00:01:54.400
also creating a lot of contrast between the outer edge of our eye and the inner part of our eye and

29
00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:56.280
will probably darken this just a little bit.

30
00:01:56.500 --> 00:01:58.000
But we don't want to Durgan it too much.

31
00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.080
We want to keep that pretty bright so we keep that contrast.

32
00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:06.650
Now if you're doing a brown eye you actually would want to darken this area.

33
00:02:06.700 --> 00:02:09.520
In this case the eye is probably blue or green.

34
00:02:09.540 --> 00:02:11.260
So we're going to keep it pretty light

35
00:02:14.480 --> 00:02:17.030
and we can go ahead and start adding some more of that line.

36
00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:18.490
Ditto for the muscle

37
00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:27.420
and we can go ahead and Durkan our pupil

38
00:02:33.270 --> 00:02:36.270
and then what we want to do is I want to add an edge to my muscle.

39
00:02:36.270 --> 00:02:40.930
So since this is a muscle it's going to end its current around into this whole ring here.

40
00:02:41.010 --> 00:02:44.730
And so we're going to get a top edge just like we get on the bottom of our eyelid.

41
00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:47.240
We're going to get that on the edge of our muscle.

42
00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:53.940
So the way I'm going to show that is by darkening around this area but leaving a light edge around this

43
00:02:53.940 --> 00:03:01.560
part of the eye and you want to keep that white edge pretty thin but just enough that you can see what's

44
00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:02.580
going on there.

45
00:03:04.740 --> 00:03:05.160
So

46
00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.860
that makes it look a lot more realistic.

47
00:03:09.860 --> 00:03:13.130
Now let's go ahead and continue to darken this part of the eye.

48
00:03:20.910 --> 00:03:23.140
Want to make this reflection a little bit smaller

49
00:03:26.660 --> 00:03:32.270
and depending on how bright or how white something is that's being reflected in the eye that's going

50
00:03:32.270 --> 00:03:34.810
to determine how light the reflection is.

51
00:03:34.820 --> 00:03:40.640
So over here this area right here might be a little bit darker than this area because that might be

52
00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:45.960
buildings right there or that might be a car or something and this might be pure sky.

53
00:03:45.980 --> 00:03:47.980
And so that's going to be a lot brighter.

54
00:03:48.230 --> 00:03:54.760
So don't go ahead and Durcan that area just a little bit and keep this area completely white.

55
00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:20.170
And will continue to add in more contrast conduct these during these shadow lines that create or muscle.

56
00:04:20.410 --> 00:04:23.740
Now let's go ahead and move on to something else because like I said we don't want to get too focused

57
00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:25.210
on one area at one time.

58
00:04:25.210 --> 00:04:28.790
We want to be working on everything pretty close to the same time.

59
00:04:28.870 --> 00:04:32.020
And then we keep working and working and working it over and over again.

60
00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:38.080
So let's move on to something else so we're adding a little bit more shadow over here a little bit there.

61
00:04:44.430 --> 00:04:55.260
And we can add some more shadow on this edge.

62
00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:58.990
We can also start adding some more shadow on to the light of our high

63
00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.890
that's some more of us here also.

64
00:05:12.050 --> 00:05:19.840
Them darken and thicken the shadow on this edge just like so you want to soften that too so it's not

65
00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.140
such a hard line during this area and thicken it too.

66
00:05:28.760 --> 00:05:30.360
It can darken the shadow over here.

67
00:05:30.370 --> 00:05:31.020
Also

68
00:06:12.570 --> 00:06:15.870
Then let's go ahead and add some detail here to the eyebrowed.

69
00:06:15.930 --> 00:06:21.090
So the way you draw hair on an eyebrow is just with really quick strokes and you want to make sure that

70
00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:23.880
the hair lines are going in the correct direction.

71
00:06:24.030 --> 00:06:30.420
So starting off here we're going to have them going sort of up and then curving over so like that and

72
00:06:30.420 --> 00:06:31.860
you see how I'm pushing hard.

73
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:35.000
And then just quickly flicking it off.

74
00:06:35.450 --> 00:06:37.740
I'm going to switch over to sharpen pencil

75
00:06:44.700 --> 00:06:48.720
to just like so and then as we get over here the lines are going to become straight.

76
00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:52.490
So rather than starting straight up and then curve over we're just going to have them going straight

77
00:06:52.490 --> 00:06:56.170
over like so then we're going to do the same thing over here.

78
00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:58.610
But they're going to be going in a down direction.

79
00:06:59.350 --> 00:07:00.220
So just like self

80
00:07:14.230 --> 00:07:18.880
and then over here on this top area we're also going to have some that are coming at this angle.

81
00:07:18.890 --> 00:07:19.550
But up here.

82
00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:21.850
So we'll start like this.

83
00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:22.940
Come over

84
00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.220
perfect next.

85
00:07:36.260 --> 00:07:38.220
Let's go ahead and darken this eyelet area.

86
00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:41.380
So go ahead and add some darker shadow into there.

87
00:07:41.570 --> 00:07:47.450
Durkan this line Durkan that right there might even add a little bit more sheeting in there seam on

88
00:07:47.450 --> 00:07:48.760
this side.

89
00:07:52.190 --> 00:07:54.960
And then we might add some more shooting up here too.

90
00:08:15.890 --> 00:08:21.740
And then I'm going to circle this bottom hedge and now the next thing we want to do is we want to add

91
00:08:21.740 --> 00:08:25.110
some eyelashes in there because right now the ice is pretty bare.

92
00:08:25.130 --> 00:08:27.370
So let's go ahead and add those in now.

93
00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.210
Eyelashes are a very interesting thing to add because a lot of people do them incorrectly.

94
00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:36.160
So I'm going to teach you how to correctly add in your eyelashes on and on.

95
00:08:36.320 --> 00:08:38.590
So we're going to start with the top eyelashes.

96
00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.230
Now the thing to understand about eyelashes is that they're in perspective.

97
00:08:42.230 --> 00:08:46.670
So they're not just lines that come up like so well over here in this area they're going to come off

98
00:08:46.670 --> 00:08:47.320
like so.

99
00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:52.490
But when you look at them on this middle area they're actually going to do sort of curving so they're

100
00:08:52.490 --> 00:08:57.590
first going to come down off the island and then they're going to come back up like so.

101
00:08:57.920 --> 00:09:00.410
So they'll come down and curve and then come back up.

102
00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.050
Smith over here they'll come down and curve and then come back up.

103
00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:08.150
And the further towards the edge they get the more you're going to see that rather than looking straight

104
00:09:08.150 --> 00:09:08.810
on on them.

105
00:09:08.810 --> 00:09:12.740
So like right about here it's actually almost just going to be a line that comes straight down and then

106
00:09:12.740 --> 00:09:17.760
back up over here you're going to see the curve but it's going to be going in the opposite direction.

107
00:09:17.790 --> 00:09:23.630
So it's going to curve down and then come back up the curve down and then come back up.

108
00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:25.780
You want to try to get those as curved as possible.

109
00:09:25.780 --> 00:09:28.940
It was kind of a bad curve right there but it'll work for now.

110
00:09:29.110 --> 00:09:33.430
So we're going to continue to do this and we want to double these up so in each eyelash we want to go

111
00:09:33.430 --> 00:09:36.220
ahead and add two eyelashes to each one.

112
00:09:36.210 --> 00:09:39.670
And we want them to sort of cross so it might come like this.

113
00:09:39.820 --> 00:09:44.730
And then another one might come right there and another one might come right about there.

114
00:09:44.780 --> 00:09:50.420
Then another one there and this guy will get a second one and that one will get a second one.

115
00:09:50.440 --> 00:09:53.250
This one will get a second one and that one will get them.

116
00:09:53.520 --> 00:09:56.440
So now we're how the base for our eyelashes.

117
00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:58.560
Let's go ahead and move onto the ones down here.

118
00:09:58.680 --> 00:10:01.180
And you'll also notice that I'm pushing really hard.

119
00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:05.140
And then just like the hair on our eyebrow we're going to just look it off.

120
00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.250
So we'll push hard and then we're going to pull it off.

121
00:10:09.250 --> 00:10:09.980
Push hard.

122
00:10:10.030 --> 00:10:15.210
We're going to foot it off push or pull it off just like so.

123
00:10:15.250 --> 00:10:20.470
And the reason why we're doing that is because it allows us to quickly get that nice curved line.

124
00:10:20.470 --> 00:10:24.970
So as we get up here we're going to go straight on view of it and then over here see a little bit more

125
00:10:24.970 --> 00:10:29.240
of that curve but going in the other direction now we want to double these up

126
00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:40.260
great now we can go ahead and start adding more eyelashes.

127
00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:41.820
Not that we have the base.

128
00:10:41.820 --> 00:10:46.140
Now the reason why you want to add these bases and spread them out because this is going to give you

129
00:10:46.140 --> 00:10:48.570
the general direction of where eyelashes should be.

130
00:10:48.690 --> 00:10:51.480
So if you're adding them and you don't really have to think about it over here.

131
00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:56.660
I know it needs to kind of match between these two so he's be like so and over here I know when he's

132
00:10:56.670 --> 00:10:58.860
come down like so and come up like that.

133
00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:01.440
So I don't really have to think about it too much.

134
00:11:01.470 --> 00:11:03.790
Where the direction is and what the perspective is.

135
00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:06.600
So I might not know when I get there.

136
00:11:07.410 --> 00:11:10.950
I'll just keep adding these in where I feel like though be good.

137
00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:34.370
You can also go over some of these again just to get a darker edge on it.

138
00:11:34.400 --> 00:11:38.150
And you want him to start out that are at the bottom and then get thinner as they get to the top so

139
00:11:38.150 --> 00:11:39.570
you can add that in by hand.

140
00:11:39.580 --> 00:11:40.190
Also

141
00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:53.370
all right.

142
00:11:53.930 --> 00:11:58.670
Now let's go ahead and have a look at our eye and see if there's anything else we want to change.

143
00:11:58.670 --> 00:12:01.000
I think it's looking a little bit too light in some areas.

144
00:12:01.010 --> 00:12:04.540
So what I'm going to do is go ahead and add a little bit more shadowing.

145
00:12:04.700 --> 00:12:08.180
So places where we want to have more shadowing is like on this topic area

146
00:12:14.680 --> 00:12:18.080
and I also want to add some more shadowing up here.

147
00:12:18.210 --> 00:12:20.050
So go ahead and add that in

148
00:12:26.390 --> 00:12:29.180
in like I said this is what I'm talking about.

149
00:12:29.220 --> 00:12:31.240
Drawing is very much about working.

150
00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:35.870
You're drawing over and over again and adding more and more detail every time you go around and add

151
00:12:35.880 --> 00:12:37.460
detail.

152
00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:42.400
And then I'm going to add in some more here and here.

153
00:12:46.350 --> 00:12:48.050
Durcan this bottom area also

154
00:13:08.230 --> 00:13:08.930
great.

155
00:13:08.940 --> 00:13:13.590
Now the last thing I want to do is I want to add the reflection of my eyelashes.

156
00:13:13.620 --> 00:13:16.170
But on the actual eye itself.

157
00:13:16.170 --> 00:13:21.250
Now the reason why we're going to have this is because the eye is actually going to be picking this

158
00:13:21.450 --> 00:13:21.810
up.

159
00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:23.510
The actual eyelash itself.

160
00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:26.550
And that's why you're going to see it on the actual reflection.

161
00:13:26.550 --> 00:13:27.990
Now it's not going to be a reflection.

162
00:13:27.990 --> 00:13:30.320
It's going to be a lack of a reflection.

163
00:13:30.330 --> 00:13:36.090
So like for example vis eyelash Rick here it is going to be reflected right there like so we can do

164
00:13:36.090 --> 00:13:37.870
that again over here.

165
00:13:37.870 --> 00:13:40.410
And basically we're just going to redraw the eyelashes.

166
00:13:40.410 --> 00:13:46.320
But on the actual white part of our eye now is not going to show up in all places but it will show up

167
00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.380
in some of the places especially over here in this white area of the reflection.

168
00:13:51.390 --> 00:13:55.760
So you can see that right there you see those guys right there.

169
00:13:58.640 --> 00:13:59.110
Great.

170
00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.990
Now I'm going to take my research and erase some of that because I think I got a little bit too much

171
00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.000
of the eyelashes in there.

172
00:14:05.060 --> 00:14:05.810
Perfect.

173
00:14:05.810 --> 00:14:06.260
All right.

174
00:14:06.380 --> 00:14:08.900
So our eyes basically go on.

175
00:14:08.930 --> 00:14:12.880
So your first assignment for this course is to draw this up.

176
00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:17.030
Now I know it's probably going to be really difficult for some of you and for a lot of you probably

177
00:14:17.030 --> 00:14:18.130
won't look this good.

178
00:14:18.230 --> 00:14:19.170
That's OK.

179
00:14:19.220 --> 00:14:21.170
You're going to learn a ton in this course.

180
00:14:21.260 --> 00:14:23.050
And by the end you're going to be able to draw this.

181
00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:27.250
I and other look way way better than your first try.

182
00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.120
So go ahead and try this and then if you feel comfortable with it you can go ahead and post your eye

183
00:14:32.120 --> 00:14:36.290
drawn to the Q&amp;A section of the course or to the Facebook group.

184
00:14:36.320 --> 00:14:41.240
Now I'm not going to make you post this just because I know that for some of you it can be embarrassing.

185
00:14:41.390 --> 00:14:44.400
But later in the course you want to make sure that you start posting your work.

186
00:14:44.630 --> 00:14:49.600
That way you can start sharing your progress with people and it will very much motivate you.

187
00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:53.580
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.

188
00:14:53.690 --> 00:14:58.360
Well we're going to start going over the basics of wine and we'll even look at our drawing and see how

189
00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:00.350
you use the line in this strong.
