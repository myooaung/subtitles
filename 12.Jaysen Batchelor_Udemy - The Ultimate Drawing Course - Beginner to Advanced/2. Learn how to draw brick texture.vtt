00:00:00.770 --> 00:00:04.870
In today's lecture we're going to be creating a stone brick patter.

2
00:00:05.210 --> 00:00:07.280
So let's go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:13.520
So the first thing I want to do is I want to use my ruler to divide my paper up into each individual

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:14.370
brick.

5
00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:22.050
So I'm just going to go ahead and lay down my ruler like so an underscore to draw lines across like

6
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.870
this.

7
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:28.500
And I'm just going to do about eyeball the same distance for each one so them come down about the same

8
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:29.320
distance.

9
00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:36.600
Not too worried about it being perfect because in this study we're just trying to understand texture

10
00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:41.200
through highlights and values.

11
00:00:41.290 --> 00:00:41.870
Great.

12
00:00:41.930 --> 00:00:49.700
Then go ahead and I'm going to draw off the ends of these so I have a box to draw within.

13
00:00:49.810 --> 00:00:51.130
So something like that should be good.

14
00:00:51.130 --> 00:00:53.490
So we're going to be Creedon or break with in here.

15
00:00:53.590 --> 00:00:58.900
Now the next thing to know is that when you're creating texture it's very important to look at reference

16
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:05.020
so you can go google and search for whatever type of reference you want and then look at that reference

17
00:01:05.020 --> 00:01:06.630
and study the way it works.

18
00:01:06.670 --> 00:01:08.930
Look at where the highlights are and where the shadows are.

19
00:01:08.950 --> 00:01:12.120
Because overall that's what's going to make your texture.

20
00:01:12.130 --> 00:01:17.560
So looking at some reference of some brick the first thing I noticed is that it's broken up to individual

21
00:01:17.560 --> 00:01:17.910
brick.

22
00:01:17.910 --> 00:01:21.940
So you start adding those lines in like so.

23
00:01:22.150 --> 00:01:28.150
So I know where each individual break is the next thing I'm noticing is that then some bricks are really

24
00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:28.570
random.

25
00:01:28.570 --> 00:01:31.200
So I notice that there's some square bricks like so.

26
00:01:31.510 --> 00:01:35.350
And I also notice that none of the lines ever line up with another line.

27
00:01:35.380 --> 00:01:39.260
So they're always broken up like so.

28
00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.720
None of my add in another one are there and then another one here.

29
00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:49.210
I'll try another square one right there and then I'll have another piece right there.

30
00:01:50.610 --> 00:01:55.050
And then I'm going to start calling this pattern up here because I know that I won't line up with any

31
00:01:55.050 --> 00:01:56.620
lines if I do that.

32
00:01:57.060 --> 00:02:00.240
So for this one so I need to change that one up to a square.

33
00:02:00.690 --> 00:02:01.140
All right.

34
00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:01.590
Perfect.

35
00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:07.530
So now I have my way out for my Breck's the next thing I'm noticing is that the space in between each

36
00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:09.810
brick is darker than the brick itself.

37
00:02:09.810 --> 00:02:15.660
So now what I can do is I can go ahead and Durkan in those areas like so so I can start getting a base

38
00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:19.900
value for all of my bricks in the space between

39
00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.160
her grunt.

40
00:03:00.230 --> 00:03:04.910
The next thing I'm noticing is that each brick has different values so some of them are lighter and

41
00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:09.330
some of them aren't or someone to go ahead and break these bricks up into three different values.

42
00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:12.920
A darker value a mid value and a lighter value which will leave what.

43
00:03:13.070 --> 00:03:18.050
So going to go ahead and start with my darkest de-value and I'll just start to sketch in that value

44
00:03:18.050 --> 00:03:25.490
onto some random bricks shimmer and Durka value on this one too and maybe a darker one right here and

45
00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:27.590
I'll just continue to do this all the way down

46
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:41.600
then I'll go ahead and fill in my lighter value on some of these so I'll add in the lighter value one

47
00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:42.780
right here.

48
00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.510
Well I've going in right there and I might even add in a second one right next to it because we want

49
00:03:47.510 --> 00:03:59.900
this to be random as possible.

50
00:03:59.900 --> 00:04:00.430
All right.

51
00:04:00.470 --> 00:04:00.970
Great.

52
00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:04.160
So now we have the basic layout for our brick texture.

53
00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:08.720
Next thing we need to do is we need to start going in there with some real detail and some real highlight

54
00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.460
and shadows.

55
00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:14.480
So to switch over to a more sharpened pencil and what I want to do first is I want to start adding in

56
00:04:14.480 --> 00:04:16.670
my shadow coming from my break.

57
00:04:16.670 --> 00:04:22.250
So each one of these breaks are sitting within their own space and they're pushed out a little bit further

58
00:04:22.250 --> 00:04:24.140
than the space in between them.

59
00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.810
So that's causing a shadow underneath each one.

60
00:04:26.810 --> 00:04:28.900
So the shadow kind of looks like.

61
00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:35.300
So it's a cat shadow that's being cast underneath each one of my Rex and then I'm noticing that the

62
00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:37.480
light appears to be coming more from this direction.

63
00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:44.690
I to go ahead and add in shadow on that side and then I want to go ahead and slowly fade that in.

64
00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:47.080
So it's not such a hard line.

65
00:04:47.350 --> 00:04:49.920
And then I'm going to go ahead and do that to all of my bricks.

66
00:05:41.280 --> 00:05:41.760
All right.

67
00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:45.920
So now I've added in all of those cast shadows underneath my bricks.

68
00:05:45.930 --> 00:05:51.330
And on the left side of each brick the next thing I want to do is I want to start adding in some texturing

69
00:05:51.330 --> 00:05:54.310
detail in there which is going to be some dark shadows.

70
00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.700
And then after that I can go ahead and add in my midtown and then I can leave out all my highlights

71
00:05:59.790 --> 00:06:01.520
and that will really make it pop.

72
00:06:01.530 --> 00:06:03.210
So let's go ahead and get started with that.

73
00:06:03.210 --> 00:06:07.560
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to start drawing in some of the texture I see in my

74
00:06:07.560 --> 00:06:08.150
reference.

75
00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.390
And so it's just very sort of random sheeps in the brick.

76
00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:19.100
Now a lot of these bricks were made by hand or put into really crude molds.

77
00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:23.970
And so there's going to be a lot of Textron which is really nice for what we're trying to do.

78
00:07:31.430 --> 00:07:34.960
Great so now we finished all of that dark shadow and texture.

79
00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:39.490
The next thing we want to do is we want to add another layer of shadow onto each one of these bricks.

80
00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:45.000
But what we want to do is we want to leave out the space underneath each one of these for highlight.

81
00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:49.420
We also want to leave out the top edge on this break for highlight because since the light is coming

82
00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:53.250
from this angle it's going to be getting hit with the light on that side.

83
00:07:53.260 --> 00:07:54.940
So let's go ahead and do that.

84
00:07:54.960 --> 00:07:56.940
Let me show you what I mean before we get started.

85
00:07:57.130 --> 00:08:05.150
So basically we want to go ahead and add in a midtown shadow like so all the way up to the dark texture

86
00:08:05.170 --> 00:08:05.990
we have here.

87
00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:16.180
But then on this underside we want to leave out a good space for a highlight like so let's try another.

88
00:08:16.230 --> 00:08:21.900
So we bring the shadow right up to the edge of our dark texture and then we're going to leave out a

89
00:08:21.900 --> 00:08:25.380
space underneath that for a white highlight.

90
00:08:25.460 --> 00:08:27.170
Do the same thing for this one.

91
00:08:34.610 --> 00:08:38.500
And then let's not forget to leave a white highlight on the top of this brick.

92
00:08:38.510 --> 00:08:42.760
So we'll go ahead and fill right up to this line about there.

93
00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:45.930
We can even add a little bit darker of an edge right there.

94
00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:53.250
Same underneath each one of these highlights that where they stand out just a little bit more.

95
00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:53.930
All right.

96
00:08:54.030 --> 00:08:58.250
So now that really gives us some more three dimensional looks to our fabric.

97
00:08:58.420 --> 00:11:50.350
Let's go ahead and apply this to all of our Broks.

98
00:11:50.360 --> 00:11:50.930
All right.

99
00:11:50.930 --> 00:11:51.430
Great.

100
00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:57.920
So now we just added in that mid-tone and also added in our highlight underneath each one of these holes.

101
00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:03.170
And on the top of our Rick now the last thing I want to do to finish this off is add a little bit more

102
00:12:03.170 --> 00:12:05.350
random random texture in there.

103
00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:10.010
So it doesn't look so bland because right now it looks really fake.

104
00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:15.500
So the way we're going to fix it is just by adding some random texturing and by having dot circles all

105
00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:17.480
kinds of different things in their lines.

106
00:12:17.570 --> 00:12:19.460
But that's just going to help break it up.

107
00:12:19.460 --> 00:12:23.750
So it looks more realistic and has a lot more texture to it.

108
00:12:55.480 --> 00:12:57.090
Or out great.

109
00:12:57.110 --> 00:12:59.640
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

110
00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:05.390
So in this lecture we learn how to create a realistic brick texture for our drawings.

111
00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:10.010
So just remember that you want to make sure that you use reference when you're creating texture and

112
00:13:10.010 --> 00:13:13.700
also remember that there are three parts to your texture.

113
00:13:13.850 --> 00:13:20.240
There is the core Chateau the mid-tone shadow and you highlight so incorporate these three values and

114
00:13:20.270 --> 00:13:24.520
you will always get a realistic looking texture if you do.

115
00:13:24.530 --> 00:13:28.430
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one where we're going

116
00:13:28.430 --> 00:13:30.710
to create some wood texture.
