00:00:00.820 --> 00:00:06.270
Aren't in this lecture we're going to go ahead and do a character design and we're going to create this

2
00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:13.200
character out of super simple geometric shapes just like we did in our last video lecture and then we're

3
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:18.500
going to take those shapes and turn them into organic shapes and then add detail on top of that.

4
00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:20.730
So let's go ahead and get started.

5
00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:26.580
So I'm going to start off by making a square from a character's head like so and then I want to make

6
00:00:26.580 --> 00:00:29.740
a rectangle for his body or her body.

7
00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:32.860
I'm not sure whether it's going to be a he or she.

8
00:00:33.270 --> 00:00:35.770
And then I want to create the legs for my character.

9
00:00:35.770 --> 00:00:41.490
So I want to first off create one character or rectangle like so and then I'll make a triangle coming

10
00:00:41.490 --> 00:00:44.950
off like so for the calf and then I'll do the other leg.

11
00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.570
So I'll do one rectangle like so and then another triangle like so and then I'm going to add in some

12
00:00:51.570 --> 00:00:52.570
sort of a feat.

13
00:00:52.650 --> 00:00:56.190
So maybe some sort of a small rectangle.

14
00:00:56.190 --> 00:00:59.020
And next I'm going to go ahead and add in the arm.

15
00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:01.540
So my arm is going to be like this.

16
00:01:01.560 --> 00:01:03.040
And then a triangle.

17
00:01:03.330 --> 00:01:08.370
And then we'll have another one on this side and it's going to be lugging along a sword.

18
00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:13.650
So I'm going have a rectangle for the handle right there and then I'll have one big rectangle that will

19
00:01:13.650 --> 00:01:14.920
be the sword blade.

20
00:01:15.030 --> 00:01:18.760
But for now I'm just going to leave as one big rectangle.

21
00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:24.870
So there are basic she's going to bring my square head down just a little bit to about there.

22
00:01:24.870 --> 00:01:29.580
And this is why we do it in blue is so that it's a lot lighter so we can make changes later.

23
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:37.400
Next let's go ahead and add in some more details so I'm ad in the neck then.

24
00:01:37.420 --> 00:01:40.590
Let's go ahead and smooth the shape out of the torso.

25
00:01:40.750 --> 00:01:42.810
So it's not just a square block.

26
00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:46.970
We'll add in some more detail onto the hands

27
00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:56.040
and then we want to add more detail on the character's face.

28
00:01:56.220 --> 00:02:02.100
So I'm going to start off by adding some years and then I'll add it you're over here and then I'm going

29
00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:06.770
to round off the top of the head a bit just like so.

30
00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.890
And I'm going to keep the bottom part very square then.

31
00:02:11.920 --> 00:02:15.020
Let's go ahead and fatten this rectangle up a little bit more.

32
00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:23.380
So it looks more like a laid and then I can bring her legs more up into her body shape then.

33
00:02:23.410 --> 00:02:26.890
Let's go ahead and shape this sword blade out.

34
00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.130
So it's going to come down like this.

35
00:02:29.380 --> 00:02:30.680
The ground will be about.

36
00:02:30.740 --> 00:02:35.530
They're going to slice it off right there and then I'll add another slice right there.

37
00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:41.020
So now we're getting more of a sort of shape then I'm going to put a line right down the middle.

38
00:02:41.980 --> 00:02:44.630
So that's one plain and then the other plain.

39
00:02:45.040 --> 00:02:51.190
And then we can add in the guard on this sword great next.

40
00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:55.160
Let's go ahead and add in a little bit more detail onto the face.

41
00:02:55.190 --> 00:03:00.980
So an ad and I eyebrow there and one right there just very simple shapes.

42
00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:03.230
And then I'm add some hair.

43
00:03:03.370 --> 00:03:11.430
So I'm going to add in some bangs first and then I'm going to go ahead and add in some pigtails.

44
00:03:13.290 --> 00:03:19.920
So that will be one bunch of hair going into one ponytail or pigtail and pigtails are basically just

45
00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:25.920
going to be circles or ovals and then off of those you're going to add a little bit of a curl coming

46
00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:32.560
off of it or curve just like so great.

47
00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:38.820
Now let's go ahead and grab our dirt pencil and add in some more detail and solidify these lines.

48
00:03:39.020 --> 00:03:44.420
So first off I'm going to go head and ground off my character by adding a shadow underneath her.

49
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:49.220
So I might add a little bit more and then I want to start with her face.

50
00:03:49.310 --> 00:03:54.840
So I want to create this shape right there and I'm going to round off that job just a little bit since

51
00:03:54.860 --> 00:04:00.810
she's a girl and then I'm going to go ahead and add in some eyelashes on to her eyes.

52
00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:12.520
And then we can go ahead and add in her bottom eyelashes just like so.

53
00:04:12.830 --> 00:04:14.920
And now I want to add in her eyes.

54
00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:19.860
So I'm going to add in one right there and then add and another one right there.

55
00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:26.600
And then I can go ahead and fill those in and leaving a small little spot for a row of reflection

56
00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:31.660
and then I'm going to go ahead and do her nose.

57
00:04:31.690 --> 00:04:37.990
So it's just going to be a small little circle oval like so then her mouth is just going to be a small

58
00:04:37.990 --> 00:04:40.120
little line.

59
00:04:40.210 --> 00:04:42.710
Now let's go ahead and move on to the eyebrows.

60
00:04:45.250 --> 00:04:47.630
And then we can go ahead and do her hair.

61
00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:54.800
So she's going to be a simple half circle will some lines in there to show each individual hair.

62
00:04:54.820 --> 00:04:57.760
So there are her bangs.

63
00:04:57.850 --> 00:05:00.340
And now let's go ahead and add these pigtails.

64
00:05:00.340 --> 00:05:02.490
So the first one is going to go right here.

65
00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:08.040
Now we can go ahead and add in that you're And again I'm not trying to make it perfect character right

66
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:08.670
now.

67
00:05:08.820 --> 00:05:19.000
I'm just trying to demonstrate to you guys how shapes are used to create characters.

68
00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:21.780
Go ahead and add a circle right there.

69
00:05:22.330 --> 00:05:23.550
And those hairlines

70
00:05:30.190 --> 00:05:36.470
and even these hairlines or cross contouring lines and then I had a little bit of a blush on her cheeks

71
00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:39.910
maybe a little bit across her nose too.

72
00:05:39.910 --> 00:05:46.670
And then I'm a go ahead and add in her neck and then I'll go ahead and add in her body.

73
00:05:46.940 --> 00:05:50.190
And I'm trying to think of what type of costume I want her to be wearing.

74
00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:52.790
I think she's going to be wearing a big sweatshirt.

75
00:05:52.850 --> 00:05:54.320
So I'm going to go ahead and add that in.

76
00:05:54.320 --> 00:05:59.280
So there's her neckline and then there's the bottom of her sweatshirt.

77
00:05:59.380 --> 00:06:05.740
There's the band on her sweatshirt and then it's going to come up into her sleeves which are going to

78
00:06:05.740 --> 00:06:11.500
be really big and puffy like so I'll have another one right there.

79
00:06:12.310 --> 00:06:18.760
And then they'll be a band on the arms or the wrists and we'll have her hands that are holding the sword.

80
00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:21.750
Then let's go ahead and draw in the sword garb.

81
00:06:23.010 --> 00:06:25.100
So add that in there.

82
00:06:25.980 --> 00:06:27.720
And then we have the shape of our blade.

83
00:06:27.780 --> 00:06:29.480
So we'll go ahead and draw that in.

84
00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.300
And whoops I got that off just a little bit.

85
00:06:32.310 --> 00:06:37.920
So I need to fix that and then I'm gonna go ahead and Durkan in this bottom area.

86
00:06:39.170 --> 00:06:46.110
Since it's probably in shadow and then let's go ahead and add in her pants.

87
00:06:46.150 --> 00:06:48.610
So go ahead and darken those lines.

88
00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.390
Very simple straight lines.

89
00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:56.860
And then I'm going to add in a little bit more of a calf in there by popping out that back a little

90
00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:59.390
bit more.

91
00:06:59.550 --> 00:07:01.330
And then her feet are going to be really simple.

92
00:07:01.340 --> 00:07:03.720
I'm not going to get into too much detail with her shoes.

93
00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:08.020
We're just going to be very small.

94
00:07:08.170 --> 00:07:13.390
So you'll also notice that there's a lot of different line quality in here especially on the eyes and

95
00:07:13.390 --> 00:07:19.420
her eyebrows they have different thicknesses and different parts of her hair can have different line

96
00:07:19.420 --> 00:07:19.810
quality.

97
00:07:19.810 --> 00:07:25.840
Also we can also go ahead and trace out the entire outside sheath of her which would be her contouring

98
00:07:25.930 --> 00:07:29.630
lines which goes all the way around her forearm.

99
00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:32.050
This will make her stand out a lot more

100
00:07:35.170 --> 00:07:40.180
and you'll see this lying cartoons where the outline the entire outside of a character.

101
00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:52.990
Especially on this sword.

102
00:07:53.030 --> 00:07:54.600
We wanted to stand out a lot

103
00:07:59.180 --> 00:08:01.860
and then we can even add in some values in there.

104
00:08:03.010 --> 00:08:05.220
Which you'll learn about here in the next few lectures.

105
00:08:05.230 --> 00:08:07.870
But for now let's just go ahead and fill those in.

106
00:08:07.870 --> 00:08:10.670
So we have a couple of different values in our drawing

107
00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.590
that I might add some cross country lines right there.

108
00:08:17.590 --> 00:08:24.100
And you'll notice that my cross country lines on my sleeve and the form of my torso are going in different

109
00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:29.870
directions because they're creating that form of her body and arm.

110
00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:36.400
Then lastly I'm going to go ahead and Durkan in her feet to a nice black.

111
00:08:36.550 --> 00:08:37.740
All right cool.

112
00:08:37.750 --> 00:08:40.220
So now we have a really awesome character design.

113
00:08:40.420 --> 00:08:44.210
And as you can see these are just broken down into very simple shapes.

114
00:08:44.380 --> 00:08:46.160
And then we built it up from there.

115
00:08:46.300 --> 00:08:50.100
So every time you're trying to create a character design just go with your ideas.

116
00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:55.510
And once you have an idea in mind it's tried drawing it with these simple shapes before you do anything

117
00:08:55.510 --> 00:08:56.380
else.

118
00:08:56.380 --> 00:08:59.910
This is going to make your character designs look way way better.

119
00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:01.890
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

120
00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.740
I really hope you learn something from this.

121
00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:07.010
And I really look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.

122
00:09:07.030 --> 00:09:08.950
We're we're going to learn about form.
