1
00:00:00,570 --> 00:00:06,750
Overlooked in this lecture we're going to go ahead and do one more example of using form to draw out

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:08,980
the base of our drawings.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,880
So what we're going to be drawn in this lecture is the landscape and it's going up mountains and trees

4
00:00:14,940 --> 00:00:18,630
and we want to break those down into simple geometric forms.

5
00:00:18,630 --> 00:00:20,400
So let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,580
The first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to decide where my horizon line is now horizon line is

7
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:27,740
just the line between the sky and the earth.

8
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,470
So that's going to be my horizon line right there.

9
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:34,380
Next I need to decide where I want the mountains.

10
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:40,790
So I'm going to make my mountains sort of pyramid shapes so I'm going to make one right about here.

11
00:00:46,720 --> 00:00:49,400
So and then I'll put a second one right next to it.

12
00:00:52,800 --> 00:01:02,420
It's just like so that I'm going to put a shape over here that sort of connects into the shape and little

13
00:01:02,420 --> 00:01:07,100
sister sort of be rounded cube type of shape so that has its top surface right there.

14
00:01:09,480 --> 00:01:13,910
And then I'm going to add another surface behind this mountain.

15
00:01:14,070 --> 00:01:17,080
You get a view of that plane right there.

16
00:01:17,160 --> 00:01:18,410
All right cool.

17
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:24,270
Now let's go ahead and add the foreground so I'm going to go ahead and draw a line right about here

18
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:29,760
to represent my foreground and my actually slowed up a little bit on this site and then I'm want to

19
00:01:29,760 --> 00:01:31,710
go ahead and add another mountain over here.

20
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,810
So go ahead and draw on the second pyramid.

21
00:01:36,510 --> 00:01:37,840
Just like so.

22
00:01:38,170 --> 00:01:38,570
All right.

23
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:39,710
Perfect.

24
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,480
So now we have the basic set up for our landscape drawing.

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:46,320
The next thing we want to do is we want to start adding in that detail.

26
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,240
So first off I'm going to decide where my light source is coming from.

27
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:54,650
So I want to put my light source coming from up here down in this direction.

28
00:01:54,660 --> 00:01:58,250
So it's going to be hitting the surface and the surface as my highlights.

29
00:01:58,260 --> 00:02:07,440
So I'm going to leave those bright white and then I'm go ahead and shade in the side areas with my mid-tone.

30
00:02:08,490 --> 00:02:14,050
And in this case both of these are going to be my highlighted areas of this background.

31
00:02:14,460 --> 00:02:23,310
And then with this when I can go ahead and shade this side with my midtown then also Let's go ahead

32
00:02:23,310 --> 00:02:24,530
and add a tree in here.

33
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:27,220
So I think I want to have my tree in right here.

34
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:33,360
So let's go ahead and draw a cylinder like so and then I'm going to draw a sphere on top of that to

35
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:35,960
represent the leaves of my tree.

36
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:38,010
And then I can go ahead and shade that in

37
00:02:43,870 --> 00:02:47,550
next I'm going to go ahead in work on the reflection of my mountains.

38
00:02:47,590 --> 00:02:50,440
So this area right here is going to be a lake.

39
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:53,660
So I want to create a reflection of these forms.

40
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,810
So what I want to do is go ahead and just copy them but flip them upside down so I have that line going

41
00:02:58,810 --> 00:03:00,060
from there to there.

42
00:03:00,340 --> 00:03:02,140
And then this line would connect back here.

43
00:03:02,140 --> 00:03:04,210
So I have it coming from there.

44
00:03:04,660 --> 00:03:06,800
And this one would come down to about there.

45
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:08,770
So all of this would come from there to there.

46
00:03:08,950 --> 00:03:11,800
So then I can go ahead and try this one.

47
00:03:11,800 --> 00:03:12,970
I should have done this one first.

48
00:03:12,980 --> 00:03:14,930
It was in front of that other one.

49
00:03:15,310 --> 00:03:16,800
So there we go.

50
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:22,300
And then I'm going to go ahead and shoot in this area because you'll be able to see that visually behind

51
00:03:22,390 --> 00:03:24,460
this reflection of the mountain.

52
00:03:24,460 --> 00:03:24,850
All right.

53
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,660
Perfect.

54
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:29,140
So now we can go ahead and start adding in some detail.

55
00:03:29,140 --> 00:03:33,250
So the first thing I want to do is I want to start adding some more detail to these mountains so I might

56
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:36,280
add some more rigidly edges to my mountains.

57
00:03:41,570 --> 00:03:49,960
On this one might even come more out like so.

58
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,850
And this might get some.

59
00:03:53,240 --> 00:03:55,590
The sky might be received a little bit

60
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,650
and definitely get some reshaping.

61
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:06,970
Perfect.

62
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:13,480
Now let's go ahead and switch over to our dark pencil and now we can go ahead and start adding in some

63
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:14,470
real detail.

64
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,830
So starting with my background mountain I'm going to search this guy.

65
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:29,480
So first I just want to draw out the outline of my mountain.

66
00:04:30,130 --> 00:04:31,930
It doesn't get down to the bottom.

67
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:33,950
It's not just going to be a straight line.

68
00:04:34,440 --> 00:04:39,100
It's going to be a little bit more of a shape to the bottom here.

69
00:04:42,420 --> 00:04:48,720
And then this edge here of the mountain is also not going to be a straight line will be some more to

70
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,340
that shape than just that straight line.

71
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:54,130
So it might be a little bit more bent and skew aka's.

72
00:04:54,490 --> 00:05:00,090
And then we can go ahead and shade in that area and we'll come back and add a little bit more detail

73
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,480
to this texturing on the mountain.

74
00:05:01,470 --> 00:05:05,580
So it's not just one solid form with two planes.

75
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:08,850
Let's go ahead and move on to our next mountain.

76
00:05:09,390 --> 00:05:12,080
So we'll draw out the contouring line so this mountain

77
00:05:18,990 --> 00:05:20,610
you can draw this.

78
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:22,090
Perfect.

79
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:23,500
Now let's go ahead and

80
00:05:26,530 --> 00:05:35,930
create that bottom line of our mountain so that we can go ahead and add ins or shading on the side.

81
00:05:41,380 --> 00:05:42,690
Perfect.

82
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:44,540
Now let's move on to this back area.

83
00:05:44,710 --> 00:05:50,680
So I want to draw this a little bit lighter just because the further away things get in real life the

84
00:05:50,680 --> 00:05:51,710
lighter they become.

85
00:05:51,730 --> 00:05:53,900
So I don't hold that line to be too dark.

86
00:05:54,460 --> 00:05:56,720
And then I'll move onto this guy here.

87
00:05:57,310 --> 00:06:00,940
So this guy needs to be a lot more of a organic ex-chief.

88
00:06:01,150 --> 00:06:04,050
Otherwise it's just going to look like a big one up the hill.

89
00:06:04,150 --> 00:06:08,220
So I want to go ahead and sort of ADD and some rocky sort of a sheep to that

90
00:06:16,420 --> 00:06:17,050
thought.

91
00:06:17,080 --> 00:06:18,250
Perfect.

92
00:06:18,260 --> 00:06:22,190
Now let's go ahead and add in are other mountain over here.

93
00:06:22,340 --> 00:06:24,000
So draw this country line

94
00:06:27,980 --> 00:06:29,930
and we'll have this Erich's year.

95
00:06:30,110 --> 00:06:35,130
It's then we want to add this edge of our For around.

96
00:06:35,130 --> 00:06:36,940
And I think I want it to be made out of grass.

97
00:06:36,950 --> 00:06:37,290
Some of.

98
00:06:37,290 --> 00:06:41,090
Go ahead and add on sort of grassy going to that.

99
00:07:08,310 --> 00:07:09,220
All right perfect.

100
00:07:09,220 --> 00:07:11,460
Now I want to move on to this story.

101
00:07:11,630 --> 00:07:15,410
Someone to go ahead and start with the trunk of the tree.

102
00:07:15,620 --> 00:07:20,210
So you have a basic cylinder here but we can go ahead and add some roots to that to make a look a lot

103
00:07:20,210 --> 00:07:21,660
more realistic.

104
00:07:31,310 --> 00:07:35,900
And then I'm going to go ahead and add my leaves and so my leaves are just going to be one big basic

105
00:07:35,990 --> 00:07:39,880
sort of a geometrical form but a little bit more organic.

106
00:07:40,780 --> 00:07:44,550
But I don't want to do every individual leaf because I'll take too long.

107
00:07:52,040 --> 00:07:53,620
So there's my truth.

108
00:07:53,630 --> 00:07:56,590
Now let's go ahead and add in this country line on this mountain.

109
00:07:56,630 --> 00:07:58,250
Go ahead and shoot that in

110
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:25,230
this.

111
00:08:26,460 --> 00:08:28,860
Let's go ahead and ask who shading on those trees.

112
00:08:28,860 --> 00:08:33,540
So since a light source is coming down from here we're going to get some cast shadow shadow We're going

113
00:08:33,540 --> 00:08:35,790
to get some mid-tone colors on this side.

114
00:08:35,820 --> 00:08:37,470
So let's go ahead and shake that in

115
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,000
as this tree curves around we're going to see just a little bit of that foreshadow some moment of really

116
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,020
dirt some of these just over here on the side

117
00:09:38,770 --> 00:09:39,370
next.

118
00:09:39,370 --> 00:09:43,200
Let's go ahead and decide where are cast shadows are going to be.

119
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:45,120
So if the lights come from the side.

120
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:49,980
First off there's going to be a cache showing cast by this book of the leaves onto our trunk.

121
00:09:50,110 --> 00:09:51,880
So let's go ahead and add that in.

122
00:09:51,950 --> 00:09:55,560
So probably going to be cast down to about there.

123
00:09:56,020 --> 00:10:02,170
So and then the whole tree itself is going to be cast and shadow off in this direction.

124
00:10:02,170 --> 00:10:03,400
So let's go out and add that.

125
00:10:03,460 --> 00:10:08,310
So basically we just want to draw the tree shape coming off in this direction.

126
00:10:14,110 --> 00:10:19,380
So so and then we can go ahead and fill that in with our cast show.

127
00:10:19,420 --> 00:10:20,160
So you

128
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:46,550
the next let's move on to the trunk.

129
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,410
So if the lights come from this side we're going to get our core shadow on this side of the trunk and

130
00:10:51,560 --> 00:10:55,840
that's going to slowly fade into our mid-tone and then into highlight.

131
00:10:56,260 --> 00:10:59,640
Because it's a cylindrical type of shape.

132
00:11:00,440 --> 00:11:02,860
Of a shadow this side of that route.

133
00:11:08,750 --> 00:11:10,710
Perfect next.

134
00:11:10,730 --> 00:11:14,560
Let's go ahead and move onto this mountain and add some more detail to it.

135
00:11:14,570 --> 00:11:19,230
So if the light is coming from up here at the top we might have some undercuts in our mountains.

136
00:11:19,230 --> 00:11:23,450
So for example right about here we might have a little bit darker shadow

137
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:36,250
I'll just start creating more of an interesting form for us in our rocky mountain.

138
00:11:39,650 --> 00:11:45,970
Same for shear.

139
00:11:46,280 --> 00:11:46,610
It's

140
00:11:53,310 --> 00:11:59,130
know here on this side we might have some good times creating the same thing that we have over here.

141
00:11:59,330 --> 00:12:05,610
So we might have a couple of undercuts.

142
00:12:06,460 --> 00:12:11,930
Nonetheless go ahead and move on to these mountains going to grab a piece of paper to lay on top of

143
00:12:11,930 --> 00:12:12,370
us.

144
00:12:12,390 --> 00:12:14,830
So as I'm drawing I don't smudge it.

145
00:12:15,150 --> 00:12:19,860
So this is a really good trick to know is if you don't want to smudge your drawings make sure you play

146
00:12:19,860 --> 00:12:23,660
a piece of paper down or paper towel for your hand to rest on.

147
00:12:24,030 --> 00:12:28,760
So let's go ahead and get started with this mountain.

148
00:12:28,890 --> 00:12:31,050
I have a few hundred cuts in here.

149
00:12:31,520 --> 00:12:33,370
And these small holes

150
00:12:36,410 --> 00:12:41,760
and then this mountain sort of curves around it's going to get a little tiny bit of that core shadow

151
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:43,650
on the edge.

152
00:12:43,650 --> 00:12:48,080
We can also sort of fade this mid-tone into this area.

153
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:06,300
Six months you go into this mountain

154
00:13:42,450 --> 00:13:48,060
and we can move on to the Skydeck here and he's going to have very light detail because he's so far

155
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:48,770
away.

156
00:13:49,080 --> 00:13:52,530
So like I said the further something is a way that lighter is going to be

157
00:14:02,310 --> 00:14:07,340
session work and we can move on to this rocky plane right here.

158
00:14:07,410 --> 00:14:12,480
And so the light is coming from the side but we might be getting some shadows on the other side of let's

159
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:17,850
say some of these rocks so if there's a rock right here we're probably going to be getting a shadow

160
00:14:17,850 --> 00:14:19,340
on this side of that rock.

161
00:14:24,300 --> 00:14:32,430
So we can just add in see stuff like that.

162
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,350
Now I'm not looking at any reference for this drawing I'm just drawing out of my head.

163
00:14:36,530 --> 00:14:42,200
But if you were to be drawing a landscape like this let's say for a fantasy comic book or something

164
00:14:42,920 --> 00:14:46,810
you'd really want to look at some reference so that you can really understand how rocks work.

165
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:52,070
I'm just doing this for demonstration purposes to show you how to create form and highlights and shadows

166
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:54,890
in a landscape by using geometrical shapes.

167
00:14:56,300 --> 00:14:58,140
So for now this work fine.

168
00:15:19,430 --> 00:15:49,630
Then as this piece curves around we're going to start seeing more of that mid-tone shadow.

169
00:15:49,850 --> 00:15:50,300
All right.

170
00:15:50,360 --> 00:15:51,780
Cool.

171
00:15:51,780 --> 00:15:55,740
Now lastly I'm going to go ahead and add and this is reflection.

172
00:15:55,790 --> 00:15:59,380
So I just want to copy the same shape that I've created here.

173
00:16:05,720 --> 00:16:10,430
Whoops I just realized that I accidentally drew over this mountain so you want to make sure we erase

174
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:11,550
that.

175
00:16:11,700 --> 00:16:13,050
You don't want to see that part of it.

176
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:23,400
We go up this mountain to be coming in front like so only that out then we can go ahead and copy these

177
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:24,390
reflections over

178
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:02,440
and then just to differentiate the difference between our highlight and our shadow government or go

179
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:05,620
ahead and add a dark edge along the bottom of our mountain.

180
00:17:05,620 --> 00:17:08,890
So how did it just right there.

181
00:17:09,030 --> 00:17:14,020
I'm going to add that all the way along the bottom and that's going to allow us to see the difference

182
00:17:14,020 --> 00:17:18,840
between our reflection and the actual mountain itself.

183
00:17:26,680 --> 00:17:29,940
Our options I think this looks pretty good now.

184
00:17:29,970 --> 00:17:31,100
It can be a lot better.

185
00:17:31,110 --> 00:17:33,060
And look way more realistic.

186
00:17:33,060 --> 00:17:38,370
But like I said I just wanted to demonstrate to you how to take geometrical three dimensional forms

187
00:17:38,730 --> 00:17:44,910
and use those to block out your images your landscapes your characters whatever it might be and then

188
00:17:44,910 --> 00:17:46,470
build on top of that.

189
00:17:46,500 --> 00:17:48,740
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

190
00:17:48,990 --> 00:17:54,390
So your assignment for this lecture is to go outside and look at the landscape around you whether you're

191
00:17:54,390 --> 00:17:57,540
in a city or you're in the mountains.

192
00:17:57,540 --> 00:18:00,090
And I want you to go ahead and draw what you see.

193
00:18:00,330 --> 00:18:05,400
Except I want you to draw it out of geometrical forms and then I don't want you to add any detail to

194
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:10,470
it just draw the geometrical forms and that's it because we're watching this lecture and I look forward

195
00:18:10,470 --> 00:18:12,390
to seeing you in the next one.
