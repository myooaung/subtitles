00:00:01.020 --> 00:00:08.610
All right in this lecture we're going to learn how to add values and highlights and shadows to our forms.

2
00:00:08.630 --> 00:00:14.630
So the first form we're going to go over with this on is the cue because this is the most simple form

3
00:00:14.690 --> 00:00:16.000
to do this on.

4
00:00:16.010 --> 00:00:24.470
So let's start off by drawing or so we'll draw our simple square and we'll draw our lines coming off

5
00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:30.600
and then we'll just go ahead and quickly connect those up.

6
00:00:30.620 --> 00:00:32.520
So there's our simple cube.

7
00:00:32.810 --> 00:00:37.550
The first thing you want to do when you're creating highlights and shadows is you need to decide where

8
00:00:37.550 --> 00:00:39.320
your light source is coming from.

9
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.400
So in this case we're going to have our light source coming from this site.

10
00:00:43.430 --> 00:00:45.290
Someone to dramatize sort of right there.

11
00:00:45.470 --> 00:00:48.730
And it's going to be hitting our cube from that angle.

12
00:00:48.770 --> 00:00:53.410
So the first thing we know is that we know that this top surface is going to be our highlight.

13
00:00:53.420 --> 00:00:58.740
That means that it's going to be the brightest area the next area that's going to be brightest is this

14
00:00:59.330 --> 00:01:02.200
which is going to be our mid-tone shadow.

15
00:01:02.390 --> 00:01:08.210
And then our core shadow which is the dark shadow is going to be this side right here and we know that

16
00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:13.390
this side is going to be our dark shadow because it's only opposite side of our source of light.

17
00:01:13.460 --> 00:01:16.240
So let's start by filling in our core chÃ¢teaux.

18
00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:19.670
It's going to go ahead and fill in this area with very dark pencil

19
00:01:29.790 --> 00:01:30.630
gripped.

20
00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.450
Dennis let's go ahead and fill in our mid-tone shot.

21
00:01:34.500 --> 00:01:40.200
Now the reason why it's called mid-tone is because it is the middle tone between our core shadow and

22
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:41.190
our highlight.

23
00:01:41.190 --> 00:01:46.040
So we want to get a gray in there that somewhere in between this dark color and this white.

24
00:01:46.110 --> 00:01:54.690
So probably somewhere about here should be good.

25
00:01:54.820 --> 00:01:55.750
Perfect.

26
00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:58.580
So now we have our light source.

27
00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:02.090
So this is our light source right here.

28
00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.850
And then we have our Heilbrunn.

29
00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:06.110
So this right here is our highlight

30
00:02:10.240 --> 00:02:12.880
and then we have our mid-tone.

31
00:02:12.880 --> 00:02:14.950
So this right here is our mid-tone

32
00:02:17.730 --> 00:02:19.470
and then we have our core shadows.

33
00:02:19.480 --> 00:02:28.630
So this right here is our core shadow.

34
00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:32.930
Now there's one last shadow we have to add in here before it's complete.

35
00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:34.870
And that's our cast shadow.

36
00:02:34.890 --> 00:02:40.450
So what our cast shadow is is it's just the shadow that's cast off of our sheep and onto the surface

37
00:02:40.450 --> 00:02:44.160
of it sitting on.

38
00:02:44.330 --> 00:02:51.350
So it would basically be coming off like so and then we can go ahead and fill that in with the darker

39
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:51.960
value.

40
00:02:51.980 --> 00:02:55.820
And we usually want to cash other to be darker than our mid-tone shadow

41
00:03:02.890 --> 00:03:05.010
and we can just fill that in like so.

42
00:03:05.260 --> 00:03:10.030
And the further away we get from the object the lighter our shadow is going to become.

43
00:03:10.030 --> 00:03:15.490
Now a really good example of a cast shadows you can understand this better is let's say that we have

44
00:03:15.490 --> 00:03:17.000
somebody who knows your AK

45
00:03:22.070 --> 00:03:24.920
So there's somebody that knows right there.

46
00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:30.290
Now whenever somebody standing out in the sun they usually are going to get a cast shadow being cast

47
00:03:30.290 --> 00:03:34.220
from their nose so their nose ticks off kind of like the number seven.

48
00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.990
It's going to cast a shadow on their upper lip area and sometimes even onto their chins.

49
00:03:39.110 --> 00:03:46.020
And so this nose right here is going to cast a shadow down like so and then we can go ahead and fill

50
00:03:46.020 --> 00:03:47.300
a cast chateau in

51
00:03:51.550 --> 00:03:54.510
but you've probably seen this before it's probably pretty familiar looking.

52
00:03:54.510 --> 00:03:57.150
Is that cast shutter right there from the nose.

53
00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.330
That's the same exact thing that this is another example of a cast shadow is if you have a tree.

54
00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:05.820
Right.

55
00:04:05.910 --> 00:04:08.420
And then on the ground you have the roots.

56
00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:14.510
You very often see a shadow coming off the tree that's in the same shape as the tree.

57
00:04:16.060 --> 00:04:17.640
It's been cast from the sun.

58
00:04:17.890 --> 00:04:21.400
Well this is also a cast a shadow.

59
00:04:21.420 --> 00:04:24.820
Now let's go ahead and apply this to a few more shapes.

60
00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.810
So let's try applying this to a cone.

61
00:04:26.820 --> 00:04:32.660
So let's quickly draw Council draw my base and then I'll draw my triangle.

62
00:04:32.710 --> 00:04:36.620
It's a little bit crooked but that's all right.

63
00:04:36.810 --> 00:04:38.470
So there is our cone.

64
00:04:38.670 --> 00:04:43.710
So the first thing we want to do is we want to go ahead and find our light source so our light source

65
00:04:43.710 --> 00:04:47.310
is going to be coming from this side this time and hitting it from this angle.

66
00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:52.050
So we know that this side is going to be getting hit by a bunch of light and the side is not.

67
00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:55.620
So we can start with this side and add in our core shadow.

68
00:04:55.780 --> 00:04:58.640
Now sense a cone is a rounded shape.

69
00:04:58.650 --> 00:04:59.630
There are no edges.

70
00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.960
And so we're not going to see any hard lines between our core shadow or mid-tone and our highlight.

71
00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.790
It's all going to be one gradual gradient from one tone to the next.

72
00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:13.450
So that's probably our core shadow right there.

73
00:05:13.470 --> 00:05:20.360
And then it slowly fades into our mid-tone right about here and then that's going to slowly fade in

74
00:05:20.420 --> 00:05:29.640
to our height like so when you go and fill us in a little bit better.

75
00:05:30.270 --> 00:05:33.380
But that's basically how you light a rounded object.

76
00:05:33.660 --> 00:05:37.800
You want to really have soft gradients from one tone to another.

77
00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.570
Now let's try another example with the cone because this is also another interesting thing to look at.

78
00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:45.630
So let's draw another one here.

79
00:05:49.020 --> 00:05:53.370
And then let's see that our light source is coming from right here behind our cone.

80
00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:54.650
Well what does this mean.

81
00:05:54.680 --> 00:06:00.350
Well that means that this edge right here is going to be getting some light as well as this edge because

82
00:06:00.350 --> 00:06:02.380
the light is on the other side of our county.

83
00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.020
We can't see it.

84
00:06:03.020 --> 00:06:05.290
We're going to basically see a whole bunch of shadow.

85
00:06:05.450 --> 00:06:10.310
But some of that light is going to barely seep around the edge and we'll see a little bit of that highlight.

86
00:06:10.310 --> 00:06:16.400
So what we want to do is we want to start off by adding our core shadow right down the middle of our

87
00:06:16.400 --> 00:06:16.870
cone.

88
00:06:16.910 --> 00:06:21.980
And the more towards the top against the skin of that Korsh out it will get convert that that little

89
00:06:21.980 --> 00:06:27.310
bit more than we want to go ahead and add in our mid-tone shadow.

90
00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:29.050
So at that end like so.

91
00:06:29.060 --> 00:06:35.600
Like I said keep these edges out that way you get a little bit of that highlight coming around the edge

92
00:06:35.660 --> 00:06:38.200
but you slowly want to blend these in together.

93
00:06:38.210 --> 00:06:41.950
So from a mid-tone to our highlight.

94
00:06:43.330 --> 00:06:48.860
And then we might want to slowly blend our dark shadow into our mid-tone also

95
00:06:53.950 --> 00:06:54.870
like so.

96
00:06:55.310 --> 00:06:56.670
So there's a name for this.

97
00:06:56.680 --> 00:06:59.340
This type of like this is called backlighting.

98
00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:04.660
So maybe you've seen this before on a TV show where they're doing an interview with somebody let's say

99
00:07:04.670 --> 00:07:10.310
you have somebody sitting there and that's their head and they'll sometimes put a light on the side

100
00:07:10.310 --> 00:07:13.300
of them or even behind them and a little backlight.

101
00:07:13.310 --> 00:07:18.690
And so you'll get a really bright white edge along the edge of their face and their body.

102
00:07:18.710 --> 00:07:19.740
This is backlighting.

103
00:07:19.790 --> 00:07:23.930
It's the same thing we just did on this comb and it's a very good thing to understand because it can

104
00:07:23.930 --> 00:07:27.680
help you create a really good artwork and very good contrast.

105
00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.120
Now let's try another shape so let's try the pure.

106
00:07:31.190 --> 00:07:38.270
So first off let's go ahead and draw our base and then I'll go ahead and draw off the planes of our

107
00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.130
pyramid.

108
00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.860
So and then let's decide where our light source is going to be coming from.

109
00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:50.420
So let's say our light source is right here and it's going to be hitting the surface right there.

110
00:07:50.570 --> 00:07:56.630
Well that means this is going to be our highlighted area and this is going to be our mid-tone area because

111
00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:01.790
it's on the side of our core shadow is going to be on this backside for pyramid.

112
00:08:01.790 --> 00:08:03.500
But since it's behind it we can't see it.

113
00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:04.870
We don't even have to worry about it.

114
00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.050
So let's go ahead and fill in our mid-tone.

115
00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:15.500
So then let's go ahead and add in our cast shadows cash those going to be on the opposite side of her

116
00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:16.110
light source.

117
00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:20.260
So this side over here and we can go ahead and fill that in.

118
00:08:28.230 --> 00:08:29.190
Perfect.

119
00:08:29.210 --> 00:08:34.510
Know we also forgot to add cast shadows onto these cones so let's go ahead and add those and also soak

120
00:08:34.530 --> 00:08:36.290
the light sources is coming from this side.

121
00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.970
We need to go ahead and add in or cash out of coming off in this direction and we're kind of running

122
00:08:41.970 --> 00:08:44.080
out of room there but that's all right.

123
00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:47.220
So there's the cash for that cone with this cone.

124
00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:57.010
It's going to be coming off like so and then we can go ahead and fill that cash out of one because this

125
00:08:57.010 --> 00:09:00.610
is the opposite side of the light source which is behind the cone.

126
00:09:04.630 --> 00:09:09.450
Remember that your cash out of this should get lighter the further away they get from the object.

127
00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:12.590
Right.

128
00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:14.050
Perfect.

129
00:09:14.050 --> 00:09:14.530
Next.

130
00:09:14.530 --> 00:09:21.130
Let's go over how to create a cast a shadow on a shake because sometimes the sheep that you're creating

131
00:09:21.130 --> 00:09:23.540
is going to create cash out on itself.

132
00:09:23.710 --> 00:09:27.380
So let's say for example we have a shape like so.

133
00:09:27.430 --> 00:09:33.460
So it's going to be sort of the fat T-shaped and then let's say that we have an edge coming over like

134
00:09:33.490 --> 00:09:35.500
this.

135
00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:40.690
Then we have a top surface and then we have this bottom area right here.

136
00:09:40.830 --> 00:09:43.220
So now we've created this ledge right here.

137
00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:49.050
Now this edge is going to be casting a shadow onto the shape so let's decide where our light source

138
00:09:49.050 --> 00:09:50.270
is going to be coming from.

139
00:09:50.460 --> 00:09:54.390
Let's say our light source is coming from this side right here and it's going to be hitting the surface

140
00:09:54.450 --> 00:09:55.350
the most.

141
00:09:55.440 --> 00:10:01.170
So this surface is going to be our highlight as well as the surface yet the surface is still also going

142
00:10:01.170 --> 00:10:05.850
to be getting a cast shadow on it because the light is coming from up here.

143
00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:10.240
Anything that this light can't reach underneath this ledge is going to get a shadow.

144
00:10:10.380 --> 00:10:12.510
So let's start by adding that cast shadow.

145
00:10:12.690 --> 00:10:19.380
Someone to draw a line right across like so and that line is indicating where that light can't hit this

146
00:10:19.380 --> 00:10:20.490
form anymore.

147
00:10:20.610 --> 00:10:32.180
So I'm to go ahead and now fill that in with my cast shadow.

148
00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:33.440
Perfect.

149
00:10:33.580 --> 00:10:39.500
And then I'm going to go ahead and fill was top area with my mid-tone color.

150
00:10:41.150 --> 00:10:42.740
Like so.

151
00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:48.650
And this area is also going to get Image Home color because the core shadow is going to be on the other

152
00:10:48.650 --> 00:10:52.070
side of her object so we're not going to see that foreshadow.

153
00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:56.090
So we're going to go ahead and add a second mid-tone color right here.

154
00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:06.830
But now you can see that an object can have a cast shadow on itself so it doesn't always just have to

155
00:11:06.830 --> 00:11:11.140
be on the surface sitting on a cat shadow can be cast on anything.

156
00:11:12.610 --> 00:11:18.650
Now let's have a look at one more form which we talked about in our last lecture which was this.

157
00:11:18.690 --> 00:11:25.030
You know we talked about how you can't have a sphere form without adding highlights or values or chateaus

158
00:11:25.030 --> 00:11:25.650
to it.

159
00:11:25.690 --> 00:11:28.060
So we need to go ahead and learn how to do that.

160
00:11:28.060 --> 00:11:30.380
So first off let's draw the circle.

161
00:11:30.550 --> 00:11:34.720
Now a really easy way to draw a circle because a lot of people have a hard time with it is first start

162
00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:39.130
making circular motions until you start seeing that circle you want to quickly start making the circular

163
00:11:39.130 --> 00:11:42.100
motions and you want to start making those from your shoulder.

164
00:11:42.100 --> 00:11:44.650
So not from your wrist or from your fingers.

165
00:11:44.650 --> 00:11:48.400
You want to make it from shoulder and that's going to make a lot easier to get those nice round the

166
00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:53.470
edges and then you're just going to slowly put the pencil down like so then you going to draw around

167
00:11:53.470 --> 00:11:59.770
a few times until you get that circle there and then you can go ahead and trace that out with a darker

168
00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:00.990
push.

169
00:12:01.210 --> 00:12:05.530
So and now let's go ahead and add some highlights and shadows to that.

170
00:12:05.530 --> 00:12:08.610
So what's First off inside where lights are still going to be coming from.

171
00:12:08.650 --> 00:12:11.580
And we're going to have a coming from over here on this side.

172
00:12:12.510 --> 00:12:17.640
And so the first thing we want to do is we want to start adding in that shadow on the opposite side

173
00:12:17.640 --> 00:12:18.270
of that.

174
00:12:18.300 --> 00:12:22.350
And since this is a round form we're going to make this shadow also around it.

175
00:12:22.350 --> 00:12:24.480
So it's going to be round is something like So.

176
00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:29.850
So then we want to go ahead and fill in this area with a darker shadow and this color can be sort of

177
00:12:29.850 --> 00:12:32.270
a minute tone color.

178
00:12:33.210 --> 00:12:38.640
And then we want to go ahead and blend that in to our highlight a little bit more just by pressing lightly.

179
00:12:38.700 --> 00:12:39.180
So

180
00:12:43.670 --> 00:12:46.370
next let's go ahead and add in our core shadow.

181
00:12:46.370 --> 00:12:49.960
And if you remember just like on our own sense this is a rounded object.

182
00:12:50.150 --> 00:12:53.660
All overtones blend into each other very seamlessly.

183
00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:59.210
So our next core color is going to go or our core value is going to go right here.

184
00:13:02.700 --> 00:13:06.860
Now what I'm going to do is over here on this side I'm going to leave this lighter.

185
00:13:06.870 --> 00:13:09.930
And the reason for that is because there is a thing called Bounce light.

186
00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:12.180
Now we're not going to get too much into that right now.

187
00:13:12.180 --> 00:13:17.130
We'll talk about it later but for now just understand that when an object is sitting on a surface or

188
00:13:17.130 --> 00:13:22.530
has a surface next to it it usually is going to bounce the light off of that especially if it's bright

189
00:13:22.830 --> 00:13:24.930
and it's going to bounce back onto your object.

190
00:13:24.930 --> 00:13:28.070
And so that's why this bottom area is going to be left a little bit lighter.

191
00:13:28.110 --> 00:13:33.060
It's going to be a little bit darker than my mid tone color but it's still going to be lighter than

192
00:13:33.150 --> 00:13:35.070
my core shadow.

193
00:13:35.090 --> 00:13:57.660
So go ahead and finish filling in that core chateau and then we can round this off a little bit more.

194
00:13:58.040 --> 00:13:58.400
All right.

195
00:13:58.400 --> 00:13:58.840
Great.

196
00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:04.270
So now we have all overshadowed except for our cast shadow So let's go ahead and add that in.

197
00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:07.270
So let's say that we have it coming off this NG.

198
00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:09.460
Since the light is coming from that side.

199
00:14:09.470 --> 00:14:11.970
So there is our cash shuttle right there.

200
00:14:11.990 --> 00:14:14.120
We can go ahead and fill that in now.

201
00:14:16.470 --> 00:14:19.510
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

202
00:14:19.530 --> 00:14:25.680
So in this lecture you learn how to add value and highlights and shadows to your 3-D forms.

203
00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:33.180
Now your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and draw all these basic shapes that I just created.

204
00:14:33.210 --> 00:14:40.590
So I want you to go ahead and draw the cube in the cone the pyramid and a random sheet object.

205
00:14:40.740 --> 00:14:45.930
And I also want you to do the sphere and I want you to do these from different angles.

206
00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:49.060
And I also want you to do them with different light sources.

207
00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:52.630
A really good way to help me do this is to draw from life.

208
00:14:52.830 --> 00:14:58.320
So what I want you to do is find an object from life say a book a ball anything.

209
00:14:58.350 --> 00:15:04.300
And I want you to draw these objects from life and study how the highlights and shadows apply to them.

210
00:15:04.350 --> 00:15:08.420
And also if you're in a room with a lot of white it's not really going to work.

211
00:15:08.430 --> 00:15:11.640
So you need to make sure that you put your object next to a lamp.

212
00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.020
That way you get one source of light just like we did with these objects.

213
00:15:16.110 --> 00:15:21.780
If you go ahead and draw these objects over and over again from life I guarantee you your understanding

214
00:15:21.810 --> 00:15:26.670
of highlights shadows and values are going to go up immensely.

215
00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.630
Thanks for watching this lecture and I look forward to seeing you in the next one.
