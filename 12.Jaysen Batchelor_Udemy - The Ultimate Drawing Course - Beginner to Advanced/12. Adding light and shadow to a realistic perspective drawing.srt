1
00:00:00,870 --> 00:00:01,350
All right.

2
00:00:01,410 --> 00:00:06,150
Welcome to the Part 2 lecture of creating our perspective drawing.

3
00:00:06,170 --> 00:00:08,550
Now let's go ahead and get started.

4
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:14,760
So the first thing I'm going to do in the second part is I'm going to create a light source soon to

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:16,520
go ahead and put a dot appear.

6
00:00:16,870 --> 00:00:19,030
And that's going to be where my light is coming from.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:24,370
So now I know where I want to put my chateaus So this side of my building is going to have my core shadow

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,510
and the other side of my building is going to have the mid-tone shadows.

9
00:00:28,510 --> 00:00:30,270
I'm just going to fill that in now.

10
00:00:38,870 --> 00:00:42,340
It's important to try to keep your shading as even as possible.

11
00:00:42,380 --> 00:00:44,480
And I know it's really hard to keep it even.

12
00:00:44,570 --> 00:00:47,660
And a lot of times you're not going to be able to make it perfect and that's fine.

13
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:50,270
Just try to keep it as even as possible.

14
00:00:50,270 --> 00:00:54,990
Sometimes this might mean that you have to go over it with multiple layers.

15
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:14,650
It's always important to start with your biggest things first.

16
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:17,260
When you start drawing anything or shading things in.

17
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,470
So always start with your biggest shapes your biggest surfaces that you have to shade in and then move

18
00:01:22,470 --> 00:01:24,860
down to smaller Do tell.

19
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:32,090
So now we're adding in our mid-tone chateau and noticed that I'm avoiding everything on that side except

20
00:01:32,090 --> 00:01:36,920
for that one surface so that if I need to I can come back in and add different values to those.

21
00:01:36,970 --> 00:01:41,840
I'm going to go ahead and add my core shadow which will then fade into my mid-tone shadow on that rounded

22
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:42,520
cylinder

23
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:53,810
and I'm going to go ahead and add in my shadow on this edge since it's on that side of my perspective.

24
00:01:55,470 --> 00:01:57,990
Go ahead and Durkan in that window just a little bit.

25
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,560
And now we can go ahead and add my shadow to this side of my wall.

26
00:02:01,590 --> 00:02:08,980
Since it's also on the side that has my core shadow on it then I'll no shade in this top area.

27
00:02:09,180 --> 00:02:12,480
And you notice the top area is a little bit lighter than my sidewall.

28
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,490
The reason for that is because it's getting bounce light and we'll go over what downslide is later.

29
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,860
For now all I need to understand is that that's bounce light and that's why it's brighter.

30
00:02:22,220 --> 00:02:29,100
Now I'm going ahead and adding in my mid-tone shadow onto this side of my wall and then go ahead and

31
00:02:29,100 --> 00:02:34,200
shade in that top area since it's going to be a little bit darker because it's curving in to the other

32
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,660
side of my wall.

33
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:38,080
Then I'm going to go ahead and Durcan this bottom area.

34
00:02:38,100 --> 00:02:39,480
This isn't any type of shadow.

35
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:43,150
This is just the actual value of that part of my building.

36
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:56,370
Now I to go ahead and darken in that window and just make sure that everything is in nice and even then

37
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,800
go ahead and Durkan in my roof because that's also the value of my roof.

38
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:10,750
I go ahead and you racists and appreciated because I want to keep the top area a little bit light.

39
00:03:11,080 --> 00:03:13,440
And then I'm just going to add a little bit of detail in there.

40
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,590
The shading in this box over here.

41
00:03:17,590 --> 00:03:21,900
So the side gets the mid-tone and then same with this other box.

42
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:26,510
And then the other side gets the darker core chÃ¢teaux.

43
00:03:26,770 --> 00:03:29,400
When I go ahead and grab another pencil and fill that an even better

44
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:46,290
I'm going to add a little bit of a cast shadow coming from underneath this white part of my box.

45
00:03:46,650 --> 00:03:49,560
And here in a second we're going to go ahead and extend that out.

46
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:52,190
But for now we're just going to add in that shadow.

47
00:03:52,410 --> 00:03:57,270
And so you'll see it here are racing out these edges of that white part of my box so I can push that

48
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,500
out just a little bit further.

49
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:00,200
So it looks more like a ledge.

50
00:04:02,320 --> 00:04:05,400
Now I'm going to add that same drop shadow on the other side too.

51
00:04:11,590 --> 00:04:16,430
Administer add in some shadow into my plants now so this side of my plants is going to get a lot more

52
00:04:16,430 --> 00:04:20,740
chÃ¢teaux than my other side because the other side is going to be getting hit by the light.

53
00:04:21,020 --> 00:04:24,600
So I'm only adding shadow to the left side of my plant.

54
00:04:28,930 --> 00:04:30,120
I'm mean the dirt and the whole.

55
00:04:30,170 --> 00:04:36,980
I want the values of my life used to be darker when I go back in there and add some darker detail just

56
00:04:36,980 --> 00:04:40,850
so it stands out more elsewhen adds some shadow underneath the plant.

57
00:04:40,850 --> 00:04:44,530
And then when I redraw that contrie line so it stands out even more.

58
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,330
Then I'm going to go ahead and Durkan these lines just so they stand out more also.

59
00:04:56,480 --> 00:04:58,180
And now we can start working on our tree.

60
00:04:58,470 --> 00:05:02,070
So I'm just darkening in that trunk.

61
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:06,090
And then I'm going go ahead and add some shadow to the bulk of my leaves.

62
00:05:09,300 --> 00:05:13,410
And just like any type of drawing it's always important to work the whole image at the same time so

63
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:14,910
you don't want to overwork one area.

64
00:05:14,910 --> 00:05:17,770
You want to work it for a while and then move on to another part.

65
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:23,250
So you'll see me switch back and forth between different parts of the drawing throughout the day drawing

66
00:05:24,100 --> 00:05:24,730
great here.

67
00:05:24,740 --> 00:05:27,890
I switched back over to my boxes.

68
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,700
Now I want to start putting in a little bit of a lighter value on my floor because I don't want it to

69
00:05:32,700 --> 00:05:38,100
be completely white and now Minister adding some detail onto my door so I'm just freehand in the perspective

70
00:05:38,130 --> 00:05:43,650
and trying to follow about where that perspective line would be for each one of these little squares

71
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:44,430
on the door.

72
00:05:44,700 --> 00:05:46,740
And then add some shadow edges to that

73
00:05:55,530 --> 00:05:58,070
and I just want to darken that door just a little bit more.

74
00:06:00,990 --> 00:06:04,660
So important to go over everything again if things start to become less defined.

75
00:06:04,660 --> 00:06:06,640
You want to go back and define them.

76
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,870
Then I'm just going to add a little bit of detail around this window so it's not just a circle window

77
00:06:10,900 --> 00:06:13,810
but it has maybe some pain around the circle.

78
00:06:14,020 --> 00:06:18,370
I'm going to do the same thing for the roof line just out of line across that roof line just to get

79
00:06:18,370 --> 00:06:20,590
a look make it look a little bit more interesting.

80
00:06:26,860 --> 00:06:32,830
Now I'm going to go ahead and start adding in my cast shadows so I'm drawing a very light line from

81
00:06:32,860 --> 00:06:37,320
each top corner of my drawing of my house.

82
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:41,680
And I'm trying to stay away from drawing it through the house.

83
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,840
I just want to draw at the other end where I need to see those lines.

84
00:06:45,340 --> 00:06:49,960
And then I'm going to go ahead and find where that light source is on my horizon line and then draw

85
00:06:49,960 --> 00:06:54,290
my crossing lines which connect with each corner of my building.

86
00:06:54,390 --> 00:06:59,090
And so I'm trying to figure out where that peak is going to be.

87
00:06:59,260 --> 00:07:04,830
So I draw a line through that bottom corner and then I need to go ahead and draw a line through my other

88
00:07:04,830 --> 00:07:05,490
corner.

89
00:07:08,870 --> 00:07:10,670
So there's my other point.

90
00:07:11,720 --> 00:07:15,360
And then I need to go ahead and draw my third point.

91
00:07:15,650 --> 00:07:20,660
And my third point I'm actually just going to have to guess where it is because it's the point for the

92
00:07:20,660 --> 00:07:21,400
peak of my roof.

93
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,390
And so I'm just about guessing where that is but I'm also deciding that it's just going to fade out

94
00:07:26,390 --> 00:07:28,400
by the time we get to that point where you see that peak.

95
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,430
And so I'm not even going to worry about it.

96
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:46,500
I'm just going to go ahead and start adding in my cast shadow.

97
00:07:47,040 --> 00:07:50,880
And like I said that cash out it was going to slowly fade out as it gets to the other side.

98
00:07:51,030 --> 00:07:54,270
And since this box is in the way the cash flow is actually going to be cast over it.

99
00:07:54,270 --> 00:07:57,510
And so that's why the cash is coming up like it is onto the box

100
00:08:00,520 --> 00:08:01,950
I'll continue to fill that in

101
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:11,670
then I need to go ahead and create the cash for this box here.

102
00:08:11,970 --> 00:08:16,110
And I don't need to create it from any other box because it's covered by the shadow of the building

103
00:08:16,140 --> 00:08:16,860
already.

104
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:21,800
So I only have to worry about this box at sticking it out over the edge of that cast shadow.

105
00:08:21,870 --> 00:08:25,920
So then I'll figure out where each one of those points are and I might go ahead and fill that in with

106
00:08:25,920 --> 00:08:29,800
the same cast shadow and it'll slowly blend into my other cat shadow

107
00:08:38,690 --> 00:08:40,690
and sense that boxes in the show too.

108
00:08:40,690 --> 00:08:43,710
I went ahead and darken the whole wide area of it.

109
00:08:46,470 --> 00:08:50,510
To start erasing some of these lines these guidelines that I no longer need.

110
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,620
And then I'm just going to go ahead and start adding a little bit of detail on to my ground.

111
00:09:03,650 --> 00:09:07,280
So we added in a few extra perspective lines on the ground.

112
00:09:07,280 --> 00:09:11,720
So that way we can them we can see where that perspective is.

113
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:16,520
And so now we can go ahead and lightly sketch in sort of some bricks or rocks on the ground and they'll

114
00:09:16,520 --> 00:09:17,750
be in the correct perspective.

115
00:09:17,750 --> 00:09:22,970
So as long as we're about following those lines that are criss crossing we should be good and it will

116
00:09:22,970 --> 00:09:27,230
help create more of a ground plane for drawing.

117
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,940
Next I'm going go ahead and add a little bit of detail in the background so some small little houses.

118
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,440
And just like we learned before in the course everything in the background is going to be a lot smaller

119
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:48,570
because it's far away.

120
00:09:48,730 --> 00:09:51,640
So we're creating space and we're also making it really light.

121
00:09:51,640 --> 00:09:54,340
So we're using the value technique to create that space.

122
00:09:54,490 --> 00:09:57,360
And we're also only adding very minimal detail.

123
00:09:57,520 --> 00:10:01,840
So you kind of get the idea that there are some houses with some chimneys and doors but we don't really

124
00:10:01,840 --> 00:10:08,580
go into great detail because we're trying to create that illusion of space.

125
00:10:08,610 --> 00:10:10,380
I mean go ahead and do the same thing on the other side.

126
00:10:10,380 --> 00:10:16,500
So just very simple shape kind of like a house and then go ahead and add in some clouds in there.

127
00:10:19,570 --> 00:10:23,870
And I'm using the side of my pencil to create this effect where I can create a nice shadow and then

128
00:10:25,290 --> 00:10:30,120
create the edge of my cloud and then go ahead and Durkan in my sky just a little bit.

129
00:10:32,350 --> 00:10:36,470
And it's going to make a gradient into my white I'll do the same thing on the other side.

130
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:46,040
So that will slowly turn into a white.

131
00:10:46,120 --> 00:10:46,630
All right.

132
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:53,810
And now I went ahead and I cut off all the areas that were outside of my 60 percent square.

133
00:10:53,830 --> 00:10:58,990
And I also cut off a little bit of the bottom to create more of a composition for my drawing.

134
00:10:59,260 --> 00:11:02,020
And so now that brings us to the end of this drawing.

135
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:08,590
So in this drawing you were able to see how I created an entire building and the landscape around it

136
00:11:08,950 --> 00:11:15,370
just by using the things we've learned up to this point which is values lights and shadows contrast

137
00:11:15,370 --> 00:11:19,730
perspective and using shapes to create a finished drawing.

138
00:11:19,750 --> 00:11:23,690
I really hope that you learn something from this lecture by watching me draw this picture.

139
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:26,500
And I look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.

140
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:27,480
Thanks for watching.
