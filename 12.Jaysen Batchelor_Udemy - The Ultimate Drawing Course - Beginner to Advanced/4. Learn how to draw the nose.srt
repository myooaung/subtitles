1
00:00:00,650 --> 00:00:05,180
In this lecture we're going to be going over how to draw the human nose.

2
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:07,550
So let's go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,360
So the first thing I'd like to say is that when I'm drawing the human nose I like to think of it in

4
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,190
two different ways.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:18,830
The first one is I'd like to think of it as a boomerang type shape.

6
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:25,140
So if you come right over here to the corner of my page and go ahead and draw the shape of my nose.

7
00:00:25,290 --> 00:00:27,240
And this isn't the shape of the Internode.

8
00:00:27,270 --> 00:00:31,820
This is the shape of the bottom of the nose and the shadow underneath it.

9
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:37,350
So if I draw a shape like that now I can go ahead and draw my nostrils and so my nostrils are basically

10
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:45,280
just going to be sort of raindrop type shapes and then I can go ahead and fill those in with a darker

11
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:46,130
value.

12
00:00:46,420 --> 00:00:51,830
And then from there we can go ahead and fill the sheep in with a mid-tone of value.

13
00:00:52,090 --> 00:00:57,340
So and then we have the sheep and the shadow of the bottom of the nose.

14
00:00:57,340 --> 00:01:00,980
Now if you're not seen it yet let's go ahead and add some further detail.

15
00:01:00,980 --> 00:01:07,610
So I'm going to go ahead and have an open like so and I'm like so and two lines underneath here and

16
00:01:07,610 --> 00:01:10,460
now that makes up the bottom middle part of my nose.

17
00:01:10,620 --> 00:01:15,870
And then I go ahead and also add in a line on this edge like so that then also comes up into my white

18
00:01:15,930 --> 00:01:17,520
area.

19
00:01:18,870 --> 00:01:24,060
And now I have a very basic nose I could go ahead and take that a little bit further by adding a little

20
00:01:24,060 --> 00:01:28,370
bit more shading and sheep to my nose.

21
00:01:30,300 --> 00:01:34,360
But that's the first way I like to think about the nose.

22
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,220
The next way I like to think about my nose is as three circles.

23
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:40,560
So let's go ahead and draw three circles.

24
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:48,000
So first off we have a large circle which is the center of her nose and we have our two circles on the

25
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:50,300
ends which make up these nostrils.

26
00:01:50,310 --> 00:01:55,610
So go ahead and draw one right here and I'm going draw another one right there.

27
00:01:56,070 --> 00:01:58,830
Now from here I can go ahead and draw my nose.

28
00:01:58,860 --> 00:02:06,700
So if I want I can start off by creating that boomerang type sheep and then feeling that in

29
00:02:10,170 --> 00:02:12,750
then I can go ahead and add in my nostrils

30
00:02:16,310 --> 00:02:22,790
and then I can go ahead and add in some more shading more of a ledge to my nostrils and I can race away

31
00:02:22,820 --> 00:02:27,780
anything up here that I was using as a guide but I no longer want to see.

32
00:02:28,310 --> 00:02:32,480
So that's also a very basic way to draw nerves.

33
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:36,980
Now at the point of drawing with these three circles is this is how you can create the size of your

34
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:41,720
nose so if I wanted my nose to be bigger I could go ahead and draw my circle larger.

35
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,410
And then I can draw my two smaller circles larger two and I can change the placement of them to change

36
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:54,620
the shape of my nose so if I bring my circles more down towards the bottom like so now I have a different

37
00:02:54,620 --> 00:02:58,120
shaped nose so I can go ahead and draw in my nostrils.

38
00:02:58,120 --> 00:02:59,570
First off.

39
00:02:59,960 --> 00:03:05,980
And then I can go ahead and draw in the bottom part of my nose and those can lead into my nostrils holes

40
00:03:08,980 --> 00:03:12,570
then they can go ahead and draw in my boomerang shape.

41
00:03:16,090 --> 00:03:25,050
And I can feel that in my head and some more shading and detailing and also a race the way these guidelines

42
00:03:35,460 --> 00:03:38,590
but that's how you can treat different sized noses.

43
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:45,150
So I'd really encourage you to think about noses in these two simple shape ways by thinking of the bottom

44
00:03:45,150 --> 00:03:50,130
of the nose as a shadow of that shape like a boomerang and then it's thinking of the main shape of the

45
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:56,070
nose as a large circle and then the two nostrils as two smaller circles that you can then go ahead and

46
00:03:56,070 --> 00:04:01,650
further detail and add in your nostril holes the edge of your nostrils and in the main middle part of

47
00:04:01,650 --> 00:04:02,830
the nostril.

48
00:04:02,910 --> 00:04:07,090
Now let's go ahead and learn how to draw the nostrils from the front view.

49
00:04:07,110 --> 00:04:11,270
So the knot goes all the way up to the brow of the face.

50
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,100
So first off what we're going to do is we're going to go ahead and start to sketch out our nose.

51
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:23,940
So we're going to start off with the nostrils them start off with the second nostril and the other side.

52
00:04:25,780 --> 00:04:29,440
And then what we have is we have the middle part of our nose.

53
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:36,040
So first off we have this bottom area like we drew before over here and then we have the underside of

54
00:04:36,040 --> 00:04:37,180
the nostril.

55
00:04:37,180 --> 00:04:41,890
Now it's really important that when you're drawing the human face that you use the reference while you're

56
00:04:41,890 --> 00:04:42,490
drawn

57
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:48,720
so there is the basic shape of the human nose.

58
00:04:48,810 --> 00:04:53,310
Next what we need to do is we need to start adding in some valleys and shadows.

59
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:59,060
So starting with up here we need to add some padding values and shadows to shape the bridge of the nose.

60
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:05,010
So I'm going to go ahead and start adding some darker shadows down this edge and they start from the

61
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,800
corner of the eye and come all the way down to the bottom of the nose which then start to morph into

62
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,300
the shape of this middle part of the nose.

63
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:18,490
Now we can start shaping that by adding values underneath the nose and on the side of the nose.

64
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,980
And we'll continue to layer in that shading

65
00:05:34,250 --> 00:05:40,730
then we can go ahead and start to Durkan in our nostril holes in the Nasra holes aren't always completely

66
00:05:40,730 --> 00:05:41,720
black.

67
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,110
They usually start off really dark towards the top.

68
00:05:44,110 --> 00:05:48,660
And as you get to the bottom of the nostril hole they start to lighten up a little bit.

69
00:05:48,680 --> 00:05:49,080
So

70
00:05:52,990 --> 00:06:04,220
next let's go ahead and add the shading on it this side of the nose on the underside.

71
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:09,780
And also there tends to be a little bit of a highlight on this ledge of the nostril holes will leave

72
00:06:10,030 --> 00:06:14,290
a little bit of white right there to make it look more realistic.

73
00:06:14,910 --> 00:06:19,110
This is why it's very important to use references because you'll see and pick up little things like

74
00:06:19,110 --> 00:06:20,260
that.

75
00:06:20,410 --> 00:06:25,980
Now let's go ahead and add some more shading underneath the larger part of the nose and we can have

76
00:06:25,980 --> 00:06:28,320
some more shading under this part of the nose too.

77
00:06:28,590 --> 00:06:33,780
And this is going to be our cast shadow because the light source is coming from the top.

78
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:37,710
That means it's going to be casting a shadow underneath the nose.

79
00:06:37,710 --> 00:06:43,200
Now this doesn't have to be a very hard edged shadow we can go ahead and keep it pretty soft on the

80
00:06:43,200 --> 00:06:43,980
edges.

81
00:06:50,250 --> 00:06:52,770
And we'll continue to darken everything in.

82
00:06:52,790 --> 00:06:57,810
So Mansome more shadow on this underside seam of this side.

83
00:07:06,500 --> 00:07:12,580
Let me add a little bit of some light sheeting right crossed here.

84
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:23,960
Go ahead and add some more shading to these edges and also to this edge or an Austro.

85
00:07:24,270 --> 00:07:27,930
And I think the bottom of her nose needs to be a little bit dark or something to go in there and add

86
00:07:27,930 --> 00:07:34,780
some more shading like so then I need to go in there and read Durkan all of my previous shading.

87
00:07:35,070 --> 00:07:38,940
So it still has that form and dimension.

88
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:16,270
Or grumped So there's a nose from the front view we can Durkan up here a little bit more if we like.

89
00:08:16,390 --> 00:08:19,790
I'm just noticing in my reference that it's a little bit darker up there.

90
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:23,920
All right.

91
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:24,960
Great.

92
00:08:24,980 --> 00:08:28,660
So now let's move on to drawing the news from a side view.

93
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:35,030
So it's important to know how to draw different parts of the face from every possible view because depending

94
00:08:35,030 --> 00:08:39,320
on what type of drawn you're doing it you may find that you need to draw a nose from a different view.

95
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:42,720
So let's go ahead and draw one from the side view.

96
00:08:42,740 --> 00:08:46,750
So first off we need to think of it as sort of a number seven.

97
00:08:46,790 --> 00:08:54,680
Like we went over before a lot of people accidentally draw noses as 7s which is relatively close.

98
00:08:54,680 --> 00:09:00,350
The thing is that the nose is actually broken up into much more of a shape than just a number seven.

99
00:09:00,350 --> 00:09:06,380
So we want to draw an upside down Number Seven like so necessarily can do is we can go ahead and slice

100
00:09:06,380 --> 00:09:10,990
off this corner right here and that's going to be this bottom plane of the nose.

101
00:09:11,150 --> 00:09:12,860
So we slice that off.

102
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:18,140
Next we need to bring this line down just a little bit more of at an angle rather than being a straight

103
00:09:18,140 --> 00:09:24,290
horizontal line and needs to be more angled and then that will curve into the upper part of the lip.

104
00:09:24,430 --> 00:09:29,530
Then we need to go ahead and find out where the edge of her nostrils is going to be and our nostril

105
00:09:29,530 --> 00:09:30,080
hole.

106
00:09:30,100 --> 00:09:32,180
So you can start with whichever one you like.

107
00:09:32,290 --> 00:09:35,240
I usually start with the not for Hole itself.

108
00:09:35,390 --> 00:09:40,630
The noster hole tends to kind of go up just a little bit and then come back down and depending on whose

109
00:09:40,630 --> 00:09:44,040
nose it is this hole could be longer or it could be shorter.

110
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:46,110
In this case it's going to be a little bit longer.

111
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:52,360
It's going to be a man's nostril hole and then we're going to go ahead and add the edge of our nose

112
00:09:52,660 --> 00:09:53,620
or a nostril.

113
00:09:53,620 --> 00:09:57,050
So it's going to start pretty close to that edge of the hole.

114
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:59,390
And as it gets out of here it's going to become wider.

115
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:06,670
Between that space and that's basically the side view of the nose depending on whose nose it says you

116
00:10:06,670 --> 00:10:13,060
might have in this line or here either curve downwards or you might have it curved up like so or you

117
00:10:13,060 --> 00:10:15,220
might have it a little bit weak.

118
00:10:15,220 --> 00:10:17,150
So in this case we're going to make a little wavy.

119
00:10:17,170 --> 00:10:19,450
So first it's going to come in like so.

120
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,260
So this becomes sort of one of its own shape right there.

121
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:31,270
And then it's going to come back out a little bit and then it's going to wave back in like so then we're

122
00:10:31,270 --> 00:10:34,500
going to go ahead and add in the sheeting on the bottom part of the nose.

123
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:39,970
So in this case we just want to basically draw a line underneath this bottom area and we can go ahead

124
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:42,450
and shoot that in with a mid-tone value.

125
00:10:42,460 --> 00:10:47,500
We can also add a little bit of that cache underneath and then we can go ahead and start darkening in

126
00:10:47,500 --> 00:10:50,330
the shadow underneath our nostril.

127
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,600
Gripped next what we want to do is we want to go ahead and start adding some more shading in along this

128
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:19,060
edge right here so that we start to get the form of this part of the nose and then we can also add some

129
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,020
shading on this back edge.

130
00:11:22,100 --> 00:11:27,740
And again I'm looking at reference so I have a good idea of where I want my lights and shadows to be

131
00:11:30,960 --> 00:11:36,660
I'm going to add a little bit more of a shadow along this under edge and above my nostril hole.

132
00:11:43,740 --> 00:11:47,970
And then I'm a go ahead and curve this line out a little bit more and soften it.

133
00:11:48,390 --> 00:11:51,450
Sometimes you don't like your lines to be too hard.

134
00:11:58,960 --> 00:12:01,210
Go ahead and it's more shooting underneath here.

135
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:06,600
Then I might add a little bit of sheeting along this edge

136
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:20,540
on groups.

137
00:12:20,550 --> 00:12:23,650
So now we have the side view of the nuns.

138
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:29,040
Now the last thing I want to show you how to draw is a one to show you how to draw a nose from a sort

139
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,360
of 45 degree angle.

140
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:32,820
So let's go ahead and do that.

141
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,230
So the first thing we need to do is we need to understand that you're going to see more of one side

142
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:38,870
of the nose than the other.

143
00:12:39,150 --> 00:12:45,150
So basically we're going to break it up into first off our basic three circle so there's the first one

144
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:48,490
there's the next one and then there's the other one.

145
00:12:48,510 --> 00:12:54,150
But you'll see that this one is a little bit more behind this Surt larger circle than this one.

146
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,720
That's because we're looking at it more from this angle.

147
00:12:56,940 --> 00:12:59,370
So now we can go ahead and start adding in our detail.

148
00:12:59,370 --> 00:13:02,840
So first off we're going to start with the main sheet of the nose.

149
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,570
But since we're looking at it from the side we're going to get a mix between these two views so we're

150
00:13:06,570 --> 00:13:09,260
going to see a little bit of this angle and a little bit of that.

151
00:13:09,260 --> 00:13:12,940
And so we to go ahead and add that in.

152
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:20,280
So we get sort of that kind of a shape and then that turns into the bottom of our nostril and then we

153
00:13:20,280 --> 00:13:25,450
can go ahead and add in our second nostril like so.

154
00:13:25,710 --> 00:13:32,990
And then this bottom shape is going to turn into our nostril hole and then this bottom shape right here

155
00:13:33,000 --> 00:13:37,300
doesn't actually turn into unalterable or an ulcer hole actually starts up here.

156
00:13:37,390 --> 00:13:41,450
You know we can go ahead and add that in and fill it in a little bit.

157
00:13:41,490 --> 00:13:42,500
Perfect.

158
00:13:42,780 --> 00:13:48,390
Next let's go ahead and finish out the shape of this nostril on this side and then let's go ahead and

159
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:52,890
add and a little bit of a guideline or here for that side of the nose.

160
00:13:52,900 --> 00:13:57,130
Now this looks kind of funny but once we start adding in our shading it will look much better.

161
00:13:57,450 --> 00:14:03,240
So what we want to do is we want to start off by adding the shading on the bottom side of the nose and

162
00:14:03,340 --> 00:14:09,070
some people's nose are split up into sort of two separate shapes so one on the side and one on the side.

163
00:14:09,080 --> 00:14:11,470
In this case our nose is going to be like that.

164
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:16,100
So our shadow starts to come up into that sheet a little bit and then we're going to go ahead and add

165
00:14:16,210 --> 00:14:22,310
the sheep on this other side where the shooting on that side we're going to go ahead and add some shading

166
00:14:22,370 --> 00:14:26,740
on the underside of the nose and on this side of the nostril.

167
00:14:26,950 --> 00:14:33,070
Go ahead and shoot all the way over and then we can add in a little bit of a cast a shadow on this side.

168
00:14:36,990 --> 00:14:37,600
Great.

169
00:14:37,630 --> 00:14:41,750
Next let's go ahead and add in a little bit more of the bridge of our nose up here.

170
00:14:41,770 --> 00:14:46,330
So we're just going to add a little bit of the line right there and then over here we're going to add

171
00:14:46,330 --> 00:14:54,560
a little bit of some dirt or shadowing you might bring that wine over a little bit more bring that shot

172
00:14:54,600 --> 00:15:02,860
I mean all the way down to here great then I'm going go ahead and erase away a little bit of that guideline

173
00:15:02,860 --> 00:15:06,290
that I had for the shape and that we can really start determining things.

174
00:15:06,350 --> 00:15:10,870
So starting with my Nasra whole I'm going to Durgan that in scene with the other side.

175
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:16,560
So then go ahead and d'Argent that in.

176
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:21,700
And then I want to go ahead and start adding some more sheeting in here and during some of the areas

177
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:29,030
and adding some lighter shading up here in this lighter area just so we can sort of create some more

178
00:15:29,070 --> 00:16:35,020
fair.

179
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:35,510
All right.

180
00:16:35,560 --> 00:16:35,980
Great.

181
00:16:35,980 --> 00:16:39,810
So now we have the nose from a 45 degree angle.

182
00:16:39,940 --> 00:16:42,040
That brings us to the end of this lecture.

183
00:16:42,040 --> 00:16:47,640
So in this lecture we learn how to draw the human nose first we learned to look at it as a boomerang

184
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:48,550
type shape.

185
00:16:48,550 --> 00:16:52,980
Now this boomerang type shape is the shape of the bottom of the shadow of the nose.

186
00:16:52,990 --> 00:16:58,660
I find that this is the simplest way to think of the nose into roughly sketched in the nest when we

187
00:16:58,660 --> 00:17:04,390
learned about to think of the nose is by drawing three circles a large circle for the middle and two

188
00:17:04,390 --> 00:17:07,270
smaller circles for the nostrils.

189
00:17:07,270 --> 00:17:13,270
Then we learned how to draw the nose from the front view the side view and a threequarters view.

190
00:17:13,270 --> 00:17:18,790
Now your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and draw at least one knows but I recommended that

191
00:17:18,790 --> 00:17:23,140
you draw at least five different noses from reference images.

192
00:17:23,140 --> 00:17:28,810
Then post one of those to the Q&amp;A section of the Course or the Facebook group.

193
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:33,040
Thanks for watching and I'm really look forward to seeing you in the next election.

194
00:17:33,210 --> 00:17:36,430
We're we're going to learn how to draw the human mouth.
