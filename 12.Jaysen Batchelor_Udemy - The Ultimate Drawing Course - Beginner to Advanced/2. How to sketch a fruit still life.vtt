00:00:00.670 --> 00:00:08.570
Art in this lecture we're going to be creating a still life drawing of this banana that's on this fabric.

2
00:00:08.570 --> 00:00:14.780
Now like I said doing still life studies are very important to becoming a good artist because you need

3
00:00:14.780 --> 00:00:19.810
to study real life and understand how light and shadow as well as shape works.

4
00:00:19.850 --> 00:00:24.250
And the best way to do that is to draw pictures that are from real life.

5
00:00:24.290 --> 00:00:26.720
So let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:31.520
The first thing I'm going to do is unwind to take a measurement of the height of my banana.

7
00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:36.410
So from the tallest point on my banana to the bottom of that point we're going to go ahead and measure

8
00:00:36.410 --> 00:00:39.030
that with our pencil and our thumb.

9
00:00:39.110 --> 00:00:43.210
Once we get that measurement we want to make sure that our arm is completely extended out.

10
00:00:43.220 --> 00:00:48.230
So when we come back and take our horizontal measurement we have the same proportions.

11
00:00:48.410 --> 00:00:55.290
So let's go ahead and take this measurement and apply it to our paper so we're going to go ahead and

12
00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:59.730
lay it down just like so and mark that point.

13
00:00:59.730 --> 00:01:04.400
Next I'm going to go ahead and measure the width of my banana.

14
00:01:04.410 --> 00:01:10.740
So using my pencil once again and fully extending my arm I'm going to go ahead and mark that with my

15
00:01:10.740 --> 00:01:14.520
thumb and then I can go ahead and apply that to my paper.

16
00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:20.850
So Mark that just like so and so now we have the basic shape and distance of where we can create our

17
00:01:20.850 --> 00:01:21.300
banana.

18
00:01:21.300 --> 00:01:23.920
I'm going to go ahead and draw a line down here at the bottom.

19
00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.240
That way I have more of a composition than I'm going to go ahead and start lightly sketching in the

20
00:01:31.240 --> 00:01:33.180
shape of my banana.

21
00:01:33.730 --> 00:01:39.160
So remember to always keep things light until you know exactly where you want them because otherwise

22
00:01:39.190 --> 00:01:40.680
it's going to be very difficult to come back.

23
00:01:40.690 --> 00:01:41.740
Any race things.

24
00:01:41.740 --> 00:01:45.250
So I'm just very lightly sketching in the basic shape of that banana.

25
00:01:45.250 --> 00:01:46.570
No detail yet.

26
00:01:46.570 --> 00:01:48.140
Just the basic shape.

27
00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:55.360
And these are just the contouring windes all work on the second banana.

28
00:01:55.690 --> 00:02:00.850
And again I'm looking back at my banana as much as possible and try not to look at my drawings so much

29
00:02:01.060 --> 00:02:04.410
but really studying that banana and where that sheep is going.

30
00:02:04.540 --> 00:02:10.120
So remember you want to be spending at least 50 percent of your time looking at your actual object rather

31
00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.240
than looking at your drawing.

32
00:02:11.350 --> 00:02:15.060
It's even better if you're looking at your object 60 percent of the time.

33
00:02:16.120 --> 00:02:18.160
Then go ahead and start sketching in there.

34
00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:20.490
Some of the detail on that fabric.

35
00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.050
So I'm trying to stay away from adding too much light and shadow.

36
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:28.720
I just want to add in some contouring lines as my guideline so I can come back in there and add in that

37
00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:30.550
highlight and shadow.

38
00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:35.970
So again it's really important to go back and really study your object to make sure you're copying it

39
00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:42.850
correctly and also look at things in proportions see how they relate to each other and how far apart

40
00:02:42.910 --> 00:02:44.420
each thing is.

41
00:02:56.380 --> 00:03:03.510
So continue to add in that detail for my fabric and I add very minimal type of shadowing in there.

42
00:03:03.520 --> 00:03:08.680
And I for the most part I just want to make sure that I have some guidelines that I can use to create

43
00:03:09.010 --> 00:03:10.930
my final drawing.

44
00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:44.500
Now I know very often when you're drawing pictures like this you're really going to want to start adding

45
00:03:44.510 --> 00:03:45.400
in some detail.

46
00:03:45.470 --> 00:03:46.140
But trust me.

47
00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:50.210
Wait until you have the whole drawing laid out and have your shapes correct.

48
00:03:50.210 --> 00:03:55.160
Once everything is correct shape wise then you're going to be allowed to go in there and add in all

49
00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:57.660
of your detail and shadows and highlights.

50
00:03:57.740 --> 00:04:17.570
You may be dissatisfied because it won't look realistic because your shapes are all off.

51
00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.420
Now I'm going to go ahead and start adding in some value.

52
00:04:20.460 --> 00:04:25.280
So I'm going to be using crosshatching to create my drawing.

53
00:04:25.450 --> 00:04:31.830
And so as you can see here I'm just adding lines to create those values which are shadows and I'm looking

54
00:04:31.830 --> 00:04:36.390
at my drawing as much as possible to figure out where those Darcus values are.

55
00:04:50.070 --> 00:04:53.080
And also don't be too quick to add in those shadows.

56
00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:56.670
Make sure that you're looking back at your reference or your object.

57
00:04:56.670 --> 00:04:59.770
That way you know exactly what you need to draw in there.

58
00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.700
So and if you're not sure don't add it in until you're completely sure or added in very lightly you

59
00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:07.840
can always come back and erase it.

60
00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.540
And you want to make everything exactly as you see it.

61
00:05:24.540 --> 00:05:29.410
So if you see a shadow line pay attention to whether it's hard or soft.

62
00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:35.250
Also pay attention if it's soft on one side meaning that it slowly blends into the value next to it

63
00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:42.060
or if it has a very hard line meaning that there's a very distinctive line between one value and another

64
00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.830
value.

65
00:05:48.270 --> 00:05:52.280
So right here I'm really blending that in so it's a nice soft edge.

66
00:05:52.410 --> 00:05:54.460
Same with right here it's a nice soft edge

67
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.430
and Mr adding in some detail on to my banana stem

68
00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:22.420
now to go ahead and start darkening this edge because I know by looking at my reference that's the dark

69
00:06:22.450 --> 00:06:28.660
area of my banana and a banana is split up into different sections or different quarter sort of.

70
00:06:28.660 --> 00:06:30.790
And so I want to make sure I include that in there.

71
00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:36.610
And so now I'm adding in that bottom shadow by adding some crosshatching then add some crosshatching

72
00:06:36.610 --> 00:06:42.060
like so to start creating that second piece of my banana or the second quarter of my banana.

73
00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.910
And then darken the edge so it stands out more because don't forget we want to incorporate contrast

74
00:06:47.910 --> 00:06:48.260
in here.

75
00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:55.830
So the more dark values next to light values we have the better it's going to look underneath this banana

76
00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:58.900
is going to be a lot of shadow on that fabric.

77
00:07:06.390 --> 00:07:09.770
Then I'm the go ahead answer and in some detail to this end of the banana.

78
00:07:09.980 --> 00:07:14.820
And again I'm always going back and looking at my bananas to make sure that I'm doing things correctly.

79
00:07:14.820 --> 00:07:18.320
So rather than trying to trod on my head like a lot of people do.

80
00:07:18.380 --> 00:07:21.640
I'm trying to look at my object and draw exactly what I see.

81
00:07:21.650 --> 00:07:27.140
And so in order to do that I always need to be looking back at my bananas or my reference to make sure

82
00:07:27.140 --> 00:07:29.700
that things are being drawn correctly.

83
00:07:41.250 --> 00:07:43.260
And I'm always adding things a little bit at a time.

84
00:07:43.260 --> 00:07:46.530
I never really jump in there and add the whole thing all at once.

85
00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:51.570
You'll see I always come back to areas and add in more detail more shading just so I make sure that

86
00:07:51.570 --> 00:07:52.670
I get it correctly.

87
00:07:52.830 --> 00:07:58.970
And just like all of our drawings up to this point we want to make sure that we work certain areas all

88
00:07:58.980 --> 00:07:59.750
at the same time.

89
00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:03.900
So rather than work in one area and then being done with it we want to work it for a while and then

90
00:08:03.900 --> 00:08:10.080
move on to another area so that we can work the entire picture and never overwork an area.

91
00:08:10.260 --> 00:08:15.330
This will help us create a good overall drawing and help us so that we make sure that everything's in

92
00:08:15.330 --> 00:08:17.720
proportion and has the correct values.

93
00:08:26.690 --> 00:08:32.010
Then I'm going in there and adding some of this detail to just sort of little brown spots on my bananas.

94
00:08:32.130 --> 00:08:36.880
But it's what's really going to make it look realistic is adding in every little detail that I see

95
00:08:41.270 --> 00:08:43.570
denim hiding in the shadow right here.

96
00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:49.600
So this is an example of it may not make sense that that shadow is on that top side of the banana but

97
00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.880
it's still there in real life.

98
00:08:50.890 --> 00:08:51.990
And so you need to draw it.

99
00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.980
This is why it's really important to draw from still lifes is because you're going to encounter things

100
00:08:56.980 --> 00:09:02.260
that you don't encounter when you're looking at things that involve math or guidelines or anything like

101
00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:07.390
that you're going to encounter things that only happen in real life and you're going to start to understand

102
00:09:07.420 --> 00:09:11.280
how real life lighting and stuff like that works a lot better.

103
00:09:16.050 --> 00:09:19.370
So now I'm adding some darker detail down here.

104
00:09:19.370 --> 00:09:24.710
And so you see as the drawing goes on I start to commit to a lot of the shadows a lot more by darkening

105
00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:29.180
them but only once I'm completely sure they're where they need to be.

106
00:09:29.190 --> 00:09:33.150
So now Mr. darkening and this cast shadow for my banana

107
00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.820
it's also very important to pay attention to the way that you light your still lives.

108
00:09:45.850 --> 00:09:52.060
So in this particular photograph of the bananas they're actually lit with one lamp.

109
00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:57.000
In some cases you might want to have a lamp on both sides to try different types of lighting.

110
00:09:57.040 --> 00:10:01.960
And I recommend that you try lighting things in different ways and then drawing them so you can understand

111
00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:05.170
how different forms of lighting affect your objects.

112
00:10:09.360 --> 00:10:13.800
Now I'm adding in a ledge right here with a little bit of shadow so that way my banana is broken up

113
00:10:13.800 --> 00:10:15.760
into different quarters.

114
00:10:18.590 --> 00:10:22.040
And really what I'm doing is I'm not trying to think about how the banana works.

115
00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:28.280
I'm just trying to think I'm just trying to copy exactly what I see the exact shape the exact values.

116
00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.950
I'm not trying to think how the banana is made I'm not trying to think how it works in perspective.

117
00:10:32.960 --> 00:10:57.110
I'm just trying to copy exactly what I see.

118
00:10:57.300 --> 00:11:01.220
Go ahead and add in some more of that brown speckling detail in their

119
00:11:06.310 --> 00:11:12.100
also noticed that I wait towards the end to start adding in all my little details so you want to start

120
00:11:12.100 --> 00:11:16.960
with the biggest parts of your drawings the things with the least detail which are going to be your

121
00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.490
shapes and your large areas of value.

122
00:11:20.710 --> 00:11:24.840
And then after you start working with that you can start whittling that down into more detail until

123
00:11:24.850 --> 00:11:29.440
you get towards the end where you're going to add in your very fine detail such as those little brown

124
00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.460
specks and little wrinkles in your fabric.

125
00:11:33.520 --> 00:11:36.910
Also make sure you lay out a piece of paper for your hand to rest on.

126
00:11:36.910 --> 00:11:43.480
That way it doesn't smudge your graphite while you're drawing.

127
00:11:43.510 --> 00:11:46.400
Now I want the focal point my drawing to be the bananas.

128
00:11:46.450 --> 00:11:48.210
So I'm creating the most contrast there.

129
00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:52.890
So that's where you'll see the lightest in the darkest values next to each other.

130
00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:59.290
So as I get out to these outer edges of my fabric I'm going to add less contrast in less detail also.

131
00:11:59.320 --> 00:12:06.010
And it's also going to get a lot lighter and not be so dark and that's why I create my focal point and

132
00:12:06.010 --> 00:12:10.230
remember the focal point is just where the viewers eyes go first.

133
00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:12.730
And that happens because of multiple different things.

134
00:12:12.730 --> 00:12:15.790
But the biggest one is because of contrast

135
00:12:22.050 --> 00:12:26.820
makes you take some time to look at your drawing and then look at the reference and make sure that everything

136
00:12:26.820 --> 00:12:27.710
is matching up.

137
00:12:27.820 --> 00:12:32.450
If you see something that's not matching up go ahead and get in there and change it.

138
00:12:32.460 --> 00:12:35.940
Don't be afraid to draw or a race on your drawing.

139
00:12:57.530 --> 00:13:02.300
So now I'm just going in there and adding my final details and making sure that everything is correct

140
00:13:02.690 --> 00:13:06.850
checking my image and making sure that it matches up with my drawing.

141
00:13:07.100 --> 00:13:09.870
And I think that it's completely done now.

142
00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:13.070
So that brings us to the end of this lecture.

143
00:13:13.070 --> 00:13:20.060
So in this lecture you were able to watch me do a still life drawing of this banana and the fabric that

144
00:13:20.060 --> 00:13:24.980
it's playing on and you really should have gotten a good idea of how you can do this yourself because

145
00:13:25.010 --> 00:13:29.960
I didn't want to just give you an assignment to draw something from life without showing you how I do

146
00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:30.490
it.

147
00:13:30.500 --> 00:13:36.080
So your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and either draw this image of the bananas which you

148
00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:39.770
can download in the next lecture or even better yet.

149
00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:41.640
And I really highly recommend this.

150
00:13:41.750 --> 00:13:47.180
Find your own objects to draw and lay them out and go ahead and do a still life drawing of that and

151
00:13:47.180 --> 00:13:50.240
try to copy exactly what you see.

152
00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:55.520
Now if you really want to get really good at drawing you need to do at least 20 of these.

153
00:13:55.520 --> 00:14:01.850
And if you want to get amazingly good at drawing you need to do 100 to 1000 of these.

154
00:14:01.850 --> 00:14:05.930
Now I know that's a lot but some of you may not be that dedicated and that's all right.

155
00:14:06.050 --> 00:14:13.250
But for those of you that really want to become a great artist you need to do a lot of still life studies.

156
00:14:13.250 --> 00:14:17.730
Thanks for watching this lecturer and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
