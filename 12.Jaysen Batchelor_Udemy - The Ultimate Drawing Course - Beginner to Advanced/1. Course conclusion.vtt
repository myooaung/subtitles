00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.110
All right congratulations.

2
00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:05.040
You made it to the end of this drawing course.

3
00:00:05.100 --> 00:00:07.490
So at this point you should be pretty skilled.

4
00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:10.340
And a lot more skill than you were when you began.

5
00:00:10.340 --> 00:00:16.210
Now like I said at the beginning of this course I was going to have to draw the human eye in great detail.

6
00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:21.090
So what I want you to do now is I want you to go back to the beginning of this course and watch the

7
00:00:21.090 --> 00:00:24.080
part where we draw the eye again and try drawing it.

8
00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:28.890
I think you'll find that you're much more skilled now and your eyes will look a lot better once you

9
00:00:28.890 --> 00:00:29.330
do this.

10
00:00:29.370 --> 00:00:34.740
I want you to go ahead and take your old drawing of your eye and your new drawing of your eye and post

11
00:00:34.740 --> 00:00:40.460
those together in the Q and A section of the Course or the Facebook group and let us see your progress.

12
00:00:40.470 --> 00:00:44.510
I'm really looking forward to seeing how much you've grown through this course.

13
00:00:44.640 --> 00:00:49.710
Now now that you're done with this course you should have quite a pile of artwork.

14
00:00:49.710 --> 00:00:50.910
I know I do.

15
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:54.660
So definitely take a picture and share it with me too if you want.

16
00:00:54.660 --> 00:00:58.770
I really enjoyed to see how many drawings that you've created throughout this course.

17
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:03.660
Remember that if you have any questions please ask them in the Q&amp;A section of the course and I will

18
00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.060
answer every one.

19
00:01:05.070 --> 00:01:07.780
Guaranteed no student left behind.

20
00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:12.840
I want to help every single one of you achieve the skills that you want to achieve.

21
00:01:12.910 --> 00:01:17.850
So thanks for taking this course and I really enjoyed teaching you and have a great life.
