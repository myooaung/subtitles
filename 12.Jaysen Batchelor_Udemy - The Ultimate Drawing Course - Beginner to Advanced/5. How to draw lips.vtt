00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:05.480
All right in this lecture we're going to learn how to draw the lips.

2
00:00:05.510 --> 00:00:07.620
So let's go ahead and get started.

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:12.970
So the first thing I like to do when I'm drawing the lips is I like to draw a little bit of a curve

4
00:00:13.100 --> 00:00:20.110
but almost straight line just like so that's going to be crease or the crack between our upper left

5
00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:21.920
and our bottom left.

6
00:00:22.010 --> 00:00:26.210
Next thing I like to do is I like to mark where the top of my lip is going to be.

7
00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:30.600
So I put a mark like so then I'll do the same thing down here.

8
00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:34.820
And then I like to put a middle line right through the middle of this line.

9
00:00:34.820 --> 00:00:40.340
So I want to make sure it's as close to the middle as possible and now right here on this first Mark

10
00:00:40.400 --> 00:00:42.560
I'm going to go ahead and make the top sheet on my left.

11
00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:50.990
So it's basically going to be sort of a squashed letter the like so then I can go ahead and continue

12
00:00:50.990 --> 00:00:57.800
this line with a curve kind of like so and then it's going to turn into an inverted curve down to that

13
00:00:57.800 --> 00:00:58.290
point.

14
00:00:58.520 --> 00:01:04.490
So almost like a very stretched S curve will do the same thing on the other side so it's going to curve

15
00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:09.170
upwards first and then start to scoot downwards all the way back to this corner.

16
00:01:09.290 --> 00:01:14.460
And we want to try to get this shape on the side to be as symmetrical to that shape on that side so

17
00:01:14.460 --> 00:01:15.650
we'll continue to work with that.

18
00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:17.980
We get it looking correct.

19
00:01:18.230 --> 00:01:23.750
Once we have that shape established next we don't want to do is I want to go ahead and create my bottom

20
00:01:23.750 --> 00:01:24.020
lip.

21
00:01:24.020 --> 00:01:29.780
So the bottom lip is basically going to start right here and it's basically going to be an oval like

22
00:01:29.780 --> 00:01:30.490
so.

23
00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:36.860
So this is going to come a little bit past these two points of the upper lip and then that's going to

24
00:01:37.310 --> 00:01:40.400
morph into that corner right there.

25
00:01:40.400 --> 00:01:46.370
And same with this side so we'll go ahead and curve that into that corner right there.

26
00:01:46.370 --> 00:01:46.770
All right.

27
00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:47.960
Perfect.

28
00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:50.320
Now we can go ahead and start adding in our shading.

29
00:01:50.330 --> 00:01:56.060
So first the crease of our mouth or the crack between the two lips is going come a little bit further

30
00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.160
than the actual shape of the lips.

31
00:01:58.160 --> 00:02:02.970
And in some cases it might even come up a little bit like so.

32
00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:09.260
No Mansons sheeting underneath that next door we want to do is we want to add in that sheep between

33
00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:10.260
our two laps.

34
00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:12.980
So it's not going to be a straight line.

35
00:02:12.980 --> 00:02:18.410
The first shape we have to incorporate in there is this part right here that's right underneath this

36
00:02:18.590 --> 00:02:20.750
sort of V-shape of our lips.

37
00:02:21.020 --> 00:02:24.020
And basically it's just going to be another V-shape right underneath here.

38
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.170
And we want to try to create that little soft so that it's not such a hard line especially towards the

39
00:02:30.170 --> 00:02:31.480
ends of it.

40
00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:36.560
We're going to go ahead and create this shape right here which is basically going to be a curved shape

41
00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.670
that comes back into the corner of her mouth.

42
00:02:39.770 --> 00:02:42.540
Do the same thing on the other side like so.

43
00:02:42.680 --> 00:02:46.080
And now we have that shape for it the middle of our lips.

44
00:02:46.100 --> 00:02:48.680
Now we can go ahead and start shading it in.

45
00:02:48.740 --> 00:02:51.260
Now the light source is going to be coming down from the top.

46
00:02:51.350 --> 00:02:57.050
And this Libert here if we look at it from the side it's going to be at a down angle like so then this

47
00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:04.230
bottom lip is going to be a rounded shape like so and so that means that this surface right here which

48
00:03:04.250 --> 00:03:07.220
will be the surface right here is going to be our châteaux.

49
00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:14.870
So we're gonna go ahead and fill in the top area of our lips with a mid-tone châteaux just like so now

50
00:03:14.870 --> 00:03:17.310
we're going to go ahead and further detail this in.

51
00:03:17.330 --> 00:03:22.520
So the first thing we want to really shade in is we want to Durgan this area right here on this side

52
00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.940
of our V-shape right here.

53
00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:28.670
So that gets darkened in just a little bit.

54
00:03:28.730 --> 00:03:31.670
Next we want to go ahead and Durkan in this bottom area.

55
00:03:31.670 --> 00:03:37.130
So as the lips come down and into the mouth when you get a little bit of shadow in that area.

56
00:03:37.370 --> 00:03:39.560
So let's go ahead and have that shadow in.

57
00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:44.000
And we want to try to avoid adding too much to this area right here.

58
00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:49.330
So was just out on both sides of that.

59
00:03:49.540 --> 00:03:53.840
And we want that to blend into our other value or lighter value.

60
00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.620
I mean so out a little bit of value on this part we just don't want it to be as dirt.

61
00:04:00.140 --> 00:04:05.040
I'm going to go ahead and Durkan that line in a little bit more with a very dark hard line seam with

62
00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:06.300
this part here.

63
00:04:07.940 --> 00:04:17.440
And then we can go ahead and Durkan in these corner areas like so team with this side.

64
00:04:17.460 --> 00:04:17.850
All right.

65
00:04:17.850 --> 00:04:18.530
Great.

66
00:04:18.570 --> 00:04:23.160
Now we can go ahead and add a little bit more detail and thereby adding some lines and some cracks into

67
00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:28.720
the lips so make it look more realistic.

68
00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:33.570
And as we get to this middle area the lines are going to become more straight and then as they get further

69
00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:35.980
out they're going to become more curved once again.

70
00:04:42.900 --> 00:04:43.380
Great.

71
00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:47.340
Now let's go ahead and move on to the bottom part of the mouth or the bottom lip.

72
00:04:47.460 --> 00:04:51.180
So first off because we have this shape right here for the bottom lip.

73
00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:56.050
That means the light is going to be hitting this surface right here which is this main area of the lip.

74
00:04:56.280 --> 00:05:00.230
And as occurs underneath we're going to be getting some shadow underneath here.

75
00:05:00.270 --> 00:05:06.690
So let's start by adding in that shadow so basically we're just going to add in dirt shadow underneath

76
00:05:06.720 --> 00:05:12.960
this edge and it's slowly going to soften into our highlight.

77
00:05:13.050 --> 00:05:18.440
We can also soften that in to the skin of our face down here.

78
00:05:22.990 --> 00:05:28.000
Which also you notice that I'm searching sort of form that Shinichi with the chateau

79
00:05:32.050 --> 00:05:37.180
that I'm going to go ahead and add some shallow down this side of my worth and seen the sign

80
00:05:41.210 --> 00:05:46.820
that I'm going to start around the sheep out by using some more value just like so

81
00:05:49.810 --> 00:05:53.350
I can during the shadow in just a little bit more.

82
00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.250
And we also want to add a little bit of shadow on this edge because these lips the top lips would be

83
00:05:58.430 --> 00:06:01.440
creating a little bit of a cat shadow on the area.

84
00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:06.140
Then I'll add a little bit of shadow right down the middle because the lips kind of get split up into

85
00:06:06.140 --> 00:06:11.720
two parts to this side and this side they're usually divided by a little crease in the lips.

86
00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:18.590
Then we can go ahead and add in some wind detail in there to create some cracks on the lips or it not

87
00:06:18.590 --> 00:06:21.110
necessarily cracks but more wrinkles.

88
00:06:23.870 --> 00:06:24.700
Just like so.

89
00:06:24.740 --> 00:06:29.990
And I'm going to soften that Dirk edge on the upper lip a little bit more and bring that out into the

90
00:06:29.990 --> 00:06:33.480
skin part of my face.

91
00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:38.960
So it's a little bit too dark somebody go ahead and make that up.

92
00:06:41.740 --> 00:06:42.150
All right.

93
00:06:42.190 --> 00:06:42.880
Perfect.

94
00:06:42.880 --> 00:06:48.640
We might also want to Durgan in line just a titch bit more Durkan on this bottom lip a little bit more.

95
00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:54.670
Also then can also soften that dirt value into the light part of the skin.

96
00:06:56.880 --> 00:07:02.330
And then go ahead and add a little bit of a darker edge to his lips up there.

97
00:07:02.380 --> 00:07:06.970
Then Overall I'm going to Durkan these lips just a little bit more on the top side just because I want

98
00:07:06.970 --> 00:07:10.920
them to appear like they're more in shadow are great.

99
00:07:10.930 --> 00:07:14.250
So we just created the clips from the front view.

100
00:07:14.260 --> 00:07:17.660
Now I want to show you how to create the lips from a threequarters you.

101
00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:20.350
So it's very similar to drawing the lips this way.

102
00:07:20.350 --> 00:07:25.420
So first we start off with our middle line of our mouth and it's going to be a little bit curved because

103
00:07:25.420 --> 00:07:26.690
the face is curved.

104
00:07:27.070 --> 00:07:32.110
Then we're going to go ahead and create the little line over the crease in the mouth and it's going

105
00:07:32.110 --> 00:07:36.040
to be a little curved and it's going to be illustrator on this side and then over on the other side

106
00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:40.170
of this line is going to get a little bit more curved because we're looking at it in perspective.

107
00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.540
Next we're going to mark where the top of her lip is and the bottom of it.

108
00:07:44.830 --> 00:07:50.680
And we're going to go ahead and create a V shape on that line like so in this case the V-shape rather

109
00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:56.750
than being so spread out like so we're going to make a lot more squashed like we have already drawn

110
00:07:56.750 --> 00:08:03.980
here and we're going to go ahead and continue that line all the way back to the corner of her mouth.

111
00:08:04.030 --> 00:08:08.260
And then the side can come over all the way to the corner of her mouth like so.

112
00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.820
And because we're looking at this at an angle this side is a lot more squashed than this side.

113
00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:15.970
We'll go ahead and draw the bottom lip.

114
00:08:16.150 --> 00:08:22.590
So we're going to draw that in just like so and we'll bring it back to this corner.

115
00:08:22.620 --> 00:08:25.440
Now we can go ahead and shade that in.

116
00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:32.650
So I'm going to go ahead and start by adding this other V-shape on the bottom and then I'll go ahead

117
00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.440
and continue this middle line.

118
00:08:34.450 --> 00:08:36.460
Back to the corner of my mouth.

119
00:08:36.730 --> 00:08:41.650
Now we can go ahead and shade that and so we're going to start with this bottom edge make it pretty

120
00:08:41.650 --> 00:08:42.010
dark

121
00:08:49.290 --> 00:08:53.670
them can also Durkan this edge a little bit more because maybe it's being hit by the light less maybe

122
00:08:53.670 --> 00:08:56.100
the light is coming more from this angle.

123
00:08:57.030 --> 00:08:59.470
So this is going to be a little bit more in shadow

124
00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:13.330
go ahead and have some shadow to the bottom edge of the lab the top I mean they're going to go ahead

125
00:09:13.350 --> 00:09:15.220
and cheat in this whole shape.

126
00:09:15.310 --> 00:09:20.400
So it becomes the shadow side of our lips that we can go ahead and move on to the bottom part of her

127
00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:20.750
lip.

128
00:09:20.770 --> 00:09:25.250
So we'll go ahead and add in a dark shadow on the underside of her lip.

129
00:09:34.650 --> 00:09:38.920
Like so normal out a little bit more of a shadow under this part of the lips.

130
00:09:38.970 --> 00:09:43.920
We have a little bit more of a cast a shadow and we can also darken this edge of the lip a little bit

131
00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:46.900
more since the shadows on this side of the face.

132
00:09:52.150 --> 00:09:57.540
And so now we've drawn the lips from a three quarters to the last view we need to draw the lives in

133
00:09:57.560 --> 00:09:59.430
is from a side profile.

134
00:09:59.490 --> 00:10:03.330
So the way you draw the lips from a side view is very simple.

135
00:10:03.330 --> 00:10:09.690
So first you start off with your middle one like so and then you need to go ahead and and the top part

136
00:10:09.750 --> 00:10:15.240
of your lips and then you need to add the bottom part of your lips and the bottom parts are basically

137
00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:24.320
going to be a rounded curve that will then turn into sort of a raindrop type of a shape.

138
00:10:24.450 --> 00:10:31.770
So then the top or lips is almost going to be a straight line back to that point that will turn into

139
00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:32.830
the top lip.

140
00:10:32.940 --> 00:10:36.720
And we're kind of creating a little bit of a paraphrase here or something to go ahead and bring the

141
00:10:36.720 --> 00:10:38.790
sheep back a little bit more.

142
00:10:38.830 --> 00:10:40.930
Well go ahead and embrace that.

143
00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:46.430
And then these lips will turn into the chins and curve that I like so.

144
00:10:46.530 --> 00:10:49.560
And then basically the top area gets all the chateau

145
00:10:54.130 --> 00:10:58.620
and then this bottom lip gets a little bit of shadow on the bottom side.

146
00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:07.270
So like so and then it gets a little bit of shattering here and you can go ahead and further detail

147
00:11:07.270 --> 00:11:07.890
that out.

148
00:11:08.080 --> 00:11:12.630
But that's basically how you draw the lifts from a profile view.

149
00:11:12.970 --> 00:11:13.480
All right.

150
00:11:13.510 --> 00:11:16.110
So that brings us to the end of this lecture.

151
00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:23.380
So in this lecture you learn how to draw the lips in a front view a three quarter view and a profile

152
00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:24.130
of you.

153
00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:27.920
Your assignment for this lecture is to go ahead and draw these lips.

154
00:11:28.150 --> 00:11:33.160
And then I want you to post one of them to either the Q&amp;A section of the Course or the Facebook group.

155
00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:37.920
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
