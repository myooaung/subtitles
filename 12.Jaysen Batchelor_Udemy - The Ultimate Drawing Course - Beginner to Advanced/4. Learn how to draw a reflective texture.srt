1
00:00:00,310 --> 00:00:05,810
Right in this lecture we're going to be going over how to create a reflective texture.

2
00:00:05,850 --> 00:00:08,520
So what exactly is a reflective texture.

3
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:14,370
Well the texture of a reflective surface is just a very smooth glossy surface.

4
00:00:14,430 --> 00:00:19,800
So if something is really rough it's going to be less reflective and a really good example of something

5
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:24,420
that's highly reflective and very smooth is if you're in your bathroom.

6
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:26,240
So let's go ahead and get started.

7
00:00:26,280 --> 00:00:31,030
So the first thing we're going to draw is we're going to draw a sphere that is reflective.

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:36,270
Now this isn't going to be reflective like a mirror but it's going to be reflective enough that it looks

9
00:00:36,360 --> 00:00:37,370
glossy.

10
00:00:37,650 --> 00:00:43,470
So the first thing you need to understand is that reflection is just a copy of everything around it

11
00:00:43,560 --> 00:00:45,740
being projected onto your object.

12
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:51,210
So with this sphere for example it's going to be reflecting anything that's pointing directly at it.

13
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:55,600
So the first thing we're going to take into account is that it's sitting on a white surface.

14
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:01,860
That means it's going to be getting a light reflection onto the bottom of our bowl then our horizon

15
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,650
line is going to be dark and as it moves up it's going to turn into a lighter gradient.

16
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:10,290
So let's go ahead and get started so I can show you what I mean.

17
00:01:10,290 --> 00:01:18,150
So first off I'm at in my horizon line like so and next I'm going to go ahead and start adding in my

18
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:18,810
reflection.

19
00:01:18,810 --> 00:01:25,650
So starting with the darker area and this isn't going to be a completely reflective ball it's going

20
00:01:25,650 --> 00:01:28,930
to be has some really microscopic rough areas.

21
00:01:28,950 --> 00:01:35,490
And so that's going to allow us to make this more of a reflection rather than a really sharp perfect

22
00:01:35,490 --> 00:01:36,530
reflection.

23
00:01:36,780 --> 00:01:43,650
So we're adding in this dark area here that's going to slowly transition into a layer value because

24
00:01:43,710 --> 00:01:48,630
that's what it's going to be reflecting back here where we have our background or background is going

25
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:53,800
to start out darker and it's slowly going to transition into a lighter color.

26
00:01:53,970 --> 00:01:56,790
So we'll have that nice gradient background.

27
00:01:59,380 --> 00:02:03,350
And for now I'm just going to rough this in and we'll add in a lot more detail to make it look more

28
00:02:03,350 --> 00:02:05,920
realistic here in the next little while.

29
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:07,340
But for now we just want to rough it.

30
00:02:07,340 --> 00:02:09,910
And so you start to get the idea of what I'm doing.

31
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:15,230
And then our floor or area that the ball is sitting on is going to be white which is why we're getting

32
00:02:15,230 --> 00:02:17,830
this white reflection on the bottom of our ball.

33
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:24,560
So now let's go ahead and get started adding in some real Falcon so I'm going to start off with this

34
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:25,520
middle area.

35
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,190
And so I'm going to add in a really dark value and this isn't necessarily a shadow.

36
00:02:30,200 --> 00:02:31,730
This isn't our core shadow.

37
00:02:31,730 --> 00:02:36,170
This is a reflection of this background area that's surrounding our bowl

38
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:45,140
slowly change that into the next lighter value.

39
00:02:45,270 --> 00:02:51,420
So we're going to start creating that nice gradient from one dark value to a lighter value as we move

40
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:52,810
up our sphere.

41
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,270
Now as we get up more here to the top let's say that we have a light source right here in front of it

42
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:09,040
and it's a lamp.

43
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:09,570
OK.

44
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,840
So that means that we're going to see that reflection on our glossy ball.

45
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:22,310
So let's go ahead and create a sheeplike So maybe a little bit smaller like so and we're going to leave

46
00:03:22,310 --> 00:03:26,180
that area out right because that's where our light source is going to be coming from.

47
00:03:26,180 --> 00:03:28,450
So I'm going to go ahead and erase away the edges.

48
00:03:28,460 --> 00:03:29,700
So it's not so dark.

49
00:03:29,900 --> 00:03:35,060
Now we can go ahead and start adding in our value right up to that point.

50
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:58,300
And we can start darkening this in more and the darker the better the more contrast the more it's going

51
00:03:58,300 --> 00:04:25,820
to look like it's reflecting.

52
00:04:25,850 --> 00:04:26,890
All right.

53
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,430
Now let's go ahead and move down to this bottom area so I'm to start off by lately adding a darker coat

54
00:04:32,850 --> 00:04:39,240
or a darker value on top of this white area because as it reflects onto this ball it might be diluted

55
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:41,250
by the color of the ball.

56
00:04:41,250 --> 00:04:45,900
Next I'm going go ahead and Adam my cast shadow and now my cash it was actually not going to be a very

57
00:04:45,900 --> 00:04:48,310
hard edge and it's going to be behind it.

58
00:04:48,330 --> 00:04:52,490
So it's going to come back it like so rather than to the side of it.

59
00:04:52,630 --> 00:04:54,850
Then I can go ahead and begin to Durkan that

60
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:03,860
like I said I wanted to be really soft So we're going to have a nice gradual change from one value to

61
00:05:03,860 --> 00:05:18,660
our weight value of our surface.

62
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:19,810
Great.

63
00:05:19,930 --> 00:05:25,300
Now since this ball is reflecting or bottom surface that means it's also going to be reflecting the

64
00:05:25,300 --> 00:05:26,090
shadow.

65
00:05:26,260 --> 00:05:29,460
So we can add this shadow into the reflection on our ball.

66
00:05:29,470 --> 00:05:34,030
So don't go ahead and bring that shadow way up to this edge like so honorable.

67
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,330
Same with this side.

68
00:05:36,940 --> 00:05:40,010
And then I can go ahead and begin to blend that in.

69
00:06:02,230 --> 00:06:07,120
Perfect now really quick I want to go ahead and come back up here to this top area and I'm going to

70
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,380
Durkan this just a little bit more.

71
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,670
So it stands out more and creates more of an illusion of reflection.

72
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,150
All right now let's go ahead and move on to our background area.

73
00:06:21,170 --> 00:06:23,530
So our background needs to match in this area.

74
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:28,540
It can be a little bit lighter because remember this ball is going to be a little bit darker with a

75
00:06:28,540 --> 00:06:29,930
glossy coat over it.

76
00:06:29,950 --> 00:06:34,840
So that means it's going to cause everything on it to be a little bit darker so such as this white area

77
00:06:34,870 --> 00:06:40,120
that's reflecting the white surface it's a little bit darker than the actual white surface because of

78
00:06:40,120 --> 00:06:43,730
the fact that the ball is a darker color.

79
00:06:43,820 --> 00:06:49,500
So let's go ahead and start adding in that gradient backgrounds.

80
00:06:50,310 --> 00:06:53,690
So I'm starting with the darkest color which is this color right here.

81
00:06:53,950 --> 00:06:58,300
And then I'm to go ahead and slowly fade into my next lightest color and I'm just going to do the all

82
00:06:58,300 --> 00:07:02,780
the way up and then I'll do the same thing on the other side.

83
00:08:00,210 --> 00:08:01,120
All right perfect.

84
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:08,010
Now I'm going to go ahead and add in a box around my drawing so becomes a better composition.

85
00:08:10,370 --> 00:08:10,650
Great.

86
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:16,570
So now we've drawn it reflective texture which Let's go over it again real quick what a reflective texture

87
00:08:16,600 --> 00:08:17,050
is.

88
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:23,500
It's just a very smooth surface with a glossy coating on it that allows it to reflect the world around

89
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:23,820
it.

90
00:08:23,980 --> 00:08:30,100
So basically all the reflection is it's the objects surrounding it that are being projected onto your

91
00:08:30,100 --> 00:08:31,110
object.

92
00:08:31,150 --> 00:08:36,250
So right here we have the bottom surface which is this white area which is the surface of the ball sitting

93
00:08:36,250 --> 00:08:36,940
on.

94
00:08:36,940 --> 00:08:43,030
And then we have this black area on her bowl which is just the reflection of this background area that

95
00:08:43,030 --> 00:08:48,370
slowly turns into a lighter gray which is a gradient which we also see honorable here.

96
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:52,120
And then this a lighter area right here is our light source.

97
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:57,070
Now let's look at an example of a highly reflective piece of artwork.

98
00:08:57,270 --> 00:09:00,870
So in this example this is created by MC Escher.

99
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:07,710
He's a very famous artist and he created this drawing by creating a sphere that was highly reflective

100
00:09:07,770 --> 00:09:09,910
exactly like a mirror.

101
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,050
So you can see here that everything around the sphere is being reflected right onto the sphere and being

102
00:09:16,050 --> 00:09:19,870
projected onto it and also being warped into the shape of the sphere.

103
00:09:19,890 --> 00:09:24,810
That's another thing to understand about reflection is that when it's being projected onto an object

104
00:09:25,020 --> 00:09:28,410
it's being warped into the shape of that object.

105
00:09:28,590 --> 00:09:31,110
So how can we do something like this ourselves.

106
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,280
Well let's give it a shot.

107
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:37,890
So first off what we need to understand is that the sphere can be broken up into a grid system which

108
00:09:37,890 --> 00:09:42,340
is sort of like a perspective system for a linear perspective.

109
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:47,860
But basically if we have a board here the middle one it is going to be completely straight.

110
00:09:48,090 --> 00:09:52,980
Then if we come all the way to this edge this is the most curve or line is ever going to be is on that

111
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:53,570
edge.

112
00:09:53,580 --> 00:09:59,520
Same with this edge and then we can find in the middle line that is about the middle of the curvature

113
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:01,290
of this straight line and this curved line.

114
00:10:01,290 --> 00:10:06,900
So it's probably going to be somewhere about there and then we can find one in the middle of each one

115
00:10:06,900 --> 00:10:07,620
of these sections.

116
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:14,720
So the next one is probably going to be about there and then we can get this section or here and slope.

117
00:10:14,730 --> 00:10:21,630
So as it gets to the edge of our bowl you'll see how it becomes more and more curved.

118
00:10:21,900 --> 00:10:23,790
Let's go ahead and do the same thing for the other side.

119
00:10:23,790 --> 00:10:26,650
So we're just going to try to copy exactly what we see here.

120
00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:32,400
And we should start with the middle line and then work our way from section to section.

121
00:10:32,420 --> 00:10:36,900
But I've already started from the inner side so that's fine.

122
00:10:42,080 --> 00:10:48,380
So now Arbel has been broken up into sections and we've added added that Kirch perspective in there.

123
00:10:48,380 --> 00:10:50,530
Now we also need to do it in the other direction.

124
00:10:50,540 --> 00:10:53,690
So if we turn to paper like so we can go ahead and do the same thing.

125
00:10:53,690 --> 00:10:58,430
So we draw a line like so and then we're going to go ahead and draw on both sides of this like we did

126
00:10:58,430 --> 00:10:59,190
before.

127
00:11:14,210 --> 00:11:14,580
All right.

128
00:11:14,750 --> 00:11:15,140
Great.

129
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:21,020
So what this grid system is is it's basically a normal grid system that's sitting in front of it but

130
00:11:21,020 --> 00:11:24,780
it's being projected or reflected onto our actual ball.

131
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:30,110
And so when we draw an image onto a ball we need it to warp to this perspective.

132
00:11:30,110 --> 00:11:31,770
So let's go ahead and try this.

133
00:11:31,790 --> 00:11:34,790
So if we go ahead and draw another sphere right here

134
00:11:37,770 --> 00:11:43,380
and then in this example we're going to draw the reflection of a room kind of like an MC Ascher's drawing.

135
00:11:43,590 --> 00:11:48,420
So first off we need to keep in mind where each one of our grid system lines are.

136
00:11:48,530 --> 00:11:54,860
And so we can lightly sketch an some some guidelines in there but we don't want to sketch them all in

137
00:11:54,870 --> 00:11:57,050
because we don't want it to interfere with their drawing.

138
00:11:57,060 --> 00:12:01,820
But maybe one right there in the middle between our straight line and our outer curved line.

139
00:12:03,570 --> 00:12:06,410
And I will do the same thing going in the other direction.

140
00:12:09,990 --> 00:12:12,410
And these will just help us guide our lines.

141
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,300
So let's start off by creating a character so let's say there is a counter right here.

142
00:12:18,730 --> 00:12:19,850
Like so.

143
00:12:20,840 --> 00:12:26,320
And then that counter is going to curve along with this line right here all the way to that edge.

144
00:12:26,420 --> 00:12:31,580
And then we can go ahead and add and another thing over here so let's try adding in a table.

145
00:12:31,610 --> 00:12:36,110
So a table is going to be a little bit taller and it's going to curve all the way out to that point

146
00:12:36,110 --> 00:12:36,970
right there.

147
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,850
And then we can add in a leg and the leg needs to curve with this line right here.

148
00:12:46,910 --> 00:12:53,470
So we'll go ahead and add that in like so then let's go ahead and add some walls to her room.

149
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:58,370
So when I go ahead and add a war here it and I need to follow this perspective.

150
00:12:58,910 --> 00:13:01,400
So I'm trying to follow that line there.

151
00:13:04,010 --> 00:13:08,420
And then I'll go ahead and add in a line for my back wall which will be a little bit curved along with

152
00:13:08,420 --> 00:13:17,890
these lines and then I'm going go ahead and add in this back wall over here and then add in a roof.

153
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:26,330
So and then I need to add in a window so my window also needs to curve with my perspective.

154
00:13:27,190 --> 00:13:29,780
I can go ahead and draw no lines like so.

155
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,390
And those actually need to be a little bit more curved too.

156
00:13:33,400 --> 00:13:34,860
All right perfect.

157
00:13:34,870 --> 00:13:39,600
Now let's go ahead and add something else in there like let's say we wanted to add a refrigerator.

158
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,500
Well we can go ahead and add that refrigerator in and we just need to make sure we follow these curved

159
00:13:44,500 --> 00:13:45,470
perspective lines.

160
00:13:45,490 --> 00:13:53,830
So there is a refrigerator and it comes back to the wall so it can break that up into two different

161
00:13:53,890 --> 00:14:00,520
areas so we have our freezer and our fridge area of that fridge Raider and we can also add handles onto

162
00:14:00,520 --> 00:14:01,130
that.

163
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,940
And then let's add one more thing let's add a rug in there.

164
00:14:03,940 --> 00:14:13,560
So if we add a rug in right here we just need to make sure that it follows the curve of our ball

165
00:14:16,730 --> 00:14:19,420
and alleged to my counter also.

166
00:14:19,530 --> 00:14:23,330
So then I can go ahead and Durcan the edges of my bill

167
00:14:32,820 --> 00:14:36,510
and then I can go ahead and also add in some light and shadow into my drawing.

168
00:14:36,510 --> 00:14:44,220
So for example on this side of my counter that might be my core shadow side then this might be my highlight

169
00:14:44,220 --> 00:14:44,960
side.

170
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,360
And then this also might be my Halet side so this other edge of my table leg is going to get the shadow.

171
00:14:50,580 --> 00:14:59,200
And then we also might make this table top a darker value altogether like so and seam with our rug.

172
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,810
A rug might be a darker value.

173
00:15:03,810 --> 00:15:06,000
And then our walls might be a darker value too.

174
00:15:06,030 --> 00:15:12,110
So this side it might be a lighter wall in this middle one it might be a darker wall.

175
00:15:13,140 --> 00:15:18,120
That'll be nice too because that'll create a focal point in our reflection which will be this window

176
00:15:18,120 --> 00:15:27,770
because that's where we're creating the most contrast.

177
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:30,750
Me go ahead and that a shadow to this side.

178
00:15:30,750 --> 00:15:41,180
Also like so and then we can go ahead and add in a little bit of a darker edge along the sphere.

179
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:47,020
And we might even add a picture frame on the wall here.

180
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:53,650
Keeping with the curvature of our perspective maybe another picture frame over here maybe even a second

181
00:15:53,650 --> 00:15:58,610
one and the second one is going to get squished a little bit as it curves around the edge of our bowl.

182
00:15:59,230 --> 00:16:08,980
And then we can go ahead and add in a shadow too if we wanted to just to make it look like it's grounded.

183
00:16:09,350 --> 00:16:09,760
All right.

184
00:16:09,770 --> 00:16:14,390
But that's the basic idea of making a really highly reflective sphere.

185
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:19,910
So when you're adding a highly reflective texture to an object you need to imagine that the surroundings

186
00:16:19,970 --> 00:16:22,370
around it are being projected onto that object.

187
00:16:22,490 --> 00:16:26,280
But also they're being warped to the shape of that object.

188
00:16:26,300 --> 00:16:30,890
I know it can be a little bit complicated and old take a lot of practice and a lot of studying to understand

189
00:16:30,890 --> 00:16:31,880
how this works.

190
00:16:32,090 --> 00:16:37,910
But for now this should be enough information to get you by with creating reflective textures.

191
00:16:37,910 --> 00:16:42,170
Thanks for watching this lecture and I really look forward to seeing you in the next one.
