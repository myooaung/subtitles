1
00:00:03,220 --> 00:00:09,630
Aren't in this lecture I'm going to show you how to draw an actual well rendered image with perspective

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,380
because up to this point we've only been drawing really simple shapes and unrealistic houses and buildings.

3
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:20,490
But I want to show you how to actually draw a realistic drawing that is well rendered has lights and

4
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:23,060
shadows and has a lot of detail in it.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:24,680
So let's go ahead and get started.

6
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:28,640
The first thing I've done here is I've created my 60 percent mark.

7
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,000
So if you remember the last lecture we went over how you want to stay within 60 percent of the space

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,050
between your two vanishing points.

9
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,420
Now I'm creating the 60 percent mark vertically.

10
00:00:39,830 --> 00:00:45,720
And so now that I had that marked off I know within what space I want to create my image.

11
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,820
So the first thing I'm going to do is I'm going to create the basic shape for my building.

12
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:52,870
Now I'm not sure what type building this is going to be yet.

13
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:56,700
I just want to figure out where I want that building to be.

14
00:00:59,240 --> 00:01:03,960
And I accidentally drew this to the wrong point and drew it to my 60 percent point.

15
00:01:04,130 --> 00:01:08,360
And so I need to erase this and I need to fix that so it's going to mine.

16
00:01:08,370 --> 00:01:09,650
Vanishing Point.

17
00:01:09,740 --> 00:01:13,240
So make sure you're always double checking that you're going to the correct point.

18
00:01:19,760 --> 00:01:23,440
Now adding in my vertical lines for the edges of my building.

19
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:31,420
Next I'm going to go ahead and draw in two vertical lines and then I'm going to draw in a horizontal

20
00:01:31,420 --> 00:01:34,980
line across here and now I have the base for my doorway.

21
00:01:35,350 --> 00:01:40,320
And then I can start adding in perspective lines to create a ledge on that doorway.

22
00:01:42,210 --> 00:01:45,900
I have to add this bottom ledge so great.

23
00:01:45,910 --> 00:01:52,300
So now I have my doorway and it's nice and indented next I want to add a circle window above my door.

24
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:58,360
And so what I need to do is I first need to create a square shape and perspective and then like we did

25
00:01:58,360 --> 00:01:59,250
before earlier.

26
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:00,410
And a court in a lecture.

27
00:02:00,430 --> 00:02:05,740
We're going to go ahead and create the X through our square and then we're going to create the plus

28
00:02:05,740 --> 00:02:09,400
sign through it so we can find where that diamond shape is.

29
00:02:09,610 --> 00:02:11,690
And now we can go ahead and draw that diamond shape.

30
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,420
And I'm actually going to skip the diamond shape part because for me I'm able to just see about where

31
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:19,840
my circle should be and I can just sketch that in really quickly.

32
00:02:20,260 --> 00:02:20,650
Next.

33
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:27,640
Let's go ahead and add a bottom edge to that door and a crack in the door so that it's a two door door.

34
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:34,570
Next I'm going to go ahead and add the lines for sort of a cylinder type tower and now I'm going to

35
00:02:34,570 --> 00:02:36,340
find the center of this square.

36
00:02:36,340 --> 00:02:40,480
The reason why I'm doing that is because I want to create a peaked roof and I want that piece to be

37
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:42,780
right in the center of my wall.

38
00:02:42,790 --> 00:02:47,710
So now that I know where that center is I can make a point on my center line and connect that back to

39
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:50,260
each corner of my cube.

40
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:52,020
And now we have a peat roof.

41
00:02:52,060 --> 00:02:58,160
Next I need to finish up the top of that roof by adding in that line back to my vanishing point.

42
00:02:58,510 --> 00:03:01,420
And now I'm going to start marking about where I want.

43
00:03:01,420 --> 00:03:03,750
The windows on the side of my building to be.

44
00:03:03,880 --> 00:03:05,530
Now these windows are going to have arches.

45
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,280
But for now we're just going to create the rectangle part of them

46
00:03:11,820 --> 00:03:16,410
and notice that I'm drawing my lines really lightly so I can come back any race them later cause a lot

47
00:03:16,410 --> 00:03:22,760
of these are guidelines and they're not the final product line that I need to create a square shape

48
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:25,820
across these windows because we're going to make them arch.

49
00:03:25,850 --> 00:03:33,220
And so we need to find where that square is to make those circles that I'm going to go ahead and add

50
00:03:33,220 --> 00:03:36,230
the other crossing line so we can find those centers.

51
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:46,430
And then we can go ahead and draw a vertical line comes straight up through the center of that and then

52
00:03:46,460 --> 00:03:49,570
we're going to come to our vanishing point and draw a line that goes straight through the center of

53
00:03:49,580 --> 00:03:51,230
all the rest of these.

54
00:03:51,290 --> 00:03:57,080
And now we can go ahead and sketch in those rounded corners to get our arch nominal leave out the bottom

55
00:03:57,260 --> 00:04:02,170
arch because we just want the top part of the circle and so we can leave out that bottom part.

56
00:04:07,710 --> 00:04:14,130
Next I'm going to go ahead and create a ledge for an edge for our door or windows so that they look

57
00:04:14,130 --> 00:04:16,300
like they're actually indented into the building.

58
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:25,210
Now going to go ahead and create the rounded edge for my tower because I want it to be cylindrical so

59
00:04:25,210 --> 00:04:31,010
I'm first going to create a square up here in perspective that's at the top of my tower.

60
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:36,420
And then I'll go ahead and put the X through it so I can figure out where that circle is in perspective.

61
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:38,840
And then I'll go ahead and sketch that circle in

62
00:04:48,600 --> 00:04:56,140
there I'm going to go ahead and put a dome on top of that and I'm going to go ahead and create the other

63
00:04:56,230 --> 00:05:00,550
side of my edge for my wall on the inside of my window.

64
00:05:00,940 --> 00:05:05,140
And then I can go ahead and find the bottom of that by placing my ruler to the vanishing point and then

65
00:05:05,140 --> 00:05:13,370
connecting them and then I just want to find about where that ledges there so I can easily sketch in

66
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:15,160
the inside of the curve.

67
00:05:15,650 --> 00:05:16,160
So

68
00:05:19,450 --> 00:05:23,400
all right and then it's important to really think about your drawing and what you want to do next.

69
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:27,960
So I took a little bit of time to stare at it for a while and figure out what I wanted to do next and

70
00:05:28,020 --> 00:05:32,780
what I decided is I want to add some flower boxes here on the side of the building.

71
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:37,150
So going to go ahead and sketch in some very simple cubes.

72
00:05:37,150 --> 00:05:41,520
And once again I sketch to the wrong point so I need to erase that then I'll come back to the right

73
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,240
point.

74
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,710
So these come all the way back to your vanishing point and then I'll go ahead and get the top side of

75
00:05:46,710 --> 00:05:47,170
that

76
00:05:50,530 --> 00:05:56,350
and then I'll go ahead and create the top surface of my box and then I want to break this up into two

77
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:04,180
separate pieces because I don't just want one long continuous flower box I want multiple ones and I'll

78
00:06:04,180 --> 00:06:16,190
go ahead and connect to the bottom edge and I always make sure that you're leading back to a point.

79
00:06:16,350 --> 00:06:16,800
All right.

80
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,160
And once again I'm sitting and thinking trying to figure out what I want to do next.

81
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:23,130
Make sure you do that takes some time.

82
00:06:23,430 --> 00:06:28,190
So I decided that I'm going to add a ledge in this box and then I can add some plants on top of it.

83
00:06:28,200 --> 00:06:32,580
So at this point I basically have all of my perspective laid out and now it's time to start sketching

84
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:33,780
in some detail.

85
00:06:36,230 --> 00:06:41,180
You always want to start with what's in front first because if you start with what's in back you don't

86
00:06:41,180 --> 00:06:44,870
necessarily know what's going to be in front of it that you might have to end up doing a lot of erasing.

87
00:06:44,870 --> 00:06:49,460
And so that's why I'm starting with these planter boxes first so that then I don't have to come back

88
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,970
and embrace things that I accidentally drew where I wanted my plants

89
00:06:58,010 --> 00:06:59,820
and I'll go ahead and do this back one

90
00:07:10,320 --> 00:07:12,500
I'm going to go ahead and add in a tree there.

91
00:07:13,520 --> 00:07:15,780
And with the tree I don't even have to worry about perspective.

92
00:07:15,790 --> 00:07:17,380
I can just draw a tree in

93
00:07:27,640 --> 00:07:30,080
I'm going to go ahead and erase away some of these lines.

94
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:33,480
Next.

95
00:07:33,720 --> 00:07:38,040
Now go ahead and start darkening in these lines so they become much more solidified.

96
00:07:46,710 --> 00:07:50,360
And make sure you only solidify the lines that you are sure you want to keep.

97
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:56,120
If you're not sure leave them light until you know later that you want them or you don't want them because

98
00:07:56,150 --> 00:07:59,520
if you darken them it's going to be really hard to come back and erase them

99
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:16,830
I'm going to go ahead and darken in the circle and then add in a second circle with this one because

100
00:08:16,920 --> 00:08:19,810
this circle is going to also be indented like the doorway.

101
00:08:20,190 --> 00:08:26,800
And then I'm going to go ahead and add in a window with criss crossing boards.

102
00:08:28,200 --> 00:08:30,510
Next I'm going to go ahead and darken my door.

103
00:08:39,820 --> 00:08:46,740
Get this bottom part of the door and then I want to Durkan that crack in the door and I can Durkan all

104
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,510
of these lines because I know I want to keep these and notice that I'm not going all the way up I'm

105
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:56,190
stopping right at the beginning of that circle because the line won't continue after that.

106
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,040
It's going to curve into that circle.

107
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:02,520
Then I can go ahead and Durkan in those circles.

108
00:09:03,230 --> 00:09:03,860
So

109
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,360
great then I get to go ahead and Durkan these lines.

110
00:09:16,100 --> 00:09:18,980
Then lastly Durkan in this line right here.

111
00:09:22,940 --> 00:09:28,430
Next I'm going to go ahead and solidify the lines down here at the bottom of the windows and then I'm

112
00:09:28,430 --> 00:09:33,020
going go ahead and solidify the lines at the bottom of the wall and notice that I'm skipping where the

113
00:09:33,020 --> 00:09:35,790
windows are because I'm going to erase those guidelines.

114
00:09:37,400 --> 00:09:42,630
And I'll go ahead and solidify the cylinder and then solidify that dome and even add some detail on

115
00:09:42,630 --> 00:09:42,930
it.

116
00:09:45,280 --> 00:09:50,320
Now what I want to do next is I want to go ahead and add a center line down the middle of my windows

117
00:09:50,380 --> 00:09:52,680
so I can break them up into separate pins.

118
00:09:53,940 --> 00:09:57,910
Then I get to go ahead and draw lines across my windows like so.

119
00:09:58,410 --> 00:10:10,890
And this will be the horizontal dividing panes.

120
00:10:11,280 --> 00:10:17,280
So I'm trying to keep them as evenly spaced as possible and also notice that I'm coming back to my vanishing

121
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,590
point to create these lines.

122
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:24,270
You always want your lines that are going horizontally to always be going back to a vanishing point.

123
00:10:25,770 --> 00:10:25,930
Right.

124
00:10:26,090 --> 00:10:27,590
Great.

125
00:10:27,590 --> 00:10:32,020
Now lastly I'm going to add a little bit of some detail on the ground just some random lines that are

126
00:10:32,210 --> 00:10:33,530
that are in perspective.

127
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:39,530
That way it helps us see the perspective on the floor and it will also help guide me later when I want

128
00:10:39,530 --> 00:10:42,500
to lay down bricks and rocks and stuff on the ground.

129
00:10:46,100 --> 00:10:48,580
All right that brings us to the end of this lecture.

130
00:10:48,620 --> 00:10:55,220
So in this lecture we drew a entire building and some planter boxes next to it and we made sure that

131
00:10:55,220 --> 00:10:57,120
we were following the 60 percent rule.

132
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:01,700
And we also wanted to really think about how our building was shaped and make sure that it was actually

133
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:05,600
shaped like a real building and not a really exaggerated building.

134
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:10,700
In the next lecture we're going to go ahead and add more detail to this and also light and shadow and

135
00:11:10,700 --> 00:11:13,370
turn into a more realistic drawing.

136
00:11:13,370 --> 00:11:16,890
Thanks for watching and I really look forward to seeing you in the next lecture.
