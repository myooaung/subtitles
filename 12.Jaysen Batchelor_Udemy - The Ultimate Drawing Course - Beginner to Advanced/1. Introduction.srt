Hi and welcome to the course.

2
00:00:02,270 --> 00:00:07,030
My name's Jason and I'll be your instructor on teaching you how to draw.

3
00:00:07,050 --> 00:00:11,580
Now let me share a little bit about myself so you know who I am and you know that you can trust me to

4
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:13,070
teach you how to draw.

5
00:00:13,370 --> 00:00:20,400
At the age of 17 I began a six month internship with an animation studio and eventually that turned

6
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,840
into a paying job with the end of my internship.

7
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,190
Now the reason why I'm sharing the story with you is because I want to point out that the only reason

8
00:00:29,190 --> 00:00:34,270
why I got the internship and then got the job was because I was able to draw.

9
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:40,290
I didn't even know how to use Photoshop which was the primary program that they used in order to create

10
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:42,060
their own media.

11
00:00:42,060 --> 00:00:43,610
But I didn't even know how to use it.

12
00:00:43,630 --> 00:00:44,750
I knew how to draw.

13
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:51,030
So I just want to stress the importance of being able to draw and understanding how the fundamentals

14
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:53,700
of drawing now really quick.

15
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:56,850
Let's go over what we're going to be covering in this course.

16
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,650
So the first thing we're going to do in the course is we're going to draw on.

17
00:01:00,900 --> 00:01:06,000
Now the reason why we're going to draw this high is to test your skills and then at the end of the course

18
00:01:06,070 --> 00:01:09,590
you're going to have you draw the same eye and see how far you've come.

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,170
After going through this course next we're going to go over the fundamentals starting with the line

20
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:19,830
we're going to learn why line is so important and all the different types of things you can use lines

21
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,970
to create them we're going to go over a sheet and form to create entire landscape pictures and even

22
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:33,810
characters then we're going to go over value and contrast and how important it is to have value in contrast

23
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,390
in your drawings go over space and perspective which also is very important.

24
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:45,180
And then we'll go over how to create still life drawings which is vital if you want to become a skilled

25
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:46,230
artist.

26
00:01:46,350 --> 00:01:52,170
You need to be able to draw from real life objects that were going to go over creating textures so that

27
00:01:52,170 --> 00:01:54,910
you can add some realism to your drawings.

28
00:01:55,110 --> 00:02:00,390
And then we're going to go over the human face and also how to draw the human figure.

29
00:02:00,460 --> 00:02:06,120
And lastly I've thrown in a bony section where I'm going to teach you how I create animations style

30
00:02:06,120 --> 00:02:09,160
sketches and I'll break it down step by step.

31
00:02:10,040 --> 00:02:12,850
So I hope you're really excited to get into this course.

32
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:13,720
I know I am.

33
00:02:13,880 --> 00:02:15,760
And I look forward to seeing your work.

34
00:02:15,770 --> 00:02:17,730
So let's go ahead and jump right in.
