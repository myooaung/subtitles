00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.940
We've used a lot of elements during this course

00:00:02.940 --> 00:00:06.240
without thinking too much about how they display on the screen.

00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:10.185
Usually, HTML elements belong to two groups,

00:00:10.185 --> 00:00:12.685
either block or inline.

00:00:12.685 --> 00:00:15.810
A block level element begins on a new line

00:00:15.810 --> 00:00:19.560
in the webpage and takes up the full available width.

00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:23.610
An example of this is the P element to display text.

00:00:23.610 --> 00:00:28.860
As you can see here, it stretches out to the full width of the available space.

00:00:28.860 --> 00:00:32.685
A div element is also a block level element too,

00:00:32.685 --> 00:00:35.900
along with many more which we'll take a look at soon.

00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:37.765
Next up is inline.

00:00:37.765 --> 00:00:42.005
An example of an inline element is the image element.

00:00:42.005 --> 00:00:45.875
Inline elements do not start on a new line therefore,

00:00:45.875 --> 00:00:49.450
can be placed alongside each other, like you can see here.

00:00:49.450 --> 00:00:53.570
They can also be placed inside a block-level element too.

00:00:53.570 --> 00:00:57.850
This is how we often do things when using a surrounding div.

00:00:57.850 --> 00:01:00.300
The div element is block level,

00:01:00.300 --> 00:01:05.090
and this can contain both block and inline elements inside of it.

00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:08.090
If we go over to the Mozilla website,

00:01:08.090 --> 00:01:12.320
we can see a list of block and inline elements at the bottom.

00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:19.635
Scrolling down to the list of block level elements we can see the footer, the form,

00:01:19.635 --> 00:01:25.715
aside, article, paragraph tags and tables to name a few,

00:01:25.715 --> 00:01:27.440
are all block level elements.

00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:30.715
Therefore, starting on a new line by defaults.

00:01:30.715 --> 00:01:33.150
Then we have the inline elements.

00:01:33.150 --> 00:01:38.110
Again, we can scroll down to the bottom and see the inline elements as a list.

00:01:38.110 --> 00:01:41.660
This is things such as buttons,

00:01:41.660 --> 00:01:44.720
inputs, em, and also image,

00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:46.345
as we just looked at before.

00:01:46.345 --> 00:01:50.465
These links are available in the resources if you want to take a closer look.

00:01:50.465 --> 00:01:54.605
Block and inline is a traditional way of categorizing an element.

00:01:54.605 --> 00:02:00.370
In HTML5, there are a few more categories available such as flow and phrasing.

00:02:00.370 --> 00:02:04.340
These, however, have a lot more complex rules and definitions,

00:02:04.340 --> 00:02:09.380
so maybe only way of diving into once you become really comfortable with HTML.

00:02:09.380 --> 00:02:14.095
Of course, there are also links to this in the resources if you want to check this out.

00:02:14.095 --> 00:02:17.300
But understanding the difference between block and

00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:21.055
inline is really important when working with HTML.

00:02:21.055 --> 00:02:25.115
It will help you better lay out your content and also help

00:02:25.115 --> 00:02:29.760
understand why things are being placed in a page in a certain way.
