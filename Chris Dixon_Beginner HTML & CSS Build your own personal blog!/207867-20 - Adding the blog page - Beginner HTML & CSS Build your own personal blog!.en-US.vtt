00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.255
With the London page now completed,

00:00:03.255 --> 00:00:06.345
now let's move on to creating the blog page.

00:00:06.345 --> 00:00:08.430
A lot of the basic structure,

00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.065
such as the head section,

00:00:10.065 --> 00:00:12.930
is similar across all the website.

00:00:12.930 --> 00:00:16.305
We will also be reusing the same habitue.

00:00:16.305 --> 00:00:23.265
This means we can duplicate or copy and paste the existing index page to get us started.

00:00:23.265 --> 00:00:27.130
Let's do that over in our text editor.

00:00:27.290 --> 00:00:31.180
I'm going to Command or Control C,

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:36.825
and then Command V to copy and paste this index page,

00:00:36.825 --> 00:00:39.435
and then we want to rename this file,

00:00:39.435 --> 00:00:42.250
the blog dot HTML.

00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:47.380
Remember too, as we build this blog page although I've

00:00:47.380 --> 00:00:50.980
shown you techniques to use while applying them to my site,

00:00:50.980 --> 00:00:54.995
feel free to customize them if you wish to save your project.

00:00:54.995 --> 00:00:57.285
Now we have two HTML pages,

00:00:57.285 --> 00:01:00.385
we have our index page for the London page,

00:01:00.385 --> 00:01:02.140
and then the blog page,

00:01:02.140 --> 00:01:03.805
which we're going to link to.

00:01:03.805 --> 00:01:09.660
In fact, all the HTML code we have for the London page will also apply to the blog.

00:01:09.660 --> 00:01:16.480
If we take a look at the finished version and then select the blog,

00:01:16.550 --> 00:01:22.810
the page is just the same as the London page with a blog just added below at the bottom.

00:01:22.810 --> 00:01:25.880
The image is not the full size of the screen either,

00:01:25.880 --> 00:01:28.960
but this is something we can fix in the CSS.

00:01:28.960 --> 00:01:33.020
Let's go back over to the blog dot HTML.

00:01:33.020 --> 00:01:34.610
If you remember from before,

00:01:34.610 --> 00:01:39.440
we also have the link to this blog dot HTML page already in place,

00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:43.865
this means we should now be able to click on the link in the browser to see the blog.

00:01:43.865 --> 00:01:46.480
Select a blog at the top,

00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:48.650
and although this is the same page,

00:01:48.650 --> 00:01:52.835
we can see that this is now selected the blog dot HTML.

00:01:52.835 --> 00:01:57.385
Here we can also see the benefits of switching to an external style sheets.

00:01:57.385 --> 00:02:01.775
We now have two HTML pages sharing the same styles.

00:02:01.775 --> 00:02:07.020
Next up we will start to create some articles to display the blog posts.
