00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.090
During this course, we'll be building our project and learning about HTML and CSS.

00:00:06.090 --> 00:00:09.300
What exactly is HTML and CSS?

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.640
Well, we start with HTML.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:15.090
HTML stands for hypertext markup

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:21.345
language.HTML is the standard markup language for creating websites and applications.

00:00:21.345 --> 00:00:28.020
Currently, the latest version is HTML5 and in each version which gets introduced,

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.520
there's new features added.

00:00:29.520 --> 00:00:32.385
We'll talk about these as well for the course.

00:00:32.385 --> 00:00:36.285
HTML elements are the building blocks of a webpage.

00:00:36.285 --> 00:00:42.445
Most elements consist of a opening and closing tag with some content in between.

00:00:42.445 --> 00:00:45.890
So this example at the bottom is a p tag,

00:00:45.890 --> 00:00:49.070
and this is used for adding paragraphs of text.

00:00:49.070 --> 00:00:52.100
We have the opening tag on the left and then

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:55.240
a closing tag on the right with the forward slash.

00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:57.810
Then we place some content in between.

00:00:57.810 --> 00:01:00.975
For this example, it is just simply some text.

00:01:00.975 --> 00:01:03.440
We can also add some attributes to

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:07.930
these HTML elements and it provides some additional information.

00:01:07.930 --> 00:01:11.030
We add these attributes to the opening tag.

00:01:11.030 --> 00:01:13.535
So we can see with the example at the bottom,

00:01:13.535 --> 00:01:16.880
we've added a ID attributes to this paragraph of

00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.835
text and then gave his ID a name of header text.

00:01:21.835 --> 00:01:24.525
We can then use this name of header text.

00:01:24.525 --> 00:01:29.690
Later on to add some CSS or even work with it using JavaScript.

00:01:29.690 --> 00:01:32.255
Next up we have CSS.

00:01:32.255 --> 00:01:35.515
CSS stands for cascading style sheets.

00:01:35.515 --> 00:01:39.860
It is a stylesheet language used for describing the look and

00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:46.030
also the formatting of a web document written in a markup language, such as HTML.

00:01:46.030 --> 00:01:50.585
CSS is used for styling, positioning, and layout.

00:01:50.585 --> 00:01:53.135
CSS3 is the latest version,

00:01:53.135 --> 00:01:55.220
which includes lots of new features,

00:01:55.220 --> 00:02:00.100
such as adding transformations and animations, to name a few.

00:02:00.100 --> 00:02:02.180
So as we go through the course,

00:02:02.180 --> 00:02:05.090
we'll learn lots more about HTML and CSS,

00:02:05.090 --> 00:02:09.410
but for now, just remember that HTML provides the content of the web page.

00:02:09.410 --> 00:02:13.080
Then we use CSS for any styling and layout.
