00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.570
If you're new to build a website,

00:00:03.570 --> 00:00:08.280
it can be common to think a technical subject like this will

00:00:08.280 --> 00:00:13.290
need a super powerful computer and lots of tools or software.

00:00:13.290 --> 00:00:15.480
This is not the case, however,

00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.295
as long as your computer can run a program such as Word,

00:00:20.295 --> 00:00:24.150
and also browse the Internet, you are good to go.

00:00:24.150 --> 00:00:26.445
To follow along with this course,

00:00:26.445 --> 00:00:28.995
there are only two main things you will need,

00:00:28.995 --> 00:00:32.715
and they are both free to use and download.

00:00:32.715 --> 00:00:37.740
First is something which you probably already have if you're watching this course,

00:00:37.740 --> 00:00:39.865
and this is a web browser.

00:00:39.865 --> 00:00:45.320
I'll be using Google Chrome for this course and it's also the one I would recommend.

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:50.605
We will look at the Chrome developer tools later on in this course too.

00:00:50.605 --> 00:00:53.585
If you have any of the other main web browser,

00:00:53.585 --> 00:00:55.880
such as Firefox, Safari,

00:00:55.880 --> 00:00:59.120
Internet Explorer, or the newer Microsoft Edge,

00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:01.705
this is completely fine to use too.

00:01:01.705 --> 00:01:07.580
You may want to download more than one to test your website in different browsers.

00:01:07.580 --> 00:01:10.140
Next up is a text editor.

00:01:10.140 --> 00:01:12.950
This is a place where you will write your code.

00:01:12.950 --> 00:01:16.700
Here, you can see some popular text editors available,

00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:18.925
and also the links to each.

00:01:18.925 --> 00:01:22.020
First of all, there's Visual Studio Code,

00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:27.110
which I will be using, and it's also available for Mac, Windows, or Linux.

00:01:27.110 --> 00:01:29.830
It's free to download and use.

00:01:29.830 --> 00:01:33.575
Atom is also popular and is built by GitHub.

00:01:33.575 --> 00:01:37.205
It has a good back-in. It's available for Mac,

00:01:37.205 --> 00:01:40.870
Windows, and Linux, and also free to use.

00:01:40.870 --> 00:01:47.425
Sublime Text has also been popular for a long time and is a great web text editor.

00:01:47.425 --> 00:01:52.245
This is the only one here where there is a cost to purchase a license.

00:01:52.245 --> 00:01:56.070
However, it is free to download and also to evaluate.

00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:00.470
Currently, there is no time limits on the evaluation period.

00:02:00.470 --> 00:02:04.995
Again, it is available for Mac, Windows, and Linux.

00:02:04.995 --> 00:02:09.720
Bracket is also popular too and has a good life preview,

00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:13.660
meaning the changes as shown in the browser as you type,

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:16.000
without having to refresh the page.

00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.175
This is also available for Mac,

00:02:18.175 --> 00:02:20.230
Windows, and Linux too.

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:25.410
You can actually write a website with any text program, such as Word,

00:02:25.410 --> 00:02:30.145
but there are many benefits to using a dedicated editor for the web,

00:02:30.145 --> 00:02:33.925
such as color-coding, arrow highlighting,

00:02:33.925 --> 00:02:36.995
and auto completion, to name a few.

00:02:36.995 --> 00:02:42.315
As I said before, I'll be using the first one here called Visual Studio Code.

00:02:42.315 --> 00:02:48.045
Head over to there or another of your choice and download the software for your platform.

00:02:48.045 --> 00:02:51.650
Once this is done, come back in the next video and we'd

00:02:51.650 --> 00:02:56.010
take a closer look at what is HTML and CSS.
