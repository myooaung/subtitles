00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.890
In this video, I'm going to concentrate on creating the blog posts.

00:00:04.890 --> 00:00:07.725
As you can see here on the final site,

00:00:07.725 --> 00:00:09.360
if we resize the browser,

00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:13.530
we see the layout switch for small screens to full width.

00:00:13.530 --> 00:00:17.250
We already know we can achieve this using flex-box.

00:00:17.250 --> 00:00:20.370
To do this, I'm going to create div elements with the class of

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:24.870
rubber to surround both the blog and also the sidebar.

00:00:24.870 --> 00:00:29.610
We can then set the state to be the flex parents and switch the content from

00:00:29.610 --> 00:00:34.865
column to row on different size devices. Let's set this up now.

00:00:34.865 --> 00:00:38.310
Let's go over to the blog dot HTML and then

00:00:38.310 --> 00:00:42.780
go just below this div with the class of journey image.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:45.880
I'm going to create a new div.

00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:54.220
The opening and closing tags and then give us a class of wrappers.

00:00:58.140 --> 00:01:01.720
Then we're going to have two sections within this,

00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.175
it's going to be a main section which is going to surround the blog posts.

00:01:06.175 --> 00:01:08.525
Then it's going to be a side section,

00:01:08.525 --> 00:01:10.735
which is going to be for the sidebar.

00:01:10.735 --> 00:01:13.690
Let's create these two sections now.

00:01:13.690 --> 00:01:17.300
First up we have the main section.

00:01:20.930 --> 00:01:26.050
Then just below this we have the side section.

00:01:31.940 --> 00:01:36.580
Add these both in and make sure they are nested inside the div with

00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:40.735
the class of wrapper main on the side along with article,

00:01:40.735 --> 00:01:46.120
which we'll use next for all semantic HTML elements which we looked at earlier.

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.590
Now we can add the article to be the container for the blog posts.

00:01:50.590 --> 00:01:55.550
All the blog posts which we create will be within this main section.

00:01:55.890 --> 00:01:59.060
Let's add our article.

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:07.270
Also, I'm going to reuse the class of background to give

00:02:07.270 --> 00:02:11.705
the blog post the same consistent gray background as we've already used.

00:02:11.705 --> 00:02:15.030
Let's add this class of backgrounds.

00:02:17.030 --> 00:02:19.490
Now it's just a case of building up

00:02:19.490 --> 00:02:22.745
this blog post with elements which we've already used.

00:02:22.745 --> 00:02:25.410
Let's start with the header.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:31.205
The header section is going to include information such as the name of the blog post,

00:02:31.205 --> 00:02:35.370
also some information about the author and tags.

00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:39.070
Let's add the header at the top.

00:02:39.070 --> 00:02:43.420
Next, within here I'm going to add a h 2.

00:02:44.650 --> 00:02:51.000
This is going to be slightly smaller than the main title of the top of the page.

00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:56.450
This is going to be the name of the blog post, as you can see here.

00:02:58.490 --> 00:03:03.320
As an example, I'm just going to call this the blog post 1,

00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.150
and then I'm going to create an unordered list to then create

00:03:10.150 --> 00:03:14.560
the information about the blog post such as the database created,

00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:17.390
the tags, and also the offer.

00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.505
Just below the level 2 heading,

00:03:21.505 --> 00:03:24.260
let's add the unordered list.

00:03:26.040 --> 00:03:29.570
Along with some list items,

00:03:34.830 --> 00:03:37.900
we're going to begin to offer.

00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.100
Then I'm going to use the em tags to add some extra emphasis to the author's name.

00:03:44.710 --> 00:03:48.690
Between em, I'm going to add my name.

00:03:50.020 --> 00:03:53.300
Let's give it a save and see how it is looking.

00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:55.775
If we go back to the project,

00:03:55.775 --> 00:03:59.140
select the blog, and then scroll down.

00:03:59.140 --> 00:04:05.200
Now we have the author shown at the bottom as well as the title of the blog post.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:08.330
All I want to do now is just simply copy,

00:04:08.330 --> 00:04:12.800
this list item and paste it in two more times.

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.650
The second one is going to be for the tags.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:21.860
I'm going to add just a few tags inside here.

00:04:29.140 --> 00:04:34.580
That's fine and then the third and final one is going to be created date.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:37.120
Let's just add five days ago as

00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:42.530
an example and give that a save and see how this is looking.

00:04:42.570 --> 00:04:46.035
I'm going to set all the header information,

00:04:46.035 --> 00:04:47.795
outside this header section,

00:04:47.795 --> 00:04:49.730
but still within the article.

00:04:49.730 --> 00:04:53.070
I'm now going to create a new section.

00:04:56.210 --> 00:05:00.240
This is going to be for all the rest of the blog information,

00:05:00.240 --> 00:05:03.825
such as the image and also the text.

00:05:03.825 --> 00:05:09.380
Before we've looked at adding an image via the CSS background property.

00:05:09.380 --> 00:05:14.040
We can also add images using the HTML image tag.

00:05:15.310 --> 00:05:18.035
This is a self-closing tag,

00:05:18.035 --> 00:05:20.390
meaning there is no closing tag to it.

00:05:20.390 --> 00:05:24.530
So all we need to do is add the image elements and then add a source.

00:05:24.530 --> 00:05:28.115
The source is going to be the location of the image.

00:05:28.115 --> 00:05:33.500
Remember from before that we added all the images inside an images folder,

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.485
select the images folder,

00:05:36.485 --> 00:05:41.810
and then I want to start with the Venice.JPG image.

00:05:41.810 --> 00:05:45.305
If you're not using the images provided with this course,

00:05:45.305 --> 00:05:47.135
now would be a good time to go and grab

00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:52.445
4-5 different images and place them inside your images folder.

00:05:52.445 --> 00:05:59.950
I'm also going to add an ALT attribute of Venice image.

00:06:00.650 --> 00:06:05.150
This is basically a fallback for if the image can be displayed.

00:06:05.150 --> 00:06:07.840
It's also read by screen readers too.

00:06:07.840 --> 00:06:09.830
It's usually recommended to put

00:06:09.830 --> 00:06:13.600
this alternative text in in case the image can't be displayed.

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.750
Below this you want to add the text for the block within the p-type.

00:06:21.190 --> 00:06:25.295
Of course, feel free to write out a blog post if you want.

00:06:25.295 --> 00:06:27.550
But I'm just going to add some sample text,

00:06:27.550 --> 00:06:32.430
and we can do this by visiting a site called Lorem Ipsum.

00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:41.905
I just do a search for Lorem Ipsum and then select lipsum.com.

00:06:41.905 --> 00:06:47.480
This will give us some sample or dummy text which we can use on the website.

00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:52.400
All we need to do is go down and select as many paragraphs as we want.

00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:57.535
I'm just going to change this to two paragraphs and then click generate.

00:06:57.535 --> 00:07:04.130
Then this gives us some sample text which we can copy and use within our project.

00:07:04.130 --> 00:07:13.545
Paste this in right between the p tags and give a save.

00:07:13.545 --> 00:07:16.300
Let's see how this is looking now.

00:07:16.420 --> 00:07:20.380
If we go back over to the blog and refresh.

00:07:20.380 --> 00:07:26.750
Great. As well as the header we'll also have the image and also the sample text below.

00:07:26.750 --> 00:07:31.700
The last thing we want to do is add a link to the Read More section.

00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:34.890
As you can see on the finished site here.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:40.380
Just below the sample text and create a little bit of space here.

00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:45.450
I want to use A tags because this is going to be

00:07:45.450 --> 00:07:50.240
a link with the href and I'm just going to keep this empty for now.

00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:53.900
This will be useful to link to the full blog posts on

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:58.440
its own separate page and then the closing a tag.

00:07:59.170 --> 00:08:02.700
The text of Read more.

00:08:04.730 --> 00:08:09.360
Let's take a look at this now in the browser, refresh.

00:08:09.910 --> 00:08:13.720
Never goes now will have the link at the bottom.

00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:16.220
This article now in place,

00:08:16.220 --> 00:08:20.885
I'm just going to simply copy and paste this in a few more times.

00:08:20.885 --> 00:08:23.540
Copy the full article,

00:08:23.540 --> 00:08:26.380
then paste it in one more time.

00:08:26.380 --> 00:08:30.680
I'm just going to change to blog posts 2 and also change

00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:35.740
the image from Venice to hike.JPEG.

00:08:36.040 --> 00:08:41.200
Then browse article make some space and paste in again,

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:43.655
so blog post free.

00:08:43.655 --> 00:08:47.100
This time the image is going to be lake.

00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:50.840
Let's say that I'm going to do this one more time.

00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:55.290
It's great for articles paste it in and change this to be blog

00:08:55.290 --> 00:09:00.810
post 4 and the final image I'm going to use is the elephant.

00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:07.655
Save that and add your images in and then go to the browser once that's done,

00:09:07.655 --> 00:09:09.925
and check this for blog posts.

00:09:09.925 --> 00:09:13.040
So the first one, second one,

00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:15.855
the third, and also the fourth,

00:09:15.855 --> 00:09:18.480
each with their own unique image.

00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:21.680
Now we can see the four blog posts in place.

00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:25.865
The styling needs a little work and the layout will not yet be responsive.

00:09:25.865 --> 00:09:29.880
But this is fine, for now we'll fix this in a later video.
