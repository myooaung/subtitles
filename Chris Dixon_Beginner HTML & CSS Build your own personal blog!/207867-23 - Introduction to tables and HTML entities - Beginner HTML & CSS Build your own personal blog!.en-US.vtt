00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:04.050
Taking a look at this finished version of my site,

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:09.300
I'm now going to add the sidebar widgets with the countries to visit.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.820
This is a widget would suit my blog.

00:00:11.820 --> 00:00:14.655
You can of course choose soon finance if you prefer.

00:00:14.655 --> 00:00:16.800
However, the techniques which we'll cover in

00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:20.130
this video are useful fundamentals to know of.

00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:25.395
The layout of the widget will be created with a HTML table.

00:00:25.395 --> 00:00:30.090
Tables used to be used a long time ago for laying our websites.

00:00:30.090 --> 00:00:34.380
This was before CSS took over for layout positioning.

00:00:34.380 --> 00:00:36.990
Also long before the flexbox,

00:00:36.990 --> 00:00:38.680
which we're now using.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:42.575
Using tables for layout is now considered bad practice.

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.970
However, it is still useful for laying out data such as our list of

00:00:46.970 --> 00:00:52.085
countries or even something such as a table of scores or results.

00:00:52.085 --> 00:00:56.195
To begin, let's add our sidebar section,

00:00:56.195 --> 00:00:59.970
just below the social media section.

00:01:00.070 --> 00:01:02.690
Add a new section inside

00:01:02.690 --> 00:01:10.850
here and then inside

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:13.990
the opening tag we can add some classes.

00:01:13.990 --> 00:01:20.130
Just like before I'm going to use is consistent sidebar widgets on background.

00:01:25.940 --> 00:01:29.900
We'll go on to use knees later on in the course.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:41.550
Inside the section, we can then add a table with the table elements.

00:01:45.220 --> 00:01:48.785
This also has an opening and closing tag.

00:01:48.785 --> 00:01:52.040
Within here we can start to create our table.

00:01:52.040 --> 00:01:55.670
Inside here we could add some table headings.

00:01:55.670 --> 00:01:58.235
For example, in a table of users,

00:01:58.235 --> 00:02:00.275
this will be the top row in bold,

00:02:00.275 --> 00:02:01.550
which are the first name,

00:02:01.550 --> 00:02:06.320
a last name, and an email for example, at the top of each column.

00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:09.600
Let's create this header with the thead.

00:02:16.690 --> 00:02:20.345
Within here we use the tr elements.

00:02:20.345 --> 00:02:23.395
Tr is used to create a new row,

00:02:23.395 --> 00:02:28.250
we can use more than one row by only need the title of countries to visit.

00:02:28.250 --> 00:02:31.770
I'm just going to keep this as one row.

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:37.125
Then next to it inside here,

00:02:37.125 --> 00:02:39.850
you see th elements.

00:02:41.680 --> 00:02:45.005
This is used for the header data.

00:02:45.005 --> 00:02:48.230
Opening and closing tag and that within here

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.455
we can ask the text that we want to add as the heading.

00:02:51.455 --> 00:02:55.505
I'm also going to places within a h2 psych inside,

00:02:55.505 --> 00:03:00.710
just to keep the name consistent with the over social media widget.

00:03:00.710 --> 00:03:06.690
Let's add to the h2 in here with the text of countries to visit.

00:03:10.430 --> 00:03:15.320
Then just after this table head section below here,

00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:19.920
we can also add the table body with tbody.

00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:27.950
If you're struggling to remember all these tags, don't worry.

00:03:27.950 --> 00:03:30.860
There's a head section and also a body section,

00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.305
just like we've already used in his website,

00:03:33.305 --> 00:03:38.400
where we have the head section at the top and then the body section just below.

00:03:38.510 --> 00:03:41.615
Scroll them back down to the table.

00:03:41.615 --> 00:03:45.590
We can then start to add some data to this table body,

00:03:45.590 --> 00:03:48.955
such as the countries which want to visit.

00:03:48.955 --> 00:03:50.990
Just like this table header,

00:03:50.990 --> 00:03:53.915
the body data is placed inside rows two.

00:03:53.915 --> 00:03:57.450
We use the same tr for each row.

00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.660
Each cell inside of the row uses td,

00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:05.890
for the table data.

00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:14.930
Here we can start at our countries or whichever data you want to put in your table.

00:04:14.930 --> 00:04:19.260
I'm going to start with the country of Mexico.

00:04:19.870 --> 00:04:27.000
Then within the same row, I'm going to add a new td for some more table data.

00:04:27.270 --> 00:04:32.850
Then inside here, got to use the ampersand symbol,

00:04:32.850 --> 00:04:35.820
the harsh then one, zero, zero, zero,

00:04:35.820 --> 00:04:40.290
three, followed by the semicolon at the end.

00:04:40.430 --> 00:04:43.380
The first cell is for the country name.

00:04:43.380 --> 00:04:45.920
The second may look a little strange.

00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.165
This is what we call a HTML entity.

00:04:49.165 --> 00:04:53.255
HTML entities are used to display characters or symbols,

00:04:53.255 --> 00:04:56.335
just like the tick we see on the finished sites,

00:04:56.335 --> 00:04:58.950
just over here on the right.

00:04:58.950 --> 00:05:03.365
Also entities are used to replace certain symbols,

00:05:03.365 --> 00:05:10.300
such as the less than or the greater than symbol. Just like this.

00:05:10.850 --> 00:05:14.930
If we were to just uses less than or greater than symbol,

00:05:14.930 --> 00:05:18.545
the browser may think that this is the start of a HTML tag.

00:05:18.545 --> 00:05:21.000
This could cause problems.

00:05:21.170 --> 00:05:28.520
As an example, less than is replaced by ampersand lt,

00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:31.680
followed by a semicolon.

00:05:32.540 --> 00:05:35.810
Let's give that a save and then see this in the browser.

00:05:35.810 --> 00:05:39.260
If we refresh, go back down to the table,

00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:41.470
we can see that there's our tick,

00:05:41.470 --> 00:05:43.515
which is this code here.

00:05:43.515 --> 00:05:45.525
Then our less than symbol,

00:05:45.525 --> 00:05:47.755
we can see above just here.

00:05:47.755 --> 00:05:55.475
We can use a greater than symbol by replacing lt would gt then refresh.

00:05:55.475 --> 00:05:59.300
Now you can see that the symbol is now the greater than.

00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.110
Let's remove this.

00:06:02.110 --> 00:06:06.545
Also have access to many more Unicode symbols,

00:06:06.545 --> 00:06:11.010
by visiting a website called unicode-table.com.

00:06:16.930 --> 00:06:21.020
Here we can see a list of some of the popular characters which we can use.

00:06:21.020 --> 00:06:22.955
Or we can do a search to,

00:06:22.955 --> 00:06:25.310
and we need to do to add these in,

00:06:25.310 --> 00:06:31.030
is to select it and then copy the HTML code and add this to our project.

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:34.160
Now we can see the info on this first row.

00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:37.850
All I'm going to do now is copy and paste in some more rows.

00:06:37.850 --> 00:06:41.070
Copy the tr section.

00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:47.660
How many times you paste this in depends on the info you need for your theme,

00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:51.935
paste it in below and then change the country.

00:06:51.935 --> 00:06:55.260
The next one we're going to add is Egypt.

00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:58.155
Then we're going to keep going with the country's,

00:06:58.155 --> 00:07:00.880
next I'm going to add Spain,

00:07:08.450 --> 00:07:11.370
then China.

00:07:11.370 --> 00:07:19.280
I'm also going to remove the tick because I'm not been to China, paste it more,

00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.010
changes to Portugal,

00:07:28.490 --> 00:07:31.360
Dominical Republic,

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:52.040
and then Thailand. Of course add as many rows as you want for your blog.

00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:54.200
I should add one or two more in,

00:07:54.200 --> 00:07:57.419
after Thailand I'm going to France,

00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:02.340
and just a couple more, we'll add Canada.

00:08:06.310 --> 00:08:10.439
I want to remove the tick from Canada.

00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.350
Then finally the last row I'm going to add Australia.

00:08:21.040 --> 00:08:25.650
Give that a save, and then let's check this out in a browser.

00:08:25.730 --> 00:08:30.980
That's looking good. Now we can see our list of countries all on their own separate rows.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:34.820
We've also got the HTML entity as a tick.

00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:40.505
With this table now finished is now completes the A-side section for my blog.

00:08:40.505 --> 00:08:43.910
Also, this is the final HTML content now added.

00:08:43.910 --> 00:08:46.610
We can now move on to the next video.

00:08:46.610 --> 00:08:51.630
We will add some CSS styling along we'll look in at pseudo-classes.
