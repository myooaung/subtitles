00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.700
Your blog should now be shaping up really well.

00:00:02.700 --> 00:00:06.930
We have CSS styling now completed for mobile devices,

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:09.300
and it's now time to complete the CSS for

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:14.535
larger screens including a layout change inside of the media query.

00:00:14.535 --> 00:00:16.590
If you remember from the last video,

00:00:16.590 --> 00:00:19.470
we set the container or the wrapper to have

00:00:19.470 --> 00:00:23.430
the display type of flex and the flex direction of column,

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:26.310
which stacks all elements on top of each other.

00:00:26.310 --> 00:00:29.490
For larger screens, you want the blog posts and

00:00:29.490 --> 00:00:32.865
also the sidebar to have a flex direction of row.

00:00:32.865 --> 00:00:36.330
Let's do this inside of the media query.

00:00:36.330 --> 00:00:38.165
Just under the header nav,

00:00:38.165 --> 00:00:40.440
I'm going to add a comment.

00:00:40.440 --> 00:00:42.995
Remember from before that we mentioned that

00:00:42.995 --> 00:00:46.060
comments can be added to add notes to ourselves.

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:48.830
This is ignored by the web browser.

00:00:48.830 --> 00:00:51.020
So this is the blog section now.

00:00:51.020 --> 00:00:56.210
We're going to select the wrapper and change the flex direction

00:00:56.210 --> 00:01:01.590
to be row and then refresh.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:08.170
Now we can see instantly that the blog posts and the sidebar is now in a row.

00:01:08.210 --> 00:01:11.370
Now we're going to set the flex property.

00:01:11.370 --> 00:01:13.445
We're going to set the main section,

00:01:13.445 --> 00:01:14.850
which is this blog part,

00:01:14.850 --> 00:01:16.900
to have a flex value of three,

00:01:16.900 --> 00:01:20.165
and then the sidebar to a flex value of one.

00:01:20.165 --> 00:01:22.310
This means that the blog section will take up

00:01:22.310 --> 00:01:25.595
three times the available space of the sidebar.

00:01:25.595 --> 00:01:29.940
Let's do that now with the main selector.

00:01:29.940 --> 00:01:32.735
Remember this is the blog posts,

00:01:32.735 --> 00:01:35.600
the flex value of three,

00:01:35.600 --> 00:01:41.580
and then the side section can have the flex value of one.

00:01:42.530 --> 00:01:46.545
We'll save that, give it a refresh,

00:01:46.545 --> 00:01:49.690
and now you can see the size has changed.

00:01:49.690 --> 00:01:53.600
I'm going to add some margin to the left of the sidebar too

00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:58.410
just to create a bit of space between a sidebar and the blog posts,

00:01:58.420 --> 00:02:05.790
so margin-left of 15 pixels.

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:10.630
Okay. Good. That looks a lot better now.

00:02:10.640 --> 00:02:15.410
Now I'm going to add some CSS for the blog post header.

00:02:15.410 --> 00:02:21.660
We can target this with article header.

00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:25.855
So therefore, this only applies to the header within the article.

00:02:25.855 --> 00:02:31.050
I'm going to use the flex box property of justifying content.

00:02:36.140 --> 00:02:40.240
This defines how we want the elements to be spaced out.

00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:43.570
One of the examples is space between.

00:02:43.570 --> 00:02:46.750
Save that and give it a refresh.

00:02:46.750 --> 00:02:53.665
Now we can see this adds space between the title and also the unordered list.

00:02:53.665 --> 00:02:57.350
We can also change this to space around.

00:03:00.650 --> 00:03:05.110
Let's take a look at this. Now we'll get equal space all around the elements.

00:03:05.110 --> 00:03:07.870
If there was more elements inside this header,

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:10.700
they would also be equally spaced too.

00:03:11.540 --> 00:03:14.670
Justify content does have some more options

00:03:14.670 --> 00:03:18.390
too and there are some links available inside the resources.

00:03:18.390 --> 00:03:20.960
Now that's my blog now finished,

00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.000
and I'm happy with how things are starting to look

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.895
for smaller screens and also larger screens.

00:03:25.895 --> 00:03:30.305
Let's just shrink down the browser and see the media query in action.

00:03:30.305 --> 00:03:32.390
Once we hit 1000 pixels,

00:03:32.390 --> 00:03:34.960
we do get a layout change, so that's great.

00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:40.250
I encourage you to keep working on your own CSS too and change things to suit you.

00:03:40.250 --> 00:03:41.900
Even play around with the size of

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:46.105
the media queries and the layouts if it works better for your content.

00:03:46.105 --> 00:03:48.500
Even with this blog now complete,

00:03:48.500 --> 00:03:52.610
I still want to cover a few things which are useful for you to know.

00:03:52.610 --> 00:03:56.190
I will cover these in the upcoming videos.
