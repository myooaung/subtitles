00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.125
We've all blogged now finished.

00:00:02.125 --> 00:00:04.510
I'm now going to take a little step back and coding,

00:00:04.510 --> 00:00:08.905
and cover some things which you may find useful during building the blog,

00:00:08.905 --> 00:00:12.085
we used a lot of HTML and CSS.

00:00:12.085 --> 00:00:15.655
One of the challenges of developing websites is the fact that

00:00:15.655 --> 00:00:19.535
different browsers can display our websites a little differently.

00:00:19.535 --> 00:00:22.915
It's always best to test your website on various browsers,

00:00:22.915 --> 00:00:25.000
such as Chrome, Safari,

00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.445
Firefox, and Internet explorer,

00:00:27.445 --> 00:00:31.795
along with smaller device browsers to check it looks good on the Mall.

00:00:31.795 --> 00:00:35.260
Also, another consideration is some users

00:00:35.260 --> 00:00:38.770
will be using different versions of the same browser.

00:00:38.770 --> 00:00:40.825
May have the latest version,

00:00:40.825 --> 00:00:43.185
while some will have an older version.

00:00:43.185 --> 00:00:48.350
There is a useful website available called caniuse.com.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:51.060
Let's head o to that.

00:00:54.680 --> 00:01:00.320
This website gives us information about browsers pause for different versions.

00:01:00.320 --> 00:01:04.650
For example, if we start by searching for flexbox,

00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:12.620
and scroll down, we can see under the browser sport that it's mostly green.

00:01:12.620 --> 00:01:16.460
For example, it's available in all versions of Chrome,

00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:18.580
and it's fully supported.

00:01:18.580 --> 00:01:22.655
The same for Firefox and the majority of browsers.

00:01:22.655 --> 00:01:29.615
Now let's take a look at grid. Search for grids.

00:01:29.615 --> 00:01:32.380
If we scroll down to the browser support,

00:01:32.380 --> 00:01:35.890
this CSS grid property is new within flexbox.

00:01:35.890 --> 00:01:41.695
Can see some red, which means on supported and some partial spots in different browsers.

00:01:41.695 --> 00:01:44.650
This means we should take a little bit more care when using

00:01:44.650 --> 00:01:48.565
it as somebody uses may not have full support for this.

00:01:48.565 --> 00:01:50.305
Inside of the browser.

00:01:50.305 --> 00:01:55.240
There are some tools, and workarounds available to help with browser spot.

00:01:55.240 --> 00:01:57.655
If this is something which interested in,

00:01:57.655 --> 00:02:01.175
there are some useful links in the resources to check out.

00:02:01.175 --> 00:02:03.610
It's worth checking out sites like this,

00:02:03.610 --> 00:02:08.750
along with testing on different browsers to improve the user experience.
