00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.295
We now have the main section completed with the blog post in place.

00:00:05.295 --> 00:00:09.960
Now, we want to move on to the sidebar and add some social media buttons.

00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:13.335
Social media buttons are not too difficult to apply.

00:00:13.335 --> 00:00:15.930
The are certain websites which allows us to use

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:19.770
social media icons in our site free of charge,

00:00:19.770 --> 00:00:23.985
such as Font Awesome which I'm going to use on this site.

00:00:23.985 --> 00:00:27.840
Let's start by creating a new section for the sidebar.

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:31.455
Let's go over to the blog.html.

00:00:31.455 --> 00:00:35.175
We'll close this sidebar to give us some more space.

00:00:35.175 --> 00:00:40.395
Remember from before, we've already created the side section for the sidebar.

00:00:40.395 --> 00:00:44.230
All we need to do is add a new section.

00:00:48.140 --> 00:00:51.035
Then within the opening tag of the section,

00:00:51.035 --> 00:00:52.970
I'm going to add some classes.

00:00:52.970 --> 00:00:57.690
First of all, I'm going to add one called sidebar widgets.

00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.355
This will allow us to style it with the CSS soon,

00:01:01.355 --> 00:01:07.025
and also the background class to keep the background color consistent across the site.

00:01:07.025 --> 00:01:12.060
Then I'm going to add a heading using the h2 tags.

00:01:15.980 --> 00:01:19.605
Then a text of follow me on.

00:01:19.605 --> 00:01:23.425
Then we can add our social media icons below.

00:01:23.425 --> 00:01:27.230
I'm going to add a new element called the hr.

00:01:27.230 --> 00:01:29.620
This is for a horizontal line,

00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:33.440
which we can see if we go to the browser and then refresh.

00:01:33.440 --> 00:01:36.085
Let's go up to the sidebar.

00:01:36.085 --> 00:01:40.130
In fact, it was down at the bottom because we haven't added any layout yet.

00:01:40.130 --> 00:01:45.005
We'll see the text of follow me on and also the line across the bottom.

00:01:45.005 --> 00:01:49.885
This will separate the text from the icons once you put them in place.

00:01:49.885 --> 00:01:53.165
As I mentioned before, I'll be using a site called

00:01:53.165 --> 00:01:57.395
Font Awesome to provide the social media icons.

00:01:57.395 --> 00:01:59.300
We can find these by visiting

00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:08.475
fontawesome.io then to get started.

00:02:08.475 --> 00:02:13.940
We click on the Get Started icon at the top and then scroll down.

00:02:13.940 --> 00:02:17.089
If you go down to Download & Customize,

00:02:17.089 --> 00:02:19.760
click on the Download button.

00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:24.480
There is a paid version too but all we need to do is click on no thanks.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.280
Just download Font Awesome 4,

00:02:28.930 --> 00:02:32.810
that should only take a moment to download.

00:02:32.810 --> 00:02:42.100
Once this is done, we can go to the downloads and then unzip the Font Awesome package.

00:02:44.390 --> 00:02:51.080
This one place on the desktop for now then rename this simply Font Awesome.

00:02:51.080 --> 00:02:53.345
Remove the version number.

00:02:53.345 --> 00:02:56.435
Then if we go into our travel blog projects,

00:02:56.435 --> 00:03:01.870
we can place this inside of the CSS folder just like that.

00:03:01.870 --> 00:03:04.910
This is because this is just a style sheet

00:03:04.910 --> 00:03:08.885
like we've already added for our own custom styles.

00:03:08.885 --> 00:03:13.265
Let's add this just like before inside the head section.

00:03:13.265 --> 00:03:16.375
Let's open up the project again.

00:03:16.375 --> 00:03:24.210
Go back up to the head section and add these just above the custom stylesheets.

00:03:24.430 --> 00:03:27.510
Let's add the link,

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:32.050
rel attribute of stylesheets.

00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:44.105
Then the href to link to the file the file is inside the CSS folder.

00:03:44.105 --> 00:03:45.950
Then within the CSS folder,

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:51.885
we have the folder of Font Awesome so forward slash.

00:03:51.885 --> 00:03:55.865
This also has its own CSS folder within it.

00:03:55.865 --> 00:03:58.714
We can see that by selecting the CSS,

00:03:58.714 --> 00:04:03.990
Font Awesome, and then as a secondary CSS folder inside there.

00:04:07.370 --> 00:04:14.080
Then the name of the file that we want to link to is fontawesome.min.css.

00:04:22.310 --> 00:04:27.165
The order of linking these stylesheets is also important too.

00:04:27.165 --> 00:04:31.295
We always want our own custom stylesheets at the very bottom.

00:04:31.295 --> 00:04:35.650
This makes sure our own styles we add are added last.

00:04:35.650 --> 00:04:40.535
Therefore, it will override any of the other styles from the stylesheets above.

00:04:40.535 --> 00:04:43.670
Now we have the icons added to our project.

00:04:43.670 --> 00:04:47.225
Let's go back to Font Awesome and see how to use them.

00:04:47.225 --> 00:04:51.180
Back over to fontawesome.io.

00:04:51.980 --> 00:04:54.405
We should get rid of that.

00:04:54.405 --> 00:04:57.685
Then if we go up to the icons,

00:04:57.685 --> 00:05:01.460
we can do a search for any of the available icons.

00:05:01.460 --> 00:05:05.250
For example, let's search for Facebook.

00:05:05.710 --> 00:05:09.835
We can see the search results appear at the bottom.

00:05:09.835 --> 00:05:13.960
I'm going to use the Facebook official, click on that.

00:05:13.960 --> 00:05:18.335
Then if you scroll down, we can see a HTML element which we can use.

00:05:18.335 --> 00:05:23.070
Copy this i element and then back over to the blog.html.

00:05:23.070 --> 00:05:26.170
If we go down to the aside section.

00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:30.520
Then just below the horizontal rule,

00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:38.390
I'm going to add a div this time with a class of social.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:41.820
We can use this in the CSS.

00:05:41.820 --> 00:05:48.200
Close of the div. Then all we need to do is paste in the new elements.

00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:53.820
Save that. Let's check this is working okay by refreshing.

00:05:53.820 --> 00:05:57.530
You can just about see the Facebook icon down at the bottom.

00:05:57.530 --> 00:06:01.130
I want to paste this in three more times.

00:06:01.130 --> 00:06:05.490
The second one is going to be fa-instagram.

00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.575
You can do a search on the Font Awesome website for any of these links.

00:06:11.575 --> 00:06:14.830
The next one I'm going to use twitter-square.

00:06:21.590 --> 00:06:25.720
Then finally the pinterest-square.

00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.845
Check we've spelled all these right by refreshing the browser.

00:06:33.845 --> 00:06:36.965
Great, so now we can see the four icons at the bottom.

00:06:36.965 --> 00:06:38.690
They are quite small at the minute,

00:06:38.690 --> 00:06:42.845
but we can make these a little bit bigger with a Font Awesome class

00:06:42.845 --> 00:06:51.540
of fa-2x which I'm going to paste this in all four of the links.

00:06:52.430 --> 00:06:56.920
This makes icons twice the size they would normally be.

00:06:57.260 --> 00:07:03.320
It looks a lot better now. I've placed these icons in the sidebar.

00:07:03.320 --> 00:07:06.665
I'm not going to link to any of my social media sites.

00:07:06.665 --> 00:07:10.490
You can go ahead and do this by surrounding the i element with

00:07:10.490 --> 00:07:12.365
the a element and provide

00:07:12.365 --> 00:07:16.735
a link just like we're doing in the links in the header section above.

00:07:16.735 --> 00:07:21.240
You can then add a href attribute like we did in the header.

00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.240
The href attribute is just the same as we've used in any of the above nav links.

00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:28.415
However, it's a link externally.

00:07:28.415 --> 00:07:31.600
We do need to link to the full URL.

00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:34.890
Once you're done, make sure to give that a save.

00:07:34.890 --> 00:07:37.940
Now our blog page is coming along well.

00:07:37.940 --> 00:07:43.410
Next we'll finish off the HTML by adding the last sidebar widgets.
