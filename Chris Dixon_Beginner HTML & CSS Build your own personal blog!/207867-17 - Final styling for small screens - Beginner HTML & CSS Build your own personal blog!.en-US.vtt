00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.730
So now we can add some styling to the text too.

00:00:05.420 --> 00:00:09.300
We get this text, a class of journey text.

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:12.490
Let's add this to the CSS just below.

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:22.660
So let's begin by adding the text line of sensor.

00:00:23.900 --> 00:00:27.040
Makes a little bit smaller.

00:00:28.190 --> 00:00:37.095
Then want to increase the font size to be 2ems.

00:00:37.095 --> 00:00:40.450
Here we use an m as the font size.

00:00:40.450 --> 00:00:42.410
We can use fixed sizes too,

00:00:42.410 --> 00:00:46.075
such as pixels but em is scalable unit,

00:00:46.075 --> 00:00:48.975
one em is equal to the current font size.

00:00:48.975 --> 00:00:53.960
So sinister 2em makes it twice the size it would normally be.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.650
So let's take a look by refreshing and now you can see the text is a lot bigger.

00:00:59.650 --> 00:01:07.720
Then let's add some padding to the text and this time I want to add 1.5em,

00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:11.570
and this works just like the font size is to be

00:01:11.570 --> 00:01:15.395
1.5 times the padding, which would normally be.

00:01:15.395 --> 00:01:19.785
So now you can see we've got some space around the text.

00:01:19.785 --> 00:01:30.185
Finally the border-radius, and once that mind to be ten pixels.

00:01:30.185 --> 00:01:36.380
So if I refresh, this gives us a nice rounded edge on the outside of the container.

00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.710
So things start to look a little bit nicer.

00:01:39.710 --> 00:01:43.790
We also want to do something about these links to the color does

00:01:43.790 --> 00:01:47.780
not fit in with the rest of the site and I want to remove the underlying too.

00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:49.340
If you remember these links,

00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:50.820
a set with the a tag.

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:54.010
So we target the selector in a CSS.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:58.005
So below the journey texts we can add the a.

00:01:58.005 --> 00:02:02.660
To remove the underline, we can set the text decoration to be

00:02:02.660 --> 00:02:09.190
known and this will remove the line from underneath each one of the links,

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:13.090
and then we can also set the color as we looked at before

00:02:13.090 --> 00:02:18.200
and what a much the rest of the site by sending this to the hex value of 1a1a1a,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.935
and then refresh and now this looks a lot more consistent with the rest of the sites.

00:02:25.935 --> 00:02:28.870
The last thing we want to do now in this video is to

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:32.125
make this gray background a little transparent,

00:02:32.125 --> 00:02:34.390
so the background can be seen through it.

00:02:34.390 --> 00:02:40.320
First, I'm going to go over to the CSS and up to the background property.

00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:43.475
I'm going to add a comment,

00:02:43.475 --> 00:02:46.060
which can be used with a forward slash,

00:02:46.060 --> 00:02:51.140
then star before, and then the opposite of a star and a forward slash,

00:02:51.140 --> 00:02:54.220
and then comment out this line.

00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:58.040
A Common is a way to tell a browser to ignore this code.

00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.980
We can also use comments to type in notes,

00:03:00.980 --> 00:03:04.510
both for ourselves and also for other developers.

00:03:04.510 --> 00:03:06.905
To add this see-through opacity,

00:03:06.905 --> 00:03:12.200
we can use an RGBA color in place of the hex type, which we just used.

00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:15.410
To convert this hex type colored to RGBA.

00:03:15.410 --> 00:03:17.675
We can use an online tool for this.

00:03:17.675 --> 00:03:25.920
So I'm going to go over to Google and make the browser a little bit bigger and want

00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:34.625
to search for hex to RGBA and its various tools you can use.

00:03:34.625 --> 00:03:38.160
I'm going to use the hex color tool.com.

00:03:39.770 --> 00:03:42.015
I don't need to enter a color.

00:03:42.015 --> 00:03:47.070
So the hex value which we used before was d8d8d8,

00:03:48.020 --> 00:03:52.490
and this will then convert it to an RGBA value.

00:03:52.490 --> 00:03:57.260
So copy this and go over to the backgrounds can

00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:01.880
paste this in to set the background to the new RGBA value,

00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:03.860
followed by the semicolon.

00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:07.160
RGBA colors have four values.

00:04:07.160 --> 00:04:09.590
We set the values of red,

00:04:09.590 --> 00:04:12.115
green, and blue to begin.

00:04:12.115 --> 00:04:18.060
Then the last value is for the transparency and this is a value between zero and one.

00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:20.730
Zero Being fully transparent.

00:04:20.730 --> 00:04:24.580
So I want to set mine to be no 0.7,

00:04:24.580 --> 00:04:28.440
gives us save and then refresh the browser.

00:04:30.110 --> 00:04:32.945
So now we can see behind the text we have

00:04:32.945 --> 00:04:37.100
the semitransparent backgrounds and the image starts to confirm.

00:04:37.100 --> 00:04:41.330
So we've now finished the styling for the small screen mobile view.

00:04:41.330 --> 00:04:44.690
Next, we're going to take a look at media queries to

00:04:44.690 --> 00:04:49.200
allow us to add styles to only apply on larger devices.
