00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
So far in our website we have added styles inside this head section,

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:06.480
between the style tags.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:12.630
This is known as an internal style sheet and is a way of styling one particular page.

00:00:12.630 --> 00:00:17.160
There is also another type we can use called external style sheets.

00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.175
The CSS will write it exactly the same,

00:00:20.175 --> 00:00:23.235
but will place it in its own separate file.

00:00:23.235 --> 00:00:26.190
This has a few benefits; first,

00:00:26.190 --> 00:00:29.280
it reduces the size of the HTML file.

00:00:29.280 --> 00:00:35.415
It also allows us to separate the HTML from the CSS for easy maintenance.

00:00:35.415 --> 00:00:40.560
Plus, we can also reuse the same styles across multiple pages.

00:00:40.560 --> 00:00:43.760
To add an external style sheets all we need to do is

00:00:43.760 --> 00:00:47.300
create a new file inside of our project.

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:50.270
Let's open up the project folder.

00:00:50.270 --> 00:00:52.175
This can be placed anywhere,

00:00:52.175 --> 00:00:54.695
but I'm going to add a CSS folder.

00:00:54.695 --> 00:00:58.700
This is handy if you want to add more style sheets later,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:03.085
so let's create a new folder called CSS.

00:01:03.085 --> 00:01:08.530
Then we can add our new CSS file inside a Visual Studio.

00:01:08.530 --> 00:01:11.950
We'll also open up the side bar and then we

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:16.470
click on the CSS folder and then click on new file.

00:01:16.510 --> 00:01:21.865
We're going to call this the style.CSS.

00:01:21.865 --> 00:01:27.550
The file name is up to us but it must have the dot CSS extension.

00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:33.845
Now include all the styles from the head section of our index page.

00:01:33.845 --> 00:01:37.820
From HTML, select all the styles,

00:01:37.820 --> 00:01:44.580
including the media query all the way down.

00:01:44.580 --> 00:01:52.780
So cut the styles out and then save that and paste it inside the new style. CSS file.

00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:57.380
Give that a Save and now if we go backwards to the index page,

00:01:57.380 --> 00:02:01.585
we don't need the style tags anymore, so we can remove them.

00:02:01.585 --> 00:02:04.845
One thing we do need is a new link.

00:02:04.845 --> 00:02:09.950
This link is going to link to our style sheet and it's similar to the one we have above,

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:12.870
the link to our Google fonts.

00:02:14.030 --> 00:02:16.845
Add this link in, it's just an opening tag,

00:02:16.845 --> 00:02:18.420
there's no closing tag,

00:02:18.420 --> 00:02:21.730
then at the rel attributes.

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.065
This specifies the relationship between the current documents and the linked documents.

00:02:27.065 --> 00:02:30.210
In this case, it's a style sheet.

00:02:31.970 --> 00:02:34.485
Then we add a second attribute,

00:02:34.485 --> 00:02:36.120
which is the href.

00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:39.455
The href is the location of our file,

00:02:39.455 --> 00:02:43.235
and it's the same attribute which we used in these links below.

00:02:43.235 --> 00:02:46.190
Because this is in the CSS folder,

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:48.810
we're going to add the css/style.css.

00:02:52.310 --> 00:02:56.070
Now if we save that and go over to the browser,

00:02:56.070 --> 00:02:59.470
we'll open up the project and then refresh.

00:02:59.470 --> 00:03:03.155
We can now see that the styles have still taken effect,

00:03:03.155 --> 00:03:05.570
but the background image is missing.

00:03:05.570 --> 00:03:08.720
If we go over to the style.css file,

00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:13.950
and then if we locate the background image, we can take a look why.

00:03:13.950 --> 00:03:17.335
It's all down to the image URL.

00:03:17.335 --> 00:03:22.115
The file path was fine before because the style was in the index page.

00:03:22.115 --> 00:03:25.690
This file path is relative to the file we're in,

00:03:25.690 --> 00:03:27.995
this means from the index page,

00:03:27.995 --> 00:03:31.915
we just needed to go into the images folder and the image was there for us.

00:03:31.915 --> 00:03:35.350
Now this style is inside of the css folder.

00:03:35.350 --> 00:03:40.380
We need to use the dot-dot slash in front of the file path.

00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:47.210
This dot-dot slash tells the browser to look up one level,

00:03:47.210 --> 00:03:48.830
meaning it will jump out of

00:03:48.830 --> 00:03:53.015
the CSS folder and into the root level where the index page is.

00:03:53.015 --> 00:03:55.625
Once we're back at the index page level,

00:03:55.625 --> 00:03:59.380
we can then go back into the images folder as before.

00:03:59.380 --> 00:04:01.485
Save that and refresh,

00:04:01.485 --> 00:04:04.250
we should now see that the background image is back in

00:04:04.250 --> 00:04:09.090
place and our external style sheet is now working.
