00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.660
Although we're learning a lot about HTML so far,

00:00:03.660 --> 00:00:07.905
websites don't really begin to look good until we add some styling,

00:00:07.905 --> 00:00:11.940
CSS styles can change our website appearance from something

00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:15.900
like we currently have here to then something like this,

00:00:15.900 --> 00:00:18.060
which is the finish site.

00:00:18.060 --> 00:00:19.965
One wave, I mean CSS,

00:00:19.965 --> 00:00:24.120
is to add style tags to the head section of our documents.

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.590
If open up the text editor and then go to the index.html.

00:00:29.590 --> 00:00:32.450
Go back up to the top head section,

00:00:32.450 --> 00:00:36.810
and then just below the title we can add the style elements.

00:00:38.710 --> 00:00:44.130
Just like this. This has the opening and also the closing tag.

00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:53.195
We can add any styling we want between these two tags.

00:00:53.195 --> 00:00:56.450
This way of doing things is called internal CSS.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:01:01.880
This is because the styles are only meant to be used internally on this page.

00:01:01.880 --> 00:01:05.765
Later we'll also cover an alternative way to do this.

00:01:05.765 --> 00:01:08.945
Then we need to choose which elements we want to style,

00:01:08.945 --> 00:01:10.655
by using a selector.

00:01:10.655 --> 00:01:14.420
A selector can be a name the of the elements which we've already used,

00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.560
such as header, p or li, for example.

00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:23.385
I'm going to begin by selecting the HTML,

00:01:23.385 --> 00:01:26.030
so add HTML there.

00:01:26.030 --> 00:01:28.610
Since HTML is a root element,

00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:32.485
all styles we add here will apply to the whole site.

00:01:32.485 --> 00:01:36.140
Any CSS styling rules for the selector needs to

00:01:36.140 --> 00:01:39.785
placed inside of a pair of curly braces, just like this.

00:01:39.785 --> 00:01:43.180
Since it's HTML selector applies to the whole page,

00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:47.540
a good use for this maybe to add the font which you want to use.

00:01:47.540 --> 00:01:49.970
To keep it consistent across the website,

00:01:49.970 --> 00:01:55.830
we can use the font-family property to set the font.

00:01:55.830 --> 00:02:01.655
You can see the text editor automatically gives some suggestions for us to use.

00:02:01.655 --> 00:02:07.915
I'm going to choose Arial as an example with the semicolon at the end.

00:02:07.915 --> 00:02:11.190
You will notice that it's three different names appearing,

00:02:11.190 --> 00:02:13.650
and this is the order of priority.

00:02:13.650 --> 00:02:15.660
First, we have Arial,

00:02:15.660 --> 00:02:20.290
and this is the font which we'll use if the browser supports it.

00:02:20.290 --> 00:02:23.505
If not, it will move on to Helvetica,

00:02:23.505 --> 00:02:25.680
which is the second priority.

00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:29.510
If neither Arial or Helvetica is available,

00:02:29.510 --> 00:02:32.030
the generic family name will be used,

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:35.370
such as serif or sans-serif.

00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:38.340
This is one way to add fonts,

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:43.010
another is by visiting a font website and selecting one from there.

00:02:43.010 --> 00:02:47.525
You can do a search for web-fonts if you want to take a closer look at some more,

00:02:47.525 --> 00:02:50.500
a popular one is Google fonts.

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:58.200
I'm going to go out to the web browser and then search for Google fonts,

00:03:01.100 --> 00:03:04.890
and this is the website which I'll be using for my blog.

00:03:04.890 --> 00:03:09.100
Let's go down to fonts.google.com.

00:03:09.970 --> 00:03:12.950
You can see some of the popular ones.

00:03:12.950 --> 00:03:16.745
You can do a search or also narrow down by category.

00:03:16.745 --> 00:03:20.030
The one I'm going to use for my blog is called quicksand.

00:03:20.030 --> 00:03:22.800
I'm going to do a search for this

00:03:23.530 --> 00:03:29.345
and then hit "Enter," and you can see the quicksand one appears in the search.

00:03:29.345 --> 00:03:33.235
Of course, feel free to choose a different one if you prefer.

00:03:33.235 --> 00:03:37.295
At this, we just need to click on the red plus symbol.

00:03:37.295 --> 00:03:39.155
Then to add this to our website,

00:03:39.155 --> 00:03:41.750
we go down to the bottom and expand.

00:03:41.750 --> 00:03:46.495
Then we have the link to the CSS style sheet.

00:03:46.495 --> 00:03:48.560
This is a link to Google fonts,

00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:51.125
which allows us to use this in our project.

00:03:51.125 --> 00:03:53.225
So copy this full link.

00:03:53.225 --> 00:04:00.370
I'm going to use Command or Control C to copy this and go back out to the index.html,

00:04:00.370 --> 00:04:03.940
and then we need to paste this inside the head section.

00:04:03.940 --> 00:04:09.390
I'm going to add this, just blow the title and paste that in.

00:04:10.430 --> 00:04:15.200
We need to do this because we're not using a standard web-font.

00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:19.270
We need to link to Google to make this available within our code,

00:04:19.270 --> 00:04:22.005
back over to Google fonts.

00:04:22.005 --> 00:04:25.610
We then need to copy the line of CSS,

00:04:25.610 --> 00:04:28.730
which is for the font-family which we've seen before.

00:04:28.730 --> 00:04:32.600
So copy this and then if we go into the style section,

00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.730
I'm going to replace the font-family,

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:38.680
which we used before and paste in this quicksand one.

00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.290
Now this non-standard font should work since we have the link above.

00:04:43.290 --> 00:04:46.875
Let's give that save and then refresh the browser,

00:04:46.875 --> 00:04:50.620
to go back out to the project and then refresh.

00:04:50.620 --> 00:04:54.180
Now we can see the style of text has changed.

00:04:54.180 --> 00:04:57.490
This means that the font is now working.

00:04:57.490 --> 00:05:00.935
Next, we can then change the font color.

00:05:00.935 --> 00:05:04.440
We simply add a color property to do this.

00:05:04.440 --> 00:05:07.205
Still within the HTML selector,

00:05:07.205 --> 00:05:08.780
going to add a new line,

00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:11.400
which is going to be for the color.

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:14.060
Again, as you type this out,

00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:16.640
you'll see some suggestions by the browser.

00:05:16.640 --> 00:05:19.535
You can pick any of these colors which you prefer,

00:05:19.535 --> 00:05:23.305
or you can use a color picker for a larger range of colors.

00:05:23.305 --> 00:05:28.100
If we go back over to the browser and then head out to Google,

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.920
I'm going to search for HTML color picker.

00:05:32.630 --> 00:05:36.240
A popular one is the W3Schools one,

00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:38.980
so I'm going to select that.

00:05:40.730 --> 00:05:44.180
Here we can select the color we like and also

00:05:44.180 --> 00:05:46.880
see lots of different shades and variants of this color.

00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.910
Just select one from the left-hand side,

00:05:49.910 --> 00:05:53.650
and then we can narrow it down to a lighter or darker shade.

00:05:53.650 --> 00:05:58.100
On the right, we're given the shades in what is called a hex format.

00:05:58.100 --> 00:06:00.545
This is what you can see on the right-hand side,

00:06:00.545 --> 00:06:03.829
and this is six digits with the hash prefix.

00:06:03.829 --> 00:06:07.325
We can then use this hex color within our CSS.

00:06:07.325 --> 00:06:12.090
I'm going to use a color value for my text of 1a1a1a.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:17.550
So let's go back over to the CSS and then with the hash prefix,

00:06:17.550 --> 00:06:24.460
I'm going to add 1a1a1a with the semicolon at the end.

00:06:24.460 --> 00:06:26.990
We need to make sure that each line ends with

00:06:26.990 --> 00:06:31.865
a semicolon and this is the case for all CSS properties.

00:06:31.865 --> 00:06:37.655
Give that a save and then if we refresh our project inside the browser,

00:06:37.655 --> 00:06:40.900
this should not change the color within the browser.

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.300
The change is very subtle,

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.520
so it may be difficult to tell.

00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:46.740
If you want to double-check this is working,

00:06:46.740 --> 00:06:49.085
we can change it to a different color,

00:06:49.085 --> 00:06:52.115
such as red and then refresh,

00:06:52.115 --> 00:06:55.555
and now we can see clearly that the text is changed.

00:06:55.555 --> 00:07:00.795
I'm just going to undo that change and then put it back to how it was.

00:07:00.795 --> 00:07:03.645
Well done if you've managed to get all this working.

00:07:03.645 --> 00:07:07.445
If not, check off your code carefully for any typing errors.

00:07:07.445 --> 00:07:13.200
Next up, I'll also want to show you how to use classes and IDs to select our elements.
