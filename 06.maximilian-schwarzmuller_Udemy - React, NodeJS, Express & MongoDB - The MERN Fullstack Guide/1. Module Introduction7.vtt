00:00:02.100 --> 00:00:08.450
Now in order to build an application with the Mearns stack we need to thoroughly understand how it works.

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:16.080
So in this module will dive a bit into Merlin and how the different pieces work together in theory towards

3
00:00:16.080 --> 00:00:22.780
the end of this module we'll also have a look at simple Mirna application.

4
00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:25.740
But of course for the course will then build a bigger one.

5
00:00:25.740 --> 00:00:30.260
But learning this theory and understanding the big picture is crucial.

6
00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:37.530
Specifically in this module we will have a look at all the different pieces react node Express and Mongo

7
00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:44.730
TB and understand how these pieces are connected or how these pieces are working together because of

8
00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.330
course Data's in the anti essence of the Mearns stack.

9
00:00:48.330 --> 00:00:52.340
Do you understand how to combine all these technologies.

10
00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:59.070
You will all learn in this module that there is more than one way of combining these technologies and

11
00:00:59.070 --> 00:01:05.160
therefore we'll have a look at those different approaches and I'll explain the pros and cons of the

12
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:09.120
different approaches and which approach we'll use in this course.

13
00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:15.000
And with that let's dive right in and let's have a look at the big picture of the Mearns stack and how

14
00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:16.170
that all works.
