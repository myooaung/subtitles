1
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:08,390
To control the visibility let's go back to main navigation because ultimately that is where we have

2
00:00:08,390 --> 00:00:14,780
to draw and where we also have that menu button that hamburger icon Indian here.

3
00:00:14,930 --> 00:00:19,420
I want to manage some state I want to manage the state where to draw is opened or not.

4
00:00:19,490 --> 00:00:22,330
So we have to import U.S. State from react.

5
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:30,970
And then here we can have our draw is open state and set draw is open as a function to update that state.

6
00:00:31,040 --> 00:00:36,070
And initially let's say that is false with the US state and the initial state.

7
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:42,580
Now we can use draw is open to only sometimes rendered as straw and one way of doing that is to wrap

8
00:00:42,580 --> 00:00:47,840
the draw here into curly braces and then check if draw is open is true.

9
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:53,770
And if it is the case with a ternary expression rendered a side draw otherwise rendered null which means

10
00:00:53,770 --> 00:00:56,710
render nothing.

11
00:00:56,740 --> 00:01:01,570
This is how we can conditionally render content and react if we do that.

12
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,460
You see it's not open now.

13
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:10,650
By the way we can also shorten this and take advantage of JavaScript and use ideological and operator

14
00:01:10,650 --> 00:01:15,830
here which means if this is true this year will be rendered.

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:17,090
This is how jobs good works.

16
00:01:17,100 --> 00:01:20,380
It's a vanilla javascript so it has the same effect.

17
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,330
Now we need to make sure that when we click our button we do open the drawer.

18
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:33,090
So on the button we can add on click prop and then add a function to our main navigation functional

19
00:01:33,090 --> 00:01:39,660
component which will name open drawer and dare I want to well open my drawer.

20
00:01:39,690 --> 00:01:48,090
So here I want to call set draw is open and set it to true change to stage to true here on click.

21
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:56,460
I will point at Open draw if you do that I can now click this button and the draw is there.

22
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,740
It's not animated but it's there.

23
00:01:58,950 --> 00:02:01,770
Unfortunately now we can't close it anymore.

24
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:04,400
So that's something we should fix for that.

25
00:02:04,470 --> 00:02:12,890
I'll also add a number of function closed drawer and here I want to set drawers open to falls of course

26
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,070
the question just is where do we trigger this.

27
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:21,680
For that we need a new component a component we can render as a background to the draw so that when

28
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:27,770
we then clicked this background we close to draw and you find such a component attached backdrops sip

29
00:02:27,980 --> 00:02:34,700
holds a new component which you should add to your UI elements folder next to Avatar and cart you have

30
00:02:34,700 --> 00:02:41,120
a backdrop see as as fall in a backdrop J as follow the backdrop component also utilizes the portal

31
00:02:41,180 --> 00:02:49,220
concept and therefore you should add such a backdrop hook place in your inexact Cheval file above the

32
00:02:49,220 --> 00:02:56,450
draw hook I'll add the backdrop hook and the backdrop is simply well a backdrop a background which is

33
00:02:56,450 --> 00:02:58,370
rendered behind the draw.

34
00:02:58,370 --> 00:03:06,360
For example now in May navigation I also day from one to render the backdrop conditionally.

35
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:13,520
So there we can check if draw is open is true and if it is render the backdrop not important you need

36
00:03:13,520 --> 00:03:16,830
to import backdrop for in order to use it.

37
00:03:16,940 --> 00:03:19,760
So import backdrop from

38
00:03:22,450 --> 00:03:32,870
and now let's go to UI elements and then backdrop with that we rendered the backdrop and the backdrop

39
00:03:32,870 --> 00:03:36,140
component listens to a click on the backdrop.

40
00:03:36,140 --> 00:03:42,100
So on this background and then emits a function it expects to get on on click prop its own.

41
00:03:42,860 --> 00:03:50,240
So on the backdrop we can add on click because we do handle such a prop there and bind that too close

42
00:03:50,240 --> 00:03:54,480
draw and now if we safeties we can open it.

43
00:03:54,510 --> 00:03:57,570
Now we have that background it's a bit darker than before.

44
00:03:57,660 --> 00:04:00,010
If you click that it closes.

45
00:04:00,150 --> 00:04:03,410
So that's great but a little animation would be nice right.

46
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:05,670
So let's add an animation in the next lecture.
