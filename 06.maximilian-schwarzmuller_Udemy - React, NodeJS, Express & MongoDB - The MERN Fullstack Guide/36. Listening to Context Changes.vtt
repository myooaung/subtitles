00:00:02.170 --> 00:00:06.380
Now is that the question is of course which components are interested.

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:14.280
Well for example our navigation or specifically the link stair if we go to NAV links we have a couple

3
00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:18.330
of links which we only want to show if we're not authenticated and links.

4
00:00:18.330 --> 00:00:27.340
We only want to show if we are authenticated so here in NAV links let's import of context from

5
00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:35.710
the context folder and then of context and import a new hook which we haven't used before.

6
00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.610
Use context.

7
00:00:37.610 --> 00:00:39.390
And this does what the name implies.

8
00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:43.330
It allows us to tap into a context to listen to it.

9
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:51.380
So to say so here we can then call use context and pass in the off context just like this and we'll

10
00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:58.310
we get back is an object which will hold the latest context and this component will re render when Abbott

11
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:00.550
is context we're listening to changes.

12
00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:09.680
That's the magic react manages for us behind the scenes so here then off is object that holds that is

13
00:01:09.680 --> 00:01:19.020
locked in property to log in method into logout method and we can now utilize this for example my places

14
00:01:19.290 --> 00:01:25.380
should only be visible if we are locked in so I'll check if it is locked in is a thing and only rendered

15
00:01:25.380 --> 00:01:32.570
as list item if it is at place all also only makes sense if we are locked in.

16
00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:40.200
So let's render it appropriately authenticate on the other end only makes sense if we're not locked

17
00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:46.410
in because there is no reason to authenticate if we are locked in with dead what you see when you reload

18
00:01:46.410 --> 00:01:52.980
is that at the beginning you only see all users and authenticate you still see the edit and delete buttons

19
00:01:53.040 --> 00:01:56.300
but that's something we'll still take care about.

20
00:01:56.530 --> 00:02:03.440
Now let's make sure that when we click log in here we actually trigger does log and method on our context.

21
00:02:03.580 --> 00:02:07.110
Q Changed at state now also try this on your own.

22
00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:09.010
We'll do it together in the next lecture.
