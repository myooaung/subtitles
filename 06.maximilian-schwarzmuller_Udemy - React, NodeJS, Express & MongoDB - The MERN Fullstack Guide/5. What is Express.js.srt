1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:08,700
So we saw no Jesus and that it can be a bit cumbersome to work with no Che is only what is expressed

2
00:00:08,710 --> 00:00:12,960
chase then express jazz is a framework for no jazz.

3
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:15,340
So that means we use no jazz.

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:21,640
We write JavaScript code in the node environment but express makes certain things easier just as react

5
00:00:21,670 --> 00:00:24,510
which by definition is a library and not a framework.

6
00:00:24,520 --> 00:00:29,860
But it's pretty close to each other just like react makes things easier in the browser where angular

7
00:00:29,950 --> 00:00:32,890
or view or other libraries or frameworks in the browser.

8
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:38,440
The idea behind a framework always is to give you a lot of utility functions and methods and things

9
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,710
that allow you to focus on your core business logic and not so much on reinventing the wheel and building

10
00:00:44,710 --> 00:00:50,260
all these core primitives or doing all these primitive tasks like passing data again.

11
00:00:50,530 --> 00:00:56,080
So it makes building Web apps server side code in decades of no charge is much easier.

12
00:00:56,080 --> 00:01:03,040
And one thing that is specific about express or specific Q express is that it's middleware focused which

13
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:07,330
won't tell you much right now but by the end of this module it will.

14
00:01:07,330 --> 00:01:08,650
So let's add Express.

15
00:01:08,710 --> 00:01:13,000
Asked to our simple application here and see how that simplifies things.
