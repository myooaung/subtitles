00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.370
Welcome to this module in this module.

2
00:00:04.390 --> 00:00:11.350
It's finally time to connect our back end to a real database for this purpose we will use Mongo D.B.

3
00:00:11.350 --> 00:00:18.160
and Mongoose to manage this connection between our backend and Mongo TB and probably continue.

4
00:00:18.190 --> 00:00:24.550
Make sure to dive into the refresh module all as a part of this course in case mongoloid TB and Mongoose

5
00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:26.410
are totally new to you.

6
00:00:26.410 --> 00:00:29.890
If you know the basics of these tools already then you can continue.

7
00:00:29.980 --> 00:00:36.190
And in this module will then have a look at how we can define or Mongoose models because mongoose is

8
00:00:36.190 --> 00:00:37.330
all about models.

9
00:00:37.330 --> 00:00:40.810
This means we will have to create a place model and a user model.

10
00:00:40.810 --> 00:00:49.630
Both models will define the general structure of these so-called documents stored in our model TB database.

11
00:00:49.630 --> 00:00:56.180
Besides that we'll also have a look at CRUD operations for our places and our users crud stands for

12
00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:58.710
Create read update and delete.

13
00:00:58.780 --> 00:01:05.360
And these are typically operations you have to do if you want to interact with a database finally.

14
00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:09.870
We'll also have a look at the relation between places and users.

15
00:01:09.900 --> 00:01:15.190
We will establish a connection between these two because if we for example create a new place then this

16
00:01:15.190 --> 00:01:18.610
place should be allocated to a specific user.

17
00:01:18.610 --> 00:01:20.350
This logic is missing so far.

18
00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:23.180
Therefore it is time to implement it and prove that.

19
00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:24.930
Let's dive into this module.
