1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:06,310
Let's work on authentication and here's a little challenge for you.

2
00:00:06,370 --> 00:00:09,750
Try starting this or working on this on your own for Dad.

3
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,310
Make sure that when we click authenticate here we're not taking to this page but to a brand new page

4
00:00:15,340 --> 00:00:18,100
which you have to create in the user pages folder.

5
00:00:18,100 --> 00:00:25,630
You could named as page of as or authenticate jazz or something like this on this new page add a form

6
00:00:26,140 --> 00:00:33,010
you can use to use form hook for that and add a form that renders that email and the password field.

7
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:38,590
You also want to add some validation to these fields and then you tell for example you find this function

8
00:00:38,590 --> 00:00:40,950
you can execute to setup email validation.

9
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:47,710
The password should be validated with validator min to check that it's at least let's say 5 6 7 whatever

10
00:00:47,710 --> 00:00:48,170
you want.

11
00:00:48,180 --> 00:00:54,670
Characters long so add such a form utilizing our form hook and this validation and T input component

12
00:00:54,940 --> 00:00:57,190
and added on a brand new form.

13
00:00:57,190 --> 00:01:00,280
Definitely try this out on your own as a next step.

14
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,830
After a short pause which I give you to pass this lecture and try it on your own we'll do it together

15
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:10,110
so where are you successful.

16
00:01:10,110 --> 00:01:13,800
Let's try to gather and for that I will add a brand new page here.

17
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,070
The off J.S. page in the user pages folder.

18
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,750
I will also add off C as s to have some styling for it and attached you find that styling you can just

19
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,000
paste it in there and I'll leave it up to you whether you now use my styling and my markup or a stick

20
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:30,780
to yours.

21
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,220
The general logic of course should be the same so that we have no problems in the rest of the course.

22
00:01:36,270 --> 00:01:40,460
So in the off J is file of course we import react from react.

23
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:48,210
We import that off CSX file we just added to get the styling and then here we have the off component

24
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:56,530
which will render some J as X later and we export this off component now instead of the off component

25
00:01:56,530 --> 00:02:02,290
for the moment I'll just render off as a text here to see whether I can get there because an aptly as

26
00:02:02,290 --> 00:02:08,530
I now want to registered as a root and there I simply want to add a brand new route maybe here at the

27
00:02:08,530 --> 00:02:18,770
end where the path is slash off let's say and then we render our all page which we therefore need to

28
00:02:18,770 --> 00:02:19,310
import.

29
00:02:19,340 --> 00:02:30,460
So here we got off from slash user Seth slash pages slash off and off is getting rendered here like

30
00:02:30,460 --> 00:02:36,470
this OK so now with that if I now click on authenticate I'm taken to the off page.

31
00:02:36,470 --> 00:02:37,310
So that's working.

32
00:02:37,370 --> 00:02:43,490
Of course make sure that the link here in the NAF links is the same link you're watching for in your

33
00:02:43,490 --> 00:02:45,110
out config.

34
00:02:45,170 --> 00:02:51,740
So now in the off page let's replace the H to tag with the actual content we want there and the actual

35
00:02:51,740 --> 00:02:55,060
content we want there of course is totally up to you.

36
00:02:55,100 --> 00:02:59,910
I of course want to have a form in there but a form which I will wrap into a card.

37
00:03:00,020 --> 00:03:05,620
So import card from shared components UI elements card.

38
00:03:05,930 --> 00:03:17,560
So I'll actually wrap everything here in such a card like that and splits across multiple lines to make

39
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:19,820
it easier to read.

40
00:03:20,050 --> 00:03:26,200
And besides my card here or besides my form in the card I want I have some text subtitle where it's

41
00:03:26,230 --> 00:03:32,050
a log and required and then maybe there's horizontal separator just to have some visual separation between

42
00:03:32,050 --> 00:03:34,720
the title and the actual form on the card.

43
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:45,140
I'll also add a class name of authentication which is simply a class set up here in of CSX now inside

44
00:03:45,140 --> 00:03:48,430
of the form we can now add our controls.

45
00:03:48,740 --> 00:03:58,160
So let's import input from shared components form elements input and let's repeat that for the button.

46
00:03:58,160 --> 00:04:06,650
So let's import button from shared components form elements button so that we have these two things

47
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:08,490
that way label these two components.

48
00:04:08,490 --> 00:04:12,940
And now in the form we can add our button here our input here excuse me.

49
00:04:12,940 --> 00:04:23,620
And that will be the input for the email so I'll set an I.D. of email here I will also set the element

50
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,970
here to input because it should be a regular input.

51
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,080
The type can be set to email here.

52
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:40,500
So if we take advantage of this native built in email type and the label can also be email to give the

53
00:04:40,500 --> 00:04:45,660
user a clearer idea of what we want their validators of course is an array and they are a mentioned

54
00:04:45,690 --> 00:04:48,540
that we can use some of the validators I created.

55
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:57,990
So I will import them from shared you tell validators there I want to have these validator email and

56
00:04:57,990 --> 00:04:59,810
do validator Min length.

57
00:04:59,820 --> 00:05:06,900
That is what I need so here then I will execute validators email as a function to add that email validation

58
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:16,540
here and also provide an error text which could be Please enter a valid email address like that now

59
00:05:16,590 --> 00:05:21,820
on change all the needs to be connected to something and here I will use my custom hook again.

60
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:36,000
So import use form from shared hooks form OK so that we can call use form up there and initialize it

61
00:05:36,030 --> 00:05:38,780
initially to form is invalid and 40 inputs.

62
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:46,500
We have a email input where the value is empty and which is also invalid initially and will also then

63
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:55,090
have a password input where where the value will also be empty initially and it's also invalid.

64
00:05:55,090 --> 00:06:03,550
So that's my initial state and then just as before use for returns something it returns an array with

65
00:06:03,640 --> 00:06:04,600
three elements.

66
00:06:04,600 --> 00:06:11,320
I need two of them here for now and it's a form state and the input handler and now the input handler

67
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:18,790
here can be bound to on change on this input and then we can replicate duplicate this input here and

68
00:06:18,790 --> 00:06:27,160
create a separate second input with an I.D. of password and a type of password and a label of password

69
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:32,910
and a validator of let's say Min length 5.

70
00:06:32,950 --> 00:06:38,070
But it's up to you which Min length you want to require here and of course here it will say in the error

71
00:06:38,060 --> 00:06:45,240
attacks Please enter a valid password at least five characters.

72
00:06:45,390 --> 00:06:53,610
Now let's all at a button here of type submit and on the button I'll say log in for a moment later we'll

73
00:06:53,610 --> 00:07:00,530
also add a sign up functionality but for now it's just about logging in now that button should be disabled

74
00:07:00,530 --> 00:07:01,640
if the form is invalid.

75
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:08,820
So we'll set this April equal to not form state is valid if the form is not valid the buttons disabled

76
00:07:11,230 --> 00:07:12,080
with that.

77
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:14,960
This should actually work.

78
00:07:14,980 --> 00:07:25,430
Let's save this and I get an error or yes because it's not on change but on input on our own input components

79
00:07:25,450 --> 00:07:30,480
so let's replace on change with on input there and that looks a lot better.

80
00:07:30,780 --> 00:07:33,240
Now we will see if I enter the email here.

81
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:35,220
This is not valid.

82
00:07:35,310 --> 00:07:41,070
If I tap out of there as soon as I make it a valid e-mail address it is except that though password

83
00:07:41,070 --> 00:07:45,020
has to be at least five characters long and then it's accepted as well.

84
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,760
And yeah this all seems to work here.

85
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:54,070
Let's also submit it and of course that does not work yet because I haven't added a submit handler.

86
00:07:54,250 --> 00:08:04,140
So let's add a new function here the off submit handler maybe where we get the event and then call event

87
00:08:04,140 --> 00:08:10,190
prevent default to prevent this automatic submission of this request and the reloading of the page data

88
00:08:10,210 --> 00:08:16,470
for and then in here I will cancel lock form state later as always we'll do more.

89
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:22,140
I'll actually console Lockport and state inputs later we'll do more because later we will also have

90
00:08:22,140 --> 00:08:28,770
a back and for now let's just bind on submit here to the off submit handler where we log our input state

91
00:08:29,790 --> 00:08:30,470
now is dead.

92
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:34,910
If we retry that enters some data here log in.

93
00:08:34,980 --> 00:08:36,540
This looks good to me.

94
00:08:36,540 --> 00:08:43,830
So this basic form is working and that's nice it also shows us how reusable our own hook and the input

95
00:08:43,830 --> 00:08:44,820
component is.

96
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,150
But of course logging in alone is not enough.

97
00:08:48,150 --> 00:08:54,380
Users have to sign up before they can log in and during sign up they should also provide a name.

98
00:08:54,450 --> 00:08:59,400
And of course we want to able to switch between both modes so you can also try implementing this on

99
00:08:59,400 --> 00:08:59,910
your own.

100
00:08:59,940 --> 00:09:02,760
It will be a bit more tricky in the next lecture.

101
00:09:02,820 --> 00:09:03,780
We'll do it together.
