1
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:09,140
So the missing pieces that we can delete places and for that on user places on a single place.

2
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:15,030
So on such a place item actually in the place item component we get that delete button and there at

3
00:00:15,030 --> 00:00:22,190
the moment or just console logging deleting here instead I want to send that age to the request now.

4
00:00:22,410 --> 00:00:34,240
So to do that again we import our custom hook so to use HBP client hook from shared hooks age to be

5
00:00:34,250 --> 00:00:37,340
hook of course that's the hook we need.

6
00:00:37,340 --> 00:00:45,320
Now just as before we can initialize it here with object restructuring and get is loading our or a send

7
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:51,830
request and clear error all the functionality is we used multiple times by now and we want to send the

8
00:00:51,830 --> 00:00:56,600
request and they confirmed delete handler now because dad Data's when we're sure that we want to delete

9
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:03,810
we can turn us into a sync function date for us so that we can use a single wait in there and call send

10
00:01:03,810 --> 00:01:09,870
request and send us to a specific you are ell which has a dynamic segment which is why I'm adding back

11
00:01:09,870 --> 00:01:12,650
ticks here why I'm using back ticks.

12
00:01:12,660 --> 00:01:17,670
Because if we check the back and then our places routes we see that the place I.D. needs to be part

13
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:18,630
of the U.R.L..

14
00:01:18,660 --> 00:01:26,220
So we need to send this to local host five thousand slash API slash places slash the idea of the place.

15
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:39,050
So here it is HDP local host five thousand slash API slash places slash the idea of the place and we

16
00:01:39,050 --> 00:01:40,870
get that place idea here.

17
00:01:40,940 --> 00:01:45,060
Fruit props in place list I forward the.

18
00:01:45,080 --> 00:01:52,250
Prop here which points at the place I.D. So in place item J.S. I can just use prop stored ideas here

19
00:01:53,540 --> 00:01:56,540
this sends a request but by default that gets request.

20
00:01:56,690 --> 00:01:59,950
So we should change this to delete to make sure it's a delete request.

21
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:06,320
We don't need to add any body or extra headers though we can then await this and of course all the rapid

22
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:11,190
and try catch to ensure that we only continue if this really succeeded.

23
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:15,550
So here and catch I won't do anything.

24
00:02:15,550 --> 00:02:16,440
If we succeed.

25
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:18,840
The question is What do I want to do.

26
00:02:18,880 --> 00:02:24,400
Well in the end I want to reload the page we're on right because in the end we are on the page where

27
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,090
we display all places.

28
00:02:26,140 --> 00:02:33,010
Well if we deleted a place I just want to make sure that we update the current page knowing the place

29
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:39,180
list component we need and map our list of places into place.

30
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:49,850
Items and we get our items here from user places in the end and then user places we have our loaded

31
00:02:50,030 --> 00:02:50,880
places.

32
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:54,930
So in the end we need to tweak the loaded places once we delete a place.

33
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:57,010
So in the place item component.

34
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:06,440
Once we're done deleting I will call props on the lead and expect that on delete I get a function which

35
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:09,010
in the end therefore is executed through that prop.

36
00:03:09,260 --> 00:03:15,020
So in the places component we have to make sure that we set the on the lead prop on a place item which

37
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:19,280
is where I call this to a function which I expect to get from outside.

38
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,730
So here in place list I will also call on delete place let's say.

39
00:03:24,740 --> 00:03:30,260
So I will forward this to a number of function I expect to get on a on delete place prop directly on

40
00:03:30,260 --> 00:03:32,340
this place list component.

41
00:03:32,390 --> 00:03:37,570
So now we need to set on the left place as a prop on the place list here.

42
00:03:41,230 --> 00:03:42,060
On the left place.

43
00:03:42,060 --> 00:03:48,220
And now here in user places with just a component I'm working and now there I want to trigger a function

44
00:03:49,420 --> 00:03:51,240
plays deleted.

45
00:03:51,340 --> 00:03:53,150
Handler maybe.

46
00:03:53,260 --> 00:03:56,850
And here I want to update my loaded places appropriately.

47
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:03,850
So let's put plays deleted handler into all delete place and Dale for in the end we forwarded to on

48
00:04:03,850 --> 00:04:04,830
the lead in the place.

49
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,690
Item and then user replaces Indy's place to lead handler.

50
00:04:09,690 --> 00:04:14,550
I don't want to call set loaded places and update my loaded places and then when I update them such

51
00:04:14,550 --> 00:04:20,940
that they filter out the place which was just deleted for Dad we can use the function form of setting

52
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:22,000
a state here.

53
00:04:22,140 --> 00:04:27,600
So we got our previous places and I want to return to new places and the new places are based on the

54
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,010
previous places but there.

55
00:04:29,010 --> 00:04:35,700
This is an array I want to call the filter method to filter out a certain place so we'll go through

56
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:44,130
all my places here and only keep the places where the idea is not equal to let's say the deleted place

57
00:04:44,130 --> 00:04:51,050
I.D. which I expect to get as an argument here so I expect to get this parameter here delete the place

58
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:56,090
idea and only if the place I'm looking at in my existing array of places is not equal.

59
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,090
I'll keep it because if it is equal it's the place I want to delete.

60
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,540
So in the new Array which I return here it should not be included so that I set my loaded place a state

61
00:05:05,540 --> 00:05:11,950
to a new array where the deleted place is filtered out now we just have to make sure that we pass this

62
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:19,490
delete it place I.D. to this function and in the end we are calling this function place item J.S. here.

63
00:05:19,490 --> 00:05:24,210
So here we should forward props I.D. because that's the idea of the place which was deleted.

64
00:05:25,540 --> 00:05:27,430
This is the trick.

65
00:05:27,430 --> 00:05:29,370
Hopefully this should do the trick.

66
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:36,250
Now let's still handle the loading and the error state here and therefore we import the arrow modal

67
00:05:36,250 --> 00:05:49,030
from shared components UI elements error modal add of course import our loading spinner here from shared

68
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:54,550
components UI elements loading spinner.

69
00:05:54,740 --> 00:06:03,980
And with that if we go down there and react fragment we can add our error modal here and there forward

70
00:06:04,070 --> 00:06:13,050
our error we might be getting and point on clearer at clear error or side note also make sure that and

71
00:06:13,050 --> 00:06:14,400
confirm delete handler.

72
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:21,180
You call set show confirm modal false first so that you close to confirm modal before you sent that

73
00:06:21,180 --> 00:06:24,690
request and may be all to open up an error mode thereafter.

74
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,490
So we don't have multiple models open at the same time and to all the show loading state.

75
00:06:30,510 --> 00:06:33,840
I'll scroll down and here inside of my card.

76
00:06:33,870 --> 00:06:42,300
So on top of this place which I want to delete I will check for is loading and then send or render my

77
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,400
loading spinner in that overly mode.

78
00:06:45,750 --> 00:06:48,970
If we are loading with that if we save this.

79
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:50,730
Here are the places.

80
00:06:50,730 --> 00:06:59,210
Let's now log in like that and now a year if I click delete I can cancel Of course.

81
00:06:59,450 --> 00:07:02,600
But if I click delete here you'll see the loading spinner.

82
00:07:02,750 --> 00:07:07,130
And we're done now this year looks good to me.

83
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:08,620
It seems to work if I reload.

84
00:07:08,630 --> 00:07:10,090
Let's see if it still is gone.

85
00:07:10,100 --> 00:07:12,640
It is and if we check the database now.

86
00:07:14,030 --> 00:07:18,360
And we refresh the places we should only see one place.

87
00:07:18,380 --> 00:07:19,680
Yes we do.

88
00:07:19,760 --> 00:07:25,760
And for a user as if we check that we should also see that the first user only has one connect the place

89
00:07:25,850 --> 00:07:32,000
so that this connection to the place was all that clear there and the other users have no places.

90
00:07:32,330 --> 00:07:37,400
And this is looking good to me it looks like our application is working and we successfully connect

91
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:38,780
that front end and back end.
