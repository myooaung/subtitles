1
00:00:01,990 --> 00:00:04,660
And let's get started with well a very important question.

2
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,090
What is Mongolia to actually no longer.

3
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:12,420
B is a no secret database which stores documents in so-called collections.

4
00:00:12,430 --> 00:00:16,850
Now if you're coming from a secret world and as a developer chances are that this is the case.

5
00:00:16,990 --> 00:00:21,240
You might refer to documents as records and collections as tables.

6
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:27,100
Now with Mongolia being a database we use it to store application data in our course project as would

7
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:34,720
be users and places and storing this data doesn't enforce a specific data schema or any relations we

8
00:00:34,720 --> 00:00:36,080
can define a data schema.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:40,520
But it's not really strict and we can also have relations lots of tools throughout this module.

10
00:00:40,630 --> 00:00:47,080
But in contrast to a secret database for relations player coral this is not the case for no secret databases

11
00:00:47,140 --> 00:00:49,380
like Mongolia and Mongolia.

12
00:00:49,380 --> 00:00:55,030
It can also be easily connected to node and express but very important we can connect Mongolia to our

13
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:55,420
back.

14
00:00:55,450 --> 00:00:59,110
And therefore we do not connect it directly to our front end.

15
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:00,860
More about that in a few minutes.

16
00:01:00,910 --> 00:01:06,820
So to summarize that Mongolia Bee is a powerful data base and it can be easily integrated into a node

17
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,720
express environment so the environment we're using in this course.

18
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:16,150
One important note though you can of course also use other databases secret databases for example.

19
00:01:16,300 --> 00:01:18,310
And this brings us to the next question.

20
00:01:18,370 --> 00:01:22,080
What is the difference between a no sequel and a sequel database.

21
00:01:22,150 --> 00:01:24,660
And why are we using a no sequel database here.
