1
00:00:02,260 --> 00:00:07,990
So let's use our custom HDP hook into users component for that first of all we need to import and of

2
00:00:07,990 --> 00:00:17,680
course import use age to be client from shared hooks age to the PUK then justice before we can get rid

3
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,420
of these estates not off load of users.

4
00:00:20,470 --> 00:00:27,550
I do want to manage this here in this component so I will call use h to be client here and what we get

5
00:00:27,550 --> 00:00:27,930
back.

6
00:00:27,940 --> 00:00:30,970
Just as before is an object which we can do structure.

7
00:00:31,120 --> 00:00:39,250
There will have to is loading stayed our potential error state will then also have our send request

8
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:42,720
function there and to clear error function.

9
00:00:42,760 --> 00:00:49,030
Now here I already got send request as a name and to a wide duplication all named as here fetch users

10
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:56,250
and they offer recall fetch users here of course so a little adjustment in the use affect function.

11
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:03,080
Then in here we can get rid of set is loading and then here I want to have try catch of course but I

12
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:04,990
will await send requests.

13
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:07,850
So does function that comes from my custom hook.

14
00:01:07,850 --> 00:01:16,720
This needs are you are L and actually nothing else because it is configured to as a default send a GET

15
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,860
request not add anybody and not add any special headers.

16
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:22,890
So this is just fine as it is.

17
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,840
We don't need to do that parsing as you learned.

18
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,470
However of course what I get back here is my response data now because we do that parsing in the send

19
00:01:32,470 --> 00:01:38,760
request function in our custom hook and therefore here we can set our loaded users if we have an error

20
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,600
we don't need to do anything here.

21
00:01:40,870 --> 00:01:43,630
And I will remove set as loading here.

22
00:01:43,630 --> 00:01:49,030
Now you see it as a fact complains here about a missing dependency because now indeed send request is

23
00:01:49,030 --> 00:01:50,530
a dependency off use effect.

24
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,560
I used to send request function in there and the send request function is coming from outside.

25
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:04,330
The effect that's why it is important to have send request be wrapped and use callback here indie custom

26
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:05,050
hook.

27
00:02:05,050 --> 00:02:10,950
Because if this would not be wrapped in use callback it would be recreated whenever to hook reruns and

28
00:02:10,950 --> 00:02:17,350
the hook reruns whenever the component that uses the hook reruns because they recall use HD to be client

29
00:02:17,470 --> 00:02:20,330
and it is just a regular Java's could function after all.

30
00:02:20,330 --> 00:02:26,200
So of course it executes again and if does reruns and gives us a new send Request object even with the

31
00:02:26,200 --> 00:02:31,360
same logic in the function it's technically a new object you as a fact would fire again and then you

32
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:38,080
request and we would have an infinite loop so use callback around send request in our custom hook is

33
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:39,570
super important.

34
00:02:39,700 --> 00:02:46,570
With that we can correctly specify it as a dependency here as we should and we are sending our request.

35
00:02:46,570 --> 00:02:53,140
Now we can get rid of the error handler and just point at clear error here on the on Clear prop and

36
00:02:53,140 --> 00:02:54,330
with that we should be good.

37
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:59,980
If I now reload you see this seems to work if I reload we're fetching the users.

38
00:02:59,980 --> 00:03:02,830
Now let's also see if we correctly get an error here.

39
00:03:02,830 --> 00:03:10,100
If a for example sent us to an invalid you are L where I removed the s at the end and I get an error

40
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:11,770
could not find this root.

41
00:03:11,990 --> 00:03:17,750
So this works of course our application is broken now but this clearly also is an error we should catch

42
00:03:17,870 --> 00:03:19,670
as a developer during development.

43
00:03:20,120 --> 00:03:23,130
So with that it works again.

44
00:03:23,270 --> 00:03:25,470
This is looking pretty decent to me.

45
00:03:25,580 --> 00:03:32,450
We're using our custom hook here and with the custom hook added now and being used in all our user related

46
00:03:32,450 --> 00:03:40,460
routes it's now finally time to make sure that if we are authenticated we actually also are able to

47
00:03:40,460 --> 00:03:46,200
create a new place here and send the request to the appropriate back and route there as well.
