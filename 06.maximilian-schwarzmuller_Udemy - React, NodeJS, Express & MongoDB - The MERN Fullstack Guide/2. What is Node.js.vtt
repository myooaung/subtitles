What is note J.S. wouldn't hurt to understand that if we want to write some note code right.

2
00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.790
So no chance is in the end a host environment for JavaScript a runtime for JavaScript you could say.

3
00:00:13.920 --> 00:00:20.520
Now for that of course it's important to understand that JavaScript is the programming language and

4
00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.730
most of us started with JavaScript in the browser.

5
00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:31.080
It is the only programming language began using the browser to write some logic dare to execute some

6
00:00:31.080 --> 00:00:36.060
logic there to change the document after it has been loaded and so on.

7
00:00:36.210 --> 00:00:43.290
For all of that we need javascript the browser therefore is one host environment of that JavaScript

8
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:45.960
language but it's not the only one.

9
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.320
Basically one of the most popular and important browser javascript engines the 8 which is the engine

10
00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:55.370
built into Chrome has been taken out of chrome.

11
00:00:55.380 --> 00:01:02.130
It's still in there too but it has all been cloned and is now maintained as a standalone project and

12
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.760
that is basically no JSA.

13
00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:10.860
It's a JavaScript engine originally built for the browser now working without a browser and enriched

14
00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:16.310
with some extra API eyes so it allows us to run javascript outside of the browser.

15
00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.460
And of course that means that some API eyes were dropped.

16
00:01:19.470 --> 00:01:26.460
For example we no longer can interact with the DOM if we're writing no trace code because we don't execute

17
00:01:26.490 --> 00:01:32.250
the javascript code in a browser environment and therefore there is no Dom but new APIs are available

18
00:01:32.430 --> 00:01:33.180
in the browser.

19
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:40.770
For example you can't really work with the file system for security reasons you can't store files on

20
00:01:40.770 --> 00:01:44.190
the system of your users or read files from there.

21
00:01:44.190 --> 00:01:51.060
Well no try as you can do that because no trace does not execute on computers of the visitors of your

22
00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:55.450
webpage but instead you execute it on a computer of your choice.

23
00:01:55.530 --> 00:02:04.290
For example on a computer on a machine you expose as a server to the Internet that is no chance it's

24
00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.670
javascript outside of the browser with new tricks learned and some tricks unlearned I guess.

25
00:02:11.670 --> 00:02:18.960
And with no chance we can write any kind of application any kind of script with JavaScript doesn't have

26
00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:26.220
to be code that handles incoming requests but often it is because one popular use case of no choice

27
00:02:26.580 --> 00:02:34.700
is to use it to build Web servers which handle incoming requests maybe talk to databases and also send

28
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:42.210
back responses so that we can use no tricks as basically as a replacement for PSP for example or Java

29
00:02:42.330 --> 00:02:48.630
or ACP dot net that is one very prominent use case and it is the use case we will look into in this

30
00:02:48.630 --> 00:02:53.400
module because that is exactly what we'll use it for for all the rest of this course.
