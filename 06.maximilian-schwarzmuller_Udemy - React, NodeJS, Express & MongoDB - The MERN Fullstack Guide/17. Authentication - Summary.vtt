00:00:02.230 --> 00:00:06.370
And this is it for authentication and authorization.

2
00:00:06.370 --> 00:00:09.670
As you can tell it has multiple layers for one.

3
00:00:09.670 --> 00:00:13.510
Of course it affects both the front end and the back and on the front.

4
00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.750
If we want to control what we see so that we for example can't edit places that don't belong to us we

5
00:00:19.750 --> 00:00:25.750
want to be able to edit our own ones of course though we also want to manage log in and authentication

6
00:00:25.750 --> 00:00:27.150
there to stay locked in.

7
00:00:27.160 --> 00:00:35.050
But to also automatically log the user out once the token expired and that token is the heart of authentication

8
00:00:35.320 --> 00:00:40.290
on the front and we just change what we show to the user on the back end.

9
00:00:40.300 --> 00:00:47.290
On the other hand we create this token here adjacent web token to be precise we can store data in it

10
00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:49.930
and we then and that's very important.

11
00:00:49.930 --> 00:00:56.920
We then make sure that we also validate and verify this token so that we can protect certain routes

12
00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.970
with a middleware year against an authenticated access.

13
00:01:01.030 --> 00:01:06.220
We check whether we do have a token and if it's a valid token and then we can extract data from the

14
00:01:06.220 --> 00:01:09.430
token and attached us to our requests.

15
00:01:09.460 --> 00:01:15.640
Besides does authentication logic here though where we check whether we do have a token we also can

16
00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:23.230
do all forestation to ensure that for example only a user who created a place is able to edit it.

17
00:01:23.230 --> 00:01:27.950
This also is an important part of authentication and authorization.

18
00:01:28.090 --> 00:01:32.080
And in this module you'll learn about this part as well.

19
00:01:32.140 --> 00:01:37.300
With that I just got some tiny tweaks on the back end which we can apply but which you don't have to

20
00:01:37.660 --> 00:01:44.140
the core of logic should be clear now and how the back end at the front end are connected there and

21
00:01:44.140 --> 00:01:46.840
what the responsibility of each side is.
