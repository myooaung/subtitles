1
00:00:02,180 --> 00:00:08,510
So let's make sure we all use our token on update and delete requests because these are the two remaining

2
00:00:08,510 --> 00:00:12,080
routes which are protected so for dead.

3
00:00:12,090 --> 00:00:14,890
Let's maybe start with update place.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:21,690
There we have our age to DPD request here and there we already are attaching a header but of course

5
00:00:21,690 --> 00:00:23,370
you can attach more than one header.

6
00:00:23,370 --> 00:00:30,970
We can also add authorization here and now we need access to our off object our of context.

7
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:37,410
Conveniently we already got access here so we can just tap into this existing off object here and get

8
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:38,550
our token from there.

9
00:00:38,550 --> 00:00:45,680
However remember what we added to authorization is not just a token but actually bearer plus token just

10
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:47,940
a convention we're following here.

11
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:51,710
With that we're adding a token here and this should be all for now.

12
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:58,800
Now let's all do this on place item J.S. where we have our delete functionality HERE WE SEND TO DELETE

13
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:06,330
request and at the moment all they do here is set up the U R L and then add my method here.

14
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:12,120
Now we certainly need no bodies that we can pass null here but we want to add our headers object and

15
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:19,590
there we want to set off for a station to bearer plus off token and we already got access to the off

16
00:01:19,590 --> 00:01:23,340
context object already in this file here.

17
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:32,490
So with that token is added to all these requests and hence we can give that a try and quickly authenticate

18
00:01:32,490 --> 00:01:35,220
here with the right user.

19
00:01:35,410 --> 00:01:39,580
We will later of course also add a functionality to stay logged in.

20
00:01:39,580 --> 00:01:46,410
And now if you click edit here and click Update this works and if I click delete does all the works.

21
00:01:46,410 --> 00:01:54,480
So we are able to update and delete places we are adding the token there but we still got missing functionality

22
00:01:54,780 --> 00:01:59,850
for example we still can delete and update places that don't belong to us.

23
00:01:59,910 --> 00:02:02,910
We're having some security mechanisms here on the front end.

24
00:02:02,970 --> 00:02:09,030
For example we only show the buttons if we're the right user but we could use postmen to delete places

25
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,990
which don't belong to us because we have no service protection against that.

26
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:18,720
And addition to that issue on the front that we have the problem that whenever we reload we are locked

27
00:02:18,810 --> 00:02:21,750
out again which of course is all not great.

28
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:23,790
So there still is room for improvement.
