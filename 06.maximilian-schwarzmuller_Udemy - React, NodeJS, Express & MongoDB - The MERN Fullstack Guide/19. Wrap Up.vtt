00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:08.750
From this module we learned a lot about how to work with databases from our node Express back end.

2
00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:11.370
We started in the place cheap asphalt here.

3
00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:16.890
Here we defined our schema and the corresponding model which we then used in the places controller.

4
00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:25.000
Here we were able to perform all CRUD operations so create read update and delete referring to our places

5
00:00:25.020 --> 00:00:25.600
here.

6
00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:28.740
We then applied our knowledge order for the user j s file.

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:34.530
Here we again created a schema and a corresponding model and then they're able to create new users or

8
00:00:34.530 --> 00:00:38.480
to get to existing users in here in our users controllers.

9
00:00:38.490 --> 00:00:43.280
J S file what was missing though was the connection between these two parts.

10
00:00:43.290 --> 00:00:48.200
So between the places and the users this is what we've finally added In this module.

11
00:00:48.360 --> 00:00:53.860
We learned that we can connect different models and schemas with the ref property right here.

12
00:00:53.860 --> 00:00:59.420
And this allowed us to create places and to make sure that when we create a new place the idea of this

13
00:00:59.410 --> 00:01:02.160
place is also added to a corresponding creator.

14
00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.090
At the same time we have to create the right is stored in that place and we also made sure that if we

15
00:01:07.230 --> 00:01:13.290
delete a place that this place or the corresponding at the off displays to be more precise is also removed

16
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:17.230
from our Creator as part of this.

17
00:01:17.250 --> 00:01:20.400
We learned awesome that plots like down here.

18
00:01:20.490 --> 00:01:27.180
Our populate method which makes it very easy to get access to documents stored in different collections

19
00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.700
in Mongo TB.

20
00:01:30.030 --> 00:01:30.870
So this is it.

21
00:01:30.870 --> 00:01:33.590
This was the database part of this course.

22
00:01:33.600 --> 00:01:34.690
I hope you enjoyed it.

23
00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:40.790
And now we can continue with the next part in this will be connecting the front end and the back end.
