00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:08,750
When it comes to deploying more naps I see two main options on how you could do that.

2
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:15,610
The first option probably the better one or the more common one is that you deploy two separate apps.

3
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:18,400
And with that I mean that you use two different servers.

4
00:00:18,410 --> 00:00:19,850
I will come back to that.

5
00:00:19,950 --> 00:00:25,510
The other option is that you deploy one combined app so all on one server.

6
00:00:25,530 --> 00:00:28,160
Now let's have a look at option number one first.

7
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:36,540
So two separated apps they air your react app and your node REST API would simply be deployed to different

8
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:42,640
service or different services which offer hosting in the combined app case.

9
00:00:42,720 --> 00:00:51,180
We change our node REST API a little bit to not just be a pure REST API anymore but to also have a route

10
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:58,580
which in the end returns the react app so that we have both the backend routes the API routes and here's

11
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:06,330
do you react abroad hosted from the same or served food in the same node REST API because the react

12
00:01:06,330 --> 00:01:08,670
app simply needs a static host.

13
00:01:08,670 --> 00:01:13,410
Which is why we can deploy it on a separate server at separate machine.

14
00:01:13,410 --> 00:01:20,400
We just need some server which serves our ReACT assets which is the index HMO file the scripts and to

15
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,030
see us as follows statically no service IDE code needs to execute there.

16
00:01:25,110 --> 00:01:32,060
We don't need to execute any note J.S. code or any of our server side code to serve our ReACT assets.

17
00:01:32,060 --> 00:01:39,240
Therefore we could use a pure static host like a W.S. free firebase hosting and many other providers

18
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:40,960
for static hosting as well.

19
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,230
You can simply google for a static hosting provider and you will find many examples.

20
00:01:46,230 --> 00:01:52,980
The node REST API of course does execute code on the server and therefore we need a hosting service

21
00:01:52,980 --> 00:02:00,360
a hosting provider that is capable of executing node J.S. on the server and data from AWB as we could

22
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:06,960
use our own easy to instance which is our own virtual server which we can configure to our needs in

23
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:13,680
great detail or Elastic Beanstalk which is a service that takes a lot of configuration out of our hands

24
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,970
and makes that easier.

25
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:21,990
Or we use other providers like Heroku and again if you search for node she has hosting provider you'll

26
00:02:21,990 --> 00:02:24,540
find many many examples.

27
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:31,050
Now in the right case where we have one combined app we just need a provider which is capable of executing

28
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:37,930
notorious code because while we have an app that needs to execute no trace code and then in our no chase

29
00:02:37,950 --> 00:02:44,910
code we need to ensure that for certain requests we just return our index h him and file our ReACT scripts

30
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:51,090
and our CSO as files so we will need to tweak our notorious code for that and then just push it as one

31
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:53,840
app onto some server.

32
00:02:53,910 --> 00:02:56,610
Now I will show you examples for both.

33
00:02:56,610 --> 00:03:03,600
One important difference we all will have to adjust in our code is dead when we deploy two separate

34
00:03:03,600 --> 00:03:04,480
separated apps.

35
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,280
We essentially have to set up we had during development right.

36
00:03:07,290 --> 00:03:12,450
We had local host three thousand four to react app and local those five thousand for the node app.

37
00:03:12,510 --> 00:03:14,600
So there are no changes are required.

38
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:20,540
And for example we need to set these course headers you learned about now if you have one combined app.

39
00:03:20,550 --> 00:03:24,900
We need to change something because that's not the setup we used during this course.

40
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:30,210
And then for example we could get rid of the course headers because we would be serving everything from

41
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:35,580
the same domain and therefore the browser wouldn't need these headers to know that access is allowed

42
00:03:35,580 --> 00:03:36,440
to the API.

43
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,930
Because the API would sit on the exact same machine and domain as the front end does now let's have

44
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:47,550
a look at both options and let's start with deploying two separate apps.
