1
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:03,880
Where do we delete the place.

2
00:00:03,880 --> 00:00:08,370
Well that happens in place item in place item we get this delete button.

3
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:13,360
So here is where we have to to work on to make sure something happens when we press that button.

4
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:16,570
Now the question is what should happen when we press it.

5
00:00:16,660 --> 00:00:24,040
And my idea is that we open a modal that asks the user whether he or she is sure if you want to proceed

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,700
so that you have a chance of canceling the deletion process.

7
00:00:27,850 --> 00:00:34,120
And only if you then click yes in that modal we will later then once we have a back and send the request

8
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:37,090
to the back end to delete this.

9
00:00:37,090 --> 00:00:38,620
So let's add such a mode.

10
00:00:38,620 --> 00:00:40,420
We already do have one modal here.

11
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,380
That's the model for the map.

12
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:46,750
I will simply add a second modal because we will only render one of the two at a time.

13
00:00:46,780 --> 00:00:52,270
I will add a second modal next to it where I want to render it is this question whoever you really want

14
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:53,810
to delete it or not.

15
00:00:53,860 --> 00:01:00,760
So the content of this modal is a paragraph let's say where we say do you want to proceed and delete

16
00:01:00,820 --> 00:01:08,740
this place please note that that it can't be undone there.

17
00:01:08,830 --> 00:01:14,200
After so some warning like this now we need to configure that modal as well.

18
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:27,050
I will add a header here where I say Are you sure and footer clause of place stash item underscore underscore

19
00:01:27,080 --> 00:01:31,440
modal dash actions to nicely position my buttons in the footer.

20
00:01:31,490 --> 00:01:36,980
And speaking of that I will add footer and there I want to have some J as X which is rendered in the

21
00:01:36,980 --> 00:01:43,240
footer off the modal and that should be two buttons one to proceed and one to cancel.

22
00:01:43,550 --> 00:01:47,550
So therefore yea I will have Q Jay as X elements next to each other.

23
00:01:47,630 --> 00:01:54,700
That is not possible you need one root element in any place where you basically create a brand new J

24
00:01:54,700 --> 00:02:01,070
as X branch and therefore here I will use react fragment and in there then have my buttons.

25
00:02:01,070 --> 00:02:10,100
So the first button gets this inverse style here and I will say cancel there the second button gets

26
00:02:10,100 --> 00:02:19,210
the danger style and there I will say delete so desist and really when we will delete the item.

27
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:20,670
So now we need to wire things up.

28
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,590
We need a couple of functions to handle our different states and of course therefore we also need some

29
00:02:26,590 --> 00:02:28,150
state itself.

30
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:35,830
So let's add new state here and that is basically D the state that manages Weber we show debt confirm

31
00:02:35,860 --> 00:02:48,030
modal or not so we could named as show confirm modal and set show confirm modal is then our update function.

32
00:02:48,030 --> 00:02:53,400
And here with use state we initialize this to false because initially of course we don't show this modal

33
00:02:54,110 --> 00:03:03,990
and then we need some functions we need to show delete warning handler which has the single responsibility

34
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:16,280
of calling set show confirm model and setting this to true then I want to have my cancel delete handler.

35
00:03:16,630 --> 00:03:27,000
This has the responsibility of setting show confirm modal to false and of course we'll have to confirm

36
00:03:27,240 --> 00:03:33,000
the lead handler datas where we then really will go ahead and delete displays place and again that is

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,690
something we can't do right now.

38
00:03:34,770 --> 00:03:40,440
But for now I'll just log deleting here so that we can still see that this was triggered.

39
00:03:40,440 --> 00:03:44,580
Now we need to wire up these different functions and also use our state.

40
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:51,970
Let's start with the state on the model here I will set the show prop which controls whether the model

41
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:56,750
is shown or not to show confirm model.

42
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:05,370
That state we just added an on cancel will be set to to cancel the lead handler of course the same forward

43
00:04:05,370 --> 00:04:14,290
as cancelled button on click here will simply trigger the cancel delete handler on the other hand on

44
00:04:14,290 --> 00:04:20,500
click on this button here on the delete button in the model will trigger to confirm delete handler.

45
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:25,980
And now we need to wire up that delete button at the very bottom there of course upon a click.

46
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,520
I want to show my confirm modal node.

47
00:04:30,540 --> 00:04:32,180
That's the wrong thing.

48
00:04:32,180 --> 00:04:36,680
Show delete warning handler is the functioning that should be triggered here.

49
00:04:36,750 --> 00:04:41,970
With that if we safeties if I click delete we see that modal figure cancel it gets closed if I click

50
00:04:41,970 --> 00:04:44,400
here it gets closed if I click delete here.

51
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,610
Of course nothing happens but I see deleting.

52
00:04:46,770 --> 00:04:49,740
I want to close my model in that case as well though.

53
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:56,250
So in here in the confirmed delete handler we should also set show stats show confirm modal to faults

54
00:04:56,250 --> 00:04:57,550
too close to modal.

55
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,060
So with that if we now click delete and click delete here we would really send the request to delete

56
00:05:03,060 --> 00:05:04,430
it and we will do so later.

57
00:05:04,440 --> 00:05:07,780
And for the moment we just close the model and print this.

58
00:05:07,980 --> 00:05:12,720
So that's all the working the real magic will happen later but it's a good start.

59
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,600
And with that let's work on authenticate and make sure that there we all also show a form we can even

60
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:20,290
switch between two modes.

61
00:05:20,310 --> 00:05:25,140
Log in and sign up mode and we at least gather the user input for now.
