00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:07.140
So let's implement image upload when we add a new place for this on the front end.

2
00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:10.440
Let's go to the new place component.

3
00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:14.910
And there we need to first of all import our image upload component.

4
00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.220
So image upload from shared components form elements.

5
00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:21.940
Image upload.

6
00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:30.470
Now we can add this to the form there so here in our J is X code may be below the address here we can

7
00:00:30.470 --> 00:00:32.260
add image upload.

8
00:00:32.330 --> 00:00:38.000
Now of course this now is input which is always rendered unlike in these sign up form we don't switch

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:39.890
between different modes here.

10
00:00:40.070 --> 00:00:47.540
The idea can be image and should be image to map this to our fourth estate later and on input here is

11
00:00:47.540 --> 00:00:53.740
bound to our input handler the error text which we can provide can be.

12
00:00:53.820 --> 00:00:59.790
Please provide an image though I didn't do that on the sign up form actually.

13
00:00:59.790 --> 00:01:05.850
So let me quickly go back there and on the off page on image upload.

14
00:01:06.180 --> 00:01:08.810
I will add that same error text here.

15
00:01:08.940 --> 00:01:12.570
So here on image upload I will also add this error text.

16
00:01:12.570 --> 00:01:14.090
This is in the off page now.

17
00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:20.790
A little oversight back then but normally this contrary be invalid so back to NEW PLACE.

18
00:01:20.870 --> 00:01:22.010
WE GOT OUR image upload.

19
00:01:22.010 --> 00:01:23.210
Edit there as well.

20
00:01:23.210 --> 00:01:25.120
Now let's add it to our form state.

21
00:01:25.670 --> 00:01:34.000
So here when we initialize our form I add the image key so the I.D. we used and J as X as well and set

22
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:41.920
the value to null initially and is valid to false this key here of course has to match the I.D. we have

23
00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:44.490
down there.

24
00:01:44.500 --> 00:01:49.570
So with that we should have an image upload feud there as well and it should be part of the forum data

25
00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.270
if we now send the request.

26
00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:56.800
We of course need to send form data they offer.

27
00:01:56.870 --> 00:02:05.960
So let's add our forum data here with new forum data and append the different data pieces we have.

28
00:02:05.960 --> 00:02:13.010
So the title for example which of course is retrieved like this from our forum state and then we repeat

29
00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:15.460
this for the description.

30
00:02:17.060 --> 00:02:24.050
Like this we repeat this for the address and for the moment we all need to add our Creator here.

31
00:02:24.050 --> 00:02:30.110
We don't get the creator from the former state though but from of user I.D. once we have authentication

32
00:02:30.130 --> 00:02:30.980
this will change.

33
00:02:30.980 --> 00:02:38.830
By the way now we need one more input one more form data piece and that is our image.

34
00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:44.240
And this has to be image because we will retrieve despite his image key later on the back end.

35
00:02:44.260 --> 00:02:47.000
Right now I haven't added logic to do so though.

36
00:02:47.460 --> 00:02:51.510
But for the moment let's stick to the front and let's store the image here in the image key and of course

37
00:02:51.510 --> 00:02:53.230
refer to image here.

38
00:02:53.240 --> 00:03:01.270
Therefore so now here we can remove the body and the headers and just add forum data to our request

39
00:03:01.280 --> 00:03:06.790
we're sending so this should send a correctly configured request.

40
00:03:06.910 --> 00:03:12.880
But now we all need to work on the back end for one in the places roots just as we did it into users

41
00:03:12.940 --> 00:03:13.690
roots.

42
00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.360
We need to add this middleware here.

43
00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:27.350
So in places roots let's add a import and import the file upload middleware from require middleware

44
00:03:27.500 --> 00:03:29.930
file upload or actually as you learn.

45
00:03:29.930 --> 00:03:31.720
This is not already the middleware.

46
00:03:31.730 --> 00:03:36.860
It's the object with a bunch of millionaires and we get the right middleware by for example calling

47
00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:37.970
single.

48
00:03:37.970 --> 00:03:44.570
So here on this post request I will call file upload single and look for the image in a key in the body

49
00:03:44.570 --> 00:03:51.870
which is named image so is Dad we're extracting the image upon the creation of a new place as well.

50
00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:54.570
Now in the place controller we have to handle it.

51
00:03:54.720 --> 00:03:58.880
We have to roll back logic and app J.S. and our global error handler.

52
00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:00.600
So Daniel already work.

53
00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:06.600
We don't need to add anything there but in the places controller I of course now also want to link the

54
00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.180
image to a newly created place.

55
00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:16.750
So in create plays we're extracting the other data from the request body which is fine but then here

56
00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:20.870
when we create our place the image is no longer a U or L like this.

57
00:04:21.090 --> 00:04:27.110
Instead here I will use request file path just like this.

58
00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:33.800
This is now what gets stored in my newly created place and now we just have to go back to the front

59
00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.480
end again and make sure that we output or use the right you are all there.

60
00:04:38.540 --> 00:04:47.060
So on place item where I render the image of a place I will wrap this here into backtracks and then

61
00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.570
output local host five thousand and then dynamically output props.

62
00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:54.000
Image in there.

63
00:04:54.020 --> 00:04:58.910
So did we use the path which is stored on the back end and connect us with our you are Eldad that points

64
00:04:58.910 --> 00:05:06.990
at the back end with all of that let's save it and let's give it a try let's log in here with the user

65
00:05:06.990 --> 00:05:19.770
recreate it and add a place Marine plots a great place in Munich the address Marine plots one in Munich

66
00:05:20.700 --> 00:05:25.280
and pick an image and here I prepared an image for me already which is up.

67
00:05:25.290 --> 00:05:33.000
Picture of the Marine plots and now if you click Add place does loads we are redirected we got one place

68
00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.770
and here it is this is our image of the Marine plots.

69
00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:42.740
Now if I added this this all looks really really nice.

70
00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:49.790
Editing is reflected here we can view it on a map and we got our image here and on the back and unsurprisingly

71
00:05:49.790 --> 00:05:57.170
if we go to images then we see our user image which we uploaded earlier and that image I just chose.

72
00:05:57.380 --> 00:06:06.020
So upload is working here and with that we're able to upload images for both users as well as places.
