00:00:02.090 --> 00:00:07.380
Our goal is that you get the best possible learning experience whilst following along this course.

2
00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.140
So how can you get the most out of it.

3
00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.910
Well first watch the videos.

4
00:00:10.940 --> 00:00:11.660
Sounds easy.

5
00:00:11.660 --> 00:00:13.250
It's an on demand video course Indian.

6
00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:17.690
But it's important to watch the videos and to also watch the videos at your speed.

7
00:00:17.690 --> 00:00:22.430
You can adjust the playback speed in you Jimmy video player so make sure to use this feature to watch

8
00:00:22.430 --> 00:00:27.740
the Course videos conveniently watching the videos is nice but also cold along.

9
00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:30.940
This is a very crucial part of the learning process.

10
00:00:31.130 --> 00:00:37.190
The whole course is interactive so take the chance code a long and important pause and rewind don't

11
00:00:37.190 --> 00:00:42.470
just code along and don't understand what type of call you're writing and why you're writing it in case

12
00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:43.400
something is unclear.

13
00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:48.260
Pause and rewind watch the lecture again until you really understand what you're doing here and why

14
00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:49.080
you're doing it.

15
00:00:49.190 --> 00:00:55.400
Besides coding along practice is of course something that we highly recommend following along the course

16
00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.170
is great and you learn all the core things you need to create your own Moon's tech applications in this

17
00:01:00.170 --> 00:01:06.980
course but you should advance on your own create your own projects or enhance the course project according

18
00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:07.870
to your needs.

19
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:10.470
These are all things that will help you in the long term.

20
00:01:10.510 --> 00:01:11.900
Practice play around.

21
00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:14.770
And with that become a Marine stack master.

22
00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:19.630
Now on the way to become a master debugging and searching is also something that will happen to you.

23
00:01:19.640 --> 00:01:21.650
Things can go wrong than writing code.

24
00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:24.590
This is also a crucial part of the learning process in the end.

25
00:01:24.770 --> 00:01:30.180
But it's important to have the right approach for debugging the code and for searching for solutions.

26
00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:35.260
For that you can find the use code attached to the last lecture of each module in the course.

27
00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:36.380
So in case you're stuck.

28
00:01:36.380 --> 00:01:39.230
Make sure to download this code and compare it to your code.

29
00:01:39.230 --> 00:01:40.830
You might have a tiny little mistake.

30
00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:44.750
And with that approach you can quickly find it and continue with the course.

31
00:01:44.810 --> 00:01:48.190
Also Google in case you have any kind of error message.

32
00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:51.930
Chances are that if you have this problem another person had this problem to you.

33
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.010
And with that a solution can be found quickly by a Google besides Google.

34
00:01:57.020 --> 00:02:00.240
You can also use the integrated UDP search function.

35
00:02:00.290 --> 00:02:01.610
That's also very helpful.

36
00:02:01.610 --> 00:02:06.860
With that you can search through the course content and you can also search fraud the Cuban a section

37
00:02:06.980 --> 00:02:11.170
because that's the last important step to make sure you get the most out of this course.

38
00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:16.640
Ask and answer questions in case you're stuck and you can continue to ask in the June section of the

39
00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.830
course and we do our best to help you as quick as possible.

40
00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:25.700
But in addition to asking it's also important to answer questions because answering is so much more

41
00:02:25.700 --> 00:02:26.440
rewarding.

42
00:02:26.450 --> 00:02:29.270
Asking is is your right but answering and helping others.

43
00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:31.580
This is really great because nothing can go wrong here.

44
00:02:31.700 --> 00:02:36.320
If you give a wrong answer somebody will correct you and you will learn or if you gave the right answer

45
00:02:36.530 --> 00:02:40.940
you practice your knowledge and the person who asked the question gets an answer.

46
00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.910
And that's basically a win win situation for everyone.

47
00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:50.360
Now if that you are well prepared for the course and this means we cannot dive into the course and continue

48
00:02:50.420 --> 00:02:52.250
with the moron stack inferior now.
