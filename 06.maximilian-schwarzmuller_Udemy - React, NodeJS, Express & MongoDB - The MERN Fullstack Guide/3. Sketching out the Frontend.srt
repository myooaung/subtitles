1
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:05,260
So let's now have a look at the design sketching part.

2
00:00:05,260 --> 00:00:10,170
And as I mentioned we'll not worry too much about the design when it comes to picking color lessons

3
00:00:10,180 --> 00:00:11,100
on there.

4
00:00:11,100 --> 00:00:13,140
I will just provide you with some colors.

5
00:00:13,150 --> 00:00:15,640
I came up with an advance instead here.

6
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:20,440
I now want to focus on sketching out the front end of this application.

7
00:00:20,440 --> 00:00:28,500
So how this app should roughly feel how the pages are connected what should be visible on the user interface.

8
00:00:28,600 --> 00:00:33,850
For that you can now have a look at my amazing drawing skills not.

9
00:00:34,150 --> 00:00:36,990
But I hope it will still be helpful.

10
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:41,800
So what do we have in the front end of this application.

11
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:43,950
Well it all starts with a page.

12
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:44,820
We're visiting.

13
00:00:44,890 --> 00:00:48,060
And by the way I'm drawing the desktop view here.

14
00:00:48,090 --> 00:00:52,390
We'll also build this application such that it looks and works great on mobile.

15
00:00:52,390 --> 00:00:55,110
But here I'm just sketching out the desktop view.

16
00:00:55,630 --> 00:01:02,860
So we'll start on that page where we probably want to have a header with some title of our applications

17
00:01:02,860 --> 00:01:05,470
or the name of the app our brand.

18
00:01:05,470 --> 00:01:06,790
Something like this.

19
00:01:07,030 --> 00:01:11,970
And then also some menu items on the other end of our header here.

20
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:13,750
Now I'll come back to these menu items.

21
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:17,110
Let's think about what we see on the starting screen there.

22
00:01:17,110 --> 00:01:19,400
I want to have a list of users.

23
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:25,900
So a couple of list items at the end which simply are rendered beneath each other where for every user

24
00:01:25,930 --> 00:01:32,110
we have like an image of that user the name like Max or menu.

25
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:34,270
And then the number of places off that user.

26
00:01:34,270 --> 00:01:36,450
So the number of places that user shared.

27
00:01:36,580 --> 00:01:39,780
So maybe here I shared two places.

28
00:01:39,820 --> 00:01:45,720
And man you shared one place let's say and of course we have more users here.

29
00:01:45,850 --> 00:01:48,270
So that's the starting screen now.

30
00:01:48,460 --> 00:01:52,890
When we tap a user something should happen before we think about that though.

31
00:01:52,990 --> 00:02:00,730
Let's talk about the menu items I want to have in the header there it depends on whether we are authenticated

32
00:02:00,820 --> 00:02:12,670
or not if we are not authenticated then here in the header I want to have an authenticate option here

33
00:02:12,670 --> 00:02:14,060
I'll just name it off.

34
00:02:14,110 --> 00:02:15,130
You could name it log in.

35
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:22,960
So basically option which we can tap to be taken to the off indication screen if we are authenticated

36
00:02:23,770 --> 00:02:27,610
then here I want to have the option to create a new place.

37
00:02:27,700 --> 00:02:32,700
So to be taken to a screen where we can simply well create a new place.

38
00:02:32,930 --> 00:02:35,950
I also want to have option which should always be available.

39
00:02:36,070 --> 00:02:38,950
And that's basically the the users list.

40
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,830
So this SQL starting screen here that should always be available no matter if we are logged in or not.

41
00:02:44,830 --> 00:02:51,730
We could also say that this option when we tap this is basically all happening if we tap the title because

42
00:02:51,730 --> 00:02:53,950
Stead is our starting screen of the app.

43
00:02:53,950 --> 00:03:00,610
So these two options here are basically equivalent we could say I think that would be a setup which

44
00:03:00,610 --> 00:03:01,630
should generally work.

45
00:03:01,630 --> 00:03:09,940
But now let's see what happens when we tap a user here so when we click our user here like menu then

46
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:12,740
I want to be taken to a new page.

47
00:03:12,820 --> 00:03:19,180
Now on that new page here which is loaded of course we have the same header as before with the title

48
00:03:19,270 --> 00:03:24,160
and with our different menu options here not going to write them out again.

49
00:03:24,160 --> 00:03:27,110
These are the same options as you see up there.

50
00:03:27,130 --> 00:03:30,190
So instead let's focus on the main area off this page.

51
00:03:30,190 --> 00:03:31,780
What do we see there.

52
00:03:31,780 --> 00:03:34,410
Well man you has one place right.

53
00:03:34,420 --> 00:03:35,830
And he has one place.

54
00:03:35,830 --> 00:03:43,060
So here I expect to see that one place if he had more places than I would expect to see a list of these

55
00:03:43,060 --> 00:03:43,780
places here.

56
00:03:43,780 --> 00:03:49,580
Now that place should have an image and we'll see how exactly we create this.

57
00:03:49,630 --> 00:03:56,830
We could have the image at the top here for example then the title and then also options that allow

58
00:03:56,830 --> 00:03:58,460
us to interact with that place.

59
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:04,360
For example we can have a few on map button here.

60
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:11,800
The idea is that when we click this or when we tap on this option we open up this place or the location

61
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:13,830
of this place in a motel.

62
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:20,520
So in an overlay to the screen where we can see that place marked with the help of Google Maps.

63
00:04:20,710 --> 00:04:28,180
In addition I want to have two other buttons on the right here and edit and delete button which we always

64
00:04:28,180 --> 00:04:31,910
see if we are the creator of that place.

65
00:04:31,930 --> 00:04:36,550
So that's only visible if creators.

66
00:04:36,550 --> 00:04:38,380
So if the menu in this case.

67
00:04:38,380 --> 00:04:43,200
So if they're locked in user who is viewing this screen is all to the creator of the place.

68
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:47,320
Otherwise only the view on map button is visible.

69
00:04:47,320 --> 00:04:55,890
Now when we tap that view on map button as I said I want to open an overlay which has a map.

70
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:01,970
So which uses Google Maps to display the place on the map with a marker.

71
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,760
That's the idea.

72
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:07,250
What should happen when we tap this view on map button.

73
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:11,930
So this is roughly how that could look like we might all add a description so that we have the title

74
00:05:11,930 --> 00:05:12,950
and description here.

75
00:05:13,010 --> 00:05:14,730
But that's my general idea.

76
00:05:14,750 --> 00:05:20,120
The idea is not that we can tap this place to be taken to a new screen where we then view all the details

77
00:05:20,480 --> 00:05:25,800
but that we can see all details or reach them like in the case of the map from this screen.

78
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:28,320
But of course that is something you could build differently.

79
00:05:28,340 --> 00:05:30,680
It's just the approach I want to go with here.

80
00:05:31,580 --> 00:05:31,770
OK.

81
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:38,690
So that is our list of places where we can all of you Place details we get there from our list of users

82
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,270
because every place is mapped to a user.

83
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:44,990
So we have to tap a user first before we can see the places.

84
00:05:44,990 --> 00:05:47,820
Now what about these other buttons we have there.

85
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,040
The off button and the new button up there.

86
00:05:50,570 --> 00:05:53,820
Well let's start with the off button.

87
00:05:53,990 --> 00:06:00,200
When we pressed is off button I of course again when I have my header up there with the same menu options

88
00:06:00,200 --> 00:06:01,350
we saw before.

89
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:13,150
But then here I want to have a form where the user has to enter some data namely the e-mail the password

90
00:06:13,420 --> 00:06:15,750
and also any other data we might need.

91
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:23,770
For example also button which allows us to pick and emissions on this all should be here and then we

92
00:06:23,770 --> 00:06:33,810
need a button which allows us to log in or also switched a log in mode so that we can basically toggle

93
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:35,950
between log and mode and sign up mode.

94
00:06:36,090 --> 00:06:40,260
And this will all affect what we see up there.

95
00:06:40,260 --> 00:06:45,510
So when we're in logging mode we of course only have to enter email and password if we are in sign up

96
00:06:45,510 --> 00:06:45,780
mode.

97
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:50,010
We will also need to provide the image and the name of the user and so on.

98
00:06:50,070 --> 00:06:56,340
So let's see authentication for him which we only are able to reach if we are not authenticated yet.

99
00:06:56,340 --> 00:06:57,620
Now what about the use case.

100
00:06:57,660 --> 00:06:59,130
We are authenticated.

101
00:06:59,130 --> 00:07:07,110
Well then we can of course press this new button here in the menu and go to a new page where we also

102
00:07:07,110 --> 00:07:14,190
see the good old header but where we then can create a new place and that is very similar to the authentication

103
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:16,190
page with totally different fields.

104
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:18,110
But the idea is the same here.

105
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:21,330
We have input fields to create a new place.

106
00:07:21,390 --> 00:07:28,760
Also our image picker for the place and so on and then of course a button to add that place.

107
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:30,290
That is the general idea here.

108
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:33,790
We simply have a page which allows us to create a new place.

109
00:07:33,930 --> 00:07:40,860
Of course when we tap this Add button or when we tap the log in button down there we send the HBP request

110
00:07:40,860 --> 00:07:46,740
to the back end where we will then basically send or attach all the data we picked here in the form

111
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:53,370
and then on the back and we can extract that data and create the user create the place and so on.

112
00:07:53,370 --> 00:07:56,150
Now creating a new place is one thing.

113
00:07:56,190 --> 00:07:59,400
We also have this edit button here right.

114
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:06,820
So when we tap this we all want to go to a new screen and that should be a screen with the good old

115
00:08:06,820 --> 00:08:08,220
header we already know.

116
00:08:08,260 --> 00:08:14,710
And on that screen I also want to see a form a shorter form though where we can edit some data specifically

117
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:22,570
the title and let's say the description of a place not image and address but these two fields should

118
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:23,530
be editable here.

119
00:08:23,920 --> 00:08:30,050
So we basically have like a a shorter form off that create new place form here.

120
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:33,700
We have a will shorten form to update title and description.

121
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:35,620
This is what we could have here.

122
00:08:35,860 --> 00:08:44,860
Now when we clicked the delete button I want to open up a modal where we have to confirm the choice

123
00:08:45,340 --> 00:08:50,740
and basically have a chance to cancel the deletion process in case we click this button accidentally

124
00:08:51,710 --> 00:08:52,100
well.

125
00:08:52,140 --> 00:08:57,840
And that is my beautiful drawing which basically lays out the front and off this application.

126
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:03,810
Now I can guarantee you it will look pretty hard and what I drew here but this drawing here this skeleton

127
00:09:03,840 --> 00:09:10,320
which I sketched out here basically gives us an idea of the flow of our app and how users can navigate

128
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:11,300
through it.

129
00:09:11,340 --> 00:09:16,290
It gives us a rough first idea of the pages and components we will need there.

130
00:09:16,440 --> 00:09:23,160
And it basically helps us build the right application to write react the application for the app we

131
00:09:23,160 --> 00:09:24,320
want to build Indian.

132
00:09:25,290 --> 00:09:28,220
So that's my sketch for the front end.

133
00:09:28,290 --> 00:09:34,950
Now let's analyze which data we got in our application and which endpoints we need on the backend.
