00:00:02.130 --> 00:00:08.700
So on the front end we got a couple of pages and namely when we open the app when we just visit this

2
00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:14.190
Web site for the first time we are on my cool page dot com slash nothing.

3
00:00:14.250 --> 00:00:17.160
What should be visible on this starting page.

4
00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:20.130
Well I want to show a list of users there.

5
00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.420
So does list of users where we can click a user to then be taken to the places of that user.

6
00:00:26.430 --> 00:00:28.700
Speaking of that we need a route.

7
00:00:28.740 --> 00:00:35.300
And now these are all front end routes which are interpreted by react or to be precise.

8
00:00:35.340 --> 00:00:40.520
A library that supports routing and react and which will not be interpreted by our backend.

9
00:00:40.590 --> 00:00:46.350
So we also want to have a route data on the front end for some dynamic user I.D. which we don't know

10
00:00:46.350 --> 00:00:53.960
in advance slash places which should load all the places for debt specific selected user.

11
00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.690
I also want to have a slash authenticate or slash off route which shows us a page that holds the sign

12
00:01:00.690 --> 00:01:07.680
up and log in the forums between which we can toggle and also slash places slash new route which shows

13
00:01:07.680 --> 00:01:10.100
us a new place for it.

14
00:01:10.170 --> 00:01:17.860
In addition we need a slash places slash someplace idea route which leads us to the page where we the

15
00:01:17.970 --> 00:01:23.090
update place forums so where we can enter the new data forest select a place.

16
00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:27.420
Now on the front it's not all pages are visible all the time.

17
00:01:27.420 --> 00:01:32.690
The list of users is always reachable and so is the list of places for a selected user.

18
00:01:32.730 --> 00:01:39.330
These are always reachable no matter if we the visitor off this page are logged in or not.

19
00:01:39.330 --> 00:01:45.330
The only difference is that when we're reviewing the list of places one we're not locked in or if we

20
00:01:45.390 --> 00:01:51.720
are logged in but we didn't create the places we're looking at will not see the edit and delete buttons

21
00:01:51.810 --> 00:01:55.020
will only see those if we are logged in.

22
00:01:55.020 --> 00:01:57.840
And where do creator of a given place.

23
00:01:58.170 --> 00:02:04.950
Now if we are trying to authenticate this page should only be reachable if we're currently not authenticated

24
00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:10.060
because if we are authenticated it makes no sense to try to log in again.

25
00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:13.290
We already are logged in after all.

26
00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:16.690
Now for a new place and up that place it's the opposite.

27
00:02:16.740 --> 00:02:23.420
These pages these front end routes should only be reachable by users who are authenticated.

28
00:02:23.430 --> 00:02:30.390
So who did log in or who did just sign up and these will be our front and pages.

29
00:02:30.430 --> 00:02:35.110
Now you don't need to memorize all of what we walked through in this module.

30
00:02:35.110 --> 00:02:40.230
Instead I hope that this module just helps you plan your next project.

31
00:02:40.270 --> 00:02:46.780
We will now go ahead and implement all these different things step by step into different modules of

32
00:02:46.810 --> 00:02:48.070
this course.

33
00:02:48.070 --> 00:02:50.440
This is just our general agenda.

34
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.400
And with that we're well-prepared to start working on the real code.
