00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:03.810
And that's it for this module.

2
00:00:03.860 --> 00:00:07.850
We built our first little REST API with node and express.

3
00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:13.850
We added our middleware functions here as controllers in the separate file and we're mapping this to

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:19.790
incoming requests here in the roots file where we listen for different HP methods and different paths

5
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:22.680
and then execute different middleware functions.

6
00:00:22.700 --> 00:00:29.240
You'll learned how to add validation how to set up your rules and how to then work with validation errors

7
00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.910
and possibly send back errors.

8
00:00:31.910 --> 00:00:37.790
We created our own error model for that and we're using the default express tray as our handling middleware

9
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.360
to send back a standard uniform error message.

10
00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.720
If something goes wrong in general you learned how to work with Express and node and how to work with

11
00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:55.010
that middleware concept of express how to parse request data and also of course how to map your different

12
00:00:55.010 --> 00:00:57.300
routes to different filters here.

13
00:00:57.350 --> 00:01:01.970
That really is a lot of new things or a lot of useful things.

14
00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:05.450
And that is what makes up any REST API you build.

15
00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:07.370
Now of course there are missing pieces.

16
00:01:07.370 --> 00:01:13.340
We're not talking to a database yet that will happen later and we don't have a real user authentication

17
00:01:13.340 --> 00:01:13.580
flow.

18
00:01:13.580 --> 00:01:16.290
We're just doing some dummy authentication here.

19
00:01:16.310 --> 00:01:22.460
Now of course that will all be added but we're done with the first step towards a real REST API and

20
00:01:22.460 --> 00:01:25.040
therefore we can now move on to the next steps.
