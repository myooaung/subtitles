00:00:02.220 --> 00:00:07.230
Let's work on the user item as well and let's ensure that we output something for every user.

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:12.470
We're getting a bunch of user data passed into user item I.D. Image Name so on.

3
00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.190
So let's make sure we use that.

4
00:00:14.190 --> 00:00:20.130
So any user item component of course is again all about returning J is X code and I'm using parentheses

5
00:00:20.130 --> 00:00:26.480
here so that I can conveniently write multi line J is X code every user should it be a list item in

6
00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:29.030
the end here because it's inside of an unordered list.

7
00:00:29.060 --> 00:00:31.810
It's good semantics to use a list item here.

8
00:00:31.970 --> 00:00:36.590
Now we'll add a class name of user item to every list item here.

9
00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:43.850
And by the way on the users list I will always add a class name to the unordered list of users list.

10
00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:49.710
Does will make sure to add later to styling works properly and with that back to user item.

11
00:00:49.730 --> 00:00:54.560
So here we have a list item for every user in there.

12
00:00:54.570 --> 00:01:02.130
I'll add a death and on the div I'll add another class name user dash item underscore underscore content.

13
00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:03.950
Make sure you get these class names right.

14
00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:09.270
Because I will provide the finished C as s code to you and to see us as code of course will be fine

15
00:01:09.270 --> 00:01:11.270
tuned for these class names later.

16
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.190
I don't want to bore you with writing our own code which is why I will give you the finished one inside

17
00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.640
of that div here.

18
00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:26.140
I won't have the number div with a class name of user dash item underscore underscore image and in debt.

19
00:01:26.150 --> 00:01:35.940
Div we can then render an image self closing tag where the source simply is prop stored image because

20
00:01:35.940 --> 00:01:43.620
that is d key under which we received that image you are L I will also provide a ALD tag here and that

21
00:01:43.620 --> 00:01:51.950
will just be props stored name which is the property under which we received a name of the user.

22
00:01:51.950 --> 00:01:57.710
Now let's add a number diff next to that first div which holds the image and on that.

23
00:01:57.720 --> 00:02:04.310
I'll add a class name of user dash item underscore underscore info and in that Def year I then went

24
00:02:04.310 --> 00:02:14.150
to have a h to tag where I output the user name in curly braces proper name and age free tag where I'll

25
00:02:14.210 --> 00:02:21.260
output prop stored place count which is that name of the proper I get the number of places does user

26
00:02:21.260 --> 00:02:29.930
create it and then also after debt in a new expression in New curly braces I'll check if proper place

27
00:02:29.930 --> 00:02:38.780
count is equal to 1 and if it is with a ternary expression here I'll say place otherwise I'll say places

28
00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:45.510
simply to have to write plural form depending on whether we have one place or a 0 2 3 4 5 places and

29
00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:50.360
so on and that can be as simple basic user item.

30
00:02:50.430 --> 00:02:58.600
Now if we save everything and we have a look at this by going back to slash nothing we see something

31
00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:04.450
this is not really styled in a good way because I haven't added any styling yet but we see something

32
00:03:04.750 --> 00:03:06.370
we see our confit here.

33
00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:14.320
Now let's all to quickly validate that we see the no users found text if we have no users by temporarily

34
00:03:14.500 --> 00:03:21.010
commenting out the single user we have in our users array we now save that we see no users found and

35
00:03:21.010 --> 00:03:26.650
again don't be irritated by this grayish background will soon change this.

36
00:03:26.770 --> 00:03:33.820
So this now generally works but of course styling is totally off now therefore in the next lecture let's

37
00:03:33.820 --> 00:03:39.400
make sure we work on the styling and the general presentation of our data and our components.
