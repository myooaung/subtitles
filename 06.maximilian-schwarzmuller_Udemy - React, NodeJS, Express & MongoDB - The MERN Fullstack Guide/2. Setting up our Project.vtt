00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:08.430
I'm in a brand new project so simply an empty folder which I opened here in visual pseudocode.

2
00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.610
And since I want to set up a node and express app here I will first of all make sure that this project

3
00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.970
can be managed with the help of NPM with that tool that allows us to install third party dependency

4
00:00:20.970 --> 00:00:21.940
centers on.

5
00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:27.960
For that let's open up a new terminal which automatically is navigated into this project folder here.

6
00:00:27.990 --> 00:00:34.080
This integrated terminal and let's run NPM in it's there as you learned.

7
00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:40.140
This asks you a couple of questions which you can all answer with the default by hitting enter and it

8
00:00:40.140 --> 00:00:45.960
will then generate this package started Jason File which will manage all the dependencies and which

9
00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:52.260
allows you to register some scripts with that let's install some dependencies.

10
00:00:52.260 --> 00:00:59.820
Specifically I want to install Express and body parser as production so as code dependencies with dash

11
00:00:59.820 --> 00:01:05.060
dash save because I will use these dependencies in the code we write.

12
00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:11.160
Let's install these packages so that we can set up an express app and can also parse the bodies of incoming

13
00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:12.630
requests.

14
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:19.150
I will also install whenever a dependency with dash dash save dash def and that's Node 1.

15
00:01:19.170 --> 00:01:26.160
This was this extra tool which makes sure that we automatically restart our server whenever we change

16
00:01:26.160 --> 00:01:27.600
some server side code.

17
00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:33.480
This simply speeds up the development process because we don't have to manually quit and restart the

18
00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:34.970
server.

19
00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:43.040
And with that I'll add a new file here I'll add app J.S. file you could name it server J.S. as we did

20
00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:45.010
it in the refresher module here.

21
00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:48.470
I will name it app yes it serves the same purpose.

22
00:01:48.490 --> 00:01:50.710
It's our main entry file.

23
00:01:50.990 --> 00:01:57.730
Therefore here in package dot Jason I will add a new script the start script and as a command there

24
00:01:57.790 --> 00:02:04.840
I will use node mourn and point at the capture as file so that when we run NPM start node 1 we'll use

25
00:02:04.840 --> 00:02:11.710
node to execute this aptly as file and it will also watch all files in this project directory and whenever

26
00:02:11.770 --> 00:02:16.540
any file changes it will automatically restart the server at the moment.

27
00:02:16.540 --> 00:02:22.000
Though there is no server to start because the aptly is file is totally empty of course.

28
00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.040
So let's get started with that and let's set up a basic node express application there.
