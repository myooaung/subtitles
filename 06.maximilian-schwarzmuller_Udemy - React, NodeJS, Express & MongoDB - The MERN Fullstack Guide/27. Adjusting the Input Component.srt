00:00:02,620 --> 00:00:08,130
In the input component we need to be able to work with initial values and validity.

2
00:00:08,620 --> 00:00:11,170
So Indian component here.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:14,350
Value is not always an empty string.

4
00:00:14,350 --> 00:00:17,400
It also can be a value provided from outside.

5
00:00:17,410 --> 00:00:18,660
So here props.

6
00:00:18,700 --> 00:00:23,110
Value could be something we set as the initial value or an empty string.

7
00:00:23,260 --> 00:00:28,120
If the value prop is not provided and for is valid it's the same we set this to props.

8
00:00:28,150 --> 00:00:32,130
Valid or false if that's not provided.

9
00:00:32,170 --> 00:00:39,910
So this is one important adjustment here to work with initial values and support does as well.

10
00:00:39,930 --> 00:00:40,910
Let's see if that works.

11
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,710
If we save this and we click on edit here we're taking to this forum and this form looks horrible because

12
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:50,600
the form styling is missing all fixed as soon.

13
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,830
But if I now have a look at this the button is disabled and that makes sense because an update place

14
00:00:55,860 --> 00:00:58,200
we currently always disable it.

15
00:00:58,200 --> 00:01:01,640
But let's see if I get an error if I now remove that initial value by the way.

16
00:01:01,650 --> 00:01:06,370
The fact that we see this initial value here already shows us that our input seems to work.

17
00:01:06,480 --> 00:01:08,670
And yeah if I remove it we get an error.

18
00:01:08,730 --> 00:01:12,070
If I add a valid input back we get nowhere.

19
00:01:12,120 --> 00:01:13,300
So that is looking good.

20
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:14,950
That seems to work now.

21
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:19,250
Of course the overall forum is not looking that great there.

22
00:01:19,260 --> 00:01:26,240
I actually want to use the same styling as a new place and therefore I will named as place forum CSX

23
00:01:26,250 --> 00:01:34,620
here and the new place J.S. import plays form CSX and import the same here in update place so that I

24
00:01:34,620 --> 00:01:42,180
can reuse this styling does of course means that an update plays to the form we should add this class

25
00:01:42,180 --> 00:01:48,150
name of placed dash form so that the styling applies there too.

26
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:50,490
And with that that looks a lot nicer.

27
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:51,850
So that's good.

28
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:55,440
So our input component seems to work and the form is looking good.

29
00:01:55,590 --> 00:01:58,500
But now what about the forum state itself.

30
00:01:58,500 --> 00:02:02,760
What about this forum reducer and all the logic we wrote in new place.

31
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:07,300
A lot of that logic is required here as well but not all the logic.

32
00:02:07,350 --> 00:02:10,760
For example the initial state is a different one.

33
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:19,300
Here we have title and description and we should also have address and an update place.

34
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,500
We only need title and description and we don't need address.

35
00:02:23,500 --> 00:02:30,760
So how can we kind of reuse that and still make it configurable from inside each component.

36
00:02:30,760 --> 00:02:33,250
For that we can create a custom hook.

37
00:02:33,250 --> 00:02:36,340
Something we haven't done yet but which you will do now.
