1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:04,690
This is react in a nutshell.

2
00:00:04,690 --> 00:00:09,970
No there is way way more to react and we'll see way way more.

3
00:00:09,990 --> 00:00:16,230
Our course project where we will build an entire app with react where we will also add routing and do

4
00:00:16,230 --> 00:00:18,940
more complex user input management and so on.

5
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,520
But for does refresher we learn everything we need.

6
00:00:22,770 --> 00:00:29,130
Now as I mentioned multiple times really also take some dedicated react resources no matter if that's

7
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,390
my complete guide course or the official box or any other tutorial.

8
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:39,870
If you are serious about react this course has not the goal of teaching you react from the ground up.

9
00:00:39,870 --> 00:00:45,330
I do explain a lot to ensure that we're all on the same page and I will explain every feature we add

10
00:00:45,330 --> 00:00:46,440
for all this course.

11
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:54,000
But in dedicated resources you simply get a way deeper and better insight into react into all its features

12
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,830
including features which we don't need in this course and how it works under the hood.

13
00:00:58,830 --> 00:01:03,130
So that's my strong recommendation from this refresher.

14
00:01:03,130 --> 00:01:08,860
The most important takeaway is that you understand that React is all about components that components

15
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:15,010
are functions that return J as X or JavaScript classes with a render method which we don't use here

16
00:01:15,020 --> 00:01:22,260
though that components can receive props to receive data from parent components that props can also

17
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:29,080
receive functions pointers at functions so that the child component the component used in a natural

18
00:01:29,080 --> 00:01:35,530
component can communicate back to its parent component so to the component using it and that you have

19
00:01:35,530 --> 00:01:42,280
this very important concept of state which allows you to manage data that when changed with one of the

20
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:49,270
state updating functions actually causes react re rendered a component and re rendered to J as X code

21
00:01:49,450 --> 00:01:52,660
and re-evaluate what needs to be output on the screen.

22
00:01:52,660 --> 00:01:58,500
This is what allows you to render dynamic content with the help of react.

23
00:01:58,510 --> 00:02:03,820
These are all the important takeaways and again there is more we will learn and more you can learn about

24
00:02:03,820 --> 00:02:08,980
react in general but these are the concepts which definitely should be clear by now.
