1
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,520
On the front end we also can work with environment variables.

2
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:12,180
There of course we're not using Node 1 but you can simply add a new file thought EMV and this file will

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,200
automatically be used by the configured build and development process we're using here.

4
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:22,610
This is a create react app project in the end and the react scripts package which is used under the

5
00:00:22,620 --> 00:00:30,060
hood picks up such a dot EMV file automatically and we can use the dot in we file to also store data

6
00:00:30,090 --> 00:00:35,310
we need here on the front end so which environment variables could we use here on the front end.

7
00:00:35,460 --> 00:00:40,860
We could use one environment variable for this Google API key we're using in the index HD email file

8
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:47,160
in the public folder and I think we got one ever environment variable that would make sense and that

9
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:55,410
is d u r l we're sending our back and requests to hear it's local host five thousand and not only are

10
00:00:55,410 --> 00:01:01,830
we duplicating this code everywhere where we are sending a request this of course will not be the correct

11
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,950
you are L once our application is deployed because once the node application is on a real server it

12
00:01:07,950 --> 00:01:14,100
will have a real IP or a real domain attached to it and therefore this will then simply no longer be

13
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:15,220
correct.

14
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:17,770
So there are two environment variables I want to add.

15
00:01:17,890 --> 00:01:19,380
Now here's one important thing.

16
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:27,420
Your environment variables here have to start with react app all caps react app underscore actually

17
00:01:27,430 --> 00:01:31,710
all caps for no chance for the back end this was not required.

18
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:34,100
You could use any names here for the front end.

19
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:35,610
This is required.

20
00:01:35,610 --> 00:01:41,490
Also keep in mind that of course the front end code as you will see later in this module will be built

21
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,840
locally on our machine and then we just upload the built files.

22
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:51,080
So the prepared H team Al javascript and see us as files to a server.

23
00:01:51,090 --> 00:01:56,160
This also means that you must not have any confidential data in your code.

24
00:01:56,250 --> 00:01:59,970
So also here in your environment variables would ever use store here.

25
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,900
When you use it in your react code later everyone can read and see it in the deployed application because

26
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:13,830
it's not running on a server it's running in the user's browser so therefore never store any confidential

27
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,600
data in your react app no matter if you're using environment variables or not.

28
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:25,740
So with that however here we could store our ReACT app Google API key and that is simply set a value

29
00:02:25,740 --> 00:02:31,320
here in this file by adding a equals sign and then right there after without any whitespace as the value

30
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:32,340
you want to store.

31
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:35,820
So it looks a bit different than in the note man Jason File.

32
00:02:35,820 --> 00:02:41,760
Here we will had a Jason format here it's just a simple key value pair file and a new line.

33
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:47,040
I will add another environment variable and this will be my back end.

34
00:02:47,070 --> 00:02:49,350
You are L and now here.

35
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,490
During development that will be locally hosted 5000 slash API.

36
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:04,200
Let's say later we can swap this for a different value in production so with this we prepared to 2 environment

37
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:04,790
variables.

38
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:06,470
How do we inject them.

39
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:08,190
We get two different sin taxes.

40
00:03:08,190 --> 00:03:13,090
I want to inject my Google API key in the public index each html file.

41
00:03:13,320 --> 00:03:19,920
There if you want to inject an environment variable like this key here you do so by adding percentage

42
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:26,460
signs at the beginning and end and in between you reference your environment verbal name so react app

43
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,700
Google API key.

44
00:03:28,740 --> 00:03:35,370
In my case here or whatever value you defined here in this thought and file this should go in here and

45
00:03:35,370 --> 00:03:38,530
it has to be between two percentage signs.

46
00:03:38,610 --> 00:03:43,560
So that's how we add an environment variable in the index age to metal file in our javascript code.

47
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:45,480
We use them in a different way.

48
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:51,450
We use them just as we would use them in notorious for example in New Place J J.S. here.

49
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:58,560
I want to replace this part now with my environment variable with this react app back and you are L

50
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:06,210
environment variable and to do so we use process thought and again so the same syntax you know from

51
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:07,510
notorious.

52
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:08,570
And then simply.

53
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:12,810
Well at your part after you are L which is dynamic.

54
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,980
So this is how we can refer to the back and you are L here.

55
00:04:16,070 --> 00:04:23,580
With that I will quickly search for local host five thousand in my project here to replace all occurrences

56
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:26,240
for example in place item here.

57
00:04:26,550 --> 00:04:30,020
I will get rid of this part always although delete slash API.

58
00:04:30,030 --> 00:04:33,770
Because in my case at least I included that in the environment variable.

59
00:04:34,260 --> 00:04:38,900
So that's my correct you are L now here for the image it's the same.

60
00:04:38,930 --> 00:04:42,380
They are however and that's a little mistake on my side.

61
00:04:42,480 --> 00:04:52,990
I don't need slash API so I will add a new you are L here react app acid you are L because we could

62
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:57,870
theoretically also upload our images to a wholly different page so think it makes sense to store it

63
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:02,620
is in a new environment variable and now I will use reactive acids you are L here

64
00:05:05,430 --> 00:05:13,930
so Paula assign react AB as if you are L and of course access does on processed ends and with that we

65
00:05:13,930 --> 00:05:20,290
make sure that we are able to access d you are L where our images are stored removed trailing slash

66
00:05:20,290 --> 00:05:26,290
here in the environment variable file though because I do have to slash here.

67
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:34,450
Now let's move on here and update place I do send a request so let's remove that part including API

68
00:05:35,260 --> 00:05:44,020
and instead injected here says DOT and three act app back and you are.

69
00:05:44,020 --> 00:05:47,680
L was the U R L I was using.

70
00:05:47,720 --> 00:05:55,570
Same here let's replace this part here with dynamic where with the environment variable part to be precise

71
00:05:56,730 --> 00:05:58,260
like this.

72
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,340
In user places it's the same.

73
00:06:03,340 --> 00:06:07,460
Let's replace that here with our API for Avatar image.

74
00:06:07,450 --> 00:06:09,970
It's again our back and asset you are L.

75
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,770
So yea I will use my upper environment variable process thought and react

76
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:30,380
and then the name was asset you are L so your asset you are l like this in off J as let's get rid of

77
00:06:30,530 --> 00:06:39,920
this here and instead again use process dot and react back and you are L and combine this with the string

78
00:06:42,010 --> 00:06:50,240
in of J is here it's the same get rid of this part combine it like that and end users J as the same

79
00:06:50,450 --> 00:06:53,490
get rid of this combine it like that.

80
00:06:53,630 --> 00:07:00,380
So with that I ensure that everywhere in this application we are able to conveniently control the back

81
00:07:00,380 --> 00:07:06,090
and you are L fruity dot env file here and the Google API key as well.

82
00:07:06,230 --> 00:07:11,360
Now of course we still have a couple of unanswered questions at this point how can we provide different

83
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,260
values for production here in reacts and notes case and what do we do with that Google API key.

84
00:07:18,260 --> 00:07:24,110
Well let's start with the Google API key before I then come back to that whole production values thing.
