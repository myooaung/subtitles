1
00:00:02,230 --> 00:00:04,700
And that's it for this module.

2
00:00:04,780 --> 00:00:06,610
We wrote a lot of code here.

3
00:00:06,610 --> 00:00:14,140
We built an entire little react application made up of a bunch of components including Google Maps and

4
00:00:14,140 --> 00:00:15,880
much much more.

5
00:00:15,880 --> 00:00:19,160
There's tons of stuff we can do with this application.

6
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:23,430
And this really shows what you can build with react only.

7
00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,560
Now of course we're not done though.

8
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:27,420
This is not a react only course.

9
00:00:27,430 --> 00:00:31,750
This is a course about react and Node express Mongo D.B..

10
00:00:31,810 --> 00:00:37,690
So in the next modules we'll dive into a well node Express and Mongo TB and we'll build a back and forth

11
00:00:37,690 --> 00:00:43,900
his application as well so that all the cool features we implemented here with components with hooks

12
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,550
with context with our own form validation and our custom hook ends on.

13
00:00:48,550 --> 00:00:54,790
So that all these cool features don't just work here and as standalone front end application but that

14
00:00:54,790 --> 00:01:01,720
we actually have a real merged application a full stack application where we connect the front end to

15
00:01:01,720 --> 00:01:02,890
the back end as well.

16
00:01:03,070 --> 00:01:06,190
So it this something we'll do as a next step in this course.
