00:00:02.190 --> 00:00:08.940
Let's start with the preparation steps we should go through before we actually move our code to some

2
00:00:08.940 --> 00:00:09.960
server.

3
00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:12.450
Now the first step is the obvious one.

4
00:00:12.450 --> 00:00:17.760
We develop our app and we test our code and we did this throughout this course.

5
00:00:17.760 --> 00:00:21.460
We continuously added features and we always tested this.

6
00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:28.020
And of course you want to really test different scenarios all the test with different users on different

7
00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:29.700
devices maybe.

8
00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.760
And also what was not the focus in this course.

9
00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:38.250
You of course have all the want to ensure that your scripts and your see as this code works across a

10
00:00:38.250 --> 00:00:44.430
broad variety of browsers but the exact steps there really depend on the kind of application you're

11
00:00:44.430 --> 00:00:45.570
building.

12
00:00:45.570 --> 00:00:50.430
So let's assume everything works fine there and we're happy with the result we got.

13
00:00:50.430 --> 00:00:57.130
Well then we want to move on to the next step before we actually move our code to the servers.

14
00:00:57.270 --> 00:01:05.370
We want to swap our A you are alt which point at local host or anything like that for real you or else

15
00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:10.590
which point at a back end so to the server where our app reads is hosted on.

16
00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:18.210
And we also want to make sure that any credentials or API keys we're using in our code both on the back

17
00:01:18.210 --> 00:01:25.050
and or the front end are prepared for deployment so that they are production ready that we may be locked

18
00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:29.540
down access to certain IP or whatever we want to do there.

19
00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:35.760
And we want to look into environment variables there and we will do so here in this course so that we

20
00:01:35.760 --> 00:01:42.450
can easily swap certain values for testing locally and for deployment so you will see how we could do

21
00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:45.030
that in this module.

22
00:01:45.030 --> 00:01:50.730
And once all of that is done we want to build our application most importantly our front end application

23
00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:57.660
which means we want to build it the code optimize it and bundle it to have as small of a code as possible

24
00:01:57.990 --> 00:02:00.750
and then deployed to a server.

25
00:02:00.870 --> 00:02:05.460
And once our application is deployed of course the work doesn't stop there.

26
00:02:05.460 --> 00:02:11.360
After we won a test this deployed application as well and checked that everything is working.

27
00:02:11.430 --> 00:02:17.940
And of course even once your app is up and running you want to monitor it and maybe adjusted back fix

28
00:02:18.070 --> 00:02:19.500
and so on.

29
00:02:19.500 --> 00:02:25.560
So let's now go through these steps and ensure that by the end of this module we have our application

30
00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:27.210
running on real servers.
