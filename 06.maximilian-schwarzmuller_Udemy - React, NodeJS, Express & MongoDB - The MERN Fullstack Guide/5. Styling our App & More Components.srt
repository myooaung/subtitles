1
00:00:02,330 --> 00:00:06,590
We have this ugly looking application and now it's time to change that.

2
00:00:06,620 --> 00:00:09,090
Attached you find to see us as follows.

3
00:00:09,140 --> 00:00:15,950
Users lists CSA s and user items C as s and you can replace yours with those files or simply copy the

4
00:00:15,950 --> 00:00:19,880
content you find in those files into your respective files.

5
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:21,350
That's what I'll do here.

6
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:23,020
Just paste it all in.

7
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,800
Now safeties it reloads and doesn't look that much better.

8
00:00:27,800 --> 00:00:35,980
We still have this super huge image here and just our text is a little bit differently formatted now.

9
00:00:36,100 --> 00:00:43,820
Now to change that I prepared a separate component which we will add two shared components and they

10
00:00:43,820 --> 00:00:50,390
are all create new sub folder UI elements to have some core UI elements we need.

11
00:00:50,390 --> 00:00:56,810
And there you can paste in a component you also find attached in the Avatar CIP file you find a Avatar

12
00:00:56,810 --> 00:01:01,940
J.S. and Avatar as as file paste both into UI elements.

13
00:01:01,970 --> 00:01:03,070
So did you have avatar.

14
00:01:03,080 --> 00:01:05,750
J Is there an avatar of CSX.

15
00:01:05,750 --> 00:01:11,140
We're not writing this from scratch because I don't want to bore you with writing more and more components.

16
00:01:11,150 --> 00:01:17,030
This is a component which has a div which wraps the image and which has some styling to properly styled

17
00:01:17,030 --> 00:01:22,660
at Image and we can use this avatar component in our user item component down.

18
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:34,470
So let's go back to user item and in their import Avatar from going up to levels shared components UI

19
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:35,170
elements.

20
00:01:35,250 --> 00:01:36,540
Avatar.

21
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:45,480
And then here replaced his image tag not the surrounding div but the image tag with Avatar and to Avatar.

22
00:01:45,480 --> 00:01:50,850
You need to pass a image prop because if you inspect that component I do expect the image and the old

23
00:01:50,850 --> 00:02:01,700
prop also with Prop by the way so I do pass in an image here and set this to props image and the all

24
00:02:01,710 --> 00:02:04,400
prop which has set to props name.

25
00:02:04,410 --> 00:02:08,870
Now I'll not pass in a value for the width and Aldon or for a class I'm in style.

26
00:02:08,910 --> 00:02:15,510
This component Justice build such that it supports these special props and later we might need that

27
00:02:15,870 --> 00:02:17,160
but you don't have to use that.

28
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,340
There are some default stylings and if those are right for you there is no need to change this.

29
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:31,140
So we only pass the old and the image prop and if we now save this this definitely looks better now

30
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,710
it's still not perfect though we can still improve that it will look better once we wrap our user a

31
00:02:37,710 --> 00:02:43,590
component also into a link because I have some styles set up for anchor tax and a one to have a link

32
00:02:43,620 --> 00:02:48,480
because when we clicked the user it already has a hover state right when they clicked the user.

33
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,300
I want to be taken to all the places this user created.

34
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:59,670
Now we won't render a link with a regular boring anchor tag though because instead we again want to

35
00:02:59,670 --> 00:03:06,060
leverage react router Dom and make sure that we don't have a real link which would try to load a brand

36
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:12,140
new page and therefore would reload our existing page but that instead do react routing package react

37
00:03:12,140 --> 00:03:20,310
router Dom can step in before a navigation happens before a page reload happens and block that default

38
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,310
action from happening and instead have a look at our configured routes here and load the appropriate

39
00:03:26,310 --> 00:03:30,900
react component we want to give react broader damage chance of doing that.

40
00:03:30,960 --> 00:03:39,270
So here in user item I will import something from react router Dom and that something is the link component

41
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:40,740
under the hood.

42
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:48,750
This wraps and renders an anchor attack but it also adds this extra block the navigation logic we use

43
00:03:48,750 --> 00:03:55,350
that instead of the list item inside of the div here but outside of that div which holds the image we

44
00:03:55,350 --> 00:04:01,550
can add a link opening tag and then a closing tag after this inner death.

45
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,000
And now all the links you need to specify to prop which defines where to you want to go and there's

46
00:04:08,010 --> 00:04:10,260
no actually will be a dynamic path.

47
00:04:10,320 --> 00:04:16,940
It's not always the same you are because it is a you or L that should reflect the I.D. of the user because

48
00:04:16,950 --> 00:04:20,420
we want to load all the places for a given user later.

49
00:04:20,460 --> 00:04:27,840
So the idea is that later we have something like user I.D. places for example where user I.D. of course

50
00:04:27,930 --> 00:04:32,480
is dynamic and not always the same because we will have multiple users.

51
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:38,630
So to here is built with help of a dynamic expression and hence we need curly braces.

52
00:04:38,700 --> 00:04:43,980
And then here I will use back takes to create a template literal which means a string where we can easily

53
00:04:43,980 --> 00:04:52,600
inject values and I want to go to slash and then inject a value and that value will be props ideas.

54
00:04:52,610 --> 00:05:00,240
So it will be the user I.D. slash places so that we always have a different link for every user.

55
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:07,670
If we now say if this does looks way better and now we can hover over it is and click it and nothing

56
00:05:07,670 --> 00:05:08,360
happens.

57
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:14,200
But if you watch the bottom of your browser you see that it will go to slash user I.D. slash places.

58
00:05:14,300 --> 00:05:16,220
We just haven't added such a page yet.

59
00:05:16,220 --> 00:05:18,440
Which is why at the moment nothing happens.

60
00:05:18,440 --> 00:05:22,420
But generally this works and that is of course amazing.

61
00:05:22,670 --> 00:05:25,790
Now I'm still not entirely happy with the way this looks.

62
00:05:25,790 --> 00:05:32,000
I also want to add another utility component which you also find attached to this video to this lecture

63
00:05:32,480 --> 00:05:40,550
and that's the card the card CIB file if you extracted holds a card J.S. and cards C Ss file copy both

64
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:44,640
into your shared components UI elements folder as well.

65
00:05:44,780 --> 00:05:50,510
This renders a simple diff with some nice styling attached with a little drop shadow and so on it gives

66
00:05:50,510 --> 00:05:51,750
us this card look.

67
00:05:51,770 --> 00:05:57,770
You might know from our web pages and now we can use doesn't use our item as well there.

68
00:05:57,830 --> 00:06:10,470
We can now also import the card import card from shared components UI elements card and wrap our link

69
00:06:11,040 --> 00:06:12,030
with it.

70
00:06:12,030 --> 00:06:19,340
So instead of that inner div but outside of the link add card and then close card after Dilly.

71
00:06:19,400 --> 00:06:24,810
And with that it looks a bit worse actually because now is one thing we need to do.

72
00:06:24,860 --> 00:06:28,320
We now need to get rid of this div here.

73
00:06:28,370 --> 00:06:33,440
Copy the class name first don't get rid of the off the opening and closing tacked or after and add the

74
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:39,920
closet him to card because card is a component that is able to accept the class name prop and merged

75
00:06:39,920 --> 00:06:41,840
with its own classes.

76
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:48,470
And with that if we safeties we now have a nice look rounded corners does nice Cardi look with a slight

77
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:49,450
drop shadow.

78
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:52,130
And I think this now looks really nice.

79
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,440
Now of course still it's a relatively empty page and we will add more but we are getting there and at

80
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,940
least now we have our list of users with only one user at the moment.

81
00:07:01,940 --> 00:07:05,480
But we could render more and we can click that user.

82
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:07,130
So that is pretty nice.

83
00:07:07,130 --> 00:07:08,940
That is a nice first step.

84
00:07:08,990 --> 00:07:14,090
Now let's continue our work and let's add more and more components and then also at some point more

85
00:07:14,090 --> 00:07:15,040
and more logic.
