00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.170
We get the general authentication logic implemented.

2
00:00:05.170 --> 00:00:07.920
Now there's one tiny optional change.

3
00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:09.200
I want to make.

4
00:00:09.250 --> 00:00:16.210
We got a lot of off related logic here in AB J.S. and you can't keep it there but I personally think

5
00:00:16.420 --> 00:00:24.280
a custom hook which would manage all this user auth related data and logic would be quite neat.

6
00:00:24.310 --> 00:00:31.570
We could take all that state here to log in and to log out function and these two use affect calls and

7
00:00:31.570 --> 00:00:33.860
we could cut it all from here.

8
00:00:34.060 --> 00:00:39.250
If we have a properly implemented hook so we'll add my own hook here.

9
00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:49.450
Do you off hook and in their export of function use off or however you want to name it and then deer

10
00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:51.000
paste in everything.

11
00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:58.620
I just cut from app J.S. now in here I of course need to import some things from react.

12
00:00:58.630 --> 00:01:01.930
I need to import use state I need to import.

13
00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:12.580
Use callback and use effect and I also here of course want to have my logout timer so I'll cut this

14
00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.090
variable here as well and added as a variable outside of my hook.

15
00:01:17.170 --> 00:01:24.980
Here now this hook should return something it should return access to my log in and log out functions

16
00:01:25.220 --> 00:01:30.860
as well as information about the state so I will return token here.

17
00:01:30.860 --> 00:01:33.700
I will return log in and I will return.

18
00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:45.440
Log out in this object and return overall from my hook and now in AB J.S. we can import use off from

19
00:01:47.890 --> 00:01:53.660
shared hooks off hook and then just call it like this here.

20
00:01:53.690 --> 00:02:04.100
Use of and we get back an object which we can d structure which has the token which has to log in and

21
00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:05.260
to log out.

22
00:02:05.270 --> 00:02:08.290
Function here at the bottom.

23
00:02:08.290 --> 00:02:12.790
I always want the user I.D. So in the off hook we should return this as well.

24
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:14.620
It is a state off his hook.

25
00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:23.400
So of course we can simply return user I.D. this state here I simply return this here as well and they

26
00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:30.780
offer an app to us we can extract it we can extract user I.D. from the object use of returns and with

27
00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:32.880
that our aptly as follows should work.

28
00:02:32.880 --> 00:02:41.230
Ask before everything should work ask before we can now just clean up some unused imports here but we

29
00:02:41.230 --> 00:02:43.880
shouldn't have any changes in the app functionality.

30
00:02:43.900 --> 00:02:48.100
So if I log in here this should still work if I reload.

31
00:02:48.100 --> 00:02:50.430
This works for manually log out.

32
00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:54.320
I stay locked out if I log in again thereafter.

33
00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:57.240
This should all the work again.

34
00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:57.660
Yeah.

35
00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:02.260
Looking good if I try to added to my place here.

36
00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:12.160
Well I have no places so if I add a place here Marine plus you know the place Marine plus one and pic

37
00:03:12.250 --> 00:03:20.770
my image and click Add place does all the works I can retrieve it here I can add it so clearly my token

38
00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:21.980
is managed correctly.

39
00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:29.620
Otherwise the back end would complain I can reload and this day offer is all looking pretty pretty neat.

40
00:03:29.710 --> 00:03:34.030
So as Dad we added off indication and I think with the off hook.

41
00:03:34.030 --> 00:03:40.480
We also were able to outsource all the core of logic into a separate file and therefore keep our app

42
00:03:40.480 --> 00:03:43.500
J.S. file really really leading.
