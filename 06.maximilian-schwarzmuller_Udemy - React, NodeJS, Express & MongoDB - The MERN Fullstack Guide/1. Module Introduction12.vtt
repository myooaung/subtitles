00:00:02.110 --> 00:00:09.760
In this module we'll get started with the back end of our application will build our note J.S. express

2
00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:18.040
REST API and write all the code we need to write to handle incoming requests for different routes and

3
00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:23.250
much more specifically in this module we will set up this note and express app.

4
00:00:23.260 --> 00:00:27.670
We learned how that works in general in the refresher module.

5
00:00:27.670 --> 00:00:34.930
Now we'll do it in a real project will add the roots which we need for our project to handle different

6
00:00:34.930 --> 00:00:43.930
requests with different H P methods targeting different paths will add controllers and some dummy logic

7
00:00:43.960 --> 00:00:44.660
for now.

8
00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.950
Later we'll also add database ends on but in this module we'll just get started with some dummy logic

9
00:00:50.950 --> 00:00:58.450
with some in memory storage ends on and will add controllers because we will kind of use the MVC to

10
00:00:58.450 --> 00:01:04.120
model view controller pattern without the view because it's a REST API but we will work with models

11
00:01:04.120 --> 00:01:12.400
and controllers and we'll also make sure that any data we receive from which ever a client that is connected

12
00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:20.290
is also valid data so we'll add some server side input validation to make sure that the data which is

13
00:01:20.290 --> 00:01:28.840
attached to the incoming requests meets our requirements for example that the title of a new place is

14
00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.650
not an empty text string or something like this.

15
00:01:32.650 --> 00:01:39.160
This is what we'll do in this module and we will day off for now implement these API end points which

16
00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:40.940
we planned earlier.

17
00:01:41.170 --> 00:01:48.760
Now to be precise will not add everything we need to add for the user routes for a sign up and log in

18
00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:55.030
will not implement this at the moment will add authentication in a separate module later in the course

19
00:01:55.390 --> 00:02:01.150
but we will set up the general routes for data and write some dummy code in there and four places will

20
00:02:01.210 --> 00:02:07.780
also not yet add a database that will happen at a later point of time but we will set up all the routes

21
00:02:07.870 --> 00:02:11.550
and store some places in memory for the moment.

22
00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:12.960
This is what we'll do now.

23
00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.790
And with that I'd say let's get started.
