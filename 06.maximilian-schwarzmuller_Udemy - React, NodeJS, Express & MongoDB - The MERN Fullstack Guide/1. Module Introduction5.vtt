00:00:02.510 --> 00:00:10.010
We built a complete moron application with all four technologies and Wolf obviously now it's time to

2
00:00:10.010 --> 00:00:13.700
not just tested locally but instead to also deploy it.

3
00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:20.660
So to move the application onto our real server where our users can reach it as well because at the

4
00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:27.470
moment of course it only runs locally on local host which means only we can see and use this application.

5
00:00:27.590 --> 00:00:34.760
Therefore in this module we will have a look at the steps we should go through to prepare our application

6
00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.860
for deployment and some things you should keep in mind and you should have a look at when you want to

7
00:00:39.860 --> 00:00:47.450
deploy your application and then I will show you two different ways of deploying more naps you could

8
00:00:47.450 --> 00:00:47.960
use.

9
00:00:47.990 --> 00:00:52.460
So two different ways of getting your marine app onto real servers.

10
00:00:52.460 --> 00:00:53.210
So let's dive in.
