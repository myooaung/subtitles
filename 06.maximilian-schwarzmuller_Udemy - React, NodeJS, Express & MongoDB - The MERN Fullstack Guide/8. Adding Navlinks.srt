1
00:00:02,380 --> 00:00:05,940
Let's work on the navigation links snow pretend.

2
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:10,090
Let's go to NAV links and import react from react.

3
00:00:10,090 --> 00:00:17,120
Because here I want to have a list of navigation links of links in my main header or also in the sidebar

4
00:00:17,170 --> 00:00:20,200
depending on where were you rendered at so there.

5
00:00:20,200 --> 00:00:23,920
I'll have my nav links component which could receive some props.

6
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:28,990
We'll see if we need that and then export nav links as a default.

7
00:00:28,990 --> 00:00:35,130
I also of course want to import dot slash nav links dot CSA as for some styling.

8
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:43,190
Now instead of NAV links I will definitely also return some J as X code that includes some links so

9
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:46,580
we'll import something from react ruder dom.

10
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:50,470
But that something is not link but its NAV link.

11
00:00:50,510 --> 00:00:58,730
A special link in the end which also can analyze the RL and allows us to for example color the link

12
00:00:58,730 --> 00:01:03,530
differently if we are on the page the link leads to to show the user dead.

13
00:01:03,530 --> 00:01:09,230
This is the currently active link for example and then here I return to unordered list where I'll add

14
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:15,080
a class name of NAF dash links to it and you should do the same to make sure that the styling I will

15
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:16,070
provide to you.

16
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:24,020
Works and then we have a list item in there without a c as as class and they are a nav link which leads

17
00:01:24,020 --> 00:01:28,640
to slash nothing and says all users.

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:40,220
For example and that will now copy that to provide another link here to lets say my places to later

19
00:01:40,220 --> 00:01:42,530
view all the places we created.

20
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:44,750
So our places.

21
00:01:44,750 --> 00:01:51,770
Let's add another link where we say new place so that we can also add a new place later or also add

22
00:01:51,770 --> 00:01:52,220
place.

23
00:01:52,220 --> 00:01:55,470
Therefore and another link

24
00:01:58,310 --> 00:02:05,990
authenticate which will not be that important right now because we won't add full fledged authentication

25
00:02:05,990 --> 00:02:06,820
at this point.

26
00:02:06,950 --> 00:02:09,310
But it's still good to already have that link.

27
00:02:09,320 --> 00:02:13,850
Now be aware that later not all links will be rendered all the time.

28
00:02:13,850 --> 00:02:18,240
For example my places will only be rendered if we are locked in.

29
00:02:18,290 --> 00:02:23,900
Otherwise there is no way we can view our own places at place will only be rendered if we are logged

30
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:28,850
in authenticate on the other hand will only be rendered if we are not locked in.

31
00:02:28,850 --> 00:02:30,860
So at the moment they are all rendered.

32
00:02:30,860 --> 00:02:32,920
This will not be the case later.

33
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:35,020
That's really important to understand.

34
00:02:35,090 --> 00:02:39,460
Also one other thing too the first NAF link which leads to slash.

35
00:02:39,470 --> 00:02:42,320
Nothing at exact as a prop.

36
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:47,480
This tells the NAF link that it should only mark does link as active and apply to styling.

37
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:53,960
I will give you in Napoli C as s later when we are exactly on slash nothing and not on any route that

38
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,240
starts with Slash.

39
00:02:55,250 --> 00:03:00,650
Because that would be every route and then this would always be marked as D active link.

40
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:03,990
Also we need to adjust the other 2 props here of course.

41
00:03:04,130 --> 00:03:08,390
For my places I want to go to slash you one slash places.

42
00:03:08,390 --> 00:03:10,160
This is a dummy place holder.

43
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:16,580
Later we will populate that with the real user I.D. of the authenticated user but since we have no authenticated

44
00:03:16,580 --> 00:03:22,770
users at the moment there's nothing we can do regarding that here on ad place.

45
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:25,880
I want to go to slash places slash new.

46
00:03:25,930 --> 00:03:31,990
That's the link we were missing before which we had to manually enter and here let's say for authenticate.

47
00:03:31,990 --> 00:03:33,830
I want to go to slash off.

48
00:03:33,960 --> 00:03:38,580
No that's up to you we haven't added that around yet but we will add it later.

49
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:43,510
So now we have all these NAF links we can now use that in the main navigation component.

50
00:03:43,510 --> 00:03:52,420
So in there we can simply import nav links from dot dot slash Nath links and then render this year instead

51
00:03:52,450 --> 00:04:00,370
of the free dots nav links like this all the important attached to now find a nav links CSA as file

52
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:06,760
and you should replace yours or the continent side of it with my nav link see us as content if you do

53
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:12,160
that and you'll save all files you should see nav links here and you see the active page highlighted

54
00:04:12,160 --> 00:04:13,000
like this.

55
00:04:13,060 --> 00:04:17,410
Of course you can always by the way adjust styles indices as follows If you want to have a different

56
00:04:17,410 --> 00:04:19,170
styling does it just a.

57
00:04:19,180 --> 00:04:24,810
I will go with so all users is currently active if I click on Add place to see does this now active.

58
00:04:24,850 --> 00:04:30,590
So this works we can switch here and of course some routes are not yet supported for example my places

59
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:35,910
and authenticate we always are redirected there because I haven't registered routes for them yet but

60
00:04:35,920 --> 00:04:41,170
at place and all users were X and now we can switch with help of these buttons.

61
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:46,750
Now that's great if we highlight this in Mobile you here in the Chrome dev tools by clicking on this

62
00:04:46,750 --> 00:04:51,650
icon though we have the hamburger icon but clicking on it doesn't really do much.

63
00:04:51,650 --> 00:04:53,150
We open those sidebar.

64
00:04:53,180 --> 00:04:59,840
Instead I have the NAV links all clammed in here which doesn't look super great so we should fix that

65
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,260
and we should make sure that on mobile view does.

66
00:05:02,290 --> 00:05:03,450
Also looks good.
