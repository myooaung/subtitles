00:00:02.210 --> 00:00:10.370
So what our ReACT portals portals and react is new and a concept that allows us to project or render

2
00:00:10.550 --> 00:00:15.060
a react component in a different place than it normally would be rendered.

3
00:00:15.260 --> 00:00:21.530
Normally the sides draw would be rendered as part of our main navigation and therefore wherever dismay

4
00:00:21.530 --> 00:00:23.500
navigation is rendered.

5
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:30.350
Now with a portal we can mark a new place in our H.M. file so in public indignation L where we want

6
00:00:30.350 --> 00:00:32.350
to render our portal content.

7
00:00:32.390 --> 00:00:42.200
In this case I will add a new div in front of my root div here and I will named as draw hook.

8
00:00:42.220 --> 00:00:43.510
The name is totally up to you.

9
00:00:43.540 --> 00:00:47.050
So this has an idea of draw hook and it's outside of the root div.

10
00:00:47.260 --> 00:00:49.240
Its next to it in front of it.

11
00:00:50.100 --> 00:00:53.480
This is where I want to render my side drawing.

12
00:00:53.850 --> 00:00:57.220
So now back to decide draw.

13
00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:03.260
We have to tell react that it should render discontent here for that I'll first of all store my j is

14
00:01:03.260 --> 00:01:05.090
X content in a new constant.

15
00:01:05.090 --> 00:01:06.230
You can do that.

16
00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:12.230
You can do with J as x whatever you can do with a regular javascript expression so you can also store

17
00:01:12.230 --> 00:01:15.410
it in variables or constants not just return it.

18
00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:18.570
And what I will return is something different than before.

19
00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:24.090
We need to import react Dom from react dash Dom.

20
00:01:24.090 --> 00:01:30.750
This is the other part of the react library which thus far we only used to render the react application

21
00:01:30.750 --> 00:01:31.320
itself.

22
00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:36.410
Here in index J as well it turns out react Dom has more than just a render method.

23
00:01:36.510 --> 00:01:46.010
We can also use react Dom dot create portal and now we tell react which content to render where and

24
00:01:46.230 --> 00:01:47.630
there a point at content.

25
00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:50.550
So what's stored in this content constant.

26
00:01:50.550 --> 00:01:55.620
And then we need to select a place in the DOM where just content should be rendered when this component

27
00:01:56.070 --> 00:02:03.980
is mounted when this component is used and here I want to get an element by ideas in my HMO page and

28
00:02:03.980 --> 00:02:10.430
there I used the idea just assigned there which is the draw hook and we save that we see the same result

29
00:02:10.430 --> 00:02:16.250
as before but semantically does is now rendered differently which I like a bit more it's inside of the

30
00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.580
draw hook now.

31
00:02:17.570 --> 00:02:22.940
Now isn't the end of the world if you don't do it like this it does not even bad but I find it interesting

32
00:02:22.940 --> 00:02:26.280
to also dive into portals here and show you this alternative.

33
00:02:26.330 --> 00:02:32.210
It's especially intriguing if side draw would be included in some deeply nested component and you would

34
00:02:32.270 --> 00:02:37.350
otherwise render it somewhere deeply inside your element tree in the DOM.

35
00:02:37.370 --> 00:02:42.410
Well then a portal might be especially nice because it allows you to render the content of a component

36
00:02:42.860 --> 00:02:48.650
in a different place then the component itself the component is part of the component tree so to say

37
00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.800
and the content is rendered somewhere else that's a portal that doesn't solve our problem that the draw

38
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:57.260
is always visible and not animated though.

39
00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:58.400
So let's work on that.
