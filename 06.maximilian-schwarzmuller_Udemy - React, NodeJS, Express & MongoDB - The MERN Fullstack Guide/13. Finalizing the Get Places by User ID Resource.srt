1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,590
Now actually before we move onto these user rods there's one tiny bug I want to fix or little oversight

2
00:00:08,590 --> 00:00:12,490
from my site in places controller I have get placed by user I.D..

3
00:00:12,950 --> 00:00:18,430
Now obviously here we can only get one place because in dummy places I added only one place.

4
00:00:18,430 --> 00:00:24,970
If we had more than one place and that place had a different creator I.D. or it had the same creator

5
00:00:24,970 --> 00:00:26,680
I.D. It wouldn't matter.

6
00:00:26,680 --> 00:00:31,300
I would always just get the first place where the creator I.D. matches.

7
00:00:31,300 --> 00:00:32,400
Of course that's wrong.

8
00:00:32,440 --> 00:00:38,800
This year should be called Get play says by user I.D. and instead of a single place we should be retrieving

9
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:42,700
multiple places here because every user can have multiple places.

10
00:00:42,700 --> 00:00:49,330
There can be more places here that shared the same creator I.D. It's not a unique one to one mapping.

11
00:00:49,390 --> 00:00:52,860
We can have multiple places with the same creator I.D..

12
00:00:53,110 --> 00:00:59,410
So therefore here we want to have get places by user I.D. and here we don't want to find which gives

13
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:06,040
us the first place that matches the criteria we want to use filter instead because filter will return

14
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:10,150
a new array full of elements that fulfill this criteria.

15
00:01:10,300 --> 00:01:11,560
So full of elements.

16
00:01:11,620 --> 00:01:18,400
Where did creator I.D. equal to the extracted user I.D. therefore let's name this here places and check

17
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:27,460
if we don't have places or more realistic if places length is equal to zero maybe if that's the case

18
00:01:27,490 --> 00:01:34,710
we didn't find places for that creator I.D. And then I want to return cannot find places for the provided

19
00:01:34,710 --> 00:01:39,550
user I.D. and here of course I return places and not a single place.

20
00:01:39,570 --> 00:01:42,120
Now we need to adjust it down there on the exports as well.

21
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:48,730
This should be get place sets by user I.D. in on both sides and in the in the places.

22
00:01:48,730 --> 00:01:49,890
ROBERTS Of course here.

23
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:57,800
I also want to point at get placed says by user I.D. with Dad if we save that and we go back to postman

24
00:01:57,830 --> 00:02:06,860
and send the request to local host 5000 slash API slash places slash user slash you 1 which is that

25
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:09,770
one dummy user I.D. I have here.

26
00:02:09,770 --> 00:02:10,620
Right.

27
00:02:10,670 --> 00:02:16,700
We should get back and erase if I sent this here it's an array of places.

28
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,330
Now of course with only one place because we have only one matching place but that's battered and nothing.

29
00:02:22,430 --> 00:02:29,030
If I sent this for you two for example we get back could not find places for the provided user I.D.

30
00:02:29,060 --> 00:02:33,260
because indeed we have no places 40 provide the user I.D. then.

31
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,590
So that is now better than before.

32
00:02:35,590 --> 00:02:42,020
This is the actual functionality I want to have in get places by user I.D. So let's make sure to fix

33
00:02:42,020 --> 00:02:42,320
that.
