1
00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:09,290
So back in our application again I got the front end open here in one window and the back and in no

2
00:00:09,290 --> 00:00:11,960
visuals you code the no next to it.

3
00:00:11,990 --> 00:00:16,760
Now it's all about accepting files both on the front and as well as the back end.

4
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:19,380
And it's up to you where you want to start.

5
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:24,740
I would say let's start at the front end so that we have a file right away which you then can send to

6
00:00:24,740 --> 00:00:25,690
the back end.

7
00:00:25,700 --> 00:00:30,230
So do we then as a next step can work on accepting that file on the back end.

8
00:00:30,590 --> 00:00:37,370
Now on the front that I got to places where I want to accept files one is the off page where new users

9
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:40,280
can authenticate where they can sign up.

10
00:00:40,490 --> 00:00:47,090
When you do is sign up I also want to offer a possibility for the user to provide an image or not just

11
00:00:47,090 --> 00:00:47,960
a possibility.

12
00:00:48,020 --> 00:00:49,990
You have to provide an image.

13
00:00:50,030 --> 00:00:53,590
So that's one place you should provide an image here.

14
00:00:53,600 --> 00:01:02,240
The other place where I also want to accept the file is in the places area in the new place component

15
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:07,730
when you add a new place besides adding title description address and so on.

16
00:01:07,730 --> 00:01:14,390
I also want to ensure that you have to provide an image for that place because we are using images for

17
00:01:14,390 --> 00:01:18,920
places and for users and I have these really nice dummy images here.

18
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:21,590
Well it would be nice to replace them.

19
00:01:21,650 --> 00:01:28,340
So in order to do that I will build an image picker and I will build a brand new component for that

20
00:01:28,490 --> 00:01:33,830
which we can reuse both on the new plays as well as the off page.

21
00:01:33,830 --> 00:01:38,140
So in form elements and shared components of form elements.

22
00:01:38,480 --> 00:01:45,170
I will add an image upload dot J as file and of course you can named as however you want attached you

23
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:46,480
all to find that image upload.

24
00:01:46,480 --> 00:01:51,730
Don't see us as file which you can just copy into this shared components form elements folder so that

25
00:01:51,740 --> 00:01:57,230
in the image upload js file or in the image upload component we're about to build you have the right

26
00:01:57,230 --> 00:02:02,900
stylings later of course you can always tweak them to your personal preferences we'll built the image

27
00:02:02,990 --> 00:02:05,830
upload component together from scratch no.

28
00:02:05,960 --> 00:02:09,760
And in there of course I will import react from react.

29
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:17,200
What we always did all setup my image upload component like this whips like this.

30
00:02:17,240 --> 00:02:22,320
Accepting props from outside and then in their will later returns I'm J X..

31
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:28,450
And of course we have to export the component here so that we can use it in our files as well.

32
00:02:28,490 --> 00:02:37,030
Now also don't forget to import image upload dot c as as to ensure that the styling gets applied now

33
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:38,890
in the image upload component.

34
00:02:38,890 --> 00:02:41,380
I want the returns I'm j as X code of course.

35
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:45,070
So let's write that markup for the image uploader together.

36
00:02:45,070 --> 00:02:47,940
Now as mentioned of course there are different ways of building this.

37
00:02:47,960 --> 00:02:55,850
Here's just my way I will add a wrapping device which has a class name of form dash control.

38
00:02:55,900 --> 00:03:03,220
This class name form control is provided an input CSX and whilst you might think that we're only importing

39
00:03:03,220 --> 00:03:10,450
this here in input J.S. don't forget that all these classes generally are available globally in the

40
00:03:10,450 --> 00:03:11,080
application.

41
00:03:11,090 --> 00:03:13,210
They're not scoped to a component.

42
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,130
We're not using C as some modules or anything like that here.

43
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:21,820
Hence we can use the form control class also in the image upload component.

44
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:28,900
Now in there I want to add a input and that input will be of type file which is a default input type

45
00:03:28,990 --> 00:03:31,360
supported by the browser.

46
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:40,760
This input will also receive an I.D. of let's say props I.D. and also a little inline style here.

47
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:44,990
Just a quick and dirty solution where I said display two non.

48
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:51,020
This is how you set inline styles and react to set an object to that style prop and then you have your

49
00:03:51,030 --> 00:03:59,290
CSX properties on the left as keys and then the values here on the right as values well and I use display

50
00:03:59,290 --> 00:04:05,710
not here because I actually want to hide this input with this play not it's still part of the Dom but

51
00:04:05,710 --> 00:04:11,500
it's not visible because I will expose a button to the user which the user can click to bring up that

52
00:04:11,500 --> 00:04:12,420
file picker.

53
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:17,000
I don't want to show this file picture itself because it's relatively ugly.

54
00:04:17,740 --> 00:04:27,130
So I will hide it here set the type to file and set except here to dot Jay Peck comma dot PNC comma

55
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:29,080
dot Che pack with an E..

56
00:04:29,410 --> 00:04:37,450
So these are the file extensions which a user is able to select then later.

57
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:40,620
Now of course as I said this is hidden so to show it.

58
00:04:40,620 --> 00:04:49,530
I also want to render a button and for that I will import the button component from dot slash button

59
00:04:49,800 --> 00:04:58,750
like this below this input here but inside of that surrounding div all day for add a new nested div

60
00:04:59,170 --> 00:05:07,750
this div receives a class name of image upload and actually I want to be a bit more flexible there so

61
00:05:07,750 --> 00:05:15,340
I will wrap this and put this into a template literal with back takes because I also want to check if

62
00:05:15,340 --> 00:05:20,800
we do have a center prop being set equal to true or being set at all.

63
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
And if it is I also want to add a center class here.

64
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:30,760
This allows us to later control how the image preview which will add anti picker button will be positioned

65
00:05:30,760 --> 00:05:32,410
if they're centered or not.

66
00:05:33,200 --> 00:05:39,600
So inside of this new div I'll add yet another div here and that div receives a class name off.

67
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:45,230
Image dash upload underscore underscore preview because I want to show a preview ofthe picked image

68
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:48,240
in there.

69
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:51,100
We need a image element therefore.

70
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:56,080
And here we'll need to set the source to something and do all to something.

71
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,060
I'll set the all to preview.

72
00:05:58,150 --> 00:06:04,230
The source is something we will come back to now outside of that div here.

73
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:11,520
So off that preview div but inside of this div I'll then add my button and they're all just say pick

74
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:12,760
image.

75
00:06:12,810 --> 00:06:19,020
Now of course we have to set a tie up here and I'll set this to type buttons so that it doesn't accidentally

76
00:06:19,020 --> 00:06:23,900
submit any form which we might have around our image upload component later.

77
00:06:24,210 --> 00:06:26,700
And I will of course add on click listener.

78
00:06:27,150 --> 00:06:32,500
So does on click prop to point at a function that should execute when the button is clicked and for

79
00:06:32,500 --> 00:06:39,620
it we can add a function here to pick image handler the pick image handlers should be triggered whenever

80
00:06:39,620 --> 00:06:46,550
we click this button and in the pic image handler I in the end want to make sure that we opened this

81
00:06:46,550 --> 00:06:52,940
built in file pictures so that we utilize this input component which is invisible but which if we could

82
00:06:52,940 --> 00:07:01,010
click it would open up a file picture so therefore to simulate a click on this we have to get access

83
00:07:01,010 --> 00:07:07,340
to this input element and then just call its click method and to get access we can use a reference so

84
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:14,630
we can import use ref from react and now not use it to store some value which survives re render cycles

85
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:20,570
but instead to store of value which well which actually does survive re render cycles but which most

86
00:07:20,570 --> 00:07:24,190
importantly establishes a connection to a dom element.

87
00:07:24,260 --> 00:07:31,430
So here I'll have my file pick a ref created with use ref and set us here on input by adding the ref

88
00:07:31,460 --> 00:07:35,240
key and pointing at file pick the ref here and then Andy pick.

89
00:07:35,240 --> 00:07:42,200
Image handler we can use file pick a ref dot current and then called a click method.

90
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:48,260
This method exists on this Dom note and it will open up that file picker so we utilize the input element

91
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:49,880
without seeing it.

92
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,020
That's my idea here now.

93
00:07:53,030 --> 00:07:59,990
When this gets clicked you file picture opens and once the user chooses a file on change fires on this

94
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:00,860
input.

95
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,790
So here we have to provide a function that should be triggered once user picked a file.

96
00:08:05,810 --> 00:08:13,670
So here I'll add my picked handler function where I get an event object and I will wire this up to on.

97
00:08:13,700 --> 00:08:14,930
Change here.

98
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:23,390
Picked handler and now here in the picked handler the goal is to generate something that helps us preview

99
00:08:23,420 --> 00:08:25,580
that file down there.

100
00:08:25,580 --> 00:08:32,540
And of course to then also forward the file to the surrounding component where we use the image upload

101
00:08:32,540 --> 00:08:40,480
component in so for the moment here I'll just cancel log event dot target which is the file input in

102
00:08:40,480 --> 00:08:42,770
the end and see what's in there.

103
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:50,200
And now let's go to our off page here and import this component of course we're not done with it yet

104
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:52,730
but for the moment we can already use it.

105
00:08:52,870 --> 00:09:00,860
So I'll import image upload from shared components form elements.

106
00:09:00,990 --> 00:09:07,980
Image upload and use that here in the off page there.

107
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:15,660
My idea is that just as with the name the name and put here I only want to show this image upload button.

108
00:09:15,670 --> 00:09:22,660
If we are in sign up mode so I'll have the same check here if we're not in logging mode then I want

109
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:25,700
to render image upload like this.

110
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:28,240
And for the moment it can be as simple as that.

111
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,660
I'll just forward an idea here and that's the image idea.

112
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:35,410
This idea will be picked up in the image upload component.

113
00:09:35,410 --> 00:09:37,920
For example I bind it here to this input.

114
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:45,630
If we now save that and this reloads and we go to authenticate and switch to sign up mode we see our

115
00:09:45,630 --> 00:09:48,500
file picture here.

116
00:09:48,540 --> 00:09:52,050
Now it would be nice if dev would be centered so back in the off page.

117
00:09:52,140 --> 00:10:00,160
I will add this center prop to image upload and now if I switch back to sign up we see does centered.

118
00:10:00,340 --> 00:10:06,180
Now that's nice but of course this doesn't look that great seeing while no image at all.

119
00:10:06,330 --> 00:10:13,210
But what we can already see is if I click pic image this file picture your opened up automatically and

120
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,410
I can select an image there and there after you see this log on the right which locks this while this

121
00:10:19,410 --> 00:10:23,450
file picker element Q to develop a console.

122
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,450
So this is generally working.

123
00:10:25,470 --> 00:10:31,950
Now we have to work on managing this file correctly true getting a preview and getting it into our form

124
00:10:31,950 --> 00:10:34,260
here so that we can submit this in the end.
