1
00:00:02,070 --> 00:00:07,320
Before we conclude this module though let's have another look at our code and see if we can clean up

2
00:00:07,320 --> 00:00:11,870
some things if we have some redundant code and so on because we changed a lot for this module.

3
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,800
Therefore let's make sure to keep the code as lean as possible you appear.

4
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:19,490
The first thing I see is our dummy places part.

5
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:26,460
I don't think we need this anymore so let's delete these right here immediately.

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,200
I think this outcome and that code can also be removed here.

7
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:33,770
We also got some out commented code.

8
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,410
I think we can also get rid of this right here.

9
00:00:37,580 --> 00:00:41,620
Also this part then let's see here.

10
00:00:41,620 --> 00:00:44,620
Yeah we could actually leave the places here to be honest.

11
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:46,190
As this is just an alternative way.

12
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:53,370
So let me maybe add our previous syntax you to once again just to make sure you can refer to it.

13
00:00:53,390 --> 00:01:01,010
So this was the previous logic we had before we changed our approach to populate method here in the

14
00:01:01,010 --> 00:01:02,900
last lecture.

15
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,690
So I just keep this as a reference here.

16
00:01:05,930 --> 00:01:10,870
So this should be helpful I hope this looks all good for me.

17
00:01:11,300 --> 00:01:14,820
Maybe also formed our code a bit here.

18
00:01:15,260 --> 00:01:21,540
This and the rest looks fine for me at this stage.

19
00:01:21,590 --> 00:01:23,870
Here we again have some cold.

20
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:25,010
We don't need any more.

21
00:01:25,100 --> 00:01:28,290
So let's delete this one yeah.

22
00:01:28,340 --> 00:01:32,500
And I think the rest of this file looks all right so we can keep this code.

23
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:35,210
Let's also have a quick look at our users controller here.

24
00:01:35,210 --> 00:01:41,090
Here we also have some dummy information so let's delete our dummy users as we don't need these anymore.

25
00:01:41,090 --> 00:01:46,510
Could also get rid of you you idea actually we don't need that idea generator.

26
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:48,300
So this looks okay now.

27
00:01:49,210 --> 00:01:52,320
And if I look for the code does generally looks quite fine.

28
00:01:52,330 --> 00:01:55,500
I don't think we have any more dummy code in here.

29
00:01:55,540 --> 00:01:58,360
Same thing for place J Yes I guess this looks also good.

30
00:01:58,420 --> 00:02:01,590
And also I'll use the tree as file looks all right.

31
00:02:01,750 --> 00:02:06,200
Let's also check the places roads quickly whether we have any kind of comments here.

32
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:09,250
Note This looks OK and in use those roads.

33
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:11,400
Yeah here we have test a test outcome.

34
00:02:11,410 --> 00:02:13,430
I guess this code can also be removed.

35
00:02:13,450 --> 00:02:20,290
This old commented code and in the aptly us file we can also get rid of this I'll come into your code

36
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:20,860
here.

37
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,580
I would say but the rest looks alright with that.

38
00:02:24,580 --> 00:02:30,190
We really arrived at the end of this module now and now is finally the time to conclude what we learned.
