00:00:02.340 --> 00:00:08.050
To get prettier buttons I got something prepared for you in the shared components folder.

2
00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:11.930
Add a new sub folder which you can name form elements here.

3
00:00:11.940 --> 00:00:18.160
I want to store some components which are helpful with creating forms or with user interaction and they

4
00:00:18.160 --> 00:00:23.910
are attached to find a button zip file which you can extract and which you can unzip and in there you'll

5
00:00:23.910 --> 00:00:24.510
find a button.

6
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:29.740
She isn't a button C is as follows what you should move into this form elements file.

7
00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.250
Now let's have a brief look at what you get in there.

8
00:00:32.250 --> 00:00:39.420
You get a component and a button component I render different things based on the props we receive.

9
00:00:39.600 --> 00:00:46.530
If we have a ref prop I render a normal anchor ref a normal link if we have a two prop I render a link

10
00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:53.730
as it's coming from react ruder Dom and I also give users the option of adding some special styles for

11
00:00:53.730 --> 00:00:57.020
example controlling the size of the button inverse stranger.

12
00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:58.640
We'll use that for all the course.

13
00:00:58.650 --> 00:01:03.410
No worries there also are some default clauses attached for some nice styling.

14
00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:09.120
And of course I always render a normal button if we have neither a two nor a ref prop.

15
00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:14.490
Then we render a normal button where we can alter control to type for word on click listener and even

16
00:01:14.490 --> 00:01:15.240
disable it.

17
00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:19.820
This is a button and here we get some styles for that button so that it hopefully looks nice.

18
00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:26.810
Now with that we can use this button in the place item component instead of the buttons I currently

19
00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.460
render dear so let's import this button component here.

20
00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:37.000
Import button from shared components form elements.

21
00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:39.980
Button and replace the buttons down there.

22
00:01:40.970 --> 00:01:46.850
With the batter button with the custom button now the buttons can be configured and for viewing map

23
00:01:46.970 --> 00:01:54.210
I want to add to inverse prop which makes this look better in my opinion and displays here for editing.

24
00:01:54.260 --> 00:02:00.020
I don't want to add any inverse prop but I want to add the two prop because this would actually be a

25
00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:04.400
link which redirects the user to a page that allows us to do the editing

26
00:02:07.390 --> 00:02:07.920
so here.

27
00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:14.830
I will add a template literal and then forward to let's say places Slash.

28
00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.030
And then here.

29
00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:22.120
Prop start I.D. which is the idea of that place so that this leads us to slash places slash place idea

30
00:02:22.450 --> 00:02:23.040
which is our route.

31
00:02:23.050 --> 00:02:27.760
We haven't registered yet but which we will add later and for deleting.

32
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:34.720
I will add the danger prop which colors this Spartan rad and more dangerous and we will also soon add

33
00:02:34.750 --> 00:02:37.740
on click listeners to the first and the last button.

34
00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.840
With that I think that looks a bit nicer and we can now focus on making sure that when we click on view

35
00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:50.800
on map we actually will open an overlay let's say where we highlight the position of this place on a

36
00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:51.160
map.
