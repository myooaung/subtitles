00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.380
I want to start with these two buttons and I want to get rid of them for not authenticated.

2
00:00:07.380 --> 00:00:14.220
So in place item which is where we have these buttons we're interested in the context.

3
00:00:14.340 --> 00:00:29.860
So here use context and then let's import the of context from shared context of context and ask before

4
00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:34.950
create our off object here by using used context and listening to off context.

5
00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:41.710
So now we have access to the off context here in place item we can now use that here to control our

6
00:00:41.710 --> 00:00:48.370
buttons not these buttons though these buttons here edit and delete and I want to make sure that only

7
00:00:48.370 --> 00:00:54.040
if off is logged in is true I am able to see these buttons.

8
00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:57.970
So the edit button is only visible in that case and the same here.

9
00:00:57.970 --> 00:01:02.480
Only if all is logged in is true we should be able to see the delete button.

10
00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:06.280
Hence if I save that and just reload you see I don't see the buttons.

11
00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:12.360
If I now log in though like this and I go to a place I see them.

12
00:01:12.420 --> 00:01:13.820
So that's nice.

13
00:01:13.920 --> 00:01:20.760
Now it would also be nice to have a logout button so for Dad we can go to NAV links and add one here

14
00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:23.670
maybe at the very end of the unordered list.

15
00:01:23.670 --> 00:01:29.700
I will check if off is locked in is a thing because a logout button only makes sense if we are logged

16
00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:30.550
in.

17
00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:33.900
And in that case I'll add a new list item here with a button in it.

18
00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:38.200
Actually a regular but now of course you maybe created your own solution here.

19
00:01:38.210 --> 00:01:46.060
I'll go for a regular button and on this button I'll have a caption of log out and I'll point a click

20
00:01:46.930 --> 00:01:51.300
I want to trigger off log out I'll not execute it here.

21
00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:57.300
Instead I'd just point at it so that when the button is clicked this is executed with that if we saved

22
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:04.410
as you can log in here and now we have to log out button here with some default styling because of the

23
00:02:04.410 --> 00:02:06.690
CSA s which already is set up there.

24
00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:10.230
When we click that we are logged out.

25
00:02:10.230 --> 00:02:12.800
Now let's see if we also are redirected.

26
00:02:12.870 --> 00:02:15.430
If I'm on ADD place and a click log out.

27
00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.560
Yeah I'm back to authenticate.

28
00:02:17.850 --> 00:02:19.940
So this all seems to work just fine.

29
00:02:19.950 --> 00:02:26.370
And of course it's not the full real final log inflow yet there is more we will have to manage there

30
00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:33.510
but for the moment this will do and deserves a good introduction to react to building a full app with

31
00:02:33.510 --> 00:02:34.030
react.

32
00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:42.000
And now also to how you can manage app wide state in react with help of the context feature.
