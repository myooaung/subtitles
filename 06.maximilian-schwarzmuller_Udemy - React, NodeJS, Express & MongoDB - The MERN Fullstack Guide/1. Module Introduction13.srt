00:00:02,190 --> 00:00:08,330
Welcome to this optional module in this module we will refresh our knowledge on mongo TB and Mongoose.

2
00:00:08,730 --> 00:00:13,150
So if you have some prior experience on these technologies you might want to skip this module.

3
00:00:13,170 --> 00:00:17,410
But in case you're totally new to Hmong would you be in Mongoose or if you want to refresh your knowledge.

4
00:00:17,550 --> 00:00:20,880
This module contains all the required information.

5
00:00:20,980 --> 00:00:24,850
The monkey is a database and we can connect Mongo TB to our backend.

6
00:00:24,870 --> 00:00:30,360
In our case the node expressed back and and stored information in this database mongoose will help us

7
00:00:30,360 --> 00:00:35,520
to easily manage the connection between the backend and the database will dive into that of course for

8
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:35,750
all.

9
00:00:35,780 --> 00:00:36,610
Module.

10
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:37,810
Now what's in this module now.

11
00:00:37,950 --> 00:00:40,460
Well in this module we learned what Mongo DB is.

12
00:00:40,470 --> 00:00:45,780
We'll set up a so-called with TB cluster the Hmong would be server in the end and we'll set up a simple

13
00:00:45,780 --> 00:00:50,910
node and express AB and see how we can then interact between our backend and this Hmong would you be

14
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,990
database.

15
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:58,080
But then if I look at Mongoose and will understand what Mongoose models are these models help us to

16
00:00:58,290 --> 00:01:02,220
define a structure for information stored in the Hmong TB database.

17
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:04,160
This is what we will dive into here.

18
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,800
And finally we will see how we can create and access documents stored in our database with mongoose.

19
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,280
That's what's inside this module.

20
00:01:12,330 --> 00:01:13,530
So let's get started.
