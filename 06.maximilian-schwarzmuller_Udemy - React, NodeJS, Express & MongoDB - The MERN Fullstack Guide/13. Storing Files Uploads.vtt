This image here is missing because I deployed a new word to Heroku and the thing is whenever you do

2
00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:12.190
that it in the end restarts your server.

3
00:00:12.190 --> 00:00:18.520
You could say and with that I don't just mean the note process at restarts the entire machine where

4
00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:25.060
your node app is running on kinda off of course and the end users uses a system where multiple apps

5
00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:31.450
sit on one of the same machine but your virtual machine on that machine so to say will be restarted

6
00:00:31.960 --> 00:00:37.940
the same by the way will also happen if you manually restarted here through your console of course.

7
00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:43.560
Or also since we have the free plan the same will also happen every 30 minutes.

8
00:00:43.570 --> 00:00:48.760
Then it goes to sleep which means your virtual machine kind of gets shut down and when a new request

9
00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:50.520
arrives it's restarted.

10
00:00:50.530 --> 00:00:58.940
Now the thing is the files you upload are not persistently stored on you Rocco's service.

11
00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.130
Your code is stored and it's simply restarted when average is required you but your other files like

12
00:01:06.130 --> 00:01:09.160
the uploaded images are not stored.

13
00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.080
Now that's not the same for every hosting provider of course.

14
00:01:13.090 --> 00:01:20.350
For example on a W S if you rent an entire virtual machine which you can manage on your own then files

15
00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.400
are not lost.

16
00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:26.800
When you restarted it really depends on the hosting provider and the exact service and maybe also the

17
00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.690
pricing tier you are using in here Rocco's case.

18
00:01:31.690 --> 00:01:37.930
If you search for Heroku persistent storage for example you'll find a help article where this is explained

19
00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:45.340
and there you also get your recommendation to instead of storing files on the filesystem store files

20
00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:51.780
on dedicated static file hosts like a W SS free and you can always learn how you could adjust your notorious

21
00:01:51.790 --> 00:01:54.560
code to move your files to that host.

22
00:01:54.760 --> 00:02:01.270
So that is something you can look into if you choose a certain hosting provider but again depending

23
00:02:01.270 --> 00:02:07.600
on which provider you are choosing you might also be on one where this isn't an issue because files

24
00:02:07.660 --> 00:02:12.460
are deleted there because maybe you rented an entire server or something like this.

25
00:02:12.460 --> 00:02:15.470
So it really depends on the exact hosting setup you're using.

26
00:02:15.550 --> 00:02:18.100
It just is something you also should be aware of.
