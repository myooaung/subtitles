00:00:02.120 --> 00:00:06.770
So connecting react or front that in general to the database is that a good idea.

2
00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:11.870
Well let me tell you why this is not the case because actually you could say well I got my on my front

3
00:00:11.870 --> 00:00:17.300
end of reacting on a case and I got my database on our database server and now I want to do something

4
00:00:17.300 --> 00:00:17.950
with that database.

5
00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:19.790
I want to store data or fetch data.

6
00:00:19.820 --> 00:00:24.590
Technically this would be possible but the question is is that something you should do.

7
00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:30.350
And the answer is no you shouldn't because this is a highly insecure approach because secure authentication

8
00:00:30.410 --> 00:00:35.930
is not really possible if it directly connect your front to the database because to interact with the

9
00:00:35.930 --> 00:00:38.260
database we need to provide credentials right.

10
00:00:38.270 --> 00:00:42.950
Otherwise we cannot use that database and we could provide these credentials as part of shopfront and

11
00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:43.930
code.

12
00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.650
The problem is that our front end code is running in the browser and therefore anybody can access it

13
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:49.370
in the end.

14
00:00:49.370 --> 00:00:53.590
So with that we would expose our credentials and therefore definitely not what we want.

15
00:00:53.750 --> 00:00:58.970
And this would also expose our full database so people could do more of a database than they're actually

16
00:00:58.970 --> 00:01:00.110
supposed to do.

17
00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:04.340
Therefore connecting react to the database is nothing you should do here.

18
00:01:04.340 --> 00:01:09.080
Therefore we will connect react to our back into our node Express back and react will then send the

19
00:01:09.080 --> 00:01:14.690
request to this back end and then the back end will process information and establish a connection to

20
00:01:14.690 --> 00:01:15.780
the monkey server.

21
00:01:15.920 --> 00:01:22.130
And this is a secure approach because here our credentials will not be exposed and therefore we can

22
00:01:22.370 --> 00:01:24.470
provide a secure authentication.

23
00:01:24.470 --> 00:01:28.610
So that's why we connect not expressed among wouldn't be here because that's a typical approach how

24
00:01:28.610 --> 00:01:35.150
you will use it in a real world an application so that we know what would be is why we use it and why

25
00:01:35.150 --> 00:01:40.790
be connected not to the react app but to our back into our node Express back and therefore let us not

26
00:01:40.790 --> 00:01:42.710
have a look at Hmong DB and set it up.
