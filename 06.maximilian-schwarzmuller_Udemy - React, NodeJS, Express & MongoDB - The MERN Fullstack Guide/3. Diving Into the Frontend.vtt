00:00:02.040 --> 00:00:05.990
Let's take a closer look at the front and the client side the browser side.

2
00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:11.730
I will use these terms interchangeably by the way and that of course is powered by react.

3
00:00:11.760 --> 00:00:18.280
Specifically there we build a react s p a a single page application.

4
00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:25.410
Now this simply means that React is in charge of re rendering everything in the browser.

5
00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:27.090
Only one H Tim L..

6
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:35.280
Page that single page that makes up this single page application is served from some server to the browser

7
00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:41.580
in the end and thereafter react takes over and whenever something needs to be drawn onto the screen

8
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.560
or whenever something needs to change on the screen or needs to be read rendered react we'll do that

9
00:00:47.220 --> 00:00:53.670
for the ad will also handle front end or client side routing with the extra library react router Dom

10
00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:00.810
and this will help us render a totally different React Components react is all about components you

11
00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:07.710
will by the way altogether react refresher in one of the next modules so the react router will help

12
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:15.990
us render React Components based on a path the user enters into the U or L bar off the browser so we

13
00:01:15.990 --> 00:01:22.860
will have the feeling of having multiple pages but in the end it's all react and therefore javascript

14
00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:31.770
re rendering significant parts of our page so of what the user sees when we change the user L or when

15
00:01:31.770 --> 00:01:34.830
we get new data from the back end and so on.

16
00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:43.170
Now in our ReACT application we also typically handles some front end state state in the end is data

17
00:01:43.180 --> 00:01:48.710
you could say that influences what is shown on the screen and when our state changes.

18
00:01:48.810 --> 00:01:54.780
Chances are that we want our rebrand or parts of the screen react is all about managing such state and

19
00:01:54.780 --> 00:02:00.780
it has built in mechanisms to automatically re render the parts of the screen that need to change when

20
00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.980
something changes.

21
00:02:01.980 --> 00:02:09.780
Now for state management we can use react state in class based components we can use hooks relatively

22
00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:17.160
kind of new feature in react and or also for application wide state the redux library.

23
00:02:17.160 --> 00:02:24.180
Now as I mentioned you will get a refresher on react later in the course but it will not dive into every

24
00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:28.180
aspect of react that would be enough for its own course.

25
00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:33.780
And indeed I do have such a standalone react course which I strongly recommend that you have a look

26
00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:36.120
at before you dive into discourse.

27
00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:42.630
Now whenever important part of your react application are of course all these components you build because

28
00:02:42.630 --> 00:02:48.720
react is all about components and how you style those so the styling is all as a part of the front end

29
00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:53.550
work or off the front an application that your application looks good.

30
00:02:53.550 --> 00:02:59.250
Now as I mentioned for the routing we'll use react router Dom and there we can basically set up our

31
00:02:59.250 --> 00:03:06.030
route configuration and then define which react components are rendered for which path we can implement

32
00:03:06.030 --> 00:03:12.270
state management with react hoax with our custom hooks which will all to build out this cause and or

33
00:03:12.270 --> 00:03:16.320
with redux and four components and styling.

34
00:03:16.320 --> 00:03:23.070
We will build in this course some utility and UI components though I will also say that throughout this

35
00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:30.270
course I will also provide some finished UI components to you and some finished styles so that we don't

36
00:03:30.270 --> 00:03:38.280
spend the majority of the time of this course on writing basic button where input components and managing

37
00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:45.490
the style of these components because that's really not the core of react and off this course and they

38
00:03:45.490 --> 00:03:51.330
are for some finished components will be provided to you for this part in general of course we'll build

39
00:03:51.390 --> 00:03:58.050
the entire react application from scratch though and this is what react is about it's all related to

40
00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:02.710
the fraud then how we update it and when things should change there.

41
00:04:02.790 --> 00:04:04.290
Now let's have a look at the back end.
