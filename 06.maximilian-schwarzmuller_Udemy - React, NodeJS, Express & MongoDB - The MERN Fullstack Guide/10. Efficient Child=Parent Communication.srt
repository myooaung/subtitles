1
00:00:02,210 --> 00:00:07,140
You can also pass data back and you still do this with props.

2
00:00:07,250 --> 00:00:15,320
The idea just is that instead of having props that pass in data like a string or an array or an object

3
00:00:15,620 --> 00:00:22,430
to the lower level to the child component as it's also called you pass a callback function from the

4
00:00:22,430 --> 00:00:24,550
parent component to the child component.

5
00:00:24,590 --> 00:00:27,670
So no array or anything like that but a callback function.

6
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:34,550
So here in the app component we could define a new function add new goal handler to name is totally

7
00:00:34,550 --> 00:00:43,100
up to you and I name it handler because it also will kind of be triggered upon an event and here I expect

8
00:00:43,100 --> 00:00:50,640
to get the new goal and then here I can reach out to course goals.

9
00:00:50,650 --> 00:00:58,940
And for example push the new goal into disarray and thereafter console log course goals.

10
00:00:58,950 --> 00:01:06,340
Now we have this function and now we can pass it to new goal via props so there we could add a prop

11
00:01:06,730 --> 00:01:08,650
on at goal.

12
00:01:08,650 --> 00:01:15,490
This is now not an event listener react the fines for all the built in age two male elements we have

13
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:22,270
built in event listeners like for example in the New Gold component on the form we had on submit on

14
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:27,250
a button we have on click on input we also have on click for example because you can also handle click

15
00:01:27,250 --> 00:01:33,010
events on inputs you can handle those on any HD him out element now in the end here I call this an event

16
00:01:33,010 --> 00:01:37,210
handler but what it actually is is just a prop.

17
00:01:37,210 --> 00:01:42,730
Technically there is no difference between class name where I pass in a string and on submit where I

18
00:01:42,730 --> 00:01:45,350
pass in a pointer to a function.

19
00:01:45,670 --> 00:01:51,940
So in the end this is just a prop of the form element which react offers to you.

20
00:01:51,970 --> 00:01:59,230
So here in app yes we can all to pass a prop here on NEW goal which holds a pointer to a function I

21
00:01:59,230 --> 00:02:03,240
just named as prop like this not because I have to.

22
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:12,460
I could name it at goal or this year but it's a convention to name props which the end pass functions

23
00:02:12,460 --> 00:02:19,300
to lower level components like event handlers because the functions you pass down to components in the

24
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,230
end will be called by these components upon certain events.

25
00:02:23,230 --> 00:02:28,330
That is how it typically works and you will see that the more react applications you build.

26
00:02:28,330 --> 00:02:35,350
So therefore I followed this convention and named this on ad goal and passed my ad new goal handler

27
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:43,730
to the new goal component so I pass a pointer not the execution but just a pointer to its function to

28
00:02:43,720 --> 00:02:52,600
a new goal on this on ad goal prop now that means that instead of new goal I can now accept props here

29
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:58,330
I can accept this props parameter I always get it even if I don't get any props but if I don't get any

30
00:02:58,330 --> 00:03:05,080
props there isn't much sense in in explicitly riding it out here but now I need a prop which I'm getting

31
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:12,160
on new goal and that is that on ad gold prop I defined here I want to call that function I receive on

32
00:03:12,160 --> 00:03:16,300
that prop here instead of my ad goal handler in new goal.

33
00:03:16,300 --> 00:03:24,190
So instead of logging the new goal I can now call props on ad goal here on ad goal because that's the

34
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:31,150
name I chose here and on ad goal Pass is a pointer at a function to the component so inside of the new

35
00:03:31,150 --> 00:03:38,080
goal component I know I can execute on ad goal because it holds a pointer to a function so I now execute

36
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,970
that function pointed to and it can pass my new goal as an argument to on that goal because indeed in

37
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:51,850
the function I passed 2 on ad goal I expect to get a new goal as an argument as a parameter.

38
00:03:51,950 --> 00:03:59,310
So now if we save everything we should see the difficulty at goal where outputting something from app

39
00:03:59,310 --> 00:04:06,270
trace lines 16 which is this log here and we're outputting our new course Cole's array which are our

40
00:04:06,390 --> 00:04:08,700
old goals and a new goal.

41
00:04:08,850 --> 00:04:16,050
So passing the goal from the lower level from the child component the new goal component to the parent

42
00:04:16,050 --> 00:04:23,520
component the app component in this case works and it works with props we just use props to parse a

43
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,370
function that is then called by the child components instead of passing data directly from parent to

44
00:04:29,370 --> 00:04:30,080
child.

45
00:04:30,090 --> 00:04:36,240
This gives us a way to communicate back from the child to the parent with help of such a function.
