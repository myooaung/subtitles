1
00:00:02,200 --> 00:00:08,350
Time to update our places now in the great thing now is that we actually learned all the core concepts

2
00:00:08,380 --> 00:00:11,550
we need to do so therefore this should be an easy task now.

3
00:00:11,620 --> 00:00:13,110
Let's do it together though.

4
00:00:13,390 --> 00:00:18,910
So update places as before our first caught here with our error check can be kept.

5
00:00:18,910 --> 00:00:19,990
This is fine.

6
00:00:19,990 --> 00:00:24,600
The same thing is true for the properties here that we want to get from our request body.

7
00:00:24,610 --> 00:00:25,410
This is fine.

8
00:00:25,420 --> 00:00:26,920
Parents can also be kept.

9
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:30,600
But this part here with dummy places this has to be replaced.

10
00:00:30,610 --> 00:00:35,270
Now as we have real data in our database now the update logic right here.

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,410
Well we'll have a look at that in a few seconds.

12
00:00:37,510 --> 00:00:43,450
And what I can see right here is this dummy place should of course also be delete it now.

13
00:00:43,480 --> 00:00:44,350
So how do we start.

14
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:51,610
Well Indiana updating a place simply means that we want to get the place by the police idea and then

15
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:54,730
update the title and the description.

16
00:00:54,730 --> 00:01:04,230
Now as I'm talking about finding the place Spidey place idea we can again use our fine by I.D. method

17
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:08,010
we had up here for to get police I.D. constant.

18
00:01:08,010 --> 00:01:11,260
This also means that we will use the same try catch block again.

19
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,560
Therefore we can from the start use the same logic in the enviornment here.

20
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:19,720
So we will implement it try catch block from the beginning now though.

21
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:29,070
So let's go down and let's not say that we again have our place variable here let this time not a concert

22
00:01:29,190 --> 00:01:33,330
as we start with our try catch block inside try.

23
00:01:33,330 --> 00:01:38,670
We have our place once again which we use right here which we just defined and place should be equal

24
00:01:38,670 --> 00:01:42,610
to place dot find by I.D..

25
00:01:42,870 --> 00:01:44,290
That's the same logic we just saw.

26
00:01:44,610 --> 00:01:46,260
And what did it that you want to find.

27
00:01:46,260 --> 00:01:49,980
Well that's of course our place I.D. here.

28
00:01:50,010 --> 00:01:54,850
This one updating places once again is an asynchronous task.

29
00:01:54,870 --> 00:02:02,820
Therefore don't forget to add a sync up here and a weight down there.

30
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:05,950
With that we have to catch any error.

31
00:02:05,950 --> 00:02:07,550
Case here.

32
00:02:08,110 --> 00:02:15,430
If we have an error let's again stored in a constant here should be equal to the new HDB error.

33
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:21,770
And there should state something went wrong.

34
00:02:21,770 --> 00:02:32,840
Could not update police error code would again be five hundred and we should not forget to add return

35
00:02:33,140 --> 00:02:34,380
next.

36
00:02:34,380 --> 00:02:35,950
Error here.

37
00:02:36,020 --> 00:02:37,520
So this looks final already.

38
00:02:37,580 --> 00:02:38,590
With that we have to change.

39
00:02:38,630 --> 00:02:42,780
Updated place to place down here as we refer to place up here.

40
00:02:43,190 --> 00:02:50,360
Therefore we can also use place when it comes to updating the title and the description and what is

41
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:51,190
missing now.

42
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:56,060
Well storing the updated place of course at the moment you're just sending back a response which you

43
00:02:56,060 --> 00:02:57,110
also have to adjust.

44
00:02:57,170 --> 00:03:03,470
But we also have to make sure that the updated information is stored again in our database for that

45
00:03:03,500 --> 00:03:07,920
we can again use the safe method which you also used before when we created the place.

46
00:03:07,940 --> 00:03:18,140
And as we know safe is an asynchronous task therefore we will again use try catch and now await our

47
00:03:18,140 --> 00:03:22,440
place safe method to safe this updated place.

48
00:03:22,610 --> 00:03:27,710
And in case we have an error we'll again catch it you'll see it's kind of the same process we have here

49
00:03:27,950 --> 00:03:29,980
for all these tasks.

50
00:03:30,020 --> 00:03:33,080
And here we can say something went wrong

51
00:03:35,650 --> 00:03:47,350
could not update place and again a 500 error code and also don't forget to return next arrow down here

52
00:03:47,860 --> 00:03:50,890
to make sure the code execution is interrupted.

53
00:03:50,890 --> 00:03:51,580
What's missing here.

54
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:57,430
Well we should again convert our Mongoose object to a normal javascript object and we should get rid

55
00:03:57,550 --> 00:04:03,490
of our underscore ideas of the underscore of the eddy property to be more precise right here.

56
00:04:03,490 --> 00:04:09,470
For that we will refer to place dot to object.

57
00:04:09,470 --> 00:04:14,960
Here we can use this method directly as we are not having an error here as we had it before when we

58
00:04:15,170 --> 00:04:17,920
were getting the place by the user I.D..

59
00:04:18,500 --> 00:04:26,890
And now we can set getters to rue that save this.

60
00:04:26,890 --> 00:04:32,340
And let's not see what happens if we want to update the please for that I'll create a new request right

61
00:04:32,340 --> 00:04:32,880
here.

62
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:40,280
This time it will be a petty request to age to DP local host

63
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:53,140
not user places slash the idea of our place so let's take the idea down here

64
00:04:56,430 --> 00:04:58,290
and it's pasted.

65
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,380
Now we need to go to body.

66
00:05:00,510 --> 00:05:03,810
Raul and Jason once again.

67
00:05:04,150 --> 00:05:08,810
Now we have to add the title and the description that we want to change.

68
00:05:09,110 --> 00:05:15,710
For that let's say the title should be the Empire State Building.

69
00:05:15,710 --> 00:05:18,030
Before we had Empire State Building.

70
00:05:18,260 --> 00:05:24,220
And that is Rob junior should be.

71
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:25,670
Well what do we have at the moment.

72
00:05:25,670 --> 00:05:28,120
Here we have a very famous building.

73
00:05:28,310 --> 00:05:29,050
Let's say

74
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:35,910
a great building like this.

75
00:05:35,970 --> 00:05:43,390
So we have the two properties so if we sent the pets requests now we can see that it was successful

76
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:44,760
and we have the title.

77
00:05:44,810 --> 00:05:49,250
The Empire State Building and the description was also changed to a great building.

78
00:05:49,250 --> 00:05:50,970
So this also works fine now.

79
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,810
Let's not also have a look at our database and as you can see we also have the Empire State Building

80
00:05:56,930 --> 00:05:57,960
and a great building.

81
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,510
So our database was also updated successfully.

82
00:06:02,510 --> 00:06:04,710
With that we have create read update.

83
00:06:04,760 --> 00:06:08,030
What's missing now is deleting documents in our database.
