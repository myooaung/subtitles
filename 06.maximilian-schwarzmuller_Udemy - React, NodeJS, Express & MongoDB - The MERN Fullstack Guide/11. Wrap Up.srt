00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,370
This is 8 4 to file upload adding file upload has two sides.

2
00:00:07,370 --> 00:00:09,450
For one we need to add it on the back end.

3
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:15,380
Here we used to Malta package and the middleware it offers to us configured for our needs.

4
00:00:15,380 --> 00:00:21,380
So we're configuring the place where it's stored how to file name is named and which files we accept.

5
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,180
We do this with the help of the MIME type map.

6
00:00:24,410 --> 00:00:31,190
Then in the controllers we simply extract the path which Malta gives us automatically and stored that

7
00:00:31,190 --> 00:00:31,970
in the database.

8
00:00:31,970 --> 00:00:36,860
So not the file is stored but just the path off the file just a string.

9
00:00:36,860 --> 00:00:42,410
We don't want to store files in the database because Deadwood bloated slow it down and be a really bad

10
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:49,940
practice store files on the file system locally instead now in case something goes wrong.

11
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:54,330
We have app J.S. where we roll back our file upload.

12
00:00:54,330 --> 00:00:58,410
If the request where something went wrong has a file attached to it.

13
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:01,620
So if some other request goes wrong we don't roll it back.

14
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:08,600
Of course and on the front that we built this new image upload component which allows us to pick an

15
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:14,450
image and all to show up preview and we easily integrated this into our existing form.

16
00:01:14,450 --> 00:01:20,150
Look at the for management we have in place already and then the trick just was to use forum data to

17
00:01:20,150 --> 00:01:27,260
submit the data to the back end so that we can have a mixture of text and binary data and that is it.

18
00:01:27,260 --> 00:01:29,990
This is file upload added to emerge an app.
