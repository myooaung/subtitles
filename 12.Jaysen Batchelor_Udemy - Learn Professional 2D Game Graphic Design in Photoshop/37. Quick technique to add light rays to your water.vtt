00:00:00.450 --> 00:00:04.360
Next we're going to create some light rays in our water.

00:00:04.600 --> 00:00:09.560
And the way we'll do that is we're going to add a new layer underneath our yellow layer.

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:17.700
And using a brush tool with the color white and a hard edge we are going to create some random dots

00:00:17.790 --> 00:00:28.950
along our water line like so then we're going to shrink our brush down and we're going to create some

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:30.150
smaller dots

00:00:32.820 --> 00:00:35.890
.

00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:45.600
So now what we want to come up to our filters blurred and then we're going to come down to motion blur

00:00:45.630 --> 00:00:46.240
.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:54.990
And what that does is it gives us a nice sweeping blur across our image and right here with this wheel

00:00:55.020 --> 00:00:57.160
we can change the angle of our blar.

00:00:57.180 --> 00:01:01.440
We want to be at about 40 negative 40 degrees

00:01:03.770 --> 00:01:05.680
.

00:01:05.820 --> 00:01:12.390
There is good and we want a distance throe of 500 pixels then press OK.

00:01:13.020 --> 00:01:15.720
Now we're going to drag our late light rays down

00:01:19.650 --> 00:01:26.820
like so then we want to delete any light rays that are coming outside of the water.

00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:31.150
So we'll select our water shape invert the selection and the

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:43.430
next using our research with a soft edge and we're going to put the opacity down to four.

00:01:43.550 --> 00:01:50.100
We're going to erase the edges of our light rays away so they just sort of fade into the water

00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:56.980
.
