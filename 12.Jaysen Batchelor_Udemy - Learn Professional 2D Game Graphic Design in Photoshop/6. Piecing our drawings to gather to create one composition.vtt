00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:06.180
Now that we've finished our drawings Let's go ahead and piece them together.

00:00:06.180 --> 00:00:15.000
I've created a new document that is 1920 by 10 80 pixels and its resolution is 70.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:22.500
So let's grab our first drawn with the marquee tool and let's copy it by going.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.090
Control see on your keyboard for a Mac.

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:27.620
It's command.

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:32.580
C it's come back toward new document and paste that in

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:38.160
Alice in large this

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:50.560
thing that should be about good.

00:00:50.580 --> 00:00:53.940
Now we're going to need to cut this mountain out or that.

00:00:54.040 --> 00:01:00.240
Now this mountain but this island because right now it's on a white background if I turn off the background

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:03.350
of this document you'll see there's still white around it.

00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:10.320
So let's cut them out with the last tool and let's make sure we're using the polygon a lasso tool and

00:01:10.320 --> 00:01:12.800
we'll just select around them.

00:01:13.250 --> 00:01:18.900
Does doesn't have to be perfect we just need to get this white space out of the way so when we put the

00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:25.310
castle behind it we will be able to see it.

00:01:29.670 --> 00:01:30.600
It's probably good enough

00:01:38.570 --> 00:01:41.940
turn the background back on but scriber castle now

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:51.610
let's slide his layer behind the island

00:01:53.940 --> 00:01:56.910
and let's shrink them down

00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:04.200
.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:13.460
This part of the game is all about resizing and moving pieces around the page.

00:02:13.590 --> 00:02:14.470
We just need to make.

00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:17.520
We just need to get that ice composition going

00:02:26.840 --> 00:02:28.360
grab our floating islands.

00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:32.040
Now it's actually cut them out one at a time with our Lasso tool

00:02:32.070 --> 00:03:31.460
.

00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:33.610
Now let's add our water line.

00:03:33.750 --> 00:03:38.070
I'm thinking it's going to be right above this window.

00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:46.260
So remember it's shift holding down shift while you're painting to create a straight line.

00:03:46.430 --> 00:03:48.450
Whoops.

00:03:48.810 --> 00:03:49.470
Some do that.

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:59.560
Let's add a new layer for the water line and this layer will be on top of all the other layers.

00:04:03.540 --> 00:04:04.330
All right.

00:04:04.380 --> 00:04:10.290
And there is our basic lay out for our background and we can add in the trees.

00:04:10.320 --> 00:04:12.140
But I don't think we're going to do that yet.

00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:18.990
We'll leave that for later if your drawn along with me then you can go ahead and do this with your own

00:04:18.990 --> 00:04:20.660
drawings if you'd like.

00:04:20.670 --> 00:04:26.130
You can use the drawings that were included with this course and you can just resize them and put them

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:27.840
into position to practice
