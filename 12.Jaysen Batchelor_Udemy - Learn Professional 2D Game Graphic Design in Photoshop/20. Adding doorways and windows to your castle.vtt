00:00:00.690 --> 00:00:06.230
All right guys we're going to go ahead and make some doors and windows for our castle.

00:00:06.480 --> 00:00:15.540
So let's create a new layer above our cylinders and then using our Lasso tool we are going to create

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:20.250
the shape of a doorway.

00:00:27.060 --> 00:00:39.810
Then we're gonna fill that in with a dark blue to go with something like that.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:50.310
Then using our brush tool with a hard edge we're going to grab a little bit lighter blue

00:00:55.350 --> 00:01:02.980
than holding clicking and holding down shift and clicking oops Let's bring our capacity up.

00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:05.030
Try that again.

00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:14.170
I'm going to create two lines across the top of our doorway.

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:20.060
Awesome.

00:01:20.070 --> 00:01:27.900
Now let's create our windows so we'll add a new layer then with our marquee tool will create a rectangle

00:01:28.440 --> 00:01:37.290
and will fill that in with our dark color and this doorway.

00:01:37.290 --> 00:01:43.500
Then we'll come back to our blue color and using our brush.

00:01:43.500 --> 00:01:46.980
We're going to create a line down the side

00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:59.730
and then we'll grab a little bit lighter of a color are actually going to go with this color and we're

00:01:59.730 --> 00:02:04.860
going to create a line on the top like so

00:02:08.070 --> 00:02:18.870
now let's select that and copy it paste it then we'll go command T and then we're going to flip it horizontal

00:02:20.610 --> 00:02:28.080
like that and we'll grab him and put some distance between them.

00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.190
Then we're going to merge those layers.

00:02:35.370 --> 00:02:36.420
Now we'll grab them

00:02:39.930 --> 00:02:41.730
then using our command.

00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.860
We're going to shrink them down a bit

00:02:49.930 --> 00:02:52.980
then and we're going to warp them

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:01.290
and we just want to warp them to the curve of our cylinder

00:03:12.210 --> 00:03:13.780
just like that.

00:03:15.150 --> 00:03:16.080
And we move them up

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:26.400
and creating our doorways and windows are as simple as that
