Have guys my name is Jason Batchelor And I will be your instructor along course for creating grounds

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:11.610
for games and animation a little bit about myself.

00:00:11.640 --> 00:00:18.330
I mean freelance illustrator and design I've done the animation studio before as a background artist

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:22.480
and I've also been a graphic designer Alisson.

00:00:23.210 --> 00:00:31.570
I'm going to take a little walk through what we're doing with the design since we're walking through

00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:39.630
thumbnail sketches brainstorming and after that we're going to create our final sketch and once we do

00:00:39.630 --> 00:00:42.310
that we add value to our background.

00:00:42.330 --> 00:00:48.090
After that we can jump right in and start building the pieces of our background you'll see it come together

00:00:48.450 --> 00:00:50.040
for you.

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:55.810

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:11.610
for Photoshop that you can use in your backgrounds or whatever you want whenever you want.

00:01:11.610 --> 00:01:18.800
