00:00:01.140 --> 00:00:06.150
Never have shown you these few tools I'm going to show you a quick little trick that will speed up the

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:08.480
process of creating digital art.

00:00:08.820 --> 00:00:13.710
Now this trick is called hockeys and you've probably heard of them before and what they are is they're

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:20.120
just keys on your keyboard that you will press that will quickly bring up a tool for you.

00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:26.610
So rather than you having to physically bring your cursor over to the tool and clicking on it you can

00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:30.560
press a key on your keyboard and it will automatically bring that tool up.

00:00:30.570 --> 00:00:37.200
So let's start with the grab and move tools so right now we have the marquee tool selected.

00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.250
But if we want to grab and move to selected all we have to do is press its hot key to bring it up.

00:00:43.440 --> 00:00:47.750
So the Graben moved tools hot key is the letter V.

00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:54.300
So if we press the letter V on our keyboard it will bring up the grab and move tool.

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.230
So now we can grab and move our image around the page.

00:01:00.270 --> 00:01:06.540
Now the next tool the marquee tool the hot key for that one is M And so let's press em.

00:01:07.140 --> 00:01:08.760
And that brings up the marquee tool.

00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:11.340
So now we can drag and select an area.

00:01:11.730 --> 00:01:20.130
Now the last tool is the Lasso tool and the as you can probably guess the hot key for that is the letter

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:20.640
L.

00:01:20.640 --> 00:01:22.730
So let's press the letter L.

00:01:23.220 --> 00:01:26.470
And that brings up our last tool.

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:28.790
So now go ahead and give that a whirl.

00:01:28.790 --> 00:01:36.120
Practice a while with these hotkeys and it's going to be a little bit difficult at first but trust me

00:01:36.360 --> 00:01:40.410
over time you will get the hang of it and you won't even have to think about it it will become second

00:01:40.410 --> 00:01:43.640
nature and you will become so fast that it.

00:01:44.010 --> 00:01:45.570
So go out and practice.

00:01:45.630 --> 00:01:48.770
And we can move on to the next part of our course.
