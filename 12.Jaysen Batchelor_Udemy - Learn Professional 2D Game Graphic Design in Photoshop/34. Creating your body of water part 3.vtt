00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:09.480
Next we're going to create a new layer and with a large brush with a soft edge we are going to create

00:00:09.510 --> 00:00:13.870
a blue line across the bottom of our background.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:15.460
This is the color we'll be using

00:00:18.690 --> 00:00:23.460
and make sure that your layer is above the previous layer that we made

00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:34.720
then we're going to bring down the opacity to about 35.

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:37.370
Next will add a new layer.

00:00:37.860 --> 00:00:43.320
Then we'll come up to our waterline layer and using our wand select tool.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:49.080
We're going to select the area above our two squiggly lines and then holding down shift.

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:53.490
We're going to select the area underneath our squiggly lines.

00:00:53.730 --> 00:01:02.130
Then we're going to invert the selection and fill that with the same color that are squiggly lines are

00:01:02.130 --> 00:01:04.710
made out of.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:11.930
We need to create a new layer for them first underneath our waterline like so.

00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:20.190
Next we're going to turn down the opacity on that.

00:01:20.190 --> 00:01:31.140
Now we're going to create a new layer that will be underneath both our waterline layers and we are going

00:01:31.140 --> 00:01:39.960
to select our water shape and we're going to fill it with this yellow color.

00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:42.150
So go ahead and fill that

00:01:44.880 --> 00:01:53.020
then we're going to put the layer on overlay and bring down the opacity to about 15 percent.
