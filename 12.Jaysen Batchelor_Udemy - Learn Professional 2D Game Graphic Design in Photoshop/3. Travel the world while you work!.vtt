00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.600
Now the reason why freelancing sites are so great is because of the fact that you can work from anywhere

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:12.580
in the world with anyone in the world as long as you have a Wi-Fi connection.

00:00:12.810 --> 00:00:19.990
That means that you have a very very large pool of employers and projects that you can take from.

00:00:20.010 --> 00:00:22.500
Let me show you down here at the bottom.

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:26.010
They have a they tell you how many jobs are posted at this time.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.340
And right now it's almost 8.5 million.

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:32.200
That is a ton of jobs.

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:37.470
So if you wanted to travel the world and work at the same time this is definitely a way you could do

00:00:37.470 --> 00:00:37.980
it.

00:00:38.220 --> 00:00:39.790
Let me show you where the work is.

00:00:39.810 --> 00:00:44.350
So if you come up here to the work tab and we come down to browse projects.

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.430
Whoops I accidentally clicked something else.

00:00:48.480 --> 00:00:49.530
Try that again.

00:00:49.560 --> 00:00:51.130
So we come to the work tab.

00:00:51.410 --> 00:00:53.220
We go to browse projects

00:00:55.830 --> 00:00:58.820
and that will allow us to search projects.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:01.890
So right now I have the search word game in there.

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.240
And we also want to add some skill tags.

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:07.380
So we're going to put an illustration

00:01:09.870 --> 00:01:14.400
and a graphic design.

00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:15.120
Great.

00:01:15.300 --> 00:01:21.270
So now you'll see it gives us a bunch of jobs that have the word game in them and have the skill sets

00:01:21.270 --> 00:01:27.690
of illustration and graphic design and you'll see they just go on for ever and ever.

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:31.750
Not really but they there are a lot of jobs.

00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:37.620
Let's find one that we want to take a look at.

00:01:41.460 --> 00:01:46.850
Let's have a look at this guy.

00:01:47.430 --> 00:01:51.890
So they have their budget here and they have the average bid for you.

00:01:51.900 --> 00:01:56.810
How many bidders are are at freelancers are betting on it.

00:01:56.850 --> 00:01:59.610
They have the full description here for the project.

00:01:59.910 --> 00:02:03.780
And then if you come down here you can see all the different freelancers that you're going up against

00:02:03.870 --> 00:02:07.860
and you can go to their profile pages and have a look at their portfolios.

00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:13.230
And it's very good way to study your competition and figure out how are you going to differentiate yourself

00:02:13.290 --> 00:02:16.910
from the competition.

00:02:16.950 --> 00:02:22.200
Now if this was a full fledged account it would allow me to bid on the project but I can't because I

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.540
don't have my information in this account.

00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.970
But if it were a real account there would be a button down here that would allow you to bid on the project

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:32.500
and you would just click that and it would come up with a form.

00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:38.280
And on this form you would put in your bid and you would also put in a small message that you would

00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.400
send to the employer stating why you should have the job or what you think you could do for them that

00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:46.570
would benefit them more than everybody else.
