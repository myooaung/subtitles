00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:06.270
So when you're first starting out on the freelancing site you're not going to have any reviews.

00:00:06.300 --> 00:00:08.490
And that's a big part of getting jobs.

00:00:08.490 --> 00:00:13.430
The more views you have the easier it's going to be for you to get jobs and starting out with zero reviews

00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:16.210
is going to make it very difficult to get your first job.

00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:21.330
But I'm going to teach you some techniques and things I did to get my first jobs.

00:00:21.390 --> 00:00:22.470
It's all about hustling.

00:00:22.470 --> 00:00:23.750
At the beginning.

00:00:24.270 --> 00:00:31.140
So one of the things you need to remember is that most people applying for jobs on here in their proposals

00:00:31.230 --> 00:00:36.690
they're just copying and pasting the same exact proposal to every job and you can tell it sounds like

00:00:36.690 --> 00:00:37.540
it when you read it.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:43.440
And I know this because I ran a job on here before and when I got my proposals from all the freelancers

00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:47.780
they just sounded very generic and like they had no idea what my project even was.

00:00:47.790 --> 00:00:54.150
They just clicked on my project pasted in and hoped that maybe I'd pick it up and make and when they

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:57.810
do that on other people's projects they're just hoping somebody will bite.

00:00:58.020 --> 00:01:03.180
And I guess that works for them but for you starting out with your very first job that's not really

00:01:03.180 --> 00:01:05.790
going to work because you're not going to have any reviews.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:10.620
So what you need to do is you need to stand out from the crowd and the way you'll do that is you'll

00:01:10.830 --> 00:01:16.740
actually write a message that has to do with their project not just hi I'm so-and-so.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:18.380
This is what I do.

00:01:18.570 --> 00:01:23.520
Your blah blah you know like you're going to talk about their actual project and ask them questions

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:23.740
.

00:01:23.850 --> 00:01:30.270
Which brings me to another point is that most freelancers on here when they write their proposals they

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:33.200
just talk about themselves and they're like This is what I do.

00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:37.140
These are my credentials and they just talk and talk about themselves.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:43.080
And the thing is the employers they don't really care about you they'd care about their project and

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.810
they care about somebody that can get it done well and that cares about it.

00:01:47.820 --> 00:01:52.870
I mean nobody wants somebody that doesn't care about the project working on a project.

00:01:52.890 --> 00:01:59.070
So when you write your message to them you need to introduce yourself tell them like in one sentence

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:00.090
what you do.

00:02:00.090 --> 00:02:04.290
And after that it's just talking about their project.

00:02:04.290 --> 00:02:11.310
So you say hi my name is Jason Batchelor I'm a freelancer illustrator I work at an animation studio

00:02:11.310 --> 00:02:14.400
and I've been a graphic designer on some games and stuff.

00:02:14.610 --> 00:02:21.150
And after that one sentence maybe two sentences you just talk about then say you products under the

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:24.630
cool I'm really interested in it can you tell me a little bit more about it you know like hit me up

00:02:24.660 --> 00:02:26.170
in the instant messaging box.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:31.200
And that's the way you're going to get those jobs by being somebody that the employers would want to

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.380
work with as well as having a good portfolio.
