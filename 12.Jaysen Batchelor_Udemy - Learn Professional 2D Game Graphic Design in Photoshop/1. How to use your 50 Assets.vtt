00:00:00.840 --> 00:00:06.870
All right let's come back to our 50 assets and I'm going to show you real quick how you can cut these

00:00:06.870 --> 00:00:11.850
out and put them into your backgrounds and play around with the colors and the lightness and darkness

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.530
of them so that they fit into your background.

00:00:15.630 --> 00:00:21.470
So we have our doors folder here and all of our doors are on one layer and they have their shadows.

00:00:21.570 --> 00:00:25.690
But we don't want to worry about the shadows we just want the door its doors layer.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:29.350
And so once we have the layers selected with all the doors on it.

00:00:29.390 --> 00:00:32.080
These are murky tool and we'll just cut one out.

00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:35.750
So let's cut this guy out or don't cut him out.

00:00:35.760 --> 00:00:42.450
But copy it and then we will paste them into our background.

00:00:42.450 --> 00:00:47.580
Now this door looks really small in this background because this background is huge it's like 7000 by

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.230
3000 pixels.

00:00:49.620 --> 00:00:54.030
And that's why this looks so small but when you're working with games you're generally not going to

00:00:54.030 --> 00:00:59.600
be any larger than 1920 by 20.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:09.170
So we'll take our dollar zoom in and we're going to distort them by using Comanche or control t Mago

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.750
to distort.

00:01:10.950 --> 00:01:19.620
And we just want this door to line up with the door in our background already that we have there already

00:01:19.620 --> 00:01:24.600
.

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:26.020
Cool.

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.970
And then for this guy we would want him in black and white.

00:01:29.970 --> 00:01:37.890
So we're going to select him and then go up to Hue and saturations and then we're going to take a saturation

00:01:37.890 --> 00:01:38.810
all the way down.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:44.660
And now he's black and white like the rest of the background but and other backgrounds with color.

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:50.700
Maybe you don't want it to be black and white and you want to actually change the color of your asset

00:01:50.820 --> 00:01:58.140
and the way you can do that is up here with the hues and we can change the color of our door now.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:06.390
We can also change the lightness and the darkness and you can even take some color out of it or you

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:09.820
can bring all the way up like so.

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:14.040
And that's how you would put in assets into your backgrounds.

00:02:14.050 --> 00:02:16.810
Now there's little tiny things that you might have to fix.

00:02:16.860 --> 00:02:21.320
For example since this door is in perspective it's a little door knobs down here.

00:02:21.390 --> 00:02:22.880
They're looking flat.

00:02:22.890 --> 00:02:31.720
And so you might have to paint those out and then create your own little door knobs to go on it.
