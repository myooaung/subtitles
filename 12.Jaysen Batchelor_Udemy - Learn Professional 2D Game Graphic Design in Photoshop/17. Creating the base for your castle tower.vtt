00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.230
Let's go ahead and quickly rename our layers.

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:06.550
So we'll start with this guy.

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:13.320
He's the back of our cavern's whole column Kavran back.

00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:18.120
Call this guy windows shadow

00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:25.680
black eye windows

00:00:25.690 --> 00:00:31.350
.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:41.030
Call this guy cavern shadow.

00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.300
Call this guy

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:54.450
Vern highlight and shadow we'll just put edge s for short.

00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:57.530
Let's start creating our castle.

00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.480
So let's open our castle drawing.

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:09.450
I've done a little test here already and I'll be using that for polar reference so the first thing we

00:01:09.450 --> 00:01:18.000
want to do is we want to add a new layer and using our Lasso tool or one to trace out the shape of our

00:01:18.090 --> 00:01:18.780
cylinder

00:01:21.450 --> 00:01:31.860
that we're going to fill that in with a gradient of this purple and it's blue.

00:01:31.990 --> 00:01:33.060
There's their colors

00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.480
.

00:01:41.010 --> 00:01:42.780
Go ahead and fill that in

00:01:42.780 --> 00:01:50.320
.

00:01:51.090 --> 00:01:56.780
Now let's copy this while we have it selected and then we are going to create a new layer.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:03.030
We'll bring them underneath our drawing and we will piece this guy on it.

00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:09.250
So now we have two and let's call this guy reuse

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:20.550
and then let's put them in a folder so we know not to use them.

00:02:20.870 --> 00:02:24.620
Alright we're going to reuse that a lot in the creation of this castle.

00:02:24.630 --> 00:02:26.980
And that's why we've done that.

00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.220
Let's go ahead and carry on.

00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:34.950
So now we're going to use the marquee tool and use the elliptical marquee tool to create a cylinder

00:02:35.850 --> 00:02:38.510
that is about the width of our shape.

00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:42.360
We just made that we're going to go ahead and fill it with this blue

00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.270
then we're going to resize it to make sure that it does fit.

00:02:51.270 --> 00:02:53.880
Actually it's quite nice under

00:02:57.360 --> 00:03:02.210
us and we've just created our cylinder.

00:03:02.750 --> 00:03:03.470
That was my bad.

00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:09.480
I copied and pasted this before we wanted to use it so we can go ahead and delete that guy.

00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:13.780
And then let's come back up here and now we want to copy and paste them.

00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.120
Now that we have our top on them

00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:24.120
or rename them for us.

00:03:25.090 --> 00:03:26.660
All right.

00:03:27.150 --> 00:03:35.280
Now what we'll do is we will paste another one and this guy we want behind our first one and we're going

00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:39.560
to shrink him down.

00:03:41.120 --> 00:03:41.730
So

00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:49.070
awesome.

00:03:49.070 --> 00:03:55.320
Now let's create a new layer underneath him and using our Lasso tool we are going to trace out this

00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:55.980
triangle

00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.170
and we're going to fill him with this color.

00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:06.750
There's the color

00:04:09.570 --> 00:04:12.760
and then using our work tool.

00:04:13.470 --> 00:04:18.450
We're going to work a curve into him like so

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:28.300
.

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:28.820
All right.

00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:29.760
Awesome.

00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.290
Now let's add one more layer.

00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:35.400
Using the elliptical tool.

00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:42.740
We're going to create an elliptical that is about the width of our cone or triangle

00:04:45.220 --> 00:04:51.270
skin and then we're going to grab this color

00:04:55.710 --> 00:04:56.880
and we'll fill that in

00:04:59.870 --> 00:05:02.250
and we'll bring him up.

00:05:02.340 --> 00:05:11.250
We want to bring him in front of our triangle and then we're going to grab this read once more.

00:05:11.250 --> 00:05:18.540
And then using our brush and making sure we're on a soft brush and we're going to turn our opacity down

00:05:18.540 --> 00:05:19.960
to two.

00:05:20.220 --> 00:05:22.350
We are going to paint a bit of a shadow in

00:05:34.240 --> 00:05:34.760
like so
