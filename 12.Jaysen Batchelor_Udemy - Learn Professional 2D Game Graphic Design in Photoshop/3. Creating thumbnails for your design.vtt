00:00:01.650 --> 00:00:06.750
We're now going to get started on creating our thumbnails for our design.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.200
So I just have the brush tool selected and also the color black.

00:00:11.370 --> 00:00:18.560
And I'm just going to start drawing rectangular boxes that are about the shape of a screen.

00:00:19.960 --> 00:00:22.400
You're just going to create a couple of these.

00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.330
And what we're going to do is we're going to create our thumbnails inside of these boxes and you want

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:32.280
to keep them pretty small because the idea of a thumbnail is that you just want to get really quick

00:00:32.280 --> 00:00:38.120
ideas out by drawing in these boxes and you don't want it to take a long time.

00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.490
You don't want there to be a lot of detail in them.

00:00:40.580 --> 00:00:47.000
They're just create some simple shapes inside that box that represent what you're trying to convey.

00:00:48.210 --> 00:00:57.060
So for example let's say we wanted to do some mountains and with a house on it we could draw a triangle

00:00:58.830 --> 00:01:07.530
with a house on the side of it and then maybe one to add some trees at the bottom and pine trees.

00:01:07.530 --> 00:01:12.780
What we're doing is we're just trying to we're trying to block out the composition of our piece.

00:01:12.780 --> 00:01:14.300
So let's try another one.

00:01:14.430 --> 00:01:21.300
Let's do a castle on a floating mountains so let's create a mountain.

00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:23.390
Let's make it floating.

00:01:23.550 --> 00:01:29.560
Let's say that this is the ground down here it's just some pine trees.

00:01:29.710 --> 00:01:33.240
Let's add something that looks like a castle on top of this

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:40.740
.

00:01:41.250 --> 00:01:47.690
So there's there's a thumbnail for that one we can have some clouds in there.

00:01:47.730 --> 00:01:53.580
Let's try let's try a lake with an island.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.080
So those are like let's say that's where we want our lake to be and then we can add an island in the

00:01:58.080 --> 00:01:59.210
middle of that.

00:01:59.690 --> 00:02:07.560
And let's put let's put a tree on it.

00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:12.000
So these are just very simple thumbnails so now what we're going to do is we're going to create thumbnails

00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:13.990
for our own backgrounds.

00:02:14.100 --> 00:02:23.310
And so like I said I was thinking we would do some sort of a background of water and some sort of treehouses

00:02:23.330 --> 00:02:24.010
.

00:02:24.070 --> 00:02:25.710
So I'm just going to get started on those.

00:02:25.710 --> 00:02:28.430
And you can just watch and see how I do my thumbnails

00:04:06.890 --> 00:04:53.540
.

00:04:54.130 --> 00:04:54.640
Now.

00:04:54.750 --> 00:04:59.550
These may look really scribbly and not make any sense to you but that's ok because your thumb Del's

00:04:59.580 --> 00:05:02.510
don't have to make sense anybody except for yourself.

00:05:02.520 --> 00:05:06.220
As long as you know what's going on image it's good.

00:05:06.540 --> 00:05:09.020
So let me explain to you what I have going on in mind.

00:05:09.030 --> 00:05:13.540
So in the top one I have these islands and this is our water line right here.

00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:19.140
And I have these islands that you can see the part of the island that's under the water in the part

00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.980
of the island that's above the water and on each island is a treehouse.

00:05:23.130 --> 00:05:24.690
And there's got a bridge going in between them.

00:05:24.690 --> 00:05:30.990
I also did another one where there's two ships floating on the water and they also have some sort of

00:05:30.990 --> 00:05:35.760
a bridge going in between them and some kind of ropes and lines going off to other places.

00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:41.400
The third one is an island where you can see the part of the island that's underwater and the part that's

00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.640
out of the water and on top of the island we have a castle.

00:05:44.670 --> 00:05:50.970
We also have some floating islands off in the background and then on the right side of our thumbnail

00:05:50.970 --> 00:05:56.120
we have some sort of wooden type doc type treehouse building.

00:05:56.120 --> 00:06:01.410
I'm not sure exactly what it would be but that's the idea behind creating thumbnails as you can just

00:06:01.770 --> 00:06:07.260
really quickly block out what you want your image to look like and where you want things to be placed

00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:08.170
.

00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:13.380
Once you've created your thumbnails go out and choose one that you like and will will start to play

00:06:13.380 --> 00:06:16.280
around with it and add more detail to it.

00:06:16.470 --> 00:06:21.180
For me I think I'm going to go with this bottom line I like the direction it's going in so I'm going

00:06:21.180 --> 00:06:25.200
to use this guy an ominous Stribild in my background off of him.
