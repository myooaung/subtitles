00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:06.360
Now we're going to create these little spiders that we have on the top of our first cylinder.

00:00:06.540 --> 00:00:13.650
So what we'll do is we'll come down to our reuse folder and let's turn off our drawings so we can see

00:00:13.650 --> 00:00:14.810
them.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:20.070
We're going to select our smaller cylinder and we're going to copy in

00:00:23.430 --> 00:00:33.390
turn are drawn back on then we'll come up to the top create a new layer above our cylinder paste them

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:38.940
and then we're going to shrink him down

00:00:38.940 --> 00:00:50.280
.

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:54.150
Now what we want to do is we want to create an elliptical

00:00:57.090 --> 00:00:59.260
and using this color.

00:01:01.180 --> 00:01:02.650
We'll fill them and

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:12.360
then we'll move them to the bottom of our cylinder.

00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:22.000
Now we're going to copy our roof for our castle which is right here.

00:01:22.980 --> 00:01:25.050
Our roof has three layers.

00:01:25.050 --> 00:01:30.840
It has the base layer the highlight layer and the bottom layer.

00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:42.750
And we're going to merge those three layers together and then we're going to copy that layer and then

00:01:42.750 --> 00:01:43.890
we will paste them

00:01:47.100 --> 00:01:51.680
right above this little guy right here.

00:01:52.410 --> 00:01:58.400
Actually we want him behind him like that will shrink him down and

00:02:10.290 --> 00:02:13.350
put them into place.

00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:14.690
Awesome.

00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.610
Now what we want to do is we want to merge those two layers

00:02:17.610 --> 00:02:25.990
.

00:02:26.790 --> 00:02:31.230
So now those are one layer and now we can copy

00:02:34.290 --> 00:02:40.080
and paste them and drag them over to our other side.

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:47.880
And what we're also going to do is we are going to change their angle so we're going to go command T

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:53.650
and then we can rotate them just a bit.

00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:59.700
We'll do the same with the other guy.

00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:00.660
Awesome.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:11.070
Now let's drag these behind our large cylinder like so then we'll paste one last one and we will put

00:03:11.070 --> 00:03:12.570
them right in the center.

00:03:12.570 --> 00:03:19.250
And this one we want above our cylinder or in front.

00:03:19.530 --> 00:03:25.700
Now the bottom of our cylinder would not be a light color because behind the castle the light wouldn't

00:03:25.710 --> 00:03:26.220
be hitting it.

00:03:26.220 --> 00:03:33.240
So we want to change that to a darker color and the way we'll do that will come in and using our wand

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.700
selection tool or magic wand.

00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:44.880
We're going to select that area and then we are going to fill it in with a darker color and we are going

00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:50.750
to use this color here.
