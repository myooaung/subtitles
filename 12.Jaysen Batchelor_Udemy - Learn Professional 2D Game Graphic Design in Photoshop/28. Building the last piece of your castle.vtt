00:00:00.530 --> 00:00:04.230
Now let's quickly create the last part to our castle.

00:00:04.230 --> 00:00:10.220
So we're going to create a new folder and we want above our skyline.

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:11.970
We'll call them art six

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:22.090
then we're going to create a new layer in there then using our Lasso tool.

00:00:22.260 --> 00:00:28.200
We're going to trace out the shape what we want to keep it pretty straight.

00:00:28.470 --> 00:00:38.130
Then using that red and that orange we are going to create a gradient

00:00:42.030 --> 00:00:53.360
runway just like so then we want to copy that and paste it and bring him down.

00:00:54.870 --> 00:00:59.130
And we're going to distort him just a little bit

00:01:00.950 --> 00:01:07.910
.

00:01:08.340 --> 00:01:16.920
Then we're going to add a new layer and we want to drag that layer underneath those two roofs.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:26.570
Then using this purple and this blue we're going to we're going to create a gradient.

00:01:26.580 --> 00:01:28.770
But first we need to create our shape

00:01:37.950 --> 00:01:44.150
or shape go ahead and fill that in.

00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:53.490
Then we're going to merge all of those layers and then we're going to warp it to give it a little bit

00:01:53.580 --> 00:01:57.390
of a curve like so

00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:08.890
we'll reposition them.

00:02:09.330 --> 00:02:10.470
Awesome.

00:02:11.010 --> 00:02:18.510
Now we're going to select him and it using this dark purple color are going to fill in on a new layer

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:23.160
above him.

00:02:23.160 --> 00:02:30.560
Then we're going to bring down the opacity to about 25 percent
