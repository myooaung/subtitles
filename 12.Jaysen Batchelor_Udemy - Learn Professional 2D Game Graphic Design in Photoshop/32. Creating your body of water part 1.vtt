00:00:00.210 --> 00:00:06.820
All right guys let's go ahead and create what we've all been waiting for the water.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:14.070
So what we're going to do is we're going to create a new layer or sorry a new folder and then we're

00:00:14.070 --> 00:00:21.270
going to create a new layer within that folder and we're going to select this blue light blue color

00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:30.700
in our sky and we're going to create a straight line just a little bit above our bubble window Let's

00:00:30.860 --> 00:00:38.340
nudge and down just a little though he's not seeping over onto our treaty.

00:00:38.790 --> 00:00:41.090
And then we're going to add a second layer.

00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:48.530
And with our brush tool we are going to make a Wrigley's squiggly line across this straight line.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:53.140
We're going to add a third layer and we'll do that one some more.

00:00:54.030 --> 00:01:01.590
And this time you want to make sure that your squiggly line varies with the first squiggly line.

00:01:01.590 --> 00:01:03.240
Now we can turn off our straight line.

00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:11.140
We can actually delete it and then we're going to merge our two squiggly lines together.

00:01:12.150 --> 00:01:21.810
Then using our wand tool we're going to select this upper area then we're going to invert the selection

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:31.290
then we'll fill this or first we'll create a new layer and drag underneath our first layer then Wolfville

00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:41.190
that layer with gradient of this color and this color

00:01:44.540 --> 00:01:49.650
will go the other way.
