OK real quick I'm going to show you what comes with this course.

00:00:04.620 --> 00:00:09.130
So the first thing that you get with this course is you get the 50 free assets that I promised to you

00:00:09.780 --> 00:00:13.050
and these are just assets that I've created for you for your own use.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:17.730
You can use them in your own projects or you can work and use them in other people's projects such as

00:00:17.730 --> 00:00:18.770
clients.

00:00:19.230 --> 00:00:27.750
And what we have here is we have four folders that are full of different assets and they're split up

00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:34.140
into different sections of the first folder has the shapes here the next folder has these really cool

00:00:34.140 --> 00:00:38.880
looking doors that you can use in different ways and your backgrounds.

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:41.140
Third folder is plants.

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:48.640
And the last folder is Windows or our windows so you can use these assets over and over again.

00:00:48.990 --> 00:00:53.280
And once you go through the course at the very end I'll have a video showing you how to use these assets
