00:00:00.750 --> 00:00:03.150
Let's organize our background now.

00:00:03.450 --> 00:00:05.750
So we have four layers.

00:00:05.940 --> 00:00:13.710
We have our values layer our Skyler our cloud layer and our mountains layer our cloud layer lost its

00:00:13.710 --> 00:00:15.760
name when we merged the two layers.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:22.170
So let's go ahead and rename that first.

00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.990
And now what we want to do is we want to be able to turn off whole sections of our background at once

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:30.640
without having to individually turn them off.

00:00:30.990 --> 00:00:36.420
And so we're going to break our background up into different sections so the first section we'll have

00:00:36.420 --> 00:00:43.810
is the background section which will be our sky our clouds and our mountains.

00:00:43.860 --> 00:00:50.430
So let's go ahead and select all of those by holding down shift but starting with the top one down shift

00:00:50.490 --> 00:00:56.150
and coming down to the bottom where we want to select and it will select all of those.

00:00:56.380 --> 00:01:04.470
And now let's add a folder which is this little icon next to the new layer icon and that will group

00:01:04.470 --> 00:01:06.040
those all into one folders.

00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:07.900
Now you'll see we have one folder there.

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:13.950
If we click on it opens up and we have a whole bunch or we have all of our layers inside that folder

00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:14.220
.

00:01:14.220 --> 00:01:23.930
Now let's name that folder background because this is the background to our background.
