00:00:00.510 --> 00:00:06.600
All right guys let's go ahead and create our next architectural piece for our castle.

00:00:06.600 --> 00:00:10.950
So let's create a new folder and we'll call it R2

00:00:15.930 --> 00:00:23.460
then what we'll do is we are going to come down and grab our large cylinder and we're going to copy

00:00:23.460 --> 00:00:27.750
it and we're going to paste it into our new folder

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:36.090
and then we're going to rotate them and resize them

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:54.810
.

00:00:57.540 --> 00:01:05.130
Now we'll create a new layer underneath him and using our elliptical marquee tool we're going to create

00:01:05.250 --> 00:01:06.120
an oval

00:01:08.910 --> 00:01:12.860
and we're going to fill that oval with this color.

00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:20.040
Then using our brush tool with a soft edge we're going to take this orange

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:30.000
and paint the edges of our oval.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.850
Then we're going to grab this light orange

00:01:36.420 --> 00:01:39.510
and we're going to paint the very edge of our oval

00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:48.900
.

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:56.490
Now we're going to rotate our oval and we might have to shrink them down a little bit

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:03.190
.

00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:11.810
Awesome.

00:02:12.750 --> 00:02:20.720
Now we're going to copy our finial piece and we've left a bit of an oval here or a ring.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:22.950
So we're going to delete that out of our layer

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:28.080
.

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:34.830
Now let's find our finial.

00:02:34.830 --> 00:02:36.800
There he is.

00:02:37.530 --> 00:02:39.610
And we'll copy them.

00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.750
Then we're going to paste them into our new folder.

00:02:48.930 --> 00:02:56.460
And we want to bring him behind our oval piece and we accidentally made our oval piece and our first

00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:56.880
layer.

00:02:56.880 --> 00:03:04.920
So I'm going to drag that up into our new layer then I'll drag my finial piece behind him.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:09.060
And I'm going to rate rotate them and resize them

00:03:09.060 --> 00:03:19.510
.

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:24.120
Now we're going to copy our Raylene layer

00:03:29.370 --> 00:03:32.900
and paste them into our new folder.

00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:42.270
And we want him to be on top of all of our other layers then we'll rotate them and resize them

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.060
.

00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:05.100
And there you are we've just created our second architectural piece to our castle
