Once you've finished creating your trees remember to merge layers together so that each tree has its

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:15.090
own separate layer so we can turn them off and on and select them as one piece.

00:00:15.090 --> 00:00:25.410
So now what we'll do is we're going to use our marquee tool and we're on the last two and we're going

00:00:25.410 --> 00:00:34.300
to select our tree and copy then we're going to come back to our original document.

00:00:35.030 --> 00:00:47.720
And the first floating island folder we're going to pasted on the very bottom After dragging down because

00:00:47.760 --> 00:00:51.860
you can't paste it to the very bottom.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:54.300
Then we will shrink them down

00:01:01.660 --> 00:01:02.910
and we can place them

00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:12.600
like so the guys still might need to come down.

00:01:15.970 --> 00:01:17.040
Awesome.

00:01:17.050 --> 00:01:22.230
And so now we'll just do that with all of the trees and we're going to use some of the trees more than

00:01:22.230 --> 00:01:22.880
once.

00:01:23.100 --> 00:01:25.430
So just go ahead and watch how I place mine.

00:01:25.440 --> 00:01:27.600
And then you can go ahead and do yours

00:01:27.620 --> 00:02:58.200
.

00:04:29.720 --> 00:04:29.860
All

00:04:32.410 --> 00:04:35.790
right.

00:04:35.800 --> 00:04:37.460
I think that looks good.

00:04:37.530 --> 00:04:39.570
So go ahead and place your trees.

00:04:39.570 --> 00:04:44.140
You can place them wherever you like or you can also place them where I've placed my trees.
