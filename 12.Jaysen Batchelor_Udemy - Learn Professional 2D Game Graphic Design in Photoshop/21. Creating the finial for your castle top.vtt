00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.690
Well now create the finial that will be on top of our castle.

00:00:05.820 --> 00:00:19.110
So go ahead and zoom in then create a new layer above our roof then we'll create a circle shape and

00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:21.300
we'll fill that in with this color

00:00:25.800 --> 00:00:27.930
then we're going to grab this purple

00:00:32.700 --> 00:00:38.550
and we're going to paint in the center and we want to make sure we're on a soft brush

00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:48.480
we'll just paint that in like so

00:00:51.510 --> 00:00:54.060
now we're going to grab a white color

00:00:58.080 --> 00:01:05.340
and then we'll just paint a reflection on that point of the finial

00:01:05.340 --> 00:01:12.930
.

00:01:12.930 --> 00:01:21.320
Now let's create a new layer underneath that and using this color.

00:01:23.070 --> 00:01:27.570
We're going to paint a vertical line going straight up.

00:01:27.700 --> 00:01:30.810
But we want to make sure that we are on a hard brush

00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:46.410
then we're going to grab our purple and will shrink our brush size down and we're going to paint in

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.880
the center of that line we just create.

00:01:54.990 --> 00:01:56.760
Now we're going to warp this

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:09.000
so that it comes to a point like so

00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:14.650
great.

00:02:14.670 --> 00:02:17.340
You've just created your finial for your castle
