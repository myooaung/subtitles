00:00:00.240 --> 00:00:06.920
Before we move on to creating our trees Let's go ahead and label these new grass layers.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.580
So we'll just call them grass

00:00:08.580 --> 00:00:17.550
.

00:00:17.640 --> 00:00:18.090
All right.

00:00:18.210 --> 00:00:19.260
Great.

00:00:19.590 --> 00:00:21.550
Now we can create our trees.

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.520
So let's open up our tree sketch.

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:30.510
And what I have here is I have a little test tree that I did and I'm just going to be using this for

00:00:30.510 --> 00:00:31.750
color reference.

00:00:32.130 --> 00:00:33.490
And that's why that's there.

00:00:33.840 --> 00:00:42.480
So let's first add a new layer then using our Lasso tool will trace out the shape of our at least believe

00:00:42.540 --> 00:00:46.050
part of our tree like so

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:10.150
let's fill it in with this orange.

00:01:10.150 --> 00:01:12.150
There's this color right there.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:16.650
And actually we're going to do a gradient.

00:01:16.800 --> 00:01:28.070
So for our bottom color we're going to select this purple there's this color right there.

00:01:29.190 --> 00:01:30.330
We use our gradient tool

00:01:35.650 --> 00:01:39.630
going a different direction.

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:41.040
Great.

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:43.380
Now let's do that for the top part of our tree

00:01:48.510 --> 00:01:58.260
before we move on we want to warp our the shape of our trees are going to go Comanche we have to select

00:01:58.260 --> 00:02:08.650
it so select our shape then command T and then right click to bring up some options and we want to warpage

00:02:08.670 --> 00:02:10.800
so all press work.

00:02:11.170 --> 00:02:17.290
And now we can click and drag certain areas of our image and we can warp it into the shape that we want

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:17.660
.

00:02:17.670 --> 00:02:24.710
What we're trying to achieve is we just want to give a little bit more of a organic curve

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.080
looks going.

00:02:31.470 --> 00:02:33.240
Now we'll move on to the top part of our tree

00:02:33.250 --> 00:02:43.050
.

00:02:52.260 --> 00:02:56.040
We'll fill it in with our gradient

00:03:04.400 --> 00:03:06.280
skin.

00:03:06.330 --> 00:03:13.110
Now we're going to add a highlight to our trees so we're going to select the shapes and then we're going

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.750
to grab it and this yellow color

00:03:17.530 --> 00:03:19.160
there is its color right there.

00:03:19.210 --> 00:03:22.690
I guess it's actually more of an orange.

00:03:23.930 --> 00:03:28.410
And then we're just going to paint the highlight on the top of our leaves

00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:46.560
.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:04.560
All right.

00:04:04.710 --> 00:04:13.200
Looking good now we'll select our shape one more time and then we're going to grab this dark purple

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:14.980
.

00:04:15.180 --> 00:04:22.440
There is this color right there and we're going to add a hard shadow to the bottom of our trees

00:04:23.360 --> 00:04:27.370
.

00:04:27.550 --> 00:04:30.360
Right now let's move on to the trunk.

00:04:31.040 --> 00:04:35.310
So let's add a new layer underneath that.

00:04:35.310 --> 00:04:40.380
And then using our brush tool and this color right here

00:04:47.910 --> 00:04:50.010
we're going to just hand paint the trunks

00:05:31.020 --> 00:05:35.750
it it looks like if we add some extra branches

00:05:49.310 --> 00:05:52.730
I think that actually looks quite nice so I'm going to keep those.

00:05:52.720 --> 00:05:53.000
All right.

00:05:53.000 --> 00:06:01.310
Now the next step is we want to select the shape of our trunk and then using this color we are going

00:06:01.310 --> 00:06:06.210
to add a new layer and fill in our trunk shape.

00:06:06.560 --> 00:06:16.040
Sure you're on the paint bucket will fill that in and then we're going to use our razor and with a soft

00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:25.160
edged razor and we're going to put the opacity down to two and we're going to just erase.

00:06:25.190 --> 00:06:29.750
Start erasing the edges of our branches.

00:06:29.750 --> 00:06:36.220
Now is the leaf part of our tree is going to be casting a big shadow so we're going to completely dark

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:42.440
shade out underneath the leaves.

00:06:46.700 --> 00:06:52.310
And we're just going to continue doing this over and over again until we get a result that we like

00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:07.950
.

00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:24.120
Let's turn our opacity up to four

00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:39.710
.

00:07:55.280 --> 00:07:55.710
All right.

00:07:55.740 --> 00:07:56.580
I think that looks good.

00:07:56.630 --> 00:08:01.350
Let's move on to the next part of a branch and we'll zoom in so we can see better

00:08:22.590 --> 00:08:46.770
.

00:08:49.430 --> 00:08:54.260
Let's turn off our sketch so we can see it all by itself.

00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:56.090
All right.

00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:57.600
I think that looks good.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:09:03.630
We're going to add a little bit more shadow on the trunks so select those shapes again

00:09:06.560 --> 00:09:12.890
and then let's add a new layer and then using a dark blue

00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:20.590
and let's make it d saturated.

00:09:20.590 --> 00:09:25.030
So that's the color I'll be using right there.

00:09:25.110 --> 00:09:31.610
We'll come back to our brush and we're just going to add a shadow underneath there.

00:09:32.730 --> 00:09:33.090
So

00:09:35.690 --> 00:09:38.180
unselect out of that.

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:41.110
But I think that looks good.

00:09:41.480 --> 00:09:46.090
Just go ahead and do that for all the rest of the trees and then we can start placing them
