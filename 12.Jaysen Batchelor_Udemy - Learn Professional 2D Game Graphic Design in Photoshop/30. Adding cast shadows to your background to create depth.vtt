00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:07.880
Now we're going to create a cast shadow that is being caused by this island and this tree.

00:00:07.920 --> 00:00:15.810
So what we'll do is we're going to add a new layer and then we're going to select the shape of our tree

00:00:15.830 --> 00:00:16.300
.

00:00:16.860 --> 00:00:22.860
And on this new layer we're going to fill it in with our dark color blue.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:29.700
Then we are going to reposition them like so

00:00:32.850 --> 00:00:40.260
then we're going to select our castle shape and invert the selection by pressing control shift.

00:00:40.260 --> 00:00:44.110
I then deleting everything outside of that.

00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:50.460
So then that just deleted everything the entire shadow for the tree that is outside of the castle shape

00:00:53.100 --> 00:00:55.510
are going to stay on that same layer.

00:00:55.530 --> 00:00:58.820
But we're going to select our island shape.

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.440
Whoops wrong shape.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:09.200
We're going to select our island shape and we're going to fill that in with our blue.

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:12.060
Then we're going to nudge it up just a bit

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:20.450
like so and we're going to nudge it over just a little bit.

00:01:21.360 --> 00:01:30.780
Then we're going to de-select or sorry then we're going to select the shape of our castle and we're

00:01:30.810 --> 00:01:36.650
going to invert the selection and delete everything outside of that.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:41.420
So now we have our cast shadow from our island and our tree.

00:01:41.790 --> 00:01:46.660
But we want to make sure that it's a little bit blurry and then we'll take down the opacity So let's

00:01:46.660 --> 00:01:49.230
select the shape of our castle.

00:01:49.590 --> 00:01:53.530
Use our filters blur box blur.

00:01:54.890 --> 00:01:58.830
OK then we'll bring that opacity down

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:05.620
about there is good.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:07.370
Awesome.
