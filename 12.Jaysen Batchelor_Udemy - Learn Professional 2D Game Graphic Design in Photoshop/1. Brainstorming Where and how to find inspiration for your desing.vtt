00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:04.170
Now we can start creating our background.

00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:08.170
Now the first thing we're going to do is we're going to brainstorm.

00:00:08.340 --> 00:00:13.850
We need to brainstorm what this background is going to be and what it's going to look like.

00:00:13.890 --> 00:00:20.370
One of my favorite places to come to to get inspiration for my background is or any of my artwork is

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:22.970
Pinterest.

00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:30.630
You can see I've done an image search for game design and it's brought up some really cool looking artwork

00:00:30.650 --> 00:00:30.720
.

00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:37.110
Now we can't use any of this artwork or copy it because this is other artists artwork but we can use

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:42.770
it to get some ideas some style looks and some color schemes.

00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:45.030
We can also do it.

00:00:45.060 --> 00:00:51.480
You can also create your own pinboard and pin things to your board that are only in the style that you're

00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:52.720
looking for.

00:00:53.220 --> 00:01:00.630
So this is my pinboard And as you can see everything is very similar and look and style.

00:01:00.870 --> 00:01:02.400
We can also do an image search.

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:07.730
So right now I've done a search for treehouses on Google.

00:01:07.830 --> 00:01:15.090
I also did one on world travel and you can see it brings up some really cool looking places and can

00:01:15.090 --> 00:01:17.750
really give you some great ideas.

00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:24.930
Now when you're creating a background for an animation or a game there is usually some criteria for

00:01:24.930 --> 00:01:31.080
me I know I want my background for this course to have something to do with water probably an ocean

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:37.440
and I want it to look tropical and I also want there to be some sort of tree house type buildings in

00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:41.880
there and that's why I've done a search on World Travel and cool treehouses.

00:01:41.910 --> 00:01:44.920
I could probably even do an image search on the ocean.

00:01:44.970 --> 00:01:50.550
This might be your first time on creating a background so you might just want to follow along with me

00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:53.020
and not create and design your own background.

00:01:53.190 --> 00:01:58.890
But if you do go ahead and start brainstorming for your own background if not you can just follow along

00:01:58.890 --> 00:02:00.920
with me and copy what I do.

00:02:00.930 --> 00:02:06.630
But hopefully by the end of this course the goal is that you will be able to create your own digital

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:09.800
backgrounds with your own designs.
