00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:04.920
If you've never created art for games or animations.

00:00:04.920 --> 00:00:11.730
One of the best places to come to to find jobs and gain experience are freelancing sites like the one

00:00:11.730 --> 00:00:14.700
we're on right now freelancers dot com.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:21.300
There's a ton of other sites out there such as e Lancer if you do a google search for freelancing sites

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:25.330
it'll give you a ton of them and you can just choose which ever one you want.

00:00:25.350 --> 00:00:30.540
Now I'm going to take you through a walkthrough on freelancer because this is the one that I found the

00:00:30.540 --> 00:00:33.810
best success with in the past.

00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:41.790
So what freelancer is is it's a site for people that have projects that want to get them outsourced

00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:48.630
to other people so they can bring their project to freelancer you the freelancer will bid on their project

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:51.380
along with a bunch of other freelancers.

00:00:51.630 --> 00:00:57.210
Then the employer will take a look at all the bids and they'll look at all the freelancers profiles

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:03.660
their reviews and their portfolios and based off that they're going to choose a freelancer to do the

00:01:03.660 --> 00:01:05.080
job that they have.

00:01:05.130 --> 00:01:07.970
And then once you do the job you'll get paid.

00:01:07.980 --> 00:01:10.560
I'll talk a little bit more about that stuff later.

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:16.890
Now once you've created your account you're going to want to add some details to your profile now.

00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.920
Because I just created this new account and my accounts not linked to anything like my paypal or any

00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:24.140
of my information.

00:01:24.180 --> 00:01:26.270
It won't allow me to fill in my information.

00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:31.800
But when you get in here and you have a real full fledged account it will allow you to fill in all the

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:35.270
information and add all the things to your portfolio.

00:01:35.460 --> 00:01:40.230
So you're going to at Want to add your name down here it'll ask for a description in there you'll just

00:01:40.230 --> 00:01:44.020
put your background and what you do.

00:01:44.250 --> 00:01:47.510
You're also going to want to put in a profile picture.

00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:54.690
Over here you can put in your hourly rate and then down here there is usually a button that will allow

00:01:54.690 --> 00:02:01.740
you to add to your portfolio and you can add files or images and that's the most important part about

00:02:02.070 --> 00:02:08.940
your profile is because when a employer comes to your profile to see who you are and what you do they

00:02:08.940 --> 00:02:15.450
want to see your work and they want to see that you have good reviews up here and those are the two

00:02:15.540 --> 00:02:20.240
most important things on the site are your reviews and your portfolio.

00:02:20.250 --> 00:02:26.210
So when you create your account make sure you try to build up the best portfolio you can.

00:02:26.220 --> 00:02:28.970
And as you create more art you can just keep adding to it.
