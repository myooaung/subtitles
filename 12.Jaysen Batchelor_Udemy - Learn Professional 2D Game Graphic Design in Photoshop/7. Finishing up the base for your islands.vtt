00:00:00.540 --> 00:00:07.170
Now that you've laid out all of your tectonic plates you should have them broken up into individual

00:00:07.170 --> 00:00:16.260
folders so we have our ailin folder our floating island folder number one and our floating island number

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:26.560
to the next step is to fill in all the empty spaces that we have within our islands.

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:32.640
So starting with our island folder it's had a new layer.

00:00:33.330 --> 00:00:37.670
And let's put this layer behind the island.

00:00:37.670 --> 00:00:46.020
Now using our original purple We are going to fill in all the empty spaces

00:01:00.810 --> 00:01:04.590
and now we'll just go ahead and do that for all of our islands

00:01:04.610 --> 00:01:11.310
.

00:01:17.280 --> 00:01:18.820
OK.

00:01:19.050 --> 00:01:22.170
Now we can go ahead and merge both those layers

00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:30.440
and we'll do the same for our island.

00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:41.610
Now now what we'll do is we will hold down control and click our layer and that will select everything

00:01:41.610 --> 00:01:44.730
on that layer.

00:01:44.730 --> 00:01:53.580
Now what we want to do is add a new layer above that using our brush tool with a soft edge.

00:01:53.580 --> 00:02:03.370
We are going to use our purple to fade out our light pink color.

00:02:03.510 --> 00:02:03.930
So

00:02:08.910 --> 00:02:13.680
all right that's good.

00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:17.460
The bottom of our floating islands all have the same shape.

00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:23.050
So we want to fix that by using our Lasso tool.

00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:32.910
It's come to our floating island one and we will just cut out of the bottoms of our tectonic plates

00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:36.810
by deleting them

00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.730
and that will just change the bottom of the tectonic plates a bit

00:02:47.730 --> 00:02:54.880
.

00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:58.860
It's come to our other tectonic plate or other floating island

00:02:58.980 --> 00:03:06.070
.

00:03:13.380 --> 00:03:20.800
Lastly we will add a transparent coat of this pink color over all of our islands.

00:03:21.090 --> 00:03:23.400
So we'll start with our first island.

00:03:24.030 --> 00:03:28.880
And while we're here let's merge these two layers.

00:03:31.650 --> 00:03:39.150
So we'll select our island then we'll add a new layer and using our fill tool.

00:03:39.210 --> 00:03:41.730
We're going to fill it with our original Pink

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:45.940
unselect out of that.

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:52.420
And let's do that for all of our islands.

00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:58.020
Add a new layer above it and then go ahead and fill

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:03.840
it one more time.

00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:06.800
The new layer.

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:08.030
All right.

00:04:08.340 --> 00:04:15.820
Now what we'll do is we're going to bring the opacity down on all of these pink colors.

00:04:16.740 --> 00:04:27.480
So holding down control or command on a Mac select those pink layers and then bring their opacity down

00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:28.390
.

00:04:28.530 --> 00:04:31.590
We're going to bring their opacity down to a bow

00:04:34.420 --> 00:04:38.500
40 percent right about there is good.

00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:43.010
And now we have the base for all of our islands.
