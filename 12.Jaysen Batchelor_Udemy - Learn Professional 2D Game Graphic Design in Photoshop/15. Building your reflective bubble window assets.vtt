00:00:00.300 --> 00:00:07.130
Now we're going to create some bubble windows for our underwater cavern so you can see here.

00:00:07.140 --> 00:00:08.390
I've already created one.

00:00:08.420 --> 00:00:11.310
I'll be using this for color reference.

00:00:11.850 --> 00:00:15.590
So the first thing we want to do is add a new layer.

00:00:15.990 --> 00:00:22.560
Now using the marquee tool and make sure that you're on the elliptical marquee tool we are going to

00:00:22.590 --> 00:00:28.950
create a circle.

00:00:28.950 --> 00:00:37.740
Now we're going to fill that circle and with this color right here there is its color.

00:00:39.690 --> 00:00:41.600
And we'll just fill that in.

00:00:41.610 --> 00:00:46.320
Now let's create a noose layer and keep your selection.

00:00:46.530 --> 00:00:50.890
We're going to fill this circle in with this darker.

00:00:52.450 --> 00:00:58.100
There's its color right there.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.380
Our going to shrink the circle down.

00:01:08.970 --> 00:01:13.390
And now we're going to center it now it should click right into place.

00:01:13.410 --> 00:01:23.580
If it doesn't click into place go up to view snap to and make sure that your guides layers and document

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:27.000
bounds are checked.

00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:38.630
Now what we want to do is create a new layer and then we want to select this dark blue circle.

00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:43.440
Now we'll come back up to our new layer and we're going to fill it in with black

00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:48.960
.

00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:50.700
Now we're going to shrink that down

00:01:56.640 --> 00:01:57.750
and then we'll Centra it

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:05.340
going to shrink it down just a little bit more

00:02:05.340 --> 00:02:12.240
.

00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:21.100
Now let's select our black circle and then coming down to our first two layers we will delete out that

00:02:21.150 --> 00:02:21.840
selection

00:02:25.090 --> 00:02:27.020
.

00:02:27.090 --> 00:02:33.300
Now that we've deleted that out on both layers you'll see if we turn off this black layer we've made

00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.690
a hole.

00:02:35.130 --> 00:02:40.880
Now we can delete our black layer because we don't need it anymore.

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:43.050
Now let's create a new layer.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:45.870
And we want to drag this layer underneath.

00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:47.520
Our first two layers

00:02:50.460 --> 00:02:54.960
using the gradient tool we are going to create a gradient between this color

00:02:58.260 --> 00:03:02.680
and this color and there is that colors number

00:03:06.360 --> 00:03:11.560
and there is that colors number.

00:03:11.580 --> 00:03:18.620
Let's go ahead and fill that gradient in.

00:03:18.750 --> 00:03:25.320
Now let's resize the circle to make it just a bit larger

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.040
than the whole.

00:03:31.050 --> 00:03:32.510
Then let's really center it

00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:46.620
now will select our dark green and then we're going to create a layer a new layer above our bottom layer

00:03:46.620 --> 00:03:47.750
.

00:03:47.850 --> 00:03:51.560
We're going to fill this ring with the color black.

00:03:51.570 --> 00:03:54.060
Actually let's make it a very dark blue

00:03:54.060 --> 00:04:00.900
.

00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:07.800
Now make sure you are unselected out of that and it will go up to filters and then Blur and we'll use

00:04:07.800 --> 00:04:10.990
our boxy blur again.

00:04:11.010 --> 00:04:15.660
And let's put it at 10.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:17.200
Now we want to do this one.

00:04:17.250 --> 00:04:18.200
One more time.

00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:19.930
But with the color white.

00:04:19.980 --> 00:04:28.560
So we'll select our dark ring out a new layer above our last black layer.

00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:30.390
We'll fill that with white

00:04:34.470 --> 00:04:45.590
select out of it go up to filter's blur box color and we'll put that at 10 also.

00:04:46.260 --> 00:04:53.760
Now using our grab and move tool we're going to nudge that over just a bit.

00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:59.340
We want it nudged over enough that we can still see our dark.

00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.680
And we want our right right next to it.

00:05:03.810 --> 00:05:07.990
Now using our erase tool we want it quite large

00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:21.360
and let's make sure we're on a soft brush and let's bring the opacity down to two are going to erase

00:05:21.450 --> 00:05:24.240
this edge side of our circle

00:05:24.260 --> 00:05:31.160
.

00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:44.200
Now let's bring the opacity down on that.

00:05:45.510 --> 00:05:46.730
There is good.

00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:53.950
And now the last thing we need to do is we need to create our reflection in the glass.

00:05:54.270 --> 00:06:02.370
So at the very top of our layers we're going to add a new layer then using our rectangular marquee tool

00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:14.100
are going to create a rectangle and we'll fill that in with white.

00:06:14.100 --> 00:06:16.190
Now we'll want to warp that.

00:06:16.260 --> 00:06:25.530
So using command t right clicking and go into warp we will warp that shape to have a curve that will

00:06:25.530 --> 00:06:27.390
curve with the bubble window

00:06:32.570 --> 00:06:37.910
.

00:06:39.880 --> 00:06:49.370
It's moved down just a bit then using our eraser tool with a soft edge.

00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:55.830
We are going to make sure that it's its opacity is up to zero.

00:06:55.890 --> 00:06:58.930
Are you going to erase the corner of that out.

00:06:59.180 --> 00:07:06.000
Now we're going to bring down the size of our brush a lot and we'll take that corner out and we're going

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.360
to create a line right through there.

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:14.130
And there you have it you've just created a bubble window.

00:07:14.130 --> 00:07:21.780
Now the next step is to cut out our bubble window and place it into our original background document
