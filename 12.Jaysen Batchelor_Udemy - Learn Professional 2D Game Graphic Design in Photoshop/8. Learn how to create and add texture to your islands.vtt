00:00:00.780 --> 00:00:10.500
Let's go ahead and create some texture for our islands created a new document that's 1920 by 10.

00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:16.500
Let's add a new layer to it and make sure that we have the color black selected.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:23.660
Now using our brush tool we're going to create some texture for our islands.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:31.170
So make sure we're on a hard edge brush and let's make sure that the brush is all the way up to 1000

00:00:31.170 --> 00:00:33.050
percent.

00:00:33.060 --> 00:00:37.030
Now we want our brush size to be pretty small.

00:00:38.010 --> 00:00:46.770
Now what we'll do is we're just going to do some random squiggles on our canvas and we want to do this

00:00:46.830 --> 00:00:48.750
with a couple of different brush sizes

00:00:48.750 --> 00:01:00.390
.

00:01:00.390 --> 00:01:09.660
Now the smaller our brush gets closer the spacing becomes so when we get really small we want to manually

00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:13.860
place our spots on our page

00:01:23.580 --> 00:01:25.470
and we'll do a couple of big ones

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:30.420
too big

00:01:35.350 --> 00:01:40.690
.

00:01:40.920 --> 00:01:42.530
That's good.

00:01:42.540 --> 00:01:53.060
Now let's copy this layer and then we're going to paste them back into our background document.

00:01:53.100 --> 00:02:01.570
Now let's shrink this Slayer down so it fits over our island.

00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:01.980
So

00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:17.850
now let's move this layer into our island folder open him up and now we're going to select this layer

00:02:18.210 --> 00:02:27.810
and everything in it and then add a new layer and this new layer we're going to fill it with the color

00:02:27.820 --> 00:02:32.870
white using our fill tool.

00:02:32.910 --> 00:02:37.260
Now let's grab that layer and bring it beneath our original layer

00:02:40.020 --> 00:02:46.350
and then unselect out of that then using our Graben moved to old.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:56.610
We're going to use the arrows on our keyboard to nudge that layer down just a bit like this just enough

00:02:56.610 --> 00:02:59.830
so a little bit of that wire showing.

00:03:00.900 --> 00:03:03.050
Now we can merge those two layers together

00:03:07.170 --> 00:03:13.950
then select one of the two layers that have the shape of your island.

00:03:15.250 --> 00:03:23.940
Then come back to your spotted layer and press control shift on your keyboard and that will invert the

00:03:23.940 --> 00:03:34.440
selection then hit delete and it will delete all of the spots outside of your island.

00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:41.430
Now let's change our island layer to overlay then let's bring the opacity down

00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:49.980
25 percent should about do it.

00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:56.390
And now we have some nice texture for our island.

00:03:56.490 --> 00:04:01.520
Go ahead and do that on both the other islands and we can move on with the course
