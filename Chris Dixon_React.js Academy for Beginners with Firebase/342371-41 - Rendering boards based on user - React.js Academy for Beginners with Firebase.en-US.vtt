00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:02.970
Inside of this board's view,

00:00:02.970 --> 00:00:05.040
we're currently logged in as this user,

00:00:05.040 --> 00:00:06.840
which ends in n1.

00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:08.760
Of any Firebase console,

00:00:08.760 --> 00:00:10.605
if you take a look at the boards collection,

00:00:10.605 --> 00:00:12.315
micron logged in user,

00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:15.600
which ends in n1, has created this board.

00:00:15.600 --> 00:00:17.340
If you go down to the second one,

00:00:17.340 --> 00:00:23.475
this is created by abc123 as is the third and fourth board too.

00:00:23.475 --> 00:00:25.370
Inside of our application,

00:00:25.370 --> 00:00:29.900
we only should see the board which the current logged in user has created.

00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.560
This of course, caused a problem because a user should only see

00:00:33.560 --> 00:00:37.990
the boards which they have created rather than other people's too.

00:00:37.990 --> 00:00:43.895
This home route already has this user ID passed in as a URL parameter.

00:00:43.895 --> 00:00:47.740
Over in the home.js components,

00:00:47.740 --> 00:00:50.400
let's open this up in the sidebar,

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:54.640
we can pass in this parameter when we call the get board method.

00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:57.095
Inside of component did mount,

00:00:57.095 --> 00:01:01.550
we can access this dot props dot match,

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:07.850
dot params, and then the user ID over in the app.js.

00:01:07.850 --> 00:01:10.445
If we save this file, head out to the app,

00:01:10.445 --> 00:01:12.350
this method is always inside of

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:16.325
this components where we can receive these props as an argument.

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:20.675
So let's take a look for the method which we call get boards,

00:01:20.675 --> 00:01:22.440
which is just here.

00:01:22.440 --> 00:01:25.700
We already have this User ID which we added in earlier,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:27.920
but our present, it's not been used.

00:01:27.920 --> 00:01:30.500
The first thing to do after the board's ref,

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:32.825
is to remove the get method.

00:01:32.825 --> 00:01:34.430
Then in place of this,

00:01:34.430 --> 00:01:37.595
what I'm going to use the where method which we've looked at earlier,

00:01:37.595 --> 00:01:39.920
which will allow us to only get the boards where

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.095
the board user field matches the current user ID.

00:01:44.095 --> 00:01:49.845
As the first parameter, this is the board field name which is board.User,

00:01:49.845 --> 00:01:51.795
separated by a comma.

00:01:51.795 --> 00:01:53.885
This is the comparison operator,

00:01:53.885 --> 00:01:56.440
which is equals the third one.

00:01:56.440 --> 00:01:58.865
We want to check this against the user ID,

00:01:58.865 --> 00:02:01.780
which is being passed in from the parameters.

00:02:01.780 --> 00:02:05.060
So we can add this variable inside here.

00:02:05.060 --> 00:02:08.810
Then we can also chain on the end the order by method,

00:02:08.810 --> 00:02:13.270
which is going to return the boards in order of when they were created.

00:02:13.270 --> 00:02:17.100
We can do this by accessing the board.created@field.

00:02:17.980 --> 00:02:21.740
Then finally we can call get to pull in all of

00:02:21.740 --> 00:02:27.960
our board data over to the browser and now we don't see any boards inside of here,

00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:32.675
but if we right-click and inspect and then go into the console,

00:02:32.675 --> 00:02:36.080
we now see the message of the query requires an index.

00:02:36.080 --> 00:02:40.145
Just like earlier this is because we're now using a more complex query.

00:02:40.145 --> 00:02:43.690
So we can now click on this link to create this in Firebase,

00:02:43.690 --> 00:02:45.110
and then like we did previously,

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:50.550
we can go ahead and create our index and then it gives a few moments to create.

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:55.985
Once this is done, we're now going to go over to the database.

00:02:55.985 --> 00:03:00.320
So click on the Data tab and then we're going to remove all of these boards.

00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:03.575
I also have a spelling mistake here where this should be created at.

00:03:03.575 --> 00:03:06.425
So it also fixes in just a moment too.

00:03:06.425 --> 00:03:08.935
Let's leave the collection,

00:03:08.935 --> 00:03:11.025
type in the name of boards,

00:03:11.025 --> 00:03:17.010
since some are easily created by a hard-coded user of abc123.

00:03:17.010 --> 00:03:23.100
Now let's go to the create board form and in the board object just here,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:25.395
we can now created at just here.

00:03:25.395 --> 00:03:30.110
Service files and now the new boards will now have the correct data.

00:03:30.110 --> 00:03:32.315
Inside app.js.

00:03:32.315 --> 00:03:34.580
We have everything we now need in here.

00:03:34.580 --> 00:03:36.845
So let's go over to the projects,

00:03:36.845 --> 00:03:38.525
let's create a new board.

00:03:38.525 --> 00:03:42.765
Let's call this the course ideas and it's going to be blue,

00:03:42.765 --> 00:03:45.450
create on your board and this appears good.

00:03:45.450 --> 00:03:47.760
Let's say todo for the next one.

00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:49.775
Choose a different color.

00:03:49.775 --> 00:03:53.120
So these are created for our current logged in user.

00:03:53.120 --> 00:03:54.815
Let's try logging out.

00:03:54.815 --> 00:03:58.490
We don't have any redirect or error messages setup just yet,

00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.165
but we will handle this in the next video.

00:04:01.165 --> 00:04:04.550
Now let's go ahead and sign in with a separate user

00:04:04.550 --> 00:04:08.335
so we can check these boards and not displaying for a different account.

00:04:08.335 --> 00:04:12.150
Add the email and password and then login.

00:04:12.150 --> 00:04:15.575
We also need to grab the ID for the second user.

00:04:15.575 --> 00:04:20.229
So from authentication, let's grab the user ID,

00:04:20.229 --> 00:04:22.845
now we can go over to our project.

00:04:22.845 --> 00:04:26.130
Forward slash paste this in and then forward slash

00:04:26.130 --> 00:04:30.920
boards and now we don't see the boards created from our previous user,

00:04:30.920 --> 00:04:34.340
since these are filtered down by our user ID.

00:04:34.340 --> 00:04:37.370
Let's try creating a new board for this one.

00:04:37.370 --> 00:04:41.985
So test in create a new board, good.

00:04:41.985 --> 00:04:46.610
Now, any new boards which we add will only show off for the user who created them.

00:04:46.610 --> 00:04:51.595
Later in this section, we will also introduce some security rules on the server,

00:04:51.595 --> 00:04:53.425
to help prevent this two.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:55.370
Next though, we will improve on

00:04:55.370 --> 00:05:01.560
the user's sign-up and login experience by providing redirects and error messages.
