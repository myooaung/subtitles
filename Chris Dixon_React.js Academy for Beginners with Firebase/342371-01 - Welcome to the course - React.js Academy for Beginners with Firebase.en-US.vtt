00:00:04.310 --> 00:00:08.145
Welcome to the React Academy for beginners.

00:00:08.145 --> 00:00:12.210
In this course, you will learn everything you need to know to get going with react,

00:00:12.210 --> 00:00:14.355
to build user interfaces.

00:00:14.355 --> 00:00:16.470
All our builds in a real project,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:18.780
put your new skills into practice.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:23.175
Throughout this course, you will be building eight fellow inspired application,

00:00:23.175 --> 00:00:26.415
which really shows you what you can do with react.

00:00:26.415 --> 00:00:32.595
We build falls to group together your ideas and organize them with lists and cards,

00:00:32.595 --> 00:00:35.790
all while making news of react components.

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.515
These are also editable,

00:00:37.515 --> 00:00:41.465
you can click on them to change the names and also the cars have

00:00:41.465 --> 00:00:47.785
a pop-up model where we can change the contents and also add or remove any labels.

00:00:47.785 --> 00:00:50.750
This app gives us the chance to understand react

00:00:50.750 --> 00:00:54.440
concepts such as passing data with props,

00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.115
working with state, forms, routing,

00:00:58.115 --> 00:01:00.580
component types, and life cycles,

00:01:00.580 --> 00:01:03.020
custom methods, and so much more.

00:01:03.020 --> 00:01:05.044
This course is beginner friendly,

00:01:05.044 --> 00:01:06.980
so if you are new to react,

00:01:06.980 --> 00:01:10.070
we'll go over all the basics you need to get started,

00:01:10.070 --> 00:01:12.740
and then step things up throughout the course to give

00:01:12.740 --> 00:01:15.380
you a deeper understanding of react.

00:01:15.380 --> 00:01:19.850
Although we should already have a familiarity with HTML, CSS,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.990
and basic JavaScript to get the most out of this course,

00:01:23.990 --> 00:01:27.970
we will not just be building the front-end of the application either.

00:01:27.970 --> 00:01:33.065
We'll also make use of Firebase to create a back-end for our project too.

00:01:33.065 --> 00:01:37.190
This will give us a real-time database to store all of our data.

00:01:37.190 --> 00:01:43.340
It will persist after a user returns and also any changes we make,

00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:46.190
such as add-in, removing or update in.

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.205
We'll update our application in real time,

00:01:49.205 --> 00:01:54.810
meaning changes will take effect right away without needing to reload the page.

00:01:54.810 --> 00:01:58.720
We also enable users to sign up and login to our graph.

00:01:58.720 --> 00:02:02.000
This allows users to have their own personal boards,

00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.910
which only they can see or edit.

00:02:04.910 --> 00:02:10.205
Along with learning about things such as conditional rendering, documents, snapshots,

00:02:10.205 --> 00:02:13.565
authentication, salting, and filtering,

00:02:13.565 --> 00:02:18.560
listening for changes, and also the React contacts API.

00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:22.250
We round off the course by learning how to build your app for

00:02:22.250 --> 00:02:25.445
production and finally deploy for the rest of the world

00:02:25.445 --> 00:02:28.430
to see so if you were interested in learning

00:02:28.430 --> 00:02:32.105
React and want to build a foreigner project along the way,

00:02:32.105 --> 00:02:36.090
enroll in the course, and I will see you in the class.
