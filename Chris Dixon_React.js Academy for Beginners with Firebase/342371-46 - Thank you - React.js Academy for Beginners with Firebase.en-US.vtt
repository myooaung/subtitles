00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:04.050
Congratulations, you've reached the end of this class.

00:00:04.050 --> 00:00:08.130
Thank you for enrolling and I hope you've had fun learning all about what

00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:12.780
React is and how we can use it to build applications using JavaScript.

00:00:12.780 --> 00:00:14.580
While building our app,

00:00:14.580 --> 00:00:16.470
we have clicked quite a lot of ground,

00:00:16.470 --> 00:00:17.940
starting at the beginning,

00:00:17.940 --> 00:00:22.905
where we looked at the basics such as setting of our app, components,

00:00:22.905 --> 00:00:25.635
life cycles, methods and prompts,

00:00:25.635 --> 00:00:28.770
working with state and prompt validation.

00:00:28.770 --> 00:00:31.710
We moved on to using forms and inputs,

00:00:31.710 --> 00:00:38.105
and how React uses both controlled and uncontrolled components for different situations.

00:00:38.105 --> 00:00:42.225
Our users also need a way to navigate through our pages.

00:00:42.225 --> 00:00:46.100
We then moved on to solving this using a front-end routing.

00:00:46.100 --> 00:00:48.965
Along with other solutions the router provided,

00:00:48.965 --> 00:00:51.380
such as router prompts and state,

00:00:51.380 --> 00:00:54.725
push methods and URL parameters.

00:00:54.725 --> 00:00:58.205
React only covers the front end of our project though,

00:00:58.205 --> 00:01:01.310
so we often need a back end service, too.

00:01:01.310 --> 00:01:03.440
At least, we hooked up Firebase to give us

00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:08.000
a real-time database to start all boards, lists and cards.

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.200
Along with learning all about creating, reading, updating,

00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:19.595
and deleting data, along with various Firebase methods and user authentication services.

00:01:19.595 --> 00:01:24.980
Finally, we built our app for production and deployed for the rest of the world to see.

00:01:24.980 --> 00:01:27.500
I hope you've enjoyed this course,

00:01:27.500 --> 00:01:32.160
and I look forward to seeing you again in a future class.
