00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.585
Once we're happy with our application,

00:00:03.585 --> 00:00:06.270
it's time to create a build for production.

00:00:06.270 --> 00:00:10.740
Let's begin by going over to the package.json in the sidebar.

00:00:10.740 --> 00:00:16.050
Open this up. If we scroll down to the script section which we have just here.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:20.700
We've been so far using the startup script for development and there

00:00:20.700 --> 00:00:25.805
is also a build script which we'll have just below to build our app for production.

00:00:25.805 --> 00:00:28.630
So let's do this inside of the terminal.

00:00:28.630 --> 00:00:32.335
I'm going to open up a new tab inside the terminal.

00:00:32.335 --> 00:00:35.385
Once we are on this, we can run npm,

00:00:35.385 --> 00:00:38.595
run build, and then set this off.

00:00:38.595 --> 00:00:41.030
Give us a few moments to go ahead and build for

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:45.265
production and I'll see you in a moment when this is all done.

00:00:45.265 --> 00:00:48.980
Once this is done, if we now open up the sidebar,

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:52.660
you'll notice inside of our project we now have a build folder.

00:00:52.660 --> 00:00:56.270
This contains what we need to deploy our app for production.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.235
It strips away anything we don't need,

00:00:58.235 --> 00:00:59.645
such as any development,

00:00:59.645 --> 00:01:01.835
error messages and dependencies.

00:01:01.835 --> 00:01:07.420
We've built our application using lots of JavaScript files for pages and components.

00:01:07.420 --> 00:01:11.250
Inside of this Build folder it will be bundled together.

00:01:11.250 --> 00:01:14.945
So we don't have to make a separate request for each file.

00:01:14.945 --> 00:01:19.090
It will also do the same if we have multiple CSS files too.

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:22.910
We can see this if you open up the static file inside here,

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.845
we have a CSS and also a JavaScript folder,

00:01:26.845 --> 00:01:30.455
and it's inside here where our files are bundled together.

00:01:30.455 --> 00:01:33.574
Inside here for our JavaScript bond, for example,

00:01:33.574 --> 00:01:36.530
there is quite a few bundles which are split up and

00:01:36.530 --> 00:01:39.790
have numbers in the filenames for cashing purposes.

00:01:39.790 --> 00:01:42.890
The filename that we'd made inside of it,

00:01:42.890 --> 00:01:44.870
which is this one just here,

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:47.515
is our application code which we wrote.

00:01:47.515 --> 00:01:51.995
If we open this up you may see certain parts of our application which we recognize.

00:01:51.995 --> 00:01:56.435
So for example, if we add in here set states,

00:01:56.435 --> 00:02:00.700
we have our set state call where we set the selected Labels.

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:03.200
If we keep going through our code,

00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:05.675
we have one for opened up the modal.

00:02:05.675 --> 00:02:07.820
So we'll see references to our code,

00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:11.215
but this is compressed and formatted for production.

00:02:11.215 --> 00:02:15.380
Inside the sidebar, we also have files beginning with a number,

00:02:15.380 --> 00:02:20.240
such as these ones just here and this is often a third party vendor code,

00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:26.930
such as any node modules we've included and these are cached separately for performance.

00:02:26.930 --> 00:02:30.680
Then the runtime filenames which will have down at the bottom.

00:02:30.680 --> 00:02:34.700
These are some web pack code to load and run our application.

00:02:34.700 --> 00:02:37.955
We still have our main index.html file,

00:02:37.955 --> 00:02:42.175
which is now pointing to our main JavaScript file inside of the build.

00:02:42.175 --> 00:02:44.595
Let's go across to our scripts.

00:02:44.595 --> 00:02:47.285
This is now pointing to our JavaScript file,

00:02:47.285 --> 00:02:52.625
which is inside of our bundle and this is the main file which we looked up before.

00:02:52.625 --> 00:02:56.255
So now we have this build folder inside of our application.

00:02:56.255 --> 00:03:01.470
We are now ready to move on to the next video and deploy our app to production.
