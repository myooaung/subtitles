00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.740
To get-go, there is only a few things which you will need and the fact that

00:00:04.740 --> 00:00:09.240
you are taking a tech course probably means you already have some of these anyway.

00:00:09.240 --> 00:00:11.190
First of all, I will be using Chrome as

00:00:11.190 --> 00:00:15.360
my web browser but you are free to use any which you prefer.

00:00:15.360 --> 00:00:18.800
However, I would recommend either Chrome or Firefox,

00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:21.005
since the React developer tools,

00:00:21.005 --> 00:00:26.045
which we'll be using is only currently available for these two browsers.

00:00:26.045 --> 00:00:27.630
To get the developer tools,

00:00:27.630 --> 00:00:31.445
do a search for reactive tools and as you can see here,

00:00:31.445 --> 00:00:35.060
we have the options for add into Chrome or also

00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:39.680
to add to Firefox which you can find from this link here.

00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:44.495
I recommend you go ahead and download these for either Chrome or Firefox,

00:00:44.495 --> 00:00:47.405
and it will really help throughout this course.

00:00:47.405 --> 00:00:50.645
Next, we have the node JS download,

00:00:50.645 --> 00:00:54.280
which is available from nodejs.org.

00:00:54.280 --> 00:00:58.460
We won't be using node as a back-end or a Web server,

00:00:58.460 --> 00:01:03.730
but it is needed for a lot of the tool in which we use when developing locally.

00:01:03.730 --> 00:01:07.040
Go ahead and download the latest chrome conversion for

00:01:07.040 --> 00:01:11.410
your operating system and then click "Next" through the installation.

00:01:11.410 --> 00:01:13.780
We also need a text editor tool,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.355
and I'll be using Visual Studio Code,

00:01:16.355 --> 00:01:20.480
which you can download from code.VisualStudio.com.

00:01:20.480 --> 00:01:22.815
You can use others if you prefer.

00:01:22.815 --> 00:01:27.335
But this is one which I really like and I will be using throughout the course.

00:01:27.335 --> 00:01:29.944
It also has a built-in terminal,

00:01:29.944 --> 00:01:34.930
which works well and we'll take advantage of this when building our projects.

00:01:34.930 --> 00:01:40.505
Again, any terminal is also fine to use if you want to use something different.

00:01:40.505 --> 00:01:44.455
But for this course, I'll be using the one built in to the s-code.

00:01:44.455 --> 00:01:47.195
If you would like to use this, I recommend you go ahead

00:01:47.195 --> 00:01:49.730
and download for your machine and then go through

00:01:49.730 --> 00:01:51.680
the usual installation process for

00:01:51.680 --> 00:01:55.760
your computer and then this is pretty much all we need to get going.

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:00.080
Anything else we need to use such as any packages from MPM,

00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.800
we will download as we go through the course.

00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:07.980
Let's now move on to learning all about React in the next section.
