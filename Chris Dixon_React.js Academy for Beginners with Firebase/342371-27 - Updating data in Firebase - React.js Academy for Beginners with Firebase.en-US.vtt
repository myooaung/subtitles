00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:07.065
In this section we're going to be focusing on updating our boards, lists and cards.

00:00:07.065 --> 00:00:10.050
This is important since a user may want to obey

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:14.160
things such as a board title or a label on a card.

00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:17.400
Those labels are something which we'll get into Zoom.

00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:20.490
In this video, we're going to be making the board and lists

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:23.895
titles both editable after we click on them.

00:00:23.895 --> 00:00:27.705
Then we can make any changes and push them to Firebase.

00:00:27.705 --> 00:00:33.495
Lets start over in the board.js then we can work with our board title.

00:00:33.495 --> 00:00:37.800
Here we're going to be replacing the current board title with

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:42.200
HTML input element so the user can then type into it.

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:46.525
Let's begin by removing our level three heading so let's remove,

00:00:46.525 --> 00:00:48.980
or comment out this line both.

00:00:48.980 --> 00:00:53.080
Then inside here we can create a HTML input.

00:00:54.650 --> 00:01:01.175
Then on the next line I'm going to add the type which is going to be equal to text.

00:01:01.175 --> 00:01:08.875
Also, a name, which is going to be the board title on change,

00:01:08.875 --> 00:01:12.905
which will trigger a method which is going to be called update board.

00:01:12.905 --> 00:01:19.090
The last attribute is going to be the default value and the default value is

00:01:19.090 --> 00:01:25.760
going to be equal to this.state.currentBoard.title.

00:01:27.130 --> 00:01:32.615
This is going to grab the title just like it did above in our level three heading.

00:01:32.615 --> 00:01:37.115
Using the default value rather than just the value attribute,

00:01:37.115 --> 00:01:39.245
we'll specify the initial value.

00:01:39.245 --> 00:01:44.905
We'll then leave subsequent updates on controlled so we can therefore edit this field.

00:01:44.905 --> 00:01:50.485
I'll save this file and then go over to the browser, into our projects.

00:01:50.485 --> 00:01:53.925
We need to go back, select the board.

00:01:53.925 --> 00:01:56.910
We can now click on its title and edit it.

00:01:56.910 --> 00:02:01.370
Of course, this won't be saved to Firebase at the moment because we haven't

00:02:01.370 --> 00:02:06.295
created this update board method which we call an inside here.

00:02:06.295 --> 00:02:10.065
Let's do this outside of the render method.

00:02:10.065 --> 00:02:13.420
We can create update board,

00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:19.250
passing the event information and then sets about function.

00:02:19.250 --> 00:02:26.210
This actual board update will open the app.js along with all of the overboard auctions.

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:32.165
Let's begin a bigamy in the board Id and store it inside of a constant.

00:02:32.165 --> 00:02:42.145
The board Id is available from this.props.match.params.boardId.

00:02:42.145 --> 00:02:46.685
This is a board Id which is available from the URL parameters.

00:02:46.685 --> 00:02:49.630
We store it inside of this variable.

00:02:49.630 --> 00:02:54.650
Let's now create a new constant which is going to be called new title.

00:02:54.650 --> 00:02:58.250
This is going to store the value which the user typed in.

00:02:58.250 --> 00:03:03.190
We can grab this from e.currentTarget.value.

00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:09.260
Next, open grades and if statements where we can check if the board Id is

00:03:09.260 --> 00:03:14.374
present and we also want to check if there is a new title.

00:03:14.374 --> 00:03:16.280
If both of these are present,

00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.370
we want to call a method called update board,

00:03:19.370 --> 00:03:22.960
which we're going to create an app.js in just a moment.

00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:30.520
This will pass down as props so we can access with this.props.updateBoard.

00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:32.615
Then we're going to send to this method,

00:03:32.615 --> 00:03:39.004
the board Id and also the new text which is saved in new title.

00:03:39.004 --> 00:03:44.405
Let's now go up to the app.js and we can create this update board method,

00:03:44.405 --> 00:03:48.590
which is going to be responsible for saving this to Firebase.

00:03:48.590 --> 00:03:51.270
So outside of the render,

00:03:51.470 --> 00:03:56.985
update board is will be asynchronous.

00:03:56.985 --> 00:04:03.040
We'll say again the board Id and also the new title.

00:04:04.790 --> 00:04:11.430
We can settle back trying section then the catch just afterwards.

00:04:11.430 --> 00:04:15.540
Passing in the error where we can

00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:20.040
do a console error with the text of error updating board,

00:04:21.980 --> 00:04:24.930
also passing in the error.

00:04:24.930 --> 00:04:31.285
Good. Now, the first thing to do is to grab the board from Firebase using this board Id.

00:04:31.285 --> 00:04:34.990
Install the semi constants called board.

00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:38.220
We have our boards ref,

00:04:38.220 --> 00:04:40.040
which points to our collection.

00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:43.070
We want to target a specific document

00:04:43.070 --> 00:04:47.120
and this document is going to be equal to the board Id.

00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:52.470
The next thing we can do is call a Firebase method called update.

00:04:53.720 --> 00:04:57.485
Then inside here we're going to pass in an object.

00:04:57.485 --> 00:05:04.115
The field which we want to update is a title and this is available with board.title.

00:05:04.115 --> 00:05:08.670
I'm going to set this to the new title which is passed in.

00:05:09.170 --> 00:05:14.555
Now we've created this. We also now need to pass this down to the board components.

00:05:14.555 --> 00:05:17.885
Since we call niche from the board.js,

00:05:17.885 --> 00:05:20.350
let's pass this in as props.

00:05:20.350 --> 00:05:29.040
This is update board so they still update board over to the boards.js.

00:05:29.040 --> 00:05:32.880
You can also add this to of prop types down at the very bottom.

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:35.860
This is update board.

00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:43.640
The prop types, this is also a function which is also required

00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:48.605
to save this file now over to the browser.

00:05:48.605 --> 00:05:51.920
Let's shrink this down. I don't want to put this side-by-side with

00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.305
the Firebase console so we can see this updating in real time.

00:05:56.305 --> 00:06:02.610
The console, let's select our to-do board which is this one just here.

00:06:02.610 --> 00:06:04.125
Click on our title.

00:06:04.125 --> 00:06:06.455
Let's try to add some different texts into here.

00:06:06.455 --> 00:06:09.040
I'm going to see this updates immediately.

00:06:09.040 --> 00:06:10.935
We can remove this.

00:06:10.935 --> 00:06:12.645
Let's try to refresh.

00:06:12.645 --> 00:06:14.210
If we now reload the browser,

00:06:14.210 --> 00:06:17.485
we see this data will persist after a reload.

00:06:17.485 --> 00:06:21.035
Changing the list title is also very similar to,

00:06:21.035 --> 00:06:24.620
if not even simpler since I'm going to be adding all of the code

00:06:24.620 --> 00:06:28.990
into list component so there is no need to pass it down props.

00:06:28.990 --> 00:06:32.050
If we go over to the list.js,

00:06:32.050 --> 00:06:35.980
we can replace our p elements with an input.

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:38.435
Scroll down to the render.

00:06:38.435 --> 00:06:40.685
Rather than our p elements,

00:06:40.685 --> 00:06:46.810
we can remove this and HTML inputs.

00:06:47.170 --> 00:06:51.360
The type is going to be equal to text.

00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:57.390
We're going to also add a name which is going to be the list title.

00:06:58.130 --> 00:07:02.800
On change this will trigger a new method which is going to be

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:10.140
update list then finally the default value.

00:07:10.140 --> 00:07:16.630
This default value is going to be equal to this.props.list.title so we going to

00:07:16.630 --> 00:07:23.270
grab this from above then we can construct the update list outside of the render method.

00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:31.480
This will be a sync taking in the event information.

00:07:31.760 --> 00:07:40.790
First of all, as ever, we add our try section and I will catch for any error handling.

00:07:41.450 --> 00:07:45.840
The console error is going to be a string of

00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:54.675
error updating list also passing in the error just afterwards.

00:07:54.675 --> 00:07:57.890
Update list also needs access to this list

00:07:57.890 --> 00:08:01.430
Id so let's crop this constant from just above.

00:08:01.430 --> 00:08:03.700
We can then add this in.

00:08:03.700 --> 00:08:09.180
A second constant of new title which is going to store in the value,

00:08:09.180 --> 00:08:11.100
which the user has typed in.

00:08:11.100 --> 00:08:18.575
We can grab this from e.currentTarget then grab the value which the user has entered.

00:08:18.575 --> 00:08:23.860
Next, we grab our list from Firebase and store it into a constant called list.

00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.070
Let's await the lists ref.

00:08:27.590 --> 00:08:31.125
We can grab a document by the ID,

00:08:31.125 --> 00:08:34.830
and the Id is stored just both in list Id.

00:08:34.830 --> 00:08:40.715
The final step is to call the update method with list.update.

00:08:40.715 --> 00:08:42.850
Inside here as an object,

00:08:42.850 --> 00:08:46.645
we're going to update the title field which we can grab from

00:08:46.645 --> 00:08:52.270
list.title and set this equal to our new title.

00:08:52.550 --> 00:08:55.690
Let's give this a go. We need to go over to the browser

00:08:55.690 --> 00:08:58.515
and find a board which has a list.

00:08:58.515 --> 00:09:03.125
Let's go back list two,

00:09:03.125 --> 00:09:06.090
let's click on this and change it to be list 200.

00:09:06.090 --> 00:09:09.140
We can also check side-by-side.

00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.965
List 200 American cities has been updated inside here.

00:09:14.965 --> 00:09:20.490
If we refresh, this now stays persistent inside the browser

00:09:20.490 --> 00:09:22.580
meaning this is now been stored inside

00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.710
a Firebase and we're now retrieving this in our list components.

00:09:26.710 --> 00:09:30.165
That's enough for updating the board and list.

00:09:30.165 --> 00:09:33.380
The card update, we'll have a little bit more to it.

00:09:33.380 --> 00:09:40.200
We'll begin this in the next video by creating a pop-up modal to make our changes.
