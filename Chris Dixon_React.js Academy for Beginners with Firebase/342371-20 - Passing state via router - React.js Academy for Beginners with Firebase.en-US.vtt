00:00:01.430 --> 00:00:07.995
We already know how to pass downstate when rendering components using the router,

00:00:07.995 --> 00:00:10.514
just like we did with this home components.

00:00:10.514 --> 00:00:15.180
We'll past the boards and also create new board function.

00:00:15.180 --> 00:00:17.880
Also in the board preview,

00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:22.380
we've navigated to a different route using the push method.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:24.075
Using this push method,

00:00:24.075 --> 00:00:28.110
we also sometimes have the need to pass down state to

00:00:28.110 --> 00:00:32.970
our new URL or to the component which is rendering.

00:00:32.970 --> 00:00:39.740
When we go over to the browser and then go back to our Home section,

00:00:39.740 --> 00:00:42.575
if we click on any board which you want to view,

00:00:42.575 --> 00:00:46.835
it would be a good idea to also pass the data to the ball components,

00:00:46.835 --> 00:00:50.920
such as the ball title and also the background-color.

00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:53.520
Over in the board preview,

00:00:53.520 --> 00:00:58.200
we can add state or add data just after the path-name.

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:04.765
We can also set up a state object and inside here we can pass down our board information.

00:01:04.765 --> 00:01:07.890
First of all, I'm going to pass the title.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:12.455
This ball preview has access to all of the board information

00:01:12.455 --> 00:01:17.145
which is passed from the Home components. Let's take a look.

00:01:17.145 --> 00:01:21.120
This board preview is then receiving the board as a prop.

00:01:21.120 --> 00:01:26.155
Therefore, we can access this with this top props, the board.

00:01:26.155 --> 00:01:28.635
We can access the title.

00:01:28.635 --> 00:01:33.615
We can also pass down the background too in the exact same way.

00:01:33.615 --> 00:01:35.880
This is going to be this top props,

00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.300
the Board, the background.

00:01:39.300 --> 00:01:43.400
We can try this out over in the browser, save this file,

00:01:43.400 --> 00:01:46.695
and then go back to our board previews,

00:01:46.695 --> 00:01:48.675
click on any of these,

00:01:48.675 --> 00:01:51.245
then we can use a React developer tools.

00:01:51.245 --> 00:01:53.240
We can search for the board,

00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.145
which is the current components.

00:01:55.145 --> 00:01:58.010
Select this and now inside of the props,

00:01:58.010 --> 00:02:00.875
we can also make use of this location prop,

00:02:00.875 --> 00:02:03.365
which is being passed down via the router.

00:02:03.365 --> 00:02:08.165
If we open this up, we now have a state object living inside here.

00:02:08.165 --> 00:02:11.330
Let's drop this down and now have the background

00:02:11.330 --> 00:02:14.740
and also the title available to this board.

00:02:14.740 --> 00:02:17.700
The title is Board was course Ideas.

00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.925
So let's go back and also check the House ideas.

00:02:21.925 --> 00:02:25.510
Check the board, location,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:32.280
states, and now have the house ideas are title and also the background color.

00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:36.295
Now we know where our data lives in these components.

00:02:36.295 --> 00:02:39.165
We can now use it over in the Board.

00:02:39.165 --> 00:02:43.120
Let's head over to the board.js components.

00:02:43.120 --> 00:02:46.360
First, we can set the background color of the Board.

00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:50.840
We can add this to the opening div inside of our random effort.

00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:54.310
So let's add this to a new line.

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.690
We can first add a class name and link this to the CSS,

00:02:59.690 --> 00:03:02.385
it's going to be Board wrapper.

00:03:02.385 --> 00:03:05.460
Then it just like we did with the board preview,

00:03:05.460 --> 00:03:07.750
we can also set up our styles,

00:03:07.750 --> 00:03:13.590
which is going to set the background color using camel-case,

00:03:13.590 --> 00:03:16.440
which we can grab from this top props,

00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:22.020
the location, the state, the background.

00:03:22.020 --> 00:03:24.150
Make sure it's spelled correctly.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.200
Before we go any further and add the title,

00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:30.395
we can now see the blue has appeared inside the browser.

00:03:30.395 --> 00:03:34.180
We can go back, check out the yellow course ideas.

00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:38.060
We'll do the same also for the garden ideas too.

00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:41.230
Passing the background color to our board.

00:03:41.230 --> 00:03:44.750
Just below this, we can also add a board title and

00:03:44.750 --> 00:03:48.470
also a delete board button, which you can use later.

00:03:48.470 --> 00:03:52.245
Below our div for the board-wrapper,

00:03:52.245 --> 00:03:57.215
we have the div with the class name of lists wrapper. Let's go above this.

00:03:57.215 --> 00:03:58.985
We can set to up a new div,

00:03:58.985 --> 00:04:01.655
which is going to be for the board header.

00:04:01.655 --> 00:04:07.735
So add our class name or hyphen header.

00:04:07.735 --> 00:04:10.955
Inside here, let's add a level three heading,

00:04:10.955 --> 00:04:13.430
which is going to be for the title.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:17.855
We can grab the board title using list of props,.

00:04:17.855 --> 00:04:24.285
location,.states and then the title.

00:04:24.285 --> 00:04:27.170
Just after this, we'll also add a button,

00:04:27.170 --> 00:04:30.710
which is going to be used later on in the course to delete the board.

00:04:30.710 --> 00:04:33.935
We won't add any click handlers onto here just yet.

00:04:33.935 --> 00:04:37.590
Instead, we'll just start at the text of delete board.

00:04:37.670 --> 00:04:41.210
Now we can save this and go to the browser.

00:04:41.210 --> 00:04:47.160
We have our delete board button in the corner and also our board title.

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:53.425
A [inaudible] we have course ideas and also the House ideas too.

00:04:53.425 --> 00:04:58.190
Now our background color and also our board title has been passed to

00:04:58.190 --> 00:05:02.885
this board components using the state object via the React router.

00:05:02.885 --> 00:05:04.310
This is on our work in,

00:05:04.310 --> 00:05:09.629
so I will see you now in the next section where we'll get to work using Firebase.
