00:00:00.650 --> 00:00:04.020
This course is completely project-based,

00:00:04.020 --> 00:00:06.630
meaning we're going to be building this Trello inspired

00:00:06.630 --> 00:00:10.485
application right from the beginning of the course to the end.

00:00:10.485 --> 00:00:13.185
We're going to be adding to this step-by-step,

00:00:13.185 --> 00:00:16.815
as we learn more about React and Firebase during the course.

00:00:16.815 --> 00:00:20.220
We're going to put it into practice everything we'll learn about React

00:00:20.220 --> 00:00:23.925
straight into this project so you can see it in practice.

00:00:23.925 --> 00:00:28.705
The project which will build on throughout the course is going to be inspired by Trello.

00:00:28.705 --> 00:00:30.625
If you've not used Trello before,

00:00:30.625 --> 00:00:35.825
it's basically an application which will allow us to organize things by creating boards,

00:00:35.825 --> 00:00:39.985
which is a board for a certain subject where we can add lists and cards,

00:00:39.985 --> 00:00:41.280
we can list ideas,

00:00:41.280 --> 00:00:42.375
we can create labels,

00:00:42.375 --> 00:00:44.025
and so much more.

00:00:44.025 --> 00:00:47.780
In this application, we're going to begin on the home screen by

00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:51.665
allowing users to login with a e-mail and password.

00:00:51.665 --> 00:00:55.870
The authentication will be handled on the back-end using Firebase.

00:00:55.870 --> 00:00:59.405
This will give us a secure login and sign up facility,

00:00:59.405 --> 00:01:01.685
where users can then register.

00:01:01.685 --> 00:01:03.470
They can then create boards.

00:01:03.470 --> 00:01:07.855
For example, we can set up our ideas for summer.

00:01:07.855 --> 00:01:09.615
We can create this board, we can give it

00:01:09.615 --> 00:01:13.035
a different background color, let's go for green.

00:01:13.035 --> 00:01:14.470
We can create this board.

00:01:14.470 --> 00:01:17.090
This is now saved to the back-end database,

00:01:17.090 --> 00:01:19.105
which is provided by Firebase.

00:01:19.105 --> 00:01:21.180
We can then go into our board,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:24.620
we can create new lists to section our content.

00:01:24.620 --> 00:01:33.330
For example, we can say places to visit and also create a new list, things to do.

00:01:33.800 --> 00:01:37.490
Each one of these lists can have individual cards,

00:01:37.490 --> 00:01:39.920
and we can add as many of these cards as we like.

00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.610
Let's say visited Paris.

00:01:42.610 --> 00:01:45.300
We can then click on this edits.

00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:46.935
We can edit the text,

00:01:46.935 --> 00:01:48.690
we can add labels,

00:01:48.690 --> 00:01:51.350
we can remove them by clicking on them once more,

00:01:51.350 --> 00:01:55.780
we can then save our changes and this are then displayed in inside of each card.

00:01:55.780 --> 00:01:57.900
We can add cast over list,

00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:59.970
such as paint house.

00:01:59.970 --> 00:02:02.525
This can also be clicked on and edited.

00:02:02.525 --> 00:02:06.065
We can add various labels, save our changes,

00:02:06.065 --> 00:02:08.600
and all of these changes are pushed immediately to

00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:12.895
Firebase and then updated in real time in our application.

00:02:12.895 --> 00:02:14.810
This means that we don't need to refresh

00:02:14.810 --> 00:02:18.230
our application to then get the data back from our back-end.

00:02:18.230 --> 00:02:21.440
This is all immediately updated, as you see here.

00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:24.140
We can also delete our cards, our lists,

00:02:24.140 --> 00:02:25.780
and also our boards,

00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:27.975
and these all link together too.

00:02:27.975 --> 00:02:30.270
For example, when we create a new board, list,

00:02:30.270 --> 00:02:33.995
or card, these all created by a certain user.

00:02:33.995 --> 00:02:37.940
The user ID is stored into each one, meaning for example,

00:02:37.940 --> 00:02:41.210
if we go into one of these boards and then we delete this,

00:02:41.210 --> 00:02:47.305
this will also delete the corresponding lists and cards which are linked to each board.

00:02:47.305 --> 00:02:50.945
We can also log in with multiple users,

00:02:50.945 --> 00:02:55.760
and each user will only have access to their own boards which you have created,

00:02:55.760 --> 00:03:00.070
and you can see this if we log out and then log in as a different user.

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:02.550
Click on the login button.

00:03:02.550 --> 00:03:05.630
Then we're redirected to our board's view where we

00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:08.825
have a different set of boards created by this user.

00:03:08.825 --> 00:03:13.130
Let's add some example list inside here, and also boards.

00:03:13.130 --> 00:03:16.345
These are completely independent to this user.

00:03:16.345 --> 00:03:20.600
This is going to be the application which we're going to build during this course.

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:23.390
This project will allow us to demonstrate everything you need to

00:03:23.390 --> 00:03:26.740
know about React to build applications,

00:03:26.740 --> 00:03:29.239
we'll also learn a lot too about Firebase,

00:03:29.239 --> 00:03:31.160
including the real-time database,

00:03:31.160 --> 00:03:35.450
authentication, getting updates in real time, and then finally,

00:03:35.450 --> 00:03:37.790
at the end of the course, we will make our site live,

00:03:37.790 --> 00:03:42.090
where we'll push this to production for the rest of the world to see.

00:03:42.090 --> 00:03:45.695
I hope you're as excited as I am to get started with this course.

00:03:45.695 --> 00:03:49.910
In the next video, we'll run through a couple of things which are needed for this course

00:03:49.910 --> 00:03:55.379
before we then jump into the next section where we start working on this project.
