00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.030
At the moment in our project,

00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:06.420
we've shown both the home and the board components.

00:00:06.420 --> 00:00:11.025
We can see this if we go to the React developer tools inside of our app,

00:00:11.025 --> 00:00:12.555
we have this home section,

00:00:12.555 --> 00:00:17.129
look at the top here and then below it we are rendering the board components.

00:00:17.129 --> 00:00:21.405
This is because we currently have no way of switching between these.

00:00:21.405 --> 00:00:27.135
Ideally, though, what we want after logging in is to be taken to this home components,

00:00:27.135 --> 00:00:29.910
where we can then select any of these boards,

00:00:29.910 --> 00:00:33.450
we can click on it and then be taken to this board view.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:36.360
Basically, that needs to be on different pages.

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:39.710
To make this happen, we can install a router which will allow us

00:00:39.710 --> 00:00:43.825
to show certain components on certain URLs.

00:00:43.825 --> 00:00:50.420
For example, the URL of forward slash boards will render out this board components.

00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:53.320
I will also have a URL for home.

00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:57.680
Unfortunately, that react has no official router package but

00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:02.510
probably the most commonly used is the react-router-dom package,

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:05.290
which is the web version of the router.

00:01:05.290 --> 00:01:11.810
This is a mature package which is actively maintained and we can install this using NPM.

00:01:11.810 --> 00:01:13.430
On to our project,

00:01:13.430 --> 00:01:18.330
let's open up a new terminal and then inside here,

00:01:18.330 --> 00:01:19.770
we're going to run NPM.

00:01:19.770 --> 00:01:28.090
I react-router-dom, separated by hyphens, let set this off.

00:01:35.620 --> 00:01:40.550
There is different approaches we can take to set up our router in the project,

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:46.255
such as adding the router to a separate file and then importing it into our main app.

00:01:46.255 --> 00:01:49.230
We can also add it to our index.js.

00:01:49.230 --> 00:01:52.205
But since we only have a few pages to switch between,

00:01:52.205 --> 00:01:55.450
I'm going to set this up in our app.js.

00:01:55.450 --> 00:01:58.520
Let's head over there now and then up at the top,

00:01:58.520 --> 00:02:00.380
the first thing we need to do is to

00:02:00.380 --> 00:02:03.860
import the packages which we need from the browser router.

00:02:03.860 --> 00:02:05.720
These are named export,

00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:08.320
so we add these inside the curly braces.

00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:11.220
The first we need is the BrowserRouter,

00:02:11.220 --> 00:02:16.500
capital B, and then capital R separated by a comma.

00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:19.200
We also need to import the route package.

00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.790
Then third and finally,

00:02:20.790 --> 00:02:28.920
the switch is going to be imported from the router package, which is react-router-dom.

00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.930
First of all, we have this BrowserRouter.

00:02:32.930 --> 00:02:36.365
This is our actual router implementation.

00:02:36.365 --> 00:02:43.180
We will use it as a wrapper for all of our routes and uses the HTML5 history API.

00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:45.690
After this, we have the routes,

00:02:45.690 --> 00:02:50.765
this will be used to render a component for a given URL.

00:02:50.765 --> 00:02:52.800
Finally, we have switch,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.575
this is a wrapper for multiple routes.

00:02:55.575 --> 00:02:59.280
I will only ever render the first route which matches.

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:01.620
Let's give this a go and add this to

00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.010
the random method by wrapping the components with the router.

00:03:06.010 --> 00:03:09.005
Down to our random method,

00:03:09.005 --> 00:03:11.630
where I will put our home on board,

00:03:11.630 --> 00:03:14.950
surrounding these two components inside the div.

00:03:14.950 --> 00:03:17.800
Then I want to make use of the BrowserRouter,

00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:19.640
which we just imported,

00:03:19.640 --> 00:03:24.715
so the opening tag, and then add the closing tag just after the board.

00:03:24.715 --> 00:03:27.130
We can then come and find our board and

00:03:27.130 --> 00:03:31.910
our home components and then make use of the router to control this.

00:03:31.910 --> 00:03:34.760
I'm going to begin with the board route.

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.935
The home route takes the props so we'll come back to this very soon.

00:03:38.935 --> 00:03:45.300
Let's make use of our Routing part with a capital R, this is self-closing.

00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:51.190
Then inside we pass in the path which is going to be equal to forward slash board,

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:55.580
so each time the user visits these routes of forward slash board,

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:58.404
but then want to render out a component,

00:03:58.404 --> 00:04:00.525
we can add the components,

00:04:00.525 --> 00:04:03.470
and this one is going to be the board components,

00:04:03.470 --> 00:04:05.930
and this needs a capital B, to match

00:04:05.930 --> 00:04:09.925
the components which we imported at the top of this file.

00:04:09.925 --> 00:04:12.375
Back onto our router,

00:04:12.375 --> 00:04:14.400
another route which we need is

00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.260
a PageNotFound to catch all of your route which we don't add inside here.

00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.810
Just underneath our board,

00:04:21.810 --> 00:04:23.890
let's add a second route.

00:04:23.890 --> 00:04:26.270
We don't need to add a path this time because this will pick

00:04:26.270 --> 00:04:29.360
up all of the paths which are not declared above.

00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.125
Instead, all we need to do is to render out a component.

00:04:33.125 --> 00:04:39.745
I'm going to add a component called Page Not Found, then close this off.

00:04:39.745 --> 00:04:43.115
This component has not yet been created,

00:04:43.115 --> 00:04:48.890
so we can go ahead and do this now inside of components and rampages,

00:04:48.890 --> 00:04:50.915
let's add a new file.

00:04:50.915 --> 00:04:54.030
This is the PageNotFound.js.

00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:57.825
It's function will be pretty simple.

00:04:57.825 --> 00:05:03.010
I'm going to import React from here and then set this up as

00:05:03.010 --> 00:05:12.190
a function based component called PageNotFound because of the function,

00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:16.675
then inside here we're going to add a div.

00:05:16.675 --> 00:05:19.840
This div is simply going to render out a level three

00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:24.050
heading with the text of PageNotFound.

00:05:25.670 --> 00:05:32.555
Now we need to export this function down at the very bottom with a export default,

00:05:32.555 --> 00:05:35.390
the component name of PageNotFound.

00:05:35.390 --> 00:05:40.675
This will now allow us to import this in the app.js, so up at the top,

00:05:40.675 --> 00:05:45.970
we can import PageNotFound from the file path,

00:05:45.970 --> 00:05:48.325
which is dot slash components.

00:05:48.325 --> 00:05:54.410
This is also in the Pages folder and then the name of PageNotFound.

00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:58.960
Let's give this a save now and go to the browser,

00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:04.110
I have a error, BrowserRouter,

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:07.420
so down on line 23,

00:06:07.550 --> 00:06:10.140
just add an R inside of that.

00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:11.910
Then alter the browser,

00:06:11.910 --> 00:06:15.940
so currently we're on the routes of 123 slash forwards.

00:06:15.940 --> 00:06:18.055
Now we'll get the PageNotFound,

00:06:18.055 --> 00:06:21.290
since this doesn't match any of the routes inside here.

00:06:21.290 --> 00:06:23.575
If we now try forward slash board,

00:06:23.575 --> 00:06:26.150
we should now see this board component rendered

00:06:26.150 --> 00:06:30.540
out to change our URL to be forward slash board.

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:37.855
Now I see the board rendered out inside the browser, good.

00:06:37.855 --> 00:06:39.680
Just before we wrap up this video,

00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:44.510
I want to show you something which may catch you out when first using the browser router.

00:06:44.510 --> 00:06:48.220
If we go back over to the app.js.

00:06:48.220 --> 00:06:52.010
First of all, if we comment out the PageNotFound,

00:06:52.010 --> 00:06:55.265
and then we add one more route just above here.

00:06:55.265 --> 00:06:58.400
Those off, and then we can add a path which

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:01.675
is going to be for the whole route of forward slash,

00:07:01.675 --> 00:07:05.460
so inside here you can render out any component.

00:07:05.460 --> 00:07:08.535
Let's simply go for the PageNotFound.

00:07:08.535 --> 00:07:10.790
If we save this file now and go over to

00:07:10.790 --> 00:07:15.010
the browser and then navigate to forward slash board,

00:07:15.010 --> 00:07:20.945
we see both the boards is rendered out and also the PageNotFound components,

00:07:20.945 --> 00:07:24.970
even though we're matching a URL of forward slash board.

00:07:24.970 --> 00:07:29.915
This may look a little strange because currently on the forward slash board routes,

00:07:29.915 --> 00:07:33.320
we will not want to render out the components of board.

00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:37.160
The reason this is happening is because technically,

00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:40.795
the home forward slash is also a match here too.

00:07:40.795 --> 00:07:43.445
If we look at forward slash board,

00:07:43.445 --> 00:07:46.055
this also begins with a forward slash,

00:07:46.055 --> 00:07:49.610
so we'll have a partial match at the beginning of the URL.

00:07:49.610 --> 00:07:52.130
This is enough to render the home component

00:07:52.130 --> 00:07:55.460
two and if we don't want this type of behavior,

00:07:55.460 --> 00:07:59.885
we can also add exact to the route, which will avoid this.

00:07:59.885 --> 00:08:03.395
Inside of our route we can add exact.

00:08:03.395 --> 00:08:08.295
Save this, and now on forward slash board,

00:08:08.295 --> 00:08:14.390
we only see the board component since using exact will not allow any partial matches,

00:08:14.390 --> 00:08:16.910
so I'm just going to reinstate our app,

00:08:16.910 --> 00:08:19.625
I uncomment out on PageNotFound.

00:08:19.625 --> 00:08:23.645
But this is something to watch out for when using the router.

00:08:23.645 --> 00:08:27.410
Next, we're going to move on to looking at how we can reintroduce

00:08:27.410 --> 00:08:32.820
the home components and also how we can pass down props using the router.
