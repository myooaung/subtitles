00:00:00.440 --> 00:00:04.925
If we click on any of our cards and open up the edit modal,

00:00:04.925 --> 00:00:07.460
this is currently a text input,

00:00:07.460 --> 00:00:11.110
which will only allow us to add texts onto one single line.

00:00:11.110 --> 00:00:14.790
It will be better if our cards could have multi-line text,

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:18.085
and the card would expand to fit each line.

00:00:18.085 --> 00:00:23.310
To do this I'm going to add a package called react-autosize-textarea,

00:00:23.310 --> 00:00:26.220
which will allow us to add these to project.

00:00:26.220 --> 00:00:28.465
This will give us a textarea,

00:00:28.465 --> 00:00:31.640
which will also resize the height of the card,

00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:34.415
based on the number of lines of text.

00:00:34.415 --> 00:00:40.665
Let's go over to VS code and add this to our project. Down at the bottom.

00:00:40.665 --> 00:00:44.270
I'm going to close down server with Control C,

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:46.220
and then we can run and npm

00:00:46.220 --> 00:00:56.880
i react- autosize- textarea. Then let's run this-
