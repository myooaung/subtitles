00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.120
There's a couple of things we now need to do to handle the end of the game.

00:00:04.120 --> 00:00:07.840
When we see the end of game screen and just like we do over on the right.

00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:11.480
We also want to re-introduce our newGameButton.

00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.620
This is one over in our index-html.

00:00:14.900 --> 00:00:17.020
This one just here,

00:00:17.020 --> 00:00:19.930
which is going to basically refresh the browser,

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:22.765
so we can then select our game mode.

00:00:22.765 --> 00:00:25.825
We're also going to make sure once the game is over,

00:00:25.825 --> 00:00:30.035
that the play can no longer add any values into this input field.

00:00:30.035 --> 00:00:32.260
If we keep going inside here,

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:33.760
we can still enter values,

00:00:33.760 --> 00:00:36.610
and they are still logged as our previous attempts,

00:00:36.610 --> 00:00:38.680
and also pushed to the array.

00:00:38.680 --> 00:00:43.640
To do this, we're going to go over to our script and create a game ended function.

00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.125
Over the top, just below our variables is where I want to create mine.

00:00:48.125 --> 00:00:51.360
The function name of gameEnded.

00:00:53.060 --> 00:00:58.360
Step 1 is going to be to re-introduce our newGameButton.

00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:02.010
Index, this is the ID of newGameButton.

00:01:02.010 --> 00:01:05.510
We can do this by resetting the display type.

00:01:05.510 --> 00:01:10.885
Just below here, we set this newGameButton to be the display type of none.

00:01:10.885 --> 00:01:15.555
Let's copy this line and add this into our gameEnded function.

00:01:15.555 --> 00:01:19.775
All we need to do is to change the display type to be in line.

00:01:19.775 --> 00:01:23.510
Just after this, we're also going to add a new attribute to

00:01:23.510 --> 00:01:27.275
this input field so this is one just here.

00:01:27.275 --> 00:01:30.830
We're going to set this to be read-only as soon as the game has ended,

00:01:30.830 --> 00:01:34.475
so the user can no longer enter any new values.

00:01:34.475 --> 00:01:39.870
The first step is to grab these elements and the ID,

00:01:39.870 --> 00:01:41.475
which we're going to grab this by.

00:01:41.475 --> 00:01:44.170
Here's our inputBox.

00:01:44.710 --> 00:01:48.275
We can see this over in our index page.

00:01:48.275 --> 00:01:54.050
This is our input and the ID of inputBox and to add a new attribute to our elements,

00:01:54.050 --> 00:01:57.410
we can use a method called setAttributes.

00:01:57.410 --> 00:02:02.705
The first thing we need to enter is the attribute name, which is read-only.

00:02:02.705 --> 00:02:06.290
I'm going to set this to a value of read-only.

00:02:06.290 --> 00:02:10.780
We now need to call this game ended function once we complete the game.

00:02:10.780 --> 00:02:13.920
Scroll down to our compareGuess function,

00:02:13.920 --> 00:02:15.720
which is just here,

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:18.140
and our game is effectively over in any of

00:02:18.140 --> 00:02:22.200
these sections where we call either correct or you lose.

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:28.650
Starting from the top, the first correct section or you lose is this one just here.

00:02:28.650 --> 00:02:32.075
We can then call our gameEnded function.

00:02:32.075 --> 00:02:35.550
Let's copy this and keep going down.

00:02:35.550 --> 00:02:37.340
We also have YOU LOSE section here,

00:02:37.340 --> 00:02:39.035
which means the game is over.

00:02:39.035 --> 00:02:41.275
We can also call our function,

00:02:41.275 --> 00:02:43.485
we have a YOU LOSE section.

00:02:43.485 --> 00:02:45.780
The game is over, and finally,

00:02:45.780 --> 00:02:51.300
we have a correct section down at the very bottom where we can call the same function.

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:54.195
Over to the browser, and let's check this out.

00:02:54.195 --> 00:02:56.195
We'll go for the Hard mode,

00:02:56.195 --> 00:02:59.710
and let's quickly enter any value used to end our game.

00:02:59.710 --> 00:03:03.040
We lose, we see the new game button,

00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:07.700
and we can now no longer had any new values into our input field.

00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:11.075
However, now if we try to click on the new game button,

00:03:11.075 --> 00:03:14.000
we don't see anything happen inside the browser.

00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.095
All we're going to do to this button is to enable it to reload the browser,

00:03:18.095 --> 00:03:21.115
which is going to take us back to the start screen.

00:03:21.115 --> 00:03:23.100
Over in our index.html,

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.655
we can add onclick event handler to this button.

00:03:26.655 --> 00:03:30.555
In the opening tag onclick.

00:03:30.555 --> 00:03:38.595
I'm going to set this to a new function called newGame. Back to our script.

00:03:38.595 --> 00:03:41.640
Let's add this just on the gameEnded.

00:03:41.640 --> 00:03:47.500
This was newGame, and

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:54.500
the way we can reload the browser inside of our code is by selecting the window.location,

00:03:54.500 --> 00:03:57.380
and then call a method called reload.

00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:01.375
Let's check if this is working and end our game.

00:04:01.375 --> 00:04:04.460
At any random values inside here,

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:06.185
we now see the end screen.

00:04:06.185 --> 00:04:10.530
Click on the newGame, and we now taken him to the start screen.
