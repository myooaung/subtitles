00:00:00.080 --> 00:00:04.455
Hey, welcome to the start of this new game and this new section.

00:00:04.455 --> 00:00:06.705
This is a first look at what we're going to be building.

00:00:06.705 --> 00:00:08.460
It's a random number game,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:12.675
where the user is going to generate a random number between 1-100,

00:00:12.675 --> 00:00:15.915
and then either at 10 attempts or five attempts,

00:00:15.915 --> 00:00:18.030
whichever one the user chooses.

00:00:18.030 --> 00:00:22.860
We'll then have a chance to guess which number the computer has generated.

00:00:22.860 --> 00:00:26.370
So 1-100 is a pretty wide range, so during the game,

00:00:26.370 --> 00:00:27.960
we also get some pointers,

00:00:27.960 --> 00:00:30.960
let us know if we are too high or too low.

00:00:30.960 --> 00:00:33.600
Our guess of 50 is too high,

00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:37.030
meaning our current range is now at 0-50,

00:00:37.030 --> 00:00:39.590
and the number is somewhere in this section.

00:00:39.590 --> 00:00:44.435
We also see the number of previous attempts at the bottom and we also make a log

00:00:44.435 --> 00:00:49.430
of the previous guesses so the user knows which ones they have selected in the past.

00:00:49.430 --> 00:00:55.845
Let's go for 20, 10, and 1.

00:00:55.845 --> 00:00:58.035
Now, our number is between one and 10.

00:00:58.035 --> 00:01:01.275
Let's go for 5, 2,

00:01:01.275 --> 00:01:03.620
and now we've got this in six attempts.

00:01:03.620 --> 00:01:05.360
The number was two.

00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:08.225
Then we have the option to select a new game

00:01:08.225 --> 00:01:11.590
and start again with the easy or the hard mode.

00:01:11.590 --> 00:01:16.100
As ever, we're going to begin by creating the user interface with HTML.

00:01:16.100 --> 00:01:18.050
We're going to create this section here,

00:01:18.050 --> 00:01:19.505
which is a wrapper,

00:01:19.505 --> 00:01:22.390
and then inside, we are going to create two sections.

00:01:22.390 --> 00:01:24.790
The first one is going to be the wrapper for

00:01:24.790 --> 00:01:27.310
everything we see on the start screen just here,

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:31.210
including the text and also the two buttons.

00:01:31.210 --> 00:01:35.395
The second section is going to be the game area which you see here.

00:01:35.395 --> 00:01:40.355
Let's get started over on the desktop by creating a new project folder.

00:01:40.355 --> 00:01:44.320
We want to call this one Guess a Number.

00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:51.020
Then drag this over in the text editor to open this up.

00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.750
We can either create a new file by clicking on this icon just here,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.080
or use Command or Control N to create a new file,

00:01:59.080 --> 00:02:02.825
which is going to be the index.html.

00:02:02.825 --> 00:02:06.630
Let's add some HTML structure to this document.

00:02:06.630 --> 00:02:10.000
I'm going to use the Emmet command, which is HTML:5.

00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:15.045
The document title of guess a number game.

00:02:15.045 --> 00:02:17.590
Then down in the body, we'll create our main section,

00:02:17.590 --> 00:02:22.935
which is the wrapper for both of our start screen and also the game area.

00:02:22.935 --> 00:02:26.865
We'll create our div, which is going to be the welcome screen.

00:02:26.865 --> 00:02:29.535
Let's give this an ID of welcome screen,

00:02:29.535 --> 00:02:30.900
and also just after this,

00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:33.465
we'll create our second section.

00:02:33.465 --> 00:02:37.270
This one will have an ID of game area.

00:02:38.350 --> 00:02:41.110
Let's start in the very first section,

00:02:41.110 --> 00:02:42.480
which is the welcome screen,

00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:45.280
and this is the section which you see just here.

00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:48.475
We'll begin at the very top with a heading.

00:02:48.475 --> 00:02:52.460
Let's add this inside of our first div.

00:02:52.460 --> 00:02:56.020
The text is, guess the random number.

00:02:57.110 --> 00:03:00.400
Then we're going to add a break tag,

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:03.335
just to place the next line just below,

00:03:03.335 --> 00:03:06.360
so between one and 100.

00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:11.495
Then just after this, I'm going to create a section which is going to have

00:03:11.495 --> 00:03:15.780
the difficulty title and also the two buttons.

00:03:16.070 --> 00:03:19.250
The first one is going to have the text of

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:23.490
select difficulty setting inside of the P element.

00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:33.150
Followed by a div which is going to be the wrapper for both of our buttons.

00:03:33.150 --> 00:03:35.700
Inside of this in the CSS,

00:03:35.700 --> 00:03:37.005
we're going to give this a class,

00:03:37.005 --> 00:03:39.690
which is equal to button-wrapper,

00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:44.705
and then inside we can place our two buttons.

00:03:44.705 --> 00:03:49.650
The top button is for our easy setting.

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:54.630
We can add the text of easy and also 10 attempts.

00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.080
Followed by a second button,

00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.240
and this one is for the hard mode,

00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:03.010
and this is five attempts.

00:04:04.130 --> 00:04:07.790
Let's open this up in the browser and see how this looks.

00:04:07.790 --> 00:04:11.509
Let's copy the path for our index,

00:04:11.509 --> 00:04:14.910
and then paste this into a new tab.

00:04:15.290 --> 00:04:17.610
A pretty simple start screen.

00:04:17.610 --> 00:04:19.695
We just have our text and our buttons,

00:04:19.695 --> 00:04:23.240
and then we're going to move down to our game area just below.

00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:25.310
If we click on any of these buttons,

00:04:25.310 --> 00:04:27.410
we're then taken to our game area,

00:04:27.410 --> 00:04:30.350
which we are going to begin to construct now.

00:04:30.350 --> 00:04:34.730
But at the top, we're going to start with the text of your guess.

00:04:34.730 --> 00:04:36.950
But if you remember from the demo early on,

00:04:36.950 --> 00:04:39.020
we also do have a button at the top,

00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:41.690
which is going to be hidden during the game.

00:04:41.690 --> 00:04:46.640
This is going to allow us to start a new game once the game has ended.

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:51.505
The very first element we're going to have inside of our game area will be a button,

00:04:51.505 --> 00:04:53.975
and we'll show and hide this inside of our JavaScript.

00:04:53.975 --> 00:04:58.660
We're going to create an ID of new game button.

00:04:58.660 --> 00:05:02.170
This button had the text of new game.

00:05:02.950 --> 00:05:06.950
After this, we'll add a section which is going to be the wrapper for

00:05:06.950 --> 00:05:11.300
the text at the top of your guess and also the input.

00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:16.290
A level 3 heading with the text of your guess.

00:05:17.450 --> 00:05:21.420
This level 3 heading is also going to be replaced during the game

00:05:21.420 --> 00:05:24.995
to let the user know if their guess was too high or too low.

00:05:24.995 --> 00:05:27.110
To do this, we can also add an ID,

00:05:27.110 --> 00:05:29.120
so we can tag this with JavaScript,

00:05:29.120 --> 00:05:32.730
and the ID I'm going to give this is text output.

00:05:33.680 --> 00:05:36.915
Followed by our input just below,

00:05:36.915 --> 00:05:39.760
with the type of number.

00:05:40.130 --> 00:05:44.795
The ID which is going to be equal to input box,

00:05:44.795 --> 00:05:48.860
which we'll use later on to grab the user's input.

00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:51.965
Then since our game is between one and 100,

00:05:51.965 --> 00:05:54.724
we're going to add the min and the max attributes.

00:05:54.724 --> 00:05:59.790
So the minimum of one and the maximum value is 100.

00:05:59.870 --> 00:06:04.550
Let's take a look. But now this is also going to be on

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.950
the same page since we haven't used JavaScript to

00:06:06.950 --> 00:06:09.620
show and hide any of these sections just yet,

00:06:09.620 --> 00:06:11.900
but that's completely fine for now.

00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:13.760
Back to our game area,

00:06:13.760 --> 00:06:16.475
and just after the section here,

00:06:16.475 --> 00:06:19.445
we're going to move down to our range section.

00:06:19.445 --> 00:06:21.545
We've got the text of current range.

00:06:21.545 --> 00:06:25.145
We'll then update our section just here as the user adds guesses,

00:06:25.145 --> 00:06:28.345
and then also a section for the progress bar.

00:06:28.345 --> 00:06:31.185
Let's wrap this in a new section,

00:06:31.185 --> 00:06:35.140
and the P element of current range,

00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:40.445
followed by a span element which is going to be for our text,

00:06:40.445 --> 00:06:43.115
which is currently 1-100.

00:06:43.115 --> 00:06:47.885
This text is also updated during the game so we can add an ID to this span.

00:06:47.885 --> 00:06:50.165
We can change this with JavaScript,

00:06:50.165 --> 00:06:53.700
and the ID I'm going to go for is range output.

00:06:53.990 --> 00:06:57.530
After this, we're going to create our range area.

00:06:57.530 --> 00:07:01.835
Now, this is going to be created by using a div as a wrapper,

00:07:01.835 --> 00:07:03.260
and then nested inside,

00:07:03.260 --> 00:07:05.345
we're going to create three sections.

00:07:05.345 --> 00:07:07.140
Let's add some guesses inside of here.

00:07:07.140 --> 00:07:10.710
So let's go for 50 and 90.

00:07:10.710 --> 00:07:12.800
We're going to have this green section in the middle,

00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:14.330
which is the current range,

00:07:14.330 --> 00:07:16.595
which the user is in between.

00:07:16.595 --> 00:07:19.970
Currently, our number is between 50 and 90,

00:07:19.970 --> 00:07:23.050
so we want to have this space section just here.

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:24.740
Then either side we're going to have

00:07:24.740 --> 00:07:28.800
a high and low section to fill in the rest of the space.

00:07:29.270 --> 00:07:34.905
This div here is for our wrapper and we'll give this an ID of range.

00:07:34.905 --> 00:07:40.050
Then nested inside, we're going to create three separate span elements.

00:07:40.670 --> 00:07:45.250
The first one is going to be for our low section,

00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:48.950
and let's duplicate this two more times.

00:07:48.950 --> 00:07:53.075
The middle one is our green section and we'll call this space,

00:07:53.075 --> 00:07:56.285
and then at the end, this is high.

00:07:56.285 --> 00:07:59.650
This will be our first red section on the left,

00:07:59.650 --> 00:08:01.480
the green section in the middle,

00:08:01.480 --> 00:08:03.895
and then the red section over on the right.

00:08:03.895 --> 00:08:09.205
Our final section right at the very bottom is going to be for our stats.

00:08:09.205 --> 00:08:11.055
This is going to be logging

00:08:11.055 --> 00:08:15.870
our previous number of attempts and also the previous guesses.

00:08:15.870 --> 00:08:19.665
The first of this section is going to be stats,

00:08:19.665 --> 00:08:21.525
and then nested inside,

00:08:21.525 --> 00:08:23.145
this will have two divs.

00:08:23.145 --> 00:08:25.530
The first div is going to be for the number of

00:08:25.530 --> 00:08:30.075
previous attempts and we'll give this a class of info,

00:08:30.075 --> 00:08:34.300
with the text of number of previous attempts.

00:08:37.640 --> 00:08:40.700
We'll then have a span just afterwards and this is

00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:43.790
going to be for this number which we see here.

00:08:43.790 --> 00:08:46.460
For now, we'll just add a value of zero,

00:08:46.460 --> 00:08:52.230
and then we'll update this in JavaScript later on by selecting the ID of attempts.

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:56.080
The section below is just going to be pretty much the same,

00:08:56.080 --> 00:09:01.055
so we can copy this div section, paste this in.

00:09:01.055 --> 00:09:03.665
This also has the same class of info,

00:09:03.665 --> 00:09:06.215
so it has consistent CSS.

00:09:06.215 --> 00:09:10.170
But this time, the text is your previous guesses.

00:09:12.980 --> 00:09:16.780
The ID is also going to be guesses,

00:09:16.780 --> 00:09:20.000
and then display a dash inside the browser.

00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.084
Let's check this out by reloading,

00:09:23.084 --> 00:09:26.015
and this leaves all of our HTML content in place,

00:09:26.015 --> 00:09:29.190
ready for our styling in the next video.
