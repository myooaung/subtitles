1
00:00:00,989 --> 00:00:01,651
In this example,

2
00:00:01,651 --> 00:00:05,040
I'm going to show a very simple 2-week sprint where we are

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,362
working 8 hours a day just to keep it simple.

4
00:00:08,362 --> 00:00:12,153
Your hours per day will likely vary, and that's totally fine.

5
00:00:12,153 --> 00:00:16,480
Here is day 1 and it leads off with a 2-hour Scrum planning meeting,

6
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:18,201
followed by daily work.

7
00:00:18,201 --> 00:00:21,531
Each of the following days of the week is led off by

8
00:00:21,531 --> 00:00:23,108
a daily scrum standup meeting.

9
00:00:23,108 --> 00:00:26,602
It will likely last about 15 minutes with possible follow-on

10
00:00:26,602 --> 00:00:29,964
sub-meetings to address any users or blockers.

11
00:00:29,964 --> 00:00:32,201
And the next three days are basically the same.

12
00:00:32,201 --> 00:00:35,999
Now the next four days of the sprint move along in a similar way.

13
00:00:35,999 --> 00:00:39,535
On the last day, we perform a demo of working software,

14
00:00:39,535 --> 00:00:44,424
and at the end of the day we perform our review and retrospective.

15
00:00:44,424 --> 00:00:49,609
So to recap, a complete sprint is comprised of the sprint planning upfront,

16
00:00:49,609 --> 00:00:52,960
scrums and daily work, and end with a demo,

17
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,262
review, and retrospective.

18
00:00:55,262 --> 00:00:58,641
Of course, this is the perfect model, and life is not perfect.

19
00:00:58,641 --> 00:01:05,000
You may adapt and be flexible based on your team, based on your environment, and things like that.
