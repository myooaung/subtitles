1
00:00:00,574 --> 00:00:03,797
The sprint demonstration is focused on improving the product

2
00:00:03,797 --> 00:00:06,799
and is attended by the extended team and,

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:08,385
in particular, the product owner.

4
00:00:08,385 --> 00:00:11,674
So what you want to do is recap the feature and stories

5
00:00:11,674 --> 00:00:14,241
that we're committed to in the sprint.

6
00:00:14,241 --> 00:00:17,417
Maybe have a visible list of the features or stories to ensure

7
00:00:17,417 --> 00:00:19,498
everyone understands and remembers them.

8
00:00:19,498 --> 00:00:22,775
Next, mark those that were, in fact, completed.

9
00:00:22,775 --> 00:00:24,961
Some of those features may not have been completed,

10
00:00:24,961 --> 00:00:29,917
hence you want to set the expectation accordingly and also make it clear

11
00:00:29,917 --> 00:00:33,873
that the features and stories not completed will be discussed in the next

12
00:00:33,873 --> 00:00:38,318
sprint planning meeting and be either placed into the next sprint's backlog

13
00:00:38,318 --> 00:00:41,064
or maybe even pushed out or eliminated.

14
00:00:41,064 --> 00:00:43,126
Itemize additional features, if any,

15
00:00:43,126 --> 00:00:45,960
that were added during the sprint to the backlog.

16
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:46,384
Now,

17
00:00:46,384 --> 00:00:50,457
demonstrate the working code of those committed features to

18
00:00:50,457 --> 00:00:53,399
all stakeholders and interested partners.

19
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,123
Be sure completed feature or user stories are demonstrated to

20
00:00:57,123 --> 00:01:01,014
the level necessary to ensure everyone understands that they

21
00:01:01,014 --> 00:01:03,033
work and that they have value.

22
00:01:03,033 --> 00:01:04,762
The demo is not just for the stakeholders,

23
00:01:04,762 --> 00:01:09,599
of course, but other interested partners and the full dev team.

24
00:01:09,599 --> 00:01:14,188
Much can be learned by the team by listening to the product owner

25
00:01:14,188 --> 00:01:17,101
and other stakeholders provide their feedback.

26
00:01:17,101 --> 00:01:22,319
And lastly, shared feedback and recommended changes back to the product owner.

27
00:01:22,319 --> 00:01:25,852
These sessions will provide absolutely invaluable information to

28
00:01:25,852 --> 00:01:29,692
be used in the next sprint planning session.

29
00:01:29,692 --> 00:01:31,474
And also, allow enough time.

30
00:01:31,474 --> 00:01:33,987
Maybe it's 30 minutes, or maybe it's 2 hours.

31
00:01:33,987 --> 00:01:39,296
Be flexible, and adapt the time to the amount of story points completed.

32
00:01:39,296 --> 00:01:40,385
Demonstrations are critical,

33
00:01:40,385 --> 00:01:48,000
and it gives you a chance to shine and show all of your great work to the product owner.
