00:00:01,329 --> 00:00:05,414
Here is the summary of the key points and takeaways of this module.

2
00:00:05,414 --> 00:00:05,865
Estimation.

3
00:00:05,865 --> 00:00:09,119
We learn that solid estimating skills are critical

4
00:00:09,119 --> 00:00:12,793
to the Agile team's productivity, reliability,

5
00:00:12,793 --> 00:00:15,017
and predictability of sprint planning.

6
00:00:15,017 --> 00:00:18,784
Velocity is the amount of work a team can produce in a single sprint.

7
00:00:18,784 --> 00:00:21,871
Knowing your velocity helps you better predict the amount of

8
00:00:21,871 --> 00:00:25,442
work you can commit to in your sprint planning.

9
00:00:25,442 --> 00:00:29,243
Timeboxing is a set length of time that is applied for Agile events,

10
00:00:29,243 --> 00:00:32,417
such as the sprint itself, the daily standup,

11
00:00:32,417 --> 00:00:35,535
and sprint planning to name the most obvious.

12
00:00:35,535 --> 00:00:39,828
Release planning a series of sprints are contained within a release,

13
00:00:39,828 --> 00:00:43,622
and a series of releases are contained in a project.

14
00:00:43,622 --> 00:00:48,723
To develop a release plan, we take as input the product vision,

15
00:00:48,723 --> 00:00:50,083
the product roadmap,

16
00:00:50,083 --> 00:00:53,220
and the product backlog and as output of the releases

17
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:55,963
with each feature and story identified.

18
00:00:55,963 --> 00:00:57,730
These would be our release goals,

19
00:00:57,730 --> 00:01:00,908
and possibly target dates and budgets are added as well.

20
00:01:00,908 --> 00:01:05,061
In sprint planning sessions, we will refine the backlog,

21
00:01:05,061 --> 00:01:08,350
estimate sprints, prioritize the backlog,

22
00:01:08,350 --> 00:01:12,500
and use our known velocity to make sprint commitments.

23
00:01:12,500 --> 00:01:12,948
Daily work.

24
00:01:12,948 --> 00:01:16,480
This is where the dev team is excelling and producing results,

25
00:01:16,480 --> 00:01:20,180
writing code, testing, and producing usable software.

26
00:01:20,180 --> 00:01:25,041
Daily scrums are an essential element of the dev team's daily activity.

27
00:01:25,041 --> 00:01:27,194
Sharing what they have done since the last standup,

28
00:01:27,194 --> 00:01:29,627
and what they plan to do today,

29
00:01:29,627 --> 00:01:32,730
and discuss any roadblocks or issues is so important.

30
00:01:32,730 --> 00:01:34,694
Based on the complexity of the issues.

31
00:01:34,694 --> 00:01:36,792
Based on the complexity of the issues,

32
00:01:36,792 --> 00:01:40,034
follow-on meetings may be conducted with a subset of the team,

33
00:01:40,034 --> 00:01:41,979
and they go and resolve that.

34
00:01:41,979 --> 00:01:43,595
Sprint demonstrations.

35
00:01:43,595 --> 00:01:46,788
Now is the chance for the team to shine and show the

36
00:01:46,788 --> 00:01:48,898
product owner the results of the sprint.

37
00:01:48,898 --> 00:01:52,573
Here you are demonstrating your workable features to the product

38
00:01:52,573 --> 00:01:56,323
owner and potentially other user representatives.

39
00:01:56,323 --> 00:01:56,776
Reviews.

40
00:01:56,776 --> 00:01:59,495
Don't forget to do your reviews.

41
00:01:59,495 --> 00:02:04,967
The sprint review is focused on improving the process that created the product,

42
00:02:04,967 --> 00:02:07,818
and it is just the development team that usually attends.

43
00:02:07,818 --> 00:02:11,372
Retrospectives are really just a team self-audit,

44
00:02:11,372 --> 00:02:14,865
and you would discuss things like what went well,

45
00:02:14,865 --> 00:02:18,100
what didn't, should we try some new things in the next sprint,

46
00:02:18,100 --> 00:02:21,086
maybe we stop doing something that we were doing.

47
00:02:21,086 --> 00:02:24,257
They tend to be more around people in relationships and

48
00:02:24,257 --> 00:02:27,046
soft skills and those kinds of things.

49
00:02:27,046 --> 00:02:30,794
Okay, as we know, life is not always perfect.

50
00:02:30,794 --> 00:02:34,634
Things can go wrong or maybe just need adjusting.

51
00:02:34,634 --> 00:02:36,032
In the next module,

52
00:02:36,032 --> 00:02:44,000
we will explore several topics to help prepare you for those contingencies. I will see you there.
