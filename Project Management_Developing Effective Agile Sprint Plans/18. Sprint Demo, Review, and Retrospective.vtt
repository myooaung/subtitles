00:00:00.991 --> 00:00:04.609
Now let's wind up this module by discussing sprint demos,

2
00:00:04.609 --> 00:00:06.559
reviews, and the retrospective,

3
00:00:06.559 --> 00:00:11.092
which are all critical to the next sprint planning session.

4
00:00:11.092 --> 00:00:12.879
Here's a quick context check.

5
00:00:12.879 --> 00:00:16.167
Remember, the sprint demo, review,

6
00:00:16.167 --> 00:00:19.295
and retrospective are the outcomes of the sprint,

7
00:00:19.295 --> 00:00:23.553
and these are still part of the iteration or sprint activities,

8
00:00:23.553 --> 00:00:26.409
which should never be overlooked, underappreciated,

9
00:00:26.409 --> 00:00:31.000
or skipped. Now let's explore each.
