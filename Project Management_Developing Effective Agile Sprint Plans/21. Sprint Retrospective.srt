1
00:00:00,972 --> 00:00:04,393
The sprint retrospective is a self-audit team exercise.

2
00:00:04,393 --> 00:00:09,604
This is the time for the team to inspect itself and create a plan for

3
00:00:09,604 --> 00:00:12,833
improvements to be enacted during the very next sprint.

4
00:00:12,833 --> 00:00:16,359
Remember, I mentioned that this activity is qualitative.

5
00:00:16,359 --> 00:00:21,380
Well, inspect how the last sprint went with regards to people and relationships,

6
00:00:21,380 --> 00:00:24,302
you know, the fuzzy stuff such as, well,

7
00:00:24,302 --> 00:00:25,297
what worked well?

8
00:00:25,297 --> 00:00:28,066
For example, moving the Scrum time from 9 A.M.

9
00:00:28,066 --> 00:00:29,211
to 7:30 A.M.

10
00:00:29,211 --> 00:00:31,924
worked best for everyone's schedules.

11
00:00:31,924 --> 00:00:33,120
What didn't work well?

12
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,167
Well, the location of the Scrum meeting was in a too noisy of a location,

13
00:00:37,167 --> 00:00:40,597
and we moved it to a conference room with more privacy.

14
00:00:40,597 --> 00:00:42,272
Any recommendations for change?

15
00:00:42,272 --> 00:00:42,617
Yes.

16
00:00:42,617 --> 00:00:46,276
For example, we added a new person to the dev team,

17
00:00:46,276 --> 00:00:51,338
and they requested some additional training on Angular and React technologies.

18
00:00:51,338 --> 00:00:51,573
Also,

19
00:00:51,573 --> 00:00:55,588
I would like to consider feedback from the previous retrospectives and review

20
00:00:55,588 --> 00:01:00,373
the success or progress of those actions and recommendations.

21
00:01:00,373 --> 00:01:05,707
So now, agree on new changes or actions as a team with full consensus,

22
00:01:05,707 --> 00:01:06,556
if possible.

23
00:01:06,556 --> 00:01:11,397
Then, implement those changes or actions in the very next sprint.

24
00:01:11,397 --> 00:01:15,305
Again, if possible, but the sooner you make them, the better.

25
00:01:15,305 --> 00:01:16,958
Now, as necessary,

26
00:01:16,958 --> 00:01:21,487
you can change up the attendees if it makes sense to you and your team to do so.

27
00:01:21,487 --> 00:01:25,895
You may even consider having one meeting with two major agenda items,

28
00:01:25,895 --> 00:01:28,873
the review and then the second part of the meeting,

29
00:01:28,873 --> 00:01:32,110
the retrospective, rather than separate meetings for each,

30
00:01:32,110 --> 00:01:33,810
thus saving people's time.

31
00:01:33,810 --> 00:01:38,786
I would suggest that the product owner is only in the demo meeting and not

32
00:01:38,786 --> 00:01:42,286
misuse their time with the review and the retrospective.

33
00:01:42,286 --> 00:01:45,847
Let's talk about how sprint outcomes impact sprint planning.

34
00:01:45,847 --> 00:01:49,241
The demonstration of working software provides

35
00:01:49,241 --> 00:01:53,057
valuable insight on backlog stories, estimates,

36
00:01:53,057 --> 00:01:54,295
and priorities.

37
00:01:54,295 --> 00:01:57,245
The review provides feedback on velocity,

38
00:01:57,245 --> 00:02:00,347
team capabilities, and estimation quality.

39
00:02:00,347 --> 00:02:03,753
The retrospective provides team self- reflection and

40
00:02:03,753 --> 00:02:06,125
improvements for the next sprint.

41
00:02:06,125 --> 00:02:11,629
All three outcomes work together collectively to improve team dynamics,

42
00:02:11,629 --> 00:02:19,000
process improvements, and, of course, ensure the highest quality software product that you can deliver.
