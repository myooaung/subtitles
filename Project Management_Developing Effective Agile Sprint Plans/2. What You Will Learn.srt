00:00:01,138 --> 00:00:04,841
In this course, Developing Effective Agile Sprint Plans,

2
00:00:04,841 --> 00:00:07,206
you will learn skills, approaches,

3
00:00:07,206 --> 00:00:13,089
and techniques to advance your essential agile and sprint planning capabilities.

4
00:00:13,089 --> 00:00:17,566
The sprint plan, and more importantly the process by which sprint plans are made,

5
00:00:17,566 --> 00:00:20,397
is the key building block of an agile project.

6
00:00:20,397 --> 00:00:23,095
This course will focus on sprint planning,

7
00:00:23,095 --> 00:00:26,112
features and user stories, developer tasks,

8
00:00:26,112 --> 00:00:30,399
backlogs, priorities, and estimates, burn down and velocity,

9
00:00:30,399 --> 00:00:33,822
slack and spikes, daily scrums and daily work,

10
00:00:33,822 --> 00:00:38,175
and lastly, sprint demos, review, and retrospectives.

11
00:00:38,175 --> 00:00:41,417
Here is the course overview of the three core modules.

12
00:00:41,417 --> 00:00:44,634
The first, Understanding the Agile Workflow.

13
00:00:44,634 --> 00:00:46,801
We will quickly review key Agile, Scrum,

14
00:00:46,801 --> 00:00:49,639
and sprint terms, definitions, roles, artifacts,

15
00:00:49,639 --> 00:00:54,097
and processes to provide the basis for this course and cover the numerous

16
00:00:54,097 --> 00:00:59,356
benefits of having a solid agile planning process and what those outcomes

17
00:00:59,356 --> 00:01:02,668
and expectations of spring planning should be.

18
00:01:02,668 --> 00:01:05,561
Next, Planning Sprints Effectively.

19
00:01:05,561 --> 00:01:08,545
You will learn the activities regarding the product backlog,

20
00:01:08,545 --> 00:01:11,425
user stories, sprit planning, sprint backlog,

21
00:01:11,425 --> 00:01:14,461
the sprint itself, daily scrum or standup,

22
00:01:14,461 --> 00:01:17,580
the potentially shippable product, and lastly,

23
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:19,658
the sprint review and retrospective.

24
00:01:19,658 --> 00:01:23,542
Included will be management activities such as sprint status,

25
00:01:23,542 --> 00:01:25,685
burndown, and developing velocities.

26
00:01:25,685 --> 00:01:30,670
The third core module, Avoiding Problems and Making Mid-sprint Corrections.

27
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:34,403
Finally, this course will not only cover the happy path of the planning process,

28
00:01:34,403 --> 00:01:37,115
but once this sprint is launched and is in flight,

29
00:01:37,115 --> 00:01:40,629
we will explore how to handle the myriad of issues that may

30
00:01:40,629 --> 00:01:44,207
affect and impede your plan such as bugs,

31
00:01:44,207 --> 00:01:50,000
staffing, spikes, incomplete work, and what other options you may have to apply to mitigate them.
