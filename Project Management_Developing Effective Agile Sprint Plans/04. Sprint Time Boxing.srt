1
00:00:01,052 --> 00:00:04,462
Sprint timeboxing is simply the length of elapsed time

2
00:00:04,462 --> 00:00:07,119
of a single sprint or iteration.

3
00:00:07,119 --> 00:00:08,968
In my observations over the years,

4
00:00:08,968 --> 00:00:12,564
a typical sprint timebox is about two or three weeks.

5
00:00:12,564 --> 00:00:15,752
Sprints can be potentially boxed in two ways.

6
00:00:15,752 --> 00:00:17,518
Let's check those out now.

7
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:21,872
There are two basic types of release or sprint plans,

8
00:00:21,872 --> 00:00:24,229
scope-boxed or timeboxed,

9
00:00:24,229 --> 00:00:27,553
and these could apply to release plans and sprint plans alike.

10
00:00:27,553 --> 00:00:30,312
A scope-boxed plan defines and determines the

11
00:00:30,312 --> 00:00:32,974
features the team will build in advance,

12
00:00:32,974 --> 00:00:35,013
but the date is uncertain.

13
00:00:35,013 --> 00:00:37,146
With a timeboxed plan,

14
00:00:37,146 --> 00:00:40,304
the specific features that the plan will include are uncertain,

15
00:00:40,304 --> 00:00:43,614
but defines and determines the date in advance.

16
00:00:43,614 --> 00:00:47,041
This is by far the most popular approach used.

17
00:00:47,041 --> 00:00:51,056
Timeboxed plans, to me, are almost always better.

18
00:00:51,056 --> 00:00:53,306
Now let's look at the benefits of timeboxed plans.

19
00:00:53,306 --> 00:00:54,614
Scope management.

20
00:00:54,614 --> 00:00:57,947
You can manage the amount of work, that is scope, that you can do.

21
00:00:57,947 --> 00:00:59,477
Prioritization decisions.

22
00:00:59,477 --> 00:01:02,096
You will need to influence people to make the challenging,

23
00:01:02,096 --> 00:01:04,235
but important prioritization decisions.

24
00:01:04,235 --> 00:01:05,300
This is important.

25
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:08,506
Customers or users typically want everything and yet do not

26
00:01:08,506 --> 00:01:11,450
consider changing the budget or due dates.

27
00:01:11,450 --> 00:01:12,174
Lower-cost stories.

28
00:01:12,174 --> 00:01:16,436
This requires a team to identify the most cost-effective

29
00:01:16,436 --> 00:01:19,114
stories and high-value stories as well,

30
00:01:19,114 --> 00:01:24,206
which are most useful or valuable alternatives that will fit into the timebox.

31
00:01:24,206 --> 00:01:25,453
Without a timebox, trust me,

32
00:01:25,453 --> 00:01:28,533
your plan will include more low-value features that may

33
00:01:28,533 --> 00:01:31,482
be forced in by your product owner.

34
00:01:31,482 --> 00:01:35,585
Now that we understand estimation's value to sprint planning,

35
00:01:35,585 --> 00:01:37,442
and what velocity is,

36
00:01:37,442 --> 00:01:41,170
and how timeboxing can better manage scope and deliver value better,

37
00:01:41,170 --> 00:01:45,953
we can dive into the details of release and sprint planning in the next section.

38
00:01:45,953 --> 00:01:47,890
But first, a point of view.

39
00:01:47,890 --> 00:01:51,827
Here's my point of view on estimation, velocity, and timeboxing.

40
00:01:51,827 --> 00:01:55,001
Most people are not comfortable making estimates.

41
00:01:55,001 --> 00:01:58,463
Since the process of making estimates is imprecise at best,

42
00:01:58,463 --> 00:02:02,490
and as engineers we appreciate and live by our preciseness,

43
00:02:02,490 --> 00:02:05,706
give them the support and trust they need to build and

44
00:02:05,706 --> 00:02:07,622
improve their estimation skills.

45
00:02:07,622 --> 00:02:11,447
Good estimation is a key component of agile planning.

46
00:02:11,447 --> 00:02:15,109
Tracking your velocity is important so you can better predict the amount

47
00:02:15,109 --> 00:02:19,064
of work you can accomplish over time in your sprints.

48
00:02:19,064 --> 00:02:22,827
And always use timeboxing and not scope- boxing since

49
00:02:22,827 --> 00:02:27,215
timeboxing drives higher value, lower cost stories.

50
00:02:27,215 --> 00:02:30,260
Else, it is simply a dog pile on requirements.

51
00:02:30,260 --> 00:02:33,708
You want to guide and manage your product owner into making

52
00:02:33,708 --> 00:02:39,000
the best business decisions possible. Now let's move on to release planning.
