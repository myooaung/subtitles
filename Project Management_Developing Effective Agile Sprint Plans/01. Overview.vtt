Hello.

2
00:00:00.641 --> 00:00:03.844
I'm Michael Krasowski from Pluralsight.

3
00:00:03.844 --> 00:00:05.574
I will be presenting the module,

4
00:00:05.574 --> 00:00:09.623
Avoiding Problems and Making Mid-sprint Corrections.

5
00:00:09.623 --> 00:00:10.579
Let's get started.

6
00:00:10.579 --> 00:00:15.377
Murphy's Law is a popular saying that says that things will go wrong

7
00:00:15.377 --> 00:00:18.739
in any given situation if you give them a chance.

8
00:00:18.739 --> 00:00:22.690
Or more commonly, whatever can go wrong, will go wrong.

9
00:00:22.690 --> 00:00:25.570
So expect things to go wrong from time to time.

10
00:00:25.570 --> 00:00:26.715
Therefore, in this module,

11
00:00:26.715 --> 00:00:30.685
I want to talk about the things that may or will happen unexpectedly

12
00:00:30.685 --> 00:00:34.678
and ideas and options on how to deal with them.

13
00:00:34.678 --> 00:00:37.474
This module is divided into two sections.

14
00:00:37.474 --> 00:00:40.487
In the first section, avoiding problems,

15
00:00:40.487 --> 00:00:42.988
we will talk about organizational, technical,

16
00:00:42.988 --> 00:00:46.697
and people challenges that may impede your progress and how

17
00:00:46.697 --> 00:00:49.586
to work through or remediate those issues.

18
00:00:49.586 --> 00:00:52.503
In the second section, making mid-sprint corrections,

19
00:00:52.503 --> 00:00:55.630
we will discuss those challenges that may appear after

20
00:00:55.630 --> 00:01:02.000
the sprint has been launched and, again, provide you with the options on dealing with them.
