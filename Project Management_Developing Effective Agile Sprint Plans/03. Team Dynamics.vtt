00:00:01.398 --> 00:00:04.980
Your team or team's learning and adjusting to Agile takes time,

2
00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:08.429
and one of the best ways to learn Agile and sprint,

3
00:00:08.429 --> 00:00:10.297
well, is just do it.

4
00:00:10.297 --> 00:00:12.315
So be patient, and, in fact,

5
00:00:12.315 --> 00:00:14.766
with each sprint you will incrementally learn and

6
00:00:14.766 --> 00:00:17.127
iterate into a well-oiled machine.

7
00:00:17.127 --> 00:00:21.018
Whether an Agile team, or any team for that matter,

8
00:00:21.018 --> 00:00:24.884
it takes time for a team to gel and work well together.

9
00:00:24.884 --> 00:00:26.900
When you add a whole new way of building software

10
00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.524
different from what they have done, possibly for many years,

11
00:00:30.524 --> 00:00:35.580
it may take longer than you think to become a high- performance Agile team.

12
00:00:35.580 --> 00:00:38.033
Be prepared for some team conflict.

13
00:00:38.033 --> 00:00:42.730
In other words, conflict may show that real communication is happening.

14
00:00:42.730 --> 00:00:45.998
When I use the word conflict, I mean differences of opinion,

15
00:00:45.998 --> 00:00:46.618
some discord,

16
00:00:46.618 --> 00:00:50.918
and even some tension in the team will likely be part of the learning process,

17
00:00:50.918 --> 00:00:52.897
so don't be too alarmed.

18
00:00:52.897 --> 00:00:56.985
For the team to be saying what they really think is so important and

19
00:00:56.985 --> 00:01:00.845
can be the foundation of productive collaboration.

20
00:01:00.845 --> 00:01:03.508
Indirect communication just wastes time.

21
00:01:03.508 --> 00:01:07.665
We always want open and honest communication at all times.

22
00:01:07.665 --> 00:01:10.193
Leave your ego at the door please.

23
00:01:10.193 --> 00:01:12.375
Promote professional behavior at all times,

24
00:01:12.375 --> 00:01:22.000
and make it clear that respect and trust are paramount for the team's success. Unprofessional behavior is never tolerated on my watch.
