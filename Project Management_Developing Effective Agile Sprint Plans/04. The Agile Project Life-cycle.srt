1
00:00:00,844 --> 00:00:05,129
In order to see just where sprint planning fits into the overall Agile project,

2
00:00:05,129 --> 00:00:07,639
let's start by walking through the Agile project lifecycle.

3
00:00:07,639 --> 00:00:12,129
So we will examine the Agile project lifecycle in detail,

4
00:00:12,129 --> 00:00:16,019
and as you will see, the Agile process groups are not phases,

5
00:00:16,019 --> 00:00:16,712
but rather,

6
00:00:16,712 --> 00:00:20,041
they are an integrated set of processes applied

7
00:00:20,041 --> 00:00:22,571
iteratively throughout the project.

8
00:00:22,571 --> 00:00:26,774
An Agile project is composed of the following: It begins with planning,

9
00:00:26,774 --> 00:00:28,240
vision, and a roadmap,

10
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:33,593
followed by one or more releases and ending with the project retrospective.

11
00:00:33,593 --> 00:00:37,764
So this is the entire Agile project from end to end.

12
00:00:37,764 --> 00:00:41,632
Now let's look at the results of the planning activity.

13
00:00:41,632 --> 00:00:45,064
Before we begin an Agile project, we need to do a few things.

14
00:00:45,064 --> 00:00:48,816
When your project has a clear and compelling vision and roadmap,

15
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:51,916
prioritizing stories is easy, or at least easier,

16
00:00:51,916 --> 00:00:54,406
for the entire project.

17
00:00:54,406 --> 00:00:59,042
A clear vision and roadmap helps justify which stories to keep,

18
00:00:59,042 --> 00:01:01,310
leave out, or better prioritize.

19
00:01:01,310 --> 00:01:01,729
Also,

20
00:01:01,729 --> 00:01:05,576
a clear vision provides a common grasp and understanding

21
00:01:05,576 --> 00:01:08,005
of what's important to the project,

22
00:01:08,005 --> 00:01:12,756
enabling a higher team morale and increases stakeholder trust.

23
00:01:12,756 --> 00:01:22,000
This all matters as we drill down into release in sprint planning. Okay, onto the next process group, the release.
