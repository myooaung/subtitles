1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:05,530
So now that we've walked through the process of deploying on SageMaker,

2
00:00:05,530 --> 00:00:08,790
we're now going to take a step back and discuss how we

3
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:11,940
secure our SageMaker implementation.

4
00:00:11,940 --> 00:00:12,900
Now before we do,

5
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:17,040
we need to cover a couple of topics that you're probably already familiar with,

6
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:20,150
and one of those is the shared responsibility model.

7
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:24,530
But it's important to revisit it and understand what aspects apply to

8
00:00:24,530 --> 00:00:28,270
working within SageMaker on your machine learning solutions.

9
00:00:28,270 --> 00:00:33,140
So first of all, let's revisit what AWS says about security and compliance,

10
00:00:33,140 --> 00:00:35,750
and they clearly state that they are a shared

11
00:00:35,750 --> 00:00:39,940
responsibility between AWS and the customer.

12
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:40,660
So in this case,

13
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:44,500
we can't simply leverage SageMaker and assume that everything is

14
00:00:44,500 --> 00:00:47,240
going to be secure with our implementation.

15
00:00:47,240 --> 00:00:50,640
So here, within this module, here's what we're going to be covering.

16
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:51,380
First of all,

17
00:00:51,380 --> 00:00:54,430
we will be reviewing the shared responsibility model in

18
00:00:54,430 --> 00:00:57,920
terms of SageMaker and even more generally just your machine

19
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,140
learning efforts on the platform.

20
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:02,710
We're going to be examining some high‑level security

21
00:01:02,710 --> 00:01:05,140
and compliance considerations.

22
00:01:05,140 --> 00:01:09,310
We'll be exploring VPC configurations for SageMaker,

23
00:01:09,310 --> 00:01:14,060
as well as controlling access to resources and data using

24
00:01:14,060 --> 00:01:17,240
IAM or identity and access management.

25
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:22,140
We'll also be reviewing how you can secure your SageMaker notebooks.

26
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:27,240
So with that being said, let's look here at the shared responsibility summary.

27
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:29,210
So there really are two different categories.

28
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:33,530
We have some things that are the responsibility of AWS,

29
00:01:33,530 --> 00:01:38,100
and this many times is phrased as the security of the cloud.

30
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,510
But then we have the other side.

31
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:42,400
Those are the things that are the customer responsibility.

32
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,740
And we'll generally call this the security in the cloud.

33
00:01:45,740 --> 00:01:47,860
And so if we look at these high‑level items,

34
00:01:47,860 --> 00:01:52,130
which again, if you've taken an AWS associate‑level certification exam,

35
00:01:52,130 --> 00:01:54,060
you've certainly walked your way through this or

36
00:01:54,060 --> 00:01:56,040
even the cloud practitioner exam.

37
00:01:56,040 --> 00:02:00,160
So here we know that it's AWS responsibility to do things like

38
00:02:00,160 --> 00:02:03,140
access and training for Amazon employees,

39
00:02:03,140 --> 00:02:06,200
for their global data centers and the underlying network,

40
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,370
hardware for global infrastructure, configuration management for infrastructure,

41
00:02:11,370 --> 00:02:14,770
and patching cloud infrastructure and services.

42
00:02:14,770 --> 00:02:17,230
So when we think about this in terms of SageMaker,

43
00:02:17,230 --> 00:02:19,930
in terms of the network that it's actually communicating on,

44
00:02:19,930 --> 00:02:22,670
in terms of the software that's actually running as

45
00:02:22,670 --> 00:02:27,340
a part of the managed service, those things are handled by AWS.

46
00:02:27,340 --> 00:02:30,030
But we have several areas of responsibility as well,

47
00:02:30,030 --> 00:02:33,150
and here we're going to take a lens to focus on those

48
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:35,240
things that relate to machine learning.

49
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:40,000
So first of all, we have individual access to cloud resources and training.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:41,970
Now the access to cloud resources,

51
00:02:41,970 --> 00:02:45,580
this is going to be specific to how we leverage identity and

52
00:02:45,580 --> 00:02:49,060
access management, or IAM, to control access to both

53
00:02:49,060 --> 00:02:52,200
SageMaker and resources like notebooks, for example,

54
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,110
and even our data that's stored in Amazon S3.

55
00:02:55,110 --> 00:02:57,740
And we'll cover that later within this module.

56
00:02:57,740 --> 00:03:00,770
Then, we have dataset security and encryption.

57
00:03:00,770 --> 00:03:05,810
And here, we're talking about both in transit and at rest,

58
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:09,640
and we'll be covering this next here within this module.

59
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:11,870
But then we have things like operating system,

60
00:03:11,870 --> 00:03:14,500
network, and firewall configuration.

61
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,010
Now one of these things that really applies when we're working with SageMaker

62
00:03:18,010 --> 00:03:23,240
is the network and firewall configuration. We can launch SageMaker into one of

63
00:03:23,240 --> 00:03:28,870
our VPCs and then control what has access into that VPC. And we can also look

64
00:03:28,870 --> 00:03:35,140
at how we handle communication within that VPC to AWS services like Amazon S3.

65
00:03:35,140 --> 00:03:40,320
We also here have the responsibility for all of the code that we deploy onto

66
00:03:40,320 --> 00:03:44,800
cloud infrastructure, as well as patching guest operating system and custom

67
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,240
applications.

68
00:03:46,240 --> 00:03:50,010
So at a high level, when we look at how we leverage the platform for

69
00:03:50,010 --> 00:03:53,440
machine learning, here are the things we need to be concerned with,

70
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:57,030
data protection. That has to do with the data security and encryption

71
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,640
that we discussed earlier.

72
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:01,520
We need to look at authentication and authorization,

73
00:04:01,520 --> 00:04:05,140
and this has to do with IAM and the work that we'll do there.

74
00:04:05,140 --> 00:04:08,040
It also has to do with compliance because for many of you,

75
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:10,790
depending on the industry or vertical that you're working in,

76
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:12,810
this can be a key area of concern.

77
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:15,760
So we will spend time later in this module talking

78
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,080
about compliance. But also, monitoring.

79
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:22,270
Now we'll be jumping into monitoring within the next module, but

80
00:04:22,270 --> 00:04:25,820
this is an area that you need to be focused on. But also, securing

81
00:04:25,820 --> 00:04:32,000
infrastructure and, especially here, the network configuration around our infrastructure.
