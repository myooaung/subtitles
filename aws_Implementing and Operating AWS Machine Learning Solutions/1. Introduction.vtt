Welcome to Implementing and Operating AWS Machine Learning Solutions,

2
00:00:05.480 --> 00:00:09.400
and this is the module AWS Machine Learning Services.

3
00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:13.850
But before we dive too deep into what we're going to be covering in this module,

4
00:00:13.850 --> 00:00:18.100
let's take a step back and let's look at the AWS Machine

5
00:00:18.100 --> 00:00:20.640
Learning Specialty Certification exam.

6
00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:23.600
So let's look at those objectives for the exam.

7
00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:26.640
First of all, we have data engineering,

8
00:00:26.640 --> 00:00:29.950
and this covers things like creating data repositories and

9
00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:33.540
looking at data ingestion and data transformation.

10
00:00:33.540 --> 00:00:38.030
Then, we have exploratory data analysis, and this covers items

11
00:00:38.030 --> 00:00:40.600
like sanitizing and preparing your data,

12
00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.620
doing feature engineering, and looking to analyze and visualize your

13
00:00:44.620 --> 00:00:49.040
data. Following that, we have modeling, and modeling is where you

14
00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:51.810
learn how to take business problems and make them into machine

15
00:00:51.810 --> 00:00:53.840
learning problems that you can solve.

16
00:00:53.840 --> 00:00:57.040
You learn how to select the appropriate model for what you're doing, you

17
00:00:57.040 --> 00:01:01.150
train your models, and you look at hyperparameter optimization and overall

18
00:01:01.150 --> 00:01:03.480
just evaluation of your machine learning models.

19
00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:06.640
Now all of these three objectives have been covered

20
00:01:06.640 --> 00:01:09.350
by previous courses in this path,

21
00:01:09.350 --> 00:01:12.360
so we're not going to be covering these items. And I'm expecting that you're

22
00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:16.290
walking in with an understanding of these three objectives.

23
00:01:16.290 --> 00:01:19.410
Now what we're going to be focused on is we're going to be focused on

24
00:01:19.410 --> 00:01:24.120
machine learning implementation and operations. And this means we're

25
00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:27.520
going to be looking at understanding how to build faultâ€‘tolerant and

26
00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:29.640
highly available machine learning solutions.

27
00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:33.370
We're going to learn how to look at the entire suite of services that AWS

28
00:01:33.370 --> 00:01:37.060
provides and try to determine which ones fit our use case.

29
00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:39.610
We're also going to look at how we apply security

30
00:01:39.610 --> 00:01:41.690
best practices and, ultimately,

31
00:01:41.690 --> 00:01:46.280
how we deploy and operationalize our machine learning models.

32
00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:47.940
So how are we going to do that?

33
00:01:47.940 --> 00:01:49.520
Well, in this initial module,

34
00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:52.680
we're going to be focused at examining the suite of services that are

35
00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:57.070
provided for machine learning on AWS, and this is going to include things

36
00:01:57.070 --> 00:02:00.240
like data ingestion and transformation services.

37
00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:03.740
And even though we have already talked about that within this path,

38
00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:06.260
we're going to be doing a focus here within this module on

39
00:02:06.260 --> 00:02:10.440
understanding use cases and how that drives what you select. We'll

40
00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:14.700
also be reviewing the different AI services for the same reason. We

41
00:02:14.700 --> 00:02:17.050
want to be able to understand that, given a use case,

42
00:02:17.050 --> 00:02:21.340
how we can take these AI services and integrate them into our workflow.

43
00:02:21.340 --> 00:02:24.240
We're then going to be exploring the different services that are provided

44
00:02:24.240 --> 00:02:28.890
in Amazon SageMaker. And then ultimately, we'll also be identifying other

45
00:02:28.890 --> 00:02:36.000
compute approaches besides SageMaker that you can use for your machine learning workflows on AWS.
