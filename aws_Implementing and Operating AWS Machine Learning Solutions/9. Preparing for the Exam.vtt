00:00:01.040 --> 00:00:05.180
So if you're going to be taking the AWS Machine Learning Specialty exam,

2
00:00:05.180 --> 00:00:08.430
there are some concepts I think it would benefit you to review

3
00:00:08.430 --> 00:00:10.910
from this module before taking the exam.

4
00:00:10.910 --> 00:00:12.260
So first of all,

5
00:00:12.260 --> 00:00:16.310
you need to understand the concepts of fault tolerance and high availability.

6
00:00:16.310 --> 00:00:19.130
So you need to understand the definition of each,

7
00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:23.070
but you also need to understand how you build machine learning solutions on

8
00:00:23.070 --> 00:00:27.640
AWS that are both fault tolerant and highly available.

9
00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:31.460
You also need to understand CloudWatch and CloudTrail.

10
00:00:31.460 --> 00:00:33.520
You need to know the use case for both.

11
00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:36.630
You need to know, for example, that CloudWatch includes both metrics,

12
00:00:36.630 --> 00:00:41.640
which we can set alarms on, but also logs that we can configure retention for.

13
00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:44.450
And you need to know about CloudTrail and the ability for it

14
00:00:44.450 --> 00:00:47.390
to provide an audit trail for actions taken against

15
00:00:47.390 --> 00:00:50.740
SageMaker or other services on AWS.

16
00:00:50.740 --> 00:00:53.190
You need to know how to implement scaling for a

17
00:00:53.190 --> 00:00:56.730
SageMakerâ€‘hosted endpoint. So you need to know how to define

18
00:00:56.730 --> 00:00:59.810
that scaling policy, what elements are included,

19
00:00:59.810 --> 00:01:02.550
that it takes a CloudWatch metric to determine when to

20
00:01:02.550 --> 00:01:05.750
scale, and that it takes a minimum and maximum number of

21
00:01:05.750 --> 00:01:08.540
instances within that scaling policy.

22
00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:12.660
You also need to understand the purpose and use of deep learning containers.

23
00:01:12.660 --> 00:01:21.000
You want to know the different services that you can leverage with deep learning containers, which are EC2, ECS, and EKS.
