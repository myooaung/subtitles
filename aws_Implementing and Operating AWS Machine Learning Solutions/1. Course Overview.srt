Hello, everyone.

2
00:00:06,630 --> 00:00:09,280
My name is David Tucker, and welcome to the course,

3
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,400
Implementing and Operating AWS Machine Learning Solutions.

4
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,310
I'm a CTO consultant, and I help organizations every day plan,

5
00:00:17,310 --> 00:00:21,410
build, and implement custom software and data solutions in the cloud.

6
00:00:21,410 --> 00:00:25,950
I have over 15 years of experience in software architecture and development.

7
00:00:25,950 --> 00:00:30,190
Machine learning implementation and operations is one of the four domains

8
00:00:30,190 --> 00:00:34,460
covered by the AWS Machine Learning Specialty certification exam.

9
00:00:34,460 --> 00:00:38,210
In this course, Implementing and Operating AWS Machine Learning Solutions,

10
00:00:38,210 --> 00:00:42,780
you'll learn key areas from this domain that are covered in the exam.

11
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:47,040
Now, when working in machine learning, training a model is only the first step.

12
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:47,830
In this course,

13
00:00:47,830 --> 00:00:50,140
I will teach you about what happens when you're ready to

14
00:00:50,140 --> 00:00:52,540
deploy the model that you've created.

15
00:00:52,540 --> 00:00:53,200
First,

16
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:56,220
you'll explore different AWS services that can support a

17
00:00:56,220 --> 00:00:58,490
machine learning solution in production.

18
00:00:58,490 --> 00:00:59,170
Next,

19
00:00:59,170 --> 00:01:01,810
you'll discover how to deploy and scale a machine

20
00:01:01,810 --> 00:01:04,250
learning model with Amazon SageMaker.

21
00:01:04,250 --> 00:01:04,860
Finally,

22
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:07,940
you'll learn how to implement security best practices for

23
00:01:07,940 --> 00:01:10,700
your machine learning solution with AWS.

24
00:01:10,700 --> 00:01:12,700
When you're finished with this course,

25
00:01:12,700 --> 00:01:25,000
you'll have the skills and knowledge in this domain that you need to prepare for the AWS Machine Learning Specialty certification exam.
