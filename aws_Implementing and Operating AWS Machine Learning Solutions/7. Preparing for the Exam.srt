1
00:00:01,040 --> 00:00:04,540
So we have covered a lot related to security and

2
00:00:04,540 --> 00:00:07,440
compliance here within this module.

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,250
And if you're going to be sitting for the AWS Machine Learning Specialty exam,

4
00:00:12,250 --> 00:00:14,490
there are some areas that I think you should review

5
00:00:14,490 --> 00:00:16,940
from this module before you do.

6
00:00:16,940 --> 00:00:17,820
First of all,

7
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:20,820
you need to understand which aspects of the shared

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:24,200
responsibility model apply to SageMaker and, even more

9
00:00:24,200 --> 00:00:27,400
generally, apply to machine learning as a whole.

10
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,730
There are things that we need to be very concerned with,

11
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,930
especially in areas like data security and understanding how that's

12
00:00:33,930 --> 00:00:36,870
implemented when you're working with SageMaker. We need to

13
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,080
understand what SageMaker puts in place to implement data security

14
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:44,100
for data in transit and data at rest,

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:47,890
as well as knowing what best practices we need to follow for services like

16
00:00:47,890 --> 00:00:52,300
Amazon S3 for dealing with data that we're pulling in for our model

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:56,650
training, just for example. You also need to be able to understand the VPC

18
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:01,020
configuration that is best suited for SageMaker use and look at the

19
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:05,640
endpoints that you can inject into your VPC for things like Amazon S3 so

20
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,230
that you can make sure that your data does not have to travel over the

21
00:01:09,230 --> 00:01:12,840
public internet, but rather can see a within your VPC.

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:13,690
In addition,

23
00:01:13,690 --> 00:01:18,230
you need to know how to secure notebooks and configure what they can access.

24
00:01:18,230 --> 00:01:21,880
Since notebooks have access to the entire internet to begin with,

25
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:25,940
you need to know how you could limit that to a specific scope and, in addition,

26
00:01:25,940 --> 00:01:36,000
know how you can leverage services like IAM to control access to your notebooks, as well as to other SageMaker resources.
