1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,030
Depending on the industry or vertical that you're working in,

2
00:00:04,030 --> 00:00:06,730
compliance might be one of your primary areas of

3
00:00:06,730 --> 00:00:10,120
consideration when choosing a platform to work with.

4
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,190
So here within this demo, we're going to be doing two different things.

5
00:00:14,190 --> 00:00:14,970
First of all,

6
00:00:14,970 --> 00:00:17,720
we're going to be reviewing which compliance programs have

7
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,270
endorsed Amazon SageMaker and show you where you can go to

8
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:23,340
do that research for yourself,

9
00:00:23,340 --> 00:00:29,540
and we'll be extracting compliance documents for an account using AWS Artifact.

10
00:00:29,540 --> 00:00:35,420
So first, I'm here in the AWS Services in Scope by Compliance Program page.

11
00:00:35,420 --> 00:00:38,830
Here, I can go down and see different areas of compliance.

12
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:41,210
For example, SOC 1, 2, and 3 compliance,

13
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:46,540
PCI compliance, HIPPA compliance, as well as many other types of compliance.

14
00:00:46,540 --> 00:00:50,040
And if I scroll down on this list or even just search for SageMaker,

15
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:54,090
I can see, for example, here that SageMaker does have SOC 1,

16
00:00:54,090 --> 00:00:58,120
2, and 3 compliance certified here within this list.

17
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:00,350
And you can go through and review that for each of the

18
00:01:00,350 --> 00:01:02,270
different areas of certification.

19
00:01:02,270 --> 00:01:02,740
Obviously,

20
00:01:02,740 --> 00:01:04,710
for different organizations that are implementing

21
00:01:04,710 --> 00:01:06,630
different machine learning solutions,

22
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:09,940
your specific compliance needs are going to be different.

23
00:01:09,940 --> 00:01:14,050
But this page will give you the latest on where SageMaker stands,

24
00:01:14,050 --> 00:01:18,140
as well as all of the other services on AWS.

25
00:01:18,140 --> 00:01:21,690
Now next, let's jump over to the AWS Management Console.

26
00:01:21,690 --> 00:01:25,240
And here within the console, we're going to use one service,

27
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,720
AWS Artifact, to be able to get compliance agreements.

28
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:32,240
So I'm going to go ahead and click on Artifact.

29
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,200
And from here, I can actually go in and view the different reports.

30
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:39,930
Now depending on what you're implementing with AWS,

31
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,120
you might also need to have agreements like a BAA, for example. Those would

32
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:47,590
be found under the Agreements section of AWS Artifact.

33
00:01:47,590 --> 00:01:48,270
However,

34
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:51,780
we're going to look at reports. If we were wanting to do a

35
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:56,020
validation on some transactions and we needed to verify PCI

36
00:01:56,020 --> 00:01:57,920
compliance for our solution,

37
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:02,040
we could simply go in here and search for PCI. And we can see, here

38
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,530
is the current PCI DSS Attestation of Compliance,

39
00:02:05,530 --> 00:02:08,970
or AOC, and Responsibility Summary, the current one.

40
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:11,360
And so we could actually select this and, from here,

41
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,930
go in and actually download the report. Now to download these reports,

42
00:02:14,930 --> 00:02:18,760
you're going to have to agree to an NDA. So you can choose to go in

43
00:02:18,760 --> 00:02:21,740
and do that within your specific account.

44
00:02:21,740 --> 00:02:24,500
But by using a combination of the services and

45
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:26,690
scope page for Amazon Web Services,

46
00:02:26,690 --> 00:02:31,080
you can see what services are in compliance with which compliance programs.

47
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:41,000
And then you can jump into AWS Artifact to get the current documentation that shows what AWS has done to meet those areas of compliance.
