00:00:01.240 --> 00:00:04.530
So one of the things that will be essential for you to know is what you

2
00:00:04.530 --> 00:00:08.370
need to pull from this module if you're getting ready to take the AWS

3
00:00:08.370 --> 00:00:11.240
Certified Machine Learning Specialty exam.

4
00:00:11.240 --> 00:00:15.510
So I want to highlight a few things that you need to review from this module.

5
00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:16.900
So first of all,

6
00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:20.440
you need to be able to identify specific use cases that

7
00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:22.820
fit each service that we discussed.

8
00:00:22.820 --> 00:00:25.510
I would recommend reviewing each of these services.

9
00:00:25.510 --> 00:00:26.170
Ideally,

10
00:00:26.170 --> 00:00:29.150
I would also recommend going in and implementing a basic

11
00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:32.290
solution with each of these services so you understand how

12
00:00:32.290 --> 00:00:34.040
they work at a detailed level.

13
00:00:34.040 --> 00:00:36.950
Now part of the reason for this is you will need to go a

14
00:00:36.950 --> 00:00:39.090
step beyond just knowing about these.

15
00:00:39.090 --> 00:00:42.170
You'll also need to know how to apply this knowledge to fit

16
00:00:42.170 --> 00:00:45.490
multiple services together into an architecture.

17
00:00:45.490 --> 00:00:48.710
So if you want to look potentially at tying together some of the AI

18
00:00:48.710 --> 00:00:52.580
services that we talked about previously or some of the data ingestion

19
00:00:52.580 --> 00:00:55.240
and transformation services in with SageMaker,

20
00:00:55.240 --> 00:00:58.310
you need to understand how to take a highâ€‘level need and how to

21
00:00:58.310 --> 00:01:01.550
apply these services to fit that need and create a custom

22
00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.040
architecture that meets those criteria.

23
00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:05.780
And next,

24
00:01:05.780 --> 00:01:09.390
you'll need to know how to troubleshoot when failures occur

25
00:01:09.390 --> 00:01:11.890
when you're implementing that architecture.

26
00:01:11.890 --> 00:01:12.690
So if you remember,

27
00:01:12.690 --> 00:01:16.700
we talked about different limitations that exist for specific services like

28
00:01:16.700 --> 00:01:19.910
Kinesis Data Firehose and the data transform feature.

29
00:01:19.910 --> 00:01:22.630
And so, there are limitations that exist there with the

30
00:01:22.630 --> 00:01:25.140
lambda execution time and the payload size.

31
00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:28.450
Make sure you familiarize yourself with what some of these limits are per

32
00:01:28.450 --> 00:01:33.220
service so that you can help to troubleshoot if issues occur because these

33
00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:40.000
are the types of questions you're likely to get when you're taking your AWS Certified Machine Learning Specialty exam.
