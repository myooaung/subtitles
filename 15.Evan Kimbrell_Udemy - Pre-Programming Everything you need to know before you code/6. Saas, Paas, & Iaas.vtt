00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.640
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.640  -->  00:00:06.410
So, in this lecture, we're going to tackle the holy trinity of the cloud,
3

3

00:00:06.410  -->  00:00:11.150
the SaaS, the PaaS, and the IaaS.
4

4

00:00:11.150  -->  00:00:13.740
First off, let's talk about the word I just used,
5

5

00:00:13.740  -->  00:00:16.420
to make sure that everyone is on the same page.
6

6

00:00:16.420  -->  00:00:18.820
Talking about that word I just said, "cloud."
7

7

00:00:18.820  -->  00:00:22.670
Now, I'm 100% sure you've heard the term "cloud" before,
8

8

00:00:22.670  -->  00:00:27.390
as in "it's saved in the cloud," or "it's connected to the cloud."
9

9

00:00:27.390  -->  00:00:32.150
When we say cloud, we don't mean an actual cloud, obviously,
10

10

00:00:32.150  -->  00:00:36.740
and we don't also mean some big, amorphous blob of technology,
11

11

00:00:36.740  -->  00:00:39.420
we're actually referring to something very specific.
12

12

00:00:39.420  -->  00:00:42.310
Cloud just means stored and accessed
13

13

00:00:42.310  -->  00:00:46.690
on a different device or server than the device I'm currently using.
14

14

00:00:46.690  -->  00:00:50.680
Traditionally, this means stored at some central location
15

15

00:00:50.680  -->  00:00:53.920
or locations operated by a service provider.
16

16

00:00:53.920  -->  00:00:56.800
Now, let's say I saved a photo to the cloud.
17

17

00:00:56.800  -->  00:00:59.550
That could mean a lot of different things.
18

18

00:00:59.550  -->  00:01:02.970
It could mean that it's stored down the street,
19

19

00:01:02.970  -->  00:01:05.770
it could also mean that it's stored on a server run by Dropbox,
20

20

00:01:05.770  -->  00:01:10.240
or one run by Google, or one run by any service that I pay for,
21

21

00:01:10.240  -->  00:01:15.180
but in all scenarios it always essentially means the same thing, which is "not here,"
22

22

00:01:15.180  -->  00:01:16.910
and that's a good way of remembering it.
23

23

00:01:16.910  -->  00:01:20.020
It's the opposite of the term we use sometimes, which is "local,"
24

24

00:01:20.020  -->  00:01:23.910
local meaning your local hard drive on the computer you have,
25

25

00:01:23.910  -->  00:01:27.170
so if it's not here, it's not on your local drive.
26

26

00:01:27.170  -->  00:01:29.830
So why do we use the cloud?
27

27

00:01:29.830  -->  00:01:33.080
Well, because internet speeds are getting faster,
28

28

00:01:33.080  -->  00:01:36.370
and our devices are connected more often than before.
29

29

00:01:36.370  -->  00:01:39.340
Mobile technology changed this considerably.
30

30

00:01:39.340  -->  00:01:44.110
We're now connected in between leaving the office and on the way home,
31

31

00:01:44.110  -->  00:01:47.740
and not just at those two locations, like it used to be.
32

32

00:01:47.740  -->  00:01:50.000
Because of that, we're getting to an intersection in technology,
33

33

00:01:50.000  -->  00:01:53.850
where people are asking the question, "Do we even need hard drives?"
34

34

00:01:53.850  -->  00:01:58.520
If I'm always connected, and my internet speed is consistently getting faster,
35

35

00:01:58.520  -->  00:02:03.940
then why don't I just store everything on a central server somewhere else
36

36

00:02:03.940  -->  00:02:08.680
and save myself the trouble of hauling my files around with me all the time?
37

37

00:02:08.680  -->  00:02:12.070
So, it's in that vein that I introduce these three concepts.
38

38

00:02:12.070  -->  00:02:17.440
Cloud is not a new trend by any means, we've been in the cloud paradigm,
39

39

00:02:17.440  -->  00:02:22.250
if you will, for at least five years, but these other concepts are quite new,
40

40

00:02:22.250  -->  00:02:28.800
like the concept of PaaS and IaaS, PaaS and...
41

41

00:02:28.800  -->  00:02:30.820
I've never heard someone pronounce that second one.
42

42

00:02:30.820  -->  00:02:33.850
To get at these concepts, let's start with the easiest to understand,
43

43

00:02:33.850  -->  00:02:37.150
and coincidentally, the most common type you see.
44

44

00:02:37.150  -->  00:02:42.620
So the first one is Saas, which is S-A-A-S, and it stands for Software as a Service.
45

45

00:02:42.620  -->  00:02:47.710
Now, what is the difference between a service and a product?
46

46

00:02:47.710  -->  00:02:50.240
Because you heard software, you probably just thought it was a product.
47

47

00:02:50.240  -->  00:02:53.780
Well, the relevant difference in this case is that
48

48

00:02:53.780  -->  00:02:57.650
a product you own and keep yourself, and a service you don't.
49

49

00:02:57.650  -->  00:03:02.600
Let's say I bought Adobe Photoshop, and I know that Adobe is changing this,
50

50

00:03:02.600  -->  00:03:07.230
but for the first ten years of their existence, this is specifically how they worked.
51

51

00:03:07.230  -->  00:03:12.230
Anyway, if I bought Photoshop, I would download that software on my computer,
52

52

00:03:12.230  -->  00:03:15.600
and then access it on my computer whenever I wanted to.
53

53

00:03:15.600  -->  00:03:18.900
I wouldn't have to connect to the internet to use it, and my computer
54

54

00:03:18.900  -->  00:03:22.680
would store everything it needs to run that system within itself.
55

55

00:03:22.680  -->  00:03:25.370
So, what I described is a product.
56

56

00:03:25.370  -->  00:03:27.670
The trend nowadays though is to say,
57

57

00:03:27.670  -->  00:03:33.380
"Hey, why mock up their hard drives, and why constantly have to deal with
58

58

00:03:33.380  -->  00:03:37.250
getting people to update their software, when we, the company,
59

59

00:03:37.250  -->  00:03:41.060
can actually just house it for them, maintain it for them,
60

60

00:03:41.060  -->  00:03:44.860
and then just lease out the use of the software to them?"
61

61

00:03:44.860  -->  00:03:47.660
That description I just gave you is what makes it a service,
62

62

00:03:47.660  -->  00:03:52.100
because they own the means of production, to use a term from Karl Marx,
63

63

00:03:52.100  -->  00:03:55.900
and you're paying for the pleasure of using it for an end result.
64

64

00:03:55.900  -->  00:03:59.110
So how would Photoshop become a SaaS tool?
65

65

00:03:59.110  -->  00:04:03.150
Well, one way would be to make a web version of their system.
66

66

00:04:03.150  -->  00:04:06.150
In that scenario, you just recreate all the tools and functions
67

67

00:04:06.150  -->  00:04:09.150
in a website that you pay to access and use.
68

68

00:04:09.150  -->  00:04:14.220
Now, alternatively, and this is what they actually did, but it's much less common,
69

69

00:04:14.220  -->  00:04:19.330
is make logging into the software only accessible through the web,
70

70

00:04:19.330  -->  00:04:22.470
and have the software they downloaded constantly
71

71

00:04:22.470  -->  00:04:25.500
check online to see if you've paid to use it,
72

72

00:04:25.500  -->  00:04:28.770
if you haven't paid it shuts off and prevents you from using it.
73

73

00:04:28.770  -->  00:04:32.850
Now, in nine out of ten cases, the option would be to go web only.
74

74

00:04:32.850  -->  00:04:36.280
Now, a great example of this would be a tool 
I use all the time, it's actually called Canva.
75

75

00:04:36.280  -->  00:04:39.050
The activities in this course were made in Canva.
76

76

00:04:39.050  -->  00:04:40.910
If you haven't used it, check it out.
77

77

00:04:40.910  -->  00:04:45.820
They created a simplified version of Photoshop, and it exists entirely in the browser.
78

78

00:04:45.820  -->  00:04:50.100
You pay per month, and then you get to access 
all the tools and functions they've created.
79

79

00:04:50.100  -->  00:04:55.530
You can even save your files and work on their 
systems, and then access it any time you login.
80

80

00:04:55.530  -->  00:04:57.250
The advantages of Saas are pretty obvious.
81

81

00:04:57.250  -->  00:04:59.740
If you charge to borrow the use of a service,
82

82

00:04:59.740  -->  00:05:03.210
you can charge less, but more often, and for longer.
83

83

00:05:03.210  -->  00:05:06.310
If I buy Photoshop, I just pay once, and I'm done with it.
84

84

00:05:06.310  -->  00:05:11.300
Now, to offset that, they might have to make the price really high to get
85

85

00:05:11.300  -->  00:05:14.690
the same amount of revenue, and that ends up discouraging people from testing it out.
86

86

00:05:14.690  -->  00:05:17.360
Another advantage is that you can access your files
87

87

00:05:17.360  -->  00:05:20.660
and these tools anywhere you have an internet connection.
88

88

00:05:20.660  -->  00:05:24.600
That means if you don't have the same computer, it's not really a big deal.
89

89

00:05:24.600  -->  00:05:29.470
If you write a paper in Microsoft Word, and you 
need to access it later from, say, your phone,
90

90

00:05:29.470  -->  00:05:33.840
but it's on your computer hard drive, well, there's nothing you can really do,
91

91

00:05:33.840  -->  00:05:38.310
but if you use Google Docs, you can access 
it through your browser pretty much anywhere.
92

92

00:05:38.310  -->  00:05:41.910
The last benefit we already mentioned is continuous updating.
93

93

00:05:41.910  -->  00:05:45.980
No waiting for your users to finally update their system manually,
94

94

00:05:45.980  -->  00:05:48.320
you could just make the changes yourself,
95

95

00:05:48.320  -->  00:05:51.360
and when they login, voila, the changes have happened.
96

96

00:05:51.360  -->  00:05:52.360
Ok, so that's Saas.
97

97

00:05:52.360  -->  00:05:56.590
It's a new way of delivering software that relies on the world's increasing
98

98

00:05:56.590  -->  00:06:01.060
connection to the internet to deliver a more valuable, accessible,
99

99

00:06:01.060  -->  00:06:04.430
and profitable experience to both the user and the business.
100

100

00:06:04.430  -->  00:06:08.810
Ok, so if that is Saas, then what is Paas?
101

101

00:06:08.810  -->  00:06:12.510
PaaS, on the other hand, stands for Platform as a Service,
102

102

00:06:12.510  -->  00:06:15.750
and of the three concepts, this is actually the youngest.
103

103

00:06:15.750  -->  00:06:20.180
Now, platform is a vague and loose term, I will admit this,
104

104

00:06:20.180  -->  00:06:24.480
and you're going to have to get used to this term being thrown around a lot,
105

105

00:06:24.480  -->  00:06:29.480
and at times correctly, or at times in just a way that doesn't even make sense.
106

106

00:06:29.480  -->  00:06:32.940
In this case, platform just means a set of tools, resources,
107

107

00:06:32.940  -->  00:06:37.740
and software that come together to let you build software on top of it.
108

108

00:06:37.740  -->  00:06:41.410
For example, when Facebook first started out, it was not a platform.
109

109

00:06:41.410  -->  00:06:44.900
You could message people, you could post photos, you could lie
110

110

00:06:44.900  -->  00:06:47.850
about your sister's baby photo and say that the baby is cute,
111

111

00:06:47.850  -->  00:06:50.810
even though it looks kind of like an alien or a squished melon,
112

112

00:06:50.810  -->  00:06:57.320
but it wasn't until - you can kind of guess this - that Facebook started letting you create -
113

113

00:06:57.320  -->  00:07:01.280
- well, actually it was video games - Facebook started letting you create your own games
114

114

00:07:01.280  -->  00:07:05.830
that could be accessed through Facebook, and at that point it became a platform.
115

115

00:07:05.830  -->  00:07:09.970
Slack, I don't know if you guys have used that, but it's just a fancy chat room,
116

116

00:07:09.970  -->  00:07:14.350
and was just a fancy chat room until they opened up their system whereby you could
117

117

00:07:14.350  -->  00:07:19.480
create apps that ran inside of Slack, mostly bots, unfortunately.
118

118

00:07:19.480  -->  00:07:22.520
At that point, after the bots came, that's when it became a platform.
119

119

00:07:22.520  -->  00:07:27.320
So in this sense, PaaS is designed from the get go to assist you in building software.
120

120

00:07:27.320  -->  00:07:31.760
Think of it like this - if you were going to build an application locally and not in the cloud,
121

121

00:07:31.760  -->  00:07:35.430
you would need to pick a language, a system for running and interpreting that language,
122

122

00:07:35.430  -->  00:07:39.630
an IDE potentially, a database system, a web server,
123

123

00:07:39.630  -->  00:07:43.170
a system for managing frameworks and libraries, etc.
124

124

00:07:43.170  -->  00:07:46.500
You'd need to pull together a bunch of tools and resources.
125

125

00:07:46.500  -->  00:07:50.210
Now, PaaS, on the other hand, is the cloud equivalent of all of that.
126

126

00:07:50.210  -->  00:07:54.790
Amazon Web Services, or often referred to just as AWS,
127

127

00:07:54.790  -->  00:07:58.320
is a set of tools that can help you build applications.
128

128

00:07:58.320  -->  00:08:03.360
Microsoft Azure is another example, and it's just a bundle of tools, such as
129

129

00:08:03.360  -->  00:08:08.290
the .NET framework, Microsoft SQL, and a thing called Live Services,
130

130

00:08:08.290  -->  00:08:12.500
you can use all those together to build applications, save yourself time from
131

131

00:08:12.500  -->  00:08:16.940
having to assemble the odd hodge-podge of tools that you need.
132

132

00:08:16.940  -->  00:08:20.720
In these scenarios, they take all the tools that you need to develop applications
133

133

00:08:20.720  -->  00:08:23.880
and deliver them in one nice little package with a bow on it.
134

134

00:08:23.880  -->  00:08:29.370
If you guys ever heard of Heroku, that's another popular example of a PaaS system.
135

135

00:08:29.370  -->  00:08:33.000
So instead of building it the old way, you might login to Heroku
136

136

00:08:33.000  -->  00:08:36.120
and build your application there, since everything is already set up
137

137

00:08:36.120  -->  00:08:38.290
and served to you essentially on a silver dish.
138

138

00:08:38.290  -->  00:08:42.550
And if you were wondering, yes, you can build SaaS on a PaaS,
139

139

00:08:42.550  -->  00:08:47.770
in fact, that's actually what happens the most, so think of it like a stack.
140

140

00:08:47.770  -->  00:08:50.800
You have SaaS on top, you have PaaS in the middle,
141

141

00:08:50.800  -->  00:08:52.900
since the PaaS helps you build the SaaS,
142

142

00:08:52.900  -->  00:08:56.940
and the SaaS operates technically within that platform,
143

143

00:08:56.940  -->  00:09:02.310
and at the bottom is the last of our topic area, that is IaaS.
144

144

00:09:02.310  -->  00:09:05.250
Now this acronym that I cannot pronounce to save my life,
145

145

00:09:05.250  -->  00:09:07.010
I don't know if anybody knows how to pronounce it,
146

146

00:09:07.010  -->  00:09:09.450
it stands for Infrastructure as a Service.
147

147

00:09:09.450  -->  00:09:14.150
Infrastructure as in what holds up and contains whatever it is that you're building.
148

148

00:09:14.150  -->  00:09:19.230
90% of the time what we're referring to when we say IaaS is web storage.
149

149

00:09:19.230  -->  00:09:24.100
Now, Amazon Web Services, IaaS, is a set of tools for putting together an app,
150

150

00:09:24.100  -->  00:09:28.810
and is considered a platform as a service, but within that set of tools,
151

151

00:09:28.810  -->  00:09:32.940
they offer a storage service, which is called Amazon EC2.
152

152

00:09:32.940  -->  00:09:35.380
That is infrastructure as a service.
153

153

00:09:35.380  -->  00:09:40.290
That's the 90% of it, they give you virtual web servers to run your application on.
154

154

00:09:40.290  -->  00:09:43.550
The other 10% we're leaving out are tools and maintenance
155

155

00:09:43.550  -->  00:09:47.530
that make the offering of servers a little more robust.
156

156

00:09:47.530  -->  00:09:50.750
Infrastructure as a service systems typically will offer things like
157

157

00:09:50.750  -->  00:09:54.580
security and firewalling, they'll do routing and network services,
158

158

00:09:54.580  -->  00:09:58.130
and they'll do things like maintenance and load balancing for free.
159

159

00:09:58.130  -->  00:10:02.100
It's pretty cool actually, and that's what the EC in EC2 stands for,
160

160

00:10:02.100  -->  00:10:06.550
it's Elastic Cloud, as in "I wonder how much storage space and server speed
161

161

00:10:06.550  -->  00:10:12.980
I'll need for my site, I'm expecting 200 visitors a day, and oops, I just got 10,000."
162

162

00:10:12.980  -->  00:10:16.920
In a normal scenario, your web server would crash, but with EC2,
163

163

00:10:16.920  -->  00:10:21.880
it can actually pick up on that and temporarily 
give you more resources so you don't go offline.
164

164

00:10:21.880  -->  00:10:25.660
If you set up your own server, it would be kind of hard to figure that out.
165

165

00:10:25.660  -->  00:10:29.920
Ok, wow, that was kind of a doozy. Let's recap this.
166

166

00:10:29.920  -->  00:10:35.340
SaaS is Software as a Service, most often seen as a web version of a software
167

167

00:10:35.340  -->  00:10:40.400
that you have to pay monthly to use, but it can be in all sorts of different configurations,
168

168

00:10:40.400  -->  00:10:44.180
as we've learned with Adobe Creative Cloud -
169

169

00:10:44.180  -->  00:10:47.580
Adobe Creative Cloud, which owns Adobe Photoshop.
170

170

00:10:47.580  -->  00:10:52.420
Platform as a Service, or PaaS, is an online set of tools that will help you speed up
171

171

00:10:52.420  -->  00:10:56.220
and facilitate the process of creating applications, and it often includes
172

172

00:10:56.220  -->  00:11:01.530
Infrastructure as a Service, which is generally subscription services to web storage,
173

173

00:11:01.530  -->  00:11:04.670
and other useful things like load balancing and security maintenance.
174

174

00:11:04.670  -->  00:11:10.110
All right, wow, that was a long lecture, I apologize 
for that in advance if you're watching this,
175

175

00:11:10.110  -->  00:11:16.750
I suggest going outside and stretching, or doing 
something else, I don't know, just take a break.
176

176

00:11:16.750  -->  00:11:18.910
In the meantime, I'll see you in the next lecture!
