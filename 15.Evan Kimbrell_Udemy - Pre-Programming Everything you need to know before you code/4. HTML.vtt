00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.340
All right guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.340  -->  00:00:05.180
Let's get acquainted with HTML.
3

3

00:00:05.180  -->  00:00:06.930
What is HTML?
4

4

00:00:06.930  -->  00:00:13.620
Well, contrary to HBO's show Silicon Valley, 
it does not stand for How To Meet Ladies,
5

5

00:00:13.620  -->  00:00:17.280
which ironically could not be farther from the truth.
6

6

00:00:17.280  -->  00:00:21.030
What it does stand for is HyperText Markup Language.
7

7

00:00:21.030  -->  00:00:22.960
Let's have a history lesson, shall we?
8

8

00:00:22.960  -->  00:00:27.870
And interestingly enough, that phrase, HyperText Markup Language,
9

9

00:00:27.870  -->  00:00:33.040
it actually tells us a lot about where this language came from
10

10

00:00:33.040  -->  00:00:35.870
and what it was when it was originally made.
11

11

00:00:35.870  -->  00:00:38.630
Remember how when we talked 
about how the internet originally started,
12

12

00:00:38.630  -->  00:00:41.460
we said that at the very beginning, it was primarily
13

13

00:00:41.460  -->  00:00:45.320
used in academia for sharing research and information.
14

14

00:00:45.320  -->  00:00:48.480
That's actually where HTML originally came from.
15

15

00:00:48.480  -->  00:00:52.920
Transferring text for research worked great, until it didn't,
16

16

00:00:52.920  -->  00:00:57.230
and people started looking for ways of 
increasing the efficiency of sharing research.
17

17

00:00:57.230  -->  00:01:00.380
The first effort to do this was to create a technology
18

18

00:01:00.380  -->  00:01:04.500
we learned about before, called HyperText Transfer Protocol.
19

19

00:01:04.500  -->  00:01:09.740
Remember, that's the HTTP you put in your 
browser every single time you go to a website.
20

20

00:01:09.740  -->  00:01:13.680
The idea was that with this protocol people could then use HyperLinks
21

21

00:01:13.680  -->  00:01:18.350
and easily embed within documents links to other documents.
22

22

00:01:18.350  -->  00:01:24.180
Raise your hand if you thought that 
the official term for links was "links."
23

23

00:01:24.180  -->  00:01:26.930
You're wrong, it's actually HyperLinks.
24

24

00:01:26.930  -->  00:01:30.990
"Hyper" in this case just refers to the fact that, back in time,
25

25

00:01:30.990  -->  00:01:35.570
when they created this, people actually 
thought it was extra or special.
26

26

00:01:35.570  -->  00:01:37.180
Remember, this was a while ago.
27

27

00:01:37.180  -->  00:01:40.740
Once researchers used these and figured 
out how to link to other documents,
28

28

00:01:40.740  -->  00:01:45.580
the next thing they needed to satisfy 
was their overwhelming craving to markup
29

29

00:01:45.580  -->  00:01:50.250
text they were given with highlights, 
and underlining, formatting, bolding,
30

30

00:01:50.250  -->  00:01:54.020
and, you know, the big red marker 
that says F with a circle around it.
31

31

00:01:54.020  -->  00:02:00.260
And from the technology that was used to create 
HyperLinks, we had an extension which became HTML.
32

32

00:02:00.260  -->  00:02:06.100
Yes, wow, now go and amaze your friends 
with that amazing piece of information.
33

33

00:02:06.100  -->  00:02:08.630
But why exactly is that helpful to know?
34

34

00:02:08.630  -->  00:02:14.500
Well, first off, you need to understand that HTML 
is by far the simplest web language you can learn
35

35

00:02:14.500  -->  00:02:18.000
and it's included in virtually every single website out there.
36

36

00:02:18.000  -->  00:02:21.480
You can learn it, I'd say, easily within 2-3 days.
37

37

00:02:21.480  -->  00:02:26.750
If you had to sum up what HTML does, 
it's exactly what we just learned from that story.
38

38

00:02:26.750  -->  00:02:31.390
It's used as the language to insert text, insert an image, a table,
39

39

00:02:31.390  -->  00:02:35.330
a link, a button, and then assign attributes to that object.
40

40

00:02:35.330  -->  00:02:40.230
If I typed out "I will give Evan five stars for this course,"
41

41

00:02:40.230  -->  00:02:46.030
I could use what's called an HTML tag 
around that text and that tag
42

42

00:02:46.030  -->  00:02:49.540
would make it underlined just by putting the little alligator,
43

43

00:02:49.540  -->  00:02:51.480
then a "u," then the other alligator.
44

44

00:02:51.480  -->  00:02:54.880
Then I'd have to close it off by putting yet another alligator
45

45

00:02:54.880  -->  00:02:59.620
with a "u" but this time with a slash in front of it, which designates that
46

46

00:02:59.620  -->  00:03:02.450
I'm ending the request to underline this text.
47

47

00:03:02.450  -->  00:03:06.800
Anything in between these two 
special characters should be underlined.
48

48

00:03:06.800  -->  00:03:10.540
So that's one tag you can use in HTML, and guess what?
49

49

00:03:10.540  -->  00:03:15.470
There's only roughly about 142 different tags you can add.
50

50

00:03:15.470  -->  00:03:19.060
You know, one took four seconds, so 
how long could it take to learn the rest?
51

51

00:03:19.060  -->  00:03:25.610
If I wanted to say on the screen "How do you do" 
in huge font with a line break in between the middle,
52

52

00:03:25.610  -->  00:03:34.920
I would put inside those alligators "h1," which means header, 
basically it says what the size of the font should be,
53

53

00:03:34.920  -->  00:03:39.550
then I type "How do", and then I put "br" inside of two alligators,
54

54

00:03:39.550  -->  00:03:42.760
"br" for line break, that's what it tells it to do,
55

55

00:03:42.760  -->  00:03:48.160
then "you do", then I close it out by 
putting "h1" inside the alligator brackets,
56

56

00:03:48.160  -->  00:03:51.860
but this time with a slash in front of it, saying this is the end
57

57

00:03:51.860  -->  00:03:56.340
of the text that we should make the size of what's called header 1.
58

58

00:03:56.340  -->  00:04:01.040
So that's it. Add something to the page, and 
then use tags to modify the way it displays.
59

59

00:04:01.040  -->  00:04:04.850
You can use this to create lists, create form input fields,
60

60

00:04:04.850  -->  00:04:09.450
put header text on the screen, format a paragraph, you could
61

61

00:04:09.450  -->  00:04:13.630
break up a paragraph, anything you 
could probably do in a word processor.
62

62

00:04:13.630  -->  00:04:16.860
Since HTML was made for marking up research papers,
63

63

00:04:16.860  -->  00:04:22.800
it has for the most part stayed that way, 
and hence why it's the easiest language to learn.
64

64

00:04:22.800  -->  00:04:27.720
True story, when I was 11 years old, 
I started selling things on Ebay,
65

65

00:04:27.720  -->  00:04:34.480
and my secret was that I could use HTML 
to make my Ebay pages have fancy colors,
66

66

00:04:34.480  -->  00:04:42.410
or display rainbows, or funny images, or 
text that vibrates and shines, and all that stuff.
67

67

00:04:42.410  -->  00:04:44.820
Now, that's the perfect example of what to use HTML for.
68

68

00:04:44.820  -->  00:04:47.730
Hey, it's a big block of text, how can I make this block of text
69

69

00:04:47.730  -->  00:04:50.140
look like something other than a block of text?
70

70

00:04:50.140  -->  00:04:55.100
For the sticklers out there, it's worth 
pointing out that HTML is not technically
71

71

00:04:55.100  -->  00:05:00.500
considered a programming language, 
because it doesn't really give or allow you
72

72

00:05:00.500  -->  00:05:05.650
to create complex instructions, really 
what it allows you to do is the same stuff
73

73

00:05:05.650  -->  00:05:07.980
you could do in what's called a Rich Text Editor.
74

74

00:05:07.980  -->  00:05:11.080
You know when you're writing a comment on a box,
75

75

00:05:11.080  -->  00:05:15.120
say you're writing an angry comment 
on YouTube, it should give you
76

76

00:05:15.120  -->  00:05:20.530
the ability to add bold, or underline, 
or just change the size of the font.
77

77

00:05:20.530  -->  00:05:24.890
That there basically summarizes HTML - the function,
78

78

00:05:24.890  -->  00:05:26.570
not what you're actually saying in the comment.
79

79

00:05:26.570  -->  00:05:30.400
Now, keep in mind, HTML has come a long, long way.
80

80

00:05:30.400  -->  00:05:37.180
We're currently using HTML5, which has 
quite a few new increased capabilities.
81

81

00:05:37.180  -->  00:05:41.210
Now, the new version of HTML is way different than the original,
82

82

00:05:41.210  -->  00:05:45.840
and this new version is designed to let you 
embed pretty much anything you want into a page,
83

83

00:05:45.840  -->  00:05:48.520
like music, videos, and even games.
84

84

00:05:48.520  -->  00:05:51.650
This is something that the original 
HTML never even dreamed of doing.
85

85

00:05:51.650  -->  00:05:56.090
In the in-between years between HTML original and HTML5,
86

86

00:05:56.090  -->  00:06:01.580
we actually saw a whole lot of different things coming to the language,
87

87

00:06:01.580  -->  00:06:04.600
and we saw that the language can do some crazy stuff.
88

88

00:06:04.600  -->  00:06:08.260
One thing, for example, that HTML learned how to do was
89

89

00:06:08.260  -->  00:06:13.270
how to pull code into the page that it's in, or the document,
90

90

00:06:13.270  -->  00:06:17.680
from other documents that are on the same web server.
91

91

00:06:17.680  -->  00:06:22.800
Now, this concept of pulling code or including 
it is something that's crucial to understand
92

92

00:06:22.800  -->  00:06:27.020
if you ever do decide to go on and learn 
the next language we're going to talk about,
93

93

00:06:27.020  -->  00:06:30.420
which is CSS, because without that ability to include code
94

94

00:06:30.420  -->  00:06:33.360
within the main code that's being displayed on the browser,
95

95

00:06:33.360  -->  00:06:35.660
CSS wouldn't exactly have a point.
96

96

00:06:35.660  -->  00:06:37.070
All right, that's a sufficient cliffhanger.
97

97

00:06:37.070  -->  00:06:38.790
I'll see you guys in the next lecture!
