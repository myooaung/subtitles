00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,940
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:01,940  -->  00:00:04,250
This lecture, we're going to talk about another tech trend,
3

3

00:00:04,250  -->  00:00:08,010
and something you really need to know about, it's called SWIFT.
4

4

00:00:08,010  -->  00:00:12,800
Now, what SWIFT is is a relatively new programming language
5

5

00:00:12,800  -->  00:00:18,360
that was designed by Apple specifically for their operating systems.
6

6

00:00:18,360  -->  00:00:24,500
Now, originally, if you wanted to make something for iOS, say, like, make a mobile app,
7

7

00:00:24,500  -->  00:00:27,500
you'd have to make it in a language called Objective C.
8

8

00:00:27,500  -->  00:00:29,860
That was pretty much the way that it worked ever since
9

9

00:00:29,860  -->  00:00:33,060
the iPhone came out in, like, what was it, 2004?
10

10

00:00:33,060  -->  00:00:36,980
But the problem with Objective C, if you remember 
from way back in the first couple of sections,
11

11

00:00:36,980  -->  00:00:42,250
is that it's a low level language, which means that it's typically harder to learn,
12

12

00:00:42,250  -->  00:00:46,280
it's often very strict, and it has a lot of constraints.
13

13

00:00:46,280  -->  00:00:50,380
So Apple said, "Well, why don't we just make a new programming language
14

14

00:00:50,380  -->  00:00:56,590
that's easier to learn and allows you to cut out a lot of the redundancies and code faster?"
15

15

00:00:56,590  -->  00:01:01,670
And so Apple envisioned this bird like logo for their programming language,
16

16

00:01:01,670  -->  00:01:05,700
and like Apple, they tried to make it fun and trendy.
17

17

00:01:05,700  -->  00:01:08,140
So right now, we're kind of experiencing a shift.
18

18

00:01:08,140  -->  00:01:14,480
Most iOS developers know Objective C and a lot of them are making the decision
19

19

00:01:14,480  -->  00:01:20,220
whether or not to learn SWIFT, because you can make an app in either currently.
20

20

00:01:20,220  -->  00:01:24,220
At the same time, people who are learning how to make mobile apps are deciding,
21

21

00:01:24,220  -->  00:01:27,160
"Do I learn SWIFT or do I learn Objective C?"
22

22

00:01:27,160  -->  00:01:29,470
Now, there are some upsides and downsides to SWIFT.
23

23

00:01:29,470  -->  00:01:33,020
The upsides, and it's kind of odd, but this is how they sell it,
24

24

00:01:33,020  -->  00:01:37,680
is that it's a safer language to use, and they mean safe by
25

25

00:01:37,680  -->  00:01:41,200
it's easier to recover from mistakes you make in your code,
26

26

00:01:41,200  -->  00:01:43,640
they even give you this system called playground,
27

27

00:01:43,640  -->  00:01:46,980
which is kind of just a development environment
28

28

00:01:46,980  -->  00:01:49,810
where you can test out your apps beforehand.
29

29

00:01:49,810  -->  00:01:51,900
Now, most people who've made mobile apps before know that
30

30

00:01:51,900  -->  00:01:55,350
there's plenty of tools out there that do something similarly,
31

31

00:01:55,350  -->  00:01:58,160
but SWIFT is the first one I guess to integrate it.
32

32

00:01:58,160  -->  00:02:01,290
They also sell it as something that's fun.
33

33

00:02:01,290  -->  00:02:05,060
I'm assuming that it's fun because it's faster, they've found
34

34

00:02:05,060  -->  00:02:10,680
ways to remove a lot of the repetitive work that goes into making apps.
35

35

00:02:10,680  -->  00:02:14,000
Now, there are three things I think you should know about SWIFT,
36

36

00:02:14,000  -->  00:02:16,810
regardless of whether or not you're going to go into mobile development.
37

37

00:02:16,810  -->  00:02:20,580
The first is don't think of SWIFT as just something for iOS.
38

38

00:02:20,580  -->  00:02:25,820
iOS has sister operating systems, and SWIFT is actually designed to work on all of them.
39

39

00:02:25,820  -->  00:02:31,980
There's OS X, as in your laptop or your desktop, there's Watch OS, Apple Watch,
40

40

00:02:31,980  -->  00:02:34,620
and there's even TV OS, for the Apple TV.
41

41

00:02:34,620  -->  00:02:36,430
So SWIFT works on all four of these.
42

42

00:02:36,430  -->  00:02:38,930
Another thing I want you to come away with is that Apple is doing this
43

43

00:02:38,930  -->  00:02:43,280
because they want to accelerate the developer community
44

44

00:02:43,280  -->  00:02:46,770
in the developer platform for their system.
45

45

00:02:46,770  -->  00:02:50,410
In general, you see this happen a lot, if you are building a platform,
46

46

00:02:50,410  -->  00:02:54,910
lots of people are participating, but they're hamstrung, or they're kind of being impeded
47

47

00:02:54,910  -->  00:02:58,100
by old technology, a lot of times the company will just
48

48

00:02:58,100  -->  00:03:01,290
take it upon themselves to create a new technology.
49

49

00:03:01,290  -->  00:03:05,760
The last thing I want to point out is that SWIFT is supposedly really easy to learn,
50

50

00:03:05,760  -->  00:03:11,750
but if you actually get into it, I would suggest researching it beforehand,
51

51

00:03:11,750  -->  00:03:15,700
because from what I've been able to tell, what most people say is that actually
52

52

00:03:15,700  -->  00:03:20,270
if you don't have experience in Objective C, learning SWIFT can be pretty difficult.
53

53

00:03:20,270  -->  00:03:23,220
So it was supposed to be a much better version of Objective C,
54

54

00:03:23,220  -->  00:03:27,750
but in reality, it was more or less built as an extension of it.
55

55

00:03:27,750  -->  00:03:31,220
All right guys, that's SWIFT, it's Apple's new toy,
56

56

00:03:31,220  -->  00:03:33,700
everybody is trying to decide whether or not to learn SWIFT
57

57

00:03:33,700  -->  00:03:36,950
or stick with the tried and true Objective C to make things
58

58

00:03:36,950  -->  00:03:42,460
for OS X, iOS, and the Watch, and TV operating systems.
59

59

00:03:42,460  -->  00:03:43,950
All right, see you in the next lecture!
