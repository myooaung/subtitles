00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.130
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.130  -->  00:00:05.070
All right, so in this lecture we're 
going to break down the browser,
3

3

00:00:05.070  -->  00:00:10.440
what it is, what it does, and what you need 
to know about it to get up to speed.
4

4

00:00:10.440  -->  00:00:15.280
Do you happen to know what a browser 
already does and do you also already
5

5

00:00:15.280  -->  00:00:18.300
happen to have an obnoxiously strong opinion about Internet Explorer?
6

6

00:00:18.300  -->  00:00:22.590
Well, in that case, skip this lecture, otherwise, let's move forward.
7

7

00:00:22.590  -->  00:00:25.590
Ok, you know what I mean by a browser, right?
8

8

00:00:25.590  -->  00:00:28.920
It's that thing you're probably watching this on right now.
9

9

00:00:28.920  -->  00:00:31.630
The way we think of them today is that they're portals to the web
10

10

00:00:31.630  -->  00:00:36.760
and chock full of rich features and extensions, 
extensions so rich and decadent
11

11

00:00:36.760  -->  00:00:40.940
they freeze your browser - seriously, Chrome, I don't understand why.
12

12

00:00:40.940  -->  00:00:43.870
Want some more trite and unoriginal descriptions of browsers?
13

13

00:00:43.870  -->  00:00:45.780
Well, I'm here to service you.
14

14

00:00:45.780  -->  00:00:47.150
Door to the internet.
15

15

00:00:47.150  -->  00:00:48.820
The surfboard for your surfing.
16

16

00:00:48.820  -->  00:00:51.120
The gateway to memes.
17

17

00:00:51.120  -->  00:00:53.920
How you read your Gmail.
18

18

00:00:53.920  -->  00:00:54.730
Yeah, that's about it.
19

19

00:00:54.730  -->  00:00:56.890
All right, let's get into some actual details.
20

20

00:00:56.890  -->  00:01:00.260
What is a browser? Well, let's break it down.
21

21

00:01:00.260  -->  00:01:06.200
Browsers are like any other software program, 
and that's the first thing you need to understand.
22

22

00:01:06.200  -->  00:01:08.530
Anyone with a decent level of programming knowledge
23

23

00:01:08.530  -->  00:01:12.170
can make an actual attempt at building a browser.
24

24

00:01:12.170  -->  00:01:15.740
Remember when we talked about the 
World Wide Web and why it was such a big deal?
25

25

00:01:15.740  -->  00:01:20.250
Well, remember? It's because what they did 
was they standardized the way that
26

26

00:01:20.250  -->  00:01:22.580
computers access information from each other.
27

27

00:01:22.580  -->  00:01:24.940
Previously, in order to communicate, they had to have
28

28

00:01:24.940  -->  00:01:27.730
the exact same software and the exact same hardware.
29

29

00:01:27.730  -->  00:01:32.290
The internet browser is just a logical extension to that.
30

30

00:01:32.290  -->  00:01:36.230
World Wide Web made this information uniform. Great.
31

31

00:01:36.230  -->  00:01:39.060
How do we access it? That's what a browser is.
32

32

00:01:39.060  -->  00:01:43.940
Really, you just need to think of a browser like 
a software program that has two basic functions.
33

33

00:01:43.940  -->  00:01:48.410
The first function is that it can establish 
a persistent connection with the server
34

34

00:01:48.410  -->  00:01:52.520
where you can access files to view the 
website you want to view. Awesome.
35

35

00:01:52.520  -->  00:01:56.800
The second function is that it can 
translate web programming into something
36

36

00:01:56.800  -->  00:01:59.590
your operating system can actually understand.
37

37

00:01:59.590  -->  00:02:04.850
Later on in the course, we're going to talk about 
the actual nitty gritty of programming and code,
38

38

00:02:04.850  -->  00:02:08.920
but for now you just need to understand 
that when programmers program,
39

39

00:02:08.920  -->  00:02:13.940
they're essentially just writing instructions 
for a computer to execute and handle.
40

40

00:02:13.940  -->  00:02:17.240
In order to manipulate a browser into 
displaying something beautiful and pretty,
41

41

00:02:17.240  -->  00:02:21.180
or ugly and clunky like the website you're on (don't tell Udemy),
42

42

00:02:21.180  -->  00:02:24.310
they have to use web code. Why web code?
43

43

00:02:24.310  -->  00:02:27.720
Well, don't worry about it right now, we'll get to it later.
44

44

00:02:27.720  -->  00:02:31.850
So your browser is just an interpreter for a very specific language.
45

45

00:02:31.850  -->  00:02:36.570
It takes that very specific language, translates it to
46

46

00:02:36.570  -->  00:02:40.680
something your operating system 
can understand, which then in turn
47

47

00:02:40.680  -->  00:02:44.560
translates it down to machine code, 
that the hardware can act on.
48

48

00:02:44.560  -->  00:02:47.400
And that is how you see a change on your screen.
49

49

00:02:47.400  -->  00:02:51.240
So how does this new understanding and 
way of thinking affect the browsers we use?
50

50

00:02:51.240  -->  00:02:57.050
Well, for one, there are, believe it or not, 
several hundred browsers out there.
51

51

00:02:57.050  -->  00:03:00.580
Most of you have probably only heard 
of maybe four or five of them.
52

52

00:03:00.580  -->  00:03:05.180
The most commonly used ones, in order of popularity, start with
53

53

00:03:05.180  -->  00:03:09.420
one, the most popular, the king Google 
Chrome, then two, Mozilla Firefox,
54

54

00:03:09.420  -->  00:03:12.820
three, Internet Explorer, which actually just changed its name to
55

55

00:03:12.820  -->  00:03:17.440
something that I will never speak, 
four, Safari, and five, Opera.
56

56

00:03:17.440  -->  00:03:21.840
Since all of these are actually just versions 
of the same interpreting service,
57

57

00:03:21.840  -->  00:03:26.400
are they any different and how 
do we actually distinguish between them?
58

58

00:03:26.400  -->  00:03:31.510
Well, believe it or not, every browser 
has a different way of interpreting web code,
59

59

00:03:31.510  -->  00:03:35.620
and hence, if you've ever switched browsers 
and looked at the same website,
60

60

00:03:35.620  -->  00:03:40.260
if you really look closely, you'll notice that 
it may actually look quite a bit different.
61

61

00:03:40.260  -->  00:03:43.320
Think of it kind of like verbal language translations.
62

62

00:03:43.320  -->  00:03:46.150
There is always different ways of interpreting a sentence,
63

63

00:03:46.150  -->  00:03:49.690
and one of them is probably more or less correct than another,
64

64

00:03:49.690  -->  00:03:52.700
but you can certainly give it multiple translations.
65

65

00:03:52.700  -->  00:03:56.040
If you want to have some fun, 
actually you can stop and go do this.
66

66

00:03:56.040  -->  00:04:03.840
Go to Google Translate and type something in English, 
and then have it translate to Vietnamese,
67

67

00:04:03.840  -->  00:04:07.530
and then translate it to Spanish, and then back to English.
68

68

00:04:07.530  -->  00:04:11.880
It comes back as the most garbled nonsense you have ever read.
69

69

00:04:11.880  -->  00:04:13.530
I blame it on the Vietnamese.
70

70

00:04:13.530  -->  00:04:16.450
Ok, so each browser interprets the same website differently.
71

71

00:04:16.450  -->  00:04:18.360
What does that mean to me and us?
72

72

00:04:18.360  -->  00:04:22.990
That means, well, if you get into web development 
or you manage a team of web developers,
73

73

00:04:22.990  -->  00:04:27.400
* Anybody can herd cattle, hold them together, 
but ten thousand half-wild short hairs,
74

74

00:04:27.400  -->  00:04:29.580
now that's another thing altogether *
75

75

00:04:29.580  -->  00:04:33.520
you're probably going to spend a 
significant amount of time making sure the site
76

76

00:04:33.520  -->  00:04:37.840
you've spent so much time building 
correctly loads in every single browser.
77

77

00:04:37.840  -->  00:04:40.780
Opera, that browser you've probably 
never heard of, is technically
78

78

00:04:40.780  -->  00:04:47.130
the most accurate interpreter, but no one really cares, 
because they all use Google Chrome,
79

79

00:04:47.130  -->  00:04:50.130
and they like its look, and feel, and its crazy extensions,
80

80

00:04:50.130  -->  00:04:54.290
or maybe they love the absolute level of customization of Firefox,
81

81

00:04:54.290  -->  00:04:57.970
or maybe they're just a terrible person 
and that's why they use Internet Explorer.
82

82

00:04:57.970  -->  00:05:04.640
I'm obviously kidding about that last one, but it is 
considered to be the least accurate of the five,
83

83

00:05:04.640  -->  00:05:09.510
and almost any web developer will have a 
very strong opinion about Internet Explorer.
84

84

00:05:09.510  -->  00:05:12.410
This is simply a reality of how the web works.
85

85

00:05:12.410  -->  00:05:15.750
Next time you're talking to a web 
developer, casual conversation,
86

86

00:05:15.750  -->  00:05:17.950
ask how they feel about Internet Explorer.
87

87

00:05:17.950  -->  00:05:24.160
Fun fact, Firefox, that browser you use with 
the little red fox on it, that is actually a non-profit.
88

88

00:05:24.160  -->  00:05:29.600
A non-profit that specifically makes, 
give or take, $300 million a year.
89

89

00:05:29.600  -->  00:05:33.340
How do they make $300 million a year?
90

90

00:05:33.340  -->  00:05:37.190
Well, I'll give you brownie points if you 
figure it out and you post in the Q&A.
91

91

00:05:37.190  -->  00:05:40.270
So browsers are one of those things that non-technical people
92

92

00:05:40.270  -->  00:05:44.970
probably think the least amount about, 
or probably just take for granted.
93

93

00:05:44.970  -->  00:05:49.020
How often do you honestly think about 
what your browser is actually doing?
94

94

00:05:49.020  -->  00:05:51.390
If I had to guess, I'd say probably never.
95

95

00:05:51.390  -->  00:05:56.320
But all you need to know is that it is, 
at its core function, an interpreter
96

96

00:05:56.320  -->  00:06:03.390
that knows how to display web code files, and it just 
packages that up in a convenient, easy to use way.
97

97

00:06:03.390  -->  00:06:06.500
Is this mind boggling? Maybe, maybe not.
98

98

00:06:06.500  -->  00:06:08.640
But you need to get into the mindset of thinking
99

99

00:06:08.640  -->  00:06:11.530
of your browser like that, like an interpreter,
100

100

00:06:11.530  -->  00:06:15.220
and guess what? If you're going 
to be programming in any way,
101

101

00:06:15.220  -->  00:06:20.450
you're going to need to make the browser 
your best friend and understand it really well.
102

102

00:06:20.450  -->  00:06:22.880
All right guys, that's all we need to talk about with browsers.
103

103

00:06:22.880  -->  00:06:24.160
See you in the next lecture!
