00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.400
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.400  -->  00:00:07.040
Ok, so we've rather pedantically defined what that dusty thing
3

3

00:00:07.040  -->  00:00:11.380
sitting on your desk is, what it does, 
and what makes it so special.
4

4

00:00:11.380  -->  00:00:17.910
It's called a computer and it uses a set of instruments, 
RAM, CPUs & hard drive storage
5

5

00:00:17.910  -->  00:00:20.520
to process information automatically.
6

6

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:27.860
It is basically a calculator on crack because 
it can calculate 3*3*3 like a billion times
7

7

00:00:27.860  -->  00:00:30.560
over and over again, and then change directions, and then decide,
8

8

00:00:30.560  -->  00:00:34.830
"Oh, I'm going to divide everything by 3, 
and 3, and then multiply it again.
9

9

00:00:34.830  -->  00:00:37.730
And trust me, this is actually something 
I have tried to do on a calculator
10

10

00:00:37.730  -->  00:00:43.040
during Stats class and alas, you cannot 
do it without breaking the calculator.
11

11

00:00:43.040  -->  00:00:47.910
Now, it does this with what we call machine code, 
that is exactly like the matrix
12

12

00:00:47.910  -->  00:00:52.740
and it just consists of 0s and 1s - electricity on, electricity off.
13

13

00:00:52.740  -->  00:00:57.200
Now, as hardware progressed, we started 
developing high level code
14

14

00:00:57.200  -->  00:01:00.690
that was much easier for dumb humans to read and write,
15

15

00:01:00.690  -->  00:01:03.090
and ultimately better manipulate our devices.
16

16

00:01:03.090  -->  00:01:06.500
But that alone doesn't really 
sound that special now, does it?
17

17

00:01:06.500  -->  00:01:12.300
With 0s and 1s it can calculate stuff and take 
information and direction from other sources,
18

18

00:01:12.300  -->  00:01:15.800
like, say, keyboards, mice, and iSmells.
19

19

00:01:15.800  -->  00:01:21.000
If you don't know what an iSmell is, actually 
look it up, just Google DigiScents iSmell,
20

20

00:01:21.000  -->  00:01:24.580
it's one of the worst inventions ever made, it's incredible.
21

21

00:01:24.580  -->  00:01:25.610
Anyway, back on track.
22

22

00:01:25.610  -->  00:01:28.480
So what really does make your computer special?
23

23

00:01:28.480  -->  00:01:33.320
Well, what really makes your computer special 
is what's called an operating system.
24

24

00:01:33.320  -->  00:01:36.930
Now, without operating systems 
we would not be taking this class
25

25

00:01:36.930  -->  00:01:41.800
and Bill Gates with his Erkil-like glasses 
and all would not be the richest
26

26

00:01:41.800  -->  00:01:45.970
person in the world, off curing diseases 
and answering questions on Reddit.
27

27

00:01:45.970  -->  00:01:50.070
You see, before operating systems, 
the only people using computers were
28

28

00:01:50.070  -->  00:01:53.940
highly technical people that could 
actually understand machine code.
29

29

00:01:57.090  -->  00:02:00.680
They were lab coated, worked out of universities primarily,
30

30

00:02:00.680  -->  00:02:03.790
and most importantly, there were very, very few of them.
31

31

00:02:03.790  -->  00:02:07.990
The innovation of the PC era 
- PC meaning personal computer,
32

32

00:02:07.990  -->  00:02:13.600
i.e. any computer you've actually ever 
used or touched - was to create a system
33

33

00:02:13.600  -->  00:02:18.440
whereby a relatively layman user 
could manipulate the computer
34

34

00:02:18.440  -->  00:02:20.700
in the same way a lab coated technician could.
35

35

00:02:20.700  -->  00:02:25.380
* Don't be jealous that I've been 
chatting online with babes, all day *
36

36

00:02:25.380  -->  00:02:30.450
That invention was the world's 
first software, a term used specifically
37

37

00:02:30.450  -->  00:02:34.220
to contrast with what we've 
learned already, which is hardware.
38

38

00:02:34.220  -->  00:02:38.920
Now, software is an application or 
a system of instructions and logic that
39

39

00:02:38.920  -->  00:02:44.390
exists within the actual hardware 
and is used to control the hardware.
40

40

00:02:44.390  -->  00:02:48.530
Before software, hardware was just... quite dumb.
41

41

00:02:48.530  -->  00:02:52.900
And so, enter the operating system, 
which at first looked not at all
42

42

00:02:52.900  -->  00:02:55.640
like the operating systems we use today.
43

43

00:02:55.640  -->  00:03:00.680
I'm not even 100% sure what 
the first ever operating system technically was,
44

44

00:03:00.680  -->  00:03:04.380
it probably has something to do with the thing called a BIOS,
45

45

00:03:04.380  -->  00:03:10.120
but the first one worth knowing and that caught 
on in the mainstream was called MS-DOS.
46

46

00:03:10.120  -->  00:03:13.990
And yes, I know, there were a couple more 
before this, but this was the first one that
47

47

00:03:13.990  -->  00:03:18.670
actually had millions of people use, or at least see.
48

48

00:03:18.670  -->  00:03:23.500
Now, the MS and MS-DOS, you can probably guess, 
it stands for Microsoft,
49

49

00:03:23.500  -->  00:03:29.840
and DOS is an attempt to sound kind of "future-y", 
and that meant Digital Operating System.
50

50

00:03:29.840  -->  00:03:35.780
MS-DOS was just a black screen that you could 
type commands into to do certain tasks.
51

51

00:03:35.780  -->  00:03:39.200
When you started up your computer, 
it would scream a bunch of jibberish at you,
52

52

00:03:39.200  -->  00:03:43.750
but eventually it would put up a blinking period, 
the universal sign for
53

53

00:03:43.750  -->  00:03:45.990
"I'm waiting for you to type something."
54

54

00:03:45.990  -->  00:03:50.460
A universal sign iMessage has since 
ruined and I will never forgive for.
55

55

00:03:50.460  -->  00:03:55.770
Now, in MS-DOS, you had to type in 
commands to do what you wanted to do.
56

56

00:03:55.770  -->  00:03:58.670
So if you wanted to, say, play a game like Minesweeper,
57

57

00:03:58.670  -->  00:04:03.170
you had to remember the command 
for calling up that program and opening it.
58

58

00:04:03.170  -->  00:04:08.540
You also had to remember where 
that program is stored on the computer,
59

59

00:04:08.540  -->  00:04:13.200
and if you got it wrong, MS-DOS was 
not going to help you out at all.
60

60

00:04:13.200  -->  00:04:16.190
It would just continue to taunt you with that flashing light.
61

61

00:04:16.190  -->  00:04:19.270
I used to spend hours trying to 
remember how to play this game where
62

62

00:04:19.270  -->  00:04:23.060
you moved blocks, and collected cheese, and trapped cats.
63

63

00:04:23.060  -->  00:04:27.760
If anyone actually remembers that one, 
post in the Q&A, we can reminisce.
64

64

00:04:27.760  -->  00:04:32.000
Anyway, that was the first operating system that got popular.
65

65

00:04:32.000  -->  00:04:38.010
Now, a relatively normal and relatively 
determined non-lab coated person
66

66

00:04:38.010  -->  00:04:42.000
could play Minesweeper on MS-DOS, or he could figure out
67

67

00:04:42.000  -->  00:04:44.210
how to make it do some math calculations.
68

68

00:04:44.210  -->  00:04:49.050
Now, what was happening behind this 
black screen and why was that so special?
69

69

00:04:49.050  -->  00:04:53.720
Well, it was taking your high level language 
instructions and translating it
70

70

00:04:53.720  -->  00:04:59.370
all the way down to the lowest level of beeps 
and boops that the hardware required to run.
71

71

00:04:59.370  -->  00:05:02.870
People who worked on MS-DOS 
would use an even higher level language
72

72

00:05:02.870  -->  00:05:06.900
to change and manipulate the 
operating system, like add functionality,
73

73

00:05:06.900  -->  00:05:11.610
maybe change a color or something. 
I don't know, there really wasn't much functionality to it.
74

74

00:05:11.610  -->  00:05:16.060
But keep in mind, just the core of the 
operating system in any operating system really
75

75

00:05:16.060  -->  00:05:22.650
is just a lightning quick interpreter. 
It interprets something you, the layman human,
76

76

00:05:22.650  -->  00:05:26.490
can use and speak to something the computer can understand.
77

77

00:05:26.490  -->  00:05:28.090
Ok, so let's just recap it.
78

78

00:05:28.090  -->  00:05:30.890
Operating systems are the reason why we use computers today.
79

79

00:05:30.890  -->  00:05:34.100
Because before them, not very many people could use them,
80

80

00:05:34.100  -->  00:05:37.000
and the number of things you would 
want to use them for were,
81

81

00:05:37.000  -->  00:05:39.400
well, very few and far between.
82

82

00:05:39.400  -->  00:05:41.670
Operating systems are a bit like steering wheels.
83

83

00:05:41.670  -->  00:05:45.920
If you have a steering wheel on your car, 
then you don't necessarily need to
84

84

00:05:45.920  -->  00:05:48.800
understand how exactly the engine works.
85

85

00:05:48.800  -->  00:05:51.750
Just know when it's broken and 
know when you're getting pulled over.
86

86

00:05:51.750  -->  00:05:55.220
The first operating system to get 
mass adoption was called MS-DOS,
87

87

00:05:55.220  -->  00:06:00.060
made by William Gates himself of Microsoft 
and large rimmed glasses fame.
88

88

00:06:00.060  -->  00:06:04.300
MS-DOS was just a black screen where you typed in commands,
89

89

00:06:04.300  -->  00:06:07.870
and it looks very similar to the program on Macs called Terminal.
90

90

00:06:07.870  -->  00:06:13.300
If you guys are on a Mac actually right now, 
just type into your spotlight "terminal",
91

91

00:06:13.300  -->  00:06:17.230
open that up and look at it, 
now you'll see exactly what I mean.
92

92

00:06:17.230  -->  00:06:19.180
It's basically miniature MS-DOS.
93

93

00:06:19.180  -->  00:06:22.380
Ok, next lecture, we're going to talk 
about how operating systems went
94

94

00:06:22.380  -->  00:06:28.520
from that dumb blinking light to that glossy 
over-animated piece of trash called Windows 10.
95

95

00:06:28.520  -->  00:06:32.490
Also, we're going to talk about how Steve Jobs originally got famous.
96

96

00:06:32.490  -->  00:06:33.800
All right guys, see you then!
