00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.730
All right guys, welcome back.
2

2

00:00:01.730  -->  00:00:05.870
Hopefully, I did not overwhelm you with 
what we covered in the last two lectures.
3

3

00:00:05.870  -->  00:00:10.270
To recap again, we just covered how 
the internet transfers information
4

4

00:00:10.270  -->  00:00:12.440
from one server to your computer.
5

5

00:00:12.440  -->  00:00:17.610
First it goes through an Internet Service Provider 
or an ISP, then through a local modem,
6

6

00:00:17.610  -->  00:00:20.750
then through a router, then to your computer or phone.
7

7

00:00:20.750  -->  00:00:24.190
Is there more to that process? 
Yes, absolutely.
8

8

00:00:24.190  -->  00:00:27.760
Do you need to know the rest? 
No, not really.
9

9

00:00:27.760  -->  00:00:30.800
You can learn that stuff on your own time, 
because we just want to
10

10

00:00:30.800  -->  00:00:34.300
get through the basics so that 
we can get to the actual good stuff.
11

11

00:00:34.300  -->  00:00:37.410
Ok, in this lecture we're going to cover 
yet three more concepts
12

12

00:00:37.410  -->  00:00:39.800
that are crucial to understanding how the internet works.
13

13

00:00:39.800  -->  00:00:42.770
I also knew that you were craving another three concepts.
14

14

00:00:42.770  -->  00:00:48.280
The first one is the concept of domain names, 
the second is the concept of IP addresses,
15

15

00:00:48.280  -->  00:00:51.180
and the last is a system called the DNS.
16

16

00:00:51.180  -->  00:00:53.390
Now, in the last lecture we just talked about the pathways
17

17

00:00:53.390  -->  00:00:56.390
information has to take to get to and from your device.
18

18

00:00:56.390  -->  00:01:03.560
But now let's talk about just how it is that 
when we type in www.hamsterdance.com
19

19

00:01:03.560  -->  00:01:06.300
it takes us to a page of dancing hamsters
20

20

00:01:14.370  -->  00:01:17.150
and not to a page of, let's say, knitting.
21

21

00:01:17.150  -->  00:01:20.750
If you're too young to remember hamsterdance, 
then I'm genuinely sorry.
22

22

00:01:20.750  -->  00:01:23.310
It was one of the joys of the early internet.
23

23

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:25.700
So when you open up your browser, 
and we've already covered
24

24

00:01:25.700  -->  00:01:30.000
what HTTP and WWW are, what happens?
25

25

00:01:30.000  -->  00:01:35.030
Well, to understand this, we have to understand 
what the concept of an IP address means.
26

26

00:01:35.030  -->  00:01:40.740
If you remember from an earlier lecture, 
IP stands for Internet Protocol
27

27

00:01:40.740  -->  00:01:46.870
and it's essentially a nine digit string of 
numbers stuck together with periods.
28

28

00:01:46.870  -->  00:01:49.130
Fascinating stuff, yes, I know.
29

29

00:01:49.130  -->  00:01:54.310
The easiest way to think about IP addresses is just 
to think of them like a bank routing number,
30

30

00:01:54.310  -->  00:01:57.810
you know, those numbers at the bottom of 
your checks that you don't write anymore,
31

31

00:01:57.810  -->  00:02:01.350
or even better yet, think of them like telephone numbers.
32

32

00:02:01.350  -->  00:02:04.360
This is going to be shocking to the younger crowd, 
but once upon a time
33

33

00:02:04.360  -->  00:02:08.970
we actually used to type in the number 
of the person we wanted to call,
34

34

00:02:08.970  -->  00:02:11.720
and that required that you memorized their number.
35

35

00:02:11.720  -->  00:02:17.040
And if you moved to a new area code, 
everything got so much more complicated.
36

36

00:02:17.040  -->  00:02:19.770
Well, IP addresses are just like that.
37

37

00:02:19.770  -->  00:02:23.710
Computers use IP addresses to 
find the location of your computer,
38

38

00:02:23.710  -->  00:02:27.550
or alternatively find the server that you're 
trying to get the information from.
39

39

00:02:27.550  -->  00:02:31.980
They're the addresses of the web and 
every connected device has one.
40

40

00:02:31.980  -->  00:02:36.990
Yes, even the computer you're using right 
this second has its own unique IP address.
41

41

00:02:36.990  -->  00:02:38.190
Who decides this number?
42

42

00:02:38.190  -->  00:02:40.430
I don't know, either God or the ISP.
43

43

00:02:40.430  -->  00:02:43.660
So, how much more do you actually 
need to know about IP addresses?
44

44

00:02:43.660  -->  00:02:46.000
Well, to be honest, nothing.
45

45

00:02:46.000  -->  00:02:52.440
There is an insane amount of detail you could 
get into about why they are the way they are,
46

46

00:02:52.440  -->  00:02:55.400
but if I had to teach you that, I think I would quit.
47

47

00:02:55.400  -->  00:02:59.000
What you do need to know is that 
every time you type a domain name
48

48

00:02:59.000  -->  00:03:02.310
into your web browser, your browser actually has no idea
49

49

00:03:02.310  -->  00:03:05.520
where the server holding that information for that domain is.
50

50

00:03:05.520  -->  00:03:10.590
The way it figures it out is through what's 
called the DNS, which is our third concept,
51

51

00:03:10.590  -->  00:03:12.960
and it stands for the Domain Name System.
52

52

00:03:12.960  -->  00:03:15.710
If you at home were trying to guess what the DNS stands for,
53

53

00:03:15.710  -->  00:03:20.760
and you said something like Domain Name Server, 
or Service, you would be wrong,
54

54

00:03:20.760  -->  00:03:25.200
and somewhere out there there is a 
dev ops engineer that just shed a single tear.
55

55

00:03:25.200  -->  00:03:30.980
The DNS is a loose configuration of roughly 
eight trillion (that's a rough guess) servers
56

56

00:03:30.980  -->  00:03:36.780
that hold one piece of information: what IP address 
is associated with what domain name.
57

57

00:03:36.780  -->  00:03:42.020
That's it. You say you want to go to hamsterdance, 
your computer asks the DNS
58

58

00:03:42.020  -->  00:03:44.830
"Donde esta la hamsterdance?"
59

59

00:03:44.830  -->  00:03:50.830
and it responds with 12.586.07.23
60

60

00:03:50.830  -->  00:03:53.760
and away you go towards your dancing hamster website.
61

61

00:03:53.760  -->  00:03:56.060
Pretty simple, but worth understanding.
62

62

00:03:56.060  -->  00:04:02.230
Now, when you purchase or buy a domain, 
you'll need to attach it to a web server
63

63

00:04:02.230  -->  00:04:06.940
to host your application or site. In order to do that you have to
64

64

00:04:06.940  -->  00:04:11.420
update the DNS as to where that information is going to be stored.
65

65

00:04:11.420  -->  00:04:15.550
Ok, are you ready for one last term that 
you can learn in roughly four seconds?
66

66

00:04:15.550  -->  00:04:19.900
Have you ever heard of the ICANN, spelled I-C-A-N-N?
67

67

00:04:19.900  -->  00:04:23.530
It stands for the International Corporation of Associated Names and Numbers
68

68

00:04:23.530  -->  00:04:27.930
and it's the non-profit overlord that rules over all of these things
69

69

00:04:27.930  -->  00:04:32.100
and decides if your domain name you're craving is actually available.
70

70

00:04:32.100  -->  00:04:35.100
So, get it? DNS just tells your browser,
71

71

00:04:35.100  -->  00:04:38.630
"Hey, that's a funny url name, 
here's the IP address to find it,"
72

72

00:04:38.630  -->  00:04:44.350
and the ICANN is what you use to understand who 
owns that domain and whether or not it's available.
73

73

00:04:44.350  -->  00:04:47.450
Gross oversimplification, but it doesn't really matter.
74

74

00:04:47.450  -->  00:04:50.000
All right guys, that's it for now, see you in the next lecture!
