00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.030
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.030  -->  00:00:07.750
Ok, so this lecture, we're going to go from the hard to install,
3

3

00:00:07.750  -->  00:00:11.450
somewhat hard to customize, but you can do everything CMS systems
4

4

00:00:11.450  -->  00:00:16.600
towards the new guard, and start looking at the new ones that are more focused
5

5

00:00:16.600  -->  00:00:19.660
on being a company, raising money, making money,
6

6

00:00:19.660  -->  00:00:22.920
and making sites that are easier to put together and prettier.
7

7

00:00:22.920  -->  00:00:25.450
So, this lecture, we're going to look at Shopify.
8

8

00:00:25.450  -->  00:00:30.370
Now, remember, Shopify was the new guard version of Magento.
9

9

00:00:30.370  -->  00:00:36.640
Shopify is the one that is built in Ruby on Rails, 
and is actually pretty well known for that,
10

10

00:00:36.640  -->  00:00:40.880
and that actually caused a problem in their ecosystem.
11

11

00:00:40.880  -->  00:00:45.450
So this is what their website looks like, and you can kind of tell right off the bat,
12

12

00:00:45.450  -->  00:00:49.220
it doesn't look like something from ten years ago,
13

13

00:00:49.220  -->  00:00:52.620
such is the case when you look at like WordPress or Drupal.
14

14

00:00:52.620  -->  00:00:57.630
For the most part, you can tell very quickly that there is a focus on looks,
15

15

00:00:57.630  -->  00:01:03.440
there is a focus on being a SaaS product, meaning they charge you every month,
16

16

00:01:03.440  -->  00:01:06.840
and you don't ever download the code for Shopify.
17

17

00:01:06.840  -->  00:01:09.910
Remember, before, we would download the code for Drupal,
18

18

00:01:09.910  -->  00:01:13.580
or download the code for WordPress, we'd install it on our web server,
19

19

00:01:13.580  -->  00:01:17.480
that is not the case with these new CMS systems.
20

20

00:01:17.480  -->  00:01:20.700
The way these guys work is that they're going to want you
21

21

00:01:20.700  -->  00:01:24.760
to just sign up and do everything through them.
22

22

00:01:24.760  -->  00:01:26.590
So we'll just play around with it.
23

23

00:01:26.590  -->  00:01:28.840
So we'll create a fake account.
24

24

00:01:32.300  -->  00:01:33.520
See how it's doing everything for me?
25

25

00:01:33.520  -->  00:01:36.230
I didn't have to navigate through the website and click on something,
26

26

00:01:36.230  -->  00:01:39.080
and then set up the SQL database, and then install all that.
27

27

00:01:39.080  -->  00:01:41.540
It's actually quite a bit more simple.
28

28

00:01:41.540  -->  00:01:44.780
So we'll just fill this one out, and...
29

29

00:01:44.780  -->  00:01:47.980
what's my business... we don't even need to name it.
30

30

00:01:47.980  -->  00:01:50.620
All right, so they want you to tell them more about yourself.
31

31

00:01:50.620  -->  00:01:53.650
Why? Because they want to sell stuff to you.
32

32

00:01:53.650  -->  00:01:54.450
That's pretty much it.
33

33

00:01:54.450  -->  00:01:58.150
If you guys... this is a true story, if you actually 
fill this out, and say you're selling products,
34

34

00:01:58.150  -->  00:02:02.180
and you sell over a million dollars a month, someone will magically call you on the phone,
35

35

00:02:02.180  -->  00:02:06.800
so be careful about that one, if you don't want to talk to someone on the phone.
36

36

00:02:06.800  -->  00:02:07.600
Yatta, yatta, yatta.
37

37

00:02:07.600  -->  00:02:09.340
So let's say "enter my store."
38

38

00:02:09.340  -->  00:02:13.800
Ok, so this is the administration panel for building something in Shopify,
39

39

00:02:13.800  -->  00:02:16.160
it kind of looks like WordPress, right?
40

40

00:02:16.160  -->  00:02:18.780
It kind of looks like Drupal, like we have a panel here,
41

41

00:02:18.780  -->  00:02:23.810
and we just kind of pick stuff on the side, 
and that's how we go through this process.
42

42

00:02:23.810  -->  00:02:28.590
At this point, they kind of stop the 1-2-3-4 step process,
43

43

00:02:28.590  -->  00:02:32.550
but they are suggesting here that you go down the list.
44

44

00:02:32.550  -->  00:02:34.920
Add a product, customize the looks, add a customized name,
45

45

00:02:34.920  -->  00:02:36.850
and you just kind of go all the way down.
46

46

00:02:36.850  -->  00:02:38.930
Then, over here, it's more of the optional stuff.
47

47

00:02:39.940  -->  00:02:41.900
You'll notice, again, this is e-commerce,
48

48

00:02:41.900  -->  00:02:44.770
so what's the first thing right after the home button?
49

49

00:02:44.770  -->  00:02:45.800
It's the orders.
50

50

00:02:45.800  -->  00:02:53.040
So they give you a lot of support for handling and figuring out orders.
51

51

00:02:53.040  -->  00:02:58.000
Anyway, now, let's say I wanted to customize the look and feel of my online store.
52

52

00:02:58.000  -->  00:03:00.320
Now, they have tons and tons of templates.
53

53

00:03:00.320  -->  00:03:08.180
For the most part, from what I understand, there are only some free themes,
54

54

00:03:08.180  -->  00:03:12.280
because, keep in mind, you're paying Shopify every single month to use their service,
55

55

00:03:12.280  -->  00:03:16.600
so it's a little bit extra if they're going to charge you for a lot of their themes.
56

56

00:03:16.600  -->  00:03:20.910
And they do, as you noticed, there's some 
of these custom ones that are quite expensive.
57

57

00:03:20.910  -->  00:03:23.740
You noticed with the WordPress, and the Drupal, and Magento,
58

58

00:03:23.740  -->  00:03:25.540
most of those themes are not very expensive.
59

59

00:03:25.540  -->  00:03:29.740
But, again, this company makes a lot of money, and that's their main focus,
60

60

00:03:29.740  -->  00:03:34.420
so they want to make sure that you have whatever 
you want to get you started as soon as possible.
61

61

00:03:34.420  -->  00:03:36.340
Believe it or not, they actually have so many themes
62

62

00:03:36.340  -->  00:03:39.690
that there is not actually a strong demand within the community that uses Shopify
63

63

00:03:39.690  -->  00:03:46.600
for modifying in detail the aesthetics of their sites.
64

64

00:03:46.600  -->  00:03:49.780
What I mean by that is in WordPress, people will download a theme,
65

65

00:03:49.780  -->  00:03:54.000
and then they'll go and they'll modify the code of their theme to make it just right,
66

66

00:03:54.000  -->  00:03:57.800
whereas with Shopify, Shopify is just taking upon themselves to create
67

67

00:03:57.800  -->  00:04:02.780
as many different templates as they possibly can, 
so that no one can possibly complain.
68

68

00:04:02.780  -->  00:04:07.490
Again, like I said before, if you're within a standard use case,
69

69

00:04:07.490  -->  00:04:10.920
you don't care about using exclusive design,
70

70

00:04:10.920  -->  00:04:15.020
then these new guard CMS systems are actually pretty helpful.
71

71

00:04:15.020  -->  00:04:19.330
I mean, as you can see, an example, these are 
real live companies that make lots of money,
72

72

00:04:19.330  -->  00:04:24.970
and this is quite literally a theme you can find on Shopify.
73

73

00:04:24.970  -->  00:04:29.730
They have set it up pretty much in any way you could possibly think of
74

74

00:04:29.730  -->  00:04:32.880
because they separate them out by business category.
75

75

00:04:32.880  -->  00:04:36.110
I don't know if you guys have ever seen my 
Growth Marketing course with my co-instructor,
76

76

00:04:36.110  -->  00:04:39.320
this is actually the company he runs, and he uses Shopify.
77

77

00:04:39.320  -->  00:04:44.620
I know that he is leaving Shopify soon, because they charge a percentage of sales,
78

78

00:04:44.620  -->  00:04:48.030
and that is an interesting dynamic, something to keep in mind
79

79

00:04:48.030  -->  00:04:52.400
when you think about using something like Shopify or SquareSpace.
80

80

00:04:52.400  -->  00:04:55.770
They're trying to get their hands on more of the money that you make,
81

81

00:04:55.770  -->  00:04:59.860
so often what ends up happening is that companies that use these services
82

82

00:04:59.860  -->  00:05:02.750
start off on them, and then they end up paying more money
83

83

00:05:02.750  -->  00:05:06.300
to create their own platform to get off of these systems.
84

84

00:05:06.300  -->  00:05:08.980
Why? Because once you start making money it's not worth it
85

85

00:05:08.980  -->  00:05:13.780
to pay Shopify 5-10% if you're making millions of dollars.
86

86

00:05:13.780  -->  00:05:16.420
At that point you just pay someone to make your own actual website.
87

87

00:05:16.420  -->  00:05:19.800
All right, so we'll tinker out a little bit more, and kind of
88

88

00:05:19.800  -->  00:05:22.430
get a little bit more acquainted with how this system works.
89

89

00:05:22.430  -->  00:05:25.060
So let's say we're going to customize the look and feel.
90

90

00:05:25.060  -->  00:05:30.150
I could've bought a theme or downloaded a theme and then installed it,
91

91

00:05:30.150  -->  00:05:35.270
but for the most part, we're just going to 
take one that they have within the system already.
92

92

00:05:35.270  -->  00:05:42.910
So let's say we're going to make a shop that sells hipster accessories. Great.
93

93

00:05:42.910  -->  00:05:45.350
All right, so right here, it's going to give me some information about it.
94

94

00:05:45.350  -->  00:05:48.340
Great, ok, so it says that it's already installed,
95

95

00:05:48.340  -->  00:05:51.020
which means that I should be able to find it.
96

96

00:05:51.020  -->  00:05:53.660
So if I went up here and just clicked "customize your theme"
97

97

00:05:53.660  -->  00:05:56.860
it'll actually show me that theme I just tried to install,
98

98

00:05:56.860  -->  00:06:01.070
so then I can sell my reclaimed wood benches,
99

99

00:06:01.070  -->  00:06:06.370
and my retro sunglasses, and leather bound watches.
100

100

00:06:06.370  -->  00:06:12.530
So right here, it's called the Debut theme, and it's going to divide it into sections.
101

101

00:06:12.530  -->  00:06:15.110
Again, they try to control a lot of the process, so
102

102

00:06:15.110  -->  00:06:17.980
you only get to say what you want to put in the header, and the image,
103

103

00:06:17.980  -->  00:06:21.180
and the featured collection, and they really make sure that
104

104

00:06:21.180  -->  00:06:23.260
there's only so many things you can change.
105

105

00:06:23.260  -->  00:06:27.850
And to prove that point, you go and look 
at the header, this is what it's talking about.
106

106

00:06:27.850  -->  00:06:34.350
So I can only modify this in terms of the size,
107

107

00:06:34.350  -->  00:06:42.200
what it's called, and what it says in some of the text.
108

108

00:06:42.200  -->  00:06:44.250
So, let's say, if we wanted to put like, the logo in the middle,
109

109

00:06:44.250  -->  00:06:48.880
ok, cool, left, if we wanted to upload an image, replace my last name there.
110

110

00:06:48.880  -->  00:06:50.320
Great.
111

111

00:06:50.320  -->  00:06:52.550
But that is pretty much all you get.
112

112

00:06:52.550  -->  00:06:59.260
Ok, so let's see if we wanted to install a different theme.
113

113

00:06:59.260  -->  00:07:03.180
All right, so we go back here, let's see another free one,
114

114

00:07:03.180  -->  00:07:06.260
sorry, I'm cheap, but I don't want to pay for these.
115

115

00:07:06.260  -->  00:07:08.080
Let's use Jumpstart.
116

116

00:07:08.080  -->  00:07:11.300
Great, ok. Built for small inventory, slideshow, goal tracking tool.
117

117

00:07:11.300  -->  00:07:13.760
"As seen on" section, interesting.
118

118

00:07:13.760  -->  00:07:14.950
All right, so we'll install it.
119

119

00:07:14.950  -->  00:07:19.800
Right, so what I have to do is I have to go to this part, hit "publish"
120

120

00:07:19.800  -->  00:07:23.420
and that's going to put it on my actual website.
121

121

00:07:23.420  -->  00:07:27.250
Then I go to "customize" and here I should be able to see it.
122

122

00:07:27.250  -->  00:07:29.640
Ok, so it's the Jumpstart theme,
123

123

00:07:29.640  -->  00:07:31.190
and here you go.
124

124

00:07:31.190  -->  00:07:35.850
It allows me to put a video right there, in the center,
125

125

00:07:35.850  -->  00:07:40.580
I can put a thumbnail for what's back here, put the text,
126

126

00:07:40.580  -->  00:07:44.470
and then I need to link to YouTube, or Vimeo.
127

127

00:07:44.470  -->  00:07:48.310
Now, in WordPress, if you were going to 
do that, it would be a whole different thing.
128

128

00:07:48.310  -->  00:07:51.480
You'd have to upload the file to your server,
129

129

00:07:51.480  -->  00:07:54.420
you'd have to point the thing in the right direction,
130

130

00:07:54.420  -->  00:07:56.300
you'd have to put a direct URL, an image.
131

131

00:07:56.300  -->  00:08:00.080
Here, it's just a box you put in, so much, much more simple,
132

132

00:08:00.080  -->  00:08:03.120
but again, if you had to modify something beyond the obvious points,
133

133

00:08:03.120  -->  00:08:05.390
well, you wouldn't have a lot of options.
134

134

00:08:05.390  -->  00:08:09.880
So let's say that, you know, maybe we wanted 
to modify some of these individual sections,
135

135

00:08:09.880  -->  00:08:12.700
notice how it's set up in a long form page design,
136

136

00:08:12.700  -->  00:08:16.780
so essentially each section is something I can modify,
137

137

00:08:16.780  -->  00:08:18.740
you'll notice this when you go over here.
138

138

00:08:18.740  -->  00:08:21.970
Talk about your brand, ok, well, talk about your brand is there, right?
139

139

00:08:21.970  -->  00:08:24.600
And then, let's see.
140

140

00:08:24.600  -->  00:08:27.440
So text columns with icons, that's how I change that one.
141

141

00:08:27.440  -->  00:08:30.340
Let's say we wanted to change "talk about your brand,"
142

142

00:08:30.340  -->  00:08:32.140
let's say that I wanted to change it...
143

143

00:08:32.140  -->  00:08:36.600
Hm, let's see, we can put it bold,
144

144

00:08:36.600  -->  00:08:39.400
you can kind of play around with it.
145

145

00:08:39.400  -->  00:08:43.340
Shopify costs too much money.
146

146

00:08:43.340  -->  00:08:46.300
Show you how I really feel, and yeah.
147

147

00:08:46.300  -->  00:08:47.680
So you kind of get the gist of it.
148

148

00:08:47.680  -->  00:08:50.440
If I wanted to delete that section, I can delete that section.
149

149

00:08:50.440  -->  00:08:51.980
Ok.
150

150

00:08:51.980  -->  00:08:57.380
So let's leave this disaster we've created and go back.
151

151

00:08:57.380  -->  00:09:00.920
All right, now, remember how I mentioned that Shopify can't handle blog posts
152

152

00:09:00.920  -->  00:09:04.060
because most stores aren't going to have blogs anyway.
153

153

00:09:04.060  -->  00:09:07.980
So here's a good example, they have a section 
on the online store called blog post,
154

154

00:09:07.980  -->  00:09:11.460
and you can create a blog post, and it's going to look similar-ish to WordPress,
155

155

00:09:11.460  -->  00:09:15.060
not as much creative control again.
156

156

00:09:15.060  -->  00:09:19.430
God, I have a featured image, a featured image is 
that first image you see when you load the page,
157

157

00:09:19.430  -->  00:09:21.800
if you don't want that, oops, sorry,
158

158

00:09:21.800  -->  00:09:25.100
and then the rest of it is just kind of here.
159

159

00:09:25.100  -->  00:09:26.530
How do you change the theme for this?
160

160

00:09:26.530  -->  00:09:30.570
Well, that's actually dictated by the theme we installed before in the store.
161

161

00:09:30.570  -->  00:09:31.670
Yeah, anyway.
162

162

00:09:31.670  -->  00:09:38.150
One other thing worth pointing out is that 
with Shopify, again, you have to use their domain,
163

163

00:09:38.150  -->  00:09:42.830
so this would be kimbrell.shopify.com if I wanted to access it,
164

164

00:09:42.830  -->  00:09:46.080
unless I wanted to pay more money and buy a new domain.
165

165

00:09:46.080  -->  00:09:49.030
So I'd have to buy it through them, or add it this way,
166

166

00:09:49.030  -->  00:09:52.300
either case, I'm going to have to pay money and set that up.
167

167

00:09:52.300  -->  00:09:56.700
So, if you are out there just testing something, you can do it from the .shopify.com,
168

168

00:09:56.700  -->  00:09:59.900
but otherwise you're going to have to pay money and use the custom domain.
169

169

00:09:59.900  -->  00:10:03.010
This is a common theme you'll see with new CMS systems.
170

170

00:10:03.010  -->  00:10:06.450
All right guys, I've exhausted pretty much 
everything I wanted to say about Shopify,
171

171

00:10:06.450  -->  00:10:09.750
check it out on your own, Shopify.com,
172

172

00:10:09.750  -->  00:10:14.350
it's used for e-commerce stores, if you're trying to do something quick,
173

173

00:10:14.350  -->  00:10:17.460
and you have stuff to sell, and you don't want to have to handle maintenance,
174

174

00:10:17.460  -->  00:10:20.600
and installing all these crazy custom themes,
175

175

00:10:20.600  -->  00:10:22.450
or go through what we went through with Drupal,
176

176

00:10:22.450  -->  00:10:24.250
then Shopify is probably the answer.
177

177

00:10:24.250  -->  00:10:27.100
Just keep in mind, they're going to take a percentage of your sales,
178

178

00:10:27.100  -->  00:10:30.340
so once you have some success, you're 
probably going to have to move off of them.
179

179

00:10:30.340  -->  00:10:31.570
All right guys, see you in the next lecture!
