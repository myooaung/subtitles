1

00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,300
All right, welcome back.
2

2

00:00:01,300  -->  00:00:06,350
Let's lurch further into time and get 
closer to things that are interesting.
3

3

00:00:06,350  -->  00:00:10,570
So how is it that a black command screen 
got to where we are today?
4

4

00:00:10,570  -->  00:00:15,540
Well, there's a really long answer, and then 
there's the answer I'm going to give you.
5

5

00:00:15,540  -->  00:00:18,580
And the answer is: because Steve Jobs.
6

6

00:00:18,580  -->  00:00:23,350
As is so often the answer to questions 
in Silicon Valley, "because Steve Jobs"
7

7

00:00:23,350  -->  00:00:28,260
is actually an easy and not too 
oversimplified way of explaining this.
8

8

00:00:28,260  -->  00:00:32,520
All right, so in the 1980s, we had two dueling stars,
9

9

00:00:32,520  -->  00:00:35,500
we had Sir Bill Gates and Sir Steven Jobs.
10

10

00:00:35,500  -->  00:00:40,170
They weren't fighting over the iPod versus the Zune, 
or the iPad versus
11

11

00:00:40,170  -->  00:00:42,970
whatever the Microsoft tablet was called,
12

12

00:00:42,970  -->  00:00:44,880
they were fighting over something entirely different.
13

13

00:00:44,880  -->  00:00:49,280
They were fighting over how to make MS-DOS, 
that black screen operating system
14

14

00:00:49,280  -->  00:00:52,480
we just talked about, and other similar operating systems better.
15

15

00:00:52,480  -->  00:00:56,720
Well, the idea came to Steve Jobs 
one day while staring out the window,
16

16

00:00:56,720  -->  00:00:59,720
and after hours of number crunching on a whiteboard.
17

17

00:00:59,720  -->  00:01:02,000
I'm actually entirely kidding.
18

18

00:01:02,000  -->  00:01:06,330
The idea just came when he stole it 
from a company named Xerox.
19

19

00:01:06,330  -->  00:01:10,670
You see, back in the day, Xerox 
- remember the X-E-R-O-X
20

20

00:01:10,670  -->  00:01:15,050
- they didn't just make printers 
that lied about being low on toner.
21

21

00:01:15,050  -->  00:01:18,130
They made all sorts of computers and operating systems,
22

22

00:01:18,130  -->  00:01:20,210
and they did actually a lot of stuff.
23

23

00:01:20,210  -->  00:01:24,330
Their biggest innovation was something 
called the GUI, or which is pronounced,
24

24

00:01:24,330  -->  00:01:27,220
I'm not even joking, "gooey". Yes, "gooey."
25

25

00:01:27,220  -->  00:01:31,190
GUI stood for Graphic User Interface.
26

26

00:01:31,190  -->  00:01:36,260
Keep in mind, up until this point, operating 
systems were text based user interfaces.
27

27

00:01:36,260  -->  00:01:40,760
GUIs were Graphic User Interfaces.
28

28

00:01:40,760  -->  00:01:47,140
Xerox decided, "Hey, why not make a visual 
representation of the file system on a computer,
29

29

00:01:47,140  -->  00:01:52,170
and then create a clicking little plastic piece 
that you could use to navigate everything."
30

30

00:01:52,170  -->  00:01:55,080
Believe it or not, this is actually a radical way of thinking.
31

31

00:01:55,080  -->  00:02:02,020
If you lived in a world of just text commands, 
and I said, "Hey, let's do text commands,
32

32

00:02:02,020  -->  00:02:07,320
but instead of text let's only use images," 
you would probably look at me
33

33

00:02:07,320  -->  00:02:10,160
similar to the way an Amish person looks at a cell phone.
34

34

00:02:10,160  -->  00:02:15,200
In one of the biggest business strategy 
face palms of all time, Xerox, for some reason,
35

35

00:02:15,200  -->  00:02:19,570
invited Steve Jobs to come see this brand new experimental GUI.
36

36

00:02:19,570  -->  00:02:23,670
Steve said "Thanks, this is interesting, 
and I'm not at all going to copy it"
37

37

00:02:23,670  -->  00:02:28,440
and then proceeded promptly to copy it, 
but add the one thing we all agree
38

38

00:02:28,440  -->  00:02:31,630
that was great about Steve Jobs 
- he knew how to package things in a way
39

39

00:02:31,630  -->  00:02:35,190
that regular consumers would appreciate, 
and more importantly, buy.
40

40

00:02:35,190  -->  00:02:39,460
Using his product design orientation 
and his absolute disgust with things
41

41

00:02:39,460  -->  00:02:43,830
that were over complicated, he came out 
with the first graphic user interface,
42

42

00:02:43,830  -->  00:02:45,650
with what he called Macintosh.
43

43

00:02:45,650  -->  00:02:51,200
The GUI in this case could translate images 
and mouse clicks, it could translate
44

44

00:02:51,200  -->  00:02:56,640
motion on the screen, and opening things 
down to lower level machine code.
45

45

00:02:56,640  -->  00:03:00,430
As an interpreter, operating systems 
were getting considerably better.
46

46

00:03:00,430  -->  00:03:04,510
We went from just text to actual image manipulation.
47

47

00:03:04,510  -->  00:03:10,120
Really, the rest is history. 
Bill Gates then decided to steal that same idea from Steve Jobs,
48

48

00:03:10,120  -->  00:03:12,660
spawning the movie "Pirates of Silicon Valley."
49

49

00:03:12,660  -->  00:03:16,460
Graphics got more complicated, 
processes got somewhat simplified,
50

50

00:03:16,460  -->  00:03:20,260
and a new breed of software bloomed under GUIs.
51

51

00:03:20,260  -->  00:03:24,070
Software could use images, and buttons, 
and form fields, and pretty much
52

52

00:03:24,070  -->  00:03:27,720
everything we today think of with operating systems.
53

53

00:03:27,720  -->  00:03:33,180
Now, today there are three main operating 
systems that you need to be aware of.
54

54

00:03:33,180  -->  00:03:37,310
There's Windows, there's Macintosh OS, for operating system,
55

55

00:03:37,310  -->  00:03:39,380
and there's that penguin thing called Linux.
56

56

00:03:39,380  -->  00:03:42,010
Now, Windows is the brain child of Microsoft and
57

57

00:03:42,010  -->  00:03:45,420
the first graphic user interface to really catch fire in the 90s.
58

58

00:03:45,420  -->  00:03:49,490
Back in the 90s, very few people actually used Macintoshes.
59

59

00:03:49,490  -->  00:03:55,230
Yes, hipsters sat in coffee shops using ]N*gasp* Windows operated laptops.
60

60

00:03:55,230  -->  00:03:57,000
Well, I mean, it's kind of an exaggeration, because
61

61

00:03:57,000  -->  00:04:00,800
they didn't have laptops, but they didn't use Macs.
62

62

00:04:00,800  -->  00:04:04,040
The point here, believe it or not, is that 
once upon a time, Windows was cool.
63

63

00:04:04,040  -->  00:04:07,580
Now, Windows' basic mission statement 
was to make an operating system
64

64

00:04:07,580  -->  00:04:09,710
that appealed to everyone.
65

65

00:04:09,710  -->  00:04:12,620
People who were not technical 
could learn how to use Windows
66

66

00:04:12,620  -->  00:04:14,830
relatively easily, which is still true.
67

67

00:04:14,830  -->  00:04:19,220
Those that were technical, or who wanted 
to really learn how to use their computer
68

68

00:04:19,220  -->  00:04:24,960
were offered pretty much unlimited tools and 
options for digging in and customizing it.
69

69

00:04:24,960  -->  00:04:29,300
In the 90s, as computers were still a novelty, 
sales relied heavily
70

70

00:04:29,300  -->  00:04:34,140
on that second type of user, what we 
who wear the suits call power users.
71

71

00:04:34,140  -->  00:04:39,180
Computers, remember, used to be just for hobbyists, 
because they were so hard to use.
72

72

00:04:39,180  -->  00:04:44,320
With more accessible software though, 
more people used it, but it wasn't really
73

73

00:04:44,320  -->  00:04:47,650
until the 2000s that operating systems were being accessed
74

74

00:04:47,650  -->  00:04:51,050
by the full spectrum of the human population.
75

75

00:04:51,050  -->  00:04:54,190
In the 90s, you could pretty much get away 
without owning a computer.
76

76

00:04:54,190  -->  00:04:57,090
If you don't own a computer now, well, 
yeah, you're probably Amish,
77

77

00:04:57,090  -->  00:05:00,460
or one of those people that wear 
the top hats and the curls.
78

78

00:05:00,460  -->  00:05:04,570
I'm also assuming there's no Amish watching, 
I'm sure it's a safe assumption.
79

79

00:05:04,570  -->  00:05:08,400
So with this demographic shift, 
Steve Jobs and his characteristic impatience
80

80

00:05:08,400  -->  00:05:11,370
with complicated things came to the forefront yet again.
81

81

00:05:11,370  -->  00:05:16,850
By restricting his operating system, known as Mac OS, 
and making it dead simple to use,
82

82

00:05:16,850  -->  00:05:20,950
the legions of non-technical people finally felt a little bit
83

83

00:05:20,950  -->  00:05:23,520
more comfortable using a personal computer.
84

84

00:05:23,520  -->  00:05:25,550
I'm talking about people like my mom.
85

85

00:05:25,550  -->  00:05:30,330
You see, in the Steve Jobs operating system, 
there is no start button.
86

86

00:05:30,330  -->  00:05:33,630
There are no such things as drivers that you have to install.
87

87

00:05:33,630  -->  00:05:35,260
You want to uninstall something?
88

88

00:05:35,260  -->  00:05:39,670
There's no uninstall script, you just drag it into the trash.
89

89

00:05:39,670  -->  00:05:41,770
Want to protect yourself from viruses?
90

90

00:05:41,770  -->  00:05:46,700
Well, then spend hours studying which antivirus software is best.
91

91

00:05:46,700  -->  00:05:51,280
I'm actually kidding, Macintosh OS 
automatically protects you from viruses.
92

92

00:05:51,280  -->  00:05:54,220
Mac OS was everything Steve Jobs loved.
93

93

00:05:54,220  -->  00:05:57,520
One, it was simple. 
Two, it was aesthetically pleasing,
94

94

00:05:57,520  -->  00:06:02,490
and three, it locked you into a pretty 
but overpriced clam shell device.
95

95

00:06:02,490  -->  00:06:07,360
This combination, with the addition and 
popularity of the iPod and the iPhone,
96

96

00:06:07,360  -->  00:06:11,500
pushed Mac usage in market share 
close to around the same as Windows.
97

97

00:06:11,500  -->  00:06:16,270
Today the two are still by far the most 
popular ways to get your computing done.
98

98

00:06:16,270  -->  00:06:18,770
It's a bit like the Capulets and the Montagues.
99

99

00:06:18,770  -->  00:06:22,850
Everyone who cares about computers 
in any way has a strong opinion
100

100

00:06:22,850  -->  00:06:25,550
about which operating system they prefer and why,
101

101

00:06:25,550  -->  00:06:30,390
but it's important to understand why 
they came about and what they changed.
102

102

00:06:30,390  -->  00:06:34,090
Now, while this horse jockeying between 
Windows and Mac OS was happening,
103

103

00:06:34,090  -->  00:06:39,130
there was a third option that was being built on the side. 
That was called Linux.
104

104

00:06:39,130  -->  00:06:42,560
Linux was the "third way", the Gary Johnson, so to speak,
105

105

00:06:42,560  -->  00:06:46,740
and it was built by and relied on 
by a small group of dedicated enthusiasts.
106

106

00:06:46,740  -->  00:06:49,570
Now the idea behind the Linux operating system 
was that it was going to be
107

107

00:06:49,570  -->  00:06:52,640
completely free and completely un-restricted.
108

108

00:06:52,640  -->  00:06:57,350
There was no large company with shareholders 
that they had to satisfy behind this system
109

109

00:06:57,350  -->  00:07:01,480
and anyone using it could modify virtually anything they wanted.
110

110

00:07:01,480  -->  00:07:04,020
Linux was the original mainstream example of
111

111

00:07:04,020  -->  00:07:07,690
the concept that we'll talk about more and later, of "open source."
112

112

00:07:07,690  -->  00:07:12,230
Nowadays, Linux is used primarily 
by people with strong technical backgrounds
113

113

00:07:12,230  -->  00:07:16,300
that either subscribe heavily to 
that open source kind of ideology
114

114

00:07:16,300  -->  00:07:21,000
or simply want to have a much larger amount 
of control over the system they use.
115

115

00:07:21,000  -->  00:07:24,210
When you meet someone who uses Linux, 
it's kind of like meeting
116

116

00:07:24,210  -->  00:07:27,340
a third party candidate voter 
in the U.S. during an election year.
117

117

00:07:27,340  -->  00:07:31,780
"You voted for who?" I might ask, except with technology.
118

118

00:07:31,780  -->  00:07:34,650
Now, Linux has come a long way, 
obviously, since it first started out.
119

119

00:07:34,650  -->  00:07:37,640
Nowadays we have all sorts of different versions of Linux,
120

120

00:07:37,640  -->  00:07:39,850
each with somewhat of a different angle.
121

121

00:07:39,850  -->  00:07:44,600
Red Hat Linux is a good example, 
the first Linux to actually have
122

122

00:07:44,600  -->  00:07:47,000
a for profit company behind its development.
123

123

00:07:47,000  -->  00:07:49,470
A couple of other ones worth knowing, 
like Ubuntu and Fedora
124

124

00:07:49,470  -->  00:07:53,100
were the first I know to start emulating Windows in more of an
125

125

00:07:53,100  -->  00:07:56,070
attempt to get average users to come on board using it.
126

126

00:07:56,070  -->  00:07:58,770
Worth noting, and this is something 
we'll get to later in the course,
127

127

00:07:58,770  -->  00:08:02,680
Linux is the dominating operating system for server technology.
128

128

00:08:02,680  -->  00:08:06,850
If you ever installed a server 
for serving websites (probably not),
129

129

00:08:06,850  -->  00:08:08,650
there's a good chance that it uses Linux.
130

130

00:08:08,650  -->  00:08:12,320
We'll cover that, why and how that happened later.
131

131

00:08:12,320  -->  00:08:13,690
All right, let's recap it.
132

132

00:08:13,690  -->  00:08:18,490
Today, we, for the most part, have three main 
operating systems for personal computers:
133

133

00:08:18,490  -->  00:08:21,760
Windows, Macintosh OS, and Linux.
134

134

00:08:21,760  -->  00:08:26,900
Windows was the champion in the 90s 
and tried to be the one-size-fits-all for all customers.
135

135

00:08:26,900  -->  00:08:31,220
It's not hard to use and if you want to customize it, 
you have a decent set of options.
136

136

00:08:31,220  -->  00:08:34,980
Now, Mac OS, on the other hand, in the last ten years or so,
137

137

00:08:34,980  -->  00:08:38,880
has evolved as a response to 
the Windows popularity of the 90s.
138

138

00:08:38,880  -->  00:08:43,720
Mac OS is a much simpler and more restricted version of an operating system
139

139

00:08:43,720  -->  00:08:45,760
that followed the basic idea of
140

140

00:08:45,760  -->  00:08:49,690
"Why give someone ten buttons 
when they realistically only use three?"
141

141

00:08:49,690  -->  00:08:52,890
It also was a mirror image of its larger than life founder
142

142

00:08:52,890  -->  00:08:56,530
who liked things pretty, simple, and closed off.
143

143

00:08:56,530  -->  00:08:59,530
Great for a computer, terrible for an OkCupid profile.
144

144

00:08:59,530  -->  00:09:02,950
The last one is Linux, which is kind of the rebel third party
145

145

00:09:02,950  -->  00:09:05,810
that focused on being free and completely unrestricted.
146

146

00:09:05,810  -->  00:09:09,380
You can do really almost anything 
you want with Linux, except figure out
147

147

00:09:09,380  -->  00:09:14,520
how to open a basic application, or find that file you just saved.
148

148

00:09:14,520  -->  00:09:19,990
That second part is why it never really caught on 
with the majority of the earth human populations.
149

149

00:09:19,990  -->  00:09:21,940
All right guys, that's enough about operating systems.
150

150

00:09:21,940  -->  00:09:23,190
See you in the next lecture!
