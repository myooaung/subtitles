00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.700
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:01.700  -->  00:00:07.800
Ok, so the first concept was syntax, that we learned, 
but while we were covering syntax,
3

3

00:00:07.800  -->  00:00:12.020
you got a preview before of what we're going 
to talk about in this lecture, which is variables.
4

4

00:00:12.020  -->  00:00:14.010
Now, you remember the thing we did in the last lecture,
5

5

00:00:14.010  -->  00:00:18.420
which is that we wrote out "answer equals" 
and we did it in so many different ways.
6

6

00:00:18.420  -->  00:00:23.550
What I'm doing when I say "answer" is I'm creating what's called a variable.
7

7

00:00:23.550  -->  00:00:29.630
So if I were to type in answer equals one, what do you think I'm doing?
8

8

00:00:29.630  -->  00:00:34.530
Well, what I'm doing is I'm associating the number 1 with the word "answer."
9

9

00:00:34.530  -->  00:00:36.600
Now, why would I want to do this?
10

10

00:00:36.600  -->  00:00:42.540
Well, in order for sites to be dynamic, 
you have to do this, you have to use variables.
11

11

00:00:42.540  -->  00:00:45.270
I like to think of variables just as stored information
12

12

00:00:45.270  -->  00:00:48.950
that you can then pass on later on in your program,
13

13

00:00:48.950  -->  00:00:51.320
so that you can manipulate them and use them.
14

14

00:00:51.320  -->  00:00:54.580
There's probably a better, more technically correct way
15

15

00:00:54.580  -->  00:00:56.330
of thinking about it, but that's the way I like to.
16

16

00:00:56.330  -->  00:00:59.700
So, to give you an example, all right, so let's look at this.
17

17

00:00:59.700  -->  00:01:02.420
So we'll say A equals 1.
18

18

00:01:02.420  -->  00:01:04.640
Ok, so we associate 1 with A.
19

19

00:01:04.640  -->  00:01:08.110
Now, what do you think if I said B equals 2?
20

20

00:01:08.110  -->  00:01:12.650
Well, now we have two variables in our programming.
21

21

00:01:12.650  -->  00:01:14.300
A equals 1, B equals 2.
22

22

00:01:14.300  -->  00:01:19.000
Now what do you think would happen if I said A plus B equals C?
23

23

00:01:19.000  -->  00:01:22.780
You can take a wild guess, but what's 
probably going to end up happening
24

24

00:01:22.780  -->  00:01:27.100
is that C is going to equal what? It's going to equal 3 most likely.
25

25

00:01:27.100  -->  00:01:28.520
I don't even have to tell the system to do that.
26

26

00:01:28.520  -->  00:01:31.150
What I could just do is just tell it to display C,
27

27

00:01:31.150  -->  00:01:33.620
and what it would end up displaying over here is 3.
28

28

00:01:33.620  -->  00:01:37.430
I mean, that's the really, really basic version of that.
29

29

00:01:37.430  -->  00:01:43.050
Let's imagine I was making an app that 
needed to let someone, let's say, order food.
30

30

00:01:43.050  -->  00:01:48.610
Kind of like a GrubHub, or a DoorDash, 
or any of those ones, like PostMates now.
31

31

00:01:48.610  -->  00:01:51.710
One of the things I would have to do is give them, say,
32

32

00:01:51.710  -->  00:01:53.450
like the total of their meal,
33

33

00:01:53.450  -->  00:01:57.590
and based on that total they have to calculate the tip.
34

34

00:01:57.590  -->  00:02:02.300
So if I were to do this, I might write something like,
35

35

00:02:02.300  -->  00:02:05.300
and this is not going to be 100% correct, but it's to get the point across.
36

36

00:02:05.300  -->  00:02:09.770
Let's say that the burrito is worth $8.
37

37

00:02:09.770  -->  00:02:13.200
On our menu, chips are worth $2.
38

38

00:02:13.200  -->  00:02:17.340
Great. Now, then I would say, maybe the 
subtotal of what you were going to pay,
39

39

00:02:17.340  -->  00:02:19.340
so we'll create a thing called a subtotal,
40

40

00:02:19.340  -->  00:02:22.900
might be burrito plus chips.
41

41

00:02:22.900  -->  00:02:24.140
Great, now I have the subtotal.
42

42

00:02:24.140  -->  00:02:26.780
But then, how exactly do I calculate the tip?
43

43

00:02:26.780  -->  00:02:30.080
Well, the tip, what we'll say is, let's create a new variable called "tip,"
44

44

00:02:30.080  -->  00:02:32.670
and "tip" will be 0.15.
45

45

00:02:32.670  -->  00:02:36.660
So if I wanted to calculate the actual total that you'd pay,
46

46

00:02:36.660  -->  00:02:38.460
can you guess how I would do this?
47

47

00:02:38.460  -->  00:02:42.590
Let's create a new variable called the "total,"
48

48

00:02:42.590  -->  00:02:46.750
and then what I could do is I could say subtotal times the tip,
49

49

00:02:46.750  -->  00:02:51.050
now that would give us how much they need to pay in tip,
50

50

00:02:51.050  -->  00:02:54.550
but to make it a total, then I have to add in the subtotal again.
51

51

00:02:54.550  -->  00:03:00.300
So what I could do is just say, plus subtotal again, I could do that,
52

52

00:03:00.300  -->  00:03:03.090
because the order of operations in math would just say,
53

53

00:03:03.090  -->  00:03:07.360
run this, then add this, but for the sake of our sanity,
54

54

00:03:07.360  -->  00:03:10.940
to make this prettier, we could actually use parentheses.
55

55

00:03:10.940  -->  00:03:14.200
It's the same thing as running a calculation on your calculator.
56

56

00:03:14.200  -->  00:03:17.460
Ok, so I just set up a bunch of variables to list out what
57

57

00:03:17.460  -->  00:03:19.930
this person potentially could have bought.
58

58

00:03:19.930  -->  00:03:24.940
So this is a decent example of why we might use variables.
59

59

00:03:24.940  -->  00:03:27.870
So I can set the value of pretty much anything on the menu
60

60

00:03:27.870  -->  00:03:31.910
by creating essentially menu items right here.
61

61

00:03:31.910  -->  00:03:36.680
You know, guac might be, we can say it's $1.
62

62

00:03:36.680  -->  00:03:38.850
And I could do this pretty much all day long.
63

63

00:03:38.850  -->  00:03:41.920
So then, on the front page, when someone selects something,
64

64

00:03:41.920  -->  00:03:47.160
the system already has a value for that object, 
so it knows what value to associate with it.
65

65

00:03:47.160  -->  00:03:49.600
Now, why do I have to do it like this?
66

66

00:03:49.600  -->  00:03:52.750
Well, if I didn't have variables, let's imagine a world where
67

67

00:03:52.750  -->  00:03:55.460
I couldn't save this information like I just did,
68

68

00:03:55.460  -->  00:03:59.110
I would have to require the person filling out the page
69

69

00:03:59.110  -->  00:04:02.060
to almost write in the price every single time.
70

70

00:04:02.060  -->  00:04:08.480
So I would have to display the price, 
and then have them actually input it for me.
71

71

00:04:08.480  -->  00:04:11.900
The alternative option you could do is 
what's called hardcoding, where I could just
72

72

00:04:11.900  -->  00:04:15.650
make the page, and no matter what, whenever you pick burritos and chips,
73

73

00:04:15.650  -->  00:04:20.590
it just adds them together based on their value and not as a variable.
74

74

00:04:20.590  -->  00:04:23.880
That's fine, but what happens if the next person comes and buys
75

75

00:04:23.880  -->  00:04:30.180
burritos, chips, and guac, and the system is 
hardcoded to only calculate burritos and chips?
76

76

00:04:30.180  -->  00:04:31.680
It becomes a problem.
77

77

00:04:31.680  -->  00:04:33.680
The other problem that happens is,
78

78

00:04:33.680  -->  00:04:38.000
you know, if I'm making an ordering website, chances are
79

79

00:04:38.000  -->  00:04:41.490
I'm going to use the value of the burrito multiple times.
80

80

00:04:41.490  -->  00:04:45.090
So if I'm selecting my objects, I will see a price, and so
81

81

00:04:45.090  -->  00:04:47.790
the system needs to know to display the price of the burrito.
82

82

00:04:47.790  -->  00:04:53.300
The next page, I might see my cart, and 
my cart will also display the price of the burrito.
83

83

00:04:53.300  -->  00:04:57.900
In the next couple of pages, I'll probably see that over and over again.
84

84

00:04:57.900  -->  00:05:02.570
So if I wanted to change the price, as restaurants frequently do,
85

85

00:05:02.570  -->  00:05:06.250
how annoying would it be to have to go into the code every single time
86

86

00:05:06.250  -->  00:05:10.080
and change every single page where it possibly could have shown up.
87

87

00:05:10.080  -->  00:05:12.920
Instead, I can just go back to the original page,
88

88

00:05:12.920  -->  00:05:17.790
change the value of the variable to add a dollar, and then
89

89

00:05:17.790  -->  00:05:22.140
the pages will just essentially see burrito, they'll display burrito,
90

90

00:05:22.140  -->  00:05:24.250
and the system will know that that is $9.
91

91

00:05:24.250  -->  00:05:26.530
So voila. Don't overthink that one.
92

92

00:05:26.530  -->  00:05:29.570
Variables are used in every single programming language
93

93

00:05:29.570  -->  00:05:36.240
and they actually have a lot of use, they're 
really standard, you have to use them.
94

94

00:05:36.240  -->  00:05:40.370
Another more extreme example of saving variables so they can change
95

95

00:05:40.370  -->  00:05:43.080
across pages, let's say we are using Facebook,
96

96

00:05:43.080  -->  00:05:48.800
and let's say on Facebook, I wanted to change my name.
97

97

00:05:48.800  -->  00:05:55.550
So if I actually went to my Facebook, my name displays right here.
98

98

00:05:55.550  -->  00:05:59.540
See, there is my name, there is my name, everything I post is my name,
99

99

00:05:59.540  -->  00:06:01.030
if this pops up, it has my name.
100

100

00:06:01.030  -->  00:06:07.070
If I wanted to change that name, if we weren't using variables, well,
101

101

00:06:07.070  -->  00:06:12.310
then every single page associated with me 
would have to be then manually updated,
102

102

00:06:12.310  -->  00:06:19.570
whereas if it's just a variable, I can just change my name equals Evan Kimbrell,
103

103

00:06:19.570  -->  00:06:23.120
and I could just change it to whatever I want, Mustache McGee, and then
104

104

00:06:23.120  -->  00:06:26.180
Mustache McGee would display automatically throughout the system,
105

105

00:06:26.180  -->  00:06:29.380
all over here, because it's not writing Evan Kimbrell,
106

106

00:06:29.380  -->  00:06:32.990
it's writing whatever the variable is that stores my name.
107

107

00:06:32.990  -->  00:06:37.230
Ok, so, sweet. We now know how to calculate the total price
108

108

00:06:37.230  -->  00:06:40.360
of a meal at Chipotle, this is really essential learning.
109

109

00:06:40.360  -->  00:06:43.010
Next concept up, we're going to talk about printing.
110

110

00:06:43.010  -->  00:06:44.330
Ok, see you then!
