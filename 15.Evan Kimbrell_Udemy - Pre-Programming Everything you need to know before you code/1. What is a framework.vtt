00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:02.100
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02.100  -->  00:00:05.380
So in this section we're going to tackle two crucial concepts
3

3

00:00:05.380  -->  00:00:09.710
you need to understand to understand modern web and mobile technologies.
4

4

00:00:09.710  -->  00:00:13.210
First, we're going to talk about frameworks, what they are,
5

5

00:00:13.210  -->  00:00:16.720
how you use them, and then we're going to talk about APIs,
6

6

00:00:16.720  -->  00:00:19.250
what they do, and how those things work.
7

7

00:00:19.250  -->  00:00:23.550
So, to start off, let's talk about the first item: frameworks.
8

8

00:00:23.550  -->  00:00:25.520
What is a framework?
9

9

00:00:25.520  -->  00:00:29.460
Well, frameworks, first of all, are probably something you have heard of,
10

10

00:00:29.460  -->  00:00:33.090
but you probably couldn't tell the difference between it and the
11

11

00:00:33.090  -->  00:00:38.110
programming language that was also being referenced in the same sentence.
12

12

00:00:38.110  -->  00:00:40.140
This is completely normal.
13

13

00:00:40.140  -->  00:00:43.520
It's also a very common buzzword you're going to hear
14

14

00:00:43.520  -->  00:00:47.190
because there are a lot of frameworks out there and
15

15

00:00:47.190  -->  00:00:49.210
they're getting more and more popular.
16

16

00:00:49.210  -->  00:00:51.150
That's just adding to the confusion.
17

17

00:00:51.150  -->  00:00:54.460
Now, did anyone out there think that when I said Ruby
18

18

00:00:54.460  -->  00:00:59.060
it sounded weird because I didn't say Ruby on Rails?
19

19

00:00:59.060  -->  00:01:02.900
Well, 90% of the time you'll hear that phrase,
20

20

00:01:02.900  -->  00:01:06.570
Ruby is going to be part of Ruby on Rails.
21

21

00:01:06.570  -->  00:01:10.360
Ruby, out of that phrase, is the programming language,
22

22

00:01:10.360  -->  00:01:11.650
we've talked about that before,
23

23

00:01:11.650  -->  00:01:17.220
and Rails is the name of the framework that pairs really well with Ruby.
24

24

00:01:17.220  -->  00:01:19.780
So what is a framework? I ask yet again.
25

25

00:01:19.780  -->  00:01:23.050
The short version is that a programming framework is basically
26

26

00:01:23.050  -->  00:01:26.950
a predefined structure that programmers can use to build upon,
27

27

00:01:26.950  -->  00:01:30.790
by changing existing code or adding code of their own
28

28

00:01:30.790  -->  00:01:34.790
to create whatever sought after product they're trying to go for.
29

29

00:01:34.790  -->  00:01:37.760
All right, let's break that down so it's a little bit easier to digest.
30

30

00:01:37.760  -->  00:01:41.770
Programming (going back to the basics) is just the way that you make
31

31

00:01:41.770  -->  00:01:48.450
an instructions list for a computer, or an 
operating system, or a browser to do something.
32

32

00:01:48.450  -->  00:01:50.750
So if I wanted to make a blog, let's say,
33

33

00:01:50.750  -->  00:01:55.150
I would write some programming instruction on what images
34

34

00:01:55.150  -->  00:01:58.720
and what text to display, and where to put the buttons.
35

35

00:01:58.720  -->  00:02:01.190
Ok? We're on the same page there.
36

36

00:02:01.190  -->  00:02:05.440
But there are millions of people out there that are creating blogs
37

37

00:02:05.440  -->  00:02:12.040
and 80% of the work in creating a blog is 
something that somebody else has already done.
38

38

00:02:12.040  -->  00:02:16.230
So why would someone spend hundreds of hours re-writing
39

39

00:02:16.230  -->  00:02:21.010
those programmatic instructions for things so basic and common as
40

40

00:02:21.010  -->  00:02:27.620
subscribe to this email list, or take me to a 
page listing out all the article in this blog.
41

41

00:02:27.620  -->  00:02:28.980
That's where frameworks come in.
42

42

00:02:28.980  -->  00:02:32.700
They're pre-made code that attempts to remove or at least
43

43

00:02:32.700  -->  00:02:35.660
speed up the process of making redundant parts.
44

44

00:02:35.660  -->  00:02:37.660
Whenever you make a website or a web app,
45

45

00:02:37.660  -->  00:02:41.560
you'll always have some kind of similar structure.
46

46

00:02:41.560  -->  00:02:45.680
Frameworks will help you by setting up that folder structure
47

47

00:02:45.680  -->  00:02:48.630
and linking everything together for you so that you can spend time
48

48

00:02:48.630  -->  00:02:52.210
working on the parts of the app that are actually different and unique.
49

49

00:02:52.210  -->  00:02:55.500
And since you can write an application in a variety of different languages,
50

50

00:02:55.500  -->  00:03:00.650
we have a variety of different frameworks to cater to each specific language.
51

51

00:03:00.650  -->  00:03:04.980
If you're using PHP, you might use something like the Zend framework,
52

52

00:03:04.980  -->  00:03:10.420
or CakePHP, or one called Laravel or Loravel, I can never pronounce it right.
53

53

00:03:10.420  -->  00:03:15.490
If you're using Python, you might use Django, you might use Flask,
54

54

00:03:15.490  -->  00:03:17.540
you might use this newer one called Pyramid.
55

55

00:03:17.540  -->  00:03:19.100
Different strokes for different folks.
56

56

00:03:19.100  -->  00:03:23.270
Now, the best way to remember this is to use the analogy of a resume,
57

57

00:03:23.270  -->  00:03:26.200
and if you're not American, we'll just say CV.
58

58

00:03:26.200  -->  00:03:32.270
If you were to make a resume / CV, would you make it from complete scratch?
59

59

00:03:32.270  -->  00:03:34.280
Well, first of all, a lot of people do.
60

60

00:03:34.280  -->  00:03:38.890
But you could also use a template, and then within that template
61

61

00:03:38.890  -->  00:03:43.450
edit out the parts you don't want, and customize the parts you do want.
62

62

00:03:43.450  -->  00:03:46.060
And since there are a lot of templates out there,
63

63

00:03:46.060  -->  00:03:49.330
each one might give you something the other doesn't.
64

64

00:03:49.330  -->  00:03:51.230
The same is true of frameworks.
65

65

00:03:51.230  -->  00:03:55.060
Ok, so we have a decent idea of what frameworks are roughly.
66

66

00:03:55.060  -->  00:03:58.090
They're a pre-defined structure that tries to speed up development
67

67

00:03:58.090  -->  00:04:01.680
by giving pre-made elements you can re-use and taking out
68

68

00:04:01.680  -->  00:04:07.680
the tedious part of creating structure 
and redundant tasks, and redundant systems.
69

69

00:04:07.680  -->  00:04:11.280
So in this section we're going to look at some of the most popular frameworks,
70

70

00:04:11.280  -->  00:04:15.330
see what they do, and build some basic familiarity with them.
71

71

00:04:15.330  -->  00:04:17.100
All right guys, see you in the next lecture!
