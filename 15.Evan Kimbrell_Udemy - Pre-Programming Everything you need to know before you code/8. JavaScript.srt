00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,110
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,110  -->  00:00:05,710
All right, so let's talk about the big bad JavaScript.
3

3

00:00:05,710  -->  00:00:11,380
Now, this is not to be confused with Java, 
which is a very popular back-end language
4

4

00:00:11,380  -->  00:00:15,960
used largely by enterprise teams. 
Of course, other companies use it,
5

5

00:00:15,960  -->  00:00:19,720
Twitter is a good example, but it's not the same as JavaScript.
6

6

00:00:19,720  -->  00:00:22,490
Chances are, if you've ever had some 
sort of interest in programming,
7

7

00:00:22,490  -->  00:00:26,370
you probably at some point ran into JavaScript.
8

8

00:00:26,370  -->  00:00:29,410
And it makes sense, because every time we use a web page
9

9

00:00:29,410  -->  00:00:32,570
and something makes you go "Oh, that was cool,"
10

10

00:00:32,570  -->  00:00:36,140
it probably had something to do with JavaScript.
11

11

00:00:36,140  -->  00:00:41,620
JavaScript has come a really long way, 
so even having an understanding of
12

12

00:00:41,620  -->  00:00:45,850
what JavaScript does and is is kind 
of like shooting at a moving target.
13

13

00:00:45,850  -->  00:00:51,580
A moving target that's on fire, and you're also 
on fire, and the whole place is on fire,
14

14

00:00:51,580  -->  00:00:55,630
because JavaScript is one of the most 
obnoxious programming languages to learn.
15

15

00:00:55,630  -->  00:00:59,380
Before we even get into some of 
the details, let's just talk about
16

16

00:00:59,380  -->  00:01:03,670
what JavaScript, or JS for short, does at 10,000 feet.
17

17

00:01:03,670  -->  00:01:07,200
In three words, JavaScript is interactivity.
18

18

00:01:07,200  -->  00:01:10,670
Say that ten times with your eyes 
closed and you'll never forget it.
19

19

00:01:10,670  -->  00:01:13,210
But then, what do I mean by interactivity?
20

20

00:01:13,210  -->  00:01:17,720
Well, I mean clicking buttons, I mean 
pages loading when you scroll,
21

21

00:01:17,720  -->  00:01:21,890
I mean clicking a button and having it 
change the page without refreshing it.
22

22

00:01:21,890  -->  00:01:26,690
JavaScript can show or hide certain parts 
of a webpage depending on the circumstance.
23

23

00:01:26,690  -->  00:01:31,720
It can change font sizes, it can create 
popups, it can create slide-ins,
24

24

00:01:31,720  -->  00:01:35,030
it can load something onto a page 
only when the user needs it,
25

25

00:01:35,030  -->  00:01:38,040
it can even animate elements on the page.
26

26

00:01:38,040  -->  00:01:40,840
But that's not how JavaScript obviously started,
27

27

00:01:40,840  -->  00:01:44,970
and if you've noticed a pattern in these lectures, 
I love me some history.
28

28

00:01:44,970  -->  00:01:50,020
All right, let's teleport back sometime 
into the 1990s, when people had
29

29

00:01:50,020  -->  00:01:57,120
bowl cuts and frosted tips, and artists supported 
themselves exclusively off the sales of CDs.
30

30

00:01:57,120  -->  00:02:00,300
What's an iPod, you say? That's stupid, this is the 90s.
31

31

00:02:00,300  -->  00:02:06,000
So at this point in our teleportation time, 
websites really did only a handful of things.
32

32

00:02:06,000  -->  00:02:11,140
They had text, images, tables, graphs, and maybe forms
33

33

00:02:11,140  -->  00:02:14,640
where you could submit information, but that was really it.
34

34

00:02:14,640  -->  00:02:18,880
One of the biggest problems people were 
having was with the forms themselves.
35

35

00:02:18,880  -->  00:02:23,250
If someone, let's say, submitted a form, 
and they decided to use a username
36

36

00:02:23,250  -->  00:02:26,020
that's already been used or taken by somebody else,
37

37

00:02:26,020  -->  00:02:30,920
there was no real way, prior to JavaScript, to let them know,
38

38

00:02:30,920  -->  00:02:32,620
"Hey, you need to pick a different username."
39

39

00:02:32,620  -->  00:02:36,250
The solutions we had prior to JavaScript 
were very clunky and heavy,
40

40

00:02:36,250  -->  00:02:40,780
and it usually made you go back a couple 
of screens to be forced to be told,
41

41

00:02:40,780  -->  00:02:42,650
"Hey, you need to be a little more original."
42

42

00:02:42,650  -->  00:02:45,950
With JavaScript, you could do that, and that was one of the
43

43

00:02:45,950  -->  00:02:48,880
original functions actually that JavaScript was created for.
44

44

00:02:48,880  -->  00:02:51,730
JavaScript, if you remember from the previous lectures, was actually
45

45

00:02:51,730  -->  00:02:55,050
created by Netscape and the alpha nerd Marc Andreessen.
46

46

00:02:55,050  -->  00:02:58,130
Originally, it was named, no joke, Mocha.
47

47

00:02:58,130  -->  00:03:04,570
I'm assuming it's because Java already existed 
and Cappuccino just isn't that catchy.
48

48

00:03:04,570  -->  00:03:08,430
So, and like that, Marc Andreessen said, "We shall call it Mocha,"
49

49

00:03:08,430  -->  00:03:12,300
which is a good name for a dog, a bad 
name for a programming language.
50

50

00:03:12,300  -->  00:03:15,330
During the browser wars, as browsers wanted to do more,
51

51

00:03:15,330  -->  00:03:18,270
and websites wanted to get all sorts of fancy,
52

52

00:03:18,270  -->  00:03:23,380
JavaScript was the go-to way to make the site 
experience more interesting and enjoyable.
53

53

00:03:23,380  -->  00:03:26,100
It also helped make sites run faster, because it
54

54

00:03:26,100  -->  00:03:28,110
could do things like what we described before,
55

55

00:03:28,110  -->  00:03:31,180
check with the database and stop the user from doing something.
56

56

00:03:31,180  -->  00:03:35,170
The alternative, of course, was the much harder, clunky way of
57

57

00:03:35,170  -->  00:03:40,010
sending a full query after the fact, 
and done manually, which was awful.
58

58

00:03:40,010  -->  00:03:41,530
What else do you need to know about JavaScript?
59

59

00:03:41,530  -->  00:03:44,770
Well, one thing you need to know is 
that JavaScript is quickly becoming
60

60

00:03:44,770  -->  00:03:48,970
one of, if not the most important programming languages out there.
61

61

00:03:48,970  -->  00:03:51,970
Later on in the course, in the tech trends section, we're going to cover
62

62

00:03:51,970  -->  00:03:56,110
the concept of full stack JavaScript, we'll cover what that is,
63

63

00:03:56,110  -->  00:03:58,650
and how exactly it's changing the name of the game.
64

64

00:03:58,650  -->  00:04:02,500
In the framework section, we'll get actually 
more into depth about all the technologies
65

65

00:04:02,500  -->  00:04:07,050
that are popping up to assist JavaScript 
and make it faster and more powerful.
66

66

00:04:07,050  -->  00:04:10,000
There are so many tools designed to help JavaScript,
67

67

00:04:10,000  -->  00:04:13,090
there's actually a term called "JavaScript exhaustion."
68

68

00:04:13,090  -->  00:04:16,540
So here's a common question. Is JavaScript easy to learn?
69

69

00:04:16,540  -->  00:04:20,430
Well, some people say yes, and some people say no.
70

70

00:04:20,430  -->  00:04:26,200
Attached in the resources, we have a guide that 
would argue the latter, saying that it's actually easy.
71

71

00:04:26,200  -->  00:04:30,300
That guide is called JavaScript for Cats, 
because, I guess the idea is that
72

72

00:04:30,300  -->  00:04:34,180
JavaScript is so easy to learn that a self-interested furry mammal
73

73

00:04:34,180  -->  00:04:36,480
with a walnut sized brain could figure it out.
74

74

00:04:36,480  -->  00:04:40,980
Arguing in the "Yes, it's really difficult to learn" corner, actually
75

75

00:04:40,980  -->  00:04:45,490
I've included some online discussions 
in the resources, as to how difficult it is.
76

76

00:04:45,490  -->  00:04:50,290
The most common response to the question 
of "Is it hard?" you'll notice is "Kill me."
77

77

00:04:50,290  -->  00:04:52,730
All right, got it? Next up, we're going to start looking
78

78

00:04:52,730  -->  00:04:56,840
into back-end languages, like PHP, Ruby, and Python.
79

79

00:04:56,840  -->  00:04:58,160
All right, see you there!
