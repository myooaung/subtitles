00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,180
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,180  -->  00:00:06,470
So, in an effort of being balanced, 
let's now take a second to look at
3

3

00:00:06,470  -->  00:00:10,250
the anatomy of mobile sites and mobile apps.
4

4

00:00:10,250  -->  00:00:14,070
I know a lot of you guys out there 
are interested in the mobile space
5

5

00:00:14,070  -->  00:00:18,860
specifically, so let's take a little turn 
and talk specifically about mobile.
6

6

00:00:18,860  -->  00:00:21,860
Ok, so here's the test of how well you've been paying attention.
7

7

00:00:21,860  -->  00:00:25,760
Let's say I'm on my phone and I open up my browser
8

8

00:00:25,760  -->  00:00:30,120
and I go to the same site we were talking about in the last lecture.
9

9

00:00:30,120  -->  00:00:33,510
Now, what do you think is actually happening 
behind the scenes when I do that?
10

10

00:00:33,510  -->  00:00:37,440
If you're someone who is incredibly smart 
or you're just cheating, well, guess what?
11

11

00:00:37,440  -->  00:00:40,980
You probably know the answer, which is it's the exact same thing
12

12

00:00:40,980  -->  00:00:43,080
as when you access it through your computer.
13

13

00:00:43,080  -->  00:00:48,030
Your phone, after all, is just a (remember?), 
it's just a small computer.
14

14

00:00:48,030  -->  00:00:50,050
It's like your computer, but with a smaller screen.
15

15

00:00:50,050  -->  00:00:57,000
It uses different technology to access 
the same information, but it's roughly the same thing.
16

16

00:00:57,000  -->  00:01:02,250
So how is it exactly that the same set of 
instructions for the way my computer views
17

17

00:01:02,250  -->  00:01:08,870
the website is the same as the instructions 
for my phone to view the website?
18

18

00:01:08,870  -->  00:01:14,400
This is obviously a conundrum, right? 
Because my phone is definitely smaller.
19

19

00:01:14,400  -->  00:01:20,960
Well, the answer to that is that today, 
nowadays, mobile phones are so prolific that
20

20

00:01:20,960  -->  00:01:26,680
virtually all websites you go to are going to have, 
in that original index file that we talked about,
21

21

00:01:26,680  -->  00:01:31,100
that index file with the set of original 
instructions, it's going to include
22

22

00:01:31,100  -->  00:01:36,290
information on how to display that same 
exact information, but on a smaller screen.
23

23

00:01:36,290  -->  00:01:41,500
This concept relates to what we call responsive web design,
24

24

00:01:41,500  -->  00:01:46,020
which is a concept and a buzz word 
that we'll cover later on in the course,
25

25

00:01:46,020  -->  00:01:48,360
especially when we get to the tech trends section.
26

26

00:01:48,360  -->  00:01:52,920
Now, there is a difference between displaying 
correctly on multiple devices and being responsive,
27

27

00:01:52,920  -->  00:01:55,820
if you don't know the difference, stay tuned, we'll get to it.
28

28

00:01:55,820  -->  00:01:59,770
Ok, so mobile sites, when accessed 
through the browser, operate very much
29

29

00:01:59,770  -->  00:02:04,730
like the browser on your computer, 
it's the same interpreter viewing the same files.
30

30

00:02:04,730  -->  00:02:10,000
But now, what is then the difference between 
mobile apps and mobile websites?
31

31

00:02:10,000  -->  00:02:14,930
Two words that people constantly, even to this day, get flip-flopped.
32

32

00:02:14,930  -->  00:02:18,040
Well, I'm glad you asked that question, even though I asked it,
33

33

00:02:18,040  -->  00:02:20,570
and this is a very important distinction for you to know.
34

34

00:02:20,570  -->  00:02:27,210
You will look like an idiot if you keeping referring 
to a mobile website as a mobile app.
35

35

00:02:27,210  -->  00:02:30,580
Maybe not immediately, but 
eventually people will get sick of it,
36

36

00:02:30,580  -->  00:02:32,490
because there's a very distinct difference.
37

37

00:02:32,490  -->  00:02:35,430
To explain the difference, let's think about how we,
38

38

00:02:35,430  -->  00:02:39,660
the everyday non-technical bumpkin, use both of these.
39

39

00:02:39,660  -->  00:02:43,590
Say you wanted to look up some 
information about a local store on your phone.
40

40

00:02:43,590  -->  00:02:45,700
You would most likely what?
41

41

00:02:45,700  -->  00:02:49,570
You open up your browser, you go to 
something like Safari if you're using an iPhone,
42

42

00:02:49,570  -->  00:02:53,050
and you type in the name of the store, 
and you navigate to that site,
43

43

00:02:53,050  -->  00:02:54,570
you probably just go through Google.
44

44

00:02:54,570  -->  00:02:58,450
That operates the exact same way 
we discussed before, same process.
45

45

00:02:58,450  -->  00:03:02,420
But what if you wanted to, say, use Uber to call a ride?
46

46

00:03:02,420  -->  00:03:06,820
Well, in that case, you couldn't just go 
search for it and use their website to do it,
47

47

00:03:06,820  -->  00:03:10,860
you would actually have to go to the app on your phone, open it,
48

48

00:03:10,860  -->  00:03:13,330
and then use the features in the app to call a ride.
49

49

00:03:13,330  -->  00:03:17,100
If you don't have the app, well, guess what? 
You'll have to download it.
50

50

00:03:17,100  -->  00:03:23,660
In this case, you aren't pinging a web server 
to load a bunch of text files, it's a bit different.
51

51

00:03:23,660  -->  00:03:26,940
In this case specifically, when using an app and not a website,
52

52

00:03:26,940  -->  00:03:32,320
you actually have a lot of those files we talked 
about before already stored on your phone.
53

53

00:03:32,320  -->  00:03:35,920
So, remember that generic setup of 
web servers that we talked about?
54

54

00:03:35,920  -->  00:03:41,930
You have the index file, the backend file, a big 
box of images, and potentially like a .css file.
55

55

00:03:41,930  -->  00:03:47,890
Well, in this case, and again, this is oversimplified, 
but to get the point, the index page,
56

56

00:03:47,890  -->  00:03:52,300
the folder of files, and the equivalent of style instructions,
57

57

00:03:52,300  -->  00:03:55,300
well, they're already stored locally onto your phone,
58

58

00:03:55,300  -->  00:03:58,870
and that is actually what happens when you download an app.
59

59

00:03:58,870  -->  00:04:01,770
You download the Uber app, they're 
just going to send you the images,
60

60

00:04:01,770  -->  00:04:06,710
and the rules, and the ways that 
their app should display on the front.
61

61

00:04:06,710  -->  00:04:09,850
Right now, on your phone, you basically have a bunch of
62

62

00:04:09,850  -->  00:04:14,480
half-filled website folders, packaged together as apps.
63

63

00:04:14,480  -->  00:04:18,120
So in this case, because the files aren't being interpreted - accessed
64

64

00:04:18,120  -->  00:04:20,860
and displayed is what I mean by interpreted - through a browser,
65

65

00:04:20,860  -->  00:04:24,500
the files have to be written in a different way for your phone
66

66

00:04:24,500  -->  00:04:28,470
and its operating system to understand and then correctly display.
67

67

00:04:28,470  -->  00:04:31,670
Different systems are going to require different languages.
68

68

00:04:31,670  -->  00:04:34,710
You are essentially skipping the whole browser process entirely,
69

69

00:04:34,710  -->  00:04:37,970
and taking what the browser does, and replacing it with
70

70

00:04:37,970  -->  00:04:42,280
what a package of information called an app does.
71

71

00:04:42,280  -->  00:04:46,340
Now, the biggest difference in the app scenario is you don't have
72

72

00:04:46,340  -->  00:04:50,660
the equivalent of that backend file 
we described before on your phone.
73

73

00:04:50,660  -->  00:04:58,600
That folder is still actually out there 
on the server, most likely at some side service
74

74

00:04:58,600  -->  00:05:03,120
that Uber specifically operates, 
in the Uber example, and that is used
75

75

00:05:03,120  -->  00:05:06,970
essentially automatically to link up with the app whenever you open it.
76

76

00:05:06,970  -->  00:05:11,960
So in the package, which is the actual 
lingo for a group of files you download
77

77

00:05:11,960  -->  00:05:16,050
when you download an app, are going 
to be instructions for where to go
78

78

00:05:16,050  -->  00:05:19,690
to find that missing piece, that missing backend functionality,
79

79

00:05:19,690  -->  00:05:23,030
and then plus what to do with it once you find it.
80

80

00:05:23,030  -->  00:05:27,400
Now why is this behind the scenes 
functionality stored somewhere else?
81

81

00:05:27,400  -->  00:05:33,000
Well, because the processes it's going 
to run could be really complicated
82

82

00:05:33,000  -->  00:05:36,870
and burdensome on whatever machine is required to run them.
83

83

00:05:36,870  -->  00:05:43,600
Remember, that's why there is an advantage to 
putting your server files on a server to begin with,
84

84

00:05:43,600  -->  00:05:48,310
and that's also why the concept of RAM 
in the previous section is so important.
85

85

00:05:48,310  -->  00:05:51,350
Computers generally have a lot more RAM, they can handle this
86

86

00:05:51,350  -->  00:05:56,290
in a much better position than, say, 
your phone, which has limited specs.
87

87

00:05:56,290  -->  00:06:00,090
So if that had to run on a tiny little phone, 
it could potentially make it
88

88

00:06:00,090  -->  00:06:04,430
run really slow, and thus ruin the experience of using the app.
89

89

00:06:04,430  -->  00:06:07,580
Again, this is very much an over simplification, 
but it's the best way
90

90

00:06:07,580  -->  00:06:12,040
of conceptualizing how it works 
when you are essentially non-technical.
91

91

00:06:12,040  -->  00:06:15,310
Once you start learning more and more technical details,
92

92

00:06:15,310  -->  00:06:21,000
you'll find out that it operates quite a bit 
differently, but it's the same general idea.
93

93

00:06:21,000  -->  00:06:24,950
Ok, so again, how do mobile sites and mobile apps work?
94

94

00:06:24,950  -->  00:06:28,090
Try to explain this to yourself and then repeat it back to me.
95

95

00:06:28,090  -->  00:06:31,060
Well, it depends on which one you're talking about.
96

96

00:06:31,060  -->  00:06:35,390
Mobile websites are the same thing as pretty much any old website.
97

97

00:06:35,390  -->  00:06:41,250
It's going to use a browser to interpret and display a set of files,
98

98

00:06:41,250  -->  00:06:45,300
and the only difference is that that site 
that it's going to display, it might have
99

99

00:06:45,300  -->  00:06:48,600
different instructions for how the site should look when
100

100

00:06:48,600  -->  00:06:52,950
accessed on your phone, versus a tablet, versus a web browser.
101

101

00:06:52,950  -->  00:06:57,550
Now, on the app version, however, 
we already have those files on our phone.
102

102

00:06:57,550  -->  00:07:00,950
We're simply telling the phone to, "Hey, open these files,
103

103

00:07:00,950  -->  00:07:05,360
find the main set of instructions, and then run that way."
104

104

00:07:05,360  -->  00:07:07,850
Behind the scenes functionality gets handled
105

105

00:07:07,850  -->  00:07:11,360
on an external server, much like any other web server.
106

106

00:07:11,360  -->  00:07:15,170
So in this case, the files included in your app are made especially
107

107

00:07:15,170  -->  00:07:19,240
for your screen and only your screen, and that's why in general
108

108

00:07:19,240  -->  00:07:21,710
apps are going to look better than a mobile site.
109

109

00:07:21,710  -->  00:07:24,940
Later on in the course, we're going to get 
into the differences between apps.
110

110

00:07:24,940  -->  00:07:27,490
We're going to talk about native apps, hybrid apps,
111

111

00:07:27,490  -->  00:07:30,580
and then even what is a web app specifically.
112

112

00:07:30,580  -->  00:07:33,920
I'm sure you've heard those three before, 
but you probably didn't know that
113

113

00:07:33,920  -->  00:07:35,990
there's a pretty distinct difference between the three,
114

114

00:07:35,990  -->  00:07:39,440
and that difference is pretty important lest you, again, want to look
115

115

00:07:39,440  -->  00:07:42,690
like an idiot in front of your developer team, 
which is not what we want.
116

116

00:07:42,690  -->  00:07:45,000
All right guys, moving on to the next lecture. See you then!
