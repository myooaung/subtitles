00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.500
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:01.500  -->  00:00:04.640
So, in this lecture, we're talking about back-end languages,
3

3

00:00:04.640  -->  00:00:09.380
and specifically, Ruby, PHP, and Python.
4

4

00:00:09.380  -->  00:00:13.590
If you want to learn one of those three, what is the best way of going about it?
5

5

00:00:13.590  -->  00:00:19.550
Now, in back-end you're pretty lucky, because there's just resources everywhere.
6

6

00:00:19.550  -->  00:00:23.660
You can use quite literally every format of resource available.
7

7

00:00:23.660  -->  00:00:28.860
There are YouTube tutorials, there are books, there are online tutorials,
8

8

00:00:28.860  -->  00:00:32.900
there are online courses, there are bootcamps both online and in person,
9

9

00:00:32.900  -->  00:00:36.840
and there are full blown college classes out there.
10

10

00:00:36.840  -->  00:00:40.820
You really don't have a ton of bad options for this, just understand
11

11

00:00:40.820  -->  00:00:44.420
that this is generally a longer process than learning front-end development.
12

12

00:00:44.420  -->  00:00:46.180
All right, so let's just tackle these one at a time.
13

13

00:00:46.180  -->  00:00:50.260
So if you wanted to learn Ruby, here is an example of how you could do it.
14

14

00:00:50.260  -->  00:00:55.860
First thing I would say is try to get familiar with the syntax and how it works.
15

15

00:00:55.860  -->  00:01:00.360
It's a little bit different if you know a little bit of like PHP or Python,
16

16

00:01:00.360  -->  00:01:05.940
it just operates slightly differently with gems, and it runs in its own little environment.
17

17

00:01:05.940  -->  00:01:09.940
I would say start with Codecademy, because Codecademy will introduce you quickly
18

18

00:01:09.940  -->  00:01:13.210
and deal with all that extra setup stuff for you, so you don't have to.
19

19

00:01:13.210  -->  00:01:16.300
Past that, there are a lot of ways that you could go about this.
20

20

00:01:16.300  -->  00:01:20.390
I suggest at this point, make sure that you get familiar with the online documentation
21

21

00:01:20.390  -->  00:01:25.090
and the Ruby communities, because you're 
constantly going to have to be referring back to it,
22

22

00:01:25.090  -->  00:01:27.360
because it's a language that's constantly being updated.
23

23

00:01:27.360  -->  00:01:31.800
The next thing I'd suggest is trying something like TryRuby,
24

24

00:01:31.800  -->  00:01:35.500
that's an actual system you can use that tries to give you
25

25

00:01:35.500  -->  00:01:38.740
a holistic view of Ruby, and gives you practice problems.
26

26

00:01:38.740  -->  00:01:42.310
There's another one called RubyMonk, which is pretty decent.
27

27

00:01:42.310  -->  00:01:46.380
Once you feel like you have a decent understanding of Ruby,
28

28

00:01:46.380  -->  00:01:49.350
you can make basic things, maybe you don't know everything,
29

29

00:01:49.350  -->  00:01:53.700
then I'd say move into learning how to solve problems,
30

30

00:01:53.700  -->  00:01:55.540
and really testing your understanding.
31

31

00:01:55.540  -->  00:02:00.230
The way I would go about doing that is through something like CodeWars.
32

32

00:02:00.230  -->  00:02:06.230
CodeWars is an app online that's for Ruby, and you play it like a game,
33

33

00:02:06.230  -->  00:02:09.540
and gamifying it is actually a really cool way of learning this stuff,
34

34

00:02:09.540  -->  00:02:11.510
and really challenging your understanding.
35

35

00:02:11.510  -->  00:02:14.870
At this point, it kind of depends how you're feeling about it,
36

36

00:02:14.870  -->  00:02:17.950
there are a lot of online courses that will take you farther.
37

37

00:02:17.950  -->  00:02:24.020
OneMonth has a great Ruby course, and it's done kind of in a 30-day setup,
38

38

00:02:24.020  -->  00:02:27.250
TreeHouse has a pretty good setup as well.
39

39

00:02:27.250  -->  00:02:29.580
Whatever you do, just try to learn until you get to the point
40

40

00:02:29.580  -->  00:02:34.600
where you're pretty comfortable with Ruby and the way you set it up,
41

41

00:02:34.600  -->  00:02:37.100
put in on web servers, and launch actual sites.
42

42

00:02:37.100  -->  00:02:41.370
The next thing you would need to do is jump head first into Rails.
43

43

00:02:41.370  -->  00:02:45.700
Rails is that framework that you almost always hear with Ruby,
44

44

00:02:45.700  -->  00:02:48.100
you rarely hear Ruby, you hear Ruby on Rails.
45

45

00:02:48.100  -->  00:02:51.640
Well, guess what? Ruby without Rails is not very good.
46

46

00:02:51.640  -->  00:02:55.580
In all likelihood, if you get a job with Ruby, you're going to have to know Rails,
47

47

00:02:55.580  -->  00:02:59.450
so just think of this as phase two, learn some Rails.
48

48

00:02:59.450  -->  00:03:01.650
Now, if you want to learn Python, well,
49

49

00:03:01.650  -->  00:03:05.530
Python has a lot of options available to it as well.
50

50

00:03:05.530  -->  00:03:08.360
My favorite option is actually just use the Google course.
51

51

00:03:08.360  -->  00:03:12.420
Google has an online course for learning Python, it's really well done.
52

52

00:03:12.420  -->  00:03:16.150
Codecademy is also great for just beginning with Python,
53

53

00:03:16.150  -->  00:03:19.440
although I think it's kind of undersimplified.
54

54

00:03:19.440  -->  00:03:21.170
Other options, Coursera.
55

55

00:03:21.170  -->  00:03:25.300
If you're not familiar with Coursera, it's college courses put online,
56

56

00:03:25.300  -->  00:03:28.370
and you take them in the same format as a college course.
57

57

00:03:28.370  -->  00:03:32.420
Since Python is the most popular language taught in universities,
58

58

00:03:32.420  -->  00:03:35.850
there's a lot of courses on it, and there are really good ones on there.
59

59

00:03:35.850  -->  00:03:41.800
And then, like Ruby, you'd probably need to learn some form of a framework
60

60

00:03:41.800  -->  00:03:46.160
after you take one of those, and it really depends on what you're trying to do.
61

61

00:03:46.160  -->  00:03:49.030
If you're trying to do web development, I'd suggest learning Django,
62

62

00:03:49.030  -->  00:03:53.540
because that's probably the most commonly used framework for Python,
63

63

00:03:53.540  -->  00:03:56.270
but if you want to do something like data science,
64

64

00:03:56.270  -->  00:04:01.880
or work on graphic visualizations, there's different ones out there.
65

65

00:04:01.880  -->  00:04:05.250
If you're learning Python for a specific reason, like, say, web scraping,
66

66

00:04:05.250  -->  00:04:08.190
there's a great framework for Python called Scrapy.
67

67

00:04:08.190  -->  00:04:10.520
You just need to figure out "Why am I doing this?"
68

68

00:04:10.520  -->  00:04:12.490
and then look for an appropriate framework.
69

69

00:04:12.490  -->  00:04:18.000
The last one is PHP, and PHP, again, huge community, it's all pretty much free,
70

70

00:04:18.000  -->  00:04:20.300
so there's a lot of different ways you can go out and learn it.
71

71

00:04:20.300  -->  00:04:24.400
One thing I will point out is make sure that you're learning the most recent PHP,
72

72

00:04:24.400  -->  00:04:27.540
because they've been making a lot of changes in the last two rounds.
73

73

00:04:27.540  -->  00:04:30.280
Now, one thing to keep in mind with PHP is actually that
74

74

00:04:30.280  -->  00:04:33.600
you need to understand basic HTML and CSS.
75

75

00:04:33.600  -->  00:04:35.480
One of the biggest advantages of PHP is that
76

76

00:04:35.480  -->  00:04:38.580
you can insert it directly into the HTML page,
77

77

00:04:38.580  -->  00:04:42.250
so if you don't actually know how to manipulate those two very basic languages,
78

78

00:04:42.250  -->  00:04:43.900
you're actually leaving a lot on the table.
79

79

00:04:43.900  -->  00:04:47.230
As far as getting started, Codecademy again, great option,
80

80

00:04:47.230  -->  00:04:50.330
Udemy actually has a lot of good courses on PHP.
81

81

00:04:50.330  -->  00:04:56.100
Past that, I'd actually suggest using books, O'Reilly has a really good book on PHP,
82

82

00:04:56.100  -->  00:05:00.670
because it focuses on building applications 
first, and you get to build lots of applications
83

83

00:05:00.670  -->  00:05:02.340
that are actually funny and somewhat memorable.
84

84

00:05:02.340  -->  00:05:06.300
After that, I would strongly suggest learning how to use PHP
85

85

00:05:06.300  -->  00:05:12.370
in an object oriented way, OOP, it gives me nightmares to this day,
86

86

00:05:12.370  -->  00:05:14.980
but I strongly suggest you understand how to use that, because again,
87

87

00:05:14.980  -->  00:05:17.320
that's going to give you the best control of PHP.
88

88

00:05:17.320  -->  00:05:20.990
Doing PHP procedurally is ok if you want to be a hacker,
89

89

00:05:20.990  -->  00:05:24.270
but if you actually want to build things that people will pay you for,
90

90

00:05:24.270  -->  00:05:29.230
then I would strongly suggest learning how to use that, it's called a paradigm.
91

91

00:05:29.230  -->  00:05:30.860
All right, so that pretty much sums up those three.
92

92

00:05:30.860  -->  00:05:33.300
I'm not going to cover Java, because - just Google it,
93

93

00:05:33.300  -->  00:05:36.910
Java is just not really something I'm going to endorse at this moment,
94

94

00:05:36.910  -->  00:05:41.050
the other ones are relatively simple, just keep in mind how they work.
95

95

00:05:41.050  -->  00:05:45.250
Ruby is for the web, so focus on, make sure that you understand Rails.
96

96

00:05:45.250  -->  00:05:48.920
Python you can learn on Coursera, in college courses,
97

97

00:05:48.920  -->  00:05:51.950
you can learn it online through Google's course,
98

98

00:05:51.950  -->  00:05:55.300
and then PHP is free and it's everywhere, and surprisingly
99

99

00:05:55.300  -->  00:05:58.300
the books available for learning it are pretty good.
100

100

00:05:58.300  -->  00:06:01.450
All right guys, that wraps up the back-end section of choosing your path.
101

101

00:06:01.450  -->  00:06:02.500
See you in the next lecture!
