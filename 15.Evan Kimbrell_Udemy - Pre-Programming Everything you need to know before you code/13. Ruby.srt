00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,600
And we are back.
2

2

00:00:01,600  -->  00:00:04,780
All right, wrapping up on our tour of need to know
3

3

00:00:04,780  -->  00:00:08,070
back-end languages is the new kid on the block, Ruby.
4

4

00:00:08,070  -->  00:00:10,440
Ruby, you may or may not have heard of.
5

5

00:00:10,440  -->  00:00:15,680
It's popular, it's new, and as a result 
of that, it's a bit controversial.
6

6

00:00:15,680  -->  00:00:18,760
Let's get into a little bit about what makes it so different.
7

7

00:00:18,760  -->  00:00:20,600
The biggest thing you need to know about Ruby is that
8

8

00:00:20,600  -->  00:00:23,340
it was designed with one thing in mind, and that's speed.
9

9

00:00:23,340  -->  00:00:27,330
That is most often what you hear from 
people when they try to justify using it.
10

10

00:00:27,330  -->  00:00:30,930
Inside the language system itself, it includes a lot of automation
11

11

00:00:30,930  -->  00:00:34,400
and intuitive changes that save time for the average developer.
12

12

00:00:34,400  -->  00:00:37,860
It's frequently touted as an app that you can learn to create
13

13

00:00:37,860  -->  00:00:41,910
a relatively complicated application in in a very short period of time.
14

14

00:00:41,910  -->  00:00:45,210
Whether or not this is actually true is kind of hard to say.
15

15

00:00:45,210  -->  00:00:48,610
One thing that is true is that it's the cool new kid in town.
16

16

00:00:48,610  -->  00:00:52,180
They just moved here and nobody knows 
enough about them to know their history,
17

17

00:00:52,180  -->  00:00:54,990
but their newness and mystery is intriguing.
18

18

00:00:54,990  -->  00:00:56,750
Yeah, that's basically Ruby.
19

19

00:00:56,750  -->  00:01:02,460
Ruby actually got started back in 1993, but 
didn't come out and get popular until much later.
20

20

00:01:02,460  -->  00:01:06,040
So the upsides you need to know is 
that it's fast, it's new, and it's trendy.
21

21

00:01:06,040  -->  00:01:08,070
So what exactly are the downsides?
22

22

00:01:08,070  -->  00:01:12,130
Well, one major downside of Ruby is the size of the community.
23

23

00:01:12,130  -->  00:01:15,600
Its newness means it had less time to gather a following.
24

24

00:01:15,600  -->  00:01:20,550
Combine that with its popularity and demand, 
and you have a recipe for some issues.
25

25

00:01:20,550  -->  00:01:24,150
High demand, low supply means prices for Ruby developers
26

26

00:01:24,150  -->  00:01:26,650
are often some of the highest you'll find out there.
27

27

00:01:26,650  -->  00:01:30,590
It also means that the most people are trying to transition into it,
28

28

00:01:30,590  -->  00:01:35,630
which means it has the largest glut of 
inexperienced junior developers using it.
29

29

00:01:35,630  -->  00:01:38,460
Very hard to get someone who has eight years of experience
30

30

00:01:38,460  -->  00:01:42,000
using Ruby if it's really only been popular for four years.
31

31

00:01:42,000  -->  00:01:43,810
The other downside is simply structural.
32

32

00:01:43,810  -->  00:01:47,840
For whatever reason, it has this notoriety attached to it that
33

33

00:01:47,840  -->  00:01:51,780
it has poor performance when used for larger and larger systems.
34

34

00:01:51,780  -->  00:01:53,780
So what about Ruby do you actually need to know?
35

35

00:01:53,780  -->  00:01:59,350
Well, it's designed to be fast and can theoretically 
save you development time, hence its popularity.
36

36

00:01:59,350  -->  00:02:03,690
It's relatively easy to use and setup, 
and it's kind of the "in" language right now.
37

37

00:02:03,690  -->  00:02:07,660
Etsy uses it, Airbnb uses it, Shopify uses it.
38

38

00:02:07,660  -->  00:02:10,000
There's a strange glamour to it.
39

39

00:02:10,000  -->  00:02:13,730
The flipside is just that it's young, which means 
it's underdeveloped in its community,
40

40

00:02:13,730  -->  00:02:17,940
and has a small pool of talent that you 
can pick from if you want to use Ruby.
41

41

00:02:17,940  -->  00:02:22,410
Some companies like Groupon used Ruby and, 
because they grew so abnormally fast,
42

42

00:02:22,410  -->  00:02:25,880
ran into immense problems hiring and scaling.
43

43

00:02:25,880  -->  00:02:27,730
All right guys, so that's what you should know about Ruby.
44

44

00:02:27,730  -->  00:02:30,080
Keep that in mind, and I'll see you in the next lecture!
