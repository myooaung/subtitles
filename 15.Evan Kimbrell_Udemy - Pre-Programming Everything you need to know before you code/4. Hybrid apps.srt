00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,110
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,110  -->  00:00:06,750
So, the next tech trend we're going to cover is what's called a hybrid app.
3

3

00:00:06,750  -->  00:00:11,040
Now, in general, when you hear me say app, I'm probably talking about mobile apps,
4

4

00:00:11,040  -->  00:00:13,780
it's just kind of a short form, and if I say application,
5

5

00:00:13,780  -->  00:00:15,650
I'm probably talking about something on the web.
6

6

00:00:15,650  -->  00:00:18,150
Now, if you remember from before, we covered very briefly
7

7

00:00:18,150  -->  00:00:21,090
what the three types of mobile apps are.
8

8

00:00:21,090  -->  00:00:26,920
The first one is native, and native basically means that the app was written
9

9

00:00:26,920  -->  00:00:33,600
in the code that the mobile operating system essentially recognizes and accepts,
10

10

00:00:33,600  -->  00:00:37,740
so if you're making a native app for iOS, it's going to be in Objective C,
11

11

00:00:37,740  -->  00:00:39,840
if you're doing it for Android, you have to write it in Java.
12

12

00:00:39,840  -->  00:00:44,070
The second type is what's just called a web app, which is essentially
13

13

00:00:44,070  -->  00:00:52,020
just a website shrunk down, and partially redesigned to fit and work on a smaller screen,
14

14

00:00:52,020  -->  00:00:54,660
and then often times that will be then taken
15

15

00:00:54,660  -->  00:00:59,000
and put into a package that can be used like an app.
16

16

00:00:59,000  -->  00:01:02,830
A lot of people don't even notice this, but there are web apps on your phone,
17

17

00:01:02,830  -->  00:01:06,440
and when you press the button to open the app, it just takes you to a web page.
18

18

00:01:06,440  -->  00:01:10,110
The third type of app out there is what's called a hybrid app
19

19

00:01:10,110  -->  00:01:13,000
and it's something that kind of straddles the fence.
20

20

00:01:13,000  -->  00:01:16,110
Now, the basic idea behind hybrid apps is that most people and companies
21

21

00:01:16,110  -->  00:01:19,580
are probably going to want to make a mobile app
22

22

00:01:19,580  -->  00:01:22,220
for as many operating systems as they can,
23

23

00:01:22,220  -->  00:01:24,990
and that often means that they end up spending a lot of time,
24

24

00:01:24,990  -->  00:01:30,200
and building out, and hiring different resources for different operating systems.
25

25

00:01:30,200  -->  00:01:32,160
So the basic thinking behind the hybrid apps is
26

26

00:01:32,160  -->  00:01:38,800
"Why make three apps, Windows Phone, iOS, 
and Android, if you could just make one?"
27

27

00:01:38,800  -->  00:01:40,700
And that is what a hybrid app is.
28

28

00:01:40,700  -->  00:01:45,340
A hybrid app is an app that you write in basic web code,
29

29

00:01:45,340  -->  00:01:48,580
that then goes into a system such as Phone Gap,
30

30

00:01:48,580  -->  00:01:54,210
which basically acts as a compiler that takes that code, compiles it,
31

31

00:01:54,210  -->  00:01:57,950
and then interprets it in a way that every single
32

32

00:01:57,950  -->  00:02:00,290
mobile operating system can actually understand.
33

33

00:02:00,290  -->  00:02:02,260
Now that seems like a great deal, right?
34

34

00:02:02,260  -->  00:02:05,830
Why would I spend all the time and resources to make
35

35

00:02:05,830  -->  00:02:08,000
all these different apps when I can just make one?
36

36

00:02:08,000  -->  00:02:11,500
Well, it's because there's actual downsides to it.
37

37

00:02:11,500  -->  00:02:14,000
There's two main downsides to hybrid apps.
38

38

00:02:14,000  -->  00:02:16,100
The first downside is interactivity.
39

39

00:02:16,100  -->  00:02:20,950
Because you're writing essentially in web code, and then you're compiling it,
40

40

00:02:20,950  -->  00:02:25,680
it's harder to control the finished product that comes out,
41

41

00:02:25,680  -->  00:02:30,320
and also the systems right now are kind of underdeveloped.
42

42

00:02:30,320  -->  00:02:33,020
And when I say interactivity, what do I mean?
43

43

00:02:33,020  -->  00:02:38,020
I mean actual movements, popups, motions, those kind of things,
44

44

00:02:38,020  -->  00:02:41,070
the things that have become really popular in the last 4-5 years.
45

45

00:02:41,070  -->  00:02:43,970
I don't know if you ever noticed this, but go to Facebook.
46

46

00:02:43,970  -->  00:02:46,500
Go to your Facebook app right now, open it.
47

47

00:02:46,500  -->  00:02:49,910
What you'll notice is when you press buttons,
48

48

00:02:49,910  -->  00:02:52,700
often times it just looks more seamless,
49

49

00:02:52,700  -->  00:02:54,510
when you press a button, it might depress,
50

50

00:02:54,510  -->  00:02:57,900
and then you might see a smooth motion come up, and pop open.
51

51

00:02:57,900  -->  00:03:01,450
If you ever opened the Twitter app, it shows the icon Twitter,
52

52

00:03:01,450  -->  00:03:05,160
and then it just zooms out, and then you see your homepage.
53

53

00:03:05,160  -->  00:03:08,390
Those two are examples of native applications.
54

54

00:03:08,390  -->  00:03:11,000
Now go and look at something like Netflix.
55

55

00:03:11,000  -->  00:03:14,590
Netflix is actually a hybrid app, and you can kind of tell
56

56

00:03:14,590  -->  00:03:17,570
by just navigating through it and pressing buttons.
57

57

00:03:17,570  -->  00:03:20,510
It just doesn't feel the same, and it doesn't respond
58

58

00:03:20,510  -->  00:03:23,710
the same way to the other apps you're used to.
59

59

00:03:23,710  -->  00:03:26,340
The second downside to hybrid apps is with hybrid apps
60

60

00:03:26,340  -->  00:03:30,500
it's harder to control basic core functions of the phone itself.
61

61

00:03:30,500  -->  00:03:35,210
So it's harder to do things like dial a phone number, send a text,
62

62

00:03:35,210  -->  00:03:39,060
or save and retrieve images on the hard drive of the phone.
63

63

00:03:39,060  -->  00:03:42,190
The only reason why that is is just because systems like Phone Gap
64

64

00:03:42,190  -->  00:03:46,890
are relatively undeveloped, and every year they're getting a lot better,
65

65

00:03:46,890  -->  00:03:50,350
so next year I wouldn't be surprised if that's not even a problem anymore.
66

66

00:03:50,350  -->  00:03:51,300
So that's really it.
67

67

00:03:51,300  -->  00:03:53,810
Hybrid apps are apps that are written in one language,
68

68

00:03:53,810  -->  00:03:58,370
stuck through a program that then translates it for every single platform.
69

69

00:03:58,370  -->  00:04:01,380
It saves you a lot of time and money,
70

70

00:04:01,380  -->  00:04:06,120
but you end up giving up full control over the app,
71

71

00:04:06,120  -->  00:04:11,760
and in general, it doesn't perform the same way, so the user experience often suffers.
72

72

00:04:11,760  -->  00:04:16,160
Also worth noting that there are hybrid apps that work on desktops.
73

73

00:04:16,160  -->  00:04:17,150
What do I mean by that?
74

74

00:04:17,150  -->  00:04:23,470
I mean web apps, like your Gmail, or going to, say, Slack, that work in your browser,
75

75

00:04:23,470  -->  00:04:27,430
but also then work on your desktop, not accessed through a browser.
76

76

00:04:27,430  -->  00:04:28,870
A great example is actually Slack.
77

77

00:04:28,870  -->  00:04:32,840
If you look at Slack, they did not make their app
78

78

00:04:32,840  -->  00:04:36,820
in the native language for either Windows or OS X.
79

79

00:04:36,820  -->  00:04:40,550
What they did was use a hybrid app system,
80

80

00:04:40,550  -->  00:04:43,880
not worth getting into the specifics, but I'll post it in the resources.
81

81

00:04:43,880  -->  00:04:47,460
That whole process was kind of kicked off by a thing called Adobe Air,
82

82

00:04:47,460  -->  00:04:52,130
which essentially was kind of the first system that would take web apps,
83

83

00:04:52,130  -->  00:04:57,540
compile them, and interpret them for your desktop, same way like a Phone Gap works.
84

84

00:04:57,540  -->  00:05:02,030
All right guys, that's basically what you need to understand about hybrid apps.
85

85

00:05:02,030  -->  00:05:07,850
Upside, cheap and fast, downside, you lose some on the user experience,
86

86

00:05:07,850  -->  00:05:13,650
and also, hey, we have hybrid apps all over, you just need to get used to spotting them.
87

87

00:05:13,650  -->  00:05:15,210
All right, see you in the next lecture!
