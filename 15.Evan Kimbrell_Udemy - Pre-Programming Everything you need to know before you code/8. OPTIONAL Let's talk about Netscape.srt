00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,540
Hey hey hey, welcome back.
2

2

00:00:01,540  -->  00:00:06,840
Ok, first off, I want you to know 
that this lecture is entirely optional.
3

3

00:00:06,840  -->  00:00:10,070
We're just going to geek out a little bit 
about the history of browsers and
4

4

00:00:10,070  -->  00:00:13,210
why we care about this little old browser called Netscape.
5

5

00:00:13,210  -->  00:00:15,480
If you really don't care, then just skip the lecture,
6

6

00:00:15,480  -->  00:00:17,280
see you in the next section, doesn't hurt my feelings.
7

7

00:00:17,280  -->  00:00:21,450
You don't need to know this stuff to be 
effective at what you do, but who knows?
8

8

00:00:21,450  -->  00:00:24,160
There might be a trivia night where you get a Netscape question
9

9

00:00:24,160  -->  00:00:26,800
and you win some chicken poppers for the team.
10

10

00:00:26,800  -->  00:00:30,460
So what is Netscape and why should we care about it?
11

11

00:00:30,460  -->  00:00:33,670
Ok, so back in the old, old days, when people used to hear
12

12

00:00:33,670  -->  00:00:35,670
this noise when they connected to the internet,
13

13

00:00:38,000  -->  00:00:42,000
back then, browsers were a 
very new concept, as was the internet.
14

14

00:00:42,000  -->  00:00:46,100
The internet in its infancy was just a loose gathering of websites
15

15

00:00:46,100  -->  00:00:51,920
that were not connected to each other, 
basic in function, and impossible to find.
16

16

00:00:51,920  -->  00:00:55,970
Remember, this is pre-Google. A lot of people, 
still back then, thought that the internet
17

17

00:00:55,970  -->  00:01:01,390
was just a novelty, and Newsweek magazine 
famously proclaimed that "The Internet is Dead".
18

18

00:01:01,390  -->  00:01:06,400
Newsweek never again made that mistake. 
Except for the other, like, ten times.
19

19

00:01:06,400  -->  00:01:11,580
Netscape was, for all intents and purposes, 
the first commercially available browser.
20

20

00:01:11,580  -->  00:01:16,000
They were the first browser to have 
a monetization scheme and thus actually
21

21

00:01:16,000  -->  00:01:21,250
had money to invest in making their system, 
and by association, make the internet better.
22

22

00:01:21,250  -->  00:01:26,690
The first browser ever was actually 
called Mosaic, but it was very prototypical,
23

23

00:01:26,690  -->  00:01:30,690
and much like the model we see 
with a lot of obscure browsers today.
24

24

00:01:30,690  -->  00:01:34,460
It was an open source system that many 
people contributed to, but there was
25

25

00:01:34,460  -->  00:01:39,770
no centralized source of effort iterating on it 
and investing money and effort towards it.
26

26

00:01:39,770  -->  00:01:42,640
Netscape did three things that changed the internet forever.
27

27

00:01:42,640  -->  00:01:47,130
One, they invented a new language 
called LiveScript, that allowed websites
28

28

00:01:47,130  -->  00:01:52,210
to have a much richer functionality. Prior to 
this point, websites were very, very basic.
29

29

00:01:52,210  -->  00:01:56,000
LiveScript later became... anyone?
30

30

00:01:56,000  -->  00:01:56,960
JavaScript.
31

31

00:01:56,960  -->  00:02:03,060
And as we know now and will explain later, 
JavaScript may or may not be eating the entire world.
32

32

00:02:03,060  -->  00:02:08,170
The second thing they did invent, which 
is a game changer, was what's called SSL.
33

33

00:02:08,170  -->  00:02:12,970
Remember how we talked about the main way 
that computers transfer internet related data?
34

34

00:02:12,970  -->  00:02:15,700
Remember? It was called the TCP/IP.
35

35

00:02:15,700  -->  00:02:20,940
As it turns out, that unnecessarily long 
acronym was really easy to hack
36

36

00:02:20,940  -->  00:02:24,880
and it had essentially no way of 
preventing information passing through it
37

37

00:02:24,880  -->  00:02:28,710
without being intercepted and understood by Russian hackers.
38

38

00:02:28,710  -->  00:02:33,340
So, enter SSL, which stood for Secure Sockets Layer.
39

39

00:02:33,340  -->  00:02:36,850
What it did, quite simply, was that it encrypted the traffic
40

40

00:02:36,850  -->  00:02:40,490
that was being passed through that TCP/IP protocol.
41

41

00:02:40,490  -->  00:02:43,490
It would then un-encrypt it on the client machine,
42

42

00:02:43,490  -->  00:02:45,830
assuming that's where the information was meant to go.
43

43

00:02:45,830  -->  00:02:51,380
SSL opened up a whole new world, if you haven't yet 
made the connection to why it's so important.
44

44

00:02:51,380  -->  00:02:56,380
All of a sudden, the internet, which up 
until this point was about as complicated
45

45

00:02:56,380  -->  00:03:00,210
as the modern day Craigslist, it got a whole lot more useful.
46

46

00:03:00,210  -->  00:03:04,010
With Netscape, you could buy things online
47

47

00:03:04,010  -->  00:03:06,730
without worrying about people stealing your information.
48

48

00:03:06,730  -->  00:03:11,000
The last thing that Netscape did, 
and arguably the most important thing it did,
49

49

00:03:11,000  -->  00:03:13,630
was that it launched what we call the browser wars.
50

50

00:03:13,630  -->  00:03:18,970
As we all know, when companies fight 
over customers, we the customers usually win.
51

51

00:03:18,970  -->  00:03:23,030
Unless it's Comcast, because they 
will always find a way to screw you over.
52

52

00:03:23,030  -->  00:03:28,000
Netscape turned a young Bill Gates internet crazy, and, as a result,
53

53

00:03:28,000  -->  00:03:33,020
Microsoft launched the browser that 
today everyone hates, Internet Explorer.
54

54

00:03:33,020  -->  00:03:36,720
That's it. Without Netscape, who knows 
where the internet would be today?
55

55

00:03:36,720  -->  00:03:40,480
They figured out a way to make 
websites significantly more interactive
56

56

00:03:40,480  -->  00:03:44,760
at a time where most people thought the 
internet didn't really have much potential,
57

57

00:03:44,760  -->  00:03:48,690
and they invented the first way to 
securely operate online, which enabled
58

58

00:03:48,690  -->  00:03:53,570
the first e-commerce websites, and then 
last of all, it poked the eye of the reigning
59

59

00:03:53,570  -->  00:03:59,780
tech giant Microsoft into creating a competing 
project that advanced the internet even further.
60

60

00:03:59,780  -->  00:04:04,280
So what happened to Netscape and this 
very eccentric founder, known as Marc Andreessen?
61

61

00:04:04,280  -->  00:04:08,550
Well, Netscape, they got destroyed and eventually folded.
62

62

00:04:08,550  -->  00:04:15,740
Turns out, back in the 90s, everyone used a PC, 
and that meant that everyone used Windows,
63

63

00:04:15,740  -->  00:04:19,000
which meant that all Microsoft really had to do was
64

64

00:04:19,000  -->  00:04:22,570
include their own browser in their operating system.
65

65

00:04:22,570  -->  00:04:26,370
Netscape really couldn't compete with that and they folded.
66

66

00:04:26,370  -->  00:04:30,540
Microsoft then went on to get sued for what was pretty obviously
67

67

00:04:30,540  -->  00:04:35,780
an illegal use of monopolistic behavior, and the rest is history.
68

68

00:04:35,780  -->  00:04:40,150
Eventually, a bunch of nerds at Google 
wanted to create a browser-based email,
69

69

00:04:40,150  -->  00:04:43,180
but they weren't really happy 
with the current options of browsers,
70

70

00:04:43,180  -->  00:04:45,480
and thus Google Chrome was born.
71

71

00:04:45,480  -->  00:04:46,580
Hurray for history!
72

72

00:04:46,580  -->  00:04:48,590
Ok, I'll see you guys in the next lecture.
