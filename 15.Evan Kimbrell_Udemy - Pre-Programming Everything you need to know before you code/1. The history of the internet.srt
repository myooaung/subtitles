00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:01,900
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:01,900  -->  00:00:05,100
All right, so let's get into a subject 
that everybody thinks they know,
3

3

00:00:05,100  -->  00:00:07,900
but in reality very few people actually know.
4

4

00:00:07,900  -->  00:00:09,400
What subject is that, you ask?
5

5

00:00:09,400  -->  00:00:13,100
Well, it's how does the internet actually work?
6

6

00:00:13,100  -->  00:00:16,750
And no, "Open Google Chrome" is not how the internet works.
7

7

00:00:16,750  -->  00:00:19,310
But before we actually jump into that, one quick note.
8

8

00:00:19,310  -->  00:00:24,100
Why do you need to know this 
as a developer or as someone who
9

9

00:00:24,100  -->  00:00:26,290
plans to interact with developers?
10

10

00:00:26,290  -->  00:00:28,220
Well, it's actually quite simple.
11

11

00:00:28,220  -->  00:00:30,760
The internet is not perfect, and it breaks.
12

12

00:00:30,760  -->  00:00:34,400
And when something goes wrong, 
are you going to know how to fix it?
13

13

00:00:34,400  -->  00:00:39,040
When your website goes down, say, 
because the DNS is not done propagating,
14

14

00:00:39,040  -->  00:00:42,370
what are you going to do if you 
don't even know what the DNS is?
15

15

00:00:42,370  -->  00:00:46,980
Also, worth noting is that understanding 
the basics of how the internet works
16

16

00:00:46,980  -->  00:00:51,630
is actually very helpful for understanding 
online industries in general and
17

17

00:00:51,630  -->  00:00:55,790
understanding the broader trends 
that affect our lives every single day.
18

18

00:00:55,790  -->  00:00:58,090
You don't know what net neutrality is?
19

19

00:00:58,090  -->  00:01:02,660
Well, yeah, you kind of have to understand 
the basics of how the internet works first.
20

20

00:01:02,660  -->  00:01:05,800
Anyways, let's start with a little history lesson.
21

21

00:01:05,800  -->  00:01:07,900
Do you know who invented the internet?
22

22

00:01:07,900  -->  00:01:13,000
No, it wasn't Al Gore and I don't even 
know how that rumor got started.
23

23

00:01:13,000  -->  00:01:17,840
The most official and credible sources of 
information point to a research project
24

24

00:01:17,840  -->  00:01:21,710
created by the group called DARPA, D-A-R-P-A,
25

25

00:01:21,710  -->  00:01:25,880
which stands for Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency.
26

26

00:01:25,880  -->  00:01:30,340
Creepy and vague, they are responsible 
for a lot of things you hear about today
27

27

00:01:30,340  -->  00:01:33,230
that make you go "What? Really".
28

28

00:01:33,230  -->  00:01:37,960
Yes, besides making mind controlled limbs 
- I can actually thank them for that one
29

29

00:01:37,960  -->  00:01:43,580
- robot exoskeletons, submarines that can fly, 
and creepy robots that can walk
30

30

00:01:43,580  -->  00:01:48,070
and kind of balance like humans, they also 
made the first version of the internet.
31

31

00:01:48,070  -->  00:01:50,870
Needless to say, interesting group of people.
32

32

00:01:50,870  -->  00:01:56,180
Sometime in the 1960s, DARPA created 
a well-known project called ARPANET,
33

33

00:01:56,180  -->  00:02:01,740
which, I know, is not very original and also 
really hard to pronounce, ARPANET.
34

34

00:02:01,740  -->  00:02:07,090
The idea was to connect one computer 
to another through vast distances of space.
35

35

00:02:09,680  -->  00:02:14,070
So in 1969 they managed to do this 
by setting up the first computer in UCLA,
36

36

00:02:14,070  -->  00:02:16,430
and the second one in Stanford.
37

37

00:02:16,430  -->  00:02:20,570
With these two attached, they sent 
the world's first computer message,
38

38

00:02:20,570  -->  00:02:27,750
and I'm not actually making this up, 
the first message was just two letters: L - O.
39

39

00:02:27,750  -->  00:02:31,350
Was that some mystery code sent by a secret agent?
40

40

00:02:31,350  -->  00:02:37,220
No, actually it was just a clueless Stanford 
student who didn't know what they were doing,
41

41

00:02:37,220  -->  00:02:41,920
and accidentally crashed the machine 
while trying to type "LOGIN".
42

42

00:02:41,920  -->  00:02:43,470
#inspiration
43

43

00:02:43,470  -->  00:02:48,300
Over the next decades and with the coming of 
smaller, non-room sized computers,
44

44

00:02:48,300  -->  00:02:52,830
DARPA needed to create a more efficient way 
for computers to communicate with each other.
45

45

00:02:52,830  -->  00:02:57,770
This system, and it's something you're undoubtedly 
going to see mentioned somewhere,
46

46

00:02:57,770  -->  00:03:06,450
was the Transfer Control Protocol and the 
Internet Protocol, abbreviated as TCP/IP.
47

47

00:03:06,450  -->  00:03:10,520
Ok, you really don't need to know 
the specifics of this unless you get into
48

48

00:03:10,520  -->  00:03:18,180
actual hardware and IT, but just know that TCP/IP 
is the protocol that computers use
49

49

00:03:18,180  -->  00:03:22,330
to transfer information to and 
from servers and other computers.
50

50

00:03:22,330  -->  00:03:27,020
TCP is just a system for breaking up 
data into "packets", which are basically
51

51

00:03:27,020  -->  00:03:30,910
small batched chunks of information optimized for transfer,
52

52

00:03:30,910  -->  00:03:35,950
and IP is a series of numbers that tells 
that information where are you going.
53

53

00:03:35,950  -->  00:03:40,580
You smarties out there might notice that 
IP sounds a whole lot like IP address,
54

54

00:03:40,580  -->  00:03:42,550
which we'll talk about in second.
55

55

00:03:42,550  -->  00:03:46,800
Up until the 1980s, it's worth knowing that 
the Internet was really only used for
56

56

00:03:46,800  -->  00:03:50,060
transferring research between research institutions.
57

57

00:03:50,060  -->  00:03:54,570
Now, this might blow your mind, 
or you might not just care at all,
58

58

00:03:54,570  -->  00:03:59,970
but the World Wide Web, which stands for WWW, 
is actually not the same thing as the internet.
59

59

00:03:59,970  -->  00:04:04,610
You know that WWW you put before 
every website you want to go to?
60

60

00:04:04,610  -->  00:04:08,340
That stands for World Wide Web. 
Let me explain.
61

61

00:04:08,340  -->  00:04:10,650
So let's just step back just a second.
62

62

00:04:10,650  -->  00:04:15,480
The word "internet" that we've been talking 
about is actually just a variation
63

63

00:04:15,480  -->  00:04:18,590
of the original word, which is intranet.
64

64

00:04:18,590  -->  00:04:23,690
An intranet is just a connection of machines that are all "local"
65

65

00:04:23,690  -->  00:04:29,170
and connected either directly to each other 
or directly to a hub and then to each other.
66

66

00:04:29,170  -->  00:04:31,900
If you've ever heard of the term LAN, spelled L-A-N,
67

67

00:04:31,900  -->  00:04:37,170
that's exactly what LAN is - it stands for Local Access Network.
68

68

00:04:37,170  -->  00:04:39,680
If you ever played video games 
you might have heard someone say
69

69

00:04:39,680  -->  00:04:44,410
"Me and my super cool friends are going to 
drink Mountain Dew and have a LAN party".
70

70

00:04:44,410  -->  00:04:48,080
I can make fun of it because that was 
actually me for several years of my life.
71

71

00:04:48,080  -->  00:04:53,260
So if a LAN is connected to another LAN 
- that's to say one group of connected devices
72

72

00:04:53,260  -->  00:04:57,090
is then connected to another group of connected devices,
73

73

00:04:57,090  -->  00:05:02,330
through an intermediary linking them - well, that 
right there is technically called an internet.
74

74

00:05:02,330  -->  00:05:04,500
Why exactly is that different?
75

75

00:05:04,500  -->  00:05:08,210
I don't know and I suggest you 
don't think about it too hard.
76

76

00:05:08,210  -->  00:05:13,580
It has mostly to do with distances and 
connecting hubs of computers to each other.
77

77

00:05:13,580  -->  00:05:16,750
Ok, that's a roundabout explanation to get back to
78

78

00:05:16,750  -->  00:05:19,380
why World Wide Web is something entirely different.
79

79

00:05:19,380  -->  00:05:24,790
Well, see, the thing with the internet is that 
in order for computers to transfer information
80

80

00:05:24,790  -->  00:05:30,130
from each other to each other, they need 
to have the same hardware and software.
81

81

00:05:30,130  -->  00:05:35,100
Just like how I can't send a WhatsApp message 
through Facebook Messenger,
82

82

00:05:35,100  -->  00:05:40,840
you back in the day couldn't send your 
LO message to another computer
83

83

00:05:40,840  -->  00:05:46,510
if it wasn't built or capable of receiving 
that specific type of information.
84

84

00:05:46,510  -->  00:05:51,050
The World Wide Web, on the other hand, was 
something developed to skip over that problem.
85

85

00:05:51,050  -->  00:05:55,900
It created a unified system whereby all 
computers, regardless of technology,
86

86

00:05:55,900  -->  00:05:58,120
could access and transfer the same information.
87

87

00:05:58,120  -->  00:06:01,260
The Internet, as you might have heard 
me joke, is just a series of tubes.
88

88

00:06:01,260  -->  00:06:03,120
* It's a series of tubes *
89

89

00:06:03,120  -->  00:06:08,330
Well, not literally, but it is a series of 
dumb boxes and wires connecting them.
90

90

00:06:08,330  -->  00:06:11,930
The World Wide Web, or what you would just call the "web"
91

91

00:06:11,930  -->  00:06:18,810
is built on top of that and acts as a standardization 
system for sending and processing information.
92

92

00:06:18,810  -->  00:06:22,310
One of the ways that it does this is through HTTP protocol,
93

93

00:06:22,310  -->  00:06:25,640
which essentially acts as a language for coding information
94

94

00:06:25,640  -->  00:06:28,620
in that every computer on the planet can understand.
95

95

00:06:28,620  -->  00:06:32,920
Ok, so when you go to Domino's to 
order a pizza, you type in what?
96

96

00:06:32,920  -->  00:06:38,360
http://www.dominospizza.com
97

97

00:06:38,360  -->  00:06:43,470
By typing in that HTTP, we are just telling 
the computer how to communicate.
98

98

00:06:43,470  -->  00:06:46,000
Nowadays it's kind of redundant, 
we don't even know why we do it.
99

99

00:06:46,000  -->  00:06:51,580
HTTP specifies the protocol with which 
to transfer this specific information,
100

100

00:06:51,580  -->  00:06:55,510
and WWW tells your computer where to start looking.
101

101

00:06:55,510  -->  00:06:58,300
Guess what? We are halfway through the browser bar,
102

102

00:06:58,300  -->  00:07:01,930
so celebrate with your new found knowledge 
and I'll see you in the next lecture.
