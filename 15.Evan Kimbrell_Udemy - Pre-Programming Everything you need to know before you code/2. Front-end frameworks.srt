00:00:00,000  -->  00:00:02,340
Hey guys, welcome back to the course.
2

2

00:00:02,340  -->  00:00:06,500
Ok, so in the last lecture we learned what frameworks roughly are.
3

3

00:00:06,500  -->  00:00:11,090
They're pre-made code that you can use for your programming project
4

4

00:00:11,090  -->  00:00:15,320
to save you time and make that whole process easier and more effective.
5

5

00:00:15,320  -->  00:00:18,980
But there's an important distinction to keep 
in mind when thinking about frameworks.
6

6

00:00:18,980  -->  00:00:23,000
There are essentially two different separate types of frameworks
7

7

00:00:23,000  -->  00:00:24,720
that are not really that similar.
8

8

00:00:24,720  -->  00:00:28,190
We have front-end frameworks and we have back-end frameworks.
9

9

00:00:28,190  -->  00:00:33,050
Ok, so there exists on your browser a set of three different languages
10

10

00:00:33,050  -->  00:00:38,600
we've already covered in this course: HTML, CSS, and can you guess the third one?
11

11

00:00:38,600  -->  00:00:39,550
JavaScript.
12

12

00:00:39,550  -->  00:00:44,680
Those three determine the look, the feel, and the interactivity of the website,
13

13

00:00:44,680  -->  00:00:47,790
and then behind the scenes we have a different set of languages
14

14

00:00:47,790  -->  00:00:53,550
that are doing all of the heavy lifting, and all of the applications' bidding.
15

15

00:00:53,550  -->  00:00:58,530
Now, those two sets of languages do 
different things and are inherently very different,
16

16

00:00:58,530  -->  00:01:02,500
and that's why we have two distinctive frameworks aimed at helping each side,
17

17

00:01:02,500  -->  00:01:05,030
the browser side and the server side.
18

18

00:01:05,030  -->  00:01:06,830
In this lecture and the next couple of lectures
19

19

00:01:06,830  -->  00:01:10,310
we're going to take a peek at the first kind - front-end frameworks.
20

20

00:01:10,310  -->  00:01:14,110
If you really think about it, you could probably 
deduce what a front-end framework does.
21

21

00:01:14,110  -->  00:01:18,980
Since we're concerning ourselves with looks, 
and positioning, and visual organization,
22

22

00:01:18,980  -->  00:01:22,450
what do you think a front-end framework is probably going to do?
23

23

00:01:22,450  -->  00:01:24,790
Remember, it's something that helps you speed up efficiency
24

24

00:01:24,790  -->  00:01:28,400
by giving you a lot of the basic stuff that you would have to
25

25

00:01:28,400  -->  00:01:31,230
create from scratch if you were starting from scratch.
26

26

00:01:31,230  -->  00:01:32,690
Well, if you haven't guessed it already,
27

27

00:01:32,690  -->  00:01:36,830
it's going to give the developer a pre-made system.
28

28

00:01:36,830  -->  00:01:39,730
It's essentially going to give them a template website
29

29

00:01:39,730  -->  00:01:42,670
that's set up in the most convenient way possible.
30

30

00:01:42,670  -->  00:01:49,880
In most cases, it will give them a CSS sheet 
that gives the developer a pre-made "grid system".
31

31

00:01:49,880  -->  00:01:54,910
In front-end development, a grid system just means making a style sheet
32

32

00:01:54,910  -->  00:01:58,350
that allows you to easily put images, buttons, and text,
33

33

00:01:58,350  -->  00:02:04,610
and anything else you want on the site 
into easy to use and see vertical columns.
34

34

00:02:04,610  -->  00:02:09,260
So if you had, let's say, a three-column grid, that means I could put
35

35

00:02:09,260  -->  00:02:12,900
one thing on the left third of the screen, in that column,
36

36

00:02:12,900  -->  00:02:14,500
one in the middle, in the middle column,
37

37

00:02:14,500  -->  00:02:16,870
and one on the right, in the right column.
38

38

00:02:16,870  -->  00:02:20,340
And since that grid came from a framework, the framework would automatically
39

39

00:02:20,340  -->  00:02:24,910
place all of the objects within those columns for me,
40

40

00:02:24,910  -->  00:02:28,610
and keep them in the right place as I use this on different screens.
41

41

00:02:28,610  -->  00:02:34,560
Now, this is obviously an oversimplification, 
but trust me, it saves developers a lot of time,
42

42

00:02:34,560  -->  00:02:39,480
because it takes a lot of time to just sit there and make a grid from scratch,
43

43

00:02:39,480  -->  00:02:42,220
saying it needs to be this height, and this width, and everything that
44

44

00:02:42,220  -->  00:02:46,030
has this name goes over here, it's just an unnecessary process.
45

45

00:02:46,030  -->  00:02:48,070
Another thing a front-end framework might do is
46

46

00:02:48,070  -->  00:02:52,370
give what's called a "UI pack" or a "UI kit."
47

47

00:02:52,370  -->  00:02:56,470
UI stands for User Interface, which is a really fancy way of saying
48

48

00:02:56,470  -->  00:03:00,220
"what you see on the screen," like buttons, and like text.
49

49

00:03:00,220  -->  00:03:05,200
In this case, a UI pack or a UI kit would give them a pre-made set of
50

50

00:03:05,200  -->  00:03:11,190
button designs, fonts, sliders, headers, really any common component
51

51

00:03:11,190  -->  00:03:13,790
you would see on almost all websites.
52

52

00:03:13,790  -->  00:03:18,330
It could even give you, say, graphic design for more specific things,
53

53

00:03:18,330  -->  00:03:25,110
like profile pictures, frames for images, charts, a lot of more specific detail things.
54

54

00:03:25,110  -->  00:03:29,420
Past that, we'll typically see a front-end framework maybe give a set of
55

55

00:03:29,420  -->  00:03:34,980
pre-used JavaScript commands for things that, again, are routine and very common.
56

56

00:03:34,980  -->  00:03:38,780
Things like submitting forms, things like popups, sliders,
57

57

00:03:38,780  -->  00:03:42,680
search boxes, error messages, that kind of thing.
58

58

00:03:42,680  -->  00:03:46,760
Of course, not all of them are the same but for the most part
59

59

00:03:46,760  -->  00:03:49,600
we'll see these three common things.
60

60

00:03:49,600  -->  00:03:55,470
We'll see grids, we'll see UI kits, and we'll see what are called interaction snippets,
61

61

00:03:55,470  -->  00:03:58,000
also known as just little chunks of JavaScript.
62

62

00:03:58,000  -->  00:04:00,610
Now, in simple plain English terms, I would call this:
63

63

00:04:00,610  -->  00:04:03,550
one, grids we would call probably layouts,
64

64

00:04:03,550  -->  00:04:07,810
number two, as opposed to saying UI kits I'd just say buttons and other objects,
65

65

00:04:07,810  -->  00:04:13,200
and three, I'd call interaction snippets just pieces of action code,
66

66

00:04:13,200  -->  00:04:17,520
little bits of JavaScript for pulling information and communicating with the server,
67

67

00:04:17,520  -->  00:04:19,320
and doing those basic tasks.
68

68

00:04:19,320  -->  00:04:21,860
Ok, in the next lecture, let's actually jump in and look at
69

69

00:04:21,860  -->  00:04:25,530
one of the most popular front-end frameworks out there: Bootstrap.
70

70

00:04:25,530  -->  00:04:26,270
All right, see you then!
