00:00:00.000  -->  00:00:01.770
Hey hey hey, we're back.
2

2

00:00:01.770  -->  00:00:06.680
Ok, so in this lecture, we're going to start 
with the most basic question of them all.
3

3

00:00:06.680  -->  00:00:08.150
What is a computer?
4

4

00:00:08.150  -->  00:00:13.700
Ok, stay with me here, I know it can 
sound really simplistic, but trust me,
5

5

00:00:13.700  -->  00:00:18.200
it really actually matters because most people 
have way too narrow of an idea
6

6

00:00:18.200  -->  00:00:22.750
of what computers actually are, and if you want 
to learn more advanced concepts,
7

7

00:00:22.750  -->  00:00:27.160
you have to start with the correct way 
of thinking about technology.
8

8

00:00:27.160  -->  00:00:30.360
Ok, so most people, when they hear the 
word "computer," they're going to think of
9

9

00:00:30.360  -->  00:00:36.100
a laptop, or an iPad, or some type of 
personal computer, like a desktop.
10

10

00:00:36.100  -->  00:00:39.870
Some people, like your parents, 
when asked if a MacBook is a computer,
11

11

00:00:39.870  -->  00:00:45.320
would respond "No, it's a laptop". 
And that's fine, but it's really not
12

12

00:00:45.320  -->  00:00:49.570
just the thing you run Windows 8 or Mac OS X on.
13

13

00:00:49.570  -->  00:00:54.260
A computer is actually, 
it's literally anything that computes.
14

14

00:00:54.260  -->  00:00:58.990
It's a thing that can determine an amount 
or a number given certain rules.
15

15

00:00:58.990  -->  00:01:03.500
That is the dictionary definition of a computer 
straight out of Webster's.
16

16

00:01:03.500  -->  00:01:09.400
So yes, your MacBook laptop is a computer, 
but technically so is your calculator.
17

17

00:01:09.400  -->  00:01:14.900
Watches, wearables, cash registers, 
even that RFID badge you use
18

18

00:01:14.900  -->  00:01:18.380
to get in and out of work, 
these are all technically computers.
19

19

00:01:18.380  -->  00:01:21.680
Unless you're driving something from the roaring twenties,
20

20

00:01:21.680  -->  00:01:25.900
your car engine probably has a computer 
that monitors its performance
21

21

00:01:25.900  -->  00:01:29.060
and makes whatever adjustments it thinks are necessary.
22

22

00:01:29.060  -->  00:01:32.850
If you want to get into the details of that one, 
it's actually called an engine control unit,
23

23

00:01:32.850  -->  00:01:37.100
or an engine control module, and yes, 
it's responsible for that
24

24

00:01:37.100  -->  00:01:40.740
"check engine" light you really wish would just go away.
25

25

00:01:40.740  -->  00:01:43.970
Your brain technically is kind of like a computer, too.
26

26

00:01:43.970  -->  00:01:48.800
Go ahead, add some numbers in your head, 
if it came out correct or slightly different,
27

27

00:01:48.800  -->  00:01:50.480
congratulations, you are a machine!
28

28

00:01:50.480  -->  00:01:52.450
Now that's the absolute simplest way you can understand
29

29

00:01:52.450  -->  00:01:55.900
what a computer is, but a more practical way 
of understanding it is that
30

30

00:01:55.900  -->  00:01:58.350
it's any machine designed to solve problems
31

31

00:01:58.350  -->  00:02:00.310
* And that's what I do, I solve problems *
32

32

00:02:00.310  -->  00:02:01.250
automatically.
33

33

00:02:01.250  -->  00:02:06.700
Computers will solve all of the problems 
within certain parameters that you give to them.
34

34

00:02:06.700  -->  00:02:10.690
They will solve a math problem, 
but they won't solve a problem like
35

35

00:02:10.690  -->  00:02:12.070
the SWAT team on your roof.
36

36

00:02:12.070  -->  00:02:15.830
To help stick this point kind of home, 
here's an actual true fact.
37

37

00:02:15.830  -->  00:02:21.200
Early on, before we even knew what a computer was, 
as we commonly know it,
38

38

00:02:21.200  -->  00:02:25.400
the word "computer" was actually created to describe people,
39

39

00:02:25.400  -->  00:02:29.450
so people who solved mathematical problems, 
technically it was used
40

40

00:02:29.450  -->  00:02:35.000
in the military for artillery, and their job was, 
as to artillery, to fire,
41

41

00:02:35.000  -->  00:02:39.770
constantly keep running numbers for 
the next round of artillery shells.
42

42

00:02:39.770  -->  00:02:43.800
Then humans figured out how to build 
machines to do all of that stuff for them
43

43

00:02:43.800  -->  00:02:49.200
in a way that was more truly automatic, 
and voila, we are now better at
44

44

00:02:49.200  -->  00:02:52.050
killing each other with large guns 
and also keeping records of
45

45

00:02:52.050  -->  00:02:54.040
how much cash we blow in the process.
46

46

00:02:54.040  -->  00:02:54.800
...America.
47

47

00:02:54.800  -->  00:02:58.770
Ok, so do you see how the word "computer" 
is actually pretty massive in scope,
48

48

00:02:58.770  -->  00:03:02.850
and there are basically computers all around you, 
everywhere you go?
49

49

00:03:02.850  -->  00:03:06.930
Waiting to download your soul, 
so they can live forever and feel love.
50

50

00:03:06.930  -->  00:03:10.950
So that's it. A computer is something 
that takes instructions and can run
51

51

00:03:10.950  -->  00:03:15.650
a calculation to give you a solution, 
and understanding it like that,
52

52

00:03:15.650  -->  00:03:19.100
here are instructions, here is a process, 
and here is an output,
53

53

00:03:19.100  -->  00:03:23.380
is the first step in understanding 
what it is that programmers do.
54

54

00:03:23.380  -->  00:03:27.100
So to recap, computers, they're all around you, 
they solve problems,
55

55

00:03:27.100  -->  00:03:30.550
and also, don't ignore that "check engine" light on your dash.
56

56

00:03:30.550  -->  00:03:31.780
All right, see you in the next lecture!
