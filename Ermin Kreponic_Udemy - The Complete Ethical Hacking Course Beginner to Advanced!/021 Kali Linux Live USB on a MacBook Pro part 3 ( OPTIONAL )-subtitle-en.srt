1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:00,854
So we're back.

2
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:05,125
The next portion,
the next step that I wanted to put

3
00:00:05,360 --> 00:00:08,629
in a segmented section, not only
due to the time limitations but also

4
00:00:08,664 --> 00:00:13,586
because this is the portion where if you do this,

5
00:00:14,021 --> 00:00:17,693
you run a risk of basically damaging your system,

6
00:00:18,028 --> 00:00:20,208
probably not in a physical sense,

7
00:00:20,343 --> 00:00:22,805
but rather instead in a software sense because

8
00:00:23,614 --> 00:00:25,175
you will most likely...

9
00:00:25,210 --> 00:00:28,768
if something goes wrong
there is really little than you can do.

10
00:00:28,903 --> 00:00:31,367
Most likely you will have to do a clean reinstall

11
00:00:31,402 --> 00:00:34,917
and I have stated this
in the very beginning several times.

12
00:00:34,952 --> 00:00:37,325
I have stated this is not the recommended set-up,

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,372
but here you go, here is how you can do it.

14
00:00:42,664 --> 00:00:44,535
So, first off, we're gonna

15
00:00:45,835 --> 00:00:50,322
go over to the net and
you can take a look at this site

16
00:00:50,664 --> 00:00:52,835
but I will also give you a link and

17
00:00:54,085 --> 00:00:56,018
or the file which you can download,

18
00:00:56,153 --> 00:00:59,134
but feel free to take a look
at this site as well if you wish.

19
00:01:01,426 --> 00:01:03,249
This is the tool that you're going to need,

20
00:01:03,284 --> 00:01:07,714
it says that rEFit is a
boot menu and maintenance toolkit

21
00:01:08,552 --> 00:01:10,902
for EFI based machines like Intel Macs.

22
00:01:12,337 --> 00:01:16,957
And also it says "as you may have noticed rEFit

23
00:01:16,992 --> 00:01:22,291
is no longer actively
maintained. Please check out rEFind,

24
00:01:22,326 --> 00:01:25,586
a fork that is maintained
and under active development".

25
00:01:26,346 --> 00:01:27,948
So you can also go with that one,

26
00:01:28,943 --> 00:01:31,130
I've had some problems with it and I figured,

27
00:01:31,465 --> 00:01:34,467
since I have an older Mac from 2011,

28
00:01:34,502 --> 00:01:39,043
I'm gonna go ahead and use
this one instead, the older one.

29
00:01:40,542 --> 00:01:42,572
You can also go and try with that one as well,

30
00:01:42,607 --> 00:01:45,124
I have tried and had limited success.

31
00:01:47,804 --> 00:01:51,090
I'm not going to download it,
but this is the one that we will be using.

32
00:01:51,625 --> 00:01:56,258
It's a Mac disk image, rEFit, and

33
00:01:57,615 --> 00:01:59,288
I'm gonna go into the...

34
00:02:01,215 --> 00:02:02,741
No, it should be around here somewhere.

35
00:02:02,976 --> 00:02:08,473
In the Downloads, you can see
that I have indeed downloaded this one

36
00:02:08,708 --> 00:02:12,821
but this is a dmg file, so just double click on it

37
00:02:13,370 --> 00:02:15,889
and it's gonna go ahead and open it.

38
00:02:20,739 --> 00:02:22,895
Don't do this to me, please.

39
00:02:24,451 --> 00:02:28,735
There you go, and this is what you need: mpkg.

40
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:30,490
Just double click on it

41
00:02:32,014 --> 00:02:35,037
and it's gonna take you
through the installation procedure.

42
00:02:35,072 --> 00:02:36,997
I already have it here,

43
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:42,213
but just click, click, click,
click through the end. That's it.

44
00:02:44,991 --> 00:02:47,253
This might actually mess your...

45
00:02:47,388 --> 00:02:50,929
mess your system up, so keep it in mind.

46
00:02:50,964 --> 00:02:53,490
There's nothing special here, just continue,

47
00:02:55,291 --> 00:02:58,305
license, continue, agree.

48
00:03:00,288 --> 00:03:02,295
You can just go ahead and click on

49
00:03:02,811 --> 00:03:05,504
Install here and then the
installation goes through and the rest.

50
00:03:05,839 --> 00:03:10,155
There is no special options or
something like that that you need to select.

51
00:03:10,972 --> 00:03:14,188
Here's basically click and go. No big deal.

52
00:03:14,223 --> 00:03:16,060
Unless you wish to customize something,

53
00:03:16,095 --> 00:03:18,956
which I definitely would
not recommend at this time.

54
00:03:19,291 --> 00:03:23,193
So this file will be provided,
of course, but you can also go ahead

55
00:03:23,428 --> 00:03:26,218
and check out the site and
download it from here if you wish.

56
00:03:28,047 --> 00:03:31,883
OK, so now I am gonna go ahead and

57
00:03:32,768 --> 00:03:38,473
basically minimize this and we're gonna go ahead

58
00:03:38,508 --> 00:03:41,527
and switch to my phone
now, from where I'm going to

59
00:03:41,562 --> 00:03:45,430
record the rest of the video
because I need to reboot the machine

60
00:03:45,465 --> 00:03:47,959
and show you how it is...

61
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:52,622
how it is done. Let's go ahead and call it here

62
00:03:52,657 --> 00:03:56,102
and I'll be back in a moment,
where we will do the stated.

63
00:03:59,692 --> 00:04:02,035
Okay, so welcome back, I guess.

64
00:04:02,270 --> 00:04:04,057
Now I've switched to my phone.

65
00:04:05,438 --> 00:04:10,749
So I have changed
this a little bit. It's now Kali 2.

66
00:04:12,049 --> 00:04:15,579
Completely irrelevant to you, I've just renamed it

67
00:04:15,714 --> 00:04:19,408
to something more peacing
to my eyes, but it's not going to affect you

68
00:04:19,543 --> 00:04:22,132
in any possible way.

69
00:04:22,167 --> 00:04:24,850
So you can do that too, you can redo the procedure

70
00:04:24,885 --> 00:04:29,461
and in the beginning you
can label it as Kali 2 if you want.

71
00:04:29,496 --> 00:04:32,181
I've shown you where
you can relabel the devices with

72
00:04:34,921 --> 00:04:38,351
the Disk Utilities in Mac.

73
00:04:39,368 --> 00:04:42,584
But it's completely irrelevant, I would suggest

74
00:04:42,619 --> 00:04:44,792
that you go ahead and
follow through. I'm a perfectionist,

75
00:04:44,927 --> 00:04:47,465
so it was kind of just stabbing me in my eyes.

76
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:51,177
Anyway, let's go. So over here you have,

77
00:04:51,993 --> 00:04:55,523
I have a power cord attached to MacBook,

78
00:04:56,698 --> 00:04:59,223
something I advise you to have during this,

79
00:04:59,258 --> 00:05:03,336
a USB that we've just
made, it's plugged in directly,

80
00:05:04,322 --> 00:05:07,835
not through a hub or
anything like that, this is a USB hub.

81
00:05:07,970 --> 00:05:12,507
I didn't use a USB hub,
I did try doing it via USB hub,

82
00:05:12,542 --> 00:05:14,290
seems to work fine but in some forums

83
00:05:14,703 --> 00:05:16,562
they suggested and advised against it.

84
00:05:17,392 --> 00:05:19,222
Now that you have all of this set up

85
00:05:20,481 --> 00:05:23,536
I advise you now to go
ahead and shut your machine down,

86
00:05:23,571 --> 00:05:26,425
not reboot, shut it down, like, completely.

87
00:05:29,053 --> 00:05:32,005
I'm pretty sure you can
see the letters, but even if you can't

88
00:05:32,040 --> 00:05:34,953
all you need to do is shut
the machine down, quite literally.

89
00:05:37,124 --> 00:05:41,041
Yes, I would like to reopen the
windows and, please, shut down.

90
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:44,257
Let the seeding stop.

91
00:05:45,309 --> 00:05:48,006
I'm just seeding Kali Linux on download.

92
00:05:53,507 --> 00:05:55,696
Anytime, anytime.

93
00:05:57,017 --> 00:06:00,562
And here you can actually see me in my t-shirt

94
00:06:00,597 --> 00:06:02,796
that I've been wearing for days now,

95
00:06:03,031 --> 00:06:05,831
and behind me, the rest of my place, I guess

96
00:06:07,220 --> 00:06:08,793
in the reflection of the screen.

97
00:06:08,928 --> 00:06:12,478
After this I'm gonna go ahead
and answer all your questions on Udemy

98
00:06:12,513 --> 00:06:15,042
and I'm gonna head to shower and bed.

99
00:06:16,606 --> 00:06:19,817
Down here, you have Power button,

100
00:06:19,852 --> 00:06:22,451
could be in a bit of a different place for you,

101
00:06:22,486 --> 00:06:25,427
but basically all you need
to do is power the machine back on.

102
00:06:25,462 --> 00:06:28,496
So Power button, very important, keep an eye on it

103
00:06:28,531 --> 00:06:31,449
know where it is, you're
gonna need to press it again later on.

104
00:06:31,888 --> 00:06:34,184
Let's go ahead and power the machine back on.

105
00:06:36,004 --> 00:06:38,392
You can hear the CD and the boot..

106
00:06:39,835 --> 00:06:43,039
You can see in the left corner,

107
00:06:43,074 --> 00:06:46,431
where my finger is now, that the USB is blinking

108
00:06:46,766 --> 00:06:52,201
and this is a non-standard Mac
boot, you can see that it says rEFit,

109
00:06:53,115 --> 00:06:55,995
so let's go ahead and select what we need.

110
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,930
Let me just zoom in so you can read the letters

111
00:07:00,065 --> 00:07:01,696
because they are a bit more important now.

112
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:07,296
So we've got Boot EFI. No, we need... Manager,

113
00:07:07,331 --> 00:07:09,215
no, this is not gonna work, I tried it.

114
00:07:09,250 --> 00:07:12,118
If it works for you, great. If not, just go ahead

115
00:07:12,153 --> 00:07:13,785
and select the one that I have selected,

116
00:07:13,969 --> 00:07:16,566
it says boot EFI\boot\grubx64.efi

117
00:07:16,601 --> 00:07:19,290
and that is the one that I shall boot now.

118
00:07:19,325 --> 00:07:20,763
So go for it.

119
00:07:23,418 --> 00:07:27,284
You get this GNU GRUB version 2.0

120
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:29,478
I'm gonna go ahead and say boot persistent,

121
00:07:29,513 --> 00:07:34,370
even though it's not going to
matter in a sense that it usually does

122
00:07:34,405 --> 00:07:37,505
but we will still have a persistent partition there.

123
00:07:38,939 --> 00:07:40,656
So let's go ahead and say boot persistent.

124
00:07:41,091 --> 00:07:42,849
More me.

125
00:07:44,058 --> 00:07:45,836
Take a good long look if you like.

126
00:07:47,394 --> 00:07:49,736
Down here it's just reading, reading, reading,

127
00:07:49,771 --> 00:07:52,984
loading, loading, loading. Fine. Whatever.

128
00:07:53,865 --> 00:07:58,622
Just go for it, I mean,
you can feel free to read if you like

129
00:07:58,757 --> 00:08:00,294
but doesn't really matter.

130
00:08:00,329 --> 00:08:03,545
That's something that the
system is doing and that is informing us

131
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:05,312
of what it is actually doing.

132
00:08:07,858 --> 00:08:09,949
Going through, going through.

133
00:08:11,450 --> 00:08:12,927
Come on...

134
00:08:15,898 --> 00:08:17,471
Oh man, there's a lot.

135
00:08:18,939 --> 00:08:22,102
Okay, so there will be a
catch during the boot-up procedure

136
00:08:24,605 --> 00:08:27,017
where we will need to play
around with the Power button a little bit.

137
00:08:27,052 --> 00:08:29,237
Don't worry, you won't need to open up anything

138
00:08:29,272 --> 00:08:31,129
or do anything like that.

139
00:08:31,164 --> 00:08:33,796
So you see it just boots and,

140
00:08:33,831 --> 00:08:35,605
well, doesn't actually boot.

141
00:08:35,840 --> 00:08:38,230
There is a blank, there is a black screen

142
00:08:38,265 --> 00:08:40,157
and then there is a flashing USB.

143
00:08:40,192 --> 00:08:43,394
I'm sincerely hoping that you
have a USB that flashes, if you don't

144
00:08:43,429 --> 00:08:46,524
after the black screen appears, give it ten minutes

145
00:08:46,559 --> 00:08:48,474
and do the following. If you have a flashing one

146
00:08:49,226 --> 00:08:50,321
well, just wait for it,

147
00:08:50,955 --> 00:08:52,276
like I do.

148
00:08:53,165 --> 00:08:56,828
The flashing seems to have stopped
and you can see that the machine...

149
00:08:56,863 --> 00:09:01,628
See this light here? It's not in
stand-by mode or anything like that.

150
00:09:01,663 --> 00:09:04,374
If you come close to the machine,
you can still hear the fan spinning,

151
00:09:04,809 --> 00:09:08,194
and I'm gonna go ahead...
Maybe you can hear it here as well.

152
00:09:08,229 --> 00:09:10,802
Look, the Power button. So, it's right here.

153
00:09:11,337 --> 00:09:16,712
Do a short press on the Power
button, a very short press will do.

154
00:09:16,747 --> 00:09:19,218
Don't hold it for long, if you hold it for long

155
00:09:19,253 --> 00:09:21,393
you're going to mess it up because

156
00:09:21,428 --> 00:09:23,994
you're going to power
the machine down, completely.

157
00:09:24,029 --> 00:09:26,893
So keep an eye on this.

158
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:34,848
On the light and let's go ahead
and power the machine back on,

159
00:09:34,883 --> 00:09:36,743
well, no, just wake it up, I guess.

160
00:09:36,778 --> 00:09:38,350
Just press it once.

161
00:09:38,785 --> 00:09:42,339
And you can see that the LED has turned on

162
00:09:42,374 --> 00:09:45,085
and now it's slowly flashing, painfully slow.

163
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:48,920
Then press it again. So I did a one short press

164
00:09:48,955 --> 00:09:50,975
and now I'm gonna do a second short press.

165
00:09:54,530 --> 00:09:56,926
Second short press was done, and there we go.

166
00:09:57,061 --> 00:09:59,405
It's going through the procedure again.

167
00:10:03,999 --> 00:10:05,502
There you go, voilà!

168
00:10:05,637 --> 00:10:08,206
Kali is here and running.

169
00:10:08,241 --> 00:10:10,719
So we can go ahead and log in.

170
00:10:12,441 --> 00:10:17,530
Password will be t-o-o-r, the default password

171
00:10:17,865 --> 00:10:20,192
and the default username
will be "root" and there you go,

172
00:10:20,227 --> 00:10:21,873
Kali is running.

173
00:10:23,410 --> 00:10:28,348
It's semi-persistent,
you have the persistence partition

174
00:10:28,383 --> 00:10:30,397
in the upper right corner here.

175
00:10:30,432 --> 00:10:36,705
Let's open it up. So this is a
persistent partition and everything else

176
00:10:36,740 --> 00:10:40,988
that is on the other partition
which we have created is not persistent.

177
00:10:41,023 --> 00:10:45,154
So on this partition you can
make one small script and then...

178
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:50,228
bash script and then just issue a
set of commands which you want to run.

179
00:10:50,263 --> 00:10:51,679
So when the machine boots

180
00:10:51,714 --> 00:10:54,300
open up your persistent
partition and run the script.

181
00:10:56,494 --> 00:11:00,731
All that is saved here, where my
mouse is moving and my hand is moving,

182
00:11:00,966 --> 00:11:05,057
on this partition, casper-rw, is permanent.

183
00:11:05,092 --> 00:11:08,349
You can also name it any
other way because "casper" is for...

184
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:12,273
the way I explained it
on a PC, so I just kept the name.

185
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:17,117
Anything that you save here will be persistent,

186
00:11:17,152 --> 00:11:22,199
anything else, on any other
partition, will not survive a reboot.

187
00:11:22,234 --> 00:11:25,387
So any actions that you take or something of a kind,

188
00:11:25,422 --> 00:11:28,130
you can save them here
and then just continue from there.

189
00:11:28,165 --> 00:11:31,904
If you want your configuration
saved, more importantly, on your Kali,

190
00:11:31,939 --> 00:11:35,097
you can make a bash script with a set of commands

191
00:11:35,132 --> 00:11:37,240
that you would type
in the terminal, exactly the same,

192
00:11:38,392 --> 00:11:41,008
and just run the bash script and
those commands will execute one by one

193
00:11:41,043 --> 00:11:44,723
and will configure your Kali every time you boot.

194
00:11:44,758 --> 00:11:47,271
You run the script once and
it configures it to your preference,

195
00:11:47,406 --> 00:11:49,465
you just create the script here and that's it.

196
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,210
If you need help with the bash
script, feel free to reach out to me

197
00:11:53,345 --> 00:11:55,967
in the discussions section.
You know I'm always there to help.

198
00:11:56,002 --> 00:11:58,693
I answer as many questions as I can on

199
00:11:58,728 --> 00:12:00,090
pretty much daily basis.

200
00:12:00,125 --> 00:12:04,252
But for these couple of days
I've been really stuck with this,

201
00:12:04,287 --> 00:12:07,396
nearly an impossible job to create a boot on

202
00:12:09,149 --> 00:12:11,767
MacBooks that are older than 2012.

203
00:12:13,362 --> 00:12:17,390
2013, 14, something like that,
that's gonna work without any problems.

204
00:12:17,425 --> 00:12:20,883
Just plug and play,
use that program that I've showed you,

205
00:12:20,918 --> 00:12:23,782
create a USB and it's going to...

206
00:12:23,817 --> 00:12:27,185
I mean, I've tested it out on a MacBook 2013.

207
00:12:28,609 --> 00:12:33,489
It works with a Retina display, works
without any problems of whatsoever.

208
00:12:33,524 --> 00:12:36,113
I do believe that's Retina, don't hold my word to it.

209
00:12:36,148 --> 00:12:38,367
But doesn't really matter, just the year matters.

210
00:12:38,402 --> 00:12:41,461
So it works without any problems, but on older ones

211
00:12:41,496 --> 00:12:44,580
it's trully a painful experience.

212
00:12:44,615 --> 00:12:48,478
All the files that you will
need for this will be on Udemy,

213
00:12:48,513 --> 00:12:51,399
either in a form of a link

214
00:12:52,134 --> 00:12:56,391
or they will actually be there
from where you can download them.

215
00:12:56,426 --> 00:12:59,550
Anyway, this concludes this chapter with Macs.

216
00:12:59,585 --> 00:13:03,836
If you have any questions
with Macs, in regard to Macs,

217
00:13:03,871 --> 00:13:06,494
feel free to reach out to
me in the discussions once again.

218
00:13:08,430 --> 00:13:11,272
Again, at the end of this tutorial

219
00:13:12,694 --> 00:13:14,689
of this chapter, I'm going to say

220
00:13:14,724 --> 00:13:18,022
that I do not recommend this on a Mac at all.

221
00:13:18,057 --> 00:13:21,061
First of all, running the risk of

222
00:13:21,196 --> 00:13:24,195
being forced to reboot your system and

223
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:28,193
basically, a high chance
that you'll encounter problems,

224
00:13:28,228 --> 00:13:30,100
difficulties and so on and so forth.

225
00:13:31,303 --> 00:13:33,095
That's it. I bid you all farewell

226
00:13:33,130 --> 00:13:38,395
and I hope that I have helped
at least some of you achive your goals.
