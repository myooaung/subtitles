00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:03.720

Welcome back everybody to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:07.240

Today I am going to actually show you

how to



3

00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:09.300

Well everything is pretty much set up.



4

00:00:09.300 --> 00:00:11.469

You just need to do a few more things in VirtualBox



5

00:00:11.469 --> 00:00:15.330

in order to have a proper setup



6

00:00:15.330 --> 00:00:17.800

but down below in the bottom right

corner



7

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:20.300

if you are using a desktop machine and not a laptop



8

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:25.660

and if you didn't have wireless previously on your desktop machine



9

00:00:25.660 --> 00:00:28.900

upon installing these drivers and plugging in this USB adapter



10

00:00:28.900 --> 00:00:30.700

you will, from this point on



11

00:00:30.700 --> 00:00:34.900

actually have wireless access on your physical machine as well.



12

00:00:34.900 --> 00:00:36.300

Not on your physical machine, sorry



13

00:00:36.300 --> 00:00:37.510

on your desktop machine



14

00:00:37.510 --> 00:00:40.800

because a lot of the desktop machines come without any wireless



15

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:42.190

as they are workstations



16

00:00:42.190 --> 00:00:46.059

so this might be also a helpful bit of information to know.



17

00:00:46.060 --> 00:00:51.600

Anyway, let's just go ahead and right click on our Kali machine



18

00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.949

Go into "Settings"



19

00:00:52.949 --> 00:00:55.000

Click on "USB"



20

00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.200

This will be disabled and you won't have anything selected here.



21

00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:03.100

So just go ahead and click on "Enable 20 EHCI controller"



22

00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:07.920

If things are not configured properly with the extension pack



23

00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:11.100

you will get a...hmmm, how is it



24

00:01:11.100 --> 00:01:14.920

A triangle. A yellow triangle with an exclamation mark in the center



25

00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:17.600

next to your "OK" button down at the middle.



26

00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:21.160

So right on the left of the "OK" button, you will get that triangle



27

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:25.000

which means that you don't have the

extension pack installed



28

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.100

You can, aside from going to the VirtualBox site



29

00:01:29.100 --> 00:01:32.960

where they have these three versions here: 4.2,  4.1, 4.0



30

00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:37.200

You can also go to the official Oracle site



31

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:40.120

and download the VirtualBox extension pack from there



32

00:01:40.120 --> 00:01:44.009

where they actually have 4.3.26, which is very nice



33

00:01:44.009 --> 00:01:46.800

which is the latest one



34

00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.070

Just go ahead and head over to the official Oracle site



35

00:01:51.070 --> 00:01:53.800

and find the VirtualBox section there.



36

00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:56.060

From there, you can actually download the extension pack



37

00:01:56.060 --> 00:01:58.800

Anyway, just minimize this.



38

00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:01.100

We have enabled the USB to support



39

00:02:01.100 --> 00:02:03.250

and now let's go ahead and add our device.



40

00:02:03.250 --> 00:02:06.000

So here you have a listing of devices:



41

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:10.200

Headset, keyboard, some unknown device, something generic



42

00:02:10.200 --> 00:02:13.200

and down below you have 11m USB.



43

00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:15.700

That is the one that I'm going to add here.



44

00:02:15.700 --> 00:02:17.250

Click on "OK"



45

00:02:17.250 --> 00:02:18.630

There we go.



46

00:02:18.630 --> 00:02:21.800

All you have to do from this point on is

power your machine on



47

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:25.300

and that's it.



48

00:02:25.300 --> 00:02:28.600

So it might take a while for it to boot.



49

00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.500

This is my friend's computer.



50

00:02:30.500 --> 00:02:38.000

I haven't really installed Kali here, but instead I am using a live version.



51

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:40.480

As I have stated previously, I'm doing this on Windows 7



52

00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.000

but you can do it in Windows 8, Vista, whatever



53

00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.800

it's gonna work, no problems.



54

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.700

I believe it's gonna work on XP as well



55

00:02:46.700 --> 00:02:50.580

but no guarantees for XP and Vista



56

00:02:50.580 --> 00:02:53.700

as those systems are quite old, and I

don't know



57

00:02:53.700 --> 00:02:57.970

you might have some problems with VirtualBox or something a kind.



58

00:02:57.970 --> 00:03:01.200

That's a topic for another day.



59

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:07.230

Anyway, the boot process here is in route



60

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:13.200

and, I don't know, live versions usually take a bit longer.



61

00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.440

I would have put it up prior to this, so you wouldn't have to wait for the process.



62

00:03:18.450 --> 00:03:21.800

However, then I couldn't actually show

you



63

00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:24.300

how I configured VirtualBox to function with this



64

00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.400

because if you go ahead and right click on Kali now



65

00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:27.349

and go into "Settings"



66

00:03:27.349 --> 00:03:29.200

and go down to the USB



67

00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.400

you can see that the  "Enable USB controller"



68

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:34.300

and the "Enable USB 20" are greyed out



69

00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.300

and you can't actually take anything there, which can be problematic.



70

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.380

Although you can add new USB devices if you want



71

00:03:42.390 --> 00:03:45.600

even after the machine is actually turned on.



72

00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.000

So the boot process is en route



73

00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.370

Any moment now. Come on.



74

00:03:51.370 --> 00:03:55.100

Please! Begging you.



75

00:03:55.100 --> 00:03:57.000

Today. Some time.



76

00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000

Perhaps. Maybe not.



77

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.239

Ah...the beauty. The beauty of Windows machines.



78

00:04:04.239 --> 00:04:07.889

Anyway, Kali has booted.



79

00:04:07.889 --> 00:04:09.000

Almost



80

00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.200

There we go.



81

00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:12.800

So Kali is up and running now.



82

00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.500

If I just go ahead and click on the terminal  as we did before.



83

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.389

Just gonna go ahead and magnify it.



84

00:04:18.389 --> 00:04:22.079

Don't have the extensions here



85

00:04:22.079 --> 00:04:25.000

So don't have the full screen, but if I just do this



86

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.300

I believe this is sufficient for this additional tutorial.



87

00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:30.190

You can actually see clearly what is going on.



88

00:04:30.190 --> 00:04:34.900

If I type in "ifconfig", I believe that you can all read this text, no problems.



89

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.400

If you can't, let me know.



90

00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:40.700

You see that I have wlan0 adapter here.



91

00:04:40.700 --> 00:04:43.000

That is my wireless adapter.



92

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.200

If I scroll upwards, I can see that I also have eth0



93

00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:49.500

which is my wire network adapter



94

00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:54.340

which is currently in the bridged mode with my Kali machine.



95

00:04:54.340 --> 00:04:56.600

If I go to "Devices"



96

00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:57.300

"Network"



97

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.000

"Network settings"



98

00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:59.090

This is very important



99

00:04:59.100 --> 00:05:01.600

I need to say attached bridged adapter



100

00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:03.800

as I have stated several times before



101

00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:05.850

but felt like I should just say it one more time.



102

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:11.000

No big deal there.



103

00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.300

So, Bridged Adapter



104

00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:15.500

Select your adapter



105

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:16.700

Allow all



106

00:05:16.700 --> 00:05:18.100

Okay



107

00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:21.000

Excellent!



108

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.900

Oh yeah, one more thing --



109

00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:28.100

I've noticed a lot of people have been asking me about



110

00:05:28.100 --> 00:05:31.000

the mac addresses of their virtual machines.



111

00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.500

So if you are using a live CD or something like that



112

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:36.000

you could generate your own mac address with a mac changer



113

00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.229

as I have showed you before



114

00:05:37.229 --> 00:05:40.600

but if you're using a virtual machine,

you can just



115

00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.800

while the machine is powered off



116

00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:44.500

you can generate a new mac address.



117

00:05:44.500 --> 00:05:46.800

It says here you can change it here without any problems.



118

00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:49.290

It functions a bit differently because this is a virtual machine



119

00:05:49.290 --> 00:05:52.320

but you can just change the mac address here randomly



120

00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.669

to your heart's content.



121

00:05:55.669 --> 00:05:59.200

Anyway, as I said, you can see to the wlan0



122

00:05:59.200 --> 00:06:01.600

So let's just perform a bit of a test here.



123

00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:02.500

A test run



124

00:06:02.500 --> 00:06:07.000

Let's type in "iwlist"



125

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:17.139

and then I'm gonna type "wlan0 | grep ESSID"



126

00:06:17.139 --> 00:06:18.200

and if I press up



127

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:20.000

Unknown command



128

00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:22.200

Oh yeah, of course



129

00:06:22.200 --> 00:06:24.500

Scan



130

00:06:24.500 --> 00:06:25.210

and there you go!



131

00:06:25.210 --> 00:06:28.780

I can actually scan for all the wireless

networks in my area



132

00:06:28.780 --> 00:06:31.100

and I can connect this machine to them.



133

00:06:31.100 --> 00:06:32.410

This virtual machine, that is.



134

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:34.100

To them, without any problems.



135

00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:36.900

I believe that this should solve any problems



136

00:06:36.900 --> 00:06:41.000

that any Windows user has had with wireless configuration



137

00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:42.300

with their virtual machine



138

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.500

in regard to their virtual machines



139

00:06:44.500 --> 00:06:46.100

and if you have any questions



140

00:06:46.100 --> 00:06:48.700

if you have any problems, or anything of a kind



141

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:52.550

feel free to talk to me in the discussion section.



142

00:06:52.550 --> 00:06:55.810

I will, as always, be more than happy and willing to help you out



143

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:59.000

in anyway I can.



144

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000

Until then, I would like



145

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.200

I would like to say "Until next tutorial"



146

00:07:04.200 --> 00:07:05.600

but I don't know, you never know



147

00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:07.800

I could add some new ones in the future



148

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:11.200

but for the time being, I just made this

addition to help you out.
