1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,644
Today we're just gonna go ahead and see

2
00:00:02,679 --> 00:00:08,423
how can we actually
pass through a USB to our Kali virtual machine.

3
00:00:08,458 --> 00:00:11,682
Why do we need to do that?
The primary purpose of this

4
00:00:11,717 --> 00:00:14,414
would be to be able to pass a USB wireless adapter

5
00:00:14,449 --> 00:00:18,002
because, as I said before,
your virtual machine does not have access

6
00:00:18,037 --> 00:00:20,403
to your integrated network wireless card.

7
00:00:20,938 --> 00:00:26,978
If I type in the password
here and if I go ahead and zoom,

8
00:00:29,783 --> 00:00:32,258
so type in "ifconfig" and you can see

9
00:00:32,293 --> 00:00:34,766
that I have two interfaces listed here.

10
00:00:36,954 --> 00:00:39,560
This interface, this is not a
wireless interface and even though

11
00:00:40,146 --> 00:00:43,178
I am connected to the network via wireless,

12
00:00:43,213 --> 00:00:46,311
I am not connected to the network with a cable,

13
00:00:46,346 --> 00:00:48,967
I'm obviously using the wireless network

14
00:00:49,102 --> 00:00:52,089
as you can see in the upper right corner.

15
00:00:55,475 --> 00:00:58,201
That is a problem, because you won't be able

16
00:00:58,236 --> 00:01:00,173
to go through the wireless part of the course

17
00:01:00,208 --> 00:01:01,832
and you'll be able to see it and all that,

18
00:01:01,867 --> 00:01:04,315
but if you don't have access to the wireless card,

19
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:06,737
that can be problematic. Now, I've stated before

20
00:01:06,772 --> 00:01:08,805
that there are two ways of going about this.

21
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,805
One of the ways is checking
for the compatibility of your wireless card

22
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:15,577
with not only Kali Linux but Aircrack

23
00:01:15,712 --> 00:01:20,095
and see if it's compatible on aircrack-ng website.

24
00:01:22,130 --> 00:01:26,777
However, that procedure
has been somewhat frowned upon

25
00:01:27,112 --> 00:01:30,522
as you can't actually
just use the model of your card,

26
00:01:30,557 --> 00:01:33,240
you actually need to go
on the net and look for the chipset

27
00:01:33,275 --> 00:01:38,173
which is used by your
card and then use that chipset

28
00:01:38,208 --> 00:01:42,377
to go onto the Aircrack site
and look for that chipset number.

29
00:01:44,794 --> 00:01:47,334
Let's call it a number,
demarcation, whatever you wish to call it.

30
00:01:47,369 --> 00:01:49,351
Look for it and see if it's compatible.

31
00:01:50,363 --> 00:01:51,937
If you wanna go through the process,

32
00:01:52,072 --> 00:01:54,912
I mean, by all means, feel free to do so.

33
00:01:56,724 --> 00:01:59,434
I will even help you out, if you like

34
00:01:59,634 --> 00:02:02,185
but I have opted for a different solution,

35
00:02:02,220 --> 00:02:04,939
I have opted to actually
get a USB wireless adapter,

36
00:02:04,974 --> 00:02:07,197
pass it to a virtual machine and get

37
00:02:07,232 --> 00:02:09,388
an extra interface here for wireless.

38
00:02:09,723 --> 00:02:14,492
So the very first thing that
we need to do is power off our machines.

39
00:02:14,827 --> 00:02:20,625
Just type in "poweroff". Let's shut it down.

40
00:02:20,860 --> 00:02:24,570
The second thing that we will need to do is see

41
00:02:24,605 --> 00:02:27,963
if we're actually capable of passing through a USB.

42
00:02:28,098 --> 00:02:30,558
If not, we will need to install additional software.

43
00:02:30,793 --> 00:02:33,420
And I will show you which USB do I have,

44
00:02:33,455 --> 00:02:35,053
which USB wireless adapter do I have.

45
00:02:35,488 --> 00:02:39,649
So if we go over to Ports,

46
00:02:41,785 --> 00:02:47,133
and if we go over to USB, I have USB 1.1, USB 2.0

47
00:02:47,968 --> 00:02:52,271
so let me just plug my device in

48
00:02:52,453 --> 00:02:54,862
and let's see if it actually works out

49
00:02:55,097 --> 00:02:58,482
and this thing only has
two USB ports, which is amazing.

50
00:03:03,470 --> 00:03:08,051
If I say USB 2.0, invalid settings detected. Why?

51
00:03:17,011 --> 00:03:21,322
OK, so we need an extension
pack in order to be able to do this.

52
00:03:21,357 --> 00:03:24,236
I'm just gonna unplug
my device, I will show you later on

53
00:03:24,371 --> 00:03:27,017
which device am I using as a USB adapter,

54
00:03:27,552 --> 00:03:32,397
but we're just gonna say OK here and now

55
00:03:32,432 --> 00:03:36,092
we will open up our browser.

56
00:03:36,427 --> 00:03:38,551
I'm using the default one, Safari

57
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:40,438
even though I generally use Firefox

58
00:03:42,518 --> 00:03:44,592
but I'm assuming that this is stock,

59
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:48,411
so we're just gonna use
whatever we can from the system itself.

60
00:03:50,440 --> 00:03:52,604
Let's go ahead and search for

61
00:03:55,278 --> 00:03:57,862
"oracle virtualbox".

62
00:04:01,581 --> 00:04:05,914
And here we go. Oracle VM VirtualBox. Click on it.

63
00:04:09,511 --> 00:04:12,141
Sure, we can get it from here,

64
00:04:12,176 --> 00:04:14,710
but I was hoping to go straight to Oracle.

65
00:04:19,246 --> 00:04:21,152
Actually, wait. Let's see if we can get from here

66
00:04:21,187 --> 00:04:23,140
so I don't have to bother on their site.

67
00:04:27,060 --> 00:04:31,331
Downloads. Extension Pack. There we go.

68
00:04:31,366 --> 00:04:33,702
So I do have it here.
Actually I didn't notice it here.

69
00:04:33,937 --> 00:04:36,606
Usually I just went over to the Oracle site

70
00:04:36,841 --> 00:04:39,499
and then navigated my way through there to find

71
00:04:39,734 --> 00:04:41,440
the page that was dedicated for VirtualBox.

72
00:04:43,571 --> 00:04:46,996
"If you're using 4.3.30,
please download the extension pack here".

73
00:04:47,031 --> 00:04:51,730
But we're using 5.0.4.
By the way, before we actually download it

74
00:04:51,865 --> 00:04:55,041
we can check the version
of your VirtualBox in the Help menu.

75
00:04:58,214 --> 00:05:01,371
So just press on Content, it should be there.

76
00:05:06,232 --> 00:05:08,328
No. It is, actually it is.

77
00:05:08,363 --> 00:05:11,517
It's version 5.0.4. There you go.

78
00:05:13,016 --> 00:05:15,050
There are some slight interface variations

79
00:05:15,085 --> 00:05:18,760
between VirtualBox for Windows, Mac and Linux.

80
00:05:20,408 --> 00:05:23,303
But nothing too drastic, really, so no worries.

81
00:05:24,598 --> 00:05:27,062
Let's go back to Safari and it says

82
00:05:27,097 --> 00:05:31,092
VirtualBox 5.0.4 Oracle
VM VirtualBox Extension Pack,

83
00:05:31,127 --> 00:05:32,844
all supported platforms.

84
00:05:33,179 --> 00:05:36,849
So let's just go ahead and click on this link.

85
00:05:36,984 --> 00:05:40,386
The download is in progress,
this should take a lot less time

86
00:05:40,421 --> 00:05:43,571
as these things are not very big, it's just 16MB.

87
00:05:43,606 --> 00:05:45,503
Let's open it up.

88
00:05:47,488 --> 00:05:49,049
Are you gonna run?

89
00:05:51,761 --> 00:05:54,240
Please? Yes, no, maybe? No? Okay.

90
00:05:55,618 --> 00:06:01,366
So Downloads. Extension Pack. Here we go.

91
00:06:05,488 --> 00:06:07,571
"You are about to install VirtualBox extension pack.

92
00:06:07,606 --> 00:06:10,819
Extension packs complement
the functionality of VirtualBox..."

93
00:06:11,054 --> 00:06:13,273
I'm just reading this because
it's probably too tiny for you to see.

94
00:06:13,308 --> 00:06:15,859
Maybe it's not. I can see it
quite clearly from some distance away.

95
00:06:16,929 --> 00:06:20,005
"...the functionality of VirtualBox
and can contain system level software

96
00:06:20,420 --> 00:06:22,184
that could be potentially harmful to your system.

97
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:23,967
Please review the description below

98
00:06:23,992 --> 00:06:25,571
and only proceed if you have obtained

99
00:06:25,806 --> 00:06:28,548
the extension pack from a trusted source".

100
00:06:31,758 --> 00:06:35,325
I sincerely hope that we
have obtained it from a trusted source.

101
00:06:37,542 --> 00:06:40,393
This is science.
Safari is using an encrypted connection...

102
00:06:43,264 --> 00:06:44,786
Show me the certificate.

103
00:06:46,656 --> 00:06:51,520
VeriSign Class 3, OK,
so this should be fine, as far as I can see,

104
00:06:55,534 --> 00:06:59,613
https seems to check out,
as far as I can see anyway.

105
00:06:59,648 --> 00:07:02,565
There are never any 100% guarantees.

106
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:08,439
There's always that 0.0.0.00000something chance

107
00:07:08,474 --> 00:07:09,951
that something will go wrong.

108
00:07:11,162 --> 00:07:14,755
One more thing, if you are running anything else,

109
00:07:14,790 --> 00:07:17,137
any other programs that are like VirtualBox,

110
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:25,296
so if you have VMWare
or if you have parallels or something like that

111
00:07:26,031 --> 00:07:30,324
you might not want to
install VirtualBox alongside with them

112
00:07:30,359 --> 00:07:32,478
because it's generally not a good idea to run

113
00:07:32,513 --> 00:07:37,617
two instances of this
virtualization, softwares of this...

114
00:07:38,949 --> 00:07:43,847
It's just not a good idea,
not only on Mac but on any other system

115
00:07:43,882 --> 00:07:45,988
on Linux and Windows as well.

116
00:07:46,023 --> 00:07:49,604
So if you have one, either remove it or use it,

117
00:07:50,711 --> 00:07:52,921
do not install another one next to it.

118
00:07:52,956 --> 00:07:55,790
I mean, you can and you have
a chance that everything will work out,

119
00:07:56,025 --> 00:07:59,381
but, you know, just to keep it on the safe side.

120
00:07:59,416 --> 00:08:02,335
Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and click on Install.

121
00:08:02,670 --> 00:08:07,793
There is a license agreement
here to accept from Oracle. Agree.

122
00:08:09,432 --> 00:08:13,225
Now it's gonna prompt this
for a password, so let's just type that in.

123
00:08:16,242 --> 00:08:18,180
And now it is installing the extension pack.

124
00:08:19,575 --> 00:08:22,960
And there we go. It has
successfully managed to install it

125
00:08:22,995 --> 00:08:26,163
without any difficulties. Now what we need to do

126
00:08:26,198 --> 00:08:30,334
is simply go ahead and enter Settings,

127
00:08:32,432 --> 00:08:34,199
go into Ports.

128
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:39,488
These are serial ports,
nevermind that. Go into the USB

129
00:08:41,031 --> 00:08:45,839
and now you can select
2.0, 3.0, 1.1, whatever you wish.

130
00:08:46,074 --> 00:08:49,784
We're gonna go ahead and
select 2.0 and let's just see if this works.

131
00:08:50,830 --> 00:08:53,685
I can indeed see some of the things here.

132
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:57,593
Definitely Logitech USB Headset,
the one that I'm using to record this.

133
00:08:58,954 --> 00:09:00,499
I have access to that.

134
00:09:01,743 --> 00:09:05,233
I'm gonna go ahead and
say Ok for now and not add anything.

135
00:09:05,268 --> 00:09:09,115
I'm just gonna go over
to the net to show you a picture

136
00:09:09,450 --> 00:09:15,368
and a model number of the wireless
network adapter that I have next to me.

137
00:09:17,012 --> 00:09:20,785
It is not mandatory that
you get this particular adapter,

138
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:24,440
you can get any other that is compatible

139
00:09:25,075 --> 00:09:30,049
or that is accessible to you,
but make sure that it is compatible

140
00:09:30,084 --> 00:09:35,049
with Kali Linux, that it is
compatible with aircrack-ng.

141
00:09:38,325 --> 00:09:40,519
I'm gonna go ahead and see the model number,

142
00:09:40,554 --> 00:09:42,283
it's a bit of a lengthy one.

143
00:10:05,691 --> 00:10:07,543
OK, it's opening it up.

144
00:10:09,685 --> 00:10:11,900
I'm sincerely hoping that
you can all see the model number here,

145
00:10:11,935 --> 00:10:18,311
it's "awus036nhr v.2".

146
00:10:23,572 --> 00:10:27,482
I need images. So there we go.
This is how it actually looks like.

147
00:10:28,540 --> 00:10:30,625
This is what I'm holding in my hand now,

148
00:10:31,705 --> 00:10:34,502
any of these pictures will do, they're all showing

149
00:10:35,398 --> 00:10:40,018
I suppose, the same adapter,
and this is the one that I am using.

150
00:10:41,932 --> 00:10:44,357
This is the one that I've
tested out, if you want to use anything else,

151
00:10:44,592 --> 00:10:47,285
by all means, you are free to do so.

152
00:10:47,520 --> 00:10:50,710
This particular adapter is not a must-have,

153
00:10:50,745 --> 00:10:53,530
you can obviously take another one

154
00:10:53,565 --> 00:10:56,589
that you have checked for compatibility.

155
00:10:57,024 --> 00:11:02,789
Check for compatibility on this site: aircrack-ng.

156
00:11:06,939 --> 00:11:10,164
And let's go ahead, select Compatibility

157
00:11:12,955 --> 00:11:15,103
and there you go, you have the available chipsets

158
00:11:17,585 --> 00:11:21,559
It says "supported by airodump
for Linux", "supported by aireplay",

159
00:11:23,004 --> 00:11:25,589
"supported by airodump
for Windows", we don't really care about that.

160
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:33,219
But both, this needs to be
included "supported by airodump for Linux"

161
00:11:33,254 --> 00:11:36,044
and "supported by aireplay for Linux".

162
00:11:36,179 --> 00:11:38,755
You need to figure out
what is the chipset of your card.

163
00:11:38,790 --> 00:11:40,910
How do you figure out the chipset of your card?

164
00:11:42,274 --> 00:11:44,979
Write the model number and then

165
00:11:45,014 --> 00:11:47,907
just write the question
in your favorite search engine,

166
00:11:47,942 --> 00:11:52,005
"What is the chipset of
(the model number)", press Enter

167
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:56,005
and you'll be able to figure
it out, not a hard thing to do at all.

168
00:11:57,982 --> 00:12:01,743
Then take the chipset number and go here.

169
00:12:03,388 --> 00:12:05,329
Sorry, not the chipset
number, the chipset designation.

170
00:12:06,408 --> 00:12:10,726
And then come here and
try to figure out, try to find it.

171
00:12:10,961 --> 00:12:13,334
Even if it's not listed here,
it has a chance of working out.

172
00:12:13,569 --> 00:12:16,837
But, you know, it can be a little bit dodgy.

173
00:12:17,072 --> 00:12:19,317
Some features might work, some others might not

174
00:12:19,552 --> 00:12:23,396
or it might not work at all.
Then again, you can just go onto the net

175
00:12:23,431 --> 00:12:25,169
and look for the compatible adapters.

176
00:12:25,404 --> 00:12:27,775
You know, if you can't get this one, this one is like...

177
00:12:28,010 --> 00:12:31,657
I think I got this
for 20 bucks or something like that.

178
00:12:32,638 --> 00:12:35,141
Fairly good one, from Ebay.

179
00:12:35,176 --> 00:12:38,885
But you know, if you can find
something cheaper that works, feel free

180
00:12:39,520 --> 00:12:42,472
but I have not tested anything else out.

181
00:12:42,507 --> 00:12:44,326
I've just tested out this adapter,

182
00:12:44,361 --> 00:12:48,267
I've also tested out the
wireless card in my primary machine

183
00:12:49,759 --> 00:12:52,064
and some other things as well in terms of wireless

184
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:55,330
but as far as the USB
wireless adapters are concerned,

185
00:12:55,365 --> 00:12:57,449
this is the one that I have tested out.

186
00:12:57,884 --> 00:13:01,133
Anything else, I can't
make vouches that it will work,

187
00:13:01,368 --> 00:13:04,751
but, I mean, make the
checks for yourselves and see if both,

188
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:11,574
if this part says Yes and
if this column as well says Yes,

189
00:13:11,809 --> 00:13:14,844
then it should work. No big deal.

190
00:13:15,079 --> 00:13:19,016
So just go with whatever
option you feel the most comfortable with

191
00:13:20,679 --> 00:13:23,955
and keep in mind the cost,
so try to be cost-effective as well.

192
00:13:25,687 --> 00:13:27,375
Anyway, let's go ahead and

193
00:13:28,798 --> 00:13:31,615
plug it in, so just take the USB cable.

194
00:13:32,406 --> 00:13:34,463
All that I'm doing is taking a USB cable,

195
00:13:34,798 --> 00:13:38,689
I'm plugging it into the
adapter, that I got with the adapter.

196
00:13:38,924 --> 00:13:42,243
And then I'm gonna
spin it around and I'm gonna plug

197
00:13:42,278 --> 00:13:44,649
the USB adapter into the machine.

198
00:13:44,984 --> 00:13:48,722
This is the second time
in five minutes that I'm plugging it in,

199
00:13:48,857 --> 00:13:50,676
but I didn't really do
anything, I just tried plugging it in.

200
00:13:51,691 --> 00:13:54,091
So I'm just gonna plug it in to the machine

201
00:13:57,818 --> 00:14:01,549
and I hope that it's not dead.
That would be very nice if it's alive

202
00:14:02,603 --> 00:14:06,022
at least, because
I don't see a blue flashing light at all.

203
00:14:07,810 --> 00:14:09,819
I'm just gonna go ahead
and try plugging it into my laptop

204
00:14:09,854 --> 00:14:11,633
to see if it's actually alive,

205
00:14:13,124 --> 00:14:14,877
because I haven't used it for a while

206
00:14:16,383 --> 00:14:18,654
OK, so it is functional,
definitely I see a blue lamp.

207
00:14:19,605 --> 00:14:21,317
That part is obvious anyway.

208
00:14:22,815 --> 00:14:25,121
Let's go ahead and
plug it in and see what happens.

209
00:14:26,546 --> 00:14:28,117
Nothing, but well.

210
00:14:28,991 --> 00:14:31,235
Let's see if we can
manage to pass it through anyway.

211
00:14:31,570 --> 00:14:36,810
So I have the device
plugged in, all I did now is plug the device in.

212
00:14:36,845 --> 00:14:38,956
I did not install any drivers prior to this.

213
00:14:39,191 --> 00:14:45,413
I did not do anything other
than just plug the device into my Mac.

214
00:14:45,648 --> 00:14:49,850
That is all. Via the USB port
with a cable that came with the device.

215
00:14:49,885 --> 00:14:51,458
That is all. Nothing else.

216
00:14:53,699 --> 00:14:55,759
And this is the first time
that I'm pretty much doing this.

217
00:14:58,206 --> 00:15:03,297
Let's go ahead and
click here, Settings, go into Ports

218
00:15:04,683 --> 00:15:07,976
USB, it's 2.0 EHC Controller.

219
00:15:08,459 --> 00:15:11,826
Click on the plus sign and 11n USB.

220
00:15:12,113 --> 00:15:14,303
Let's select that and click on OK.

221
00:15:14,538 --> 00:15:18,433
Now let's power the
Kali machine up and see what happens.

222
00:15:18,668 --> 00:15:22,500
OK, excellent, so my USB is now blue.

223
00:15:24,651 --> 00:15:29,065
The blue lamp is on.
Notice that I did not install anything on Mac.

224
00:15:29,100 --> 00:15:32,912
I did not install any drivers,
the Mac did not recognise this device,

225
00:15:32,947 --> 00:15:35,352
Mac doesn't have a clue what this device is.

226
00:15:35,387 --> 00:15:38,559
It's just passing it
through, just as if it was a USB

227
00:15:38,894 --> 00:15:43,560
and it's passing it through
a VirtualBox to this virtual machine.

228
00:15:43,595 --> 00:15:45,146
That is all.

229
00:15:45,147 --> 00:15:48,052
Actually I couldn't use this device on
the Mac until I'd installed the drivers for it

230
00:15:48,187 --> 00:15:50,537
but I'm not gonna do that
because I'm never gonna use it on my Mac.

231
00:15:50,572 --> 00:15:53,411
What should I use this in a Mac for, anyway?

232
00:15:54,543 --> 00:15:57,329
So Control Shift +++ to magnify.

233
00:15:57,364 --> 00:16:01,260
I type in "ifconfig", press Enter, voilà.

234
00:16:01,295 --> 00:16:06,322
You have Wlan0. I am not connected to any networks

235
00:16:06,357 --> 00:16:11,007
but, I mean, it's
right there, I can use it, obviously.

236
00:16:13,023 --> 00:16:18,025
If I press this, Not connected. OK, obviously.

237
00:16:19,366 --> 00:16:23,435
Select a network. There we go,
so I have a tonload of networks

238
00:16:23,570 --> 00:16:26,936
around me that I can use to connect,

239
00:16:26,971 --> 00:16:28,873
and let me just go ahead and cancel this.

240
00:16:28,908 --> 00:16:31,530
I go into Network,
I'm gonna go into Network Settings.

241
00:16:31,565 --> 00:16:35,771
I'm gonna go into Network, and I'm gonna say,

242
00:16:35,806 --> 00:16:39,080
you see, where it says
Bridged Adapter, I'm gonna say "not attached".

243
00:16:39,115 --> 00:16:43,282
So it's not attached to any
of the integrated adapters in the machine,

244
00:16:43,317 --> 00:16:45,713
doesn't care, doesn't matter.

245
00:16:45,748 --> 00:16:48,605
This is gonna bring the
internet connection down completely

246
00:16:48,640 --> 00:16:51,055
in terms of wired connection. I'm doing this

247
00:16:53,301 --> 00:16:56,309
so that I can demonstrate
that this wireless adapter actually works.

248
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:01,419
And I'm gonna try to ping google.com,

249
00:17:01,654 --> 00:17:05,129
now this is not gonna
work out, as you might imagine.

250
00:17:05,564 --> 00:17:08,575
I'm just gonna Control+C to quit.

251
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:12,968
Now what I shall do is just
go into the Network manager here,

252
00:17:13,003 --> 00:17:17,188
go into Wi-Fi, Select
a network. Select this network.

253
00:17:17,423 --> 00:17:21,196
Click on Connect, type in the password.

254
00:17:25,246 --> 00:17:27,562
Let it connect, I'm gonna
leave it to attempt of ping

255
00:17:27,597 --> 00:17:29,150
to see when it actually connects.

256
00:17:29,385 --> 00:17:32,665
Are you serious? Have I forgotten the password?

257
00:17:41,624 --> 00:17:44,196
You know, when you don't use
your own wireless for a very long time,

258
00:17:44,231 --> 00:17:45,992
you tend to forget the password, which is...

259
00:17:46,227 --> 00:17:49,428
It can be very frustrating, to say the least.

260
00:17:58,265 --> 00:18:00,340
Please, tell me it's this one. There we go!

261
00:18:01,446 --> 00:18:05,409
So ping google.com
has managed to pass through successfully.

262
00:18:07,212 --> 00:18:11,024
I'm still having some difficulties,
it could be the range on this thing

263
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:12,943
because I'm sitting quite some distance away

264
00:18:13,178 --> 00:18:15,296
and this is a virtual
machine, so keep that in mind.

265
00:18:15,531 --> 00:18:19,102
And the ISP router
is utter junk, I can tell you that.

266
00:18:19,337 --> 00:18:22,809
But OK, the ping passed at least
once, so you know you at least have...

267
00:18:23,144 --> 00:18:26,762
Actually it didn't pass.
I did resolve the ip address,

268
00:18:26,797 --> 00:18:30,012
so that's something, right? Nope, doesn't wanna.

269
00:18:30,047 --> 00:18:32,430
OK, no big deal, we'll fix it.

270
00:18:34,481 --> 00:18:38,965
So it's pinged google but it's hilariously slow.

271
00:18:40,460 --> 00:18:42,475
Let's attempt to open up the browser

272
00:18:42,810 --> 00:18:45,029
and let's go to Udemy.

273
00:18:48,188 --> 00:18:52,406
Is it gonna open this site?
No, it will not open the site.

274
00:18:56,058 --> 00:18:58,089
This is good, that I've encountered a problem.

275
00:18:58,124 --> 00:19:00,223
This is bad, because I will need to make

276
00:19:00,258 --> 00:19:02,357
another tutorial on how to solve this.
