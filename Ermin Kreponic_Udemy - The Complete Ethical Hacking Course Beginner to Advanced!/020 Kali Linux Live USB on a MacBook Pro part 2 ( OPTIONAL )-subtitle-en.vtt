00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.067

Okay, so welcome back everybody.



2

00:00:02.102 --> 00:00:05.199

Now we're gonna have to do a few things



3

00:00:05.434 --> 00:00:07.800

in order to get this sorted and working.



4

00:00:08.235 --> 00:00:12.574

You might notice that

the unetbootin is no longer running.



5

00:00:12.709 --> 00:00:16.238

At the end of the

installation process I pressed on Exit



6

00:00:17.426 --> 00:00:20.942

but I did take a screenshot,

so this is what you will get.



7

00:00:22.520 --> 00:00:25.394

Hold on. There you go.



8

00:00:25.429 --> 00:00:28.215

So, lots of things here in the background:



9

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.000

forums, I am running through things,



10

00:00:32.135 --> 00:00:34.718

downloading things, going insane, berserk.



11

00:00:34.853 --> 00:00:39.083

But no big deal, here it says

"downloading", "extracting",



12

00:00:39.218 --> 00:00:42.321

"installing", "installation complete".

And down below, look, it says...



13

00:00:43.694 --> 00:00:45.825

Actually this is a screenshot

from the previous attempts,



14

00:00:46.933 --> 00:00:50.376

doesn't really matter, you're

going to get the same exact message.



15

00:00:51.998 --> 00:00:53.532

This is the point, the moral of the story.



16

00:00:53.667 --> 00:00:56.842

It will say that the created

USB device will not boot off of a Mac.



17

00:00:56.897 --> 00:01:01.313

"Insert it into a PC and select

the USB boot option in the BIOS boot menu."



18

00:01:01.448 --> 00:01:03.431

So this is true, this is completely true.



19

00:01:03.466 --> 00:01:06.804

The unetbootin has told you that this USB will not,



20

00:01:07.039 --> 00:01:10.520

I mean, will not work on

a Mac and it doesn't matter which



21

00:01:11.260 --> 00:01:13.535

is a 2013, 14, 15,



22

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:16.290

or 2009, 10, 11, whatever.



23

00:01:16.325 --> 00:01:20.650

Completely irrelevant.

This USB will not work as it is.



24

00:01:20.785 --> 00:01:23.448

We need to modify it,

we need to play around with it



25

00:01:23.583 --> 00:01:25.092

in order to make it functional.



26

00:01:25.776 --> 00:01:28.293

Let's go ahead and close

this image, as we no longer need it



27

00:01:28.428 --> 00:01:33.279

and let's open up our file

manager, Finder, as it is called on Mac



28

00:01:33.614 --> 00:01:37.934

and go to the partition

that we have just modified.



29

00:01:39.519 --> 00:01:42.756

This Efi folder, I've created it a moment ago



30

00:01:42.891 --> 00:01:45.676

when I was attempting to

do this video but failed miserably.



31

00:01:45.911 --> 00:01:48.360

I'm gonna go ahead and say "move to Trash".



32

00:01:48.495 --> 00:01:50.485

You're not gonna have it in the first place,



33

00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:53.474

so I have removed it completely.



34

00:01:54.438 --> 00:01:57.449

What I need to do now is go ahead and say



35

00:01:57.584 --> 00:02:01.054

new folder, type in "Efi", Enter.



36

00:02:02.088 --> 00:02:04.633

And then I need to enter Efi and



37

00:02:06.488 --> 00:02:09.526

go into new folder and type in "Boot",



38

00:02:10.632 --> 00:02:12.411

and then I'm gonna go into Boot.



39

00:02:12.446 --> 00:02:15.086

Well, actually, I didn't need to go into Boot.



40

00:02:16.617 --> 00:02:19.561

That's it, that's what you need

to do. Just create those folders.



41

00:02:22.385 --> 00:02:25.218

It goes like this. This is

the folder tray that you need,



42

00:02:25.253 --> 00:02:28.030

so Efi and then Boot. In the root.



43

00:02:28.065 --> 00:02:30.924

So in the root of the USB, on the first partition,



44

00:02:30.959 --> 00:02:32.915

which we have created, for me it's Untitled 1,



45

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:35.085

you might have labelled

it differently, doesn't matter.



46

00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:38.769

As I said, you have

freedom there, it does not affect it.



47

00:02:38.804 --> 00:02:42.442

It does not affect it in a technical

sense, the boot process, that much.



48

00:02:42.477 --> 00:02:44.895

It's gonna boot whether it's called Tralala



49

00:02:44.930 --> 00:02:47.404

or whether it's called

Untitled 1, completely irrelevant.



50

00:02:48.804 --> 00:02:51.874

It says here "Efi" and then here "Boot".



51

00:02:51.909 --> 00:02:54.295

This, you need to create.

Without this it will not work.



52

00:02:55.714 --> 00:02:58.890

The following files that

I will copy into the Boot folder



53

00:02:58.925 --> 00:03:02.982

will be provided to you either

on Udemy or links for downloads



54

00:03:03.117 --> 00:03:05.752

will be provided for them on Udemy,



55

00:03:05.887 --> 00:03:08.284

so you'll be able to download them from the net.



56

00:03:08.319 --> 00:03:11.421

I'm just gonna go ahead and

copy them from my other USB.



57

00:03:14.201 --> 00:03:17.148

There you go, so you need bootX64.efi,



58

00:03:17.383 --> 00:03:22.637

grub.cfg, grubx64.efi, MokManager.efi.



59

00:03:24.004 --> 00:03:27.889

One of these four is going

to work, the other ones will be pointless.



60

00:03:29.210 --> 00:03:32.571

Well, not pointless, but you

won't be able to boot from them,



61

00:03:32.906 --> 00:03:34.883

you won't be able to use them to boot,



62

00:03:35.414 --> 00:03:37.067

you will see what I mean in a moment.



63

00:03:38.140 --> 00:03:39.677

I'm just gonna say Copy 4 items.



64

00:03:39.912 --> 00:03:42.241

So the four items that I'm copying for here,



65

00:03:42.376 --> 00:03:44.372

as I said, they will be provided to you.



66

00:03:44.507 --> 00:03:48.376

You will be able to download

them, either through links or



67

00:03:48.411 --> 00:03:50.710

I will post the files directly on Udemy.



68

00:03:50.845 --> 00:03:52.426

I'll see if they allow me that.



69

00:03:53.409 --> 00:03:55.367

So, you will be able to get them from the net



70

00:03:55.502 --> 00:03:57.644

because, obviously, you

won't have them on your machine.



71

00:03:58.835 --> 00:04:00.875

Go back to the folder that you just created, Efi



72

00:04:00.910 --> 00:04:04.222

and then Boot. Go into Boot and say Paste 4 items.



73

00:04:05.559 --> 00:04:10.679

And there you go, so we have

four items that have been pasted here.



74

00:04:12.141 --> 00:04:14.109

Just need to leave them as such, no big deal.



75

00:04:15.226 --> 00:04:18.835

Now, if you have followed

the tutorials along the merry way,



76

00:04:18.970 --> 00:04:22.261

as I have shown them, in the

order in which they were given,



77

00:04:22.496 --> 00:04:25.368

if you have followed through

this whole section for a Mac



78

00:04:25.503 --> 00:04:29.555

on how to do this, on how to

first create a virtual machine,



79

00:04:29.890 --> 00:04:33.609

install it, etc. then this next

part won't be a problem to you.



80

00:04:33.844 --> 00:04:36.530

If it is a problem to you, if you're just going



81

00:04:36.665 --> 00:04:38.662

skipping through the

videos and going where you can



82

00:04:38.797 --> 00:04:41.509

or what you think is interesting, I would suggest



83

00:04:41.544 --> 00:04:45.153

to go back a few tutorials

within this section and have a look



84

00:04:45.188 --> 00:04:48.164

at how I have made this particular set-up.



85

00:04:49.998 --> 00:04:53.388

I'm stating this because I'm

about to open up a virtual machine



86

00:04:53.523 --> 00:04:57.146

and format a partition from within Kali.



87

00:04:59.648 --> 00:05:01.975

I have demonstrated how to create this set-up,



88

00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.194

now we're just going to utilize our set-up



89

00:05:05.329 --> 00:05:07.547

in the previous tutorials to our advantage.



90

00:05:08.209 --> 00:05:09.587

Go into Downloads... oh well.



91

00:05:10.746 --> 00:05:12.418

Sorry, not that, in the Applications folder.



92

00:05:12.868 --> 00:05:15.643

If you have followed everything

through, you will have VirtualBox here.



93

00:05:15.678 --> 00:05:17.762

Then open it up.



94

00:05:20.062 --> 00:05:23.872

And also, we're going to need to



95

00:05:24.919 --> 00:05:26.465

eject this device.



96

00:05:28.103 --> 00:05:29.683

Eject all. Yes, please.



97

00:05:32.867 --> 00:05:34.405

Again? Seriously?



98

00:05:41.266 --> 00:05:43.328

I'm definitely not using it.



99

00:05:51.258 --> 00:05:52.788

Let's go ahead and unmount it.



100

00:05:53.946 --> 00:05:57.319

Actually, this is not unmount,

this is eject, but fine, whatever.



101

00:06:00.082 --> 00:06:01.608

So it's ejected.



102

00:06:03.018 --> 00:06:04.583

Let's boot up Kali.



103

00:06:05.692 --> 00:06:07.387

Wait, wait, wait, wait...



104

00:06:10.443 --> 00:06:14.230

Go into Settings first, my apologies.



105

00:06:14.531 --> 00:06:19.354

Go to Ports, USB, USB 2,



106

00:06:19.589 --> 00:06:22.772

unless you're using a

USB 3.0, which is... I don't know,



107

00:06:23.207 --> 00:06:25.097

it is an overkill, but oh well.



108

00:06:25.232 --> 00:06:28.326

And then select the USB

that you want from this menu here.



109

00:06:28.461 --> 00:06:32.164

Actually, you first need to...

Forget about... Delete it completely.



110

00:06:32.199 --> 00:06:36.759

Click on the plus here

and select your USB from here,



111

00:06:38.164 --> 00:06:41.126

see it here and then go ahead and click on OK.



112

00:06:42.501 --> 00:06:44.865

Then eject this.



113

00:06:46.713 --> 00:06:48.534

Eject all.



114

00:06:51.101 --> 00:06:52.874

And then boot up Kali



115

00:06:55.378 --> 00:06:57.392

So this is a Kali virtual

machine which we have created



116

00:06:57.955 --> 00:07:00.144

in the previous tutorials. If you're just tuning in



117

00:07:00.179 --> 00:07:04.081

just go back a tutorial or two

and you'll see how this is done.



118

00:07:08.163 --> 00:07:10.389

The reason why I'm

doing this is because I cannot...



119

00:07:10.524 --> 00:07:13.904

I really don't know how...

I mean, I could basically go onto the net



120

00:07:14.039 --> 00:07:16.638

and figure it out, how to do it on a Mac but



121

00:07:16.773 --> 00:07:20.410

it's just so much easier

for me to do this on a Linux.



122

00:07:21.874 --> 00:07:25.576

and to format the partition

the way I want to format it.



123

00:07:25.611 --> 00:07:30.269

We're gonna use Gparted,

which is just so awesome of a tool



124

00:07:30.304 --> 00:07:33.534

that I have come to love

and admire over the years,



125

00:07:34.838 --> 00:07:36.656

to format our second partition.



126

00:07:39.204 --> 00:07:42.214

So we're just basically gonna do that.



127

00:07:51.103 --> 00:07:53.329

Come on, come on.



128

00:07:56.081 --> 00:08:00.483

Booting. Excellent. So you see,

I already have these two here.



129

00:08:02.079 --> 00:08:04.395

Kali can see both partitions without any problems.



130

00:08:04.430 --> 00:08:09.837

Now we're gonna open up

the terminal and type in "gparted".



131

00:08:28.079 --> 00:08:30.160

Okay, apparently, I cannot spell.



132

00:08:36.620 --> 00:08:40.207

In the upper right corner, select your USB device.



133

00:08:40.242 --> 00:08:43.028

Make sure that you have selected your USB device.



134

00:08:44.512 --> 00:08:47.040

Just take a look at the size

and that should help you out.



135

00:08:47.075 --> 00:08:50.089

So it will say that one partition is the boot



136

00:08:50.124 --> 00:08:54.084

and that the other one

is basically just some fat32



137

00:08:54.119 --> 00:08:55.937

and it's gonna say the size.



138

00:08:57.209 --> 00:08:58.934

Go ahead and unmount it.



139

00:09:01.353 --> 00:09:03.620

Unmounting, unmounting. Come on.



140

00:09:07.485 --> 00:09:09.421

Anytime, my good man, anytime.



141

00:09:09.456 --> 00:09:13.544

Go ahead and right click

on it again and say Format to,



142

00:09:13.679 --> 00:09:16.350

and we are going to...



143

00:09:17.791 --> 00:09:21.367

Actually, I'm gonna delete it first



144

00:09:22.361 --> 00:09:26.827

and then I'm gonna say New.



145

00:09:26.962 --> 00:09:30.526

Leave everything as it is, just right here



146

00:09:38.474 --> 00:09:42.816

casper-rw. Leave it as a primary partition,



147

00:09:42.951 --> 00:09:47.873

go ahead and click on Add

and then we're gonna go into



148

00:09:50.579 --> 00:09:53.896

Edit, Apply all operations.

Well, before we actually do that



149

00:09:55.378 --> 00:09:58.824

let's just be cheesy a little bit

and see if we can change the label



150

00:09:58.959 --> 00:10:00.636

since I was a genius who didn't change it



151

00:10:00.771 --> 00:10:04.340

and I like to complicate

things which will likely mess it up.



152

00:10:04.475 --> 00:10:06.220

I don't think I will be able to do this,



153

00:10:06.455 --> 00:10:08.478

but let's see if there is an option



154

00:10:11.486 --> 00:10:13.272

just to change the label of the device.



155

00:10:15.232 --> 00:10:17.424

I probably can but I need to reformat it.



156

00:10:19.479 --> 00:10:23.159

Forget about it, I'm not

gonna ruin this session with that.



157

00:10:24.675 --> 00:10:26.863

But doesn't really matter, I've unmounted it,



158

00:10:26.898 --> 00:10:28.564

it says "creating primary partition"



159

00:10:28.799 --> 00:10:34.671

"ext4,49.78" that's 50 gigs, "on /dev/sdb".



160

00:10:35.745 --> 00:10:38.593

Fantastic, so I didn't

really feel like reformatting this



161

00:10:38.628 --> 00:10:41.666

and going straight in the

beginning just because it says Untitled 1.



162

00:10:41.801 --> 00:10:44.366

Sure it's nicer when it says Kali, but live with it.



163

00:10:44.501 --> 00:10:46.426

I mean, if you want to change it, feel free.



164

00:10:47.971 --> 00:10:49.582

Feel free to change it at the beginning



165

00:10:49.617 --> 00:10:52.286

or go through the procedure

again, doesn't really matter at all.



166

00:10:52.421 --> 00:10:57.611

Now that all of this

is done, we're gonna say Quit.



167

00:10:57.746 --> 00:11:01.604

We're gonna close the virtual machine



168

00:11:03.732 --> 00:11:05.741

and we're gonna close...



169

00:11:06.958 --> 00:11:08.639

sure we can close this as well.



170

00:11:08.774 --> 00:11:12.387

And in the follow-up tutorial we shall install



171

00:11:12.622 --> 00:11:16.624

another thing from the net.

Again, I shall provide the links for this



172

00:11:16.659 --> 00:11:20.473

or the download itself,

which we will be able to utilize



173

00:11:20.608 --> 00:11:24.131

in order to create

the boot, which will be the third



174

00:11:24.166 --> 00:11:26.545

and hopefully, the final portion of this series.



175

00:11:26.680 --> 00:11:28.505

If you're wondering why I'm fragmenting them so



176

00:11:28.540 --> 00:11:31.143

it's because I have

certain time limitations for videos



177

00:11:31.478 --> 00:11:33.755

when I put them on Udemy.



178

00:11:33.790 --> 00:11:36.423

Until then, I bid you all farewell.
