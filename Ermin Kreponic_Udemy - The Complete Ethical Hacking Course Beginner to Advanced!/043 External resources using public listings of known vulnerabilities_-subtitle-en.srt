1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,600
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:08,800
Today I will show you a little bit more stuff that you can do Nmap

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:11,000
but more importantly than that

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:19,000
I will show you a tool which you can use to assign a physical location, namely a city, to an IP address.

5
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:21,800
It's relatively precise and it's relatively good

6
00:00:21,800 --> 00:00:28,000
but the downside of it is that you can only make 1000 queries per day

7
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:30,200
which is still very reasonable

8
00:00:30,200 --> 00:00:32,710
I mean, 1000 queries per day is a pretty good thing.

9
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,200
However, if you're doing some sort of mass scanning or something like that

10
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:37,100
it won't really help you.

11
00:00:37,100 --> 00:00:41,000
You will need to go online and download the libraries for that

12
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:43,200
but 1000 is a very good number

13
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,200
and let me just show you how it actually works.

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:48,500
So here I have a command

15
00:00:48,500 --> 00:00:55,200
This is the command that I've used to scan scanme.nmap.org and to get some information from it.

16
00:00:55,200 --> 00:01:02,300
So it's "curl ipinfo.io/ ", and then you get an IP address here.

17
00:01:02,300 --> 00:01:03,600
It's a curl script

18
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:06,000
So let me just copy/paste that here

19
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:08,500
and this is the command -- curl

20
00:01:08,500 --> 00:01:12,000
This is the argument that you are passing  through it, along with the IP address.

21
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,600
Once you press ENTER, it queries the server

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:16,200
and there you go.

23
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,000
You have an IP and you have a host.

24
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:21,000
You get a host name as well.

25
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:23,700
You get a city -- It's Fremont

26
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,600
It's region is California, country is US

27
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:29,150
you even get some coordinates here

28
00:01:29,150 --> 00:01:33,100
organization, postal code, and so on and so forth.

29
00:01:33,100 --> 00:01:37,900
So you get some really useful information here, in regards to an IP address

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:42,400
but as I said, the downside is that you can make 1000 queries per day

31
00:01:42,400 --> 00:01:45,200
So you're not doing anything illegal here or anything of a kind.

32
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,000
You are simply querying a database somewhere in the world

33
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:51,600
to give you a specific information on an IP address.

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,000
You could have done this by simply typing on the net "Who is"

35
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,800
However, I wish to teach you how to do these things in the terminal

36
00:01:57,800 --> 00:02:03,000
so that you will be less dependent on the browser or things of a kind.

37
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,030
Anyway, let me just go ahead and clear this.

38
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:10,000
Now what I wanted to discuss with you today are some external resources

39
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:12,800
which you can use in combination with Nmap.

40
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,200
Nmap has a wide variety of scripts that are applicable to it

41
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:19,400
and then you will be able to use nmap

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:25,000
in order to scan for particular vulnerabilities on the servers elsewhere in the world.

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,580
So just go ahead and open up your browser.

44
00:02:28,580 --> 00:02:32,000
Okay, so I have this website -- scanme.nmap.org

45
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:33,200
open here

46
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,700
and on that website, there is a link

47
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,100
It's nmap.org

48
00:02:37,100 --> 00:02:39,500
and then some link here.

49
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:42,250
You can just copy/paste this if you wish, or something of a kind.

50
00:02:42,250 --> 00:02:47,700
Just read through it and then navigate over on their website

51
00:02:47,700 --> 00:02:49,200
but it's not really that hard.

52
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,300
I'm here on nmap's website

53
00:02:53,300 --> 00:02:59,200
and I have a list of categories of what sort of scripts can I run with nmap

54
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:04,200
in order to scan for particular vulnerabilities.

55
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:11,400
So there are 490 scripts, which is a lot.

56
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:15,300
For DoS, for denial of service attacks

57
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:16,910
those sort of vulnerabilities

58
00:03:16,910 --> 00:03:18,000
for exploits

59
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,239
for, I don't know, for brute forcing, for identification. etc.

60
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:27,200
Anyway, let's just go and click on one of them.

61
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,209
Pretty much any will do. It's not a problem.

62
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:34,200
I'm gonna go ahead and click on vuln...some general thing

63
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:37,000
and now I have all these things here.

64
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:40,700
So if you're wondering "Well, how can I bypass firewall rules?"

65
00:03:40,700 --> 00:03:41,800
Well, simply use a script.

66
00:03:41,800 --> 00:03:45,200
It says "firewall-bypass"

67
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:52,700
Detects vulnerabilities in netfilter and other firewalls that use helpers to dynamically open ports for protocols...

68
00:03:52,700 --> 00:03:54,600
...such as ftp and sip.

69
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:57,500
So this is going to help in a good amount of cases.

70
00:03:57,500 --> 00:04:03,000
You can go ahead and open new tab

71
00:04:03,000 --> 00:04:09,290
and once you click on it, you'll get the exact syntax how to use it.

72
00:04:09,290 --> 00:04:10,800
"Example Usage"

73
00:04:10,800 --> 00:04:12,900
It gives you the exact syntax.

74
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:15,800
There is nothing different that you need to do here.

75
00:04:15,800 --> 00:04:23,000
Instead of <target>, just type in the IP address, and that's it.

76
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:28,000
Literally that is only thing that you need to change here.

77
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,600
Just copy this command

78
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,300
and then just change the last thing into the IP address that you wish to scan.

79
00:04:37,300 --> 00:04:40,200
Now I'm not going to go through all of them.

80
00:04:40,200 --> 00:04:43,300
As I said, there are 490 scripts.

81
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:46,790
We will be using some of them, however, in the later tutorials

82
00:04:46,790 --> 00:04:52,400
where you will get some clear demonstrations, once we actually start attacking particular services

83
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,700
and start exploiting their vulnerabilities.

84
00:04:55,700 --> 00:04:59,100
However, again, I won't go through all 490 of them

85
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:02,000
because the course would be ridiculously long

86
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:07,000
but you can go to the Nmap website, find this...

87
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:14,400
So look -- You have security tools, security list, scanners, etc

88
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:17,500
There are so many resources here that you can use

89
00:05:17,500 --> 00:05:22,000
and I strongly advise you to go on to this website and check it out

90
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,200
but just take a look...

91
00:05:23,200 --> 00:05:27,700
This is probably the most important part for you and for everybody on this website

92
00:05:27,700 --> 00:05:30,600
is the availability of these scripts.

93
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,000
So just take a look at what they do and what you can do with them

94
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:38,300
primarily because you can save yourself a ton load of time

95
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:41,370
by just conducting a scan for certain types of exploits.

96
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:44,600
If I click on exploits, it gives me all sorts of exploits.

97
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:50,000
So for example, if I'm attacking a very secure file transfer protocol

98
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,710
just read through it.

99
00:05:53,710 --> 00:06:02,000
It explains in great detail what it does

100
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,500
Literally the exact syntax which you need to use.

101
00:06:05,500 --> 00:06:11,570
Right next to it, you just type in the IP address of whatever host you want and that's it.

102
00:06:11,570 --> 00:06:15,000
There are no changes, there is nothing else that you need to do

103
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,000
you just copy/paste this and change the name here.

104
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:25,300
Anyway, I'm just gonna go scroll up

105
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:28,530
and then I have yet another website that I wish to show you.

106
00:06:28,530 --> 00:06:30,500
It's called ExploitDB

107
00:06:30,500 --> 00:06:35,000
So just type in "exploitdb"

108
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:39,800
and the first sighted that pops up -- Exploit Database by Offensive Security

109
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,000
Click on it

110
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:48,200
This is pretty much one of the largest databases out there, in regards to vulnerabilities.

111
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:51,000
You can find them all in one place here.

112
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,400
There are literally here.

113
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:55,860
There are some very nice Wireless tricks that you can do here --

114
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:00,300
Reverse shells, privilege escalation...pretty much everything.

115
00:07:00,300 --> 00:07:04,500
We will be using this site extensively in the follow-up tutorials

116
00:07:04,500 --> 00:07:05,800
in other chapters as well

117
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,400
but I just wanted to mention it here, primarily so that you can explore it a little bit

118
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:12,600
and I strongly do advise you to do it.

119
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,900
Just go through the website.

120
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:18,000
For example, take a look at the router did you are using.

121
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,600
Just see what sort of a router you're using.

122
00:07:20,600 --> 00:07:24,000
See what sort of a router was provided to you by the ISP provider

123
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:35,000
and then go ahead and click on Search in the top menu

124
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:38,200
and search for the vulnerabilities of your home router.

125
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,400
See what you can do with it.

126
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:44,800
You can look at by port.

127
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,500
There is a free text search, description, author

128
00:07:48,500 --> 00:07:52,000
Look how many platforms are down there.

129
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:56,700
If you don't know what platform it is, just try a free search thing

130
00:07:56,700 --> 00:07:58,800
type in the name of your router

131
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,500
type that in free search text

132
00:08:00,500 --> 00:08:03,300
and it's bound to give you some vulnerabilities

133
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:08,520
because pretty much all the home routers have more vulnerabilities than they should.

134
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:11,000
So that is a task that I leave you with.

135
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,200
I want you to open up this website -- Exploit Database

136
00:08:15,200 --> 00:08:19,800
find the vulnerability of your home router

137
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:22,000
figure out which one it is first.

138
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,000
Usually you can do this by just looking at the box of the router

139
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:32,500
and once you found the vulnerability, there will be a description on how to use it.

140
00:08:32,500 --> 00:08:35,000
Try using it, try exploiting it

141
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,400
If it fails, and it probably won't

142
00:08:37,400 --> 00:08:41,600
because all you need to do is copy/paste things into the Linux terminal

143
00:08:41,600 --> 00:08:46,000
and we're gonna do some demonstrations later on along the way

144
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,700
as we do some more complex stuff

145
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:50,300
but before we do it, I want you to try it

146
00:08:50,300 --> 00:08:53,600
and if you have any questions, post them in the question section.

147
00:08:53,600 --> 00:09:01,000
I will be more than happy to not only answer them, but also to help you through the process as well

148
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:03,100
in terms of instructing you or something like that.

149
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:04,500
You don't need to pay anything extra for that.

150
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:07,580
I will do it gladly and help you out

151
00:09:07,580 --> 00:09:09,220
but please give it a shot.

152
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:14,200
Try it first and then continue up the tutorial, see what I do

153
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,000
then perhaps you can fix your technique and improve yourselves.

154
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:22,000
Before I leave, just one more time

155
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:28,000
Over here, you have scripts that you can use with Nmap to detect particular vulnerabilities.

156
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:29,000
Just click on it.

00:09:29,000 --> 00:09:31,200
Once you click on it, you will get the exact syntax.

158
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,900
All you need to do is change the IP address and type in "exploitdb"

Use this website extensively.

160
00:09:38,400 --> 00:09:41,170
It is very good and there are lots of vulnerabilities on it.

161
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:43,000
Pretty much all of them are located there.

162
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:44,500
It is completely free.

163
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:50,000

and with that, I will leave you today

167
00:09:57,300 --> 00:10:00,300
and one more time, I will urge you to try it yourselves

168
00:10:00,300 --> 00:10:03,100
and then continue on with the course where I do it myself

169
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:08,500
and then you can see the particularities and the fine details of how it is done.

170
00:10:08,500 --> 00:10:11,000
I bid you farewell and until next time.
