00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.130

Welcome back all, today I'm just gonna go ahead and continue with the MAC changer



2

00:00:06.130 --> 00:00:14.246

Now, in this lecture I will actually use it and I will show you how to change your MAC address



3

00:00:14.246 --> 00:00:24.829

this is primarily meant to be applied in real life circumstances and since these are only learning and training



4

00:00:24.829 --> 00:00:29.927

videos, since this is for learning purposes and these are only training videos,



5

00:00:29.927 --> 00:00:35.189

we're going to do it in the virtual machine, keep in mind that even though this is possible to do



6

00:00:35.189 --> 00:00:43.003

from the Linux command line within the virtual machine it will effectively kill your internet connectivity



7

00:00:43.003 --> 00:00:53.190

on the virtual machine, on real machines or bootable USBs it won't because how it is meant to be used



8

00:00:53.190 --> 00:01:03.428

I will show you how you can also change a MAC address in virtual box without actually losing internet connectivity



9

00:01:03.428 --> 00:01:20.894

Anyway, let just type in "macchanger -r eth0" which is



10

00:01:03.428 --> 00:01:20.894

our interface, actually before that, let's type in



11

00:01:20.894 --> 00:01:33.861

"ifconfig eth0" and we see the MAC address here, I've already changed it but let's revert it back..



12

00:01:33.861 --> 00:01:46.737

let's just go ahead and continue, let's change it again, so let's type in "macchanger - r eth0"



13

00:01:46.737 --> 00:01:55.821

Enter, so it says Permanent MAC, this is our original MAC address, this is the current MAC address which



14

00:01:55.821 --> 00:02:00.554

I've changed it prior to the beggining of this tutorial, and this is the new MAC address



15

00:02:00.554 --> 00:02:08.972

When it says New MAC address, yep, there we go, this is the one that shall be used



16

00:02:08.972 --> 00:02:15.443

So new MAC address is the one that will be used, permanent MAC address is the original one



17

00:02:15.443 --> 00:02:22.070

and the current one, the one that is currently being used is this one, but as soon as you have a new one



18

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:33.739

then this will be applied, let me show you, so "ifconfig eth0", and you can see that this one



19

00:02:33.739 --> 00:02:42.929

this output and this output are completely the same, but as you can see I can type in



20

00:02:42.929 --> 00:02:59.097

"ping google.com" and this is not going to work, If I type in "macchanger -p" to restore the permanent one



21

00:02:59.097 --> 00:03:06.857

If I type in "ping google.com" you see that the internet connection does work



22

00:03:06.857 --> 00:03:11.993

So you won't have this problem on the physical machine or with the bootable USB



23

00:03:11.993 --> 00:03:20.374

There will be no difficulties there whatsoever but with a virtual machine is a little bit different



24

00:03:20.374 --> 00:03:25.430

If you wish to change it in a virtual machine and if you're using virtual box, it fairly simple but I



25

00:03:25.430 --> 00:03:33.240

as I already stated it makes little sense because the address is already fairly...



26

00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.990

I mean, it's basically the MAC address of the virtual machine, who cares?



27

00:03:37.990 --> 00:03:45.622

It's not like, It's a machine that you bought with your own money somewhere or something like that, it's the MAC



28

00:03:45.622 --> 00:03:51.309

address of the virtual machine, so who cares? so just from a logical perspective it makes little sense



29

00:03:51.309 --> 00:03:56.264

but let me show you in case you really want you



30

00:03:56.264 --> 00:04:08.780

Ok, so go ahead and clear the screen and I can type in... So this one is 08:00:27:03:5a:75



31

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:18.167

feel free to memorize it, feel free not to memorize it.



32

00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:18.167

You can remember the last set so it's 75 and let's see how that changes



33

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:34.332

So the very first thing we need to do is completely power off our machine,



34

00:04:18.167 --> 00:04:34.332

power off the virtual machine that is. Just wait for it



35

00:04:34.332 --> 00:04:45.791

And there we go, so let's right click on our virtual machine, go to settings, go into network



36

00:04:45.791 --> 00:04:50.997

let's change it to bridge, go into Advanced, it doesn't need to be in bridge,



37

00:04:50.997 --> 00:04:57.794

you can leave it in NAT if you wish, just so you know.



38

00:04:57.794 --> 00:05:09.239

So promiscuous mode allowed all and down below I have a MAC address



39

00:04:57.794 --> 00:05:09.239

and now let's go ahead and rotate it, let's change it to something else



40

00:05:09.239 --> 00:05:24.501

So you see it's randomizing these bits here... yeah, you won't be able to change manufacturer from here



41

00:05:24.501 --> 00:05:32.493

You'll just be able to randomize the device bits, so the manufacturer remains the same



42

00:05:32.493 --> 00:05:40.434

but the device bits will change completely, but either way you are fairly anonymous anyway



43

00:05:41.094 --> 00:05:53.850

but using a virtual machine so no worries there, just go ahead and click on Ok



44

00:05:57.610 --> 00:06:03.634

Are you serious? Please?



45

00:06:19.884 --> 00:06:27.930

I love it when it bugs out like this, it's something that I love the most



46

00:06:27.930 --> 00:06:35.897

Ok, so once again, going to settings and go into network, I'm gonna go ahead and switch to bridge



47

00:06:35.897 --> 00:06:45.260

go into Advanced, click on this green circle to change the MAC address, click on Ok



48

00:06:45.260 --> 00:06:50.511

and then you can power the machine on and the MAC address will be changed



49

00:06:50.511 --> 00:07:02.179

So you can't change the manufacturer but you can change the bits identify the machine



50

00:07:02.179 --> 00:07:12.226

However as I said, it's just a virtual machine so no need to pretty much worry at all, it can be deleted any time you wish and you can create a new one



51

00:07:12.226 --> 00:07:22.762

Anytime you wish, but on a real system and on a bootable USB this would make a lot of difference



52

00:07:22.762 --> 00:07:27.945

So every time you're gonna use this in the real world this would make a lot of difference, but on a virtual machine



53

00:07:27.945 --> 00:07:40.674

which you're using now, for learning purposes I'm just demonstrating it so you know how to do it



54

00:07:40.674 --> 00:07:48.425

Ok so booting in, booting and booting and booting really slowly



55

00:07:48.425 --> 00:07:59.969

I've always loved the speed of virtual machines, just close this and close this and open up our terminal



56

00:07:59.969 --> 00:08:07.838

there is another thing that can be implemented and Linux allows for scheduling of tasks so you can



57

00:08:07.838 --> 00:08:16.233

schedule a task, you run at boot time so you can have your MAC address changed every time you boot



58

00:08:16.233 --> 00:08:29.926

your machine so if you type in "crontab -e" in Kali Linux 2.0 it's gonna ask you which editor would you



59

00:08:29.926 --> 00:08:39.560

like to use. I've always liked to use VIM but I've noticed that people have had problems with to put it on udemy



60

00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:46.941

because it can be quite a bit complicated but it is very powerful however for this purpose I'm gonna use



61

00:08:46.941 --> 00:08:55.847

Nano as it is a lot simpler and easier to use and by far less powerful although for this purpose



62

00:08:55.847 --> 00:09:00.728

we just need a basic editor to change a few things so there's no need to use a very powerful tool



63

00:09:00.728 --> 00:09:04.335

in the first place.



64

00:09:04.335 --> 00:09:12.781

So let's go ahead and, let's pick and option, number 1



65

00:09:12.781 --> 00:09:21.071

And let's go down, so at the bottom you have "m h dom mon dow comand" so what are these options?



66

00:09:28.825 --> 00:09:42.514

M stands for minutes, H stands for hours dom is day of the month, mon is just month and dw is day of the week



67

00:09:42.514 --> 00:09:51.994

and the command that you wish to run, so in a physical or a USB device, you can run something like this



68

00:09:51.994 --> 00:10:02.526

"@reboot" so you disregard these options completely and you just state "@reboot" and then you could



69

00:10:02.526 --> 00:10:11.869

type in something like ''macchanger -r eth0''



70

00:10:11.869 --> 00:10:19.193

you could also bring the interface down and change the MAC address if that doesn't work



71

00:10:19.193 --> 00:10:27.850

so for example you have ''@reboot macchanger -r eth0'' this should work, if it does not



72

00:10:27.850 --> 00:10:34.746

you can do the following



73

00:10:34.746 --> 00:10:44.089

So we're somewhere on the file system, let's go into Documents and we can type in



74

00:10:44.089 --> 00:10:54.585

''mkdir" I don't know, how should we name this file? "whatever.sh"



75

00:10:54.585 --> 00:10:59.522

and then we're gonna type in ''nano whatever.sh''



76

00:10:59.522 --> 00:11:08.596

No, wait, mkdir creates a directory, my sincere apologies for that



77

00:11:08.596 --> 00:11:18.391

I'm just gonna go ahead and type in ''nano whatever.sh'' and then I'm gonna create a small script



78

00:11:18.391 --> 00:11:28.833

for myself here /bin/bash and then you can type in a set of commands basically



79

00:11:28.833 --> 00:11:32.742

exactly the same commands that you would use in the terminal so,



80

00:11:32.742 --> 00:11:42.301

ifconfig eth0 down



81

00:11:47.081 --> 00:11:55.421

Notice also that this is primarily used for wireless interfaces and I am using a wired interface



82

00:11:55.421 --> 00:12:01.623

for these tests so, also you want generally change the MAC address on a wired interface



83

00:12:01.623 --> 00:12:07.691

you would generally change it on a wireless interface, but the procedure is exactly the same



84

00:12:07.691 --> 00:12:13.378

the only thing that differs is the name of the interface, so you don't need to copy this part



85

00:12:13.378 --> 00:12:17.858

or anything like that, I'm just creating this script for demonstration purposes



86

00:12:17.858 --> 00:12:22.913

of what you can do, so you can create entire sets of commands but you want to be executed



87

00:12:22.913 --> 00:12:30.800

at boot time, you configure your system to tune your system the way you want it to be tuned



88

00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:36.774

at boot time, so you wouldn't have to do it every time manually, so you could automate the tasks



89

00:12:36.774 --> 00:12:43.233

type in back maccchanger -r eth0



90

00:12:43.233 --> 00:12:49.043

and then ifconfig eth0 up



91

00:12:49.043 --> 00:13:09.742

and you can also to ensure that it runs smoothly, you type in sleep 2, and we can do this



92

00:13:09.742 --> 00:13:21.789

as well, sleep 2, sleep just puts the execution of... executes ifconfig then sleeps for 2 seconds



93

00:13:21.789 --> 00:13:26.218

then executes the macchanger, then sleeps for 2 seconds and then it brings



94

00:13:26.218 --> 00:13:31.972

the interface back up, this is just to ensure that everything runs smoothly



95

00:13:31.972 --> 00:13:41.867

So Control + O to save, Enter, Control + X to exit, then we do ls, we see the script is there



96

00:13:41.867 --> 00:13:52.032

and now we, we need to make it executable, so type in chmod +x whatever.sh



97

00:13:52.032 --> 00:13:59.359

and then if we do ls again you will see that it's a different color, and you can see that



98

00:13:59.359 --> 00:14:05.379

it is indeed an executable file, this x symbolizes that it is executable,



99

00:14:05.379 --> 00:14:11.377

so the first three are for the user, the second three permissions are for the group



100

00:14:11.377 --> 00:14:18.725

and then third three permissions are for everybody so the user can read, write and execute



101

00:14:18.725 --> 00:14:27.496

the owner of the file is root, the group to which root belongs is called root as well



102

00:14:27.496 --> 00:14:33.600

so the root group can read and execute but it cannot write



103

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:40.117

Yeah, but if you're root you can do pretty much anything, so if there's another user



104

00:14:40.117 --> 00:14:46.711

Let's say... user called test, that is a member of the root group, he would be able to read,



105

00:14:46.711 --> 00:14:53.183

and execute the file, so read and execute, but it wouldn't be able to write anything



106

00:14:53.183 --> 00:15:00.900

to it, and the rwxr also can read and execute, so everybody else belongs to any other group



107

00:15:00.900 --> 00:15:05.793

Anyway, I know the type perhaps lost you a little bit there, but no worries, this will



108

00:15:05.793 --> 00:15:17.711

clear out the tutorial progresses, let's go ahead and type in crontab -e



109

00:15:17.711 --> 00:15:23.847

Notice how I didn't get prompted for an editor this time, scroll down to the bottom



110

00:15:23.847 --> 00:15:41.206

type in pwd to see that you're currently working in directory, so it's root and then Documents



111

00:15:41.206 --> 00:15:57.771

feel free to copy this, so Control + Shift + C, and then let's go ahead and type in crontab -e once again



112

00:15:57.771 --> 00:16:12.543

Scroll down to the bottom, type in @reboot /root/Documents (with Control + Shift + V) and then whatever.sh



113

00:16:12.543 --> 00:16:19.090

so I haven't really tested this out in this machine but it should work without difficulties and you can



114

00:16:19.090 --> 00:16:25.883

press Control + O to save, Enter to write and Control + X to exit



115

00:16:25.883 --> 00:16:35.546

If I type in ifconfig I can see that the last set of the address is e7:43 let's test the script



116

00:16:35.546 --> 00:16:44.690

to see if it actually works, "sleep is not functional", okay, no big deal, but you can see that



117

00:16:44.690 --> 00:16:53.383

it works even without sleep quite well so the current MAC and the permanent MAC and the new MAC



118

00:16:53.383 --> 00:17:01.484

you can see that it has indeed changed it, let me just reconfigure this a little bit



119

00:17:01.484 --> 00:17:11.802

should've used a capital S just lower case S if I'm not mistaken, if it doesn't no big deal



120

00:17:11.802 --> 00:17:16.954

There you go, you've noticed that the execution of this script was a bit slower because you had



121

00:17:16.954 --> 00:17:24.823

sleep intervals of 2 seconds but indeed again it changes and it will change it every time it reboots



122

00:17:24.823 --> 00:17:29.412

we can make sure of this by just typing in reboot



123

00:17:29.412 --> 00:17:38.370

Running a bit short of time here but well, we should wrap the tutorial up fairly soon



124

00:17:38.370 --> 00:17:46.343

You can put in anything you want in that script so it will, it should run every time that the machine



125

00:17:46.343 --> 00:17:53.882

reboots which is very nice as I said, you can have a preconfigured machine in one single script



126

00:17:53.882 --> 00:18:01.128

so you can change your DNS settings, you can connect to a VPN, you can do whatever



127

00:18:01.128 --> 00:18:06.646

it is that you want to do and put it in one script that will run every time that you boot



128

00:18:06.646 --> 00:18:11.191

so everything will be like 2 seconds instead if you go in manually from here to there



129

00:18:11.191 --> 00:18:14.194

configuring that, ect.



130

00:18:28.254 --> 00:18:42.043

Booting, give me the terminal, zoom, and let's type in macchanger -s eth0



131

00:18:42.043 --> 00:18:46.882

and there we go, so it says that the current MAC is this one and the permanent MAC



132

00:18:46.882 --> 00:18:51.107

is this one so indeed has changed it at reboot



133

00:18:51.107 --> 00:18:55.739

Anyway, I thank you for watching, this will conclude the Macchanger Section



134

00:18:55.739 --> 00:19:02.328

I hope that you have enjoyed it and I bid you all farewell.
