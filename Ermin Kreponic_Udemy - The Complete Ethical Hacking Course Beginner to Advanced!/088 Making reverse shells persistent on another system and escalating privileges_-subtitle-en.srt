1
00:00:01,190 --> 00:00:02,780
Welcome back, everybody.

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:05,420
Today we're just gonna continue
from where we left off.

3
00:00:05,420 --> 00:00:09,790
I am going to do a couple of
things with Metasploit, and

4
00:00:09,790 --> 00:00:16,060
those will include making our reverse
shells persistent on another system and

5
00:00:16,060 --> 00:00:21,950
escalating privileges in order to do that,
because we do need an elevated

6
00:00:21,950 --> 00:00:26,897
set of privileges to do certain
things on a system elsewhere.

7
00:00:26,897 --> 00:00:30,548
Now, I can just see the question
in the discussions now,

8
00:00:30,548 --> 00:00:33,300
can we actually do a remote desktop?

9
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,078
Yes, you can actually have a desktop
of another person being displayed on

10
00:00:38,078 --> 00:00:42,404
your own screen but I strongly,
I strongly recommend against it.

11
00:00:42,404 --> 00:00:47,119
Okay, if you're doing this in LAN,
fine, it can pass, but

12
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:53,697
if you're doing this over the net, having
a remote desktop is a waste of bandwidth.

13
00:00:53,697 --> 00:00:55,980
I mean, complete waste of bandwidth.

14
00:00:55,980 --> 00:00:58,915
I do not understand what it is
exactly that you would like to see

15
00:00:58,915 --> 00:00:59,881
on their desktops.

16
00:00:59,881 --> 00:01:02,904
You can take screenshots if
you want of certain things.

17
00:01:02,904 --> 00:01:04,278
If you need passwords,

18
00:01:04,278 --> 00:01:07,724
you can use keyloggers which
are embedded in Meterpreter.

19
00:01:07,724 --> 00:01:12,260
You just need to issue a command
to log keystrokes, I don't know,

20
00:01:12,260 --> 00:01:17,130
stuff of a kind, but I really don't
see the point of a remote desktop.

21
00:01:17,130 --> 00:01:19,390
If you want to see if they're
browsing something on the net and

22
00:01:19,390 --> 00:01:22,900
if they're watching something on the net,
you can obviously see the addresses,

23
00:01:22,900 --> 00:01:26,488
you can see the IP addresses of
what they're visiting on the net.

24
00:01:26,488 --> 00:01:29,682
Not the IP addresses but
you can also see the domains and

25
00:01:29,682 --> 00:01:32,669
then you can just copy them
into your own browser and

26
00:01:32,669 --> 00:01:36,090
have a look at whatever you want
to see almost in real time.

27
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:40,944
I know that would be a bit of a drag, but
believe me, it saves up on bandwidth,

28
00:01:40,944 --> 00:01:45,427
and if you do a remote desktop over
the net, you are very likely to render

29
00:01:45,427 --> 00:01:50,150
the other person's web browsing
experience practically inoperable.

30
00:01:50,150 --> 00:01:52,150
They won't be able to browse the web,
I mean, they will, but

31
00:01:52,150 --> 00:01:56,667
it will be very slow unless they
have a really good connection.

32
00:01:56,667 --> 00:02:00,348
And unless you have a really good
connection, you won't be able to do that.

33
00:02:00,348 --> 00:02:03,100
Try running TeamViewer and
you will see that it's not

34
00:02:03,100 --> 00:02:06,750
the fastest of applications out there,
not because of the way it was built,

35
00:02:06,750 --> 00:02:11,030
but because of the amount of information
that is passing in between two points.

36
00:02:12,030 --> 00:02:18,137
Anyway, you should have pretty much the
same setup as from the previous tutorial.

37
00:02:18,137 --> 00:02:21,100
You should not have closed anything,
I sincerely hope that you didn't.

38
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:23,978
It doesn't matter, if you did,
you can just repeat it.

39
00:02:23,978 --> 00:02:27,411
Here, we're gonna go ahead and

40
00:02:27,411 --> 00:02:32,379
open up our shell, so
just do the same things.

41
00:02:32,379 --> 00:02:38,606
It's still running, I believe,
on my Windows 8.1 machine,

42
00:02:38,606 --> 00:02:43,265
and let's see,
will it actually work out here.

43
00:02:43,265 --> 00:02:48,765
Or, hold on.

44
00:02:48,765 --> 00:02:50,425
Oh, I already have it running.

45
00:02:50,425 --> 00:02:54,350
So it's working, and
let me show you how is it working.

46
00:02:55,550 --> 00:02:58,664
I'm going to go over these commands
with you, don't worry about it.

47
00:02:58,664 --> 00:03:02,024
I just want to get into Meterpreter now,
excellent.

48
00:03:02,024 --> 00:03:03,261
So we are now in the Meterpreter.

49
00:03:03,261 --> 00:03:06,998
Let me just prove to you that I
am in fact a Windows machine.

50
00:03:06,998 --> 00:03:07,975
So cd.

51
00:03:12,547 --> 00:03:17,444
There we go,
these are obviously Windows files, cygwin.

52
00:03:17,444 --> 00:03:19,940
I even have that installed
on my Windows machine.

53
00:03:19,940 --> 00:03:20,640
Amazing.

54
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:21,840
Doesn't really matter.

55
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,380
Anyway, now you can see that
I am in my Windows machine.

56
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:26,900
I've just closed the Meterpreter.

57
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,250
I've actually placed my
Meterpreter shell into background.

58
00:03:30,250 --> 00:03:37,010
And that is something that you can do and
that you will be forced to do during

59
00:03:37,010 --> 00:03:42,380
certain hacks, primarily because you will
want to do other things with that session.

60
00:03:42,380 --> 00:03:44,013
You will want to open up a session and

61
00:03:44,013 --> 00:03:46,687
then you will want to do
different things to that session.

62
00:03:46,687 --> 00:03:50,490
You want to pass that session to different
exploits so they can use it as well.

63
00:03:50,490 --> 00:03:52,670
And you obviously can't do that like this.

64
00:03:52,670 --> 00:03:54,350
Now, what you would do is
put it in the background.

65
00:03:54,350 --> 00:03:56,640
But before we do,
just go ahead and type in help.

66
00:03:56,640 --> 00:03:59,304
This is going to give
you a list of commands.

67
00:03:59,304 --> 00:04:02,720
This is a very nice command, getsystem.

68
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:04,760
Attempts to elevate your privileges.

69
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:06,950
But this doesn't really always work.

70
00:04:06,950 --> 00:04:08,820
And here you have webcam commands.

71
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:14,006
I can't do this demonstration
on a virtual machine.

72
00:04:14,006 --> 00:04:17,850
But this is only for physical machines,

73
00:04:17,850 --> 00:04:22,717
unless you have a USB camera or
something of a kind.

74
00:04:22,717 --> 00:04:23,777
It's not really that hard.

75
00:04:23,777 --> 00:04:27,434
You just type in run and
then one of these commands.

76
00:04:27,434 --> 00:04:30,574
You will see later on,
we will do something.

77
00:04:30,574 --> 00:04:35,540
We will use some of the commands, not for
webcam, but we will some other commands.

78
00:04:35,540 --> 00:04:38,795
I do believe that it is just run and
then this and

79
00:04:38,795 --> 00:04:44,484
the rest will simply fall onto the system,
the system will be able to do the rest.

80
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:50,012
Anyway, so you have these things,
you can take screenshots,

81
00:04:50,012 --> 00:04:55,974
you can start capturing keystrokes,
stop capturing keystrokes.

82
00:04:55,974 --> 00:04:58,985
I don't know,
you can do pretty much whatever you want,

83
00:04:58,985 --> 00:05:03,407
you can list accessible desktop and
Windows stations, well, that's very nice.

84
00:05:03,407 --> 00:05:05,022
System information,

85
00:05:05,022 --> 00:05:09,954
this will list information on
the current system, so not a bad idea.

86
00:05:09,954 --> 00:05:14,561
Shell, we have already used shell,
drop into the system command shell,

87
00:05:14,561 --> 00:05:17,014
which means you get the CMD in Windows,

88
00:05:17,014 --> 00:05:21,947
practically, a CMD prompt in Windows,
although the tab does not work there.

89
00:05:21,947 --> 00:05:25,873
I'm not sure if reboot would work,
I think I've tried it before,

90
00:05:25,873 --> 00:05:27,494
but it gave me some errors.

91
00:05:27,494 --> 00:05:33,131
You will need to use shutdown space /r
command in order to reboot the system.

92
00:05:33,131 --> 00:05:36,171
ps will list the running processes.

93
00:05:36,171 --> 00:05:38,356
And up here, where is it, so

94
00:05:38,356 --> 00:05:43,650
I would suggest just taking
a look at all of these commands.

95
00:05:43,650 --> 00:05:47,340
The text for them is not that long, just
go ahead and read through all of them,

96
00:05:47,340 --> 00:05:48,960
if you can, go through all of them,

97
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,210
at least go through a few more
than we will use in this tutorial.

98
00:05:53,210 --> 00:05:57,430
Just to get an idea of what
this thing can actually do.

99
00:05:57,430 --> 00:06:01,958
Here, you can type in netstat and
it displays network connections,

100
00:06:01,958 --> 00:06:05,637
so you can see what they
are doing on the net in real time.

101
00:06:05,637 --> 00:06:06,470
Which is very nice.

102
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:13,100
As you can copy that, as you can pretty
much copy those addresses on to your

103
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:16,363
machine and you can see which sites are
they visiting or what they're doing there.

104
00:06:17,690 --> 00:06:21,612
As opposed to having,
as opposed to running a remote desktop,

105
00:06:21,612 --> 00:06:23,547
which is highly inefficient.

106
00:06:23,547 --> 00:06:26,470
Here you have some simple
file system commands,

107
00:06:26,470 --> 00:06:30,260
I'm pretty sure that some of
them won't work, but most will.

108
00:06:32,070 --> 00:06:35,030
And up here is the background,
which we have started.

109
00:06:35,030 --> 00:06:38,470
So, if you type in background,
it backgrounds the current session.

110
00:06:39,540 --> 00:06:41,070
Let's just go ahead and do that.

111
00:06:43,290 --> 00:06:46,030
Please, I cannot stress how important

112
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:47,960
it is that you take a look
at some of these commands.

113
00:06:47,960 --> 00:06:49,381
They are very simple to understand.

114
00:06:49,381 --> 00:06:53,830
You won't need to bash your head against
the wall to figure out what they do.

115
00:06:55,040 --> 00:07:00,685
You just take a look at them and
type them in, so for example,

116
00:07:00,685 --> 00:07:05,467
to background a session,
you type in background.

117
00:07:05,467 --> 00:07:06,724
It's the same principle.

118
00:07:06,724 --> 00:07:09,950
I don't think that you actually need
to use run, that was my bad here.

119
00:07:09,950 --> 00:07:12,220
But just rather instead type in a command.

120
00:07:12,220 --> 00:07:16,465
Before I type in background,
I'm gonna type in getsystem.

121
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:18,760
And this is gonna fail.

122
00:07:18,760 --> 00:07:19,517
I have a bad idea.

123
00:07:19,517 --> 00:07:20,394
Yep, there we go.

124
00:07:20,394 --> 00:07:21,210
Operation failed.

125
00:07:21,210 --> 00:07:23,220
The environment is incorrect.

126
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:26,000
For shell command, you just type in shell.

127
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:31,900
And it puts you into a CMD,
it gives you the command prompt.

128
00:07:31,900 --> 00:07:34,770
And let's see,
do we have any elevated privileges?

129
00:07:34,770 --> 00:07:39,322
Even though the getsystem command
did not work out to the best, but

130
00:07:39,322 --> 00:07:43,804
there was still a better way to
check this, just to know for sure.

131
00:07:43,804 --> 00:07:45,684
Because these things tend to bug out.

132
00:07:45,684 --> 00:07:49,481
I mean, this is a reverse shell,
so don't expect perfection.

133
00:07:49,481 --> 00:07:53,670
cd into Windows.

134
00:07:53,670 --> 00:07:54,504
Tab doesn't work here.

135
00:07:54,504 --> 00:07:57,741
See, if I press Tab,
it just keeps on jumping.

136
00:07:57,741 --> 00:08:00,678
System32.

137
00:08:00,678 --> 00:08:05,935
And, nope, cd Windows/System32,

138
00:08:05,935 --> 00:08:10,580
am I right now, okay, there we go.

139
00:08:12,190 --> 00:08:17,506
Now we're gonna try to make a directory
here, so mkdir test, does this work?

140
00:08:17,506 --> 00:08:18,706
Uh-uh, nope.

141
00:08:18,706 --> 00:08:23,110
mkdir test, Access is denied, I cannot
make a directory here, so proof enough.

142
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:27,677
Anyway, we're gonna now background.

143
00:08:27,677 --> 00:08:29,500
And tab does work here
to finish your commands.

144
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:36,570
Backgrounding session 5, and
you see it exits out of the Meterpreter.

145
00:08:36,570 --> 00:08:39,320
It doesn't exit out of Meterpreter,
but it puts into the background.

146
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:44,727
And in your foreground is your msfconsole.

147
00:08:44,727 --> 00:08:51,377
Now, you can type in sessions dash help to
get a list of help commands for sessions.

148
00:08:51,377 --> 00:08:55,720
You can also type in session -l to
get a list of running sessions.

149
00:08:55,720 --> 00:08:58,222
You can have pretty much
as many as you want here,

150
00:08:58,222 --> 00:09:00,007
as many as your system can handle.

151
00:09:00,007 --> 00:09:04,638
To get back into a session, type in -i and
type in the number of the session, the ID,

152
00:09:04,638 --> 00:09:06,347
press Enter, and there we go.

153
00:09:06,347 --> 00:09:09,764
We are once again into
the Meterpreter session number five.

154
00:09:09,764 --> 00:09:12,075
You can again type in background and

155
00:09:12,075 --> 00:09:15,244
put it in the background,
remain where you are.

156
00:09:15,244 --> 00:09:19,210
And the msfconsole from where
you can do various things.

157
00:09:19,210 --> 00:09:22,671
Now, I have decided to use this one,
and you see,

158
00:09:22,671 --> 00:09:26,770
I've described it here,
ask for privileges.

159
00:09:26,770 --> 00:09:31,020
Now, there are numerous ways
that you can attain elevated

160
00:09:31,020 --> 00:09:35,810
privileges on a remote system
upon opening a Meterpreter shelf.

161
00:09:35,810 --> 00:09:39,012
The best one in my personal experience
is to simply ask the user for

162
00:09:39,012 --> 00:09:43,230
the permissions.

163
00:09:43,230 --> 00:09:45,890
If they don't give them to you
the first time around, I don't know.

164
00:09:45,890 --> 00:09:47,750
Wait a while and then ask them again.

165
00:09:49,140 --> 00:09:50,800
And if that doesn't work, I don't know.

166
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,410
Wait a while, ask them again.

167
00:09:52,410 --> 00:09:56,814
Eventually, they will click,
more often than not, yes.

168
00:09:56,814 --> 00:10:00,571
I don't know why, but
such are the things in Windows.

169
00:10:00,571 --> 00:10:02,070
You don't need a password.

170
00:10:02,070 --> 00:10:03,280
You can just click Yes or No and

171
00:10:03,280 --> 00:10:07,100
you have admin privileges, which is
fascinating to me, to say the least.

172
00:10:09,280 --> 00:10:14,720
Anyway, before I use that exploit,

173
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,282
I'm gonna type in use post, so

174
00:10:19,282 --> 00:10:24,030
post exploitation, windows.

175
00:10:24,030 --> 00:10:28,060
Yes, display all 149.

176
00:10:28,060 --> 00:10:31,961
And anyway, you got here escalation, so

177
00:10:31,961 --> 00:10:36,650
you can gather credentials,
different types.

178
00:10:36,650 --> 00:10:41,118
But, okay, so
you can even have a keylogger here, but

179
00:10:41,118 --> 00:10:43,362
you don't really need it.

180
00:10:43,362 --> 00:10:44,742
If you have an Meterpreter session,

181
00:10:44,742 --> 00:10:47,019
you can start it from
the Meterpreter session immediately.

182
00:10:47,019 --> 00:10:48,756
Rather, instead, I want escalate.

183
00:10:48,756 --> 00:10:52,817
So, there's more if you just
wanna take a look down there,

184
00:10:52,817 --> 00:10:55,104
it's like 149 things there.

185
00:10:55,104 --> 00:10:59,324
So use escalate.

186
00:10:59,324 --> 00:11:00,404
Press tab.

187
00:11:00,404 --> 00:11:01,001
Excellent.

188
00:11:01,001 --> 00:11:05,393
So we got, like, drop link, getsystem,

189
00:11:05,393 --> 00:11:10,647
golden_ticket, screen_unlock, kbdlayout.

190
00:11:10,647 --> 00:11:11,250
Actually, I don't know what this one is.

191
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:15,477
Anyway, you can use getsystem as well.

192
00:11:15,477 --> 00:11:18,963
That one is being used by your
Meterpreter if I'm not mistaken, but

193
00:11:18,963 --> 00:11:21,030
that doesn't always work.

194
00:11:21,030 --> 00:11:23,328
That's why I said it's
the best thing you can do.

195
00:11:23,328 --> 00:11:26,896
I just wanted to show you some other
ways of escalating privileges, so

196
00:11:26,896 --> 00:11:30,763
you can pretty much use any one of these
in pretty much the same way as I am going

197
00:11:30,763 --> 00:11:31,624
to use this one.

198
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:34,041
There is little or no difference.

199
00:11:34,041 --> 00:11:36,278
If you get stuck somewhere,
feel free to ask.

200
00:11:36,278 --> 00:11:37,818
So use exploit/windows/local.

201
00:11:49,562 --> 00:11:51,039
And what do we got here?

202
00:11:51,039 --> 00:11:53,213
Still too many.

203
00:11:53,213 --> 00:11:55,513
ask.

204
00:11:55,513 --> 00:12:00,477
Excellent, so
now we have entered this exploit,

205
00:12:00,477 --> 00:12:05,334
and for this exploit,
you type in show options.

206
00:12:05,334 --> 00:12:08,143
And I have configured this to session one,

207
00:12:08,143 --> 00:12:13,070
as that is what is was previously,
you only need to configure session one.

208
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,706
Payload options, that's already
configured, so you see, it's using

209
00:12:17,706 --> 00:12:22,260
Windows Meterpreter reverse_tcp,
the one that we have used previously.

210
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:24,650
What you need to do is
just change the session.

211
00:12:24,650 --> 00:12:26,330
You won't immediately get this, I think.

212
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:27,390
You need to set the session.

213
00:12:27,390 --> 00:12:29,200
This is from my previous session.

214
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:35,577
So just type in set session 5.

215
00:12:35,577 --> 00:12:41,837
Excellent, so show options.

216
00:12:41,837 --> 00:12:46,430
Excellent, so it's session five, and
these things are loaded accordingly.

217
00:12:46,430 --> 00:12:51,230
Yes, they are the same, but I was just
doing some testing before this, and

218
00:12:52,350 --> 00:12:56,880
just testing out will it actually work or
not, and how it would actually work,

219
00:12:56,880 --> 00:12:59,670
how it would look like,
just to bring you guys quality content.

220
00:13:00,930 --> 00:13:04,300
Anyway, now that we have this done,

221
00:13:04,300 --> 00:13:09,976
you just type in exploit, and
it's gonna transmit a signal.

222
00:13:09,976 --> 00:13:14,016
[SOUND] There you go,
not sure if you heard that.

223
00:13:14,016 --> 00:13:18,380
If we open up our Windows machine,
you see User Account Control.

224
00:13:18,380 --> 00:13:23,367
So you're basically asking the user for
the control.

225
00:13:23,367 --> 00:13:27,184
If you want it, sure, type it, Yes or No.

226
00:13:27,184 --> 00:13:31,504
But even people sometimes by
mistake will click Yes, and

227
00:13:31,504 --> 00:13:36,101
then they'll be too lazy to reverse it or
anything of a kind.

228
00:13:36,101 --> 00:13:38,781
That's just one of the ways, but
there are others, as I have showed you.

229
00:13:38,781 --> 00:13:41,990
You can use them in pretty
much exactly the same way.

230
00:13:41,990 --> 00:13:44,570
Now it says Meterpreter session 6 opened,

231
00:13:44,570 --> 00:13:48,970
it has opened up a new session, and
this Meterpreter has elevated privileges.

232
00:13:48,970 --> 00:13:53,997
Let's see if that is true,

233
00:13:53,997 --> 00:14:00,125
getsystem, what, get me help.

234
00:14:00,125 --> 00:14:01,842
Yes, of course.

235
00:14:01,842 --> 00:14:03,602
Exit.

236
00:14:03,602 --> 00:14:06,522
Get.

237
00:14:06,522 --> 00:14:11,619
Okay, got system via technique 1,
it does actually work, no problems.

238
00:14:11,619 --> 00:14:19,061
And now we can do shell, and see, can we
actually make a file in Windows\System32?

239
00:14:19,061 --> 00:14:23,650
Apparently, we should be able,
so mkdir test.

240
00:14:23,650 --> 00:14:24,717
Test has been created.

241
00:14:24,717 --> 00:14:27,417
A subdirectory or
file test already exists.

242
00:14:27,417 --> 00:14:29,914
Okay, fine.

243
00:14:29,914 --> 00:14:33,240
mkdir test1.

244
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:36,117
So it does actually manage to make it.

245
00:14:36,117 --> 00:14:40,114
So if I type in del test.

246
00:14:40,114 --> 00:14:41,460
Are you sure you want to?

247
00:14:41,460 --> 00:14:42,510
Yes, I'm sure.

248
00:14:42,510 --> 00:14:45,877
del test1.

249
00:14:45,877 --> 00:14:47,057
Sure you want to do that?

250
00:14:47,057 --> 00:14:49,898
Yes.
So we can manipulate files in System32,

251
00:14:49,898 --> 00:14:52,591
which means we have
pretty much full control.

252
00:14:52,591 --> 00:14:56,527
If we can place files and
run them from there,

253
00:14:56,527 --> 00:15:00,894
we are omnipotent,
pretty much, on the system.

254
00:15:00,894 --> 00:15:06,257
Anyway, let's go ahead and exit this,

255
00:15:06,257 --> 00:15:11,632
clear the, not exit, but background.

256
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:14,390
Clear the screen.

257
00:15:14,390 --> 00:15:17,986
Anyway, that was one of
the processes which we could've used

258
00:15:17,986 --> 00:15:22,413
to elevate privileges, but there
are other ones that I've showed you, and

259
00:15:22,413 --> 00:15:26,107
you can use them pretty much the same
way as I have used this one.

260
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:30,507
You just pass the session ID and
then just, if there are some other

261
00:15:30,507 --> 00:15:35,147
parameters that are required,
just type in show options like this.

262
00:15:35,147 --> 00:15:38,090
show options.

263
00:15:38,090 --> 00:15:41,342
And it tells you here,
is something required or not?

264
00:15:41,342 --> 00:15:46,562
So it says SESSION 5 is required,
TECHNIQUE EXE.

265
00:15:46,562 --> 00:15:52,590
And this should be configured by default,
but you only need to have a session here.

266
00:15:52,590 --> 00:15:54,890
So you can see what fields
are required and not.

267
00:15:54,890 --> 00:16:00,880
You basically just type in set and type
in the name of whatever you wish to set.

268
00:16:00,880 --> 00:16:01,460
That's it.

269
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:03,970
No problems there.

270
00:16:03,970 --> 00:16:09,867
However, again, if you encounter problems
doing some other stuff in Metasploit,

271
00:16:09,867 --> 00:16:14,684
please do not hesitate to post it
in the discussion section on Udemy,

272
00:16:14,684 --> 00:16:18,437
and I'll be more than happy
to attempt to assist you.

273
00:16:18,437 --> 00:16:22,790
In any case, I bid you farewell
until the next tutorial,

274
00:16:22,790 --> 00:16:27,870
where we will actually do,
where we will make a persistent shell,

275
00:16:27,870 --> 00:16:33,794
so every time a machine resets, we will
gain an open reverse shell over here.

276
00:16:33,794 --> 00:16:34,895
Anyway, until then.
