1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everybody and welcome to this follow-up tutorial.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:09,000
Today I will show you how to actually install tor itself.

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:11,500
We'll go through the installation procedure

4
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:17,900
and in order for us to do that, we will need to use the new user that we have created -- test

5
00:00:17,900 --> 00:00:21,300
That's the user name off the new user.

6
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,600
Anyway, in order for you to do that, you need to log out

7
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:27,100
and in order for you to log out of Kali Linux

8
00:00:27,100 --> 00:00:31,050
just go ahead and click in the upper right corner, where it says root.

9
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,500
Go scroll down to "switch user"

10
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:35,900
and yep, there we go.

11
00:00:35,900 --> 00:00:38,100
The screen is going to resize a bit, perhaps.

12
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:39,100
Excellent

13
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:40,700
So it says here "test"

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,200
I'm already logged in a test because I have done this previously

15
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:46,600
but it's gonna prompt me for a password as well

16
00:00:46,600 --> 00:00:49,100
but the user test is running in the background

17
00:00:49,100 --> 00:00:51,890
So just go ahead and type in the password for it

18
00:00:51,890 --> 00:00:52,600
Press ENTER

19
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:54,300
Very simple

20
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:56,500
You will follow exactly the same procedure.

21
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:58,500
There is nothing different that I'm doing

22
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:02,600
that perhaps you need to change or alter or anything of a kind.

23
00:01:02,600 --> 00:01:05,300
There is a browser icon in the upper left corner.

24
00:01:05,300 --> 00:01:06,200
It's blue

25
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,900
It's the iceweasel browser.

26
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,080
Go ahead and press on it.

27
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,280
Use your favorite search engine, type in tor, press Enter

28
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:15,700
and go ahead and open the first site that pops up.

29
00:01:15,700 --> 00:01:19,300
It's Tor Project: Anonymity Online

30
00:01:19,300 --> 00:01:25,000
Absolutely make sure that you are downloading this browser from a proper site.

31
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,500
From the official sources.

32
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:28,500
So it says HTTPS

33
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,900
Make sure there is an S marcation at the end

34
00:01:31,900 --> 00:01:35,800
that's not HTTP, rather HTTPS

35
00:01:35,800 --> 00:01:37,800
and make sure that the domain is correct.

36
00:01:37,800 --> 00:01:40,000
So https://wwwtorproject.org/

37
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,500
It's not dot com, it's not dot some country extension, it's not dot anything else

38
00:01:45,500 --> 00:01:47,500
it's dot org

39
00:01:47,500 --> 00:01:53,500
Anyway, go ahead and click straight away on "download tor"

40
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:57,700
and I need a 64 tor browser GNU/Linux

41
00:01:57,700 --> 00:01:59,200
That is what I want to download

42
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,469
but in case you're using some other operating system

43
00:02:02,469 --> 00:02:18,400
over here you have Microsoft Windows, Apple OS X

44
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,200
We are currently going to go ahead and use the Linux/UNIX version

45
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:26,400
and there are some additions in all downloads section as well.

46
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,100
Feel free to check that out.

47
00:02:28,100 --> 00:02:32,200
Perhaps go ahead about the site and see what you can find

48
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:33,500
There are some interesting things here

49
00:02:33,500 --> 00:02:40,700
Forums, FAQ, and some other things as well.

50
00:02:40,700 --> 00:02:43,900
I would strongly advise you to actually just browse around the site a bit.

51
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:47,500
For the time being, I'm just gonna go ahead and on Download.

52
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,500
Yes, I wish save file.

53
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,000
Okay, the download will proceed

54
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:53,000
and it only takes about a minute.

55
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:55,700
The downloads are a very short amount of time

56
00:02:55,700 --> 00:03:00,200
that I will use to actually tell you what tor is.

57
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:07,600
Now basically what you do with tor is simply route your traffic to go through certain points

58
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:11,600
and every time it hops, there is an encryption layer

59
00:03:11,600 --> 00:03:13,700
It make your connection very secure

60
00:03:13,700 --> 00:03:18,700
and there are these things that are called the internodes.

61
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:22,200
Nodes are basically computers or servers through which you go

62
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:26,500
so you make a request to a certain website

63
00:03:26,500 --> 00:03:30,900
and then your connection goes from your computer to some other computer

64
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,500
and then from that computer to some other, and so on and so forth

65
00:03:33,500 --> 00:03:35,900
until it reaches the exit node.

66
00:03:35,900 --> 00:03:39,800
All of these devices are a part of the tor network

67
00:03:39,800 --> 00:03:41,900
and once it reaches the exit node

68
00:03:41,900 --> 00:03:47,300
it is the exit know that actually makes the request towards the site that you wanted.

69
00:03:47,300 --> 00:03:51,000
Basically you are using a lot of proxies.

70
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,810
That would be the very basic explanation, but there is a lot more to it.

71
00:03:55,810 --> 00:03:59,100
The encryption being the major part of it.

72
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:05,300
So there are multiple layers of encryption there, and it's not that that easy to figure out

73
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:09,600
or should I say it is rather impossible to figure out where the connection is coming from

74
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:12,300
if you are a system administrator

75
00:04:12,300 --> 00:04:15,400
unless you are controlling these nodes or something like that

76
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:17,539
which is highly unlikely.

77
00:04:17,539 --> 00:04:20,600
Basically this is a fantastic way of staying anonymous

78
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,100
but you do not need to necessarily use tor as a tor browser

79
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:26,200
just to go and access the hidden web.

80
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:31,500
Rather instead, you can use tor to actually torify...

81
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:34,200
That is the term, I am not making an error here

82
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,500
That is the term to torify your applications

83
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:39,500
and once you have torified them

84
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:44,700
all traffic generated by those applications will be routed through the tor network

85
00:04:44,700 --> 00:04:46,970
and you will be anonymous to a very large extent.

86
00:04:46,970 --> 00:04:52,200
Although keep in mind that all things using tor are very slow

87
00:04:52,200 --> 00:04:55,599
primarily because your connection is being routed through a lot of devices

88
00:04:55,599 --> 00:05:00,009
and there are a lot of people out there that are using those devices.

89
00:05:00,009 --> 00:05:01,700
Anybody can contribute, really.

90
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:05,900
You can see a bit more on the website, and so on and so forth

91
00:05:05,900 --> 00:05:09,000
if you have any interest in such things

92
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:11,500
but for the time being, I'm just gonna go ahead and skip that .

93
00:05:11,500 --> 00:05:16,000
Rather instead ,I want to start using tor and show you the dark web.

94
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:19,500
So just go ahead and click on your download.

95
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:22,500
Just give it a moment of time.

96
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:24,620
It says "Reading archive. Please wait"

97
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:25,700
Excellent

98
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:30,000
I want to extracted it to test desktop.

99
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,020
So go ahead and proceed.

100
00:05:32,020 --> 00:05:34,600
Let's see if it's gonna succeed.

101
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:37,000
Extracting files from archive

102
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:39,400
Don't cancel it, just quit it.

103
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:40,400
Excellent

104
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:42,700
So just go ahead and open up this folder.

105
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:48,000
In the browser folder section, you have a lot of these things

106
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:49,300
if you want to check them out

107
00:05:49,300 --> 00:05:52,949
but for the time being, what you need is "Start tor browser"

108
00:05:52,949 --> 00:05:58,000
These are just the files that the tor browser uses, so no worries there.

109
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
Anyway just go ahead and click on "Start tor browser", run

110
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:05,100
and this process may take awhile.

111
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,400
It's shorter for me, but it might take a bit longer for you.

112
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,000
I don't know, it just depends I suppose on many things.

113
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:11,900
Don't worry about it.

114
00:06:11,900 --> 00:06:16,600
It's gonna take up to minute, maximum, to connect to the tor network.

115
00:06:16,600 --> 00:06:19,200
Anyway, just go ahead and expand it.

116
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:24,100
Now you might ask yourselves "Well, what is so special about the tor browser?"

117
00:06:24,100 --> 00:06:25,500
It's like a regular browser.

118
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,000
Maybe it loads a different website as the default, but that's it.

119
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,000
Nothing really special there.

120
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:35,700
However, it gives you the ability to actually access the .onion domains

121
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:37,100
and here's how we do that --

122
00:06:37,100 --> 00:06:43,000
The first thing that I'm going to do is type in "hiddenwiki"

123
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,400
It's one of those websites where you have a link to a large amount of other .onion domains

124
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,500
to those of significance anyway

125
00:06:52,500 --> 00:06:57,200
and its URL changes continuously.

126
00:06:57,200 --> 00:07:02,500
That is why I am actually searching for in the video, as opposed to just pre-loading it

127
00:07:02,500 --> 00:07:04,800
primarily to show you how you can find

128
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:05,800
It not really that difficult

129
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:10,600
you can just type it in to the search engine and it's fairly simple.

130
00:07:10,600 --> 00:07:12,700
There are no difficulties

131
00:07:12,700 --> 00:07:17,000
So just go ahead and open up a couple of these websites.

132
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,000
You will get one of them to work for sure

133
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,600
So these are .onion domains.

134
00:07:24,600 --> 00:07:25,600
A list of them

135
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:32,000
Quite a large list, but I'm not actually interested in those.

136
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,700
So the hidden wiki has been hacked.

137
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:38,500
This is the new URL

138
00:07:38,500 --> 00:07:42,000
Don't worry about this, this happens like all the time.

139
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,700
So it's just one of those things that you have to learn to live with.

140
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:52,000
I know it's a bit inconvenient to have to search URL all the time

141
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,200
but if you want to the dark web

142
00:07:55,200 --> 00:08:01,300
things are not as stable as they are on the on the regular web

143
00:08:01,300 --> 00:08:05,900
so that can be problematic to the point of extreme

144
00:08:05,900 --> 00:08:08,000
So it says "Welcome to The Hidden Wiki"

145
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:13,500
"New hidden wiki url 2015. Add it to bookmarks and spread it!!"

146
00:08:13,500 --> 00:08:14,200
Excellent

147
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:15,500
So this is where we want to be.

148
00:08:15,500 --> 00:08:17,800
Let me just explain where we are

149
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:22,900
This is a rather large list of links for .onion domains, as I said

150
00:08:22,900 --> 00:08:25,200
and you have a lot of things here.

151
00:08:25,200 --> 00:08:28,700
Some of them are illegal and we will not go into those.

152
00:08:28,700 --> 00:08:33,500
Basically where you have people who are selling PayPal accounts, credit card accounts

153
00:08:33,500 --> 00:08:36,700
credit card numbers, and so on and so forth.

154
00:08:36,700 --> 00:08:40,000
Those are really not the places where we should go.

155
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,900
Perhaps if you want to check out if your PayPal has been hacked or something like that.

156
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,400
If it has, you can go onto those websites and search for it

157
00:08:46,400 --> 00:08:48,800
to see if it's actually there

158
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:54,000
and other than that, I really see no other reason why you should visit them.

159
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,500
Okay, so we have some editor's picks

160
00:08:57,500 --> 00:09:00,339
If you want to volunteer or something like that

161
00:09:00,339 --> 00:09:02,200
Introduction points

162
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:04,180
We don't really need any of those things.

163
00:09:04,180 --> 00:09:05,500
Financial services

164
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:07,900
So you have a ton load of things here.

165
00:09:07,900 --> 00:09:12,100
A lot of things concern the anonymity of payment online.

166
00:09:12,100 --> 00:09:15,600
So Bitcoin or you can buy prepaid cards

167
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:17,000
or something like that.

168
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:19,900
If you buy prepaid card, I suppose it's okay

169
00:09:19,900 --> 00:09:23,310
because, you know, you can get a prepaid card at Walmart or something like that.

170
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:25,000
They give them out practically

171
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:28,600
They're gift cards, or something like that, that you can use for online payments

172
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:30,600
so you are completely anonymous with those

173
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:36,000
but never ever buy a genuine credit card because that's illegal.

174
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,700
There are no cases where it is legal

175
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,000
I thought it might be when the person actually owns it, but no, not really.

176
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:50,500
Anyway, down below, you have commercial services where you can find all sorts of cheap things

177
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:53,500
I  wouldn't really recommend buying anything from here

178
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,200
to be shipped to your address

179
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:02,200
primarily because you have no guarantee whatsoever that that is what you  have ordered

180
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:04,900
or that you'll get the genuine stuff.

181
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:07,400
Here we have Anonymity & Security

182
00:10:07,400 --> 00:10:13,200
There are some things concerning good proxies, concerning the tor.

183
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:16,200
You might wanna check these four out.

184
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:17,900
So that's not a bad idea there.

185
00:10:17,900 --> 00:10:22,200
These are all external resources that I'm showing you now that you can use on the hidden web.

186
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:27,200
That is the primary purpose of why I am showing you how to access to hidden web.

187
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:34,600
So you can use a large amount of these external resources during your pen testing exercises.

188
00:10:34,600 --> 00:10:36,800
There are lots of useful things here

189
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,700
and I definitely encourage you to go over some of them

190
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:44,200
and see if you can find something of use to you.

191
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,500
What we are today mainly interested in are the forums.

192
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,000
So you have Forums/Boards/Chans and so on and so forth

193
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,100
and there are a lot of things here, so let's just open some of them.

194
00:10:55,100 --> 00:11:00,600
Keep in mind that they tend to be down, that the URLs tend to change

195
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:02,400
and it can be problematic.

196
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:05,000
So let's just try BlackBook

197
00:11:05,000 --> 00:11:07,100
Maybe something's gonna be there.

198
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,700
HackForum

199
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,500
Yep, you see there is a problem loading this page.

200
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:14,600
This is not gonna open

201
00:11:14,600 --> 00:11:16,300
This one might

202
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:18,500
The Secret Story Archive

203
00:11:18,500 --> 00:11:19,700
No I don't need that

204
00:11:19,700 --> 00:11:21,400
Deep Web Radio

205
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:26,700
Hack the Planet -- Let's see what they got there.

206
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:27,900
The Intel Exchange

207
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:28,600
Excellent

208
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:32,000
Intel Exchange -- I think this is one of the better ones.

209
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:37,200
So you can just go ahead and go through these pages

210
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:39,000
and see if you can find anything of use.

211
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:40,600
We are in IntelExchange

212
00:11:40,600 --> 00:11:42,600
This is most likely not gonna open.

213
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:43,200
Excellent

214
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:45,600
So this is one of those forums where you will need to register

215
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,700
but I mean, nobody's asking for your credit card information.

216
00:11:48,700 --> 00:11:52,800
Just fill in the basic information, like your user names, passwords

217
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:55,569
how you wish to be addressed, and so on and so forth

218
00:11:55,569 --> 00:11:59,800
and then you then you have a lot of things here which can come in handy.

219
00:11:59,800 --> 00:12:02,200
So you have general discussions.

220
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:03,900
We don't really want that.

221
00:12:03,900 --> 00:12:07,900
This is what we were looking for -- Software

222
00:12:07,900 --> 00:12:11,600
So hacking, programming, tor, and everything else about software

223
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:14,200
Let's see what's there.

224
00:12:14,200 --> 00:12:17,000
By the way, whatever code you download from these websites

225
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:20,800
either run it within virtual environments or do not run it at all.

226
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:25,400
I'm just gonna go ahead and say that.

227
00:12:25,400 --> 00:12:31,800
Do not run it on your regular machines or on anybody's regular machines

228
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,500
because that's never a good idea.

229
00:12:35,500 --> 00:12:37,079
So what do we got here?

230
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:39,800
"Best Programming Language for Making an OS"

231
00:12:39,800 --> 00:12:45,300
Well God, we don't really need that. That can be rather complicated

232
00:12:45,300 --> 00:12:51,600
Down below --  "Is it safe to download pdfs on tor?"

233
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:57,600
You shouldn't do that. You shouldn't download anything on Tor that you will use on your regular machines.

234
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:01,900
We have some pretty stupid things here which we will never get to use

235
00:13:01,900 --> 00:13:05,500
but there are some very nice things.

236
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:07,700
We have IP address questions

237
00:13:07,700 --> 00:13:11,340
so what can we do with an IP address, and so on and so forth.

238
00:13:11,340 --> 00:13:13,400
I can't open any of these because I am not registered

239
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:16,000
but I have been in these forums and they can be quite useful

240
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:20,400
I don't think I've been on this one in particular, but I have been on forums in the dark net

241
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:23,500
and you can find some interesting things that people have done.

242
00:13:23,500 --> 00:13:24,800
Some interesting methods.

243
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:30,000
Usually things tend to come out here first and then they hit the general public

244
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:33,600
or the regular web, which ever way you want to see it

245
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:34,300
and there we go.

246
00:13:34,300 --> 00:13:36,200
We have keyloggers here.

247
00:13:36,200 --> 00:13:39,500
So you can find some information on keyloggers

248
00:13:39,500 --> 00:13:41,100
how to use them, where to find them

249
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:45,600
but I would suggest reading the reviews mainly here and the suggestions

250
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:47,890
and then figuring out where would you download it.

251
00:13:47,890 --> 00:13:50,700
Seeing if a keylogger is open source or close source.

252
00:13:50,700 --> 00:13:53,800
If it's open source, perhaps you can go to their website and downloaded from there

253
00:13:53,800 --> 00:13:55,500
and be safe in that manner.

254
00:13:55,500 --> 00:13:57,200
So that's not a bad idea

255
00:13:57,200 --> 00:13:59,900
and you have a ton load of other things you see --

256
00:13:59,900 --> 00:14:05,800
Hacking tools, SQL Injection, Operating Systems for hacking, and so on and so forth.

257
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:10,400
You have a ton load of information here, which I would strongly recommend that you use

258
00:14:10,400 --> 00:14:13,500
that you just go over it, see what people are doing there.

259
00:14:13,500 --> 00:14:15,900
Do not do anything illegal.

260
00:14:15,900 --> 00:14:18,200
Just go ahead and visit the forums

261
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:22,500
and see what sort of information can you extract from it, that's all.

262
00:14:22,500 --> 00:14:28,220
In any case, I will conclude the tutorial here.

263
00:14:28,220 --> 00:14:34,300
I hope you find the dark web to be a useful asset in your pen testing career

264
00:14:34,300 --> 00:14:37,300
or your pen testing activities in general.

265
00:14:37,300 --> 00:14:38,300
Believe me, it is

266
00:14:38,300 --> 00:14:41,500
You can find a lot of useful things, as I keep restating

267
00:14:41,500 --> 00:14:44,000
and the connections can be rather slow

268
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,800
and it is safe to install a tor browser on your regular machines

269
00:14:47,800 --> 00:14:54,200
as long as you download it from the official site, which is torproject.org

270
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,300
but under the protocol of HTTPS, and not HTTP

271
00:15:00,300 --> 00:15:05,150
In any case, I bid you farewell and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
