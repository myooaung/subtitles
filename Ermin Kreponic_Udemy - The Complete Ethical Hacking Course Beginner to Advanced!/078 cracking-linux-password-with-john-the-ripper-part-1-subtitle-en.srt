1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,200
Okay, so due to some reviews that I've gotten

2
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,600
I am NOT going to be drilling the "Hello everybody" sentence anymore

3
00:00:08,600 --> 00:00:11,400
or I will try not to do it anyway

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,200
but rather instead, I'm just gonna jump into the tutorial itself right away.

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:21,500
So today we're gonna do something different from what we've done thus far.

6
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:27,200
This is a common problem encountered by tech support people and companies

7
00:00:27,200 --> 00:00:29,650
or forensics and police

8
00:00:29,650 --> 00:00:30,600
or something of a kind

9
00:00:30,600 --> 00:00:33,800
or private companies as well.

10
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:36,400
You generally get a machine if you are working forensics

11
00:00:36,400 --> 00:00:39,000
but you're working for the police force

12
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:41,100
or whether you are working for a private company

13
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,000
that is a contractor for the police or something of a kind

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:51,800
you will inevitably encounter system passwords that you will need to bypass.

15
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,800
That can be extremely problematic.

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,000
For example, if somebody has encrypted their drives

17
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:00,800
with a strong enough encryption key

18
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:08,000
it is unlikely that you will ever manage to pull anything out of those drives.

19
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,200
Now we're not going to be dealing with the encrypted drives today

20
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:16,000
as that is pretty much impossible or highly unlikely, I would say.

21
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,500
Rather instead, we will be dealing with systems passwords.

22
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,400
Now usually what the forensics would do is insert a bootable CD or USB

23
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,700
and boot it from there.

24
00:01:27,700 --> 00:01:34,300
However, a lot of the systems you get logged in by some default user.

25
00:01:34,300 --> 00:01:36,800
For example, my default user here is test.

26
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:40,000
It doesn't have any root privileges whatsoever

27
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:45,600
but I am able to actually do some basic operations on the system

28
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:49,000
which do not require root access.

29
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,400
Now from this user mode, I want to acquire a root password

30
00:01:53,400 --> 00:01:57,000
so that I can actually control the system to the fullest of extent

31
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,000
and see what is going on there.

32
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,000
Now I can't actually control the system from a bootable CD

33
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:06,100
Rather instead, I can control that particular system

34
00:02:06,100 --> 00:02:09,600
which runs from a bootable CD and then access the files here

35
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:11,800
and this is also one of the methods it that is very nice.

36
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:15,300
You can extract password hashes and then crack them later on

37
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:17,000
or something of a kind

38
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:19,600
but today, what I wanted to show you

39
00:02:19,600 --> 00:02:23,900
this particular method is when people forget their passwords

40
00:02:23,900 --> 00:02:25,400
or something of a kind.

41
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:30,500
You don't necessarily want to go into through the trouble

42
00:02:30,500 --> 00:02:32,400
of actually booting from a CD

43
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:33,590
then getting a hash

44
00:02:33,590 --> 00:02:37,200
and then after you've gotten a hash, you then need to crack it

45
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:38,250
and so on and so forth.

46
00:02:38,250 --> 00:02:43,100
Rather instead, I will show you a method where you can obtain root access

47
00:02:43,100 --> 00:02:46,700
without that, by just rebooting the system and changing a few things there

48
00:02:46,700 --> 00:02:50,200
and then afterwards, we will use that method

49
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:54,200
or we will use the one with the CD to acquire the hash as well

50
00:02:54,200 --> 00:02:59,400
and then I will show you how to crack that hash with John the Ripper.

51
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,700
Anyway, without further ado, let's just go ahead and reboot the system.

52
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:05,800
So I'm just logged in as test here.

53
00:03:05,800 --> 00:03:08,300
Let's just type in "reboot"

54
00:03:08,300 --> 00:03:14,400
Oops...We can just use the graphical interface to reboot the system

55
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:23,000
or you can just physically turn the machine off and on.

56
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:26,400
As I said, you can physically turn the machine on and off

57
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:32,000
and that's gonna qualify as a as a restart.

58
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,500
So it is now in the process of booting, GRUB is loading

59
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:40,600
and immediately after the GRUB loads, move up and down

60
00:03:40,600 --> 00:03:43,300
so that the timer actually stops.

61
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:44,700
Go ahead and press...

62
00:03:44,700 --> 00:03:46,200
You see there are these options here

63
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,700
It says "Use up and down arrow keys to select which entry is highlighted"

64
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:57,000
"Press Enter to boot the selected OS or 'e' to edit those commands before booting"

65
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:04,000
So what we want to do is press 'e', and there's a whole bunch of things here.

66
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:05,300
It's kinda difficult to see.

67
00:04:05,300 --> 00:04:08,200
I can't make it any clearer for you unfortunately

68
00:04:08,200 --> 00:04:12,000
There is one line which is very clear

69
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:12,700
where I am now

70
00:04:12,700 --> 00:04:18,200
It says "echo loading Linux 3.18.0-kali1-amd64"

71
00:04:18,200 --> 00:04:19,300
I'm sure you see that one.

72
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:29,200
Down below immediately, there is "Linux /boot/vmlinuz-3.18.00..."

73
00:04:29,200 --> 00:04:35,700
and down below that line, you have this number stream...

74
00:04:35,700 --> 00:04:37,540
Well, it's the same line I think.

75
00:04:37,540 --> 00:04:41,000
Let me just move the arrow...

76
00:04:41,000 --> 00:04:41,800
Excellent! There we go

77
00:04:41,800 --> 00:04:43,860
So it's the same line basically

78
00:04:43,870 --> 00:04:45,800
It just can't fit into the screen.

79
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:47,900
Maybe on your computer it will .

80
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,200
So there is this long number

81
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,000
It says here "9517-a28..."

82
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:53,400
and so on and so forth

83
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:58,000
and after that line, immediately it says r o.

84
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,200
Due to the background, it's a little bit difficult to see

85
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:03,200
but on your systems you'll be able to see it with more clarity

86
00:05:03,200 --> 00:05:05,050
but anyway, after this number

87
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:07,200
"9517-a28..."

88
00:05:07,200 --> 00:05:10,530
There is a space, and then there is r o

89
00:05:10,530 --> 00:05:11,800
Delete the r o

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,500
Type in r w

91
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:16,600
Go to the end of that line

92
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:18,000
Don't change anything else

93
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Go to the end

94
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:20,300
Press space

95
00:05:20,300 --> 00:05:37,000
Type in "init=/bin/bash"

96
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:38,300
Excellent

97
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:53,000
So let's see how do we actually save this mode.

98
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:57,500
So I just pressed F10 and it's booting up now.

99
00:05:57,500 --> 00:05:58,900
Let's see what happens

100
00:05:58,900 --> 00:06:00,000
Excellent! There we go

101
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,400
So I am prompted with a root shell.

102
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,200
See I am root on my system now .

103
00:06:06,200 --> 00:06:11,400
You can see in the left corner of the screen that I am root here

104
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,300
Of course, this would be in full screen mode

105
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:15,830
but you can't actually load VirtualBox guest additions

106
00:06:15,830 --> 00:06:18,000
while you are booting it like this

107
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,500
so the screen will be rather small.

108
00:06:21,500 --> 00:06:24,900
Anyway, it says root@ (none)

109
00:06:24,900 --> 00:06:28,800
but doesn't really matter, I can do whatever I want.

110
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,600
I can go ahead and clear the screen

111
00:06:30,600 --> 00:06:34,000
I can /cd/root

112
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,000
See I have full access to the system

113
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:43,000
and from here, I can pretty much do anything.

114
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:50,000
For example, I can do "init 5" you have start nope you do not have startx

115
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,000
You "startx"

116
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:55,300
Nope, you do not have startx

117
00:06:55,300 --> 00:06:56,200
Fantastic

118
00:06:56,200 --> 00:06:58,200
ifconfig

119
00:06:58,200 --> 00:07:04,230
No network configuration either, primarily because I am in this mode

120
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:06,600
which is fantastic, but it doesn't matter.

121
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,200
I can do a lot of things with the system.

122
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:12,200
Just to give you an example

123
00:07:12,200 --> 00:07:12,840
Here you go

124
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:17,000
cd/home/test/

125
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:22,400
So I am in test, and now I can do "passwd test"

126
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:24,500
and I can change the password for test.

127
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:29,000
I can even do "passwd root" and I can change the password for root.

128
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:30,400
Let's do that

129
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:32,100
So "passwd root"

130
00:07:32,100 --> 00:07:33,700
What shall it be, the new password?

131
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:36,900
I'm just gonna type in exactly the same one as I've typed in before

132
00:07:36,900 --> 00:07:38,200
but you get the idea.

133
00:07:38,200 --> 00:07:40,320
You can type in whatever you want here.

134
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:42,200
Excellent

135
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:46,000
So it says "passwd: password updated successfully"

136
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,500
Now what we want to do is reboot and do a regular boot.

137
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:51,500
So we get the graphical user interface as well

138
00:07:51,500 --> 00:07:53,900
and we get full screen here in VirtualBox

139
00:07:53,900 --> 00:07:56,500
and we get a bit of a prettier environment as well

140
00:07:56,500 --> 00:07:58,100
So just go ahead and reboot

141
00:07:58,100 --> 00:08:06,500
You will of course need to undo the changes.

142
00:08:06,500 --> 00:08:09,900
Okay, so this approach comes with certain problems.

143
00:08:09,900 --> 00:08:17,000
Let's just power off the machine.

144
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:19,279
You do not wish to power off as well

145
00:08:19,279 --> 00:08:21,600
Amazing

146
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:25,479
As you just see, this does come with a few drawbacks.

147
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:28,900
It is not as convenient, but oh well.

148
00:08:28,900 --> 00:08:29,900
It doesn't really matter.

149
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,600
What you would do in a physical machine then

150
00:08:32,600 --> 00:08:37,000
if you don't bother yourself with figuring out what the problem is here.

151
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:39,189
I, of course, have to go like this

152
00:08:39,189 --> 00:08:42,600
and you'll probably have to do it like this on your virtualizer

153
00:08:42,600 --> 00:08:43,900
which is probably VirtualBox

154
00:08:43,900 --> 00:08:46,500
but I have seen that some people have been using VMware

155
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:47,800
in the discussion section

156
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:51,000
as they've had some problems with the VirtualBox

157
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:55,000
As I said, you can either try to figure out what is the problem here

158
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:00,000
and it says it's better if you shut down instead of power off on the command line

159
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:01,300
or something like that.

160
00:09:01,300 --> 00:09:05,500
You can try typing in some other commands, but honestly why bother?

161
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:08,200
Just press the reset button on your computer

162
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,000
and let that be the end of it.

163
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,600
Reset

164
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:23,000
It's booting up

165
00:09:23,000 --> 00:09:27,300
Oh, excellent! That has deleted been by default and it's clean.

166
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:30,000
So if you mess something up here, just reboot the machine

167
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:36,139
and the clean up operation will be done for you.

168
00:09:36,139 --> 00:09:46,000
Uh, exit from here? I don't really want to

169
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,000
Nevermind, I'm just going to reset it again.

170
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:54,500
Not a good idea to do these sort of things in a VirtualBox

171
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:57,509
or in pretty much any virtualizer.

172
00:09:57,509 --> 00:10:03,800
They can present problems in a VirtualBox

173
00:10:03,800 --> 00:10:06,000
primarily because it is not a physical machine.

174
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:08,000
It doesn't work...

175
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:12,200
I mean, not in exactly the same way.

176
00:10:12,200 --> 00:10:14,400
Anyway, I am rebooting it here

177
00:10:14,400 --> 00:10:18,300
and we're gonna get into the system

178
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:20,300
and we will be root.

179
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:22,300
So not yet, but now we know the password

180
00:10:22,300 --> 00:10:23,600
because we have changed it.

181
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:32,000
Although this method does not enable you to actually get the password itself.

182
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,700
Rather instead, it allows you to only change it

183
00:10:34,700 --> 00:10:36,300
but we obviously needed to do that

184
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,800
because we need root password

185
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,300
if we are to actually access the etc passwd and etc shadow file

186
00:10:43,300 --> 00:10:46,300
where the password is actually hashed

187
00:10:46,300 --> 00:10:47,700
and let me show you that.

188
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,800
This is where Linux stores its password

189
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:53,300
You need to become root for this

190
00:10:53,300 --> 00:10:55,200
and now we know the root password.

191
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:06,500
So let's just type in "cat /etc/shadow

192
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:07,300
Excellent

193
00:11:07,300 --> 00:11:11,000
So you see here it says "test", which is my user

194
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:14,200
and then there is some sort of a hash over here.

195
00:11:14,200 --> 00:11:18,760
That it's not pretty to look at, but what can you really do about it?

196
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:23,200
You can crack it I suppose, but that's about it.

197
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:24,400
Excellent

198
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:29,199
The route is the first one, and then there's the hash here as well.

199
00:11:29,199 --> 00:11:31,100
Now we need to actually crack this.

200
00:11:31,100 --> 00:11:33,500
Let me just go ahead and clear the screen.

201
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:34,700
In the follow-up tutorial

202
00:11:34,700 --> 00:11:37,990
I'm gonna show you how you can actually extract this hash

203
00:11:37,990 --> 00:11:40,200
and how you can crack it.

204
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,490
Now this particular tutorial or these few tutorials

205
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:46,600
will be for a Linux type system

206
00:11:46,600 --> 00:11:50,300
and then we'll move on in the next tutorials to a Windows-based system

207
00:11:50,300 --> 00:11:55,000
but remember that we need to obtain root privileges on a system

208
00:11:55,000 --> 00:11:58,000
or admin privileges on a Windows system

209
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,000
before we will be able to do these sort of things

210
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:05,000
in order to extract the passwords themselves

211
00:12:05,000 --> 00:12:06,500
Why should you do this?

212
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:08,900
I mean, if you already have root access to the system

213
00:12:08,900 --> 00:12:11,149
well, you might want to extract the system password

214
00:12:11,149 --> 00:12:15,500
primarily because people tend to repeat the passwords

215
00:12:15,500 --> 00:12:17,200
and they might have used it elsewhere

216
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:18,400
or something of a kind

217
00:12:18,400 --> 00:12:22,810
or your contractor might just say "Hey, I want the password"

218
00:12:22,810 --> 00:12:27,600
"I don't necessarily want just root access...

219
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,800
...but rather instead, I want the password for whatever reasons"

220
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,600
As I said, people tend to distribute them over the other accounts

221
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:36,800
or something of a kind

222
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,700
and they can use it to log in elsewhere as well.

223
00:12:40,700 --> 00:12:42,500
In any case, I bid you farewell

224
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,300
and I hope to see you see you in the follow-up tutorial.
