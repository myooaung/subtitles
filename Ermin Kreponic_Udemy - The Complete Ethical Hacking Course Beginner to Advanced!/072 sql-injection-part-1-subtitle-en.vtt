00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000

Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:08.000

Today I will begin a chapter on SQL injections.



3

00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.100

Now before we actually begin the chapter itself and before I get into the injections themselves



4

00:00:14.100 --> 00:00:18.200

before I do demos with this attack method



5

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:24.400

and demonstrate in great detail how you can perform it, I do need to explain a few things first.



6

00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.800

So what is an SQL injection?



7

00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:29.400

In general, what do you think it is?



8

00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:38.600

Well basically, as the name itself says, you're just injecting SQL queries into your HTTP request methods



9

00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:43.000

or somewhere else on the site.



10

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.900

What you are doing with this



11

00:00:45.900 --> 00:00:56.100

you are effectively pulling the database information that exists behind a web server...



12

00:00:56.100 --> 00:01:02.900

Basically there is a website, and that website pulls the information from a certain database



13

00:01:02.900 --> 00:01:05.900

in order to be displayed on that particular website.



14

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:11.900

That is the way in which user names and passwords are actually verified.



15

00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:13.200

You type it in



16

00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:18.000

The web server takes it in...



17

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.700

Actually, not the web server itself



18

00:01:19.700 --> 00:01:22.800

Rather instead, the web app that you have on your web server



19

00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.000

takes in your user credentials.



20

00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:30.400

It compares them to the user credentials, which are stored in the database.



21

00:01:30.400 --> 00:01:33.900

If they match, you get logged in.



22

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:38.100

If not, your access is denied.



23

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:40.560

However, more often than not



24

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:47.000

user credentials, especially passwords, within the databases are encrypted



25

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:52.800

and that can be a problem, especially if they have MD5 hashes.



26

00:01:52.800 --> 00:01:54.900

It's not easy to break.



27

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:59.189

There is a possibility always, but it can take a longer period of time



28

00:01:59.189 --> 00:02:03.130

and if somebody is using a crazy long password or something of a kind



29

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:06.000

yeah, that's not gonna happen



30

00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.800

and you might think now "Well, why do we have to do this?"



31

00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.800

"Why should we do this at all, because if we can't get the user credentials, then why does it matter?"



32

00:02:13.800 --> 00:02:17.200

It DOES matter. It does matter to a great deal.



33

00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.200

First of all, you can get encrypted user credentials



34

00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:24.700

and then you can use multiple computers to decrypt them in a shorter amount of time.



35

00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.300

That's one way



36

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:29.000

or you can extract other useful information



37

00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.700

and you might wonder "Well, what other useful information is there?



38

00:02:32.700 --> 00:02:34.200

"What can we use?"



39

00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:40.000

Well, let me just remind you of a case that happened...



40

00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000

Actually this happens on a daily basis, but you don't really find it in the news or anything of a kind.



41

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000

A group of hackers,  black hat hackers



42

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:56.600

they broke into a database, and even though the user credentials were encrypted



43

00:02:56.600 --> 00:03:01.000

they were very well encrypted and they had really good policies for passwords.



44

00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.200

So it really wasn't likely that they would ever get decrypted



45

00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:09.200

that they would ever log in as those particular users.



46

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:13.800

However, credit card information



47

00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:15.200

credit card numbers



48

00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:20.000

they were in plain text format and they could be read



49

00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.800

so they took about 50,000 credit cards.



50

00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:28.800

Just imagine how many people were affected by this.



51

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:33.200

50,000 credit cards were stolen!



52

00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:37.600

I mean, what they did with them was probably that they sell them



53

00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.400

or they tried to use some of them on the net, or something of a kind, to wash the money



54

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:47.500

but either way, I'm just trying to make a point here



55

00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:53.500

that user credentials are not the only useful type of information in a database.



56

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:58.300

There is loads of stuff, and not just credit card credentials or something of a kind



57

00:03:58.300 --> 00:04:01.000

there is loads of other stuff that you can find there



58

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.800

that you can extract, depending on what the site is.



59

00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:08.300

Sometimes you won't be able to get the password



60

00:04:08.300 --> 00:04:13.200

but you will get a large amount of information in regard to a certain user.



61

00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.200

You will get pretty much whatever you want to get without actually authenticated at all.



62

00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.200

So whatever you wanted to do after the deauthentications



63

00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:25.430

if you wanted to steal a password, for example



64

00:04:25.430 --> 00:04:29.000

then log in as that user and then do something



65

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.500

take some information there



66

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:36.200

you will be able to take it this way without ever having to log in, which is fantastic



67

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.000

because you leave....you don't leave...



68

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:41.500

I mean still, your connection of course



69

00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.500

gets logged by the server and it can be problematic



70

00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:49.600

but you can also issue commands to delete certain entries in the database



71

00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:52.500

not just the SQL, but others as well



72

00:04:52.500 --> 00:04:57.000

and there are some logs there, you can delete them.



73

00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.800

Sometimes you can even inject code, but that's not likely.



74

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:07.700

However, you can actually inject SQL queries and that is code in it of itself



75

00:05:07.700 --> 00:05:10.800

so you can do a lot of stuff there.



76

00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:15.900

Anyway, without further ado, let's go ahead and set up a virtual lab



77

00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:21.000

because we can't actually go doing this on random websites.



78

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.100

As I said before, it's illegal and you can't do it...



79

00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:25.100

You shouldn't do it



80

00:05:25.100 --> 00:05:26.800

I mean physically you can, of course



81

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.000

technically you can, but you really shouldn't



82

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.500

primarily because it's illegal



83

00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:36.800

and I know I'm probably getting on somebody's nerves by repeating this.



84

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.200

I am sorry for that, but it is necessary.



85

00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.700

I don't now, I feel a bit better by just saying that you shouldn't do it like that.



86

00:05:44.700 --> 00:05:47.900

There is no reason to do it illegally or anything of a kind



87

00:05:47.900 --> 00:05:53.000

when you can set up a perfectly functional pen testing lab on your own computer



88

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.400

on your own machine, where you can tune the difficulties, tune the defensive measures, etc



89

00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:01.750

and then attempt to bypass them in peace



90

00:06:01.750 --> 00:06:05.800

without thinking that you're going to get caught or something of a kind.



91

00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:11.100

Anyway, one of the first things that we're gonna need to download for this tutorial



92

00:06:11.100 --> 00:06:15.700

is Damn Vulnerable Web Application.



93

00:06:15.700 --> 00:06:17.300

So we need this



94

00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:23.600

Pardon for the expression, but that's the actual name of the web app.



95

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:32.300

You need to go ahead and visit this website --  www.dvwa.co.uk



96

00:06:32.300 --> 00:06:34.200

Go ahead and click on "Download"



97

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:37.800

I think I've downloaded it like five times by now



98

00:06:37.800 --> 00:06:41.900

because surprisingly somehow I've been managing to mess up my recordings.



99

00:06:41.900 --> 00:06:44.200

Save file, press okay



100

00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.400

Go ahead and navigate over to your downloads folder



101

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:50.200

or you can just go ahead and directly open it from here.



102

00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:51.699

So one more time



103

00:06:51.699 --> 00:06:56.500

Click on the arrow in the upper right corner, click on the zip file.



104

00:06:56.500 --> 00:06:59.300

You will see there is something here.



105

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.430

Just click extract, and once you click extract here



106

00:07:03.430 --> 00:07:06.200

files will be extracted to your default folder.



107

00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:08.000

Click "Quit"



108

00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.800

Your default folder for downloads is actually "Downloads"



109

00:07:11.800 --> 00:07:15.200

So go ahead and navigate over to your home folder.



110

00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:16.600

There we go



111

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.500

and go ahead and click on "Downloads"



112

00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.000

There we go



113

00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:24.900

So it says DVWA



114

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:27.200

That's the file which we have extracted.



115

00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:34.200

I'm pretty sure I have extracted here



116

00:07:34.200 --> 00:07:35.700

Yep, there we go



117

00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:40.200

Anyway, so it's DVWA 1.0.8



118

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:44.600

I have extracted it several times and not sure where the files are going anymore



119

00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.600

but it's gonna be in the downloads folder.



120

00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:48.900

If you don't want to open it from here, from the browser



121

00:07:48.900 --> 00:07:51.800

just go ahead then navigate over to your downloads folder



122

00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:52.500

and there you go



123

00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.900

I have a zipped file



124

00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:55.200

I have three of them



125

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.000

Three exactly the same files



126

00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.800

Double click on it



127

00:08:00.800 --> 00:08:02.700

Click "extract" again



128

00:08:02.700 --> 00:08:07.700

and click "extract" here, and that's it.



129

00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:09.300

No problems there.



130

00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:13.539

My existing one just got overwritten and that's why I was a bit confused.



131

00:08:13.539 --> 00:08:15.600

I didn't have two of them.



132

00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:20.200

It says here "Overwrite existing files", "Recreate folders"



133

00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:23.200

but anyway, that's why I was confused.



134

00:08:23.200 --> 00:08:25.900

I thought I would have two of them, but apparently I have one



135

00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:27.500

because it was overwritten.



136

00:08:27.500 --> 00:08:29.300

Anyway, enough of that.



137

00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:33.000

So we have our folder here, it's downloaded



138

00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000

and now we need to copy it to our default web servers folder.



139

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.300

Go ahead and open up your terminal.



140

00:08:39.300 --> 00:08:46.400

Type in the following command -- "cp -Rv"



141

00:08:46.400 --> 00:08:52.300

Capital R is for recursive mode, so it cp's all the subfolders as well



142

00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:59.900

and v for verbosity, so the cp command would tell you what exactly is it copying.



143

00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:13.000

Go ahead and type in " /home/ "



144

00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:14.500

No, not home. Sorry



145

00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:17.000

/root/



146

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:27.000

Ugh, come on. Why are you doing this to me?



147

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:31.500

I am amazing. I am truly amazing.



148

00:09:31.500 --> 00:09:36.000

Let's see where this is



149

00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:39.000

Oh, it's in /home/test/Downloads. Okay, sorry.



150

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.900

I am logged in as my regular user at the moment.



151

00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:44.000

I didn't realize that.



152

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:53.800

So just type in cp -Rv /home/ Your Username



153

00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.300

My username is "test"



154

00:09:55.300 --> 00:10:01.500

Yours is probably something that you typed in, but mine is test



155

00:10:01.500 --> 00:10:08.500

and then type in " /Downloads/DVWA 1.0.8"



156

00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:09.700

There we go



157

00:10:09.700 --> 00:10:13.000

So this folder is the one that you need to copy



158

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:20.500

and this folder you're going to copy into "/var/www/", press ENTER



159

00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:21.200

and there we go.



160

00:10:21.200 --> 00:10:22.800

I have completed the copy.



161

00:10:22.800 --> 00:10:32.000

You can see the machine has actually told me every single file that it has copied.



162

00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.900

Now if you have been following through my other tutorials



163

00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:39.400

you might have some other files in this folder.



164

00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:46.000

Before I actually began this tutorial, I cleaned this folder



165

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.200

"pwd" -- Print Working Directory



166

00:10:51.200 --> 00:10:58.900

So if you have anything within this folder, you should really delete it prior to copying this



167

00:10:58.900 --> 00:11:01.900

or you can actually copy this and then delete everything else



168

00:11:01.900 --> 00:11:05.600

but it's gonna be easier before the copying itself happens.



169

00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:14.300

Just make sure that there is nothing that will interfere, in any way or manner, with your web application.



170

00:11:14.300 --> 00:11:16.900

However, you know what you're doing.



171

00:11:16.900 --> 00:11:20.900

You can have other things lying around here, no problems.



172

00:11:20.900 --> 00:11:24.900

Anyway, that would be it for this introductory video.



173

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:33.000

I will continue immediately, in the next tutorial, from exactly where we left off now.



174

00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:36.400

However, until then, I bid you all farewell



175

00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:38.300

and before I finish this tutorial



176

00:11:38.300 --> 00:11:43.700

I would like to mention that I have been reviewing user requests



177

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:47.230

and there have been some people who have been asking for some additional tutorials



178

00:11:47.230 --> 00:11:49.400

on some very specific subjects.



179

00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:51.070

I will take them into consideration.



180

00:11:51.070 --> 00:11:52.400

I'll see if I can do them.



181

00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:56.500

If I can, time wise, I will.



182

00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:02.380

However, please feel free to keep on posting your requests, demands, or whatever you wish.



183

00:12:02.380 --> 00:12:04.200

If you have a specific wish



184

00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:10.400

"Okay, I want to have a tutorial on how to do this particular thing within the realm of ethical hacking"



185

00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:11.500

feel free to post it.



186

00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:13.880

I mean, I can't promise that I'll do it



187

00:12:13.880 --> 00:12:15.200

but I'll definitely read it



188

00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:19.970

and there is a chance that I will, if I manage to get the time



189

00:12:19.970 --> 00:12:23.800

or if I get enough requests, or something of a kind



190

00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.300

but I will read it and I will consider it for sure, that much I guarantee it to you.



191

00:12:28.300 --> 00:12:32.000

Anyway, I bid you farewell and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
