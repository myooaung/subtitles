00:00:00.360 --> 00:00:02.630

Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:02.630 --> 00:00:04.110

Today I am going to go ahead and start



3

00:00:05.150 --> 00:00:09.970

using the tools which I have previously
mentioned, dnschef and Set toolkit.



4

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:14.330

Now Set Toolkit,
well it's actually called Set, but



5

00:00:14.330 --> 00:00:18.350

here you're gonna invoke it
with a command Set Toolkit.



6

00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.970

Anyway, We're going to use
it to clone a website.



7

00:00:22.970 --> 00:00:30.110

And we're going to use dnschef to
redirect all requests to that website,



8

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:35.470

from the machines which answer to our
DNS servers to a particular IP address.



9

00:00:35.470 --> 00:00:39.850

Now if this sounds a bit complex, or if
you didn't understand exactly what I said.



10

00:00:39.850 --> 00:00:40.700

Bear with me for



11

00:00:40.700 --> 00:00:45.920

a moment here, and soon you will
realize very fast what I meant by it.



12

00:00:45.920 --> 00:00:50.110

So let's just go ahead and
bring up this dnschef command here,



13

00:00:50.110 --> 00:00:52.040

you can do this manually as well.



14

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.953

You can actually configure
a DNS server to run locally.



15

00:00:55.953 --> 00:01:01.071

And to conduct host name
to IP address resolutions.



16

00:01:01.071 --> 00:01:03.769

But that's a bit complex, and
there's a lot of configuration involved.



17

00:01:03.769 --> 00:01:07.908

It's a lot simpler to just
use the dnschef tool kit.



18

00:01:07.908 --> 00:01:13.943

And here you have these arguments,
which I've mentioned just now.



19

00:01:13.943 --> 00:01:19.065

Where a domain name gets
resolved to an IP address.



20

00:01:19.065 --> 00:01:21.550

So basically give any IP
address that you want here.



21

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:23.928

Basically that will be
of your own web server.



22

00:01:23.928 --> 00:01:26.760

So your own IP address within LAN.



23

00:01:26.760 --> 00:01:28.690

And here you have a fake domains.



24

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:33.510

So you give a name of a real domain,
and specify an interface.



25

00:01:33.510 --> 00:01:36.000

Now here's what I mean by this.



26

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.790

Here where it says fakeip,
this can be your IP within LAN on which



27

00:01:38.790 --> 00:01:41.960

your Apache server is running,
your web server.



28

00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:46.607

Or you can give it your public IP address.



29

00:01:46.607 --> 00:01:48.441

So if give it your public IP address,



30

00:01:48.441 --> 00:01:51.590

you're going to need to do some
configuration on your router.



31

00:01:51.590 --> 00:01:55.142

In order to let traffic
pass to your web server.



32

00:01:55.142 --> 00:01:58.000

However, this is not really advisable.



33

00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.605

Rather, instead,
what is far better is to have a VPN.



34

00:02:01.605 --> 00:02:04.718

I have showed you in the previous
tutorials how you can use, and



35

00:02:04.718 --> 00:02:06.260

configure with VPN services.



36

00:02:07.330 --> 00:02:08.340

Quite simple, actually.



37

00:02:08.340 --> 00:02:09.890

Nothing much to it.



38

00:02:09.890 --> 00:02:11.510

It's in your Network Manager.



39

00:02:11.510 --> 00:02:14.340

You just add a VPN of a different kind,
and that's it.



40

00:02:14.340 --> 00:02:18.790

You need PPTP VPN with
a static IP address.



41

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:22.530

Think it's gonna cost you about ten
bucks a month, something like that,



42

00:02:22.530 --> 00:02:23.340

if you wanna run it.



43

00:02:25.140 --> 00:02:30.098

If you want to do this attack over outside
of your LAN network, but within LAN,



44

00:02:30.098 --> 00:02:32.819

we're gonna use some local IP addresses.



45

00:02:32.819 --> 00:02:37.170

Now key thing to note,
there is no difference here literally.



46

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:41.021

Between an attack within your own network,
or outside of your own network.



47

00:02:41.021 --> 00:02:43.130

The only difference is the IP
addresses that are used.



48

00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:44.960

And the second thing,



49

00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:50.140

this will pretty much work with
every single website out there.



50

00:02:50.140 --> 00:02:54.800

However there are some caching
problems with browsers.



51

00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:59.100

So that can present
some difficulties here.



52

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:00.370

But we'll see how we'll see how it goes.



53

00:03:00.370 --> 00:03:01.094

First of all we've infected
a router with our own DNS.



54

00:03:01.094 --> 00:03:02.711

We've changed the DNS settings there.



55

00:03:02.711 --> 00:03:04.933

And now we're gonna run dnschef.



56

00:03:04.933 --> 00:03:08.453

Now the interface specification is
simply the interface you are using.



57

00:03:08.453 --> 00:03:11.694

If you're not sure which interface you are
using, you can check that with if config.



58

00:03:11.694 --> 00:03:13.995

Which I have showed you in
the previous tutorials.



59

00:03:13.995 --> 00:03:16.087

Or you can actually type in all zeros.



60

00:03:16.087 --> 00:03:17.975

So, instead of 192 you can type in a 0.



61

00:03:17.975 --> 00:03:19.926

Instead of 168, a 0.



62

00:03:19.926 --> 00:03:21.313

Instead of 1, a 0.



63

00:03:21.313 --> 00:03:24.630

And instead of 102 a 0 as well.



64

00:03:24.630 --> 00:03:30.196

Yeah, this should work as far as I see.



65

00:03:30.196 --> 00:03:34.166

But as the tutorial progresses,
I'll see how it goes.



66

00:03:34.166 --> 00:03:36.619

I did give it a shot a couple of
times before this tutorial and



67

00:03:36.619 --> 00:03:37.510

I had some problems.



68

00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.710

Hopefully, you will not
encounter the same.



69

00:03:40.710 --> 00:03:43.850

I've had some problems due to
the configuration that I am running



70

00:03:43.850 --> 00:03:44.540

in the background.



71

00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:48.240

But I had to change a lot of things.



72

00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:51.190

But none of those things,
you won't need to do any of those things.



73

00:03:51.190 --> 00:03:54.470

Primarily, because you're going to be
using your home computer where you don't



74

00:03:54.470 --> 00:03:58.400

have these crazy things
that I have here as well.



75

00:03:58.400 --> 00:03:59.730

Anyway enough of that nonsense.



76

00:03:59.730 --> 00:04:02.710

I'm just going to go ahead and run this.



77

00:04:04.460 --> 00:04:08.920

And in case you didn't figure
out what these IP addresses are,



78

00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:12.570

let me just type in ifconfig,
and there you go.



79

00:04:12.570 --> 00:04:14.712

Eth0 that's the interface that I
used to connect to the internet.



80

00:04:14.712 --> 00:04:20.780

And that's the LAN IP address
that I have been assigned.



81

00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:22.570

192.168.1.102.
That is the same IP address with which we



82

00:04:22.570 --> 00:04:27.460

have typed into our router to
be our designated DNS server.



83

00:04:28.690 --> 00:04:30.150

But this is randomname.com.



84

00:04:30.150 --> 00:04:33.771

Okay, that's not gonna work,
probably, because randomname.com.



85

00:04:33.771 --> 00:04:37.291

Okay, it might exist, but
I honestly don't know.



86

00:04:37.291 --> 00:04:40.451

So let's just go over and
pick one website.



87

00:04:40.451 --> 00:04:44.491

We're not really gonna do anything to
a website, so it doesn't really matter.



88

00:04:44.491 --> 00:04:49.536

My favorite forum, Linux Questions.



89

00:04:49.536 --> 00:04:52.790

This is definitely the place to be.



90

00:04:52.790 --> 00:04:57.100

The amount of answers that
people give here is amazing.



91

00:04:57.100 --> 00:05:00.856

And I don't think anybody's going to every
going to try to hack your user name and



92

00:05:00.856 --> 00:05:02.083

password for this forum.



93

00:05:02.083 --> 00:05:03.522

Primarily because there is no point.



94

00:05:03.522 --> 00:05:05.901

There are no finances here or
anything of this kind.



95

00:05:05.901 --> 00:05:09.440

This is just people
helping one another out.



96

00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:12.360

We're just going to go ahead and
copy this.



97

00:05:14.540 --> 00:05:18.000

Minimize the browser,
reinvoke our command.



98

00:05:19.430 --> 00:05:21.170

Where it says fake domain.



99

00:05:22.770 --> 00:05:27.800

Got to delete this,
paste linuxquestions.org.



100

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:28.730

Go ahead and press enter.



101

00:05:28.730 --> 00:05:34.520

And that's gonna resolve all requests
on our DNS servers from that.



102

00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.860

All the requests that have
the linuxquestions.org will inevitably be



103

00:05:38.860 --> 00:05:42.220

resolved to this IP address here,
which is our own website server.



104

00:05:42.220 --> 00:05:46.600

But that's not gonna do us much good, if
we don't have a web server that's running.



105

00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:50.270

So let's just take of that shall we?



106

00:05:50.270 --> 00:05:52.260

Clear the screen.



107

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.880

Do I have anything of importance here?



108

00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:56.441

No I do not.



109

00:05:56.441 --> 00:06:00.023

Now we need to do a set tool kit.



110

00:06:00.023 --> 00:06:04.259

setoolkit.



111

00:06:04.259 --> 00:06:05.976

Keynote there is no double t here.



112

00:06:05.976 --> 00:06:08.304

So set and then double o.



113

00:06:08.304 --> 00:06:13.330

Press Enter, and
this tool is extremely easy to use.



114

00:06:13.330 --> 00:06:14.418

I mean, there isn't really much to it.



115

00:06:16.615 --> 00:06:17.610

It's very powerful, but it's very simple.



116

00:06:17.610 --> 00:06:25.130

I have no idea how they achieved to
do this, but apparently they have.



117

00:06:25.130 --> 00:06:29.540

Anyway, you have a great deal of
options here which you can use.



118

00:06:29.540 --> 00:06:33.730

I would definitely advise that
you try some of them out.



119

00:06:33.730 --> 00:06:36.360

Definitely type in 6 for
help, see what's there.



120

00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:38.600

Just read a little bit through it.



121

00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:41.280

I mean, you're probably not
gonna try all of them out, but



122

00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:46.020

I would definitely advise that you
pick a couple, or at least one.



123

00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.370

Other than the one that we're going
to use today, and see how it works.



124

00:06:51.370 --> 00:06:53.060

All of these things have
their own submenus.



125

00:06:53.060 --> 00:06:54.790

So let's go into
Social-Engineering Attacks.



126

00:06:54.790 --> 00:06:58.224

See, there is like,
Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors,



127

00:06:58.224 --> 00:07:02.803

Website Attack Vectors, Infectious
Media Generator, Create a Payload,



128

00:07:02.803 --> 00:07:06.180

Mass Mailer,
except there are lots of things here.



129

00:07:06.180 --> 00:07:10.040

You can conclude what they are for
a lot of them just by reading the names.



130

00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:12.690

But I would definitely advise
you to read a bit more.



131

00:07:12.690 --> 00:07:16.760

And to just try, try ,try some of
these things because there's so



132

00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:17.670

many options here.



133

00:07:17.670 --> 00:07:19.670

There's so many vectors of attack.



134

00:07:19.670 --> 00:07:20.170

It's ridiculous.



135

00:07:21.380 --> 00:07:23.040

It's something,



136

00:07:23.040 --> 00:07:29.260

something is bound to work on the site
that you want to do something on.



137

00:07:29.260 --> 00:07:30.430

Something's bound to work.



138

00:07:30.430 --> 00:07:34.765

Not only setoolkit, but you have so many
tools here in Kali Linux, and on the net.



139

00:07:34.765 --> 00:07:38.360

So many options, something's bound
to work, so don't worry about it.



140

00:07:39.500 --> 00:07:42.633

Anyway, what we need is
Website Attack Vectors.



141

00:07:42.633 --> 00:07:44.929

Because we're gonna be doing that.



142

00:07:44.929 --> 00:07:48.184

And again, we have sub menus,
a lot of them.



143

00:07:48.184 --> 00:07:50.723

Let's go with
Credential Harvester Attack Method.



144

00:07:50.723 --> 00:07:52.568

Because we want to take some credentials.



145

00:07:52.568 --> 00:07:56.824

So press three, and
now we want a Site Cloner.



146

00:07:56.824 --> 00:08:01.835

So we want to clone the site, and
have it stored on our local web server.



147

00:08:01.835 --> 00:08:03.051

This is web templates.



148

00:08:03.051 --> 00:08:05.943

You can have a web template
that is standing by somewhere.



149

00:08:05.943 --> 00:08:08.517

You can clone a site or
you can custom import.



150

00:08:08.517 --> 00:08:11.350

Anyway, press two.



151

00:08:11.350 --> 00:08:14.660

IP address, so I need the IP address.



152

00:08:14.660 --> 00:08:20.270

And in order to get the IP address I'm
afraid I'm gonna need to use a ping.



153

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:24.270

But just zoom in



154

00:08:24.270 --> 00:08:29.810

a little bit nslookup



155

00:08:29.810 --> 00:08:36.284

linuxquestions.org.



156

00:08:36.284 --> 00:08:41.329

Amazing, amazing, nslookup.



157

00:08:41.329 --> 00:08:47.055

Okay, so this is the domain and
this is the IP address.



158

00:08:47.055 --> 00:08:48.603

We'll just do this instead.



159

00:08:48.603 --> 00:08:51.110

You can also check it like this,
it's a lot simpler.



160

00:08:51.110 --> 00:08:52.827

Just type in ping.



161

00:08:52.827 --> 00:08:54.043

And there we go.



162

00:08:56.827 --> 00:09:02.501

Same IP address just a different method I
suppose I'd want to choose something else.



163

00:09:02.501 --> 00:09:06.457

So IP address but we don't
actually have the IP address here.



164

00:09:06.457 --> 00:09:07.685

Sorry this is my mistake.



165

00:09:07.685 --> 00:09:12.060

This option is used for
what the server in the post do.



166

00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:13.630

So sorry.
This is my bad.



167

00:09:13.630 --> 00:09:19.130

You need to type in 192.168.1.102.



168

00:09:19.130 --> 00:09:22.663

Basically this your IP address.



169

00:09:22.663 --> 00:09:23.870

And for
the post back in Harvester/Tabnabbing.



170

00:09:23.870 --> 00:09:27.290

If you are, yep.



171

00:09:27.290 --> 00:09:28.080

Here we go.



172

00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:31.230

So, it also says if you
are using external IP address,



173

00:09:32.270 --> 00:09:34.640

use your external IP address for this.



174

00:09:34.640 --> 00:09:38.230

But we are obviously not going to
use our external IP addresses.



175

00:09:38.230 --> 00:09:41.110

Not today, but
of course you can if you have a VPN.



176

00:09:41.110 --> 00:09:43.679

Press ENTER here and
now we need a domain name.



177

00:09:43.679 --> 00:09:46.255

The full thing with HTTP and WWW.



178

00:09:46.255 --> 00:09:48.943

Easiest way is just to go ahead and



179

00:09:48.943 --> 00:09:54.070

CTRL+C, and then paste it back in here,
and there you go.



180

00:09:54.070 --> 00:10:00.570

Notice that the protocol is HTTP,
but this works with HTTPS as well.



181

00:10:00.570 --> 00:10:01.810

There's literally no difference,



182

00:10:01.810 --> 00:10:05.880

just type in HTTPS and
it's gonna clone it no problem.



183

00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:11.140

So you can see here, in the title it
says SET supports both HTTP and HTTPS.



184

00:10:11.140 --> 00:10:12.600

You don't have to worry about it.



185

00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.900

It says right here in the title.



186

00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.320

And I have tried it out
with some HTTPS sites.



187

00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:18.990

It does indeed work, no problems at all.



188

00:10:20.760 --> 00:10:22.530

Okay, so let's go.



189

00:10:22.530 --> 00:10:23.460

It's cloning it.



190

00:10:23.460 --> 00:10:24.980

This could take a little bit of time.



191

00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:27.360

And there are a lot of
tutorials out there on the net.



192

00:10:27.360 --> 00:10:30.128

They basically say that you should wait,
and stay here.



193

00:10:30.128 --> 00:10:33.243

But apparently with newer versions of SET,
you can't.



194

00:10:33.243 --> 00:10:39.002

So just go ahead and press Enter,
99 to exit, 99 to return.



195

00:10:39.002 --> 00:10:40.857

Exit Social- Engineering toolkit.



196

00:10:40.857 --> 00:10:42.670

Clear the screen, and
now we have our website cloned.



197

00:10:42.670 --> 00:10:46.560

Let me just show that to you.



198

00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:51.755

So this is LinuxQuestions.org,



199

00:10:51.755 --> 00:10:58.927

and if I type in 192.168.1.102.



200

00:10:58.927 --> 00:11:00.270

You see, there we go.



201

00:11:00.270 --> 00:11:01.800

This our IP address, and
the website is pretty much the same.



202

00:11:03.250 --> 00:11:09.900

Okay, the zoom is different,
but I suppose I can zoom it in.



203

00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:10.460

No problems there.



204

00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:17.090

Maybe, the site that we have copied is



205

00:11:18.520 --> 00:11:21.070

even better because
there are no ads on it.



206

00:11:21.070 --> 00:11:22.940

That's fantastic.



207

00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:24.330

We didn't copy the ad as well.



208

00:11:25.530 --> 00:11:28.730

And this site that we have copied it to,
the clone,



209

00:11:28.730 --> 00:11:30.530

actually contains a JavaScript in.



210

00:11:30.530 --> 00:11:33.730

Which we'll harvest the credentials
if I'm not mistaken.



211

00:11:33.730 --> 00:11:37.260

How we will do that I will show
you in the follow up tutorial.



212

00:11:37.260 --> 00:11:40.450

Where we will actually be
extracting the credentials,



213

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.730

and saving them to our
files on our computer.



214

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:47.010

Now this sort of attack is very important.



215

00:11:47.010 --> 00:11:50.160

Primarily because some of the previous
attacks which I've showed you,



216

00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:51.600

they're specific attacks.



217

00:11:51.600 --> 00:11:53.430

And this one is a general attack.



218

00:11:53.430 --> 00:11:56.350

This will work on pretty
much anything out there.



219

00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:01.920

And it can be used in combination
with SSL Strip as well.



220

00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:05.840

So imagine if you can use
SSL Strip remotely somewhere



221

00:12:05.840 --> 00:12:08.290

to to the strip the requests for
encrypted sites.



222

00:12:08.290 --> 00:12:15.260

But SSL Strip doesn't always work, so
that's kind of a tricky Thing to do.



223

00:12:15.260 --> 00:12:17.820

Anyway, I'm gonna leave
everything running like it is.



224

00:12:17.820 --> 00:12:20.230

And I bid you farewell.



225

00:12:20.230 --> 00:12:21.920

And I hope to see you
in the next tutorial.
