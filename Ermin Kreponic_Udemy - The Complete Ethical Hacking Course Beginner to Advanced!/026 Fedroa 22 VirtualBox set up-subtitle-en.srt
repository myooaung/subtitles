1
00:00:00,110 --> 00:00:07,330
Welcome all to this tutorial. Today, I am
going to go ahead and show you how you can

2
00:00:07,330 --> 00:00:15,019
set up VirtualBox with Fedora 22 and how you
can install the new Kali Sana in it. Before

3
00:00:15,019 --> 00:00:19,470
I begin, I have a few things I would like
to go over with you. First off, I would like

4
00:00:19,470 --> 00:00:27,220
to sincerely apologize for the delay. I have
reinstalled my main system and I have created

5
00:00:27,220 --> 00:00:39,530
Fedora 22 on it. Before installation and upon
installation, I've encountered a few issues

6
00:00:39,530 --> 00:00:43,890
that I needed to resolve. Let me tell you
this way: I started working one day at ten

7
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:48,989
o'clock in the morning and I ended up working
till six o'clock in the morning the next day.

8
00:00:48,989 --> 00:00:55,270
I didn't even see the time pass by. Don't
be afraid, I didn't have a lot of problems

9
00:00:55,270 --> 00:01:00,840
with VirtualBox. Actually, I did have some
problems with it. That went relatively smoothly.

10
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:09,850
In comparison to a lot of other things, namely
my sound. It just didn't want to work out.

11
00:01:09,850 --> 00:01:14,000
I first thought it didn't work well with Fedora,
then I thought didn't work well with KDE.

12
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:20,990
So, I installed the gnome and all the other
thing. I worked with Gnome, then desktop environment,

13
00:01:20,990 --> 00:01:29,340
then I went back to KDE. It was just a painful
experience all around, until I realized the

14
00:01:29,340 --> 00:01:36,520
VLC had problems in Fedora 22. I could play
everything in it. It worked properly but I

15
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:43,770
couldn't record sounds with it for some strange
reason I don't know. So I decided to go with

16
00:01:43,770 --> 00:01:49,970
another screen recorder and now it's functioning.
Now, I can actually begin recording. This

17
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:55,259
is actually the morning of that day when I
fell asleep at 6 o'clock in the morning. So,

18
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,890
I started working back at around 10 or 11.
This is the second day pretty much almost

19
00:02:00,890 --> 00:02:05,979
straight in a row. It was kind of a funny
experience. I just wanted to share that with

20
00:02:05,979 --> 00:02:13,000
you before we get started. So, first off,
what you need to do is open up a terminal.

21
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:23,060
I customized Fedora 22 appearances to my liking.
It's still a bit messed up. Okay, so let's

22
00:02:23,060 --> 00:02:32,540
use this one. Clear it. Anyway, first thing
that you will need to do, is you will need

23
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:42,840
to become root. In order to do this you must
type in SU, enter and then type in the password.

24
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,280
What was the password again for my computer?
I love reinstalling things late at night and

25
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:53,840
typing in the password. So that can be an
interesting experience. I guarantee it to

26
00:02:53,840 --> 00:03:10,319
you. Okay, let's try this one. Yes, it's that
password. Lesson learned: do not change your

27
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:16,599
passwords at 3 o'clock in the morning before
you go to sleep. It's a bad idea in general.

28
00:03:16,599 --> 00:03:27,709
Anyway, let's go ahead and type in CD -clear.
Now, what you need to do is run "dnf update."

29
00:03:27,709 --> 00:03:32,069
Notice that before we used to use "yum," now
we use "dnf." That is literally only difference

30
00:03:32,069 --> 00:03:39,519
relevant to you. Okay, so I have already done
my updates. There is no need to go over the

31
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:45,360
process. It lasted for a while. Next thing
that I want you to do, although it is not

32
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,150
mandatory. There is a web browser embedded
into KDE, it's called conqueror. You may have

33
00:03:50,150 --> 00:03:55,549
installed the gnome version of Fedora 22,
which is also fine, it's completely relevant.

34
00:03:55,549 --> 00:04:00,650
Use whichever one you want. That's just a
different desktop requirement. That's all

35
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:07,170
there is to it. As I said, primarily making
this tutorial for all those who have already

36
00:04:07,170 --> 00:04:14,700
installed Fedora 22 and have had problems
with VirtualBox. So, this is the web browser

37
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:21,709
Conqueror. You can use it, but I like to use
Firefox. So, I'll type in "dnf install firefox."

38
00:04:21,709 --> 00:04:30,520
Okay, it says nothing to do, task complete.
I already conducted the installation of Firefox.

39
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:40,650
Now, I'm going to go out and started, and
here we go. So, we are we are connected to

40
00:04:40,650 --> 00:04:48,349
the Internet, but let's go ahead and verify
that, just to be on the safe side. I type

41
00:04:48,349 --> 00:04:54,150
"ping google.com." The fact that your default
website, or your homepage opens up the browser

42
00:04:54,150 --> 00:05:02,039
is not a proof that you are connected to the
net. Those things can be cached. So, just

43
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:06,569
use the use the ping command to get a reply.
Once you get a reply, you know that you are

44
00:05:06,569 --> 00:05:10,539
connected because the packets are traveling
to God knows where, then they're coming back

45
00:05:10,539 --> 00:05:21,490
to you. Okay, so let's go ahead and first
set up our RPM fusion. Just type in "RPM fusion."

46
00:05:21,490 --> 00:05:27,909
Go ahead and go over to their website, the
first one that pops up, rpmfusion.org. On

47
00:05:27,909 --> 00:05:34,020
the main site, you literally have it here.
It says "enable RPM fusion on your system."

48
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:40,849
Then you see, "RPM fusion free for Fedora
22." Just go ahead and click on it, save file.

49
00:05:40,849 --> 00:05:49,369
Okay to download. Then click "RPM fusion non-free
for Fedora 22." Click on it, save file. Okay

50
00:05:49,369 --> 00:05:59,839
to download. I won't do this because I've
already downloaded them. They will be in your

51
00:05:59,839 --> 00:06:08,149
downloads folder. So, "cd /home/chronic/Downloads."
I have them here. Ihave downloaded Kali Linux

52
00:06:08,149 --> 00:06:14,490
as well. So, you have to go through the download
process here. All you need to do here really

53
00:06:14,490 --> 00:06:24,219
is type in "rpm -i rpmfusion." Use tab for
this, don't type in the whole thing. It says

54
00:06:24,219 --> 00:06:27,270
it's already installed-- great! Again type,
"rpm -i rpmfusion nonfree" to install the

55
00:06:27,270 --> 00:06:39,759
other one, which is nonfree. Okay, so it's
already installed, no problems. Let's go ahead

56
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:50,899
and clear the screen. Type in "dnf update"
again. I've done it so no worries there. Once

57
00:06:50,899 --> 00:06:57,529
you complete all these updates and with the
setting up of the RPM Fusion, I would recommend,

58
00:06:57,529 --> 00:07:06,659
at this point of time, to reboot your machine
and come back to this just in case. So here's

59
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:22,330
my kernel output at the time. Type "uname
-r." It's 414 200. fc22. It 
doesn't matter if yours is different, this

60
00:07:22,330 --> 00:07:29,249
procedure should be universal. It should work
across the board without any problems. Then

61
00:07:29,249 --> 00:07:38,610
again, just perform the updates. That's it.
So next up, we need to go ahead and actually

62
00:07:38,610 --> 00:07:43,559
install VirtualBox. I've already installed
it, but let's just go ahead. I haven't fixed

63
00:07:43,559 --> 00:07:48,219
the issues that I was, and that you are facing.
We're going to go ahead and do together. First

64
00:07:48,219 --> 00:08:03,809
off, type in "dnf search virtualbox." You
can see-- oh wait. I do have the kernel modules

65
00:08:03,809 --> 00:08:11,770
for my kernel. It doesn't really matter if
you don't for yours. I will show you a way

66
00:08:11,770 --> 00:08:23,619
in which to do it. So, you need to go ahead
and find this package, VirtualBox.x86_64.

67
00:08:23,619 --> 00:08:33,639
Type in, "dnf install virtualbox." Okay, so
this is going to install for you with no problems.

68
00:08:33,639 --> 00:08:39,669
I already have it here. I just don't want
to go through the installation again. There's

69
00:08:39,669 --> 00:08:45,610
truly nothing to do there, just press "y"
at a certain point of time. That's all. Next

70
00:08:45,610 --> 00:08:51,190
up, we are going to go ahead and start VirtualBox
and begin to solve the problem that you have

71
00:08:51,190 --> 00:08:57,250
been facing. So, type, "virtualbox." Okay,
so I've already made one Kali machine so I'm

72
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:04,519
going to go ahead and remove. Delete all files.
Click on new. Type in the name of your machine,

73
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:15,430
I just type in "Kali Sana." Choose Linux.
The then I'm going to type in, Debian 64-bit.

74
00:09:15,430 --> 00:09:26,720
Okay, so let's go. Next, I'm going ahead and
giving it 1.2 gigs of RAM, but you can give

75
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:34,420
less if you want. I don't think you should
go below 800. It's up to you really. See what

76
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:41,970
works best for you. Let's go, Next, create,
next, next. Here, I've noticed that a lot

77
00:09:41,970 --> 00:09:59,740
of people have been making an error by assigning
too little disk space. Some people 
give it 6 MB or 30 MB or something like that.

78
00:09:59,740 --> 00:10:09,740
There is no way that is ever going to work.
So you need to give it at least 30 GB for

79
00:10:09,740 --> 00:10:21,100
daily use, so it's go ahead and give it 30
GB. You can get away with less. I mean, you

80
00:10:21,100 --> 00:10:24,579
are going to have some files that are stored
there in addition to the instillation, and

81
00:10:24,579 --> 00:10:30,970
you will want to do some things. So, I do
believe that 30 GB is one of the optimal amounts.

82
00:10:30,970 --> 00:10:35,560
Sometimes I like to give like 128 GB, just
in case. That's just because I have a lot

83
00:10:35,560 --> 00:10:41,370
of space to waste. If you're if you're in
a tight budget in terms of disk space you

84
00:10:41,370 --> 00:10:46,509
can give a 30 gigs and you should be fine
working with no problems or anything of the

85
00:10:46,509 --> 00:10:54,189
kind. So, let's go ahead and click on create.
That's it. We have now created a Kali machine.

86
00:10:54,189 --> 00:11:01,889
What we need to do now, is go ahead and download
the Kali Sana from the net. So let's go ahead

87
00:11:01,889 --> 00:11:14,660
and open up a web browser once again. Type
in "Kali." That's all you need to do. Open

88
00:11:14,660 --> 00:11:25,060
up the first website that comes along. It's
www.Kali.org. Go into downloads, download

89
00:11:25,060 --> 00:11:31,949
Kali Linux. There it is: Kali Linux 64-bit
iso Version 2.0. I would advise you to go

90
00:11:31,949 --> 00:11:36,329
and get the torrent version because I've noticed
a lot of people have had corrupt .iso files

91
00:11:36,329 --> 00:11:40,970
due to slow connections and the breaking of
connection. So just go ahead and download

92
00:11:40,970 --> 00:11:47,209
the torrent. It's a safer way to go about
things. Anyway, just go ahead and click on

93
00:11:47,209 --> 00:11:52,829
it and the download will begin automatically.
There is nothing else that you need to do

94
00:11:52,829 --> 00:12:01,959
there. Once the download is complete, it's
about 10 minutes to downloaded, I already

95
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:12,779
downloaded it as you can see, go ahead right-click
on this. Go into settings, go into the storage

96
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:19,069
controller IDE. Click on the empty one. Click
on the blue disk image here. Choose a virtual

97
00:12:19,069 --> 00:12:42,209
CD DVD, navigate over to your downloads folder.
Is this the

98
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:48,339
right one? Hold on. There it is. This is the
iso file that I need, that I want to see.

99
00:12:48,339 --> 00:12:54,949
It is right there, .iso. Go ahead and click
on okay. so I this is a normal set up that

100
00:12:54,949 --> 00:13:00,160
we've done before. Nothing really strange
you about. Just go ahead and double-click

101
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:06,360
on the machine. You're going to get this error
message. So, failed to open a session of the

102
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:13,060
virtual machine Kali Sana. Then, you're gonna
get this error from VirtualBox as well: VirtualBox

103
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:17,120
Linux kernel driver, blah, blah, blah, was
probably not loaded. and I'm sure that all

104
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:22,040
of you have seen this message a lot of times
and this was problematic for a lot of you.

105
00:13:22,040 --> 00:13:27,910
You couldn't go pass this. I try to help out
people by manually installing the kernel drivers.

106
00:13:27,910 --> 00:13:33,269
Really, what we could do, because I didn't
have Fedora 22, and I didn't really see this,

107
00:13:33,269 --> 00:13:37,839
I didn't know you can actually do this as
well. You can just basically follow through

108
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,420
what the but the suggested solution from the
VirtualBox is. That should in itself solve

109
00:13:43,420 --> 00:13:51,129
the problem. Basically, it's instructing you
how to install the mods for the for the system

110
00:13:51,129 --> 00:13:57,959
that you're running this on. So, let's go
and expand this. We need to type this in part

111
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:11,649
that is marked with blue letters. You can
literally just copy and paste it. Just an

112
00:14:11,649 --> 00:14:21,230
error on my part, you should not copy the
quotation marks. So just, "ctrl v" then "ctrl,

113
00:14:21,230 --> 00:14:27,889
shift v." Since you are using the Fedora 22,
just replace yum with the dnf. If you type

114
00:14:27,889 --> 00:14:35,600
in yum it's automatically redirected you to
dnf, so no worries there. Either way this

115
00:14:35,600 --> 00:14:44,860
should work. If this doesn't work, you always
have the one below. This is the one that I

116
00:14:44,860 --> 00:14:52,009
actually used, so I'm gonna go ahead and go
with it. This one Below is a more general

117
00:14:52,009 --> 00:14:56,300
way of doing things. I don't know why I grabbed
the first one, but this is what we have been

118
00:14:56,300 --> 00:15:01,699
doing before. This is what we have been attempting
to do before, but you know you couldn't find

119
00:15:01,699 --> 00:15:06,389
the proper versions the system couldn't find
the proper versions and it was a pretty big

120
00:15:06,389 --> 00:15:15,990
problem. So instead, we are going to go ahead
and use this one, which is going to help you

121
00:15:15,990 --> 00:15:22,999
install the proper ones or a meta-package,
so to say, which one-size-fits-all. Let's

122
00:15:22,999 --> 00:15:30,670
go ahead and press enter. Okay, so this is
done. Now we are going to copy this one below.

123
00:15:30,670 --> 00:15:38,329
So you see, there is nothing extremely technical
about this. I mean you just basically copy/pasting

124
00:15:38,329 --> 00:15:46,220
things. The system tells you what you need
to do. Okay, so now that is done. Go ahead

125
00:15:46,220 --> 00:15:52,939
and click on abort, and I'm going click here
on "Okay. I'll close the VirtualBox. Then,

126
00:15:52,939 --> 00:16:02,100
start the VirtualBox up again and then double-click
on Kali Sana. As you can see it is booting.

127
00:16:02,100 --> 00:16:10,029
So, I am here in the boot menu and I am free
to choose what ever I wish from the options.

128
00:16:10,029 --> 00:16:14,639
In the following tutorial, I'm just going
go briefly through the installation process

129
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:23,769
of Kali Sana. That will be it. I hope that
the solution provided here does work for you.

130
00:16:23,769 --> 00:16:31,860
As you can see, this is a fresh install of
Fedora 22. I have updated it. I have imported

131
00:16:31,860 --> 00:16:42,110
the RPM fusion repositories and then I installed
VirtualBox from the RPM repositories and followed

132
00:16:42,110 --> 00:16:48,600
the suggested solution to what the error was.
As you can see, it is working without any

133
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,860
problems whatsoever. In the next tutorial,
I also promise to show you how to install

134
00:16:53,860 --> 00:17:00,509
and run Kali Sana. I mean, it's not a terribly
difficult thing to do. It's pretty straightforward.

135
00:17:00,509 --> 00:17:07,150
So, we will go through that as well. Until
then, I bid you all farewell.
