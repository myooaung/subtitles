00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:07,620
Hi everybody. Today, I am going to go ahead
and show you how to install VirtualBox guest

2
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:15,940
additions on your newly installed Kali machine.
So let's get to it. You can start up from

3
00:00:15,940 --> 00:00:21,340
here. There we go. No need to use the terminal
start it. We already have it installed. So

4
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:27,190
let's boot it up. I already have my VirtualBox
guest additions installed. The reason why

5
00:00:27,190 --> 00:00:33,809
I installed it before I gave the instructions,
and record it as I actually did the first

6
00:00:33,809 --> 00:00:42,429
time around. Well, I the screen is really
small. It's kinda hard to of squeezed things

7
00:00:42,429 --> 00:00:49,760
in there. I figured I would install it and
expand the screen and then show you in a full-size

8
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:55,479
screen all the things that you need to do.
I just think that that's a little bit more

9
00:00:55,479 --> 00:01:01,789
efficient for you to be able to see everything,
as opposed to just looking at things on a

10
00:01:01,789 --> 00:01:09,960
really small screen. So let's go ahead and
login. Hopefully you agree with me. There

11
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,619
is nothing different that you need to do.
It's like absolutely the same things. So let's

12
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:23,250
go ahead and fire up a terminal. Expand it.
I'm going to zoom in so you all can see like

13
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:38,820
these big, chunky letters. Let's go ahead
and type in "app- get upgrade && app-get upgrade."

14
00:01:38,820 --> 00:01:44,189
I've already done it so it shouldn't be long
for me. It's just going to check. This is

15
00:01:44,189 --> 00:01:48,869
the first thing that you should do, aside
from checking your Internet connection, of

16
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:56,899
course, with a ping. If the ping is functional,
it's all fine and dandy. Now, the next thing

17
00:01:56,899 --> 00:02:03,859
that you need to do is basically just type
in app – well, let's go ahead and clear

18
00:02:03,859 --> 00:02:20,350
the screen first – "app- cache search header
| grep -i linux." Then type in "uname -r."

19
00:02:20,350 --> 00:02:27,540
Let's match the output of uname -r to these
linuxs headers. We have: 400 Kali1 AMD64,

20
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:41,590
400 Kali1 all, 400 Kali1 all AMD 64 meta package.
So, we can go with the meta package, or we

21
00:02:41,590 --> 00:02:48,500
can go with the specific one. Let's go with
the meta package. I'm pretty sure that you

22
00:02:48,500 --> 00:03:04,620
will be able to go with both of them.There
we go, press enter. Working, working, working.

23
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:14,660
Any time now, my good man, any time. I know
it can be a little bit tedious. No big deal.

24
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:24,110
After you have done all of this, just in case,
repeat this again. app – get update and

25
00:03:24,110 --> 00:03:32,360
app – get upgrade, just in case. You wouldn't
believe how the problems arise from just not

26
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:41,680
staying up-to-date with packages. Now, reboot
the machine. Just go ahead and reboot it.

27
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,310
No big deal, should be fast and not waste
too much time. Afterwards, we can install

28
00:03:46,310 --> 00:03:52,040
the guest additions, reboot the machine one
more time, and that will be the end of it.

29
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:56,870
That is literally all that we will need to
do, nothing else. Nothing super important

30
00:03:56,870 --> 00:04:08,820
there. Okay, so go, go, go. These messages
can be a little bit annoying. I think you

31
00:04:08,820 --> 00:04:26,560
can make them go away if you click the other
thing, aside from the X. 
So let's go. I hate waiting for these things.

32
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:34,330
So, next thing you need to go is to click
on devices and say, insert it. So mine is

33
00:04:34,330 --> 00:04:42,260
already inserted. No big deal, but for you
it will insert it. And there's there's no

34
00:04:42,260 --> 00:04:47,780
point to insert twice. I mean, I could technically
remove it and then insert it again. There's

35
00:04:47,780 --> 00:05:00,760
much point in doing that. So just go ahead
and do this: see the media CD-ROM0, then LS

36
00:05:00,760 --> 00:05:17,370
and there you go. Then, cp VboxLinuxadditions.run
/root/desktop. I already have them there,

37
00:05:17,370 --> 00:05:20,930
but you will be able to copy them. I'm not
going to copy them twice. That was the command

38
00:05:20,930 --> 00:05:30,570
that you needed to run. Then go over to here,
cd root/desktop. Then type, ls. You will see

39
00:05:30,570 --> 00:05:38,920
VirtualBox guest additions. Here, I can run
them one more time. No big deal. It's going.

40
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:43,889
The installation is going go forward. It shouldn't
take too long. Again, I know, I know it's

41
00:05:43,889 --> 00:05:53,700
a little bit tedious to just wait through
these things, but hey. Okay, building. The

42
00:05:53,700 --> 00:06:00,810
headers for the current kernel were not found.
Okay, so yeah, these things can happen. But

43
00:06:00,810 --> 00:06:08,270
no big deal. It should still run the whole
process. You will have like 99% of all the

44
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:15,240
functionalities here that you will be able
to utilize any way you choose. Please, as

45
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:20,139
long as full-screen works, the connection
works, and copy-paste works, you are good

46
00:06:20,139 --> 00:06:26,919
to go. Okay, so there you go. That is all
you needed to do. Now all you need to type

47
00:06:26,919 --> 00:06:32,560
in is reboot. Upon reboot, you will be able
to use your VirtualBox with full screen and

48
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:37,930
pretty much all the functionalities that it
has to offer. By the way, at the end of this,

49
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:47,110
I really did not expect things to work out
with Fedora 22, Kali 20 or with the new VirtualBox.

50
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:55,490
This is because all three of those systems
are practically brand new. Things with systems

51
00:06:55,490 --> 00:07:01,210
that are brand-new tend to be buggy, problematic
and so on and so forth. So, I really didn't

52
00:07:01,210 --> 00:07:08,120
expect things to work out, but for the most
part they did. Anyway, I hope this was first

53
00:07:08,120 --> 00:07:13,230
useful tool if you were struggling with the
setup. I bid you all farewell.
