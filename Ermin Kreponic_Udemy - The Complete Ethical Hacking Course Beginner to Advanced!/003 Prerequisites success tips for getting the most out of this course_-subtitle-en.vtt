00:00:00.620 --> 00:00:03.000

Hello everybody and welcome to this

tutorial.



2

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:07.299

Today we'll be talking the prerequisites that you require



3

00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.900

if you if you want to follow this course through.



4

00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:17.200

One of the first things that you need to be familiarized with



5

00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:18.650

is your working environment.



6

00:00:18.650 --> 00:00:23.400

So for myself, I have chosen to use two Linux distros.



7

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:26.900

One will be Fedora 20, which is my



8

00:00:26.900 --> 00:00:30.100

which is the operating system that I'm using.



9

00:00:30.100 --> 00:00:31.000

Anyway



10

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:34.600

and also I will install a virtual machine.



11

00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.000

That virtual machine will be Kali Linux.



12

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:41.300

Basically, it is a Linux distro



13

00:00:41.300 --> 00:00:44.800

which contains a great deal of pen testing tools.



14

00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:46.680

So it's very useful in that sense.



15

00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.100

Don't worry about it



16

00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.800

I will explain this process in great detail



17

00:00:50.800 --> 00:00:52.800

How you can set the virtual machine up



18

00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.800

how you can install it



19

00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:57.200

and so on and so forth.



20

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.600

However, should you be using Windows



21

00:00:59.600 --> 00:01:03.900

that is definitely not advisable for this kind of activity.



22

00:01:03.900 --> 00:01:07.200

Primarily because you will



23

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:11.940

I mean, since I'm doing this in an environment that I own



24

00:01:11.950 --> 00:01:15.800

it doesn't really matter to me if I'm anonymous or not



25

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:18.000

but in the real world



26

00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.500

all the pen testing that is done in the real world



27

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.200

You're always trying to anonymize yourselves.



28

00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:27.600

You're trying to be as invisible as possible



29

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.100

as much as possible.



30

00:01:31.100 --> 00:01:35.400

You do not want them to figure out where the attack is coming from



31

00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:37.000

or anything of a kind.



32

00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:40.640

You want wipe your trail or something a

kind



33

00:01:40.640 --> 00:01:44.700

and Windows is really not good for those

sort of things.



34

00:01:44.700 --> 00:01:48.170

So there your anonymity level will be very

low



35

00:01:48.170 --> 00:01:52.119

and most of tools that we are going to be using



36

00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:54.900

They are native to the Linux environment.



37

00:01:54.900 --> 00:01:57.800

They were made for Linux



38

00:01:57.800 --> 00:02:01.600

So some of them might not work under Windows.



39

00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:03.300

I have not tested them all out.



40

00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:05.500

but most of them will



41

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:07.369

So you can still use Windows if you like



42

00:02:07.369 --> 00:02:10.770

because you're not hiding from any anyone



43

00:02:10.770 --> 00:02:14.300

but since I'm recreating the real life scenario here



44

00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:17.310

I do need to actually use proxies, VPNs



45

00:02:17.310 --> 00:02:18.300

and so on and so forth



46

00:02:18.300 --> 00:02:20.900

just to show you how it's done



47

00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:21.850

and how you can do it.



48

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:25.340

Also, for all the Mac users out there



49

00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:28.500

if you're using Mac OS X



50

00:02:28.500 --> 00:02:31.200

doesn't really matter which version.



51

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:34.100

Most of this stuff should work, like no problems.



52

00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:36.060

The procedures are fairly simpler.



53

00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:38.200

The command line tools are the same



54

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:41.900

how you install them differs



55

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:46.200

but pretty much will be able to run the same commands as me.



56

00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.400

So there shouldn't be any problems there.



57

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:52.400

Your anonymity level with Mac OS X



58

00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:54.500

should be both really good



59

00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:59.500

but still, on Linux you have the greatest anonymity



60

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:01.890

and you are rather safe in that sense.



61

00:03:01.890 --> 00:03:09.660

Other than that, you will also require a working internet connection



62

00:03:09.660 --> 00:03:13.730

and even those all of these attacks that we are going to do today



63

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:15.300

well most of them



64

00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:21.180

they work much MUCH better if you have an extremely fast connection



65

00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:26.100

but some of these attacks are actually

conducted from public wi-fi



66

00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:27.480

in real life anyway.



67

00:03:27.480 --> 00:03:30.000

We'll just pretend



68

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000

I will set up a wireless access point in my house and load it



69

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.780

so that it's similar to the public wi-fi, which is very slow.



70

00:03:37.780 --> 00:03:41.900

Some of these attacks, as I said



71

00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:43.900

they go over public wi-fi



72

00:03:43.900 --> 00:03:49.000

and as we all know and as we've all painfully learned



73

00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.900

public wi-fis are not the fastest internet connections out there.



74

00:03:52.900 --> 00:03:56.640

So primarily because you have a lot of people that are connected to them



75

00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:59.000

and there's a lot of data going through.



76

00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:05.000

They're not the safest networks out there either



77

00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.500

but if you want to absolutely anonymize yourself



78

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.400

and that is what some people do.



79

00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:13.400

They actually go out and hook up to a public wi-fi



80

00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.480

or they go to a bar, or something of the like



81

00:04:15.480 --> 00:04:19.800

and conduct their attacks from there.



82

00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:22.020

Now before they do that



83

00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.900

they need to figure out whether the bandwidth of that wi-fi



84

00:04:24.900 --> 00:04:26.700

can sustain their attacks.



85

00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:28.000

So they need to minimize.



86

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.200

they need to downsize it



87

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.700

and that is how they become absolutely anonymous.



88

00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:39.000

Anyway, the third thing that you will absolutely need



89

00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.190

so these three things



90

00:04:40.190 --> 00:04:42.200

these are the basic requirements.



91

00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:46.000

Everything else we will pick up on the way.



92

00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000

I will show you how to do it, no problems there



93

00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.400

but these three things, I can't really show you how to



94

00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:54.900

I mean I can, but it's a bit pointless



95

00:04:54.900 --> 00:04:58.500

How to go through your ISP and hook it up to the internet



96

00:04:58.500 --> 00:05:01.100

and hook your telephone through the internet



97

00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:02.700

or something of a kind



98

00:05:02.700 --> 00:05:08.700

But in any case, the third prerequisite is a

working wireless card



99

00:05:08.700 --> 00:05:11.500

and when I say "working wireless card"



100

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:13.500

most of the devices have them.



101

00:05:13.500 --> 00:05:15.800

Pretty much all laptops from 2005



102

00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:17.090

or from 2008



103

00:05:17.090 --> 00:05:19.600

were standardized with wireless cards.



104

00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:22.300

If you're using desktop machine that doesn't a wireless card



105

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:24.000

you can



106

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.020

you should



107

00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:28.600

but however, if you want



108

00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:32.900

you won't be able to follow through a portion of this tutorial then.



109

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.260

You should go out and buy a USB wireless card



110

00:05:37.260 --> 00:05:38.200

or something of a kind.



111

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.400

They're pretty cheap



112

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.780

I don't know. 10 or 15 bucks



113

00:05:40.780 --> 00:05:45.900

So they're not that expensive and you can

get them much anywhere.



114

00:05:45.900 --> 00:05:48.520

Anyway, as I was saying



115

00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:52.900

what I mean by a functional wireless network card



116

00:05:52.900 --> 00:05:57.100

is that it is recognized by your operating system.



117

00:05:57.100 --> 00:06:00.900

So if you are using a Linux distro like I am



118

00:06:00.900 --> 00:06:02.340

you need to make sure



119

00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:04.000

this Linux distro



120

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:06.000

that the kernel of this Linux distro



121

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:09.000

actually has the necessary drivers



122

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.270

for the wireless card that you are using at the moment.



123

00:06:12.270 --> 00:06:16.300

You're probably using Atheros or Broadcom.



124

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.100

Atheros should be fine.



125

00:06:18.100 --> 00:06:21.010

Pretty much an external support



126

00:06:21.010 --> 00:06:23.800

A large amount of Atheros devices, if not all of them



127

00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:27.040

in terms of network cards, that should be fine.



128

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:29.000

There were some problems with Broadcom



129

00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.800

but as far as I am informed



130

00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:32.000

that has been solved



131

00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.700

so no big deal there.



132

00:06:33.700 --> 00:06:36.100

If you are uncertain how to check



133

00:06:36.100 --> 00:06:40.900

whether your wireless card functions under Linux distro



134

00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.590

just try connecting to a wi-fi.



135

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:46.550

If you can connect to a wi-fi access point



136

00:06:46.550 --> 00:06:48.300

If you can connect, obviously it works



137

00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:50.070

If you can't, it doesn't work



138

00:06:50.070 --> 00:06:53.300

but don't just hop to a conclusion that it doesn't work.



139

00:06:53.300 --> 00:06:56.100

Maybe it's just turned off or something like that



140

00:06:56.100 --> 00:06:57.350

but do not worry



141

00:06:57.350 --> 00:07:00.500

I will show this in greater detail in the follow-up tutorials



142

00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:04.800

where we actually go over the installation process and all of that.



143

00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:07.100

Now there are a couple more things which we need to go over



144

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.800

before we head over and start the installation.



145

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.750

I would just like to go over some basic terms



146

00:07:13.750 --> 00:07:18.000

and some basic terminology



147

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.600

that you will need in order to be able to follow this course



148

00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:24.000

and for you to be able to follow the future tutorials.



149

00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.090

In any case, I bid you farewell



150

00:07:27.090 --> 00:07:27.930

and I thank you for watching.
