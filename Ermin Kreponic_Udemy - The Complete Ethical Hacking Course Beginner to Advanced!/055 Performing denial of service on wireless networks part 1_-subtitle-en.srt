00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:10,100
Today I will be talking about DoS attacks and how you can actually deny wireless access

3
00:00:10,100 --> 00:00:14,000
to pretty much anybody within the range of your wireless card.

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,000
Now your current range of you wireless card is not your permanent range

5
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:20,500
and probably it's not your maximum range

6
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,000
because you can boost signal as well

7
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:25,200
but of that, I shall speak of it later on.

8
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:30,700
For the time being, I wish to focus only on the actual DoS attack, as that can...

9
00:00:30,700 --> 00:00:35,400
Well, not only can you deny the service, but as I stated in a previous tutorial

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:40,200
you are actually able to trick the user into resetting the router

11
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:44,600
primarily because if you can't connect to your wireless, what is one of the first things that you do?

12
00:00:44,600 --> 00:00:46,700
Basically just reset the router.

13
00:00:46,700 --> 00:00:53,200
Even if you call the ISP provider, one of the first things that they will tell you is reset the router

14
00:00:53,200 --> 00:00:59,400
and these sort of attacks, unless they're going over an extended period of time or something like that

15
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,600
they don't raise a lot of suspicion.

16
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,200
I mean, most people when they can't connect wireless in their houses or something like that

17
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:07,900
well, oh well...reset the router.

18
00:01:07,900 --> 00:01:09,210
If it works out, great

19
00:01:09,210 --> 00:01:10,500
If it doesn't, oh well

20
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:12,800
Call the ISP, then they try to fix it

21
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:16,590
but you're not gonna be running the DoS attack probably for that long.

22
00:01:16,590 --> 00:01:23,000
Your idea is to force a reset, however you can run actually  permanent DoS attacks

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:29,940
and in such a way deny service to a certain user or company or something of a kind.

24
00:01:29,940 --> 00:01:34,000
There is no known way to actually stop this

25
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,500
There are, as I've stated in previous tutorials as well

26
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:43,000
you can use some paint that doesn't signals to pass through

27
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,400
or you can use some tin foil, or something like that, on the walls

28
00:01:46,400 --> 00:01:51,060
but you are effectively limiting what you can do with your own wireless in such a way

29
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:55,000
and that's not really the best of solutions.

30
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:00,500
Anyway, there are certain things that a user can do in the other side to mediate this sort of an attack

31
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:07,000
such as change the channel of their wireless access point, change the MAC address

32
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:11,200
but none of those things are actually stopping the DoS attacks

33
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,000
All of those things that they are doing is simply hiding and biding for time.

34
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,800
All you need to do is simply follow up on the changes.

35
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:23,300
For example, do a scan again

36
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:24,900
If you see that there is something wrong

37
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,700
and that's it

38
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:29,800
You will find a new MAC address, you will find a new channel

39
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,800
and you will see the new ESSID as well.

40
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:36,700
So anyway, without further ado

41
00:02:36,700 --> 00:02:43,600
let's just go ahead and perform this sort of attack, see what happens, and how can we actually confirm it.

42
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:51,000
Anyway, the first thing that we need to do is set our wireless network card into monitor mode.

43
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:54,600
I have a small script that I have written for myself here.

44
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:56,500
I have explained it in the previous tutorials.

45
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:01,200
If you're just wondering why I am not doing this by airmon -ng

46
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:08,500
"airmon -ng  start wlp2s0"

47
00:03:08,500 --> 00:03:14,000
Well, I've discovered that on Fedora, the distribution that I am using at the moment

48
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:18,500
the one I am using for the demonstration of this tutorial

49
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:20,400
well, it just presents problems.

50
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,100
I mean, it creates virtual interfaces

51
00:03:24,100 --> 00:03:27,100
and I don't know, you get an error like name not unique on the network

52
00:03:27,100 --> 00:03:30,000
and there's a way to fix that or work around

53
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:31,000
or something like that

54
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:34,000
but I've just returned my own script and then I'm going to use it.

55
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,300
You can use it as well. I've shown it in the previous tutorial.

56
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:45,700
All it does is bring the wireless interface down, change the mode to monitor mode

57
00:03:45,700 --> 00:03:47,800
and then change the state back up again.

58
00:03:47,800 --> 00:03:53,000
Here we can just see it one more time quickly.

59
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:54,000
Excellent

60
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,480
Perhaps I should add a MAC change here as well.

61
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:02,200
That would be actually a good idea, but for the time being I'm not going to do that

62
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:06,800
primarily because there is no need to hide, as I'm doing this to my own wireless system.

63
00:04:06,800 --> 00:04:08,769
However, if you're doing this outside

64
00:04:08,769 --> 00:04:13,800
definitely use "macchanger -r wlp2s0"

65
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:17,900
You can only change the MAC Address when the interface is down.

66
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,000
You cannot change the MAC address of the interface that is up.

67
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:24,170
How to do this I have shown in the previous tutorials as well.

68
00:04:24,170 --> 00:04:27,000
Anyway, let's just go ahead and clear the screen.

69
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:34,600
I usually run this command "airmon -ng check wlp2s0"

70
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:38,900
I use this not to set in monitor mode

71
00:04:38,900 --> 00:04:43,400
but rather instead, to perform a check up to see if there are any programs

72
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:47,900
any processes out there, within my computer, that might cause problems or interference.

73
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,600
Apparently there are none.

74
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,900
If there were, once you run this command

75
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:58,700
it would give you the PIDs of the processes and you would kill them easily, no problems there.

76
00:04:58,700 --> 00:05:00,300
Let's just go ahead and clear the screen

77
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:06,000
and tool that we need to use, as part of the aircrack package here, is aireplay.

78
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,700
So before we actually start doing that

79
00:05:08,700 --> 00:05:12,700
we will of course need to perform a scan with a tool that we have used previously.

80
00:05:12,700 --> 00:05:23,000
So "airdump -ng wlp2s0", press ENTER

81
00:05:23,000 --> 00:05:33,000
Oops, it's "airodump"

82
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,500
So apparently, I have some open access points here as well

83
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,000
and I have noticed a very strange thing.

84
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,300
When I perform these scans during different times of day, the signal strength varies

85
00:05:45,300 --> 00:05:49,500
and the amount of wireless access points also changes

86
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:52,000
I'm just gonna stop this because there are too many of them now.

87
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,500
The amount of wireless access points changes

88
00:05:56,500 --> 00:05:58,500
and the signal strength changes.

89
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:00,400
What I've noticed that people are doing

90
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,600
is that they actually turned their WiFis off during certain times of the day

91
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,000
when there are enough there or when they are not using it or something of a kind

92
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,500
and that is a very wise precaution.

93
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,300
I mean, that's a very intelligent thing to do

94
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:20,700
because if there is nobody your house, if there is nobody using WiFi

95
00:06:20,700 --> 00:06:23,800
there is literally no reason for you to leave it online.

96
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,920
Just pull the plug. Simple as that.

97
00:06:26,920 --> 00:06:32,580
You increase the safety of your home network exponentially

98
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:39,400
primarily because, not only are you permanently invisible during certain period of time

99
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:48,200
but you are also effectively limiting windows of opportunity for anybody to attack you

100
00:06:48,200 --> 00:06:52,200
and that can cause a ridiculous amount of problems to an attacker.

101
00:06:52,200 --> 00:06:57,120
Anyway, so over here I have my wireless interface.

102
00:06:57,120 --> 00:06:59,400
It's called "Something"

103
00:06:59,400 --> 00:07:03,900
It's on channel 6 and its power is relatively good

104
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:05,400
but look at my neighbors.

105
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:12,300
I conducted this scan last night and my own wireless was about 50 something

106
00:07:12,300 --> 00:07:16,200
and my neighbors was 59, which was ridiculous.

107
00:07:16,200 --> 00:07:21,000
I'm guessing this guy is right next to me or right below me

108
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:24,200
with an antenna attached to the ceiling or something of a kind.

109
00:07:24,200 --> 00:07:27,610
I have no idea, but he's getting a really strong wireless signal.

110
00:07:27,610 --> 00:07:34,900
I have to ask around to see who this is, just to see what the signal strength is on this router

111
00:07:34,900 --> 00:07:36,700
but anyway, it doesn't really matter.

112
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,200
Let's just use the aireplay.

113
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:47,500
However, I didn't find a way to actually specify a channel in aireplay.

114
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,200
Perhaps there is an option there or something of a kind, but it doesn't really matter.

115
00:07:51,200 --> 00:07:52,300
I didn't try too hard.

116
00:07:52,300 --> 00:07:56,000
What I want to show you is that you can actually change the channel

117
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:59,100
of your wireless internet network card manually.

118
00:07:59,100 --> 00:08:01,000
So just type in "iw..."

119
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,600
Wait, before we actually do that, let's just try random scan and see what happens.

120
00:08:04,600 --> 00:08:09,500
So "aireplay -ng"

121
00:08:09,500 --> 00:08:14,000
and here we're gonna need to specify "-0"

122
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:17,800
So "-0" is from the list of arguments

123
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:20,400
that I do believe that I showed previously, but it doesn't really matter.

124
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,400
So you see in help menu it says "--deauth"

125
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:25,600
You can use "-0" instead of that.

126
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,900
"--fake identification" you can use "-1" instead of that, and so on and so forth.

127
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:32,000
You don't actually to type in the whole command.

128
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,200
Rather instead, they've numerated them

129
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,600
so it's a lot easier to actually use.

130
00:08:38,600 --> 00:08:42,000
Anyway, "-0" ad space

131
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:43,200
It says "count"

132
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:47,700
So how many deauthentication requests do you want to send?

133
00:08:47,700 --> 00:08:49,700
You can specify a number

134
00:08:49,700 --> 00:08:51,900
It can be very large number here

135
00:08:51,900 --> 00:09:00,000
or you can just say "1" for single deauthentication, for capturing wpa2 handshakes.

136
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:02,700
Well, you're probably gonna need more than one, but doesn't really matter I usually have a

137
00:09:02,700 --> 00:09:05,300
I usually have the tendency to place a 0 here.

138
00:09:05,300 --> 00:09:08,200
0 tells it simply to do it continuously.

139
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:13,160
So you can just do it until you feel satisfied or until you achieve your purpose

140
00:09:13,160 --> 00:09:17,800
and then CTRL C to actually cancel it, no big deal there.

141
00:09:17,800 --> 00:09:26,000
Anyway, after that, we need to specify a "-a" option, which is the BSSID

142
00:09:26,000 --> 00:09:29,800
and then in addition to that, we need to specify an interface that we are going to be using.

143
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:31,400
Press ENTER, and there we go.

144
00:09:31,400 --> 00:09:36,000
So it says here on channel 3, but I know for a fact

145
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:43,300
and you can scroll up, you can see here it says "Something", it says "Channel 6"

146
00:09:43,300 --> 00:09:44,600
So this is not gonna work.

147
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:47,910
It says "No such BSSID available"

148
00:09:47,910 --> 00:09:50,000
"Please specify an ESSID"

149
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,500
So perhaps the name of the network.

150
00:09:53,500 --> 00:09:56,700
That is due to this channel problem

151
00:09:56,700 --> 00:09:58,500
So this is Channel 3

152
00:09:58,500 --> 00:10:05,600
and my wireless access point is actually functioning on Channel 6

153
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,400
while my wireless network card is functioning on Channel 3 in my laptop.

154
00:10:09,400 --> 00:10:14,200
What we need to do is manually configure the channel of our network card.

155
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:26,200
So "iwconfig wlp2s0 channel 6"

156
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:27,400
So it's very simple

157
00:10:27,400 --> 00:10:28,300
It's like English language

158
00:10:28,300 --> 00:10:32,000
You have a command, so "iwconfig"

159
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,200
The name of your wireless interface.

160
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,600
Just type in the argument that you want to change, which is "channel"

161
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:42,579
Same thing with mode, so just type in mod here and change it to whatever you want

162
00:10:42,579 --> 00:10:44,500
but in this case, we're changing the channels

163
00:10:44,500 --> 00:10:51,300
So just type in "channel", space, and then just type in the number of the channel you wish to change it to.

164
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:57,000
Anyway, now our wireless network card is operating on Channel 6

165
00:10:57,000 --> 00:11:00,500
and if we repeat the command that I have previously shown

166
00:11:00,500 --> 00:11:08,800
you will see immediately it actually passes.

167
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,300
Okay, so there is this message that we're being displayed here.

168
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:17,300
This is not an error message, this is just a note of a sort.

169
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:21,410
We can also deauthenticate individual clients on the network.

170
00:11:21,410 --> 00:11:23,800
You see, this attack that I am performing now

171
00:11:23,800 --> 00:11:29,800
this will deauthenticate everyone on that wireless access point.

172
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:31,889
Everybody will be deauthenticated.

173
00:11:31,889 --> 00:11:36,500
I mean, you can confirm this by using your smartphone or tablet

174
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:41,400
or another PC that is connected to your home wireless network

175
00:11:41,400 --> 00:11:45,000
and it might show the status that it is still connected

176
00:11:45,000 --> 00:11:47,000
but try browsing the net.

177
00:11:47,000 --> 00:11:49,600
Try opening a website or something of a kind.

178
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:55,200
You will never be able to do it, like not in a million years.

179
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:02,500
Also, there are some MAC filtering options that routers attempt to impose, but it doesn't matter

180
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:05,200
I have shown you how you can change a MAC address

181
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:11,500
and you can also set a script, which will rotate your MAC addresses periodically

182
00:12:11,500 --> 00:12:14,000
so that can be a nightmare.

183
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:21,200
Also, the routers have the option to adjust a certain range of MAC addresses, which can access it

184
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,000
but again, you will be able to see the deauthenticated clients on that network

185
00:12:25,000 --> 00:12:29,000
and just use their MAC addresses instead and pass through.

186
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,300
As I said, this is ridiculously difficult to stop

187
00:12:32,300 --> 00:12:38,100
and it's really painful when you're being DoS'ed, in terms of wireless

188
00:12:38,100 --> 00:12:41,000
There is very little that you can do.

189
00:12:41,000 --> 00:12:46,000
I honestly don't know of any known method to actually completely stop this

190
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:48,200
but we'll see.

191
00:12:48,200 --> 00:12:54,150
There are some enterprise type routers that are actually able to fight this off to an extent

192
00:12:54,150 --> 00:12:56,100
but we'll see what the future brings.

193
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,400
Anyway, I will be doing more of this in the follow-up tutorial

194
00:13:00,400 --> 00:13:03,700
and I will show you how you can deauthenticate a single client.

195
00:13:03,700 --> 00:13:06,500
Plus, you'll be writing down some bash scripts

196
00:13:06,500 --> 00:13:09,700
and see how that works out to improve our attack.

197
00:13:09,700 --> 00:13:11,800
In any case, I bid you farewell

198
00:13:11,800 --> 00:13:14,000
and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
