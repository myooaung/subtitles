00:00:00.910 --> 00:00:03.530

Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:04.870 --> 00:00:10.020

Today, I will open up a chapter
on attacking your home routers,



3

00:00:10.020 --> 00:00:13.730

and not only home routers but
routers in general.



4

00:00:13.730 --> 00:00:14.990

Why is this important?



5

00:00:14.990 --> 00:00:20.060

Well, routers are the first line of
defense for any major network out there.



6

00:00:20.060 --> 00:00:21.420

And if you can break into them,



7

00:00:21.420 --> 00:00:25.420

you can generally do pretty much
whatever you want on the network.



8

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:29.760

You can actually exclude people from
the firewall rules on the network and



9

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:32.260

access them directly as well.



10

00:00:32.260 --> 00:00:35.140

That can be a painful experience for
anyone on the other side.



11

00:00:35.140 --> 00:00:38.798

It can also change the DNS settings.



12

00:00:38.798 --> 00:00:45.300

You can set up proxies or something
of a kind, redirection of traffic.



13

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:50.300

You can serve them whatever
information you want because, for



14

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:56.360

all intents and purposes,
you are able to decide on what is what.



15

00:00:56.360 --> 00:01:01.120

So when a router requests a URL,
you can tell it it's on this IP address.



16

00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:02.400

Or it's on that IP address.



17

00:01:02.400 --> 00:01:03.310

Or you need to go here.



18

00:01:03.310 --> 00:01:06.950

Or you need to log in here before
you can go there, or whatever.



19

00:01:06.950 --> 00:01:09.400

It provides for all sorts of shenanigans.



20

00:01:09.400 --> 00:01:13.778

Now, before we begin, I would like you all
to go ahead and open up your web browser.



21

00:01:13.778 --> 00:01:18.498

You will need two websites,
nmap.org and Exploit Database.



22

00:01:18.498 --> 00:01:22.243

I have opened up both of
these websites before, but



23

00:01:22.243 --> 00:01:25.039

we haven't actually went over them.



24

00:01:25.039 --> 00:01:28.067

We haven't actually used
much from these websites,



25

00:01:28.067 --> 00:01:31.037

from all the vast resources
that they have to offer.



26

00:01:31.037 --> 00:01:37.473

And if you wish to follow this tutorial
through and do the things that I am doing,



27

00:01:37.473 --> 00:01:41.618

you will need to modify
your commands to an extent.



28

00:01:41.618 --> 00:01:45.981

And you will need to just pay attention at
what you are using, primarily because I



29

00:01:45.981 --> 00:01:49.830

have a router that is set up in my home
for the purposes of this tutorial,



30

00:01:49.830 --> 00:01:52.998

that I have configured for
the purposes of this tutorial.



31

00:01:52.998 --> 00:01:57.430

But your home routers
are likely to be different, and



32

00:01:57.430 --> 00:02:02.353

provided, of course,
that you own your own home router and



33

00:02:02.353 --> 00:02:07.098

that you legally can actually
do whatever you want to it.



34

00:02:07.098 --> 00:02:09.098

Because not all telecoms allow that.



35

00:02:09.098 --> 00:02:14.682

You can then feel free to play around
with it and see what you can do.



36

00:02:14.682 --> 00:02:18.901

You can lock it yourself,
know the password, but



37

00:02:18.901 --> 00:02:21.870

then you can try to break into it.



38

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:24.790

That's one of very good exercises.



39

00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:28.228

Sometimes, you won't be
able to break into it.



40

00:02:28.228 --> 00:02:32.635

There simply won't be any
vulnerabilities out there, and



41

00:02:32.635 --> 00:02:38.560

you won't have a suitable target for
social engineering or anything of a kind.



42

00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:43.170

But, more often than not, what you
are able to do is fool credentials from



43

00:02:44.500 --> 00:02:47.370

the router, without actual authentication.



44

00:02:47.370 --> 00:02:52.340

These are also some of the exploits that
usually are referred to by link traversal.



45

00:02:54.190 --> 00:02:58.600

And by modifying the URL requests of



46

00:02:58.600 --> 00:03:02.060

the web server of the router,
you are able to pool



47

00:03:03.110 --> 00:03:07.360

certain information from it which
ordinarily would not be available.



48

00:03:08.570 --> 00:03:12.130

Now, a key thing to mention here
is that it is a lot easier to



49

00:03:12.130 --> 00:03:15.290

break into the home routers
as opposed to breaking into



50

00:03:15.290 --> 00:03:19.000

the routers of bigger companies whose
networks are protected by such firewalls.



51

00:03:20.370 --> 00:03:23.398

Primarily because those routers, and
the companies, they are maintained.



52

00:03:23.398 --> 00:03:27.140

Somebody takes care of them, somebody
takes care of the updates, and so on and



53

00:03:27.140 --> 00:03:27.660

so forth.



54

00:03:27.660 --> 00:03:32.130

While, on the other hand, home routers, I
mean, how many, be honest with yourselves,



55

00:03:32.130 --> 00:03:36.880

again, and how many of you
actually conduct upgrades or



56

00:03:36.880 --> 00:03:39.160

firmware on your routers?



57

00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:40.460

And usually there's one exploit.



58

00:03:40.460 --> 00:03:42.940

If you don't update it,
it's gonna stick around there for



59

00:03:42.940 --> 00:03:44.460

a long line of years to come.



60

00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:50.950

Also, if you are wondering, why should
you attack home routers as opposed to



61

00:03:50.950 --> 00:03:57.930

attacking, for example, companies,
organizations, or something of a kind?



62

00:03:57.930 --> 00:04:02.010

Well, if you are providing a pen testing
service, and if you are attempting



63

00:04:02.010 --> 00:04:05.700

to prove that the network is vulnerable
of a certain company who has hired you,



64

00:04:05.700 --> 00:04:08.190

you might not be able
to attack it directly.



65

00:04:08.190 --> 00:04:13.830

But you might be able to attack
the employees' home routers,



66

00:04:13.830 --> 00:04:16.570

where you can actually gather
information on them, and



67

00:04:16.570 --> 00:04:19.990

later on utilize that
information in order to break



68

00:04:19.990 --> 00:04:24.310

into the routers on the main network
within the building of the company.



69

00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:28.590

Anyway, as I said,



70

00:04:28.590 --> 00:04:31.820

if you have permission from your home
router, feel free to play around with it.



71

00:04:31.820 --> 00:04:33.310

If not, then don't.



72

00:04:33.310 --> 00:04:35.832

Feel free to buy a router somewhere for



73

00:04:35.832 --> 00:04:40.480

20 bucks, something of a kind, and you
can set up a pretty decent lab at home.



74

00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:45.215

If you want to figure out what your
home router's IP is, as before,



75

00:04:45.215 --> 00:04:46.640

just type in route.



76

00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:49.668

And after route, nothing really,
just press Enter.



77

00:04:49.668 --> 00:04:51.428

You will get default Gateway.



78

00:04:51.428 --> 00:04:54.643

It's 192.168.1.1.



79

00:04:54.643 --> 00:05:00.300

If you go ahead and copy that,
I'm just gonna start nmap scan of it.



80

00:05:00.300 --> 00:05:03.440

Nmap and paste this.



81

00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.050

Give me forward boost output.



82

00:05:05.050 --> 00:05:09.470

So while it's doing that,
let's just go over to our browser, and



83

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.170

here I actually already have it up.



84

00:05:11.170 --> 00:05:12.800

Here I've tried it, if I just reload it.



85

00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:16.200

You see, it says here a username and



86

00:05:16.200 --> 00:05:19.070

password are being requested
at this IP address.



87

00:05:19.070 --> 00:05:20.920

The site says, and



88

00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.920

whoever made this router is a true genius,
because it immediately gives me the brand.



89

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:32.340

Not only the brand, but it actually
gives me the model number of the router.



90

00:05:32.340 --> 00:05:35.310

I mean, this is a technique
called banner grabbing.



91

00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:39.740

Or at least it falls into that category,
I would say.



92

00:05:41.750 --> 00:05:48.390

I can just see the model number here
in clear text, quite literally.



93

00:05:48.390 --> 00:05:49.140

And of course,



94

00:05:49.140 --> 00:05:54.070

when I know this, I don't need to perform
some complex nmap scans to figure it out.



95

00:05:54.070 --> 00:05:56.236

Rather instead, I can just do this,



96

00:05:56.236 --> 00:06:01.760

> Copy > Cancel, and
go over to the Exploit Database.



97

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:02.990

Click on Search.



98

00:06:02.990 --> 00:06:08.580

It says here, Free Text Search,
> CTRL+V > Search, and there we go.



99

00:06:08.580 --> 00:06:13.450

It says CSRF Vulnerability.



100

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:16.830

Let's see what this one has to offer.



101

00:06:16.830 --> 00:06:20.860

It says Introduction, TP-Link,
Description of Vulnerability.



102

00:06:21.930 --> 00:06:26.137

And look at the description,
you can easily change the default user's



103

00:06:26.137 --> 00:06:30.360

(admin) password by the default
router page listening on port 80.



104

00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:35.791

In here you the GET will change
the password for you and



105

00:06:35.791 --> 00:06:43.370

the POST request method is not needed for
changing the router pass.



106

00:06:43.370 --> 00:06:45.650

Excellent.
So, through a simple GET` request,



107

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:49.520

you can change the default admins
password, which is a bit ridiculous.



108

00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:53.770

And here is all the,
here is the exploit, and



109

00:06:53.770 --> 00:06:58.480

here is pretty much everything
that you need to do.



110

00:06:58.480 --> 00:06:59.150

That's it.



111

00:06:59.150 --> 00:07:00.860

Nothing, nothing else.



112

00:07:01.930 --> 00:07:07.300

Here, it's completely described in how
to implement it, and so on and so forth.



113

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:11.436

But, keep in mind,
that just because there's only one



114

00:07:11.436 --> 00:07:15.925

vulnerability with the exact
specific name of this router,



115

00:07:15.925 --> 00:07:22.103

that does not mean that that is the only
vulnerability that applies to that router.



116

00:07:22.103 --> 00:07:23.764

Always and always,
this is a good practice.



117

00:07:23.764 --> 00:07:28.945

Open up another window,
type in the model number and



118

00:07:28.945 --> 00:07:31.784

type in vulns, there we go.



119

00:07:31.784 --> 00:07:32.843

Press Enter.



120

00:07:36.646 --> 00:07:40.372

So okay, I have



121

00:07:40.372 --> 00:07:45.248

CSRF Vulnerability



122

00:07:45.248 --> 00:07:49.549

listed here, but



123

00:07:49.549 --> 00:07:54.147

lets see this one.



124

00:07:54.147 --> 00:07:56.626

What do we got here?



125

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:02.640

Excellent.



126

00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:04.520

So here is another one.



127

00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:08.233

It says Default Admin Credentials,
web interface default, if you request,



128

00:08:08.233 --> 00:08:08.860

there we go.



129

00:08:11.750 --> 00:08:14.530

So this is, again, a modified URL request.



130

00:08:14.530 --> 00:08:15.150

Let me just show you what I mean.



131

00:08:15.150 --> 00:08:20.324

I would, of course,
do this in a different manner, but for



132

00:08:20.324 --> 00:08:27.169

the purpose of this tutorial,
I'm just gonna do this manually, /rom-0.



133

00:08:27.169 --> 00:08:33.428

Because I'm a genius who typed a dot.



134

00:08:36.227 --> 00:08:40.750

Excellent, so it says problem
loading the page, unable to load it.



135

00:08:40.750 --> 00:08:42.820

But, see what I got.



136

00:08:42.820 --> 00:08:48.510

I am able to download the rom-0 file and
save it to my computer.



137

00:08:48.510 --> 00:08:53.185

From that point on, I just need a program
which would read through it and interpret



138

00:08:53.185 --> 00:08:57.980

it for me to be able to read it and get
the pass and get the credentials from it.



139

00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:01.750

I will demonstrate this in the follow-up
tutorial, but for the time being,



140

00:09:01.750 --> 00:09:06.980

I just wanted to show you how you
can banner grab, and then search.



141

00:09:06.980 --> 00:09:08.840

And the places that you should search.



142

00:09:08.840 --> 00:09:09.760

You see, it's not actually listed here.



143

00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:12.485

It's probably listed under
a different router name.



144

00:09:12.485 --> 00:09:17.300

Probably just tp link td,
but it doesn't matter.



145

00:09:17.300 --> 00:09:21.490

So, in the follow-up tutorial, I will show
you how we can break into this router of



146

00:09:21.490 --> 00:09:26.307

mine, that I have set up for
this tutorial, by utilizing the rom-0



147

00:09:26.307 --> 00:09:31.820

download runnability, let's call it so,
and actually reading from it.



148

00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.110

We're gonna need some tools here in
order to be able to interpret it.



149

00:09:36.110 --> 00:09:39.780

In any case, I bid you farewell, and
I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
