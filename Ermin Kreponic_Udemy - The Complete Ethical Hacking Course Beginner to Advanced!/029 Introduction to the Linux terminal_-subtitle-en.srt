00:00:00,250 --> 00:00:02,700
Hello everybody and welcome to this
tutorial.

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,600
Today I will introduce you to the Linux terminal

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:08,900
and show you some of its basic
functionalities so

4
00:00:08,900 --> 00:00:15,600
So in Kali Linux, the terminal icon is located in the upper left corner

5
00:00:15,600 --> 00:00:16,500
this black thing

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:17,710
So just click on it

7
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:18,900
and there you go.

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,200
You have the terminal up and running here by default

9
00:00:22,200 --> 00:00:26,000
It opens up a root terminal in Kali

10
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:27,400
So if you want to

11
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:29,210
usually people want to configure it

12
00:00:29,210 --> 00:00:32,300
but if you don't want to configure anything else

13
00:00:32,300 --> 00:00:33,500
this is perfectly fine.

14
00:00:33,500 --> 00:00:35,290
You don't actually need to do anything else.

15
00:00:35,290 --> 00:00:41,700
However, 99% of time people will configure the terminal

16
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:44,879
to suit their own needs and purposes.

17
00:00:44,880 --> 00:00:50,100
For example, I will always almost always increase the font size.

18
00:00:50,100 --> 00:00:51,900
So that it's clear and visible

19
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:55,829
and that I have a better overview of what I am doing at the moment

20
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:00,320
and it also reduces eyestrain, according
to some articles

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:06,200
Anyway, just go ahead and right click anywhere on the terminal itself

22
00:01:06,200 --> 00:01:09,000
not on the bar, but on the terminal itself

23
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,619
and then you have "show menu bar"

24
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:12,400
Now we can see it here

25
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:14,700
Go ahead and click on edit

26
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:16,400
You can click on profiles as well

27
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:21,000
and create new profiles here by just clicking on "New"

28
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,300
giving it a name and then configuring it in the preferences.

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,400
However, we're gonna be configuring the default profile

30
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,900
since there really is no need to create any additional ones.

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:36,280
Go ahead and click on profile preferences

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:39,829
and here you have a great deal of options.

33
00:01:41,500 --> 00:01:43,290
One of the first ones you will see

34
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,409
is that you can use a system fixed with
font.

35
00:01:47,409 --> 00:01:49,800
So this is not good.

36
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:51,300
You see this is very small

37
00:01:51,300 --> 00:01:53,350
I always need to change that.

38
00:01:53,350 --> 00:01:55,619
If that's fine for you, you can keep it like that

39
00:01:55,620 --> 00:01:57,100
but I always change it.

40
00:01:57,100 --> 00:01:59,250
I have monospace 20

41
00:01:59,250 --> 00:02:03,500
If you click on it, you can change the
font size here if you wish.

42
00:02:03,500 --> 00:02:06,049
You can change the font that you're using

43
00:02:06,049 --> 00:02:10,500
and that would be it as far as this place is concerned.

44
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:14,200
You has some other very simple options here

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,100
It says "show menu bar by default in new terminals"

46
00:02:17,100 --> 00:02:20,290
I generally take it.

47
00:02:20,290 --> 00:02:22,100
I think it's a good idea

48
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:25,800
since you always need to do something like open up a tab

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:27,200
or something of a kind

50
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:28,740
but you don't need to

51
00:02:28,740 --> 00:02:30,400
You have the cursor shape here.

52
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,300
It says "Block" "I-Beam" "Underline

53
00:02:32,300 --> 00:02:33,700
I just want to show you how it looks like.

54
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:36,400
You can view the terminal as the changes are applied.

55
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,290
So you have a block and you have a underline.

56
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:39,500
I prefer a block

57
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:41,000
You can use whatever you wish.

58
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:45,420
It will not affect you in any technical
sense, that is.

59
00:02:45,420 --> 00:02:49,920
I have "Title and Command' and we don't actually change anything there.

60
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,000
You can change the title if you wish

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,510
and we have colors.

62
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:59,800
So I think that this color scheme is appropriate and fitting for me

63
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:02,300
but you can change it anyway you like.

64
00:03:02,300 --> 00:03:05,500
You can customize it to the point of extreme.

65
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:06,900
You can change the text color.

66
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:08,140
The background color.

67
00:03:08,140 --> 00:03:11,000
You have the color palette here.

68
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:13,100
So you can do whatever you want here.

69
00:03:13,100 --> 00:03:15,000
You have built-in schemes.

70
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:16,700
It says White on Black

71
00:03:16,700 --> 00:03:19,190
I can say Green on Black

72
00:03:19,190 --> 00:03:22,000
Oops, sorry...cancel

73
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,000
You can say Green on Black

74
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:26,900
Does it have Blue on Black?

75
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:28,000
Umm, no.

76
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,200
Oh, this one's bad

77
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:30,940
I wouldn't be able to work on this one.

78
00:03:30,940 --> 00:03:37,000
So let's just leave it at White on Black.

79
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:38,500
This is the best color...

80
00:03:38,500 --> 00:03:41,300
This is one of the best color schemes I use.

81
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,800
Personally, I use on Fedora Blue on Black

82
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,000
but I'm just gonna leave it as it is here.

83
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,870
No need to actually change anything.

84
00:03:47,870 --> 00:03:52,090
Now in the background, you have three features here basically

85
00:03:52,090 --> 00:03:55,470
You have solid color like this one here that you are seeing

86
00:03:55,470 --> 00:03:58,959
and you can choose a background image.

87
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,080
You can download anything you want from the internet pretty much.

88
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:05,080
You can configure it to be transparent

89
00:04:05,080 --> 00:04:08,000
or image background.

90
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:14,700
and also, you have the ability to have a fully transparent background

91
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,500
and if you click on "Transparent Background"

92
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:19,380
it's pretty much the same as having a background image

93
00:04:19,380 --> 00:04:22,500
except in this case

94
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,000
excellent

95
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:25,100
I'm just gonna configure the transparency levels

96
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:26,100
and that's pretty good

97
00:04:26,100 --> 00:04:27,800
except in this case

98
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,900
your background image will be your desktop image pretty much

99
00:04:31,900 --> 00:04:35,100
depending on where your terminal is.

100
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,600
in "Scrolling", there's an important
feature here

101
00:04:38,600 --> 00:04:39,800
It's "Scroll Back"

102
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,400
So you don't want to have 512 lines.

103
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:46,000
You want to go ahead and click on "Unlimited"

104
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:48,710
unless you're severely limited in terms of RAM

105
00:04:48,710 --> 00:04:52,420
and unless you're typing in a large amount of commands

106
00:04:52,420 --> 00:04:53,500
or something of a kind

107
00:04:53,500 --> 00:04:55,990
but in any case, it's better to have unlimited

108
00:04:55,990 --> 00:05:00,600
especially not only environment such as these

109
00:05:00,600 --> 00:05:01,560
but rather instead

110
00:05:01,560 --> 00:05:03,700
in cases such as these.

111
00:05:03,700 --> 00:05:07,080
You don't need to do anything here in terms of compatibility.

112
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:09,100
I'm just gonna go ahead and close this

113
00:05:09,100 --> 00:05:11,900
and I have selected a transparent background

114
00:05:11,900 --> 00:05:14,160
and you see this only works for a desktop image.

115
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,000
It doesn't actually show icons or anything of the kind.

116
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:21,000
If I open up my web browser, it's not gonna show it in the background.

117
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:25,400
It's still gonna keep the desktop background image.

118
00:05:25,400 --> 00:05:29,000
So the desktop wallpaper, should you wish to call it so.

119
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,300
There's a slight delay when it goes about in the update

120
00:05:32,300 --> 00:05:33,900
but it's fine.

121
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,700
Doesn't bother us in this slightest bit.

122
00:05:35,700 --> 00:05:38,099
Maybe I will change this later on during tutorial

123
00:05:38,099 --> 00:05:40,400
see how I like it

124
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:46,300
but I just wanted to give you an option, so you can do whatever you want with it.

125
00:05:46,300 --> 00:05:49,539
In any case, you can go ahead and click on "File"

126
00:05:49,539 --> 00:05:51,500
and "Open Tab"

127
00:05:51,500 --> 00:05:55,300
I'm just gonna go ahead open myself four tabs

128
00:05:55,300 --> 00:05:57,860
three new ones and one I already had.

129
00:05:57,860 --> 00:06:01,000
So here you can switch in between them.

130
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,099
It's very nice.

131
00:06:02,099 --> 00:06:04,500
There are no complications.

132
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:07,300
For example, if I press "Open up a new terminal"

133
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:09,760
I gotta click here and then I gotta click here

134
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,400
and unusually you're gonna have...

135
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:14,199
I'm just wanna show you what it's like to have four of them.

136
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,300
So yeah, this is not actually manageable

137
00:06:18,300 --> 00:06:24,000
especially because you don't know what you are doing on which terminal.

138
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,099
People sometimes split their screens into terminals.

139
00:06:27,099 --> 00:06:28,600
I sometimes do that

140
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,300
It's very nice

141
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:33,400
but we will deal with that a bit later on when we get into some serious stuff.

142
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:35,880
When we actually need multiple terminals

143
00:06:35,890 --> 00:06:40,100
but tabbing these terminals

144
00:06:40,100 --> 00:06:41,500
it's very nice

145
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:44,240
primarily because you can actually see what you're doing

146
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:46,000
on each one of them in the headers.

147
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,630
See these things that I'm clicking on now

148
00:06:48,630 --> 00:06:51,000
They are headers of the terminal

149
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:52,420
or so you can call them

150
00:06:52,420 --> 00:06:54,500
and for example, in this terminal

151
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:55,950
I'm gonna go ahead and say

152
00:06:55,950 --> 00:06:59,240
"I want you to go into home. Change the
directory to home"

153
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:01,900
Change the working directory, that is

154
00:07:01,900 --> 00:07:04,000
If I change it here to "var"

155
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,850
and if I change it here to "var/logs"

156
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:14,870
and if I want to go here to "tmp folder"

157
00:07:14,870 --> 00:07:16,000
Excellent

158
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,400
So on each of the tabs in the headers

159
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:21,360
I can see where I am.

160
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,700
So this this one, it's home

161
00:07:23,700 --> 00:07:25,500
but this one, it's tmp.

162
00:07:25,500 --> 00:07:27,200
I don't need to click on it to know.

163
00:07:27,200 --> 00:07:28,700
This one is log.

164
00:07:28,700 --> 00:07:32,000
So I can know what I'm doing in every particular terminal

165
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:33,600
and even though you could have a program running

166
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:34,500
or something like that

167
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,000
It's still gonna write it out in the header

168
00:07:37,000 --> 00:07:39,800
and you're gonna get some extra information there.

169
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:40,300
It's very nice

170
00:07:40,300 --> 00:07:41,310
It's very useful

171
00:07:41,310 --> 00:07:46,490
and it's going to help you out a lot as we progress through this course

172
00:07:46,490 --> 00:07:49,500
and as we get into more complicated
stuff.

173
00:07:49,500 --> 00:07:52,260
Anyway, I just want to introduce you to the next terminal.

174
00:07:52,260 --> 00:07:54,300
We have done some work with before

175
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:58,850
during the installation of VirtualBox and VirtualBox guest additions

176
00:07:58,850 --> 00:08:01,500
but basically there, I just give you the
command

177
00:08:01,500 --> 00:08:06,160
and you're gonna basically just rewrite it or copy-paste it

178
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:08,000
and that's gonna be it.

179
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:10,700
but here, in the follow-up tutorial

180
00:08:10,700 --> 00:08:16,400
actually I will start explaining the fundamental Linux terminal commands

181
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:17,590
The most common ones

182
00:08:17,590 --> 00:08:18,900
The most basic ones

183
00:08:18,900 --> 00:08:22,100
and there you will be able to see the logic of things

184
00:08:22,100 --> 00:08:25,100
and how this Linux terminal works and functions

185
00:08:25,100 --> 00:08:26,890
because once you actually learn that

186
00:08:26,890 --> 00:08:30,330
it gives you a huge amount of power.

187
00:08:30,330 --> 00:08:35,500
All the power of the operating system rests on it's terminal

188
00:08:35,500 --> 00:08:38,400
because it's a direct interface to the kernel of the system

189
00:08:38,410 --> 00:08:43,000
and it's a lot faster then the graphical interface.

190
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:45,810
Now one more keynote that I would like to make here

191
00:08:45,810 --> 00:08:49,900
Once I teach you how to use the Linux terminal

192
00:08:49,900 --> 00:08:53,430
and once you get into the habit of typing in commands

193
00:08:53,430 --> 00:08:57,000
you can use them for a wide variety of
purposes.

194
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,000
You don't necessarily need to use these things for pen testing

195
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,100
or something like that.

196
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,060
You can use these commands for network administration

197
00:09:05,060 --> 00:09:09,280
or you can use them in order to troubleshoot problems with the system

198
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,800
and so on and so forth.

199
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:15,900
So you get a far wider spectrum options in terms of jobs

200
00:09:15,900 --> 00:09:17,310
or something of a kind

201
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:22,300
as opposed to just learning something
that you can only use for pen testing

202
00:09:22,300 --> 00:09:23,880
and nothing else.

203
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:27,500
In any case, I bid you farewell

204
00:09:27,500 --> 00:09:31,080
and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
