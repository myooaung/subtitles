1
00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:06,104
Okay, so the fix was amazingly simple.

2
00:00:06,339 --> 00:00:10,126
I basically figured it out
the moment I stopped it.

3
00:00:13,103 --> 00:00:15,334
I will share it with you because you need to know

4
00:00:15,569 --> 00:00:17,778
and this will block you as well most likely.

5
00:00:18,737 --> 00:00:22,397
So first of all, you see
the icon in the upper right corner

6
00:00:22,632 --> 00:00:24,774
the one that I'm pointing with my mouse now

7
00:00:24,909 --> 00:00:28,176
the one that is lit up, the wireless symbol,

8
00:00:28,411 --> 00:00:32,190
not of my Mac but of this
virtual machine, it needs to look like this.

9
00:00:33,407 --> 00:00:36,140
Why didn't it work?
as you can see, it's working now

10
00:00:36,375 --> 00:00:40,117
so if I type in "ping google.com"

11
00:00:41,924 --> 00:00:43,478
the pings are passing through,

12
00:00:43,613 --> 00:00:45,669
and if you think that I did
some shenanigans with the network,

13
00:00:45,704 --> 00:00:50,679
I did not touch it, you see the network status

14
00:00:50,714 --> 00:00:54,116
is still not attached at all, I didn't touch this.

15
00:00:57,123 --> 00:00:59,066
What happened here is pretty much

16
00:01:00,788 --> 00:01:02,790
what does happen sometimes when I switch

17
00:01:03,685 --> 00:01:05,799
from my wired to wireless connection.

18
00:01:07,882 --> 00:01:11,130
It basically keeps on using the wired interface

19
00:01:11,265 --> 00:01:13,620
even though there is no connection on it

20
00:01:14,055 --> 00:01:18,260
and it doesn't know that I've
disconnected it or something like that.

21
00:01:19,294 --> 00:01:21,045
It still sticks to the IP there

22
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:23,204
and it attempts to send
packets through that interface

23
00:01:23,339 --> 00:01:26,221
but it simply cannot, it's not possible.

24
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:29,629
Therefore, what you need to do is the following:

25
00:01:30,754 --> 00:01:36,002
Just clear the screen and type in "ifconfig eth0".

26
00:01:37,687 --> 00:01:39,769
You see, this is the Ethernet interface

27
00:01:39,904 --> 00:01:44,032
and you need to type in "ifconfig eth0 down".

28
00:01:45,544 --> 00:01:49,687
And then you need to
basically type this command in,

29
00:01:49,922 --> 00:01:51,879
where do I have it? There we go,

30
00:01:52,014 --> 00:01:56,505
so "systemctl restart network-manager", Enter.

31
00:01:58,085 --> 00:01:59,808
It just restarted, that's all you need to do,

32
00:02:01,344 --> 00:02:04,236
and I can type in "ifconfig" again.

33
00:02:05,934 --> 00:02:08,347
The interface is back up

34
00:02:09,891 --> 00:02:13,990
but, you see, that it does
not have an IPv4 address at all,

35
00:02:14,125 --> 00:02:16,645
there is no IPv4 address here,

36
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:19,773
rather instead, the IPv4 address is here,

37
00:02:20,008 --> 00:02:24,071
as you can see, it's 192.158.1.10.

38
00:02:24,206 --> 00:02:27,739
And there you have it,
it's there, it's functioning, I can use it.

39
00:02:27,774 --> 00:02:31,551
So if I type in "ping google.com" again

40
00:02:31,686 --> 00:02:35,351
it works, it's passing through, I'm gonna stop it

41
00:02:35,486 --> 00:02:37,875
and let's try to open up Udemy one more time.

42
00:02:40,378 --> 00:02:44,551
There we go, I'm not using
my Mac connection at all here.

43
00:02:44,686 --> 00:02:48,768
I can actually turn the Wi-Fi off on my Mac and

44
00:02:50,367 --> 00:02:53,633
I am still going to be able to do this.

45
00:02:53,868 --> 00:02:55,815
Let me open Udemy Facebook.

46
00:02:58,384 --> 00:03:01,467
It's gonna open it up, maybe
it's gonna be a bit tardy, a bit slow

47
00:03:01,702 --> 00:03:06,018
but it's a virtual machine, so... forgive it.

48
00:03:07,667 --> 00:03:09,784
There you go, I mean, it will open the site,

49
00:03:09,919 --> 00:03:12,203
it's just a little bit slow,
but there you go. It's open.

50
00:03:12,438 --> 00:03:14,910
I just wanted to demonstrate even though

51
00:03:15,045 --> 00:03:17,354
my Wi-Fi is off on my MacBook Pro

52
00:03:18,357 --> 00:03:22,969
and I don't have any connection now,
I'm gonna turn it back on,

53
00:03:24,425 --> 00:03:26,742
but that's it. So look,

54
00:03:26,977 --> 00:03:31,678
this is the very first time in my entire life

55
00:03:31,813 --> 00:03:35,146
I mean, literally, in my
entire life, that I've used the Mac.

56
00:03:35,181 --> 00:03:39,783
Sure I come from a long background of Linux,

57
00:03:39,918 --> 00:03:43,694
and I have used it extensively
and I have suffered with it extensively

58
00:03:43,829 --> 00:03:47,607
until I've learned it. But this, for me,

59
00:03:47,642 --> 00:03:49,975
is the very first time that I've used the Mac.

60
00:03:50,110 --> 00:03:52,184
Sure the Linux does give
me a little bit of an advantage

61
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:55,289
to a Windows user, but still, keep in mind

62
00:03:55,624 --> 00:03:59,205
this is the very first time that
I've used the Mac in my entire life.

63
00:04:00,487 --> 00:04:03,177
And I have managed to get this to work.

64
00:04:04,470 --> 00:04:08,358
This was the first try,
in front of everybody, live as you saw.

65
00:04:08,393 --> 00:04:11,990
I encountered stupid
problems, I encountered stupid errors,

66
00:04:15,025 --> 00:04:17,026
none of them were too complicated or complex,

67
00:04:17,261 --> 00:04:18,905
but they were just kind of stupid, I mean,

68
00:04:18,848 --> 00:04:23,543
I didn't know how to
unzip a file on a Mac, basically.

69
00:04:23,978 --> 00:04:29,209
It was that stupid, so I went onto
the net and I researched for Homebrew

70
00:04:29,344 --> 00:04:31,323
and I figured out that there was something called

71
00:04:31,358 --> 00:04:33,102
Homebrew and there is Macports

72
00:04:33,337 --> 00:04:37,949
and I've researched extensively on
Stack Overflow, on Buffer Overflow,

73
00:04:37,984 --> 00:04:39,554
actually, Stack Overflow.

74
00:04:40,853 --> 00:04:43,802
I've looked through the Apple's
forums, I've looked everywhere

75
00:04:43,937 --> 00:04:46,052
and I figured out where they're safe or not

76
00:04:46,287 --> 00:04:48,283
and then I went through all of these installations.

77
00:04:48,418 --> 00:04:50,540
As you can see, they were kind of slow,

78
00:04:50,775 --> 00:04:54,164
I wasn't sure what I was doing, I was inching

79
00:04:55,265 --> 00:04:57,642
and moving and figuring it out together with you

80
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:02,071
and I wanted to do it this way
because this puts me in your shoes,

81
00:05:02,206 --> 00:05:05,703
this puts me in the shoes of
somebody who has experienced problems

82
00:05:05,938 --> 00:05:10,261
and basically, like this I can
do it from your perspective

83
00:05:10,396 --> 00:05:15,108
and you see it does work.
There's no need to install anything on a Mac,

84
00:05:15,443 --> 00:05:19,454
you don't need any
additional drivers on it. Nothing.

85
00:05:19,589 --> 00:05:21,926
You just need to download
the extensions for VirtualBox,

86
00:05:22,061 --> 00:05:25,059
that's it, plug a USB in. Your Mac won't see it,

87
00:05:25,194 --> 00:05:26,818
you won't be able to use it on your Mac,

88
00:05:26,853 --> 00:05:28,556
if you want to use it on your Mac, you can go

89
00:05:28,962 --> 00:05:31,375
and download the drivers
for it if you really want it,

90
00:05:31,995 --> 00:05:33,761
but there's no point to use it on a Mac.

91
00:05:33,796 --> 00:05:36,743
I mean, you already have a wireless card on a Mac.

92
00:05:38,012 --> 00:05:41,282
And I just downloaded the
extensions from Oracle VirtualBox,

93
00:05:41,517 --> 00:05:46,134
plug the USB in, there was no activity on it

94
00:05:46,269 --> 00:05:50,952
until I booted up the Kali Linux
virtual machine to control the USB

95
00:05:51,723 --> 00:05:55,623
and I was able to utilize it here in the VM.

96
00:05:55,758 --> 00:05:57,732
First try,

97
00:05:58,901 --> 00:06:02,108
things were hairy, but I've
managed to go through it all

98
00:06:02,443 --> 00:06:05,690
and managed to set it up
without any problems of whatsoever.

99
00:06:05,925 --> 00:06:10,787
So this is a proof that it works
in a Mac without any problems,

100
00:06:10,822 --> 00:06:13,921
this is Yosemite, latest updates,

101
00:06:15,253 --> 00:06:17,402
sure the Mac is a little bit old, it's from 2011,

102
00:06:17,737 --> 00:06:20,457
but it's running Yosemite on latest updates

103
00:06:23,546 --> 00:06:27,207
and basicaly there is not that
much difference from Mac from 2015.

104
00:06:27,342 --> 00:06:31,414
Sure you have a better display,
but that doesn't affect your USB.

105
00:06:33,128 --> 00:06:35,029
You have a bit of a different hardware inside,

106
00:06:35,164 --> 00:06:38,118
again, doesn't affect your USB port pass-through.

107
00:06:40,390 --> 00:06:44,431
That's pretty much the same,
maybe the only thing that can be different

108
00:06:44,566 --> 00:06:47,327
from this Mac and from
one of 2015 is that that one

109
00:06:47,462 --> 00:06:51,533
that was produced in 2015
will be a lot faster than this one,

110
00:06:51,668 --> 00:06:55,468
perhaps due to flash
storage, perhaps a better processor,

111
00:06:56,942 --> 00:06:58,700
a better RAM and so on and so forth.

112
00:07:01,651 --> 00:07:04,433
If you have any questions,
if you get stuck anywhere along the way

113
00:07:05,876 --> 00:07:07,999
you are, of course, free to post your questions

114
00:07:08,134 --> 00:07:12,103
in the discussion section and I,
as always, will be more than happy

115
00:07:12,138 --> 00:07:15,958
to help you all out as much as I can, but

116
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:18,930
the very first thing that I would advise you to do

117
00:07:19,065 --> 00:07:23,045
is to actually just take a deep breath,

118
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,846
walk away from your computer, come back,

119
00:07:25,981 --> 00:07:29,012
take a look at the lecture one more time,

120
00:07:30,173 --> 00:07:34,360
slowly, see what I've done,
I haven't skipped any of the steps.

121
00:07:34,395 --> 00:07:36,171
At least, I hope that I didn't.

122
00:07:37,279 --> 00:07:39,990
And try to redo the process.

123
00:07:41,259 --> 00:07:44,565
Also, there are many forums that are your friends.

124
00:07:44,700 --> 00:07:47,085
You can go to Apple forums, you can

125
00:07:47,320 --> 00:07:52,296
go to Linux forums, one of the
Linux forums that I would recommend is

126
00:07:52,331 --> 00:07:54,981
linux.org/linuxquestions

127
00:07:57,913 --> 00:07:59,875
and then you can go to Stack Overflow as well,

128
00:08:01,306 --> 00:08:03,474
they have some really nice sections there as well.

129
00:08:03,509 --> 00:08:08,128
Anyway, I really hope that
this has helped you out a ton

130
00:08:08,263 --> 00:08:11,557
and that you have
managed to get it to work on a Mac.

131
00:08:11,792 --> 00:08:14,911
As you can see, it's not really that much different

132
00:08:15,246 --> 00:08:18,267
from a Windows installation
or from a Linux installation.

133
00:08:18,502 --> 00:08:20,798
It's a little bit different
from a Linux installation

134
00:08:20,933 --> 00:08:24,337
but it's not that different
from a Windows installation at all

135
00:08:24,372 --> 00:08:28,500
and I have chosen the simplest
possible way of installing a Kali VM

136
00:08:29,954 --> 00:08:33,078
within a Mac, so I didn't even
perform the installation with an ISO.

137
00:08:33,213 --> 00:08:36,815
I just downloaded a
prepacked version for VirtualBox

138
00:08:36,950 --> 00:08:39,854
so that you wouldn't have
to bother with any of those things.

139
00:08:40,089 --> 00:08:41,671
I bid you all farewell

140
00:08:41,806 --> 00:08:44,968
and let me know in the
discussions what you think of this,

141
00:08:45,103 --> 00:08:49,416
was this helpful and would you
like to see more videos in regard to Mac,

142
00:08:49,451 --> 00:08:51,677
and what sort of videos
would you like to see with Mac.

143
00:08:51,812 --> 00:08:53,778
Anything that's doable or makes sense,

144
00:08:54,213 --> 00:08:57,705
I will take into
consideration and perhaps try to do.

145
00:08:57,840 --> 00:09:00,294
Till then, I bid you farewell.
