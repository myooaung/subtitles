1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,067
Okay, so welcome back everybody.

2
00:00:02,102 --> 00:00:05,199
Now we're gonna have to do a few things

3
00:00:05,434 --> 00:00:07,800
in order to get this sorted and working.

4
00:00:08,235 --> 00:00:12,574
You might notice that
the unetbootin is no longer running.

5
00:00:12,709 --> 00:00:16,238
At the end of the
installation process I pressed on Exit

6
00:00:17,426 --> 00:00:20,942
but I did take a screenshot,
so this is what you will get.

7
00:00:22,520 --> 00:00:25,394
Hold on. There you go.

8
00:00:25,429 --> 00:00:28,215
So, lots of things here in the background:

9
00:00:28,250 --> 00:00:32,000
forums, I am running through things,

10
00:00:32,135 --> 00:00:34,718
downloading things, going insane, berserk.

11
00:00:34,853 --> 00:00:39,083
But no big deal, here it says
"downloading", "extracting",

12
00:00:39,218 --> 00:00:42,321
"installing", "installation complete".
And down below, look, it says...

13
00:00:43,694 --> 00:00:45,825
Actually this is a screenshot
from the previous attempts,

14
00:00:46,933 --> 00:00:50,376
doesn't really matter, you're
going to get the same exact message.

15
00:00:51,998 --> 00:00:53,532
This is the point, the moral of the story.

16
00:00:53,667 --> 00:00:56,842
It will say that the created
USB device will not boot off of a Mac.

17
00:00:56,897 --> 00:01:01,313
"Insert it into a PC and select
the USB boot option in the BIOS boot menu."

18
00:01:01,448 --> 00:01:03,431
So this is true, this is completely true.

19
00:01:03,466 --> 00:01:06,804
The unetbootin has told you that this USB will not,

20
00:01:07,039 --> 00:01:10,520
I mean, will not work on
a Mac and it doesn't matter which

21
00:01:11,260 --> 00:01:13,535
is a 2013, 14, 15,

22
00:01:13,570 --> 00:01:16,290
or 2009, 10, 11, whatever.

23
00:01:16,325 --> 00:01:20,650
Completely irrelevant.
This USB will not work as it is.

24
00:01:20,785 --> 00:01:23,448
We need to modify it,
we need to play around with it

25
00:01:23,583 --> 00:01:25,092
in order to make it functional.

26
00:01:25,776 --> 00:01:28,293
Let's go ahead and close
this image, as we no longer need it

27
00:01:28,428 --> 00:01:33,279
and let's open up our file
manager, Finder, as it is called on Mac

28
00:01:33,614 --> 00:01:37,934
and go to the partition
that we have just modified.

29
00:01:39,519 --> 00:01:42,756
This Efi folder, I've created it a moment ago

30
00:01:42,891 --> 00:01:45,676
when I was attempting to
do this video but failed miserably.

31
00:01:45,911 --> 00:01:48,360
I'm gonna go ahead and say "move to Trash".

32
00:01:48,495 --> 00:01:50,485
You're not gonna have it in the first place,

33
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:53,474
so I have removed it completely.

34
00:01:54,438 --> 00:01:57,449
What I need to do now is go ahead and say

35
00:01:57,584 --> 00:02:01,054
new folder, type in "Efi", Enter.

36
00:02:02,088 --> 00:02:04,633
And then I need to enter Efi and

37
00:02:06,488 --> 00:02:09,526
go into new folder and type in "Boot",

38
00:02:10,632 --> 00:02:12,411
and then I'm gonna go into Boot.

39
00:02:12,446 --> 00:02:15,086
Well, actually, I didn't need to go into Boot.

40
00:02:16,617 --> 00:02:19,561
That's it, that's what you need
to do. Just create those folders.

41
00:02:22,385 --> 00:02:25,218
It goes like this. This is
the folder tray that you need,

42
00:02:25,253 --> 00:02:28,030
so Efi and then Boot. In the root.

43
00:02:28,065 --> 00:02:30,924
So in the root of the USB, on the first partition,

44
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:32,915
which we have created, for me it's Untitled 1,

45
00:02:33,050 --> 00:02:35,085
you might have labelled
it differently, doesn't matter.

46
00:02:35,320 --> 00:02:38,769
As I said, you have
freedom there, it does not affect it.

47
00:02:38,804 --> 00:02:42,442
It does not affect it in a technical
sense, the boot process, that much.

48
00:02:42,477 --> 00:02:44,895
It's gonna boot whether it's called Tralala

49
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,404
or whether it's called
Untitled 1, completely irrelevant.

50
00:02:48,804 --> 00:02:51,874
It says here "Efi" and then here "Boot".

51
00:02:51,909 --> 00:02:54,295
This, you need to create.
Without this it will not work.

52
00:02:55,714 --> 00:02:58,890
The following files that
I will copy into the Boot folder

53
00:02:58,925 --> 00:03:02,982
will be provided to you either
on Udemy or links for downloads

54
00:03:03,117 --> 00:03:05,752
will be provided for them on Udemy,

55
00:03:05,887 --> 00:03:08,284
so you'll be able to download them from the net.

56
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,421
I'm just gonna go ahead and
copy them from my other USB.

57
00:03:14,201 --> 00:03:17,148
There you go, so you need bootX64.efi,

58
00:03:17,383 --> 00:03:22,637
grub.cfg, grubx64.efi, MokManager.efi.

59
00:03:24,004 --> 00:03:27,889
One of these four is going
to work, the other ones will be pointless.

60
00:03:29,210 --> 00:03:32,571
Well, not pointless, but you
won't be able to boot from them,

61
00:03:32,906 --> 00:03:34,883
you won't be able to use them to boot,

62
00:03:35,414 --> 00:03:37,067
you will see what I mean in a moment.

63
00:03:38,140 --> 00:03:39,677
I'm just gonna say Copy 4 items.

64
00:03:39,912 --> 00:03:42,241
So the four items that I'm copying for here,

65
00:03:42,376 --> 00:03:44,372
as I said, they will be provided to you.

66
00:03:44,507 --> 00:03:48,376
You will be able to download
them, either through links or

67
00:03:48,411 --> 00:03:50,710
I will post the files directly on Udemy.

68
00:03:50,845 --> 00:03:52,426
I'll see if they allow me that.

69
00:03:53,409 --> 00:03:55,367
So, you will be able to get them from the net

70
00:03:55,502 --> 00:03:57,644
because, obviously, you
won't have them on your machine.

71
00:03:58,835 --> 00:04:00,875
Go back to the folder that you just created, Efi

72
00:04:00,910 --> 00:04:04,222
and then Boot. Go into Boot and say Paste 4 items.

73
00:04:05,559 --> 00:04:10,679
And there you go, so we have
four items that have been pasted here.

74
00:04:12,141 --> 00:04:14,109
Just need to leave them as such, no big deal.

75
00:04:15,226 --> 00:04:18,835
Now, if you have followed
the tutorials along the merry way,

76
00:04:18,970 --> 00:04:22,261
as I have shown them, in the
order in which they were given,

77
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,368
if you have followed through
this whole section for a Mac

78
00:04:25,503 --> 00:04:29,555
on how to do this, on how to
first create a virtual machine,

79
00:04:29,890 --> 00:04:33,609
install it, etc. then this next
part won't be a problem to you.

80
00:04:33,844 --> 00:04:36,530
If it is a problem to you, if you're just going

81
00:04:36,665 --> 00:04:38,662
skipping through the
videos and going where you can

82
00:04:38,797 --> 00:04:41,509
or what you think is interesting, I would suggest

83
00:04:41,544 --> 00:04:45,153
to go back a few tutorials
within this section and have a look

84
00:04:45,188 --> 00:04:48,164
at how I have made this particular set-up.

85
00:04:49,998 --> 00:04:53,388
I'm stating this because I'm
about to open up a virtual machine

86
00:04:53,523 --> 00:04:57,146
and format a partition from within Kali.

87
00:04:59,648 --> 00:05:01,975
I have demonstrated how to create this set-up,

88
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:05,194
now we're just going to utilize our set-up

89
00:05:05,329 --> 00:05:07,547
in the previous tutorials to our advantage.

90
00:05:08,209 --> 00:05:09,587
Go into Downloads... oh well.

91
00:05:10,746 --> 00:05:12,418
Sorry, not that, in the Applications folder.

92
00:05:12,868 --> 00:05:15,643
If you have followed everything
through, you will have VirtualBox here.

93
00:05:15,678 --> 00:05:17,762
Then open it up.

94
00:05:20,062 --> 00:05:23,872
And also, we're going to need to

95
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:26,465
eject this device.

96
00:05:28,103 --> 00:05:29,683
Eject all. Yes, please.

97
00:05:32,867 --> 00:05:34,405
Again? Seriously?

98
00:05:41,266 --> 00:05:43,328
I'm definitely not using it.

99
00:05:51,258 --> 00:05:52,788
Let's go ahead and unmount it.

100
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:57,319
Actually, this is not unmount,
this is eject, but fine, whatever.

101
00:06:00,082 --> 00:06:01,608
So it's ejected.

102
00:06:03,018 --> 00:06:04,583
Let's boot up Kali.

103
00:06:05,692 --> 00:06:07,387
Wait, wait, wait, wait...

104
00:06:10,443 --> 00:06:14,230
Go into Settings first, my apologies.

105
00:06:14,531 --> 00:06:19,354
Go to Ports, USB, USB 2,

106
00:06:19,589 --> 00:06:22,772
unless you're using a
USB 3.0, which is... I don't know,

107
00:06:23,207 --> 00:06:25,097
it is an overkill, but oh well.

108
00:06:25,232 --> 00:06:28,326
And then select the USB
that you want from this menu here.

109
00:06:28,461 --> 00:06:32,164
Actually, you first need to...
Forget about... Delete it completely.

110
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:36,759
Click on the plus here
and select your USB from here,

111
00:06:38,164 --> 00:06:41,126
see it here and then go ahead and click on OK.

112
00:06:42,501 --> 00:06:44,865
Then eject this.

113
00:06:46,713 --> 00:06:48,534
Eject all.

114
00:06:51,101 --> 00:06:52,874
And then boot up Kali

115
00:06:55,378 --> 00:06:57,392
So this is a Kali virtual
machine which we have created

116
00:06:57,955 --> 00:07:00,144
in the previous tutorials. If you're just tuning in

117
00:07:00,179 --> 00:07:04,081
just go back a tutorial or two
and you'll see how this is done.

118
00:07:08,163 --> 00:07:10,389
The reason why I'm
doing this is because I cannot...

119
00:07:10,524 --> 00:07:13,904
I really don't know how...
I mean, I could basically go onto the net

120
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:16,638
and figure it out, how to do it on a Mac but

121
00:07:16,773 --> 00:07:20,410
it's just so much easier
for me to do this on a Linux.

122
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:25,576
and to format the partition
the way I want to format it.

123
00:07:25,611 --> 00:07:30,269
We're gonna use Gparted,
which is just so awesome of a tool

124
00:07:30,304 --> 00:07:33,534
that I have come to love
and admire over the years,

125
00:07:34,838 --> 00:07:36,656
to format our second partition.

126
00:07:39,204 --> 00:07:42,214
So we're just basically gonna do that.

127
00:07:51,103 --> 00:07:53,329
Come on, come on.

128
00:07:56,081 --> 00:08:00,483
Booting. Excellent. So you see,
I already have these two here.

129
00:08:02,079 --> 00:08:04,395
Kali can see both partitions without any problems.

130
00:08:04,430 --> 00:08:09,837
Now we're gonna open up
the terminal and type in "gparted".

131
00:08:28,079 --> 00:08:30,160
Okay, apparently, I cannot spell.

132
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:40,207
In the upper right corner, select your USB device.

133
00:08:40,242 --> 00:08:43,028
Make sure that you have selected your USB device.

134
00:08:44,512 --> 00:08:47,040
Just take a look at the size
and that should help you out.

135
00:08:47,075 --> 00:08:50,089
So it will say that one partition is the boot

136
00:08:50,124 --> 00:08:54,084
and that the other one
is basically just some fat32

137
00:08:54,119 --> 00:08:55,937
and it's gonna say the size.

138
00:08:57,209 --> 00:08:58,934
Go ahead and unmount it.

139
00:09:01,353 --> 00:09:03,620
Unmounting, unmounting. Come on.

140
00:09:07,485 --> 00:09:09,421
Anytime, my good man, anytime.

141
00:09:09,456 --> 00:09:13,544
Go ahead and right click
on it again and say Format to,

142
00:09:13,679 --> 00:09:16,350
and we are going to...

143
00:09:17,791 --> 00:09:21,367
Actually, I'm gonna delete it first

144
00:09:22,361 --> 00:09:26,827
and then I'm gonna say New.

145
00:09:26,962 --> 00:09:30,526
Leave everything as it is, just right here

146
00:09:38,474 --> 00:09:42,816
casper-rw. Leave it as a primary partition,

147
00:09:42,951 --> 00:09:47,873
go ahead and click on Add
and then we're gonna go into

148
00:09:50,579 --> 00:09:53,896
Edit, Apply all operations.
Well, before we actually do that

149
00:09:55,378 --> 00:09:58,824
let's just be cheesy a little bit
and see if we can change the label

150
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:00,636
since I was a genius who didn't change it

151
00:10:00,771 --> 00:10:04,340
and I like to complicate
things which will likely mess it up.

152
00:10:04,475 --> 00:10:06,220
I don't think I will be able to do this,

153
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,478
but let's see if there is an option

154
00:10:11,486 --> 00:10:13,272
just to change the label of the device.

155
00:10:15,232 --> 00:10:17,424
I probably can but I need to reformat it.

156
00:10:19,479 --> 00:10:23,159
Forget about it, I'm not
gonna ruin this session with that.

157
00:10:24,675 --> 00:10:26,863
But doesn't really matter, I've unmounted it,

158
00:10:26,898 --> 00:10:28,564
it says "creating primary partition"

159
00:10:28,799 --> 00:10:34,671
"ext4,49.78" that's 50 gigs, "on /dev/sdb".

160
00:10:35,745 --> 00:10:38,593
Fantastic, so I didn't
really feel like reformatting this

161
00:10:38,628 --> 00:10:41,666
and going straight in the
beginning just because it says Untitled 1.

162
00:10:41,801 --> 00:10:44,366
Sure it's nicer when it says Kali, but live with it.

163
00:10:44,501 --> 00:10:46,426
I mean, if you want to change it, feel free.

164
00:10:47,971 --> 00:10:49,582
Feel free to change it at the beginning

165
00:10:49,617 --> 00:10:52,286
or go through the procedure
again, doesn't really matter at all.

166
00:10:52,421 --> 00:10:57,611
Now that all of this
is done, we're gonna say Quit.

167
00:10:57,746 --> 00:11:01,604
We're gonna close the virtual machine

168
00:11:03,732 --> 00:11:05,741
and we're gonna close...

169
00:11:06,958 --> 00:11:08,639
sure we can close this as well.

170
00:11:08,774 --> 00:11:12,387
And in the follow-up tutorial we shall install

171
00:11:12,622 --> 00:11:16,624
another thing from the net.
Again, I shall provide the links for this

172
00:11:16,659 --> 00:11:20,473
or the download itself,
which we will be able to utilize

173
00:11:20,608 --> 00:11:24,131
in order to create
the boot, which will be the third

174
00:11:24,166 --> 00:11:26,545
and hopefully, the final portion of this series.

175
00:11:26,680 --> 00:11:28,505
If you're wondering why I'm fragmenting them so

176
00:11:28,540 --> 00:11:31,143
it's because I have
certain time limitations for videos

177
00:11:31,478 --> 00:11:33,755
when I put them on Udemy.

178
00:11:33,790 --> 00:11:36,423
Until then, I bid you all farewell.
