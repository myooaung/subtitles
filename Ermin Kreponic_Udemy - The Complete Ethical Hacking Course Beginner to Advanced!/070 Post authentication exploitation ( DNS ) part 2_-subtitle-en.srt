1
00:00:00,360 --> 00:00:02,630
Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,630 --> 00:00:04,110
Today I am going to go ahead and start

3
00:00:05,150 --> 00:00:09,970
using the tools which I have previously
mentioned, dnschef and Set toolkit.

4
00:00:09,970 --> 00:00:14,330
Now Set Toolkit,
well it's actually called Set, but

5
00:00:14,330 --> 00:00:18,350
here you're gonna invoke it
with a command Set Toolkit.

6
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,970
Anyway, We're going to use
it to clone a website.

7
00:00:22,970 --> 00:00:30,110
And we're going to use dnschef to
redirect all requests to that website,

8
00:00:30,110 --> 00:00:35,470
from the machines which answer to our
DNS servers to a particular IP address.

9
00:00:35,470 --> 00:00:39,850
Now if this sounds a bit complex, or if
you didn't understand exactly what I said.

10
00:00:39,850 --> 00:00:40,700
Bear with me for

11
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:45,920
a moment here, and soon you will
realize very fast what I meant by it.

12
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,110
So let's just go ahead and
bring up this dnschef command here,

13
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:52,040
you can do this manually as well.

14
00:00:52,040 --> 00:00:55,953
You can actually configure
a DNS server to run locally.

15
00:00:55,953 --> 00:01:01,071
And to conduct host name
to IP address resolutions.

16
00:01:01,071 --> 00:01:03,769
But that's a bit complex, and
there's a lot of configuration involved.

17
00:01:03,769 --> 00:01:07,908
It's a lot simpler to just
use the dnschef tool kit.

18
00:01:07,908 --> 00:01:13,943
And here you have these arguments,
which I've mentioned just now.

19
00:01:13,943 --> 00:01:19,065
Where a domain name gets
resolved to an IP address.

20
00:01:19,065 --> 00:01:21,550
So basically give any IP
address that you want here.

21
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,928
Basically that will be
of your own web server.

22
00:01:23,928 --> 00:01:26,760
So your own IP address within LAN.

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,690
And here you have a fake domains.

24
00:01:28,690 --> 00:01:33,510
So you give a name of a real domain,
and specify an interface.

25
00:01:33,510 --> 00:01:36,000
Now here's what I mean by this.

26
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,790
Here where it says fakeip,
this can be your IP within LAN on which

27
00:01:38,790 --> 00:01:41,960
your Apache server is running,
your web server.

28
00:01:41,960 --> 00:01:46,607
Or you can give it your public IP address.

29
00:01:46,607 --> 00:01:48,441
So if give it your public IP address,

30
00:01:48,441 --> 00:01:51,590
you're going to need to do some
configuration on your router.

31
00:01:51,590 --> 00:01:55,142
In order to let traffic
pass to your web server.

32
00:01:55,142 --> 00:01:58,000
However, this is not really advisable.

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,605
Rather, instead,
what is far better is to have a VPN.

34
00:02:01,605 --> 00:02:04,718
I have showed you in the previous
tutorials how you can use, and

35
00:02:04,718 --> 00:02:06,260
configure with VPN services.

36
00:02:07,330 --> 00:02:08,340
Quite simple, actually.

37
00:02:08,340 --> 00:02:09,890
Nothing much to it.

38
00:02:09,890 --> 00:02:11,510
It's in your Network Manager.

39
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:14,340
You just add a VPN of a different kind,
and that's it.

40
00:02:14,340 --> 00:02:18,790
You need PPTP VPN with
a static IP address.

41
00:02:18,790 --> 00:02:22,530
Think it's gonna cost you about ten
bucks a month, something like that,

42
00:02:22,530 --> 00:02:23,340
if you wanna run it.

43
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:30,098
If you want to do this attack over outside
of your LAN network, but within LAN,

44
00:02:30,098 --> 00:02:32,819
we're gonna use some local IP addresses.

45
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,170
Now key thing to note,
there is no difference here literally.

46
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,021
Between an attack within your own network,
or outside of your own network.

47
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,130
The only difference is the IP
addresses that are used.

48
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:44,960
And the second thing,

49
00:02:44,960 --> 00:02:50,140
this will pretty much work with
every single website out there.

50
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,800
However there are some caching
problems with browsers.

51
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:59,100
So that can present
some difficulties here.

52
00:02:59,100 --> 00:03:00,370
But we'll see how we'll see how it goes.

53
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:01,094
First of all we've infected
a router with our own DNS.

54
00:03:01,094 --> 00:03:02,711
We've changed the DNS settings there.

55
00:03:02,711 --> 00:03:04,933
And now we're gonna run dnschef.

56
00:03:04,933 --> 00:03:08,453
Now the interface specification is
simply the interface you are using.

57
00:03:08,453 --> 00:03:11,694
If you're not sure which interface you are
using, you can check that with if config.

58
00:03:11,694 --> 00:03:13,995
Which I have showed you in
the previous tutorials.

59
00:03:13,995 --> 00:03:16,087
Or you can actually type in all zeros.

60
00:03:16,087 --> 00:03:17,975
So, instead of 192 you can type in a 0.

61
00:03:17,975 --> 00:03:19,926
Instead of 168, a 0.

62
00:03:19,926 --> 00:03:21,313
Instead of 1, a 0.

63
00:03:21,313 --> 00:03:24,630
And instead of 102 a 0 as well.

64
00:03:24,630 --> 00:03:30,196
Yeah, this should work as far as I see.

65
00:03:30,196 --> 00:03:34,166
But as the tutorial progresses,
I'll see how it goes.

66
00:03:34,166 --> 00:03:36,619
I did give it a shot a couple of
times before this tutorial and

67
00:03:36,619 --> 00:03:37,510
I had some problems.

68
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:40,710
Hopefully, you will not
encounter the same.

69
00:03:40,710 --> 00:03:43,850
I've had some problems due to
the configuration that I am running

70
00:03:43,850 --> 00:03:44,540
in the background.

71
00:03:45,960 --> 00:03:48,240
But I had to change a lot of things.

72
00:03:48,240 --> 00:03:51,190
But none of those things,
you won't need to do any of those things.

73
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:54,470
Primarily, because you're going to be
using your home computer where you don't

74
00:03:54,470 --> 00:03:58,400
have these crazy things
that I have here as well.

75
00:03:58,400 --> 00:03:59,730
Anyway enough of that nonsense.

76
00:03:59,730 --> 00:04:02,710
I'm just going to go ahead and run this.

77
00:04:04,460 --> 00:04:08,920
And in case you didn't figure
out what these IP addresses are,

78
00:04:08,920 --> 00:04:12,570
let me just type in ifconfig,
and there you go.

79
00:04:12,570 --> 00:04:14,712
Eth0 that's the interface that I
used to connect to the internet.

80
00:04:14,712 --> 00:04:20,780
And that's the LAN IP address
that I have been assigned.

81
00:04:20,780 --> 00:04:22,570
192.168.1.102.
That is the same IP address with which we

82
00:04:22,570 --> 00:04:27,460
have typed into our router to
be our designated DNS server.

83
00:04:28,690 --> 00:04:30,150
But this is randomname.com.

84
00:04:30,150 --> 00:04:33,771
Okay, that's not gonna work,
probably, because randomname.com.

85
00:04:33,771 --> 00:04:37,291
Okay, it might exist, but
I honestly don't know.

86
00:04:37,291 --> 00:04:40,451
So let's just go over and
pick one website.

87
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:44,491
We're not really gonna do anything to
a website, so it doesn't really matter.

88
00:04:44,491 --> 00:04:49,536
My favorite forum, Linux Questions.

89
00:04:49,536 --> 00:04:52,790
This is definitely the place to be.

90
00:04:52,790 --> 00:04:57,100
The amount of answers that
people give here is amazing.

91
00:04:57,100 --> 00:05:00,856
And I don't think anybody's going to every
going to try to hack your user name and

92
00:05:00,856 --> 00:05:02,083
password for this forum.

93
00:05:02,083 --> 00:05:03,522
Primarily because there is no point.

94
00:05:03,522 --> 00:05:05,901
There are no finances here or
anything of this kind.

95
00:05:05,901 --> 00:05:09,440
This is just people
helping one another out.

96
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,360
We're just going to go ahead and
copy this.

97
00:05:14,540 --> 00:05:18,000
Minimize the browser,
reinvoke our command.

98
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:21,170
Where it says fake domain.

99
00:05:22,770 --> 00:05:27,800
Got to delete this,
paste linuxquestions.org.

100
00:05:27,800 --> 00:05:28,730
Go ahead and press enter.

101
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:34,520
And that's gonna resolve all requests
on our DNS servers from that.

102
00:05:34,520 --> 00:05:38,860
All the requests that have
the linuxquestions.org will inevitably be

103
00:05:38,860 --> 00:05:42,220
resolved to this IP address here,
which is our own website server.

104
00:05:42,220 --> 00:05:46,600
But that's not gonna do us much good, if
we don't have a web server that's running.

105
00:05:47,920 --> 00:05:50,270
So let's just take of that shall we?

106
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,260
Clear the screen.

107
00:05:52,260 --> 00:05:54,880
Do I have anything of importance here?

108
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:56,441
No I do not.

109
00:05:56,441 --> 00:06:00,023
Now we need to do a set tool kit.

110
00:06:00,023 --> 00:06:04,259
setoolkit.

111
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:05,976
Keynote there is no double t here.

112
00:06:05,976 --> 00:06:08,304
So set and then double o.

113
00:06:08,304 --> 00:06:13,330
Press Enter, and
this tool is extremely easy to use.

114
00:06:13,330 --> 00:06:14,418
I mean, there isn't really much to it.

115
00:06:16,615 --> 00:06:17,610
It's very powerful, but it's very simple.

116
00:06:17,610 --> 00:06:25,130
I have no idea how they achieved to
do this, but apparently they have.

117
00:06:25,130 --> 00:06:29,540
Anyway, you have a great deal of
options here which you can use.

118
00:06:29,540 --> 00:06:33,730
I would definitely advise that
you try some of them out.

119
00:06:33,730 --> 00:06:36,360
Definitely type in 6 for
help, see what's there.

120
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:38,600
Just read a little bit through it.

121
00:06:38,600 --> 00:06:41,280
I mean, you're probably not
gonna try all of them out, but

122
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:46,020
I would definitely advise that you
pick a couple, or at least one.

123
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,370
Other than the one that we're going
to use today, and see how it works.

124
00:06:51,370 --> 00:06:53,060
All of these things have
their own submenus.

125
00:06:53,060 --> 00:06:54,790
So let's go into
Social-Engineering Attacks.

126
00:06:54,790 --> 00:06:58,224
See, there is like,
Spear-Phishing Attack Vectors,

127
00:06:58,224 --> 00:07:02,803
Website Attack Vectors, Infectious
Media Generator, Create a Payload,

128
00:07:02,803 --> 00:07:06,180
Mass Mailer,
except there are lots of things here.

129
00:07:06,180 --> 00:07:10,040
You can conclude what they are for
a lot of them just by reading the names.

130
00:07:10,040 --> 00:07:12,690
But I would definitely advise
you to read a bit more.

131
00:07:12,690 --> 00:07:16,760
And to just try, try ,try some of
these things because there's so

132
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:17,670
many options here.

133
00:07:17,670 --> 00:07:19,670
There's so many vectors of attack.

134
00:07:19,670 --> 00:07:20,170
It's ridiculous.

135
00:07:21,380 --> 00:07:23,040
It's something,

136
00:07:23,040 --> 00:07:29,260
something is bound to work on the site
that you want to do something on.

137
00:07:29,260 --> 00:07:30,430
Something's bound to work.

138
00:07:30,430 --> 00:07:34,765
Not only setoolkit, but you have so many
tools here in Kali Linux, and on the net.

139
00:07:34,765 --> 00:07:38,360
So many options, something's bound
to work, so don't worry about it.

140
00:07:39,500 --> 00:07:42,633
Anyway, what we need is
Website Attack Vectors.

141
00:07:42,633 --> 00:07:44,929
Because we're gonna be doing that.

142
00:07:44,929 --> 00:07:48,184
And again, we have sub menus,
a lot of them.

143
00:07:48,184 --> 00:07:50,723
Let's go with
Credential Harvester Attack Method.

144
00:07:50,723 --> 00:07:52,568
Because we want to take some credentials.

145
00:07:52,568 --> 00:07:56,824
So press three, and
now we want a Site Cloner.

146
00:07:56,824 --> 00:08:01,835
So we want to clone the site, and
have it stored on our local web server.

147
00:08:01,835 --> 00:08:03,051
This is web templates.

148
00:08:03,051 --> 00:08:05,943
You can have a web template
that is standing by somewhere.

149
00:08:05,943 --> 00:08:08,517
You can clone a site or
you can custom import.

150
00:08:08,517 --> 00:08:11,350
Anyway, press two.

151
00:08:11,350 --> 00:08:14,660
IP address, so I need the IP address.

152
00:08:14,660 --> 00:08:20,270
And in order to get the IP address I'm
afraid I'm gonna need to use a ping.

153
00:08:20,270 --> 00:08:24,270
But just zoom in

154
00:08:24,270 --> 00:08:29,810
a little bit nslookup

155
00:08:29,810 --> 00:08:36,284
linuxquestions.org.

156
00:08:36,284 --> 00:08:41,329
Amazing, amazing, nslookup.

157
00:08:41,329 --> 00:08:47,055
Okay, so this is the domain and
this is the IP address.

158
00:08:47,055 --> 00:08:48,603
We'll just do this instead.

159
00:08:48,603 --> 00:08:51,110
You can also check it like this,
it's a lot simpler.

160
00:08:51,110 --> 00:08:52,827
Just type in ping.

161
00:08:52,827 --> 00:08:54,043
And there we go.

162
00:08:56,827 --> 00:09:02,501
Same IP address just a different method I
suppose I'd want to choose something else.

163
00:09:02,501 --> 00:09:06,457
So IP address but we don't
actually have the IP address here.

164
00:09:06,457 --> 00:09:07,685
Sorry this is my mistake.

165
00:09:07,685 --> 00:09:12,060
This option is used for
what the server in the post do.

166
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:13,630
So sorry.
This is my bad.

167
00:09:13,630 --> 00:09:19,130
You need to type in 192.168.1.102.

168
00:09:19,130 --> 00:09:22,663
Basically this your IP address.

169
00:09:22,663 --> 00:09:23,870
And for
the post back in Harvester/Tabnabbing.

170
00:09:23,870 --> 00:09:27,290
If you are, yep.

171
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:28,080
Here we go.

172
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:31,230
So, it also says if you
are using external IP address,

173
00:09:32,270 --> 00:09:34,640
use your external IP address for this.

174
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,230
But we are obviously not going to
use our external IP addresses.

175
00:09:38,230 --> 00:09:41,110
Not today, but
of course you can if you have a VPN.

176
00:09:41,110 --> 00:09:43,679
Press ENTER here and
now we need a domain name.

177
00:09:43,679 --> 00:09:46,255
The full thing with HTTP and WWW.

178
00:09:46,255 --> 00:09:48,943
Easiest way is just to go ahead and

179
00:09:48,943 --> 00:09:54,070
CTRL+C, and then paste it back in here,
and there you go.

180
00:09:54,070 --> 00:10:00,570
Notice that the protocol is HTTP,
but this works with HTTPS as well.

181
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:01,810
There's literally no difference,

182
00:10:01,810 --> 00:10:05,880
just type in HTTPS and
it's gonna clone it no problem.

183
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:11,140
So you can see here, in the title it
says SET supports both HTTP and HTTPS.

184
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:12,600
You don't have to worry about it.

185
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:13,900
It says right here in the title.

186
00:10:13,900 --> 00:10:16,320
And I have tried it out
with some HTTPS sites.

187
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:18,990
It does indeed work, no problems at all.

188
00:10:20,760 --> 00:10:22,530
Okay, so let's go.

189
00:10:22,530 --> 00:10:23,460
It's cloning it.

190
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:24,980
This could take a little bit of time.

191
00:10:24,980 --> 00:10:27,360
And there are a lot of
tutorials out there on the net.

192
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,128
They basically say that you should wait,
and stay here.

193
00:10:30,128 --> 00:10:33,243
But apparently with newer versions of SET,
you can't.

194
00:10:33,243 --> 00:10:39,002
So just go ahead and press Enter,
99 to exit, 99 to return.

195
00:10:39,002 --> 00:10:40,857
Exit Social- Engineering toolkit.

196
00:10:40,857 --> 00:10:42,670
Clear the screen, and
now we have our website cloned.

197
00:10:42,670 --> 00:10:46,560
Let me just show that to you.

198
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:51,755
So this is LinuxQuestions.org,

199
00:10:51,755 --> 00:10:58,927
and if I type in 192.168.1.102.

200
00:10:58,927 --> 00:11:00,270
You see, there we go.

201
00:11:00,270 --> 00:11:01,800
This our IP address, and
the website is pretty much the same.

202
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:09,900
Okay, the zoom is different,
but I suppose I can zoom it in.

203
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:10,460
No problems there.

204
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,090
Maybe, the site that we have copied is

205
00:11:18,520 --> 00:11:21,070
even better because
there are no ads on it.

206
00:11:21,070 --> 00:11:22,940
That's fantastic.

207
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:24,330
We didn't copy the ad as well.

208
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:28,730
And this site that we have copied it to,
the clone,

209
00:11:28,730 --> 00:11:30,530
actually contains a JavaScript in.

210
00:11:30,530 --> 00:11:33,730
Which we'll harvest the credentials
if I'm not mistaken.

211
00:11:33,730 --> 00:11:37,260
How we will do that I will show
you in the follow up tutorial.

212
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:40,450
Where we will actually be
extracting the credentials,

213
00:11:40,450 --> 00:11:43,730
and saving them to our
files on our computer.

214
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:47,010
Now this sort of attack is very important.

215
00:11:47,010 --> 00:11:50,160
Primarily because some of the previous
attacks which I've showed you,

216
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:51,600
they're specific attacks.

217
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,430
And this one is a general attack.

218
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:56,350
This will work on pretty
much anything out there.

219
00:11:57,740 --> 00:12:01,920
And it can be used in combination
with SSL Strip as well.

220
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:05,840
So imagine if you can use
SSL Strip remotely somewhere

221
00:12:05,840 --> 00:12:08,290
to to the strip the requests for
encrypted sites.

222
00:12:08,290 --> 00:12:15,260
But SSL Strip doesn't always work, so
that's kind of a tricky Thing to do.

223
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:17,820
Anyway, I'm gonna leave
everything running like it is.

224
00:12:17,820 --> 00:12:20,230
And I bid you farewell.

225
00:12:20,230 --> 00:12:21,920
And I hope to see you
in the next tutorial.
