00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.600

Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.600 --> 00:00:07.000

Today I will be talking about some of the basic terms



3

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.570

which you will need order to follow this course through.



4

00:00:10.570 --> 00:00:15.200

So first off, you have three main categories of people.



5

00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:19.700

There are White Hat Hackers, Grey Hat Hackers and Black Hat Hackers.



6

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:24.300

Everything that we will be doing falls into this category here



7

00:00:24.300 --> 00:00:26.100

So, White Hats --



8

00:00:26.100 --> 00:00:30.900

Those are people whose activities are within the confines of the law.



9

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:35.809

There are people such pen testers, ethical hackers, people like you and me



10

00:00:35.809 --> 00:00:37.300

and so on.



11

00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:39.400

Then you have Grey Hat Hackers



12

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:43.280

whose activities are bordering between legal and illegal.



13

00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.300

It's a bit of a shady area there.



14

00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:49.500

In addition to that, you have the most known category



15

00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.329

which is Black Hat Hackers.



16

00:00:51.329 --> 00:00:58.100

and usually, and unfortunately, every time someone hears the term hacking



17

00:00:58.100 --> 00:01:01.900

it is associated with people from Black Hat world.



18

00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:07.500

There are people who conduct all sorts of illegal activities



19

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:10.900

or conduct activities without any regard for the law



20

00:01:10.900 --> 00:01:15.700

and, I don't know, extract new information from certain servers



21

00:01:15.700 --> 00:01:19.800

credentials, your card information, take services down



22

00:01:19.800 --> 00:01:24.800

usually to extract some sort of financial gain.



23

00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:28.900

In any case, down below you have footprinting.



24

00:01:28.900 --> 00:01:33.700

Now the act of footprinting is basically information gathering.



25

00:01:33.700 --> 00:01:39.600

You are conducting some sort of

reconnaissance work



26

00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:43.000

You are figuring out the IP of the server



27

00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:45.100

Figuring out which ports are open



28

00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:49.000

and with that, you can conclude which services are running there



29

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.720

but it doesn't necessarily need to be confined to the digital world.



30

00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:57.800

The act of footprinting can also be when you go to the company itself.



31

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:59.000

You just walk in.



32

00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:00.700

It doesn't necessarily need to be a company.



33

00:02:00.700 --> 00:02:04.100

It can be pretty much any building with servers in it



34

00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:07.100

and you have a look around.



35

00:02:07.100 --> 00:02:09.929

You try to gather some information there

on-site



36

00:02:09.929 --> 00:02:12.400

where you go and you through their trash cans.



37

00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:16.640

You go behind the building, jump into those

trash containers



38

00:02:16.640 --> 00:02:19.000

and get some information from there.



39

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.200

Also, people have been known to go into parking lots



40

00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.239

to see who the employees are



41

00:02:24.239 --> 00:02:26.400

and who works there.



42

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:27.510

All sorts of things.



43

00:02:27.510 --> 00:02:33.700

So this is just general information gathering, in regards to your chosen target.



44

00:02:33.700 --> 00:02:37.100

It doesn't need to be confined to the digital world.



45

00:02:37.100 --> 00:02:39.400

Anyway, down below



46

00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:42.100

you certain types of attacks --



47

00:02:42.100 --> 00:02:45.100

You have DoS and DDoS.



48

00:02:45.100 --> 00:02:50.100

Very simple. Basically the same thing implemented in a different way.



49

00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:53.800

DoS stands for "Denial of Service"



50

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:58.500

Usually called "Childish Attacks" because they're relatively easy to implement



51

00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.690

and they still are, provided of course if you have enough machines



52

00:03:02.690 --> 00:03:05.300

but that's the domain of DDoS.



53

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:11.400

In general, what happens here is that you perform a certain amount of requests



54

00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:13.430

more requests than a server can handle



55

00:03:13.430 --> 00:03:16.709

and then the server begins dropping connections.



56

00:03:16.709 --> 00:03:20.160

For example, Apache web server -- I believe

by default



57

00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.200

it can handle up to 10,000 connections or so



58

00:03:24.200 --> 00:03:27.450

and if you can make more than 10,000

requests



59

00:03:27.450 --> 00:03:32.010

basically everybody else making any sort

of requests



60

00:03:32.010 --> 00:03:34.600

will not be able to access the website



61

00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:36.300

because their connections will be dropped



62

00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:38.300

simply because Apache will say



63

00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:42.400

"Okay, I have too many users. I have more users than I can handle"



64

00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:46.300

all the other collections will be dropped by default.



65

00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:52.700

Thereby making the site inaccessible, even though you haven't really broken any codes.



66

00:03:52.700 --> 00:03:57.800

You haven't really broken through any firewalls or stole any passwords



67

00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.000

or anything of a kind



68

00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.500

but when you're DoS in something, it's just

you.



69

00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:07.200

All the connections, all the requests



70

00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:11.100

everything is coming just from your own computer



71

00:04:11.100 --> 00:04:14.300

and that it is not always the most efficient way



72

00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.500

In fact, it generally it can only work if there is a flaw



73

00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:21.989

in the way which requests are processed.



74

00:04:21.989 --> 00:04:26.760

However, that is why you have DDoS attacks



75

00:04:26.760 --> 00:04:31.700

when you have multiple computers, multiple connections



76

00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:36.900

and they are all making simultaneous requests to a certain server



77

00:04:36.900 --> 00:04:39.100

and this is really difficult fight off



78

00:04:39.100 --> 00:04:44.300

I mean, you really need to have a clever configuration of your firewall



79

00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:46.800

and need to have quite a good firewall as well.



80

00:04:46.800 --> 00:04:50.820

Usually you would need a physical one to prevent these sort of DDoS attacks



81

00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.590

and by physical, I mean a router firewall or

something a kind.



82

00:04:54.590 --> 00:04:58.020

This is quite difficult to



83

00:04:58.020 --> 00:05:02.940

it's not difficult to actually do the attack itself



84

00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:05.700

as it is difficult to make the necessary

preparations.



85

00:05:05.700 --> 00:05:10.919

First of all, you need to go about infecting other devices, which you will use



86

00:05:10.919 --> 00:05:16.300

which you will enslave and use in order to

perform this sort of attack



87

00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.540

This is the hard part.



88

00:05:17.540 --> 00:05:22.000

The DDoS part is quite easy compared to that.



89

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.220

For that, in order for you infect other computers, you need two things --



90

00:05:26.220 --> 00:05:29.710

You need RATS (Remote administration

tools)



91

00:05:29.710 --> 00:05:33.200

and you need to make them FUD.



92

00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.700

You need to make them fully undetectable.



93

00:05:35.700 --> 00:05:38.600

That is what the term FUD stands for.



94

00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.200

So it just means that they cannot be detected by antiviruses



95

00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:44.600

or they are, more precise term would be



96

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:50.300

that they are not labeled as something malicious by antivirus programs.



97

00:05:50.300 --> 00:05:55.700

By the way, sometimes actually most the times



98

00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.040

you don't actually need to make your own applications fully undetectable.



99

00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.500

There are plenty of pen testing companies

out there



100

00:06:01.500 --> 00:06:04.180

and not just pen testing companies, but other companies as well



101

00:06:04.180 --> 00:06:07.600

will pay very good sums of money



102

00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:14.300

if you can make their programs fully

undetectable by antivirus programs



103

00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:19.700

Down below, the RATS (Remote Administration Tools)



104

00:06:19.700 --> 00:06:24.700

Now, they themselves are not some sort of hacks or anything of a kind.



105

00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:30.100

They just basically put them on a USB stick or something of a kind.



106

00:06:30.100 --> 00:06:31.600

Send them in the mail



107

00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:35.000

Shared them in a zip file



108

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.700

and in such a way



109

00:06:36.700 --> 00:06:41.540

that's just one of the ways to infect other computers



110

00:06:41.540 --> 00:06:42.300

other devices



111

00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:44.300

enslave them



112

00:06:44.300 --> 00:06:48.100

convert them into your sleeves



113

00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:49.620

into the slaves of the main server



114

00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:53.200

where every death might be wherever you

might set it up



115

00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:55.700

and then you can use all of those computers



116

00:06:55.700 --> 00:06:58.100

to conduct all sorts of activities.



117

00:06:58.100 --> 00:07:02.600

This is very good because it anonymizes you to a very large extent.



118

00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.100

It's very difficult to track somebody

down, whoever is doing this



119

00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:09.800

primarily because the users, who are infected



120

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:15.300

they have no idea that somebody else is controlling their devices



121

00:07:15.300 --> 00:07:19.400

because nothing is really happening on your desktop you can't really see.



122

00:07:19.400 --> 00:07:23.050

All the processes running are being run in

the background



123

00:07:23.050 --> 00:07:26.300

and your processor is executing them



124

00:07:26.300 --> 00:07:27.920

using up



125

00:07:27.920 --> 00:07:31.540

the only way to see it would be basically to start up a task manager



126

00:07:31.540 --> 00:07:33.800

or something of a kind.



127

00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.100

and then see the running processes



128

00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:37.500

and perhaps you could spot it there



129

00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:43.200

but not even there if somebody has implemented a rootkit.



130

00:07:43.200 --> 00:07:47.620

So a rootkit is a tool basically



131

00:07:47.620 --> 00:07:50.620

which you install onto an operating system



132

00:07:50.620 --> 00:07:57.200

and it is able to hide running processes from the system itself



133

00:07:57.200 --> 00:08:00.900

So when you, for example, start a task

manager in windows



134

00:08:00.900 --> 00:08:01.880

or something of a kind



135

00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:07.500

the purpose of a rootkit would be hide the processes from the task manager.



136

00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:12.500

Basically how it works is the task manager from the system



137

00:08:12.500 --> 00:08:13.420

from the kernel



138

00:08:13.420 --> 00:08:16.400

and then the kernel of the system responds



139

00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:17.500

which is the core of the system



140

00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:21.000

where all the drivers and the key functionalities are.



141

00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.700

The kernel of the system then responds



142

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.700

"Hey, I have this this this and this process running. Here you go"



143

00:08:26.700 --> 00:08:33.500

What rootkit would do is redirect those requests from task manager to itself



144

00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:36.900

and would basically say "I don't have such processes running"



145

00:08:36.900 --> 00:08:41.100

So very very dangerous and potent combinations here



146

00:08:41.100 --> 00:08:44.900

that we will use later on as we progress through this tutorial



147

00:08:44.900 --> 00:08:48.500

but for the time being I just wanted to give a bit of an introduction to it



148

00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:51.550

and give you an idea of what we shall be doing



149

00:08:51.550 --> 00:08:54.589

through some these basic terms and concepts.



150

00:08:54.589 --> 00:08:58.560

Next up, we have phishing attacks.



151

00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:07.400

Now phishing attacks are basically when you apply some sort of bait



152

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:09.829

somebody bites it, then you pull on it.



153

00:09:09.829 --> 00:09:12.100

Simple as that, right?



154

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.670

The same way you would do fishing.



155

00:09:13.670 --> 00:09:16.100

Well not quite



156

00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:21.389

Phishing attacks would be when you get, I don't know, an email from someone



157

00:09:21.389 --> 00:09:23.100

and there's a link it



158

00:09:23.100 --> 00:09:24.200

you click on it



159

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.720

and it throws you somewhere, I don't know, on some website



160

00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:31.600

Perhaps it looks like something legit.



161

00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:35.100

Perhaps it looks like a website that you are using or something of a kind



162

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:37.600

but it is not and you pass on your credentials



163

00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:39.000

and that can be a problem



164

00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.700

but this is generally avoided today.



165

00:09:40.700 --> 00:09:43.600

This is not something that happens in such a way.



166

00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:49.000

Rather instead what happens these days is the that DNS servers gets changed



167

00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000

on your routers



168

00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000

and once that happens



169

00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.600

older requests that you made on your web browser gets redirected.



170

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:58.800

So for example, if you type in facebook.com



171

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.700

you're gonna get a domain with facebook.com



172

00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:03.800

from some private DNS server



173

00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:05.500

god knows where



174

00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:10.000

who's MX records are altered and they have been configured.



175

00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.100

For example, to make redirections to interpret Facebook.com



176

00:10:15.100 --> 00:10:18.269

sorry, not redirections but rather instead to interpret Facebook.com



177

00:10:18.269 --> 00:10:22.389

to certain IP address that does not belong

Facebook or anything like that.



178

00:10:22.389 --> 00:10:24.500

So you open up your Facebook



179

00:10:24.500 --> 00:10:25.809

it looks exactly the same



180

00:10:25.809 --> 00:10:31.800

There is no way to tell because in the upper left corner of the screen



181

00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:34.000

you have the domain name written --



182

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:36.500

It's www.facebook.com



183

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:40.610

and basically provided login credentials



184

00:10:40.610 --> 00:10:42.300

once you do that, they're gone.



185

00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:43.900

Somebody has them.



186

00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.240

One of the ways to detect this



187

00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:51.470

even though it's very, I mean it's not

hard



188

00:10:51.470 --> 00:10:54.860

but nobody really pays any attention to

it.



189

00:10:54.860 --> 00:10:59.800

In the upper left corner you might check

with the protocol is HTTPS



190

00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:02.200

instead of HTTP



191

00:11:02.200 --> 00:11:05.800

because usually if these kind of attacks are conducted



192

00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:07.400

it's not gonna be HTTPS



193

00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:09.449

a status a lot harder to implement



194

00:11:09.449 --> 00:11:15.300

but if it is HTTPS, there really won't be any

legit way of figuring it out



195

00:11:15.300 --> 00:11:17.300

other then actually checking the keys



196

00:11:17.300 --> 00:11:18.400

checking the certificates and



197

00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:20.800

and nobody actually does that.



198

00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:21.800

Well maybe not nobody



199

00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:25.700

but ninety-nine percent of users out there

are not going to bother



200

00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.600

to go about conducting such checks.



201

00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.300

Anyway, I know it sounds a bit complex



202

00:11:32.300 --> 00:11:35.600

but believe me, I will explain this in great details.



203

00:11:35.600 --> 00:11:37.949

I will give you several demonstrations



204

00:11:37.949 --> 00:11:40.000

and by the end of this course



205

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.400

you will understand and know how to do this with great ease.



206

00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:48.670

It will not present a significant obstacle in your line of work.



207

00:11:48.670 --> 00:11:53.700

Excellent. Now that we have approximately

half these terms out of our way



208

00:11:53.700 --> 00:11:57.000

I will continue to deal with them in the follow up tutorial



209

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000

and I sincerely hope to see you all there
