00:00:00.480 --> 00:00:03.100

Hello everybody and welcome to this

tutorial.



2

00:00:03.100 --> 00:00:05.450

Today I will show you how to install VirtualBox



3

00:00:05.450 --> 00:00:08.700

within a Windows environment



4

00:00:08.700 --> 00:00:12.100

So previously I've showed you how to do it in a Linux environment



5

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.000

and it is a bit more complex there



6

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.200

because you do need to add repositories



7

00:00:16.200 --> 00:00:19.570

and then pull the packet from the repositories.



8

00:00:19.570 --> 00:00:20.800

You can also pull it from the website



9

00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:22.020

but that's not recommended.



10

00:00:22.020 --> 00:00:25.910

However in Windows, the process is

fairly straightforward.



11

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.000

It's fairly simple.



12

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.700

You just go ahead, open up your favorite browser



13

00:00:29.700 --> 00:00:32.000

mine is Firefox



14

00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.800

and go ahead and type in "VirtualBox"



15

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:37.000

Press "Enter"



16

00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.860

and go ahead and open up their website.



17

00:00:40.860 --> 00:00:42.000

Takes a bit to load.



18

00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.000

Don't know what the problem is.



19

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:44.510

Perhaps my internet connection is slow.



20

00:00:44.510 --> 00:00:45.300

Nevermind



21

00:00:45.300 --> 00:00:47.300

Just click on "Downloads"



22

00:00:47.300 --> 00:00:53.500

and choose "VirtualBox for 3.22 for Windows hosts"



23

00:00:53.500 --> 00:00:55.700

So just go ahead and click on it



24

00:00:55.700 --> 00:00:57.300

and I don't want to download it now



25

00:00:57.300 --> 00:01:01.800

because I've downloaded it prior to this tutorial in order to save some time



26

00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:05.900

but since you didn't, just go ahead and

click on "Save File"



27

00:01:05.900 --> 00:01:07.300

and it will download it.



28

00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:09.510

The download process will start.



29

00:01:09.510 --> 00:01:14.200

I'm just gonna go ahead and navigate

over to my downloads folder.



30

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.000

I have it right here



31

00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.990

I'm just going to go ahead and double click on it



32

00:01:17.990 --> 00:01:21.700

in order to initiate the installation wizard.



33

00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:26.049

Keep in mind that this Windows is actually a virtual machine



34

00:01:26.049 --> 00:01:30.439

and I am conducting an installation of VirtualBox



35

00:01:30.439 --> 00:01:36.000

within a machine that is being run within yet another VirtualBox.



36

00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.100

So a virtual machine within a a virtual machine



37

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.900

would be a proper way to name the

situation.



38

00:01:41.900 --> 00:01:43.090

You can see I've minimized it



39

00:01:43.090 --> 00:01:45.000

that I can pull it now



40

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.500

but it works just fine.



41

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:51.000

The installation process will go, no problems.



42

00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000

It will go fairly smoothly without any problems.



43

00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:56.500

So just go ahead and click "Next" in these options.



44

00:01:56.500 --> 00:02:00.500

You can actually browse for different installation locations here



45

00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:02.400

but the default one will do just fine.



46

00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:04.000

So just go ahead and click "Next"



47

00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.170

"Create shortcuts"



48

00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:06.900

"Register file association"



49

00:02:06.900 --> 00:02:07.800

Sure, why not?



50

00:02:07.800 --> 00:02:09.149

Click "Next"



51

00:02:09.149 --> 00:02:12.900

This warning is basically telling you



52

00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:15.000

that it will reset your network connection



53

00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.600

So if you don't want that to happen



54

00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:21.800

you might hold the installation process or something like that



55

00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:24.200

but don't worry, even if you're downloading something.



56

00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:26.600

It's not a big deal if your interfaces are reset



57

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:30.000

your connection goes down and then it comes back up again



58

00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:32.100

and your download might just stop for a while



59

00:02:32.100 --> 00:02:32.600

and that's it.



60

00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:34.900

Continue on later.



61

00:02:34.900 --> 00:02:37.010

Anyway, just go ahead and click "Yes"



62

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:40.800

Install and there we go...



63

00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:44.849

Oops! This is...no it is a not an error or something like that



64

00:02:44.849 --> 00:02:49.400

It's just Windows asking for our permission.



65

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:53.970

Anyway, the installation process has started here, no problems



66

00:02:53.970 --> 00:02:56.200

and as I was talking about previously



67

00:02:56.200 --> 00:02:58.489

this is a virtual macine within a virtual machine.



68

00:02:58.489 --> 00:03:03.400

The installation of the program will go

fine, no problems.



69

00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:07.800

However, if you plan to run another virtual machine



70

00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:09.200

within this VirtualBox



71

00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:10.579

within this virtual machine



72

00:03:10.579 --> 00:03:13.730

you might encounter some problems.



73

00:03:13.730 --> 00:03:17.160

So start VirtualBox after installation.



74

00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:17.660

Finish



75

00:03:17.660 --> 00:03:18.900

Sure, why not?



76

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:21.200

and as I said, you might encounter some problems



77

00:03:21.200 --> 00:03:22.100

performance-wise



78

00:03:22.100 --> 00:03:26.160

because, I mean, you would need to have crazy good hardware



79

00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:28.400

in order to accomplish this feat.



80

00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.000

I believe I could do it



81

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:36.500

but to the point that the virtual OS would function



82

00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:39.200

but to a very limited extent



83

00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.000

and that's it.



84

00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.300

I don't think I could actually do any meaningful work with it



85

00:03:44.300 --> 00:03:46.200

That would be quite difficult to achieve.



86

00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:47.430

But in any case



87

00:03:47.430 --> 00:03:50.560

we have our VirtualBox manager here.



88

00:03:50.560 --> 00:03:52.000

I'm spinning it around



89

00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.400

and the process of creating pretty much new virtual machines



90

00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:58.489

is exactly the same, more or less.



91

00:03:58.489 --> 00:04:02.190

The options have the same places



92

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:04.700

so you'll be able to follow this tutorial through



93

00:04:04.700 --> 00:04:06.120

even if you are using Windows



94

00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:08.700

and have created a virtual machine.



95

00:04:08.700 --> 00:04:10.169

For the most part, anyway.



96

00:04:10.169 --> 00:04:14.700

I'm just gonna go ahead and close it now.



97

00:04:14.700 --> 00:04:16.000

I will uninstall it here



98

00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:17.970

because it is completely pointless for the time being.



99

00:04:17.970 --> 00:04:19.300

But in any case



100

00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:23.900

I hope that this was helpful to all the Windows users out there



101

00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:25.000

because, let's face it



102

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000

a lot of people do use Windows.



103

00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.850

However, for pen testing purposes



104

00:04:29.850 --> 00:04:31.600

for ethical hacking



105

00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:35.500

Windows is not the best operating system to use out there



106

00:04:35.500 --> 00:04:39.700

primarily because it's a lot harder to become anonymous with Windows



107

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.740

to an anonymize yourself



108

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:44.710

and furthermore most the pen testing hacking tools



109

00:04:44.710 --> 00:04:48.970

were actually designed for Unix/Linux

like environments



110

00:04:48.970 --> 00:04:52.300

to work in combination with their

terminals.



111

00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:57.910

However, the choice of the operating system is completely up to you.



112

00:04:57.910 --> 00:05:01.290

I will be working with Fedora, Linux



113

00:05:01.290 --> 00:05:04.600

and I will most likely be using this

Windows machine



114

00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:06.400

as some sort of a victim



115

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:10.000

which we will be attacking and exploiting.



116

00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000

Anyway, I bid you all farewell



117

00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.110

and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
