00:00:00.870 --> 00:00:05.720

Hello everybody and welcome to
this tutorial, this is part three.



2

00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:08.950

Anyway today we're just gonna do
a little bit more configuration.



3

00:00:08.950 --> 00:00:12.710

So just do commands,
you need to do this one.



4

00:00:13.720 --> 00:00:18.510

So you need to make an adjustment
to your firewall and



5

00:00:18.510 --> 00:00:23.180

make sure that you have this port here,
and port 80 here.



6

00:00:23.180 --> 00:00:26.206

You can follow through exactly
the same command as I have,



7

00:00:26.206 --> 00:00:28.632

except you need to change
the interface here.



8

00:00:28.632 --> 00:00:33.176

And you can see I've been testing
this on my physical machine so



9

00:00:33.176 --> 00:00:38.592

I've used the wireless interface there,
but here it would be eth, oops.



10

00:00:38.592 --> 00:00:40.594

A moment.



11

00:00:40.594 --> 00:00:43.081

Here it would be eth0, and



12

00:00:43.081 --> 00:00:49.139

likewise you will adapt it to
whatever you your operating system,



13

00:00:49.139 --> 00:00:54.352

your markation for
that interface that you are using is.



14

00:00:54.352 --> 00:00:57.446

If you are using Kali Linux as I am for
this for



15

00:00:57.446 --> 00:01:02.132

the purposes of this tutorial, and
if you have a default install,



16

00:01:02.132 --> 00:01:07.752

then you can type in exactly the same
command as I have typed in now, with eth0.



17

00:01:07.752 --> 00:01:12.952

Anyway, [SOUND] don't need
to reset the service again.



18

00:01:12.952 --> 00:01:18.674

In addition to that command,
[SOUND] where is it?



19

00:01:18.674 --> 00:01:19.594

Here.



20

00:01:19.594 --> 00:01:24.210

Excellent, so
you will need to do this as well.



21

00:01:24.210 --> 00:01:26.520

I know that we've done this
in the previous tutorial but



22

00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.574

I take it that we're
doing it from scratch.



23

00:01:30.574 --> 00:01:35.518

So it's echo 1 and
just put it into ip_forward.



24

00:01:35.518 --> 00:01:37.316

I'm not gonna go too much into this or



25

00:01:37.316 --> 00:01:41.156

how you can check it because I already
explained it in the previous tutorials.



26

00:01:41.156 --> 00:01:46.125

Down below are just some scripts, some of
which we have downloaded from the net and



27

00:01:46.125 --> 00:01:49.090

the rest you can download
on your own if you wish.



28

00:01:50.320 --> 00:01:56.300

But in any case,
I want to actually get this started.



29

00:01:56.300 --> 00:02:02.162

And before I can do that I just need
to do a budget configuration quickly.



30

00:02:02.162 --> 00:02:04.300

Nothing really special about that.



31

00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:06.210

You make this directory.



32

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.180

So, like this.



33

00:02:08.410 --> 00:02:12.020

Mkdir /var/www/tmp, press enter.



34

00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:15.720

Okay, cannot create directory
because I have already created it.



35

00:02:15.720 --> 00:02:20.780

And down below is the mod change for
permissions actually.



36

00:02:20.780 --> 00:02:22.878

You are changing permissions for
that directory.



37

00:02:22.878 --> 00:02:25.742

So nothing frightening there.



38

00:02:25.742 --> 00:02:28.870

It's just chmod 777 and



39

00:02:28.870 --> 00:02:33.502

make sure that it's /var/www/tmp.



40

00:02:33.502 --> 00:02:35.180

That's it.



41

00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:38.780

The mod was already 777 there,
but whatever.



42

00:02:38.780 --> 00:02:39.400

I'm just gonna do it one more time.



43

00:02:40.890 --> 00:02:43.188

Anyway, go ahead and clear your screen.



44

00:02:43.188 --> 00:02:50.390

Service httpd restart.



45

00:02:50.390 --> 00:02:52.380

Oh, it's not httpd, sorry.



46

00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:54.860

Httpd is for Fedora.



47

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:59.670

Here, it's apache2,
just the name of the package.



48

00:02:59.670 --> 00:03:00.654

Come on.



49

00:03:04.334 --> 00:03:05.390

There we go.



50

00:03:05.390 --> 00:03:06.721

It's gonna, yep.



51

00:03:06.721 --> 00:03:08.940

It's going to restart.



52

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:10.680

Anyway, it's going to bump up a warning.



53

00:03:10.680 --> 00:03:16.300

It says could not reliably determine
the server's fully qualified domain name.



54

00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.340

It doesn't matter.



55

00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:18.900

That's just a warning.



56

00:03:18.900 --> 00:03:22.490

You are not required to
actually set that up.



57

00:03:22.490 --> 00:03:24.600

The server will run just fine without it.



58

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:28.100

Go ahead and clear the screen.



59

00:03:28.100 --> 00:03:31.070

We have a squid that is
running at the moment,



60

00:03:31.070 --> 00:03:32.920

since we have restarted it a moment ago.



61

00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:37.200

Now, we need to conduct an ARP spoof here.



62

00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:41.998

I've been conducting a bit of ARP
spoofing myself prior to this



63

00:03:41.998 --> 00:03:45.902

tutorial just to make sure
that everything works.



64

00:03:45.902 --> 00:03:47.742

And I do believe, here we go.



65

00:03:47.742 --> 00:03:51.534

I have it.
So type in arpspoof -i for interface,



66

00:03:51.534 --> 00:03:55.670

-t for a victim, and
-r for a default gateway.



67

00:03:57.300 --> 00:04:03.630

Then just flip them around, and,
come on, tell me I have them flipped.



68

00:04:03.630 --> 00:04:04.774

I do have them flipped.



69

00:04:04.774 --> 00:04:06.217

Wow, this is amazing.



70

00:04:06.217 --> 00:04:06.811

Excellent.



71

00:04:06.811 --> 00:04:10.032

In the previous tutorials I have
explained why this is necessary,



72

00:04:10.032 --> 00:04:11.193

why you need to do this.



73

00:04:11.193 --> 00:04:15.460

I know that my victim's IP address is,
the last octet is 101.



74

00:04:15.460 --> 00:04:19.810

If you don't know what
it is just use nmap and



75

00:04:19.810 --> 00:04:23.340

figure out which hosts
are alive on the network.



76

00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:26.180

Go ahead and press enter here,
press enter here.



77

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:31.030

The ARP spoofing process is alive and
rolling.



78

00:04:31.030 --> 00:04:36.620

Go ahead and click on your Windows 8,
well I'm using Windows 8.1 machine,



79

00:04:36.620 --> 00:04:42.020

you could be using something else,
completely irrelevant what we are using.



80

00:04:42.020 --> 00:04:45.490

Plenty of operating systems out there.



81

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.592

Now keynote here.



82

00:04:47.592 --> 00:04:50.547

These scripts are not always gonna work,
and



83

00:04:50.547 --> 00:04:53.590

not all of them will work
with the same things.



84

00:04:53.590 --> 00:04:58.930

So just read through the files
when you download them.



85

00:04:58.930 --> 00:05:01.090

Read what they say.



86

00:05:01.090 --> 00:05:05.200

If there are any readme files or
if it doesn't work with something,



87

00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:10.740

just type it out on the forums, type it
out on your favorite search engine and



88

00:05:10.740 --> 00:05:13.630

you will see that people before you
have encountered similar problems.



89

00:05:15.030 --> 00:05:19.934

And they will, you will pretty much
be able to see what is going on.



90

00:05:19.934 --> 00:05:25.080

So I do need to show you
something with this terminal here.



91

00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.480

I need a large one.



92

00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:27.940

Tell me you're gonna increase.



93

00:05:27.940 --> 00:05:29.400

No, you will not.



94

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:30.390

Properties.



95

00:05:33.270 --> 00:05:34.950

Oh this is a cursor size, sorry.



96

00:05:34.950 --> 00:05:40.190

I need a font, I need a lot larger
font cuz I am apparently blind.



97

00:05:40.190 --> 00:05:41.134

No, larger than this.



98

00:05:45.452 --> 00:05:47.054

Give me this.



99

00:05:47.054 --> 00:05:48.640

Excellent.



100

00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:51.110

So I'm just going to
clear the screen here.



101

00:05:51.110 --> 00:05:52.832

CLS this here.



102

00:05:52.832 --> 00:05:57.072

And this is how I know for
sure that this computer is ARP spoofed.



103

00:05:57.072 --> 00:05:59.887

This is something that I've
been meaning to tell you, but



104

00:05:59.887 --> 00:06:01.674

I just never got around to it really.



105

00:06:01.674 --> 00:06:07.672

You type in arp -a, for
all, and press enter.



106

00:06:07.672 --> 00:06:11.834

OK, so this is one interface,
another, another.



107

00:06:11.834 --> 00:06:15.032

We're not interested in those,
we are interested in this one.



108

00:06:15.032 --> 00:06:17.400

How do I know that I am
interested in this one?



109

00:06:18.770 --> 00:06:21.900

Well, you type in ipconfig.



110

00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:27.490

And you go to the,
you have the names of the adapters here.



111

00:06:27.490 --> 00:06:30.170

So ethernet adapter virtual
box is the only network.



112

00:06:30.170 --> 00:06:33.850

Not that.
I need ethernet adapter ethernet.



113

00:06:33.850 --> 00:06:37.906

And that's going to be 192.168.0.1.



114

00:06:37.906 --> 00:06:42.353

I can't select things on
this wretched CMD, but



115

00:06:42.353 --> 00:06:47.130

that is completely inferior
to the Linux terminal.



116

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:51.380

What can I really do about it?



117

00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:54.170

Anyway, type in arp -a,
scroll up to the top,



118

00:06:54.170 --> 00:06:58.346

and you will see that there is
an IP address 192.168.0.101.



119

00:06:58.346 --> 00:07:04.408

Now in the Linux we have been able to
establish what is the default gateway.



120

00:07:04.408 --> 00:07:07.067

And the default gateway is,
of course, the same for



121

00:07:07.067 --> 00:07:09.248

all the machines here on the same network.



122

00:07:09.248 --> 00:07:14.590

So the default gateway is 192.168.0.1.



123

00:07:14.590 --> 00:07:18.700

That is the very first IP
address that you see, and



124

00:07:18.700 --> 00:07:23.760

right next to is on the right side,
it says physical address and



125

00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:27.716

then it says 90-f6-52-c1-bb-18.



126

00:07:27.716 --> 00:07:31.722

Okay, so that is our default gateway.



127

00:07:31.722 --> 00:07:39.010

Down below you have a,
that's a host computer and



128

00:07:39.010 --> 00:07:44.770

below it is actually 104,
which is supposed to be exactly the same.



129

00:07:44.770 --> 00:07:48.020

Oh, apparently this is not ARP spoofed,
I wonder why.



130

00:07:49.090 --> 00:07:51.154

Let's do ipconfig.



131

00:07:53.754 --> 00:07:55.930

It's still 101.



132

00:07:55.930 --> 00:08:00.140

Let's see if this is gonna work.



133

00:08:00.140 --> 00:08:04.270

I don't know,
let's just type in Google web search.



134

00:08:04.270 --> 00:08:08.254

Google, Linux has indeed added it,
but why hasn't it arp spoofed?



135

00:08:08.254 --> 00:08:11.772

That is what I want to know.



136

00:08:11.772 --> 00:08:14.572

arp -a, press enter.



137

00:08:18.692 --> 00:08:23.993

Hm, this is



138

00:08:23.993 --> 00:08:31.420

quite strange.



139

00:08:31.420 --> 00:08:35.560

The MAC addresses are actually
exactly the same, how I have no idea.



140

00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:37.310

Apparently it's not registering it.



141

00:08:37.310 --> 00:08:39.930

Probably because it's a virtual machine.



142

00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:44.640

But usually when I do
168.0.104 will be the same,



143

00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:51.760

will have the same MAC address
as the default gateway.



144

00:08:52.790 --> 00:08:56.460

Why isn't it showing here,
I have literally no idea.



145

00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.090

But I'm doing this segment for fun anyway.



146

00:09:00.090 --> 00:09:02.634

So we're not gonna get into that too much.



147

00:09:02.634 --> 00:09:07.100

Usually it would show on a physical
machine, it will show here for



148

00:09:07.100 --> 00:09:08.710

some strange reason.



149

00:09:08.710 --> 00:09:10.400

Maybe, that's just an assumption,
I'm not too sure.



150

00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:12.662

Because the virtual machine
that it's not showing.



151

00:09:12.662 --> 00:09:18.414

But anyway, if you see that anybody on
your ARP list has the same MAC address



152

00:09:18.414 --> 00:09:24.650

as your default gateway, you know that
there is something the matter with it.



153

00:09:24.650 --> 00:09:28.884

You know that there is a problem,
that there's something going on,



154

00:09:28.884 --> 00:09:32.832

because the odds of that are,
well, actually non-existent.



155

00:09:32.832 --> 00:09:38.069

Because MAC addresses are regulated by
manufacturers and it's not possible for



156

00:09:38.069 --> 00:09:43.392

two devices to have the same MAC address,
especially not for two recent devices.



157

00:09:43.392 --> 00:09:50.912

Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and
close this frustrating CMD.



158

00:09:50.912 --> 00:09:53.792

And you see, it says here Google and I've.



159

00:09:53.792 --> 00:09:58.512

Okay, so I'll just go back to the MSN.com.



160

00:09:58.512 --> 00:10:04.472

Anyway, my search query was Google and
if I press web search.



161

00:10:04.472 --> 00:10:09.152

No, no, no, don't fix it.



162

00:10:09.152 --> 00:10:10.754

I don't want you to fix it.



163

00:10:10.754 --> 00:10:12.792

You never fix anything.



164

00:10:12.792 --> 00:10:16.916

So Google, I press Websearch and



165

00:10:16.916 --> 00:10:20.752

the page cannot be displayed.



166

00:10:20.752 --> 00:10:23.114

Make sure the http.



167

00:10:26.034 --> 00:10:30.072

Ping google.com, does it work?



168

00:10:30.072 --> 00:10:31.632

Yes, yes it does work.



169

00:10:31.632 --> 00:10:33.952

What is the problem?



170

00:10:33.952 --> 00:10:36.592

Why?



171

00:10:36.592 --> 00:10:38.350

Why, Explorer, why?



172

00:10:38.350 --> 00:10:39.580

There we go.



173

00:10:39.580 --> 00:10:42.780

It is open now.



174

00:10:42.780 --> 00:10:45.180

Yeah, I just figured out
why this is happening.



175

00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:50.870

If you are performing this sort
of an attack, your victim might,



176

00:10:50.870 --> 00:10:56.030

like I have here,
might experience slight delays or



177

00:10:56.030 --> 00:11:00.720

temporary loss of connection for a couple
of seconds or something like that.



178

00:11:00.720 --> 00:11:03.330

I wouldn't call it loss
of connection completely.



179

00:11:03.330 --> 00:11:08.130

It would just be unable to load
the website from the first try,



180

00:11:08.130 --> 00:11:12.300

but, instead of giving you
the reload option here apparently



181

00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.960

it just gives you fixed
problems which it doesn't fix.



182

00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.290

If I was using Chrome or



183

00:11:16.290 --> 00:11:19.540

something like that I would just
get an option to reload the page.



184

00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:23.442

If you press reload the page
it will succeed, no problems.



185

00:11:23.442 --> 00:11:29.402

Now, my search query was Google and
on top of that it has added a word Linux.



186

00:11:29.402 --> 00:11:31.764

How does it know which words to add?



187

00:11:31.764 --> 00:11:33.084

Well, simple enough.



188

00:11:33.084 --> 00:11:36.122

We can go ahead and
modify the script ourselves.



189

00:11:36.122 --> 00:11:40.564

So I'm back in the Kali Linux machine.



190

00:11:40.564 --> 00:11:43.604

And if just do ll, whoops, ls.



191

00:11:43.604 --> 00:11:45.682

My Google search is here.



192

00:11:45.682 --> 00:11:52.244

Let me just nano google search.



193

00:11:52.244 --> 00:11:53.204

Excellent.



194

00:11:53.204 --> 00:11:55.482

So, it says extra text.



195

00:11:55.482 --> 00:11:58.042

Extra text is Linux.



196

00:11:58.042 --> 00:12:01.804

I can put whatever I want there,
it's completely irrelevant.



197

00:12:01.804 --> 00:12:05.562

I'm gonna put, what am I gonna put?



198

00:12:05.562 --> 00:12:08.202

Smurf.



199

00:12:08.202 --> 00:12:09.604

Blue.



200

00:12:09.604 --> 00:12:11.282

Black.



201

00:12:11.282 --> 00:12:12.442

Gray wall.



202

00:12:12.442 --> 00:12:16.004

I am running out of ideas.



203

00:12:16.004 --> 00:12:18.724

What am I gonna put there?



204

00:12:18.724 --> 00:12:22.122

Six.



205

00:12:22.122 --> 00:12:26.042

Let's put the number six.



206

00:12:26.042 --> 00:12:29.604

Just because I'm completely
flushed out of ideas tonight.



207

00:12:29.604 --> 00:12:33.271

Anyway, if you wish multiple words,



208

00:12:33.271 --> 00:12:37.402

you can type in +, and
I can type in seven.



209

00:12:37.402 --> 00:12:40.674

That's like super original for my side.



210

00:12:40.674 --> 00:12:41.950

I am all original tonight.



211

00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:46.430

Note that this is not
actually six plus seven.



212

00:12:46.430 --> 00:12:48.800

This is the word six and then plus seven.



213

00:12:48.800 --> 00:12:50.530

Let me just think of something else.



214

00:12:50.530 --> 00:12:52.520

Let's type in brick.



215

00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:56.573

So six+brick and then I can type in space.



216

00:12:56.573 --> 00:13:04.477

Then I can type in blackhole.



217

00:13:04.477 --> 00:13:09.042

And I can type in plus, I don't know,



218

00:13:09.042 --> 00:13:12.477

alcohol, or I don't know.



219

00:13:12.477 --> 00:13:13.100

I have no idea.



220

00:13:13.100 --> 00:13:13.990

It doesn't really matter.



221

00:13:13.990 --> 00:13:16.740

This is how you would add multiple words.



222

00:13:16.740 --> 00:13:21.004

So with a plus sign, you can add
pretty much as many words as you like.



223

00:13:21.004 --> 00:13:26.004

Eventually there is a limit somewhere
out there, but nothing meaningful.



224

00:13:26.004 --> 00:13:28.604

You can add pretty much as
many words as you like.



225

00:13:28.604 --> 00:13:30.764

I'm just gonna leave it six,
not gonna bother.



226

00:13:30.764 --> 00:13:32.404

But you can try an experiment.



227

00:13:32.404 --> 00:13:35.682

Type in different things and
see what you get, the results.



228

00:13:35.682 --> 00:13:41.082

Don't give it too long of a string
because it might not work.



229

00:13:41.082 --> 00:13:44.482

Anyway, Windows 8.



230

00:13:44.482 --> 00:13:46.404

Oh, wait, I need to reset.



231

00:13:46.404 --> 00:13:49.592

And remember, once you change
the configuration files, or



232

00:13:49.592 --> 00:13:53.157

pretty much anything related to
the configuration files from which



233

00:13:53.157 --> 00:13:56.534

the configuration file takes something,
such as this script,



234

00:13:56.534 --> 00:13:59.242

because the configuration
is taking this script.



235

00:13:59.242 --> 00:14:01.162

You need to restart the service.



236

00:14:01.162 --> 00:14:09.884

So service squid3 restart.



237

00:14:09.884 --> 00:14:15.824

Notice that also my ARP spoofing
is going on in the background and



238

00:14:15.824 --> 00:14:23.310

I can just reset the squid proxy without
pausing the ARP spoofing process at all.



239

00:14:23.310 --> 00:14:24.907

I'm not gonna do anything to it.



240

00:14:24.907 --> 00:14:26.055

I'm not gonna touch it.



241

00:14:26.055 --> 00:14:29.600

I'm just gonna leave it running while
the squid proxy is actually resetting.



242

00:14:31.630 --> 00:14:32.860

And, I don't know.



243

00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:36.924

Last time, it took maybe 30 seconds,
something like that.



244

00:14:36.924 --> 00:14:40.060

This time, hopefully, it's gonna take
a bit of a shorter amount of time.



245

00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:41.620

And there we go.



246

00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.570

It's done, complete.



247

00:14:43.570 --> 00:14:47.360

Let's go over to Windows 8.



248

00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:52.670

I'm gonna close this, and
let's perform a web search.



249

00:14:52.670 --> 00:14:55.740

Why are giving me fix connection?



250

00:14:55.740 --> 00:14:57.564

Just reload the page.



251

00:14:57.564 --> 00:14:58.324

And there we go.



252

00:14:58.324 --> 00:15:03.190

Once you like press just Ctrl+R, once you
actually reload the page, it's gonna work.



253

00:15:03.190 --> 00:15:05.010

So you see, it says Google and
then it says six.



254

00:15:07.090 --> 00:15:09.090

Anyway, that would be it.



255

00:15:09.090 --> 00:15:11.510

Before I wrap this tutorial up,



256

00:15:11.510 --> 00:15:16.380

please let me urge you all to
experiment as much as you can.



257

00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:18.930

Try all the other scripts
that you can find.



258

00:15:18.930 --> 00:15:23.714

But please, and I mean please,
do not just download



259

00:15:23.714 --> 00:15:28.192

a script from a random
link somewhere on the net.



260

00:15:28.192 --> 00:15:30.072

Don't do that.



261

00:15:30.072 --> 00:15:32.832

You have seen where I found the script,
where I have downloaded it.



262

00:15:32.832 --> 00:15:35.354

I mean, you can find the script elsewhere,
that's not a problem.



263

00:15:35.354 --> 00:15:40.217

But be very specific as far as
the places from which you download



264

00:15:40.217 --> 00:15:42.432

the scripts are concerned.



265

00:15:42.432 --> 00:15:46.825

So as you've seen, I've downloaded it from
Google Code, which is pretty safe, and



266

00:15:46.825 --> 00:15:50.192

plus I can actually read the script and
see what's written in it.



267

00:15:50.192 --> 00:15:53.211

And you can in such a way be safer, but



268

00:15:53.211 --> 00:15:58.290

if you can't read the script it
doesn't really do much good.



269

00:15:58.290 --> 00:15:59.786

Anyway, I am urging you once again,



270

00:15:59.786 --> 00:16:01.970

be very careful from where
you download the scripts.



271

00:16:01.970 --> 00:16:04.920

But please do experiment as well.



272

00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.700

Try, try a lot of other varieties.



273

00:16:07.710 --> 00:16:12.292

One more thing to say is that
browsers are getting updated.



274

00:16:12.292 --> 00:16:15.088

There are security precautions
which are being put in place, so



275

00:16:15.088 --> 00:16:16.450

not all the scripts will work.



276

00:16:18.770 --> 00:16:23.100

This attack won't work forever, and
it won't work on all machines, and



277

00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.220

it won't work against anyone.



278

00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.820

So please keep that in
mind when attempting this.



279

00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:33.270

Usually best to go against somebody
who doesn't have the latest updates.



280

00:16:33.270 --> 00:16:35.180

But that's a pretty general sentence, and



281

00:16:35.180 --> 00:16:39.240

you might think that that is such a far
fetched idea that that's impossible.



282

00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.690

But let me tell you something.



283

00:16:40.690 --> 00:16:43.510

Most people don't have the latest updates.



284

00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:47.840

They don't have the latest software.



285

00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:49.700

There are multiple reasons for that.



286

00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.230

Sometimes it's money, but most of
the time it's just that people are lazy.



287

00:16:54.230 --> 00:16:58.703

They don't perform regular updates and
even though it cost them literally



288

00:16:58.703 --> 00:17:02.974

nothing, maybe like five minutes of
their time or something of a kind.



289

00:17:02.974 --> 00:17:07.452

Another thing is that people
are using operating systems for



290

00:17:07.452 --> 00:17:10.452

which the security support has ran out.



291

00:17:10.452 --> 00:17:14.031

So there are no more security updates for
those operating systems,



292

00:17:14.031 --> 00:17:15.170

which is fantastic.



293

00:17:16.580 --> 00:17:20.630

And you might think that I'm talking
about Windows XP or something of a kind.



294

00:17:20.630 --> 00:17:22.320

No, I'm not talking about Windows XP.



295

00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:26.790

If you're using Windows XP your machine
is practically public property.



296

00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.630

Primarily because there are a lot
of people out there scanning for



297

00:17:30.630 --> 00:17:36.030

those machines as they are extremely
vulnerable to all sorts of attacks.



298

00:17:36.030 --> 00:17:39.080

But I'm talking more about, for
example, let's say Windows 7.



299

00:17:39.080 --> 00:17:45.838

Security support still hasn't ran out but
they're not exactly enthusiastic about it.



300

00:17:45.838 --> 00:17:50.920

Windows 8.1 is fairly good with security
but it still has some loopholes,



301

00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:55.390

and if not updated on a regular
basis it can encounter problems.



302

00:17:55.390 --> 00:17:58.930

And even if it is upgraded,
I mean my system here, it's upgraded.



303

00:18:00.430 --> 00:18:03.000

This red flag that you see at the bottom.



304

00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.210

This is not the updates, this is just
telling me turn something on for



305

00:18:07.210 --> 00:18:08.420

Windows that I don't want to turn on.



306

00:18:08.420 --> 00:18:13.322

I think it's the Windows default firewall
or antivirus or something of a kind.



307

00:18:13.322 --> 00:18:18.102

Anyway, that being said I wish
to bid you all farewell and



308

00:18:18.102 --> 00:18:21.300

I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
