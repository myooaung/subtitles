00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello everybody and welcome to this
tutorial today.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,359
Today I will go ahead download Kali Linux

3
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,719
and demonstrate the installation procedure as well

4
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,500
within a virtual environment.

5
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:18,400
So first off, go ahead open up your browser.

6
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,500
Type in Kali Linux.

7
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:23,279
Press "Enter"

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,300
Navigate over to their website.

9
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:31,000
So its www.kali.org

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:32,400
It's HTTPS

11
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:34,400
Don't forget to check that.

12
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:39,200
Go ahead and navigate over to downloads.

13
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,600
Let me just go ahead and zoom in here.

14
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:42,100
Excellent

15
00:00:42,100 --> 00:00:46,500
So here you have images -- It says "Kali Linux 64 bit"

16
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:50,200
You can have a direct ISO download.

17
00:00:50,200 --> 00:00:54,500
Download of an ISO file, or you can go over to the torrents

18
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,640
and download it from there.

19
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,180
Now Kali Linux, the among tools that it has

20
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:03,789
and that come pre-installed

21
00:01:03,789 --> 00:01:07,800
is fairly massive for a Linux distro

22
00:01:07,800 --> 00:01:11,840
I mean, its 3 gigabytes, which is huge.

23
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,900
Yeah, the download of 3 gigabytes

24
00:01:15,900 --> 00:01:17,800
it's not just gonna fly like that.

25
00:01:17,800 --> 00:01:18,930
Well, it maybe it will

26
00:01:18,930 --> 00:01:21,800
I don't know what sort of a connection to you have

27
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,340
but for the sake of this tutorial

28
00:01:23,340 --> 00:01:25,300
I have downloaded it, prior to this

29
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:29,759
so we don't have to go over that through procedure here.

30
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,900
Basically waiting for the download itself to happen.

31
00:01:32,900 --> 00:01:35,300
What you want case you didn't do it

32
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,500
you can just go ahead and click on "ISO"

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,500
Click here "Save"

34
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:40,600
Click "Okay"

35
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:43,700
and download procedure will begin.

36
00:01:43,700 --> 00:01:46,500
It will be displayed here in the upper right corner.

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,000
So you see it reports an hour and 20 minutes.

38
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:53,300
Just gonna go ahead and stop that because I don't want that happening

39
00:01:53,300 --> 00:01:55,400
and then you have the torrent version
as well.

40
00:01:55,400 --> 00:01:58,000
So you can just click on "torrents"

41
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,170
Save  file

42
00:01:59,170 --> 00:02:03,130
Open up what is displayed here

43
00:02:03,130 --> 00:02:07,530
and it should open up transmission at some point of time

44
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,600
Just go ahead and try that again

45
00:02:11,600 --> 00:02:14,920
Yep, there we go.

46
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:16,400
So it has a few files here

47
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:18,800
and just go ahead and click "open"

48
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,100
and it's gonna start the download process.

49
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,600
This might be a bit of a faster option, depending on the status of seeders

50
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:29,500
but it's really up to you.

51
00:02:29,500 --> 00:02:30,410
You can't really go wrong

52
00:02:30,410 --> 00:02:33,520
especially if you have a faster internet
connection.

53
00:02:33,520 --> 00:02:37,170
It will not matter that much to you.

54
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:40,250
Let me just go ahead and close the browser.

55
00:02:40,250 --> 00:02:44,540
Now I need to go ahead navigate over to my start menu

56
00:02:44,540 --> 00:02:48,190
and type in VirtualBox

57
00:02:48,190 --> 00:02:53,800
and as soon as you type start typing, it gives you the list of options.

58
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,500
So just go ahead and take this one.

59
00:02:56,500 --> 00:02:59,500
You might wanna pin it to a taskbar or something like that

60
00:02:59,500 --> 00:03:04,200
like I have pinned it to my left panel.

61
00:03:04,200 --> 00:03:05,700
Open up VirtualBox.

62
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:06,300
Excellent

63
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:09,100
So I have few machines set up here.

64
00:03:09,100 --> 00:03:12,800
Here, you can see I have like 1-2-3-4-5

65
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,800
I have five virtual machines set up.

66
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:17,500
I can't them all at the same time because...

67
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,100
well, maybe I could if I reduce the amount of resources

68
00:03:20,100 --> 00:03:23,400
that I allot to each one of them

69
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:25,100
but I will not do that now.

70
00:03:25,100 --> 00:03:30,000
For the time being, I want to install a brand new Kali Linux

71
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,300
Before I can do that, I need to do a bit of a configuration.

72
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:36,200
So first off, before the installation procedure starts

73
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,250
or anything of a kind

74
00:03:37,250 --> 00:03:43,000
I need to create a new environment in which this machine will be installed.

75
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:47,000
So go ahead and click on "new"

76
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:49,500
Type in whatever name you wish.

77
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:51,870
I'm just going type in "Kali"

78
00:03:51,870 --> 00:03:56,000
So I know that it's a Kali Linux

79
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,090
because I have a lot of other virtual machines here

80
00:03:58,090 --> 00:04:00,500
but you can name it whatever you want.

81
00:04:00,500 --> 00:04:04,100
The choice is entirely up to you.

82
00:04:04,100 --> 00:04:06,600
Type -- It's obviously not Microsoft Windows.

83
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:11,330
It's Linux and it's not Ubuntu 64

84
00:04:11,330 --> 00:04:14,460
but since it's based on Debian

85
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,190
I suppose I could type in Debian 64.

86
00:04:18,190 --> 00:04:21,000
Debian 64 bit here.

87
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:23,100
Not sure if they have Kali.

88
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,880
Probably not.

89
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:26,500
There we go -- They do not have it.

90
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:27,100
It doesn't matter.

91
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:31,000
If you type in version Debian 64 bit, this is going to work.

92
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,200
No problems.

93
00:04:33,200 --> 00:04:35,000
Just click "next" -- that's it.

94
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:39,240
Here you will allot the amount of RAM that you wanted to have

95
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:42,370
Now, its not RAM intensive.

96
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:45,400
It should work fine, as it is by default

97
00:04:45,400 --> 00:04:50,200
but I just have a habit of allotting it above one gigabyte.

98
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:55,300
For the sake of this tutorial, I will allot it to two gigabytes of RAM

99
00:04:55,300 --> 00:05:00,200
primarily because we will be working with some of the programs

100
00:05:00,200 --> 00:05:01,400
that can be demanding

101
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:03,490
and it can be resource intensive.

102
00:05:03,490 --> 00:05:06,400
So I want to do this.

103
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,000
Don't worry about it if you given it too much RAM or too little RAM

104
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,400
You can always change this later on.

105
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:15,960
This is very flexible

106
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:17,900
That's the beauty of VirtualBox.

107
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,000
That's why I like it so much.

108
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,400
You can change these at any point of time

109
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:26,800
if you deemed that you need the resources elsewhere

110
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,430
or you have more resources that you can allot here.

111
00:05:29,430 --> 00:05:32,600
So just click "next"

112
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:35,000
Just go ahead click "create"

113
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:36,800
Create a virtual hard drive.

114
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,230
Now that is the drive this machine will be using

115
00:05:40,230 --> 00:05:43,520
and just use this one -- VDI VirtualBox.

116
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,500
Disk image -- that's the hard drive file type.

117
00:05:46,500 --> 00:05:47,510
Click "next"

118
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:52,500
Dynamically allocated -- that's very
important

119
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:53,630
and you can see

120
00:05:53,630 --> 00:05:56,600
you can read here you what "Dynamically allocated" means.

121
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,000
Basically, it is hard drive file will use space in your physical hard drive

122
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:03,700
as it fields up.

123
00:06:03,700 --> 00:06:08,400
Up to the maximum fixed size and

124
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:10,000
and click "next"

125
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:12,800
Here you will allot dry space.

126
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,300
Now, I have a lot of dry space, so I'm just going to go ahead

127
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:22,410
and allot, like maybe, 120 gigs.

128
00:06:22,410 --> 00:06:26,000
That's gonna be more than enough for this undertaking

129
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,400
since I do have a lot of dry space in my laptop

130
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,400
I don't really care

131
00:06:29,400 --> 00:06:32,700
but if you don't have enough dry space or something like that

132
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:36,300
you can go ahead and allot 50 gigabytes or something like that

133
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:38,000
It should work fine, no problems.

134
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:43,000
720 is more than I need. Way more.

135
00:06:43,000 --> 00:06:45,600
Just go ahead and click "create"

136
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,600
That's it.

137
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,000
Now we have our Kali

138
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,800
and now we have our environment, under the name "Kali" set up.

139
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:56,170
There is just one more thing that we need to do.

140
00:06:56,170 --> 00:06:59,480
We need to configure the boot order for this machine

141
00:06:59,480 --> 00:07:01,400
and maybe not the boot order

142
00:07:01,400 --> 00:07:06,000
but rather instead, the location of the ISO file

143
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:07,230
which it will pull.

144
00:07:07,230 --> 00:07:10,000
So go ahead and right click on it.

145
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:10,840
"Settings"

146
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:13,000
"Display"

147
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:13,500
"Storage"

148
00:07:13,500 --> 00:07:16,600
Click on "Storage"

149
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:17,920
Click on "Empty"

150
00:07:17,920 --> 00:07:20,700
There's this disc icon here.

151
00:07:20,700 --> 00:07:25,800
When you click on it, it says "choose a virtual CD disk file"

152
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:27,810
So I have a few here

153
00:07:27,810 --> 00:07:31,300
but none of these are what I actually need.

154
00:07:31,300 --> 00:07:33,200
If you have something in your cd-rom drive

155
00:07:33,200 --> 00:07:36,000
you can just go ahead and click here

156
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:38,070
and it's gonna pull an image from a CD

157
00:07:38,070 --> 00:07:40,500
but that's not really the case here.

158
00:07:40,500 --> 00:07:42,600
We have an ISO file that we want to use.

159
00:07:42,600 --> 00:07:44,500
So just go ahead and open it up.

160
00:07:44,500 --> 00:07:47,500
Click on "Home"

161
00:07:47,500 --> 00:07:51,400
and I have it in my downloads folder.

162
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:52,680
It should be around here somewhere.

163
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:53,500
Yup, there we go!

164
00:07:53,500 --> 00:07:58,200
Kali Linux 1.0.9a-amd64

165
00:07:58,200 --> 00:08:01,140
I do believe that I'm slightly behind the latest version

166
00:08:01,140 --> 00:08:04,200
but we're gonna fix that with updates, no problems.

167
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:05,200
Open it up it

168
00:08:05,200 --> 00:08:09,200
It says "Kali Linux 1.0.9a-amd64.iso"

169
00:08:09,200 --> 00:08:12,900
and that is the type of file that we're looking for - ".iso"

170
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,900
Open it up. There you go.

171
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,200
It's now inserted.

172
00:08:17,200 --> 00:08:20,700
You can see it here -- The blue marcation in the center.

173
00:08:20,700 --> 00:08:24,100
It's marked and Kali Linux is in the tree.

174
00:08:24,100 --> 00:08:26,100
So click "OK"

175
00:08:26,100 --> 00:08:28,100
Double click on "Kali"

176
00:08:28,100 --> 00:08:30,700
and it says "Starting"

177
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,200
Now it's running.

178
00:08:32,200 --> 00:08:37,000
You have a few options here to utilize.

179
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:40,500
You can have Live (amd64)

180
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,100
Live (forensic mode)

181
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,200
USB Persistence

182
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:46,100
Live USB Encryted Persistence

183
00:08:46,100 --> 00:08:48,170
or just go ahead and install it.

184
00:08:48,170 --> 00:08:50,600
So what these options are:

185
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:57,600
You have "Live", which is basically when it runs from the USB stick

186
00:08:57,600 --> 00:08:59,100
or something like that.

187
00:08:59,100 --> 00:09:05,000
Those are just live boots -- Can be USB, CDs, or something of a kind

188
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:08,400
where the system is booted from an external device

189
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,300
and that is what people usually do

190
00:09:11,300 --> 00:09:14,610
when they want to access certain services

191
00:09:14,610 --> 00:09:17,500
which are protected by the current
operating system.

192
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,830
So when you bring it down

193
00:09:18,830 --> 00:09:21,830
and when you plug in your USB

194
00:09:21,830 --> 00:09:24,700
and boot the system from the USB stick

195
00:09:24,700 --> 00:09:29,390
your system will not recognize any file
permissions previously set

196
00:09:29,390 --> 00:09:32,710
by the system that was installed there
on the hard drive

197
00:09:32,710 --> 00:09:35,100
or the machine, because it is down

198
00:09:35,100 --> 00:09:39,400
and then you can, I don't know, then you can delete stuff

199
00:09:39,400 --> 00:09:42,000
that the system will not allow you to delete.

200
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,500
This is one of the ways that people had used

201
00:09:44,500 --> 00:09:47,650
to actually delete Internet Explorer in
Windows.

202
00:09:47,650 --> 00:09:50,500
More as a joke than anything els

203
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,110
Just to prove that it's possible

204
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:59,000
and this is also one of the ways in which you can pull password files

205
00:09:59,000 --> 00:09:59,790
in Windows

206
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:02,100
and the decrypt them as well.

207
00:10:02,100 --> 00:10:06,300
So will deal with that a bit later on when we get into advanced stuff

208
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:07,990
but you have fail-safe mode

209
00:10:07,990 --> 00:10:09,200
Live fail-safe mode

210
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:14,300
Well, every system pretty much has a fails-afe mode today

211
00:10:14,300 --> 00:10:19,800
It's basic boot and it tries to

212
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,779
it just slows the basic things

213
00:10:21,779 --> 00:10:24,300
and this is practically guaranteed to boot

214
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:25,900
every time you boot in fail-safe mode

215
00:10:25,900 --> 00:10:28,100
unless you messed something up

216
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:33,000
that is in a very very very very serious way.

217
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:35,940
Fail-safe mode will boot almost always.

218
00:10:35,940 --> 00:10:41,200
Forensic mode for investigators and such people.

219
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:44,600
We're not going to be dealing with it in this fashion

220
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:46,000
because we don't want the live.

221
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:47,750
We want the installed version

222
00:10:47,750 --> 00:10:52,100
and then you have Live USB Persistence.

223
00:10:52,100 --> 00:10:54,740
So this is a very nice feature that you can have.

224
00:10:54,740 --> 00:10:57,430
For example, you can have an operating system.

225
00:10:57,430 --> 00:11:01,200
Kali Linux or many other distros
installed on a USB stick

226
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:03,589
and you can have a rather large USB
stick

227
00:11:03,589 --> 00:11:07,130
like, I don't know, 256 gigs or something a kind.

228
00:11:07,130 --> 00:11:08,800
It doesn't need to be that big

229
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:10,000
It can be a lot smaller

230
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,740
but the bigger the better, primarily because of this persistence flag.

231
00:11:13,750 --> 00:11:17,639
You can work and work

232
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:22,800
and all your work will be saved on that
USB hard drive.

233
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,500
So you can make permanent changes to a live CD.

234
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,000
Well, generally not to a CD.

235
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:32,800
This is a USB.

236
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,040
I do believe that there is a way of
doing this for the CD as well

237
00:11:36,040 --> 00:11:38,000
but nobody does that anymore.

238
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,000
Just have a USB stick and you'll be fine.

239
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:43,560
You see, the first version

240
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:44,900
the live one

241
00:11:44,900 --> 00:11:46,200
it means when you take it out

242
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:47,610
when you shut it down

243
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:50,370
it will forget any and all changes made
to it

244
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:53,620
but when you have Live USB with persistence

245
00:11:53,620 --> 00:11:56,500
you can  have those changes remembered.

246
00:11:56,500 --> 00:11:57,500
You can break them down.

247
00:11:57,500 --> 00:12:01,400
So next time you boot it, they will load

248
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:04,100
and here you have another great option --

249
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:08,200
It's Live USB Encrypted Persistence.

250
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,500
So what this means is basically that your old information

251
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:18,100
contained on your live USB will be encrypted

252
00:12:18,100 --> 00:12:19,980
and if you happen to lose it

253
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,000
nobody will be able to access your data.

254
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:25,500
So provided of course, that you have something sensitive there

255
00:12:25,500 --> 00:12:26,680
worth protecting

256
00:12:26,680 --> 00:12:31,000
and I mean you would still lose the data

257
00:12:31,000 --> 00:12:37,100
but you would ensure that no one can actually access it

258
00:12:37,100 --> 00:12:38,300
or anything of a kind.

259
00:12:38,300 --> 00:12:39,000
So if you lose it

260
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:42,000
If you have some passwords or something like that stored there

261
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:43,400
Oh well, no big deal.

262
00:12:43,400 --> 00:12:45,200
You know, it's encrypted.

263
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:46,900
Nobody's gonna be able to break it

264
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:48,389
provided of course that you have a long enough encryption key

265
00:12:48,389 --> 00:12:53,400
the long enough encryption key.

266
00:12:53,400 --> 00:12:56,100
In any case, in the follow up tutorial

267
00:12:56,100 --> 00:13:00,500
I will go ahead and proceed with the installation.

268
00:13:00,500 --> 00:13:03,400
Notice that we will need to install a few more things

269
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,400
because, look at this --

270
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:07,459
I'm resizing the screen now

271
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:10,700
and once I go past a certain size

272
00:13:10,700 --> 00:13:13,879
I can no longer increase the size of my screen

273
00:13:13,879 --> 00:13:15,900
of my virtual screen.

274
00:13:15,900 --> 00:13:18,600
Rather instead, I'm just increasing it's edges

275
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:20,600
and that is because we need

276
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,200
something called guest additions for VirtualBox.

277
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:28,610
Guest additions enable full screen displays of virtual machines

278
00:13:28,610 --> 00:13:32,000
but more of that to come in the next tutorial

279
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:34,400
and I hope I'll see you all there.
