00:00:00.030 --> 00:00:03.000

Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.200

Today I am going to open up a chapter on brute forcing methods, I would say.



3

00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:14.000

Here I will include how to crack hashes



4

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.800

how you can actually attack a website with brute force



5

00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.000

How we can perform a brute force attack on a website



6

00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000

in order to try to guess the combination of usernames and passwords



7

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.000

but more importantly



8

00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:32.200

you do need to know that there is a way to crack those hashes



9

00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:33.489

and how you can crack them.



10

00:00:33.489 --> 00:00:35.400

So basically I will go over a couple of tools



11

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.500

One of them will be findmyhash, which is online tool



12

00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:41.050

Another one, which is extremely popular



13

00:00:41.050 --> 00:00:42.200

it's called John the Ripper



14

00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:43.700

and then we'll jump into hydra



15

00:00:43.700 --> 00:00:49.600

which actually enables you to attempt multiple usernames and passwords



16

00:00:49.600 --> 00:00:52.300

on a website



17

00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:53.800

and in such a way brute force them.



18

00:00:53.800 --> 00:00:56.900

If it manages to guess them, you will login.



19

00:00:56.900 --> 00:01:00.800

Although it does require some rather painful parameters



20

00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:03.000

so we'll see how that goes.



21

00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.200

It can be a drag with parameters sometimes



22

00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:07.600

because you need to figure them out



23

00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.200

but usually everybody pretty much get the hang of it



24

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:13.500

they tried a couple of times and eventually it works out.



25

00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:20.300

Fortunately for us, the very first tool that I'm going to try today is rather simple.



26

00:01:20.300 --> 00:01:25.000

Plain text, plain tool, and it's called findmyhash



27

00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000

"findmyhash --help



28

00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.500

You will see even the Help menu doesn't have that many options.



29

00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:32.400

So these are examples



30

00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.900

These valid options



31

00:01:33.900 --> 00:01:34.600

Look at this --



32

00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:37.500

So it only has three valid options.



33

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.219

It says "If your hash cannot be cracked



34

00:01:39.219 --> 00:01:43.009

...search it in Google and show all the results"



35

00:01:43.009 --> 00:01:50.500

"Note: This option ONLY works with -h ( one hash input) option"



36

00:01:50.500 --> 00:01:52.600

F for files



37

00:01:52.600 --> 00:01:54.800

You can have a file of hashes.



38

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:57.740

So there are a few things to take into consideration



39

00:01:57.740 --> 00:02:00.400

when creating a file of different hashes.



40

00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:03.990

So it says "one hash per line"



41

00:02:03.990 --> 00:02:07.000

Nothing in between, so you type one hash and press ENTER



42

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000

You copy/paste the next one and press ENTER



43

00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.550

and so on and so forth



44

00:02:10.550 --> 00:02:13.900

and all of them have to be of the same type.



45

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:15.570

Up above straight from the beginning



46

00:02:15.570 --> 00:02:19.000

you have types of hashes which are supported.



47

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:24.500

So MD4, MD5, GOST, SHA512



48

00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:25.800

and so on and so forth.



49

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.000

So these are the ones that are supported



50

00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:31.200

Any other, I'm afraid it's not going to work with this program.



51

00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:35.000

Here you have the general syntax



52

00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.400

and the general syntax...



53

00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:40.500

You can disregard this portion of the syntax.



54

00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:41.500

You don't need to type this in.



55

00:02:41.500 --> 00:02:43.200

You can just type in findmyhash



56

00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.000

and then the rest.



57

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:47.000

Let's just go down



58

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000

Excellent



59

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.800

Clear the screen



60

00:02:49.800 --> 00:02:52.000

Also, another thing to take into consideration



61

00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:54.000

that you have a lot of websites out there



62

00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.200

which you can use to attempt to decrypt your stuff.



63

00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:01.800

Here I'm using like MD5lab.com



64

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:08.410

and I have requested that it decrypts a certain hash.



65

00:03:08.410 --> 00:03:15.000

The hash that I've actually asked it to decrypt is "hey223!!"



66

00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:17.600

and this is it



67

00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:21.000

Now it's highly unlikely that you will be able to decrypt this



68

00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.200

on your local computer



69

00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:27.000

primarily because it contains three sets of...



70

00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.800

Rather you have letters, you have numbers



71

00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:33.300

and then you have these signs as well, which is an exclamation mark.



72

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.400

If it was hey223, you'd probably break it



73

00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:41.200

but with exclamation marks, it's gonna be a bit more difficult.



74

00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.200

Anyway, I'm just gonna Control C this.



75

00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:49.500

I want to save to see if it actually manages to finish later



76

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:54.000

so I can show you



77

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.400

because you should always remember that you have a lot of resources



78

00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:02.000

out there on the net that you can utilize and those machines



79

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.500

and those machines are probably a lot faster than your local machines



80

00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:06.580

as they are server machines



81

00:04:06.580 --> 00:04:09.800

So if you can find something for free, great!



82

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:14.000

If you can't, oh well.



83

00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:24.000

Anyway, let's go and type in "findmyhash"



84

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:29.000

and we're gonna say it's gonna be MD5, as this is a really common one.



85

00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.900

I do believe that this is the one used in the database



86

00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:34.500

that we've previously cracked.



87

00:04:34.500 --> 00:04:37.600

So if you extract hashes, such as those from a database



88

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:42.800

you can crack them in this fashion



89

00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:47.500

"-h" for hash, and then we need to go ahead and create a hash.



90

00:04:47.500 --> 00:04:49.300

I don't know...What are we gonna type in here?



91

00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:51.600

Let's use something simple to begin with



92

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:54.430

and then later we can use more complex things



93

00:04:54.430 --> 00:04:56.800

but I want to primarily use something simple now



94

00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:59.500

so that it finishes in some reasonable amount of time



95

00:04:59.500 --> 00:05:04.800

as opposed to having to wait for an hour or something like that.



96

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.400

So let's just type on "hey" --  That's quite simple



97

00:05:08.400 --> 00:05:09.800

and we'll try...



98

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.300

Let's just leave this one works out and then we can try another one.



99

00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:16.900

This one should go relatively fast



100

00:05:16.900 --> 00:05:17.600

and there we go.



101

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.200

It is analyzing it with different things.



102

00:05:21.200 --> 00:05:26.500

Going straight through, you can see the sights here as well.



103

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:29.000

So it's going it's going it's going...and it's done



104

00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.200

so the following hashes were cracked



105

00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:38.200

This is so weird...Somebody didn't bother to put a statement somewhere



106

00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:39.500

but oh well, the tool is free



107

00:05:39.500 --> 00:05:43.000

so my credits to the authors of the tool



108

00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:47.200

but a single statement could actually fix this.



109

00:05:47.200 --> 00:05:53.000

If you have a single hash, it should be written "hash was cracked"



110

00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.639

If you have multiple hashes, it can say "The following hashes were cracked"



111

00:05:56.639 --> 00:05:59.000

Anyway, that's really doesn't matter.



112

00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.600

It has no effect to the functioning of our tool



113

00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:06.000

and you can see surely enough, there's a hash here



114

00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000

and you can see the word, that was hash as well



115

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:11.400

so no big deal there.



116

00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.600

Let's try something a bit more complex.



117

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.300

Is this done? Uh, no



118

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:19.200

It's probably not gonna finish, but anyway, what the hell



119

00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.700

I might as well try 123



120

00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:25.300

Let's try hey123



121

00:06:25.300 --> 00:06:30.290

So letters and numbers, and increased length as well



122

00:06:30.290 --> 00:06:34.200

Paste, press ENTER



123

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.300

and it's going.



124

00:06:38.300 --> 00:06:40.000

This might take a bit longer



125

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:41.760

However, I just wanna show you...



126

00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:46.000

if it becomes too long before I actually finish what I have to say



127

00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:51.400

if it continues after I've said what I wanted to say, I'm gonna stop it



128

00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:52.100

but no



129

00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.400

Apparently no



130

00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:59.300

So a six character password including numbers and digits is cracked.



131

00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:03.500

Let's just try one more for the fun of it.



132

00:07:03.500 --> 00:07:08.500

So, hey123



133

00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:09.800

I don't know, let's leave 123



134

00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:17.300

Let's just increase this to hey in capital letters and let's add an exclamation mark.



135

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:20.000

I purely doubt that it is gonna be able to crack this.



136

00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.200

Maybe because I used hey and 123



137

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:25.000

but let's see



138

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:31.100

If it does crack it, I'm going to be amazed



139

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:34.300

because just adding those those strange characters



140

00:07:34.300 --> 00:07:37.400

that you generally don't see in passwords or usernames



141

00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:44.000

like exclamation marks, asterisk signs, greater than, less than, etc.



142

00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:51.900

You really make it a lot more difficult for any sort of brute forcing software



143

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:55.200

to actually crack it, primarily because...



144

00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.000

Okay, so if you have letters and numbers



145

00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:06.000

you have a fixed amount of characters.



146

00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.400

It's a smaller number and if you use characters



147

00:08:10.400 --> 00:08:16.800

oh man, that increases the amount of possible combinations exponentially



148

00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:22.700

because, I don't know, you have like 10 possible numbers



149

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.600

and then you have the English alphabet



150

00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:30.300

but if you have all these numbers and all these other signs



151

00:08:30.300 --> 00:08:35.300

like quotation marks, single quotation marks, double quotation marks



152

00:08:35.300 --> 00:08:42.200

parentheses, brackets, curly brackets, percentages and percent signs



153

00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.800

slashes back, slashes pipes...



154

00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.200

Yeah, the amount of combinations is staggering



155

00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:53.300

and yeah. it's unlikely it will be cracked.



156

00:08:53.300 --> 00:08:56.200

Just like with this one that we're doing now



157

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:57.600

we are unable to crack it.



158

00:08:57.600 --> 00:09:00.300

Even though it's fairly simple



159

00:09:00.300 --> 00:09:02.600

it just has an exclamation mark here



160

00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.000

but people, as I've said



161

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.800

generally,  in a significant amount of cases, definitely about 50%



162

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:17.000

do not use these sort of marcations in their passwords



163

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000

primarily because it's hard to remember



164

00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.200

and a lot of people don't tend to log in these days into anything.



165

00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.400

They just stay logged in, or Firefox remembers their passwords



166

00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.300

or Chrome or whatever



167

00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:31.000

and they don't want such passwords.



168

00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000

I mean, this exclamation mark is not a general thing, trust me.



169

00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:40.570

People generally don't put it hey123



170

00:09:40.570 --> 00:09:42.100

and that's gonna cracked



171

00:09:42.100 --> 00:09:46.160

but in any case, it looks like it won't actually manage to crack it.



172

00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:51.600

If it does, I will let you guys know, but I purely doubt that it will.



173

00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:55.200

I do believe that this is usually the last one that runs



174

00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:58.200

but in any case, I want to bid you farewell



175

00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:04.200

and in the next tutorial, we will actually use some other tools



176

00:10:04.200 --> 00:10:05.800

I do believe it's gonna be John the Ripper.



177

00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:07.000

Okay, so there we go



178

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.500

It wasn't actually cracked.



179

00:10:10.500 --> 00:10:12.700

Yeah, it can't actually crack this one



180

00:10:12.700 --> 00:10:27.000

but let's see if we can so some Google searching with it.



181

00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:43.000

Let's see...How does the syntax for this one go?



182

00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000

"Google doesn't have any results. Sorry!"



183

00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.300

So yeah, you're not going to be able to crack this hash



184

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.600

but what you can do is basically copy it.



185

00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.500

There's one more thing that I've done here



186

00:10:58.500 --> 00:11:02.400

but here's what you can do as well to duplicate the procedure .



187

00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:03.800

Just copy it here



188

00:11:03.800 --> 00:11:09.259

Let's see what Google has to say for real



189

00:11:09.259 --> 00:11:13.200

There's MD5decoder.org



190

00:11:13.200 --> 00:11:20.000

and that seems to be the only site with this particular hash



191

00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000

and this is in some foreign language



192

00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.049

but it doesn't really matter.



193

00:11:24.049 --> 00:11:28.500

Hashes are universal in all languages, apparently.



194

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.300

Nope, this is not where we need to be



195

00:11:31.300 --> 00:11:35.500

but if you have a website like MD5lab.com



196

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.800

you can copy/paste it there.



197

00:11:37.800 --> 00:11:39.600

I can't copy/paste it actually here now



198

00:11:39.600 --> 00:11:42.500

because there's this cracking process underway



199

00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:45.900

but if you are using this site for the first time



200

00:11:45.900 --> 00:11:48.000

you're going to get a prompt here.



201

00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:50.500

Just copy/paste the hash and click on decrypt



202

00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:54.200

Maybe they will have more luck than you.



203

00:11:54.200 --> 00:11:55.800

Anyway, in the follow-up tutorial



204

00:11:55.800 --> 00:12:00.200

as I said, we'll try out some other tools and see how our luck serves us there.



205

00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:03.420

Until then, I bid you farewell and I hope to see you there.
