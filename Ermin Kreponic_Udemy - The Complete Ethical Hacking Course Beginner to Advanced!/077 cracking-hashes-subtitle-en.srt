00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:09,200
Today I am going to open up a chapter on brute forcing methods, I would say.

3
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:14,000
Here I will include how to crack hashes

4
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,800
how you can actually attack a website with brute force

5
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,000
How we can perform a brute force attack on a website

6
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,000
in order to try to guess the combination of usernames and passwords

7
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,000
but more importantly

8
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,200
you do need to know that there is a way to crack those hashes

9
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:33,489
and how you can crack them.

10
00:00:33,489 --> 00:00:35,400
So basically I will go over a couple of tools

11
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:38,500
One of them will be findmyhash, which is online tool

12
00:00:38,500 --> 00:00:41,050
Another one, which is extremely popular

13
00:00:41,050 --> 00:00:42,200
it's called John the Ripper

14
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,700
and then we'll jump into hydra

15
00:00:43,700 --> 00:00:49,600
which actually enables you to attempt multiple usernames and passwords

16
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,300
on a website

17
00:00:52,300 --> 00:00:53,800
and in such a way brute force them.

18
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:56,900
If it manages to guess them, you will login.

19
00:00:56,900 --> 00:01:00,800
Although it does require some rather painful parameters

20
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:03,000
so we'll see how that goes.

21
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,200
It can be a drag with parameters sometimes

22
00:01:05,200 --> 00:01:07,600
because you need to figure them out

23
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:10,200
but usually everybody pretty much get the hang of it

24
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:13,500
they tried a couple of times and eventually it works out.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:20,300
Fortunately for us, the very first tool that I'm going to try today is rather simple.

26
00:01:20,300 --> 00:01:25,000
Plain text, plain tool, and it's called findmyhash

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:29,000
"findmyhash --help

28
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:31,500
You will see even the Help menu doesn't have that many options.

29
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:32,400
So these are examples

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,900
These valid options

31
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:34,600
Look at this --

32
00:01:34,600 --> 00:01:37,500
So it only has three valid options.

33
00:01:37,500 --> 00:01:39,219
It says "If your hash cannot be cracked

34
00:01:39,219 --> 00:01:43,009
...search it in Google and show all the results"

35
00:01:43,009 --> 00:01:50,500
"Note: This option ONLY works with -h ( one hash input) option"

36
00:01:50,500 --> 00:01:52,600
F for files

37
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:54,800
You can have a file of hashes.

38
00:01:54,800 --> 00:01:57,740
So there are a few things to take into consideration

39
00:01:57,740 --> 00:02:00,400
when creating a file of different hashes.

40
00:02:00,400 --> 00:02:03,990
So it says "one hash per line"

41
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:07,000
Nothing in between, so you type one hash and press ENTER

42
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:09,000
You copy/paste the next one and press ENTER

43
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:10,550
and so on and so forth

44
00:02:10,550 --> 00:02:13,900
and all of them have to be of the same type.

45
00:02:13,900 --> 00:02:15,570
Up above straight from the beginning

46
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:19,000
you have types of hashes which are supported.

47
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:24,500
So MD4, MD5, GOST, SHA512

48
00:02:24,500 --> 00:02:25,800
and so on and so forth.

49
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:28,000
So these are the ones that are supported

50
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,200
Any other, I'm afraid it's not going to work with this program.

51
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,000
Here you have the general syntax

52
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,400
and the general syntax...

53
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:40,500
You can disregard this portion of the syntax.

54
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:41,500
You don't need to type this in.

55
00:02:41,500 --> 00:02:43,200
You can just type in findmyhash

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:45,000
and then the rest.

57
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:47,000
Let's just go down

58
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:48,000
Excellent

59
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:49,800
Clear the screen

60
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:52,000
Also, another thing to take into consideration

61
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:54,000
that you have a lot of websites out there

62
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,200
which you can use to attempt to decrypt your stuff.

63
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,800
Here I'm using like MD5lab.com

64
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:08,410
and I have requested that it decrypts a certain hash.

65
00:03:08,410 --> 00:03:15,000
The hash that I've actually asked it to decrypt is "hey223!!"

66
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:17,600
and this is it

67
00:03:17,600 --> 00:03:21,000
Now it's highly unlikely that you will be able to decrypt this

68
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:23,200
on your local computer

69
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,000
primarily because it contains three sets of...

70
00:03:27,000 --> 00:03:29,800
Rather you have letters, you have numbers

71
00:03:29,800 --> 00:03:33,300
and then you have these signs as well, which is an exclamation mark.

72
00:03:33,300 --> 00:03:35,400
If it was hey223, you'd probably break it

73
00:03:35,400 --> 00:03:41,200
but with exclamation marks, it's gonna be a bit more difficult.

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,200
Anyway, I'm just gonna Control C this.

75
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,500
I want to save to see if it actually manages to finish later

76
00:03:49,500 --> 00:03:54,000
so I can show you

77
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,400
because you should always remember that you have a lot of resources

78
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,000
out there on the net that you can utilize and those machines

79
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:05,500
and those machines are probably a lot faster than your local machines

80
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:06,580
as they are server machines

81
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:09,800
So if you can find something for free, great!

82
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:14,000
If you can't, oh well.

83
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:24,000
Anyway, let's go and type in "findmyhash"

84
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,000
and we're gonna say it's gonna be MD5, as this is a really common one.

85
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:32,900
I do believe that this is the one used in the database

86
00:04:32,900 --> 00:04:34,500
that we've previously cracked.

87
00:04:34,500 --> 00:04:37,600
So if you extract hashes, such as those from a database

88
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,800
you can crack them in this fashion

89
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:47,500
"-h" for hash, and then we need to go ahead and create a hash.

90
00:04:47,500 --> 00:04:49,300
I don't know...What are we gonna type in here?

91
00:04:49,300 --> 00:04:51,600
Let's use something simple to begin with

92
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,430
and then later we can use more complex things

93
00:04:54,430 --> 00:04:56,800
but I want to primarily use something simple now

94
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,500
so that it finishes in some reasonable amount of time

95
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:04,800
as opposed to having to wait for an hour or something like that.

96
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:08,400
So let's just type on "hey" --  That's quite simple

97
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,800
and we'll try...

98
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:13,300
Let's just leave this one works out and then we can try another one.

99
00:05:13,300 --> 00:05:16,900
This one should go relatively fast

100
00:05:16,900 --> 00:05:17,600
and there we go.

101
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,200
It is analyzing it with different things.

102
00:05:21,200 --> 00:05:26,500
Going straight through, you can see the sights here as well.

103
00:05:26,500 --> 00:05:29,000
So it's going it's going it's going...and it's done

104
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:31,200
so the following hashes were cracked

105
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,200
This is so weird...Somebody didn't bother to put a statement somewhere

106
00:05:38,200 --> 00:05:39,500
but oh well, the tool is free

107
00:05:39,500 --> 00:05:43,000
so my credits to the authors of the tool

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:47,200
but a single statement could actually fix this.

109
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:53,000
If you have a single hash, it should be written "hash was cracked"

110
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:56,639
If you have multiple hashes, it can say "The following hashes were cracked"

111
00:05:56,639 --> 00:05:59,000
Anyway, that's really doesn't matter.

112
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:02,600
It has no effect to the functioning of our tool

113
00:06:02,600 --> 00:06:06,000
and you can see surely enough, there's a hash here

114
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,000
and you can see the word, that was hash as well

115
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:11,400
so no big deal there.

116
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:13,600
Let's try something a bit more complex.

117
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,300
Is this done? Uh, no

118
00:06:16,300 --> 00:06:19,200
It's probably not gonna finish, but anyway, what the hell

119
00:06:19,200 --> 00:06:22,700
I might as well try 123

120
00:06:22,700 --> 00:06:25,300
Let's try hey123

121
00:06:25,300 --> 00:06:30,290
So letters and numbers, and increased length as well

122
00:06:30,290 --> 00:06:34,200
Paste, press ENTER

123
00:06:34,200 --> 00:06:38,300
and it's going.

124
00:06:38,300 --> 00:06:40,000
This might take a bit longer

125
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:41,760
However, I just wanna show you...

126
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,000
if it becomes too long before I actually finish what I have to say

127
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,400
if it continues after I've said what I wanted to say, I'm gonna stop it

128
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:52,100
but no

129
00:06:52,100 --> 00:06:53,400
Apparently no

130
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:59,300
So a six character password including numbers and digits is cracked.

131
00:06:59,300 --> 00:07:03,500
Let's just try one more for the fun of it.

132
00:07:03,500 --> 00:07:08,500
So, hey123

133
00:07:08,500 --> 00:07:09,800
I don't know, let's leave 123

134
00:07:09,800 --> 00:07:17,300
Let's just increase this to hey in capital letters and let's add an exclamation mark.

135
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,000
I purely doubt that it is gonna be able to crack this.

136
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,200
Maybe because I used hey and 123

137
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:25,000
but let's see

138
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,100
If it does crack it, I'm going to be amazed

139
00:07:31,100 --> 00:07:34,300
because just adding those those strange characters

140
00:07:34,300 --> 00:07:37,400
that you generally don't see in passwords or usernames

141
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:44,000
like exclamation marks, asterisk signs, greater than, less than, etc.

142
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:51,900
You really make it a lot more difficult for any sort of brute forcing software

143
00:07:51,900 --> 00:07:55,200
to actually crack it, primarily because...

144
00:07:55,200 --> 00:07:58,000
Okay, so if you have letters and numbers

145
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:06,000
you have a fixed amount of characters.

146
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:10,400
It's a smaller number and if you use characters

147
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,800
oh man, that increases the amount of possible combinations exponentially

148
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,700
because, I don't know, you have like 10 possible numbers

149
00:08:22,700 --> 00:08:26,600
and then you have the English alphabet

150
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:30,300
but if you have all these numbers and all these other signs

151
00:08:30,300 --> 00:08:35,300
like quotation marks, single quotation marks, double quotation marks

152
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:42,200
parentheses, brackets, curly brackets, percentages and percent signs

153
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:44,800
slashes back, slashes pipes...

154
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,200
Yeah, the amount of combinations is staggering

155
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:53,300
and yeah. it's unlikely it will be cracked.

156
00:08:53,300 --> 00:08:56,200
Just like with this one that we're doing now

157
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:57,600
we are unable to crack it.

158
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,300
Even though it's fairly simple

159
00:09:00,300 --> 00:09:02,600
it just has an exclamation mark here

160
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:05,000
but people, as I've said

161
00:09:05,000 --> 00:09:10,800
generally,  in a significant amount of cases, definitely about 50%

162
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:17,000
do not use these sort of marcations in their passwords

163
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,000
primarily because it's hard to remember

164
00:09:21,000 --> 00:09:24,200
and a lot of people don't tend to log in these days into anything.

165
00:09:24,200 --> 00:09:27,400
They just stay logged in, or Firefox remembers their passwords

166
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:29,300
or Chrome or whatever

167
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:31,000
and they don't want such passwords.

168
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:37,000
I mean, this exclamation mark is not a general thing, trust me.

169
00:09:37,000 --> 00:09:40,570
People generally don't put it hey123

170
00:09:40,570 --> 00:09:42,100
and that's gonna cracked

171
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:46,160
but in any case, it looks like it won't actually manage to crack it.

172
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,600
If it does, I will let you guys know, but I purely doubt that it will.

173
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,200
I do believe that this is usually the last one that runs

174
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,200
but in any case, I want to bid you farewell

175
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:04,200
and in the next tutorial, we will actually use some other tools

176
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:05,800
I do believe it's gonna be John the Ripper.

177
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:07,000
Okay, so there we go

178
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:10,500
It wasn't actually cracked.

179
00:10:10,500 --> 00:10:12,700
Yeah, it can't actually crack this one

180
00:10:12,700 --> 00:10:27,000
but let's see if we can so some Google searching with it.

181
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:43,000
Let's see...How does the syntax for this one go?

182
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:47,000
"Google doesn't have any results. Sorry!"

183
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:51,300
So yeah, you're not going to be able to crack this hash

184
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,600
but what you can do is basically copy it.

185
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:58,500
There's one more thing that I've done here

186
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,400
but here's what you can do as well to duplicate the procedure .

187
00:11:02,400 --> 00:11:03,800
Just copy it here

188
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,259
Let's see what Google has to say for real

189
00:11:09,259 --> 00:11:13,200
There's MD5decoder.org

190
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:20,000
and that seems to be the only site with this particular hash

191
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:22,000
and this is in some foreign language

192
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,049
but it doesn't really matter.

193
00:11:24,049 --> 00:11:28,500
Hashes are universal in all languages, apparently.

194
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:31,300
Nope, this is not where we need to be

195
00:11:31,300 --> 00:11:35,500
but if you have a website like MD5lab.com

196
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:37,800
you can copy/paste it there.

197
00:11:37,800 --> 00:11:39,600
I can't copy/paste it actually here now

198
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:42,500
because there's this cracking process underway

199
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:45,900
but if you are using this site for the first time

200
00:11:45,900 --> 00:11:48,000
you're going to get a prompt here.

201
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,500
Just copy/paste the hash and click on decrypt

202
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:54,200
Maybe they will have more luck than you.

203
00:11:54,200 --> 00:11:55,800
Anyway, in the follow-up tutorial

204
00:11:55,800 --> 00:12:00,200
as I said, we'll try out some other tools and see how our luck serves us there.

205
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:03,420
Until then, I bid you farewell and I hope to see you there.
