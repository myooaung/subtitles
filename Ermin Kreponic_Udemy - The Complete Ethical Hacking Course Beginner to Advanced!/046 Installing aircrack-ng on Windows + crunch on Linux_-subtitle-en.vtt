00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400

Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:07.600

Today I will show you briefly how you can install aircrack in Windows.



3

00:00:07.600 --> 00:00:10.500

So go ahead and start up your windows



4

00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:15.299

but this is not a good idea, just gonna go ahead and say it out of the box.



5

00:00:15.299 --> 00:00:18.200

Not something you actually want to do.



6

00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:21.500

So I already have it installed here and this is how it looks like.



7

00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.100

I'm just gonna go ahead and close it to show you what you need to.



8

00:00:24.100 --> 00:00:33.900

First off, you need to go ahead and go to the website called www.aircrack-ng.org and download the file



9

00:00:33.900 --> 00:00:35.800

and that's pretty much it.



10

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:40.800

After you download it, unzip it and it will work.



11

00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.000

So let's just go ahead and click on it. It's right there.



12

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.200

I'm gonna use my unzipping program, so it's 7 zip.



13

00:00:48.200 --> 00:00:51.000

It doesn't belong to me, it's just one that I have chosen to use



14

00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.400

but you can use WinRAR



15

00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:56.449

or pretty much anything else that you have available.



16

00:00:56.449 --> 00:01:02.500

I'm gonna go ahead and select aircrack -ng ,extract it, select the folder to extract it



17

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:07.500

I'm gonna say desktop. I have already extracted it twice there.



18

00:01:07.500 --> 00:01:09.200

Yes to all. Copy over it.



19

00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:12.800

It's not going to ask you this question because you're not going to have it there



20

00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:14.010

and there we go.



21

00:01:14.010 --> 00:01:16.500

It is successfully extracted to desktop.



22

00:01:16.500 --> 00:01:19.850

As I said previously, there is no installation procedure whatsoever.



23

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:22.200

This is the folder that I am moving about.



24

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:29.400

Just go ahead and open it, select bin, and it says aircrack -ng gui/exit



25

00:01:29.400 --> 00:01:31.000

That is the one that you need.



26

00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000

Excellent



27

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.200

and here we have the tool works, it's right here.



28

00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:36.700

You don't need to install anything.



29

00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:40.000

You didn't need to go through a lengthy procedures or anything of the kind.



30

00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.439

You have three programs here...



31

00:01:41.439 --> 00:01:49.000

You actually have four of them, but we're not going to be using these two for the time being.



32

00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.300

You have airdump -ng and aircrack -ng



33

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:55.100

airdump is used for collecting information



34

00:01:55.100 --> 00:02:01.900

and you use aircrack -ng in order to brute force the password



35

00:02:01.900 --> 00:02:04.600

or brute force the encryption, should Isay.



36

00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.000

Now as I said, I do not recommended this.



37

00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.300

If you really wish to use Windows, here is how you can do it.



38

00:02:10.300 --> 00:02:11.760

Here's how you can use it.



39

00:02:11.760 --> 00:02:16.800

Other than that, I really really don't recommend it.



40

00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:20.000

and now we're going to switch back to our Linux



41

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.620

and here we will see what else do we need.



42

00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:25.200

So one of the primary problems that we will encounter



43

00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:31.000

is the fact that we were unable to generate vast amount of passwords manually, of course.



44

00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.920

Ever try typing in a million passwords manually? Not gonna work.



45

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.300

So one of the first things that we need here is our crunch



46

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:48.400

which is a piece of code, a software, which we will use in order to generate password lists.



47

00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.400

It's very flexible and easy to use.



48

00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:56.400

We can state how many characters



49

00:02:56.400 --> 00:03:02.200

do we want our passwords to have from what link to what link



50

00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.300

is the possibilities like minimal and maximal length of the password



51

00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:08.000

and if we know fractions of the password



52

00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.500

we can even use those fractions and insert them.



53

00:03:11.500 --> 00:03:16.500

Before we can do any of those things, we first need to go and download crunch.



54

00:03:16.500 --> 00:03:19.600

Crunch is available on sourceforge.net



55

00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.900

Just type in "crunch password generator"



56

00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:30.800

and here, we will get the link for SourceForge



57

00:03:30.800 --> 00:03:31.500

Excellent



58

00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:35.000

Just go ahead and download this.



59

00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:42.000

Your download will start in few seconds, and the whole download process will last a few seconds.



60

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.370

Just go ahead and save the file.



61

00:03:44.370 --> 00:03:47.000

Let's just open it up.



62

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.700

We will need to extract it.



63

00:03:48.700 --> 00:03:51.500

Just use a default extractor, it's as simple as that.



64

00:03:51.500 --> 00:03:52.300

Choose a folder



65

00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.000

I'm gonna go ahead and pick desktop



66

00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.300

primarily because I'm gonna delete it later, as I already have it installed and configured.



67

00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:01.400

There we go. That's done.



68

00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:06.600

It finishes up really fast. You don't even have the time to see what's going on.



69

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:08.940

So let's just go ahead and close these things.



70

00:04:08.940 --> 00:04:09.800

Excellent



71

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:11.200

So crunch is here.



72

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:17.300

If I opt to open it, there are some things in here which we will attempt to use later

on



73

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:20.100

but I will explain them once we actually start using them.



74

00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.000

For the time being, I just wanted to show you how to install it.



75

00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:30.200

Let's go ahead and open up our terminal, navigate over to the folder where it is located



76

00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:34.900

So "cd /home/Chronic/Desktop/crunch"



77

00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:37.010

Excellent



78

00:04:37.010 --> 00:04:41.400

You don't have an instruction here on how to do it, but you see there is a Makefile



79

00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.200

and whenever there's a Makefile, just have in "make"



80

00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:50.900

You do need to be root or have a psuedo password.



81

00:04:50.900 --> 00:04:51.870

So just type in "make"



82

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:53.000

Excellent



83

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.400

There we go That has passed.



84

00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.250

"make install" press ENTER again, and there we go.



85

00:04:59.250 --> 00:05:12.000

You have the installation process done and ready to go.



86

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.180

Crunch now installed.



87

00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:17.600

you can see the main pages for it are functional



88

00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.370

and this is the syntax.



89

00:05:19.370 --> 00:05:22.300

You would type in one number here and another number here.



90

00:05:22.300 --> 00:05:25.000

The minimal and maximal length.



91

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.700

Character set here



92

00:05:26.700 --> 00:05:29.400

You could type them in manually or use predefined ones



93

00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.500

then you can pass a ton load of other options if you wish.



94

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.700

You don't need to actually read through all of this, but skim through it.



95

00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.000

Just scroll through it.



96

00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.000

See what parts you can catch and see it they are of any use to you



97

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:52.000

but I assure you in the later tutorials



98

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.510

as we will be using crunch, for example, in this fashion.



99

00:05:55.510 --> 00:06:01.000

So let me just go ahead clear the screen, type in "crunch"



100

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:09.000

and then I will tell it to generate a certain length, let's say from three to nine.



101

00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000

I've seen people taken from zero to like nine.



102

00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:16.200

So you can exclude zero immediately, but it doesn't do any harm



103

00:06:16.200 --> 00:06:18.000

It doesn't actually take away that much time.



104

00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:23.000

Let's just type in from three to, I don't know, five



105

00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:31.270

and now I can pass in, I'm gonna say "abcd123"



106

00:06:31.270 --> 00:06:41.500

and now I can pipe this to "aircrack -ng"



107

00:06:41.500 --> 00:06:48.000

and all the passwords that are generated here will be passed to aircrack -ng and will be used immediately.



108

00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000

I need add a few more commands here, of course, and that I will do in the next tutorial



109

00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.500

but I just anted to explain the significance of this



110

00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.310

because let's say I do this --



111

00:06:57.310 --> 00:07:03.000

3 to 5, press ENTER, and I'm gonna cancel it before it manages to finish.



112

00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:10.200

It says "Crunch will now generate the following amount of data:  7680 bytes aids"



113

00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:11.500

That's nothing



114

00:07:11.500 --> 00:07:18.000

It says this is the amount of passwords is going to generate -- 1344



115

00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:18.900

Not a big deal



116

00:07:18.900 --> 00:07:22.000

Okay, let's try something else.



117

00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:37.200

Let's try "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", press ENTER



118

00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.200

Look at what happens --



119

00:07:39.200 --> 00:07:47.000

The file size has grown exponentially, the amount of possible combinations have grown exponentially



120

00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:49.200

and it says 1770 MB



121

00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:51.110

But this is a very small password.



122

00:07:51.110 --> 00:07:53.200

This is gonna get cracked in a couple of seconds.



123

00:07:53.200 --> 00:07:56.000

This is no big deal.



124

00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:02.000

How about if I specify the length of nine?



125

00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:08.600

Just look at what happens -- It says that it has 51 TB of data



126

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.000

and this is how many possible combinations there will be.



127

00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:15.100

Okay, this is a very large number



128

00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:19.800

and with my CPU, it will take me a very long amount of time to do that



129

00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:24.000

but not a reasonable amount of time, in any case.



130

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.670

It says 51 TB -- That's a lot



131

00:08:26.670 --> 00:08:35.430

Okay, let's go ahead and type in "1234567890" and see what happens.



132

00:08:35.430 --> 00:08:44.400

It says almost 1000 TB from 51, just by adding numbers from 0 to 9



133

00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:48.300

You get where I'm doing with this



134

00:08:48.300 --> 00:08:55.000

but let's say that I type in here, I don't know, 29



135

00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:03.000

Basically it tells me that will generate 6998 PB of data.



136

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000

You are simply not gonna have enough room on your hard drives.



137

00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.800

It doesn't really matter how big they are.



138

00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:14.300

You're not going to have a single PB of storage in your house



139

00:09:14.300 --> 00:09:24.000

A PB of storage is 1000 TB, so that's a lot and you're not gonna have it in your house.



140

00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000

You see, what you would do with aircrack generally is...



141

00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:29.600

I'm just gonna explain why this is important



142

00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:33.000

"aircrack -ng -w"



143

00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:40.000

and then you would passwordlist.txt file to it



144

00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000

in order to crack a certain file with it.



145

00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:49.300

However, these password lists, as long as they are as good as they are



146

00:09:49.300 --> 00:09:54.000

they do not guarantee that the password will be cracked



147

00:09:54.000 --> 00:10:00.800

and you cannot generate this amount of information with this many combinations



148

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.000

and put them in a file on your local computer



149

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000

and if you put it in a cloud somewhere, it's going to cost a ridiculous amount of money



150

00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:16.000

What you can do, however, is pass an argument -- "-w -"



151

00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:29.200

and I'm just gonna use my previous command -- "aircrack -ng -w -"



152

00:10:29.200 --> 00:10:30.400

Excellent



153

00:10:30.400 --> 00:10:34.000

So now, crunch will not save these things.



154

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.800

They will simply go to standard output



155

00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.800

and aircrack will pick them up from standard output and utilize them



156

00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:48.900

in order to basically break the encryption of a capture file



157

00:10:48.900 --> 00:10:51.300

that we will later on capture as well.



158

00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.530

So this was just an example, a post installation example



159

00:10:54.530 --> 00:10:59.000

and explanation of why we needed to install crunch.



160

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.600

There's also way...I've seen it somewhere in the net



161

00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:07.800

but I haven't managed to find a safe place to download crunch for Windows from the net



162

00:11:07.800 --> 00:11:11.000

therefore I have opted not to actually show you that



163

00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:13.500

due to safety reasons



164

00:11:13.500 --> 00:11:16.400

but it is possible to do it in Windows.



165

00:11:16.400 --> 00:11:20.200

Again, not recommended at all.



166

00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:24.000

In any case, I bid you farewell until the next tutorial.



167

00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.500

In the next tutorial, I will start with the cracking process



168

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:34.000

and you will see how we can actually crack a genuine wifi.
