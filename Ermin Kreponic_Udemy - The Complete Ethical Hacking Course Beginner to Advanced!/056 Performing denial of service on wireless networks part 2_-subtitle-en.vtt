00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000

Hello everybody and welcome to visit tutorial.



2

00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.300

Today I will do as I promised in the previous one.



3

00:00:07.300 --> 00:00:13.000

We will do a bit of scripting and we will see how that works to our advantage.



4

00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:16.500

Now a client might try to hide



5

00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:23.700

so if you wish to some sort of a long-term wireless denial of service attack



6

00:00:23.700 --> 00:00:25.700

you will want to be vigilant.



7

00:00:25.700 --> 00:00:27.800

You will need to monitor the status of the network



8

00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.200

You will need to see when the MAC addresses are changed



9

00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:33.800

when the ESSIDs are changed



10

00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:36.239

when channels are changed, and so on and so forth.



11

00:00:36.239 --> 00:00:39.400

Now these things, you can do to manually.



12

00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.100

You can do them with scripts.



13

00:00:41.100 --> 00:00:43.000

The choice is entirely yours.



14

00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.800

I can't go into bash scripting here, because that would be a course for itself



15

00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:52.600

but I will show you some of the basics and what you can do with bash scripts.



16

00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:55.900

I mean, they're very powerful.



17

00:00:55.900 --> 00:00:57.200

You can do a lot with them.



18

00:00:57.200 --> 00:00:59.800

You can automate most of your tasks



19

00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.219

and on top of that, we need to see how we can deauthenticate particular clients



20

00:01:03.219 --> 00:01:04.800

on the network.



21

00:01:04.800 --> 00:01:07.200

So I didn't change anything.



22

00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.700

So I'm still in monitor mode, if I'm not mistaken.



23

00:01:09.700 --> 00:01:11.800

So I'm just gonna go ahead from the previous tutorial, that is.



24

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:20.000

I'm just gonna go ahead and type in "airodump -ng wlp2s0"



25

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:23.000

and then I press this.



26

00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.200

I have my network here, so I'm just gonna go ahead and take its MAC addresses



27

00:01:27.200 --> 00:01:30.500

and I want to do a more precise scan



28

00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.600

So here's what I will do --



29

00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:37.600

I'll do "airodump -ng --BSSID"



30

00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:42.000

which will be the MAC address of this of this access point



31

00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.500

and I can also specify a channel with "--channel"



32

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.500

but I don't really want to do that.



33

00:01:47.500 --> 00:01:50.250

I just want to scan for this MAC address and see.



34

00:01:50.250 --> 00:01:55.000

That way I'll  know if the channel changes.



35

00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.850

The scan is now in progress.



36

00:01:57.850 --> 00:02:02.100

At some point of time, I'm sure I'll get a client here or something of a kind.



37

00:02:02.100 --> 00:02:05.600

Let me just deauthenticate it and deauthenticate it in my cell phone.



38

00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:11.000

I'm just gonna turn wireless on and off and then I should get the signal



39

00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000

because there is no activity.



40

00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:14.190

If I was browsing the net on my phone or something like that



41

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:17.000

It would show it immediately, but I have not doing anything



42

00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.200

and there we go.



43

00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:22.440

Simple authentication will show transition of packets



44

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:28.200

between the BSSID of 90:F6:52:C1:BB:18



45

00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.320

and the station is basically a device



46

00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.000

which is connected to that particular access point



47

00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000

Now I will go ahead and stop this here



48

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.300

and before I continue, you can see in the upper left corner



49

00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:44.000

it says channel 6



50

00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.940

and you have seen that these channels changed



51

00:02:45.940 --> 00:02:50.500

I mean, it's been going from 1 to 14 if I'm not mistaken



52

00:02:50.500 --> 00:02:54.700

and when these channels here change



53

00:02:54.700 --> 00:03:00.400

your wireless network card is put into these functions



54

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:04.500

in accordance with these channels, and functions on these frequencies.



55

00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.190

So that might disrupt it, and for a DoS attack



56

00:03:08.190 --> 00:03:11.600

you might need to manually reconfigure your wireless network card.



57

00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.400

As I've showed you before, just use iwconfig



58

00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:18.500

and set it to whatever channel you want.



59

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:20.700

Anyway, client, as I said



60

00:03:20.700 --> 00:03:23.000

can change the MAC address



61

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000

it can change the BSSID



62

00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:27.700

it can change even the encryption method



63

00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:29.400

and can change the channel.



64

00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:34.000

So how can you know for sure if somebody changes all three of these



65

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.200

if somebody changed the channel of the MAC address and the BSSID



66

00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:42.000

how can you figure out what access point are you going to continue DoS'ing



67

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.700

because you might have like a hundred of them of something of a kind



68

00:03:44.700 --> 00:03:50.500

that you captured with this airodump -ng packet



69

00:03:50.500 --> 00:03:51.700

how will you figure it out?



70

00:03:51.700 --> 00:03:52.900

Well, simple



71

00:03:52.900 --> 00:04:01.500

Same clients will be authenticated with the same networks.



72

00:04:01.500 --> 00:04:04.570

So even if the BSSID name changes



73

00:04:04.570 --> 00:04:15.000

even if I can change it something 1,2,3,4,5 or whatever



74

00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000

all of these parameters change the clients



75

00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.700

which are authenticated to that access point



76

00:04:20.700 --> 00:04:22.500

will not change.



77

00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.500

I suppose theoretically, somebody could go ahead



78

00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:29.200

and change the MAC addresses of every single device



79

00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:31.200

connected to that access point taxes point



80

00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.200

but think of the following scenario --



81

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.600

You're a company or you're in a coffee shop or something like that



82

00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:44.200

you cannot go around changing everybody's MAC addresses



83

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.800

on everybody's devices.



84

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:47.000

No way



85

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.380

So the first time around



86

00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:52.000

see which clients are authenticated to a particular access point



87

00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:58.000

and then do a general airodump-ng like this



88

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:04.200

Do a general sweep like this



89

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.000

and then you will see the authenticated clients down below.



90

00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.900

You will be able to see down below



91

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.780

who are the clients that are authenticated to that particular network



92

00:05:17.780 --> 00:05:21.440

and in such a way, you will figure out the new MAC address



93

00:05:21.440 --> 00:05:25.000

and the new channel, the newest BSSID



94

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.400

and the DoS attack will be able to proceed.



95

00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:29.600

So as I said before, there really is no stopping it



96

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.800

there is only hiding from it.



97

00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:33.500

So just go ahead and clear



98

00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.800

and I have a very nice bash script here, which I want to show you.



99

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:41.900

Well, it's not very nice but it does the job



100

00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:45.440

So this is a bash script



101

00:05:45.440 --> 00:05:47.600

and this is an infinite loop.



102

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.400

It will perform until I cancel it manually as a user.



103

00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:56.200

So let's just go briefly over it it.



104

00:05:56.200 --> 00:05:59.800

It says "aireplay -ng  -0 5"



105

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:04.000

So I want to send five deauthentication signals...packets



106

00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.500

and then "-a" to this MAC address from this interface.



107

00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:12.900

Next up, Windows 5



108

00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.800

the authentication packets have been sent.



109

00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.200

I want you to bring the interface down.



110

00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.900

So go ahead and bring the interface down.



111

00:06:21.900 --> 00:06:23.600

Use MAC changer



112

00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:27.500

Change the MAC address of the interface to random.



113

00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:31.300

So randomly change MAC addresses of my wireless interface.



114

00:06:31.300 --> 00:06:40.000

Just print out the "New Mac" so I know that something is happening



115

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.800

and then I want you to reconfigure the mode of the wireless interface



116

00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:48.700

to monitor again.



117

00:06:48.700 --> 00:06:50.500

Bring it back up



118

00:06:50.500 --> 00:06:56.000

Tell me that the mode is monitor when you grep it, in order to confirm it.



119

00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:59.000

Go ahead and sleep for three seconds.



120

00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000

While your sleeping, echo waiting



121

00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000

I don't know, I just wrote this down for some strange reason.



122

00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.200

Anyway, what you can modify here



123

00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:12.200

you can modify the sleep timer



124

00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:17.800

so you can go to sleep for relatively larger shorter periods of time



125

00:07:17.800 --> 00:07:21.900

depending on how you wish to perform this DoS attack.



126

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:30.400

Over here, you can read values from a file



127

00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.570

where you have a list of access points



128

00:07:33.570 --> 00:07:37.000

which to jam at particular time intervals.



129

00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.800

That's a bit more of a complex bash scripting method



130

00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:46.400

If you're interested, feel free to pose it in the question sections



131

00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.900

but you do need to have a certain knowledge of bash in order to do that.



132

00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.900

In any case, there are some of the things that I would like you to try



133

00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:58.000

and play around with.



134

00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.700

If you succeed, good



135

00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.000

If not, feel free to post it in the question sections.



136

00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:05.200

I will be more than happy to help you out.



137

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:10.300

Anyway, as I said, you can have a list of MAC addresses here



138

00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.400

that is loaded from some file that you previously created



139

00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:22.700

and you can jam particular wireless access points in certain time intervals.



140

00:08:22.700 --> 00:08:26.200

When you do that, you will also need a command down below



141

00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:30.200

in order to change to the appropriate channel



142

00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.000

because you will also need to know the channels of those access points.



143

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:40.000

So "iwconfig wlp2s0 channel"



144

00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:50.000

and then you will need to specify a channel name here, so 7 or 3 or 1



145

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.400

Excellent



146

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:53.500

So not a bad idea.



147

00:08:53.500 --> 00:08:58.160

You can increase the effectiveness of your wireless jamming.



148

00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:03.000

You can effectively basically jam your entire neighborhood



149

00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.500

which I definitely do not recommend, as that is illegal



150

00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:08.910

but people have been known to do it.



151

00:09:08.910 --> 00:09:13.800

I mean, somebody somewhere figures out how to do it



152

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:17.000

and is genius enough to actually attempt it.



153

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000

There's literally no gain in it.



154

00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.200

It's just annoying to the neighbors, I suppose



155

00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:27.780

but anyway, as I said, you can change the time intervals.



156

00:09:27.780 --> 00:09:30.800

That's not a bad idea at all



157

00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:33.800

Feel free to play around with this as much as you want



158

00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:37.400

with this part here in the loop



159

00:09:37.400 --> 00:09:40.300

and if you come up with any new ideas or something of a kind



160

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:43.800

feel free to post them in the discussion section.



161

00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:46.500

I will be more than happy to take a look at it



162

00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:49.200

and see what you have done on your own



163

00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:54.230

because that is really one of the best ways you can learn something.



164

00:09:54.230 --> 00:09:58.530

Anyway, let's just go ahead and apply the script and see what happens.



165

00:09:58.530 --> 00:10:01.300

No, I do not wish to save any changes.



166

00:10:01.300 --> 00:10:03.000

Anyway, before you can run a script



167

00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:13.000

you need to do "chnod +x jam.sh"



168

00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.200

and I'm just gonna type in "jam.sh"



169

00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:21.000

and see, I am again on the wrong channel



170

00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:23.000

"Waiting for beacon frame"



171

00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.360

"on channel 7"



172

00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:29.000

"wlp2s0 is on channel 7, but the AP uses channel 6"



173

00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:29.650

Excellent



174

00:10:29.650 --> 00:10:30.150

So this actually even tells you what channel is the wireless access points.



175

00:10:30.150 --> 00:10:36.500

actually even tells you one what channel is D is the wireless access points.



176

00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:45.700

So "iwconfig wlp2s0 channel 6"



177

00:10:45.700 --> 00:10:48.100

and now we can begin the jamming process.



178

00:10:48.100 --> 00:10:48.700

Excellent



179

00:10:48.700 --> 00:10:53.600

So you see here, it send five of the deauthentication attempts.



180

00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:55.400

The one that I have selected.



181

00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:57.800

and then it changes the MAC address to something.



182

00:10:57.800 --> 00:10:59.000

I don't know...unknown



183

00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:01.800

and then it brings monitor mode back up again.



184

00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.900

It says "Waiting"



185

00:11:02.900 --> 00:11:06.500

When it says waiting, it's sleeping for three seconds



186

00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.930

or something of a kind.



187

00:11:07.930 --> 00:11:09.400

Whatever you write down



188

00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:13.000

and you see the process is just going to repeat itself on end



189

00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:16.300

pretty much until you shut the computer down



190

00:11:16.300 --> 00:11:22.800

or until you terminate the process by killing the pid or just pressing CTRL C



191

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:25.600

Not a bad way to deauthenticate at all



192

00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:36.500

but there is another thing that you can do.



193

00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:38.600

So "airodump"



194

00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.500

and you can use airodump in combination with airmon



195

00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.700

but there is a trick to it.



196

00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:49.200

You have to manually configure the channel for airodump -ng



197

00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:50.700

so it doesn't change the channel.



198

00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:51.800

If it changes the channel



199

00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:55.000

your deauthentication attempts will not go through.



200

00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.800

"Channel 6", press ENTER



201

00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.400

Excellent



202

00:12:00.400 --> 00:12:02.300

Now it's permanently scanning on channel 6



203

00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:07.700

and you are able to monitor any and all changes that take place here.



204

00:12:07.700 --> 00:12:11.000

So for example, if there are some changes that take place



205

00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:13.700

you notice them and you can implement them elsewhere



206

00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:17.000

and by that, I mean if you simply lose this wireless



207

00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000

if you no longer see it



208

00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.200

perhaps the channel has been changed



209

00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:24.000

or the BSSID has been changed...



210

00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:30.710

Ha! Great. I even got the handshake here. Amazing



211

00:12:30.710 --> 00:12:35.800

Oh no...I'm not actually not even performing the deauthentication.



212

00:12:35.800 --> 00:12:37.200

I just got a handshake



213

00:12:37.200 --> 00:12:38.500

It doesn't matter



214

00:12:38.500 --> 00:12:41.000

Anyway, if you lose it



215

00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:46.840

cancel it and do a general sweep without the BSSID specified



216

00:12:46.840 --> 00:12:48.600

and without the channel specified



217

00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.590

but you can also try just with the BSSID specified



218

00:12:51.590 --> 00:12:53.200

and with the channel not specified



219

00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:55.200

because somebody could have just changed the channel



220

00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:59.700

and BSSID could have remained the same.



221

00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:09.400

and I'm gonna use the jam.sh, which starts up aireplay



222

00:13:09.400 --> 00:13:13.900

in conjunction with basically airodump.



223

00:13:13.900 --> 00:13:15.300

So I can monitor the status



224

00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:17.000

and what is going on here?



225

00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:23.200

In addition to that, I can actually jam the signal as well



226

00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:28.900

and even though it says that this station is actually deauthenticated with it



227

00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:32.330

believe me, on my android phone or whatever this is



228

00:13:32.330 --> 00:13:36.200

I would not be able to browse the internet.



229

00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:37.400

There is no way



230

00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:39.300

I would be continuously deauthenticated.



231

00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:43.000

It would be impossible for me to even open up a basic website



232

00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:47.100

That would be beyond the abilities of the device.



233

00:13:47.100 --> 00:13:49.800

As I said before, you can actually use your own phones



234

00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:52.300

you can use your own tablets or whatever other devices



235

00:13:52.300 --> 00:13:54.600

in order to confirm this



236

00:13:54.600 --> 00:14:00.200

but you can see that these tools can work parallel to each other



237

00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:01.200

no problems



238

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.000

as long as you...



239

00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.700

You cannot tell your wireless card to function on several channels at once.



240

00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.000

At least I don't know how to do that.



241

00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000

Maybe you can somewhere on the net.



242

00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.290

They definitely can be at the same time.



243

00:14:16.290 --> 00:14:18.000

They can be modulated



244

00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.720

but you cannot have them running at the same time.



245

00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:23.000

So you do need to adjust the parameters a little bit



246

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.400

and then you can use several of these tools at once.



247

00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:29.000

You can monitor the status, you can jam it



248

00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.300

you can even get a wpl2 handshake or something like that



249

00:14:34.300 --> 00:14:35.960

and it says here interface is down



250

00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.000

because I have brought it down.



251

00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:43.400

Anyway, thank you for watching



252

00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:45.900

and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.



253

00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:49.200

Until then, I bid you farewell



254

00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:53.300

and I urge you to try to do things on your own as much as you can



255

00:14:53.300 --> 00:14:57.600

as that is absolutely the best way to learn,



256

00:14:57.600 --> 00:15:01.800

Okay, so let me just do a quick show here.



257

00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:10.600

"clear" and "nano jam.sh"



258

00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:11.700

Excellent



259

00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:14.900

So instead of actually doing a general deauthentication here



260

00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:18.000

you are also able to do this



261

00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.400

So space "-c" for client



262

00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:24.100

and I'm just gonna stop this right now.



263

00:15:24.100 --> 00:15:25.209

I'm gonna take this client



264

00:15:25.209 --> 00:15:28.100

So just take the MAC address of this client



265

00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:30.700

where it says C paste it



266

00:15:30.700 --> 00:15:34.800

CTRL O to save, CTRLX to exit



267

00:15:34.800 --> 00:15:39.000

and I wish to run, jam



268

00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:40.200

Excellent



269

00:15:40.200 --> 00:15:43.800

It says "Sending 64 directed DeAuth."



270

00:15:43.800 --> 00:15:47.000

blah blah blah whatever



271

00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:51.900

This is all verbose output from the program.



272

00:15:51.900 --> 00:15:52.890

That's all that it is



273

00:15:52.890 --> 00:15:59.480

and it says which client in specific is it actually deauthenticating.



274

00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:02.000

That can be



275

00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:07.500

I'm gonna do airodump -ng channel 6



276

00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:11.200

Okay, it says "interface wlp2s0 down"



277

00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:15.100

Okay, so sometimes it's not gonna actually work out, as I said before



278

00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.000

primarily because I'm bringing the interface down



279

00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:20.600

but the scanning is actually in progress



280

00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:24.500

and even though the station might show here as actually connected



281

00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:27.000

or something of a kind



282

00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.400

try browsing the net, as I said before.



283

00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:32.510

Try doing anything with it on the internet.



284

00:16:32.510 --> 00:16:35.000

You won't be able literally to move



285

00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:37.800

because nothing will be able to pass through.



286

00:16:37.800 --> 00:16:39.600

That's gonna be a pretty big problem.



287

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:43.600

As I said before, you can confirm this with any of your devices.



288

00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.500

You won't be able to do anything with them.



289

00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:51.800

I just wanted to show you can actually jam a particular client



290

00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:54.800

You can also set the rotations here to, I don't know



291

00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:56.800

jam a particular client for awhile



292

00:16:56.800 --> 00:16:59.000

and then jam a different one for awhile



293

00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.800

Again, you can have a list of clients here



294

00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:06.179

and load them up from the files, so they can modulate.



295

00:17:06.179 --> 00:17:07.800

You're jamming this client for five minutes



296

00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:09.700

for the next five minutes, the next one



297

00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:10.900

and so on and so



298

00:17:10.900 --> 00:17:14.200

in such a way creating a bit of a chaotic situation.



299

00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:21.400

Anyway, I strongly urge you to try.



300

00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:25.200

You don't need to practice, but just try to do something on your own.



301

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:26.900

Try to alter the code



302

00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:32.000

Try to jam something you have permission to jam



303

00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.600

and try to do it in a bit of a different way.



304

00:17:34.600 --> 00:17:35.800

Apply some other arguments



305

00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:37.000

Play around with things



306

00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000

There really isn't much that you can break here



307

00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:42.000

especially if you doing it on your own wireless



308

00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000

that you have a permission to do it on



309

00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:47.740

and that is really the best possible way to learn



310

00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:52.200

but in any case gonna be you farewell now



311

00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.000

and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
