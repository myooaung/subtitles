1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:05,000
Welcome everybody to this tutorial

2
00:00:05,000 --> 00:00:08,500
This is an addition to the wireless part of the course.

3
00:00:08,500 --> 00:00:11,000
Anyway, I have noticed in the discussions

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:13,200
that a lot of people were struggling

5
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,500
Windows users were struggling with their virtualize environments

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:19,100
and they were unable to access their wireless card.

7
00:00:19,100 --> 00:00:21,300
I have mentioned this in my original course

8
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:24,010
that you won't be able to access your physical hardware

9
00:00:24,010 --> 00:00:29,000
your integrated wireless network card from your VirtualBox

10
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:34,000
You will need to either create a bootable Linux CD in order to access it

11
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:36,870
or by a USB wireless device.

12
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:39,500
Now to create a bootable CD

13
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:40,400
it's fairly simple.

14
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:44,000
Just basically burn a CD with an ISO image and boot from it

15
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,800
but getting the USB wireless adapter

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:51,600
setting it up with VirtualBox can be a little tricky

17
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,300
and I have noticed that a lot of people out there have had problems with that.

18
00:00:55,300 --> 00:00:57,090
They were unable to do it.

19
00:00:57,090 --> 00:01:01,380
That is why I have made this tutorial in as an addition to the course.

20
00:01:01,380 --> 00:01:04,640
Free addition to the course

21
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,000
in order to help you guys out

22
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:09,200
or ladies, if there are any.

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,610
I haven't noticed in the discussions, but my apologies if I have missed.

24
00:01:12,610 --> 00:01:19,000
Anyway today, you just need go and open up your browser

25
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:25,760
This is the USB wireless device that I have purchased

26
00:01:25,760 --> 00:01:32,000
It's 2000 megawatts USB alpha wireless adapter.

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
This is what you should type into your search engine

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,500
So, alpha USB 2000 megawatt network adapter

29
00:01:39,500 --> 00:01:44,000
Fairly simple as that. No problems there.

30
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:46,200
You'll be prompted with a ton load of results.

31
00:01:46,200 --> 00:01:48,200
You can purchase it from pretty much anywhere.

32
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:50,100
I personally got it from ebay

33
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,000
because it had some favorable shipping options.

34
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,200
Again, you can get it from anywhere.

35
00:01:56,200 --> 00:01:57,600
the prices are pretty much the same.

36
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,160
Have a look at different sites.

37
00:01:59,160 --> 00:02:01,500
See if you can get it a bit cheaper, or something of a kind.

38
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:04,200
It's about $28 pretty much where you look

39
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:05,680
but feel free to have a look around.

40
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,000
Anyway, depending on which version of VirtualBox have you installed

41
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:14,900
you can actually download the extension pack here.

42
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:16,220
So there's like 1 2 3

43
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:21,100
but chances are that if you have installed VirtualBox on Windows

44
00:02:21,100 --> 00:02:24,000
that you already have an extension pack.

45
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,400
Linux users have to additionally install the extension pack

46
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:30,400
because it's not open source

47
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,000
but, I mean

48
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,400
You, as a Windows user, most likely have it installed already.

49
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:40,000
If not, just go ahead and click here.

50
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,600
You'll be prompted with this one download

51
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:44,500
and it says "open with"

52
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:45,200
Press "OK"

53
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,500
By the time the download is done

54
00:02:47,500 --> 00:02:49,000
Just go ahead and click on it.

55
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:50,870
Basically just follow through the wizard.

56
00:02:50,870 --> 00:02:56,000
Keep clicking the "Next" button quite literally.

57
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:57,800
This is not my machine, by the way

58
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:00,000
I went by my friend's machine, who was running Windows  7

59
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,950
so I could actually do this tutorial on a
physical Windows machine

60
00:03:04,950 --> 00:03:07,600
but as I said, I'm not going to install it now

61
00:03:07,600 --> 00:03:09,500
because I already have it installed.

62
00:03:09,500 --> 00:03:12,090
I have installed it through the installation of VirtualBox

63
00:03:12,090 --> 00:03:14,900
and as I said, if you have installed
VirtualBox on Windows

64
00:03:14,900 --> 00:03:15,840
on any Windows

65
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:21,000
you most most likely have the extension pack installed along with it.

66
00:03:21,000 --> 00:03:24,900
If you don't, just click here and keep clicking on "Next"

67
00:03:24,900 --> 00:03:26,900
That's all that you need to do quite literally.

68
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:29,300
There is nothing special or amazing

69
00:03:29,300 --> 00:03:30,900
or anything of a kind.

70
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:33,000
The next button is your friend there.

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,100
Anyway, let's just go ahead and minimize this

72
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,300
Go ahead and unpack your USB wireless adapter.

73
00:03:43,300 --> 00:03:45,270
Take out the CD that came with it

74
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:48,400
insert it into your machine and open it
up.

75
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:50,390
So let's just go ahead and do that.

76
00:03:50,390 --> 00:03:55,900
This is the CD that I have inserted into my CD-ROM.

77
00:03:55,900 --> 00:03:58,000
Let's just go ahead and open it.

78
00:03:58,000 --> 00:03:59,200
Excellent

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,000
So now you get prompted here for a bunch of questions.

80
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:03,200
You can make a mistake here

81
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:05,200
but oh well, no big deal.

82
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:08,570
First of all, if you have bought the same devices I have

83
00:04:08,570 --> 00:04:12,120
You will click on "Indoor USB wireless"

84
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,200
You will select "Adapter series"

85
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,130
You will select the middle one

86
00:04:17,130 --> 00:04:23,000
You can read this from the bottom of your wireless USB adapter.

87
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:23,630
Click here

88
00:04:23,630 --> 00:04:26,500
and the version as well, so same place.

89
00:04:26,500 --> 00:04:28,500
Just take your wireless USB adapter

90
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,800
look at the bottom at the label

91
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,100
and there you will be able to find all this information.

92
00:04:35,100 --> 00:04:38,000
Anyway, this is the version that I am using

93
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:39,580
so I'm just gonna go ahead and click on it.

94
00:04:39,580 --> 00:04:41,900
If you're using the same as me, just go ahead and click on it.

95
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,200
If not -- if you bought a slightly different version

96
00:04:44,200 --> 00:04:45,100
just read from the bottom, that's it

97
00:04:45,100 --> 00:04:45,600
that's it

98
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,790
and this one, the CD actually comes
packaged with Mac drivers

99
00:04:49,790 --> 00:04:52,500
Windows drivers and Linux drivers, which is fantastic.

100
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:56,000
So all you Mac users, you can pretty much just insert a CD

101
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,300
and get the proper drivers for this wireless card.

102
00:04:59,300 --> 00:05:01,600
For this wireless USB adapter

103
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:04,300
Linux users if you have bought this for an extended range

104
00:05:04,300 --> 00:05:06,000
or something of a kind

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:08,100
no need for you to actually install anything

106
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,800
as it already comes prepackaged with the drivers

107
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:14,980
as does the Linux terminal already has the necessary

108
00:05:14,990 --> 00:05:18,760
to facilitate proper functioning of this device.

109
00:05:18,760 --> 00:05:21,400
Anyway, I'm gonna go ahead and click on Windows drivers.

110
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,400
Now it offers Windows XP, 7, and 8.

111
00:05:23,400 --> 00:05:26,250
There's no Vista, but for Vista if you are using it by any chance

112
00:05:26,250 --> 00:05:28,300
try the XP or Windows 7.

113
00:05:28,300 --> 00:05:30,350
One of those two is bound to work.

114
00:05:30,350 --> 00:05:34,000
I'm on Windows 7, so I'm just gonna go ahead and select Windows 7.

115
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,000
If you're on Windows 8, just select Windows 8.

116
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,520
Nothing too complex there.

117
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,800
Okay, so the installation process is starting.

118
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,000
Basically again, just click

119
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:49,000
The "Next" button is your best friend.

120
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:52,500
There's nothing fundamentally different or new that you need to do.

121
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:57,000
Just keep on clicking "Next" and installation process will finish.

122
00:05:57,000 --> 00:05:59,000
Amazing. I know right?

123
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:00,690
Nothing too complicated there.

124
00:06:00,690 --> 00:06:04,930
Just sit back, relax and let it finish its own thing

125
00:06:04,930 --> 00:06:07,300
and you should be fine.

126
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:12,600
Now upon installation, we will be required to reboot our computer

127
00:06:12,600 --> 00:06:15,110
in order for changes to take effect.

128
00:06:15,110 --> 00:06:20,000
So I'm gonna pause the tutorial there.

129
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:25,100
Anyway, it says Windows can't verify the publisher of the software.

130
00:06:25,100 --> 00:06:26,000
Oh well

131
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,700
That's one of the things you have to live with.

132
00:06:27,700 --> 00:06:29,500
It's a CD that I've gotten from them

133
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,000
so I'm guessing there's nothing unsafe on it.

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,200
Just go ahead and say "Install this driver software anyway"

135
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:39,340
This is definitely not something that you should do

136
00:06:39,340 --> 00:06:41,200
If you have downloaded from the internet

137
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:42,300
or something of a kind

138
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,000
but I have gotten the CD from the company

139
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:47,720
from the order, so it should be fine.

140
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,700
Anyway, the installation process is ongoing

141
00:06:52,700 --> 00:06:54,000
I don't know, prompting you

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:56,900
if you can hear this clicking sound from time to time

143
00:06:56,900 --> 00:07:01,500
that's basically Windows figuring out what the device is

144
00:07:01,500 --> 00:07:06,200
as the drivers are being installed.

145
00:07:06,200 --> 00:07:11,040
Anyway, I truly hope that this does help you out a great deal

146
00:07:11,040 --> 00:07:13,600
and hope you all follow through the
wireless part to the course

147
00:07:13,600 --> 00:07:14,700
without any problems

148
00:07:14,700 --> 00:07:17,800
without making a bootable CD or any such changes

149
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:19,360
for all the Windows users out there.

150
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:23,000
If you're a Mac user, you can also do pretty much the same as well.

151
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,100
If you need help figuring how to do it on Mac

152
00:07:25,100 --> 00:07:28,000
please let me know in the discussion section.

153
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,500
Here I'm just gonna say that I do want to restart my computer now

154
00:07:32,500 --> 00:07:34,800
So I'm going to pause the tutorial here

155
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,600
and I will continue when I return.

156
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:41,000
In any case, I bid you all farewell.
