00:00:00.160 --> 00:00:06.837

Okay, so we're just going to
continue from where we left off.



2

00:00:06.837 --> 00:00:09.970

Yep, I still have the terminal up and
running.



3

00:00:09.970 --> 00:00:15.628

And now we need to go onto that,
here's the address.



4

00:00:15.628 --> 00:00:17.836

Okay, so you no longer need this one.



5

00:00:17.836 --> 00:00:20.319

You just need



6

00:00:20.319 --> 00:00:29.128

http://ha.ckers.org/slowloris/.



7

00:00:29.128 --> 00:00:33.671

And you can go ahead and
visit this website.



8

00:00:33.671 --> 00:00:39.211

This is the official website for
this, exploit for this Perl script.



9

00:00:39.211 --> 00:00:42.682

There isn't that much information on it,
but



10

00:00:42.682 --> 00:00:45.797

there is enough for a script of this kind.



11

00:00:45.797 --> 00:00:51.583

I would strongly recommend that you don't
necessarily need to read through all this,



12

00:00:51.583 --> 00:00:52.461

but skim it.



13

00:00:52.461 --> 00:00:54.211

Just go and skim it.



14

00:00:54.211 --> 00:00:55.420

See what's in there.



15

00:00:55.420 --> 00:00:58.960

See what the developers have written.



16

00:00:58.960 --> 00:01:04.570

See how it works, what it is for,
in addition to what I have already stated.



17

00:01:04.570 --> 00:01:09.420

You might get some deeper insights
into how this attack actually works.



18

00:01:09.420 --> 00:01:13.963

One of the bright sides of this
attack is it doesn't actually



19

00:01:13.963 --> 00:01:18.070

require a lot of bandwidth,
not necessarily anyway.



20

00:01:18.070 --> 00:01:19.324

But the more you have, the better.



21

00:01:19.324 --> 00:01:21.950

Okay, so let's scroll down.



22

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:25.212

This is the part that you
really should take a look at.



23

00:01:25.212 --> 00:01:32.295

These are the servers, web servers, that
are affected by this sort of an attack.



24

00:01:32.295 --> 00:01:33.117

And down below,



25

00:01:33.117 --> 00:01:36.837

these are the servers that should not
be vulnerable to this type of attack.



26

00:01:36.837 --> 00:01:38.586

Okay, change here.



27

00:01:38.586 --> 00:01:39.710

I have a slight correction for
myself here.



28

00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:45.920

These are not the servers that are
vulnerable to this type of an attack, but



29

00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:49.063

rather instead,
that are probably vulnerable or



30

00:01:49.063 --> 00:01:52.300

that are likely to be susceptible to this.



31

00:01:52.300 --> 00:01:53.360

Same applies here.



32

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:59.280

On these servers, it's not likely that
this type of an attack will work.



33

00:01:59.280 --> 00:01:59.900

You see, for



34

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:04.650

these two, it's actually verified by
user community that it doesn't work.



35

00:02:04.650 --> 00:02:09.511

You can still go ahead and try it,
if you have the permission,



36

00:02:09.511 --> 00:02:12.420

but it is unlikely that it will work.



37

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:15.961

Anyway, here you have Apache 2,
point something.



38

00:02:15.961 --> 00:02:20.860

That's important because a large amount
of servers out there run on Apache.



39

00:02:21.870 --> 00:02:26.742

And what I am pleased to see here
is that Lighttpd doesn't seem to be



40

00:02:26.742 --> 00:02:31.795

affected by this and Nginx also
doesn't seem to be affected by this.



41

00:02:31.795 --> 00:02:33.003

More importantly, NginX.



42

00:02:33.003 --> 00:02:40.540

If you don't know what NginX is,
it's spelled NginX.



43

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.461

It's an alternative to Apache.



44

00:02:42.461 --> 00:02:47.441

It hasn't been quite around for that long,
like Apache, but definitely long enough,



45

00:02:47.441 --> 00:02:50.860

and people have been using it
as a substitute for Apache.



46

00:02:50.860 --> 00:02:55.546

It's said to be faster, but
I can't really confirm this.



47

00:02:55.546 --> 00:03:00.400

Anyway, that's a bit of extra information
that I just dumped in there somehow.



48

00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.878

Doesn't really matter.



49

00:03:01.878 --> 00:03:05.446

It says here also that
there are requirements for



50

00:03:05.446 --> 00:03:07.628

this script to actually run.



51

00:03:07.628 --> 00:03:11.994

But if you're running it on Kali Linux
in the latest version, as I am,



52

00:03:11.994 --> 00:03:15.220

you shouldn't need to
install anything extra.



53

00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:18.710

If you do, refer to this site and



54

00:03:18.710 --> 00:03:22.800

see what else is missing, but
I don't know, I've tried it.



55

00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.780

I've tried it on the Cullen Linux that
I'm running and you are running the same



56

00:03:25.780 --> 00:03:32.280

system back at your place, you shouldn't
need to install anything of a kind.



57

00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:36.091

Anyway, if you just keep on scrolling.



58

00:03:36.091 --> 00:03:41.066

Just a key note here for anybody out there



59

00:03:41.066 --> 00:03:45.161

that wants to do this on Windows,



60

00:03:45.161 --> 00:03:50.004

you can, but you need to setup Cygwin.



61

00:03:50.004 --> 00:03:56.671

Yeah, this is definitely doable,
but I wouldn't really recommend it.



62

00:03:56.671 --> 00:04:00.242

Anyway, you go down further and
it says download.



63

00:04:00.242 --> 00:04:03.710

It's slowloris.pl.



64

00:04:03.710 --> 00:04:09.800

You will need to download this particular
script or if you want to perform



65

00:04:09.800 --> 00:04:15.250

this DoS attack on an IPv6 protocol,
you can also download this script.



66

00:04:15.250 --> 00:04:21.264

I wouldn't say that that high of
a percentage of the world is using IPv6,



67

00:04:21.264 --> 00:04:22.628

not yet anyway.



68

00:04:22.628 --> 00:04:25.503

But slowly, but surely,
they are switching to IPv6.



69

00:04:25.503 --> 00:04:26.878

Let me tell you why.



70

00:04:26.878 --> 00:04:30.059

You have about four
billion IPv4 addresses and



71

00:04:30.059 --> 00:04:33.251

you have exponentially
more IPv6 addresses.



72

00:04:33.251 --> 00:04:36.310

Because there is a shortage
of IP addresses,



73

00:04:36.310 --> 00:04:39.295

they've switched over to IPv6 protocol.



74

00:04:39.295 --> 00:04:43.128

They made it available, but
I don't know why exactly.



75

00:04:43.128 --> 00:04:49.110

But not that high of a percentage has
switched to IPv6, not yet, anyway.



76

00:04:50.510 --> 00:04:52.750

But in the future, sure, why not?



77

00:04:52.750 --> 00:04:56.010

Anyway, for the time being, you're going
to use this particular script that I said.



78

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:57.600

Just go ahead and click on it.



79

00:04:57.600 --> 00:05:00.560

And, you see that this is not
your average download link.



80

00:05:02.580 --> 00:05:07.187

This is basically a script on the Net
that you are going to CTRL+A to select



81

00:05:07.187 --> 00:05:09.878

everything, and then CTRL+C to copy it.



82

00:05:09.878 --> 00:05:16.638

Normally, I wouldn't advise doing this,
but I trust this site to a good extent and



83

00:05:16.638 --> 00:05:21.003

you're doing this in a virtual machine,
so, yeah.



84

00:05:21.003 --> 00:05:25.562

Though, if you're doing it in a virtual
machine, it's not that dangerous, but



85

00:05:25.562 --> 00:05:29.540

if you're doing it in a physical machine,
it could present problems.



86

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.440

Anyway, let's just go ahead,



87

00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:35.630

I'm gonna I have two of the files
which I've previously created.



88

00:05:35.630 --> 00:05:38.045

So I'm just going to delete both of them.



89

00:05:38.045 --> 00:05:45.045

And I'm going to create a new one,
nano slowloris.



90

00:05:45.045 --> 00:05:47.135

You can name this whatever you want,
by the way.



91

00:05:47.135 --> 00:05:50.110

.pl, but this just makes sense.



92

00:05:50.110 --> 00:05:52.210

And you do need an extension pl, though.



93

00:05:52.210 --> 00:05:55.799

That is an absolute must-have here.



94

00:05:55.799 --> 00:06:00.410

Just open up the file in nano.



95

00:06:00.410 --> 00:06:01.710

Paste the contents.



96

00:06:01.710 --> 00:06:03.730

Don't close it and save it immediately.



97

00:06:03.730 --> 00:06:07.878

It takes a while for everything to load.



98

00:06:07.878 --> 00:06:08.638

You have the code here,



99

00:06:08.638 --> 00:06:10.930

down below as explanations,
the developers have placed there.



100

00:06:10.930 --> 00:06:15.513

So you got some things here,
you can go through the script,



101

00:06:15.513 --> 00:06:19.378

if you wish,
if you know how to read perl scripts.



102

00:06:19.378 --> 00:06:21.003

Ctrl+Alt save.



103

00:06:21.003 --> 00:06:24.046

Press Enter, Ctrl+X to exit.



104

00:06:24.046 --> 00:06:28.130

Do the chmod, make the file executable.



105

00:06:28.130 --> 00:06:31.836

+x slowloris.pl.



106

00:06:31.836 --> 00:06:33.212

Clear the screen.



107

00:06:33.212 --> 00:06:38.170

I'm sure I have the command here somewhere
because I really don't feel like



108

00:06:38.170 --> 00:06:40.220

typing it in now.



109

00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:43.295

I'm bound to make mistakes doing
tutorials when I type them in.



110

00:06:43.295 --> 00:06:47.788

So you have this standard
script execution command ./ to



111

00:06:47.788 --> 00:06:51.921

execute pretty much any
executable script in Linux.



112

00:06:51.921 --> 00:06:57.490

Then you type in the name of the script or
the path to the script.



113

00:06:57.490 --> 00:06:59.880

Then you have this argument dns,
then you have the IP address,



114

00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:00.950

then you have -port 80.



115

00:07:00.950 --> 00:07:04.722

And I do believe this is
the number of threads or



116

00:07:04.722 --> 00:07:08.380

should I say SOCKS that are opened.



117

00:07:08.380 --> 00:07:09.550

Anyway, go ahead.



118

00:07:09.550 --> 00:07:11.580

I have typed in the IP
address of my router,



119

00:07:11.580 --> 00:07:14.070

of course,
on which I'm gonna be performing this.



120

00:07:14.070 --> 00:07:17.580

I have done the Nmap scan for
this particular IP address.



121

00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:22.211

So go ahead and press Enter and
this is going to run.



122

00:07:22.211 --> 00:07:26.590

Let's open up a browser.



123

00:07:26.590 --> 00:07:30.290

It's 192.168.1.1, now it might load,
it might not load.



124

00:07:30.290 --> 00:07:31.545

Okay, it doesn't load.



125

00:07:31.545 --> 00:07:34.671

It says the connection was reset.



126

00:07:34.671 --> 00:07:36.336

I am unable to access it.



127

00:07:36.336 --> 00:07:40.598

So let's go ahead and into Kali,



128

00:07:40.598 --> 00:07:45.629

stop this attack, go back to Firefox.



129

00:07:45.629 --> 00:07:49.004

Let's try reloading the site now.



130

00:07:49.004 --> 00:07:50.420

Try again.



131

00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:55.045

No, I have stopped the script, have I?



132

00:08:00.961 --> 00:08:03.780

Excellent, there we go.



133

00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:08.297

I didn't press try again, I just pressed
Ctrl+R on my keyboard to reload the site.



134

00:08:08.297 --> 00:08:12.585

You can see that now I can type in,
as opposed to before,



135

00:08:12.585 --> 00:08:15.880

you can see that the connection was reset.



136

00:08:15.880 --> 00:08:20.500

So let's just go ahead and cancel this,
and while I'm running the tutorial,



137

00:08:20.500 --> 00:08:24.840

let me just go ahead and do this thing,
Google, so that you know that I have



138

00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:29.461

Internet connectivity, that I am not
disconnected from the Net completely.



139

00:08:29.461 --> 00:08:32.795

Not Q, but Ctrl+C.



140

00:08:32.795 --> 00:08:35.045

So pretty simple to execute.



141

00:08:35.045 --> 00:08:38.200

No, you don't have to invest
that much thought into it,



142

00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:39.860

if you just conduct the scan.



143

00:08:39.860 --> 00:08:42.640

If you see that it's vulnerable,
then you can perform an attack.



144

00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:49.128

If you see that it's not vulnerable, then,
of course, you won't be able to do it.



145

00:08:49.128 --> 00:08:54.407

Now, a key reminder before I finish this,
all of these tests I'm doing on



146

00:08:54.407 --> 00:09:00.115

my router so, on this particular web
service that I'm running on this router,



147

00:09:00.115 --> 00:09:05.336

as you can see, it does have a list of
servers on which it is likely to run.



148

00:09:05.336 --> 00:09:09.283

But, if you do try it on some
other servers that you, of course,



149

00:09:09.283 --> 00:09:12.003

have permission to do so,
it might not run.



150

00:09:12.003 --> 00:09:16.757

Also, it might actually slow the sites
down, increase the loading time or



151

00:09:16.757 --> 00:09:22.128

increase the loading time to a couple of
minutes as, I do believe, I stated before.



152

00:09:22.128 --> 00:09:25.587

So, it can be a full DoS attack or
a partial DoS attack.



153

00:09:25.587 --> 00:09:27.920

If it's a partial one,
don't be discouraged.



154

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:32.307

It's pretty much just as effective as
the real one, primarily because nobody is



155

00:09:32.307 --> 00:09:36.836

going to wait around for five minutes for
their sites to load or rarely anyone will.



156

00:09:36.836 --> 00:09:42.320

Just try putting yourself
in such a position.



157

00:09:42.320 --> 00:09:45.350

Anyway, I bid you farewell here and
I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
