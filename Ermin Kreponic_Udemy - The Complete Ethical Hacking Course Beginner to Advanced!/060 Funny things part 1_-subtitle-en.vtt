00:00:00.600 --> 00:00:03.040

Hello everybody, and
welcome to the tutorial.



2

00:00:03.040 --> 00:00:09.650

Today I've decided to do something a bit
more fun to ease the path, so to say.



3

00:00:10.820 --> 00:00:14.360

And we're gonna be doing some sort of
thing that people generally do for



4

00:00:14.360 --> 00:00:17.320

April Fool, or something of a kind.



5

00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.910

Basically you've got to modify
the browsing information of



6

00:00:22.910 --> 00:00:28.390

anybody that you can spoof,
who's art you can spoof.



7

00:00:28.390 --> 00:00:33.820

What this means is that you can
actually affect how they view websites.



8

00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:40.340

For example you can flip all images on
a website upside down or you can insert



9

00:00:41.660 --> 00:00:47.490

text, or perhaps you can add extra words
to Google search, or I don't know.



10

00:00:47.490 --> 00:00:53.650

You can do some crazy things like change
language settings to something ridiculous,



11

00:00:53.650 --> 00:00:57.960

like there are these fictional languages,
something from Star Trek,



12

00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:00.840

I do believe that I found it on the net,
a small script, that actually



13

00:01:00.840 --> 00:01:05.165

changes your language settings to
Klingon while browsing the internet.



14

00:01:05.165 --> 00:01:09.230

[LAUGH] Can you just
imagine reading anything,



15

00:01:09.230 --> 00:01:14.120

trying to read something, or trying to
translate it back, or something of a kind.



16

00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.260

That wouldn't really be fun.



17

00:01:16.260 --> 00:01:21.110

Anyway, even though this is primarily for
fun, this part anyway,



18

00:01:21.110 --> 00:01:22.805

you still, of course,



19

00:01:22.805 --> 00:01:28.140

would need a permission, unless you are on
your own wireless or something of a kind.



20

00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:32.470

Anyway, I have a small instruction
script for myself here, just so



21

00:01:32.470 --> 00:01:37.100

that I don't mess anything
up during this procedure.



22

00:01:37.100 --> 00:01:40.520

I have already done it, and
it seems to work to a good extent.



23

00:01:40.520 --> 00:01:45.400

Some of the scripts, they won't always
work, but a good amount of the time,



24

00:01:45.400 --> 00:01:49.850

you will be able to achieve what you want.



25

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:53.180

Anyway, first of all,
we need something called Squid.



26

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:56.240

And Squid is a proxy.



27

00:01:56.240 --> 00:02:02.230

So let me just show you, apt-cache search



28

00:02:02.230 --> 00:02:07.400

squid, and I'm gonna say 3.



29

00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.540

Also you might have noticed
that I am back in Kali Linux.



30

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:16.350

And Kali Linux comes with a lot
of these tools pre-installed so



31

00:02:16.350 --> 00:02:19.620

I don't need to go through a lot
of hassle or something like that.



32

00:02:20.630 --> 00:02:26.870

And the configuration is a bit simpler
as you have a set of predefined here.



33

00:02:28.150 --> 00:02:35.510

Also, I don't need direct access to
wireless for this sort of an attack.



34

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:37.400

Anyway, we're gonna need to install Squid.



35

00:02:37.400 --> 00:02:44.970

You can see here squid3,
full featured web proxy cache, HTTP proxy.



36

00:02:44.970 --> 00:02:50.282

In order to install it, opps, not yum,



37

00:02:50.282 --> 00:02:56.861

type in app-get install,
and then Squid3 -y.



38

00:02:56.861 --> 00:02:58.743

Press Enter and this will install it.



39

00:02:58.743 --> 00:03:02.940

I'm not going to press Enter now
because I already have it installed.



40

00:03:02.940 --> 00:03:07.150

That is one of the tools which we
are going to need but there is more.



41

00:03:07.150 --> 00:03:09.510

You will need Apache Web Server for this.



42

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:16.925

So, again with the yum, apt-get search and



43

00:03:16.925 --> 00:03:21.430

we're gonna need apache.



44

00:03:21.430 --> 00:03:26.111

Apache is a well known,
oops, it's not get it's.



45

00:03:29.371 --> 00:03:32.740

Apache, sorry.



46

00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:39.100

Apache is a well known web server used
by the majority of the world today.



47

00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:43.140

I don't know what percentage
of user actually uses Apache,



48

00:03:43.140 --> 00:03:47.690

but lately there was some other web
servers which became really popular.



49

00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:52.737

For example, Nginx,
that's gained in popularity really fast.



50

00:03:52.737 --> 00:03:58.760

Apparently it's a lot faster.



51

00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.205

I can't find the exact name of the package
here but it doesn't really matter.



52

00:04:03.205 --> 00:04:08.870

Look, just type in yum, oops again.



53

00:04:08.870 --> 00:04:12.300

Just type in apt-get install apache2.



54

00:04:12.300 --> 00:04:14.280

Press Enter and then there you go.



55

00:04:16.460 --> 00:04:21.110

It says that Apache2 is already
the newest version, and



56

00:04:21.110 --> 00:04:25.260

that doesn't really, oh,
wait, I need 62 upgrades.



57

00:04:25.260 --> 00:04:28.150

It doesn't matter, I'm not going
to do any of the upgrades now.



58

00:04:28.150 --> 00:04:29.915

But anyway,
this is the command to install it.



59

00:04:29.915 --> 00:04:32.280

Apache2 is the name of the package.



60

00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:35.080

I could have found it
in the list up there,



61

00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:38.850

but figured I would just save some time
and give you the direct command for



62

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:43.050

you to install it so that we don't
have too much of a time loss there.



63

00:04:43.050 --> 00:04:45.970

Anyway, go ahead and clear the screen.



64

00:04:45.970 --> 00:04:50.860

The next thing that you're going
to need is a bunch of scripts



65

00:04:52.580 --> 00:04:55.270

and I do believe I have them here.



66

00:04:55.270 --> 00:04:57.488

No, not these scripts.



67

00:04:57.488 --> 00:05:01.068

Hm, where do you suppose they are?



68

00:05:01.068 --> 00:05:05.748

Well, okay I do have them but
they're on my clipboard.



69

00:05:05.748 --> 00:05:13.068

Okay, so it's apt-get -y Install,
and you need these three programs.



70

00:05:13.068 --> 00:05:16.190

So imagemagick, ghostscript, and jp2a.



71

00:05:16.190 --> 00:05:21.090

I've written for myself here,
ghostscript optional.



72

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.500

You will only need ghostscripts for



73

00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:28.220

certain scripts that we're
gonna download from the net.



74

00:05:28.220 --> 00:05:30.793

Not sure exactly which ones but
you can just install it,



75

00:05:30.793 --> 00:05:33.770

it doesn't take a lot of space and
it doesn't take a lot of time.



76

00:05:33.770 --> 00:05:39.670

Let me just see if I have all of them
installed and yes I do have all three



77

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:43.700

of them installed here so no problems
there but if you don't just go ahead and



78

00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:48.660

run the same command, of course, and
you will have it installed no problems.



79

00:05:49.870 --> 00:05:52.190

Just go ahead and clear the screen.



80

00:05:53.610 --> 00:05:56.960

Anyway, those three tools,



81

00:05:56.960 --> 00:06:01.590

we are going to need in order
to actually perform this attack.



82

00:06:01.590 --> 00:06:03.108

So let's go over them one more time.



83

00:06:03.108 --> 00:06:09.146

It's Squid, Apache, and these last
three scripts that I have shown you.



84

00:06:09.146 --> 00:06:11.546

Not three scripts, sorry,
I keep on calling them scripts.



85

00:06:11.546 --> 00:06:14.466

They're script,
well this one is a script interpreter.



86

00:06:14.466 --> 00:06:20.944

And this is actually, I don't know,
this is just a program for



87

00:06:20.944 --> 00:06:26.590

manipulating images on the Web or
something of a kind.



88

00:06:26.590 --> 00:06:31.810

Anyway, so these three as well, and then
we will be able to perform this attack.



89

00:06:31.810 --> 00:06:34.000

Make sure that you have
them all installed.



90

00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.060

We don't need to configure anything,
we will do the configuration in the next



91

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:41.290

tutorial, but make sure that you
have all three of them installed.



92

00:06:41.290 --> 00:06:45.960

Before you start watching the next
tutorial because there I will actually go



93

00:06:45.960 --> 00:06:50.010

into the configuration and we will see
what we need to do in order to prepare.



94

00:06:50.010 --> 00:06:51.550

Some of the things we've already done,



95

00:06:51.550 --> 00:06:54.750

if you've kept the configuration
from the previous tutorials.



96

00:06:54.750 --> 00:06:59.340

But if not,
you're gonna need to do a few things here.



97

00:06:59.340 --> 00:07:03.489

Anyway, I bid you all farewell, and
I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
