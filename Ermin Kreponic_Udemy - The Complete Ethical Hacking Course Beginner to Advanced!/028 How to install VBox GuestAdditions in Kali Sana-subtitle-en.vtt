00:00:00.350 --> 00:00:07.620

Hi everybody. Today, I am going to go ahead

and show you how to install VirtualBox guest



2

00:00:07.620 --> 00:00:15.940

additions on your newly installed Kali machine.

So let's get to it. You can start up from



3

00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:21.340

here. There we go. No need to use the terminal

start it. We already have it installed. So



4

00:00:21.340 --> 00:00:27.190

let's boot it up. I already have my VirtualBox

guest additions installed. The reason why



5

00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:33.809

I installed it before I gave the instructions,

and record it as I actually did the first



6

00:00:33.809 --> 00:00:42.429

time around. Well, I the screen is really

small. It's kinda hard to of squeezed things



7

00:00:42.429 --> 00:00:49.760

in there. I figured I would install it and

expand the screen and then show you in a full-size



8

00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:55.479

screen all the things that you need to do.

I just think that that's a little bit more



9

00:00:55.479 --> 00:01:01.789

efficient for you to be able to see everything,

as opposed to just looking at things on a



10

00:01:01.789 --> 00:01:09.960

really small screen. So let's go ahead and

login. Hopefully you agree with me. There



11

00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:16.619

is nothing different that you need to do.

It's like absolutely the same things. So let's



12

00:01:16.619 --> 00:01:23.250

go ahead and fire up a terminal. Expand it.

I'm going to zoom in so you all can see like



13

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:38.820

these big, chunky letters. Let's go ahead

and type in "app- get upgrade && app-get upgrade."



14

00:01:38.820 --> 00:01:44.189

I've already done it so it shouldn't be long

for me. It's just going to check. This is



15

00:01:44.189 --> 00:01:48.869

the first thing that you should do, aside

from checking your Internet connection, of



16

00:01:48.869 --> 00:01:56.899

course, with a ping. If the ping is functional,

it's all fine and dandy. Now, the next thing



17

00:01:56.899 --> 00:02:03.859

that you need to do is basically just type

in app – well, let's go ahead and clear



18

00:02:03.859 --> 00:02:20.350

the screen first – "app- cache search header

| grep -i linux." Then type in "uname -r."



19

00:02:20.350 --> 00:02:27.540

Let's match the output of uname -r to these

linuxs headers. We have: 400 Kali1 AMD64,



20

00:02:27.540 --> 00:02:41.590

400 Kali1 all, 400 Kali1 all AMD 64 meta package.

So, we can go with the meta package, or we



21

00:02:41.590 --> 00:02:48.500

can go with the specific one. Let's go with

the meta package. I'm pretty sure that you



22

00:02:48.500 --> 00:03:04.620

will be able to go with both of them.There

we go, press enter. Working, working, working.



23

00:03:04.620 --> 00:03:14.660

Any time now, my good man, any time. I know

it can be a little bit tedious. No big deal.



24

00:03:14.660 --> 00:03:24.110

After you have done all of this, just in case,

repeat this again. app – get update and



25

00:03:24.110 --> 00:03:32.360

app – get upgrade, just in case. You wouldn't

believe how the problems arise from just not



26

00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:41.680

staying up-to-date with packages. Now, reboot

the machine. Just go ahead and reboot it.



27

00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:46.310

No big deal, should be fast and not waste

too much time. Afterwards, we can install



28

00:03:46.310 --> 00:03:52.040

the guest additions, reboot the machine one

more time, and that will be the end of it.



29

00:03:52.040 --> 00:03:56.870

That is literally all that we will need to

do, nothing else. Nothing super important



30

00:03:56.870 --> 00:04:08.820

there. Okay, so go, go, go. These messages

can be a little bit annoying. I think you



31

00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:26.560

can make them go away if you click the other

thing, aside from the X. 

So let's go. I hate waiting for these things.



32

00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:34.330

So, next thing you need to go is to click

on devices and say, insert it. So mine is



33

00:04:34.330 --> 00:04:42.260

already inserted. No big deal, but for you

it will insert it. And there's there's no



34

00:04:42.260 --> 00:04:47.780

point to insert twice. I mean, I could technically

remove it and then insert it again. There's



35

00:04:47.780 --> 00:05:00.760

much point in doing that. So just go ahead

and do this: see the media CD-ROM0, then LS



36

00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:17.370

and there you go. Then, cp VboxLinuxadditions.run

/root/desktop. I already have them there,



37

00:05:17.370 --> 00:05:20.930

but you will be able to copy them. I'm not

going to copy them twice. That was the command



38

00:05:20.930 --> 00:05:30.570

that you needed to run. Then go over to here,

cd root/desktop. Then type, ls. You will see



39

00:05:30.570 --> 00:05:38.920

VirtualBox guest additions. Here, I can run

them one more time. No big deal. It's going.



40

00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:43.889

The installation is going go forward. It shouldn't

take too long. Again, I know, I know it's



41

00:05:43.889 --> 00:05:53.700

a little bit tedious to just wait through

these things, but hey. Okay, building. The



42

00:05:53.700 --> 00:06:00.810

headers for the current kernel were not found.

Okay, so yeah, these things can happen. But



43

00:06:00.810 --> 00:06:08.270

no big deal. It should still run the whole

process. You will have like 99% of all the



44

00:06:08.270 --> 00:06:15.240

functionalities here that you will be able

to utilize any way you choose. Please, as



45

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:20.139

long as full-screen works, the connection

works, and copy-paste works, you are good



46

00:06:20.139 --> 00:06:26.919

to go. Okay, so there you go. That is all

you needed to do. Now all you need to type



47

00:06:26.919 --> 00:06:32.560

in is reboot. Upon reboot, you will be able

to use your VirtualBox with full screen and



48

00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:37.930

pretty much all the functionalities that it

has to offer. By the way, at the end of this,



49

00:06:37.930 --> 00:06:47.110

I really did not expect things to work out

with Fedora 22, Kali 20 or with the new VirtualBox.



50

00:06:47.110 --> 00:06:55.490

This is because all three of those systems

are practically brand new. Things with systems



51

00:06:55.490 --> 00:07:01.210

that are brand-new tend to be buggy, problematic

and so on and so forth. So, I really didn't



52

00:07:01.210 --> 00:07:08.120

expect things to work out, but for the most

part they did. Anyway, I hope this was first



53

00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.230

useful tool if you were struggling with the

setup. I bid you all farewell.
