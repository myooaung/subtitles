00:00:00,090 --> 00:00:02,510
Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,510 --> 00:00:07,140
Today, I am going to just
continue up on evil twin.

3
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:09,790
We have managed to get
the client to associate with us.

4
00:00:10,820 --> 00:00:12,650
But what good is it?

5
00:00:12,650 --> 00:00:18,970
Primarily because that client will not
have infinite access until we configure

6
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:24,770
our network settings so that there is
a bridge between our fake wireless

7
00:00:24,770 --> 00:00:29,770
access point and our network interface,
which actually has internet connection.

8
00:00:31,200 --> 00:00:36,080
Only then will the client on the other
side actually be able to access Internet

9
00:00:36,080 --> 00:00:40,584
and only then will we actually be able
to harvest any sort of information

10
00:00:40,584 --> 00:00:41,504
whatsoever.

11
00:00:41,504 --> 00:00:46,212
So on the right side for this purpose
I have made a series of commands

12
00:00:46,212 --> 00:00:50,770
which you will need to run and
they're not really complicated.

13
00:00:50,770 --> 00:00:53,267
It's more or
less the same command running over and

14
00:00:53,267 --> 00:00:55,254
over again with different interfaces.

15
00:00:55,254 --> 00:01:00,400
What you will need first is bridge-utils,

16
00:01:00,400 --> 00:01:04,851
so go ahead and type yum_search, and

17
00:01:04,851 --> 00:01:09,733
I'm just going to copy/paste the name.

18
00:01:09,733 --> 00:01:10,434
Excellent, there we go.

19
00:01:10,434 --> 00:01:13,890
So it says bridge-utils.x86_64.

20
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,375
You need to install this,

21
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:19,560
hopefully by now you have learned how
to install these things, but just in

22
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,901
case you didn't, all you need to do is
type in yum install and then paste it.

23
00:01:23,901 --> 00:01:29,729
By default it will pick up that it's this
package x86_64, just type in yum install

24
00:01:29,729 --> 00:01:35,500
bridge-utils -y, and that's gonna install
without asking you any questions.

25
00:01:35,500 --> 00:01:40,754
Now, I have it already installed here so
there's no need to go through the process.

26
00:01:40,754 --> 00:01:46,606
Next up,
what we need to do is have this one,

27
00:01:46,606 --> 00:01:50,260
it says brctl addbr evil.

28
00:01:50,260 --> 00:01:53,180
You can name it any way you
like I have named it evil,

29
00:01:53,180 --> 00:01:54,820
but it doesn't really matter.

30
00:01:55,830 --> 00:01:57,100
Whatever the name will go.

31
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:00,150
This name is completely irrelevant,
as far as I know.

32
00:02:00,150 --> 00:02:02,620
So just go ahead and type in.

33
00:02:02,620 --> 00:02:05,860
It says, device evil already exists;
can't create bridge with the same name.

34
00:02:05,860 --> 00:02:10,130
It doesn't matter for me it already
exists because I have previously created.

35
00:02:10,130 --> 00:02:14,900
For you, this command will just fly
without any sort of problems whatsoever.

36
00:02:14,900 --> 00:02:17,160
Now the next thing that you need to do.

37
00:02:17,160 --> 00:02:23,150
Well this is where it says p8p1, that
is the interface, let me just show you.

38
00:02:23,150 --> 00:02:27,400
IF config.
There is a whole lot of interfaces and

39
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:28,820
information out here.

40
00:02:28,820 --> 00:02:30,662
I'm gonna need to change the zoom here.

41
00:02:33,263 --> 00:02:33,922
Excellent.

42
00:02:33,922 --> 00:02:35,220
This is much better.

43
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:39,860
So look, the interface p8p1 is
the interface that I'm currently using.

44
00:02:39,860 --> 00:02:43,280
That is my wired interface and
that interface has Internet access.

45
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,410
What I need to do is bridge evil and

46
00:02:48,410 --> 00:02:52,320
p8p1 and that is exactly what
this command will do for us.

47
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,020
So, just go ahead and copy.

48
00:02:57,365 --> 00:02:57,931
There we go.
Okay,

49
00:02:57,931 --> 00:03:03,520
p8p1 is already a member of bridge;
can't enslave it to the bridge evil.

50
00:03:03,520 --> 00:03:08,258
So I've already added it, so it can't
repeat the process twice for you again or

51
00:03:08,258 --> 00:03:09,613
the command will fly.

52
00:03:09,613 --> 00:03:14,982
Now we have linked this intermediary
interface named evil to

53
00:03:14,982 --> 00:03:21,740
the interface p8p1,
which actually has internet connectivity.

54
00:03:21,740 --> 00:03:26,440
However, we also need to
add to this the interface

55
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:31,730
which is created by airbase and
that is at0.

56
00:03:34,250 --> 00:03:36,880
Basically what we are doing is
repeating the process twice.

57
00:03:36,880 --> 00:03:39,420
Let's just go ahead and clear the screen.

58
00:03:40,880 --> 00:03:44,800
Paste.
So you see, previously, I have added p8p1,

59
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:47,650
which has Internet connectivity to evil.

60
00:03:47,650 --> 00:03:48,423
I have bridged them.

61
00:03:48,423 --> 00:03:53,330
And now, I am going to bridge at0 to evil.

62
00:03:53,330 --> 00:03:57,240
Don't worry, at0 should be the same on
your system because airbase will create

63
00:03:57,240 --> 00:03:58,570
this interface for you.

64
00:03:59,800 --> 00:04:03,810
No problems there, all you need to do
is bridge it to this intermediary, and

65
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:06,580
you should eventually have
Internet connectivity.

66
00:04:06,580 --> 00:04:07,660
Press Enter.

67
00:04:07,660 --> 00:04:10,670
Again I get an error message
because it says that the process

68
00:04:10,670 --> 00:04:13,740
has already taken place,
and it cannot duplicate it.

69
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:15,280
For you, it's gonna fly.

70
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,367
Next up,
basically what we need to do is add IP

71
00:04:19,367 --> 00:04:23,542
addresses to the exempted interfaces and

72
00:04:23,542 --> 00:04:28,670
furthermore, we need to change their
state to up, primarily because

73
00:04:28,670 --> 00:04:33,380
the states of these interfaces are not
up by default and that can be a problem.

74
00:04:33,380 --> 00:04:36,200
So you just need to bring it up manually.

75
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:37,040
No big deal.

76
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:41,010
These commands are pretty simple and
straightforward.

77
00:04:41,010 --> 00:04:45,460
So ifconfig, which you've used before,
name of the interface this is,

78
00:04:45,460 --> 00:04:49,100
strange as it might look,
this actually is the IP address.

79
00:04:49,100 --> 00:04:50,020
And just say up.

80
00:04:51,290 --> 00:04:52,700
Excellent, there we go.

81
00:04:52,700 --> 00:04:53,560
Confirmation.

82
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:54,610
No confirmation message.

83
00:04:54,610 --> 00:04:57,792
Nothing.
The command has passed through.

84
00:04:57,792 --> 00:05:01,576
Excellent.
Now we need to bring evil up as well,

85
00:05:01,576 --> 00:05:06,220
also our bridging interface,
ifconfig evil up.

86
00:05:06,220 --> 00:05:08,260
No need to assign an IP address there.

87
00:05:08,260 --> 00:05:13,722
And we don't need to bring p8p1 of course
up, primarily because it's already up.

88
00:05:13,722 --> 00:05:15,663
It has Internet connectivity.

89
00:05:15,663 --> 00:05:18,462
Just copy this as well.

90
00:05:18,462 --> 00:05:24,095
Paste.
So dhclient3 evil &,

91
00:05:24,095 --> 00:05:27,200
press Enter.

92
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:27,900
Press Enter.

93
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:28,860
Yep.
There we go.

94
00:05:28,860 --> 00:05:29,420
Hold on.

95
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:30,600
Wait, wait, wait.

96
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:32,662
Why are you giving me this?

97
00:05:37,142 --> 00:05:38,502
Let's remove the redirection.

98
00:05:42,082 --> 00:05:43,210
Excellent, there we go.

99
00:05:43,210 --> 00:05:47,080
You you can just type in dhclient evil and
that should work as well.

100
00:05:47,080 --> 00:05:51,080
I'm fairly certain that this
command worked a moment ago,

101
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:51,950
but it doesn't really matter.

102
00:05:51,950 --> 00:05:56,133
It says dhclient is
already running- exiting,

103
00:05:56,133 --> 00:06:00,120
so no need to actually
do anything here for me.

104
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:02,166
But for you, you will just need to go and

105
00:06:02,166 --> 00:06:04,974
follow through pretty much
exactly what I've said.

106
00:06:04,974 --> 00:06:09,556
Now once this is configured you see that
my airbase on this side is still running.

107
00:06:09,556 --> 00:06:15,640
So I have not shut down from
it since last time I did this.

108
00:06:15,640 --> 00:06:20,806
Now the client on the other side, either
the phone or a tablet or a computer or

109
00:06:20,806 --> 00:06:25,165
something of a kind that is
connecting to our fake access point,

110
00:06:25,165 --> 00:06:28,799
to our evil twin,
will have Internet connectivity,

111
00:06:28,799 --> 00:06:33,354
will be able to browse the net and
will literally suspect nothing.

112
00:06:33,354 --> 00:06:37,140
Cuz you get disconnected from wireless.

113
00:06:37,140 --> 00:06:38,220
It's not uncommon.

114
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:40,770
I mean be honest with yourselves,

115
00:06:40,770 --> 00:06:44,900
ask yourselves if I get this disconnected
from a wireless for a couple of seconds,

116
00:06:44,900 --> 00:06:50,050
will I suspect that there's some foul play
here that somebody's doing something,

117
00:06:50,050 --> 00:06:52,190
or that somebody's hacking,
or something of a kind?

118
00:06:52,190 --> 00:06:53,195
No, of course not.

119
00:06:53,195 --> 00:06:54,780
[LAUGH].
If you get the authenticator

120
00:06:54,780 --> 00:06:57,250
you will simply press reconnect.

121
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,510
Or the device will reconnect automatically
for you, and, while you're waiting for

122
00:07:00,510 --> 00:07:03,310
that reconnect,
you'll probably be staring at the device,

123
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,550
literally looking at it and
not suspecting a thing.

124
00:07:07,550 --> 00:07:11,680
Anyway, in the follow-up tutorial,
I am going to show you

125
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,360
how you can actually monitor the traffic
of somebody that is connected to your

126
00:07:16,360 --> 00:07:21,160
fake wireless access point and
how you can extract that information.

127
00:07:22,830 --> 00:07:26,460
Until then, I bid you farewell and
hope to see you in the next tutorial.
