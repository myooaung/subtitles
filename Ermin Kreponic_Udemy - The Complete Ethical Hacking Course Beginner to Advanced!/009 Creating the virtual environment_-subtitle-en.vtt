00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.500

Hello everybody and welcome to this

tutorial today.



2

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.359

Today I will go ahead download Kali Linux



3

00:00:07.359 --> 00:00:10.719

and demonstrate the installation procedure as well



4

00:00:10.719 --> 00:00:13.500

within a virtual environment.



5

00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.400

So first off, go ahead open up your browser.



6

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:22.500

Type in Kali Linux.



7

00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:23.279

Press "Enter"



8

00:00:23.279 --> 00:00:27.300

Navigate over to their website.



9

00:00:27.300 --> 00:00:31.000

So its www.kali.org



10

00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:32.400

It's HTTPS



11

00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:34.400

Don't forget to check that.



12

00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:39.200

Go ahead and navigate over to downloads.



13

00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:41.600

Let me just go ahead and zoom in here.



14

00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:42.100

Excellent



15

00:00:42.100 --> 00:00:46.500

So here you have images -- It says "Kali Linux 64 bit"



16

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:50.200

You can have a direct ISO download.



17

00:00:50.200 --> 00:00:54.500

Download of an ISO file, or you can go over to the torrents



18

00:00:54.500 --> 00:00:55.640

and download it from there.



19

00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:00.180

Now Kali Linux, the among tools that it has



20

00:01:00.180 --> 00:01:03.789

and that come pre-installed



21

00:01:03.789 --> 00:01:07.800

is fairly massive for a Linux distro



22

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.840

I mean, its 3 gigabytes, which is huge.



23

00:01:11.840 --> 00:01:15.900

Yeah, the download of 3 gigabytes



24

00:01:15.900 --> 00:01:17.800

it's not just gonna fly like that.



25

00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:18.930

Well, it maybe it will



26

00:01:18.930 --> 00:01:21.800

I don't know what sort of a connection to you have



27

00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.340

but for the sake of this tutorial



28

00:01:23.340 --> 00:01:25.300

I have downloaded it, prior to this



29

00:01:25.300 --> 00:01:29.759

so we don't have to go over that through procedure here.



30

00:01:29.759 --> 00:01:32.900

Basically waiting for the download itself to happen.



31

00:01:32.900 --> 00:01:35.300

What you want case you didn't do it



32

00:01:35.300 --> 00:01:37.500

you can just go ahead and click on "ISO"



33

00:01:37.500 --> 00:01:39.500

Click here "Save"



34

00:01:39.500 --> 00:01:40.600

Click "Okay"



35

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:43.700

and download procedure will begin.



36

00:01:43.700 --> 00:01:46.500

It will be displayed here in the upper right corner.



37

00:01:46.500 --> 00:01:50.000

So you see it reports an hour and 20 minutes.



38

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.300

Just gonna go ahead and stop that because I don't want that happening



39

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:55.400

and then you have the torrent version

as well.



40

00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:58.000

So you can just click on "torrents"



41

00:01:58.000 --> 00:01:59.170

Save  file



42

00:01:59.170 --> 00:02:03.130

Open up what is displayed here



43

00:02:03.130 --> 00:02:07.530

and it should open up transmission at some point of time



44

00:02:07.530 --> 00:02:11.600

Just go ahead and try that again



45

00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:14.920

Yep, there we go.



46

00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.400

So it has a few files here



47

00:02:16.400 --> 00:02:18.800

and just go ahead and click "open"



48

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:22.100

and it's gonna start the download process.



49

00:02:22.100 --> 00:02:26.600

This might be a bit of a faster option, depending on the status of seeders



50

00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:29.500

but it's really up to you.



51

00:02:29.500 --> 00:02:30.410

You can't really go wrong



52

00:02:30.410 --> 00:02:33.520

especially if you have a faster internet

connection.



53

00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:37.170

It will not matter that much to you.



54

00:02:37.170 --> 00:02:40.250

Let me just go ahead and close the browser.



55

00:02:40.250 --> 00:02:44.540

Now I need to go ahead navigate over to my start menu



56

00:02:44.540 --> 00:02:48.190

and type in VirtualBox



57

00:02:48.190 --> 00:02:53.800

and as soon as you type start typing, it gives you the list of options.



58

00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.500

So just go ahead and take this one.



59

00:02:56.500 --> 00:02:59.500

You might wanna pin it to a taskbar or something like that



60

00:02:59.500 --> 00:03:04.200

like I have pinned it to my left panel.



61

00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.700

Open up VirtualBox.



62

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:06.300

Excellent



63

00:03:06.300 --> 00:03:09.100

So I have few machines set up here.



64

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:12.800

Here, you can see I have like 1-2-3-4-5



65

00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:14.800

I have five virtual machines set up.



66

00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:17.500

I can't them all at the same time because...



67

00:03:17.500 --> 00:03:20.100

well, maybe I could if I reduce the amount of resources



68

00:03:20.100 --> 00:03:23.400

that I allot to each one of them



69

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.100

but I will not do that now.



70

00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.000

For the time being, I want to install a brand new Kali Linux



71

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.300

Before I can do that, I need to do a bit of a configuration.



72

00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:36.200

So first off, before the installation procedure starts



73

00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.250

or anything of a kind



74

00:03:37.250 --> 00:03:43.000

I need to create a new environment in which this machine will be installed.



75

00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000

So go ahead and click on "new"



76

00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.500

Type in whatever name you wish.



77

00:03:49.500 --> 00:03:51.870

I'm just going type in "Kali"



78

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:56.000

So I know that it's a Kali Linux



79

00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.090

because I have a lot of other virtual machines here



80

00:03:58.090 --> 00:04:00.500

but you can name it whatever you want.



81

00:04:00.500 --> 00:04:04.100

The choice is entirely up to you.



82

00:04:04.100 --> 00:04:06.600

Type -- It's obviously not Microsoft Windows.



83

00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:11.330

It's Linux and it's not Ubuntu 64



84

00:04:11.330 --> 00:04:14.460

but since it's based on Debian



85

00:04:14.460 --> 00:04:18.190

I suppose I could type in Debian 64.



86

00:04:18.190 --> 00:04:21.000

Debian 64 bit here.



87

00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:23.100

Not sure if they have Kali.



88

00:04:23.100 --> 00:04:24.880

Probably not.



89

00:04:24.880 --> 00:04:26.500

There we go -- They do not have it.



90

00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:27.100

It doesn't matter.



91

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:31.000

If you type in version Debian 64 bit, this is going to work.



92

00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.200

No problems.



93

00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.000

Just click "next" -- that's it.



94

00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:39.240

Here you will allot the amount of RAM that you wanted to have



95

00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:42.370

Now, its not RAM intensive.



96

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.400

It should work fine, as it is by default



97

00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:50.200

but I just have a habit of allotting it above one gigabyte.



98

00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:55.300

For the sake of this tutorial, I will allot it to two gigabytes of RAM



99

00:04:55.300 --> 00:05:00.200

primarily because we will be working with some of the programs



100

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:01.400

that can be demanding



101

00:05:01.400 --> 00:05:03.490

and it can be resource intensive.



102

00:05:03.490 --> 00:05:06.400

So I want to do this.



103

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:12.000

Don't worry about it if you given it too much RAM or too little RAM



104

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.400

You can always change this later on.



105

00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:15.960

This is very flexible



106

00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:17.900

That's the beauty of VirtualBox.



107

00:05:17.900 --> 00:05:19.000

That's why I like it so much.



108

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.400

You can change these at any point of time



109

00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:26.800

if you deemed that you need the resources elsewhere



110

00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:29.430

or you have more resources that you can allot here.



111

00:05:29.430 --> 00:05:32.600

So just click "next"



112

00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.000

Just go ahead click "create"



113

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.800

Create a virtual hard drive.



114

00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.230

Now that is the drive this machine will be using



115

00:05:40.230 --> 00:05:43.520

and just use this one -- VDI VirtualBox.



116

00:05:43.520 --> 00:05:46.500

Disk image -- that's the hard drive file type.



117

00:05:46.500 --> 00:05:47.510

Click "next"



118

00:05:47.510 --> 00:05:52.500

Dynamically allocated -- that's very

important



119

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:53.630

and you can see



120

00:05:53.630 --> 00:05:56.600

you can read here you what "Dynamically allocated" means.



121

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.000

Basically, it is hard drive file will use space in your physical hard drive



122

00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.700

as it fields up.



123

00:06:03.700 --> 00:06:08.400

Up to the maximum fixed size and



124

00:06:08.400 --> 00:06:10.000

and click "next"



125

00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:12.800

Here you will allot dry space.



126

00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:16.300

Now, I have a lot of dry space, so I'm just going to go ahead



127

00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.410

and allot, like maybe, 120 gigs.



128

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:26.000

That's gonna be more than enough for this undertaking



129

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.400

since I do have a lot of dry space in my laptop



130

00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:29.400

I don't really care



131

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:32.700

but if you don't have enough dry space or something like that



132

00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:36.300

you can go ahead and allot 50 gigabytes or something like that



133

00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:38.000

It should work fine, no problems.



134

00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:43.000

720 is more than I need. Way more.



135

00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.600

Just go ahead and click "create"



136

00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:47.600

That's it.



137

00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.000

Now we have our Kali



138

00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.800

and now we have our environment, under the name "Kali" set up.



139

00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:56.170

There is just one more thing that we need to do.



140

00:06:56.170 --> 00:06:59.480

We need to configure the boot order for this machine



141

00:06:59.480 --> 00:07:01.400

and maybe not the boot order



142

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:06.000

but rather instead, the location of the ISO file



143

00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.230

which it will pull.



144

00:07:07.230 --> 00:07:10.000

So go ahead and right click on it.



145

00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:10.840

"Settings"



146

00:07:10.840 --> 00:07:13.000

"Display"



147

00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:13.500

"Storage"



148

00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:16.600

Click on "Storage"



149

00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.920

Click on "Empty"



150

00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:20.700

There's this disc icon here.



151

00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:25.800

When you click on it, it says "choose a virtual CD disk file"



152

00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:27.810

So I have a few here



153

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:31.300

but none of these are what I actually need.



154

00:07:31.300 --> 00:07:33.200

If you have something in your cd-rom drive



155

00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:36.000

you can just go ahead and click here



156

00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:38.070

and it's gonna pull an image from a CD



157

00:07:38.070 --> 00:07:40.500

but that's not really the case here.



158

00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.600

We have an ISO file that we want to use.



159

00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:44.500

So just go ahead and open it up.



160

00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:47.500

Click on "Home"



161

00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:51.400

and I have it in my downloads folder.



162

00:07:51.400 --> 00:07:52.680

It should be around here somewhere.



163

00:07:52.680 --> 00:07:53.500

Yup, there we go!



164

00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:58.200

Kali Linux 1.0.9a-amd64



165

00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:01.140

I do believe that I'm slightly behind the latest version



166

00:08:01.140 --> 00:08:04.200

but we're gonna fix that with updates, no problems.



167

00:08:04.200 --> 00:08:05.200

Open it up it



168

00:08:05.200 --> 00:08:09.200

It says "Kali Linux 1.0.9a-amd64.iso"



169

00:08:09.200 --> 00:08:12.900

and that is the type of file that we're looking for - ".iso"



170

00:08:12.900 --> 00:08:15.900

Open it up. There you go.



171

00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.200

It's now inserted.



172

00:08:17.200 --> 00:08:20.700

You can see it here -- The blue marcation in the center.



173

00:08:20.700 --> 00:08:24.100

It's marked and Kali Linux is in the tree.



174

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:26.100

So click "OK"



175

00:08:26.100 --> 00:08:28.100

Double click on "Kali"



176

00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:30.700

and it says "Starting"



177

00:08:30.700 --> 00:08:32.200

Now it's running.



178

00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.000

You have a few options here to utilize.



179

00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.500

You can have Live (amd64)



180

00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:42.100

Live (forensic mode)



181

00:08:42.100 --> 00:08:44.200

USB Persistence



182

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:46.100

Live USB Encryted Persistence



183

00:08:46.100 --> 00:08:48.170

or just go ahead and install it.



184

00:08:48.170 --> 00:08:50.600

So what these options are:



185

00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:57.600

You have "Live", which is basically when it runs from the USB stick



186

00:08:57.600 --> 00:08:59.100

or something like that.



187

00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:05.000

Those are just live boots -- Can be USB, CDs, or something of a kind



188

00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.400

where the system is booted from an external device



189

00:09:08.400 --> 00:09:11.300

and that is what people usually do



190

00:09:11.300 --> 00:09:14.610

when they want to access certain services



191

00:09:14.610 --> 00:09:17.500

which are protected by the current

operating system.



192

00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:18.830

So when you bring it down



193

00:09:18.830 --> 00:09:21.830

and when you plug in your USB



194

00:09:21.830 --> 00:09:24.700

and boot the system from the USB stick



195

00:09:24.700 --> 00:09:29.390

your system will not recognize any file

permissions previously set



196

00:09:29.390 --> 00:09:32.710

by the system that was installed there

on the hard drive



197

00:09:32.710 --> 00:09:35.100

or the machine, because it is down



198

00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:39.400

and then you can, I don't know, then you can delete stuff



199

00:09:39.400 --> 00:09:42.000

that the system will not allow you to delete.



200

00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:44.500

This is one of the ways that people had used



201

00:09:44.500 --> 00:09:47.650

to actually delete Internet Explorer in

Windows.



202

00:09:47.650 --> 00:09:50.500

More as a joke than anything els



203

00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.110

Just to prove that it's possible



204

00:09:52.110 --> 00:09:59.000

and this is also one of the ways in which you can pull password files



205

00:09:59.000 --> 00:09:59.790

in Windows



206

00:09:59.790 --> 00:10:02.100

and the decrypt them as well.



207

00:10:02.100 --> 00:10:06.300

So will deal with that a bit later on when we get into advanced stuff



208

00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:07.990

but you have fail-safe mode



209

00:10:07.990 --> 00:10:09.200

Live fail-safe mode



210

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:14.300

Well, every system pretty much has a fails-afe mode today



211

00:10:14.300 --> 00:10:19.800

It's basic boot and it tries to



212

00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:21.779

it just slows the basic things



213

00:10:21.779 --> 00:10:24.300

and this is practically guaranteed to boot



214

00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:25.900

every time you boot in fail-safe mode



215

00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.100

unless you messed something up



216

00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:33.000

that is in a very very very very serious way.



217

00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:35.940

Fail-safe mode will boot almost always.



218

00:10:35.940 --> 00:10:41.200

Forensic mode for investigators and such people.



219

00:10:41.200 --> 00:10:44.600

We're not going to be dealing with it in this fashion



220

00:10:44.600 --> 00:10:46.000

because we don't want the live.



221

00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.750

We want the installed version



222

00:10:47.750 --> 00:10:52.100

and then you have Live USB Persistence.



223

00:10:52.100 --> 00:10:54.740

So this is a very nice feature that you can have.



224

00:10:54.740 --> 00:10:57.430

For example, you can have an operating system.



225

00:10:57.430 --> 00:11:01.200

Kali Linux or many other distros

installed on a USB stick



226

00:11:01.200 --> 00:11:03.589

and you can have a rather large USB

stick



227

00:11:03.589 --> 00:11:07.130

like, I don't know, 256 gigs or something a kind.



228

00:11:07.130 --> 00:11:08.800

It doesn't need to be that big



229

00:11:08.800 --> 00:11:10.000

It can be a lot smaller



230

00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:13.740

but the bigger the better, primarily because of this persistence flag.



231

00:11:13.750 --> 00:11:17.639

You can work and work



232

00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:22.800

and all your work will be saved on that

USB hard drive.



233

00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:28.500

So you can make permanent changes to a live CD.



234

00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:31.000

Well, generally not to a CD.



235

00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:32.800

This is a USB.



236

00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.040

I do believe that there is a way of

doing this for the CD as well



237

00:11:36.040 --> 00:11:38.000

but nobody does that anymore.



238

00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:42.000

Just have a USB stick and you'll be fine.



239

00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.560

You see, the first version



240

00:11:43.560 --> 00:11:44.900

the live one



241

00:11:44.900 --> 00:11:46.200

it means when you take it out



242

00:11:46.200 --> 00:11:47.610

when you shut it down



243

00:11:47.610 --> 00:11:50.370

it will forget any and all changes made

to it



244

00:11:50.370 --> 00:11:53.620

but when you have Live USB with persistence



245

00:11:53.620 --> 00:11:56.500

you can  have those changes remembered.



246

00:11:56.500 --> 00:11:57.500

You can break them down.



247

00:11:57.500 --> 00:12:01.400

So next time you boot it, they will load



248

00:12:01.400 --> 00:12:04.100

and here you have another great option --



249

00:12:04.100 --> 00:12:08.200

It's Live USB Encrypted Persistence.



250

00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:13.500

So what this means is basically that your old information



251

00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:18.100

contained on your live USB will be encrypted



252

00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:19.980

and if you happen to lose it



253

00:12:19.980 --> 00:12:23.000

nobody will be able to access your data.



254

00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.500

So provided of course, that you have something sensitive there



255

00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:26.680

worth protecting



256

00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:31.000

and I mean you would still lose the data



257

00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:37.100

but you would ensure that no one can actually access it



258

00:12:37.100 --> 00:12:38.300

or anything of a kind.



259

00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:39.000

So if you lose it



260

00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000

If you have some passwords or something like that stored there



261

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.400

Oh well, no big deal.



262

00:12:43.400 --> 00:12:45.200

You know, it's encrypted.



263

00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:46.900

Nobody's gonna be able to break it



264

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:48.389

provided of course that you have a long enough encryption key



265

00:12:48.389 --> 00:12:53.400

the long enough encryption key.



266

00:12:53.400 --> 00:12:56.100

In any case, in the follow up tutorial



267

00:12:56.100 --> 00:13:00.500

I will go ahead and proceed with the installation.



268

00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.400

Notice that we will need to install a few more things



269

00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:05.400

because, look at this --



270

00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:07.459

I'm resizing the screen now



271

00:13:07.459 --> 00:13:10.700

and once I go past a certain size



272

00:13:10.700 --> 00:13:13.879

I can no longer increase the size of my screen



273

00:13:13.879 --> 00:13:15.900

of my virtual screen.



274

00:13:15.900 --> 00:13:18.600

Rather instead, I'm just increasing it's edges



275

00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.600

and that is because we need



276

00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:24.200

something called guest additions for VirtualBox.



277

00:13:24.200 --> 00:13:28.610

Guest additions enable full screen displays of virtual machines



278

00:13:28.610 --> 00:13:32.000

but more of that to come in the next tutorial



279

00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:34.400

and I hope I'll see you all there.
