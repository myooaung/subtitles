00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,910
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,910 --> 00:00:04,410
Today I'm just gonna go ahead and start using Hydra immediately.

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:09,599
You can see that I have like a hundred thousand things open down below

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,920
but you don't have to concern yourselves with all of them.

5
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:27,900
Now I have ran command before and I have it here, so let's just go over it

6
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:28,400
but before we do, a quick thing to do is just do "nano passlist"

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:36,969
Excellent

8
00:00:36,969 --> 00:00:40,290
So I've created a password list for myself here.

9
00:00:40,290 --> 00:00:40,790
Now of course, this would be pretty stupid thing to do

10
00:00:40,790 --> 00:00:44,510
if you were actually cracking a password somewhere on a website.

11
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:48,530
Rather instead, you should definitely download a password list from somewhere.

12
00:00:48,530 --> 00:00:51,930
There are plenty of them on the net, just type in "Password lists" for dictionary attacks.

13
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:55,949
You won't find a shortage of them, I guarantee it to you

14
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,320
but why should you do what I did?

15
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,899
Why didn't I just download itfrom the net?

16
00:01:01,899 --> 00:01:11,159
Well, hydra is notorious for not doing what you intended to.

17
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:11,659
I mean, the tool does function

18
00:01:11,659 --> 00:01:17,090
the tool is properly coded, the code is fine

19
00:01:17,090 --> 00:01:21,979
but because of the parameters that people tend to pass to it, especially for HTTP and HTTPS versions of attack

20
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:30,700
when you are attacking a website login form

21
00:01:30,700 --> 00:01:36,520
it gets confused a lot, in between what is a proper user name

22
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:39,860
and what are proper login credentials and what are not, because you need to provide a message to Hydra.

23
00:01:39,860 --> 00:01:45,360
Once it receives that message, it knows that the credentials are false

24
00:01:47,659 --> 00:01:51,380
and every time it doesn't receive that message, it will assume that the credentials are correct.

25
00:01:51,380 --> 00:01:55,770
Hydra doesn't actually do anything else

26
00:01:55,770 --> 00:02:00,600
and because of this, it can get confused a lot

27
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:01,100
and you do need to pass that long URL parameter for login site.

28
00:02:01,100 --> 00:02:07,170
So there are some problems that can happen

29
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:10,690
and that is why it is good to create your own password list that is very short

30
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:16,330
and to test out your attack.

31
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:16,830
Test it out on your local web server or test it out on the server that you wish to attack.

32
00:02:20,570 --> 00:02:25,860
If you can log into that server with some sort of visitor guest account or something like that

33
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:28,750
just create some nonsensical account with nonsensical information there

34
00:02:28,750 --> 00:02:34,660
that would be great

35
00:02:34,660 --> 00:02:35,160
and see if these attacks work.

36
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:35,660
Try out these passwords.

37
00:02:35,660 --> 00:02:39,460
If it finds the right password, great

38
00:02:39,460 --> 00:02:39,960
and don't just run the test once, run it like two or four times

39
00:02:39,960 --> 00:02:45,410
Not in a row preferably, but over a period of two days or something like that, or more

40
00:02:45,410 --> 00:02:51,020
and if both tests find successful passwords

41
00:02:51,020 --> 00:02:55,640
then you know that Hydra is functioning just fine.

42
00:02:55,640 --> 00:02:58,740
What you do not want to do is load up a dictionary of eight million passwords and like 10 million user names

43
00:02:58,740 --> 00:03:04,640
and start your brute forcing attack over the period of a couple of weeks

44
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,730
just to find out in the end that you actually failed to pass the right parameters.

45
00:03:09,730 --> 00:03:10,230
Two weeks of wasted time.

46
00:03:10,230 --> 00:03:15,730
So just create a fire like this. It's pretty simple.

47
00:03:15,730 --> 00:03:20,940
Type in nano, and then space, name of your file just like I've typed in a second ago

48
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:24,680
and then you can type in whatever youwant here.

49
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:26,200
It doesn't really matter

50
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,810
CTRL O to save, press ENTER center for pass list

51
00:03:30,810 --> 00:03:31,310
That's gonna be the name of our pass list here

52
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:35,780
and CTRL X to exit.

53
00:03:35,780 --> 00:03:36,280
You can name it any way you like, quite literally.

54
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:41,010
It doesn't really matter.

55
00:03:41,010 --> 00:03:41,510
Let's go ahead here and clear the screen there.

56
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:47,840
Now what we need to do is find the command that I used

57
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:48,340
Excellent

58
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:56,200
So it says Hydra, and then -l for admin, space -P for password

59
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:57,209
The IP address of the server, the method.

60
00:03:57,209 --> 00:04:02,840
Okay, so there's a difference here -- Previous one was "get". This one is "post"

61
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:09,980
The reason for that --

62
00:04:09,980 --> 00:04:10,480
I'm actually attacking the front login site of the damn vulnerable app with Hydra.

63
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,489
I have discovered some of the complications inside

64
00:04:14,489 --> 00:04:21,330
so I didn't put you through it, as you'll get a lot of errors and problems around it

65
00:04:21,330 --> 00:04:23,200
and generally you won't want that.

66
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:28,080
To be quite honest, that is not a realistic scenario in the first place

67
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,760
primarily because you will have already logged into something

68
00:04:31,760 --> 00:04:32,260
and then while you're logged into something

69
00:04:32,260 --> 00:04:36,030
you want to brute force another login behind the login.

70
00:04:36,030 --> 00:04:42,200
I don't know, I suppose you can find such scenarios in the world

71
00:04:42,200 --> 00:04:46,270
but it is not very likely that you will encounter that.

72
00:04:46,270 --> 00:04:51,350
Far more likely option to encounter is the one that we're seeing here before us

73
00:04:51,350 --> 00:04:56,550
and this is far more realistic anyway.

74
00:04:56,550 --> 00:04:57,050
So I've already attempted to log in and says login failed.

75
00:04:57,050 --> 00:05:05,190
If I reload the site, I'm going to burp suite, so I'm just going to forward this.

76
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:05,690
Excellent

77
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:06,190
So we have this - DVWA

78
00:05:06,190 --> 00:05:10,660
We can copy this, as I have shown you in the previous tutorial.

79
00:05:10,660 --> 00:05:14,630
The procedure is exactly the same. There are no differences here

80
00:05:14,630 --> 00:05:15,130
but I just wanna show you that you can also do this in burp suite in a very nice fashion.

81
00:05:15,130 --> 00:05:19,480
So you can go here into headers

82
00:05:19,480 --> 00:05:24,800
and you can immediately see what you are requesting here.

83
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:33,070
You will, of course, disregard regard the HTTP/1.1 request

84
00:05:33,070 --> 00:05:39,470
Rather instead, you will just copy this first part of this header

85
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:39,970
You got some hex here

86
00:05:39,970 --> 00:05:44,610
that's completely relevant to us

87
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:45,120
but you also have it here.

88
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:50,640
It says get, and then you have it here.

89
00:05:50,640 --> 00:05:51,140
Again in the same form, but you can actually copy/paste from here while from headers.

90
00:05:51,140 --> 00:05:56,080
I don't know, it's possible, but you have to like cut it and do stuff to it.

91
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,210
Here you can just do this, and then copy/paste to wherever you want it.

92
00:06:01,210 --> 00:06:08,540
Anyway, even though the method is "get" to call the website, we are yet to attempt a login.

93
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,800
So if I forward this...

94
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:18,200
Excellent

95
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:21,409
and now I'm going to attempt to log n

96
00:06:21,409 --> 00:06:21,909
Excellent

97
00:06:21,909 --> 00:06:22,409
So you see here, it's a post.

98
00:06:22,409 --> 00:06:32,669
As soon as you don't see your credentials being passed in the URL space of your browser

99
00:06:32,669 --> 00:06:36,269
it should be post, if I'm not mistaken.

100
00:06:36,269 --> 00:06:36,769
If they are passed in the URL, it's "get"

101
00:06:36,769 --> 00:06:42,379
but just try some random login. Just smash on your keyboard

102
00:06:42,379 --> 00:06:42,879
and you can also figure it out on burp suite.

103
00:06:42,879 --> 00:06:45,959
You can use the burp suite in the same way as I've shown you in the previous tutorials

104
00:06:45,959 --> 00:06:49,569
and here you can figure out that it's post

105
00:06:49,569 --> 00:06:50,069
but anyway, you don't actually need to use burp suite

106
00:06:50,069 --> 00:06:53,999
I showed you how you can get it from page source.

107
00:06:53,999 --> 00:06:59,099
Pretty much that is a universal rule for any site out there

108
00:06:59,099 --> 00:07:04,079
and here you can see the username fields and password fields, etc.

109
00:07:04,079 --> 00:07:04,579
You can even get the session ID here

110
00:07:04,579 --> 00:07:08,909
but all of that you can get through your browser.

111
00:07:08,909 --> 00:07:13,849
Also, one more thing to note is that the security is set on high.

112
00:07:13,849 --> 00:07:17,079
Anyway, I'm just going to go ahead and forward this

113
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:17,579
minimize this, as I don't really need it

114
00:07:17,579 --> 00:07:18,079
and come back into the Hydra command.

115
00:07:18,079 --> 00:07:26,469
So, "http-post-form", space

116
00:07:26,469 --> 00:07:27,629
and then I open up my quotation marks.

117
00:07:27,629 --> 00:07:38,159
We need to type in "DVWA-1.0.8/login php

118
00:07:38,159 --> 00:07:38,659
Now, we've actually copied this part up to here

119
00:07:38,659 --> 00:07:44,990
and then I've type in a colon in order to separate the fields.

120
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,439
The next field that I need to use his username

121
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:49,939
Do I still have it here? No

122
00:07:49,939 --> 00:07:58,050
Okay, so it's just easier for me to look at in burp suite now

123
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:02,839
but you can look at it wherever you like, in Firefox as well.

124
00:08:02,839 --> 00:08:11,309
Just go ahead and forward that information.

125
00:08:11,309 --> 00:08:14,769
Will this work? Yup, there we go.

126
00:08:14,769 --> 00:08:21,079
So here you see username=

127
00:08:21,079 --> 00:08:21,579
Again, you can do all of this the way I showed you the previous tutorial.

128
00:08:21,579 --> 00:08:25,789
Just extract information from page source

129
00:08:25,789 --> 00:08:30,439
but it's a bit easier to see them in burp suite.

130
00:08:30,439 --> 00:08:30,939
username=, and then I would of course copy that part

131
00:08:30,939 --> 00:08:34,599
and here you go.

132
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:38,750
Surely enough it says username=

133
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:39,250
I've copied that part.

134
00:08:39,250 --> 00:08:39,750
Now this is the part that belongs to the website

135
00:08:39,750 --> 00:08:44,560
and this part here belongs to Hydra.

136
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:49,980
So you type in ^USER^

137
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:55,680
Now this part tells Hydra where to insert username

138
00:08:55,680 --> 00:09:01,910
and this is the field name on the website, equals, and then Hydra will insert values there

139
00:09:01,910 --> 00:09:08,519
and "&password"

140
00:09:08,519 --> 00:09:09,019
Again, in  burp suite, you can see that it's actually n percent sign and then password.

141
00:09:09,019 --> 00:09:13,839
Forget about these.

142
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:17,500
This random value here.

143
00:09:17,500 --> 00:09:18,000
This is just a username that I've basically smashed my fingers against the keyboard

144
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:21,750
and attempted to log in, just to get this form here

145
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:25,970
and that I just get this information here that I am utilizing now.

146
00:09:34,029 --> 00:09:36,519
So the extension of this field is basically "&password="

147
00:09:36,519 --> 00:09:43,550
and then we have it here again

148
00:09:43,550 --> 00:09:46,699
We open up carrots signs.

149
00:09:46,699 --> 00:09:47,199
Basically like quotation, but I don't know, they said it's gonna be carrot signs

150
00:09:47,199 --> 00:09:53,060
and in between them, just type in PASS

151
00:09:53,060 --> 00:09:57,860
Write it exactly as I've type in here.

152
00:09:57,860 --> 00:09:58,360
So for password, it's PASS

153
00:09:58,360 --> 00:10:02,389
and for username, it's USER

154
00:10:02,389 --> 00:10:07,560
but these field names, I suppose they can be changed

155
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,959
depending on what the developer has intended them to be, but it doesn't matter.

156
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,509
I don't know, instead of password, you can say pin or something of a kind

157
00:10:16,509 --> 00:10:21,370
but you do need to check that with a website

158
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,180
and the source code of the website you can view by right-click View Source

159
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:25,680
or use a burp suite proxies, as I've shown in the previous tutorials.

160
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:30,529
and then you will be able to figure it out.

161
00:10:30,529 --> 00:10:35,350
So pass the password

162
00:10:35,350 --> 00:10:40,550
You have "&login"

163
00:10:40,550 --> 00:10:41,050
So let's just go to the burp suite and see what's up there.

164
00:10:41,050 --> 00:10:44,320
So it does really say that the extension of this field is &login, and it equals login

165
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:50,600
It is so indeed and we copy/paste it here.

166
00:10:50,600 --> 00:10:55,790
There is no need to actually do any alterations there.

167
00:10:55,790 --> 00:11:00,370
Login Hydra will not insert anything there.

168
00:11:00,370 --> 00:11:08,980
The third field that we need to pass

169
00:11:08,980 --> 00:11:09,480
This is one field

170
00:11:09,480 --> 00:11:18,550
This is the second field

171
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:19,050
and this will be a third field.

172
00:11:19,050 --> 00:11:26,330
The third field actually is the marker field.

173
00:11:26,330 --> 00:11:30,500
That is something that Hydra is looking for, and if it gets that

174
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:35,650
It knows that it's an invalid combination of a username and the passwords.

175
00:11:35,650 --> 00:11:40,710
It says here at the bottom of page "login failed"

176
00:11:40,710 --> 00:11:45,140
So just try to find some message after you have typed in some random credentials and press login.

177
00:11:45,140 --> 00:11:50,350
Find a message that basically says "login failed"

178
00:11:50,350 --> 00:11:53,830
This login failed can be on any portion of the site, but it will be there.

179
00:11:53,830 --> 00:11:58,190
Don't worry about it. There is always a message when you fail to log in.

180
00:11:58,190 --> 00:12:05,890
So you just copy/paste that message here.

181
00:12:05,890 --> 00:12:10,930
Okay, so you can obviously copy it from here, but you can also view selection source

182
00:12:10,930 --> 00:12:14,210
and then you got login failed there as well.

183
00:12:14,210 --> 00:12:19,070
I can't actually click on view page source here.

184
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:19,570
It's still loading or messing up with burp suite, I guess

185
00:12:19,570 --> 00:12:25,800
but it does not really matter.

186
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:26,300
This message won't be the same/

187
00:12:26,300 --> 00:12:31,580
It will vary from one site to next, and its position will vary from one site to the next

188
00:12:31,580 --> 00:12:35,520
and even if I have shown you the source code for this particular site

189
00:12:35,520 --> 00:12:38,720
I mean, you can see it yourselves it's going to be in one place

190
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:39,220
but just try opening up any other site

191
00:12:39,220 --> 00:12:43,649
and do a deliberate failed login.

192
00:12:43,649 --> 00:12:47,579
Just type in some random credentials and then you right-click View Source.

193
00:12:47,579 --> 00:12:51,040
You will see that you get a different message.

194
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:51,540
It doesn't necessarily have to say login failed.

195
00:12:51,540 --> 00:12:56,499
It can just say failed or incorrect username and password or something of a kind.

196
00:12:56,499 --> 00:13:00,449
The messages will be different.

197
00:13:00,449 --> 00:13:00,949
There is no direct procedure to determine this other than by just reasoning.

198
00:13:00,949 --> 00:13:05,059
Just take a look at your screen and just view the message

199
00:13:05,059 --> 00:13:10,389
then view the source code and copy it from there.

200
00:13:12,550 --> 00:13:16,040
Anyway, quotations closed here base

201
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,610
space,  -V for verbose output.

202
00:13:22,610 --> 00:13:23,110
Why capital V? I think that's for extra verbose output, if I'm not mistaken.

203
00:13:23,110 --> 00:13:25,970
I think that's why I placed it there, but I'm pretty sure that the lower case would function the same.

204
00:13:25,970 --> 00:13:31,899
Anyway, if I press ENTER now, this is gonna go and work

205
00:13:31,899 --> 00:13:37,959
even though there are just a few...

206
00:13:37,959 --> 00:13:38,459
You see actually it tries them all out

207
00:13:38,459 --> 00:13:43,689
because the amount of threads that it's running is 16.

208
00:13:43,689 --> 00:13:48,980
You increase the amount of threads by adding a -T space.

209
00:13:48,980 --> 00:13:49,480
I think it supports a maximum of 6432 threads, I'm not sure.

210
00:13:49,480 --> 00:13:55,370
It also depends on your actual computer.

211
00:13:55,370 --> 00:13:55,870
How much it can handle.

212
00:13:55,870 --> 00:14:03,249
Anyway, it says on port 80 [http-post-form]

213
00:14:03,249 --> 00:14:09,809
and then it says login:admin, password is password

214
00:14:09,809 --> 00:14:10,309
Now it is always a good idea to do a lot of research prior to doing this

215
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,899
primarily because you won't necessarily have some sort of complex login credentials

216
00:14:19,899 --> 00:14:22,850
because they are rarely found anywhere

217
00:14:22,850 --> 00:14:28,279
primarily because people don't bother with that

218
00:14:28,279 --> 00:14:28,779
but you will want to know more about those login credentials.

219
00:14:28,779 --> 00:14:33,079
You will want to learn at least something before you attempt to do this sort of attack

220
00:14:33,079 --> 00:14:37,720
because if you know nothing, this sort of attack can last for an eternity of time

221
00:14:37,720 --> 00:14:41,240
and you're most likely gonna get discovered by the administrator.

222
00:14:41,240 --> 00:14:47,220
Also I advise you to use this in combination with some sort of proxy or something of a kind.

223
00:14:47,220 --> 00:14:51,089
Also a very nice thing to do is to go ahead and click on applications.

224
00:14:54,610 --> 00:15:00,230
Kali Linux, Passwords Attacks, Online Attacks, Hydra-gtk

225
00:15:00,230 --> 00:15:05,920
and here you have a graphical user interface for Hydra

226
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,410
Here you can choose like single target, target list, specify a port

227
00:15:10,410 --> 00:15:15,930
You can specify all these things by a command line as well.

228
00:15:15,930 --> 00:15:20,339
You can specify a protocol here.

229
00:15:20,339 --> 00:15:26,320
Down here you can say ssl, use the ssl, be verbose, show attempts, debug, complete help

230
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,899
and at the bottom of this screen that I am spinning now

231
00:15:30,899 --> 00:15:35,490
you can see the actual command is down there.

232
00:15:35,490 --> 00:15:35,990
That command changes as you change value.

233
00:15:35,990 --> 00:15:40,570
So I'm gonna say ftp

234
00:15:40,570 --> 00:15:41,070
You can see it changed to ftp.

235
00:15:41,070 --> 00:15:45,910
I'm gonna say HTTP proxy

236
00:15:45,910 --> 00:15:46,410
It's also changed, but you can't see the whole thing.

237
00:15:46,410 --> 00:15:46,910
Now it says HTTP proxy

238
00:15:46,910 --> 00:15:50,170
The letters are pretty small here, but doesn't really matter.

239
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:53,230
Just take a look at this graphical user interface too if you are interested.

240
00:15:53,230 --> 00:15:53,730
All of these things you can do by command line.

241
00:15:53,730 --> 00:15:54,230
All of them. There's no difference there.

242
00:15:54,230 --> 00:15:58,100
You can specify a user name, user name list, password, use colon separated file

243
00:15:58,100 --> 00:16:02,810
try login as password, try empty password, try reverse login

244
00:16:02,810 --> 00:16:05,790
Pretty much self explanatory things.

245
00:16:05,790 --> 00:16:10,240
Number of tasks here it's set to default to 16, but you can increase.

246
00:16:10,740 --> 00:16:14,980
You can also tell it to exit after first pair found per host

247
00:16:14,980 --> 00:16:18,980
if you're passing of filed multiple hosts

248
00:16:18,980 --> 00:16:19,480
and you can say at exit after first pair found on a global level.

249
00:16:19,480 --> 00:16:24,399
So if you find some login credentials for any of the hosts, just stop.

250
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:33,790
Here you can specify a proxy to be used.

251
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:34,290
Not a bad idea either.

252
00:16:34,290 --> 00:16:42,000
Where it says HTTP/HTTPS URL, there you would pass these parameters

253
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:47,100
There you would pass what is in the quotation marks here, or something of a kind, if I'm not mistaken

254
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:52,600
but I'm just showing you this if you're curious, so feel free to explore

255
00:16:52,600 --> 00:16:58,000
and here it starts.

256
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:03,160
It says Start, Stop, Save Output, Clear Output

257
00:17:03,160 --> 00:17:03,660
Clear Output clears the screen and Save Output saves it to a file.

258
00:17:03,660 --> 00:17:07,030
Self-explanatory as well

259
00:17:07,030 --> 00:17:11,130
Anyway, I just wanted to show you that

260
00:17:11,130 --> 00:17:11,630
as I said, if you are curious or something of a kind

261
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:16,870
but this is how you should use the command line tool via terminal.

262
00:17:16,870 --> 00:17:21,880
Always better to learn it this way

263
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:22,380
Always better to use it this way

264
00:17:22,380 --> 00:17:25,430
but if you wanna play around with the graphics as well, feel free to do so.

265
00:17:25,430 --> 00:17:25,930
I do encourage you to do both.

266
00:17:25,930 --> 00:17:34,200
Anyway, I bid you all farewell

267
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:34,700
and I urge you to experiment more with Hydra.

268
00:17:34,700 --> 00:17:38,070
Try different parameters, try different places legally

269
00:17:38,070 --> 00:17:45,970
and see how that works out for you

270
00:17:45,970 --> 00:17:46,470
because this part will continuously change

271
00:17:46,470 --> 00:17:51,700
and it will be different from one website to the other.

272
00:17:51,700 --> 00:17:55,610
This part won't change, this part won't change

273
00:17:55,610 --> 00:17:56,110
but everything else within the quotation marks will pretty much change from one website to the other.

274
00:18:00,190 --> 00:18:04,950
This part is straightforward, as I said.

275
00:18:04,950 --> 00:18:05,450
There isn't that much thought that you need to invest here.

276
00:18:05,450 --> 00:18:10,260
It's fairly easy, but invest a lot of time into figuring this part out

277
00:18:10,260 --> 00:18:13,790
and once that works out, the rest is easy.

278
00:18:13,790 --> 00:18:14,290
It's always gonna work, no problems.

279
00:18:14,290 --> 00:18:19,550
Anyway, now I bid you farewell

280
00:18:19,550 --> 00:18:21,000
and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
