1
00:00:00,100 --> 00:00:03,100
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:06,800
Today I will continue with the installation of Kali Linux

3
00:00:06,800 --> 00:00:09,000
within a virtual environment.

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:12,710
You might have noticed that I have two screens

5
00:00:12,710 --> 00:00:14,700
on which is  written "Kali Linux"

6
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:16,300
and they are exactly the same

7
00:00:16,300 --> 00:00:22,100
except one has a bigger font and a zoomed-in picture, so to say.

8
00:00:22,100 --> 00:00:25,000
Over here on left side, this is my virtual machine

9
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:26,500
the window that I am moving now.

10
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,550
This is the actual virtual machine

11
00:00:28,550 --> 00:00:31,000
and the window on the right side

12
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:36,800
that is just a zooming in app that I have installed in order for you

13
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,700
to able to better see what I am about to show you here

14
00:00:40,700 --> 00:00:44,100
primarily because I don't have guest additions installed

15
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:45,100
in the virtual machine

16
00:00:45,100 --> 00:00:46,329
that you cannot install them

17
00:00:46,329 --> 00:00:52,100
until you actually install the operating system first.

18
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:54,300
Therefore I can't zoom in on anything.

19
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:57,200
I cannot perform any operations of the kind

20
00:00:57,200 --> 00:01:01,200
and you can see that the font on the left side is rather small

21
00:01:01,200 --> 00:01:03,700
and a bit difficult to see.

22
00:01:03,700 --> 00:01:05,400
Therefore you can...

23
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:08,000
I will perform the work there on the
left side

24
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,100
and you can monitor what I'm doing on the right.

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:14,800
There is no difference between left and right in terms of actions

26
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:17,520
only in the in terms of font-size.

27
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,600
Anyway I'm just gonna go ahead and
scroll down to install.

28
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:23,400
Press "Enter"

29
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
That is what want

30
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:28,140
and the installation procedure is under way.

31
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:32,340
By the way, if you boot into live version

32
00:01:32,340 --> 00:01:39,400
the default password for root is just root in reverse, so "toor"

33
00:01:39,400 --> 00:01:41,800
Just a bit a brief mention there.

34
00:01:41,800 --> 00:01:44,900
A bit of extra info that I wanted to throw in there

35
00:01:44,900 --> 00:01:48,100
that might come in handy from time to time.

36
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:51,500
Anyway, pick whatever language is suitable for you.

37
00:01:51,500 --> 00:01:54,700
You can also take the uppermost option

38
00:01:54,700 --> 00:01:59,280
where it says "C No localization"

39
00:01:59,290 --> 00:02:02,600
So if you want a greater degree of
anonymity, or something of a kind

40
00:02:02,600 --> 00:02:03,670
you can even pic that

41
00:02:03,670 --> 00:02:07,300
but for the sake of this tutorial, there really isn't any need

42
00:02:07,300 --> 00:02:09,400
and even if you do pick a language

43
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:13,400
I mean, a lot of people pick English

44
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:17,800
so that will not footprint you or anything of a kind.

45
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:18,960
Just press "Enter"

46
00:02:18,960 --> 00:02:25,500
and here you can actually choose a country, territory, or area.

47
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:29,970
Well, I don't know, you can choose whatever you want here.

48
00:02:29,970 --> 00:02:32,500
I'm just gonna go ahead and click "UK"

49
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:37,400
because it immediately offers me a British keyboard that I use.

50
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:39,800
So that's very nice in terms of settings

51
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,600
but again, you could have chosen "No localization"

52
00:02:42,600 --> 00:02:47,000
and this, you would not be asked any of these things.

53
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:49,050
Well, for keyboard you probably would

54
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:53,690
but for the country, area, or anything
of a kind you would not.

55
00:02:53,690 --> 00:02:57,700
In any case, even if you don't pick the
right one here, it doesn't matter.

56
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:02,600
Later on, after the installation, you can configure it anyway you like

57
00:03:02,600 --> 00:03:04,500
but it's very nice to do it straight away

58
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:07,500
saves a bit of work later on.

59
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:12,100
Anyway, the installation is now underway.

60
00:03:12,100 --> 00:03:15,500
I'm just gotta unbind my mouse.

61
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:17,610
It seems to get stuck in a loop there.

62
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:21,300
Basically, you bind and unbind your
keys

63
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:24,190
by simply put pressing the right control key.

64
00:03:24,190 --> 00:03:30,200
That is how you control the mouse

65
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:35,630
Let's just move this a bit so you can see it better.

66
00:03:35,630 --> 00:03:39,620
There we go.

67
00:03:39,620 --> 00:03:42,489
Anyway, there's some other configuration going on now.

68
00:03:42,489 --> 00:03:46,500
Nothing really noteworthy, so to say.

69
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:47,900
Let me just change this a bit.

70
00:03:47,900 --> 00:03:48,650
There we go

71
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:51,659
and you can pick a host name here

72
00:03:51,660 --> 00:03:55,300
unless you have some sort of specific
preferences

73
00:03:55,310 --> 00:03:59,739
and you actually have a registered host name or something of a kind

74
00:03:59,739 --> 00:04:02,290
which you do not want to use here, by the way.

75
00:04:02,290 --> 00:04:05,400
You can just leave it as default.

76
00:04:05,400 --> 00:04:07,400
You can leave Kali

77
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,300
or you can actually write whatever you want your computer to be called.

78
00:04:14,300 --> 00:04:18,100
So I'm just gonna leave the default

79
00:04:18,100 --> 00:04:25,980
but as I said, you can write whatever you wish to write there, no problems

80
00:04:25,980 --> 00:04:30,100
So, let's just go ahead on to continue.

81
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:32,700
By the way, you don't have a mouse option here

82
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:34,100
while you're doing this installation.

83
00:04:34,100 --> 00:04:35,200
So tab

84
00:04:35,200 --> 00:04:39,700
Pressing "Tab" switches between fields and options

85
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,979
If you press "Space"

86
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:46,400
that means you're marking the field and tab means switching fields.

87
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,900
So you use tab, space, and enter to actually call a function

88
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:53,349
to execute something.

89
00:04:53,349 --> 00:04:57,000
In this case, I'm just gonna say "Continue"

90
00:04:57,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Here, you can type in your domain name.

91
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:01,900
No I do not want a domain name at this time.

92
00:05:01,900 --> 00:05:05,200
Keep in mind that you can configure this later on as well

93
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:07,900
should there be a need for it.

94
00:05:07,900 --> 00:05:09,460
Just click on "Continue"

95
00:05:09,460 --> 00:05:11,000
or hit "Enter"

96
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:12,530
Now, root password

97
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:16,950
I would suggest picking something ridiculously complex and complicated

98
00:05:16,950 --> 00:05:23,100
and lot of people worry that they won't remember their passwords

99
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:25,880
if they're long and complicated or
something of a kind

100
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:30,400
but assign a certain logic to your
password.

101
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,900
Something that reflects the way you think

102
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:40,100
and then the password can gain in length

103
00:05:40,100 --> 00:05:42,300
and you can still manage to remember it.

104
00:05:42,300 --> 00:05:47,200
So for example, you can insert a certain word that you use

105
00:05:47,200 --> 00:05:50,200
that you use or that you're attached to or something like that.

106
00:05:50,200 --> 00:05:53,110
Something that you like but you don't need to type the word

107
00:05:53,110 --> 00:05:56,000
You don't need to spell the word correctly in the English language.

108
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,100
Rather instead, you can spell incorrectly

109
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,500
and then add, I don't know,  like exclamation marks

110
00:06:03,500 --> 00:06:04,300
question marks

111
00:06:04,300 --> 00:06:08,000
greater than signs, lesser than signs, add signs

112
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:09,200
and so on and so forth

113
00:06:09,200 --> 00:06:11,500
but figure out something that refelcts your logic

114
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:13,000
your way of thinking

115
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:15,770
and make sure that it is above eight characters.

116
00:06:15,770 --> 00:06:18,910
Like, above eight characters is a
must-have.

117
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:23,850
It needs to contain capital letters.

118
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,350
A few of them, not just one.

119
00:06:26,350 --> 00:06:30,000
You need also a different form of signs

120
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:32,700
You cannot use just one sign -- that's not a good idea.

121
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:37,500
You need to use like three or four of them, in the mixture.

122
00:06:37,500 --> 00:06:39,000
The more, the better

123
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:42,130
and don't just type in word in English language

124
00:06:42,130 --> 00:06:43,400
and then type in numbers

125
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:45,000
and then type in signs.

126
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:48,500
So you are already assigning a very strict order

127
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,000
so any brute forcing attack will go much easier

128
00:06:53,000 --> 00:06:54,300
if you do something like that.

129
00:06:54,300 --> 00:06:56,300
Rather instead, try to have a mixture

130
00:06:56,300 --> 00:06:58,430
Try to randomize the position of the types of characters

131
00:06:58,430 --> 00:07:03,320
that you're gonna put in your password.

132
00:07:03,320 --> 00:07:05,700
Give some thought to this.

133
00:07:05,700 --> 00:07:08,000
Don't just type in something at random.

134
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,900
Don't just type in something easy here.

135
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:13,200
Just give some thought to it for the time being.

136
00:07:13,200 --> 00:07:15,030
For the sake of the tutorial

137
00:07:15,030 --> 00:07:18,000
I'm going to use one of the dumbest passwords possible.

138
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:20,000
I'm going to type in "Test"

139
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,760
That's gonna be the password of this virtual machine

140
00:07:22,760 --> 00:07:26,160
and then I'm gonna hit the "Continue" button

141
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:29,620
but it's gonna ask you to verify it

142
00:07:29,620 --> 00:07:32,800
by forcing you to reenter it

143
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:34,000
and there we go.

144
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:35,000
It's going

145
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,100
but once again, I emphasize USE A STRONG PASSWORD

146
00:07:40,129 --> 00:07:42,000
Above eight characters

147
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:47,009
plus with characters and capital letters as well.

148
00:07:47,009 --> 00:07:50,199
So now we have partitioning methods

149
00:07:50,199 --> 00:07:52,600
and if this was my main machine if this
left post machine

150
00:07:52,600 --> 00:07:53,969
if this was my host machine

151
00:07:53,969 --> 00:07:56,900
I would definitely do this manually

152
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:00,600
I would want my partitions to be configured in a certain way

153
00:08:00,600 --> 00:08:02,699
but since this is a virtual machine

154
00:08:02,699 --> 00:08:07,000
I'm just gonna go ahead and say "Guided - use entire disk"

155
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,360
it doesn't matter to me as there is only one partition anyway

156
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,439
and it's 138 gigs.

157
00:08:13,439 --> 00:08:15,900
It's pretty much better like this

158
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,400
as we don't really have any legit need for  anything of a kind

159
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:21,800
unless you wanted to set some sort of encryption

160
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:22,919
or something of a kind.

161
00:08:22,919 --> 00:08:25,000
Press "Enter"

162
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:26,969
All files in one partition.

163
00:08:26,969 --> 00:08:29,300
Recommended for new users.

164
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:30,200
Sure, we can do that.

165
00:08:30,200 --> 00:08:31,700
You can separate home partition.

166
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:33,560
You can separate all the partitions.

167
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:37,620
For example, this is something that I did on my host machine.

168
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:41,000
You have a lot of things that are separate

169
00:08:41,000 --> 00:08:46,200
and my main drives are also fully encrypted.

170
00:08:46,209 --> 00:08:48,000
So it would

171
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,000
even if I lost my laptop, or worst -- it got stolen

172
00:08:51,000 --> 00:08:54,000
it would be really difficult to access pretty much anything.

173
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:57,720
Even the BIOS is locked, so you can't even reinstall it.

174
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:01,310
You would literally have to open up the laptop

175
00:09:01,310 --> 00:09:02,800
take the BIOS battery out

176
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,100
which is underneath my main
processor

177
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:13,199
and you're more likely to basically
permanently damage the motherboard

178
00:09:13,199 --> 00:09:17,199
then you are to actually remove and put back that battery

179
00:09:17,199 --> 00:09:21,639
in order to reset the BIOS.

180
00:09:21,639 --> 00:09:26,079
That's one of the very nice fail-safes for devices

181
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:29,700
especially for compact laptops

182
00:09:29,700 --> 00:09:32,600
but in this case, we don't need any of that

183
00:09:32,600 --> 00:09:36,300
primarily because such configuration and such things

184
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:38,300
are done on the host machine.

185
00:09:38,300 --> 00:09:40,550
You encrypt your partitions there

186
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:44,000
you lock the BIOS there, and so on and
so forth.

187
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:46,700
While on the other hand, with virtual
machines

188
00:09:46,700 --> 00:09:49,029
there is no need to do anything other kind

189
00:09:49,029 --> 00:09:54,300
primarily because the host machines are the fail-safe.

190
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:57,000
If that fails, everything else will fail.

191
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,339
So you don't need to worry about it.

192
00:10:00,339 --> 00:10:04,800
You don't need to add those unnecessary layers, I would say

193
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:07,300
primarily because they're gonna slow you down

194
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:09,300
in the greater scheme of things.

195
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:10,529
So press "Enter"

196
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:14,399
Finish partitioning and break changes to disk.

197
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,000
Before I do that, let me just go ahead

198
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:20,920
and explain the partitioning scheme here.

199
00:10:20,920 --> 00:10:23,000
or partitioning layout here.

200
00:10:23,000 --> 00:10:26,800
So you have primary hash 1

201
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,100
Primary 126.5 gigabytes

202
00:10:30,100 --> 00:10:34,920
space F, space ext4, space slash

203
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:38,300
Now all these things have a meaning

204
00:10:38,300 --> 00:10:42,700
but what you need to know is that, like in Windows

205
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:44,800
you have NTFS partitioning.

206
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:46,600
NTFS partitions.

207
00:10:46,600 --> 00:10:51,000
In Linux, you have "ext4" partitions.

208
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:52,730
They are a bit faster.

209
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:56,300
That's one thing that goes in the favor of Linux

210
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:04,300
and you also, during the partitioning of the disk with a Linux system

211
00:11:04,300 --> 00:11:07,100
there is only one partition which is a
must-have

212
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:09,700
which is an absolute requirement

213
00:11:09,700 --> 00:11:13,600
and that is this first partition that I have selected.

214
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:16,000
It's marcation is just "slash"

215
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,900
That is the root partition and you always need to configure it.

216
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,400
Without it, manual partitioning will not work.

217
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:31,000
You will get error messages saying that you must specify a root partition.

218
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,200
Down below we have "Swap"

219
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,089
Swap is basically a fail-safe method.

220
00:11:37,089 --> 00:11:40,000
So when you run out of RAM memory

221
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,400
you basically tell your system

222
00:11:42,400 --> 00:11:48,190
"Okay, you can have this portion of the hard drive and you can use it as RAM"

223
00:11:48,190 --> 00:11:51,500
which functions in a very slow matter

224
00:11:51,500 --> 00:11:54,400
but it will prevent your machine from crashing.

225
00:11:54,400 --> 00:12:01,980
Usually swap partitions are configured to the double size of your RAM

226
00:12:01,980 --> 00:12:05,839
My RAM is 8 gigabytes, but here by default

227
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:10,430
the computer has assigned 4
because this is a virtual machine

228
00:12:10,430 --> 00:12:12,200
and if you remember at the beginning

229
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:15,800
I have assigned two gigabytes of RAM to this virtual machine.

230
00:12:15,800 --> 00:12:17,600
So you just multiply it by two.

231
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:18,800
It wasn't exactly two.

232
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:22,200
It was just above two and it has multiplied by two

233
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:26,000
so I get 4.3 gigabytes of swap space

234
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:28,430
Now of the modern systems

235
00:12:28,430 --> 00:12:30,000
on most of the modern computers

236
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:32,660
you will not require swap partitions

237
00:12:32,660 --> 00:12:35,200
even though if you don't make it, you'll get a warning

238
00:12:35,200 --> 00:12:39,500
but rare are the cases when you will need a swap partition

239
00:12:39,500 --> 00:12:44,800
when you will waste all eight gigabytes of RAM, or something of a kind.

240
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,200
I mean, it happens to me from time to time

241
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,800
but usually if it happens there's something wrong with the system.

242
00:12:49,800 --> 00:12:52,089
I don't want it to continue consuming resources.

243
00:12:52,089 --> 00:12:54,700
I want it to stop there

244
00:12:54,700 --> 00:13:03,000
Anyway, now that you know what some of these options here mean

245
00:13:03,000 --> 00:13:07,300
you have marcation for the disk here -- It's "sda"

246
00:13:07,300 --> 00:13:10,180
but we'll get into that later as we configure the system.

247
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:12,900
So you also have some other options here.

248
00:13:12,900 --> 00:13:14,880
It says "Configure encrypted volumes"

249
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:16,940
"Configure the Logical Volume Manager"

250
00:13:16,940 --> 00:13:19,000
LVM

251
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,130
"Configure software RAID"

252
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:23,590
and you can go back to "Guided
partitioning"

253
00:13:23,590 --> 00:13:29,200
So these are all very nice options that come for free

254
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:31,600
and you I think "Oh, well that's no big deal"

255
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:32,590
or something of a kind

256
00:13:32,590 --> 00:13:34,000
but believe me when I tell you

257
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,870
these things in proprietary operating systems

258
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,800
they cost a lot of money.

259
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:46,000
While here, they are free and generally work better.

260
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:49,100
What we will be interested in today will not be RAID

261
00:13:49,100 --> 00:13:51,300
because we don't actually need it.

262
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:53,900
You can configure encrypted volumes as well.

263
00:13:53,900 --> 00:13:57,940
I will demonstrate in a later time
encryption methods.

264
00:13:57,940 --> 00:14:02,000
You don't need to encrypt your volumes in a virtual machine

265
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:04,270
but you can encrypt certain files or folders

266
00:14:04,270 --> 00:14:07,340
if you don't want to grant access to them.

267
00:14:07,340 --> 00:14:12,800
However, my hard drives here on my host machine are encrypted

268
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,000
so I am pretty safe in that regard.

269
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:20,400
I'm just gonna go ahead now to the bottom, press "Enter"

270
00:14:20,400 --> 00:14:23,150
and finish partitioning and write changes to disk.

271
00:14:23,150 --> 00:14:25,700
Excellent

272
00:14:25,700 --> 00:14:27,700
So now

273
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:30,080
Oops

274
00:14:30,080 --> 00:14:33,880
Let me just move this a little bit so you
can see it.

275
00:14:33,880 --> 00:14:37,710
Basically it is asking me for a
confirmation.

276
00:14:37,710 --> 00:14:39,400
So if you continue

277
00:14:39,400 --> 00:14:42,700
the changes listed below will be written to discs.

278
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:46,000
Otherwise you will be able to make further changes manually.

279
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:50,000
Now it is informing me of the changes to be made

280
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:55,680
and telling me basically that all the information will be lost

281
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:57,900
should there be anything there

282
00:14:57,900 --> 00:15:01,600
and you can see that by default, it is set to "no"

283
00:15:01,600 --> 00:15:04,000
so that you don't press enter by mistake

284
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:07,600
and erase pretty much all the data on your disk

285
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:09,000
because this installation

286
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:10,870
this ISO file that you are installing

287
00:15:10,870 --> 00:15:14,000
it does not know that it's being
installed in a virtual machine

288
00:15:14,000 --> 00:15:17,000
on which nothing pretty much exists

289
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:18,700
and there is nothing to be lost.

290
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:21,000
So, write changes to disks.

291
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:22,300
Yes

292
00:15:22,300 --> 00:15:25,089
Go ahead and continue with the procedure.

293
00:15:25,089 --> 00:15:29,000
The installation process is now underway

294
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:35,700
and this is going to take awhile, I can tell you that much.

295
00:15:35,700 --> 00:15:41,000
So while this is going on, I just wanna go ahead and pause the video here

296
00:15:41,000 --> 00:15:44,160
and finish this tutorial

297
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,450
In the next tutorial, once the installation is complete

298
00:15:47,450 --> 00:15:51,360
I will actually get into Kali, start configuring it

299
00:15:51,360 --> 00:15:55,000
and introduce you to its interface.

300
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:59,900
In any case, I bid you farewell and I hope to see you all in the next tutorial.
