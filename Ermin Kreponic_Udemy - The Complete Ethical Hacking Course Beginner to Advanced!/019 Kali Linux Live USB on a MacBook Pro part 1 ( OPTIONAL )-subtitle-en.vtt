00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.380

Welcome back everybody.



2

00:00:03.415 --> 00:00:07.684

First off, let me apologize for

getting the tutorials out so late



3

00:00:07.719 --> 00:00:10.995

but I've been struggling with this on end.



4

00:00:12.570 --> 00:00:15.412

Due to the fact that I've

encountered so many problems



5

00:00:16.508 --> 00:00:20.044

while creating a Live USB for a Mac



6

00:00:21.449 --> 00:00:23.285

I do not recommend this set-up at all.



7

00:00:24.158 --> 00:00:26.408

But since some of you have asked for the procedure



8

00:00:26.443 --> 00:00:28.069

I'm gonna do it too anyway.



9

00:00:28.104 --> 00:00:32.773

Be warned that you can

permanently damage your Mac,



10

00:00:33.786 --> 00:00:37.066

that it can literally go down.



11

00:00:37.101 --> 00:00:42.636

The only thing that you'll be

able to do afterwards is reinstall it.



12

00:00:43.626 --> 00:00:45.821

So I would advise you to get a back-up



13

00:00:46.769 --> 00:00:49.238

and if you absolutely don't have to do this



14

00:00:50.448 --> 00:00:53.454

I mean, I wouldn't recommend

it. That's what I'm trying to say.



15

00:00:53.489 --> 00:00:54.995

As it can cause a lot of problems for you



16

00:00:55.030 --> 00:00:58.763

and it can be a very painful experience.



17

00:00:59.843 --> 00:01:02.935

I will set out the procedure,

I've simplified it somewhat



18

00:01:02.970 --> 00:01:06.017

and you don't have to go into

the forums and so on and so forth,



19

00:01:07.348 --> 00:01:12.161

hopefully that is, so you'll be

able to do it, but be warned.



20

00:01:12.196 --> 00:01:16.538

I wish to build a fence

around myself here, so to say.



21

00:01:17.682 --> 00:01:21.993

On a 2013 in your Macs,

this shouldn't be a problem



22

00:01:22.028 --> 00:01:25.261

at all, you'll be able to

do a fairly simple procedure,



23

00:01:25.296 --> 00:01:28.025

a lot simpler than this, but on older Macs,



24

00:01:28.060 --> 00:01:30.806

I'm afraid that the

procedure is somewhat different



25

00:01:31.429 --> 00:01:33.940

and a bit more complicated and does carry in it



26

00:01:33.975 --> 00:01:38.953

an inherent risk that you might

mess your Mac up permanently.



27

00:01:38.988 --> 00:01:44.471

You will have to reinstall and do stuff like that.



28

00:01:45.376 --> 00:01:46.809

Just a suggestion.



29

00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:54.021

For 2013 Macs here's a...



30

00:01:55.049 --> 00:01:57.634

I'm not gonna go

through that as it's fairly simple.



31

00:01:57.644 --> 00:01:59.683

You need a Mac Linux USB loader.



32

00:01:59.718 --> 00:02:03.170

You can get it from Seven Hub, I think.



33

00:02:03.205 --> 00:02:06.618

This is Unetbootin, we're gonna need that for



34

00:02:06.653 --> 00:02:10.726

later, but first off, let's go with the USB loaders,



35

00:02:10.761 --> 00:02:14.842

so "mac usb loader".



36

00:02:17.742 --> 00:02:22.023

SevenBits. GitHub. There you go.



37

00:02:22.058 --> 00:02:25.391

You can get it from here,

just download it, that's it.



38

00:02:25.426 --> 00:02:27.034

You all know how to download a file.



39

00:02:27.069 --> 00:02:31.446

You can see it here, it's in the Downloads folder,



40

00:02:31.481 --> 00:02:34.874

move it to your Applications folder,



41

00:02:36.063 --> 00:02:37.102

so it should be here.



42

00:02:38.343 --> 00:02:40.934

I assure you it is here, I just can't find it.



43

00:02:40.969 --> 00:02:43.583

Ah, there we go. So Mac Linux USB Loader,



44

00:02:43.618 --> 00:02:46.103

you can see it there,

I've got the Mac ports above.



45

00:02:46.138 --> 00:02:49.013

So it says Mac Linux USB Loader.



46

00:02:52.073 --> 00:02:54.427

You won't be able to start it, or use it until...



47

00:02:54.462 --> 00:02:58.639

or at least I don't believe

that you will be able to do it



48

00:02:58.674 --> 00:03:02.039

until you actually go into System Preferences,



49

00:03:02.074 --> 00:03:05.899

Security & Privacy, unlock this.



50

00:03:09.495 --> 00:03:13.368

And then, allow apps downloaded from anywhere.



51

00:03:14.729 --> 00:03:18.745

To run, basically. So you will

need to tick all this, this might



52

00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:22.079

put your computer at somewhere of a risk, but



53

00:03:22.397 --> 00:03:25.257

as I said, this is not

a recommended procedure at all.



54

00:03:26.712 --> 00:03:31.450

So go ahead and close this,

just fire up Mac Linux USB creator



55

00:03:31.485 --> 00:03:35.788

and here you have

Persistence Manager, Create Live USB.



56

00:03:35.823 --> 00:03:38.856

All you need really is an image and



57

00:03:38.891 --> 00:03:42.916

just use this tool to create it and then boot it.



58

00:03:42.951 --> 00:03:48.518

Should work without any problems

on 2013 and newer MacBook Pros.



59

00:03:52.134 --> 00:03:55.370

I didn't really intend to go

through the detailed steps here



60

00:03:55.405 --> 00:03:58.610

as it's, I mean, not that required.



61

00:03:58.645 --> 00:04:02.608

I will show you how to

format a USB and you will need



62

00:04:02.643 --> 00:04:06.120

to format a USB in a proper

manner regardless of whether you are



63

00:04:06.155 --> 00:04:11.140

on 2012 and older Macs or 2013 and newer Macs,



64

00:04:11.175 --> 00:04:13.174

it's completely irrelevant, you will still need



65

00:04:13.209 --> 00:04:16.141

to format the USB drive, so keep that in mind.



66

00:04:19.093 --> 00:04:20.891

And these down below



67

00:04:22.414 --> 00:04:25.179

so you have... I can set the USB up.



68

00:04:29.623 --> 00:04:31.809

There's really no need

to use that, I can just go and say



69

00:04:31.844 --> 00:04:37.834

Create a Live USB, double

click on it. Select the ISO file.



70

00:04:39.911 --> 00:04:43.390

Come on, load, load, load. Please.



71

00:04:43.425 --> 00:04:45.681

Downloads. Thank you.



72

00:04:45.716 --> 00:04:49.455

So you just select the ISO file

that you have downloaded from the net,



73

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:54.653

click on Open and you select

the device which you want here



74

00:04:54.688 --> 00:04:57.520

and you go Next and click on Begin installation.



75

00:04:57.555 --> 00:05:01.929

Once it's done reboot the Mac.

Actually don't reboot it, power it off



76

00:05:01.964 --> 00:05:07.511

and then power it back on and

select the additional option that you get.



77

00:05:09.012 --> 00:05:12.122

That should work really without

any problems, I have tested it out



78

00:05:12.157 --> 00:05:18.866

and it does work, but what I

have realized that does not work is the...



79

00:05:20.688 --> 00:05:26.368

is the procedure for

MacBook Pros that are older than 2012.



80

00:05:26.403 --> 00:05:30.936

2012 is a borderline year,

so on some it might work from 2012,



81

00:05:30.971 --> 00:05:32.636

on some it might not, I don't know.



82

00:05:32.671 --> 00:05:35.562

But anything older, this procedure will apply.



83

00:05:37.348 --> 00:05:39.580

The very first thing that you need to do is,



84

00:05:39.615 --> 00:05:44.021

as said, consider the year

of your MacBook Pro, mine is 2011.



85

00:05:44.056 --> 00:05:49.194

And then you need to have a functioning USB,



86

00:05:49.229 --> 00:05:53.384

make sure that it is functional and

not defective or anything like that.



87

00:05:55.474 --> 00:05:58.928

Recommended size should be...



88

00:05:58.963 --> 00:06:02.531

I have my 32 gigs, which is



89

00:06:02.566 --> 00:06:06.433

something that you can use,

something that I would recommend



90

00:06:07.783 --> 00:06:09.957

just to make sure

that you are not out of space at all.



91

00:06:11.890 --> 00:06:15.085

And I have another one,

which I'll use for this demonstration



92

00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:19.479

which is 64 gigs. It might take

you a while to format larger ones,



93

00:06:19.514 --> 00:06:23.950

but there really is no reason

or need to go over 32 gigs at all.



94

00:06:25.511 --> 00:06:31.087

In regards to the

persistence storage on 2011 and older



95

00:06:32.412 --> 00:06:34.674

somewhat tricky, I haven't managed to do that.



96

00:06:36.839 --> 00:06:40.149

I have asked so many friends

and read through so many forums,



97

00:06:40.184 --> 00:06:44.332

I went to hell and farther,

and then I walked some more,



98

00:06:45.924 --> 00:06:48.224

and I went to the Apple service as well,



99

00:06:48.259 --> 00:06:51.930

I was willing to pay them

to see what they can do about it,



100

00:06:51.965 --> 00:06:53.445

and they actually did try to do it,



101

00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.682

but they also have failed miserably,



102

00:06:55.717 --> 00:06:58.359

so they didn't charge

me anything for it, which is nice.



103

00:06:59.865 --> 00:07:02.657

Then I went to some other acquaintances



104

00:07:04.417 --> 00:07:08.620

and we finally managed to get

some sort of a hybrid state working,



105

00:07:08.655 --> 00:07:13.155

where you have one bootable

partition, which is non-persistent,



106

00:07:13.190 --> 00:07:17.304

and you have another

partition, which is xte4 format



107

00:07:17.982 --> 00:07:22.696

and then you can save whatever

you want there, whatever files you want



108

00:07:22.731 --> 00:07:27.387

which is very nice if you want

to download files and storage them,



109

00:07:27.422 --> 00:07:29.792

but also is very nice if you

want to keep your configuration.



110

00:07:29.827 --> 00:07:33.742

So what you can do is

make small configuration scripts



111

00:07:33.777 --> 00:07:37.579

or one big configuration script that you just run



112

00:07:37.614 --> 00:07:40.421

once everytime you boot the machine up,



113

00:07:40.456 --> 00:07:44.838

so it configures the live

image the way you want it to be.



114

00:07:48.473 --> 00:07:49.797

I don't think it's a huge hindrance.



115

00:07:49.832 --> 00:07:52.336

Basically, once you make the

script you just add the commands to it



116

00:07:52.371 --> 00:07:57.796

and you just need to click it

once or run it once in order to



117

00:07:57.831 --> 00:08:00.344

basically have your set-up configured



118

00:08:00.379 --> 00:08:04.154

the way you want it to

be configured. On newer Macs



119

00:08:04.189 --> 00:08:09.380

I'm pretty sure it shouldn't

be a problem of any kind or sort.



120

00:08:10.746 --> 00:08:15.126

Let's go ahead and proceed with

this tutorial and see how this works out



121

00:08:15.161 --> 00:08:18.505

and see what we can actually do and accomplish.



122

00:08:18.540 --> 00:08:20.401

Be warned, it can mess your Mac up



123

00:08:20.436 --> 00:08:23.208

to the point where you need to reinstall it.



124

00:08:23.243 --> 00:08:26.534

Keep that in mind before you

decide to go through this procedure.



125

00:08:26.569 --> 00:08:28.486

Think twice. I'm serious.



126

00:08:29.903 --> 00:08:36.517

Anyway, go out onto the net,

open up your browser and find this site,



127

00:08:36.552 --> 00:08:41.041

it's unetbootin.github.io.



128

00:08:42.687 --> 00:08:44.947

Here, let's just type it in.



129

00:08:54.890 --> 00:08:57.712

Just do it from the search and

there you go, the first one that pops out.



130

00:08:58.575 --> 00:09:02.767

Make sure it's https.

It says unetbootin.github.io.



131

00:09:02.802 --> 00:09:06.431

Open it up, click on Downloads for Mac OS X,



132

00:09:06.466 --> 00:09:08.879

I already downloaded it,

it's in my Downloads folder,



133

00:09:08.914 --> 00:09:11.267

so once you click on it,

it's gonna go into your Downloads folder



134

00:09:12.571 --> 00:09:16.028

and hopefully you went into Settings and allowed



135

00:09:20.333 --> 00:09:22.552

the applications to install and run from anywhere.



136

00:09:22.587 --> 00:09:25.419

As I said, that puts your

computer to somewhere at risk



137

00:09:25.804 --> 00:09:28.094

but that is a necessary step.



138

00:09:28.129 --> 00:09:31.863

Keep in mind, I have stated

before and I am restating it,



139

00:09:31.898 --> 00:09:32.991

it is not a recommended configuration.



140

00:09:35.189 --> 00:09:39.426

Now that that is done,

go over to your Downloads folder



141

00:09:39.461 --> 00:09:41.998

and find unetbootin, there you go.



142

00:09:42.033 --> 00:09:45.662

It's right there,

that is the tool that we shall need.



143

00:09:45.697 --> 00:09:47.799

That is the only thing

that you need to download from



144

00:09:47.834 --> 00:09:49.537

the net, from the sites.



145

00:09:53.462 --> 00:09:55.299

The rest of the files I'll provide on Udemy



146

00:09:55.334 --> 00:09:58.774

from where you can actually

download them and use them.



147

00:10:00.582 --> 00:10:05.076

Let's go ahead and leave

that there for the time being



148

00:10:05.111 --> 00:10:07.266

and go into our Disk Utility.



149

00:10:15.778 --> 00:10:17.094

Have you noticed that things on Mac



150

00:10:17.129 --> 00:10:19.467

just don't tend to close

the way you want them to close?



151

00:10:22.064 --> 00:10:25.159

They just get minimized, but OK, no big deal.



152

00:10:25.194 --> 00:10:27.837

So Command+Espace and search for



153

00:10:33.571 --> 00:10:36.561

Disk Utility, press Enter.



154

00:10:36.596 --> 00:10:44.224

Open it up. At the moment I have

two USBs plugged in and I'm not gonna



155

00:10:44.259 --> 00:10:49.005

wait for the burning to

complete because that will take forever,



156

00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.044

took me forever anyway, but I will

show you what to do and how to do it.



157

00:11:12.881 --> 00:11:15.388

There we go, so both of them are hooked up,



158

00:11:15.423 --> 00:11:20.409

I'm using a USB hub on the

other end to plug multiple things in



159

00:11:20.444 --> 00:11:25.473

because Macs suffer

apparently from a chronic lack of ports,



160

00:11:25.508 --> 00:11:27.574

which is annoying beyond belief.



161

00:11:28.839 --> 00:11:30.423

But OK, no problems.



162

00:11:31.869 --> 00:11:37.246

Over here is the USB port

which we shall be playing



163

00:11:37.281 --> 00:11:41.470

and down below is another USB which I will use



164

00:11:41.505 --> 00:11:45.024

to show you where the files

are, actually I can use both of them.



165

00:11:45.059 --> 00:11:51.990

So what you need to do is,

first, go ahead and hit the Toshiba



166

00:11:55.414 --> 00:11:59.604

and state that you want to

erase it, so we're gonna go over to Erase



167

00:11:59.639 --> 00:12:03.322

and it says MS-DOS (FAT), name Untitled.



168

00:12:03.357 --> 00:12:06.490

You can change the name, let's call it Kali.



169

00:12:10.322 --> 00:12:11.817

You can call it whatever you want, feel free.



170

00:12:11.852 --> 00:12:15.337

Let you imagination go.



171

00:12:15.372 --> 00:12:18.409

And we're gonna go ahead and state Erase.



172

00:12:18.444 --> 00:12:23.368

It's warning me that I have

two partitions which will get erased.



173

00:12:23.403 --> 00:12:27.421

I'm fine with that. Can't unmount the disk,



174

00:12:27.456 --> 00:12:29.186

why can't you unmount the disk?



175

00:12:42.675 --> 00:12:44.891

What is using it?



176

00:12:44.926 --> 00:12:47.086

OK, so this might happen to you as well,



177

00:12:47.121 --> 00:12:48.679

so I'm just leaving it in the tutorial.



178

00:12:48.714 --> 00:12:52.166

The disk "UNTITLED" couldn't be

erased because "Terminal" is using it.



179

00:12:56.123 --> 00:12:57.834

How is the terminal using it, I wonder.



180

00:12:57.869 --> 00:12:59.796

Maybe I was in the folder or something.



181

00:13:01.878 --> 00:13:05.696

Because the Terminal

is using it. I am not using it!



182

00:13:05.731 --> 00:13:08.002

Oh, right, wait, wait.



183

00:13:14.328 --> 00:13:17.056

So I might be making a

complete fool of myself here



184

00:13:21.539 --> 00:13:24.702

but I'm just gonna go ahead

and try to do it one more time here



185

00:13:24.737 --> 00:13:29.260

and then I'm gonna go into,

basically, forcefully, ripping it out.



186

00:13:32.780 --> 00:13:35.854

Force Quit.



187

00:13:38.996 --> 00:13:41.451

Yes, please, leave.



188

00:13:42.910 --> 00:13:48.834

There we go, so it is out and

now we no longer have it here



189

00:13:48.869 --> 00:13:51.328

which is not something we want,



190

00:13:51.363 --> 00:13:54.839

so we're just gonna take

it out and then plug it back in



191

00:13:56.339 --> 00:13:58.498

and see, will that help out?



192

00:14:01.527 --> 00:14:05.846

Okay, Toshiba, so let's go

ahead and click on it, go into Erase,



193

00:14:05.881 --> 00:14:11.606

Erase, Erase. And unmounting, come on.



194

00:14:11.641 --> 00:14:13.686

Please, be successful.



195

00:14:16.592 --> 00:14:19.590

OK, it's formatting the disk.



196

00:14:19.625 --> 00:14:24.207

Eventually it should

finish. There we go, it is done.



197

00:14:26.199 --> 00:14:30.866

We have erased it once, and

now we're gonna go into Partitions.



198

00:14:30.901 --> 00:14:35.737

Let's go choose 2 partitions

and we're gonna label the first one.



199

00:14:37.162 --> 00:14:40.957

I'm gonna give the first one like 9 gigs,



200

00:14:40.992 --> 00:14:44.089

even though that's not gonna be usable probably,



201

00:14:44.124 --> 00:14:47.137

but doesn't really matter. And the second one



202

00:14:47.172 --> 00:14:51.491

is whatever remains,

doesn't really matter. At all.



203

00:14:51.526 --> 00:14:52.912

So whatever the second one is,



204

00:14:52.947 --> 00:14:55.259

that's what the second

one is, whatever space remains.



205

00:14:55.294 --> 00:15:00.449

I'm gonna go ahead and click on Apply.



206

00:15:00.484 --> 00:15:08.854

OK, so just state

Partition and let it go, let it finish.



207

00:15:08.889 --> 00:15:16.327

This part shouldn't take long.

The other part can hang for quite a while



208

00:15:16.362 --> 00:15:19.811

and it can be annoying. Pretty annoying.



209

00:15:19.846 --> 00:15:23.615

Now the next thing that we need to do is actually



210

00:15:23.650 --> 00:15:27.357

mess around with the second partition,



211

00:15:28.618 --> 00:15:31.157

but we are going to do that later on.



212

00:15:31.192 --> 00:15:33.837

For the time being, we're just

gonna deal with the first partition



213

00:15:33.872 --> 00:15:37.103

and we're gonna attempt to create



214

00:15:37.138 --> 00:15:40.426

a bootable USB on the

first partition of the drive.



215

00:15:40.461 --> 00:15:44.744

So we no longer need

this. Now, I would like you to go



216

00:15:44.779 --> 00:15:48.626

back into Downloads,

where our unetbootin is stored.



217

00:15:54.043 --> 00:15:58.387

There we go, so just start it.

It's gonna request for your permission.



218

00:16:00.826 --> 00:16:02.402

Give it.



219

00:16:04.243 --> 00:16:05.777

If you want, that is.



220

00:16:09.322 --> 00:16:11.739

I don't really care about

my passwords here anyway,



221

00:16:11.774 --> 00:16:15.626

they're just nonsense. I will reformat



222

00:16:15.661 --> 00:16:20.670

this whole drive, this whole computer



223

00:16:20.705 --> 00:16:23.618

because I've done so much

stuff to it just to get this to work,



224

00:16:23.653 --> 00:16:26.581

it would take way too long to fix it manually.



225

00:16:30.201 --> 00:16:32.790

Okay, don't need VirtualBox at the moment.



226

00:16:33.814 --> 00:16:37.110

Is unetbootin fired up?

Please, tell me that it is. Right here.



227

00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.037

So we have unetbootin here and we're gonna say



228

00:16:42.072 --> 00:16:45.797

"Diskimage", ISO, select a disk image



229

00:16:47.428 --> 00:16:53.067

I'm assuming that you have

downloaded Kali from the net, here it is.



230

00:16:53.102 --> 00:16:57.359

If you haven't, I mean

I always show this, I don't think less of you



231

00:16:57.394 --> 00:16:59.290

but I always like to show it just in case,



232

00:16:59.325 --> 00:17:02.695

because always somebody will

ask like they skipped a tutorial or two



233

00:17:02.730 --> 00:17:05.128

"where can I download it?" even if I have showed it



234

00:17:05.163 --> 00:17:08.314

in the previous tutorial. Just go to Kali Linux,



235

00:17:08.349 --> 00:17:14.537

press Enter and look, it's here, go to Downloads



236

00:17:14.572 --> 00:17:17.783

and there you go,

so you can download it from here.



237

00:17:17.818 --> 00:17:20.514

You can download the ISO

or if you have a torrent client,



238

00:17:20.549 --> 00:17:21.968

you can just go via torrent.



239

00:17:22.003 --> 00:17:25.537

Just click on it, on the ISO,

and that's it. If you have a torrent,



240

00:17:25.572 --> 00:17:28.312

you can go over to

torrents as well, a client, that is.



241

00:17:30.779 --> 00:17:35.415

OK, so let's go ahead and select the amd64.iso,



242

00:17:35.450 --> 00:17:40.081

say Open. It says USB Drive.



243

00:17:40.116 --> 00:17:45.847

Make sure to select the

right one. Don't take the wrong drive,



244

00:17:45.882 --> 00:17:49.654

this can be detrimental in the worst of senses.



245

00:17:49.689 --> 00:17:55.421

Pop up the terminal. Type in...

I'm just gonna go and clear the screen.



246

00:17:55.456 --> 00:18:04.717

Then I'm gonna do "diskutil list". So disk one is



247

00:18:04.752 --> 00:18:08.334

says Untitled 1, Untitled 2.



248

00:18:08.369 --> 00:18:12.335

Actually we could have

renamed them, but I don't really care.



249

00:18:12.370 --> 00:18:13.903

You can do so if you wish.



250

00:18:13.938 --> 00:18:22.050

This is the one that we need, so disk1 and disk1s1.



251

00:18:22.085 --> 00:18:27.233

That's the one that we really

want, so let's go ahead and select that.



252

00:18:27.268 --> 00:18:35.035

Disk1s1, that is perfectly

fine. Let's go ahead and say OK.



253

00:18:35.070 --> 00:18:38.998

And this is gonna

take for... well, maybe not forever,



254

00:18:39.033 --> 00:18:41.291

but don't worry if it hangs in a single file.



255

00:18:43.058 --> 00:18:45.481

You see, this is 78MB, so this is gonna be longer



256

00:18:45.516 --> 00:18:47.917

and then you're gonna

have another one, which is 200MB



257

00:18:47.952 --> 00:18:52.001

and that's gonna take

even longer, so just let it run, let it run.



258

00:18:52.201 --> 00:18:57.419

Just let it run. You see,

this is 2832MB. Just let it run.



259

00:18:57.454 --> 00:18:59.398

It's gonna be a while before it finishes.



260

00:18:59.433 --> 00:19:02.799

I don't know, go have

a walk, cup of coffee, whatever.



261

00:19:02.834 --> 00:19:06.682

If you wanted to rename

your Kali, you can go ahead and do this:



262

00:19:09.891 --> 00:19:11.653

so Disk Utility.



263

00:19:16.001 --> 00:19:19.104

Come on. Please, I'm running out of time.



264

00:19:22.762 --> 00:19:26.069

So during the formatting time, you can click on



265

00:19:28.179 --> 00:19:30.460

Erase and then it's gonna...



266

00:19:30.495 --> 00:19:33.167

then you can change the name here if you want.



267

00:19:33.202 --> 00:19:35.589

If you don't want it,

you can leave it with Untitled.



268

00:19:35.624 --> 00:19:41.139

Whatever you want. Anyway,

I'm gonna call this tutorial here



269

00:19:41.174 --> 00:19:44.153

and we're gonna come back when this is done.
