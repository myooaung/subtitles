00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,200
Today I will start a chapter on footprinting.

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,000
So I have explained what the act of footprinting is before

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:16,400
but now we will actually go ahead and conduct a few scans to see how it all works

5
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:20,300
and introduce you to the tools that we will be using.

6
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:23,500
So first off, we need to find ourselves a target to scan.

7
00:00:23,500 --> 00:00:27,000
Of course I could just scan myself or something of a kind

8
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,800
but that would not be a realistic thing really

9
00:00:29,800 --> 00:00:35,400
because I already know what the results are going to be, plus on top of that

10
00:00:35,400 --> 00:00:39,250
I'm not scanning long range over the Internet or something of a kind.

11
00:00:39,250 --> 00:00:41,500
I would be scanning within my own local network

12
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:44,400
so the speeds of the scan would not be realistic

13
00:00:44,400 --> 00:00:50,400
as it would be a lot faster then, say, when you conduct a scan over the net

14
00:00:50,400 --> 00:00:53,300
some distant and remote server.

15
00:00:53,300 --> 00:00:57,000
So what I did was I went online, and you can do the same

16
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,200
and I found on the official Nmap website

17
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:08,000
they have a section devoted to actually allowing people to scan them to test their tool out.

18
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,000
Now here I am selecting the permission.

19
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,200
There is a written permission here that you can actually scan this website

20
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,200
and they basically say you can scan it to test it out.

21
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,700
A few scans a day here  is fine, but do not scan a hundred times a day

22
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:31,800
or use this to test your ssh brute-force password cracking tool, etc.

23
00:01:31,800 --> 00:01:34,000
So that's definitely something you don't want to do

24
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:37,700
but you can run a few scans on this site per day

25
00:01:37,700 --> 00:01:41,000
and according to them, that's perfectly fine.

26
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,850
You're not breaking any laws or anything of a kind

27
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:50,000
and I am just emphasizing one more time that you do have a written permission right here on the site

28
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:56,000
which is fantastic, because it gives us an opportunity to actually simulate real time circumstances

29
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,600
and see how Nmap behaves.

30
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:06,200
Now Nmap is an unescapable tool of pretty much any pen tester out there.

31
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,700
Many people say today that it's pointless to port scan

32
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,700
it doesn't do you much good, and so on and so forth.

33
00:02:13,700 --> 00:02:19,000
Well, perhaps in terms of exploiting the services running on the port themselves

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:20,700
it doesn't do you much good

35
00:02:20,700 --> 00:02:24,900
but just by seeing which ports are open and which ports are closed

36
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:26,400
you can, to a fairly good extent

37
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,400
determine what operating system or what platform is being used on the other side

38
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:35,700
and then you can find weaknesses of that same platform.

39
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:37,920
Of course, there are some other ways of doing this.

40
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,600
I will show them to you, like banner grabbing or something of a kind

41
00:02:41,600 --> 00:02:45,500
but let's just see how Nmap really works.

42
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,590
Now Nmap is known to basically trigger quite a lot of alarms

43
00:02:51,590 --> 00:02:56,300
quite a lot of firewall red flags, so to say

44
00:02:56,300 --> 00:03:01,200
and you want to make sure that your Nmap scans are as quiet as possible.

45
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:05,500
Now there are tools to actually figured this out

46
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:10,300
but I will show you here how to actually do it by a terminal.

47
00:03:10,300 --> 00:03:13,000
There's also something called zenmap.

48
00:03:13,000 --> 00:03:18,500
Now zenmap is basically a graphical user interface of nmap, but we will not be using that.

49
00:03:18,500 --> 00:03:22,200
Rather instead, I want to teach you how to use a terminal version

50
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,200
So nmap is the one most commonly used

51
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,500
and it is always used in the terminal text format.

52
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:33,000
Rarely anybody uses the actual graphical user interface.

53
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,000
In the previous chapter, we have also discussed how to stay anonymous.

54
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:41,000
So at the end of this chapter, I will be combining these things --

55
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:48,300
The act of scanning and anonymizing your scans.

56
00:03:48,300 --> 00:03:53,200
However, you might think about that before you get to the final tutorial of this chapter

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,600
and perhaps try to do it yourselves.

58
00:03:55,600 --> 00:03:59,200
It doesn't matter if you fail or something or kind, it truly doesn't.

59
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,800
What is important is that you give it a shot and you try it once.

60
00:04:03,800 --> 00:04:06,000
Okay, failure. Fine. No problems.

61
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:07,500
Try it twice, thrice

62
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:11,000
The fourth time you're bound to have some sort of results.

63
00:04:11,000 --> 00:04:13,800
As long as you keep improving yourselves, it's fine.

64
00:04:13,800 --> 00:04:21,500
In any case, without further ado, let's just type in "nmap - -help"

65
00:04:21,500 --> 00:04:25,000
Whoops, I mistyped that of course

66
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:28,500
"nmap - -help", press ENTER, and there we go.

67
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,500
There are a lot of options here.

68
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
I mean, a ton load of options.

69
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,800
Way more options than we actually need for some sort of basic things.

70
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,300
However, eventually over time

71
00:04:41,300 --> 00:04:45,700
you will come to understand that all of these options are not here for nothing.

72
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:51,000
They are here because they were needed at some point of time

73
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:53,770
and they are pretty much all still used.

74
00:04:53,770 --> 00:04:58,000
So what you need to do is scroll down to the bottom

75
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,300
and here you have examples of how nmap runs

76
00:05:02,300 --> 00:05:06,400
So you type in "nmap -v" almost always

77
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:08,600
99% of times

78
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,000
99% of time is verbose output.

79
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:19,000
Basically you're telling your system to give you more information in regards to what it is doing.

80
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:21,000
"-A" -- I am not sure what this function is...

81
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:28,000
Oh here is  -- "-A: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute"

82
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:30,500
I don't think we're going to need that immediately.

83
00:05:30,500 --> 00:05:35,000
There is -o function, which is just for OS detection.

84
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:41,640
Anyway. and then you can pass either this one -- scanme.nmap.org

85
00:05:41,640 --> 00:05:46,200
which is basically the domain name, which will get resolved to an IP address

86
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:48,600
or you can actually pass it an IP address

87
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:52,500
and if you're wondering what this is, this is a mask

88
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:56,600
and it would be very difficult to explain in great detail what this is

89
00:05:56,600 --> 00:06:02,200
but for the time being, know that this is actually an IP address range.

90
00:06:02,200 --> 00:06:06,300
So it goes from a certain IP address to a certain IP address

91
00:06:06,300 --> 00:06:11,700
because this goes way into networking and binary numbers, and so on and so forth

92
00:06:11,700 --> 00:06:13,800
but you do not actually need to use this format.

93
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,600
Not that many people actually use this particular format with the mask.

94
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,300
They just tend to specify very specific ranges

95
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,200
because they usually don't have the permissions to scan the entire subnet.

96
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:30,390
Rather instead, they have to create lists

97
00:06:30,390 --> 00:06:35,200
and then skip certain IP addresses, and then continue again from a certain point.

98
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:40,000
So they do need to create lists, and that can be a problem.

99
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:46,400
Now up here, at the top, you have another very important option that will come in handy.

100
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,200
You have "-iL <inputfilename>

101
00:06:51,200 --> 00:06:58,000
So you can actually create a list in a file, a list of IP addresses

102
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,000
and then you can scan those particular IP addresses.

103
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:05,200
You also have an ability to do this

104
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:07,300
Look at what's written here

105
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:10,700
So just take a look at this segment --It's 10.0

106
00:07:10,700 --> 00:07:17,700
and then this segment here, this octet -- It's 0.255

107
00:07:17,700 --> 00:07:22,200
and then the last octet is 1 - 254

108
00:07:22,200 --> 00:07:26,000
If you're wondering why I'm calling these things octets

109
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,600
it's because they have eight bits.

110
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:34,000
Each one of these has 8 bits and it is represented in a binary form.

111
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:41,300
So it can have eight zeros or, I don't know, eight ones or a combination of ones and zeros

112
00:07:41,300 --> 00:07:45,000
but it has eight bits...so eight positions.

113
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:47,900
That's why they're called octets.

114
00:07:47,900 --> 00:07:51,000
This is a very common form that people tend to use

115
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,500
and this is what you will find yourselves using.

116
00:07:54,500 --> 00:07:58,500
Either this -- This will be a method in which will specify the IP addresses

117
00:07:58,500 --> 00:08:02,200
or you will be passing files.

118
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:08,600
So these files, usually people either make them themselves

119
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,300
or they can find these IP addresses on the internet.

120
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,400
So in addition to this site -- nmap.org

121
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:30,000
you also have this one here...

122
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:34,000
This is a fantastic website.

123
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:39,000
The entire range of pretty much all the IP addresses are listed here

124
00:08:39,000 --> 00:08:41,900
and it also says who owns what

125
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:45,400
it doesn't say for every one of them who owns which one

126
00:08:45,400 --> 00:08:50,000
but for example, you can search and find

127
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:56,200
and it's gonna give you the appropriate IP addresses for that particular country

128
00:08:56,200 --> 00:08:58,900
and it's gonna give you the owner of those IP addresses.

129
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:04,400
Usually just telecoms, but you also have other people who own them as well.

130
00:09:04,400 --> 00:09:06,430
So let's just give it a shot

131
00:09:06,430 --> 00:09:17,000
Let's just type in Germany or, I don't know, France...

132
00:09:17,000 --> 00:09:21,600
Okay, this is not the proper search, but not a problem.

133
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,500
You can actually can find it down here

134
00:09:26,500 --> 00:09:32,500
or I could CTRL F France

135
00:09:32,500 --> 00:09:34,800
and there we go.

136
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,200
So you have a range -- This is a given range here

137
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:46,600
It's from 2.0.0.0 to 2.15.255.255

138
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:51,100
This is a massive range. This is a humongous range.

139
00:09:51,100 --> 00:09:54,600
This is how many IP addresses you can have in total.

140
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:57,200
How many of them you can generate within this range.

141
00:09:57,200 --> 00:09:58,800
It's quite a lot

142
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,000
It's French telecom

143
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:05,000
For some reason they need it, so you can sort them out by the owner

144
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:10,050
and you can see that a lot of them are actually not listed here.

145
00:10:10,050 --> 00:10:13,400
France has a lot of IP addresses assigned to it.

146
00:10:13,400 --> 00:10:15,300
They're not free, they cost money.

147
00:10:15,300 --> 00:10:22,100
Let's just go ahead and see down below...
Where is it? Where is it?

148
00:10:22,100 --> 00:10:25,200
Okay, so you see all of these IP addresses

149
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,800
and this is a pretty massive range...

150
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:34,000
So this is a telecom in France.

151
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,000
Look at how many IP addresses ranges they have.

152
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,300
That's quite a lot

153
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:45,200
and this site, as I said previously, you can use to figure out which IP address range do you wish scan

154
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:48,500
but you usually do not have the permission to scan the entire range.

155
00:10:48,500 --> 00:10:52,800
You can scan certain IP addresses within that range for which you have a permission

156
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,200
but also very nice site to determine where the IP address is from or something like that.

157
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,200
However, always remember --

158
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,000
Once you get an IP address, your search engines on the net are your best friends.

159
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:11,300
This is one of the major components of footprinting.

160
00:11:11,300 --> 00:11:12,900
You can do the following --

161
00:11:12,900 --> 00:11:18,000
You can type in "who is" and then type an IP address.

162
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:22,200
I'm just gonna type in this random IP address.

163
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:27,000
So if you don't want to see it here, you can have a look at it here.

164
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:35,500
Somebody is going to tell me who this guy is

165
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:36,700
There we go

166
00:11:36,700 --> 00:11:41,600
So I've typed in "who is" and I've picked the first website out that I could find

167
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:46,500
and here I have all the information in regards to that particular IP address.

168
00:11:46,500 --> 00:11:53,000
I have a country, I have the username of the admin I suppose

169
00:11:53,000 --> 00:11:57,000
I have its status, remarks, source

170
00:11:57,000 --> 00:12:07,000
There's actually an address, a physical address of the IP, which is ridiculous.

171
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:15,400
So as I said, search engines are your best, absolutely best, friends.

172
00:12:15,400 --> 00:12:20,400
If you want to find pretty much anything on the net or something like that

173
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:25,800
in regards to an IP address, to do any sort of research.

174
00:12:25,800 --> 00:12:30,000
Those are the two tools that I have showed you, actually three of them

175
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:35,960
well, one tool, one website, and one search method

176
00:12:35,960 --> 00:12:41,500
which you can use in order to determine where the IP address is from or who is using it

177
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:46,900
and even to determine its physical location, although its physical location can be assigned to a telecom

178
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:53,700
and that telecom can assign it to a city, to a specific region in the city, or something of a kind

179
00:12:53,700 --> 00:12:58,400
and then you can find it on Google Earth or something of a kind

180
00:12:58,400 --> 00:13:00,700
but usually those things are not that precise.

181
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:05,500
What is precise, however, is that the IP address belongs to telecom or something or kind

182
00:13:05,500 --> 00:13:08,300
and they keep rotating them in between the cities

183
00:13:08,300 --> 00:13:14,300
So if you have like a hundred thousand IP addresses that you scan, and you wish to sort them out by the city

184
00:13:14,300 --> 00:13:22,000
you will like 70% to 90% accuracy, depending for which country did you do it.

185
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:24,800
This can be problematic because you're gonna miss out on some things

186
00:13:24,800 --> 00:13:26,540
but you don't need 100% accuracy.

187
00:13:26,540 --> 00:13:28,700
You can get your sorting done pretty well.

188
00:13:28,700 --> 00:13:30,900
There are databases which you can update.

189
00:13:30,900 --> 00:13:32,400
I will show you these things.

190
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:35,000
They are called goip lookups

191
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:42,500
but before we do that, you also have something called "nslookup"

192
00:13:42,500 --> 00:13:49,000
and I'm just going to use this generic name here -- scanme,nmap.org

193
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:52,500
paste it, and here we go

194
00:13:52,500 --> 00:14:01,200
I have basically said I want to look up files on scanme.nmap.org

195
00:14:01,200 --> 00:14:05,600
and okay, this is my DNS server, which is basically my router.

196
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:07,200
You see it says port 53

197
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:15,500
You know immediately that it's DNS because all the units traffic runs on port 53

198
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:18,240
and then we have the results.

199
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,200
So this is the domain name, and you get the IP address down below.

200
00:14:22,200 --> 00:14:26,900
So this is also one of the ways in which you can get the IP address of a site within a domain

201
00:14:26,900 --> 00:14:28,700
because once you know the domain

202
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:32,400
you don't actually know the IP address until you look it up or something like that

203
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,800
but there is a far simpler method.

204
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:36,200
You don't need to use nslookup.

205
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:38,600
Oh, by the way, nslookup also works in reverse.

206
00:14:38,600 --> 00:14:45,500
Just type in "nslookup", and you can type in the IP address.

207
00:14:45,500 --> 00:14:49,440
So let's just go ahead and press Enter

208
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:57,000
Okay, so this has run through a process of some sort down below.

209
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,300
These are authoritative answers from the name server.

210
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:04,000
Basically what that means they're DNS servers

211
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:08,000
and they're giving you responses and telling you who the domain belongs to

212
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:09,000
and so on and so forth

213
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:15,500
Ignore this part, and for the time being we can also ignore this part

214
00:15:15,500 --> 00:15:20,800
until we get into spoofing the DNS and changing it

215
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:22,000
and so on and so forth.

216
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,200
What I want to show you here is that you can actually get a domain name by typing in nslookup

217
00:15:27,200 --> 00:15:28,800
and then the IP address

218
00:15:28,800 --> 00:15:32,380
and here, where it says "Non-authoritative answer"

219
00:15:32,380 --> 00:15:38,000
you get the IP address and then you get the name, which the domain name.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,200
However, you might notice that there was a problem here --

221
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:46,000
That this IP address does not match this one.

222
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:48,400
Well guess what? It actually does.

223
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,800
Try looking it in reverse.

224
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:55,130
So it's 74, 74 here

225
00:15:55,130 --> 00:16:02,200
207, 207 here, 244, 244 here, 221 here, and 221 here.

226
00:16:02,200 --> 00:16:08,000
So when you do an nslookup and when you pass in an IP address

227
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:13,500
it's gonna do a reverse lookup in the DNS MX records or something of a kid.

228
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:18,700
It's gonna query the DNS servers and the DNS servers are going to give it a response

229
00:16:18,700 --> 00:16:22,400
but in the MX records, this is basically how things are written.

230
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,800
You write an IP address in reverse and then you put this in "in-addr.arpa"

231
00:16:28,800 --> 00:16:32,200
but this part really is not that interesting to us.

232
00:16:32,200 --> 00:16:38,100
This is more interesting to server admins who configure the DNS servers or something of a kind.

233
00:16:38,100 --> 00:16:39,600
In any case, for the time being

234
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:44,600
but don't worry, we will get to DNS servers in the later stages of this tutorial

235
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,000
once we are done with these things.

236
00:16:47,000 --> 00:16:51,300
In any case, what is important for you here is you've typed in an IP address

237
00:16:51,300 --> 00:16:58,000
you've use tool called nslookup and you have gotten a domain name in return

238
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:01,500
and now you can start doing some other things as well

239
00:17:01,500 --> 00:17:05,780
but we will be dealing primarily with nmap.

240
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:11,530
Nmap as a tool in order to scan networks and retrieve information from them

241
00:17:11,530 --> 00:17:14,800
but this what I've showed you now is some basic information retrieval

242
00:17:14,800 --> 00:17:18,470
and some basic external sources that you can use.

243
00:17:18,470 --> 00:17:25,200
In any case, I'll see you in part two of nmap introduction

244
00:17:25,200 --> 00:17:29,200
and there, we're going to actually conduct some scans and see how it all works.

245
00:17:29,200 --> 00:17:34,000
Thank you for watching and I hope to see you next time.
