00:00:00.090 --> 00:00:06.840

Thank you very much for getting started with the complete ethical hacking course with me Gerri Banfield



2

00:00:07.050 --> 00:00:13.230

and with Erman Kirkpatrick who does most of the lectures in the course we're honored you have chosen



3

00:00:13.230 --> 00:00:19.080

to take this journey with us to learn about ethical hacking and penetration testing.



4

00:00:19.410 --> 00:00:26.850

I think the most you can get out of this course is a motivation to learn and try out these things yourself.



5

00:00:26.850 --> 00:00:33.750

What you see in this course are valuable skills that people need worldwide and are willing to pay for



6

00:00:33.750 --> 00:00:35.030

your help.



7

00:00:35.430 --> 00:00:42.480

We hope that we've given you the opportunity in over 25 hours of HD video to learn these skills effectively



8

00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:48.420

in this course and we hope that you enjoy the community of students that we've all built here together



9

00:00:48.420 --> 00:00:55.550

over 30000 people just like you are taking this course and are hoping to learn from it.



10

00:00:55.770 --> 00:01:01.620

If you connect with other students in this course you can find amazing opportunities other people to



11

00:01:01.620 --> 00:01:07.410

work with to learn with and maybe even to work on line with or build a career together or make a new



12

00:01:07.410 --> 00:01:08.470

friend.



13

00:01:08.520 --> 00:01:15.270

All that gets started if you click on added discussion and if you are introduce yourself tell us what



14

00:01:15.270 --> 00:01:21.510

you're looking to learn out of the course even if you don't find even one video helpful just introducing



15

00:01:21.510 --> 00:01:27.750

yourself can give you the chance to start meeting and connecting with people in the course and you never



16

00:01:27.750 --> 00:01:29.650

know what can come out of it.



17

00:01:29.700 --> 00:01:35.500

Thank you very much for getting started and we hope that you loved this course.
