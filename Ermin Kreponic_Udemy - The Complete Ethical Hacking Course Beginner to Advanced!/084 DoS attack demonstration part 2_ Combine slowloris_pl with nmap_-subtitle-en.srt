1
00:00:00,820 --> 00:00:05,166
Okay, so welcome to yet
another tutorial on DOS attacks, and

2
00:00:05,166 --> 00:00:08,519
this time we're gonna
be combining two tools.

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:11,702
We're gonna use SlowLoris.pl.

4
00:00:11,702 --> 00:00:18,419
It's basically a pro script, and we're
gonna be using Nmap to actually conduct

5
00:00:18,419 --> 00:00:24,561
a scan of a website in order to determine
whether it's vulnerable or not.

6
00:00:24,561 --> 00:00:29,949
Now, this attack is not
perfect by any means.

7
00:00:29,949 --> 00:00:33,810
The more bandwidth you have, the better.

8
00:00:33,810 --> 00:00:36,016
The stronger computer you have,
also the better,

9
00:00:36,016 --> 00:00:38,030
because you'll be able
to make more threads.

10
00:00:40,420 --> 00:00:42,960
Threads means just more
simultaneous tasks.

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,135
However, sometimes,
most of the time actually,

12
00:00:47,135 --> 00:00:51,795
if you don't have enough bandwidth,
the site will not be

13
00:00:51,795 --> 00:00:56,845
permanently DOSed, so
users will still be able to access it,

14
00:00:56,845 --> 00:01:02,988
however their loading time will be like
yeah pretty long, a minute or two.

15
00:01:02,988 --> 00:01:06,266
Try putting yourselves in such a position,

16
00:01:06,266 --> 00:01:10,962
try thinking about a commercial
site where they sell things and

17
00:01:10,962 --> 00:01:15,922
imagine if all the clients logging
into that server have to wait for

18
00:01:15,922 --> 00:01:19,930
a couple of minutes before
that site actually loads.

19
00:01:19,930 --> 00:01:24,792
How many of you would actually stick
around and wouldn't just go to pretty much

20
00:01:24,792 --> 00:01:28,486
a very similar site,
it sells pretty much the same things.

21
00:01:28,486 --> 00:01:33,509
That's just a fictive scenario and
just trying to prove a point

22
00:01:33,509 --> 00:01:38,841
that you don't need to actually
permanently bring the site down.

23
00:01:38,841 --> 00:01:45,091
You can just render it unusable in
this fashion where users' access time

24
00:01:45,091 --> 00:01:50,490
is extremely long and
basically that site becomes unusable.

25
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,970
So whatever you're loading
it takes a minute or two and

26
00:01:52,970 --> 00:01:58,120
it feels like you're, I don't know
if everybody's going to remember

27
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:04,380
those ISDN connections or something of a
kind where everything was extremely slow.

28
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:07,420
Well that's basically how
that website would look like,

29
00:02:07,420 --> 00:02:10,410
when you are performing
this sort of attack.

30
00:02:11,490 --> 00:02:16,686
Anyway, there are a few things
which we need to do here.

31
00:02:16,686 --> 00:02:21,647
And one of those things is that
we need to conduct a scan, so

32
00:02:21,647 --> 00:02:25,615
lets go and
use our Nmap as we have used before.

33
00:02:25,615 --> 00:02:28,253
You see I have the commands
memorized here as I

34
00:02:28,253 --> 00:02:32,292
have used these things before to test
them out to see how it works out.

35
00:02:32,292 --> 00:02:34,074
So, I have nmap.

36
00:02:34,074 --> 00:02:41,290
I'm telling Nmap to use a particular
script for this purpose parallels 400.

37
00:02:41,290 --> 00:02:43,790
And I am giving it an IP
address that I wish to scan for

38
00:02:43,790 --> 00:02:46,340
this particular vulnerability.

39
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:50,470
I've also issued the double
verbose output in order for

40
00:02:50,470 --> 00:02:54,950
Nmap to actually tell me what is going on,
what it is doing.

41
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:05,094
On Nmap website,
let me just go ahead and do this.

42
00:03:05,094 --> 00:03:09,882
Excellent, so this is the site
where you can find all the scripts.

43
00:03:09,882 --> 00:03:15,180
I have shown you this before in the
previous tutorials that have label endmap

44
00:03:15,180 --> 00:03:20,230
or something of a kind where we've
dwelt on the chapter Footprinting and

45
00:03:20,230 --> 00:03:24,730
seen how we can actually scan
the servers for vulnerabilities.

46
00:03:24,730 --> 00:03:29,808
Remember how I told you that you can
find the scripts here on their website?

47
00:03:29,808 --> 00:03:33,600
Well, you can also find categories and
what every script does.

48
00:03:33,600 --> 00:03:35,268
I've also mentioned that as well.

49
00:03:35,268 --> 00:03:37,610
What we want is to click on DOS,
so denial of service.

50
00:03:37,610 --> 00:03:43,090
These particular scripts will scan for
those particular vulnerabilities.

51
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:47,885
They will scan for
vulnerabilities related to DOS attacks.

52
00:03:50,977 --> 00:03:55,971
And we have, I dunno, broadcast of avahi
DOS to discover hosts and local networks.

53
00:03:55,971 --> 00:04:00,960
So we're not really that interested
in local networks at the moment.

54
00:04:00,960 --> 00:04:03,235
I've dealt a lot with that on wireless and

55
00:04:03,235 --> 00:04:05,900
how you can actually
perform a DOS attack there.

56
00:04:05,900 --> 00:04:08,970
We want this one, http-slowloris.

57
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:15,780
Web server for vulnerability to the slow
loris dos attack by launching that

58
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:17,780
particular type of an attack.

59
00:04:17,780 --> 00:04:19,890
There are also other ones.

60
00:04:19,890 --> 00:04:25,122
Feel free to actually try
them out on your own systems,

61
00:04:25,122 --> 00:04:28,419
and see how that works out for you,

62
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:34,244
what different types of attacks
will actually work for you.

63
00:04:34,244 --> 00:04:38,246
Anyway, we want this one for
web servers, and

64
00:04:38,246 --> 00:04:43,183
in order to be able to DOS a website or
something of a kind.

65
00:04:43,183 --> 00:04:48,130
So I'm just going to go ahead and
use it here you see script http-slowloris.

66
00:04:48,130 --> 00:04:53,956
Press enter, and
let the scan run its course.

67
00:04:53,956 --> 00:04:58,222
The scan can take quite
a bit of your time.

68
00:04:58,222 --> 00:05:00,579
Why I don't know.

69
00:05:00,579 --> 00:05:01,454
It's in LAN.

70
00:05:01,454 --> 00:05:04,673
It should be a bit faster,
but apparently it's not.

71
00:05:04,673 --> 00:05:07,849
Over internet it's bound
to be slower than this, so

72
00:05:07,849 --> 00:05:11,544
don't just think it doesn't work or
something of the kind.

73
00:05:11,544 --> 00:05:16,707
It does work, but if you're doing this
online it might take a while longer.

74
00:05:16,707 --> 00:05:20,442
In LAN, I really thought it was faster but

75
00:05:20,442 --> 00:05:25,261
apparently this is the speed
at which it progresses.

76
00:05:25,261 --> 00:05:32,150
Anyway, you have all the standard
stuff that you would usually have.

77
00:05:32,150 --> 00:05:36,499
And down below,
it says Completed SYN Stealth Scan.

78
00:05:38,040 --> 00:05:40,480
Excellent.
So that's just the normal stuff.

79
00:05:40,480 --> 00:05:43,740
Down below, you have NSE: Script scanning.

80
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:48,682
Only after it has conducted its regular
scan does it begin the NSE: Script scan,

81
00:05:48,682 --> 00:05:51,371
the script which we have
actually passed and

82
00:05:51,371 --> 00:05:54,930
the script which we want to
utilize in order to figure out,

83
00:05:54,930 --> 00:05:58,661
is the server actually vulnerable
to this type of an attack.

84
00:05:58,661 --> 00:06:02,616
You have a separate timer for
the NSE script and

85
00:06:02,616 --> 00:06:07,500
the separate percentage done for
NSE script as well.

86
00:06:07,500 --> 00:06:13,660
So it says here the current time and
this is the remaining time.

87
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,580
I'm sorry this is not the current time,

88
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:20,380
this estimated time to completion,
something of a kind.

89
00:06:20,380 --> 00:06:23,090
It doesn't matter,
you don't have to pay attention to this.

90
00:06:23,090 --> 00:06:24,456
This is the important part.

91
00:06:24,456 --> 00:06:27,866
It says two minutes and forty-one
seconds remaining, one minute and

92
00:06:27,866 --> 00:06:29,500
fifty-one seconds remaining.

93
00:06:29,500 --> 00:06:34,537
It's gonna keep on issuing
them until its task is done.

94
00:06:34,537 --> 00:06:40,648
Once that is done, we will know whether
the server is vulnerable or not.

95
00:06:40,648 --> 00:06:44,380
These routers, they tend to be vulnerable,
I mean, to a ton load of things.

96
00:06:44,380 --> 00:06:48,010
I had a bit of an awkward experience.

97
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:52,971
Just goes to show that you should never
really move away from your computer while

98
00:06:52,971 --> 00:06:53,856
it's unlocked.

99
00:06:53,856 --> 00:06:58,428
My friends, they took my IP address and,
because the home routers are not

100
00:06:58,428 --> 00:07:03,251
really that good in terms of protection,
so they were dossing me basically.

101
00:07:03,251 --> 00:07:06,559
Of course, I can avoid it quite easily
by just changing the IP address,

102
00:07:06,559 --> 00:07:09,900
turning the router on and
off pretty much will do the trick.

103
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:11,730
There are other ways.

104
00:07:11,730 --> 00:07:14,955
But I couldn't figure out for about five,

105
00:07:14,955 --> 00:07:17,230
ten minutes,
I couldn't figure out what was going on.

106
00:07:17,230 --> 00:07:20,915
I didn't figure it out anyway because one
of the first things that people do when

107
00:07:20,915 --> 00:07:24,500
something is wrong with their internet
connection, they reset the router.

108
00:07:24,500 --> 00:07:28,436
That's what I did and of course the IP
address changed so the DOS attack stopped.

109
00:07:28,436 --> 00:07:33,424
Only later on did they actually tell
me that they were messing around with

110
00:07:33,424 --> 00:07:34,579
me a little bit.

111
00:07:34,579 --> 00:07:35,134
Anyway.

112
00:07:37,543 --> 00:07:39,220
The scan has completed.

113
00:07:39,220 --> 00:07:40,920
It says probably vulnerable.

114
00:07:40,920 --> 00:07:44,709
So let's see what we can do.

115
00:07:44,709 --> 00:07:48,962
You can go ahead and clear the screen
here, unless you have a 100 clients, or

116
00:07:48,962 --> 00:07:51,565
more than one client here
that you have scanned,

117
00:07:51,565 --> 00:07:55,205
then you want to redirect this to
a file as I have showed previously.

118
00:07:55,205 --> 00:07:59,195
So, go ahead and clear the screen.

119
00:07:59,195 --> 00:08:01,981
[COUGH] In the follow-up tutorial.

120
00:08:01,981 --> 00:08:06,061
Sorry for the cough,
something just got into my throat.

121
00:08:06,061 --> 00:08:09,948
But in the follow up tutorial,
we will actually go ahead and

122
00:08:09,948 --> 00:08:11,815
download the PERL script and

123
00:08:11,815 --> 00:08:17,470
see how we can actually utilize it in
order to actually perform this attack.

124
00:08:17,470 --> 00:08:19,430
Until then I bid you farewell.
