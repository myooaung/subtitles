00:00:00.100 --> 00:00:03.500

Hello everybody and welcome to this

tutorial today.



2

00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:06.900

Today I will be talking about our working environment.



3

00:00:06.900 --> 00:00:09.230

I will show you how you can set it up.



4

00:00:09.230 --> 00:00:13.599

So first off, we will need to install VirtualBox



5

00:00:13.599 --> 00:00:20.459

Now it doesn't matter if you're running

Mac OS X, Linux or Windows



6

00:00:20.470 --> 00:00:24.000

you will still need to do this



7

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:25.430

for several reasons, really.



8

00:00:25.430 --> 00:00:27.400

First of all



9

00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:29.130

I mean , we're gonna be doing a lot of stuff



10

00:00:29.130 --> 00:00:33.300

and we're gonna be doing it as root.



11

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:37.800

So we are always facing the prospect

that we might break something



12

00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:39.190

that we might mess something up



13

00:00:39.190 --> 00:00:43.370

I will show you how you can set it up.



14

00:00:43.370 --> 00:00:45.800

because even if you do mess something up



15

00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:47.420

and even if you don't know how to fix it



16

00:00:47.420 --> 00:00:48.900

it doesn't really matter



17

00:00:48.900 --> 00:00:50.300

It is only a virtual machine



18

00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:55.100

You don't really have any data of

importance on it.



19

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:57.600

However if you mess something up on your main machine



20

00:00:57.600 --> 00:00:58.890

However if you mess something up on your main machine



21

00:00:58.890 --> 00:01:03.300

If you're forced to reinstall it or something of a kind



22

00:01:03.300 --> 00:01:06.000

then you need to back all your data up



23

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:09.470

you need to figure out where everything is, etc



24

00:01:09.470 --> 00:01:12.729

or you can try fixing the problem



25

00:01:12.729 --> 00:01:14.200

and depending on what that is



26

00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:16.820

it could consume a large amount of your time



27

00:01:16.820 --> 00:01:20.100

So, just take my advice for it



28

00:01:20.100 --> 00:01:22.500

and go ahead and install VirtualBox.



29

00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:23.800

It's not that complicated.



30

00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:24.600

It's pretty simple.



31

00:01:24.600 --> 00:01:28.000

I'll show you how to do it in a minute.



32

00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000

There's another reason why we're installing a virtual machine



33

00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.540

and that is safety.



34

00:01:33.540 --> 00:01:36.600

We're gonna be downloading a lot of stuff from the net



35

00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:41.759

and even though I will be using sites that I consider to be safe



36

00:01:41.759 --> 00:01:45.000

and that a lot of other people consider

to be safe



37

00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.130

it is always good to have that extra layer of protection.



38

00:01:49.130 --> 00:01:52.840

So even if something happens and your virtual machine



39

00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:56.549

even if it gets compromised or something of a kind, it's fine.



40

00:01:56.549 --> 00:01:57.800

It's a virtual machine



41

00:01:57.800 --> 00:01:58.700

No problems there.



42

00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.300

There's nothing of importance there.



43

00:02:00.300 --> 00:02:02.500

Your private information is not there.



44

00:02:02.500 --> 00:02:04.149

Your credit card is not there.



45

00:02:04.149 --> 00:02:09.500

There is literally nothing there aside from the tools that you are using



46

00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:10.950

that can be obtained from the internet.



47

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:13.700

Anyway



48

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:15.370

So, without further adieu



49

00:02:15.370 --> 00:02:20.000

let's just go ahead and see how VirtualBox is installed.



50

00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:22.080

Now there are two ways of doing this.



51

00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.100

One is preferable over the other.



52

00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:29.250

So the first method is a lot simpler.



53

00:02:29.250 --> 00:02:33.050

So you can just go ahead and open up your favorite browser.



54

00:02:33.050 --> 00:02:36.700

Mine is Firefox.



55

00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:38.200

Use your favorite search engine.



56

00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:45.000

Type in "VirtualBox"



57

00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:45.820

Press enter



58

00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.000

and there you go!



59

00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:48.000

Straight off the bat!



60

00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.300

You have official site - VirtualBox.



61

00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.200

Just gonna go ahead and open it.



62

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:56.400

In the left corner, it says "About", "Screenshots"



63

00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:59.100

There's a ton load of documentation here.



64

00:02:59.100 --> 00:03:02.500

For the time being, there really isn't any need to go over it.



65

00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:05.230

Rather instead, just click "downloads"



66

00:03:05.230 --> 00:03:07.100

Excellent



67

00:03:07.100 --> 00:03:11.700

So here you have a list of host machines.



68

00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:15.310

You have "VirtualBox for Windows hosts", for "OS X hosts"



69

00:03:15.310 --> 00:03:18.000

for "Linux hosts", "Solaris hosts"...



70

00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.100

Actually for Solaris, you can just use it from repositories immediately



71

00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:26.700

but for the time being, we cannot use the repositories.



72

00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.800

We need to configure them in Linux



73

00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:31.400

and repositories in Linux are places



74

00:03:31.400 --> 00:03:35.930

from where you pull your software for your Linux distro.



75

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:42.000

Anyway, we will need VirtualBox for Linux hosts.



76

00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.700

I have already downloaded it in order to save time in this tutorial



77

00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.640

but you just click on it, and then it

pops.



78

00:03:49.650 --> 00:03:51.100

So you have



79

00:03:51.100 --> 00:03:53.000

These guys are amazing



80

00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:55.360

They have this virtual machine manager setup



81

00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:58.500

for multiple Linux distributions.



82

00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:00.000

So you have Ubuntu



83

00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:00.959

You have Debian



84

00:04:00.959 --> 00:04:03.900

Not sure why they actually separated Ubuntu and Debian



85

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.400

but it doesn't really matter since Ubuntu is based on Debian.



86

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:11.200

Pretty much everything that works in Debian will work on Ubuntu as well.



87

00:04:11.200 --> 00:04:12.760

You have openSUSE



88

00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:15.900

Wow, you even have Enterprise



89

00:04:15.900 --> 00:04:19.000

but for the time being, I am interested in Fedora



90

00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:21.200

and even though Fedora 21 came out



91

00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:22.660

and it says here Fedora 18



92

00:04:22.660 --> 00:04:24.520

that's perfectly fine.



93

00:04:24.520 --> 00:04:27.900

It's gonna run. No problems.



94

00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:29.600

Anyway, right next to it



95

00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:34.000

you have i386 and AMD64.



96

00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.200

What do these marcations mean?



97

00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:44.200

Well basically, they're just references to 32-bit and 64-bit architectures.



98

00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:47.000

If you do not know what your machine is



99

00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:50.100

whether it's 32-bit or 64-bit



100

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:51.600

well, no problems there.



101

00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:55.970

Just go ahead and open up your terminal



102

00:04:55.970 --> 00:05:00.800

Type in "uname -a"



103

00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.900

Press "Enter"



104

00:05:01.900 --> 00:05:03.300

You don't need to be root to do this.



105

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:05.400

You do this as pretty much any user



106

00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:08.800

and you get a listing of information here.



107

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:12.000

So you have Linux platform



108

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.200

localhost



109

00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.400

That's the domain.



110

00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.000

You have the version of the kernel



111

00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:20.690

and Fedora distribution as well.



112

00:05:20.690 --> 00:05:22.000

It's number 20



113

00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000

and then you have the architecture.



114

00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.100

So it's X86_64



115

00:05:27.100 --> 00:05:27.700

There we go.



116

00:05:27.700 --> 00:05:29.600

64-bit architecture.



117

00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:30.700

Fantastic



118

00:05:30.700 --> 00:05:33.700

Now that we have established that, we can



119

00:05:33.700 --> 00:05:37.800

you can actually go ahead and click on it.



120

00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:39.200

If you're using a 32-bit one



121

00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:40.800

just click on the 32-bit one.



122

00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:42.500

The procedure is absolutely the same.



123

00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:45.000

There are literally no differences.



124

00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:48.349

It gives me an option to save a file.



125

00:05:48.349 --> 00:05:50.800

So just click "Save" and then click "Okay"



126

00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.400

That will download the file for you in the default downloads folder



127

00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:58.550

unless you configured it in a different fashion.



128

00:05:58.550 --> 00:05:59.800

I'm just gonna go ahead and cancel it



129

00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:01.840

because as I said, I downloaded it previously



130

00:06:01.840 --> 00:06:04.700

in order to save some time in this

tutorial.



131

00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:06.500

Just cancel



132

00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:08.300

Go back to your terminal.



133

00:06:08.300 --> 00:06:10.010

Now clear the screen.



134

00:06:10.010 --> 00:06:13.530

You will need to be root in order to

do this.



135

00:06:13.530 --> 00:06:17.820

So just type in "SU", press "Enter, and type in your password



136

00:06:17.820 --> 00:06:22.600

and of course I got my password wrong.



137

00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:25.900

I'm quite famous for doing this.



138

00:06:25.900 --> 00:06:26.620

I don't know why



139

00:06:26.620 --> 00:06:29.400

but it's fine when I forget my passwords.



140

00:06:29.400 --> 00:06:33.129

When I forget my encryption keys, that can be a bit of a problem



141

00:06:33.129 --> 00:06:37.300

anyway there is a tool for managing RPM packets



142

00:06:37.300 --> 00:06:39.610

as this is a Red Hat distro.



143

00:06:39.610 --> 00:06:42.000

All the packets



144

00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.659

software packets for it



145

00:06:43.659 --> 00:06:46.959

I have an extension - ".rpm"



146

00:06:46.959 --> 00:06:49.500

Here, let me just go ahead and show this to you.



147

00:06:49.500 --> 00:06:52.059

I'm going to to go ahead and create a bigger zoom in



148

00:06:52.059 --> 00:06:55.600

so you can all see what I am doing here.



149

00:06:55.600 --> 00:06:58.800

Now, I am currently using the terminal



150

00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:01.500

and I will give more detailed explanations.



151

00:07:01.500 --> 00:07:03.569

I will instruct you in how to use it.



152

00:07:03.569 --> 00:07:06.889

I will explain pretty much all the commands that we will be using



153

00:07:06.889 --> 00:07:07.800

in great detail



154

00:07:07.800 --> 00:07:12.000

but for the time being, just tune in and follow through.



155

00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.619

So there's a command "ls"



156

00:07:13.619 --> 00:07:18.300

and then I want to go to the folder

downloads



157

00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:20.800

Home



158

00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:24.100

Chronic -- That's me. That's the username.



159

00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.000

Downloads



160

00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000

and VirtualBox. There we go.



161

00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:28.959

Press "Enter"



162

00:07:28.959 --> 00:07:31.800

I'm just gonna go ahead and clear screen one more time.



163

00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.000

There we go.



164

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.700

Got exactly the same thing but a better look.



165

00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:39.179

Anyway, you see this extension that I have marked?



166

00:07:39.179 --> 00:07:42.100

It says ".rpm"



167

00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:46.919

Now ".rpm" represents a type of packet that I stated previously



168

00:07:46.919 --> 00:07:50.309

that is meant specifically for certain

Linux distributions



169

00:07:50.309 --> 00:07:54.900

such as Red Hat, Fedora, Syntax, and a few others.



170

00:07:54.900 --> 00:08:00.100

What you can do is use your default RPM software.



171

00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:03.600

So just type in "rpm -i"



172

00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:06.600

"-i" argument is for installed



173

00:08:06.600 --> 00:08:10.500

and then specify the path of your packet.



174

00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:17.300

So home/Chronic/Downloads/VirtualBox



175

00:08:17.300 --> 00:08:18.679

and press Enter from here.



176

00:08:18.679 --> 00:08:21.700

Now again, this process is automated.



177

00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.300

There isn't much that you need to do here.



178

00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:26.900

Maybe press "Yes" and that's it along the way



179

00:08:26.900 --> 00:08:29.729

but in any case, this is not the method that you should be using.



180

00:08:29.729 --> 00:08:33.200

This is a method that I'm showing that

you CAN use



181

00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:37.100

but I wouldn't advise, as if you do install it like this



182

00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:38.700

it tends to break with newer updates



183

00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.229

so it can be a bit problematic.



184

00:08:40.229 --> 00:08:43.000

I will show you another method in the next tutorial



185

00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000

where you can actually use "yum", which is a default packet manager.



186

00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.700

in order to install this packet



187

00:08:48.700 --> 00:08:52.200

and then update it accordingly.



188

00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:54.400

In any case, I bid you farewell



189

00:08:54.400 --> 00:08:57.230

and I'll see you in the next tutorial, where I'll pick this up.
