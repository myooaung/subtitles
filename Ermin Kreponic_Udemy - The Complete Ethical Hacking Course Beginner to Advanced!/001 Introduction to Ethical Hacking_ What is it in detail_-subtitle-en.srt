00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
Hello everybody and welcome to this introductory video.

2
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,900
Today I will be talking ethical hacking

3
00:00:06,900 --> 00:00:11,000
and I will also introduce you to the course itself.

4
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:12,700
So first off, you might have noticed

5
00:00:12,700 --> 00:00:17,100
that the term "Ethical Hacking" is composed of two words:

6
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:19,300
You have "Ethical" and you have "Hacking".

7
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:22,800
Now hacking

8
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,200
The definition of hacking is quite broad.

9
00:00:25,200 --> 00:00:29,500
I mean, it encompasses a very wide range of activities.

10
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:33,700
However, if you actually go to any of the online dictionaries, pretty much

11
00:00:33,700 --> 00:00:36,200
and if you type in the term "Hacking"

12
00:00:36,200 --> 00:00:41,300
generally it will say that it has something to do with computers.

13
00:00:41,300 --> 00:00:43,200
I cannot say that that is not true

14
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,800
however, that is a small portion of the definition.

15
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,800
Rather instead, the act of hacking is actually having any system

16
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,500
and I mean any system.

17
00:00:54,500 --> 00:00:55,900
Not just a computer system

18
00:00:55,900 --> 00:00:57,700
Not just a digital system

19
00:00:57,700 --> 00:01:02,200
In fact, the system doesn't even need to contain any electrical parts.

20
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:09,800
So literally any system having it do something that you intended it to do

21
00:01:09,800 --> 00:01:12,570
as opposed to what it was designed to do.

22
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:16,500
Now here's one short example

23
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:20,600
that has been cited over and over again --

24
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:21,800
You have a lock basically

25
00:01:21,800 --> 00:01:23,400
You have a door lock in your house

26
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,000
Everybody has one

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:27,899
l sincerely hope that you have one

28
00:01:27,899 --> 00:01:34,259
and the purpose of that lock is used to prevent intruders.

29
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,900
So anybody that does not have a key cannot enter.

30
00:01:37,900 --> 00:01:41,200
But people enter without a key anyway

31
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:43,500
because they pick the lock and then they enter

32
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:47,300
and that itself could be considered an act of hacking.

33
00:01:47,300 --> 00:01:51,600
Also an act of burglary, but that's another subject.

34
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,600
Anyway, the ethical side of it

35
00:01:54,600 --> 00:02:01,300
would be when you have these large automobile industries

36
00:02:01,300 --> 00:02:03,329
Manufacturers

37
00:02:03,329 --> 00:02:05,200
Then they hire people

38
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:10,900
They hire these burglars to come and test their locks.

39
00:02:10,900 --> 00:02:14,600
So basically, they pay them very good sums of money

40
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:19,800
to go to their factories and try to unlock their cars.

41
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,600
This doesn't need to apply only to locks for cars.

42
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:27,000
It can also apply to your door locks.

43
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:29,400
Manufacturers have pretty much all sorts of locks.

44
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:34,000
They hire people to actually try and pick lock them

45
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:39,200
and then if they succeed doing it, they pay them a very good sum of money.

46
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,659
I do believe that prices for one car manufacturer

47
00:02:42,659 --> 00:02:47,200
went up to one million euros if you managed to break their locks

48
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,600
But what I am trying to say here is that the ethical side of it

49
00:02:51,600 --> 00:02:54,600
would be when you have a permission to do it.

50
00:02:54,600 --> 00:02:57,900
When it's within the constraints of the law

51
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,700
and the act of hacking itself can be within the constraints of the law

52
00:03:02,700 --> 00:03:06,000
But doesn't necessarily need to be.

53
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:12,000
Anyway, we will not be focusing on those types of locks today or during this course.

54
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,400
During this course, I will teach you how to penetrate networks

55
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,900
How to exploit systems

56
00:03:21,900 --> 00:03:23,500
How to break into computers

57
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:28,900
How to compromise routers, etc. You will
be able, after you finish this course you

58
00:03:28,900 --> 00:03:33,200
After you finish this course

59
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:34,299
After you've absorbed all the information in it

60
00:03:34,299 --> 00:03:42,299
You will gain the ability to do some serious damage.

61
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,300
Now because of that, I wish to give you a disclaimer here --

62
00:03:46,300 --> 00:03:51,100
So first off, I do not encourage any sort of illegal activity.

63
00:03:51,100 --> 00:03:57,000
Furthermore, I strongly advise against it and I am against it.

64
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:05,500
So you do not have any legit need to do anything that is against the law

65
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:09,200
with the knowledge that you are going to get during this course

66
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:11,300
because you are going to get some pretty good

67
00:04:11,300 --> 00:04:15,000
and you can abuse it very easily.

68
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:17,500
It's not that difficult to abuse it.

69
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
The opportunities are everywhere

70
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,100
They're endless because people tend to use insecure systems

71
00:04:24,100 --> 00:04:25,400
or they use secure systems

72
00:04:25,400 --> 00:04:28,500
but they don't know how to operate or configure them

73
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:32,800
and then in turn, those security systems
become insecure.

74
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,400
But what I'm trying to tell you is there really is no need.

75
00:04:37,400 --> 00:04:41,600
I mean, if you want to do it for the money or something like that

76
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:47,400
you can make same amount, if not more, in a perfectly legitimate way.

77
00:04:47,400 --> 00:04:51,400
People will pay you to actually test their networks

78
00:04:51,400 --> 00:04:56,300
and to see if you can find any vulnerabilities in them

79
00:04:56,300 --> 00:04:58,200
and then report them.

80
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:01,400
Perhaps even fix them.

81
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:07,000
However if you do decide to do something against the law

82
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,100
in any country, I am not responsible for it.

83
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:12,900
First off, that is what I want to say --

84
00:05:12,900 --> 00:05:16,000
I do not claim responsibility for it

85
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:21,900
as I have already stated that I am doing this purely for educational purposes

86
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:29,000
and I do not advocate the use of this material for any sort of illegal purposes.

87
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,500
Now I hope you understand why I had to make this disclaimer

88
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:35,900
and this is not

89
00:05:35,900 --> 00:05:37,900
what I said, these are not just empty words

90
00:05:37,900 --> 00:05:42,700
I really do stand by it, and that is my philosophy as well.

91
00:05:42,700 --> 00:05:46,780
In any case, during this course

92
00:05:46,780 --> 00:05:49,800
I will show you numerous examples

93
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:50,700
methods

94
00:05:50,700 --> 00:05:52,800
You will need some prerequisites

95
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,400
over which I will go in the next tutorial

96
00:05:57,400 --> 00:06:01,000
but you in for a ride, so sit down

97
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:02,100
be patient

98
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:05,000
That is a very important thing in this line of work.

99
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:10,300
Patience, because everybody out there

100
00:06:10,300 --> 00:06:12,700
I mean, if you are looking at this tutorial now

101
00:06:12,700 --> 00:06:15,100
if you type in the term "Ethical Hacking"

102
00:06:15,100 --> 00:06:20,100
I'm guessing at some point in your lives, like myself

103
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:23,700
you have seen a movie that involves
some sort of hacking with computers

104
00:06:23,700 --> 00:06:28,500
and you see this terminal and you just see them typing in something there

105
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:32,400
and it just basically works!

106
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:35,200
It works within five minutes or something like that.

107
00:06:35,200 --> 00:06:36,080
Let me tell you something --

108
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:42,400
that has nothing to do with the real world
or very little do with the real world.

109
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:48,700
In the real world, people spend countless
sleepless nights

110
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:52,000
trying to do something.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,100
Trying to obtain access

112
00:06:54,100 --> 00:07:00,200
Trying to bypass a password protected file or something of a kind in a server.

113
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:03,300
Trying to escalate privileges.

114
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:07,900
Trying to inject in, a SQL injection of something of a kind

115
00:07:07,900 --> 00:07:11,100
and they not only spend countless nights doing it

116
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:16,000
but they also spend a long time planning, preparing

117
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,210
and getting a general idea of what they can do

118
00:07:19,210 --> 00:07:22,000
how they can execute an attack, etc.

119
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,800
These are not things that you will be able to do within five minutes

120
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:32,530
after you sit and open up your desktop computer. Whatever.

121
00:07:32,530 --> 00:07:34,700
You will need time

122
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:36,500
You will need patience

123
00:07:36,500 --> 00:07:39,949
but above all, you will need to be curious.

124
00:07:39,949 --> 00:07:42,700
Curiosity is one of the first steps here

125
00:07:42,700 --> 00:07:48,000
and obviously, since you actually chosen to listen to this tutorial.

126
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:49,000
To go through it.

127
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:50,400
You do possess it already.

128
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,100
You just need to build on it a little bit more

129
00:07:53,100 --> 00:07:56,200
and you'll be where you want to be.

130
00:07:56,200 --> 00:08:02,150
In any case, I hope to see you in the next tutorial and I bid you farewell.
