1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everybody and welcome to this
tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,200
I have Kali Linux machine here running.

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,400
I have left installation process in the last tutorial

4
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,200
because it was, quite frankly, pointless to just sit there and wait through it

5
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:16,500
and wait for it to finish

6
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:22,000
primarily because Kali Linux installation tends to be a bit longer

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:24,900
than the installation of other Linux operating systems

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,400
primarily because of the prepackaged tools that come with it.

9
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,710
However, there were a few screenshots that I have made

10
00:00:32,710 --> 00:00:36,469
that some of the options that you were asked

11
00:00:36,469 --> 00:00:39,100
while the installation process was going on

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:41,500
so there were just three of them.

13
00:00:41,500 --> 00:00:45,000
I'm just gonna go ahead and open them up here.

14
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,300
So the first one that happened was that I was asked --

15
00:00:49,300 --> 00:00:51,899
Do you want to use a network mirror

16
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:59,800
to supplement the software that is included on the cd-rom?

17
00:00:59,800 --> 00:01:02,940
This may also make newer versions of
software available.

18
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,540
I said "no" because I'm gonna do an update

19
00:01:06,540 --> 00:01:09,540
as soon as I finish the installation process

20
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:12,580
and as soon as I configure everything in
the proper way.

21
00:01:12,580 --> 00:01:19,400
The update is the configuration that I'm going to do, so it doesn't matter.

22
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,000
No I do not want to use any mirrors or anything of the kind.

23
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,600
Just gonna say no

24
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:27,530
and go ahead and proceed with the installation.

25
00:01:27,530 --> 00:01:32,400
So next up is the GRUB

26
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:34,200
So GRUB boot loader

27
00:01:34,200 --> 00:01:35,549
It is asking me

28
00:01:35,549 --> 00:01:41,259
"Do you want to install GRUB boot loader to the master boot records?"

29
00:01:41,259 --> 00:01:42,800
Yes I do

30
00:01:42,800 --> 00:01:48,200
Just click on it, as this is the only operating system on this machine

31
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:49,280
on this computer.

32
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:55,000
There's nothing that I can mess up by
installing the GRUB boot loader

33
00:01:55,000 --> 00:01:58,800
to the master boot record of the first hard drive

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,270
as it is stated here in the instructions.

35
00:02:01,270 --> 00:02:05,100
You can use the GRUB boot loader in order to configure multiple boots

36
00:02:05,100 --> 00:02:09,900
or, I don't know, you can put 3 4 5 operating systems

37
00:02:09,900 --> 00:02:10,800
as many as you like

38
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:13,400
as many as your hardware can support

39
00:02:13,400 --> 00:02:15,000
not at the same time, of course

40
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,000
but at boot time, you will be prompted

41
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,300
and asked "Which operating system do you wish to boot?"

42
00:02:21,300 --> 00:02:25,000
That's also one of the options that you can have with GRUB

43
00:02:25,000 --> 00:02:28,530
but aside from that, just click "Yes" there.

44
00:02:28,530 --> 00:02:31,000
and there's a final one

45
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,220
It's simply states that the installation is complete

46
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:38,700
and if you had used a CD to complete this installation

47
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:40,600
or a USB or something of a kind

48
00:02:40,600 --> 00:02:44,000
you will need to remove that media

49
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:50,900
and reboot the system in order for all of this to function.

50
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:51,970
So that would be it.

51
00:02:51,970 --> 00:02:54,989
I was asked those three VERY simple questions

52
00:02:54,989 --> 00:02:57,100
You have the answers here.

53
00:02:57,100 --> 00:02:58,500
Just go through them

54
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,160
it will not make a difference in the final account things.

55
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:03,900
Just gonna go ahead and close this

56
00:03:03,900 --> 00:03:09,000
and now I'm gonna go ahead and log into my Kali Linux virtual machine

57
00:03:09,000 --> 00:03:10,510
So the user name is

58
00:03:10,510 --> 00:03:13,800
this is actually one of the rare occasions

59
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:15,800
actually this is pretty much the only occasions

60
00:03:15,800 --> 00:03:19,100
where I log into GUI with root.

61
00:03:19,100 --> 00:03:23,200
but as you will soon realize in Kali Linux

62
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:24,830
everybody just logs in with root

63
00:03:24,830 --> 00:03:30,000
primarily because you are not using Kali Linux to browse web

64
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:30,980
or something like that.

65
00:03:30,980 --> 00:03:37,000
You are usually using it 99% of time to perform some sort of an attack

66
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:39,190
and for all those tools, you need to be

67
00:03:39,190 --> 00:03:43,000
pretty much for all those tools, you need to be a root user

68
00:03:43,000 --> 00:03:46,600
or have root privileges.

69
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:53,280
Most the time there's no point to have any other users on a Kali Linux distro

70
00:03:53,290 --> 00:03:55,700
So type in "root"

71
00:03:55,700 --> 00:03:56,660
Press "Enter"

72
00:03:56,660 --> 00:03:58,100
Password was "test"

73
00:03:58,100 --> 00:03:58,900
Press "Enter"

74
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:02,200
Yours is whatever you appointed it to be

75
00:04:02,200 --> 00:04:05,600
Of course if it's a virtual machine, you don't need to worry that much

76
00:04:05,600 --> 00:04:09,140
but if it's your main machine or something like that

77
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:13,200
Kali is generally not recommended to be your main desktop machine

78
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:14,580
That's not a good idea.

79
00:04:14,580 --> 00:04:17,500
Rather run it as a virtual machine.

80
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,060
Okay, so first there are

81
00:04:19,060 --> 00:04:23,000
I need to do a few things, like updates

82
00:04:23,000 --> 00:04:26,919
in order for me to be able to install VirtualBox guest additions

83
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:32,200
so that we may use full screen and that we may use shared clipboard

84
00:04:32,200 --> 00:04:33,860
and so on and so forth.

85
00:04:33,860 --> 00:04:36,940
Just go ahead and change this.

86
00:04:36,940 --> 00:04:41,350
Open up my terminal and set the view.

87
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:44,400
This is non-technical stuff that you can do this you can configure anyway

88
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,000
This you can configure anyway you like.

89
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:47,169
I'm just zooming it in for the purposes of tutorial

90
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:50,270
so that you may see it better

91
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:52,500
but before we can do updates

92
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,000
before we can do ANYTHING

93
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,860
we must verify that we have connectivity to the internet.

94
00:04:59,860 --> 00:05:01,860
Here we go.

95
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:05,669
Nothing is happening, so I cannot ping yahoo.com

96
00:05:05,669 --> 00:05:08,740
meaning that I don't have exit to the
external network.

97
00:05:08,740 --> 00:05:13,000
I cannot a access the internet.

98
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,580
That's a pretty big problem because 
pretty much whatever we do

99
00:05:16,580 --> 00:05:20,139
we will need internet connectivity for it

100
00:05:20,139 --> 00:05:24,320
in order to download packets from the repositories, to perform updates

101
00:05:24,320 --> 00:05:27,600
and to conduct scans

102
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:28,800
possible scans

103
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,100
and so on and so forth.

104
00:05:30,100 --> 00:05:32,870
So just go ahead and click on "Devices"

105
00:05:32,870 --> 00:05:35,800
Find network

106
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:36,919
Network Settings

107
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,200
and here you can see by default, it will be set to NAT

108
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:43,979
but you don't want the NAT, you want "Bridged Adapter"

109
00:05:43,979 --> 00:05:46,700
and you want to choose your adapter here.

110
00:05:46,700 --> 00:05:48,419
Mine is p8p1

111
00:05:48,419 --> 00:05:53,000
See what yours is and click "Allow VMs"

112
00:05:53,000 --> 00:05:54,900
Virtual machines

113
00:05:54,900 --> 00:05:58,000
So okay, if you don't know what the adapter on your machine is

114
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:00,000
and you are using a Linux system

115
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,000
just go ahead, open up your terminal

116
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,309
and type in "ifconfig"

117
00:06:08,309 --> 00:06:12,900
Here you will be able to see a listing of adapters that you have.

118
00:06:12,900 --> 00:06:15,400
So you have lo, which is loopback.

119
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,000
You have p8p1, which is my ethernet connection

120
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:20,100
This is for some virtual machines as well

121
00:06:20,100 --> 00:06:24,000
and I have wlp2s0 which is my wireless interface

122
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,000
So I know that for a fact I'm using p8p1

123
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:29,919
primarily because my network manager tells me that I am.

124
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,000
You see connected to p8p1.

125
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:38,700
This is also a better way of actually checking what you are connected to

126
00:06:38,700 --> 00:06:40,300
and which adapter you are using.

127
00:06:40,300 --> 00:06:44,500
So just open up your network manager in the upper right corner

128
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:48,000
and look at p8p1 -- It says "connected"

129
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:50,300
Your network manager's position can vary

130
00:06:50,300 --> 00:06:52,300
depending on how you've configured your system.

131
00:06:52,300 --> 00:06:55,500
By default it will be in the bottom right corner

132
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,800
but that is easy enough to find either way.

133
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:02,129
Let's just go ahead and close this terminal

134
00:07:02,129 --> 00:07:05,800
now that we have actually configured our network.

135
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:07,400
Have we? Yes we have.

136
00:07:07,400 --> 00:07:10,900
but still, I'm pretty sure I won't have internet connectivity.

137
00:07:10,900 --> 00:07:12,339
Let me just try ping again

138
00:07:12,339 --> 00:07:14,800
and you see it is simply not working.

139
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,079
So there is a problem once again.

140
00:07:17,079 --> 00:07:20,500
So let's just go ahead and check the Kali Linux network manager

141
00:07:20,500 --> 00:07:24,100
and it says "Wired network but device not managed"

142
00:07:24,100 --> 00:07:25,200
That could be a problem

143
00:07:25,200 --> 00:07:29,500
and that is a general problem which you will face with wired interfaces.

144
00:07:29,500 --> 00:07:32,000
Pretty much all the time.

145
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,400
There's a relatively easy fix to it.

146
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:36,100
You just navigate over in the terminal

147
00:07:36,100 --> 00:07:38,600
You type in "cd", which stands for "change directory"

148
00:07:38,600 --> 00:07:42,419
to "etc network manager"

149
00:07:42,419 --> 00:07:43,700
Let's see what's in it.

150
00:07:43,700 --> 00:07:44,400
Excellent

151
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:48,900
We have NetworkManager.conf

152
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:51,400
I'm gonna go ahead and type in "nano"

153
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,300
which is the text editor that I am going to be using

154
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:58,600
and then type in NetworkManager.conf

155
00:07:58,600 --> 00:07:59,380
Press "Enter"

156
00:07:59,389 --> 00:08:00,800
There we go.

157
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,569
It opens up the configuration file.

158
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,400
You do need to be root in order to make any changes here.

159
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:08,800
It says "main, "plugins", "ifupdown", "keyfile"

160
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:11,900
"ifupdown", "managed=false"

161
00:08:11,900 --> 00:08:16,700
So where it says "false" , just delete this and type in "true"

162
00:08:16,700 --> 00:08:18,500
Control O to save

163
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:20,100
Press "Enter"

164
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:23,000
Control X to exit

165
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:26,600
Now we need to actually restart our network managers.

166
00:08:26,600 --> 00:08:31,000
So just go ahead and type in "service network"

167
00:08:31,000 --> 00:08:33,300
There we go.

168
00:08:33,300 --> 00:08:38,000
"network manager restart"

169
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,500
Stopping and starting.

170
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:41,900
Excellent

171
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:42,900
Connection established

172
00:08:42,900 --> 00:08:46,700
You are now connected to ifupdown (ath0)

173
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:48,220
Let's check the connectivity

174
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:53,400
So ping yahoo.com

175
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,200
Excellent

176
00:08:54,200 --> 00:08:56,140
So now we have internet connectivity

177
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:58,900
and pay attention to the steps here.

178
00:08:58,900 --> 00:09:00,800
They're quite important because

179
00:09:00,800 --> 00:09:04,700
not so much for the ethical hacking part

180
00:09:04,700 --> 00:09:08,200
as they are to actually setting up the environment

181
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,600
because setting up the environment itself can be troublesome.

182
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:15,000
You can encounter multiple problems, bugs, etc.

183
00:09:15,000 --> 00:09:18,010
and instead of having to go from one forum to the other

184
00:09:18,010 --> 00:09:21,300
trying to find a solution, you can just
go through this tutorial

185
00:09:21,300 --> 00:09:22,450
just pay a bit of attention

186
00:09:22,450 --> 00:09:27,300
and I will show you pretty much how to
resolve pretty much all the issues

187
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:28,400
that you might encounter

188
00:09:28,400 --> 00:09:30,700
because I myself am doing

189
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:32,380
I have done a fresh install here

190
00:09:32,380 --> 00:09:36,360
and I would be encountering the same
problems that anybody else would

191
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:39,000
and I would like to go over them

192
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,100
because more likely than not, if you are performing a virtual machine installation

193
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:46,400
you will encounter similar problems as I have.

194
00:09:46,400 --> 00:09:48,720
Although should you encounter any other problems

195
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,000
please feel free to pose questions

196
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,900
and I will be more than happy to provide any answers that I can.

197
00:09:57,900 --> 00:10:00,360
So let's just go ahead and clear the screen

198
00:10:00,360 --> 00:10:03,390
and now that we have internet connectivity

199
00:10:03,390 --> 00:10:10,100
I would like to perform some updates, which are necessary.

200
00:10:10,100 --> 00:10:14,900
Believe me, you need to perform regular updates of the system

201
00:10:14,900 --> 00:10:19,800
because you will find that certain things will not work after a while

202
00:10:19,800 --> 00:10:21,500
So let me just change directory

203
00:10:21,500 --> 00:10:22,700
Clear the screen again

204
00:10:22,700 --> 00:10:24,900
Type in "apt-get"

205
00:10:24,900 --> 00:10:27,220
"update"

206
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:29,700
So I could do this with one command in
Fedora

207
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:32,000
but here I'm gonna need two of them.

208
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:34,900
So it's picking up things from the repositories.

209
00:10:34,900 --> 00:10:35,600
Excellent

210
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:37,810
Now I need to type in "apt-get"

211
00:10:37,810 --> 00:10:40,000
"upgrade"

212
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:41,200
Press

213
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:42,400
and you see it says

214
00:10:42,400 --> 00:10:48,600
"After this operation, 73.7 MB of additional disk space will be used"

215
00:10:48,600 --> 00:10:52,000
This is this last sentence here that I am marking

216
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,700
and that is quite a bit, in terms of updates.

217
00:10:54,700 --> 00:10:56,300
I mean, look at all the packages.

218
00:10:56,300 --> 00:10:59,800
These are all the packages that are to be updated.

219
00:10:59,800 --> 00:11:02,000
List goes on and on

220
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,200
Well, there you go.

221
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,100
It starts from here and it doesn't end anytime soon

222
00:11:08,100 --> 00:11:09,250
It goes all the way down.

223
00:11:09,250 --> 00:11:11,800
So anyway, just type in "yes"

224
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:13,700
You don't actually need to type in capital Y.

225
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:14,700
You just type in "y"

226
00:11:14,700 --> 00:11:15,450
Press 'Enter"

227
00:11:15,450 --> 00:11:17,500
and the update process will start.

228
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,980
Now depending on your internet connection

229
00:11:19,980 --> 00:11:24,860
this might take shorter or longer amounts of time.

230
00:11:24,860 --> 00:11:28,330
I will end this tutorial here

231
00:11:28,330 --> 00:11:31,000
until the updates actually finish

232
00:11:31,000 --> 00:11:33,810
because I don't want to be standing here in front of the screen

233
00:11:33,810 --> 00:11:38,000
but in any case, these updates will finish until the end.

234
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:42,500
You're not gonna be posed any questions at a certain point of time

235
00:11:42,500 --> 00:11:43,600
during the update process.

236
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,070
You might be notified of some things.

237
00:11:46,070 --> 00:11:48,400
A screen might pop with some texts.

238
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:49,860
That's perfectly fine

239
00:11:49,860 --> 00:11:52,000
You can read through it and then close it.

240
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,060
Those are "Read Me" files

241
00:11:53,060 --> 00:11:57,000
specifying the characteristics of certain packages

242
00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,300
and what has been upgraded

243
00:11:58,300 --> 00:12:02,070
but don't go about just reading it there.

244
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,800
You can close it later on, if you wish

245
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:06,700
You can do further exploration

246
00:12:06,700 --> 00:12:10,900
and actually discover what each of these packages contains.

247
00:12:10,900 --> 00:12:15,700
In any case, we will continue this process in the follow up tutorial.

248
00:12:15,700 --> 00:12:17,900
Until then, I bid you all farewell.
