00:00:00,010 --> 00:00:03,000
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,000
Today, I'm just going to continue from where I left off

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,890
Anyway, go ahead and open up your browser.

4
00:00:10,890 --> 00:00:17,200
Let's just see what the IP address is

5
00:00:17,200 --> 00:00:19,400
So this is my IP address.

6
00:00:19,400 --> 00:00:20,500
Go ahead and copy it

7
00:00:20,500 --> 00:00:23,300
Yours will perhaps be different or something of a kind.

8
00:00:23,300 --> 00:00:24,100
Doesn't really matter

9
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:25,369
Just go ahead and copy it

10
00:00:25,369 --> 00:00:28,000
CTRL V into the URL

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,500
URL field of your browser

12
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:32,500
Paste it there

13
00:00:32,500 --> 00:00:34,300
Go ahead and open up your folder

14
00:00:34,300 --> 00:00:36,700
and immediately we encounter a problem here we need a

15
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:39,200
We need a username and a password.

16
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:41,000
Go ahead and open up your terminal.

17
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:47,200
These things are stored by default in your installation files.

18
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:49,000
Actually, they are in the read me files.

19
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:58,000
So in the instruction set, go ahead and type in "cd /var/www/

20
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:02,500
"cd DVWA - 1.0.8/ "

21
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:04,400
There we go. There is a read me file.

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,200
So let's just go ahead and open up the read me file

23
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,360
and you have a lot of explanations here.

24
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:13,500
Feel free go ahead and read through them.

25
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:18,600
Well, actually there aren't that much of it, but they were out there are some useful things.

26
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:25,000
So it says "Default username = admin" and "Default password = password"

27
00:01:25,000 --> 00:01:26,810
There is an installation video as well.

28
00:01:26,810 --> 00:01:28,200
I mean, I've already showed it to you

29
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,500
but you can go ahead and feel free to watch this version of it as well

30
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:36,500
I don't think you'll see anything extremely different

31
00:01:36,500 --> 00:01:45,000
but they use some to actually run the downloadable application.

32
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,700
I use a different type here, but it doesn't really matter.

33
00:01:49,700 --> 00:01:58,800
You can use the one that I am using, the one that comes as a default with Kali Linux operating system.

34
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,900
Anyway, as I said, feel free to check the link out

35
00:02:00,900 --> 00:02:04,400
but we've mainly opened this file to see the username and password

36
00:02:04,400 --> 00:02:06,460
and username is "admin" and password is "password"

37
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:07,900
Feel free to change that later on

38
00:02:07,900 --> 00:02:09,600
or don't, doesn't really matter

39
00:02:09,600 --> 00:02:13,000
since you're the only person using this virtual machine.

40
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:17,800
If this is your physical machine, it would be a good idea to actually change it.

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:25,700
So "admin", and down here I'm gonna go ahead and write "password"

42
00:02:25,700 --> 00:02:30,000
but since you are using a bridged adapter in VirtualBox

43
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,500
perhaps it would good idea to change it indeed

44
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:42,000
but for the time being, let's just go ahead and see what's up for the offer here.

45
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:44,500
So you have a lot of these types of attacks.

46
00:02:44,500 --> 00:02:55,000
You have Brute Force, Command Execution, CSRF, SQL Injection, File Inclusion, etc.

47
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:55,800
There are a lot of them.

48
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,900
I will go through some of them

49
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:00,500
I won't go through all of them, obviously

50
00:03:00,500 --> 00:03:02,100
but I will go through some, as I said

51
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,500
through a significant amount anyway

52
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,080
and down below, you have DVWA security

53
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,600
so go ahead and click on that.

54
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,100
You are able to set your security level of this web application, in general.

55
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:15,700
It can be low, medium or high.

56
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:18,900
I would recommend that you go with high

57
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:25,500
primarily because that's going to reflect the real time circumstances to the greatest degree.

58
00:03:25,500 --> 00:03:28,800
If you go with low, pretty much everything you do, it's gonna fly

59
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,500
which is not the case in the real world.

60
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:34,800
Anyway, now that this is set on high

61
00:03:34,800 --> 00:03:37,400
click on submit to remember changes

62
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,000
and go ahead and click on "SQL injection (Blind)"

63
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,900
Now this is where usually people type these things in

64
00:03:46,900 --> 00:03:49,700
and you might think "Oh well, that's not the case in the real world"

65
00:03:49,700 --> 00:03:53,800
"We don't have a neat clear field where we can type the things in"

66
00:03:53,800 --> 00:03:56,900
but just keep in mind this is just for your convenience.

67
00:03:56,900 --> 00:03:59,400
This is just for convenience sake.

68
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:05,100
If I just click on empty submit, you can see up here in the URL section there

69
00:04:05,100 --> 00:04:09,200
it says "id=", and then there's nothing there

70
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:15,359
So whatever I was typing in here would basically be set to id=

71
00:04:15,359 --> 00:04:18,400
So let's type in 3333 and submit.

72
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:19,000
There you go

73
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:21,600
It says "id=3333"

74
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:28,400
So in the real world, you would be typing these things up here in the id section or something of a kind.

75
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,300
While here, they've just constructed a neat field where you can type these things in

76
00:04:34,300 --> 00:04:36,200
As I said, it doesn't really matter all the things

77
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:39,500
All the things you type in the user id field

78
00:04:39,500 --> 00:04:42,539
you feel you can also type in here, in the URL and the

79
00:04:42,539 --> 00:04:45,800
and the effect will be exactly the same.

80
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,639
There is literally no difference whatsoever.

81
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,400
Anyway, now that we have our security parameters set up and that the environment is set up

82
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,500
that we've managed to log into it

83
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:02,500
let's go ahead and start up burp suite

84
00:05:02,500 --> 00:05:03,600
Why do we need burp suite?

85
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:06,500
Burp suite will create a proxy for us.

86
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:10,000
We need it in order to capture some information.

87
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:15,500
Primarily we need to the capture the session cookie

88
00:05:15,500 --> 00:05:18,700
so that we can use it later on with the SQL map

89
00:05:18,700 --> 00:05:23,600
primarily because we have actually logged into a website

90
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:27,500
and we need to enable our SQL map to actually request the field

91
00:05:27,500 --> 00:05:32,000
and go past the authenticated with the session id cookie.

92
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:33,120
This is also good method

93
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,000
primarily because most of the sites out there will allow you to create some sort of a basic user

94
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,030
and at the registration site, at the main login site

95
00:05:42,030 --> 00:05:45,000
there are countless countermeasures.

96
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:50,400
There are intrusion detection systems

97
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,900
If they see something is up, the red flags will be raised

98
00:05:53,900 --> 00:05:58,200
your IP will be banned, and then you will need to change the IP.

99
00:05:58,200 --> 00:06:00,260
A ton load of things will be there.

100
00:06:00,260 --> 00:06:06,100
Almost all the security systems will be focused primarily on that page

101
00:06:06,100 --> 00:06:07,300
and that can be a problem

102
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:13,300
but if you manage to create even a regular user, any kind of user

103
00:06:13,300 --> 00:06:16,800
if you just type in some credentials there, whatever

104
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,500
log in, then suddenly a lot of sites

105
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,000
and this is a really bad thing for lot of websites out there

106
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,000
A lot of these systems tend to simply disappear.

107
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:38,500
All the fields past any authentication are pretty much neglected

108
00:06:38,500 --> 00:06:41,809
and there are a lot more fields and there's a far greater possibility that the mistakes have made somewhere

109
00:06:41,809 --> 00:06:44,829
and that

110
00:06:44,829 --> 00:06:52,000
and that you can actually make some sort of an exploit there using an SQL injection method.

111
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:57,000
However, if you can't create any sort of users or anything of a kind

112
00:06:57,000 --> 00:06:59,900
you will actually need to attack the login page itself.

113
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:03,100
In that case, I do not believe that you will need a session id

114
00:07:03,100 --> 00:07:04,300
Although you can still get it.

115
00:07:04,300 --> 00:07:08,200
Now keep in mind that this is your browser that we're dealing with

116
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,600
and we can do with it whatever we want

117
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,900
even though this website is somewhere in a remote site

118
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:17,300
we can do whatever we want with this browser

119
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:25,300
in order to conveniently capture the information that goes between us and the website

120
00:07:25,300 --> 00:07:27,500
in order to use it  SQL map.

121
00:07:27,500 --> 00:07:30,200
For that, we need to use burp suite, as I have said.

122
00:07:30,200 --> 00:07:34,000
So go ahead and open up another terminal.

123
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:44,000
log in as root, type in "burpsuite, press ENTER

124
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:49,000
If you're running it the first time around, you might be asked to accept the license agreement

125
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,000
and to provide anonymous feedback.

126
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:54,900
Whether you provide anonymous feedback or not, the choice is entirely yours

127
00:07:54,900 --> 00:07:58,000
but you do need to agree to the Terms of Use.

128
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,049
As I said you don't actually provide any sort of feedback whatsoever

129
00:08:02,049 --> 00:08:07,200
they've just included that as an option, but you can disable it and it's fine

130
00:08:07,200 --> 00:08:12,000
The program won't actually send anything in regards to you.

131
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,200
Anyway, we have the burp suite running up.

132
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:18,700
Go ahead, and in the upper left corner, click on proxy

133
00:08:18,700 --> 00:08:20,800
Click on intercept

134
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:23,500
Actually, you can click on options in the right

135
00:08:23,500 --> 00:08:29,300
and make sure that 127.0.0.1 8080 is selected.

136
00:08:29,300 --> 00:08:31,200
It will be selected by default.

137
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:34,870
I have created some other things down below, but don't pay any attention to that.

138
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:36,900
Go back to intercept

139
00:08:36,900 --> 00:08:42,200
Make sure that the intercept is on and not off.

140
00:08:42,200 --> 00:08:49,800
Go ahead and minimize your terminals, go back to your web browser, click on edit

141
00:08:49,800 --> 00:09:00,400
preferences, advanced, network, settings, click on manual proxy configuration

142
00:09:00,400 --> 00:09:02,000
and make sure that you have these things typed in.

143
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:06,800
So 127.0.0.1 port 8080

144
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:12,000
Use proxy server for all particles.

145
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:12,900
There you go

146
00:09:12,900 --> 00:09:15,500
So those are pretty much the only setting that you need to type in.

147
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:21,400
You need to type in the loopback IP address and you need to write in the port number.

148
00:09:21,400 --> 00:09:24,400
The port number is 8080

149
00:09:24,400 --> 00:09:30,200
Click "Okay", close, reload the site

150
00:09:30,200 --> 00:09:34,900
and of course, the site won't actually be able to reload until you let it through.

151
00:09:34,900 --> 00:09:40,300
So you can immediately see that the burp suite has managed to capture information here

152
00:09:40,300 --> 00:09:43,880
and it is waiting for you to tell us what you want to do with it.

153
00:09:43,890 --> 00:09:45,700
So you can either forward it, you can drop it

154
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:52,000
and there are actions here to send it through a lot of other functionalities in burp suite

155
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,500
but for the time being, I'm going to copy the URL

156
00:09:54,500 --> 00:09:59,400
So go ahead and click on "action", copy URL

157
00:09:59,400 --> 00:10:04,000
Open up your text editor, whichever one you want

158
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:09,800
I don't know, the burp suite has some sort of problems copying these things

159
00:10:09,800 --> 00:10:18,750
I have no idea why.

160
00:10:18,750 --> 00:10:23,500
Let's see if it's gonna work like this.

161
00:10:23,500 --> 00:10:24,300
Excellent

162
00:10:24,300 --> 00:10:34,200
So if it doesn't work the first time around, just try to do it again and usually it will work

163
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:37,000
and if it doesn't work, try it again and again

164
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:38,400
and a couple of times like that.

165
00:10:38,400 --> 00:10:42,700
So if it doesn't work after a couple of times, there's some sort of a serious problem.

166
00:10:42,700 --> 00:10:46,000
If it does work, fantastic

167
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,800
Anyway, you see that the site is still spinning and nothing has happened.

168
00:10:49,800 --> 00:10:55,000
I can just click on forward and the site will load in the back.

169
00:10:55,000 --> 00:10:59,670
Intercept still on, but we don't actually...Oh yes we do.

170
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:01,700
Okay, so I do apologize

171
00:11:01,700 --> 00:11:04,500
I actually forgot to take one more thing out of this.

172
00:11:04,500 --> 00:11:08,800
Let's just repeat the process.

173
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:18,200
So you see if you reload the site

174
00:11:18,200 --> 00:11:19,300
Excellent

175
00:11:19,300 --> 00:11:21,800
So you see where it says cookie

176
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:27,000
Security high...blah blah blah...Whatever

177
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:30,770
...some other things down below that not even God can read...

178
00:11:30,770 --> 00:11:36,500
and then you have PHP ESSID

179
00:11:36,500 --> 00:11:37,500
Copy that

180
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,190
That is your cookie session ID and you will need it.

181
00:11:41,190 --> 00:11:46,200
So go ahead and copy it, open up your text editor

182
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,400
and right below the URL, go ahead and type this cookie session ID

183
00:11:51,400 --> 00:11:52,200
Excellent

184
00:11:52,200 --> 00:11:56,200
So now you can feel free to close the burp suite

185
00:11:56,200 --> 00:12:00,000
"Are sure you want to exit?" Yes I am sure.

186
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:02,500
You can see when I shut the proxy

187
00:12:02,500 --> 00:12:04,800
since my browser is configured to go through a proxy

188
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:09,300
it's gonna shut down immediately and it's not going to be able to do anything.

189
00:12:09,300 --> 00:12:15,300
You will effectively render your browser unable to surf the web at all

190
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:16,800
You won't be able to use it to surf the web.

191
00:12:16,800 --> 00:12:22,500
So go ahead back to settings, click on "use system proxy settings, click on "Okay"

192
00:12:22,500 --> 00:12:24,890
close, try again, and there we go.

193
00:12:24,890 --> 00:12:29,000
Then it does work without any sort of problems.

194
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:32,000
Now that we have taken some information...

195
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,600
Remember, all of this that you're doing

196
00:12:34,600 --> 00:12:36,890
you are doing on your own machine

197
00:12:36,890 --> 00:12:39,700
the only thing that is remote here is this website.

198
00:12:39,700 --> 00:12:41,800
So you can configure your browser any way you like.

199
00:12:41,800 --> 00:12:44,600
We've simply used burp suite to extract certain information.

200
00:12:44,600 --> 00:12:47,900
We wanted a cookie session and we wanted the exact URL

201
00:12:47,900 --> 00:12:50,700
Well you could have gotten the URL from here, to be honest

202
00:12:50,700 --> 00:12:55,600
but it doesn't really matter, I wanted to get the cookie session ID

203
00:12:55,600 --> 00:13:01,700
There are some other ways and other methods, but I decided to use this one in particular with the burp suite

204
00:13:01,700 --> 00:13:09,200
and in the follow-up tutorial, we're gonna use the SQL map in order to try to do something here.

205
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:11,700
To see if we can find some vulnerabilities.

206
00:13:11,700 --> 00:13:16,700
To see if we can actually perform a scan and eventually extract some information.

207
00:13:16,700 --> 00:13:19,200
Until then, I bid you all farewell

208
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:22,000
and wish you a ton load of luck with this.
