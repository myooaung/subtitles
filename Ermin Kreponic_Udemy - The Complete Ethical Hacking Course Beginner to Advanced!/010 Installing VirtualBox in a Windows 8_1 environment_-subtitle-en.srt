00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,100
Hello everybody and welcome to this
tutorial.

2
00:00:03,100 --> 00:00:05,450
Today I will show you how to install VirtualBox

3
00:00:05,450 --> 00:00:08,700
within a Windows environment

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:12,100
So previously I've showed you how to do it in a Linux environment

5
00:00:12,100 --> 00:00:14,000
and it is a bit more complex there

6
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,200
because you do need to add repositories

7
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:19,570
and then pull the packet from the repositories.

8
00:00:19,570 --> 00:00:20,800
You can also pull it from the website

9
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,020
but that's not recommended.

10
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:25,910
However in Windows, the process is
fairly straightforward.

11
00:00:25,910 --> 00:00:27,000
It's fairly simple.

12
00:00:27,000 --> 00:00:29,700
You just go ahead, open up your favorite browser

13
00:00:29,700 --> 00:00:32,000
mine is Firefox

14
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:35,800
and go ahead and type in "VirtualBox"

15
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:37,000
Press "Enter"

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,860
and go ahead and open up their website.

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,000
Takes a bit to load.

18
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Don't know what the problem is.

19
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,510
Perhaps my internet connection is slow.

20
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:45,300
Nevermind

21
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:47,300
Just click on "Downloads"

22
00:00:47,300 --> 00:00:53,500
and choose "VirtualBox for 3.22 for Windows hosts"

23
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,700
So just go ahead and click on it

24
00:00:55,700 --> 00:00:57,300
and I don't want to download it now

25
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:01,800
because I've downloaded it prior to this tutorial in order to save some time

26
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:05,900
but since you didn't, just go ahead and
click on "Save File"

27
00:01:05,900 --> 00:01:07,300
and it will download it.

28
00:01:07,300 --> 00:01:09,510
The download process will start.

29
00:01:09,510 --> 00:01:14,200
I'm just gonna go ahead and navigate
over to my downloads folder.

30
00:01:14,200 --> 00:01:16,000
I have it right here

31
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:17,990
I'm just going to go ahead and double click on it

32
00:01:17,990 --> 00:01:21,700
in order to initiate the installation wizard.

33
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:26,049
Keep in mind that this Windows is actually a virtual machine

34
00:01:26,049 --> 00:01:30,439
and I am conducting an installation of VirtualBox

35
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:36,000
within a machine that is being run within yet another VirtualBox.

36
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,100
So a virtual machine within a a virtual machine

37
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:41,900
would be a proper way to name the
situation.

38
00:01:41,900 --> 00:01:43,090
You can see I've minimized it

39
00:01:43,090 --> 00:01:45,000
that I can pull it now

40
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:46,500
but it works just fine.

41
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,000
The installation process will go, no problems.

42
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:54,000
It will go fairly smoothly without any problems.

43
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,500
So just go ahead and click "Next" in these options.

44
00:01:56,500 --> 00:02:00,500
You can actually browse for different installation locations here

45
00:02:00,500 --> 00:02:02,400
but the default one will do just fine.

46
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:04,000
So just go ahead and click "Next"

47
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:05,170
"Create shortcuts"

48
00:02:05,170 --> 00:02:06,900
"Register file association"

49
00:02:06,900 --> 00:02:07,800
Sure, why not?

50
00:02:07,800 --> 00:02:09,149
Click "Next"

51
00:02:09,149 --> 00:02:12,900
This warning is basically telling you

52
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:15,000
that it will reset your network connection

53
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,600
So if you don't want that to happen

54
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:21,800
you might hold the installation process or something like that

55
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:24,200
but don't worry, even if you're downloading something.

56
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:26,600
It's not a big deal if your interfaces are reset

57
00:02:26,600 --> 00:02:30,000
your connection goes down and then it comes back up again

58
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,100
and your download might just stop for a while

59
00:02:32,100 --> 00:02:32,600
and that's it.

60
00:02:32,600 --> 00:02:34,900
Continue on later.

61
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:37,010
Anyway, just go ahead and click "Yes"

62
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,800
Install and there we go...

63
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,849
Oops! This is...no it is a not an error or something like that

64
00:02:44,849 --> 00:02:49,400
It's just Windows asking for our permission.

65
00:02:49,400 --> 00:02:53,970
Anyway, the installation process has started here, no problems

66
00:02:53,970 --> 00:02:56,200
and as I was talking about previously

67
00:02:56,200 --> 00:02:58,489
this is a virtual macine within a virtual machine.

68
00:02:58,489 --> 00:03:03,400
The installation of the program will go
fine, no problems.

69
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,800
However, if you plan to run another virtual machine

70
00:03:07,800 --> 00:03:09,200
within this VirtualBox

71
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:10,579
within this virtual machine

72
00:03:10,579 --> 00:03:13,730
you might encounter some problems.

73
00:03:13,730 --> 00:03:17,160
So start VirtualBox after installation.

74
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:17,660
Finish

75
00:03:17,660 --> 00:03:18,900
Sure, why not?

76
00:03:18,900 --> 00:03:21,200
and as I said, you might encounter some problems

77
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,100
performance-wise

78
00:03:22,100 --> 00:03:26,160
because, I mean, you would need to have crazy good hardware

79
00:03:26,160 --> 00:03:28,400
in order to accomplish this feat.

80
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:30,000
I believe I could do it

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,500
but to the point that the virtual OS would function

82
00:03:36,500 --> 00:03:39,200
but to a very limited extent

83
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:40,000
and that's it.

84
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:44,300
I don't think I could actually do any meaningful work with it

85
00:03:44,300 --> 00:03:46,200
That would be quite difficult to achieve.

86
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:47,430
But in any case

87
00:03:47,430 --> 00:03:50,560
we have our VirtualBox manager here.

88
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:52,000
I'm spinning it around

89
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:56,400
and the process of creating pretty much new virtual machines

90
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,489
is exactly the same, more or less.

91
00:03:58,489 --> 00:04:02,190
The options have the same places

92
00:04:02,190 --> 00:04:04,700
so you'll be able to follow this tutorial through

93
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:06,120
even if you are using Windows

94
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:08,700
and have created a virtual machine.

95
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:10,169
For the most part, anyway.

96
00:04:10,169 --> 00:04:14,700
I'm just gonna go ahead and close it now.

97
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:16,000
I will uninstall it here

98
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,970
because it is completely pointless for the time being.

99
00:04:17,970 --> 00:04:19,300
But in any case

100
00:04:19,300 --> 00:04:23,900
I hope that this was helpful to all the Windows users out there

101
00:04:23,900 --> 00:04:25,000
because, let's face it

102
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,000
a lot of people do use Windows.

103
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:29,850
However, for pen testing purposes

104
00:04:29,850 --> 00:04:31,600
for ethical hacking

105
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,500
Windows is not the best operating system to use out there

106
00:04:35,500 --> 00:04:39,700
primarily because it's a lot harder to become anonymous with Windows

107
00:04:39,700 --> 00:04:40,740
to an anonymize yourself

108
00:04:40,740 --> 00:04:44,710
and furthermore most the pen testing hacking tools

109
00:04:44,710 --> 00:04:48,970
were actually designed for Unix/Linux
like environments

110
00:04:48,970 --> 00:04:52,300
to work in combination with their
terminals.

111
00:04:52,300 --> 00:04:57,910
However, the choice of the operating system is completely up to you.

112
00:04:57,910 --> 00:05:01,290
I will be working with Fedora, Linux

113
00:05:01,290 --> 00:05:04,600
and I will most likely be using this
Windows machine

114
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,400
as some sort of a victim

115
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:10,000
which we will be attacking and exploiting.

116
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,000
Anyway, I bid you all farewell

117
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:15,110
and I hope to see you in the next tutorial.
