00:00:00.020 --> 00:00:05.000

Hello and welcome back to this tutorial.



2

00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.650

Now this thing has finished.



3

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:10.800

As you can see, it says "no column(s) found"



4

00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.000

This can happen. Perfectly legit thing to happen.



5

00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.500

Let's try something else.



6

00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:22.100

You see there is a table user, but there are no columns in it



7

00:00:22.100 --> 00:00:24.600

so nothing has been placed within it



8

00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:29.300

and that can be a pain, but oh well.



9

00:00:29.300 --> 00:00:30.900

It does happen from time to time.



10

00:00:30.900 --> 00:00:33.500

I deliberately left it here just so I can show it to you.



11

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:34.829

Let's try a different one.



12

00:00:34.829 --> 00:00:38.000

Let's try the one that I know that there's useful stuff in.



13

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:44.000

So "dvwa --tables"



14

00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.500

Excellent



15

00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:49.000

It immediately fetches it.



16

00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:54.300

Now keep in mind that I am doing this locally.



17

00:00:54.300 --> 00:01:00.500

So the web server is on the same machine from which the attack is being generated



18

00:01:00.500 --> 00:01:02.200

and that gives me a speed advantage.



19

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.000

That gives me a tremendous speed advantage



20

00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.800

that enables me to do something really fast.



21

00:01:07.800 --> 00:01:11.800

However if you are out there on the net and if you have a slow connection



22

00:01:11.800 --> 00:01:13.800

if the database is far away



23

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:17.759

and even worse, if the connection is bad on the other end



24

00:01:17.759 --> 00:01:19.000

this can take a while.



25

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.740

So these things tend to take good amount of time



26

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:25.500

and don't be surprised if it runs for a while



27

00:01:25.500 --> 00:01:30.000

because that's just the reality that we have to accept and live with.



28

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.600

Anyway, we got users, we got guestbook



29

00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.400

so let's have a look at users



30

00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:38.800

because I noted there was something useful there



31

00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.300

but you won't know



32

00:01:40.300 --> 00:01:43.100

so go through all of them.



33

00:01:43.100 --> 00:01:48.000

If you're doing a genuine pen test, go through everything that you can get.



34

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.600

Go through every single day table, go through every single column



35

00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.300

go through every single database



36

00:01:53.300 --> 00:01:54.600

and see what is in there.



37

00:01:54.600 --> 00:01:59.500

I cannot emphasize this enough how many times that people suffer needlessly



38

00:01:59.500 --> 00:02:05.500

primarily because they were just too lazy to go through the stuff that they already had.



39

00:02:05.500 --> 00:02:12.500

So let's just go ahead and type in "-T users"



40

00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:14.400

and you cannot tabify anything here.



41

00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:16.700

You gotta type in everything pretty much manually



42

00:02:16.700 --> 00:02:20.500

which is a drag, but that's the way it is.



43

00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:22.000

Press ENTER



44

00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.000

Excellent! So there we go.



45

00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:26.200

This finished really fast.



46

00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:29.200

As I said, this is not going to be the case in the real world



47

00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:32.800

or maybe it will, but it is very unlikely



48

00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.000

primarily because of the speed limitations.



49

00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.800

Anyway, we got a column here.



50

00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800

We have a type



51

00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:43.720

Type tells us what sort of information is stored within this column.



52

00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:47.900

For example, "int" is number.



53

00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:49.500

So, an integer



54

00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.000

That's the English word for it.



55

00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000

Integer is a whole number



56

00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.150

So 123456, or 0



57

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:04.600

If by any chance it says "unsigned int", then it doesn't have any negative numbers



58

00:03:04.600 --> 00:03:05.520

but if it just "int"



59

00:03:05.520 --> 00:03:07.900

It can be, I don't know, minus 12345



60

00:03:07.900 --> 00:03:08.800

Whatever



61

00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.500

Now 1.26 is not an integer.



62

00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:16.000

It is a floating point number.



63

00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.840

So if you have "int",  basically just means numbers.



64

00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:19.340

That's it



65

00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.720

"varchar" I'm pretty sure that's just characters, strings.



66

00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:25.500

Some sort of strings placed in there



67

00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:30.000

It could be like complex strings, where you...



68

00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:31.200

Sorry, not complex strings



69

00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:34.000

just regular strings, where you can have spaces.



70

00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.930

It could be these strings



71

00:03:35.930 --> 00:03:40.500

where you have like every individual characters or something like that.



72

00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.800

I'm not exactly sure how that works.



73

00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:48.200

I would have to revise some of my programs because I'm not really good with theory



74

00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.000

but I can make it work in practice.



75

00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.200

Anyway, soon enough you will see what is contained within those columns



76

00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:58.400

and then you'll be able to judge for yourselves.



77

00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:02.000

If I've made some mistakes here, please

forgive me.



78

00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.900

So just go ahead and delete this



79

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:07.500

and type in "-C user"



80

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:09.700

and this is basically column



81

00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:15.100

So C for column, T for table, D for database



82

00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:16.200

Really simple



83

00:04:16.200 --> 00:04:17.300

Plain English language



84

00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:23.400

There aren't any complicated sets of commands that you need to type in here.



85

00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:26.400

For example, here the only thing that you need to pay attention at



86

00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:28.000

is the limiter for cookies.



87

00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:33.900

So, semicolon basically takes apart two types of cookies



88

00:04:33.900 --> 00:04:36.250

and you it specify here.



89

00:04:36.250 --> 00:04:37.600

The cookie, and you specify it here



90

00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.300

and just say equals, equals, and this.



91

00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:43.000

So no big deal there.



92

00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.870

Mainly just equal signs, slashes, colons, semicolons, etc.



93

00:04:47.870 --> 00:04:54.400

dashes, but when you're passing arguments to a program



94

00:04:54.400 --> 00:05:01.800

usually those arguments will reflect their purpose.



95

00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:03.760

For example, you want to list columns



96

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.500

What are you gonna do? Type  -C for colons.



97

00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:08.800

You want tables? -T for tables



98

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:11.500

Databases? -D for databases



99

00:05:11.500 --> 00:05:12.400

Very simple



100

00:05:12.400 --> 00:05:15.700

You don't teach through invest much thought into it.



101

00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:19.000

It's plain and simple English language



102

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.400

and if I want more than one column



103

00:05:21.400 --> 00:05:25.000

I can just type in comma and specify another one.



104

00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:26.500

It's pretty easy



105

00:05:26.500 --> 00:05:27.800

so no big deal there.



106

00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:32.900

I can say "password", and I'm gonna go ahead...



107

00:05:32.900 --> 00:05:37.500

Sure, let's take the first name and last name as well.



108

00:05:37.500 --> 00:05:46.200

"first_name, last_name"



109

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.600

Excellent



110

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:52.000

These things can be pretty long and you don't want to type all of them



111

00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.479

So, why not? Well you don't have the screen for it basically.



112

00:05:57.479 --> 00:06:01.000

If you have too many of these things, they will crowd your screen



113

00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:03.400

and you won't be able to see anything.



114

00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.200

You won't be able to make heads or tails out of it.



115

00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:11.300

So just take a smaller amount of columns at a time



116

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:13.200

like take two or three, maybe four.



117

00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.000

I have pretty big screen here -- Let's see if it's going to fit or not.



118

00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.400

Okay, so shutting down.



119

00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:35.000

What happened here?



120

00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:42.600

Okay, I probably misspelled something.



121

00:06:42.600 --> 00:06:45.200

Okay, let's just take user and password



122

00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:53.000

and then take first name and last name separately.



123

00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.500

Ugh, come on, what are you doing to me?



124

00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.000

Let's check the command out once more



125

00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:07.000

Ugh, of course. I've been taking it all but I didn't dump it anywhere



126

00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.500

I'm a brilliant person



127

00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.200

"do you want to store hashes to a temporary fie for eventual further processing with other tools"



128

00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:17.300

Now, what just happened to me...



129

00:07:17.300 --> 00:07:21.900

These things tend to happen to anyone, no matter at what level



130

00:07:21.900 --> 00:07:23.000

so don't worry about it.



131

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.900

Just don't lose your nerves over it.



132

00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:28.100

I cannot emphasize enough how important it is to stay calm.



133

00:07:28.100 --> 00:07:30.500

If you can stay calm



134

00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:33.959

leave the machine as it is, lock it



135

00:07:33.959 --> 00:07:38.199

go have a walk or something or take a glass of water



136

00:07:38.199 --> 00:07:40.200

or tea, whatever



137

00:07:40.200 --> 00:07:43.000

Come back after 15 minutes and continue working.



138

00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.600

Believe me, you will figure out a solution far faster than just smashing against your keyboard



139

00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:49.400

or something of a kind.



140

00:07:49.400 --> 00:07:57.700

Anyway, it says "1337", "Hack", "Me", and then we have some sort of hash here.



141

00:07:57.700 --> 00:08:00.199

That's probably a password



142

00:08:00.199 --> 00:08:03.400

depending on how we actually use this.



143

00:08:03.400 --> 00:08:13.000

So it says "fetching columns 'user, first_name, last_name, password"



144

00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.600

What do we got here?



145

00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:18.600

Ah, there we go



146

00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:22.500

So apparently these are "admin", "admin",  "admin"



147

00:08:22.500 --> 00:08:24.000

"gordonb"



148

00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000

So this is the first name, this is the last name



149

00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000

and what on earth have I requested here?



150

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:35.000

Let's just have a look.



151

00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:38.000

Apparently this is the user.



152

00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.900

So that would be the username, I'm guessing



153

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:44.200

but we will see this very shortly



154

00:08:44.200 --> 00:08:48.200

but just by looking at this, you can conclude a lot.



155

00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:52.000

So I'm guessing this is the first name, this is the last name



156

00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:59.800

this is the password, and this is what you type in as a user.



157

00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:02.000

Yup, gordonb



158

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:04.300

and it says "Gordon", and then "Brown", and then a hash.



159

00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.400

Yup, I do believe that I am correct



160

00:09:07.400 --> 00:09:11.000

Next up, as I said, there's this question it's asking you.



161

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.800

So you can store these hashes, and then individually crack them



162

00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:15.860

because you cannot use them as they are.



163

00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:20.500

You need to actually figure out a password from this.



164

00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.800

If the password is shorter



165

00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:28.900

if it's some sort of a word from an English dictionary or something like that



166

00:09:28.900 --> 00:09:31.800

combined with some numbers or something of a kind



167

00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.200

yes sure, it can be cracked within a reasonable amount of time.



168

00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:40.500

If you have some sort of a password like me on my main machine...



169

00:09:40.500 --> 00:09:45.000

No, you're just not gonna be able to crack it.



170

00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:53.000

Even if you were able to crack eight million pass attempts per second



171

00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.600

attempt to crack it eight million times per second



172

00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:57.180

it would take you more than a decade



173

00:09:57.180 --> 00:09:58.800

Far more than a decade



174

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:00.800

I can't calculate that



175

00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:06.500

but usually that means that the password is longer than, I don't know, eight characters



176

00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.200

and that it has all sorts of things it it



177

00:10:09.200 --> 00:10:17.700

I don't know, like numbers, signs, capital letters, lower case letters, etc



178

00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:21.300

This can be problematic, especially in the realm of 12 or 13



179

00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:23.800

then goodbye.



180

00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.000

You're not going to be able to crack this hash.



181

00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.200

You're better off at attempting to do something else



182

00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:33.900

but anyway, for this for this tutorial



183

00:10:33.900 --> 00:10:37.200

we're going to try to crack it with a default dictionary that is here



184

00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:41.800

but you could also at implement other dictionaries and you can use other tools as well



185

00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:43.630

to crack these hashes.



186

00:10:43.630 --> 00:10:47.850

You can implement customized dictionaries, you can implement custom ranges



187

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:51.800

and then generate passwords from those ranges to attempt to crack this



188

00:10:51.800 --> 00:10:53.370

and stuff of a kind.



189

00:10:53.370 --> 00:10:57.180

There are a good amount of options out there for you but



190

00:10:57.180 --> 00:11:01.000

but just a reminder



191

00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:08.500

You would not believe, I mean you literally would not believe the sort of passwords people use



192

00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:14.500

on their main servers, on their gateway routers



193

00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:20.500

which are the entry points to their networks  and the building or something like that.



194

00:11:20.500 --> 00:11:24.900

I don't know, I have seen passwords literally on a router



195

00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:29.460

which is used to exit onto the internet for a company



196

00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.200

Username "admin", password "admin"



197

00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:35.510

How fascinating can that be?



198

00:11:35.510 --> 00:11:40.700

I don't know, people actually sometimes don't pay attention to these things



199

00:11:40.700 --> 00:11:45.000

but there are a large amount of passwords out there



200

00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:50.000

which simply are not of any use.



201

00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:53.000

If you can get the hash, you will crack it for sure



202

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000

So be optimistic as far as that part is concerned



203

00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000

but from time to time, you will encounter somebody that actually uses proper passwords



204

00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:04.220

and you simply won't be able to do anything but the hash there



205

00:12:04.220 --> 00:12:06.200

but there are always other methods, as I said



206

00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:10.580

Anyway, you can store them,  but I don't want store them.



207

00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:19.800

Let's give SQL map to actually crack them with a default dictionary.



208

00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:25.600

There is a dictionary based attack, so you can type in yes



209

00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:29.700

"default dictionary file"



210

00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:35.000

Okay, so you can use as default and you can specify a custom file.



211

00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.500

Custom dictionary file you can download from the net.



212

00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:42.000

Just type in dictionary files for password brute force or something like that.



213

00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.400

You can get them pretty much on a lot of places on the net.



214

00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:49.130

Try to find the ones that is most suited to your purpose.



215

00:12:49.130 --> 00:12:56.500

In your search queries on the net, type

in what sort of a password are you trying to crack.



216

00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:02.500

Perhaps what type of site is it or something of a kind.



217

00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:10.000

You can also have "file with a list of the directory files", which is very interesting as well.



218

00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:14.000

So you can have a list of the directory files within a file



219

00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000

and you can try multiple dictionaries from websites.



220

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000

The good thing with this is that you don't need necessarily store all the dictionaries on your computer



221

00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:25.800

because they can be pretty large.



222

00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:31.900

You can store a couple, try them out, delete them, download a couple of others



223

00:13:31.900 --> 00:13:34.400

try them out and so on and so forth.



224

00:13:34.400 --> 00:13:38.200

Anyway, I'm just gonna use the default one, which is press ENTER



225

00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:42.000

"do you want to use common password suffixes?"



226

00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.200

No, I don't want them.



227

00:13:45.200 --> 00:13:47.800

Let's see what you're gonna do, how you're gonna crack it.



228

00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:52.400

It says "multiprocessing hash cracking is currently not supported on this platform"



229

00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.000

I am on a virtual machine, so give me

give me a break here.



230

00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000

This is working as fast as it possibly can.



231

00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000

It only has one processor core assigned to it if I didn't actually do anything



232

00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.200

So you see there is stuff happening here



233

00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.700

It's doing some of the things



234

00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.300

"do you want to crack them via a dictionary-based attack?"



235

00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:21.800

Okay, I think this is asking me for my current username and password that I am using.



236

00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:23.000

Sure, why not?



237

00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.000

You see it says admin admin admin



238

00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.900

That's what I've been using.



239

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.800

It says "password"



240

00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:35.000

and there is the hash for a password and then there is the actual password



241

00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.500

last_name, first_name, user



242

00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:44.000

If we go back up, you can see that we have actually retrieved pretty much everything



243

00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.000

for other users on the site.



244

00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.600

So we've cracked this one, we've cracked this, cracked this one, this one as well



245

00:14:52.600 --> 00:14:58.700

and okay, I do admit this is generally not the type of a password people will use



246

00:14:58.700 --> 00:15:03.500

but they will probably use something relatively similar.



247

00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:06.000

Maybe they'll be a couple of numbers or something like that



248

00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:12.000

which is nothing too difficult to crack, especially if it's a dictionary word or an English name.



249

00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.500

That's gonna fly for sure



250

00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:25.500

Anyway, you can use these credentials to log into a website and basically obtain access



251

00:15:25.500 --> 00:15:27.200

especially if you can log in as admin.



252

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.200

That's kind of ridiculous, but yeah



253

00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:33.200

Anyway, what I want to say here is...



254

00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:35.700

I don't know, sometimes people have asked me



255

00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:38.300

"Well, you have the hash. Like why can't you do that?"



256

00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.200

"Why can't you pass it as a password? Isn't that the same thing?"



257

00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:46.000

No, not really because the website on the other end



258

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:49.200

it takes this word as a password



259

00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:52.100

it runs it through some sort of mathematical algorithm



260

00:15:52.100 --> 00:15:55.300

which converts it into this.



261

00:15:55.300 --> 00:16:01.600

It encrypts it in essence, and then it compares what has encrypted here



262

00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:04.000

and compares the encrypted form of this.



263

00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:11.800

So it compares the encrypted form of "Charley"  to the encryption



264

00:16:11.800 --> 00:16:20.500

which is stored within its own tables somewhere on the server disks



265

00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:25.700

If you were to pass this in, this would get encrypted



266

00:16:25.700 --> 00:16:31.800

and it wouldn't be the same as the encrypted version of Charley.



267

00:16:31.800 --> 00:16:34.000

So you can't actually pass this.



268

00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000

There is a method called "Pass the hash" for Windows password cracking



269

00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.800

but that is a subject for another time.



270

00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:44.700

If you wish, feel free to take a look at it on the net.



271

00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:51.200

Anyway, I bid you farewell and I hope to continue this in the follow-up tutorial.



272

00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.000

We'll see what we will do there.



273

00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.000

Until then, I bid you farewell.
