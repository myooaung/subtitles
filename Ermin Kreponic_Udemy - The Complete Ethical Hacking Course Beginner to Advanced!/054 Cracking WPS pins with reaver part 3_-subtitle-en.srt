00:00:00,150 --> 00:00:02,710
Hello everybody, and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,710 --> 00:00:08,650
Today I will show you how to circumvent
that problem when the router locks.

3
00:00:08,650 --> 00:00:14,670
And is unable to receive any requests for
PIN authentication.

4
00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:18,684
Now there are two scenarios
that could happen here.

5
00:00:18,684 --> 00:00:24,408
One of them is that a router locks out for
a certain period of time,

6
00:00:24,408 --> 00:00:28,690
let's say for five minutes,
an hour, or a day.

7
00:00:28,690 --> 00:00:29,980
Or you have routers,

8
00:00:29,980 --> 00:00:35,490
which after too many unsuccessful attempts
at PIN authentication, just disable VPS.

9
00:00:36,950 --> 00:00:38,770
That can be very problematic.

10
00:00:38,770 --> 00:00:42,090
That is probably the worst part of it all.

11
00:00:42,090 --> 00:00:45,748
Because you don't really have any legit
ways of resetting the router remotely.

12
00:00:45,748 --> 00:00:51,520
There are some tools out there
that claim they can do this.

13
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:52,720
I think MDK3.

14
00:00:52,720 --> 00:00:57,364
You can use it to effectively

15
00:00:57,364 --> 00:01:02,000
reset router lock outs, but remotely.

16
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:04,170
However, that only works
on really old routers.

17
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,350
And I've basically searched
through the forums and

18
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:10,640
searched again just to be certain of this.

19
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,338
It's not very likely to work
on any of the newer routers.

20
00:01:13,338 --> 00:01:18,100
But, you can just think of
it in a logical fashion.

21
00:01:18,100 --> 00:01:22,567
If the router somewhere out there locks
you out, and you are unable to attempt any

22
00:01:22,567 --> 00:01:27,620
more PIN authentication
per a unit of time.

23
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,360
You can actually DoS it so
nobody else is able to connect to it.

24
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:35,280
And then, more likely than not,
the owner of the router, or

25
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,960
whoever is in control of the router.

26
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,940
Will reset it in order to
see if that will fix it.

27
00:01:42,940 --> 00:01:48,062
Once the router is reset,
the PIN lockout will disappear,

28
00:01:48,062 --> 00:01:51,140
and you will be able to try it again.

29
00:01:51,140 --> 00:01:55,730
I will show you how to DoS routers a bit
later on, wireless routers especially, and

30
00:01:55,730 --> 00:01:57,970
some other things as well.

31
00:01:57,970 --> 00:02:02,880
But for the time being,
I have a simpler solution for you.

32
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:08,526
Solution that is generally
applied is that you limit river

33
00:02:08,526 --> 00:02:13,430
to attempt a certain amount of
PINs in a certain amount of time.

34
00:02:13,430 --> 00:02:16,940
So let's say two PINs in 60 seconds.

35
00:02:16,940 --> 00:02:19,910
Or five PINs in 60 seconds or
something like that.

36
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:21,790
You can even tell it,
just do one after another.

37
00:02:21,790 --> 00:02:23,579
But that's bound to fail.

38
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,810
Without further ado, let's just go ahead
and try it, and see will it actually work.

39
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:33,570
But, before we do, I have made
a small script for myself, here.

40
00:02:33,570 --> 00:02:36,360
To enable monitor mode
on my wireless card.

41
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:38,570
You can have a look at it,
and copy it if you like.

42
00:02:38,570 --> 00:02:42,424
But it's just a list of commands
that I have used before.

43
00:02:42,424 --> 00:02:47,469
Let's go less monitor.sh.

44
00:02:47,469 --> 00:02:51,136
And this is my script,
basically it's a batch script.

45
00:02:51,136 --> 00:02:51,990
And I have four commands in it.

46
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:57,110
It's ifconfig wlps2s0 down,
to bring my wireless interface down.

47
00:02:57,110 --> 00:03:05,420
And then iwconfig wlps2s0 to
enable the monitor mode on it.

48
00:03:05,420 --> 00:03:09,580
Bring it back up, and
I want it to report back to me.

49
00:03:09,580 --> 00:03:16,880
And tell me that and confirm that
the monitor mode is actually running.

50
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:19,675
So let's just go ahead and do that.

51
00:03:19,675 --> 00:03:20,360
./monitor.sh.

52
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:20,930
Excellent.

53
00:03:20,930 --> 00:03:23,850
So you see, it says here, Mode:Monitor.

54
00:03:23,850 --> 00:03:27,250
And I know that probably my network
manager is going to interfere with this.

55
00:03:27,250 --> 00:03:34,350
So I'm just going to do
service NetworkManager stop.

56
00:03:34,350 --> 00:03:36,070
So that's gone.

57
00:03:36,070 --> 00:03:38,920
And then I clear the screen.

58
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:43,557
Now what I need to do is,
well I can either do wash.

59
00:03:43,557 --> 00:03:50,250
wash -i wlp2s0 and see if that will work.

60
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:52,100
No, it will not, why?

61
00:03:52,100 --> 00:03:53,310
Just go ahead and see.

62
00:03:53,310 --> 00:03:56,160
I have fig.

63
00:03:59,090 --> 00:04:01,440
Its not up for some strange reason.

64
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:05,810
Give us just,
Let's see if I can do that again.

65
00:04:05,810 --> 00:04:10,713
And I'm going to clear the screen.

66
00:04:10,713 --> 00:04:15,132
Do wash-i wlp2s0.

67
00:04:15,132 --> 00:04:17,336
Press enter, there we go.

68
00:04:17,336 --> 00:04:21,227
Probably, the interface went down with the
network manager for some strange reason.

69
00:04:21,227 --> 00:04:23,929
But doesn't really matter now.

70
00:04:23,929 --> 00:04:26,312
Anyway, wash -i, as I said before,

71
00:04:26,312 --> 00:04:31,305
it tells you which wireless access points
in the neighborhood are vulnerable.

72
00:04:31,305 --> 00:04:34,880
We have this one, so I'm just going
to cancel it here and close it.

73
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,205
You can also check the signal.

74
00:04:38,205 --> 00:04:41,165
I've showed you how to do
that in a previous tutorial.

75
00:04:41,165 --> 00:04:42,462
But let's just go ahead and
try to do this.

76
00:04:42,462 --> 00:04:47,362
And attempt to bypass this limiting

77
00:04:47,362 --> 00:04:51,623
rate VPS bin authentication.

78
00:04:51,623 --> 00:04:58,510
So, reaver -i wlp2s0, which is my
wireless interface, space -b 4.

79
00:04:58,510 --> 00:05:06,230
At the BSSID here, let's just go ahead and
copy it, paste it here.

80
00:05:06,230 --> 00:05:10,830
And what I need next is actually
recursive attempts, -r,

81
00:05:10,830 --> 00:05:13,940
Here I can specify the amount of tries.

82
00:05:13,940 --> 00:05:16,800
So let's say I want to
have two tries colon.

83
00:05:17,930 --> 00:05:18,440
Per 60 seconds.

84
00:05:20,390 --> 00:05:22,800
Fairly simple, no problems there.

85
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:27,870
Just by adding this command here you can
bypass pretty much the lock out problems.

86
00:05:27,870 --> 00:05:31,130
But if you get locked out with this.

87
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:34,960
Try decreasing the amount of tries,
or increasing the amount of time.

88
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:37,540
Eventually it has to work.

89
00:05:37,540 --> 00:05:43,440
Because every router out there
has a limitation on these things.

90
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,720
They have basically say if you have
that many tries in that amount of time,

91
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:49,380
then lock out.

92
00:05:49,380 --> 00:05:52,820
It's an if statement basically.

93
00:05:52,820 --> 00:05:53,800
If that act like this.

94
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:54,960
If not, act like this.

95
00:05:57,010 --> 00:05:58,560
They have to have a limit here.

96
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,490
They can't just say,
they cannot put infinite values here.

97
00:06:01,490 --> 00:06:03,300
They have to say basically,

98
00:06:03,300 --> 00:06:06,820
if you get that many tries in
that amount of time, lock out.

99
00:06:06,820 --> 00:06:10,440
And as long as you can be above that,
the router will not lock out.

100
00:06:10,440 --> 00:06:13,190
It will work well for you.

101
00:06:13,190 --> 00:06:17,860
If you're wondering how to get
the individual lockout timers for routers.

102
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,800
Well there is no simple answer for this.

103
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:23,180
You've got to go on the net and search.

104
00:06:23,180 --> 00:06:24,510
Sometimes you will find it,
sometimes you won't.

105
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:29,040
It depends people have reversed engineered
some of the firm ware on the routers.

106
00:06:29,040 --> 00:06:32,050
And have figured these things out,
but not on all of them.

107
00:06:32,050 --> 00:06:35,270
However, the fool proof method is just
simply to try a couple of times, and

108
00:06:35,270 --> 00:06:37,302
see if it works.

109
00:06:37,302 --> 00:06:41,760
And see when it works
when you do not get it.

110
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:46,130
When you don't get the error message,
and you're good to go after that.

111
00:06:46,130 --> 00:06:48,920
After that you can just leave
your computer running, and

112
00:06:48,920 --> 00:06:49,910
its bound to break it.

113
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:54,636
However, the problem here is that
this will increase the amount of time

114
00:06:54,636 --> 00:06:57,647
required to crack the pin, exponentially.

115
00:06:57,647 --> 00:06:59,892
It might take you up to
three weeks to break it.

116
00:06:59,892 --> 00:07:03,760
I think that was the longest.

117
00:07:05,060 --> 00:07:09,140
But still, if you just think about it,
three weeks is not a huge amount of time.

118
00:07:09,140 --> 00:07:11,554
It is still within the realm of possible.

119
00:07:11,554 --> 00:07:15,303
Especially if you are trying to
pen test something somewhere.

120
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:20,581
Or, If you have access to a position
where you can actually transmit

121
00:07:20,581 --> 00:07:25,502
this sort of signal in order to
attempt these authentication.

122
00:07:25,502 --> 00:07:29,017
In order to attempt the authentication
via VPS, or something of the kind.

123
00:07:29,017 --> 00:07:31,949
However, there was
a downside to it especially

124
00:07:31,949 --> 00:07:34,889
if you are functioning
on a limited timetable.

125
00:07:34,889 --> 00:07:38,850
And if you don't have that much
time It can be very problematic.

126
00:07:38,850 --> 00:07:43,844
There are some other methods,
which I'm gonna show to you in a moment.

127
00:07:43,844 --> 00:07:48,009
Which can bypass,
restore previous session?

128
00:07:48,009 --> 00:07:50,799
Nah, I don't want to
restore previous session.

129
00:07:50,799 --> 00:07:51,933
Let's just go with this one.

130
00:07:51,933 --> 00:07:59,024
Because I have reset my router
in order to actually unlock it.

131
00:07:59,024 --> 00:08:00,050
As I did lock it previously,
and that was a problem.

132
00:08:02,100 --> 00:08:05,930
So I have, while this is running,
let's just.

133
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,970
Oh, I didn't specify the channel.

134
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:11,760
You don't actually need
to specify the channel.

135
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,080
But if you want it to work,

136
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:15,760
you want to increase the speed of it,
you definitely should.

137
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:16,880
So it's channel six.

138
00:08:18,190 --> 00:08:19,030
Excellent.

139
00:08:19,030 --> 00:08:19,850
Press enter.

140
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:21,450
No, don't restore.

141
00:08:21,450 --> 00:08:22,320
Nothing.

142
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:24,690
Just go ahead, associate with it.

143
00:08:24,690 --> 00:08:25,600
And attempt these pin combinations.

144
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:28,020
Anyway, you will see that
nothing is really happening.

145
00:08:28,020 --> 00:08:31,100
Because I have told it two
attempts every 60 seconds.

146
00:08:31,100 --> 00:08:36,665
And it's going to take a while
before you see anything here.

147
00:08:36,665 --> 00:08:40,820
Meanwhile, let's just
go over to Kali Linux.

148
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,376
I have downloaded a script
from the net here.

149
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:49,180
Let's just zoom it in.

150
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:54,390
So, this script will work for
dealing routers.

151
00:08:54,390 --> 00:08:59,330
Now, there are various scripts on the net
that will help you figure out what the pin

152
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:04,340
is, before you even begin
the pin authentication.

153
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:08,650
Now here's the catch.

154
00:09:08,650 --> 00:09:13,190
Every router out there
needs to have an algorithm

155
00:09:13,190 --> 00:09:17,050
with which it can generate these PINs.

156
00:09:17,050 --> 00:09:22,430
Since people have reverse-engineered
these functions, which generate PINs.

157
00:09:22,430 --> 00:09:26,378
You can predict what PINs
which routers will have.

158
00:09:26,378 --> 00:09:31,900
For example, D-Link routers generate their
PINs based upon their MAC addresses.

159
00:09:31,900 --> 00:09:33,580
Which anybody can see.

160
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:35,890
So generally their PINs based

161
00:09:37,220 --> 00:09:39,810
on the first part of their MAC addresses,
which is terrible.

162
00:09:39,810 --> 00:09:43,060
For example,
this script exact does the reverse.

163
00:09:43,060 --> 00:09:44,270
Reverses the process.

164
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:46,100
Actually, duplicates the process.

165
00:09:46,100 --> 00:09:48,870
You just feed it the mac address,
and that's it.

166
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:50,446
Here, let me just show it to you.

167
00:09:50,446 --> 00:09:55,090
The script, you can actually
see it on the browser behind.

168
00:09:55,090 --> 00:09:58,560
But I'm just going to nano pinGen.py.

169
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,470
Excellent.
So I have some coloring options here.

170
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:04,760
And let's just zoom it in one more time so
you can see it better.

171
00:10:04,760 --> 00:10:06,010
So here's the code.

172
00:10:06,010 --> 00:10:08,630
And you don't need to understand
the code to the fullest of extents.

173
00:10:08,630 --> 00:10:10,890
If you wish you can exploit a bit further.

174
00:10:10,890 --> 00:10:12,150
The code is fairly simple,

175
00:10:12,150 --> 00:10:16,210
it is written in Python,
which is a programming language.

176
00:10:16,210 --> 00:10:19,370
All it does is takes the MAC address,
splits it in two.

177
00:10:19,370 --> 00:10:21,260
Uses that to feed the function.

178
00:10:22,310 --> 00:10:26,040
And then that function, based upon
the variables that were passed to it,

179
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:29,400
can generate the default
pin of the router.

180
00:10:30,550 --> 00:10:34,160
That can be very helpful especially for
dealing with routers.

181
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:38,050
The first thing you can try, you can try
the default pin for a specific router.

182
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:39,550
Because every router out
there that has VPS enabled,

183
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:42,410
also has a default pin which
is enabled by default.

184
00:10:42,410 --> 00:10:46,220
And it is not likely that
people will change this.

185
00:10:46,220 --> 00:10:49,533
Therefore, you are able to do this.

186
00:10:49,533 --> 00:10:52,225
Basically pinGen.py.

187
00:10:52,225 --> 00:10:57,227
I've just downloaded
this from the internet.

188
00:10:57,227 --> 00:11:02,845
Here is the website that I
have downloaded it from.

189
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:10,120
You can just type VPS algorithm
reversed for D-Link routers.

190
00:11:10,120 --> 00:11:12,291
But, I am reluctant to give you a link.

191
00:11:12,291 --> 00:11:17,210
Primarily because It's not very
likely that you will be using

192
00:11:17,210 --> 00:11:20,300
this specific D-Link router that
I am using to demonstrate here.

193
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:25,530
You'll probably have some other router
with which you will want to try this.

194
00:11:25,530 --> 00:11:29,720
And therefore, it is best,
it is absolutely best, that you

195
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:34,450
just use the model of the router that
you have, or that you wish to pen test.

196
00:11:34,450 --> 00:11:39,010
And then search the VPS algorithm for
that particular router, or

197
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:40,610
something equivalent to that.

198
00:11:40,610 --> 00:11:43,730
You won't find the VPS algorithm always.

199
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:46,020
But it's worth a shot, why not.

200
00:11:46,020 --> 00:11:49,570
Just type into your favorite search
engine vps algorithm for, and

201
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:54,430
then the model number or
just the name of the brand of the router.

202
00:11:54,430 --> 00:11:57,850
Like TP-LINK or Wowway or
something of a kind.

203
00:11:57,850 --> 00:11:59,290
It doesn't really matter.

204
00:11:59,290 --> 00:12:01,724
Anyway I have pinGen.py here.

205
00:12:01,724 --> 00:12:07,061
And if I just pass in the MAC address

206
00:12:07,061 --> 00:12:12,960
of any of these, it doesn't matter.

207
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:18,120
Just in case, I'm gonna stick
to the one that belongs to me.

208
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:19,390
So I wouldn't reveal any information here,

209
00:12:19,390 --> 00:12:21,450
not that anybody would be
able to make any use of it.

210
00:12:21,450 --> 00:12:23,410
I mean, you're too far away anyway.

211
00:12:23,410 --> 00:12:29,308
So just paste the MAC address here, and
feed that MAC address to this script.

212
00:12:29,308 --> 00:12:31,780
Press enter and
you will get the default pin.

213
00:12:31,780 --> 00:12:35,170
Now obviously this is not
the default pin of my router.

214
00:12:35,170 --> 00:12:38,330
But because I don't have a D-Link router.

215
00:12:38,330 --> 00:12:42,540
But for TP-Link route for
D-Link routers it's gonna work.

216
00:12:42,540 --> 00:12:45,790
It's gonna give you default pins.

217
00:12:45,790 --> 00:12:49,190
And you will be able to
authenticate from the first try.

218
00:12:49,190 --> 00:12:50,320
Which is very nice.

219
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:52,250
It saves you a ton load of time.

220
00:12:53,590 --> 00:12:59,510
These things are router specific,
and you do need to search the net.

221
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:04,140
The internet is your
best friend to find VPS

222
00:13:04,140 --> 00:13:08,520
algorithm functions that
generate it basically.

223
00:13:08,520 --> 00:13:11,130
This is going very slow.

224
00:13:11,130 --> 00:13:13,840
I have not asked it to
double the vv option.

225
00:13:13,840 --> 00:13:15,050
Excellent, so

226
00:13:15,050 --> 00:13:20,920
you see we can actually change the values
here in the command of the reaver.

227
00:13:20,920 --> 00:13:22,390
And even though you've changed the value,

228
00:13:22,390 --> 00:13:23,700
even though you changed
the arguments here.

229
00:13:23,700 --> 00:13:27,510
It will still tell you if you
want to restore from the previous

230
00:13:29,180 --> 00:13:31,380
session, with the updated arguments.

231
00:13:33,030 --> 00:13:33,780
And, here we go.

232
00:13:33,780 --> 00:13:37,100
I have triggered the AP rate limiting.

233
00:13:37,100 --> 00:13:42,310
It says waiting 60 seconds
before re-checking.

234
00:13:42,310 --> 00:13:44,870
That can be problematic,
as this doesn't seem to work.

235
00:13:45,880 --> 00:13:50,870
Well you need to increase this to four,
or five, or something like this.

236
00:13:50,870 --> 00:13:51,960
But sorry, not this.

237
00:13:51,960 --> 00:13:52,931
We need to decrease this,
or leave it the same.

238
00:13:52,931 --> 00:13:54,841
But increase the amount of time.

239
00:13:54,841 --> 00:14:01,475
I've learned that on my particular router,
a setting of 300 seconds we will do.

240
00:14:01,475 --> 00:14:06,020
And if you do, I don't know, two tries per
300 seconds, or something of the kind.

241
00:14:06,020 --> 00:14:07,730
It's not going to lock out.

242
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,410
But I have given a very small value here.

243
00:14:10,410 --> 00:14:13,880
And that's why we have
faced a lock out here.

244
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:16,410
However, If you play
around with these values,

245
00:14:16,410 --> 00:14:21,520
you will find that after a while
you won't get any lock outs what so

246
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:26,990
ever if you set this number,
the timer up higher a little bit.

247
00:14:26,990 --> 00:14:28,840
Anyway, I will continue on this.

248
00:14:28,840 --> 00:14:31,360
I will continue with this
wireless cracking process in

249
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:32,520
the follow up tutorial.

250
00:14:32,520 --> 00:14:35,660
As there are a few more
things to cover here.

251
00:14:35,660 --> 00:14:39,240
But don't be disencouraged
if you fail at first.

252
00:14:39,240 --> 00:14:43,460
If you get these error messages or
something like that.

253
00:14:43,460 --> 00:14:47,990
Just play around with the timers, and
eventually you will get the hang of it.

254
00:14:47,990 --> 00:14:53,810
Eventually you will no longer get AP
rate limiting or anything of a kind.

255
00:14:54,950 --> 00:15:00,410
In the following tutorial, what I am going
to do is show you the authentication

256
00:15:00,410 --> 00:15:04,080
methods, And how you can basically shut
down all connections to that router,

257
00:15:04,080 --> 00:15:08,350
in order to force the user to reset
the router, or something of a kind.

258
00:15:08,350 --> 00:15:11,330
Because there is no way
that they can detect you.

259
00:15:11,330 --> 00:15:13,570
Or it's highly unlikely
that they will detect you.

260
00:15:13,570 --> 00:15:15,520
That they will find
your physical location.

261
00:15:15,520 --> 00:15:18,360
That is while your
performing a DoS attack.

262
00:15:18,360 --> 00:15:20,270
Especially if you change the MAC address.

263
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:27,640
If you're doing this sort of thing, please
remember to always change the MAC address.

264
00:15:27,640 --> 00:15:31,610
So there's no way it can be traced
back to you in a physical sense.

265
00:15:31,610 --> 00:15:36,507
But you can't be located anyway.

266
00:15:36,507 --> 00:15:38,970
I suppose through some complex methods,

267
00:15:38,970 --> 00:15:43,590
your physical location could be
discovered with a four meter discrepancy.

268
00:15:43,590 --> 00:15:44,800
So, if you're in a bar or
something like that.

269
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,520
There are five people using a laptop,
or a pad, or something like that.

270
00:15:48,520 --> 00:15:49,620
There's just no way.

271
00:15:49,620 --> 00:15:52,812
There's too many people to go over.

272
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:56,960
And, I mean they would have
to use directional antennas.

273
00:15:56,960 --> 00:16:00,471
And it would basically be a manhunt,
or something of a kind.

274
00:16:00,471 --> 00:16:02,875
But you're not gonna get that far,

275
00:16:02,875 --> 00:16:08,262
primarily because you will always have
a permission to do these sort of things.

276
00:16:08,262 --> 00:16:10,935
Anyway, I bid you farewell
until the next tutorial.

277
00:16:10,935 --> 00:16:13,562
Where we shall be dealing with
the DoS attacks of wireless.

278
00:16:13,562 --> 00:16:17,748
And forced restart of these
routers in order, again,

279
00:16:17,748 --> 00:16:21,395
to avoid this error
detected AP rate limiting.

280
00:16:21,395 --> 00:16:25,189
Anyway, I bid you farewell,
and I hope to see you then.
