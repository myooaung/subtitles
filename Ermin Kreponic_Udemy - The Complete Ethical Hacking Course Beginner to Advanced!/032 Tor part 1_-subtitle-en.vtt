00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.320

Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.320 --> 00:00:08.283

Today I will open up a chapter on how to stay anonymous



3

00:00:08.283 --> 00:00:11.464

So there's several ways, several methods that you can use



4

00:00:11.464 --> 00:00:15.205

first off, you probably heard about these things, they are proxies



5

00:00:15.205 --> 00:00:18.724

So you are just routing your connection throught several



6

00:00:18.724 --> 00:00:21.022

different points althought this can be very



7

00:00:21.022 --> 00:00:23.239

slow depending on the speed of the proxies



8

00:00:23.239 --> 00:00:28.012

elsewhere, and you also know nothing



9

00:00:28.012 --> 00:00:30.998

of the other site, you know nothing of the



10

00:00:30.998 --> 00:00:33.161

servers through which your packets are



11

00:00:33.161 --> 00:00:33.737

going



12

00:00:33.737 --> 00:00:34.660

so that can be risky



13

00:00:34.660 --> 00:00:38.322

but then again, if you're just scanning something



14

00:00:38.322 --> 00:00:42.248

If you're using Nmap to footprint a newtork



15

00:00:42.248 --> 00:00:43.724

why do you care?



16

00:00:43.724 --> 00:00:46.198

It's not of importance.



17

00:00:46.198 --> 00:00:51.799

However, if you're using proxies to log in somewhere or pass credentials



18

00:00:51.799 --> 00:00:53.312

or something of a kind



19

00:00:53.312 --> 00:00:56.987

that is potentially dengerous and you should not do that



20

00:00:56.987 --> 00:01:00.229

I mean, quite literally you shouldn't do it



21

00:01:00.229 --> 00:01:03.524

The other option is to use some sort of VPNs



22

00:01:03.524 --> 00:01:11.617

and to encrypt your traffic betweten you and the VPN service provider.



23

00:01:11.617 --> 00:01:15.058

Now these things can be very fast, depenending on which one you have.



24

00:01:15.058 --> 00:01:16.798

So you can just pay for a service out there



25

00:01:16.798 --> 00:01:21.576

A yearly subscription is like a hundred and something bucks



26

00:01:21.576 --> 00:01:23.487

A monthly suscription is like ten bucks.



27

00:01:24.147 --> 00:01:27.853

You get a dedicated VPN static IP adress.



28

00:01:27.853 --> 00:01:30.756

So you can do a lot of stuff



29

00:01:30.756 --> 00:01:34.783

and they can be very very very fast.



30

00:01:34.783 --> 00:01:37.346

Furthermore your traffic is encrypted, as I said.



31

00:01:37.346 --> 00:01:42.075

and the only way that somebody can figure out that you are doing something somewhere



32

00:01:42.075 --> 00:01:47.762

is if the VPN service provider actually relinquishes your information.



33

00:01:48.462 --> 00:01:50.909

However this does not happen that often.



34

00:01:50.909 --> 00:01:56.751

This is very difficult to attain, especially if you get a VPN in certain parts of the world



35

00:01:56.751 --> 00:02:00.964

where they just generally don't give these sort of information out



36

00:02:00.964 --> 00:02:05.429

but I woudln't recommend doing that for white hat hacking



37

00:02:05.429 --> 00:02:09.085

primarily because they isn't need to stay anonymous to that extent.



38

00:02:09.085 --> 00:02:13.671

What we are going to be using VPN and proxies mainly for



39

00:02:13.671 --> 00:02:18.782

or what they are mainly used for in the world today, I would say anyway



40

00:02:18.782 --> 00:02:21.305

this is just my personal opinion



41

00:02:21.305 --> 00:02:27.257

is to bypass firewall settings or firewall limitations, should I say.



42

00:02:27.257 --> 00:02:29.753

So here's a real-life example



43

00:02:29.753 --> 00:02:34.104

that people are using pretty much on daily basis.



44

00:02:34.104 --> 00:02:40.816

Netflix, for example, has a certain range of IP adresses from which it allows connections.



45

00:02:40.816 --> 00:02:47.057

So if you are elsewhere in the world and you don not belong to that IP adress range



46

00:02:47.057 --> 00:02:50.729

it will not allow you to view anything on the site



47

00:02:50.729 --> 00:02:53.896

it will not allow you to see movies or something of a kind.



48

00:02:53.896 --> 00:02:55.503

However, if you use a proxy



49

00:02:55.503 --> 00:02:56.812

a good one



50

00:02:56.812 --> 00:02:58.394

or if you use a VPN



51

00:02:58.394 --> 00:03:02.367

you will be access to site as through you were coming from the country



52

00:03:02.367 --> 00:03:05.999

which falls within the IP adress range list



53

00:03:05.999 --> 00:03:09.181

So that's just one of the common examples, what people have been doing



54

00:03:09.181 --> 00:03:16.424

It's not exactly harmful or something like that.



55

00:03:16.424 --> 00:03:20.548

You're not taking servers down or anything of a kind



56

00:03:20.548 --> 00:03:25.065

but people have been using it in order to be able to watch Netflix from, I don't know



57

00:03:25.065 --> 00:03:28.512

from a cell phone when they're traveling or something like that



58

00:03:28.512 --> 00:03:31.920

In any case, there are numerous other examples



59

00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:34.142

when you want to bypass certain firewall settings.



60

00:03:34.142 --> 00:03:39.776

Primarily you bypass the IP range list which are allowed to access a certain server or something like that



61

00:03:39.776 --> 00:03:47.363

Also, for example, if you had a certain server who's traffic is mainly generated from these single area



62

00:03:47.363 --> 00:03:48.975

from a single country



63

00:03:48.975 --> 00:03:57.669

and you do not want to be, for example, scanning it from an IP address that belongs to the area in China



64

00:03:57.669 --> 00:04:03.174

or something like that, because those IP adresses look very differently.



65

00:04:03.174 --> 00:04:04.412

I mean, of course they're withing the same



66

00:04:04.412 --> 00:04:08.412

but any network administrator, as soon as they see that IP address of that kind



67

00:04:08.412 --> 00:04:11.771

that is far away from their geographical area



68

00:04:11.771 --> 00:04:18.843

they will know that it's an anomaly of some sort that doesn't belong there



69

00:04:18.843 --> 00:04:21.721

and they will be intrigued, they will start looking



70

00:04:21.721 --> 00:04:24.380

So that is not something you want happening to you.



71

00:04:24.380 --> 00:04:30.025

You want to be accessing the server from where all the other users are accessing it from



72

00:04:30.025 --> 00:04:33.877

in order to hide yourself in the mass.



73

00:04:33.877 --> 00:04:37.667

In any case, that is what we should be doing in this chapter



74

00:04:37.667 --> 00:04:40.844

and a few other things but for the time being, for this tutorial



75

00:04:40.844 --> 00:04:44.149

I want to show you how you can actually access the dark web



76

00:04:44.149 --> 00:04:47.428

or the hidden web, whichever way you wish to refer to it.



77

00:04:47.428 --> 00:04:52.786

Now the rumor is that the dark web is a lot bigger than your regular internet.



78

00:04:52.786 --> 00:04:56.812

There's a lot more information there



79

00:04:56.812 --> 00:04:58.705

and I use it's resources



80

00:04:58.705 --> 00:05:00.219

a lot of people do.



81

00:05:00.219 --> 00:05:03.184

There are some very nice forums where you can get a lot of good stuff.



82

00:05:03.184 --> 00:05:08.624

So I would definitely recommend trying it out



83

00:05:08.624 --> 00:05:10.456

and at some point in time, you will need it.



84

00:05:10.456 --> 00:05:13.318

For that, you will need to install a tor browser



85

00:05:13.318 --> 00:05:18.119

and with tor browser, you will be able to access dark net



86

00:05:18.119 --> 00:05:21.427

Now it's not installed by default on Kali



87

00:05:21.427 --> 00:05:26.932

and this is one of those rare occasions and rare situations



88

00:05:26.932 --> 00:05:31.983

where we will actually need a different user other than root



89

00:05:31.983 --> 00:05:34.926

in order to be able to do anything with tor



90

00:05:34.926 --> 00:05:36.341

in order to be able to start it.



91

00:05:36.341 --> 00:05:42.018

So first off, I'm going to go ahead and create a new user.



92

00:05:42.018 --> 00:05:43.999

So just open up your virtual machine.



93

00:05:43.999 --> 00:05:46.010

You see mine is already opened up here.



94

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:48.493

I'm just changing the size of it.



95

00:05:48.493 --> 00:05:49.806

You can see it's virtual machine



96

00:05:49.806 --> 00:05:52.027

and I have my terminal up and running here.



97

00:05:52.027 --> 00:05:53.799

I can close it and reopen it.



98

00:05:53.799 --> 00:05:54.879

There you go



99

00:05:54.879 --> 00:05:58.658

Just open up your tegular terminal and type in the following



100

00:05:58.658 --> 00:06:01.006

So first off, we need tor.



101

00:06:01.006 --> 00:06:03.593

I will explain what tor is in a moment



102

00:06:03.593 --> 00:06:11.468

but you just type in "apt - get install tor -y"



103

00:06:11.468 --> 00:06:13.387

and press ENTER



104

00:06:13.387 --> 00:06:16.254

With this command that I am highlighting at the moment



105

00:06:16.254 --> 00:06:18.329

tor will install, no problems in Kali



106

00:06:18.329 --> 00:06:21.262

as long as you have an active internet connection.



107

00:06:21.262 --> 00:06:27.643

It is not installing here because I already have it installed.



108

00:06:27.643 --> 00:06:32.410

Yep, there we go



109

00:06:32.410 --> 00:06:35.564

It says "tor is already the newest version"



110

00:06:35.564 --> 00:06:37.130

So it is already installed.



111

00:06:37.130 --> 00:06:38.247

It is the newest version.



112

00:06:38.247 --> 00:06:41.395

I have deliberately skipped all the entire verbose installation



113

00:06:41.395 --> 00:06:46.446

primarily because you're not going to see anything useful at the moment



114

00:06:46.446 --> 00:06:49.129

and it's gonna waste quite a bit of time.



115

00:06:49.129 --> 00:06:51.415

So just type in this command.



116

00:06:51.415 --> 00:06:55.435

You will not be prompted for any question for any questions because of the -y argument



117

00:06:55.435 --> 00:06:59.229

and installation will go through, no problems.



118

00:06:59.229 --> 00:07:01.653

Let me just go ahead and clear the screen.



119

00:07:01.653 --> 00:07:07.878

Now the next things that we need to do is actually create that user that I have been talking about.



120

00:07:07.878 --> 00:07:12.124

So just go ahead and type in the command "adduser"



121

00:07:12.124 --> 00:07:16.412

Just the keynote here -- There was also a command "useradd"



122

00:07:16.412 --> 00:07:19.249

Do not use this command for the time being



123

00:07:19.249 --> 00:07:23.038

primarily because I have discovered that it causes some unnecessary complications



124

00:07:23.038 --> 00:07:25.982

which tend to hinder us along the way



125

00:07:25.982 --> 00:07:30.908

Just go ahead and type "adduser"



126

00:07:30.908 --> 00:07:34.790

and now you can name your user whatever you want.



127

00:07:34.790 --> 00:07:37.216

You cannot use capital letters, if I remember correctly.



128

00:07:37.216 --> 00:07:39.014

That is the rule in debian systems.



129

00:07:39.014 --> 00:07:47.263

So I'm just gonna call my user "test"



130

00:07:47.263 --> 00:07:51.349

My user will be test



131

00:07:51.349 --> 00:07:52.338

and there we go



132

00:07:52.338 --> 00:07:56.714

Now it says "adding user test", "adding new group test"



133

00:07:56.714 --> 00:08:00.063

"adding new user test", "adding new user test with group test"



134

00:08:00.063 --> 00:08:02.368

That's pretty much what has happened here.



135

00:08:02.368 --> 00:08:05.344

It has created a home directory for that user.



136

00:08:05.344 --> 00:08:07.121

It already exists



137

00:08:07.121 --> 00:08:09.259

Letting you know I have created previously



138

00:08:09.259 --> 00:08:13.338

but I have deleted it, just to make sure there are no mistakes in this tutorial



139

00:08:13.338 --> 00:08:14.741

but it doesn't matter



140

00:08:14.741 --> 00:08:19.934

It will say here that the home test directory has been created



141

00:08:19.934 --> 00:08:23.220

and that you will be able to use it.



142

00:08:23.220 --> 00:08:26.435

You do need this folder, primarily because we're going to be doing stuff there.



143

00:08:26.435 --> 00:08:30.194

which you cannot do with root.



144

00:08:30.194 --> 00:08:32.723

Go ahead and type in your password here.



145

00:08:32.723 --> 00:08:35.264

It doesn't show anything when you type.



146

00:08:35.264 --> 00:08:37.943

That's the standard way of Unix passwords



147

00:08:37.943 --> 00:08:41.682

in order to prevent anybody from seen the length of the password in the screen.



148

00:08:41.682 --> 00:08:42.823

Very nice



149

00:08:42.823 --> 00:08:44.019

So press Enter



150

00:08:44.019 --> 00:08:49.746

Now you are prompted here for some information in regards to that user



151

00:08:49.746 --> 00:08:52.480

Completely irrelevant for our porpouse today.



152

00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.746

So we do not want to type in full name, room number



153

00:08:54.746 --> 00:08:57.161

work phone, home phone, other



154

00:08:57.161 --> 00:08:58.768

Don't care



155

00:08:58.768 --> 00:09:00.961

Is this information correct? Sure, why not?



156

00:09:00.961 --> 00:09:02.686

Press Enter, and there we go



157

00:09:02.686 --> 00:09:09.292

We have just effectively created our new user test, to which we need to log



158

00:09:09.292 --> 00:09:11.138

and then from there, conduct our work.



159

00:09:11.138 --> 00:09:19.806

Now a key thing to note here is that, even though there is a way of configuring the tor browser to run as root



160

00:09:19.806 --> 00:09:21.522

it's not simple, but there is a way



161

00:09:21.522 --> 00:09:24.073

do not do that.



162

00:09:24.073 --> 00:09:28.951

I mean, it's not even good idea to browse the internet as root user.



163

00:09:28.951 --> 00:09:34.693

If you pick any sort of viruses up, any sort of maliciuos code,



164

00:09:34.693 --> 00:09:36.641

it's going to run as root.



165

00:09:36.641 --> 00:09:38.599

So you don't want that on your system



166

00:09:38.599 --> 00:09:41.306

You do not want to compromise it in such a way



167

00:09:41.306 --> 00:09:45.027

and generally, on the machine that you re performing these tasks



168

00:09:45.027 --> 00:09:46.908

like this virtual machine of Kali Linux



169

00:09:46.908 --> 00:09:48.951

you don't really use it to browse the internet.



170

00:09:48.951 --> 00:09:55.059

For the sake of examples, I sometimes open the browser Firefox basically



171

00:09:55.059 --> 00:09:59.093

and do some stuff there, just to show you the information



172

00:09:59.093 --> 00:10:04.790

or, as you've seen now, I have downloaded, I have downloaded from a very specific site...



173

00:10:04.790 --> 00:10:08.221

actually not now, but in a few moments you will



174

00:10:08.221 --> 00:10:11.829

I will download from a very specific site a tor browser.



175

00:10:11.829 --> 00:10:16.828

So just when you know exactly what you're doing and where are you getting it from



176

00:10:16.828 --> 00:10:20.260

and when you have verficiation of the source



177

00:10:20.260 --> 00:10:24.272

then you should use it as root, or you can use it as root



178

00:10:24.272 --> 00:10:28.306

but otherwise, do not browse the internet as a root user.



179

00:10:28.306 --> 00:10:30.451

That's a bad idea.



180

00:10:30.451 --> 00:10:36.331

However, we will mainly use this user for our tor browser



181

00:10:36.331 --> 00:10:39.221

otherwise, we'll be using the root user



182

00:10:39.221 --> 00:10:42.831

primarily because you can do pretty much anything in Kali without the root user.



183

00:10:42.831 --> 00:10:46.916

All the tools, more or less, require these sort of root permissions.



184

00:10:46.916 --> 00:10:51.709

as they do tend to access network related things.



185

00:10:51.709 --> 00:10:58.394

Anyway, I will cut the tutorial here and I'll see you in the second part of it.
