00:00:00.550 --> 00:00:05.250

Welcome back everybody. Let's go ahead and

go through this installation process and see



2

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:13.210

how this actually works. So I cannot I can't

actually increase the screen size here. Hopefully



3

00:00:13.210 --> 00:00:19.460

you can see everything. I can see from quite

some distance away, so hopefully you can as



4

00:00:19.460 --> 00:00:25.359

well. I'll just go ahead and begin the installation

process. First of all, we have an option for



5

00:00:25.359 --> 00:00:29.789

Kali live. We don't care about the live at

the moment. I've shown you how to use the



6

00:00:29.789 --> 00:00:37.070

live before. We're just going to select the

install. Press enter and it will go through.



7

00:00:37.070 --> 00:00:41.690

Okay, the mouse pointer integration and all

that is not functional at the moment. The



8

00:00:41.690 --> 00:00:49.800

release key is right control as you can see.

I'm in in the text mode only now, so I can't



9

00:00:49.800 --> 00:00:53.559

really choose that. But once installation

is complete, the release key for the mouse



10

00:00:53.559 --> 00:01:01.359

will be the right control. Okay, so select

your language here. I'll go ahead and select



11

00:01:01.359 --> 00:01:08.300

English and select UK. Select appropriately

for yourselves whatever you wish. These are



12

00:01:08.300 --> 00:01:15.280

only my preferences, you can select any that

are offered here. Feel free to do so. Okay,



13

00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:20.800

so the installation process is going through.

It shouldn't take too long. Well, this is



14

00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:26.200

not the installation process. This is loading

all the other things. Installation will begin



15

00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:37.590

shortly, once we have configured all the parameters.

Okay, it's going through. Come on. Network



16

00:01:37.590 --> 00:01:48.840

successful, hostname. Which will be to hostname,

I don't know. My Fedora is called cup of tea.



17

00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:59.070

Let's call this one cup of coffee. You can

change this later if you wish. domain name--



18

00:01:59.070 --> 00:02:04.180

I don't really care about this, just go through

it. Root password: Now, please. I've noticed



19

00:02:04.180 --> 00:02:09.110

a lot of people forget their root passwords

when they type them in here. Type in the root



20

00:02:09.110 --> 00:02:14.170

password. I'm just going ahead and typing

in "test" because this is a virtual machine,



21

00:02:14.170 --> 00:02:19.140

and I'm just doing the installation for testing

purposes. I just typed in test, but you can



22

00:02:19.140 --> 00:02:26.490

type in whatever you want. Please be sure

to remember this. Press continue again. Retype



23

00:02:26.490 --> 00:02:32.920

your password to confirm it. It doesn't give

me any warnings, even though the password



24

00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:36.390

is way too short. We can of course change

this later, but for the time being, please



25

00:02:36.390 --> 00:02:42.040

be sure to remember. So, guided use entire

disk select for this. There is only one that



26

00:02:42.040 --> 00:02:46.950

we have assigned to this virtual machine.

All files in one partition, recommended for



27

00:02:46.950 --> 00:02:52.280

new users. Sure, why not. Finish partitioning

and write changes to disk. Write changes to



28

00:02:52.280 --> 00:03:01.500

disk, yes. There we go. So, no big deal. Now,

the installation has commenced. This is going



29

00:03:01.500 --> 00:03:10.390

to take a while. It may ask a few questions

along the way. No big deal. Usually there



30

00:03:10.390 --> 00:03:15.790

will be a default option which you can select

and that's going to be good enough. If there



31

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:22.000

is anything of significance, I will take some

screenshots and inform you of the changes



32

00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:28.630

that I have chosen. For the time being I'm

going to pause the tutorial here. I'm not



33

00:03:28.630 --> 00:03:32.830

going to make another one. I'm just going

to pause here. I'll continue within this one



34

00:03:32.830 --> 00:03:41.060

when the installation is complete. That way

you don't have to sit here for like 10-15



35

00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:47.990

minutes or more waiting for this thing to

complete. Okay, so installation is going.



36

00:03:47.990 --> 00:03:53.680

This is the first question that I was asked:

use a network mirror? Yes. HTPP proxy information--



37

00:03:53.680 --> 00:04:00.540

I don't really need it. I'm not going through

a proxy server. Just just select continue.



38

00:04:00.540 --> 00:04:08.209

It's scanning the mirror. It is just gonna

go forward and retrieve some files, etc. Anyway,



39

00:04:08.209 --> 00:04:17.269

we're going pause until the next problem.

Okay, so the next the next question is: the



40

00:04:17.269 --> 00:04:24.509

grub boot loader a hard disk. Sure, why not.

Just go ahead and install it. Then, select



41

00:04:24.509 --> 00:04:29.620

select this device. This is the only one that

you have on the VirtualBox so it's fine. Go



42

00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:39.289

ahead and select it. Now the procedure will

just continue. Okay, so it was just a question



43

00:04:39.289 --> 00:04:44.090

to actually go ahead and reboot the machine

and finish of the installation. All you need



44

00:04:44.090 --> 00:04:54.759

to do is click on continue. Okay, so now we

are prompted here with this screen after the



45

00:04:54.759 --> 00:05:02.639

reboot. Just go ahead and type in root, enter.

Now, type in the password. Enter. There you



46

00:05:02.639 --> 00:05:13.509

go. The machine will boot. It might take a

bit of time. It is first the first boot, so



47

00:05:13.509 --> 00:05:22.839

be considerate and kind. That will be it.

That is the Kali VirtualBox machine. Next



48

00:05:22.839 --> 00:05:28.650

up, the what we shall do is install guest

additions in order to make it functional.



49

00:05:28.650 --> 00:05:35.689

Anyway, we are going to do that in the next

tutorial, as a separate part. Until then,



50

00:05:35.689 --> 00:05:37.539

I bid you all farewell.
