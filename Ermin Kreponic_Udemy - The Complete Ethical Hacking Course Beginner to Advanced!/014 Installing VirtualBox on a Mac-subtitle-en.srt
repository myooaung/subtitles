1
00:00:00,300 --> 00:00:02,471
Welcome all.

2
00:00:03,706 --> 00:00:07,155
Today I have some joyous news for everyone,

3
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:10,348
well, not for everyone,
but ok, for a lot of people, I guess.

4
00:00:10,883 --> 00:00:14,238
Due to popular demand on Udemy I have

5
00:00:17,934 --> 00:00:22,973
for Mac, for Mac
instructions, for tutorials on a Mac,

6
00:00:23,408 --> 00:00:28,515
I have decided to acquire a
MacBook Pro to do the demonstrations on it.

7
00:00:29,150 --> 00:00:32,544
The set up instructions
on how to install VirtualBox,

8
00:00:32,579 --> 00:00:34,104
how to do a passthrough

9
00:00:34,914 --> 00:00:38,247
and pretty much anything else
that you might ask of me to do.

10
00:00:38,282 --> 00:00:40,619
I will be happy to do it if I can.

11
00:00:42,179 --> 00:00:46,151
And also, for some of the
problems that people have been experiencing

12
00:00:46,286 --> 00:00:51,169
on a Mac, now I can relate to you.
Now you can write me and I can attempt

13
00:00:51,404 --> 00:00:53,561
to recreate the problems and find the solutions.

14
00:00:55,163 --> 00:00:58,399
But before I actually
begin with the tutorial itself,

15
00:00:58,434 --> 00:01:04,036
I would like to share
my experience this far with a Mac.

16
00:01:05,066 --> 00:01:07,309
This is something I really feel that I need to do.

17
00:01:07,650 --> 00:01:13,116
First of all, the price.
When I saw what the prices were for Macs

18
00:01:13,151 --> 00:01:17,177
that was pretty detrimental and demoralizing

19
00:01:17,212 --> 00:01:21,102
with me going around and looking for a used Mac.

20
00:01:22,922 --> 00:01:27,246
But, I guess it needed to be done, so here it is.

21
00:01:27,481 --> 00:01:32,933
What I've acquired to
purchase is a MacBook Pro, from late 2011

22
00:01:33,068 --> 00:01:36,491
with a 2.4 GHz i7 Quad-core processor

23
00:01:36,826 --> 00:01:42,610
and with 4GB of RAM and with
8 dedicated to AMD graphics card.

24
00:01:44,085 --> 00:01:49,400
So I have replaced the RAM,
I went to the official Mac service here

25
00:01:50,295 --> 00:01:53,667
and I asked them about
the RAM in Mac, and they basically said

26
00:01:53,802 --> 00:01:57,382
that I could either insert one 8GB slot

27
00:01:57,617 --> 00:02:00,915
and that would work
in conjuntion with my 2GB slot,

28
00:02:01,050 --> 00:02:02,654
which was on a lower frequency,

29
00:02:02,689 --> 00:02:05,119
but then both would work in a lower frequency,

30
00:02:05,154 --> 00:02:06,913
or I could insert two of them.

31
00:02:06,948 --> 00:02:10,852
Upon realizing what the price
was for two, I promptly instructed him

32
00:02:11,087 --> 00:02:15,171
to insert only one into
this Mac, as I don't really need

33
00:02:15,206 --> 00:02:20,084
more than 10GB of RAM,
however the frequency is a bit lower.

34
00:02:20,119 --> 00:02:23,609
Anyway, that is the hardware that I have,

35
00:02:23,744 --> 00:02:28,412
so that you know what
I am working with, so that you can compare

36
00:02:28,447 --> 00:02:31,995
to your own and understand
my limitations, if there are any.

37
00:02:32,130 --> 00:02:37,281
And I also have the latest
update of Yosemite installed here.

38
00:02:38,386 --> 00:02:41,669
And I have created a dedicated account for Udemy,

39
00:02:41,804 --> 00:02:45,326
as you can see, in the
upper right corner it says Udemy.

40
00:02:45,961 --> 00:02:51,465
I have not installed
anything with this account, so

41
00:02:52,232 --> 00:02:53,977
this is as it gets, this is stock.

42
00:02:56,901 --> 00:02:58,970
And now I will go through the tutorials

43
00:02:59,005 --> 00:03:01,492
and show you how to install VirtualBox, Kali

44
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:04,741
and passthrough, set up a passthrough, I mean

45
00:03:04,976 --> 00:03:09,331
things are fairly the same, if not exactly the same

46
00:03:09,666 --> 00:03:12,295
but some people have been
experiencing some problems.

47
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:14,401
I have not done anything on this Mac,

48
00:03:14,436 --> 00:03:19,340
I have not done any installations
or anything like that, so I want to see

49
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:22,721
if I will encounter the same
problems while instructing you

50
00:03:22,756 --> 00:03:26,030
and let's see how,
if I am able to resolve them quickly.

51
00:03:26,065 --> 00:03:28,649
If I'm able to resolve them
quickly, I'll leave it in this tutorial.

52
00:03:28,684 --> 00:03:32,168
If I'm not, I'll cut out the long
parts and see what I can do.

53
00:03:33,299 --> 00:03:38,030
Anyway, my experience this far with Yosemite,

54
00:03:38,365 --> 00:03:42,701
well, I'm not too thrilled
with it, not too enthusiastic.

55
00:03:42,836 --> 00:03:46,929
I mean, the design is nice,
both, the MacBook Pro design is very nice

56
00:03:47,064 --> 00:03:49,743
and the layout of the
operating system is very nice

57
00:03:49,978 --> 00:03:53,387
but it doesn't have the amount of customizability

58
00:03:53,422 --> 00:03:57,392
and it doesn't have the amount
of options that I have with Fedora, really.

59
00:03:57,427 --> 00:03:59,599
I don't have the same amount of freedom.

60
00:03:59,734 --> 00:04:02,900
But it is true what they say.
Things just tend to work with Mac.

61
00:04:02,935 --> 00:04:04,497
There are no problems of whatsoever.

62
00:04:06,849 --> 00:04:09,276
It runs smoothly, the battery's great and all that

63
00:04:09,311 --> 00:04:12,638
but I just don't have the
same features that I have on Linux,

64
00:04:12,673 --> 00:04:15,824
even though the terminal
commands are fairly similar,

65
00:04:16,988 --> 00:04:20,259
I don't have the same amount
of freedom to mess around with my system

66
00:04:20,294 --> 00:04:24,506
as I do have in Linux,
so that's one of the reasons why

67
00:04:24,541 --> 00:04:28,318
I didn't enjoy my
experience with a Mac that much, but

68
00:04:28,453 --> 00:04:31,844
I mean, it's ok, it's fine,
this is a perfectly legit operating system.

69
00:04:35,638 --> 00:04:37,151
I would definitely be able to use it,

70
00:04:38,052 --> 00:04:40,926
I do not think it would be a bad experience,

71
00:04:41,261 --> 00:04:43,953
on the contrary, I believe
it would be a fantastic experience,

72
00:04:44,253 --> 00:04:47,658
but I'm not switching from Linux, like, no way.

73
00:04:51,034 --> 00:04:53,590
So let's go ahead and begin with the basics.

74
00:04:53,625 --> 00:04:56,932
The first thing you
need to do if you are a Mac user

75
00:04:57,267 --> 00:05:01,707
to follow through this
tutorial, you will need to install

76
00:05:01,742 --> 00:05:05,600
a virtual machine of
Kali Linux, or create a dual boot.

77
00:05:06,743 --> 00:05:11,039
Today I'm not going to
demonstrate how to do a dual boot for Kali, but

78
00:05:12,403 --> 00:05:15,380
dual boot with Kali, I wouldn't really recommend

79
00:05:15,556 --> 00:05:17,337
because there isn't that much point to it,

80
00:05:17,433 --> 00:05:19,866
it's a lot easier to install a VirtualBox,

81
00:05:20,101 --> 00:05:23,268
as most of the wireless cards in Macs

82
00:05:23,403 --> 00:05:25,851
won't really be good for packet injection.

83
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:30,346
You might ask me what is the difference.

84
00:05:30,481 --> 00:05:32,230
Can we do packet injection with VirtualBox

85
00:05:32,265 --> 00:05:34,966
and stuff will go through
a virtual machine with VirtualBox?

86
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,755
No, you cannot do that.

87
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:39,981
Because if we install
a virtual machine, that virtual machine

88
00:05:40,016 --> 00:05:42,939
does not have access
to your integrated wireless card,

89
00:05:42,974 --> 00:05:47,078
the only thing you can do
is pass a USB wireless adapter

90
00:05:47,113 --> 00:05:49,745
to that virtual machine
and then do it a packet injection.

91
00:05:49,780 --> 00:05:52,514
This, I do believe that I shall demonstrate as well.

92
00:05:54,256 --> 00:05:57,504
Our work around for this
in most laptops, including MacBooks

93
00:05:57,639 --> 00:06:02,304
is simply to create a
dual boot, or a live boot, and then...

94
00:06:03,912 --> 00:06:06,551
A live boot is basically to create a USB of Kali.

95
00:06:07,510 --> 00:06:09,059
There is a separate tutorial for that.

96
00:06:11,785 --> 00:06:15,766
Those two options remain
and you can access your hardware directly.

97
00:06:16,001 --> 00:06:18,779
But then again, there is no point in doing that

98
00:06:18,814 --> 00:06:22,469
if your wireless card
does not support packet injection

99
00:06:22,504 --> 00:06:25,048
or it's simply not good for it.

100
00:06:25,083 --> 00:06:29,000
So I would advise you to get a wireless adapter

101
00:06:29,235 --> 00:06:33,364
and if you still want
to attempt a dual boot or live version

102
00:06:33,399 --> 00:06:35,375
I mean, by all means, feel free to do so

103
00:06:35,410 --> 00:06:39,323
and I really, really,
really hope that it does work out.

104
00:06:39,358 --> 00:06:43,828
But in this tutorial I will
show you how to install VirtualBox.

105
00:06:43,863 --> 00:06:47,055
Also, by the way, if you have any other request

106
00:06:47,090 --> 00:06:51,063
what you'd like me to demonstrate
on a Mac, feel free to ask it of me,

107
00:06:51,398 --> 00:06:54,348
but I'm only going to go in terms of configuration

108
00:06:54,383 --> 00:06:57,794
if you want the stuff
on the course that I do in Linux

109
00:06:57,829 --> 00:06:59,550
and you want to do the same things on a Mac,

110
00:07:01,420 --> 00:07:04,224
that's not a good idea,
let me just leave it to that.

111
00:07:06,451 --> 00:07:08,296
Let me just go ahead and begin with this already

112
00:07:08,331 --> 00:07:12,484
because I'm looking at my timer,
I've been bubbling for about 7 minutes.

113
00:07:15,703 --> 00:07:18,525
So let's open up the default web browser,

114
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:20,950
I'm not going to install
Firefox or anything like that.

115
00:07:21,085 --> 00:07:23,385
On my main user I have
installed Firefox so I can use it,

116
00:07:23,720 --> 00:07:26,950
but as I said I'm running this at stock.

117
00:07:27,685 --> 00:07:31,790
I've no intention of
changing the default installation.

118
00:07:32,984 --> 00:07:35,265
Let's go ahead and first
open up the VirtualBox website.

119
00:07:37,935 --> 00:07:42,551
Type in "virtualbox" and search for it.

120
00:07:44,901 --> 00:07:48,517
We've got https://www.virtualbox.org.

121
00:07:54,050 --> 00:07:56,397
There we go, so check if it's secured.

122
00:07:56,632 --> 00:07:58,561
Safari is using an encrypted connection.

123
00:08:02,223 --> 00:08:03,816
Show the certificates.

124
00:08:07,866 --> 00:08:10,679
Issued by VeriSign, ok so I know they're the ones

125
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:13,912
issuing the certificate
for this site, so that is fine.

126
00:08:15,070 --> 00:08:16,837
You go ahead an check the certificate anyway

127
00:08:17,072 --> 00:08:21,221
and make sure that it's https, just in case

128
00:08:21,256 --> 00:08:24,313
because people tend to put fake webs, websites,

129
00:08:24,348 --> 00:08:28,333
quite a good amount of times.
And then go into Downloads

130
00:08:30,995 --> 00:08:32,938
And from the downloads you can see...

131
00:08:34,598 --> 00:08:36,469
Oh, I didn't configure this bar down.

132
00:08:36,804 --> 00:08:39,246
Let's go ahead and configure this bar.

133
00:08:39,281 --> 00:08:41,020
I'm sorry, it's just gonna take a minute.

134
00:08:41,155 --> 00:08:44,814
The Dock. I'm pretty sure
all the Mac users know how to do this.

135
00:08:47,044 --> 00:08:49,316
Hide it. Thank you.

136
00:08:51,091 --> 00:08:54,180
Now let's expand this.
I really like this feature with a Mac

137
00:08:54,215 --> 00:08:58,199
that you can slide left and right, with 3 fingers.

138
00:09:00,095 --> 00:09:05,014
Let's go ahead and select
the OS X version of VirtualBox.

139
00:09:05,149 --> 00:09:08,715
So we got VirtualBox for
Windows hosts, OS X hosts.

140
00:09:08,750 --> 00:09:11,707
Let's go ahead and select that one.

141
00:09:12,622 --> 00:09:15,337
The download is proceeding.

142
00:09:19,226 --> 00:09:23,001
And it's going pretty fast.
For me, anyway. Or so I like to think.

143
00:09:24,403 --> 00:09:27,273
And I don't have the fastest
internet connection out there,

144
00:09:27,608 --> 00:09:31,932
it's 8MB down and 10Mb up,

145
00:09:32,267 --> 00:09:36,991
80Mb down and 10Mb up,
but it does serve its purpose.

146
00:09:39,116 --> 00:09:41,631
Let's go ahead and open up this file.

147
00:09:46,312 --> 00:09:50,120
Let it run, let it run.
No big deal. Shouldn't take too long.

148
00:09:50,555 --> 00:09:53,890
Checking volumes. Finishing. Thank you.

149
00:09:56,575 --> 00:09:59,894
So let's go ahead and begin with the installation.

150
00:10:00,029 --> 00:10:03,463
This is the first time I'm
actually installing something in a Mac,

151
00:10:04,526 --> 00:10:06,136
I've done this deliberately.

152
00:10:06,571 --> 00:10:10,016
I did not want to do
this installation prior to this

153
00:10:10,251 --> 00:10:12,732
so that I can put myself into somebody's shoes

154
00:10:13,067 --> 00:10:16,569
and that I would encounter the same exact problems

155
00:10:16,804 --> 00:10:19,254
that you yourselves would encounter,

156
00:10:19,289 --> 00:10:22,763
I am hoping that I will
encounter them to an extent, anyway.

157
00:10:26,827 --> 00:10:28,754
Let's go ahead and see what it says.

158
00:10:28,789 --> 00:10:31,930
"Double click on this icon". Nevermind that.

159
00:10:31,965 --> 00:10:33,683
"Run the VirtualBox application..."

160
00:10:37,246 --> 00:10:40,349
Will this work? No. Yes. Excellent.

161
00:10:42,966 --> 00:10:45,847
I'm lying. In my user
installation I did install Firefox

162
00:10:45,982 --> 00:10:49,593
so that's something. But I
did not install VirtualBox prior to this.

163
00:10:52,142 --> 00:10:53,949
Let's go ahead and open up Applications.

164
00:11:01,568 --> 00:11:04,152
There we go. VirtualBox package.

165
00:11:07,191 --> 00:11:09,461
"This package will run a program to determine

166
00:11:09,496 --> 00:11:12,808
if the software can be installed". OK.

167
00:11:15,124 --> 00:11:18,718
Introduction. Thank you for the introduction.

168
00:11:18,753 --> 00:11:22,163
Change install location.
What is the default install location?

169
00:11:23,374 --> 00:11:25,121
Install only for me.

170
00:11:29,555 --> 00:11:31,499
Why doesn't it give this option?

171
00:11:37,774 --> 00:11:39,467
Maybe it's stuck or something.

172
00:11:42,676 --> 00:11:44,745
No, it's definitely not stuck.

173
00:11:49,114 --> 00:11:50,845
That's just a certificate.

174
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,757
Install for all users on this computer.
I do not know how to change this.

175
00:11:56,892 --> 00:11:59,349
Apparently I don't have the ability to change it.

176
00:12:03,435 --> 00:12:05,215
Customize. Let's see what this does.

177
00:12:08,083 --> 00:12:12,619
The command line tools, maybe I shall use them.

178
00:12:12,854 --> 00:12:16,909
The utilities, not a bad idea.
VirtualBox kernel extensions.

179
00:12:18,452 --> 00:12:23,258
It seems to have everything
prepackaged here. That is very nice.

180
00:12:23,593 --> 00:12:27,461
I could actually disable
one package, but it doesn't allow me

181
00:12:27,596 --> 00:12:29,936
to go ahead and destroy the kernel extensions.

182
00:12:29,971 --> 00:12:32,908
But it's OK, I mean, there I needed for it to work.

183
00:12:39,456 --> 00:12:42,728
What I am bothered with the most,
and sure somebody's looking at me

184
00:12:44,074 --> 00:12:46,886
and saying "wow, what a stupid person you are",

185
00:12:46,921 --> 00:12:49,968
"you can't even change the destination".

186
00:12:57,571 --> 00:13:00,416
I suppose it has to install for everybody,

187
00:13:01,354 --> 00:13:03,617
that seems a bit strange, doesn't it?

188
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:07,271
Well, not really a big deal. To be honest,

189
00:13:07,306 --> 00:13:10,176
I kind of need VirtualBox
in my other users as well.

190
00:13:12,980 --> 00:13:15,401
On my main user I need the VirtualBox as well,

191
00:13:15,436 --> 00:13:16,939
I was meaning to install it anyway.

192
00:13:17,890 --> 00:13:19,957
So let's go ahead and skip that shameful part

193
00:13:20,092 --> 00:13:22,501
where the instructor knows nothing.

194
00:13:24,791 --> 00:13:27,476
It's requesting me that
I confirm this with a password,

195
00:13:27,711 --> 00:13:32,899
so let's go ahead and type it in. There we go.

196
00:13:33,879 --> 00:13:37,659
The strange thing for me,
coming to a Mac is that I can

197
00:13:37,894 --> 00:13:42,265
I mean, there is like the Homebrew,
the packet manager that I can install

198
00:13:44,285 --> 00:13:49,284
for OS X, but it is very
annoying to actually have to install that

199
00:13:49,419 --> 00:13:52,230
and not have a packet manager by default.

200
00:13:52,565 --> 00:13:54,856
So I have 30 minutes remaining.

201
00:13:55,852 --> 00:13:58,406
Hopefully we can finish it, as I am running short,

202
00:13:58,441 --> 00:14:01,007
as I only have six more minutes of the tutorial

203
00:14:02,125 --> 00:14:03,770
due to the limitations on Udemy.

204
00:14:04,005 --> 00:14:07,843
So that is the installation
procedure for VirtualBox.

205
00:14:07,878 --> 00:14:09,436
It seems to be installed now.

206
00:14:10,830 --> 00:14:16,689
Let's go ahead and run it,
and I probably don't need this anymore.

207
00:14:21,576 --> 00:14:23,120
Is this how you delete things?

208
00:14:23,155 --> 00:14:25,245
No, that's how you remove them from the dock.

209
00:14:26,663 --> 00:14:29,900
I'll just use the file manager to remove it.

210
00:14:29,935 --> 00:14:32,358
Can I use the file manager to remove it?

211
00:14:46,160 --> 00:14:49,342
Excellent, so there we go.
Let's go into the applications.

212
00:14:52,452 --> 00:14:54,033
And move to trash.

213
00:14:55,273 --> 00:14:57,396
Now we're gonna go ahead and start VirtualBox.

214
00:14:59,626 --> 00:15:02,907
I don't have an SSD in this, so keep that in mind.

215
00:15:04,182 --> 00:15:07,199
The version with an SSD was kind of expensive.

216
00:15:08,627 --> 00:15:13,971
But I might decide to upgrade
later on if it's worth the while.

217
00:15:15,002 --> 00:15:18,388
Probably it is in terms of speed,
but again, I don't use this laptop

218
00:15:18,423 --> 00:15:20,524
for much other than web browsing.

219
00:15:21,676 --> 00:15:26,843
Let's go ahead and, now that we have this set up,

220
00:15:26,878 --> 00:15:28,576
now we're gonna go ahead and

221
00:15:29,907 --> 00:15:31,536
basically just download Kali

222
00:15:31,771 --> 00:15:34,060
and in the next
tutorial we're going to install it.

223
00:15:35,135 --> 00:15:38,855
So go to Safari and then type in just Kali.

224
00:15:40,374 --> 00:15:41,919
It should pop up the right one.

225
00:15:43,013 --> 00:15:48,108
Https. Change to English. Thank you.

226
00:15:49,586 --> 00:15:53,304
There we go, the first one
is Kali Linux, Penetration Testing, https.

227
00:15:56,225 --> 00:15:58,150
We're gonna go into Downloads.

228
00:16:00,291 --> 00:16:04,364
And keep in mind that you can
either download a Kali 2.0 image from here

229
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:08,701
in different sections of the
instructions. I used different versions.

230
00:16:08,836 --> 00:16:11,116
I've updated certain sections of the tutorial

231
00:16:11,251 --> 00:16:13,249
which are considered to be vital.

232
00:16:16,090 --> 00:16:18,777
When you watch this,
if there is a newer version of Kali

233
00:16:18,812 --> 00:16:21,919
just go ahead and download it,
it should be fine, no problems.

234
00:16:21,954 --> 00:16:26,938
So you can either download
this one, the ISO file from here

235
00:16:27,173 --> 00:16:29,945
or you can go ahead and...

236
00:16:38,013 --> 00:16:42,729
There we go. So you can either
download the ISO file from here, this one

237
00:16:43,164 --> 00:16:48,959
or you can go down below and select Official ARM

238
00:16:49,094 --> 00:16:51,431
and VMWare images for virtual machines.

239
00:16:52,710 --> 00:16:57,300
So you have prebuild Kali Linux VMware images

240
00:16:57,435 --> 00:17:01,331
and you have prebuild
Kali Linux VirtualBox images.

241
00:17:01,466 --> 00:17:04,692
So you can use these as well. Keep that in mind.

242
00:17:08,226 --> 00:17:12,619
For the time being,
I would like you to go ahead and download

243
00:17:12,854 --> 00:17:18,145
this prebuild version, Kali Linux 64 bit VBox.

244
00:17:18,380 --> 00:17:20,861
And we're just gonna go ahead and click on...

245
00:17:21,196 --> 00:17:24,178
Do I have any torrent clients installed here?

246
00:17:26,825 --> 00:17:30,926
Are you serious? I do. No, this is just the image,

247
00:17:31,261 --> 00:17:33,680
this is just the file that starts the download.

248
00:17:36,247 --> 00:17:38,874
Any chance I have it installed?

249
00:17:40,978 --> 00:17:42,555
Of course not!

250
00:17:43,628 --> 00:17:47,984
So let's just go ahead and click
on the image and download it so

251
00:17:49,248 --> 00:17:52,099
download is proceeding. By the time I come back

252
00:17:52,134 --> 00:17:55,276
in the next tutorial the download will finish

253
00:17:55,311 --> 00:17:58,236
and I'll be able to show you how to install it

254
00:17:58,371 --> 00:18:02,195
and then we can go into USB passthrough on a Mac.

255
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:05,377
Until then, I bid you farewell.

256
00:18:05,412 --> 00:18:07,916
And I sincerely hope
that you are all pleased with this.
