1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,200
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,000
I will just continue from where I left off in the previous one.

3
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:09,400
So I have a live capture here in progress.

4
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:11,500
I'm just gonna go ahead and cancel it

5
00:00:11,500 --> 00:00:15,000
and now I will take from it what I need.

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,200
So the next command that we're gonna use again is "airodump-ng'

7
00:00:19,200 --> 00:00:22,000
but we will use it in combination with a few more arguments

8
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:27,600
in order to conduct a more precise capture

9
00:00:27,600 --> 00:00:31,000
so that we may achieve that four-way handshake

10
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:35,000
which we need so desperately in order to do this.

11
00:00:35,000 --> 00:00:40,400
So go ahead and type in here "airodump"

12
00:00:40,400 --> 00:00:42,000
but if you don't know the exact command

13
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:44,000
you don't need to memorize it.

14
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,000
Just do what I did

15
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,200
Type in "air", and then press tab twice fast.

16
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:53,500
If it doesn't work twice, press it thrice

17
00:00:53,500 --> 00:00:55,000
how ever many times you need it.

18
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:56,500
Just press it really fast

19
00:00:56,500 --> 00:00:59,410
and then the terminal will actually tell you what you were possibilities are.

20
00:00:59,410 --> 00:01:02,200
What we need is airodump

21
00:01:02,200 --> 00:01:04,000
and this is the command that we need.

22
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,500
So just go ahead and type in "airo" and tab it again.

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,600
It will give you fewer options

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:11,000
"airodump-ng"

25
00:01:11,000 --> 00:01:12,300
That's it

26
00:01:12,300 --> 00:01:15,300
One of the first things that we're going to do is specify a channel.

27
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:18,400
The channel on which my wireless is functioning at the moment.

28
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,000
I have configured for this particular exercise is channel 6.

29
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:24,570
So channel 6

30
00:01:24,570 --> 00:01:26,700
and what is the BSSID?

31
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,500
This is the BSSID

32
00:01:28,500 --> 00:01:31,000
Don't try to retype it or something like that

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:33,000
copy/paste it, just to be sure

34
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,000
because if you missed a single character here

35
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:38,500
you're gonna be in the world of problems

36
00:01:38,500 --> 00:01:41,000
primarily because you will achieve nothing.

37
00:01:41,000 --> 00:01:43,369
and there will be no capture or anything of the kind.

38
00:01:43,369 --> 00:01:45,200
Now we need a file to write to

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:52,000
I will name mine "SCAN_test"

40
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:53,500
because I'm pretty sure that I...

41
00:01:53,500 --> 00:01:56,400
I usually name them "SCAN"

42
00:01:56,400 --> 00:01:58,400
That's why I want to distinguish one as "test" just in case

43
00:01:58,400 --> 00:02:02,400
just in case I have some files here as well

44
00:02:02,400 --> 00:02:06,500
and then the final thing that I'm going to need is this BSSID

45
00:02:06,500 --> 00:02:10,709
I haven't actually typed it in here.

46
00:02:10,709 --> 00:02:13,300
That was a bit neglectful

47
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:14,600
You shouldn't go here. Sorry

48
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:17,000
So just go ahead and copy it.

49
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:20,200
Let's just reformat this a little bit.

50
00:02:20,200 --> 00:02:22,200
I'm pretty sure it works like this as well

51
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,900
but we always want to make our code neat and clean

52
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:27,080
So that it can be seen and understood this is primarily

53
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:30,000
This is primarily done for troubleshooting purposes

54
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:32,610
because when you have commands and text

55
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,300
and codes spread around

56
00:02:34,300 --> 00:02:37,000
you can't really figure out what is where.

57
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:40,800
Maybe you can at that moment, but try doing it the next day

58
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,500
you will absolutely lose yourselves.

59
00:02:43,300 --> 00:02:46,239
Perhaps it doesn't work the same for everyone

60
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,200
Go ahead and press ENTER

61
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,500
Okay, what does it say?

62
00:02:49,500 --> 00:02:51,500
"No interface specified"

63
00:02:51,500 --> 00:02:54,500
So every time you do this, you actually do need specified interface.

64
00:02:54,500 --> 00:02:56,800
Mine is wlp2s0

65
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:58,100
That is my wireless interface

66
00:02:58,100 --> 00:02:59,400
That is currently in monitor mode.

67
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:01,400
So press ENTER

68
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:02,100
and there we go

69
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:07,000
We have a scan in progress, and I have another device that is hooked up.

70
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:08,000
That's this device

71
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:10,200
It's BSSID and STATION

72
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,600
STATION is a device that connected to the access point.

73
00:03:14,600 --> 00:03:17,060
You will not be able to perform this method

74
00:03:17,060 --> 00:03:21,950
if you do not have any stations that are connected to a certain access point

75
00:03:21,950 --> 00:03:23,700
or are associated with it

76
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:28,300
This is because you have nothing to authenticate.

77
00:03:28,300 --> 00:03:30,800
There is nothing conducting authentication process

78
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:33,200
which you can capture.

79
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,300
We will at the moment be authenticating this device

80
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,300
and this is also a method that you can use in order to perform a DoS attack

81
00:03:40,300 --> 00:03:41,400
on wireless networks

82
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:43,500
guaranteed to work

83
00:03:43,500 --> 00:03:48,200
Actually I'm really surprised that the wireless networks

84
00:03:48,200 --> 00:03:49,600
are so vulnerable to this.

85
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,700
Pretty much any wireless in the city or any wireless in a building

86
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:54,700
or something of a kind

87
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:56,000
will be vulnerable to this

88
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:59,100
and you will be able to deauthenticate much everybody

89
00:03:59,100 --> 00:04:01,200
even in a university or something of a kind.

90
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:02,700
It is susceptible to misuse

91
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:06,300
but I would like to ask you, since I'm doing this for education purposes

92
00:04:06,300 --> 00:04:08,000
not to do that

93
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:11,400
primarily because, as I've stated before the beginning of this tutorial

94
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:14,900
you can achieve your purpose and you can make a profit

95
00:04:14,900 --> 00:04:18,000
without doing anything against the law

96
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,000
Anyway, that being said

97
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,800
we need to use airoplay-ng

98
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,000
and this is used for deauthentication purposes.

99
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,000
So let's just go ahead and type it in here.

100
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:36,000
Once again I just tabify because there's no point to risk anything

101
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:38,800
airoplay-ng

102
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:41,700
What I want to do is pass an argument of -0

103
00:04:41,700 --> 00:04:43,000
then I'm going to give it the 0 again.

104
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:45,000
I will explain in a moment what these are .

105
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:49,200
-a and the MAC address of the access point.

106
00:04:49,200 --> 00:04:52,500
We don't need the BSSID flag there

107
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,000
Anyway, these two arguments state...

108
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,000
Basically this argument states the amount of

109
00:04:59,000 --> 00:05:02,000
deauthentication transmissions that you wish to send.

110
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:03,169
You put the 0 in

111
00:05:03,169 --> 00:05:05,700
It sends it into an infinite loop.

112
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:08,500
Basically, you will permanently deauthenticating

113
00:05:08,500 --> 00:05:13,000
pretty much every device on this particular MAC address. .

114
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:17,000
That is all the devices that are trying to associate themselves

115
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:20,800
with a wireless access point on this MAC address.

116
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,200
For example, if you want to temporarily disrupt connections

117
00:05:24,200 --> 00:05:28,200
you can type in here 10 or 9 or something like that.

118
00:05:28,200 --> 00:05:32,000
There are even options to deauthenticate particular clients

119
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,750
but for the time being, I'm just gonna send a general deauthentication request

120
00:05:36,750 --> 00:05:38,900
transmission, actually.

121
00:05:38,900 --> 00:05:44,000
This will deauthenticate everybody on this particular wireless access point

122
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,900
Since it is my wireless access point, I don't really care

123
00:05:47,900 --> 00:05:50,900
I do have only one device associated with it

124
00:05:50,900 --> 00:05:55,000
and that device will shortly be disconnected.

125
00:05:55,000 --> 00:06:00,300
Now if you wish to verify this, you can connect your cell phones or smartphones

126
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:04,400
and you connect them to your WiFi access point within your houses

127
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:06,700
or apartments or whatever

128
00:06:06,700 --> 00:06:11,000
and then you can try performing a DoS attack on yourself to see how it works.

129
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,000
It will be a fantastic exercise.

130
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:17,200
If you have any troubles, feel free to ask them the question section

131
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:18,600
but it should work.

132
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:22,500
The procedure is exactly the same as what I'm doing now.

133
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:27,600
You will then notice that the WiFi connection on your phone is breaking

134
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,200
so when that starts happening

135
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:32,300
when the deauthentication request starts being sent

136
00:06:32,300 --> 00:06:36,000
try accessing some sort of a website through your cell phone

137
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:36,800
which ever one you have

138
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,900
I don't know if it's Android or iPhone or something of a kind.

139
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:40,800
Just try doing it

140
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:43,400
You will see that you can't because there's something

141
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:44,500
obstructing your connection.

142
00:06:44,500 --> 00:06:49,000
You are no longer associated that access point.

143
00:06:49,000 --> 00:06:51,000
That is quite problematic.

144
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,800
I would recommend doing that, as that's a fantastic exercise.

145
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:55,000
You cannot cause any damage.

146
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,900
As soon as the deauthentication request starts.

147
00:06:57,900 --> 00:06:59,800
Your connection will be restored.

148
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:02,200
So let's just go ahead....I canceled press ENTER

149
00:07:02,200 --> 00:07:05,310
because I need to actually type in the interface.

150
00:07:05,310 --> 00:07:07,300
This is one of the downsides of aircrack

151
00:07:07,300 --> 00:07:09,000
I would definitely suggest that they change this

152
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:12,600
so that you don't have to type the interface every single time

153
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:14,200
but that being said

154
00:07:14,200 --> 00:07:15,000
Excellent

155
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,000
I am sending the deauthentication to broadcast the ESSID

156
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,800
There you go

157
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:23,900
and excellent

158
00:07:23,900 --> 00:07:29,400
Yep I have definitely lost my wireless on all of my devices pretty much

159
00:07:29,400 --> 00:07:33,900
or on the device that I have connected to this wireless access station

160
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:37,500
and you see, you can't just leave it running like this.

161
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:39,700
Just leave it running for awhile

162
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:42,050
just to make sure that you have deauthenticate the device

163
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,000
because you cannot see the device that you are deauthenticating.

164
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,000
You don't know if you deauthenticated it.

165
00:07:49,000 --> 00:07:51,800
So just let it run for awhile.

166
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:53,070
No problems there.

167
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:55,000
You won't lose anything.

168
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:58,000
At a certain point of time, after a couple of minutes

169
00:07:58,000 --> 00:07:59,200
probably less

170
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:01,000
you can go ahead and cancel it.

171
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,200
Due to the proximity, I can go ahead and cancel it now

172
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:11,100
and my device will try to reconnect in an automatic fashion.

173
00:08:11,100 --> 00:08:13,900
Once it does that, I will capture that deauthentication

174
00:08:13,900 --> 00:08:18,000
and it should work just fine.

175
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:24,800
In a moment, we should get a four-way handshake in the upper right corner.

176
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:26,000
There we go

177
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,900
It says "WPA handshake" for this MAC address.

178
00:08:29,900 --> 00:08:33,200
At this point of time, you can just go ahead and stop the capture process

179
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,200
as there is really no longer a point to it.

180
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:38,500
We have gotten what we needed.

181
00:08:38,500 --> 00:08:40,000
It's all here

182
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:46,000
In the next tutorial, we will take apart a file which we have captured

183
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,500
and see what we can do with it.

184
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:50,600
How we can actually crack it.

185
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:52,100
That is the difficult part of it all.

186
00:08:52,100 --> 00:08:55,700
Capturing traffic is not a problem.

187
00:08:55,700 --> 00:08:59,750
Finding the wireless access point is not a problem.

188
00:08:59,750 --> 00:09:04,000
The problem is cracking the encryption itself.

189
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:06,900
Now just keep in mind what I said in the beginning.

190
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:10,200
I want to mention this one more time before I wrap this tutorial up --

191
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:17,200
You must absolutely have at least one device that is associated with this ESSID

192
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,300
Of course if there are more devices, the better for you

193
00:09:20,300 --> 00:09:23,800
but you must at least have one

194
00:09:23,800 --> 00:09:26,100
and if there are lots of devices you might consider

195
00:09:26,100 --> 00:09:29,800
a different denial of service attack deaunthenticate them.

196
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:33,000
You should probably deauthenticate them all, select a few

197
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:34,200
and leave a few running

198
00:09:34,200 --> 00:09:38,100
So, I don't know, if you have ten or twenty of them

199
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:39,200
usually there are

200
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:42,800
in a lot of WiFi access points, you can select five of them.

201
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:45,000
So if just five of them don't work

202
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:48,200
they'll usually look to the person next to them or something like that

203
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:49,980
and they'll see that it's working for them

204
00:09:49,980 --> 00:09:52,800
and it's not working on their devices

205
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,000
but it is working on the devices on the person next door

206
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,000
or the person sitting next to them.

207
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,000
So the general conclusion that pretty much everybody draws from that --

208
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,400
"Oh it has to be something to do with my device probably. It's not working"

209
00:10:06,400 --> 00:10:07,840
or something of a kind

210
00:10:07,840 --> 00:10:13,600
I will go over this in great detail when I go into denial of service

211
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:17,400
but for the time being, just know that that is an option.

212
00:10:17,400 --> 00:10:19,000
In any case, I bid you farewell

213
00:10:19,000 --> 00:10:22,000
and I sincerely hope to see you in the follow-up tutorial

214
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,000
where we will actually cracked the code.
