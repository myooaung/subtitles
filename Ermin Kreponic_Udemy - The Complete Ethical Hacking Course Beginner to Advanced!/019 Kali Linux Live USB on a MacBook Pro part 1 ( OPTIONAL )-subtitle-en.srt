1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,380
Welcome back everybody.

2
00:00:03,415 --> 00:00:07,684
First off, let me apologize for
getting the tutorials out so late

3
00:00:07,719 --> 00:00:10,995
but I've been struggling with this on end.

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:15,412
Due to the fact that I've
encountered so many problems

5
00:00:16,508 --> 00:00:20,044
while creating a Live USB for a Mac

6
00:00:21,449 --> 00:00:23,285
I do not recommend this set-up at all.

7
00:00:24,158 --> 00:00:26,408
But since some of you have asked for the procedure

8
00:00:26,443 --> 00:00:28,069
I'm gonna do it too anyway.

9
00:00:28,104 --> 00:00:32,773
Be warned that you can
permanently damage your Mac,

10
00:00:33,786 --> 00:00:37,066
that it can literally go down.

11
00:00:37,101 --> 00:00:42,636
The only thing that you'll be
able to do afterwards is reinstall it.

12
00:00:43,626 --> 00:00:45,821
So I would advise you to get a back-up

13
00:00:46,769 --> 00:00:49,238
and if you absolutely don't have to do this

14
00:00:50,448 --> 00:00:53,454
I mean, I wouldn't recommend
it. That's what I'm trying to say.

15
00:00:53,489 --> 00:00:54,995
As it can cause a lot of problems for you

16
00:00:55,030 --> 00:00:58,763
and it can be a very painful experience.

17
00:00:59,843 --> 00:01:02,935
I will set out the procedure,
I've simplified it somewhat

18
00:01:02,970 --> 00:01:06,017
and you don't have to go into
the forums and so on and so forth,

19
00:01:07,348 --> 00:01:12,161
hopefully that is, so you'll be
able to do it, but be warned.

20
00:01:12,196 --> 00:01:16,538
I wish to build a fence
around myself here, so to say.

21
00:01:17,682 --> 00:01:21,993
On a 2013 in your Macs,
this shouldn't be a problem

22
00:01:22,028 --> 00:01:25,261
at all, you'll be able to
do a fairly simple procedure,

23
00:01:25,296 --> 00:01:28,025
a lot simpler than this, but on older Macs,

24
00:01:28,060 --> 00:01:30,806
I'm afraid that the
procedure is somewhat different

25
00:01:31,429 --> 00:01:33,940
and a bit more complicated and does carry in it

26
00:01:33,975 --> 00:01:38,953
an inherent risk that you might
mess your Mac up permanently.

27
00:01:38,988 --> 00:01:44,471
You will have to reinstall and do stuff like that.

28
00:01:45,376 --> 00:01:46,809
Just a suggestion.

29
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:54,021
For 2013 Macs here's a...

30
00:01:55,049 --> 00:01:57,634
I'm not gonna go
through that as it's fairly simple.

31
00:01:57,644 --> 00:01:59,683
You need a Mac Linux USB loader.

32
00:01:59,718 --> 00:02:03,170
You can get it from Seven Hub, I think.

33
00:02:03,205 --> 00:02:06,618
This is Unetbootin, we're gonna need that for

34
00:02:06,653 --> 00:02:10,726
later, but first off, let's go with the USB loaders,

35
00:02:10,761 --> 00:02:14,842
so "mac usb loader".

36
00:02:17,742 --> 00:02:22,023
SevenBits. GitHub. There you go.

37
00:02:22,058 --> 00:02:25,391
You can get it from here,
just download it, that's it.

38
00:02:25,426 --> 00:02:27,034
You all know how to download a file.

39
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:31,446
You can see it here, it's in the Downloads folder,

40
00:02:31,481 --> 00:02:34,874
move it to your Applications folder,

41
00:02:36,063 --> 00:02:37,102
so it should be here.

42
00:02:38,343 --> 00:02:40,934
I assure you it is here, I just can't find it.

43
00:02:40,969 --> 00:02:43,583
Ah, there we go. So Mac Linux USB Loader,

44
00:02:43,618 --> 00:02:46,103
you can see it there,
I've got the Mac ports above.

45
00:02:46,138 --> 00:02:49,013
So it says Mac Linux USB Loader.

46
00:02:52,073 --> 00:02:54,427
You won't be able to start it, or use it until...

47
00:02:54,462 --> 00:02:58,639
or at least I don't believe
that you will be able to do it

48
00:02:58,674 --> 00:03:02,039
until you actually go into System Preferences,

49
00:03:02,074 --> 00:03:05,899
Security & Privacy, unlock this.

50
00:03:09,495 --> 00:03:13,368
And then, allow apps downloaded from anywhere.

51
00:03:14,729 --> 00:03:18,745
To run, basically. So you will
need to tick all this, this might

52
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:22,079
put your computer at somewhere of a risk, but

53
00:03:22,397 --> 00:03:25,257
as I said, this is not
a recommended procedure at all.

54
00:03:26,712 --> 00:03:31,450
So go ahead and close this,
just fire up Mac Linux USB creator

55
00:03:31,485 --> 00:03:35,788
and here you have
Persistence Manager, Create Live USB.

56
00:03:35,823 --> 00:03:38,856
All you need really is an image and

57
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:42,916
just use this tool to create it and then boot it.

58
00:03:42,951 --> 00:03:48,518
Should work without any problems
on 2013 and newer MacBook Pros.

59
00:03:52,134 --> 00:03:55,370
I didn't really intend to go
through the detailed steps here

60
00:03:55,405 --> 00:03:58,610
as it's, I mean, not that required.

61
00:03:58,645 --> 00:04:02,608
I will show you how to
format a USB and you will need

62
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:06,120
to format a USB in a proper
manner regardless of whether you are

63
00:04:06,155 --> 00:04:11,140
on 2012 and older Macs or 2013 and newer Macs,

64
00:04:11,175 --> 00:04:13,174
it's completely irrelevant, you will still need

65
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:16,141
to format the USB drive, so keep that in mind.

66
00:04:19,093 --> 00:04:20,891
And these down below

67
00:04:22,414 --> 00:04:25,179
so you have... I can set the USB up.

68
00:04:29,623 --> 00:04:31,809
There's really no need
to use that, I can just go and say

69
00:04:31,844 --> 00:04:37,834
Create a Live USB, double
click on it. Select the ISO file.

70
00:04:39,911 --> 00:04:43,390
Come on, load, load, load. Please.

71
00:04:43,425 --> 00:04:45,681
Downloads. Thank you.

72
00:04:45,716 --> 00:04:49,455
So you just select the ISO file
that you have downloaded from the net,

73
00:04:49,490 --> 00:04:54,653
click on Open and you select
the device which you want here

74
00:04:54,688 --> 00:04:57,520
and you go Next and click on Begin installation.

75
00:04:57,555 --> 00:05:01,929
Once it's done reboot the Mac.
Actually don't reboot it, power it off

76
00:05:01,964 --> 00:05:07,511
and then power it back on and
select the additional option that you get.

77
00:05:09,012 --> 00:05:12,122
That should work really without
any problems, I have tested it out

78
00:05:12,157 --> 00:05:18,866
and it does work, but what I
have realized that does not work is the...

79
00:05:20,688 --> 00:05:26,368
is the procedure for
MacBook Pros that are older than 2012.

80
00:05:26,403 --> 00:05:30,936
2012 is a borderline year,
so on some it might work from 2012,

81
00:05:30,971 --> 00:05:32,636
on some it might not, I don't know.

82
00:05:32,671 --> 00:05:35,562
But anything older, this procedure will apply.

83
00:05:37,348 --> 00:05:39,580
The very first thing that you need to do is,

84
00:05:39,615 --> 00:05:44,021
as said, consider the year
of your MacBook Pro, mine is 2011.

85
00:05:44,056 --> 00:05:49,194
And then you need to have a functioning USB,

86
00:05:49,229 --> 00:05:53,384
make sure that it is functional and
not defective or anything like that.

87
00:05:55,474 --> 00:05:58,928
Recommended size should be...

88
00:05:58,963 --> 00:06:02,531
I have my 32 gigs, which is

89
00:06:02,566 --> 00:06:06,433
something that you can use,
something that I would recommend

90
00:06:07,783 --> 00:06:09,957
just to make sure
that you are not out of space at all.

91
00:06:11,890 --> 00:06:15,085
And I have another one,
which I'll use for this demonstration

92
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,479
which is 64 gigs. It might take
you a while to format larger ones,

93
00:06:19,514 --> 00:06:23,950
but there really is no reason
or need to go over 32 gigs at all.

94
00:06:25,511 --> 00:06:31,087
In regards to the
persistence storage on 2011 and older

95
00:06:32,412 --> 00:06:34,674
somewhat tricky, I haven't managed to do that.

96
00:06:36,839 --> 00:06:40,149
I have asked so many friends
and read through so many forums,

97
00:06:40,184 --> 00:06:44,332
I went to hell and farther,
and then I walked some more,

98
00:06:45,924 --> 00:06:48,224
and I went to the Apple service as well,

99
00:06:48,259 --> 00:06:51,930
I was willing to pay them
to see what they can do about it,

100
00:06:51,965 --> 00:06:53,445
and they actually did try to do it,

101
00:06:53,480 --> 00:06:55,682
but they also have failed miserably,

102
00:06:55,717 --> 00:06:58,359
so they didn't charge
me anything for it, which is nice.

103
00:06:59,865 --> 00:07:02,657
Then I went to some other acquaintances

104
00:07:04,417 --> 00:07:08,620
and we finally managed to get
some sort of a hybrid state working,

105
00:07:08,655 --> 00:07:13,155
where you have one bootable
partition, which is non-persistent,

106
00:07:13,190 --> 00:07:17,304
and you have another
partition, which is xte4 format

107
00:07:17,982 --> 00:07:22,696
and then you can save whatever
you want there, whatever files you want

108
00:07:22,731 --> 00:07:27,387
which is very nice if you want
to download files and storage them,

109
00:07:27,422 --> 00:07:29,792
but also is very nice if you
want to keep your configuration.

110
00:07:29,827 --> 00:07:33,742
So what you can do is
make small configuration scripts

111
00:07:33,777 --> 00:07:37,579
or one big configuration script that you just run

112
00:07:37,614 --> 00:07:40,421
once everytime you boot the machine up,

113
00:07:40,456 --> 00:07:44,838
so it configures the live
image the way you want it to be.

114
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:49,797
I don't think it's a huge hindrance.

115
00:07:49,832 --> 00:07:52,336
Basically, once you make the
script you just add the commands to it

116
00:07:52,371 --> 00:07:57,796
and you just need to click it
once or run it once in order to

117
00:07:57,831 --> 00:08:00,344
basically have your set-up configured

118
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:04,154
the way you want it to
be configured. On newer Macs

119
00:08:04,189 --> 00:08:09,380
I'm pretty sure it shouldn't
be a problem of any kind or sort.

120
00:08:10,746 --> 00:08:15,126
Let's go ahead and proceed with
this tutorial and see how this works out

121
00:08:15,161 --> 00:08:18,505
and see what we can actually do and accomplish.

122
00:08:18,540 --> 00:08:20,401
Be warned, it can mess your Mac up

123
00:08:20,436 --> 00:08:23,208
to the point where you need to reinstall it.

124
00:08:23,243 --> 00:08:26,534
Keep that in mind before you
decide to go through this procedure.

125
00:08:26,569 --> 00:08:28,486
Think twice. I'm serious.

126
00:08:29,903 --> 00:08:36,517
Anyway, go out onto the net,
open up your browser and find this site,

127
00:08:36,552 --> 00:08:41,041
it's unetbootin.github.io.

128
00:08:42,687 --> 00:08:44,947
Here, let's just type it in.

129
00:08:54,890 --> 00:08:57,712
Just do it from the search and
there you go, the first one that pops out.

130
00:08:58,575 --> 00:09:02,767
Make sure it's https.
It says unetbootin.github.io.

131
00:09:02,802 --> 00:09:06,431
Open it up, click on Downloads for Mac OS X,

132
00:09:06,466 --> 00:09:08,879
I already downloaded it,
it's in my Downloads folder,

133
00:09:08,914 --> 00:09:11,267
so once you click on it,
it's gonna go into your Downloads folder

134
00:09:12,571 --> 00:09:16,028
and hopefully you went into Settings and allowed

135
00:09:20,333 --> 00:09:22,552
the applications to install and run from anywhere.

136
00:09:22,587 --> 00:09:25,419
As I said, that puts your
computer to somewhere at risk

137
00:09:25,804 --> 00:09:28,094
but that is a necessary step.

138
00:09:28,129 --> 00:09:31,863
Keep in mind, I have stated
before and I am restating it,

139
00:09:31,898 --> 00:09:32,991
it is not a recommended configuration.

140
00:09:35,189 --> 00:09:39,426
Now that that is done,
go over to your Downloads folder

141
00:09:39,461 --> 00:09:41,998
and find unetbootin, there you go.

142
00:09:42,033 --> 00:09:45,662
It's right there,
that is the tool that we shall need.

143
00:09:45,697 --> 00:09:47,799
That is the only thing
that you need to download from

144
00:09:47,834 --> 00:09:49,537
the net, from the sites.

145
00:09:53,462 --> 00:09:55,299
The rest of the files I'll provide on Udemy

146
00:09:55,334 --> 00:09:58,774
from where you can actually
download them and use them.

147
00:10:00,582 --> 00:10:05,076
Let's go ahead and leave
that there for the time being

148
00:10:05,111 --> 00:10:07,266
and go into our Disk Utility.

149
00:10:15,778 --> 00:10:17,094
Have you noticed that things on Mac

150
00:10:17,129 --> 00:10:19,467
just don't tend to close
the way you want them to close?

151
00:10:22,064 --> 00:10:25,159
They just get minimized, but OK, no big deal.

152
00:10:25,194 --> 00:10:27,837
So Command+Espace and search for

153
00:10:33,571 --> 00:10:36,561
Disk Utility, press Enter.

154
00:10:36,596 --> 00:10:44,224
Open it up. At the moment I have
two USBs plugged in and I'm not gonna

155
00:10:44,259 --> 00:10:49,005
wait for the burning to
complete because that will take forever,

156
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,044
took me forever anyway, but I will
show you what to do and how to do it.

157
00:11:12,881 --> 00:11:15,388
There we go, so both of them are hooked up,

158
00:11:15,423 --> 00:11:20,409
I'm using a USB hub on the
other end to plug multiple things in

159
00:11:20,444 --> 00:11:25,473
because Macs suffer
apparently from a chronic lack of ports,

160
00:11:25,508 --> 00:11:27,574
which is annoying beyond belief.

161
00:11:28,839 --> 00:11:30,423
But OK, no problems.

162
00:11:31,869 --> 00:11:37,246
Over here is the USB port
which we shall be playing

163
00:11:37,281 --> 00:11:41,470
and down below is another USB which I will use

164
00:11:41,505 --> 00:11:45,024
to show you where the files
are, actually I can use both of them.

165
00:11:45,059 --> 00:11:51,990
So what you need to do is,
first, go ahead and hit the Toshiba

166
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:59,604
and state that you want to
erase it, so we're gonna go over to Erase

167
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:03,322
and it says MS-DOS (FAT), name Untitled.

168
00:12:03,357 --> 00:12:06,490
You can change the name, let's call it Kali.

169
00:12:10,322 --> 00:12:11,817
You can call it whatever you want, feel free.

170
00:12:11,852 --> 00:12:15,337
Let you imagination go.

171
00:12:15,372 --> 00:12:18,409
And we're gonna go ahead and state Erase.

172
00:12:18,444 --> 00:12:23,368
It's warning me that I have
two partitions which will get erased.

173
00:12:23,403 --> 00:12:27,421
I'm fine with that. Can't unmount the disk,

174
00:12:27,456 --> 00:12:29,186
why can't you unmount the disk?

175
00:12:42,675 --> 00:12:44,891
What is using it?

176
00:12:44,926 --> 00:12:47,086
OK, so this might happen to you as well,

177
00:12:47,121 --> 00:12:48,679
so I'm just leaving it in the tutorial.

178
00:12:48,714 --> 00:12:52,166
The disk "UNTITLED" couldn't be
erased because "Terminal" is using it.

179
00:12:56,123 --> 00:12:57,834
How is the terminal using it, I wonder.

180
00:12:57,869 --> 00:12:59,796
Maybe I was in the folder or something.

181
00:13:01,878 --> 00:13:05,696
Because the Terminal
is using it. I am not using it!

182
00:13:05,731 --> 00:13:08,002
Oh, right, wait, wait.

183
00:13:14,328 --> 00:13:17,056
So I might be making a
complete fool of myself here

184
00:13:21,539 --> 00:13:24,702
but I'm just gonna go ahead
and try to do it one more time here

185
00:13:24,737 --> 00:13:29,260
and then I'm gonna go into,
basically, forcefully, ripping it out.

186
00:13:32,780 --> 00:13:35,854
Force Quit.

187
00:13:38,996 --> 00:13:41,451
Yes, please, leave.

188
00:13:42,910 --> 00:13:48,834
There we go, so it is out and
now we no longer have it here

189
00:13:48,869 --> 00:13:51,328
which is not something we want,

190
00:13:51,363 --> 00:13:54,839
so we're just gonna take
it out and then plug it back in

191
00:13:56,339 --> 00:13:58,498
and see, will that help out?

192
00:14:01,527 --> 00:14:05,846
Okay, Toshiba, so let's go
ahead and click on it, go into Erase,

193
00:14:05,881 --> 00:14:11,606
Erase, Erase. And unmounting, come on.

194
00:14:11,641 --> 00:14:13,686
Please, be successful.

195
00:14:16,592 --> 00:14:19,590
OK, it's formatting the disk.

196
00:14:19,625 --> 00:14:24,207
Eventually it should
finish. There we go, it is done.

197
00:14:26,199 --> 00:14:30,866
We have erased it once, and
now we're gonna go into Partitions.

198
00:14:30,901 --> 00:14:35,737
Let's go choose 2 partitions
and we're gonna label the first one.

199
00:14:37,162 --> 00:14:40,957
I'm gonna give the first one like 9 gigs,

200
00:14:40,992 --> 00:14:44,089
even though that's not gonna be usable probably,

201
00:14:44,124 --> 00:14:47,137
but doesn't really matter. And the second one

202
00:14:47,172 --> 00:14:51,491
is whatever remains,
doesn't really matter. At all.

203
00:14:51,526 --> 00:14:52,912
So whatever the second one is,

204
00:14:52,947 --> 00:14:55,259
that's what the second
one is, whatever space remains.

205
00:14:55,294 --> 00:15:00,449
I'm gonna go ahead and click on Apply.

206
00:15:00,484 --> 00:15:08,854
OK, so just state
Partition and let it go, let it finish.

207
00:15:08,889 --> 00:15:16,327
This part shouldn't take long.
The other part can hang for quite a while

208
00:15:16,362 --> 00:15:19,811
and it can be annoying. Pretty annoying.

209
00:15:19,846 --> 00:15:23,615
Now the next thing that we need to do is actually

210
00:15:23,650 --> 00:15:27,357
mess around with the second partition,

211
00:15:28,618 --> 00:15:31,157
but we are going to do that later on.

212
00:15:31,192 --> 00:15:33,837
For the time being, we're just
gonna deal with the first partition

213
00:15:33,872 --> 00:15:37,103
and we're gonna attempt to create

214
00:15:37,138 --> 00:15:40,426
a bootable USB on the
first partition of the drive.

215
00:15:40,461 --> 00:15:44,744
So we no longer need
this. Now, I would like you to go

216
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:48,626
back into Downloads,
where our unetbootin is stored.

217
00:15:54,043 --> 00:15:58,387
There we go, so just start it.
It's gonna request for your permission.

218
00:16:00,826 --> 00:16:02,402
Give it.

219
00:16:04,243 --> 00:16:05,777
If you want, that is.

220
00:16:09,322 --> 00:16:11,739
I don't really care about
my passwords here anyway,

221
00:16:11,774 --> 00:16:15,626
they're just nonsense. I will reformat

222
00:16:15,661 --> 00:16:20,670
this whole drive, this whole computer

223
00:16:20,705 --> 00:16:23,618
because I've done so much
stuff to it just to get this to work,

224
00:16:23,653 --> 00:16:26,581
it would take way too long to fix it manually.

225
00:16:30,201 --> 00:16:32,790
Okay, don't need VirtualBox at the moment.

226
00:16:33,814 --> 00:16:37,110
Is unetbootin fired up?
Please, tell me that it is. Right here.

227
00:16:37,160 --> 00:16:42,037
So we have unetbootin here and we're gonna say

228
00:16:42,072 --> 00:16:45,797
"Diskimage", ISO, select a disk image

229
00:16:47,428 --> 00:16:53,067
I'm assuming that you have
downloaded Kali from the net, here it is.

230
00:16:53,102 --> 00:16:57,359
If you haven't, I mean
I always show this, I don't think less of you

231
00:16:57,394 --> 00:16:59,290
but I always like to show it just in case,

232
00:16:59,325 --> 00:17:02,695
because always somebody will
ask like they skipped a tutorial or two

233
00:17:02,730 --> 00:17:05,128
"where can I download it?" even if I have showed it

234
00:17:05,163 --> 00:17:08,314
in the previous tutorial. Just go to Kali Linux,

235
00:17:08,349 --> 00:17:14,537
press Enter and look, it's here, go to Downloads

236
00:17:14,572 --> 00:17:17,783
and there you go,
so you can download it from here.

237
00:17:17,818 --> 00:17:20,514
You can download the ISO
or if you have a torrent client,

238
00:17:20,549 --> 00:17:21,968
you can just go via torrent.

239
00:17:22,003 --> 00:17:25,537
Just click on it, on the ISO,
and that's it. If you have a torrent,

240
00:17:25,572 --> 00:17:28,312
you can go over to
torrents as well, a client, that is.

241
00:17:30,779 --> 00:17:35,415
OK, so let's go ahead and select the amd64.iso,

242
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:40,081
say Open. It says USB Drive.

243
00:17:40,116 --> 00:17:45,847
Make sure to select the
right one. Don't take the wrong drive,

244
00:17:45,882 --> 00:17:49,654
this can be detrimental in the worst of senses.

245
00:17:49,689 --> 00:17:55,421
Pop up the terminal. Type in...
I'm just gonna go and clear the screen.

246
00:17:55,456 --> 00:18:04,717
Then I'm gonna do "diskutil list". So disk one is

247
00:18:04,752 --> 00:18:08,334
says Untitled 1, Untitled 2.

248
00:18:08,369 --> 00:18:12,335
Actually we could have
renamed them, but I don't really care.

249
00:18:12,370 --> 00:18:13,903
You can do so if you wish.

250
00:18:13,938 --> 00:18:22,050
This is the one that we need, so disk1 and disk1s1.

251
00:18:22,085 --> 00:18:27,233
That's the one that we really
want, so let's go ahead and select that.

252
00:18:27,268 --> 00:18:35,035
Disk1s1, that is perfectly
fine. Let's go ahead and say OK.

253
00:18:35,070 --> 00:18:38,998
And this is gonna
take for... well, maybe not forever,

254
00:18:39,033 --> 00:18:41,291
but don't worry if it hangs in a single file.

255
00:18:43,058 --> 00:18:45,481
You see, this is 78MB, so this is gonna be longer

256
00:18:45,516 --> 00:18:47,917
and then you're gonna
have another one, which is 200MB

257
00:18:47,952 --> 00:18:52,001
and that's gonna take
even longer, so just let it run, let it run.

258
00:18:52,201 --> 00:18:57,419
Just let it run. You see,
this is 2832MB. Just let it run.

259
00:18:57,454 --> 00:18:59,398
It's gonna be a while before it finishes.

260
00:18:59,433 --> 00:19:02,799
I don't know, go have
a walk, cup of coffee, whatever.

261
00:19:02,834 --> 00:19:06,682
If you wanted to rename
your Kali, you can go ahead and do this:

262
00:19:09,891 --> 00:19:11,653
so Disk Utility.

263
00:19:16,001 --> 00:19:19,104
Come on. Please, I'm running out of time.

264
00:19:22,762 --> 00:19:26,069
So during the formatting time, you can click on

265
00:19:28,179 --> 00:19:30,460
Erase and then it's gonna...

266
00:19:30,495 --> 00:19:33,167
then you can change the name here if you want.

267
00:19:33,202 --> 00:19:35,589
If you don't want it,
you can leave it with Untitled.

268
00:19:35,624 --> 00:19:41,139
Whatever you want. Anyway,
I'm gonna call this tutorial here

269
00:19:41,174 --> 00:19:44,153
and we're gonna come back when this is done.
