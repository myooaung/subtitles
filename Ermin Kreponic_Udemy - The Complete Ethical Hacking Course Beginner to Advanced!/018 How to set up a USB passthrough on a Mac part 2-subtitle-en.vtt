00:00:00.400 --> 00:00:06.104

Okay, so the fix was amazingly simple.



2

00:00:06.339 --> 00:00:10.126

I basically figured it out

the moment I stopped it.



3

00:00:13.103 --> 00:00:15.334

I will share it with you because you need to know



4

00:00:15.569 --> 00:00:17.778

and this will block you as well most likely.



5

00:00:18.737 --> 00:00:22.397

So first of all, you see

the icon in the upper right corner



6

00:00:22.632 --> 00:00:24.774

the one that I'm pointing with my mouse now



7

00:00:24.909 --> 00:00:28.176

the one that is lit up, the wireless symbol,



8

00:00:28.411 --> 00:00:32.190

not of my Mac but of this

virtual machine, it needs to look like this.



9

00:00:33.407 --> 00:00:36.140

Why didn't it work?

as you can see, it's working now



10

00:00:36.375 --> 00:00:40.117

so if I type in "ping google.com"



11

00:00:41.924 --> 00:00:43.478

the pings are passing through,



12

00:00:43.613 --> 00:00:45.669

and if you think that I did

some shenanigans with the network,



13

00:00:45.704 --> 00:00:50.679

I did not touch it, you see the network status



14

00:00:50.714 --> 00:00:54.116

is still not attached at all, I didn't touch this.



15

00:00:57.123 --> 00:00:59.066

What happened here is pretty much



16

00:01:00.788 --> 00:01:02.790

what does happen sometimes when I switch



17

00:01:03.685 --> 00:01:05.799

from my wired to wireless connection.



18

00:01:07.882 --> 00:01:11.130

It basically keeps on using the wired interface



19

00:01:11.265 --> 00:01:13.620

even though there is no connection on it



20

00:01:14.055 --> 00:01:18.260

and it doesn't know that I've

disconnected it or something like that.



21

00:01:19.294 --> 00:01:21.045

It still sticks to the IP there



22

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.204

and it attempts to send

packets through that interface



23

00:01:23.339 --> 00:01:26.221

but it simply cannot, it's not possible.



24

00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.629

Therefore, what you need to do is the following:



25

00:01:30.754 --> 00:01:36.002

Just clear the screen and type in "ifconfig eth0".



26

00:01:37.687 --> 00:01:39.769

You see, this is the Ethernet interface



27

00:01:39.904 --> 00:01:44.032

and you need to type in "ifconfig eth0 down".



28

00:01:45.544 --> 00:01:49.687

And then you need to

basically type this command in,



29

00:01:49.922 --> 00:01:51.879

where do I have it? There we go,



30

00:01:52.014 --> 00:01:56.505

so "systemctl restart network-manager", Enter.



31

00:01:58.085 --> 00:01:59.808

It just restarted, that's all you need to do,



32

00:02:01.344 --> 00:02:04.236

and I can type in "ifconfig" again.



33

00:02:05.934 --> 00:02:08.347

The interface is back up



34

00:02:09.891 --> 00:02:13.990

but, you see, that it does

not have an IPv4 address at all,



35

00:02:14.125 --> 00:02:16.645

there is no IPv4 address here,



36

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.773

rather instead, the IPv4 address is here,



37

00:02:20.008 --> 00:02:24.071

as you can see, it's 192.158.1.10.



38

00:02:24.206 --> 00:02:27.739

And there you have it,

it's there, it's functioning, I can use it.



39

00:02:27.774 --> 00:02:31.551

So if I type in "ping google.com" again



40

00:02:31.686 --> 00:02:35.351

it works, it's passing through, I'm gonna stop it



41

00:02:35.486 --> 00:02:37.875

and let's try to open up Udemy one more time.



42

00:02:40.378 --> 00:02:44.551

There we go, I'm not using

my Mac connection at all here.



43

00:02:44.686 --> 00:02:48.768

I can actually turn the Wi-Fi off on my Mac and



44

00:02:50.367 --> 00:02:53.633

I am still going to be able to do this.



45

00:02:53.868 --> 00:02:55.815

Let me open Udemy Facebook.



46

00:02:58.384 --> 00:03:01.467

It's gonna open it up, maybe

it's gonna be a bit tardy, a bit slow



47

00:03:01.702 --> 00:03:06.018

but it's a virtual machine, so... forgive it.



48

00:03:07.667 --> 00:03:09.784

There you go, I mean, it will open the site,



49

00:03:09.919 --> 00:03:12.203

it's just a little bit slow,

but there you go. It's open.



50

00:03:12.438 --> 00:03:14.910

I just wanted to demonstrate even though



51

00:03:15.045 --> 00:03:17.354

my Wi-Fi is off on my MacBook Pro



52

00:03:18.357 --> 00:03:22.969

and I don't have any connection now,

I'm gonna turn it back on,



53

00:03:24.425 --> 00:03:26.742

but that's it. So look,



54

00:03:26.977 --> 00:03:31.678

this is the very first time in my entire life



55

00:03:31.813 --> 00:03:35.146

I mean, literally, in my

entire life, that I've used the Mac.



56

00:03:35.181 --> 00:03:39.783

Sure I come from a long background of Linux,



57

00:03:39.918 --> 00:03:43.694

and I have used it extensively

and I have suffered with it extensively



58

00:03:43.829 --> 00:03:47.607

until I've learned it. But this, for me,



59

00:03:47.642 --> 00:03:49.975

is the very first time that I've used the Mac.



60

00:03:50.110 --> 00:03:52.184

Sure the Linux does give

me a little bit of an advantage



61

00:03:52.319 --> 00:03:55.289

to a Windows user, but still, keep in mind



62

00:03:55.624 --> 00:03:59.205

this is the very first time that

I've used the Mac in my entire life.



63

00:04:00.487 --> 00:04:03.177

And I have managed to get this to work.



64

00:04:04.470 --> 00:04:08.358

This was the first try,

in front of everybody, live as you saw.



65

00:04:08.393 --> 00:04:11.990

I encountered stupid

problems, I encountered stupid errors,



66

00:04:15.025 --> 00:04:17.026

none of them were too complicated or complex,



67

00:04:17.261 --> 00:04:18.905

but they were just kind of stupid, I mean,



68

00:04:18.848 --> 00:04:23.543

I didn't know how to

unzip a file on a Mac, basically.



69

00:04:23.978 --> 00:04:29.209

It was that stupid, so I went onto

the net and I researched for Homebrew



70

00:04:29.344 --> 00:04:31.323

and I figured out that there was something called



71

00:04:31.358 --> 00:04:33.102

Homebrew and there is Macports



72

00:04:33.337 --> 00:04:37.949

and I've researched extensively on

Stack Overflow, on Buffer Overflow,



73

00:04:37.984 --> 00:04:39.554

actually, Stack Overflow.



74

00:04:40.853 --> 00:04:43.802

I've looked through the Apple's

forums, I've looked everywhere



75

00:04:43.937 --> 00:04:46.052

and I figured out where they're safe or not



76

00:04:46.287 --> 00:04:48.283

and then I went through all of these installations.



77

00:04:48.418 --> 00:04:50.540

As you can see, they were kind of slow,



78

00:04:50.775 --> 00:04:54.164

I wasn't sure what I was doing, I was inching



79

00:04:55.265 --> 00:04:57.642

and moving and figuring it out together with you



80

00:04:57.677 --> 00:05:02.071

and I wanted to do it this way

because this puts me in your shoes,



81

00:05:02.206 --> 00:05:05.703

this puts me in the shoes of

somebody who has experienced problems



82

00:05:05.938 --> 00:05:10.261

and basically, like this I can

do it from your perspective



83

00:05:10.396 --> 00:05:15.108

and you see it does work.

There's no need to install anything on a Mac,



84

00:05:15.443 --> 00:05:19.454

you don't need any

additional drivers on it. Nothing.



85

00:05:19.589 --> 00:05:21.926

You just need to download

the extensions for VirtualBox,



86

00:05:22.061 --> 00:05:25.059

that's it, plug a USB in. Your Mac won't see it,



87

00:05:25.194 --> 00:05:26.818

you won't be able to use it on your Mac,



88

00:05:26.853 --> 00:05:28.556

if you want to use it on your Mac, you can go



89

00:05:28.962 --> 00:05:31.375

and download the drivers

for it if you really want it,



90

00:05:31.995 --> 00:05:33.761

but there's no point to use it on a Mac.



91

00:05:33.796 --> 00:05:36.743

I mean, you already have a wireless card on a Mac.



92

00:05:38.012 --> 00:05:41.282

And I just downloaded the

extensions from Oracle VirtualBox,



93

00:05:41.517 --> 00:05:46.134

plug the USB in, there was no activity on it



94

00:05:46.269 --> 00:05:50.952

until I booted up the Kali Linux

virtual machine to control the USB



95

00:05:51.723 --> 00:05:55.623

and I was able to utilize it here in the VM.



96

00:05:55.758 --> 00:05:57.732

First try,



97

00:05:58.901 --> 00:06:02.108

things were hairy, but I've

managed to go through it all



98

00:06:02.443 --> 00:06:05.690

and managed to set it up

without any problems of whatsoever.



99

00:06:05.925 --> 00:06:10.787

So this is a proof that it works

in a Mac without any problems,



100

00:06:10.822 --> 00:06:13.921

this is Yosemite, latest updates,



101

00:06:15.253 --> 00:06:17.402

sure the Mac is a little bit old, it's from 2011,



102

00:06:17.737 --> 00:06:20.457

but it's running Yosemite on latest updates



103

00:06:23.546 --> 00:06:27.207

and basicaly there is not that

much difference from Mac from 2015.



104

00:06:27.342 --> 00:06:31.414

Sure you have a better display,

but that doesn't affect your USB.



105

00:06:33.128 --> 00:06:35.029

You have a bit of a different hardware inside,



106

00:06:35.164 --> 00:06:38.118

again, doesn't affect your USB port pass-through.



107

00:06:40.390 --> 00:06:44.431

That's pretty much the same,

maybe the only thing that can be different



108

00:06:44.566 --> 00:06:47.327

from this Mac and from

one of 2015 is that that one



109

00:06:47.462 --> 00:06:51.533

that was produced in 2015

will be a lot faster than this one,



110

00:06:51.668 --> 00:06:55.468

perhaps due to flash

storage, perhaps a better processor,



111

00:06:56.942 --> 00:06:58.700

a better RAM and so on and so forth.



112

00:07:01.651 --> 00:07:04.433

If you have any questions,

if you get stuck anywhere along the way



113

00:07:05.876 --> 00:07:07.999

you are, of course, free to post your questions



114

00:07:08.134 --> 00:07:12.103

in the discussion section and I,

as always, will be more than happy



115

00:07:12.138 --> 00:07:15.958

to help you all out as much as I can, but



116

00:07:17.227 --> 00:07:18.930

the very first thing that I would advise you to do



117

00:07:19.065 --> 00:07:23.045

is to actually just take a deep breath,



118

00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:25.846

walk away from your computer, come back,



119

00:07:25.981 --> 00:07:29.012

take a look at the lecture one more time,



120

00:07:30.173 --> 00:07:34.360

slowly, see what I've done,

I haven't skipped any of the steps.



121

00:07:34.395 --> 00:07:36.171

At least, I hope that I didn't.



122

00:07:37.279 --> 00:07:39.990

And try to redo the process.



123

00:07:41.259 --> 00:07:44.565

Also, there are many forums that are your friends.



124

00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:47.085

You can go to Apple forums, you can



125

00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:52.296

go to Linux forums, one of the

Linux forums that I would recommend is



126

00:07:52.331 --> 00:07:54.981

linux.org/linuxquestions



127

00:07:57.913 --> 00:07:59.875

and then you can go to Stack Overflow as well,



128

00:08:01.306 --> 00:08:03.474

they have some really nice sections there as well.



129

00:08:03.509 --> 00:08:08.128

Anyway, I really hope that

this has helped you out a ton



130

00:08:08.263 --> 00:08:11.557

and that you have

managed to get it to work on a Mac.



131

00:08:11.792 --> 00:08:14.911

As you can see, it's not really that much different



132

00:08:15.246 --> 00:08:18.267

from a Windows installation

or from a Linux installation.



133

00:08:18.502 --> 00:08:20.798

It's a little bit different

from a Linux installation



134

00:08:20.933 --> 00:08:24.337

but it's not that different

from a Windows installation at all



135

00:08:24.372 --> 00:08:28.500

and I have chosen the simplest

possible way of installing a Kali VM



136

00:08:29.954 --> 00:08:33.078

within a Mac, so I didn't even

perform the installation with an ISO.



137

00:08:33.213 --> 00:08:36.815

I just downloaded a

prepacked version for VirtualBox



138

00:08:36.950 --> 00:08:39.854

so that you wouldn't have

to bother with any of those things.



139

00:08:40.089 --> 00:08:41.671

I bid you all farewell



140

00:08:41.806 --> 00:08:44.968

and let me know in the

discussions what you think of this,



141

00:08:45.103 --> 00:08:49.416

was this helpful and would you

like to see more videos in regard to Mac,



142

00:08:49.451 --> 00:08:51.677

and what sort of videos

would you like to see with Mac.



143

00:08:51.812 --> 00:08:53.778

Anything that's doable or makes sense,



144

00:08:54.213 --> 00:08:57.705

I will take into

consideration and perhaps try to do.



145

00:08:57.840 --> 00:09:00.294

Till then, I bid you farewell.
