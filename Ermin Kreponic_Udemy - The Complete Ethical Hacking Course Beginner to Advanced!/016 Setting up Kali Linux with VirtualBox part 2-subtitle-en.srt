1
00:00:01,541 --> 00:00:04,565
So if everything went fine, you should get

2
00:00:04,978 --> 00:00:07,909
this sort of an output, like I got it here,

3
00:00:07,944 --> 00:00:11,546
the one that I am selecting now.
You can see it on the screen.

4
00:00:11,881 --> 00:00:15,020
So this is something that you
should get. It didn't last that long,

5
00:00:15,055 --> 00:00:19,332
maybe five to ten more
minutes, something like that.

6
00:00:19,367 --> 00:00:22,285
I really don't know,
I'm not sure, I didn't exactly time it.

7
00:00:22,420 --> 00:00:26,178
That's just my approximate estimate, nothing more.

8
00:00:27,658 --> 00:00:32,090
Now that that is done, we can
go ahead and clear the screen

9
00:00:33,169 --> 00:00:36,016
and then go into the Downloads folder and

10
00:00:36,951 --> 00:00:37,722
we will have something like this,

11
00:00:37,857 --> 00:00:42,648
it says Kali-Linux-2.0.0-vbox-amd64.ova.

12
00:00:42,683 --> 00:00:45,948
Let's go ahead and double
tap on it and see what happens.

13
00:00:48,261 --> 00:00:53,510
Nice. OK, so it says
that it allots one CPU, 2GB of RAM.

14
00:00:55,077 --> 00:00:57,505
I sincerely hope that you have

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,158
enough RAM on your Mac, if you have 4 gigs of RAM

16
00:01:03,630 --> 00:01:05,552
I mean, it should work still,

17
00:01:05,587 --> 00:01:09,159
you can always resize it later, it's no big deal.

18
00:01:12,684 --> 00:01:16,050
If you just have 4 gigs,
you might want to resize that later.

19
00:01:16,185 --> 00:01:19,709
I'll show you how to
resize it, but if you have like 6 or 8...

20
00:01:20,595 --> 00:01:22,131
I don't think you're gonna have 6.

21
00:01:22,366 --> 00:01:24,719
If you have like 8 or 16 or something of a kind,

22
00:01:26,848 --> 00:01:28,615
then it is completely irrelevant,

23
00:01:29,776 --> 00:01:32,014
you will be able to function like so

24
00:01:32,049 --> 00:01:34,004
without any problems of whatsoever.

25
00:01:35,074 --> 00:01:37,134
Just go ahead and click on Import.

26
00:01:40,001 --> 00:01:44,922
And it says "importing".
Well, these downtimes and waiting...

27
00:01:44,957 --> 00:01:46,633
this is murderous,

28
00:01:46,868 --> 00:01:49,185
but you gotta wait through it.

29
00:01:49,220 --> 00:01:51,522
While this is going on let me just tell you that

30
00:01:51,757 --> 00:01:54,801
during the past few days I have not found

31
00:01:54,936 --> 00:01:57,722
the MacBook Pro battery lacking.

32
00:01:57,757 --> 00:02:02,139
It is fantastic. It does last
for quite a while, which is amazing.

33
00:02:05,541 --> 00:02:07,510
Come on, my good man, come on.

34
00:02:07,745 --> 00:02:13,159
Why are you giving me like
twelve minutes to just import the image?

35
00:02:13,394 --> 00:02:15,077
It should be faster than that.

36
00:02:17,183 --> 00:02:21,281
I guess I shall segment
this video and make it like,

37
00:02:21,316 --> 00:02:26,714
make one tutorial of multiple
parts, so I will merge them together.

38
00:02:26,749 --> 00:02:28,926
So let's just call it here and then

39
00:02:29,061 --> 00:02:31,163
I will merge the next part with this as soon as

40
00:02:31,398 --> 00:02:33,955
the 11-12 minutes have passed, most likely 15,

41
00:02:35,056 --> 00:02:40,128
so you don't have to sit here
and hear me ramble until this is done.

42
00:02:43,408 --> 00:02:47,073
Once it is done you will get a screen like this.

43
00:02:54,102 --> 00:02:56,399
If you're wondering
where this is on the file system

44
00:02:56,434 --> 00:03:00,667
I'm guessing it should be in the
same place as it is on a Linux machine

45
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:04,626
so let's go ahead and type in "cd".

46
00:03:07,134 --> 00:03:11,727
Revert back to the Home
directory of the current user,

47
00:03:11,762 --> 00:03:13,725
so that user's Udemy here.

48
00:03:15,260 --> 00:03:18,122
And let's do "ls" from here and there you go.

49
00:03:18,157 --> 00:03:22,364
You see how it says "VirtualBox VMs".

50
00:03:22,399 --> 00:03:26,771
If you go to cd, VirtualBox, VMs,

51
00:03:28,575 --> 00:03:30,883
you can see this Kali image.

52
00:03:31,018 --> 00:03:35,204
It is here, it is functional, it is working.

53
00:03:36,646 --> 00:03:39,214
Whether it's working or not
we actually have to check that.

54
00:03:39,249 --> 00:03:44,141
Now, if you have only 4 gigs
of RAM available on your Mac

55
00:03:45,557 --> 00:03:48,491
just go ahead and I go into...

56
00:03:48,526 --> 00:03:50,127
right click here...

57
00:03:50,884 --> 00:03:54,443
for me right click is just
two fingers touching the touchpad

58
00:03:54,478 --> 00:04:00,458
and then go into Settings, you
can go into System, if I'm not mistaken

59
00:04:00,493 --> 00:04:04,744
and then you can move
this pointer left to reduce it

60
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:06,713
and right to increase the amount of RAM.

61
00:04:06,848 --> 00:04:09,791
You can only do this
while the machine is powered off,

62
00:04:09,826 --> 00:04:13,007
and not while the machine is powered on.

63
00:04:14,460 --> 00:04:18,752
And this is very nice.
I can actually use 16 CPU cores.

64
00:04:18,787 --> 00:04:21,993
which is, I have four actual...

65
00:04:25,782 --> 00:04:28,851
and eight virtual? No, I have four actual and...

66
00:04:31,557 --> 00:04:35,549
that should be twelve
virtual cores, which is very nice

67
00:04:35,584 --> 00:04:40,791
if my guess is right, because
this has a quad-core processor in it.

68
00:04:40,826 --> 00:04:49,396
But 16 CPUs means that I can
run 15 virtual machines here at once.

69
00:04:49,831 --> 00:04:53,944
I know, right? It would
probably overload the system

70
00:04:53,979 --> 00:04:58,336
or load it to its maximum and
the system would be rather slow,

71
00:04:58,371 --> 00:05:01,002
but I could actually run 15 virtual machines

72
00:05:01,037 --> 00:05:04,171
in one actual, which is very nice.

73
00:05:05,679 --> 00:05:07,980
So all of this, we're not gonna need it for now.

74
00:05:08,015 --> 00:05:10,256
For the time being, I just
want you to go into System

75
00:05:10,691 --> 00:05:14,862
and be able to adjust the size of RAM just in case

76
00:05:14,897 --> 00:05:20,067
you have just 4GB available on your Mac.

77
00:05:20,302 --> 00:05:23,222
But if you have more than 4GB

78
00:05:23,257 --> 00:05:26,672
you can just leave it
at default and not touch it at all.

79
00:05:26,707 --> 00:05:30,316
So let's go ahead and
power on for the very first time

80
00:05:30,351 --> 00:05:33,001
our Kali Linux machine, just double tap on it

81
00:05:34,444 --> 00:05:37,366
and pray that it starts and works.

82
00:05:38,589 --> 00:05:40,160
So this is a first install.

83
00:05:42,579 --> 00:05:44,250
I'm just gonna go ahead and select that one.

84
00:05:46,892 --> 00:05:48,651
It says "loading, please wait".

85
00:05:51,402 --> 00:05:54,877
I'm so hoping that this
prebuild version already has

86
00:05:54,912 --> 00:05:58,595
the Guest Additions
installed, that would be so nice,

87
00:05:58,630 --> 00:06:01,323
but if it does not, no big deal,

88
00:06:01,358 --> 00:06:04,236
we will be able to install them ourselves.

89
00:06:05,562 --> 00:06:08,040
It says failed to the vulnerability assessment.

90
00:06:08,075 --> 00:06:11,202
Don't worry about that,
you can install it additionally

91
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:13,130
and configure it, but, I mean,

92
00:06:13,183 --> 00:06:15,170
there's no real need for it at the time being,

93
00:06:15,205 --> 00:06:16,906
this is just a virtual machine.

94
00:06:20,107 --> 00:06:22,467
Boot, boot, boot. Come on. Any time.

95
00:06:24,156 --> 00:06:28,634
Any moment now.
And there we go. So username should be "root"

96
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:31,422
and the password should be "toor".

97
00:06:35,956 --> 00:06:39,711
Let's see if this is the same
set-up as the Live Kali Linux,

98
00:06:39,946 --> 00:06:43,479
where the default password is t-o-o-r,

99
00:06:43,714 --> 00:06:46,778
in case somebody didn't hear me spell that out.

100
00:06:46,813 --> 00:06:52,308
The username is "root" and
the password is just the reverse of this.

101
00:06:52,343 --> 00:06:55,975
So "toor", that's the default set-up.

102
00:06:56,210 --> 00:06:59,848
Later on you can add in
new users, change the password, etc.

103
00:07:00,383 --> 00:07:03,004
We've got Kali. Let's see
if we can get a full screen,

104
00:07:03,050 --> 00:07:05,209
we can get a full screen! Voilà. Excellent,

105
00:07:05,244 --> 00:07:07,525
so we don't actually need to
install VirtualBox Guest Additions,

106
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,359
which is awesome, as we
don't need to go through that process.

107
00:07:13,394 --> 00:07:15,252
Let's go to the full screen like this.

108
00:07:19,518 --> 00:07:23,189
It actually doesn't go
to the full screen all the way,

109
00:07:23,224 --> 00:07:24,954
it could go a bit farther.

110
00:07:25,189 --> 00:07:28,099
This is gonna be good enough,

111
00:07:28,334 --> 00:07:33,477
I don't think there will be
a need to actually change anything.

112
00:07:35,025 --> 00:07:38,770
Actually you can stretch it out
by half a millimeter more if you'd like,

113
00:07:39,005 --> 00:07:42,508
feel free to do so, but there you go.

114
00:07:42,543 --> 00:07:47,270
Kali is installed, Kali is
up and running, it is functional

115
00:07:47,305 --> 00:07:50,172
and I don't see any problems here.

116
00:07:50,307 --> 00:07:52,001
So let's see if I have internet connectivity.

117
00:07:52,336 --> 00:07:56,500
I can type in "ping google.com", so this is stock,

118
00:07:56,535 --> 00:07:59,257
I didn't change anything. Press Enter and voilà.

119
00:07:59,292 --> 00:08:03,039
The internet does work,
I can actually successfully ping google.com.

120
00:08:05,517 --> 00:08:07,213
Let's interrupt that with Control+C

121
00:08:07,348 --> 00:08:10,394
because it's extremely
rude to leave the ping running.

122
00:08:10,429 --> 00:08:13,892
They are kind enough to allow us
to ping them to test our connection,

123
00:08:13,927 --> 00:08:17,050
so let's not waste the band
within their servers for no reason,

124
00:08:17,085 --> 00:08:19,132
just use as much as you need and that's it.

125
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:23,839
And another thing I wish
to point out is in the Devices

126
00:08:24,274 --> 00:08:28,994
you have Drag and Drop,
Shared Clipboard is more important, so

127
00:08:29,029 --> 00:08:31,842
bidirectional is enabled by default.

128
00:08:32,077 --> 00:08:34,384
Drag and Drop is also bidirectional

129
00:08:34,621 --> 00:08:37,279
but I don't really care about that
as long as the clipboard functions.

130
00:08:41,231 --> 00:08:43,274
Now, where is my Network settings? There we go.

131
00:08:43,609 --> 00:08:46,108
Go into Network and then go into Network Settings.

132
00:08:54,091 --> 00:08:56,047
It says "attached to NAT".

133
00:08:58,075 --> 00:09:00,950
NAT will pretty much mask the activity

134
00:09:00,985 --> 00:09:05,080
of your virtual machine
behind your physical machine,

135
00:09:05,315 --> 00:09:07,477
so your traffic will appear

136
00:09:07,512 --> 00:09:09,685
as though it was coming from your physical machine

137
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:13,051
but if you want Kali to be Kali

138
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:16,346
and not hide behind your
physical machine, or should I say...

139
00:09:16,381 --> 00:09:21,070
I don't like to expose
but just kind of present your

140
00:09:21,105 --> 00:09:23,625
physical machine to the rest of the world,

141
00:09:23,660 --> 00:09:27,286
you can go ahead and set it in
Bridged mode. Both modes are really fine,

142
00:09:27,321 --> 00:09:29,540
you shouldn't have problems with NAT at all.

143
00:09:29,675 --> 00:09:32,392
Some people might have
a problem with Bridged mode

144
00:09:32,527 --> 00:09:35,604
due to the drivers for the network adapters,

145
00:09:35,739 --> 00:09:37,264
but nothing I can do about it,

146
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:39,447
you can either go into
the net and try to find the drivers,

147
00:09:41,077 --> 00:09:44,085
if there are any existent,
if there are not, tough luck.

148
00:09:46,365 --> 00:09:48,726
I mean, it's fine. You can
select NAT, it's going to work.

149
00:09:48,961 --> 00:09:53,062
Let's go ahead and select the
Bridged Adapter and see if this works.

150
00:09:53,097 --> 00:09:56,263
If you don't know which
adapter you are using on Mac

151
00:09:56,298 --> 00:09:59,072
because when you select
Bridged Adapter you actually need to select

152
00:09:59,207 --> 00:10:01,835
and specify which adapter you would wish to use.

153
00:10:01,970 --> 00:10:04,431
Obviously, if you're connected to a Wi-Fi,

154
00:10:04,466 --> 00:10:06,174
you're gonna select Wi-Fi (AirPort),

155
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:08,428
or if it's Ethernet, you're gonna select Ethernet.

156
00:10:12,718 --> 00:10:15,364
If somebody has an adapter,
something like that, you can select this one.

157
00:10:17,036 --> 00:10:20,345
But if you don't know which
adapter your machine is currently using,

158
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:22,478
there's a simple fix for this.

159
00:10:27,819 --> 00:10:29,352
You can pop up your terminal.

160
00:10:30,771 --> 00:10:33,946
Let's just get out of here. Clear.

161
00:10:33,981 --> 00:10:37,225
And all you need to do is,
same as in Linux, you can...

162
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:40,020
Let's go and expand this across the whole screen.

163
00:10:40,055 --> 00:10:43,778
I hope this flashing white
color is not gonna kill your eyes.

164
00:10:44,324 --> 00:10:46,356
It probably will, I'm kidding. It's killing mine.

165
00:10:46,591 --> 00:10:49,538
You can type in "ifconfig",

166
00:10:49,873 --> 00:10:54,946
and then just search for the interface

167
00:10:55,181 --> 00:10:57,064
because these are the interface names.

168
00:10:57,399 --> 00:11:03,394
You have "en2", "en1" and you
can take a look at which interface has

169
00:11:03,529 --> 00:11:08,624
in the sign ip address, so
we're looking for an "inet". There we go,

170
00:11:08,859 --> 00:11:14,835
"en1" and we have "inet" and
then you have your LAN ip address.

171
00:11:15,170 --> 00:11:17,997
This is the LAN ip address, this is most likely...

172
00:11:18,032 --> 00:11:20,122
most of the people have pretty much the same range

173
00:11:20,157 --> 00:11:24,456
of LAN ip addresses on
their home networks and it's fine.

174
00:11:24,491 --> 00:11:26,677
I've noticed that some people in the discussions,

175
00:11:26,712 --> 00:11:30,043
they hide their LAN ip addresses

176
00:11:31,650 --> 00:11:34,830
I can't see a reason as to
why you should do that, but OK,

177
00:11:35,065 --> 00:11:37,832
feel free, it doesn't really
matter that much anyway.

178
00:11:38,167 --> 00:11:41,875
What I'm trying to say is that this LAN ip address

179
00:11:42,010 --> 00:11:44,406
doesn't really leave your network at all.

180
00:11:44,641 --> 00:11:48,337
And it most likely changes
when you reconnect the device,

181
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:50,797
as well depending on which ones are available.

182
00:11:52,978 --> 00:11:54,817
For example, if I disconnected this device

183
00:11:54,852 --> 00:11:56,935
and if I reconnected another device

184
00:11:56,970 --> 00:11:59,460
that other device
would probably have this ip address

185
00:11:59,495 --> 00:12:02,104
and then when I reconnected my Mac later on

186
00:12:03,208 --> 00:12:06,601
I would probably get 192.168.1.4.

187
00:12:08,019 --> 00:12:11,177
That's just your LAN ip
address, it's not your public ip address.

188
00:12:11,212 --> 00:12:12,916
Public ip address is something different,

189
00:12:12,951 --> 00:12:17,184
that is the ip address
that you use to go onto the net

190
00:12:17,219 --> 00:12:21,083
through your default
gateway, and that is the public one,

191
00:12:21,118 --> 00:12:26,073
that is the one that can
be used to basically trace you back.

192
00:12:27,326 --> 00:12:30,594
But this one, forget
about that, this is just a LAN ip address,

193
00:12:30,729 --> 00:12:33,099
this is something for communications

194
00:12:33,134 --> 00:12:36,114
within the LAN network and that's about it.

195
00:12:37,591 --> 00:12:39,964
Probably you didn't get
the best of explanations there,

196
00:12:40,099 --> 00:12:41,747
but well, it's not that relevant.

197
00:12:41,982 --> 00:12:45,986
This is how you'd identify
an interface which you are using.

198
00:12:46,021 --> 00:12:49,359
So when you go here in VirtualBox
and when you select the interface,

199
00:12:49,494 --> 00:12:52,481
you will select the one which
you are using to connect to the net.

200
00:12:53,818 --> 00:12:55,982
Now, all of these connections, it doesn't matter

201
00:12:56,117 --> 00:12:58,070
if you select a Wi-Fi here or an Ethernet here.

202
00:12:58,205 --> 00:13:01,721
All of these connections
will be seen by VirtualBox as

203
00:13:03,548 --> 00:13:06,678
wired connections, so none of them is actually

204
00:13:08,969 --> 00:13:12,586
your wireless.
So virtual machines do not access

205
00:13:12,721 --> 00:13:16,064
your integrated wireless
card. Let's keep that in mind.

206
00:13:16,065 --> 00:13:19,307
They will not access
your integrated wireless cards.

207
00:13:20,427 --> 00:13:23,842
In the follow up lectures
I do believe that I shall show you how

208
00:13:23,877 --> 00:13:27,639
you can effectively
pass through a USB wireless adapter

209
00:13:27,674 --> 00:13:31,559
so that you get Wi-Fi
on your virtual machine as well.

210
00:13:31,694 --> 00:13:34,942
But that is for another lecture, so allow all here.

211
00:13:37,847 --> 00:13:39,966
By the way, if you power your machine off

212
00:13:40,001 --> 00:13:42,128
you can change your MAC address here

213
00:13:42,263 --> 00:13:44,622
because MAC changes
don't work on a virtual machine.

214
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:47,031
So you can just change your MAC address here

215
00:13:47,066 --> 00:13:50,440
by pressing this circle here. OK. Nevermind.

216
00:13:50,575 --> 00:13:53,340
We've switched to
Bridged Adapter, saving settings, OK.

217
00:13:53,375 --> 00:13:56,982
I'm in the software, let's type in the password.

218
00:13:58,815 --> 00:14:03,128
Let's go and try to ping google.com. No ping.

219
00:14:03,163 --> 00:14:06,291
It's not passing through, OK,
no big deal. Let's type in "ifconfig".

220
00:14:06,526 --> 00:14:09,785
I do have already assigned an ip address

221
00:14:09,820 --> 00:14:11,831
and I did not released the DHCP list,

222
00:14:11,866 --> 00:14:15,031
I did not release this
ip address on this interface.

223
00:14:16,083 --> 00:14:17,754
So let's go ahead and release it.

224
00:14:21,199 --> 00:14:24,302
Several ways of doing this
but I'm just gonna go ahead and type in

225
00:14:24,637 --> 00:14:32,197
"service network-manager restart".

226
00:14:34,169 --> 00:14:36,244
And then type in "ifconfig" and you see

227
00:14:36,379 --> 00:14:38,728
I have a completely different ip address now,

228
00:14:39,063 --> 00:14:43,746
that one was from NAT
and this one is on the LAN network.

229
00:14:43,981 --> 00:14:48,351
So I just go and type in "ping google.com"

230
00:14:48,386 --> 00:14:50,303
and voilà, it worked.

231
00:14:50,538 --> 00:14:53,517
So both Bridged and
NAT, they're working just fine.

232
00:14:53,752 --> 00:14:57,540
This is a first install on a Mac from 2011.

233
00:15:00,397 --> 00:15:03,241
That should be it for these
lectures. Now we're gonna move on to

234
00:15:05,335 --> 00:15:07,745
continuing this set-up on a Mac and doing

235
00:15:08,407 --> 00:15:11,371
everything that you need to do
to actually be able to sit back and relax

236
00:15:11,506 --> 00:15:14,846
and follow through
this course as comfortably as you can.

237
00:15:15,824 --> 00:15:18,298
Until then, I would like to bid you all farewell

238
00:15:18,333 --> 00:15:20,976
and I sincerely hope
that this was extremely useful

239
00:15:21,011 --> 00:15:23,249
to all the Mac users out there.
