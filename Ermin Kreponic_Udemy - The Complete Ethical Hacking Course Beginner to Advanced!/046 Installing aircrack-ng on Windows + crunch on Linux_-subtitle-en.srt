00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,400
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02,400 --> 00:00:07,600
Today I will show you briefly how you can install aircrack in Windows.

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,500
So go ahead and start up your windows

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,299
but this is not a good idea, just gonna go ahead and say it out of the box.

5
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:18,200
Not something you actually want to do.

6
00:00:18,200 --> 00:00:21,500
So I already have it installed here and this is how it looks like.

7
00:00:21,500 --> 00:00:24,100
I'm just gonna go ahead and close it to show you what you need to.

8
00:00:24,100 --> 00:00:33,900
First off, you need to go ahead and go to the website called www.aircrack-ng.org and download the file

9
00:00:33,900 --> 00:00:35,800
and that's pretty much it.

10
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,800
After you download it, unzip it and it will work.

11
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,000
So let's just go ahead and click on it. It's right there.

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,200
I'm gonna use my unzipping program, so it's 7 zip.

13
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:51,000
It doesn't belong to me, it's just one that I have chosen to use

14
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:52,400
but you can use WinRAR

15
00:00:52,400 --> 00:00:56,449
or pretty much anything else that you have available.

16
00:00:56,449 --> 00:01:02,500
I'm gonna go ahead and select aircrack -ng ,extract it, select the folder to extract it

17
00:01:02,500 --> 00:01:07,500
I'm gonna say desktop. I have already extracted it twice there.

18
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:09,200
Yes to all. Copy over it.

19
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:12,800
It's not going to ask you this question because you're not going to have it there

20
00:01:12,800 --> 00:01:14,010
and there we go.

21
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:16,500
It is successfully extracted to desktop.

22
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:19,850
As I said previously, there is no installation procedure whatsoever.

23
00:01:19,850 --> 00:01:22,200
This is the folder that I am moving about.

24
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:29,400
Just go ahead and open it, select bin, and it says aircrack -ng gui/exit

25
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:31,000
That is the one that you need.

26
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:32,000
Excellent

27
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,200
and here we have the tool works, it's right here.

28
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,700
You don't need to install anything.

29
00:01:36,700 --> 00:01:40,000
You didn't need to go through a lengthy procedures or anything of the kind.

30
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,439
You have three programs here...

31
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:49,000
You actually have four of them, but we're not going to be using these two for the time being.

32
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,300
You have airdump -ng and aircrack -ng

33
00:01:52,300 --> 00:01:55,100
airdump is used for collecting information

34
00:01:55,100 --> 00:02:01,900
and you use aircrack -ng in order to brute force the password

35
00:02:01,900 --> 00:02:04,600
or brute force the encryption, should Isay.

36
00:02:04,600 --> 00:02:07,000
Now as I said, I do not recommended this.

37
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:10,300
If you really wish to use Windows, here is how you can do it.

38
00:02:10,300 --> 00:02:11,760
Here's how you can use it.

39
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,800
Other than that, I really really don't recommend it.

40
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:20,000
and now we're going to switch back to our Linux

41
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,620
and here we will see what else do we need.

42
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:25,200
So one of the primary problems that we will encounter

43
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:31,000
is the fact that we were unable to generate vast amount of passwords manually, of course.

44
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:36,920
Ever try typing in a million passwords manually? Not gonna work.

45
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:41,300
So one of the first things that we need here is our crunch

46
00:02:41,300 --> 00:02:48,400
which is a piece of code, a software, which we will use in order to generate password lists.

47
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:51,400
It's very flexible and easy to use.

48
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:56,400
We can state how many characters

49
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:02,200
do we want our passwords to have from what link to what link

50
00:03:02,200 --> 00:03:05,300
is the possibilities like minimal and maximal length of the password

51
00:03:05,300 --> 00:03:08,000
and if we know fractions of the password

52
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,500
we can even use those fractions and insert them.

53
00:03:11,500 --> 00:03:16,500
Before we can do any of those things, we first need to go and download crunch.

54
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,600
Crunch is available on sourceforge.net

55
00:03:19,600 --> 00:03:26,900
Just type in "crunch password generator"

56
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:30,800
and here, we will get the link for SourceForge

57
00:03:30,800 --> 00:03:31,500
Excellent

58
00:03:31,500 --> 00:03:35,000
Just go ahead and download this.

59
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:42,000
Your download will start in few seconds, and the whole download process will last a few seconds.

60
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,370
Just go ahead and save the file.

61
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,000
Let's just open it up.

62
00:03:47,000 --> 00:03:48,700
We will need to extract it.

63
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:51,500
Just use a default extractor, it's as simple as that.

64
00:03:51,500 --> 00:03:52,300
Choose a folder

65
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,000
I'm gonna go ahead and pick desktop

66
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:59,300
primarily because I'm gonna delete it later, as I already have it installed and configured.

67
00:03:59,300 --> 00:04:01,400
There we go. That's done.

68
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,600
It finishes up really fast. You don't even have the time to see what's going on.

69
00:04:06,600 --> 00:04:08,940
So let's just go ahead and close these things.

70
00:04:08,940 --> 00:04:09,800
Excellent

71
00:04:09,800 --> 00:04:11,200
So crunch is here.

72
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:17,300
If I opt to open it, there are some things in here which we will attempt to use later
on

73
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,100
but I will explain them once we actually start using them.

74
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:24,000
For the time being, I just wanted to show you how to install it.

75
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:30,200
Let's go ahead and open up our terminal, navigate over to the folder where it is located

76
00:04:30,200 --> 00:04:34,900
So "cd /home/Chronic/Desktop/crunch"

77
00:04:34,900 --> 00:04:37,010
Excellent

78
00:04:37,010 --> 00:04:41,400
You don't have an instruction here on how to do it, but you see there is a Makefile

79
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,200
and whenever there's a Makefile, just have in "make"

80
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:50,900
You do need to be root or have a psuedo password.

81
00:04:50,900 --> 00:04:51,870
So just type in "make"

82
00:04:51,870 --> 00:04:53,000
Excellent

83
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,400
There we go That has passed.

84
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,250
"make install" press ENTER again, and there we go.

85
00:04:59,250 --> 00:05:12,000
You have the installation process done and ready to go.

86
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:14,180
Crunch now installed.

87
00:05:14,180 --> 00:05:17,600
you can see the main pages for it are functional

88
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,370
and this is the syntax.

89
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:22,300
You would type in one number here and another number here.

90
00:05:22,300 --> 00:05:25,000
The minimal and maximal length.

91
00:05:25,000 --> 00:05:26,700
Character set here

92
00:05:26,700 --> 00:05:29,400
You could type them in manually or use predefined ones

93
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,500
then you can pass a ton load of other options if you wish.

94
00:05:33,500 --> 00:05:37,700
You don't need to actually read through all of this, but skim through it.

95
00:05:37,700 --> 00:05:39,000
Just scroll through it.

96
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:45,000
See what parts you can catch and see it they are of any use to you

97
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:52,000
but I assure you in the later tutorials

98
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:55,510
as we will be using crunch, for example, in this fashion.

99
00:05:55,510 --> 00:06:01,000
So let me just go ahead clear the screen, type in "crunch"

100
00:06:01,000 --> 00:06:09,000
and then I will tell it to generate a certain length, let's say from three to nine.

101
00:06:09,000 --> 00:06:13,000
I've seen people taken from zero to like nine.

102
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:16,200
So you can exclude zero immediately, but it doesn't do any harm

103
00:06:16,200 --> 00:06:18,000
It doesn't actually take away that much time.

104
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,000
Let's just type in from three to, I don't know, five

105
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:31,270
and now I can pass in, I'm gonna say "abcd123"

106
00:06:31,270 --> 00:06:41,500
and now I can pipe this to "aircrack -ng"

107
00:06:41,500 --> 00:06:48,000
and all the passwords that are generated here will be passed to aircrack -ng and will be used immediately.

108
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,000
I need add a few more commands here, of course, and that I will do in the next tutorial

109
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:54,500
but I just anted to explain the significance of this

110
00:06:54,500 --> 00:06:57,310
because let's say I do this --

111
00:06:57,310 --> 00:07:03,000
3 to 5, press ENTER, and I'm gonna cancel it before it manages to finish.

112
00:07:03,000 --> 00:07:10,200
It says "Crunch will now generate the following amount of data:  7680 bytes aids"

113
00:07:10,200 --> 00:07:11,500
That's nothing

114
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:18,000
It says this is the amount of passwords is going to generate -- 1344

115
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:18,900
Not a big deal

116
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:22,000
Okay, let's try something else.

117
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:37,200
Let's try "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", press ENTER

118
00:07:37,200 --> 00:07:39,200
Look at what happens --

119
00:07:39,200 --> 00:07:47,000
The file size has grown exponentially, the amount of possible combinations have grown exponentially

120
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,200
and it says 1770 MB

121
00:07:49,200 --> 00:07:51,110
But this is a very small password.

122
00:07:51,110 --> 00:07:53,200
This is gonna get cracked in a couple of seconds.

123
00:07:53,200 --> 00:07:56,000
This is no big deal.

124
00:07:56,000 --> 00:08:02,000
How about if I specify the length of nine?

125
00:08:02,000 --> 00:08:08,600
Just look at what happens -- It says that it has 51 TB of data

126
00:08:08,600 --> 00:08:12,000
and this is how many possible combinations there will be.

127
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,100
Okay, this is a very large number

128
00:08:15,100 --> 00:08:19,800
and with my CPU, it will take me a very long amount of time to do that

129
00:08:19,800 --> 00:08:24,000
but not a reasonable amount of time, in any case.

130
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,670
It says 51 TB -- That's a lot

131
00:08:26,670 --> 00:08:35,430
Okay, let's go ahead and type in "1234567890" and see what happens.

132
00:08:35,430 --> 00:08:44,400
It says almost 1000 TB from 51, just by adding numbers from 0 to 9

133
00:08:44,400 --> 00:08:48,300
You get where I'm doing with this

134
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:55,000
but let's say that I type in here, I don't know, 29

135
00:08:55,000 --> 00:09:03,000
Basically it tells me that will generate 6998 PB of data.

136
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:09,000
You are simply not gonna have enough room on your hard drives.

137
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:10,800
It doesn't really matter how big they are.

138
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,300
You're not going to have a single PB of storage in your house

139
00:09:14,300 --> 00:09:24,000
A PB of storage is 1000 TB, so that's a lot and you're not gonna have it in your house.

140
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,000
You see, what you would do with aircrack generally is...

141
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:29,600
I'm just gonna explain why this is important

142
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,000
"aircrack -ng -w"

143
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:40,000
and then you would passwordlist.txt file to it

144
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,000
in order to crack a certain file with it.

145
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:49,300
However, these password lists, as long as they are as good as they are

146
00:09:49,300 --> 00:09:54,000
they do not guarantee that the password will be cracked

147
00:09:54,000 --> 00:10:00,800
and you cannot generate this amount of information with this many combinations

148
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:03,000
and put them in a file on your local computer

149
00:10:03,000 --> 00:10:07,000
and if you put it in a cloud somewhere, it's going to cost a ridiculous amount of money

150
00:10:07,000 --> 00:10:16,000
What you can do, however, is pass an argument -- "-w -"

151
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:29,200
and I'm just gonna use my previous command -- "aircrack -ng -w -"

152
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:30,400
Excellent

153
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:34,000
So now, crunch will not save these things.

154
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:37,800
They will simply go to standard output

155
00:10:37,800 --> 00:10:43,800
and aircrack will pick them up from standard output and utilize them

156
00:10:43,800 --> 00:10:48,900
in order to basically break the encryption of a capture file

157
00:10:48,900 --> 00:10:51,300
that we will later on capture as well.

158
00:10:51,300 --> 00:10:54,530
So this was just an example, a post installation example

159
00:10:54,530 --> 00:10:59,000
and explanation of why we needed to install crunch.

160
00:10:59,000 --> 00:11:02,600
There's also way...I've seen it somewhere in the net

161
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:07,800
but I haven't managed to find a safe place to download crunch for Windows from the net

162
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:11,000
therefore I have opted not to actually show you that

163
00:11:11,000 --> 00:11:13,500
due to safety reasons

164
00:11:13,500 --> 00:11:16,400
but it is possible to do it in Windows.

165
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,200
Again, not recommended at all.

166
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,000
In any case, I bid you farewell until the next tutorial.

167
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,500
In the next tutorial, I will start with the cracking process

168
00:11:28,500 --> 00:11:34,000
and you will see how we can actually crack a genuine wifi.
