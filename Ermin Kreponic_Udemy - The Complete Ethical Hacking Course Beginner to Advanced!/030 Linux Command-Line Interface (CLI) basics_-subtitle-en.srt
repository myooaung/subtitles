00:00:00,599 --> 00:00:06,750
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.
Today, I will go over a few basic commands

2
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:11,790
you will need in order to follow this course
through. There are four basic commands that

3
00:00:11,790 --> 00:00:19,110
are used in order to navigate within the terminal,
or through the file system, to figure out

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:25,490
where you are at the moment, to copy things,
move things, get listings of files, folders,

5
00:00:25,490 --> 00:00:31,340
see the contents, remove them, change the
ownership of files or change the modes of

6
00:00:31,340 --> 00:00:37,719
files. You will see shortly what I mean. First
off, we have "cd" which is change directories.

7
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:45,670
If I just type in cd/home, I am going to navigate
over to my home directory. So, "cd" stands

8
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:52,079
for change directory. As I said before, you
are literally changing your working directory.

9
00:00:52,079 --> 00:01:01,969
If you type in "cd.." you will always go one
step back. So ".." is always the previous

10
00:01:01,969 --> 00:01:10,100
folder. It's a shortcut you will use fairly
often. Next up, we have "ls." "Ls" shows you

11
00:01:10,100 --> 00:01:17,820
the listing off the current folder contents.
You can also use, for example, "ls /home/"

12
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:24,560
and you get the listing of a specified folder
as well. Typing "ls" in and of its own give

13
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:29,799
you the listing of the current folder, as
opposed to typing "ls" and then a path to

14
00:01:29,799 --> 00:01:35,039
a folder, which will give you a listing for
a specified folder. In addition to that, you

15
00:01:35,039 --> 00:01:41,450
also have "ls - l" which will give you a long
listing. That will tell you who the owners

16
00:01:41,450 --> 00:01:50,649
are, the size, the date, the type, the permissions
and so on and so forth. However, one of the

17
00:01:50,649 --> 00:01:58,770
more common usages of "ls" is "ls - la" to
show the hidden files as well. You might notice

18
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:06,719
that I am not using "ll" like I generally
use in Fedora. It goes "- ll" command not

19
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:11,690
found. I guess I could install it here as
well, but it doesn't really matter. It performs

20
00:02:11,690 --> 00:02:18,060
a fairly similar function as "ls" does, but
it's a bit faster to type in. Now I'm just

21
00:02:18,060 --> 00:02:23,530
going to go ahead and clear this. Next up,
is "pwd" which prints working directory. Some

22
00:02:23,530 --> 00:02:31,940
of you may find it confusing, but / in all
Linux-like systems simply refers to the root

23
00:02:31,940 --> 00:02:40,050
directory, to the beginning. To the root directory
from where all the files are located and from

24
00:02:40,050 --> 00:02:47,300
where everything begins. Let me just make
it clear. I'm going to navigate over to home,

25
00:02:47,300 --> 00:02:53,470
and then use "pwd." You can see that I am
in home at the moment. So, print working directory

26
00:02:53,470 --> 00:03:01,060
does exactly what the name itself says, it
prints your current working directory. Next

27
00:03:01,060 --> 00:03:08,840
up, we have our "cp" command, which we already
used in order to copy VirtualBox guest additions

28
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:20,060
from one place to another. It's fairly simple.
You type in "cp /path" -- Let's do a real

29
00:03:20,060 --> 00:03:30,450
example. So, if I, for example, go ahead and
type in "cp VBoxLinuxAdditions.run," and if

30
00:03:30,450 --> 00:03:36,920
I want to copy it to somewhere, let's say
that I wish to copy it to "/var/". I will

31
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:52,240
delete, of course, I will show you how to
do that as well, but it's fairly simple. You

32
00:03:52,240 --> 00:03:57,960
specify what you want to copy and where you
want to copy it to. Keep in mind, you could

33
00:03:57,960 --> 00:04:04,090
have actually typed in here a folder, a full
path, to this VirtualBoxguestadditions.run.

34
00:04:04,090 --> 00:04:11,130
You don't actually need to be in the home
directory. This "-v" option gives us this.

35
00:04:11,130 --> 00:04:17,380
It tells us what was copied where. It's a
very useful option. Let me show you what would

36
00:04:17,380 --> 00:04:24,040
happen if I didn't have that. Just like this,
you see nothing. There is no output or anything

37
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:29,970
of the kind. This is this is fairly simple.
When you have one very small file and you

38
00:04:29,970 --> 00:04:36,120
don't really care, but when you will have
a large file, let's say it's 20GB or so, you

39
00:04:36,120 --> 00:04:41,650
are copying you'll just have a blank screen
below. Nothing will be happening. You will

40
00:04:41,650 --> 00:04:49,260
not be able to figure out whether the copying
process is going on or if it has actually

41
00:04:49,260 --> 00:04:57,280
crashed, bugged or something of a kind. Just
pass the "-v" option which is always useful

42
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,460
to have simply because the machine actually
tells you what it is doing. Now, you might've

43
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,470
noticed that all of these commands, more or
less, have their own arguments, which can

44
00:05:06,470 --> 00:05:11,720
be passed to them in order to modify what
the command does. You can view a listing of

45
00:05:11,720 --> 00:05:18,660
these arguments. You do not need to memorize
them all. So, let's take an example of "cp

46
00:05:18,660 --> 00:05:24,960
--help." This is a universal way of getting
help on the subject within the terminal. You

47
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:31,630
type in the command, a space, then "--help,"
press enter and you get a listing of possibilities.

48
00:05:31,630 --> 00:05:35,910
So, I know it looks a bit messy and a bit
difficult to see, but you don't actually need

49
00:05:35,910 --> 00:05:41,210
to look at all of these things here. Just
scroll upwards and there you go. You can see

50
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:48,720
all the arguments. They are listed clearly
here. You have the argument here, and an explanation

51
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,520
of what that argument does. For the time being,
you're not going to be able to memorize all

52
00:05:54,520 --> 00:06:04,160
of these. Over time, as you practice more,
and start actually is using these commands,

53
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:10,320
you will be remembering more, and more, and
more, and more, without actually wish it.

54
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:17,450
Basically it will be caching the information,
so to say. Anyway, over here, in the upper

55
00:06:17,450 --> 00:06:24,950
part of this help menu you got usage. In usage,
you get the format or the syntax of the command.

56
00:06:24,950 --> 00:06:33,430
So basically, "cp" option, and then you specify
your source and destination. Very simple,

57
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:38,280
no problems there. This is universal for all
of the commands, you can always use the help

58
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:46,860
menu. However, in addition to the help menu,
you also have man pages. So if I type in man,

59
00:06:46,860 --> 00:06:57,620
and I can use the command "pwd." The man pages
on "pwd" give me a ton of information. You

60
00:06:57,620 --> 00:07:04,020
can see it gives you the name. It's called
synopsis here, but basically the syntax of

61
00:07:04,020 --> 00:07:09,520
the command. You get a full description of
what the command does, a full description

62
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:16,900
of the arguments, you even get the author
who actually wrote, some notes, copyright

63
00:07:16,900 --> 00:07:26,139
and some references to something else as well.
This is a very short man page because "pwd"

64
00:07:26,139 --> 00:07:38,240
is a very short, basic command. For example,
if I was to type in, "man grep," you can see

65
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:46,550
that the man page is a lot bigger. I'm just
scrolling down and it seems to go on. "Grep"

66
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:51,120
is a multipurpose command which I'll show
to you in a moment. I just wanted to show

67
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:57,270
the difference between a basic and a more
complex command. Let me just go ahead and

68
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:06,550
clear the screen. Next up, we have move so,
"mv." That will cause a folder to move. This

69
00:08:06,550 --> 00:08:13,120
is how you rename folders too, or files. So
just go ahead and navigate over to "var,"

70
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:24,760
where I have actually copied this file. Excellent.
If I type, "mv VBoxLinuxAdditions. I can move

71
00:08:24,760 --> 00:08:32,689
to some different folder, under some different
name, or I can just rename it within my current

72
00:08:32,689 --> 00:08:52,779
folder. If I just type 
it in "RandomIsNotSoRandom." I'm just going
to rename it to that. Say ".run." You can

73
00:08:52,779 --> 00:08:57,459
put whatever extension you want. Of course,
it won't function the same. I am just showing

74
00:08:57,459 --> 00:09:05,639
you the way of renaming files. if I do "ls"
again, you see, that VboxLinuxadditions.run

75
00:09:05,639 --> 00:09:15,730
has been successfully renamed to RandomIsNotSoRandom.run.
I can also do this. I can RandomIsNotSoRandom

76
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:22,800
to my home directory. If I do "ls," specify
a path to my home directory and press enter,

77
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:28,610
you see that I've actually moved it here.
Unlike the copy command, it doesn't retain

78
00:09:28,610 --> 00:09:40,589
the original within wherever the source might
have been. So, once you move it, it's gone

79
00:09:40,589 --> 00:09:47,809
from the source folder, however, it's going
to appear in the destination one. Also tricky

80
00:09:47,809 --> 00:09:53,199
one: when you delete something with move,
when you move something over something else,

81
00:09:53,199 --> 00:10:00,379
it's so difficult to recover, if not impossible.
Also, be very careful with deleting files

82
00:10:00,379 --> 00:10:10,129
in Linux. Once you delete them from the terminal,
you will not be able to recover them. There

83
00:10:10,129 --> 00:10:17,619
are some complex procedures that might give
you a fraction of what you wanted to recover.

84
00:10:17,619 --> 00:10:21,959
If you remove it from the terminal. It's very,
very, very difficult. It's not like Windows

85
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:26,029
or something. When you delete something in
Windows, you can always recover. It's like

86
00:10:26,029 --> 00:10:33,869
you basically didn't delete it. You just don't
see it. But here, when you delete something

87
00:10:33,869 --> 00:10:43,309
it's gone permanently. So take great caution,
take care but don't be afraid. I mean, over

88
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:50,309
time, these things become second nature to
you. You will take it into consideration without

89
00:10:50,309 --> 00:11:02,839
even thinking about it. I'll go ahead and
clear the screen. Next up, we have "cat."

90
00:11:02,839 --> 00:11:19,110
Let's navigate home. Let's type "cat RandomIsNotSoRandom."
You see what it does. It actually shows you--

91
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:29,089
this is a bit of a longer file-- all the contents
of that file, whatever that might be. This

92
00:11:29,089 --> 00:11:34,050
content is not pretty at all. You can't read
it like this, but doesn't matter. Let's just

93
00:11:34,050 --> 00:11:44,999
create another file. So, nano is my favorite
text editor from the terminal. You will need

94
00:11:44,999 --> 00:11:50,869
to learn how to use the terminal text editors
because you don't want to be switching back

95
00:11:50,869 --> 00:11:58,989
and forth between GUI text editors and working
on something a terminal. It's extremely time-consuming.

96
00:11:58,989 --> 00:12:05,029
Here on Kali Linux, you can actually edit
things with root. However, if you are using

97
00:12:05,029 --> 00:12:09,759
some other distribution or something of a
kind, most of the GUI text editors will not

98
00:12:09,759 --> 00:12:15,899
be able to run as root. You will get an error
message. So that can be a bit problematic.

99
00:12:15,899 --> 00:12:21,639
That's why you should always learn how to
use text editors that are terminal text editors.

100
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,410
Just type in "nano" and type in the name of
the file you wish to create. For example,

101
00:12:27,410 --> 00:12:33,720
I'm just going to go ahead and type in "test."
Since this is a test file no need to give

102
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,619
it any extensions or anything of the kind.
There we go, we are in the nano text editor.

103
00:12:39,619 --> 00:13:03,290
So here I can write some text, "Some random
text goes here." You have a variety of options.

104
00:13:03,290 --> 00:13:10,639
This carrot sign, "^X" simply means control-X.
If you press control-x you are going to exit.

105
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:17,300
Control-O, write out, that's basically save.
You don't need this. where is, is basically

106
00:13:17,300 --> 00:13:24,920
how you search things. Hit control-V to search.
Let's look for "random" press enter and there

107
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:31,489
you go. It's going to point to random. It
found it, no problems. Previous page don't

108
00:13:31,489 --> 00:13:37,129
need and the next page we are not going to
be that engaged with it. So cut text is also

109
00:13:37,129 --> 00:13:43,809
very nice. It allows you to actually remove
large portions of text at a relatively fast

110
00:13:43,809 --> 00:13:49,249
rate. So if I just say control-K, it's going
to remove the current line where the cursor

111
00:13:49,249 --> 00:13:56,449
is, not what you have selected with your mouse.
Just so you know. Let me just bring that back.

112
00:13:56,449 --> 00:14:01,579
I'm just going to go ahead and continue talking
about this in part two, in the following tutorial.

113
00:14:01,579 --> 00:14:03,589
Until then, I bid you farewell.
