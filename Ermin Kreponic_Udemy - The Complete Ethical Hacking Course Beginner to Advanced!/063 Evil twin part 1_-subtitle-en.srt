1
00:00:02,050 --> 00:00:04,300
Hello everybody and
welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:07,360
Today, I will show you
the evil twin method.

3
00:00:07,360 --> 00:00:12,150
This will complement a lot of other things
along the way, not only that which will

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:17,131
come later, but also it complements
that which we've already done,

5
00:00:17,131 --> 00:00:24,560
primarily because evil twin allows
you to steal all sorts of traffic.

6
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,780
Now, you are effectively with this method
what you are doing, you are cloning

7
00:00:28,780 --> 00:00:33,640
the wireless access point and then all
the clients that are authenticated to that

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:39,990
access can get deauthenticated and the
next time they automatically reconnect,

9
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:43,880
it will reconnect back to you should
your signal strength be stronger.

10
00:00:44,940 --> 00:00:49,410
Now, the issue with signal strengths,
you are able to boost the signal strength

11
00:00:49,410 --> 00:00:53,440
on your own of you are using Linux and
of you have proper drivers.

12
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:59,100
It wont work on all wireless network
cards but you can always get an external

13
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,310
antenna for your laptop, a USB wireless
antenna or something of a kind.

14
00:01:04,310 --> 00:01:09,563
I do believe they cost maybe,
you get a wireless network card that

15
00:01:09,563 --> 00:01:14,926
goes over a USB and then that
wireless network card has an antenna.

16
00:01:14,926 --> 00:01:18,020
They, I think you can get one for
20 bucks, something like that.

17
00:01:18,020 --> 00:01:19,190
They're pretty cheap.

18
00:01:19,190 --> 00:01:22,100
Make sure that they're
compatible in terms of drivers.

19
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:28,039
And your signal can be a lot stronger
than anybody else that is nearby, or

20
00:01:28,039 --> 00:01:30,785
you can simply come close to somewhere.

21
00:01:30,785 --> 00:01:34,679
You can go, if you were in a bar or
something like that,

22
00:01:34,679 --> 00:01:39,849
your signal should always be stronger for
people that are closer to you,

23
00:01:39,849 --> 00:01:45,230
unless they have crazy good wi-fi
system in a bar or something of a kind.

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:49,190
Also useful in companies or
something like that while people.

25
00:01:49,190 --> 00:01:52,870
This has been known,
people have been doing this.

26
00:01:52,870 --> 00:01:54,840
They go into a lobby.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:57,000
And they're waiting for something.

28
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,870
And they have a laptop that's in
their bag or something like that,

29
00:01:59,870 --> 00:02:03,510
and that laptop is working while
they're waiting for somebody.

30
00:02:03,510 --> 00:02:06,580
So they're not suspicious at all or
anything of a kind.

31
00:02:06,580 --> 00:02:10,620
And especially if you have
a hundred people in a huge lobby or

32
00:02:10,620 --> 00:02:13,760
something of a kind,
you will practically be invisible and

33
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,080
be able to take a lot of
information that way.

34
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:20,900
However, you will face the problem
of encryption once again.

35
00:02:20,900 --> 00:02:25,110
But encryption is,
we are not doing this for

36
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:29,760
the sake of perhaps cracking
the GPA2 passkey because it can be

37
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:32,090
cracked in this way through
a little bit of social engineering.

38
00:02:32,090 --> 00:02:36,200
But you can also,
what you can also do here is

39
00:02:38,140 --> 00:02:39,800
play around with people's information.

40
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:42,920
So, play around with their URL, HTTP,

41
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:48,360
Get requests and
you can modify their net queries.

42
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,330
Also, you are in control of
what gets served to them.

43
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,160
So you can control the content that gets
served to them primarily because you can

44
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,140
alter the DNS servers.

45
00:02:58,140 --> 00:03:03,130
And if you alter DNS servers,
you can have customized MX records, or

46
00:03:03,130 --> 00:03:03,830
something of a kind.

47
00:03:03,830 --> 00:03:08,275
What this allows you to do is say that

48
00:03:08,275 --> 00:03:14,350
Facebook.com will be resolved through some
other IP address than the official one.

49
00:03:14,350 --> 00:03:19,040
So, to whatever server you want, you can
redirect the traffic, which is fantastic.

50
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:21,570
Because you can clone a Facebook page.

51
00:03:21,570 --> 00:03:24,410
I'm just specifying Facebook
as an example here.

52
00:03:24,410 --> 00:03:26,490
This can be done for any other site.

53
00:03:26,490 --> 00:03:31,520
And this is practically a foolproof way or
getting credentials for

54
00:03:31,520 --> 00:03:35,770
any site at all by
changing the DNS servers.

55
00:03:35,770 --> 00:03:41,300
And if you configure the DNS servers
in a router or on a PC somewhere or

56
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:46,000
on a network somewhere, you will be
able to give them your own DNS servers.

57
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,730
And your own DNS servers will point
the users in very specific directions.

58
00:03:50,730 --> 00:03:54,220
They will point them to the cloned
websites that you will clone, and

59
00:03:54,220 --> 00:03:56,050
that you will host on
your Apache web server.

60
00:03:56,050 --> 00:04:01,490
And once they type their credentials in,
they will be yours for

61
00:04:01,490 --> 00:04:05,070
the taking,
which can be extremely painful.

62
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:09,032
So let's say they make
a query to a website,

63
00:04:09,032 --> 00:04:13,218
they try to login,
login will fail of course.

64
00:04:13,218 --> 00:04:15,661
But you will get their credentials.

65
00:04:15,661 --> 00:04:19,249
And as soon as you get their credentials,
you can redirect traffic elsewhere, or

66
00:04:19,249 --> 00:04:20,972
something like that, to a legit page.

67
00:04:20,972 --> 00:04:23,940
There are limitless options here.

68
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:28,390
There is lot of things which you can do,
that people tend to do in real life,

69
00:04:28,390 --> 00:04:31,910
and lot of accounts get stolen this way.

70
00:04:31,910 --> 00:04:35,900
However, DNS attacks, and all of that,
we will do a little bit later.

71
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:39,190
For the time being, I just want to show
you how you can control, how you can

72
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:46,650
clone a MAC, clone a wireless access point
and redirect all traffic to yourself.

73
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:50,300
And there with have a good
measure of control over it.

74
00:04:51,670 --> 00:04:55,940
Anyway we're gonna be using one of
Aircrack's tools that is Airbase.

75
00:04:55,940 --> 00:05:00,170
I have the command listed down below.

76
00:05:00,170 --> 00:05:02,330
Here let me just zoom it in.

77
00:05:02,330 --> 00:05:09,490
So we're gonna need air base,
which will be our tool use for cloning.

78
00:05:09,490 --> 00:05:11,230
And down below I have air play- NG.

79
00:05:11,230 --> 00:05:15,740
We have used that before for
DL authentication.

80
00:05:15,740 --> 00:05:17,670
Anyway, let's just go ahead and
proceed with this.

81
00:05:17,670 --> 00:05:23,256
The first thing that we need to do,
of course,

82
00:05:23,256 --> 00:05:27,410
is we'll scan to see where we are,

83
00:05:27,410 --> 00:05:30,993
what's in our environment,

84
00:05:30,993 --> 00:05:35,576
what sort of Mac addresses do we have,

85
00:05:35,576 --> 00:05:40,589
what sort of access points do we have, and

86
00:05:40,589 --> 00:05:46,175
in order to do that,
we need monitoring mode,

87
00:05:46,175 --> 00:05:51,475
as always, so I have config, wlp2s0 down

88
00:05:51,475 --> 00:05:56,780
iwconfig wlp2s0 mode monitor airmon-ng

89
00:05:56,780 --> 00:06:01,797
check wlp2s0, kill network manager,

90
00:06:01,797 --> 00:06:06,440
we'll do that one first, 4734.

91
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:11,790
And then I need to kill,
ooh, I have dhcclients.

92
00:06:11,790 --> 00:06:18,150
Need to kill that, too, 30664, okay.

93
00:06:18,150 --> 00:06:19,391
That one died already.

94
00:06:19,391 --> 00:06:26,982
Let's see, 11, 2,8,9, excellent.

95
00:06:26,982 --> 00:06:31,950
So let's perform a check now,
okay I'm gonna leave these running

96
00:06:31,950 --> 00:06:35,420
I'm pretty sure that they won't interfere.

97
00:06:35,420 --> 00:06:37,006
Now the commands that I've
typed in now I'm not gonna

98
00:06:37,006 --> 00:06:39,098
explain them in detail they
are explained in the previous tutorials.

99
00:06:39,098 --> 00:06:44,484
Now we're gonna go ahead and
do some scanning so,

100
00:06:44,484 --> 00:06:51,155
airodump-ng and just oops,
[NOISE] airodump-ng vlp2s0,

101
00:06:51,155 --> 00:06:57,199
press enter and
there we go there's a scan in progress.

102
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,255
I'm gonna wait,
I'm not gonna hold the scan here.

103
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:07,261
This is my wireless
access point something,

104
00:07:07,261 --> 00:07:11,353
as before it's pretty strong here.

105
00:07:11,353 --> 00:07:13,537
I'm gonna have to move
it to the next room or

106
00:07:13,537 --> 00:07:16,578
something like that in order to
get a bit of a better signal.

107
00:07:16,578 --> 00:07:20,748
I'm gonna connect a device to and
down below we're gonna see a jump.

108
00:07:20,748 --> 00:07:21,955
That doesn't really matter.

109
00:07:21,955 --> 00:07:23,993
That's not what we are after.

110
00:07:23,993 --> 00:07:27,325
We just need to clone it, but
down below you have all of these

111
00:07:27,325 --> 00:07:32,170
authenticated clients to the stations,
and it zoomed this out to show them all.

112
00:07:32,170 --> 00:07:33,631
There's quite a bit of them.

113
00:07:36,703 --> 00:07:38,740
And there we go.

114
00:07:38,740 --> 00:07:40,465
They seem to be authenticated.

115
00:07:40,465 --> 00:07:44,720
I'm pretty sure this time that my device
is one of these, doesn't really matter.

116
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:46,930
I just wanted to connect it.

117
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:51,515
Anyway, now that we have all
this information from the scan,

118
00:07:51,515 --> 00:07:56,450
we're going to go ahead and
take the Mac address, just go ahead and

119
00:07:56,450 --> 00:07:59,201
copy it, and type in the following.

120
00:07:59,201 --> 00:08:02,065
Air, okay, let's just clear the screen.

121
00:08:02,065 --> 00:08:03,860
Wait, I can't clear the screen,
I need the information.

122
00:08:05,930 --> 00:08:07,010
Let me just zoom it in.

123
00:08:07,010 --> 00:08:10,830
So, air base dash NG

124
00:08:11,880 --> 00:08:16,170
space dash A mac address
base to mac address.

125
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:19,140
A good idea is to copy
paste the mac addresses so

126
00:08:19,140 --> 00:08:23,623
you ensure that you are not making
any mistakes so whatsoever.

127
00:08:23,623 --> 00:08:25,949
You need ESSID.

128
00:08:28,530 --> 00:08:31,957
I'm pretty sure that you don't
need to use quotation marks, but

129
00:08:31,957 --> 00:08:35,693
if it's like a two part or something
like that, then you will need to use

130
00:08:35,693 --> 00:08:40,010
the quotation marks to make sure
that the string is loaded properly.

131
00:08:40,010 --> 00:08:41,800
Then we need a channel, of course.

132
00:08:41,800 --> 00:08:43,710
What will be the channel?

133
00:08:43,710 --> 00:08:50,024
Channel six, for those of you who
have enabled your monitor mode,

134
00:08:50,024 --> 00:08:53,765
via airmond dash NG, start VLP2S0.

135
00:08:53,765 --> 00:08:57,776
It will create a virtual interface,
which is mon zero.

136
00:08:57,776 --> 00:09:02,746
I didn't do that, so
I'm just gonna use VLP2S0, like this.

137
00:09:02,746 --> 00:09:10,850
Press enter, and now that I have my
fake wireless access point running.

138
00:09:10,850 --> 00:09:14,960
I am going to deauthenticate
pretty much everybody on the real

139
00:09:16,070 --> 00:09:19,450
access point with the ESSID something.

140
00:09:19,450 --> 00:09:24,381
Now, once I deauthenticate them, if
they attempt to automatically reconnect,

141
00:09:24,381 --> 00:09:27,460
they will all connect automatically back,
to me.

142
00:09:27,460 --> 00:09:34,500
For that I'm gonna need airplay dash NG
dash 00A, and then this Mac address here.

143
00:09:34,500 --> 00:09:39,310
This is simply the Mac address off
the real wireless access point.

144
00:09:39,310 --> 00:09:43,840
The one that we are faking here anyway,
why don't we just go ahead and

145
00:09:43,840 --> 00:09:44,670
press enter.

146
00:09:46,060 --> 00:09:49,009
Now I'm sending
the de-authentication packets and

147
00:09:49,009 --> 00:09:52,920
you see immediately there is a client
being re-associated with me.

148
00:09:52,920 --> 00:09:55,300
I'm gonna go ahead and
stop the de authentication packets but

149
00:09:55,300 --> 00:09:58,770
I will leave this running.

150
00:09:58,770 --> 00:10:05,110
And you see it says re-associated,
unencrypted to ESSID, Something.

151
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:08,140
Now what we can do with this traffic,
how can we.

152
00:10:08,140 --> 00:10:10,490
I'm not gonna show you
how to modify it now.

153
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:15,190
I've showed that in the part for fun,
where you can do all sorts of trickery,

154
00:10:15,190 --> 00:10:17,390
but we will do more serious stuff as well.

155
00:10:17,390 --> 00:10:22,510
However, now, I would like to show you how
you can actually monitor this traffic and

156
00:10:22,510 --> 00:10:26,280
what you can extract, what sort of
information can you extract from it.

157
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,130
Anyway, I bid you all farewell, and I
hope to see you all in the next tutorial.
