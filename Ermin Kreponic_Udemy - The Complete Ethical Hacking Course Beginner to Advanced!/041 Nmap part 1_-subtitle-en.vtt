00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200

Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.



2

00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.200

Today I will start a chapter on footprinting.



3

00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:11.000

So I have explained what the act of footprinting is before



4

00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.400

but now we will actually go ahead and conduct a few scans to see how it all works



5

00:00:16.400 --> 00:00:20.300

and introduce you to the tools that we will be using.



6

00:00:20.300 --> 00:00:23.500

So first off, we need to find ourselves a target to scan.



7

00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.000

Of course I could just scan myself or something of a kind



8

00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.800

but that would not be a realistic thing really



9

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:35.400

because I already know what the results are going to be, plus on top of that



10

00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:39.250

I'm not scanning long range over the Internet or something of a kind.



11

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.500

I would be scanning within my own local network



12

00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:44.400

so the speeds of the scan would not be realistic



13

00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:50.400

as it would be a lot faster then, say, when you conduct a scan over the net



14

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:53.300

some distant and remote server.



15

00:00:53.300 --> 00:00:57.000

So what I did was I went online, and you can do the same



16

00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:02.200

and I found on the official Nmap website



17

00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:08.000

they have a section devoted to actually allowing people to scan them to test their tool out.



18

00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000

Now here I am selecting the permission.



19

00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.200

There is a written permission here that you can actually scan this website



20

00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:19.200

and they basically say you can scan it to test it out.



21

00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:26.700

A few scans a day here  is fine, but do not scan a hundred times a day



22

00:01:26.700 --> 00:01:31.800

or use this to test your ssh brute-force password cracking tool, etc.



23

00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:34.000

So that's definitely something you don't want to do



24

00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.700

but you can run a few scans on this site per day



25

00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:41.000

and according to them, that's perfectly fine.



26

00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.850

You're not breaking any laws or anything of a kind



27

00:01:43.850 --> 00:01:50.000

and I am just emphasizing one more time that you do have a written permission right here on the site



28

00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000

which is fantastic, because it gives us an opportunity to actually simulate real time circumstances



29

00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:59.600

and see how Nmap behaves.



30

00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:06.200

Now Nmap is an unescapable tool of pretty much any pen tester out there.



31

00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:11.700

Many people say today that it's pointless to port scan



32

00:02:11.700 --> 00:02:13.700

it doesn't do you much good, and so on and so forth.



33

00:02:13.700 --> 00:02:19.000

Well, perhaps in terms of exploiting the services running on the port themselves



34

00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.700

it doesn't do you much good



35

00:02:20.700 --> 00:02:24.900

but just by seeing which ports are open and which ports are closed



36

00:02:24.900 --> 00:02:26.400

you can, to a fairly good extent



37

00:02:26.400 --> 00:02:32.400

determine what operating system or what platform is being used on the other side



38

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:35.700

and then you can find weaknesses of that same platform.



39

00:02:35.700 --> 00:02:37.920

Of course, there are some other ways of doing this.



40

00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:41.600

I will show them to you, like banner grabbing or something of a kind



41

00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:45.500

but let's just see how Nmap really works.



42

00:02:45.500 --> 00:02:51.590

Now Nmap is known to basically trigger quite a lot of alarms



43

00:02:51.590 --> 00:02:56.300

quite a lot of firewall red flags, so to say



44

00:02:56.300 --> 00:03:01.200

and you want to make sure that your Nmap scans are as quiet as possible.



45

00:03:01.200 --> 00:03:05.500

Now there are tools to actually figured this out



46

00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:10.300

but I will show you here how to actually do it by a terminal.



47

00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:13.000

There's also something called zenmap.



48

00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:18.500

Now zenmap is basically a graphical user interface of nmap, but we will not be using that.



49

00:03:18.500 --> 00:03:22.200

Rather instead, I want to teach you how to use a terminal version



50

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:25.200

So nmap is the one most commonly used



51

00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:28.500

and it is always used in the terminal text format.



52

00:03:28.500 --> 00:03:33.000

Rarely anybody uses the actual graphical user interface.



53

00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000

In the previous chapter, we have also discussed how to stay anonymous.



54

00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000

So at the end of this chapter, I will be combining these things --



55

00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:48.300

The act of scanning and anonymizing your scans.



56

00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:53.200

However, you might think about that before you get to the final tutorial of this chapter



57

00:03:53.200 --> 00:03:55.600

and perhaps try to do it yourselves.



58

00:03:55.600 --> 00:03:59.200

It doesn't matter if you fail or something or kind, it truly doesn't.



59

00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:03.800

What is important is that you give it a shot and you try it once.



60

00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:06.000

Okay, failure. Fine. No problems.



61

00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.500

Try it twice, thrice



62

00:04:07.500 --> 00:04:11.000

The fourth time you're bound to have some sort of results.



63

00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:13.800

As long as you keep improving yourselves, it's fine.



64

00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:21.500

In any case, without further ado, let's just type in "nmap - -help"



65

00:04:21.500 --> 00:04:25.000

Whoops, I mistyped that of course



66

00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.500

"nmap - -help", press ENTER, and there we go.



67

00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:30.500

There are a lot of options here.



68

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.000

I mean, a ton load of options.



69

00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.800

Way more options than we actually need for some sort of basic things.



70

00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:41.300

However, eventually over time



71

00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:45.700

you will come to understand that all of these options are not here for nothing.



72

00:04:45.700 --> 00:04:51.000

They are here because they were needed at some point of time



73

00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.770

and they are pretty much all still used.



74

00:04:53.770 --> 00:04:58.000

So what you need to do is scroll down to the bottom



75

00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.300

and here you have examples of how nmap runs



76

00:05:02.300 --> 00:05:06.400

So you type in "nmap -v" almost always



77

00:05:06.400 --> 00:05:08.600

99% of times



78

00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:12.000

99% of time is verbose output.



79

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:19.000

Basically you're telling your system to give you more information in regards to what it is doing.



80

00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000

"-A" -- I am not sure what this function is...



81

00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:28.000

Oh here is  -- "-A: Enable OS detection, version detection, script scanning, and traceroute"



82

00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.500

I don't think we're going to need that immediately.



83

00:05:30.500 --> 00:05:35.000

There is -o function, which is just for OS detection.



84

00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:41.640

Anyway. and then you can pass either this one -- scanme.nmap.org



85

00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:46.200

which is basically the domain name, which will get resolved to an IP address



86

00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:48.600

or you can actually pass it an IP address



87

00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:52.500

and if you're wondering what this is, this is a mask



88

00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:56.600

and it would be very difficult to explain in great detail what this is



89

00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:02.200

but for the time being, know that this is actually an IP address range.



90

00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:06.300

So it goes from a certain IP address to a certain IP address



91

00:06:06.300 --> 00:06:11.700

because this goes way into networking and binary numbers, and so on and so forth



92

00:06:11.700 --> 00:06:13.800

but you do not actually need to use this format.



93

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:18.600

Not that many people actually use this particular format with the mask.



94

00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:22.300

They just tend to specify very specific ranges



95

00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:27.200

because they usually don't have the permissions to scan the entire subnet.



96

00:06:27.200 --> 00:06:30.390

Rather instead, they have to create lists



97

00:06:30.390 --> 00:06:35.200

and then skip certain IP addresses, and then continue again from a certain point.



98

00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.000

So they do need to create lists, and that can be a problem.



99

00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:46.400

Now up here, at the top, you have another very important option that will come in handy.



100

00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:51.200

You have "-iL <inputfilename>



101

00:06:51.200 --> 00:06:58.000

So you can actually create a list in a file, a list of IP addresses



102

00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000

and then you can scan those particular IP addresses.



103

00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:05.200

You also have an ability to do this



104

00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:07.300

Look at what's written here



105

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:10.700

So just take a look at this segment --It's 10.0



106

00:07:10.700 --> 00:07:17.700

and then this segment here, this octet -- It's 0.255



107

00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:22.200

and then the last octet is 1 - 254



108

00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.000

If you're wondering why I'm calling these things octets



109

00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:29.600

it's because they have eight bits.



110

00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.000

Each one of these has 8 bits and it is represented in a binary form.



111

00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:41.300

So it can have eight zeros or, I don't know, eight ones or a combination of ones and zeros



112

00:07:41.300 --> 00:07:45.000

but it has eight bits...so eight positions.



113

00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.900

That's why they're called octets.



114

00:07:47.900 --> 00:07:51.000

This is a very common form that people tend to use



115

00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.500

and this is what you will find yourselves using.



116

00:07:54.500 --> 00:07:58.500

Either this -- This will be a method in which will specify the IP addresses



117

00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:02.200

or you will be passing files.



118

00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:08.600

So these files, usually people either make them themselves



119

00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:12.300

or they can find these IP addresses on the internet.



120

00:08:12.300 --> 00:08:17.400

So in addition to this site -- nmap.org



121

00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:30.000

you also have this one here...



122

00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000

This is a fantastic website.



123

00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000

The entire range of pretty much all the IP addresses are listed here



124

00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.900

and it also says who owns what



125

00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.400

it doesn't say for every one of them who owns which one



126

00:08:45.400 --> 00:08:50.000

but for example, you can search and find



127

00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:56.200

and it's gonna give you the appropriate IP addresses for that particular country



128

00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:58.900

and it's gonna give you the owner of those IP addresses.



129

00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:04.400

Usually just telecoms, but you also have other people who own them as well.



130

00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:06.430

So let's just give it a shot



131

00:09:06.430 --> 00:09:17.000

Let's just type in Germany or, I don't know, France...



132

00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.600

Okay, this is not the proper search, but not a problem.



133

00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:26.500

You can actually can find it down here



134

00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:32.500

or I could CTRL F France



135

00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:34.800

and there we go.



136

00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:39.200

So you have a range -- This is a given range here



137

00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:46.600

It's from 2.0.0.0 to 2.15.255.255



138

00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:51.100

This is a massive range. This is a humongous range.



139

00:09:51.100 --> 00:09:54.600

This is how many IP addresses you can have in total.



140

00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.200

How many of them you can generate within this range.



141

00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.800

It's quite a lot



142

00:09:58.800 --> 00:10:01.000

It's French telecom



143

00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000

For some reason they need it, so you can sort them out by the owner



144

00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.050

and you can see that a lot of them are actually not listed here.



145

00:10:10.050 --> 00:10:13.400

France has a lot of IP addresses assigned to it.



146

00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:15.300

They're not free, they cost money.



147

00:10:15.300 --> 00:10:22.100

Let's just go ahead and see down below...

Where is it? Where is it?



148

00:10:22.100 --> 00:10:25.200

Okay, so you see all of these IP addresses



149

00:10:25.200 --> 00:10:27.800

and this is a pretty massive range...



150

00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:34.000

So this is a telecom in France.



151

00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000

Look at how many IP addresses ranges they have.



152

00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:39.300

That's quite a lot



153

00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:45.200

and this site, as I said previously, you can use to figure out which IP address range do you wish scan



154

00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.500

but you usually do not have the permission to scan the entire range.



155

00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:52.800

You can scan certain IP addresses within that range for which you have a permission



156

00:10:52.800 --> 00:10:57.200

but also very nice site to determine where the IP address is from or something like that.



157

00:10:57.200 --> 00:11:00.200

However, always remember --



158

00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:06.000

Once you get an IP address, your search engines on the net are your best friends.



159

00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:11.300

This is one of the major components of footprinting.



160

00:11:11.300 --> 00:11:12.900

You can do the following --



161

00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:18.000

You can type in "who is" and then type an IP address.



162

00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.200

I'm just gonna type in this random IP address.



163

00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:27.000

So if you don't want to see it here, you can have a look at it here.



164

00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.500

Somebody is going to tell me who this guy is



165

00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:36.700

There we go



166

00:11:36.700 --> 00:11:41.600

So I've typed in "who is" and I've picked the first website out that I could find



167

00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:46.500

and here I have all the information in regards to that particular IP address.



168

00:11:46.500 --> 00:11:53.000

I have a country, I have the username of the admin I suppose



169

00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000

I have its status, remarks, source



170

00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:07.000

There's actually an address, a physical address of the IP, which is ridiculous.



171

00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:15.400

So as I said, search engines are your best, absolutely best, friends.



172

00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:20.400

If you want to find pretty much anything on the net or something like that



173

00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.800

in regards to an IP address, to do any sort of research.



174

00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:30.000

Those are the two tools that I have showed you, actually three of them



175

00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.960

well, one tool, one website, and one search method



176

00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:41.500

which you can use in order to determine where the IP address is from or who is using it



177

00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.900

and even to determine its physical location, although its physical location can be assigned to a telecom



178

00:12:46.900 --> 00:12:53.700

and that telecom can assign it to a city, to a specific region in the city, or something of a kind



179

00:12:53.700 --> 00:12:58.400

and then you can find it on Google Earth or something of a kind



180

00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.700

but usually those things are not that precise.



181

00:13:00.700 --> 00:13:05.500

What is precise, however, is that the IP address belongs to telecom or something or kind



182

00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:08.300

and they keep rotating them in between the cities



183

00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:14.300

So if you have like a hundred thousand IP addresses that you scan, and you wish to sort them out by the city



184

00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:22.000

you will like 70% to 90% accuracy, depending for which country did you do it.



185

00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:24.800

This can be problematic because you're gonna miss out on some things



186

00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:26.540

but you don't need 100% accuracy.



187

00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.700

You can get your sorting done pretty well.



188

00:13:28.700 --> 00:13:30.900

There are databases which you can update.



189

00:13:30.900 --> 00:13:32.400

I will show you these things.



190

00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:35.000

They are called goip lookups



191

00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:42.500

but before we do that, you also have something called "nslookup"



192

00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:49.000

and I'm just going to use this generic name here -- scanme,nmap.org



193

00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.500

paste it, and here we go



194

00:13:52.500 --> 00:14:01.200

I have basically said I want to look up files on scanme.nmap.org



195

00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.600

and okay, this is my DNS server, which is basically my router.



196

00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.200

You see it says port 53



197

00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:15.500

You know immediately that it's DNS because all the units traffic runs on port 53



198

00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.240

and then we have the results.



199

00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.200

So this is the domain name, and you get the IP address down below.



200

00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:26.900

So this is also one of the ways in which you can get the IP address of a site within a domain



201

00:14:26.900 --> 00:14:28.700

because once you know the domain



202

00:14:28.700 --> 00:14:32.400

you don't actually know the IP address until you look it up or something like that



203

00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:33.800

but there is a far simpler method.



204

00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:36.200

You don't need to use nslookup.



205

00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:38.600

Oh, by the way, nslookup also works in reverse.



206

00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:45.500

Just type in "nslookup", and you can type in the IP address.



207

00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:49.440

So let's just go ahead and press Enter



208

00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:57.000

Okay, so this has run through a process of some sort down below.



209

00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.300

These are authoritative answers from the name server.



210

00:15:01.300 --> 00:15:04.000

Basically what that means they're DNS servers



211

00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:08.000

and they're giving you responses and telling you who the domain belongs to



212

00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000

and so on and so forth



213

00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:15.500

Ignore this part, and for the time being we can also ignore this part



214

00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:20.800

until we get into spoofing the DNS and changing it



215

00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:22.000

and so on and so forth.



216

00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:27.200

What I want to show you here is that you can actually get a domain name by typing in nslookup



217

00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:28.800

and then the IP address



218

00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:32.380

and here, where it says "Non-authoritative answer"



219

00:15:32.380 --> 00:15:38.000

you get the IP address and then you get the name, which the domain name.



220

00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.200

However, you might notice that there was a problem here --



221

00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:46.000

That this IP address does not match this one.



222

00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.400

Well guess what? It actually does.



223

00:15:48.400 --> 00:15:50.800

Try looking it in reverse.



224

00:15:50.800 --> 00:15:55.130

So it's 74, 74 here



225

00:15:55.130 --> 00:16:02.200

207, 207 here, 244, 244 here, 221 here, and 221 here.



226

00:16:02.200 --> 00:16:08.000

So when you do an nslookup and when you pass in an IP address



227

00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:13.500

it's gonna do a reverse lookup in the DNS MX records or something of a kid.



228

00:16:13.500 --> 00:16:18.700

It's gonna query the DNS servers and the DNS servers are going to give it a response



229

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:22.400

but in the MX records, this is basically how things are written.



230

00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.800

You write an IP address in reverse and then you put this in "in-addr.arpa"



231

00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:32.200

but this part really is not that interesting to us.



232

00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:38.100

This is more interesting to server admins who configure the DNS servers or something of a kind.



233

00:16:38.100 --> 00:16:39.600

In any case, for the time being



234

00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.600

but don't worry, we will get to DNS servers in the later stages of this tutorial



235

00:16:44.600 --> 00:16:47.000

once we are done with these things.



236

00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.300

In any case, what is important for you here is you've typed in an IP address



237

00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:58.000

you've use tool called nslookup and you have gotten a domain name in return



238

00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.500

and now you can start doing some other things as well



239

00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:05.780

but we will be dealing primarily with nmap.



240

00:17:05.780 --> 00:17:11.530

Nmap as a tool in order to scan networks and retrieve information from them



241

00:17:11.530 --> 00:17:14.800

but this what I've showed you now is some basic information retrieval



242

00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:18.470

and some basic external sources that you can use.



243

00:17:18.470 --> 00:17:25.200

In any case, I'll see you in part two of nmap introduction



244

00:17:25.200 --> 00:17:29.200

and there, we're going to actually conduct some scans and see how it all works.



245

00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:34.000

Thank you for watching and I hope to see you next time.
