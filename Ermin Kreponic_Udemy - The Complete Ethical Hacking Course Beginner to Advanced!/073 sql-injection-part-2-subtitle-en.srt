1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:03,500
Hello everybody and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:03,500 --> 00:00:07,500
This is a follow-up, so let's just go ahead and jump right in

3
00:00:07,500 --> 00:00:11,200
and continue from where I left off in the previous tutorial.

4
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,700
Anyway, one of the first things that you will need to do is type in

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:36,700
chmod -Rv /var/www/DVWA - 1.0.8

6
00:00:36,700 --> 00:00:38,600
Go ahead and press ENTER

7
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,800
Oh yeah, chmod does require you to actually give it a mod, so 777

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:45,700
Just go ahead and give it a global mod.

9
00:00:45,700 --> 00:00:49,000
Let me just show you the command one more time.

10
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:50,910
Let's make it a bit clearer

11
00:00:50,910 --> 00:00:51,410
Excellent

12
00:00:51,410 --> 00:00:56,200
So this is the command that you need to type in, in order to change the mod of your folder.

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:01:00,000
We are doing this so that we may actually see it here.

14
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,100
If we don't this, we won't actually see it here.

15
00:01:04,100 --> 00:01:08,100
Giving the global mode of 777 is a pretty bad idea

16
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:15,000
but considering that we are running this server locally, nobody really cares

17
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,800
because nobody actually from outside has access to this

18
00:01:18,800 --> 00:01:26,700
and it really doesn't matter, since you are the only person with access to this particular web server.

19
00:01:26,700 --> 00:01:28,209
Anyway, go ahead and click on it.

20
00:01:28,209 --> 00:01:32,200
You will immediately get this thing here

21
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:36,200
and it says "Unable to connect to the databas. mysql_error"

22
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,900
Click here to set up the database.

23
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:40,200
Go ahead and click on it.

24
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,500
It says "Backend Database: MySQL"

25
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:45,200
Whoops, what does it say here?

26
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,000
"Could not connect to the database - please check the config file"

27
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:52,700
Okay, the web app is actually right.

28
00:01:52,700 --> 00:01:55,800
We should check the config file to pass in some additional parameters

29
00:01:55,800 --> 00:02:05,000
but aside from that, we will need to actually get our SQL server up and running.

30
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,000
Go ahead and type in

31
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:35,600
apt -cache search mysql | grep -i database | less

32
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:44,400
Now I'm piping it into "less" so that it would  stop after a first screen full

33
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,200
and then I'm gonna scroll down manually through the rest of the packages.

34
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:49,200
Excellent!

35
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,900
So what do we got here?

36
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,100
Anything that we need?

37
00:02:53,100 --> 00:02:55,300
You might think that this is what you need, but no.

38
00:02:55,300 --> 00:02:57,200
We are looking for a client

39
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,000
Probably should have written a client, but it doesn't really matter

40
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:01,100
I can find it here.

41
00:03:01,100 --> 00:03:01,600
There we go

42
00:03:01,600 --> 00:03:03,200
It says "mysql - client"

43
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,500
Go ahead and copy that name

44
00:03:05,500 --> 00:03:08,000
Press U to exit this

45
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,500
Type in "apt - get install mysql - client"

46
00:03:15,500 --> 00:03:18,609
The server is already installed, if I'm not mistaken

47
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:20,000
and there we go.

48
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,300
It's done

49
00:03:21,300 --> 00:03:27,600
If the server is not installed, you can do this as well, just in case

50
00:03:27,600 --> 00:03:30,400
server, press ENTER

51
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:31,400
and there we go.

52
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:38,700
So this command that I have selected here, you can run it through just in case

53
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:45,600
and you need to run this command, the second one that I've selected, as well.

54
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:47,400
I hope that is clear enough.

55
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:50,600
That way, we will be able to access our SQL server.

56
00:03:50,600 --> 00:04:04,700
Now what we need to do is type in "service mysql start"

57
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:05,700
Yep, there we go

58
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:11,600
"starting MySQL database server: mysqld already running"

59
00:04:11,600 --> 00:04:16,000
So what I can do here is type in "restart"

60
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,570
stopping, starting, and there we go.

61
00:04:20,570 --> 00:04:24,000
Okay, so no problems there.

62
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:26,200
I've been doing some tampering with it.

63
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:30,500
So it just did some cleaning up work for me, no big deal there.

64
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:34,200
Anyway, you will need this command - service mysql start

65
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:37,100
It will not be started by default.

66
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:42,300
As I said, I've been tampering with it, so it's already up and running on my system

67
00:04:42,300 --> 00:04:47,000
primarily because I need to test things out before I actually showed them to you

68
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:50,000
Now go ahead and clear the screen.

69
00:04:50,000 --> 00:05:07,600
You can type in "mysql -h localhost -u root -p"

70
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,200
Now if you're doing this the first time around

71
00:05:10,200 --> 00:05:15,700
if you haven't done any configuration to the SQL database, you will not use the "p" parameter.

72
00:05:15,700 --> 00:05:17,200
So no p parameter

73
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,400
You will delete it and this is what you will type in

74
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:25,100
I'm gonna get an error saying "Access denied" because I am using a password

75
00:05:25,100 --> 00:05:26,800
and it says here "using password: NO"

76
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,400
because I haven't passed any password parameters

77
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,400
but if you are running it for the first time, this is the command which you need to use --

78
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:41,800
mysql -h  localhost -u root

79
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:43,800
without any password parameters

80
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:45,700
because I've already set the password.

81
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,700
I am going to type in "-p" for password argument

82
00:05:49,700 --> 00:05:53,300
and I'm going to take my passport here, and there we go.

83
00:05:53,300 --> 00:05:55,200
It's up and running

84
00:05:55,200 --> 00:05:57,260
I can actually connect to it without any problems.

85
00:05:57,260 --> 00:06:00,400
I'm currently using the MySQL database.

86
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,800
This is what you type in the second time around

87
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:04,200
when you actually set the password.

88
00:06:04,200 --> 00:06:06,900
You just type in "-p" for password argument

89
00:06:06,900 --> 00:06:11,100
and if you're running it the first time around, you just type in this command.

90
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:13,500
I don't want to reiterate it again.

91
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:15,000
I hope you got that part.

92
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,300
If you didn't, feel free to ask me pretty much anything you wish in the discussion section on Udemy.

93
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:27,400
Anyway, the mysql command syntax is a lot different from the Linux one.

94
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:28,900
For example, you don't have clear

95
00:06:28,900 --> 00:06:33,800
and you need to put semicolons at the end of your statements for them to take effect.

96
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:39,400
Now I have prepared a small list of commands here for us to use today.

97
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,000
I want you to take a look at them

98
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:57,000
Let's just...Ugh, come on. Don't do this to me

99
00:06:57,000 --> 00:07:01,000
Font...Give me 16

100
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:08,370
Okay, so now you can see it a bit better.

101
00:07:08,370 --> 00:07:11,600
This is the command that you need to run.

102
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:14,400
So you can type in any password you wish here.

103
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,900
I'm gonna go ahead and type in "test", as this machine is primarily for testing purposes.

104
00:07:18,900 --> 00:07:23,419
I would suggest that you type in something relatively complex.

105
00:07:23,419 --> 00:07:27,400
If you really want to be secure and stuff like that

106
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:34,500
you can type in eight characters with all sorts of things, like thoughts, @ signs

107
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:37,600
no words from English dictionary or anything of a kind

108
00:07:37,600 --> 00:07:42,100
but again, don't emphasize security too much now

109
00:07:42,100 --> 00:07:46,500
primarily because this is a virtual machine and only you have access to it

110
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,600
and only you will be using this SQL Server

111
00:07:49,600 --> 00:07:54,600
and I really don't think there is a need to type in anything super complex here.

112
00:07:54,600 --> 00:07:58,400
I am using the password "test", although after the end of this tutorial

113
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,200
I am probably gonna delete this machine all together.

114
00:08:02,200 --> 00:08:05,300
Anyway, this is the command which you need to use.

115
00:08:05,300 --> 00:08:14,200
Capital letters are not mandatory, but they're quite nice if you want to have a good layout of the syntax.

116
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:19,400
If you type in this with lower case letters, this command is gonna work just fine as well.

117
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:23,840
I'm gonna do this without the semicolon, just to show you what happens

118
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,400
So copy, and paste it here

119
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,000
Basically like English language that says set password

120
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:42,000
It says "SET PASSWORD FOR root@localhost=PASSWORD( 'test' )

121
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:45,000
The quotation marks are not part of the password.

122
00:08:45,000 --> 00:08:48,300
In between the quotation marks, you will type your password in.

123
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:50,500
So if I press ENTER, nothing's gonna happen.

124
00:08:50,500 --> 00:08:54,800
It's just gonna move on to the second line and wait for a second set of commands

125
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:57,540
but you can either pass different or additional parameters here.

126
00:08:57,540 --> 00:09:01,000
For the time being, I'm not gonna do that.

127
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:05,200
I just want a simple password for my MySQL database and that's it.

128
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:09,900
You can check it out in the advanced setting passwords for MySQL databases

129
00:09:09,900 --> 00:09:13,000
You will see that you can pass in a ton load of parameters

130
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:19,000
ranging from encryption to substituting old passwords with new ones

131
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:20,800
and so on and so forth.

132
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:23,100
For the time being, I'm just gonna semicolon

133
00:09:23,100 --> 00:09:26,400
but if you want to pass some additional arguments you could type them in here.

134
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:29,500
If not, type in the semicolon, press ENTER

135
00:09:29,500 --> 00:09:30,700
and it's gonna finish it

136
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:34,400
It says "Query OK, 0 rows affected"

137
00:09:34,400 --> 00:09:38,200
because I already have the password set to "test"

138
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:40,000
I would love to be able to clear the screen.

139
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,400
I do believe that there is a command for that somewhere around here you

140
00:09:43,400 --> 00:09:45,200
but you cannot use clear.

141
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,000
That's just what I want to do emphasize here.

142
00:09:48,000 --> 00:09:51,300
Anyway, now that we the password set up

143
00:09:51,300 --> 00:09:56,300
I'm gonna type in "exit" and I'm gonna go back to my website to see

144
00:09:56,300 --> 00:10:00,400
Okay "Could not connect to the database - please check the config file"

145
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,400
Excellent

146
00:10:01,400 --> 00:10:03,660
Now we need to clear the screen.

147
00:10:03,660 --> 00:10:10,200
Go ahead and change your working directory to "cd /var/www/DVWA - 1.0.8"

148
00:10:10,200 --> 00:10:11,700
Where is the config file?

149
00:10:11,700 --> 00:10:14,200
Here it is -- The first row

150
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:16,200
So "cd/config

151
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:18,200
Let's see what's in the config file.

152
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:19,700
It's a php file

153
00:10:19,700 --> 00:10:20,300
Excellent

154
00:10:20,300 --> 00:10:24,000
So just type in "nano config"

155
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:26,600
and scroll down.

156
00:10:26,600 --> 00:10:30,840
You will see here, it says "[   'db_server'  ] = 'localhost'; "

157
00:10:30,840 --> 00:10:33,300
database...dvwa

158
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:35,400
Okay, you can leave that. That's gonna get created.

159
00:10:35,400 --> 00:10:37,300
db_user, root

160
00:10:37,300 --> 00:10:40,700
This is definitely not our password.

161
00:10:40,700 --> 00:10:43,000
We need to type in "test"

162
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:46,200
Whoa, whoa, whoa...that's not what I want to do.

163
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:48,200
Let me just move here.

164
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:49,700
Delete this password

165
00:10:49,700 --> 00:10:56,700
Type in "test", CRTL O to save it, and CTRL X to exit.

166
00:10:56,700 --> 00:10:58,800
There are other ways of authentication

167
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,100
but we're just going to use this simple password for the time being.

168
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:08,200
Now I have noticed that, since I have created this new user test for myself in a  Kali Linux

169
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:14,800
there have been people in the discussion section who have been complaining about the permissions problem.

170
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,500
Just make sure that you are root

171
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:20,200
So whatever you doing of this nature or kind

172
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:24,500
and if you're configuring passwords or editing these sort of files

173
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:26,500
make sure that you are root.

174
00:11:26,500 --> 00:11:28,760
You become root by typing "su"

175
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:37,300
Okay, let me just go ahead and exit

176
00:11:37,300 --> 00:11:39,500
Excellent

177
00:11:39,500 --> 00:11:42,800
So I am now test@kali

178
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:47,200
and if I type in "su", I get prompted for a password

179
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,800
and if  type in "test"

180
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:53,800
Oh, come on

181
00:11:53,800 --> 00:11:54,800
Excellent

182
00:11:54,800 --> 00:12:00,200
I type in my password, and it's root@kali

183
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:01,700
I become root

184
00:12:01,700 --> 00:12:03,300
Though it may seem strange to some people

185
00:12:03,300 --> 00:12:04,900
because I'm giving up my password here

186
00:12:04,900 --> 00:12:10,700
but as I said, it's a virtual machine that I am going delete after this tutorial is done

187
00:12:10,700 --> 00:12:13,700
so it doesn't really matter to me at all.

188
00:12:13,700 --> 00:12:16,600
I haven't even tuned the security precautions of this machine.

189
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:24,000
To a large extent, I have created real-time circumstances, but most of my passwords are like this.

190
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:26,830
So they're pretty weak and they can be busted really fast.

191
00:12:26,830 --> 00:12:32,000
Fortunately for me, nobody from outside world has access to this machine.

192
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:34,320
Anyway, go ahead and clear the screen.

193
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,300
Now it did tell me that some services have stopped

194
00:12:36,300 --> 00:12:42,800
I'm just gonna type in "service mysql status"

195
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,000
Is it running?

196
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:56,000
Okay, so it has threads. I guess it's running.

197
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:58,230
Okay, it is running.

198
00:12:58,230 --> 00:12:59,800
It's a little bit different in Fedora.

199
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,800
It actually tells you immediately if it's active or running.

200
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,800
I'm sure it's says somewhere in this text that as well, but it has threats, I guess it is running.

201
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:13,500
Anyway, just go ahead and clear the screen. .

202
00:13:13,500 --> 00:13:26,700
Now "service apache2 restart"

203
00:13:26,700 --> 00:13:27,600
Excellent

204
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:32,400
So it says that it "Could not reliably determine the server's fully qualified domain name"

205
00:13:32,400 --> 00:13:33,800
It doesn't really matter

206
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:37,700
That's not an error. That's a warning.

207
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:41,400
Go back to your site and it says "Create database"

208
00:13:41,400 --> 00:13:42,000
Excellent

209
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,300
So you see, "Database has been created"

210
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:46,200
" 'users' table was created"

211
00:13:46,200 --> 00:13:48,600
"Data inserted in 'users' table"

212
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:50,180
Guestbook data inserted

213
00:13:50,180 --> 00:13:51,600
Successful!

214
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,100
No problems, it runs smoothly.

215
00:13:54,100 --> 00:14:01,700
If you have any problems concerning this procedure, before you post the question

216
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:05,100
I would advise, if you get an error of some sort, or something of a kind

217
00:14:05,100 --> 00:14:07,400
Copy/Paste the error immediately.

218
00:14:07,400 --> 00:14:09,500
Don't wait for me to ask for the error.

219
00:14:09,500 --> 00:14:14,600
You will save a lot of time by just copying the error immediately, so I can see what the problem is

220
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:19,500
and my first reply doesn't need to be copy the error and then you wait

221
00:14:19,500 --> 00:14:21,500
and then you copy the error and then you wait again

222
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:22,700
and then I give you a reply.

223
00:14:22,700 --> 00:14:24,800
Rather instead, copy the error immediately

224
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:28,400
so that my first reply can be "Oh, you need to do this..."

225
00:14:28,400 --> 00:14:35,000
and then you do it and solve the problems for yourself, making it a far faster method.

226
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:38,000
Anyway, here I'm going to conclude this tutorial

227
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:41,400
and we're gonna continue off in the next one.

228
00:14:41,400 --> 00:14:46,000
Until then, I bid you farewell and wish you a lot of success.
