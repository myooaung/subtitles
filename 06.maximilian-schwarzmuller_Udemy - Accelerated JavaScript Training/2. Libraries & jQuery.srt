00:00:01,320  -->  00:00:06,480
Starting with the libraries, jQuery of course is a very important one and I can't imagine you haven't

2

00:00:06,480  -->  00:00:07,700
heard of it.

3

00:00:07,710  -->  00:00:10,070
It is Javascript,

4

00:00:10,070  -->  00:00:16,790
it uses pure Javascript but it added many convenience functions, helpers and methods.

5

00:00:16,980  -->  00:00:23,210
So jQuery almost is like its own language and it's sometimes mistaken for that but it is Javascript

6

00:00:23,400  -->  00:00:25,520
at the end, just with a lot of helpers

7

00:00:25,770  -->  00:00:30,650
and if you check out the documentation, you'll quickly learn where it helps you.

8

00:00:30,690  -->  00:00:38,160
For example with Ajax which you saw in the Ajax module which makes it very easy to use with jQuery, for

9

00:00:38,160  -->  00:00:41,060
example with accessing the DOM,

10

00:00:41,190  -->  00:00:49,790
so selecting different elements or traversing through the DOM or manipulating the DOM, that is where jQuery

11

00:00:49,800  -->  00:00:53,210
is really strong and where it will really help you

12

00:00:53,220  -->  00:00:59,120
and why is that popular. Now using a library like jQuery is really simple,

13

00:00:59,160  -->  00:01:03,350
one thing of course is learning it but there are a lot of tutorials out on that

14

00:01:03,360  -->  00:01:05,190
and it is enough

15

00:01:05,310  -->  00:01:09,720
content for its own course but installing it is really simple.

16

00:01:09,720  -->  00:01:15,090
You for example on the jQuery homepage here, you would go to the download page and then you simply

17

00:01:15,240  -->  00:01:20,970
download the version you want to use and you dump it into your project folder and then you add a script

18

00:01:21,060  -->  00:01:25,280
import, tag script source and link to that folder

19

00:01:25,320  -->  00:01:32,160
and of course you will see detailed explanations here on the jQuery page on how to do

20

00:01:32,160  -->  00:01:32,360
this

21

00:01:32,370  -->  00:01:34,130
but it is really simple.
