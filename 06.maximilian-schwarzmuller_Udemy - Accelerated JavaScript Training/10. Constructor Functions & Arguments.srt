1

00:00:00,950  -->  00:00:06,030
Now I cleaned this all up and I have a simpler constructor function here with a person.

2

00:00:06,030  -->  00:00:12,030
The cool thing is you cannot only pass something like this where we already have starting values but

3

00:00:12,030  -->  00:00:18,600
you might want to have a constructor function where you can pass a name and an age upon creation and you

4

00:00:18,600  -->  00:00:22,500
would set this name equal to name and this age equal to age.

5

00:00:22,500  -->  00:00:27,390
Notice that here of course, I don't have this since I'm referring to the arguments passed to this function

6

00:00:27,400  -->  00:00:27,530
.

7

00:00:27,630  -->  00:00:32,850
Remember, in the end this is a normal function so we can work inside it as we could work in any function.

8

00:00:33,690  -->  00:00:35,670
Here I can then pass Max

9

00:00:38,310  -->  00:00:49,200
and 27 and if I print this object to the console, guess what we will see? We'll see age and name being set because

10

00:00:49,590  -->  00:00:53,310
this was set here in the constructor function

11

00:00:53,410  -->  00:00:54,740
and this of course is a behavior

12

00:00:54,750  -->  00:01:03,810
you'll often need, the chance to have a generic blueprint but fill it with different values for different

13

00:01:03,810  -->  00:01:06,030
objects based on that blueprint.

14

00:01:06,030  -->  00:01:17,160
So you could create a Max object and then create an Anna object here as well, using the same blueprint but with

15

00:01:17,160  -->  00:01:18,450
different values

16

00:01:18,630  -->  00:01:26,790
and then once you print both out to the console, you will of course see the differences but they're based

17

00:01:26,790  -->  00:01:29,130
on the same blueprint here.
