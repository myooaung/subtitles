00:00:01,360  -->  00:00:05,450
Now I was also mentioning the modularity which would be great

2

00:00:05,670  -->  00:00:09,020
and with that, I was of course referring to the fact that I already explained.

3

00:00:09,210  -->  00:00:15,870
You want to split up your application over several files, modules and then if you need some module in one

4

00:00:15,870  -->  00:00:20,370
file, simply throw in an import at the top and have all the code from this file available.

5

00:00:20,370  -->  00:00:27,070
The reason you might want to do this is that you don't want to have like 30 imports in your HTML

6

00:00:27,070  -->  00:00:33,480
files with the script tags and then also keep a close eye to the ordering and whenever you

7

00:00:33,480  -->  00:00:37,540
change something, some dependency, you need to change the ordering

8

00:00:37,590  -->  00:00:40,590
and that is close to impossible to manage

9

00:00:40,620  -->  00:00:42,720
and really no fun.

10

00:00:42,790  -->  00:00:48,660
Therefore it would be great if you could import and export modules in Javascript but you can't by default,

11

00:00:48,660  -->  00:00:51,050
at least not with ES5.

12

00:00:51,060  -->  00:00:56,910
The great thing is there are packages or tools which still add this functionality

13

00:00:56,970  -->  00:01:04,350
and what those tools do is they will simply allow you to use modules during development and then for

14

00:01:04,380  -->  00:01:11,520
deploying or running your application, they will manually figure out the dependencies you set up during

15

00:01:11,520  -->  00:01:18,570
development and either import the files in the correct order automatically or bundle them all together

16

00:01:18,570  -->  00:01:19,800
into one file,

17

00:01:19,830  -->  00:01:23,570
still keeping the correct ordering for everything to work.

18

00:01:23,730  -->  00:01:26,350
Now there are a lot of popular choices

19

00:01:26,400  -->  00:01:32,640
and again this is content for its own course but a popular choice is webpack for example and you might

20

00:01:32,640  -->  00:01:38,830
start on its official Github page here which is github.com/webpack/webpack and

21

00:01:39,180  -->  00:01:42,760
there you will find links to the documentation and so on.

22

00:01:42,780  -->  00:01:47,630
And again, this is really something on its own to learn but it's worth it.

23

00:01:47,770  -->  00:01:53,130
An alternative is systemjs, which unlike webpack is less of a tool,

24

00:01:53,220  -->  00:01:54,720
setting up everything,

25

00:01:54,840  -->  00:02:00,720
it's more like a script that you throw into your project and then it will automatically import files in

26

00:02:00,720  -->  00:02:02,480
the correct order for you.

27

00:02:02,640  -->  00:02:07,240
So this allows you to have one import in the end, script

28

00:02:07,260  -->  00:02:08,130
systemjs

29

00:02:08,280  -->  00:02:14,430
and then it will automatically import the rest for you which of course is great and it will figure out

30

00:02:14,460  -->  00:02:22,080
what it needs to import depending on the modules and the dependencies with imports and exports

31

00:02:22,100  -->  00:02:22,140
you

32

00:02:22,170  -->  00:02:25,120
set up in your project.

33

00:02:25,170  -->  00:02:28,680
So here again, the github page, systemjs/systemjs

34

00:02:28,690  -->  00:02:34,590
is a great starting point as well as Googling for it and you might also be interested in something

35

00:02:34,590  -->  00:02:43,260
like jspm, Javascript Package Manager which allows you to easily add libraries to your project and

36

00:02:43,290  -->  00:02:50,990
also use systemjs to load everything together in the right order and also prepare it for deployment

37

00:02:51,000  -->  00:02:55,700
with bundling, minification, so optimizing it by size and so on

38

00:02:55,920  -->  00:03:02,310
and again, here jspm.io is a great page to get started and dive into the documentation.

39

00:03:02,760  -->  00:03:10,290
And once you are there, you will better understand how all of that works, how you actually do import and export

40

00:03:10,290  -->  00:03:17,370
files but as I said, that really is a topic on its own and far beyond the scope of this course which

41

00:03:17,370  -->  00:03:22,110
was about plain Javascript and nothing but plain Javascript

42

00:03:22,200  -->  00:03:27,330
but this is certainly an interesting next step and I just wanted to give you the resources so that you

43

00:03:27,330  -->  00:03:31,210
know where to get started to dive into this deeper.

44

00:03:31,340  -->  00:03:35,720
I'll see you in all the other videos and I wish you all the best.
