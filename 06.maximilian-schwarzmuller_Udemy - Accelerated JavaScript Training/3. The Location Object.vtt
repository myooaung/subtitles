00:00:01.380  -->  00:00:06.060
So after seeing the window object and before diving into the document object,

2

00:00:06.180  -->  00:00:13.650
let's have a look at the location object which I have already showed before. So we can have a look at

3

00:00:13.650  -->  00:00:20.340
it again by simply logging with no dot location or as explained, just location since we are already on

4

00:00:20.340  -->  00:00:21.470
that window object.

5

00:00:21.600  -->  00:00:27.360
If I now hit run, we see that location object and it's pretty clearly and well-structured

6

00:00:27.360  -->  00:00:29.070
so let's go through that.

7

00:00:29.070  -->  00:00:31.760
Basically it holds a location we're currently at

8

00:00:31.770  -->  00:00:35.310
and this of course mainly means the URL, the host.

9

00:00:35.670  -->  00:00:45.870
So we for example can see the host we're at, the hostname which in this case here is equal, the path name

10

00:00:45.870  -->  00:00:47.280
for example

11

00:00:47.460  -->  00:00:57.240
and yes, that's a bit strange here on JSBin since we have this contained Javascript execution here

12

00:00:57.250  -->  00:00:57.280
but

13

00:00:57.300  -->  00:01:01.170
basically this would be whatever you have after your hostname here,

14

00:01:01.320  -->  00:01:10.830
so any path name here, that would be want you can extract on your own home page, which protocol was used

15

00:01:11.190  -->  00:01:16.350
and some built-in functions you may use; assign, reload and replace.

16

00:01:16.350  -->  00:01:23.310
So we can use all of that, we can for example print the hostname here and if I clear this, of course we

17

00:01:23.310  -->  00:01:29.610
get what we just saw in the overall holding object, so you can of course access all those fields here

18

00:01:29.620  -->  00:01:30.480
.

19

00:01:30.570  -->  00:01:39.600
We also can have a look at the path, so we can just use location.pathname to see the path we're currently

20

00:01:39.600  -->  00:01:39.750
at

21

00:01:39.750  -->  00:01:45.060
and if I hit run, we see /runner and as I explained, this is a bit strange here in JSBin.

22

00:01:45.330  -->  00:01:53.910
Normally the path is everything here after your domain, so the part you're at and to demonstrate this, let's

23

00:01:53.910  -->  00:01:57.430
head over to another webpage, for example to

24

00:01:57.450  -->  00:02:03.960
Github and just click anywhere here, any link so that you have more than just a domain here in your

25

00:02:03.960  -->  00:02:04.910
browser bar,

26

00:02:05.070  -->  00:02:11.130
then open you up your developer tools like shown before, control alt i or command alt i on Mac

27

00:02:11.550  -->  00:02:15.810
or simply over your overview

28

00:02:15.870  -->  00:02:21.720
and then developer, developer tools and then you can just print something here, you can write

29

00:02:21.810  -->  00:02:22.640
Javascript here

30

00:02:22.640  -->  00:02:28.340
too, of course very simple Javascript commands or code but it works

31

00:02:28.410  -->  00:02:33.480
and then I want to log location.pathname. If I now hit enter,

32

00:02:33.480  -->  00:02:37.260
so then you see /personal here which is the path here.

33

00:02:37.830  -->  00:02:43.260
You also and I'll stay here because I can show it here better than in JSBin where we have this

34

00:02:43.260  -->  00:02:45.330
contained browser window now.

35

00:02:45.330  -->  00:02:54.990
So here for example, I also can call location reload to reload the page or location replace

36

00:02:55.770  -->  00:03:04.200
to replace the URL with another one, pass a string here and replace it with google.com for

37

00:03:04.200  -->  00:03:05.080
example,

38

00:03:05.310  -->  00:03:07.850
hit enter and we're taken there.

39

00:03:07.920  -->  00:03:15.010
So this is how you can use the location object to navigate or to extract information about the page

40

00:03:15.010  -->  00:03:20.220
the user is currently on through the path name for example and so on.

41

00:03:20.220  -->  00:03:28.220
So really important too to get an idea of where you are and get to another point if you want that.
