00:00:03.270  -->  00:00:06.300
Now removing a child is pretty straightforward,

2

00:00:06.320  -->  00:00:15.960
unfortunately a bit difficult since not all browsers support the more convenient new method but it's

3

00:00:15.960  -->  00:00:22.140
not that difficult in the end, so I'll show the cross-browser working method first.

4

00:00:22.260  -->  00:00:30.720
Let's say we want to remove the second link, so I'll get rid of this code and just notice the paragraph will

5

00:00:30.720  -->  00:00:32.090
disappear the next time

6

00:00:32.220  -->  00:00:36.040
I hit run because I'm no longer inserting it and this is reloaded all the time,

7

00:00:36.060  -->  00:00:44.610
so keep that in mind but I want to remove the second link. So first I'll select it by using my query

8

00:00:44.610  -->  00:00:45.800
selector here

9

00:00:46.290  -->  00:00:52.590
and I'll need query selector all because we have three links and I don't want to get the first one but the second

10

00:00:52.590  -->  00:00:59.250
one and then I'll use the index one here to get the second anchor tag.

11

00:00:59.310  -->  00:01:07.150
Now to remove it, I have to do the following to make it work in all browsers, I'll execute a, so this selected

12

00:01:07.170  -->  00:01:16.920
anchor, then parent element or parent node would also work and then remove child a, so the child I

13

00:01:16.930  -->  00:01:17.870
want to remove.

14

00:01:18.060  -->  00:01:24.750
If I now run this, the link is gone. So that is a bit of an inconvenient way, right, that I have

15

00:01:24.750  -->  00:01:30.960
to select the parent of the element I want to remove just to then remove it with the remove child method

16

00:01:30.960  -->  00:01:31.100
but 

17

00:01:31.230  -->  00:01:37.380
that's the only version that is supported in older browsers as well. With newer browsers

18

00:01:37.380  -->  00:01:43.760
but this is not safe to be used unless you use some polyfills to add the functionality, you may just

19

00:01:43.830  -->  00:01:47.960
use the remove method which is of course much shorter.

20

00:01:47.970  -->  00:01:53.370
So if I run this, you still see it's gone and if I get rid of this, just to reload it and then add it so that

21

00:01:53.370  -->  00:02:02.170
we can really see it being deleted, you'll see

22

00:02:02.220  -->  00:02:04.640
this works but again, not in all browsers.

23

00:02:04.650  -->  00:02:06.500
So use this with caution,

24

00:02:06.510  -->  00:02:09.490
use the other method, parent

25

00:02:13.530  -->  00:02:21.160
element.removeChild and then passing the child to make sure it works in multiple, also all the

26

00:02:21.160  -->  00:02:21.840
browsers.
