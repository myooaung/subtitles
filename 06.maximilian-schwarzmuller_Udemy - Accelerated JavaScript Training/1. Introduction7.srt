00:00:01,260  -->  00:00:06,220
So until now, we covered a lot of pieces that make some Javascript applications.

2

00:00:06,390  -->  00:00:12,700
You know the basics of Javascript, how to work with it, what helpers and functionality it offers

3

00:00:12,710  -->  00:00:12,890
and 

4

00:00:12,990  -->  00:00:18,960
you know how to connect it to the HTML code, how to fetch elements, how to play around with them, how

5

00:00:18,960  -->  00:00:25,760
to change their properties, how to create new elements, how to delete elements and so on.

6

00:00:25,890  -->  00:00:29,740
That really is a lot but one key thing is certainly missing,

7

00:00:29,910  -->  00:00:32,790
you're not able to react to user interaction,

8

00:00:32,790  -->  00:00:36,390
you're not able to listen to events and that is important.

9

00:00:36,480  -->  00:00:40,660
Therefore this module is all about events.
