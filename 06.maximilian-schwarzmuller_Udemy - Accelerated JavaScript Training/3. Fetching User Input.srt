1

00:00:01,650  -->  00:00:09,570
So in this app.js, I'll use strict mode since that certainly makes sense

2

00:00:09,570  -->  00:00:14,460
and then I want to hook this button up to an event listener.

3

00:00:14,520  -->  00:00:21,360
Now the thing is I could do this in this file but this file will get very long because I need to fetch

4

00:00:21,380  -->  00:00:30,190
this button from the DOM, so get a reference to it. I'll also need to get references to the weather item

5

00:00:30,210  -->  00:00:33,090
here which I later want to update and so on.

6

00:00:33,090  -->  00:00:39,690
So I think it makes sense to have another script file where I initialize certain things, some kind

7

00:00:39,690  -->  00:00:49,380
of init.js file and this file should basically load some elements from the code or get me all

8

00:00:49,380  -->  00:00:52,730
the elements I need to work with throughout the application.

9

00:00:53,040  -->  00:01:00,330
So here, I'll also use strict mode and then I'll create a variable search button for example

10

00:01:00,330  -->  00:01:03,910
and I want to get this show weather button here.

11

00:01:04,380  -->  00:01:05,950
Now how can I get it?

12

00:01:06,210  -->  00:01:11,300
If we have a look at the index.html file, this is the button I want to get

13

00:01:11,550  -->  00:01:15,590
and as you can see, it doesn't have any class or ID

14

00:01:15,900  -->  00:01:19,580
but in this application, it's the only button on the whole page.

15

00:01:19,740  -->  00:01:27,360
So therefore I can simply use my query selector on my document here, query selector and

16

00:01:29,870  -->  00:01:31,310
select by tag,

17

00:01:31,320  -->  00:01:39,270
so by button tag and this should give me my search button. Next, I want to get the city the user entered

18

00:01:39,270  -->  00:01:39,730
.

19

00:01:39,730  -->  00:01:41,900
If we have a look at the index.html,

20

00:01:42,090  -->  00:01:44,220
we do have an ID on this input field,

21

00:01:44,220  -->  00:01:47,420
we could also select by input field since it's the only one

22

00:01:47,430  -->  00:01:49,280
but since an ID is given,

23

00:01:49,410  -->  00:01:52,190
why not just simply retrieve it like this,

24

00:01:52,530  -->  00:02:03,710
var searchCity equals document.querySelector and then #city to select by the ID, city here

25

00:02:03,720  -->  00:02:04,880
.

26

00:02:04,920  -->  00:02:10,200
Now with that, that's all I want to select for now but I'll add code to this file later.

27

00:02:10,200  -->  00:02:13,980
Now currently if we have a look at the index.html, we're not using that file, right,

28

00:02:14,040  -->  00:02:16,240
we're only importing app.js.

29

00:02:16,530  -->  00:02:23,090
Well we need init.js too and we need to import it before app.js of course because in app.js,

30

00:02:23,100  -->  00:02:31,800
I want to use all those things I initialize in init.js. So I'll add a script tag here too and I'll import

31

00:02:31,830  -->  00:02:34,020
init.js here.

32

00:02:34,410  -->  00:02:41,280
With that, I can go back to my app.js file and here, I can access the search button which

33

00:02:41,280  -->  00:02:44,680
I initialize in the other Javascript file, so it will be available here

34

00:02:44,970  -->  00:02:55,590
and add the event listener. I'll add a click event listener and I want to trigger a method or a function

35

00:02:55,590  -->  00:02:57,130
called search weather.

36

00:02:57,390  -->  00:03:03,770
Now we're getting a warning here that search button is not defined but we know that it will be available

37

00:03:03,780  -->  00:03:06,890
since we set this up in init.js.

38

00:03:07,020  -->  00:03:16,020
So here, I'll next create this function, searchWeather and I'm creating it after assigning this click listener

39

00:03:16,320  -->  00:03:22,650
because if you remember this, it will be pulled up to the top of the file by Javascript.

40

00:03:22,710  -->  00:03:24,290
So in search weather,

41

00:03:24,390  -->  00:03:31,950
all I want to do now is I want to output this search city, so what the user entered into this input

42

00:03:31,950  -->  00:03:32,610
field.

43

00:03:33,060  -->  00:03:41,840
So I'll output search city and then the value property on this input element allows me to get the value

44

00:03:41,840  -->  00:03:43,140
the user inserted,

45

00:03:43,200  -->  00:03:49,320
so value is a property available on the input HTML element.

46

00:03:49,350  -->  00:03:57,860
Now with that to actually see something, I'll open up my Chrome dev tools and clear my console here

47

00:03:57,960  -->  00:04:02,670
and now I enter test and click on show weather and we see test.

48

00:04:02,790  -->  00:04:09,510
So this all works, I'm able to fetch this button to hook up an event listener and also to successfully

49

00:04:09,570  -->  00:04:11,370
output what the user entered here.

50

00:04:11,430  -->  00:04:17,490
That's great and with that, we got the very basics, we're able to retrieve the city name the user enters.

51

00:04:17,550  -->  00:04:24,060
Of course the next step is to somehow send the city name to a service which actually gives us the weather

52

00:04:24,390  -->  00:04:32,220
and then use that weather we get back in whichever form we will get back to actually output it here

53

00:04:32,240  -->  00:04:32,720
.

54

00:04:33,210  -->  00:04:35,580
Let's do this step-by-step in the next lectures.
