00:00:02.070  -->  00:00:07.590
Welcome to this Javascript bootcamp, where you will be able to dive into Javascript really

2

00:00:07.590  -->  00:00:14.400
quickly or if you already have the Javascript basics, go into individual topics and broad your

3

00:00:14.400  -->  00:00:19.200
knowledge, train it again, really go deep into Javascript.

4

00:00:19.200  -->  00:00:25.530
I chose a format which you will see in one of the next lectures where I'm sure I'm able to highlight

5

00:00:25.560  -->  00:00:32.160
individual topics and get you to understand those topics really quickly and therefore share my knowledge

6

00:00:32.160  -->  00:00:33.610
really efficiently

7

00:00:34.140  -->  00:00:36.860
but on what will I actually share my knowledge?

8

00:00:37.000  -->  00:00:39.020
Well I've got a lot of course content.

9

00:00:39.480  -->  00:00:44.720
We'll start the basics; variables, functions, operators, types and so on,

10

00:00:44.730  -->  00:00:50.250
so all the basics that make up Javascript and I will do this in a very condensed and comprehensive

11

00:00:50.250  -->  00:00:57.720
way so that if you're brand new to Javascript, you will be able to get started with it really quick and

12

00:00:57.720  -->  00:01:01.850
understand the core building parts of Javascript.

13

00:01:02.020  -->  00:01:07.490
Thereafter we'll have a detailed look at types and how Javascript scope works.

14

00:01:07.620  -->  00:01:14.070
Then we'll have a look at arrays since they are kind of a special type or a special object in Javascript

15

00:01:14.130  -->  00:01:21.840
and we'll use arrays quite a lot and Javascript offers a lot of useful functions too in conjunction with arrays

16

00:01:21.840  -->  00:01:22.550
.

17

00:01:22.830  -->  00:01:31.420
Then we'll have a look at Javascript objects which is a very important module since Javascript objects

18

00:01:31.420  -->  00:01:38.580
or this object oriented code in Javascript is a big part of Javascript and also something people

19

00:01:38.580  -->  00:01:40.160
sometimes struggle with

20

00:01:40.320  -->  00:01:42.490
but you will learn it's really easy

21

00:01:42.570  -->  00:01:48.650
and here we will dive into creating objects, using them and what prototypes are and so on,

22

00:01:48.780  -->  00:01:53.250
so a really cool module, I'm really looking forward to that.

23

00:01:53.460  -->  00:01:59.190
Sometimes though, code just doesn't run the way you want it to run, therefore I'll then follow this up with a

24

00:01:59.190  -->  00:02:05.670
module on errors and debugging which shows you how to debug your code, how to find what's causing an

25

00:02:05.670  -->  00:02:09.210
error and how to fix it of course.

26

00:02:09.230  -->  00:02:11.930
Thereafter, it's time to have a look at functions.

27

00:02:11.940  -->  00:02:16.950
Now I'm doing this in the basics module but there are some advanced topics or a little bit more advanced

28

00:02:16.950  -->  00:02:23.220
topics and therefore this functions module is there to pick up on those topics and dive deeper into functions.

29

00:02:23.820  -->  00:02:28.930
Once we're familiar with functions, it's time to have a look at some built-in functions and objects, so

30

00:02:28.960  -->  00:02:34.380
some built-in helpers Javascript offers you and some things you will probably also use quite a

31

00:02:34.380  -->  00:02:36.590
lot throughout your applications.

32

00:02:36.990  -->  00:02:41.380
And then it's finally time to have a look at the DOM, the document object model,

33

00:02:41.430  -->  00:02:48.210
so how to actually work with the webpage you're on, how to interact with elements, add new elements, change

34

00:02:48.240  -->  00:02:53.410
elements, how to interact with the window, change the location of the webpage and so on.

35

00:02:53.510  -->  00:03:00.030
So a really cool and core module here which will also use all the basics, all the things you learned

36

00:03:00.030  -->  00:03:06.830
in other modules before to then apply all that on a real page.

37

00:03:07.080  -->  00:03:10.700
But of course changing the DOM and so on is cool but it's not all,

38

00:03:10.710  -->  00:03:14.640
you also oftentimes need to react to events,

39

00:03:14.640  -->  00:03:20.190
this is why I'll have a whole module on events which shows you how to listen to events with different

40

00:03:20.460  -->  00:03:27.390
approaches, how to handle user events and how events behave and how you can change this

41

00:03:27.390  -->  00:03:28.310
behavior.

42

00:03:28.650  -->  00:03:35.860
That's before we'll have a look at Ajax which basically means sending HTTP requests from Javascript,

43

00:03:35.970  -->  00:03:43.020
so without leaving the page or reloading the page, a really important topic which is used in almost any

44

00:03:43.020  -->  00:03:49.740
modern web application which is some kind of live reloading feature which means reloading content without

45

00:03:49.740  -->  00:03:50.840
reloading the page

46

00:03:50.880  -->  00:03:53.220
and that's what you need Ajax for.

47

00:03:53.700  -->  00:03:58.820
And since learning all that is great and you will get tons of examples throughout these modules,

48

00:03:59.010  -->  00:04:05.820
it's also great and very important to have a project where those things come together and where you can see

49

00:04:05.820  -->  00:04:08.200
how they work with each other.

50

00:04:08.400  -->  00:04:12.760
That is why I'll have a little project at the end where we can see a lot of the things you learned throughout

51

00:04:12.810  -->  00:04:19.260
the course and if that's not enough for you, you'll also find additional information on third-party libraries

52

00:04:19.620  -->  00:04:20.870
and so on,

53

00:04:20.880  -->  00:04:26.190
so some additional content which should really help you get started with Javascript and continue your

54

00:04:26.190  -->  00:04:32.950
journey with it and dive deeper and deeper into it and write cool applications at the end.
