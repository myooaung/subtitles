1

00:00:02,010  -->  00:00:04,310
This course follows a special approach.

2

00:00:04,530  -->  00:00:07,210
I believe that you learn the most

3

00:00:07,290  -->  00:00:12,720
if I'm able to focus on one part of language at a time.

4

00:00:12,750  -->  00:00:17,850
Now oftentimes, you see courses where you learn certain features but you want to implement them in a webpage

5

00:00:18,270  -->  00:00:23,550
and therefore you need to write some other code which is not really connected to the topic you want

6

00:00:23,550  -->  00:00:25,280
to focus on right now,

7

00:00:25,500  -->  00:00:32,880
I think that's a problem because it deters you from really deeply diving into the topic at hand.

8

00:00:33,060  -->  00:00:37,160
Therefore the format I chose for this course is the following;

9

00:00:37,230  -->  00:00:40,710
we'll be using a webpage named jsbin.com.

10

00:00:40,770  -->  00:00:47,310
So if you navigate over there in your browser, you'll see that it should look something like this

11

00:00:47,310  -->  00:00:47,340
.

12

00:00:47,340  -->  00:00:54,360
Now it might look a bit different if you open up for the first time, you might close this blue thing

13

00:00:54,360  -->  00:00:59,670
you've got at the top when opening it for the first time and then make sure to only check Javascript

14

00:00:59,730  -->  00:01:04,170
and console here so that only these two items are highlighted.

15

00:01:04,170  -->  00:01:08,750
Now from time to time, I'll also use some HTML code and possibly the output

16

00:01:08,760  -->  00:01:16,230
but what this page allows you to do basically is to write a simple Javascript HTML program and see it

17

00:01:16,230  -->  00:01:17,490
run immediately,

18

00:01:17,490  -->  00:01:23,190
therefore we don't have any problems with setting up our workspace or having to write redundant code

19

00:01:23,190  -->  00:01:25,490
which isn't really the topic at hand.

20

00:01:25,890  -->  00:01:31,920
That being said of course, I have a separate module about setting up a workflow and setting up a real

21

00:01:31,920  -->  00:01:36,810
project because in, the end of course you won't be writing applications in this tool but it's great for

22

00:01:36,810  -->  00:01:42,250
learning and that's why I'm using it. For the majority of the course, we won't even see the HTML

23

00:01:42,640  -->  00:01:43,790
code,

24

00:01:43,800  -->  00:01:49,740
we'll use Javascript and see what happens in the Javascript console which is a convenient way to output

25

00:01:49,740  -->  00:01:51,000
values.

26

00:01:51,000  -->  00:01:55,100
Now you might argue my programs won't output it to the console,

27

00:01:55,110  -->  00:01:59,310
I need knowledge how to work with HTML code and you would be right

28

00:01:59,310  -->  00:02:06,270
but that is why I have a complete module or two actually about interacting with the HTML document

29

00:02:06,570  -->  00:02:10,670
but it's very important to understand all the other parts of the language first

30

00:02:10,680  -->  00:02:12,570
and for that you won't need HTML

31

00:02:12,660  -->  00:02:18,260
since it's only one part of the language and it's only about actually displaying it in the HTML

32

00:02:18,270  -->  00:02:24,240
code but not the logic you write, the logic you write depends on functions objects and data types and

33

00:02:24,240  -->  00:02:27,730
that can be perfectly output in the console like this.

34

00:02:27,870  -->  00:02:33,150
So for example you will see me type something like assigning a variable and of course, I'll

35

00:02:33,150  -->  00:02:35,500
come back to variables very soon

36

00:02:35,700  -->  00:02:39,900
and then logging that variable to the console log

37

00:02:40,110  -->  00:02:46,680
and if you then hit command enter here or click this run button, you'll see that it gets executed and

38

00:02:46,680  -->  00:02:51,570
gets printed to the console on the right which is a very convenient way to see what actually happened

39

00:02:51,630  -->  00:02:55,240
and what the result of a certain calculation might be.
