00:00:01,070  -->  00:00:05,780
I want to finish this topic on operators by talking about precedence.

2

00:00:05,970  -->  00:00:10,530
So this means which operator takes precedence over another one.

3

00:00:10,620  -->  00:00:17,660
I already showed this with the boolean operators and I want to come back to this. So I clear this and

4

00:00:17,700  -->  00:00:19,640
I get a and b which is fine

5

00:00:19,830  -->  00:00:28,390
and now I want to still log some thing and I want to log a + b * 2.

6

00:00:28,890  -->  00:00:31,880
Now what will we see if I hit run?

7

00:00:32,430  -->  00:00:36,380
Well we get 17 and this is pure mathematics here,

8

00:00:36,390  -->  00:00:42,720
you have a multiplication which comes first and then you add a to the result of this multiplication

9

00:00:42,720  -->  00:00:43,040
and

10

00:00:43,200  -->  00:00:48,870
of course a way to change this is by adding parentheses round a + b, which would now give you

11

00:00:48,870  -->  00:00:50,050
22.

12

00:00:50,640  -->  00:00:54,740
So that is good but you've got a lot of operators as you saw

13

00:00:54,990  -->  00:01:01,410
and it's not straightforward as with the boolean operators to learn which operators have precedence

14

00:01:01,470  -->  00:01:07,890
over other operators and a great way to find out is by simply and you will find this in a cheatsheet

15

00:01:07,890  -->  00:01:13,140
attached to this module as well, by simply googling for Javascript

16

00:01:15,510  -->  00:01:23,700
operator precedence and this will give you this article here from the MDN, the Mozilla Developer

17

00:01:23,700  -->  00:01:34,140
Network, where you will find a list of operators and their precedents, where the highest or the top element

18

00:01:34,140  -->  00:01:36,510
has the highest precedence here.

19

00:01:37,080  -->  00:01:40,390
So the higher the precedence number, the higher the precedents,

20

00:01:40,410  -->  00:01:47,970
so for example here, parentheses grouping has the highest precedence and we just saw this in action

21

00:01:48,390  -->  00:01:57,090
and if we scroll down, we see that division has this precedence, addition has this one of course

22

00:01:57,090  -->  00:02:00,400
lower than multiplication and division,

23

00:02:00,480  -->  00:02:03,600
that's basic mathematics and so on.

24

00:02:03,630  -->  00:02:12,380
So you may consult this list here to see how the different operators rank and also to learn which operators

25

00:02:12,400  -->  00:02:13,730
exists there.

26

00:02:13,740  -->  00:02:19,050
Now if you are shocked that these are a lot of operators and I haven't covered all of them right now,

27

00:02:19,060  -->  00:02:19,300
well

28

00:02:19,590  -->  00:02:21,900
a lot of them are operators

29

00:02:21,900  -->  00:02:24,570
you're probably not going to use that often

30

00:02:24,870  -->  00:02:26,740
and a lot of them are operators

31

00:02:26,790  -->  00:02:28,770
you will still see throughout this course.
