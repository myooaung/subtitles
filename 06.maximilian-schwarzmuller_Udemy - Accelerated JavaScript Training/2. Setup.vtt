00:00:00.990  -->  00:00:02.530
I'll use Plunker for that,

2

00:00:02.530  -->  00:00:10.740
so head over to plnkr.co, plnkr.co and then click on launch the editor.

3

00:00:10.740  -->  00:00:17.660
Now if you want to use your local set up, your local editor like Atom, Sublime, WebStorm, whatever,

4

00:00:17.730  -->  00:00:20.510
that's totally fine, it'll work the same,

5

00:00:20.520  -->  00:00:21.850
I'm just using it here

6

00:00:21.880  -->  00:00:26.950
to have a great way of having a workspace,

7

00:00:26.950  -->  00:00:29.300
everyone is able to start right away

8

00:00:29.310  -->  00:00:33.200
but of course this will work exactly the same on your local machine.

9

00:00:33.600  -->  00:00:36.320
You should see an editor which looks like that

10

00:00:36.690  -->  00:00:42.900
and well yes, that is what we'll be working with. We can create new files here on the left and we will do

11

00:00:42.900  -->  00:00:44.970
so throughout this project,

12

00:00:44.970  -->  00:00:48.450
here we can work in a file and here on the right,

13

00:00:48.450  -->  00:00:53.880
if we click on this eye, on live preview, we can see our running project.

14

00:00:53.970  -->  00:00:58.160
If we do need to refresh it for some reason and it should autorefresh

15

00:00:58.230  -->  00:01:02.040
but if we do need to refresh it, we can click this refresh

16

00:01:02.070  -->  00:01:08.590
icon here, this green one. Now with that, we should be able to start. The first thing I'll do is I'll change

17

00:01:08.590  -->  00:01:09.590
the styling.

18

00:01:09.660  -->  00:01:12.450
You see we already import the stylesheet here,

19

00:01:12.540  -->  00:01:16.580
so all I need to do is change it and I prepared some styles for that.

20

00:01:16.590  -->  00:01:22.230
Now of course you can find all the styles attached to this lecture, so you don't have to pause and write

21

00:01:22.270  -->  00:01:28.940
all of that but basically, that's just some styling I'll use throughout this project to give it a nice look.

22

00:01:28.950  -->  00:01:35.320
However since this is not really about styling or CSS, I'm just pasting this in here

23

00:01:35.490  -->  00:01:39.220
and yes as I said, you'll find it attached.

24

00:01:39.700  -->  00:01:43.030
Next I'll work on the index.html file

25

00:01:43.500  -->  00:01:46.530
and I also prepared some HTML code which you will find attached

26

00:01:46.530  -->  00:01:52.470
and all this code does is it will create this interface you see on the right but I'll go through it

27

00:01:52.470  -->  00:01:53.480
step-by-step.

28

00:01:53.490  -->  00:01:59.160
However, I haven't really mentioned what we are going to build and the app kind of shows it, we're building

29

00:01:59.160  -->  00:02:02.690
a really simple weather app where we can search for a city name,

30

00:02:02.690  -->  00:02:07.440
click on the show weather and then hopefully, we see some information about the weather in that city

31

00:02:07.460  -->  00:02:07.830
.

32

00:02:08.220  -->  00:02:15.750
So not too fancy but really nice and showcasing a lot of features we learned throughout this course.

33

00:02:15.750  -->  00:02:22.260
Therefore in the HTML code, I have my header and then I have this main section where I have my search area

34

00:02:22.260  -->  00:02:24.720
with the label, the input and the button

35

00:02:24.840  -->  00:02:29.880
and then I have this part here which we're not able to see right now because it's hidden by default

36

00:02:29.890  -->  00:02:30.150
.

37

00:02:30.420  -->  00:02:32.400
It's kind of a loading text

38

00:02:32.400  -->  00:02:38.010
and then the weather information with the city name, the weather description and the temperature

39

00:02:38.130  -->  00:02:44.610
and of course we will conditionally show and fill this with data with Javascript, so really looking

40

00:02:44.610  -->  00:02:47.250
forward to that.

41

00:02:47.250  -->  00:02:52.530
So right now if you click show weather, of course nothing happens because no scripting is going on.

42

00:02:52.620  -->  00:02:58.890
The first thing I'll do is, I'll remove the script tag here at the top and instead, add one right here

43

00:02:58.890  -->  00:03:02.160
at the bottom before exiting the body part.

44

00:03:02.160  -->  00:03:06.780
So I'll write script here and you can just type it and then hit tab to automatically create an

45

00:03:06.780  -->  00:03:08.430
opening and closing tag

46

00:03:08.730  -->  00:03:12.170
and here I will imported a script named app.js and

47

00:03:12.180  -->  00:03:19.200
I'll create that soon. So I'll go to my script.js and delete this file because I will create a new

48

00:03:19.200  -->  00:03:24.450
one which I'll name app.js here like that.

49

00:03:24.450  -->  00:03:33.030
Now in this app.js file, I want to hook up this button to fire an event,t so that we can actually

50

00:03:33.030  -->  00:03:40.470
see the weather or we can actually load the weather for a certain city and of course, I also want to do

51

00:03:40.470  -->  00:03:47.580
all the other logic, so reaching out to some service to fetch the weather and to then display it here

52

00:03:47.670  -->  00:03:49.510
on the web page.

53

00:03:49.620  -->  00:03:55.440
So with that, these are the basic preparations and in the next part, I'll actually dive into writing

54

00:03:55.440  -->  00:03:57.380
that code.
