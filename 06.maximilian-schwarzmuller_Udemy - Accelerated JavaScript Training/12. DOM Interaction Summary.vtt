00:00:01.530  -->  00:00:10.190
So this has been quite a lot of talking about selecting elements, editing them, creating them, inserting

2

00:00:10.200  -->  00:00:13.260
them, deleting them but it is important of course,

3

00:00:13.500  -->  00:00:20.040
this is what you'll often do in your applications and that is what creates a good user experience

4

00:00:20.040  -->  00:00:28.080
and what makes your pages so reactive and live updating, the possibility to change the page without having

5

00:00:28.080  -->  00:00:31.230
to reload it or get a new page from the server.

6

00:00:31.350  -->  00:00:37.230
Therefore it's of course important to understand this and I hope that you were able to understand how

7

00:00:37.230  -->  00:00:44.160
you can select elements, how you can change them, edit them, edit their attributes, their properties and

8

00:00:44.280  -->  00:00:49.880
how to create new ones, insert them, where to insert them and how to get rid of them in the end.

9

00:00:49.890  -->  00:00:53.660
And again, I can only say this as often as possible,

10

00:00:53.760  -->  00:00:59.130
check out the cheatsheet attached to this module which will give you some links to dive into this

11

00:00:59.130  -->  00:01:03.540
deeper, to find out all the properties certain elements have and so on

12

00:01:03.840  -->  00:01:09.090
if you're interested in this and otherwise just make your own little challenges. Challenge yourself

13

00:01:09.090  -->  00:01:14.580
that you want to select a specific element and then try out different ways of selecting it by using

14

00:01:14.580  -->  00:01:20.840
query selectors, by using traversal to select a higher level element and then travelling down to it,

15

00:01:21.120  -->  00:01:23.710
change it, change different properties,

16

00:01:23.730  -->  00:01:26.110
that really is what makes you better here

17

00:01:26.310  -->  00:01:34.090
and what will make you very comfortable with using all these methods and tools here.
