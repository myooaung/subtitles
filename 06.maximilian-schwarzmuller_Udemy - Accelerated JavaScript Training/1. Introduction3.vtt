00:00:01.260  -->  00:00:04.730
In this module, I want to have a look at arrays.

2

00:00:04.800  -->  00:00:09.540
We already played around with arrays a little bit but they're interesting enough to give them their

3

00:00:09.540  -->  00:00:10.580
own module.

4

00:00:11.010  -->  00:00:12.000
What is an array?

5

00:00:12.120  -->  00:00:13.690
Well you saw it before,

6

00:00:13.740  -->  00:00:17.770
it's basically something like this, a collection of items

7

00:00:17.850  -->  00:00:24.090
and important is that you have these square brackets around comma separated items to create such

8

00:00:24.090  -->  00:00:25.420
an array.

9

00:00:25.440  -->  00:00:32.640
Also important and also mentioned before but I just want to get it back into your memory at this point, this

10

00:00:32.640  -->  00:00:40.110
array here would have a length of three since it has three items but the index starts at zero,

11

00:00:40.110  -->  00:00:44.230
so the first item can be accessed through index 0,

12

00:00:44.250  -->  00:00:49.840
not 1 and therefore the last index in this array here would be 2 and not 3.

13

00:00:50.190  -->  00:00:52.680
So there are the basics about an array 

14

00:00:52.770  -->  00:00:58.160
but let's have a look at what we can do with arrays in Javascript.
