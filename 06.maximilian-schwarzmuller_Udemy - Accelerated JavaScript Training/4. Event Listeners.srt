1

00:00:01,310  -->  00:00:05,970
So I was promising this alternative and I'll get rid of the two handlers here at first.

2

00:00:06,390  -->  00:00:09,900
So the alternative I'm talking of are event listeners.

3

00:00:09,900  -->  00:00:16,560
Now while this might sound similar to event handlers, it's different thing in Javascript. I'll first

4

00:00:16,560  -->  00:00:22,010
create two functions and I'll name the first one listener1, that's a normal function here

5

00:00:22,380  -->  00:00:30,270
and in this function, I'll say listener 1, just log listener 1 to the console and then I'll quickly copy

6

00:00:30,270  -->  00:00:34,000
that function to create listener2.

7

00:00:34,050  -->  00:00:36,540
So these are my two listener functions

8

00:00:36,750  -->  00:00:40,880
and now I want to add them as event listeners to my code.

9

00:00:40,980  -->  00:00:46,960
I can therefore take my button and use the addEventListener method on it.

10

00:00:47,190  -->  00:00:52,770
addEventListener is a method available on each HTML element and it does exactly what the name implies,

11

00:00:52,770  -->  00:00:52,860
it

12

00:00:52,860  -->  00:00:55,900
allows me to add an event listener to it.

13

00:00:56,010  -->  00:01:02,790
The first argument this method expects is the name of the event I want to listen to, click for example

14

00:01:02,790  -->  00:01:03,060
.

15

00:01:03,240  -->  00:01:08,910
So the name is equal to the name you saw in the event handler but without the on at the beginning, just

16

00:01:08,950  -->  00:01:10,310
event name here.

17

00:01:10,680  -->  00:01:14,790
The second argument is a reference to the function I want to execute

18

00:01:14,790  -->  00:01:18,870
if this event fires, if this event is recognized,

19

00:01:18,870  -->  00:01:20,680
listener 1 for example here.

20

00:01:20,940  -->  00:01:22,890
Notice that I don't have parentheses here,

21

00:01:22,890  -->  00:01:25,330
I don't want to execute the function right away,

22

00:01:25,380  -->  00:01:30,020
I just want to set up a link to the function.

23

00:01:30,060  -->  00:01:35,270
Now if I run this and click on click me, what do you think we'll see?

24

00:01:35,270  -->  00:01:37,940
We see listener 1, so this works,

25

00:01:37,950  -->  00:01:42,190
the cool thing is I can now also add another listener, listener2.

26

00:01:42,370  -->  00:01:46,130
If I click on run and I clear this and now I click click me,

27

00:01:46,500  -->  00:01:49,020
you see we see both listeners all the time

28

00:01:49,050  -->  00:01:51,010
which of course is great.

29

00:01:51,090  -->  00:01:56,420
Now let's say we want to remove one listener after a certain amount of time.

30

00:01:57,240  -->  00:02:09,780
So I'm clearing this and then I'll add a setTimeout function here and after two seconds, let's say

31

00:02:09,870  -->  00:02:18,300
I want to execute the function I'm going to specify now. In this anonymous function here,

32

00:02:18,830  -->  00:02:23,860
I want to revoke one of the event listeners, remove one of the event listeners.

33

00:02:24,120  -->  00:02:30,300
Well thankfully, I have the removeEventListener method.

34

00:02:30,300  -->  00:02:36,840
Now you might expect that I simply pass the listener reference here, so the name of the function which

35

00:02:36,840  -->  00:02:39,990
I want to remove and I'm done but that is not the case

36

00:02:40,020  -->  00:02:41,630
and why is it not the case?

37

00:02:41,970  -->  00:02:46,780
Well the function which gets executed is not the only thing defining the event,

38

00:02:46,980  -->  00:02:49,480
the type of event is also important

39

00:02:49,650  -->  00:02:54,990
because imagine you were listening to another event here too where you also execute listener1

40

00:02:55,200  -->  00:03:01,110
but you were listening to the mouse enter event. If you would remove event listeners only by function,

41

00:03:01,500  -->  00:03:05,460
then you would remove this listener from the click and mouse enter event

42

00:03:05,700  -->  00:03:07,140
but maybe you don't want to do that,

43

00:03:07,140  -->  00:03:10,340
you want to remove it from the click and listener 1 event.

44

00:03:10,680  -->  00:03:17,760
Therefore removeEventListener expects the same arguments as addEventListener does. So

45

00:03:17,780  -->  00:03:22,950
I'll set up this to be a click event and then the listener I want to remove.

46

00:03:23,520  -->  00:03:29,700
Now if I click on run with Javascript and then I click this button, you'll see listener 1 and 2 and then

47

00:03:29,700  -->  00:03:36,090
after a couple of seconds, you'll see I only get listener 2 because now listener 1 was removed due to

48

00:03:36,090  -->  00:03:37,710
this timer being done.
