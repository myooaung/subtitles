1

00:00:01,230  -->  00:00:03,250
We covered a lot.

2

00:00:03,390  -->  00:00:09,150
I hope you have a clear understanding of the different features Javascript offers, how they work

3

00:00:09,150  -->  00:00:17,510
together and which power Javascript offers to you, how you can really enhance your applications or build

4

00:00:17,520  -->  00:00:21,270
front-end focused applications with Javascript.

5

00:00:21,270  -->  00:00:28,860
How you can interact with the user and the DOM, how you can change the structure of the page and overall,

6

00:00:28,890  -->  00:00:31,950
how to work with Javascript.

7

00:00:31,950  -->  00:00:34,740
Now what are the next steps you could take?

8

00:00:34,980  -->  00:00:41,820
Well a good step of course is to dive deeper, to practice, to pick example applications,

9

00:00:41,820  -->  00:00:46,440
think about what you might want to build and then try to build it with Javascript.

10

00:00:46,500  -->  00:00:52,450
Also you might have a look at some of the libraries like jQuery or any other Javascript library

11

00:00:52,620  -->  00:00:57,990
and of course, it's also a great idea to have a look at some of the Javascript frameworks, like for example

12

00:00:58,020  -->  00:01:05,340
Angular 2 or ReactJS. You might also want to have a look at my ES6 bootcamp which will

13

00:01:05,340  -->  00:01:09,300
teach you the new features introduced by ES6.

14

00:01:09,450  -->  00:01:15,270
Whatever you do, I'll be happy to welcome you in any other future courses or lectures or whatever.

15

00:01:15,270  -->  00:01:16,400
Have a great day,

16

00:01:16,570  -->  00:01:16,850
bye.
