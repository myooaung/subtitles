1

00:00:01,760  -->  00:00:08,400
Before learning those more convenient ways, it's however important to understand how you can navigate between

2

00:00:08,430  -->  00:00:09,840
elements in the DOM

3

00:00:10,050  -->  00:00:15,680
and as I said for example you can chain children calls like this.

4

00:00:15,930  -->  00:00:19,350
So if I log this again, console log

5

00:00:22,230  -->  00:00:26,620
and I'm accessing the first child of this block here,

6

00:00:26,640  -->  00:00:27,660
so body

7

00:00:27,780  -->  00:00:35,340
and then the first child and then the first child of that accessed element, well the first child of

8

00:00:35,380  -->  00:00:41,160
this body part is of course the unordered list and then the first child of the unordered list is this

9

00:00:41,160  -->  00:00:42,600
list item.

10

00:00:42,600  -->  00:00:51,930
So if I now print this to the console, you'll see indeed that what we now selected is a list item which

11

00:00:51,990  -->  00:00:53,740
as a content has a link

12

00:00:53,730  -->  00:01:02,310
by the way because it has this content of a link. You may not only access all your elements with

13

00:01:02,310  -->  00:01:06,760
this array and then the index, if you for example want the first child,

14

00:01:06,840  -->  00:01:10,090
you can use first child like this.

15

00:01:10,120  -->  00:01:14,920
Now if I get rid of children, what do you think we'll see if I hit run?

16

00:01:16,650  -->  00:01:21,530
Well you probably expected to get the unordered list here,

17

00:01:21,600  -->  00:01:25,320
however instead we get something else and I'll tell you what we

18

00:01:25,320  -->  00:01:33,160
got, we get the whitespace before the unordered list because this is the first child.

19

00:01:33,180  -->  00:01:34,530
Now you might say, that's stupid,

20

00:01:34,530  -->  00:01:40,050
I'm not interested in that, I want to get the first element here no matter if there is a whitespace

21

00:01:40,050  -->  00:01:47,090
in front of it or not and you can select it with the first element child property here.

22

00:01:47,190  -->  00:01:53,300
If I now hit run, you get the unordered list here as you can see,

23

00:01:53,370  -->  00:02:01,310
so now you're selecting this. Of course you also have the last element child.

24

00:02:01,330  -->  00:02:06,240
Now if I clear this, what do you expect we'll now get?

25

00:02:08,730  -->  00:02:15,630
Well here, we get a script element which we can't see here but again, that's something JSBin entered

26

00:02:15,630  -->  00:02:21,690
for us but of course normally, you would also get the unordered lists because it's the first and last child, there

27

00:02:21,690  -->  00:02:25,980
are no other direct child to body, only the nested ones in unordered list

28

00:02:26,010  -->  00:02:32,700
but when we're talking about the body here, we only got the unordered list here. We also can for

29

00:02:32,700  -->  00:02:35,700
example select the first element child,

30

00:02:35,910  -->  00:02:44,640
then the first element child to get the first list item and then the next element sibling.

31

00:02:44,960  -->  00:02:52,950
What do you think we'll now get? We get a list item and to see which one we get,

32

00:02:52,950  -->  00:02:57,990
I'll change text so that they don't all have the same text inside the links.

33

00:02:57,990  -->  00:03:02,030
So if I run this again, you see we get Link2.

34

00:03:02,460  -->  00:03:08,220
So we get the second list item here which makes sense since we're selecting the first element child

35

00:03:08,220  -->  00:03:10,760
of our body, which is the unordered list,

36

00:03:11,130  -->  00:03:17,100
then the first element child inside this unordered list which is this list item and then the next element

37

00:03:17,100  -->  00:03:22,490
sibling of this which is of course this one, this is the next element sibling of this list item.

38

00:03:22,890  -->  00:03:28,550
And this is how you can traverse inside the DOM, how you can move between different objects with

39

00:03:28,550  -->  00:03:29,000
these

40

00:03:29,070  -->  00:03:34,680
first element child next to element sibling and so on methods.

41

00:03:34,980  -->  00:03:39,330
If I select the first element child and again, the first element child,

42

00:03:39,330  -->  00:03:45,930
so if I select this item but now I'm not using the next element sibling but instead, the parent element,

43

00:03:46,860  -->  00:03:53,940
if I now hit run, well I get the unordered list again because I'm selecting the first element child which

44

00:03:53,940  -->  00:04:01,350
is on unordered list, then the first element child which is the list item and then the parent element again

45

00:04:01,410  -->  00:04:04,930
and the parent element of this list item of course is the unordered list.

46

00:04:05,130  -->  00:04:14,490
So I took a step into this and then one back out and again, this is how you can traverse here and with

47

00:04:14,490  -->  00:04:19,290
this traversal, you should be able to select whichever element you need to select because you want

48

00:04:19,290  -->  00:04:21,330
to change something.
