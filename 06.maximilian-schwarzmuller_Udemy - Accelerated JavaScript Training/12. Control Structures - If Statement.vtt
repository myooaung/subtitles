00:00:01.110  -->  00:00:06.450
Now I was speaking about the browser executing the code immediately at the end of the last lecture,

2

00:00:07.440  -->  00:00:16.440
you can control the flow of the code execution with control structures. Control structures basically

3

00:00:16.770  -->  00:00:22.640
allow you to tell the browser when to execute certain code or execute certain code more often than once,

4

00:00:22.640  -->  00:00:22.990
so

5

00:00:23.010  -->  00:00:32.070
really useful tools you have in your toolbox for creating awesome applications. A very common and

6

00:00:32.580  -->  00:00:39.090
wide known control structure is the if statement which basically allows you to run some code conditionally

7

00:00:39.100  -->  00:00:39.500
.

8

00:00:40.020  -->  00:00:45.240
So I'll create a new variable and I'll name it condition and I will set it to true,

9

00:00:45.240  -->  00:00:52.560
so this is a boolean variable here and then I'll create an if statement by writing if and then the condition

10

00:00:52.560  -->  00:00:54.930
between parentheses here.

11

00:00:55.220  -->  00:01:02.220
Now as you later see when I come to operators, you can also can compare certain values here but here,

12

00:01:02.270  -->  00:01:08.660
I'll just check if condition and with condition, of course I'm referring to this variable here.

13

00:01:08.970  -->  00:01:16.360
Now an if statement which I then create by adding curly braces expects

14

00:01:16.370  -->  00:01:18.400
true or false,

15

00:01:18.510  -->  00:01:25.320
these are the only two values with which an if statement can work because it's checking if this is true,

16

00:01:25.650  -->  00:01:30.410
then execute whatever is between these parentheses or these curly braces,

17

00:01:30.410  -->  00:01:36.550
excuse me, if this is false, the code between here will not get executed.

18

00:01:37.320  -->  00:01:45.660
So if I now log something here, for example executed, well I think this is pretty straightforward but what

19

00:01:45.660  -->  00:01:48.040
will we see if I hit run?

20

00:01:48.650  -->  00:01:52.410
Well we see executed because I'm checking if condition is true

21

00:01:52.410  -->  00:01:58.290
and of course condition is true because I'm setting it here and on the other hand of course, if I set

22

00:01:58.290  -->  00:02:06.990
this to false and I hit run, we see nothing because this code is now not executed. Sometimes, we also

23

00:02:06.990  -->  00:02:09.930
want to check if something is true

24

00:02:10.140  -->  00:02:15.720
but we want to provide or execute some other code if the condition is not met.

25

00:02:15.930  -->  00:02:21.900
We can therefore add the else keyword and then curly braces after it again.

26

00:02:22.290  -->  00:02:26.510
So now we execute this code if the condition is true

27

00:02:27.090  -->  00:02:33.290
but if the condition is not true, so if it is false, we'll reach this code here.

28

00:02:33.390  -->  00:02:36.880
What do you think we'll now see if I hit run?

29

00:02:37.270  -->  00:02:40.700
Well we still see executed because it's still set to true

30

00:02:40.830  -->  00:02:49.890
but if I change this to false and hit run again, you now see we get not executed because now we're reaching

31

00:02:49.890  -->  00:02:52.780
this else part here.

32

00:02:52.960  -->  00:02:56.070
There's also another thing we could specify,

33

00:02:56.070  -->  00:02:59.210
else/if.

34

00:02:59.250  -->  00:03:05.520
Now why will you specify else/if if we only can handle true or false?

35

00:03:06.000  -->  00:03:10.330
Well sometimes, we want to check multiple conditions for being true,

36

00:03:10.410  -->  00:03:13.060
so for example here we check if condition is true

37

00:03:13.170  -->  00:03:22.200
and then we print this code but if condition is false, we want to check if another condition is true

38

00:03:23.040  -->  00:03:25.920
and if another condition is true and we check this here,

39

00:03:29.370  -->  00:03:31.170
we execute this code

40

00:03:31.380  -->  00:03:39.370
and if this would be false too, then we would log not executed.

41

00:03:39.570  -->  00:03:43.950
So now we're first checking if this condition is true and if this is the case, we will execute this

42

00:03:43.960  -->  00:03:44.320
but

43

00:03:44.790  -->  00:03:49.530
if this is not the case, we'll check if at least this condition is true in which case we would execute

44

00:03:49.530  -->  00:03:50.440
this code

45

00:03:51.030  -->  00:03:55.690
and if all of that is not true, well then we reached the else part here.

46

00:03:55.710  -->  00:04:00.660
So what do you think we'll see now? Well we get still executed

47

00:04:00.840  -->  00:04:06.180
because we're not meeting the first condition since this is false but we do meet the second condition

48

00:04:06.180  -->  00:04:07.240
since this is true,

49

00:04:07.380  -->  00:04:09.840
therefore we get still executed.

50

00:04:09.840  -->  00:04:15.260
If I set this to false, we'll get not executed,

51

00:04:15.270  -->  00:04:16.860
so we're in the else part then.
