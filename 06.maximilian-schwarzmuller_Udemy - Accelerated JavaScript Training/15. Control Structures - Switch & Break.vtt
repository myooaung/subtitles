00:00:01.740  -->  00:00:04.110
Now what's up with this break

2

00:00:04.110  -->  00:00:05.600
keyword here?

3

00:00:06.150  -->  00:00:13.560
Well I best show it by leaving it out, so I'll remove break in all these places

4

00:00:13.800  -->  00:00:21.870
and what do you think we'll now see if I execute this with a number of one for example?

5

00:00:22.710  -->  00:00:32.670
We get all three values because now the value falls through, this is how it's called. It reaches this point

6

00:00:32.670  -->  00:00:39.330
because we have a case of one but then it just continues execution from top to bottom like Javascript

7

00:00:39.330  -->  00:00:41.110
code is executed.

8

00:00:41.370  -->  00:00:47.730
So it's not considering that we have case here and that this would be a different case, it's just executing

9

00:00:47.730  -->  00:00:52.380
all the code and basically ignoring this case 8 and default thing here.

10

00:00:52.890  -->  00:01:00.900
So if I enter 8, what do you think we'll now see if all we got is eight and default?

11

00:01:00.960  -->  00:01:10.290
Maybe you were expecting to also see is one but it's still checking which case is the case,

12

00:01:10.320  -->  00:01:15.050
so eight here but then it continues executing to the bottom.

13

00:01:15.090  -->  00:01:16.890
It's not doing it right from the beginning,

14

00:01:16.890  -->  00:01:18.270
just we don't have breaks here

15

00:01:18.360  -->  00:01:22.720
but once it found its case, it will continue and not stop.

16

00:01:22.770  -->  00:01:32.370
So by adding break, we're basically telling Javascript that we want it to finish execution at this point

17

00:01:32.880  -->  00:01:35.690
and not continue with the next lines here,

18

00:01:35.880  -->  00:01:39.270
so we break out of the condition now so to say.
