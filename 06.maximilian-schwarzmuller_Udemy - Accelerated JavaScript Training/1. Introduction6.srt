00:00:01,430  -->  00:00:07,390
So all the core basics have been covered and now there's one big thing missing,

2

00:00:07,500  -->  00:00:13,610
introducing the document object model, so the DOM, the HTML code and the interaction between Javascript and

3

00:00:13,900  -->  00:00:20,410
the HTML code because in the end, your application will probably need some kind of interaction,

4

00:00:20,460  -->  00:00:28,800
you probably want to change the HTML code during runtime or evaluate certain elements and this is why

5

00:00:28,800  -->  00:00:32,310
this is so important and we're finally here.

6

00:00:32,310  -->  00:00:35,100
So what is the document object model?

7

00:00:35,550  -->  00:00:37,190
Let's have a look at a browser page

8

00:00:37,200  -->  00:00:41,780
and here you see the MDN, the Mozilla Developer Network.

9

00:00:41,880  -->  00:00:49,440
If we have a look at this page, we have the window object which is the complete window or specifically,

10

00:00:49,680  -->  00:00:58,410
the tab which is opened here which holds our browser bar with the location for example, as well as

11

00:00:58,410  -->  00:01:00,230
the page we're seeing.

12

00:01:00,630  -->  00:01:04,260
Speaking of the browser bar, this is the location we're at

13

00:01:04,260  -->  00:01:07,760
and we have access to that on the window object.

14

00:01:08,000  -->  00:01:09,990
This is one important thing

15

00:01:10,050  -->  00:01:12,100
the window object stores for us,

16

00:01:12,120  -->  00:01:14,390
this location object

17

00:01:14,730  -->  00:01:18,520
but the other important thing of course is the DOM,

18

00:01:18,540  -->  00:01:20,220
the document here.

19

00:01:20,220  -->  00:01:26,160
So all the rendered HTML code or not only the rendered, the HTML code itself

20

00:01:26,520  -->  00:01:32,880
and notice that I say HTML code here, just to make it easier to think about it

21

00:01:32,940  -->  00:01:40,580
but technically the browser took the HTML code and created the DOM, the document object model of that

22

00:01:41,430  -->  00:01:48,510
and I'll show you this back in JSBin if I open up the developer tools. Here

23

00:01:48,540  -->  00:01:52,190
if you click on elements and you can do this on any page you visit,

24

00:01:52,320  -->  00:01:53,780
this is the DOM,

25

00:01:53,940  -->  00:01:56,740
this here. It looks like the HTML

26

00:01:56,790  -->  00:01:59,560
and of course it is the HTML written

27

00:01:59,970  -->  00:02:04,390
but it is what the browser created of this HTML code

28

00:02:04,710  -->  00:02:10,620
and with the developer tools, you have a pretty cool way to accessing it and having a look at your DOM

29

00:02:10,620  -->  00:02:14,010
and all the properties and the styling and so on,

30

00:02:14,010  -->  00:02:19,260
so that it's really useful and certainly interesting to use on some bigger pages to see how everything

31

00:02:19,260  -->  00:02:21,890
was set up there for example. In Chrome

32

00:02:21,890  -->  00:02:27,350
by the way, you could even change this during runtime by going in there and typing into it

33

00:02:27,570  -->  00:02:29,440
but I'm not going to do that here.

34

00:02:29,930  -->  00:02:31,600
So this is the DOM

35

00:02:31,770  -->  00:02:37,380
and we can work with the DOM, we can interact with it as we can by the way with the location and so on

36

00:02:37,890  -->  00:02:42,320
and I'll show you this in the next lectures.
