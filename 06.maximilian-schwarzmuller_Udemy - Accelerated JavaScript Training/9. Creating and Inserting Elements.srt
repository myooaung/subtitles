00:00:01,890  -->  00:00:08,020
So we saw how to get elements, how to change them

2

00:00:08,250  -->  00:00:13,500
but sometimes we also want to create or destroy elements, so let's have a look at this.

3

00:00:13,530  -->  00:00:16,560
I create a new element by creating a new variable here

4

00:00:17,310  -->  00:00:22,740
and let's say we want to create a paragraph, so I'll just name it p here.

5

00:00:23,430  -->  00:00:32,350
Then I can use document.createElement and then as an argument, the tag name p, capital p here

6

00:00:32,490  -->  00:00:41,080
since we're creating a paragraph. With that, we already created the element, it's not being added to the DOM

7

00:00:41,080  -->  00:00:44,270
right now but it's there, it's an HTML element,

8

00:00:44,500  -->  00:00:52,970
therefore I can also access the text content and set it to a new paragraph.

9

00:00:53,070  -->  00:01:04,960
I can also style it, so I could set the font size to let's say 6 or 17 pixels here since I mistyped

10

00:01:05,190  -->  00:01:06,110
.

11

00:01:06,180  -->  00:01:11,750
So we have the element and we can prove that it's there by logging it to the console.

12

00:01:12,180  -->  00:01:18,470
So if I close my output for a second and open the console instead and if I hit run,

13

00:01:18,510  -->  00:01:23,080
you see this is the paragraph element here, new paragraph, tag name p

14

00:01:23,160  -->  00:01:24,850
so it's there,

15

00:01:24,870  -->  00:01:27,590
however let's add it to the output.

16

00:01:28,050  -->  00:01:33,560
We have to decide where we want to add it and let's say to make this a bit more difficult,

17

00:01:33,720  -->  00:01:36,580
we want to add it after this link here.

18

00:01:36,930  -->  00:01:43,910
Well as a first step, let's select the element where we want to insert it after, so this link.

19

00:01:44,170  -->  00:01:53,460
I'll save this in a new variable and then I'll just use a query selector here to get this link here

20

00:01:53,470  -->  00:01:53,540
.

21

00:01:53,610  -->  00:02:00,000
It's the first anchor tag, therefore I can use query selector and choose a as a tag name to select

22

00:02:00,000  -->  00:02:00,510
this one.

23

00:02:03,900  -->  00:02:08,930
I then want to insert this newly created paragraph after this link

24

00:02:09,390  -->  00:02:12,330
and I can use this anchor tag

25

00:02:12,330  -->  00:02:15,700
I just selected which already sits in a DOM and

26

00:02:15,810  -->  00:02:21,540
then the append child method and I want to append this paragraph.

27

00:02:21,540  -->  00:02:30,300
So let's see what happens if I now hit run, well a new paragraph gets added but it looks like it's

28

00:02:30,300  -->  00:02:31,400
part of this link

29

00:02:31,410  -->  00:02:38,030
so let's have a look at these in the Chrome dev tools. Here under elements,

30

00:02:38,190  -->  00:02:44,920
if we increase this a bit, you see it's part of the anchor tag and not really appended after it

31

00:02:44,940  -->  00:02:45,410
and

32

00:02:45,750  -->  00:02:50,450
that is because the append child will add it to the current element,

33

00:02:50,450  -->  00:02:51,570
so inside of it,

34

00:02:51,570  -->  00:02:56,890
so it appended it after the text, inside of this anchor tag.

35

00:02:57,000  -->  00:02:58,240
However we wanted it to add it

36

00:02:58,260  -->  00:03:00,560
after this link, not inside of it.

37

00:03:00,690  -->  00:03:07,890
Now since append child simply takes the element and adds it inside of the element but at the end of

38

00:03:07,890  -->  00:03:09,580
all the child elements,

39

00:03:09,750  -->  00:03:15,360
we can simply select the list items of the anchor

40

00:03:16,050  -->  00:03:22,220
and if we now hit run, a new paragraph is actually inserted after the link.

41

00:03:22,260  -->  00:03:27,900
So it's important to understand, append child with append it and it's not that difficult to understand

42

00:03:27,900  -->  00:03:35,490
if you look at the name as a child but at the end of all the other children. What if we wanted to append

43

00:03:35,490  -->  00:03:37,640
this paragraph in the list item

44

00:03:37,650  -->  00:03:45,850
but before the link? To do this, we have the insertBefore method here.

45

00:03:46,500  -->  00:03:55,680
Now with insertBefore however, if I run it, that doesn't really work because we're not really specifying

46

00:03:55,680  -->  00:03:59,560
before which item we want to insert it, right? We're just telling

47

00:03:59,560  -->  00:04:07,650
OK in the list item, insert the paragraph before, before what? So we also need to get the element before we want

48

00:04:07,650  -->  00:04:08,360
to insert it,

49

00:04:08,490  -->  00:04:13,790
so the anchor. Now I could use a query selector to get the first anchor or since

50

00:04:13,800  -->  00:04:17,790
I know it is the first child of my list item,

51

00:04:17,820  -->  00:04:27,390
I can just use first element child here and then just insert it before this anchor tag which I selected

52

00:04:27,390  -->  00:04:27,820
here.

53

00:04:28,020  -->  00:04:32,680
So if I now run this, you see the paragraph gets actually added before the link.

54

00:04:33,120  -->  00:04:40,290
So this is how you can add your elements in different places in your document with the append child

55

00:04:40,320  -->  00:04:47,100
and insertBefore method and by selecting the elements where you want to select it to define the position

56

00:04:47,100  -->  00:04:48,400
where it should get entered.

57

00:04:48,660  -->  00:04:53,330
And of course create element is an important method to actually create a new element

58

00:04:53,520  -->  00:04:58,180
and don't forget, once you executed this method, the element is there,

59

00:04:58,200  -->  00:05:04,950
it's stored in this variable here and therefore you can access all the properties this object or

60

00:05:04,950  -->  00:05:08,400
this element would have if it were already in the DOM as well

61

00:05:08,400  -->  00:05:14,640
even though it hasn't been attached to the DOM yet and then use append child and insertBefore to

62

00:05:14,700  -->  00:05:16,070
actually insert it.

63

00:05:16,620  -->  00:05:20,580
So that has been how you insert an element, but how do you delete one?
