00:00:01.070  -->  00:00:04.190
Now to finish this course, here's one other aspect

2

00:00:04.230  -->  00:00:11.330
I really want to talk about; libraries, frameworks and modularity. And so now you learned what makes up Javascript

3

00:00:11.340  -->  00:00:11.670
and

4

00:00:11.700  -->  00:00:15.030
this is of course very important and what this course is all about.

5

00:00:15.030  -->  00:00:17.430
I want to give you the basics of Javascript,

6

00:00:17.460  -->  00:00:23.400
I want you to learn what Javascript is and how it works. Oftentimes in your projects,

7

00:00:23.400  -->  00:00:31.620
you'll probably use some libraries or at least add some libraries or complete frameworks or you might

8

00:00:31.620  -->  00:00:38.430
have a project which is so big and has so many code lines, so many different modules you'd

9

00:00:38.430  -->  00:00:45.030
like to have that you simply run into problems with having just a couple of Javascript files which you

10

00:00:45.030  -->  00:00:51.090
import in your page with the script tags and you would love to have some kind of modularity

11

00:00:51.090  -->  00:00:56.550
like you know it from other languages which is where you have different pieces of your app in different

12

00:00:56.550  -->  00:00:59.540
files and then you just import them from each other

13

00:00:59.670  -->  00:01:01.940
and when the app runs, everything is pulled together.

14

00:01:02.020  -->  00:01:07.480
Javascript doesn't offer this functionality, so I'll come back to this question too.
