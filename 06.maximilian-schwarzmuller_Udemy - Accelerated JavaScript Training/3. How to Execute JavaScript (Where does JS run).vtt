Before we actually start, let's talk about one very important thing,

2

00:00:06.030  -->  00:00:08.540
where does Javascript actually run?

3

00:00:08.560  -->  00:00:11.590
Now you might know this, in this case just feel free to skip ahead

4

00:00:11.700  -->  00:00:15.070
but if you're not 100% sure about this, here you go.

5

00:00:15.150  -->  00:00:21.990
Javascript typically runs in the browser, which means when you load a webpage, Javascript is not executed

6

00:00:21.990  -->  00:00:27.040
on a server from which the webpage comes but instead in your browser.

7

00:00:27.270  -->  00:00:33.020
That's why Javascript is so popular these days because it allows you to create very good and reactive

8

00:00:33.030  -->  00:00:37.730
user experiences since it doesn't depend on some kind of server responding in time

9

00:00:37.830  -->  00:00:42.200
but it runs in the browser, there where the user is using it,

10

00:00:42.210  -->  00:00:49.060
there is no closer way or no closer place to execute code and therefore Javascript is very powerful

11

00:00:49.070  -->  00:00:49.310
.

12

00:00:49.740  -->  00:00:55.410
But there also is the chance to run it on a server with NodeJS which is a server-side language based

13

00:00:55.410  -->  00:00:56.650
on Javascript.

14

00:00:56.670  -->  00:01:03.660
Now in this course, I'll clearly focus on the browser part but many of the concepts you learned here,

15

00:01:03.870  -->  00:01:10.420
indeed all of the very basics of Javascript and how it works will of course also apply to the server

16

00:01:10.430  -->  00:01:10.480
in

17

00:01:10.500  -->  00:01:17.820
NodeJS. NodeJS extends the language and offers other features as well but the core language of

18

00:01:17.820  -->  00:01:22.920
course is Javascript and therefore, the things you learned in this course are relevant for this

19

00:01:22.980  -->  00:01:24.760
as well.
