00:00:00.390 --> 00:00:05.320
Hello and welcome to part to training the eye with deep convolutional kuning.

2
00:00:05.490 --> 00:00:06.240
That's right.

3
00:00:06.240 --> 00:00:11.550
Now that we built the AI AI with the architecture of the neural network the body the way the actions

4
00:00:11.550 --> 00:00:12.830
are played and everything.

5
00:00:12.840 --> 00:00:17.040
It's time to train say I with deep convolutional Cuellar.

6
00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:21.100
So that's from now that we will implement you know experience replay.

7
00:00:21.210 --> 00:00:23.770
Working with the values working with words.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.820
And there's even going to be a bonus which will improve a lot.

9
00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:33.870
The training process and that is called eligibility trace eligibility trace is a powerful technique

10
00:00:34.110 --> 00:00:41.880
which consists of accumulating the word over several steps and the cube values are learned on this accumulation

11
00:00:41.880 --> 00:00:46.860
of words as opposed to before where the cube values were learned after each transition.

12
00:00:46.860 --> 00:00:52.800
Therefore after getting each word this time we will be learning the values after getting several rewards

13
00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.480
instead of just one word.

14
00:00:54.660 --> 00:01:00.530
So instead of having one transition after the other and you know updating the Q value each time.

15
00:01:00.660 --> 00:01:07.620
Well the q values are going to be updated every steps because eligibility traces radicals and steps

16
00:01:07.710 --> 00:01:13.500
eligibility trace and end is this number after which the q values are going to be updated and in our

17
00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:13.820
model.

18
00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:15.600
Here we are going to have any calls then.

19
00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:21.570
So that means that will be 10 steps eligibility trace and therefore we will update and learn the q values

20
00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:22.880
every 10 steps.

21
00:01:22.890 --> 00:01:26.820
After accumulating the words on these 10 steps so that's a bonus.

22
00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:32.400
That will make our model even more powerful and you will see that in the end we will get outstanding

23
00:01:32.400 --> 00:01:33.180
results.

24
00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:36.020
I was really amazed when I saw the final result.

25
00:01:36.030 --> 00:01:40.430
I used to work on Merle's that took a lot of time to execute.

26
00:01:40.430 --> 00:01:45.780
You know the AI took a lot of time to train but you will see that with this one plus the neural network

27
00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:46.640
that we made.

28
00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.390
That is our brain and our body here with stuff.

29
00:01:49.390 --> 00:01:55.740
Next we will get a very powerful mob and therefore very powerful AI because you will see that it will

30
00:01:55.740 --> 00:01:56.600
really cure lies.

31
00:01:56.610 --> 00:01:59.090
Do you understand what I'm talking about.

32
00:01:59.370 --> 00:02:05.440
So as you can see in this part 2 we are starting by getting the Dume environment and actually prepared

33
00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.740
the lines of code for you.

34
00:02:06.780 --> 00:02:12.790
We are just using the image pre-processing external file from a working directory folder.

35
00:02:12.930 --> 00:02:19.520
So basically the order is rather to first take this line of code doesn't that make it in court.

36
00:02:19.590 --> 00:02:24.450
0 0 is the name of the environment of the game we're playing.

37
00:02:24.450 --> 00:02:30.930
So first we import the environment with this gem that make That's what you can find on the open page

38
00:02:30.930 --> 00:02:31.970
and tutorials.

39
00:02:32.190 --> 00:02:40.230
But then we use this preprocess image class which is a class from Image pre-processing to pre-processed

40
00:02:40.290 --> 00:02:45.870
the images that will come into the new one that work and we preprocess them so that they have a square

41
00:02:45.870 --> 00:02:54.060
format with the dominations 80 by 80 and that remember is because in our new one that work well we set

42
00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.530
our input images to have the time engines one by 80 by 80.

43
00:02:58.560 --> 00:03:03.490
Remember one is the number of channels and so one means that we're working with black and white images.

44
00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:06.350
So that's the greyscale here.

45
00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:14.070
And 80 by 80 means that the dominance of our input images will be 80 by 80 and that is what we set in

46
00:03:14.070 --> 00:03:20.190
the neural network but of course then we need to specify this when putting the images which is exactly

47
00:03:20.190 --> 00:03:23.150
what we do here with this preprocess image class.

48
00:03:23.670 --> 00:03:29.610
And then after we import the environment with the right format of the input images while we import the

49
00:03:29.610 --> 00:03:34.920
whole game with the videos with this line of code and remember the cool thing about this is that in

50
00:03:34.920 --> 00:03:40.350
the end we'll see the videos are playing Doom So we will see how it will kill the monsters try to reach

51
00:03:40.350 --> 00:03:43.410
the best and everything will be super exciting.

52
00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:48.170
And remember that these videos will go into these videos folder.

53
00:03:48.630 --> 00:03:49.100
All right.

54
00:03:49.230 --> 00:03:54.990
And last line here but I want to show it to you because that's important that's now more related to

55
00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.710
the AI AI that we're building.

56
00:03:56.910 --> 00:04:02.680
Well remember that our neural network takes as input number actions.

57
00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:07.950
That's because you know we want to make an AI AI that we can test easily on several environments and

58
00:04:07.950 --> 00:04:09.660
several Dume environments.

59
00:04:09.660 --> 00:04:15.100
And since the different environments have different number of actions Well we specified this number

60
00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:19.070
actions variable as the input of the CNN the brain.

61
00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:26.250
And therefore now what we're going to do is get this number actions variable using the Dumah environment

62
00:04:26.250 --> 00:04:29.340
that we just important and created into this variable.

63
00:04:29.340 --> 00:04:34.860
And later this number actually is very well that we're about to create will be the input of the brain.

64
00:04:34.890 --> 00:04:36.000
So let's do this.

65
00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:42.690
I'm introducing this real now variable number actions number actions equals.

66
00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:47.870
Now we're going to take our doom environment that is the variable that we created.

67
00:04:48.150 --> 00:04:49.330
So do my.

68
00:04:49.500 --> 00:04:56.250
Then we add here that and then well here we go we take the first here action space that's the set of

69
00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:57.200
your actions.

70
00:04:57.230 --> 00:05:01.960
I encourage you to have a look at the opening at Horrible's to see how it works.

71
00:05:02.010 --> 00:05:05.530
You know to understand how to open the gym environments work.

72
00:05:05.670 --> 00:05:07.940
But basically this is the set of actions.

73
00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:14.070
And from this set of actions we can access the number of actions in the environment and to do this data

74
00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.770
here and then.

75
00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:25.050
And that's the number of actions and therefore doom and that action space will return 7 6:48 because

76
00:05:25.050 --> 00:05:26.550
there are seven actions.

77
00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.640
I know that we can see six actions in the two environments on the opening page but I think we can also

78
00:05:32.640 --> 00:05:33.400
run.

79
00:05:33.490 --> 00:05:39.000
And so you know we can move forward move left move right turn left turn right and shoot.

80
00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:45.090
And besides we can run that makes seven actions all right and that's it for getting to do environment

81
00:05:45.330 --> 00:05:47.010
we have to do our environment.

82
00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:52.640
We have a number of actions so we have so far everything that we need for our brain.

83
00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.320
We will then just create an object or brain object which we'll call CNN minimal letters.

84
00:05:58.500 --> 00:06:04.500
And since any function takes a number of actions as argument well we will put the number of actions

85
00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:11.160
in the scene an object that we will create and then of course we'll create the body and eventually the

86
00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:11.690
AI.

87
00:06:11.850 --> 00:06:18.090
And that's why the next section I'm going to call it building an AI AI because now we can build as many

88
00:06:18.090 --> 00:06:19.170
eyes as we want.

89
00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:22.070
That's the awesome thing about object oriented programming.

90
00:06:22.110 --> 00:06:24.290
We can build any AI's as we want.

91
00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:29.820
And so we're going to build our AI that has the sophisticated brain and that's exactly what we'll do

92
00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:31.690
in the next tutorial.

93
00:06:31.860 --> 00:06:33.430
Until then enjoy AI.
