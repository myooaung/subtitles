00:00:00,510 --> 00:00:03,060
Hello and welcome to this Python tutorial.

2
00:00:03,060 --> 00:00:04,690
All right so we just made the brain.

3
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:06,290
And now let's make the body.

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,640
So as you understood the body is the part where we define how the actions are going to be played like

5
00:00:11,640 --> 00:00:13,550
what happens for real human body.

6
00:00:13,620 --> 00:00:18,860
You know you have the brain that sends signals to the body and then your body plays the action.

7
00:00:19,030 --> 00:00:23,060
Well that's the same we have our signals coming from the brain.

8
00:00:23,130 --> 00:00:26,080
We get the output signal with the Ford function here.

9
00:00:26,190 --> 00:00:31,320
You know first what happens is that we get the images the images go into the eyes of the neural network

10
00:00:31,470 --> 00:00:37,050
composed of the three convolutional layers and then with the fully connected layers we get the output

11
00:00:37,050 --> 00:00:40,040
signal from the brain which contains the values.

12
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:45,690
But then this output signal should be forwarded to the body and the body will play the action.

13
00:00:45,690 --> 00:00:48,830
And so that's exactly the part that we're going to take right now.

14
00:00:48,880 --> 00:00:55,690
We're going to implement the way the body will play the action and the way it will do it is with a certain

15
00:00:55,690 --> 00:00:58,350
X method exactly like for the Southron car.

16
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:05,940
I insist that the max method is highly recommended for play in action with the body of the AI and therefore

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:07,750
that's the one we're going to go for.

18
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:13,620
But as opposed to the sort of income we're going to make in class and this class will of course correspond

19
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:21,140
to the body of the eye and therefore let's start by introducing a class here that we're going to call

20
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:30,240
soft next but like this I don't want to call it soft Max only because soughed Max is a class of Pi torch

21
00:01:30,480 --> 00:01:31,730
from the end module.

22
00:01:31,860 --> 00:01:33,270
So it's dangerous to call it this way.

23
00:01:33,270 --> 00:01:35,660
Therefore I'm calling it sucked Maxwellian.

24
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:43,560
Now it's very clear that our CNN convolutional neural network is the brain and Sephton activity is the

25
00:01:43,560 --> 00:01:44,960
body of the ear.

26
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:52,010
So Soft next body and let's inherit from the in that module.

27
00:01:52,050 --> 00:01:53,580
I don't think we're going to use it.

28
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:56,150
But anyway we can still inherit from it.

29
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:01,260
You know in case you want to improve this stuff maximally class and want to use some tools from the

30
00:02:01,480 --> 00:02:04,780
module Well you will be able to do it with the engine module.

31
00:02:04,780 --> 00:02:08,590
But at this point I don't think we will be using any of the in a module.

32
00:02:08,700 --> 00:02:13,130
So then in and let's go inside the body.

33
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:19,910
All right so first as usual we are going to start with our innate function to define the variables and

34
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:21,030
the future.

35
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:21,980
But.

36
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:29,040
That is the bodies of the AI AI and actually ask for a human body a parameter that can define it is

37
00:02:29,130 --> 00:02:29,950
the temperature.

38
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,530
And actually that's going to be the only temperature.

39
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,060
So it's a simple body but still using this temperature parameter will do a lot for us.

40
00:02:37,420 --> 00:02:44,510
OK but before the temperature let's not forget the self but the objects for the bodies and now we can

41
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,220
input the temperature see which is the same parameter as the one we use for this car.

42
00:02:50,960 --> 00:02:51,300
OK.

43
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:55,790
And then Cullen and let's define our variables.

44
00:02:55,950 --> 00:03:02,130
So since we inherit from DNA not Mudgal we're going to use the superfunction again.

45
00:03:02,190 --> 00:03:09,570
And so let's be efficient let's keep Yes and let's face it that's right here.

46
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:17,300
And of course let's not forget to replace CNN here by soughed next buddy.

47
00:03:17,430 --> 00:03:17,880
There you go.

48
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:22,420
Now I suppose that might become a reflex for you to use the superfunction at this stage.

49
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:30,660
And then what do we have to do is of course set are temperature variable with self that T and that will

50
00:03:30,660 --> 00:03:37,190
be equal to the argument that will be input when creating an object at the next very class.

51
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,810
I remind that whenever you create an object of the soft next class you have to put the arguments that

52
00:03:42,810 --> 00:03:49,080
are in the init function and therefore there is t and then the variable of your object attached to objects

53
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:54,620
self the team will be called to this T which is the argument that you will input.

54
00:03:54,700 --> 00:03:55,090
All right.

55
00:03:55,110 --> 00:03:58,560
And now that said for the function that's actually all we need.

56
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,110
So I guess we're ready to move onto the next function of the soughed maximally class.

57
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:09,040
And this is going to be the last function there are only two functions in any function.

58
00:04:09,070 --> 00:04:14,540
And the next one that will implement in the next toile which will be the forward function and Whiteford.

59
00:04:14,620 --> 00:04:18,920
That's because right now we have to forward the output signal from the brain.

60
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:24,700
That is you know the Cuno use content in the output neurons of the output layer to the body which will

61
00:04:24,700 --> 00:04:25,770
play the action.

62
00:04:25,810 --> 00:04:31,920
So we are forwarding the output signal from the brain to the body that will play the action move forward

63
00:04:32,020 --> 00:04:36,000
go left go right turn left turn right or shoot.

64
00:04:36,070 --> 00:04:40,220
All right so let's do that in the next to toile and then some Then I.
