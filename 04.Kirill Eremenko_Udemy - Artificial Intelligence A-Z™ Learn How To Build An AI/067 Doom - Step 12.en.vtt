00:00:00.420 --> 00:00:02.510
Hello and welcome to this tutorial.

2
00:00:02.670 --> 00:00:03.020
All right.

3
00:00:03.030 --> 00:00:09.020
Now time to build our very first AI because right now we've only made the manual of instructions with

4
00:00:09.030 --> 00:00:12.150
the class but we haven't created any object yet.

5
00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:17.550
And so we haven't a real actual AI yet but we are about to get it right now because we were able to

6
00:00:17.550 --> 00:00:24.640
create one object of this class and this object will be nothing else than a name which will have a brain.

7
00:00:24.650 --> 00:00:25.830
Anybody.

8
00:00:25.830 --> 00:00:27.080
All right so let's do this.

9
00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.570
It's actually very simple to do it now that we have defined everything with two classes.

10
00:00:32.580 --> 00:00:38.880
So basically what we need to do is first create a brain because as you can see when we create any AI

11
00:00:38.910 --> 00:00:44.180
we need to input a brain but we also inputs our bodies we need to create a body as well.

12
00:00:44.310 --> 00:00:50.680
And then once we created a brain object in a body object Well we will be able to create the AI.

13
00:00:50.940 --> 00:00:55.170
But no worries we will build the brain and the body and the flashlight and actually just do it right

14
00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:55.710
now.

15
00:00:55.860 --> 00:00:57.230
Let's start with the brain.

16
00:00:57.240 --> 00:01:02.730
We're going to call the brain CNN because the brain is a convolutional neural network and it will be

17
00:01:02.730 --> 00:01:05.590
an object of the same class.

18
00:01:05.730 --> 00:01:07.720
So it makes sense to call CNN.

19
00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:15.000
CNN equals and then we take our CNN class Stein and we put in parenthesis according to you.

20
00:01:15.150 --> 00:01:19.060
Well at this point right now when creates an object of a class.

21
00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:24.240
What we have to put is very simply the argument of the function.

22
00:01:24.390 --> 00:01:29.850
And that's number actions and things to what we had previously when getting an environment where we

23
00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:36.960
already have this number actions and therefore we simply need to input number actions here into the

24
00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:38.090
CNN class.

25
00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:38.850
Perfect.

26
00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.260
So now we have the brain.

27
00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:46.140
Now let's make the body we're going to create an object at the next point class and we're going to call

28
00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:51.260
this object soughed next version that will be the value of our AI.

29
00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:58.710
And this object is an object of the soughed next buddy class to which we have two inputs.

30
00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.960
The only argument of the innate function of the soft next class which is the temperature T and therefore

31
00:02:05.170 --> 00:02:11.870
input t that we have to specify value because so far t is just an argument to T equals.

32
00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:18.240
And we're going to start with one that's a small temperature but this might work very well and actually

33
00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:24.210
I already know this will work very well so that you can try with other temperatures you know how it

34
00:02:24.210 --> 00:02:24.700
works now.

35
00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:27.770
Your actions will be more sure of themselves.

36
00:02:27.910 --> 00:02:32.790
There's action with the high school that you will have a higher probability to be selected as opposed

37
00:02:32.790 --> 00:02:37.350
to the other actions which will have lower probabilities to be selected and therefore there will be

38
00:02:37.350 --> 00:02:38.320
less explored.

39
00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:40.600
But anyway we can start with one.

40
00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.720
This will get us a good.

41
00:02:43.950 --> 00:02:46.130
All right so now we have a brain.

42
00:02:46.130 --> 00:02:47.260
We have a body.

43
00:02:47.330 --> 00:02:50.660
So I guess it's time to make the final eventually.

44
00:02:50.870 --> 00:02:54.760
So now you're going to see how things are going to become so simple.

45
00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:58.150
It's when the intuition reaches its speech to make an AI.

46
00:02:58.220 --> 00:03:04.020
We simply need to create a new object that we call of course AI from our AI class.

47
00:03:04.130 --> 00:03:10.490
And since the eye is composed of a brain and a body we input the brain which is our convolutional neural

48
00:03:10.490 --> 00:03:11.290
network.

49
00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:21.110
The object and a body which is nothing else than the soft Mak's body object from the south very fast

50
00:03:21.470 --> 00:03:27.620
and see we build an AI in a flashlight by just putting a brain in the body.

51
00:03:27.620 --> 00:03:30.470
And now we have any ready to be trained.

52
00:03:30.630 --> 00:03:36.110
So now it's time to launch the whole deep convolutional learning process with experience we play that

53
00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:43.040
bonus eligibility trace on 10 steps and eventually once we have all this we will train the AI to make

54
00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:43.710
it smart.

55
00:03:44.030 --> 00:03:45.950
So can try to do this.

56
00:03:46.070 --> 00:03:49.530
The next section is going to be about setting up experience replay.

57
00:03:49.670 --> 00:03:54.680
So we're not going to implement it all over again like for the self-driving car because the good news

58
00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:56.810
is that we already have it in print.

59
00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:02.450
So that will be fast we'll just create an object of the replay memory class that is in this experience

60
00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.400
replay file.

61
00:04:03.490 --> 00:04:08.770
So that will help us a lot and therefore we will move on quickly to its new and most important that

62
00:04:08.780 --> 00:04:09.980
is the train.

63
00:04:10.010 --> 00:04:12.130
So let's take this in the next tutorials.

64
00:04:12.170 --> 00:04:13.660
And until then I.
