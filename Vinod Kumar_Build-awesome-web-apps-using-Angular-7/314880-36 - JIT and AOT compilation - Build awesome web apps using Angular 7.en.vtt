00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
since we're developing angular application using typescript by No,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.870
you should be aware that angular uses a compiler to transform over types.

00:00:08.870 --> 00:00:12.430
Get called into a job as good former that closes can understand.

00:00:12.430 --> 00:00:14.740
Angular comes with two types of compilers.

00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:17.950
One is called JT are just in 10 compiler.

00:00:17.950 --> 00:00:21.100
The other one is a body are ahead of time.

00:00:21.100 --> 00:00:21.780
Combine ER,

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:25.480
the default development build uses a jit compiler.

00:00:25.480 --> 00:00:29.410
So when we run NJ Star Command by default,

00:00:29.410 --> 00:00:30.110
development,

00:00:30.110 --> 00:00:31.260
build is generated.

00:00:31.260 --> 00:00:35.330
And hence the Jit compiler is used to understand the same.

00:00:35.330 --> 00:00:38.050
Let's go and build our application.

00:00:38.050 --> 00:00:40.120
He was in the commercial in Djibouti,

00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:44.250
which by before uses the development build options.

00:00:44.250 --> 00:00:46.050
So when I pressed Enter,

00:00:46.050 --> 00:00:50.790
it has generated the required chalice Could finds.

00:00:50.790 --> 00:00:53.970
One of the file here is the Rendered RJ's,

00:00:53.970 --> 00:00:57.890
which comprises off angular compiler and angular framework.

00:00:57.890 --> 00:01:01.370
We also see a map fine for each of the JavaScript.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:07.910
This can be used for exploring the content off a particular JavaScript and its dependencies

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:07.910
.

00:01:07.910 --> 00:01:08.590
For this,

00:01:08.590 --> 00:01:11.210
we need to install a tool Caldas source.

00:01:11.210 --> 00:01:14.870
Map Explorer and let's install the same NPM.

00:01:14.870 --> 00:01:17.950
I source my explorer.

00:01:17.950 --> 00:01:26.500
Now we have a command call source map Explorer in the North Modules slash Dark bin folder

00:01:26.500 --> 00:01:33.030
to explore the rendered RJ's Let's type in the command dark slash north modules dot being

00:01:33.030 --> 00:01:36.120
slash source Map Explorer,

00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.700
followed by the vendor charges,

00:01:38.700 --> 00:01:43.410
which is there in the disc folder Phonebook at Render Chase.

00:01:43.410 --> 00:01:44.870
So I press send us.

00:01:44.870 --> 00:01:48.380
This opens a joy in the browser,

00:01:48.380 --> 00:01:54.940
exploring various aspects off rendered IGs you can see the daughter says that the render

00:01:54.940 --> 00:01:57.050
chases 3.8 nb,

00:01:57.050 --> 00:02:03.410
or average more than 50% off that is occupied by the angular framework and the angular

00:02:03.410 --> 00:02:04.050
compiler.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:06.390
So if we use this build,

00:02:06.390 --> 00:02:08.570
fight and run the application,

00:02:08.570 --> 00:02:10.790
every diamond component has to be loaded.

00:02:10.790 --> 00:02:12.480
The compiler comes into picture,

00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:17.400
complains that India JavaScript for the first time and then serves to the Broza.

00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.050
Subsequent requirements will use the generated Charles get files.

00:02:21.050 --> 00:02:26.710
Now we can explore what happens when you're using the production boot by stopping this

00:02:26.710 --> 00:02:33.310
application and rebuilding our application using the dash dash broad option.

00:02:33.310 --> 00:02:36.750
So I can say Engy Build Broad,

00:02:36.750 --> 00:02:39.250
which includes the A woody compiler.

00:02:39.250 --> 00:02:44.080
There are two things you can observe.

00:02:44.080 --> 00:02:48.230
Number one is that there is no map files generated,

00:02:48.230 --> 00:02:51.330
along with the JavaScript fights and that is simple.

00:02:51.330 --> 00:02:54.290
We can add another flak or dashed our source map.

00:02:54.290 --> 00:02:55.950
But importantly,

00:02:55.950 --> 00:02:58.290
there is no rendered RJ's itself.

00:02:58.290 --> 00:02:59.360
And this is family,

00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:04.610
because the major part of the vendor chase was the framework in the compiler itself,

00:03:04.610 --> 00:03:06.800
which are not there anymore on.

00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:14.550
So it is combined with the main churches it's in so we can explore main dot Js on.

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:19.440
We can also generate the window torches explicitly by adding another flight.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:22.380
So let's issue the command N g will.

00:03:22.380 --> 00:03:24.210
That's just problem.

00:03:24.210 --> 00:03:25.490
Dash dash.

00:03:25.490 --> 00:03:26.280
So smart.

00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:36.650
And that's just when the chunk no other Window GS,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:44.350
which is only 349 kilobytes in comparison with 3.8 nb off the previous portion.

00:03:44.350 --> 00:03:50.220
So let's explore the same day Dark slash nor modules,

00:03:50.220 --> 00:03:51.880
dark slash source.

00:03:51.880 --> 00:04:00.600
My explorer door slash list slash phonebook ab slash friend order Js And now you can see

00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.950
that there is no compiler as well as the angular frame were included in this one.

00:04:05.950 --> 00:04:12.070
This was the previous one which occupied 3.8 and be more than 50% is the framework in the

00:04:12.070 --> 00:04:14.730
compiler and there is no compiler here,

00:04:14.730 --> 00:04:20.660
which means that all our typescript court gets converted into JavaScript during the build

00:04:20.660 --> 00:04:21.850
process itself.

00:04:21.850 --> 00:04:24.230
So if there is any errors,

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.220
such as template binding errors,

00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:28.710
they will be reported during the build itself.

00:04:28.710 --> 00:04:31.650
But as in the development Washington,

00:04:31.650 --> 00:04:34.400
the compilation happens Darren time.

00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:37.280
So unless there is an editor during time,

00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:38.860
it will not be reported at all.

00:04:38.860 --> 00:04:45.540
Let's understand the same by committing a template boiling error explicitly and see if the

00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.950
other is reported at the wrong time or the builder time.

00:04:48.950 --> 00:04:51.050
So I go to the core.

00:04:51.050 --> 00:04:53.450
I go to one of the component.

00:04:53.450 --> 00:04:58.360
Let's go to the other contact component in the DIA's.

00:04:58.360 --> 00:05:00.590
That's clear one function called us.

00:05:00.590 --> 00:05:11.840
Get detective exactly returns a string on a new contact and let us call this function in

00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:20.040
our HTML by using a double live like it get titled on just to make sure that we have a

00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.320
template planning other,

00:05:21.320 --> 00:05:27.250
let's deliberately give get Underscore title as a function called Save This.

00:05:27.250 --> 00:05:29.240
Let's go back to the command prompt.

00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:33.150
Stop the source map Explorer and use the command in the soul,

00:05:33.150 --> 00:05:36.330
which by default uses the development bill.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.180
When I pressed enter,

00:05:38.180 --> 00:05:40.490
you can see that there was no other and it said,

00:05:40.490 --> 00:05:41.940
compiled successfully.

00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:44.490
He won the other template binding together.

00:05:44.490 --> 00:05:46.450
So let's go to the browser.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:47.440
Andi,

00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:54.450
open local host 47 0 and you can see that the application is running successfully.

00:05:54.450 --> 00:05:57.670
I should be ableto goto other components,

00:05:57.670 --> 00:06:00.250
but when I goto our a new contact,

00:06:00.250 --> 00:06:06.550
you will see that there is no title and this is primarily because now that the art contact

00:06:06.550 --> 00:06:07.800
component is loaded,

00:06:07.800 --> 00:06:11.300
the Jit compiler attempts to compile that faces,

00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.890
a template binding better.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:18.370
And that other is reported on the console saying Get underscore Title is not a function,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:20.760
so there is no error during the building process,

00:06:20.760 --> 00:06:22.850
but at the same time we do have an error.

00:06:22.850 --> 00:06:26.950
Now let's have a look at what happens with a woody option.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:27.870
So let me close.

00:06:27.870 --> 00:06:30.670
This time I go back to the command.

00:06:30.670 --> 00:06:32.850
Prompt trust controls he to stop this,

00:06:32.850 --> 00:06:39.990
clear the scream type the Command Engy served with a flag off a body which is included.

00:06:39.990 --> 00:06:44.550
If you're doing Engy build dashes product and that's ender,

00:06:44.550 --> 00:06:50.040
you should see that there isn't better indicating a template binding better,

00:06:50.040 --> 00:06:56.310
and you can see that the bill is failed and I cannot open a new attack,

00:06:56.310 --> 00:07:01.810
local first for a double zero because the complete buildings failed at this point in time,

00:07:01.810 --> 00:07:05.150
and just to make sure that this is successfully done.

00:07:05.150 --> 00:07:06.260
If there is no edit,

00:07:06.260 --> 00:07:07.320
save this.

00:07:07.320 --> 00:07:09.230
Go back toe the command.

00:07:09.230 --> 00:07:10.340
Prompt control,

00:07:10.340 --> 00:07:12.950
See to stop this are worth on the same come.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:17.310
And what's more this time we do not have any kind of combat elation,

00:07:17.310 --> 00:07:24.090
others because of which our buildings successful on the application can be open without any

00:07:24.090 --> 00:07:25.150
problem as well.
