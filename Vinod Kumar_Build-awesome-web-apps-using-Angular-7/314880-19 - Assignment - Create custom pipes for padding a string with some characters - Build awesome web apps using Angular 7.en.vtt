00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.180
So here is that I meant I have open local hose for two,

00:00:03.180 --> 00:00:05.400
double zero and the page looks something like this.

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.890
And that's because the html here.

00:00:07.890 --> 00:00:10.950
So it says that the hitch one under the age of nothing else.

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:18.440
I have created two pipes here l pad dark pipe tortillas and are bad about 5 30 years.

00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:18.910
So,

00:00:18.910 --> 00:00:19.130
really,

00:00:19.130 --> 00:00:21.460
use that in our HTML.

00:00:21.460 --> 00:00:21.950
Here.

00:00:21.950 --> 00:00:33.700
I'm gonna take a paragraph and then I'll take a name like we not Andi as another same this

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:33.700
.

00:00:33.700 --> 00:00:41.220
You'll see that there is a left side Partridge string here and by default it allotted five

00:00:41.220 --> 00:00:42.150
as tricks.

00:00:42.150 --> 00:00:46.130
It is another example in the abduct component.

00:00:46.130 --> 00:00:48.260
30 years have defined a variable multi,

00:00:48.260 --> 00:00:50.260
which has been a cento.

00:00:50.260 --> 00:00:53.960
The texture we know so I can come down here and I can use the same thing.

00:00:53.960 --> 00:00:59.550
I can tell me by anybody and then I can specify 25.

00:00:59.550 --> 00:01:02.110
That means they're totally written off.

00:01:02.110 --> 00:01:06.070
The whole put string is gonna be 25 out of which whatever the name occupies,

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:08.150
stats could be on the right side,

00:01:08.150 --> 00:01:13.470
but the left tail of which will be battered using a character off my choice for example,

00:01:13.470 --> 00:01:14.560
if you put a dollar here,

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.020
so that's the second perimeter for the help.

00:01:18.020 --> 00:01:22.100
So which means after parting dollars total,

00:01:22.100 --> 00:01:25.700
it would be 25 characters or average name,

00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:28.600
which is Currently we know that price fight characters on the right side.

00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.460
The left child will be partnered with the dollar symbol for the remaining number of

00:01:32.460 --> 00:01:33.810
characters signed.

00:01:33.810 --> 00:01:34.510
Save this.

00:01:34.510 --> 00:01:38.300
You should see $20 symbols followed by the world.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:38.630
You know,

00:01:38.630 --> 00:01:40.560
Nike ways.

00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:42.310
You can also use our fire.

00:01:42.310 --> 00:01:51.830
Some unclear and other examples aren't say name are 25 probably a hash on close the

00:01:51.830 --> 00:01:52.450
brackets.

00:01:52.450 --> 00:01:53.270
Save it,

00:01:53.270 --> 00:01:55.940
and I should see the fighting happens on the right side.

00:01:55.940 --> 00:01:56.450
This time,

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:58.730
we can also combine both.

00:01:58.730 --> 00:02:00.250
Any parent are back together.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.800
Stay Here is another example.

00:02:01.800 --> 00:02:10.850
Let's give the name I did on the left side for 10 characters with as tricks.

00:02:10.850 --> 00:02:12.330
And if you don't mention anything,

00:02:12.330 --> 00:02:15.490
it's gonna be a strict by default for one day.

00:02:15.490 --> 00:02:19.040
I colon 15 save it,

00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:25.050
and I should see the total where it would be 15 on the name we know exactly lies in between

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:25.050
.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:30.890
So this is the assignment I think you would be requiring around 30 minute for this on the

00:02:30.890 --> 00:02:31.350
best
