WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.380
Now that we have got all these basic set up required,

00:00:04.380 --> 00:00:08.350
let's get started by creating a new angular application.

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:11.130
Now this is where you have to decide.

00:00:11.130 --> 00:00:13.130
We want to create our applications.

00:00:13.130 --> 00:00:19.510
I would like to create my application on my desktop and let's say I want to create a new

00:00:19.510 --> 00:00:20.150
project.

00:00:20.150 --> 00:00:22.660
Angular projects are created is in N.

00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:22.980
G.

00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:25.040
So let's have a look it energy desk trash,

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.010
health toe.

00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:28.260
Identify one of the various options we have.

00:00:28.260 --> 00:00:33.850
And it is that list available commands on their sharp descriptions,

00:00:33.850 --> 00:00:35.810
and you can take N G help,

00:00:35.810 --> 00:00:44.230
followed by options Now in G nu is option so I can say engine you help and then that's

00:00:44.230 --> 00:00:46.650
gonna give me help on the new option.

00:00:46.650 --> 00:00:47.900
As you can see there,

00:00:47.900 --> 00:00:49.770
is there plenty of options that we have.

00:00:49.770 --> 00:00:54.430
But the only thing that we have to do is the 1st 1 is the name that we had to give,

00:00:54.430 --> 00:00:57.050
which is the name of the new workspace.

00:00:57.050 --> 00:00:57.610
Basically,

00:00:57.610 --> 00:00:58.840
it's gonna create a folder,

00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.760
which is your product.

00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:03.540
Folder also makes that as your project by name as well,

00:01:03.540 --> 00:01:05.590
and there are few other options.

00:01:05.590 --> 00:01:06.420
I don't think so.

00:01:06.420 --> 00:01:07.890
Any of these options are recorded.

00:01:07.890 --> 00:01:08.770
Despondent time.

00:01:08.770 --> 00:01:11.750
Let's just go ahead and explore that.

00:01:11.750 --> 00:01:21.480
So take your Benji new on Let's say for a jumper first we can change the name it then you

00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:22.750
want in the future.

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:26.400
So this is gonna do ask you few questions.

00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:27.650
Just couple of them.

00:01:27.650 --> 00:01:28.220
Number one,

00:01:28.220 --> 00:01:28.740
it asked.

00:01:28.740 --> 00:01:29.460
What do you want?

00:01:29.460 --> 00:01:31.190
A rounding eso?

00:01:31.190 --> 00:01:31.590
No.

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:37.940
Now routing is the one that wrote in basically the routing model that enables angular

00:01:37.940 --> 00:01:42.210
applications to be single braid applications and the whole purpose off.

00:01:42.210 --> 00:01:46.140
Angular Web applications are to create single place applications.

00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:52.920
Single bit applications basically means that you have one single HTML finds on the lots and

00:01:52.920 --> 00:01:57.360
lots off partial files that will be there on the browser lords.

00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.360
Only one html file on everything else is loaded.

00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:06.750
A synchronously making application look very rich in experience.

00:02:06.750 --> 00:02:09.780
The user experience will be very nice on.

00:02:09.780 --> 00:02:13.730
There are lots and lots of examples today in the world that you can have a look It,

00:02:13.730 --> 00:02:14.900
including Gmail,

00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.450
Facebook and couple of others.

00:02:16.450 --> 00:02:19.560
We would be doing this in our project,

00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:21.550
so a despite in time,

00:02:21.550 --> 00:02:23.740
we don't want angular toe interfere,

00:02:23.740 --> 00:02:27.310
but we would be manually configuring on this routing information.

00:02:27.310 --> 00:02:28.800
So I'm gonna simply say no,

00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:30.650
I don't want this floating to be added.

00:02:30.650 --> 00:02:34.060
The second question is about it's time sheet on.

00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:37.900
I'm going to be using bootstrap for this particular project,

00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:44.800
which is a which is one of the most popular you can say the in CSS framework.

00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:46.530
It's created by Twitter.

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:49.240
Andi on It's really cool.

00:02:49.240 --> 00:02:53.410
So we're gonna use that on just going to leave it at CSS Chris Ender,

00:02:53.410 --> 00:02:55.550
and then it's gonna create the project.

00:02:55.550 --> 00:02:59.560
Scaffolding also all sorts of finds its creating.

00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.780
Sometimes this might look a little intimidating,

00:03:02.780 --> 00:03:04.260
but we're going to look in tow.

00:03:04.260 --> 00:03:08.690
Most off this as what they're in our project on.

00:03:08.690 --> 00:03:12.280
It also runs what the NPM install.

00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.640
What it does is it would have created a file called Package Dodgers.

00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:16.250
And as you can see,

00:03:16.250 --> 00:03:17.920
the package doctors and is here,

00:03:17.920 --> 00:03:19.000
the package start.

00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:23.660
Jason is the place where you have all that dependence is listed,

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:24.950
and it's insulting.

00:03:24.950 --> 00:03:33.060
All the dependent is currently now this dependence is include something like a transfer

00:03:33.060 --> 00:03:36.920
election from job typescript to JavaScript are building off.

00:03:36.920 --> 00:03:44.820
CS is there is a There's an Rx jays which is used for asynchronous Http calls,

00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:48.070
and there are plenty of them that are in stock now.

00:03:48.070 --> 00:03:50.030
Additional dependence is like bootstrap.

00:03:50.030 --> 00:03:50.670
For example,

00:03:50.670 --> 00:03:56.450
we might have to install ourselves if you want to include our combined J query along with

00:03:56.450 --> 00:03:57.080
the angular.

00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.870
You can do that as well here and now that it has done,

00:04:00.870 --> 00:04:05.140
we can open off a Civil war that I'm still in my desktop.

00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:10.030
I have to get into the folder called as first on the Theory.

00:04:10.030 --> 00:04:10.540
First,

00:04:10.540 --> 00:04:13.960
I feel using visuals to the accord.

00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:20.520
You should be able to say Poor taught toe open this particular folder in your editor.

00:04:20.520 --> 00:04:21.460
If not,

00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:29.980
you can always open visual Studio Court and and then you can say I want to open that

00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.240
particular file.

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.580
So I have had open folder option here.

00:04:34.580 --> 00:04:35.750
Click on that.

00:04:35.750 --> 00:04:38.360
I go to my desktop on desktop.

00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:43.690
I had this first time say Open now.

00:04:43.690 --> 00:04:47.450
Here we can have a look at all other finds that are generated.

00:04:47.450 --> 00:04:52.430
Since our angular application is created using typescript,

00:04:52.430 --> 00:04:55.050
which is a super set off JavaScript,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:57.300
it has few options here.

00:04:57.300 --> 00:04:58.960
Elect es lint touches,

00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:04.200
and this is basically about the rules on and regulations to be followed.

00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.800
When you're working with the typescript on you can enable visible few options from this

00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:09.580
particular Jason.

00:05:09.580 --> 00:05:11.950
Find some some of the basic rules,

00:05:11.950 --> 00:05:12.970
the obvious conflict.

00:05:12.970 --> 00:05:18.780
Jason basically has some information such as Where do you think the output file should be

00:05:18.780 --> 00:05:19.310
created?

00:05:19.310 --> 00:05:20.970
But that's so smart Should be used.

00:05:20.970 --> 00:05:25.230
What is the What is the target to be use?

00:05:25.230 --> 00:05:29.530
That means if you're compiling your typescript finds into JavaScript.

00:05:29.530 --> 00:05:31.320
What is the washing off?

00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:36.880
A transcript standards that you want to follow so that older roses get support from here

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.480
and so on.

00:05:37.480 --> 00:05:39.660
Unless very quiet,

00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:43.360
We don't need to come back here at all so we can close this off course.

00:05:43.360 --> 00:05:47.390
They read me dot MD which actually get if you're publishing this in tow,

00:05:47.390 --> 00:05:48.080
get tub.

00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:51.700
You would be able to read all the North's about this particular project.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:53.030
You can totally ignore that.

00:05:53.030 --> 00:05:54.690
They're the package start,

00:05:54.690 --> 00:05:55.460
Jason,

00:05:55.460 --> 00:05:59.090
which is one of the most important finds that you might want to be,

00:05:59.090 --> 00:06:00.090
uh,

00:06:00.090 --> 00:06:01.050
looking in tow.

00:06:01.050 --> 00:06:05.230
And that has got some dependencies on the development.

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:08.310
Dependencies and development dependencies in person.

00:06:08.310 --> 00:06:14.150
Something like framework like Jasmine's are carmine and typescript.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:14.960
and stuff like that.

00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:16.820
So which is only required during development.

00:06:16.820 --> 00:06:20.550
But these are gonna be bundled into your build fires as well.

00:06:20.550 --> 00:06:24.140
These are required on their a few shortcut commands here.

00:06:24.140 --> 00:06:25.690
So when I n g,

00:06:25.690 --> 00:06:27.580
this is the command that's gonna be used.

00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:31.250
The N G command is part of the North Modules.

00:06:31.250 --> 00:06:33.180
Andi there little dark bin directory.

00:06:33.180 --> 00:06:37.270
And as you can see that inside that you'll have an N g on Windows,

00:06:37.270 --> 00:06:38.080
you'll have injury.

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:38.330
Doubts.

00:06:38.330 --> 00:06:40.850
CMD So that's what it's gonna execute.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.300
Even though we have installed globally,

00:06:43.300 --> 00:06:47.650
it will pick the one that is available locally whenever we're under command.

00:06:47.650 --> 00:06:49.350
And that's what is ng's here.

00:06:49.350 --> 00:06:53.960
So this is where you can come back and rename your project.

00:06:53.960 --> 00:06:58.700
If you feel like if you're publishing this project into some public repositories,

00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:03.370
this is where you might want to change the name on abortions if you want.

00:07:03.370 --> 00:07:08.050
So this is the thing is the angular Jason.

00:07:08.050 --> 00:07:09.960
This is an important file.

00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:12.330
We would be coming here in a bed toe,

00:07:12.330 --> 00:07:16.900
understand what's going on are what are the basic set up that we might want to change.

00:07:16.900 --> 00:07:17.880
So here,

00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:18.550
for example,

00:07:18.550 --> 00:07:21.800
it says that what other build options,

00:07:21.800 --> 00:07:22.050
you know.

00:07:22.050 --> 00:07:26.780
So something like which is your initial HTML which is that?

00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:33.770
SRC slash index HTM unzip goto SRC You'll see that there is an index html I insert off this

00:07:33.770 --> 00:07:35.390
HTML if you want to so say,

00:07:35.390 --> 00:07:40.840
for example Holmdel html you can you can come back and change that you were here Then there

00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:47.140
is also the main which says that which is the main file that your angular seal I should

00:07:47.140 --> 00:07:49.370
start looking into now.

00:07:49.370 --> 00:07:51.590
What happens is that behind the thin,

00:07:51.590 --> 00:07:57.620
angular CLI USA's back which is a model bundler So which means the only find that it's

00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:59.950
going to look into is this main doctor Yes,

00:07:59.950 --> 00:08:06.980
which is right here under SRC we have a main dirty s and then it starts looking into this

00:08:06.980 --> 00:08:08.110
file on.

00:08:08.110 --> 00:08:10.930
Then it goes into this particular angler core.

00:08:10.930 --> 00:08:12.790
I think I can do a control click.

00:08:12.790 --> 00:08:13.070
No.

00:08:13.070 --> 00:08:14.480
So if you look at this,

00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:18.190
if you look at this note modules at angular,

00:08:18.190 --> 00:08:26.020
there is a core on that has an indexed or did RTs essentially that's gonna be indexed R J s

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:26.020
.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:30.090
Now it's gonna go into this file and then it's going toe open this one.

00:08:30.090 --> 00:08:30.490
So,

00:08:30.490 --> 00:08:31.150
like this.

00:08:31.150 --> 00:08:33.480
It starts from the main 30 years on,

00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:39.320
then goes into the entire tree structure and loads all the friends that are that are they

00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:45.350
in your application and then then wonders that into one single file or a bunch of files.

00:08:45.350 --> 00:08:46.520
Actually,

00:08:46.520 --> 00:08:46.840
it has.

00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:49.760
So there's a main find that the pollen feels five upon.

00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.790
If it's are basically our files that are required for supporting the older brother,

00:08:55.790 --> 00:09:01.130
especially the Internet Explorer you have won five here called Hollifield start two years.

00:09:01.130 --> 00:09:02.530
You can see that that's here,

00:09:02.530 --> 00:09:05.170
and lots of things have been committed over here,

00:09:05.170 --> 00:09:07.210
and you can see that very clearly.

00:09:07.210 --> 00:09:12.350
I 9 10 11 and Crume less than 55 request all these politics.

00:09:12.350 --> 00:09:14.020
All we have to do abuse toe.

00:09:14.020 --> 00:09:16.810
Select this and then breast gun control.

00:09:16.810 --> 00:09:21.610
Slash on Windows and command Slash on Mac and that sketch un commended.

00:09:21.610 --> 00:09:22.330
And now,

00:09:22.330 --> 00:09:24.490
if you save it and when you're on your application,

00:09:24.490 --> 00:09:30.290
you will see that even your application runs in our Internet Explorer or 1911 as well as

00:09:30.290 --> 00:09:32.440
the older wash in less than 55.

00:09:32.440 --> 00:09:36.810
And then there are a few instructions there all self explanatory,

00:09:36.810 --> 00:09:38.760
so we don't have to worry about this.

00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:39.480
I'm gonna just say,

00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:42.390
undo and exit from this particular fight.

00:09:42.390 --> 00:09:44.850
So So,

00:09:44.850 --> 00:09:45.430
basically,

00:09:45.430 --> 00:09:50.550
you have all these files that are that can be managed in your application.

00:09:50.550 --> 00:09:52.170
A few other things.

00:09:52.170 --> 00:09:52.890
For example,

00:09:52.890 --> 00:09:55.940
assets that means anything in your sex.

00:09:55.940 --> 00:09:57.600
Generally the Assets folder.

00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:01.140
Convince imagers on generally images.

00:10:01.140 --> 00:10:05.770
Icons are You may have some videos and so on so they would be kept over here.

00:10:05.770 --> 00:10:06.890
So in right now,

00:10:06.890 --> 00:10:07.420
in a sex,

00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:09.540
you can see that there is nothing at this point in time.

00:10:09.540 --> 00:10:12.350
But in Calif your files.

00:10:12.350 --> 00:10:15.700
If your project requests and cannot bear static images,

00:10:15.700 --> 00:10:18.730
it's a good idea to keep that in that sense fuller.

00:10:18.730 --> 00:10:22.430
And refer to that your HD emails wherever that is required.

00:10:22.430 --> 00:10:25.060
It also has a reference off strikes.

00:10:25.060 --> 00:10:29.050
This is where we will come back and add another entry for or bootstrap.

00:10:29.050 --> 00:10:31.670
And in case if you have 1/3 party scripts,

00:10:31.670 --> 00:10:33.540
you can specify that you're as well.

00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:35.930
It's an area off all the scripts that you require,

00:10:35.930 --> 00:10:38.810
and they will be bundled into your application dining.

00:10:38.810 --> 00:10:43.310
It also has other options to,

00:10:43.310 --> 00:10:44.040
for example,

00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:50.120
toe internationalisation which is another topic which we will cover in Dept.

00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:50.550
Later.

00:10:50.550 --> 00:10:59.730
Let's close this and if you go to the SRC main dot es It says here some basic stuff but

00:10:59.730 --> 00:11:00.420
don't worry about this.

00:11:00.420 --> 00:11:02.130
Will come back and look into this main doctor.

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:02.520
Yes,

00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.350
indeed.

00:11:03.350 --> 00:11:03.660
A.

00:11:03.660 --> 00:11:07.180
But as far as our application extension,

00:11:07.180 --> 00:11:11.800
the files that matters is the index storage TML again regionally.

00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:17.700
Don't come in it that you're but you can come back and add some CSS which are not

00:11:17.700 --> 00:11:18.440
accessible.

00:11:18.440 --> 00:11:20.620
Why are the north are NPM?

00:11:20.620 --> 00:11:22.340
You can add it directly over here,

00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:24.480
which is generally not a good idea.

00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:27.530
But we will do that in case if required thistles.

00:11:27.530 --> 00:11:30.540
The only part of the is the only content in HTML.

00:11:30.540 --> 00:11:32.270
You don't have to add anything else now,

00:11:32.270 --> 00:11:34.430
surprisingly are strangely.

00:11:34.430 --> 00:11:37.570
You can see that there is something called a fruit slash fruit,

00:11:37.570 --> 00:11:40.890
which is which is not an HTM of that,

00:11:40.890 --> 00:11:42.730
but it looks like HTML now,

00:11:42.730 --> 00:11:43.310
basically,

00:11:43.310 --> 00:11:43.860
this is,

00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:45.510
uh ideally,

00:11:45.510 --> 00:11:48.860
this is supposed to be something like a door dash up dash route.

00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:52.950
But then browsers don't complain about the times that are not known.

00:11:52.950 --> 00:11:56.660
Now what actually happens is that when you run.

00:11:56.660 --> 00:11:57.110
Why,

00:11:57.110 --> 00:11:57.680
when Iran,

00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.360
Your angular project,

00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:02.620
there'll be additional script files injected over here.

00:12:02.620 --> 00:12:03.730
You will see that in a minute.

00:12:03.730 --> 00:12:07.250
Those include angular framework.

00:12:07.250 --> 00:12:08.020
Then,

00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:11.760
when the angular framework is loaded into the Charleston opium,

00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:17.650
it will scan once again for all these tags and look for this particular type on,

00:12:17.650 --> 00:12:23.190
then starts injecting components here now where the components the components that are

00:12:23.190 --> 00:12:25.850
created are generally kept in the Abdullah tree.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:26.760
It's a convention.

00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:27.480
We can always say,

00:12:27.480 --> 00:12:27.760
No,

00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:28.740
it's not gonna be nap.

00:12:28.740 --> 00:12:29.950
It's going to be somewhere else,

00:12:29.950 --> 00:12:33.360
but that is considered us your project folder.

00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.750
So everything that we're gonna cord is inside this app.

00:12:37.750 --> 00:12:38.460
And,

00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:41.470
as you can see that there are few fights already created for us.

00:12:41.470 --> 00:12:44.700
The 1st 1 is the at model TS.

00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:48.540
Now angular is all about modular ization.

00:12:48.540 --> 00:12:51.170
It says that you call a lot of things so,

00:12:51.170 --> 00:12:52.910
but you group them in modules.

00:12:52.910 --> 00:12:55.630
There's one model that is created on,

00:12:55.630 --> 00:13:03.150
but this model is car engine model it It's certain as engine module on its called at that

00:13:03.150 --> 00:13:03.520
model.

00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.390
At this point,

00:13:04.390 --> 00:13:06.350
we can always rename this if you want,

00:13:06.350 --> 00:13:09.460
but that has a bunch of references here.

00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:10.050
For example,

00:13:10.050 --> 00:13:15.160
this declaration block consists off on the components that we create here on Google.

00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.750
Spend a lot of time on this one,

00:13:16.750 --> 00:13:20.980
and then there is other model that my models may depend on,

00:13:20.980 --> 00:13:21.980
which is,

00:13:21.980 --> 00:13:22.180
like,

00:13:22.180 --> 00:13:22.610
in this case,

00:13:22.610 --> 00:13:23.700
it is browser market.

00:13:23.700 --> 00:13:29.400
So the present model basically is about about providing the browser are down manipulation,

00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:29.960
You can say,

00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:35.160
because we don't do any single done manipulation unless you want to indicate g query and

00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:35.850
stuff like that.

00:13:35.850 --> 00:13:39.040
But otherwise we won't be using any in Don manipulation.

00:13:39.040 --> 00:13:40.190
So that's about here.

00:13:40.190 --> 00:13:43.980
So imports were gonna refer toa some external models.

00:13:43.980 --> 00:13:46.040
It could be our own additional models,

00:13:46.040 --> 00:13:48.190
also for white us.

00:13:48.190 --> 00:13:49.030
Uh,

00:13:49.030 --> 00:13:53.680
this is a place where you're gonna be start all the services that we're gonna have.

00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:56.520
We will come back and look into this Indeed.

00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:58.590
A on bootstrap.

00:13:58.590 --> 00:13:59.300
It says that Hey,

00:13:59.300 --> 00:14:02.370
this is a component that will be looked in the index strategy TML.

00:14:02.370 --> 00:14:02.920
Now,

00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:06.750
if you just happen to look at the index dot html for a minute,

00:14:06.750 --> 00:14:09.080
it is your app.

00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.360
Rude slash Uproot.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.640
So this is where it's gonna say when angular starts bootstrapping it says,

00:14:14.640 --> 00:14:14.940
Hey,

00:14:14.940 --> 00:14:17.400
I have to look for this app component in the index.

00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:21.630
Html on AB component is identified using this stack.

00:14:21.630 --> 00:14:22.440
The question is,

00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:27.120
how so If I go to the app component So this is a This is basically a something that is

00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.480
imported from this abduct component,

00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:34.370
which is this Abdur component RTs for open thereafter component tortillas.

00:14:34.370 --> 00:14:37.860
You can see that it's exporting a classical at component,

00:14:37.860 --> 00:14:40.640
but it's decorated with that component.

00:14:40.640 --> 00:14:45.680
And one other thing that you will see here is that it is ab dash route and this is a

00:14:45.680 --> 00:14:46.420
selector.

00:14:46.420 --> 00:14:51.810
So since there is no special symbol associated with this like dot our hash,

00:14:51.810 --> 00:14:56.940
it assumes that it's going to be used as attack at routes slash uproot.

00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.700
And that's what actually we see here at would stash uproot.

00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:01.760
So if I had said here,

00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:02.430
don't,

00:15:02.430 --> 00:15:03.450
for example,

00:15:03.450 --> 00:15:10.390
then it looks for a tag any time with a CSS class off uproot.

00:15:10.390 --> 00:15:14.040
So this will not work in this incident.

00:15:14.040 --> 00:15:19.330
This I might have to say deal last equals toe after ash root slash do.

00:15:19.330 --> 00:15:22.040
This is how it should be given on in get.

00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.930
If I had used the hash instead,

00:15:23.930 --> 00:15:30.660
affair dot then I must have to give your I V equals two equals toe uproot.

00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:36.580
So basically those selector off a component determines how that component is identified in

00:15:36.580 --> 00:15:37.570
your HTML,

00:15:37.570 --> 00:15:40.080
so I'm gonna leave it as it is.

00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:42.640
We will come back and look into that later.

00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.820
Change those things on explore,

00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:47.680
experiment on those things.

00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:48.790
But for now,

00:15:48.790 --> 00:15:50.050
I'm gonna leave it as it is.

00:15:50.050 --> 00:15:54.710
I'm gonna save this file on save this file to Andi.

00:15:54.710 --> 00:15:59.000
You can see that this is a straightforward plans with a member variable called Title.

00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000
The title of this First up here on day.

00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:08.550
This title is a variable that can be used in the HTML corresponding to this component.

00:16:08.550 --> 00:16:12.190
So every component will have an HTML associate ID.

00:16:12.190 --> 00:16:13.660
Right now you can see it says Template.

00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.510
You are on that template.

00:16:15.510 --> 00:16:20.750
Ural corresponds to the same folder consisting off Abdullah Component knowledge demon,

00:16:20.750 --> 00:16:21.590
which is right here.

00:16:21.590 --> 00:16:22.920
If I open that,

00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.970
you can see it's a HTML file consisting off some do with an image,

00:16:27.970 --> 00:16:31.000
then the welcome to and you see this variable.

00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.370
That variable is coming from this particular part in this special symbol here,

00:16:36.370 --> 00:16:37.150
curly brackets,

00:16:37.150 --> 00:16:40.940
double curly brackets called interpolation O R.

00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:41.840
Handlebars.

00:16:41.840 --> 00:16:46.580
Handlebars is the A B I that provides support for this template,

00:16:46.580 --> 00:16:47.560
Parsi.

00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:48.660
But anyway,

00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:51.320
the value off the title will be injected over here.

00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:54.160
We have some edge to than we have some links here.

00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.580
So we will not touch any off this stuff.

00:16:56.580 --> 00:17:00.560
And we will run our application and then look into how this is gonna go.

00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:02.610
So I've been open a new terminal.

00:17:02.610 --> 00:17:04.980
All right?

00:17:04.980 --> 00:17:07.560
I'm gonna open a new terminal right now.

00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:08.920
I'm already in that city.

00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:09.530
First.

00:17:09.530 --> 00:17:10.700
I've already done for Stan.

00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:17.660
I'm gonna say n g solve this is actually going toe start a development Web server.

00:17:17.660 --> 00:17:19.160
When it starts,

00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:21.240
it's going to use that back on.

00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:24.220
Dwight back is gonna bundle all the fight that we have.

00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:27.700
The html that DS files everything.

00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:30.150
CS says everything into one single jobless.

00:17:30.150 --> 00:17:30.340
Good.

00:17:30.340 --> 00:17:30.660
Fine.

00:17:30.660 --> 00:17:32.450
Andi in.

00:17:32.450 --> 00:17:34.850
It'll also start our applications.

00:17:34.850 --> 00:17:35.240
If you want.

00:17:35.240 --> 00:17:41.980
You can also say dash for toe open the default browser on DSO the extremophiles,

00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:42.870
the index,

00:17:42.870 --> 00:17:43.460
it's team it.

00:17:43.460 --> 00:17:44.460
So if I do this,

00:17:44.460 --> 00:17:48.650
it might take a while because it the first time it's opening on.

00:17:48.650 --> 00:17:53.520
But it's going to look into all the friends that we have combines starting from the main

00:17:53.520 --> 00:17:59.800
door 30 years and then gets into the entire restructure and build the resident fight.

00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.230
One thing it also does is it's gonna keep that server up and running here.

00:18:05.230 --> 00:18:05.710
As you can see,

00:18:05.710 --> 00:18:06.450
it's still running.

00:18:06.450 --> 00:18:10.210
But as every time I make some changes,

00:18:10.210 --> 00:18:13.830
you will see that the changes will be immediately affected over here.

00:18:13.830 --> 00:18:14.440
For example,

00:18:14.440 --> 00:18:16.320
if I go back to the visuals to the court,

00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:20.190
let me reduce the height off this.

00:18:20.190 --> 00:18:23.320
So instead of this welcome toe Titan,

00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:26.710
I can say hello.

00:18:26.710 --> 00:18:30.110
This'll is lying.

00:18:30.110 --> 00:18:32.350
And then I just used the title,

00:18:32.350 --> 00:18:34.730
and as soon a they save it,

00:18:34.730 --> 00:18:37.200
you will see that there is a compilation going on,

00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.660
and that compilation will.

00:18:38.660 --> 00:18:40.460
Once the compilation is done,

00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:42.890
it's going to trigger very fresh in the browser.

00:18:42.890 --> 00:18:46.780
All I have to do is to press command as our controllers and windows,

00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:49.010
and you'll see that it's a re compiling,

00:18:49.010 --> 00:18:54.170
and in a in a while you can see that it starts on restarts by browser,

00:18:54.170 --> 00:18:54.830
and it is Hello,

00:18:54.830 --> 00:18:55.690
this is my first,

00:18:55.690 --> 00:18:58.330
and instead of this first up,

00:18:58.330 --> 00:18:58.960
I can go home.

00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.440
I go back to my source scored off this year,

00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:09.810
and I can say that this is my forced angular seven on A and save it on.

00:19:09.810 --> 00:19:15.090
The same thing happens on you can see that the variable is now printed over here.

00:19:15.090 --> 00:19:17.250
My first Angula seven app.

00:19:17.250 --> 00:19:20.330
And if you want to remove those links and stuff like that,

00:19:20.330 --> 00:19:23.270
what we see here so I can get it up there entirely.

00:19:23.270 --> 00:19:24.430
You l slash Julia,

00:19:24.430 --> 00:19:26.420
Save it on.

00:19:26.420 --> 00:19:27.780
You can see that it's gone,

00:19:27.780 --> 00:19:29.130
right?

00:19:29.130 --> 00:19:29.840
Of course,

00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.490
this on.

00:19:30.490 --> 00:19:34.600
So I don't need so get it off that Syria.

00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:35.570
It's done.

00:19:35.570 --> 00:19:36.160
As you can see,

00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.600
it's cream fast.

00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:39.590
Andi,

00:19:39.590 --> 00:19:42.130
this is where you can go on changed a lot of things.

00:19:42.130 --> 00:19:42.720
So,

00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:43.440
for example,

00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:48.110
I can go back and add a new component and the components again.

00:19:48.110 --> 00:19:51.610
A bunch off ds html CSS files.

00:19:51.610 --> 00:19:56.680
That's the whole thing that we want to do here in the subsequent application.

00:19:56.680 --> 00:19:59.200
In case if you want our bootstrap,

00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:00.030
for example,

00:20:00.030 --> 00:20:01.980
let's say for type your airport on,

00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.480
I can say partner.

00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:11.800
Now this has an image abbreviation so that visual Studio court supports Emmett Abbreviation

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:11.800
,

00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:18.810
which means I can clear something like PT and button dot bt and dark 50 and primary.

00:20:18.810 --> 00:20:26.330
And then I can hear the curly brackets say This is butter and I can first ender and you'll

00:20:26.330 --> 00:20:31.100
see that the complete HTML Court is generated out of that on This is a really,

00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:36.730
really super cool option we will be using this tour are angular application on Do you?

00:20:36.730 --> 00:20:37.630
By the end of this,

00:20:37.630 --> 00:20:40.850
you should be very comfortable with this and save this.

00:20:40.850 --> 00:20:42.290
Go back to a browser.

00:20:42.290 --> 00:20:44.910
I see a button that's pretty ordinary,

00:20:44.910 --> 00:20:49.350
but But if I goto get good stop dot com on,

00:20:49.350 --> 00:20:53.420
you'll see that there is a This is from Tudor,

00:20:53.420 --> 00:20:54.210
which,

00:20:54.210 --> 00:21:02.270
which is a very popular CSS swimmer on If I goto documentation here on there is a button.

00:21:02.270 --> 00:21:04.030
As you can see under components,

00:21:04.030 --> 00:21:06.150
I should see buttons on.

00:21:06.150 --> 00:21:09.980
There are these buttons Primary secondary success,

00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:10.570
Danger.

00:21:10.570 --> 00:21:13.980
So I'll have to use use the appropriate CSS class names.

00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:14.240
Yes,

00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.730
obedience is required on Bt and secondary primary success,

00:21:18.730 --> 00:21:19.150
Danger,

00:21:19.150 --> 00:21:20.090
warning and so on.

00:21:20.090 --> 00:21:20.890
Andi,

00:21:20.890 --> 00:21:22.810
this is very well documented,

00:21:22.810 --> 00:21:26.870
so you can always come back and have a look it as how to work with a button or anything for

00:21:26.870 --> 00:21:27.360
that matter.

00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:31.220
but in order to work with this for so I need to install.

00:21:31.220 --> 00:21:31.620
So what?

00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:32.140
I'll do them,

00:21:32.140 --> 00:21:32.520
you know,

00:21:32.520 --> 00:21:33.090
control,

00:21:33.090 --> 00:21:34.080
See here first.

00:21:34.080 --> 00:21:41.760
So the developments are already stopped on then I really do nt m i for install on this time

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:41.760
.

00:21:41.760 --> 00:21:44.000
No dash G because it's not a framework.

00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:44.740
Carrots telling.

00:21:44.740 --> 00:21:47.030
It's just a set of library fights,

00:21:47.030 --> 00:21:47.640
your installer,

00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.780
and this is how you do pull struck,

00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.330
and this installs locally.

00:21:53.330 --> 00:21:54.410
For example,

00:21:54.410 --> 00:21:55.910
once I pressed Enter,

00:21:55.910 --> 00:22:01.880
you'll see that it's gonna go to the Net and download the necessary likely fights on Also

00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:03.660
Objects Packaged or Jason.

00:22:03.660 --> 00:22:08.250
So that's going to have a look at that in our editor.

00:22:08.250 --> 00:22:11.310
So I have your package.

00:22:11.310 --> 00:22:18.700
Start to some and you'll see that Packaged or Jason has now been updated with bootstrap for

00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.160
doctor,

00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:19.870
wrote one.

00:22:19.870 --> 00:22:21.680
I got a note models.

00:22:21.680 --> 00:22:24.250
You'll see that there is bootstrap somewhere.

00:22:24.250 --> 00:22:27.100
It'll sequentially alphabetically listed.

00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:29.290
I go to okay,

00:22:29.290 --> 00:22:32.260
Sometimes it doesn't refresh your there the refresh option.

00:22:32.260 --> 00:22:37.850
Click on that on Now I should be able to see under North models.

00:22:37.850 --> 00:22:45.750
I see you see boots stop here The gist and there is a CSS and Js.

00:22:45.750 --> 00:22:49.660
I will select see assis you against like this bootstrap mean doxy.

00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.580
Sso is the file that we have to update in angular dot Jason,

00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:58.680
I'm gonna go in tow the angular you can command be our control,

00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:01.770
be on windows and you take your angular.

00:23:01.770 --> 00:23:04.200
You can see that I get angular than Jason.

00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:07.290
I see that over here this is the location.

00:23:07.290 --> 00:23:09.490
Very can add some CSS,

00:23:09.490 --> 00:23:10.080
for example.

00:23:10.080 --> 00:23:13.610
I can go here and say Lord underscored models.

00:23:13.610 --> 00:23:18.140
That's the location where we have under that we have what's called Boonstra.

00:23:18.140 --> 00:23:29.500
So we have booster dissed CSS and then good strap dar lin dot CSS And with a comma on Syria

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:29.500
,

00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:35.390
it on any changes to the angular Georgeson site that you have done In order for that to

00:23:35.390 --> 00:23:36.310
take effect,

00:23:36.310 --> 00:23:41.120
you must stop the development that server which I will be done and then restarted.

00:23:41.120 --> 00:23:47.830
You can do either Engy so all you can say npm start one in the same this time I don't need

00:23:47.830 --> 00:23:51.450
the browser pash fortune because it's already open on.

00:23:51.450 --> 00:23:53.050
And when they do this,

00:23:53.050 --> 00:23:56.000
if I go back to the browser Andi,

00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:57.490
check my application.

00:23:57.490 --> 00:24:03.550
I should see a button changing with CSS applied on that s it.

00:24:03.550 --> 00:24:04.750
Says combined successfully.

00:24:04.750 --> 00:24:05.620
Didn't refresh here.

00:24:05.620 --> 00:24:06.760
So let's do that manually.

00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:07.800
So when I do a refresh,

00:24:07.800 --> 00:24:11.540
you can see that now the button is a blue collar button on.

00:24:11.540 --> 00:24:11.990
Of course,

00:24:11.990 --> 00:24:13.660
if I go back to my rear score,

00:24:13.660 --> 00:24:17.540
change this from primary toe save danger,

00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:18.380
for example.

00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:19.990
Save it on.

00:24:19.990 --> 00:24:21.540
You can see that's gonna be under it,

00:24:21.540 --> 00:24:22.410
but in in a way,

00:24:22.410 --> 00:24:24.810
right.

00:24:24.810 --> 00:24:27.870
So 20 of options in bootstrap.

00:24:27.870 --> 00:24:30.560
Let's explore that as we go forward.
