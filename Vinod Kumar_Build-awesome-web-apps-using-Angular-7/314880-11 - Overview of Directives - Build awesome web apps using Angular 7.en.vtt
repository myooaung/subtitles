00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.770
directors are perhaps the most important bit of an angular application on,

00:00:04.770 --> 00:00:05.930
If you think about it,

00:00:05.930 --> 00:00:07.930
the most used angular unit,

00:00:07.930 --> 00:00:10.380
the component is actually a directive,

00:00:10.380 --> 00:00:14.650
and angular component is nothing more than a director with the template.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:18.610
When we say that components of the building blood seven angular applications,

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:23.150
we're actually saying that directors are the building blocks of an angular application.

00:00:23.150 --> 00:00:30.360
At the core Directive is a function that executes whenever angular compiler finds it in the

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:30.750
dark,

00:00:30.750 --> 00:00:37.250
Angular directors are used to to extend the power off its TML by giving news in tax.

00:00:37.250 --> 00:00:42.910
Angular directors can be divided into three types components at tribute directives and

00:00:42.910 --> 00:00:44.110
structural directors.

00:00:44.110 --> 00:00:49.040
As we saw earlier components are just directors with templates under the hood.

00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:52.630
They use the victim AP and give us a cleaner way to define them.

00:00:52.630 --> 00:00:55.470
The other two director types do not have templates.

00:00:55.470 --> 00:00:56.340
Instead,

00:00:56.340 --> 00:00:59.460
they're specifically tailored for down manipulations.

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:04.050
Attribute directives manipulate the down by changing its behavior and appearance.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:10.330
We use attribute directives toe apply conditional state elements show all hide elements are

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:14.860
dynamically change the behavior off a component according to a changing property.

00:01:14.860 --> 00:01:18.370
Some of the building attribute directors are in the style.

00:01:18.370 --> 00:01:20.170
NJ class disabled,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:22.590
hidden in just switch and so on.

00:01:22.590 --> 00:01:25.630
Let's take a look at some usage examples off building.

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:29.050
Attribute Directors here disabled on Hidden.

00:01:29.050 --> 00:01:33.120
Having assigned a Boolean expression well,

00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:33.960
faughnder,

00:01:33.960 --> 00:01:35.860
invalid and formed are valid.

00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:37.800
Represent the state of the form.

00:01:37.800 --> 00:01:40.200
So based on the forms validity,

00:01:40.200 --> 00:01:43.290
the button is either disabled or enabled,

00:01:43.290 --> 00:01:46.720
and the other message is shown our Children.

00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:48.400
In this example,

00:01:48.400 --> 00:01:56.580
we are assigning a style property toe do based on an object be once failed color property.

00:01:56.580 --> 00:01:59.420
Here is an example off N G Class Act.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.170
A good director.

00:02:00.170 --> 00:02:05.940
The expression is an object representing some of the CSS classes,

00:02:05.940 --> 00:02:11.800
but whether the class should be used or not is decided based on the value off that which is

00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:12.380
a bullion.

00:02:12.380 --> 00:02:13.840
For example,

00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:19.350
if the ones age is less than 18 an extra danger CSS class is applied.

00:02:19.350 --> 00:02:25.230
If the ones gauge is greater than or equal to 80 extradites success will be applied.

00:02:25.230 --> 00:02:30.250
Structural directives are specifically tailored for creating and destroying Tom elements.

00:02:30.250 --> 00:02:34.810
Some of the building structure directors are NGF Engy,

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:41.190
far off India's which case in this which different structural directors are used in html

00:02:41.190 --> 00:02:45.110
template with an ass trick instead off a square bracket around them.

00:02:45.110 --> 00:02:46.850
For example,

00:02:46.850 --> 00:02:47.930
the NGO.

00:02:47.930 --> 00:02:48.520
If direct,

00:02:48.520 --> 00:02:51.850
you is assigned a Boolean expression here.

00:02:51.850 --> 00:02:56.700
So if the products don't lend is equals to zero,

00:02:56.700 --> 00:02:57.580
then Engy.

00:02:57.580 --> 00:03:01.060
If real ensured that hit three is added to the long.

00:03:01.060 --> 00:03:05.700
But if the condition products Shortland equals 20 is fade,

00:03:05.700 --> 00:03:09.250
then Engy if will remove the extra from the top.
