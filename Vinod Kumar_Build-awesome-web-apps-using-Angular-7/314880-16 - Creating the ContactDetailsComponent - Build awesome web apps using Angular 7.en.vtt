X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
Let's have a new component to our application toe.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:04.990
Display the details of the contact person.

00:00:04.990 --> 00:00:05.960
Andi.

00:00:05.960 --> 00:00:06.850
To do that,

00:00:06.850 --> 00:00:07.960
let's go back to the command,

00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:20.370
prompt and clear a new component called contact details that also add a model class to our

00:00:20.370 --> 00:00:26.570
application so we can work with on a day off contacts or an unusual contact and so on.

00:00:26.570 --> 00:00:27.620
To do so.

00:00:27.620 --> 00:00:35.780
Someone say n g generate class And then I wouldn't get a fuller car model slash and then

00:00:35.780 --> 00:00:37.050
give contact.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:41.030
That's the name that I'm gonna give so it will clear a class.

00:00:41.030 --> 00:00:50.500
There's no update required in after modeler ts onda we know go back to our leader and it's

00:00:50.500 --> 00:00:56.050
goto A source e at folder will see that there is a new component God,

00:00:56.050 --> 00:00:59.300
contact details on apart from the components.

00:00:59.300 --> 00:00:59.460
Now,

00:00:59.460 --> 00:01:03.880
you also have a model which has got a class car contact tortillas on,

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:06.250
which is basically a simple class car contact.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:08.820
There's nothing daily that we're gonna outfield stuff.

00:01:08.820 --> 00:01:09.180
So what?

00:01:09.180 --> 00:01:10.970
You're for example,

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:13.570
if I want an I d for this particular person,

00:01:13.570 --> 00:01:20.120
so I can say I d and then I can say that this is going to be offer Number five on and also

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:21.550
we're gonna say forced me.

00:01:21.550 --> 00:01:22.940
Uh,

00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:24.190
you can say string.

00:01:24.190 --> 00:01:26.070
Last name.

00:01:26.070 --> 00:01:31.960
You can also say string And then you can born doing few things like,

00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:32.480
for example,

00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:34.250
the gender a string.

00:01:34.250 --> 00:01:37.260
And you can also assigned a D for value off.

00:01:37.260 --> 00:01:38.340
Let's save me.

00:01:38.340 --> 00:01:45.210
Then we're gonna add a data book that's are a reliable card d will be on.

00:01:45.210 --> 00:01:47.000
Let's give that a string you one,

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:49.240
though that age type would make much sense.

00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:54.010
But let's make it s d will be We would like to use this for some transformation.

00:01:54.010 --> 00:01:56.810
So converting a data port into age,

00:01:56.810 --> 00:01:58.200
So escape string there,

00:01:58.200 --> 00:02:00.560
then you can have a few other things.

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:01.260
For example,

00:02:01.260 --> 00:02:04.490
I want to have the picture off this person.

00:02:04.490 --> 00:02:09.550
So which is going to be a You are in a link to a your answer.

00:02:09.550 --> 00:02:11.570
Let's keep that other string on.

00:02:11.570 --> 00:02:17.470
Then you're gonna have a lettuce city so that we can service the context by city on then

00:02:17.470 --> 00:02:20.650
probably state country.

00:02:20.650 --> 00:02:23.950
Now some off.

00:02:23.950 --> 00:02:26.230
These are probably optional.

00:02:26.230 --> 00:02:27.160
For example,

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:32.400
I may not know the date of put off a person or I may not have a picture,

00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:34.810
so I can leave that blank on.

00:02:34.810 --> 00:02:38.030
All these are probably optional eso.

00:02:38.030 --> 00:02:40.870
If you want a property to be optional,

00:02:40.870 --> 00:02:43.750
then you have to just put a question mark Attar,

00:02:43.750 --> 00:02:44.660
End of the variable,

00:02:44.660 --> 00:02:45.150
for example.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:49.760
I can say he will be question mark and then say they will be becomes optional.

00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:52.780
So let's also keep this picture optional.

00:02:52.780 --> 00:02:57.620
City optional state on country option Now,

00:02:57.620 --> 00:03:00.310
since we're dealing with the contact details of the person,

00:03:00.310 --> 00:03:02.320
that's also added two more thieves.

00:03:02.320 --> 00:03:04.000
Probably after this,

00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.440
I can say email a strictly on a four,

00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:10.720
which is also a strength.

00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:13.550
And these are the option foods.

00:03:13.550 --> 00:03:14.350
Let's keep that.

00:03:14.350 --> 00:03:19.440
So let's go for my this by pressing arm shift f save the fight.

00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.400
So this is gonna be our model data.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:25.660
That means every contact that we're gonna work with.

00:03:25.660 --> 00:03:29.950
We'll have this particular information now that we have created the modern.

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:36.790
That's going to create the component that can display one contact person students.

00:03:36.790 --> 00:03:38.460
So let's go to the contact details.

00:03:38.460 --> 00:03:40.720
Tears file on Dhere.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:45.250
We want toe create a variable that says contact.

00:03:45.250 --> 00:03:51.490
It is a very blame off day called contact and you can see we get the auto import.

00:03:51.490 --> 00:03:52.210
If you don't get,

00:03:52.210 --> 00:03:54.240
you might have to manually import the same thing.

00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:00.820
So I select this auto import or it is going to take on absolute part,

00:04:00.820 --> 00:04:01.060
right?

00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:06.260
So we can also say that it has to come from a related part because we're already in the APP

00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:06.800
folder,

00:04:06.800 --> 00:04:09.010
so we can as well say here,

00:04:09.010 --> 00:04:17.060
daughter slash Then you can specify another doctor slash and then you can say modern on.

00:04:17.060 --> 00:04:17.920
Of course,

00:04:17.920 --> 00:04:19.170
Wanted it already did.

00:04:19.170 --> 00:04:21.030
So let's give this as dot,

00:04:21.030 --> 00:04:21.240
dot,

00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.920
slash model slash convent.

00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.350
So this is a file that contains our conduct class on.

00:04:28.350 --> 00:04:33.520
We are important that now it's not that we have important this so we can initialize this.

00:04:33.520 --> 00:04:33.970
Technically,

00:04:33.970 --> 00:04:38.240
this is supposed to come from some remote web service endpoint,

00:04:38.240 --> 00:04:40.500
which we're going to do it a bit later.

00:04:40.500 --> 00:04:43.430
But right now I'm on initialize that are quoted value,

00:04:43.430 --> 00:04:44.290
and the question is,

00:04:44.290 --> 00:04:45.490
should I do it over here?

00:04:45.490 --> 00:04:47.740
Are should do it over here now,

00:04:47.740 --> 00:04:49.490
as a general rule of time.

00:04:49.490 --> 00:04:53.250
So we keep this constructor only for dependency injection,

00:04:53.250 --> 00:04:56.010
but as this one for all initialization.

00:04:56.010 --> 00:04:56.630
So,

00:04:56.630 --> 00:04:57.340
to that end,

00:04:57.340 --> 00:05:01.030
let's go and create a distort contact equals toe.

00:05:01.030 --> 00:05:03.410
I can say new contract on.

00:05:03.410 --> 00:05:06.020
You have to supply some values for this.

00:05:06.020 --> 00:05:09.090
I can say here this start contact aren't on.

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.470
Of course,

00:05:09.470 --> 00:05:11.290
the minimum feels that we have.

00:05:11.290 --> 00:05:14.690
So let's give ID equals to one on this dark contact.

00:05:14.690 --> 00:05:15.830
First name,

00:05:15.830 --> 00:05:16.130
right?

00:05:16.130 --> 00:05:17.460
So that's your first name.

00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:18.820
I'm gonna give my name.

00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:22.630
So I'm gonna give be not this'd or contact.

00:05:22.630 --> 00:05:27.050
Our last name equals toe marks the mandatory fields.

00:05:27.050 --> 00:05:28.840
I'll be this dark contact,

00:05:28.840 --> 00:05:29.890
wrote email.

00:05:29.890 --> 00:05:35.870
We know that we don't birth call on one last contract.

00:05:35.870 --> 00:05:39.670
Art country equals to engage,

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:41.620
but I forgot.

00:05:41.620 --> 00:05:44.390
Start contact or you will be equal.

00:05:44.390 --> 00:05:45.530
So let's give it in a year.

00:05:45.530 --> 00:05:46.220
So format.

00:05:46.220 --> 00:05:48.880
So this is gonna be like this.

00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.340
So now that we have initialized this value like I said,

00:05:53.340 --> 00:05:55.860
this is gonna come from a back and saris,

00:05:55.860 --> 00:05:57.090
So we'll do that later.

00:05:57.090 --> 00:05:58.630
We do have this data.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:06:02.020
Now we have to display this on the HTML.

00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:04.250
So let's go to the HTML part of it,

00:06:04.250 --> 00:06:07.880
which currently simply says that contact details work.

00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:10.950
What we would like to display them in a nice format.

00:06:10.950 --> 00:06:15.300
Maybe labels followed by details of that.

00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:16.650
So I'm gonna use that.

00:06:16.650 --> 00:06:18.150
Do not roll.

00:06:18.150 --> 00:06:24.640
Consisting off deal dot Call into two or Rho.

00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.610
I needed two columns on,

00:06:26.610 --> 00:06:27.040
but this,

00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:27.600
of course,

00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:28.830
will be one.

00:06:28.830 --> 00:06:30.620
But this is for first name,

00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:31.030
last name,

00:06:31.030 --> 00:06:31.840
for example.

00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:34.330
But I won't like this so many of them.

00:06:34.330 --> 00:06:38.060
So I need a approximately around 11 off them.

00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:40.880
If I don't want to display idea eating around a doctor.

00:06:40.880 --> 00:06:45.620
Let's keep it around eight so I can go back and save your multiplied by aid.

00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:49.730
So I'm gonna give now eight of those with two columns each.

00:06:49.730 --> 00:06:55.430
So if I press controlled space at the end and entered and you can see we got completely all

00:06:55.430 --> 00:06:56.190
the details,

00:06:56.190 --> 00:06:58.020
so remembers their first name.

00:06:58.020 --> 00:06:58.420
Right?

00:06:58.420 --> 00:07:02.590
So that's the first mean on this is gonna be lost.

00:07:02.590 --> 00:07:02.950
Me?

00:07:02.950 --> 00:07:04.950
Let's give your,

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:06.130
uh,

00:07:06.130 --> 00:07:07.130
date of books.

00:07:07.130 --> 00:07:13.020
It doesn't have to be any sequence I amounts are gonna take your email.

00:07:13.020 --> 00:07:20.460
I just This is gonna be fun number on,

00:07:20.460 --> 00:07:24.220
and we have a city stage,

00:07:24.220 --> 00:07:27.810
so we also have a gender,

00:07:27.810 --> 00:07:30.540
but will come back on that in a few minutes.

00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:31.640
So now,

00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:32.060
ofcourse,

00:07:32.060 --> 00:07:33.110
to fill the values,

00:07:33.110 --> 00:07:34.870
I can use the interpolation,

00:07:34.870 --> 00:07:38.150
so I can say a contact about first names.

00:07:38.150 --> 00:07:38.960
Now,

00:07:38.960 --> 00:07:42.750
contact here is the variable that we have created over here.

00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:48.770
So the variables were off the component are accessible to our view.

00:07:48.770 --> 00:07:49.840
So this is the view,

00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:53.080
and we can access them and bring them in this particular fashion.

00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.550
So I'm gonna copy this on paste it.

00:07:55.550 --> 00:07:57.560
This is gonna be the last name.

00:07:57.560 --> 00:07:58.690
The sprint.

00:07:58.690 --> 00:08:01.450
Here they will be one last.

00:08:01.450 --> 00:08:02.550
That's the country here.

00:08:02.550 --> 00:08:06.270
So we have saved this.

00:08:06.270 --> 00:08:08.660
But if you go back to your application,

00:08:08.660 --> 00:08:12.950
it doesn't show up that because currently this is phone component.

00:08:12.950 --> 00:08:15.070
So we need to change that.

00:08:15.070 --> 00:08:18.530
And that's done in app component HTML.

00:08:18.530 --> 00:08:19.170
Currently,

00:08:19.170 --> 00:08:21.890
we're using PB home where,

00:08:21.890 --> 00:08:23.810
as I have no safe TV,

00:08:23.810 --> 00:08:26.160
the ash contact dash digits.

00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.950
That's the new component that were created.

00:08:28.950 --> 00:08:30.510
So if I go back to your now,

00:08:30.510 --> 00:08:34.430
you can see that before first name last name That's attractive again.

00:08:34.430 --> 00:08:34.650
Again.

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:37.460
See that it's occupying the 50% off the rule.

00:08:37.460 --> 00:08:38.710
And if you don't want that,

00:08:38.710 --> 00:08:42.090
you may want to divide that by giving an appropriate size.

00:08:42.090 --> 00:08:43.220
And so how do we do that?

00:08:43.220 --> 00:08:49.320
We can go to the contact details H demon on for each of these columns that we have got over

00:08:49.320 --> 00:08:49.810
here.

00:08:49.810 --> 00:08:52.870
We have to define a sizer.

00:08:52.870 --> 00:08:55.950
It's up to you to define what's the size you want.

00:08:55.950 --> 00:09:02.000
Now be sure Studio Court has a day off selecting a patent takes,

00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:02.490
for example,

00:09:02.490 --> 00:09:03.710
I can select like this.

00:09:03.710 --> 00:09:07.110
I can best commander B or controlled be on Windows.

00:09:07.110 --> 00:09:10.180
You can see this electing the next occurrence as they go forward.

00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:12.100
And for each one of them,

00:09:12.100 --> 00:09:13.450
I can no come back.

00:09:13.450 --> 00:09:16.340
Your I can say Call STM Dash,

00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.540
that's a four.

00:09:17.540 --> 00:09:23.320
And then I can come down again and they can opt in each of these columns to be called S

00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.260
them eight and I saved this.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:25.710
Now,

00:09:25.710 --> 00:09:26.880
if I go back over here,

00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:29.840
you can see that it's gonna occupy four.

00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:31.770
And then this is a campaign eight.

00:09:31.770 --> 00:09:32.560
Of course,

00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:39.680
it's a good idea if I type your contact details so that's going on one and it's no head.

00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:39.870
Oh,

00:09:39.870 --> 00:09:41.020
so I'd say history,

00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:42.240
I think Contact.

00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:42.640
Dig.

00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:48.040
It's probably a HR horizontal do right?

00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.340
So that's how it's gonna look like now.

00:09:49.340 --> 00:09:50.650
Now,

00:09:50.650 --> 00:09:52.210
while this is all good,

00:09:52.210 --> 00:10:00.000
we would like to display this as name of the person as we know come are also Mr our mess

00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.060
depending on the gender.

00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:04.770
So that's going Try that by doing this,

00:10:04.770 --> 00:10:07.050
combining these two rows into one.

00:10:07.050 --> 00:10:10.580
So just stay pure name off the person on.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:12.860
Then this is gonna be contact.

00:10:12.860 --> 00:10:13.980
But first name.

00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:18.190
I don't need any of this stuff now on then a space,

00:10:18.190 --> 00:10:19.920
Another interpellation.

00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.290
So this is what we can do now here so you can see that is going to say name is we know coma

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:25.290
.

00:10:25.290 --> 00:10:28.860
But what if I want to display Mr our mess?

00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.130
I can do that on.

00:10:30.130 --> 00:10:35.120
So let me make some room over here and then I'm going to use an interpolation and say here

00:10:35.120 --> 00:10:39.220
that contract or gender people equals toe.

00:10:39.220 --> 00:10:41.510
Let's a male caution,

00:10:41.510 --> 00:10:42.500
Maher said,

00:10:42.500 --> 00:10:43.920
Mr is the value,

00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.020
otherwise it's missed is the better.

00:10:47.020 --> 00:10:52.860
So now we have added a logic to our view,

00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:54.400
which is technically wrong.

00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:56.350
But it does the job you can see.

00:10:56.350 --> 00:11:01.320
Now we have got Mr we not come on being the name of the person.

00:11:01.320 --> 00:11:01.950
So let's say,

00:11:01.950 --> 00:11:02.510
for example,

00:11:02.510 --> 00:11:05.860
I go back to the DS corresponding to that on.

00:11:05.860 --> 00:11:08.300
Let's change this tool for examples,

00:11:08.300 --> 00:11:09.460
Jane Doe.

00:11:09.460 --> 00:11:12.050
Of course,

00:11:12.050 --> 00:11:13.100
this is supposed to be.

00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:15.660
Does that example?

00:11:15.660 --> 00:11:16.780
Come on,

00:11:16.780 --> 00:11:19.880
let's changes to female on a senator.

00:11:19.880 --> 00:11:20.530
Save this.

00:11:20.530 --> 00:11:21.590
And if I come back here,

00:11:21.590 --> 00:11:24.290
you can see Miss Gender and it's working.

00:11:24.290 --> 00:11:29.260
But combining a business logic in view is not a good idea.

00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.380
So this is a logic.

00:11:30.380 --> 00:11:30.820
No matter,

00:11:30.820 --> 00:11:32.520
even if it's a very small logic,

00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:38.490
it's still a logic on what we would like to do is tow convert this into something that is

00:11:38.490 --> 00:11:39.210
reusable.

00:11:39.210 --> 00:11:41.850
So we'll see that in a minute as what is that?

00:11:41.850 --> 00:11:42.720
Similarly,

00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.730
here I have a day off,

00:11:43.730 --> 00:11:44.370
but right,

00:11:44.370 --> 00:11:49.940
so But what if I want to display the age of the person where I don't have the age of the

00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:50.260
person?

00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:54.630
But I do have the people be and I should be able to calculate that each of the person so

00:11:54.630 --> 00:11:58.750
all these things can be done by using what a scar pipes on.

00:11:58.750 --> 00:12:01.070
We will see that in the next video
