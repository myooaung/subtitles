WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.250
so no overheads.

00:00:01.250 --> 00:00:06.380
Two TB Web service Back in this up and running it's time for us toe.

00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.500
Consume the theme in our service.

00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:11.020
Let's goto our application.

00:00:11.020 --> 00:00:16.460
The first thing that you have to do is to include a model called It's TTP Claimed model and

00:00:16.460 --> 00:00:20.340
that is to be done by going toe at at my duty.

00:00:20.340 --> 00:00:20.910
Yes,

00:00:20.910 --> 00:00:23.400
and we have to act that imports here.

00:00:23.400 --> 00:00:24.120
But of course,

00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:24.540
before that,

00:00:24.540 --> 00:00:26.210
we have to import the model itself.

00:00:26.210 --> 00:00:35.220
So we're gonna say import from at angular slash common slash STD on what is coming from

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:41.920
that is a module part as http client modern on Once we have added that here,

00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:44.980
that has to be included in our imports section.

00:00:44.980 --> 00:00:45.750
Now,

00:00:45.750 --> 00:00:51.420
other application depends on another module and this model has a salaries called http

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:52.050
client,

00:00:52.050 --> 00:00:53.140
if you remember,

00:00:53.140 --> 00:00:56.100
we can inject a service in tow.

00:00:56.100 --> 00:00:58.340
Another service are component.

00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:04.640
So what we want to do is we goto our phone book surveys and we say that we want to consume

00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:10.780
that http client service and the way we do it is by typing five it from American.

00:01:10.780 --> 00:01:13.820
Call it'll Http on off time,

00:01:13.820 --> 00:01:21.520
it's TTP client and thats going toe to import the 2nd 1 I should be using from at angular

00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:22.740
common its GDP.

00:01:22.740 --> 00:01:23.730
So we got that.

00:01:23.730 --> 00:01:25.630
Now that we have Http,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:27.330
we cannot consume the same thing.

00:01:27.330 --> 00:01:28.690
So how do we do that?

00:01:28.690 --> 00:01:31.150
So we're going to say here is start,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:37.460
http dot Get and we have to supply a u r and the urine for is very simple.

00:01:37.460 --> 00:01:46.980
So it's gonna be scdp local host 43 double zero slash contact slash Plus this ivy that

00:01:46.980 --> 00:01:51.080
we're looking for So I can see here plus t now,

00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:53.050
this function when you call,

00:01:53.050 --> 00:01:59.260
it's gonna redone what's called as an observable and the observable has to be consumed

00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:00.320
rather than say,

00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:06.240
the observable must be subscript So I can simply say return here on that gives me an error

00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:11.150
because here you can see that we have told that the written data type is contact.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:14.460
But as this is going to return an observable on,

00:02:14.460 --> 00:02:18.790
what we do here is now we're going to say that this is going to return on observable,

00:02:18.790 --> 00:02:24.780
which is from Rx Js and we say that it could be anything Now we know that it's a contact

00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:30.590
object But right now we will say any year So which means when this function is called,

00:02:30.590 --> 00:02:33.480
it is actually going to the done on observable.

00:02:33.480 --> 00:02:39.020
And if you remember where we have called were called in our component contact details and

00:02:39.020 --> 00:02:41.380
in the contact cardinals component es.

00:02:41.380 --> 00:02:46.280
So we said here this start contact equals toe an observable again.

00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:46.830
That is wrong,

00:02:46.830 --> 00:02:50.280
because contact is a variable off type contact.

00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:52.040
But as this is an observable,

00:02:52.040 --> 00:02:52.390
you know,

00:02:52.390 --> 00:02:55.750
the way we can assign is so we say first,

00:02:55.750 --> 00:02:58.570
these stocks that we start get contact details,

00:02:58.570 --> 00:03:00.870
which is an observable on observable,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:04.270
has to be subscribed by using a dark subscribe,

00:03:04.270 --> 00:03:07.290
and the substrate gives three callbacks.

00:03:07.290 --> 00:03:12.350
The first callback is basically about when you get the actually,

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:12.550
don't.

00:03:12.550 --> 00:03:14.640
What do you want to go when you get an edit?

00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:15.240
What do you want to do?

00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.400
That a second perimeter.

00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:18.730
And when the actual subscription is complete,

00:03:18.730 --> 00:03:19.990
what you want to do now?

00:03:19.990 --> 00:03:20.600
In our case,

00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.420
we just want to receive the data.

00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:25.030
So when the data is available,

00:03:25.030 --> 00:03:26.230
give it to me.

00:03:26.230 --> 00:03:30.560
I would like to assign toe distort contact equals toe data,

00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:37.300
and this is what we're trying to do here If I format this so we now call the function and

00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.890
when the object is returned,

00:03:38.890 --> 00:03:40.090
the observable is return.

00:03:40.090 --> 00:03:43.520
We subscribe to that on whenever data is available,

00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.930
the data is given to me and I'm assigning that.

00:03:45.930 --> 00:03:46.240
Oh,

00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:47.400
they start contact.

00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:50.810
So I'm gonna save this go back toe browser.

00:03:50.810 --> 00:03:51.880
If you see now,

00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:54.230
we get data off a different person Now also,

00:03:54.230 --> 00:03:56.870
you can see that there is an error here initially,

00:03:56.870 --> 00:03:59.580
So it's just cannot find picture off undefined.

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.350
Let's do one thing that's clear the screen and then reload once more.

00:04:03.350 --> 00:04:04.180
Onda,

00:04:04.180 --> 00:04:04.640
uh,

00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:11.280
see that we get an editor here and the reason why this is another now Andi not earlier is

00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:13.610
because when the component is loaded,

00:04:13.610 --> 00:04:15.910
the contact object is empty.

00:04:15.910 --> 00:04:17.280
It's undefined right now,

00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:17.580
Rachel,

00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:19.130
because we just declared the data type.

00:04:19.130 --> 00:04:20.420
But you're not assigned anything.

00:04:20.420 --> 00:04:22.870
We have not ascend anything in the constructor.

00:04:22.870 --> 00:04:25.960
We're not ascend anything in the NGO on in it.

00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.820
Also on better be assigning.

00:04:27.820 --> 00:04:32.530
We're actually has any a later point in time when the actually dies available.

00:04:32.530 --> 00:04:34.460
So But before that,

00:04:34.460 --> 00:04:40.970
the component is loaded on the U I onda the component HTML If you look it is trying to do

00:04:40.970 --> 00:04:44.280
some kind of a picture here and this is undefined at this point in time,

00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:45.800
on and undefined.

00:04:45.800 --> 00:04:50.330
The dark picture is an editor and that's what actually you're getting interrupt Cannot read

00:04:50.330 --> 00:04:52.190
property picture off undefined.

00:04:52.190 --> 00:04:52.870
Now,

00:04:52.870 --> 00:04:59.940
one easy fix for this would be just initialized this in either In the image are here itself

00:04:59.940 --> 00:05:04.680
equals toe new contact without any perimeters.

00:05:04.680 --> 00:05:05.530
Onda.

00:05:05.530 --> 00:05:09.090
Now that should solve the problem on you can see that the interest,

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:09.640
Of course.

00:05:09.640 --> 00:05:10.290
Initially,

00:05:10.290 --> 00:05:15.230
it's still going to go to a picture on Not only they're not valued picture,

00:05:15.230 --> 00:05:16.250
so that's why it is giving.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:17.580
But that is fine.

00:05:17.580 --> 00:05:20.520
We can still awarded by adding a dummy picture.

00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.840
But this is okay,

00:05:21.840 --> 00:05:24.810
just in case if I go here and then instead of one.

00:05:24.810 --> 00:05:27.830
If I say 45 save it now,

00:05:27.830 --> 00:05:29.540
should see different person,

00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.320
right?

00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:35.550
This is exactly how to consume a rest endpoint using http client,

00:05:35.550 --> 00:05:37.850
we're gonna do some re factoring now,

00:05:37.850 --> 00:05:40.570
so if I go back to the service,

00:05:40.570 --> 00:05:44.340
you can see that this urine would be now used in multiple places.

00:05:44.340 --> 00:05:44.780
Obviously,

00:05:44.780 --> 00:05:46.970
it's not a good idea to keep it over here.

00:05:46.970 --> 00:05:49.660
So I'm gonna just type this as based urine,

00:05:49.660 --> 00:05:52.260
which I don't have Someone create a variable.

00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:53.040
Your call,

00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:54.200
CONST.

00:05:54.200 --> 00:05:57.470
Based urine equals toe this and that string.

00:05:57.470 --> 00:06:00.680
So now I have a simple mechanism over here.

00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.390
And of course,

00:06:01.390 --> 00:06:02.840
we're gonna write more and more functions,

00:06:02.840 --> 00:06:05.230
like get all contacts on,

00:06:05.230 --> 00:06:07.610
add a new contract and so on and so forth.
