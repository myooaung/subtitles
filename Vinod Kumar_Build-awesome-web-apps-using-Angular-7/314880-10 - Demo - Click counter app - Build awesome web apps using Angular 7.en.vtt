X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.710
in this money.

00:00:00.710 --> 00:00:04.140
Let's go and create this at counter component.

00:00:04.140 --> 00:00:09.620
So where we want toe provide a number initial value on provide a couple of buttons to

00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:15.710
implement as elastic limit the same thing This way we understand the concept off data

00:00:15.710 --> 00:00:16.270
binding.

00:00:16.270 --> 00:00:17.970
So let's go and have a look at that.

00:00:17.970 --> 00:00:21.780
Let me close all these fines on my right leg on.

00:00:21.780 --> 00:00:23.790
We have a collapse on abundance.

00:00:23.790 --> 00:00:25.040
That's really need now.

00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:27.510
So I have my source code visible properly.

00:00:27.510 --> 00:00:35.010
I go to my AB and then I can look for components at counter and there is a T s file.

00:00:35.010 --> 00:00:36.440
So this is a T s file,

00:00:36.440 --> 00:00:39.250
which is the backbone off a component.

00:00:39.250 --> 00:00:41.850
So this is you can say engine part of a component.

00:00:41.850 --> 00:00:44.210
And this is the presentation part of the company,

00:00:44.210 --> 00:00:46.170
which simply says APP works right now,

00:00:46.170 --> 00:00:51.040
the what I can do is I can declare a variable inside this class which becomes a member

00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:52.120
variable of the class.

00:00:52.120 --> 00:00:55.170
I can market us private if I want other ways.

00:00:55.170 --> 00:00:56.040
It's still fine.

00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:56.950
For example,

00:00:56.950 --> 00:01:00.860
I can say count on day because we re within typescript.

00:01:00.860 --> 00:01:03.690
We can define the variable Toby off a particular type,

00:01:03.690 --> 00:01:05.850
I can say number like this.

00:01:05.850 --> 00:01:06.370
Now,

00:01:06.370 --> 00:01:07.550
this is really nice,

00:01:07.550 --> 00:01:10.310
because that way combined time will give another.

00:01:10.310 --> 00:01:10.620
In case.

00:01:10.620 --> 00:01:14.190
If I'm trying to ascend something non numeric value to the count,

00:01:14.190 --> 00:01:19.140
he can also assign a default value in getting for assigning a value.

00:01:19.140 --> 00:01:19.920
Over here,

00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.480
there is no need to mention that this is a number,

00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:27.960
but you can always go and say equals 20 as the initial value if you want.

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:30.000
Now the other place to initialize.

00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:32.990
As you can see that there is a constructor for a particular class,

00:01:32.990 --> 00:01:35.010
there's also an NGO on it.

00:01:35.010 --> 00:01:35.260
Now,

00:01:35.260 --> 00:01:38.970
Constructor is typical JavaScript class constructor.

00:01:38.970 --> 00:01:40.820
So at this point in time,

00:01:40.820 --> 00:01:46.040
classes being instance created it is not it a component that means angular is not going to

00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.340
be monitoring this.

00:01:47.340 --> 00:01:52.180
So if you want angular toe initially something not JavaScript,

00:01:52.180 --> 00:01:55.750
then NGO on it is the function for the job.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.750
So that comes because of an implement on in it into fists.

00:01:59.750 --> 00:02:03.390
The ah knitted interface makes sure that you have this function.

00:02:03.390 --> 00:02:03.850
For example,

00:02:03.850 --> 00:02:04.780
if I don't have it,

00:02:04.780 --> 00:02:09.640
you can see your typescript is giving another saying that at our counter component it says

00:02:09.640 --> 00:02:12.970
incorrectly implements that interface on in it on.

00:02:12.970 --> 00:02:14.080
You must provide that.

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.850
So if you see that there is a light bulb here,

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:19.170
we escort gives me an option again.

00:02:19.170 --> 00:02:24.800
Basic Commander don't are controlled out on windows and that's going to show you implement

00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.150
interface on in it.

00:02:26.150 --> 00:02:29.690
Of course I can select this on the court comes over here.

00:02:29.690 --> 00:02:30.100
Of course,

00:02:30.100 --> 00:02:35.050
you need to probably pull this down because we want that to be in that place.

00:02:35.050 --> 00:02:36.800
It has thrown new editor.

00:02:36.800 --> 00:02:38.340
We don't want to throw another.

00:02:38.340 --> 00:02:39.550
Instead,

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:43.480
we can say they start count equals 20 Now,

00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:45.670
very important that you have to say this.

00:02:45.670 --> 00:02:50.330
Start here because if you're coming from other languages like Java WASI Shop R C plus plus

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:50.330
,

00:02:50.330 --> 00:02:54.490
you can just do this where it looked for a local variable.

00:02:54.490 --> 00:02:55.320
It is not fun.

00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:56.100
It will take a member.

00:02:56.100 --> 00:02:56.300
Really.

00:02:56.300 --> 00:02:57.550
But But unlike that,

00:02:57.550 --> 00:03:00.870
JavaScript on typescript say that no,

00:03:00.870 --> 00:03:03.080
if you specified without the disk a work,

00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:06.340
it will be looking for a local variable between own house.

00:03:06.340 --> 00:03:07.230
Andi.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.140
It says that we have to mandatorily use the this keyword again.

00:03:10.140 --> 00:03:11.660
You can see that there is delightful.

00:03:11.660 --> 00:03:16.450
I can press control dark and then enter our can You there second option here.

00:03:16.450 --> 00:03:18.550
So be careful when you're selecting options.

00:03:18.550 --> 00:03:22.980
Does that count equals 20 And now I have a value over here.

00:03:22.980 --> 00:03:23.730
Zero.

00:03:23.730 --> 00:03:27.730
I can present this in the HTML in whatever the way I want.

00:03:27.730 --> 00:03:29.560
So let's go to the HTML on.

00:03:29.560 --> 00:03:32.330
Probably get it off that on any type your age,

00:03:32.330 --> 00:03:39.220
three on and say the count Currently he's on.

00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:41.660
Then I can use a curly bracket and then I can,

00:03:41.660 --> 00:03:42.060
like,

00:03:42.060 --> 00:03:43.760
coughed like this.

00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.030
This is an interpolation off the values,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:51.610
basically that whatever the value in your model plants is there that actually will be

00:03:51.610 --> 00:03:52.540
printed over here.

00:03:52.540 --> 00:03:54.400
So if I go back to the browser,

00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.700
it is count currently zero.

00:03:56.700 --> 00:04:02.420
But we would like to provide a couple of buttons s so that we can implement our equipment.

00:04:02.420 --> 00:04:03.900
So to provide the buttons,

00:04:03.900 --> 00:04:05.510
I'm gonna provide a Parton,

00:04:05.510 --> 00:04:08.800
Bt and Bt and primary.

00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:11.350
That's the class names that we're gonna use.

00:04:11.350 --> 00:04:20.270
Dick Clement and I'm gonna copy paste the same thing and change this toe implement Save it

00:04:20.270 --> 00:04:26.240
pardons to colonize the year increment and Dick Clement whatever I want to provide a

00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:26.860
functionally.

00:04:26.860 --> 00:04:28.770
So when I click on this increment each time,

00:04:28.770 --> 00:04:31.220
I should see this particular value be incremental.

00:04:31.220 --> 00:04:36.820
So which means we need to trigger a function called from these buttons on the functions

00:04:36.820 --> 00:04:38.270
must take this to work here.

00:04:38.270 --> 00:04:39.350
So what we do,

00:04:39.350 --> 00:04:41.250
we will provide two functions.

00:04:41.250 --> 00:04:43.760
I can say you're inclement,

00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:44.530
Andi.

00:04:44.530 --> 00:04:46.460
A regular job listed function.

00:04:46.460 --> 00:04:50.100
I consider this a your disturbed phone plus plus and then,

00:04:50.100 --> 00:04:50.580
of course,

00:04:50.580 --> 00:04:51.510
disagreement.

00:04:51.510 --> 00:04:53.370
Which is supposed to say this?

00:04:53.370 --> 00:04:55.050
Start count minus minus.

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:59.170
I'm red using the value off that Now Harder Call this right.

00:04:59.170 --> 00:05:00.040
So it's very,

00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.940
very simple in angular,

00:05:01.940 --> 00:05:08.090
because now they have provided a a simple syntax toe call that function directly over here

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:08.090
.

00:05:08.090 --> 00:05:09.970
What I can do that can simply say,

00:05:09.970 --> 00:05:12.060
use around bracket on,

00:05:12.060 --> 00:05:17.190
Then use the event that you want to find and you can see that this rear scored is helping

00:05:17.190 --> 00:05:19.300
me with what are the different options that we have?

00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.450
We want to use the clicking mint and the clicking when I can say Dick Clement.

00:05:24.450 --> 00:05:30.130
I know that we're school helped me by looking at the class and then use me the function

00:05:30.130 --> 00:05:33.510
that is available on here I can say once again,

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.500
a click event equals toe inclement.

00:05:36.500 --> 00:05:37.320
Andi,

00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:38.350
save this.

00:05:38.350 --> 00:05:42.480
It's also put everything in a something called Container,

00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:48.460
so armed shift F will form at your court savage.

00:05:48.460 --> 00:05:54.010
And if I go back over to my application on the browser churches,

00:05:54.010 --> 00:05:56.170
if sometimes it doesn't refresh,

00:05:56.170 --> 00:05:58.050
just refresh on your room.

00:05:58.050 --> 00:05:59.360
If I implement this,

00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:02.800
you see that it's implementing automatically on Deke,

00:06:02.800 --> 00:06:04.230
lamenting also right.

00:06:04.230 --> 00:06:08.340
You can see that when I click on this particular button,

00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:11.580
the actual function is being in work.

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.650
So that's a binding.

00:06:12.650 --> 00:06:16.740
What were binding your is a button to have function on.

00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.480
The function changes the value off the model data.

00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.120
And every time the model that has changed this particular value is reflected automatically

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:25.120
,

00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:26.950
and this is called data mining.

00:06:26.950 --> 00:06:28.440
So we have a method binding,

00:06:28.440 --> 00:06:29.780
and we have a data binding.

00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.440
While this date of ending what you're seeing is a one reddit about it,

00:06:33.440 --> 00:06:36.580
which means that if I have a text box here on,

00:06:36.580 --> 00:06:40.160
I want the value to be changed when the user changes the value.

00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.150
If I want that toe,

00:06:41.150 --> 00:06:45.780
affect this particular variable that's supposed to be a two way binding So right now what

00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:49.150
we're doing is a one were binding were from the model.

00:06:49.150 --> 00:06:51.110
Later we're updating the view.

00:06:51.110 --> 00:06:53.650
White salsa is not done yet,

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:55.440
so we're going to see that in future radios.

00:06:55.440 --> 00:06:56.050
Anyways,

00:06:56.050 --> 00:06:56.940
however,

00:06:56.940 --> 00:07:04.090
we are doing a method binding on one way data binding over here so I can implement as well

00:07:04.090 --> 00:07:04.950
as agreement.
