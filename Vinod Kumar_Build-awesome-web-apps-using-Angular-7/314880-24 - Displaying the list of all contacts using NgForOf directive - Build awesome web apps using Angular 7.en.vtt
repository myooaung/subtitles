WEBVTT
X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.640
Now that we have all the functions needed for application,

00:00:03.640 --> 00:00:06.150
let's are more components on this time around.

00:00:06.150 --> 00:00:10.030
We'll add a component that can get on the contacts and display.

00:00:10.030 --> 00:00:16.560
So that's going to create a new component by typing N g G C for gender components.

00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.490
And we want that in component.

00:00:18.490 --> 00:00:19.080
Older,

00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:24.880
Let's say it's called Contact that list on We don't want Spec.

00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:30.980
So with the doctor spectacles to fuss and that's just perfect equals two PB for phone book

00:00:30.980 --> 00:00:33.110
that's going to create three classes.

00:00:33.110 --> 00:00:38.440
Html CSS is a typescript class and also updates our APP.

00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.010
Modernity is with respect to the declaration section,

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:45.350
so let's go back to our core and open the theme.

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:49.520
So let's open contact list component of TS,

00:00:49.520 --> 00:00:54.150
which is here and will declare a variable off contacts at it.

00:00:54.150 --> 00:00:55.120
So let's calm it.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.830
Ask contacts,

00:00:56.830 --> 00:01:00.050
prudent off an array off contacted.

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:06.070
I know that it's giving me another because we have toe import the same cypress commanders

00:01:06.070 --> 00:01:11.560
are controlled out on windows and that imported we haven't initialized this,

00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.010
adding,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:13.780
so if you want to get initial,

00:01:13.780 --> 00:01:16.530
is this true and empty array like this?

00:01:16.530 --> 00:01:20.450
But that's really not it worked because we're gonna just initialize that in the n G on in

00:01:20.450 --> 00:01:20.760
it,

00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:22.610
using our service function.

00:01:22.610 --> 00:01:25.070
So the service is an injectable,

00:01:25.070 --> 00:01:29.010
so obviously we have to inject it into our constructors.

00:01:29.010 --> 00:01:32.010
It's a private That's criticism.

00:01:32.010 --> 00:01:32.850
Respectable,

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:35.100
off taped phone book salaries,

00:01:35.100 --> 00:01:43.110
this talk surgeries don't we can say get on contacts and we got the function,

00:01:43.110 --> 00:01:45.500
the threatens and observable,

00:01:45.500 --> 00:01:47.000
which we need to subscribe.

00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.000
Let's call it a start.

00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:48.780
Subscribe.

00:01:48.780 --> 00:01:53.840
The first argument is the combat that receives the response object,

00:01:53.840 --> 00:01:56.040
which is another of context that we know.

00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.550
So we cannot stay here.

00:01:57.550 --> 00:01:59.550
Whatever the response that comes,

00:01:59.550 --> 00:02:04.740
we want to assign toe the start context equals tow it,

00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:07.130
and they should actually take it off,

00:02:07.130 --> 00:02:11.320
retrieving the first page data in order to test the same thing.

00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:15.620
Let's go to the HTML on tried to retrieve the details off the conduct.

00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:19.190
So let's go to that and it says contact list works.

00:02:19.190 --> 00:02:22.240
But instead I'm gonna take your we're of curly brackets.

00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:26.980
And then I said contacts that's available that we have That's just to display that in the

00:02:26.980 --> 00:02:31.030
form off Jason Jason in the building pipe that one works.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:34.450
Whatever the object is there into Jason string.

00:02:34.450 --> 00:02:36.070
So if you go back to the browser,

00:02:36.070 --> 00:02:38.060
you would still see the previous details.

00:02:38.060 --> 00:02:44.270
That's because our at component HTML currently displays PBY contact tweeted.

00:02:44.270 --> 00:02:46.110
So let me commend the same.

00:02:46.110 --> 00:02:48.620
And then he pulled our new component,

00:02:48.620 --> 00:02:51.600
which is PB cash contact list,

00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:52.840
as a new tack.

00:02:52.840 --> 00:02:54.860
So that's include that at the time.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:55.660
Save it.

00:02:55.660 --> 00:02:57.380
And then I go back to the browser.

00:02:57.380 --> 00:02:59.520
I should see a list of contacts,

00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.730
and you can see that the context waiting some i d one toe i d 10 until if I want the second

00:03:06.730 --> 00:03:07.510
page details.

00:03:07.510 --> 00:03:12.970
I can go back over here to my competent TS and then supply the page number as that's a

00:03:12.970 --> 00:03:13.570
three.

00:03:13.570 --> 00:03:14.610
Save it.

00:03:14.610 --> 00:03:15.770
When I go back here,

00:03:15.770 --> 00:03:19.830
I should see a new set of contacts from 21 to Turkey,

00:03:19.830 --> 00:03:22.200
which is supposed to be a page number three.

00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.850
So let's use this now on display the view context.

00:03:26.850 --> 00:03:29.020
So let's go back to,

00:03:29.020 --> 00:03:29.360
Of course,

00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.760
we want police that this two page number one RB Tony would have to supply that because that

00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:36.870
great we get the first phase details any of it.

00:03:36.870 --> 00:03:43.180
Let's go to the html on you can now display at least off contacts that they had three first

00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:46.510
and say that list off all contacts.

00:03:46.510 --> 00:03:49.760
That's what I had,

00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:55.750
Charlie in order to look through and get all the contacts one by one so we can print the

00:03:55.750 --> 00:04:00.010
details of the same angular provide something called directors.

00:04:00.010 --> 00:04:02.710
So let's visit angular documentation for the same.

00:04:02.710 --> 00:04:06.190
So let's goto angular that Are you Andi?

00:04:06.190 --> 00:04:07.650
Go to the docks.

00:04:07.650 --> 00:04:13.440
There is an A p a section on in the list off types we can select directive.

00:04:13.440 --> 00:04:16.500
As you can see that there are a lot of common directives,

00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:18.790
form related activities and so on.

00:04:18.790 --> 00:04:22.320
So the one that we're looking at is what's called N G.

00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:24.390
Far off the engine.

00:04:24.390 --> 00:04:25.940
Four of directive are losers.

00:04:25.940 --> 00:04:31.280
Toe looked through a collection that we have on observable off collections,

00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.230
and then we can access the unusual elements of the collection.

00:04:35.230 --> 00:04:36.640
This is pretty useful.

00:04:36.640 --> 00:04:38.800
Let's go and check how this can be used.

00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:44.600
Now let's use a deal that is supposed to be repeated for every context that we have to do

00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:46.380
that will take your star.

00:04:46.380 --> 00:04:48.220
N G four equals two,

00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:54.320
and we have to given expression Expression will be like let see off contacts.

00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:54.990
Now,

00:04:54.990 --> 00:04:58.540
contacts is the member variable in our TS Here.

00:04:58.540 --> 00:05:04.410
This is a member reliable and we want toe Get one single contact on Name it as see.

00:05:04.410 --> 00:05:05.230
So now,

00:05:05.230 --> 00:05:06.510
if you can think off,

00:05:06.510 --> 00:05:10.900
see is one contact I can display the details of that See here,

00:05:10.900 --> 00:05:12.000
for example,

00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:14.050
see quite fully.

00:05:14.050 --> 00:05:15.730
So if you go back to the closer,

00:05:15.730 --> 00:05:19.800
you should see all of them displayed in the form of full names.

00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:20.370
All right,

00:05:20.370 --> 00:05:23.970
so this is how we can actually group over.

00:05:23.970 --> 00:05:24.640
And Ari,

00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:28.470
in case if this Eric grows automatically,

00:05:28.470 --> 00:05:29.590
this is also gonna grow.

00:05:29.590 --> 00:05:30.310
For example,

00:05:30.310 --> 00:05:32.880
let's put apartment here saying that,

00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.180
say,

00:05:33.180 --> 00:05:37.340
important for Bt and our treaty and family on.

00:05:37.340 --> 00:05:43.840
Then we'll say your Lord more the talent click event handler for the same called Lord board

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:43.840
.

00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:44.470
And of course,

00:05:44.470 --> 00:05:46.490
we don't have this function that's gonna give another.

00:05:46.490 --> 00:05:47.600
That's save it.

00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.710
Go back over here.

00:05:48.710 --> 00:05:51.270
That's at a function for normal,

00:05:51.270 --> 00:05:54.260
which is supposed to incriminate the page number.

00:05:54.260 --> 00:06:00.040
And we don't have the page number it solitary variable called Asian Off number five,

00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.890
initially to one onda,

00:06:02.890 --> 00:06:07.710
we have to implement that page number will say this start occasional plus plus.

00:06:07.710 --> 00:06:09.940
Now we need to supply this page.

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:13.450
Numb toe the service Don't get all contact function.

00:06:13.450 --> 00:06:19.600
So we said this start service Don't get all contact on this start page number is the

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:23.060
variable that we want to supply to the subscript function.

00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:25.290
We will supply callback,

00:06:25.290 --> 00:06:27.150
which receives the data which is ah,

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:30.220
corresponding a day off contents.

00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:36.780
We have toe contact innate toe this existing addict and this can be done in different base

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:36.780
.

00:06:36.780 --> 00:06:44.210
One of the way to do is start contents equals toe annuity that consists off all the values

00:06:44.210 --> 00:06:46.280
from distort contacts,

00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.690
as with us,

00:06:47.690 --> 00:06:49.990
the values from data.

00:06:49.990 --> 00:06:53.270
So this is called spread operator in year six.

00:06:53.270 --> 00:06:58.250
So it's actually going to spread on the values from contact and then spread all the value

00:06:58.250 --> 00:07:00.590
from data becomes a new away.

00:07:00.590 --> 00:07:04.950
And that is a Centobie start contact you if I save this core now.

00:07:04.950 --> 00:07:07.420
And if you go back to the browser,

00:07:07.420 --> 00:07:08.630
So let's have a look at that.

00:07:08.630 --> 00:07:11.860
We get the first to turn off and when I click on Lord More,

00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:14.560
you can see that 10 more is loaded.

00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:16.280
And every time I click on this,

00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:18.740
you're going to get 10 more each time.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:22.700
So in order to beautify the same thing now let's go back over here.

00:07:22.700 --> 00:07:24.360
Instead of just displaying this,

00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:29.620
I can probably display the image of the person name of the person on Probably City from

00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:32.210
where the person is coming from.

00:07:32.210 --> 00:07:34.960
So let's have some CSS so concern.

00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.890
The end up with what's called list group on that list group is going to contain this group

00:07:41.890 --> 00:07:42.480
items,

00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:46.590
so that's out of your class equals toe list Group item.

00:07:46.590 --> 00:07:55.860
I'm probably I want to have a role with two columns that states rule with a called SM four

00:07:55.860 --> 00:08:02.370
that for the image plus called S them age for the remaining piece of data the 1st 1 is

00:08:02.370 --> 00:08:05.190
supposed to contain and give each That's our image,

00:08:05.190 --> 00:08:08.940
death and the image.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:13.620
Doug is going to consist off the SRC coming from Cedar Picture.

00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.020
But if you remember,

00:08:15.020 --> 00:08:19.730
the cedar picture is supposed to be an expression so we can see that it's an expression by

00:08:19.730 --> 00:08:21.730
adding a squared back into the SRC.

00:08:21.730 --> 00:08:22.570
Attribute.

00:08:22.570 --> 00:08:23.560
So that's a picture.

00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:24.100
No,

00:08:24.100 --> 00:08:25.910
you can also give us size.

00:08:25.910 --> 00:08:29.580
Let's give a strain of hide for example,

00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:30.120
off,

00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:35.690
let's say 100 pixel of 1 50 picture and that should be good enough.

00:08:35.690 --> 00:08:39.710
And this is a place where I want to display the names of the persons.

00:08:39.710 --> 00:08:45.640
Let's have a head for which consists off see but full me on.

00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:55.580
And we're also aware the paragraph which consists off Cedar City and see that state save it

00:08:55.580 --> 00:08:55.580
.

00:08:55.580 --> 00:09:00.500
Let's go back to the Rosa on DSI that the data is despaired nicely.
