00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.900
So in this morning,

00:00:00.900 --> 00:00:06.230
let's say how to receive the round parameters and then get the details off that particular

00:00:06.230 --> 00:00:07.130
contact person.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:08.160
And for this,

00:00:08.160 --> 00:00:10.080
we have to make itself a service.

00:00:10.080 --> 00:00:16.990
Brought it by angular rotor module called as activated wrote so we can declare a variable

00:00:16.990 --> 00:00:17.310
Say,

00:00:17.310 --> 00:00:18.080
for example,

00:00:18.080 --> 00:00:24.910
private after a rated about off type activated round.

00:00:24.910 --> 00:00:29.250
So the variable names can be anything but general tendency is that you keep the same name

00:00:29.250 --> 00:00:31.990
of the class name with a lower gets cost later.

00:00:31.990 --> 00:00:35.850
This now has access toe on the road parameters.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:38.000
We can make use of that in the image.

00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.440
So now we can say here that this start activated outdoor firms,

00:00:42.440 --> 00:00:45.960
which is an observable to which you can subscribe.

00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.360
And now you have access to all the unusual para meters.

00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:56.110
Let's say forums data on now using that term state are we would like to probably make a

00:00:56.110 --> 00:00:57.070
request to this one.

00:00:57.070 --> 00:01:03.650
So I'm gonna cut this from here and paged over here instead of 45 where we want supply is

00:01:03.650 --> 00:01:05.960
off.

00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:10.330
I'd so that we get the idea and nowhere is this idea coming from.

00:01:10.330 --> 00:01:12.350
If you look at this ABT modeled ears.

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:14.630
We defined the variable called Idee here.

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.520
So this is the variable that we're trying to access from the barometer state.

00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:23.050
So if I save this number here and then go back to the browser on,

00:01:23.050 --> 00:01:26.800
we have access to contact details slash one.

00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:31.710
So if I go to the contact list and I click on the second contact,

00:01:31.710 --> 00:01:36.800
you see that we're supplying to here and we're also getting the details of that person.

00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:40.760
So if I goto someone else and then get the evidence,

00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:43.350
I'm able to access that particular details Also,

00:01:43.350 --> 00:01:48.700
a couple off changes we will make your because we see that there are a lot of errors that

00:01:48.700 --> 00:01:49.410
is coming up.

00:01:49.410 --> 00:01:52.850
And that's mainly because off the slash non here.

00:01:52.850 --> 00:01:53.360
Now,

00:01:53.360 --> 00:01:55.560
if I have some deformed picture,

00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:58.040
that would be fantastic,

00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:01.290
so we can assign a different picture.

00:02:01.290 --> 00:02:06.080
You are like this so we can go to over Martin on.

00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.020
We have this conduct tortillas.

00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.860
There is a picture which is optional,

00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:16.160
and I can also assign a string here which is supposed to be slashed,

00:02:16.160 --> 00:02:18.870
a sex slash in majors,

00:02:18.870 --> 00:02:26.210
and then I can say you're off flight dot PNG Andi that should give us a default profile

00:02:26.210 --> 00:02:26.780
picture.

00:02:26.780 --> 00:02:28.590
Now if you go back to the closer,

00:02:28.590 --> 00:02:30.390
we see that we don't have an editor.

00:02:30.390 --> 00:02:35.510
And that's because I do have a picture called assets Images profile that PNG.

00:02:35.510 --> 00:02:39.620
So if you go back toe SRC and sits images,

00:02:39.620 --> 00:02:41.290
you can see I have this provider,

00:02:41.290 --> 00:02:43.350
the engine which can be used in the future.

00:02:43.350 --> 00:02:46.990
One last thing that we will fix is the size off.

00:02:46.990 --> 00:02:48.830
This is probably too big,

00:02:48.830 --> 00:02:53.780
so I want O district US 200 pixel installed on an effective excel.

00:02:53.780 --> 00:02:57.070
So we go the contact list html on.

00:02:57.070 --> 00:02:59.630
We have you in here something like 1 50 pixel.

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:03.660
Let's reduce the tow 100 pixel and that should be fine.

00:03:03.660 --> 00:03:08.270
One last thing is that this one doesn't look like a clickable icon,

00:03:08.270 --> 00:03:11.790
but it is explicable one because of all rotor linker.

00:03:11.790 --> 00:03:20.940
We can add a bit of style here so you can say style equals toe concert colon pointer,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:23.400
and that makes it look like a clickable icon.

00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:27.570
You can see that I get a fingertip so I can take on that person when I get the details of

00:03:27.570 --> 00:03:28.190
the same thing
