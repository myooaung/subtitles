00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.160
So our application Now this place a list off contacts or I can click on a particular

00:00:07.160 --> 00:00:08.560
contact person toe you.

00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:11.380
The details are If I want to delete,

00:00:11.380 --> 00:00:12.750
I can click on the delete.

00:00:12.750 --> 00:00:14.090
I get a pop up.

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:16.040
I can say Okay to be cancelled.

00:00:16.040 --> 00:00:16.350
Toe.

00:00:16.350 --> 00:00:16.950
Stay back.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:20.350
Suppose if you want to add a new conduct,

00:00:20.350 --> 00:00:22.650
then we have to work with forms.

00:00:22.650 --> 00:00:26.550
An annular began work with forms in two ways.

00:00:26.550 --> 00:00:28.490
One is called template driven forms.

00:00:28.490 --> 00:00:30.550
Another is called reactive forms.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:32.310
In this particular video,

00:00:32.310 --> 00:00:34.450
we will be working with template to inform.

00:00:34.450 --> 00:00:35.800
First,

00:00:35.800 --> 00:00:41.480
let's have a new component and poured a teacher so that I can get ahead html form to add a

00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.250
new contact.

00:00:42.250 --> 00:00:46.450
So I go to the command prompt.

00:00:46.450 --> 00:00:49.050
Make sure that I'm in the working directory.

00:00:49.050 --> 00:00:55.350
Are that n g generated component computers slash contact.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:57.270
If you don't want toe,

00:00:57.270 --> 00:00:58.400
have the expect.

00:00:58.400 --> 00:01:02.030
With this technique was Toe Falls Onda.

00:01:02.030 --> 00:01:08.370
We can get it up the before graphics and other new graphics like That's Perfect equals Toe

00:01:08.370 --> 00:01:09.750
BB for phone book.

00:01:09.750 --> 00:01:19.420
Other careers three files a CSS and HTML on a T s fight on so it has updated are more

00:01:19.420 --> 00:01:20.250
duties.

00:01:20.250 --> 00:01:27.950
So let's go to the core and open the SRC app components,

00:01:27.950 --> 00:01:33.550
and we have your honor conduct our conduct component its demon.

00:01:33.550 --> 00:01:38.040
So if you want our contact form toe appear over here,

00:01:38.040 --> 00:01:39.990
we'll probably a sidebar button.

00:01:39.990 --> 00:01:43.450
Let's go to the state of our complement each to Yemen.

00:01:43.450 --> 00:01:57.270
Copy this link based it that's blowing something leg that's contact with public on the new

00:01:57.270 --> 00:01:57.750
conduct.

00:01:57.750 --> 00:02:04.050
So we get the button here.

00:02:04.050 --> 00:02:04.520
But of course,

00:02:04.520 --> 00:02:05.560
when I click on that,

00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:10.520
we get an editor saying that I contact is not a value route.

00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.500
So we have to go to our at modern ideas.

00:02:13.500 --> 00:02:20.800
We have to define a new route so that when But I that's contact is encounter.

00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:27.950
A new component called our conduct component is placed on the its demon Paige.

00:02:27.950 --> 00:02:30.440
If you go here now and it's very fresh,

00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:34.110
if I click on this our new contact,

00:02:34.110 --> 00:02:36.980
you see that we get HTML page here.

00:02:36.980 --> 00:02:38.070
Of course,

00:02:38.070 --> 00:02:40.950
in order to make this as a valid HTML,

00:02:40.950 --> 00:02:44.370
let's go and at some rich human form.

00:02:44.370 --> 00:02:45.370
So goto this.

00:02:45.370 --> 00:02:50.650
Get it up this history and your contact.

00:02:50.650 --> 00:02:56.130
Let's put a simple HTML form.

00:02:56.130 --> 00:02:58.380
I'm going to use their form dot form.

00:02:58.380 --> 00:03:01.880
That's gonna be our bootstrap CSS class.

00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:04.310
We don't need action here because we're not submitting.

00:03:04.310 --> 00:03:06.140
This year s are over 30 source,

00:03:06.140 --> 00:03:11.640
but we would like to have a label and it takes part for each of the properties.

00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:20.830
Let's have a deal with form groups and then consisting off label plus on input with form

00:03:20.830 --> 00:03:21.460
control.

00:03:21.460 --> 00:03:23.180
As a class,

00:03:23.180 --> 00:03:29.390
the label will have first name as the caption on the input text box is supposed to be for

00:03:29.390 --> 00:03:30.250
the first name.

00:03:30.250 --> 00:03:35.690
The actor good form should correspond to the idea of this particular input box so I can

00:03:35.690 --> 00:03:37.150
give you first name.

00:03:37.150 --> 00:03:38.750
I don't have an idea.

00:03:38.750 --> 00:03:41.040
Let's give it an ID equals two first me.

00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:41.380
Now,

00:03:41.380 --> 00:03:45.950
the purpose behind this is when I go back to the its female form.

00:03:45.950 --> 00:03:47.070
You see,

00:03:47.070 --> 00:03:49.020
I can click on this label on.

00:03:49.020 --> 00:03:50.790
The cursor appears over here.

00:03:50.790 --> 00:03:55.950
So I get if I do not have this for save it.

00:03:55.950 --> 00:04:00.630
Go back over here and you can see I can click on this,

00:04:00.630 --> 00:04:01.920
But nothing happened.

00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:04.140
It doesn't transfer the control over here.

00:04:04.140 --> 00:04:07.400
So by adding a four equals toe first me,

00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:12.490
You clicking on this label will bring the focus on this particular textbooks it's given

00:04:12.490 --> 00:04:13.030
under one.

00:04:13.030 --> 00:04:13.950
So I'm no,

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:15.190
Make some room more.

00:04:15.190 --> 00:04:15.750
Here,

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:19.450
make a copy off this for last name.

00:04:19.450 --> 00:04:25.050
This is gonna be a label called last name.

00:04:25.050 --> 00:04:30.550
Andi should match whatever that be a referencing over here.

00:04:30.550 --> 00:04:34.050
And we have two text boxes.

00:04:34.050 --> 00:04:35.250
First name and last name.

00:04:35.250 --> 00:04:36.870
Now,

00:04:36.870 --> 00:04:39.450
the next one probably would be gender.

00:04:39.450 --> 00:04:42.530
So I'm gonna copy this on Pieced.

00:04:42.530 --> 00:04:44.960
But this time I want to have a really wouldn.

00:04:44.960 --> 00:04:48.430
So this is gonna be good input.

00:04:48.430 --> 00:04:50.150
Because to video,

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.150
we have to give a common name for both of them that is given as gender.

00:04:55.150 --> 00:04:58.680
This is not really require i d.

00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.630
That's not required.

00:04:59.630 --> 00:05:01.210
I can get it up.

00:05:01.210 --> 00:05:04.370
This 80 aspirin value equals school made.

00:05:04.370 --> 00:05:05.900
Andi,

00:05:05.900 --> 00:05:07.350
I can say here,

00:05:07.350 --> 00:05:19.230
label type your main slash labour on the same thing.

00:05:19.230 --> 00:05:22.370
I'm gonna coffee based make a another really?

00:05:22.370 --> 00:05:23.500
With the same name.

00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:25.580
The value would be female.

00:05:25.580 --> 00:05:26.920
And of course,

00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:30.000
the caption to be displayed also would be female.

00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.650
So if I save this and go back,

00:05:31.650 --> 00:05:36.330
you should see that there is a really button that says male or female.

00:05:36.330 --> 00:05:38.300
So I click on this that's selected.

00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:39.120
I click on this,

00:05:39.120 --> 00:05:40.850
another really button selected.

00:05:40.850 --> 00:05:49.190
So let me complete the form by adding one set off do slash deal for each of the contact

00:05:49.190 --> 00:05:50.050
details.

00:05:50.050 --> 00:05:54.330
So no,

00:05:54.330 --> 00:05:59.440
I've added one field for each one of them and it had a submarine Britain,

00:05:59.440 --> 00:06:10.390
below the picture so good on your at a the median bt and primary.

00:06:10.390 --> 00:06:14.150
I will call this us soon.

00:06:14.150 --> 00:06:23.620
So we do have a important toe at as a angular a loose the form elements to be associated

00:06:23.620 --> 00:06:24.990
with model later.

00:06:24.990 --> 00:06:26.000
For example,

00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.970
if I have a variable called first name here,

00:06:29.970 --> 00:06:34.250
I can associate that first name with this particular textbooks.

00:06:34.250 --> 00:06:38.580
Now this can be done in either one were binding or two were by me.

00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:43.890
Wonder bending is where we can just go and say value equals toe something.

00:06:43.890 --> 00:06:44.660
For example,

00:06:44.660 --> 00:06:54.240
if I say here first name off spring equals toe that you don't And if I want this value to

00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:56.430
be associated with this text box,

00:06:56.430 --> 00:07:02.130
I can always come here and say value equals toe first name off course.

00:07:02.130 --> 00:07:04.040
If this is an expression,

00:07:04.040 --> 00:07:07.610
this can be given in two ways either with a double curly bracket.

00:07:07.610 --> 00:07:13.160
Or I can simply say that this is a an expression by adding a square bracket.

00:07:13.160 --> 00:07:14.760
If you go back to the browser now,

00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:18.170
you can see that the first name is changed toe.

00:07:18.170 --> 00:07:20.660
We know because the value is coming from here.

00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:23.680
But if I want to see what's the value off the model later,

00:07:23.680 --> 00:07:29.290
when I make the changes to the text box that's going on a paragraph where I use a double

00:07:29.290 --> 00:07:31.510
curly bracket first name,

00:07:31.510 --> 00:07:37.110
which is the modern reader on then if you go back here and then check it shows here,

00:07:37.110 --> 00:07:40.210
we know that that's coming from the actual modern.

00:07:40.210 --> 00:07:42.410
So also is this one.

00:07:42.410 --> 00:07:43.940
But it between this to say,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:44.610
Come on,

00:07:44.610 --> 00:07:46.260
this is unchanged.

00:07:46.260 --> 00:07:48.350
That's because it's a one reminding meeting.

00:07:48.350 --> 00:07:53.230
The value of the modern data has been associated with in a one way style.

00:07:53.230 --> 00:07:55.600
So if you make the changes in the text box,

00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.230
it is not reflected in the actual model.

00:07:58.230 --> 00:07:59.780
So to do so,

00:07:59.780 --> 00:08:02.930
we can add one called engine modern.

00:08:02.930 --> 00:08:05.450
So the way you can specify is you.

00:08:05.450 --> 00:08:11.420
Can you the squared wreckage because an expression and it is also associated with their on

00:08:11.420 --> 00:08:12.750
key up event.

00:08:12.750 --> 00:08:17.550
So we're gonna die pure N G model and then assigned the variable,

00:08:17.550 --> 00:08:18.750
which is trust me,

00:08:18.750 --> 00:08:21.510
this causes a problem,

00:08:21.510 --> 00:08:23.740
as you can see that it's already showing me another.

00:08:23.740 --> 00:08:27.130
That engine model cannot be used directly like this.

00:08:27.130 --> 00:08:28.910
It has got some pretty with it.

00:08:28.910 --> 00:08:30.280
So if you go back to the browser,

00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.480
you can see that on the console.

00:08:32.480 --> 00:08:34.350
I must be getting a few others.

00:08:34.350 --> 00:08:38.380
And the reason for this is if you want to use engine model,

00:08:38.380 --> 00:08:41.230
you have to work with another model.

00:08:41.230 --> 00:08:42.550
Caldas forms model.

00:08:42.550 --> 00:08:54.420
So we got our model ts and then first we say import from at angular slash forms and what we

00:08:54.420 --> 00:09:00.720
want to import is something our forms modern and this forms module has to be added to our

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:01.870
import section.

00:09:01.870 --> 00:09:03.620
Let's go at it over here,

00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:05.250
and this is the first step.

00:09:05.250 --> 00:09:08.750
The second step is whenever you're using engine model,

00:09:08.750 --> 00:09:13.950
this particular field must have a name of property.

00:09:13.950 --> 00:09:15.700
It can be any value,

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:18.130
but regionally view the same name as the modern name.

00:09:18.130 --> 00:09:18.510
So,

00:09:18.510 --> 00:09:21.660
given her first name and I go back to the browser,

00:09:21.660 --> 00:09:24.580
you should see that it's showing the value we know,

00:09:24.580 --> 00:09:25.610
coming from the modern.

00:09:25.610 --> 00:09:27.920
The same thing is coming over here.

00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:29.610
But if I start raising,

00:09:29.610 --> 00:09:34.960
you should see that it's also changing in this because now the text box is associate it

00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.470
with the modern in a two way binding style.

00:09:37.470 --> 00:09:39.270
So if changes toe come on,

00:09:39.270 --> 00:09:41.850
you can see that the model is also getting changed.

00:09:41.850 --> 00:09:42.930
Now,

00:09:42.930 --> 00:09:46.530
what we will do is we have to repeat the same thing for each off this.

00:09:46.530 --> 00:09:50.850
But instead of declaring one variable for each off the members,

00:09:50.850 --> 00:09:52.090
I can as well cleared,

00:09:52.090 --> 00:09:58.350
available off contract type and initialized this start contact it goes toe new contract.

00:09:58.350 --> 00:10:06.870
Let's go back here and say that the model corresponds toe contract dot First name on.

00:10:06.870 --> 00:10:10.970
That's because the modern data this is a property of that now.

00:10:10.970 --> 00:10:14.420
So we can now give here name equals toe.

00:10:14.420 --> 00:10:26.340
Last name N g model equals two conduct dot last year and likewise I may also want to give

00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.310
for this one.

00:10:27.310 --> 00:10:29.190
Now I know that this is the radio button.

00:10:29.190 --> 00:10:32.880
We already have given a name property for days.

00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:38.850
All that we have to do is tow associate an n g murder equals toe gender for both of them.

00:10:38.850 --> 00:10:41.970
So I'm gonna pace this over here as well.

00:10:41.970 --> 00:10:45.990
Here on this is gonna be gender and put the places you know,

00:10:45.990 --> 00:10:49.480
since the default value for contact our gender is male.

00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:52.190
If I save it and if I go back to the browser,

00:10:52.190 --> 00:10:55.850
I should see that mail is already selected.

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:56.530
Of course,

00:10:56.530 --> 00:10:59.330
if I select this female than the models,

00:10:59.330 --> 00:11:01.240
gender results changed to female.

00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:05.050
Now let me at the same thing for each of these text boxes.

00:11:05.050 --> 00:11:07.190
And one last thing is that tells you,

00:11:07.190 --> 00:11:10.100
get it up this first because we don't have any of them.

00:11:10.100 --> 00:11:13.600
But instead we can display contact.

00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:17.180
But that's an object you have displayed in a Jason form it.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:20.110
Let's just had a fight with Jason toe.

00:11:20.110 --> 00:11:24.050
See the content off that they go back to the brother and have a look at that.

00:11:24.050 --> 00:11:26.980
It's displaying an empty contact object,

00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:29.850
which has a gender and picture by default.

00:11:29.850 --> 00:11:32.660
But if I start adding in the other details,

00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:34.650
you can see that it's adding forced me.

00:11:34.650 --> 00:11:37.310
Last name gender is already there.

00:11:37.310 --> 00:11:38.430
So I take here.

00:11:38.430 --> 00:11:40.450
We know that you know Burke with an email,

00:11:40.450 --> 00:11:43.030
and that's added and so on and so forth again.

00:11:43.030 --> 00:12:01.230
Just verify that by adding each of the fields So you can see now that the data object

00:12:01.230 --> 00:12:07.400
consists off the values from the text box on that we have to do now is toe write a function

00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.590
that can handle the are functionality.

00:12:10.590 --> 00:12:11.440
To do that,

00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:12.750
let's go back to the core.

00:12:12.750 --> 00:12:16.240
We got the ad contact component DS.

00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:20.370
It's clear a function called at contact Onda.

00:12:20.370 --> 00:12:26.110
We have this contact object we want toe added over existing repository.

00:12:26.110 --> 00:12:27.100
To do that,

00:12:27.100 --> 00:12:32.600
we will inject the service which is foreign books arteries.

00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.530
Once we got the service,

00:12:34.530 --> 00:12:40.250
we can see here that this start service start our new contact.

00:12:40.250 --> 00:12:42.130
It needs a contact object,

00:12:42.130 --> 00:12:46.020
which is nothing but this got contact the return belly off.

00:12:46.020 --> 00:12:51.920
Our new contact is an observable and will be subscribe were to supply a call back and the

00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.050
callback gets the identity contact object and we can say what we want to do with that.

00:12:57.050 --> 00:13:03.210
So maybe temporally I can just display the idea off that on the console by piping consular

00:13:03.210 --> 00:13:13.150
law and you contact with Ivy plus contractor i d.

00:13:13.150 --> 00:13:14.050
Now,

00:13:14.050 --> 00:13:18.170
after adding I might be interested toe Go to the page,

00:13:18.170 --> 00:13:19.780
which displays the details.

00:13:19.780 --> 00:13:26.720
So for which we might want to use one more service this time rotor service,

00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.460
off type called Shelter.

00:13:28.460 --> 00:13:30.720
And once you have this rotor,

00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:34.350
we can now say this starter motor don't navigate.

00:13:34.350 --> 00:13:38.940
And then we supply the part where we want to go on the party's card.

00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:44.950
Contact details along with the newly generated idea which is contact that I d.

00:13:44.950 --> 00:13:47.170
And they should take the control toe.

00:13:47.170 --> 00:13:49.720
The contact details page displaying the details.

00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:50.650
Contact person.

00:13:50.650 --> 00:13:55.760
So I saved this and call this function on the click off this particular partner.

00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:57.150
So let's go to the button.

00:13:57.150 --> 00:14:00.920
The click event.

00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:05.120
He quotes toe the function,

00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:06.250
add conduct.

00:14:06.250 --> 00:14:10.270
So I say this to go back to the browser.

00:14:10.270 --> 00:14:38.100
I hear my feet is and like the Abberton on once we at this we should see that the details

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.950
have been added successfully to the press 10 point
