00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.470
No,

00:00:00.470 --> 00:00:06.450
the bill seen how the routing works on How can we switch between different components by

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:07.740
using a route hurling?

00:00:07.740 --> 00:00:13.640
Let's have a look at one more feature were programmatically we can navigate to a different

00:00:13.640 --> 00:00:14.550
view as well.

00:00:14.550 --> 00:00:15.590
For example,

00:00:15.590 --> 00:00:18.410
if I take on this person and I get the D days,

00:00:18.410 --> 00:00:19.700
that's what we want to provide.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.250
A delete put in here.

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:22.140
Onda.

00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:23.300
When I click on the village,

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:24.840
I want to be asked.

00:00:24.840 --> 00:00:26.540
Are you sure you want to believe this?

00:00:26.540 --> 00:00:28.200
And if the answer is yes,

00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.270
I should delete this.

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:31.090
But since the data gets deleted,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:32.930
I do not want to be here.

00:00:32.930 --> 00:00:38.090
But instead I would like to go back to the contact list where I can view are delete more

00:00:38.090 --> 00:00:38.550
people.

00:00:38.550 --> 00:00:42.780
I can also provide a deal adoption here itself so I can kick on this.

00:00:42.780 --> 00:00:44.730
And the same thing should happen off course,

00:00:44.730 --> 00:00:48.440
in which case I don't have any for the redirection toe happen.

00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:49.490
But first,

00:00:49.490 --> 00:00:53.900
let's go and see that we can provide a delete button from here to do that.

00:00:53.900 --> 00:00:59.040
Let's go to the contact details Component Command V or control,

00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.740
be contact details.

00:01:00.740 --> 00:01:01.390
Yes,

00:01:01.390 --> 00:01:03.880
we're gonna provide a delete functionality here.

00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:04.740
So that's holidays.

00:01:04.740 --> 00:01:07.180
Delete contact Onda.

00:01:07.180 --> 00:01:09.970
Whatever the contact that is currently being displayed,

00:01:09.970 --> 00:01:11.450
people take to do the same thing.

00:01:11.450 --> 00:01:12.850
Now forties.

00:01:12.850 --> 00:01:18.600
We want to make it off this salaries with the distorts our restart delete contact.

00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:20.000
And that takes an idea.

00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.910
The perimeter so will supply this contacts.

00:01:22.910 --> 00:01:26.130
I'll be so if they start contact our i.

00:01:26.130 --> 00:01:26.550
D.

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:27.390
Onda.

00:01:27.390 --> 00:01:33.320
This Retton's an observable on when the subscription is complete.

00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:39.240
We would like to do something such that the current view is taken off on another view is

00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:40.670
placed in the route or out late.

00:01:40.670 --> 00:01:43.170
This can be done by using another service,

00:01:43.170 --> 00:01:47.170
probably better after Madi and this is called as a router.

00:01:47.170 --> 00:01:52.910
So we're gonna provide here a variable five it around her off type throughout.

00:01:52.910 --> 00:02:00.560
And that's important here and now this variable has access to your function called navigate

00:02:00.560 --> 00:02:04.190
within distort router Don't navigate.

00:02:04.190 --> 00:02:11.610
We have to supply a day off all the part parts in our get it very simple with a contact

00:02:11.610 --> 00:02:12.180
list.

00:02:12.180 --> 00:02:16.680
That's where we would like to go on giving this takes any road para middle.

00:02:16.680 --> 00:02:19.320
We could have supplied that as some variables here,

00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:23.490
as well the only thing that we have to do now is to provide a part in for place.

00:02:23.490 --> 00:02:29.160
Let's go to the extreme and corresponding to this probably off towards somewhere here I can

00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:33.770
see for $10 median BT in danger.

00:02:33.770 --> 00:02:36.370
So because it's a delete button,

00:02:36.370 --> 00:02:43.820
I can also provide hear a click event handler equals toe delete contact function.

00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:46.620
One last thing that we want to provide here is toe.

00:02:46.620 --> 00:02:47.560
Ask the user.

00:02:47.560 --> 00:02:49.030
Are you sure you want to delete?

00:02:49.030 --> 00:02:50.740
And we say here by using,

00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.170
if not conform?

00:02:53.170 --> 00:02:54.180
Confirmed by the way,

00:02:54.180 --> 00:02:58.630
is a window function so we can see your Are you shoud on?

00:02:58.630 --> 00:03:00.340
If the user says no,

00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:03.170
we're going to just return from this particular place.

00:03:03.170 --> 00:03:04.820
If they use their says Yes,

00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:05.900
this is gonna go.

00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:06.520
If they use this,

00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.100
there's no it's just returning of it from here itself.

00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:10.320
So it saved this.

00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:11.650
Go back to the browser.

00:03:11.650 --> 00:03:14.850
Now we have a A button to village.

00:03:14.850 --> 00:03:15.860
So if I click on this,

00:03:15.860 --> 00:03:17.370
it's gonna ask me Are you sure?

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:18.460
I say cancel.

00:03:18.460 --> 00:03:19.550
I'm gonna stay back.

00:03:19.550 --> 00:03:22.320
If I say village and I say OK,

00:03:22.320 --> 00:03:24.550
now you can see that it's deleted on.

00:03:24.550 --> 00:03:27.450
I'm also navigated toe contact list
