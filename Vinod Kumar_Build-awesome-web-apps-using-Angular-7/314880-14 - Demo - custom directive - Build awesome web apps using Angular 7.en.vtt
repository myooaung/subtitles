00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.790
We can also create our own custom directors to understand the same That's create a

00:00:05.790 --> 00:00:07.650
component on a direct you.

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:13.550
So we go back to the blind drunk will take here n g genetic component.

00:00:13.550 --> 00:00:19.240
But this time it's gonna be a custom do demo,

00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:23.650
and we'll also create a new directive.

00:00:23.650 --> 00:00:26.230
N g g d.

00:00:26.230 --> 00:00:27.150
For directive.

00:00:27.150 --> 00:00:32.980
Oregon activated Generated Directive and I can say at this time a new folder called If

00:00:32.980 --> 00:00:41.010
Pills Slash Let's call it US box when I pressed Enter is gonna gender it only a es file

00:00:41.010 --> 00:00:45.650
because this is not going to contain any HTML or CSS,

00:00:45.650 --> 00:00:47.140
and it has updated.

00:00:47.140 --> 00:00:50.400
The majority is in the declaration section on.

00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:57.900
So let's go back to our APP component h Demon and Change.

00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:03.350
This Engy switched the Moto customs.

00:01:03.350 --> 00:01:15.210
Did it do Devil slash up custom directive demo and it opened the browser and I say local

00:01:15.210 --> 00:01:16.570
was for Cordoba zero.

00:01:16.570 --> 00:01:20.900
You should see it is custom directive Demo works on.

00:01:20.900 --> 00:01:29.750
What we'll do is we'll go to that new component and are they a bunch off dues that's at

00:01:29.750 --> 00:01:30.950
your do?

00:01:30.950 --> 00:01:32.160
And I said,

00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:36.200
this is a do a lot of paragraph on,

00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:36.560
say,

00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.760
This is a paragraph and lots of our end image.

00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:50.060
SRC equals toe assess slash images slash Goldberg jpg We'll also take their Engy style

00:01:50.060 --> 00:02:01.750
equals toe height 30 p x 150 Now we have these three elements We go back,

00:02:01.750 --> 00:02:03.000
we see this content.

00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:09.460
Let's go to our directive Plus which is boxed are directed RTs on I call this as a box

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:15.250
director because when it is used I want this toe Surround the elements like a box?

00:02:15.250 --> 00:02:15.860
No,

00:02:15.860 --> 00:02:21.670
not the selector here has a square Brakhage at box You can give any name you want here like

00:02:21.670 --> 00:02:22.760
box itself.

00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.140
But Angular suggested you should use some kind of a perfect here so that it doesn't

00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:34.440
conflict with any of the building directives our HTML attributes So the square bracket here

00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:36.920
indicates that reviewed So I didn't leave.

00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:38.890
We've been given a dark at boats,

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:41.480
in which case I could've used it as a CSS class.

00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:47.280
Let's leave that as an attribute so I can go to the HTML here on what I want is I want to

00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.550
see here that this is a box like this.

00:02:50.550 --> 00:02:56.590
The idea of giving it director was an active you'd hear is toe have an access to the actual

00:02:56.590 --> 00:03:00.860
element where it is being used on de control the appearance of the same.

00:03:00.860 --> 00:03:02.230
So to do so.

00:03:02.230 --> 00:03:07.010
First thing is you have tow ask for a dependency called as an element left.

00:03:07.010 --> 00:03:08.870
So we dive your fire,

00:03:08.870 --> 00:03:12.750
it element off type called element breath,

00:03:12.750 --> 00:03:16.150
which is a member off angular course.

00:03:16.150 --> 00:03:17.410
So we got that on.

00:03:17.410 --> 00:03:20.940
All I have to do is tow get the needed element,

00:03:20.940 --> 00:03:26.150
meaning that element on which this particular director has been applied on a place and

00:03:26.150 --> 00:03:32.450
styles to that to do so we use an interface after view in it.

00:03:32.450 --> 00:03:38.840
And we are this missing function which is called GI after viewing it.

00:03:38.840 --> 00:03:39.340
Now,

00:03:39.340 --> 00:03:42.660
here we can access the element inside this on.

00:03:42.660 --> 00:03:45.630
Then add some CIA sister that so I'm going to do this.

00:03:45.630 --> 00:03:46.820
I can say this.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:53.470
Start a limit dot native element dot style and which style we want to actually access.

00:03:53.470 --> 00:03:54.080
For example,

00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:59.150
if I want to provide of border equals two one pixel solid,

00:03:59.150 --> 00:04:01.220
let's sit back on,

00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.190
save this.

00:04:02.190 --> 00:04:03.880
And if you go back to the browser,

00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:08.110
you can see that the deal is now having a box.

00:04:08.110 --> 00:04:11.860
I can apply this on any of these other elements.

00:04:11.860 --> 00:04:12.390
For example,

00:04:12.390 --> 00:04:15.940
I can have your B at Fox on now.

00:04:15.940 --> 00:04:20.400
I should be able to see that the paragraph also has the box.

00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.190
Andi,

00:04:21.190 --> 00:04:23.710
I can go on adding more and more stuff.

00:04:23.710 --> 00:04:24.290
For example,

00:04:24.290 --> 00:04:25.250
like an idea.

00:04:25.250 --> 00:04:26.340
The same thing.

00:04:26.340 --> 00:04:29.550
A couple of times I can say bar death radius.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:31.430
I can just a pure fight.

00:04:31.430 --> 00:04:36.070
Except I can say here Patties off,

00:04:36.070 --> 00:04:45.840
maybe five picks up and maybe a margin also five except save this and go back and we should

00:04:45.840 --> 00:04:48.600
see that the boxes are different now.

00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:55.250
I can also add it to the AMG for want I can say here have parks on it just does the same

00:04:55.250 --> 00:04:56.850
thing for the image Also.

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:00.600
Now I can also control certain other things.

00:05:00.600 --> 00:05:01.280
For example,

00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.050
if I want to supply the color for this box different than this one.

00:05:06.050 --> 00:05:14.680
So this can be done by going to our class Prickly a variable called size which is equals

00:05:14.680 --> 00:05:16.890
toe one pixel by default.

00:05:16.890 --> 00:05:20.170
So I want to replace this one and I have a style here,

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:26.370
which is a solid someone type year type equals two solid on.

00:05:26.370 --> 00:05:30.850
But then I can say your color is equals to black,

00:05:30.850 --> 00:05:33.130
which is the default values on.

00:05:33.130 --> 00:05:39.050
Now I can change this to an expression by removing this using a back court,

00:05:39.050 --> 00:05:42.450
I can use dollars this dot size,

00:05:42.450 --> 00:05:49.490
space dollar this stock type space dollars this start color off course,

00:05:49.490 --> 00:05:49.850
you know,

00:05:49.850 --> 00:05:50.540
changes.

00:05:50.540 --> 00:05:51.760
If I go back to the browser,

00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:52.990
I still see the same thing.

00:05:52.990 --> 00:05:55.090
But if a changing political right here,

00:05:55.090 --> 00:05:57.230
I am going to get a red border.

00:05:57.230 --> 00:06:02.550
What we want to do is to supply these values from the elements here.

00:06:02.550 --> 00:06:09.680
And the way I can do is buy idea decorator for activated input on what this does is now.

00:06:09.680 --> 00:06:17.120
I can supply a property called size from the attribute here so I can add your an expression

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:17.120
.

00:06:17.120 --> 00:06:20.520
Size equals to what is the expression?

00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:26.350
So maybe I can see here three pigs self you can see for the 1st 1 It's a play that Streep

00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:26.930
excel.

00:06:26.930 --> 00:06:28.890
But for the 2nd 1 it is not.

00:06:28.890 --> 00:06:36.440
I can also add add great input for type on after it input for color.

00:06:36.440 --> 00:06:40.130
Now I can use any off this in the element.

00:06:40.130 --> 00:06:40.710
For example,

00:06:40.710 --> 00:06:45.450
I can see your equals two company.

00:06:45.450 --> 00:06:50.750
I can say your size equals to five fixem.

00:06:50.750 --> 00:06:56.450
I can also say here color equals toe.

00:06:56.450 --> 00:06:57.820
See right,

00:06:57.820 --> 00:06:58.750
Save it,

00:06:58.750 --> 00:07:01.750
go back and you can see that it's a red color.

00:07:01.750 --> 00:07:03.730
It's a double border as well s.

00:07:03.730 --> 00:07:04.530
It's a fight,

00:07:04.530 --> 00:07:04.980
big self.

00:07:04.980 --> 00:07:07.590
I can have this to any of this.

00:07:07.590 --> 00:07:09.000
You can see here.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:15.530
Color includes two blow sighs.

00:07:15.530 --> 00:07:21.640
People's too three picks up equal stool death.

00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:34.040
So this way director can be used for modifying the appearance off element,

00:07:34.040 --> 00:07:35.930
which is totally customizable.
