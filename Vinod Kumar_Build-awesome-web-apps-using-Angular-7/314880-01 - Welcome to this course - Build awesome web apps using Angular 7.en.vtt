00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.240
angular is an open source Web application framework have lived by Google and a community

00:00:05.240 --> 00:00:07.550
off individuals and corporations.

00:00:07.550 --> 00:00:11.750
If you're familiar with our heart of angular Jay's rework,

00:00:11.750 --> 00:00:17.450
the new Anglo DreamWorks is a complete related from the same team that build angle urges.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.290
Originally,

00:00:19.290 --> 00:00:21.030
this really it was called angular,

00:00:21.030 --> 00:00:21.450
too.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:28.320
But this led to confusion among developers to gratify the team announced that separate done

00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:31.820
should be used for each frame work with angular jails,

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.540
refering toe,

00:00:32.540 --> 00:00:37.100
the wonder explosions and angular suffering toe worsen store nable.

00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.150
As of this recording,

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:41.650
angular Russian seven is the latest.

00:00:41.650 --> 00:00:45.000
An angular application is down abusing typescript,

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:45.590
which,

00:00:45.590 --> 00:00:49.250
you can say is the most sophisticated video of Charles Strict.

00:00:49.250 --> 00:00:51.100
That's good off us.

00:00:51.100 --> 00:00:56.380
Some of the language regions that are currently not in JavaScript specification on it must

00:00:56.380 --> 00:00:56.850
slipped.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:01:00.330
But since the protests only understand Java skirt,

00:01:00.330 --> 00:01:05.170
the angular Famer comes with a compiler that transforms your types could called into an

00:01:05.170 --> 00:01:06.650
equal in JavaScript core.

00:01:06.650 --> 00:01:09.100
For this angular users,

00:01:09.100 --> 00:01:13.150
right back angular applications are amazingly farce.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:17.450
Major lead you to the concept of single paid applications on SPE.

00:01:17.450 --> 00:01:23.620
This is achieved by using a router model powered by angular which cancel or components

00:01:23.620 --> 00:01:24.350
lazily.

00:01:24.350 --> 00:01:26.250
This is primarily a hands on to,

00:01:26.250 --> 00:01:26.810
of course,

00:01:26.810 --> 00:01:31.590
which means I'll be showing you the application development process step by step from the

00:01:31.590 --> 00:01:32.150
scratch.

00:01:32.150 --> 00:01:38.150
While I'm using a couple of basic examples to make you feel comfortable with the concept,

00:01:38.150 --> 00:01:42.240
I will also be developing a full list for good pipe application toe.

00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:44.560
Demonstrate the major concepts off angular.

00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:44.890
Seven.

00:01:44.890 --> 00:01:49.140
All of the good I have developed in this course is available for you to don't wrote,

00:01:49.140 --> 00:01:54.750
Install and execute that step for doing so are shown in the subsequent lectures.

00:01:54.750 --> 00:01:55.750
However,

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:58.580
if you want to call yourself which I strongly recommend,

00:01:58.580 --> 00:02:03.750
you may do so by typing along with me and pausing the video wherever necessary.

00:02:03.750 --> 00:02:05.730
My name is you know,

00:02:05.730 --> 00:02:07.140
I'm a softer trainer,

00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:12.250
developer consultant with an industry experience off over 20 years.

00:02:12.250 --> 00:02:14.850
I welcome you to this exciting course.

00:02:14.850 --> 00:02:16.730
There are lots of things to learn,

00:02:16.730 --> 00:02:17.950
so let's get started
