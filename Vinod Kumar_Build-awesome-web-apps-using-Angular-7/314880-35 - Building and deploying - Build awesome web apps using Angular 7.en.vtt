00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.140
our phone book application is now ready.

00:00:02.140 --> 00:00:04.980
And let's have a look at the folder that we have,

00:00:04.980 --> 00:00:06.750
so it's on my desktop.

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:11.210
On this is the phone book app and on McElroy Zika Press Space Bar.

00:00:11.210 --> 00:00:13.350
I get information about the directory,

00:00:13.350 --> 00:00:17.750
and you can see that it is 302.4 and be with 10 items.

00:00:17.750 --> 00:00:21.510
This particular folder consist of several files,

00:00:21.510 --> 00:00:23.350
suggests Jason Files.

00:00:23.350 --> 00:00:28.370
I've script files nor models with represent packages installed externally,

00:00:28.370 --> 00:00:31.860
which occupied the major chunk off our application workspace.

00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:33.870
In order to run this application,

00:00:33.870 --> 00:00:37.750
we open a man front on the workspace.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.240
I'm gonna open a new terminal.

00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:48.640
They've been city the stock phone book and then NGO.

00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:57.250
So there is also a warning message that this is a simple server used for testing.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:00:57.650
RT.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:03.490
Booking angular applications locally on it cannot be our shouldn't be using in the

00:01:03.490 --> 00:01:04.050
production.

00:01:04.050 --> 00:01:09.930
It has also generated a bunch of Charles could files which are not physically available yet

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:09.930
.

00:01:09.930 --> 00:01:17.350
But if I goto browser and open local who's foretold of a zero called the developer concern

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:17.350
,

00:01:17.350 --> 00:01:22.750
you'll see that in the network there are many files that would have come so All these

00:01:22.750 --> 00:01:27.150
friends are now available here but not physically available anywhere,

00:01:27.150 --> 00:01:29.980
so these files have to be required.

00:01:29.980 --> 00:01:33.090
When we push this in tow a production server.

00:01:33.090 --> 00:01:33.780
Also,

00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:37.350
if you'll see the HTML actual source score,

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.810
you will see that there is uproot slash uproot,

00:01:40.810 --> 00:01:43.080
which is there in our application also,

00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:45.890
so you can see that under SRC index,

00:01:45.890 --> 00:01:48.350
HTML has approved slash uproot.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.850
But between slash uproot and slash body,

00:01:51.850 --> 00:01:56.450
you can see that there is a lot off script injection that has taken place.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:01:57.980
So in reality,

00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:02.670
we need this index html on not they laid siege to Mel what we're having in our application

00:02:02.670 --> 00:02:03.150
directory.

00:02:03.150 --> 00:02:10.470
So in orderto convert this application into a format which can be given to a production

00:02:10.470 --> 00:02:10.990
server,

00:02:10.990 --> 00:02:15.190
we have toe compile all our PS files in tow.

00:02:15.190 --> 00:02:16.020
Appropriate.

00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:18.260
HTM and child was tipsy as a spice,

00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:20.730
and this process is called us building.

00:02:20.730 --> 00:02:21.630
Andi.

00:02:21.630 --> 00:02:26.550
It's very simple because angular comes with its own building tools.

00:02:26.550 --> 00:02:28.790
So if a good of the package Doc Jason here,

00:02:28.790 --> 00:02:35.290
you can see that there is a command called Build which represents n g build onda.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:39.810
We can also run the energy bill that directly So let's go have a look at that in the

00:02:39.810 --> 00:02:40.660
command prompt.

00:02:40.660 --> 00:02:42.060
So I'm gonna stop.

00:02:42.060 --> 00:02:49.330
The developments are worth by pressing control Z and then type n g build held a lot of

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.590
options over here.

00:02:50.590 --> 00:02:53.230
We may not be using all of them at all.

00:02:53.230 --> 00:02:55.820
The first thing you have to look at is the usage.

00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:57.230
It says n g build,

00:02:57.230 --> 00:02:59.630
which is a project work space on,

00:02:59.630 --> 00:03:01.120
then the options.

00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:01.720
Now,

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:03.010
if you omit the project,

00:03:03.010 --> 00:03:03.560
what space?

00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:06.050
It'll assume that you are in the works with itself.

00:03:06.050 --> 00:03:07.640
There are few other options,

00:03:07.640 --> 00:03:08.850
like a Woody,

00:03:08.850 --> 00:03:11.480
which is called ahead of time compilation.

00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.370
We will discuss this in a separate video.

00:03:14.370 --> 00:03:20.090
Then you have something called based A true if the Ural off the application being built.

00:03:20.090 --> 00:03:23.000
We will also have a look into this when we build on.

00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.850
If you run into a problem how this can help us?

00:03:25.850 --> 00:03:28.890
There are a few other options.

00:03:28.890 --> 00:03:31.580
One off them is the s trash prod.

00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.150
When true sets the bill configuration to the production target,

00:03:35.150 --> 00:03:40.050
these are the only two options that we might be recording to use Dash es Kort.

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:43.400
And that's just product that's going to try this out as off.

00:03:43.400 --> 00:03:43.620
Now,

00:03:43.620 --> 00:03:47.740
if you see there is no folder corner ist,

00:03:47.740 --> 00:03:53.500
when you finish the build process that this folder is created automatically that starts

00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:54.730
energy build.

00:03:54.730 --> 00:03:57.230
That's just wrong on that.

00:03:57.230 --> 00:03:59.580
Just a body press enter,

00:03:59.580 --> 00:04:03.080
depending on the speed of the computer size of the application.

00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.050
This may take some time,

00:04:05.050 --> 00:04:14.020
so in my case it took almost 35 seconds,

00:04:14.020 --> 00:04:16.370
which is quite some time.

00:04:16.370 --> 00:04:19.660
There are few files that you can see runtime dot Js,

00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.280
which is 1.41 kilobytes mangers,

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.510
which is only 388 kilobytes on.

00:04:26.510 --> 00:04:28.810
Pretty much all of them are incubates,

00:04:28.810 --> 00:04:33.960
and you can also see that the bootstrap that we have added has been externalized into

00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.170
styles on some hash number,

00:04:36.170 --> 00:04:37.230
Garcia says.

00:04:37.230 --> 00:04:38.070
So the style,

00:04:38.070 --> 00:04:38.730
for example,

00:04:38.730 --> 00:04:40.670
is a 136 kilobytes.

00:04:40.670 --> 00:04:44.550
But if you want to compare this with the one which we generated during,

00:04:44.550 --> 00:04:46.050
the developments are work.

00:04:46.050 --> 00:04:47.360
So if I scroll up,

00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:53.060
you can see that styles Js is that on one point 09 MB.

00:04:53.060 --> 00:04:57.870
Wender Jay's etcetera are 4.0 toe MBI,

00:04:57.870 --> 00:05:01.510
which is all in megabytes and hear everything is in kilobytes.

00:05:01.510 --> 00:05:04.460
If you also see the new director structure,

00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:07.150
there is this folder I can see.

00:05:07.150 --> 00:05:09.250
What is there in that test folder.

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.780
It consists off phone book app director.

00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:15.760
That's how project to build a directory has some license files,

00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:17.850
all the assets which we had,

00:05:17.850 --> 00:05:19.090
such as images.

00:05:19.090 --> 00:05:21.970
They're all kept over here a D for Fair Wycombe.

00:05:21.970 --> 00:05:23.230
But we can change.

00:05:23.230 --> 00:05:25.590
There's only one single HTML,

00:05:25.590 --> 00:05:27.200
even though we created one.

00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:27.640
HTM.

00:05:27.640 --> 00:05:29.450
And for each of four components,

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:31.070
everything is bundled in tow.

00:05:31.070 --> 00:05:32.250
Main door chairs.

00:05:32.250 --> 00:05:34.670
There is no additional HTML files,

00:05:34.670 --> 00:05:39.760
so hence this is called as a static content off your application.

00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:43.310
So when this is deployed and access by a poser,

00:05:43.310 --> 00:05:47.620
then that application runs on the client's browser.

00:05:47.620 --> 00:05:49.350
So there is no service,

00:05:49.350 --> 00:05:50.860
a requirement off course.

00:05:50.860 --> 00:05:54.420
We still have our rest endpoint requirement.

00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.650
But after US deployment is concerned,

00:05:56.650 --> 00:06:01.730
these are the files that we have to deploy on toe a production server for deployment.

00:06:01.730 --> 00:06:08.120
There are many options we have number One option would be a CD in which stand for content

00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:09.050
delivery network.

00:06:09.050 --> 00:06:15.240
There is a shared hosting such as the one I'm using on Go Daddy are there are lower

00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:19.070
platforms like Google Cloud or Amazon Cloudwatch.

00:06:19.070 --> 00:06:20.250
And there are many,

00:06:20.250 --> 00:06:21.840
many options you have for us.

00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.730
Closer concept.

00:06:22.730 --> 00:06:28.250
One of the Syrian that we can explore is what school searched our message.

00:06:28.250 --> 00:06:38.450
This is a Syrian for hosting static websites with some sub domains as well as past

00:06:38.450 --> 00:06:39.220
undermines.

00:06:39.220 --> 00:06:40.690
If you go to the pricing,

00:06:40.690 --> 00:06:46.790
you can see that there is a free usage of level which has got unlimited publishing options

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:46.790
.

00:06:46.790 --> 00:06:49.460
Cast undermines basic SSL.

00:06:49.460 --> 00:06:52.190
All you have to do is to start using it.

00:06:52.190 --> 00:06:54.250
There's absolutely no strings that test.

00:06:54.250 --> 00:06:59.780
There was also $30 per month options which has got unlimited projects,

00:06:59.780 --> 00:07:01.050
unlimited publisher,

00:07:01.050 --> 00:07:02.880
custom domain custom,

00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:05.310
SSL on and many other features.

00:07:05.310 --> 00:07:05.890
Of course,

00:07:05.890 --> 00:07:08.060
for the demonstration purposes,

00:07:08.060 --> 00:07:12.400
we will be using this free option on the way you can start working with.

00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:13.820
This is very simple.

00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.610
Let me demonstrate the same.

00:07:15.610 --> 00:07:17.750
The first thing 1,000,000,000 to do is tow.

00:07:17.750 --> 00:07:21.870
Install this onto your computer by using N b.

00:07:21.870 --> 00:07:22.280
M.

00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:27.050
Installed that chief all global on anti search.

00:07:27.050 --> 00:07:34.750
So I ran into this problem while installing because on Mac,

00:07:34.750 --> 00:07:37.540
in order to install a global package,

00:07:37.540 --> 00:07:43.810
we have to run with the sudo commands when you hear this real time pseudo and we have been

00:07:43.810 --> 00:07:46.160
starved Death G,

00:07:46.160 --> 00:07:55.190
and then they search in the and this time there shouldn't be a problem and it has been

00:07:55.190 --> 00:07:56.500
installed successfully.

00:07:56.500 --> 00:08:00.000
And if I take your search that stash health,

00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:05.690
it will give me few options that the command here toe best who I have loved in us.

00:08:05.690 --> 00:08:06.650
And if I have loved him,

00:08:06.650 --> 00:08:07.560
I can lock out.

00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:08.940
I can log in back.

00:08:08.940 --> 00:08:11.850
I can list all the projects that I have deployed.

00:08:11.850 --> 00:08:14.150
I can limo a project.

00:08:14.150 --> 00:08:17.650
I can also see what kind of plan is mine.

00:08:17.650 --> 00:08:18.630
So it's very,

00:08:18.630 --> 00:08:22.410
very simple notice that I haven't created account yet,

00:08:22.410 --> 00:08:25.190
so I'll have to do is tow Run the search command,

00:08:25.190 --> 00:08:31.560
and it's going to ask me What is the email notice that it is going toe log in if my email

00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.670
already exists,

00:08:32.670 --> 00:08:38.740
or it will clear the new search account by entering the new email on the password.

00:08:38.740 --> 00:08:40.650
So I'm rented my emails.

00:08:40.650 --> 00:08:41.440
Andi,

00:08:41.440 --> 00:08:42.140
it'll ask me,

00:08:42.140 --> 00:08:44.320
what's the password into the password?

00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:45.930
This could be a new password.

00:08:45.930 --> 00:08:51.400
If you're a first time user has ended and then it'll ask you watch the project location.

00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:54.490
Right now it's finding to my working directly,

00:08:54.490 --> 00:08:56.850
which is on the stop for look up.

00:08:56.850 --> 00:09:03.560
But the one that I want to deploy is there in the best phone book at And then I was tender

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:03.560
.

00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:04.320
It last me.

00:09:04.320 --> 00:09:04.860
What's that?

00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:04.930
Oh,

00:09:04.930 --> 00:09:05.620
my name.

00:09:05.620 --> 00:09:06.860
It gives you funny names.

00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:07.450
Additions,

00:09:07.450 --> 00:09:09.640
like in this case brought operettas.

00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:11.000
I don't want this.

00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.120
I'm gonna say N g seven phone book on I pressed Enter.

00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:25.380
In case if this though my name N G seven phone book has already bean used by someone else,

00:09:25.380 --> 00:09:29.690
it will give me an other saying that you don't have access to this particular divine.

00:09:29.690 --> 00:09:34.420
But if this is your own mind and you're tryingto specify Dr my name,

00:09:34.420 --> 00:09:36.450
it will simply overwrite without asking.

00:09:36.450 --> 00:09:37.650
So be careful with that,

00:09:37.650 --> 00:09:43.520
because Ender looks like Engy seven phonebook waas available.

00:09:43.520 --> 00:09:47.970
And now it has been published successfully tow n g seven phone book.

00:09:47.970 --> 00:09:52.930
Let's go to the Ural and then have a look at how this looks like so I can go to a browser

00:09:52.930 --> 00:09:53.490
open.

00:09:53.490 --> 00:09:58.880
And you that g seven phone book dot says you're such a press.

00:09:58.880 --> 00:10:04.330
Enter and you can see my application is now served from a remote Web server,

00:10:04.330 --> 00:10:06.250
not from local atop.

00:10:06.250 --> 00:10:12.010
But there's one small problem here because when I goto a contact list here,

00:10:12.010 --> 00:10:15.710
the contact list fittest from a local rest endpoint.

00:10:15.710 --> 00:10:16.270
For example,

00:10:16.270 --> 00:10:20.030
If I goto developer console and look at Network Tab,

00:10:20.030 --> 00:10:21.060
for example,

00:10:21.060 --> 00:10:24.040
http requests kick on the contact list.

00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:29.770
You'll see that it comes back with a for not for better so you can have a look at that.

00:10:29.770 --> 00:10:32.010
Had a message here.

00:10:32.010 --> 00:10:38.570
It says that local 43 double zero slash contact page number one if failed.

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:39.550
So obviously,

00:10:39.550 --> 00:10:43.590
we have to ensure that our resting point is running.

00:10:43.590 --> 00:10:45.730
So I'm gonna go back to the command front,

00:10:45.730 --> 00:10:54.380
NPM run Jason served ender and then go back to the browser Goto home and come back to

00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:55.330
contact list,

00:10:55.330 --> 00:10:58.050
and now we can see our contact list is available.

00:10:58.050 --> 00:11:02.130
Now you must understand angular is only about the front,

00:11:02.130 --> 00:11:07.420
and so we are able to successfully deploy the friend and application to a production server

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:07.420
.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:08.430
However,

00:11:08.430 --> 00:11:09.530
if you're angular,

00:11:09.530 --> 00:11:12.340
application depends on some best endpoints.

00:11:12.340 --> 00:11:15.950
You have to give a valid rest endpoint address.

00:11:15.950 --> 00:11:17.390
At this point in time,

00:11:17.390 --> 00:11:18.460
we don't have this,

00:11:18.460 --> 00:11:21.540
but If you have access to a remote rest endpoint,

00:11:21.540 --> 00:11:22.970
please update that.

00:11:22.970 --> 00:11:24.270
So in our application,

00:11:24.270 --> 00:11:29.820
it is going to be given in SRC at service phone books that we start here.

00:11:29.820 --> 00:11:35.460
So this is the location which we have to change in order to access this restaurant point

00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.650
from anymore endpoint.

00:11:36.650 --> 00:11:42.990
One more deployment option we have is by deploying onto a shared hosting server.

00:11:42.990 --> 00:11:46.790
Let me open my GoDaddy dashboard options here.

00:11:46.790 --> 00:11:52.640
Did my products hear them a hosting options?

00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:57.190
I think on manage here I have Ah,

00:11:57.190 --> 00:11:58.380
file manager.

00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:06.930
I can hear a new folder with the name off N G seven phone booth.

00:12:06.930 --> 00:12:09.430
Si.

00:12:09.430 --> 00:12:10.150
OK.

00:12:10.150 --> 00:12:13.440
And that four there has been created right here,

00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:14.870
so I opened the same.

00:12:14.870 --> 00:12:17.800
There is absolutely no files in it now.

00:12:17.800 --> 00:12:24.380
All I have to do is to go toe the test folder phonebook at select all these files Dragon

00:12:24.380 --> 00:12:25.850
drunk Over here.

00:12:25.850 --> 00:12:26.710
Onda.

00:12:26.710 --> 00:12:28.430
Once it is uploaded,

00:12:28.430 --> 00:12:34.640
we now have access toe our application from a shared hosting so I can go toe in order to

00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.240
cope slash n g seven phone book ender.

00:12:39.240 --> 00:12:42.220
You can see that there seems to be an error.

00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:43.980
Let's go have a look at the better.

00:12:43.980 --> 00:12:47.140
The editors are all related toe network.

00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:51.570
If you see that there is a grunting Js Polly Villages editor.

00:12:51.570 --> 00:12:51.800
Now,

00:12:51.800 --> 00:12:57.830
the reason for this happens to be the location off each of the generated files.

00:12:57.830 --> 00:12:58.120
So,

00:12:58.120 --> 00:12:58.610
for example,

00:12:58.610 --> 00:13:04.580
if you just move the most under Reagan taters we know dark cool slash main dot hash

00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:11.740
numbered R J s while it was supposed to have come from n g seven phonebook slash mean now

00:13:11.740 --> 00:13:14.990
this is where the bass head sheriff comes into picture.

00:13:14.990 --> 00:13:17.150
If I view the beach source here,

00:13:17.150 --> 00:13:22.560
you can see that there that that called based nature of equals two slash which was supposed

00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:27.730
to be slash n g seven phonebook slash This can be addressed in two ways.

00:13:27.730 --> 00:13:32.150
Now one of the way is going toe index html Here,

00:13:32.150 --> 00:13:41.230
edit that adrift equals toe slash n g seven phone book slash Save it.

00:13:41.230 --> 00:13:44.650
And when I come back here on reload,

00:13:44.650 --> 00:13:48.290
you should not see that there is no problem with that on.

00:13:48.290 --> 00:13:55.360
We're able to access the contact list were ableto view them were ableto edit them on.

00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:59.910
We will be able to delete all those things we are able to do without any problem.

00:13:59.910 --> 00:14:04.870
The second method is in the build options we had seen earlier.

00:14:04.870 --> 00:14:08.220
There was an option called based hedge sheriff.

00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:10.020
So while building itself,

00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:16.740
we could have specified Dash Dash Basij of Equals two slash n g seven Foreign books slash.

00:14:16.740 --> 00:14:24.270
So this is how easy it is to build your angular application and deployed on toe either

00:14:24.270 --> 00:14:29.080
Syrian like surgery message or a share hosting like Go Daddy.
