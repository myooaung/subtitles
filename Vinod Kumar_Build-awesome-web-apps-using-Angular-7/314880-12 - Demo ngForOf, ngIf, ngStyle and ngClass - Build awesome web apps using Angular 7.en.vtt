X-TIMESTAMP-MAP=LOCAL:00:00:00.000,MPEGTS:0

00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.710
to understand directors.

00:00:01.710 --> 00:00:04.270
Let's take a new project so you know,

00:00:04.270 --> 00:00:05.350
open a new terminal,

00:00:05.350 --> 00:00:19.450
getting do desktop and take command N g nu to refuse temple and say no for the voting.

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:21.370
CSS is good.

00:00:21.370 --> 00:00:28.680
So once this is done,

00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:32.940
I would like to install Boots star as a Syrian through the directives.

00:00:32.940 --> 00:00:43.970
Timo folder 10 p.m. I put Strapped and also opened the same folder in Visual Studio Court

00:00:43.970 --> 00:00:45.400
by typing coughed art.

00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:50.210
We want to add bootstrapped or angular Chaisson ceviches.

00:00:50.210 --> 00:00:56.870
Here I have to go to the stain section at an entry here for board stuff which is north.

00:00:56.870 --> 00:01:09.320
Underscored margins slash Would stuff slash this to splash bootstrap CS is no.

00:01:09.320 --> 00:01:12.890
We will also run our project by typing energy.

00:01:12.890 --> 00:01:17.570
Self crash hope We will open the application in a new browser as well.

00:01:17.570 --> 00:01:31.310
So the other is because I gave a wrong part to the party's distance slash CSS slash

00:01:31.310 --> 00:01:35.270
bootstrapped Our window C s is go back control.

00:01:35.270 --> 00:01:38.360
See Onda run the same command once again.

00:01:38.360 --> 00:01:49.650
So now our obligation is ready and let's go and add a new component to test the direct use

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:49.650
.

00:01:49.650 --> 00:01:55.760
So I opened a new death then they in g g c for generate,

00:01:55.760 --> 00:02:02.820
competent before the four components slash and component of we want to create Here for

00:02:02.820 --> 00:02:05.860
testing Engy for off Did it do?

00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.300
That's a n g for off Devil.

00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:12.850
Let's go to the app component html.

00:02:12.850 --> 00:02:20.010
Where this country is being presented and edit that that's that we see the new component go

00:02:20.010 --> 00:02:21.970
to the AB component html Here,

00:02:21.970 --> 00:02:23.150
get off everything.

00:02:23.150 --> 00:02:33.440
I made dinner as a CSS class in Judy and then I take your ad dash Engy for him as a bag.

00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:34.730
Andi Now,

00:02:34.730 --> 00:02:36.160
if I go back the frozen,

00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:39.550
I should see that our new component is placed.

00:02:39.550 --> 00:02:40.680
Now,

00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:45.600
let's understand the N g four off directing using a core sample.

00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.850
So let's go to the D s.

00:02:47.850 --> 00:02:51.410
First the Taliban even called people,

00:02:51.410 --> 00:02:56.150
which is an a day off any kind of object.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:02:58.680
And in the n g on it,

00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:01.550
that's initialize that with some dummy values.

00:03:01.550 --> 00:03:03.470
So I would like to add here,

00:03:03.470 --> 00:03:04.420
people,

00:03:04.420 --> 00:03:11.000
which is this start people equal stoop on me on inside the AM will create some values like

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.000
,

00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.800
for example,

00:03:11.800 --> 00:03:17.300
leave is revealed H C 45 city,

00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:27.360
and it's also add a picture which is going to be in the Assets folder.

00:03:27.360 --> 00:03:32.940
That's probably kid under folder called Images on.

00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:39.460
I'm gonna copy a few images over here on the part of that would be slashed A sits slash

00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.150
images on Let's assume that it is not our chippy on the same thing.

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:47.030
I'm gonna copy paste few times,

00:03:47.030 --> 00:03:48.450
make some changes.

00:03:48.450 --> 00:03:58.050
So we have four objects in the Ari,

00:03:58.050 --> 00:04:03.560
and now we want to look through this and then present the same details in the HTML.

00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:10.110
So the way we can do is we can go to the HTML corresponding to this Onda.

00:04:10.110 --> 00:04:11.640
Let's get off this on.

00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:13.840
Let's put a H three on.

00:04:13.840 --> 00:04:20.610
We'll say you're N g for off his jump.

00:04:20.610 --> 00:04:28.280
Now assume that we want to display the list off all the people in a Uriel like combination

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:28.280
.

00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.500
So generally this is how it's gonna be.

00:04:30.500 --> 00:04:33.910
And this is a data.

00:04:33.910 --> 00:04:36.240
If you go back to the closer,

00:04:36.240 --> 00:04:39.860
you see that I have one bullet that says this is a person data,

00:04:39.860 --> 00:04:44.650
but I want this good to repeat for every person here.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:46.150
So to do that,

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:52.390
we use the special syntax here n g four off the structural director and the structural

00:04:52.390 --> 00:04:53.490
directors have a thin,

00:04:53.490 --> 00:04:56.380
dark starting their ass trick on evidence.

00:04:56.380 --> 00:04:57.020
A gastric.

00:04:57.020 --> 00:05:02.640
You can see that you get the list of all the structural details here N g For even though we

00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:09.410
say Here it is Engy for off the syntax for using the same is N G four Onda.

00:05:09.410 --> 00:05:11.800
We assigned it an expression.

00:05:11.800 --> 00:05:16.410
Now this expression consist off a declaration of available,

00:05:16.410 --> 00:05:20.720
like let eat off a way that we have it discard people.

00:05:20.720 --> 00:05:24.750
So it takes one person from the people agree on,

00:05:24.750 --> 00:05:27.780
then ascended to a local variable Korpi on.

00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.970
Then we can access the be inside this particular and let slash Alexei first,

00:05:32.970 --> 00:05:34.980
save this now and go back.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:41.250
We should see the same data is repeated four times because we have 4% data over there.

00:05:41.250 --> 00:05:44.120
So instead of having this dummy data,

00:05:44.120 --> 00:05:48.760
we can actually pull the data from the person object p on,

00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:50.040
then print its details,

00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:50.630
for example,

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:58.210
I can say here in college brackets p dot name is from the door city.

00:05:58.210 --> 00:05:59.390
Save this.

00:05:59.390 --> 00:06:00.310
And if I go back,

00:06:00.310 --> 00:06:03.750
I should see now it says we know this from Bangla and so on.

00:06:03.750 --> 00:06:04.890
Now if you want?

00:06:04.890 --> 00:06:05.380
Oh,

00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:07.190
the image off the person.

00:06:07.190 --> 00:06:10.770
So you can also put I am Jean.

00:06:10.770 --> 00:06:14.860
The source is goingto be Peter.

00:06:14.860 --> 00:06:16.420
Picture what?

00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.020
Peter picture is not an actual image.

00:06:20.020 --> 00:06:22.540
So we want the value off Peter picture Toby,

00:06:22.540 --> 00:06:27.290
associate it with this SSC which can be done by putting this either in a calibrated like

00:06:27.290 --> 00:06:35.380
this are we can use the square record for the SRC saying that this is a expression and the

00:06:35.380 --> 00:06:37.030
expression needs to be evaluated.

00:06:37.030 --> 00:06:39.580
Eso I'm going toe save this.

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:40.950
And then when I opened this,

00:06:40.950 --> 00:06:42.980
I did not have any pictures.

00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.770
So if I refresh here,

00:06:44.770 --> 00:06:47.130
you see that because we don't have any pictures,

00:06:47.130 --> 00:06:52.660
it's not showing up the world with at this copy and paste some of the images over here.

00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:57.350
So I have copied the images into you mean this folder.

00:06:57.350 --> 00:06:58.890
And as you can see now,

00:06:58.890 --> 00:07:01.890
if I go back to the closer Onda refresh,

00:07:01.890 --> 00:07:04.010
you should see that the images appear.

00:07:04.010 --> 00:07:06.950
The images are very big in size.

00:07:06.950 --> 00:07:09.680
We want to have a common size for the same thing.

00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.850
So this can be easily attitude by adding a style over here.

00:07:13.850 --> 00:07:20.560
But we can also do that with the help off another directive so called Engy style.

00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:28.220
So the indie style can be assigned a weapon objects so I can define here Engy style equals

00:07:28.220 --> 00:07:31.660
toe a style expression or that here again,

00:07:31.660 --> 00:07:36.980
we're using a square brackets to indicate that this is an expression and the expression

00:07:36.980 --> 00:07:38.900
here as an object.

00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:41.690
And this is the sty property that we want to give,

00:07:41.690 --> 00:07:42.450
which could be,

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:43.370
for example,

00:07:43.370 --> 00:07:44.580
quite on.

00:07:44.580 --> 00:07:48.080
Then I can say here 100 as the safe,

00:07:48.080 --> 00:07:52.430
but we may have to give 100 PX for pixel then,

00:07:52.430 --> 00:07:55.000
in which case this is going to be a string,

00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:00.740
something like this are ultimately we can also assign something like hide.

00:08:00.740 --> 00:08:01.220
Dr.

00:08:01.220 --> 00:08:03.360
P X is 100.

00:08:03.360 --> 00:08:09.540
So the units can be specified over here in this fashion because start cannot be used as a

00:08:09.540 --> 00:08:11.120
part of the key.

00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:15.010
It has to be given in strings like this and save it.

00:08:15.010 --> 00:08:16.550
And if I go back to the closer,

00:08:16.550 --> 00:08:20.270
you can see all the images are off 100 pixels.

00:08:20.270 --> 00:08:21.540
Right now,

00:08:21.540 --> 00:08:25.980
we can also control this from within our component to PS.

00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:26.960
For example,

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:30.980
imagine I'm here a variable called I n g.

00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:32.920
Stine's Save it.

00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:34.650
I go back over here,

00:08:34.650 --> 00:08:35.960
I declare a variable.

00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:36.400
Of course,

00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:42.110
I m j Stiles equals toe an object consisting off height.

00:08:42.110 --> 00:08:44.930
Dark PX is 100.

00:08:44.930 --> 00:08:45.570
Of course,

00:08:45.570 --> 00:08:48.870
this has to be in the form of a a string.

00:08:48.870 --> 00:08:53.010
I can also specify border radius.

00:08:53.010 --> 00:08:54.850
Oh,

00:08:54.850 --> 00:08:56.390
five pixels.

00:08:56.390 --> 00:08:57.260
Again.

00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:00.610
Barda Radius Either has to be with a hyphen.

00:09:00.610 --> 00:09:01.490
R Oregon.

00:09:01.490 --> 00:09:04.020
Use that capital on hyphen.

00:09:04.020 --> 00:09:07.000
R means you may have to give it in courts again.

00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.280
And five p exit the string.

00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:13.150
So I have to give it like this All I can also say here,

00:09:13.150 --> 00:09:15.400
border radius our P X,

00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:17.150
which represents the unit.

00:09:17.150 --> 00:09:19.350
And then I can say you're five,

00:09:19.350 --> 00:09:21.110
save it and you should know,

00:09:21.110 --> 00:09:24.070
See that the radius is applied.

00:09:24.070 --> 00:09:26.570
I might want to give a little bit off margin.

00:09:26.570 --> 00:09:28.490
I can against specify here,

00:09:28.490 --> 00:09:32.140
margin dark PX is also fine.

00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:35.050
So there'll be a gap between each of do so.

00:09:35.050 --> 00:09:40.840
These styles can be now applied on multiple elements if you feel like,

00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:43.940
but we just have used to don I am the styles.

00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:44.620
Of course,

00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:48.680
this is because it's not refreshed yet and never see the Arab is gone.

00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:50.570
Since we're using bootstrap.

00:09:50.570 --> 00:09:54.950
We can also make use off the CSS classes that are available.

00:09:54.950 --> 00:09:56.120
For example,

00:09:56.120 --> 00:09:57.030
for the l.

00:09:57.030 --> 00:09:57.330
A.

00:09:57.330 --> 00:10:04.920
I can add a CSS class from Bootstrap by using n g class on Engy class season again An

00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:10.490
attribute against the we have to supply here an object where the key is the name of the

00:10:10.490 --> 00:10:11.940
class you want to give on.

00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.760
This is a Boolean expression that determines whether the class has to be applied are not,

00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:17.530
for example,

00:10:17.530 --> 00:10:25.560
I can see here Text dash success is true since the peace cannot contain minus,

00:10:25.560 --> 00:10:30.700
we have to put that in a string format and against you know that class extra success will

00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:31.550
be applied.

00:10:31.550 --> 00:10:33.740
If this expression values to drew,

00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:34.650
which is true,

00:10:34.650 --> 00:10:36.300
always I save it.

00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.760
And if I go back to the browser,

00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.950
you should see them in green color.

00:10:39.950 --> 00:10:40.880
Right?

00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:46.220
But I can have your aerial expression that made it untrue sometimes and that Merican fall

00:10:46.220 --> 00:10:47.230
some other time.

00:10:47.230 --> 00:10:47.800
So,

00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.400
for example,

00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:54.340
I can say three dot age which is the age of the person in here on.

00:10:54.340 --> 00:11:02.110
I can now check your Peter age is greater than or equals 2 18 So then you are text to

00:11:02.110 --> 00:11:02.620
success.

00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:04.350
So if I save this and go back,

00:11:04.350 --> 00:11:09.010
you should see that John Doe is not in the green color here.

00:11:09.010 --> 00:11:11.120
We can always have another one,

00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:16.880
and I can say fixed danger in case Peter HD is less than 18.

00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.930
So save this.

00:11:17.930 --> 00:11:20.270
I have now to separate classes,

00:11:20.270 --> 00:11:23.250
one for adults and one for minors.

00:11:23.250 --> 00:11:23.940
Of course,

00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:26.510
this also can be a function,

00:11:26.510 --> 00:11:27.570
for example,

00:11:27.570 --> 00:11:29.680
based on the age of the person.

00:11:29.680 --> 00:11:36.610
I want to get a CSS class here so I can say get CSS class on Peter,

00:11:36.610 --> 00:11:39.140
feature Vida perimeter for that.

00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:39.500
Of course,

00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:41.990
I don't have a function called get CSS class.

00:11:41.990 --> 00:11:43.700
So I have to go here,

00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:50.890
clear a function called get CIA's his class which takes age of a person that I can check

00:11:50.890 --> 00:11:58.540
your if gauge is less than 18 then return extra danger yells I can say return.

00:11:58.540 --> 00:12:03.150
Thanks Dash services Save it.

00:12:03.150 --> 00:12:08.480
Go back to the browser and you can see we get the exact same result as well.

00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:16.530
Now let's go to our html on our here heading to display that you have four contacts,

00:12:16.530 --> 00:12:18.880
so I'm gonna add you're a hit,

00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:30.180
for there are people don't lend corn Index save this began a heading that says there are

00:12:30.180 --> 00:12:31.250
four contacts.

00:12:31.250 --> 00:12:32.610
Let's forward a deal.

00:12:32.610 --> 00:12:37.260
Adoption over here such that when I click on the delete button each off,

00:12:37.260 --> 00:12:39.460
this one by 1 may be deleted.

00:12:39.460 --> 00:12:46.140
So we're gonna provide a button VT end or begin water on.

00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:51.760
Then we put a X mark so that it represents some kind of ability Action.

00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:53.320
When the user clicks on this,

00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:57.500
I want this to be deleted so on Click off the button.

00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:00.780
We want God delete person off.

00:13:00.780 --> 00:13:04.650
I won't supply the index off this particular person.

00:13:04.650 --> 00:13:07.350
Now that we have an expression that says,

00:13:07.350 --> 00:13:09.520
Give me one person object,

00:13:09.520 --> 00:13:12.140
I can supply the person object itself here.

00:13:12.140 --> 00:13:15.170
But what if I want to supply the index off the element,

00:13:15.170 --> 00:13:17.790
be in the air a people So what?

00:13:17.790 --> 00:13:18.250
We can do it.

00:13:18.250 --> 00:13:25.250
We can put a cynical in here and say index as I So the loop variable will now be given to

00:13:25.250 --> 00:13:31.200
me as I and I can supply that valuable I hear the other here is because we don't have a

00:13:31.200 --> 00:13:35.310
function called complete person located one in my t s.

00:13:35.310 --> 00:13:37.060
So I go down on,

00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.070
then say here,

00:13:38.070 --> 00:13:39.320
delete person,

00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:44.740
which receives an index and then I can remove the current element.

00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:44.890
So,

00:13:44.890 --> 00:13:45.370
for example,

00:13:45.370 --> 00:13:49.160
if indexes one then I would like to delete this particular car.

00:13:49.160 --> 00:13:54.270
So the way you can do is you can say this start people don't supplies,

00:13:54.270 --> 00:13:59.010
which takes the index and the number of elements to believe in that index.

00:13:59.010 --> 00:14:01.490
So I want to delete one element from the index.

00:14:01.490 --> 00:14:03.170
So now we have this function.

00:14:03.170 --> 00:14:07.750
So if I go back to the browser and click on one of the record,

00:14:07.750 --> 00:14:10.360
you can see that it's gone and it's gone on.

00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:11.070
It's gone.

00:14:11.070 --> 00:14:12.310
Every time I'm billeting,

00:14:12.310 --> 00:14:16.190
you can see that it's actually coming back with alder,

00:14:16.190 --> 00:14:18.860
the number because I'm using people that lend on.

00:14:18.860 --> 00:14:23.170
Then I click on the last one and you can see it says there are zero contacts now.

00:14:23.170 --> 00:14:24.390
Incident this message.

00:14:24.390 --> 00:14:29.420
I would like to display another message saying that there are no contacts so I can go back

00:14:29.420 --> 00:14:38.380
over here and I can say hedge for there are no contacts in your I've just pooped.

00:14:38.380 --> 00:14:40.750
I see it,

00:14:40.750 --> 00:14:44.990
but we want to display anyone off them at a given point in time,

00:14:44.990 --> 00:14:50.780
depending on the length so I can use another structural directive or n G.

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:55.400
Is which adds this into it down all it removes from the top,

00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:58.380
depending on the condition that we have given here.

00:14:58.380 --> 00:14:59.740
So I want to check.

00:14:59.740 --> 00:15:03.740
If people are land is greater than zero.

00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:05.460
Then we have to specify this.

00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:11.880
If people don't lend is equals to zero,

00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:17.650
then we want to display that there are no contacts in your address book so I can save this

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:17.650
.

00:15:17.650 --> 00:15:18.520
Go back.

00:15:18.520 --> 00:15:25.190
It says here there are four contacts now it is 3 to 1 on details here that are no contacts

00:15:25.190 --> 00:15:26.050
in your address book.

00:15:26.050 --> 00:15:33.410
We may also provide a real or button here which actually can trigger the call off N g on it

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:33.410
,

00:15:33.410 --> 00:15:37.790
which is initializing this notice that this is just another function.

00:15:37.790 --> 00:15:39.910
Angular happens to call this in.

00:15:39.910 --> 00:15:42.710
The component is initialized in the beginning.

00:15:42.710 --> 00:15:45.250
But if you want o re initialize this,

00:15:45.250 --> 00:15:47.040
you can always call this yourself.

00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:47.690
For example.

00:15:47.690 --> 00:15:51.670
I can go here and add another button for a link here,

00:15:51.670 --> 00:15:55.510
or turn your 50 and or three t and dash link.

00:15:55.510 --> 00:16:01.650
And then I say your Lord on and on Click off this.

00:16:01.650 --> 00:16:06.600
I can call N G on in it like this.

00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:10.080
So there is no problem in calling like this.

00:16:10.080 --> 00:16:11.150
But remember,

00:16:11.150 --> 00:16:15.770
NJ on it is meant for angular toe initialize in the beginning,

00:16:15.770 --> 00:16:17.280
when the component is created.

00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:18.970
So I saved this.

00:16:18.970 --> 00:16:20.480
I go back here,

00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:24.550
I have four contacts delayed one by one each one of them are deleted.

00:16:24.550 --> 00:16:25.470
And then it says,

00:16:25.470 --> 00:16:25.740
Lord,

00:16:25.740 --> 00:16:27.010
date of unlikely conduct.

00:16:27.010 --> 00:16:28.790
I learned all the data once again.

00:16:28.790 --> 00:16:31.050
And then there are four contacts once more.
