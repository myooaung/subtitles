00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.870
so using the reality forms were ableto edit the details.

00:00:03.870 --> 00:00:04.630
However,

00:00:04.630 --> 00:00:07.530
we do not have any validations at this point in time.

00:00:07.530 --> 00:00:11.880
So I guess if I remove this were Lanny on,

00:00:11.880 --> 00:00:13.300
then save this.

00:00:13.300 --> 00:00:19.010
You should see that the first name for this person is last because we didn't have any

00:00:19.010 --> 00:00:19.830
validations.

00:00:19.830 --> 00:00:21.330
So just like,

00:00:21.330 --> 00:00:23.780
engaged the template driven forms.

00:00:23.780 --> 00:00:27.850
We also would like to provide validations for the reactive forms also,

00:00:27.850 --> 00:00:30.300
but this one would be much simpler.

00:00:30.300 --> 00:00:35.640
So let's put that landing bank go back to over farm.

00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.730
Andi In here,

00:00:37.730 --> 00:00:41.950
we can define some validations as a less 34 values.

00:00:41.950 --> 00:00:47.250
Now this is done with the help off the helper validators class.

00:00:47.250 --> 00:00:51.250
So let's go back to the angular documentation for a minute.

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:52.470
Open,

00:00:52.470 --> 00:00:52.950
angular,

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:53.290
that are.

00:00:53.290 --> 00:00:59.910
You click on the dogs and the fundamentals we have forms on.

00:00:59.910 --> 00:01:01.450
We have form validation.

00:01:01.450 --> 00:01:02.680
And of course,

00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:04.770
the 1st 1 is the template to invalidation.

00:01:04.770 --> 00:01:06.140
Prefects crawl down a bit.

00:01:06.140 --> 00:01:13.080
I'll see that there is a reactive form validation on one of the mentioning here is that see

00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:14.960
the validators ap a reference.

00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:20.740
So they're building class for validators and it contains you helper functions so If I click

00:01:20.740 --> 00:01:21.180
on this,

00:01:21.180 --> 00:01:23.260
you'll see that these functions exist.

00:01:23.260 --> 00:01:23.890
Men,

00:01:23.890 --> 00:01:27.490
which is the validate of function Max required.

00:01:27.490 --> 00:01:28.870
It's a title.

00:01:28.870 --> 00:01:31.810
Most of these are self explanatory on.

00:01:31.810 --> 00:01:33.710
You should be able to understand what they do,

00:01:33.710 --> 00:01:36.160
and even if you don't so you can take on that.

00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:38.300
It will tell you what exactly it's going to do.

00:01:38.300 --> 00:01:42.640
Validator that requires the control toe have a non empty value.

00:01:42.640 --> 00:01:46.190
So that's what we would like to have here for the first name,

00:01:46.190 --> 00:01:49.820
probably for the email for the four number etcetera.

00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:51.840
So even if I say email here again,

00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:54.960
see that it must be a valid email.

00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.780
This is automatically going to test that it's an email address so we can go back now.

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.250
Andi,

00:02:01.250 --> 00:02:05.160
say here that the first name has no default value,

00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.650
so we give it blank.

00:02:06.650 --> 00:02:11.360
But you remember that when the contact is loaded from the rest in point,

00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:12.410
it will be said.

00:02:12.410 --> 00:02:13.010
But until then,

00:02:13.010 --> 00:02:14.360
it's gonna be a plank.

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:18.800
But we would like to specify that an area off validation cools apply.

00:02:18.800 --> 00:02:19.860
For example,

00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:24.470
I want to say that it is required and it has a mainland off three letters so I can type

00:02:24.470 --> 00:02:29.890
your validators don't require and then I'll take validators.

00:02:29.890 --> 00:02:33.060
Start mainland off three.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:38.890
So this is how you specify a bunch off validations on the similar lines.

00:02:38.890 --> 00:02:42.350
I can specify here for email and phone etcetera.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.130
We come back on that in a minute,

00:02:44.130 --> 00:02:47.960
so let's go back to the farm on do a bit of inspections.

00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.180
We have the contact details.

00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:52.180
Let's click on the edit and we see the details.

00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:53.850
So I'm gonna select this arrow.

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:54.410
Andi,

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:59.300
choose the first name property and you can see that the first time property here has got

00:02:59.300 --> 00:02:59.740
fuel.

00:02:59.740 --> 00:03:06.540
CSS classes that identify the current state off the form element form control is something

00:03:06.540 --> 00:03:07.130
that bigger.

00:03:07.130 --> 00:03:08.120
It supports taxis,

00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:08.940
his class name.

00:03:08.940 --> 00:03:14.550
But he considers in G untouched because we didn't use a mobile device to pass that all we

00:03:14.550 --> 00:03:17.250
have any did that it's in the pristine state.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:19.010
But it also said it's rallied.

00:03:19.010 --> 00:03:24.150
But if I it is this completely you can see now there is some changes,

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:29.300
and it says that it's a dirty object because it's been modifying its been touched as well

00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:31.290
as it is in G invalid.

00:03:31.290 --> 00:03:37.260
Now the n G invalid comes mainly because off the fact that it is a require field.

00:03:37.260 --> 00:03:40.740
If I have bring Lanny back snobby,

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:40.910
see,

00:03:40.910 --> 00:03:42.190
it's bean valued.

00:03:42.190 --> 00:03:45.150
But if I remove three letters on,

00:03:45.150 --> 00:03:50.450
you can see that it's again invalid because mainland is now being violated the same thing.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:51.900
A place to even the form.

00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:58.250
You can see that the form also has invalid state on all these states can be accessed using

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.590
our console.

00:03:59.590 --> 00:04:04.440
Let's go back to our save changes literary people there,

00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:07.020
which is a great point on for the time being.

00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:11.170
Let me commit this course so I don't want to really save between this or anything.

00:04:11.170 --> 00:04:13.430
So let's go back on bond.

00:04:13.430 --> 00:04:18.270
We now take on the same changes and now we see we are in the deep burger.

00:04:18.270 --> 00:04:21.380
So let's go to the concern Onda.

00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:29.350
We can now say here this start contact form dot You can see that there is a status which

00:04:29.350 --> 00:04:34.200
specifies whether it is in the valiant state or invalid state,

00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:38.700
and it says it is valid because we don't have any errors in it.

00:04:38.700 --> 00:04:39.690
Similarly,

00:04:39.690 --> 00:04:45.850
we can also check start contact form dot invalid American teachers phones.

00:04:45.850 --> 00:04:46.680
Likewise,

00:04:46.680 --> 00:04:49.010
I can also check is it valued.

00:04:49.010 --> 00:04:49.950
It is true,

00:04:49.950 --> 00:04:52.030
so we can use either the status.

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.110
Which is the string?

00:04:53.110 --> 00:04:55.390
Are can you the bullion invalid,

00:04:55.390 --> 00:04:56.690
valued functionalities?

00:04:56.690 --> 00:04:59.370
Toe check if that is valid or invalid.

00:04:59.370 --> 00:05:01.650
Obviously we want toe.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:07.820
Make use off this field or make it of this property and control the appearance of this

00:05:07.820 --> 00:05:08.240
button.

00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:09.670
Still expect to the core.

00:05:09.670 --> 00:05:12.360
Let's get it off the debunker on uncommitted.

00:05:12.360 --> 00:05:16.350
This We will also go back toe our edit contact component.

00:05:16.350 --> 00:05:17.110
It's TML.

00:05:17.110 --> 00:05:18.130
We have the button.

00:05:18.130 --> 00:05:24.680
We want to add the disabled attribute in case off the form being invited.

00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.560
So it's very simple.

00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:28.800
Now I can say disabled equals two.

00:05:28.800 --> 00:05:33.760
It's an expression so I can see your contract for dart invalid.

00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:35.860
So as long as it is invalid,

00:05:35.860 --> 00:05:40.630
we make this button base able and using the theme contact formed out,

00:05:40.630 --> 00:05:42.140
valid or invalid,

00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.640
we can control whether it is supposed to be primary are danger.

00:05:45.640 --> 00:05:46.830
So I would have cut this,

00:05:46.830 --> 00:05:52.650
put a handlebar expression and then I'd say you're contact form dog.

00:05:52.650 --> 00:05:54.050
Valid question.

00:05:54.050 --> 00:05:58.140
Mark Delgiudice concert as primary other ways,

00:05:58.140 --> 00:06:04.600
it's considered passed a danger so initially because it is valued,

00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.780
there shouldn't be any problem.

00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:09.700
You can see that it says blue and it's enabled.

00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.310
I can see a finger to peer.

00:06:11.310 --> 00:06:13.600
But if I get it off this on,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.240
come down,

00:06:14.240 --> 00:06:18.060
you can see that the button is disabled and I cant click on that now.

00:06:18.060 --> 00:06:18.610
Right?

00:06:18.610 --> 00:06:21.030
So that's so simple to work with now,

00:06:21.030 --> 00:06:25.890
without even adding any validation rules in our HTML elements,

00:06:25.890 --> 00:06:30.400
we simply added that there is a required on validators mainland.

00:06:30.400 --> 00:06:35.370
So we added the required in Midland validation rules in the form object on that is

00:06:35.370 --> 00:06:37.090
automatically taken care off here.

00:06:37.090 --> 00:06:43.600
So notice that I have not specified here that the form element is required our mainland on

00:06:43.600 --> 00:06:44.570
the same lines.

00:06:44.570 --> 00:06:51.120
I can also say that this must be an e mail address as the last it must be required so I can

00:06:51.120 --> 00:06:53.530
go to this component years on.

00:06:53.530 --> 00:07:02.570
They hear the email has no t for value on I can see your validators Don't e made Plus I can

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:03.850
save validators.

00:07:03.850 --> 00:07:05.910
Don't quiet.

00:07:05.910 --> 00:07:09.000
You don't need to give the mainland fought this one.

00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.950
So now if I go back to the browser on de everything is okay.

00:07:13.950 --> 00:07:19.440
But if I remove this after its simple you can see that it is now giving another because

00:07:19.440 --> 00:07:21.060
it's no longer valid email.

00:07:21.060 --> 00:07:23.750
So I have to give at the root symbol.

00:07:23.750 --> 00:07:27.020
I can't start within a veritable that is also invalid.

00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.290
I have to have something.

00:07:28.290 --> 00:07:31.100
You can't just have a simple text also there,

00:07:31.100 --> 00:07:32.450
So that's taken.

00:07:32.450 --> 00:07:32.930
Get off.

00:07:32.930 --> 00:07:33.670
Likewise,

00:07:33.670 --> 00:07:39.660
we can also give a phone number validation so I can say that the phone number is required

00:07:39.660 --> 00:07:43.680
as a less It's a pattern.

00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.830
So I can say validators start factors on the pattern is either a string on a regular

00:07:49.830 --> 00:07:50.450
expression.

00:07:50.450 --> 00:07:55.890
So I'm gonna go with the regular expression on the regular expression has to have a digit.

00:07:55.890 --> 00:08:02.070
How Maney want the digits until 10 to 12 digits is what I'm expecting.

00:08:02.070 --> 00:08:03.750
US phone number now.

00:08:03.750 --> 00:08:04.640
Because of this now,

00:08:04.640 --> 00:08:07.710
it's not gonna follow any non numerical values.

00:08:07.710 --> 00:08:08.680
Let's go back,

00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.290
do a full refresh and then very fine.

00:08:11.290 --> 00:08:16.110
If that is okay so you can see that right now that the 10 digit prettify it is this,

00:08:16.110 --> 00:08:20.510
you can see that it's automatically now changed toe red on the disabled.

00:08:20.510 --> 00:08:22.050
So I don't do that.

00:08:22.050 --> 00:08:25.170
And if I type here and also bet that is not a load.

00:08:25.170 --> 00:08:26.960
And so it has to be a number.

00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.220
So now that we have done the validations,

00:08:29.220 --> 00:08:34.930
we also have to tell the user that you cannot simply have two letters for first name are

00:08:34.930 --> 00:08:36.680
you should say first name is mandatory.

00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:41.680
So we want to provide some kind of error messages over here at the rescue that will not be

00:08:41.680 --> 00:08:44.370
knowing what is happening with this particular farm.

00:08:44.370 --> 00:08:44.770
Right?

00:08:44.770 --> 00:08:46.220
So let's go back on.

00:08:46.220 --> 00:08:52.740
I'm those messages right here and control the appearance of those messages using other

00:08:52.740 --> 00:08:53.460
forms.

00:08:53.460 --> 00:08:54.170
State.

00:08:54.170 --> 00:09:00.720
So we're gonna go type here a do with probably a class off era.

00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:06.550
We don't have this class we will artists on with to child abuse for two other messages.

00:09:06.550 --> 00:09:12.050
The first error message is for the first name being mandatory in the 2nd 1 probably for the

00:09:12.050 --> 00:09:13.110
mainland violation.

00:09:13.110 --> 00:09:13.780
So that's type.

00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:25.260
Your first name is mandatory and then I'm type your please input at least three letters.

00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:32.200
We want this messages to appear only if the first name has bean touched are dirty as well

00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:33.420
as it is invalid.

00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:36.860
Now we know how to access the contact form.

00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:39.220
But how do we access the contact form?

00:09:39.220 --> 00:09:40.300
that first name.

00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:40.680
Now,

00:09:40.680 --> 00:09:43.500
this is where we have something called controls.

00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.630
So we can i n g If you're on,

00:09:47.630 --> 00:09:51.930
then we say you're contact form Dark controls.

00:09:51.930 --> 00:09:58.540
So which is a list of all the controls we have on that Has first name has won control And

00:09:58.540 --> 00:09:59.840
is this invalid?

00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:02.310
If this is invalid,

00:10:02.310 --> 00:10:06.230
then you show me that Andi it has to be dirty.

00:10:06.230 --> 00:10:09.730
So I'm gonna say your first name don't hurt.

00:10:09.730 --> 00:10:13.590
So this now ensure start the first minutes 30.

00:10:13.590 --> 00:10:18.740
That means something has been changed over there on the change two value is invalid.

00:10:18.740 --> 00:10:21.960
Then only display this one now off course.

00:10:21.960 --> 00:10:27.690
We're also want this to be despaired only if there is an editor's for the first name called

00:10:27.690 --> 00:10:28.400
required.

00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.240
So obviously we have to add one more NGF,

00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:41.590
which will copy this part with a star n g equals toe this force name but others don't

00:10:41.590 --> 00:10:43.110
required on.

00:10:43.110 --> 00:10:44.770
This is the way you specified.

00:10:44.770 --> 00:10:45.360
Of course,

00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:48.410
adults see the collection off all the others.

00:10:48.410 --> 00:10:52.690
If it all there is any errors and do we have the required better?

00:10:52.690 --> 00:10:57.450
Then only display this one and the next one is just a copy based off the scene.

00:10:57.450 --> 00:10:59.150
But instead of required,

00:10:59.150 --> 00:11:05.300
it's gonna be the England violation of a pure mainland on they should take it up the same.

00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:07.830
So it's to a fuller fresh ones.

00:11:07.830 --> 00:11:13.840
Now you'll see that there is no other message appearing because Number one it is not

00:11:13.840 --> 00:11:14.430
invalid.

00:11:14.430 --> 00:11:14.810
Number two,

00:11:14.810 --> 00:11:16.670
it is still not dirty,

00:11:16.670 --> 00:11:17.180
so angry.

00:11:17.180 --> 00:11:17.900
It is this.

00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:18.650
Now it is dirty,

00:11:18.650 --> 00:11:19.650
but it's still valid.

00:11:19.650 --> 00:11:20.950
It's dirty,

00:11:20.950 --> 00:11:21.760
still wedded.

00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:22.980
But now it's dirty,

00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:24.220
invalid,

00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.710
and the invalid is because it is violating the mainland relegation.

00:11:28.710 --> 00:11:31.740
So I'm gonna It is this completely now it.

00:11:31.740 --> 00:11:35.010
While it's the required validation pool on,

00:11:35.010 --> 00:11:37.470
it is displaying first name is mandatory.

00:11:37.470 --> 00:11:39.020
And as in the previous case,

00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:41.140
we would like to apply some styling to this.

00:11:41.140 --> 00:11:44.030
So let's go back to the CSS corresponding to this,

00:11:44.030 --> 00:11:48.150
which is right here and then We'll define a class star here off,

00:11:48.150 --> 00:11:53.360
and we can see here that color is red form style.

00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:54.920
Probably italic,

00:11:54.920 --> 00:11:57.530
and then they formed size.

00:11:57.530 --> 00:12:04.110
We can say your 0.8 PM like 80% off its original size.

00:12:04.110 --> 00:12:05.640
Let's go back to the browser.

00:12:05.640 --> 00:12:07.950
CSS may require a full refresh.

00:12:07.950 --> 00:12:08.750
Let's do that,

00:12:08.750 --> 00:12:10.010
Andi,

00:12:10.010 --> 00:12:11.800
try raising few letters.

00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:14.670
You can see that we get that and a message as well.

00:12:14.670 --> 00:12:16.330
So the same way.

00:12:16.330 --> 00:12:20.240
We can also define other messages for other fields.

00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:21.750
So I'm gonna copy this part.

00:12:21.750 --> 00:12:28.660
We have an email control which has got to elevations this time number one is required.

00:12:28.660 --> 00:12:29.140
Of course,

00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.060
the 2nd 1 is the evening.

00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:33.650
So it has to be a valid email.

00:12:33.650 --> 00:12:35.420
So let's get this change.

00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.340
All the first name to emit Onda.

00:12:39.340 --> 00:12:42.880
We say that email address is mandatory.

00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:51.050
Second message would be like not a valid female expression.

00:12:51.050 --> 00:12:55.670
We're going to face the same thing.

00:12:55.670 --> 00:12:59.390
Toe Full phone also has to validations.

00:12:59.390 --> 00:13:01.440
One is the require.

00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:02.760
The second is the pattern.

00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:03.970
So Anglo cell,

00:13:03.970 --> 00:13:05.350
it'll the first names.

00:13:05.350 --> 00:13:07.730
And then I'm gonna change this to four.

00:13:07.730 --> 00:13:10.650
And they say that phone number is mandatory.

00:13:10.650 --> 00:13:14.970
And here is the fightin.

00:13:14.970 --> 00:13:18.000
So we're gonna specify that this is you can tell,

00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.550
please Input and 12 digits on leap.

00:13:23.550 --> 00:13:25.080
Of course I forgot.

00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.960
This has to be an email.

00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.510
So that's the validation rule.

00:13:29.510 --> 00:13:32.680
And this is the pattern of Telesco.

00:13:32.680 --> 00:13:33.500
Save this.

00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.390
Go back to have browser refresh once on,

00:13:36.390 --> 00:13:39.790
then check If all of them are working as expected.

00:13:39.790 --> 00:13:41.560
So I see one another message.

00:13:41.560 --> 00:13:43.550
I see second error message.

00:13:43.550 --> 00:13:46.350
Now I remove this I the ridge,

00:13:46.350 --> 00:13:47.770
so not a valued expression.

00:13:47.770 --> 00:13:48.870
So I'm gonna remove this.

00:13:48.870 --> 00:13:50.590
It is emeritus is mandatory.

00:13:50.590 --> 00:13:52.040
So it says here pleasing,

00:13:52.040 --> 00:13:53.750
but tend to do well digits only.

00:13:53.750 --> 00:13:56.250
And if any more is it is for number is mandatory.

00:13:56.250 --> 00:14:02.550
Plus the same wooden is completely disabled were not able to go further without making

00:14:02.550 --> 00:14:03.550
valiant entries.
