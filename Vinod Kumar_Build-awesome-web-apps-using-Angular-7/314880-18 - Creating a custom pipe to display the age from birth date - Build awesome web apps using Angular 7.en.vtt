00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.470
Let's get another pipe this time.

00:00:02.470 --> 00:00:04.710
Interrupt displaying a data port.

00:00:04.710 --> 00:00:07.130
So let's display the age of the person.

00:00:07.130 --> 00:00:09.560
Now the age of the person can be in terms.

00:00:09.560 --> 00:00:09.850
Off.

00:00:09.850 --> 00:00:14.790
Years are years and months or years and months and days.

00:00:14.790 --> 00:00:15.780
So to do that,

00:00:15.780 --> 00:00:16.950
let's add a new pipe.

00:00:16.950 --> 00:00:22.050
Let's go back to the same command changes toe age.

00:00:22.050 --> 00:00:22.680
All right,

00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:23.730
it is clear today.

00:00:23.730 --> 00:00:28.210
Age dark pipe tortillas updated the module file as well.

00:00:28.210 --> 00:00:30.420
Let's go back to our rear school.

00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:32.620
It's getting off this one on.

00:00:32.620 --> 00:00:36.960
I'm gonna go into the age piped up ts Let's assume the usage off.

00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:39.150
This happens to be something like this.

00:00:39.150 --> 00:00:40.950
You're gonna supply conduct,

00:00:40.950 --> 00:00:41.340
Doctor.

00:00:41.340 --> 00:00:42.950
You will be free to that string.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:43.720
Andi,

00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.060
that's gonna be supplied toe the age so supposed that.

00:00:48.060 --> 00:00:50.370
This should display something like,

00:00:50.370 --> 00:00:51.110
let's say,

00:00:51.110 --> 00:00:53.560
45 years on.

00:00:53.560 --> 00:01:03.200
And then if I specifying something like this with age cooler one on de So if this one is

00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:03.790
one,

00:01:03.790 --> 00:01:05.450
it should display the same thing.

00:01:05.450 --> 00:01:08.540
Let's assume that's the seafront Andi.

00:01:08.540 --> 00:01:15.830
In case if I have option as to then let's aged 45 years on day,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:20.380
four months and if I have another one That's a for example.

00:01:20.380 --> 00:01:21.060
Three.

00:01:21.060 --> 00:01:23.320
It's supposed to be like 45 years,

00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:26.120
four months on seventies,

00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.070
an RV Trevelyan taking so this.

00:01:30.070 --> 00:01:30.550
No,

00:01:30.550 --> 00:01:32.320
we can see that in this particular case,

00:01:32.320 --> 00:01:36.270
I'm not having any additional information in here.

00:01:36.270 --> 00:01:38.380
I have one additional information,

00:01:38.380 --> 00:01:40.780
which is like one on here.

00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.320
It is to an inherited street.

00:01:42.320 --> 00:01:42.840
Now.

00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.340
The way this works is that the left time said off the pipe use age that's here will be

00:01:48.340 --> 00:01:49.850
considered at the first argument.

00:01:49.850 --> 00:01:56.730
And after that you can say colon and any additional perimeters if only supply multiple

00:01:56.730 --> 00:02:01.240
parameters than you can say colon ex school and white full and said and so on.

00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:06.210
So this will be the first argument This will be The second argument is the third argument,

00:02:06.210 --> 00:02:07.910
fourth and Fear tour.

00:02:07.910 --> 00:02:09.370
So in our case,

00:02:09.370 --> 00:02:11.840
we just want one single flag here.

00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.610
So if the flag is present,

00:02:13.610 --> 00:02:19.400
it is either 12 or three if it is one on anything else than to one tree,

00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:20.530
so it's gonna be this one.

00:02:20.530 --> 00:02:22.610
So this is what we want to define here now.

00:02:22.610 --> 00:02:23.480
So obviously,

00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.510
now the value here is,

00:02:25.510 --> 00:02:25.810
of course,

00:02:25.810 --> 00:02:28.630
the name of the variable Aiken define it to be anything else.

00:02:28.630 --> 00:02:30.280
I can even call it as you will be.

00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.410
And I'm sure it has to be a string.

00:02:32.410 --> 00:02:34.660
So because we know what we're supplying.

00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.680
So this is gonna be a string onda,

00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.140
followed by Let's say,

00:02:38.140 --> 00:02:38.900
for example,

00:02:38.900 --> 00:02:41.280
I call it us flat an optional.

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:42.580
But if that is supplied,

00:02:42.580 --> 00:02:44.350
it has to be a number like this one,

00:02:44.350 --> 00:02:45.130
right?

00:02:45.130 --> 00:02:46.430
But it's optional.

00:02:46.430 --> 00:02:47.110
Why's that option?

00:02:47.110 --> 00:02:49.060
Because I don't need to supply that.

00:02:49.060 --> 00:02:49.610
So here,

00:02:49.610 --> 00:02:50.470
finance apply.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.800
I'm gonna get 45 years.

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:54.410
Now that is done.

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:55.010
You know,

00:02:55.010 --> 00:02:57.430
if since I'm Britain in another right out,

00:02:57.430 --> 00:02:59.380
So if you're gonna use this,

00:02:59.380 --> 00:03:01.660
it will not show you any values.

00:03:01.660 --> 00:03:02.040
Of course,

00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.510
I'm not used it anyways,

00:03:03.510 --> 00:03:04.590
but it's a day off,

00:03:04.590 --> 00:03:09.510
but this is followed by I want to give what is the actual age of the person.

00:03:09.510 --> 00:03:11.890
So that's going at this hour,

00:03:11.890 --> 00:03:12.870
it's tm it.

00:03:12.870 --> 00:03:18.290
So I go to the components contact details component html on.

00:03:18.290 --> 00:03:22.340
Then here is where I've displayed the d will be now along with the will be.

00:03:22.340 --> 00:03:27.350
If I want to specify how many years somewhere you that br for break on,

00:03:27.350 --> 00:03:30.120
then I'm gonna use and pipe symbol and I'll say yes,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:33.870
contact evil be life age.

00:03:33.870 --> 00:03:36.830
So now there is no better.

00:03:36.830 --> 00:03:39.320
But this is not producing any awkward assets.

00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:39.760
As you can see,

00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:40.770
there's no output here.

00:03:40.770 --> 00:03:45.410
Probably I won't provide that in a round wreckage.

00:03:45.410 --> 00:03:47.060
That's fine.

00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:50.010
It's gonna add some meaningful value over here.

00:03:50.010 --> 00:03:50.260
Now,

00:03:50.260 --> 00:03:52.750
how do I calculate the key will be I distorted,

00:03:52.750 --> 00:03:55.580
subtracted from the current to date.

00:03:55.580 --> 00:03:56.830
It's a simple logic,

00:03:56.830 --> 00:03:58.700
but we will see how this is gonna be done.

00:03:58.700 --> 00:03:59.460
I'm gonna say,

00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:00.320
If not,

00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:03.460
he will be just picked on an empty string.

00:04:03.460 --> 00:04:05.570
So we don't really display anything Adult.

00:04:05.570 --> 00:04:06.730
If the deal will be,

00:04:06.730 --> 00:04:07.860
is available,

00:04:07.860 --> 00:04:09.860
we know will appear an object.

00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.670
Let's create a left DT one equals two new date from developing.

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:16.150
So we created object.

00:04:16.150 --> 00:04:22.470
Now I have to tell it What is the number off days are years between them.

00:04:22.470 --> 00:04:31.490
So I will say you're let if equals to date out now minus DT Wonder Get time Now get time

00:04:31.490 --> 00:04:36.610
Gives the time in milliseconds they don't know this is a current milliseconds.

00:04:36.610 --> 00:04:38.040
So we get a big difference.

00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:40.980
And now I can create a ditch object.

00:04:40.980 --> 00:04:44.850
That's quality it two equals Toe knew that off.

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:53.220
New it off this now the only problem here is that it's gonna officer by 19 seventies.

00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.230
I have to subtract.

00:04:54.230 --> 00:04:55.320
It's Let's try this.

00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:02.740
That's type year equals toe 80 to get full year minus 1970.

00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:08.740
Doesn't upset let month because toe dd two dark get month on.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:08.940
Then,

00:05:08.940 --> 00:05:09.450
of course,

00:05:09.450 --> 00:05:11.590
that days equals toe.

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:13.750
Beat it to not get date,

00:05:13.750 --> 00:05:16.250
and that's going to give the big off the month.

00:05:16.250 --> 00:05:16.860
Now.

00:05:16.860 --> 00:05:22.550
I need to return a value based on this flag so I can use your switch case.

00:05:22.550 --> 00:05:30.970
It's also clear that stream that's a let out put it quotes to or I can say age equals to an

00:05:30.970 --> 00:05:31.550
empty string.

00:05:31.550 --> 00:05:32.150
For now,

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:35.260
it's a switch flag on.

00:05:35.260 --> 00:05:41.950
Now I can say here that if the flag is to our get the flag history,

00:05:41.950 --> 00:05:45.650
the flag is one are if the flag is default,

00:05:45.650 --> 00:05:48.590
that if there is something else,

00:05:48.590 --> 00:05:49.390
So for these two,

00:05:49.390 --> 00:05:50.530
we're gonna get the same thing.

00:05:50.530 --> 00:05:52.150
But as like,

00:05:52.150 --> 00:05:52.750
for example,

00:05:52.750 --> 00:05:56.350
I can say here all foot equals toe.

00:05:56.350 --> 00:05:58.220
I can use a back take that.

00:05:58.220 --> 00:06:02.080
It's for em pledged thing I can have variables included here.

00:06:02.080 --> 00:06:02.590
Now,

00:06:02.590 --> 00:06:05.570
this is where I'm gonna say the owner here.

00:06:05.570 --> 00:06:06.610
Yes.

00:06:06.610 --> 00:06:11.200
So that's like 45 years on the then.

00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:11.580
Of course,

00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:12.890
I don't need to say break.

00:06:12.890 --> 00:06:13.600
In fact,

00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:18.370
this is gonna be in the default section here because if it is case 100 people,

00:06:18.370 --> 00:06:19.260
it's gonna be desk.

00:06:19.260 --> 00:06:21.890
But if it is a case to,

00:06:21.890 --> 00:06:22.790
for example,

00:06:22.790 --> 00:06:29.850
I would say that it is already quotes toe years on a dollar a month.

00:06:29.850 --> 00:06:32.780
Waas on,

00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:33.400
Of course,

00:06:33.400 --> 00:06:34.290
very parent.

00:06:34.290 --> 00:06:37.810
I should say break here because if kids to be one,

00:06:37.810 --> 00:06:38.680
only this value.

00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:39.380
Likewise,

00:06:39.380 --> 00:06:42.840
I'm gonna say case three or put equals toe.

00:06:42.840 --> 00:06:45.650
We can say your dollar years,

00:06:45.650 --> 00:06:47.240
years.

00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:52.150
Let's put a dollar a month,

00:06:52.150 --> 00:06:53.260
months,

00:06:53.260 --> 00:07:02.040
dollar This'll is this So we have now given appropriately.

00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:03.870
So that's going to save it and see.

00:07:03.870 --> 00:07:04.390
Of course,

00:07:04.390 --> 00:07:05.830
one thing is I never returned.

00:07:05.830 --> 00:07:08.840
These values I have to say off would save this.

00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:14.110
Let's go back to the Rosa on you see that it is 44 years now.

00:07:14.110 --> 00:07:18.480
Let's go back to our HTML on a flag here.

00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:21.110
So if I say called in to now,

00:07:21.110 --> 00:07:23.000
if I stay with go back to the browser,

00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:26.450
it should say 44 years and 11 months.

00:07:26.450 --> 00:07:35.670
And if I take your flag is three savage go back on It says You're I believe I missed a

00:07:35.670 --> 00:07:36.960
break statement here.

00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:38.650
So that's going out of break.

00:07:38.650 --> 00:07:39.950
Savage.

00:07:39.950 --> 00:07:41.150
Go back on now.

00:07:41.150 --> 00:07:43.940
We should see that it says 44 years,

00:07:43.940 --> 00:07:48.530
11 months and six days on if I give here in the old port.

00:07:48.530 --> 00:07:53.740
So if I say anything other than three that fine as soon of the Syrian,

00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.700
you go back and see it defaults to one and it's implicit 44 years,

00:07:58.700 --> 00:08:02.980
and that is how you would be able to create a pipes,

00:08:02.980 --> 00:08:05.950
which is views of one piece of logic.
