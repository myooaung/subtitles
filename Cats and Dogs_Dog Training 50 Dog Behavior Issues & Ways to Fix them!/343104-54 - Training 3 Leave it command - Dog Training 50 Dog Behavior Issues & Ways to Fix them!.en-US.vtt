00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.220
leg stay and drop commands leave.

00:00:03.220 --> 00:00:10.290
It is a cue that may prevent your dog from getting injured and in some cases may even save

00:00:10.290 --> 00:00:10.950
his life.

Hazardous items that you want to go to leave may include and different agents sharp bones,

00:00:19.630 --> 00:00:24.950
broken glass medications for any other dangerous trash on the ground.

00:00:24.950 --> 00:00:27.250
Leave it command.

00:00:27.250 --> 00:00:33.500
It is your dough to take his nose away from something unlike grope it Command,

00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:37.150
which teaches him to release something from his mouth.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.960
Why starting this training?

00:00:39.960 --> 00:00:43.450
Make sure to have two different types of treats with you.

00:00:43.450 --> 00:00:49.650
The first type of treat should be the one that you don't find severely boarding,

00:00:49.650 --> 00:00:56.250
while the other should be high value treat that he finds pretty delicious and interesting.

00:00:56.250 --> 00:00:57.750
No,

00:00:57.750 --> 00:01:03.050
keep the first type of treat in your one hand and the second type in the other.

00:01:03.050 --> 00:01:07.150
Then place both off your hands behind your back.

00:01:07.150 --> 00:01:14.630
Make a fist with the hand that is holding the street off lower value and present it to your

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:15.850
door for sniffing.

00:01:15.850 --> 00:01:17.770
He met Ryan urging,

00:01:17.770 --> 00:01:19.850
licking or pulling at your hand,

00:01:19.850 --> 00:01:23.250
but don't respond to any of his attempts.

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:27.310
Wait patiently without saying anything.

00:01:27.310 --> 00:01:28.480
Andi,

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:30.660
you're go back so from your hand,

00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.680
even slightly or humanitarian as soon as it backs off.

00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:40.150
And there is a small gap between your hand and your dog's nose.

00:01:40.150 --> 00:01:43.720
Might that be the yes hand or,

00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:44.050
for him,

00:01:44.050 --> 00:01:46.850
the higher relative present in your other hand?

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.310
Never use the same hand you were preventing him from meeting to give the high reality to

00:01:53.310 --> 00:01:53.850
your door.

00:01:53.850 --> 00:01:59.900
This helps to remind him that the streets in the first time are off limits,

00:01:59.900 --> 00:02:02.700
no matter what it beat.

00:02:02.700 --> 00:02:08.250
This exercise a couple of times until your dough constantly makes the decision.

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:14.470
Could his nose away from the streets in your fist now add the words,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:15.350
Leave it.

00:02:15.350 --> 00:02:18.950
Why he's in the act off moving his head of it.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:24.480
This will build up an association between the Q and the action.

00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.750
Repeat this process a number of times.

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:31.070
Once he's responding reliably.

00:02:31.070 --> 00:02:35.150
Asked him to leave it as soon as you present your hand to him,

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:38.000
then revolt him for obey.

00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.850
In this process,

00:02:39.850 --> 00:02:44.840
you are teaching him that leaving something doesn't mean he won't get anything,

00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:49.350
but in fact he might get something even more delicious.

00:02:49.350 --> 00:02:54.860
Once you have created an association between the world and the action.

00:02:54.860 --> 00:02:58.550
Increase the difficulty Level off this exercise for your door.

00:02:58.550 --> 00:03:07.550
Now put the low value trees on your open palm so that he can see and smell old ive the high

00:03:07.550 --> 00:03:14.230
value treats in your other hand and hiding behind your back Show him the streets in open

00:03:14.230 --> 00:03:16.650
palm and asked him to leave.

00:03:16.650 --> 00:03:24.390
Had this ditch it maybe Haider for your door to complain because now he can actually see

00:03:24.390 --> 00:03:25.840
the street right in front,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:33.040
off if he tries to get it close your hand on this will teach him that he will not be

00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:34.850
rewarded for this Obey.

00:03:34.850 --> 00:03:39.850
If you don't obeys your command and leave the streets in your open palm,

00:03:39.850 --> 00:03:44.950
revolt him with the high value treats that you're holding in your other hand.

00:03:44.950 --> 00:03:50.550
Now put some four on a table or the floor and asked him to leave it.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:57.670
Once he obeys you revolt him with treats in your hand nor the one on the table on the flu.

00:03:57.670 --> 00:03:59.550
Next,

00:03:59.550 --> 00:04:01.350
put some treats on the field.

00:04:01.350 --> 00:04:02.810
After that,

00:04:02.810 --> 00:04:07.150
put a leash on your door and walking past the treats lying on the floor.

00:04:07.150 --> 00:04:08.120
Hey,

00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:14.850
fear it is for the streets say Leave it and peace and revolting for his complaints.

00:04:14.850 --> 00:04:16.030
If,

00:04:16.030 --> 00:04:18.050
in case he grabs the treat,

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:20.650
don't try to get it out of his mouth.

00:04:20.650 --> 00:04:25.410
Go back to the previous stage to Rita in him anti.

00:04:25.410 --> 00:04:27.150
He's ready to try again.

00:04:27.150 --> 00:04:32.950
Keep repeating this exercise by placing other objects on the floor,

00:04:32.950 --> 00:04:36.750
like toys or other things that you want him to leave.

00:04:36.750 --> 00:04:39.720
Once your dog is doing well with this,

00:04:39.720 --> 00:04:41.050
you inside the home,

00:04:41.050 --> 00:04:43.720
you can start to use it outside as well,

00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:52.290
while telling him outdoors you Supervalu treats as a revolt so that it is almost impossible

00:04:52.290 --> 00:04:53.650
for him to ignore you.

00:04:53.650 --> 00:04:57.450
More distractions means more things to focus on,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:00.200
but if you're a believer Jack Portrait Board,

00:05:00.200 --> 00:05:04.650
then he's more likely to respond to you better than anything else.
