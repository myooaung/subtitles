00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.760
it is a weird feeling.

00:00:01.760 --> 00:00:04.940
Then you realize that you're being voiced by a dog.

00:00:04.940 --> 00:00:08.900
You may find him staring at you while you're sitting and watching TV.

00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:14.470
Eating your break first or cooking dinner by being stared at by a dog might be less

00:00:14.470 --> 00:00:16.910
worrisome than being stared at by a person,

00:00:16.910 --> 00:00:18.550
but it is still old.

00:00:18.550 --> 00:00:22.510
There are a number of reasons why your dog stares at you,

00:00:22.510 --> 00:00:23.890
and after knowing them,

00:00:23.890 --> 00:00:27.760
you will be in a better position to understand what's up with your dog.

00:00:27.760 --> 00:00:29.950
But next time you find him staring at you,

00:00:29.950 --> 00:00:35.790
he must stare at you to indicate that he wants something from you standing there with his

00:00:35.790 --> 00:00:37.150
day off saying I'm hungry.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:41.040
Feed me if you're mounting while watching TV or cooking food,

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:45.550
he we were staring at you in hope of getting boards delicious smelling treats from you.

00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:52.180
mouth,

00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:55.380
it may be his way of saying that he wants to go forever.

00:00:55.380 --> 00:00:57.100
Staring,

00:00:57.100 --> 00:01:00.650
not always necessarily means that he wants something to eat.

00:01:00.650 --> 00:01:06.720
It can also mean that he wants something else from you dough that can be a little hard to

00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.010
figure out few of the things that he moved running from you can be your attention,

00:01:12.010 --> 00:01:16.050
some patting and tear up a bellied up for a back scratch.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:18.130
In some of the cases,

00:01:18.130 --> 00:01:20.350
this stating behavior is a learned behavior.

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.030
Sometimes you unintentionally teacher dough that's staring me.

00:01:24.030 --> 00:01:26.350
Reward him with his favorite treats for your attention.

00:01:26.350 --> 00:01:28.080
For instance,

00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:31.150
if you give him his favorite treats when he stayed at you,

00:01:31.150 --> 00:01:33.930
or if you patted him or looking for of work,

00:01:33.930 --> 00:01:34.950
many stayed at you.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:41.050
These election off yours inadvertently train your dog to stay ready in the hope of getting

00:01:41.050 --> 00:01:42.450
rewarded for this behavior.

00:01:42.450 --> 00:01:46.290
If you find your dog staring at you with a tilted head,

00:01:46.290 --> 00:01:48.550
it may indicate that he's confused.

00:01:48.550 --> 00:01:54.920
He's trying to figure out what exactly do you want from him if you catch your dog staring

00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:55.470
at you.

00:01:55.470 --> 00:01:57.150
When you asked him to do something,

00:01:57.150 --> 00:02:02.550
it is time to retrain him and find a bit of it to communicate effectively and clearly.

00:02:02.550 --> 00:02:04.170
For instance,

00:02:04.170 --> 00:02:07.470
if you ask your doctor sit and he just stares at you,

00:02:07.470 --> 00:02:09.190
then retrain him to follow this.

00:02:09.190 --> 00:02:12.690
Come out your dog is not being briefly disobedient.

00:02:12.690 --> 00:02:16.620
He's just getting confused when you talk to yourself,

00:02:16.620 --> 00:02:19.550
but taken out by working on a tough assignment,

00:02:19.550 --> 00:02:22.270
Have you ever quote your puppy watching you closely,

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:24.150
seemingly following every word?

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:29.750
This simply means that he doesn't want to miss a possible cue that he may get from.

00:02:29.750 --> 00:02:31.320
Additionally,

00:02:31.320 --> 00:02:34.850
Sometimes he's just curious about what the heck you are doing.

00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.050
You don't might also be staring at you because he loves you.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:44.860

And one of these home runs this oxytocin mutual eye to eye contact between two humans.

00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.640

her husband and his wife to friends can release oxytocin,

00:02:58.400 --> 00:03:00.750
home one in them and standing there boned,

00:03:00.750 --> 00:03:02.090

but in case you and your daughter knew to each other.

Don't try to force this kitsch.

00:03:28.350 --> 00:03:33.520
Let it happen naturally and let your doctor elite hard.

try to redirect his attention to fool or a toy that he likes.

00:04:06.050 --> 00:04:12.330
Wait on the hell is that restricted item with acceptable one and then take away that

00:04:12.330 --> 00:04:14.250
particular item out of his reach.

00:04:14.250 --> 00:04:17.350
You should never stand at the dog you don't know.

00:04:17.350 --> 00:04:23.280
The Dover perceived this Terry as an act of aggression towards him and the consequences off

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:23.280
.

00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:26.030
It can be quite dire to understand.

00:04:26.030 --> 00:04:27.100
It did not back away.

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:28.200
Simply imagine,

00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:32.550
How would you feel if an unknown or strange person stares at you continuously,

00:04:32.550 --> 00:04:34.850
you might find it uncomfortable,

00:04:34.850 --> 00:04:41.060
and we even freak threatened and intimidated by this stating This is exactly how our dog

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:43.950
speed best in just unknown people stare at them.

00:04:43.950 --> 00:04:47.810

00:04:47.810 --> 00:04:48.650

Defecation is one of those times when a dog is most vulnerable during defecation his no in

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:57.450
a position to other fight or flee,

00:04:57.450 --> 00:05:01.040
since you don't considers you as a part of his pack,

00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:06.900

apart from all the reasons that we discussed.

00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:25.630
Still,

00:05:25.630 --> 00:05:29.450
now there can be medical reasons as well for his stating behavior.

00:05:29.450 --> 00:05:32.850
For most healthy dogs stating is normal.

00:05:32.850 --> 00:05:34.720
