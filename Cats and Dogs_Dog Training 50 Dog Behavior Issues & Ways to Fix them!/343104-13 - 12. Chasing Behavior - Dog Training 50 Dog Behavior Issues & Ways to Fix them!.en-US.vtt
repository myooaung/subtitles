00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.070
dogs running after cost bikes or any other moving object is a very common sight.

00:00:06.070 --> 00:00:08.010
But for bad parents,

00:00:08.010 --> 00:00:13.780
this is a nerve racking situation as many dogs get injured and some even lose their lives

00:00:13.780 --> 00:00:16.720
because of this unwanted chasing off cars and bikes.

00:00:16.720 --> 00:00:18.570
Besides,

00:00:18.570 --> 00:00:24.410
people driving these vehicles also gets killed and startled to see these dogs chasing their

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:25.590
cars or bikes.

00:00:25.590 --> 00:00:29.090
So for two dogs get out of this chasing behaviour.

00:00:29.090 --> 00:00:30.970
More importantly,

00:00:30.970 --> 00:00:32.430
why do they even cheeses,

00:00:32.430 --> 00:00:34.550
moving vehicles at the first place?

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:37.790
If you also have these questions in your mind,

00:00:37.790 --> 00:00:40.270
you will get them answered in this lecture,

00:00:40.270 --> 00:00:41.510
along with the vase,

00:00:41.510 --> 00:00:43.650
to manage this behavior off your door.

00:00:43.650 --> 00:00:49.350
The first reason for this chasing behaviour in dogs is territorial obsession.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:55.350
Dogs place value on things that are vital for the survival and cherry trees one off them.

00:00:55.350 --> 00:00:56.690
Therefore,

00:00:56.690 --> 00:01:01.550
they consider it as their duty to safeguard a territory from intruders.

00:01:01.550 --> 00:01:05.430
Box and Lamar get territory through this mill,

00:01:05.430 --> 00:01:09.150
especially to this man off the urine moral.

00:01:09.150 --> 00:01:13.450
They considered that they own everything that comes within the territory,

00:01:13.450 --> 00:01:15.800
and as a result off this behavior,

00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:19.000
they never see any moving vehicle in the area,

00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.520
they consider it as an intrusion off the territory on day,

00:01:22.520 --> 00:01:27.450
instinctively start chasing it because they feel that they're chasing and barking will

00:01:27.450 --> 00:01:28.700
drive away the intruders.

00:01:28.700 --> 00:01:33.240
The second reason off this using behavior of dogs is their prey.

00:01:33.240 --> 00:01:33.750
Dre,

00:01:33.750 --> 00:01:35.790
from antiquity,

00:01:35.790 --> 00:01:39.650
don't have beena companions and have helped us in hunting.

00:01:39.650 --> 00:01:43.220
This very natural hunting behavior is exhibited.

00:01:43.220 --> 00:01:44.840
Then dogs chase cars,

00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:47.650
bikes or any other fast moving object.

00:01:47.650 --> 00:01:50.530
If something's on away from them,

00:01:50.530 --> 00:01:53.780
they instinctively as you that it is afraid off them.

00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:58.250
And therefore it must be a pre and as a consequence,

00:01:58.250 --> 00:01:58.620
there,

00:01:58.620 --> 00:01:59.520
hunting instinct,

00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:00.250
history good,

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:02.950
and they start using the moving vehicles.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:05.820
Let's understand this better.

00:02:05.820 --> 00:02:07.410
By taking a real life scenario,

00:02:07.410 --> 00:02:12.920
you you must have absorbed then dogs and reaches a fast moving vehicle.

00:02:12.920 --> 00:02:16.150
But when the driver stops or slows it down,

00:02:16.150 --> 00:02:17.650
they no longer chase it.

00:02:17.650 --> 00:02:21.980
This happens because then the vehicle is moving fast.

00:02:21.980 --> 00:02:25.050
It seems like a prey trying to escape from them.

00:02:25.050 --> 00:02:26.190
And this page,

00:02:26.190 --> 00:02:27.250
Dr in turn,

00:02:27.250 --> 00:02:28.950
triggers this chasing behaviour.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:32.970
But by chasing these vehicles are furry companions,

00:02:32.970 --> 00:02:39.200
become totally ignorant off the consequences off this dumb behavior chasing Haskanita.

00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.390
Major accidents,

00:02:40.390 --> 00:02:43.630
which can seriously injured them or in some cases,

00:02:43.630 --> 00:02:45.080
even through two effected.

00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:50.750
Additionally chasing people can he to injuries on potential lawsuits?

00:02:50.750 --> 00:02:57.530
Cheesing other animals can lead to suffering for one or both of them and can lead to bad

00:02:57.530 --> 00:02:59.850
relations with neighbors or friends.

00:02:59.850 --> 00:03:01.260
Therefore,

00:03:01.260 --> 00:03:02.410
as a pet parent,

00:03:02.410 --> 00:03:08.450
it is your responsibility to take it off him as he is dependent on you for his well being.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:15.790
It is your duty to train him properly so as to avoid such mishaps as a bad parent.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:21.750
You need to implement certain things so as to prevent your dog from chasing moving vehicles

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:21.750
.

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:26.710
If your dog has a habit of chasing cars and other moving objects,

00:03:26.710 --> 00:03:32.500
the most simple Vater stop him is by keeping him leashed while you take him out for walks

00:03:32.500 --> 00:03:35.750
in order to have complete control over his actions.

00:03:35.750 --> 00:03:39.140
This will not eliminate is chasing behaviour,

00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:44.320
but it will at least prevent your dog from running behind cast and getting injured in the

00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:48.650
crosses as soon as a car or any other cheese.

00:03:48.650 --> 00:03:53.990
What the subject is in sight immediately redirect your dog's attention towards yourself,

00:03:53.990 --> 00:03:56.790
but using his favorite treats all his favorite toy.

00:03:56.790 --> 00:04:00.660
But you need to get your dog before the target off.

00:04:00.660 --> 00:04:04.510
Attention is too close in this interview.

00:04:04.510 --> 00:04:08.690
Then your dog looks at you instead of that moving car or bike,

00:04:08.690 --> 00:04:11.150
praise him and offer him treats.

00:04:11.150 --> 00:04:18.050
For though you should train your dog to associate the moving car or a bike with the revolt

00:04:18.050 --> 00:04:24.230
by offering him treats every time a moving object passes by teaching your dog a few

00:04:24.230 --> 00:04:26.370
obedience commands like sit ins,

00:04:26.370 --> 00:04:29.450
day will come really handy inside situations.

00:04:29.450 --> 00:04:31.240
Treat him to come,

00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:37.680
then called so choice for him and immediately command him to sit and stay or call him to

00:04:37.680 --> 00:04:38.450
come to you.

00:04:38.450 --> 00:04:44.240
Practice this routine until response properly during any behavior training.

00:04:44.240 --> 00:04:49.420
It is very crucial to offer a reward to your dog every time he responds quickly and

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:52.230
correctly after beating him.

00:04:52.230 --> 00:04:55.770
These commands exposed your dog to those situations.

00:04:55.770 --> 00:04:58.080
That drunk chasing behaviour in him,

00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.670
such as moving costs,

00:04:59.670 --> 00:05:00.560
bicycles.

00:05:00.560 --> 00:05:03.120
It's central for this.

00:05:03.120 --> 00:05:05.450
Ask a family member or a friend.

00:05:05.450 --> 00:05:08.840
Children cycle on drive past you and your dog,

00:05:08.840 --> 00:05:12.670
but this commanding your dog to sit or stay.

00:05:12.670 --> 00:05:13.540
If he attempts,

00:05:13.540 --> 00:05:14.950
which is the moving person,

00:05:14.950 --> 00:05:18.270
make it a point to all this is for two.

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:18.950
Then ever,

00:05:18.950 --> 00:05:19.850
he obeys You.

00:05:19.850 --> 00:05:25.650
Continue this exercise until your dog stops chasing 100% of the time.

00:05:25.650 --> 00:05:26.110
Then,

00:05:26.110 --> 00:05:27.750
given a simple voice command,

00:05:27.750 --> 00:05:33.790
you must understand that it is impossible to eliminate chasing behaviour in your talk.

00:05:33.790 --> 00:05:37.370
But this using can be redirected for this.

00:05:37.370 --> 00:05:41.550
Provide other alternatives to your dog to satisfy his chasing coach,

00:05:41.550 --> 00:05:47.540
because boredom can also motivate him to exhibit chasing behaviour in directive.

00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:52.160
Fetch games such as Frisbee can help to alleviate his or to chase,

00:05:52.160 --> 00:05:54.950
and can even strengthen the born between two off you.

00:05:54.950 --> 00:05:56.870
Additionally,

00:05:56.870 --> 00:06:03.380
make sure that he gets plenty of physical and mental exercise as this can help in relieving

00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:03.880
your door.

00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:04.550
Fordham.

00:06:04.550 --> 00:06:06.110
This in turn,

00:06:06.110 --> 00:06:12.020
will help in elevating is chasing behaviour that arises from frustration and loneliness.
