00:07:42.750 --> 00:07:47.550
which can to take backing off a dog by sensing vibrations in his vocal cords.

the cooler response with an unpleasant stimulus for the dog,

00:07:53.810 --> 00:07:56.950
warning him that the consequences of barking are bad.

This stimulus can be a loud voice and ultrasonic noise or in brief electric shock.

00:08:02.950 --> 00:08:07.540
These callers are not very effective as a stimulus from the shock.

00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:10.230

00:08:57.020 --> 00:08:58.880
voice books are removed.

Simply put,

00:08:59.870 --> 00:09:02.550
it is a partial removal off his vocal cords.

00:09:02.550 --> 00:09:07.390
De barking does not take over the dog's ability to buck.

00:09:07.390 --> 00:09:09.550
It just makes it sound quite ill,

00:09:09.550 --> 00:09:15.540
and recipe complications off this surgery are common and can be life threatening,

00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:17.770
including reading difficulties,

00:09:17.770 --> 00:09:19.550
higher incidents off choking,

00:09:19.550 --> 00:09:21.750
