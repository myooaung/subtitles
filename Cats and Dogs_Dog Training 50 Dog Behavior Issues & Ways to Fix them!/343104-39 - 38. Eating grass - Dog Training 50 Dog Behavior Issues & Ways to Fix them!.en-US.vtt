00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.410
Why does the dog eat grass?

00:00:02.410 --> 00:00:05.710
This question always baffles many pet periods,

00:00:05.710 --> 00:00:07.100
but quite frankly,

00:00:07.100 --> 00:00:09.450
there is no definite answer for this.

00:00:09.450 --> 00:00:15.750
However there few curies that have been proposed by various decide studies.

00:00:15.750 --> 00:00:18.610
The first story is the nausea Torrey.

00:00:18.610 --> 00:00:20.790
According to this story,

00:00:20.790 --> 00:00:26.530
when Doc's your symptoms like a leaking carpet leading etcetera before eating grass,

00:00:26.530 --> 00:00:28.350
then they're more likely to vomit.

00:00:28.350 --> 00:00:29.650
After eating the grass,

00:00:29.650 --> 00:00:32.750
they eat grass to induce vomiting in them.

00:00:32.750 --> 00:00:38.950
Some dogs may start breathing when they feel guess e or are having some digestive upset

00:00:38.950 --> 00:00:43.900
when ingested the grass plate because the throat and stomach lining.

00:00:43.900 --> 00:00:47.810
And this sensation in turn because the love to vomit,

00:00:47.810 --> 00:00:51.450
especially if the glasses gulp down rather than shoot,

00:00:51.450 --> 00:00:55.140
although eating grass induces vomiting,

00:00:55.140 --> 00:01:00.980
but researchers have found that it typically happens only to less than 25% of the jobs.

00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:04.650
The second story is nutritional deficiencies story.

00:01:04.650 --> 00:01:09.710
Grass contains vital elements like nitrogen for soldiers,

00:01:09.710 --> 00:01:17.270
folic acid glow fee and other dynasty enzymes out off around 9000 species of grasses.

00:01:17.270 --> 00:01:21.950
Dogs may eat only selective types of grasses to obtain the required ninjas,

00:01:21.950 --> 00:01:22.990
vitamins,

00:01:22.990 --> 00:01:26.550
fiber or digestive enzymes missing from that date,

00:01:26.550 --> 00:01:31.010
so If a dog is getting proper nutrition from his diet,

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.300
it doesn't mean that he might not create on the cross.

00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:37.320
The territory is parasite.

00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:44.110
Torrey Researchers hypothesize that Gas City may have to remove intestinal parasites from

00:01:44.110 --> 00:01:45.950
the gastrointestinal tract.

00:01:45.950 --> 00:01:53.250
The grass passes to the intestinal tract off dogs after warms and parasites and facilitates

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:54.800
their removal via faces.

00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:59.420
And other Curie suggests that dogs eat grass because they like the taste.

00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:00.050
Of course,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:05.630
it's hypothesized that don't retain their genetic association with grass from their

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.610
ancestors,

00:02:06.610 --> 00:02:09.860
who mostly hunted grass eating animals and billboard.

00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:11.050
This stomach content.

00:02:11.050 --> 00:02:13.900
Now the important question arises.

00:02:13.900 --> 00:02:20.230
How can you stop your dog from eating us if you suspect that your dog is eating glass?

00:02:20.230 --> 00:02:24.440
Because he's bored and sure that he's getting enough exercise,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.750
engaging in some fun activities,

00:02:27.750 --> 00:02:35.400
taking for long walks and play within a diet Gibbs like fax order before and if you suspect

00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:39.290
that your dog is eating glass because off some nutritional deficiency,

00:02:39.290 --> 00:02:42.520
consultive it immediately for a proper diet plan.

00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.990
Switching to a bag of dog food,

00:02:44.990 --> 00:02:47.090
especially a high fibre variety,

00:02:47.090 --> 00:02:49.050
could help to alleviate this problem,

00:02:49.050 --> 00:02:52.880
though grass mounting isn't that bad at all.

00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:54.390
However,

00:02:54.390 --> 00:03:00.070
watch out for a certain increasing the US eating by a door as it could be a sign off a more

00:03:00.070 --> 00:03:06.150
serious gastrointestinal unless that your dog is trying to self treat in such cases

00:03:06.150 --> 00:03:09.950
immediately conservative it for the require medical assistance,

00:03:09.950 --> 00:03:15.060
although most experts agree that bracing itself isn't harmful.

00:03:15.060 --> 00:03:20.980
But one thing to understand here is that herbicides and pesticides used in loans can be

00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:22.310
quite toxic for your door,

00:03:22.310 --> 00:03:24.090
especially if ingested.

00:03:24.090 --> 00:03:25.840
Additionally,

00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:29.590
a number of common house and garden plants are toxic for your dog,

00:03:29.590 --> 00:03:32.950
which could lead to problems if you don't mind is on them.

00:03:32.950 --> 00:03:34.660
Therefore,

00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:39.360
make sure that you loan your house doesn't contain any toxic plants.

00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:41.450
Alternatively,

00:03:41.450 --> 00:03:44.900
you may also by a small tree off gas just for your dog.

00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:49.340
This will give your dog a safe alternative for the outdoor dust,

00:03:49.340 --> 00:03:52.280
which could have been treated with pesticides,

00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.270
herbicides,

00:03:53.270 --> 00:03:54.350
