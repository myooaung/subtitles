So then life changes can also cause separation anxiety in a dog,

00:03:19.740 --> 00:03:21.160
for example,

00:03:21.160 --> 00:03:26.600
a sudden change in the schedule in terms of how long the dog is left alone can trigger

00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:28.150
separation anxiety in him.

00:03:28.150 --> 00:03:30.400
Let's take us interview.

00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:32.020
A dog spends all David,

00:03:32.020 --> 00:03:34.210

requires him to be away from his dog for six hours at a time.

00:03:38.650 --> 00:03:44.640
This sudden change in the schedule milita development of separation anxiety in the dog

00:03:44.640 --> 00:03:49.950

For instance,

00:04:17.560 --> 00:04:23.250
he may become fearful of the postman coming in your society because of some past experience

00:04:23.250 --> 00:04:23.250
.

he can also be scared because often incident that took place when he was alone.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:30.550
Example.

If a dog is suffering from urinary incontinence,

00:05:04.150 --> 00:05:08.890
urinary incontinence cannot go because of infections and urinary bread.

00:05:08.890 --> 00:05:09.250
Oh,

00:05:09.250 --> 00:05:11.440

Additionally,

00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:35.570
you also need to rule out certain behavioral issues before labeling.

00:05:35.570 --> 00:05:38.090
Your dog is a victim of separation anxiety.

00:05:38.090 --> 00:05:41.570
Some dogs may exhibit destructive behavior,

then left alone because they can't boot,

00:05:44.050 --> 00:05:46.450
and it is the envy of engaging themselves.

00:05:46.450 --> 00:05:49.880
Such dogs require mental simulation.

00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:51.950
In order to manage this behavior,
