00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.720
one of the weirdest things about dogs.

00:00:02.720 --> 00:00:03.090
They,

00:00:03.090 --> 00:00:05.280
probably before many bad parents,

00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:07.850
is making a whole ritual out off grouping,

00:00:07.850 --> 00:00:09.460
for instance,

00:00:09.460 --> 00:00:13.420
spinning in a circle before finally quieting to do their business.

00:00:13.420 --> 00:00:17.240
A number of Terry's have been proposed by exports,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.450
explaining vital dog spin before Langdon for pooping.

00:00:21.450 --> 00:00:23.600
Let's look at some off them.

00:00:23.600 --> 00:00:24.410
In this lecture,

00:00:24.410 --> 00:00:30.550
The First Daily Associates this with this hygiene on territorial behavior.

00:00:30.550 --> 00:00:35.730
He met spin in circles before pooping to make sure the taste,

00:00:35.730 --> 00:00:37.650
relieving himself in a clean A dio.

00:00:37.650 --> 00:00:39.140
Besides,

00:00:39.140 --> 00:00:42.750
DOS convey a lot off messages through their extraditions,

00:00:42.750 --> 00:00:46.160
like advertising their ownership off a particular territory.

00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:52.310
So you don't like stomping the grass in that area To make a sport more prominent and

00:00:52.310 --> 00:00:53.350
clearly visible,

00:00:53.350 --> 00:01:00.790
this clearly visible poop on it sent then excess of warning sign for other dogs or animals

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:00.790
,

00:01:00.790 --> 00:01:04.750
signaling them that they're entering into another dog's territory.

00:01:04.750 --> 00:01:10.820
The spinning in circles before pooping can very well be associate ID with the dogs.

00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:11.980
Territorial behavior.

00:01:11.980 --> 00:01:18.860
Another reason for your dog spending might be to scan the area for traits let predate owes

00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:25.590
he's in is one of the most vulnerable positions by scratching for poopy and it is not

00:01:25.590 --> 00:01:29.850
possible for him to protect himself from predators very pooping.

00:01:29.850 --> 00:01:31.110
Therefore,

00:01:31.110 --> 00:01:33.230
before getting down to do his business,

00:01:33.230 --> 00:01:38.050
he makes a few SoCal's to scan the area off any potential treats.

00:01:38.050 --> 00:01:39.880
Recently,

00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:45.080
Czech and German researchers have concluded that dogs like to align themselves with the

00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.600
Earth's magnetic poles,

00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.150
particularly the lots of Texas.

00:01:49.150 --> 00:01:51.270
This is yet not clear.

00:01:51.270 --> 00:01:53.720
Why don't like facing the old schools,

00:01:53.720 --> 00:01:58.380
but they're suggesting it might help them to remember their They have marked their

00:01:58.380 --> 00:01:59.050
territory.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:02:01.140
So next day,

00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:02.760
then you observe your talk,

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:04.720
taking it just to do his business.

00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.870
Doing that mad itude don't is you that is doing it despite two,

00:02:09.870 --> 00:02:13.550
as there is a perfectly good scientific explanation for it.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:17.800
The next time when you see your dog spinning before pooping,

00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.150
please take care of the falling things.

00:02:20.150 --> 00:02:25.310
If you find your dog taking a lot of time to settle down for his business,

00:02:25.310 --> 00:02:27.290
don't lose your patients on.

00:02:27.290 --> 00:02:29.450
Don't I should talk to do his business.

00:02:29.450 --> 00:02:34.250
This could create confusion on problems with the stall eating habits.

00:02:34.250 --> 00:02:41.900
It says natural instinct to circle us pooping species let temp open is naturally as this

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:44.680
will help him to relieve himself comfortably on.

00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.450
Naturally,

00:02:45.450 --> 00:02:50.440
if your dog is spinning on trying to go but is unable to,

00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:55.260
this may indicate that is constipated in the situation.

00:02:55.260 --> 00:02:57.150
Consult your vet immediately.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:03:02.220
If your dog is having trouble in finding his sport and he is just spinning,

00:03:02.220 --> 00:03:07.120
you may need to change your walking fruit in order to find a more suitable location for

00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:09.150
your dog to do his business.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:15.340
You don't mean not become for table in relieving himself in a particular area because of

00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:17.650
some perceived trick in that locality.
