It can be compared to the very same feeling and sense of security.

00:00:36.140 --> 00:00:39.500
A child has Venice parents hug or kiss him.

00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.330

That licking gives him what he desires.

00:00:56.850 --> 00:00:58.540
Think back.

00:00:58.540 --> 00:01:00.030
How did you respond?

00:01:00.030 --> 00:01:02.050

00:01:14.900 --> 00:01:19.540
thereby encouraging him to continue this behavior in the future.

Even negative attention can also encourage leaking in your dog.

00:01:24.140 --> 00:01:30.270
Pushing him of a saying no or even punishing him still means that you are paying him

00:01:30.270 --> 00:01:31.010
attention.

00:01:31.010 --> 00:01:34.170
This can actually encourages looking behavior.

00:01:34.170 --> 00:01:35.680

what he may be feeling hungry and maybe asking for food,

00:02:10.090 --> 00:02:13.550
or he might be asking you to play with him.

00:02:13.550 --> 00:02:15.910

00:02:15.910 --> 00:02:20.050
and leaking in the dog vote is considered as a submissive gesture,

00:02:20.050 --> 00:02:20.480
diverse,

00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:22.150
the dominant member of the pack.

00:02:22.150 --> 00:02:23.860

the destiny of flicking you sometimes is to tell you that he respects you and accept you as

00:02:30.670 --> 00:02:31.950
the leader off his back.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:38.670

00:02:38.670 --> 00:02:40.850
have owned his love and respect.

He may also like you if he likes the taste off your skin.

00:02:45.150 --> 00:02:46.230

00:02:46.230 --> 00:02:50.280

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:05.750
and this makes him repeat the actor flicking over and over again.

00:03:05.750 --> 00:03:08.640

00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:09.920
making off the dogs,

00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.660
but there are others who don't enjoy it that much.

Ignore him.

00:03:23.710 --> 00:03:24.920

rewarding video attention,

00:03:33.850 --> 00:03:38.420
affection or even treats the diamond consistency,

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:42.340
your dog will understand that leaking is an undesired behaviour.

00:03:42.340 --> 00:03:44.090
If you have one,

00:03:44.090 --> 00:03:46.400
the occasional gentle keys from your dog,

00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.450
then you can actually train your dog by teaching him the word kiss.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:55.050
Reward the gentle kiss with his favorite treats and affection,

00:03:55.050 --> 00:03:57.100
then deny attention.

00:03:57.100 --> 00:03:59.150
