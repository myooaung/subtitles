00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.650
There are many situations where you are required to call your door to prevent a mishap that

00:00:07.650 --> 00:00:09.950
could hurt him or the people around you,

00:00:09.950 --> 00:00:11.980
for instance,

00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:17.150
when he's chasing a squirrel or is only after it in the direction off a busy road.

00:00:17.150 --> 00:00:20.110
In set scenarios that come,

00:00:20.110 --> 00:00:23.450
command becomes very crucial and life saving for your door.

00:00:23.450 --> 00:00:27.740
But before learning how to teach your dog come,

00:00:27.740 --> 00:00:28.250
come on.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:34.460
Every pet parent must understand that the foundation off a great recall is a strong

00:00:34.460 --> 00:00:35.850
relationship with your door.

00:00:35.850 --> 00:00:40.650
Always keep positive associations with this command,

00:00:40.650 --> 00:00:42.470
for instance,

00:00:42.470 --> 00:00:48.150
giving him high value treats every time he obeys you when you ask him to come.

00:00:48.150 --> 00:00:51.250
But in case when you come on,

00:00:51.250 --> 00:00:53.550
your daughter come and he obeys it.

00:00:53.550 --> 00:00:55.360
In such a scenario,

00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.990
if you do something that it doesn't like or perceives as a negative action like schooling

00:01:01.990 --> 00:01:02.460
him,

00:01:02.460 --> 00:01:05.720
giving him about taking him to a vet,

00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:09.950
giving him medicine for creating him on leaving the house,

00:01:09.950 --> 00:01:14.150
he will start making negative associations with the compliment.

00:01:14.150 --> 00:01:16.130
Therefore,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:20.540
make sure to teach him that coming to you is always a rewarding.

00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:26.620
Some of you might be facing this issue that then you command your daughter come to you.

00:01:26.620 --> 00:01:28.050
He doesn't obey.

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:34.410
It may happen that you don't may have formed a negative association with the world.

00:01:34.410 --> 00:01:34.750
Come,

00:01:34.750 --> 00:01:36.150
for example,

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.550
you might have punished him after asking him to come.

00:01:39.550 --> 00:01:43.330
If this has happened multiple times that,

00:01:43.330 --> 00:01:48.350
though quite obviously will start forming a negative association with this common.

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:51.250
If this is the case with you as well,

00:01:51.250 --> 00:01:56.450
then we strongly suggest picking a new work for asking him to country.

00:01:56.450 --> 00:02:02.760
It's much easier to tell him to an unknown command rather than changing the meaning off a

00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:07.960
command he knows and doesn't like if he has learned to ignore the work,

00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:08.250
Um,

00:02:08.250 --> 00:02:10.950
you something like here instead,

00:02:10.950 --> 00:02:14.080
no matter what would you choose?

00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:18.950
It should always result in great reward for Udo everything he obeys.

00:02:18.950 --> 00:02:22.440
Don't use your dog's name as you recall.

00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:29.180
Vote because you probably saved all the time and the work that you should choose to use for

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:31.350
this command needs to be special.

00:02:31.350 --> 00:02:36.050
A lot of pet parents make this mistake off ST work.

00:02:36.050 --> 00:02:36.410
Um,

00:02:36.410 --> 00:02:38.850
then they're going to take the dough out foot of all,

00:02:38.850 --> 00:02:45.490
or when they move from room to room and want him to come to them in these situations.

00:02:45.490 --> 00:02:49.550
The problem is that the command becomes Toujan list.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:51.430
On the contrary,

00:02:51.430 --> 00:02:52.900
your goal of pity.

00:02:52.900 --> 00:02:53.200
Come,

00:02:53.200 --> 00:03:00.360
come on is for emergency recall And you expectation from this common should be that he

00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:01.800
comes to immediately.

00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.640
When you called him who beating?

00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:05.550
Come command.

00:03:05.550 --> 00:03:09.350
You will lead a partner and some super tasty treats.

00:03:09.350 --> 00:03:11.410
Once you are ready,

00:03:11.410 --> 00:03:15.950
take him to a fight room in your house where there are no distractions.

00:03:15.950 --> 00:03:17.900
Now kneel down.

00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:24.530
Say you're does name excitedly clap your hands or make kissy noises toe Anchorage your dog

00:03:24.530 --> 00:03:29.810
to run to you after a few successful repetitions at the work,

00:03:29.810 --> 00:03:31.340
Um that you want to use?

00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:32.050
For the record,

00:03:32.050 --> 00:03:33.840
they beat Dustin.

00:03:33.840 --> 00:03:40.740
He won't know what come means at first and your other noises and actions will help him

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:41.650
figure it out.

00:03:41.650 --> 00:03:44.210
When your dog gets to you,

00:03:44.210 --> 00:03:46.250
give him a treat and crazy.

00:03:46.250 --> 00:03:50.750
Then have your partner call your dog back with the happy too.

00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.250
I asked him to also give a treat and lords of place to your dough.

00:03:55.250 --> 00:04:00.450
Repeat this process until you dove is racing from person to person.

00:04:00.450 --> 00:04:02.850
Each time he hears this word.

00:04:02.850 --> 00:04:07.300
Then gradually increase the distance between you and your partner.

00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:10.890
Go across the room and give him the common.

00:04:10.890 --> 00:04:13.480
Come when he comes to you,

00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:15.750
praise him and offer him treats.

00:04:15.750 --> 00:04:24.610
Now make it that far for your job for this hiding and in the room and call him given treats

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:24.610
.

00:04:24.610 --> 00:04:27.390
If he obeys at this point,

00:04:27.390 --> 00:04:29.950
Jamie will seem like a game of hide and seek,

00:04:29.950 --> 00:04:32.350
which is exactly the idea here.

00:04:32.350 --> 00:04:35.890
Once it gets proficient in obeying you,

00:04:35.890 --> 00:04:38.260
windows move out to your yacht.

00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:38.850
What a safe,

00:04:38.850 --> 00:04:44.650
enclosed area working outside means you will be dealing with distractions.

00:04:44.650 --> 00:04:49.420
So make sure to use a super special treat to reboard your dog.

00:04:49.420 --> 00:04:50.350
Many obeys you.

00:04:50.350 --> 00:04:50.750
Come on.

00:04:50.750 --> 00:04:54.640
Once this step is successfully completed,

00:04:54.640 --> 00:05:00.500
then work outside with your dog on a leash and with various distractions added with

00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:03.500
surroundings like someone throwing a ball Ah,

00:05:03.500 --> 00:05:04.800
friends dark passing by.

00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.350
And so if you don't doesn't respond here,

00:05:08.350 --> 00:05:09.090
Come on,

00:05:09.090 --> 00:05:10.450
make it easier.

00:05:10.450 --> 00:05:14.650
Like standing closer to your dog or removing some of the distractions.

00:05:14.650 --> 00:05:18.150
The item IQ test is the dough park.

00:05:18.150 --> 00:05:18.730
Ah,

00:05:18.730 --> 00:05:25.370
place off fascinated smells and fun playmates When you initially practice Terry Cole comin

00:05:25.370 --> 00:05:26.450
in the door back.

00:05:26.450 --> 00:05:33.060
Start with your dog on leash and ask him to come several times and binary response to your

00:05:33.060 --> 00:05:33.690
command.

00:05:33.690 --> 00:05:35.240
Revolt in the streets.

00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:36.050
And please.

00:05:36.050 --> 00:05:39.450
If you don't doesn't come to you at first,

00:05:39.450 --> 00:05:43.150
you may need to decrease that distance between you and him.

00:05:43.150 --> 00:05:46.950
Who makes you that he knows what you want him to do?

00:05:46.950 --> 00:05:49.430
If he's not responding,

00:05:49.430 --> 00:05:53.430
you may also need to make the revolt more valuable to anchor.

00:05:53.430 --> 00:05:54.850
Is your dog to come to you?

00:05:54.850 --> 00:05:58.090
It can take months for your daughter.

00:05:58.090 --> 00:06:03.550
Develop a habit off coming to you even cold while surrounded with distractions.

00:06:03.550 --> 00:06:10.750
Be patient and keep on working on training with notes of high really rewards and place.

00:06:10.750 --> 00:06:15.750
You can prove to your dough that you're more interesting than his environment,

00:06:15.750 --> 00:06:18.950
and it's always worth way to come back to you,

00:06:18.950 --> 00:06:22.500
then let him off leash once he starts,

00:06:22.500 --> 00:06:25.950
or when you consistently but call him back to you,

00:06:25.950 --> 00:06:29.950
periodically praising and rewarding him when he arrives.

00:06:29.950 --> 00:06:38.310
Then tell him Go play and let him go back to is fun and gives if most records and with a

00:06:38.310 --> 00:06:42.250
treat after meet up and then it released to go back to his playmates.

00:06:42.250 --> 00:06:43.750
He will never ignore you.

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:44.150
Come on
