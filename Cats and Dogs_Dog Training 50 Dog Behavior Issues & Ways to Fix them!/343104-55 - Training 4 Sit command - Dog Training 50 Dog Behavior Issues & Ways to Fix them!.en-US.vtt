00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.080
If you are training a dog,

00:00:02.080 --> 00:00:03.670
especially young puppy,

00:00:03.670 --> 00:00:04.350
to sit,

00:00:04.350 --> 00:00:08.350
it is always a good idea to train him in a quiet,

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.780
confined space with no distractions.

00:00:10.780 --> 00:00:14.650
A room indoors can be ideal place for this,

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.270
where you can have more control over your dog's activity level,

00:00:19.270 --> 00:00:22.550
and he can also focus better on your commands.

00:00:22.550 --> 00:00:29.270
Another crucial point to keep in mind is that the sitting sport should be comfortable for

00:00:29.270 --> 00:00:30.250
him to sit.

00:00:30.250 --> 00:00:35.220
The surface should need a B two c pre no to colder put.

00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:36.360
Otherwise,

00:00:36.360 --> 00:00:38.520
the act of sitting might hurt him,

00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:41.750
and he might develop a negative association with it.

00:00:41.750 --> 00:00:46.770
The first step off this training is to get your dogs full attention.

00:00:46.770 --> 00:00:52.100
This can be accomplished by standing directly in front off your dog,

00:00:52.100 --> 00:00:56.270
with him facing you so that he can see and hear you Clearly.

00:00:56.270 --> 00:01:02.380
The second step in this exercise is to your him with his favorite treats.

00:01:02.380 --> 00:01:08.110
But this whole retreat in your hand says that he knows that you have it,

00:01:08.110 --> 00:01:12.090
but he can't snatch it from your hand next,

00:01:12.090 --> 00:01:18.270
when you have containing his favorite treat close to his nose and then slowly raise it over

00:01:18.270 --> 00:01:22.470
the top of his head and move it upwards and backwards over.

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:28.050
He said he will follow the street with his eyes and nose looking upward,

00:01:28.050 --> 00:01:32.050
and in the process will not replace his bottom on the ground.

00:01:32.050 --> 00:01:34.330
In this process,

00:01:34.330 --> 00:01:40.730
you need to hold the street close enough to your dog's head so that he won't try to jump up

00:01:40.730 --> 00:01:41.550
to get it.

00:01:41.550 --> 00:01:45.670
Venue dogs here and makes contact with the ground.

00:01:45.670 --> 00:01:46.120
Say,

00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:48.050
sit in a firm voice,

00:01:48.050 --> 00:01:50.050
then immediately offer him.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:52.060
The treat has a revolt for city,

00:01:52.060 --> 00:01:59.590
but don't praise him excessively for obey you because you don't want him to get excited and

00:01:59.590 --> 00:02:01.070
running all over the place.

00:02:01.070 --> 00:02:02.900
Traditionally,

00:02:02.900 --> 00:02:04.760
when you command him to sit,

00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.050
he should have his bottom on the ground and these legs underneath his bottle.

00:02:09.050 --> 00:02:13.890
If you find that your dogs bottom isn't fully rating the ground,

00:02:13.890 --> 00:02:19.830
you can help him by gently easing him into a full set position while keeping the street in

00:02:19.830 --> 00:02:20.740
the same position.

00:02:20.740 --> 00:02:25.450
But make it a point who never force him into a sitting position.

00:02:25.450 --> 00:02:32.310
Try to liberty of globalization during these training sessions because when you limit your

00:02:32.310 --> 00:02:35.660
speech could just a desire come on in that place.

00:02:35.660 --> 00:02:40.830
The command word stands out more clearly to your dough over time,

00:02:40.830 --> 00:02:43.320
very violent and location of the sit,

00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:46.190
as this will help to improve his consistency.

00:02:46.190 --> 00:02:49.330
As he gets better at the sit common.

00:02:49.330 --> 00:02:50.770
Think off of word.

00:02:50.770 --> 00:02:52.550
Release him from a sit position.

00:02:52.550 --> 00:02:59.280
You can use the words release or free to release him from a sitting position by taking a

00:02:59.280 --> 00:03:03.630
step back and encouraging him to come to you back.

00:03:03.630 --> 00:03:10.250
This is the key to this exercise in for a least 23 short training sessions every day,

00:03:10.250 --> 00:03:17.250
it will likely take 1 to 2 weeks off consistent training weirdo to learn the sitcom on.

00:03:17.250 --> 00:03:23.070
Once you have them sitting for varying lengths of time and in different locations,

00:03:23.070 --> 00:03:25.350
you can move on to the stake a month.
