00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.060
weren't you?

00:00:01.060 --> 00:00:08.350
Puppy gets consistent with the sitcom on Stay Command is selectively easy to introduce the

00:00:08.350 --> 00:00:10.350
biggest mistake most people make.

00:00:10.350 --> 00:00:10.950
Why,

00:00:10.950 --> 00:00:12.950
if eating steak amount with their dough,

00:00:12.950 --> 00:00:17.450
he's stating him toe beg that position rather than to hold it.

00:00:17.450 --> 00:00:19.260
For example,

00:00:19.260 --> 00:00:20.490
if you ask,

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.920
you don't to stay and then you walk away and call him to you.

00:00:24.920 --> 00:00:26.740
You are actually dating him toe.

00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:32.110
Beg the position you just asked him to hold in steak a month,

00:00:32.110 --> 00:00:35.450
A combination of the verbal cue and the hand segment.

00:00:35.450 --> 00:00:39.650
We help you to tell your door to stay where he is.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:45.350
Start this training by making your dog sit on a comfortable sport,

00:00:45.350 --> 00:00:51.320
then simply stand in front of him and don't move at this point.

00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:52.950
Introduced the word state.

00:00:52.950 --> 00:00:55.050
Show the farm off here.

00:00:55.050 --> 00:00:57.650
I tend to your dog and safety.

00:00:57.650 --> 00:01:01.070
If you have been practicing the very length sit,

00:01:01.070 --> 00:01:05.650
he should stay if it doesn't and start to move around.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:08.850
Asked him to sit again and repeat the process.

00:01:08.850 --> 00:01:10.390
The build.

00:01:10.390 --> 00:01:15.950
Stay Ah few times before doing anything else so that your dog loves the world.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.450
Say it in happy toe.

00:01:18.450 --> 00:01:22.450
Save your fun tone for when you don't makes a mistake.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:30.650
Be sure to use the same command every time you tell him to stay as keeping it consistent

00:01:30.650 --> 00:01:34.950
will help him to understand exactly what you want him to do.

00:01:34.950 --> 00:01:36.770
No,

00:01:36.770 --> 00:01:40.600
if you know it's sitting for very let's and it's not moving,

00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:44.150
then it this time to introduce the step back.

00:01:44.150 --> 00:01:48.950
Take one step backwards still showing him the palm of your hand.

00:01:48.950 --> 00:01:55.750
Stand there for 10 seconds and then they don't do puppy and offer him treats.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:59.250
Do this exercise over and all,

00:01:59.250 --> 00:02:05.050
gradually increasing the length of the state and the amount of steps backwards.

00:02:05.050 --> 00:02:06.870
Remember,

00:02:06.870 --> 00:02:08.010
he is a puppy,

00:02:08.010 --> 00:02:11.950
and this natural instinct at this itch will be to follow you.

00:02:11.950 --> 00:02:18.840
So don't get first stated on him if it doesn't listen to you initially just to tend to the

00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:21.700
sport where he's supposed to be city.

00:02:21.700 --> 00:02:24.190
Then they sit him and try again.

00:02:24.190 --> 00:02:30.950
Keep correcting him to sit down and never give him a treat if he gets up and runs over to

00:02:30.950 --> 00:02:31.250
you,

00:02:31.250 --> 00:02:33.890
if he stays in his place,

00:02:33.890 --> 00:02:36.770
even when you have taken a few steps back,

00:02:36.770 --> 00:02:40.650
it means that he has started to understand the steak a month.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:44.850
I don't have him come over to you to give him the treat,

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:46.530
This disease,

00:02:46.530 --> 00:02:48.480
him that when he gets up,

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:49.550
he gets devoted.

00:02:49.550 --> 00:02:50.730
Why?

00:02:50.730 --> 00:02:53.850
Your aim is to teach him that stay in place,

00:02:53.850 --> 00:02:55.150
gets him the revolt.

00:02:55.150 --> 00:02:56.830
Therefore,

00:02:56.830 --> 00:02:58.870
when he stays in his place,

00:02:58.870 --> 00:03:00.270
walk back to him,

00:03:00.270 --> 00:03:04.850
say more words off place in happy tune and then give him the treat.

00:03:04.850 --> 00:03:06.900
Once it does tax,

00:03:06.900 --> 00:03:08.250
obey the steak amount.

00:03:08.250 --> 00:03:12.850
The next thing that you need to do is to release him from the Staples issue.

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:17.750
You can do this by either drop in your hand or saying Okay,

00:03:17.750 --> 00:03:20.850
then when the book comes to you,

00:03:20.850 --> 00:03:23.150
give him a treat and praise him.

00:03:23.150 --> 00:03:25.420
If you are using okay,

00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:26.520
we're releasing,

00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:28.840
then say it in a different tone.

00:03:28.840 --> 00:03:30.120
Then you would,

00:03:30.120 --> 00:03:31.450
when normally speaking,

00:03:31.450 --> 00:03:37.500
are there ways you don't might start expecting a treat every time you say OK,

00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:41.050
then you don't get proficient at stay.

00:03:41.050 --> 00:03:43.310
When you are a few steps away,

00:03:43.310 --> 00:03:45.350
start increasing the distance.

00:03:45.350 --> 00:03:47.600
Go five steps back,

00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:52.890
then 10 then see if you can get across the whole yard.

00:03:52.890 --> 00:03:58.650
Remember to praise him and revolt him with a treat every time he succeeds.

00:03:58.650 --> 00:04:01.620
If at any point of time.

00:04:01.620 --> 00:04:04.650
He gets up and runs to you without your command.

00:04:04.650 --> 00:04:08.450
Don't give him the treat and start the process again.

00:04:08.450 --> 00:04:13.950
The next step is to stand at his side and get him to sit toasty.

00:04:13.950 --> 00:04:21.840
Take one step forward and still your puppy may find it a little difficult as he's unable to

00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.060
see your face on to him.

00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:30.050
It may look like you're leaving him if he stays around and returned to him,

00:04:30.050 --> 00:04:32.910
don't forget to praise him for Obey.

00:04:32.910 --> 00:04:37.850
You gradually increase the distance by taking more steps forward.

00:04:37.850 --> 00:04:40.400
Always turned to face him.

00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:45.350
Pause returned to him and plays before releasing him from the sit position.

00:04:45.350 --> 00:04:48.790
When you use the steak a month in real life,

00:04:48.790 --> 00:04:49.870
like on the road,

00:04:49.870 --> 00:04:55.760
it's quite possible that he may get distracted because of the presence off a number of

00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.650
distracting things in his environment,

00:04:57.650 --> 00:04:59.000
he won.

00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.330
If this happens,

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:03.350
you need to teach him to maintain his concentration.

00:05:03.350 --> 00:05:07.650
There are several ways through which you can do this.

00:05:07.650 --> 00:05:09.050
For instance,

00:05:09.050 --> 00:05:12.750
have someone walked past him while your dog stays.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:16.820
Have your friend to pass his dog merely a dog.

00:05:16.820 --> 00:05:17.950
Why he stays,

00:05:17.950 --> 00:05:20.110
wave your other arm.

00:05:20.110 --> 00:05:24.250
Why your dog stays throwing his toys around him.

00:05:24.250 --> 00:05:30.610
Ask one of your family members to ring the doorbell or bouncing a tennis ball as you look

00:05:30.610 --> 00:05:32.150
backward by histories.

00:05:32.150 --> 00:05:33.720
When you know,

00:05:33.720 --> 00:05:37.750
gets proficient at stay Goto an advanced level of training.

00:05:37.750 --> 00:05:45.120
Go out of his sight for a few seconds and then Ritter gradually increase that time and see

00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:46.010
for how long,

00:05:46.010 --> 00:05:49.650
you know can stay in this place with you out of his sight.
