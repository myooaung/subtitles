Introduce him to new people,

00:05:44.350 --> 00:05:50.350
but make sure that these interactions are slow and safe by taking proper precautions.

00:05:50.350 --> 00:05:52.390
Let's understand,

00:05:52.390 --> 00:05:54.350
How would this training exercise work?

00:05:54.350 --> 00:05:59.930
Put you dog in his great and let the visitor stand next to the street without facing the

00:05:59.930 --> 00:06:01.450
dope or touching the street.

00:06:01.450 --> 00:06:07.050
Ask the visitor to ignore your door and avoid making any eye contact with him.

00:06:07.050 --> 00:06:12.450
This allows your dog to sniff out the person at his leisure without dealing with the

00:06:12.450 --> 00:06:15.050
dominant issue created by the eye contact.

00:06:15.050 --> 00:06:16.980
After some time,

00:06:16.980 --> 00:06:20.850
open the window so that the dough can come up and he's ready.

00:06:20.850 --> 00:06:22.860
But ask the visitor,

00:06:22.860 --> 00:06:23.370
Noto,

00:06:23.370 --> 00:06:25.450
make any advancements towards the look.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:30.790
Ask the visitor toe over doing things that you don't men actually find threatening,

00:06:30.790 --> 00:06:32.010
like hugging him.

00:06:32.010 --> 00:06:38.180
And by taking over his head after your dog gets comfortable with the visitor and decides to

00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:39.580
approach him on his own,

00:06:39.580 --> 00:06:43.550
give some trips to your visitor and ask him to offer them to your door.

00:06:43.550 --> 00:06:46.860

You don't to meet someone if it doesn't want.

00:06:49.110 --> 00:06:51.240
If he tries to retreat,

00:06:51.240 --> 00:06:55.810
let him do so while you don't me love to perform tricks in front,

00:06:55.810 --> 00:06:58.800
off you toe please you and to get his revolts.

He doesn't know your dog is test because of the presence off a stranger.

00:07:07.730 --> 00:07:08.820
Therefore,

00:07:08.820 --> 00:07:12.110
it is not a good idea to expect him to perform tricks.

00:07:12.110 --> 00:07:15.810
Man is feeling afraid sometimes a scared,

00:07:15.810 --> 00:07:17.170

00:07:17.170 --> 00:07:19.650
and we even by the stranger out of feel.

00:07:19.650 --> 00:07:21.030
Therefore,

00:07:21.030 --> 00:07:22.030
as a bad parent,

00:07:22.030 --> 00:07:26.350
it's your job to make sure that everyone stays safe around your door.

00:07:26.350 --> 00:07:27.680
Therefore,

00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:31.630
in some cases you may need to restrict your dog in a different room.

00:07:31.630 --> 00:07:33.250
