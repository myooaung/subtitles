00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.450
training your dog to go to his place is a very useful command for teaching himself control

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:06.450
.

00:00:06.450 --> 00:00:13.990
This can be good way to keep him come when someone is at the door or someone new comes into

00:00:13.990 --> 00:00:14.650
your house.

00:00:14.650 --> 00:00:19.930
This simple you and shoes that you don't doesn't get too excited.

00:00:19.930 --> 00:00:21.850
When you have guests at your home,

00:00:21.850 --> 00:00:26.250
you can either choose one place in your entire home.

00:00:26.250 --> 00:00:30.190
Are you going to the separate place in each room Individually,

00:00:30.190 --> 00:00:34.550
where your dough should go when you ask him to go to his place.

00:00:34.550 --> 00:00:41.040
The prerequisite for teaching your door go to your place command is that he should be

00:00:41.040 --> 00:00:41.990
provisioned in down.

00:00:41.990 --> 00:00:42.360
Come on.

00:00:42.360 --> 00:00:44.840
Therefore first,

00:00:44.840 --> 00:00:46.600
spend several training sessions.

00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:47.690
One teaching him down.

00:00:47.690 --> 00:00:50.340
Come on before you plan to teach him place.

00:00:50.340 --> 00:00:50.700
Come on.

00:00:50.700 --> 00:00:56.810
Next Decide where do you want your doctor Go when you give him the place?

00:00:56.810 --> 00:00:57.250
Come on.

00:00:57.250 --> 00:01:00.150
A don't bet Format works mill.

00:01:00.150 --> 00:01:02.500
If you want that,

00:01:02.500 --> 00:01:06.000
you should be able to use this command in any of the rooms.

00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:08.220
Then either use a portable bad.

00:01:08.220 --> 00:01:14.020
But I met that you can easily move from one room to another or pick us supporting each room

00:01:14.020 --> 00:01:16.050
that will sell as your dog spoke.

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.470
Start off the training by standing close to the bed for the mat that will sell as your

00:01:22.470 --> 00:01:23.250
those place,

00:01:23.250 --> 00:01:25.630
say the workplace,

00:01:25.630 --> 00:01:28.950
and then use a treat to load the dog onto his sport.

00:01:28.950 --> 00:01:33.910
As soon as all the four feet off your door had on the mat,

00:01:33.910 --> 00:01:36.250
praise him and offer him treats.

00:01:36.250 --> 00:01:37.930
No,

00:01:37.930 --> 00:01:38.600
repeat this.

00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:40.250
Exercise several types.

00:01:40.250 --> 00:01:46.330
Once the dog has learned to put all his four feet on the mat for the bed,

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:48.150
then you give the command place.

00:01:48.150 --> 00:01:52.260
Start asking him to lie down by giving him the command down.

00:01:52.260 --> 00:01:57.450
It may take him some time to comply in the first few attempts,

00:01:57.450 --> 00:02:00.150
but after a few practice sessions,

00:02:00.150 --> 00:02:04.480
he will learn to lie down automatically when he gets to the Met.

00:02:04.480 --> 00:02:05.950
After you give him the place,

00:02:05.950 --> 00:02:06.450
Come on.

00:02:06.450 --> 00:02:09.950
Once the dog has done this several times,

00:02:09.950 --> 00:02:15.180
he should only be getting treats and place when he lies down after you give the place.

00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:15.650
Come on,

00:02:15.650 --> 00:02:21.560
when you don't become proficient in lying down on his Mac after they give the place,

00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:22.070
Come on,

00:02:22.070 --> 00:02:29.190
gradually increase the amount of time he spends Did don't do this wait for a few seconds

00:02:29.190 --> 00:02:31.950
before offering him treats for obeying the common.

00:02:31.950 --> 00:02:39.050
As you see progress slowly increased this time duration marginally or by small into us.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:45.460
If you don't make some mistake and gets up from this place before you give him the treat,

00:02:45.460 --> 00:02:49.650
give the place tomorrow again and go back to the last point.

00:02:49.650 --> 00:02:49.970
Very,

00:02:49.970 --> 00:02:51.390
very a dog was successful.

00:02:51.390 --> 00:02:55.250
Then slowly increase the amount of time here,

00:02:55.250 --> 00:02:55.480
though,

00:02:55.480 --> 00:02:56.850
stays in his place.

00:02:56.850 --> 00:02:58.670
Next,

00:02:58.670 --> 00:03:04.440
give you don't the place command while standing a few feet away from his bed in the

00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:05.080
beginning,

00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:09.150
rewarding with a food treat every time he goes to his place.

00:03:09.150 --> 00:03:14.910
What time and with practice you will be able to send your doctor the place,

00:03:14.910 --> 00:03:16.350
even from a distance.

00:03:16.350 --> 00:03:17.950
Additionally,

00:03:17.950 --> 00:03:19.260
with practice,

00:03:19.260 --> 00:03:24.150
you will also be able to increase the time duration for which he stays in his place.

00:03:24.150 --> 00:03:27.020
When the dough is in this place,

00:03:27.020 --> 00:03:32.250
start moving around the room by Healy means in a lying down position on the bed.

00:03:32.250 --> 00:03:36.650
Now it's time to pick Mr Command with distractions,

00:03:36.650 --> 00:03:38.310

00:03:43.770 --> 00:03:49.050
his place vit until your dog goes to this place and six on it.

00:03:49.050 --> 00:03:52.650
Then tell him to light on before you opened the door.

Does a three to your door to Anchorage Him to stay in this place by you.

00:03:58.140 --> 00:03:59.250

Once your guests come into the house.

00:04:02.450 --> 00:04:03.360
That's them.

00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:03.580
No,

00:04:03.580 --> 00:04:06.650
to approach your dog while he is in this place.

00:04:06.650 --> 00:04:08.390
Instead,

00:04:08.390 --> 00:04:14.450
command your doctor come so that he understands that he is now allowed to greet your guests

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:14.450
.

00:04:14.450 --> 00:04:17.490
If you want your dough toe,

00:04:17.490 --> 00:04:18.330

you will have to start the training from the big Me.

00:04:40.550 --> 00:04:42.370
With time,

00:04:42.370 --> 00:04:45.280
