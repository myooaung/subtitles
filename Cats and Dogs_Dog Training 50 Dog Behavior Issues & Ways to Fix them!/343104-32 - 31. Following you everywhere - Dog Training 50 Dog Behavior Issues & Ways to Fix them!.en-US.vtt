steak a month.

00:04:24.150 --> 00:04:29.150
This command will beat him that it's okay to be left alone for some time.

00:04:29.150 --> 00:04:32.640
Start the training station with a small distance,

00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.700
for instance,

00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:39.350
just a step off the They gradually increase the distance until you reach a point.

be patient and consistent in your efforts.

00:05:06.770 --> 00:05:11.490
places bit or matter at the place where you want your dog to stay.

00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:23.550
state do livadia dog every time he walks toward his bed.

00:05:23.550 --> 00:05:27.250
Now wait for your dog to lie down on the bed.

Remember,

00:05:30.330 --> 00:05:31.130
Terry what?

00:05:31.130 --> 00:05:33.350
Like his favorite treats or toys?

00:05:33.350 --> 00:05:36.020
But teaching him this command,

00:05:36.020 --> 00:05:39.670
you can redirect you dog to the man or his bed.

00:05:39.670 --> 00:05:40.840
Instead of falling,

00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:48.770
you desensitize your dog to your specific movements until it stops reacting to them vaults

00:05:48.770 --> 00:05:50.660
gets desensitized to them.

00:05:50.660 --> 00:05:51.700
He won't follow you.

00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.650
Every ville on will stay in his own place.

00:05:54.650 --> 00:05:56.470
But first,

00:05:56.470 --> 00:06:01.150
figure out all those specific movements that because your dog to follow you,

00:06:01.150 --> 00:06:02.880
for example,

00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:04.480
if you don't gets up,

00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.970
then you put the remote down frequently.

00:06:06.970 --> 00:06:09.350
Put the remote down over and over again.

00:06:09.350 --> 00:06:11.230
Similarly,

00:06:11.230 --> 00:06:14.460
if you don't gets up the moment you get up,

00:06:14.460 --> 00:06:21.490
repeat this action over and over again until your dog gets tired of responding to it now,

00:06:21.490 --> 00:06:25.350
since these triggers no longer have a strong meaning to them,

00:06:25.350 --> 00:06:27.150
even stopped getting to them.

00:06:27.150 --> 00:06:29.080
Additionally,

00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:31.290
revolt your dog every single time,

00:06:31.290 --> 00:06:31.800
he said.

00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.250
Tell Stone and stopped responding to your specific actions.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:37.860
If you don't becomes cling G,

00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.850
they teach him to sleep at a distance from you.

00:06:40.850 --> 00:06:43.340
If you share your bed with him,

00:06:43.340 --> 00:06:46.750
then unknowingly you are feeding his need to be with you.

00:06:46.750 --> 00:06:53.650
Get him a nice comfortable bed and put it near your bed or in a completely separate rooms.

00:06:53.650 --> 00:06:59.410
Beating him to sleep on a separate bed will instill some independence in him.

00:06:59.410 --> 00:07:01.880

Introducing more physical activity in your dog shooting can pay another effectively to

00:07:08.430 --> 00:07:12.070
correct this behavior as discussed earlier.

00:07:12.070 --> 00:07:17.930
Boredom and lack off mental stimulation can also be responsible for this falling behavior

00:07:17.930 --> 00:07:18.740
off your dog.

00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:21.910
So if you can keep him engaged,

00:07:21.910 --> 00:07:23.480
then he is alone at home.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:28.250
He will be less likely to display this falling behavior when you come back home.

00:07:28.250 --> 00:07:31.270
A diet dog is a happy dog.

00:07:31.270 --> 00:07:32.370
Therefore,

00:07:32.370 --> 00:07:33.820
before leaving him alone,

00:07:33.820 --> 00:07:34.390
Ato,

00:07:34.390 --> 00:07:39.650
take him for a long walk and play some agile games like a fetch came with him.
