00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.730
our dogs to plant of adorable things and building his head and giving you a quizzical look

00:00:05.730 --> 00:00:07.150
is definitely one off them.

00:00:07.150 --> 00:00:09.400
But have you ever wondered,

00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:12.100
why do dogs still their head in the first place?

00:00:12.100 --> 00:00:14.890
This question has been there for a while,

00:00:14.890 --> 00:00:18.780
but there was no country explanation for this till sometime back.

00:00:18.780 --> 00:00:20.610
Recently,

00:00:20.610 --> 00:00:24.550
researchers have found few possible reasons that could answer this question.

00:00:24.550 --> 00:00:27.690
Your dog limiter thing is that toe here,

00:00:27.690 --> 00:00:28.250
you better.

00:00:28.250 --> 00:00:32.140
Some experts believe that when a dope builds his head,

00:00:32.140 --> 00:00:37.370
he's trying to adjust his Billy for outer years to better detect where a sound is coming

00:00:37.370 --> 00:00:37.750
from.

00:00:37.750 --> 00:00:39.480
Let's see,

00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:42.950
you're having a conversation with your friend in a loud and crowded place.

00:00:42.950 --> 00:00:47.650
It's sometimes hard to hear your friend because of the external sounds.

00:00:47.650 --> 00:00:53.280
So you turned one off your ears towards the source of the sun and maybe even use your hand

00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:56.750
to for your ear lobe and local external noises.

00:00:56.750 --> 00:01:02.240
That's exactly what may be happening when you know pills his head simply put,

00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.650
he merely trying to find you in his hearing by tilting his head.

00:01:05.650 --> 00:01:07.250
Indeed,

00:01:07.250 --> 00:01:12.340
your job recognizes the world's that have desirable outcomes for him such as walks,

00:01:12.340 --> 00:01:13.550
meals or toys.

00:01:13.550 --> 00:01:16.780
He might react with these words by tilting his head,

00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.130
a possible sign that he's concentrating on what's being said and hoping to recognize more

00:01:22.130 --> 00:01:22.650
words.

00:01:22.650 --> 00:01:29.860
The other possible reason for this head tilting by a dog is to see better dogs by people it

00:01:29.860 --> 00:01:35.160
does with big muscles are more likely to do it so that they can have a full view off of our

00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:37.350
faces when they're speaking to them.

00:01:37.350 --> 00:01:40.550
He wants have relatively flat faces.

00:01:40.550 --> 00:01:42.710
So when we converse eight with someone,

00:01:42.710 --> 00:01:43.770
nothing obstructs.

00:01:43.770 --> 00:01:45.440
Overview dogs.

00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.340
On the other hand,

00:01:46.340 --> 00:01:52.500
heaven muscle that can globe there's some experts have suggested an interesting experiment

00:01:52.500 --> 00:01:57.510
to demonstrate this in a more clearly for this whole your fist,

00:01:57.510 --> 00:01:59.650
and then place it over your nose.

00:01:59.650 --> 00:02:00.780
Now,

00:02:00.780 --> 00:02:01.590
in effect,

00:02:01.590 --> 00:02:05.640
your viewing the world with a face that has a muzzle like that off a dog.

00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.710
If you now try looking at a person's face,

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:14.360
you will find that the muscle we broke some off your vision and reduce your ability to see

00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.850
the lower part of their face.

00:02:15.850 --> 00:02:21.850
Now fill your head when you're looking at the face of that person with this head posture

00:02:21.850 --> 00:02:24.650
you can now have the full view off that person sees.

00:02:24.650 --> 00:02:25.800
Hence,

00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:31.050
one of the reasons why does to their heads when we talk to them is to see our faces better

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:31.050
.

00:02:31.050 --> 00:02:35.080
Building head can also be a reinforced behaviour.

00:02:35.080 --> 00:02:37.440
With time you don't miss.

00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:38.160
Start to Cory.

00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:40.650
Little thing is head with receiving a treat.

00:02:40.650 --> 00:02:46.350
Let's say you give your dog a cardinal or a safe retreat every time he turns his head.

00:02:46.350 --> 00:02:47.750
Soon after,

00:02:47.750 --> 00:02:49.390
he will start associating,

00:02:49.390 --> 00:02:51.190
tilting his head with treats,

00:02:51.190 --> 00:02:54.250
and you will find him doing this action quite frequently.

00:02:54.250 --> 00:02:56.350
In some cases,

00:02:56.350 --> 00:02:58.310
there can be medical reason as well,

00:02:58.310 --> 00:02:59.590
behind this heavily.

00:02:59.590 --> 00:03:03.350
If you observe that you don't frequently shoots his head,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:09.080
it would indicate that he's feeling dizzy and imbalanced the poor putsch,

00:03:09.080 --> 00:03:14.250
maybe trying to regain his balance or prevent himself from falling by building his head.

00:03:14.250 --> 00:03:16.590
I had the injury over to go.

00:03:16.590 --> 00:03:20.270
Maybe that culprit forest frequent had guilty here.

00:03:20.270 --> 00:03:20.950
Injuries,

00:03:20.950 --> 00:03:21.880
brain disease,

00:03:21.880 --> 00:03:27.840
even toxic antibiotics in the year can also contribute to hear disorders ultimately leading

00:03:27.840 --> 00:03:28.650
to head guilty
