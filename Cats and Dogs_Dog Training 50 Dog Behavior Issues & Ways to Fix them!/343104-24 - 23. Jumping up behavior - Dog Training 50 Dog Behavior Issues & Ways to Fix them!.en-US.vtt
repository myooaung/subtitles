00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.950
jumping up is a very common behavior problem found in dogs.

00:00:04.950 --> 00:00:06.750
But do you know,

00:00:06.750 --> 00:00:08.460
in most of the cases,

00:00:08.460 --> 00:00:14.490
the pet parents are to be blamed for this behavior off a dog's as the other ones who and

00:00:14.490 --> 00:00:18.850
grace this behavior in the popular vote in his puppy hood,

00:00:18.850 --> 00:00:25.730
Villa's young pup jumped and boarded us most off us that did him on his head and scratched

00:00:25.730 --> 00:00:31.750
him behind that you and in the process revolted and encouraged this behavior.

00:00:31.750 --> 00:00:33.040
But now,

00:00:33.040 --> 00:00:36.850
when the fully grown talk dutifully jumps up to greet us,

00:00:36.850 --> 00:00:40.250
then it becomes an annoying situation for us,

00:00:40.250 --> 00:00:48.350
point licking and jumping all the friendly gestures that a dog exhibits to greet his own.

00:00:48.350 --> 00:00:49.350
No or guest.

00:00:49.350 --> 00:00:53.370
He probably jumps up to convey his message.

00:00:53.370 --> 00:00:54.350
Look at me.

00:00:54.350 --> 00:00:59.290
But when you push him off or did you let him get down?

00:00:59.290 --> 00:01:02.850
He does not realize that you are attempting to punish him.

00:01:02.850 --> 00:01:04.220
Instead,

00:01:04.220 --> 00:01:10.560
you're but may view your behaviors as exactly what he was seeking tragedy radiation from

00:01:10.560 --> 00:01:10.850
you.

00:01:10.850 --> 00:01:12.350
Thus,

00:01:12.350 --> 00:01:13.360
in this case,

00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.720
and he saw deputation he gets from you either negative or positive may be perceived as a

00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:20.350
revote,

00:01:20.350 --> 00:01:24.960
although jumping up is a natural behavior off dogs.

00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:27.350
It can cause problems for humans.

00:01:27.350 --> 00:01:31.890
When a dog jumps on a child or an elderly person,

00:01:31.890 --> 00:01:36.150
he could seriously injured them by knocking them down on the ground.

00:01:36.150 --> 00:01:39.510
Even small dogs can cause injuries.

00:01:39.510 --> 00:01:39.780
Well,

00:01:39.780 --> 00:01:46.850
jumping up an accident is scratching the person with the sharp nails because dogs naturally

00:01:46.850 --> 00:01:53.150
jump up on people and for me to they have to be taught that this behavior is unacceptable.

00:01:53.150 --> 00:01:59.780
Solely This behavioral problem requires both management off the situation and training off

00:01:59.780 --> 00:02:02.610
your dog first ofall,

00:02:02.610 --> 00:02:07.680
you should remember that your dogs jumping up is an attention seeking behavior,

00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:09.430
which is reinforced by you.

00:02:09.430 --> 00:02:11.680
Only therefore,

00:02:11.680 --> 00:02:16.850
then your dog jumps up in order to get your affection or anything off value.

00:02:16.850 --> 00:02:21.650
The first thing that you should do is to teach him to sit and stay.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:24.440
If your dog obeys your command,

00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:28.950
then also him a treat bought for sitting and for not jumping up.

00:02:28.950 --> 00:02:30.960
Additionally,

00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:37.360
keep things low key because too much excitement and affection from you may excite him as

00:02:37.360 --> 00:02:40.150
then on Mr Emulate him to jump up.

00:02:40.150 --> 00:02:41.950
Additionally,

00:02:41.950 --> 00:02:46.490
training should be practiced in a variety of locations throughout the home,

00:02:46.490 --> 00:02:48.480
including the front OVI.

00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.750
The place they're your dog normally greets people.

00:02:51.750 --> 00:02:56.670
Then you come back who instruct your dog to sit on.

00:02:56.670 --> 00:02:59.160
I don't know his meant and delay here,

00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:01.050
treating until he sits.

00:03:01.050 --> 00:03:03.610
It is It's on your command.

00:03:03.610 --> 00:03:04.460
Prison.

00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:07.450
Coddle him and offer him his favorite treats.

00:03:07.450 --> 00:03:09.650
If it does not sit,

00:03:09.650 --> 00:03:10.620
keep trying.

00:03:10.620 --> 00:03:11.380
Until this,

00:03:11.380 --> 00:03:13.700
so was the sickness.

00:03:13.700 --> 00:03:16.900
A training has been reliably achieved at the Doe V,

00:03:16.900 --> 00:03:19.020
with no people coming or going.

00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.750
It's time to start the practice with family members and then the guest visiting your home.

00:03:24.750 --> 00:03:28.610
This is very much required as a device.

00:03:28.610 --> 00:03:32.670
You don't Malone that it is unacceptable to jump up on you,

00:03:32.670 --> 00:03:38.050
but it is OK to jump up on everyone else involving other people.

00:03:38.050 --> 00:03:40.740
In this training teaches your dog there.

00:03:40.740 --> 00:03:43.560
Jumping up in general is unacceptable.

00:03:43.560 --> 00:03:45.750
No matter who comes into the house,

00:03:45.750 --> 00:03:48.900
make your dog sit and stay.

00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:54.910
Then these people enter your home and subsequently reward your dog with his favorite treats

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:54.910
.

00:03:54.910 --> 00:03:56.320
For his obedience,

00:03:56.320 --> 00:03:57.630
he said,

00:03:57.630 --> 00:03:59.880
gets up when someone arrives,

00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:05.210
then make him sit again and repeat this until he remains that'll throughout the whole

00:04:05.210 --> 00:04:06.450
arrival process.

00:04:06.450 --> 00:04:13.240
All visit know his unwanted behavior as soon as your dog jumps up on you,

00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.450
Don't your back trust your arms over your chest and don't make a sound.

00:04:18.450 --> 00:04:22.950
If they don't runs around to jump up again down the adobe,

00:04:22.950 --> 00:04:25.980
they for the dog to stop jumping.

00:04:25.980 --> 00:04:28.400
Another method off.

00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:31.250
Ignoring him is by walking away from him.

00:04:31.250 --> 00:04:33.490
If you don't jumps up,

00:04:33.490 --> 00:04:34.920
then you walk in the door.

00:04:34.920 --> 00:04:37.550
Don't alone and walk back outside.

00:04:37.550 --> 00:04:39.770
If it jumps up,

00:04:39.770 --> 00:04:41.060
then you are inside.

00:04:41.060 --> 00:04:42.450
Walk out of the room,

00:04:42.450 --> 00:04:44.490
the movement,

00:04:44.490 --> 00:04:46.250
and then step back inside.

00:04:46.250 --> 00:04:49.750
Repeat this until your dog constable.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.870
If you're Doc succeeding,

00:04:51.870 --> 00:04:56.850
getting any attention for the jumping behavior that he will continue to jump,

00:04:56.850 --> 00:05:04.240
attention may include petting him and pushing him of the All of this can be seen forcing

00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:06.750
for the dog that wants your attention.

00:05:06.750 --> 00:05:09.220
To change this behavior,

00:05:09.220 --> 00:05:12.250
you need to remove all such reinforcements.

00:05:12.250 --> 00:05:14.040
Don't look.

00:05:14.040 --> 00:05:18.330
Speak that are interact with him in any possible way.

00:05:18.330 --> 00:05:19.650
Very jumps on you.

00:05:19.650 --> 00:05:22.480
Give him the commander sit,

00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.350
but do not interact with him.

00:05:24.350 --> 00:05:27.850
This would likely beat him not to jump on you.

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:34.350
Those also have a habit to jump on strangers during their walk because of the excitement to

00:05:34.350 --> 00:05:35.050
meet them.

00:05:35.050 --> 00:05:37.140
As a parent,

00:05:37.140 --> 00:05:39.060
you need to train your dog.

00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:39.400
No,

00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:42.880
to jump on strangers is then for this.

00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:45.720
Ask your friends to walk on the same track.

00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:51.960
There you are going to take your dog for a voke after encountering your friends very tries

00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:53.380
to jump upon them.

00:05:53.380 --> 00:05:54.850
Instruct him to sit.

00:05:54.850 --> 00:06:01.140
If it's it's prison and revolting with treats in this fashion,

00:06:01.140 --> 00:06:04.110
he will know not to jump on strangers,

00:06:04.110 --> 00:06:08.750
and he will understand that he will get treats only when he sits Cumbie.

00:06:08.750 --> 00:06:12.240
In all of these training exercises,

00:06:12.240 --> 00:06:15.150
the most crucial thing is consistency.

00:06:15.150 --> 00:06:21.050
Everyone in your family must follow this training program at all the times.

00:06:21.050 --> 00:06:26.020
You can't let you doctor jump on people in some circumstances,

00:06:26.020 --> 00:06:27.450
but not in others.

00:06:27.450 --> 00:06:34.520
This inconsistency metrical confusion and anxiety in your dog and maybe even make your

00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:36.150
training ineffective.

00:06:36.150 --> 00:06:38.080
Therefore,

00:06:38.080 --> 00:06:42.590
being consistent is very much required to correct your dog behavior.

00:06:42.590 --> 00:06:45.410
Last but not the least.

00:06:45.410 --> 00:06:48.650
Never punish your dog for his unwanted behavior.

00:06:48.650 --> 00:06:52.990
Physical punishment will for the reinforced this behavior,

00:06:52.990 --> 00:06:54.860
for instance.

00:06:54.860 --> 00:06:58.530
Then he jumps on you and you try to push him of it.

00:06:58.530 --> 00:07:02.450
He may interpret this as you're way off initiating the plate.

00:07:02.450 --> 00:07:09.740
Your dog's response will likely be the jump again to continue the game because you have

00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:12.950
actually reinforce that behaviour you were trying to stop.

00:07:12.950 --> 00:07:14.910
Additionally,

00:07:14.910 --> 00:07:20.600
physical punishment can make him afraid off you and can even damaged the born shared by you

00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.540
and your dog.
