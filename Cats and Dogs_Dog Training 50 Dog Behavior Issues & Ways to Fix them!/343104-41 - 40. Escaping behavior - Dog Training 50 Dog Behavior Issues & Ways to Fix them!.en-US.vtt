00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
many off,

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:05.260
you would have observed dogs running away from their homes in your neighborhood,

00:00:05.260 --> 00:00:10.580
and many off you would have come across posts on social media about missing does.

00:00:10.580 --> 00:00:17.710
It's a very sad state for the back parents as well as the dog when such a thing happens in

00:00:17.710 --> 00:00:18.720
such cases,

00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:21.120
while many dogs are found pretty quickly,

00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:24.080
but unfortunately some never come back home.

00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:29.860
There are various reasons because of which a dogma try to escape and then away from his

00:00:29.860 --> 00:00:30.150
home,

00:00:30.150 --> 00:00:35.540
and understanding these reasons may help you to prevent euphoric it from escaping.

00:00:35.540 --> 00:00:38.150
In case he has such tendencies.

00:00:38.150 --> 00:00:42.650
The first isn't for his escaping behavior can be his boredom.

00:00:42.650 --> 00:00:47.610
This is only happens if you leave him alone at home for longer durations,

00:00:47.610 --> 00:00:53.200
and he has nothing in his environment that can keep him engaged in such a scenario.

00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.560
Just like you want.

00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:57.340
Want to sit in a room all day with nothing to do?

00:00:57.340 --> 00:00:58.740
Neither does your dog,

00:00:58.740 --> 00:01:03.550
and therefore he might try to run away to find other does to play it.

00:01:03.550 --> 00:01:09.050
Separation anxiety can also be a reason for your dogs escapist behaviour.

00:01:09.050 --> 00:01:15.350
Your dog loves your load and therefore staying away from you Mixing anxious and stressed.

00:01:15.350 --> 00:01:18.640
If your dog is suffering from separation anxiety,

00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:19.820
he may back,

00:01:19.820 --> 00:01:20.500
cry,

00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:23.650
whine and destroy things to call you back home.

00:01:23.650 --> 00:01:25.140
Besides,

00:01:25.140 --> 00:01:27.020
if he finds an opportunity,

00:01:27.020 --> 00:01:32.580
he will even done away with the intention to find you and bring you back home intact.

00:01:32.580 --> 00:01:35.970
Males and females may have strong urges at times,

00:01:35.970 --> 00:01:39.250
and they may escape in order to find a potential mate.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.090
For instance,

00:01:41.090 --> 00:01:45.620
if there is a female dog in heat hanging outside your home and you intact mill,

00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:50.050
Doc senses it the US to meet who make him to escape from your home.

00:01:50.050 --> 00:01:53.930
You may be very excited about moving to your new home,

00:01:53.930 --> 00:01:56.750
but probably you push doesn't feel the same way.

00:01:56.750 --> 00:02:00.250
Moving to a new place can be stressful for your door.

00:02:00.250 --> 00:02:01.330
To him,

00:02:01.330 --> 00:02:04.350
a new home means that everything family is gone.

00:02:04.350 --> 00:02:08.550
So when the humans are busy settling into their new house,

00:02:08.550 --> 00:02:13.930
it isn't uncommon to hear that their put escaped in such cases.

00:02:13.930 --> 00:02:14.470
Dogs,

00:02:14.470 --> 00:02:18.310
then away from the new house trying to find their way back to the world,

00:02:18.310 --> 00:02:21.840
said a loud noises like those off fireworks,

00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:27.390
loud noises off big machineries at turned system or maybe even a house party can fight and

00:02:27.390 --> 00:02:28.240
you're happy dog.

00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:30.080
What's fun for us?

00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:33.150
Humans can be very scary sight for adults.

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:37.620
This fear can cause an otherwise well behaved dog who saddle you,

00:02:37.620 --> 00:02:42.350
try and run away from his home with the intention who escaped from what is threatening.

00:02:42.350 --> 00:02:44.190
Using pay,

00:02:44.190 --> 00:02:48.550
which is a natural instinct off a dog may also trigger him to run away from his home.

00:02:48.550 --> 00:02:54.410
If your dog happens to sport a school or cat through the window human away in order to

00:02:54.410 --> 00:02:54.970
taste that.

00:02:54.970 --> 00:03:00.530
One of the other common reason for dogs running away from their homes is the easy

00:03:00.530 --> 00:03:02.150
availability of escape groups.

00:03:02.150 --> 00:03:04.770
Dogs are curious creatures,

00:03:04.770 --> 00:03:08.750
and it is the natural behaviour dome and explored the surroundings.

00:03:08.750 --> 00:03:12.850
So if you have a fence that is too low but again that is broken,

00:03:12.850 --> 00:03:14.650
what have you know that it's open?

00:03:14.650 --> 00:03:18.640
There are good chances that you don't might escape just for exploring.

00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:23.780
Here are the precautionary measures that you can take to prevent your dog from running away

00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:24.450
from your home.

00:03:24.450 --> 00:03:26.510
Before leaving home,

00:03:26.510 --> 00:03:28.850
make sure to take him for a long walk.

00:03:28.850 --> 00:03:30.680
In addition to this,

00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:34.950
consider playing a giant games like Frisbee or to go forward with him.

00:03:34.950 --> 00:03:38.450
The goal here is to tire out your dog before leaving.

00:03:38.450 --> 00:03:40.800
With all his energy expended,

00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:44.620
he won't indulge in destructive activities caused because of separation.

00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:50.290
Anxiety in your absence make provision for keeping your dog engaged when he is alone at

00:03:50.290 --> 00:03:50.550
home.

00:03:50.550 --> 00:03:55.880
A lonely look is more likely to get boat whenever you have to leave him alone at home,

00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:58.750
providing plenty of toys and food puzzle games.

00:03:58.750 --> 00:04:01.780
This will not only keep him engaged,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:07.880
but we also stimulated mentally and physically at least nearly people not ending his toys

00:04:07.880 --> 00:04:09.850
so as to keep him interested in them.

00:04:09.850 --> 00:04:12.140
Consider spaying your dog,

00:04:12.140 --> 00:04:14.670
as this will control is us to meet,

00:04:14.670 --> 00:04:18.150
which is also one of the reasons for him to run away from your home.

00:04:18.150 --> 00:04:20.680
We had a safe space for your doctor.

00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:26.180
Retreat like a great or a quiet corner off a room where he can hide when you get scared of

00:04:26.180 --> 00:04:27.100
the loud noises,

00:04:27.100 --> 00:04:29.050
off turn systems or five acres.

00:04:29.050 --> 00:04:31.130
Additionally,

00:04:31.130 --> 00:04:36.150
make sure that all doors and windows are lote so that there is no room for him to escape.

00:04:36.150 --> 00:04:42.320
Make sure that your dog is microchipped and the always veers a cooler with your name,

00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:42.850
contact,

00:04:42.850 --> 00:04:44.750
number and address written on it.

00:04:44.750 --> 00:04:47.060
In case you don't get lost,

00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:50.150
it would be easy for the person who finds him to contact you.

00:04:50.150 --> 00:04:55.550
Some does come back after the escape because there's a good reason for them to come home.

00:04:55.550 --> 00:04:59.340
So if you don't escapes and then comes back home,

00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:01.650
keep it in your mind to now repetition.

00:05:01.650 --> 00:05:03.760
Because if you punish him,

00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:05.300
he will start associating,

00:05:05.300 --> 00:05:07.050
coming that negative things.

00:05:07.050 --> 00:05:12.650
Getting punished is not a great incentive for him to come back in case he lands of it.

00:05:12.650 --> 00:05:14.210
Therefore,

00:05:14.210 --> 00:05:18.450
in case your dog runs away from home but comes back to you after some time,

00:05:18.450 --> 00:05:20.080
show him your affection,

00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:22.950
my card linking and feeling in his favorite treats.

00:05:22.950 --> 00:05:25.110
In such a scenario,

00:05:25.110 --> 00:05:27.060
even if you don't happen student away,

00:05:27.060 --> 00:05:27.850
for some reason,

00:05:27.850 --> 00:05:31.150
he will definitely remember his favorite treats and you love,

00:05:31.150 --> 00:05:34.550
and there are very high chances that he will come back to you
