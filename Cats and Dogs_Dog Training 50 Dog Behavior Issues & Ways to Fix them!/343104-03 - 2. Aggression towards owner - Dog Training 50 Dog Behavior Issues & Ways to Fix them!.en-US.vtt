00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.400
if your dog suddenly starts showing aggression towards you or starts biting your family

00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:06.060
members,

00:00:06.060 --> 00:00:11.700
it is perhaps one of the most serious problems to live it in such a situation.

00:00:11.700 --> 00:00:12.800
On one hand,

00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:16.070
you're constantly worried about the risk you and your family are.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:16.550
Yet,

00:00:16.550 --> 00:00:18.090
while on the other hand,

00:00:18.090 --> 00:00:24.020
it becomes quite difficult for you to accept and understand why a dog that is loved and

00:00:24.020 --> 00:00:26.150
well cared for starts behaving this week.

00:00:26.150 --> 00:00:32.030
There are a few particular scenarios in which dogs become aggressive towards their owner

00:00:32.030 --> 00:00:33.390
and other family or people.

00:00:33.390 --> 00:00:38.450
The most common trigger for this kind of dog aggression is the fear off their owner.

00:00:38.450 --> 00:00:44.720
This is entirely observed in those cases where an owner punishes dog excessively in order

00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:45.850
to correct his behavior.

00:00:45.850 --> 00:00:47.560
However,

00:00:47.560 --> 00:00:51.460
how shall punishments like hitting the dog shouting at him,

00:00:51.460 --> 00:00:55.250
grabbing him etcetera may make the dog fearful of you.

00:00:55.250 --> 00:00:56.640
Moreover,

00:00:56.640 --> 00:00:58.700
these punishments cause pain to him,

00:00:58.700 --> 00:01:01.750
which in turn triggers defensive behaviour in the door.

00:01:01.750 --> 00:01:08.140
The probability often event of aggression increases if these type of punishments are given

00:01:08.140 --> 00:01:13.670
at an inappropriate time and are inconsistent because of this inconsistency in the

00:01:13.670 --> 00:01:14.330
punishment,

00:01:14.330 --> 00:01:16.130
that dog gets confused,

00:01:16.130 --> 00:01:18.500
which in turn makes him unpredictable,

00:01:18.500 --> 00:01:21.650
as you can now see that the dog is,

00:01:21.650 --> 00:01:28.150
in fact reacting to what he sees as an unpredictable behavior by his human and is only

00:01:28.150 --> 00:01:32.850
doing what he feels is necessity to protect himself from the anticipated punishment.

00:01:32.850 --> 00:01:34.840
Occasionally,

00:01:34.840 --> 00:01:40.220
a dog may become aggressive towards his owner when he is groomed or is handled in a way

00:01:40.220 --> 00:01:42.050
that makes him uncomfortable,

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:44.080
inset scenarios.

00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:48.250
That dog starts forming negative association with grooming or handling by his owner.

00:01:48.250 --> 00:01:54.350
Sometimes the way his human family handles him can also seem intimidating to him,

00:01:54.350 --> 00:01:56.400
even if it is not intended to be,

00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:57.870
for example,

00:01:57.870 --> 00:01:59.810
does gently threatened eater,

00:01:59.810 --> 00:02:00.050
though,

00:02:00.050 --> 00:02:02.950
by putting their head over other dog's neck.

00:02:02.950 --> 00:02:04.110
So,

00:02:04.110 --> 00:02:05.120
quite naturally,

00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:09.800
our human touching the back off a dog's neck can be perceived as a threat by him.

00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:11.450
Additionally,

00:02:11.450 --> 00:02:15.950
some jokes simply don't like being touched on certain parts of their body,

00:02:15.950 --> 00:02:18.350
such as their feet under their tape.

00:02:18.350 --> 00:02:24.150
But if an honor that is him on such areas where he doesn't feel comfortable,

00:02:24.150 --> 00:02:26.250
it can provoke aggression in the door.

00:02:26.250 --> 00:02:32.080
Another reason for the aggressive behavior off a dog towards his owner can be is medical

00:02:32.080 --> 00:02:32.710
illness.

00:02:32.710 --> 00:02:38.830
If you're otherwise family dog suddenly start snapping or biting you when you try to touch

00:02:38.830 --> 00:02:39.050
him.

00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.750
What starts barking at you when you approach him?

00:02:41.750 --> 00:02:44.850
Then he's likely going through some major P.

00:02:44.850 --> 00:02:51.070
Accidentally putting pressure or touching the ailing part off your dog can cause in raping

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:51.070
,

00:02:51.070 --> 00:02:52.110
and he can,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:52.800
instinctively,

00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:56.150
by two to stop you from touching that particular area.

00:02:56.150 --> 00:03:00.950
In case you're facing or fear such an issue in the future,

00:03:00.950 --> 00:03:03.540
the adore becomes aggressive towards you.

00:03:03.540 --> 00:03:05.890

00:03:05.890 --> 00:03:12.540
The first and the foremost step is to consult your vet immediately to rule out any signs

00:03:12.540 --> 00:03:14.150

00:03:14.150 --> 00:03:17.100
Never physically punish a dog,

00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:19.150
as it may instill fear in him.

00:03:19.150 --> 00:03:22.110
If he performs any unwanted behavior,

00:03:22.110 --> 00:03:23.950
ignore him and leave the room.

00:03:23.950 --> 00:03:28.750
This will teach him that unwanted behavior is not acceptable.

00:03:28.750 --> 00:03:33.450
Try to observe and make a mental note off those areas.

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:35.850

those areas like his feet for examination.

00:03:45.850 --> 00:03:51.930
Then slowly desensitize him with your touch and reward him with treats whenever he allows

00:03:51.930 --> 00:03:52.650
you to touch him.

00:03:52.650 --> 00:03:55.300
If nothing off this works,

00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:58.450
it is recommended to consult a canine behaviorist.
