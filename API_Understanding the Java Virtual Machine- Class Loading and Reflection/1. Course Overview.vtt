Hi everyone.

2
00:00:07.230 --> 00:00:08.900
My name is Kevin Jones.

3
00:00:08.900 --> 00:00:10.270
Welcome to my course,

4
00:00:10.270 --> 00:00:15.130
Understanding the Java Virtual Machine: Class Loading and Reflection.

5
00:00:15.130 --> 00:00:17.360
I'm a developer and owner at Rock Solid Knowledge,

6
00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:21.840
a software development company based in the United Kingdom.

7
00:00:21.840 --> 00:00:24.460
If you want to understand how the JVM works,

8
00:00:24.460 --> 00:00:27.190
you need to understand how the class loader works.

9
00:00:27.190 --> 00:00:30.050
It is at the core of everything you do in Java.

10
00:00:30.050 --> 00:00:33.660
If you've ever hit NoClassDefFoundErrors or wondered how

11
00:00:33.660 --> 00:00:36.860
your favorite web server is able to reload your classes,

12
00:00:36.860 --> 00:00:39.540
then this is the course for you.

13
00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:43.340
Do you want to know what reflection is and how IOC containers work, then we

14
00:00:43.340 --> 00:00:47.780
explain that here and build a lightweight IOC container example to examine

15
00:00:47.780 --> 00:00:53.220
these topics in depth. Some of the major topics that we'll cover include,

16
00:00:53.220 --> 00:00:58.270
understanding class loader delegation, learn how to use the URL ClassLoader

17
00:00:58.270 --> 00:01:03.060
to provide class loading separation in space and time, create your own class

18
00:01:03.060 --> 00:01:06.910
loader to load classes from a database, use reflection to create and

19
00:01:06.910 --> 00:01:11.280
initialize objects, on build a simple IOC container to show the power of

20
00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.630
reflection. By the end of this course, you'll understand how powerful class

21
00:01:16.630 --> 00:01:22.020
loading is and how it's used to fill many parts of the Java ecosystem. You'll

22
00:01:22.020 --> 00:01:25.740
also see how reflection is used in the tooling and applications that you use

23
00:01:25.740 --> 00:01:30.470
to build and run your own Java code. Before beginning the course, you should

24
00:01:30.470 --> 00:01:32.860
be familiar with the Java language.

25
00:01:32.860 --> 00:01:36.460
I hope you'll join me on this journey to understanding class loading and

26
00:01:36.460 --> 00:01:47.000
reflection with the Understanding the Java Virtual Machine: Class Loading and Reflection course, at Pluralsight.
