Hi.

2
00:00:03,140 --> 00:00:06,240
My name is Kevin Jones from Pluralsight,

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,950
and this is the Hot Deployment module from the Java Virtual

4
00:00:09,950 --> 00:00:14,770
Machine: Class Loading and Reflection class. In this module,

5
00:00:14,770 --> 00:00:18,320
we'll take a look at how class loaders can give us the ability

6
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,040
to reload classes dynamically.

7
00:00:21,040 --> 00:00:23,490
This means that we can, for example,

8
00:00:23,490 --> 00:00:28,070
ship new code to an application and have that application load that new

9
00:00:28,070 --> 00:00:32,140
code without having to fully reload the application.

10
00:00:32,140 --> 00:00:34,440
This is the sort of thing that web servers do.

11
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,100
So, for example, Tomcat, if you ship a new version of a server into Tomcat,

12
00:00:39,100 --> 00:00:43,050
we don't need to reload Tomcat. Tomcat just detects that this

13
00:00:43,050 --> 00:00:46,440
new version of the server that shipped and is able to reload all

14
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:49,200
the classes that make up that particular application, that

15
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:58,000
particular web application. This gives us great flexibility in the way we can configure our applications.
