00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.470
in this lecture,

00:00:01.470 --> 00:00:05.370
let's tow the installation off mongo db on our local machine.

00:00:05.370 --> 00:00:08.070
The installation on Windows Mac,

00:00:08.070 --> 00:00:09.120
where's our Lennox?

00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:12.030
Will remain the same because when we don't Lord,

00:00:12.030 --> 00:00:13.030
we get a ZIP file.

00:00:13.030 --> 00:00:14.270
All we have to do is tow.

00:00:14.270 --> 00:00:15.510
Unzip that file in,

00:00:15.510 --> 00:00:20.780
tow some location and make sure that our Mongo DB commands are in the pot.

00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:22.380
In the later sections.

00:00:22.380 --> 00:00:25.910
We will also start working with Mongo DB on the clothes.

00:00:25.910 --> 00:00:27.210
But for now,

00:00:27.210 --> 00:00:29.800
to make ourselves comfortable with among would be command,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:33.300
let's have a local copy off Mongo db two.

00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:35.280
Don't load mongo db first with it.

00:00:35.280 --> 00:00:37.110
Mongo db dot com in a browser.

00:00:37.110 --> 00:00:37.420
And then,

00:00:37.420 --> 00:00:38.980
if you go to the home page here,

00:00:38.980 --> 00:00:41.110
you can see that there is a software section.

00:00:41.110 --> 00:00:44.580
It says communities are world that is also an end to place their work.

00:00:44.580 --> 00:00:46.250
This is basically commercial.

00:00:46.250 --> 00:00:51.820
We will don't let the community server clicking on which it will take me toe a page where

00:00:51.820 --> 00:00:53.250
you can choose the downloads.

00:00:53.250 --> 00:00:56.220
As you can see that there is a current question,

00:00:56.220 --> 00:00:57.690
which is four door to door seven.

00:00:57.690 --> 00:01:00.470
You can choose older Russians if you want,

00:01:00.470 --> 00:01:02.210
as well as the platform,

00:01:02.210 --> 00:01:04.390
which automatically has been detected here.

00:01:04.390 --> 00:01:05.280
And then,

00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:05.670
of course,

00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:07.360
what kindof download you want?

00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.240
So if you're selected,

00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:10.030
Windows probably would have got a mess.

00:01:10.030 --> 00:01:11.620
I are probably a zip file.

00:01:11.620 --> 00:01:13.290
I click on download.

00:01:13.290 --> 00:01:15.630
I'm going to keep it on my desktop.

00:01:15.630 --> 00:01:18.260
So once the download is done,

00:01:18.260 --> 00:01:27.620
let's open the same thing in Finder and unzip the file Instead of keeping the binary files

00:01:27.620 --> 00:01:28.330
on desktop,

00:01:28.330 --> 00:01:30.220
I would like to keep it on my home directory,

00:01:30.220 --> 00:01:34.790
so I'm gonna drag this and then drop it on toe the home directory here.

00:01:34.790 --> 00:01:39.980
And then I have to ensure that the Mongo DB Bin directory,

00:01:39.980 --> 00:01:41.850
which contains all the executable,

00:01:41.850 --> 00:01:43.650
is in my part.

00:01:43.650 --> 00:01:46.560
This varies from operating system toe operating system.

00:01:46.560 --> 00:01:47.080
However,

00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:48.940
if you don't want to set this part,

00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:49.530
no problem.

00:01:49.530 --> 00:01:52.650
You can still run the command from the BIN directory itself.

00:01:52.650 --> 00:01:54.120
And inside the BIN directory,

00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:55.870
you can see there are some executable.

00:01:55.870 --> 00:01:58.140
The one that represents the server.

00:01:58.140 --> 00:02:00.480
Is this mongo D on Windows L.

00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:02.220
A mongo did r E x e.

00:02:02.220 --> 00:02:03.740
By double clicking this,

00:02:03.740 --> 00:02:05.260
you may start the server.

00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:05.770
However,

00:02:05.770 --> 00:02:11.690
it looks for a specific folder called DB slash data in your installation drive.

00:02:11.690 --> 00:02:12.700
However,

00:02:12.700 --> 00:02:18.030
I can also run this from a command front and then supply that option manually.

00:02:18.030 --> 00:02:20.180
Once the server is up and running,

00:02:20.180 --> 00:02:23.040
there is no security enabled By default,

00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.940
you can connect to your server,

00:02:24.940 --> 00:02:31.390
which is running in 27017 port and to connect to the database and issue some commands,

00:02:31.390 --> 00:02:33.600
we can use this mongo as a shell.

00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:35.150
This is a client.

00:02:35.150 --> 00:02:37.240
Instead of using this mongo shell,

00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:42.870
we will be writing a nest application toe store the true and manipulate data on the mongo

00:02:42.870 --> 00:02:43.650
DB settlers.

00:02:43.650 --> 00:02:50.270
So let's go open a terminal verified a mongo DB insulation also start among go to be server

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:50.270
.

00:02:50.270 --> 00:02:51.860
Before doing that,

00:02:51.860 --> 00:02:54.760
let's also create a folder on our desktop.

00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:57.030
You can keep the folder anywhere you want.

00:02:57.030 --> 00:03:02.490
You need to create a folder that has all the data that gets created when you are servant is

00:03:02.490 --> 00:03:03.150
up and running.

00:03:03.150 --> 00:03:07.870
So I'm gonna pierre a new folder over here on the name of the folder.

00:03:07.870 --> 00:03:11.150
I'm going to give it as mongo db dash data.

00:03:11.150 --> 00:03:13.400
You can name it anything you want.

00:03:13.400 --> 00:03:15.360
Let me open a terminal on,

00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:16.680
then seed in tow.

00:03:16.680 --> 00:03:22.910
Mongo db installation folder that contains a been directly that consists off all the

00:03:22.910 --> 00:03:23.830
executive ALS.

00:03:23.830 --> 00:03:25.160
So I'll say Siri been.

00:03:25.160 --> 00:03:27.520
And then if you check the content,

00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:29.950
you'll see that all the executable czar over here,

00:03:29.950 --> 00:03:31.430
As I mentioned earlier,

00:03:31.430 --> 00:03:33.450
we have to run this Mongol de Command,

00:03:33.450 --> 00:03:39.350
which starts the server at Port Number 27017 But we may have to specify the name of the

00:03:39.350 --> 00:03:39.780
folder,

00:03:39.780 --> 00:03:42.870
which is going to be used for storing all our data.

00:03:42.870 --> 00:03:47.290
So let's clear the screen and take the command mongo D Dash.

00:03:47.290 --> 00:03:52.250
There's Devi Pot and then the name off the folder so I can give either an absolute part on

00:03:52.250 --> 00:03:53.050
a religion pot.

00:03:53.050 --> 00:03:59.950
Let me give the absolute part as slash users slash we not come out slash desktop and then

00:03:59.950 --> 00:04:03.340
slash mongo db Dash data I pressed.

00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:04.320
Enter on.

00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:10.020
You can see that disorder War is up and running To verify whether the Sarwar has started

00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:11.040
properly or not,

00:04:11.040 --> 00:04:17.980
we can open another tab by pressing community and now issued a command mongo,

00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:21.690
which will try to connect to the Mongo DB Server once again.

00:04:21.690 --> 00:04:23.480
If you look at my world military,

00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:28.890
I'm already in the BIN directory right now and now I can type your mongo and then press

00:04:28.890 --> 00:04:29.550
enter.

00:04:29.550 --> 00:04:30.680
This is gonna buy,

00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.210
therefore connect toe the local host to 7017 But during the start up of the server,

00:04:36.210 --> 00:04:37.750
have you given a different port number?

00:04:37.750 --> 00:04:39.120
You can specify that also,

00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.100
by typing dash,

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:44.850
dash sport and then a different port number by the four little also connected DB called the

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:45.450
test.

00:04:45.450 --> 00:04:47.550
But if you want to connect your different database,

00:04:47.550 --> 00:04:49.510
you can give the name of that d be as well.

00:04:49.510 --> 00:04:54.370
But since we don't loaded the Mongo DB just now and then started the server,

00:04:54.370 --> 00:04:56.250
we don't have any data basis.

00:04:56.250 --> 00:04:58.920
So let's simply press mongo and press enter.

00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:03.300
See what happens on Mac OS if you get this particular dialog box.

00:05:03.300 --> 00:05:03.480
That,

00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:04.450
says Mongo,

00:05:04.450 --> 00:05:07.940
cannot be open because developer cannot be verified on.

00:05:07.940 --> 00:05:12.320
This is mainly because McElroy's is trained to validate the one that you downloaded from

00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:13.210
the Internet,

00:05:13.210 --> 00:05:14.750
not from the APP store.

00:05:14.750 --> 00:05:18.270
So what you can do for that is cancelled for no on,

00:05:18.270 --> 00:05:23.210
then goto system preferences under security and privacy.

00:05:23.210 --> 00:05:29.260
It is telling me that Mongo was blocked from use because it is not from an identified

00:05:29.260 --> 00:05:29.730
developer.

00:05:29.730 --> 00:05:30.650
So that's OK.

00:05:30.650 --> 00:05:32.840
You can simply click on a low Anyway.

00:05:32.840 --> 00:05:34.120
Close this on.

00:05:34.120 --> 00:05:36.880
Go back over here and then type the command mongo once again.

00:05:36.880 --> 00:05:37.970
You can see that now.

00:05:37.970 --> 00:05:39.460
It came up with a different dialect boats.

00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:42.060
It says that Macron's cannot verify the developer off.

00:05:42.060 --> 00:05:42.630
Mongo.

00:05:42.630 --> 00:05:44.140
Are you sure you want to open it?

00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:44.970
I'd say open.

00:05:44.970 --> 00:05:46.890
And now it's gonna connect on.

00:05:46.890 --> 00:05:48.650
You should see a farmed.

00:05:48.650 --> 00:05:53.130
You can clear the screen by pressing control and l on Mac OS,

00:05:53.130 --> 00:05:55.250
and then you can now type mongo.

00:05:55.250 --> 00:05:55.960
DB commits.

00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.110
No,

00:05:56.110 --> 00:05:58.630
this is not your UNIX comments over here.

00:05:58.630 --> 00:05:59.980
Now it's a mongo.

00:05:59.980 --> 00:06:00.730
To Michelle,

00:06:00.730 --> 00:06:02.100
it is typically like a job,

00:06:02.100 --> 00:06:05.180
a structure many of the Java scripts commands work like,

00:06:05.180 --> 00:06:05.710
for example,

00:06:05.710 --> 00:06:06.940
I can declare a variable.

00:06:06.940 --> 00:06:08.790
I can run a far look over here,

00:06:08.790 --> 00:06:09.940
however,

00:06:09.940 --> 00:06:12.430
I'm more interested in the Mongo DB Command,

00:06:12.430 --> 00:06:16.700
and the only command I want to see right now is show DBS on.

00:06:16.700 --> 00:06:19.110
That's basically like shoulder data basis,

00:06:19.110 --> 00:06:24.560
and you can see that there are three databases called Item in Conflict local by default.

00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:25.830
In the next lecture,

00:06:25.830 --> 00:06:31.020
let's discuss about most commonly used commands and make ourselves comfortable with the

00:06:31.020 --> 00:06:31.950
Mongo Division
