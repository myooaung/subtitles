00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.210
in this lecture.

00:00:01.210 --> 00:00:05.250
Let's create a class that represents our contact object.

00:00:05.250 --> 00:00:07.470
There are two reasons why we're doing this.

00:00:07.470 --> 00:00:10.040
Number one is for validation Purposes.

00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:16.120
When the user sends a post are put to request the paler can be validated against this

00:00:16.120 --> 00:00:16.660
contact.

00:00:16.660 --> 00:00:17.170
Plus,

00:00:17.170 --> 00:00:21.130
as a less mang goes requires to work with a schema.

00:00:21.130 --> 00:00:24.780
We can use the same class and provide that as a schema.

00:00:24.780 --> 00:00:25.420
Now,

00:00:25.420 --> 00:00:31.420
with the steam on among those can power operations such as save or find etcetera.

00:00:31.420 --> 00:00:33.890
So let's go clear our contact model.

00:00:33.890 --> 00:00:34.470
Plus,

00:00:34.470 --> 00:00:40.230
I'm going to right click on the contacts folder over here and then a new file on the name

00:00:40.230 --> 00:00:40.660
of the file.

00:00:40.660 --> 00:00:44.820
I'm gonna give it us contact dot schema dot ts.

00:00:44.820 --> 00:00:47.750
The name of the file itself can be anything you want,

00:00:47.750 --> 00:00:52.520
but so make sure that we understand that this is a skim off while we're gonna give the name

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:56.710
s contact our schema tortillas on Ala Moana Tory's tow export.

00:00:56.710 --> 00:00:59.220
A class here called contact.

00:00:59.220 --> 00:01:03.630
Unlike the previous examples were only name and email be used.

00:01:03.630 --> 00:01:04.260
This time,

00:01:04.260 --> 00:01:06.550
we will also make it little bit elaborate.

00:01:06.550 --> 00:01:09.630
So we'll clear the name off type string.

00:01:09.630 --> 00:01:12.790
We're gonna have another email we're gonna have.

00:01:12.790 --> 00:01:13.930
The phone number,

00:01:13.930 --> 00:01:15.730
which is all going to be a string type,

00:01:15.730 --> 00:01:20.120
will also have city off type string state again,

00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.080
off string and then country off course.

00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:24.550
That is also going to be a string.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:25.560
However,

00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:30.990
we also want toe ensure that the user enters proper data for each one off them.

00:01:30.990 --> 00:01:34.470
So I'm gonna add some decorators here first,

00:01:34.470 --> 00:01:36.790
let's at a empty import statement.

00:01:36.790 --> 00:01:41.540
So it's a import empty calibrated from class validator.

00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.780
Now the reason why I do this is whenever I had a decorator,

00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.210
it'll automatically be taken from here,

00:01:48.210 --> 00:01:49.200
for example,

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.880
for the name and email.

00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:53.060
I want this to be a mandatory one,

00:01:53.060 --> 00:01:55.350
so I should say that they should not be empty.

00:01:55.350 --> 00:02:00.850
I can see here at the rate is not empty on Not that automatically.

00:02:00.850 --> 00:02:02.650
It went inside this bracket.

00:02:02.650 --> 00:02:03.680
Likewise,

00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:09.460
I also want to say that the length of the name minimum three letters maximum 25 letters.

00:02:09.460 --> 00:02:12.830
I'll say underrate lent in bracket.

00:02:12.830 --> 00:02:14.140
I need to give the minimum,

00:02:14.140 --> 00:02:16.250
which is three maximum 25.

00:02:16.250 --> 00:02:17.210
As for US,

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:18.170
email is concerned.

00:02:18.170 --> 00:02:26.130
We can say here at the rate is email and we'll also say at the rate is not empty for four

00:02:26.130 --> 00:02:26.650
number.

00:02:26.650 --> 00:02:31.160
We can always stay here at the rate is phone number and in case,

00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:33.150
if you want to restrict the user toe,

00:02:33.150 --> 00:02:34.760
enter the country core.

00:02:34.760 --> 00:02:37.160
You can put a region as that said,

00:02:37.160 --> 00:02:41.900
This will ensure that the user has passed the country court along with the phone number.

00:02:41.900 --> 00:02:42.650
Once again.

00:02:42.650 --> 00:02:44.310
If this is a mandatory field,

00:02:44.310 --> 00:02:49.480
you can always say here at the rate is not empty for city,

00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:50.470
state country.

00:02:50.470 --> 00:02:52.750
I don't really want to do any validations.

00:02:52.750 --> 00:02:59.140
So the first part off this model plants is really the second part of this model classes,

00:02:59.140 --> 00:03:05.250
where I want to make it off this contract loss as among goes schema so that I can perform

00:03:05.250 --> 00:03:06.850
the crowd operations using that.

00:03:06.850 --> 00:03:07.970
To do that,

00:03:07.970 --> 00:03:09.630
I can make it off some decorators,

00:03:09.630 --> 00:03:13.110
probably by next Js Mongols as a less mangoes.

00:03:13.110 --> 00:03:14.860
Let me add that over here,

00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:22.940
I'm gonna add import an empty curly bracket from a drape nets Js slash mangoes and then

00:03:22.940 --> 00:03:28.620
another one import an empty curly bracket from moderate mangoes itself and from mangoes,

00:03:28.620 --> 00:03:34.810
we want toe use a class called document for which this class after the subclass.

00:03:34.810 --> 00:03:39.050
So I'm gonna go on type your extents document.

00:03:39.050 --> 00:03:40.940
The import did not come here,

00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:42.380
so let's manually add that.

00:03:42.380 --> 00:03:47.950
And then we need to decorate this using other it schema.

00:03:47.950 --> 00:03:49.210
Next.

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:52.810
We also have to tell which off these fields represent.

00:03:52.810 --> 00:03:53.240
Mongo,

00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:58.250
db schema properties nothing but the properties off a mongo DB document.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:03:59.480
And in my case,

00:03:59.480 --> 00:04:00.740
all of these are property.

00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:02.760
So allowed are a decorator,

00:04:02.760 --> 00:04:13.410
Your advocate drop like this and copy this and paste for each off these and one last thing

00:04:13.410 --> 00:04:18.890
we have to do is to create a schema using this particular class definition and then export

00:04:18.890 --> 00:04:20.200
the same to do that.

00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:23.380
Let's come down here and say export Const.

00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.800
On the name you can give anything you want,

00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:28.460
but something to do with the contact would be useful.

00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:29.930
So I'm gonna take your contact.

00:04:29.930 --> 00:04:37.690
Schema equals toe schema factory don't create for class and then the name of the class that

00:04:37.690 --> 00:04:38.090
we have,

00:04:38.090 --> 00:04:40.410
which is nothing but the contact with this.

00:04:40.410 --> 00:04:44.970
Now our basic schema set up is ready in the next lecture.

00:04:44.970 --> 00:04:51.920
Let's create our post request handler where a user can submit a contact details that could

00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:53.350
be validated as well.

00:04:53.350 --> 00:04:55.140
As if validation is successful,

00:04:55.140 --> 00:04:56.520
we would be interested.

00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.470
Toe Add that to the Mongo db server.

00:04:58.470 --> 00:05:00.770
Using the Mang goes on that court,

00:05:00.770 --> 00:05:03.070
we will be writing in our service function.
