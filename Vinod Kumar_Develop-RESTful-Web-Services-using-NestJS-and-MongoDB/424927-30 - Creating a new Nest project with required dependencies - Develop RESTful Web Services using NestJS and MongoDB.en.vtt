00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.160
in this lecture.

00:00:01.160 --> 00:00:07.040
Let's create a new next year's project and add the required project Dependence is that

00:00:07.040 --> 00:00:12.560
include class validator class transformer on a library called Mangoes and unassociated

00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:15.550
library called at the rate next year slash bongos.

00:00:15.550 --> 00:00:20.390
I have opened a terminal and I'm already on my desktop and I'm going to give the command

00:00:20.390 --> 00:00:23.370
called nest new and then the project name.

00:00:23.370 --> 00:00:30.360
I'm gonna call it US nest dash mongo db dash demo press enter As usual,

00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:31.280
this is going toe.

00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:32.800
Create some source Cordes.

00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:34.050
And then it'll ask me,

00:00:34.050 --> 00:00:36.680
Do you want to use NPM Our yard?

00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:39.570
I'm gonna press enter because I want to use NPM.

00:00:39.570 --> 00:00:44.270
This is gonna take a couple of minutes and I will come back once the installation is done.

00:00:44.270 --> 00:00:51.010
So the installation is complete on the first Come and I have to execute is to city into the

00:00:51.010 --> 00:00:51.420
folder.

00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:51.740
Ramona.

00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:52.780
Type your city.

00:00:52.780 --> 00:00:56.820
Nestor Dash mongo db Dutch demo press entered.

00:00:56.820 --> 00:01:00.230
Let me clear the screen and then type the command NPM.

00:01:00.230 --> 00:01:05.930
I are in stone class dash validator class dash transformer,

00:01:05.930 --> 00:01:15.100
Mongoose Onda after it next year slash mangoes press enter class validator and class

00:01:15.100 --> 00:01:15.660
transformer.

00:01:15.660 --> 00:01:20.170
We want toe use so that when they're the post put our patch,

00:01:20.170 --> 00:01:25.090
we can validate the data sent by the user agonist or schema.

00:01:25.090 --> 00:01:28.480
These two have nothing to do with the Mongo DB itself.

00:01:28.480 --> 00:01:29.110
However,

00:01:29.110 --> 00:01:33.400
we want to build a complete arrest endpoint in this particular section,

00:01:33.400 --> 00:01:35.250
and that is the reason we're using that.

00:01:35.250 --> 00:01:36.390
In order to connect.

00:01:36.390 --> 00:01:37.200
Among would be,

00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:39.250
we need to use some library.

00:01:39.250 --> 00:01:41.730
There are many libraries available on mangoes.

00:01:41.730 --> 00:01:44.960
Happens to be the most popular among the rest of them.

00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:47.760
So now that the installation is ready,

00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.420
let's bring up the server by typing NPM run.

00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:53.250
Start calling Dell,

00:01:53.250 --> 00:01:57.930
which is going to start the development server occupying port number 3000.

00:01:57.930 --> 00:02:01.770
Also in another time,

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:06.310
I want to see in tow my desktop where my project is there,

00:02:06.310 --> 00:02:09.220
which is called Nest Dash Mongo DB.

00:02:09.220 --> 00:02:14.490
That's demo and then type court dot that brings up visuals to the Accord and loads the

00:02:14.490 --> 00:02:15.450
current project.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:17.360
So that's all for this lecture.

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:18.570
In the next lecture,

00:02:18.570 --> 00:02:25.420
let's create our contacts Model controller on service on Do the initial set of required for

00:02:25.420 --> 00:02:26.150
Mang goes
