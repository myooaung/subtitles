00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.890
in this letter let's create a logger middleware which is supposed to love the details off

00:00:05.890 --> 00:00:08.720
the incoming request onto our console here.

00:00:08.720 --> 00:00:15.050
So I kept my postman on the terminal side by side so we can check if the request is being

00:00:15.050 --> 00:00:16.320
loaned as off.

00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:16.480
No,

00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:22.790
you can t I have a request here for locals 3000 clicking on send I will get the response

00:00:22.790 --> 00:00:26.670
here Hello world But I don't see any response on the console.

00:00:26.670 --> 00:00:27.570
Similarly,

00:00:27.570 --> 00:00:33.120
if I go to the local host 3000 slash contacts click on send I am getting the details over

00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:35.110
here but there is no response.

00:00:35.110 --> 00:00:38.060
This is what we want to address using a middleweight.

00:00:38.060 --> 00:00:45.320
So let's go to our were scored here on in the SRC I'm gonna create a new file called lager

00:00:45.320 --> 00:00:51.650
middleware dot es inside which I will export a class called lager middleware To do so.

00:00:51.650 --> 00:00:58.820
I'm gonna click on this icon and type logger dot middleware dot t s first enter Onda.

00:00:58.820 --> 00:01:02.150
This is gonna be a regular JavaScript or typescript plants.

00:01:02.150 --> 00:01:07.170
I can simply say export class and then it a pure logger middle way.

00:01:07.170 --> 00:01:08.690
But importantly,

00:01:08.690 --> 00:01:11.310
you have to say implements nest,

00:01:11.310 --> 00:01:11.990
middle way.

00:01:11.990 --> 00:01:14.560
You can see that they didn't auto import option.

00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.340
So I'm going to click on that and it comes from next J slash Common.

00:01:18.340 --> 00:01:21.400
I have to open the curly bracket for the class definition.

00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:27.960
And still I see one error because implements interface means you must implement the methods

00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:33.630
in this you can actually go to the error and then press command out on macintosh are

00:01:33.630 --> 00:01:37.370
controlled out on windows and that's going to give you the quick fix on.

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.020
I can press,

00:01:38.020 --> 00:01:39.060
enter toe,

00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:41.450
implement that particular interface function.

00:01:41.450 --> 00:01:46.330
And what is the name of the function here is very important use which takes three

00:01:46.330 --> 00:01:49.460
perimeters request response on next,

00:01:49.460 --> 00:01:53.670
which is nothing but a function You can change the perimeters anyway.

00:01:53.670 --> 00:01:58.580
Here in the previous doctor mentioned that the nest middleware is nothing but the express

00:01:58.580 --> 00:01:59.460
Js middleware.

00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:05.070
So the arguments here off type of request and response and this is just a function so I can

00:02:05.070 --> 00:02:07.250
go in type your request here.

00:02:07.250 --> 00:02:09.750
I know that there are three different requests.

00:02:09.750 --> 00:02:11.550
The one that I want is I believe,

00:02:11.550 --> 00:02:12.630
the 3rd 1 here.

00:02:12.630 --> 00:02:14.160
I cannot see completely here,

00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:15.450
but I'm sure if I click on this.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:19.050
It's gonna show auto import from express interface.

00:02:19.050 --> 00:02:22.550
So that's what I want and you can see Regarded from Express.

00:02:22.550 --> 00:02:26.180
This one is also going to be from express module.

00:02:26.180 --> 00:02:28.570
The data type is called response.

00:02:28.570 --> 00:02:29.180
Once again,

00:02:29.180 --> 00:02:30.050
I have to select.

00:02:30.050 --> 00:02:33.060
I believe that 3rd 1 you can see that are to import from express.

00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:35.890
And the 3rd 1 is just a function.

00:02:35.890 --> 00:02:37.680
There is an interface called function.

00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.060
It's part off core,

00:02:39.060 --> 00:02:39.710
nor J.

00:02:39.710 --> 00:02:41.020
So you continue type here,

00:02:41.020 --> 00:02:45.250
function on that That's gonna be okay by declaring it off.

00:02:45.250 --> 00:02:48.640
Appropriate type via score can give you some interest,

00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:50.780
since that's the reason why we changed the data type.

00:02:50.780 --> 00:02:51.470
Otherwise it is.

00:02:51.470 --> 00:02:51.950
Okay,

00:02:51.950 --> 00:02:56.440
I'm gonna remove this throw statement on this is where we're actually going.

00:02:56.440 --> 00:03:03.840
Toe either check some details in the request or modify the response and finally called the

00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:05.040
next to function.

00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:05.830
Now,

00:03:05.830 --> 00:03:07.540
if you don't call the next function,

00:03:07.540 --> 00:03:11.330
then the client will get the response from the middle itself.

00:03:11.330 --> 00:03:15.030
The client request will never reach the actual target controller.

00:03:15.030 --> 00:03:20.470
Since we want to just a lot the details of the request we can simply type your console dot

00:03:20.470 --> 00:03:21.630
log on,

00:03:21.630 --> 00:03:24.230
then probably I want to print the method.

00:03:24.230 --> 00:03:26.340
That is the it's TDP method of the request.

00:03:26.340 --> 00:03:32.370
I can say arctic you dot You can see because I declared Arctic you off type requests we

00:03:32.370 --> 00:03:37.280
escort is ableto give me a list of all the possible attributes and I have to take your

00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:40.120
method that's going to give me Is it a get request?

00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:41.240
Posted questions to Trump.

00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:45.510
I also want to bring the actually oral being requested.

00:03:45.510 --> 00:03:47.910
So I'm gonna say are acute are you are?

00:03:47.910 --> 00:03:49.250
And likewise,

00:03:49.250 --> 00:03:51.030
you can give a couple of other parameters.

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:51.870
For example,

00:03:51.870 --> 00:03:52.780
request dark.

00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:57.800
I believe you can say quietly which is actually going to give you the list off quite

00:03:57.800 --> 00:03:58.730
distinct perimeters,

00:03:58.730 --> 00:04:00.190
if you have similarly,

00:04:00.190 --> 00:04:02.160
you can all just a request our body,

00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.150
in case of a put turn post methods.

00:04:04.150 --> 00:04:07.890
I just would like to give the method and you are nothing else.

00:04:07.890 --> 00:04:09.290
I'm gonna put a semicolon.

00:04:09.290 --> 00:04:12.930
I'm not gonna make any change to the response here.

00:04:12.930 --> 00:04:15.780
Although I received three parameters arrest warrants,

00:04:15.780 --> 00:04:20.290
I'm not going to make yourself that at all Now I think I don't want toe end the response

00:04:20.290 --> 00:04:20.880
over here.

00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.860
I'm gonna call the next available.

00:04:22.860 --> 00:04:27.770
Middle if there is no other middle very simply going to pass the control toe the actual

00:04:27.770 --> 00:04:28.290
target.

00:04:28.290 --> 00:04:29.650
The client wants to go toe.

00:04:29.650 --> 00:04:33.360
Now that we have our longer middle class ready,

00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:39.700
we can now register this with our at model are one of the feature model like the contacts

00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:40.100
model.

00:04:40.100 --> 00:04:41.580
In this example,

00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.630
I want to register my lager middleware with the APP model ts.

00:04:45.630 --> 00:04:51.180
So I have already opened the out model ts over here on the north that I did not write this

00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:52.520
as an injectable.

00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:53.820
It will still work.

00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:58.170
How we were in the documentation there mentioned that you mark this as injectable.

00:04:58.170 --> 00:05:00.460
Although you market at that injectable,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.850
you're not going to make an entry in the provider section like the services.

00:05:04.850 --> 00:05:09.800
But instead you're gonna come here and then override a conficker function.

00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:10.390
Ofcourse,

00:05:10.390 --> 00:05:13.900
the conficker function is because off an interface,

00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:17.310
I'm gonna write your implements nest model.

00:05:17.310 --> 00:05:21.090
Next module has a function called configure.

00:05:21.090 --> 00:05:22.570
That is why I'm getting another.

00:05:22.570 --> 00:05:23.080
Once again,

00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:28.360
I'm gonna click on the debtor message press commander because I'm on Mac press enter.

00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.510
You can see that we got a function here called Configure the perimeter off that is called

00:05:33.510 --> 00:05:36.040
consumer off type called middleware.

00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.980
Consumer noticed that it is going to be imported from next Js common,

00:05:39.980 --> 00:05:42.680
but we already have in SJs comin over here.

00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.090
We can simply add this to that list and to do so,

00:05:46.090 --> 00:05:53.270
I'm going to simply remove this onda press command dot and say add middleware consumer toe

00:05:53.270 --> 00:05:56.970
existing import declaration from Agnes j slash common.

00:05:56.970 --> 00:05:57.640
Also,

00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:01.760
we don't need this true statement because we're actually going toe implement the court over

00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:07.920
here on the only thing that we do inside this conficker at this point in time is we take

00:06:07.920 --> 00:06:11.070
this consumer and Cala function called Apply,

00:06:11.070 --> 00:06:13.630
which takes a middleware as a perimeter.

00:06:13.630 --> 00:06:18.730
Now that's how you register remedy were with next year's to do that.

00:06:18.730 --> 00:06:26.570
Let's type your consumer dot Apply on passing a list off middle wears separated by a comma

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:26.570
.

00:06:26.570 --> 00:06:27.970
It's basically a battered.

00:06:27.970 --> 00:06:28.740
You can see her.

00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:30.950
I can supply any number of middle bits.

00:06:30.950 --> 00:06:31.820
Where Emily,

00:06:31.820 --> 00:06:34.200
where can be a function are a data type.

00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:35.250
Nothing with a class.

00:06:35.250 --> 00:06:39.050
What we want to do now is toe supply our larder.

00:06:39.050 --> 00:06:39.590
Middleweight,

00:06:39.590 --> 00:06:42.210
all I have to do is to type in the name of the class,

00:06:42.210 --> 00:06:43.750
which is lager middle,

00:06:43.750 --> 00:06:50.740
and now our middleware is register with next year's game may also have to specify for which

00:06:50.740 --> 00:06:51.960
are out this longer.

00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:53.150
Middleware should work,

00:06:53.150 --> 00:06:55.680
so I'm gonna just type your dark far,

00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.570
wrote on then specify a list off road configurations on the road configuration here can be

00:07:02.570 --> 00:07:09.450
either a string or it could be a around conflict object which contains part and method,

00:07:09.450 --> 00:07:11.310
or it could be simply a controller.

00:07:11.310 --> 00:07:11.960
For example,

00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.300
I can tell you're contacts,

00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:17.850
controller and all the request to the context.

00:07:17.850 --> 00:07:20.540
Controllers will now be applied with this middle bit.

00:07:20.540 --> 00:07:25.170
Let's put a semicolon here since my file is automatically saved.

00:07:25.170 --> 00:07:26.290
Next,

00:07:26.290 --> 00:07:28.940
jets has automatically restarted the server.

00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:34.820
Let's make a request toe Locals 3000 which is not handled by context controller.

00:07:34.820 --> 00:07:36.490
So I deliver electric on this.

00:07:36.490 --> 00:07:38.820
I should not see any logs over here,

00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:42.450
So let's see that and you can see that we got the whole lower.

00:07:42.450 --> 00:07:44.420
But there is no all put here.

00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:45.130
However,

00:07:45.130 --> 00:07:50.210
if you go to the local owes 3000 slash contacts which they get require split consent,

00:07:50.210 --> 00:07:51.810
I got the output.

00:07:51.810 --> 00:07:56.730
I also got an output here on the console that says Get slash contacts.

00:07:56.730 --> 00:07:58.930
Let's check it out for the other one We're in,

00:07:58.930 --> 00:08:03.340
Say contacts likes to I got my response over here as well.

00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:08.700
I can see a response on the console log like where they forgo the patch.

00:08:08.700 --> 00:08:14.850
You can see that we're going to get the output over here on patch for which you are one.

00:08:14.850 --> 00:08:18.240
Last day they put And when I click on that,

00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:21.920
I should still see the log related to the request made.

00:08:21.920 --> 00:08:23.480
If you want,

00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:24.970
you can also go and say,

00:08:24.970 --> 00:08:26.040
What is the body?

00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:27.040
Let's give it a try.

00:08:27.040 --> 00:08:28.740
I go to my lager middleweight,

00:08:28.740 --> 00:08:34.340
and then specify here request dot body Go back over here.

00:08:34.340 --> 00:08:36.870
Let's send a put request on.

00:08:36.870 --> 00:08:41.390
You can see that this is the body which I'm sending in the form of JavaScript.

00:08:41.390 --> 00:08:41.950
Object.

00:08:41.950 --> 00:08:44.110
So you ready for Go to the patch,

00:08:44.110 --> 00:08:48.380
click on send the same thing we get here in the form off JavaScript object.

00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:51.050
We're sending a Jason string year.

00:08:51.050 --> 00:08:51.600
What?

00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:53.450
We got a jealous keep object.

00:08:53.450 --> 00:08:57.390
Suppose I want the logs to be printed only in case off.

00:08:57.390 --> 00:09:01.730
Put post and patch and not for other requests.

00:09:01.730 --> 00:09:09.030
What I can do is I can goto my at model ts on Instead of giving this contacts controller,

00:09:09.030 --> 00:09:16.420
let me commend this out on then give your dot for roads and then give a list off route in

00:09:16.420 --> 00:09:21.870
for object on If you see that far roads If a control click or command click on this,

00:09:21.870 --> 00:09:23.460
it's gonna take me to the definition.

00:09:23.460 --> 00:09:25.960
You can see that there is a road in for I can supply.

00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:29.990
Previously we supplied a data type like contacts controller.

00:09:29.990 --> 00:09:34.530
But this time I want to supply the route in for rooting for is nothing but an object that

00:09:34.530 --> 00:09:39.360
contains I thought the string and then a method off type called request method.

00:09:39.360 --> 00:09:41.490
So I like to specify what it apart.

00:09:41.490 --> 00:09:47.050
So let's go here now on then I'm going to give a couple off road in four objects.

00:09:47.050 --> 00:09:51.380
1st 1 that it is supposed to intercept all the contacts.

00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:59.450
You are requests only for matter and then I can say request method dart All delete.

00:09:59.450 --> 00:10:00.210
Get head.

00:10:00.210 --> 00:10:03.040
Choose one of the http request that you want to handle.

00:10:03.040 --> 00:10:06.930
Since I mentioned earlier that I want to handle post four turn patch,

00:10:06.930 --> 00:10:08.450
I have to give one by one.

00:10:08.450 --> 00:10:10.580
So this is one road configurations.

00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.930
I'm gonna put a comma and then press our shift.

00:10:13.930 --> 00:10:17.270
Don't at all on Macintosh option Shift down arrow.

00:10:17.270 --> 00:10:19.500
You can see it's get duplicated again.

00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:21.950
I'm gonna do the same thing on one of them.

00:10:21.950 --> 00:10:23.970
I'm gonna change this to say Post.

00:10:23.970 --> 00:10:26.250
One of them is going to be put on.

00:10:26.250 --> 00:10:27.650
One of them is going to be patched.

00:10:27.650 --> 00:10:31.790
Let's go to the postman and then see if it's going toe.

00:10:31.790 --> 00:10:36.640
Give me any old put for put so off course put should be intercepted over here.

00:10:36.640 --> 00:10:38.910
And I should see a log related to that.

00:10:38.910 --> 00:10:42.330
And I don't see here because it's not for slash contacts,

00:10:42.330 --> 00:10:44.580
but it is Far slash contact slash star.

00:10:44.580 --> 00:10:47.850
So I'm gonna go give here for put method.

00:10:47.850 --> 00:10:50.950
It's gonna be context Last star for Patch.

00:10:50.950 --> 00:10:52.780
It is gonna be context Last star.

00:10:52.780 --> 00:10:55.200
But for posters just going to be contacts.

00:10:55.200 --> 00:10:58.520
Let's go back to Postman on check What happens?

00:10:58.520 --> 00:10:59.570
Know that the next day,

00:10:59.570 --> 00:11:00.740
sir worries we started,

00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:02.950
so I'm gonna click on send Andi.

00:11:02.950 --> 00:11:05.550
You can see that we gotta put slash contacts.

00:11:05.550 --> 00:11:06.250
Last two,

00:11:06.250 --> 00:11:07.420
we got the paler.

00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:09.380
I'm gonna go to the patch.

00:11:09.380 --> 00:11:10.490
Send it across.

00:11:10.490 --> 00:11:11.170
You can see that.

00:11:11.170 --> 00:11:11.920
I got that.

00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:13.150
I don't have a post request,

00:11:13.150 --> 00:11:14.440
but I'm sure you're gonna get that.

00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:20.450
But if I'm going to send the request toe contacts slash to We got the output here,

00:11:20.450 --> 00:11:22.150
but we don't have any logs.

00:11:22.150 --> 00:11:27.690
That's how you can filter certain requests toe be intercepted by our middleweight.

00:11:27.690 --> 00:11:33.860
You can also read the documentation for various other regular expressions that you can use

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:33.860
.

00:11:33.860 --> 00:11:40.000
But this is how you can create a class based middleware on register with your APP model.

00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.670
In the next lecture,

00:11:41.670 --> 00:11:44.290
let's see how we can create our cars.

00:11:44.290 --> 00:11:47.320
Middleware cars stand for cross origin.

00:11:47.320 --> 00:11:49.430
So sharing that means if you're resting,

00:11:49.430 --> 00:11:53.530
point is being accessed by some other third party JavaScript climbs.

00:11:53.530 --> 00:11:58.180
Unless you specify that it is OK for other people to access by the four.

00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:00.290
Http protocol doesn't permit this.

00:12:00.290 --> 00:12:03.230
So in order to enable that we want to add additional headers,

00:12:03.230 --> 00:12:05.770
let's not worry about the cars itself,

00:12:05.770 --> 00:12:09.260
but we will see how toe enable cars in case if it's required
