00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.310
here is a small assignment for you.

00:00:02.310 --> 00:00:03.720
It has three tasks.

00:00:03.720 --> 00:00:09.020
Number one task is toe Implement a handler for put request,

00:00:09.020 --> 00:00:15.110
which is supposed to take an entire payload representing all the details of the contact for

00:00:15.110 --> 00:00:16.070
a given 80.

00:00:16.070 --> 00:00:19.450
And then when I submit the current of details off,

00:00:19.450 --> 00:00:24.450
this particular person in the database should be replaced with whatever that I'm sampling

00:00:24.450 --> 00:00:25.210
as a payload.

00:00:25.210 --> 00:00:28.960
The second task is the patch implementation,

00:00:28.960 --> 00:00:34.620
where I can supply partial data Name our email for a given idee.

00:00:34.620 --> 00:00:36.520
It should read in the rest of the details,

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:42.010
but only the one that I'm supplying should be overridden on 1/3 test is toe.

00:00:42.010 --> 00:00:44.670
Send in a delete request for a given.

00:00:44.670 --> 00:00:45.000
Heidi.

00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.760
There is no payload or body associated with a dilute request.

00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:54.930
A payload can be sent only where post foot or patch get and delete Do not have any payload

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:54.930
.

00:00:54.930 --> 00:00:56.330
So when we send this deal,

00:00:56.330 --> 00:01:01.370
it request the data corresponding to this particular user must be deleted from our five.

00:01:01.370 --> 00:01:03.830
Also in all the three cases.

00:01:03.830 --> 00:01:06.080
If the idea supplied is invalid,

00:01:06.080 --> 00:01:09.240
we should get for not for adult status.

00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.150
You should be able to finish these tasks in the next 15 to 20 minutes.

00:01:13.150 --> 00:01:14.630
Once you finish that,

00:01:14.630 --> 00:01:18.530
please go through the next lecture where I'm providing a solution for the same.
