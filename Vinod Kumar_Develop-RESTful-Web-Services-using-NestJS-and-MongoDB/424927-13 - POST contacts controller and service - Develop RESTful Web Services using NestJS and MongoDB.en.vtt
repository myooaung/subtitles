00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.370
in this lecture.

00:00:01.370 --> 00:00:04.220
Let's write a handler for http.

00:00:04.220 --> 00:00:08.120
Post requests for adding one or more contacts,

00:00:08.120 --> 00:00:10.490
and that's gonna be dysfunctional controller.

00:00:10.490 --> 00:00:12.000
But before that,

00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:12.650
let's right.

00:00:12.650 --> 00:00:14.910
The survey scored for the same things.

00:00:14.910 --> 00:00:17.090
I'm going to switch to my contacts with tears.

00:00:17.090 --> 00:00:18.600
I'm gonna right here.

00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:19.600
Two functions,

00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.300
one function that can handle adding off a single content.

00:00:23.300 --> 00:00:25.300
On another function toe.

00:00:25.300 --> 00:00:29.050
Add an array of context to our contacts database.

00:00:29.050 --> 00:00:33.440
I'm going to write a function called Add one contract,

00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.150
which receives basically a single contact object.

00:00:37.150 --> 00:00:39.650
And here is where I have toe.

00:00:39.650 --> 00:00:40.670
Take that object,

00:00:40.670 --> 00:00:42.460
add a newly generated I D.

00:00:42.460 --> 00:00:46.920
Which I can make yourself from here and then push the same thing to our Ari,

00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:49.310
which is in memory data structure on.

00:00:49.310 --> 00:00:53.910
Then take that our A and right to the actual file for which I have written a function

00:00:53.910 --> 00:00:55.120
called Right to Fight.

00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:56.600
Once that is done,

00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:01.220
we simply have toe written this contract object with the auto generated idea.

00:01:01.220 --> 00:01:03.270
So let's assign the i d.

00:01:03.270 --> 00:01:09.600
First someone type your contact dot I dy equals toe this start and I can say next I d just

00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.080
like this notice.

00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:13.140
Next idea that function,

00:01:13.140 --> 00:01:15.830
but because it is a get function,

00:01:15.830 --> 00:01:19.330
I'm using this as if it's a read only variable,

00:01:19.330 --> 00:01:22.620
which is nothing but the return value off that function.

00:01:22.620 --> 00:01:24.630
I know that I have the i d.

00:01:24.630 --> 00:01:26.970
I can simply say this start contact,

00:01:26.970 --> 00:01:27.410
start,

00:01:27.410 --> 00:01:30.410
push and then I'm going to supply the contact.

00:01:30.410 --> 00:01:33.220
And now that the member variable contacts,

00:01:33.220 --> 00:01:34.030
which is an array,

00:01:34.030 --> 00:01:35.220
is modified,

00:01:35.220 --> 00:01:41.220
we have toe update this back to the file for which I can simply say this dot right to file

00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.690
function in case of dysfunction throws an exception.

00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:46.640
I'm not handling that over here.

00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.200
Whoever is calling this will have to handle that.

00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:50.850
And that's nothing but my controller.

00:01:50.850 --> 00:01:54.070
And if your controller doesn't handle this exception,

00:01:54.070 --> 00:01:58.430
then automatically nest will take care of that because there is a default error handling

00:01:58.430 --> 00:01:59.050
mechanism.

00:01:59.050 --> 00:01:59.890
However,

00:01:59.890 --> 00:02:04.500
we can also have our own exception handling mechanism which will see in the subsequent

00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:05.200
lectures.

00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.040
But for now,

00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:12.420
the last statement that I have to do here is to return the contact which now contains the

00:02:12.420 --> 00:02:13.440
newly generated I.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:13.660
D.

00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:15.400
Also likewise,

00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:20.720
I'm gonna write one more function called add many contacts on Dhere.

00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:24.750
I'm gonna type contacts which is supposed to be an every object,

00:02:24.750 --> 00:02:26.610
unlike the previous one.

00:02:26.610 --> 00:02:28.370
I have to know Newport,

00:02:28.370 --> 00:02:32.030
this Ari and then for each of the element in that area.

00:02:32.030 --> 00:02:34.180
How toe a Zander next idee.

00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.270
First,

00:02:35.270 --> 00:02:40.540
let's get the next idee by typing Let next I d equals toe distort.

00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:40.970
Next,

00:02:40.970 --> 00:02:46.590
I d notice that this is not a matter call to the function that we have written over here on

00:02:46.590 --> 00:02:47.680
whatever the return value is,

00:02:47.680 --> 00:02:48.490
there is a sign.

00:02:48.490 --> 00:02:49.210
For example,

00:02:49.210 --> 00:02:52.110
let's assume I already have 10 contact,

00:02:52.110 --> 00:02:53.570
so this would be 11.

00:02:53.570 --> 00:02:59.600
And now I have to go Increments is 11 and then assigned toe each one of these elements in

00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:00.620
the context array,

00:03:00.620 --> 00:03:04.900
and that can be done by typing contacts dot for each,

00:03:04.900 --> 00:03:07.230
which is going to take a call back on.

00:03:07.230 --> 00:03:10.550
The callback receives two parameters here.

00:03:10.550 --> 00:03:13.180
The 1st 1 is the unusual contact,

00:03:13.180 --> 00:03:13.750
and second,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:15.650
is the index off the contact.

00:03:15.650 --> 00:03:17.370
On using that,

00:03:17.370 --> 00:03:19.250
I can no manipulate that variable.

00:03:19.250 --> 00:03:27.590
See such a cedar i d equals toe the index plus next highly so the first index would be zero

00:03:27.590 --> 00:03:28.240
on that.

00:03:28.240 --> 00:03:30.220
Zero will be added to the next tidy,

00:03:30.220 --> 00:03:30.870
for example,

00:03:30.870 --> 00:03:31.390
11.

00:03:31.390 --> 00:03:35.500
So the idea for this particular object would be 11.

00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.110
But as the loop progresses,

00:03:37.110 --> 00:03:38.330
it's going to be 12.

00:03:38.330 --> 00:03:40.720
And then it's gonna be 13 and so on and so forth.

00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.570
I made a typo here that's supposed to be a semi colon.

00:03:43.570 --> 00:03:48.100
Now that all the elements off this contacts are have ideas.

00:03:48.100 --> 00:03:51.030
I just had to push this to the member variable,

00:03:51.030 --> 00:03:53.130
so I'll see her distort contact.

00:03:53.130 --> 00:03:54.050
Start pushed.

00:03:54.050 --> 00:04:00.150
You can't simply take contacts here because then imagine this Door contacts has 10 unusual

00:04:00.150 --> 00:04:03.210
contacts that entirely becomes the 11th element.

00:04:03.210 --> 00:04:04.280
So we don't want that.

00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.240
We want to spread this arrest,

00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:11.750
so we simply have to type your triple dot So the members off this will be no added one by

00:04:11.750 --> 00:04:16.700
one to this particular contacts attic now that the contacts has been manipulated.

00:04:16.700 --> 00:04:18.290
So we need toe persist.

00:04:18.290 --> 00:04:25.190
This back to the file on the way I can do is this start right to file on return the enter

00:04:25.190 --> 00:04:26.330
our contacts,

00:04:26.330 --> 00:04:28.750
each of which have now a new I.

00:04:28.750 --> 00:04:29.110
D.

00:04:29.110 --> 00:04:34.240
So this is the business logic involved in adding the contacts and notice that we again

00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:40.740
followed a single responsibility principle where a function has a single responsibility not

00:04:40.740 --> 00:04:41.750
to responsibilities.

00:04:41.750 --> 00:04:44.850
So we have divided the task two separate functions,

00:04:44.850 --> 00:04:46.150
which is a good practice.

00:04:46.150 --> 00:04:50.370
Now let's go back door controller where I can make it off this surveys,

00:04:50.370 --> 00:04:53.010
and the first thing that we will do is tow.

00:04:53.010 --> 00:05:00.330
Add a decorator here at the right post auto import from next year's common No perimeters

00:05:00.330 --> 00:05:01.190
required for that.

00:05:01.190 --> 00:05:01.960
However,

00:05:01.960 --> 00:05:05.850
we want to read the entire body that's coming from the request.

00:05:05.850 --> 00:05:06.920
To do that,

00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:09.980
we're to declare a variable something called Body.

00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.590
The variable in can be anything,

00:05:11.590 --> 00:05:15.410
but it has to be decorated with that body like this.

00:05:15.410 --> 00:05:20.910
The body may contain one single contact object or an array of contact objects.

00:05:20.910 --> 00:05:27.340
All I have to do is to check if body is an instance off Ari.

00:05:27.340 --> 00:05:29.720
Then I'm going to say return.

00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:31.600
This starts are we start.

00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.240
Remember,

00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:34.600
we have a function called are many contacts,

00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.980
and that's where I'm gonna supply the entire body.

00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:43.980
This is not going toe loop over each of those elements as the ideas adds the polar database

00:05:43.980 --> 00:05:50.630
in the memory and then persisted into a fight and then returns that enter Ari on data is

00:05:50.630 --> 00:05:52.700
going to be returned back to the user.

00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.270
But in case if it's not in a way,

00:05:55.270 --> 00:05:58.020
I assume that it's one single contact object.

00:05:58.020 --> 00:05:58.640
I'm gonna say,

00:05:58.640 --> 00:06:05.850
Return this start service dot Are one contact and then I supply the same body over here.

00:06:05.850 --> 00:06:11.500
Now you can see that the responsibility off this particular controller function is very

00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.070
simple.

00:06:12.070 --> 00:06:19.170
It just taking the http content and then passing it toe more sophisticated service function

00:06:19.170 --> 00:06:21.390
for complex functionality.

00:06:21.390 --> 00:06:22.410
Human.

00:06:22.410 --> 00:06:27.520
It is one thing here that we're taking the entire body and assuming that it could be an

00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:30.180
area or it could be a one contact object.

00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.690
But it is possible that the user,

00:06:32.690 --> 00:06:33.600
while posting,

00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.530
might have supplied instead of a contact information,

00:06:36.530 --> 00:06:39.070
probably a book information out of product information.

00:06:39.070 --> 00:06:40.760
At this point in time,

00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:43.090
we're not gonna take care of those validations.

00:06:43.090 --> 00:06:43.930
However,

00:06:43.930 --> 00:06:48.490
we are going to take care of the validations using something called pipes which will

00:06:48.490 --> 00:06:53.020
validate the incoming request body against our schema.

00:06:53.020 --> 00:06:58.200
So that means that if I define a contact class and that said that though there is the first

00:06:58.200 --> 00:06:58.400
name,

00:06:58.400 --> 00:07:02.800
that is the last name does an email phone etcetera and the body doesn't conform to that,

00:07:02.800 --> 00:07:04.630
then it's gonna throw an exception.

00:07:04.630 --> 00:07:05.750
But at this point in time,

00:07:05.750 --> 00:07:07.650
let's go blindfolded,

00:07:07.650 --> 00:07:07.780
Lee,

00:07:07.780 --> 00:07:12.710
and assume that either it's a one single contact object or it's gonna be an array of

00:07:12.710 --> 00:07:13.650
contact objects.

00:07:13.650 --> 00:07:18.580
Now that we have written the controller on the corresponding service,

00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:21.320
it's time for us to check the functionality off the same.

00:07:21.320 --> 00:07:23.480
Let's go to our postman on.

00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:25.850
Then make a new post request.

00:07:25.850 --> 00:07:29.390
Over here on the euro is gonna be http.

00:07:29.390 --> 00:07:36.300
Colon double slash local host Colin 6000 is because in the main 30 years,

00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:38.030
the port number is 3000.

00:07:38.030 --> 00:07:40.040
If it all you want to ever change this,

00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.710
come here and then change.

00:07:41.710 --> 00:07:45.400
Restart the server are somewhere anywhere gets restarted automatically.

00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:48.150
The port will be changed automatically as well.

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:53.420
So if I go back over here locals 3000 slash contacts.

00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:58.420
This is nothing but the controller that I've returned here on the note that the controller

00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:00.040
has been mapped toe contact.

00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.120
But since I'm doing a post request the entire post request,

00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:05.550
it's positive the dysfunction,

00:08:05.550 --> 00:08:08.320
whatever the body is there will be supplied to here.

00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:12.740
So I go back over here to send one contact object.

00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.980
I'm gonna select Body Rock.

00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:21.260
And then I select the Jason which acts and its TDP request header called Content type.

00:08:21.260 --> 00:08:23.580
With only off applications like Jason,

00:08:23.580 --> 00:08:27.150
I'm gonna use a curly bracket because I'm supposed to send one object,

00:08:27.150 --> 00:08:34.640
and I'm gonna simply give your name is not on the email is let's say we know at the rate we

00:08:34.640 --> 00:08:37.860
know dot co If I send it now,

00:08:37.860 --> 00:08:42.580
this being a single object here it goes to the Elsa section on.

00:08:42.580 --> 00:08:44.490
Then add one contact on.

00:08:44.490 --> 00:08:44.840
Remember,

00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.730
at this point in time,

00:08:45.730 --> 00:08:46.960
I don't have the file.

00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:50.940
So the final is supposed to be newly created on.

00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:52.750
We're gonna see that file over here,

00:08:52.750 --> 00:08:57.750
and the file is going to contain the data that I'm gonna supply along with the idea one.

00:08:57.750 --> 00:08:59.120
So let's click on,

00:08:59.120 --> 00:09:03.110
send on and see what happens and you can see No,

00:09:03.110 --> 00:09:06.400
we got the same details along with the idea One.

00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.360
However,

00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.000
if I'm gonna make another request,

00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:12.650
let's copy this at a new tab.

00:09:12.650 --> 00:09:13.570
Once again,

00:09:13.570 --> 00:09:15.300
it's going to be a post request.

00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:15.840
Same.

00:09:15.840 --> 00:09:23.140
You gotta go to the body fiction raw and then choose Jason This time I'm gonna send in a

00:09:23.140 --> 00:09:24.560
day off to values here,

00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:25.330
for example.

00:09:25.330 --> 00:09:30.810
I'll say one object with name off Laetitia on,

00:09:30.810 --> 00:09:39.660
then email off levitation at example dot com on another object over here on this is gonna

00:09:39.660 --> 00:09:40.880
contain name as that,

00:09:40.880 --> 00:09:46.760
said John on the email as John at example dot com.

00:09:46.760 --> 00:09:53.820
So I'm sending another because of which this is a function that's going to be executed on

00:09:53.820 --> 00:09:54.820
that function.

00:09:54.820 --> 00:10:00.310
Are many contacts is going toe loop over each of the elements gender.

00:10:00.310 --> 00:10:02.670
It's annuity for them and push us that.

00:10:02.670 --> 00:10:08.700
And remember at this time I already have one element in our context or Jason on.

00:10:08.700 --> 00:10:09.720
If you check over here,

00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.990
there is a file called Context or Jason.

00:10:11.990 --> 00:10:14.850
This was created because of my previous request.

00:10:14.850 --> 00:10:17.750
I click on this and you can see there is one value here.

00:10:17.750 --> 00:10:19.980
If I submit this now,

00:10:19.980 --> 00:10:22.540
I should get the same array with new ideas.

00:10:22.540 --> 00:10:26.320
Two and three on the same thing is also objected to the file.

00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:27.580
Let me form at this.

00:10:27.580 --> 00:10:34.800
You can press all shift F on Windows machines and option shift F on Mac to former the cord

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:34.800
,

00:10:34.800 --> 00:10:38.150
and you can see now I have here formatted content,

00:10:38.150 --> 00:10:41.090
which contains I did want to three also.

00:10:41.090 --> 00:10:42.710
So with this now,

00:10:42.710 --> 00:10:49.030
our post request handler is done along with the service functionalities corresponding to

00:10:49.030 --> 00:10:50.930
the same in the next lecture.

00:10:50.930 --> 00:10:55.850
Let's right the controller and the service functionality for getting the list off all the

00:10:55.850 --> 00:10:57.630
contracts from our five.
