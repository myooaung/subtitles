00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.420
let's implement the delete feature in the bottom up approach.

00:00:04.420 --> 00:00:07.000
So I'm gonna create a service function first.

00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:14.570
Unlike the previous examples that they delete contact and then take idea the perimeter off

00:00:14.570 --> 00:00:17.240
string type and inside the function,

00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:22.170
I'm gonna say Return this start contact model dot Delete one.

00:00:22.170 --> 00:00:24.830
We have to supply quality.

00:00:24.830 --> 00:00:28.430
That filters one record based on the idea.

00:00:28.430 --> 00:00:29.150
So I'm gonna say,

00:00:29.150 --> 00:00:29.800
Curly bracket,

00:00:29.800 --> 00:00:31.090
which the Jason object,

00:00:31.090 --> 00:00:31.980
I'll say underscore.

00:00:31.980 --> 00:00:33.450
Ready colon idee.

00:00:33.450 --> 00:00:40.130
Let's put a semi colon And now my surgeries function for the leading A document is really

00:00:40.130 --> 00:00:43.350
the function returns a promise object.

00:00:43.350 --> 00:00:47.120
The promise object is supposed to be received in the controller.

00:00:47.120 --> 00:00:51.770
And then either we can return the promise directly toe nest,

00:00:51.770 --> 00:00:57.660
which eventually will result that are we can resolve it by using the casing await keyword

00:00:57.660 --> 00:01:00.050
just like the way we did it in a couple of examples,

00:01:00.050 --> 00:01:02.600
and in case if there is any exception,

00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:03.870
we can throw the same thing.

00:01:03.870 --> 00:01:04.940
So first,

00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:08.680
let's write the ad rate delete and in the bracket,

00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:12.180
we're gonna receive a part perimeter colon I D.

00:01:12.180 --> 00:01:13.800
As in the previous case,

00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:16.050
if this operation is successful,

00:01:16.050 --> 00:01:22.570
let us simply respond the user with 204 which indicates everything is okay as the less

00:01:22.570 --> 00:01:24.550
there has been an update on the backend.

00:01:24.550 --> 00:01:26.190
So I'll say here at the rate,

00:01:26.190 --> 00:01:27.030
http,

00:01:27.030 --> 00:01:32.200
Cool and then directly I can say 204 r As a good practice,

00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.400
you can say it's GDP staters dot no content and the function.

00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:42.050
We will start with a think because we want to write a weight cable inside the function.

00:01:42.050 --> 00:01:47.350
Let's write the name of the function as delete contact and then the perimeter.

00:01:47.350 --> 00:01:51.430
Whatever that we have got over here that has to be assigned to a variable cell,

00:01:51.430 --> 00:01:55.750
say moderate bottom off idee should be assigned to a variable.

00:01:55.750 --> 00:01:57.940
The variable name itself can be anything.

00:01:57.940 --> 00:02:03.830
I prefer to give idea itself on off the type string and inside the function,

00:02:03.830 --> 00:02:08.710
we're going to say Let the return value from the service function.

00:02:08.710 --> 00:02:11.910
We want to say a weight because we don't want a promise.

00:02:11.910 --> 00:02:13.400
We want the promise to be resolved.

00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:19.870
I said this start service dot delete contact and we supply the idea we received.

00:02:19.870 --> 00:02:25.290
This is supposed to give me a promise object which is going to be resolved And if the

00:02:25.290 --> 00:02:27.070
promises results successfully,

00:02:27.070 --> 00:02:29.270
the result While it will be assigned to this,

00:02:29.270 --> 00:02:32.740
this is not actually the Mongo DB document,

00:02:32.740 --> 00:02:34.240
which represents our contact,

00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.150
but instead it represents some kind of a status object.

00:02:37.150 --> 00:02:40.850
This will have a property called dilated count.

00:02:40.850 --> 00:02:45.650
So if I have deleted multiple documents than the deleted account will indicate how many

00:02:45.650 --> 00:02:48.310
documents have been deleted in the baby aisle,

00:02:48.310 --> 00:02:49.400
said the Delete one.

00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.970
So it is going to come as one,

00:02:50.970 --> 00:02:53.420
but in gratified supply that wrong i d.

00:02:53.420 --> 00:02:55.280
There will not be any exception,

00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:57.050
but the dilated can will be zero.

00:02:57.050 --> 00:03:03.950
We will capture that information on then check if red dot deleted account.

00:03:03.950 --> 00:03:06.560
This is the building property that Mom,

00:03:06.560 --> 00:03:10.000
who's gives us on mangoes gets that information from the manga levy.

00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.710
If this is equals to zero,

00:03:12.710 --> 00:03:15.790
that means the idea that you supply is wrong.

00:03:15.790 --> 00:03:17.350
It was not phoned,

00:03:17.350 --> 00:03:19.400
so we will throw an equal,

00:03:19.400 --> 00:03:22.600
an exception called not phone exception.

00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:26.800
And now our comptroller under service function.

00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:27.890
Both of them are ready.

00:03:27.890 --> 00:03:32.850
Let's go toe postman sending a deal it request for an existing document.

00:03:32.850 --> 00:03:38.470
First in I should get 204 if I send the request once again.

00:03:38.470 --> 00:03:40.050
Then it should give me a four,

00:03:40.050 --> 00:03:40.600
not fall.

00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.650
So let's go to the postman.

00:03:42.650 --> 00:03:45.560
Send in a village request for this itself.

00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:46.110
Currently,

00:03:46.110 --> 00:03:49.210
if I click on the send button using the get request You see,

00:03:49.210 --> 00:03:50.450
I'm able to get the data.

00:03:50.450 --> 00:03:53.250
I'm gonna sell it this deleted from here.

00:03:53.250 --> 00:03:54.650
Send it.

00:03:54.650 --> 00:03:56.720
You can see we got to not four,

00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:57.950
which says no content.

00:03:57.950 --> 00:04:00.950
That means the record has been successfully deleted.

00:04:00.950 --> 00:04:04.090
So if I go and ask for days,

00:04:04.090 --> 00:04:09.060
you should see that I should get a fortnight for as well as if I send the deal it request

00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:12.260
once again because the document doesn't exist with this,

00:04:12.260 --> 00:04:17.150
I d the should again come back with a fortnight for and we got it.

00:04:17.150 --> 00:04:22.450
So this is how you handled the delete request in a nest application?
