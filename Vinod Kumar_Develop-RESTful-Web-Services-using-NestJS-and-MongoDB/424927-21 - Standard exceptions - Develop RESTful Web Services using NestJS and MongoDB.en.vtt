00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.140
next comes with the built in exception layer,

00:00:03.140 --> 00:00:08.150
which is responsible for processing all unhand exceptions across your application.

00:00:08.150 --> 00:00:11.440
When an exception is not handled by your application called,

00:00:11.440 --> 00:00:13.770
then it's going to be caught by this layer,

00:00:13.770 --> 00:00:19.700
which then automatically sends an appropriate user friendly response in Jason Format.

00:00:19.700 --> 00:00:21.230
To understand the same.

00:00:21.230 --> 00:00:22.540
Let's take an example.

00:00:22.540 --> 00:00:25.840
I have created a brand new SJS project.

00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.930
It's called Nest Exceptions Demo.

00:00:27.930 --> 00:00:31.050
I haven't made any changes to this particular application,

00:00:31.050 --> 00:00:36.030
So when I make a request toe local host 3000 I'm simply going to get Hello World.

00:00:36.030 --> 00:00:37.050
Let's check it out.

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:43.130
But let's assume that this is a secure resource and in order to access the same,

00:00:43.130 --> 00:00:47.580
why are the header I have to send here something called authorization talking.

00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:49.610
So in my controller here,

00:00:49.610 --> 00:00:54.140
I want to check if the request comes with a header called authorization.

00:00:54.140 --> 00:00:55.780
If it is missing,

00:00:55.780 --> 00:00:57.130
I want to throw an exception.

00:00:57.130 --> 00:01:00.360
But if the authorization had is present,

00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:03.860
usually it will be in the form off encrypted text.

00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:05.260
We want toe Take that.

00:01:05.260 --> 00:01:10.200
We want to decrypt the check if the user is a valid user and then we want all of the either

00:01:10.200 --> 00:01:11.550
to access our resource.

00:01:11.550 --> 00:01:12.820
In this example.

00:01:12.820 --> 00:01:16.660
We're only going to check if the header contains the authorization token.

00:01:16.660 --> 00:01:18.220
If it is not present,

00:01:18.220 --> 00:01:19.550
we want to throw an exception.

00:01:19.550 --> 00:01:22.200
So the first thing we have to do is tow access.

00:01:22.200 --> 00:01:27.250
The http requested a on to get the request object itself.

00:01:27.250 --> 00:01:29.650
You can ask for the dependency injection here,

00:01:29.650 --> 00:01:33.000
So the way you can do is at the rate R E Q,

00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:38.620
which comes from this chase common and then assigned to a variable called Arctic.

00:01:38.620 --> 00:01:40.370
You are request or whatever you want.

00:01:40.370 --> 00:01:41.370
Similarly,

00:01:41.370 --> 00:01:43.200
if you want a response object,

00:01:43.200 --> 00:01:49.350
you can declare a variable here and then a noted the same using moderate arias decorator.

00:01:49.350 --> 00:01:55.180
So let's come down here and then get the actual header value that soliders let out equals

00:01:55.180 --> 00:01:56.920
toe request.

00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:03.930
Our header on the head of that I'm looking for is authorization if this is not present so I

00:02:03.930 --> 00:02:04.530
can check here.

00:02:04.530 --> 00:02:05.710
If not ought,

00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.850
then I simply want toe throw an exception.

00:02:08.850 --> 00:02:11.130
You can throw any exception you want.

00:02:11.130 --> 00:02:11.720
For example,

00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.130
I can simply say throw new editor and then supply another message.

00:02:16.130 --> 00:02:17.360
Like for example,

00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.650
authorization header is missing in the request.

00:02:21.650 --> 00:02:27.160
But if the authorization token is there were simply going toe give the actual response.

00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:27.460
Ideally,

00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:29.650
we should check with other authorization.

00:02:29.650 --> 00:02:30.780
Token is valued,

00:02:30.780 --> 00:02:33.800
but that we will do in a different section right now.

00:02:33.800 --> 00:02:39.230
We want to see how the exceptions are 100 see them throwing it and not handling in our

00:02:39.230 --> 00:02:39.940
application.

00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:44.210
This is gonna be handled by the default exception layer I was talking with earlier.

00:02:44.210 --> 00:02:45.520
So let's go and check it out.

00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:51.990
So when I make a request to know your consent and you can see we got a Jason or put,

00:02:51.990 --> 00:02:55.440
we got the state escort as 500 internal server error.

00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:57.840
The state of school has given us 500.

00:02:57.840 --> 00:02:59.990
Message is Internet server error.

00:02:59.990 --> 00:03:02.540
But as you can see that I have given a message here,

00:03:02.540 --> 00:03:07.190
that is Authorization Header is missing in the request that did not come.

00:03:07.190 --> 00:03:12.050
So instead of throwing some arbitrary exception or error object,

00:03:12.050 --> 00:03:15.430
So let's convert this new editor in tow.

00:03:15.430 --> 00:03:17.360
New http exception.

00:03:17.360 --> 00:03:21.750
So the its GDP exception is again coming from nest Jay's common,

00:03:21.750 --> 00:03:23.410
but that takes two parameters,

00:03:23.410 --> 00:03:24.100
not one.

00:03:24.100 --> 00:03:25.380
There is a message,

00:03:25.380 --> 00:03:28.520
and then you also have to give the it's TTP state of school,

00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:35.360
which can be either a number are there is an http status plants which provides an alias for

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.860
each of those intercourse.

00:03:36.860 --> 00:03:42.430
So I can simply say that this is gonna be a 403 because the user has not supplied the

00:03:42.430 --> 00:03:45.140
authorization other and it's supposed to be forbidden.

00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:46.820
So let's go and check now.

00:03:46.820 --> 00:03:48.400
What happens so earlier?

00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:50.590
I did not get my custom message,

00:03:50.590 --> 00:03:53.550
but now I'm supposed to get the actual custom message.

00:03:53.550 --> 00:03:56.160
You can see that we got the messages.

00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:58.250
Authorization headed is missing in the request.

00:03:58.250 --> 00:04:01.780
We were If I go to the header section in the request,

00:04:01.780 --> 00:04:05.200
send authorization as the name.

00:04:05.200 --> 00:04:06.740
Any value doesn't matter.

00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:11.520
I'm just going to type some gibberish value here and then click on send this time because

00:04:11.520 --> 00:04:13.070
there is a header present.

00:04:13.070 --> 00:04:16.010
I'm getting the actual all put on not an exception.

00:04:16.010 --> 00:04:20.020
But its GDP exception is taking two parameters here,

00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.710
the 1st 1 being the message.

00:04:21.710 --> 00:04:23.040
We have given a string,

00:04:23.040 --> 00:04:26.360
but if you carefully observed the actual signature,

00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:32.450
the response is nothing with a string are called record is nothing but an object.

00:04:32.450 --> 00:04:34.970
It can be a bunch off name value pills,

00:04:34.970 --> 00:04:35.740
for example.

00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.790
I want to give more detailed information about this so I can remove this from here.

00:04:40.790 --> 00:04:45.910
Let's say I'm gonna declare a variable called Yara and send the same here on Let's create

00:04:45.910 --> 00:04:46.540
the variable.

00:04:46.540 --> 00:04:49.750
Let's let Err equals to an empty object.

00:04:49.750 --> 00:04:51.690
And inside that empty object I'm gonna give,

00:04:51.690 --> 00:04:52.030
say,

00:04:52.030 --> 00:04:53.000
for example,

00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.250
court is 40 t This is the same thing as what we're sending.

00:04:57.250 --> 00:04:57.780
But of course,

00:04:57.780 --> 00:04:59.260
you can give a different name.

00:04:59.260 --> 00:05:00.460
Value pairs over here,

00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:01.470
for example.

00:05:01.470 --> 00:05:04.040
The default text was given us a message.

00:05:04.040 --> 00:05:04.480
Instead,

00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:07.570
I can say description and then give some value over there.

00:05:07.570 --> 00:05:10.580
Or if you want to have a description as an object,

00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:11.670
you can do the same thing.

00:05:11.670 --> 00:05:12.420
For example,

00:05:12.420 --> 00:05:13.780
I'm gonna cut this from here.

00:05:13.780 --> 00:05:15.450
Make that as another object.

00:05:15.450 --> 00:05:18.900
A shark message probably simply say is forbidden.

00:05:18.900 --> 00:05:19.770
Onda.

00:05:19.770 --> 00:05:23.350
Probably a longer description probably may give this entire message.

00:05:23.350 --> 00:05:25.810
You can also add additional stuff like,

00:05:25.810 --> 00:05:26.540
for example,

00:05:26.540 --> 00:05:27.600
a time stem,

00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:31.790
which is nothing but the date don't know which will give the times time.

00:05:31.790 --> 00:05:34.420
But if you want a readable date value,

00:05:34.420 --> 00:05:40.580
then probably you can say new date and then say dot to I s o string and that's going to

00:05:40.580 --> 00:05:42.570
give you a proper date value.

00:05:42.570 --> 00:05:43.940
Let's give it a try.

00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:48.210
I have to remove the authorization talking from here and then click the send.

00:05:48.210 --> 00:05:54.840
Now you can see we are able toe customize our response using the standard http exception.

00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:55.350
Plus,

00:05:55.350 --> 00:06:00.430
next year's provides a lot off sub classes for this http exception.

00:06:00.430 --> 00:06:00.880
Plus,

00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:04.210
here is the list off all those exception plus,

00:06:04.210 --> 00:06:05.430
is that you can make yourself.

00:06:05.430 --> 00:06:07.000
We have already seen,

00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:07.760
not phoned.

00:06:07.760 --> 00:06:08.490
Exception.

00:06:08.490 --> 00:06:12.470
You can also see that there is already a class called for but an exception which we could

00:06:12.470 --> 00:06:14.520
have used in the next lecture.

00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:17.140
Let's see how we can create our own user.

00:06:17.140 --> 00:06:18.500
Different exception plus.
