00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.110
while we were ableto get all the contacts in this lecture,

00:00:04.110 --> 00:00:08.600
Let's tryto access and unusual contact data based on the i d.

00:00:08.600 --> 00:00:13.080
So I really I should be able to send in a request to the same mural.

00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:13.600
But of course,

00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:14.090
at the end,

00:00:14.090 --> 00:00:15.910
I should give slash and the 90.

00:00:15.910 --> 00:00:17.650
So I'm gonna open a new tab,

00:00:17.650 --> 00:00:20.490
select the get request on that.

00:00:20.490 --> 00:00:24.000
This is gonna be locals 3000 slash contacts on an i.

00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:26.160
D andan active Constand.

00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:29.690
It should stretch the details off that particular idee,

00:00:29.690 --> 00:00:31.820
but in getting the idea is not there.

00:00:31.820 --> 00:00:32.920
We should get a four,

00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.490
not four.

00:00:33.490 --> 00:00:36.090
So that's going to implement the same thing for us.

00:00:36.090 --> 00:00:38.180
Let's go to the service over here.

00:00:38.180 --> 00:00:42.850
I'll a function probably called Get one contact,

00:00:42.850 --> 00:00:51.120
which receives idea that perimeter I I have to know Search decided in this member variable

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:51.120
.

00:00:51.120 --> 00:00:52.750
If it is phone,

00:00:52.750 --> 00:00:54.120
I should return that object.

00:00:54.120 --> 00:00:55.100
If it is not fun,

00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.020
it is okay,

00:00:56.020 --> 00:00:57.400
we're going to return undefined.

00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:02.000
So it's gonna be pretty much one liner over here and say return.

00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:05.380
They start contacts dark find,

00:01:05.380 --> 00:01:11.420
and then I supply a call back where I receive a single contract object and I check if it's

00:01:11.420 --> 00:01:14.450
I ve same as the idea that I passed the perimeter.

00:01:14.450 --> 00:01:15.540
If that is the case,

00:01:15.540 --> 00:01:16.950
it is going to return the object.

00:01:16.950 --> 00:01:19.060
But throughout the alteration,

00:01:19.060 --> 00:01:20.560
if it doesn't find that I d,

00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:22.450
then it's going to return undefined.

00:01:22.450 --> 00:01:28.750
That means if I have 10 objects and if the match is found in late to the 3rd 1 day duration

00:01:28.750 --> 00:01:31.300
stops over there and the third objective return.

00:01:31.300 --> 00:01:34.630
But if none other 10 objects match this condition,

00:01:34.630 --> 00:01:37.370
then at the end off the 10 reiteration,

00:01:37.370 --> 00:01:38.850
it's going to return an undefined.

00:01:38.850 --> 00:01:43.300
So let's go to the controller called dysfunction and see how that's gonna go.

00:01:43.300 --> 00:01:44.440
And this time,

00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:48.350
let me write a function called Get contact by idee,

00:01:48.350 --> 00:01:50.540
which takes ideas a perimeter,

00:01:50.540 --> 00:01:53.110
and this is supplied by the user.

00:01:53.110 --> 00:01:55.550
Why are the part perimeter of that segment?

00:01:55.550 --> 00:01:56.980
And if you remember,

00:01:56.980 --> 00:02:00.020
our contacts always had a function called exist.

00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:05.920
I can check your if this starts that we start exist and I supply the I D.

00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:07.280
If this is true,

00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.250
then I'm gonna say return.

00:02:09.250 --> 00:02:10.920
This starts are restored.

00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:14.190
Get one contract and then I supply the I D.

00:02:14.190 --> 00:02:16.560
But in case if it doesn't exist,

00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:21.170
then I simply have to come out of the if block and say through new,

00:02:21.170 --> 00:02:26.300
not phone exception Notice that I don't have to write an else because of the condition is

00:02:26.300 --> 00:02:26.730
true.

00:02:26.730 --> 00:02:27.830
It's going toe.

00:02:27.830 --> 00:02:31.670
Return the control away from this function and it will never reach over here.

00:02:31.670 --> 00:02:35.750
So only when the condition fails it comes here and then exception is thrown.

00:02:35.750 --> 00:02:41.280
And one last thing that we have to do toe map this function to the get request is to say

00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:45.170
that they get But we already have a get mapping here.

00:02:45.170 --> 00:02:47.350
This will be off no use.

00:02:47.350 --> 00:02:49.110
But we need to know.

00:02:49.110 --> 00:02:49.850
Say that head.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:53.300
The part may contain a segment which represents an I.

00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:53.510
D.

00:02:53.510 --> 00:02:57.150
And that is done by typing slash colon idee.

00:02:57.150 --> 00:02:59.350
This is your part segment.

00:02:59.350 --> 00:03:04.350
And then I'm gonna map that part segment to this variable by using at the rate problem and

00:03:04.350 --> 00:03:07.910
then supply the idea because whatever this segment name is there,

00:03:07.910 --> 00:03:12.350
that is the one that we have to use that would be assigned to this particular variable.

00:03:12.350 --> 00:03:18.600
And now let's go back to our postman and see if I'm able toe get the data for this contact

00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:21.860
to and the contact to currently represents Sham.

00:03:21.860 --> 00:03:26.890
Let's go here and then click the send and you can see that we got it on.

00:03:26.890 --> 00:03:27.960
If I supplies something,

00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.220
like,

00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.080
say to 22 which is an invalidity,

00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:33.100
I'm gonna get a for not for error.

00:03:33.100 --> 00:03:33.470
Here.

00:03:33.470 --> 00:03:35.230
There is a Jason object.

00:03:35.230 --> 00:03:35.850
Plus,

00:03:35.850 --> 00:03:38.850
you can see the status is for not for over here.
