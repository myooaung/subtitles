00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.130
in this lecture,

00:00:01.130 --> 00:00:03.400
let's deploy our application toe Hello.

00:00:03.400 --> 00:00:04.470
Coup on.

00:00:04.470 --> 00:00:09.440
But there are few changes that we may have to make in our so scored as the less mongo DB

00:00:09.440 --> 00:00:10.050
server.

00:00:10.050 --> 00:00:15.350
The first thing you have to do is tow not assume that this port number will be available in

00:00:15.350 --> 00:00:16.050
Haruko.

00:00:16.050 --> 00:00:18.400
We want toe ask heroic.

00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:18.540
Oh,

00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:18.920
that.

00:00:18.920 --> 00:00:20.640
Give me the port number.

00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:21.990
If you don't give them,

00:00:21.990 --> 00:00:25.160
I would like to use sport number 3000 to do that.

00:00:25.160 --> 00:00:32.600
Let's declare a variable called port equals toe process dot e and b dot port.

00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.160
If there is not available,

00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.450
let's take 3000 And now I'm gonna use the variable port instead of 3000 over here.

00:00:39.450 --> 00:00:44.650
The second thing is that when we deploy our application toe head aku,

00:00:44.650 --> 00:00:49.080
typically we access these restaurant points using applications like angular,

00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:52.040
our reactors deployed on a different server.

00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:56.450
So you won't be able to access this unless you enable something called cars.

00:00:56.450 --> 00:00:59.150
Cars stand for cross origin.

00:00:59.150 --> 00:01:04.850
Associating all you have to do is to say at dot enable cars.

00:01:04.850 --> 00:01:06.560
This will take her off,

00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:10.860
enabling cars by Aisling additional response headers.

00:01:10.860 --> 00:01:14.660
There is no other change required in our application.

00:01:14.660 --> 00:01:16.340
Our application is ready.

00:01:16.340 --> 00:01:17.180
However,

00:01:17.180 --> 00:01:20.220
when we deploy our application toe Haruko,

00:01:20.220 --> 00:01:24.110
the application running on Haruko will try to connect Mongo DB on mongo.

00:01:24.110 --> 00:01:25.950
DB will not allow that to happen.

00:01:25.950 --> 00:01:31.350
And this is family because in Mongo db we have enabled only the local I P address.

00:01:31.350 --> 00:01:35.310
Either we have to give the Heracles I P address are we can say,

00:01:35.310 --> 00:01:38.100
let our database be accessible from anywhere.

00:01:38.100 --> 00:01:41.270
So let's go to our mongo db dashboard on.

00:01:41.270 --> 00:01:43.260
You can see that there is a option toe.

00:01:43.260 --> 00:01:45.360
Connect the metrics collections.

00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:47.380
We have seen all these things here.

00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:49.990
There is an option toe change the network access.

00:01:49.990 --> 00:01:51.960
Let's click on the same as you can see.

00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:53.320
There's one entry here,

00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:56.950
which is nothing but my i p address my laptops I p address.

00:01:56.950 --> 00:02:01.400
I'm gonna delete this and then click on Add an I P address.

00:02:01.400 --> 00:02:04.750
And here is an option to say hello access from anywhere.

00:02:04.750 --> 00:02:05.630
Ideally,

00:02:05.630 --> 00:02:06.730
you shouldn't be doing this.

00:02:06.730 --> 00:02:11.150
He should give the actual white list address so that your baby is secure.

00:02:11.150 --> 00:02:13.430
But this is for a demo purpose.

00:02:13.430 --> 00:02:15.450
Instead of finding out what is the I.

00:02:15.450 --> 00:02:18.370
P address of Hiroko and adding that over here,

00:02:18.370 --> 00:02:24.350
let's click on confirm and now our Mongo DB database is accessible from any I P address

00:02:24.350 --> 00:02:27.560
before we actually go and start the deployment process.

00:02:27.560 --> 00:02:31.030
We also have to create an application in Heracles.

00:02:31.030 --> 00:02:35.290
So let's goto a new tab and then goto Haruko dot com.

00:02:35.290 --> 00:02:37.010
Since I already loved in,

00:02:37.010 --> 00:02:41.050
it takes me directly to my dashboard where I don't have any app.

00:02:41.050 --> 00:02:47.440
So the name of the APP must be unique among other applications deployed on Hiroko not only

00:02:47.440 --> 00:02:49.850
hours but by other developers Also.

00:02:49.850 --> 00:02:50.300
So,

00:02:50.300 --> 00:02:54.380
since my application is about next year's on the phone books,

00:02:54.380 --> 00:02:57.850
I'm gonna give the name as nest JSP phone book.

00:02:57.850 --> 00:03:00.390
Andi it will give me with that.

00:03:00.390 --> 00:03:01.410
It is available or not,

00:03:01.410 --> 00:03:01.720
it said.

00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:02.370
It's not days,

00:03:02.370 --> 00:03:03.350
so let's change the name,

00:03:03.350 --> 00:03:08.350
toe nest dash phone book and it says this is available.

00:03:08.350 --> 00:03:10.350
Let's click on Create Up.

00:03:10.350 --> 00:03:12.770
The next step is toe Link,

00:03:12.770 --> 00:03:16.510
this nest phone book application on the Hiroko toe,

00:03:16.510 --> 00:03:19.510
our application that's currently available on our desktop,

00:03:19.510 --> 00:03:23.660
and that is done with the help off the heroic Aussie ally that we have installed.

00:03:23.660 --> 00:03:27.270
So let's go to the terminal and issue the 11 commence.

00:03:27.270 --> 00:03:30.990
The first thing I have to do is to ensure that I'm on my project medically,

00:03:30.990 --> 00:03:35.360
which is the stop slash nest dash mongo db.

00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.180
That's demo.

00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:38.070
You should first use the gift,

00:03:38.070 --> 00:03:38.420
innit?

00:03:38.420 --> 00:03:40.170
Command toe initialize this.

00:03:40.170 --> 00:03:42.210
When we created the project,

00:03:42.210 --> 00:03:47.330
there was already a get initialization on just to make sure we're gonna initialize once

00:03:47.330 --> 00:03:49.790
more so you can see it says Grealish.

00:03:49.790 --> 00:03:54.540
Allies existing git repository on the second command usedto use the Haruko,

00:03:54.540 --> 00:03:55.590
see a light toe.

00:03:55.590 --> 00:04:01.050
Connect this application to the application that we have created on our Haruko dashboard.

00:04:01.050 --> 00:04:04.940
And that is done by typing the commander Hiroko space.

00:04:04.940 --> 00:04:12.320
Get colon remote dash a on the name of the application were created So the name is nothing

00:04:12.320 --> 00:04:20.450
but Nestor Dash phone book press enter and it is now said the get remote as get dot Haruko

00:04:20.450 --> 00:04:25.510
dot com slash nest dash phonebook target There a couple of steps that we have to take

00:04:25.510 --> 00:04:30.490
before we push our court to Haruko First we need to make sure that the environment is

00:04:30.490 --> 00:04:33.570
configured correctly by running these commands.

00:04:33.570 --> 00:04:41.040
The number one command is Hiroko Config Colon set NPM underscore conflict under scope

00:04:41.040 --> 00:04:43.460
production equals toe once,

00:04:43.460 --> 00:04:50.260
and the second command is Hiroko Conflict Colon set nor underscore.

00:04:50.260 --> 00:04:52.830
PNV is nothing but production now.

00:04:52.830 --> 00:04:55.050
Most likely this has already been set,

00:04:55.050 --> 00:04:58.450
but we're just making sure that it is said to production.

00:04:58.450 --> 00:05:02.020
Heroic also expects a file called Rock File.

00:05:02.020 --> 00:05:06.690
This is the file that acts like the initial file to be read by Haruko.

00:05:06.690 --> 00:05:11.160
And this is where we mentioned what is the actual Commander Hiroko should run so that our

00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.750
application starts.

00:05:12.750 --> 00:05:22.050
And here I can simply type equal Web colon on the Commander's NPM Iran start colon prod.

00:05:22.050 --> 00:05:24.050
So we want to run the production wash in.

00:05:24.050 --> 00:05:27.790
This has to be appended to a file called Brock.

00:05:27.790 --> 00:05:28.250
Fine.

00:05:28.250 --> 00:05:30.220
And if the file doesn't exist,

00:05:30.220 --> 00:05:31.470
it gets created.

00:05:31.470 --> 00:05:32.830
Let's press enter.

00:05:32.830 --> 00:05:39.330
And now we are ready toe push the court from our desktop toe the Haruko get repository and

00:05:39.330 --> 00:05:44.600
this in walls typically three commence number one is toe Add all the files that we want and

00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:49.650
we want to add all the files and the fights that we don't want to send their already being

00:05:49.650 --> 00:05:51.560
listed in the get ignore.

00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:52.910
If you go back to the court,

00:05:52.910 --> 00:05:58.320
you can see that there is a get ignore on the slash days to slash North models.

00:05:58.320 --> 00:06:03.610
All these fights will be ignored and only our source code would be added toe the Haruko

00:06:03.610 --> 00:06:04.280
repository.

00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.600
So let's press enter.

00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:13.800
The second command is toe commit so the commanders get commit dash M and some message in it

00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:14.320
to give.

00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.600
This will help us identify different get comets.

00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:18.390
Let's pressed.

00:06:18.390 --> 00:06:20.670
Enter the last comment toe push.

00:06:20.670 --> 00:06:23.660
Our court is get push heroic.

00:06:23.660 --> 00:06:24.020
Oh,

00:06:24.020 --> 00:06:25.450
and then master.

00:06:25.450 --> 00:06:29.380
So when we presented our it's going to start the deployment process.

00:06:29.380 --> 00:06:35.980
Rest enter and you can also go back to the browser on If you go back to your nest phone

00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:37.990
book or probably few refresh over here,

00:06:37.990 --> 00:06:40.100
you can see it's this building progress.

00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.350
So let's go back to the command front on Did saying here will be succeeded.

00:06:45.350 --> 00:06:52.980
So it has given us a Ural here hits to TPS Colon double slash nested ash phonebook dot

00:06:52.980 --> 00:06:54.350
Haruko at dot com.

00:06:54.350 --> 00:06:58.170
So if I try to access this Ural on the browser,

00:06:58.170 --> 00:07:01.260
I should get the hello world message as well.

00:07:01.260 --> 00:07:02.830
If I say slash contacts,

00:07:02.830 --> 00:07:07.300
I should get the list off on the context that we have in our mongo db.

00:07:07.300 --> 00:07:09.750
So let's go to the browser and test the same thing.

00:07:09.750 --> 00:07:13.350
I'm gonna open a new tab based that press enter.

00:07:13.350 --> 00:07:15.350
You can see you got a lower message.

00:07:15.350 --> 00:07:18.870
And if I type your slash contacts,

00:07:18.870 --> 00:07:20.920
I have only one contact,

00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:22.850
and that comes as an area here.

00:07:22.850 --> 00:07:26.830
Let's go toe postman either contact and very for the same.

00:07:26.830 --> 00:07:27.990
So let's copy this.

00:07:27.990 --> 00:07:31.450
You are Goto Postman at a new tab.

00:07:31.450 --> 00:07:34.990
Let's make a post request toe this year.

00:07:34.990 --> 00:07:35.550
Orel,

00:07:35.550 --> 00:07:38.270
that's like the body wrong.

00:07:38.270 --> 00:07:40.450
I'm gonna select Jason from here.

00:07:40.450 --> 00:07:43.410
The minimum requirements are name,

00:07:43.410 --> 00:07:44.400
email and phone.

00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:44.750
Of course,

00:07:44.750 --> 00:07:46.190
if I don't send that data,

00:07:46.190 --> 00:07:48.150
we should have some others,

00:07:48.150 --> 00:07:52.330
and you can see that it is Name must be there as well as email.

00:07:52.330 --> 00:07:52.640
Must be.

00:07:52.640 --> 00:07:56.570
Their phone must be there on the validations that we have created.

00:07:56.570 --> 00:07:58.250
So let's go and type in a name.

00:07:58.250 --> 00:08:01.550
Let's say show female.

00:08:01.550 --> 00:08:08.020
That's give some at example dot com on a dummy phone number.

00:08:08.020 --> 00:08:12.810
Make sure to include the country cord because that's as part of the validation.

00:08:12.810 --> 00:08:15.550
Let's give some arbitrary numbers.

00:08:15.550 --> 00:08:17.660
Click on send on.

00:08:17.660 --> 00:08:22.100
I got another saying Phone must be a valid for number because I missed the one digit over

00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:22.390
here.

00:08:22.390 --> 00:08:24.050
So let's have some dummy number.

00:08:24.050 --> 00:08:30.250
Click on send again and you can see we got ourselves a new document.

00:08:30.250 --> 00:08:33.800
So if I copy this on goto a new tab,

00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:35.150
make a get request,

00:08:35.150 --> 00:08:37.770
we should see two documents.

00:08:37.770 --> 00:08:43.380
So congratulations were successfully able toe deploy our application on toe.

00:08:43.380 --> 00:08:46.950
A very popular cloud based server car.

00:08:46.950 --> 00:08:47.440
Heroic.

00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:47.650
Ooh.
