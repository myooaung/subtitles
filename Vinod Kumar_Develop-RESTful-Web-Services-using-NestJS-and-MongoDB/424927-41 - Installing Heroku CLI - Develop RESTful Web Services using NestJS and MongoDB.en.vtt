00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.190
in this lecture,

00:00:01.190 --> 00:00:03.120
let's install head Oecussi a light.

00:00:03.120 --> 00:00:08.040
The installation procedure is a bit different on different operating system on.

00:00:08.040 --> 00:00:10.650
They're all very well explained over here.

00:00:10.650 --> 00:00:14.140
So if I click on this download and install link,

00:00:14.140 --> 00:00:16.330
you can see that it is on backwards.

00:00:16.330 --> 00:00:19.670
I have to copy and paste this command on the terminal,

00:00:19.670 --> 00:00:21.250
but as on Windows,

00:00:21.250 --> 00:00:23.620
you have a 64 bit installer.

00:00:23.620 --> 00:00:26.070
Download this and double click the installer.

00:00:26.070 --> 00:00:27.090
It'll open up.

00:00:27.090 --> 00:00:32.340
A reserve finishes the task on Lenox operating system like pronto.

00:00:32.340 --> 00:00:35.910
You can copy this and based it on a terminal press.

00:00:35.910 --> 00:00:36.520
Enter.

00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:38.370
The installation is going to be done.

00:00:38.370 --> 00:00:39.790
Apart from these three,

00:00:39.790 --> 00:00:40.880
there are other methods.

00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:41.580
For example,

00:00:41.580 --> 00:00:43.810
we have install NPM.

00:00:43.810 --> 00:00:48.510
We can use the NPM install Dash G Haruko Comment to install the C.

00:00:48.510 --> 00:00:48.690
L.

00:00:48.690 --> 00:00:48.790
A.

00:00:48.790 --> 00:00:50.150
As well here.

00:00:50.150 --> 00:00:54.890
It says it's strongly recommended that you use one of the other installation methods is

00:00:54.890 --> 00:00:55.490
possible.

00:00:55.490 --> 00:01:00.310
This particular installation matter does not auto update and records you to use your

00:01:00.310 --> 00:01:05.630
systems washing off Noches which may be older than the Washington Haruko develops the cli

00:01:05.630 --> 00:01:06.250
agonist.

00:01:06.250 --> 00:01:06.940
However,

00:01:06.940 --> 00:01:08.040
in the beginning of the course,

00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:10.350
we installed the latest version of Norges.

00:01:10.350 --> 00:01:12.680
We probably may not run into this problem,

00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.950
so I'm gonna use this NPM install Dash G.

00:01:15.950 --> 00:01:18.490
Hiroko Since I'm using mac ways,

00:01:18.490 --> 00:01:21.160
I have to also perfect the same thing with pseudo.

00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:22.400
This is same thing,

00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:26.960
even for a bento or any other leaners For Windows users,

00:01:26.960 --> 00:01:29.900
you can just open a new command prompt and type in this command.

00:01:29.900 --> 00:01:31.820
So I'm gonna go to the new terminal,

00:01:31.820 --> 00:01:40.680
type in the commands pseudo npm install dash G Haruko with and don't enter the Super User

00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:41.260
password.

00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:46.160
It took a couple of minutes for me toe finish the installation.

00:01:46.160 --> 00:01:53.390
Now I can type your hair Coco dat stash Watson and we see the Washington installed.

00:01:53.390 --> 00:01:55.230
Now using the heroic Basilea,

00:01:55.230 --> 00:01:57.910
we have to log in to the conduct we have created.

00:01:57.910 --> 00:02:01.770
So I'm gonna take your heroic ooh space log in press enter.

00:02:01.770 --> 00:02:03.010
So it says,

00:02:03.010 --> 00:02:04.060
press any Kato,

00:02:04.060 --> 00:02:11.530
open the browser to log in our Q toe exit and press enter and it has opened this dialog box

00:02:11.530 --> 00:02:17.210
all have to do is to click this logging thereby were attended gating heroic OSI Lato access

00:02:17.210 --> 00:02:22.270
our confidence and it says you can close this page on Britain to your sea life.

00:02:22.270 --> 00:02:26.240
So that's going to close this one and you can see it is long.

00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.430
Dennis Chire tired.

00:02:27.430 --> 00:02:32.780
What we know at gmail dot com Now that we have the heroic Aussie ally ready and logged in,

00:02:32.780 --> 00:02:37.060
we can now push our court from our desktop to the Haruko Sarwer.
